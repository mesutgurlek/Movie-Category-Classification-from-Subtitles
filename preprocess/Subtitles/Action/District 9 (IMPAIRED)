1
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:53,211
You know, after last year's corporate,
my wife was always encouraging me.

2
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:56,609
You know, she said: you did fine,
you did fine in the corporate.

3
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:59,682
I was a bit nervous.
This little guy... hello. Sorry.

4
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:02,945
That's nice, eh? Nice background
with the people there...

5
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,602
We are here at the... must I look..?
-Just look straight at the lens.

6
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:09,418
We are here at the...
MNU head office,

7
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,719
Department of Alien Affairs.
My name is Wikus Van De Merwe.

8
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:16,146
And behind me you can see
the Alien Affairs' workers.

9
00:01:16,338 --> 00:01:19,283
And what we do here
at this department is...

10
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,068
we try to engage with the Prawn

11
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:26,197
on behalf of MNU
and on behalf of humans.

12
00:01:28,126 --> 00:01:31,649
To everyone's surprise,
the ship didn't come to a stop

13
00:01:31,746 --> 00:01:34,591
over Manhattan
or Washington or Chicago,

14
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:38,912
but instead it costed to a halt
directly over the city of Johannesburg.

15
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:45,549
The doors didn't open for 3 months.
It just hovered there. Nobody could get in.

16
00:01:45,741 --> 00:01:48,266
And they eventually decided,
after much deliberation,

17
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:52,394
that the best thing to do would be
to physically cut their way in.

18
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:02,808
We were on the verge
of first contact.

19
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:06,647
The whole world was watching.

20
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:09,028
Expecting, I don't know...

21
00:02:09,124 --> 00:02:12,092
...music from heaven
and bright shining lights.

22
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:18,909
Oh my God!

23
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,713
The creatures were
extremely malnourished,

24
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:33,178
they were very unhealthy,
they seemed to be aimless.

25
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,317
There was a lot of international
pressure on us at the time.

26
00:02:36,413 --> 00:02:38,817
The entire world was
looking at Johannesburg,

27
00:02:38,914 --> 00:02:41,026
so we had to do the right thing.

28
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:44,069
The government then established
an aid group that started to

29
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:48,262
ferry the aliens to a temporary camp
set up just beneath the ship.

30
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:52,972
We didn't have a plan.
There was a million of them.

31
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:57,522
So, what was a temporary
holding zone soon became fenced,

32
00:02:57,618 --> 00:03:01,524
became militarized. And before
we knew it, it was a slum.

33
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:05,209
But the truth is, nobody really
knew what this place was.

34
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:08,217
There's a lot of secrets
in District 9.

35
00:03:17,382 --> 00:03:20,384
At first, a lot of attention
was given to...

36
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:23,745
giving the aliens a proper status
and protection.

37
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,926
They're spending so much money
to keep them here.

38
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:29,936
When they could be spending it
on other things, but...

39
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:33,908
...at least they're keeping them
separate from us.

40
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:42,010
l want to be realistic with everyone.
The aliens will not be able to go home.

41
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,828
The aliens are here to stay.

42
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,524
There were literally thousands
of different theories

43
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:51,461
as to why the ship seemed inoperable,
and what was speculated was that

44
00:03:51,652 --> 00:03:54,568
the command module had detached
itself from the main ship,

45
00:03:54,664 --> 00:03:56,970
and then somehow
mysteriously became lost.

46
00:03:57,258 --> 00:04:02,275
Did it fall by itself or was it
programmed? I don't know.

47
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:05,289
Examination of the
old video footage

48
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:09,322
shows very clearly
that a piece falls from the ship.

49
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,751
We look for it.
We look everywhere.

50
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:17,344
This piece that's falling
caused us bloody problems.

51
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,779
More energy weapon caches found.

52
00:04:19,876 --> 00:04:22,562
The Special task force
conducted raids in District 9.

53
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:25,958
Where there's a weapon, there's crime.
Tensions rose, and rose.

54
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:29,704
People became more and more fed up,
and eventually the rioting started.

55
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:33,257
Residents in Tembisa rioted
for the third consecutive night

56
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:36,810
in an attempt to remove
all the aliens from their township.

57
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:45,163
I think they must fix that ship
and they must go.

58
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,716
A virus, a selective virus.
Release it near the aliens.

59
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:52,028
They must just go.
I don't know where, just go.

60
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:54,525
If they was from another country
we might understand.

61
00:04:54,622 --> 00:04:56,445
But they are not
even from this planet.

62
00:04:56,642 --> 00:04:59,141
The government have enforced
a nationwide curfew.

63
00:04:59,237 --> 00:05:02,313
The aliens, prawns,
they take my wife away.

64
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:05,966
The derogatory term Prawn is used
for the alien, and obviously it implies

65
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:09,936
something that is a bottom feeder,
that scavenges the leftovers.

66
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:12,275
I mean, you can't say
they don't look like that.

67
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:14,549
That's what they look like, right?
They look like prawns.

68
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:19,031
The aliens made off with an undisclosed
amount of cash. One bystander was hurt.

69
00:05:19,225 --> 00:05:22,398
What for an alien might be seen
as something recreational,

70
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:25,504
setting fire to a truck,
derailing a train,

71
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,929
is for us obviously
an extremely destructive act.

72
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:33,345
They can take the sneakers
you are wearing off you.

73
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:36,801
They take whatever you have on you.
Your cell phone or anything.

74
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:39,586
After that they kill you.

75
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,311
And now, after 20 years, public
pressure had forced the government

76
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:46,096
to shift the aliens
out of Johannesburg.

77
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:49,977
They had had enough and they
wanted District 9 to be moved,

78
00:05:50,074 --> 00:05:52,282
and more intensively
policed and controlled.

79
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:55,996
So, to enforce this mass eviction,
the government turned to MNU.

80
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:58,462
Welcome all
and thank you for coming.

81
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:01,339
Please listen very closely
to this briefing.

82
00:06:01,537 --> 00:06:05,181
Today we start a very complex
and delicate operation.

83
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:10,764
This is the largest operation
that MNU has ever undertaken,

84
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,833
and we believe that it is going
to be undertaken successfully.

85
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:18,098
It is to move 1.8 million prawns

86
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:22,803
from their present home in District 9
to a safer and better location

87
00:06:22,993 --> 00:06:26,646
200 kilometers outside of
Johannesburg City.

88
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:29,628
We built a nice new facility
where the prawn can go,

89
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:32,448
he can be comfortable,
he can stay there...

90
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,317
The people of Johannesburg and
of South Africa are going to live

91
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:40,516
happily and safely, knowing that
that prawn is very far away.

92
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,686
UIO protocol dictates
that we give the aliens

93
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,335
24 hours notice
of our right to evict.

94
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:53,811
Today, you will serve these notices
getting the aliens to sign I-27 form.

95
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:58,642
The legality that MNU is using to evict
the aliens is simply a whitewash.

96
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:03,442
I'm going to appoint a field officer
to take direct command.

97
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:06,102
Wikus Van De Merwe.

98
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:09,559
Everybody always said that
Wikus was not a very smart boy,

99
00:07:09,656 --> 00:07:13,112
but he was a wonderful son.
That was my Wikus, just...

100
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,833
Feels like life on the big stage.
Thank you Piet... Mr Smith.

101
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:24,330
l had to put aside the fact that
my daughter was married to Wikus.

102
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:28,372
That didn't affect my decision
to promote him.

103
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:33,046
It's almost as big as my wedding day.
You know... not as big.

104
00:07:33,657 --> 00:07:35,894
Wikus was always making me things.

105
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:38,871
He said that way
they just mean so much more.

106
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:41,889
He left this paper-mache bowl
on the sofa one day

107
00:07:41,985 --> 00:07:46,074
and I didn't see it and I sat down,
and I... kinda squashed it.

108
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:50,217
They took all his stuff away
for the investigation, and...

109
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,387
I made them bring it all back.

110
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:55,364
Hey, congratulations, man!
-Thanks, man.

111
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:58,725
Okay, you're gonna go to P7.
-Wikus! -How is it going, man?

112
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:01,452
Here's the shake.
P9 for you. -Thanks.

113
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,281
I'm not saying
what he did was right, but...

114
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:07,128
he took the choices
that were given to him.

115
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:09,913
This is Trent.
Fundiswa, Trent. -Hi.

116
00:08:10,202 --> 00:08:12,986
Fundiswa is the guy that
I've selected to replace me.

117
00:08:13,087 --> 00:08:15,872
If he can make it today, eh?
-I'll make it.

118
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:18,945
I just want everyone
watching this right now

119
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:22,438
to learn from what has happened.
-You would think...

120
00:08:22,726 --> 00:08:26,217
things like this would happen
to somebody else, not to me.

121
00:08:27,946 --> 00:08:31,210
How is it going, man? Long time,
mate. Have you got my stuff?

122
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,186
Hey, boss! -How is it going?
-I'm all right, boss.

123
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:36,779
Good, good, this is Fundiswa.
He is training with us today.

124
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:39,659
I think I was disgusted with
the way he worked.

125
00:08:39,756 --> 00:08:42,636
There was always just a hint
of something not quite kosher

126
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:45,420
with mr Van De Merwe.
-Nobody saw it coming at all.

127
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:48,128
None of us had any idea
of what he was doing.

128
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,658
l think it is a great
thing to see that...

129
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:52,868
it's not the military guys
in charge this time.

130
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:55,108
Not to say that Koobus
and his cowboys are not wanted.

131
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:57,125
You guys are always wanted.

132
00:08:57,384 --> 00:08:59,941
You see now,
these are the cowboys.

133
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:04,166
They shoot first, and then
they answer the questions.

134
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:07,599
Sorry, is this above the allocated
amount of ammunition?

135
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:09,808
Because I see your
pouches are full but...

136
00:09:09,904 --> 00:09:12,784
I think maybe you should
speak to the colonel.

137
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,789
F.A.G. over here says that
we got too much ammunition.

138
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,425
No, all I'm saying, Koobus,
is that, you know...

139
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:22,426
you should find ways of making
you guys more efficient...

140
00:09:22,523 --> 00:09:24,635
Listen to me, you fuck!

141
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,652
Get him outta my face.

142
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:31,068
There are rules, we're all living
by rules in this world.

143
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:34,444
Well, l don't think he can
be forgiven for what he did,

144
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:37,455
cause it's like a betrayal.
-I've gotta get going, Les.

145
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:41,425
I think we're gonna have to cut
this interview, cause we're gonna go...

146
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:54,866
12 KILOMETERS FROM DISTRICT 9

147
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:07,468
Take your magazines, people.
Come on, lets go.

148
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:11,952
The Prawn doesn't really understand
the concept of ownership of property.

149
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:15,567
So, we have to come there and say:
listen, this is our land.

150
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:18,258
Please, will you go?

151
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:23,635
It's difficult to put
the vest on by yourself.

152
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:25,652
Thomas, can you help me?
-All right, boss.

153
00:10:25,753 --> 00:10:28,246
They told me I was gonna
get the vest inside the Casper.

154
00:10:28,352 --> 00:10:31,040
Thomas, just look on the side
if there's a vest there?

155
00:10:31,137 --> 00:10:34,209
I'm just concerned about my family.
-Don't worry about the vest, it'll be fine.

156
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:37,385
Rights groups have demanded
that mercenaries should comply

157
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:40,358
with all UYO regulations
in District 9.

158
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:43,950
We're coming to you
from the entrance of District 9

159
00:10:44,046 --> 00:10:47,698
as today, Multi National United
sets out to relocate

160
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:51,606
approximately 1.8 million
alien residents from their homes.

161
00:10:51,702 --> 00:10:54,552
Human rights groups are
keeping a watchful eye,

162
00:10:54,648 --> 00:10:57,590
as many suspect
abuses might occur.

163
00:11:13,387 --> 00:11:16,552
We're seeing heavily armed
private security forces

164
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,049
being deployed into District 9.

165
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:22,217
Backed up by
significant air support.

166
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,820
We'll go shack to shack
and get them to sign the form.

167
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:36,605
First one EX 247.

168
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:41,278
We're seeing the convoy stop.
The operation is about to begin.

169
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,175
Just stay focused.

170
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,344
Are you ready, Thomas?
-Yeah. -Okay.

171
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:54,566
Is that a signal?
Okay, fellows.

172
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:57,679
You stay behind us.
Good luck, boy.

173
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,240
Stay low! Where is he going?
What is it?

174
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:11,793
It's clear that security is very high.

175
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,346
This is only the beginning
of a total clamp down.

176
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:28,651
This is MNU agents.
Open the door please! -Open up!

177
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:34,674
Hello! Hello, hello...

178
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:38,224
This is Wikus Van De Merwe
from MNU.

179
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:40,630
We are here to serve you
an eviction notice.

180
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:43,414
You just put your scrawl there.
-Fuck off!

181
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:46,720
All right! Thomas, hold it!
We've got his scrawl there.

182
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:50,081
Because as he hit it,
it counts as a scrawl.

183
00:12:51,426 --> 00:12:53,921
First time we come in,
there will always be a little bit

184
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:56,514
of tension happening
between us and them.

185
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,116
Hey, you can't eat that, man!

186
00:12:59,217 --> 00:13:02,190
The prawn likes to eat the rubber.
To him it's like a marshmallow.

187
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,454
No, no! Guard!
Don't confront him like that!

188
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:11,694
Did you see that?
Right in the roost. Stay calm!

189
00:13:14,286 --> 00:13:17,166
This is gonna be a problem cause
now all prawns are coming out,

190
00:13:17,268 --> 00:13:19,938
they wanna see what's going on.
Stop it! Stop it!

191
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:22,629
Bring my kit.
See, everybody is gathering now.

192
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:25,441
Don't shoot or you're gonna
turn it into a warzone!

193
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:28,425
What is that? Is that a tear gas?
-No, it's cat food.

194
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:30,859
It is cat food.
I just distract them.

195
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:36,043
One of them attacked the prawn
and he's lost his arm.

196
00:13:38,827 --> 00:13:42,283
No it's not my house.
I don't live here.

197
00:13:42,668 --> 00:13:45,356
Well, that's a pity because,
you know, this...

198
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:49,388
This is a nice cat food, you know.
But of course, it's not your house.

199
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:52,461
So, we'll just have to go and give it
to someone else. -Yes! It's my house!

200
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:55,615
We need you to sign here.
Now you can take that...

201
00:13:55,942 --> 00:13:58,111
All right. Stop it!

202
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,517
The creatures became incredibly
obsessed with cat food.

203
00:14:01,613 --> 00:14:05,860
Something about it, like catnip
for cats. Only a lot more intense.

204
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:15,446
Hello? MNU. We are here
to serve eviction notices.

205
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:18,039
What is eviction?

206
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:21,597
What we have stranded
on Earth in this colony,

207
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:24,830
is basically the workers that are
unable to think for themselves.

208
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:27,614
They will take commands,
they have no initiative.

209
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:30,013
They've lost all the
apt of leadership

210
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,989
through whatever cause.
We presume illness.

211
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:38,846
I'm holding steady over
Nigerian compound area.

212
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:52,671
Where there's a slum, there's crime.
And District 9 was no exception.

213
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:57,626
The nigerians had various scams going.
One of them was the cat food scam.

214
00:14:57,915 --> 00:15:01,563
Where they sold cat food to
the aliens for exorbitant prices.

215
00:15:01,852 --> 00:15:05,691
You put the money here first.
You don't get anything until you pay.

216
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:10,876
What are you trying to do?
I'll chop your balls off.

217
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:13,874
Not to mention
interspecies prostitution,

218
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:16,563
and they also dealt
in alien weaponry.

219
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:19,060
You have a car hijacking,
there's a chop shop there,

220
00:15:19,157 --> 00:15:21,269
you can see that,
that's somebody's car in there.

221
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:25,589
The nigerians in District 9 are
headed by a man called Obesandjo.

222
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:28,854
He's a very powerful
underground figure in Johannesburg.

223
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,972
You don't want to play
with these boys.

224
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:33,181
They will cut you into pieces.

225
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:37,669
That's the boss there.
OK, no problem.

226
00:15:38,056 --> 00:15:41,568
Don't look at him!
This is gonna cause problems.

227
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:48,364
All right, next. 766, all right.

228
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,732
MNU agents.
Open the door please!

229
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,831
Whoa! Jesus! What is it?

230
00:15:55,608 --> 00:15:58,576
Check the other side!

231
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,823
Control, this is Wikus Van De Merwe.

232
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,760
I need a population control team
at JV 766 immediately, please.

233
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:09,436
Check the other side, Thomas!
There is 40 to 50 eggs in here.

234
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:12,605
Is this normal?
-This is an amazing find.

235
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:14,858
l can just show you
a little bit how it works.

236
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,868
Basically, a cow is hung from
the ceiling, you can see here.

237
00:16:17,964 --> 00:16:20,878
Very little of it left, of course,
because all these pipes

238
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:23,855
supply the nutrition
to the little prawn eggs.

239
00:16:24,178 --> 00:16:27,635
You can do one, I can show you,
want to see? -No, I'm fine.

240
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:30,228
There we go. Okay,
no more nutrition to the guy.

241
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:33,048
Then finally we take air back.

242
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:36,025
The little guy is gone
to a nice little sleep now.

243
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,454
You pop him out, there we go.
Pop him out here.

244
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:43,493
You can take that. You wanna keep it
as a souvenir of your first abortion.

245
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:46,691
You can feel like you did
one of these here. -Thanks, boss.

246
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:51,396
Okay, here it comes, guys.
This is the snake.

247
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:55,044
If we were going to abort
each egg one at the time,

248
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:58,404
it'd take a very long time.
So, this makes a lot of sense.

249
00:16:58,804 --> 00:17:02,133
You hear that? That's a popping
sound that you're hearing.

250
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,209
It's almost like a popcorn.

251
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:06,802
What the egg does, it pops up.

252
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:09,779
The little guy, what's left of him,
pops out there.

253
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:12,921
So that's the sound that
you're hearing with the popping.

254
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:16,090
You don't need that, man.
Only sissies wear that.

255
00:17:16,763 --> 00:17:19,067
Been drinking a little bit here, eh?

256
00:17:20,264 --> 00:17:24,095
What are you doing with this
television set, sir? What's this?

257
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,350
Hey, smile for the cameras here.

258
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,170
That's a first day find.
-That's a big find.

259
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:32,976
You see this? Trent, look at this!
There's weapons all over here.

260
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:35,445
CK 5, 7572...

261
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:38,709
Some of the guns are small

262
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:42,070
but if it shoot you,
it make a big mess.

263
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:50,182
MNU is trying to move the aliens
for humanitarian reasons.

264
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,391
But the real focus,
just as it has been

265
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,984
right from the beginning,
is weapons.

266
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:59,117
MNU is the second largest
weapons manufacturer in the world.

267
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:02,130
We assumed that we'd be able
to pick up the alien laser gun

268
00:18:02,227 --> 00:18:04,915
and just be able to shoot,
but it didn't work like that.

269
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,572
Because, as we discovered,
their technology is actually

270
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:11,125
engineered in a biological manner
to interact exclusively with their DNA.

271
00:18:11,227 --> 00:18:14,900
It just doesn't work with humans.
And it's as simple as that.

272
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:18,493
This is basically a guy,
and there's 3 humans here.

273
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,217
Basically trying to make
a warning, you know.

274
00:18:21,315 --> 00:18:24,416
He's saying "I kill 3 humans,
watch out for me."

275
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,775
Hey, don't urinate on your
own bloody... get back, get back.

276
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:33,055
This is Wikus, requesting
First Battalion escort, please.

277
00:18:34,575 --> 00:18:37,869
You want to talk to them
or you want to talk to me?

278
00:18:38,062 --> 00:18:40,558
No, not them!

279
00:18:46,511 --> 00:18:49,966
Okay, guys, thanks very much.
Yeah I know, he had a spade.

280
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:08,305
Look-I find some!

281
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,625
I tell you before... this is
human technology, it is useless.

282
00:19:12,855 --> 00:19:15,889
Only our technology
contains the fluid.

283
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:19,710
This is not our technology?
-No, it's junk.

284
00:19:19,873 --> 00:19:21,793
Keep looking.

285
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:26,228
I find something.

286
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:30,124
Yes. This is what we need.

287
00:19:30,307 --> 00:19:32,659
Good, little one.

288
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,937
Get down!

289
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:49,977
Careful... wait...

290
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:52,223
...there.

291
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,823
Why must it take so long?

292
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:58,905
Because it is very difficult...

293
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,025
...so much can go wrong.

294
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:16,193
Twenty years of work.

295
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:19,822
Our plan is ready now?
-Quiet... listen...

296
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:23,949
...they are coming.

297
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,596
You must hide this.
They must not find it.

298
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:37,936
Answer the door and be polite.

299
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:40,433
No! You take it.

300
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:44,421
You see, this is the problem.
This is the gang sign.

301
00:20:44,556 --> 00:20:47,086
You see this? So again,
looks like we have

302
00:20:47,183 --> 00:20:49,487
more and more gang members.

303
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:52,080
Fundiswa, you just stay back.
You stay behind Thomas.

304
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:55,633
This place is swarming with MNU.
I will be searched.

305
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,570
I must get back to my son.
Don't make them angry - be polite!

306
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,099
MNU agents, open the door please.

307
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:06,460
Hello? We would like you to...
-Nobody is here.

308
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:10,004
Okay, that's unexceptable.
That is totally unexceptable!

309
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,058
Get out! Get out!
You stupid prawn!

310
00:21:13,352 --> 00:21:16,255
-Get outside!
-C'mon! Move! Move!

311
00:21:26,228 --> 00:21:28,972
On your knees!
-I'm gonna have a look.

312
00:21:29,082 --> 00:21:31,063
Just stay there!
Right there!

313
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:33,941
Sir, we have to serve you
an eviction notice.

314
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:35,958
Do you understand it?
-No.

315
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,134
This is a classic kind of
gangsta shack, I can tell you.

316
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,944
We're gonna find weapons here.
Watch your head, don't hit the cows.

317
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:46,148
Just checking for panels.
Ah, you hear that?

318
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,678
Yeah, it's hollow there.

319
00:21:49,513 --> 00:21:51,808
See? Look at that!

320
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,597
I haven't see this type of setup.
It's almost like a...

321
00:21:55,855 --> 00:21:58,351
chemistry type of a set.

322
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:01,520
It's gotta be something.

323
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:15,296
l don't know, this has got
the markings there of...

324
00:22:15,488 --> 00:22:18,211
...so it is definitely alien.

325
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,956
But it's not a weapon.
But I don't trust it.

326
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:28,197
Are you all right?
Wikus, are you all right?

327
00:22:33,574 --> 00:22:36,454
Switch it off, please.
Just turn it off.

328
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:39,909
Are you gonna cut that part out,
Trent, where it sprays me?

329
00:22:40,006 --> 00:22:42,118
-Yeah, don't worry.
-You cut that.

330
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:45,399
We just found
a dangerous object here.

331
00:22:45,726 --> 00:22:49,923
It has a fuel in and I suspect it might
leak onto people or cause damage.

332
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:53,766
So we just check that in and we
take that down nicely to the lab.

333
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:56,072
It's not a weapon
but it's dangerous.

334
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:59,436
He's got weapons somewhere here,
my sense is telling me that.

335
00:22:59,532 --> 00:23:02,157
Lets check the other side here.
Thomas! -Yes sir?

336
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,551
Thomas, keep the gun on him.
-OK, I got it sir!

337
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:07,562
Keep the gun on him, Thomas,
there's weapons here!

338
00:23:08,214 --> 00:23:11,511
Oh, this is Christmas!
This is Christmas, my friends.

339
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,065
This is the biggest find
that I've ever seen.

340
00:23:14,162 --> 00:23:16,308
Control, come in.
Wikus Van De Merwe,

341
00:23:16,405 --> 00:23:19,092
requesting
First Reaction Battalion.

342
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:25,621
Stand by, guys!

343
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:28,806
This gun I've never seen.
Have you seen this?

344
00:23:28,903 --> 00:23:31,975
This is amazing! Look at this gun.
What gun is this?

345
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:34,218
This is absolutely amazing!

346
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:36,619
-What are you doing?
-I wanna show this to Thomas.

347
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:38,636
But I thought you said
you can't handle it.

348
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,653
No, I am not handling it,
I'm just gonna show it.

349
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,630
I'm not gonna use it, man.
It doesn't even work with humans.

350
00:23:43,727 --> 00:23:46,031
Thomas, look at this gun!

351
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:50,832
-That's not mine.
-You're a dealer, eh? -No.

352
00:23:52,318 --> 00:23:54,816
You hear this, sir?
You see what's happening?

353
00:23:54,912 --> 00:23:57,464
First Battalion, my friend.
You know what that means?

354
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,057
That means that your days
of flaunting the law are over.

355
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:02,458
Have a look, you see that?
What's that?

356
00:24:02,555 --> 00:24:04,667
That's a firing team.

357
00:24:30,755 --> 00:24:32,506
Come here!

358
00:24:32,603 --> 00:24:34,713
Wikus! Are you all right?

359
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:37,690
Where do you think
you're going, eh?

360
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:41,259
You don't run away
from the chopper. -No, no...

361
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:44,839
Where do you think you're going?
You wanna piss me off?

362
00:24:52,728 --> 00:24:55,223
Koobus to base, come in!

363
00:24:55,897 --> 00:24:59,804
I've got two people down.
MNU guard, MNU agent.

364
00:25:00,956 --> 00:25:03,836
It's the Foxtrot Yankee
5-3-0... copy?

365
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:06,525
And we need a Med Evac ASAP.

366
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:09,406
No, that's fine, Koobus.
I don't need a Med Evac.

367
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:11,872
Wikus, you burned your arm,
you need to...

368
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,849
I'll just treat it here, Koobus.

369
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,056
Sir, I really think you must go to
a doctor, a hospital or something.

370
00:25:19,152 --> 00:25:21,517
-No, no. -You should
just get it checked out.

371
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:24,749
I'll just have it treated
by the medics. Help me up.

372
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:27,352
Did you see how fast
that prawn was, Trent?

373
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:30,393
-Yeah, he was fast.
-He was fast, I promise you.

374
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:41,242
Look, I fix it.
I make it work.

375
00:25:41,435 --> 00:25:44,315
I told you not to touch that.

376
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:46,812
What is wrong?

377
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:49,980
Nothing. Go outside
and watch for humans.

378
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,053
Where is your friend?

379
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:55,454
He's gone.

380
00:26:05,724 --> 00:26:08,247
Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm just a bit hot.

381
00:26:08,344 --> 00:26:11,224
Are you guys hot?
Are you hot, Trent? -No.

382
00:26:11,843 --> 00:26:15,069
Yeah, if you can't stand the heat
get out of the kitchen.

383
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:20,839
Now you see.
There's kids everywhere.

384
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:23,912
This is what I mean.
That's why we get rid of them.

385
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:26,313
-The little ones.
-Yeah, that's why we abort.

386
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:29,875
Lets just shoot the little bastard.
-No, no, don't shoot it now.

387
00:26:30,164 --> 00:26:32,467
MNU agents! Come out!

388
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:35,096
Hello, little guy.
MNU has sweets for you.

389
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,780
There you go, eat your sweety.

390
00:26:37,883 --> 00:26:40,945
You know, eaty sweety.
Works like a charm every time.

391
00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:43,538
Oh fuck, man!

392
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:46,995
You almost poked my eye out
with the fokkin' lollypop.

393
00:26:47,204 --> 00:26:49,729
I tried to be fokkin'
nice to you, man!

394
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:52,287
Is this your fokkin'
little brat here?

395
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:55,264
Inside, go!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

396
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,893
Teach him some manners.
Thomas, get him out.

397
00:26:58,031 --> 00:27:01,073
Come! Get down! I've had
enough of your stupid games.

398
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:03,592
What do you want?

399
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:06,088
We're from MNU.
-I know.

400
00:27:06,185 --> 00:27:09,065
We require your scrawl
on this eviction notification.

401
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:12,042
-Why am I being evicted?
-Yes, it's an eviction notice.

402
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:15,421
Put your scrawl on the bottom.
See? There's your name at the top.

403
00:27:15,518 --> 00:27:18,398
-Yes! -Christopher Johnson?
So, put your name in the bottom.

404
00:27:18,495 --> 00:27:20,799
It says you must
give me 24 hours notice.

405
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:23,936
You're going to another place. A nice
new city built especially for prawns.

406
00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:26,889
-A special place! -And we are not
even going to charge you, okay?

407
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:30,154
This isn't legal.
-Sign the fokkin' paper! -No!

408
00:27:32,075 --> 00:27:35,339
This guy is obviously...
he's a little sharper.

409
00:27:35,435 --> 00:27:38,315
So we are gonna
have to try something else.

410
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:40,664
All right. Hello... okay.

411
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,025
Seems like we didn't understand
each other there properly, eh?

412
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,396
So, you've got a little one there.

413
00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:48,988
Do you have a licence
for that little one? -Yes.

414
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:52,577
There's a litter out here. This is
dangerous conditions for your child.

415
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:55,776
Article 75 says that because
your child is living in dangerous

416
00:27:55,873 --> 00:27:58,561
conditions, I'm gonna take him
down to Child Services.

417
00:27:58,658 --> 00:28:00,770
I'm gonna go and have
a little chat with your son.

418
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:03,171
You keep away from my child!

419
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:06,315
Don't point your
fokkin' tentacles at me!

420
00:28:06,412 --> 00:28:08,332
You said you want to stay?

421
00:28:08,429 --> 00:28:11,117
Your boy is coming down with me
to Child Services.

422
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,132
He's gonna spend the rest
of his life in 1 by 1 meter box.

423
00:28:14,328 --> 00:28:17,807
Hello, little guy!
It's the sweety man coming!

424
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,744
Fuck, look at this, Trent!
Fuck it!

425
00:28:22,462 --> 00:28:25,590
Thomas, keep the gun on him.
He is definitely a criminal!

426
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:28,759
He's got a whole
computer shop here, man!

427
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:31,906
You know, this is amazing.
I mean, this is obviously...

428
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,435
you can see stolen computers now
that he's decorating his place with.

429
00:28:35,531 --> 00:28:38,251
Definitely he doesn't have
the permit for this.

430
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:41,228
Where is that fokkin' little brat?

431
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:45,455
Hello! It's the sweety man...

432
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:49,008
It's the sweety...
Hey, I've got this...

433
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:54,577
-Wikus!
-Trent, turn it off!

434
00:28:56,257 --> 00:28:59,609
Are you okay, boss?
-Fuck off, man! Fuck off!

435
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,261
Shall I leave him?
-Just fuckin' leave him, yeah.

436
00:29:15,758 --> 00:29:18,638
I'll see you tomorrow,
Christopher Johnson.

437
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:22,287
<i>When dealing with aliens,
try to be polite, but firm.</i>

438
00:29:22,384 --> 00:29:25,648
<i>And always remember that
a smile is cheaper than a bullet.</i>

439
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,702
Are you feeling better?
-What? -How are you feeling?

440
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:31,770
I'm fine, I'm alright.
I'm just a little bit dizzy.

441
00:29:32,194 --> 00:29:34,693
Can you just pull up
there on the side?

442
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:37,378
I just want to get
something to eat here.

443
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:44,875
Are you sure you should
be having that?

444
00:29:44,972 --> 00:29:47,084
After your whole puking episode?

445
00:29:47,184 --> 00:29:50,634
I feel a lot better... I think
I just needed the fillings, you know.

446
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,777
Boss! Boss!

447
00:29:54,455 --> 00:29:57,681
There's black stuff
coming out of your nose.

448
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:35,888
Jesus!

449
00:30:58,927 --> 00:31:02,575
It's a silver cylinder.
I can't find it.

450
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:06,992
We must find it.
It contains the fluid.

451
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:11,025
It's not here.

452
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:14,002
It has to be. Keep looking.

453
00:31:28,114 --> 00:31:31,186
We trade for ten thousand cans.

454
00:31:34,486 --> 00:31:36,954
Certain factions of nigerian gangs

455
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:39,451
want to try and extract
weaponry from District 9.

456
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:41,948
And have been trying to
for many many years.

457
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:45,719
Give them one hundred cans.
-Hundred. -One hundred!

458
00:31:45,816 --> 00:31:48,311
Yes, yes, but we take them all now.

459
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:51,864
Alright, boys!
Get them the catfood - hurry up.

460
00:31:53,449 --> 00:31:56,651
And they amassed
thousands of these weapons.

461
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,436
Without the ability to use them.

462
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:02,509
Fuck off! Go!
Hey friend, not you. You stay here.

463
00:32:02,702 --> 00:32:05,774
-What do you want from me?
-I just want to talk.

464
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,134
Talk about what?

465
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:11,918
Stupid prawn.
They'll believe anything.

466
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:14,779
Muti is a South African word.

467
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:18,167
Today it's synonymous
with witchdoctory and magic.

468
00:32:18,552 --> 00:32:21,624
You cut it here.
This is their heart.

469
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:25,177
Cures high blood
when you boil it,

470
00:32:25,274 --> 00:32:28,154
cures sugar, diabetes,
all diseases.

471
00:32:30,507 --> 00:32:33,774
The nigerians were consuming
alien body parts.

472
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,747
They believed that by doing so,
they were ingesting their power

473
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,628
to use alien weaponry.

474
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:43,347
You must eat them.

475
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:46,996
And their power will live in you.

476
00:32:51,646 --> 00:32:54,556
Just give me a fucking chance
to go in front of you, man!

477
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:06,636
Oh, baby! -Hi baby, come in!
-I need to get to the toilet, quickly!

478
00:33:06,733 --> 00:33:08,941
Why? What's the matter?

479
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:12,912
Baby, listen. I might have
crapped in my pants. -Surprise!

480
00:33:16,465 --> 00:33:20,304
What's this for? -Your promotion.
-All right, my promotion!

481
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:24,049
Hello, dad. How is it going?
Hi mom. -Good to see you.

482
00:33:24,146 --> 00:33:27,601
What a surprise, man!
-Congratulations. -Thanks.

483
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:30,482
Congratulations, boss.
-Thank you.

484
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:33,724
-Wikus, what happened?
-I had a small incident, baby.

485
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:37,085
I'm just gonna go to the toilet,
and then I'll talk to people, okay?

486
00:33:37,194 --> 00:33:39,945
I need to talk to you. Come with me.
-Okay, but I just gotta...

487
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:42,346
Guys, can you give us
a moment, please?

488
00:33:42,544 --> 00:33:44,713
What happened out there?

489
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:48,650
This prawn wouldn't listen to me,
one really unruly prawn...

490
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:52,023
and I just had to...
get him in my grasp.

491
00:33:52,216 --> 00:33:55,096
Listen to me, too many
aliens died out there today.

492
00:33:55,193 --> 00:33:57,593
UYO is all over my backside.

493
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,022
Focus! you're not going to
fuck this up for me!

494
00:34:01,154 --> 00:34:04,772
If you can't do the job,
I'll find someone who can!

495
00:34:07,653 --> 00:34:10,148
Hi there!
-Nice to see you again.

496
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:14,540
Does this mean he's in charge
of this new operation?

497
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:16,557
-Yes.
-That's nice.

498
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,918
Wikus! Baby are you okay?

499
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:32,687
Okay, let's cut some cake.

500
00:35:02,171 --> 00:35:05,854
<i>Doctor Smith, please come
to room 405, doctor Smith.</i>

501
00:35:11,494 --> 00:35:14,793
Is it badly infected?
-There's a lot of suppuration.

502
00:35:14,985 --> 00:35:18,794
Also you should know on my right hand
some fingernails were coming loose.

503
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:22,923
And I had a black fluid coming out
of my nose, and sort of a black vomit.

504
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,163
What is happening
to my arm, doctor?

505
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,372
What is this thing?

506
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:34,349
Just breathe deeply.
Calm down. Stay calm.

507
00:35:34,637 --> 00:35:37,517
Sir, please tell my wife.

508
00:35:41,937 --> 00:35:45,835
<i>Attention all medical containment
evacuate ward 11.</i>

509
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,193
Stop right there, madam.

510
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,170
What's going on?
What are you doing to him?

511
00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:13,435
Let me through!

512
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:17,852
Wikus! Wikus!
Where are you taking him?

513
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:37,082
Okay, got him?
Are you ready? -Got him.

514
00:36:41,595 --> 00:36:44,667
We decided not to
use the anesthetic,

515
00:36:44,764 --> 00:36:48,220
the reason being we can't know
how the subject will react.

516
00:37:00,507 --> 00:37:03,578
Doctor Fester! -Yes?
-I think you should see this.

517
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:07,707
I found it in his jacket.
You think this is alien?

518
00:37:16,347 --> 00:37:18,651
Stop, it's freezing! Fuck!

519
00:37:21,244 --> 00:37:24,124
16 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

520
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:27,101
Where is this?

521
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:32,499
What?

522
00:37:36,065 --> 00:37:39,161
What are they doing
to these prawns?

523
00:37:41,543 --> 00:37:44,488
Pain threshold, test one, DBX 7.

524
00:37:51,055 --> 00:37:55,281
That's a strong pain reaction.
That means the nerves have fused.

525
00:37:55,764 --> 00:37:58,834
I mean, it's almost
completely integrated.

526
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:01,143
Okay, do it.

527
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,216
B5. Testing AMR-B5.

528
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:09,878
Clear the range.
Now, quickly!

529
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,526
Swing it around.

530
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:16,928
What are you doing?
-The door is locked.

531
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:19,809
Can you grip that?
-What is this?

532
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:22,401
-Put it through.
-Why are you doing this?

533
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:26,191
-Standby for fire. Standby.
-You want me to shoot that?

534
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:29,267
Stand back... and fire!

535
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,104
That's good!

536
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,369
It worked!

537
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,892
All right, thanks very much.

538
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:42,101
Do you know where my wife is?

539
00:38:42,198 --> 00:38:45,078
Do you know if my wife
knows where I am, sir?

540
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,863
Pull! Pull!

541
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,968
No sir, I will not pull.

542
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:55,329
What did you say about
your wife? Fuck your wife!

543
00:38:55,522 --> 00:38:58,018
Pull! -I will not pull.

544
00:38:58,992 --> 00:39:00,782
Fire!

545
00:39:04,527 --> 00:39:08,174
B7. -I can pull it.
-He says he can pull it.

546
00:39:11,806 --> 00:39:14,168
I said I could pull it!
You fuckin'...!

547
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:18,969
B21.

548
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:24,264
Move, hurry up. Move!

549
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:27,337
Right, we want him in the center
by the chain. -Get this off me.

550
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:29,354
Come on! Time, time!

551
00:39:29,646 --> 00:39:33,392
Leave that fucking prawn, man,
I will shoot at pig. I'll shoot, sir!

552
00:39:33,522 --> 00:39:36,619
Listen, I'll shoot at pig again
for you. I'll pull the trigger.

553
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:40,076
But I'm not shooting at prawn,
you hear me? Untie the fucking gun.

554
00:39:40,173 --> 00:39:43,629
B21 in human hand.
That's good. It worked.

555
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,373
Just untie the gun, sir.
-Stand by.

556
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:51,098
Listen, you can't use the real guy,
he didn't do anything to you.

557
00:39:52,131 --> 00:39:55,226
I want to try this.
Everybody standing by.

558
00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:00,123
Ready to go?
Three, two, one, go!

559
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:06,984
Amazing!

560
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,045
All right!
I think that's all we need.

561
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:17,819
Gentlemen, we are
running out of time.

562
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,958
This is the key stage
in the metamorphosis.

563
00:40:21,054 --> 00:40:24,481
His DNA is in perfect balance
between alien and human.

564
00:40:24,577 --> 00:40:27,527
And a problem is,
as the infection spreads,

565
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:30,504
the transition becomes
permanent and less active.

566
00:40:30,604 --> 00:40:33,285
He's going to turn
into one of them. A prawn!

567
00:40:33,388 --> 00:40:35,364
What happens to him
isn't important.

568
00:40:35,461 --> 00:40:39,301
What's important is that we harvest
from him what we can right now.

569
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,801
This body represents
hundreds of millions,

570
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:46,192
maybe billions of dollars
worth of biotechnology.

571
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:49,624
There are people out there,
governments, corporations,

572
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:52,409
who'd kill for this chance.

573
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:56,023
Will he survive the procedure?
-No, of course not.

574
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,702
We need everything.
Tissue, bone marrow, blood.

575
00:40:59,973 --> 00:41:03,558
The procedure is gonna basically
strip him down to nothing. -Please...

576
00:41:03,655 --> 00:41:05,864
What about next of kin?

577
00:41:05,961 --> 00:41:08,649
Please help me.
Don't let them do it.

578
00:41:08,745 --> 00:41:11,049
I'll handle that.

579
00:41:12,046 --> 00:41:15,536
Okay, I say let's go.
-Good, thank you.

580
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,350
I don't understand.

581
00:41:28,543 --> 00:41:32,735
None of this makes any sense.
He just hurt his arm, dad.

582
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:38,076
The doctors are trying, sweetheart.

583
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,122
Doing their best to save him.

584
00:41:42,275 --> 00:41:45,155
We're starting to harvest
material from the specimen.

585
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:48,132
We'll start with the soft tissue first.
Cut through the chest cavern.

586
00:41:48,229 --> 00:41:50,917
We need to get the heart out
as quickly as possible.

587
00:41:51,187 --> 00:41:54,353
Once it set the sinuosity,
it just spread.

588
00:41:57,529 --> 00:42:01,175
You know Wikus.
He never was very strong.

589
00:42:03,071 --> 00:42:05,788
I'll go through the chest,
go straight into the heart.

590
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:08,036
Be quiet, please.
-Fuck you!

591
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:10,436
Can I see him?

592
00:42:12,552 --> 00:42:14,498
Not a good idea.

593
00:42:19,535 --> 00:42:21,737
Fuck off! Fuck you!

594
00:42:32,731 --> 00:42:34,741
Fuck you!

595
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,502
Drop the knife!

596
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,479
Move or I'll fuckin' cut his throat!

597
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:45,687
Okay. All right!

598
00:42:48,184 --> 00:42:50,488
I'll fuckin' kill him!

599
00:42:59,156 --> 00:43:02,036
You need to let go of him now.

600
00:43:05,018 --> 00:43:08,859
It's okay, Tania.
Everything will be okay.

601
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:19,035
Smith.

602
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:23,041
When?

603
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:27,494
Get Koobus.

604
00:44:02,622 --> 00:44:04,734
<i>...Wikus Van De Merwe.</i>

605
00:44:04,831 --> 00:44:08,287
<i>White male, mid thirties.
Is considered highly dangerous.</i>

606
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,456
-Hey baby.
-Wikus, is that you?

607
00:44:11,674 --> 00:44:13,876
-Mrs. Smith?
-How dare you phone us!

608
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:16,919
What are all these people doing in
my house? -It's none of your business.

609
00:44:17,016 --> 00:44:19,965
I need to speak to Tania
straight away, please. It's my house.

610
00:44:20,062 --> 00:44:23,134
This is my phone that you're
using, mam. I'm fokkin'... what?

611
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:25,569
He tried calling me.

612
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,545
Anton, it's me! It's me!
Accept the call!

613
00:44:28,642 --> 00:44:32,289
I've been friends with you
for fokkin' 13 years, man!

614
00:44:32,386 --> 00:44:35,074
Fuck off! What are you watching?
Fuck off!

615
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,160
We all thought it was for the best
because he needed help.

616
00:44:38,257 --> 00:44:40,177
A special medical help.

617
00:44:40,274 --> 00:44:42,962
And he wasn't gonna
get that as a fugitive.

618
00:44:48,413 --> 00:44:52,311
He became the most valuable
business artifact on Earth.

619
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:57,317
He was the only human
who had ever...

620
00:44:57,509 --> 00:45:01,443
successfully been combined with
alien genetics and remained alive.

621
00:45:01,672 --> 00:45:05,509
But his real value was that
he could operate alien weaponry.

622
00:45:13,237 --> 00:45:14,867
Hello.

623
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:18,612
Can I get some cheese burgers
and one large sauerkraut, please.

624
00:45:18,746 --> 00:45:21,372
<i>We interrupt this program

625

<i>A patient has escaped from the

626
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:28,101
<i>Wikus Van De Merwe

627
00:45:28,197 --> 00:45:31,461
<i>after prolonged sexual activity

628
00:45:31,654 --> 00:45:34,822
This is nonsense.
-I have to call my manager.

629
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:37,377
That is totally untrue.
You are legally obliged to serve me!

630
00:45:37,474 --> 00:45:39,394
<i>...is causing bodily disfigurement.</i>

631
00:45:39,491 --> 00:45:42,371

please. Don't listen to them!

<i>It's highly contagious

away from this man.</i>

634
00:45:47,726 --> 00:45:49,646
Don't look at this hand!
This hand is fine!

635
00:45:49,752 --> 00:45:52,442
<i>If you have any information

637
00:45:56,284 --> 00:45:58,012
Stop!

00:45:58,973 --> 00:46:01,853
31 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

639
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,827
Hi, this is Tania.
-And Wikus.

640
00:46:10,924 --> 00:46:13,420
We can't come
to the phone right now.

641
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:16,781
Please leave a message. Bye.
-Bye bye.

642
00:46:28,974 --> 00:46:32,046
<i>Control, there's no sign
of mr Van De Merwe.</i>

643
00:46:57,624 --> 00:47:00,920
The entire world was watching him.

644
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:05,471
He was on every radio station,
every image on television,

645
00:47:05,664 --> 00:47:08,544
anything you could find
had his face on it.

646
00:47:08,645 --> 00:47:12,520
So he had nowhere else to go.
He ended up hiding in the one place

647
00:47:12,617 --> 00:47:16,164
he knew no one would ever
come looking for him.

648

00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:38,334
I pay you next week, I promise.

651
00:48:38,527 --> 00:48:42,367
No money - you get nothing.
Fucking prawn, this isn't charity.

652
00:48:45,246 --> 00:48:48,379
Hello, I'd like to buy
some meat, please.

653
00:48:48,572 --> 00:48:50,492
Hey, a man!

654
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:54,440
Yes, have you got a hamburger,
or a steak roll?

655
00:48:54,728 --> 00:48:57,065
Does it look like
a hamburger shop?

656
00:48:57,161 --> 00:48:59,405
Which one do you want? Goat?

657
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:02,221
Come on, come on,
I don't have the whole day.

658
00:49:02,738 --> 00:49:05,620
Is that a cat food there?
-Yeah, yeah, it is.

659
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:08,110
I'll have some of that, guys.

660
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:30,381
Fuck, man!

661
00:49:49,595 --> 00:49:52,128
Hello, hello?

662
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:57,975
Baby is that you? Tania?

663
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,188
God, please let it be you.

664
00:50:01,477 --> 00:50:03,589
Yes, it's me.

665
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:07,370
I'm so happy you called me, baby.

666
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:10,825
Wikus, listen to me. -Okay.

667
00:50:11,889 --> 00:50:15,407
I have something to say to you,
and it's not gonna be easy.

668
00:50:15,668 --> 00:50:18,616
No, no, look... listen baby,
before you say anything...

669
00:50:18,712 --> 00:50:22,363
Your father is working against me,
but he's lying to you.

670
00:50:22,747 --> 00:50:25,524
I did not have sex
with one of these...

671
00:50:25,717 --> 00:50:27,829
...fokkin' creatures, man!

672
00:50:27,968 --> 00:50:30,175
I would never have any kind of

673
00:50:30,272 --> 00:50:33,055
pornographic activity
with a fokkin' creature!

674
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:38,272
They say that you're becoming
one of them. I can't do this...

675
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,314
Baby please, don't give up on me.

676
00:50:41,613 --> 00:50:44,622
Don't give up on me baby,
because I can...

677
00:50:44,911 --> 00:50:47,441
I want to see you again, baby.

678
00:50:47,603 --> 00:50:50,424
I'm gonna fix my arm
and I'm gonna see you again,

679
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,365
and I'm gonna kiss you
and I'm gonna hold you again.

680
00:50:53,462 --> 00:50:56,534
I also want you
to hold me again.

681
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,635
Baby?

682
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:04,217
Baby?

683
00:51:17,168 --> 00:51:19,469
Hey! Hey man!

684
00:51:39,053 --> 00:51:40,973
Okay...

685
00:52:04,493 --> 00:52:07,757
<i>We are on tracking
directly to the location.</i>

686
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:11,214
<i>Roger that. I'll send you a
couple of choppers for backup.</i>

687
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:31,739
You!

688
00:52:31,932 --> 00:52:34,428
What do you want?

689
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:41,212
<i>Come in, control, there is
our target moving to 66.</i>

690
00:52:41,405 --> 00:52:44,861
-You have to go.
-Please, I need your help.

691
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,955
We're gonna play hide and seek.
-Yes! Yes! -No, get back.

692
00:52:50,051 --> 00:52:53,315
You want me to hide? Show me
your favorite hiding place.

693
00:52:53,508 --> 00:52:57,348
Please, just go.
Leave us alone.

694
00:52:57,936 --> 00:53:00,749
No, please, I need to hide.

695
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:03,637
They wanna kill me.

696
00:53:03,733 --> 00:53:07,415
I just need to hide in here,
sir, for 5 minutes, okay?

697
00:53:17,442 --> 00:53:20,323
What is this?
What are you doing here?

698
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,300
I remember you. -Nothing.
You must hide somewhere else.

699
00:53:23,397 --> 00:53:25,734
Sir... please sir,
you have to help me.

700
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:28,519
I'm losing blood,
they're trying to kill me.

701
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,247
Only one thing that could
make that happen...

702
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:46,567
Quick! We have to hide him.

703
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,848
Now you... get down there.

704
00:54:04,273 --> 00:54:07,345
Where's the fluid?
What did you do with it?

705
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:09,328
-Please!
-You took it...

706
00:54:09,425 --> 00:54:11,344
I don't know what
you're talking about!

707
00:54:11,441 --> 00:54:15,089
...I know you did.
I can see what's happening to you.

708
00:54:15,282 --> 00:54:17,778
Tell me where it is.

709
00:54:19,133 --> 00:54:21,246
Alright, alright.

710
00:54:21,534 --> 00:54:24,636
Was it a black fluid
in a flask container?

711
00:54:24,733 --> 00:54:27,037
Yes, that's it. Yes!

712
00:54:27,396 --> 00:54:30,629
I confiscated it and
the guys at the lab took it.

713
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,606
It will be at the MNU.
MNU has it.

714
00:54:42,899 --> 00:54:45,034
What is this?

715
00:54:45,131 --> 00:54:48,395
-You ruined everything.
-Where is this?

716
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:54,582
Is that your shack?

717
00:54:54,783 --> 00:54:57,623
This whole thing
is under your shack?

718
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:01,150
For 20 years you've...
had this fokking' thing in here?

719
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:04,775
Jesus, this is very illegal.

720
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:09,417
I mean, this is a find, you know.
I wish they catch you with this.

721
00:55:12,394 --> 00:55:14,602
Fuel goes in here.

722
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:17,099
That's enough! Quiet!

723
00:55:17,196 --> 00:55:19,308
Then we fly away.

724
00:55:19,405 --> 00:55:21,709
I said quiet!
We cannot trust him.

725
00:55:21,881 --> 00:55:25,692
What is he saying about the fuel?
Are you trying to start this thing?

726
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:28,926
Are you little fuckers trying
to start this and get away?

727
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,943
Never mind.

728
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:33,279
Yeah, you sneaky fokkin' prawns.

729
00:55:33,376 --> 00:55:36,064
Too bad. I could've fixed you.

730
00:55:36,198 --> 00:55:39,881
What? What did you say...
about the fixing?

731
00:55:40,073 --> 00:55:42,342
What do you mean
you could fix me?

732
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:45,319
Forget it.
It doesn't matter, it's too late.

733
00:55:45,582 --> 00:55:48,495
No, listen! Listen.
Are you saying that you can...

734
00:55:48,592 --> 00:55:51,125
turn this prawn hand
into a human hand?

735
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,419
You can make me human again?

736
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:57,452
We have medical machines on the
mothership that can fix you. Yes.

737
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:01,005
We can use this ship
to fly up there.

738
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,064
That's fantastic!
You guys are brilliant!

739
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,131
I always thought that prawns
were intelligent. Let's do it.

740
00:56:07,515 --> 00:56:09,627
I don't have fluid.

741
00:56:09,916 --> 00:56:14,140
I could fix you and I could fly away.
But I don't have fluid.

742
00:56:14,473 --> 00:56:16,428
Right, okay.

743
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,925
All right, I tell you what.
Why don't we...

744
00:56:19,021 --> 00:56:21,901
go risk it some more?
Let's go collect some up.

745
00:56:22,094 --> 00:56:25,742
It took twenty years
to collect that amount.

746
00:56:26,358 --> 00:56:28,792
Fuck, man! Fuck!

747
00:56:29,112 --> 00:56:32,594
Fuck! The only one that exists
is the one I confiscated?

748
00:56:32,691 --> 00:56:34,419
Yes.

749
00:56:34,589 --> 00:56:37,365
It's four stories underground.

750
00:56:43,174 --> 00:56:46,851
Why does he keep looking at me
like that? -He likes you.

751
00:56:47,044 --> 00:56:49,156
We are the same.

752
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:54,024
We're not the same.
We're not the fokkin' same.

753
00:57:00,744 --> 00:57:05,928
There is a way out of this.
We get the fluid back from MNU.

754
00:57:07,805 --> 00:57:10,560
Yeah, and what then?
Then we both die, eh?

755
00:57:10,689 --> 00:57:13,475
Both of us dead.
That's a suicide mission, man.

756
00:57:13,571 --> 00:57:16,867
Can you not fill my head
with that sort of nonsense?

757
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:20,900
The transformation is accelerating.

758
00:57:23,013 --> 00:57:25,893
You don't have much time.

759
00:57:49,413 --> 00:57:52,292
56 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

760
00:58:14,948 --> 00:58:17,444
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

761
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:42,099
Hello.

762
00:58:42,196 --> 00:58:45,076
-Wikus?
-Tania! Baby...

763
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:48,116
-Are you okay?
-Oh God! Thank God...

764
00:58:48,764 --> 00:58:51,064
Where are you?

765
00:58:51,257 --> 00:58:53,177
I'am...

766
00:58:54,562 --> 00:58:58,949
It's not like my father said.
I know he was lying to protect me.

767
00:59:00,936 --> 00:59:03,787
I just don't know
what to believe anymore.

768
00:59:03,883 --> 00:59:06,189
Baby I know, but listen to me.

769
00:59:06,285 --> 00:59:10,347
It's all lies, I swear to you.
Everything he said to you is lies.

770
00:59:11,218 --> 00:59:14,288
-I know.
-What? What?

771
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:18,200
I believe you, Wikus.
I just want you back.

772
00:59:18,394 --> 00:59:21,148
I want everything back
the way it was.

773
00:59:21,341 --> 00:59:24,158
That's... baby, that's what I want.

774
00:59:24,255 --> 00:59:26,942
That's great!
That's great news.

775
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,111
I can make it the way it was.
If you take me back.

776
00:59:31,045 --> 00:59:34,371
How? How can we go back?

777
00:59:38,028 --> 00:59:41,039
I have a plan.
I know how to fix it.

778
00:59:41,135 --> 00:59:43,504
I know how to fix myself.

779
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,516
And it will be me.
And we'll be back together.

780
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:49,973
-You promise me?
-I promise you, baby.

781
00:59:50,808 --> 00:59:53,274
Don't give up on me, okay?

782
00:59:53,371 --> 00:59:56,510
Because I haven't
given up on you. All right?

783
00:59:56,702 --> 00:59:58,722
I won't.

784
00:59:58,819 --> 01:00:01,891
-I love you.
-I love you too.

785
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:07,172
Tell me you got a fix on him.
-D9.

786
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:17,071
How many moons
does our planet have?

787
01:00:21,391 --> 01:00:23,464
Seven.

788
01:00:24,904 --> 01:00:27,794
This planet only has one.

789
01:00:28,437 --> 01:00:32,498
I can't wait to see our planet.
It's bigger than this one, isn't it?

790
01:00:32,642 --> 01:00:34,720
Enough.

791
01:00:35,522 --> 01:00:37,835
We go home now?

792
01:00:38,229 --> 01:00:41,588
Not home. No.

793
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,658
This is where we must go.

794
01:00:46,877 --> 01:00:50,516
See that tent there?
That might be ours.

795
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:53,837
I want to go home!

796
01:00:55,028 --> 01:01:00,653
We can't go home.
Not anymore.

797
01:01:05,984 --> 01:01:09,793
Hi, you don't wanna go to the tents,
they are not better.

798
01:01:09,892 --> 01:01:12,101
They're smaller than the shacks.

799
01:01:12,197 --> 01:01:14,919
Actually, more like
a concentration camp.

800
01:01:15,015 --> 01:01:18,945
If I can get you that black fluid,
what happens then?

801
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:21,730
We go up to the mothership.

802
01:01:21,934 --> 01:01:24,839
And you can start that thing?
-Yes.

803
01:01:25,779 --> 01:01:29,492
Okay, so just to be clear:
this is gonna go back...

804
01:01:32,281 --> 01:01:35,804
This is gonna go back
to human like this.

805
01:01:36,284 --> 01:01:39,391
I can go home
and then you can go home.

806
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:42,241
You can take your boy,
you can take all the prawns,

807
01:01:42,337 --> 01:01:44,639
if I can get you that fluid, right?

808
01:01:44,736 --> 01:01:49,344
You said it was a suicide mission.
Maybe you were right.

809
01:01:50,113 --> 01:01:53,761
We have no weapons.
They'll shoot us on sight.

810
01:01:55,471 --> 01:01:58,031
Look, look... Christopher...

811
01:01:58,223 --> 01:02:01,128
I know where we can get weapons.

812
01:02:08,764 --> 01:02:11,062
Hi guys. Hello.

813
01:02:12,927 --> 01:02:16,028
I would like to buy
some weapons, please.

814
01:02:16,931 --> 01:02:20,003
How did you do this like that?

815
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:23,197
A doggie style with the demon.

816
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:25,356
I love it!

817
01:02:25,452 --> 01:02:28,965
One brave white man, eh?
Were you wearing a condom?

818
01:02:29,905 --> 01:02:32,778
I need to buy weapons, please.

819
01:02:33,396 --> 01:02:37,238
You and I both know that there
are illegal weapons inside here.

820
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:40,719
I have money and I would like
to buy some of those...

821
01:02:48,976 --> 01:02:50,704
Sit!

822
01:03:03,983 --> 01:03:07,985
Thank you sir for your time.
Thank you very much for seeing me.

823
01:03:09,237 --> 01:03:12,182
I would like to buy some weapons.

824
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:16,022
AK-47, some grenades...
maybe tear gas canisters.

825
01:03:16,282 --> 01:03:19,261
I see you have limpet mines
here aswell, and I..

826
01:03:19,357 --> 01:03:23,265
also see you guys have alien
weapons there, which is great!

827
01:03:23,361 --> 01:03:26,116
If I could have one or two of those.

828
01:03:26,213 --> 01:03:29,318
I have money, okay?
Now, I'm...

829
01:03:33,934 --> 01:03:36,238
Sir! Please, sir!

830
01:03:36,527 --> 01:03:38,576
I've heard about you.

831
01:03:38,673 --> 01:03:41,553
Where do you have it?
Show me!

832
01:03:41,747 --> 01:03:43,540
Oh, shit!

833
01:03:44,213 --> 01:03:46,445
Come here. Come.

834
01:03:52,221 --> 01:03:54,742
No, no... don't please!

835
01:03:59,159 --> 01:04:02,039
Why are you doing this?
What do you want?

836
01:04:03,431 --> 01:04:05,378
Shut up!

837
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,183
Forget the weapons!
Forget the weapons!

838
01:04:11,568 --> 01:04:14,256
I want the arm. Cut it off.

839
01:04:15,025 --> 01:04:17,521
What is he saying?

840
01:04:27,813 --> 01:04:29,924
I'll show you.

841
01:04:33,477 --> 01:04:35,578
Holy shit!

842
01:04:39,818 --> 01:04:42,306
You tell them to stand down!

843
01:04:47,058 --> 01:04:50,163
You tell them to be quiet!
To back off!

844
01:04:52,247 --> 01:04:55,477
Tell them to put the fokkin'
weapons in the bag!

845
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:58,261
Give me the fokkin' weapons, man!

846
01:04:59,221 --> 01:05:01,717
Don't you, sir, look at me.

847
01:05:01,921 --> 01:05:04,930
I said don't fokkin' look at me!

848
01:05:09,638 --> 01:05:12,326
How did you get that hand?

849
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:15,079
Fokkin' hurry up there!

850
01:05:15,176 --> 01:05:18,248
Look at me when I fuckin' speak
to you. What is your secret?

851
01:05:18,345 --> 01:05:21,033
What did you do? Tell me!

852
01:05:21,873 --> 01:05:25,424
I want that fuckin' arm.
What the fuck did you do?

853
01:05:25,524 --> 01:05:28,051
You fuckin' mazungo,
I'm coming for you!

854
01:05:28,148 --> 01:05:30,644
I'm coming for you and
I'm gonna get you!

855
01:05:31,324 --> 01:05:34,365
Drop your fokkin' knife.
Drop your fokkin' knife!

856
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:45,885
He's useless to us dead.
-Would you relax?

857
01:05:46,784 --> 01:05:50,241
For fuck's sakes, my men have
done this a hundred times before.

858
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,601
<i>Maintaining a visual
on the location.</i>

859
01:05:56,008 --> 01:05:57,962
It's gonna be quick.

860
01:05:58,058 --> 01:06:00,131
It's gonna be clean.

861
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:04,237
Best of all,
it's gonna be quiet.

862
01:06:05,233 --> 01:06:08,584
Van De Merwe hasn't got a clue
what's coming his way.

863
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,768
It's empty!
-Where are they?

864
01:06:15,131 --> 01:06:17,747
Target is gone.
The place is empty.

865
01:06:17,844 --> 01:06:20,532
What do you mean, empty?
Where the fuck is he?

866
01:06:20,832 --> 01:06:24,099
That little shithead has got
no idea what is coming his way.

867
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:26,561
I'm gonna find him.

868
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:38,799
There are the guards! At the gate!
Watch the guards at the gate, man!

869
01:06:45,438 --> 01:06:47,550
Move! Get out!

870
01:06:52,735 --> 01:06:55,425
They're going down.
Four stories down.

871
01:06:55,522 --> 01:06:58,402
This is alien weaponry.
Give me a status report.

872
01:06:59,651 --> 01:07:01,954
It's Van De Merwe.
He's on level four.

873
01:07:02,055 --> 01:07:04,609
Switch to live, and
then we're taking him out.

874
01:07:04,714 --> 01:07:07,596
Colonel, we weren't allowed
to use live ammunition.

875
01:07:07,692 --> 01:07:10,250
They want him alive.

876
01:07:13,683 --> 01:07:16,629
Stay here until I call you.
-I understand.

877
01:07:16,726 --> 01:07:19,500
I need to get the door open.

878
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:23,149
No! I said stay until I call you!

879
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:30,638
Fuck!

880
01:07:31,503 --> 01:07:34,191
I thought you said
not to kill them?

881
01:07:34,576 --> 01:07:36,880
He shot at me!

882
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:41,004
Fuck! Get out!
Don't fuckin' look at me!

883
01:07:41,101 --> 01:07:43,597
Get out!
Get the fuck out!

884
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:59,388
Get out!
Everybody get the fuck out!

885
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:02,209
Get out! Go!

886
01:08:02,594 --> 01:08:05,090
Move the fuck out! Go!

887
01:08:06,146 --> 01:08:09,218
What is this place?
-Don't worry about that.

888
01:08:09,603 --> 01:08:12,483
What do they do in here?

889
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:16,175
Check these boxes.

890
01:08:16,272 --> 01:08:19,792
Any type of a box that looks like
it can hold a tube. Just check it out!

891
01:08:20,114 --> 01:08:22,225
These fuckers!

892
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:27,121
Go, go, go...

893
01:08:28,946 --> 01:08:30,866
Clear.

894
01:08:36,819 --> 01:08:39,123
I got it! I got it!

895
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:44,937
Chris, I got it. Let's go!

896
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:48,163
Christopher!

897
01:08:50,928 --> 01:08:52,913
Oh, fuck!

898
01:08:53,105 --> 01:08:56,563
Listen... I promise you,
I didn't know they were doing this.

899
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:59,479
Until they brought me here
the other day,

900
01:08:59,575 --> 01:09:02,618
I swear to you I did not know
they were doing this to you guys.

901
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,563
But Christopher...
look at me. Listen to me.

902
01:09:05,692 --> 01:09:08,351
We need to leave now. Okay?

903
01:09:08,447 --> 01:09:11,106
The whole of MNU
is gonna come down here.

904
01:09:11,202 --> 01:09:13,756
He's going to destroy us.

905
01:09:15,304 --> 01:09:18,249
We can do this, okay?
We're gonna get out of here...

906
01:09:18,633 --> 01:09:20,255
Fire!

907
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,040
Move, move!

908
01:09:24,481 --> 01:09:26,977
Shoot at the prawn!

909
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:38,775
Christopher!
What the fuck are you doing?

910
01:09:46,072 --> 01:09:48,952
Think of your boy,
for fuck sake!

911
01:09:57,264 --> 01:10:01,103
What the hell are you doing?
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

912
01:10:03,284 --> 01:10:06,735
You're gonna get us killed!
-What do we do now?

913
01:10:09,466 --> 01:10:12,051
I thought you had a way out?

914
01:10:12,157 --> 01:10:14,462
I didn't say anything
about the way out.

915
01:10:14,558 --> 01:10:17,686
I promised you that we'll get in.
We're in! -I have an idea.

916
01:10:17,783 --> 01:10:20,663
-Where are you going?
-Follow me!

917
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:28,137
What are you doing?
-Making a bomb.

918
01:10:28,329 --> 01:10:30,249
Let's go!

919
01:10:42,153 --> 01:10:44,649
Quick! Get in!

920
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:47,530
Go! Drive!

921
01:10:48,299 --> 01:10:50,026
Okay!

922
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:53,962
Okay, hold on!

923
01:10:55,019 --> 01:10:56,747
Fuck!

924
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:05,639
Reports are coming in of explosion
in downtown Johannesburg.

925
01:11:05,832 --> 01:11:08,136
Well, there was a terrorist attack,

926
01:11:08,233 --> 01:11:11,497
but I can assure you that we
dealt with it. Everything is fine.

927
01:11:13,898 --> 01:11:16,970
Droop it down!
Droop it down! Decline!

928
01:11:25,186 --> 01:11:27,872
They are really
close to us now!

929
01:11:31,137 --> 01:11:32,865
Shit!

930
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,365
Let's go, let's go!

931
01:11:40,913 --> 01:11:43,565
Don't drop that fokkin' thing!

932
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,077
Come on, move!
Get down there!

933
01:11:54,174 --> 01:11:57,438
Go down and initiate
the binary commands.

934
01:11:59,652 --> 01:12:02,022
Set it down right now!

935
01:12:02,246 --> 01:12:05,183
When we get up to the mothership,
how long is this gonna take?

936
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,776
-To do what?
-The fixing. To fix me.

937
01:12:07,873 --> 01:12:10,561
It's going to take a bit
longer than I thought.

938
01:12:10,663 --> 01:12:12,772
Okay, that's fine.
How long do you need?

939
01:12:12,869 --> 01:12:14,981
Three years.

940
01:12:15,345 --> 01:12:17,812
Sorry, just go slowly
with the clicks there,

941
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:21,112
it sounded like you said
"three years", like human years.

942
01:12:21,304 --> 01:12:23,834
Yes. Three years.

943
01:12:24,347 --> 01:12:26,738
What? Three fuckin' years?

944
01:12:26,835 --> 01:12:29,523
I will fix you,

945
01:12:29,716 --> 01:12:32,692
but first I must save my people.

946
01:12:33,059 --> 01:12:36,068
The deal was:
you go home, I get fixed!

947
01:12:36,165 --> 01:12:39,813
I will not let my people
be medical experiments!

948
01:12:40,202 --> 01:12:42,891
I'm a fokkin' medical experiment!
You hear me, Christopher?

949
01:12:42,988 --> 01:12:45,388
I'm a fokkin' medical
experiment, man!

950
01:12:45,485 --> 01:12:48,173
I must go home and get help.

951
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:51,341
I must use all the fluid
to travel quickly.

952
01:12:52,437 --> 01:12:56,280
I'll just stay here, Christopher?
I'll just stay here in this shack.

953
01:12:56,665 --> 01:13:00,177
And I'll see you in three years time?
-I will come back. I promise.

954
01:13:00,348 --> 01:13:02,195
Christopher!

955
01:13:23,314 --> 01:13:25,618
Where the fuck is he?

956
01:13:26,387 --> 01:13:30,034
Hey, you're hiding Wikus
down there, my boy?

957
01:13:31,091 --> 01:13:33,587
-Father?
-No, no, no.

958
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:37,524
Your daddy needs to stay here
to sort out a few things, alright?

959
01:13:37,823 --> 01:13:41,471
We're gonna go. We're gonna
come back and fetch him, okay?

960
01:13:44,776 --> 01:13:47,496
In here? -In there.
-Goes in here?

961
01:13:47,914 --> 01:13:50,759
How the fuck do you
open this, prawn?

962
01:13:53,393 --> 01:13:55,121
Father.

963
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,218
Show me, you fucker.
You want me to fuckin' kill you?

964
01:13:59,411 --> 01:14:02,291
Is that what you fuckin' want, eh?

965
01:14:17,739 --> 01:14:20,235
Right... there's no buttons.

966
01:14:20,524 --> 01:14:22,060
On!

967
01:14:22,445 --> 01:14:24,173
Activate?

968
01:14:24,365 --> 01:14:26,735
My teachers teach only:

969
01:14:26,831 --> 01:14:29,259
One prawn, one bullet.

970
01:14:34,454 --> 01:14:37,426
I can't believe
I get paid to do this.

971
01:14:38,586 --> 01:14:41,496
I love watching you prawns die.

972
01:14:44,089 --> 01:14:46,009
Fuck, man!

973
01:14:54,862 --> 01:14:56,782
Father!

974
01:15:00,815 --> 01:15:02,734
Get out! Get out!

975
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,546
This is remarkable.

976
01:15:11,643 --> 01:15:14,523
It looks like something is
emerging from the ground.

977
01:15:14,629 --> 01:15:17,554
Something is definitely
coming out of the ground.

978
01:15:17,939 --> 01:15:19,859
Okay... steady!

979
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,642
Go sit down,
I can't play with ya now.

980
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:32,395
Uncle Wikus is flying.

981
01:15:33,231 --> 01:15:35,695
Bug off. Bug off!

982
01:15:41,623 --> 01:15:44,311
Lock the weapon at target!

983
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:46,968
Fire when locked.

984
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:52,508
It seems to be drifting towards
the center of the territory.

985
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:55,227
We have a lock on him. -Fire!

986
01:15:55,876 --> 01:15:59,067
Something is fired upon...
it has been hit!

987
01:15:59,559 --> 01:16:01,480
What the fuck is that?

988
01:16:01,576 --> 01:16:04,268
One of the engines is billowing
smoke, it's out of control.

989
01:16:04,556 --> 01:16:08,041
It's going down, boss. Should I
send the boys to fuck him up?

990
01:16:11,795 --> 01:16:15,059
Now... it hit the ground,
the massive impact,

991
01:16:15,156 --> 01:16:18,036
and it's come to a standstill.

992
01:16:22,944 --> 01:16:25,824
My son!
My son's in there!

993
01:16:26,017 --> 01:16:28,770
Shut the fuck up!
Get this fucker inside.

994
01:16:28,868 --> 01:16:32,028
We're moving out.
Come, let's go, let's go...

995
01:16:32,774 --> 01:16:34,339
Move!

996
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:38,059
We're banking around now, trying
to get a better view of the ship

997
01:16:38,156 --> 01:16:41,804
which is absolutely wrecked,
waiting for some of the smoke to clear.

998
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:44,653
Somebody has been
brought out of the vehicle.

999
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,861
It looks like a human being.

1000
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:49,616
We are getting unconfirmed
reports that this might be

1001
01:17:49,713 --> 01:17:52,500
Wikus Van De Merwe, a fugitive
that has been on the run

1002
01:17:52,597 --> 01:17:54,901
from MNU for the past 3 days.

1003
01:17:54,998 --> 01:17:58,605
They are loading him into
a vehicle now, and heading off.

1004
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:04,270
72 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

1005
01:18:24,597 --> 01:18:26,926
What the fuck?

1006
01:18:39,135 --> 01:18:42,423
We caught him, boss.
-Bring him to me.

1007
01:18:58,385 --> 01:19:00,585
Come on! Get back!

1008
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:03,852
Oh, fuck!

1009
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:13,464
Control, we're taking enemy fire!
We need support. Backup, now!

1010
01:19:18,532 --> 01:19:20,957
Fuck off! Fuck off, man!

1011
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:33,822
Get you hands off me!
Fuckin' get off me!

1012
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:39,967
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

1013
01:20:15,387 --> 01:20:18,653
Didn't I tell you...
that I'm gonna get you?

1014
01:20:18,973 --> 01:20:22,654
You came in here and you left
with something that belongs to me.

1015
01:20:24,035 --> 01:20:26,111
Fuck you.

1016
01:20:33,164 --> 01:20:35,595
Fuck you all!

1017
01:21:13,395 --> 01:21:16,277
I told you that
the day will come.

1018
01:21:16,949 --> 01:21:20,087
You've been running
around with my prize.

1019
01:21:20,633 --> 01:21:24,123
All I want is to eat that hand
and become like you.

1020
01:21:24,541 --> 01:21:26,902
No! It won't work...

1021
01:21:30,434 --> 01:21:33,734
Once I have that power,
no one will stop me.

1022
01:21:34,023 --> 01:21:37,286
It was your turn...
now it's mine!

1023
01:21:40,267 --> 01:21:43,726
Fighting MNU security forces,
this armed faction is doomed...

1024
01:21:48,471 --> 01:21:51,954
Now I'm gonna eat, my friend.

1025
01:23:11,632 --> 01:23:15,663
We're getting reports claiming that
the alien device is activating...

1026
01:24:12,958 --> 01:24:16,512
You see that prawn
back in the Casper? -Yeah.

1027
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:19,715
He knows what the fuck
is up with that ship.

1028
01:24:19,811 --> 01:24:23,326
Get that fucker out
and get him talking, now.

1029
01:24:34,579 --> 01:24:38,291
Three contractors are closing in
on the nigerian compound, and...

1030
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:42,997
Come, alien!

1031
01:24:53,028 --> 01:24:55,521
What's your plan?

1032
01:25:17,883 --> 01:25:20,348
How are you doing it?

1033
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:22,971
Who's moving that ship?

1034
01:25:24,412 --> 01:25:26,716
All right, that's very clever.

1035
01:25:31,753 --> 01:25:35,530
Wait for my command.
Make sure you fuckin' shoot to kill.

1036
01:25:42,325 --> 01:25:44,629
Fuck! Move it! Move it!

1037
01:25:46,166 --> 01:25:48,692
Bring that fucker down!

1038
01:25:55,139 --> 01:25:58,499
Hold you fire! Hold your fire
and keep your positions!

1039
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:01,017
It's Van De Merwe.

1040
01:26:01,498 --> 01:26:03,610
Hey, Dickus!

1041
01:26:17,236 --> 01:26:20,118
I'll come back for prawn,
alright guys?

1042
01:26:20,215 --> 01:26:22,327
Do you hear me, now?
-Run, Wikus!

1043
01:26:22,424 --> 01:26:24,573
-You hear me?
-Run!

1044
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:27,358
And keep on running,
you fuckin' coward!

1045
01:26:27,455 --> 01:26:29,533
Run! Run!

1046
01:26:31,874 --> 01:26:35,555
Get the air support up,
and get on his fuckin' trail, now!

1047
01:26:38,408 --> 01:26:41,705
It's not gonna work, boss.
He's a tough one.

1048
01:26:41,868 --> 01:26:45,158
He's not gonna talk.
-Then just fuckin' kill him.

1049
01:26:59,079 --> 01:27:01,767
<i>He's not gonna talk.
-Then just fuckin' kill him.</i>

1050
01:27:01,864 --> 01:27:03,400
Fuck!

1051
01:27:03,496 --> 01:27:05,895
<i>He's a tough one.
He's not gonna talk.</i>

1052
01:27:05,992 --> 01:27:08,104
<i>Then just fuckin' kill him.</i>

1053
01:27:30,195 --> 01:27:33,555
Hey, c'mon. Get up!
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1054
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:37,107
-I can't... it's too far.
-It's not too fokkin' far. Get up!

1055
01:27:37,492 --> 01:27:40,755
I'm gonna get you there.
I'm gonna get you to your boy!

1056
01:27:40,852 --> 01:27:43,251
C'mon, stay behind me!

1057
01:27:53,715 --> 01:27:55,826
Go back!

1058
01:27:59,378 --> 01:28:01,298
Run, run, run!

1059
01:28:06,002 --> 01:28:09,650
Arriving at the location now.
We have a clearance to engage.

1060
01:28:10,226 --> 01:28:13,106
Prawns are coming,
get down, get down!

1061
01:28:28,081 --> 01:28:31,537
There are headed for a drop site.
Knock these fuckers off!

1062
01:28:34,032 --> 01:28:36,144
Come to mommy, come...

1063
01:28:39,504 --> 01:28:41,232
Fuck!

1064
01:28:46,512 --> 01:28:48,240
Shit!

1065
01:28:49,401 --> 01:28:51,379
Are you hurt?

1066
01:28:51,955 --> 01:28:54,643
We can make it.
I was shot in the arm.

1067
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:56,756
We can make it, come on!

1068
01:29:12,594 --> 01:29:15,474
Listen, you go ahead.
You can make it.

1069
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:19,217
I'm gonna just... hold them
off here, and I'll join you soon.

1070
01:29:19,371 --> 01:29:22,952
No, we stick together.
I'm not leaving you here.

1071
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:26,120
Take your boy and go home.
You have to make it.

1072
01:29:26,217 --> 01:29:29,000
Don't make me go through
all of this and not make it.

1073
01:29:29,097 --> 01:29:32,235
Do you understand?
-I will come back for you.

1074
01:29:32,428 --> 01:29:35,403
Go! Go now before
I change my mind! Go!

1075
01:29:35,835 --> 01:29:38,484
Three years. I promise.

1076
01:30:02,867 --> 01:30:05,555
I'm not fuckin' scared of you!

1077
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:14,964
Quit fuckin' with me!

1078
01:30:58,929 --> 01:31:01,233
You want me?
You want me?

1079
01:31:05,936 --> 01:31:08,047
Is that all you got?

1080
01:31:09,391 --> 01:31:11,887
Is that all you fuckin' got?

1081
01:31:14,191 --> 01:31:17,839
Some kind of quite extraordinary
light from the mothership.

1082
01:31:18,031 --> 01:31:21,103
I've never seen anything like it.
It's a beam of light...

1083
01:31:28,207 --> 01:31:30,895
Full scan. Okay.

1084
01:31:34,351 --> 01:31:36,079
Fire!

1085
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:09,869
Get to the vehicle, now! Get going.
-Yes colonel. -Go, go, go!

1086
01:32:33,292 --> 01:32:35,020
Fuck!

1087
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:38,476
Quit playing with me, Koobus!

1088
01:32:38,764 --> 01:32:40,876
You fucker!

1089
01:32:59,210 --> 01:33:01,706
Go, Chris, go.

1090
01:33:02,283 --> 01:33:04,395
Go home.

1091
01:34:36,368 --> 01:34:39,056
We go home now?

1092
01:34:39,325 --> 01:34:41,062
Yes.

1093
01:34:48,185 --> 01:34:51,632
74 HOURS AFTER EXPOSURE

1094
01:35:05,934 --> 01:35:07,854
Unbelievable.

1095
01:35:08,622 --> 01:35:11,694
Now I know why everybody
wants a piece of you.

1096
01:35:14,670 --> 01:35:17,742
I can't wait for those
med boys to cut you up.

1097
01:35:17,838 --> 01:35:19,950
But you know what?

1098
01:35:20,046 --> 01:35:22,926
You're not gonna waste
any more of my time.

1099
01:35:23,023 --> 01:35:25,518
You half-breed piece of shit!

1100
01:35:27,246 --> 01:35:30,318
I'm gonna just fuckin'
kill you myself.

1101
01:35:38,285 --> 01:35:41,549
Stay back, you fuck!
Stay back!

1102
01:35:43,565 --> 01:35:45,485
Stay back!

1103
01:37:07,551 --> 01:37:10,499
The people everywhere
across Johannesburg

1104
01:37:10,596 --> 01:37:13,703
are flooding the streets and
pouring out of their offices

1105
01:37:13,801 --> 01:37:17,834
and all eyes are pointed up towards
the sky on this momentous day.

1106
01:37:17,931 --> 01:37:21,387
It's the first time, ladies and
gentlemen, in over two decades,

1107
01:37:21,485 --> 01:37:24,556
that the mothership has shown
any sign of movement,

1108
01:37:24,653 --> 01:37:27,340
and people are
tremendously excited.

1109
01:37:27,437 --> 01:37:30,509
The city had come
to an absolute standstill.

1110
01:37:30,606 --> 01:37:33,870
Everybody wants to know
what's going to happen next.

1111
01:37:34,228 --> 01:37:37,511
There's no way of knowing whether
or not Christopher Johnson will return.

1112
01:37:37,607 --> 01:37:39,719
We don't know if
he was simply escaping,

1113
01:37:39,826 --> 01:37:42,311
whether he will
effect a rescue plan...

1114
01:37:43,848 --> 01:37:46,343
...and, as the so called
free press says,

1115
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:49,320
whether or not he will come back
and declare a war on us.

1116
01:38:13,895 --> 01:38:17,638
This is the last known footage
of Wikus Van De Merwe.

1117
01:38:18,119 --> 01:38:22,533
And we can only speculate
as to what has happened to him.

1118
01:38:23,301 --> 01:38:26,757
The more zany conspiracy
theories state that

1119
01:38:26,949 --> 01:38:30,405
he's been captured by MNU
or by another government.

1120
01:38:30,597 --> 01:38:33,477
Or by perhaps some
shady government agency

1121
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:36,357
and he's actually
being held in captivity.

1122
01:38:36,454 --> 01:38:39,237
If we knew where he was,
we would try and help him,

1123
01:38:39,333 --> 01:38:42,404
and that is the most difficult part,
not knowing where he is.

1124
01:38:42,692 --> 01:38:46,724
Wikus, sadly, is gone but
I'm the one who stays behind

1125
01:38:46,821 --> 01:38:50,469
with all the questions.
I can't give the answers.

1126
01:38:50,948 --> 01:38:54,788
He died in my mind a long
time ago. And that's that.

1127
01:38:55,268 --> 01:38:59,108
Wikus Van Der Merwe is a name
that will become very widely known

1128
01:38:59,204 --> 01:39:03,044
because of this pivotal role
that he played in this whole event.

1129
01:39:03,236 --> 01:39:06,692
He was an honest man, and he didn't
deserve any of what happened to him.

1130
01:39:06,788 --> 01:39:10,052
I mean, I know. I looked into a
computer system and I found stuff.

1131
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:13,315
I mean, the whole data
was there, you know?

1132
01:39:13,412 --> 01:39:16,387
They didn't even do
a good job of hiding it.

1133
01:39:16,771 --> 01:39:19,842
<i>Fundiswa Mhlanga is
currently awaiting trial</i>

1134
01:39:19,939 --> 01:39:23,011
<i>for exposing MNU's illegal
genetic research program.</i>

1135
01:39:23,394 --> 01:39:26,159
<i>District 9 was demolished</i>

1136
01:39:26,256 --> 01:39:29,328
<i>after the alien resettlement
operation was completed.</i>

1137
01:39:29,442 --> 01:39:32,591
<i>District 10 now houses 2.5 million
aliens and continues to grow...</i>

1138
01:39:33,263 --> 01:39:36,911
You guys haven't seen a picture of
my wife. Let me show you my wife.

1139
01:39:37,295 --> 01:39:39,407
She's my special angel.

1140
01:39:39,503 --> 01:39:42,383
She even looks like an angel
with veil, you want to see that?

1141
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:45,167
Look, you see,
with the white veil over the...

1142
01:39:45,263 --> 01:39:48,911
she even looks like an angel.
Everyone says that his wife is angel,

1143
01:39:49,007 --> 01:39:52,078
but this is a real angel that you
see there, on the cameras.

1144
01:39:52,174 --> 01:39:55,246
They won't put that
in the video, I don't think.

1145
01:39:59,757 --> 01:40:02,253
I found this at my front door.

1146
01:40:02,350 --> 01:40:05,038
As tho somebody had
just left it there.

1147
01:40:06,381 --> 01:40:09,069
My friends say that
I should throw it away,

1148
01:40:09,166 --> 01:40:11,470
cause it's just a piece of rubbish.

1149
01:40:11,949 --> 01:40:14,829
That it couldn't possibly
come from him.

1150
01:40:15,981 --> 01:40:18,285
I know it's true.
