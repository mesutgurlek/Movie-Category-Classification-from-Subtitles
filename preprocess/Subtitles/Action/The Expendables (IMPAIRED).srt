00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,960
Don't shoot me.

2
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:21,689
Who is that?

3
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:24,772
There's your money, release the hostage

4
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:27,211
How much in there? -
Three -

5
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:30,073
You're too late. We want five million dollars

6
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:36,105
Wha'da ya know, a greedy pirate

7
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:40,714
Last chance, take it or leave it

8
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,826
We want the money... now!

9
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,871
Goal in front of me-
No!-

10
00:04:49,117 --> 00:04:50,500
A little low

11
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,326
I'll kill him, I swear I will kill him

12
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:38,451
Drop your guns!

13
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:40,535
Fat chance -
Yeah, that'll happen -

14
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,272
Last chance, let the hostages go

15
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:45,433
or you're outta there

16
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,978
Bring the money here to me, Cocoa face

17
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:49,658
I'll take the four on the left

18
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:51,819
Why don't you take the two on the right
leave the rest alone

19
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,170
I'll kill them all, I don't care

20
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,926
You should take the two on the right,
you're not that fast anymore

21
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,914
The only thing faster is light

22
00:06:02,037 --> 00:06:03,238
We'll see

23
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:07,320
Bullets are faster than the blades

24
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:09,961
Bring the money here! Now!

25
00:06:09,961 --> 00:06:11,459
Want money?

26
00:06:13,274 --> 00:06:14,897
. Go and Get It

27
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,354
(cell phone: buzz-buzz!)

28
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,872
What's that?

29
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:21,303
Insects

30
00:06:21,783 --> 00:06:22,704
Excuse me?

31
00:06:23,502 --> 00:06:25,374
Kill him!

32
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,124
I call that a tie -
Come on, you're dreams -

33
00:06:33,086 --> 00:06:34,728
These guys are arrested development

34
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,889
A little compassion, folks

35
00:06:37,455 --> 00:06:38,877
Ya' know, I don't think you hit one of 'em

36
00:06:38,877 --> 00:06:40,644
I don't see any knives actually

37
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:42,200
How you guys doin?

38
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:45,379
What the hell is he doin?

39
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,367
Hanging a pirate -
Don't be rediculous

40
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:51,227
Gunner! What are you doing?

41
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:53,062
Hanging a pirate

42
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:55,319
He's seriously demented

43
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,691
This is not good -
You're on your own -

44
00:06:57,691 --> 00:06:59,852
'Preciate it, it's good to have friends

45
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,129
Gunner

46
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:01,734
Yeah?

47
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:04,115
This is not the way we work
Let him go

48
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:06,123
Why? He'd do it to us

49
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:08,543
Gunner, last chance)
. Let him go

50
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,753
or we let you go

51
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:11,789
It's good to hang pirates

52
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:30,391
We don't kill like that

53
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:32,993
Yeah? Not polite enough?

54
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:36,576
Let him go, Gunner -
How are you a partner? -

55
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:37,488
Very Good

56
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:40,581
My partner here kicked me with steel tipped boots,
can you believe that?

57
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:41,723
You deserved it

58
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,470
This will require stitches -
Maybe -

59
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,564
I hate stitches

60
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:46,775
Everyone does

61
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,185
Let him go, Gunner

62
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:50,626
Let him go

63
00:07:51,394 --> 00:07:52,701
Let him go

64
00:08:28,493 --> 00:08:31,595
He's cool? -
Be careful, go -

65
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:47,278
Gunner, you cool?

66
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:51,283
Yeah

67
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,171
Nah, keep it

68
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:06,869
You appreciate a good blade

69
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:21,543
You alright?

70
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,427
Yes

71
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:24,742
Life just got to him

72
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:28,064
It'll get to all of us

73
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:02,465
Coming

74
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:06,585
Who is it?

75
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:10,407
Someday you'll find a man who'll be
happy just to watch you sleep

76
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:15,814
Hi, didn't know you were back

77
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:16,650
Hey, babe

78
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:19,272
I have just arrived

79
00:10:19,972 --> 00:10:22,123
... hi -
.... Why, you look quite... -

80
00:10:22,729 --> 00:10:24,419
I wish you would have called

81
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,647
I've never been a good caller

82
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:29,566
I hav'nt heard from you in over a month

83
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:32,053
Really?

84
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:34,176
Won't happen again, sorry

85
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:37,979
But, I do have a surprise

86
00:10:38,315 --> 00:10:40,524
The first blend, a special

87
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:42,694
And

88
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:44,865
I have something else for you

89
00:10:46,671 --> 00:10:48,678
Bought something

90
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:52,712
Surprise

91
00:10:54,882 --> 00:10:56,870
It's a good color, but

92
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,126
It's hard to see in this light

93
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:02,200
It looked real shiny when I bought it in the shop

94
00:11:02,276 --> 00:11:04,121
Grace

95
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,350
Is everything okay?

96
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:10,689
Yes?... -
Who's he? -

97
00:11:11,986 --> 00:11:13,647
He's a friend

98
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:16,384
Kinda late.
You gotta name?

99
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:20,734
Friend. She just told you

100
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:25,575
Lee, come on...

101
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:27,073
Don't leave like this.
Lee, I'm sorry

102
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:28,926
I thought that things were good between us

103
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:32,720
I felt like you never cared about getting in my life,
or letting me into yours. Stop!

104
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,757
Sure I did

105
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:38,319
No, I have known you for over a year and a half
. And do not even know what your business is

106
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:40,768
What's wrong? When I am here
I am with you and that is what counts

107
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:44,331
What matters is, when you're here
. You're not really here

108
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:46,367
... You're a good man and I love you but

109
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:48,566
Grace! -
I hate his voice -

110
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,794
Did you say something? -
Don't let him come down here -

111
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,761
You do not understand what I'm saying,
you have to understand

112
00:11:53,761 --> 00:11:54,962
I understand

113
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:57,814
You take care -
Lee -

114
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,144
He's no good, Louise

115
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:44,353
Hey, brother, don't you ever sleep?

116
00:12:45,093 --> 00:12:46,198
. OK

117
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,079
... This is my friend

118
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:51,931
What is your name? -
Cheyanne -

119
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:54,821
Cheyanne, Arapahoe, Charikee, Pony

120
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:57,799
You wanna drink? -
I'm fine -

121
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:03,331
Why don't you run up them stairs and get me
one of them super good brews

122
00:13:03,331 --> 00:13:06,336
6 olive Martini, baby -
Anything for you, baby -

123
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:07,124
You got it

124
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,378
She got a crush on me-
Like the last 50 -

125
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:12,790
Welcome back, my brother,

126
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,010
Damn, you look good

127
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:19,657
Yes, well, my friend

128
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,991
Let's finish this bird up

129
00:13:21,991 --> 00:13:25,236
Yeah, brother. It's taken you a couple of
years to do a couple of letters

130
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,681
We had to get rid of Gunner

131
00:13:31,392 --> 00:13:34,879
Yeah, well, he went crackistan on you ass
you gotta cut 'em loose

132
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:35,944
Yeah, you wanna fill in?

133
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,990
Let me tell you something

134
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:39,430
Remember where we were last time?

135
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:42,840
Where were we? In that mud & blood -
Nigeria -

136
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,125
Yes, your hand was all shot to shit

137
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:48,429
And you were bleedin all over the place,
and I was bleedin and ...

138
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,667
Since that time, I promised myself

139
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:55,229
I don't wanna die all alone full of
holes in the mud and the blood

140
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:58,398
I wanna die with something that counts.
I wanna die with a woman.

141
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,931
I wanna die, ya know, with someone who cares about me

142
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:05,763
Don't wanna die for a woman, I wanna die
laying next to a woman. That's what I want

143
00:14:08,203 --> 00:14:10,806
It is Christmas time -
. Yes, I can smell him from here -

144
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:18,556
Mr. Christmas, how ya doin, brother?

145
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:20,082
I'm good, Toole

146
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:21,879
Take a look at this, what do you think?

147
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,270
Eh, it still looks like a black chicken

148
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,642
Black Chicken? -
Black Chicken? You done? -

149
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,909
Yes, I'm done -
It's a damn raven -

150
00:14:31,127 --> 00:14:32,059
Oh, man!

151
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:33,700
Good to see ya, bud

152
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:36,476
You know what?

153
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,079
For you

154
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,808
I have a great idea

155
00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:44,918
Why don't you let me doodle like a
... I do not know

156
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,395
A Charlette's Web on your head

157
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:52,466
Something different, something exciting
Because you a perfect dome muscular heads

158
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:55,030
... I can put a

159
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,393
web on the top of the head...

160
00:14:58,248 --> 00:15:01,292
Maybe a pregnant Charlette coming out of your ear
peeking around

161
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,357
Making sure them bugs don't come inside...

162
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:06,670
Her long legs dangling down your neck?

163
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:09,110
Yes, sexy, right? -
. Very sexy -

164
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,885
This will give you a little mystery,
a little character

165
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:14,257
and very...sexy

166
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:15,745
That will make you stand out

167
00:15:16,552 --> 00:15:18,213
He's thrilled, though

168
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:19,664
Ok, tell you what

169
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:21,489
I feel a little lucky tonight

170
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:24,561
I'm feeling very acurate

171
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:25,637
Maybe another time

172
00:15:25,637 --> 00:15:27,212
Come on, take him on

173
00:15:27,212 --> 00:15:29,200
Come on, Christmas, bring it, baby

174
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,276
I am a coward in his place

175
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:33,714
He never beat you in your life -
Come on, Christmas, no disgrace in losing -

176
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:52,460
Yes

177
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:00,585
Good

178
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:05,175
Well, I've go 3 pieces of work

179
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:07,403
Two a walks in the park

180
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,025
And one to hell and back

181
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:13,069
I need some time alone -
Hey, cheer up.  Make the meeting -

182
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:06,293
General!

183
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:49,125
Now we can see inside of him

184
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:52,640
And I see lies

185
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,906
He wasn't stealing from you, he was stealing from us

186
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:57,192
Both

187
00:17:58,105 --> 00:18:02,196
Want to rate respect?
Smoke those two

188
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,973
Let's just keep it simple, if the money's right
we don't care where the job is.  Got it?

189
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,414
Let's quit jerkin' off...

190
00:18:20,414 --> 00:18:24,227
Get down to business, see who's hungry.
I know your real name's probably not Barney Ross

191
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:26,579
You don't need to know my name

192
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:29,192
The only thing you need to know is that the job's real...

193
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,248
and the money's real.

194
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:32,159
And since we're in this beautiful place

195
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:35,636
Just Call me Mr. Church

196
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:38,603
Ok, Church, what can I do for you?

197
00:18:39,304 --> 00:18:42,108
In a minute. Still waiting for one more guy.

198
00:18:42,108 --> 00:18:43,146
Who?

199
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:57,513
You know him? -
Yeah, we used to be on the same team together-

200
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,712
What's my oldest worst friend doin' here?

201
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:01,825
Both your names came to the top of the list.

202
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:03,698
Is this a problem?

203
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,214
Yeah, should'a shot 'em when I had a chance.

204
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,933
Big Barney Ross!

205
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:09,373
Bigger Trent Mouzier

206
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:10,978
What are you doing here?

207
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:12,062
Praying for work?

208
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:12,994
Could be

209
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:14,348
Have you been sick?

210
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:15,875
You've lost weight

211
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,919
Really? Well, whatever weight I lost you found, pal.

212
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:23,107
You guys aren't gonna start sucking
each other's dicks, are ya?

213
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:30,741
Let's get down to business,
To see who wants to work

214
00:19:31,423 --> 00:19:32,672
Ever hear of an island called Valiena?

215
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,449
No

216
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,516
Yes

217
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:38,501
It's a little island in the Gulf -
That's right-

218
00:19:38,962 --> 00:19:40,124
You should read more

219
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:41,632
Thanks

220
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:46,146
There are resources on that island that my
people are very interested in

221
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:49,315
But a general by the name of Garza has overthrown
a hazardous government

222
00:19:49,632 --> 00:19:50,678
That's right

223
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:54,703
My people are having a problem with this fanatic Garza

224
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:56,806
So you want Garza gone -
I want him dead -

225
00:19:56,806 --> 00:20:00,378
All it takes is a little army. Only an idiot would do this job

226
00:20:00,378 --> 00:20:01,338
How much?

227
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:03,135
Well, like I said...

228
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:10,117
I'm busy anyway, so give this job to my
friend here. He loves playing in the jungle

229
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:10,942
Right?

230
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:12,229
Right -
That's right -

231
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:14,630
Why don't we have dinner?

232
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,177
Sure, when?

233
00:20:16,177 --> 00:20:17,435
In a thousand years

234
00:20:17,435 --> 00:20:18,337
Too soon

235
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:22,496
What's his fuckin' problem?

236
00:20:22,496 --> 00:20:24,205
He wants to be governor

237
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:28,796
I gotta recon this island first

238
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,388
I have a contact for you on the island

239
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:35,018
Good riddance

240
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:39,187
I got the feelin' that everyone else has passed
on this job, so our fee is... five million

241
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:40,541
5 million?

242
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:44,401
I want half up front, the other half in an offshore account,
you got a problem with that?

243
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:46,543
No

244
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,088
What I have a problem with

245
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:51,595
is people who try to fuck me over

246
00:20:53,554 --> 00:20:55,215
So if you take this money

247
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:56,492
And you don't deliver

248
00:20:57,703 --> 00:21:01,083
or you try to fuck me with some kinda weird
cockamamie scheme of yours

249
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:03,955
Me, and my people

250
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,066
are gonna come get you and your people

251
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:11,829
and chop you up into little fucking dog treats

252
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:14,278
You gotta problem with that?

253
00:21:20,328 --> 00:21:21,414
Let's talk

254
00:21:50,062 --> 00:21:54,277
Valiena -
Yeah, Valiena -

255
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:55,853
They got work there?

256
00:22:01,816 --> 00:22:03,075
Come on

257
00:22:03,843 --> 00:22:05,264
I ain't got shit for you, Gunner

258
00:22:05,264 --> 00:22:07,694
Don't replace me

259
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,586
I'm good

260
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:12,332
I'm still good

261
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:16,318
You're still using. I can't trust you anymore, man

262
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:20,323
You can't trust me? -
Yeah -

263
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,287
You can't trust me?

264
00:22:33,489 --> 00:22:35,045
Be careful

265
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:36,591
You threatening me, Gunner?

266
00:22:38,176 --> 00:22:39,463
No

267
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,220
I am a nice guy

268
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:54,675
So, going over the info this guy Church gave me, there's
probably about six thousand people on the island

269
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:56,682
How many soldiers?

270
00:22:56,682 --> 00:22:58,046
Perhaps a few hundred

271
00:22:59,736 --> 00:23:02,300
Wouldn't take much more than that
to control a space that small

272
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,000
Great. They got a small army

273
00:23:04,528 --> 00:23:05,441
And what have we?

274
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:06,468
Four and a half men

275
00:23:07,573 --> 00:23:09,147
Not so funny

276
00:23:09,906 --> 00:23:11,616
I need a raise. -
Why?-

277
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,248
I need the money for my son

278
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:14,948
I want to send him to a better school

279
00:23:14,948 --> 00:23:16,552
When did Yen Yang get a family?

280
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:18,031
I have no idea -
You no ask -

281
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:18,905
I no tell

282
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,508
Anyway...

283
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:24,148
The pay share will stay the same.
That's the way it's gonna be.

284
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:26,780
Now, the target on the island, a guy named
General Garza

285
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,459
What's the problem? -
Who gives a shit what the problem is? -

286
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:31,860
We have problems here is enough for us

287
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:35,010
That we can not get rid of them
. First get rid of us

288
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,429
Totally, when's the last time you seen your analyst?

289
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:42,194
This morning -
Yeah? What you talk about? -

290
00:23:44,277 --> 00:23:47,149
Avoidant Personality Disorder

291
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:49,262
You think too much -
You know, Tollwell? -

292
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:53,632
You're an unusual guy. And you're always gonna
have unusual problems, right?

293
00:23:54,304 --> 00:23:56,916
Unusual? You are talking about my ear

294
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:59,989
Oh, come on, don't start with the ear again.
Not the ear story again

295
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:01,525
Not again, we all know the ear story

296
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,371
We all know

297
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,185
Let's just concentrate on the job -
Hey, no. Shit, no. You guys started this -

298
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:08,200
We all know I wrestled in college

299
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,835
Right

300
00:24:08,835 --> 00:24:11,168
A common injury associated with that sport

301
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:12,513
is trama to the ear

302
00:24:12,724 --> 00:24:13,473
a clot

303
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:18,995
Which, if left unattended, causes a contraction in the cartilage
and forms cauliflower ears

304
00:24:19,139 --> 00:24:22,049
And your point is? -
It ain't easy being green -

305
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:25,708
In any case

306
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:29,626
Me and Christmas are gonna head down to Valiena
and scout the island to see if we should take the job

307
00:24:29,626 --> 00:24:32,354
How much pay?
I need more money for my family

308
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,033
What family?

309
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:36,598
My family

310
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:55,066
Listen, that girl wasn't your type

311
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:58,332
Her lost, right? -
I should've broke that bastard's jaw-

312
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:00,243
Maybe if you were lucky he could've broke yours

313
00:25:00,243 --> 00:25:01,213
Impossible

314
00:25:01,722 --> 00:25:02,692
You know,Christmas

315
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:04,516
I understand, but

316
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:08,925
Let's just say you were with her for a couple of hours,
and it's nice and it's hot and heavy

317
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,557
But after that, think about it...

318
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,401
What do you do for the rest of the day?

319
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:14,571
She probably did you a favor

320
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:17,106
You have more time to feel sorry for yourself

321
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:19,575
You are a great bastard

322
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:22,412
Good morning

323
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,524
Good morning

324
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,586
Good Morning -
Speak English? -

325
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:32,323
Big plane, huh?

326
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:36,529
Yeah, we use it to tranport injured animals -
Why are you here? -

327
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:37,931
Ornithologist

328
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:40,313
We are photographing exotic packs

329
00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:54,794
You're nervous? -
Nervous? -

330
00:26:57,503 --> 00:27:00,221
Why? -
You look nervous -

331
00:27:00,797 --> 00:27:02,516
Do I look nervous?

332
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:05,321
Yeah, your skin looks a little dry, I think
you should fly with the windows closed

333
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,828
It's the altitude

334
00:27:06,828 --> 00:27:08,595
It is the altitude, it'll get to you

335
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,015
What is the address?

336
00:27:35,015 --> 00:27:36,686
Yes, it's in my head

337
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:38,540
Wanna share it?

338
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:40,854
Canteen Gloria

339
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,253
Spanish

340
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:46,789
Who are you? Zoro?

341
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:50,044
Army

342
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,120
Come on, in there

343
00:28:09,473 --> 00:28:10,587
You rollin'?

344
00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:11,692
Yeah

345
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:22,111
Get the suit. Tighten up on the suit

346
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,408
Got it

347
00:28:30,217 --> 00:28:32,934
Look at these clowns, hand picked monkeys

348
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,152
What's wrong with this picture?

349
00:28:46,216 --> 00:28:47,513
Everything

350
00:28:47,513 --> 00:28:49,174
Let's get out of here

351
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:55,186
What's the point? I mean, you think you know
someone, and you truly do not.

352
00:28:55,186 --> 00:28:59,403
Aren't you the guy who said "The man who can best
get along with women is the man who can
get along without them"?

353
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:00,968
That's bullshit

354
00:29:00,968 --> 00:29:02,254
Truthfully, she wasn't your type

355
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:04,252
I wasn't finished -
Look, enjoy your freedom -

356
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:06,778
Yeah, you wait 'til it happens to you -
It has -

357
00:29:13,472 --> 00:29:14,374
Contact's late

358
00:29:14,374 --> 00:29:16,064
Alright, let's go

359
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:18,562
Chill

360
00:29:27,915 --> 00:29:29,942
You ever been rejected?

361
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,384
You're really pushing the boundaries of
our relationship, you know that?

362
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,327
Is that our contact?-
Could be-

363
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:59,252
I'll bet she's all about it -
Stay focused -

364
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,448
You the contact? -
I'm Sandra -

365
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:06,388
What are your names?

366
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,453
(Buda)

367
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:08,414
(Pest)

368
00:30:12,553 --> 00:30:13,581
Follow me, please

369
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:20,592
Buda...Pest...nice.

370
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:33,758
You do all these?

371
00:30:33,758 --> 00:30:35,429
Yes

372
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:37,110
Take one

373
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,836
A gift -
I don't take free gifts, ah... -

374
00:30:41,489 --> 00:30:45,445
How much do you want for it? -
Nothing taking money for something is not a gift -

375
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:47,981
Taking nothing for something is-
Oh-

376
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:50,103
Is it like this all the time?

377
00:30:50,103 --> 00:30:52,582
This place was a beautiful place

378
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:57,220
Then, one day, they came with money and
General Garza sold his soul

379
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,073
And the people who fight back are killed

380
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:01,369
You said "THEY came with money".  Who's they?

381
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:03,414
Some Americans
That's all I know

382
00:31:03,414 --> 00:31:06,305
But one day all this will change

383
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:09,609
You really believe that? -
Yes -

384
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:14,756
The best day will be the one when we can say
our lives are our own again

385
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:21,181
Do you have family, Sandra?

386
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:26,232
My mother died when I was small
And my father is gone too

387
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:28,575
Sandra, how close can you get to the palace?

388
00:31:28,575 --> 00:31:30,708
The palace?
Why?

389
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:33,656
I just wanna...check out the view there

390
00:31:33,656 --> 00:31:34,991
There is no view

391
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:36,604
Why don't we just go there anyway, ok?

392
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:51,567
Where is my growth?

393
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,668
Where is your manpower?

394
00:31:59,576 --> 00:32:03,120
Do you know how long it takes
for a cocoa field to produce?

395
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,628
Of course you don't, let me tell you

396
00:32:04,628 --> 00:32:06,923
We are 8 weeks behind schedule

397
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:09,737
Kick your peasants' asses,
get me my product

398
00:32:09,737 --> 00:32:12,820
When you talk like this to me in front of my men

399
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:14,520
It's no good

400
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:20,829
I am your lifeline.  I am the one who
coordinates all this confusion

401
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:23,124
I am making you rich

402
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:25,083
And being wealthy is very good

403
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:28,906
It allows people to be the real ass-wipes
nature intended them to be

404
00:32:33,689 --> 00:32:35,091
Sometimes

405
00:32:35,926 --> 00:32:38,029
Things are just not worth the money

406
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,297
Sure they are

407
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,082
Sandra, are we close?-
It's just over there-

408
00:32:57,082 --> 00:32:58,437
Pull over please

409
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,456
Where are you going?

410
00:33:06,456 --> 00:33:07,801
Where am I going.

411
00:33:08,492 --> 00:33:12,881
Well, I suppose you could say
I love to see the world from different views

412
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:16,876
Do not lose my hat

413
00:33:19,757 --> 00:33:21,486
We should get goin'

414
00:33:22,052 --> 00:33:23,252
He's very emotional

415
00:34:02,464 --> 00:34:04,347
What are you looking for?

416
00:34:07,737 --> 00:34:09,100
Sandra...

417
00:34:09,946 --> 00:34:11,472
How do I know you're not setting us up?

418
00:34:11,472 --> 00:34:14,075
What does "setting us up" mean?

419
00:34:14,075 --> 00:34:17,292
You don't look like the kind of person we deal
with all the time. How did you get involved in this?

420
00:34:17,907 --> 00:34:22,440
An American came here. He asked
my friend to show you around.

421
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,322
He was afraid, so he asked me to

422
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:25,398
And you're not afraid.

423
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:26,685
I'm afraid

424
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:29,210
But he said that maybe you can help the Valiena

425
00:34:29,892 --> 00:34:30,978
I don't think so

426
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:32,880
Listen

427
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,473
If I were you, I'd leave

428
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,163
Just leave

429
00:34:43,721 --> 00:34:45,297
You should leave

430
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,564
Do not say anything, let me speak

431
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,438
Run!

432
00:35:51,956 --> 00:35:53,589
Get her -
Got her -

433
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,339
Are you crazy?!

434
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,212
You could have killed me! -
You're Welcome! -

435
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,191
Alright, speed it up!

436
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:20,277
We are on the way

437
00:36:25,866 --> 00:36:27,269
We get out of here it's a miracle

438
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:31,090
She's coming with us, right? -
She'd better -

439
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,663
How can we leave? -
We have a plane -

440
00:36:34,663 --> 00:36:36,180
No, I can not leave

441
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,063
Well, you don't have no choice -
Yes, I do -

442
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,454
They'll find you in an hour -
Maybe, but I'm staying -

443
00:36:40,454 --> 00:36:42,049
Stay for what?
There's nothing here

444
00:36:42,049 --> 00:36:43,326
Not to you

445
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:48,185
Look, you stay here, you're dead.
She's leaving with us

446
00:37:34,349 --> 00:37:36,472
I got the guys inside -
Give me a 60 second lead -
You got it-

447
00:37:36,472 --> 00:37:37,701
Go. Go. Go.

448
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:38,479
Come on

449
00:37:56,092 --> 00:37:56,879
Get in

450
00:37:56,879 --> 00:37:58,666
Get in! -
No, no, I can not -

451
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,721
Let's go -
I can not.  I belong here -

452
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:02,632
There is no time -
Go. You Go -

453
00:38:25,143 --> 00:38:26,180
You look nervous

454
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:51,611
Run!

455
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:07,898
Run, you burfbag!

456
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:57,809
Where is the girl? -
Gone. She won't leave -

457
00:39:58,433 --> 00:40:01,535
Won't leave? Don't know of anybody
who would want to stay

458
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:17,794
I don't believe this shit

459
00:40:17,794 --> 00:40:18,889
Climb, baby, climb

460
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:40,190
Goin' back?

461
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,668
Yeah -
Ride & die -

462
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:42,985
Ride & Die,
let's do it

463
00:42:24,764 --> 00:42:26,435
Great job

464
00:42:26,474 --> 00:42:28,433
That was a statement?

465
00:42:45,844 --> 00:42:49,397
How did two, obviously professionals, pass
right through security personal

466
00:42:49,397 --> 00:42:51,904
kill 41 soldiers and get away?

467
00:42:52,413 --> 00:42:54,545
With help, that's how

468
00:42:54,545 --> 00:42:57,820
Everything is under control except for
one detail

469
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,414
A daughter

470
00:42:59,414 --> 00:43:03,150
Who wants her father and company dead
and gone. Bad Shakespear

471
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:08,326
Some how the Company parasites got to her.
Look, she's your daughter, and that's tragic

472
00:43:09,661 --> 00:43:11,986
But blood or not, she goes

473
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:14,453
To hell with the price of lemons

474
00:43:15,462 --> 00:43:19,716
You don't kill your family -
Come around my house during the holidays, pal-

475
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:40,700
Nice bird

476
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:45,386
First of all, I do not feel comfortable talking business
with a giant carrying a shotgun

477
00:43:46,087 --> 00:43:47,644
Pretty boy wouldn't give it up

478
00:43:47,644 --> 00:43:49,247
Not if you wanna know where they are

479
00:43:49,286 --> 00:43:50,083
What do you know?

480
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:51,840
I was one of them

481
00:43:55,365 --> 00:43:58,150
Why are you turning on them? -
Personal problems -

482
00:43:59,629 --> 00:44:01,876
We settled on 50 -
No, math wiz -

483
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:05,295
We settled on a hundred grand,
up front in my pocket

484
00:44:05,295 --> 00:44:07,274
This guy thinks he's a real bad ass

485
00:44:07,274 --> 00:44:09,473
This case is a bloody joke

486
00:44:09,684 --> 00:44:11,268
Life is a joke, shitface!

487
00:44:12,863 --> 00:44:18,635
If you don't want that Fu Man Chew knocked back into
the 60s, you better keep your gum chewin'
trap shut, and show some respect

488
00:44:18,635 --> 00:44:19,614
Bring it

489
00:44:20,295 --> 00:44:21,852
Hey! Be nice

490
00:44:21,852 --> 00:44:24,348
Need a face lift, pretty boy?

491
00:44:26,635 --> 00:44:28,737
Back off, Peyton -
I'm gonna kill him -

492
00:44:28,737 --> 00:44:30,456
We need him

493
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,828
Back off!

494
00:44:38,044 --> 00:44:42,884
This is what I think is happening. This guy who calls
himself Church is really a front for the CIA

495
00:44:42,884 --> 00:44:45,649
So, we're working for the Agency -
Yeah -

496
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:49,990
Church hired us to take out the General but the
real target is this guy - James Monroe

497
00:44:52,055 --> 00:44:58,345
He used to be with the Agency, but got greedy,
went rogue, and teamed up with the General to keep
the whole drug operation for themselves

498
00:44:58,345 --> 00:45:05,807
And that's a big cash plus. But Church and the Agency
can't afford to send in the Navy Seals or Special Forces
to take out one of their own

499
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:09,092
That would be a bad head line, so they hire us to kill 'em

500
00:45:10,254 --> 00:45:11,455
Then they're back in business

501
00:45:11,455 --> 00:45:14,028
And we're taken out-
Nobody's gonna miss us-

502
00:45:14,028 --> 00:45:16,055
Is it still 5 million?

503
00:45:16,055 --> 00:45:19,503
We'd never live to spend it.
I'm telling Church the deal's off

504
00:45:19,541 --> 00:45:21,519
Sound about right?

505
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:24,141
It's about right -
I agree -

506
00:45:48,486 --> 00:45:49,322
Where is he?

507
00:46:02,305 --> 00:46:03,256
Who the hell is this?

508
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:05,120
Some punk

509
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,455
Do not worry about it

510
00:46:06,455 --> 00:46:07,626
We got your back

511
00:46:07,626 --> 00:46:09,806
If he comes over here
we'll bust his ass

512
00:46:16,769 --> 00:46:17,729
What do you want?

513
00:46:19,064 --> 00:46:20,216
Your life

514
00:46:20,908 --> 00:46:23,684
I was thinking about taking it -
Is that right? -

515
00:46:23,684 --> 00:46:26,930
But I don't do so well in tight spaces,
so going to prison worries me

516
00:46:28,313 --> 00:46:31,261
You shouldn't have bruised her face -
Really? -

517
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:32,999
Would have like to have kept it the way it was

518
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:34,882
Well keep the bitch 'cause I'm done with it

519
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:14,294
I'd still like to deflate your real balls

520
00:47:14,294 --> 00:47:15,351
Friend

521
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:26,204
Now you know what I do for a living

522
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,093
I'm not perfect, but you should have waited

523
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,436
I was worth it

524
00:48:31,172 --> 00:48:32,833
So your daughter paints too

525
00:48:34,149 --> 00:48:36,320
This is how it starts!

526
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,873
Let's go, there's nothing -
This is all how it ends! -

527
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:10,009
What's the matter, Barney? Don't you ever sleep?

528
00:49:10,009 --> 00:49:12,650
Nah. What happened to your girlfriend?

529
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:15,185
Ha. Another one bites the dust, brother

530
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:20,160
I was going to paint this for her and uh...
you know what? I'm gonna finish it

531
00:49:20,765 --> 00:49:22,753
Then I'm just gonna smash the shit out of it

532
00:49:22,753 --> 00:49:24,069
Want be alone?

533
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:27,373
Not really
So what's up?

534
00:49:27,987 --> 00:49:30,388
On the island, there was this girl

535
00:49:30,388 --> 00:49:31,713
Yep, usually are

536
00:49:32,251 --> 00:49:33,519
Yeah

537
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:37,159
She showed us around, she was the target's daughter

538
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:40,568
When she had a chance to leave...

539
00:49:41,883 --> 00:49:42,700
she didn't do it

540
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:44,362
Ump, she had some guts

541
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,837
Why can't I get that out of my mind?

542
00:49:50,969 --> 00:49:52,688
'Cause she stands for something

543
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:55,828
We don't, man, we don't stand for shit.
We used to, but...

544
00:49:56,683 --> 00:49:59,218
That dried all up like this is gonna dry all up

545
00:50:00,034 --> 00:50:02,042
It's your paint is gonna dry

546
00:50:03,175 --> 00:50:03,943
What dried up?

547
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,099
Just belief. Just belief in the soul. Just...

548
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:12,260
I don't know, the human parts, brother.

549
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:16,130
You remember that time we were up in Bosnia?

550
00:50:16,678 --> 00:50:19,511
We took down them Serb bad boys?

551
00:50:22,027 --> 00:50:24,841
All our guys were gettin' chopped up all around us and...

552
00:50:26,195 --> 00:50:27,472
there was blood everywhere

553
00:50:27,472 --> 00:50:30,737
I never thought I was gonna make it out of there,
and I know you didn't...

554
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:32,504
and you didn't either -
Yeah -

555
00:50:32,504 --> 00:50:35,770
Kinda feelin' like...dead too, ya know?

556
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:40,456
My head's all very, very black place.
Didn't believe in shit

557
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:44,163
Just goddamn directly to black

558
00:50:45,268 --> 00:50:51,865
I remember I got this bottle of this local shit they have
over there. That Silvits...I think that's what it was called

559
00:50:53,085 --> 00:50:55,236
And I ain't feelin' no pain now

560
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,442
... and I come up on this, uh...

561
00:50:59,442 --> 00:51:03,956
I come up on this overland bridge, and I see this

562
00:51:03,956 --> 00:51:05,915
.... I see this

563
00:51:08,768 --> 00:51:12,052
I see this woman standing there, ya know?
... and she's uh...

564
00:51:12,811 --> 00:51:16,604
I stepped out, and she saw me,
and she's just lookin' right...

565
00:51:16,652 --> 00:51:19,457
right in my eyes. And I was lookin'
her right in her eyes, and...

566
00:51:20,964 --> 00:51:22,799
I knew what she was going to do

567
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:25,852
She looked at me, and I knew
she was gonna jump

568
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:30,789
You know what I did, man?
I just turned around and I just kept walkin'...

569
00:51:32,345 --> 00:51:34,458
Until I heard that splash

570
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:39,298
And she was gone.
After...

571
00:51:40,796 --> 00:51:42,803
after taking all of them lives...

572
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:44,436
she was one that...

573
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:49,583
I could have saved
but I didn't, and uh...

574
00:51:51,062 --> 00:51:53,992
What I realized later on was uh...

575
00:51:55,393 --> 00:51:57,516
if I'd have saved that woman...

576
00:52:01,069 --> 00:52:03,816
I might have saved what was
left of my soul, ya know?

577
00:52:45,784 --> 00:52:49,212
A wise dead man once told me that a real man...

578
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:51,220
never strikes a woman

579
00:52:51,632 --> 00:52:54,504
You push some, if you have to

580
00:52:54,955 --> 00:52:56,396
but you never strike

581
00:52:58,019 --> 00:52:59,113
It's the way I was raised

582
00:52:59,584 --> 00:53:02,600
This man, however,
does not share that moral dellima...no

583
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:07,392
.... This man

584
00:53:09,697 --> 00:53:10,657
...well

585
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:13,760
So the question is, Sandra...

586
00:53:14,211 --> 00:53:16,996
Why were the Americans here?

587
00:54:38,425 --> 00:54:39,606
Again

588
00:54:39,606 --> 00:54:41,834
What did the American tell you?

589
00:54:41,834 --> 00:54:42,977
What are they after?

590
00:54:45,906 --> 00:54:46,867
Continue

591
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,472
I'm going back to Valiena -
Yeah? Something's changed? -

592
00:55:10,472 --> 00:55:11,980
What is the plan? -
There is no plan -

593
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,091
We need a strategy -
I'm going, and you're not -

594
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:17,599
What? -
I said I'm going and you guys are not -

595
00:55:18,098 --> 00:55:20,431
Are you out of  your mind? -
It's personal business -

596
00:55:20,863 --> 00:55:23,514
You don't owe that woman nothing -
Didn't say I did -

597
00:55:23,514 --> 00:55:25,944
If you want to kill yourself, fine. Your call

598
00:55:25,944 --> 00:55:27,682
Listen, I don't want to kill myself.
You guys take care. I gotta do this

599
00:55:27,682 --> 00:55:28,758
I gotta do this

600
00:55:29,545 --> 00:55:30,256
Hey, hey!-
What?

601
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:32,532
Don't lay this guilt crap on us.
We don't deserve it

602
00:55:32,532 --> 00:55:34,155
Hey, this is my choice, there's no guilt

603
00:55:34,702 --> 00:55:35,643
There's no guilt

604
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,094
Take care

605
00:55:42,597 --> 00:55:43,864
Yeah, fuck it, his choice

606
00:55:44,143 --> 00:55:44,767
Yeah...

607
00:55:53,631 --> 00:55:54,755
I said I'm going alone

608
00:55:54,755 --> 00:55:56,100
I'm going too

609
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,607
Come on, Yang, get out

610
00:55:58,097 --> 00:55:59,220
Just drive

611
00:56:08,277 --> 00:56:10,111
Do not lose your nerve

612
00:56:11,907 --> 00:56:14,240
Don't talk to me, cockroach

613
00:56:25,477 --> 00:56:26,802
Why are you doing this?

614
00:56:27,273 --> 00:56:29,635
Friends die together

615
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:33,256
Hey! Give me the good luck ring. Come on

616
00:56:33,736 --> 00:56:35,878
Don't make me hurt you, Yang. Come on

617
00:56:35,878 --> 00:56:37,510
Speed better than luck

618
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:38,960
Whatever...

619
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:41,611
It's difficult

620
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:43,089
What is?

621
00:56:43,089 --> 00:56:45,357
My life is difficult. I need more money

622
00:56:45,357 --> 00:56:46,279
Why's that?

623
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:48,564
I work harder than the rest -
No you don't -

624
00:56:48,564 --> 00:56:49,582
Yes I do

625
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:53,010
Because they're taller
Everything's harder for me

626
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,989
When I get hurt, the hole is bigger

627
00:56:55,479 --> 00:56:57,054
Because I'm smaller

628
00:56:57,543 --> 00:57:01,087
When I travel, I need to go further -
I know, because you're smaller, right? -

629
00:57:01,539 --> 00:57:02,643
Yes

630
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,822
My life is harder than you think

631
00:57:07,982 --> 00:57:08,914
I need more money

632
00:57:09,587 --> 00:57:10,585
I know, you told me

633
00:57:11,085 --> 00:57:12,342
For your family, right?

634
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:13,716
I don't have family

635
00:57:13,716 --> 00:57:14,763
I know

636
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,452
Maybe one day I will

637
00:57:45,302 --> 00:57:46,531
Get out there! -
Why me? -

638
00:57:46,531 --> 00:57:47,819
Because you're smaller

639
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:06,113
Oops

640
00:58:06,113 --> 00:58:07,429
Do that again, I'll kill ya!

641
00:58:42,175 --> 00:58:42,789
Gunner!

642
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:49,291
Aww! Beautiful!

643
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:51,759
That's good

644
00:59:22,789 --> 00:59:25,190
What are you doin'?
You're dead, junkie!

645
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,892
Insects

646
00:59:55,893 --> 00:59:56,344
Shit!

647
01:00:32,857 --> 01:00:36,027
What are you wearing? Size 3?
Bring it, Happy Feet

648
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,045
My turn!

649
01:01:48,687 --> 01:01:49,081
Gunner!

650
01:01:56,044 --> 01:01:57,138
Shit!

651
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:25,978
You shot me

652
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:30,176
Don't say that. You were gonna kill him

653
01:02:30,176 --> 01:02:32,173
I was just gonna scare him

654
01:02:32,173 --> 01:02:34,286
Don't put that on me, you never liked him

655
01:02:37,013 --> 01:02:38,329
Am I dying?

656
01:02:38,828 --> 01:02:40,730
Shot you a couple of inches above your heart

657
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:45,349
I'll take that as a "yes"

658
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,516
Gunner, who sent you?

659
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:52,235
Who hired you?

660
01:02:52,715 --> 01:02:54,117
Who cares?

661
01:02:54,713 --> 01:03:01,301
Do yourself a favor, don't let go until you
cooperate for once in your miserable life

662
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:03,846
That better make me right

663
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:04,912
You got it

664
01:03:04,912 --> 01:03:07,120
Who sent you? Who sent you?

665
01:03:08,283 --> 01:03:10,751
Is the girl still alive? -
Come closer -

666
01:03:29,075 --> 01:03:30,813
You know, it's not easy being your friend

667
01:03:31,293 --> 01:03:32,349
That's true

668
01:03:32,349 --> 01:03:34,866
Man, we'll die with you.
Just don't ask us to do it twice

669
01:03:35,413 --> 01:03:38,150
I know the lay out.
I'll tell you about it on the way

670
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,484
What the hell happened to you?

671
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:42,481
It's too sad to talk about it

672
01:03:45,776 --> 01:03:46,746
Let's fly

673
01:04:03,485 --> 01:04:06,576
You know, the enemy will
always be terrified of noise

674
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:08,488
Especially shotguns

675
01:04:09,899 --> 01:04:14,452
With this big boy spittin' out 250 rounds a minute,
you tell me who's tolerating that

676
01:04:16,257 --> 01:04:18,898
Absolutely zero

677
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:25,131
So let me get this right: Gunner tries to kill you,
you shoot him, at death's door he gives you
the whole layout?

678
01:04:25,131 --> 01:04:26,581
It was something like that

679
01:04:26,581 --> 01:04:28,473
I would have win -
I know you would have win -

680
01:04:31,825 --> 01:04:33,140
You know what?

681
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,215
I trust you

682
01:04:35,215 --> 01:04:37,817
Want you to meet my girlfriend

683
01:04:38,297 --> 01:04:41,217
(Oomayah Kaboom)

684
01:04:41,217 --> 01:04:42,456
You lost me there

685
01:04:42,456 --> 01:04:48,804
When Oomaya's primer strikes, she gets off
a reentry warhead that arms itself

686
01:04:49,476 --> 01:04:54,720
And when that happens, anything that gets in my
lady's way becomes instant red sauce and chowder

687
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,574
And if that doesn't work...

688
01:05:00,069 --> 01:05:01,836
Her sister will

689
01:05:02,335 --> 01:05:03,863
You should meet my doctor

690
01:05:03,863 --> 01:05:05,149
Too late

691
01:06:27,712 --> 01:06:30,411
It's 3:36. We have 20 minutes to take this
place down. I'll take the cellar

692
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:33,925
We've got company

693
01:06:34,521 --> 01:06:35,923
I've got him. You guys take off

694
01:07:03,149 --> 01:07:07,212
Is there a reason you've taken the soldiers this
man has trained and made them look like fools?

695
01:07:09,161 --> 01:07:11,245
They look like warriors

696
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:17,487
Warriors loyal to me

697
01:07:18,621 --> 01:07:22,827
I thought the people of Valiena hired
these mercenaries to kill me

698
01:07:23,768 --> 01:07:25,996
But then I think, maybe this is your plan

699
01:07:26,448 --> 01:07:28,484
Because you can not control me

700
01:07:28,484 --> 01:07:30,510
And torturing Sandra

701
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:31,845
Works for you

702
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:35,341
You want to kill her to make me suffer

703
01:07:36,513 --> 01:07:39,835
A man can never kill a child

704
01:07:40,834 --> 01:07:41,977
But you can

705
01:07:41,977 --> 01:07:44,464
Bring Sandra here

706
01:07:44,954 --> 01:07:46,394
Bring her now

707
01:07:46,674 --> 01:07:48,652
Or I will kill you

708
01:07:48,652 --> 01:07:49,977
Go get her!

709
01:10:51,255 --> 01:10:52,590
It's me

710
01:10:53,099 --> 01:10:54,271
It's me

711
01:10:56,749 --> 01:10:58,132
I won't hurt you

712
01:10:59,361 --> 01:11:00,619
How are you here?

713
01:11:00,743 --> 01:11:01,839
I just am

714
01:11:04,432 --> 01:11:04,969
Can you move?

715
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:05,930
Yes

716
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:06,890
Ok

717
01:11:13,728 --> 01:11:15,850
Time's up. Where's Barney? -
What's the call? -

718
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:18,424
If he's not come in 10 minutes, we're gonna
assemble the same way we came in -
No way! -

719
01:11:18,424 --> 01:11:20,095
This's what he wants -
Ten minutes! -

720
01:11:20,613 --> 01:11:21,564
Let's go

721
01:11:32,695 --> 01:11:34,510
Stop! Don't!

722
01:11:47,542 --> 01:11:48,954
No, don't kill him!

723
01:11:49,933 --> 01:11:52,046
It's not his fight, it's mine! -
Get here out of here! -

724
01:11:53,228 --> 01:11:53,986
Seal the building

725
01:11:55,282 --> 01:11:55,772
Stand him up

726
01:12:00,671 --> 01:12:03,072
If you didn't have this kevlar vest

727
01:12:03,072 --> 01:12:05,414
your insides are gonna be like fuckin' mush

728
01:12:05,664 --> 01:12:06,759
Well ain't that a shame?

729
01:12:06,893 --> 01:12:08,008
You know you're a lucky man

730
01:12:08,008 --> 01:12:09,515
Well, I ain't feelin' lucky, man

731
01:12:09,515 --> 01:12:10,658
You are a lucky man

732
01:12:12,195 --> 01:12:13,837
He told me to keep you conscious

733
01:12:13,837 --> 01:12:14,567
Did he?

734
01:12:16,488 --> 01:12:18,591
Alright. First...

735
01:12:21,472 --> 01:12:22,740
you're a real tough guy, aren't you?

736
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:24,977
What? -
Are you a real tough guy? -

737
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:27,637
Look at me you piece of trash

738
01:12:28,118 --> 01:12:29,299
How many men you got?

739
01:12:29,299 --> 01:12:30,721
Just your mother!

740
01:12:43,695 --> 01:12:45,356
This is your last time

741
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,008
You give me the right answer

742
01:12:47,969 --> 01:12:49,150
I'll cut you a break

743
01:12:50,715 --> 01:12:54,758
You give me the wrong answer you will die
a damned slow death. Do you understand me?

744
01:12:54,758 --> 01:12:56,429
Yes -
Do you understand me? -

745
01:12:56,429 --> 01:12:57,994
Yep-
Who sent you?

746
01:12:57,994 --> 01:12:58,955
Breathe, can't breathe

747
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:01,375
Loosen up

748
01:13:02,287 --> 01:13:03,478
Who sent you?

749
01:13:05,533 --> 01:13:07,214
Your hair dresser

750
01:15:14,107 --> 01:15:15,538
GO, MAN, GO!

751
01:15:35,437 --> 01:15:36,743
Come on!

752
01:16:00,233 --> 01:16:00,570
Shit!

753
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:23,080
Remember this shit at Christmas!

754
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:28,488
Damn, that thing's loud! -
What happened to you? -

755
01:16:28,488 --> 01:16:29,582
Got my ass kicked

756
01:16:32,598 --> 01:16:33,827
Alright, come on!
Get my rifle, let's go!

757
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:42,210
What's this?

758
01:16:44,093 --> 01:16:47,003
Everything bad that has happened you bring

759
01:16:47,003 --> 01:16:48,030
Take your money!

760
01:16:49,654 --> 01:16:52,689
I only see death with you.
Take it all and go!

761
01:16:52,996 --> 01:16:55,397
I'm not goin' anywhere -
You are done here -

762
01:16:55,397 --> 01:16:57,019
You can't succeed without me

763
01:16:57,019 --> 01:16:58,297
I am the leader!

764
01:16:58,297 --> 01:16:59,660
You're a puppet in a hat!

765
01:17:00,477 --> 01:17:01,947
Shut up! -
No! -

766
01:17:20,568 --> 01:17:21,125
NOW!

767
01:17:24,534 --> 01:17:25,235
Get back!

768
01:17:34,109 --> 01:17:35,549
(Throw down your weapons!)

769
01:17:37,298 --> 01:17:38,095
(There's no way out!)

770
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:42,119
Shit's gettin' old!

771
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,193
Your lucky ring stinks

772
01:17:44,193 --> 01:17:45,038
I know

773
01:17:45,038 --> 01:17:47,516
Let's backtrack -
Building's rigged. This is the only way out-

774
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:01,095
Chopper's ready in 5 minutes-
We're not leaving yet-

775
01:18:10,766 --> 01:18:12,658
What's he saying? -
He's saying we're dead with an accent -

776
01:18:13,139 --> 01:18:14,406
We ain't dead

777
01:18:14,829 --> 01:18:16,336
Blow the building -
Not yet -

778
01:18:16,336 --> 01:18:20,409
We will kill this American disease

779
01:18:36,994 --> 01:18:39,039
Blow the building! -
She's down there! -

780
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:40,365
The money!

781
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:47,097
Blow it!

782
01:18:51,524 --> 01:18:52,984
Blow it!

783
01:18:58,218 --> 01:18:59,668
She's out!

784
01:18:59,707 --> 01:19:01,118
Blow the fucking building!

785
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:47,853
I'm out!

786
01:21:39,713 --> 01:21:41,057
Let's go, come on!

787
01:21:42,325 --> 01:21:43,900
Cut Monroe off!

788
01:22:42,031 --> 01:22:42,751
Come on!

789
01:24:19,815 --> 01:24:20,343
Hey!

790
01:24:20,986 --> 01:24:22,571
It's too heavy -
Give me it -

791
01:24:22,571 --> 01:24:23,580
What do you want me to do?

792
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:24,646
Throw it as high as you can

793
01:24:50,441 --> 01:24:51,459
Blow up the dump

794
01:24:51,459 --> 01:24:52,122
Got it

795
01:25:23,161 --> 01:25:24,495
Monroe!!

796
01:25:25,696 --> 01:25:29,682
Drop the weapons, or I'll
put a bullet through her eye

797
01:25:31,708 --> 01:25:32,563
Don't test me

798
01:25:44,106 --> 01:25:46,315
No No -
Shut up or I'ill kill you -

799
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:51,011
The Agency's parasites hired you, didn't they?

800
01:25:51,492 --> 01:25:55,055
I'd have paid you twice as much...
to go fishing

801
01:25:55,496 --> 01:25:59,645
You have to think I'm pretty freakin'
stupid to surrender to the Agency

802
01:25:59,645 --> 01:26:01,172
Why would I do that?

803
01:26:01,565 --> 01:26:02,929
I created this

804
01:26:02,929 --> 01:26:04,715
I made it all happen

805
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:09,134
And they wanted me out. Why?
Because I saw the big picture

806
01:26:10,026 --> 01:26:11,265
Stop walking

807
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:14,396
And what about me and you?

808
01:26:14,828 --> 01:26:16,240
We both the same...

809
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:18,382
we're both mercenaries

810
01:26:18,814 --> 01:26:20,196
We're both dead inside

811
01:26:21,195 --> 01:26:23,174
Why the hell did you come after me?

812
01:26:23,174 --> 01:26:24,816
I didn't come after you, dipshit.

813
01:26:24,816 --> 01:26:26,094
I came for her

814
01:26:47,269 --> 01:26:48,758
Call it a tie

815
01:26:51,284 --> 01:26:52,378
Yeah, I guess so

816
01:26:53,348 --> 01:26:55,010
You're not as fast as you think

817
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:57,219
I'm beginning to sense that

818
01:27:09,944 --> 01:27:13,324
Same account number as mine. It'll
help get things going around here.

819
01:27:13,746 --> 01:27:14,813
No, I can't

820
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:16,906
You've done so much -
Yeah, well, so have you -

821
01:27:16,906 --> 01:27:18,347
Gift for a gift

822
01:27:18,347 --> 01:27:20,287
You take it

823
01:27:20,287 --> 01:27:21,314
Will you come back?

824
01:27:22,323 --> 01:27:24,109
I promise I'll always be around

825
01:27:33,088 --> 01:27:34,404
Take care, Sandra

826
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,226
Take care

827
01:27:44,213 --> 01:27:44,668
Bye

828
01:28:11,081 --> 01:28:12,118
What?

829
01:28:12,146 --> 01:28:14,653
Truthfully? -
Yeah -

830
01:28:15,786 --> 01:28:17,352
I never really thought she was your type

831
01:28:43,724 --> 01:28:44,875
Come on, let's see what you've got

832
01:28:52,654 --> 01:28:53,810
Ghostdiver!

833
01:28:57,889 --> 01:29:01,250
Ohhhh! You...go...You...go!

834
01:29:04,534 --> 01:29:06,416
So, you're back from the dead

835
01:29:06,416 --> 01:29:07,540
How ya healin?

836
01:29:07,848 --> 01:29:08,770
Good

837
01:29:09,192 --> 01:29:10,863
Considering you could have kill me

838
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:12,583
I forgive you

839
01:29:13,225 --> 01:29:14,100
OK

840
01:29:15,031 --> 01:29:16,068
I would have win

841
01:29:16,068 --> 01:29:17,364
Of course

842
01:29:20,265 --> 01:29:21,063
Hey Garner!

843
01:29:21,629 --> 01:29:24,059
Whatever doesn't kill you makes
you stronger, brother. Therapy

844
01:29:25,883 --> 01:29:26,949
Man's got a point

845
01:29:31,203 --> 01:29:32,144
You know what?

846
01:29:33,259 --> 01:29:34,652
I'm gonna do you a favor, Toole

847
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:37,983
I once knew a man called Toole

848
01:29:37,983 --> 01:29:39,213
I love poetry

849
01:29:40,193 --> 01:29:42,843
to me was the epitome of cool

850
01:29:44,908 --> 01:29:46,147
He was good with a knife

851
01:29:49,998 --> 01:29:51,189
Bad with a wife

852
01:29:52,121 --> 01:29:54,473
That hurts -
But to think he could beat me -

853
01:29:55,981 --> 01:29:57,028
Dreaming

854
01:29:57,441 --> 01:29:59,947
He'd defeat me

855
01:30:00,333 --> 01:30:01,389
Cool Toole

856
01:30:03,818 --> 01:30:05,163
You gotta be a fool

857
01:30:08,818 --> 01:30:28,100
