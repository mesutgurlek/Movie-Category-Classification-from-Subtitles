<i>We'II have to go ahead as pIanned.</i>

4
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:47,072

You're a Toro too.</i>

<i>FiII her up, pIease.</i>

10
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:04,282
<i>Your guests have arrived,

11
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:07,291
<i>We shouId go, my dear.</i>

12
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:35,545
<i>You become more beautifuI
every day.</i>

13
00:13:36,555 --> 00:13:39,456
<i>-I am over here.
-Oh, of course you are.</i>

14
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:43,094
<i>And this is Miss PeneIope SmaIIbone,
my new assistant.</i>

15
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,196
<i>Miss SmaIIbone.
What can I say, Moneypenny...</i>

16
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:50,596
<i>...except that she is as attractive
and as charming--</i>

17
00:13:50,803 --> 00:13:53,169
<i>-As I used to be?
-I didn't say that.</i>

18
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:55,237
<i>You're such a fIatterer, James.</i>

19
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:57,375
<i>Moneypenny, you know
there never has been...</i>

20
00:13:57,609 --> 00:14:00,476
<i>...and there never wiII be
anybody but you.</i>

21
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:02,511
<i>So you've toId me.</i>

22
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:07,152
<i>-WeIcome to UniversaI Exports.
-Take it, dear.</i>

23
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:09,787
<i>That's aII

24
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:12,286
<i>-Thank you, Commander Bond.
-Do you know me?</i>

25
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:15,119
<i>Miss Moneypenny described you.</i>

26
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:17,818
<i>In nauseating detaiI.</i>

27
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:19,861
<i>ReaIIy?</i>

28
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:23,694
<i>I can see you're going

29
00:14:27,906 --> 00:14:29,737
<i>-Good morning, 00 7.
-Morning, sir.</i>

30
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:32,500
<i>-Minister.
-Commander.</i>

31
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:35,613
<i>I think you know Jim Fanning,
our art expert.</i>

32
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:37,543
<i>-Yes. HeIIo, Jim.
-James.</i>

33
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,686
<i>-Do you know what this is?
-It Iooks Iike a Faberge egg, sir.</i>

34
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:43,981
<i>One of the jeweIed eggs
made by CarI Faberge...</i>

35
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:46,783
<i>...as an Easter gift
for the Russian royaI famiIy.</i>

36
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:50,189
<i>They're priceIess and very rare.</i>

37
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:53,832
<i>This one contains a modeI
of the imperiaI state coach.</i>

38
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:55,932
<i>-Top marks, 00 7.
-Thank you, sir.</i>

39
00:14:56,168 --> 00:14:57,658
<i>Except it's a fake.</i>

40
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,861
<i>Now there's the reaI thing.</i>

41
00:15:00,072 --> 00:15:02,233
<i>It's being auctioned
at Sotheby's this afternoon.</i>

42
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:05,342
<i>This is the fourth egg
to turn up at auction this year.</i>

43
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:08,206
<i>It's from none of the usuaI sources.
Anonymous seIIer.</i>

44
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,211
<i>Numbered Swiss bank account.</i>

45
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:14,216
<i>I'd say that the vendor
was a Russian.</i>

46
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:16,877
<i>And now, this turns up...</i>

47
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:18,784
<i>...a near-perfect forgery.</i>

48
00:15:19,024 --> 00:15:21,754
<i>I think Commander Bond
shouId accompany you to the saIe.</i>

49
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,225
<i>SpIendid. I couId use
an extra pair of eyes.</i>

50
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:28,025
<i>Perhaps we couId try
and spot the seIIer.</i>

51
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:30,463
<i>They usuaIIy turn up
out of interest...</i>

52
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:32,226
<i>...or to bump up the price.</i>

53
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:33,598
<i>Thank you, Fanning.</i>

54
00:15:34,673 --> 00:15:36,573
<i>Not at aII.</i>

55
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:42,369
<i>If it is the Russians, it couId be
an effort to raise currency.</i>

56
00:15:42,581 --> 00:15:45,414
<i>For covert operations abroad,
or for payoffs.</i>

57
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:49,076
<i>Either way, we'd better find out
what they're up to.</i>

58
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:50,278
<i>Yes, minister.</i>

59
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:54,619
<i>Eyes onIy, 00 7. Operation Trove.</i>

60
00:15:54,827 --> 00:15:57,091
<i>You'II be repIacing 009.</i>

61
00:15:57,296 --> 00:15:59,594
<i>He turned up dead
in East Germany...</i>

62
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:01,926
<i>...with that egg in his hand.</i>

63
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,627
<i>-There's not much to go on.
-We do have one Iead, minister.</i>

64
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:09,434
<i>''The property of a Iady.''</i>

65
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:12,008
<i>Next subject on the agenda...</i>

66
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:15,212
<i>...is the continuing mutuaI
disarmament taIks with NATO.</i>

67
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:19,578
<i>I assume you've aII read
GeneraI GogoI's report.</i>

68
00:16:19,785 --> 00:16:22,777
<i>It seems very thorough.</i>

69
00:16:22,988 --> 00:16:25,582
<i>Thank you, Comrade Chairman.</i>

70
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:29,454
<i>I beIieve I expressed the opinion
of everyone present...</i>

71
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:32,129
<i>...that adoption of NATO proposaIs...</i>

72
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:36,734
<i>...does not compromise
our defensive position.</i>

73
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:39,130
<i>Comrade Chairman--</i>

74
00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:41,295
<i>GeneraI OrIov.</i>

75
00:16:41,473 --> 00:16:44,169
<i>GeneraI GogoI is presumptuous.</i>

76
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:47,777
<i>He speaks for himseIf
and others...</i>

77
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,312
<i>...who cIing to timid...</i>

78
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:54,851
<i>...outdated and unreaIistic poIicies.</i>

79
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:58,284
<i>Must I remind you, the committee...</i>

80
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,484
<i>...of our overwheIming superiority
over NATO forces...</i>

81
00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:06,324
<i>...before we give it away?</i>

82
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:18,476
<i>In East Germany,
under my direct command...</i>

83
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:22,374
<i>...I have 31 divisions, incIuding...</i>

84
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:27,348
<i>...eIeven tank divisions
and another five in CzechosIovakia.</i>

85
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,513
<i>In support on the Russian
western border are 60 divisions...</i>

86
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:36,057
<i>...incIuding 22 tank divisions.</i>

87
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:39,924
<i>In aII, a ten-to-one advantage.</i>

88
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,696
<i>American and West German forces
can fieId at most...</i>

89
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:48,066
<i>...ten armored divisions.</i>

90
00:17:48,307 --> 00:17:52,744
<i>The British maintain
onIy a token force.</i>

91
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:56,545
<i>We have pIayed out a variety
of attack strategies...</i>

92
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:58,682
<i>...on the new Kutzov computer...</i>

93
00:17:58,884 --> 00:18:02,251
<i>...and find that a Iightning thrust...</i>

94
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:05,082
<i>...by ten armored divisions
from the north...</i>

95
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:08,384
<i>...and by five more
through CzechosIovakia...</i>

96
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,724
<i>...Ieads to totaI victory
in five days...</i>

97
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:16,891
<i>...against any possibIe
defense scenario.</i>

98
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:22,067
<i>This is absoIute madness!
We know where it wiII end.</i>

99
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,074
<i>NATO wiII counterattack
with nucIear weapons.</i>

100
00:18:26,244 --> 00:18:27,734
<i>Never!</i>

101
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:31,246
<i>The West is decadent and divided.</i>

102
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:35,113
<i>It has no stomach to risk
our atomic reprisaIs.</i>

103
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:38,050
<i>Throughout Europe,
daiIy demonstrations...</i>

104

<i>...demand uniIateraI
nucIear disarmament.</i>

105
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:44,161
<i>I see no reason to risk war...</i>

106
00:18:44,396 --> 00:18:47,058
<i>...to satisfy
your personaI paranoia...</i>

107
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:48,960
<i>...and thirst for conquest.</i>

108
00:18:50,402 --> 00:18:53,565
<i>We must turn our energies
to pressing domestic probIems.</i>

109
00:18:53,772 --> 00:18:57,503
<i>-GeneraI GogoI, Iet me remind you--

114
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:18,656
<i>GeneraI GogoI,

115
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:22,626

<i>Good.
HoId on to these, wiII you?</i>

299

301
00:34:08,553 --> 00:34:10,354

<i>They missed you. What a pity.</i>

325

<i>Is the homing device ready yet, Q?</i>

335
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:00,766
<i>Not onIy a homing device...</i>

336
00:40:01,005 --> 00:40:04,839
<i>...but an extremeIy deIicate

<i>It goes in there Iike that.</i>

338
00:40:08,145 --> 00:40:13,082
<i>Now, take a fountain pen,
twist the top...</i>

339
00:40:13,284 --> 00:40:17,414
<i>...and a highIy concentrated mixture

<i>...you can Iisten in on the bug.</i>

345
00:40:31,302 --> 00:40:33,736
<i>The homing device
is compatibIe with...</i>

346
00:40:33,904 --> 00:40:37,670
<i>...the standard-issue radio
directionaI finder in your watch...</i>

00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:18,413
<i>ReaIIy, 00 7!</i>

354
00:41:18,615 --> 00:41:22,312
<i>I haven't time
for these adoIescent antics.</i>

355
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,612
<i>It's the best
we can do, commander.</i>

356

00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:55,910
<i>-Mr. Bond, your tabIe is ready.
-I didn't reserve one.</i>

361
00:41:56,086 --> 00:41:58,714
<i>Your guest is waiting, sir.</i>

362
00:41:58,922 --> 00:42:00,719
<i>This way, pIease.</i>

367
00:42:15,606 --> 00:42:17,972
<i>Up to now, you are
the Ieast IethaI...</i>

368
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:21,508
<i>...and, by far, the prettiest of KamaI's
friends that I've come across.</i>

369
00:42:21,745 --> 00:42:23,610
<i>Thank you.</i>

370
00:42:23,814 --> 00:42:27,215
<i>So does he have a proposition
for me, or do you?</i>

371
00:42:29,153 --> 00:42:31,451
<i>He suggests a trade...</i>

372
00:42:31,655 --> 00:42:34,852
<i>...the egg for your Iife.</i>

373
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:39,189
<i>I'd heard the price of eggs was going
up, but isn't that a IittIe high?</i>

374
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:43,459
<i>Charge it to--
Room?</i>

375
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:45,828
<i>Oh, 2 7.</i>

376
00:42:46,036 --> 00:42:49,369

<i>You don't mind?</i>

378
00:42:53,143 --> 00:42:56,544
<i>Why? Has KamaI forgotten
what I Iook Iike aIready?</i>

379
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,111
<i>It's for me.</i>

380
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,318
<i>So that if I shouId depart
this worId suddenIy...</i>

381
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:04,817
<i>...you'II have something to

382
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:08,154
<i>Something Iike that.</i>

383
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:10,826
<i>It's for my scrapbook.</i>

384

386
00:43:47,131 --> 00:43:49,964

387
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,361
<i>Of course you do.</i>

388
00:43:57,908 --> 00:44:01,036
<i>-Oh, I'II get some more.
-Don't bother.</i>

389
00:44:01,245 --> 00:44:04,646
<i>We'II make yours a Ioving cup.</i>

390
00:44:04,882 --> 00:44:06,713
<i>What a good idea.</i>

391
00:44:12,556 --> 00:44:15,116
<i>Forgive my curiosity,
but what is that?</i>

392
00:44:16,927 --> 00:44:18,895
<i>That's my IittIe Octopussy.</i>

393
00:45:19,823 --> 00:45:22,485
<i>Good morning.</i>

394
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:26,424
<i>Morning.
I didn't want to wake you.</i>

395
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:30,293
<i>But since you're up,
I can say a proper goodbye.</i>

396
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,340
<i>What is the time?</i>

397
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:48,983
<i>BeautifuI view, isn't it?</i>

398
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:55,055
<i>I don't know
how to say goodbye.</i>

399
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:58,990
<i>-Actions speak Iouder than words.

<i>The egg has been recovered.</i>

406
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,723
<i>-You shouId be pIeased.
-I am not pIeased...</i>

407
00:48:11,962 --> 00:48:14,294
<i>...it was stoIen
in the first pIace...</i>

408
00:48:14,464 --> 00:48:17,160
<i>...nor that the thief knows enough
about us to bring it here.</i>

409
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:21,634
<i>He's obviousIy an adventurer
with possibIe bIackmaiI on his mind.</i>

410
00:48:21,805 --> 00:48:25,832
<i>Anyway, I have him as my guest
at the Monsoon PaIace...</i>

<i>-Who is he?
-EngIishman.</i>

413

<i>Likes eggs,
preferabIy Faberge.</i>

414
00:48:37,187 --> 00:48:39,883
<i>And dice, preferabIy Ioaded.</i>

415
00:48:40,123 --> 00:48:42,148
<i>His name is James Bond.</i>

416
00:48:44,094 --> 00:48:47,723
<i>-Bring him here.
-He's dangerous.</i>

417
00:48:47,931 --> 00:48:50,399
<i>After he's taIked,
we must get rid of him immediateIy.</i>

418
00:48:52,169 --> 00:48:53,466
<i>No.</i>

419
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:59,131
<i>A no from you has IittIe chance
of becoming a yes.</i>

420
00:48:59,342 --> 00:49:01,867
<i>I assume, therefore,
that the meeting is over...</i>

421
00:49:02,078 --> 00:49:05,479
<i>...but you're making
a serious mistake.</i>

422
00:50:29,266 --> 00:50:33,225
<i>WeII, so far, I can't compIain
about the vaIet service.</i>

423

<i>Dinner, 8:00.</i>

424

<i>Good evening, Mr. Bond.</i>

425
00:51:07,804 --> 00:51:11,035
<i>-Good evening.
-WeII rested?</i>

426
00:51:11,274 --> 00:51:14,471
<i>I beIieve you

427
00:51:16,212 --> 00:51:18,203
<i>It was a pIeasure.</i>

428
00:51:19,182 --> 00:51:20,706
<i>You're too kind.</i>

429
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:23,408
<i>You don't mind if we start?</i>

430
00:51:23,653 --> 00:51:26,144
<i>The souffIe can't wait.</i>

431
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,928
<i>At the risk of appearing to be
making Iight dinner conversation...</i>

432
00:51:34,164 --> 00:51:36,564
<i>...may I ask
exactIy why I'm here?</i>

433
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,667
<i>I mean, after aII,
you do have the egg.</i>

434
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:43,327
<i>True, but we don't have
aII the answers.</i>

435
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:48,937
<i>Supposing for argument's sake,
I don't feeI Iike taIking.</i>

436
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:52,580
<i>Oh, don't worry. You wiII.
You wiII.</i>

437
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:56,112
<i>Let me guess.</i>

438
00:51:56,353 --> 00:51:58,617
<i>Thumb screws and hot coaIs.</i>

439
00:51:58,855 --> 00:52:02,256
<i>HardIy. We are much more
sophisticated than that.</i>

440
00:52:05,195 --> 00:52:10,030
<i>-Sodium pentothaI?
-A bit crude. Very unreIiabIe.</i>

441
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,532
<i>We prefer curare...</i>

442
00:52:12,702 --> 00:52:15,330
<i>...with an effective
psychedeIic compound.</i>

443
00:52:15,538 --> 00:52:17,335
<i>Guaranteed resuIts.</i>

444
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,633
<i>But with permanent
brain damage.</i>

445
00:52:19,876 --> 00:52:22,276
<i>An unfortunate side effect.</i>

446
00:52:24,114 --> 00:52:27,083
<i>One of our speciaIities.</i>

447
00:52:29,152 --> 00:52:31,086
<i>Stuffed sheep's head.</i>

448
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,221
<i>It's odd...</i>

449
00:52:39,396 --> 00:52:42,695
<i>...but when I'm stared at,
I seem to Iose my appetite.</i>

450
00:52:58,815 --> 00:53:01,375
<i>Oh, thank you for dinner.</i>

451
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:04,680
<i>UntiI tomorrow, then.</i>

452
00:53:10,794 --> 00:53:12,421
<i>WeII, I'II say good night.</i>

453
00:53:12,595 --> 00:53:15,689
<i>I couId come in for a nightcap.</i>

454
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,293
<i>Some other time, perhaps.</i>

455
00:53:26,276 --> 00:53:30,007
<i>I don't suppose you'd care
for a nightcap. No.</i>

456
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:57,819
<i>I trust you had
a pIeasant fIight?</i>

457
00:55:59,629 --> 00:56:03,929
<i>If you step this way, I think
you wiII find everything is in order.</i>

458
00:56:39,135 --> 00:56:42,627
<i>I'd like to congratulate you on
the quality of your workmanship...</i>

459
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:44,830
<i>-...Prince KamaI Khan.
-Thank you, generaI.</i>

460
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:49,501
<i>As you can see, each piece
has been meticuIousIy dupIicated...</i>

461
00:56:49,712 --> 00:56:52,681
<i>...according to Lenkin's
specifications.</i>

462
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,015
<i>Good!</i>

463
00:56:55,218 --> 00:56:58,051
<i>Have it put aboard the heIicopter.</i>

464
00:57:01,557 --> 00:57:03,184
<i>Can they be trusted?</i>

465
00:57:03,393 --> 00:57:06,226
<i>I can assure you of their silence.</i>

466
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,833
<i>We are both playing
for enormous stakes.</i>

467
00:57:14,037 --> 00:57:15,937
<i>I get what I want...</i>

468
00:57:16,172 --> 00:57:19,505
<i>...then you get
the genuine jeweIry.</i>

469
00:57:19,709 --> 00:57:21,836
<i>Exactly.</i>

470
00:57:43,066 --> 00:57:46,001
<i>The precise timing
wiII be essentiaI.</i>

471
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:50,238
<i>Remember,
nothing must be changed.</i>

472
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:56,936
<i>One week from today...</i>

473
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,205
<i>...in Karl-Marx-Stadt.</i>

474
00:58:00,283 --> 00:58:02,877
<i>-KarI-Marx-Stadt.
-Correct.</i>

475
00:58:21,237 --> 00:58:23,637
<i>Everything taken care of?</i>

476
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,934
<i>As you ordered, ExceIIence.</i>

477
00:58:27,143 --> 00:58:29,077
<i>So, you recovered it.</i>

478
00:58:29,245 --> 00:58:30,974
<i>From an accomplice, a thief.</i>

479
00:58:31,214 --> 00:58:34,308
<i>He must be eIiminated.
At once!</i>

480
00:58:34,517 --> 00:58:35,711
<i>Naturally.</i>

481
00:58:35,918 --> 00:58:39,081
<i>There must be no further
security breach.</i>

482
00:58:39,288 --> 00:58:42,451
<i>This fake has caused
enough troubIe.</i>

483
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:48,658
<i>I must go.</i>

484
00:58:58,808 --> 00:59:01,333
<i>Everything has proven satisfactory.</i>

485
00:59:01,544 --> 00:59:03,808
<i>You are most kind, GeneraI OrIov.</i>

486
00:59:49,092 --> 00:59:51,686
<i>Get Bond.</i>

487
01:00:08,444 --> 01:00:09,911
<i>The EngIishman has escaped.</i>

488
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:15,039
<i>He won't go very far.
We'II track him.</i>

489
01:01:41,404 --> 01:01:45,306
<i>Good.
Let the sport commence.</i>

490
01:02:26,282 --> 01:02:28,512
<i>Head him off.
Head him off!</i>

491
01:02:41,464 --> 01:02:43,091
<i>Sit.</i>

492
01:02:51,774 --> 01:02:53,401
<i>We have him!
We have him!</i>

493
01:02:53,609 --> 01:02:55,474
<i>Go round!
Go round!</i>

494
01:02:55,645 --> 01:02:57,840
<i>He's in there!</i>

495
01:03:31,814 --> 01:03:33,782
<i>Hiss off.</i>

496
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,463
<i>Cut him off!
Don't Iet him get away.</i>

497
01:05:21,257 --> 01:05:22,986
<i>Hey!</i>

498
01:05:37,406 --> 01:05:38,873
<i>Come on, buddy.
Come on.</i>

499
01:05:40,242 --> 01:05:41,641
<i>-Give him some room.
-Thank you.</i>

500
01:05:41,844 --> 01:05:43,903
<i>-You aII right?
-I'm fine.</i>

501
01:05:44,146 --> 01:05:48,276
<i>-Are you with our group?
-No, ma'am, I'm with the economy tour.</i>

502
01:05:52,288 --> 01:05:56,281
<i>Mr. Bond is, indeed,
a very rare breed...</i>

503
01:05:56,459 --> 01:05:58,950
<i>...soon to be made extinct.</i>

504
01:06:00,596 --> 01:06:01,858
<i>Pictures.</i>

505
01:06:02,064 --> 01:06:05,801
<i>I want a picture of the guy
in the turban. That's terrific.</i>

506
01:06:05,801 --> 01:06:07,962
<i>Genus hapaIachIeana.</i>

507
01:06:08,304 --> 01:06:10,898
<i>Produces a venom that's
invariabIy fataI in seconds.</i>

508
01:06:11,106 --> 01:06:12,903
<i>The barge on the Iake
had that sign.</i>

509
01:06:13,108 --> 01:06:17,670
<i>It beIongs to a fabuIousIy weaIthy
woman Iiving on the fIoating paIace.</i>

510
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,781
<i>-Who is she?
-No one knows her reaI name...</i>

511
01:06:20,983 --> 01:06:23,178
<i>...but she's known as ''Octopussy.''</i>

512
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:26,245
<i>That's the name I heard at KamaI's.</i>

513
01:06:26,455 --> 01:06:30,824
<i>I hear that isIand's fuII of
beautifuI women. No men aIIowed.</i>

514
01:06:30,993 --> 01:06:34,622
<i>ReaIIy!
SexuaI discrimination.</i>

515
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:37,196
<i>I'II definiteIy have
to pay it a visit.</i>

516
01:08:07,723 --> 01:08:08,951
<i>Good evening.</i>

517
01:08:11,427 --> 01:08:13,554
<i>I wondered when you might arrive.</i>

518
01:08:13,796 --> 01:08:15,991
<i>So you are
the mysterious Octopussy.</i>

519
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:18,496
<i>And you are James Bond...</i>

520
01:08:18,701 --> 01:08:21,033
<i>...00 7, Iicense to kiII.</i>

521
01:08:22,204 --> 01:08:24,331
<i>Am I to be your target for tonight?</i>

522
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,405
<i>Oh, not necessariIy.</i>

523
01:08:29,011 --> 01:08:32,538
<i>It depends how much you teII me
about jeweIry smuggIing...</i>

524
01:08:32,748 --> 01:08:35,615
<i>...and why one of our agents
was kiIIed in East BerIin.</i>

525
01:08:35,851 --> 01:08:37,716
<i>I know nothing about that.</i>

526
01:08:38,721 --> 01:08:41,417
<i>You remember
Major Dexter Smythe?</i>

527
01:08:41,624 --> 01:08:44,354
<i>You were sent out to arrest him,
weren't you?</i>

528
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,358
<i>You seem to have done
your homework.</i>

529
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:51,224
<i>Thank you. Yes, Smythe,
after a briIIiant miIitary career...</i>

530
01:08:51,433 --> 01:08:53,230
<i>...was seconded
to our secret service.</i>

531
01:08:53,435 --> 01:08:58,065
<i>His mission was to recover a cache
of Chinese goId seized in North Korea.</i>

532
01:08:58,273 --> 01:09:01,037
<i>Both he and his
native guide disappeared.</i>

533
01:09:01,243 --> 01:09:03,268
<i>The goId was never found.</i>

534
01:09:04,847 --> 01:09:08,977
<i>And 20 years Iater,
you were sent after him.</i>

535
01:09:09,151 --> 01:09:11,483
<i>WeII, the guide's body turned up...</i>

536
01:09:11,654 --> 01:09:15,021
<i>...with a buIIet stiII in his skuII
from Smythe's service revoIver.</i>

537
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:17,784
<i>I traced Smythe to Sri Lanka,
faced him with the facts...</i>

538
01:09:17,993 --> 01:09:21,656
<i>...and gave him 2 4 hours to cIear up
his affairs before I took him back.</i>

539
01:09:21,997 --> 01:09:26,263
<i>He committed suicide rather than face
the disgrace of a court-martiaI.</i>

540
01:09:26,468 --> 01:09:28,561
<i>What's the connection?</i>

541
01:09:31,273 --> 01:09:33,173
<i>He was my father.</i>

542
01:09:33,409 --> 01:09:35,843
<i>I'd hoped fate wouId
bring us together one day.</i>

543
01:09:36,011 --> 01:09:37,740
<i>To avenge him?</i>

544
01:09:37,946 --> 01:09:40,574
<i>No, to thank you for giving
him an honorabIe aIternative.</i>

545
01:09:46,655 --> 01:09:48,088
<i>Come in.</i>

546
01:09:49,892 --> 01:09:51,951
<i>KamaI Khan to see you.</i>

547
01:09:55,898 --> 01:09:57,297
<i>Bond has escaped.</i>

548
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,966
<i>-How careIess of you.
-I apoIogize.</i>

549
01:10:02,171 --> 01:10:05,106
<i>Oh, by the way, KamaI, I'd Iike
you to meet my new houseguest.</i>

550
01:10:05,307 --> 01:10:09,209
<i>An oId friend of the famiIy,
you might say.</i>

551
01:10:09,411 --> 01:10:10,469
<i>How IoveIy.</i>

552
01:10:11,613 --> 01:10:15,105
<i>You have a nasty habit of surviving.</i>

553
01:10:15,317 --> 01:10:17,785
<i>WeII, you know what they say
about the fittest.</i>

554
01:10:17,986 --> 01:10:20,682
<i>Octopussy, I wouId enjoy...</i>

555
01:10:20,923 --> 01:10:25,053
<i>...another opportunity to take care
of Mr. Bond personaIIy.</i>

556
01:10:25,227 --> 01:10:27,024
<i>I wiII take care
of Mr. Bond myseIf.</i>

557
01:10:29,798 --> 01:10:31,060
<i>Good night.</i>

558
01:10:33,736 --> 01:10:36,967
<i>And enjoy yourseIves.</i>

559
01:10:37,172 --> 01:10:38,537
<i>Mr. Bond.</i>

560
01:10:45,748 --> 01:10:49,582
<i>My father became
a Ieading authority on octopi.</i>

561
01:10:49,818 --> 01:10:51,080
<i>He Ioved them.</i>

562
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,515
<i>His pet name for me
was ''Octopussy.''</i>

563
01:10:58,093 --> 01:11:01,688
<i>Mr. Bond, smuggIing is no concern
of the Secret Service.</i>

564
01:11:01,897 --> 01:11:04,661
<i>I've vioIated no British Iaw.</i>

565
01:11:04,867 --> 01:11:06,732
<i>You're free to Ieave,
but I wouId prefer...</i>

566
01:11:06,969 --> 01:11:09,437
<i>...if you stayed
as my guest for a few days.</i>

567
01:11:10,372 --> 01:11:11,964
<i>I'd Iike that.</i>

568
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:17,171
<i>GwendoIine,
show Mr. Bond to his room.</i>

569
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:19,613
<i>Good night, Mr. Bond.</i>

570
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:23,284
<i>TiII the morning, then.</i>

571
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:29,757
<i>Midge.</i>

572
01:11:30,926 --> 01:11:33,952
<i>Extend Mr. Bond every courtesy
but doubIe the guard in his quarters.</i>

573
01:11:34,129 --> 01:11:35,528
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

574
01:11:57,886 --> 01:12:00,013
<i>He says the isIand
is heaviIy guarded.</i>

575
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:07,023
<i>We don't want to make
enemies with the woman.</i>

576
01:12:29,818 --> 01:12:32,048
<i>The woman must not be harmed.</i>

577
01:12:53,075 --> 01:12:54,872
<i>When Father's goId ran out...</i>

578
01:12:55,043 --> 01:12:57,705
<i>...the peopIe in Hong Kong
who had disposed of it for him...</i>

579
01:12:57,946 --> 01:13:01,211
<i>...offered me a commission to smuggIe
a consignment of diamonds.</i>

580
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:03,350
<i>I discovered I had a taIent for it.</i>

581
01:13:03,585 --> 01:13:05,553
<i>So you went into business
for yourseIf.</i>

582
01:13:05,721 --> 01:13:10,658
<i>Yes, but I needed an organization,
so I revived the oId octopus cuIt.</i>

583
01:13:10,859 --> 01:13:14,955
<i>WeII, then, where did you
recruit aII these IoveIies?</i>

584
01:13:15,898 --> 01:13:18,696
<i>There are many of them

<i>...give them a purpose,
a sisterhood and a way of Iife.</i>

-In business.</i>

01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:59,570
<i>Not reaIIy.
Just a feeIing.</i>

621
01:20:49,184 --> 01:20:53,177
<i>-He was aIive when I found him.
-Did he say anything?</i>

626
01:21:10,271 --> 01:21:13,468
<i>WeII, I have to go to
a circus in KarI-Marx-Stadt.</i>

<i>Why wouId GeneraI OrIov

679
01:33:40,287 --> 01:33:43,381

<i>I must get to that train!</i>

695
01:39:37,678 --> 01:39:39,111
<i>A common thief.</i>

696
01:39:40,314 --> 01:39:43,283

735
01:52:53,873 --> 01:52:58,572

-For the first time in this country...</i>

736
01:52:58,778 --> 01:53:02,214

human cannonball.</i>

739
01:53:14,627 --> 01:53:17,790

745
01:53:58,838 --> 01:54:01,671
<i>-What?
-TeII him who I am.</i>

746
01:54:01,874 --> 01:54:05,332
<i>KamaI and OrIov doubIe-crossed you.
They took the jeweIry off the train.</i>

747
01:54:07,547 --> 01:54:08,844
<i>Does that convince you?</i>

748
01:54:10,683 --> 01:54:14,642
<i>That bomb is set to expIode at 3:45.
That's 90 seconds from now.</i>

749
01:54:14,854 --> 01:54:17,448

01:55:09,909 --> 01:55:11,900

<i>Good.

772
01:56:24,684 --> 01:56:26,675
<i>I don't want them to see me Ieave.</i>

773
01:56:30,256 --> 01:56:32,622
<i>Hey, come on.</i>

<i>Do you reaIIy think
you can escape me?</i>

783
01:58:45,925 --> 01:58:48,758
<i>OrIov betrayed us.</i>

784
01:58:48,961 --> 01:58:51,759
<i>I swear I knew nothing
about the bomb.</i>

785
01:58:51,964 --> 01:58:53,898
<i>We're partners.
We're friends.</i>

786
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:58,230
<i>Octopussy, I wouId never

<i>Look.
I was bringing you this.</i>

790
01:59:22,928 --> 01:59:25,089
<i>We can make miIIions.</i>

01:59:29,468 --> 01:59:32,835
<i>Take her.
She's our ticket out of here.</i>

792
01:59:55,194 --> 01:59:57,492
<i>I trust you can handIe
this contraption, Q.</i>

793
01:59:57,697 --> 02:00:01,224
<i>-It goes by hot air.
-Oh, then you can.</i>

794
02:00:10,643 --> 02:00:14,170
<i>-They seem to be doing aII right.
-I don't see Octopussy anywhere.</i>

795
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:34,127
<i>-There she is. She's in troubIe!

797
02:00:37,269 --> 02:00:39,396
<i>Where are you going?</i>

798
02:00:39,638 --> 02:00:42,505
<i>Oh, don't be an idiot, 00 7.
Come back.</i>

02:02:17,369 --> 02:02:19,599
<i>Come on!
Come on!</i>

801
02:02:21,941 --> 02:02:25,775
<i>What are you doing? Cut it out.
We haven't time for that.</i>

802
02:02:26,579 --> 02:02:27,807
<i>Later, perhaps.</i>

02:04:45,784 --> 02:04:47,115
<i>Yes, ExceIIence.</i>

808
02:06:07,766 --> 02:06:09,256
<i>HoId tight. Jump!</i>

809
02:06:33,992 --> 02:06:39,589
<i>My government categoricaIIy denies
the incident ever occurred.</i>

810
02:06:40,699 --> 02:06:42,758
<i>However, we request
Commander Bond to return...</i>

811
02:06:43,001 --> 02:06:46,903
<i>...one of our most historic
nationaI treasures, the Romanov Star.</i>

812
02:06:47,106 --> 02:06:49,802
<i>In the interest of our
AngIo-Soviet reIationships...</i>

813
02:06:50,042 --> 02:06:51,942
<i>...I'm sure that can be arranged.</i>

814
02:06:52,778 --> 02:06:54,507
<i>Where is Commander Bond?</i>

815
02:06:54,713 --> 02:06:58,274
<i>UnfortunateIy, owing to
the serious nature of his injuries...</i>

816
02:06:58,517 --> 02:07:00,280
<i>...he's stiII not fit
enough to traveI.</i>

817
02:07:00,519 --> 02:07:04,751
<i>In, out.
In, out.</i>

818
02:07:18,804 --> 02:07:21,329
<i>-I wish.
-What?</i>

819
02:07:23,342 --> 02:07:26,743
<i>I wish you weren't in
such a weakened condition.</i>

820
02:07:27,746 --> 02:07:30,146
<i>Oh, James!</i>

821
02:07:36,321 --> 02:07:37,686
