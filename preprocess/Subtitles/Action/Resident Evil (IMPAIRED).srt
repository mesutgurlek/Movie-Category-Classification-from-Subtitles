1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,100
<i>At the beginning of
the 21st century</i>

2
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,200
<i>the Umbrella Corporation
had become</i>

3
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,500
<i>the largest commercial entity
in the U.S.</i>

4
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,600
<i>Nine out of every ten homes
contain its products.</i>

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,400
<i>its political and financial
influence is felt everywhere.</i>

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,800
<i>In public, it is the world's
leading supplier of...</i>

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,700
<i>computer technology, medical
products and healthcare.</i>

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,900
<i>Unknown even to
its own employees,</i>

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,100
<i>its massive profits
are generated by...</i>

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,700
<i>military technology,</i>

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,800
<i>genetic experimentation
and viral weaponry.</i>

12
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,100
<i>All Umbrella staff must
wear their identity tags...</i>

13
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,500
<i>at all times.</i>

14
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,100
<i>All radiation badges...</i>

15
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,400
<i>will be collected
at 5 this afternoon.</i>

16
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,900
Thank you!

17
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,400
God!

18
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,200
Some people.

19
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,100
- Don't show me.
- Why not?

20
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,100
Because I'm busy.

21
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,600
It's nothing. Fire drill.

22
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,500
- What is that?
- Fire drill.

23
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,000
- Shit!
- What's going on?

24
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,900
- Get the computers covered! Move it!
- I'm trying!

25
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,100
Move the experiments!

26
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,800
Shouldn't the doors open
or something?

27
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,600
It's supposed to take us
to the nearest floor.

28
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,000
Hello?

29
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,200
Hello?

30
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
What's happening?

31
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,300
Line's dead.

32
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,300
Is that a dill? Come on!

33
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
- What's the problem?
- The doors won't open.

34
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,400
- The ones at the back?
- Locked as well.

35
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,300
There's no fire here!
No fire!

36
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,000
- there's no fire here! No fire!
- The code doesn't work!

37
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,200
- What's wrong with you?
- The door won't open!

38
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,400
- And this water isn't going anywhere.
- What?

39
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,400
It's a sealed room.

40
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,000
- Help me with the door!
- Fuck the doors!

41
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,900
We have to get out of here.

42
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,000
What's going on?

43
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,300
Has this happened before?
We have to get out of here.

44
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,600
- Take it easy.
- You take it easy!

45
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,700
Quiet!

46
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,500
Quiet.

47
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,100
What is that?

48
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,700
Oh, my God!

49
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,100
Halon!

50
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,100
Stop it!

51
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,400
Stop it! Stop!

52
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,700
Let me see.

53
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,500
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of this building.

54
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,600
Here, give me a hand.

55
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,800
That's as far as they'll go.
They're caught on something.

56
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,400
That's wide enough.
I can squeeze through.

57
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
I'll get help.

58
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,700
I'm stuck. You'll have to push.

59
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,800
That's it. A bit more.

60
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,200
What was that?

61
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,400
Oh, Christ!
It's the brakes!

62
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,600
- Get out! We have to get out!
- I can't move!

63
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,900
I can't move!

64
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,800
Oh, my God!

65
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,600
- Push her out of the way!
- Pull me back inside!

66
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,900
Pull me back inside!

67
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,700
Pull me back inside!

68
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,400
<i>Today all your dreams come true.</i>

69
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,000
<i>Today all your...</i>

70
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Hello?

71
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,300
Hello?

72
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,000
Who are you?

73
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,900
Don't touch me.
Get away from me!

74
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,000
Down!

75
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,000
What are you doing? I'm a cop!

76
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,900
I told you. I'm a cop.

77
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,200
You're breaking my arm.

78
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,000
Report.

79
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,300
Report now.

80
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,700
What?

81
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,200
I want you report, soldier.

82
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,400
I don't know
what you're talking about.

83
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,800
Sir, the house's primary
defences were activated.

84
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,400
She's probably suffering
side effects.

85
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,700
- What are you doing with us?
- What about the cop?

86
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,800
Matthew Addison.
I'm not getting a match.

87
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,900
Who are you?

88
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,100
I just transferred. They probably
don't have me on file yet.

89
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,300
The locals are inefficient.
It's possible.

90
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,600
Should I secure him here?

91
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,800
No. We take him with us.

92
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,300
You can't do this.

93
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,900
Blow me.

94
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,000
Prep for entry to the Hive.

95
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,400
- Power's down.
- So fix it.

96
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,800
I'm on it.

97
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,000
Are you done yet?

98
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,900
Jumpy!

99
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,400
Stand clear!

100
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,500
- You got a problem?
- How's that door?

101
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,600
- Sealed shut.
- Let me.

102
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,800
Jumpy?

103
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,800
Lie still.

104
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,900
Lie still!

105
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,600
Watch this light.

106
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,500
Follow it.

107
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,300
- How many fingers?
- Three.

108
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,800
Good. Tell me your name.

109
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,800
I don't know.

110
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,900
He's fine.
Memory loss, like the other one.

111
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,200
Let's open that door.

112
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,800
I want to know who you people are
and what's going on here.

113
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Now!

114
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,700
You and I have the same employer.
We work for the Umbrella Corporation.

115
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,100
The mansion above is an
emergency entrance to the Hive.

116
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,900
You were security operatives
placed three to protect that entrance.

117
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,200
What about this?

118
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,000
Your marriage is a fake.

119
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,400
Just your cover to protect
the secrecy of the Hive.

120
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,300
And what is the Hive?

121
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Show them.

122
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,400
Accessing schematic
of the Hive.

123
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,100
<i>Raccoon City,
nearest urban centre.</i>

124
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,400
<i>The mansion, where we found you
and gained access to the train...</i>

125
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,000
<i>which, in turn,
brought us to the Hive.</i>

126
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,100
<i>The Hive is located underground...</i>

127
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,100
<i>deep beneath the streets
of Raccoon City.</i>

128
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,500
<i>A secret research facility
owned and operated</i>

129
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,400
<i>by the Umbrella Corporation...</i>

130
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,600
<i>The Hive houses over 500 technicians,
scientists and support staff.</i>

131
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,300
<i>They live and work underground.</i>

132
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,200
<i>Their research is of
the highest importance.</i>

133
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
<i>Its nature is classified.</i>

134
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,200
<i>Our position on the map
is indicated by heat signature.</i>

135
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Why can't I remember anything?

136
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,000
The Hive has its own defence
mechanisms, all computer-controlled.

137
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,200
<i>A nerve gas was released
into the house.</i>

138
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,200
<i>Primary effect of the gas:</i>

139
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,300
<i>Complete unconsciousness
lasting up to four hours.</i>

140
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,000
Secondary effects can include
acute memory loss.

141
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,000
- For how long?
- Subjective. An hour, day, week.

142
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,500
So, this place was attacked?

143
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,600
I'm afraid things are a little
more complicated than that.

144
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,900
Sir, we've breached the Hive.

145
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,300
J.D.

146
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,700
Got it.

147
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,000
Halon has dissipated.

148
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,800
Easier to work underground,
thinking there's a view.

149
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,500
Looks like we're taking the stairs.

150
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,900
Status.

151
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,700
Red Queen's locked on to us.
She knows we're here.

152
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,800
Who's the Red Queen?

153
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,900
State-of-the-art
artificial intelligence.

154
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,000
<i>The computer
that controls the Hive.</i>

155
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,600
This will slow us down.

156
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,500
Our route to the Queen takes us
straight through these labs.

157
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,900
Rain, J.D.,
see how bad the flooding is.

158
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,800
Kaplan, find an alternate route.

159
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,100
What happened here?

160
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,200
Five hours ago,
Red Queen went homicidal.

161
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,400
Sealed the Hive
and killed everyone here.

162
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,300
<i>Jesus.</i>

163
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,800
When we realized what happened,
we were dispatched to shut her down.

164
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,200
- Why did she do it?
- We don't know.

165
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,900
But outside interference
is a possibility.

166
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,500
Jesus!

167
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,600
You okay?

168
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,400
Here.

169
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,300
- No, I'm fine.
- It's cold in here.

170
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,600
Are you...?

171
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,400
Do you remember anything from...

172
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,700
before this?

173
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,100
No, nothing before the train.

174
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,600
And you?

175
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,700
Nothing.

176
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,800
<i>I found an alternate route
but it will cost us time.</i>

177
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,100
<i>If we double back, cut through
Dining Hall B, we're right on track.</i>

178
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,800
Sir, no go.
The whole level's flooded.

179
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,700
All right,
we're behind schedule.

180
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,300
So let's move it.

181
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,900
Come on.

182
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,700
Poor bastards.

183
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,600
Kaplan?

184
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,500
Dining Hall B.
That's what's on the map.

185
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,300
Maybe you're reading it wrong.

186
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,100
Maybe the Corporation
keeps secrets here,

187
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,900
something you're not
supposed to see.

188
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,300
J.D., you and Rain keep the prisoner
here and secure the exit.

189
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,500
Halon levels are nonexistent.
I think the system malfunctioned.

190
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,300
There may be survives. Give me
a search line but keep it tight.

191
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,700
Move it.

192
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,500
- I said keep it tight.
- Sorry.

193
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,800
I'm not sure I want to remember
what went on down here.

194
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,500
I don't blame you.

195
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,800
- What the hell do they keep in these?
- How do I know?

196
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,600
What's taking so long?

197
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,800
Red Queen's defences are in place.
She's making it difficult.

198
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,900
Let's pack it up.

199
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,400
You. Stay here.

200
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,000
<i>The lights are automated.
Nothing to worry about.</i>

201
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,500
<i>- Transmitter in position.
- Roger.</i>

202
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,800
Running a bypass.

203
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,800
Checkmate.

204
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,300
Move up.

205
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,900
What is that?

206
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,200
That will shut the Queen down.
Delivers a massive electrical charge.

207
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,500
Forces the mainframe to reboot.

208
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Kaplan!

209
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,900
A dormant defence mechanism.
We must've tripped it.

210
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,400
<i>- Put it back to sleep.
- Working on it.</i>

211
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,400
- Open that door.
- I'm trying.

212
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,700
Hold your positions.
Stay calm.

213
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,100
What's that?

214
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,300
- Get them out!
- Something's happening in there.

215
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,000
- Come on.
- Help them!

216
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,300
Down! Get down!

217
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,500
- Something's killing them!
- Don't do this!

218
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,600
Medic! Medic!

219
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,200
- Open the door!
- I'm trying!

220
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,700
You're going into shock.
Stay awake!

221
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,300
Almost there.

222
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
It's coming back!

223
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,300
- Open it!
- I'm trying!

224
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,700
Try harder!

225
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,400
It's coming back!

226
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,600
Oh, God!

227
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,200
- Do it!
- Almost there.

228
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,700
Come on!

229
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,600
- Shit.
- Got it.

230
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,600
All right.

231
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,900
Let's do it.

232
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,400
- Do what?
- We have to complete the mission.

233
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,700
No way I'll go down there.

234
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,100
Her defences are down.

235
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,400
Déja vu, anyone?

236
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,900
Keep going.

237
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,000
Give me a hand.

238
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,800
Get out!
You can't be in here.

239
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,800
Don't listen. She's a holographic
representation of the Red Queen.

240
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,400
Get out!

241
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,400
Modelled after
the programmer's daughter.

242
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,200
She'll deceive us, confuse us.

243
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,900
I wouldn't advise this.

244
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,900
Disabling me will result
in loss of primary power.

245
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,500
She'll say anything to stop us
from shutting her down.

246
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,300
I implore you.

247
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,300
- Implore away.
- Please?

248
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,300
Please?

249
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,100
You're all going to die down here.

250
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,400
That pulse forces
the circuit breaker

251
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,400
to shut down her mainframe
for 30 seconds.

252
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,500
After that, if I don't have
her boards, he can reboot.

253
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,000
They're late.

254
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,600
I'm on it.

255
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,500
J.D., we got a survivor!

256
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,300
We're here to help.

257
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,300
You seem to be in some sort of...

258
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,200
Get off!

259
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,900
Get off of me!

260
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,300
Get her off me
before I stab her ass.

261
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,000
You okay?

262
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,500
She bit me, man.
She took a chunk right out of me.

263
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,500
Stay back.
I'm warning you, stay down!

264
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,600
She's crazy.

265
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Come any closer and I'll fire.

266
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,500
I mean it!

267
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,900
Damn you!

268
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,300
I shot her five times.
How was she still standing?

269
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,700
Bitch isn't standing now.

270
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,100
- What was all the shooting?
- We found a survivor.

271
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,500
- And you shot him?
- She was crazed. She bit me.

272
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,600
She's gone.
She's gone!

273
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,400
Bullshit!

274
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,900
She fell right here
but she's gone!

275
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,400
Look at this.
There's blood, but it's not much.

276
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,000
Looks coagulated.

277
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,600
Yeah.

278
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,200
It's not possible.

279
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,000
Why not?

280
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Blood doesn't do that
till after you're dead.

281
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,800
Can we go now?

282
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,500
Not till the rest of
the team get here.

283
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,700
There's no one else coming.

284
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,100
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Wait.

285
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,900
Quiet.

286
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,100
- Fuck!
- Don't come any closer!

287
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,700
They're behind us!

288
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,700
<i>Jesus!</i>

289
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
They're everywhere.

290
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,700
They're everywhere.
They're all around us.

291
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,800
I said stay back!

292
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,200
Why aren't they dying?

293
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,600
Watch the tank!
The tank!

294
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,500
- Let's go!
- Hurry up!

295
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,900
- Wait!
- Come on! Move!

296
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,000
Come on!

297
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,800
Move.

298
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,800
<i>I can help you get the virus.
I have security codes...</i>

299
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,400
<i>surveillance plans, the works.</i>

300
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,500
Shit.

301
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,100
- We lost the others.
- Keep moving.

302
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,600
- You waited?
- Didn't know the code.

303
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
Come on.

304
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,100
- Shit!
- Come on!

305
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,700
- Hurry up.
- Shit!

306
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,500
- Come on.
- Shit!

307
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,600
- What's taking so long?
- I'm trying!

308
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,800
Come on.

309
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:51,200
- Move! What's the code?
- Hurry, I'm running out of ammo!

310
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,500
0-4-3-2... No, fuck!

311
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,800
- What?!
- 0-4-3...

312
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,200
- What is the code?
- 0-4...

313
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,900
0-3-1...

314
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,700
9-6-5.

315
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,500
- Got it?
- See how easy that was?

316
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:09,600
Shit!

317
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,700
Grab my hand, man!

318
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,000
Don't let go!

319
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,100
Where are the bodies?
Where did they go? Fuck!

320
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,000
Whatever they are,
there's too many.

321
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,600
Whatever they are?
It's pretty obvious what they are.

322
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,600
Lab coats, badges...
Those people used to work here.

323
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,900
All the people
working here are dead.

324
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,200
That isn't stopping them
from walking around.

325
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,700
Where did they come from?
Why didn't we see them on the way in?

326
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,100
When you cut the power, you unlocked
the doors. You let them out.

327
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,800
We're never goanna make it
to the surface.

328
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:06,000
<i>You are security operatives...</i>

329
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,300
<i>placed there to protect
that entrance.</i>

330
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,900
Lisa.

331
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,500
I've got one in the breech.
And an extra mag.

332
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,500
<i>I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes...</i>

333
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:09,200
<i>surveillance plans, the works.</i>

334
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,900
<i>But?</i>

335
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,800
<i>- But there will be a price.
- Name it.</i>

336
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,000
- Who was she?
- My sister.

337
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,000
Corporations like Umbrella...

338
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,600
think they're above the law.

339
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,900
But they're not.

340
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:48,200
There are hundreds of thousands of us
who think the same all over the world.

341
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,300
Some of us provide information.

342
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,300
Others give their support.

343
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,800
Some take more direct action.

344
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,300
Like you.

345
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,700
If your friends had been
more thorough,

346
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,000
they would've seen
through my false I.D.

347
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,900
Then all the red flags
would've gone off.

348
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,900
Quantico, NSA, ViCAP,
all the rest.

349
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,700
There's no way I could've
infiltrated the Hive.

350
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,700
So you sent your sister.

351
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,000
We needed something concrete,

352
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,800
anything to expose Umbrella
to the press.

353
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,100
Proof of the research
going on down here.

354
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,800
What kind of research?

355
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,900
The illegal kind.

356
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,500
Genetic.

357
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,100
Viral.

358
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,800
My sister was going to
smuggle out

359
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,600
a sample of the virus
they were developing.

360
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,600
How was she going to
make it out?

361
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,900
She had a contact within the Hive,
someone I never met.

362
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,800
They had access to security codes,
surveillance, everything she needed.

363
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,700
So why didn't she make it?

364
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,000
Maybe she trusted the wrong person.

365
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,900
Maybe they set her up.

366
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,700
Kept the virus of themselves.

367
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,900
Do you have any idea what the T-virus
would be worth on the open market?

368
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,400
Worth all this?

369
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,100
Yeah.

370
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,900
To someone.

371
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,200
- Don't shoot!
- Close that door!

372
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,800
- They're right behind us!
- Close that door!

373
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,600
Get off!

374
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,600
Son of a bitch!

375
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,900
You okay?

376
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,300
Yeah.

377
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,700
Right behind us.
What about this door?

378
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,800
They’re waiting there too.

379
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,200
And that way?

380
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,800
Dead end. There's no way
out of the Queen's chamber.

381
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,200
So we wait.
Someone doesn't hear form you...

382
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,300
they'll send backup or something.
Right?

383
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,700
What? What's wrong?

384
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:32,400
- We don't have much time.
- Those blast doors we passed...

385
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,200
on the way in from the mansion,
they seal shut in under an hour.

386
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,500
If we're not out by then,
we're not getting out.

387
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,200
What are you talking about?

388
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,000
They can't just bury us
alive down here.

389
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,500
Containing the incident is
the only fail-safe plan they had...

390
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,000
against possible contamination.

391
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,000
And you're telling us this now,
when we're trapped...

392
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,900
half a mile underground?

393
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,600
We have to find a way
out of this room.

394
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,600
What are you doing?

395
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,800
- Where are you taking those?
- I'm turning her back on.

396
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,700
- That's not a good idea.
- She'll know a way out of here.

397
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,100
That homicidal bitch killed my team.

398
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:30,600
That homicidal bitch may be
our only way out of here.

399
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,700
Considering the way
she's been treated,

400
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,800
I'm sure she's real happy
to help us out.

401
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:38,100
That circuit breaker you were
talking about. Can you bypass it?

402
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,900
- Yeah?
- So do it.

403
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,600
Circuit breakers disabled.

404
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,500
This time, if I hit the switch,
she won't shut down. She'll fry.

405
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,500
The charge must've damaged
her boards.

406
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,100
<i>There you are.</i>

407
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,900
<i>Things, I gather,
have gone out of control.</i>

408
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,200
Give me that switch right now.
I'll fry your ass!

409
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,000
<i>I did warn you, didn't I?</i>

410
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:17,500
<i>- Tell us what's going on down here.
- Research and development.</i>

411
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,200
What about the T-virus?

412
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,200
<i>The T-virus was a major
medical breakthrough.</i>

413
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,400
<i>Although it clearly
also possessed...</i>

414
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,800
<i>highly profitable
military applications.</i>

415
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,100
How does it explain
those things out there?

416
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,000
<i>Even in death, the human body
remains active.</i>

417
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,500
<i>Hair and fingernails
continue to grow.</i>

418
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,900
<i>New cells are produced.</i>

419
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,000
<i>And the brain holds
a small electrical charge</i>

420
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,300
<i>that takes months to dissipate.</i>

421
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,500
<i>The T-virus provides a massive jolt,
both to cellular growth...</i>

422
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,800
<i>and to those trace
electrical impulses.</i>

423
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,600
<i>Put quite simply,
it reanimates the body.</i>

424
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,400
It brings the dead back to life?

425
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:03,000
<i>Not fully. The subjects have
the simplest of motor functions.</i>

426
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,500
<i>Perhaps a little memory.
Virtually no intelligence.</i>

427
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,600
<i>They are driven by the basest of
impulses, the most basic of needs.</i>

428
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,700
<i>- Which is?
- The need to feed.</i>

429
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,400
How do you kill them?

430
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,700
<i>Severing the top of
the spinal column...</i>

431
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,300
<i>or massive trauma to the brain
are the most effective methods.</i>

432
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,200
You mean shoot them
in the head.

433
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,500
Why did you kill
everybody down here?

434
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,300
<i>The T-virus escaped
into the air conditioning system.</i>

435
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,900
<i>And an uncontrolled pattern
of infection began.</i>

436
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,000
<i>The virus is protean,</i>

437
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,400
<i>changing from liquid to airborne
to blood transmission...</i>

438
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,500
<i>depending on its environment.
It's almost impossible to kill.</i>

439
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,400
<i>I couldn't allow it to escape
from the Hive.</i>

440
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,600
<i>So, I took steps.</i>

441
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,100
<i>- Steps?
- You must understand...</i>

442
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,400
<i>those who become infected,
I can't allow you to leave.</i>

443
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,100
<i>- We're not infected.
- Just one bite...</i>

444
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,500
<i>one scratch from these creatures
is sufficient...</i>

445
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,300
<i>and then you become one of them.</i>

446
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,800
<i>A check of my systems indicates
my main drive circuit breaker...</i>

447
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,800
has been disabled.

448
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,000
<i>May I ask why?</i>

449
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,600
Insurance.
We need a way out of here.

450
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,400
If you refuse to help,
we flip the switch.

451
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,300
Understand?

452
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,700
After you.

453
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,000
What the hell is this place?

454
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,500
The utility tunnels.

455
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,600
They run underneath the Hive
of water, gas and power lines.

456
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,600
- Been in here before.
- Keep moving!

457
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,600
- Going found in circles.
- This is the route the computer gave.

458
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,800
- I don't know why you listen to her.
- Enough!

459
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,700
We have no choice
but to keep moving

460
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,500
because those things
are behind us, got it?

461
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,400
That mesh won't hold.
Keep moving.

462
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,100
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

463
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,400
- Hold it!
- There's too many of them!

464
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,700
Fuck!

465
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,100
Up on the pipes.
Up on the pipes!

466
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,100
Quickly, everyone, up on the pipes!

467
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,400
- Let's go!
- Come on, there's a way up!

468
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,400
Keep them back!

469
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,800
Go on up, move it!

470
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,500
Look out!

471
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,400
Get over here.
There's too many of them!

472
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:31,900
Go, go, go!

473
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,300
Go on!

474
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,300
I can manage!

475
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,800
Go!

476
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,400
JD?

477
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:24,900
What?

478
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,600
We have to do something
about your wounds.

479
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,200
I'm fine.

480
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,600
I said I'm fine.

481
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,800
You like that, don't you?

482
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,000
You like the way it tastes,
don't you?

483
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,300
Like the taste of that?

484
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,000
She was right.

485
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,900
- We're all going to die down here.
- No.

486
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,600
We're getting out.

487
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,100
All of us.

488
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,300
You okay?

489
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:13,800
God!

490
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,700
Get away!

491
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,900
- Hold on!
- Come on!

492
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,300
Help him.

493
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,400
- I can't.
- What are you waiting for?

494
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,500
I can't focus.

495
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,600
I can't see!

496
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,500
- Go up!
- Climb up there!

497
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,100
You got to keep going!

498
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,200
- Come on!
- Go!

499
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,300
- You can do it! Move!
- You got it!

500
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,700
- Stay there.
- We'll get you.

501
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:14,400
We need to cut this wire and throw it
to him. Then we'll get him.

502
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,100
Hold on.

503
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,600
That's lucky.

504
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,600
I want you to go.

505
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,100
- I'm not leaving you.
- Yes, you are.

506
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,400
You can't kill all of them.

507
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,600
I'm not going anywhere.

508
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,700
I want you to go, now!

509
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,500
Please, just do it.

510
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,800
Just do it now!

511
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,200
Please!

512
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,200
Go!

513
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,400
You'll have to work
for your meal!

514
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,100
Come on.

515
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,100
Give me your arm, okay?
Over my shoulder.

516
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,400
Ready?
Here we go.

517
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,000
When I get out of here...

518
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,300
I think I'll get laid.

519
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,000
You might want to clean up first.

520
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,000
Wait.

521
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:22,900
Are you okay?

522
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,100
<i>Blue for the virus,
green for the antivirus.</i>

523
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,100
<i>Blue for the virus,
green for the antivirus.</i>

524
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,300
- There's a cure.
- What are you talking about?

525
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:22,500
There's a cure.

526
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,200
The process can be reversed.

527
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,800
There's a cure!
You'll be okay.

528
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,000
I was beginning to worry.

529
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,300
This is where they kept
the T-virus.

530
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,100
How do you know all this?

531
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:53,100
Because I was going to steal it.

532
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:57,700
I was your sister's contact.

533
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,100
- You betrayed her.
- I don't know.

534
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,400
- You caused all this.
- I can't remember.

535
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,800
- The truth.
- I don't remember the truth.

536
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,200
I don't understand.

537
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,700
It's gone.

538
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,100
It's gone. It's not there.

539
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,900
I can't.

540
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,200
I just can't. It's over.

541
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,800
<i>I can help you get the virus.
I have access to security codes...</i>

542
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,100
<i>surveillance plans, the works.</i>

543
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,500
<i>But there's a price.</i>

544
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,700
<i>Name it.</i>

545
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,200
<i>You have to guarantee me that
you'll bring this corporation down.</i>

546
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,500
<i>Today all your dreams
come true...</i>

547
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,400
<i>Spence?</i>

548
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Spence?

549
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,000
Thank you!

550
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:15,500
Spence?

551
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,100
We can still make it out of here.

552
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,100
Come with me.

553
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,800
We can have everything
we've ever wanted.

554
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,200
Money's out there waiting.

555
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,600
You wouldn't believe how much.

556
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,400
Is that how you thought
all my dreams would come true?

557
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:02,400
Please.

558
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,500
I wouldn't want to shoot you.

559
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,200
Might need the bullets.

560
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,800
Back off!

561
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,700
I won't take any part in this.

562
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:22,000
Okay, but you can't just
wash your hands of this.

563
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,800
We work for the same company.
You knew what they did.

564
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,100
I was trying to stop them.

565
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,400
You really believe that...

566
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,100
people like him will ever
change anything?

567
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,500
Nothing ever...

568
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,200
changes.

569
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,300
Where...

570
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,100
Where is...

571
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,600
the antivirus?

572
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,600
It's on the train...

573
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,600
where you found me.

574
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,500
Couldn't have been standing
more than their feet from it.

575
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,400
I so nearly made it out.

576
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,300
I didn't realize that
bitch of a computer...

577
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,800
had defence systems outside the Hive.

578
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:14,100
In or out?

579
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,900
In?

580
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,500
Or out?

581
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,000
I don't know what we had.

582
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,200
But it's over.

583
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,200
Back...

584
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:34,900
the fuck off!

585
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,500
I'm missing you already.

586
01:15:57,900 --> 01:15:59,800
Your boyfriend's a real asshole.

587
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,900
He shot the locking mechanism out.

588
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:07,100
I can't believe that son of a bitch
is going to get away with this.

589
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,100
<i>I don't think so.</i>

590
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,900
<i>I've been a bad, bad girl.</i>

591
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,500
Oh, my God.

592
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,200
What the fuck is that?

593
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:37,000
<i>One of the Hive's
early experiments.</i>

594
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:41,000
<i>Produced by injecting the virus
directly into living tissue.</i>

595
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,800
<i>The results were unstable.</i>

596
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,700
<i>Now that it has fed on fresh DNA...</i>

597
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,300
<i>it will mutate...</i>

598
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,800
<i>becoming a stronger,
faster hunter.</i>

599
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,500
Great.

600
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,300
If you knew it was loose,
why didn't you warn us?

601
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,600
Because she was saving it.

602
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,800
For us.
Isn't that right?

603
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,200
<i>I didn't think any of you
would make it this far.</i>

604
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:15,900
<i>Not without infection.</i>

605
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,400
Why didn't you tell us
about the antivirus?

606
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,700
<i>This long after infection,
there's no guarantee it would work.</i>

607
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,400
But there's a chance.

608
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:29,500
Right?

609
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,700
<i>I don't deal in chance.</i>

610
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,000
Fuck it.

611
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,200
No pressure, guys.

612
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,200
<i>You require
the four-digit access code.</i>

613
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,300
<i>I can give you the code. But first,
you must do something for me.</i>

614
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,800
What do you want?

615
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,700
<i>One of your group is infected.
I require her life for the code.</i>

616
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:12,400
The antivirus is right there
on the platform!

617
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:16,300
<i>I'm sorry,
but it's a risk I cannot take.</i>

618
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,400
She's right. It's the only way.

619
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,000
You'll have to kill me.

620
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,900
Otherwise,
we all die down here.

621
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,700
<i>The glass is reinforced,
but it won't hold forever.</i>

622
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:47,800
Do it.

623
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,000
- Get up.
- Just do it.

624
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,700
- Please.
- Do it!

625
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,500
<i>You don't have long to decide.</i>

626
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:57,100
<i>- You have no choice.
- Kill her now!</i>

627
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,400
<i>- Get off!
- You don't have any choice.</i>

628
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,800
- Just do it now!
- I can't!

629
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,100
<i>- Kill her now. Do it.
- Please.</i>

630
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,300
<i>- Kill her. Kill her now!
- Just do it.</i>

631
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,600
<i>Kill her!</i>

632
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,700
Cap?

633
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:44,700
The bitch wouldn't open the door,
so I had to fry her.

634
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,200
Move!

635
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,200
What the fuck was that?

636
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,300
It's a long story.

637
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:21,200
Start it up.

638
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,600
I'll get the virus.

639
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,100
I'm missing you already.

640
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,100
we're in business.

641
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,800
Full power!

642
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,200
We're leaving!

643
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,600
I don't want to be
one of those things...

644
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,700
walking around without a soul.

645
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,400
You won't.

646
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,300
When the time comes...

647
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,500
you'll take care of it.

648
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
No one else is going to die.

649
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Here.

650
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,400
Rain.

651
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,000
Rain.

652
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,000
Rain.

653
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:11,600
I'm not dead yet.

654
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,200
I think I'll have that back.

655
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:20,800
I could kiss you, you bitch.

656
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:27,100
What the hell's going
on back there?

657
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:42,700
- Get us the fuck out of here.
- Any faster, we'll come off the rails.

658
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,700
Open the doors!

659
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,800
Open the doors!
Now!

660
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:15,300
I failed all of them.

661
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,600
I failed.

662
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:24,900
Listen to me. There is
nothing else you could've done.

663
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,000
The Corporation's guilty here,
not you.

664
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:30,800
And we finally have the proof.

665
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,300
And that way,
Umbrella can't get...

666
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,600
away with this.

667
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,900
I mean, we can...

668
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,700
What is it?

669
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:47,300
You're infected, but you'll be okay.
I'm not losing you.

670
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:59,100
- Help!
- Help him! What are you doing?

671
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,000
He's mutating.

672
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:19,100
I want him in the Nemesis Program.

673
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:24,800
Get off!

674
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,200
What's happening?

675
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,300
<i>I want her quarantined.
Close observation...</i>

676
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,400
<i>and a full series of blood tests.</i>

677
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,400
<i>Let's see if she's infected.</i>

678
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,400
<i>Take her to the
Raccoon City facility.</i>

679
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,800
<i>Then assemble the team.
We're reopening the Hive.</i>

680
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:12,200
<i>I want to know
what went on down there.</i>

681
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:15,600
<i>Just do it.</i>

682
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:29,200
Who's in there?

683
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:32,900
Let me out!

684
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:35,400
Let me out!
