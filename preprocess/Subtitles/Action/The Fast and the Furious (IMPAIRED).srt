No.

Yeah, probably.

You're a smart fence, Ted.
Maybe too smart.

psychotic behavior.

move on Johnny Tran right now...

when the dust settles.
Because all we have is behavior.

evidence, because what we have
now is just circumstantial--

What we have is probable cause.

Ever since she was, like,
ten years old.

745

So, naturally, you know,
my brother always
had her attention.

And then she turned 1 6--
