00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,915
I'd rather           
you didn't mention   
any of this to Peter,

146
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:33,186
          if you don't mind.
No, I won't.                

147
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:36,189
Thanks.

148
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,591
(DOOR OPENING)

149
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,893
(DOOR CLOSING)

150
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,529
Let's see what happens      
when we take away the puppy.

(CHATTERING)

152
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,507
Hi. Welcome back         
to  <i>World of the Psychic.</i>
I'm Peter Venkman.       

153
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,376
I'm chatting  
with my guest,

154
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,579
author, lecturer
and psychic,    

155
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,114
Milton Angland.

156
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:05,685
Milt, your new book is called
 <i>The End Of The World.</i>       

157
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,620
Now, can you tell us
when it's gonna be, 

158
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,490
or do we have   
to buy the book?

159
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,059
Well, I predict          
that the world will end  
at the stroke of midnight

160
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,628
on New Year's Eve.

161
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,163
            This year?
Mmm-hmm.              

162
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,401
Well, that's cutting it      
a little bit close, isn't it?

163
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,269
I mean, just from a sales
point of view,           

164
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,071
your book is    
just coming out,

165
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,907
you're not gonna see
any paperback sales 
for at least a year.

166
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,342
It'll be at least
another year     

167
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,844
before you know   
whether you've got
that mini-series  

168
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,946
or movie of the week  
kind of possibilities.

169
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,814
I mean, just            
devil's advocate, Milty,

170
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,983
shouldn't you have said,

171
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,252
    "Hey, the world's  
    gonna end in 1992!"
Wait. Wait a minute.   

172
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,454
Or better yet, 1994?

173
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,491
This is not just        
some moneymaking scheme,
all right?              

174
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:51,798
I have a strong
psychic belief 

175
00:08:51,865 --> 00:09:00,607
that the world will end
on New Year's Eve.     

176
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,375
(SIGHS)

177
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:05,412
Well, for your sake,
I hope you're right.

178
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,681
Okay, but I think     
my other guest        
may disagree with you.

179
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,383
Elaine?

180
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,186
Now, you had         
another date in mind.

181
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,221
According to my source,

182
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,991
the end of the world    
will be on February 14th

183
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,394
in the year 2016.

184
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,830
Valentine's Day.

185
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,865
Bummer.

186
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,069
Where'd you get your date,
Elaine?                   

187
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,505
I received this information
from an alien.             

188
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,574
As I told my husband,

189
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,243
it was in               
the Paramus Holiday Inn.

190
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,647
I was having a drink
at the bar, alone,  

191
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,916
and this alien
approached me.

192
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,751
He started talking to me.

193
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,920
He bought me a drink,

194
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:51,124
and then I think  
he must have used 
some kind of a ray

195
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,992
or a mind-control device,

196
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:56,196
because he forced me      
to follow him to his room,

197
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,099
and that's where

198
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:05,605
he told me about     
the end of the world.

199
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:10,143
So, your alien had a room   
at the Holiday Inn, Paramus.

200
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,245
It might have been      
a room on the spacecraft

201
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,815
made up to look like      
a room at the Holiday Inn.

202
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:18,451
I can't be sure   
about that, Peter.

203
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,953
Of course not,

204
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,322
and that is      
the whole problem
with aliens,     

205
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,290
is you just can't
trust 'em.       

206
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,959
Occasionally,       
you meet a nice one.

207
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,161
Starman, ET.

208
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,698
But usually             
they turn out to be     
some kind of big lizard.

209
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,100
That's all the time      
we've got for this week  
on  <i>World of the Psychic.</i>

210
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,136
   (CAT MEOWS)      
Next week, though...

211
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,339
Give me, Ira. 
Hairless pets.

212
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,607
Weird.

213
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,743
Until then, this is 
Peter Venkman saying

214
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,379
<i>(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

215
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:49,716
see you then. Bye.

216
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,784
Norman, where do you
find these people?  

217
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,120
Weren't we supposed to have
the telekinetic guy        
who bends the spoons?      

218
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:57,223
He cancelled.               
This is the best we could do
with such short notice.     

219
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,092
Look, no respected psychic
will come on the show.    

220
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,260
They think     
you're a fraud.

221
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,128
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
  I am a fraud.    

222
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,531
Mr. Mayor?   
Lenny! Lenny!

223
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,666
Pete Venkman.       
     Can I help you?

224
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,434
Yeah, get        
your hand off me.

225
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,370
Thank you, I'm an old friend
of the mayor's,             

226
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,604
I wanted to say hello,
give him a kiss.      

227
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,940
I'm Jack Hardemeyer,      
I'm the mayor's assistant.

228
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,042
I know who you are,
Dr. Venkman, I just

229
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,711
(LAUGHS)                      
          don't see           
          any ghosts anywhere.

230
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,413
Well, that's why I wanted
to talk to his highness. 

231
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,682
See, we did a little job  
for the city a while back,

232
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,217
and we got stiffed
on the bill       

233
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:27,453
by some bureaucratic bookworm
like yourself.               

234
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,088
Look, you stay away
from the mayor.    

235
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,590
He's running           
for governor next fall,

236
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,458
and the last thing we need is
for him to be associated     

237
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,462
with two-bit frauds       
and publicity hounds      
like you and your friends.

238
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,298
You know, I'm a voter.

239
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:45,872
Aren't you supposed to lie
to me and kiss my butt?   

240
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,373
JANOSZ: All right, yes.

241
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,044
Now I want you 
to put the Vigo
in the arch,   

242
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,513
under the arch there.

243
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,748
Everything you're doing
is bad.                

244
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,384
I want you   
to know this.

245
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,454
You be careful there,
all right?           

246
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:05,425
No one listens to me.

247
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,827
Well, Dana,       
how are you doing?

248
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,896
How's this Bonington coming?

249
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,331
It's coming along fine.

250
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,366
This mixture you gave me
is working really well. 

251
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:17,737
Yes, well I make      
pretty good cocktails,
don't I?              

252
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,540
Yes, you're       
doing really quite
good work there.  

253
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,342
DANA: Thank you.              
              I think         
              it won't be long

254
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,112
before you can
assist me in  

255
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,781
more important
restoration.  

256

Just taking   
a white thing.

257
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:34,487
Well, thank you,    
Dr. Poha...         
             Janosz.

258
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,389
Janosz. Um,

259
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,358
I've enjoyed working here,

260
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,659
but now that my baby's
a little older,       

261
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:42,061
I'm gonna try to go back
to the orchestra.       

262
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:46,065
Oh, I'm sorry         
to hear that, that you
will not be not here. 

263
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,934
Well, could I
say goodbye, 

264
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:50,970
maybe bring you   
to a brunch today?

265
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,640
Well, I can't today,  
I have an appointment.

266
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,575
In fact, I better go. 
      I don't         
      understand this.

267
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,478
Every day, I say,
"Well, can you   
do something?"   

268
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,546
You say,      
"No, I can't  
do something."

269
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,782
Do I have a bad breath
or something?         

270
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:04,350
Of course not.

271
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:13,893
All right.      
Well, I give you
a rain check.   

272
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,862
I think that 
she likes me.

273
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,230
(RUMBLING)

274
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:26,005
(CHUCKLES) 
No, I do,  
I truly do.

275
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:29,042
EGON: This one's interesting,
Ray. Berlin, 1939,           

276
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,211
a flower cart           
took off by itself,     
rolled half a kilometer,

277
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:35,648
300 eyewitnesses.
 My best         
 to the coven.   

278
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:37,684
Berlin, huh?
You know,   

279
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,419
you should also check
Duke University,     

280
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,988
mean-averaging studies       
on controlled psycho-kinesis.
  I pulled it.               

281
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,856

the existence of ghosts.  

551
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:37,623
I don't believe
in them either.

552
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:41,426
I don't want to hear a lot
of malarkey about goblins,
spooks and demons.        

553
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,629
We're going to stick     
to the facts in this case

554
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,898
and leave the ghost stories
to the kiddies, understood?

555
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,767
Wow, sounds like              
a pretty open-minded guy, huh?

556
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,536
Yeah, they call him
"The Hammer."      

557
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:53,172
What can we do?      
It's all in the hands
of our lawyer now.   

558
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,474
I think you guys are 
making a big mistake.

559
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:58,877
I do mostly tax law   
and some probate stuff
occasionally.         

560
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:00,779
I got my law degree
at night school.   

561
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,514
Well, that's fine, Louis.

562
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,083
We got arrested
at night.      

563
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,519
Look, just put       
these guys away fast,

564
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:10,989
and make sure they go away  
for a long, long time, okay?

565
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,825
I don't think             
it's gonna be hard        
with this list of charges.

to call my clients frauds.

575
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,524
Okay, so the blackout
was a big problem    
for everybody, okay? 

576
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,292
I was stuck in an elevator
for two hours,            

577
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,927
and I had              
to make the whole time.

578

But I don't blame them,

579
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:53,031
because one time    
I turned into a dog,
and they helped me.

May I remind the court

that the defendants are under

from performing services

A friend. Who was frightened.

Who was a scared of what was
happening to her,

and your co-defendants

took it upon yourselves

Right, and the first time
somebody gets mad,       

830
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:41,332
the toaster could
eat their hand.  

831
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:44,369
No, no, no, no.              
We put a warning label on it,

00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,806
Ow, did you ever go for it.

834
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,808
The old man-eating
toaster bit.      

835
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,712
Get off!

836
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:57,415
PETER: Hello?                
I'm looking for Dana Barrett.

                  Thank you.

838
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:03,087
Hey, uh,                  
Dr. Venkman!              
                      Yes.

839
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:05,690
<i>World of the Psychic!</i>       
              That's right. 
              How you doin'?

840
00:42:05,757 --> 00:42:07,425
I'm a big,       
big fan of yours.

841
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:08,826
Thank you very much.
Thank you.          

842
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,762
That used to be              
one of my two favorite shows.

843
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,463
You're kidding me.

844
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,598
Oh, great.             
What was the other one?

845
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,466
<i>Bass Masters.</i>

846
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:57,775
It's a fishing show.  
   Yeah. I know       
    <i>Bass Mters,</i>  sure.

847
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:01,245
You're good,
pretty eyes.

848
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,448
I didn't paint it,   
I'm just cleaning it.

849
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:04,715
It's a Gauguin.

850
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,250
Well, I've heard of him.

851
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,019
Well...

852
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:11,122
Dana, aren't you     
going to introduce me
to your friend?      

853
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:15,660
Um, sure.             
Peter Venkman, this is
Dr. Janosz Poha,      

854
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,862
the head          
of our department.

855
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,765
Yes, I of course  
have seen you     
on the television.

856
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:23,501
Quite enjoy.        
Uh, you're not here 
on business, I hope.

857
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:25,169
Well, it's top secret.

858
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:27,572
Say, Johnny, you got
a Gauguin too!      

859
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,408
No, actually I am      
preparing this portrait

860
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:33,144
for the new         
romantic exhibition.

861
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,912
This is prince Vigo,

862
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:38,549
the ruler of Carpathia
and Moldavia.         

863
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,918
Bit of a sissy,
isn't he?      

864
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:44,188
He was a very     
powerful magician,
Dr. Venkman.      

865
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,058
And a genius in many ways.

866
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,495
He was also a lunatic  
and a genocidal madman.

867
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,396
I hate this painng.

868
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,399
I felt                  
uncomfortable ever since
it came up from storage.

869
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,401
Well, you're probably        
feeling what Vigo is feeling.

870
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,270
Carpathian kitten loss.

871
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:00,838
He's missed his kitten.

872
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:02,707
We'll put one in here
by the castle.       

873
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,143
We don't go around altering
valuable art, Dr. Venkman. 

874
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:06,477
Go. Yes, I think go.

875
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:09,180
The joyfulness is over.
          He's kidding 

876
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:13,484
Well, you're not              
gonna get a green card        
with that attitude, pal, okay?

877
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:17,655
I don't know what...     
Oh, of course, of course.

878
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:20,091
I get it. You're sweet
on this hunky stud,   
aren't ya?            

879
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,660
You know, Peter,       
every now and then,    
I get the feeling that,

880
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:34,772
that painting      
is watching me,    
even smiling at me.

we got more food 
on your shirt    

884
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:49,587
than we did   
in your mouth.

You're gonna take  
a bath, aren't you?

you get to do?

than anything, huh?

00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:26,958
Yeah, you get        
to splash Mommy, yes.

her shirt off, too.

to eat Oscar.

there was all this   
pink ooze everywhere,

and it was reaching for him.

             and relax, huh?  
Yes, darling, I'm so sorry.

Dana's just come over
to my place.         

914
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:58,949
Well, actually,          
her tub tried to eat her.

Are you serious?

Well, that's great!     
I mean, that's terrible.

00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,826
But it's great      
for what we would...

Yeah, I will.

920
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,569
      What happened?  
Something came        
out of Dana's bathtub.

921
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:20,905
Tried to grab                
her and the baby.            
          Are they all right?

922
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,374
Yeah, well,                
she got out of there       
and went over to Venkman's.

923
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:26,444
This is interesting, Ray.
Remember the painting    
Venkman mentioned?       

924
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,513
I ran the name             
Vigo the Carpathian through
the occult reference net.  

925
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,451
Look what came up.

926
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,853
Nice ugly history.

927
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:43,694
You think there's a connection
between this Vigo character   
and the...

00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:45,496

to Dana's apartment.

that bathtub.        

932
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,906
It might be a good idea
to go to the museum    
in the morning,        

933
00:47:55,973 --> 00:48:00,010
get a look       
at that painting.

934
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,679
Ray's going to go    
on over to your place
and just take a look.

I got this 
from a girl

00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:14,024
who got this                 
from Joe Willie Namath, okay?

we don't wanna know.

hose this thing down,
you know?

00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:34,378

Hi. Come on in,  
this is my place.

952
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:03,441
So, how are we gonna handle
the sleeping arrangements? 

953
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:05,476
Well, what's best
for me is        

954
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:08,646
if I lie on my side like this
and you spoon up beside me,  

955
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,214
your arm draped over me.

956
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,851
We do it the other way,

957
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:15,953
I get your hair     
caught in my throat,

958
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,955
and I choke  
in the night.

959
00:49:18,022 --> 00:49:22,026
Well, how about you     
on the sofa and me      
and the baby in the bed?

960
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:25,396
It's a way to go.

961
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:28,499
It's so late.   
I really ought  
to put him down.

962
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:30,034
May I?

963
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,803
Yeah, if you want to.

964
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:36,540
You're short,      
your belly button  
sticks out too far,

965
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:50,087
and you're          
a terrible burden   
on your poor mother.

966
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,889
Find anything at Dana's?

967
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:54,592
Nah, nothing but mood slime
residue around the bathtub.

968
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,027
But I did get something
on that Vigo character 
you mentioned.         

969
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,797
Found it in Leon Zundinger's   
 <i>Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.</i>

970
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:01,699
  Dig that.         
Vigo the Carpathian,

971
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:04,301
born 1505, died 1610.

972
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,170
105 years old    
he hung in there,
didn't he?       

973
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:07,838
He didn't die      
of old age, either.

974
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:10,140
He was poisoned, stabbed,
shot, hung, stretched,   

975
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,476
disemboweled,       
drawn and quartered.

976
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:14,545
                 Ouch.      
WINSTON: I guess he wasn't  
too popular at the end, huh?

977
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:16,947
No, not exactly     
a man of the people.
Also known as       

978
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,683
Vigo the cruel,   
Vigo the torturer,
Vigo the despised,

979
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,486
and Vigo the unholy.          
               Wasn't he also 
               Vigo the butch?

980
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:24,121
And dig this.        
There was a prophecy.

981
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,090
Just before his head died,

982
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,993
his last words were, 
"Death is but a door,

983
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:37,768
"time is but a window.
I'll be back."        

984
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:40,571
Let's suck in the guts,      
guys, we're the Ghostbusters.

985
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:43,407
No! No,        
please go. You!

986
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:46,644
           Who's this wiggler?
He's yours, Ray.              
Sic him.                      

987
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,379
    I have discussed this
    with you...          
Hi, how are you?         

988
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,080
Ray Stantz            
from the Ghostbusters.

989
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,949
I tell you, and I told       
your friend.                 
 Beautiful art you have here.

990
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:55,152
 We're just doing             
 a routine spook check.       
Dr. Venkman, Dana is not here.

991
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,788
   Yeah, we know that, Johnny.
So why are you came?          

992
00:50:57,855 --> 00:51:00,090
Well, we got a report
there was a major    
creep in the area,   

993
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,159
we checked our list,
and you were        
right on the top.   

994
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:05,262
Johnny, where in the hell
are you from, anyway?    

995
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:07,164
The Upper West Side.

996
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,800
The whole room's     
extremely hot, Peter.

997
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:12,369
Ew, that's one
ugly dude.    

998
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:14,305
Well, that's Vigo.

999
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:18,008
Mr. Vigo, Veegs, would you  
look this way, please?      
         Please, no don't...

1000
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,443
No, no!                    
         Come on,          
         show me something!

1001
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,445
                   Mr. Vigo...
No photographs, please!       

1002
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:24,148
Slides are available 
in the gift shop, eh?

1003
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:27,117
(SHOUTS)                 
      Yeah, thanks.      
      Thank you, Winston.

1004
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,553
All right, I think...  
You know what?         
Give me angry, will ya?

1005
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,655
Will you give me angry,
you've had a bad day,  
you're cranky?         

1006
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:33,891
Yeah, thank you.
Good, good.     
Ooh, angrier.   

1007
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:36,260
Ooh, I'm scared.  
You're scaring me,
stop it.          

1008
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:39,330
Yeah, good! Okay,        
walk for me, talk for me.

1009
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,664
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1010
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,833
Okay, give me hot and sexy.

1011
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,569
Can you do it?   
You can. Oh, boy.

1012
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:47,004
Show me some teeth,
come on.           

1013
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,672
I bet the girls like ya, huh?

1014
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:51,008
Do the girls?
Do the guys? 

1015
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:53,944
Bet they both do.      
What about the animals?
They like ya?          

1016
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:56,447
That's it, more.       
Yeah, come on.         
You're big, you're big.

1017
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:59,450
All right, destroy me!
Destroy me now, yeah! 

1018
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,385
Destroy me!
Yeah! Yeah!

1019
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,387
                  Venkman...
Yeah, give it!              
Yeah! Yeah!                 

1020
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:07,358
We need to talk.
Come on.        

1021
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:09,393
I've worked with better.

1022
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,396
But not many.
Thank you.   

1023
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,531
John, thanks.

1024
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:17,434
Hey. Hey!               
                    Huh?

1025
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,069
Hey, you finished?

1026
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,938
Yeah, I'm     
finished here.

1027
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:23,374
Are you all right?           
                        What?

1028
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,242
I mean, you're not         
coming down with something?

1029
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:35,285
Me?

1030
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:44,962
Dana?       
Your prince.

1031
00:52:45,029 --> 00:52:48,499
Oh, no.

1032
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,502
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

1033
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,637
She cleaned.

1034
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:56,140
Hi.              
              Hi.

1035
00:52:56,206 --> 00:53:01,645
Shh, he's asleep.
Come here.       

1036
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:03,180
So, what happened 
with my apartment?

1037
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:06,216
Well, the guys spent  
the whole night there.

1038
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:09,053
They went through   
all your things,    
your personal stuff.

1039
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,287
They tried on        
some of your clothes,

1040
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,322
made some                 
long-distance phone calls,

1041
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,624
cleaned out the fridge...

1042
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,226
Did they find anything?

1043
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,429
They found a little bit
of that pink slime.    

1044
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,964
Oh, God.

1045
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,866
Well, what am I    
supposed to do now?

1046
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:26,136
You are supposed to get
dressed and get crazy  

1047
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,006
      with me on the streets
      of Manhattan tonight. 
Peter, I don't think that...

1048
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:30,908
This is exactly
what you need. 

1049
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,177
I have got you
a baby-sitter.

1050
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:34,745
The whole thing's wired.

1051
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:36,947
Peter, I don't think       
we should go out on a date,
you know,                  

1052
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:40,884
and I can't leave Oscar
in a strange place     

1053
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,287
with a strange person.

1054
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,055
Strange person?

1055
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:49,226
Janine Melnitz
from my staff.

1056
00:53:49,293 --> 00:53:52,996
Janine has experience
baby-sitting?        

1057
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,266
Here.

1058
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,402
Thank you.

1059
00:53:58,469 --> 00:54:01,705
I've also           
brought some things 
from your apartment.

1060
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:05,242
Some wardrobe choices,
couple of provocative 
ensembles in here,    

1061
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:08,078
      I'll leave it up to you.
Okay. But after dinner,       

1062
00:54:08,145 --> 00:54:11,815
don't put any of those        
old cheap moves on me, okay?  
                   No, no, no.

1063
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:17,821
               It's different.
I have all new cheap moves.   

1064
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:19,957
DANA: Hey, you!

1065
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:23,827
Hey, you!         
It looks like     
you're awake, huh?

1066
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:26,563
                 You're awake!
Yes, Osco.                    

1067
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,299
You're gonna             
have the whole place     
to yourself tonight, pal.

1068
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,101
It's gonna be
pretty neat. 

1069
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:35,005
I got some Laura Antonelli   
tapes if you wanna watch 'em.

1070
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:39,443
Dana, did you see some shirts
here in the floor-bed area?  

1071
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,712
Yeah, I put 'em
in the hamper. 

1072
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:44,815
I have a hamper?              
         It's in the bathroom.

1073
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:47,518
Neat.

1074
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:49,653
Will you tell me next time
you're gonna do that,     
though, please?           

1075
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,822
Well, I thought 
they were dirty.

1076
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:54,825
(CHUCKLES)                 
I have more than two grades
of laundry, okay?          

1077
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:56,426
There's not just
clean and dirty,

1078
00:54:56,493 --> 00:55:02,099
there are many      
subtle levels, okay?

1079
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:04,034
You hang this outside     
the window for 20 minutes,

1080
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:06,470
it's perfectly fine.

1081
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:13,477
Interesting role model
for you, Oscar, huh?  

1082
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:18,949
Well, they couldn't get to you
until after the new year.     

1083
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,985
Well, just        
don't go in there.

1084
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:27,591
Louis, I'm closing up.

1085
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:30,861
I don't know,             
should I take the subway, 
or surface roads, or what?

1086
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:35,566
It's kind of busy out.        
            Well, I'm walking.
            Good night.       

1087
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:39,236
Well now, well, well,
well, hang on, now.  

1088
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:42,406
Do you maybe wanna...

there may even be a huge surge

I was protecting myself.

1224
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:46,456
I mean, you weren't        
very good for me, you know.

don't you?    

1226
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,694
Hmm. Well, heck. 
I'm not even good
for me.          

1227
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,595
You're much better
than you realize.

enough credit.

that kind of stuff.

1230
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:04,040
I could have myself        
whipped into shape         
by the end of this century.

1231
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:11,314
Well, why don't you  
just give me a jingle
in the year 2000?    

1232
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:19,989
Why don't I give you
a jingle right now? 

1233
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:24,160
So the seven little dwarves 
had a limited partnership   
in a small mining operation.

1234
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:27,397
One day, a beautiful princess
came to live with them.      

1235
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:29,299
They bartered housekeeping  
services for room and board,

1236
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:31,701
which was a real good deal
for them, because they    
didn't have to withhold   

1237
01:04:31,768 --> 01:04:33,636
social security or income tax
or nothin',                  

1238
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,138
which you're really not 
supposed to do, you see,

1239
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,407
but for the purposes
of this story,      
I think, it's okay. 

1240
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:39,709
This really is
a great place.

1241
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:41,811
I mean, it needs
a woman's touch,

1242
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:48,251
        but I think it looks  
        really good, you know.
Shh, bedtime.                 

1243
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:50,453
You're very good
with children.  

1244

on my hamster.

So, you live alone?

1247

but my mom moved to Florida.

to each other?

Being miserable and treating
other people like dirt      

1368
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:29,318

a big mistake, Mr. Mayor!

the newspapers with this,

1377
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:56,479
would you consider telling 
this slime business to some
of our people downtown?

under strict observation     
for the next few days.

seriously disturbed       
and potentially dangerous.

of Carpathia...

The scourge.

1397
01:12:58,641 --> 01:13:00,509

1398
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:05,348
Uh, this woman, Dana,
is fine and strong.

Now,

01:13:07,283 --> 01:13:11,888
if I was to, uh,

1401
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:18,160
bring the baby,         
could I have that woman?

01:20:19,048 --> 01:20:21,517
Wait a second.      
What was chasing you
in the park?        

1490
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:23,986
The park bench  
was chasing you?
I see.          

1491
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:26,188
What? Wait a sec.

1492
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:28,857
Lieutenant, I think you 
better talk to this guy.

1493
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:30,359
I'm busy here!

1494
01:20:30,426 --> 01:20:32,995
It's some dock supervisor
down at pier 34.         

1495
01:20:33,062 --> 01:20:34,463
What's the problem?

1496
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:45,574
He says the  <i>Titanic</i>
just arrived.       

1497
01:20:45,641 --> 01:20:52,414
Well, better late
than never.      

1498
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:53,982
Battery is swamped!

1499
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:56,485
We've had                 
more than 3,000 calls     
since midnight last night!

1500
01:20:56,552 --> 01:20:58,787
We've got every man       
in uniform on the streets,

1501
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,556
and I am still
shorthanded.  

1502
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:02,524
We got meter maids
chasing ghosts    
all over midtown. 

1503
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:05,194
There's this shell thing over
the Manhattan museum of art. 

1504
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:06,729
We can't make a dent.

1505
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:08,464
Have you tried dynamite?

1506
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,233
We've tried everything.    
            What the hell's
            going on?      

1507
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,202
It's pandemonium out there!

1508
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,603
Yes, I know.        
We're working on it.

1509
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:16,105
Great.                     
While you're working on it,

1510
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:18,140
I'm going down         
in history as the mayor
who let New York       

1511
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:21,110
get sucked down              
into the tenth level of hell.

1512
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:23,612
All right.            
We've got no choice.  
Call the Ghostbusters.

1513
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:25,347
Wait!

1514
01:21:25,414 --> 01:21:28,250
Now, I'm sure       
there's another way.

1515
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:31,487
Jack, I spent an hour   
last night in my bedroom

1516
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,355
talking to          
Fiorello La Guardia,

1517
01:21:33,422 --> 01:21:36,091
and he's been dead
for 40 years!     

1518
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:40,796
Now, where are   
the Ghostbusters?

1519
01:21:40,863 --> 01:21:42,531
They're not available.

1520
01:21:42,598 --> 01:21:46,001
What do you mean,     
they're not available?

1521
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:47,469
Well, I had   
them committed

1522
01:21:47,536 --> 01:21:51,540
to the psychiatric ward
at Parkview hospital.  

1523
01:21:51,607 --> 01:21:54,109
   You what?         
They were threatening
to go to the press.  

1524
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,744
I was protecting
your interests! 

1525
01:21:55,811 --> 01:21:58,881
Oh, yeah?               
Well you can stop       
protecting my interests.

1526
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:02,317
You have exactly three minutes
to clear out. You're fired!   

1527
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:04,153
           But the election!
Harry!                      

1528
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:05,854
Remove this man               
from the building!            
      You're making a mistake.

1529
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,123
And get me the Ghostbusters!

1530
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:10,959
MAN: Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor!
Come take a look at this. 

1531
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:15,798
Wow, what is it?

1532
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:19,501
Have you ever seen 
anything like that?

1533
01:22:19,568 --> 01:22:32,815
(RUMBLING)

1534
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:35,317
Somebody get me  
the Ghostbusters!

1535
01:22:35,384 --> 01:22:37,886
And then he took the baby,  
and he put it in a carriage,

1536
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,721
and then levitated away!

1537
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,190
What did Dana do?
Where did she go?

1538
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:43,125
She said she was   
going to the museum
to get the baby!   

1539
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:44,526
And then there was
an eclipse,       

1540
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:47,563
and the whole town went dark,
and everybody's nuts!        

1541
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:50,499
See, it all fits.   
Vigo wants in       
on the 21st century.

1542
01:22:50,566 --> 01:22:52,935
He needs                
a human body to inhabit.
Little Oscar must be it.

a giant Jell-O mold!

1555

I hate Jell-O.

Soon it will be midnight,

1558
01:23:44,987 --> 01:23:49,424
and the city will be mine
and Vigo's!              

1559
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:51,693
Well, mainly Vigo's.

1560
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,595
Oh, Dana,

1561
01:23:53,662 --> 01:23:55,731
you and I have this 
terrific opportunity

1562

to make the best     
of this relationship.

1563
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:00,235
We don't have  
a relationship.

1564
01:24:00,302 --> 01:24:03,171
I know!        
Marry me, Dana!

1565
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:08,210
Together, we will raise
Vigo as our son!       

1566
01:24:08,277 --> 01:24:10,712
And let me tell you something,
here.                         

1567
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:15,017
There are many perks in being
the mother of a living god.  

1568
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:18,453
I'm sure we could get   
a magnificent apartment,

1569
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:22,558
a car, free parking...

1570
01:24:22,624 --> 01:24:26,628

with a certain amount
of distance,         

1571
01:24:26,695 --> 01:24:34,703
but I think that     
you and I could learn
to love each other.  

1572
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:37,639
Yes.

1573
01:24:37,706 --> 01:24:50,185
I could learn.

1574
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:53,589

That slime wall is
pulsing with evil!

1581
01:25:28,023 --> 01:25:30,792
It would take a tremendous
amount of positive energy 
to crack that shell,      

1582
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:35,731

there's enough good will   
left in this town to do it.

1583

I just can't believe
things have gotten  
so bad in this city

that there's no way back!

1585

I mean, sure, it's dirty,   
it's crowded, it's polluted,

1586
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,006
