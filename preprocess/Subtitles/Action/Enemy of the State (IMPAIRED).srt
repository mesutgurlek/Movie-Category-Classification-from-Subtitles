let me know.

This is not the office!

- This is my private time.
- Five minutes.

No! I said no Tuesday,
I said no last week,

00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:14,368
and I'm gonna keep sayin' no
till you hear me.

11
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,237
Five minutes,
Mr. Chairman.

- It's all I ask. Five minutes.

- No, I don't want any coffee. I want to play with my dog.

14
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:28,351
Look, I'm not asking you
to vote for it.

nation on earth, and therefore the most hated.

And you and I know what
the average citizen does not:

30
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:13,455
That we are at war
24 hours of every day.

or greater than whatever those
companies gave your last campaign.

now we got Pintero's goons...

down there
tuning up my people.

Well, first off, that's a Hobbs Act
violation, probably a RICO.

- Hey, thanks. Great.
- How you doing, Eddie? How's it goin'?

- Robert Dean.
- Tony O'Neill. Nice to meet you.

Ooh, baby, don't stop.

We were in Louie's
two nights ago,

I go to use the bathroom,
and these two fuckin' guidos jump me.

Uh, I prefer we use the term

and a ruptured kidney.

Wow. That's not exactly
the answer I was hoping for.

off of my shoulders.

specifically forbid you from having any contact...

Eloquently? That's not me.

Oh, that's not you. Well, I'm sorry
I've wasted your time, gentlemen,

154
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,909
you know, since
that's not you, um...

155
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:37,551
Oh, you know what? I'm thinkin'.
Maybe I'll just, you know,

156
00:11:37,627 --> 00:11:39,720
run this tape past
the federal prosecutor.

157
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:42,696
You know, they have
really great VCRs down there.

158
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:45,427
A lot of times, they can see
things that we can't see.

159
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:48,265
You ain't runnin' this
by nobody.

160
00:11:50,473 --> 00:11:55,103
- What do you want?
- My clients want to vote their contract up or down...

161
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:59,171
as they see fit, without,
shall we say, any outside influences.

162
00:11:59,248 --> 00:12:02,240
Okay.
Sit down.

163
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:04,912
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- No, you are not fine.

00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:08,787
Now sit your ass...
down.

165
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:22,570
I would like my clients to be able
to exercise their constitutional rights.

166
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:26,301
And if that happens, that tape will
disappear forever into my private collection,

167
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:31,278
along with the Zapruder film
and the porno from Hitler's bunker.

may save your clients' asses,

it ain't gonna save yours.

the Lockraven Reservoir right now...

195
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,091
where police and fire officials
are in the process of removing...

196
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,924
a classic Mercedes owned by
Republican congressman...

197

Phillip Hamersly
of Syracuse, New York.

198
00:14:30,398 --> 00:14:33,890
[Woman #2] This accident comes
at a very untimely juncture,

199
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:37,699
since the congressman was working on a
controversial piece of legislation, Dale,

200
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:41,264
opposing the Telecommunications
Security and Privacy Act.

201
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:44,608
Fire officials do tell me
that it appears the congressman...

202
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,613
was by himself
in the car.

203
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:49,275
We have confirmed that.
However, strangely enough,

204
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:52,752
his favorite dog, Bob,
is currently with police.

205

[Woman #1] I understand there
was a history of heart problems.

206
00:14:54,823 --> 00:14:56,848
[Woman #2] There was, in fact,
a history of heart problems.

207
00:14:56,925 --> 00:15:00,417
In fact, the congressman endured open-heart
surgery just a couple of years ago.

208
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:05,762
Homicide investigators have told me they
did find a bottle of pills in his lap.

209
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:08,200
That might mean that the congressman...
and I speculate here...

210
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:12,603
may have suffered a heart attack before
going into the Lockraven Reservoir.

211

He leaves behind
a family of four.

- Bobby!
- I mean, who is this idiot?

429
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:46,409

- He's dead.

00:30:39,698 --> 00:30:43,657
- He got hit by a fire engine pretty much in front of my eyes.
- My God!

446
00:30:43,735 --> 00:30:47,193
I ran into him in a store,
and he was upset about something.

447
00:30:47,272 --> 00:30:49,433
- About what?
- I don't know.

448
00:30:49,508 --> 00:30:52,636
Before we had a chance to talk about it,
he ran out of the store,

449
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:54,702
and next time I saw him,
he was dead.

450
00:30:56,682 --> 00:30:59,515
Baby!
Come here.

451
00:30:59,585 --> 00:31:03,180
Ohh, I love you
so much!

452
00:31:03,255 --> 00:31:05,450
I love you, too,
sweetie.

453
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:10,728
That's not even to mention the gangster
that threatened to kill me today.

454
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:13,458
- Hah! Very funny!
- Oh, you think?

455
00:31:13,532 --> 00:31:17,093
- Hilarious.
- Mmm. What'd you get me?

456
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:19,296
A bowling ball.

457
00:31:19,371 --> 00:31:22,568
No more of that MSNBC terrorist talk.
You're scaring the kids.

458
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:26,202
We'll be back with your phone calls for
Congressman Sam Albert right after this.

459
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:31,241
- Tell me.
- Zavitz is dead. So is Lenny, the guy from the paper.

460
00:31:31,316 --> 00:31:34,012
- What about the tape?
- We found the original in Zavitz's apartment.

461
00:31:34,086 --> 00:31:36,020
- The original?
- There was a copy.

462
00:31:36,088 --> 00:31:38,556
- There was a copy?
- I think so, sir.

463
00:31:38,624 --> 00:31:41,354
- Any more good news?
- They never made it to the paper, but there was a private contact.

464
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:44,156
- Who was that?
- Several indiscriminants and one primary.

465
00:31:44,229 --> 00:31:46,163
- Who?
- Robert Dean, a D.C. Labor lawyer.

466
00:31:46,231 --> 00:31:49,359
Lives in Georgetown with his wife,
Carla Dean. She's also an attorney.

467
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:52,335
She's with the A.C.L.U.,
as it happens.

468
00:31:52,404 --> 00:31:54,531
I suppose he could've given it
directly to Bob Woodward.

469
00:31:54,606 --> 00:31:59,043
Maybe we dodged a bullet.
Find out what Dean knows.

470
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:01,170
Make contact.

471
00:32:01,246 --> 00:32:04,238
- Yes, sir.
- I hate doing this at Christmas.

472
00:32:08,453 --> 00:32:11,547
[Hicks] Fiedler,
we need a complete FinCEN, EPIC...

473
00:32:11,623 --> 00:32:13,921
and a DRD work-up
on a Robert Clayton Dean.

474
00:32:13,992 --> 00:32:18,952
His social's 986-26-0901.
Pull up keyhole data files, okay?

475
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:22,364
Let's go!
Let's get this show on the road!

476
00:32:22,434 --> 00:32:26,461
Eric, just call me in the morning
when you want me to come pick you up.

477
00:32:26,538 --> 00:32:28,836
You know, if you decide
you want to stay at Dylan's...

478
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:33,435
till the end of the weekend or the end of
the century, your mom and I have discussed it.

479
00:32:33,512 --> 00:32:37,141
It'll be difficult initially,
but we think we can live with it.

480
00:32:37,215 --> 00:32:40,480
Dad's kidding.
He's gonna miss you, just like me.

481
00:32:40,552 --> 00:32:42,543
[Panting]

482
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:44,885
Honey, hurry back.

483
00:32:44,956 --> 00:32:48,756
- You know what that means. - Mmm-hmm.
That you're gonna be asleep when I get back.

484
00:32:48,827 --> 00:32:51,660
That only happened
one time, sweetie.

485
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,597
[Fiedler] We're running
a comprehensive database search.

486
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:57,658
Brian did a preliminary
analysis and comparison,

487
00:32:57,736 --> 00:33:00,398
and he came up with
some pretty interesting stuff.

488
00:33:03,408 --> 00:33:06,138
Thanks, Brian.

489
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:08,839
Thank you.

490
00:33:08,914 --> 00:33:12,145
Prioritize his phone bill.

491
00:33:12,217 --> 00:33:14,913
Who's he been calling?

492
00:33:16,722 --> 00:33:19,020
- Oh, man. Check this one.
- Who?

493
00:33:19,091 --> 00:33:22,959
Rachel F-for-you-know-what Banks. God,
would I love to have her ruin my life.

494
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:24,928
Do a cross.

495
00:33:24,996 --> 00:33:27,931
They were at Georgetown
together, sophomore year.

496
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:30,934
They have the same address,
same phone number.

497
00:33:31,002 --> 00:33:33,869
They remain close. Many calls,
regardless of marriage.

498
00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:38,333
- [Fiedler] Oh, here we go.
- [Hicks] What?

499
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,708
Dean, over the past
18 months,

500
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:45,273
has four, five, seven cash
withdrawals of 4,000, 5,000,

501
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,841
and up, and up,

502
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,853
and each time,

503
00:33:49,921 --> 00:33:53,322
the delectable Miss Banks makes large cash
deposits of her own within a day or two.

504
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:56,087
- Blackmail?
- Well, her deposits aren't the same,

505
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:58,527
but let me figure this out.

506
00:33:58,597 --> 00:34:00,462
- [Beeping]
- Oh, yes, they're exactly...

507
00:34:00,532 --> 00:34:03,467
exactly 15% of the amount
Dean withdrew.

508
00:34:03,535 --> 00:34:06,368
Brian, can we get some more?
[Whistles]

509
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:10,636
I mean, you know, we got the blimp cam,
we got the police officer cam,

510
00:34:10,709 --> 00:34:15,373
we've got two A.T.M. Cameras,
but this is the one showing promise.

511
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:18,974
This is the security camera
at the underwear store. Freeze there.

512
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:23,009
- [Computer Beeps]
- Rotate us 75 degrees around the vertical, please.

513
00:34:23,088 --> 00:34:25,886
Freeze there.
Times ten.

514
00:34:25,957 --> 00:34:28,357
- [Tapping At Keyboard]
- [Beeping]

515
00:34:28,426 --> 00:34:30,417
Focus on the drop.

516
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:35,426
Enhance, then forward
frame-by-frame.

517
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,562
All right. Now, just before the view's
blocked, there's a shape change in Dean's bag.

518
00:34:42,641 --> 00:34:44,905
See the shadow variance?
See?

519
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:48,844
The shadow's wrong. Zavitz changed
the configuration of Dean's packages.

520
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:53,442
- Is it a tape?
- It's hard to say for sure. These things are...

521
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:56,976
- Can the computer take us around to the other side?
- It can hypothesize. Chris?

522
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:59,023
- Yeah?
- Can you rotate us...

523
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,217
75 degrees around
the vertical, please?

524
00:35:02,627 --> 00:35:04,527
[Beeps]

525
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:08,259
- What do you think it is?
- It looks a lot bigger than a tape.

526
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:10,358
Zavitz had digital compression
equipment in his apartment.

527
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:12,369
He could've downloaded it
to anything.

528
00:35:12,437 --> 00:35:14,405
Or maybe the bag twisted
in Dean's hand.

529
00:35:14,472 --> 00:35:18,203
Or something moved in front of the light
and altered the shadow. Maybe it's nothing.

530
00:35:18,276 --> 00:35:21,370
Maybe it's everything.
Let's get it and find out.

531
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:26,313
- Beat it. I got work to do.
- [Barking]

532
00:35:26,384 --> 00:35:29,319
Go. Porsche!

533
00:35:30,288 --> 00:35:32,518
Ohh!

534
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:35,219
- [Doorbell Chimes]
- Go away!

535
00:35:35,293 --> 00:35:37,955
- [Porsche Barking]
- Damn it, Porsche!

536
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:41,588
- Hello, Mr. Dean?
- Uh, yes. Can I help you?

537
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:45,158
This is Detective Benning.
I'm Pratt. We're with D.C. Metro.

538
00:35:45,237 --> 00:35:47,228
- Shh.
- Uh, sorry to bother you at home, sir.

539
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:49,637
We were hoping to ask you
a few questions about Daniel Zavitz.

540
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:52,506
- Wh... I'm s... Can I see your badges, please?
- Certainly, sir.

541
00:35:52,577 --> 00:35:53,908
[Benning]
Sure.

542
00:35:56,214 --> 00:35:58,774
All right. Come on.
Back up, Porsche.

543
00:36:02,754 --> 00:36:04,949
- All right. Nice and smooth. Come on.
- Okay.

544
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:07,821
I didn't really see the accident.
I don't know whose fault it was.

545
00:36:07,892 --> 00:36:10,690
- We're not here to talk about the accident, Mr. Dean.
- I'm sorry, I thought you said...

546
00:36:10,762 --> 00:36:13,663
[Pratt] We should apologize
for the confusion, sir.

547
00:36:13,732 --> 00:36:16,132
It's just that we're handling
a different aspect of the inquiry.

548
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:19,932
It turns out Mr. Zavitz was
involved in an extortion scheme.

549
00:36:20,005 --> 00:36:23,805
- What kind of watch is that?
- It's an Omega.

550
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:26,639
- So you're not constrained by
attorney-client privilege? - [Barking]

551
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:29,475
- Shh-shh. Yeah, that's correct.
- You see, Mr. Dean,

552
00:36:29,547 --> 00:36:33,039
we have reason to believe that Mr. Zavitz
may have passed sensitive materials to you.

553
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:35,643
- [Growls]
- What kind of materials?

554
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,450
[Pratt, Over Speaker] Well, sensitive,
so we were hoping you could tell us that.

555
00:36:38,523 --> 00:36:41,686
[Dean Sighs]
No, he didn't pass me anything.

556
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,354
These voice stress points indicate
a really high degree of anxiety.

557
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:46,954
Anxiety about what?

558
00:36:47,032 --> 00:36:51,731
That's the nature of physics. If he'd
given me something, I would've known.

559
00:36:51,803 --> 00:36:55,068
- Oh, he's lying!
- What about your packages, sir?

560
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,836
Could something have slipped in amongst
the purchases without your knowledge?

561
00:36:57,909 --> 00:37:01,367
Excuse me. Daniel Zavitz
did not give me anything.

562
00:37:01,446 --> 00:37:04,540
- That's a Parker pen.
- It's a Mont Blanc.

563
00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:07,813
He didn't secrete it
into any of my bodily orifices.

564
00:37:07,886 --> 00:37:10,411
- Whatever it is, I don't have it.
- Could we look at them?

565
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:12,649
I don't think so.
Not without a warrant.

566
00:37:12,724 --> 00:37:15,386
- Oh, Christ.
- This guy's good.

567
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,588
- How did you happen to be at Ruby's today?
- I was shopping for lingerie.

568
00:37:18,663 --> 00:37:21,063
- That's still legal, isn't it?
- You buying that for your wife?

569
00:37:21,132 --> 00:37:23,430
No, I was, uh,
picking something up for myself.

570
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:26,732
I do a little cross-dressing on the
weekends. You know, you'd be surprised...

571
00:37:26,805 --> 00:37:29,774
how a nice pair of edible panties
can make a guy feel sexy.

572
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:33,038
We thought it might be
for Rachel Banks.

573
00:37:33,111 --> 00:37:36,410
Good night, gentlemen.

574
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:39,712
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Mr. Dean.

575
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:42,953
[Porsche Growls, Barks]

576
00:37:57,669 --> 00:38:01,127
What are they talking about, Porsche?
There's nothing here.

577
00:38:07,645 --> 00:38:09,806
Honey, I'm home.

578
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:13,317
- [Door Shuts]
- Uh, yeah, just a second, sweetie.

579
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:24,990
Well, either he's getting ready to do
something with it, or he doesn't know he has it.

580
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:28,361
Or he doesn't have it.

581
00:38:28,432 --> 00:38:32,835
You know what I've seen?
I've seen killers walk free...

582
00:38:32,903 --> 00:38:35,804
because the eyewitness
was an alcoholic.

583
00:38:35,873 --> 00:38:39,309
I've seen sex offenders that couldn't be
touched because the victim was a call girl.

584
00:38:39,376 --> 00:38:44,939
Credibility... It's the only currency that
means anything on this kind of playing field.

585
00:38:45,015 --> 00:38:47,074
Dean's got the tape,
and he's gonna come out with it.

586
00:38:47,151 --> 00:38:49,779
And when he does,
I want his credibility.

587
00:38:49,854 --> 00:38:52,186
I want people to know he's lying
before they hear what he says.

588
00:38:52,256 --> 00:38:54,588
We could take his wife and kid.
He'd give it up for them.

589
00:38:54,658 --> 00:38:58,219
We'd have the police and the F.B.I.
All over this in 24 hours.

590
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:01,696
Put taps on his 20 most frequently called
numbers, and let's get into his life.

591
00:39:01,765 --> 00:39:04,700
The union situation has-has mob
written all over it.

592
00:39:04,768 --> 00:39:06,929
And he's definitely vulnerable
on Rachel Banks.

593
00:39:07,004 --> 00:39:09,529
I want to know about his wife,
I want to know about his parents,

594
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:12,337
I want to know about his gambling problems,
his urine samples, his porno rentals.

595
00:39:12,409 --> 00:39:14,775
I want to use every means possible
to get what we need.

596
00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:18,372
Because this little son of a bitch is not
going to be the final chapter of my life.

597
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:26,783
- [Carla] Tell me something.
- [Dean] Uh-oh.

598
00:39:26,857 --> 00:39:29,951
How did you find out Pintero
was associated with union officials?

599
00:39:30,027 --> 00:39:32,552
I'm just that good.

600
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,224
I hired an investigator.

601
00:39:45,209 --> 00:39:48,372
- Hey.
- Shut up the dog!

602
00:39:48,445 --> 00:39:50,379
My mom used to have
one of these. Come on.

603
00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:52,415
Ow!
The dog bit me!

604
00:39:52,483 --> 00:39:56,681
- Who was the investigator?
- Wh-What do you mean? His name?

605
00:39:56,754 --> 00:40:00,656
Come on, Bobby. You know what I'm
asking. Is it the guy who Rachel knows?

606
00:40:02,826 --> 00:40:04,919
Why do... Why do we have to go
through this every time?

607
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:07,225
- Baby, I'm just asking, okay?
- Carla,

608
00:40:07,298 --> 00:40:09,926
Rachel Banks is not
an issue anymore.

609
00:40:25,182 --> 00:40:27,776
You are the only woman
in the world for me.

610
00:40:29,486 --> 00:40:31,750
You and Janet Jackson.

611
00:40:31,822 --> 00:40:36,691
- [Scoffs] - I have to be honest.
If-If Janet Jackson called me,

612
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,752
I w... I might have to change
my last name to Jackson.

613
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,960
- Yeah, right. I'd have to break that woman's legs too.
- [Dean Snickering]

614
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:47,435
[Camera Shutter Clicking]

615
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:55,938
- Lower, like kids would do it.
- You sound like a fuckin' old lady. Shut up.

616
00:40:56,013 --> 00:40:59,244
Ooh, sensitive.

617
00:40:59,316 --> 00:41:01,580
Jones has some issues
we need to resolve.

618
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:07,117
- Oh. Control, they are home.
- Uh-oh.

619
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,396
Move, guys.

620
00:41:15,466 --> 00:41:17,491
Oh, nice blender.

621
00:41:23,841 --> 00:41:26,401
Oh, my God.

622
00:41:28,846 --> 00:41:32,145
- [Barking]
- [Carla] Oh, Porsche.

623
00:41:32,216 --> 00:41:34,810
Shh.

624
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:38,184
Oh, damn.
The dog is green.

625
00:41:38,255 --> 00:41:41,816
[Chuckles]
Jones painted the... the dog!

626
00:41:41,892 --> 00:41:45,259
This is Robert Dean, 2811 Sutton.
I'd like to report a break-in.

627
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:48,924
I don't know. It's been vandalized.
From the looks of it, i-it's kids,

628
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:50,967
but I need
a squad car here immediately.

629
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:55,904
[Siren Wailing]

630
00:41:59,743 --> 00:42:01,677
Here we go.

631
00:42:01,745 --> 00:42:03,975
We'll be checking out the rest
of the house, sir, ma'am.

632
00:42:10,387 --> 00:42:14,016
At least
they left me one.

633
00:42:18,062 --> 00:42:20,462
How do you know
it wasn't Pintero?

634
00:42:20,531 --> 00:42:24,058
I don't. It was just
kind of frivolous.

635
00:42:24,134 --> 00:42:27,297
I guess I'm just hopin'
it was kids.

636
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,671
John.

637
00:42:49,593 --> 00:42:51,891
What have we here?

638
00:42:54,865 --> 00:42:57,766
I think we have
a winner.

639
00:42:57,835 --> 00:43:00,269
Phone for phone.

640
00:43:00,337 --> 00:43:02,567
[Man]
Take any of your clothes?

641
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,268
No, they threw all my shoes
and suits in the tub,

642
00:43:06,343 --> 00:43:08,368
and spray painted
my damn dog.

643
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:11,243
- Black.
- Black.

644
00:43:11,315 --> 00:43:14,216
Perfect.
How does that look?

645
00:43:14,284 --> 00:43:16,912
Paging Mr. Dean.

646
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:19,581
We have you bugged,
Mr. Dean.

647
00:43:19,656 --> 00:43:24,593
They thrashed my computers, my
big-screen TV... They took my blender.

648
00:43:24,661 --> 00:43:27,186
- What about jewelry?
- Nope.

649
00:43:27,264 --> 00:43:30,597
- What about silverware?
- Nope. Just my blender.

650
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:34,125
- Blender, huh?
- Loved that blender.

651
00:43:34,204 --> 00:43:37,139
You know, I did stuff
when I was a kid.

652
00:43:37,207 --> 00:43:39,402
I mean, not breaking-and-entering,
but, you know, stuff.

653
00:43:39,476 --> 00:43:43,572
Yeah, we all did stuff. I just wish
they hadn't stolen my damn blender.

654
00:43:43,647 --> 00:43:46,548
You seem a little attached
to this blender, Robert.

655
00:43:46,617 --> 00:43:50,314
Yeah, well, some people meditate,
some people get massages.

656
00:43:50,387 --> 00:43:54,448
- I blend.
- You're really weird, you know that?

657
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:59,428
Yeah, then on top of it, the only suit
they leave me is three years old.

658
00:43:59,496 --> 00:44:01,760
Hasn't gotten any better
with age.

659
00:44:04,168 --> 00:44:07,194
[Dean] Blow over? I'm not gonna sit
around and wait for this to blow over!

660
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:11,401
Jerry, I-I'm suing their right-wing
asses right into Chapter 11!

661
00:44:11,475 --> 00:44:14,239
This is flagrant! They never even called
to see what my side of the story was!

662
00:44:14,311 --> 00:44:16,939
- [Knock At Door]
- They have no Sullivan protection with this!

663
00:44:17,014 --> 00:44:19,949
- Mr. Dean, Rachel Banks is on line one.
- Yes.

664
00:44:20,017 --> 00:44:22,815
And Silverberg and Blake would like
to see you in the conference room.

665
00:44:22,886 --> 00:44:25,855
Uh, Jerry,
I got to take this call. All right.

666
00:44:25,923 --> 00:44:27,857
Hey, what's up?

667
00:44:27,925 --> 00:44:30,519
My firm called me this morning
telling me not to come in.

668
00:44:30,594 --> 00:44:32,892
- What? Why not?
- I don't know.

669
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:36,160
Reporters are calling, asking me
about my relationship with you...

670
00:44:36,233 --> 00:44:38,929
and how long
I've worked for the mob.

671
00:44:39,002 --> 00:44:41,664
- The mob, Bobby.
- Jesus.

672
00:44:41,738 --> 00:44:45,469
- Do you know how hard I worked to get this job?
- Yeah, I know. I know.

673
00:44:45,542 --> 00:44:48,773
Mr. Dean, Silverberg and Blake are still
waiting to see you in the conference room.

674
00:44:48,846 --> 00:44:52,043
- I heard you the first time. Thank you.
- You got your own problems.

675
00:44:52,115 --> 00:44:54,345
- Uh, no, Rachel. It's fine.
- [Phone Hangs Up]

676
00:44:54,418 --> 00:44:56,613
Oh, damn it!

677
00:45:03,126 --> 00:45:05,686
I just got off the phone
with a source that I trust.

678
00:45:05,762 --> 00:45:09,994
A grand jury is being convened
to look into your labor practice...

679
00:45:10,067 --> 00:45:12,058
as far back as the
electrical workers' strike.

680
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:14,865
And why is that?

681
00:45:14,938 --> 00:45:18,305
They claim you helped create a shell
company for Sam Villotti in Zurich.

682
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:22,368
And through your continuing relationship,
the Peitso family has been able...

683
00:45:22,446 --> 00:45:26,974
to exert influence and provide
false witness to discredit our case.

684
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,644
- Oh, well, that's true.
- You're admitting it?

685
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,657
Sure. Everything except
setting up a company in Zurich.

686
00:45:34,725 --> 00:45:36,693
Or even knowing anyone
named Sam Villotti.

687
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,991
Or having any relationship whatsoever
to the Peitso family!

688
00:45:40,063 --> 00:45:41,997
This is ridiculous!

689
00:45:42,065 --> 00:45:43,794
- Robert...
- Mark, I'm telling you.

690
00:45:43,867 --> 00:45:45,698
This is Pintero.
He's coming back after me.

691
00:45:45,769 --> 00:45:48,795
You give me one week... one week
and four guys from litigation,

692
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:51,739
and I guarantee you,
we'll have this guy begging us...

693
00:45:51,808 --> 00:45:54,242
Tell us
about Rachel Banks.

694
00:45:57,047 --> 00:46:01,074
Tell you what? Uh, she was my
girlfriend the second year of law school.

695
00:46:01,151 --> 00:46:03,249
We keep in touch. We-We toss one another
some work every once in awhile. That's it.

696
00:46:03,284 --> 00:46:05,347
We keep in touch. We-We toss one another
some work every once in awhile. That's it.

697
00:46:05,422 --> 00:46:08,755
Did you have an affair
with her four years ago?

698
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:13,095
You ever beat off
in the shower, Brian?

699
00:46:13,163 --> 00:46:16,257
Hmm? You ever have
any homosexual thoughts?

700
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:20,793
- Bobby, that is...
- None of my fucking business! You're damn right it's not!

701
00:46:20,871 --> 00:46:23,635
I love my wife,
and I love my son...

702
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:27,939
absolutely, with no equivocations, and
that's none of your fuckin' business either.

703
00:46:28,012 --> 00:46:31,004
Uh, we think that you
should take a leave of absence...

704
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:33,242
until we're able
to, uh, sort all this out.

705
00:46:33,317 --> 00:46:36,309
- Are you firing me?
- I think you just fired yourself.

706
00:46:47,164 --> 00:46:49,098
Carla!

707
00:46:51,969 --> 00:46:54,563
Where is she, Jen?

708
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,508
Don't go in there.
She doesn't want to talk to you.

709
00:46:58,575 --> 00:47:00,975
- Why not?
- Because she's reading the paper.

710
00:47:04,982 --> 00:47:06,950
Asshole.

711
00:47:07,017 --> 00:47:09,781
Carla...

712
00:47:09,853 --> 00:47:12,151
How could you let me
find out like this?

713
00:47:12,222 --> 00:47:16,283
I'm findin' out like this. This is
all lies. None of this stuff is true.

714
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,453
So you're saying
you weren't there with her?

715
00:47:18,529 --> 00:47:20,759
Yes, I had lunch with her.
We have lunch once a month.

716
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:24,096
She's the contact for the investigator,
Brill. You were right about that.

717
00:47:24,168 --> 00:47:27,763
Someone must have taken this picture off
the security camera outside the restaurant.

718
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:30,136
- You said she wasn't an issue.
- She's not!

719
00:47:30,207 --> 00:47:33,699
I have to see her for business.
And I knew if I told you that...

720
00:47:33,777 --> 00:47:36,507
Bobby, you had an affair
with this woman! An affair.

721
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,548
We went to a counselor
for a year!

722
00:47:38,615 --> 00:47:41,948
And now you're standin' there
lyin' about even seein' her?

723
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:44,954
You make me sick!

724
00:47:45,022 --> 00:47:50,961
Carla, I am smeared all over the newspapers for money
- laundering schemes, mob ties...

725
00:47:51,028 --> 00:47:54,088
I lost my job.
I am asking you.

726
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:58,533
I am asking you to please just trust me
on this Rachel Banks thing right now.

727
00:47:58,602 --> 00:48:01,469
How in God's name
can I trust you?

728
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:03,563
Bobby, I want you
to leave.

729
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,733
Carla, I'm telling you
that this is all bullshit!

730
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:07,743
I don't want
to hear anything else.

731
00:48:07,811 --> 00:48:10,712
I cannot think with you in my face.
I want you to leave.

732
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:13,079
What do you need to think about?
I'm telling you it's bullshit!

733
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,914
Just leave, so I can think!
For me, okay? Just leave.

734
00:48:15,986 --> 00:48:18,853
Just go, Bobby.
Go.

735
00:48:18,922 --> 00:48:20,651
Go!

736
00:48:23,093 --> 00:48:26,324
- You want a blend?
- Yeah.

737
00:48:26,397 --> 00:48:29,650
Thanks.

738
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:40,044
- Hi.
- Hi. I'd like to have a room for the evening, please.

739
00:48:40,177 --> 00:48:43,408
Okay.
Thank you.

740
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:48,844
- [Computer Beeps]
- [Woman] I'm sorry, sir. This card was declined.

741
00:48:48,919 --> 00:48:51,114
Declined? This is a brand-new card.
Try it again, please.

742
00:48:51,188 --> 00:48:54,351
Yes, sir.

743
00:48:54,425 --> 00:48:57,792
- [Computer Beeps]
- You know, maybe it's not activated yet.

744
00:48:57,861 --> 00:49:00,921
Thank you.
Run this one, please.

745
00:49:00,998 --> 00:49:03,967
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

746
00:49:04,034 --> 00:49:07,299
No, it didn't
go through.

747
00:49:07,371 --> 00:49:09,362
- But I'll try it again.
- No, thank you.

748
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:13,601
- My briefcase is gone.
- Excuse me, sir?

749
00:49:13,677 --> 00:49:16,339
- My briefcase was right here.
- Are you sure you brought it in?

750
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:19,075
Yes, I'm sure
I brought it in!

751
00:49:22,286 --> 00:49:26,313
[On Cell Phone] Hi. This is Rachel.
Leave a message after the beep.

752
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,917
- Hey, Rachel, it's Bobby. I need to talk to you,
- [Beeping]

753
00:49:29,993 --> 00:49:32,621
And I need to talk to you
face-to-face.

754
00:49:32,696 --> 00:49:35,790
Meet me tomorrow, 11:00 a. m.,
Mount Vernon Square. I'll see you then.

755
00:49:35,866 --> 00:49:38,130
Yes.

756
00:49:48,812 --> 00:49:50,746
All right, we're moving into
phase two of the training op.

757
00:49:50,814 --> 00:49:52,839
Selby's gonna brief you on it,
so listen up, okay?

758
00:49:52,916 --> 00:49:55,942
We're gonna be following the subjects
through the square.

759
00:49:56,019 --> 00:49:58,317
We're gonna have three listening stations
and two video surveillance units...

760
00:49:58,388 --> 00:50:00,322
with unidirectional mikes.

761
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,018
Pratt, you're three.
Jones, Fiedler, Krug,

762
00:50:03,093 --> 00:50:06,085
you guys are at ground level.
You'll be following the targets.

763
00:50:06,163 --> 00:50:08,188
You move when I say,
you go when I say.

764
00:50:08,265 --> 00:50:10,927
All handoffs go
on my command.

765
00:50:11,001 --> 00:50:14,129
Now, for the uninitiated,
if we don't have line-of-sight,

766
00:50:14,204 --> 00:50:16,434
we can't hear
what they say, right?

767
00:50:16,507 --> 00:50:18,668
- Right?
- Yeah. Got it.

768
00:50:18,742 --> 00:50:21,836
- All right. You guys clear?
- Yeah.

769
00:50:21,912 --> 00:50:24,176
Jones, Krug, what, are you guys
from communications?

770
00:50:24,248 --> 00:50:27,274
- No, we're ops.
- You can tell by their haircuts.

771
00:50:29,035 --> 00:50:32,061
[Chattering, Indistinct]

772
00:50:35,558 --> 00:50:38,686
I would like to sit down
with Mr. Pintero in private...

773
00:50:38,761 --> 00:50:40,786
so he and I can discuss
what's happening to me.

774
00:50:40,863 --> 00:50:43,127
I called; they said
he was here.

775
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,225
Mr. Pintero would like
to help you.

776
00:50:46,302 --> 00:50:49,032
[Chuckles]
But he won't.

777
00:50:49,105 --> 00:50:52,165
- And why not?
- Well, first, you haven't told him...

778
00:50:52,241 --> 00:50:54,607
who made the tape,
and second,

779
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:58,613
we've spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars...

780
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,081
on shyster lawyers
just like you...

781
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:05,678
because of shyster lawyers
just like you.

782
00:51:05,755 --> 00:51:10,385
Actually, I believe the slur "shyster"
is generally reserved...

783
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,655
for Jewish attorneys.

784
00:51:12,728 --> 00:51:15,629
I believe the proper slur
for someone like myself...

785
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,064
would be, uh,
"eggplant. "

786
00:51:18,134 --> 00:51:21,438
Boom. This kid gets brighter
every time I see him.

787
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,266
[Siren Wailing]

788
00:51:26,075 --> 00:51:28,911
[Rachel]
You said 11:00 sharp.

789
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,773
I know. Uh,
Christmas traffic is horrible.

790
00:51:32,915 --> 00:51:37,511
You know, it's not so smart, us being
seen together in public like this.

791
00:51:37,586 --> 00:51:41,647
- Do we have anything to hide?
- Heavy background on one. Can we do better on two?

792
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,953
- [Rachel] Unfortunately not.
- Two is better.

793
00:51:44,026 --> 00:51:46,927
[Rachel]
The I.R.S. Contacted me this morning.

794
00:51:46,995 --> 00:51:49,691
- Two, you're good. Hold position.
- They say my lifestyle...

795
00:51:49,765 --> 00:51:53,667
- exceeds my income.
- Ohh. You're being audited?

796
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:57,569
For the last four years.
What's going on, Bobby?

797
00:51:57,639 --> 00:52:01,939
Uh, look, don't worry about that. My
firm will represent you free of charge.

798
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:05,639
- [Seth] Eighty percent.
- You don't work there anymore, remember?

799
00:52:05,714 --> 00:52:07,773
It's a temporary
situation.

800
00:52:07,849 --> 00:52:11,444
- Your 80's becoming a 20. Move to audio three.
- On three. Much better.

801
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,886
- [Rachel] We're screwed.
- Wake up, one.

802
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:16,948
[Rachel]
We are out.

803
00:52:17,025 --> 00:52:20,927
Rachel,
I'm going to fix this.

804
00:52:20,996 --> 00:52:22,964
- How?
- Tell me about Brill.

805
00:52:23,031 --> 00:52:26,990
- Did he say "Bill"? - No, "Brill,"
with an "R." - I can't do that.

806
00:52:27,069 --> 00:52:29,936
- Cross-reference Rachel's file.
See if "Brill" comes up. - Got it.

807
00:52:30,005 --> 00:52:33,736
Rachel, don't you see that he
is the key to this whole mess?

808
00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:37,404
From the second you gave me that tape,
my life has been falling apart.

809
00:52:37,479 --> 00:52:39,674
You assured me
that this-this guy was legit.

810
00:52:39,748 --> 00:52:42,080
- You needed information; I got it for you.
- Two, you're good.

811
00:52:43,418 --> 00:52:47,320
- Three is good.
- This conversation is over.

812
00:52:47,389 --> 00:52:50,552
- [Dean Stammering]
- Okay, here we go.

813
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,253
- [Dean Continues, Indistinct]
- Two, you gotta do better.

814
00:52:53,328 --> 00:52:55,319
- Shit.
- You want your life back?

815
00:52:55,397 --> 00:52:58,628
I don't have
a life.

816
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,895
I'm in love
with a married man.

817
00:53:06,174 --> 00:53:08,699
Okay, I have 'em
on the bench.

818
00:53:08,777 --> 00:53:10,745
Rachel,

819
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:14,578
I'm sorry, but there's nothing
I can do about that.

820
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,844
What makes you think
it's you?

821
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:22,116
It's not me?

822
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:25,449
I j... I just as-assumed
from...

823
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:30,191
- You're a moron, you know that?
- Yes. I know.

824
00:53:34,636 --> 00:53:37,002
Rachel, you're gonna have
to tell me about Brill.

825
00:53:39,775 --> 00:53:42,039
Let's get out of here.

826
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,704
All right.
They're on the move.

827
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:48,876
- Comin' to three. - Stay
with 'em. - I got 40, 20...

828
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:52,909
- [Garbled Audio]
- You're following through trees. Two, can you track them?

829
00:53:52,988 --> 00:53:55,718
I have lost line-of-sight.
Repeat, I have lost line-of-sight.

830
00:53:55,791 --> 00:53:58,316
- Three, you've got nothing.
- I've lost line-of-sight. I'm out.

831
00:53:58,393 --> 00:54:01,226
We've lost audio; it's gone. But we still
have his tracers. We can still follow 'em.

832
00:54:01,296 --> 00:54:03,764
When I need
to reach Brill,

833
00:54:03,832 --> 00:54:07,199
I chalk the mailbox
outside my house.

834
00:54:07,269 --> 00:54:10,397
When he crosses the mark,
I make the drop.

835
00:54:10,472 --> 00:54:14,568
The location's always the same...
same time, same place.

836
00:54:14,643 --> 00:54:17,134
3:00 p. m. Ferry
to Gibson Island.

837
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:20,943
- [Dean] You ever see him in person?
- He's the cautious type.

838
00:54:21,016 --> 00:54:23,177
He's not gonna like you
trackin' him down.

839
00:54:25,687 --> 00:54:28,247
The drop is
behind seat 32.

840
00:54:28,323 --> 00:54:31,759
I leave something;
he picks it up later.

841
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:08,252
[Horn Blaring]

842
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:28,014
I'm sorry it took so long. I had to
make sure you weren't being followed.

843
00:55:29,017 --> 00:55:32,282
- Brill.
- Brill's dead.

844
00:55:32,354 --> 00:55:35,619
Died of smallpox when he was two.
Buried in a field in Kansas.

845
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:38,750
- What is that? - It's a
bug-sweeper. - [Beeping]

846
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,556
- Take off your left shoe.
- What does it mean when...

847
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:47,432
Take off your shoe. I don't have time to
explain. Take off your shoe right now.

Who is "they"?

And why are they puttin' things
in my shoes?

No, get in the back,
like you're a customer.

Everything's gone... the wife,
job, bank accounts, everything.

You said Zavitz was behind
an extortion scheme?

856
00:56:35,217 --> 00:56:37,947
- No, they said it.
- You were the last one that talked to him?

857
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,454
- Yeah.
- What did he say?

858
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:43,389
- He said, "Help me, Bobby. "
- Help me with what?

859
00:56:43,459 --> 00:56:45,689
I don't know.
We never got around to that.

860

- What did he give you?
- Nothing. He didn't give me anything.

- A name? A phone number?

Nothing!
He didn't give me anything!

- Just somebody trying to get our attention.

Calm down. It's okay.

- I gotta go. Stop the ambulance.

Copy that.

1042

We got him. He's right
in front of us. Tunnel six.

1043
01:10:34,955 --> 01:10:38,618
He's heading south down tunnel six.
He's got nowhere to go.

1044
01:10:41,829 --> 01:10:45,094
He's crossed over.
He's on the wrong side.

Stop! Stop!

1046

We lost him. We lost him.
Son of a bitch! Pull over.

1047
01:11:00,014 --> 01:11:03,643
- He's currently entering vertical stairwell five.
- Where does that lead?

1048
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:06,743
Five leads to main access
to sub-ventilation tunnel.

- Closest vehicular access?
- Adjacent utility entrance, south side.

1050
01:11:11,826 --> 01:11:15,853
He's in the ventilation tunnel. Proceed to the
adjacent utility entrance on the south side.

1051
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:19,297
- There is no visual coverage.
- He's in a ventilation tunnel.

- Open the door. Open the door!

1180
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:07,198

to stay the fuck away from me.

Please, not now. Just drive.

1182
01:23:15,982 --> 01:23:20,146
- All right, what happened?
- Rachel's dead.

1183
01:23:24,524 --> 01:23:29,188
I told you not
to contact her. I told you.

- I think I found what they're looking for. My son had it.
- Get out of the fucking car.

Give me the toy.

You know
why they killed her?

1188
01:24:35,962 --> 01:24:38,226
Trying to make it
look like it was me.

1189
01:24:38,297 --> 01:24:40,492
They had my stuff planted
all over her house.

1190
01:24:40,566 --> 01:24:45,265
First, if you're a murder suspect,
you're gonna be easier to find,

1191
01:24:45,338 --> 01:24:49,001
and second, to discredit you,
in case you ever go public against them.

1192
01:24:49,075 --> 01:24:53,739
The N.S.A. Set you up.
It had nothing to do with Rachel.

1193
01:24:53,813 --> 01:24:56,646
Absolutely nothing.

- What have we got?
- We got nothing.

Van, give me the sat imagery
of the hotel roof.

1198
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:19,434
Okay, here. These are the parametrics for
the space vehicle during data acquisition.

1199
01:25:19,505 --> 01:25:22,167
Can we take a look at this guy
who's helping him?

1200
01:25:24,844 --> 01:25:26,869
Can you get
a feature extraction?

1201
01:25:26,946 --> 01:25:29,710
Mm-mmm.
He never looks up.

1202
01:25:29,782 --> 01:25:32,342
- He's smart.
- Why does he have to look up?

1203
01:25:32,418 --> 01:25:36,514
The satellite's about 155 miles above
the earth. It can only look straight down.

1204
01:25:36,589 --> 01:25:39,524
- That's kind of limited.
- Maybe you can design a new one.

1205
01:25:39,592 --> 01:25:41,150
Maybe I will, idiot.

1206

- Hello.
- Yeah, it's me.

1214

- Shut up and listen.

1215
01:26:12,725 --> 01:26:15,956
Go to the house. Go.
Do not call Carla.

1216
01:26:16,028 --> 01:26:18,997
Rachel Banks is dead. The papers
will make it sound like I killed her.

1217
01:26:19,065 --> 01:26:22,193
Tell her
that I didn't do it.

1218
01:26:22,268 --> 01:26:26,102
Make sure she goes. Get her
out of there. Tell 'em I love 'em.

1219
01:26:26,172 --> 01:26:31,906
The call is coming from 840 McClean,
Baltimore, between Hood and St. Anne's.

1220
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:33,605
Copy that. Yes!

1221
01:26:52,798 --> 01:26:54,732
What's up, man?

1222
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,600
We're gonna have to look at your
surveillance tapes for the last 20 minutes.

1223
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:03,404
- Hey, Larry!
- The surveillance footage is coming in now from Pratt.

1224
01:27:03,476 --> 01:27:05,876
Freeze it and process it
for face recognition.

1225
01:27:14,687 --> 01:27:18,054
Pratt, do we see
which way the car went?

1226
01:27:18,124 --> 01:27:21,719
No, sir. This kid here at the register
thinks that it might have went south.

1227
01:27:21,794 --> 01:27:23,955
Unfortunately,
the shot's too tight.

1228
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:27,227
I got make, model and color,
but the plates are phony.

1229

- Order satellite coverage on this sector.
- It's already done.

This is where I work.
This has been my office for 15 years.

1234
01:28:21,054 --> 01:28:26,549
It's completely secure. Copper wire
mesh keeps the radio signals out.

No phone or utility lines

Self-contained.
Unplugged from the world.

1246
01:29:05,998 --> 01:29:09,161
Nothing for a wire bug
to piggyback in on.

1247
01:29:09,235 --> 01:29:12,864
That leaves transmitters. It's easy
enough to signal-sweep for those.

1248
01:29:12,939 --> 01:29:16,773
Signal-sweeping for transmitters.
You're just a party animal.

The government's
been in bed...

with the entire telecommunications
industry since the '40s.

1251
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:25,250
They've infected everything.

1252
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:29,254
They can get into your bank statements,
your computer files, e-mail,

1253
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:31,256
listen
to your phone calls.

- My wife's been saying that for years.
- Every wire, every airwave.

The more technology you use, the easier
it is for them to keep tabs on you.

1256
01:29:40,967 --> 01:29:45,802
It's a brave new world out there.
At least it better be.

1257
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:06,891
There it goes.
It's some kind of simple encryption.

1258
01:30:06,959 --> 01:30:10,417
Oh, conspiracy theorists
of the world, unite.

1259
01:30:10,496 --> 01:30:13,522
It's more than a theory with me.
I'm a former conspirer.

1260
01:30:15,001 --> 01:30:18,994
I used to work for the N.S.A.
I was a communication analyst.

Listen to international calls,
calls from foreign nationalists.

1262
01:30:21,574 --> 01:30:24,634
That G.P.S. Tracking device we found
in your cellular telephone?

1263
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:28,009
I designed one of the first models
in that series.

1264
01:30:35,488 --> 01:30:40,858
Fort Meade has 18 acres
of mainframe computers underground.

1265
01:30:40,927 --> 01:30:45,330
You're talking on the phone and you use
the word, "bomb," "president," "Allah,"

1266
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:48,026
any of a hundred key words,
the computer recognizes it,

1267
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:52,002
automatically records it, red flags it
for analysis; that was 20 years ago.

1268
01:30:58,945 --> 01:31:01,607
You know the Hubble Telescope
that looks up to the stars?

1269
01:31:01,681 --> 01:31:05,845
They've got over a hundred spy satellites
looking down at us. That's classified.

1270
01:31:05,918 --> 01:31:09,854
In the old days, we actually had
to tap a wire into your phone line.

1271
01:31:09,922 --> 01:31:12,447
Now calls bouncin' around on satellite,
they snatch right out of the air.

1320
01:35:48,401 --> 01:35:50,494
We've got nothing.
It's over.

1321
01:36:02,815 --> 01:36:05,750
We have control.
Put down your weapons.

1322
01:36:13,025 --> 01:36:17,189
You think I wanted that idiot
to put that goddamn disk...

1323
01:36:17,263 --> 01:36:19,424
Who gives a fuck
what you wanted?

1324
01:36:19,498 --> 01:36:22,661
Since you've shown up, Rachel's dead
and the N.S.A.'s onto me.

1325
01:36:26,505 --> 01:36:29,838
Onto you? What do you mean
onto you? Onto you about what?

1326
01:36:29,909 --> 01:36:32,343
You're not the target.
I am.

1327
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:47,057
We got him.
He's right in front of us.

1328
01:36:49,128 --> 01:36:51,062
Come on, come on.

1329
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:56,898
We got him.
He's got nowhere to go.

1330
01:37:07,379 --> 01:37:10,007
Air One to ground, they're
somewhere between the trains.

1331
01:37:11,217 --> 01:37:13,742
Get the fuck
away from me.

1332
01:37:15,254 --> 01:37:16,881
Damn it!

1333
01:37:16,956 --> 01:37:19,015
We're coming back around.

1334
01:37:19,091 --> 01:37:23,118
- You're blowing my whole life.
- What life? You live in a fucking jar...

1335
01:37:23,195 --> 01:37:25,129
so the world
can't touch you.

1336
01:37:25,197 --> 01:37:27,165
And you didn't give
a shit about Rachel!

1337
01:37:27,233 --> 01:37:29,827
Just some package
under seat number 32.

1338
01:37:32,571 --> 01:37:36,473
- Come on! - Do you have
a problem? - Go on! Do it!

1339
01:37:37,676 --> 01:37:41,043
I'm all you've got!
And you're all I've got.

1340
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:51,013
Heading west
towards the freeway.

1341
01:37:57,796 --> 01:38:00,959
[Horn Honks]

1342
01:38:02,301 --> 01:38:04,895
- Get out of the fucking car!
- All right.

1343
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:06,870
- Come on. Get out.
- All right.

1344
01:38:06,939 --> 01:38:09,407
- Don't do this to me.
- Tell your story walking.

1345
01:38:09,475 --> 01:38:12,410
Hey, wait a minute.
Don't... Oh, for God sakes.

1346
01:38:12,478 --> 01:38:15,379
- Thanks for your help back at the train.
- Wait a minute.

1347
01:38:17,383 --> 01:38:19,374
Oh, for Jesus...

1348
01:38:19,451 --> 01:38:24,218
Air One to ground, I think we lost them.
They're somewhere beneath the overpass.

1349
01:38:25,658 --> 01:38:27,091
[Purrs]

1350
01:38:32,798 --> 01:38:36,495
Well, you certainly carjacked
a really nice car.

1351
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:40,528
This is a piece of shit.
What are you talking about?

1352
01:38:40,606 --> 01:38:44,872
[Sighs] I need sugar, you know.
I'm getting cranky.

1353
01:38:44,944 --> 01:38:46,878
Getting?

1354
01:38:46,946 --> 01:38:51,042
I'm hypoglycemic. My body
can't metabolize the sugar, so...

1355
01:38:51,116 --> 01:38:54,108
So you're a pain in the ass
when you don't eat.

1356
01:38:54,186 --> 01:38:56,120
Basically.

1357
01:38:56,188 --> 01:38:58,656
Yeah. Right.

1358
01:38:58,724 --> 01:39:01,784
- We should eat then.
- Let's do that.

1359
01:39:01,927 --> 01:39:04,327
[Hicks]
His real name is Edward Lyle.

1360
01:39:04,396 --> 01:39:08,355
Graduated from Drexel University.
Enlisted in the army, 1953.

1361
01:39:08,434 --> 01:39:11,562
Rapid promotion, excelled
at intelligence and communications.

1362
01:39:11,637 --> 01:39:15,505
- Join N.S.A. In '65.
- Of course.

1363
01:39:15,574 --> 01:39:19,066
He was in the agency till 1980 when
he vanished and went underground.

1364
01:39:19,144 --> 01:39:22,477
- Hasn't been seen since.
- That's a long time.

1365
01:39:22,548 --> 01:39:25,108
Lots of black bags,
lots of deleteds.

1366
01:39:25,184 --> 01:39:28,017
He's familiar
with explosives, obviously.

1367
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:32,251
His last assignment, he went into Iran,
late '78, after the Shah.

1368
01:39:32,324 --> 01:39:35,259
- This is our problem.
- This man.

1369
01:39:38,030 --> 01:39:43,662
So, we were helping
the secret police supply weapons...

1370
01:39:43,736 --> 01:39:46,330
to the Afghani rebels
fighting the Soviets.

1371
01:39:46,405 --> 01:39:49,704
My partner and I were on the eastern border
monitoring Soviet military transmissions.

1372
01:39:49,775 --> 01:39:52,471
It was kind of fun actually.
I liked the Iranians.

1373
01:39:52,544 --> 01:39:56,480
Back in Tehran, the hard-liners
seized the embassy,

1374
01:39:56,548 --> 01:39:59,244
and overnight,
the whole country changed.

1375
01:39:59,318 --> 01:40:02,810
People we'd been working with,
they turned on us. I got out.

1376
01:40:02,888 --> 01:40:04,822
My partner didn't.

1377
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:06,824
By the time I got home,

1378
01:40:06,892 --> 01:40:09,383
the whole mission had become
a press disaster waiting to happen.

1379
01:40:09,461 --> 01:40:11,827
Aiding and abetting
the new enemy.

1380
01:40:11,897 --> 01:40:15,162
The agency conveniently
forgot I existed.

1381
01:40:16,468 --> 01:40:21,098
I don't blame them.
It's what they had to do.

1382
01:40:21,173 --> 01:40:23,869
I loved the agency.

1383
01:40:23,942 --> 01:40:27,309
I loved the work.
I loved the people.

1384
01:40:27,379 --> 01:40:29,404
It was my whole life.

1385
01:40:30,983 --> 01:40:33,474
Your partner
was Rachel's father.

1386
01:40:33,552 --> 01:40:36,953
Yeah. The idea was...

1387
01:40:37,022 --> 01:40:41,857
The idea always was that if one of us got
out, he'd take care of the other's family.

1388
01:40:41,927 --> 01:40:44,418
Rachel was all he had.

1389
01:40:44,496 --> 01:40:46,987
So she became
my promise to him.

1390
01:40:47,066 --> 01:40:49,899
- [Woman] Here you go, hon.
- Thank you.

1391
01:40:53,939 --> 01:40:56,737
Maybe we can still keep
that promise in a way.

1392
01:40:56,809 --> 01:40:59,403
You're a threat now,
just like I was.

1393
01:40:59,478 --> 01:41:01,742
Threat to whom? To them?

1394
01:41:01,814 --> 01:41:05,511
To your family, friends,
everyone you know, everyone you meet.

1395
01:41:05,584 --> 01:41:10,180
That's why I went away and didn't
come back. You gotta go away, Robert.

1396
01:41:10,255 --> 01:41:13,019
No, I don't think so.
This is my life.

1397
01:41:13,092 --> 01:41:15,526
I worked hard for it,
and I want it back.

1398
01:41:15,594 --> 01:41:18,392
I grew up without a father.
I know what that is.

1399
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:21,126
And I will not allow
my family to go through that.

1400
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:23,259
[Kid]
Mommy,

1401
01:41:23,335 --> 01:41:25,462
I don't wanna go home.

1402
01:41:31,009 --> 01:41:33,603
Wanna take
a poke at me?

1403
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:37,613
- Come on.
- I don't hit senior citizens.

1404
01:41:40,285 --> 01:41:42,879
- Oh, come here, Babe.
- [Purrs]

1405
01:41:42,955 --> 01:41:43,979
Come up here. Come on.

1406
01:41:45,157 --> 01:41:48,718
In guerilla warfare, you try
to use your weaknesses as strengths.

1407
01:41:48,794 --> 01:41:51,786
- Such as?
- Well,

1408
01:41:51,864 --> 01:41:57,359
if they're big and you're small,
then you're mobile and they're slow.

1409
01:41:57,436 --> 01:42:00,295
You're hidden
and they're exposed.

1410
01:42:00,372 --> 01:42:03,881
Only fight battles you know you can win.
That's the way the Vietcong did it.

1411
01:42:03,958 --> 01:42:08,342
You capture their weapons and you
use them against them the next time.

1412
01:42:08,411 --> 01:42:12,177
That way they're supplying you.
You grow stronger as they grow weaker.

1413
01:42:13,683 --> 01:42:16,481
- Hey, try these.
- Can I have something else, please?

1414
01:42:16,553 --> 01:42:18,919
- Yeah. Here.
- Never mind.

1415
01:42:20,490 --> 01:42:24,950
- That's my best aloha shirt.
- Well, say "aloha" to it.

1416
01:42:33,870 --> 01:42:37,704
- Steve, how you doing? Need some gear.
- Howdy. Help yourself.

1417
01:42:37,774 --> 01:42:40,937
- Hi, Bill. - Say hi to
Bill. - How you doing, Bill?

1418
01:42:41,011 --> 01:42:44,845
Steve, where's the two gigahertz
video transmitters?

1419
01:42:44,914 --> 01:42:47,405
Right behind you,
second shelf.

1420
01:42:47,484 --> 01:42:50,009
Steve? I thought you said
his name was Bill.

1421
01:42:50,086 --> 01:42:52,020
No. You're Bill.

1422
01:42:52,088 --> 01:42:56,184
- If I'm Bill, let me know I'm Bill.
- I just did.

1423
01:42:56,259 --> 01:42:59,228
The president has not
committed himself,

1424
01:42:59,295 --> 01:43:03,698
but he does recognize that we
do need something in this area.

1425
01:43:03,767 --> 01:43:06,565
And I think he will come to see
that this bill will, in the end,

1426
01:43:06,636 --> 01:43:10,163
provide the kind
of security that this...

1427
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:13,539
- What security?
- The kind of security he's gonna need.

1428
01:43:17,047 --> 01:43:19,208
[Brill]
Ah, here we go.

1429
01:43:19,282 --> 01:43:22,979
Modified cell phone
interfaced with laptop computer.

1430
01:43:23,053 --> 01:43:26,181
- Creates an enormously powerful tool.
- What is that?

1431
01:43:26,256 --> 01:43:31,159
This is Congressman Albert's
home address and his cellular E.S.N.

1432
01:43:31,227 --> 01:43:33,991
Now, we reprogram
our phone...

1433
01:43:34,064 --> 01:43:38,694
with Congressman Albert's E.S.N.,
and you know what we got?

1434
01:43:38,768 --> 01:43:41,703
[Albert] Hi, sweetie.
We just landed. So, how are the kids?

1435
01:43:41,771 --> 01:43:44,205
- [Woman] Melissa has a fever.
- She okay?

1436
01:43:44,274 --> 01:43:46,606
She's fine. When will you have
some time to talk?

1437
01:43:46,676 --> 01:43:49,907
About 30, 40 minutes.
I'll be in suite 59, Lincoln Hotel.

1438
01:43:49,979 --> 01:43:52,466
You're a dangerous man.
[Chuckling]

1439
01:43:52,599 --> 01:43:54,032
Oh, shit.

1440
01:43:58,087 --> 01:44:00,055
Aw, shit.

1441
01:44:00,122 --> 01:44:02,852
[Click, Beep]

1442
01:44:14,536 --> 01:44:16,766
- Say something.
- Excuse me?

1443
01:44:16,839 --> 01:44:19,137
- Louder.
- What are you talking about?

1444
01:44:19,208 --> 01:44:21,199
That's good.

1445
01:44:22,478 --> 01:44:25,311
- Won't they look in there?
- That's the idea.

1446
01:44:25,381 --> 01:44:27,576
Great plan.

1447
01:44:29,151 --> 01:44:31,585
I've been a law-abiding
citizen my whole life.

1448
01:44:31,654 --> 01:44:37,058
One day with you, I'm shooting and...
breaking... I have to go to the bathroom.

1449
01:44:37,126 --> 01:44:41,222
- [Man] Rest well.
- [Albert] Thanks. Bye.

1450
01:44:42,631 --> 01:44:44,565
Good work, guys.

1451
01:44:47,503 --> 01:44:50,404
[Knocking]

1452
01:44:51,974 --> 01:44:54,568
Hmm.

1453
01:45:02,651 --> 01:45:05,779
- We got him.
- [Woman Sighs]

1454
01:45:05,854 --> 01:45:07,788
Yeah, go for it,
Mr. Congressman.

1455
01:45:14,029 --> 01:45:17,590
- You're too young to watch this part here.
- Yeah, so is she.

1456
01:45:21,103 --> 01:45:23,333
[Sighs]

1457
01:45:23,405 --> 01:45:25,635
[TV On]

1458
01:45:31,146 --> 01:45:33,876
Yeah, could you send somebody
up to my room, please?

1459
01:45:33,949 --> 01:45:36,941
Yes, this is Christa,
the congressman's aide.

1460
01:45:37,019 --> 01:45:40,614
- [Men Chattering]
- How the hell am I supposed to know what it is?

1461
01:45:40,689 --> 01:45:43,283
I'm just a congressman,
for Christ's sake.

1462
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:45,293
Security expert tells me...

1463
01:45:45,361 --> 01:45:49,457
it's like a PX-73 burst transmitter,
whatever the hell that is.

1464
01:45:49,531 --> 01:45:51,897
Except it's
much more sophisticated.

1465
01:45:51,967 --> 01:45:55,788
Of course I'm going to send it down.
That's not the...

1466

01:56:23,494 --> 01:56:28,955
- Oh, you don't think so?
- If I go in there and I bring that tape out, I'm a dead man.

1612
01:56:29,033 --> 01:56:31,558
We go together,
you and me.

1613

You view the tape,
you sign off on it.

home, everyone has a Merry Christmas.

that you haven't copied that tape?

I want copies?

That tape has been
the bane of my existence.

was at the bottom of the Chesapeake.

If I need you, Hicks will call it.

or something in here?

- Yeah. - It's good food.

Hey, how you doing?

1639
01:58:52,343 --> 01:58:54,402
What's this, the F.B.I.?

1640
01:58:55,980 --> 01:58:59,040
No, sir, Mr. Pintero. This is
the gentleman you wanted to meet.

1641
01:58:59,117 --> 01:59:01,915
- Oh, that's him?
- Yep, that's him.

01:59:01,986 --> 01:59:05,353
- So you made the tape?
- What?

1643
01:59:05,423 --> 01:59:08,859
Did you make the videotape?

1644
01:59:08,926 --> 01:59:11,759
Look, he wants it back.

1645

Really? I don't give
a shit what he wants.

some privacy, please?

Yeah, maybe we should.

- Come on, boys.

Oh, yeah. Okay.

- Hey, look.

Number one:
He's not my friend.

1663

- And number two: It's not his tape.
- Whose is it?

1664
02:00:27,271 --> 02:00:30,707
It's mine, okay?
It's mine. I bought it.

you trying to do to me?

1668
02:00:45,289 --> 02:00:48,281
- Oh, this looks bad.
- I'm with the federal government.

1669
02:00:48,359 --> 02:00:50,293
The federal government
made a videotape?

- You guys oughta get in there.
- Wait a minute. Listen.

with the F.B.I., take anything we want,

02:00:57,135 --> 02:01:00,366
arrest anybody that we want...
just give the man the videotape.

get arrested here is you...

we were there for technical support.

- Do they know that Reynolds is dead?

all that? - Right.
