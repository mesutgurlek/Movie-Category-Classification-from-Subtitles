926

...because her real father
is this large-type asshole.

927

on the down slope of a marriage...

928
01:30:23,876 --> 01:30:25,752
...my third...

929
01:30:27,171 --> 01:30:30,841
...because I spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

930

That's my life.

931

A guy told me one time:

932
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,646
"Don't let yourself get attached
to anything...

933
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:47,524
...you are not willing to walk out on
in 30 seconds flat...

...if you feel the heat around the corner."

and you gotta move when I move...

...how do you expect to keep a...
A marriage?

939

953
01:32:02,975 --> 01:32:05,644
I'm sitting at this big banquet table...

954
01:32:05,811 --> 01:32:09,689
...and all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are sitting at this table...

955
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:14,110
...and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

956
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:19,282
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

957
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:23,119
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

958
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:26,373
...because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

959
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:30,043
The neighbors reported the smell...

960
01:32:30,586 --> 01:32:34,589
...and there they are,
all of them just sitting there.

What do they say?

962
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:40,804
Nothing.

01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:42,639

- None.

you victimize Dominick.

...because you got no living parents
