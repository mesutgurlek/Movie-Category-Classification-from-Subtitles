1
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,080
What the hell...?
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...

2
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,600
What the hell...?

3
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,900
Hey, my turn.

4
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,870
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

5
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,880
Nice night for a walk?

6
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,020
Nice night for a walk.

7
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,150
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

8
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,110
Nothing clean. Right.

9
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,320
I think this guy's a couple of cans short of a six-pack.

10
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,650
Your clothes, give them to me.

11
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,000
- Now.
- Fuck you, asshole.

12
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,510
Hey, buddy, did you just see a real bright light?

13
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,850
- See that guy?
- Hold it right there.

14
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,480
- He's rabbiting. Go.
- Hey! I said hold it!

15
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,650
That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.

16
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,777
- What day is it? The date.
- 12th May.

17
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,740
- Thursday.
- What year?

18
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,970
He's got my gun. Let's go.

19
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,560
Guard it for me, Big Buns.

20
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,190
Hi. I'm late.

21
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,280
So am I.

22
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,160
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

23
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,670
- Honey, can I have that coffee now, please?
- Yes, sir.

24
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,540
- OK. Who gets the burly-beef?
- I ordered barbecued.

25
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,750
- That's mine, but I didn't order fries.
- He gets the burly-beef.

26
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,220
- Mine's the chilli beef deluxe.
- Ok, Who gets the burly-beef?

27
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,220
- We're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

28
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,760
I'm so sorry.

29
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,890
This isn't real leather, is it?

30
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,280
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.

31
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,160
Look at it this way.
In 100 years, who's gonna care?

32
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,960
The 12-gauge auto-loader.

33
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,010
That's Italian.
You can go pump or auto.

34
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,590
The 45 long slide with laser sighting.

35
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,180
These are brand new. We just got them in.
That's a good gun.

36
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,560
Just touch the trigger, the beam comes on...

37
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:05,561
...and you put the red dot where you want the bullet to go.

38
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,730
You can't miss.

39
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,280
- Anything else?
- A phased plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.

40
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,110
Hey, just what you see, pal.

41
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,820
The Uzi nine millimetre.

42
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,410
You know your weapons, buddy.

43
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,830
Any one of these is ideal for home defence.

44
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,870
So which will it be?

45
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,590
- All.
- I may close early today.

46
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:36,010
It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take right now.

47
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,180
- You can't do that.
- Wrong.

48
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,870
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

49
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,210
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.

50
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,630
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...?

51
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,590
Hey, man, you got a serious attitude problem.

52
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,020
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

53
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,250
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

54
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,090
Sarah, come here. It's about you.
I mean, sort of.

55
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,760
It's so incredible. You're not gonna believe this.
Sit down. You're going to love this.

56
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,760
- What?
- ...has been compiled from several witnesses.

57
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,180
Once again, Sarah Connor, 35, mother of two,...

58
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,730
...brutally shot to death in her home this afternoon.

59
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,100
You're dead, honey.

60
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,090
..if you're into sound,...

61
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:14,550
...for the greatest sound around,
come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.

62
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,810
We've got woofers, tweeters, the
newest in audio and compact laser discs.

63
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,310
We've got graphic equalisers and sound balancers that...

64
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,460
Sorry.

65
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,100
Hello?

66
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,440
First I'm gonna rip the buttons off your blouse one by one,...

67
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,900
...and then run my tongue down your neck to your bare,
gleaming breasts.

68
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:15,410
And then slowly...
slowly pull your jeans off inch by inch.

69
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,740
Ginger, it's Matt.

70
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:23,000
And lick your belly in circles further and further down,...

71
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,380
...and then pull your panties off with my teeth.

72
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,000
Who is this?

73
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,300
God. Sarah?

74
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,430
Jesus. I'm sorry.

75
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,380
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger please?

76
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,660
Sure, Bunky.

77
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,340
It's the creep.

78
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:46,970
Hello?

79
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,600
First I'll rip the buttons off your blouse one by one...

80
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,520
You fucking pigs.
Wait till I get my hands on you. Get off me.

81
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,490
Ed.

82
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,950
- What have you got?
- Dead girl.

83
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,800
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.

84
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,540
Shot six times at less than 10 feet.
Large calibre weapon.

85
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,710
You know, these work.

86
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,670
- What's this?
- Dead girl two.

87
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,090
Sent over from the Valley division this afternoon.

88
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,050
Are you sure there's a point to all of this?

89
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,550
Look at the name, Ed.

90
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,390
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

91
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,390
You're kidding me.

92
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,150
The press is going to be short-stroking it all over.

93
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,650
- A one-day pattern killer.
- I hate the weird ones.

94
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,070
So...

95
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,950
Better than mortal man deserves.

96
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:04,420
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- No, not lately. Did you check messages?

97
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,930
I thought you did.

98
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,180
- Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
- There you are, young man.

99
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,560
You mind your mother.

100
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,920
Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.
Something's come up.

101
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,700
Looks like I won't be able to make it tonight.
Just can't get out of it.

102
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,540
Look I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you.
Call you in a day or so, Ok? Sorry. Bye.

103
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,470
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

104
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,170
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.

105
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,340
I'll live.

106
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,720
I'll break his kneecaps.

107
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,220
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?

108
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,890
God. It's disgusting.

109
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,910
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Ok. You and Matt have a good time

110
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:03,820
- We will. You, too.
- OK.

111
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,160
Damn it, Matt.

112
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,840
Oh, shit.

113
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,090
Lieutenant, are you aware that these two killings...

114
00:25:11,091 --> 00:25:13,291
...occurred in the same order as their listings in the phone book?

115
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,860
- Now, what can I tell you guys? No comment.
- But Lieutenant, we've got two murders in a...

116
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,290
That coffee's two hours cold.

117
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,800
I put a cigarette out in it.

118
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,430
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I keep getting an answering machine..

119
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,100
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit. There's no answer at the door,...

120
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,560
- ...and the apartment manager's not in.
- Call her.

121
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,560
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

122
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,730
Give me a cigarette.

123
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:03,660
Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

124
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:08,870
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too, so talk to it and this is...

125
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,710
Same shit.

126
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,470
I can hear it now.
He's gonna be called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

127
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,810
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.

128
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,020
- Where are you going?
- To make a statement.

129
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,150
Maybe make these jackals work for us for a change.

130
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:37,070
If I can get on the tube by eleven o'clock,
maybe she'll call us.

131
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,820
Well, how do I look?

132
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,280
- Like shit, boss.
- Your mama.

133
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,580
This just in.
Police have announced the name of the victim...

134
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,210
...in the second of two execution-style murders which took place today.

135
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,750
Incredibly, the names of the two victims are virtually identical.

136
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,550
Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann Connor
was pronounced dead at the scene in her...

137
00:27:00,551 --> 00:27:03,430
- Santa Monica apartment...
- Can we change this? - Sarah Louise Connor

138
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,060
- ...was slain by alone gun man earlier today in her home.
- Don't touch it.

139
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,250
Now, police are refusing to speculate on the...

140
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:11,651
...apparent similarity between these shooting deaths...

141
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,070
...and no other connection between the
two victims has been established as of yet.

142
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,990
Ofcourse we'll have more on this late-breaking story as it comes in.

143
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,950
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back.

144
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,540
Hey. Four-fifty.

145
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,000
You have reached the Los Angeles Police Department emergency number.

146
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:42,880
All our lines are busy. If you need a police
car sent out to you, please stay on the line.

147
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:48,481
Pugsley, shoo!

148
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,240
Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.

149
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,170
Don't make me bust you up, man.

150
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,240
Hi, there. Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

151
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,320
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too.

152
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,540
So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you.

153
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,210
Wait for the beep.

154
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,670
Ginger, this is Sarah!
Pick up if you're there!

155
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:30,590
I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard called Tech Noir.
I'm really scared. I...

156
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:35,760
...think that there's somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.

157
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,470
I need you and Matt to come and pick me up as soon as possible.

158
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,980
The police keep transferring me around.
I'm gonna give 'em another try.

159
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:49,400
The number here is 555 9175.
Call me, kiddo. I need your help.

160
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,710
It's her.

161
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,340
Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.

162
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,910
Don't put me on hold.
Don't transfer me to another department.

163
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,280
Don't worry I won't. And just relax.
Can you tell me where you are?

164
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:21,260
- I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.
- Yeah I know it. It's on Pico.

165
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:24,100
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.

166
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,310
- I think there's a guy following me.
- All right, now listen, Miss Connor. Now, listen carefully.

167
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,940
You're in a public place so you'll be safe till we get there.
But stay visible.

168
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:33,741
Don't go outside or even to the rest room.

169
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,450
- I'll have a car there in a hot minute.
- OK.

170
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,430
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

171
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,550
Come with me if you wanna live.

172
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,690
Come on!

173
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,900
This is one-L-19. I got a hit-and-run felony.

174
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,360
Suspect vehicle - late model grey Ford headed westbound on Seven.

175
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,650
He's really moving - punching lights all the way.

176
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:21,530
I'm gonna need an ambulance at Seventh and Broadway right now.

177
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,910
Hold it.

178
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,510
Hold on.

179
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:57,230
Are you injured? Are you shot?

180
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,870
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

181
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,500
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.

182
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,920
Do you understand?

183
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,590
- Do you understand?
- Yes. Please don't hurt me.

184
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,610
I'm here to help you.

185
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:40,400
I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com, DN38416.
Assigned to protect you.

186
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,860
You've been targeted for termination.

187
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:57,250
This is one-L-19.
Westbound on Olympic. Approaching Overland.

188
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,840
This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.

189
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:08,680
No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.

190
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:12,410
This isn't true.
How could that man just get up after you...

191
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,350
It's not a man. A machine.

192
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,980
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101 .

193
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,160
A machine? Like a robot?

194
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,830
Not a robot.
A cyborg - cybernetic organism.

195
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,790
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

196
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,630
Get your head down.

197
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,140
All right, listen. The Terminator's an infiltration unit.
Part man, part machine.

198
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:38,190
Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat chassis.
Microprocessor controlled.

199
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:42,780
Fully armoured, very tough.
But outside it's living human tissue.

200
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:47,240
Flesh, skin, hair, blood - grown for the cyborgs.

201
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,200
- Look, Reese, I don't know what you want...
- Pay attention.

202
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,790
I gotta ditch this car.

203
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,080
The 600-Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.

204
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:03,710
But these are new. They look human.

205
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,670
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

206
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,390
I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him.

207
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:17,180
Look, I am not stupid you know.
They cannot make things like that yet.

208
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:21,230
Not yet. Not for about forty years.

209
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,900
Are you saying it's from the future?

210
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:30,040
One possible future.
From your point of view.

211
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,990
I don't know tech stuff.

212
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,870
Then you're from the future, too.
Is that right?

213
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,040
- Right.
- Right.

214
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:51,590
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do. Don't do that again.

215
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,720
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand.

216
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,310
That Terminator is out there.

217
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,360
It can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with.

218
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,190
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear...

219
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:14,280
...and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.

220
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,250
Can you stop it?

221
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,550
I don't know.

222
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,010
With these weapons, I don't know.

223
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:57,951
All units, all units. Gray Ford suspect vehicle
has been found in a parking structure at Fourth and Beaudry.

224
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,920
Reese, why me?

225
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,710
Why does it want me?

226
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,680
There was a nuclear war.

227
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,520
A few years from now,...

228
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:09,270
...all this, this whole place, everything,...

229
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,990
...it's gone, just gone.

230
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,820
There were survivors.

231
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,290
Here, there.

232
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,750
Nobody even knew who started it.

233
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,710
- It was the machines, Sarah.
- I don't understand.

234
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,380
Defence network computers.

235
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:38,220
New, powerful,...

236
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:44,140
...hooked into everything, trusted to run it all.

237
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:48,810
They say it got smart - a new order of intelligence.

238
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,650
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.

239
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,660
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

240
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,200
Extermination.

241
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,630
Did you see this war?

242
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:35,190
No. I grew up after. In the ruins.

243
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,400
Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.

244
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:41,410
- H-Ks?
- Hunter-killers.

245
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:45,450
Patrol machines built in automated factories.

246
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:50,210
Most of us were rounded up.
Put in camps for orderly disposal.

247
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,210
This was burned in by laser scanner.

248
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:02,220
Some of us were kept alive. To work.

249
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:05,970
Loading bodies.

250
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,810
The disposal units ran night and day.

251
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,980
We were that close to going out forever.

252
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:18,740
But there was one man who taught us to fight.

253
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,900
To storm the wire of the camps.

254
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,620
To smash those metal motherfuckers into junk.

255
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,870
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.

256
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,330
His name was Connor. John Connor.

257
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,090
Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.

258
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:29,620
Drive.

259
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:38,630
Reese!

260
00:49:56,810 --> 00:50:00,370
No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.

261
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,190
You in the Cadillac, let me see your hands now.

262
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:09,110
Get out of the car.

263
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,620
Drop to your knees.

264
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:17,040
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

265
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,740
Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.

266
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:54,540
Listen, are you sure it's them?

267
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,660
I mean, maybe I should look at the bodies.

268
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:02,000
No. They've been identified and there's no doubt.

269
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:09,170
Ginger. Kiddo.

270
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:14,930
- Sarah, Sarah, this is Dr Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

271
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:19,100
I want you to tell him everything that Reese told you, Sarah.
Do you feel up to that?

272
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,270
Yeah, I guess so.

273
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:27,070
- You're a doctor?
- Criminal psychologist.

274
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:31,990
- Is Reese crazy?
- Well, that's what we're gonna find out.

275
00:52:56,490 --> 00:53:00,200
So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?

276
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:06,920
With the 132nd under Perry.
From '21 to '27.

277
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,840
That's the year 2027?

278
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,010
That's right. Then I was assigned...

279
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,930
- This is fucking great.
- ...the last two years under John Connor.

280
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:19,540
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defence system built for...

281
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,560
Goddamn! Sorry.

282
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,190
..built for SAC-NORAD by Cyberdyne Systems.

283
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,350
I see.

284
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:33,280
And this computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy.

285
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,700
Killing him, in effect, before he's even conceived.

286
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,070
A sort of retroactive abortion?

287
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:44,280
That guy Silberman cracks me up.
Last week he had this guy in here who burned his Afgan.

288
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,290
- He screwed it first then he set it on fire.
- Ed, shut up.

289
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,130
Why didn't the computer just kill Connor then?

290
00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:51,750
Why this elaborate scheme with the Terminator?

291
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,340
It had no choice.
Their defence grid was smashed.

292
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:00,850
We'd won.
Taking out Connor then would make no difference.

293
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:03,890
Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence.

294
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:08,810
Is that when you captured the lab complex and
found the, uh, What is it called?

295
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,400
The time displacement equipment?

296
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,360
That's right.
The Terminator had already gone through.

297
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:18,530
Connor sent me to intercept and they blew the whole place.

298
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:21,370
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

299
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,490
I can't.

300
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:29,750
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.

301
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,420
It's just him and me.

302
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:22,360
It's just him and me.

303
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:29,540
Why didn't you bring any weapons?
Something more advanced.

304
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,540
Don't you have ray guns?

305
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:36,210
- Ray guns.
- Show me a piece of future technology.

306
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:41,210
You go naked.
Something about the field generated by a living organism.

307
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:45,160
Nothing dead will go.
I didn't build the fucking thing.

308
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:49,670
OK, OK. But this cyborg, if it's metal... ?

309
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:53,222
- Surrounded by living tissue.
- Oh, right.

310
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:56,160
This is great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.

311
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:59,250
You see how clever this part is?
How it doesn't require a shred of proof?

312
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:04,000
Most paranoid delusions are intricate, but this is brilliant.

313
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:08,840
- Why were the other two women killed?
- Most of the records were lost in the war.

314
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:11,650
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.

315
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:15,470
Her full name, where she lived.
They just knew the city.

316
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,480
The Terminator was just being systematic.

317
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,400
- Well, let's go back...
- Look, you have heard enough.

318
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:24,860
I have answered your questions.
Now I have to see Sarah Connor.

319
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,820
- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?

320
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,990
- Because I can help you.
- Who is in authority here? - Please...

321
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:33,060
Shut up!

322
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,890
You still don't get it, do you?

323
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:42,656
He'll find her. That's what he does.
That's all he does. You can't stop him.

324
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:47,050
He'll wade through you,
reach down her throat and pull her fucking heart out!

325
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,860
- Doc.
- Let go of me!

326
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,910
Sorry.

327
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,340
So, Reese is crazy?

328
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,880
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

329
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:11,070
Sarah, this is what they call body armour.
Our TAC guys wear these.

330
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,350
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.

331
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:17,830
This other individual must been wearing one under his coat.
Feel that. Go ahead.

332
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:23,630
- What about when he punched through the windshield?
- He was probably on PCP.

333
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:26,460
Broke every bone in his hand and wouldn't feel it for hours.

334
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:29,050
There was this guy once...
You see this scar?

335
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,120
- Here.
- Thank you.

336
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,930
There's a couch in this other room.
Why don't you stretch out and try to get some sleep?

337
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,600
It'll be an hour before your mother gets here from Big Bear.

338
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:40,790
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

339
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,150
Well it may not look it, but that couch is very comfortable.

340
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:50,610
You'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.

341
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,640
Thank you.

342
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,480
- Good night.
- Good night.

343
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:20,040
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told that she's here. Could I see her, please?

344
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:22,390
No. Can't see her.
She's making a statement.

345
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,040
Where is she?

346
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:29,020
Look it make take a while.
If you wanna wait, there's a bench over there.

347
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,480
I'll be back.

348
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,120
Stay here.

349
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:19,450
Watch him.

350
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:28,520
Ed...

351
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,510
Sarah!

352
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:01,640
Reese.

353
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:06,180
This way.

354
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:49,390
KFLB news time. 4.36.

355
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:53,710
In the top story of the hour the largest
single law enforcement mobilization...

356
01:03:53,712 --> 01:03:56,120
...in California history is currently underway.

357
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:00,330
Police in five southern counties are
engaged in a massive manhunt for an unident

358
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:05,530
Take this.

359
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:10,660
All right. Let's get this off the road.

360
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:44,820
- You cold?
- Freezing.

361
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:00,670
Reese?

362
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:04,150
- You got a first name?
- Kyle.

363
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:09,870
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?

364
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,600
White light.

365
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:18,860
Pain.

366
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:25,660
- It's like being born maybe.
- My God.

367
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,580
I caught one back there.

368
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:32,830
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

369
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:37,480
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
- It's OK. Forget it.

370
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:42,520
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy? Take this off.

371
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:56,230
Jesus.

372
01:05:56,350 --> 01:05:58,940
See? It passed right through the meat.

373
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,480
This is gonna make me puke.

374
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:04,880
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?

375
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:09,550
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

376
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,330
He's about my height.

377
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,790
He has your eyes.

378
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,920
What's he like?

379
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:26,760
You trust him. He's got a strength.

380
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:30,550
I'd die for John Connor.

381
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:37,040
Well, at least now I know what to name him.

382
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:42,960
I don't suppose you know who the father is
so I won't tell him to get lost when I meet him.

383
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,860
John never said much about him.

384
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:49,170
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait.

385
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:53,240
I don't wanna know.

386
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:56,750
So was it John that sent you here?

387
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:59,580
I volunteered.

388
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:04,610
- Why?
- It was a chance to meet the legend.

389
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:11,570
Sarah Connor, who taught her son to fight, organise,...

390
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,760
...prepare from when he was a kid.

391
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:17,600
When you were in hiding before the war.

392
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:23,580
You're talking about things
I haven't done yet in the past tense.

393
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:26,150
It's driving me crazy.

394
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:31,910
Are you sure you have the right person?

395
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:34,200
I'm sure.

396
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:38,350
Come on! Do I look like the mother of the future?

397
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:45,100
I mean, am I tough? Organised?
I can't even balance my chequebook.

398
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:52,150
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honour and I don't want it.

399
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:54,510
Any of it.

400
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:01,910
Your son gave me a message to give to you.
Made me memorise it.

401
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:05,120
Thank you, Sarah, for your courage through the dark years.

402
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:09,920
I can't help you with what you must soon face
except to say that the future is not set.

403
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:12,590
You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.

404
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:15,950
You must survive or I will never exist.

405
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,120
That's all.

406
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:23,750
It's a good field dressing.

407
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,920
You like it?

408
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,300
It's my first.

409
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,550
Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.

410
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,560
OK.

411
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,650
Talk to me some more.

412
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:58,080
About what?

413
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,910
Tell me about where you're from.

414
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:04,920
All right.

415
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:10,940
You stay down by day, but at night you can move around.

416
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,240
You still have to be careful because the H-Ks use infrared.

417
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:22,530
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.

418
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:26,090
That's when the infiltrators started to appear.

419
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,920
The Terminators were the newest.
The worst.

420
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:44,890
Traversing your sector in search mode.
750 metres north of your position.

421
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,380
Let's go.

422
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,450
- Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

423
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:13,980
Terminator!

424
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:33,640
I was dreaming about dogs.

425
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:36,860
We use 'em to spot Terminators.

426
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:40,860
Your world is pretty terrifying.

427
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:22,790
Hey, buddy, you got a dead cat in there or what?

428
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,120
Fuck you, asshole.

429
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,930
God damn.

430
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:55,430
Thank you.

431
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:02,900
Is this enough?

432
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:07,250
Yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.

433
01:15:12,410 --> 01:15:14,800
- I'm coming.
- We need a room. - All right.

434
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:17,810
- With a kitchen.
- Do you have one with a kitchen?

435
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:36,390
I am dying for a shower.

436
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:40,900
We should check your bandage, too.

437
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:44,570
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

438
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:50,490
Keep this.

439
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:19,080
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.

440
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,490
Oh but honey. I need to know where I can reach you.

441
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:26,630
You tell me to hide out here at the cabin like
some fugitive and you won't tell me what's going on?

442
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:28,900
I am worried sick here.

443
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:33,570
OK. OK, here's the number.

444
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,990
- You ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.

445
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:42,070
It's 408 555 1439.

446
01:16:42,071 --> 01:16:43,071
Room nine.

447
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,787
- Got it?
- I've got it.

448
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:49,270
I gotta go.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more right now.

449
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,340
I love you, Mom.

450
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:57,180
I love you, too, sweetheart.

451
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:11,750
- Tiki Motel.
- Give me your address there.

452
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,370
What have we got?

453
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:26,130
Moth balls. Corn syrup. Ammonia.

454
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:28,500
What's for dinner?

455
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:31,800
- Plastique.
- That sounds good.

456
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,970
What is it?

457
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:37,780
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.

458
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:40,680
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

459
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:54,400
Make sure there's none on the threads.

460
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:57,950
Like this.

461
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:01,660
Screw the end cap on.

462
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,420
Very gently.

463
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:09,920
You must've had a fun childhood.

464
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:15,340
That's good.

465
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:20,530
All right.
Six more like that and I'll get started on the fuses.

466
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:33,030
He'll find us, won't he?

467
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,320
Probably.

468
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,430
It'll never be over, will it?

469
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:07,600
Look at me. I'm shaking.

470
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:13,920
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.

471
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:18,570
No, I'm not.

472
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:31,710
Kyle, the women in your time,...

473
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,130
...what are they like?

474
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:39,090
Good fighters.

475
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:41,930
That's not what I meant.

476
01:19:43,470 --> 01:19:45,930
Was there someone special?

477
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:49,230
Someone...?

478
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:51,610
A girl, you know.

479
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:55,150
No.

480
01:19:57,490 --> 01:19:59,530
Never.

481
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:02,660
Never?

482
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,500
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

483
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:15,710
So much pain.

484
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,440
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

485
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:24,810
So you feel nothing?

486
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:32,160
John Connor gave me a picture of you once.

487
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:36,820
I didn't know why at the time.

488
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:42,950
It was very old, torn, faded.

489
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:53,230
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.

490
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:58,480
I used to always wonder what you were thinking at that moment.

491
01:20:58,510 --> 01:21:04,180
I memorised every line, every curve.

492
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:11,390
I came across time for you, Sarah.

493
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,730
I love you. I always have.

494
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:36,080
I shouldn't have said that.

495
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:09,090
Think fast.

496
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,640
Trade places.

497
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:53,620
Faster. Drive faster.

498
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:46,420
Kyle. Oh, my God.

499
01:26:54,030 --> 01:26:56,490
You stay here.

500
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,350
Let's get outta here man.

501
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:26,390
Get out.

502
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:45,450
Kyle. Come on. Get up.

503
01:27:51,751 --> 01:27:54,951
He's coming! Kyle!

504
01:27:55,260 --> 01:27:56,630
Come on.

505
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:00,590
Help me. Get out. Get out.

506
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:27,250
Don't stop. Run.

507
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:41,710
Sarah.

508
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,670
Kyle.

509
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:56,190
We did it, Kyle. We got him.

510
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:19,000
No. No.

511
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,230
Wait.

512
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:23,190
What are you doing?

513
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,950
Cover, so he can't track us.

514
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,620
Come on. Come on.

515
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:43,130
No. Kyle. Come on.

516
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,090
- Come on.
- Leave me here.

517
01:32:56,810 --> 01:33:01,440
Move it, Reese. On your feet, soldier.

518
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:05,020
On your feet. Move it.

519
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:19,140
Get back. Go back.

520
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:55,380
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

521
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:57,260
Run.

522
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:02,350
Run.

523
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:05,100
Come on, motherfucker.

524
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:59,380
No.

525
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:00,300
You're terminated, fucker.

526
01:39:57,690 --> 01:39:59,730
Kyle.

527
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:23,750
Tape 7, November 10. Where was l?

528
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,860
What's most difficult for me is trying to
decide what to tell you and what not to.

529
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:33,700
But I guess I have a while yet before you're
old enough to even understand these tapes.

530
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:38,790
They're more for me at this point just so that I can get it straight.

531
01:41:14,640 --> 01:41:16,680
Fill her up.

532
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,730
Should I tell you about your father?

533
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:25,110
Boy, that's a tough one.

534
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:32,380
Will it effect your decision to send him here,
knowing that he is your father?

535
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:36,220
If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.

536
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:39,430
God, a person could go crazy thinking about this.

537
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,460
I suppose I will tell you.

538
01:41:46,590 --> 01:41:48,840
I owe him that.

539
01:41:51,010 --> 01:41:53,470
Maybe it'll help if...

540
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:58,870
...you know that in the few hours that we had together,...

541
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,270
...we loved a lifetime's worth.

542
01:42:15,870 --> 01:42:19,720
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful senora.

543
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:22,930
And he is ashamed to ask you for five American dollars for this picture.

544
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,390
But if he doesn't, his father will beat him.

545
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:29,420
Pretty good hustle, kid.

546
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:47,770
What did he just say?

547
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,980
He said there's a storm coming in.

548
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:56,530
I know.
