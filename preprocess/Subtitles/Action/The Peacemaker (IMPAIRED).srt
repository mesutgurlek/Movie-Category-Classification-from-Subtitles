Dr. Kelly, perhaps you should discuss
Special Op possibilities ?

You see these blobs right here

Those are people jumping off
the passenger train before it crashes.

Are you suggesting
this was a robbery ?

I'm suggesting that
whoever did this...

193
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:26,127
had access to Russian satellite
positioning intel.

You don't do that unless you're trying
to make a very profound statement.

Do you know how much a functioning nuke
is worth on the open market ?

200

Minimum $200 million, cash.

201

$200 million makes for
a very profound statement.

The detonation was a smoke screen.
