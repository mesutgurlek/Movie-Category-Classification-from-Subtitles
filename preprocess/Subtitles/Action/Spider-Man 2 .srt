1
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,487
She looks at me every day.

2
00:02:56,648 --> 00:02:58,371
Mary Jane Watson.

3
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:02,398
Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.

4
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:04,291
But she can never know.

5
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:07,751
I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.

6
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:10,116
A life she can never be a part of.

7
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:11,524
Who am I?

8
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:14,176
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.

9
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:17,214
And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.

10
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:18,878
Parker! Parker!

11
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:21,191
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:25,121
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

13
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,104
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:28,265 --> 00:03:30,436
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,283
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:36,864
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:39,815
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

18
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:42,791
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

19
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:45,506
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

20
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:48,934
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

21
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,674
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

22
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:54,821
This is your last chance.

23
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:59,524
You have to go 42 blocks
in 71 l2 minutes or your ass is fired.

24
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:02,983
Go!

25
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:25,823
Hey, what, are you stupid?

26
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,923
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

27
00:04:58,281 --> 00:04:59,808
I'm gonna get it!

28
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:17,030
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

29
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:18,404
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

30
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:20,291
See you.

31
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:22,628
Way to go, Spidey!

32
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:15,176
Pizza time.

33
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:21,249
You're late.

34
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:23,431
I'm not paying for those.

35
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:44,480
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

36
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:49,088
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

37
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,169
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

38
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:53,674
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.

39
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:56,355
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.

40
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,375
You're fired.

41
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:06,859
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?

42
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,681
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?

43
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:10,250
Dogs catching Frisbees?

44
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:12,615
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

45
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:13,957
- Boss.
- Not now.

46
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:16,742
The Bugle could show another side
of New York for a change.

47
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:19,721
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

48
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:23,145
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you... Still not now!

49
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:25,795
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

50
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:29,312
He won't let me take any more pictures.
You turned the whole city against him.

51
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:30,913
A fact I'm very proud of.

52
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,695
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

53
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:38,088
- It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
- Thanks for the good news.

54
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:41,448
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.

55
00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:44,520
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

56
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:46,309
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

57
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:49,028
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

58
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:50,984
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

59
00:07:51,148 --> 00:07:53,417
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous.

60
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,369
All right, Mr. Jameson.

61
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:59,076
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

62
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:00,804
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

63
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:02,378
I told you, he's not a menace.

64
00:08:02,604 --> 00:08:04,229
- I told you...
- I'll take care of it.

65
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:05,890
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.

66
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:07,494
That's outrageous.

67
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,547
Done. Give this to the girl.

68
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:10,918
Thank you. Bye-bye.

69
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:12,737
Hi.

70
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:14,346
Hey, Pete.

71
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:20,905
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

72
00:08:21,227 --> 00:08:23,115
- Right.
- Sorry.

73
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:25,445
Hey.

74
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:27,426
Chin up, okay?

75
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:41,418
Watch it, jerk!

76
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,449
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

77
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:55,140
Where were you headed, Parker?

78
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:56,550
To your class.

79
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:58,472
My class is over.

80
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,741
See me standing here?

81
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:04,553
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

82
00:09:04,717 --> 00:09:05,993
Then be here.

83
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:08,715
Look at you, Peter.

84
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:13,385
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

85
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:16,331
You always appear exhausted.

86
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,684
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

87
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:22,852
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

88
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:26,053
Planning is not a major
at this university.

89
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:31,170
Octavius is a friend of mine.

90
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,411
Better do your research, Parker.

91
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,774
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

92
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:59,365
Surprise!

93
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,388
Well, say something.

94
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:02,759
What's the occasion?

95
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:05,381
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

96
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:08,585
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

97
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,105
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

98
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:14,124
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.

99
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:15,915
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

100
00:10:16,077 --> 00:10:17,255
Long time, no see.

101
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,125
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

102
00:10:21,293 --> 00:10:22,919
It's going fine. It's going good.

103
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:24,296
She's brilliant in it.

104
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:26,055
Harry sent me roses.

105
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:28,677
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

106
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:31,882
I've been busy.

107
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:35,460
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

108
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:37,517
The less you see of that man,
the better.

109
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,994
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

110
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,376
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

111
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,582
So how are things going at Oscorp?

112
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,499
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

113
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:49,701
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

114
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:53,894
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

115
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:55,306
Thank you.

116
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:59,239
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

117
00:10:59,406 --> 00:11:01,795
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?

118
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:03,176
You'd introduce me?

119
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:06,408
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...

120
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:08,516
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

121
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:10,541
M.J., could you give me a hand?

122
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:14,341
She's waiting for you, pal.

123
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:16,200
What do you mean?

124
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:18,733
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

125
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:20,555
However you want to look at it.

126
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,982
I don't have time for girls right now.

127
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,427
Why, are you dead?

128
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,019
I've been kind of busy.

129
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:27,815
Taking pictures of your friend?

130
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,692
Could we get off that subject?

131
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:34,052
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

132
00:11:34,222 --> 00:11:35,783
Then be honest with me.

133
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,540
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

134
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,628
May.

135
00:12:02,798 --> 00:12:04,293
Oh, what, Ben?

136
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,437
Wait.

137
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:09,004
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.

138
00:12:09,423 --> 00:12:14,409
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

139
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,382
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

140
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,392
Did they have a good time?

141
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:22,089
I'm sure they did.

142
00:12:23,855 --> 00:12:27,532
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.

143
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:33,064
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

144
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:34,889
I'm worried about you.

145
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:40,012
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

146
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:42,628
Oh, my. You did?

147
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,395
Oh, well.

148
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,934
So?

149
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:48,040
I'm a little behind.

150
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,665
Everybody is.

151
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:54,191
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

152
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:57,930
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

153
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:02,020
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

154
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:03,942
You need it more than I do.

155
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:06,533
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!

156
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:08,646
You can take this money from me.

157
00:13:08,816 --> 00:13:11,434
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

158
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,989
And don't you dare leave it here.

159
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,014
Oh, I'm sorry.

160
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:20,550
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.

161
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:27,278
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

162
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,625
I think to myself at times...

163
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:36,876
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

164
00:13:37,872 --> 00:13:39,814
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

165
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:47,623
Now...

166
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:52,074
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.

167
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:07,654
Hey.

168
00:14:07,824 --> 00:14:09,897
Hey. You're still here.

169
00:14:10,928 --> 00:14:12,521
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

170
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:15,851
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

171
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:19,945
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

172
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:24,781
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

173
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:28,619
Oh, boy, yeah.

174
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:32,047
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

175
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:37,962
Nothing.

176
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:43,919
Do you want to say something?

177
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,207
I...

178
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:58,123
...was...

179
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:02,220
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.

180
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,935
You're such a mystery.

181
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:24,493
Peter.

182
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,303
What?

183
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:33,739
Happy birthday.

184
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,138
I'm seeing somebody now.

185
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:47,022
You mean, like a boyfriend?

186
00:15:47,185 --> 00:15:49,738
Well, like I like him.

187
00:15:52,849 --> 00:15:54,093
What?

188
00:15:54,898 --> 00:15:56,392
Nothing.

189
00:15:57,233 --> 00:16:00,332
That's good, you know?
Companionship...

190
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,563
May be more than that.

191
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,120
More?

192
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,207
I don't know.

193
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,628
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

194
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:17,393
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.

195
00:16:18,322 --> 00:16:19,947
Don't disappoint me.

196
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,923
I won't.

197
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,992
Rent.

198
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:44,235
- Hi.
- Hi. What's "hi"?

199
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:45,864
Can I spend it?

200
00:16:46,578 --> 00:16:48,400
I have a paycheck due this week
and...

201
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:51,759
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as...

202
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:55,280
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

203
00:16:55,858 --> 00:17:00,168
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All I got
is this 20 for the rest of the week.

204
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:02,280
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

205
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:07,120
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

206
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:11,504
- Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
- Hi, Pete.

207
00:17:56,403 --> 00:17:57,930
Hello?

208
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,637
Rent?

209
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:13,808
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

210
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:17,713
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

211
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:19,563
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

212
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,454
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.

213
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:22,863
Who do we have here?

214
00:18:23,027 --> 00:18:24,685
This is my good friend
I called you about.

215
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:26,444
He got me through
high-school science.

216
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:29,481
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for...

217
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,026
I know what you're doing here...

218
00:18:31,188 --> 00:18:33,359
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.

219
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,047
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...

220
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:38,448
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

221
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:41,841
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

222
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:46,411
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

223
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:50,441
Interesting fellow, your friend.

224
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,652
I won't take much of your time.

225
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:57,009
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

226
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,787
He also tells me you're lazy.

227
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:01,933
I'm trying to do better.

228
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,548
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

229
00:19:05,876 --> 00:19:08,909
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

230
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:11,116
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

231
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,691
You want to try it back there?

232
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:14,986
So is that it?

233
00:19:15,156 --> 00:19:19,378
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

234
00:19:19,796 --> 00:19:22,545
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

235
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,017
Sympathetic frequencies.

236
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,122
Harmonic reinforcement?

237
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:28,111
Go on.

238
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,043
An exponential increase
in energy output.

239
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,805
A huge amount of energy.

240
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:37,966
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

241
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:41,231
Are you sure you could stabilize
the fusion reaction?

242
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:44,593
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

243
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:46,992
This is my life's work.

244
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,351
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

245
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:52,687
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.

246
00:19:52,852 --> 00:19:56,081
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

247
00:19:56,276 --> 00:19:57,999
You can sleep soundly tonight.

248
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,823
Otto's done his homework.

249
00:19:59,988 --> 00:20:02,956
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

250
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,517
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

251
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:07,757
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

252
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:10,449
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

253
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:12,653
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?

254
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:15,985
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

255
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:18,538
Rosie, I love this boy.

256
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:22,321
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

257
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:24,843
Well...

258
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:27,251
I don't really know.

259
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:30,380
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

260
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:33,460
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

261
00:20:33,621 --> 00:20:35,443
Love should never be a secret.

262
00:20:35,605 --> 00:20:38,736
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

263
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:41,005
...gonna make you sick.

264
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:43,345
I finally got lucky in love.

265
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:44,786
We both did.

266
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:48,494
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

267
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:52,207
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

268
00:20:52,373 --> 00:20:55,504
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

269
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:58,703
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

270
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,259
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

271
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:04,372
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

272
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:05,711
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.

273
00:21:05,877 --> 00:21:09,260
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

274
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:13,588
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

275
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:15,183
Poetry.

276
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:17,743
Never fails.

277
00:21:22,133 --> 00:21:24,948
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie

278
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:27,378
Brightest green were all her garments

279
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,810
And her hair was like the sunshine

280
00:21:30,198 --> 00:21:32,751
Day by day he gazed upon her

281
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,199
Rent!

282
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:32,656
Where is my money?!

283
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,474
You seem jittery tonight.

284
00:22:59,638 --> 00:23:01,329
You never know who's coming.

285
00:23:16,055 --> 00:23:18,903
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

286
00:23:35,383 --> 00:23:36,660
How'd you do that?

287
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,747
Work out, plenty of rest.

288
00:23:41,976 --> 00:23:43,764
You know, eat your green vegetables.

289
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,015
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

290
00:23:50,712 --> 00:23:52,021
Come on. Go.

291
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,181
Keep it steady.

292
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:19,213
It's a web.

293
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:21,873
Go, Spidey, go!

294
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,836
We got trouble!

295
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,583
Get me down!

296
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,973
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

297
00:24:54,136 --> 00:24:57,300
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

298
00:24:57,465 --> 00:24:59,504
Then you think we should
forgive them?

299
00:25:02,265 --> 00:25:03,858
Yes.

300
00:25:04,344 --> 00:25:05,773
I mean, no.

301
00:25:09,912 --> 00:25:14,003
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

302
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:15,924
Whatever.

303
00:25:18,425 --> 00:25:19,951
Shoelace.

304
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:25,841
You might want to...

305
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:34,993
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I've come to see the show.

306
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,805
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

307
00:25:39,993 --> 00:25:42,197
It helps maintain the illusion.

308
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:46,776
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

309
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:48,365
But not to come late.

310
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:54,030
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the...

311
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:09,240
A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man

312
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,271
A-does whatever a spider can

313
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:15,311
A-spins a web, any size

314
00:26:15,481 --> 00:26:17,750
Catches thieves a-just like flies

315
00:26:17,913 --> 00:26:21,011
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

316
00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:38,672
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

317
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:40,150
Yeah, I'm sure.

318
00:26:40,313 --> 00:26:42,136
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.

319
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:43,956
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.

320
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,817
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

321
00:26:50,074 --> 00:26:51,350
What are you doing here?

322
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,028
You hungry?

323
00:27:07,194 --> 00:27:08,371
Starved.

324
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,777
What was that?

325
00:28:03,066 --> 00:28:04,757
Okay.

326
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:44,178
Cool Spidey outfit.

327
00:28:45,947 --> 00:28:47,125
Thanks.

328
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:50,261
Where'd you get it?

329
00:28:51,547 --> 00:28:52,824
I made it.

330
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,161
Looks uncomfortable.

331
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:01,523
Yeah, it gets kind of itchy.

332
00:29:04,603 --> 00:29:07,538
And it rides up in the crotch
a little bit too.

333
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,445
Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.

334
00:30:00,284 --> 00:30:01,461
Hi, M.J.

335
00:30:01,628 --> 00:30:02,872
This is Peter.

336
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:06,323
I was on my way to your show and...

337
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,875
Well, I was on my bike...

338
00:30:13,756 --> 00:30:15,218
Are you there?

339
00:30:17,757 --> 00:30:20,506
I really was planning on it all day.

340
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:23,218
And...

341
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,809
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

342
00:30:27,132 --> 00:30:28,693
Bingo.

343
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,286
It's amazing, isn't it?

344
00:30:32,157 --> 00:30:34,906
How complicated a simple thing...

345
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,988
...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.

346
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:47,419
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.

347
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:51,061
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

348
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:52,690
Your time has expired.

349
00:30:52,861 --> 00:30:56,919
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.

350
00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:08,244
I wanna tell you the truth.

351
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,675
Here it is.

352
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:14,229
I'm Spider-Man.

353
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:16,666
Weird, huh?

354
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,665
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

355
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:26,230
If my enemies found out about you...

356
00:31:28,957 --> 00:31:32,055
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

357
00:31:37,693 --> 00:31:40,562
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

358
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:52,824
Ladies and gentlemen...

359
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:56,667
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

360
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,423
But first, before we start...

361
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:02,780
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

362
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:04,627
Because we found the rubber band.

363
00:32:09,118 --> 00:32:10,492
It's a terrible joke.

364
00:32:10,653 --> 00:32:12,312
But thank you for coming.

365
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:13,815
Today...

366
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:18,324
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

367
00:32:18,621 --> 00:32:23,607
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

368
00:32:24,893 --> 00:32:28,025
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

369
00:32:35,326 --> 00:32:38,195
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

370
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:41,683
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

371
00:32:41,854 --> 00:32:44,276
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

372
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:31,706
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

373
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:35,034
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

374
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:39,127
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

375
00:33:39,295 --> 00:33:42,012
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.

376
00:33:42,175 --> 00:33:44,509
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...

377
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,394
...is as advanced as you suggest...

378
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,501
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

379
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,881
How right you are.

380
00:33:50,047 --> 00:33:52,021
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...

381
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:54,460
...to protect
my higher brain function.

382
00:33:54,622 --> 00:33:58,900
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

383
00:33:59,678 --> 00:34:01,434
And now on to the main event.

384
00:34:01,598 --> 00:34:03,421
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

385
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,916
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

386
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,079
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

387
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:33,721
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.

388
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:35,707
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

389
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:50,420
Ladies and gentlemen...

390
00:34:52,895 --> 00:34:54,651
...fasten your seat belts.

391
00:35:12,672 --> 00:35:15,127
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

392
00:35:19,711 --> 00:35:22,908
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

393
00:35:23,072 --> 00:35:24,250
Thank you.

394
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,238
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

395
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,388
The power of the sun...

396
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,040
...in the palm of my hand.

397
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:01,239
Keep calm! It's only a spike!

398
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,164
lt'll soon stabilize!

399
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:11,292
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.

400
00:36:16,864 --> 00:36:18,206
We have a containment breach!

401
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:22,808
Otto, please get back!

402
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:26,461
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

403
00:36:26,816 --> 00:36:29,337
It will stabilize! It's under control!

404
00:36:29,505 --> 00:36:31,293
I'm in charge here!

405
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:34,173
It's my money! I'm in con...

406
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:39,575
This doesn't change anything.

407
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:45,056
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.

408
00:36:45,441 --> 00:36:46,619
No!

409
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:06,296
Rosie!

410
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:36,859
Watch it.

411
00:37:37,026 --> 00:37:38,203
That was too close.

412
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:42,264
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

413
00:37:47,457 --> 00:37:48,799
I'm ruined.

414
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:52,791
I have nothing left,
except Spider-Man.

415
00:37:52,961 --> 00:37:54,554
He saved your life, sir.

416
00:37:54,977 --> 00:37:57,279
He humiliated me by touching me.

417
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,930
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

418
00:38:00,098 --> 00:38:01,920
What was he doing here anyway?

419
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:20,000
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

420
00:38:20,162 --> 00:38:22,202
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...

421
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,825
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

422
00:38:24,994 --> 00:38:27,066
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

423
00:38:27,234 --> 00:38:30,081
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

424
00:38:30,243 --> 00:38:32,512
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...

425
00:38:32,674 --> 00:38:35,805
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C 7-T1 to T12.

426
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:37,310
We're ready, doctor.

427
00:38:40,482 --> 00:38:42,238
Anybody here take shop class?

428
00:39:23,267 --> 00:39:25,471
Help me! Help me!

429
00:40:33,635 --> 00:40:36,984
No!

430
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,090
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumors.

431
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,325
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

432
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:34,175
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

433
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,210
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

434
00:41:37,668 --> 00:41:42,141
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

435
00:41:42,308 --> 00:41:43,486
Hoffman!

436
00:41:45,444 --> 00:41:46,819
What are we gonna call this guy?

437
00:41:46,981 --> 00:41:49,152
- "Dr. Octopus."
- That's crap.

438
00:41:49,317 --> 00:41:50,811
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!

439
00:41:51,396 --> 00:41:52,989
- "Dr. Strange."
- That's pretty good.

440
00:41:53,765 --> 00:41:57,791
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

441
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:00,158
- I like it.
- Of course you do.

442
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:03,903
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

443
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:05,979
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?

444
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,741
Get out.

445
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,631
Chief, I found Parker.

446
00:42:09,797 --> 00:42:11,902
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.

447
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:14,272
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

448
00:42:14,436 --> 00:42:15,680
I heard Spider-Man was there.

449
00:42:16,805 --> 00:42:19,293
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

450
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:20,705
Chief, the planetarium party.

451
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:22,494
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

452
00:42:22,661 --> 00:42:24,156
What do you know
about high society?

453
00:42:24,325 --> 00:42:26,529
- Oh. Well, l...
- Don't answer that.

454
00:42:26,693 --> 00:42:29,988
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

455
00:42:30,149 --> 00:42:32,996
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

456
00:42:33,157 --> 00:42:34,848
Could you pay me in advance?

457
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:45,860
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

458
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,574
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.

459
00:43:03,045 --> 00:43:04,703
My Rosie's dead.

460
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:08,480
My dream is dead.

461
00:43:12,037 --> 00:43:13,248
And these...

462
00:43:15,173 --> 00:43:18,522
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

463
00:43:21,254 --> 00:43:22,595
...along with me.

464
00:43:31,174 --> 00:43:32,735
Something...

465
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,579
...in my head.

466
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,605
Something talking.

467
00:43:44,486 --> 00:43:45,893
The inhibitor chip!

468
00:43:49,158 --> 00:43:50,652
Gone.

469
00:43:55,238 --> 00:43:56,482
Rebuild.

470
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,343
No.

471
00:44:02,503 --> 00:44:03,877
Peter was right.

472
00:44:06,118 --> 00:44:07,645
I miscalculated.

473
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:15,933
I couldn't have miscalculated.

474
00:44:16,999 --> 00:44:18,853
It was working, wasn't it?

475
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:24,900
Yes.

476
00:44:25,926 --> 00:44:28,796
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

477
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:31,138
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

478
00:44:31,974 --> 00:44:33,730
But we need money.

479
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:36,707
Steal it?

480
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,626
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

481
00:44:41,126 --> 00:44:42,403
That's right.

482
00:44:44,231 --> 00:44:47,330
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

483
00:44:50,823 --> 00:44:52,383
We'll do it here.

484
00:44:53,095 --> 00:44:56,258
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

485
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:58,940
Nothing will stand in our way.

486
00:44:59,111 --> 00:45:00,387
Nothing!

487
00:45:05,607 --> 00:45:08,095
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.

488
00:45:08,391 --> 00:45:10,017
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

489
00:45:10,183 --> 00:45:12,322
Yes, but I'm afraid...

490
00:45:12,488 --> 00:45:15,455
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

491
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:19,100
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

492
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:20,514
You are?

493
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:28,546
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...

494
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:31,199
...a new supersaver account
with us today.

495
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:32,578
But the fact is...

496
00:45:32,744 --> 00:45:36,900
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

497
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:39,005
Well...

498
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:42,467
At least we get the toaster.

499
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:46,494
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

500
00:45:49,223 --> 00:45:50,500
Oh, yes, I see.

501
00:45:51,911 --> 00:45:53,472
Okay.

502
00:45:56,424 --> 00:45:58,431
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

503
00:46:15,047 --> 00:46:16,324
Peter?

504
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:19,934
Don't leave me.

505
00:46:20,712 --> 00:46:23,046
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

506
00:46:23,528 --> 00:46:24,706
Hold it!

507
00:46:25,448 --> 00:46:28,001
Put your arms up! All of them!

508
00:46:50,344 --> 00:46:51,588
Here's your change!

509
00:47:01,161 --> 00:47:02,655
Oh, no. Come on!

510
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:17,570
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.

511
00:47:17,737 --> 00:47:19,264
Not anymore.

512
00:47:47,817 --> 00:47:49,507
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!

513
00:47:53,289 --> 00:47:55,045
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.

514
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:00,484
Wait a second.

515
00:48:17,481 --> 00:48:19,685
- Hand her over.
- Of course.

516
00:48:20,394 --> 00:48:21,604
Easy, now.

517
00:48:23,241 --> 00:48:24,867
Butterfingers.

518
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:37,860
Look out!

519
00:48:40,009 --> 00:48:41,831
Help me!

520
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:46,337
- Help me!
- I'm coming!

521
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,192
Hang on!

522
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,592
Help!

523
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,227
Thank you.

524
00:49:35,338 --> 00:49:36,614
Aunt May.

525
00:49:36,778 --> 00:49:39,648
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

526
00:49:39,819 --> 00:49:42,721
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

527
00:49:48,043 --> 00:49:49,603
Come on.

528
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:55,458
Shame on you.

529
00:50:26,571 --> 00:50:28,131
There you go.

530
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:32,263
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

531
00:50:32,427 --> 00:50:33,637
We sure showed him.

532
00:50:33,803 --> 00:50:35,494
What do you mean, "we"?

533
00:50:39,467 --> 00:50:41,736
- Take me with you, Spider-Man.
- Take me.

534
00:51:08,044 --> 00:51:10,597
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.

535
00:51:11,564 --> 00:51:13,386
Penny! Over here!

536
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,001
Leave it.

537
00:51:23,884 --> 00:51:26,273
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

538
00:51:26,443 --> 00:51:27,720
Why? It's a party.

539
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:30,699
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...

540
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,056
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

541
00:51:34,444 --> 00:51:36,037
Not to mention your friend the bug.

542
00:51:36,588 --> 00:51:37,766
Not tonight, Harry.

543
00:51:37,932 --> 00:51:41,248
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24-7.

544
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,114
Parker!

545
00:51:43,756 --> 00:51:44,934
Parker!

546
00:51:45,452 --> 00:51:48,386
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

547
00:51:48,556 --> 00:51:50,411
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?

548
00:51:50,636 --> 00:51:52,524
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.

549
00:51:52,908 --> 00:51:54,119
Beautiful tie.

550
00:51:54,284 --> 00:51:56,455
Get a shot of us with the DA.

551
00:51:56,844 --> 00:51:58,273
Beautiful dress.

552
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,318
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

553
00:52:02,604 --> 00:52:04,131
Wife.

554
00:52:06,028 --> 00:52:08,232
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

555
00:52:08,396 --> 00:52:11,331
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...

556
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:13,639
...is pleased to present
our guest of honor.

557
00:52:13,804 --> 00:52:17,382
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

558
00:52:18,444 --> 00:52:21,478
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

559
00:52:21,644 --> 00:52:23,433
...Captain John Jameson.

560
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:07,746
Hi.

561
00:53:09,965 --> 00:53:13,194
- You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.

562
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,396
But there was a disturbance.

563
00:53:15,629 --> 00:53:16,905
I don't know you.

564
00:53:18,797 --> 00:53:22,572
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

565
00:53:23,405 --> 00:53:25,031
I've been reading poetry lately.

566
00:53:25,197 --> 00:53:26,539
Whatever that means.

567
00:53:26,989 --> 00:53:30,372
Day by day he gazed upon her

568
00:53:30,765 --> 00:53:33,482
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day...

569
00:53:33,645 --> 00:53:35,434
Don't start.

570
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,439
Can I get you a drink?

571
00:53:38,669 --> 00:53:40,392
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.

572
00:53:41,038 --> 00:53:42,598
John.

573
00:53:42,765 --> 00:53:46,507
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

574
00:53:46,669 --> 00:53:49,517
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

575
00:53:49,678 --> 00:53:52,067
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

576
00:53:52,237 --> 00:53:53,415
Even my father.

577
00:53:54,605 --> 00:53:57,191
He came backstage to borrow cash.

578
00:53:58,766 --> 00:54:02,956
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

579
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:05,190
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.

580
00:54:06,798 --> 00:54:08,325
After all these years...

581
00:54:09,582 --> 00:54:12,070
...he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.

582
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:39,755
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

583
00:54:39,918 --> 00:54:43,049
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

584
00:54:43,214 --> 00:54:45,124
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.

585
00:54:45,294 --> 00:54:47,083
Don't act like you're my friend.

586
00:54:47,822 --> 00:54:49,710
You stole M.J. from me.

587
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,917
You stole my father's love.

588
00:54:52,558 --> 00:54:57,348
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

589
00:54:58,543 --> 00:55:00,681
Huh? Isn't that right?

590
00:55:00,846 --> 00:55:02,570
Huh, brother?

591
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:15,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

592
00:55:16,398 --> 00:55:20,676
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

593
00:55:30,767 --> 00:55:32,174
What a surprise.

594
00:55:32,335 --> 00:55:35,117
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

595
00:56:01,103 --> 00:56:03,274
Oh, no. No!

596
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,976
Why is this happening to me?

597
00:57:39,729 --> 00:57:41,616
You seem very okay to me.

598
00:57:42,288 --> 00:57:43,597
My diagnosis?

599
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,487
It's up here.

600
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:51,942
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

601
00:57:53,072 --> 00:57:55,690
There is one dream where...

602
00:57:56,112 --> 00:57:57,519
...in my dream...

603
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,949
...l'm Spider-Man.

604
00:58:00,337 --> 00:58:04,592
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

605
00:58:08,177 --> 00:58:09,704
So you're Spider-Man.

606
00:58:09,873 --> 00:58:11,050
In my dream.

607
00:58:11,216 --> 00:58:15,406
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

608
00:58:17,617 --> 00:58:19,144
Somebody else's dream.

609
00:58:24,689 --> 00:58:26,511
What about this friend?

610
00:58:26,672 --> 00:58:29,869
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

611
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:34,128
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

612
00:58:34,737 --> 00:58:38,349
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

613
00:58:38,513 --> 00:58:40,204
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

614
00:58:40,977 --> 00:58:42,471
Listen...

615
00:58:43,345 --> 00:58:47,403
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

616
00:58:47,825 --> 00:58:49,483
That's why you keep falling.

617
00:58:51,857 --> 00:58:53,712
You always have a choice, Peter.

618
00:58:55,857 --> 00:58:57,483
I have a choice.

619
00:59:06,226 --> 00:59:09,095
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...

620
00:59:10,162 --> 00:59:11,536
...make me sad.

621
00:59:12,977 --> 00:59:14,832
Can't you understand?

622
00:59:15,537 --> 00:59:17,741
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

623
00:59:18,481 --> 00:59:21,449
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

624
00:59:22,034 --> 00:59:24,587
...fairness, justice...

625
00:59:25,297 --> 00:59:29,837
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...

626
00:59:30,097 --> 00:59:33,774
...to take those dreams
out into the world.

627
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:37,288
I can't live your dreams anymore.

628
00:59:38,418 --> 00:59:40,174
I want a life of my own.

629
00:59:40,338 --> 00:59:42,378
You've been given a gift, Peter.

630
00:59:42,673 --> 00:59:46,732
With great power
comes great responsibility.

631
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:52,746
Take my hand, son.

632
01:00:05,458 --> 01:00:07,051
No, Uncle Ben.

633
01:00:09,074 --> 01:00:11,213
I'm just Peter Parker.

634
01:00:12,914 --> 01:00:14,572
I'm Spider-Man...

635
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:16,871
...no more.

636
01:00:18,002 --> 01:00:19,344
No more.

637
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,657
No more.

638
01:01:54,003 --> 01:01:56,076
- You punk!
- Sorry.

639
01:01:56,756 --> 01:01:58,544
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

640
01:02:05,684 --> 01:02:06,861
Hurry up!

641
01:02:16,148 --> 01:02:19,693
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

642
01:02:19,859 --> 01:02:21,518
Someone, please?

643
01:02:23,668 --> 01:02:25,806
.23 electron volts.

644
01:02:30,867 --> 01:02:33,617
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

645
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:43,956
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

646
01:02:43,956 --> 01:02:46,639
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

647
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,521
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

648
01:02:49,684 --> 01:02:51,571
...in a very inexcusable manner.

649
01:02:51,732 --> 01:02:53,805
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

650
01:02:53,972 --> 01:02:57,038
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

651
01:02:57,204 --> 01:02:58,895
That would be hypocrisy.

652
01:02:59,892 --> 01:03:02,194
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

653
01:03:07,764 --> 01:03:09,193
"I am glad."

654
01:03:10,004 --> 01:03:11,946
"I am glad."

655
01:03:12,245 --> 01:03:13,935
"I am glad."

656
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,740
Are you glad to hear it?

657
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:22,097
I am glad...

658
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:23,667
...to hear it.

659
01:03:23,828 --> 01:03:25,454
In fact, now you mention
the subject...

660
01:03:25,621 --> 01:03:29,101
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.

661
01:03:30,964 --> 01:03:33,812
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

662
01:03:33,973 --> 01:03:35,915
You could've told me
you were coming.

663
01:03:36,085 --> 01:03:38,321
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

664
01:03:41,908 --> 01:03:43,501
You look different.

665
01:03:44,213 --> 01:03:48,948
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

666
01:03:49,109 --> 01:03:50,897
I do my homework now.

667
01:03:52,949 --> 01:03:54,705
You wanna get some chow mein?

668
01:03:54,869 --> 01:03:56,211
Peter...

669
01:03:56,629 --> 01:03:58,123
...l'm getting married.

670
01:04:02,869 --> 01:04:05,651
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

671
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:07,534
And who's the groom?

672
01:04:07,861 --> 01:04:09,487
You hadn't decided yet.

673
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:13,836
You think just because
you saw my play...

674
01:04:14,005 --> 01:04:16,307
...you can talk me out
of getting married?

675
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:19,632
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

676
01:04:19,797 --> 01:04:23,146
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

677
01:04:23,605 --> 01:04:25,099
You're too late.

678
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:27,475
Will you think about it?

679
01:04:27,637 --> 01:04:28,913
Think about what?

680
01:04:29,077 --> 01:04:30,987
Picking up where we left off.

681
01:04:31,189 --> 01:04:32,433
Where was that?

682
01:04:32,597 --> 01:04:34,986
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

683
01:04:35,158 --> 01:04:36,499
I don't think it's that simple.

684
01:04:36,661 --> 01:04:38,833
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

685
01:04:38,998 --> 01:04:40,558
You don't understand.

686
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:43,380
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

687
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:45,267
I'm different.

688
01:04:45,845 --> 01:04:47,755
Punch me, I bleed.

689
01:04:54,742 --> 01:04:56,171
I have to go.

690
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:05,104
I'm getting married in a church.

691
01:05:12,502 --> 01:05:13,964
You are different.

692
01:05:28,246 --> 01:05:31,246
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

693
01:05:32,022 --> 01:05:34,510
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?

694
01:05:34,678 --> 01:05:37,580
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.

695
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,784
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

696
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:44,365
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.

697
01:05:46,934 --> 01:05:48,690
Where the hell did you get that?

698
01:05:48,854 --> 01:05:50,316
In the garbage.

699
01:05:50,486 --> 01:05:51,861
In the garbage?

700
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,474
He must've given up.

701
01:05:55,766 --> 01:06:00,305
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

702
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:04,209
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

703
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:08,979
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

704
01:06:09,143 --> 01:06:12,078
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.

705
01:06:12,246 --> 01:06:15,149
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.

706
01:06:15,895 --> 01:06:17,782
Your wife is still on that line.

707
01:06:19,127 --> 01:06:20,817
Flowers? How much?

708
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:24,496
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

709
01:06:24,662 --> 01:06:25,873
Get plastic.

710
01:06:26,934 --> 01:06:28,495
Gotta go, big story.

711
01:06:39,127 --> 01:06:42,258
Spider-Man
Spider-Man

712
01:06:42,423 --> 01:06:45,292
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

713
01:06:45,463 --> 01:06:48,725
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?

714
01:06:55,863 --> 01:06:58,100
Come on, man. Get the money.

715
01:06:59,703 --> 01:07:01,459
Come on, come on.

716
01:07:03,735 --> 01:07:05,164
Help!

717
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:10,129
Come on!

718
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:18,514
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.

719
01:07:18,679 --> 01:07:20,752
He was a peaceful man.

720
01:07:22,711 --> 01:07:24,850
And it was all my doing.

721
01:07:56,344 --> 01:07:59,639
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.

722
01:07:59,799 --> 01:08:01,741
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

723
01:08:02,104 --> 01:08:05,170
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...

724
01:08:05,336 --> 01:08:07,409
...and he wanted to drive you.

725
01:08:07,736 --> 01:08:10,157
If only I had stopped him.

726
01:08:10,616 --> 01:08:13,649
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

727
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,221
I'm responsible.

728
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:35,187
For what?

729
01:08:36,152 --> 01:08:38,257
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

730
01:08:38,424 --> 01:08:40,628
But you were at the library.

731
01:08:40,792 --> 01:08:42,647
You were doing your homework.

732
01:08:42,808 --> 01:08:45,808
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

733
01:08:46,617 --> 01:08:48,177
What do you mean?

734
01:08:48,888 --> 01:08:50,481
I went someplace else.

735
01:08:50,648 --> 01:08:53,518
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...

736
01:08:54,649 --> 01:08:57,299
...to buy a car, because I wanted...

737
01:08:58,297 --> 01:09:00,337
...to impress Mary Jane.

738
01:09:02,393 --> 01:09:04,335
It happened so fast.

739
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:09,142
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

740
01:09:10,585 --> 01:09:11,959
The thief...

741
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,808
...was running towards me.

742
01:09:16,345 --> 01:09:19,029
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted...

743
01:09:19,736 --> 01:09:21,198
...revenge.

744
01:09:23,129 --> 01:09:24,590
I let him go.

745
01:09:26,425 --> 01:09:29,240
I let him get away.

746
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:36,564
He wanted a car.

747
01:09:36,729 --> 01:09:38,900
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

748
01:09:40,121 --> 01:09:43,220
Uncle Ben said no...

749
01:09:44,665 --> 01:09:46,738
...and then he shot him.

750
01:09:50,201 --> 01:09:53,714
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

751
01:09:55,289 --> 01:09:58,224
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.

752
01:10:01,306 --> 01:10:02,516
And I...

753
01:10:05,817 --> 01:10:07,759
I held his hand...

754
01:10:08,345 --> 01:10:09,872
...when he died.

755
01:10:17,178 --> 01:10:19,993
I've tried to tell you so many times.

756
01:11:14,267 --> 01:11:16,470
Just one more little chore.

757
01:11:23,674 --> 01:11:25,016
Where are you?

758
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:30,807
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.

759
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:33,589
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

760
01:11:33,754 --> 01:11:35,281
Good night, Bernard.

761
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:27,669
Hello, Harry.

762
01:12:27,835 --> 01:12:29,974
Otto. What do you want?

763
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:32,050
That precious tritium.

764
01:12:32,923 --> 01:12:34,516
But I need more of it this time.

765
01:12:36,187 --> 01:12:40,016
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

766
01:12:43,771 --> 01:12:45,658
Hey! Hey!

767
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,754
Stop! Stop! All right!

768
01:12:49,179 --> 01:12:52,757
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

769
01:13:02,267 --> 01:13:05,399
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

770
01:13:06,203 --> 01:13:09,913
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

771
01:13:10,076 --> 01:13:11,320
How do I find him?

772
01:13:12,508 --> 01:13:14,101
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?

773
01:13:14,268 --> 01:13:16,504
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the Bugle.

774
01:13:16,668 --> 01:13:18,097
Make him tell you where he is.

775
01:13:23,612 --> 01:13:24,889
Have it ready.

776
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,034
Don't hurt Peter!

777
01:13:42,716 --> 01:13:45,051
Somebody, help!

778
01:13:45,948 --> 01:13:47,475
Fire!

779
01:13:55,324 --> 01:13:58,194
Alisa, the Chens can't find their
daughter. Have you seen her?

780
01:13:59,549 --> 01:14:02,036
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!

781
01:14:02,781 --> 01:14:04,985
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?

782
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:07,636
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

783
01:14:07,868 --> 01:14:09,461
Hey, where you going?!

784
01:14:29,789 --> 01:14:31,130
I'm coming!

785
01:14:54,653 --> 01:14:57,336
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

786
01:14:57,501 --> 01:14:59,890
Come on. Come on.

787
01:15:57,693 --> 01:15:59,581
Mama.

788
01:16:11,102 --> 01:16:12,596
You got some guts, kid.

789
01:16:12,766 --> 01:16:17,174
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.

790
01:16:17,437 --> 01:16:18,844
Oh, man.

791
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:24,947
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

792
01:16:25,118 --> 01:16:28,827
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

793
01:16:34,302 --> 01:16:37,172
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

794
01:16:38,142 --> 01:16:39,549
What I need?

795
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:44,125
What am I supposed to do?

796
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:51,988
I shouldn't have without...

797
01:16:52,606 --> 01:16:53,816
...knocking.

798
01:16:58,207 --> 01:16:59,734
Come in.

799
01:17:02,687 --> 01:17:05,076
- Hi.
- Hi.

800
01:17:08,607 --> 01:17:11,095
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

801
01:17:13,022 --> 01:17:14,233
Okay.

802
01:17:15,775 --> 01:17:17,433
And a glass of milk?

803
01:17:20,383 --> 01:17:21,910
That would be nice.

804
01:17:23,775 --> 01:17:25,815
Okay.

805
01:17:45,183 --> 01:17:46,939
Thank you.

806
01:17:51,519 --> 01:17:53,013
You got a message.

807
01:17:54,144 --> 01:17:55,550
It's your aunt.

808
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:57,402
Thanks.

809
01:18:12,832 --> 01:18:14,108
What's going on?

810
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:17,916
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

811
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,593
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

812
01:18:21,824 --> 01:18:23,165
Why didn't you tell me?

813
01:18:23,328 --> 01:18:26,491
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

814
01:18:26,655 --> 01:18:29,917
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...

815
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:31,508
...and I'm giving him $5.

816
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,207
That's Henry Jackson?

817
01:18:33,856 --> 01:18:35,863
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.

818
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:39,455
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

819
01:18:41,056 --> 01:18:44,089
Listen, about my last visit...

820
01:18:44,384 --> 01:18:46,620
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

821
01:18:46,784 --> 01:18:51,159
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

822
01:18:54,496 --> 01:18:58,140
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

823
01:18:58,367 --> 01:19:00,156
And I'm proud of you.

824
01:19:01,184 --> 01:19:03,486
And I thank you, and I...

825
01:19:04,704 --> 01:19:06,940
I love you, Peter.

826
01:19:08,128 --> 01:19:10,549
So very, very much.

827
01:19:29,216 --> 01:19:32,086
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

828
01:19:32,257 --> 01:19:35,071
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

829
01:19:37,952 --> 01:19:41,084
- I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you, Henry.

830
01:19:41,249 --> 01:19:42,710
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.

831
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:44,188
You're getting tall.

832
01:19:44,352 --> 01:19:48,280
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

833
01:19:48,448 --> 01:19:51,416
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

834
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:53,532
I used to.

835
01:19:53,696 --> 01:19:54,874
Where is he?

836
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:59,197
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

837
01:20:01,024 --> 01:20:02,486
He...

838
01:20:04,512 --> 01:20:06,901
...quit.
- Why?

839
01:20:07,744 --> 01:20:09,567
Wanted to try other things.

840
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:11,223
He'll be back, right?

841
01:20:12,513 --> 01:20:13,723
I don't know.

842
01:20:15,105 --> 01:20:17,975
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

843
01:20:18,369 --> 01:20:20,060
Spider-Man.

844
01:20:20,225 --> 01:20:23,967
- Why?
- He knows a hero when he sees one.

845
01:20:24,129 --> 01:20:27,707
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...

846
01:20:27,873 --> 01:20:29,815
...saving old girls like me.

847
01:20:29,985 --> 01:20:33,629
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

848
01:20:33,793 --> 01:20:36,543
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...

849
01:20:36,705 --> 01:20:38,941
...setting examples for all of us.

850
01:20:39,393 --> 01:20:41,630
Everybody loves a hero.

851
01:20:41,985 --> 01:20:45,281
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

852
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:49,434
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...

853
01:20:49,601 --> 01:20:51,227
...just to get a glimpse of the one...

854
01:20:51,394 --> 01:20:54,710
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

855
01:20:56,001 --> 01:20:59,100
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

856
01:20:59,841 --> 01:21:01,597
...that keeps us honest...

857
01:21:02,242 --> 01:21:03,736
...gives us strength...

858
01:21:04,162 --> 01:21:05,950
...makes us noble...

859
01:21:07,009 --> 01:21:10,392
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.

860
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:15,482
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...

861
01:21:15,649 --> 01:21:18,300
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

862
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:21,824
Even our dreams.

863
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:26,268
Spider-Man did that for Henry...

864
01:21:26,434 --> 01:21:28,768
...and he wonders where he's gone.

865
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:31,614
He needs him.

866
01:21:35,906 --> 01:21:40,445
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

867
01:21:40,866 --> 01:21:42,971
But don't strain yourself.

868
01:21:43,138 --> 01:21:44,698
Okay.

869
01:22:02,658 --> 01:22:04,797
Strong focus on what I want.

870
01:22:33,603 --> 01:22:35,097
I'm back!

871
01:22:35,267 --> 01:22:36,609
I'm back!

872
01:22:53,474 --> 01:22:54,816
My back.

873
01:22:55,715 --> 01:22:57,024
My back.

874
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:24,352
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

875
01:23:24,867 --> 01:23:26,077
Peter Parker?

876
01:23:28,163 --> 01:23:29,341
Positive.

877
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:30,749
Thought he was your pal.

878
01:23:31,075 --> 01:23:33,312
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.

879
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:36,667
He's just a great big jerk.

880
01:23:36,931 --> 01:23:38,720
The world's full of great big jerks.

881
01:23:40,163 --> 01:23:41,854
You're adorable.

882
01:23:42,243 --> 01:23:43,770
It's just the uniform.

883
01:23:46,947 --> 01:23:48,955
Lean your head back for me.

884
01:23:49,251 --> 01:23:51,585
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.

885
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:55,133
Just put my head back?

886
01:23:55,844 --> 01:23:57,370
Okay.

887
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:17,112
Wow.

888
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:19,550
I'm back on the moon.

889
01:24:24,004 --> 01:24:25,433
You up there with me?

890
01:24:45,381 --> 01:24:47,453
- Hiya.
- Surprised?

891
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:49,049
Very.

892
01:24:49,221 --> 01:24:50,715
Thanks for coming.

893
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:52,899
Everything okay?

894
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:55,519
You might say so.

895
01:24:56,804 --> 01:25:00,416
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

896
01:25:02,757 --> 01:25:05,244
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

897
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:09,442
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.

898
01:25:10,981 --> 01:25:14,494
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...

899
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:18,043
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.

900
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:20,826
I was afraid to trust you.

901
01:25:22,436 --> 01:25:25,339
But I've been thinking about it...

902
01:25:25,508 --> 01:25:29,021
Listen, there's more for me to say.

903
01:25:32,549 --> 01:25:36,575
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought...

904
01:25:36,741 --> 01:25:39,261
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

905
01:25:39,941 --> 01:25:41,664
I'm saying...

906
01:25:47,589 --> 01:25:50,458
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...

907
01:25:50,981 --> 01:25:52,388
...but I can't.

908
01:25:55,685 --> 01:25:58,784
My mind was playing tricks too.

909
01:26:03,301 --> 01:26:05,788
Do you love me, or not?

910
01:26:12,549 --> 01:26:14,109
I...

911
01:26:17,221 --> 01:26:18,399
...don't.

912
01:26:23,109 --> 01:26:24,964
You don't.

913
01:26:34,118 --> 01:26:35,296
Kiss me.

914
01:26:37,413 --> 01:26:38,842
Kiss you?

915
01:26:39,014 --> 01:26:40,770
I need to know something.

916
01:26:43,269 --> 01:26:44,796
Just one kiss.

917
01:27:29,958 --> 01:27:32,063
What's happening?

918
01:27:41,894 --> 01:27:43,455
Peter Parker...

919
01:27:44,295 --> 01:27:45,888
...and the girlfriend.

920
01:27:46,311 --> 01:27:48,067
What do you want?

921
01:27:50,759 --> 01:27:52,897
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

922
01:27:53,062 --> 01:27:55,583
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

923
01:27:55,751 --> 01:27:57,823
I don't know where he is.

924
01:27:59,303 --> 01:28:00,732
Find him.

925
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:05,667
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

926
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:07,772
If you lay one finger on her...

927
01:28:07,943 --> 01:28:09,220
You'll do what?

928
01:29:19,944 --> 01:29:23,522
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiance.

929
01:29:23,687 --> 01:29:25,214
Sorry, Jonah.

930
01:29:26,248 --> 01:29:27,677
It's all my fault.

931
01:29:29,384 --> 01:29:31,620
I drove Spider-Man away.

932
01:29:31,879 --> 01:29:34,913
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

933
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:37,538
Yes.

934
01:29:39,047 --> 01:29:42,244
Spider-Man was a hero.

935
01:29:43,399 --> 01:29:45,287
I just couldn't see it.

936
01:29:46,824 --> 01:29:48,199
He was a...

937
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,913
A thief! A criminal!

938
01:29:52,424 --> 01:29:54,628
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

939
01:29:54,792 --> 01:29:57,694
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

940
01:29:57,864 --> 01:29:59,871
I want him strung up by his web!

941
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,873
I want Spider-Man!

942
01:30:31,177 --> 01:30:32,486
Where is she?

943
01:30:32,649 --> 01:30:35,169
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

944
01:31:24,297 --> 01:31:25,474
What the hell?

945
01:33:25,322 --> 01:33:27,297
You have a train to catch.

946
01:33:29,706 --> 01:33:31,462
Help!

947
01:33:31,626 --> 01:33:35,816
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

948
01:33:53,835 --> 01:33:56,257
- It's Spider-Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!

949
01:33:56,427 --> 01:33:57,889
Tell everyone to hang on!

950
01:33:58,059 --> 01:33:59,717
Brace yourselves!

951
01:34:20,043 --> 01:34:22,280
Any more bright ideas?

952
01:34:22,635 --> 01:34:24,872
I got a few, yeah!

953
01:34:45,355 --> 01:34:47,079
Whoa, watch out!

954
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,671
We're slowing down.

955
01:36:19,436 --> 01:36:21,324
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

956
01:36:22,285 --> 01:36:23,714
Slower. Gently.

957
01:36:28,749 --> 01:36:30,025
Is he alive?

958
01:36:33,645 --> 01:36:34,823
He's...

959
01:36:34,988 --> 01:36:36,515
...just a kid.

960
01:36:37,645 --> 01:36:39,401
No older than my son.

961
01:36:57,965 --> 01:36:59,689
It's all right.

962
01:37:03,917 --> 01:37:05,673
We found something.

963
01:37:14,669 --> 01:37:16,644
We won't tell nobody.

964
01:37:29,742 --> 01:37:32,163
It's good to have you back,
Spider-Man.

965
01:37:51,342 --> 01:37:53,098
He's mine!

966
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:56,488
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

967
01:37:56,814 --> 01:37:58,090
And me.

968
01:37:58,670 --> 01:37:59,979
Me too.

969
01:38:04,718 --> 01:38:06,213
Very well.

970
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:35,917
Where do you want him?

971
01:38:43,407 --> 01:38:44,836
And the tritium?

972
01:38:58,767 --> 01:39:00,174
Yes.

973
01:39:28,975 --> 01:39:31,910
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

974
01:39:34,543 --> 01:39:36,965
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

975
01:39:37,135 --> 01:39:39,469
I can look into your eyes as you die.

976
01:39:42,127 --> 01:39:43,589
Pete.

977
01:39:43,952 --> 01:39:45,577
No.

978
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:47,501
It can't be.

979
01:39:53,808 --> 01:39:55,052
Harry.

980
01:39:56,528 --> 01:39:59,823
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

981
01:40:01,103 --> 01:40:04,933
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.

982
01:40:05,647 --> 01:40:06,858
Tritium?

983
01:40:08,783 --> 01:40:10,693
He's making the machine again.

984
01:40:11,503 --> 01:40:15,562
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

985
01:40:15,728 --> 01:40:18,379
- Now, where is he?
- Peter...

986
01:40:19,504 --> 01:40:21,260
...you killed my father.

987
01:40:26,224 --> 01:40:30,152
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

988
01:40:30,864 --> 01:40:33,514
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.

989
01:40:43,696 --> 01:40:45,321
Hey!

990
01:40:46,352 --> 01:40:47,945
Hey!

991
01:40:49,296 --> 01:40:50,986
I'm talking to you!

992
01:40:51,312 --> 01:40:54,661
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.

993
01:40:54,832 --> 01:40:56,621
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

994
01:40:56,784 --> 01:40:59,239
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

995
01:41:00,176 --> 01:41:01,550
He's not dead.

996
01:41:01,808 --> 01:41:04,329
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.

997
01:41:21,361 --> 01:41:22,637
Surprise.

998
01:41:26,896 --> 01:41:28,457
As soon as you get free...

999
01:41:30,545 --> 01:41:34,341
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

1000
01:41:34,512 --> 01:41:37,414
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

1001
01:41:37,648 --> 01:41:39,885
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.

1002
01:41:40,976 --> 01:41:42,765
Well, I'm not.

1003
01:42:13,969 --> 01:42:15,147
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1004
01:42:30,449 --> 01:42:31,627
Run!

1005
01:42:55,186 --> 01:42:57,422
Let's see you scurry out of this.

1006
01:43:20,306 --> 01:43:22,445
Now what?

1007
01:43:51,314 --> 01:43:53,354
Dr. Octavius.

1008
01:43:56,435 --> 01:43:57,612
We have to shut it down.

1009
01:43:58,418 --> 01:43:59,912
Please tell me how.

1010
01:44:00,082 --> 01:44:01,456
Peter Parker?

1011
01:44:04,882 --> 01:44:06,824
"Brilliant but lazy."

1012
01:44:07,154 --> 01:44:08,496
Look at what's happening.

1013
01:44:09,459 --> 01:44:11,247
We must destroy it.

1014
01:44:16,658 --> 01:44:18,185
I can't destroy it.

1015
01:44:23,251 --> 01:44:24,527
I won't.

1016
01:44:29,875 --> 01:44:31,980
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

1017
01:44:33,778 --> 01:44:37,324
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1018
01:44:38,963 --> 01:44:40,305
A privilege.

1019
01:44:40,947 --> 01:44:43,882
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1020
01:44:44,883 --> 01:44:46,672
Don't listen to them.

1021
01:44:52,307 --> 01:44:53,801
It was my dream.

1022
01:44:53,971 --> 01:44:58,281
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...

1023
01:44:58,451 --> 01:45:00,872
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

1024
01:45:01,651 --> 01:45:03,244
Even our dreams.

1025
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:10,571
You're right.

1026
01:45:17,684 --> 01:45:19,472
He's right.

1027
01:45:21,139 --> 01:45:22,666
Listen.

1028
01:45:24,787 --> 01:45:26,959
Listen to me now.

1029
01:45:29,748 --> 01:45:31,984
Listen to me now.

1030
01:45:35,539 --> 01:45:38,387
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1031
01:45:39,444 --> 01:45:41,037
It can't be stopped.

1032
01:45:42,388 --> 01:45:44,330
It's self-sustaining now.

1033
01:45:44,564 --> 01:45:46,539
- Think!
- Unless...

1034
01:45:48,052 --> 01:45:49,710
The river.

1035
01:45:51,028 --> 01:45:52,555
Drown it.

1036
01:45:54,452 --> 01:45:55,728
I'll do it.

1037
01:46:39,188 --> 01:46:41,806
No!

1038
01:46:53,333 --> 01:46:54,860
Hi.

1039
01:46:55,508 --> 01:46:57,068
Hi.

1040
01:46:57,844 --> 01:46:59,251
This is really heavy.

1041
01:47:22,805 --> 01:47:24,692
M.J.

1042
01:47:25,461 --> 01:47:27,217
In case we die...

1043
01:47:27,381 --> 01:47:28,875
You do love me.

1044
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:30,638
I do.

1045
01:47:31,573 --> 01:47:33,581
Even though you said you didn't.

1046
01:47:36,373 --> 01:47:38,740
I will not die a monster.

1047
01:48:41,302 --> 01:48:43,277
I think I always knew...

1048
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:45,870
...all this time...

1049
01:48:46,998 --> 01:48:48,721
...who you really were.

1050
01:48:49,302 --> 01:48:51,757
Then you know
why we can't be together.

1051
01:48:52,918 --> 01:48:55,668
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

1052
01:48:57,526 --> 01:49:00,112
I can't let you take that risk.

1053
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:05,939
I will...

1054
01:49:07,542 --> 01:49:09,713
...always be Spider-Man.

1055
01:49:12,374 --> 01:49:14,644
You and I can never be.

1056
01:50:01,046 --> 01:50:02,956
Mary Jane!

1057
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:05,073
Hello?

1058
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:21,716
Who's that?

1059
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:23,735
Son.

1060
01:51:24,792 --> 01:51:26,068
I'm here.

1061
01:51:27,352 --> 01:51:28,912
Dad?

1062
01:51:29,944 --> 01:51:32,049
- I thought you were...
- No.

1063
01:51:32,536 --> 01:51:34,543
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1064
01:51:34,712 --> 01:51:35,890
Now it's your turn.

1065
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:39,953
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.

1066
01:51:40,312 --> 01:51:41,905
Now make him pay.

1067
01:51:42,392 --> 01:51:43,953
But Pete's my best friend.

1068
01:51:44,184 --> 01:51:45,613
And I'm your father.

1069
01:51:46,584 --> 01:51:47,959
You're weak.

1070
01:51:48,920 --> 01:51:53,076
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1071
01:51:54,104 --> 01:51:56,821
Now you know the truth about Peter.

1072
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:59,149
Be strong, Harry.

1073
01:52:00,152 --> 01:52:01,494
Avenge me.

1074
01:52:04,217 --> 01:52:06,159
- Avenge me!
- No!

1075
01:54:24,890 --> 01:54:26,232
Call Deborah.

1076
01:54:26,394 --> 01:54:28,150
The caterer?

1077
01:54:29,114 --> 01:54:31,121
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1078
01:55:10,811 --> 01:55:12,883
Had to do what I had to do.

1079
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:15,767
Mary Jane.

1080
01:55:16,890 --> 01:55:18,101
Peter.

1081
01:55:19,291 --> 01:55:21,625
I can't survive without you.

1082
01:55:31,227 --> 01:55:32,983
You shouldn't be here.

1083
01:55:34,043 --> 01:55:36,978
I know you think we can't be together.

1084
01:55:38,043 --> 01:55:41,556
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1085
01:55:42,779 --> 01:55:44,535
I know there'll be risks.

1086
01:55:45,339 --> 01:55:47,794
But I want to face them with you.

1087
01:55:48,923 --> 01:55:52,152
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...

1088
01:55:52,315 --> 01:55:54,006
...half of ourselves.

1089
01:55:56,379 --> 01:55:57,906
I love you.

1090
01:56:00,123 --> 01:56:02,938
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.

1091
01:56:04,603 --> 01:56:07,570
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

1092
01:56:14,332 --> 01:56:17,714
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

1093
01:56:23,420 --> 01:56:25,176
Well, say something.

1094
01:56:27,579 --> 01:56:29,968
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1095
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:47,191
Go get them, tiger.
