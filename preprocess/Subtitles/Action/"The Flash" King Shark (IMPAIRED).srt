00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,084
Did he say anything to you
about what happened over there?

165
00:08:26,085 --> 00:08:27,718
No, not a thing. You?

166
00:08:31,924 --> 00:08:33,024
Hmm.

167
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,008
Hey, so... I been thinking.

168
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,838
You've been working around the clock.

169
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:48,907
Maybe you want to get some rest, go home.

170
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:50,141
You know, a good night's sleep wouldn't be

171
00:08:50,142 --> 00:08:51,276
the worst thing in the world.

172
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:52,377
I'm fine.

173
00:08:52,778 --> 00:08:53,871
Look, I get it.

174
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:55,272
You're having a hard
time with what happened.

175
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:56,974
It's a lot to take so soon after...

176
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:58,275
I said I'm fine.

177
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:08,185
Hey. Did you hear that?

178
00:09:08,186 --> 00:09:09,286
No, what?

179
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:10,954
Caitlin just bit my head off.

180
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:13,290
She's been all business,
no emotion lately.

181
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,840
She's been... cold.

182
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:18,561
Cold? Come on, Cisco.

183
00:09:20,569 --> 00:09:22,904
This could be the beginning
of her becoming evil.

184
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,162
You're not worried about that?

185
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,463
I'm not worried about that.

186
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,732
Caitlin's not gonna become Killer Frost.

187
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,968
Hm. You haven't mentioned anything

188
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,403
about about Earth-2, have you?

189
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,605
No, 'cause I know how to keep a secret.

190
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,007
All right, well, look, I
mean, it's gonna take some time

191
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,175
for her to heal.

192
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:39,944
We just got to be there
for her, keep her busy.

193
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,313
That shouldn't be a problem.

194
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,814
Oh. Hey, Dig, Lyla.

195
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,082
What are you guys doing here?

196
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,252
We came to give you the head's up, Barry.

197
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,353
About what?

198
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,788
A meta-human who escaped
from A.R.G.U.S. custody,

199
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:52,423
goes by the name King Shark.

200
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,525
King Shark?

201
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,394
You mean the half-man/half-shark
that tried to kill you

202
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,195
months ago. I thought he was dead.

203
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,664
That's what A.R.G.U.S.
wanted you to believe

204
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,499
when they snatched him up, but believe me,

205
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,334
this half-shark is very much alive,

206
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:06,404
and his biological imperative
is telling him to do one thing.

207
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,838
That's kill you, Barry.

208
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,940
[scoffs]

209
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:12,243
We're gonna need a bigger Flash.

210
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,446
[sighs]

211
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,843
So how do you know about King Shark?

212
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,803
Well, as the new Director of A.R.G.U.S.,

213
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:27,539
Lyla's job is to clean
up Amanda Waller's messes.

214
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,608
King Shark was one of the
bigger and weirder ones.

215
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:31,210
And it appears under her directives,

216
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:33,212
A.R.G.U.S. had been
monitoring meta-human activity

217
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:34,446
for the past two years.

218
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:34,873
Why?

219
00:10:34,874 --> 00:10:37,956
Well, to see if any of those
powers could be exploited.

220
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:39,156
Weaponized.

221
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:43,160
How do you know that he's coming after me?

222
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,863
While in our custody, he
kept saying the same thing.

223
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:47,897
"Zoom wants The Flash dead"

224
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:50,801
And although he removed
the tracker we had in him,

225
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:52,436
the readings we did
receive show he that was

226
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:53,537
headed towards Central City.

227
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:54,638
Let him come.

228
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,174
Barry, this thing is a killing machine.

229
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:58,442
We just came here to warn you, man.

230
00:10:58,443 --> 00:10:59,543
Let A.R.G.U.S. handle it.

231
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:01,245
Nah, I can't do that, Dig.

232
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:03,581
I'm sorry, but all year,
we've been sitting ducks

233
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:05,749
for Zoom and his Earth-2 henchmen.

234
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,250
This is the last one.

235
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:09,386
I'm not gonna just wait for him to attack.

236
00:11:09,387 --> 00:11:12,554
I'm going after him
first. I owe that to Jay.

237
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:15,559
Wells, he's from your Earth.
What do you know about him?

238
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,394
Real name, Shay Lamden, he was a...

239
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:20,698
get this... marine biologist
before my particle accelerator

240
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:23,868
changed him into King Shark, and
Zoom put him under his control.

241
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:26,237
So how did you track him
when he attacked Barry?

242
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:28,672
Zoom sent him to this Earth to kill Barry.

243
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:29,840
I just followed.

244
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:32,276
Yeah, but you did track Grodd down.

245
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:33,777
Can you find King Shark too?

246
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:34,878
I can try.

247
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,280
All right.

248
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:41,949
Okay, well, all these locations
are next to a body of water.

249
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,721
There must only be a few
hours before he needs to get

250
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:46,123
back into the water to
re-oxygenate his blood.

251
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:47,158
[beeps]

252
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,559
I can take the waterfront.

253
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,860
Can you have your team handle the rest?

254
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:52,361
- I'll get them on it.
- All right.

255
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:54,732
What about Dr. Lamden's doppelganger?

256
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:56,433
Maybe he could help us somehow.

257
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:58,401
Or not. Looks like he died

258
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,938
when the particle accelerator exploded.

259
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,706
What about next of kin?

260
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:04,775
He's got a widow, Doctor Tanya Lamden.

261
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:07,011
She's a research
scientist at Nautilus Labs,

262
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:09,912
and she studies... wait for it... sharks.

263
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:12,917
Maybe the two of you can go
and see if she's discovered

264
00:12:12,918 --> 00:12:14,718
anything in her research
that could help us.

265
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,819
Sure.

266
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:17,154
Great.

267
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:20,991
- Hey, Digg.
- Yeah?

268
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:22,124
How's that helmet treating you?

269
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:23,794
Could use some improvements.

270
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:25,495
I'll get to work on it.

271
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,630
Hey, Joe, what's up?

272
00:12:26,631 --> 00:12:28,130
Hey, Bar, I talked to Wally,

273
00:12:28,131 --> 00:12:29,365
he wants to meet up with you.

274
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:30,467
All right.

275
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:32,200
He's working on his engineering project

276
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:32,974
at our place tonight.

277
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:35,438
He would love some help
from that big brain of yours.

278
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,696
Okay, Joe, look, I'm sorry,

279
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:38,130
right now is kind of a crazy time.

280
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,666
What? What's going on?

281
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:41,400
Remember that meta-human shark

282
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:43,569
that Patty was after and attacked me?

283
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:45,839
He's back? I thought Wells... you know.

284
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,074
Yeah, me too, but
apparently, A.R.G.U.S. had him

285
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:51,244
and he escaped, and now he's
heading for Central City.

286
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:52,346
I get it.

287
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:54,712
I'll tell Wally some other time.

288
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:56,582
Hey, you know what?

289
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,484
It's all good, I'll make it work.

290
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:00,718
Tell him tonight should be fine.

291
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:02,055
Are you sure?

292
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:03,823
- Yeah. <i>
- Thanks, Bar.</i>

293
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:05,025
Yeah, bye.

294
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:09,762
[sighs] Why?

295
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,502
It's been two years since your
particle accelerator exploded.

296
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:18,571
Seems a little late to be asking questions

297
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:20,406
about my husband, doesn't it?

298
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:23,644
Your husband passed away
from cancer, correct?

299
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:25,745
I suppose you could say that.

300
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:27,880
It only took three days
for every cell in his body

301
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:29,514
to grow uncontrollably.

302
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:33,276
Whatever cancer he had, it
turned him into something...

303
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,954
not human.

304
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,857
Well, that's why we're here, actually.

305
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,557
There's a meta-human in Central City

306
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:40,059
whose body seems to be mutating

307
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,561
in the same way as your late husband,

308
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:45,765
but he didn't die, he
became a dangerous monster.

309
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:47,634
My husband was no monster.

310
00:13:47,635 --> 00:13:50,037
That's not what she was implying.

311
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,938
What does this have to do with me?

312
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:54,074
We've read about the research
you're doing here on sharks.

313
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:56,242
Mm-hmm, yeah, I've had
some encouraging results,

314
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:58,143
although still preliminary.

315
00:13:58,446 --> 00:13:59,746
We need to see it.

316
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:01,180
I beg your pardon?

317
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:03,050
Your research, all of it.

318
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,884
What my colleague means to say is that

319
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,587
if you could please let us
take a look at your findings,

320
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:12,622
it could help us stop this
meta-human from hurting anyone.

321
00:14:12,794 --> 00:14:17,094
You're with S.T.A.R. Labs.
I'm just supposed to trust you?

322
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:19,266
Please, Mrs. Lamden.

323
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,700

Thank you.

- Little harsh.
- I was being direct.

00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:37,250
Yeah, well, that's one way to describe it.

328
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,652
You've been acting differently toward me

329

ever since you got back from Earth-2.

330

What's your problem, Cisco?

Nothing.

Hey, how's Felicity doing?

Well, I'm not gonna lie,
Barry, it was pretty rough

346
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:26,930
there at first, but you
know Felicity, she's tough.

00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:30,504
Yeah, she's just not
returning any of my calls.

348
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:32,938
She has a lot going on right now.

349
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,874
Buddy, I'll ask if she can give you a call

350
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,442
when this is all over.

351
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:39,079
Just want to catch this thing, man,

352
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,414
have everything to do with
Zoom and Earth-2 put behind us,

it's gonna slow you down.

So much for cleaning up

00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:17,589
We don't find King Shark soon,

00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,958
someone's gonna be cleaning up after mine.

We'll find him, Lyla.

366
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:24,897
All right, I searched the whole area.

367
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:25,998
He's gone.

368
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:27,299
Couldn't have gotten far.

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,001
Still, he knows we're here now.

00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:31,235
We lost the element of surprise.

371
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,295
Not if Wells can figure
out a way to track him.

372
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:35,789
In the meantime, we'll keep looking.

up with you guys later.

I got to go see Joe's son.

00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:43,864
Okay, I thought our
relationship was hard to follow.

376
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:44,965
See ya.

377
00:16:47,535 --> 00:16:50,270
[chuckles] He's fast, John, get over it.

378
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:51,371
Never.

Joe thought I should have you take a look.

380
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:07,020
So, this is what I got so
far for my project essay

381
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:09,654
to get into CCU's engineering program.

382
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:14,560
Turbine supercars?

383
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:17,164
Turbines? Like jet engines?

384
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:19,399
Yeah, yeah, it'd use an
engine like the ones they have

385
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,767
in some helicopters, only
it'd run on bio-diesel.

386
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:25,051
- Cool.
- It's very cool.

387
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,673
Yeah, you're gonna want to address

388
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:28,308
the fuel economy issue here.

389
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:31,611
It is a jet, so it's gonna
burn through a lot of fuel.

390
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:33,547
Yeah, that's why I want to use bio-diesel.

391
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:35,815
It'll run off of anything
that burns with oxygen.

392
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:37,551
No, okay, but you also got a sound issue.

393
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:38,852
Gonna wake the neighbors...

394
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:40,153

all together, work it out?

00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,750

407
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:12,118

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,150
another set of eyes, considering.

417
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:47,320

this icy look in your eye

She's a coldhearted ice

00:19:36,935 --> 00:19:39,570
Now Harry's gonna kill me and
throw myself across the room.

439
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:43,016
Cisco, I'm not a meta-human.

440
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:45,309
Okay, I hear you, but you're acting

441
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,977
just like she did over there.

442
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:50,145

You're being detached.

You're being cold.

444
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,283
Because I have to be right now.

445
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:58,385
I just watched Jay get killed
right in front of my eyes,

446
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:02,025
just when I was starting
to feel normal again,

447
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:04,393
just when I was beginning to love.

448
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:08,798
So if I let myself feel,

449
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:13,006
if I let all of that pain and anger out,

450
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:14,671
it's never gonna stop,

451
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,407
and that's not gonna help me either,

452
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:19,509
so let's just get back to this research

453
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,143
and figure out how to find King Shark.

454
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:23,647
Okay.

455
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:36,827
Here you are.

456
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,197
Yup, just like back home, always working.

457
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,366
I'm trying to locate this King Shark.

458
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,267
He's here? On this Earth?

459
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:46,436
Yes, it turns out our friend Zoom

460
00:20:46,437 --> 00:20:48,870
brought him here to kill The Flash.

461
00:20:49,574 --> 00:20:52,109
Looks like he's stuck
here just like we are.

462
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,911
It looks like he is, and
so I need to figure this out

463
00:20:54,912 --> 00:20:57,486
before more people get hurt, Jessie, so...

464
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,317
Probability distribution algorithm?

465
00:21:00,318 --> 00:21:01,952
Partial matching strategies, yes.

466
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:02,799
Based on what?

467
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:06,151
Semantic trajectories...
water, Central City, The Flash.

468
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:08,769
What about mobility behaviors?

469
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,539
Jessie.

470
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:12,508
Look, you wanted me out of that room,

471
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:15,378
but now that I am, you don't want me here.

472
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:18,348
Just let me help, please.

473
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,917
Grab a marker.

474
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:27,293
[sighs]

475
00:21:27,824 --> 00:21:28,924
Yeah.

476
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,747
Hardest part was amping the torque

477
00:21:32,748 --> 00:21:34,081
without increasing drag.

478
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:35,616
A heavier engine would
only slow things down,

479
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:37,418
but this streamlined
version should optimize

480
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:39,852
both the torque and the horsepower.

481
00:21:39,855 --> 00:21:43,424
Yeah, I'm just worried
it's... won't be enough still.

482
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:44,725
Here, let's do this...

483
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:46,060
use a one-to-one transfer gearbox

484
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:48,362
to drop the output shaft of the engine,

485
00:21:48,363 --> 00:21:50,465

Sharks are predators.

627
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:02,972
In order to track their prey, they use

628
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:05,007
what's known as passive electrolocation.

629
00:29:05,008 --> 00:29:06,709
Passive electrolocation?

630
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,711

active electrolocation.

We reprogram our satellite to generate

639

just like you are.

814
00:38:26,028 --> 00:38:28,230
What are you doing with those?

815
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:29,865
I'm adjusting the wavelength trigger,

816
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:31,900
see if I can get these to work over here.

817
00:38:31,901 --> 00:38:34,002
So you can catch some breachers?

818
00:38:34,003 --> 00:38:35,570
[inhales sharply] Dear God!

819
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:37,871
Caitlin, your hands are freezing.

820
00:38:37,874 --> 00:38:40,574
Caitlin. I've always hated that name.

821
00:38:41,878 --> 00:38:42,978
Oh, no.

822
00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:46,748
No, no, no, it's starting.
You're starting to become...

823
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:47,849
Killer Frost?

824
00:38:50,553 --> 00:38:51,653
[laughs]

825
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,422
That ain't right.

826
00:38:54,423 --> 00:38:55,891
That ain't right, that's just rude.

827
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:57,158
Who put you up to this?

828
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,393
Barry put you up to this, didn't he?

829
00:38:58,394 --> 00:39:00,829
Oh, I should've know you two were...

830
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:01,997
- Cold?
- Yeah.

831
00:39:02,698 --> 00:39:04,065
You deserve it for thinking

832
00:39:04,066 --> 00:39:06,433
that I could ever become like her.

833
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,771
Cisco, you need to stop worrying about me.

834
00:39:09,772 --> 00:39:12,774
I may be sad, I may want to
be alone for a little while,

835
00:39:12,775 --> 00:39:16,142
but I promise you, Killer
Frost will never exist

836
00:39:16,412 --> 00:39:17,845
on this earth, okay?

837
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:19,247
Besides, you tested me.

838
00:39:19,248 --> 00:39:21,881
I don't even have the meta-human gene,

839
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:24,584
so please stop worrying about me, okay?

840
00:39:26,222 --> 00:39:27,188
Okay.

841
00:39:27,189 --> 00:39:28,289
[both chuckle]

842
00:39:28,457 --> 00:39:30,890
Come on, Barry wants us upstairs.

843
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,496
For real, though, you got
to work on that circulation.

844
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,231
You might have Raynaud's or something.

845
00:39:36,232 --> 00:39:39,865
- You know what Raynaud's is?
- I'm a doctor, Cisco.

846
00:39:40,436 --> 00:39:43,875
Hail, hail, the gang's
all here. What's good?

847
00:39:43,954 --> 00:39:45,054
[sighs] Uh...

848
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,751
I need to apologize to you all.

849
00:39:52,144 --> 00:39:53,244
Um...

850
00:39:54,046 --> 00:39:56,652
Last year I made a choice

851
00:39:56,653 --> 00:40:00,421
to go back in time and save my mother,

852
00:40:02,398 --> 00:40:06,238
and that choice had a lot of consequences

853
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:08,317
that will haunt me for
the rest of my life,

854
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,290
just like I know it haunts all of you too.

855
00:40:15,173 --> 00:40:19,338
Zoom, Jay's death...

856
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,513
It's all because of me,

857
00:40:24,282 --> 00:40:27,367
but I own those choices.

858
00:40:27,786 --> 00:40:30,154
We're the ones who opened
the door to Earth-2.

859
00:40:30,155 --> 00:40:32,423
We're the ones who brought Zoom here,

860
00:40:32,424 --> 00:40:35,791
but we are also the ones
who are gonna stop him.

861
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:37,495
How?

862
00:40:39,297 --> 00:40:41,664
How are we gonna stop Zoom, Allen?

863
00:40:42,801 --> 00:40:44,168
I don't know yet.

864
00:40:48,006 --> 00:40:50,775
But those breaches aren't closed forever,

865
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:53,009
and we're not done with Earth-2.

866
00:41:01,219 --> 00:41:03,186
Jay's death was not in vain.

867
00:41:05,323 --> 00:41:07,445
We will meet Zoom again,

868
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:11,240
and the next time, I will beat him,

869
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:14,764
whoever that monster is.

870
