Yeah.

151
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:30,193
Where's Danny Zorn?
He ought to head over there
and debrief her.

152
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:32,196
Why did Bourne come here?

153
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:35,495
We don't know yet.
Landy's upstairs
in one of the rooms.

154
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:38,035
She said she'd call you
when she's done.

Okay.

156

I think I'll, uh... take a cab
back to the hotel.

157
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,513
So, the room he checked into
was across the hall.

Mmm.

159

I recognize this room
from a photo.

161
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:17,473
There was a chalk outline right here
around the body of Vladimir Neski.

162
00:18:18,643 --> 00:18:21,737
This is where
his wife killed him?

Do you still think
his wife killed him?

Guess he got out
through this window.

165

We just got word
from the Berlin police.
