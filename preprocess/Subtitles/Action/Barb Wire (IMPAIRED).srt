00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,280 
Now, where the hell is William Krebs?.

314
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,560 
Never heard of him.

315
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,120 
Why are your men watching him?.

316
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,920 
That"s classified police business.

317
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,480 
I can tell you he was resistance

318
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,040 
and there"s
a million-dollar bounty on his head.

319
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,880 
So if someone knew where Krebs was,
I could make it worth their while.

320
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,600 
Goodbye, Willis.

321
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,080 
OK.

322
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,200 
By the way, Barb, we"re expecting
some distinguished visitors tomorrow.

323
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,760 
A Congressional delegation
out of Washington,

324
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,120 
including First Directorate
Colonel Victor Pryzer.

325
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,400 
- I might bring "em by the Hammerhead.
- Their money"s welcome.

326
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,480 
You don"t know Victor Pryzer.

327
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,920 
Speaking of money,

328
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,000 
I don"t have to make any more arrests
tonight for, say, the usual 3,000.

329
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,520 
- 1,500.
- 1,500?.

330
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,720 
I better go down
and start checking some more lDs.

331
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,280 
- 2,500.
- Two grand.

332
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,400 
- Darling.
- Thirty bucks for the cognac.

333
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,640 
Add it to my tab, Miss Kopetski.
Boom, boom, boom.

334
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,600 
Miss Kopetski died in the war.

335
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,600 
I"m Barb Wire.

336
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,960 
Cigarettes and a drink
and l"ll be fine.

337
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,480 
Give me a goddamn drink. You,
you or you, just give me my drink.

338
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,720 
- Sir, we"re not open yet.
- I think you"ve had enough already.

339
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,360 
Ah, blow me.

340
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,160 
Camille, package check.

341
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,480 
[he whimpers]

342
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,200 
Get her off! Get her off of me!

343
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,920 
That"s Camille. She works here.

344
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,760 
Camille, sit.

345
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,000 
[he groans]

346
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,360 
- You want to see her roll over?.
- No, no, no.

347
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,720 
Good. Camille, outside.

348
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,720 
[growls]

349
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,000 
- Have a nice day.
- Yes, ma"am.

350
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,880 
Joe, see if you can get some food
down Charlie"s neck.

351
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,120 
Willis, what"s with the monkey suit?.

352
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,200 
You know how uniforms
impress the Congressionals.

353
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,160 
The Delegation arrived this morning.
They could be here any minute.

354
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,640 
- Excuse me, Barb.
- My table?.

355
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,600 
Best in the house, as requested.

356
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,400 
Just keep them away
from the weapons check.

357
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,960 
We don"t want any customers from
the United Front trying to get even.

358
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,360 
You"ll find our guests from Washington
command more respect than that.

359
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,640 
You"re confusing respect with fear.

360
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,760 
[loud clang]

361
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,520 
[guns being cocked]

362
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,840 
Speak of the devil.

363
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,800 
They are punctual, l"ll give "em that.

364
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,520 
You"ll join us for a drink later?.
On my tab, of course.

365
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,160 
Fat chance.

366
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,800 
Colonel Pryzer, Alexander Willis,
Director of Police Operations.

367
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,480 
- Welcome to Steel Harbor.
- Wipe that smile off your face.

368
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,920 
This burnt-out hell-hole is the last
place on earth I want to be.

369
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,200 
If it wasn"t for
your almost complete incompetence,

370
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,680 
I wouldn"t be here
in the first place, would l?.

371
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,400 
Yes, well, needless to say,

372
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,720 
we had intended to have both Krebs
and Cora D sent to Washington by now.

373
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,400 
Due to circumstances
outside our control...

374
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,800 
Listen, carefully.

375
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,680 
If Cora D escapes...

376
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,760 
...I will personally
rip your heart out of your ass

377
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,640 
and stuff it back down your throat.

378
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,920 
That"s not very sanitary.

379
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,760 
[DJ] You say it"s late, and l"m here
to tell you, it only feels that way.

380
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,440 
So sit back and enjoy someone or
something illicit if you can get it,

381
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,120 
and listen to the music.

382
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,920 
Gentlemen, the steaks
are excellent tonight.

383
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,240 
Ah, Colonel Pryzer,

384
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,320 
allow me to introduce
our hostess, the inimitable...

385
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,560 
Even in Washington,
we"ve heard of Barb Wire.

386
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,280 
I hope you"ll join us.

387
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,920 
Mm.

388
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,240 
- You attract a very eclectic crowd.
- It looks that way.

389
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,800 
Rumour is you used to fight
with the resistance.

390
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,240 
You shouldn"t believe
everything you hear. I"m neutral.

391
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,440 
- l"m a businesswoman, Colonel.
- Perhaps we can do business.

392
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,800 
I can assure you,
Barb has a very keen sense of commerce.

393
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,760 
Then l"ll get to the point. There"s
a fugitive, a traitor in Steel Harbor.

394
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,680 
She intends to cross into Canada,

395
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,080 
with the help of some of
the more disenchanted citizenry.

396
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,680 
Do I look disenchanted?.

397
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,160 
I"m sure your business brings you
into contact with all levels of society.

398
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,360 
I thought you were
getting to the point.

399
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,120 
Her name is Dr Corrina Devonshire,
but you may have heard of her as Cora D.

400
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,840 
One of those overly romanticised
resistance names.

401
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,920 
Keeps her legend alive.

402
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,720 
- What does she look like?.
- We"re not sure.

403
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,400 
She had her appearance
surgically altered.

404
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,280 
These are photos of her before.

405
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,400 
It"s hard to find somebody unless
you know what she looks like.

406
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,440 
Her appearance is of no consequence.

407
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,160 
Identification can always be
made by retinal scanning.

408
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,240 
So... the Congressionals
can count on your assistance?.

409
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,320 
Excuse me, boss. Trouble in the kitchen.

410
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,160 
I need you.

411
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,240 
Excuse me, gentlemen.

412
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,720 
I have a bar to run.

413
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,200 
- Very interesting woman.
- With most impressive assets.

414
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,680 
Gentlemen. Here you are, sir.

415
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,960 
Act natural?.
That"s easier said than done.

416
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,400 
Two beers, buddy. I was looking for
Barb or Charlie Kopetski.

417
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,680 
Charlie"s down there.

418
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,040 
The Congressionals.

419
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,400 
- They have my photographs.
- Let"s hope resistance are here.

420
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,320 
- They"ll be looking everywhere for you.
- Well, who are we meeting?.

421
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,200 
Someone I used to know.

422
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,960 
Wait here.

423
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,640 
Hello, Charlie.

424
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,080 
This must be
a post-traumatic stress flashback.

425
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,280 
I could swear I just heard
an old voice from the battlefield.

426
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,960 
Surprised to see me?.

427
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,680 
Do I look surprised?.

428
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,400 
Guess you didn"t hear.

429
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,760 
A Congressional smart grenade. It
followed me all the way to my foxhole.

430
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,720 
I thought l"d dug it deep enough.
I guess I didn"t.

431
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,600 
- l"m sorry.
- Yeah. Me too.

432
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,760 
Miss, two bourbons.

433
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,320 
[laughs] You don"t have to
buy me a drink, Axel.

434
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,400 
I"m tight with the management here.

435
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,440 
You got a lot of nerve coming in here.

436
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,000 
I had no choice. Where"s Barb?.

437
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,480 
I don"t think talking to Barb"s
a good idea.

438
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,760 
She took Seattle
a lot harder than I did.

439
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,680 
I need her help, Charlie. I need her to
put us in touch with local resistance.

440
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,720 
Haven"t you heard?.

441
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,360 
Barb"s retired.

442
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,840 
Leave, now, before Barb sees you.

443
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,680 
- There"s no telling what she"ll do.
- There he is.

444
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,960 
Too late.

445
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,880 
Three...

446
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,200 
- Two...
- Hello, Barb.

447
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,360 
One.

448
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,240 
- You all right?.
- I guess I deserved that.

449
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,120 
Get out.

450
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,840 
- I need your help.
- Rot in hell.

451
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,840 
I will. I remember
when you believed in something.

452
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,200 
I remember how it felt.
Like I was kicked in the stomach.

453
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,160 
I"m looking for a man named Krebs.
I"ve got 24 hours.

454
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,000 
I don"t even know how I feel.
I don"t feel much anymore.

455
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,200 
- Just trust me, please.
- Trust you. Like I did in Seattle?.

456
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,320 
It was not what you think.
I never wanted to hurt you.

457
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,000 
- Now"s not the time to explain.
- You"re three years late, Axel.

458
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,280 
- Get out and don"t come back.
- Your check, sir.

459
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,040 
Such blatant disregard for money.

460
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,960 
Thank you for you hospitality.
I do hope you"ll think about our offer.

461
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,640 
I"m thinking about it.

462
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,080 
- I knew it. I shouldn"t have come here.
- That woman"s in love with you.

463
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,160 
There are a lot of things
I need to tell you.

464
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,720 
- Well, I hope...
- [Charlie] Axel, over here.

465
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,800 
Charlie?.

466
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,160 
I can help.

467
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,120 
The blind leading the blind.

468
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,520 
Go to the old factory district. There's
a place called Steel Harbor Metalworks.

469
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,560 
It's a front for the resistance.

470
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,600 
There's a stairway in the back
near the loading dock.

471
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,160 
Watch yourself.

472
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,200 
[guns being cocked]

473
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,760 
[Cora] Shit.

474
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,720 
[through voicebox] Who are you?

475
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,400 
Charlie Kopetski sent us. It doesn"t
matter who I am, but this is Cora D.

476
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,200 
Scan 'em.

477
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,960 
[computer] Retinal scan verified.
Dr Corrina Devonshire. 44791.

478
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,720 
Cora D, I admire you.
We've been looking for you.

479
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,480 
I never thought
I'd meet the legend in person.

480
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,840 
I'm commander here. They call me Spike.

481
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,440 
- You"re so young.
- Maybe, but l"m tough.

482
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:35,280 
We"re glad we found you.
We hope that you can help us, Spike.

483
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,800 
It took us a while, but we found Krebs.

484
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,560 
The lenses are gone,
not to mention his eyeballs.

485
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,000 
He was in an abandoned
washing machine at the old VA hospital.

486
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,080 
The Congressionals took the lenses?.

487
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,640 
No, the Congressionals are
still looking for Krebs. We know that.

488
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,840 
The local cops don't know squat either.
Everybody's chasing their tail.

489
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,440 
So who"s got the contact lenses now?.

490
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,720 
Krebs was turned over
to a bail bondsman named SchmitZ.

491
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,760 
SchmitZ was aiming to turn him over to
the Congressionals for the bounty.

492
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,760 
- Then he got wise to the lenses.
- Worth two million on the black market.

493
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,560 
Without them, there"s no way l"ll get
past the retinal scan and on that plane.

494
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,280 
Now, let"s get Schmitz.

495
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,440 
It's not that easy.
We can't find him anywhere.

496
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,040 
- That plane leaves in 24 hours.
- There must be someone that can help.

497
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,640 
One person in Steel Harbor
has connections on all sides.

498
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,920 
If anyone knows where SchmitZ is,
she does.

499
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,880 
Trouble is, she won't help nobody
for free and we're a little low on cash.

500
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,960 
You know I do.
Honey, don"t make me say it, OK?.

501
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,640 
I love you. Bye.

502
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,000 
- [laughter]
- What are you two laughing at?.

503
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,080 
- Who was that?.
- Your mother.

504
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,120 
- Three.
- How many?.

505
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,080 
Put that down!

506
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,600 
- How many?.
- Give me two.

507
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,240 
- Your bet, Moe.
- l"ll bet, when I get ready. Just wait.

508
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760 
What"s going on?.

509
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,360 
Attention!

510
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,000 
I don"t know how you do things
in Washington,

511
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,480 
but I do make the occasional arrest
without slaughter.

512
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,640 
You incompetent.
We needed to make an interrogation.

513
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,200 
Sorry, sir. They resisted.

514
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,240 
Any of these men Schmitz?.

515
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,440 
Nope.

516
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,040 
Look who"s here.

517
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,400 
Krebs. Cora D can"t be far.

518
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,520 
I"ll need one of the bodies.

519
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,680 
Preferably one without a head wound.

520
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,880 
[stick tapping on floor]

521
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,160 
Hey, hey, you want some company?.

522
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,640 
No.

523
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,440 
OK. Do you want some advice?.

524
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,480 
No.

525
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,600 
OK.

526
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,760 
Drink when you want to remember, Barb,
not when you want to forget.

527
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,840 
[pouring amplified]

528
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,400 
[Axel in her head]
I'll be there. I promise.

529
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,880 
[siren, gunfire]

530
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,920 
- [whistling shell]
- Let"s go!

531
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,400 
- We have to go now!
- No. He"ll be here.

532
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,400 
- Barb!
- Axel!

533
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,800 
- Are you Barbara Kopetski?.
- Yes. Where"s Axel?.

534
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,440 
He"s not coming.

535
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,160 
He said he"s sorry,
but you got to get out of here.

536
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,560 
You guys got to
get out of here, go, go, go!

537
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,320 
That"s it. Come on, let"s go.

538
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,480 
Come on, get in, get in.

539
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,400 
You cheated me
out of a million bucks, Schmitz.

540
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,920 
I should blow your head off right now.

541
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,000 
Lucky for me, you don"t hold a grudge.

542
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,360 
Don"t l?.

543
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,280 
A million dollars is pocket change
to what"s going down.

544
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,480 
I got a business proposition. You got
connections, everyone knows that.

545
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,280 
I don"t take sides.

546
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,120 
Exactly. You deal with everybody.

547
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,720 
I got something to deal.

548
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,680 
- You can"t sell Krebs on your own?.
- lt"s not about Krebs anymore.

549
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,200 
It"s about retinal contact lenses.

550
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,000 
They"re smuggled in from Germany.
Put these in your eyes,

551
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,200 
you get through any retinal scanner,
Congressional or UN.

552
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,560 
I was gonna sell "em,
but it fell through.

553
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,000 
Krebs was resistance.
Those belong to his friends.

554
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,080 
Do yourself a favour.
Give "em back and say you"re sorry.

555
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,320 
Goddamn it, Barb, I can"t.
They"ll kill me and you know it.

556
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,800 
The Congressionals broke into my office.
They slaughtered everybody.

557
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,520 
They were looking for me.

558
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,120 
With or without these, l"m a dead man.

559
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,880 
Relax, Schmitz, you can only die once.

560
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,760 
Barb...

561
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,600 
I know I double-crossed you.

562
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,240 
I made a mistake. It happens.

563
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,760 
I want to trade the lenses.

564
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,120 
- I want to trade them to you.
- For what?.

565
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:03,680 
Get me out of Steel Harbor. Canada,
maybe. Get me out and they"re yours.

566
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,560 
You want out?. Click your heels
together three times.

567
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,640 
You could sell these.
You know how much they"re worth?.

568
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,360 
You could get two mill Canadian, easy.

569
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,800 
That"s enough money to get to Europe.

570
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,120 
You could get a neuro-electrical
operation for Charlie.

571
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:26,160 
I don"t buy. I don"t sell. Get out.

572
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,040 
You"re gonna regret not dealing with me.

573
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,120 
You"re gonna regret this
very, very much.

574
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,640 
I"ll add that to my list.

575
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,200 
The subject is reasonably fresh,

576
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,040 
but we"ll only get a few seconds
of readable data.

577
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,840 
Cognitive impressions,
closest to death first,

578
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,880 
and then what"s left, memories, dreams.

579
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,760 
- Record it.
- Yes, sir. Step away from the tank.

580
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,480 
- That"s it?.
- Here it is in slow-motion, Colonel.

581
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,680 
Issue a warrant
for the arrest of Barb Wire.

582
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,840 
Issue a warrant?. This isn"t Washington.
I need a reason.

583
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,800 
She"s involved.

584
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,600 
You heard what he said.
Sometimes all you get are dreams.

585
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,120 
Every man in Steel Harbor
dreams about Barb Wire.

586
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:17,360 
- I need something more conclusive...
- When did the law ever matter to you?.

587
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,280 
Miss Wire may know
the whereabouts of the lenses.

588
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,760 
- We"ll search her bar.
- Retinal lenses?.

589
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,880 
This is over a set of Bausch and Lombs?.

590
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,880 
It"s over capturing
an enemy of the Republic.

591
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,320 
a traitor named Cora D.

592
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:35,120 
If Cora D were to exit
this charming free city,

593
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,800 
your relationship with the Republic
would be severely compromised...

594
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,400 
...painfully compromised.

595
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,480 
- Do I make myself clear?.
- Mm-hm.

596
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,960 
Your administrative fee will cover
the cost of a search warrant.

597
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,360 
Now, find a reason
to search the Hammerhead.

598
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:01,040 
As you wish, Colonel, as you wish.

599
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,640 
I"m unarmed.

600
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,880 
How did you get in here?. Where"s my dog?.

601
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,320 
Hey, l"m irresistible to females.

602
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,680 
Thanks, Camille.

603
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,680 
Towel.

604
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,160 
- What?. Are you gonna shoot me?.
- Why waste a good bullet?.

605
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,880 
I told you never to come back.

606
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,560 
I came here to do a job.

607
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,920 
The biggest operation
I ever signed up for.

608
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,080 
And I came ready for anything
the Congressionals could lob at me.

609
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,560 
The only thing I wasn"t prepared for
was running into you.

610
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,640 
You"ll get over it. I did.

611
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,880 
- I wouldn"t have come unless I had to.
- I wouldn"t be here if l"d known.

612
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,080 
Goddamn it!

613
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,360 
I guess it"s bad timing for both of us.

614
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,680 
Am I interrupting something?.

615
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,880 
Lovely, you brought company.

616
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,400 
Barb, this is my wife, Cora D.

617
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:24,320 
How impressive. I"m sure
you"ll have very strong, smart children.

618
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,480 
Look, I know this is awkward
for all of us,

619
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,680 
and, Barb, all I ever wanted in Seattle
was to disappear with you.

620
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,760 
- The war changed that.
- [Cora] It changed everything.

621
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,920 
Good one.

622
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,800 
I"m not surprised
you don"t believe me.

623
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,480 
The mission took months.
I thought after so long,

624
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,440 
I was better left in your past.

625
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,240 
So that"s why
I didn"t get a wedding invitation?.

626
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,240 
There"s more to this story
than meets the eye.

627
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,560 
Remember what happened
in Topeka, Kansas?.

628
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,160 
How the whole city was wiped out?.
I can explain.

629
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,160 
I was chief of medical research
for the Congressionals.

630
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,360 
I was directly but unknowingly involved
in a globally catastrophic project,

631
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,720 
an HlV derivative known as Red Ribbon.

632
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,200 
It can kill you in 1 2 hours.

633
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,160 
When I learned Topeka, Kansas,
was a lab experiment,

634
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,680 
and they planned to unleash
Red Ribbon on the free territories,

635
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,440 
I defected to the resistance.

636
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,640 
Axel helped me
get out of Washington.

637
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,880 
Initially, we married purely
for identification purposes.

638
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,960 
- We"ve been on the run ever since.
- How utterly goddamn heroic.

639
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,920 
Now, what do you want with me?.

640
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,680 
Cora has the Red Ribbon vaccine in
her system. The Congressionals want it.

641
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:40,120 
We have to show the Truce Commission
there"s a cure to the epidemic.

642
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,880 
We have to tell the world. We need your
help. The cause needs your help.

643
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:51,160 
- What"s the cause done for me lately?.
- Barb, where are the contact lenses?.

644
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:55,240 
- If I knew, you think l"d tell you?.
- We know Schmitz was here last night.

645
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,520 
If you know where the lenses are,
for Christ"s sake just name a price.

646

That"s what you do, isn"t it?.
Sell yourself to the highest bidder?.

647
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,080 
I"m out of your price range.

- They"ll have every exit covered.

650
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,680 
Fall in, ladies!

651
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,800 
Give me three minutes
and meet me downstairs.

652
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,760

- Maybe you shouldn"t.

- lt"s legal. We have a warrant.

What exactly are you looking for?.

660
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:38,000 
- This is a murder investigation.
- lt"s a Congressional matter.

661
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:42,080 
I can assure you, citizen, that
if we discover that you"re involved,

662
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:47,080 
the consequences would be
abrupt and severe.

663
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,920 
- Who are they?.
- I picked them up on the boulevard.

664

What the hell were they looking for?.

679
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:11,840 
- Stupid contact lenses.
- Oh, yeah?.

680
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:15,200 
Schmitz was here trying
to trade them for a trip to Canada.

681
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,160 
- I should"ve done it.
- Contact lenses?.

Yeah.

- What colour are they?.
- The colour of money.

685
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,040 
Give them to Axel
and help them escape.

686

No. This is our ticket to Europe.

- Charlie, you worry too much.
- lt"s not just about money.

I knew Charlie was still friendly

to drop your weapons.

You"ll love this, Barb.
Not only do I get the lenses,

828

but I get a million dollars bounty on
you, and a million for the good doctor

for turning you in
to the Congressionals.
