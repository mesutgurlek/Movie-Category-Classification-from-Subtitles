You get nothing until I get some answers.

786
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,365
- He-Man, He-Man. Someone's following us.
- What the hell is that?

GWILDOR: At 10.

- Hey. Drop your weapons or I...
- He-Man.

791

Gwildor, how long to calculate
the coordinates and take us home?

792

I don't know.
The keys have all been moved.

793

- Boy, are you people in trouble.
- He-Man, 0.61 chromons until moonrise.

799
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,365
...the natives and the key
are within the structure, but...

800
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,827
- Yes, Karg?
- He-Man.

801

The Eternians have already arrived.

802

There.

808
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:15,115
There's Grayskull, and that puts us...

809

...there, but we have to be there.

810
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:21,997
Twenty metrons forward
if we wanna break through...

811
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:25,709
...the barrier of the Sorceress' force field.

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Now, what are you trying to do?

Hey, this is really weird, huh?

816

Reminds me of
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

817
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:42,476
The part where the pods
started taking over people's bodies.

818
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,978
You don't know who are pods
and who are the bodies.

819

Shut up. They're psychos, Corrigan.

820
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:51,693
We've stumbled onto some
loony fringe group here, some kind of cult.

821

Our guests are arriving.

- Gwildor, how much longer?
- I don't know. I don't know.

823
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,823
I'd give all the chalconite in Fribillian...

824
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,493
...if I could only spend two units
with a master song maker.

825
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,461
- You think they don't like us?
- No, they're just Ionely.

826
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:52,963
They miss us.

827

Go.

828
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,907
He-Man.

World War III?

832

Don't let him out of sight.
Guard the key with your life.

833

If anyone comes near it, blast him.

834

They're killing each other out there.

835

- Is Gwildor ready?
- Not yet. The room's secure.

a woman's touch.

All right, this is for real.
She meant what she said.

841

- I said give me the gun.
- No.

Look, we've come this far.
We're not giving up until they get home.

Look, don't stop, Gwildor, all right?

844

Don't say I didn't give you a chance.
When this is over, you're going to jail:

- You're all right.

1255
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,196
What's this all about?

1256
01:39:55,364 --> 01:39:57,949
I love you both so much.
I don't ever want to lose you.

1257
01:39:58,117 --> 01:40:00,743
We're just going away for the day.
We'll be back tonight.

1258
01:40:00,911 --> 01:40:02,453
No.

1259
01:40:02,621 --> 01:40:05,915
I changed my mind.
I do wanna go to the beach with you today.

1260
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:07,542
Don't go to Catalina, okay?

1261
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:12,255
- Don't be silly, honey. Stay home and study.
- Mom, Dad, please.

1262
01:40:12,464 --> 01:40:14,841
Don't get on that plane today.

1263
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:16,843
I have a terrible feeling.

1264
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:20,096
Julie, your father's an excellent pilot.
It's a short trip.

1265
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:21,723
No.

1266
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,311
- Julie. Julie, put those keys back.
- I love you.

1267
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:30,815
Julie, where are you going?
Come back here.

1268
01:40:33,736 --> 01:40:37,113
KEVIN: Julie.
- Kevin.

1269
01:40:40,951 --> 01:40:42,744
KEVIN:
Oh. Oh...

1270
01:40:42,911 --> 01:40:46,914
- Don't let your parents get on that plane.
- I've already stopped them.

1271
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:49,459
Wait a minute.

1272
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:51,794
You know?

1273
01:40:52,254 --> 01:40:53,713
Yeah.

1274
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:56,299
We were there.

1275
01:41:01,513 --> 01:41:03,181
Eternia.

1276
01:41:13,859 --> 01:41:17,904
I have the power!

1277
01:45:22,733 --> 01:45:24,900
I'll be back.

1278
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:31,991
