Oh, my God.

171
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,243
Oh, my God.
That guy's cut in half.

172
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,925
What the fuck!
Don't look! Don't look at it.

173
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,043
Don't look! Look at me. Look at me!
We went down.

174
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,122
My hand's fucked,
my leg's fucked.

175
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,850
Ah! Fuck!

176
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,809
It's good.
It's good that it hurts.

177
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,006
Is it good?
It's good, yeah.

Yeah. Are you
bleeding anywhere else?

I don't know, man.
I can't tell.

181
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,849
Let me get you some cover.
Don't go. Don't leave me.

182
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,246
No, no! I'll be straight back.
Where are you going?

183
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,691
It's okay.
I'll be straight back.

I gotta
get out of here.

188
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,090
It's gonna be okay.

189
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,525

I just gotta make a call to Vanessa.
I gotta make a quick call.

193
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,442
Quick, to Vanessa.
Just one call.

You're in shock,

00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,564
But I need you to
stand up and help me.

196
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,687
What happened?

197
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,330
The plane went down, man.

198
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,401
What?
We crashed.

199
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,403
No, no, no way.
That's bullshit.

200

That's fucking bullshit.
I'm just asleep.

201
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,647
We crashed.
I was just sleeping.

202
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,529
Like, there's no way
that could've happened.

203
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,801
What about the pilots?

204
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,530
The pilots?
What are you talking about?

205
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,490
The plane's gone, man.
It's in pieces.

206
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,800
Look.

207
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,766
Fuck.

I can't fucking
believe

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,731
Is there a bunch
of people dead?

Yes.

213

Now I need you to help me
find the ones that aren't.

Yeah.

the whammy on us.

fucking crash us? Huh?

I didn't do shit.

We should gather up
anything that'll burn,

any wood we can find.

So we don't die.

We build up a fire,
then we find food.

out what way is south,

somebody'll be fucking searching.

They gotta know that plane
went off the radar.

311
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,764
Right. If they send 50 planes,
maybe they'll find us.

312
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,683
But they won't send 50 planes
because it won't matter.

313
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,410
Because we won't
have time to wait

for the one or two
that they will send.

If we're close to their den, and

then they'll come after us.

of anything then.

that I would punch out

and that would be my
fucking swan song, right?

is worth the fight.

him off, you know.
