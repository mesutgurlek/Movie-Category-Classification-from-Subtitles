00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,443
and it mustn't fall into the
hands of the wrong person.

332
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:49,844
And Snow White thinks
I'm the one to find it?

333
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:52,513
She commands
you to find it.

334
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,015
And to deliver it
to Sanctuary,

335
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:56,601
where its wickedness
can forever be contained.

336

00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:03,066
Yes, yes, yes.
He accepts.

a reward.

The Mirror...

343
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,124
She said she couldn't
stop looking at it.

344
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:23,169
She could hear
its voice calling for her.

345
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:25,630
That's why
she sent it away.

346

What was that thing?

Move all your forces
to the northern border.

Freya,
Queen of the North.

350
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:01,207
That owl was her spy.

351
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:02,959
Now she knows
about the Mirror.

352
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:06,421
And if she finds it, everything we
hold dear will be covered in ice.

353
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:07,544
Move your men
to the north.

No, you're not.

If she's in trouble, I wanna help!

Vardhelm has fallen.

Is this where the world ends,
or is there more?

My queen, the South
cannot be conquered.

Snow White's lands are too vast,
her armies are too...

Did you know
that Eric was alive?

370
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,207
Did you?

371
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:27,210
How?

00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:28,294
I swear to you.

There's something
that he seeks.

It holds great power.

379
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,895
And with it at my command,
I can do great things.

380
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:49,524
I will free every child.

00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,526
I will save them all.

As I saved you.

of Huntsmen will grow

stand in its path.

How much further?

that I don't know where it is?

Well, obviously.

397

This takes us to
the northern road.

398

Leads direct
to Sanctuary.

399

Don't need to be
a Huntsman to know that.

Ooh.

I'm talking to the dirt.
I hear it speak to me.

He's actually quite
good at this, Gryff.

Get stuffed.
He's a buffoon.

405

Well...
We ride north.

406
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,062
Actually,
they headed west.

407
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,733
The northern road cuts through a plain.
Nowhere to take cover.

408

The western road
runs next to a forest.

409
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:18,676
That's where they
would've made camp.

we're going to find them.

What's it saying?

going to find out here is death.

A bit dramatic.

Dramatic, yeah,
unless it's true,

420
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:47,082
and then we should consider it
an accurate warning, I think.

of Freya of the Frost.

00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,055
That's a good one.

493
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,515
What he say?
That's all right.

494
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:22,434
No. No, I'm not having it.
(SHUSHING) Aye.

495
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:24,801
You ought to hold your tongue,
mate, before you lose it.

496
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:26,105
Is that so?

497
00:43:26,188 --> 00:43:28,482
You know, if it was just me,
I wouldn't be worried.

498
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:31,402
If it was me and him,
I'd be a tiny bit worried,

499
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,153
because he's
a bit of a waster.

500
00:43:33,237 --> 00:43:34,238
Not true.

501
00:43:34,405 --> 00:43:36,990
But none of that matters,
because we're with him.

502
00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:41,286
And he will gut you like a deer
quicker than you can blink.

503
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:43,080
Because this man here,

504
00:43:43,914 --> 00:43:45,249
this man is the Huntsman.

505
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,501
Is this true?

506
00:43:48,419 --> 00:43:49,586
Are you the Huntsman?

507
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,091
That's me.
Well...

508
00:43:56,093 --> 00:43:57,845
The thing of it is...

509
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:02,641
We're all Huntsmen.

510
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:06,437
I'm sorry.
It's all right.

Wait, wait, wait.

513

Can we not
talk about this?

514
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:03,327
You call yourself
a Huntsman?

515
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:08,165
I expected more from a man who had
the courage to betray his queen.

516
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:10,834
And for what?

517
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:13,003
For the love of
some spineless woman?

518

(GRUNTS)

519
00:45:20,052 --> 00:45:22,304
Maybe you were something
in your day, brother,

520
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:24,389
but that day is long gone.

521
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,687
Have you made your peace?

522
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:33,357
(LAUGHS) I'll have
it soon enough.

523
00:45:34,024 --> 00:45:36,276
Tell Freya
I died a free man.

524
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,111
Freya doesn't care
how you die.

525
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,115
No one cares.

526
00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:44,827
You're already forgotten.

(GRUNTS)

540
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:19,129
I tied you up.

541
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:21,423
She his wife
or something?

542
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,342
No. Can't be.
His wife's dead.

543
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:25,719
Dead?

544
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,056
Is that what
you told everyone?

545
00:47:29,932 --> 00:47:33,518
You poor,
heartbroken widower.

546
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:37,439
That story must've wet the
eyes of many a young lass.

547
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,317
Maybe more
than their eyes.

548
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:43,779
No, no...
No, you're dead.

549
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:45,697
I saw you die.

550
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:49,034
This is not real.
This is not happening.

551
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:51,745
You're a ghost.
(CHUCKLES)

552
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:53,163
Or else I'm...

553
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:56,667
Or else I'm dead.

554
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,460
Am I not alive?

555
00:47:58,627 --> 00:47:59,920
You're alive.

556
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:01,463
Although,
you should be dead.

557
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:03,340
You got hit on
the head like, six...

558
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:04,901
What do you think, six or seven?
Seven.

559
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:06,176
Seven times. A lot.

560
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:09,096
So this is...
Real.

561
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:11,515
Very.

562
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:19,022
Did you think
I'd forget?

563
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:23,860
Did you think
I'd forgive?

564
00:48:26,196 --> 00:48:28,073
Stand or fall,
you said.

565
00:48:28,824 --> 00:48:31,535
You'd never leave
my side, you said.

566
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:34,371
You swore it.

567
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:39,543
And then you fled.

568
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:42,045
I see you fight,
and I see you run.

569
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:11,658
No, Sara.
That's not what happened.

570
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:14,244
I saw Tull kill you.

571
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:16,806
I saw him kill you, with my own eyes.
I would never leave you.

572
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,499
But I saw you leave me,
with my own eyes.

573
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,794
And you, of all people,
should know

574
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:25,213
Tull could
never kill me.

575
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,673
Sara.

576
00:49:26,757 --> 00:49:28,383
Don't.
I swear to you.

577
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,093
She put me
in her dungeon.

578
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,429
For seven years.

579
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:36,016
And when I finally escaped,
I swore I'd find you.

580
00:49:36,183 --> 00:49:38,101
It's taken me a long time.

581
00:49:40,854 --> 00:49:42,731
But here we are.

582

That I'd abandon you?

585
00:49:54,201 --> 00:49:55,202
Aye.

Yeah. Yeah,
I probably should have said something.

591
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:13,386
Mmm-hmm.

592
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:18,141
She's got two more
little ones in her left boot.

593

It's no longer important.

00:50:31,655 --> 00:50:33,448
It should be
the last thing you see.

(CHUCKLES)

609
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:11,213
So, what happens
if Freya gets this mirror?

610
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:14,883
Don't you think
that you and me

611
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:17,636
have other things
to discuss, like us?

No.

613
00:52:19,763 --> 00:52:21,097
What happens?

00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:25,602
She'd be unstoppable.

What did you
do that for?

619
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:39,407
No horses,
no tracks.

620
00:52:39,491 --> 00:52:41,660
We keep off the road,
out of sight.

621
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:44,496
(CHUCKLES) So you're
coming with me, then?

622
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:46,998
No, you're coming with me.

623
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:50,085
Yeah, whatever you
need to tell yourself, that's fine.

624
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:53,546
From what I can see, your wee band
won't do too well without me.

625
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,090
Huh?
No...

626
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:59,052
SARA: Whatever power this mirror contains,
I'll not let Freya wield it.

627
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:01,805
We'll find it,
and we'll bring it to the Sanctuary.

628
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:04,099
And then you and I

629
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:06,059
will part forever.

630
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,228
Now.

631
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,438
Tell me about this.

632
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:16,403
What do you think?
About what?

633
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,989
The woman.
Do you trust her?

634
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:22,575
Well, I mean, I don't think
we've got much of a choice.

635
00:53:23,076 --> 00:53:25,412
Besides, she's pretty
good in a scrap.

636
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:28,123
I imagine that would come
in handy before too long.

637
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,417
We'll hit Callan Crossing
by nightfall.

638
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,700
There's a market there.
They might have sold the Mirror.

639
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:35,380
Tracking never was one
of your strengths, was it?

640
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:38,049
I cannae wait to find out
what yours is.

641
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:39,801
If an enemy uses
diamonds for arrows,

642
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:42,053
I doubt they need to sell
the Mirror for money.

643
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:44,097
Well, if you don't like my plan,
you can piss off.

644
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:46,141
That is charming!

645
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:48,893
And you can piss off, too,
as you so eloquently put it,

646
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:50,645
but that's not
gonna get rid of me.

647
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:52,939
You're still my wife.

648
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:58,862
Look, we were deceived.

649
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:01,156
The ice wall that
Freya put between us,

650
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:03,324
she showed us
what she wanted us to see.

651
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:07,370
Wait.

652
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:09,497
And what if I'm right?

653
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:12,417
Do we not deserve
that chance?

654
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,170
It wouldn't matter.

You'd leave again.

We blind ourselves to the
truth because we're weak,

because we hope.

658
00:54:21,593 --> 00:54:23,386
But there's
no hope for love.

659
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:26,347
Love ends in betrayal.

Oh, what?
The hidden dwarf trap was unexpected?

783
00:59:57,428 --> 00:59:58,888
How did he die?

own eyes out?

Keep flapping your gob
and you'll find out.

786
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:10,024
I'm sorry about before.

787
01:00:10,108 --> 01:00:12,068
I would've
drunk your water.

788
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:14,737
You seemed thirsty.

789
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:17,532
Yeah, I was.

790
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:21,869
I get thirsty sometimes if it's hot,
or if I'm running.

791
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:24,372
Me, too!
(LAUGHS)

792
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:28,084
Or sometimes if I eat something
really salty, like, um...

793
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:30,253
Roast chicken.
Chicken.

794
01:00:41,889 --> 01:00:43,891
I know why
you're not talking.

795

Do you?

796
01:00:45,852 --> 01:00:49,272
Aye. You noticed the sparks
between me and Mrs. Bromwyn.

797

I don't know what to say.
She's my type.

Well, it's what
I'm used it, isn't it?

800
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:58,531
I'm awfully sure you'll
have a good life together.

801
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:00,616
Aye, we would.

802
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,160
But there's a problem.

803
01:01:02,243 --> 01:01:03,828
Another woman.

804
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,080
Bit taller.
Not as pretty, mind you.

805
01:01:06,164 --> 01:01:09,417
She sounds far too clever
to waste her time with you.

806
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:11,919
Well, I remember

807
01:01:12,003 --> 01:01:14,589
that one time we were caught
up in a net together.

808
01:01:14,672 --> 01:01:16,924
This was a long,
long time ago.

809
01:01:17,008 --> 01:01:19,760
Are you not the hero
of every story you tell?

810
01:01:19,844 --> 01:01:21,721
That's because
I'm very brave.

811
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:24,408
Which is why I'm going to
save you from drowning.

812
01:01:24,432 --> 01:01:25,433
And how do you expect...

813
01:01:28,102 --> 01:01:30,688
Some unpredictable
waters around here.

814
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:32,398
It's not me.

815
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:36,527

01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:53,813
But I'm forever your queen.

984
01:18:53,897 --> 01:18:56,024
Isn't that right, Sara?

985
01:18:57,442 --> 01:19:00,904
You see,
you abandoned her, Eric.

986
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:03,448
But not I.

987
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:07,744
I raised her from despair.

988
01:19:08,703 --> 01:19:11,998
Made her the point of my spear,
my tempered steel.

989
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:15,544
She's laid
waste to kingdoms

990
01:19:15,627 --> 01:19:18,922
and brought men such
as you to their knees.

991
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,676
She's everything
that you're not.

992
01:19:23,051 --> 01:19:24,761
All I had to do
was send her to you,

993
01:19:24,844 --> 01:19:27,305
and you led her
straight to the Mirror.

994
01:19:27,389 --> 01:19:29,057
It's pathetic.

995
01:19:30,809 --> 01:19:32,352
(WHISPERS)
Oh, what are these?

996
01:19:33,103 --> 01:19:34,396
Dwarves.

997
01:19:36,398 --> 01:19:37,983
(LAUGHING)
They're just like children.

998
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:40,068
We're mighty far from children,
Bitch Queen.

999
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:45,949
Adorable.

1000
01:19:47,617 --> 01:19:48,785
Bring me the Mirror.

1001
01:19:48,952 --> 01:19:50,203
You'll have to
kill me first!

1002
01:19:51,746 --> 01:19:54,249
No, I won't.

1003
01:19:57,377 --> 01:19:58,670
NION: Doreena, no!

1004
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:03,925
You knew, didn't you?

1005
01:20:04,968 --> 01:20:07,804
You knew she'd betray you
and you spared her still.

1006
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:19,065
Have you learnt
my lesson at last?

1007
01:20:20,317 --> 01:20:22,402
Harden your heart,
Queen of Winter.

1008
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:24,237
Bury the world
in a tomb of ice.

1009
01:20:24,321 --> 01:20:25,488
It matters not.

1010
01:20:26,364 --> 01:20:27,824
Love will endure.

1011
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:31,703
Yes, perhaps
you're right.

1012
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:35,332
Shall we find out?

1013
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:44,716
(IN SOFT VOICE) Kill him.

1014
01:21:43,525 --> 01:21:44,901
Is he dead?

1015
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:46,653
I think so.

1016
01:21:47,362 --> 01:21:48,780
What do we do?

1017
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:51,241
Pull it out.

1018
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:53,743
Go on.

1019
01:21:55,745 --> 01:21:57,664
One, two...

1020
01:21:57,747 --> 01:21:58,748
Quickly!

1021
01:21:58,832 --> 01:22:00,417
(GRUNTS)
(BOTH SCREAMING)

1022
01:22:03,753 --> 01:22:05,672
Bloody hell, that hurt.

1023
01:22:06,506 --> 01:22:08,425
I don't believe it!
She missed!

1024
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:17,392
She never misses.

1025
01:22:18,518 --> 01:22:19,998
MRS. BROMWYN:
Have you lost your mind?

1026
01:22:20,645 --> 01:22:22,480
She betrayed us.

1027
01:22:22,564 --> 01:22:24,941
Eric, she is not Cupid.

1028
01:22:25,108 --> 01:22:28,987
I doubt that an arrow to the chest
is an expression of her love.

1029
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:30,071
No, no, no.

1030
01:22:30,822 --> 01:22:33,283
There is a grand design
at work here, friends.

1031
01:22:33,366 --> 01:22:35,452
And it grows even louder.

1032
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,122
Head injury.
Number eight.

1033
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:42,667
She never misses.

1034
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:52,886
Look, I am twice
as angry as you are.

1035
01:22:53,803 --> 01:22:56,306
Doreena was the only friend
I had in this world,

1036
01:22:56,389 --> 01:22:57,932
but you need to face facts.

1037
01:22:58,016 --> 01:22:59,893
Sara is not on your side.

1038
01:23:00,518 --> 01:23:03,271
I don't need you to
believe what I believe.

1039
01:23:03,855 --> 01:23:05,148
What are these for, exactly?

1040
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,653
I'll give you a hint.

1041
01:23:10,695 --> 01:23:12,947
We're not gonna
carry them on our backs. (CHUCKLING)

1042
01:23:13,531 --> 01:23:16,951
So, what are you gonna do?
Trek all the way to the frozen North?

1043
01:23:17,035 --> 01:23:19,454
Face down an evil sorceress
and her entire army?

1044
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:21,247
Aye.

1045
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,001
All right, I'm in!

1046
01:23:56,366 --> 01:24:00,161
Tull, put the dwarves in the gallery
and bring the Mirror to my sanctum.

1047
01:24:05,583 --> 01:24:08,211
Welcome home, Sara.

1048
01:24:33,987 --> 01:24:35,822
RAVENNA: <i>Freya.</i>

01:24:45,832 --> 01:24:48,835

01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:55,717

01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:21,951
Mirror, Mirror on the wall,

1059
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:26,122
who is the fairest
of them all?

1060
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:29,667
(RUMBLING)

1061
01:26:48,788 --> 01:26:51,416
Do not back away from me.

1062
01:26:52,709 --> 01:26:54,836
You asked a question.

1063
01:26:55,712 --> 01:26:57,422
The Mirror has answered.

1064
01:26:58,047 --> 01:27:00,174
Ravenna, how?

1065
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:03,052
Are you not dead?

1066
01:27:03,219 --> 01:27:04,387
Yes.

1067
01:27:06,556 --> 01:27:07,598
No.

1068
01:27:09,726 --> 01:27:12,687
Something in between.

1069
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:17,608
You've become
quite literal, Freya.

1070
01:27:18,568 --> 01:27:20,653
Of all people,
you should know

1071
01:27:21,988 --> 01:27:25,074
that is but a vessel.

1072
01:27:26,951 --> 01:27:28,619
I left my body.

1073
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:31,664
I went into the Mirror.

1074
01:27:32,582 --> 01:27:34,584
And there I stayed.

1075
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,004
I became part of it.

1076
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,131
Trapped.

1077
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:43,843
Until you released me.

1078
01:27:48,598 --> 01:27:51,225
We have much to do,
little sister.

1079
01:27:51,976 --> 01:27:55,021
With you and your
army by my side,

1080
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:57,815
I will regain
my kingdom once more.

1081
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:01,527
Snow White

1082
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:04,030
shall kneel before me.

1083
01:28:04,197 --> 01:28:05,198
(CLINKING)

1084
01:28:07,408 --> 01:28:10,036
She will beg for mercy.

1085
01:28:11,746 --> 01:28:14,415
And then I'll tear
her heart out.

1086
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:23,925
MRS. BROMWYN: Oh, that's a bit
bigger than I imagined.

1087
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:26,385
GRYFF:
So what's the plan?

1088
01:28:29,305 --> 01:28:30,348
You have got a plan?

1089
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:32,100
Aye.

1090
01:28:32,642 --> 01:28:33,684
Is it any good?

1091
01:28:34,352 --> 01:28:35,394
No.

1092
01:28:36,145 --> 01:28:37,271
But it's simple.

1093
01:28:37,855 --> 01:28:40,900
Freya will be in her sanctum,
below the steeple.

1094
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:44,362
I'll make my way down from the top,
find her, and kill her.

1095
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,155
What about
Nion and Doreena?

1096
01:28:46,322 --> 01:28:49,158
I've got someone on the inside
who's gonna help me find them.

1097
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:50,952
Who?
You.

1098
01:28:53,246 --> 01:28:55,998
You have given
my Huntsmen new orders.

1099
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,001
Better orders.

1100
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:02,964
We will attack tomorrow
in two waves.

1101
01:29:03,047 --> 01:29:04,340
Flanking maneuver.

1102
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,342
I presumed
you would agree.

1103
01:29:06,509 --> 01:29:08,803
It's a far
superior tactic.

1104
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:10,555
This is my kingdom.

1105
01:29:10,721 --> 01:29:13,474
Did you say something?
This is my kingdom!

1106
01:29:14,976 --> 01:29:16,769
Of course it is.

1107
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:20,231
And it always will be.

1108
01:29:21,315 --> 01:29:24,277
I would never question
my sister's rule.

1109
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:28,197
But beyond these walls

1110
01:29:29,824 --> 01:29:31,367
is my kingdom.

1111
01:29:35,121 --> 01:29:36,956
My dominion.

1112
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:41,711
Do not forget
what you owe me.

1113
01:29:42,378 --> 01:29:44,714
I made you
what you are.

1114
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:53,973
MAN: Come on.
Move along. Faster.

1115
01:29:54,891 --> 01:29:56,225
Follow your brother.

1116
01:30:01,564 --> 01:30:03,107
Look lively now.

1117
01:30:04,609 --> 01:30:06,652
You as well. Go on.

1118
01:30:07,612 --> 01:30:08,946
Shut it.

1119
01:30:09,614 --> 01:30:12,074
Stop sniveling. Twerp.

1120
01:30:14,535 --> 01:30:15,745
MRS. BROMWYN:
Keep walking.

1121
01:30:16,329 --> 01:30:17,830
Just keep walking.

1122
01:30:31,427 --> 01:30:33,846
It's not my sister's fault,
my lord.

1123
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:37,225
She was hit in the face
as a baby with a rock.

1124
01:30:40,645 --> 01:30:41,896
You two,
come with me.

1125
01:30:55,076 --> 01:30:56,118
(GRUNTING)

1126
01:31:04,502 --> 01:31:06,671
Did you have to hit him so hard?
Shut up.

1127
01:31:12,009 --> 01:31:13,010
(GRUNTING)

1128
01:31:15,304 --> 01:31:16,806
He's very heavy.

1129
01:31:18,266 --> 01:31:19,267
Right.

1130
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:22,645
We stuff him in here,
we cover our tracks.

1131
01:31:32,738 --> 01:31:34,407
That's very sloppy
work, that is.

1132
01:31:38,077 --> 01:31:39,078
(GRUNTING)

1133
01:32:15,573 --> 01:32:16,949

1134
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:28,502

(LAUGHING)

1138
01:33:00,326 --> 01:33:02,495
This is the worst plan ever.

1139
01:33:03,329 --> 01:33:04,330
(GRUNTS)

1140
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:16,801
PIPPA: Stop.

1141
01:33:29,271 --> 01:33:31,524
You don't remember me,
do you?

1142
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:35,861
No.

1143
01:33:38,364 --> 01:33:40,074
This is my war face.

1144
01:33:42,368 --> 01:33:43,536
Pippa.

1145
01:33:47,206 --> 01:33:49,166
