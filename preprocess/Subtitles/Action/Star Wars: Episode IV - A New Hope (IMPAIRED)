Very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,718
Can you speak Bocce?

170
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,274
Of course I can, sir.
It's like a second language to me...

171
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,628
Yeah, all right. Shut up.
I'll take this one.

Take these two over
to the garage, will you?

174
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,715
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

175
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,829
But I was going into Tosche Station...

176
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,279
to pick up some power converters.

177
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,799
You can waste time
with your friends...

178
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,319
when your chores are done.

179

Now come on. Get to it.

Yeah?

188
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,434
This R2 unit has
a bad motivator. Look.

00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,835
Hey, what are you
trying to push on us?

Excuse me, sir...

192
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,070
but that R2 unit is in prime condition,
a real bargain.

Uncle Owen, what about that one?

194
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,794
What about that blue one?

195
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,150
We'll take that one.

196
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,429
Take this away.

You'll be very pleased
with that one, sir.

He really is in first-class condition.

I've worked with him before.

Why I should stick
my neck out for you...

00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,511
is quite beyond my capacity.

Is there anything I might do to help?

No. Not unless you can alter time...

speed up the harvest,
or teleport me off this rock.

I don't think so, sir.

about such things...

not on this planet, anyway.

As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

222
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,475
Well, if there's
a bright centre to the universe...

you're on the planet

You got a lot of carbon scoring.

Looks like you boys have
seen a lot of action.

235

With all we've been through...

236
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,152
sometimes I'm amazed we're in
as good condition as we are...

237
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,599
what with the rebellion and all.

238
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,517
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?!

239

That's how we came
to be in your service...

if you take my meaning, sir.

241

Have you been in many battles?

242
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,588
Several, I think.

243
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,153
Actually, there's not much to tell.

244

I'm not much more
than an interpreter...

and not very good at telling stories.

246

Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

Well, my little friend...

in here real good.

a resident of these parts...

Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what
he's talking about.

we've been through...

this little R2 unit has
become a bit eccentric.

I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

I don't know any Obi-Wan...

but old Ben lives out
beyond the Dune Sea.

called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

I thought he might have meant old Ben.

Do you know what
he's talking about?

Mm-mm.

That wizard's just a crazy old man.

Tomorrow, I want you to take
that R2 unit to Anchorhead...

00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,559
and have its memory erased.

That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

I don't think he exists any more.

330
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,675
He died about the same time
as your father.

331
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,994
He knew my father?

332
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,758
I told you to forget it.

333
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,078
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

334
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,031
In the morning, I want them
up there on the south ridge...

335
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,912
working on those condensers.

336
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,029
Yes, sir.

337
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,869
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

338
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,549
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking
about our agreement...

339
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,752
about me staying on another season?

340
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,950
And if these new droids
do work out...

341
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,911
I want to transmit my application
to the academy this year.

342
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,679
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

343
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,518
Sure. There's more
than enough droids.

344
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,551
Harvest is when I need you the most.

345
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,591
It's only one season more.

346
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,233
This year we'll make
enough on the harvest...

347
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,873
that I'll be able
to hire more hands...

348
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,798
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

349
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,558
You must understand
I need you here, Luke.

350
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,352
But it's a whole 'nother year!

351
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,833
Look, it's only one more season.

352
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,951
Yeah, that's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

353
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,956
Where are you going?

354
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,229
Looks like I'm going nowhere.

355
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,078
I have to go finish
cleaning those droids.

356
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,031
Owen, he can't stay here forever.

357
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,388
Most of his friends have gone.

358
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,511
It means so much to him.

359
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,312
I'll make it up to him next year.

360
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,395
I promise.

361
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,751
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.

362
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,791
He has too much of his father in him.

363
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,876
That's what I'm afraid of.

364
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,038
Ooh!

365
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,513
What are you doing
hiding back there?

366
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,791
It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.

367
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,639
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

368
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,239
Kept babbling on about his mission.

369
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,918
Oh, no.

370
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,233
That R2 unit has always
been a problem.

371
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,749
These astrodroids
are getting quite out of hand.

372
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,757
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

373
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,279
How could I be so stupid?

374
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,515
He's nowhere in sight.

375
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,914
Blast it!

376
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,349
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?

377
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,072
It's too dangerous
with all the Sandpeople around.

378
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,156
We'll have to wait until morning.

379
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,429
Uncle Owen:
Luke! I'm shutting the power down.

380
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,835
All right!
I'll be there in a few minutes.

381
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,359
Boy, am I gonna get it.

382
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,199
That little droid's going to
cause me a lotta trouble.

383
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,550
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

384
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,999
Come on.

385
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,309
Luke?

386
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,635
Luke!

387
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,354
Luke!

388
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,035
Have you seen Luke this morning?

389
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,071
He said he had some things to do
before he started today...

390
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,428
so he left early.

391
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,913
Did he take those
two new droids with him?

392
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,439
I think so.

393
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,028
Well, he better have those units
in the south range...

394
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,515
repaired by midday,
or there'll be hell to pay.

395
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,438
Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.

396
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,993
Dead ahead.

397
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,998
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator!

398
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,959
[Speaking Alien Language]

you think you're going?

Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

402
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,078
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

[Beep]

404
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,794
And don't talk to me
of your mission, either.

00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,114
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you...

406
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,593
into a million pieces right here!

407
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,711
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,191
What's wrong with him now?

410
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,470
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

411
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,275
Sandpeople, or worse.

412

Come on.
Let's go have a look.

Come on!

414
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,511
Well, there are
two Banthas down there...

415
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,517
but I don't see any...
Wait a second.

416
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,959
They're Sandpeople, all right.

417
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,719
I can see one of them now.

Rest easy, son.
You've had a busy day.

You're fortunate
to be all in one piece.

Ben Kenobi?

00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,993
what brings you out this far?

435
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,712
This little droid.

[Blip Blip]

437
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,199
I think he's searching
for his former master...

438
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,551
but I've never seen such devotion
in a droid before.

439
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,511
He claims to be the property...

440
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,153
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

441
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,395
Is he a relative of yours?

442
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,795
Do you know who
he's talking about?

443
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,956
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

444
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,550
Obi-Wan.

445
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,390
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

446
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,829
A long time.

I think my uncle knows him.

00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,713
He said he was dead.

Oh, he's not dead.

Not yet.

Well, of course I know him.

Well, then the droid
does belong to you.

Can you stand?

We've got to get out of here before
the Sandpeople return.

I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

469
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,160
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account.

What kind of talk is that?

Quickly. They're on the move.

474
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,796
No, my father didn't
fight in the wars.

475
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,592
He was a navigator
on a spice freighter.

476
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,472
That's what your uncle told you.

477
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,318
He didn't hold
with your father's ideals.

478
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,555
Thought he should
have stayed here...

479
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,432
and not gotten involved.

480
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,391
You fought in the Clone Wars?

481
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,273
Yes. I was once a Jedi knight...

482
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,628
the same as your father.

483

I wish I'd known him.

484
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,549
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

485
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,159
and a cunning warrior.

486
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,156
I understand you've become...

487
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,874
quite a good pilot yourself.

488
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,753
And he was a good friend.

489
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,916
Which reminds me...

490
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,634
I have something here for you.

00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,439
Your father wanted you to have this...

492
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,879
when you were old enough...

493
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,956
but your uncle
wouldn't allow it.

494
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,559
He feared you might
follow old Obi-Wan...

495
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,557
on some damn-fool
idealistic crusade...

496
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,352
like your father did.

497
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,198
Sir, if you'll not be needing me...

498
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,230
I'll close down for a while.

499
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,952
Sure. Go ahead.

500
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,032
What is it?

501
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,799
It's your father's lightsabre.

502
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,037
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

503
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,630
Not as clumsy or random
as a blaster.

504
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,596
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.

505
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,836
For over a thousand generations...

506
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,757
the Jedi knights were the guardians...

507
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,792
of peace and justice
in the old Republic...

508
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,593
before the dark times...

509
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,233
before the Empire.

510
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,989
How did my father die?

511
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,192
Ayoung Jedi named Darth Vader...

512
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,312
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

513
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,274
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

514
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,314
He betrayed and
murdered your father.

515
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,194
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

516
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,996
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

517
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,553
The Force?

518
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,911
The Force is what gives
a Jedi his power.

519
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,919
It's an energy field created
by all living things.

520
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,792
It surrounds us, penetrates us...

521
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,876
it binds the galaxy together.

522
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,314
[Beep Blip Blip Beep]

523
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,993
Now let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend...

524
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,951
and where you come from.

525
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,593
I saw part of a message he was...

526
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,631
I seem to have found it.

527
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,673
General Kenobi, years ago
you served my father in the Clone Wars.

528
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,074
Now he begs you to help him...

529
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,316
in his struggle against the Empire.

530
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,079
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person.

531
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,077
But my ship has fallen under attack...

532
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,316
and I am afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

533
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,078
I have placed information...

534
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,758
vital to the survival
of the rebellion...

535
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,632
into the memory systems
of this R2 unit.

536
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,478
My father will know
how to retrieve it.

537
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,158
You must see this droid...

538
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,714
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.

539
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,478
This is our most desperate hour.

540
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,513
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

541
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,474
You must learn
the ways of the Force...

542
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,716
if you're to come
with me to Alderaan.

543
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,149
Alderaan?
I'm not going to Alderaan.

544
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,679
I've got to get home.

545
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,074
It's late.
I'm in for it as it is.

546
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,839
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

547
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,952
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

548
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,159
I can't get involved.

549
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,555
I've got work to do.

550
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,114
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it...

551
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,312
but there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

552
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,476
It's all such a long way from here.

553
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,477
That's your uncle talking.

554
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,749
My uncle.

555
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,269
How am I ever gonna explain this?

556
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,072
Learn about the Force, Luke.

557
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,910
Look, I can take you
as far as Anchorhead.

558
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,874
You can get a transport there to
Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

559
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,788
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

560
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,196
Until this battle station
is fully operational...

561
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,673
we are vulnerable.

562
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,756
The Rebel Alliance
is too well equipped.

563
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,757
They're more dangerous
than you realize.

564
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,155
Dangerous to
your starfleet, Commander...

565
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,350
not to this battle station.

566
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,074
The rebellion will
continue to gain support...

567
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,792
in the Imperial Senate...

568
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,912
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

569
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,519
I have just received word...

570
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,074
that the emperor has
dissolved the council permanently.

571
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,634
The last remnants
of the old Republic...

572
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,113
have been swept away.

573
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,832
That's impossible.

574
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,110
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

575
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,993
The regional governors
now have direct control...

576
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,758
over their territories.

577
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,759
Fear will keep
the local systems in line...

578
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,199
fear of this battle station.

579
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,072
And what of the rebellion?

580
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,997
If the rebels have obtained...

581
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,314
a complete technical readout
of this station...

582
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,032
it is possible, however unlikely...

583
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,355
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

584
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,519
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.

585
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,949
Any attack made by the rebels
against this station...

586
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,354
would be a useless gesture...

587
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,710
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

588
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,276
This station is now the ultimate power
in the universe.

589
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,595
I suggest we use it.

590
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,073
Don't be too proud...

591
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,316
of this technological terror
you've constructed.

592
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,671
The ability to destroy
a planet is insignificant...

593
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,950
next to the power of the Force.

594
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,356
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

595
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,278
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

596
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,755
hasn't helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

597
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,757
or given you
clairvoyance enough...

598
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,996
to find the rebels'
hidden fortre...

599
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,439
I find your lack
of faith disturbing.

600
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,788
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.

601
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,433
As you wish.

602
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,476
This bickering is pointless.

603
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,151
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

604
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,953
by the time this station
is operational.

605
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,310
We will then crush the rebellion...

606
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,793
with one swift stroke.

607
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,231
It looks like the Sandpeople
did this, all right.

608
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,998
Look. There's gaffi sticks,
Bantha tracks.

609
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,109
It's just, I've never heard of them...

610
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,150
hitting anything this big before.

611
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,269
They didn't...

612
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,755
but we are meant to think they did.

613
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,677
These tracks are side-by-side.

614
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,870
Sandpeople always ride single file...

615
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,797
to hide their numbers.

616
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,115
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

617
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,550
And these blast points,
too accurate...

618
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,954
for Sandpeople.

619
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,356
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

620
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,517
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

621
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,950
If they traced the robots here...

622
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,229
they may have learned
who they sold them to...

623
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,271
and that would lead
them back... home!

624
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,879
Wait, Luke!

625
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,877
It's too dangerous!

626
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,153
Uncle Owen!

627
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,589
Aunt Beru!

628
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,994
Uncle Owen!

629
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,439
And now, Your Highness...

630
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,357
we will discuss the location...

631
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,630
of your hidden rebel base.

632
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,477
There's nothing you could
have done, Luke...

633
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,079
had you been there.

634
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,838
You'd have been killed, too...

635
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,396
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

636
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,035
I want to come
with you to Alderaan.

637
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,832
There's nothing for me here now.

638
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,076
I want to learn
the ways of the Force...

639
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,633
and become a Jedi
like my father.

640
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,959
Obi-Wan: Mos Eisley spaceport.

641
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:01,074
You will never find a more
wretched hive of scum and villainy.

642
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,077
We must be cautious.

643
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,038
[Chattering]

644
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,753
[Braying]

645
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,956
How long have you
had these droids?

646
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,229
Three or four seasons.

647
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,588
They're up for sale
if you want them.

648
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,472
Let me see your identification.

649
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,751
You don't need to see
his identification.

650
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,110
We don't need to see

01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,318
What the...

971
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,157
Arrghh arrgh!

972
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,555
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower.

973
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,829
Some kind of asteroid collision.

974
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:52,836
It's not on any of the charts.

975
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,154
What's going on?

976
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,430
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

977
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,754
What do you mean?
Where is it?

978
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,074
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, kid.

979
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,519
It ain't there. It's
been totally blown away.

980
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,516
What? How?

981
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,198
Destroyed by the Empire.

982
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,515
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy
the whole planet.

983
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,914
It would take 1,000 ships
with more firepower than...

984
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,712
[Beep]

985
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,558
There's another ship coming in.

986
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,590
Maybe they know what happened.

987
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,869
It's an imperial fighter.

988
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,515
It followed us!

989
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,551
No. It's a short-range fighter.

990
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,591
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

991
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,392
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.

992
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,396
If they identify us,
we're in big trouble.

993
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,430
Not if I can help it.

994
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,549
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

995
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,510
It would be as well to let it go.

996
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,516
It's too far out of range.

997
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,789
Not for long.

998
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,559
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

999
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,194
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

1000
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,878
Well, he ain't gonna
be around long enough...

1001
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,069
to tell anybody about us.

1002
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,198
Luke: Look at him.
He's heading for that small moon.

1003
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:49,834
Han: I think I can get him before
he gets there. He's almost in range.

1004
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,271
That's no moon.

1005
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,799
It's a space station.

1006
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,638
It's too big to be a space station.

1007
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,149
I have a very bad feeling about this.

1008
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,952
Turn the ship around.

1009
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,150
Yeah. I think you're right.
Full reverse!

1010
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,396
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power.

1011
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,795
Chewie, lock in
the auxiliary power!

1012
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,718
Luke: Why are we still
moving towards it?!

1013
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,558
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in!

1014
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,238
There's got to be
something you can do!

1015
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,679
There's nothing
I can do about it, kid.

1016
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,949
I'm at full power.
I'm gonna have to shut down.

1017
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,513
They're not gonna
get me without a fight.

1018
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,108
You can't win...

1019
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,276
but there are alternatives
to fighting.

1020
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,270
Clear Bay 327.

1021
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,630
We are opening
the magnetic field.

1022
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:09,829
To your stations!

1023
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,188
Come with me.

1024
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,439
Close all outboard shields.

1025
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,437
Close all outboard shields.

1026
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,829
- [Beep]
- Yes?

1027
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,313
We've captured a freighter...

1028
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,668
entering the remains
of the Alderaan system.

1029
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,438
Its markings match
those of a ship...

1030
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,869
that blasted its way
out of Mos Eisley.

1031
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,356
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

1032
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,278
She may yet be of some use to us.

1033
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:42,628
Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9.
Release charge.

1034
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,316
316, report to control.

1035
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,157
There's no one on board, sir.

1036
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,874
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after take-off.

1037
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,797
It must be a decoy, sir.

1038
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,319
Several of the escape pods
have been jettisoned.

1039
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,270
Did you find any droids?

1040
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,230
No, sir.

1041
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,191
If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned.

1042
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,753
Send a scanning crew aboard.

1043
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,598
I want every part
of this ship checked.

1044
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,630
Yes, sir.

1045
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,079
I sense something...

1046
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,033
a presence I've not felt since...

1047
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,079
Get me a scanning crew in here
on the double.

1048
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,838
I want every part
of this ship checked.

1049
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,437
There's no one here.

1050
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,637
Boy, it's lucky you had
these compartments.

1051
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,113
I use them for smuggling.

1052
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,798
I never thought I'd
be smuggling myself in 'em.

1053
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,194
This is ridiculous.

1054
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,514
Even if I could take off...

1055
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:43,959
I'd never get past
the tractor beam.

1056
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,433
Leave that to me.

1057
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,199
Damn fool, I knew
that you were gonna say that.

1058
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,548
Who's the more foolish...

1059
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,591
the fool or the fool
who follows him?

1060
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,119
Argh!

1061
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:01,359
The ship's all yours.

1062
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,277
If the scanners pick up anything...

1063
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,197
report it immediately.

1064
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,038
All right, let's go.

1065
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,277
[Thud]

1066
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,719
Han: Hey, down there!

1067
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,636
Could you give us a hand
with this?

1068
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,356
[Zap Zap]

1069
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,673
TK-421, why aren't you
at your post?

1070
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,995
TK-421, do you copy?

1071
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,512
Take over.
We've got a bad transmitter.

1072
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,392
I'll see what I can do.

1073
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,831
Grrr!

1074
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,958
Between his howling and your blasting
everything in sight...

1075
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,514
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

1076
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,073
Bring them on!

1077
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,269
I'd prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin' around.

1078
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,277
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

1079
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,039
Plug in. He should be able to interpret
the entire imperial network.

1080
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,832
[Beep Blip]

1081
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,555
[Blip Bleep Whistle]

1082
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,400
He says he's found
the main controls...

1083
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,795
to the power beam that's
holding the ship here.

1084
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,956
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

1085
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,640
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor...

1086
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,113
in seven locations.

1087
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,673
A power loss
at one of the terminals...

1088
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,234
will allow the ship to leave.

1089
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,079
I don't think you boys can help.

1090
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,838
I must go alone.

1091
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,473
Whatever you say.

1092
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,238
I've done more than I bargained for
on this trip already.

1093
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,759
I want to go with you.

1094
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,030
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.

1095
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,673
They must be delivered safely...

1096
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,678
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

1097
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:09,679
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

1098
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,389
The Force will be with you always.
