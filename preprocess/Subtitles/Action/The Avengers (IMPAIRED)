00:52:58,677 --> 00:53:00,595
Loki's gonna drag this out.

818
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:04,266
So, Thor, what's his play?

819
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:07,060
He has an army called the Chitauri.

820
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:10,146
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

821
00:53:10,564 --> 00:53:12,691
He means to lead them
against your people.

822
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:14,484
They Will Win him the Earth,

823
00:53:14,568 --> 00:53:16,403
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

824
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,321
An army

825
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:20,240
from outer space.

826
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:22,826
So, he's building another portal.

827
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:24,286
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

828
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:25,370
Selvig?

829
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,039
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

830
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,375
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

831
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:32,002
along with one of ours.

832
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:33,837
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

833
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,255
He's not leading an army from here.

834
00:53:35,422 --> 00:53:37,132
I don't think
we should be focusing on Loki.

835
00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:39,175
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

836
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:40,510
You could smell crazy on him.

837
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,429
Have care how you speak.

838
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:44,973
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

839
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:46,600
And he is my brother.

840
00:53:46,892 --> 00:53:48,685
He killed 80 people in two days.

841
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:50,645
He's adopted.

842
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:53,189
I think it's about the mechanics.

843
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:55,358
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

844
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:56,484
It's a stabilising agent.

845
00:53:56,693 --> 00:53:58,028
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

846
00:53:58,153 --> 00:53:59,696
I'll fly you to Portland.

847
00:53:59,863 --> 00:54:01,489
Keep love alive.

848
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:03,575
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

849
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:05,577
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

850
00:54:05,744 --> 00:54:09,039
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

851
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:11,499
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

852
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:14,169
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

853
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:16,838
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

854
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:19,758
That man is playing <i>Galaga.</i>

855
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:24,387
He thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

856
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:27,557
How does Fury even see these?

857
00:54:27,641 --> 00:54:28,683
He turns.

858
00:54:29,184 --> 00:54:30,852
Sounds exhausting.

859
00:54:31,853 --> 00:54:33,104
The rest of the raw materials,

860
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:36,066
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

861
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:37,692
The only major component
he still needs

862
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:41,363
is a power source
of high-energy density.

863
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:44,658
Something to kick-start the Cube.

864
00:54:45,033 --> 00:54:47,744
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

865
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:48,912
Last night.

866
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:52,916
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

867
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:54,125
Am I the only one who did the reading?

868
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:57,087
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

869
00:54:57,253 --> 00:55:00,048
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

870
00:55:00,215 --> 00:55:01,716
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

871
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:04,135
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilise

872
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:05,428
the quantum tunnelling effect.

873
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:06,805
BANNER: Well, if he could do that,

874
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:09,349
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

875
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:11,893
Finally, someone who speaks English.

876
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,937
Is that what just happened?

877
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:16,272
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.

878
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:19,567
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

879
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,569
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

880
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,613
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

881
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:26,408
Thanks.

882
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:29,077
Dr Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

883
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:30,578
I was hoping you might join him.

884
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:31,746
ROGERS:
I would start with that stick of his.

885
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,039
It may be magical,

886
00:55:33,123 --> 00:55:34,582
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

887
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:37,585
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

888
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:39,713
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

889
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:41,589
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

890
00:55:41,673 --> 00:55:43,425
into his personal flying monkeys.

891
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,301
Monkeys? I do not understand.

892
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:46,386
I do.

893
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:51,099
I understood that reference.

894
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:53,643
Shall we play, Doctor?

895
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:55,437
This way, sir.

896
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:11,119
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

897
00:56:11,286 --> 00:56:13,079
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

898
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:15,373
But it's going to take weeks to process.

899
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,791
If we bypass their mainframe

900
00:56:16,875 --> 00:56:18,168
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

901
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:21,463
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

902
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,632
All I packed was a toothbrush.

903
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,302
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

904
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:29,471
Top ten floors, all R&D.

905
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:31,306
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

906
00:56:31,473 --> 00:56:34,059
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

907
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:36,811
I kind of broke Harlem.

908
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:38,813
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

909
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,815
No tension, no surprises.

910
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:42,233
-(ELECTRIC DISCHARGE)
- Ow!

911
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:43,735
- ROGERS: Hey!
- Nothing?

912
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:44,903
Are you nuts?

913
00:56:44,986 --> 00:56:45,987
Jury's out.

914
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:47,405
You really have got
a lid on it, haven't you?

915
00:56:47,489 --> 00:56:48,490
What's your secret?

916
00:56:48,615 --> 00:56:50,075
Mellow jazz, bongo drums
huge bag of weed?

917
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:51,159
Is everything a joke to you?

918
00:56:51,618 --> 00:56:52,619
Funny things are.

919
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:54,579
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

920
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:55,955
isn't funny.

921
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:57,040
No of fence, Doc.

922
00:56:57,123 --> 00:56:58,750
It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

923
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:01,711
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

924
00:57:01,795 --> 00:57:04,172
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

925
00:57:04,506 --> 00:57:06,216
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr Stark.

926
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:07,675
STARK: Do you think I'm not?

927
00:57:07,926 --> 00:57:10,762
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

928
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,555
What isn't he telling us?

929
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,182
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

930
00:57:14,808 --> 00:57:16,142
You think Fury's hiding something?

931
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:19,646
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

932
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:21,564
His secrets have secrets.

933
00:57:21,648 --> 00:57:23,149
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

934
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:24,234
Uh...

935
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,861
I just want to finish my work here, and...

936
00:57:27,529 --> 00:57:28,530
Doctor?

937
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:36,454
"A warm light for all mankind."

938
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:38,540
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

939
00:57:38,748 --> 00:57:39,999
I heard it.

940
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:42,418
I think that was meant for you.

941
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:46,339
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

942
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:47,465
it was still all over the news.

943
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:49,634
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

944
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,095
building in New York?

945
00:57:52,428 --> 00:57:56,182
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

946
00:57:56,266 --> 00:57:58,768
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

947
00:57:58,852 --> 00:58:00,687
It's just the prototype.

948
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,647
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

949
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:04,482
That's what he's getting at.

950
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:07,235
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

951
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:09,195
What are they doing
in the energy business

952
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,572
in the first place?

953
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:13,741
I should probably look into that
once my decryption program

954
00:58:13,867 --> 00:58:15,827
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

955
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:16,870
I'm sorry. Did you say...

956
00:58:16,953 --> 00:58:19,080
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

957
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:20,999
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

958
00:58:21,082 --> 00:58:22,333
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

959
00:58:22,417 --> 00:58:23,376
Blueberry?

960
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:25,211
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

961
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:28,173
An intelligence organisation
that fears intelligence?

962
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:30,133
Historically, not awesome.

963
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:32,510
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

964
00:58:32,594 --> 00:58:34,220
This is a man who means to start a war

965
00:58:34,304 --> 00:58:35,763
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

966
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,559
We have orders.
We should follow them.

967
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:41,936
Following's not really my style.

968
00:58:43,313 --> 00:58:45,732
And you're all about style, aren't you?

969
00:58:45,815 --> 00:58:46,900
Of the people in this room,

970
00:58:46,983 --> 00:58:48,651
which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit,

971
00:58:48,735 --> 00:58:49,903
and, B, not of use?

972
00:58:50,153 --> 00:58:54,282
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

973
00:58:56,993 --> 00:58:58,077
Just find the Cube.

974
00:59:00,747 --> 00:59:02,624
(AGENTS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

975

STARK: That's the guy
my dad never shut up about?

976
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:15,720
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

977
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:17,096
Huh.

978
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,932
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

979
00:59:19,015 --> 00:59:20,850
He does have the jump on us.

980
00:59:20,934 --> 00:59:23,686
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

981
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:25,605
It's going to blow up in his face.

982
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:27,815
And I'm going to be there when it does.

983
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:30,485
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

984
00:59:31,903 --> 00:59:33,738
Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

985
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:34,948
(CHUCKLES)

986
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:39,077
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

987
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,580
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

988
00:59:42,664 --> 00:59:44,165
It's a nightmare.

989
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:47,377
I've got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second

990
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,504
to crawl its way into my heart.

991
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,673
This stops it.

992
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:53,925
This little circle of light,
it's part of me now,

993
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:56,844
not just armour.

994
00:59:57,637 --> 00:59:59,931
It's a terrible privilege.

995
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:02,684
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.

996
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:03,768
It's different.

997
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:07,605
Hey, I read all about your accident.

998
01:00:07,689 --> 01:00:10,900
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

999
01:00:11,192 --> 01:00:13,695
So you're saying that the Hulk...

1000
01:00:15,113 --> 01:00:17,282
The other guy saved my life?

1001
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:18,950
That's nice.

1002
01:00:19,993 --> 01:00:23,705
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

1003
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:26,874
I guess we'll find out.

1004
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,420
You may not enjoy that.

1005
01:00:30,503 --> 01:00:32,505
And you just might.

They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromsø.

1012

She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

1014
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:46,871
She'll be safe.

1015
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,456
Thank you.

1016
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:52,085
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

1017
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:55,713
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

1018
01:01:55,797 --> 01:01:56,964
Erik is a good man.

1019
01:01:57,048 --> 01:01:58,091
He talks about you a lot.

1020
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:02,136
You changed his life.

1021
01:02:03,805 --> 01:02:05,723
You changed everything around here.

1022
01:02:05,807 --> 01:02:07,975
They were better as they were.

1023
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,686
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

1024
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:14,524
but we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

1025
01:02:14,607 --> 01:02:16,484
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

1026
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:19,320
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

1027
01:02:20,405 --> 01:02:22,240
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

1028
01:02:22,323 --> 01:02:24,242
Well, they are repulsive.

1029
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:27,829
And they trample everything
in their path.

1030
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:38,756
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

1031
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:41,092
and your people paid the price.

1032
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:43,177
And now, again.

1033
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,182
In my youth, I courted war.

FURY: War hasn't started yet.

1035
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:54,897
You think you could make Loki tell us

1036
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:56,274
where the Tesseract is?

1037
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:59,694
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

1038
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:04,532
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

1039
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:06,451
There's no pain
would prise his need from him.

1040
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:10,079
A lot of guys think that

1041
01:03:10,163 --> 01:03:11,414
until the pain starts.

1042
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,460
What are you asking me to do?

1043
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:19,046
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

1044
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:20,214
Loki is a prisoner.

1045
01:03:20,465 --> 01:03:22,800
Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

1046
01:03:22,884 --> 01:03:24,260
that wants to be here?

1047
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:40,234
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

1048
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:41,903
But you figured I'd come.

1049
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:44,071
After.

1050
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:48,576
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

1051
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:52,371
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

1052
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,832
And I would cooperate.

1053
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:56,959
I want to know what
you've done to Agent Barton.

1054
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,045
I would say I've expanded his mind.

1055
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:03,758
And once you've won,

1056
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:05,593
once you're king of the mountain,

1057
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:10,389
what happens to his mind?

1058
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:11,474
Oh...

1059
01:04:11,766 --> 01:04:13,392
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

1060
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:16,312
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

1061
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:22,109
Tell me.

1062
01:04:26,614 --> 01:04:29,909
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D... I, uh...

1063
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:36,207
Well, I made a name for myself.

1064
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:39,377
I have a very specific skill set.

1065
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,880
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

1066
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:47,426
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

1067
01:04:48,803 --> 01:04:51,764
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

1068
01:04:52,765 --> 01:04:54,141
He made a different call.

1069
01:04:56,269 --> 01:04:59,146
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

1070
01:04:59,564 --> 01:05:00,982
Not let you out.

1071
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:02,984
No, but I like this.

1072
01:05:03,943 --> 01:05:07,196
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

1073
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:09,574
Regimes fall every day.

1074
01:05:09,657 --> 01:05:12,034
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

1075
01:05:12,118 --> 01:05:13,160
Or I was.

1076
01:05:14,662 --> 01:05:16,163
And what are you now?

1077
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:19,792
It's really not that complicated.

1078
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:24,005
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

1079
01:05:24,964 --> 01:05:26,340
Can you?

1080
01:05:27,842 --> 01:05:31,679
Can you wipe out that much red?

1081
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:34,348
Dreykov's daughter,

1082
01:05:36,017 --> 01:05:37,893
São Paulo,

1083
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:41,230
the hospital fire?

1084
01:05:42,231 --> 01:05:44,609
Barton told me everything.

1085
01:05:44,692 --> 01:05:47,570
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

1086
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,489
and you think saving a man
no more virtuous than yourself

1087
01:05:50,573 --> 01:05:51,949
will change anything?

1088
01:05:52,033 --> 01:05:54,785
This is the basest sentimentality.

1089
01:05:54,869 --> 01:05:57,121
This is a child at prayer.

1090
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:58,372

in every way he knows you fear.

1100
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,616
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work

1101
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:37,495
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

1102

Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

What are you doing, Mr Stark?

1117
01:07:17,785 --> 01:07:20,371
Uh, kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

1118
01:07:20,788 --> 01:07:22,373
You're supposed to be locating
the Tesseract.

1119
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:23,749
BANNER: We are. The model's locked

and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

When we get a hit,

1122
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:28,462
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1123
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:33,050
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1124
01:07:33,134 --> 01:07:34,176
What is "Phase 2"?

Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses

a little slow for me.

1135

1136
01:07:55,948 --> 01:07:57,825
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

1137

Loki is manipulating you.

1138
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,036
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1139
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,663
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

1140

Yes, and I'm not leaving

1141
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:05,458
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

1142

I'd like to know Why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1144
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:12,965

01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:14,842
Me?

1146
01:08:16,177 --> 01:08:18,596
Last year, Earth had a visitor
from another planet

1147
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:21,891
who had a grudge match
that levelled a small town.

1148
01:08:21,974 --> 01:08:24,101
We learned that
not only are we not alone

1149
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:27,938
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1150

My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

1151
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:32,401
But you're not the only people
out there, are you?

1152
01:08:32,485 --> 01:08:34,361
And you're not the only threat.

1153
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:37,531
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

1154
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:39,533
that can't be controlled.

1155
01:08:39,742 --> 01:08:40,910
Like you controlled the Cube?

1156
01:08:40,993 --> 01:08:42,286
Your work with the Tesseract

1157
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:44,955
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1158
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:46,499
It is a signal to all the realms

1159
01:08:46,582 --> 01:08:49,293
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

1160
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:50,461
A higher form?

1161
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:51,670
You forced our hand.

1162
01:08:51,754 --> 01:08:52,755
We had to come up with something.

1163
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:53,839
A nuclear deterrent.

1164
01:08:53,923 --> 01:08:56,008
Because that always
calms everything right down.

1165
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:58,511
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

1166
01:08:58,594 --> 01:09:00,763
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

1167
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,765
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1168
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:03,974
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1169
01:09:04,058 --> 01:09:06,018

more evolved than this.

1170

01:29:04,257 --> 01:29:05,925
<i>They called it.</i>

1455
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:23,818
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1456
01:29:27,155 --> 01:29:29,323
I guess he never did
get you to sign them.

1457
01:29:32,952 --> 01:29:34,662
We're dead in the air up here.

1458
01:29:34,746 --> 01:29:37,874
Our communications,
the location of the Cube,

1459
01:29:38,249 --> 01:29:40,418
Banner, Thor...

1460
01:29:41,878 --> 01:29:43,629
I got nothing for you.

1461
01:29:43,713 --> 01:29:46,632
I lost my one good eye.

1462
01:29:49,635 --> 01:29:52,597
Maybe I had that coming.

1463
01:29:56,893 --> 01:29:58,227
Yes,

1464
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:02,732
we were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1465
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:06,069
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

1466
01:30:06,152 --> 01:30:09,280
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1467
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:17,330
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1468
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:22,585
called the Avengers Initiative.

1469
01:30:23,753 --> 01:30:25,922
The idea was to bring together a group

1470
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:28,591
of remarkable people

1471
01:30:29,342 --> 01:30:32,178
to see if they could become
something more.

1472
01:30:33,513 --> 01:30:37,517
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to,

1473
01:30:37,683 --> 01:30:40,978
to fight the battles that we never could.

1474
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:48,861
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

1475
01:30:51,155 --> 01:30:52,865
In heroes.

1476
01:31:00,873 --> 01:31:02,500
Well,

1477
01:31:03,334 --> 01:31:06,045
it's an old-fashioned notion.

- The whole thing.

Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

This is Loki.

This is monsters and magic,

and nothing we were ever trained for.

Loki, did he get away?

1524
01:33:59,051 --> 01:34:00,052
Yeah.

1525
01:34:00,678 --> 01:34:02,763
I don't suppose you know where.

1526
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:04,890
I didn't need to know.

1527
01:34:04,974 --> 01:34:06,726
I didn't ask.

1528

Well,

1534
01:34:23,576 --> 01:34:25,745
if I put an arrow
through Loki's eye socket,

1535
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:28,581

I would like to wipe it out.

1546
01:35:26,472 --> 01:35:28,057

No.

For taking on Loki alone.

He was doing his job.

1555
01:35:47,493 --> 01:35:49,829
(SCOFFS) He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

on his hands that Loki does.

1564

we got to put that behind us

and get this done.

1566

If we can put together a list...

1568
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:15,521
He made it personal.

1569
01:36:15,855 --> 01:36:16,856
That's not the point.

1570
01:36:17,022 --> 01:36:19,442
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1571
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:21,318
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1572
01:36:21,694 --> 01:36:22,736
To tear us apart.

1573

Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1574
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:27,283
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

1575
01:36:27,366 --> 01:36:28,951
That's what he wants.

1576
01:36:29,034 --> 01:36:31,287
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

1577

He wants an audience.

This is opening night.

He wants flowers, he wants parades.
