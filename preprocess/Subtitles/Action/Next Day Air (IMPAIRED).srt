How come we ain't rob him?

370
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,272
'Cause he's my cousin, Guch.

So what he your cousin?
You robbed my cousin.

It was your idea to rob your fucking cousin.
Now, you're gonna...

You're supposed to have some ideas

00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,194
Shit, we ain't got to rob him now.
He'll buy all that shit.

(MOCKING) "If we were
you couldn't afford us."

752
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:26,438
Listen here, all right, with your flat asses.
I get the finger?

753
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,602
(MOCKING) Yeah.

754
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:34,046
Forget that girl. For real.

755
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:38,386
I don't even need her.
All I really need is my weed.

756
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:47,226
Yo!

757
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:51,028
I know I got a joint up in here somewhere.
Time to smoke a J.

758
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,002
I need to get my ass to Shelton Ave
and re-up.

759
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,609
SHAVOO: Since we're getting the cheese,
might as well get the compressor, too,

760
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,240
- while we in there.
- BUDDY: Shit, yeah.

761
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,113
SHAVOO: You know, I been thinking, man.

762
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:11,588
I've been thinking about
stopping this whole game, you know?

763
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:12,645
Calling it quits.

764
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,054
(LAUGHING) There you go.

765
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,390
No, I'm serious, man.
I know I done said it plenty of times before.

766
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:21,761
A million times I done said it,
but I'm for real this time. This is my stop.

767
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:24,027
You might as well flip one more
for the road.

768
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:29,505
No, man. Jones is a dead end.
I'm cool. I mean it.

769
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,837
I'm gonna cut through the grass, you know.

770
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:36,376
I'm gonna make my own path. I can't
tell you where I'm going to land but...

771
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,443
With 500 grand,

772
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:41,846
I'll be all right.

773
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,515
So, what's up? I mean,

774
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,086
you might as well come, too.

775
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,125
I ain't got enough to chill.

776
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,593
Chill don't pay the bills.

777
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:03,539
Well, sometimes, you gotta take a chance
with what you got, B.

778
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,669
You know, there was a time
big cat couldn't tell me shit either.

779
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:11,506
But look here, man, just promise me this.

780
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,212
Always remember what you're doing it for.

781
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,317
If it ain't worth dying for,

782
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,390
you don't wanna be in it.

783
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:26,453
I mean, in the end,
that's all that really matters.

784
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,656
Know what I mean?

785
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,230
Know mean.

786
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,263
SHAVOO: I feel like a free man already.

787
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:39,969
Shit.

788
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,276
Hey, Voo.

789
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:52,948
SHAVOO: Oh, shit.

790
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:57,821
All right, look, the first place

791
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,294
- we're gonna hit is the Ave.
- Okay.

792
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,263
Keep your eyes peeled
for a gray NDA truck.

793
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,800
And you know I don't like you coming
with me, so don't be wiling it out.

794
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,029
Yo, man. You act like I don't know
how to fucking act or something.

795
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:08,799
You don't, all right?
And if you ain't gonna listen to me,

796
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,340
then take your ass back up in the house.

797
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,602
Calm down.

798
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,512
(CLAMORING)

799
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:20,373
- Shit! Shit!
- Shut up, man.

800
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:21,543
- Why? Why?
- Calm down.

801
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,213
We gonna figure this shit out!
We gonna figure this shit out, man.

802
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,778
Now calm the fuck down.

803
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,689
- How much was here?
- A few hundred thou.

804
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,920
- A few hundred?
- Yeah.

805
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,429
- Shit, man.
- A few hundred.

806
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:37,159
I thought, all this time,
I just knew you had more than that.

807
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,395
- I don't, all right?
- Come here, Shavoo. Come here.

808
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,335
Man, what the fuck?

809
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:44,704
- Who all knew about this joint?
- Nobody but you.

810
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,267
Well, shit, you know I ain't take it.

811
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,001
Shit.

812
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,007
Don't you?

813
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,643
- Shav?
- Yeah, man. Look, man...

814
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,779
See! See! They got me thinking, man.
I trust you. You know that.

815
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,016
Hi, guys.

816
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,457
What the fuck you looking at?

817
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:05,620
Nobody, man. He work here.
Be cool. Be cool.

818
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:10,531
Yo, Shav, now, whoever came up in here,
they had a car,

819
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:15,432
because they took the compressor
and that's a heavy-ass motherfucker.

820
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,770
You ain't just walking up out here with that.

821
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,005
BUDDY: They rolled in here.

822
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,878
They put the compressor in the back
and they rolled out.

823
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:30,809
Yeah. Yeah. Let's get that ass.

824
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:41,056
What the fuck is you doing?

825
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,325
Me? I'm just...

826
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,401
- What the fuck is you doing?
- I'm just leaning on here.

827
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:49,030
You know? I'm just like, leaning. You know.

828
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,371
- Know mean?
- Know mean?

829
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,570
Get your punk ass in here, motherfucker.

830
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,714
BUDDY: You know Allah, motherfucker?

831
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,084
JESUS: God damn! Where the fuck you at?

832
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:08,249
Any other day, you see these motherfuckers
all over the place.

833
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,225
- Today, not one fucking truck.
<i>- Papi,</i> calm down.

834
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,921
I'm not used to seeing you bitch like this.

835
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,691
You'd be bitching, too,
if you knew what I know.

836
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:16,665
Know what, Jesús?
What are you talking about?

837
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,929
Okay. Remember Hector?

838
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,567
Yeah, that dude you used to work for.
What about him?

839
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:25,166
That's right.
One day he calls me up talking crazy,

840
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:26,368
<i>thanking me and shit.</i>

841
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,343
- Yo!
- Phew! Thank you, Jesus.

842
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,404
Yo, all the shit I gave you, go get it,
bring it to the spot right now.

843
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,780
(SCOFFS) Yo, dawg,
half that stuff is on the street, man.

844
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:37,218
No, I don't give a fuck where it's at.
Go get it, bring it to the spot right now.

845
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,277
Yo, what...

846
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,323
<i>(PHONE LINE DISCONNECTS)</i>

847
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,287
I get there, and this big motherfucker
answers the door.

848
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,163
BODEGA: Hey, look. Your friend is here.

849
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:03,207
- Is it all there?
- No. Not even half.

850
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,481
Your name is Jesús?

851
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,518
- Jesus.
- BODEGA: Jesus.

852
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:14,884
My name is Bodega Diablo.
This is my associate, Rhino.

853
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,017
I call him the Grim Reaper.

854
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,426
And you start lying to me,
you're gonna know why.

855
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:23,966
You know, it's funny,

856
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:25,592
just talking to your friend here
for a little while,

857
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:26,658
(GROANS)

858
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:29,433
It seems like I've known you all my life.

859
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:32,839
I know about your mother.
I even know about your father.

860
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,310
- Fuck. How?
- BODEGA: God bless his soul.

861
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,778
Now I...

862
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:42,115
No. You need to be straight up with me
right about now.

863
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,180
A couple of days ago,
I sent your friend here a package.

864
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:48,315
After a long talk,
he told me that he never got it.

865
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,292
- He says you have it.
- Me?

866
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,350
Shut the fuck up!

867
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,259
(MUFFLED MOANING)

868
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,854
Shut the fuck up!

869
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:57,798
Now where's my shit?

870
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,332
I almost shit on myself.

871
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:05,238
The last thing I wanted to do is to
tell this man that I don't have his shit.

872
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,641
Right, right. So what did you say?

873
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:11,203
I didn't bite my tongue like no bitch.
I told him the truth.

00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,581

It's cool with me man.
Whatever you say.

"...if you think I'm gonna work for a piece

Listen, we don't keep cash in the truck.

00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,802
You can just take this because it's all I got.

923

What the fuck is this? Huh?

Fake gold.

925
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:29,680

Take that shit. I'll rock it.

I like your outfit. You look very nice.
I like your shoes. I like your top.

946

Get your ass out of the truck. Now!

Turn the fuck around.

What the fuck is wrong with you?
"Nice outfit."

Damn that bitch is bad.

Oh, man, damn. Don't say that, man.

953
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:51,000

954
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,730
All right, man, I guess. All right. Go on.

That was Shavoo, man.
Something came up.

957
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,746
He said he ain't nothing gonna pop off
till the morning.

958
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,645
Oh! Ain't that a bitch?
See, that's what I'm talking about.

959
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:09,174
- What happened to that two hour shit?
- I don't know. Shit.

960
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,346
That's what I fucking mean, man.

961
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,254
I'm glad I didn't let the motherfuckers
take the package out of here.

962
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,189
Just be cool, man.
Everything will work out.

963
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,990
Ain't no "be cool" shit, man.
A lot could happen by tomorrow morning.

964
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,188
This motherfucker right here
might wake up.

965
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,596
BRODY: Please, he ain't waking up.

966
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:24,827
I think that motherfucker's
trying to set us up, man.

967
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:28,998
He's not gonna set us up, man.
It's my cousin. I keep telling you, man.

968
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:32,735
Now, look, if he said by tomorrow,
tomorrow it'll be. I know.

969
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:35,744
Okay, cool! What if he say two hours?
What do that mean?

That mean we celebrate, baby.
You know what I'm saying?

You know the little freak chick, Kira, right?

972
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:46,049
I'm gonna call her and a couple of her little
friends over, you know what I'm saying?

973
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:48,250
Have them come over tonight,

By tomorrow, we be ready, baby.

00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:54,162
We'll be busting four and five nuts,
we'll be ready to get that money, honey.

Hey, what's up? What y'all doing?

Hey, why don't you

and why don't y'all swing through here

983
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,215
and do something strange
for a little piece of change?

Look, I don't know
what you're talking about...

00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,294
- Yo, Shav. What you got there?
- Please...

988
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,889
Got some acetone.
"Extremely flammable liquid..."

Huh?

998
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:58,717
What would you say
if we took a helicopter ride to AC

999
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,285
and gambled a little bit?

I don't know what you're talking...
