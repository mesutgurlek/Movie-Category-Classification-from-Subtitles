1
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,016
Marcus.

2
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:08,437
How are you?

3
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:10,865
Ask me in an hour.

4
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:15,454
I thought I'd try...

5
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:17,616
one last time.

6
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:21,483
You should have stayed
in San Francisco, Dr. Kogan.

7
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:26,227
By signing
this consent form,

8
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:29,110
you'll be donating your body
to a noble cause.

9
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:30,892
You'd...

10
00:02:32,145 --> 00:02:34,003
have a second chance...

11
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,313
through my research
to live again.

12
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:39,200
You know
what I did.

13
00:02:40,414 --> 00:02:42,083
My brother and two cops
are dead

14
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,916
because of me.

15
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,311
I'm not lookin'
for a second chance.

16
00:02:50,982 --> 00:02:53,728
But I'm not the only one
with a death sentence, am I?

17
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:58,289
Do you think
I'm gonna kill your cancer

18
00:02:58,324 --> 00:02:59,045
this permanent?

19
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:03,219
I'm not worried
about myself.

20
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:08,034
I'm worried about
the future of the human race.

21
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,833
I'll sell it to you.

22
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:13,761
For what?

23
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:15,589
A kiss.

24
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:33,993
So that's what
death tastes like.

25
00:03:50,847 --> 00:03:53,006
You are doing something
very noble.

26
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:54,639
I'm guilty.

27
00:03:55,284 --> 00:03:57,030
Just cut me up
until there's nothing left.

28
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:05,563
That I walk through the valley
of the Shadow of Death.

29
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:07,499
I will fear no evil.

30
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:09,547
For thou art with me,

31
00:04:10,306 --> 00:04:13,759
thy rod and my staff,
they comfort me.

32
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:29,812
Do you have
any last words?

33
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:01,419
<i>Bag Art,
this is Black Hawk Six.</i>

34
00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:03,164
<i>Missile imbound to
Skynet target.</i>

35
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:06,247
<i>TTO 11 seconds,
taken close.</i>

36
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,621
- Come on, come on!
- Move, move!

37
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:41,651
- Help, go back!
- Right here!

38
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,336
<i>Connor is on the ground.</i>

39
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,003
This mission
is a quick in-and-out.

40
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:02,166
Command deems the information
on those computers

41
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,910
should be
at the highest priority.

42
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:37,668
Connor, there's no sign
of the machines.

43
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:38,239
They're gone.

44
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:40,022
Way too quiet.

45
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,139
It's almost like
they were waiting for us.

46
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:03,455
What the hell's
that smell, man?

47
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:06,751
Whoa!
You're seeing this?

48
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:32,682
Olson.
Objective located.

49
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:35,407
There's something else
you'd have to see.

50
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:55,698
We got what we came for,
Barbaros.

51
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:56,734
The clock's ticking.

52
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:58,309
Spread out,
secure the perimeter.

53
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:00,069
I got a big gap
over here.

54
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:01,650
Why didn't we know
about this?

55
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,206
Sir, I think this is
what Command's looking for.

56
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:06,435
I'm in
their source code.

57
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:09,152
These people are being taken
up north to San Francisco.

58
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:11,622
Some sort of R&D project,
for a new Terminator.

59
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,069
Send it to Command.

60
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,296
It's uploading,
I need two minutes.

61
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:17,801
Wait, wait, wait.
Go back. Go back!

62
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,369
Stop!

63
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:25,766
- T-800.
- A new Terminator.

64
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:29,142
Thought you said
it would be...

65
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,888
It's worse.

66
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:32,880
Connor, get your nose
out of that.

67
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:33,754
None of your business.

68
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:34,870
You're not
leading this mission.

69
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,208
Alright, let's cut
these sorry bastards loose.

70
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:38,128
Come on, let's go!

71
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:40,105
- Jericho, come in.
- What's that?

72
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:42,025
Come in, Jericho.

73
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:44,725
Connor,
get your ass top-side.

74
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,541
Remind those men
they need to answer me on the radio,

75
00:09:46,574 --> 00:09:47,458
even if they're dead.

76
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:49,132
Connor!

77
00:10:01,153 --> 00:10:02,737
<i>Connor,
get those men to respond.</i>

78
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,875
Olson,
something's wrong up here.

79
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:16,927
<i>Top-side, come in!</i>

80
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:22,674
Help out enemy aircraft,
I'm in pursuit.

81
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:26,883
There are human prisoners
aboard there.

82
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:27,704
Get after 'em!

83
00:10:44,152 --> 00:10:47,399
Data transferred to plane.
Connor, we're joining you, top--

84
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:27,369
<i>Bravo Ten, Bravo Ten.
Do you copy? Over.</i>

85
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:35,006
<i>Eagle White to Bravo Ten.
Bravo Ten, do you copy? Over.</i>

86
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:41,095
<i>Bravo Ten, Bravo Ten,
do you copy? Over.</i>

87
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:45,540
Here.

88
00:12:46,203 --> 00:12:47,647
<i>Bravo Ten, identify.
Over.</i>

89
00:12:49,153 --> 00:12:50,044
Connor!

90
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,041
<i>We'll send units
to the extraction point.</i>

91
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:53,734
<i>How many survivors
are outside? Over.</i>

92
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:55,322
One.

93
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:57,792
<i>Copy.</i>

94
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:02,568
Return to base, sir?

95
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:04,994
RGB?

96
00:14:05,298 --> 00:14:07,657
Negative.
Take me to Command.

97
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:08,607
Sir.

98
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:11,237
Command!

99
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:13,994
Roger, re-routing.

100
00:14:32,123 --> 00:14:33,703
Request
has been denied.

101
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:35,552
Command doesn't want
to give up their position.

102
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:36,711
Radio cogs, over.

103
00:14:36,836 --> 00:14:38,091
Are they down there?

104
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,882
Request
has been denied, sir.

105
00:14:39,915 --> 00:14:42,266
Need to go home.
It's straight from the top.

106
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:47,132
You open up that ramp!

107
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:48,795
And you tell them...

108
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:52,437
I need divers for a log-in.
Now!

109
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,686
This is crazy.

110
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:27,740
John Connor,
prophesied leader of the Resistance.

111
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,376
Soldier, you put every man
and woman in this sub

112
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,517
in jeopardy
with your little frogman stunt.

113
00:15:33,578 --> 00:15:35,158
What the hell
are you doing here?

114
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,355
What did we find
down there?

115
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:39,385
You'll be pleased down
the need-to-know basis.

116
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:42,805
<i>Well, I need to know,
because my men died</i>

117
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,030
down in that hole.

118
00:15:44,063 --> 00:15:45,572
What did we find
down there?

119
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:47,982
We found the solution,
Connor,

120
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:50,947
that can end this war,
once and for all.

121
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:56,293
We know the machines use
short-wave transmitters

122
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:57,268
to communicate.

123
00:15:58,137 --> 00:16:00,860
Our intel has located
a hidden signal

124
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,373
under
the primary channel.

125
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:06,116
It allows for direct control
over the machines.

126
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,584
Skynet's a machine,
and like all machines,

127
00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:10,430
it has an off-switch.

128
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:12,600
Does it work?

129
00:16:12,845 --> 00:16:14,491
Will it work?
Yes.

130
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,482
Have we field-tested it?
No.

131
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:21,823
Give it to me.
I'll do it.

132
00:16:22,736 --> 00:16:23,820
I'll test it.

133
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,456
Connor,
you can stay Comm unit.

134
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,798
Have a nice one record.

135
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,707
Alright.

136
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:33,644
Alright.

137
00:16:35,302 --> 00:16:36,708
Leave Connor in top-side.

138
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:38,107
Prepare for lock-out.

139
00:16:42,873 --> 00:16:44,470
Connor,
we do this right...

140
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,491
The war is over.

141
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,415
Remount our offensive
in 4 days.

142
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:53,386
Connor...

143
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:57,528
These are the codes
for the signal.

144
00:16:59,074 --> 00:16:59,809
Good luck.

145
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:01,242
Why four days?

146
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:04,221
A kill list was intercepted
from Skynet.

147
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:06,957
It says everyone in this room
will be dead by week's end.

148
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:09,240
You are number two
on the list.

149
00:17:11,102 --> 00:17:12,528
Well,
who's number one?

150
00:17:13,104 --> 00:17:14,751
I don't know.
A civilian.

151
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:16,807
Kyle. Reese.

152
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:55,730
Barnes...

153
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:02,030
My brother...
He didn't make it, did he?

154
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:52,529
<i>This is tape number 28.
It's Sarah Connor to my son, John.</i>

155
00:18:53,108 --> 00:18:54,429
<i>What's most difficult
for me</i>

156
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:56,261
<i>is trying to decide
what to tell you</i>

157
00:18:56,295 --> 00:18:57,432
<i>and what not to.</i>

158
00:18:57,894 --> 00:18:59,502
<i>Should I tell you
about your father?</i>

159
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:00,926
<i>Will it affect
your decision</i>

160
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,377
<i>to send him back in time
to protect me,</i>

161
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:05,510
<i>knowing that
he is your father?</i>

162
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:06,920
<i>And he'll be younger
than you,</i>

163
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:08,882
<i>only a teenager,
when you meet him.</i>

164
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:11,689
<i>Kyle. Person could go crazy
thinking about this.</i>

165
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,177
<i>But if you don't send Kyle,</i>

166
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,108
<i>you can never be
and Skynet will win the war.</i>

167
00:19:21,947 --> 00:19:23,041
You want
to talk about it?

168
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:27,349
Kyle is out there
somewhere alone

169
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:29,003
and Skynet
is hunting him.

170
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,720
What about the signal?

171
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:34,352
What do you think?

172
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:44,880
If it works,
it's incredible.

173
00:19:44,914 --> 00:19:45,583
Yeah.

174
00:19:45,862 --> 00:19:47,669
- We have to be careful.
- I agree.

175
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,694
But we have to try.

176
00:19:49,877 --> 00:19:50,599
Okay.

177
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:53,550
Alright then,
start with something small,

178
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:54,923
something
more familiar with.

179
00:19:58,245 --> 00:19:59,852
We should try
to capture a Hydrobot,

180
00:19:59,886 --> 00:20:01,006
bring it in for testing.

181
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:01,735
Yeah.

182
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,415
What is it, John?

183
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:11,139
Kill Kyle Reese,
reset the future.

184
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:13,557
No John Connor.

185
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,550
Hey!

186
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:36,009
Come with me
if you want to live.

187
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:39,846
What is that?

188
00:22:41,273 --> 00:22:43,262
She doesn't talk,
but you need to start.

189
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:45,864
Where did you
get that jacket?

190
00:22:46,604 --> 00:22:47,783
The other guy
didn't need it.

191
00:22:49,338 --> 00:22:52,350
You see that red?
It stands for blood.

192
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,101
It's a symbol
of the Resistance.

193
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:56,132
<i>You're obviously
not a Resistance fighter,</i>

194
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:57,075
so take it off.

195
00:22:58,925 --> 00:22:59,955
Take it off!

196
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:02,306
You point a gun
at someone,

197
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:04,420
you better be ready
to pull the trigger.

198
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,549
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

199
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,990
What the hell was
that thing?

200
00:23:14,024 --> 00:23:15,030
A Terminator.

201
00:23:15,612 --> 00:23:16,711
T-600.

202
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:24,497
What day is it?
What year?

203
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:28,359
2018.

204
00:23:31,516 --> 00:23:32,626
What happened here?

205
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:37,078
Judgement Day happened.

206
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:42,374
I gotta get outta here.

207
00:23:43,295 --> 00:23:45,797
You can't go on foot.
Machines will cut you down.

208
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:47,425
You need speed.

209
00:23:48,282 --> 00:23:49,163
I need a car.

210
00:23:49,783 --> 00:23:51,764
Look, there's some by
Griffith Observatory.

211
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:54,222
- I don't know now.
- Take me.

212
00:23:56,414 --> 00:23:57,393
Get down!

213
00:24:25,537 --> 00:24:27,166
That was
a Hunter Killer.

214
00:24:29,024 --> 00:24:30,705
Thanks to you,
they know we're here.

215
00:24:33,745 --> 00:24:34,672
What's your name,
kid?

216
00:24:36,136 --> 00:24:37,199
Kyle Reese.

217
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:42,187
Come on.

218
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:48,100
We burn down the transmitters
so it can't talk to any of its pals

219
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:49,969
that it can still recieve.

220
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,711
Turn it on!

221
00:24:54,315 --> 00:24:55,024
You got it?

222
00:24:55,837 --> 00:24:56,722
Hold it down!
Hold a bit...

223
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,370
Turn the signal up.

224
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,918
Get me a strap.

225
00:25:13,914 --> 00:25:16,043
- Holy shit.
- Could you believe it?

226
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:18,258
Just strap it tight.

227
00:25:18,522 --> 00:25:20,066
The signal
has to be continuous.

228
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:21,384
If there's
any interruption...

229
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,322
Let's rig up
a portable shortwave.

230
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:34,280
I need to test it on
something larger in the field.

231
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:34,901
Alright.

232
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,700
Destroy this thing.

233
00:25:49,787 --> 00:25:50,983
So where are the cars?

234
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:52,699
You don't want
to go out after dark.

235
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:54,941
Hunter Killers have infrared.

236
00:25:55,247 --> 00:25:56,418
Hunt better at night.

237
00:25:57,258 --> 00:25:58,887
We'll all go
tomorrow morning.

238
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:04,388
What is that?

239
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:06,389
Two-day old coyote.

240
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,067
Better than
three-day old coyote.

241
00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:22,302
Hey, hey!

242
00:26:27,924 --> 00:26:29,344
- Grab it.
- What?

243
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,350
Grab it.

244
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:41,682
Magic.

245
00:26:46,943 --> 00:26:48,165
- Got it?
- Yeah.

246
00:26:49,843 --> 00:26:50,569
Thanks.

247
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:56,265
This radio work?

248
00:26:57,307 --> 00:26:57,990
No.

249
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:01,302
My dad
tried to fix it, but...

250
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,262
He could never get it
to work.

251
00:27:19,191 --> 00:27:19,861
Hold that.

252
00:27:25,822 --> 00:27:27,039
Where is everybody?

253
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:28,532
They're gone.

254
00:27:30,071 --> 00:27:31,348
So why are you
still here?

255
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:34,288
'Cause we're the Resistance.
L.A. branch.

256
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,081
Welcome
to the headquarters.

257
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:38,945
Resistant to what?

258
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,503
Machines.
Skynet.

259
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,111
Just the two of you?

260
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:46,005
Yeah.

261
00:27:48,072 --> 00:27:49,511
How come you're not wearing
one of these?

262
00:27:50,926 --> 00:27:53,032
'Cause I haven't
earned mine, yet.

263
00:28:02,922 --> 00:28:04,520
I hope
he's listening to this.

264
00:28:08,023 --> 00:28:09,509
We've been fighting
a long time,

265
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:12,118
and we've all lost
so very much,

266
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:13,512
so many loved ones gone.

267
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,237
But you are
not alone.

268
00:28:16,157 --> 00:28:18,391
There are pockets of Resistance
all around the planet.

269
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:20,616
We are at the brink...

270
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:23,735
Do you want to see
a magic trick?

271
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:24,921
Hold that up.

272
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,287
Press the button.

273
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:38,121
<i>If we had to finally scope
when it is less than 100 meters.</i>

274
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:40,214
<i>We've had
a lot of firepower</i>

275
00:28:40,248 --> 00:28:41,810
<i>but the T-600's
are heavy,</i>

276
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:43,911
<i>and so,
their primitive design.</i>

277
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:44,995
Who is that?

278
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:46,284
<i>If you can help
or no...</i>

279
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,148
<i>- I don't know.
- then you have one option.</i>

280
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:49,956
Their motor cortex...

281
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:52,339
is partially exposed
to the back of their neck.

282
00:28:52,373 --> 00:28:52,845
A knife

283
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:55,127
<i>to this area will disorient
their tracking device</i>

284
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,112
<i>but not for long.</i>

285
00:28:57,008 --> 00:28:58,571
Above all,
stay alive.

286
00:28:58,711 --> 00:29:00,129
You have no idea...

287
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:01,459
<i>how important you are</i>

288
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,987
<i>and how important
you will become.</i>

289
00:29:04,471 --> 00:29:06,163
<i>The machines
are advancing even faster</i>

290
00:29:06,197 --> 00:29:07,431
<i>than I told you
they would.</i>

291
00:29:07,865 --> 00:29:09,313
<i>I've seen it
with my own eyes.</i>

292
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:11,124
<i>They were inventing
new Terminators.</i>

293
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,933
<i>New ways of killing us.</i>

294
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:15,346
<i>Skynet is planning
something big.</i>

295
00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:18,609
<i>But the Resistance
is planning something bigger.</i>

296
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:22,576
This is John Connor.

297
00:29:23,088 --> 00:29:24,371
<i>If you're
listening to this,</i>

298
00:29:25,308 --> 00:29:26,690
<i>you are
the Resistance.</i>

299
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,002
John Connor.

300
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:33,492
We gotta find
this guy.

301
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:06,937
So...
You get it working?

302
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:09,906
- Almost.
- Good.

303
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:13,382
Look, I figure
we head east, right?

304
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:14,345
We go
through the desert,

305
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,973
then we can connect
with the Resistance there.

306
00:30:17,624 --> 00:30:18,600
I'm heading north.

307
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:20,060
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

308
00:30:20,878 --> 00:30:23,052
The machines control
the whole Northern Sector

309
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:24,113
upto San Francisco.

310
00:30:24,146 --> 00:30:25,361
That's Skynet's central.

311
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:26,617
I have
to find someone.

312
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:28,201
There's a lot
that you don't understand

313
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:29,369
about Skynet, okay?

314
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:31,245
It's just too dangerous
for us to go there.

315
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:34,672
What about
the L.A. branch?

316
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:43,706
Come on, man.
We need to get out of L.A.

317
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,093
[ Song: Rooster
Band: Alice in Chains ]

318
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:05,256
What is that?

319
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:08,576
Something my brother
used to listen to.

320
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,147
Star, get out.

321
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:19,775
Don't look at me
like that, Star.

322
00:31:20,848 --> 00:31:22,439
Get out.
Get out!

323
00:31:25,435 --> 00:31:28,174
You're leaving?
You're gonna leave us?

324
00:31:30,718 --> 00:31:31,720
Ah, I get it.

325
00:31:34,538 --> 00:31:37,190
Do you want to know the difference
between us and the machines?

326
00:31:38,718 --> 00:31:40,527
We bury our dead.

327
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:44,498
But no one is coming
to bury you.

328
00:31:55,086 --> 00:31:55,935
Aerostat!

329
00:31:57,236 --> 00:31:59,468
- It's a scout of a Terminator.
- Go! Drive!

330
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:09,541
The Aerostat
heard the music.

331
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,688
Keep the steering.

332
00:32:13,722 --> 00:32:15,210
I've never driven
before.

333
00:32:18,741 --> 00:32:19,491
Hold the wheel.

334
00:32:26,884 --> 00:32:28,256
This thing
is pissing me of.

335
00:32:36,046 --> 00:32:36,770
Get it!

336
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:38,768
Hold on!

337
00:32:53,692 --> 00:32:55,315
If the idea
was to stay alive...

338
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:57,184
I'll drive.

339
00:33:01,475 --> 00:33:04,102
We're seeing a lot of
enemy movement in L.A.

340
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:06,633
Any of our people
in the area?

341
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,656
No one on the ground.
Two A-10s in the air.

342
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,205
Williams and Mirhadi.

343
00:33:11,565 --> 00:33:12,840
Send the birds down.

344
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:15,804
Guide them
to a safe area.

345
00:33:16,922 --> 00:33:18,807
<i>Roger, Coyote 6-7
in console.</i>

346
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,459
<i>Ten miles to bring.
Lima-Alpha, 1-2-5-7-9-0-3. Over.</i>

347
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:24,296
<i>- Copy that.
- Roger, Wild Eagle.</i>

348
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,288
<i>Final copy.</i>

349
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,970
Hey,
there's someone here.

350
00:34:24,885 --> 00:34:25,820
Get down, now!

351
00:34:26,182 --> 00:34:27,250
- Get down! Now!
- Move!

352
00:34:27,283 --> 00:34:28,660
- Drop your weapons.
- Let's see your hands!

353
00:34:28,724 --> 00:34:29,870
I never thought
that you guys--

354
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:31,243
- That's it, drop it!
- Move, man!

355
00:34:31,276 --> 00:34:31,947
What?

356
00:34:35,264 --> 00:34:36,113
Is there a problem?

357
00:34:36,337 --> 00:34:38,269
Hey, we saw
your Resistant sign.

358
00:34:38,303 --> 00:34:40,083
The old lady put it there,
not me.

359
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:42,085
What do you want?

360
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:43,636
We're looking
for fuel.

361
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,876
The dark season's coming.

362
00:34:46,691 --> 00:34:48,296
We only got enough
for ourselves.

363
00:34:48,842 --> 00:34:50,149
You point that gun
at somebody,

364
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:51,998
you better be ready
to pull the trigger.

365
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,094
Put your guns down,
everyone.

366
00:35:00,588 --> 00:35:02,454
Look, we just came
to find the Resistance.

367
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:03,145
That's all.

368
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:05,613
The Resistance?
What a joke.

369
00:35:06,393 --> 00:35:08,056
Fighting those machines
is impossible.

370
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:10,181
We keep our heads down,
they ignore us.

371
00:35:10,214 --> 00:35:12,330
You keep your heads down
and they'll come for you eventually.

372
00:35:12,364 --> 00:35:13,816
We help you
and maybe they will.

373
00:35:14,618 --> 00:35:16,035
These people
aren't gonna help you.

374
00:35:16,702 --> 00:35:17,313
Let's go.

375
00:35:17,313 --> 00:35:18,599
You're not going
anywhere.

376
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:21,532
Not until this one
gets something to eat.

377
00:35:31,622 --> 00:35:32,731
Bring me a basket.

378
00:35:34,956 --> 00:35:36,099
Here you go.

379
00:35:38,528 --> 00:35:41,097
Come on, help yourself!
Eat up.

380
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:51,403
Are you alright, son?

381
00:35:53,623 --> 00:35:54,652
It's our food.

382
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:56,395
Our fuel.

383
00:35:57,626 --> 00:35:59,186
It's not your choice
to make!

384
00:36:31,426 --> 00:36:32,828
- Are you okay?
- What?

385
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:34,083
Are you okay?

386
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:36,649
Star, Star!

387
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:39,098
Damn!
You brought them here!

388
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:40,034
You brought them here.

389
00:36:42,022 --> 00:36:42,835
Hey!

390
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:46,531
- Stop, stop!
- Come on, wait.

391
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,271
- Hey!
- Go! Go get 'em, go!

392
00:37:02,831 --> 00:37:04,517
- Head for the tunnels!
- Truck!

393
00:37:17,562 --> 00:37:18,809
Marcus, Marcus!

394
00:37:21,648 --> 00:37:22,779
We can't
just run for it.

395
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,533
Run!

396
00:38:09,726 --> 00:38:10,650
Shoot it!

397
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,771
Go, go, go!

398
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,063
It didn't work!

399
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:26,449
Shit!

400
00:38:58,278 --> 00:38:59,164
Hell, yeah!

401
00:39:16,677 --> 00:39:17,796
Mototerminators!

402
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:31,412
Shoot that
son of a bitch!

403
00:39:48,742 --> 00:39:50,062
Marcus,
turn right up here.

404
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,116
Hold on!

405
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:14,325
Where is the other one?

406
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:30,965
Get up here!

407
00:40:37,723 --> 00:40:38,693
Come on!

408
00:40:39,626 --> 00:40:40,817
Star,
give me the gun.

409
00:40:41,912 --> 00:40:42,577
I got it.

410
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:46,162
Yeah!

411
00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:57,034
Hang on!

412
00:41:04,847 --> 00:41:07,150
- Drop the ball!
- Uh, alright.

413
00:41:45,082 --> 00:41:46,338
Star, go!

414
00:41:53,486 --> 00:41:55,329
- Star!
- No!

415
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,774
Kyle!

416
00:42:35,293 --> 00:42:35,699
Marcus!

417
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:36,509
Get back!

418
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:44,344
Marcus! Marcus!

419
00:42:48,904 --> 00:42:50,234
<i>I got my eyes on
two targets.</i>

420
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,495
<i>We've got two bogeys
at 270º.</i>

421
00:42:53,116 --> 00:42:54,334
They've never come
this deep before.

422
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:55,324
They're looking
for something.

423
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,288
<i>H.K. is down.</i>

424
00:43:18,338 --> 00:43:20,144
<i>We've got an H.K.
porching our six.</i>

425
00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:22,253
<i>Come over by.
Breaking off.</i>

426
00:43:28,946 --> 00:43:30,822
Evasive maneuvers
now!

427
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:38,127
<i>Taking fire. I'm hit.
Portside damage.</i>

428
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:45,588
It's got a lock on you.
Break off.

429
00:43:48,322 --> 00:43:50,099
Eject, Williams, eject!

430
00:43:50,132 --> 00:43:51,137
<i>Punching out.</i>

431
00:44:08,457 --> 00:44:10,755
There's your transport,
headed northwest,

432
00:44:12,006 --> 00:44:14,644
bearing 2-8-9
towards San Francisco.

433
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:17,924
First,
test the signal...

434
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:20,467
and pray it works.

435
00:45:15,516 --> 00:45:16,183
You okay?

436
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:19,731
Get my knife.
It's in my left boot.

437
00:45:27,128 --> 00:45:27,903
What's your name?

438
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,870
Blair Williams.

439
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,201
What's yours?

440
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,831
Name's Marcus.

441
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:41,648
You can let me down now,
Marcus.

442
00:45:49,985 --> 00:45:52,749
- That thing, where'd it go?
- The transport?

443
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,248
Skynet.

444
00:45:54,894 --> 00:45:55,841
Where the hell
are you going?

445
00:45:56,283 --> 00:45:56,980
After it.

446
00:45:57,893 --> 00:45:59,310
Hate to break it
to you but...

447
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:01,378
If you've got friends
on that thing...

448
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:02,667
They're good as dead.

449
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:05,266
The same is you
if you keep walking in that direction.

450
00:46:05,457 --> 00:46:07,441
They've only been dead a while
and I am getting used to it.

451
00:46:08,306 --> 00:46:09,777
Why don't you come with me
to my base?

452
00:46:10,418 --> 00:46:11,654
Connor might know why.

453
00:46:15,863 --> 00:46:17,699
Listen, if you've got a problem
with the machines,

454
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,715
he's definitely the guy
you wanna talk to.

455
00:46:22,344 --> 00:46:24,727
- How far is your base?
- It should be 1 or 2 days hike.

456
00:46:26,145 --> 00:46:27,069
And it's that way.

457
00:46:51,285 --> 00:46:53,243
What are you saying?
Speak English!

458
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,222
I was telling him...

459
00:46:57,491 --> 00:47:00,408
It is not true,
the part the machines killing us.

460
00:47:00,714 --> 00:47:03,509
They're gonna kill us.
They're gonna kill everyone.

461
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,784
We are
in a cattle cart,

462
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:06,148
on our way
to the slaughterhouse.

463
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:08,947
Calm down.
You're not helping.

464
00:47:09,551 --> 00:47:12,355
The most important thing
that we can do right now

465
00:47:12,389 --> 00:47:13,668
is stay alive.

466
00:47:14,115 --> 00:47:15,926
In here
and in here.

467
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:19,758
Alright?
Just stay alive.

468
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:35,825
Over there.

469
00:47:42,921 --> 00:47:44,278
Find something
that can burn.

470
00:47:44,868 --> 00:47:46,148
We'll be
at my base tomorrow.

471
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:50,184
Are you hurt?

472
00:47:52,817 --> 00:47:53,693
I'm fine.

473
00:48:12,577 --> 00:48:13,973
What you got there?

474
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:18,825
Just some antibiotics.

475
00:48:19,573 --> 00:48:21,675
Antibiotics are hard
to come by these days.

476
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,150
Listen,
I don't have much, but...

477
00:48:24,184 --> 00:48:25,352
you're welcome
to whatever you need.

478
00:48:26,459 --> 00:48:27,836
We've been watching you.

479
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:30,760
Looking for this?

480
00:48:32,897 --> 00:48:35,486
Come on, guys.
Machines are the enemy.

481
00:48:35,802 --> 00:48:37,813
- We're on the same side.
- No, no.

482
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,381
See, I've got a couple of friends
on my side.

483
00:48:40,848 --> 00:48:42,513
Maybe they can
carry you home...

484
00:48:43,142 --> 00:48:44,300
when I'm done with you.

485
00:48:46,785 --> 00:48:48,444
You might want
a chamber around.

486
00:49:28,008 --> 00:49:29,642
Kill me,
you ain't gonna win this war.

487
00:49:34,612 --> 00:49:36,589
Ow! Oh, God!

488
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,004
I'm a little cold.

489
00:50:30,998 --> 00:50:32,045
Relax.

490
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:37,010
I just want
some body heat.

491
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,041
You have
a strong heart.

492
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:49,334
God,
I love that sound.

493
00:50:56,316 --> 00:50:57,283
Thank you...

494
00:50:58,272 --> 00:50:59,778
for saving me
back there.

495
00:51:01,273 --> 00:51:03,459
I don't meet a lot
of good guys these days.

496
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:06,833
I'm not
a good guy.

497
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:14,687
You are.

498
00:51:16,036 --> 00:51:17,558
You just
don't know it, yet.

499
00:51:26,702 --> 00:51:28,883
Do you think people
deserve a second chance?

500
00:51:32,684 --> 00:51:33,503
Yeah.

501
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:34,937
I do.

502
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:39,647
This is it.

503
00:51:39,892 --> 00:51:41,528
Skynet's Valley of Death.

504
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:43,394
We've never been
this deep before.

505
00:51:43,428 --> 00:51:44,668
We've got to be sure
this thing works

506
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:45,644
in their territory.

507
00:51:46,346 --> 00:51:47,545
On the bigger machines.

508
00:51:58,648 --> 00:51:59,619
That will bring them in.

509
00:52:16,543 --> 00:52:17,986
H.K.
They're coming.

510
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:39,932
Turn it up!

511
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:04,387
It works, man.
The signal works.

512
00:53:04,421 --> 00:53:05,391
It's beautiful!

513
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:19,410
<i>- Commander Ashdown.
- Connor, tell me it works.</i>

514
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:20,434
It works.

515
00:53:20,468 --> 00:53:22,463
That is affirmative.
The signal works.

516
00:53:22,896 --> 00:53:23,549
Good.

517
00:53:23,942 --> 00:53:26,641
The attack commences tomorrow
at 0400, worldwide.

518
00:53:26,675 --> 00:53:29,624
<i>Your unit will be in support
of a bombing in Skynet's central.</i>

519
00:53:29,975 --> 00:53:32,210
What is the extraction plan
for the prisoners?

520
00:53:32,244 --> 00:53:33,011
<i>Extraction plan?</i>

521
00:53:33,045 --> 00:53:34,621
<i>There is
no extraction plan.</i>

522
00:53:34,655 --> 00:53:35,822
We're gonna level
the place.

523
00:53:36,694 --> 00:53:38,605
Negative!
I told you.

524
00:53:39,096 --> 00:53:42,031
Skynet Central
is filled with human prisoners.

525
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:46,164
This is war, Connor.
Leadership has its cost.

526
00:53:46,198 --> 00:53:47,504
You, above all,
should know that.

527
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,665
Ashdown, come in.

528
00:53:52,807 --> 00:53:53,802
Ashdown, Connor.

529
00:53:54,613 --> 00:53:56,651
Ashdown, Con...
Damn him!

530
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,147
Star! Get back!
Get back!

531
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,067
You have
to calm down, now.

532
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,481
I gotta get
out of here!

533
00:54:53,507 --> 00:54:54,176
Blair.

534
00:54:54,732 --> 00:54:55,429
What?

535
00:54:58,954 --> 00:55:01,520
This is us.
The mines are magnetic.

536
00:55:02,152 --> 00:55:03,637
If we head due west
at this point of entry,

537
00:55:03,671 --> 00:55:04,455
we're good.

538
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:08,292
I'll go first.

539
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,693
Let's go, Marcus.
I'm starving.

540
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:49,045
<i>For thou art with me,</i>

541
00:55:49,785 --> 00:55:52,048
<i>thy rod and my staff,</i>

542
00:55:52,273 --> 00:55:53,723
- they comfort me.
- Father.

543
00:55:56,509 --> 00:55:58,941
<i>This is the beginning</i>

544
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,905
of something
wonderful.

545
00:56:02,868 --> 00:56:04,916
- The son of a bitch is here.
- What do we've got here?

546
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:06,269
He stepped
on a landmine.

547
00:56:06,398 --> 00:56:08,001
Start a large four IV.

548
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:09,224
Keep it open.

549
00:56:09,268 --> 00:56:10,423
- I'm okay.
- Patient needs more morphine.

550
00:56:10,456 --> 00:56:12,215
- What's his name?
- Marcus.

551
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:16,248
He's got
a prosthetic limb?

552
00:56:16,644 --> 00:56:17,374
What?

553
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:19,760
Okay,
pulse is dead.

554
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,006
Let's see
what we've got here.

555
00:56:27,018 --> 00:56:27,939
Barnes?

556
00:56:33,749 --> 00:56:35,647
<i>The Devil's hands
have been busy.</i>

557
00:56:38,298 --> 00:56:41,053
- What is it?
- It's real flesh and blood.

558
00:56:41,505 --> 00:56:43,297
Though it seems
to heal his off quickly.

559
00:56:44,003 --> 00:56:47,854
The heart is human,
but very powerful.

560
00:56:48,259 --> 00:56:50,523
The brain too,
but with a chip interface.

561
00:56:50,612 --> 00:56:53,398
- He done enough?
- It has a hybrid nervous system.

562
00:56:53,834 --> 00:56:55,671
One human cortex.

563
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,210
- One machine.
- What the hell would have they done?

564
00:56:59,704 --> 00:57:00,788
Who built you?

565
00:57:02,274 --> 00:57:05,308
My name is
Marcus Wright.

566
00:57:06,484 --> 00:57:07,806
You think
you're human?

567
00:57:08,755 --> 00:57:09,757
I am human.

568
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:36,886
No!

569
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:40,558
No! God!

570
00:57:43,234 --> 00:57:44,735
Where were you
manufactured?

571
00:57:45,868 --> 00:57:46,789
I was born...

572
00:57:48,348 --> 00:57:50,803
August 22nd, 1975.

573
00:58:02,183 --> 00:58:03,193
I know you.

574
00:58:04,578 --> 00:58:06,641
I heard your voice
on the radio.

575
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:10,637
- You're John Connor.
- Of course you know me.

576
00:58:12,331 --> 00:58:13,923
You were sent here
to kill me.

577
00:58:15,061 --> 00:58:16,314
Kill the leadership.

578
00:58:17,187 --> 00:58:18,952
I don't know
what you're talking about.

579
00:58:19,045 --> 00:58:19,993
Then why are you here?

580
00:58:20,146 --> 00:58:22,382
Blair said you could help me
find who I'm looking for.

581
00:58:26,404 --> 00:58:27,542
Now let me down.

582
00:58:28,262 --> 00:58:29,741
If I let you down...

583
00:58:30,999 --> 00:58:32,551
you'll kill everyone
in this room.

584
00:58:33,351 --> 00:58:34,634
Just you, Connor.

585
00:58:35,594 --> 00:58:37,132
'Cause I ain't
give a shit about you.

586
00:58:37,883 --> 00:58:40,100
I didn't even know your name
until two days ago.

587
00:58:40,134 --> 00:58:40,753
No?

588
00:58:45,153 --> 00:58:45,969
You and me...

589
00:58:47,575 --> 00:58:48,775
We've been at war,

590
00:58:49,837 --> 00:58:51,858
since before
either of us even existed.

591
00:58:53,771 --> 00:58:56,855
You tried killing my mother,
Sarah Connor.

592
00:58:58,045 --> 00:59:00,761
You killed my father,
Kyle Reese.

593
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,056
You will not
kill me.

594
00:59:05,782 --> 00:59:10,490
Kyle Reese is on a Transporter,
heading for Skynet.

595
00:59:11,738 --> 00:59:13,459
If I wanted
to kill him,

596
00:59:14,658 --> 00:59:16,108
I would have done him
in L.A.

597
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,863
Where did you
find that thing?

598
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:27,123
You sent Mihradi and me
to provide cover for some civilians.

599
00:59:27,157 --> 00:59:28,055
He was
one of them.

600
00:59:28,764 --> 00:59:29,947
Was there
a teenage boy?

601
00:59:30,581 --> 00:59:31,948
I honestly don't know.

602
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:33,290
They were taking him
to a Transport.

603
00:59:33,324 --> 00:59:36,454
<i>- He was the only one left.
- Not he, Blair. It.</i>

604
00:59:37,014 --> 00:59:38,836
<i>"It was the only one left."
Don't be naïve.</i>

605
00:59:39,603 --> 00:59:41,029
It saved my life.

606
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,118
Kate, what's gonna
happen to him?

607
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:48,696
Disassembled.

608
00:59:49,707 --> 00:59:50,767
You mean killed.

609
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:53,273
It may have information
on Skynet.

610
00:59:55,237 --> 00:59:56,988
I know
he's not the enemy.

611
00:59:57,394 --> 00:59:58,849
I've been shot at
by the enemy.

612
00:59:58,882 --> 00:59:59,809
That's not him.

613
00:59:59,842 --> 01:00:02,748
That machine saved you
only to gain access

614
01:00:02,782 --> 01:00:03,888
to kill all of us.

615
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:44,439
We're gonna be okay.
Don't worry.

616
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:02,480
For my brother.

617
01:01:13,175 --> 01:01:15,810
No!

618
01:01:21,341 --> 01:01:22,517
Connor wants
to see you.

619
01:01:23,578 --> 01:01:24,392
What for?

620
01:01:25,232 --> 01:01:26,991
Like he's going to tell me,
Barnes.

621
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,572
Let me see that.

622
01:01:37,847 --> 01:01:39,430
You want me to tell Connor
you're not coming?

623
01:01:39,463 --> 01:01:40,211
No.

624
01:01:45,214 --> 01:01:46,082
Watch him.

625
01:02:13,082 --> 01:02:15,179
<i>I told you everything
I know, John.</i>

626
01:02:15,663 --> 01:02:18,539
<i>Skynet is ruthless
and unpredictable.</i>

627
01:02:18,572 --> 01:02:21,740
<i>They will use the best part of you
against yourself,</i>

628
01:02:22,272 --> 01:02:25,280
<i>and they will have methods
I can't imagine or predict.</i>

629
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,381
<i>That I can't
help you with.</i>

630
01:02:27,975 --> 01:02:29,412
<i>And when
you're unsure,</i>

631
01:02:30,221 --> 01:02:32,535
<i>which just always
follow your heart, John.</i>

632
01:02:33,258 --> 01:02:35,588
<i>I love you.
Goodbye.</i>

633
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,318
There's nothing on the tapes
about machines with organs.

634
01:02:40,622 --> 01:02:41,928
That thing in there...

635
01:02:45,055 --> 01:02:46,483
I thought I knew
our enemy.

636
01:02:47,231 --> 01:02:48,308
But that thing...

637
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:50,690
That makes me feel like
I know nothing.

638
01:02:52,823 --> 01:02:55,372
I looked in its eyes,
and it believes,

639
01:02:55,784 --> 01:02:58,188
absolutely believes,
that it is human.

640
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:01,856
<i>It believes everything
that it says,</i>

641
01:03:01,889 --> 01:03:05,885
and it is telling me
that Kyle Reese is in Skynet.

642
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,546
If that is true...

643
01:03:09,096 --> 01:03:12,357
The Command is about
to bomb my father

644
01:03:12,546 --> 01:03:16,202
and the rest of those prisoners
and I cannot stop them.

645
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,213
Thank you.

646
01:03:25,924 --> 01:03:26,696
Come in!

647
01:03:29,422 --> 01:03:31,523
Wassup?
Blair says you needed me.

648
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:52,621
Get in!

649
01:03:54,749 --> 01:03:55,521
Kill them!

650
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:05,212
Barnes!
What about Blair?

651
01:04:05,706 --> 01:04:07,192
She made her choice.

652
01:04:07,225 --> 01:04:08,012
Get down!

653
01:04:20,337 --> 01:04:21,115
Let's move.

654
01:04:33,313 --> 01:04:35,654
- Put some light out there!
- We're back in the minefield.

655
01:04:36,128 --> 01:04:36,972
I have a plan.

656
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:02,450
- Blair, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay!

657
01:05:02,483 --> 01:05:04,555
- Get your team back!
- There they are!

658
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:06,575
Run! God--

659
01:05:17,534 --> 01:05:18,425
Now what?

660
01:05:19,592 --> 01:05:21,062
M-My plan stopped
at the jeep.

661
01:05:21,525 --> 01:05:22,324
Okay.

662
01:05:23,537 --> 01:05:24,839
Do you have
the shot?

663
01:05:32,133 --> 01:05:34,974
I'll draw the fire.
You take out the light.

664
01:05:43,513 --> 01:05:44,894
I got a target!

665
01:05:47,913 --> 01:05:48,593
Behind the wall.

666
01:05:49,138 --> 01:05:50,111
- Don't move.
- Go!

667
01:05:50,608 --> 01:05:51,565
Down!

668
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:52,593
Keep your head down!

669
01:05:52,627 --> 01:05:55,287
Keep your head down!
Go, go, go, go!

670
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:03,773
Come on!

671
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:12,479
- You alright?
- Let's get you out of here.

672
01:06:18,446 --> 01:06:19,282
There they are!

673
01:06:37,238 --> 01:06:39,231
On the ground!
Stay on the ground!

674
01:06:39,264 --> 01:06:40,279
<i>Report 47.</i>

675
01:06:42,092 --> 01:06:43,194
<i>Coming straight down.
I'm going in.</i>

676
01:06:43,227 --> 01:06:45,121
- Do not move!
- Keep your eye on them.

677
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:46,713
Who's there?

678
01:07:27,371 --> 01:07:30,686
<i>Alligator, this is Scarface 5-1,
we have eyes on the machine.</i>

679
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,705
<i>Contact--</i>

680
01:07:45,648 --> 01:07:46,779
Take my gun!

681
01:08:19,134 --> 01:08:20,058
<i>Check the river.</i>

682
01:08:35,627 --> 01:08:36,435
You see him?

683
01:08:40,845 --> 01:08:41,610
Move!

684
01:08:50,053 --> 01:08:50,806
God!

685
01:09:02,323 --> 01:09:03,710
I'm going down!

686
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:13,544
Fall!

687
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:17,493
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

688
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,557
They know what you are,
even if you don't.

689
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:07,411
Enough!

690
01:10:08,553 --> 01:10:09,845
That gun ain't
gonna stop shit!

691
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:11,066
Nobody shot you
in the heart,

692
01:10:11,099 --> 01:10:12,957
and I see that thing
beating a mile a minute.

693
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,967
Kyle Reese...

694
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:17,146
He's in Skynet.
You do that, he's dead.

695
01:10:18,386 --> 01:10:19,587
I can get you in.

696
01:10:21,604 --> 01:10:22,291
How?

697
01:10:28,987 --> 01:10:30,009
Look at me.

698
01:10:32,222 --> 01:10:33,854
That's why
I don't trust you.

699
01:10:36,228 --> 01:10:37,841
I'm your only hope
you have.

700
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:43,872
I need to find
who did this to me.

701
01:10:46,089 --> 01:10:47,064
So do you.

702
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:49,161
Connor!

703
01:10:55,939 --> 01:10:56,980
Make your choice.

704
01:10:59,092 --> 01:11:00,017
You kept being...

705
01:11:03,169 --> 01:11:06,709
You tell me
where I can find Kyle Reese.

706
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:11,683
- Yeah?
- I will.

707
01:11:17,997 --> 01:11:19,189
Contact me on that.

708
01:11:20,301 --> 01:11:21,626
Let me know
he's still alive.

709
01:11:27,768 --> 01:11:28,872
What are you?

710
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:30,740
I don't know.

711
01:11:38,087 --> 01:11:39,310
Hey,
he's over here.

712
01:11:39,343 --> 01:11:40,291
Where is he heading?

713
01:11:42,794 --> 01:11:43,615
You alright?

714
01:11:45,412 --> 01:11:46,453
Any sign of him?

715
01:11:48,172 --> 01:11:48,901
He's gone.

716
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:57,894
What'd you do?

717
01:11:59,783 --> 01:12:02,819
I saw a man,
not a machine.

718
01:12:11,181 --> 01:12:12,199
How's your leg?

719
01:12:13,027 --> 01:12:13,998
I'll live.

720
01:12:14,716 --> 01:12:15,487
Let her go!

721
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:25,571
Connor.

722
01:12:26,436 --> 01:12:27,124
Command for you.

723
01:12:28,854 --> 01:12:29,806
This is Connor.

724
01:12:29,914 --> 01:12:31,329
Connor,
are your men ready?

725
01:12:31,539 --> 01:12:33,768
<i>Negative.
Nobody is ready.</i>

726
01:12:33,802 --> 01:12:35,296
We are not,
you are not.

727
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:38,366
We must abort the attack.
The game has changed.

728
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,639
What are you talking about?

729
01:12:39,673 --> 01:12:41,694
All our elements
are past the release points.

730
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,513
They are in
assault position.

731
01:12:43,547 --> 01:12:46,617
Then delay the attack.
At least, delay the attack.

732
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:48,336
I have a chance
to infiltrate Skynet

733
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:49,753
and rescue
those prisoners.

734
01:12:49,787 --> 01:12:50,898
Give me
that opportunity.

735
01:12:50,932 --> 01:12:52,138
No, absolutely not.

736
01:12:52,356 --> 01:12:54,357
This is not the time
for a rescue mission.

737
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:57,160
What you ask for,
will undermine the whole operation.

738
01:12:57,194 --> 01:12:59,486
Skynet has Kyle Reese.

739
01:13:00,116 --> 01:13:01,305
And that is his fate.

740
01:13:01,338 --> 01:13:02,522
<i>No, it's our fate.</i>

741
01:13:02,555 --> 01:13:05,442
I have to save him.
He is the key.

742
01:13:05,476 --> 01:13:07,791
The key to the future,
to the past.

743
01:13:07,924 --> 01:13:10,567
Without him,
we lose everything.

744
01:13:10,601 --> 01:13:12,040
No!
You stay the course!

745
01:13:12,284 --> 01:13:15,044
If we stay the course,
we are dead!

746
01:13:15,326 --> 01:13:16,932
We are all dead!

747
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:19,588
<i>As of this moment,
soldier,</i>

748
01:13:19,621 --> 01:13:21,317
you are relieved
to your command.

749
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:24,239
You are no longer
a part of this Resistance.

750
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:33,443
I didn't catch
that last statement.

751
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:35,130
Neither did I.

752
01:13:38,854 --> 01:13:39,695
This is John Connor.

753
01:13:39,856 --> 01:13:41,063
If you're listening
to this,

754
01:13:41,188 --> 01:13:42,802
you are
the Resistance.

755
01:13:43,977 --> 01:13:45,161
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

756
01:13:45,356 --> 01:13:46,649
<i>If we attack tonight,</i>

757
01:13:47,346 --> 01:13:49,232
<i>our humanity is lost.</i>

758
01:13:50,712 --> 01:13:52,629
Command wants us
to fight like machines,

759
01:13:52,664 --> 01:13:55,276
they want us to make
cold, calculated decisions.

760
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:57,549
But we are not
machines.

761
01:13:58,076 --> 01:14:00,740
And if we behave like them,
then what is the point...

762
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:01,842
in winning?

763
01:14:03,407 --> 01:14:07,203
<i>Command is going to ask you
to attack Skynet.</i>

764
01:14:08,045 --> 01:14:09,687
<i>I am asking you
not to.</i>

765
01:14:12,945 --> 01:14:17,006
If even one bomb
drops on Skynet before sunrise,

766
01:14:17,226 --> 01:14:19,979
our future will be lost.

767
01:14:20,693 --> 01:14:22,895
<i>So, please.
Stand down.</i>

768
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:24,392
<i>Give me the time</i>

769
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,244
<i>to protect our future,
that all of us,</i>

770
01:14:27,893 --> 01:14:29,355
<i>are fighting for.</i>

771
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:33,362
This is
John Connor.

772
01:14:50,532 --> 01:14:51,196
Thank you.

773
01:14:56,916 --> 01:14:59,512
What should I tell your men
when they find out you're gone?

774
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:04,854
I'll be back.

Come on, Marcus.

778
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:50,237
Okay.

779
01:20:24,290 --> 01:20:26,627
Signal broadcasted
with full thrift, sir.

780
01:20:26,661 --> 01:20:27,661
Good.

781
01:20:28,109 --> 01:20:29,687
Commence
bombing of Skynet.

782
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,233
We have a green light
for the attack.

783
01:20:31,781 --> 01:20:32,929
<i>This is Bakersfield.</i>

<i>This is Reno.

Eugene, Reno, Bakersfield,
they're all standing down.

789
01:20:40,433 --> 01:20:43,245
They will not attack,
unless Connor gives the order.

790
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:11,112
Kyle Reese?

791

<i>Oh, and you executed
that programming beautifully.</i>

<i>We've been at war since before
either of us even existed.</i>

816
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:44,234
<i>You tried killing my mother,
Sarah Connor.</i>

817
01:22:44,874 --> 01:22:45,628
<i>You kept being...</i>

818
01:22:46,986 --> 01:22:49,489
<i>You tell me
where I can find Kyle Reese.</i>

819
01:22:49,961 --> 01:22:51,972
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

820
01:22:55,296 --> 01:22:57,411
Kyle Reese!
Kyle Reese!

821
01:22:57,445 --> 01:22:58,833
Move! Move!

822
01:22:59,629 --> 01:23:00,527
Kyle Reese!

823
01:23:01,806 --> 01:23:03,232
Get to your transport.

824
01:23:03,819 --> 01:23:04,634
Kyle Reese!

825
01:23:11,418 --> 01:23:13,131
You, move!

826
01:23:13,958 --> 01:23:15,505
<i>In times of desperation,</i>

827
01:23:15,539 --> 01:23:17,684
<i>people will believe
what they want to believe.</i>

828
01:23:18,018 --> 01:23:21,976
<i>And so, we gave them
what they wanted to believe.</i>

829
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,062
<i>A trick,
in the form of a signal,</i>

830
01:23:24,095 --> 01:23:26,078
<i>the Resistance thought
would win the war.</i>

831
01:23:26,111 --> 01:23:28,327
<i>And they were right,
it will end this war.</i>

832
01:23:28,641 --> 01:23:31,787
<i>Except that it is the Resistance
that will be terminated,</i>

833
01:23:32,514 --> 01:23:33,674
<i>not Skynet.</i>

834
01:23:40,521 --> 01:23:43,231
Get the attack through
Skynet's Central back online.

835
01:23:43,321 --> 01:23:46,022
I want our aircraft in the sky,
immediately!

836
01:23:46,259 --> 01:23:49,203
Sir, sir, we got a bogey
with a very large radar signature,

837
01:23:49,237 --> 01:23:50,457
closing in
on our position.

838
01:24:01,512 --> 01:24:02,383
Losenko?

839
01:24:07,827 --> 01:24:09,826
We have destroyed
ourselves.

840
01:24:10,667 --> 01:24:12,510
Skynet tracked
our signal.

841
01:24:12,543 --> 01:24:14,064
We led them
straight to us.

842
01:24:26,883 --> 01:24:28,912
<i>Our best machines have failed,
time and again,</i>

843
01:24:28,945 --> 01:24:30,095
<i>to complete a mission.</i>

844
01:24:30,681 --> 01:24:31,866
<i>Something was missing.</i>

845
01:24:32,107 --> 01:24:34,438
<i>We had to think,
radically.</i>

846
01:24:34,866 --> 01:24:36,243
<i>And so we made you.</i>

847
01:24:36,564 --> 01:24:39,496
<i>We created the perfect
infiltration machine.</i>

848
01:24:40,614 --> 01:24:41,816
<i>You, Marcus.</i>

849
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:45,793
<i>You did what Skynet
has failed to do for so many years.</i>

850
01:24:46,709 --> 01:24:48,328
<i>You killed John Connor.</i>

851
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:48,141
Kyle!

852
01:25:48,938 --> 01:25:49,883
Hey!

853
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:00,739
<i>Don't fight, Marcus.</i>

854
01:26:01,772 --> 01:26:03,493
<i>Remember
what you are.</i>

855
01:26:04,545 --> 01:26:05,856
I know what I am.

856
01:26:18,868 --> 01:26:20,113
I'm better this way.

857
01:26:20,344 --> 01:26:22,598
<i>You will not be given
a second chance.</i>

858
01:26:23,327 --> 01:26:25,283
<i>You cannot save
John Connor.</i>

859
01:26:26,138 --> 01:26:27,040
Watch me.

860
01:26:55,736 --> 01:26:57,393
We got a message
from Connor!

861
01:26:57,837 --> 01:26:59,638
He's in Skynet.
Needs air support.

862
01:27:02,095 --> 01:27:04,297
Let's go!
Scram for the aircraft.

863
01:27:07,651 --> 01:27:09,934
Star!
Star, go!

864
01:27:18,072 --> 01:27:20,416
Star! Star!

865
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:22,798
Star! Go back!
Come on!

866
01:27:22,832 --> 01:27:24,689
<i>Come on.
Come on.</i>

867
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:44,189
What's your name?

868
01:27:44,705 --> 01:27:45,740
Kyle Reese.

869
01:27:51,285 --> 01:27:52,166
Stay with me!

870
01:28:12,147 --> 01:28:12,800
Back!

871
01:28:16,874 --> 01:28:17,689
Get back!

872
01:28:27,618 --> 01:28:28,925
Come on, Star,
move!

873
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:29,536
Move!

874
01:28:56,443 --> 01:28:57,653
T-800s.

875
01:28:58,871 --> 01:29:00,274
There's so
many of them.

876
01:29:19,468 --> 01:29:20,187
Be careful!

877
01:29:24,955 --> 01:29:27,321
- What are these?
- Fuel cells.

878
01:29:27,847 --> 01:29:29,511
Life source
for the T-800.

879
01:29:32,628 --> 01:29:33,591
Nuclear.

880
01:29:34,885 --> 01:29:36,486
Enough
to level this place.

881
01:29:38,728 --> 01:29:39,656
Cover us.

882
01:29:40,877 --> 01:29:41,601
Get ready.

883
01:30:11,361 --> 01:30:12,419
Run!

884
01:30:13,656 --> 01:30:14,888
Star, come on!
Let's go!

885
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:17,793
Come here!

886
01:30:21,407 --> 01:30:22,380
- Come on!
- Come on!

887
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:27,904
We got to get
to the transport!

888
01:30:33,659 --> 01:30:34,582
Where are you going?

889
01:30:34,615 --> 01:30:36,129
- I gotta end this.
- No, no!

890
01:30:36,157 --> 01:30:37,207
I'm not gonna
leave you!

891
01:30:37,688 --> 01:30:40,140
- You didn't.
- Who are you?

892
01:30:40,919 --> 01:30:42,155
John Connor!

893
01:33:36,263 --> 01:33:38,346
- Hang back now!
- Hey!

894
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:39,914
Hey, John Connor's
in there.

895
01:33:40,038 --> 01:33:40,520
Where?

896
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:41,687
- You show me there.
- Hey, hey!

897
01:33:43,274 --> 01:33:43,798
What?

898
01:33:43,826 --> 01:33:45,185
John Connor's
in there.

899
01:33:46,134 --> 01:33:47,006
Come with me!

900
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,007
Connor!

901
01:34:10,125 --> 01:34:11,362
I need help!

902
01:34:12,821 --> 01:34:13,660
Help!

903
01:34:15,379 --> 01:34:17,064
Connor, it's Kyle!
Help!

904
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:17,000
You son of a bitch!

905
01:35:44,146 --> 01:35:45,390
Come on!

906
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:51,600
Come on!

907
01:36:09,891 --> 01:36:11,195
Come on!

908
01:36:59,932 --> 01:37:01,082
Let's get
out of here.

909
01:37:18,469 --> 01:37:19,570
John...

910
01:37:24,388 --> 01:37:26,213
We can't make it
back to base.

911
01:37:26,241 --> 01:37:28,178
Center's down
and they never say so.

912
01:37:34,942 --> 01:37:37,689
<i>Medevac, urgent.
Severe chest trauma.</i>

913
01:37:38,176 --> 01:37:39,689
<i>Call the surgical team.</i>

914
01:37:40,032 --> 01:37:41,880
<i>We're locked.
It's Connor.</i>

915
01:38:58,046 --> 01:38:59,081
How long?

916
01:39:02,787 --> 01:39:05,319
His heart...

917
01:39:06,638 --> 01:39:07,565
can't take it.

918
01:39:07,594 --> 01:39:09,002
He's going to be okay.

919
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:11,648
He's going
to be okay, Kate.

920
01:39:11,649 --> 01:39:12,442
Kyle?

921
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:26,525
Take it...

922
01:39:45,706 --> 01:39:46,838
You earned it.

923
01:40:05,585 --> 01:40:06,264
Kate...

924
01:40:12,708 --> 01:40:13,577
Take mine.

925
01:40:15,202 --> 01:40:16,221
Marcus?

926
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:22,217
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

927
01:40:25,801 --> 01:40:26,821
This is mine.

928
01:41:22,411 --> 01:41:24,096
<i>What is it
that makes us human?</i>

929
01:41:26,505 --> 01:41:28,385
<i>It's not something
you can program.</i>

930
01:41:30,705 --> 01:41:32,431
<i>You can't put it
into a chip.</i>

931
01:41:34,562 --> 01:41:36,537
<i>It's the strength
of the human heart.</i>

932
01:41:37,823 --> 01:41:41,081
<i>The difference
between us and machines.</i>

933
01:41:59,885 --> 01:42:01,540
<i>There is a storm
on the horizon.</i>

934
01:42:02,019 --> 01:42:03,661
<i>A time of hardship
and pain.</i>

935
01:42:05,019 --> 01:42:06,349
<i>This battle
has been won,</i>

936
01:42:06,383 --> 01:42:09,325
<i>but the war against
the machines races on.</i>

937
01:42:09,932 --> 01:42:16,039
<i>Skynet's global network remains strong,
but we will not quit,</i>

938
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:17,957
<i>until all of it is destroyed.</i>

939
01:42:18,180 --> 01:42:22,753
<i>This is John Connor.
There is no fate, but what we make</i>
