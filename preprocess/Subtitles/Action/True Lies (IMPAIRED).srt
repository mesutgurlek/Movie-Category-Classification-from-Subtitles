formatted for the 1720.

666
00:47:05,808 --> 00:47:08,744
So I have to go back
upstairs and reformat,

667
00:47:08,811 --> 00:47:10,746
Go back downstairs
and use the printer,

668
00:47:10,813 --> 00:47:14,916
Then I couldn't get
my car to start.

669
00:47:14,984 --> 00:47:18,120
Then traffic...Well,
I barely got there.

670
00:47:20,823 --> 00:47:22,190
That's a little excitement

671
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:24,192
In an otherwise dull day.

672
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,161
Did it work out O.K.?

673
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:28,997
Yeah.

674
00:47:29,065 --> 00:47:30,232
Great.

675
00:47:31,567 --> 00:47:33,068
I'll check on dessert.

676
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,203
I'm done.

677
00:47:40,643 --> 00:47:42,110
The great thing is,

678
00:47:42,178 --> 00:47:45,113
They're practically giving us
a blank check on wiretap.

679
00:47:45,181 --> 00:47:49,084
I've set them up on all
of Juno's shipping agents
and her clients.

680
00:47:49,152 --> 00:47:53,088
Faisal's made a list
of possible U.S. Contacts
of the Crimson Jihad.

681
00:47:53,156 --> 00:47:55,290
Now we can just
sit around--

682
00:47:57,727 --> 00:48:00,162
Hey, this national security
stuff boring you?

683
00:48:00,229 --> 00:48:02,664
Put a tap on her phone.

684
00:48:02,732 --> 00:48:05,133
What do you mean?
I already did that.

685
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:06,635
I'm talking about Helen's.

686
00:48:06,702 --> 00:48:10,138
Put a tap on her office line
and my house. Do it now.

687
00:48:10,206 --> 00:48:11,940
Just come over here.
Sounds great.

688
00:48:12,008 --> 00:48:15,944
I have a question.
I got two words to
describe that idea--

689
00:48:16,012 --> 00:48:18,613
In-sane. An unauthorized
wiretap is a felony.

690
00:48:18,681 --> 00:48:21,049
And we're doing it
20 times a day.

691
00:48:21,117 --> 00:48:24,319
So don't give me
that crap. Do it.

692
00:48:36,265 --> 00:48:37,199
<i>[Helen]
Hello?</i>

695
00:48:40,002 --> 00:48:41,536
<i>Yes. Go ahead.</i>

697
00:48:44,107 --> 00:48:45,373
<i>For lunch tomorrow?</i>

698
00:48:45,441 --> 00:48:46,875
I suppose so. Where?

699
00:48:46,943 --> 00:48:48,710
Same place.

700
00:48:48,778 --> 00:48:49,711
1:00.

701
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:51,713

00:48:51,781 --> 00:48:53,782
See you tomorrow.

703
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,285
Remember, I need you.

[Thunder]

705
00:49:14,971 --> 00:49:18,607
I thought that we might
have lunch together tomorrow.

706
00:49:19,775 --> 00:49:22,644
Um, you know, darn it,
I'm meeting Allison.

707
00:49:22,712 --> 00:49:24,646
We're going to go shopping.

708
00:49:24,714 --> 00:49:27,048
Sorry.

709
00:49:27,116 --> 00:49:29,985
No problem.

710

[Arf]

711
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:07,455
I think you're going
about this all wrong.

712
00:50:07,523 --> 00:50:10,192
See, women like you
to talk to them.

713
00:50:10,259 --> 00:50:13,528
And maybe you're not in touch
with your feminine side.

714

Sally Jessy Raphael--</i>

715

All right. O.K.
I got the usual stuff here.

716
00:50:18,935 --> 00:50:21,369
I got a telemetry-burst
transmitter, a GPS tracker,

717
00:50:21,437 --> 00:50:23,405
An audio transmitter,
a power supply,

718
00:50:23,472 --> 00:50:26,107
I've got it
sewn into the lining here--

719

Hey, Harry?

If you need to talk...
Speak into the purse.

721

O.K. Here she comes.

722
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:39,221
She'll pop out
right in front of us.

723
00:50:39,288 --> 00:50:40,422
Watch. Bingo!

724
00:50:44,493 --> 00:50:46,861
Looks like she's going
into Chinatown.

725
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:52,100
O.K., she's parking.

726
00:50:59,909 --> 00:51:02,444
O.K., give me audio.

727
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,454
You sure
you weren't followed?

728
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:18,260
No. I kept looking behind me
like you taught me,

729
00:51:18,327 --> 00:51:19,995
But I didn't see anyone.

730
00:51:20,062 --> 00:51:22,163
Things are a bit hot now.

731
00:51:22,231 --> 00:51:25,634
If I get a signal,
I may have to leave suddenly.

732
00:51:25,701 --> 00:51:27,202

Look, it's my job to take risks,
but not yours.

735
00:51:35,044 --> 00:51:37,479
I feel bad about
bringing you into this,

736
00:51:37,546 --> 00:51:39,581
But you're the only one
I can trust.

737
00:51:39,649 --> 00:51:41,983
Were you out
on a mission?

738
00:51:42,051 --> 00:51:43,018
Shh.

739
00:51:43,085 --> 00:51:47,522
We say "op."
covert operation,

740
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:49,224
And this one, well,

741
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:50,525
Got a little rough.

742
00:51:50,593 --> 00:51:51,860
Worse than Cairo?

743
00:51:51,927 --> 00:51:53,228
Cairo.

744
00:51:53,296 --> 00:51:57,532
Cairo was a day at the beach
next to this.

745
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,034
The guy's a spook.

746
00:51:59,101 --> 00:52:00,435
But for whom?

747
00:52:00,503 --> 00:52:02,904
Could be working her
to get to you.

748
00:52:02,972 --> 00:52:05,407
Did you read
the papers yesterday?

749
00:52:05,474 --> 00:52:07,175
Yes.

750
00:52:11,414 --> 00:52:14,749
Sometimes the story's
a mask for covert operation.

751
00:52:14,817 --> 00:52:17,252
See two men killed
in a restaurant

752
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,689
And two unidentified men
in a shoot-out
at the Marriott?

753
00:52:20,756 --> 00:52:22,357

You recognize my style.

00:52:25,328 --> 00:52:27,996
You're a natural
at this.

757

He's taking credit
for our moves.

758
00:52:30,466 --> 00:52:31,399
What happened?

759
00:52:31,467 --> 00:52:33,034
Hardly worth talking about.

760
00:52:33,102 --> 00:52:35,870
Two of them won't
bother me again.

761
00:52:35,938 --> 00:52:36,871
Unbelievable!

<i>You chased one?</i>

763
00:52:39,475 --> 00:52:43,411
I had to nail this guy
no matter what the risk.

764
00:52:43,479 --> 00:52:46,281
Pretty hairy.I thought
he had me a couple times,

765
00:52:46,349 --> 00:52:48,750
But I really
can't take credit.

766
00:52:48,818 --> 00:52:49,951
Why not?

767
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:51,486
It's the training.

768
00:52:51,554 --> 00:52:53,822
It shapes you into
a lethal instrument.

769
00:52:53,889 --> 00:52:56,624
You react in a microsecond
without thinking.

770
00:52:56,692 --> 00:52:58,626
I'm starting
to like this guy.

771
00:52:58,694 --> 00:53:02,430
We've still got to kill him.
That's a given.

I'm sorry. I know

See, it's not just a car.

It's a total image.
An identity.

You have to go for it.

an angle.

Oh, it's killer.

I'm not that much to look at.

No, no.
I can be honest.

804

Oh, oh, oh, oh, no.

Sorry. Trade secret.
