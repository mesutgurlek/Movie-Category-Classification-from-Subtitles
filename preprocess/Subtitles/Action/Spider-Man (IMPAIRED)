1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,900
Even now I can feel it

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,900
Buried somewhere deep inside.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,400
... watching me.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,900
... waiting.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,400
But you know what scares me the most?

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,400
When I can't fight it anymore...

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,900
... when it takes over ...

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,900
... when I totally lose control ...

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,900
... I like it.

10
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,900
Who am I? You sure you want to know?

11
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,900
The story of my life is not for the faint of heart.

12
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,100
If somebody said it was a happy little tale,

13
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,100
If somebody told you I was just your average ordinary
guy, not a care in the world,

14
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,400
Somebody lied.

15
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,100
But let me assure you

16
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,100
This like any story worth telling,
is all about a girl.

17
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,700
That girl. 

18
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,000
The girl next door.  Mary Jane Watson.

19
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,200
The woman I've loved since before I even liked girls.

20
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,500
I'd like to tell you that's me next to her,

21
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Aw heck, I'd even take him.

22
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,900
Hey stop the bus! [Laughing from inside the bus]

23
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,200
That's me.

24
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,500
Tell him to stop please!

25
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Hey stop the bus!

26
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Stop the bus! He's been chasing us since Woodhind Blvd.

27
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,700
Thank you.  Sorry I'm late.

28
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,900
Don't even think about it.

29
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,900
You're so lame Parker.

30
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Midtown High Seniors, No wandering.
Proceed direct ...Knock it off...

31
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,000
Remember, it is a privilege to be here.

32
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We are guests of Columbia University
Science Department,so behave accordingly.

33
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Let's not have a repeat of our
trip to the planetarium.

34
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,700
C'mon people, let's stay together.
Proceed up the steps and into the building.

35
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,700
Dad would you ask Hoskins to drive around the corner please.

36
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,100
Why? The entrance is right there.

37
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,100
Dad these are public school kids,
I'm not showing up for the field trip in a Rolls.

38
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,500
You want me to trade in my care for a Jetta just because 
you flunked out of every private school I ever sent you to?

39
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,800
It wasn't for me.

40
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,700
Of course it was.

41
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,500
Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.

42
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,200
I'm not ashamed of who I am, it's just..
-Just what Harry?

43
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Forget it.

44
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,300
Hey Pete!

45
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,000
Hiya Harry.

46
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,300
Harry! Won't you be needing this?

47
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,800
Thanks Dad.

48
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Um, Peter may I introduce my father, Norman Oswald.

49
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,000
Peter, I've heard so much about you.

50
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,700
It's a great honour to meet you sir.

51
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,600
Harry tells me you're quite the science whiz.

52
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,600
Y'know, I'm something of a scientist myself.

53
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,800
I read all your research on nanotechnology. Really Brilliant.

54
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,900
And you understood it?

55
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,700
Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

56
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,200
Impressive.

57
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,100
Your parents must be very proud of you.

58
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,100
I live with my aunt and uncle, they are proud.

59
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,300
Hey you two! Let's move!

60
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Nice to meet you.
-I'll see you again.
-Yeah.

61
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,800
He didn't seem so bad.

62
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,300
Not if you're a genius.
He'd love to adopt you.

63
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,300
There are over 32,000 known species of spiders
in the world. They're in the order aranae ...

64
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Wow, that's amazing! This is the most advanced
electron microscope in the eastern seaboard.

65
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,000
It's unreal.

66
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Arachnids from all three groups possess varying
strengths which help them in their constant search for food.

67
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,100
For example, the Delena spider, family Sporacidae,
has the ability to jump to catch its prey.

68
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,300
For the school paper?

69
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Next we have the netweb spider, family
Philus Tetidae, Genus Cucacamia. 

70
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It spins an intricate funnel shaped web whose strands
have a tensile strength proportionately equal

71
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
to the type of high tension wire...

72
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,100
Leave him alone.

73
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,900
Or what?

74
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,900
Or his father will fire you father.

75
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,900
What's Daddy gonna do?  Sue me?

76
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,700
What is going on? The next person who talks
will fail this course. I kid you not.

77
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,900
This grass spider hunts using a set of 
relexes with nerve conduction so fast 

78
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,600
that some researches believe it
almost borders on precognition...

79
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,200
-Those guys are jerks.
-...an imminent awareness of danger, a "spider-sense".

80
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,400
Hey look at that spider.

81
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Some spiders change colours to blend into their environment.

82
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,200
It's a defense mechanism.

83
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,400
Peter, what makes you think I would want to know that?

84
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,800
Who wouldn't?

85
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Over five painstaking years Columbia's genetic research facility has...

86
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,000
Gonna talk to her now?

87
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No, go on, you talk to her.

88
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,700
-Disgusting.
-I hate the little things.

89
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,700
-I love 'em.
-Yeah me too.

90
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,200
You know, spiders can change their colour to blend into their environment.

91
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,000
Really?

92
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.

93
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,900
Cool.

94
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,900
...combining the genetic information from all three spiders into these fifteen genetically designed super-spiders.

95
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,800
There's fourteen.

96
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,500
I beg your pardon?

97
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,500
One's missing.

98
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,100
I guess the researchers are working on that one.

99
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Did you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the eastern seaboard?

100
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You were talking throughout this entire
presentation.  Let's go talk about how we listen.

101
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't know what it's like at those fancy private schools but ...

102
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,100
Hey, could I take your picture?

103
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,500
I need one with a student in it.

104
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Sure. Yeah, where do you want me? Over here?

105
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,900
Yeah, yeah that's great.

106
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,200
Don't make me look ugly.

107
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,200
That's impossible.

108
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Perfect.

109
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,900
-That good?
-Great.

110
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,100
That's great. [she giggles]

111
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,300
MJ, let's go.

112
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,300
Wait, thanks!

113
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:42,200
Parker.  Let's do it.

114
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,300
We've solved the horizon glide. And the multi-G balance issues.

115
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,300
I've already seen the glider.  That's not what I'm here for.

116
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,100
General Slocum, good to see you again.

117
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,300
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Farthus.

118
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,300
-Norman.
-Mr. Osbourne.

119
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,100
Always a pleasure to have our board of directors pay us a little visit.

120
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,500
I want to see the progress report on Human performance enhancers.

121
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,600
We tried vapour inhalation with rodent subjects.  

122
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,300
They showed an 800 percent increase in strength.

123
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,600
Any side effects?

124
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,900
-In one trial yes.
-It was an aberration.

125
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,000
All the tests since then have been successful.

126
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And in the trial that went wrong what were the side effects.

127
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,700
-Violence, aggression ... and insanity.
-And what do you recommend?

128
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
That was only one test.  

129
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,600
With the exception of Dr. Strom our entire staff
certifies the product ready for human testing.

130
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Dr. Strom?

131
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,000
We need to take the whole line back to formula.

132
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,500
Back to formula?

133
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Dr. Osbourne!  I'm going to be frank with you.
I never supported your program.  

134
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,500
We have my predecessor to thank for that.

135
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,700
Norman, the General gave the go-ahead to request aerospace to build a prototype of their exoskeleton design.

136
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
They test in two weeks.

137
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,400
And if your so-called performance enhancers
have not had a successful human trial by that date, 

138
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,400
I'm going to pull your funding.

139
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,200
I'm going to give it to them

140
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Gentlemen, ladies.

141
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."

142
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,400
And Voila!  There is light! Forty soft glowin' watts of it.

143
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Oh good boy, God will be thrilled.  Just don't fall on your ass.

144
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,900
I'm already on my ass, May.

145
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,900
When the plant senior electrician is laid off
after thirty-five years what else would you call it?

146
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,600
I am on my ass.

147
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,700
Hand me that dish, the green one.

148
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,700
The corporation is downsizing the
people and upsizing the profits.

149
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,300
Ben, you'll get another job somewhere.

150
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Well, let's look at the paper and see.  

151
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,200
Here are the want ads what do we got here?

152
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Computer .. computer salesman, computer engineer, computer analyst 

153
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,800
... my Lord even the computers need analysts these days.

154
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,900
May, I'm sixty eight years old, I'm too old for computers and
besides I've got a family to provide for.

155
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
I love you and Peter loves you.  You're the
most responsible man I've ever known.

156
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,800
We've been down and out before, but somehow we've survived.

157
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,100
Yeah,..

158
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Oh, hi sweetie, you're just in time for dinner.

159
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,400
How you doing buddie?  How was the field trip?

160
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,300
I don't feel well, I'm going to go to sleep.

161
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,800
You won't have a bite?

162
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,700
No thanks, had a bite.

163
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,400
Did you get some pictures Peter?

164
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,400
I gotta crash, everything's fine.

165
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,900
What's that all about?

166
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,600
[synthesized transfer-RNA .. into these fifteen
genetically enhanced super-spiders...]

167
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,800
Dr. Osbourne, please.  The performance enhancers aren't ready.

168
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,200
The data just doesn't justify this test.

169
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,100
I'm asking you for the last time.  We can't do this.

170
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Don't be a coward. Risks are part of laboratory science.

171
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,600
Look let me reschedule.  With the proper medical staff and a volunteer.

172
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,400
-If you just give me two weeks...
-Two weeks!?

173
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,400
We'll have lost the contract and Oscorp will be dead.

174
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,800
Sometimes you've got to do things yourself.

175
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,400
Get me the Promochloraparazine.

176
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,700
For what?

177
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,700
It begins catalyzation when the
vapour hits the bloodstream.

178
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,300
Forty thousand years of evolution and we've
barely even tapped the vastness of human potential.

179
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Norman? ... 

180
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,600
Norman! 

181
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,600
... Norman!

182
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,300
Oh my God!

183
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,300
Oh my God! Norman.

184
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,800
Norman.

185
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Norman, no.

186
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Back to formula?!

187
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Weird.

188
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,300
[knock]
Peter?

189
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,300
Yeah.

190
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,000
Are you all right?

191
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,800
I'm fine.

192
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,500
Are you better this morning?
Any change?

193
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Change?
Yeah. Big change.

194
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,600
Well, hurry up!  You're going to be late.

195
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Right.

196
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,600
-Goodness me.

197
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,600
-I thought you were sick.
-I got better. Bye guys!

198
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,400
You haven't eaten anything,
have you got your lunch money?

199
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,200
Yeah I've got it.

200
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,800
Hey Michaelangelo don't forget
we're painting the kitchen right after school.

201
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,400
-Got it?
-Sure thing Uncle Ben.

202
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,400
-Don't start without me.
-And don't start up with me.

203
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,100
Teenagers, raging hormones they never change.

204
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,900
...you're trash! You're always going to be trash just like her.

205
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,900
-I have to go to school.[sobs]
-Aw, who's stoppin' you.

206
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,100
Hi MJ ...Hey MJ, I don't know if you realize
this but we've been neighbours since I was six 

207
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,100
and I was wondering if maybe we could get
together sometime and do something fun ..

208
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,900
or I don't know, I thought it'd be fun to get to know each other ...

209
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,700
...or not...

210
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Hey, stop the bus.

211
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,700
Dad? Dad, are you all right?

212
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Harry, ...[groan]

213
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,800
What are you doing on the floor?

214
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,100
I don't know.

215
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,900
Have you been there all night?

216
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,900
I ... last night I was ...

217
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,100
What?

218
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
I don't remember.

219
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,500
-Mr. Osbourne.
-Sir I asked her to wait in the foyer.

220
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,500
-I'm sorry my father's not feeling well-
-Mr. Osbourne, Dr. Strom is dead.

221
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,600
-What?
-They found his body this morning in the lab.

222
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,000
He's been murdered sir.

223
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,700
What are you talking about.

224
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,400
-And the flight suit and the glider,--
-What about it?

225
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,400
It's been stolen, sir.

226
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,200
Wow! Great reflexes.

227
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,300
-Thanks.
-No problem.

228
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Hey, blue eyes.  I didn't notice without
your glasses.  Did you just get contacts?

229
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Well, see ya.

230
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,600
Parker?

231
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,000
Think you're pretty funny don't you, freak?

232
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,700
-Flash it was just an accident.
-My fist breaking your teeth is the accident.

233
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,200
-C'mon Flash, stop.
-I don't want to fight you Flash.

234
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,200
I wouldn't want to fight me neither.

235
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,100
Help him Harry.

236
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,100
Which one?

237
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,100
All yours man.

238
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Jesus Parker, you are a freak.

239
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Peter, that was amazing.

240
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Peter.

241
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,200
Go web!

242
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,400
Fly!

243
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,100
Up up and away web!

244
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,000
Shazam!

245
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,200
Go!

246
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,200
Go! Go web go!

247
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,100
Tally-ho...

248
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,600
[sounds of shouted argument]

249
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,200
Were you listening to that?

250
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,200
No.  Well, I heard but I was just taking out the trash.

251
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,400
I guess you can always hear us.

252
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,900
Well, everybody shouts.

253
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,800
Your aunt and uncle don't.

254
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,800
Oh, they can scream pretty good sometimes.

255
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Listen, MJ, about today ... at school with Flash ...

256
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,400
You really freaked us out.

257
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,700
I'm sorry.

258
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,600
Is he ok?

259
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,600
He's just happy you didn't give him a black eye for graduation.

260
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,500
So where you going after you graduate?

261
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,900
I want to move into the city and hopefully get a job as a photographer.

262
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,100
Work my way through college.

263
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,400
What about you?

264
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Headed for the city too. Can't wait to get out of here.

265
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,600
-I wanna ...
-What?

266
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,000
C'mon, try me.

267
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I wanna .. act.  On stage.

268
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,300
Really?  That's perfect.  You were awesome in all the school plays.

269
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,100
Really?

270
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,100
Yeah, I cried like a baby when you played Cinderella.

271
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,700
Peter, that was first grade.

272
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,700
Well, even so.

273
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Sometimes you know people.

274
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You can just see what's coming.

275
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,200
What do you see coming for you?

276
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,200
I don't know.  Whatever it is...

277
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,700
It's something I've never felt before.

278
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,500
And what for me?

279
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,100
For you, you're going to light up Broadway.

280
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,800
You know, 

281
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,100
you're taller than you look.

282
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,800
I hunch.

283
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Don't.

284
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Come take a ride in my new birthday present.

285
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,900
I gotta go.

286
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
Bye.

287
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,800
Oh my god, gorgeous! Look at it!

288
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,800
Hop in. Pretty exciting huh? Don't scratch the leather.

289
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Cool car.

290
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,700
Peter, what's going on in there?

291
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,100
I'm exercising.  I'm not dressed Aunt May.

292
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,100
Well, you're acting so strangely Peter.

293
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,100
Ok, thanks.

294
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:57,100
[evil laughter]

295
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,800
Something's bothering him.
Maybe he's too embarrased to tell me what it is.

296
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,100
Maybe I'm too embarrased to ask him.

297
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,400
I don't know, I just don't know anymore.

298
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,400
I'm going to the downtown library, I'll see you later.

299
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,700
-Oh, wait Pete! I'll drive you there buddy.
-I'll take the train.

300
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,700
-No I need the exercise.  Just go on, go go go.

301
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,800
-Thanks for the ride Uncle Ben.
-Now wait a minute, we need to talk.

302
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,800
-We can talk later.
-We can talk now. If you'll let me.

303
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,400
What do we have to talk about, why now?

304
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,400
Because we haven't talked at all for so long,
your Aunt May and I don't even know who you are any more.

305
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,900
You shirk your chores, you have all
those weird experiments in your room.

306
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,900
-You start fights at school.
-I didn't start that fight, I told you that.

307
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,900
-Well you sure as hell finished it.
-What was I supposed to do, run away?

308
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,400
No, no you're not supposed to run away.

309
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,400
But, Pete look, you're changing.  I know, I
went through exactly the same thing at your age.

310
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,000
No, Not exactly.

311
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Peter, these are the years when a man changes
into the man he's going to become the rest of his life.

312
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,100
Just be careful who you change into.

313
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,600
This guy, Flash Thompson, he
probably deserved what happened.

314
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,800
But just because you can beat him
up doesn't give you the right to.

315
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Remember, 'With great power
comes great responsibility'.

316
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,500

Make it page eight and give 'em 10 percent off. No make it 5 percent.

471
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,900
-That can't be done --
-Get outta here!

472
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,100
Problem is we don't have a decent picture.

473
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,100
Eddie's been on it for weeks, we can barely get a glimpse of him.

474
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,800
Aw, what is he, shy?

475
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,300
We can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong we can certainly get a picture of this weirdo.

476
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:56,100
Put an ad on the front page.  Cash money for a picture of Spiderman.

477
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:00,100
He doesn't wanna be famous?  Then I'll make him infamous!

478
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,000
Hey!

479
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,200
Buzz off!

480
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,700
MJ. It's me. Peter.

481
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,600
Hi!

482
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,700
Hey.

483
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,400
What are you doing around here.

484
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,200
I'm begging for a job. How about you?

485
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,500
I'm headed to an audition.

486
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,300
An audition? So you're acting now?

487
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:32,300
Yeah, I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

488
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,000
That's great MJ.

489
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,400
You're doing it.  You're living your dream.

490
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,100
Hey counter girl!  Your drawer was short six dollars!

491
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,800
Next time that happens, I'm gonna take it outta your cheque!

492
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,800
Excuse me Miss Watson!  I'm talkin' to you. Hey!

493
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,300
Yes Enrique, I get you.

494
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:54,300
Well, it better not happen no more,
hear me? Don't roll your eyes at me.

495
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,200
Some dream huh?

496
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,900
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

497
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,000
Don't tell Harry.

498
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,100
Don't tell Harry?

499
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,100
Aren't you guys living together?
We're going out, didn't he tell you?

500
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,900
Oh yeah, right. I think he'd hate the idea of my waiting tables.

501
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,200
He'd think it was low or something.

502
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,200
It's not low. You have a job. Harry, doesn't live on a little place I like to call earth.

503
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,800
No, no I guess not.

504
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,000
Thanks Pete.

505
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
We should catch up sometime.

506
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,600
Let's get some lunch some evening.

507
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,600
Uh, I'll come by and have some of your moondance coffee some day.

508
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,600
And I won't tell Harry.

509
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,000
No, don't tell Harry.

510
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,700
I won't.

511
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,700
I won't tell Harry.

512
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:26,300
Stormin' Norman's making his weekly inspection.

513
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,400
He's spent half of it on the phone.

514
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:33,400
I'm glad you're here. I need your help. I'm really lost here.

515
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:39,100
Are you all right? You look like you just got second place in the science fair.

516
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,800
No I, uh, was late for work and Dr. Connors fired me.

517
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:51,500
You were late again? I don't get it. Where do you go all the time?

518
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,000
Around.

519
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,900
Peter Parker. Maybe you'll tell me who she is.

520
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,000
Who's that?

521
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
This mystery girl Harry's been dating.  When do I get to meet her?

522
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:07,100
Oh, sorry, Harry hasn't mentioned her.

523
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,400
Hey Peter you're probably7 looking for a job now right?

524
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,500
Dad maybe you can help him out.

525
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,800
No I appreciate it but I'll be fine.

526
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,300
It's no problem.  I'll make a few calls.

527
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,300
No I couldn't accept it sir. I'd like to earn what I get.

528
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,200
I can find my own work.

529
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,200
I respect that. You want to make it on your own steam. That's great. That's great.

530
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,300
What other skills do you have Parker.

531
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:39,300
I was thinking of something in photography.

532
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:43,700
Hello.

533
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,900
Let's go! Let's move it!

534
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,900
Watch the street!

535
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,200
Cheese!

536
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:18,500
They're crap. Crap. Crap. Mega-crap.

537
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,700
I'll give you 200 bucks for all of 'em.

538
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,300
That seems a little low.

539
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,100
Take 'em somewhere else then.

540
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:27,400
Sir your wife said that tile you want in the foyer is out of stock.

541
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,400
Tell her we'll just put a rug there. Sit down!

542
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:36,400
I'll give you 300.  That's a standard freelance fee.

543
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,200
-Tear up page one.  Run that photo instead.
-Headline?

544
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:41,300
-'Spiderman Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos.'

545
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:45,300
-Menace? He was protecting that--
-Tell you what, Atticus you take the pictures I'll make up the headlines, ok?

546
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,800
That ok with you.

547
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,600
Yes sir.

548
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,600
Goodie. Give this to the girl up front. She'll see you get paid.

549
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,900
I'd like a job sir.

550
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,700
No jobs. Freelance! Best thing in the world for a kid your age.

551
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:02,700
Bring me some more shots of that newspaper selling clown, maybe I'll take 'em off your hands.

552
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,100
But I never said you have a job.

553
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:09,100
Meat! I'll send you a nice box of Christmas meat. Best I can do. Get outta here.  Bring me more photos.

554
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,400
Hi.

555
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,500
Mr. Jameson told me to give that to you.

556
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,700
Oh, welcome to the Daily Bugle.

557
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,900
Thank you.

558
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,000
I'm Peter Parker. I'm a photographer.

559
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,500
Yes, I can see that.

560
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:48,600
As of today, Oscorp Industries has surpassed Quest
Aerospace as the principal supplier to the United States Military.

561
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:58,000
In short ladies and gentlemen of the board, costs are
down, revenues are up, and our stock has never been higher.

562
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,400
Wonderful news Norman. Wonderful. In fact, it's the reason for selling the company.

563
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,400
What?

564
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,100
Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing in the wake of the bombing.

565
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:13,100
Expanding. They made a tender offer that we can't ignore.

566
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,500
Why wasn't I told.

567
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:19,500
The last thing they want is a power struggle with entrenched management.

568
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:22,200
The deal is off if you come with it.

569
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,100
The board expects your resignation in 30 days.

570
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:30,100
You can't do this to me. 

571
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,400
I started this company.

572
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,400
You know how much I sacrificed?!

573
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,400
Oh Max please.

574
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,400
Norman, the board is unanimous.

575
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:50,500
We're announcing the sale after the World Unity Festival.

576
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,200
I'm sorry.

577
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,200
You're out Norman.

578
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,400
Am I?

579
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,100
Welcome to Oscorp Industries'
Unity Day Festival.

580
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:19,100
Let's hear it for Macy Gray!

581
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,800
MJ, why didn't you wear the black dress?

582
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,000
It's just, I wanted to impress my father.

583
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,600
He loves black.

584
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,500
Well, maybe he'll be impressed no matter what.

585
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,400
You think I'm pretty.

586
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,400
I think you're beautiful.

587
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,500
MJ would you do me a favour?

588
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:28,500
I forgot my drink inside.

589
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:40,100
Oh hi Mr. Fargus.  Have you seen my father around.

590
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:45,300
Well, I'm not sure if he's coming today.

591
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,000
What is that?

592
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
It must be new this year.

593
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:09,300
That's our glider!

594
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
What the hell was that?

595
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:38,500
Ha ha ha ha!

596
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:06,800
Oh my God! Harry!

597
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,800
MJ!

598
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:26,300
OUT AM I!?

599
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,700
Hello my dear.

600
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:40,700
It's Spiderman.

601
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:54,400
C'mon move kid.

602
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:04,800
Mommy!

603
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,900
Hold it right there.

604
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:07,000
I surrender.

605
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,800
Oh boy.

606
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,800
Hold it right there.

607
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:20,100
Impressive!

608
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,800
Help!

609
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:46,800
Mary Jane!

610
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,400
Hold on!

611
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:16,400
Watch out!

612
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,800
We'll meet again Spiderman!

613
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,800
Well, beats takin' the subway.

614
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,800
Don't mind us, she just needs to use the elevator.

615
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,900
Wait! Who are you?

616
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,400
You know who I am.

617
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,500
I do?

618
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:27,500
Your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman.

619
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:42,500
Incredible? What do you mean he's incredible?

620
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
No alright. Wait, stay there, I'm going to come over. 

621
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,600
No, I'm going to come ove--alright fine will you call me in the morning.

622
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:57,900
And we'll go and have breakfast and I want to buy you something. 

623
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,600
Because I want to, it'll make you feel better.

624
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,800
Ok, and what do you mean incredible.

625
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:13,100
Alright, I'm sorry.  Sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs-- [click].

626
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:23,400
She's alright. She's just a little rattled.

627
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,300
Look Pete, I should have told you about us.

628
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:33,200
You should know I'm crazy about her.
It's just, you know, you never made a move.  

629
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
You're right, I didn't.

630
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,900
I'm going to get some rest.

631
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,400
I'm going to stay up for a while.

632
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,200
What was that thing?

633
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,000
I don't know. 

634
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Whatever it is, somebody has to stop it.

635
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,100
Somebody there?

636
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,600
Somebody?

637
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:24,600
Who said that?

638
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,600
You've known all along!

639
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,700
Where are you?

640
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:40,700
Follow the cold shiver running down your spine.

641
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:51,300
I'm right here!

642
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,200
I don't understand.

643
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,600
Did you think it was coincidence.

644
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,600
So many good things all happening for you. All for you Norman.

645
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,800
What do you want?

646
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,800
To say what you won't. To do what you can't.
To remove those in your way.

647
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:27,400
The board members. You killed them?

648
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:31,800
We killed them. Remember? Your little accident in the laboratory.

649
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:39,100
Performance enhancers.

650
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:43,100
Bingo. Me! Your greatest creation. 

651
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:48,400
Bringing you what you've always wanted.

652
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,400
Power, beyond your wildest dreams. And it's only the beginning.

653
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:00,200
There's only one who can stop us.
Or ... imagine if he joined us.

654
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,300
Spiderman. And the Green Goblin. 

655
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:16,300
Green Goblin. Like that? Made it up myself.
These weirdo's all gotta have a name now.

656
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:21,100
Hoffman, call the patent office, copyright the name Green Goblin, I want a quarter every time somebody says it.

657
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:31,300
Spiderman wasn't attacking the city he was trying to save it. That's slander.

658
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:35,300
It is not! I resent that. Slander is spoken. In print it's libel.

659
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,900
You don't trust anybody, that's your problem.

660
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,500
I trust my barber.

661
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,200
What are you his lawyer? Get out of here!

662
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,600
Let him sue me, get rich like a normal person.

663
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,600
That's what made this country--

664
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:58,600
Jameson, you slime!

665
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,300
Who's the photographer who takes the pictures of Spiderman?

666
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,400
I don't know who he is.  His stuff comes in the mail.

667
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,600
-You're lying!
-I swear.

668
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,900
He's the one who can bring me to him.

669
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,200
I don't know who he is.

670
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:14,200
-You are useless you...
-Set him down tough guy.

671
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:18,100
-Speak of the devil.
-Spiderman! I knew you two were in this together.

672
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:21,400
Hey kiddo. Let mom and dad talk for a minute will you?

673
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:25,400
Sleep!

674
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,800
Wake up little spider.  Wake up.

675
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:47,100
No, you're not dead, yet.  Just paralyzed, temporarily.

676
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:57,100
You're an amazing creature Spiderman. You and I are not so different.

677
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:03,000
I'm not like you.  You're a murderer.

678
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Well, to each his own. I chose my path, you chose the way of the hero.

679
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:13,700
And they found you amusing for a while.  The people of this city.

680
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,600
But the one thing they love more than a hero is to see a hero fail. Fall.

681
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,500
Die trying.

682
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:26,400
In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually they will hate you.

683
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,000
Why bother?

684
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,200
Because, it's right.

685
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:34,200
Here's the real truth.  There are 8 million people in this city

686
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:44,300
and those teeming masses exist for the sole purpose
of lifting the few exceptional people onto their shoulders.

687
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:49,100
You and me, we're exceptional. I could squash
you like a bug right now but I'm offering you a choice.  

688
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:00,400
Join me. Imagine what we could accomplish together, what we could create.

689
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,900
Or we could destroy. 

690
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:10,900
Cause the deaths of countless innocents in selfish battle again and again and again until we're both dead!

691
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:18,100
Is that what you want? Think about it hero!

692
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:37,300
In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually they will hate you.

693
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:49,600
Hey, it's me again. 

694
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,500
Hey.

695
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,300
How was your audition?

696
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,300
How'd you know.

697
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:57,300
The hotline.  Your Mom, told my Aunt, told me.

698
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,400
So you just came by?

699
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:03,200
I was in the neighbourhood, needed to see a friendly face.

700
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:07,200
I took two buses and a cab to get in the neighbourhood but ...

701
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,700
So how'd it go?

702
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:15,700
They said I needed acting lessons. A soap opera told me I needed acting lessons.

703
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:22,500
Let me buy you a cheese burger. The sky's the limit up to seven dollars and eighty for cents.

704
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,600
I'd like a cheese burger, oh but I'm going out to dinner with Harry.  

705
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,300
Come with us.
-No thanks.

706
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:39,300
How's it going with-- Ah nevermind. It's none of my business.

707
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,600
It's not? 

708
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,900
Why so interested?

709
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,700
I'm not.

710
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,900
You're not?

711
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,500
Well, why would I be?

712
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:56,500
I don't know. Why would you be?

713
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:01,300
I don't know.

714
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:07,500
Sorry you won't come with us.

715
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:12,900
I better run tiger.

716
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:23,500
Hey check it out man..

717
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,800
Hey where you going baby, come on.

718
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:51,700
Get off me!

719
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:26,700
Wait.

720
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:31,500
You have a knack for getting in trouble.

721
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,100
You have a knack for saving my life.

722
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,600
I think I have a superhero stalker.

723
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,800
I was in the neighbourhood.

724
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,200
You are amazing.

725
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:47,100
Some people don't think so.

726
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:49,000
But you are.

727
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,500
It's nice to have a fan.

728
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,000
Do I get to say thank you this time?

729
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Wait...

730
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:06,000
I have to get in there! My baby's in there! My baby's in there!
-I can't let you in there, the roof's about to collapse.

731
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
-Let me go! My baby!
-I can't let you in there, the roof's about to collapse.

732
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:18,400
Look, up there!

733
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:26,200
Save my baby please!

734
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:51,100
No!

735
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,700
It's ok, your baby's fine.

736
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,200
Oh my baby!

737
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,900
Bless you Spiderman! Bless you.

738
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:06,800
There he is, don't let him get away!

739
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,100
Hold it right there!

740
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,900
You're under arrest, I'm taking you in.

741
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:13,900
Oh my God, there's somebody still up there.

742
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,500
I'm going.

743
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,100
I'll be here when you get back.

744
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:20,800
Not coming back chief.

745
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,800
Go! Go!

746
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:39,000
Where are you?!

747
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:45,500
I'm going to get you out of here!

748
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:50,400
It's ok!

749
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
You're pathetically predictable, like a moth to the flame.

750
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:04,500
What about my generous proposal? Are you in or are you out?

751
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,200
It's you who's out Gobby. Out of your mind.

752
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:13,500
Wrong answer!

753
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,500
Oh great.

754
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:58,900
No one says no to me!

755
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,700
MJ would you stop goofing around?

756
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:09,500
Harry relax!

757
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,200
He's here.

758
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,000
Are you ready?

759
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,300
Yeah.

760
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,700
Ah, Aunt May, I'm sorry I'm late.

761
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,600
Work was murder.

762
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,300
I picked up a fruit cake.

763
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:23,800
Why thank you Mr. Osbourne, we're so glad you could come.

764
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:24,800
-You look great.
-Thanks.

765
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,000
Who's this lovely new lady?

766
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,100
MJ I'd like you to meet my father, Norman Osbourne.

767
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,700
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

768
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:32,600
Hi.

769
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:35,400
How do you do? I've been looking forward to meeting you.

770
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,600
Happy Thanksgiving sir.

771
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,600
Now where is Peter. He'd better have remembered that cranberry sauce.

772
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:51,100
Oh, that's weird, I didn't know he was here.

773
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,600
Peter?

774
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:03,500
Peter?

775
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:07,500
Is that you?

776
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:10,300
Pete?

777
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:14,300
How strange. There's nobody here.

778
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:22,600
Bit of a slob isn't he?

779
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:26,600
All brilliant men are.

780
01:27:58,500 --> 01:27:59,400
Hey everyone!

781
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,600
Peter!

782
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:04,600
Sorry I'm late. It's a jungle out there, I had to beat an old lady with a stick to get these cranberries.

783
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:11,100
Thank you. Now then everybody sit down and we can say grace.

784
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,900
It all looks delicious.

785
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:30,900
Norman! Will you do the honours?

786
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:48,200
Why Peter, you're bleeding.

787
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:52,900
Oh, yeah, I stepped off a curb and got clipped by one of those bike messengers.

788
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:59,700
Let me see. Oh my goodness. Oh that looks awful. 

789
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:04,100
-It's nothing.
-I'll get the first aid kit.

790
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:08,100
Then we'll say grace. This is the boys' first Thanksgiving in this apartment and we are going to do things properly.

791
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,700
How did you say that happened.

792
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:18,700
Bike messenger. Knocked me down.

793
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:27,000
If you'll excuse me, I've got to be going.

794
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,600
Why?

795
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:32,600
Something has come to my attention.

796
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,700
Are you all right?

797
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:35,200
I'm fine, just fine.

798
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:39,000
Thank you Mrs. Parker, everyone, enjoy the fruitcake.

799
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Dad! Dad, what are you doing?

800
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,600
I plan this whole thing so you can meet MJ and now you've got to leave?

801
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:48,000
I've got to go.

802
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,900
Dad, this girl is important to me.

803
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:52,600
Harry, please. Look at her.

804
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:56,600
Do you think a woman like that is sniffing around because she likes your personality?

805
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,200
Your mother was beautiful too, they're all beautiful, 

806
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:05,200
until they're snarling after your trust fund like a pack of ravening wolves.

807
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,400
You're wrong about her Dad.

808
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,600
A word to the not so wise about your little girlfriend, 

809
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:14,600
do what you need to with her, then broom her fast.

810
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,600
Thanks for sticking up for me Harry.

811
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,100
You heard?

812
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:31,100
Everyone heard that creep!

813
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:35,100
That creep is my father. If I'm lucky I'll become half of what he is so just keep your mouth shut about stuff you don't understand.

814
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,000
Harry Osbourne!

815
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
I'm sorry Aunt May.

816
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:49,100
Spiderman is all but invincible but Parker -- we can destroy him.

817
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:53,400
I can't.

818
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:57,400
Betrayal must not be countenanced! Parker must be educated.

819
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:02,600
What do I do.

820
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:06,600
Instruct him in the matters of loss and pain.

821
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:08,400
Make him suffer.

822
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,900
Make him wish that he were dead.

823
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:14,900
-Yes.
-And then grant his wish.

824
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,600
But how?

825
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:20,400
The cunning warrior attacks neither body nor mind.

826
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,800
Tell me how!

827
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:25,800
The heart Osbourne! First we attack his heart!

828
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,900
Give us this day our daily bread. 

829
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:32,700
And forgive us our trespasses 

830
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:35,300
as we forgive those who tresspass against us.

831
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:39,300
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us --

832
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:50,900
Deliver us!

833
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:54,000
Finish it! Finish it!

834
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
..Evil!

835
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:10,300
Aunt May! Is she going to be ok? What happened?

836
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:13,500
Yes she's going to be ok. Look you're going to have to leave right now.

837
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:17,500
Those eyes, those horrible yellow eyes.

838
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:27,500
He knows who I am.

839
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:13,900
I'm sorry.

840
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,200
Will she be ok?

841
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,000
She's going to be fine.

842
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,000
She's been sleeping all day.

843
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,700
Thanks for coming.

844
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:27,700
Of course.

845
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,400
How are you?

846
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,600
You ok about the other night?

847
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,600
I just feel bad about leaving Aunt May.

848
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:36,800
Have you talked to Harry?

849
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,000
He called me.

850
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I haven't called him back.

851
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:47,100
The fact is, I'm in love with somebody else.

852
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:48,900
You are?

853
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:52,600
At least, I think I am.

854
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:54,100
It's not the right time to talk about it.

855
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:58,100
No, no, go on. Would I know his name, this guy?

856
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,600
You'll think I'm a stupid little girl with a crush.

857
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,500
Trust me.

858
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:07,600
It's funny. 

859
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:11,300
He saved my life twice and I've never even seen his face.

860
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:14,000
Oh him.

861
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,100
You're laughing at me.

862
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:18,500
No, no I understand.

863
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:19,700
He is extremely cool.

864
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:21,400
But do you think it's true all the terrible things they say about him?

865
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:25,400
No, no, not Spiderman, not a chance in the world.

866
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:29,700
I know him a little bit, I'm sort of his unofficial photographer.

867
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,100
Has he mentioned me.

868
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:34,200
Yeah.

869
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,800
What'd he say?

870
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:38,700
I said...

871
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:42,700
he he asked me what I thought about you.

872
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:47,500
And what did you say?

873
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:50,800
I said...

874
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,900
uh, Spiderman, I said, 

875
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:57,900
the great thing about MJ is 

876
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:02,800
that when you look in her eyes

877
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:08,500
and she's looking back in yours 

878
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:12,700
everything feels 

879
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:15,900
not quite normal

880
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:18,200
because you feel 

881
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:21,500
stronger 

882
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:25,500
and weaker at the same time

883
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:29,400
you feel excited 

884
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:31,800
and at the same time 

885
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:35,800
terrified.

886
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:40,200
The truth is, you don't know what you feel, 

887
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,600
except to know the kind of man you want to be.

888
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:50,200
It's as if you've 

889
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:54,200
reached the unreachable...

890
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:58,400
And you weren't ready for it.

891
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:04,100
You said that?

892
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:08,100
Well, something like that.

893
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:40,600
Hey.

894
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:54,300
Dad?

895
01:36:56,900 --> 01:37:00,900
Dad is that you?

896
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:09,500
What is it?

897
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,900
Well, you were right about MJ.

898
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:15,500
You were right about everything.

899
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:19,500
She's in love with Peter.

900
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:25,100
Parker. And how does he feel about her.

901
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:28,500
Well, he's loved her since the fourth grade.

902
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:32,500
He pretends like he doesn't but there's no one Peter cares for more.

903
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:40,600
I'm so sorry.

904
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I haven't always been there for you have I?

905
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:50,100
You're busy. You're an important man, I understand.

906
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:52,400
That's no excuse.

907
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,700
I'm proud of you.

908
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:58,700
And I've lost sight of that somewhere but I'm going to make it up to you Harry.

909
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:03,600
I'm going to rectify certain inequities.

910
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Wake up little spider. Wake up.

911
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:26,100
Go home dear. You look awful.

912
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:28,100
You look beautiful.

913
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:29,100
I don't like to leave you here.

914
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:31,100
Oh but I'm safe here.

915
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:32,600
Can I do anything for you?

916
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:36,600
You do too much. College, a job, all this time with me.

917
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:40,500
You're not Superman you know.

918
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,400
A smile.

919
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:45,400
Finally, I haven't seen one of those on your face since Mary Jane was here.

920
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:49,500
Hey, you were supposed to be asleep.

921
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:53,500
You know, you were about six years old when MJ's family moved in next door.

922
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:58,500
And when she got out of the car and you saw her for the first time

923
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,000
you grabbed me and said, 

924
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
"Aunt May, Aunt May is that an angel?"

925
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,300
Did I say that?

926
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:11,300
You sure did.

927
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:15,500
Well, Harry's in love with her.  She's still his girl.

928
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,500
Isn't that up to her?

929
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:21,200
She doesn't really know who I am.

930
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:25,200
Because you won't let her.  You're so mysterious all the time.

931
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:33,800
Tell me, would it be so dangerous to let Mary Jane know how much you care?

932
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:37,800
Everybody else knows.

933
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:43,500
I'll be right back.

934
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,900
Oh come on pick up.

935
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:55,400
Hi it's me sing your song at the beep. [beep]

936
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:59,400
Hi MJ, it's Peter. Are you there. 

937
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,400
Well, I'm just calling to check up on you.

938
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,600
Will you call me when you get in ok? 

939
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:10,600
Alright, well ... don't, don't go up any dark alleys.

940
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,200
Hello?

941
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:16,700
Ha ha ha ha ha. 

942
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:20,500
Can Spiderman come out to play?

943
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:24,500
Where is she?

944
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:14,700
Itsy bitsy Spider went up the water spout,

945
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,000
down came the Goblin and took the Spider out.

946
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:23,700
Ha ha ha ha...

947
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:40,200
Goblin, what have you done?

948
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:21,200
Spiderman! 

949
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:24,700
This is why only fools are heroes.

950
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:32,400
Because you never know when some lunatic will come along with a sadistic choice.

951
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:36,400
Let die the woman you love,

952
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:45,500
or .. suffer the little children.

953
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:55,000
Make your choice Spiderman!

954
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,500
And see how a hero is rewarded.

955
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:00,600
Don't do it Goblin!

956
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:04,600
We are who we choose to be.
Now choose!

957
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:39,500
Everyone stay still.

958
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:46,100
Aghh...

959
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:50,100
Ahoy up there! We're going to bring the barge right under you.

960
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:00,200
Aiiee, he's coming back!

961
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:04,100
Listen, I need you to climb down.

962
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:08,100
-I can't!
-Yes you can!

963
01:44:09,300 --> 01:44:12,300
MJ, you can do it.  You have to.

964
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:15,500
Trust me.

965
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:19,500
Hold on tight. Go quickly.

966
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,000
Hurry!

967
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,100
I can't I can't do it.

968
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:31,100
Hang on Mary Jane!

969
01:44:56,100 --> 01:45:00,100
-He's not gonna make it.
-He's gonna make it.

970
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:12,400
It's time to die!

971
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,500
Come on up here dumb guy I got a little something for ya.

972
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:26,500
Leave Spiderman alone.  You gonna pick on a guy trying to save a bunch of kids?

973
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:30,600
You mess with Spidey you mess with New York.

974
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:34,600
You mess with one of us you mess with all of us.

975
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:50,900
Spiderman watch out!

976
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:22,500
Misery. Misery. Misery.

977
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:25,100
That's what you've chosen.

978
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:29,100
I offered you friendship and you spat in my face.

979
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:25,100
You've spun your last web Spiderman.

980
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:29,900
Had you not been so selfish, your little
girlfriend's death would have been quick and painless

981
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:33,600
but now you've really pissed me off 

982
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,600
I'm going to finish her nice and slow.

983
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:46,100
MJ and I 

984
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:50,100
we're going to have a hell of a time!

985
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:47,800
Peter! Stop! Stop.. It's me.

986
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,600
Mr. Osbourne.

987
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:00,400
Peter, thank God for you.

988
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,300
You killed those people on that balcony.

989
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:05,000
The Goblin killed them, I had nothing to do with it!

990
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,300
Don't, don't let him take me again!

991
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:11,700
Help me. Protect me!

992
01:49:11,700 --> 01:49:13,800
You tried to kill Aunt May. You tried to kill Mary Jane.

993
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:17,500
But not you. I tried to stop it. 

994
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:21,500
I couldn't stop it. I would never hurt you.

995
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:26,100
I knew from the beginning, if anything ever happened to me

996
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:30,300
It was you that I could count on

997
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:33,700
you Peter Parker would save me and so you have.

998
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:37,700
Thank God for you.

999
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:42,200
Give me your hand. Believe in me. As I believed in you.

1000
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:48,000
I've been like a father to you.

1001
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,700
Be a son to me now.

1002
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:54,300
I have a father.

1003
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:58,300
His name was Ben Parker.

1004
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:02,600
Godspeed Spiderman.

1005
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Oh.

1006
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:26,800
Don't tell Harry.

1007
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:00,600
What have you done? What have you done?!

1008
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:27,300
Hey.

1009
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,900
I'm so sorry man.

1010
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:34,900
I know what it's like to lose a father.

1011
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:40,300
I didn't lose him. He was stolen from me.

1012
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:45,200
One day Spiderman will pay.

1013
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:49,400
I swear on my father's grave, Spiderman will pay.

1014
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:57,700
Thank God for you Peter, you're the only family I have.

1015
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:26,900
No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, 

1016
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:33,000
the ones I love, will always be the ones who pay.

1017
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:47,200
You must miss him so much.

1018
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:51,200
It's been so hard without him.

1019
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:57,000
There's something I've been wanting to tell you.

1020
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:00,200
When I was up there, 

1021
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:04,200
and I thought I was going to die,

1022
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:08,400
there's only one person who I was thinking of.

1023
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:13,900
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1024
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:17,800
It was you Pete.

1025
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:21,800
I kept thinking, "I hope I make it through this,

1026
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:28,200
so I could see Peter Parker's face one more time."

1027
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:32,000
Really?

1028
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:36,000
There's only one man who's always been there for me.

1029
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:43,100
Who makes me feel like I'm more than I ever thought I could be.

1030
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:51,300
That I'm just, me, 

1031
01:53:52,100 --> 01:53:56,100
and that's ok.

1032
01:53:56,600 --> 01:54:00,600
The truth is ... I love you.

1033
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:06,800
I love you so much Peter.

1034
01:54:26,500 --> 01:54:30,500
All I wanted was to tell her how much I loved her...

1035
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:35,500
I can't.

1036
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:38,300
You can't what?

1037
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:41,400
Tell you, 

1038
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:44,000
everything I mean.

1039
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,300
There's so much to tell.

1040
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:51,300
Yeah, there's so much to tell.

1041
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:55,400
I want you to know that I will always be there for you.

1042
01:54:57,300 --> 01:55:01,300
I will always be there to take care of you.

1043
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:05,800
I promise you that.

1044
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:11,300
I will always be your friend.

1045
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:16,300
Only a friend, Peter Parker?

1046
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:23,000
That's all I have to give.

1047
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Whatever life holds in store for me, 

1048
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I will never forget these words, 

1049
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,000
'With great power comes great responsibility.'

1050
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
This is my gift, my curse.

1051
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,500
Who am I?

1052
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:10,500
I'm Spiderman.
