OK. Let's point the dish

embedded in the satellite feed.

And that's the good news?

300
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:34,830
Yeah, 'cause this signal

301

has a definite
sequential pattern,

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,829
so as soon as I find
the exact binary sequence,

303
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:39,835
then I can calculate
the phase reversal

304
00:14:39,937 --> 00:14:40,926
with that analyzer

I built you for your
birthday and apply it,

we should be able to
block it out completely.

This unexplained disturbance

not to panic.

atmospheric phenomenon.

what has been causing

417

all the distortions
in our broadcasts.

of cold fear.

I got a lock on the pattern
of that signal,

426
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:21,443
so we can filter it out.

But if my calculations
are right,

428
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,719
it's going to be gone in,
like, seven hours anyway.

429

every time it recycles,

it's gonna disappear...

David. How did you
get this number?

Do me a favor.
Walk to the window.

986

an amazing moment.

We're reporting from

to communicate
with the visitors,

998

Pentagon officials

have retrofit
this skylift helicopter

Echo One
right beside you.

1014

This is something

1015
00:43:15,818 --> 00:43:16,716
I would never believe
in my lifetime,

1016
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:18,286
that I would be
in the White House.

1017

Look at this.

1018

If I knew I was going
to meet the president,

1019
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,453
I would have
worn a tie.

1020

I mean, look at me.
I look like a schlemiel.

You look fine, Pops.

Oy, my God.

00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,793
David, I don't know how happy
he's going to be to see you.

1024
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,992
That's right.
I'm telling you,

1025
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:32,999
we're wasting time.

1026
00:43:33,102 --> 00:43:34,000
He's not going
to listen to me.

1027
00:43:34,103 --> 00:43:35,001
We should go.

1028
00:43:35,104 --> 00:43:36,002
Why wouldn't
he listen?

1029
00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:37,003
'Cause last time
I saw him,

1030
00:43:37,106 --> 00:43:38,004
we, uh, we got
into a fight.

1031
00:43:38,107 --> 00:43:39,005
You walked in the room

1032
00:43:39,108 --> 00:43:40,006
and punched him in the head.

1033
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:41,133
You punched
the president?

1034
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,369
He wasn't
the president then.

1035
00:43:42,478 --> 00:43:44,343
I punched him,
he fought back.

1036
00:43:44,446 --> 00:43:45,845
We wrestled around.
It was a fight.

1037
00:43:45,948 --> 00:43:47,040
A fight
that you started,

1038
00:43:47,149 --> 00:43:48,116
because David thought that
I was having an affair.

1039
00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:49,151
With the president?

1040
00:43:49,218 --> 00:43:50,185
Which, of course,
I wasn't.

1041
00:43:51,603 --> 00:43:52,729
You know, either
go get him,

1042
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,930
or we should head
back to the car.

1043
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:55,563
All right. I'll get him.
You wait here,

1044
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,198
and don't touch anything.

1045
00:43:57,309 --> 00:43:59,573
You punched the president?

1046
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,270

Um...

1081
00:45:20,524 --> 00:45:23,891
Let's say that you want to

You're talking about

Yeah, that's right.
Exactly.

The curve of the Earth
prevents it.

1087
00:45:35,005 --> 00:45:36,302
You'd need satellites

Jesus.

1303
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:20,902
They got another one, sir.
Two more just went down.

1304
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:22,136
They're dropping
like flies.

1305
01:02:22,245 --> 01:02:23,303
We're losing them.

1306
01:02:23,413 --> 01:02:25,176
All right. Get them
out of there.

1307
01:02:25,281 --> 01:02:27,374
Squadron leaders, retreat
to fallback positions.

1308
01:02:27,484 --> 01:02:29,315
Abort mission right away.
Do you read me?

1309
01:02:29,419 --> 01:02:30,317
Do you copy?

1310
01:02:33,756 --> 01:02:35,986
We're going to have to make
a run for this one here.

1311
01:02:36,092 --> 01:02:37,320
Let's get low.
Let's get fast.

1312
01:02:37,427 --> 01:02:39,452
I got you, big daddy.
Let's get them.

1313
01:02:39,562 --> 01:02:40,790
Whoo!

1314
01:02:41,998 --> 01:02:42,896
Watch the deck.

1315
01:02:51,641 --> 01:02:53,472
Squadron Leader,
do you read?

1316
01:02:53,576 --> 01:02:55,441
This isn't happening
fast enough.

1317
01:02:55,545 --> 01:02:56,569
Get them out of there!

1318
01:03:03,386 --> 01:03:05,616
What's with the monitor?
Where's the picture?

1319
01:03:05,722 --> 01:03:06,780
We've lost
the satellite.

1320
01:03:10,927 --> 01:03:13,122
Steven: We got two R-6,
Jimmy. Check them.

Roger.

1322
01:03:15,999 --> 01:03:17,796
Come on, come on.
Move, move, move!

1323
01:03:19,202 --> 01:03:20,897
He's on me like white
on rice, big daddy.

1324
01:03:21,004 --> 01:03:21,971
They ain't got
nothing for us.

1325
01:03:22,071 --> 01:03:23,732
Let's push it.
We've got to go.

1326
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,569
I can't shake him.
I can't shake him.

1327
01:03:25,675 --> 01:03:27,108
Yes, you can.
Just the way I showed you.

1328
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:29,269
Check me out. I'm going
to try something.

1329
01:03:29,379 --> 01:03:30,812
Don't do nothing stupid
over there.

1330
01:03:30,914 --> 01:03:31,812
You know me.

1331
01:03:31,915 --> 01:03:33,382
That's what
I'm talking about.

1332
01:03:33,483 --> 01:03:35,781
Jimmy, what are you doing?
You can't bank at that speed.

1333
01:03:36,986 --> 01:03:37,884
Jimmy, he's closing on you!

1334
01:03:41,658 --> 01:03:43,558
Put your mask back on!
That's an order!

1335
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,888
I can't breathe!

Jimmy!

1338
01:03:52,535 --> 01:03:53,934
Jimmy! No!

1339
01:03:54,037 --> 01:03:55,629
That's affirmative.
We have incoming.

1340
01:03:55,738 --> 01:03:56,636
Let me have it, son.

1341
01:03:56,739 --> 01:03:58,570
You got it.

1342
01:03:58,675 --> 01:04:00,768
Friendly?

1343
01:04:00,877 --> 01:04:02,139
Sergeant?

1344
01:04:02,245 --> 01:04:03,610
I don't think so.

[Alarm Sounds]

Go! Go! Go! Go!

1347
01:04:31,741 --> 01:04:33,140
Come on and get me!
Come and get me!

1348
01:04:37,013 --> 01:04:38,913
Oh, what are you
shooting at?

1349
01:04:40,183 --> 01:04:42,811
Where you at, baby?
Come on! Come on!

1350
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:49,485
Aw, you can't hit nothing!

1351
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,830
Aah!

1352
01:04:55,932 --> 01:04:57,524
Ha! Ha!

1353
01:05:06,676 --> 01:05:08,576
Whoa! Low bridge!

1354
01:05:12,982 --> 01:05:14,813
See if you can fly
that thing undercover.

1355
01:05:18,488 --> 01:05:21,321
Ha ha. Hope you got
an air bag.

1356
01:05:23,192 --> 01:05:24,352
Whoa!

1357

Son of a bitch.

Aah!

That's right!
That's right!

1363

Get off of me!
Get off of me!

1364
01:06:08,938 --> 01:06:10,405
That's what you get!

1365
01:06:10,506 --> 01:06:12,474
Ha ha!
Look at you!

1366
01:06:12,575 --> 01:06:14,133
Ship all banged up!

1367
01:06:14,243 --> 01:06:15,540
Who's the man?

1368
01:06:15,645 --> 01:06:17,237
Huh? Who's the man?

1369
01:06:17,346 --> 01:06:18,779
Wait until I get
another plane!

1370
01:06:18,881 --> 01:06:21,372
I'm lining all your friends
up right beside you!

1371
01:06:22,952 --> 01:06:24,249
Where you at, huh?

1372
01:06:24,353 --> 01:06:25,684
Huh? Where you at?

1373
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,625
Welcome to Earth.

1374
01:06:49,812 --> 01:06:52,804
Now, that's what I call
a close encounter.

1375
01:06:57,086 --> 01:06:57,984
Baby,
stay right here.

1376
01:06:58,087 --> 01:06:59,645
Stay right here
with Boomer.

Yes!

Come on, baby.
Come on.

Come on.

01:07:16,272 --> 01:07:17,239
Yes!

Radio: Reports indicate
that this battle

with the exact
same results.

1386

You're just like your
mother, you know that?

1387
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:29,137
She was stubborn, too.

1388
01:07:29,242 --> 01:07:31,142
Had to twist her arm

1389
01:07:31,244 --> 01:07:33,644
to get her
to take her medicine.

1390

You're gonna
be all right.

1391
01:07:35,882 --> 01:07:36,940
You're gonna be fine.

1392
01:07:39,452 --> 01:07:43,320
See, Troy? You're
feeling better already.

1393
01:07:43,423 --> 01:07:45,823
I couldn't find anything.

1394
01:07:45,926 --> 01:07:47,587
Everyone's packing up.
They're leaving.

1395
01:07:47,694 --> 01:07:49,685
They said there's a spaceship
heading this way.

1396
01:07:49,796 --> 01:07:51,229
We'd better leave,
too, then.

1397

[Knocking]

1398
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:54,131
Penicillin.

1399
01:07:54,234 --> 01:07:56,031
At least it'll help
keep his fever down.

1400
01:07:56,136 --> 01:07:57,034
Oh, thank you.

1401
01:07:57,137 --> 01:07:59,367
It's really nice
of you to help us.

1402
01:07:59,472 --> 01:08:01,906
I wish I could do more,
but we're moving out.

1403
01:08:02,008 --> 01:08:04,306
I-I'm going with you.

1404
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,080
Um...Well, I--I just--

1405
01:08:09,182 --> 01:08:11,412
I mean, that--that
we're going, too.

1406
01:08:11,518 --> 01:08:12,644
Cool.

1407
01:08:12,752 --> 01:08:15,846
Tell that punk to shut
the door. We're outta here.

1408
01:08:15,956 --> 01:08:17,389
Go sniff around
somewhere else.

1409

- Bye.
- Bye.

Uhh...

It's Air Force One,
for crying out loud.

1412
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,267
Still he gets sick.

1413
01:08:30,368 --> 01:08:32,427
Oh, boy.
I don't feel so good.

1414
01:08:32,537 --> 01:08:34,368
Look at me, huh?
Like a rock.

1415
01:08:34,472 --> 01:08:35,803
Could be bad weather,
could be good weather.

1416
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:36,965
It doesn't matter.

1417
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:38,406
We could go up.
We could go down.

1418
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:40,273
We can go back.
We can go forward.

1419
01:08:40,378 --> 01:08:41,504
We can go
side to side--

1420
01:08:44,716 --> 01:08:45,614
What'd I say?

1421
01:08:47,852 --> 01:08:49,945
He still
gets airsick, huh?

1422
01:08:50,055 --> 01:08:51,488
Yeah.

1423
01:08:51,589 --> 01:08:54,820
Julius, with
all of this, I, uh...

1424
01:08:54,926 --> 01:08:58,362
I didn't get a chance
to thank you two.

1425
01:08:58,463 --> 01:09:00,693
All he could think of
was getting to you.

1426
01:09:03,568 --> 01:09:05,798
There's still love there,
I think.

1427
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,305
Love was never
our problem.

1428
01:09:10,408 --> 01:09:13,275
" All you need is love."

1429
01:09:13,378 --> 01:09:14,436
John Lennon.

1430
01:09:14,546 --> 01:09:15,604
Smart man.

1431
01:09:15,714 --> 01:09:17,648
Shot in the back.
Very sad.

1432
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:20,884
We've moved
as many of our forces

1433
01:09:20,985 --> 01:09:22,646
away from our bases
as possible,

1434
01:09:22,754 --> 01:09:25,154
but we've already
sustained heavy losses.

1435
01:09:25,256 --> 01:09:27,156
I spoke with the joint chiefs
when they arrived at NORAD.

1436
01:09:27,258 --> 01:09:29,749
They agree we must launch
a counteroffensive

1437
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:31,590
with a full
nuclear strike.

1438
01:09:31,696 --> 01:09:33,220
Over American soil?

1439
01:09:33,331 --> 01:09:34,389
You're saying,
at this point,

1440
01:09:34,499 --> 01:09:35,727
we should sacrifice
more innocent

1441
01:09:35,834 --> 01:09:37,734
American civilians?
Is that right?

1442
01:09:37,836 --> 01:09:39,133
Sir, if we don't
strike soon

1443
01:09:39,237 --> 01:09:41,102
there may not be much
of an America left to defend.

1444
01:09:41,206 --> 01:09:43,174
Sir, they've
taken out NORAD.

1445
01:09:43,274 --> 01:09:44,172
What?

1446
01:09:44,275 --> 01:09:45,299
It's gone, sir.

1447
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:47,241
My God.

1448
01:09:47,345 --> 01:09:49,813
The vice president,
joint chiefs.

1449
01:09:49,914 --> 01:09:52,382
Mr. President,

1450
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:53,974
we must launch.

1451
01:09:54,085 --> 01:09:55,677
A delay now
would be more costly

1452
01:09:55,787 --> 01:09:58,654
than when you waited
to evacuate the cities.

1453
01:09:58,757 --> 01:10:00,281
No, no. You're not going
to launch nuclear weapons.

1454
01:10:00,391 --> 01:10:02,450
You're going to kill them
and us at the same time.

1455
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,959
If we fire nukes,

1456
01:10:04,062 --> 01:10:04,960
then everybody else
is going to fire them.

1457
01:10:05,063 --> 01:10:06,030
You are a guest here.

1458
01:10:06,131 --> 01:10:07,029
Ever hear of
nuclear winter?

1459
01:10:07,132 --> 01:10:08,929
It's the end of life
as we know it.

1460
01:10:09,033 --> 01:10:09,931
Do you hear what
they're talking about?

1461
01:10:10,034 --> 01:10:10,932
Don't even think
about it.

1462
01:10:11,035 --> 01:10:12,059
I don't have to go.

1463
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,102
It can't be allowed.

1464
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:14,933
Shut up! Captain,
get him out of here!

1465
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,165
Hey, don't tell him
to shut up!

1466
01:10:18,276 --> 01:10:21,541
You'd all be dead now
if it wasn't for my David.

1467
01:10:21,646 --> 01:10:23,273
None of you did anything
to prevent this.

1468
01:10:23,381 --> 01:10:24,678
There was nothing
we could do.

1469
01:10:24,783 --> 01:10:27,115
We were totally
unprepared for this.

1470
01:10:27,218 --> 01:10:28,583
Aw! Don't give me
unprepared.

1471
01:10:28,686 --> 01:10:29,675
Come on,Julius.

1472
01:10:29,788 --> 01:10:32,655
It was in the 1950s.
You had that spaceship.

1473
01:10:32,757 --> 01:10:34,156
David: Dad.

1474
01:10:34,259 --> 01:10:37,023
Julius: Yeah, that thing
that you found in New Mexico.

1475
01:10:37,128 --> 01:10:39,323
Dad, no.
Not the spaceship.

1476
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:40,692
Roswell.
Roswell, New Mexico. Yeah.

1477
01:10:40,799 --> 01:10:43,267
You had the spaceship,
and you had the bodies.

1478
01:10:43,368 --> 01:10:44,426
They were all
locked up in a bunker.

1479
01:10:44,536 --> 01:10:45,696
Where was that?

1480
01:10:45,804 --> 01:10:48,398
David?
In Area 51, right?

1481
01:10:48,506 --> 01:10:49,905
Area 51.

1482
01:10:50,008 --> 01:10:51,839
You knew then,
and you did nothing.

1483
01:10:53,378 --> 01:10:54,777
Sir, regardless of what

1484
01:10:54,879 --> 01:10:58,007
you may have read
in the tabloids,

1485
01:10:58,116 --> 01:11:00,175
there have never been
any spacecraft

1486
01:11:00,285 --> 01:11:02,116
recovered
by our government.

1487
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,950
Take my word for it,
there's no Area 51.

1488
01:11:05,056 --> 01:11:06,990
There's no
recovered spaceship.

1489
01:11:07,091 --> 01:11:10,219
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. President?

1490
01:11:10,328 --> 01:11:14,230
That's not
entirely accurate.

1491
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:21,800
What? Which part?

1492
01:11:27,044 --> 01:11:29,410
Hold on, everybody!
Hold on!

1493
01:11:30,647 --> 01:11:32,342
Sorry.

1494
01:11:50,033 --> 01:11:51,967
The end hath come!

1495
01:11:52,069 --> 01:11:55,630
He spaketh His word,
and the end hath come!

1496
01:11:55,739 --> 01:11:56,637
Hop on!

1497
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:59,072
We're heading out
to El Toro.

1498
01:11:59,176 --> 01:12:02,873
You cannot defy
what hath come.

1499
01:12:02,979 --> 01:12:04,503
It is the end!

1500
01:12:04,614 --> 01:12:05,774
[Sobbing]

1501
01:12:10,153 --> 01:12:12,314
El Toro?!

1502
01:12:18,544 --> 01:12:20,444
Jasmine: Can you
give me a hand?

1503
01:12:20,546 --> 01:12:21,604
Yeah, sure.

1504
01:12:29,589 --> 01:12:30,556
Oh, my God.

1505
01:12:34,727 --> 01:12:37,457
[Boomer Barks]

1506
01:12:37,563 --> 01:12:39,690
OK, OK. Let's--
Let's get this off.

1507
01:12:39,799 --> 01:12:41,426
Here. Let me help you.

1508
01:12:45,238 --> 01:12:47,138
She's hurt
pretty badly.

1509
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:55,570
You know, this was supposed
to be my weekend off.

1510
01:12:55,682 --> 01:12:57,980
But no.

1511
01:12:58,084 --> 01:13:01,019
You got me out here
dragging your heavy ass

1512
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,644
through
the burning desert,

1513
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:04,154
with your dreadlocks

1514
01:13:04,257 --> 01:13:05,485
sticking out the back
of my parachute.

1515
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:08,492
You've got to come down here
with an attitude,

1516
01:13:08,594 --> 01:13:10,653
acting all big and bad.

1517
01:13:12,799 --> 01:13:15,962
And what the hell
is that smell?!

1518
01:13:16,069 --> 01:13:17,832
Aah!

1519
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:21,197
I could've been
at a barbecue!

1520
01:13:22,976 --> 01:13:24,170
But I ain't mad.

1521
01:13:24,277 --> 01:13:26,211
It's all right.

1522
01:13:26,312 --> 01:13:27,802
That is all right.

1523
01:13:43,029 --> 01:13:44,189
Hey!

1524
01:13:44,297 --> 01:13:46,162
Hey!

1525
01:13:46,265 --> 01:13:47,163
Hey!

1526
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:53,671
Hey!

1527
01:14:06,753 --> 01:14:08,914
You need a lift,
soldier?

1528
01:14:09,022 --> 01:14:10,387
When I flew overhead,

1529
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:12,014
I saw a base
not too far from here.

1530
01:14:15,261 --> 01:14:16,250
It ain't on the map.

1531
01:14:16,362 --> 01:14:19,559
Trust me. It's there.

1532
01:14:35,181 --> 01:14:36,375
Ten-hut!

1533
01:14:40,286 --> 01:14:42,550
Mr. President.
General.

1534
01:14:42,655 --> 01:14:44,384
Welcome to Area 51.

1535
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:45,514
Please follow me.

1536
01:14:47,427 --> 01:14:49,622
We're now 2 4 floors
beneath the surface,

1537
01:14:49,729 --> 01:14:52,562
and here's our main
research facility.

1538
01:14:52,665 --> 01:14:53,654
Let's see it.

1539
01:14:53,766 --> 01:14:54,755
I'm sorry, sir.
It's a clean room.

1540
01:14:54,867 --> 01:14:56,129
We have to keep it
static-free.

1541
01:14:56,235 --> 01:14:57,167
If we'll all
go to decontamination--

1542
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:59,500
Open the door.

1543
01:15:01,474 --> 01:15:02,634
Yes, sir.

1544
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:27,258
My God. Why the hell wasn't
I told about this place?

1545
01:15:27,366 --> 01:15:28,924
Two words,
Mr. President:

1546
01:15:29,035 --> 01:15:31,902
plausible
deniability.

1547
01:15:38,411 --> 01:15:39,969
I don't understand.

1548
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:41,478
Where does all this
come from?

1549
01:15:41,581 --> 01:15:43,981
How do you get funding
for something like this?

1550
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:45,482
You don't actually think

1551
01:15:45,585 --> 01:15:46,882
they spend $20,000
on a hammer,

1552
01:15:46,986 --> 01:15:49,454
$30,000 on a toilet seat,
do you?

1553
01:15:51,591 --> 01:15:54,082
Mr. President,
this is Dr. Okun.

1554
01:15:54,193 --> 01:15:55,353
He's been heading up
the research department

1555
01:15:55,461 --> 01:15:57,520
on this project
for the last 15 years.

1556
01:15:59,799 --> 01:16:01,266
How do you do.

1557
01:16:01,367 --> 01:16:04,165
Mr. President.

1558
01:16:04,270 --> 01:16:06,431
Wow.

1559
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:10,339
This--
What a pleasure.

1560
01:16:10,443 --> 01:16:12,206
As you can imagine,

1561
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:13,972
they don't let us
out much.

1562
01:16:15,581 --> 01:16:17,344
I can understand that.

1563
01:16:19,252 --> 01:16:22,153
Well, I guess
you'd like to see

1564
01:16:22,255 --> 01:16:24,246
the big tamale, huh?

1565
01:16:24,357 --> 01:16:25,722
Follow me.

1566
01:16:35,201 --> 01:16:37,101
[Assistant
Enters Code]

1567
01:17:16,475 --> 01:17:18,875
She's a beaut,
ain't she?

1568
01:17:21,314 --> 01:17:22,303
Dr. Okun: As you can see
from the repairs,

1569
01:17:22,415 --> 01:17:24,110
we've been trying
to put her back together

1570
01:17:24,217 --> 01:17:26,617
since the late 1960s.

1571
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:27,777
Don't tell me

1572
01:17:27,887 --> 01:17:28,819
you've had this
for 40 years,

1573
01:17:28,921 --> 01:17:29,819
and you don't know
anything about them?

1574
01:17:29,922 --> 01:17:31,116
Oh, hell, no. No, no.

1575
01:17:31,224 --> 01:17:33,351
We know tons about them.

1576
01:17:33,459 --> 01:17:35,256
But the neatest stuff--
the neatest stuff

1577
01:17:35,361 --> 01:17:39,229
has only happened
in the last few days.

1578
01:17:39,332 --> 01:17:41,664
See, we can't duplicate
their type of power,

1579
01:17:41,767 --> 01:17:44,133
so we've never been able
to experiment.

1580
01:17:44,237 --> 01:17:45,602
But since these guys
started showing up,

1581
01:17:45,705 --> 01:17:50,039
all the little gizmos
inside turned on.

1582
01:17:50,142 --> 01:17:53,043
The last 2 4 hours have
been really exciting.

1583
01:17:53,145 --> 01:17:55,511
Exciting?
People are dying out there.

1584
01:17:55,615 --> 01:17:56,980
I don't think " exciting"

1585
01:17:57,083 --> 01:18:00,018
is the word I'd choose
to describe it.

1586
01:18:00,119 --> 01:18:02,212
You guys are hoping
to fly this thing, huh?

1587
01:18:02,321 --> 01:18:04,653
You said you can repair
their technology.

1588
01:18:04,757 --> 01:18:06,520
Can you tell us anything
useful about them?

1589
01:18:06,626 --> 01:18:08,116
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1590
01:18:08,227 --> 01:18:09,626
Well, I mean,

1591
01:18:09,729 --> 01:18:11,663
they're not all that
dissimilar from us.

1592
01:18:11,764 --> 01:18:13,698
Breathes oxygen.

1593
01:18:13,799 --> 01:18:16,063
Comparable tolerances
to heat, cold.

1594
01:18:16,168 --> 01:18:17,567
Probably why
they're interested

1595
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:19,865
in our planet.

1596
01:18:19,972 --> 01:18:21,496
Hey.

1597
01:18:21,607 --> 01:18:22,505
Hey.

1598
01:18:24,977 --> 01:18:26,239
You guys
want to see them?

1599
01:18:27,647 --> 01:18:29,274
Hmm?

1600
01:18:36,155 --> 01:18:40,182
This is--
This is the vault,

1601
01:18:40,293 --> 01:18:43,922
or as some of us have
come to call it,

1602
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:44,962
" The Freak Show."

1603
01:18:45,064 --> 01:18:47,430
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1604
01:18:47,533 --> 01:18:48,431
" The--"

1605
01:19:07,687 --> 01:19:09,780
When we found them,

1606
01:19:09,889 --> 01:19:13,825
they were wearing some sort
of biomechanical suits,

1607
01:19:13,926 --> 01:19:14,915
but once we got them off,

1608
01:19:15,027 --> 01:19:17,154
we learned a great deal
about their anatomy.

1609
01:19:17,263 --> 01:19:20,824
Eyes, ears,
no vocal chords.

1610
01:19:20,933 --> 01:19:22,958
We're assuming they
communicate with each other

1611
01:19:23,069 --> 01:19:24,832
through some other means.

1612
01:19:24,937 --> 01:19:25,995
You're obviously
not thinking about

1613
01:19:26,105 --> 01:19:28,335
hand signals
and body language.

1614
01:19:28,441 --> 01:19:29,339
It's
some kind of

1615
01:19:29,442 --> 01:19:31,273
extrasensory
perception.

1616
01:19:31,377 --> 01:19:32,708
Telepathy.

1617
01:19:34,013 --> 01:19:34,980
So...

1618
01:19:37,183 --> 01:19:39,310
It's an organic life form.

1619
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,312
Can they be killed?

1620
01:19:44,423 --> 01:19:46,084
Their bodies are
just as frail as ours.

1621
01:19:46,192 --> 01:19:48,285
These two
died in the crash.

1622
01:19:48,394 --> 01:19:50,726
This one,
a few weeks later.

1623
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:51,854
You just--

1624
01:19:51,964 --> 01:19:53,989
You have to get through
their technology,

1625
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,967
which is,
I'm sorry to say,

1626
01:19:57,069 --> 01:19:58,229
far more advanced.

1627
01:19:59,572 --> 01:20:03,099
David, you unlocked
part of that technology.

1628
01:20:03,209 --> 01:20:04,233
You cracked the code.

1629
01:20:04,343 --> 01:20:05,275
Oh, no, no.

1630
01:20:05,378 --> 01:20:07,903
All I did was stumble
onto their signal.

1631
01:20:08,013 --> 01:20:10,982
I don't know
how helpful I can be.

1632
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:15,110
Why don't you show them
what you've discovered so far,

1633
01:20:15,221 --> 01:20:18,554
figure out what they haven't
thought of yet,

1634
01:20:18,657 --> 01:20:20,056
and we'll see

1635
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,356
if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.

1636
01:20:33,372 --> 01:20:34,771
What code?

1637
01:20:54,927 --> 01:20:56,053
Captain Steven Hiller,

1638
01:20:56,162 --> 01:20:57,220
United States
Marine Corps.

1639
01:20:57,329 --> 01:20:59,490
I'm sorry, Captain.
This is a restricted area.

1640
01:20:59,598 --> 01:21:00,929
I can't let you pass
without clearance.

1641
01:21:01,033 --> 01:21:04,025
OK. Come here.

1642
01:21:04,136 --> 01:21:05,831
You want to see
my clearance?

1643
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:10,401
Maybe I'll just leave
this here with you.

1644
01:21:10,476 --> 01:21:11,443
Let them pass.

1645
01:21:12,859 --> 01:21:13,689
Let them pass.

1646
01:21:13,794 --> 01:21:15,989
Get the hell
out of the way.

1647
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:19,063
Did you see that?

1648
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:19,266
Come on down.

1649
01:21:19,266 --> 01:21:20,824
Come on down.

1650
01:21:22,235 --> 01:21:23,133
Watch your step.

1651
01:21:24,805 --> 01:21:28,639
Well, obviously, this cockpit
was designed to seat three,

1652
01:21:28,742 --> 01:21:31,233
though how they sat on that,
I don't know.

1653
01:21:31,344 --> 01:21:32,242
David: Gently.

1654
01:21:32,345 --> 01:21:34,870
Uh, you see
these gizmos flashing?

1655
01:21:34,981 --> 01:21:35,879
Yeah.

1656
01:21:35,982 --> 01:21:37,210
We've been working
around the clock

1657
01:21:37,317 --> 01:21:39,217
trying to get a fix
on all this crap.

1658
01:21:39,319 --> 01:21:40,980
Some stuff we
figured out right away.

1659
01:21:41,087 --> 01:21:42,987
Uh, this,
we're pretty sure,

1660
01:21:43,089 --> 01:21:45,649
is the life support
system for the cabin.

1661
01:21:45,759 --> 01:21:47,192
[Coughs] And, uh,

1662
01:21:47,294 --> 01:21:49,319
this doohickey
is connected to--

1663
01:21:49,429 --> 01:21:52,159
Oh...Well, it was

1664
01:21:52,265 --> 01:21:53,527
connected
to the engine.

1665
01:21:53,633 --> 01:21:55,624
Here.
Take that, will ya?

1666
01:21:55,735 --> 01:21:59,364
Uh, these configurations,
uh...

1667
01:22:01,174 --> 01:22:02,607
Well, to be honest,

1668
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:06,076
we--we--we don't know
what the hell this crap is.

1669
01:22:06,179 --> 01:22:08,647
But this is
clearly what they use

1670
01:22:08,748 --> 01:22:11,273
to guide and navigate
their craft.

1671
01:22:11,384 --> 01:22:13,113
Ha ha. Neat, huh?

1672
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,279
That's very good.
Somebody grab my laptop there?

1673
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:18,983
Dr. Isaacs, can I just have
the computer inside there?

1674
01:22:19,092 --> 01:22:21,117
See these patterns here?
They're repeating sequentially,

1675
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:22,991
just like
their countdown signal.

1676
01:22:23,096 --> 01:22:25,326
They're using that frequency
for computer communications.

1677
01:22:25,432 --> 01:22:26,524
Huh?

1678
01:22:26,633 --> 01:22:28,794
See? That's how they're
coordinating their ships.

1679
01:22:28,902 --> 01:22:31,632
Huh. Ya know...

1680
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:34,263
you're really starting
to make us look bad.

1681
01:22:41,781 --> 01:22:43,408
They got one!

1682
01:22:43,516 --> 01:22:44,744
They got one alive!

1683
01:22:44,851 --> 01:22:46,011
They got one. Alive.

1684
01:22:46,119 --> 01:22:49,611
Jesus! Look, will you
be OK by yourself, Dave?

1685
01:22:49,723 --> 01:22:51,122
Fine, Dr. Okun.

1686
01:22:51,224 --> 01:22:52,657
Yeah--Uh, don't
touch anything.

1687
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,863
Why is he always telling me
not to touch anything?

1688
01:22:57,964 --> 01:23:00,125
Yeah. There.

1689
01:23:01,468 --> 01:23:03,629
Oh...that's why.

1690
01:23:12,012 --> 01:23:15,209
Right here. We got her
in the back of the pickup.

1691
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:20,878
How you doin', sir.

1692
01:23:20,987 --> 01:23:24,115
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

1693
01:23:24,224 --> 01:23:25,589
Guess who's comin'
to dinner.

1694
01:23:25,692 --> 01:23:28,456
I need a doctor!

1695
01:23:28,561 --> 01:23:30,426
I need a doctor!

1696
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:33,297
Oh, boy.

1697
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:34,298
Oh, boy.

1698
01:23:34,401 --> 01:23:35,299
How long has it been
unconscious?

1699
01:23:35,402 --> 01:23:36,300
About three hours.

1700
01:23:36,403 --> 01:23:37,370
Let's get him into
containment, stat.

1701
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:39,370
My son, he's very sick.

1702
01:23:39,472 --> 01:23:40,962
He needs immediate
attention.

1703
01:23:41,074 --> 01:23:41,972
He's drying out.

1704
01:23:42,075 --> 01:23:43,406
I want him sprayed
down with saline.

1705
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:45,637
He has a problem with his
adrenal cortex.

1706
01:23:45,745 --> 01:23:47,144
Please!

1707
01:23:50,216 --> 01:23:52,013
If you don't do something
about it right now,

1708
01:23:52,118 --> 01:23:53,016
my son will die!

1709
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:54,518
OK!Just help him!

1710
01:23:54,621 --> 01:23:57,454
OK. O'Haver, Miller,
you come with us.

1711
01:23:57,557 --> 01:23:59,115
You take us to him,
OK?

1712
01:23:59,225 --> 01:24:00,453
Let's go.

1713
01:24:02,495 --> 01:24:04,395
OK. Move it!
Move it! Move it!

1714
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:07,591
As the former head
of the C.I.A.,

1715
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:08,634
you knew about this place.

1716
01:24:10,351 --> 01:24:11,579
When were you planning on
informing the rest of us?

1717
01:24:11,685 --> 01:24:13,380
It had been deemed
classified.

1718
01:24:13,487 --> 01:24:14,886
You should have
told us about this

1719
01:24:14,988 --> 01:24:16,387
when they first arrived.

1720
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:17,889
You should have warned us

1721
01:24:17,991 --> 01:24:19,390
before we launched
a counterattack

1722
01:24:19,493 --> 01:24:22,223
that cost us the lives of
hundreds of American pilots!

1723
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:23,261
There was no way

1724
01:24:23,363 --> 01:24:24,227
we could have known
that our fighters

1725
01:24:24,331 --> 01:24:25,229
would have been
that ineffective

1726
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:26,264
against their attackers.

1727
01:24:26,366 --> 01:24:27,560
Mr. President.

1728
01:24:27,668 --> 01:24:30,000
Commander #2: The little bit
of information that we have

1729
01:24:30,104 --> 01:24:32,334
comes directly into
this room, Mr. President.

1730
01:24:32,439 --> 01:24:34,498
Atlanta, Chicago,
and Philadelphia...

1731
01:24:34,608 --> 01:24:35,836
destroyed.

1732
01:24:35,943 --> 01:24:37,501
We've learned that NATO

1733
01:24:37,611 --> 01:24:39,306
and Western Allied
Installations

1734
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:41,347
were the first
to be taken out.

1735
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:42,847
Then we were hit.

1736
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:46,113
They knew exactly
where and how to hit us.

1737
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:47,619
Whitmore:
And our forces?

1738
01:24:47,721 --> 01:24:49,621
General Grey:
We're down to 15%.

1739
01:24:49,723 --> 01:24:51,816
If you calculate
the time it takes

1740
01:24:51,925 --> 01:24:53,620
to destroy a city
and move on,

1741
01:24:53,727 --> 01:24:56,127
we're looking at
the worldwide destruction

1742
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:58,391
of every major city...

1743
01:24:58,499 --> 01:25:02,026
in the next 36 hours.

1744
01:25:03,137 --> 01:25:05,367
We're being exterminated.

1745
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:09,534
Mitchell:
Mr. President.

1746
01:25:10,711 --> 01:25:12,611
This is
Captain Steven Hiller.

1747
01:25:12,713 --> 01:25:13,611
Captain.

1748
01:25:13,714 --> 01:25:14,772
Mr. President.

1749
01:25:14,882 --> 01:25:15,780
Well done.

1750
01:25:15,883 --> 01:25:17,714
Where is it now?

1751
01:25:17,818 --> 01:25:19,217
We have it isolated

1752
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:20,718
down in the containment
lab, sir.

1753
01:25:20,821 --> 01:25:22,482
I'd like to go see it.

1754
01:25:28,095 --> 01:25:31,929
General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.

1755
01:25:33,967 --> 01:25:35,798
Hasn't anyone told you?

1756
01:25:38,872 --> 01:25:41,864
El Toro has been
completely destroyed.

1757
01:26:31,425 --> 01:26:33,120
Oh, no.

1758
01:26:34,228 --> 01:26:35,627
We were lucky.

1759
01:26:35,729 --> 01:26:36,718
[Chuckles]

1760
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:39,196
Today was the first time
I used the subway.

1761
01:26:39,299 --> 01:26:41,028
Thank God
for the metro rail.

1762
01:26:41,134 --> 01:26:42,726
These should last us
a while.

1763
01:26:42,836 --> 01:26:44,667
Don't move.
I'll get it for you.

1764
01:26:44,771 --> 01:26:46,398
Stay still.

1765
01:26:48,008 --> 01:26:50,476
He's your son?

1766
01:26:50,577 --> 01:26:52,204
He's my angel.

1767
01:26:52,312 --> 01:26:55,475
Was his father
stationed here?

1768
01:26:55,582 --> 01:26:57,982
Nah, he, uh...

1769
01:26:58,085 --> 01:26:59,985
he wasn't his father.

1770
01:27:00,087 --> 01:27:01,486
But I was kind of hoping

1771
01:27:01,588 --> 01:27:04,148
he wanted the job,
though.

1772
01:27:06,793 --> 01:27:09,353
So what do you do
for a living?

1773
01:27:09,463 --> 01:27:11,522
I'm a dancer.

1774
01:27:11,632 --> 01:27:12,860
Ah.

1775
01:27:12,966 --> 01:27:14,399
Ballet?

1776
01:27:14,501 --> 01:27:15,900
No.

1777
01:27:16,003 --> 01:27:17,231
Exotic.

1778
01:27:18,472 --> 01:27:20,201
Oh.

1779
01:27:20,307 --> 01:27:21,740
Sorry.

1780
01:27:21,842 --> 01:27:23,207
Don't be.

1781
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:24,334

our satellites against us,

Um...and, uh,

2275
01:51:54,513 --> 01:51:58,609
after 'Nam, I, uh,
got into crop-dusting.

2276
01:51:58,717 --> 01:52:01,982
And, uh, been doing
that ever since.

2277
01:52:02,087 --> 01:52:04,521
Oh, and on a, uh,
personal note, sir,

2278
01:52:04,623 --> 01:52:07,421
I'd just like to add
that, uh...

2279
01:52:07,526 --> 01:52:09,357
ever since I was
kidnapped by aliens

2280
01:52:09,461 --> 01:52:10,951
10 years ago,

2281
01:52:11,063 --> 01:52:13,122
I've been dying
for some payback,

2282
01:52:13,232 --> 01:52:15,860
and I just want you
to know that, uh,

2283
01:52:15,968 --> 01:52:18,300
I won't let you down.

2284
01:52:18,403 --> 01:52:20,894
You have one
tactical nuclear missile

2285
01:52:21,006 --> 01:52:22,906
we're loading
into this launcher

2286
01:52:23,008 --> 01:52:24,305
we're installing
under the right wing.

2287
01:52:24,409 --> 01:52:26,434
This is
the firing mechanism,

2288
01:52:26,545 --> 01:52:28,775
to be attached to
the ship's main console.

2289
01:52:28,881 --> 01:52:31,179
Just like the Amraam
launch pad on the Stealth.

2290
01:52:31,283 --> 01:52:34,377
Except the nuke will not
detonate at impact.

2291
01:52:34,486 --> 01:52:37,387
You'll have 30 seconds
to get your asses

2292
01:52:37,489 --> 01:52:39,013
out of there.

2293
01:52:39,124 --> 01:52:40,557
Good luck, gentlemen.

2294
01:52:41,727 --> 01:52:42,625
30 seconds.

2295
01:52:42,728 --> 01:52:43,695
Tell me. Tell me.

2296
01:52:43,796 --> 01:52:44,694
It was the strongest
radio transmitter

2297
01:52:44,797 --> 01:52:45,695
we could get.
It'll tell us

2298
01:52:45,798 --> 01:52:47,390
when you've uploaded
the virus.

2299
01:52:47,499 --> 01:52:49,399
30 seconds. Don't you
think that's cutting it

2300
01:52:49,501 --> 01:52:50,559
a little too close?

2301
01:52:50,669 --> 01:52:53,570
Oh, we're gonna be well
on our way back home

2302
01:52:53,672 --> 01:52:55,867
before we shoot
that thing off.

2303
01:52:55,974 --> 01:52:56,872
Why you?

2304
01:52:56,975 --> 01:52:58,602
David!

2305
01:52:58,710 --> 01:52:59,836
I don't--Excuse me.

2306
01:52:59,945 --> 01:53:01,344
I don't understand

2307
01:53:01,446 --> 01:53:02,606
why you can't
show someone else

2308
01:53:02,714 --> 01:53:05,080
how to plant the virus,
someone who is trained--

2309
01:53:05,184 --> 01:53:07,209
No, no.
Something may go wrong.

2310
01:53:07,319 --> 01:53:08,650
I may have
to think quickly,

2311
01:53:08,754 --> 01:53:09,880
adjust the signal.

2312
01:53:09,988 --> 01:53:11,319
Who knows?

2313
01:53:11,423 --> 01:53:13,823
Hey, you know how,
like, I'm always trying

2314
01:53:13,926 --> 01:53:15,894
to save the planet?

2315
01:53:18,564 --> 01:53:19,622
Here's my chance.

2316
01:53:22,901 --> 01:53:25,028
Now he gets ambitious.

2317
01:53:25,137 --> 01:53:25,237
It's too tight.

2318
01:53:25,237 --> 01:53:26,534
It's too tight.

2319
01:53:26,638 --> 01:53:28,697
Well,
I had to borrow it.

2320
01:53:28,807 --> 01:53:31,469
Let me see. OK. I guess
that's good enough.

2321
01:53:31,577 --> 01:53:34,444
So, how do I look?

2322
01:53:34,546 --> 01:53:36,741
Oh, thank you.
You're a lot of help.

2323
01:53:39,985 --> 01:53:41,145
You're late.

2324
01:53:41,253 --> 01:53:42,652
Well, you know me.

2325
01:53:42,754 --> 01:53:44,688
I know. You like
to make a big entrance.

2326
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:46,189
Let me help you.

2327
01:53:46,291 --> 01:53:47,349
Um, listen...

2328
01:53:47,459 --> 01:53:48,824
before we do this,

2329
01:53:48,927 --> 01:53:50,588
I just want to say
I'm sorry.

2330
01:53:50,696 --> 01:53:52,664
Sorry for what,
babe?

2331
01:53:52,764 --> 01:53:55,096
I should have done this
a long time ago.

2332
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,259
Do you have the ring?

2333
01:53:57,369 --> 01:53:58,597
Uh, yes, sir.

2334
01:53:58,704 --> 01:54:01,605
Here. Make yourself useful.
[Pat Pat]

2335
01:54:01,707 --> 01:54:02,605
Ow.

2336
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:06,108
Witnesses?

2337
01:54:06,211 --> 01:54:08,202
- Uh...
- Um...

2338

Sorry.
We got hung up.

2339
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:13,017
Well, let's get this show
on the road.

2340
01:54:13,118 --> 01:54:14,050
Dearly beloved,

2341
01:54:14,152 --> 01:54:16,643
we're gathered here
in the sight of God

2342
01:54:16,755 --> 01:54:19,383
and in the presence
of these witnesses

2343
01:54:19,491 --> 01:54:21,857
to join this man
and this woman

2344
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:23,154
in holy matrimony.

2345
01:54:23,262 --> 01:54:25,287
Any person who can show
good cause

2346
01:54:25,397 --> 01:54:27,388
why these two
should not wed,

2347
01:54:27,499 --> 01:54:31,162
please speak now, or forever
hold your peace.

2348
01:54:33,605 --> 01:54:37,564
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife,

2349
01:54:37,676 --> 01:54:39,075
to live together with her

2350
01:54:39,177 --> 01:54:40,337
in the holy state
of matrimony?

2351
01:54:40,445 --> 01:54:43,744
Will you love her,
comfort her,

2352
01:54:43,849 --> 01:54:46,010
honor and keep her
in sickness and in health?

2353
01:54:46,118 --> 01:54:49,485
And, forsaking all others,
keep yourself only for her

2354
01:54:49,588 --> 01:54:52,421
as long as you
both shall live?

2355
01:54:52,524 --> 01:54:53,752
I will.

2356
01:54:55,928 --> 01:54:57,225
Whew.

2357
01:55:06,638 --> 01:55:08,196
Good morning.

2358
01:55:11,977 --> 01:55:14,377
They're a little young.

2359
01:55:14,479 --> 01:55:15,912
That they are.

2360
01:55:17,916 --> 01:55:19,679
They look
a little nervous.

2361
01:55:19,785 --> 01:55:21,719
I'm gonna need
all flight crews

2362
01:55:21,820 --> 01:55:24,152
to report to their
designated areas immediately.

2363
01:55:25,257 --> 01:55:27,157
Major, can I borrow that?

2364
01:55:27,259 --> 01:55:28,157
Sir.

2365
01:55:29,661 --> 01:55:30,559
Good morning.

[Feedback]

2367
01:55:33,365 --> 01:55:34,457
Good morning.

2368
01:55:36,568 --> 01:55:39,036
In less than an hour,
aircraft from here

2369
01:55:39,137 --> 01:55:44,097
will join others
from around the world,

2370
01:55:44,209 --> 01:55:47,610
and you will be launching
the largest aerial battle

2371
01:55:47,713 --> 01:55:49,908
in the history of mankind.

2372
01:55:51,717 --> 01:55:54,618
Mankind. That word
should have new meaning

2373
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:58,087
for all of us today.

2374
01:55:58,190 --> 01:55:59,589
We can't be consumed

2375
01:55:59,691 --> 01:56:03,218
by our petty differences
anymore.

2376
01:56:03,328 --> 01:56:06,229
We will be united
in our common interests.

2377
01:56:06,331 --> 01:56:12,201
Perhaps it's fate that today
is the 4th ofJuly,

2378
01:56:12,304 --> 01:56:16,764
and you will once again be
fighting for our freedom...

2379
01:56:16,875 --> 01:56:20,003
not from tyranny, oppression,
or persecution...

2380
01:56:22,547 --> 01:56:24,174
but from annihilation.

2381
01:56:25,684 --> 01:56:28,175
We are fighting
for our right to live.

2382
01:56:29,888 --> 01:56:31,287
To exist.

2383
01:56:31,390 --> 01:56:35,292
And should we win the day...

2384
01:56:35,394 --> 01:56:38,795
the Fourth ofJuly
will no longer be known

2385
01:56:38,897 --> 01:56:40,956
as an American holiday...

2386
01:56:41,066 --> 01:56:44,092
but as the day when the world
declared in one voice,

2387
01:56:44,202 --> 01:56:47,569
we will not go quietly
into the night!

2388
01:56:47,672 --> 01:56:51,267
We will not vanish
without a fight!

2389
01:56:51,376 --> 01:56:53,401
We're going to live on!

squared away in this duffel.

OK, sir.
