whether I think you're right.

That's why I'm here.
Bullshit!

of your team eight months ago,
and that's why you're here.

That's right.
You didn't do anything wrong.

371

But it was your decision that sent them
down the left hallway...

and not the right,
out the front door and not the back.

So now you're hiding
behind that desk.

How's he doin', Iris?

482
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,608
I'm sorry about your partner.
We just moved him to an office.

Oh, shit.
He needs a doctor fast.

484
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,812
Why wasn't there an alarm
on your back door?

485
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:24,191
That alarm hasn't worked in months.
They're still out there.

486
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:27,561
Some kind of a truck out there
in the forest. It's not moving.

Are you kidding me?
They must have assumed
we'd call for backup.

I'm having a little problem here.
The phones aren't working.

489
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,167
Sure, they cut the wires.
The storm could've
taken the phones out.

490
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,576
Bullshit! Those are Bishop's guys
out there. They cut the wires.

491
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:46,481
Just try the radios!
Forget it.
Frequencies are blocked.

492
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,213
The frequencies are blocked?
That's not easy to do.

493
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,654
Well, they must've got professional help,
because all the frequencies are blocked.

494
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,191
They probably screwed up
your cell phones too.

They're Bishop's guys out there!

They're gonna break him outta here
one way or another.

Maybe somebody heard the gunshots
and will come check it out.

500

There's nothing out there
but factories.
No, no. I don't buy any of that.

Maybe they're trying
to give us a way out of this.

What in God's name
are we supposed to do then, Sergeant?

These are just scare tactics, all right?

They don't know how much firepower
we have or don't have.

They're not gonna come in here again.

Let's barricade up
these doors and windows,

and I'll figure out
how to get some help in here.

What are you doing this for, Jake?
Nobody gives a shit anymore
about anything.

We can end this right now.
I can't let a murderer
walk out of here.

I can't do that.

I'll get us out of this, Jasper.
I will. I promise.

You got almost no chance
out there, buddy.

That cop in there dies if I don't try.

You keep the place locked down
until I get some help.

All right.

557
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:20,814
I'd better cover from the front windows.
I can see the truck better from there.

You pulled a guy's spine out
once, didn't you?

Are you a surgeon?

572
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,756
I heard that bullet
you took in your belly is still
lodged in there, rattling around.

573
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:11,124
I bet you it's causing you
a lot of intestinal issues.
Right? Right, man?

574
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,762
Bishop, I need to talk to you.

575
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,139
So I just killed a man.

576
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:28,567
His name was Danny Barbero.
A cop.

577
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:32,742
A cop who works for Ray Portnow.

578
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,750
The man you killed.

579
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:39,517
So tell me why cops are risking
their lives to get to you, Bishop.

580
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,287
Why should I answer that question?

581
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,660
Because I'm thinking
about sending you out to the wolves
and saving my own ass if you don't.

582
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:59,141
I assume you know
who I am, Sergeant.

583
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,972
You're a scumbag gangster.

584
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:05,880
And one of my scumbag partners in crime
is your fellow officer, Marcus Duvall.

585
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,714
Marcus Duvall and his entire team.

586
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:12,882
We used to split things 50-50.
Marcus got greedy. He wanted more.

587
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:16,222
- So you killed Ray Portnow.
- After he tried to kill me.

588
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,523
Mm. Right.

589
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,588
They're here to execute me,
because if I make it to court,

590
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:25,863
every single one of them goes to jail
for the rest of their days.

591
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,370
How many cops
are involved in this?

592
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,239
I can't say exactly, but the blood money
runs through your entire department.

593
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:36,803
I bet they're all here now,
and they can't allow me
to leave this precinct alive.

594
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,077
They can't allow any of us
to leave here alive.

595
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,018
Now that we all know
it's them out there.

596
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,022
Sarge.

597
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:51,921
Poor guy, he never had a chance.
Anyone know ifhe had any family?

598
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,988
Someone's coming.!
Shit, someone's coming.!

599
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,863
- Someone's coming.
- Hit squad, Sergeant.

600
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,935
They're here for all of us.

601
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:11,846
Me?
All of us. You especially.

602
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,748
Fuck you, dealer.
This is all your fault.

603
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,548
Those are your brethren
out there, old man, not mine.

604
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:22,422
Don't compare me with your scumbag
friends out there. If it was up to me,
I'd kick your ass out the door.

605
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:26,793
- I'd like to see you come try.
- Yeah, sure. You'd love to kill
another cop today, wouldn't you?

606
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,957
Only you.

607
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:32,127
They'll be coming on strong now.

608
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:35,035
Why? Why are cops
coming to kill us?

609
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:39,132
They need to kill him
before he fingers them in court.

610
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:43,236
They need to kill us too,
now that we know it's them.

611
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:47,545
So... here's what we're gonna do.

612
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,314
We're gonna take positions
all around the precinct,

613
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,947
and we're gonna hold 'em off
until dawn.

614
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,958
Iris, Alex, you know
how to use a firearm?

615
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,960
No. No.

616
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,222
Why don't you give me
one of them guns, Sergeant.

617
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,563
I'll help you fend off the black hats.

618
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:26,484
Oh. Oh, shit. Men are here.
Good.

619
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,082
What a fuckin' mess this is.

620
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:31,753
I know.

621
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:36,266
I'm lookin' at this as a matter
of simple mathematics.

622
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,427
If we walk
and those eight people survive,

623
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:42,666
then 33 lives are destroyed.

624
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,942
The lives of my men
and their families.

625
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,775
People I'm responsible for.

626
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,711
People l...

627
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,687
People I love.

628
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,190
I don't see any other way, Marcus.

629
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,989
The blood trail leads right back to us.
We have no choice.

630
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,455
If we go through this,

631
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:12,992
we are gonna have to live with this
for the rest of our lives.

632
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,164
But you know something, Mike?

633
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,574
I could live with that
more than I could live with a cell mate.

634
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,240
Once we step outside,

635
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:29,046
those people are no longer
civilians or cops.

636
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,352
We gotta put 'em all down.

637
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:39,828
Without pause, without regard.

638
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:45,563
1,024. 2,048.

639
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,901

Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

642
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:01,874
The complex problems
force me to concentrate,

643
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:05,547
neutralizing any feelings of fear
I have at a given moment.

644
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:11,119
I hide behind its structure.
[Sighs]

645
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,959
You're gonna be all right, Doc.

646
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:19,901
[Laughs]
We don't know that.
Don't know that. You're so calm.

647
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,474
Thank you so much. Thanks.

648
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:34,409
You don't have to do this.

649
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,351
Yes, I do. I do.

650
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:41,323
If I'm gonna die,
at least I should die gracefully.

651
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,154
How are you keeping it together?

652
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:54,827
I just think about living.
I want to live,

653
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:58,432
as opposed to
I don't want to die.

654
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:05,706
That, and I keep telling myself
everybody's gonna make it this time.

655
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:10,352
We both know what
could happen here, Sergeant.

656
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,863
[Clicks]

657
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:28,462
Safety off.
Yeah. Right.

658
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:06,369
All right! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

659
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,673
- [Beck] All right, already.
- Come on. Get up.

[Groans]
Oh, come on.

661

Look, uh, here's the deal.

662
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:19,851
Those men that came in here...
they're still outside.

663
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:24,860
And... I have no idea
how many there are...

664
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,556
or what they're prepared to do.

665
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:31,192
Don't sweat it.
There's nothin' you can do.
You can't stop Bishop's people.

666
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:35,068
Go ahead, Sergeant. Tell them.

667
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:41,672
They're not Bishop's people.
They are police officers.

668
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:47,081
What! "Po-po" popping each other?
This is the fuckingest shit I ever seen.

669
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:52,019
This ain't Smiley's fight, man.
Let Smiley go. Let me go.

670
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:55,252
I totally figured it out.

671
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,317
Assassination politics, right?

672
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:01,694
By the government-sanctioned thugs
abusing their authority again, man.

673
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:05,394
Who's gonna save us from your
corrupt brethren, Sarge? You?

674
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,460
You?

675
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:14,769
I'm gonna do my best to protect you.
All right? All of you.

676
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,245
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I feel real safe, man.

745
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:31,528
Yeah, well, thank you
for that, sweet cheeks.
Now, put your weapon down.

746
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:35,230
The problem is outside, not inside.
Put the gun down, Jasper.

747
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,865
No, no.
You know what the problem is?
That we criminals got rights, baby.

748
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:43,277
That's right. We got rights
to be protected against assault
under any circumstances.

749
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,907
- If you can't provide that,
well, fuck you... we will.
- You're a fuckin' psycho.

750
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:50,578
Jesus Christ, Jake!
What? Are you gonna
trust these freaks?

751
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:54,350
Huh? The first chance they get
to blow our brains out, they'll try
to make a break for it.

752
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,154
They need us as much
as we need them.

753
00:59:57,226 --> 01:00:01,754
We all gotta start trusting each other
right now if we're gonna
make it through this night.

754
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,026
Put the gun down,
Jasper.

755
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:11,105
Put the goddamn gun down!

756
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:28,120
What?

757
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:42,128
- Shit.
- All right. All right.

758
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:47,142
Now, let's all introduce ourselves
to each other. It's New Year's Eve.
Let's turn over a new leaf.

759
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:52,848
All right. Let's not
all fuckin' speak at once.

760
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:57,477
The name's Smiley.
I'm a Libra, and...

761
01:00:57,553 --> 01:01:01,182
[Pats]
I'll handle these jokers.

762
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:05,193
You handle your people,
maybe we get out of here tonight.

763
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:14,028
He armed his prisoners.

764
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:16,936
It's a smart play.

765
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:20,100
Must be at least eight guns
in there now.

766
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:25,011
Just a couple hours till the sun's up.
If we can't breach, what do we do?

767
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,116
Get the A.V. -5 here.
Are you sure about that?

768
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,984
Yep. I'm not takin'
any more chances.

769
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:36,150
[Sighs]
It's gonna take a while
in this weather.

770
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:40,559
Marcus? What the fuck do we do
if it doesn't arrive in time?

771
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,827
We'll have to think of some
other way of ending this.

772
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,796
You either flirting with me
or clocking my game
'cause you don't trust me.

773
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:53,501
I don't like your beady little eyes
all over my goodies,
so turn the fuck away.

774
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:59,714
You're manipulative,
weak knees and that sexy
copper complexion.

775
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:02,979
You're definitely
an Aries, baby.
You're pretty good.

776
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,577
Smiley thanks you.

777
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:08,852
We got something in common,
you know that?

778
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:12,326
You comin' down
off some shit, ain't ya?

779
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:15,091
Don't be ashamed, man.
Don't be ashamed.

780
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,325
What's your poison?

781
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,359
Seconal to bring me down.
Adderall to bring me back up.

782
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:24,838
You gotta get up
to get down.
Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah.

783
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,899
All right.
That's enough. Come on.
Let's pay attention.

784
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:31,174
I want a cigarette so bad.

785
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,944
Stupid New Year's resolutions.

786
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:41,049
Hey, gangster,
you make any resolutions? Hmm?

787
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:43,285
What do you think,
secretary?

788
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:49,229
Oh, my God. I can't stop
thinking about sex.

789
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,460
I mean, I usually think
about sex a lot, but this is crazy.

790
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,632
Sex and death
are very closely related.

791
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:03,611
The Greeks called it Eros
and Thanatos... love and death.

792
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:08,241
Or sex as a way
of nullifying thoughts of dying.

793
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:12,720
What's your deal, gangster?
You actually been shot five times?

794
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:22,053
Six.

795
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,634
You really
pull a man's spine out?

796
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:29,796
It was an Adam's apple.

797
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:37,270
If you ever get
into tussles, secretary,

798
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:41,009
you grab a man
by his throat, hmm?

799
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:45,144
Dig it?
And then you squeeze.

800
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:51,683
I guarantee you he will drop.
He will not get up
for quite some time.

801
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,261
Oh, God. It's really quiet
out there now.

802
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,299
Yeah.

803
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,903
That's what worries me.

804
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:16,246
[Wind Whistling]
[Bishop] We're not gonna make it till
morning. Marcus Duvall will not allow it.

805
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:20,688
We've got eight people
covering six entry points.
If we work together, we will make it.

806
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:25,318
Look at it this way. That's me out there.
You think I'd let you survive
until the morning?

807
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:29,455
- We don't have a lot of options here.
- Well, we got to figure something,

808
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:34,469
'cause I'm not gonna stay here all night
waitin' to get killed.

809
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:38,303
If you use the situation
to try and escape,
it's about me and you,

810
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,899
'cause when this is over,
you're goin' back to jail.

811
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:43,741
- Relax, Sergeant.
- "Relax."

812
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:46,680
This ain't about me and you.
Not yet.

813
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:50,185
- Our shit's on pause, huh?
- Yeah. Our shit's on pause.

814
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:56,558
You saved my ass back there.
Why?

815
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:59,424
Everyone in here
is my responsibility.

816
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:02,157
It's my job.
That's noble.

817
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:05,860
Unfortunately,
I don't share the sentiment.

818
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:09,598
I see a cop in jeopardy,
he's on his own,

819
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:12,732
unless it benefits me
to jump in for the save.

820
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:16,107
Listen. I don't try
to be anything I'm not.

821
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,373
That ain't gonna change;
I don't care what day it is.

822
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:21,575
You remember that,
Sergeant.

823
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:24,415
Hey.! Someone's comin'.

824
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,790
Oh, God.
It's Capra, Sarge!

825
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:39,699
[Bishop]
You know this guy?
[Roenick] He's a cop. He works here.

826
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,237
They'll execute him.

827
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,932
- Capra!
- Shh!

828
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:56,040
Yeah. Drive. Drive!

829
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:59,417
[Iris]
Oh, my God. He's gonna make it.
[Bishop] He still has to get by the sniper.

830
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:01,888
[Roenick]
Come on, Capra.!

831
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:06,720
[Gunfire]

832
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:15,601
He's still moving.
They didn't get him yet.

833
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:17,662
Where are you going?

834
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,240
[Panting]
Come on. Come on.

835
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,813
Come on, Capra.! Come on.!

836
01:06:31,887 --> 01:06:34,515
- [Gun Cocks]
- [Gunfire]

837
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:38,250
Come on!

838
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:46,060
What the fuck is goin' on?

839
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,831
Who's fuckin'
shootin' at us, Sarge?
[Roenick Panting]

840
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,671
Who the fuck
are all these people?

841
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:58,237
What are you doin'here, Capra?
What are you doin'here?

842
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:00,612
It's New Year's Eve.
I knew you'd be here alone.

843
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:06,053
- I came to have a drink with Iris.
- You picked the wrong night
to make your move, baby, believe me.

844
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,386
You know, that's really sweet.
[Gun Cocks]

845
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:12,188
That's really sweet, but, unfortunately,
I don't believe a fuckin' word of it.

846
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:17,127
Put that goddamn weapon down,
you psycho! He works here!

847
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,724
I don't care
that he fuckin' works here, man.
He could be a plant.

848
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:23,397
No, Jasper. Put the gun down, all right?
Let's not start that again, all right?

849
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:28,000
He comes here in the guise
of courting that lady.
It's a fuckin'ingenious plan.

850
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:31,513
They get one of their boys in here
and then take us out one by one by one.
Come on. Tell 'em.

851
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,014
They shot at him.
All right? They shot at him.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

852
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:38,247
Oh, but they conveniently
fuckin' missed, didn't they?
The act is a fuckin' charade!

853
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,685
Come on. Tell 'em.
He's fuckin' right, Anna.

854
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:41,916
[Beck]
Isn't it a fucking charade?
Do I have a gun?

855
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,824
Do I have a fucking gun?
I can't hurt you.

856
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:48,660
It's not fuckin' good enough,
rat-bitch. Come on. Just lock him up,
man, so he doesn't do any damage.

857
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:52,360
Come on. Come on, Roenick.
Listen to me, man.
We're not lockin'this man up.

858
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:55,199
Not in my precinct, all right?
I vouch for him.

859
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,339
Okay. Okay, I'm fuckin' sorry,
but your authority has been
super-fuckin'-seded.

860
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:05,574
You understand?
You're not in charge anymore.

861
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:08,742
Right, Bish? Bish, tell 'em.

862
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:11,912
He could be one of them, man,
so fuckin'easily.

863
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:14,478
You don't think
we see right through you?
Fuckin'believe that shit?

864
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:18,926
Comes in here playing that game,
playing stupid. You don't think we know?

865
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:21,861
Right, man?
Let's do the math.

866
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,191
Let's put him away, man,
just play it safe, you know?

867
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:30,705
Put it down.
No, no, no. Come on.
Come on, man. Come on.

868
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,537
Just do the math. Come on.
Motherfucker comes in like that,
playing...

869
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:37,036
[Beck Gasping]

870
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:41,641
[Gasping Continues]

871
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:50,591
Come here. Sergeant Roenick
is in charge. Understand?

872
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:57,627
"Yes."

873
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,135
Let's go.

874
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:11,370
Only because I respect you.
But I still say this shit
is fuckin' illogical bullshit, all right?

875
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:15,611
He may not be who he says he is.
Just mull that shit over.
Think it over. Think it over, man.

876
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:24,351
Iris, look after Capra,
fill him in on what's goin' on.

877
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:27,657
All right, Capra?
Just be cool so no one else here
gets spooked.

878
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:31,689
Everybody else,
back to your positions.

879
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,477
Thank you.
Don't.
That was self-preservation.

880
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:46,641
The more men we have,
the better chance we stand.

881
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:51,015
Are you sure
you vouch for this man?
I do.

882
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:54,547
Come with me.

883
01:09:56,725 --> 01:10:01,128
You know, I hate to admit it,
but Smiley agrees with what
you said back there.

884
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,325
Smiley want a fuckin' medal?
Hear me out, man.

885
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,563
Look, we're out of our shackles
for what? The last time
in the next 15, 20 years?

886
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:10,434
All right, man. Get to the point.
What do you want?

887
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:13,737
Listen to me, man.
Look out that window.
That's freedom, baby.

888
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:16,869
Get what I'm sayin'?

889
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:19,972
Look, maybe this New Year's
can bring something different
for us after all.

890
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,075
Beck like Smiley now.

891
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:26,212
[Man]
Eight months ago he loses his team
when a deal goes sour.

892
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:28,222
Problem with drugs and alcohol
since the incident.

893
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:34,058
Burned-out cop.
Only a matter of time
before he drops his guard.

894
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:38,498
Watch the truck.
They'll eye it as a way out.

895
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:43,436
- What's the word on the A.V.?
- Storm's starting to let up,
so it shouldn't be long now.

896
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,401
Good.

897
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,713
Someone gets inside,
takes off, goes for help.

898
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:59,515
It's too obvious.
We'd need a distraction.

899
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:02,318
We also need the keys.
Your cop said he dropped 'em
in the snow.

900
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:06,760
- [Anna] I could hot-wire a car.
- I thought you never committed a crime
in your life?

901
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:09,627
- I haven't.
- Yeah.

902
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:13,259
Just picked up some shit
along the way.
Whoa. Hold on.

903
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:19,069
How do we know she's not just gonna drive
out of here and leave us all here to die?
Who the fuck are you, Miss Fuckin' Little Skirt?

904
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:22,542
Shake that skinny ass
in somebody else's face.

905
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:26,138
Okay, Anna. No offense,
but I'll feel better if somebody
goes with you.

906
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:31,482
Maybe I should go.
I promise I'll make her get help.
Scout's Honor.

907
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:38,757
It's either me orJasper.
[Bishop]
Can't be.

908
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:41,762
We need your guns.
It's gotta be...

909
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:44,060
[Alex]
Me.

910
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:49,738
- Me.
- [Bishop] You?

[Throaty Laugh]

912
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:57,442
- Shoot.
- Hey, I'll go. I'll do it.

913
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:01,972
- What? It's the only thing
that makes sense, right?
- [Anna] Whatever.

914
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,485
Whatever the fuck ever.
Let's just do this. Come on.

915
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:06,919
Me and... me and the doc.

916
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,583
Fine. Okay.

917
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:13,924
What? It's the right move,
Sergeant. I know that.

918
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:16,260
All right. All right.
I'm the doctor, right?

919
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,266
Right.
You can handle that?
Yes.

920
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,529
You can?
I don't know. I don't know.

921
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:24,971
But I have to try, okay?
No. No.

922
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,373
Please. I have to go.

923
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,208
I have to do it.

924
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,810
[Screams]
Shit!

925
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:47,788
Hey! Those two skels are buggin' out,
just like I told you they would.

926
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:51,731
They torched the bus
for a diversion, I guess.

927
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,159
Come on!

928
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:02,968
- [Roenick] Aw, Jesus.
They're gonna get themselves killed.
- They're dead already.

929
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,542
We can use this.

930
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,817
[Duvall]
Very smart.

931
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:20,919
They knew we'd expect them
to make for the car.

932
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,759
Free life, baby!
We did it.
Yeah. I told ya.

933
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:26,733
Happy New Year. Now, how are we
gonna get the fuck out of here?

934
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:30,363
Visual on two men. No shot.

935
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:34,701
Moving to a better vantage.

936
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:46,045
Hey. You sure
you wanna do this?

937
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:50,016
Yeah.
All right.

[Gunshot]
[Screams] Aw, shit!

939
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,568
- They're fucking shooting!
- Where'd they hit you, man?

940
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,571
My shoulder.

941
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:06,733
Let's go! Come on!
Let's haul ass now!
Okay, okay.

942
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:09,300
Go. Go.
You go.

[Yelping]

All right. Come on.
Come on, baby. Come on.

945
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:31,158
This was not the plan, man!
This was your idea.

946
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:34,225
Come on.
We're so fucking close. Come on.
I think I can still make it.

947
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,328
Come on, man. You can do it.

948
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:41,069
- I'm on target.
- [Gunshot]

Come on, man.
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do, man?

951
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:57,958
- Don't make me go at this alone!
- [Sniper] Target two blocked.

952
01:14:58,026 --> 01:15:03,464
- No shot.
- Have position but no shot.

What the fuck's up with
that multiplication table shit?

Fuck you!
It's freakin' me out.

955
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:11,338
You couldn't hot-wire my ass!
You're a liar!
Liar?

What did I tell y'all?

963
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:06,394
What'd I tell you?
You and your sergeant boyfriend
didn't believe me.

964
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:10,522
- What?
- Sergeant boy.
That's your boyfriend, right?

965
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:13,568
- No.
- Yeah.

966
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:18,902
They made it.
They're clear!

God-fucking-damn it, the five
of us can't hold them back.

They're gonna take out each
and every one of us. What are we
supposed to do, Sarge?

What do you want to do
with the body, Marcus?

987
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:08,606
Bishop's men were responsible
for all this, remember?

988

Let's get this thing done.

Last stand.
Your gun would be appreciated.

Why did I let her go?

I know a lot about dying,

There are two ways
you can handle it:

with the self-pity or without it.

What did you tell 'em?
Why didn't you let 'em inside?

Aah!

It wasn't me, Jake.
