Well, uh, see you
on the river, I guess.

Get off my damn foot!

141
00:10:41,122 --> 00:10:43,682
[Gail] lt'll be a long haul
with him at the oars.

142
00:10:43,758 --> 00:10:46,124
Guy in back
knows what he's doing.

143
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:48,754
Frank used to be
a guide on the Colorado.

Daddy!

Is this where you sign up
for river rafting lessons?

147
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:04,108
I got a dry jacket
and a pair of reef walkers.

148
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:07,705
The guy at the camping store
said that's all I'll need.

00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,728
Roarke.

158
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:58,094
Roarke.

159
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,792
Roarke!

160
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:12,678
It's beautiful.

161
00:12:12,747 --> 00:12:15,079
- Yeah.
- Really.

162
00:12:16,884 --> 00:12:18,818
[Sighs]

163
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:35,401
Okay, sweetie,
put your helmet on, please.

164
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:37,300
Mom.

165
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:41,102
You don't have to wear it all the time,
but we got some rapids comin' up here.

166
00:12:43,077 --> 00:12:46,706
- Just give me a hand, damn it!
- It's coming up!

167
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,850
You all right?

168
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:53,944
[Gail]
If you're gonna sit there in the back...

169
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:56,956
you should sit on
the floor in the center.

170
00:12:57,024 --> 00:13:00,187
- I can't see from there.
- Well, then, sit in front.

171
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:02,229
I like it here.

172
00:13:02,296 --> 00:13:04,696
Okay.

173
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,701
[Roarke]
Here we go!

174
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:10,896
Woo-hoo! Heh!
[Laughing]

175
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:13,998
Wow, this is great!
[Shouting]

176
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:20,414
[Roarke]
Yes! Hold on, Maggie!

177
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:27,711
[Roarke Whooping]
Look out for that rock!

178
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:36,696
Ohh!

179
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:39,392
- [Laughing]
- Whoa!

180
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:44,434
That was great!
But where's Dad?

181
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:46,939
[Laughing]
He's swimming.

182
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:52,541
- [Gail] Point your feet down!
- Point your toes, Dad!

183
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:56,674
Could you just stop laughing
for a second and help me into the boat?

184
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:58,981
- [Laughing Stops]
- [Moaning]

185
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:00,953
- Ohh!
- Oh!

186
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:03,217
[Moaning]

187
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,282
Is this the biggest one, Mom?

188
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,294
The biggest one's
the Gauntlet.

189
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:10,296
That's a five-plus.

190
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:12,798
That's off the scale.

191
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:16,598
- When do we do that one?
- Well, we don't do that one.

192
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,639
That's after the take-out
at Bridal Creek.

193
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:22,904
- You can't go down there.
- Have you ever done it?

194
00:14:22,977 --> 00:14:26,435
- Mom is saying it's too dangerous.
- For you, maybe.

195
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:29,449
Roarke. Honey,
I went down the Gauntlet...

196
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:33,283
when I was 18 years old
with two other guides...

197
00:14:33,354 --> 00:14:35,288
experienced guides.

198
00:14:35,356 --> 00:14:37,950
And we were just lucky.

199
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:41,961
But there were two other people
that summer who did not get so lucky.

200
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:46,523
One guy got killed,
and the other one is paralyzed for life.

201
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,196
Don't worry. We're gonna hit
some threes and some four-pluses...

202
00:14:51,272 --> 00:14:55,174
and we will risk death
a number of times on this trip.

203
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:58,575
So you're gonna scream,
you're gonna be so happy.

204
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:03,977
- Hey, look, Mom, there's Wade!
- [Gail] Hello, the shore!

205
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:07,214
- [Wade] Hello, the boat!
- Is everybody okay?

206
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:10,451
- Yeah, I just got a cramp!
- We're trying to work it out.

207
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:13,152
Hey, who's your friend, Gail?

208
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:17,186
Oh, this is Tom,
uh, Roarke's father.

209
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:21,132
Oh, no. You didn't tell him
about us, did you?

210
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:23,227
[Laughing] No.

211
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:27,741
Hey, Roarke!
Don't tell those fish we're comin'!

212
00:15:29,977 --> 00:15:33,913
[Gail] All right,
let's bring a little line in, okay?

213
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:37,075
We're gonna aim for that ripple
right over there. See?

214
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:39,210
Ten, two, ten, two...

215
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,220
ten, release!

216
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:42,915
Then let go of your line.

217
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,926
Why don't you ask your dad
if he wants to come over?

218
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:50,327
Hey, Dad, you wanna try this?

219
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:52,524
Not now!
Thanks, buddy!

220
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,263
[Roarke] Do you think
he even knows he left Boston?

221
00:15:56,337 --> 00:15:58,771
Yeah, he knows.

222
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:03,674
But he took two planes
and a charter just to get here, so...

223
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:05,678
let's give him a break.

224
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:09,842
- Try it again.
- Why are you suddenly on his side?

225
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:12,852
I'm on everybody's side.
I'm the mother.

226
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,388
- [Gasps] You got it! That's it!
- Look, Mom!

227
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:18,914
You got a nice one, buddy.
He's a beauty.

228
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:20,927
Let's get him.
There he is.

229
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:22,929
Come here.
Come here, sweetheart.

230
00:16:22,997 --> 00:16:26,899
Look, Daddy.
Oh, it's a monster.

231
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:29,435
You know,
this is the first time...

232
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:33,098
we've all had dinner together
since Mom's birthday.

233
00:16:36,777 --> 00:16:40,543
Hello, the Gail, Roarke
and Tom family!

234
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:43,139
This is the Wade raft
passing you by!

235
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:46,414
Hey, Wade!
I caught two fish today!

236
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:48,682
First time I ever fished!

237
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:50,781
Must be that lucky hat!

238
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:56,694
Hey, Roarke, if that hat's so lucky,
I want it back!

239
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:15,177
Hi.

240
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:18,343
- He's down.
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,445
- [Sighs]
- Well, had a big day.

242
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:28,290
It's kind of warm.

243
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:32,356
That's the way I like it.

244
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:43,073
Did you finish
your sketches yet?

245
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,275
No. No, I didn't.

246
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:50,647
And it's not a sketch, Gail.

247
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:54,176
- You know, it's very important.
- Very important, I know.

248
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:56,189
- So, tomorrow...
- What?

249
00:17:56,257 --> 00:18:00,057
Could you just pretend
to like it here a little bit?

250
00:18:00,127 --> 00:18:02,561
For Roarke's sake,
if not for mine.

251
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,567
I don't do too bad at pretending
to like your stuff, so...

252
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:14,233
Is that what you do?
Pretend to like my stuff?

253
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:18,244
- No. You know, that's not what I mean.
- You don't have to.

254
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:22,510
And just don't.
And don't do me any favors, either.

255
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,381
I don't.

256
00:18:27,354 --> 00:18:29,288
I won't.

257
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:35,962
Gail.

258
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:40,057
- Listen, don't you ever realize...
- Let's just stop, okay?

259
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:42,364
You never...
Oh, please!

260
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:47,098
[Gail Laughing]

261
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:49,734
[Screaming]

262
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:53,473
- [Laughing]
- [Roarke] Whoa, it's cold!

263
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:55,447
Whoo!

264
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:57,541
[Maggie Barking]

265
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:05,083
[Roarke Whooping]

266
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,650
Wow!

267
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:12,495
Hey, look, Mom!
Graffiti!

268
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:14,796
Oh, wow!

269
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:18,269
Those are pictographs.
They were made by people...

270
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:21,467
who lived here thousands of years
before white men came.

271
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,567
So those are their hands?

272
00:19:23,644 --> 00:19:26,374
Those markings might've been
made by a boy your age...

273
00:19:26,447 --> 00:19:28,938
while he was
on his vision quest.

274
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:31,746
See?

275
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,356
Are you sure there's
fish around here, Mom?

276
00:19:37,624 --> 00:19:40,286
Over there, honey.

277
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:44,363
Right in the current.

278
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:46,922
- [Maggie Whimpers]
- Hey there!

279
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:51,570
We've been waitin' for you.

280
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:55,597
I should've suspected something
when he had us camp at the walk-out.

281
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:58,611
Frank and Terry'd been
arguing most of the day.

282
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,614
Frank used to be married
to my sister...

283
00:20:01,682 --> 00:20:03,616
until she realized
what a butthole he was.

284
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:06,619
Anyway, Frank said things
he shouldn't have said.

285
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:09,622
And this morning,
we woke up and he was gone.

286
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,716
Why didn't you guys just follow him out,
walk out with him?

287
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:15,694
That would have been
the smart thing to do...

288
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:18,163
but I didn't want
to give him the satisfaction.

289
00:20:18,232 --> 00:20:21,201
And what he was doin' with the oars
didn't look that hard...

290
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:25,534
so we just headed downriver...
and we saw this.

291
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:28,541
That's when we decided
to wait for you guys.

292
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:32,204
- Wade said you used to be a guide here.
- Yeah. Roarke, come over here.

293
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:35,737
Is there any way
we could walk out of here...

294
00:20:35,816 --> 00:20:39,217
- like go up the canyon and...
- Uh, well, you might...

295
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:42,744
but once you got up
to that canyon rim...

296
00:20:42,823 --> 00:20:46,452
and headed back to the ranger station,
there's a huge gorge.

297
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:49,155
You'd have to walk around it.

298
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:52,960
Even if you had the equipment
and knew what you were doing...

299
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:56,730
and where you were going,
it'd take you five or six days.

300
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,673
Looks like we're stuck.

301
00:21:02,743 --> 00:21:04,677
Well, we...

302
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:09,011
- I could get you as far as Bridal Creek.
- Yeah.

303
00:21:10,184 --> 00:21:13,881
We... wouldn't want
to be a burden.

304
00:21:14,988 --> 00:21:17,218
Well...

305
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:20,920
it doesn't look
like you have much choice.

306
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:23,622
All right.

307
00:21:23,697 --> 00:21:26,689
[Gail]
Anyway, it's not as bad as it looks.

308
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,895
- You just got to stay to the right.
- Maggie!

309
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,803
There's a bad hole on the left.
Don't hit that.

310
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:33,897

- And a husband.

Go get it, Maggie.

Hey, Ro! I got another one
for your collection.

473

- Hi, Wade!
- Hey, buddy.

474
00:32:06,328 --> 00:32:10,992
But I got the cigarettes too, so we had
ten cartons of cigarettes and no beer.

479
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:31,182
So, Mom, what's this vision quest
thing you told me about?

480
00:32:32,387 --> 00:32:35,288
Vision quest is, um...

481
00:32:35,357 --> 00:32:38,190
is when a boy or a girl
your age...

482
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,285
from one of the tribes
that used to live around here...

483
00:32:40,362 --> 00:32:43,820
would go off for about
four or five days...

484
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:47,494
all alone without
food or anything...

485
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:52,529
and they'd go to one of their
sacred places, like where we were.

486
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:55,975
They'd wait there for a vision
of their guardian spirit...

487
00:32:56,044 --> 00:32:58,808
to appear to them.

488
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:01,145
They believed that
that guardian spirt would then...

489
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:05,175
watch over them and
protect them all their lives.

490
00:33:08,757 --> 00:33:13,524
If you'd had a successful vision quest,
you'd do two things.

491
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:16,155
First, you'd send up
a smoke signal.

492
00:33:16,231 --> 00:33:18,995
Smoke signal.

493
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:23,003
Yeah. That's so your folks
would know you're okay.

494
00:33:23,071 --> 00:33:27,337
And then draw an image on the rocks
just like the ones we saw today.

[Chuckling]
It's from your dad and me.

- Mom! Hey, look, guys, rollerblades!
- Are those the right ones?

- Nope.

I don't know. Is that what it's called
this far outside of Boston?

This far inside

618
00:43:27,462 --> 00:43:30,192
Really.

619
00:43:32,267 --> 00:43:35,293
- All right.
- They're right there.

620
00:43:36,571 --> 00:43:38,664
Be careful.
It's loaded.

621
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,113
- Bang. Bang.
- Hey!

622
00:43:54,189 --> 00:43:57,090
- Hey.
- Come on, man.

623
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:00,287
All right, all right.
Better give it back now. Come on.

624
00:44:00,362 --> 00:44:04,662
- Thanks, Wade.
- Hey, what are friends for?

625
00:44:09,171 --> 00:44:11,867
[Wade]
Don't forget. It's our secret.

626
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:22,873
Hey, what were you
and the guys talkin' about?

627
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,852
- Hmm?
- Things. I'm goin' fishing.

628
00:44:25,921 --> 00:44:29,288
Listen, if you want to catch
anything this time of day...

629
00:44:29,357 --> 00:44:31,552
you're gonna have to go
around that big rock.

630
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:36,359
There's a little eddy there. There's
some big fish waitin' for ya, honey.

631
00:44:37,832 --> 00:44:40,801
I'll call ya
when lunch is ready.

632
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:46,307
Take it up to that flat area there.
There's a spring if you want to wash up.

633
00:44:46,374 --> 00:44:48,934
[Roarke]
Come on, Maggie.

634
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:52,343
Be careful on the rocks.
Just stay close to the shore downstream.

635
00:44:52,414 --> 00:44:55,850
- Okay!
- Don't go where I can't see you.

636
00:44:55,917 --> 00:44:58,545
[Water Splashing]

637
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,952
I'll be right back.

638
00:45:10,465 --> 00:45:15,562
Terry?
Help me with this, Terry.

639
00:45:15,637 --> 00:45:18,470
Did you get the drinks, Tom?

640
00:45:19,975 --> 00:45:21,966
No, I didn't.

641
00:45:22,043 --> 00:45:25,240
I'll go get them.

642
00:45:25,313 --> 00:45:28,214
Oh, this looks pretty great.

643
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,888
Oh, boy.

644
00:45:38,393 --> 00:45:42,489
Ah, that's great.
You ought to try it.

645
00:45:59,314 --> 00:46:02,112
I'll get a towel.

646
00:46:02,183 --> 00:46:03,616
Oh!

647
00:46:23,305 --> 00:46:25,535
Wade!

648
00:46:28,143 --> 00:46:30,373
Oh, man!

649
00:46:30,445 --> 00:46:33,141
Wade!

650
00:46:41,523 --> 00:46:44,117
Come on!

651
00:46:46,328 --> 00:46:48,262
Wade!

652
00:46:50,332 --> 00:46:52,994
We're gonna make it.

653
00:46:53,068 --> 00:46:56,560
We're gonna make it.

654
00:46:56,638 --> 00:46:59,937
Roarke. Roarke. Reel it in, honey.
We're gonna find another place.

655
00:47:00,008 --> 00:47:01,942
You said this was
a good place.

656
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,309
- Just reel it in.
- It's stuck.

657
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,178
- Break it, damn it.
- What are you doing?

658
00:47:08,249 --> 00:47:10,183
- I'll explain later. Get in the boat.
- No!

659
00:47:10,251 --> 00:47:13,015
I don't want to ride with you!
I hate you!

660
00:47:13,088 --> 00:47:16,148
- Roarke! Get in the boat!
- What about Maggie?

661
00:47:16,224 --> 00:47:20,049
- Maggie! Maggie!
- Roarke!

662
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:21,947
[Wings Fluttering]

663
00:47:22,017 --> 00:47:25,953
- Come on, Maggie. Come on, girl.
- [Wade] Hey.

664
00:47:26,021 --> 00:47:29,923
What are you guys doin'?

665
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,961
We were just gonna go on ahead
and be by ourselves for a little bit.

666
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,089
Oh.

667
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:42,194
Yeah. It is our vacation and we haven't
been alone together all that much.

668
00:47:42,271 --> 00:47:44,637
I thought you guys
were runnin' out on us.

669
00:47:44,707 --> 00:47:47,403
[Gail]
No. Uh-uh.

670
00:47:50,212 --> 00:47:53,340
I think that's exactly
what they were doin', Terry.

671
00:47:56,752 --> 00:48:02,156
You're right. We were.
L-lt's just not working out between us.

672
00:48:02,224 --> 00:48:07,355
Why's that? Because your son
wants to be with me instead of you?

673
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:10,125
Roarke. Come here.

674
00:48:11,734 --> 00:48:15,465
Look, I'm taking my family
and we're gonna go down the river alone.

675
00:48:15,537 --> 00:48:17,471
That's what we're gonna do.

676
00:48:17,539 --> 00:48:21,202
I'm sorry.
We'll send somebody back to get you.

677
00:48:21,276 --> 00:48:24,677
Who died and made you stud dick
all of a sudden, Tom?

678
00:48:24,747 --> 00:48:27,215
[Gail] You go get in
the boat right now.

679
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:30,877
Wade, rangers come down here
all the time.

680
00:48:30,953 --> 00:48:35,219
You could hook up with one of them
and get to Bridle Creek ahead of us.

681
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,851
And what if I said
I'm not gonna let you go?

682
00:48:38,927 --> 00:48:43,057
What would you do?

683
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,374
- What would you do, stud?
- [Maggie Barking]

684
00:48:53,442 --> 00:48:55,876
- Hey! What is he...
- Just let him talk to him for a second.

685
00:48:57,412 --> 00:48:59,471
- I don't want to fight with you.
- Oh.

686
00:48:59,548 --> 00:49:02,142
- Wade!
- [Maggie Barking]

687
00:49:02,217 --> 00:49:05,812
I tried to be nice to you.

688
00:49:05,888 --> 00:49:08,516
I tried to be nice
to your family.

689
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:12,526
And what do you do?
You try and run out on me.

690
00:49:12,594 --> 00:49:15,256
I'm drownin', Tom.

691
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,298
- You wanna hit me?
- [Gasping]

692
00:49:17,366 --> 00:49:20,164
[Maggie Barking]

693
00:49:20,235 --> 00:49:22,203
I'm pullin' you down, Tom.

694
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:24,364
Whoa!
[Grunting]

695
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:27,203
- Hit 'im, Dad! Hit 'im.
- [Maggie Barking]

696
00:49:27,276 --> 00:49:30,336
Okay, we're even.
You hit me, I hit you. It's over.

697
00:49:30,412 --> 00:49:33,870
Now, I'm takin' my family
and I'm leavin'.

698
00:49:33,949 --> 00:49:36,713
- No, you're not.
- Look out, Dad! He's got a gun!

699
00:49:39,955 --> 00:49:42,048
Roarke.

700
00:49:46,662 --> 00:49:49,358
- Don't! Damn it! [Grunting]
- [Maggie Barking]

701
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:53,800
It's not gonna be that easy.

702
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:56,133
Get off of her!

703
00:50:00,175 --> 00:50:02,370
- Get off me!
- [Grunting]

704
00:50:02,444 --> 00:50:04,571
- [Growling]
- Get! Get!

705
00:50:04,646 --> 00:50:06,944
- [Maggie Whimpering]
- [Groaning]

706
00:50:08,817 --> 00:50:11,945
Don't, Wade! Stop!
He's my dad! Stop hitting him!

707
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,921
- [Maggie Barking]
- This is not fun anymore.

708
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:17,584
- [Gail] Oh, God, no!
- Wade!

709
00:50:17,659 --> 00:50:21,425
Wade, please!
God, please, don't...

710
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:28,935
I need your wife
to get me down the river.

711
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:33,441
- I need your son to control her.
- [Maggie Barking]

712
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:36,272
- You and the dog are expendable.
- [Maggie Barking]

713
00:50:36,345 --> 00:50:40,839
- [Barking Continues]
- Right now, I think I'll get rid of...

714
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:43,282
- [Barking]
- The dog.

715
00:50:43,352 --> 00:50:46,014
No! Run, Mags, run!

716
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:49,854
Run, Maggie, run!
Run! Run!

717
00:51:09,378 --> 00:51:11,778
You got guts, Roarke.

718
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:17,613
But you shouldn't have
broken your promise about the gun.

719
00:51:19,888 --> 00:51:22,686
Friends don't do that.

720
00:51:26,495 --> 00:51:28,793
I thought you were a nice guy.

721
00:51:28,864 --> 00:51:32,163
I am a nice guy.

722
00:51:33,235 --> 00:51:35,897
Just a different kind
of nice guy.

723
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:49,410
Damn, Terry.
Looks like we lose our deposit.

724
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:52,544
[Wade Laughing]
All right!

725
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:55,351
Now that I'm head of the family,
here's what we're gonna do!

726
00:51:55,424 --> 00:52:00,225
We're gonna haul ass down this river.
No more fishing. No more sightseeing.

727
00:52:00,295 --> 00:52:04,095
And unfortunately,
no more skinny dipping.

728
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,599
- By the way, Gail...
- [Clicking]

729
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:08,227
You're gonna get another chance
to run the Gauntlet.

730
00:52:08,303 --> 00:52:11,670
- We're not stopping at Bridle Creek.
- What?

731
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:16,268
That's right. Come on, let's get
this shit up the hill and outta sight!

732
00:52:20,215 --> 00:52:22,740
Roarke.

733
00:52:22,818 --> 00:52:25,412
Were you takin'
pictures of me?

734
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:28,550
Give me that camera.

735
00:52:30,425 --> 00:52:32,757
[Sighing]
