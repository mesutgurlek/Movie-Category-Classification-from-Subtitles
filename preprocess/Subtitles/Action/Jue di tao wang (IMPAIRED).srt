1
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,279
That's a negative
on Victor wong,

2
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:41,947
but we got
handsome Willie.

3
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,722
Woman:
Esmond, do you have
eyes on the house?

4
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,428
One lookout.
Down there on the deck.

5
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,530
<i> One more on the second floor</i>
<i> by the windows.</i>

6
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,435
<i> Handsome Willie and company</i>
<i> entering the house now.</i>

7
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,073
Leslie:
<i> We capture Victor wong's man</i>
<i> in that house</i>

8
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,775
<i> with the matador's</i>
<i> product,</i>

9
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:12,044
<i> we prove Victor wong</i>
<i> is the matador.</i>

10
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,482
<i> Bennie, we'll get him</i>
<i> this time.</i>

11
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,420
Bennie:
<i> We are not clear yet.</i>
<i> Stay back.</i>

12
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:24,756
<i> If this goes wrong,</i>
<i> I'm not dragging you</i>
<i> down with me.</i>

13
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:25,924
<i> Stay put and cover me.</i>

14
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,067
Okay, I'm going in.

15
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,467
How are we doing
on the orders?

16
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:09,935
Almost filled.

17
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,137
<i> Still some waiting</i>
<i> on the next shipment.</i>

18
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,673
- -<i> He's almost here.</i>
<i> Keep packing.</i>

19
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:15,707
<i> Be sure everything</i>
<i> goes to plan.</i>

20
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,449
- Hey.

21
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,126
Man:
Be gentle.

22
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,927
Mind the packing.

23
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,438
Go take a look.

24
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,806
<i> See what's going on.</i>

25
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,810
Who are you?

26
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,013
Take that!

27
00:06:58,484 --> 00:06:59,651
We gotta go.

28
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,199
Esmond, get Leslie!

29
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,567
I'm on it.

30
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,789
- Stop them!
- Go, go, go!

31
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,177
Female anchor:
<i> Hong Kong reporter</i>
<i> is live on the scene.</i>

32
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,946
Details are scarce
at the moment,

33
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:42,981
but it's believed a police
drug raid gone wrong

34
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:46,585
is responsible for the collapse
of nearly a dozen homes.

35
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,087
Captain tang,
i did it on my own.

36
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,023
Victor wong
is a respectable
businessman.

37
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,925
In nine years,
have you found

38
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,126
<i> a shred of hard evidence</i>

39
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,162
<i> that Victor wong</i>
<i> is the matador?</i>

40
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,030
There is no matador.

41
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,266
<i> One man does not run</i>
<i> the Hong Kong underworld,</i>

42
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,302
and even if he did,
that man is not Victor wong.

43
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,612
You want justice
for your partner.

44
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,947
<i> I understand that.</i>

45
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,882
But your obsession
with this case

46
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,918
has taken a toll
on you personally.

47
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,020
Take a month off.

48
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,923
You should start thinking
about retirement, bennie.

49
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,091
Sir.

50
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:08,133
The vory code
in Russia says,

51
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:11,269
"you mess with
someone's family,

52
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,905
there are grave
consequences."

53
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:17,842
Man:
<i> Jesus Christ, dima,</i>
<i> you got the wrong guy.</i>

54
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,177
No!

55
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:28,453
<i> Well, I guess you're wondering</i>
<i> how I got here, right?</i>

56
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:29,921
<i> Allow me to explain.</i>

57
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,091
Whoa!

58
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,330
He was just
a local boy

59
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,799
from the wrong side
of the tracks,

60
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,034
and she was engaged
to a war hero.

61
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,705
But love won out.

62
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,339
Even after
she got sick,

63
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,075
they never
regretted a thing.

64
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,084
Would you shut up
with that thing?

65
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,322
A boy shouldn't
be playing with dolls.

66
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,891
Yes, dad.

67
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:14,799
Anyway, my dad would go
to the hospital

68
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,068
and read to my mom

69
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,437
from her own journal

70
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:23,074
and she would remember
little moments

71
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,509
of their life.

72
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,950
They died in
each others arms.

73
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:35,820
<i> Are you serious?</i>

74
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,123
He's literally reciting
the plot to "the notebook."

75
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,758
- Shhh.
- All: Shut up.

76
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,762
I know it's corny.

77
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,297
I just always believed
in the power of love

78
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,099
a little more than
the regular guy.

79
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,168
Jeez.

80
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,804
Even now with the houses,
and the Porsche,

81
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,940
and the...
Other Porsche,

82
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,110
I was just always
holding out

83
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,379
for a true love
like that.

84
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,886
I'm sorry.

85
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,921
To answer your
first question

86
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,289
I'll have the chicken.

87
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,124
Thanks.

88
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,371
Oh. Sorry.

89
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,939
Watch where
you're going, asshole.

90
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,274
I'm sorry.

91
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,547
Purpose of your visit.

92
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:39,984
Here to see the sites,
but then again,

93
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,320
what's there to see
when the loveliest sight

94
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,455
is right here?

95
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,365
Welcome to Macau,
Mr. Cunningham.

96
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,937
Excuse me, I thought
you were supposed to have

97
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,271
a car here for me, right?

98
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,906
No, no, I'm standing
right here.

99
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,408
Right now I don't
see a car anywhere.

100
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,076
I'm in front
of the terminal.

101
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,515
Hey, kid, I think
this belongs to you.

102
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,920
That's my toy.
Thank you.

103
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,391
- All right.
- Take your bag, sir?

104
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:21,559
Thanks.

105
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,590
Connor:
Look what he got tonight!

106
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,668
Much obliged,
everybody.

107
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,205
Oh, man, ain't that
the breaks, I...

108
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,037
That was quite
a display.

109
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,672
It's not everyday
you meet an American

110
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,340
that plays baccarat.

111
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,609
It's not everyday
i meet someone

112
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,110
who leaves me speechless.

113
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,312
Samantha.

114
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,447
I run guest services
for the casino.

115
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,282
The hotel would
like to offer you

116
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,617
a suite
for the evening,

117
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,319
if you are interested.

118
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,388
A suite?
Well, that's
a little cozier

119
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,657
than what
I'm used to, but--

120
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:03,728
ah, you know, just let me
cash in my chips

121
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,265
and I'll be all yours.

122
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:10,568
- Sure.
- Okay.

123
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,324
Sweetheart,
didn't I tell you

124
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,226
backlight's the key
to these photos?

125
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:38,296
You gotta use a flash.

126
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:40,231
Oh, hey, will you
take a photo

127
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,500
of me and my gal?

128
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:45,036
Please?

129
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,405
- Samantha.
- Boss.

130
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,275
Enjoy.

131
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,649
If you're taking
a discreet photo,

132
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:02,286
it helps to
be discreet.

133
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:03,521
Thanks for that.

134
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,025
Why were you
so nervous?

135
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,693
Come on,
he's my boss.

136
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,061
I gotta be cool.

137
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,271
Dealing with obnoxious
gamblers like me

138
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,807
night and day must get
pretty exhausting.

139
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,709
Occupational hazards.

140
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,180
And you're not
that obnoxious.

141
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,648
Well, the night's
still young.

142
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,518
You eaten yet?

143
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,287
Wanna grab
some breakfast?

144
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:37,789
I'll think about it.

145
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,757
Okay, you think
about it.

146
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,370
Oh, back so soon.

147
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,809
Sergei, ha!
Man, you look different.

148
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,210
Did you shave your back?

149
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:00,278
Start walking upright?

150
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,612
Heh! Good times.

151
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,451
<i> You think you can</i>
<i> hide from us?</i>

152
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,523
Why did I have asparagus?

153
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:15,593
Wait, I have money.
I can pay now.

154
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,595
Dima wants
a word with you.

155
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,131
So we take you back
to Russia.

156
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,799
Can't we just talk
via Skype?

157
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,572
You ladies didn't forget
anything in the room,
did you?

158
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:28,739
Like say this.

159
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,216
Ah!

160
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,394
Hmm.

161
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,555
Help me!

162
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:18,723
- - Ah!

163
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:27,832
Whoa!

164
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,634
Hey, guys!
What did I say?

165
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:30,902
Let's go to Russia.

166
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:33,571
I love Russia.

167
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:36,307
Connor watts should
never have set foot

168
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:37,608
onto the vip floor

169
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,345
using your key card.

170
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,781
I just met the man
last night.

171
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,217
Whatever you think
of these video shows,

172
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:47,418
you're wrong.

173
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,520
You should have
recognized him.

174
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,823
<i> He cheated this casino</i>
<i> out of a million dollars.</i>

175
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,192
Samantha.

176
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,460
Find him and you
can fix it.

177
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,233
I'll be keeping
my eye on you, hmm?

178
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,537
Send out everyone.

179
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,472
I want him dead or alive.

180
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,289
Okay...

181
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,765
Hello?
This is Leslie.

182
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,700
Leslie, it's bennie.

183
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:10,968
I need to locate someone.

184
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,604
Can you run the apb for me?

185
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:17,441
- His name is Connor watts.
-<i> Okay, got it.</i>

186
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,409
Leslie:
<i> Bennie, I found him.</i>

187
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,311
<i> Sending you</i>
<i> his location now.</i>

188
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:04,021
Connor:
<i> Yep, looks like I screwed</i>
<i> the pooch this time.</i>

189
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:10,094
Hello, Connor.

190
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:11,762
Natalia!

191
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,769
I believe you know
my daughter, huh?

192
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,805
Natalia, you told me
your dad was a butcher.

193
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,707
He is.

194
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,909
Dima:
<i> Natalia said you were</i>
<i> nice American.</i>

195
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,077
<i> Very respectful.</i>

196
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:28,746
Otherwise
you would be dead.

197
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:30,448
I'm pregnant, Connor.

198
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,649
Who?

199
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:34,051
Connor, I'm pregnant.

200
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,053
I don't believe
you can get pregnant

201
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,089
the way we did it.
Not that we did it.

202
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:41,792
You marry my daughter,
i let you go.

203
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:43,027
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

204
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,596
We got a big
misunderstanding here.

205
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:47,798
<i> Trust me, you don't</i>
<i> want me to marry her.</i>

206
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,801
I mean, planning a wedding
on such short notice

207
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,403
is a logistical nightmare.

208
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,040
Dasha, again.

209
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,608
Oh! Oh, oh.
Oh, oh, no.

210
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,811
No hard feelings,
Connor.

211
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:01,979
Ah!

212
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:19,096
- Connor watts?
- Who's asking?

213
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,531
Bennie chan.

214
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,466
- Hong Kong police.
- Hong Kong?

215
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,439
Whoa! Hey. I can
only walk so fast.

216
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,476
Whoa!
Ah!

217
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:33,644
Excuse me.

218
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,183
I'm sorry.

219
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,499
Excuse me!

220
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,201
Look out!
Ah! Look out!

221
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:58,569
Look out!

222
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,070
Oh, god.
Ah!

223
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:23,093
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

224
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,138
Whoa! Ah!

225
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,587
Connor:
I don't mean
to tell you your job,

226
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,522
but I think taking a car
would be faster.

227
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,060
Connor watts,
you stole money
from casino.

228
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,828
I bring you back
to Macau.

229
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,996
Let's go.

230
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,102
Dasha:
Give us the American.
No one has to die.

231
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,073
Sorry.

232
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,055
Connor:
<i> Bennie! Hey, bennie!</i>

233
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,257
<i> A little help!</i>

234
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:29,193
<i> Bennie! Hey, bennie!</i>

235
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,998
Oh! Ooh!

236
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,882
Bennie, help, help!

237
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:26,617
Help, bennie!

238
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,232
Help! Help!

239
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,004
It's about time.

240
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,342
I'm telling dima.

241
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,070
So heavy.

242
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,644
Connor:
Not so rough.

243
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,983
Bennie:
Hey!

244
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,718
He's mine.

245
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,754
Who is this man?

246
00:27:36,756 --> 00:27:38,055
A Chinese cop.

247
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,390
Now get him!

248
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,732
Hey, it's not honorable
to fight girls.

249
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:53,303
Then stop acting like one.

250
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,112
Oh, ow!

251
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:15,426
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

252
00:28:15,428 --> 00:28:16,727
Ow.

253
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:17,895
You did not--

254
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,135
size d?

255
00:28:58,137 --> 00:28:59,770
Double d.

256
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,341
Connor!

257
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,353
What are you doing?

258
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:52,289
Bennie!
I was just trying
to give us a head start.

259
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,892
- Uh.
- Thanks for opening
the door.

260
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,059
Go!

261
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,430
So you're taking me
back to Macau.

262
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:01,965
That's my plan.

263
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,536
You seem like such
a great travel buddy.

264
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:08,071
It's a shame I can't
fly back with you.

265
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:09,473
What do you mean?

266
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,441
Don't you need
a passport to fly?

267
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,889
How did you get
my lighter?

268
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:28,058
Better question is
how did I get your passport?

269
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,593
We need to be there
in two days.

270
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,595
Hey, hey, hey,
calm down a little.

271
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:34,565
Don't you know
there's an ancient
Chinese proverb that says

272
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:37,301
"out of every crisis
comes opportunity"?

273
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:51,248
Announcer:
<i> The 745 will be arriving</i>
<i> on track eight.</i>

274
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,284
<i> Please show your ticket</i>
<i> before boarding.</i>
<i> Thank you.</i>

275
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,955
Hey! Do you want
some pizza?

276
00:30:57,957 --> 00:30:59,623
I'm ordering from
the U.S. embassy.

277
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,458
- Open up.
- I'm sorry,

278
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,293
I can't hear you
through this glass.

279
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,464
Can you hear me now?

280
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,466
Connor:
Dude, you are stressed.

281
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,902
Let's take a beat.
Get you a massage.

282
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,237
Maybe grab
a Margarita.

283
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:14,972
You're wound up
tighter than a--

284
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,006
ow!

285
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:17,207
What was that for?

286
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,243
Stress relief.

287
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:21,011
You know, I'm actually
feeling a little--

288
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,145
hey, hey!

289
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,380
Excuse me.

290
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,083
Please, my friend,
low blood sugar.

291
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,987
It looks like Connor watts
has left the country

292
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:33,190
and bennie chan
is on his trail.

293
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:35,659
Bennie chan?

294
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:38,528
Eliminate them before
they get back to Macau.

295
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,964
Do not rest
until that phone

296
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:43,233
- is safely
in your hands.
- Understood.

297
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:46,536
Our men are tracking
him down as we speak.

298
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,639
If you have to use
Samantha, do it.

299
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:56,213
You gotta teach me
that two finger trick.

300
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,148
Where did you learn that?
Pro-wrestling?

301
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,150
Only teach men
of honor.

302
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:02,019
Here. Eat.

303
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:06,323
I'm a grown man,
i don't need you
to feed me.

304
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:08,058
A grown man
pays his debts.

305
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,030
Keep your energy up.

306
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:15,265
You know, I'm on
kind of a cleanse.

307
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,234
Eat it.

308
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,402
Eat it.

309
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:26,276
Mmm. Nice and crunchy,

310
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,411
what is it?

311
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:29,313
Goat testicle.

312
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,521
It's delicious.

313
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,189
<i> Bennie, you gotta</i>
<i> try these.</i>

314
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:40,424
Mm-mm.

315
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:43,160
I bet you can't eat
just two.

316
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:44,328
It's a righty.

317
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:53,570
How about those guys
who want to find me?

318
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:56,006
It's not something
i stole in Macau, bennie.

319
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:59,977
- It's something I saw.
- What did you see?

320
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,980
Attendant:
<i> Tickets and passports,</i>
<i> please.</i>

321
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,181
Let's go.

322
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,557
Jump!

323
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,158
No, you jump!

324
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,693
I'm not asking twice.
Jump!

325
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,428
I thought you weren't
asking twice.

326
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:21,264
Fine.
I jump, you fall!

327
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,137
Connor:
<i> Unbelievable.</i>
<i> My suit's filthy.</i>

328
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:30,440
- Bennie:<i> Uh, shut up. </i>
- Connor:<i> Whatever.</i>

329
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,476
Look, why don't we
do each other a favor,

330
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:35,545
cut our losses and
go our separate ways?

331
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,147
This means
nothing to you?

332
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:39,216
He's gonna kill
my goddaughter.

333
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:40,450
My family.

334
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,653
<i> I'll take you back</i>
<i> to casino.</i>

335
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,088
I'm sorry.

336
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,791
So you're working for them.

337
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:50,761
I'm police.

338
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:52,596
Honorable.

339
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:54,564
There's something else
you should know, your honor.

340
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,334
They don't want me because
i stole something from them.

341
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,503
They want me because
i saw them shoot somebody.

342
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:01,371
I woman died in my arms.

343
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,827
-<i> Ester yee! </i>
- Help me.

344
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:37,607
And you're telling me
that if I don't go back
with you then she dies.

345
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:40,677
And I'm telling you
if I go back with you,
I'm going to die.

346
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,312
<i> They're gonna kill me.</i>

347
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:48,752
I don't care.

348
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,754
I'm not loving
the attitude, bennie.

349
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:51,148
You're tough,
just like your father.

350
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,582
What do you know
about my father?

351
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,544
- Nothing?
- Leslie:<i> Nothing.</i>

352
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,379
<i> I know this may not</i>
<i> be what you want to hear,</i>

353
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,282
<i> but there's no evidence</i>
<i> of a murder at a Macau casino.</i>

354
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,585
<i> If there was</i>
<i> we'd know about it.</i>

355
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:03,620
<i> I think he's lying</i>
<i> to you, bennie.</i>

356
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,390
I know.

357
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,321
Connor:
<i> What the hell's</i>
<i> he saying?</i>

358
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:39,623
I don't know.

359
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,693
You must be kidding.

360
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,262
This the one?

361
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:03,413
2016.

362
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,688
2012.

363
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,690
Hmm?

364
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:14,891
Okay.

365
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:22,499
Visa or mastercard?

366
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,380
I don't know why
it's not working.

367
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,693
Money.

368
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:51,361
We use one of yours.

369
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:52,896
- Where's your wallet?
- I don't have it.

370
00:38:52,898 --> 00:38:53,930
Why not?

371
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,365
Forgive me
for not being able

372
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,600
to grab my wallet
before being kidnapped.

373
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:01,604
How about that nice
watch of yours?

374
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,542
Not my watch.
No.

375
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:08,678
Well, how bad
do you want to get me
in Macau, bennie?

376
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,450
Money, money, money, okay?

377
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:37,407
Connor:
<i> You know, I think</i>
<i> I got you figured out.</i>

378
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:40,543
Something tells me
you're either unhappily
married

379
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,145
or there's no one
waiting for you at home.

380
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:44,147
You don't have me
figured out.

381
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,553
No, I'm not married.

382
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,422
Shocking.

383
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:54,157
Women do not go
for that whole

384
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,992
constipated
Debbie downer look.

385
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,595
Lighten up.
Smile a little, huh?

386
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,633
Look, unzip
my left pocket.

387
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:06,136
There's something
important in there.

388
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:07,570
I promise.

389
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,043
What's that?

390
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:15,145
Right before
the woman died

391
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:16,946
she handed me
that phone.

392
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:20,049
It's okay, it's okay.
Oh, no. It's okay.

393
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:21,418
Shh, shh, shh.

394
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:27,657
Oh, I'm dying.
Here.

395
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,161
Take this.

396
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:32,896
Take this phone...

397
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:35,498
You big dumb
American stranger.

398
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,101
Here, take it. Uh.

399
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:41,671
Yeah, pretty much.

400
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:42,972
There's something
on there, bennie.

401
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,041
All you gotta do
is charge it.

402
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,943
Maybe you can trade it
for your goddaughter.

403
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,044
Enough.

404
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:49,779
You will say anything
to get away.

405
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,081
I could have escaped
already if I wanted.

406
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,027
Sayonara, bennie!

407
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,031
Remember to smile!

408
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:13,503
Stupid.
Ah!

409
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,482
That's more like it.

410
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:27,917
Whoo!

411
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:41,064
Come on, come on.

412
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:42,232
No!

413
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,242
Come on, man.

414
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:53,209
Come on!

415
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,248
No, no, no, no!

416
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,159
How about this?

417
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,801
Bennie:
<i> Keep pushing!</i>

418
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:21,771
Connor:
2012, my foot!

419
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:23,072
Bennie:
<i> Harder!</i>

420
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:24,874
Connor:
Come on, ah!

421
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:35,752
Bennie:
<i> It says still</i>
<i> have a half tank.</i>

422
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:37,086
Connor:
<i> No big deal.</i>

423
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:39,055
<i> I saw a gas station</i>
<i> 200 miles back.</i>

424
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,057
Get out of the car.

425
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,592
Come on!

426
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:43,927
We walk.

427
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,864
Ugh.

428
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:49,165
Here, come.

429
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,134
What does that mean?

430
00:42:51,136 --> 00:42:52,335
What?

431
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:53,903
Which foot?

432
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,740
Jesus.

433
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,679
Short cut.

434
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:05,748
- Can't a girl
catch her breath?
- Whatever.

435
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,151
Connor:
<i> What's the chance</i>
<i> they'd settle</i>

436
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:10,820
<i> for you bringing back</i>
<i> some other white guy?</i>

437
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,755
I mean, we all look alike.

438
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,058
Bennie:
Shut up.

439
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,827
Connor:
Where's this
the shortcut to exactly?

440
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,762
Shut up, Connor.

441
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,867
Connor:
<i> I think the kid's hurt.</i>

442
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:28,371
- Bennie: Let's check on him.
- Connor: Yeah.

443
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:30,139
Are you--
are you okay?

444
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:31,841
Do you need help?

445
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:34,177
- Water.
- Bye-bye, bennie!

446
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:36,379
- Hey!
-

447
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:39,616
get off!

448
00:43:39,618 --> 00:43:41,651
Come on!
Bennie!

449
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,054
Go, go, go, go!

450
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:46,689
Oh! Shoot!

451
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:55,898
Oh, ho-ho.
Ow, my balls,
my balls! Ow...

452
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,107
Bennie:
Hey, hey, hey!

453
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:08,678
Ooh, wow.

454
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,346
You guys strong.

455
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,863
Connor:
You tell him, bennie.

456
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:26,956
No retreat!
No surrender!

457
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,062
Hit him in the ding ding.

458
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,191
What's that?

459
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,340
I don't get it.

460
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:18,941
You just got
your ass kicked
and they're cheering.

461
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,843
I fought with honor.

462
00:46:20,845 --> 00:46:22,345
You head-butted
his balls.

463
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,484
Oh, thank you.

464
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,221
I think he wants us
to have a drink with him.

465
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:34,991
No, we got to go.

466
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:37,794
Bennie, we can't be rude.
One drink.

467
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:38,928
- One?
- One.

468
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:46,035
All right, guys,
who knows some good
Mongolian drinking games?

469
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:53,976
Connor:
<i> Drink up, drink up!</i>

470
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,994
How do you do that?

471
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:17,567
- To the air!
- All: To the air!

472
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:19,902
- To the ground!
- All: To the ground!

473
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:22,371
- To the homies!
- All: To the homies!

474
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:24,874
Hooray!

475
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:26,108
All:<i> Hooray!</i>

476
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,013
I never would have
figured you

477
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:12,515
for an Adele fan.

478
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:18,087
"Rolling in the deep"
is a classic.

479
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:22,191
Thanks for stepping in

480
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:25,328
to fight the Mongolian
stomper today.

481
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,730
I know you weren't
fighting for me, per se,

482
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:31,067
but, still,
you're a man
with a code

483
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:34,103
and I respect that.

484
00:49:34,105 --> 00:49:37,673
I'm willing to die
for my loved ones.

485
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:41,110
Without people
to die for,

486
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:43,145
no reason to live.

487
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:47,683
Yeah, but there's
no reason for life

488
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:50,019
if you don't take time
to enjoy it.

489
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:52,722
You're too caught up
in your job.

490
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:55,091
You gotta get out there
and meet some friends,

491
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:59,362
take a pilates class,
have some fun.

492
00:49:59,364 --> 00:50:01,497
You like that girl tonight?

493
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,766
She liked you.
Why didn't you talk to her?

494
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,036
She didn't even notice me.

495
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:12,341
When was the last time
you connected with a lady?

496
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:17,013
My fiancée,
nine years ago.

497
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:20,583
You never told me
you were married.

498
00:50:20,585 --> 00:50:23,152
We not marry.

499
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:24,487
She left me.

500
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:26,522
Oh, I'm sorry.

501
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,290
What happened?

502
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:38,634
Victor wong have her.

503
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:40,436
The matador.

504
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,106
He killed my partner.

505
00:50:44,108 --> 00:50:46,575
I watch him die.

506
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:48,377
After that...

507
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:52,715
My life
became revenge.

508
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:59,288
I let everything
it slip away.

509
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,757
Connor's voice:
<i> "Bennie, sorry I had</i>
<i> to take off.</i>

510
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:11,227
<i> Don't take it</i>

511
00:52:11,229 --> 00:52:13,762

512
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:16,165
<i> All you have to do</i>

<i> to charge it.</i>

513
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:18,901
<i> Thanks for the honor lessons,</i>
<i> buddy. Connor."</i>

514
00:52:18,903 --> 00:52:21,704
Hey, young boy.

515
00:52:21,706 --> 00:52:23,806
Did you see
the American guy?

516
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:26,609
Just last night.
Buy my horse.

517
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:28,711
He bought your horse?

518
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:29,879
Cash?

519
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,250
Damn dumbest horse
in all of Mongolia.

520
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,451
Come on.

521
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:38,220
<i> Vámonos.</i>
<i> Vámonos.</i>

522
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:39,421
Come on!

523
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:42,291
- Hey, hey!
- Juh!

524
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:44,627
Hey, bennie, went to
make a coffee run.

525
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:46,762
I was gonna surprise you
with a mocha frappuccino.

526
00:52:46,764 --> 00:52:48,564
Bennie, bennie, no, no.
I bruise, I bruise, please.

527
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:50,499
I bruise, I bruise, please.

528
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,168
<i> Please.</i>

529
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:55,204
- You.

530
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:58,407
I want my refund.
You sold me a lemon,
you little shit.

531
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:02,745
You know,
this kind of big horse

532
00:53:02,747 --> 00:53:04,780
only runs
for a hundred miles.

533
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:07,750
Small horse,
run forever, stupid.

534
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:09,552
I'll remember that
the next time

535
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:11,187
I'm in Mongolia.

536
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:12,555
You had the money
all the time?

537
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:14,823
Just a little.
For emergencies.

538
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:19,595
You never stop lying.

539
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:21,630
How your parents
raise you?

540
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:23,832
You don't know a thing
about my parents.

541
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:25,401
Everything you say
is just horse apples.

542
00:53:25,403 --> 00:53:26,735
You see what I mean?

543
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:28,404
Connor:
Next time I talk
to my bookie,

544
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:30,472
"hey, sal,
sorry about that two grand,

545
00:53:30,474 --> 00:53:32,474
let me pay you
with a wallet full
of honor."

546
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:51,427
Don't say a word.

547
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,798
Bennie, bennie,
that's the guy!

548
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,666
No, hey, be quiet.

549
00:53:57,668 --> 00:53:59,635
That's the guy
who shot the girl
in the casino.

550
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,508
Victor wong?

551
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,810
Are you sure
that's who you saw?

552
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:09,378
He shot her
at point blank range.

553
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,347
That's not something
you forget.

554
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:13,849
I take you to Hong Kong.

555
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:15,584
I spend my career
trying to prove

556
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,986
Mr. wong is the matador.

557
00:54:16,988 --> 00:54:19,388
Now you can.

558
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:23,359
I'm taking you to testify
against wong.

559
00:54:23,361 --> 00:54:25,694
What?
Victor wong
will see to it

560
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:26,795
that I don't even
get to trial.

561
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,430
Your proof
is on the phone.

562
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:29,598
<i> I'm not going.</i>

563
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,700
Hell, no.

564
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:33,836
Okay.
Just be quiet.

565
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:36,572
All right.
I'll play it cool.

566
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,044
Help!

567
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:44,613
He kidnapped me
and he said he's going
to use my pretty face

568
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:45,781
to make a million dollars.

569
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,585
Sorry! He had brain damage.

570
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:51,754
I'm a loud, handsome,
arrogant American

571
00:54:51,756 --> 00:54:53,555
and you have
a lovely country

572
00:54:53,557 --> 00:54:55,057
<i> and I will</i>
<i> only ruin it,</i>
<i> I promise.</i>

573
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,059
<i> El diablo blanco.</i>

574
00:54:57,061 --> 00:54:58,661
He drink too much baijiu.

575
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:03,399
- Call Hong Kong police.
- Call the U.S. embassy.

576
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:05,467
Stop.
One at a time.

577
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,002
- He kidnapped me.
- I'm working a big case.

578
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:08,737
- Were you not listening?
- One at a time.

579
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:10,506
Shut up!
Both of you.

580
00:55:10,508 --> 00:55:11,907
- He started it.
- He started it.

581
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:15,544
Connor watts,
you're under arrest

582
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:17,613
for the murder
of ester yee.

583
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:20,616
Who's ester yee?

584
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:24,486
And officer chan,
you are being charged

585
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,388
with accessory to murder.

586
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,927
This is a setup.

587
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:35,064
Well, you two
are going back
to Hong Kong.

588
00:55:35,066 --> 00:55:36,532
Awesome.

589
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,545
Connor:
<i> May be for</i>
<i> the best, bennie.</i>

590
00:55:49,547 --> 00:55:50,913
Life in prison's better
than getting killed

591
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:52,548
by psychopaths.

592
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,383
<i> And jail might not</i>
<i> be so bad.</i>

593
00:55:54,385 --> 00:55:56,852
We can both get jacked,
get some tattoos,

594
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:58,387
maybe meet Morgan Freeman.

595
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:00,789
The phone.

596
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,424
We have to get it back.

597
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:05,527
Do you see the situation
we're in, bennie?

598
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:06,762
Impossible.

599
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:09,531
Do you know there's
a Chinese saying,

600
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:12,134
"in every crisis
there's opportunity."

601
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:16,739
I found that more convincing
when I was saying it.

602
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:19,942
Ow!

603
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:43,799
Who is she?

604
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:46,535
She's the
siberian Terminator.

605
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:56,178
Dasha, what a coincidence.
Of all the trucks to hijack.

606
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:58,781
Where is the other one?

607
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:01,717
I thought he's with you.

608
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:03,886
- Get out.
- My legs are asleep.

609
00:57:03,888 --> 00:57:06,622
You know it always
does this on long trips.

610
00:57:06,624 --> 00:57:07,923
Ow.

611
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,091
I said get out.

612
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:23,472
I'm sorry.

613
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:25,541
Bennie!

614
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:26,608
You missed.

615
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:31,079
Wow, you look great!
Those headbutts to the face

616
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,548
really treated you well.

617
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:42,858
No, no, no,
not the face.

618
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:45,761
Thanks.

619
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,964
I know this looks bad.

620
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,073
There.

621
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:17,693
Hey, hey, hey.
I told you I don't
fight women.

622
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:21,129
I know, that's why
i brought the gun.

623
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:23,765
Okay, okay.
Just one fight.

624
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:24,933
Come.

625
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:30,906
Good-bye,
Chinese man.

626
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,548
Now you are a killer.

627
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,517
I didn't mean to.
My leg hit the gear shift.

628
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:44,019
It was an accident.

629
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,821
You know, you are so
unappreciative.

630
00:58:45,823 --> 00:58:48,123
- She was about to kill you.
- That's no excuse.

631
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:49,758
This-- this
is the reason

632
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,760
I prefer public
transportation.

633
00:58:51,762 --> 00:58:54,029
We only have
one earth, bennie.
Holy shit.

634
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:57,666
Russians!

635
00:58:57,668 --> 00:58:59,167
Connor: Whoa!

636
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,879
How about a little
head's up next time?

637
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,080
Let's go!

638
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:23,659
Open it.

639
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:31,934
- Huh?
- Merry Christmas,
<i> compadre.</i>

640
00:59:31,936 --> 00:59:33,769
All you gotta do
is charge that thing

641
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:36,004
and you're in business.

642
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:37,873
You know, bennie,
i like you

643
00:59:37,875 --> 00:59:40,108
and I'm happy you're finally
getting what you want.

644
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,277
But sadly, I'm not
gonna be around

645
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:44,146
to see it happen.

646
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:45,614
Your turn.

647
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:54,056
You must be tired.

648
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:56,024
Always running away.

649
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:57,626
I mean it looks
pretty tiring

650
00:59:57,628 --> 00:59:58,794
fighting as hard
as you do.

651
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,834
Impressed?

652
01:00:05,836 --> 01:00:08,170
No. I'm actually
kinda pissed.

653
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,708
Don't point that thing
at me, man.

654
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:18,914
Hurry up, hurry up!

655
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:20,816
Which part of the pig
am I blowing on?

656
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:28,991
Is that what
we're trying to make?

657
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:39,267
The cops ask any questions,

658
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:41,903
you just look at them
like you don't understand
a word, okay?

659
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,409
Okay, that's good.

660
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:50,812
- Push harder! Harder!
- With this chopstick?

661
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:54,650
Connor:
<i> Can't believe these things</i>
<i> went out of style</i>

662
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:56,952
in the middle ages.

663
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:59,921
So, what's the plan?

664
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:02,824
We take the phone back
to Hong Kong police.

665
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,293
Captain tang have to
arrest Victor wong.

666
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,897
Well, great,
you don't need me.

667
01:01:08,899 --> 01:01:11,867
You're the only tying
Victor wong to the phone.

668
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:14,803
No you, no wong.

669
01:01:14,805 --> 01:01:17,806
<i> You have to testify.</i>

670
01:01:17,808 --> 01:01:20,208
You got Samantha into this.

671
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:24,079
Samantha's your goddaughter?

672
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:26,148
Well, I thought
there's supposed to be

673
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,116
like a billion people
in this country.

674
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,455
Rapids!
Paddle!

675
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:36,224
Connor:
<i> Whoa-ho!</i>

676
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:41,930
This ain't
so bad, bennie!

677
01:01:41,932 --> 01:01:44,232
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

678
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:47,402
- Whoa!
- Whoa-ho-ho!

679
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:00,749
- Promise you'll let me go.
- Promise you'll testify.

680
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:03,452
You're in no position
to negotiate.

681
01:02:03,454 --> 01:02:05,287
No.

682
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:11,793
I can't swim.

683
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,763
I can't swim!

684
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:17,966
What?

685
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:19,935
I can't swim.

686
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:21,470
Shit.

687
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:24,339
<i> Whoa!</i>

688
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:38,420
Oh, god.
I got you.

689
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,891
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

690
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:48,463
I can't believe
you can't swim.

691
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:50,799
Bennie:
No swimming pool
in my neighborhood.

692
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:55,771
Ah, ah, oh, god.

693
01:02:59,343 --> 01:03:04,112
For a second, I'm not sure
you're gonna save me.

694
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,381
I wasn't so sure either.

695
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:10,152
Is Hong Kong nice
this time of year?

696
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:15,123
Don't play with me,
Connor.

697
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:20,228
I'll testify.

698
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:22,230
For you.

699
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:23,865
And for Samantha.

700
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,940
Here.

701
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,413
I think we're
getting close.

702
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:14,182
- - Captain tang.
I'm Samantha.

703
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:17,419
I met you
at my father's funeral.

704
01:04:17,421 --> 01:04:21,156
Yes, of course.
I remember.

705
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:23,024
I'm in trouble.

706
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,360
I haven't been able
to reach my uncle bennie
in days.

707
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,996
I didn't know
where to go.

708
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:29,331
He said you
could help me.

709
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,234
Yes, of course.

710
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:46,381
Connor:
Wow, it's beautiful.

711
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,350
Kongming lanterns.

712
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:51,219
You make a wish
and let it float up
to the sky.

713
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:01,630
Boy:
<i> Hello?</i>

714
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,133
Hello.

715
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:07,302
Would you like one?

716
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,906
- For me?
- Yes.

717
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:11,907
Oh.

718
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,613
Well, let's make a wish.

719
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:21,082
To take down the matador.

720
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,184
To get Samantha
back safely.

721
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,407
Connor:
<i> Does that mean</i>
<i> wish granted?</i>

722
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:54,516
Connor, you're right.

723
01:05:54,518 --> 01:05:57,352
I work too hard.
Fight too hard.

724
01:05:57,354 --> 01:06:00,188
I have no life.

725
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,957
That's okay, bennie.

726
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:08,163
Why don't we go
find ourselves some power?

727
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,170
Hurry up.

728
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:17,005
- I'm hurrying.
- Almost.

729
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,507
Bennie:
<i> Almost.</i>

730
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,512
- Ready.
- Okay, let's do it.

731
01:06:28,452 --> 01:06:30,418
Thumbprint.
Damn it.

732
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:36,658
Good thing out
of every crisis

733
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,026
comes an opportunity.

734
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:39,494
What are you
talking about?

735
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,396
If that's
the matador's phone,

736
01:06:41,398 --> 01:06:43,498
then only has thumbprint
can activate it.

737
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,333
If Victor wong
opens it--

738
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:48,370
it shows that
Victor's wong
is the matador.

739
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:58,013
We've located chan
and the American.

740
01:06:58,015 --> 01:06:59,781
Do not let her
out of your sight

741
01:06:59,783 --> 01:07:01,483
until we return.

742
01:07:01,485 --> 01:07:02,717
Man on phone:
<i> I've got it under control.</i>

743
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:04,386
She's not going anywhere.

744
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,170
Spread out.

745
01:07:22,172 --> 01:07:23,805
Find them.

746
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:37,252
Ah-ah!

747
01:07:37,254 --> 01:07:39,454
I'll be damned.

748
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:46,061
Why, you little--

749
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:48,329
come on, let's go.

750
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:50,765
Mud festival.
Good for harvest.

751
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:55,570
Oh, this is bad.

752
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,205
I agree.
Someone should tell them

753
01:07:57,207 --> 01:07:58,506
this is gonna have
no effect on the harvest.

754
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:01,176
I mean that's
really bad.

755
01:08:01,178 --> 01:08:02,277
Oh.

756
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:04,712
There! Get them!
Now!

757
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:07,082
Is this the kind of time
we stay and fight, bennie?

758
01:08:07,084 --> 01:08:08,650
This time we run.

759
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:15,423
Bennie:
Oh, no, no.

760
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,691
Connor:
How do they keep
finding us?

761
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:17,859
Bennie:
No, no, no, no.

762
01:08:41,885 --> 01:08:43,651
Uh!
I'm shot!

763
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:46,321
Bennie:
No, no, you're not.
Just popcorn.

764
01:08:46,323 --> 01:08:48,356
It's just some popcorn.

765
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,709
Go, go!

766
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:26,661
Connor:
Hey! Hey!

767
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,296
Hey! Hey!

768
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:32,600
How do they keep
finding us?

769
01:09:32,602 --> 01:09:33,801
- The phone.
- What?

770
01:09:33,803 --> 01:09:34,903
They're tracking
the phone.

771
01:09:34,905 --> 01:09:36,437
Turn it off.

772
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,807
Hurry!

773
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:42,544
It's so difficult.

774
01:09:42,546 --> 01:09:45,613
On and off is
the simplest thing
a phone does.

775
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:01,462
Bennie:
Hurry!

776
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:14,442
Bennie:
<i> This is a hundred-family</i>
<i> feast.</i>

777
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:15,710
All the families gather--

778
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:18,947
are you a Wikipedia
all the time?

779
01:10:18,949 --> 01:10:21,316
Hey! Hey!
Don't eat the food.

780
01:10:21,318 --> 01:10:23,251
No, no, no!
Don't eat the food.

781
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,856
I'm sorry, sorry.
I'm sorry.

782
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:36,431
We must sing to pass.
It's a tradition.

783
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:38,433
Well, what's not
a tradition in
this country?

784
01:10:38,435 --> 01:10:40,902
Sing something.

785
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:50,945
Huh?

786
01:10:52,015 --> 01:10:53,414
Women:
Whoo!

787
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:56,517
Whoo!
All right! Chin chin.

788
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,729
Well, go on,
sing something.

789
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:09,998
Sing so we can go through.

790
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,924
Whoo!

791
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:24,706
- I can't swim.
- I'm scared of heights.

792
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:30,912
New plan.

793
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:34,582
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

794
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:50,965
There they are!

795
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:52,600
What's the weight limit
on this wire?

796
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:55,670
I better go first.
It might be safer.

797
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:56,904
And don't tell me
not to look down.

798
01:12:56,906 --> 01:12:58,473
Don't look down.

799
01:12:58,475 --> 01:12:59,640
Whoa!

800
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,479
Oh-ho-ho!
Whoa!

801
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:07,782
- Ah!
- Ah!

802
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:12,754
Bennie:
I'm slipping.

803
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:21,763
Easy on the ding-ding.

804
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:23,398
What?

805
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,867
It's the only thing
i can hold!

806
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:31,606
Bennie:
Too small.

807
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:34,675
This is a bad idea.

808
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:53,461
Don't hang there.
Use your feet!

809
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,066
I told you it was
a good plan.

810
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:04,806
Connor:
<i> How long are you going</i>
<i> to do this?</i>

811
01:14:04,808 --> 01:14:06,741
Until we get
to Hong Kong.

812
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:08,709
No, I mean this.
Chase guys like me

813
01:14:08,711 --> 01:14:10,178
halfway around
the world.

814
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,913
You know, you're no
spring chicken anymore.

815
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:13,681
I'm set in my own way.

816
01:14:13,683 --> 01:14:15,016
Not young enough
to change.

817
01:14:15,018 --> 01:14:16,584
Well, you could
still change

818
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:18,653
if you wanted to.
What would you do?

819
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:21,989
I like alpacas.

820
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:25,927
Okay. So we're talking
about alpacas now.

821
01:14:25,929 --> 01:14:29,564
To me, they symbolize peace.

822
01:14:29,566 --> 01:14:30,832
I've always wanted
to have one,

823
01:14:30,834 --> 01:14:33,801
but it's impossible
in Hong Kong.

824
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,237
Move out here
to the country

825
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:37,872
and have a whole
pack of them.

826
01:14:37,874 --> 01:14:39,974
Hell, start
an alpaca festival.

827
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,642
Or do they already have
one of those here?

828
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,180
Listen, I think you did
a really great job

829
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:48,483
<i> of looking after Samantha.</i>

830
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:49,650
Hey.

831
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,889
Settle down,
I'm being Sincere.

832
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:56,591
Look at me.

833
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:59,627
When you see her,
remember my face.

834
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:04,532
No, I just mean
even though you're
a hard ass

835
01:15:04,534 --> 01:15:08,102
and short tempered
and stubborn, mean...

836
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:11,072
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
get to the compliments.

837
01:15:11,074 --> 01:15:13,107
All right, even though
you're all those things,

838
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:14,976
she turned out great.

839
01:15:14,978 --> 01:15:16,844
Without you, hell.

840
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:23,184
Can I ask you
a serious question,
bennie?

841
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:25,520
How do you do
the two fingered thing?

842
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:30,791
Pressure.

843
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:33,027
Pressure here, okay?

844
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,062
You know, pressure.
Pressure.

845
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,535
Uh.

846
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:48,843
Connor:
What?

847
01:15:48,845 --> 01:15:50,678
Bennie:
You need to practice.

848
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,814
Just not like aim it!
Boom.

849
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:58,553
Hey!
You'll never learn.

850
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:26,747
Connor:
Uh! God! Shit!

851
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:30,017
Whoa-ho, whoa, whoa!

852
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:34,021
Bennie:
Need to keep body warm.
Keep heat in.

853
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:37,191
We don't have any
blankets or fire.

854
01:16:37,193 --> 01:16:39,026
We're fu--

855
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:41,829
we have each other.

856
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:43,764
Take the clothes off.

857
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:47,068
Oh, god.
Somehow I knew it was
going to come to this.

858
01:16:54,077 --> 01:16:56,844
How come you get
to be the big spoon?

859
01:16:56,846 --> 01:16:58,713
Shut up, Connor.

860
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:16,831
Connor:
Whoa! Just-- whoa!

861
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:18,299
- Bennie: Whoa!
- Connor: What are you doing?

862
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:19,900
What?

863
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:30,344
Woman: Eugene,
one of them's come alive!

864
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:32,013
Man:
Do you know where
the gift shop is?

865
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,351
It's not what
you think.

866
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:41,756
Bennie:
I need to call Sam.

867
01:17:41,758 --> 01:17:43,324
I really need
to wash my hands.

868
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:46,093
They were uncomfortably warm
when I woke up.

869
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,097
Hey.

870
01:17:57,773 --> 01:17:59,407
- Hello.
- Sammy...

871
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:07,348
Sammy!
Hello?

872
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,016
Samantha is just fine.

873
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:12,053
If you hurt her,
i promise--

874
01:18:12,055 --> 01:18:14,822
bring the phone
to the casino tonight

875
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:18,025
or I'll kill your Sammy.

876
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:20,127
No casino.

877
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:21,429
<i> We meet in public.</i>

878
01:18:21,431 --> 01:18:23,164
Kai tak terminal, 7:00 pm.

879
01:18:40,148 --> 01:18:41,849
Samantha okay?

880
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:45,419
Look, I can explain that.

881
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:46,854
I was gonna
give that back.

882
01:18:46,856 --> 01:18:50,057
You have excuse
for everything.

883
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,892
You're a liar.

884
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,828
Okay, fine.
Total honesty,

885
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:55,229
I wasn't gonna
give it back,

886
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,064
but that's when you
were being a dick.

887
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:58,999
Now that we're partners
i was gonna surprise you

888
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:00,101
and I was just
looking for--

889
01:19:00,103 --> 01:19:01,268
I don't partner
with cowards.

890
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,303
You're bad luck.

891
01:19:02,305 --> 01:19:03,804
You make things worse.

892
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:06,474
Oh, really?
If it wasn't for me,

893
01:19:06,476 --> 01:19:08,242
you'd be moping
around your apartment

894
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:10,144
eating ramen,
reading "alpaca daily."

895
01:19:10,146 --> 01:19:11,846
You say I'm lonely?

896
01:19:11,848 --> 01:19:13,380
If I'm lonely,
what are you?

897
01:19:13,382 --> 01:19:15,082
Where's the picture
of your family?

898
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:16,484
Back off, bennie.

899
01:19:16,486 --> 01:19:19,787
- You have no one.
- You're right.

900
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:22,757
I don't have anyone.

901
01:19:22,759 --> 01:19:24,925
All those stories
about my mom and dad

902
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,762
and how great they are,
i made them up.

903
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:30,197
I never knew them.
They dumped me at birth.

904
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,869
Does that make you happy?

905
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:41,008
Can I have my jacket?

906
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,152
You got the phone.

907
01:19:51,154 --> 01:19:52,453
So long, bennie.

908
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:27,321
Excuse me.

909
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:29,990
Would you mind
holding that for me?

910
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:31,992
- Yeah, okay.
- Thank you.

911
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:41,035
Aw, come on, dude.

912
01:20:41,037 --> 01:20:43,504
You hand me an urn
with somebody in it.

913
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:45,072
Why are you so nosy?

914
01:20:45,074 --> 01:20:47,241
Why you look inside?

915
01:20:47,243 --> 01:20:48,976
Do you just walk around
with that thing?

916
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:51,278
Inside is my friend.

917
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,281
Before he died,
i promise him,

918
01:20:54,283 --> 01:20:58,452
I scatter his ashes
in Victoria harbor.

919
01:20:58,454 --> 01:21:02,223
I make a promise,
now I'm doing it.

920
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:04,291
Do you have a problem
with that?

921
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:07,494
No, sir.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

922
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:09,096
I didn't realize.

923
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,042
You about a 40 jacket?

924
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,135
Bennie.

925
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:49,236
You look well.

926
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:51,372
Where's Samantha?

927
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:56,143
Give me the phone.

928
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:02,149
We can do this
the hard way,

929
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:03,617
if you'd prefer.

930
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:05,252
Sure.

931
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:06,620
Let's do this
the hard way.

932
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:17,364
Captain tang,
the phone has proof.

933
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:19,133
Victor wong
is the matador.

934
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:24,972
Bennie:
It can only be unlocked
by his thumbprint.

935
01:22:24,974 --> 01:22:27,274
Mr. wong,
would you mind
humoring us?

936
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:38,285
Not at all.

937
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,096
Bennie:
<i> How can this be?</i>

938
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:50,130
I'm not the matador.

939
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:51,332
Victor:
<i> I never was.</i>

940
01:22:51,334 --> 01:22:54,068
My Sincere apologies,
Mr. wong.

941
01:22:57,038 --> 01:22:59,573
Bennie chan,
you're under arrest

942
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:02,009
for accessory to murder.

943
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:03,477
<i> Take him away.</i>

944
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:15,489
Hey, Natalia,
it's Connor.

945
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:18,359
How's Russia?
How's your dad?

946
01:23:18,361 --> 01:23:19,727
Good.

947
01:23:19,729 --> 01:23:21,996
Listen, I want
to ask you a favor.

948
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:01,702
<i> It's ridiculous how long</i>
<i> you made me wait.</i>

949
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:04,104
How am I supposed to
cross-process my client

950
01:24:04,106 --> 01:24:05,606
in a timely and
litigious manner?

951
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:11,779
- Hey, bennie.
- Connor, what are you
doing here?

952
01:24:11,781 --> 01:24:14,715
Well, real men stay
and deal with their problems.

953
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:18,252
A wise man
once taught me that.

954
01:24:18,254 --> 01:24:20,621
You guys familiar
with the case Kramer
v Kramer,

955
01:24:20,623 --> 01:24:22,289
because you're
about to be?

956
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:25,225
A little space.

957
01:24:25,227 --> 01:24:26,326
They're gonna arrest you.

958
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:27,561
I'm your lawyer.

959
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:32,666
So, what's the plan?

960
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:34,635
I was hoping you
had some ideas.

961
01:24:34,637 --> 01:24:35,769
You come barging
in here

962
01:24:35,771 --> 01:24:37,838
with no plan
to get out?

963
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,740
Yeah, that's how
we do in America,

964
01:24:39,742 --> 01:24:41,241
fast and loose.

965

<i> Bennie chan's attorney's</i>

for saving us, Leslie.

969
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:26,220
Thanks for
letting me help.

970
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:37,231
Well, maybe when
this is over

971
01:25:37,233 --> 01:25:41,368
I could take you out
for a chicken and beer?

972
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:43,904
Yes, I'd love
chicken and beer.

973
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:49,710
Okay, we're ready.

974
01:25:49,712 --> 01:25:51,378
We've bypassed
the thumbprint.

975
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:54,915
Bennie, it just
looks like gibberish.

976
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:57,818
- It's nothing.
- Wait.

977
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,419
Stop right here.

978
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:05,559
I know where to go,

979
01:26:05,561 --> 01:26:07,761
<i> but we need a plan</i>
<i> to get out of here.</i>

980
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,874
Wait up, wait up.

981
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:25,212
This is the place.

982
01:26:36,658 --> 01:26:38,525
And Ben is the one
with the armed thugs.

983
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:49,803
- You and I split up.
- Okay.

984
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:51,838
Don't try to be
a hero by yourself.

985
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,943
Right, no need
to start now.

986
01:26:55,945 --> 01:26:58,312
Go! Go!

987
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:18,966
Man:
<i> I had no choice.</i>

988
01:27:18,968 --> 01:27:23,604
<i> I did what I had to do</i>
<i> to get the phone back--</i>

989
01:27:23,606 --> 01:27:27,007
<i> we never touched her,</i>
<i> just scared her a little.</i>

990
01:27:27,009 --> 01:27:28,942
<i> Tell him, Willie.</i>

991
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:31,545
I was only following
your orders.

992
01:27:31,547 --> 01:27:32,879
If I had known
who she was--

993
01:27:32,881 --> 01:27:34,815
you liar.

994
01:27:34,817 --> 01:27:38,352
<i> You couldn't have achieved</i>
<i> any of this without me.</i>

995
01:27:38,354 --> 01:27:41,288
I am the money man.
You need me.

996
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:43,423
Man:
<i> That's where</i>
<i> you're wrong, Victor.</i>

997
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:44,591
<i> I don't need anyone.</i>

998
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:51,932
Help.

999
01:28:11,919 --> 01:28:14,921
You really don't know
when to stop, do you?

1000
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:27,567
Connor?
What the hell
are you doing here?

1001
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:29,970
It's a long story.
I'll tell you over
breakfast.

1002
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:32,773
Forget breakfast.
Where is bennie?

1003
01:28:32,775 --> 01:28:34,941
I have to go find something
to open this with.

1004
01:28:34,943 --> 01:28:36,343
I'll be right back.

1005
01:28:36,345 --> 01:28:38,345
Don't you dare
leave me here.

1006
01:28:38,347 --> 01:28:40,947
I'm sorry I got you
into this.

1007
01:28:40,949 --> 01:28:42,416
Connor!
Connor!

1008
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:53,760
Bennie, I tried
to warn you.

1009
01:28:53,762 --> 01:28:55,796
Captain, the phone.

1010
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:32,099
You're the matador?

1011
01:29:32,101 --> 01:29:34,034
He looks like the kid
from Jerry Maguire.

1012
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:37,791
Thank you, Connor,
for sticking with me.

1013
01:31:37,793 --> 01:31:40,627
You're welcome, partner.

1014
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:09,122
Guns in the water.

1015
01:32:09,124 --> 01:32:11,124
Now.

1016
01:32:11,126 --> 01:32:13,960
Connor:<i> Dasha!</i>
<i> Oh, it's about time.</i>

1017
01:32:15,764 --> 01:32:17,163
Sorry we're late.

1018
01:32:17,165 --> 01:32:19,633
Well, just glad
you could make it.

1019
01:32:19,635 --> 01:32:21,868
Welcome to
the family, Connor.

1020
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,703
- Thanks.
- Bennie: Family?

1021
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:25,739
- Yeah, long story.
- Huh?

1022
01:32:25,741 --> 01:32:27,807
Hello, Chinese man.

1023
01:32:37,919 --> 01:32:39,085
Let's go.

1024
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:41,788
Hey, get 'em!

1025
01:32:51,832 --> 01:32:52,999
Look out.

1026
01:33:16,992 --> 01:33:19,893
Connor:
Go get Samantha!
Go! Go!

1027
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:32,038
<i> Go! Hurry!</i>

1028
01:36:20,007 --> 01:36:22,542
Hey, gentle.
Mind the packing.

1029
01:36:22,544 --> 01:36:25,145
Cocaine.

1030
01:37:18,133 --> 01:37:21,434
Yung.
This is the Hong Kong
police department.

1031
01:37:21,436 --> 01:37:23,236
<i> We have you surrounded.</i>

1032
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:30,043
Bennie!
The ship's sinking!

1033
01:37:30,045 --> 01:37:32,212
<i> Samantha!</i>

1034
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,887
Ah!

1035
01:37:43,023 --> 01:37:44,357
Esmond:
<i> We have you surrounded.</i>

1036
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:46,226
<i> Hands behind your head.</i>

1037
01:37:46,228 --> 01:37:47,861
Bennie:
<i> Connor, watch out!</i>

1038
01:37:50,164 --> 01:37:51,497
Freeze.

1039
01:37:51,499 --> 01:37:52,866
Boss.

1040
01:38:31,372 --> 01:38:33,172
Bennie!

1041
01:39:07,708 --> 01:39:10,543
Bennie!

1042
01:39:10,545 --> 01:39:12,278
Take care
of my daughter.

1043
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:31,364
No!

1044
01:39:31,366 --> 01:39:33,666
Bennie.

1045
01:39:33,668 --> 01:39:35,101
No!

1046
01:39:55,289 --> 01:39:58,624
I'm going to choose
to remember him

1047
01:39:58,626 --> 01:40:00,760
as he was before.

1048
01:40:00,762 --> 01:40:04,297
My father died
nine years ago.

1049
01:40:04,299 --> 01:40:07,166
He was a good man.
Best partner I ever had.

1050
01:40:07,168 --> 01:40:10,370
Ahem.

1051
01:40:10,372 --> 01:40:12,038
Best Chinese partner.

1052
01:40:17,144 --> 01:40:18,745
Taking off
for Russia tonight.

1053
01:40:18,747 --> 01:40:21,247
Really?
Why?

1054
01:40:21,249 --> 01:40:23,549
Wise man once told me
that honor

1055
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:26,219
is the most
important thing in life.

1056
01:40:26,221 --> 01:40:29,222
I made a promise
and I intend to keep it.

1057
01:41:11,266 --> 01:41:12,799
Sorry, Connor.

1058
01:41:12,801 --> 01:41:15,401
<i> Dos vedanya.</i>

1059
01:41:19,339 --> 01:41:20,640
Bennie:
<i> Where are you taking me?</i>

1060
01:41:20,642 --> 01:41:22,542
You'll never get away
with this.

1061
01:41:22,544 --> 01:41:26,079
Will you pipe down?
You're ruining the surprise.

1062
01:41:26,081 --> 01:41:29,115
Was he always this grumpy?

1063
01:41:29,117 --> 01:41:30,283
Hmm.

1064
01:41:38,659 --> 01:41:40,693
Keep the blindfold on.

1065
01:41:44,264 --> 01:41:45,598
All right.

1066
01:41:52,873 --> 01:41:54,674
Okay.

1067
01:41:54,676 --> 01:41:56,542
Surprise!

1068
01:41:59,146 --> 01:42:00,413
You took me
to my own farm?

1069
01:42:00,415 --> 01:42:01,581
No, this!

1070
01:42:06,753 --> 01:42:09,889
Bennie:
<i> Wow! Alpacas.</i>

1071
01:42:12,426 --> 01:42:13,826
Wow!

1072
01:42:16,296 --> 01:42:17,697
<i> Thought this might</i>
<i> keep you busy</i>

1073
01:42:17,699 --> 01:42:19,599
since you're no longer
chasing bad guys.

1074
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:24,337
Hey, guys!
Look at this.

1075
01:42:24,339 --> 01:42:25,538
Tada!

1076
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:28,808
Bennie, you're famous!

1077
01:42:28,810 --> 01:42:30,877
Ooh wee!
Hey!

1078
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:36,349
Speaking of...
Sam and I are
going to go

1079
01:42:36,351 --> 01:42:38,284
for a little walk.

1080
01:42:38,286 --> 01:42:42,221
No, I go, too.
Chaperone.

1081
01:42:42,223 --> 01:42:44,724
Don't worry, uncle bennie,
i still have the mace.

1082
01:42:44,726 --> 01:42:47,260
Good.
So all--

1083
01:42:47,262 --> 01:42:48,294
ow!

1084
01:42:48,296 --> 01:42:49,395
Damn.

1085
01:42:49,397 --> 01:42:50,530
What are you doing?

1086
01:42:50,532 --> 01:42:52,365
It didn't work,
did it?

1087
01:42:52,367 --> 01:42:54,367
I told you.
It takes practice.

1088
01:42:54,369 --> 01:42:56,202
I've been practicing.

1089
01:42:56,204 --> 01:42:57,370
So practice more.

1090
01:43:03,577 --> 01:43:04,944
Are they gone?

1091
01:43:04,946 --> 01:43:07,513
Yes.

1092
01:43:09,217 --> 01:43:11,417
Bennie, are you okay?

1093
01:43:11,419 --> 01:43:13,920
<i> Bennie?</i>

1094
01:43:13,922 --> 01:43:15,655
Bennie.

1095
01:43:15,657 --> 01:43:17,690
Are you okay?

1096
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:19,392
What have you done to him?

1097
01:43:21,528 --> 01:43:23,963
Bennie?
Bennie, wake up.

1098
01:43:25,465 --> 01:43:27,466
Come on, please.

1099
01:43:30,805 --> 01:43:32,838
Renny harlin:
<i> One, two, three, action.</i>

1100
01:43:55,463 --> 01:43:56,929
I really don't know
how to swim.

1101
01:43:56,931 --> 01:43:58,598
- Really?
- Yes.

1102
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:05,471
Man:
<i> Okay. Come back.</i>
<i> Dry him out.</i>

1103
01:44:05,473 --> 01:44:06,672
- Very good.
- He's all right.

1104
01:44:06,674 --> 01:44:07,974
Hey, hey!
How's that going?

1105
01:44:07,976 --> 01:44:10,509
You don't know shit
about my parents.

1106
01:44:10,511 --> 01:44:13,813
- Money. Honor's more
important than money.
- Speaking of shit.

1107
01:44:13,815 --> 01:44:17,450
Why are you shitting
in front of Johnny?

1108
01:44:19,286 --> 01:44:21,520
Whoo! Whoo!

1109
01:44:21,522 --> 01:44:22,688
Push! Push!

1110
01:44:25,393 --> 01:44:26,993
Whoa,
I'm falling off.

1111
01:44:26,995 --> 01:44:29,562
Victor wong will
see to it ow nev--

1112
01:44:29,564 --> 01:44:31,330
- give it to me.

1113
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:37,637
What are you doing?

1114
01:44:37,639 --> 01:44:38,804
What are you
trying to do?

1115
01:44:44,378 --> 01:44:46,846
La la la la.
I'm okay.

1116
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:50,883
-<i> Now. </i>
- What?

1117
01:44:53,587 --> 01:44:54,787
I-- I got to get
a better angle.

1118
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:55,988
Why-- why you
can't do the..

1119
01:44:57,392 --> 01:44:59,325
You make me
run again.

1120
01:44:59,327 --> 01:45:00,826
- You missed.
- Huh? No.

1121
01:45:00,828 --> 01:45:01,994
Ah!

1122
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:09,669
- Good job.
- Great job.

1123
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:15,441
One take.

1124
01:45:15,443 --> 01:45:16,609
Perfect.

1125
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:34,393
BMW x5,
300 horsepower.

1126
01:45:34,395 --> 01:45:35,895
27 miles
to the gallon.

1127
01:45:35,897 --> 01:45:37,730
What are you doing?
You're doing a commercial?

1128
