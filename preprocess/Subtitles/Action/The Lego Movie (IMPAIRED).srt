WYLDSTYLE: Your home, Bricksburg,
is one of many realms in the universe.

482
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,797
There's also this one...

483
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,490
<i>Pirate's Cove, Knight's Club,
Viking's Landing, Clown Town...</i>

EMMET: Mm-hm.

486
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,686
Lord Business, or as you
think you know him...

487
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,971
President Business...

488
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,066
stole the Kragle, the most
powerful object in the universe.

489
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,977
Blah, blah, blah.

490
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,026
Proper name. Place name.
Backstory stuff.

491
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,490
- ...Piece of Resistance is The Special.
- EMMET: Mm-hm.

492
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,110
I'm so pretty. I like you.

493
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,658
But I'm angry with
you for some reason.

494
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,156
- ...tower at the end of the universe...
- EMMET: Mm-hm.

495
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,265
put the Piece of Resistance
onto the Kragle...

496
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,993
and disarm it forever.

497
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,210
Great.

498
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,499
I think I got it...

499
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,792
but just in case...

500
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,585
tell me the whole thing again.
I wasn't listening.

505
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,760

order and perfection.</i>

509
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,142
<i>And he stole the mysterious...</i>

- BUSINESS: The Kragle!

511
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,794
<i>WYLDSTYLE:
And he hired Bad Cop...</i>

512
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,895
<i>to hunt down all the MasterBuilders,
who were always changing everything.</i>

And we search for the
Piece of Resistance.

516
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,417
The only thing that
can stop the Kragle.

517
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,831
Kragle. I know that.

518
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,125
It might have been that cop.
He said something about the Kragle.

519
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,544
President Business was
going to use the Kragle...

520
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,151
to end the world in three days.

521
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,452
I can't make any sense of it.

522
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,677
Taco Tuesday.

523
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,092
I knew that was suspicious.
There's no time to lose.

524
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:24,308
We must find Vitruvius and get to the
Office Tower before it's too late.

525
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,551
Okay.

526
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,929
Heh. How scary can
someone's office be?

527
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,522
(THUNDER CRASHES AND WOLF HOWLS)

528
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,468
President Business, we're trying
to locate the fugitive...

529
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,990
but his face is so generic it matches
every other face in our database.

530
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,782
Diabolical.

531
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,999
Okay, have Bad Cop meet
me in my office...

532
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,841
- ...in 23 seconds. Ciao.
- Will do, sir.

533
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,832
BUSINESS ROBOT: Coffee sales
are through the roof, sir.

534
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,397
Glad to hear it. Let's rebuild
that roof to be even higher!

535
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,748
The roof team is on it.

536
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,217
Sir, can you approve this
poster for Taco Tuesday?

537
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,506
Perfect. Whoo!

538
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,504
- I love everyone in this room.
- ROBOTS: We love you, sir!

539
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,177
- BUSINESS: Great job on the radio station.
- RADIO ROBOTS: Thank you, sir.

540
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,471
We love listening to this
song over and over again.

541
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,513
Keep it up, guys.

542
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,762
Honey, where are my...

543
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,079
- pants?
- AUDIENCE: Ha-ha-ha!

544
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,227
Cut! Ha, ha!

545
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,100
Hilarious. That never gets old.

546
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,272
It does not.

547
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,861
Bad Cop is waiting for
you in your office.

548
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,355
Wonderful. Fantastic.

549
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,403
Would you cancel my 2:00?

550
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,777
This next meeting could
run a little bit...

551
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,027
deadly.

Bad Cop.

557
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,296
Lord Business. I know The
Special got away, but...

558
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,298
Don't be so serious.

559
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,674
Where's the other guy?

560
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,768
- Hey, friend.
- BUSINESS: Hey, buddy!

561
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,762
- I missed you.
- Aw, did you really?

562
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,663
Have I ever shown you
my relic collection?

563
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:54,936
Nope. I don't think you have.

564
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,822
Nobody knows where
this stuff comes from.

565
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:57,893
This one...

566
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,611
is the Cloak of Ban Da'ld.

567
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,337
I hear it's super
painful to take off.

568
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,985
- You wanna try it on?
- Well, um...

569
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,700
No, but thank you.

570
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,445
BUSINESS: We've done some great work
over the years together, Bad Cop...

571
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,572
capturing all those
MasterBuilders...

572
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,449
and torturing them and whatnot.

573
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,416
Thank you, sir.

574
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,705
Although...

575
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,435
you did let the Piece
of Resistance go.

576
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,163
The one thing that
can ruin my plans.

577
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,733
(CHUCKLING) The one thing that
I asked you to take care of.

578
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,967
That's super frustrating.

579
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,928
It makes me just wanna
pick up whoever...

580
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,968
is standing closest to me...

581
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,932
and throw them through
this window...

582
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:32,849
and out into the infinite
abyss of nothingness!

583
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,774
I wanna do it so bad.

584
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,065
I know you do, sir. Please don't.

585
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,610
And it's not just you, Bad Cop,
that keeps messing up my plans.

586
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:47,486
People everywhere are always
messing with my stuff.

587
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,579
But I have a way to fix that.

588
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,242
A way to keep things exactly the
way they are supposed to be.

589
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,581
Permanently.

the Kragle in a big machine upstairs.

596
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,306
I call it...

597
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,056
the Tentacle Arm Kragle
Outside Sprayer.

598
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,603
Or TAKOS.

599

The "S" is silent.

600
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,653
So on Taco Tuesday...

601
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,068
it's going to spray the Kragle
over everyone and everything...

602
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,693
with a bunch of super-scary
nozzles like this one!

603

- I'll show you how it works.
- Sir, I don't know if this is necessary.

604
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,373
Oh, don't worry.
I won't test it on you.

605
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,117
I'll do it on your parents!

606
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:38,289
BAD COP: What?

607
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,003
- Hi, son.
- Hi!

608
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,747
How's it going in the big city?

609
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,125
Mommy. Daddy. What
are you doing here?

610
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,797
Okay, Pa. I just want
you to act naturally.

611
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,092

- Gotcha.

612
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,806
Yeah. Keep your hand up like that.

613
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:51,890
Ma, scoot...

614
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,805
two steps in to the right.

615
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,974
- Pa, whenever I talk to Ma...
- Uh-huh?

616
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,495
- ...you start to move.
- Sorry, sir.

619
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,351
That's great. You can't do anything better.
No reason why you should move.

620
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,102
Right.

621
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:03,853
Now, Ma...

622
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,605
hand on his shoulder. And you...

623
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,198
- Pa, you just moved and you've just wrecked it!
- Uh-huh.

624
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,111
You wrecked it!

625
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:11,531
Bad Cop, you see what
I'm talking about?

626
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:15,532
All I'm asking for
is total perfection.

627
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,203
Send in a Micro-manager!

628

And then...

632
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,172
I just spray them...

633
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,638
with the TAKOS.

634
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,555
Oh, Pa, hold me.

635
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,896
Oh, darling, I can't move me legs.

636
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,140
- Does that upset you, Bad Cop?
- Um...

637

Of course not. Not if you
keep telling him he can't.

original thought. In his life.

Ha, ha. That's not true.

I wanted to have...

746
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,122
a bunch of my friends
over to watch TV...

747
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:11,790
Not unlike this TV that
just showed up magically.

748
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,878
And not everybody can
fit on my one couch...

749
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,202
and I thought to myself:

750
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,294
"What if there was such a
thing as a bunk bed...

751

Introducing the
double-decker couch.

753
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,180
So everyone could watch TV
together and be buddies!

754
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,088
That is literally the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,644
Please, Wyldstyle,
let me handle this.

756
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,730
That idea is just the worst.

757
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,691
There must be something
around here...

758
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,105
that proves his potential.

00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,774
If The Man Upstairs chose
him to be The Special...

760
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,146
there must be a reason.

00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,797
- EMMET: Who's The Man Upstairs?
- See?

762
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,549
He doesn't even know
about The Man Upstairs.

763
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,027

when I touched the Piece.

so it wasn't really a dream.

I did?

774

MasterBuilders spend years...

00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,615
training themselves to clear
their minds enough...

00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,970
to have even a fleeting glimpse
of The Man Upstairs...

777
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,894
and yet, your mind is already
so prodigiously empty...

778
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,144
that there is nothing in it to
clear away in the first place.

779
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,485
With proper training...

780
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,147
you could become a
great MasterBuilder.

781
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,319
I could?

VITRUVIUS:
The prophecy chose you, Emmet.

783
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,028
But I can't do any of the stuff...

784
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,038
that the prophecy says
I'm supposed to do.

785
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,875
All you have to do is to believe.

786
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:34,785
Then...

787
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,713
you will see everything.

Are you ready, my son?

Yes, I am.

00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:46,839
I think.

791
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,886
Then we haven't a moment to lose.

792
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,600
We must assemble...

793
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,602

- Well, we're still alive.
- Yeah!

1276
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,548
Heh. The double-decker couch.

1277
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,512
It wasn't totally
pointless after all.

1278
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,598
It's the one thing
that stayed together.

1279
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,592
I always believed in you, Emmet.

1280
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:44,641
I don't mean to spoil the party,
but does anyone else notice...

1281
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,106
we're stuck in the middle
of the ocean on this couch?

1282
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,224
I mean, it's not like a
big gigantic ship...

1283
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,852
is gonna come out of
nowhere and save us...

1284

Ye are!

1288
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,705
Did ye not hear me whole story...

1289
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:15,175
circumscribing the folly
of this whole enterprise?

1290
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,761
Well, it's kind of hard not to hear
when you're yelling everything.

1291
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,425
So why did you come back?

1292
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:22,049
This be-doubled land couch.

1293
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:26,975
I watched Lord Business'
forces completely overlook it.

1294
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,349
Which means we need
more ideas like it!

1295
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:30,269
Oh, thank you.

1296
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,439
Ideas so dumb and bad...

1297
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:36,564

they could possibly be useful.

1302
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,917
what's the last thing Lord Business
expects MasterBuilders will do?

1303
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:53,883
Build a spaceship?

1304
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:54,639
Kill a chicken?

1305
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:55,632
Marry a marshmallow.

1306
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,466

keep 'em down on the farm?</i>

1310
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,037
- Don't like that.
- Sounds weird.

1311
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,099
Now, listen. Wait, listen.

1312
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:14,026
Guys, you're all so
talented and imaginative.

1313
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:17,605
But you can't work
together as a team.

1314
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,732
I'm just a construction worker.

1315
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:23,953
But when I had a plan and we
were all working together...

1316
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,743
I mean, we could
build a skyscraper.

1317
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,585
Now, you're MasterBuilders.

1318
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:35,832
Just imagine what could
happen if you did that.

1319
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,213
You could save the universe.

1320
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:42,384
Well said, Emmet. Well said.

1321
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:43,634
Really?

1322
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:46,179
She be a fine speech there, laddie.

1323
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,801
Okay.

1324
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,764
Somebody get me some markers...

1325
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:55,601
some construction paper...

1326
00:54:57,711 --> 00:55:00,439
and some glitter glue!

1327
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,193
I call this:

1328
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,537
"Emmet's plan to get
inside the Tower...

1329
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,429
put the Piece of Resistance

1330
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,998
...and save the world."

1331
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,413
I've built a hundred just
like them back in the city.

1332
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:15,371
If we can just get in, I know where
the air ducts and wiring are located.

1333
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:16,543
I can get us anywhere.

1334
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,005
How will we get inside?

1335
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:19,833
In a spaceship.

1336
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,677
- Spaceship! Ha, ha!
- Great idea. A Bat-Spaceship.

1337
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,048
No, they're expecting
us to show up...

1338
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:28,517
in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate spaceship
or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship.

1339
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,034
One of those sounds awesome to me.

1340
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,183
My idea is to build a spaceship...

1341
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,103
that's exactly like all the other
Octan delivery spaceships.

1342
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,523
So not the special spaceship that I'm
building for all of you right now?

1343
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,146
Sorry, Benny. Maybe next time.

1344
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,274
Ooh, you're really letting the
oxygen out of my tank here.

1345
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,690
Yeah, but according to your
precious instructions...

1346
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,320
this ship needs a hyperdrive.

1347
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,530
We don't have that part.

1348
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,656
Maybe we could find one!

1349
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,432
What do you think, a spaceship is
just gonna appear out of the blue?

1350
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,625
Are you kidding me?

1351
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,960
The same thing!

1352
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:01,508
- Chewie!
- Mm!

1353
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,128
We're supposed to be halfway
to Naboo for a sweet party!

1354
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,051
This hyperdrive keeps
malfunctioning...

systems like this.</i>

1356

Captain Solo, we must go.

1357

You know how perturbed I get
if we are not punctual.

1358

The Droid's right. Let's roll.

1359
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,431
Now hold on, Han.

1360
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,104
This might be the right
galaxy after all.

1361
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,648
Because I see a heavenly body.

1362
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:24,398
Ooh, whoa, I have a boyfriend.
And it is super serious. Right, babe?

1363
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:25,991
- Of course it's serious.
- Yeah!

1364
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,156
- Got room for just one dude?
- Whoa! Babe!

1365
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,450
If he's a cool dude like you.

1366
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:31,817
You're trying to bail on us!

1367
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:32,656
I'm not trying to bail!

1368
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,658
You asked them if you could go
with them on their party ship!

That thing is filled
with bon vivants.

You speak French now?

1371
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:40,665
Babe, look, if this relationship
is ever gonna work between us...

1372
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,291
I need to feel free to party...

1373
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,483
with a bunch of strangers
whenever I feel like it.

1374
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,085
What?

1375
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,052
Babe!

1376
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,097
I will text you.

- No way.

You really had me there!

did was play space checkers.
