156
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:53,027
No, impossible.
Tell them I need my normal lead time.

157
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,696
Where?

158
00:10:56,448 --> 00:11:00,451
I'm getting a black-cat, Friday-the-13th
kind of feeling about this one.

159
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,827
It's in Detroit.

160
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,831
You can take care of business and
stop by Grosse Pointe for your reunion.

161
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,336
Look, Sergeant Pepper.
I really need you to shut up about that.

162
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,713
Sir, it's out of my hands.

163
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,715
The gods want you to go back home,

164
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,592
and they want you to delete someone
while you're there.

165
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,221
Would you describe their position
on this matter as inflexible?

166
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,098
Intractable, sir.

167
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,518
I've booked you on an early flight
tomorrow morning.

168
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,686
Dossier.

169
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,483
All right, listen.
I'm gonna call you from Detroit,

170
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:38,072
and just make sure that you pick up
the dry cleaning and feed the cat, okay?

171
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,909
- Don't forget your identity.
- All right, thank you.

172
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,206
(HEAVY SIGHING)

173
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,626
Could you tell Dr. Oatman
that I'm on my way?

174
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,128
- Oh, yes, of course.
- All right?

175
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,631
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

176
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,009
I got invited to
my 10-year high school reunion.

177
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,637
I'm conflicted.
I mean, I don't know if I really wanna go.

178
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,430
It's in Detroit. You know, I grew up there,

179
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,765
but I just honestly
don't know what I have

180
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,434
in common with those people anymore.

181
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,770
I mean with anyone, really.

182
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,898
I mean,
they all have husbands and wives

183
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,483
and children and houses and dogs.

184
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,527
They've all made themselves
a part of something.

185
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,738
And they can talk about what they do.
And what am I gonna say?

186
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,991
"I killed the president of Paraguay
with a fork.

187
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,327
"How have you been?"

188
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,621
I'm just thinking it would be depressing.

189
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,456
It would be depressing.

190
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,793
Shouldn't you be taking notes
or something?

191
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,671
I'm not taking notes, Martin,
because I'm not your doctor.

192
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,589
Please don't start with that stuff again.

193
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,300
Martin, I'm emotionally involved
with you.

194
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,969
How are you
emotionally involved with me?

195
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,262
- I'm afraid of you.
- Afraid.

196
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,597
That constitutes emotional involvement.

197
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,434
It would be unethical to work
with you under those circumstances.

198
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,019
Think you're upset
because I told you what I do for a living,

199
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,730
you got upset, and you're letting it
interfere with our dynamic?

200
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:54,815
Whoa!

201
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,234
Martin, you didn't tell me
what you did for a living.

202
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,153
- Yes, I did.
- You didn't tell me what you did

203
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,656
for a living for four sessions.
Then you told me and I said,

204
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,991
"I don't wanna work with you."

205
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,036
And yet you come back every week
at the same time.

206
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,663
That's a difficulty for me.

207
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,832
On top of that,
if you have committed a crime

208
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,667
or if you're thinking about
committing a crime,

209
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,628
- I have to tell the authorities.
- I know the law, okay?

210
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,340
But I don't wanna be withholding.
I'm very serious about this process.

211
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,011
- And I know where you live.
- Oh, now, see?

212
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:27,473
That wasn't a nice thing to say. That
wasn't designed to make me feel good.

213
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,766
That's a kind of a
not-too-subtle intimidation,

214
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:34,021
and I get filled with anxiety when
you talk about something like that.

215
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,814
- I mean, that's...
- I was just kidding.

216
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,066
- The thought never crossed my mind.
- You did think of it.

217
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,735
You thought of it and then you said it.

218
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,945
And now I'm left with
the aftermath of that,

219
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,073
thinking, "I gotta be creative
in a really interesting way now

220
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,951
"or Martin's gonna blow my brains out."
You're holding me hostage here.

221
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,120
- That's not right.
- I just wanna work.

222
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,206
There's some issues that I need to
work on in my life.

223
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,000
I've read your books.
Your bestsellers on the top 20.

224
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,418
They were both ghost-written, Martin.

225
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,504
- What, Annihilation of Death?
- Yeah.

226
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,464
Kill Who? A Warrior's Dilemma?
I read it.

227
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,800
- New York Times top 20.
- Well, I don't know what to say.

228
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,220
What do you say to other patients?
How does it work?

229
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,429
Ask me how I'm feeling.

230
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,432
- How do you feel?
- I'm feeling uneasy, man.

231
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,853
I'm just dispassionate, I'm bored, I'm...
It's hard to stay in a good mood.

232
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,688
I have problems at work.

233
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,359
You know, concept-execution stuff.
And I'm just ill at ease.

234
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,278
I don't wanna suggest anything
that might be uncomfortable for you,

235
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,616
but you might consider, just consider
the possibility that part of your problem,

236
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,493
part of the thing
that's making you so miserable,

237
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,578
is the angst of killing a lot of people.

238
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,956
Maybe I'll just
put it in the background there.

239
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,582
Come on. If I show up at your door,

240
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,044
chances are you did something
to bring me there, okay?

241
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,338
- I don't care about that stuff.
- You don't care about what stuff?

242
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,589
You know, the morality.

243
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:43,674
Hmm.

244
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,009
I don't want to talk about work.

245
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,136
Because I don't think necessarily
what a person does for a living

246
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,097
reflects who he is.

247
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,474
So what do we do?
Do we talk about dreams?

248
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,017
What's next? What's the score?

249
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,270
We'll talk about dreams. It's your nickel.

250
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,773
Sure. I had another one about Debi.

251
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,942
That girl you're obsessed with?

252
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,902
Don't you think "obsessed"
is a strong word?

253
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:08,031
Recurring dreams of loss and pain
for 10 years featuring the same person?

254
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:12,077
Yeah, maybe it's a bit obsessive.

255
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,789
I had one where I was
that television mechanical rabbit.

256
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,667
- You know, with the...
- The battery bunny.

257
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,127
Yeah. I was the bunny.

258
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,212
That sounds like a very,
very depressed dream.

259
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,880
- Really? Why?
- Yes.

260
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,382
Martin, it's a terrible dream.

261
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,676
It's depressing to
dream about that rabbit.

262
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,345
It's got no brain, it's got no blood.
It's got no anima.

263
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:33,932
It just keeps banging on those
meaningless cymbals endlessly,

264
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,893
and going and going and going.

265
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,688
- Time is up.
- Time's up already?

266
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,815
You really wanna do half a session?

267
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,737
Can we just pretend like we have
a normal doctor-patient relationship?

268
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,656
I'll ask you a piece of advice,
you give me an answer.

269
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,658
You know, advice.
Should I go to the reunion?

270
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,703
- Yes, yes, get out of town.
- Thank you.

271
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,122
Go see some old friends,
have some punch.

272
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,790
- Visit with what's-her-name.
- Debi.

273
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,209
Debi. Don't kill anybody for a few days.

274
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,961
- See what it feels like.
- Give it a shot.

275
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,256
No, no, don't give it a shot.
Don't shoot anything.

Now, my advice is, you wait till he gets
the witness, and then you guys do him.

- No, actually, as a matter of fact,

306
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,741
I actually talked to him in Bonn.

307
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,869
You always...
You always have to know everybody.

308
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,704
Tell you what.
Why don't I take the weekend off

309
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,581
and you kill him,
since you two are so close?

310
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,207
All right, I'll do that.

311
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:08,628

Hi, I'm Debi Newberry.

This is WGPM FM, Grosse Pointe,
Window on the Pointes.

315
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,601
You heard from Massive Attack,
Public Enemy, Morphine,

316
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:27,397
that's my personal favorite,
and Duane Eddy's twangy guitar.

317
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,191
Good to hear
Toots and the Maytals, huh?

318
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:34,613
And as you know, this weekend is
Pointes High class of '86 reunion.

319
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,490
So in honor of this momentous event,

320
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,743
I'm making this an all-'80s,
all-vinyl weekend.

321

00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,833
on all this reunion-related nonsense.

323
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,253
Hey, I know everybody's coming back
to take stock of their lives.

324
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,421
You know what I say?

325
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,090
Leave your livestock alone.

326
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,259
Kick back and relax, and ponder this.

327
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,806
Where are all the good men dead?

328
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,267
In the heart or in the head?

329
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,186
So here's another cold cup of coffee
from The Clash.

How you get a rude and a reckless?

Don't you be so crude and a feckless

I went to the market to realize
my soul

00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:53,733
What I need, I just don't have

341
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:59,155
First they curse, then they press me
till I hurt

We say Rudie can't fail

- It's you.
- Hey.

Oh, God.

347
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:16,172
You've been Detroit's most famous
disappearing act since white flight.

348
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,341
You look exactly the same, Mrs. K.

349
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,511
- You look great is what I mean. Great.
- Thank you very much, Martin.

350
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,471
You have always been
very good at saying that

351
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,265
and not sounding like a kiss-ass.

352
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,767
So what happened?

353
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,854
I mean, we thought Princeton, Harvard.

354
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,024
You fooled us all
in the teachers' pool and went nowhere.

355
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,817
I guess you could say I went west,
you know?

356
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,445
The way of Horatio Alger,
Davy Crockett, the Donner party.

That's a barrage of imagery.

Are you still, you know, inflicting
all that horrible Ethan Frome damage?

- Is that off the curriculum?
- It's off.

360
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,372
- That's a horrible book.
- That's a very nice tie you have on.

361
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,625
You look like a mortician. I mean...

362
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,751
- You like it?
- Yeah, thanks.

363

You still got that
Mary Tyler Moore thing.

Thank you, thank you. That's enough.

- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

- I'm going home.

Are you?

- Gosh, well, they're playing my song.
- All right.

When you were young
And your heart was an open book

00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:24,491
You used to say, "Live and let live"

you know you did

in which we live in

- Couple of months.
- Yeah?

Is there a manager here?
Do you have a supervisor?

- No, but...
- How long have they worked here?

463
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,271
No, I'm just kidding.

464
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:29,814
(GASPS)

465
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,025
Hi.

466
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,237
Uh...

467
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:40,033
And here's The Specials,

468
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,786
doing one of their songs.

469
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,585
It's Martin.

470
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,588
I know who you are.

471
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,756
You're not dead.

472
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,468
- Hi.
- Hi. Shake my hand.

473
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,303
How are you?

474
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:02,847
Wow.

475
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,408
How... How are you?
It's good to see you.

476
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,036
You look great. How long has it been?
Ten years?

477
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,412
How long has it been?

478
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,665
Since you stood me up on prom night
and vanished without a word?

479
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,126
Yeah, 10 years I think.

480
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:33,628
Yeah.

481
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,757
You tell me about yourself.

482
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:42,887
In California, travel a lot
around on business.

483
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,389
- That's it?
- Yeah.

484
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,349
That's 10 years?

485
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,393
Yeah.

486
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,937
I would hope for a great abduction story
or something.

487
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,356
I've had a few thrilling moments
here and there,

488
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,817
but, you know, it flew by.

489
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,611
So, what's your business?

490
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:00,822
Professional killer.

491
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,243
- Do you get dental with that?
- No.

492
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:12,333
I gotta go. So you're working?
It's a great... I mean, it's a great show.

493
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,961
I've been listening.
I mean, since I got back into town.

494
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,131
- But I'll come back.
- What are the odds?

495
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:21,175
Very funny. I'll see you.

496
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,650
Someone has
come to me out of the past

497
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,194
reviving a feeling long since forgotten.

498
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:45,491
I know I should be mad, and I am.

499
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,372
- What's he doing?
- No clue.

500
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:57,503
He says cryptic things
and is gone abruptly again.

501
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,386
Oh, boy. What...
What is this I'm feeling here?

502
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,598
Is this pain? Is this panic?
Is it pleasure?

503
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,601
- Am I hungry? Who's hungry?
- Seventy-nine point five.

504
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,394
Okay, the first five callers will receive

505
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,105
a sentimental breakfast
from CuppaJoe's,

506
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,692
courtesy of the long-lost love of my life.

507
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,196
The man who vanished.

508
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,536
The man who is walking
right back into the station

509
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,247
and into my booth.

510
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,836
Sit.

511
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:54,268
Okay, let's take a random day.
Spring of '86.

512
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:57,355
Two young lovers
with natural chemistry.

513
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,482
- (MOUTHING) I'm on the air?
- (MOUTHING) Yeah.

514
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:06,572
A girl sits in a $700 prom dress

515
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:08,491
on the steps of her house,

516
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,535
waiting for the most
romantic night of her young life.

517
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,373
The boy never shows up, not until now.

518
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,500
So, what's the question?

519
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,336
Where have I been?

520
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,712
More like,
"What happened, Mr. Blank?"

521
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,673
I don't know. I could venture a guess,

522
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,217
but it would sound like
a rationalization, a cop-out.

523
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,719
I thought coming home,
seeing some friends,

524
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,721
and I thought maybe seeing you,
of course,

525
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,432
would be the most important
part of that equation.

526
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,978
That didn't... That didn't come out right.
This... This isn't even my idea.

527
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:39,772
This whole thing
is my therapist's idea, really.

528
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,236
Is this bothering...

529
00:31:55,956 --> 00:32:00,251
Okay, so you're back a decade late,

530
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,545
and you're on some sort of
therapeutic assignment,

531
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,880
and you wanna sort things out with me.

532
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,717
So the question now becomes
do I allow you access to me,

533
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:11,304
- or do I call security?
- I don't think that'd be a good idea.

534
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,682
Grosse Pointe, I need your help,
555-WGPM.

535
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,767
Do you think maybe we could
get a cup of coffee,

536
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:19,145
and I could try to explain or apologize?

537
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:25,735
Come on, Marty, this segues
so nicely into my '80s weekend.

538
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,905
Should a once-brokenhearted girl
give a guy a second chance?

539
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,117
Let's go to the phones.

540
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,410
You're on the air.

541
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,579
- Hi, Debi, it's Gail.
- Oh, hi, Gail.

542
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,247
You know, I wouldn't take him back yet.

543
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:42,084
I'd make him jump through some hoops
for a while, walk over hot coals.

544
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:45,463
- Make him beg for it.
- Harsh. That's very harsh, Gail.

545
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,341
Do you think maybe we could
discuss this in a more discreet setting?

546
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,384
...beg like a beggar.
You know, come on.

547
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:52,762
Next caller, you're on the air.

548
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:56,265
Debi, man, it's Nathaniel.
I don't hear any real remorse.

549
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,851
I mean, I don't think I'd let
this guy back in your life.

550
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,562
And, dude, I'd make him
wear that prom dress.

551
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,939
DEBl: Does anybody else
have a question for Marty?

552
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,442
- I do, but he's a shifty one.
- Put that down.

553
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:10,237
I have a question for Marty.

554
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,324
- Next caller, you're on the air.
- Yeah, Debi, hi.

555
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,035
Long-time listener, first-time caller.
I love the show.

556
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,329
So, Martin, what, no yellow ribbons?

557
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,955
Didn't anybody miss you?

558
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,000
Don't you think you should tell her
why you're really in town, tough guy?

559
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:26,045
You know what we love?
We love tough guys like you.

560
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,174
Thanks. That was our own Michigan
Militia, with their latest chart topper.

561
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,968
Come on, people,
do I give this guy the time of day?

562
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,640
Marty, do you have any
deeply personal responses

563
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,684
- you wanna share with our listeners?
- (MOUTHING) No.

564
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,394
Okay, he's shaking his head no.

565
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,729
In radio, that usually signals
the end of the interview.

566
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,357
Grosse Pointe, Michigan,
I hear you loud and clear.

567
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,609
If you love something, set it free.

568
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:53,114
If it comes back to you, it's, well,

569
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,243
broken.

570
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,250
Damn it. Never trust my instincts.

571
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,446
Marty.

572
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,742
Paul.

573
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,327
- Don't leave me hanging, baby.
- Hey, man.

574
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,580
How the hell you doing?

575
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,542
Hey. Look at you.

576
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,043
- Walk with me, man.
- Sure.

577
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:50,087
- I got my car parked around the corner.
- Okay.

578
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:54,633
Yeah. Goddamn, I worried
you joined a cult or something, man.

579
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,093
Half expected you to
come back into town

580
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,887
in a fennel wreath and paper pants.

581
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:59,722
- No money in it.
- Says you.

582
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,975
- Look at you. You've gone respectable.
- I stopped pouting on the sidelines.

583
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,227
I got in the game,
joined the working week.

584
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,438
So why don't you valet park
your high horse, slick,

585
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,899
- and take it easy on your buddy?
- It was a cheap shot.

586
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:11,650
Yeah, it was.

587
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:15,112
- Man, let's catch up, huh?
- Yeah, let's catch up.

588
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:18,741
I got a real estate deal. I'm taking them
through a final walkthrough, you know.

589
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,576
- This your Beemer?
- Yeah.

590
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,744
In Detroit? That's sacrilege.

591
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,579
Well, you know, guess who I got it from?

592
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,457
- I have no idea.
- Bob Destepello.

593
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,751
- Bob Destepello sold you a car?
- Yeah, he did.

594
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,462
Didn't he break your collarbone
and steal your woman?

595
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,255
- PAUL: Yeah.
- BLANK: So you're in real estate, huh?

596
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,258
Yeah, I got a couple of newlyweds
with a decision-making disorder.

597
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:39,345
I'll just hold their hands
and reinforce their clarity.

598
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:42,181
Isn't there some sort of Frank Lloyd
Wright connection with this?

599
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,100
You know what? There is indeed.
For the life of me, I can't...

600
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,852
Blank!

601
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:54,443
Hey, Blank.

602
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,278
I was driving by, I saw you on the lawn.

603
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,281
I thought there was gonna be a problem
at first, before I recognized you.

604
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,742
Terry Rostand. How you doing? PHS.

605
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,036
Terry Rostand. Oh, yeah,
you were always the guy who was...

606
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,288
- Yeah, I remember you.
- Yeah, '86.

607
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,457
How you doing, man? You look good.
You became a cop.

608
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:11,126
- Nice badge.
- No, no, no. I'm not a peace officer.

609
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:12,628
This badge isn't
a meaningful symbol or anything.

610
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,463
It's a badge of my company.

611
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,341
We don't enforce the law, we execute
company policy for homeowners.

612
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,010
- I get it. Cool. Cool.
- Yeah.

613
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,805
- You mind talking a little shop?
- Sure.

614
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,849
When are you authorized
to use deadly force?

615
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,350
Well, you know, of course,

616
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,811
taxes provide your basic service,
police and whatnot,

617
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,646
but our customers
need a bit more than that.

618
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,732
So if we find you on the property,
you know, we do what we have to do.

619
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,735
So if I just look suspicious
on your customer's property

620
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:39,196
under those, you know,
heightened circumstances,

621
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,365
you have the authority to shoot me?

622
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,700
Correct.

623
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,910
Wow. All right, all right.
How'd you get the gig?

624

You know, they were hiring.

00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,331
- It was only a two-week course.
- Yeah, that's good.

when my time comes, if it ever does,

635

I want a wife like you.

another broker, are you?

639
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,781
Definitely not.

640
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,701

I don't think they're buyers though.

641

I don't know if you're qualified
to make that statement.

645
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,337
No, I was just driving by,
and, you know,

646
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,963
I saw some people milling
around the lawn here.

647
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,215
No, there was just me. I was right there.

648
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,259
Okay, that's what I thought.
I just came by.

649
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:45,304
I show people houses here,
and I'd appreciate if you don't show up.

- No, but you don't know the alarm code.

- Did you get a call?
- No, they go off.

653
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,980
Okay, you're gonna have to go.

654
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,732
I'm more a part of this
neighborhood than you are.

And besides, a lot of times

when you're checking,

- and the alarm goes off.
- Wow.

658
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,657
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

659

Well, I'm sorry about
the temporary thing...

- Yeah. They tore it down

- Yeah, I brokered the deal.

00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:34,398
- Yeah, okay.
- By the way, is this live, or, you know,

769
00:45:34,482 --> 00:45:36,775
- are we being broadcast again?
- Not right now,

770
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,778
but I tend to record everything
because you never know.

771
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,613
Right, right. That's a good point.

772
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,031
- I'll see you there.
- Okay.

773
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,618
I'd like to explain some things to you
and have a good...

774
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,832
Martin Blank.

775
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,136
- You seem very nervous.
- No, no, I'm not. It's just...

776
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,305
Why do you keep looking over
your shoulder?

777
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,392
No, I just don't like having my back,
you know... It's a habit.

778
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,353
Let's not talk about that.
I want to talk to you.

779
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:14,855
- Okay.
- Put the spotlight on you.

780
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:17,107
- Sure.
- You got married.

781
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:20,152
That's hard to imagine.
It's just unbelievable.

782
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:23,238
No, it's pretty normal, Martin.
It happens all the time.

783
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,158
It's not like you went away
for the weekend.

784
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:27,909
Can I ask you a question?

785
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,912
I mean, if it's too personal,
you don't have to answer it.

786
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,539
What happened?

787
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:34,749
I think...

788
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:37,335
I think I married him to get away.

789
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:39,629
Didn't like where I ended up.

790
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:40,964
What was the guy like?

791
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,425
It doesn't matter.
Just forget about that question.

792
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,969
Same thing happened to me
when I joined the Army.

793
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:50,140
- It's a marriage of sorts.
- On prom night. That's psychotic.

794
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,311
(LAUGHING) How could you possibly
join the Army?

795
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:58,064
It's something I felt I had to do.
I know it doesn't make any sense.

796
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,566
No, it doesn't make any sense.

797
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:03,236
Do you know how much time I spent on
this masochistic cycle just trying

798
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,697
- to figure out what I'd done?
- Nothing.

799
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,366
Yeah, well, you tell me that now.
A little late.

800
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:11,578
And I thought you'd been murdered
or brainwashed or...

801
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,455
At least I'd hoped that's what happened.

802
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,582
Sorry to disappoint you.

803
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,377
So, you know, come on, spill.
What you been doing the last 10 years?

804
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,422
Well, you must have experiences
you wanna tell me about.

805
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:24,549
- Bad experiences.
- You've met people?

806
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,011
- Bad people.
- You're pathetic. Know what you need?

807
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,930
- What?
- Shockabuku.

808
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,723
You wanna tell me what that means?

809
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:35,894
It's a swift, spiritual kick to the head
that alters your reality forever.

810
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,396
That'd be good.

811
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,315
I think.

812
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,236
Listen, I could pick you
up for the reunion around 7:00.

813
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:47,614
Wait a minute. Let me get this straight.
You are asking me

814
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:51,618
- to go as your date to the reunion?
- Yes.

815
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,622
- It's unbelievable.
- Well, you know, what the hell?

816
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,124
- I'm not even planning on going.
- Really?

817
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:02,462
Really. I'm... I was just gonna be mean
about them on the radio. You know?

818
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:05,006
- Yeah, yeah.
- Besides, it's gonna be depressing.

819
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,510
Maybe. But listen, if you wanna go,
I can't think of any reason

820
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,887
- why we wouldn't go together.
- I can.

821
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:13,014
I think you can open up, forgive a little.

822
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:15,517
I think it'd be good for you.
I'll be on time.

823
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,061
Showing up would be a big step.

824
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:22,857
- Well, I'll think about it.
- Really?

825
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,819
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. It's Marvin and Debi.

826
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,113
It's me, Amy.

827
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:29,864
- Amy.
- Yes.

828
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,324
You're still together?

829
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:35,328
Oh, God, you were the coolest couple.

830
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,621
(DRINK SPILLING)

831
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,206
Still are. I am so sorry.

832
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,709
- That's okay. No, God.
- Here. Want my drink?

833
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:43,795
- Don't worry about a thing.
- Debi, I love your show.

834
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,548
- It's so timeless.
- Yeah, it does run a little long.

835
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,342
- Marvin, are you here for the reunion?
- Sure.

836
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,220
- Where you been these last 10 years?
- Yeah, Marv, where you been?

837
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:53,680
You look great.

838
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,558
- I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
- You do not.

839
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,269
I do. I sell biscuits and gravy
all over the southland.

840
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,813
You're so funny. He's a funny guy.

841
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,357
You know Tim, my husband?

842
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,193
Why don't I get you another
drink and you can catch up?

843
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,487
Could I have a Stoli with three olives
and an onion?

844
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,740
- Yeah.
- I'll have what she's having.

845
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,408
Sure.

846
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,498
Hi.

847
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:29,799
Girl down there,
she doesn't trust me anymore.

848
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,593
I don't know why.

849
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,511
I'm trying to earn back her trust.

850
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:44,356
I'm gonna go finish my drink,
walk her to the car,

851
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,941
I'll be at the hotel in a half hour.

852
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,860
I'll see you there?

853
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,951
- That's him.
- Yeah, we know, thank you.

854
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:58,745
We've been following him around.

855
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,455
What's the problem here?
You guys on an hourly rate?

856
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,333
If we observe the subject
in an illegal act,

857
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,503
only then can we intervene
and terminate.

858
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:07,671
Yeah.

859
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,256
Why don't you just go
and shoot the fucker, huh?

860
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:13,259
Because we are not assassins,
Mr. Grocer.

861
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:16,388
- We work for the American government.
- Hey, he's coming back.

862
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:21,768
(MOUTHING) He's not coming back.

863
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:27,357
Fuck you guys.

864
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,610
- Hey, I don't appreciate being hosed.
- (LAUGHING)

865
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,363
You're exactly the same.

866
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,614
So are you.

867
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,283
- I am? How so?
- Just like I remembered you.

868
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,285
Yeah? Troubled?

869
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:42,414
I'm troubled? Yeah. I got...
I got a few problems. Don't you?

870
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,165
- Sure.
- Yeah? What'd you do?

871
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,917
I tried everything, you know.

872
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,837
I went to the nutritionist, the herbalist,
the psychiatrist.

873
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:53,216
- That's quite a list. Any of it work?
- I can't tell, but you gotta try, you know?

874
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,552
- It's your duty.
- Yeah, patriot, sure, sure.

875
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,471
- Yeah.
- So tell me more about your problems.

876
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:02,142
And I'll tell you about mine
and then we'll solve them tonight.

877
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,226
(LAUGHS)

878
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,186
Not so fast.

879
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:08,606
- You're still in the penalty box.
- Right, right, right.

880
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,569
Well, thanks for coming to see me.

881
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:17,115
- So is there a Mrs. Mysterio?
- No, but I have a very nice cat.

882
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,908
- Not the same.
- You don't know my cat.

883
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:20,368
It's very demanding.

884
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:23,913
- It? You don't know if it's a boy or a girl?
- I respect its privacy.

885
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:29,085
- Are you happy?
- Kind of.

886
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,463
- Really?
- Sort of.

887
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:33,339
We'll talk soon?

888
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,133
Okay.

889
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,140
That's a nice ride.
Nobody buys American anymore, huh?

890
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,114
(PHONE RINGING)

891
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,326
- Hello.
- Marcella, what do you got?

892
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:04,037
Hey, that town is hot.

893
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,581
I got the stink from
an assistant over at Rothschild's.

894
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:07,665
We prepped together.

895
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,210
I downloaded everything,
so just call it up.

896
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:12,003
I'm online.

897
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:18,343
We've got Steven Lardner, a.k.a. Steve,

898
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:21,179
and Kenneth McCullers,
no pseudonym.

899
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,765
Steve was a red-shirt tailback
from Ohio State.

900
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,976
McCullers, all-American wrestler
from Northwestern,

901
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:29,479
- MBA from the same.
- What are they doing here?

902
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,398
Well, they're domestic
covert operatives for the NSA,

903
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:36,027
up there as part of
a new get-tough-on-terror campaign.

904
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,239
They're looking for an Oswald,
a patsy to take the fall.

905
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,616
- Grocer fed them you.
- Grocer set me up?

906
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,201
- Surprised?
- No.

907
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:44,953
They were supposed to
catch you in the act,

908
00:52:45,037 --> 00:52:47,455
but I guess they weren't
quick enough, right?

909
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:52,585
- Who's the ghoul?
- Well, this guy is a badass.

910
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:55,129
Felix La Poubelle.

911
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,466
An accomplished amateur
with the Basque Nationalists.

912
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:01,094
A few odd jobs
with the Algerian separatists.

913
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:05,640
Went pro with a stunning debut
aboard an elite Caribbean cruise liner.

914
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,767
That's where I know him from.
He's an asshole.

915
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:09,644
Did loan-outs for LikkenBakken.

916
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:13,982
Enjoys Native American art,
ballroom dancing, pornography...

917
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,692
Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is he here for?

918
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:19,195
It's part of that Oregon snafu
with that dog, Budro.

919
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,532
You're gonna get out of there, right?
That's not right. You gotta get out.

920
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:25,577
- You're on a flight tonight, right?
- It isn't done.

921
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:27,996
This is not good.

922
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,164
I'll do it tomorrow, it's fine.

923
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:32,208
Sir, I'm beginning to
worry about your safety.

924
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,585
Look, I have to go.

925
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:36,671
Yeah, we all have to go sometime, sir,
but we can choose when.

926
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,299
No one chooses when.

927
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:07,679
(WITH A JAMAICAN ACCENT)
You can't come in.

928
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:11,975
Well, I was in the neighborhood,
so I just stopped by.

929
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,434
Wanted to say hi. Can I come in?

930
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:18,940
You can come in, but only for a second.

931
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,827
Unbelievable.

932
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,163
It's exactly the same.

933
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,166
It's a shrine. It's only temporary.

934
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,836
My apartment burned down
on Devil's Night.

935
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:41,879
Really.

936
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,465
So you never gave me an answer.

937
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,468
- I said we'd talk later.
- Well, this is later.

938
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,137
See, I figure if we go together,

939
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:51,055
we have a better chance
of getting out alive.

940
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:55,393
You know, we can partner up,
watch for traps, you know, go tandem.

941
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,311
I think it'd be a lot safer
than if we lone-wolfed it.

942
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,190
I have to say I'm curious
as to what 10 years has done to you.

943
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,400
You, too.

944
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,028
Is...

945
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,447
Is that the same bed?

946
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:08,823
Uh huh.

947
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,617
The magic bed.

948
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,746
The magic carpet. Wow.

949
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,668
I'll tell you what. I'll give you an answer
if you give me an airplane.

950
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:23,171
- Okay.
- Cool.

951
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,258
- Ready?
- Okay.

952
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,428
- Keep your feet low.
- I remember.

953
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,597
It's been 10 years.

954
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,433
- Fly, be free, be free.
- I'm flying.

955
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,684
(IN JAMAICAN ACCENT) Emancipation.

956
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:39,062
- Are you free?
- Of course. Okay.

957
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,230
- What if your dad comes in?
- You can give him one, too.

958
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,817
Okay. You can pick me up at 7:00.

959
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:48,863
Put me down. You can pick me up.

960
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:56,245
Okay, you can go now.

961
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,081
You want me to leave right now.

962
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:01,042
You don't wanna, maybe, watch CNN,
Crossfire, something romantic?

963
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:05,588
- No, airplane was quite enough.
- Okay, I'll go. That's fine, I'll go.

964
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,465
But this night, tomorrow night,

965
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:11,135
the reunion is gonna be
an important step

966
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:14,931
in our, you know,
burgeoning relationship.

967
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,266
You're a fucking psycho.

968
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:20,269
Don't rush to judgment
on something like that

969
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,105
until all the facts are in.

970
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,649
- I'll just let myself out.
- Go.

971
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:28,152
And, you can, you know,
lock the door behind me,

972
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,905
because, you know,
a lot of undesirables around.

973
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,407
I'll call you. I'll go.

974
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,086
Oh, shit, there he is.

975
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,677
Man, why don't we just do his job
so we can do our job

976
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,137
and get the fuck out of here?

977
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,722
What do you mean do his job?

978
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,933
What am I, a cold-blooded killer?
I'm not a cold-blooded killer.

979
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,435
- Now, wait a minute...
- No, you wait a minute.

980
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:05,189
You wanna kill the good guy,
but not be the bad guy.

981
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:09,443
Doesn't work like that. You gotta wait
until the bad guy kills the good guy,

982
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:11,946
then when you kill the bad guy,
you're the good guy.

983
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,116
So just to clarify,

984
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,952
if we do his job, we're the bad guys.

985
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:20,621
And if we do our job,
we're the good guys?

986
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:24,667
- Yes.
- That's great.

987
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,002
(BOTH LAUGH)

988
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,045
Hey, hey.

989
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,508
Hi, Mr. Grocer.

990
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,388
He's brown-bagging it today.

991
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,655
Easy there, chief.

992
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:58,868
I don't see "Hollow-point wound care"
on the menu.

993
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,412
Up, up, up.

994
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,790
What are you in Detroit for?
The Red Wings need a new goon?

995
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,628
Hi, my name is Melanie. Let me
tell you about some of our specials.

996
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:12,506
Today there's the Alfalfa on My Mind.
That's our featured omelet.

997
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:14,550
Or there's Gatsby's West Egg Omelet.

998
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:16,427
If in the mood for something different,

999
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,721
there's the
I Left My Heart in San Francheezie.

1000
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,932
- What'll you have?
- Two poached eggs.

1001
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:23,976
Scrape off the milky white stuff.
Hash browns well done.

1002
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,770
English muffin for the bread,
and a coffee.

1003
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,606
Wholegrain pancakes
and an egg-white omelet, please.

1004
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,191
What would you like in your omelet?

1005
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,236
- Nothing in the omelet.
- That's not technically an omelet.

1006
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,112
I don't wanna get in
a semantic argument.

1007
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,240
I just want the protein, all right?

1008
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,201
Come on there, ice man, live a little.

1009
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,453
Let Chef put a little cilantro
for your liver.

1010
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,956
- I don't want that.
- Little onions for the blood.

1011
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,085
- What are those?
- Nutrients.

1012
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,214
Here's the new stuff, kid. Durazac 15.

1013
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,716
Makes Prozac feel like a decaf latte.

1014
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:59,178
- You want a couple? I got jars.
- I don't do that stuff anymore.

1015
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:02,807
No wonder you got the shakes.
Don't say "do it," because I don't "do it."

1016
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:05,559
I ingest it on orders
from my neurophysiologist.

1017
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:08,688
It's legal. In five years,
they'll be putting it in the water

1018
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,731
- for the citizens, like fluoride.
- Fascinating.

1019
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,149
Is there anything
you wanted to talk about?

1020
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:13,859
I was gonna have breakfast.

1021
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,612
I heard about
that little blow-up at the Ultimart.

1022
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:19,282
- It was a wicked, ripping shame.
- One of your fraternal brothers?

1023
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:20,533
No.

1024
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:24,245
Hey, listen, I wanna work with you.
That was some indie frog.

1025
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,164
Some Basque whacker
from the Pyrenees.

1026
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,834
You sure Oregon doesn't ring a bell?

1027
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:33,004
Pacific Northwest,
a couple of months ago?

1028
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,299
Something about you doing
some wonder dog named Cujo?

1029
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,466
(SCOFFS)

1030
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:41,387
- Budro. Yes, Budro. Jesus Christ.
- Those dogs.

1031
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,348
Yeah, I was out there trying to whack
these three junk-bond fuckos.

1032
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:48,060
And these idiots were flushing game
with sticks of dynamite.

1033
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:51,022
And the dog that they borrowed,
little Budro, was a retriever. Get it?

1034
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,317
Budro was never a target.
Budro was acting on instinct.

1035
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:56,819
I would never hurt an animal.
I'm offended at the accusation.

1036
01:00:56,903 --> 01:01:00,031
Whoa, Chatty Cathy, clip your string.
I don't need to know.

1037
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,532
But just for the record,
here's what I heard.

1038
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:05,119
The marks borrowed
your client's prized hunting pup.

1039
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:08,622
So bad luck for Budro,
and bad luck for Blank.

1040
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:11,834
Poodle pumper. Hound hitter.

1041
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,962
- Pooch puncher.
- Let's not talk about Budro, huh?

1042
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:17,631
What about those two guys
in a Caprice Classic outside?

1043
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:20,301
The word is you turned
two governments on me, you turncoat.

1044
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:21,427
- Me?
- You.

1045
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,221
- Go G? On you? Never.
- Yes. Yes.

1046
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,351
Listen. Why don't we
get our relationship straight?

1047
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:31,312
I didn't get into this business
to have any relationships.

1048
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:34,440
I don't wanna join your goddamn union,
all right?

1049
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:37,360
Loner. Lone gunman. Get it?
That's the whole point.

1050
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:39,445
I like the lifestyle, the image.
Look at the way I dress.

1051
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:43,657
Become a cop or something.
Have coffee in the morning with friends.

1052
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,159
Look, this is a one-on-one business.

1053
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:48,954
The minute you start relationships,
bad things start happening.

1054
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,500
If it'll make you feel any better,
I think this is my last job.

1055
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:55,503
- I believe that.
- What do you say we put away our guns

1056
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:57,922
and forget the whole goddamn thing
and have some breakfast, all right?

1057
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,804
No scabs. From now on,
all arrangements, all contracts,

1058
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:07,390
- all engagements are regulated. Got it?
- Meet the new boss.

1059
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,100
- Yes.
- No deal.

1060
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,603
Okay. But we're not gonna let you
do your little job here.

1061
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:14,021
- No?
- No,

1062
01:02:14,106 --> 01:02:15,773
- because we're gonna do it for you.
- Is that right?

1063
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,817
After we do your job, we do another job.

1064
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,151
Tell me about it.

1065
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,112
I'm gonna put a bullet hole in your head.

1066
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:23,614
- I'm gonna fuck the brain hole.
- Nice talk, sugar mouth.

1067
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,660
- Hi.
- You had the not-a-omelet.

1068
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,954
(PLATES CRASHING)

1069
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,289
(HOOTING)

1070
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:41,966
(PHONE RINGING)

1071
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,218
Pacific Trident Global.

1072
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,469
Marcella, Oatman's
not returning my calls.

1073
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:47,430
I need you to find him right now.

1074
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:51,142
Try his office, try the car, try his club,
but I need you to find him.

1075
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:53,018
I'm already late for the reunion. Okay?

1076
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:54,728
- Okay.
- Patch him through the landline.

1077
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:57,231
- This thing's low on batteries.
- All right.

1078
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:04,905
Hi, how are you? Yeah.

1079
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:08,451
I'm a pet psychiatrist. Yeah, yeah.

1080
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:11,078
I sell couch insurance.

1081
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:14,206
And I test-market positive thinking.

1082
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:17,960
And I lead a weekend men's group.
We specialize in ritual killings.

1083
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:22,631
Yeah, you look great. God, yeah.
Yeah, hi, how are you?

1084
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:25,092
Yeah, how are you doing?
How are you? Good, hi.

1085
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:27,636
Hi, I'm Martin Blank, you remember me?

1086
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:31,432
I'm not married, I don't have any kids,

1087
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:34,727
and I'd blow your head off
if someone paid me enough.

1088
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:48,282
Oatman, listen, don't hang up.

1089
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,743
I didn't kill anyone.
Except some guy tried to kill me.

1090
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,537
If I see that guy again,
I'm gonna kill him, but not anyone else.

1091
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,207
Except the guy I was sent here to kill.
Anyway, I saw Debi.

1092
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:59,585
I'm on my way to the reunion with Debi.
I'm anxious, I wanna do a phoner.

1093
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:03,631
Okay. Repeat after me.
"I am at home with the me.

1094
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,550
"I am rooted in the me
who is on this adventure."

1095
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:09,720
I am at home with the me. I am rooted
in the me who is on this adventure.

1096
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:14,266
Good. Now take a deep breath
and realize that this is me breathing.

1097
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,352
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
I don't understand.

1098
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:18,062
You want me to say it, or to realize it?

1099
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,772
- What?
- That I'm breathing.

1100
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:23,067
- Say it.
- This is me breathing.

1101
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:25,402
Good. Now go do that
for about 20 minutes.

1102
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:26,987
- All right, I gotta go.
- Okay.

1103
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:28,697
Keep it up. Don't kill anybody.

1104
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:30,699
Right.

1105
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,586
This is me breathing.

1106
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:48,717
Yeah.

1107
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,889
You're a handsome devil.
What's your name?

1108
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,948
This is not happening again.

1109
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:53,157
Flowers.

1110
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,827
- That's funny.
- As long as I get the laugh.

1111
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:04,418
Debi, you look beautiful.

1112
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:07,504
Yeah? Thanks. Okay.

1113
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,174
Hold on.

1114
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:13,260
My dad's down the hall.
He's dying to say hi to you.

1115
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:14,428
Sure.

1116
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,138
I'll go put these in
some rubbing alcohol.

1117
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,806
Great.

1118
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,110
Mr. Newberry, it's Martin Blank.

1119
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:35,866
Good evening. How are you?

1120
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,577
- Good evening, Mr. Blank.
- Sir.

1121
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,621
You've beaten the millennia.
I lose my bet.

1122
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:43,290
Yeah, it was completely
unavoidable, sir, so...

1123
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:45,959
Just wanted to say hello, and,
you know, ask you how you are.

1124
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:47,878
- Martin.
- How's business, tricks?

1125
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:48,962
I don't know where you've been

1126
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:51,465
since you abandoned my daughter
10 years ago,

1127
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:55,094
and I don't care. It's good that you left.
I'm glad that you did.

1128
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:57,721
You've grown up a bit.

1129
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:01,266
Did I have you figured wrong?

1130
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,352
Well, I don't know. I mean, I hope so.

1131
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,270
I visualized you in a haze,

1132
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,815
as one of those slackster,
flannel-wearing,

1133
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,859
coffee-house misanthropes
I've been seeing in Newsweek.

1134
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:13,153
No, no, no, I went the other road.

1135
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:16,156
Six figures.
Doing business with lead-pipe cruelty.

1136
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,158
Mercenary sensibility, you know?

1137
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:20,494
Sports, sex,
no real relationships with anybody.

1138
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,079
How have the years been treating you?

1139
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:25,749
Well, you know me, Martin, the same
old sellout. Exploiting the oppressed.

1140
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:26,917
Sure.

1141
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:30,504
"What a piece of work is man
How noble..."

1142
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,005
Fuck it.

1143
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,757
Let's have a drink
and forget the whole thing.

1144
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,676
I'd love to, but we're a little bit late.

1145
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,303
So I just wanted to say hello
and wish you the best.

1146
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,472
What have you been doing
with your life?

1147
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:43,851
Professional killer.

1148
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:48,480
Good for you. It's a growth industry.

1149
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:54,111
Okay, good seeing you again.

1150
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,593
Neutralize. Did I say neutralize?

1151
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,470
I'll give you 20 bucks for that.

1152
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:22,848
STEVEN: Okay, he's definitely fallen
for her.

1153
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:26,268
- Look at him.
- Her hair looks really nice.

1154
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:27,394
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1155
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:33,275
No, he's using her.
What a cruel bastard.

1156
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,903
I'm gonna enjoy killing
that son of a bitch.

1157
01:08:35,987 --> 01:08:37,654
Me, too.

1158
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,491
- I should've worn a skirt.
- I should've brought my gun.

1159
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:43,368
- What?
- Should be fun.

1160
01:08:47,499 --> 01:08:49,875
- I'm not going.
- I'll go.

1161
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,676
Welcome back, Pointers.
It's Arlene Oslott-Joseph.

1162
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:03,514
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. I'm good.

1163
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:06,892
- Martin. Blank.
- Martin Blank.

1164
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:10,938
Yes, why, you haven't changed a bit.

1165
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:13,148
- Don't say that.
- Hi, Debi.

1166
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:16,819
- Just love your show.
- Thanks. Well, you're our demographic.

1167
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:20,447
- You gone and got married, Arlene.
- Yes, I did, and three children.

1168
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:22,950
- It's really neat.
- Yeah.

1169
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:24,785
I had the yearbook pictures put on,

1170
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,079
so everybody knows
who everybody was.

1171
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,039
A special torture.

1172
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:34,545
- Yeah. Hi, it's Arlene Oslott-Joseph.
- Oh, well.

1173
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:38,340
Bye-bye now, kids. Hi. Now, let's see.

1174
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:42,052
- Who needs hard liquor?
- Me. How are you holding up?

1175
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,887
- A little shaky.
- Straight to the bar for us.

1176
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:46,849
- I'm starting to remember these faces.
- What can I get you?

1177
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,559
- Vodka rocks, double. Two.
- You bet.

1178
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:50,936
When do we start relating to anybody?

1179
01:09:51,104 --> 01:09:54,064
I would say, any moment now.
Ken Alderosh.

1180
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,900
- Hey, hello, Martin.
- Hi, Ken.

1181
01:09:56,985 --> 01:09:59,778
- Hi, yeah, super. Hi, Debi, how are you?
- Hey, Ken. How are you?

1182
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,781
- Isn't this great?
- Yeah. What's been happening?

1183
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:04,825
- Moss, Bryce and Fromeyer.
- Yeah?

1184
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:09,329
In divorce mainly, some property,
some personal injury, you know.

1185
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:10,914
Those all seem kind of related.

1186
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:12,165
(LAUGHING) Hey!

1187
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,500
Hey, I'm gonna use that.

1188
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:15,043
- I'll take that line.
- Sure.

1189
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,588
Hey, let me give you a card here.
Wait a second.

1190
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:22,092
Actually, I've got a special one here
for top-shelf clients.

1191
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,511
- Don't forget to read the cap.
- Thanks a lot.

1192
01:10:24,596 --> 01:10:26,680
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Sure, sure.

1193
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,765
Martin Blank...

1194
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,310
- Sorry, man, you slipped. Sorry.
- Take it easy, man.

1195
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:34,646
- Sorry, sorry.
- Hey, Martin, what's happening, man?

1196
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,565
- It's Nathaniel.
- Hi, yeah, sure.

1197
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:38,859
How's it going, man?
Hi, Debi. How you doing?

1198
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,612
- Yeah, still very Newberry, I see.
- Oldberry, I think.

1199
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:42,905
- How's it going, man?
- Good.

1200
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:45,073
Come and say hey to Eckhart.
He's right over here.

1201
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:48,368
- Hey, thanks for the pen.
- You remember Jimbo and Peanut?

1202
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,662
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

1203
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,498
- How's it going?
- They're good. They're big, real big.

1204
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,876
I'm supervising their training, man.
They're going pro.

1205
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,671
Strictly Greco-Roman, man, all torso.
I'm taking them on the wrestling circuit.

1206
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,382
Yeah. Hey, I got something
for you guys.

1207
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:04,134
I don't hear any real remorse here.

1208
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:07,179
I don't think you should
get back together with this guy.

1209
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,556
- Real, man. You were real, man.
- That was cold, man.

1210
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:12,059
I don't mean any offense.
I was speaking from the heart.

1211
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:14,019
- All right.
- What are you doing later?

1212
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,063
We're gonna go outside
and blow a fat one.

1213
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,190
Get charred and toasted,
just like in high school.

1214
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,275
We gotta go see somebody over there.

1215
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,987
- We'll come back and get toasted.
- Come back, have a drink. Later, man.

1216
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,991
- How are you?
- Great.

1217
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:30,535
- What happened?
- I was just telling him.

1218
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:33,914
It was like I was
sucked up into the cosmos,

1219
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:38,543
all the while surrounded by
these yowling, nebulous forms.

1220
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:42,631
- Pardon me?
- And then, I got to the threshold.

1221
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:47,844
(CHOKING UP) Mozart, music,
flowers and poetry.

1222
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,263
- You died?
- And came back.

1223
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,683
See, that's the beautiful part.

1224
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,017
How did you die?

1225
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:58,146
I lost it on some ice
and ended up in Lake Saint Clair. Yeah.

1226
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,441
- Wanna go somewhere else?
- Sure.

1227
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:04,027
- Maybe we can dance later.
- Okay, sure.

1228
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:05,612
Okay, bye.

1229
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,449
Hey, you know, I'm gonna go
say hello to Amy over there.

1230
01:12:09,534 --> 01:12:11,535
- Okay.
- Okay.

1231
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:17,165
- Governor. How you holding up, baby?
- I don't know. How are you?

1232
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,251
Can't believe you haven't
cracked like a piñata.

1233
01:12:19,377 --> 01:12:20,627
- Almost.
- You look good.

1234

- You look Tony Robbins good.
- So do you, man.

1235
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:25,882
- How's that possible?
- I know, I know.

1236
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,551
Excuse me.

1237

- Hi.

1238

- You look great. It's Jenny Slater.
- Jenny Slater, yeah. How are you?

1239
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:37,060
- This 10 years has been good for you.
- It's been good for you, too.

- Paul?
- Yeah.

1243
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:47,571
Had 11 classes with you.
Did the precious metals paper for you.

1244
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:48,947
Oh.

1245
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:52,492
Okay. Well, I was looking
for some validation of my life,

1246
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:53,910
but apparently it came up short.

1247
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:56,329
- I thought that went well.
- It was good for you.

1248
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:58,498
- They said...
- How's the rest of the night been?

1249
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,083
It's been great. It's a festival of pain.

1250
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,086
The idea that they think
that you can't evolve.

1251
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,464
- But I'm saying that I...
- Excuse me.

01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:19,186
I don't wanna talk about the old days.
What did we have?

1258
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:21,229
- Archery.
- I couldn't stand that class.

1259
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:23,648
I appreciate you helping me...
Helping me hit my targets.

1260
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:24,858
- Sure.
- Check this out.

- I'm all right.

1266
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,580
So sit.

1267
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:41,083
So how you been?

1268
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,626
Great, I'm... I'm married.

- And...
- Robbie.

1270
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,339
- Yeah.
- And how is it all?

1271
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:48,882
It's not like it was supposed to be, right?

1272
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,425
No, no, that's not true.

1273
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:51,676
- No?
- It's great.

1274

- Really?
- I'm so great.

People think that when you get married
you lose your freedom.

- Not true?
- No, it gets better and better.

1277
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:02,062
So how are you?

1278
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:04,189
How's your life?

1279
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,816
- In progress.
- Yeah?

1280
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,778
- Will you hold Robbie for a sec?
- No, I...

1281
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,696
I'm gonna get his bottle. It's okay.

1282
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,740
Go ahead.

1283
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:15,992
You won't break him.

1284
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:19,496
You spend the first year just trying
to keep these little guys alive.

1285
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:22,457
Yeah, I imagine they'd be
very vulnerable to the elements.

1286
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:23,542
Yeah.

I know.

No, no, he'd love it.

no less than you deserve.

I think... I think I was overly harsh
when I said that you were broken.

Really? How so?

1331

I don't think you're broken.

No?

1333

- I think you're mildly sprained.
- What?

- Nothing that can't be mended.

01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:47,824
Something's missing.

1370
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:51,327
- Something.
- What?

1371
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:53,204
I know.

1372
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:57,000
Welcome home.

1373
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,839
I missed you.

1374
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:14,851
Welcome back, Pointer.

1375
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:17,187
It's Arlene Oslott-Joseph.

1376
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:18,813
And who might you be?

1377
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:21,024
It is I, Sidney Feldman.

1378
01:20:22,359 --> 01:20:24,360
Oh. Been overseas?

1379
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:30,200
My, you have changed. (LAUGHS)

1380
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:36,456
Save a dance for me, now.

1381
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,970
I think the best thing
would be to go away

1382
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:52,138
someplace quiet for a few weeks

1383
01:20:52,223 --> 01:20:54,557
and work this whole thing out.

1384
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,437
Where are you going?

1385
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:02,065
Well, you know, there's a few people
I should say goodbye to.

1386
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:09,197
I'm gonna go cruise by my old locker
and then I'll meet you in front.

1387
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,241
I'll find you.

1388
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,080
(CHUCKLING)

1389
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:25,380
- Hi, Bob.
- Debi Newberry, huh?

1390
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,507
You gonna hit that shit again?

1391
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,092
Fine, Bob, how are you?

1392
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:32,011
Real smart.

1393
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,389
Come on.

1394
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:37,016
Let's see how smart you are
with my foot up your ass.

1395
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:39,686
Do you really believe

1396
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:43,273
that there's some stored-up conflict
that exists between us?

1397
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,442
There is no "us."

1398
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:49,445
"We" don't exist.

1399
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,322
So who do you wanna hit, man?

1400
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:53,491
It's not me.

1401
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:57,870
What do you wanna do here, man?

1402
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,627
I don't know what that is.

1403
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:06,129
These are my words.

1404
01:22:06,297 --> 01:22:07,422
It's a poem?

1405
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:11,467
See, that's the prob...
Express yourself, Bob.

1406
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,136
Go for it.

1407
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:15,430
"When I feel quiet

1408
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:21,269
"When I feel blue..."

1409
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:26,399
You know, I think that is terrific,
what you have right there.

1410
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:28,484
Really, I like that a lot.
I wouldn't sell the...

1411
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:29,861
I wouldn't sell
the dealership or anything,

1412
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,821
but I'm telling you, it's intense.

1413
01:22:32,156 --> 01:22:33,740
- There's more.
- Okay.

1414
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:37,493
- Why don't you just skip to the end?
- To the very end?

1415
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:41,831
"For a while"

1416
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:44,667
That's good, man.

1417
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,170
- "For a while"
- That's excellent.

1418
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:50,381
- You wanna do some blow?
- No, I don't.

1419
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:55,345
There you go.

1420
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:57,555
- I missed you.
- Okay. I missed you, too.

1421
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:00,975
Okay.

1422

It wasn't me.

1425
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,338
Hey, what's going on?
What's going on?

1426
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:38,925
- Where's our boy?
- No.

1427

Hey, is that, is that his...
That guy's blood?

1428
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:50,812
Yeah.

1429

A thousand innocent people
get killed every day.

1430
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:55,191
Is this guy dead?

1431
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:58,736
But a millionaire's pet gets detonated
and you're marked for life.

1432
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,367
Help me out here.

1433
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:08,371
Pull that down.

1434
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,210
How did he die?

1435
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:17,713
He's a notorious terrorist.
There's a contract out on my life.

1436
01:26:21,552 --> 01:26:22,677
- He's dead?
- He's dead.

1437
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:24,387
- He's dead?
- Yeah.

1438
01:26:24,972 --> 01:26:27,098
Are his feet covered?

1439
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:33,062
Here we go.

1440
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:36,148
Come on. Grab his feet.

- Whiskey.

Club soda.

this is Dr. Oatman.

1471
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:37,788
I am not available right now,

1472
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:41,542
but if you'd like to leave a message,
I will get back to you shortly.

1473
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:44,462
Dr. Oatman, it's Martin Blank.

1474
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:46,881
I want to tell you
I don't wanna work with you anymore.

Things are going well here,
better than expected,

1476

and I just don't really feel
like you're helpful in any way.

1477
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,180
I don't think you're serious
about the therapy.

1478
01:29:54,264 --> 01:29:58,726
And so I want you to take a deep breath

1479
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:02,772
and realize that this is me firing you.

1482
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:44,730
Yes.

1483
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:47,650
It wasn't the other way around?

1484
01:30:47,734 --> 01:30:48,859
No, no.

1485
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:50,653
That wasn't my intention.

1486
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:53,114
Is it something you've done?

1487
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:56,158
It's something I do

1488
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:58,160
professionally,

1489
01:30:58,328 --> 01:31:01,038
for about five years now.

1490
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:03,541
You were joking.

1491
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:06,085
People joke about the horrible things
that they don't do.

1492
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:08,504
They don't do them. It's absurd.

1493
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,172
When I left, I joined the Army.

1494
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:11,674
And when I took the service exam,

1495
01:31:11,842 --> 01:31:13,884
my psych profile fit a certain...

1496
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:16,887
Moral flexibility would be
the only way to describe it.

1497
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:20,099
I was loaned out
to a CIA-sponsored program.

1498
01:31:20,267 --> 01:31:22,685
And we sort of found each other.
That's the way it works.

1499
01:31:22,853 --> 01:31:26,021
- So, you... You're a government spook?
- Yes... I mean no.

1500
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:28,190
I was before, but I'm not now.

1501
01:31:28,441 --> 01:31:30,151
But that's all irrelevant really.

1502
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:32,903
The idea of governments, nations,
is public-relations theory.

1503
01:31:32,988 --> 01:31:35,447
I don't want the theories.
I wanna hear about the dead people.

1504
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:37,992
Explain the dead people.

1505
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:39,702
Who do you kill?

1506
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:41,287
Well, that's very complicated,

1507
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:43,372
but in the beginning, you know,
it matters,

1508
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:46,041
of course, that you have something
to hang onto,

1509
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:48,460
you know, a specific ideology
to defend, right?

1510
01:31:48,545 --> 01:31:51,088
I mean, taming unchecked aggression,
that was my personal favorite.

1511
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:52,715
Others liked "live free or die."

1512
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:53,841
But you get the idea.

1513
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,843
But that's all bullshit
and I know that now.

1514
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:57,887
You do it
because you were trained to do it,

1515
01:31:57,971 --> 01:31:59,263
you were encouraged to do it,

1516
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:04,310
and ultimately, you know,
you get to like it.

1517
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:09,732
I know that sounds bad.

1518
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:12,276
You're a psychopath.

1519
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:14,862
No, no, no.
A psychopath kills for no reason.

1520
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:18,073
I kill for money.
It's a job. That didn't sound right.

1521
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:20,367
Let me see if I can put it another way.

1522
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:24,038
If I show up at your door, chances are
you did something to bring me there.

1523
01:32:24,748 --> 01:32:26,916
Everybody's doing it.
It's like the natural order.

1524
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:29,710
I mean, the states do it.
Sometimes there's due process

1525
01:32:29,794 --> 01:32:32,546
and sometimes pilots
