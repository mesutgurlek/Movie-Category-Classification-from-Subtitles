KATIA:
The history of man is defined by war.

2
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,127
And war by the men who fight it.

3
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,125
What if we could create a better man?

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,245
Someone did.

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,180
The Agent Program was initiated
in August of 1967,

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,011
by a man named Peter Aaron Litvenko.

7
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,487
Its purpose was to create
the perfect killing machine.

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,608
Human beings without emotion
or fear or remorse.

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,922
The resulting subjects
were called Agents.

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,001
The program was a success.

11
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,801
But the price of creating men without
humanity was Litvenko's conscience.

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,764
Applying his brilliant mind
to his flight, he vanished.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,330
Fearing that it would be exposed,
the government shut down the program.

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,962
And surviving Agents
drifted into shadows.

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,243
Realizing its potential,
many tried to restart the program.

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,523
All failed.

17
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,684
So they focused their efforts
on finding the one man who could.

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,090
The task fell to Dr. Albert Delriego.

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,842
A ruthless and efficient man.

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,841
But Litvenko had disappeared,
and even he couldn't find him.

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,809
Then, six years into his search,

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,003
Delriego made an unexpected discovery.

23
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,561
A single photograph, which would
become the key to finding Litvenko.

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,685
No one had ever imagined that,
in the end,

25
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,041
it would come down to one little girl.
