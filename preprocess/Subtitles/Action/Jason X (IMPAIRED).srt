00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,960
<i>- then move on.
- My pleasure, Professor.</i>

158
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,960
Ready phase two.

159
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,720
Bring on the ants.

160
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,840
That's it.
Come to mama.

161
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,040
Temperature 96.2. 97.

162
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,760
- Cool. It's working.
- 98.6 and holding.

163
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,720
Cell reconstruction
is complete.

164
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,240
Internal defib
in three...

165
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Two, one.

166
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,400
Easy, easy.

167
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,880
Vital signs are normal
and strong.

168
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,040
No shit.

169
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,600
Easy, easy.

170
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,960
Did you get him?
Where is he?

171
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,720
- Tell me you got him.
- Got who?

172
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,280
No one's here.
You're safe with us.

173
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,960
There was a leak
in the cryo unit and...

174
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,320
<i>- Was he contained?
- Was contained.</i>

175
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,480
<i>But when the cryo unit ruptured,
you didn't escape it.</i>

176
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,640
<i>It put you into stasis.</i>

177
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,840
For how long?

178
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,560
The year is 2455.

179
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,800
<i>Now, I know this is
a huge shock,</i>

180
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,760
<i>but you're going
to be safe here.</i>

181
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,240
You're aboard grendel. A class
four catamaran transport ship.

182
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,600
<i>We're on our way
back home</i>

183
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,720
<i>and you're gonna be
just fine.</i>

184
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,560
2455?

185
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,040
That's over 400 years.

186
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,600
Secure line.
Perez, dieter.

<i>[Beeping]</i>

189
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,200
- Lowe, you bastard.
- We've hit the motherlode.

190
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,160
- Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care.

191
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,160
- We've got a gold mine.
- A box of DVDs is not a gold mine.

192
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
I've told you
I can't move them.

193
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,320
Just look at the file.
Two 400-year-old specimens.

194
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,000
One well-preserved,
the other one--

195
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,560
are you ready for this?
Up and walking around.

196
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,320
400 years old
and walking around.

197
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,280
Yeah. 455 years,
to be exact.

198
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,000
Who cares?
Who gives a shit?

199
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,720
People. People will pay
huge money to see her.

200
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,680
Let me ask
you a question--

201
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,160
is this the first person
you've reanimated?

202
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,560
- Of course not.
- How many people are out there today

203
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,720
walking around,
thawed out and looking good?

204
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,400
- Hundreds.
- Thousands.

205
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,240
Maybe.
But not 450 years old.

206
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,320
<i>- She's twice as old as anyone on the planet.
- 250, 450.</i>

207
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
What's the difference?

208
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,080
Doctor, 100 years ago when re-animation

209
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,040
was more unpredictable,
sure, maybe.

210
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,000
- But now it's old news.
- Damn it. I need money.

211
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,280
I know, I know.

212
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,200
<i>The other viable
is marked Voorhees.</i>

213
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,160
That's not
Jason Voorhees, is it?

214
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,680
What do you know about him?

215
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,160
Jason Voorhees.

216
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,840
He killed nearly
200 people

217
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,680
and simply disappeared
without a trace.

218
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,360
Under the right buyer,
he could be worth a fortune.

219
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,080
I've got him frozen
right here on the ship.

220
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,080
- You work out a list of ownership?
- No list.

221
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,760
He's my find.
He's mine.

222
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,720
- What about your students?
- They're students.

223
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,720
The educational experience
will be enough.

224
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,960
Doctor, doctor,
you are one son of a bitch.

225
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,680
Soon to be one rich
son of a bitch.

226
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,040
Lowe out.

227
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,600
Professor,
I think that...

228
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,960
We need to talk

229
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,480
about my midterm.

230
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,160
Oh, poor baby.
No wonder you wore this thing.

231
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,080
Harder.

232
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,520
Harder.

233
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,680
Who's been a naughty
little boy?

234
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,360
I have.

235
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,400
- Harder. - You want it a little harder?

236
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,920
- Yeah.
- How's that?

237
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,240
- Oh, God. That's it.
- That's it right there?!

238
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,720
- Oh, yeah.
- Daddy likes it hard?

239
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,080
<i>- Yeah!
- Daddy wants it hard?!</i>

240
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,840
<i>- Oh, yeah. That's it.
- Right there?!</i>

241
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,520
You like it right there?

242
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,440
- A little harder for daddy?! - Yeah!

243
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,400
- Come on, come on!
- You pass!

244
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,680
- What do you think?
- Hmm?

245
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,880
- Do you like them?
- They're fine.

246
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,520
Look, Kay-Em, I don't think
this is going to work.

247
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,080
Why do you want
those things, anyways?

248
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,240
- Janessa has them.
- Well, janessa's...

249
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,200
- Real?
- Yes.

250
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,080
Let's not complicate
things, all right?

251
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,240
I like you just
the way you are.

252
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,000
I think
you're perfect.

253
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,480
Okay.

254
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,920
[Muffled scream]

255
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,360
[Shrieking]
Help me!

256
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,640
Somebody help me!

257
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,400
No! No!

258
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,160
No!!

259
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,000
I brought you
something to eat.

260
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,240
Not much longer
and we'll be at earth two.

261
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,600
Earth two?
What happened to earth one?

262
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,960
It's dead.

263
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,920
The oceans, the soil--
neither will sustain life.

264
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,480
Can I do anything else
for you?

265
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,160
You want to tell me
what happened down there?

266
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,160
I take it being stabbed
and frozen

267
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,040
wasn't part of your plan.

268
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,600
I'm a...

269
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,200
I was a project leader
at crystal lake research.

270
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,640
- The subject was Jason Voorhees.
- Jason Voorhees?

271
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,920
Notorious murderer?

272
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,920
We executed him
for the first time in 2008.

273
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,240
- For the first time?
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,080
We tried everything.

275
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,560
Electrocution, gas,
firing squad,

276
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,120
we even hung him once.
Nothing worked.

277
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,880
Finally it was decided that
if we couldn't terminate him,

278
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,160
we could at least contain him--
cryogenic stasis.

279
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,240
Freeze him till we could
figure out what to do.

280
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,560
- Seems sensible.
- I thought so.

281
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,880
But unfortunately some people
who were too smart

282
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,520
for their own good,

283
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,800
felt that a creature
that couldn't be killed,

284
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,360
was simply too valuable
to just file away.

285
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,640
In the end it always
comes down to money.

286
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,240
How do you thank someone
who gives you back your life?

287
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,040
You're going to be alive
for a long time.

288
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,560
We'll figure out something.

289
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,720
Why don't you
just admit it?

290
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,400
You want me.

291
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,280
I could never be with a girl whose
balls are bigger than mine.

292
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,920
Guys, our star patient
is back.

293
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,720
Rowan, this is tsunaron
and janessa.

294
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,440
- Hi.
- Hi.

295
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,880
I see that
my clothes fit okay.

296
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,800
Oh, these are yours?
They're great. Thank you.

297
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,000
Whoa.

298
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,440
What are those?

299
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,800
These are janessa's
love children.

300
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,040
You see now, it is that wit of yours

301
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,720
that is what repels
all human females.

302
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,800
- And of course you've met sergeant Brodski.
- Yes. Hi again.

303
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,440
- Hi. - And this is the lovely Kay-Em 14,

304
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,680
tsunaron's little
love-bot.

305
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,360
Easy, janessa.

306
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,120
Kay-Em is a knowledge
matrix android

307
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,600
that I have been
programming.

308
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,520
Amazing.

309
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,160
- She looks so real.
- I am real.

310
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,360
- Where do you want this?
- Lab two, I think.

311
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,880
Whoa, whoa,
where did you get that?

312
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,200
From your friend, the big
guy with the hockey mask.

Kinsa, open the door.
Open the damn door!

627
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,440
- Why aren't you on board?
- Kinsa won't open the door.

628
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,240
I think that she's
finally lost it

629
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,640
and this is a really
bad time for this!

630
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,920
Janessa,
give me the comm.

631
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,200
Kinsa, kinsa honey,
it's rowan.

632
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,960
I need you to open
the door.

633
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,040
No.

634
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,000
Kinsa, sweetheart,
it's all over.

635
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,840
We can go home. All you need
to do is open the door for us.

636
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,160
No.

637
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,800
<i>- [Rumbling]
- Come on, guys!</i>

638
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,880
Jesus Christ, kinsa,
open the goddamn door!

639
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,880
Oh no, kinsa, the fuel
lines are still attached!

640
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,080
Kinsa!

641
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,880
Now what?

642
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,480
Now basically we die.

643
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,480
Bullshit!

644
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,280
Okay, new plan.

645
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,360
You hold him
and I'll run.

646
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,640
Hey, slappy.

647
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,560
I got a little
something for you.

648
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,240
- Oh, wow.
- I gave her an upload.

649
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,960
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to hurt you now.

650
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,600
Kay-Em!

651
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,800
That-- that didn't
go so well.

652
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,120
Gotcha!

653
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,400
Hey.

654
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,960
Giddy-up.

655
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,840
I had it under control,
but thanks.

656
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,800
My pleasure.

657
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,520
Yeah.

658
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,160
- You did it.
- Kay-Em!

659
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,880
Who's your mama?

660
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,840
All right!

661
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,040
- How you doing there, Brodski?
- I'm all right.

662
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,960
Come on, let's get you
patched up.

663
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,520
<i>What a mess.</i>

664
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,640
Lab two.

665
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,160
- Tsunaron, is he going to make it?
- Absolutely.

666
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,800
He's at 80% already.

667
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,200
<i>This guy is strong.</i>

We've got trouble.

The collision must have compromised the hull.
She's bleeding out.

Oh, no.
No, no, no.

Yes, tiamat, this is grendel.
We read you.

<i>- Can you hear us?

Our situation is critical.

<i>Eta, 45 minutes.</i>

684
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,080
We don't have
that much time.

685
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,520
Tiamat, this is grendel.
Our hull is bleeding out.

686
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,240
We're going to have a core
implosion in less than 30 minutes.

<i>Do you copy?</i>

688
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,920
<i>Tiamat:
We copy you, grendel.</i>

689
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,760
<i>Advise how you would
like us to proceed.</i>

690
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,320
We're just going to end up
taking them down with us.

691
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,680
Tiamat,

692
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,480
if you can't get here in 30
minutes, then there's no point.

693
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,920
What, are you high?!
Tiamat, this is grendel.

694
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,080
You just ignore
that last idiot, all right?!

695
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,720
You get your ass
out here, okay?

696
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,440
You come here,
and you save us!

697
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,880
Hey, why can't we just
go over here?

698
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,400
It's no good.
If the pontoon goes,

699
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,880
it'll take the bridge
with it.

700
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,360
Not if we disconnect
these walkways.

701
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,440
- You can't just disconnect them.
- We could blow it up.

702
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:51,040
- There's plenty of macrocharge in the weapons hold.
- This could work.

703
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:54,240
Tiamat, we're going
to try something here.

704
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,640
If you're game, maintain your
current course and speed,

705
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,200

when you get here.

Impossible.
It's dead.

01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:45,080
I'd say he got better.
He's been modified.

Oh, you think?

718
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:53,160
- Can you take him?
- I could try.

719

01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,520

Come on, come on!

767
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,520
Our exterior motor's
got no power.

768
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,160

- It means I'm going e.V.A.

769
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:55,080
- E.V.A., what's e.V.A.?
- It's a space walk.

770
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,640
If he can jump the lines,
we can reroute them in here.

771
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,480
Hopefully that door will open and
we can get off before it blows.

772
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,440
- Sounds like a good plan.
- This is grendel.

773
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,840
Our escape hatch is jammed,
we're going e.V.A. To patch it.

774
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,520
You'd better
get a move on.

775
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,880
- I'm in the maintenance hatch.
- We read you, sarge.

776
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,840
Opening outer doors.

777
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,920
Those hatches aren't going
to keep him out much longer.

778
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,600
We need to buy more time.

779

You're the expert
on this guy, right?

780
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,520
- What are you thinking?
- A diversion.

781
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,680
I'm at the control
panel.

782
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,800
- Rowan, are you there?
- Yes.

783
