5% of its cerebral capacity.

beings at the top of the animal chain

Now let's discuss a special case.

188
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,860
The only living being that
uses its brain better than us.

189
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,540
The dolphin.

190
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,860
It is estimated that
this incredible animal

191
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,100
uses up to 20% of its
cerebral capacity.

192
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,620
In particular, this allows it

193
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,140
to have an echolocation system

194
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,020
that is more efficient than any
sonar invented by mankind.

195

But the dolphin did not invent
the sonar, it developed it naturally.

And this is the crucial part of our

NORMAN: For primitive beings like us,
life seems to have only one single purpose,

246
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,580
gaining time.

247
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,739
And it is going through
time that seems to be also

248
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,060
the only real purpose of each
of the cells in our bodies.

249
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,100
To achieve that aim,
the mass of the cells

250
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,459
that make up earthworms and human
beings has only two solutions.

251
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,860
Be immortal... or to reproduce.

252
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,060
If its habitat is not sufficiently
favorable or nurturing...

253
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,300
The cell will choose immortality.

254
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,460
In other words, self-sufficiency
and self-management.

255
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,140
On the other hand, if the
habitat is favorable...

256
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,900
They will choose to reproduce.

257
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,780
That way, when they die, they hand down
essential information and knowledge

258
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,099
to the next cell, which hands it
down to the next cell and so on.

it's troubling to realize that the Greeks,

Well, the next stage would probably
be control of other people.

302

at least 40% of our brain's capacity.

After control of ourselves and
others would come control of matter.

What I'm saying is that your
theory is not a theory.

467
00:42:36,478 --> 00:42:40,418
I absorbed a large quantity
of synthetic C.P.H.4.

other people's bodies.
