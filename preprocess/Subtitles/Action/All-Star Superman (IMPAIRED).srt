...by man Samson.

315
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:12,641
I suspected as much, Your Highness.
Please allow me to deal with it.

316
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,245
Can you imagine?

317
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:23,613
A race of dinosaur men
who escaped extinction...

318
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:25,652
...by moving to the center of the Earth.

319
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:29,849
Come with me, and I'll show you wonders
far beyond what you've seen.

320
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:33,362
A small token of my affection.

321
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:37,531
The radioactive crown jewels
of the Ultrasphinx.

322

SUPERMAN:
Careful, Lois.

323
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:43,969
Plutonium-240 is lethal.

Not for the next 24 hours it isn't.

325

Look, guys, I'm flattered.

326
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,873
But you'd have to go a long way
to outdo Superman.

327
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:56,212
You would spurn my affections
for a dalliance with this--?

328
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:57,546
Careful.

329

If I win your heart...

330
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:03,686
...I'll make the Titans kneel before you
and give testimony to your loveliness.

331
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,820
I'll crush diamonds in my mighty fist
and make them into sparkling wine.

332
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:10,489
Wow.

Why are you flirting with them?

Maybe I'm teaching you a lesson
for impersonating Clark Kent.

337

I'm not impersonating Clark Kent,
I am Clark Kent.

I don't like you much, Samson.
Trouble always seems to follow you.

341

What do I have to do to make you
keep your hands off of my girl?

342
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:51,538
I'm a time traveler, and I happen to know
she won't be your girl for much longer.

All's fair in love and war.

Anyway, pretty soon,
you'll be too busy with your challenge...

345
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:04,886
...to even think about dating.

346
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:06,215
Forget it, Samson.

347
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:10,416
Lois and I are going to a party in Atlantis
in less than an hour.

I sincerely doubt it.

What's this, Atlas,
part of my birthday surprise?

350
00:25:19,002 --> 00:25:23,302
Since we, uh, borrowed that necklace
from the Ultrasphinx...

351
00:25:23,473 --> 00:25:25,668
...he's been hounding us
like one of the Furies.

352

Chasing us throughout time and space.

that just before your death...

...you performed the most amazing feats
of your career.

ULTRASPHINX:
Halt.

361

She exists now
in a condition of quantum uncertainty.

362

Both alive and dead.

363
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:07,210
The universe asks you
an unanswerable question.

364
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:10,978
To answer correctly is life.

365
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:15,121
Failure to answer correctly is death.

366
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:18,523
This is my judgment.

367
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:21,663
You stole that necklace.

Don't you see?

369
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:27,128
We couldn't fight the Ultrasphinx
without help, so we let it chase us here.

370
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:30,670
But we meant no harm to Lois,
I swear to living Zeus.

And I swear too.

Question:

375
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:46,511
What happens when the irresistible force
meets the immovable object?

376

They surrender.

377
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:18,286
Response acceptable.

It's okay, I've got you.
Come on, we're going dancing.

Wait a minute, what about our contest?

382
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:42,469
Answering a riddle
is hardly what I'd call a feat of strength.

383
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:46,076
I agree. How about I wrestle you for her?

384
00:27:46,249 --> 00:27:48,683
Or is the mighty Man of Steel a coward?

Even the shield on his chest is yellow.

Okay, that's enough, both of you.

Then we have a deal?

We did everything I ever wanted to do.
