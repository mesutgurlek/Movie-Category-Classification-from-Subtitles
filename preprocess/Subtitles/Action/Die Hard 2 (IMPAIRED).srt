Set it down
nice and easy, huh?

Yeah, sure,

Well, I can understand.

much myself--Hey!

That's a plastic fender up there!
Take it easy!

will you?

a cop in New York City.

because my wife took a job there.

to give you another car.

that deposed General

will be delivered

to the United States.

Only two years ago,
General Esperanza

47
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,655
led his country's army

48

in a campaign against
Communist insurgents,

00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,165
a campaign fought with
American money and advisers.

50
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,171
Esperanza's fall from power
caused ripples

51
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,241
not only in his country's
recent election,

52
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,208
but closer to home,
as well,

53
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,677
when high-ranking
Pentagon officials were charged

54
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,544
with supplying him with weapons
despite the Congressional ban.

is accused of replacing

59

earlier this year,

64
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,129
the agreement to extradite him
was only reached yesterday,

65
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,499
and Washington
insiders say

66
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,334
it was a phone call
that made it happen,

out there, man!

Yeah. Why?

Because I want you to
open it up, that's why.

00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,894
with a gun,
shooting at people.

329
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,695
What do you call
that shit?

330
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,064
Self-defense.

331
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,434
Well, what, you think
that L.A. badge

332
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,439
is going to get you

333
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,441
a free lunch or something
around here?

334
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,943
Well...maybe a little
professional courtesy.

335
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,276
Huh! In an airport
on Christmas week?

336
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,939
You've got to be
kidding.

337
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,449
O.K. Fuck courtesy.

338
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,950
How about just
being professional?

339
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,953
Your boys just walked away
from a crime scene, Captain.

340
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,955
You can't wrap this thing
up in 1 0 minutes.

341
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,456
You got to
seal the area off,

342
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,116
take pictures,
dust for prints.

343
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,354
Hey, don't
lecture me, hotshot.

344
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:31,952
I know
what I'm doing.

345
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,463
We're going
to dust it down.

346
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,465
We'll take all the pictures.
We'll sweep for fibers.

347
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,966
When are you
going to do this?

348
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,468
After 300 or 400
people go through?

349
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,969
You'd be lucky
to get a print

350
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,596
from one
of your own people.

351
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,605
Just shut down
that area and--

352
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,471
Oh,just
shut the area down.

353
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,306
It's that simple, huh?
Just shut the area down?

354
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,642
Yeah, and I got everybody

355
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,477
from the Shriners'
Convention

356
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,983
to goddamn Boy Scouts
traipsing through here!

357
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,077
I got lost kids,
lost dogs--

358
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,247
Not now! Later!

359
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,483
I got international
diplomats.

360
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,492
I got a fuckin' reindeer
flying in here

361
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,425
from the fuckin'
petting zoo!

362
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,929
ButJohn McClane,
he's got a little problem.

363
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,398
Hell, let's shut down
the whole fuckin' airport!

364
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,093
What do you think
they're going to say upstairs

365
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,431
when I tell them that?

366
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:13,970
Pick up the phone
and find out.

367
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,937
I don't need
fuckin' Forensics

368
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,440
to tell me
all this was

369
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,009
was some punk
stealing luggage!

370
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,170
Luggage? That punk
pulled a Glock 7 on me.

371
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,508
You know what that is?

372
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,445
It's a porcelain gun
made in Germany.

373
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,483
It doesn't show up
on your airport X-ray machines

374
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,450
and costs more than
you make in a month.

375
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,748
You'd be surprised
what I make in a month.

376
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,756
If it's more than $1 .98,
I'd be very surprised.

377
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,450
Hey, McClane,
don't start believing

378
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,958
your own press, huh?

379
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,824
Yeah, yeah,
I know all about you

380
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,487
and that Nakatomi thing
in L.A.,

381
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,964
but just because the TV
thinks you're hot shit,

382
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,091
that don't make it so.

383
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,261
Look, you are
in my little pond now,

384
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:49,636
and I am the big fish
that runs it.

385
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,505
So you capped
some lowlife.

386
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,600
Fine.

387
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,976
I'll send your
fuckin' captain in L.A.

388
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,480
a fuckin' commendation!

389
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,607
In the meantime,
get the hell out of my office

390
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,482
before I have you
thrown out of my goddamn airport!

391
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,431
Hey, Carmine, let me
ask you something.

392
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,059
What sets off the metal
detectors first--

393
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,798
the lead in your ass or
the shit in your brains?

394
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:22,498
Fat fuck.

395
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,985
Any I.D. on this guy?

396
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,020
That's somebody else's
problem.

397
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,721
Your car's ready.
Sign right here.

398
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,727
I need to borrow
this and this.

399
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,956
I'll bring it
right back.

400
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,965
Hey! Yo!
Hold up!

401
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,534
Yo!

402
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,471
Hold up, boys.
Hold up. Hold up.

403
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,473
We got to check
something.

404
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,475
What are you doing?

405
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,477
Pretty gruesome
fuckin'job.

406
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,479
All the confusion
in there,

407
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,879
forgot to get
this clown's prints.

408
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,913
Ew! Christ.

409
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,419
Hey, you're supposed
to do that at the morgue.

410
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,080
Not anymore.

411
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,987
Got a new S.O.P.
for DOAs from the FAA.

412
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,428
Ha ha! I don't think
this one's going to make it, boys.

413
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,998
Thanks a lot.

414
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,867
[Speaking Spanish]

415
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,534
Ahh.

416
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,975
[Ring]

417
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,037
Powell here.

418
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,375
Take that Twinkie
out of your mouth

419
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,642
and grab a pencil,
will ya?

420
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,412
Ha ha! Hey,John,
how are you doing?

421
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,112
Holly stood me up
a day,

422
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,984
and I'm here alone
in D.C.

423
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,614
with my in-laws.

424
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:28,625
Eh, the old in-laws, huh?

425
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,491
They do love their
policemen son-in-laws.

426
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,961
Listen, Al,

427
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,294
what is the fax machine
telephone number

428
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,958
there at the station?

429
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:38,433
Uh...

430
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,938
5 5 5-3 21 2.

431
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,634
3 21 2. Hold on a second,
all right?

432
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:47,143
I want to send you
something.

433
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,177
Excuse me.

434
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,646
[Al] You and faxes?
This is a first.

435
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,148
Yeah, well,
Holly told me

436
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,309
I should wake up
and smell the nineties.

437
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,511
This way?

438
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,747
No. That way.

439
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:59,153
Wait.
It's upside down.

440
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,656
It doesn't matter.

441
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,226
O.K. Here it comes.

442
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,763
I'm sending you
something right now.

443
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,162
Hold on a second,
cowboy.

444
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,937
[Beep]

445
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:23,946
Fingerprints?

446
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,381
We've got an unidentified
stiff here.

447
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:27,610
I've circled
the whirls in pen

448
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,277
in case the transmission's
a little fuzzy.

449
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,945
Listen, run it
through state and federal,

450
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,546
and if you can,
run it through Interpol.

451
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,989
Will do.
Well, what's this about?

452
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,526
Oh,just a feeling
I have.

453
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,789
Ouch. When you get
those feelings,

454
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,024
insurance companies
start to go bankrupt.

455
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,930
Listen, the, uh,
fax number is...

456
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,502
Is on the top edge
of the transmission...

457
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,367
Is on the top edge

458
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,702
of the transmission
you just got.

459
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,834
Oh, an airport, huh?

460
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:56,004
Listen, you're not pissing
in somebody's pool, are you?

461
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,308
Ha ha. Yeah.

462
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,383
And I'm fresh
out of chlorine.

463
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,889
Just as this storm
starts breaking,

464
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:10,928
the satellite will feed up
and drop the other shoe.

465
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:13,088
Look at this new front
moving in.

466
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,496
Makes its baby brother
look like chicken shit.

467
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,929
Well, I can sand down
all the runways

468
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:20,834
and keep the plows going
between landings,

469
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,839
but you got to
downshift them up there,

470
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,272
give me time to work.

471
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,502
You got it.

472
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,135
All right, everyone.

473
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,113
Let's call all our birds
and slow them down

474
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,946
before we get a parking lot
over our heads.

475
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,952
The line starts
at the Mississippi,

476
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,113
and they better start
taking numbers.

477
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,056
Can I get you another?

478
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,297
No, thank you.

479
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,100
I only have to
look at his face

480
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,571
for another 1 5
or 20 minutes.

481
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:01,078
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.

482
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,340
I've just been informed
by Dulles Traffic Control

483
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,848
that there's a weather front
moving in ahead of us.

484
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,545
We may be up here
a little while longer.

485
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:10,916
Thank you.

486
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,489
On second
thought...

487
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,828
[Ring]

488
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:20,829
Al?

489
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,832
Hey, I'm right here,
partner.

490
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,767
Your stiff's dossier is
coming through right now.

491
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,038
What can you
tell me about him?

492
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,334
He's dead.

493
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,535
You needed a computer
to figure that one out?

494
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,441
No, no. You don't
follow me.

495
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,605
According to
the Department of Defense,

496
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,740
he's been dead
for two years.

497
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,112
What?

498
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,085
That's right. Sergeant
Oswald Cochrane.

499
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,780
American adviser
in Honduras.

500
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,484
Killed in a helicopter
accident 5-1 1 -88.

501
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,117
Officer.

502
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,628
Read between the lines,
and I'd say it looks

503
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,631
like a lot of black-bag
stuff to me.

504
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,132
Yeah, I see it.

505
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,792
All right, Al.
Thanks a lot.

506
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,800
Hey, anytime.

507
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,029
O.K.

508
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,734
Say, I close
in about an hour.

509
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:06,140
Maybe we can go
get a drink?

510
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,179
Just the fax, ma'am.

511
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,771
Just the fax.

512
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,584
Hey, wait a second.
Wait. I see somebody.

513
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,952
I'll call you back.

514
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,722
The Ghost
of Christmas Past.

515
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,266
Nakatomi? L.A.? You're
John McClane, right?

516
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:31,767
Who are you?

517
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,134
Sam Coleman.
WNTW news.

518
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,638
Excuse me.

519
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,833
Give me a break.
I saw the stiff.

520
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,376
Word is that was
your handiwork.

521
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,878
No. I only do
needlepoint.

522
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,110
Great. National
just shut down.

523
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,882
Totally iced.

524
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,117
They're going to
be sending us their planes.

525
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,283
Happy, happy holiday.

526
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:56,621
The worst part,
Mr. Trudeau,

527
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:57,786
was the press.

528
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,454
Oh, they were
here anyways,

529
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:00,531
crawling all over
the Esperanza story,

530
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,463
so they got it right
on the fucking news.

531
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,966
You know,
bloodstains and all.

532
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,127
Personally, I'd like
to lock every damn reporter

533
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,137
out of the airport,
but then they'd just pull

534
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,139
that freedom-of-speech
crap on us.

535
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,106
Then the ACLU would be
all over us.

536
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,472
Murder on television.

537
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,240
Hell of a start
for Christmas weekend.

538
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,942
What is it? A gang thing
like last time?

539
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,849
Only if your gangs get
their training at Fort Bragg.

540
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,220
Who the hell
is this?

541
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,221
Uh-uh,
McClane.

542
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,757
I'm a police officer.

543
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,326
In an unauthorized area.

544
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,054
L.A., Mr. Trudeau,
don't mean shit.

545
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,824
That's what I said
about my last
cholesterol test.

546
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:37,629
So what's your problem,
Lieutenant McClane?

547
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,499
I'm sure Captain Lorenzo
has explained to you

548
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,768
the minor little fracas
with the minor little thieves.

549
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:46,503
Maybe he can explain this.

550
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,191
All systems
tapped, Colonel.

551
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:07,696
Fire it up.

552
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,647
" H" minus five minutes.

553
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:26,216
Stand by.

554
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,213
All right. We've got
a body in the morgue

555
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,754
that seems
to have died twice.

556
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,084
Assuming it's not
a computer error,

557
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,351
what do we assume?

558
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,653
That somebody's about
to seriously fuck

559
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,784
with this airport.

560
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,590
What is that
supposed to mean?

561
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,596
I mean, I know we're dummies
up here, McClane,

562
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:42,791
so give us a taste
of your genius.

563
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,300
This a hijacking?
A robbery? What?

564
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,926
Look, I'm not sure.

565
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,938
Oh, he's not sure.
Well, I'm stunned.

566
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,439
I got to lie down.

567
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:52,509
The only people that go
to this much trouble

568
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,635
are professionals--
not luggage thieves and not punks.

569
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,179
Professional at what?

570
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,509
What the fuck do you
think this is, huh,

571
00:31:57,615 --> 00:31:58,707
the safety patrol here?

572
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,807
This is the resume
of a professional mercenary.

573
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,682
You got the world's
biggest drug dealer on his way here.

574
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,687
You need a slide rule
to figure this out,

575
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,484
or maybe another
body in a zipper bag

576
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,785
before you start
asking questions?

577
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,224
You're the one that gave us
that fucking body.

578
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,226
Remember that.

579
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,762
Yeah, I remember that.

580
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:22,367
Lorenzo, have all your
shift commanders report in. Now.

581
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,033
What? You're not
buying into this?

582
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,077
I want them to report
anything out of the ordinary,

583
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,873
no matter how trivial.
You got that?

584
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,038
Yeah, I got it.

585
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,206
Oh, my God!

586
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,544
What?

587
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,049
The runways.

588
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,983
What the hell?

589
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,315
They're shutting down.

590
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,548
Jesus Christ.

591
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,661
Go to emergency
lighting now.

592
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:50,131
Emergency. We are
in a code yellow.

593
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,031
Backup systems
won't come up.

594
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,228
Shunt to another
terminal.

595
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,828
Bobby, what
do you got?

596
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,907
Nothing.
The whole network is down.

597
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,771
Maybe we should call
the power company, huh?

598
00:32:58,876 --> 00:33:00,673
We're on the same goddamn grid.
We're hot.

599
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,678
Dulles, what's going on?
I'm on approach.

600
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,111
Maintain position. Repeat.

601
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,183
What's going on down there?

602
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:07,444
Roger. We're on it.

603
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:08,780
We're unable right now.
Please delay.

604
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:12,287
Fuji 604. Execute published
missed-approach procedure

605
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,550
and hold.

606
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,126
TWA 23, unable to clear you
for approach at this time.

607
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,923
Climb to and maintain
one zero thousand.

608
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,090
I've checked all systems.
It ain't happening.

609
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,638
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

610
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,147
What's it
look like?

611
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,648
Approach control--
it's gone.

612
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,845
Jesus. Instrument
landing system is down.

613
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,389
Confirmed.
I LS is dead.

614
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,925
Every goddamn
system's dead.

615
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,495
And Inmac monitors
are down.

616
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,600
Attention all controllers.
Attention.

617
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,137
We have a code-red alert.

618
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,797

to their alternate airport now.

Everyone already on approach
or inside our pattern

622
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,615
holds at the outer markers.

623
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,619
Stack 'em, pack 'em,
and rack 'em.

624
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,745
Move.

625
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,255
Get someone on it!

[Beeping]

627
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,452
All right. Not a word
of this leaves this room.

628
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,032
There must be 1 5,000 people
in this airport,

629
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,693
and we don't need panic
on our hands.

630
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:33,828
We just bought ourselves
maybe two hours.

631
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,838
After that,
those planes low on fuel

632
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,805
aren't going to
be circling.

633
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,605
They're going to be dropping
on the White House lawn.

634
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,747
McClane, this
what you expected?

635
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,148
No.

636
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,244
This is just
the beginning.

They can't.

Maybe it's the boys
that pulled all your plugs.

Attention.

become very attentive

00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,604
I think I've got
your attention.

648
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,616
I'm aware your recorders
are active,

649
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,117
so I'll be quick.

650
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,552
You can play me back later
to your heart's content.

651
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,146
How did you get on this line?
Who is this?

652
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,624
Who I am is unimportant.

653
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,126
What I want...

654
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,958
Well, if you don't want
those planes

655
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,793
to start splashing
into the Potomac

656
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,457
as they run out
of fuel,

657
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,262
what I want is
very important.

658
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,462
Aplane will be landing
at this airport

659
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,902
in 58 minutes.

660
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:45,237
It is FM-1,
Foreign Military One.

661
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,140
Now, I'm sure you gentlemen
are well aware

662
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,177
of the unique nature...

663
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,211
Esperanza?

664
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,473
of this flight,

665
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:51,809
the importance
of its cargo.

666
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,817
This plane will not
be met by anyone.

667
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,320
It will land on a runway
of my designation,

668
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:01,721
where it will remain
isolated and unapproached.

669
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,260
That will conclude my interest
in this aircraft

670
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,125
and your responsibility
for it.

671
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,599
At the same time, I want
a 7 47 cargo conversion

672
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:14,398
fully fueled
and placed at my disposal.

673
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:18,339
You have two more minutes
to advise your inbound aircraft

674
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,875
to hold at their
outer radio marker.

675
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,775
After that,you will be
able to receive only.

676
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,711
Any attempt to restore
your systems

677
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,545
will be met
by severe penalties.

678
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:28,676
He's bluffing.

679
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,385
Damn it,
you can't do this.

680
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,457
I am doing this.

681
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,288
O.K., you guys,
listen up.

682
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,129
I need you to punch up
a code 1 5.

683
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,135
I got an idea,
and I need your help.

684
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,431
If Esperanza gets
on that plane

685
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,335
and makes it to a country
with no extradition treaties,

686
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,634
we're fucked.

687
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,800
They're talking to us
on our own system.

688
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,002
They got to be close.

689
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,738
I'll have my men tear
this airport apart.

690
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,746
Just in the nick
of time, huh?

691
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:00,043
Hey, McClane, I got
a first-class unit here,

692
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,243
S.W.A.T. team and all.

693
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,842
We don't need
any Monday-morning quarterbacks.

694
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,252
My wife's on one
of the goddamn planes

695
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:06,254
these guys
are fucking with.

696
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,585
That puts me
on the playing field.

697
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,751
If you'd have moved your fat ass
when I told you to,

698
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,623
we wouldn't be hip deep
in shit right now.

699
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,629
That's it. Security.
You're out of here.

700
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,756
Mr. Trudeau, do I
have to remind you

701
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,026
about FAA regulations

702
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,294
regarding
unauthorized personnel

703
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,494
in the control tower?

704
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,629
All we have to do is find
a way to transmit.

705
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,434
Yeah, right. Somebody want
to run down to Radio Shack

706
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,439
and get a transmitter?

707
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,509
We already have one.

708
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,339
The new terminal wing
they're building--

709
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,673
20 airlines
when it's done,

710
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,337
all with their own
reservation computers,

711
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,416
all tied in to a nice
big antenna arrangement.

712
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,416
You'd better see
Mr. McClane out.

713
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,281
You got no business
being up here.

714
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,287
I'm telling you guys.
Everything we need

715
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,856
is over
by the Annex Skywalk

716
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,515
just sitting there,
waiting to go on line.

717
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,524
The Annex Skywalk?

718
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:43,685
Goddamn it, Trudeau.

719
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:44,852
You're dealing
with pros here.

720
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:46,452
You can't fuck
with these people.

721
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:48,464
Sam Coleman.
WNTW news.

722
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,794
Mr. Trudeau, there
are a lot of rumors

723
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,867
flying around here
today.

724
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,196
No way. No way, lady.

725
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,327
Hell, no. No.

726
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,598
This is off limits,
Coleman.

727
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,196
Get them
out of here.

728
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,868
Anything you can think of,
they'll think of, too!

729
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,877
Get your fucking hands
off me.

730
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,879
For shit's sake.
Just get them both out of here.

731
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,216
Lobby Security,
come in.

732
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,216
Tomalson here.

733
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,911
This is
Captain Lorenzo here

734
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,818
with two unauthorized personnel
in the fucking tower.

735
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,186
Now, would you get your thumb
out of your ass,

736
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,486
get them
out of the elevator,

737
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,493
or you're going to find
a goddamn pink slip

738
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,324
in your Christmas
stocking.

739
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,727
1 0-4. Let's go.

740
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,425
Goddamn!

741
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,092
Anything who
can think of?

742
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,100
Can't fuck
with what guy?

743
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,500
Shit. Hang on
over there.

744
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,629
Just hang on.

745
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,174
Big drug dealer on
his way to prison,

746
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:33,504
gunfight at airport,

747
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:35,511
every controller
in the coffee shop

748
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,171
getting beeped
and hauling ass,

749
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:38,680
and you rocking
the boat.

750
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,011
Connection?
Come on, McClane.

751
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,175
Just a few words.

752
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,912
O.K.,just a few words.
Fuck off.

753
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,514
Thanks, but I already got
that from Colonel Stuart.

754
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,855
Stuart. The guy that got
canned by Congress.

755
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,052
That's who he was.

756
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,790
Huh? Who he who?
What? Hey!

757
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:56,924
Shh! It's O.K.
I've done this before.

758
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,209
Hi.

759
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,042
Where's the other one?

760
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,172
Claustrophobic,
I guess.

761
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,812
It's a VHF system,
but the planes are so close

762
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,081
it doesn't matter.

763
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,986
I can rig our frequency
in 30 minutes,

764
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,820
wire in a crossover,
and we're hot.

765
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,723
Even the planes wouldn't
know the difference.

766
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,695
Get what you need.
Borrow. Steal. Kill.

767
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,163
I want my S.W.A.T. team
to go with him as cover.

768
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,826
Whatever we can think of,
they can think of, too.

769
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:39,174
Oh, man. I can't
fucking believe this.

770
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,176
Another basement.
Another elevator.

771
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:45,738
How can the same shit happen
to the same guy twice?

772
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,696
[Singing]

773
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,370
What the fuck?

774
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:12,704
* You're sure to fall
in love with old *

775
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,209
* Cape *

776
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,869
* Cod *

777
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,538
* Old Cape Cod *

778
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:20,913
* That old Cape Cod *

779
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,885
* If you like the taste *

780
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:28,220

00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,529

00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:39,126
* You're sure to fall

00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:41,602
* Cape Cod **

785
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,442
Who are you?

786
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,306
Who are you?

787
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,937
I'm Marvin.

788
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,707
Marvin. I'm Marvin.

789
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,715
I thought
you was trying

790
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,910
to steal my records,
that's all.

791
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,317
I'm just the janitor.

792
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:05,018
This is Dulles Approach
to all aircraft

793
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,154
holding at Potomac Vortex.

794
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:10,062
We are experiencing
some technical problems here.

795
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,067
Weather conditions, which have
been deteriorating all day,

796
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:16,663
have now been complicated
by an unforeseen human factor.

797
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:20,505
This has affected all
of our electronic equipment

798
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,670
and their redundant backups,
as well.

799
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,443
As a result, our Nav
and approach systems are down,

800
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,882
and we expect to lose voice
in another minute.

801
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,385
We want you to continue

802
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,423
holding at the outer marker
as directed

803
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:35,458
and wait
for further instructions.

804
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,652
As soon as we're
back on line,

805
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,855
we'll expedite your landings
on a fuel-emergency basis.

806
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,456
Good luck.

807
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,899
God bless.

808
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:54,838
All right.
Change the boards.

[Grumbling]

810
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,247
[Telephone Ringing]

811
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,934
Hey, stand back.

812
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:25,940
The Skywalk
Annex.

813
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,533
No, Goddamn it.
The Annex Skywalk.

814
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,045
It's the last thing
I heard

815
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:31,079
before they
kicked me out.

816
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,376
Well, let me
see here, now.

817
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,281
Well, this must be it
right there.

818
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,911
See? That's
the raised platform,

819
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,115
and there's
the new terminal.

820
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,623
There's your Skywalk.

821
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,920
Goddamn bottleneck.

822
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,588
Nice place
for an ambush.

823
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:47,891
What's
the fastest way

824
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,659
you can get me
out to that spot?

825
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,669
This kind of thing wasn't
in my job description.

826
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:57,832
Don't worry, Mr. Barnes.
We'll watch your back.

827
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,807
Yeah? Who watches yours?

828
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,855
Main ventilation duct.

829
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,357
Main ventilation duct.

830
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,859
And bingo.

831
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,190
Just once,

832
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,595
I'd like a regular,
normal Christmas...

833
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:29,371
Eggnog, a fucking
Christmas tree,

834
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,373
a little turkey...

835
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:34,376
But, no, I got
to crawl around

836
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:36,969
in this
motherfucking tin can.

837
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,650
We're in the Annex Skywalk.
I can see the array.

838
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,689
I'll give you a call
for a protocol test

839
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,722
as soon as it's hot.

840
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,019
That's all for now.

841
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,526
Sergeant, we need
some more equipment.

842
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,426
I'd like to send one
of your guys back for it.

843
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,395
Right, sir.
You got it.

844
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,499
What the hell's
going on?

845
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,595
Hey! Put that
back on!

846
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:07,505
Hey, asshole,
what do I look like to you?

847
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,841
A sitting duck.

848
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,745
Take him!

849
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:15,418
Shit!

850
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:20,355
Damn it.
I hate it when I'm right.

851
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,461
Look out!
Get down!

852
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,700
Aah!

00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,955
Aah!

854
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,457
Stay down!

855
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,009
Fuck!

856
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,316
Come on.

857
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:57,039
Fucking son
of a bitch.

858
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,085
Aah!

859
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,026
Shit.

860
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,066
Ah. Oh.

861
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:28,444
I'm going to kick
your fucking ass.

862
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:03,145
Jeez.

863
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:04,771
You all right?

864
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,474
Yeah. Yeah.
But the antenna array--

865
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:08,744
I got to get to it
and set it up.

866
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,850
Get down!

867
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,371
Goddamn.

868
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,245

make Lorenzo sacrifice
his best men.

871
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,429
Make you waste
your time...

872
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,331
time we don't have.

873
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,816
I think you're closer
than 50 yards.

874
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:18,479
So's that airplane.
Practically.

875
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,920
Yeah. There's quite
a few of them out there.

876
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,924
It looks like
a regular traffic jam.

877
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:25,051
There's nothing
regular about it.

878
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,494
See? You're intrigued.

879
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,155
That's my gift,
Mrs. McClane.

880
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:30,426
I notice things--

881
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,331
things other people
wouldn't see.

882
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,269
That's how I make
people curious.

883
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,203
Don't you mean
nauseous?

884
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,832
Look. The people have
a right to know

885
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,342
everything about everybody.

886
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,777
You got
in the way of that.

887
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,713
Listen, buster, you
endangered my children,

888
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,341
and you didn't do it

889
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,352
for anything as noble
as the people.

890
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,354
The only time you even
see the people

891
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:54,219
is when you look down

892
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,918
to see what it is
you're stepping on.

893
00:49:58,951 --> 00:50:00,851
Me? Yeah, I'll live,

894
00:50:00,953 --> 00:50:03,353
but Lorenzo's
S.W.A.T. team is dead,

895
00:50:03,455 --> 00:50:05,855
and the antenna array
is gone.

896

[Beeping]

897
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:09,860
Didn't you see it?

898
00:50:09,962 --> 00:50:12,931
It's hard looking
for a new miracle.

899
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:15,364
Just hold
for a minute.

900
00:50:15,467 --> 00:50:16,695
I'll be
right back.

901
00:50:16,802 --> 00:50:17,700
Just hold
for a second.

902
00:50:17,803 --> 00:50:18,701
Something's
going on here.

903
00:50:18,804 --> 00:50:21,864
Yeah.Just hold on
for a minute.

904
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:25,876
I say again, Annex Team,
give us a sit rep.

905
00:50:25,978 --> 00:50:28,947
Annex Team, come in.
Do you copy?

906
00:50:30,516 --> 00:50:32,279
It's got some kind
of scrambler on it.

907
00:50:32,384 --> 00:50:34,352
Can you do anything
with it?

908
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:36,585
No.
This scramble mode

909
00:50:36,688 --> 00:50:38,588
must activate
on this code panel.

910
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:40,817
Even if we scan
their frequency,

911
00:50:40,926 --> 00:50:41,984
we can't listen in.

912
00:50:42,094 --> 00:50:43,925
These guys are pros.

913
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:45,053
So are you.
Break the code.

914
00:50:45,164 --> 00:50:46,188
I want to hear

915
00:50:46,298 --> 00:50:47,560
what these bastards are
saying to each other.

916
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:48,963
This is a 1 0-digit
control panel.

917
00:50:49,068 --> 00:50:50,057
Six-digit read-out.

918
00:50:50,169 --> 00:50:52,660
Hell, there could be
a million combinations.

919
00:50:52,771 --> 00:50:54,671
Next time you kill one
of these guys,

920
00:50:54,773 --> 00:50:56,707
get him to enter
the code first.

921
00:50:56,809 --> 00:50:57,935
Yeah.

922
00:50:59,078 --> 00:51:00,909
Sir, we just
monitored a call

923
00:51:01,013 --> 00:51:02,605
from their
chief engineer.

924
00:51:02,714 --> 00:51:05,274
Our people took out
their S.W.A.T. team completely.

925
00:51:05,384 --> 00:51:07,352
You were right.
They went for the antenna array.

926
00:51:07,453 --> 00:51:08,511
We're right
on schedule.

927
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,589
Losing our own team
wasn't part of the plan.

928
00:51:16,962 --> 00:51:18,827
Attention, Dulles Tower.

929
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:20,626
Attention,
Dulles Control Tower.

930
00:51:20,732 --> 00:51:23,792
Mr. Trudeau,
I know you're listening.

931
00:51:23,902 --> 00:51:25,529
Unfortunately,
you're not obeying.

932
00:51:25,637 --> 00:51:27,662
Try me face to face,
and we'll see.

933
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:29,604
You were warned not to try
to restore your systems.

934
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:31,608
You've wasted lives
and precious time

935
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,507
on a futile
and obvious target.

936
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:36,342
Now you're going
to pay the penalty.

937
00:51:36,448 --> 00:51:38,643
I've got five dead officers
down here, Colonel Stuart.

938
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,479
Isn't that penalty enough?

939
00:51:40,586 --> 00:51:41,951
McClane,
you keep out of this.

940
00:51:42,054 --> 00:51:43,282
You've been
nothing but a pain--

941
00:51:45,257 --> 00:51:49,125
Oh, McClane.
John McClane.

942
00:51:49,228 --> 00:51:54,461
The policeman hero who saved
the Nakatomi hostages.

943
00:51:54,566 --> 00:51:56,727
I read about you
in People magazine.

944
00:51:56,835 --> 00:51:58,700
You seemed out of your league
on Nightline, I thought.

945
00:51:58,804 --> 00:52:00,032
Hey, Colonel,
blow me.

946
00:52:00,139 --> 00:52:01,367
How much drug money

947
00:52:01,473 --> 00:52:04,169
is Esperanza paying you
to turn traitor?

948
00:52:04,276 --> 00:52:05,834
Cardinal Richelieu
said it best.

949
00:52:05,944 --> 00:52:08,139
Treason is merely
a matter of dates.

950
00:52:08,247 --> 00:52:10,147
This country's got to learn

951
00:52:10,249 --> 00:52:12,274
that it can't keep
cutting the legs off

952
00:52:12,384 --> 00:52:14,352
of men like
General Esperanza,

953
00:52:14,453 --> 00:52:16,444
men who have the guts
to stand up

954
00:52:16,555 --> 00:52:17,954
against
Communist aggression.

955
00:52:19,558 --> 00:52:21,355
And lesson one starts
with killing policemen?

956
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:25,362
What's lesson two--
the neutron bomb?

957
00:52:25,464 --> 00:52:27,989
No. I think we can find
something in between.

958
00:52:30,602 --> 00:52:31,933
Watch this.

959
00:52:33,505 --> 00:52:35,405
Give me
a flight number,

960
00:52:35,507 --> 00:52:37,338
one that's
low on fuel.

961
00:52:37,442 --> 00:52:39,535
Windsor 1 1 4.
Transatlantic from London.

962
00:52:39,645 --> 00:52:42,614
Fuel tank's
dry as a martini.

963
00:52:42,714 --> 00:52:45,012
Activate the I LS
landing system,

964
00:52:45,117 --> 00:52:46,812
but recalibrate
sea level

965
00:52:46,919 --> 00:52:50,480
minus 200 feet.

966
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,945
Oh,Jesus!

967
00:53:16,048 --> 00:53:18,346

This is Dulles Approach.

00:53:22,487 --> 00:53:24,216
Do you copy?

971
00:53:24,323 --> 00:53:26,814
Dulles Approach,
this is Windsor 1 1 4.

Dulles Approach.

We've been right here
all along, old buddy.

975
00:53:33,198 --> 00:53:35,689
Our systems only came back
on line just this very second.

976
00:53:35,801 --> 00:53:40,033
Windsor 1 1 4, you are cleared
for I LS approach,

runway two-niner.

Jesus Christ,

00:53:45,644 --> 00:53:46,906
he's going to crash
the fucking plane!

981
00:53:47,012 --> 00:53:48,570
Roger, Approach,
and about time.

982
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,740
I've got 230 people up here
flying on petrol fumes.

983
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:53,317
Roger, 1 1 4. Understand.

984

Calibrate Dulles

Oh,Jesus.

They'll fly
right into the concrete.

Son of a bitch!

988
00:53:59,658 --> 00:54:01,626
Why are they
listening to him?

989
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,092
It's our frequency!
Why shouldn't they?

990
00:54:03,195 --> 00:54:04,457
Dulles,
this is Windsor 1 1 4.

Barnes!

992
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:08,832
This is Dulles Tower.
We have radar contact...

993
00:54:08,934 --> 00:54:10,925
Give me your coat!

994
00:54:11,036 --> 00:54:13,004
Windsor 1 1 4, stand by...

995
00:54:13,105 --> 00:54:14,072
What are you
going to do?

996
00:54:14,172 --> 00:54:16,902
Whatever I can.

997
00:54:19,611 --> 00:54:21,806
Ladies and gentlemen,

998
00:54:21,913 --> 00:54:23,938
as you've probably noticed,
we've started our descent.

999
00:54:24,049 --> 00:54:25,880
We're sorry
for the inconvenience,

1000
00:54:25,984 --> 00:54:28,885
but we'll all be on the ground
in a few minutes. Thank you.

1001
00:54:28,987 --> 00:54:30,887
Please keep
your seat belts on.

1002
00:54:30,989 --> 00:54:32,013
Oh, not to worry.

1003
00:54:32,124 --> 00:54:33,887
We've made arrangements
for your next flight,

1004
00:54:33,992 --> 00:54:35,892
so you won't
miss it, O.K.?

1005
00:54:35,994 --> 00:54:37,393
In your seat, please.

1006
00:54:37,496 --> 00:54:39,396
Come on, in your seat.

1007
00:54:39,498 --> 00:54:40,396
Oh, hey.

1008
00:54:40,499 --> 00:54:42,899
We're just like
British Rail, love.

1009
00:54:43,001 --> 00:54:45,401
We may be late,
but we get you there.

1010
00:54:45,504 --> 00:54:46,994
Don't worry.

1011
00:55:03,021 --> 00:55:04,613

This is Dulles Tower.

We have radar contact
and show you on I LS.

You're in the glide path,

There's somebody
out there!

1019
00:55:55,474 --> 00:55:57,066
It's McClane.

Looking good, Windsor.

1033
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:28,870
Now, watch it.

1034
00:56:28,974 --> 00:56:31,875
30-knot crosswinds,
and the runway is icy.

1035

Atta boy. We've got you.

1036
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,447
We've got you.

1037
00:56:49,628 --> 00:56:50,959
Pull it up!

1038
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:53,529

Aah! We're going to die!

We've got you.

Oh,Jesus.

1046
00:58:05,604 --> 00:58:07,504
That concludes
our object lesson

1047
00:58:07,606 --> 00:58:09,005
for this evening.

1048
00:58:09,107 --> 00:58:12,406
If the 7 47 we requested
is ready on time

1049
00:58:12,511 --> 00:58:14,911
and General Esperanza's plane
arrives unmolested,

1050
00:58:15,013 --> 00:58:16,913
further lessons
can be avoided.

[Woman Crying]

1053
00:59:04,829 --> 00:59:07,389
We got no sign
of survivors down here.

1054
00:59:07,499 --> 00:59:08,989
It's a goddamn nightmare.

1055
00:59:10,602 --> 00:59:13,230
Hey, Nelson!
Come here.

1056

Barnes!

1057
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:27,015
We've got to
warn those planes

1058
00:59:27,118 --> 00:59:28,949
there's a lunatic
down here.

1059
00:59:29,054 --> 00:59:31,079
Get up to the cabin.
Get me on the air.

1060
00:59:31,189 --> 00:59:32,087
How?

1061
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:33,521
You figure it out!

1062
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:35,058
Here's the manifest.

1063
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,472
McClane, I know
how you must feel.

1064
01:00:03,021 --> 01:00:06,081
I wanted to help
those people.

1065
01:00:07,492 --> 01:00:10,723
I was pretty
goddamn useless.

1066
01:00:13,498 --> 01:00:15,898
We called
the government for help.

1067
01:00:16,001 --> 01:00:19,835
They're going to send in
a special Army unit,

1068
01:00:19,938 --> 01:00:21,929
a counterterrorist team.

1069
01:00:28,947 --> 01:00:31,848
Your wife's plane?

1070
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:33,247
Well, they're
still broadcasting

1071
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:35,717
even though
we can't answer them.

1072
01:00:37,722 --> 01:00:40,782
They're going to run out of fuel
in 90 minutes.

1073
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:53,869
Listen, Dick.

1074
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:55,701
That is your name?

1075
01:00:55,807 --> 01:00:56,899
Dick.

1076
01:00:57,008 --> 01:00:58,873
If you're going to continue
to get this close,

1077
01:00:58,977 --> 01:01:00,877
do you think
you might consider

1078
01:01:00,979 --> 01:01:02,344
switching
after-shaves?

1079
01:01:03,481 --> 01:01:05,676
Anything else?

1080
01:01:05,784 --> 01:01:08,844
Stronger mouthwash
might be nice.

1081
01:01:08,953 --> 01:01:10,045
And here's Sam Coleman

1082
01:01:10,155 --> 01:01:11,884
reporting live
from the site of the accident.

1083
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,048
Well, Colonel,

1084
01:01:13,158 --> 01:01:14,887
they've done everything
we've anticipated...

1085
01:01:14,993 --> 01:01:16,392
so far.

1086
01:01:16,494 --> 01:01:18,621
But still there has been
no official word.

1087
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:20,823
Meanwhile, despite the fact

1088
01:01:20,932 --> 01:01:23,833
only one runway has been
closed due to the tragedy,

1089
01:01:23,935 --> 01:01:26,733
several dozen airliners are
visible from where I stand,

1090
01:01:26,838 --> 01:01:28,237
endlessly
circling the field.

1091
01:01:28,339 --> 01:01:30,830
Other reports say that
there was trouble in the tower

1092
01:01:30,942 --> 01:01:32,341
before the crash

1093
01:01:32,444 --> 01:01:34,207
and that that may have even
contributed to it.

1094
01:01:34,312 --> 01:01:35,404
One thing is certain.

1095
01:01:35,513 --> 01:01:36,878
With weather conditions
worsening,

1096
01:01:36,981 --> 01:01:38,881
the problem here
and in the sky above us

1097
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:40,382

Yeah, what's up?

1102
01:01:54,065 --> 01:01:55,396
Did you pack the radio mikes
from the shoot,

1103
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,899
or did you put them
in your carry-on?

1104
01:01:57,001 --> 01:01:58,059
Are you crazy?

1105
01:01:58,169 --> 01:01:59,568
I wouldn't let those assholes
check them in.

1106
01:01:59,671 --> 01:02:00,899
I love you.

1107
01:02:01,005 --> 01:02:02,996
Give me one
of the receivers.

1108
01:02:07,011 --> 01:02:10,412
Can you tune in
to the cockpit frequency?

1109
01:02:10,515 --> 01:02:11,914
Yeah. Why?

1110
01:02:12,016 --> 01:02:14,746
I want to hear
what's going on.

1111

on our band.

1112
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:20,321
Nothing.

1113
01:02:20,425 --> 01:02:21,323
You just told me
it would work.

1114
01:02:21,426 --> 01:02:22,324
Is it working
or not working?

1115
01:02:22,427 --> 01:02:23,325
It is working,
but it's--

1116
01:02:23,428 --> 01:02:24,417
All I'm getting

1117
01:02:24,529 --> 01:02:26,929
is some kind
of airport beacon.

1118
01:02:27,031 --> 01:02:27,929
It's weird.

1119
01:02:28,032 --> 01:02:30,865
It's like the tower
isn't there.

1120
01:02:32,537 --> 01:02:34,027
Stay on it.

1121
01:02:35,273 --> 01:02:37,468
Let me know when there is
something there.

1122
01:02:37,575 --> 01:02:38,872

01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:29,392
One fucking platoon?

1130
01:03:29,494 --> 01:03:31,860
One Crisis-1 Platoon.
Who are you?

1131
01:03:31,963 --> 01:03:33,055
John McClane.

1132
01:03:33,164 --> 01:03:35,962
McClane, you showed
some balls out there, man.

1133
01:03:36,067 --> 01:03:36,965
Yeah.

1134
01:03:37,068 --> 01:03:39,468
Now show some
good sense.

1135
01:03:39,571 --> 01:03:41,163
Let the pros
handle this.

1136
01:03:41,272 --> 01:03:42,933
Yeah, well,
it looks like

1137
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:44,440
the pros are on
the wrong team tonight.

1138
01:03:44,542 --> 01:03:45,770
Isn't Colonel Stuart
one of your men?

1139
01:03:45,877 --> 01:03:47,435
No, not anymore,
he's not.

1140
01:03:47,545 --> 01:03:48,443
Now we're here

1141
01:03:48,546 --> 01:03:49,638
to take Colonel
Stuart down.

1142
01:03:49,747 --> 01:03:51,977
And we will
take him down.

1143
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:53,448
You see,
I served with him.

1144
01:03:53,551 --> 01:03:55,246
I taught him
everything he knows.

1145
01:03:55,353 --> 01:03:56,945
Well, maybe
he's learned

1146
01:03:57,055 --> 01:03:59,080
a few more things
since then.

1147
01:04:00,558 --> 01:04:01,582
Let's hustle!

1148
01:04:01,693 --> 01:04:03,388
The command post
will be set up

1149
01:04:03,494 --> 01:04:04,893
in the airport
police station.

1150
01:04:04,996 --> 01:04:06,896
I want to be
tied in to the tower

1151
01:04:06,998 --> 01:04:07,896
in 1 5 minutes.

1152
01:04:07,999 --> 01:04:09,990
All right,
let's do it!

1153
01:04:11,102 --> 01:04:12,660
Hey, Trudeau.

1154
01:04:14,172 --> 01:04:17,005
Did things just get
better or worse?

1155
01:04:21,412 --> 01:04:23,346
Lights--
big, portable lights.

1156
01:04:23,448 --> 01:04:25,507
We set up the field,
and then we--

1157
01:04:25,617 --> 01:04:26,675
We wait for those lunatics
to shoot them out.

1158
01:04:26,784 --> 01:04:28,843
And where do we get
those big, portable lights--

1159
01:04:28,953 --> 01:04:29,851
Borrow them
from Batman?

1160
01:04:29,954 --> 01:04:31,854
What about
the airphone idea?

1161
01:04:31,956 --> 01:04:32,854
There's 1 8 planes
up there.

1162
01:04:32,957 --> 01:04:34,754
Only five of them
have those phones.

1163
01:04:34,859 --> 01:04:35,757
We got through
to three of them.

1164
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:37,225
We're still trying
on the others.

1165
01:04:37,328 --> 01:04:39,057
That leaves 1 3 accidents
waiting to happen.

1166
01:04:39,163 --> 01:04:40,061
Are they still
bucking head winds?

1167
01:04:40,164 --> 01:04:41,062
I just checked
the weather.

1168
01:04:41,165 --> 01:04:42,223
Head winds are
slamming everybody

1169
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:43,231
over the outer marker.

1170
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:44,392
The planes
with enough fuel

1171
01:04:44,502 --> 01:04:46,402
have already been
shunted to Atlanta,

1172
01:04:46,504 --> 01:04:47,903
Memphis, and Nashville.

1173
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:49,735
Outer marker.

1174
01:04:49,841 --> 01:04:51,741
Damn!

1175
01:04:51,843 --> 01:04:53,401
The outer marker!

1176
01:04:53,511 --> 01:04:54,910
It's a beacon, right?

1177
01:04:55,013 --> 01:04:56,913
It sends out this
"beep beep beep"

1178
01:04:57,015 --> 01:04:58,573
so they know they're
over it, right?

1179
01:04:58,683 --> 01:04:59,911
So?

1180
01:05:00,018 --> 01:05:01,007
So who says
that radio signal

1181
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:02,051
has to just beep?

1182
01:05:02,153 --> 01:05:03,415
Right.
We switch the frequency

1183
01:05:03,521 --> 01:05:04,886
from the tower
over to the one in the beacon.

1184
01:05:04,989 --> 01:05:06,752
We pump up the wattage.

1185
01:05:06,858 --> 01:05:07,825
And we can talk
to our planes,

1186
01:05:07,926 --> 01:05:08,824
and those bastards
who did this

1187
01:05:08,927 --> 01:05:09,916
will never know!

1188
01:05:13,464 --> 01:05:14,863
Traced the signal.

1189
01:05:14,966 --> 01:05:16,433
Found it in
the luggage area.

1190
01:05:16,534 --> 01:05:17,432
They've been tapped in

1191
01:05:17,535 --> 01:05:19,196
to your tower chatter
all night.

1192
01:05:19,304 --> 01:05:21,295
Punks stealing luggage,
huh, Carmine?

1193
01:05:24,976 --> 01:05:26,375
How you doing,
Telford?

1194
01:05:26,477 --> 01:05:27,375
No good.

1195
01:05:27,478 --> 01:05:28,376
I called Lang.

1196
01:05:28,479 --> 01:05:29,878
They're rigging
a portable decoder.

1197
01:05:29,981 --> 01:05:31,141
It'll be here
in two hours.

1198
01:05:31,249 --> 01:05:32,876
My wife doesn't
have two hours.

1199
01:05:32,984 --> 01:05:35,384
I was only transferred
to Grant's team yesterday.

1200
01:05:35,486 --> 01:05:37,386
The regular guy
got appendicitis.

1201
01:05:37,488 --> 01:05:40,321
Word is, nobody's better
at this than Major Grant.

1202
01:05:40,425 --> 01:05:41,722
Attention!

1203
01:05:41,826 --> 01:05:44,386
Except maybe
Colonel Stuart.

1204
01:05:45,496 --> 01:05:46,394
I want to hear about

1205
01:05:46,497 --> 01:05:48,658
the plane
those bastards asked for.

1206
01:05:48,766 --> 01:05:49,960
Then I'll fill you in
on my orders.

1207
01:05:50,068 --> 01:05:51,899
Pilots' briefing room.
Now.

1208
01:05:52,003 --> 01:05:52,901
Keep working.

1209
01:05:53,004 --> 01:05:54,972
Albertson.
With me.

1210
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:01,736
No civilians.

1211
01:06:12,523 --> 01:06:14,286
What the fuck?

1212
01:06:14,392 --> 01:06:16,417
What is it?

1213
01:06:16,527 --> 01:06:18,358
The outer marker beeper.

1214
01:06:18,463 --> 01:06:21,626
It isn't beeping.
It's talking.

1215
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:23,860
Attention all aircraft
in Dulles landing pattern.

1216
01:06:23,968 --> 01:06:26,027
This is Chief Engineer
Leslie Barnes.

1217
01:06:26,137 --> 01:06:28,867
I have been authorized
to brief you in full.

1218
01:06:28,973 --> 01:06:33,376
At this time, this is the only
channel available to us.

1219
01:06:33,478 --> 01:06:35,878
Here is the situation.

1220
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:38,210
Approximately two hours ago...

1221
01:06:40,985 --> 01:06:42,885
Wait until you
get a load of this.

1222
01:06:42,987 --> 01:06:45,387
Do not accept any instructions
claiming to be from our tower

1223
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:48,084
unless you hear your own
flight recoder access code.

1224
01:06:48,192 --> 01:06:49,250
The terrorists
have got all...

1225
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,258
Holy shit!

1226
01:06:50,361 --> 01:06:51,259
our systems and now...

1227
01:06:51,362 --> 01:06:52,624
Get this on tape!

1228
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:54,254
have control of everything
except this channel.

1229
01:06:54,365 --> 01:06:55,798
Give us a second
here, please.

1230
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,391
This channel is secure.
Your own transmissions are not.

1231
01:06:58,503 --> 01:07:01,404
Do not, repeat,
do not attempt

1232
01:07:01,506 --> 01:07:03,269
to reply on
your own frequencies

1233
01:07:03,374 --> 01:07:04,568
to this broadcast.

1234
01:07:04,675 --> 01:07:06,734
These people have already
caused one crash

1235
01:07:06,844 --> 01:07:07,868
by impersonating our tower.

1236
01:07:07,979 --> 01:07:08,968
Jesus.

1237
01:07:20,024 --> 01:07:22,015
Repeat. The terrorists
have cut off

1238
01:07:22,126 --> 01:07:24,856
the two systems that can
allow you to land--

1239
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:26,862
field lights
for a visual landing

1240
01:07:26,964 --> 01:07:28,864
and the ILS
for an instrument.

1241
01:07:28,966 --> 01:07:31,867
A special U.S. Army unit
is already here

1242
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:33,231
and preparing to take out
the terrorists.

1243
01:07:33,337 --> 01:07:34,361
My God.

1244
01:07:34,472 --> 01:07:35,666
Don't accept
any instructions...

1245
01:07:35,773 --> 01:07:36,865
Yo, Marvin.

1246
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:38,874
Hey, you interested
in a nice coat?

1247
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:40,375
No. It never looked
good on me anyway.

1248
01:07:40,478 --> 01:07:42,036
Listen, you've
got to get me

1249
01:07:42,146 --> 01:07:43,170
up to the pilots'
briefing room.

1250
01:07:43,281 --> 01:07:46,876
I've got to hear
what they're saying.

1251
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:48,383
Which one of these maps
gets me in there?

1252
01:07:48,486 --> 01:07:49,384
Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!

1253
01:07:49,487 --> 01:07:50,385
Find the map,
Marvin.

1254
01:07:50,488 --> 01:07:51,546
I'll find it.

1255
01:07:51,656 --> 01:07:53,385
You'll mess up my whole
damn filing system here.

1256
01:07:53,491 --> 01:07:54,890
Let's see.
Pilots' Briefing Room.

1257
01:07:54,992 --> 01:07:56,721
I think that's
in the main terminal,

1258
01:07:56,828 --> 01:08:00,594
so would that be under
"P" for Pilots' Briefing Room?

1259
01:08:00,698 --> 01:08:02,063
Or maybe it would be

1260
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:04,634
under " M"
for Miscellaneous.

1261
01:08:07,738 --> 01:08:08,636
[Beep]

1262
01:08:08,739 --> 01:08:10,036
Oh, shit!

1263
01:08:10,141 --> 01:08:12,075
Request permission
to reduce sentry duty

1264
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:13,700
to 30-minute rotation.

1265
01:08:13,811 --> 01:08:15,779
My men are getting cold
and antsy. Over.

1266
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,211
This is Colonel Stuart.

1267
01:08:17,315 --> 01:08:19,806
Have the men not on watch
assemble for a briefing.

1268
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:20,815
Roger, Colonel.

1269
01:08:20,918 --> 01:08:22,078
What's the matter?

1270
01:08:22,186 --> 01:08:24,848
Oh...

1271
01:08:24,956 --> 01:08:27,356
Gentlemen...

1272
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:29,858
Tonight, the pattern ends.

1273
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:32,429
The dominoes
will fall no more,

1274
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:34,054
and the ramparts
will remain upright.

1275
01:08:34,165 --> 01:08:35,655
Sir, General
Esperanza's plane

1276
01:08:35,766 --> 01:08:37,563
just came
on the scope.

1277
01:08:44,675 --> 01:08:46,108
Attention, Dulles Tower.

1278
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:48,440
We will be
lighting up a runway.

1279
01:08:48,546 --> 01:08:52,073
Do not, repeat, do not
attempt to land any planes.

1280
01:08:52,183 --> 01:08:55,084
Remember,
we're monitoring you.

1281
01:08:57,989 --> 01:08:59,479
What do we do?

1282
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:01,683
Obey.

1283
01:09:07,832 --> 01:09:11,427
Dulles Tower
to Fox Trot Michael One.

1284
01:09:11,536 --> 01:09:13,265
Dulles Tower
to Fox Trot Michael One.

1285
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:15,100
This is Fox Trot
Michael One, Dulles.

1286
01:09:15,206 --> 01:09:16,639
We read you. Over.

1287
01:09:16,741 --> 01:09:19,107
Fox Trot Michael One,
you are to come in

1288

Esperanza's down--

1451
01:20:58,508 --> 01:21:00,976
Esperanza's down--

1452
01:21:01,078 --> 01:21:03,069
But he's hurt.

1453
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:05,080
He took a round
in his shoulder.

1454
01:21:05,182 --> 01:21:07,082
Plus I got
one more of their guys.

1455
01:21:07,184 --> 01:21:08,879
That's six
they lost altogether.

1456
01:21:08,986 --> 01:21:10,578
Maybe if we knew how many
they had to start with,

1457
01:21:10,687 --> 01:21:11,915
we could get excited,

1458
01:21:12,022 --> 01:21:13,148
but if they got 50 guys,

1459
01:21:13,257 --> 01:21:15,725
it's a little early
to break out the champagne!

1460
01:21:15,826 --> 01:21:17,259
Now, we appreciate
your effort, McClane,

1461
01:21:17,361 --> 01:21:19,761
but we don't need
a loose cannon on this deck!

1462
01:21:19,863 --> 01:21:21,023
What if they decide
to crash another plane

1463
01:21:21,131 --> 01:21:23,031
in retaliation
for your little stunt?

1464
01:21:23,133 --> 01:21:25,033
They can't do that
anymore, right, Barnes?

1465
01:21:25,135 --> 01:21:27,035
Besides, if I
grabbed Esperanza,

1466
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,399
this would
all be over by now.

1467
01:21:28,505 --> 01:21:30,029
Well, maybe they're just
a little bit more creative

1468
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:31,129
than you think!

1469
01:21:31,241 --> 01:21:33,505
Well, at least
I'm thinking, goddamn it!

1470
01:21:33,610 --> 01:21:35,043
Listen, you wise-ass,

1471
01:21:35,145 --> 01:21:36,203
we're here to jerk off
that cocksucker

1472
01:21:36,313 --> 01:21:37,337
until he tries
to take off.

1473
01:21:37,447 --> 01:21:38,345
Period!

1474
01:21:38,448 --> 01:21:40,040
Now, you're the wrong guy

1475
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:41,549
in the wrong place
at the wrong time!

1476
01:21:43,654 --> 01:21:45,451

1477
01:21:46,623 --> 01:21:47,590
Major,

Pentagon situation room,

1479
01:21:49,192 --> 01:21:50,090
Pentagon.

1480
01:21:50,193 --> 01:21:52,093
I'll take it
in here.

1481
01:21:52,195 --> 01:21:53,253
Thank you, Telford.

1482
01:21:53,363 --> 01:21:56,093
You men
come with me.

1483
01:21:57,668 --> 01:21:58,566
McClane.

1484
01:21:58,669 --> 01:21:59,567
Yeah, Barnes.

1485
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,069
You said those guys

1486
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:02,536
showed up out there
right away?

1487
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:03,731
Yeah.

1488
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,603
That means they're
on the field or close,

1489
01:22:05,709 --> 01:22:08,109
and I think
I know where.

1490
01:22:08,211 --> 01:22:10,145
Come here. Let me
show you something.

1491
01:22:11,715 --> 01:22:13,114
These are the old plans

1492
01:22:13,216 --> 01:22:15,116
when the longer
runways went in.

1493
01:22:15,218 --> 01:22:16,583
That's 1 2 years ago.

1494
01:22:16,687 --> 01:22:19,121
Looks like they've done
some modifications on site--

1495
01:22:19,222 --> 01:22:21,122
moved Tra Con phones, I LS,

1496
01:22:21,224 --> 01:22:22,623
all the underground stuff

1497
01:22:22,726 --> 01:22:24,626
so they could
handle drainage.

1498
01:22:24,728 --> 01:22:26,127
If I'm right,

1499
01:22:26,229 --> 01:22:28,629
all of it would run
right along the airport property

1500
01:22:28,732 --> 01:22:31,826
and go right past
this neighborhood.

1501
01:22:34,638 --> 01:22:36,629
We should have been
on the ground two hours ago!

1502
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:39,641
I understand,
but if you just relax...

1503
01:22:39,743 --> 01:22:41,643
It's hopeless.

1504
01:22:41,745 --> 01:22:43,645
Somebody ought to get
their ass kicked for this mess,

1505
01:22:43,747 --> 01:22:45,942
that's for sure.

1506
01:22:46,049 --> 01:22:47,277
Well, unfortunately,

1507
01:22:47,384 --> 01:22:49,648
there really isn't anyone
we can blame for the weather.

1508
01:22:49,753 --> 01:22:52,654
Oh, yeah? What about
that porker Willard Scott?

1509
01:22:52,756 --> 01:22:54,656
I should have
taken the bus.

1510
01:22:54,758 --> 01:22:57,659
At least they can pull over
for food and gas.

1511
01:22:57,761 --> 01:22:58,853
Excuse me.

1512
01:22:58,962 --> 01:23:00,827
Yes?

1513
01:23:00,931 --> 01:23:02,330
I was just wondering.

1514
01:23:02,432 --> 01:23:03,831
This flight originally

1515
01:23:03,934 --> 01:23:07,165
was supposed to be
5 1 /2 hours, right?

1516
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,168
Mm-hmm.

1517
01:23:08,271 --> 01:23:09,431
Do we have
enough fuel

1518
01:23:09,539 --> 01:23:10,665
to keep circling
like this?

1519
01:23:10,774 --> 01:23:12,002
Oh, of course.

1520
01:23:12,109 --> 01:23:15,135
They anticipate
little problems like this.

1521
01:23:32,062 --> 01:23:33,893
Barnes, we looked
at 1 2 fucking houses,

1522
01:23:33,997 --> 01:23:35,328
and we're nowhere.

1523
01:23:35,432 --> 01:23:38,230
This is
our last possibility.

1524
01:23:38,335 --> 01:23:40,394
Over here there's
an old church.

1525
01:23:40,504 --> 01:23:42,131
Let's go.

1526
01:23:46,243 --> 01:23:47,733
Wait.

1527
01:23:54,751 --> 01:23:57,242
There's the church
over there.

1528
01:24:04,795 --> 01:24:06,888
Could be a sentry.

1529
01:24:06,997 --> 01:24:08,624
And he could just be
out for a walk.

1530
01:24:08,732 --> 01:24:11,200
Then why is he going over
his own footsteps?

1531
01:24:13,804 --> 01:24:14,828
Come on.

1532
01:24:17,074 --> 01:24:18,200
All right.

1533
01:24:18,308 --> 01:24:21,038
Just stay here and get ready
to call the marines.

1534
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:22,771
I thought
they were the army.

1535

did you go?

He's with me.

1612
01:30:48,364 --> 01:30:50,264
Post sentries.
No civilians allowed.

1613
01:30:50,366 --> 01:30:53,699
Hey, where the fuck
is McClane?

1614
01:31:42,619 --> 01:31:44,086
Miller, take him!

1615
01:31:45,522 --> 01:31:48,685
I'll cover you!

1616
01:32:23,326 --> 01:32:28,320
Aah!

1617
01:32:34,404 --> 01:32:37,703
So much
for the element of chance.

1618
01:32:37,807 --> 01:32:39,274
Let's move out.

1619
01:32:46,849 --> 01:32:48,908
Ohh...

1620
01:32:56,759 --> 01:32:58,818
I had the bastard
in my sights.

1621
01:32:58,928 --> 01:33:00,919
I know I did.

1622
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,340
Oh,Jesus Christ.

1623
01:33:17,513 --> 01:33:19,777
Attention, Tower.
Attention, Dulles Tower.

1624
01:33:19,882 --> 01:33:22,783
This is Colonel Stuart.
Is our plane prepared?

1625
01:33:22,885 --> 01:33:24,785
It is.
It's in hangar 1 1 .

1626
01:33:24,887 --> 01:33:27,082
It's the most
remote building we've got.

1627
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:30,182
We're on our way.

1628
01:33:30,293 --> 01:33:32,261
Have a ground crew there
to confirm the condition

1629
01:33:32,362 --> 01:33:33,795
of the plane.

1630
01:33:33,896 --> 01:33:36,763
Do you believe the balls
on this son of a bitch?

1631
01:33:36,866 --> 01:33:39,596
Colonel, you're quite capable of
confirming it yourself.

1632
01:33:39,702 --> 01:33:41,602
Now, please, don't ask us

1633
01:33:41,704 --> 01:33:43,797
to gift-wrap potential
hostages for you.

1634
01:33:43,906 --> 01:33:45,305
Major Grant,
isn't it?

1635
01:33:45,408 --> 01:33:47,035
If you remember me,
Colonel,

1636
01:33:47,143 --> 01:33:50,670
then you remember I know
the drill as well as you do.

1637
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:52,805
Check out
your own fucking plane.

1638
01:33:52,915 --> 01:33:55,315
We move out
in five minutes.

1639
01:33:55,418 --> 01:33:56,817
Flak jackets
for everybody.

1640
01:33:56,919 --> 01:33:59,319
Body armor for
the assault team.

1641
01:33:59,422 --> 01:34:00,821
Night scopes
for the snipers.

1642
01:34:00,923 --> 01:34:02,823
We will take them
in the hangar,

1643
01:34:02,925 --> 01:34:04,825
and I will
pull that detonator

1644
01:34:04,927 --> 01:34:07,828
out of Stuart's
dead fucking hand myself.

1645
01:34:07,930 --> 01:34:11,297
Take all your men
back to the airport.

1646
01:34:11,401 --> 01:34:12,800
Seal off every exit

1647
01:34:12,902 --> 01:34:14,335
in case they try
to slip past us

1648
01:34:14,437 --> 01:34:16,337
to break out
onto the ground.

1649
01:34:16,439 --> 01:34:17,804
You got it.

1650
01:34:19,842 --> 01:34:21,639
All right,
here we go.

1651
01:34:21,744 --> 01:34:22,938
Dick, this is nuts.

1652
01:34:23,046 --> 01:34:24,274
Every station in town
has people out at the airport,

1653
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:25,779
and none of them has
heard even a whisper

1654
01:34:25,882 --> 01:34:27,281
of this shit
you're running now!

1655
01:34:27,383 --> 01:34:29,214
Well,
none of them is me.

1656
01:34:29,318 --> 01:34:30,979
You want proof,
try this.

1657
01:34:31,087 --> 01:34:34,488
Repeat. Terrorists
have murdered civilians

1658
01:34:34,590 --> 01:34:37,582
and cut off the two systems
that can allow you to land.

1659
01:34:37,694 --> 01:34:39,787
A special U.S. Army unit
is already here

1660
01:34:39,896 --> 01:34:41,158
and preparing
to take out the terrorists.

1661
01:34:41,264 --> 01:34:42,162
Jesus Christ.

1662
01:34:42,265 --> 01:34:44,290
I want you
to go live now.

1663
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,368
Get me in from the files--
a publicity shot.

1664
01:34:46,469 --> 01:34:48,494
Connie's got one.
The maps--get one from weather.

1665
01:34:48,604 --> 01:34:49,798
We're on it.
We're cutting in five minutes!

1666
01:34:49,906 --> 01:34:51,305
Tell the affiliates
if they want in,

1667
01:34:51,407 --> 01:34:52,806
they got three minutes
to shout.

1668
01:34:52,909 --> 01:34:55,241
Let's do this.

1669
01:34:55,344 --> 01:34:57,835
Network, here I come.

1670
01:35:00,983 --> 01:35:01,950
Hey, Telford,

1671
01:35:02,051 --> 01:35:03,814
what was your
chicken shit outfit doing

1672
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,444
while we
were taking Grenada?

1673
01:35:05,555 --> 01:35:07,352
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

1674
01:35:07,457 --> 01:35:09,857
Grenada-- five minutes
of fire fight,

1675
01:35:09,959 --> 01:35:12,655
five weeks of surfing.

1676
01:35:12,762 --> 01:35:14,730
I wish I was
with you guys for that.

1677
01:35:14,831 --> 01:35:16,822
Yeah. Me, too, kid.

1678
01:35:16,933 --> 01:35:18,264
Really, sir?

1679
01:35:18,367 --> 01:35:20,062
Sure.

1680
01:35:20,169 --> 01:35:22,831
Then we wouldn't
have to do this.

1681
01:35:35,985 --> 01:35:38,112
[Beeping]

1682
01:35:38,221 --> 01:35:40,781
Eagle Nest,
this is Hatchling.

1683
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:44,917
On schedule...
and in position.

1684
01:35:45,027 --> 01:35:47,291
Roger, Hatchling.
We are secure here.

1685
01:35:47,396 --> 01:35:49,296
You have
a green light.

1686
01:35:49,398 --> 01:35:53,129
I repeat, a green light.

1687
01:35:55,571 --> 01:35:57,402
[Whistling]

1688
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:02,343
Oh!

1689
01:36:03,913 --> 01:36:06,313
Jesus, Officer,
where did you come from,

1690
01:36:06,415 --> 01:36:07,814
Pearl Harbor?

1691
01:36:07,917 --> 01:36:09,407
Uh!

1692
01:36:11,954 --> 01:36:15,355
All right,
let's clear it out, please.

1693
01:36:16,459 --> 01:36:18,256
Stand by.

1694
01:36:18,361 --> 01:36:20,955
5, 4, 3...

1695
01:36:21,063 --> 01:36:24,658
This is a special bulletin
from WZDC News.

1696
01:36:24,767 --> 01:36:26,257
There was a plane crash
earlier this evening at Dulles,

1697
01:36:26,369 --> 01:36:28,337
where other aircraft
continue to circle,

1698
01:36:28,437 --> 01:36:31,338
with no explanation from
airport or FAA officials.

1699
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:34,341
And now,
with an exclusive WZDC report,

1700
01:36:34,443 --> 01:36:38,277
here's Dick Thornberg reporting
from the skies over Washington.

1701
01:36:38,381 --> 01:36:40,815
[Thornberg]
I'm one of the thousand people

1702
01:36:40,917 --> 01:36:42,942
who has been circling
our nation's capital

1703
01:36:43,052 --> 01:36:44,781
under the assumption
that whatever problem

1704
01:36:44,887 --> 01:36:47,685
was going on far below
was a normal one,

1705
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:49,781
but the truth
is far from normal.

1706
01:36:49,892 --> 01:36:52,019
The truth is terrifying.

1707
01:36:52,128 --> 01:36:55,325
Look out!
Lady, look out!

1708
01:36:55,431 --> 01:36:56,363
Look out! Look out!

1709
01:36:56,465 --> 01:36:58,729
Look out! Look out!
Get out of the way!

1710
01:36:58,835 --> 01:36:59,802
Ho!

1711
01:36:59,902 --> 01:37:00,800
Get out of the way!

1712
01:37:00,903 --> 01:37:02,996
Get out
of the way, lady!

1713
01:37:03,105 --> 01:37:04,800
Go, go, go!
Hey, hey, look out!

1714
01:37:04,907 --> 01:37:06,807
This is a recording
of a conversation

1715
01:37:06,909 --> 01:37:10,072
between Dulles Tower
and a captive aircraft overhead.

1716
01:37:12,348 --> 01:37:14,407
Get out of the way!

1717
01:37:16,152 --> 01:37:17,312
Lorenzo!

1718
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:18,751
McClane, are you out
of your fucking mind?

1719
01:37:18,855 --> 01:37:20,755
The Blue Light team--
where are they?

1720
01:37:20,857 --> 01:37:22,415
Stuart's got explosives
in the church rigged with a remote.

1721
01:37:22,525 --> 01:37:23,651
Where's Grant?

1722
01:37:23,759 --> 01:37:25,090
They're going to kill
that son of a bitch

1723
01:37:25,194 --> 01:37:26,252
and get it from them!

1724
01:37:26,362 --> 01:37:27,454
They're not
going to do that!

1725
01:37:27,563 --> 01:37:28,723
They're going to
get on the same plane with him

1726
01:37:28,831 --> 01:37:29,763
and take off
with him!

1727
01:37:29,866 --> 01:37:30,924
Get the fuck
out of here!

1728
01:37:31,033 --> 01:37:32,933
When the army
canned Stuart,

1729
01:37:33,035 --> 01:37:34,093
he loaded that unit
with his own men!

1730
01:37:34,203 --> 01:37:35,898
Are you nuts?
That fire fight--

1731
01:37:36,005 --> 01:37:37,438
Sideshow to buy
them some time.

1732
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:40,873
McClane, you are
completely around the fucking bend.

1733
01:37:40,977 --> 01:37:42,342
You're under arrest,
you motherfucker.

1734
01:37:48,818 --> 01:37:50,285
Here! These
are the bullets

1735
01:37:50,386 --> 01:37:51,717
they used
out there tonight!

1736
01:37:51,821 --> 01:37:53,880
Blanks!

1737
01:37:55,391 --> 01:37:57,882
Jesus Christ.

1738
01:38:04,901 --> 01:38:07,529
This is Chief Lorenzo.

1739
01:38:07,637 --> 01:38:08,797
I want
every officer recalled

1740
01:38:08,905 --> 01:38:10,805
and assembled in body armor
and full weaponry

1741
01:38:10,907 --> 01:38:13,068
in the motor pool
in five minutes.

1742
01:38:14,377 --> 01:38:18,074
It's time to kick ass.

1743
01:38:19,916 --> 01:38:22,282
Just like IwoJima!

1744
01:38:22,385 --> 01:38:25,582
This reporter has learned
that the terrorists

1745
01:38:25,688 --> 01:38:27,656
have virtual control
of the entire airport,

1746
01:38:27,757 --> 01:38:30,817
a fact that the authorities
have repressed.

1747
01:38:30,927 --> 01:38:32,827
The terrorists
promise more bloodshed

1748
01:38:32,929 --> 01:38:35,124
unless their demands
are met,

1749
01:38:35,231 --> 01:38:37,256
and now that
the Special Army commandos

1750
01:38:37,366 --> 01:38:38,765
have arrived at the airport,

1751
01:38:38,868 --> 01:38:40,768
the likelihood
of a full-scale, deadly battle

1752
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:43,395
is dangerously close.

1753
01:39:03,659 --> 01:39:06,787
That stupid, arrogant
son of a bitch.

1754
01:39:06,896 --> 01:39:09,694
It's all over the airport.

1755
01:39:09,799 --> 01:39:11,699
300 people have died...

1756
01:39:11,801 --> 01:39:14,201
When are we
going to land?

1757
01:39:14,303 --> 01:39:16,794
...and unfortunately
they may not be the last.

1758
01:39:16,906 --> 01:39:19,466
The horrifying fact
is that no one is safe,

1759
01:39:19,575 --> 01:39:21,736
either in the planes
above Dulles

1760
01:39:21,844 --> 01:39:24,244
or in the terminal below.

1761
01:39:24,347 --> 01:39:27,748
The threat of a new and higher
body count at the airport

1762
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:29,750
hangs over the heads
of everyone,

1763
01:39:29,852 --> 01:39:31,752
and the holiday season
of peace and love

1764
01:39:31,854 --> 01:39:34,220
has become a nightmare.

1765
01:39:40,229 --> 01:39:41,628
All right, listen up!

1766
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:44,757
All units, I want you
to converge on hangar 1 1 ,

1767
01:39:44,867 --> 01:39:46,266
all sides!

1768
01:39:46,369 --> 01:39:48,269
This car, McClane!
Get in!

1769
01:39:48,371 --> 01:39:51,135
When the City Blue
show up with their backup,

1770
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:52,764
they'll pick up
the pieces!

1771
01:39:52,875 --> 01:39:54,706
Now, move out!

1772
01:39:54,810 --> 01:39:58,746
McClane, say hi
to my brother Vito.

1773
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,406
Merry Christmas.

1774
01:40:00,516 --> 01:40:02,040
Hi.

1775
01:40:08,557 --> 01:40:09,785
Goddamn it
to hell!

1776
01:40:09,892 --> 01:40:12,520
Move that
piece of shit!

1777
01:40:12,628 --> 01:40:15,654
Will you move
that goddamn piece of shit

1778
01:40:15,765 --> 01:40:16,789
out of here?

1779
01:40:16,899 --> 01:40:18,230
Vito, get the fuck
out of the car

1780
01:40:18,334 --> 01:40:21,235
and get your ass
in gear and help me.

1781
01:40:21,337 --> 01:40:22,634
Will you get--

1782
01:40:22,738 --> 01:40:25,172
Move that car
right now!

1783
01:40:25,274 --> 01:40:26,400
Right there.
Right there. Get that.

1784
01:40:26,509 --> 01:40:28,500
Hey, Coleman!

1785
01:40:28,611 --> 01:40:32,672
Sam! Sam Coleman!

1786
01:40:32,782 --> 01:40:35,012
Hey, Coleman!

1787
01:40:35,117 --> 01:40:36,414
Hi!

1788
01:40:36,519 --> 01:40:38,953
Coleman!

1789
01:40:39,055 --> 01:40:42,752
But at least the truth
is not among the hostages

1790
01:40:42,858 --> 01:40:46,259
because I, Richard Thornberg,
just happened to be here

1791
01:40:46,362 --> 01:40:50,560
to put his life
and talent

1792
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:53,533
on the line for humanity
and country,

1793
01:40:53,636 --> 01:40:56,605
and if this should be
my final broadcast--

1794
01:40:58,874 --> 01:41:01,843
Amen to that...Dick.

1795
01:41:01,944 --> 01:41:04,777
Dick? We're live, Dick.

1796
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,939
Where are you now?

1797
01:41:07,049 --> 01:41:09,415
Dick?

1798
01:41:09,518 --> 01:41:11,349
Truck lights
approaching, sir.

1799
01:41:11,454 --> 01:41:14,787
They're here,
right on schedule.

1800
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:17,290
The hangar door,
open it.

1801
01:41:17,393 --> 01:41:18,724
Clockwork.

1802
01:41:41,851 --> 01:41:42,251
Jeez, you
give me this story,

1803
01:41:42,251 --> 01:41:43,240
Jeez, you
give me this story,

1804
01:41:43,352 --> 01:41:45,752
and I'll
have your baby.

1805
01:41:45,855 --> 01:41:48,688
Not the kind of ride
I'm looking for.

1806
01:42:00,369 --> 01:42:03,770
Colonel, if I may say so,
you are some piece of work.

1807
01:42:03,873 --> 01:42:05,272
Thank you, Major.

1808
01:42:05,374 --> 01:42:07,274
You're not
so bad yourself.

1809
01:42:07,376 --> 01:42:09,105
Congratulations
on your escape, sir.

1810
01:42:09,211 --> 01:42:10,269
Thank you, Major.

1811
01:42:10,379 --> 01:42:11,539
Maybe you
should save them

1812
01:42:11,647 --> 01:42:12,705
until we
are all safe, hmm?

1813
01:42:12,815 --> 01:42:14,383
Sir.

1814
01:42:14,383 --> 01:42:16,283
My congratulations,
gentlemen.

1815
01:42:16,385 --> 01:42:17,784
You've won a victory
for our way of life,

1816
01:42:17,887 --> 01:42:22,153
my pride, my admiration,
and a kick-ass vacation.

1817
01:42:22,258 --> 01:42:23,885
Now, get on board.

1818
01:42:52,955 --> 01:42:54,855
What's the matter,
cowboy, ride too rough?

1819
01:42:54,957 --> 01:42:56,356
I don't
like to fly.

1820
01:42:56,458 --> 01:42:57,857
Then what
are you doing here?

1821
01:42:57,960 --> 01:42:59,655
I don't like
to lose, either.

1822
01:42:59,762 --> 01:43:02,196
O.K. Whoo! Here we go!

1823
01:43:10,139 --> 01:43:12,073
I don't know
about you guys,

1824
01:43:12,174 --> 01:43:14,039
but I've seen
enough fucking snow

1825
01:43:14,143 --> 01:43:15,235
to last me
a lifetime.

1826
01:43:15,344 --> 01:43:17,369
You don't get much of that
in the tropics, Major.

1827
01:43:17,479 --> 01:43:20,175
For you, gentlemen,
we'll import it.

1828
01:43:23,219 --> 01:43:24,686
Shit!
They left the hangar!

1829
01:43:27,656 --> 01:43:29,089
Right there.

1830
01:43:29,191 --> 01:43:31,022
Right there.
Get that.

1831
01:43:31,126 --> 01:43:32,024
All right, now what?

1832
01:43:32,127 --> 01:43:33,321
Get in front of them!
Take it down!

1833
01:43:33,429 --> 01:43:35,522
Block their path
so they can't get out of there!

1834
01:43:35,631 --> 01:43:37,121
I'm not playing chicken
with a 200-ton plane!

1835
01:43:37,233 --> 01:43:38,495
I'm crazy, man,
but I ain't that crazy.

1836
01:43:38,601 --> 01:43:39,659
Forget it.

1837
01:43:39,768 --> 01:43:41,326
Dulles,
this is Northeast 1 40.

1838
01:43:41,437 --> 01:43:42,665
Request clearance
on first available runway.

1839
01:43:42,771 --> 01:43:43,863
That's Holly's plane.

1840
01:43:43,973 --> 01:43:46,373
Repeat. Request
emergency clearance.

1841
01:43:46,475 --> 01:43:47,499
I know you're
not going to answer me,

1842
01:43:47,610 --> 01:43:48,736
but you damn well
better listen!

1843
01:43:48,844 --> 01:43:50,835
We're down to fumes,
and we have to land,

1844
01:43:50,946 --> 01:43:52,174
and in five minutes
we're coming in

1845
01:43:52,281 --> 01:43:53,680
one way or another.

1846
01:43:53,782 --> 01:43:55,010
That's my wife's
plane!

1847
01:43:55,117 --> 01:43:56,414
Take it
fucking down!

1848
01:43:56,518 --> 01:43:57,951
I'm not getting
in front of that plane!

1849
01:44:02,958 --> 01:44:05,449
All right, how about
getting over top of it?

1850
01:44:05,561 --> 01:44:07,085
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain.

1851
01:44:07,196 --> 01:44:08,163
Your attention.

1852
01:44:08,264 --> 01:44:09,356
We have no choice

1853
01:44:09,465 --> 01:44:11,695
but to attempt
an emergency landing.

1854
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,200
Please fasten your seat belts
and assume crash positions

1855
01:44:14,303 --> 01:44:16,703
as instructed
by your cabin attendants.

1856
01:44:16,805 --> 01:44:19,205
Let's have
the emergency check list.

1857
01:44:19,308 --> 01:44:21,742
Attention all air traffic
in Dulles area.

1858
01:44:21,844 --> 01:44:23,243
This is Northeast 1 40.

1859
01:44:23,345 --> 01:44:24,869
We're going to attempt
an emergency landing.

1860
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:26,106
Be advised.

1861
01:44:28,984 --> 01:44:30,383
I don't want to die.

1862
01:44:30,486 --> 01:44:32,317
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

1863
01:44:32,421 --> 01:44:33,820
Just buckle
your seat belt.

1864
01:44:33,922 --> 01:44:35,822
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1865
01:44:35,924 --> 01:44:37,050
Lean forward.

1866
01:44:38,427 --> 01:44:40,554
God!

1867
01:44:40,663 --> 01:44:42,631
Oh!

1868
01:44:45,501 --> 01:44:47,435
Oh, God.

1869
01:44:47,536 --> 01:44:48,833
O God,

1870
01:44:48,937 --> 01:44:52,737
Thy rod and Thy staff
they comfort me.

1871
01:44:58,914 --> 01:45:00,506
Just hang on!

1872
01:45:00,616 --> 01:45:02,481
What are you doing?

1873
01:45:02,584 --> 01:45:03,551
You wanted a story,
didn't you?

1874
01:45:03,652 --> 01:45:04,641
Nice and easy, boys.

1875
01:45:04,753 --> 01:45:05,845
Get me in low!

1876
01:45:05,954 --> 01:45:07,478
You got it!

1877
01:45:09,391 --> 01:45:11,359
Bring me down!

1878
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:12,859
You'll get
yourself killed!

1879
01:45:12,961 --> 01:45:15,429
Come back inside!

1880
01:45:21,804 --> 01:45:23,863
Bring it in low!
Keep over the wing!

1881
01:45:31,413 --> 01:45:33,847
Lower!

1882
01:45:33,949 --> 01:45:34,847
Aah!

1883
01:45:43,459 --> 01:45:46,053
John, what the fuck
are you doing

1884
01:45:46,161 --> 01:45:49,130
out on the wing
of this plane?

1885
01:45:54,103 --> 01:45:55,365
Damn!

1886
01:46:01,143 --> 01:46:02,735
Mierda.

1887
01:46:02,845 --> 01:46:04,210
There's
something wrong.

1888
01:46:04,313 --> 01:46:07,009
The ailerons.

1889
01:46:07,116 --> 01:46:09,175
We can't
take off.

1890
01:46:12,154 --> 01:46:13,086
Hijo de puta.

1891
01:46:13,188 --> 01:46:14,951
It's McClane again.

1892
01:46:16,692 --> 01:46:17,920
Son of a bitch!

1893
01:46:19,027 --> 01:46:21,860
I'll do him.

1894
01:46:21,964 --> 01:46:23,226
This time
do it right.

1895
01:46:23,332 --> 01:46:25,232
You just get us
in the air, General.

1896
01:46:25,334 --> 01:46:26,892
You're the only man
who can do it.

1897
01:46:27,002 --> 01:46:28,799
Don't shoot.
That wing is fully fueled.

1898
01:46:54,897 --> 01:46:55,795
Ya!

1899
01:47:21,423 --> 01:47:24,119
Too bad, McClane.
I kind of liked you!

1900
01:47:28,197 --> 01:47:29,164
Whoa!

1901
01:47:31,900 --> 01:47:34,232
I got enough friends!

1902
01:47:37,005 --> 01:47:38,529
Aah!

1903
01:48:11,139 --> 01:48:12,868
O.K., McClane...

1904
01:48:12,975 --> 01:48:14,465
time for
the main event!

1905
01:48:19,481 --> 01:48:21,210
Aah!

1906
01:48:23,585 --> 01:48:24,483
Aah!

1907
01:48:24,586 --> 01:48:25,610
[Spits]

1908
01:48:50,345 --> 01:48:52,210
Motherfucker!

1909
01:49:00,022 --> 01:49:01,319
Oh!

1910
01:49:02,791 --> 01:49:03,985
Ha ha ha!

1911
01:49:04,092 --> 01:49:05,059
How's it going?

1912
01:49:08,931 --> 01:49:10,489
Bon voyage!

1913
01:49:16,939 --> 01:49:19,965
Happy landings, asshole!

1914
01:50:10,392 --> 01:50:12,792
Yippie-kai-yay,
motherfucker.

1915
01:50:25,674 --> 01:50:27,335
Yeah. All right.

1916
01:50:41,823 --> 01:50:43,051
Aah!

1917
01:50:46,695 --> 01:50:49,289
Whoa!

1918
01:50:54,870 --> 01:50:57,805
Ha ha ha!

1919
01:50:57,906 --> 01:51:00,773
Oh!

1920
01:51:04,413 --> 01:51:07,314
Holly!

1921
01:51:07,416 --> 01:51:09,816
Here's your fucking
landing light!

1922
01:51:09,918 --> 01:51:11,476
Whoo!

1923
01:51:17,659 --> 01:51:19,320
Oh, God.

1924
01:51:19,428 --> 01:51:21,453
[Praying]

1925
01:51:21,563 --> 01:51:23,030
Look!

1926
01:51:23,131 --> 01:51:24,029
Look!

1927
01:51:24,132 --> 01:51:27,329
O.K., I see it!
I see it!

1928
01:51:51,293 --> 01:51:52,783
They used
the fire to see!

1929
01:51:52,894 --> 01:51:54,225
They used
the fucking fire to see!

1930
01:51:54,329 --> 01:51:55,557
They can all do that.
Tell them.

1931
01:51:55,664 --> 01:51:57,063
They already know.

1932
01:51:57,165 --> 01:51:58,792
We had a visual
on Northeastern's landing.

1933
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:00,128
Listen.

1934
01:52:00,235 --> 01:52:02,260
We're following the fire trail
in as a guide.

1935
01:52:02,370 --> 01:52:03,598
If they can do it,
so can we!

1936
01:52:20,956 --> 01:52:22,321
Whoo!

1937
01:52:22,424 --> 01:52:23,823
If any landing
you can walk away from

1938
01:52:23,925 --> 01:52:25,256
is a good one,
that's great.

1939
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,884
Whew!

1940
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:50,850
Oh!

1941
01:52:55,157 --> 01:52:56,852
Jump!

1942
01:52:56,958 --> 01:52:58,357
Jump!

1943
01:52:58,460 --> 01:52:59,859
I got you!

1944
01:52:59,961 --> 01:53:01,019
Jump!

1945
01:53:11,873 --> 01:53:13,864
[Cheering]

1946
01:53:29,891 --> 01:53:31,483
There you go.
That's it.

1947
01:53:31,593 --> 01:53:34,118
There he is!

1948
01:53:34,296 --> 01:53:35,422
That's it!

1949
01:53:36,932 --> 01:53:40,333
Holly!

1950
01:53:43,438 --> 01:53:46,771
Holly!

1951
01:53:46,875 --> 01:53:48,934
Holly!

1952
01:53:51,446 --> 01:53:54,643

Holly!

1957
01:54:19,474 --> 01:54:22,671
Come on!
We got you!

1958
01:54:22,777 --> 01:54:26,873
Oh! Oh!

1959
01:54:26,982 --> 01:54:29,917
Oh, God.
Oh, baby.

1960
01:54:30,018 --> 01:54:32,316
I thought I was never going
to see you again.

1961
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:34,752
That's what
I thought about you.

1962
01:54:34,856 --> 01:54:37,518
I love you so much.

1963
01:54:40,195 --> 01:54:43,096
They told me there were
terrorists at the airport.

1964
01:54:43,198 --> 01:54:46,429
Yeah. I heard that, too.

1965
01:54:54,209 --> 01:54:55,836
God, that's beautiful.

1966
01:54:55,944 --> 01:54:57,844
Yeah.

1967
01:54:58,947 --> 01:55:02,747
Yup, it sure is.

1968
01:55:02,851 --> 01:55:05,786
Oh, I love you so much.

1969
01:55:07,956 --> 01:55:09,787
Oh,John.

1970
01:55:09,891 --> 01:55:12,519
Why does this
keep happening to us?

1971
01:55:17,966 --> 01:55:20,628
Let's go home.

1972
01:55:20,735 --> 01:55:22,930
Get in the truck!

1973
01:55:23,038 --> 01:55:24,869
Let's get her
out of here!

1974
01:55:24,973 --> 01:55:27,533
Somebody help me,
please!

1975
01:55:27,642 --> 01:55:29,507
Oh, honey, help me
up here, please.

1976
01:55:29,611 --> 01:55:31,101
Asshole!

1977
01:55:34,716 --> 01:55:36,809
Hey, Officer!
Hey, come on!

1978
01:55:36,918 --> 01:55:38,317
Hey, hey!

1979
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:41,321
Hop on in here!
Get your missus in!

1980
01:55:41,423 --> 01:55:43,288
What do you say, Marv?

1981
01:55:43,391 --> 01:55:47,157
I'll be damned if I'm going
to clean up this mess!

1982
01:55:47,262 --> 01:55:48,820
Ha ha ha!

Hey, McClane!

You get this
parking ticket

1986
01:55:59,441 --> 01:56:00,738
in front
of my airport?

1987
01:56:00,842 --> 01:56:03,777
Yeah.

1988
01:56:03,878 --> 01:56:07,609
Ah, what the hell.
It's Christmas!

1989

* Oh, the weather outside
is frightful *

1990
01:56:12,821 --> 01:56:13,845
Take off, Marv!

1991
01:56:13,955 --> 01:56:17,914
* But the fire
is so delightful *

1992
01:56:18,026 --> 01:56:22,019
* And since we've
no place to go *

1993
01:56:22,130 --> 01:56:26,032
* Let it snow, let it snow,

1994
01:56:26,134 --> 01:56:29,626

kiss good night *
