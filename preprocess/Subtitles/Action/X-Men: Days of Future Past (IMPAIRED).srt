she came with me...

167
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,495
and I set her on
a dangerous path.

168
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,180
A darker path.

169
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:14,932
It's going to take the two
of us, side by side...

170
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:17,668
at a time when we couldn't
be further apart.

171
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:22,340
Great.

172
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:24,842
So where do I find you?

173
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:26,677
Well, it's complicated.

174
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:31,824
Basically, your body
will go to sleep

175
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:34,077
while your mind
travels back in time.

176
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:35,262
As long as you're back there,

177
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,397
past and present will
continue to coexist.

178
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,191
But once you wake up...

179
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:44,237
whatever you've done will
take hold and become history.

180
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:47,507
And for the rest of us, it will
be the only history that we know.

181
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:50,910
It will be like the last
50 years never happened.

182
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:53,579
And this world, and this war...

183
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:57,125
the only person who will
remember it is you.

184
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,061
All right, Logan...

185
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:01,604
I need you to clear your head

186
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,356
and to stay as calm as possible.

187
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:04,941
What? What do you mean?

188
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:07,401
If your mind gets rocky, it will
be harder for me to hold you...

189
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,862
and you could start to slip
between past and future.

190
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,889
What if I need to
get a little rocky?

191
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,367
Think peaceful thoughts?

192
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:17,311
Peaceful thoughts...
Do you have any good news?

193
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:20,164
Well, you don't really age,

194
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:21,589

much look the same.

Absolutely not.

is extraordinary.

1150
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:37,843
Her genes could hold the key

1151
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:39,970
to mutation itself.

1152
01:15:39,995 --> 01:15:41,138

scrape off the pavement in Paris.

adapt to any target.

1160

my hands on her.

our sons and brothers

did we just ship
home in body bags?

Maybe fifty,
fifty-five thousand?

I rather admire them.
