1
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,250
(English commentator 1) ...what has
turned into a classic Formula 1 season.

2
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,810
(commentator speaking French)

3
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,848
(English commentator 1) With the
weather conditions so uncertain,

4
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,166
the drivers prepare for...

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,720
(commentator speaking German)

6
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,802
(English commentator 2)
...the track is still dangerously wet,

7
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,251
but following a drivers' meeting,

8
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,403
-a decision has finally been taken.
-(announcer) Three minutes to go.

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,162
Everybody off the grid now.
-(thunder rumbling)

10
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,322
(commentator speaking German)

11
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,045
(overlapping chatter)

12
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,245
(Niki) Twenty-five drivers
start every season in Formula 1,

13
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,403
and each year two of us die.

14
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,527
What kind of person
does a job like this?

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,682
Not normal men, for sure.

16
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,004
Rebels, lunatics, dreamers.

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,081
People who are desperate to make a mark

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,441
and are prepared to die trying.

19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,885
My name is Niki Lauda,

20
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,369
and racing people
know me for two things.

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,206
The first is my rivalry with him.

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,245
(speaking Italian)

23
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,284
(announcer) Photographers,
please clear the grid.

24
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,768
What about Hunt? Has he changed?

25
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,485
No, he's going on wets.

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,723
(Niki) I don't know
why it became such a big thing.

27
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,128
We were just drivers
busting each other's balls.

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,566
To me this is perfectly normal,

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,802
but other people saw it differently,

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,804
that whatever it was between us
went deeper.

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,243
(speaking Italian)

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,731
(engine revving)

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,082
The other thing I'm remembered for

34
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,926
<i>is what happened on 1st August, 1976,</i>

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,525
when I was chasing him

36
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,682
like an asshole.

37
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,489
(engines revving)

38
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,930
(tyres screeching)

39
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,802
(overlapping chatter)

40
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,645
Trauma trolley, please.

41
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,121
Hello, I think the racetrack
telephoned ahead that I was coming.

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,645
Hunt. James Hunt.

43
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,803
What's the matter? No one ever seen
a spot of blood before?

44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,811
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely fine.

45
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,849
We all thought
you'd been in an accident.

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,007
I have.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,323
If you call a friendly disagreement
with another driver an accident.

48
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,244
What did you disagree about?

49
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,890
It's none of your business.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,002
"(Q Foans)
-Sorry_

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,365
His wife.

52
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,926
That's going to need a couple
of stitches. It's a nasty cut.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,083
It was a nasty blow.
Done with a bloody crowbar.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,765
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,601
Only what she asked me to do.

56
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,365
Which was...

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,526
I'd be happy to show you, if you like.

58
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,007
-(groaning)
- Oh! Sorry.

59
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,920
(James) I have a theory
why women like racing drivers.

60
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,601
It's not because
they respect what we do,

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,490
driving round and round in circles.

62
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,131
Mostly they think that's pathetic,
and they're probably right.

63
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,442
It's our closeness to death.

64
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,966
You see, the closer you are to death,
the more alive you feel.

65
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,044
The more alive you are.
And they can see that in you.

66
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,043
They feel that in you.

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,441
My name is James Hunt.

68
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,562
My father is a stockbroker,

69
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,207
my sister is a barrister
and my brother is an accountant.

70
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,725
And I...

71
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,890
Well, I do this.

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,925
It's a wonderful way to live.

73
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,128
It's the only way to drive.

74
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,481
As if each day is your last.

75
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,561
(tyres screeching)

76
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,491
(Gemma laughing)

77
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,240
I've never been to a Grand Prix before.

78
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,163
Oh, you still haven't.

79
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,766
- This is Formula 3.
- What's that?

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,841
It's a lower division,

81
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,446
where idiots like me mess about

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,525
in the hope of being talent-spotted
to race in Formula 1.

83
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,602
- You look disappointed.
- No.

84
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,289
Ah. You only slept with me
because you thought I was famous.

85
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,930
That's not true.

86
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,602
- Don't worry. I will be one day.
-(9i99le$)

87
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,284
Morning, everyone.

88
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,924
- This is Nursie.
- Gemma.

89
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,444
Nursie, this is Bubbles Horsley,
team manager.

90
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,601
How do you do?

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,764
- Bubbles?
- Yeah.

92
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,804
- Doc Postlethwaite, our designer.
- How do you do?

93
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,805
And Alexander, Lord Hesketh,
the team's owner.

94
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,330
How do you do?

95
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,650
Fine, thanks.

96
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,569
(Hesketh laughs) Well done, Superstar.

97
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,166
- That's the car?
- Yep, that's her.

98
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,009
Lotus 59.

99
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,851
1,000cc Cosworth MAE engine.

100
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,804
She's no beauty,
but goes like the clappers.

101
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,369
(James vomiting)

102
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,408
(Hesketh) Nothing to be worried about.
Does it before every race.

103
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,562
Good sign, actually. Means he's stoked.

104
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,850
(announcer) All Formula 3 cars
to the assembly area now, please.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,002
(echoing distorted voices)

106
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,769
(announcer) ...drivers please bring them
to the scrutineering bay now.

107
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,730
All right, Superstar?

108
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,524
Never better, patron.

109
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,040
- Have a gargle with this.
- Thank you.

110
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,931
(Hesketh) Quick toke of this.

111
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,730
(announcer) At Crystal Palace today,
James Hunt's on pole,

112
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,848
with Austrian newcomer
Niki Lauda alongside him

113
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,531
and Dave Walker completing Row 1.

114
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,080
Row 2 is Mike Beuttler and Dave Morgan,

115
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,090
-with Tony Trimmer and Gerry Birrell.
- Who's that?

116
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,965
(Doc) He's new.

117
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,284
- Some German.
- Austrian.

118
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,443
He's been here since 5:00 am,
walking the track.

119
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,887
You might actually
have to concentrate today, James.

120
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,564
You'll need these.

121
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,811
-(Bubbles) Okay, start her up.
-(engine revving)

122
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,360
(Hesketh) Ah! What music!

123
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,890
They could never have imagined it,

124
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,247
those pioneers
who invented the automobile,

125
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,570
that it would possess us like this,
in our imaginations, in our dreams.

126
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,607
Nursie, men love women,

127
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,484
but even more than that,

128
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,882
men love cars.

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,163
-(spectator) Come on, James!
- James! Come on, James!

130
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,571
Go, James!

131
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,246
(camera clicking)

132
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,401
Hunt's still in the lead,

133
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,642
but Niki Lauda is right on his tail.

134
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,251
(engine roaring)

135
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,284
(race commentator) Hunt and Lauda are
proving to be in a class of their own.

136
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,924
They're leaving the pack far behind.

137
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,924
Herr Red Devil's on his tail.

138
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,042
(race commentator)
Lauda takes a look down the inside...

139
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,610
(tyres screeching)

140
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,444
...and he's sold him a dummy!

141
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,962
Lauda is through! He's in the lead!

142
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,201
Hunt will be determined
to make up for that mistake.

143
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,964
(engines roaring)

144
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,530
Hunt's in Lauda's slipstream.

145
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,608
Lauda's not leaving any gap.

146
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,725
The Lotus goes for the inside.
It's an aggressive move from Hunt.

147
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,723
Oh! There's contact!

148
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,848
(tyres screeching)

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,411
(spectators gasp)

150
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,723
The leaders have spun out!
Lauda's facing the wrong way!

151
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,687
- The back marker's gone through.
-(grunts angrily)

152
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,644
-(grunts)
- You can see why Hunt's fellow drivers

153
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,529
-call him "Hunt the Shunt".
-(engine revving)

154
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,170
(engine roars)

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,001
Asshole!

156
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,844
- Go on, James!
- The Kraut's out of it.

157
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,083
(race commentator)
Lauda is clearly furious.

158
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,607
There's every reason
to expect sharp words in the pits.

159
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,569
It's gonna be victory for Hunt.

160
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,002
It's gonna be an ignominious defeat
for Niki Lauda.

161
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,168
-(all cheering)
-(laughing)

162
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,611
(commentator) So James Hunt scores his
third major Formula 3 win of the season

163
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,920
here at Crystal Palace,

164
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,771
after a desperate battle
with Niki Lauda.

165
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,569
Lauda was unable to restart

166
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,411
after Hunt's aggressive move
caused them both to spin out

167
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,681
in the last lap of the race.

168
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,690
(Hesketh) Hard luck.
Better luck next time.

169
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,885
Hey, asshole.

170
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,122
That was my line. I had that corner.

171
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,443
Do you mean the one that you spun out of
and finished facing the other way?

172
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,881
- I think that corner had you.
-(all laughing)

173
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,486
That move was total suicide.
What if I hadn't braked?

174
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,404
- We'd have crashed.
- But we didn't, did we?

175
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,408
Thanks to your impeccable
survival instincts.

176
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,489
(clucking)

177
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,403
Fuck you. What's your name?

178
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,409
James Simon Wallis Hunt.
Remember it, my little Jerry friend.

179
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,410
(James in German accent)
Jawohl. Remember ze name.

180
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,250
And it's very simple. Hunt.
It rhymes with...

181
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,406
-(feedback on PA)
-. . .cunt.

182
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,960
A word that happens
to describe you perfectly!

183
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,005
Who was that?

184
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,242
I've no idea.
He looks like a rat, doesn't he?

185
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,446
(Gemma giggling)

186
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,005
(Niki) In my home town, Vienna,

187
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,762
my family is famous
for one thing - business.

188
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,607
My grandfather was a businessman,

189
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,525
my father, too.

190
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,449
So when they heard I wanted
to race cars for a living,

191
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,329
they had a few things to say.

192
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,170
(both speaking German)

193
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,805
Gut.

194
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,371
(Lauda's grandfather yelling in German)

195
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,482
(Niki) So if my family
wasn't going to help me,

196
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,326
I decided to risk everything
and take out a loan myself.

197
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,370
I found a Formula 1 team
with an okay car

198
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,528
and an owner who had run out of money

199
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,802
and was willing to accept my terms.

200
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,884
(presenter) And so,
ladies and gentlemen,

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,764
I'm delighted to say

202
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,367
that the winner of the Guild of Motoring
Writers Award Driver of the Year...

203
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,561
is James Hunt.

204
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,205
(all cheering)

205
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,925
Superb news!

206
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,842
-(man) Well done, James.
- Superstar!

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,445
Fantastic!

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,207
- Well done. Congratulations.
-(laughing) Thank you so much.

209
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,441
Yes!

210
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,851
Erm...

211
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,690
You know, my parents
always wanted me to be a doctor...

212
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,888
-(audience laughing)
-...or a stockbroker or something.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,684
They gave me the first-class education,

214
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,842
but, well, that all went terribly wrong

215
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,684
-and I ended up with you lot.
-(audience laughing)

216
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,250
Thank you. I need it more than you do.

217
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,362
(all laughing)

218
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,086
I mean, I have a hot head,
an inability to tolerate discipline.

219
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,565
- Yes!
- Very true.

220
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,123
I fall out with people left and right.

221
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,809
The only creatures I've ever really
loved or have treated honourably

222
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,882
-are budgerigars.
-(all laughing)

223
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,205
So in any normal area of life I'd be...
or I am, a total liability.

224
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,767
The only thing I've got going for me
is I'm quick in a car.

225
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,963
So, thank you for this
and for acknowledging that.

226
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,485
I'm going to give it to my father

227
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,324
and tell him to put it
on the mantelpiece

228
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,721
and imagine it's a first-class degree
in medicine.

229
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,404
(audience applauding)

230
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,321
(J1 Mama Weer All Crazee Now by Slade)

231
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,923
(Hesketh) Well done, Superstar.

232
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,566
Another season like that
and I'll move you up to the big time.

233
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,250
Come on, you don't think I'm ready now?

234
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,688
You are. (laughs) I'm not.
I've got to find you a car first.

235
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,161
Well, go on, then. Chop-chop.

236
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,527
Don't wait too long. You don't want him
to do what Lauda just did.

237
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,604
- Why? What did he do?
- Got himself a drive with BRM.

238
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,847
Well, how the hell did he do that?
He's a nobody.

239
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,365
He's never won a bloody thing.

240
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,363
Apparently, took out a loan
and bought his way in

241
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,090
with two million Austrian schillings.

242
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,605
Jesus.

243
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,284
(engines roaring)

244
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,761
(speaking French)

245
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,169
Niki Lauda.
Here for pre-season testing. BRM?

246
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,490
Sign the release form.
I'll let them know you're here.

247
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,765
- Mr Stanley.
- Good morning.

248
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,724
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Clay! (clears throat)

249
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,485
Let me introduce you
to our number-one driver,

250
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,562
Clay Regazzoni.

251
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,689
- How are you?
- Good.

252
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,444
- Pleasure.
-(Stanley) And these are your mechanics.

253
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,449
They're reporting exclusively to you,
as per contract.

254
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,284
Pleasure. Do you wanna see the car?

255
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,805
Sure.

256
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,251
Hello.

257
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,726
(mechanic) There she is. P160.

258
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,126
- Same as Regazzonfs?
-Identical in every detail.

259
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,570
How much does she weigh?

260
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,326
-600 kilos.
- But that's crazy.

261
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,126
- Why so heavy?
-It's a V12 engine.

262
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,329
That lump weighs 190K on its own.

263
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,323
Okay.

264
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,687
What horsepower are you getting? 490?

265
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,161
- No, no, 450.
- Well, it's not enough.

266
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,651
It needs to be 500,

267
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,404
and the engine
needs to be 20 kilo lighter.

268
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,720
(mechanic) We already tried.

269
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,961
(Niki) Tried what?
(mechanic) Everything.

270
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,650
We replaced the entire exhaust system.

271
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,008
- Barely made a difference.
- Are you using magnesium parts?

272
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,561
(blowtorch crackling)

273
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,485
Now the engine block.

274
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,291
Any mounting or fixing plates,
strip it out also.

275
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,683
When you've done that,
we have to look at the aerodynamics,

276
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,524
front and rear wing.

277
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,042
Okay, thank you. Good night.

278
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,130
(engine roaring)

279
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,445
What was Regazzoni's time?

280
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,731
1253.

281
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,924
Okay, now put him in my car,
and he'll go round two seconds faster.

282
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,049
-(laughs) Well, that's impossible.
-(mechanic 2) No chance.

283
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,011
(sighs)

284
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,367
(mechanic)
We've been working on it all night.

285
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,488
Put Regazzoni in the car.
See what happens.

286
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,403
(Regazzoni) I don't understand.
Why am I supposed to do this?

287
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,403
I don't know, Clay.
He just wants you to take it for a spin.

288
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,925
(sighs)

289
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,205
Gloves, please.

290
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,725
'Fanculo.

291
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,648
(indistinct)

292
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,170
(car engine roaring)

293
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,240
(ticking)

294
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,086
(clicks)

295
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,687
(whirring)

296
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,969
-(Nikl) I would say we push it a bit...
- All right.

297
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,042
What did you do to the car?

298
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,647
That's information I will share with you
under certain conditions only.

299
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,325
Go on.

300
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,084
A guaranteed place in the team,

301
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,807
and a paid contract on equal terms
with Regazzoni for two years.

302
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,804
(93505) Are you crazy?

303
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,447
Clay's a senior figure in Formula 1.
You're just a rookie.

304
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,962
Well, the only reason we took you on
is because you're paying us.

305
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,883
Well, as of now, if you want me to stay,
we rip up the contract.

306
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,691
- I don't pay you a cent.
- That's outrageous!

307
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,282
Was he quicker in my car?

308
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,002
He was, wasn't he?

309
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,961
Did he go two seconds faster?

310
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,045
2.3.

311
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,888
So, have a think,

312
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,761
work out your priorities
and get back to me.

313
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,171
Hey, Niki.

314
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,450
I know what you're going to say,
that it's none of my business.

315
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,561
What?

316
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,282
If it's the track manager
you're taking on your date tonight...

317
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,890
It's none of your business.

318
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,726
Okay, but if you want my advice,
I'd let this one go.

319
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,721
I'm not questioning your taste.
She is a great girl, but...

320
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,251
Agnes's last boyfriend
was a British Formula 2 driver

321
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,641
who has a reputation for two things.

322
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,405
For being a little crazy on the track,

323
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,724
and for going all night and all day
and all night again in bed.

324
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,287
He's a good driver,
but an immortal fuck, apparently.

325
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,330
I don't know about you, but
that's not an act I'd like to follow.

326
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,084
(laughing)

327
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,722
But if that doesn't bother you...

328
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,610
What's his name, the driver?

329
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,365
Hunt. James Hunt.

330
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,927
You see, you share information
and I share information.

331
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,487
That's what teammates are for.

332
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,361
(sighs)

333
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,210
(James) Where the hell are we going?

334
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,567
<i>(Hesketh) I promise
it'll be worth it. (laughs)</i>

335
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,085
Just keep them closed.

336
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,965
Wait for it.

337
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,609
- Wait for it.
-(laughs)

338
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,406
There. What do you say?

339
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,090
(James) She's Formula 1.

340
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,204
Yes, she is, Superstar.

341
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,450
Your brother and I got together
with the bean counters.

342
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,931
And since the economics of F1

343
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,561
are not so significantly different
to the economics of Formula 2,

344
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,041
well, we thought if we were
going to be losing money,

345
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,209
we might as well be doing it on
the big roulette table in Formula 1.

346
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,602
You fat, little, inbred beauty.
Come here.

347
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,565
(all laughing)

348
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,242
Actually, credit where it's due,
we got the idea from Niki.

349
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,443
(James) Who?
(Hesketh) Lauda.

350
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,285
Bought his way in, rather than
mess about in the lower divisions.

351
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,930
I thought, "Bloody hell, he's right."

352
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,562
No sponsorship, Superstar.
I hope you approve.

353
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,645
No vulgar logos
for cigarettes or condoms.

354
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,248
Just plain white with the flags. Ooh!

355
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,650
And racing overalls which read,

356
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,366
-"Sex. Breakfast of champions."
-(reads along)

357
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,771
(all laughing)

358
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,929
So, when do we start?

359
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,087
- Soon as you're ready.
- Ready?

360
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,971
I've been waiting for this
my whole life.

361
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,928
- Hi, welcome to Watkins Glen.
- Hello!

362
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,764
(Stirling Moss) When the season started,
people wondered

363
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,890
whether Lord Hesketh and his team
of upper-class enthusiasts

364
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,643
were bringing glamour
to the racing community, or just comedy.

365
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,802
Certainly, it was the first time
anyone had seen

366
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,441
a butler serving oysters and caviar
in the pits.

367
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,285
But they have made quite an impact.

368
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,523
Sixth in France, fourth in Britain
and third in Holland.

369
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,207
(announcer 1) All drivers on the track,
caution flags are out.

370
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,362
- A severe crash at the Esses.
-(siren wailing)

371
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,489
(announcer 2) Red flag.
There is a car off the track.

372
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,244
(Moss) And reports are reaching me

373
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,527
that there has been
a serious accident in qualifying.

374
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,406
Er, the identity of the driver we don't
currently have at the moment,

375
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,687
but, as you can tell
from all the activity

376
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,404
going on behind me towards the track,

377
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,881
it is clearly a grave incident indeed.

378
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,371
We will, of course,
have more information for you

379
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,487
as and when we get it,

380
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,605
but it is the sight and sound
of Formula 1 nobody likes to see.

381
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,364
- Get your hands off me.
- Hey, come on.

382
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,885
(commentator on TV)
Drivers of top stature

383
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,689
we've lost just in the past four seasons

384
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,607
have included Piers Courage,
Jochen Rindt,

385
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,968
Jo Siffert, Roger Williamson

386
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,247
and today, at Watkins Glen,

387
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,641
Formula 1 has claimed another driver.

388
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,527
(announcer) The Tyrrell team
have withdrawn from the race.

389
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,291
Their places on the grid
will be left empty.

390
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,806
- Terrible.
- They should cancel the race.

391
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,565
Why?

392
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,326
He made a mistake,
went into the corner too fast.

393
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,851
It's his fault.

394
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,809
- Is that right?
-It's obvious.

395
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,929
Look at the tyre marks.

396
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,563
So says the nobody
who had to pay for his own drive.

397
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,051
How's that working out for you,
by the way?

398
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,330
Fine. How is it at the back?

399
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,322
Not planning on being there for long.

400
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,611
(announcer)
Ten minutes to the warm-up lap.

401
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,245
Ten minutes.

402
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,651
(in German)

403
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,005
Arsehole.

404
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,688
(James) Heading into
the Grand Hotel hairpin, second gear.

405
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,761
Turn in hard,

406
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,491
looking for late apex,
gentle with the bar.

407
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,369
Heading into Portier, second gear,
clip the apex,

408
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,041
light brake, stay in second,
looking for a good exit.

409
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,448
Heading through the tunnel,
gradual right,

410
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,490
up through third, fourth, fifth...

411
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,562
(Suzy) ls Alexander round?

412
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,686
(James) Er, yes, he was.

413
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,364
He went back to the house
to take a call.

414
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,204
He'll be back shortly.

415
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,442
He only wanted to show me
his pride and joy.

416
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,131
Rhymes with "boy", if you ask me.

417
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,009
And "toy".

418
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,290
God, it's so flimsy
for something that costs so much.

419
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,365
There's no comfort,
no protection, nothing.

420
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,091
No, it's just a little coffin, really.

421
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,209
Surrounded by high-octane fuel in here.

422
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,204
Being driven round 170 miles per hour.

423
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,443
To all intents and purposes,
this thing's a bomb on wheels.

424
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,523
You're James, aren't you?

425
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,250
Yes.

426
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,929
You fit the description.

427
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,731
Is that right?

428
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,928
Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

429
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,169
Yeah, yeah. I know exactly.

430
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,330
(James) What was the description?

431
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,925
(Suzy) Mostly positive,
in terms of appearance.

432
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,207
Negative only in terms of character.

433
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,643
I've been told to avoid you.

434
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,451
BY Whom?

435
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,724
Alexander. He says you're a bad boy.

436
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,087
Alexander doesn't know
what he's talking about.

437
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,527
I was. I'm not any more.

438
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,127
The new me is very professional.
Early to bed, early to rise.

439
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,770
- All very dull.
- Hmm.

440
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,205
But according to the team,

441
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,726
(in German accent) "The best way to
keep beating the goose-stepper."

442
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,285
Is that what you were doing
when I came in?

443
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,330
Yes, visualisation techniques,
memorising the circuit,

444
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,085
in this case Monaco, which is up next.

445
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,043
Personally, I've always been a great
believer in getting there on the day,

446
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,600
putting my foot down
and playing chicken with everyone else.

447
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,886
ﬂaughs)

448
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,365
But they don't want me
doing that any more.

449
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,525
They want my body like a temple
and my mind like a monk.

450
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,329
And what about your soul, your heart?

451
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,562
Well, they've got ideas about that, too.

452
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,166
They want me to stop messing around,
settle down,

453
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,481
get married
with the next nice girl I meet.

454
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,971
They think it would be good for me.

455
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,442
Hmm. What do you think?

456
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,122
- It sounds fucking awful.
-(laughing)

457
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,607
But since they're right
about most things,

458
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,531
-they're probably right about that, too.
- Hmm.

459
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,001
You don't fancy getting married, do you?

460
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,681
ﬂaughs)

461
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,528
-(church bells tolling)
-(applause)

462
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,845
(all cheering)

463
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,609
(cameras clicking)

464
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,925
(photographer) Suzy.

465
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,051
(man) Bravo!

466
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,323
Hey, hey, hey!

467
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,803
- What's going on with him?
- Nothing. Nothing.

468
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,571
Didn't want to ruin your day.

469
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,561
It's. .. It's the Kraut.

470
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,410
What about him?

471
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,123
He's just been signed by Ferrari.

472
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,921
You're kidding me?
Jesus. How did that happen?

473
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,690
Did he buy his way in there, too?

474
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:45,364
Well, the old man took Regazzoni back
and he insisted on it, apparently.

475
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,408
He says that Niki's a genius
setting up the cars.

476
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,484
It's terrible. Drives like a pig.

477
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,687
- Oh, you can't say that.
- Why not?

478
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,088
- It's a Ferrari!
-It's a shitbox.

479
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,928
It understeers like crazy and
the weight distribution is a disaster.

480
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,049
It's amazing, all these facilities
and you make a piece of crap like this.

481
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,805
Uh!

482
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,882

"Ferrari family."
"Our good friend Clay Regazzoni."

485
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,242
You are family and friend
to the commendatore as long as you win.

486
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,731
The minute you don't, ciao, ciao.

487
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,170
I totally understand. It's business.
I would do the same.

488
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,204
(Regazzoni) But it isn't
just business, is it? What we do.

489
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,362
It's passion, love.

490
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,205
Which is why we are prepared
to risk our lives for it.

491
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,327
Not me.

492
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,085
If I had more talent and could earn
better money with something else,

493
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,884
I would.

494
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,567
How do you know you will
make money here? You haven't yet.

495
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,961
Not yet, but I will.

496

If you can, I can.

497
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,243

- Why am I an asshole?
- Well...

500
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,165
You know, by now
I'm both quicker than you

501
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,083
and better at setting up the car.

502
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,924
You can't deal with it,
so you're the asshole.

503
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,161
Screw you.

504
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,289
I brought you along today because
you seem like a lonely kind of guy.

505
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,249
I thought if I introduced you
to some nice people,

506
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,129
that could rub off on you.

507
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,851
Forget it. Make your own friends.

508
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,605
Come on, Clay. I'm sorry.

Are you leaving?

Yes.

516
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,210
Can you give me a lift
to the nearest town,

517
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,765
anywhere with a train station?

518
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,643
Sure. Trento's half an hour's drive.

519
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,327
Get in.

What are you doing?

526
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,485
You hear that noise when you accelerate?

527
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,247
- No.
- Your fan belt is loose.

528
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,044
My What?

529
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,521
And when you brake,
your foot goes all the way down,

530
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,045
which means there's air in the system.

531
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,931
- Anything else?
- No.

532
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,685
Apart from
the rear brakes are worn out,

533
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,411
the front right tyre's a bit soft,

why you're weaving so much.

Hmm. How can you tell?

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,088
- My ass.
- Sorry?

537
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,129
God gave me an okay mind,

538

- Not a good one.

Yes, a very good one, very expensive.

542

It's my honour, Niki, please.

- Thank you.
- My car is your car.

On one condition, though.
It's a piece of shit. It's dog shit.

you make my life, Niki, eh?

- Niki Lauda!
- Niki Lauda, Niki Lauda!

567
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,041
Will someone please tell me
what's going on?

568
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,565
Who are you? Should I know you?

(man 1) What, you don't know?

570
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,645
He's Niki Lauda, Formula 1 driver,
and he just signed with Ferrari.

571
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,210
- Him?
-(man 1) Yes.

572
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,527
- Impossible.
-(man 1) Why?

573
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,168
Well, you know, Formula 1 drivers,
they have long hair, are sexy,

574
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,645
their shirts are open to here.

575
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,404
- Thank you.
- Yes.

576
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,882
Anyway, look at the way he's driving,
like an old man.

577
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,571
(Niki) There's no need to drive fast.

578
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,922
It just increases
the percentage of risk.

We're not in a hurry.
I'm not being paid.

Right now,
with zero incentive or reward,

581
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,684
why would I drive fast?

582

between Niki Lauda in the red Ferrari

598

00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,725
Goes wide at the exit.

600
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,410
Hunt is past again.

601
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,523
Once more
Lauda tries to sneak up the inside.

602

They're absolutely side by side,
wheel to wheel.

So evenly matched. Fantastic battle
between these two great drivers.

Hunt is now ahead once more.

Lauda once more sneaks up the inside.

606
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,760
And again he runs wide.
Again the Hesketh...

- Just... Just one second.

Hunt pulls across to the left.

614

00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,410
You might win one race, maybe two,
because you're aggressive.

635
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,723
But in the long run, over the course
of a season, no chance.

636
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,887
Right. Why's that?

637
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,891
Because to be a champion,
it takes more than just being quick.

638
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,724
- It's the whole picture.
- Oh.

639
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,723
- You're just a charger and a party guy.
-(laughs)

640
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,080
That's why everybody likes you.

641
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,682
Try saying that
and tell me you're not jealous.

642
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,921
ﬂaughs)

643
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,725
Why would I be jealous? Think about it.

644
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,162
All that affection, all those smiles

645
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,049
-is a sign of disrespect.
- Oh.

646
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,526
They don't fear you.
Whereas compare that to me.

647
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,251
Yes, compared to you, whom no one likes.

648
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,930
- Right.
- Not even his own teammates.

649
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,765
Right. Because I'm a serious guy.

650
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,281
I go to bed early,
I look after myself, look after my car.

651
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,449
- Yes, you're very well-behaved.
- Go to work, kick ass.

652
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,291
And then, after the race,
I go home instead of going to bars

653
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,529
and talk all this bullshit
with all these assholes.

654
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,443
Arseholes?

655
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,966
You should go home more often, too.

656
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,282
I heard you got married.

657
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,884
Yes, I did.

658
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,046
So where is she, this mysterious wife?

659
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,242
- In New York, working.
- Oh.

660
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,608
You know,
I've never seen you with her once.

661
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,880
No?

662
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,130
Well, maybe that's because
you're always at home,

663
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,125
on your own, looking after yourself,
being a good little boy.

664
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,651
Take a drink on me, James.

665
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,166
Thank you, Niki. I mightjust have two.

666
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,010
(James) Right, Bubbles,

667
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,169
whatever it takes to beat
that prick next year, just say it.

668
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,691
Your word is my command.

669
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,282
There are no lengths
to which I will not go. I mean it.

670
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,683
What the hell's going on?

671
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,446
Where is everybody? What's the matter?

672
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,530
(door opening)

673
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,520
Do you know what the date is today?

674
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,046
Yes, it's November, the 14th. Why?

675
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,724
Do you have any idea
of the significance of that date?

676
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,203
I don't know.
Time to start killing pheasants?

677
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,285
Actually, it's the deadline
for securing sponsorship

678
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,283
for the forthcoming Formula 1 season.

679
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,965
Yes?

680
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,130
Which elapsed at midnight last night,
and we didn't attract any.

681
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:06,081
Well, so? (stammers)
We aren't looking for sponsorship.

682
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,447
Like you said, condoms and cigarettes,
vulgar, right?

683
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,330
(sighs)

684
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,606
Right.

685
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,527
Except we are, or were.

686
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,766
I've made something of a miscalculation.

687
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,202
The economics, Formula 1,
realities thereof.

688
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,763
It turns out,
not like the lower divisions at all.

689
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,009
What are you saying?

690
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,400
I'm saying it's over, Superstar.

691
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,767
The banks have stepped in,
started laying everyone off.

692
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,961
Probably have to sell this place.

693
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,562
Oh, Christ.

694
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,804
(James sighs)

695
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,930
(J1 Many Rivers to Cross by Jimmy Cliff)

696
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,689
(coughs)

697
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,966
I need a drive, Pete.
I need you to find me a drive.

698
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,925
I mean, (stammers) what about Lotus?

699
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,485
You don't wanna know. (sighs)

700
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,451
- Actually, I do.
- Okay. Uh...

701
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,802
They felt your reputation preceded you.

702
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,804
And what does that mean?

703
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,370
(telephone rings)

704
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,489
It's my other line.
Look, I'll get back to you.

705
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,481
(sighs) Peter Hunt.

706
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,410
Fuck.

707
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,685
Don't worry. Something will turn up.

708
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,528
Doubt that will help in the meantime.

709
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,131
Why don't we go away at the weekend?

710
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,329
Skiing. Before I go back to New York.

711
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,690
ﬂaughs)

712
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,362
Talk to me, James.
Don't make a stranger of me.

713
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,485
You know, Suzy,
only a stranger would invite me skiing

714
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,966
when they know
I haven't got a fucking drive.

715
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,124
I can't watch this.

716
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,201
What were you hoping for anyway?

717
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,967
A well-adjusted knight
in shining armour?

718
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,963
No danger of that.

719
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,327
- Let me give you some advice.
- I'm all ears.

720
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,165
Don't go to men who are willing
to kill themselves driving in circles

721
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,891
-looking for normality.
- I never expected normality.

722
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,082
God knows I walked into this
with my eyes open.

723
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,650
I just hoped I'd married someone

724
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,803
who was half as impressive
on the inside as he is on the outside.

725
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,684
At least there's something
behind the facade.

726
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,927
- Oh, James.
- Fuck off to New York, dear.

727
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,401
There must be a moisturiser
or an eye shadow somewhere

728
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,244
that needs your vapid mush to flog it.

729
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,725
(door closes)

730
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,009
(telephone ringing)

731
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,445
(clears throat)

732
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,405
- Hello?
-(Peter) Hi, James.

733
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,762
It's Peter. Something's up at McLaren.

734
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,362
- What have you heard?
- Nothing. Why?

735
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,966
I heard Emerson's off.
He's dumped them in it.

736
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,722
Jesus. Get me in there, Pete.

737
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,201
Say anything, just get me in that room.

738
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,884
(Mayer) I'll come straight to the point.

739
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,407
- Our esteemed lead driver...
- Fitti-fucking-paldi.

740
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,721
...has ditched us for another team
at the last minute.

741
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,121
(Caldwell) Coper-fucking-sucar.
(Mayer) And we need a replacement.

742
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,650
ASA-fucking-P.

743
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,486
(sighs) Fortunately, a few hands
have already gone up, good people.

744
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,005
- Jacky lckx.
- I'm quicker than Jacky.

745
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,331
- But he's consistent, dependable.
- A grown-up.

746
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,847
Right, and will he go for that gap
when no one else will?

747
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,928
Will he put his life on the line
the day that it really matters?

748
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,685
(Hogan) The sponsors like him.

749
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,322
(laughs) What do you want,
a driver or a brush salesman?

750
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,084
- We wanna be successful.
-(James) Yes, so do I.

751
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,524
But that means beating Niki Lauda,
not being a show pony for sponsors.

752
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,125
(Mayer)
I heard about this thing with Niki.

753
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,366
Everyone has.

754
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,007
- You really think you can beat him?
- I'd beat him in a McLaren.

755
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,368
It's the only car out there
as quick as the Ferrari.

756
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,682
Which is why I'm here, begging.

757
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,605
Look, I'll do whatever you ask.

758
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,523
I'll put on a tie,
I'll smile for sponsors,

759
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,529
say the right things.

760
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,161
I can beat this guy, trust me.

761
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,889
Just give me the drive.

762
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,489
(Bubbles) Yeah.
Yeah, he can be a loose cannon.

763
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,284
And, yeah, he will drive you all mad,

764
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,887
but in terms of raw talent
and right stuff,

765
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,889
there is no better driver in the world.

766
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,442
He's the real thing, Teddy.

767
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,040
- He's what we all came into this for.
- Mmm.

768
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,162
Nine days out of ten
you'll be pulling your hair out,

769
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,363
but on that tenth day,
James will be unbeatable.

770
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,402
And that is the day you will wish
you had him in your car.

771
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,524
You will never win the championship
with Jacky Ickx.

772
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,247
You just might with James.

773
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,971
(announcer speaking Portuguese)

774
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,171
(Latin music playing)

775
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,767
(Moss) Welcome to Séo Paulo, Brazil,
and the lnterlagos circuit

776
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,521
for the first race
in the 1976 Formula 1 season,

777
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,923
where the main news is that James Hunt
has qualified fastest,

778
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,082
beating Niki Lauda's Ferrari
to pole position

779
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,931
by just two hundredths of a second.

780
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,524
(sighs) New car.

781
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,010
- Inoficed.
- Pole position.

782
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,371
I noticed that, too.

783
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,886
Level playing field now,
my ratty little friend.

784
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,527
Yeah. Let's see where we are
after lap one.

785
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,410
Let's see where we are
in five races' time.

786
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,368
Hunt has the pit lane pole position,

787
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,250
which should give him the best chance
of outdragging Lauda's Ferrari.

788
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,884
If ever there was a doubt about

789
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,248
whether Lauda had
a serious challenger to this season,

790
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,921
Hunt and his McLaren
have certainly given us the answer.

791
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,725
(engines revving)

792
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,125
(commentator) Here in South Africa,

793
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,162
James Hunt is determined to make amends

794
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,284
after that disastrous retirement
in Brazil.

795
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,762
But it's Lauda who takes the flag
here at Kyalami.

796
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,490
James Hunt comes home second

797
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,006
to confirm his championship
challenge at last

798
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,809
and score his first points

799
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,410
of the season.

800
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,846
That wind you can feel
is me breathing down your neck.

801
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,962
Next time I'll have you.

802
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,331
We'll see in Spain.

803
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,684
(engine roaring)

804
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,640
(commentator) James Hunt finally takes
his first victory of the season

805
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,206
here in Spain, after a brilliant drive.

806
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,527
It was only a matter of time.

807
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,690
Luca, don't you think it's time
to tell them?

808
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,724
(speaking Italian)

809
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,721
-it's too wide.
- Disqualified.

810
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,487
- What?
- You're disqualified.

811
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,244
(Caldwell) How can we be disqualified?

812
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,169
-1.5 centimetres.
-It's the same car.

813
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,402
(Ferrari crew member) Giustissimo.

814
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,486
(indistinct)

815
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,721
You fucking...

816
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,684
(commentator) ...McLaren M23
has proved very controversial here.

817
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,643
(whirring)

818
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,563
Just make it narrower. I don't care how.

819
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,728
(Caldwell) New rear suspension.
New wishbones.

820
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,570
I wanna make sure
this thing is legal, no doubts.

821
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,081
Well, then we'd better move the
oil coolers back to the old position.

822
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,367
(man) With the oil coolers back, the
wing brackets need to be changed, too.

823
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,526
(James) Fuck.

824
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,728
(Caldwell) What the fuck
d'you think we're doing?

825
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,205
(all arguing)

826
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,764
(engine roaring)

827
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,880
(commentator) And with Hunt disqualified
from his Spain win,

828
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,526
his championship year is not going well.

829
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,126
And now it's all gone wrong
here at Monaco!

830
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,368
His engine is smoking.

831
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,442
(speaking French)

832
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,131
(commentator) Smoke pouring
from the engine of that McLaren!

833
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,685
And James Hunt is out!

834
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,240
- Can you tell us what happened?
- Sure. It's magic.

835
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,442
We've taken a great car,
a great piece of engineering,

836
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,729
and overnight turned it into
a big, huge, stinking turd.

837
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,411
(all screaming)

838
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,051
Shit!

839
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,767
What the hell have you done?
The car's evil.

840
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,484
It's fucking undriveable!

841
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,449
James, look, if there's a problem
with the car we'll find it...

842
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,482
The car is a piece of shit.
You should be appealing this.

843
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,608
- We are appealing it.
- We will sort it out.

844
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,768
- They're killing us out there.
-(Caldwell) Go and get your dick wet.

845
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,609
- You're a wanker.
-(James) Fuck you.

846
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,449
(Caldwell) You're a fucking wanker.
(James) I will, arsehole.

847
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,641
(all laughing)

848
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,324
But this was a good race for you,
no, Niki?

849
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,481
It's good for everyone

850
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,489
that the quickest car
happens to be a legal car.

851
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,331
James, you're 50 points
behind Lauda in the championship.

852
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,887
You've had another retirement today.
What's going wrong?

853
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,968
Oh, it's dirty politics
and dirty tricks,

854
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,411
that's what's going wrong.

855
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:31,007
<i>(commentator) So, as we approach
the halfway point</i>

856
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,844
in this year's Formula 1 season,

857
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,603
Ferrari and Niki Lauda
seem clearly on top,

858
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,729
and James Hunt and McLaren
are struggling.

859
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:43,287
So, five races in,
how's it going so far?

860
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,923
It's fine. Just got a little problem
with an Austrian rat

861
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,610
and his team of Italian cheats

862
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,160
-who have destroyed my car.
- What are you talking about?

863
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,362
I'm talking about the race in Spain
that I won.

864
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,689
- Yeah, in a car which is not legal.
- Five-eighths of an inch too wide.

865
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,041
You know that doesn't have
the slightest effect on speed.

866
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,527
But you complained and your team
of lawyers leaned on the authorities.

867
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,809
Now we've had to rebuild the car,
and it's become a monster.

868
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,850
- At least it's a legal monster.
- You've had to resort to cheating.

869
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,721
You're driving an illegal car
and call me the cheat? It's pathetic.

870
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,049
- Rules are rules.
- Yes, and rats are rats.

871
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,201
Thank you. Thank you.

872
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,205
Do you really think it upsets me, James,

873
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,210
calling me a rat
because I look like one?

874
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,969
I don't mind it.

875
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,889
Rats are ugly, sure,
and nobody likes them,

876
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,681
but they're very intelligent and
they have a strong survival instinct.

877
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,404
- Wonderful.
- Marlene, komm.

878
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,045
(Niki speaking German)

879
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,525
No wonder she left him.

880
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,844
(car door closes)

881
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,890
Anyone seen Suzy?

882
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,006
She's supposed to be here today.

883
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,243
We, er...didn't wanna tell you
before the race.

884
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,770
Tell me what?

885
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,565
Jesus.

886
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,805
Is that from him?

887
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,811
Yeah.

888
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,485
(snorts)

889
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,482
So when did all this start?

890
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,007
That weekend I went skiing.

891
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,087
Why have you come here, James?

892
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,085
I've come to get you back.

893
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,169
You don't want me back.

894
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,930
You never wanted to be married
in the first place.

895
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,321
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, come on, James.

896
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,400
You did it because
you hoped it might change you,

897
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,164
settle you down, help with the racing.

898
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,931
No, I didn't.

899
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,282
And who knows?
If it had been just the drinking

900
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,120
or the dope or the infidelity
or the moods,

901
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,321
it might even have worked.

902
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,929
- But when it's all of them...
- Yes, I know, I'm terrible.

903
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,843
No, you're not terrible.

904
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,003
You're just who you are
at this point in your life.

905
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,004
God help anyone who wants more.

ﬂaughs)

907
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,883
And Richard Burton,
will he able to give you more?

908
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,806
You know, he has quite
the bad boy reputation himself.

909
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,531
What's important is how it feels to me,

910
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,967
and it feels like he adores me.

911
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,891
(reporter 1) James!
(reporter 2) New York Times!

912
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,405
Are you and Suzy getting back together?

913
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,404
(reporter 2) James, how do you feel...
(James) It's all very amicable.

914
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,006
My wife has found herself
a new backer...

915
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,566
- I mean, lover, which makes her happy.
-(reporters laughing)

916
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,211
And Mr Burton has found
a way of feeling young again,

917
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,685
which makes him happy.

918
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,041
Let's hope his pockets are deep.
They'll need to be.

919
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,323
And I've found a way to be single
and have an ex-wife

920
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,084
without it costing me a penny,

921
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,322
which has got to go down
as the biggest win of my career.

922
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,131
-(reporters laugh)
- I have a flight to catch.

923
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,925
(engine starting)

924
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,771
(both moaning)

925
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,483
(engine revving)

926
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,491
(commentator) We haven't seen
this sort of intensity

927
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,170
from James Hunt all season long.

928
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,170
Reports have been coming out
of the McLaren camp all week

929
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,682
that their car is now fully legal
and faster than ever.

930
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,444
(engine roaring)

931
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,561
(commentator speaking French)

932
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,284
(cheering)

933
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,568
Never mind the bloody wets.
We're still quick.

934
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,082
Hunt has really closed the gap on Lauda
as they head into Druids.

935
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,050
Niki Lauda is under real pressure
from James Hunt

936
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,731
as they go up the hill
into Druids Corner.

937
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,524
(cheering)

938
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,403
And Hunt is in front of Lauda!

939
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,285
So James Hunt gets the plaudits

940
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,209
of the crowd, the first Briton to win

941
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:50,930
a British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch

942
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,929
since Jim Clark in 1964.

943
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,568
(Moss) James, at the moment
you've got a terrific edge

944
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,570
over the rest of the field.
How have you achieved this advantage?

945
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,564
Big balls.

946
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,130
Would you... (laughs)

947
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,250
Following an inquiry
into the disqualification

948
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,721
of driver James Hunt
from the Spanish Grand Prix,

949
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,251
it has been decided

950
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,243
-to overturn this disqualification...
-(all) Yes!

951
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,767
...and to restore his victory
and reinstate his points.

952
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,290
(excited chatter)

953
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,405
James! James!

954
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,289
(Moss) James, a few weeks ago
you were out of the running

955
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,249
for the season completely,
and now you're right back in it.

956
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,244
- What's changed?
- Well, it's a combination of factors -

957
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,448
not all of which I'm prepared
to discuss here -

958
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,804
butjustice being done
re the disqualification in Spain helps,

959
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,366
and having my car
back at its best again.

960
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,801
(both speaking German)

961
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,371
(reporters laughing)

962
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,970
(girls) James! James!

963
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,523
(speaking German)

964
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,771
(chuckles)

965
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,407
-(clears throat)
-(exhales)

966
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,051
(registrar speaking German)

967
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,251
(Marlene laughing)

968
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,041
(both speaking German)

969
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,687
Welcome to the legendary Nurburgring.

970
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,283
This is a 14.2-mile track,

971
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,128
complete with 185 corners and bends.

972
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,805
(tyres screeching)

973
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,164
(driver screaming)

974
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,165
(siren wailing)

975
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,249
(fan speaking German)

976
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,731
(Niki speaks German)

977
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,330
(thunder rumbling)

978
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,923
(Moss) Welcome to the NUrburgring,

979
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,606
the most dangerous circuit
on the season calendar.

980
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,730
In Formula 1 it is known
as the Graveyard.

981
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,569
The weather conditions
are far from ideal,

982
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,250
and latest reports indicate

983
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,010
there is no relief in sight.

984
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,724
(overlapping chatter)

985
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:59,846
Gentlemen. Well, gentlemen,
please be quiet.

986
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,082
Thank you. Niki Lauda.

987
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,805
Thank you.

988
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,923
I called this meeting because,
as all you drivers know,

989
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:10,202
the Nurburgring is the most stupid,
barbaric, outdated

990
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,730
and dangerous track in the world.

991
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,047
You've all seen the rain
that has been falling today.

992
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,721
Now, those of you with experience know
the ring needs perfect conditions

993
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,451
to be even remotely acceptable
in terms of risk.

994
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,927
And today, with the rain,
it's anything but perfect,

995
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,123
so I called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race.

996
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,282
-(driver) Cancel the race?
-(drivers protesting)

997
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,402
There would be no change
to the situation

998
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,885
as far as points is concerned.

999
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,571
- The race would simply be cancelled.
- This is bullshit.

1000
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,881
If the race is cancelled,
none of us get our race fees.

1001
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,329
That's true, you leave without your fee,
but you might leave with your life.

1002
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,644
(James) it also means that you would
effectively win the championship.

1003
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,606
So, I can see why
this suits you just fine.

1004
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,571
Why? There would be
no points for me either.

1005
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,241
No, but there would be one race less

1006
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,647
where I, or anyone else here,
could catch you.

1007
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,007
James is right. This is just tactics.

1008
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:01,765
(driver) Maybe he's just frightened.

1009
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,805
Which asshole said this?

1010
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,649
Yes, of course I'm frightened,
and so are you.

1011
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,526
I accept, every time I get in my car,
there is 20 per cent chance I could die,

1012
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,170
and I can live with it,

1013
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,282
but not one per cent more.

1014
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,641
And today, with the rain,
the risk is more.

1015
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,491
I suppose that all depends
on how good you are in the rain.

1016
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,803
I have the track record here.

1017
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,730
I am the only person in history
to do the ring in under seven minutes.

1018
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,485
So, actually, it's to my advantage
to race here today.

1019
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,521
- Because I'm quicker than all of you.
-(drivers scoffing)

1020
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,848
- Come on.
- Fine. Then let's race.

1021
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,405
(drivers agreeing)

1022
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,847
(driver) Come on, Niki, let's race.
(FIA official) Gentlemen, please.

1023
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,644
Why are we here, Niki? Come on.

1024
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,330
(scattered agreement)

1025
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,801
(sighs)

1026
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,531
Well, all those in favour
of cancelling the race.

1027
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,484
All those in favour of racing.

1028
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,047
(scattered approval)

1029
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,325
Gentlemen, the race is on.

1030
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,208
(driver 1) Ridiculous.
(driver 2) What a waste of time.

1031
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,564
You know, Niki, every now and then
it helps if people like you.

1032
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,845
(chuckles)

1033
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,046
(revving)

1034
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,048
(Moss) In places
the track is still dangerously wet,

1035
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,525
but following a drivers' meeting,

1036
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,125
a decision has finally been taken.

1037
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,361
(speaking French)

1038
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,124
(Moss) The race is going ahead.

1039
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,725
(speaking German)

1040
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,566
(spectator) Niki!

1041
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,364
(announcer) One minute to go.

1042
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:17,043
Jochen's going on slicks.
You wanna change?

1043
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,560
(James) ls Niki gonna change?
(Caldwell) No.

1044
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,722
Then we stay on wets, too.

1045
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,610
(speaking German)

1046
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,324
-(mechanic) Niki, okay?
- I'm good.

1047
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,280
-(Caldwell) All right, fire her up.
-(starts engine)

1048
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,323
(engine revving)

1049
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,246
(commentator) This season's fight for
the Formula 1 World Championship

1050
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,921
has so far been the story of two men.

1051
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,601
Thus far, it's been going
pretty much the way of Niki Lauda.

1052
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,325
But James Hunt
has qualified fastest here.

1053
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,444
He is on pole position
for the German Grand Prix,

1054
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,603
with Niki Lauda alongside
in the blood-red Ferrari.

1055
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,451
It's a long race.

1056
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,171
If the track starts to dry out,

1057
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,124
the wet-weather tyres
will no longer be as quick.

1058
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,450
(engines revving)

1059
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,810
(spectators cheering)

1060
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,127
(track commentator speaking German)

1061
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,562
(commentator) Niki Lauda
and James Hunt, side by side

1062
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,803
on the front row of the grid,
go away absolutely as one.

1063
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,207
Lauda very aggressive on Hunt there,

1064
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,322
forcing the McLaren onto the grass.

1065
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,091
Lauda has the lead at the moment.

1066
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,527
Lauda leads into the first corner.

1067
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,688
Hunt is in second place.

1068
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,931
Mass storming past Hunt!

1069
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,685
He made the right choice
to go with the dry-weather tyres.

1070
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,009
Mass passing Lauda now!

1071
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:30,045
Jochen Mass, in the number 12 McLaren,
takes the lead!

1072
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,884
Jochen Mass the clear leader,

1073
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,088
with everybody else making the decision

1074
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,282
to change tyres
afterjust one lap of this race.

1075
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,567
He's coming in! Come on, let's go!

1076
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,770
See? I told you to go on slicks.
You should have taken my advice.

1077
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,644
Fuck off. Where's Niki?

1078
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,405
(Caldwell) Behind you.
He made the same mistake.

1079
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,889
Come on!

1080
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,249
Come on! What's going on?

1081
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,082
The tyre-changing frenzy has caused
a huge reshuffling of the pack,

1082
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,090
-with Jochen Mass in the lead now.
-(pitman) You're clear. Go!

1083
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,766
Quick!

1084
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,004
Lauda urging his mechanics to hurry.

1085
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,241
Quicker, quicker, quicker!

1086
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,082
It's a disaster! Come on!

1087
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,210
What's going on, you assholes?

1088
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,322
(speaking Italian)

1089
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,521
(speaking German)

1090
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,122
This race has gone wrong for him so far.

1091
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,647
His championship rival, James Hunt,
is a long way up the road.

1092
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,965
Lauda passing car after car.

1093
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,482
He's just going past
Mario Andretti's Lotus there.

1094
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,521
(groans)

1095
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,202
-(driver) Niki!
-(coughing)

1096
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,129
(Merzario speaking Italian)

1097
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,126
(groaning)

1098
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,282
Get me out! Help me!

1099
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,201
(announcer) We have an accident
on the course. Red flags are out.

1100
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:33,520
Several cars are involved. Looks like
it might be one of the Ferraris.

1106
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,731

01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,245
(Merzario speaking Italian)

1108
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,970
(driver 1) Come this way.
(driver 2) Okay.

1109
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,001
(radio announcer speaking German)

1110
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,882

(speaking German)

1114
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,767
(reporter on TV) The flood, which swept
down Big Thompson Canyon in Colorado,

1115
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,524
was the worst since records began.

1116
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,086
In Formula 1 today,
victory celebrations were muted

1117
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,926
after a horrific accident involving
world champion Niki Lauda.

1118
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,923
Due to safety concerns before the race,

1119
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,367
the Austrian had said
he would not take part,

1120
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,890
but in the end he did.

1121
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,567
He was making up for lost time
when he went off the track,

1122
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,047
puncturing the Ferrari's fuel tank.

1123
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,727
Brett Lunger was unable to
avoid the flaming wreck,

1124
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,804
but was unhurt and joined with
the other drivers to rescue Lauda,

1125
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,770
who was taken to Mannheim Hospital
with severe burns,

1126
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,521
the incident reminding us again
of the dangers of Formula 1.

1127
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,642
Niki Lauda was trapped
for almost a minute

1128
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:25,371
in a searing inferno
of 800-plus degrees.

1129
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,407
- Do we have any change this morning?
- No...

1130
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,403
(doctor) Frau Lauda. Frau Lauda?

1131
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,402

(indistinct chatter on PA)

1163
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,049
- Morning, chaps.
- Hey, here's the man.

1164
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,890
Looking good.

1165
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,002
(spectators speaking Italian)

1166
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,930
- What's going on?
- Jesus. It's Niki.

1167
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,048
- What about him?
- He's here.

1168
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,885
- What?
- He's racing.

1169
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,926
(clicking)

1170
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,604
(reporters clamouring)

1171
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:42,890
Niki.

1172
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,045
It's that bad, huh?

1173
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,771
No.

1174
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,564
In hospital I asked them straight,
no bullshit,

1175
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,483
how bad my appearance would be.

1176
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,087
They said with time it would be fine.

1177
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,564
But it won't.

1178
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:09,324
I can tell, seeing your reaction.

1179
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:13,284
I will spend the rest of my life
with a face that frightens people.

1180
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,166
You know, Niki, I tried to write you
a letter at the time, to apologise.

1181
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,280
The drivers' meeting in Germany,
before the race.

1182
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,926
- I swayed the room.
- Yes, you did.

1183
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,327
That race should never have gone ahead.

1184
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,684
No, it shouldn't.

1185
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,761
So, in many ways, I feel responsible
for what happened, and...

1186
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,410
You were.

1187
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,809
But, trust me...

1188
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,010
watching you win those races
while I was fighting for my life...

1189
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:52,529
...you were equally responsible
for getting me back in the car.

1190
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,126
-(cameras clicking)
-(overlapping chatter)

1191
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,965
- How are you feeling, Niki?
- Fine.

1192
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:26,967
Niki, can you confirm to us exactly
which procedures you've had

1193
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,002
and the expectations for your recovery?

1194
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,005
Sure.

1195
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,969
I had a skin graft operation,

1196
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,321
where they put half my right thigh
in my face.

1197
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:42,321
Now, it doesn't look too good,
but one unexpected advantage is

1198
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:44,647
it's impossible to perspire
through a skin graft,

1199
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:48,088
so sweat will never run into my eyes
again, which is good for a driver.

1200
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,571
(laughing)

1201
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,010
When they heard about your condition,

1202
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:55,487
Ferrari immediately hired
a replacement driver, Carlos Reutemann.

1203
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:00,165
Yeah, before even reaching the hospital.

1204
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,248
(French reporter)
ls Reutemann driving today, too?

1205
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:05,684
Yes, and keen to make an impression.

1206
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,851
So, let's see where Mr Reutemann
finishes and where I finish today.

1207
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,370
(reporters laughing)

1208
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:14,085
James Hunt and McLaren have
caught up a lot while you were away.

1209
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,210
Yes.

1210
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,764
So is there a question now,
or are you just trying to piss me off?

1211
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,410
(reporters laughing)

1212
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,849
You still think you can win?

1213
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,044
Yes, of course.

1214
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,082
- I have the better car.
-(cameras clicking)

1215
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,680
And possibly I'm the better driver.

1216
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,281
But he's a clever guy,
and he's used his time well

1217
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:38,410
while I was lying half-dead in hospital
to win some points.

1218
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,245
(scattered laughing)

1219
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:43,045
And what did your wife say
when she saw your face?

1220
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:52,722
She said, "Sweetie,
you don't need a face to drive.

1221
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,928
-"You just need a right foot."
-(reporters laughing)

1222
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,607
(Clive) I'm being serious.

1223
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:02,283
Do you really think your marriage can
survive with the way you look now?

1224
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,968
And I'm being serious, too.

1225
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:10,930
- Fuck you. Press conference over.
-(cameras clicking)

1226
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,849
(reporters clamouring)

1227
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,929
(Clive) That was hairy.
(man) Well, you got noticed, Clive.

1228
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:19,246
I'll tell you that.

1229
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,924
(Clive) I thought it went well,
to be honest.

1230
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,764
They don't like it
when it's not going their way.

1231
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,484
-(James) Clive.
- That's the game.

1232
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,841
- See you.
- See you later.

1233
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,809
- James, are you all right?
- Good, yeah.

1234
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,604
Listen, I think
I've got something for you

1235
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,444
on that last question, about Niki.

1236
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,086
-(laughs) You heard about that?
- I did.

1237
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,049
James. (groaning)

1238
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:46,851
(coughing) Please, James...

1239
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,764
Now go home to your wife
and ask her how you look.

1240
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,611
Prick.

1241
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,008

-(door opening)

1243
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:16,361
So Niki Lauda, just 42 days after
his near-fatal accident at Nurburgring,

1244
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,970
will race here today at Monza

1245
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:21,806
against all medical advice
and no doubt in incredible pain.

1246
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,170
(track commentator) ...Niki Lauda!

1247
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:57,844
(spectators cheering)

1248
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:07,281
(announcer) Photographers,
please clear the grid.

1249
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,682
(mechanic) Niki, it's time.

1250
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,690
Okay?

1251
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,210
(engines revving)

1252
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,771
(announcer) Please clear the grid.

1253
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,528
One minute to go.

1254
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,085

01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:14,164
(commentator) The returning Niki Lauda
seems overwhelmed.

1259
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,686
He's being overtaken by car after car.

1260
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,090
(speaking Italian)

1261
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,609
(commentator) Lauda's off line.
He runs wide onto the grass.

1262
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,124
He wrestles it back onto the track,

1263
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,130
but that was a bad moment for Niki.

1264
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,207
Niki Lauda's the reigning
world champion,

1265
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:48,489
but maybe in his current state
he's a danger out there,

1266
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,450
to himself and to the rest of the field.

1267
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:57,331
And Stuck has collided
with Mario Andretti's Lotus!

1268
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,643
Niki's boxed in. He's got nowhere to go.

1269
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,483
(track commentator speaking Italian)

1270
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:18,641
(commentator) Niki Lauda is actually
making a move. He's on Brambilla's tail.

1271
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,571
He pulls out of the slipstream
to overtake.

1272
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,641
Lauda's starting to find the form

1273
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,728
that, early in this race,
we believed he'd lost.

1274
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,245
Lauda's now lapping faster than
Reutemann and closing the gap ahead.

1275
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,731
Lauda closing on Carlos Reutemann,

1276
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,003
the man called in to be his replacement
in the Ferrari team.

1277
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,849
And there's James Hunt's McLaren,

1278
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,406
smoking stationary
by the side of the road.

1279
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,123
This is bad news for Hunt's
championship hopes.

1280
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,931
It's Ronnie Peterson

1281
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,407
who comes home the winner here at Monza.

1282
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,490
But all eyes are on the man
who finishes a brilliant fourth,

1283
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,568
- Niki Lauda!
-(spectators cheering)

1284
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:30,568
(track commentator speaking Italian)

1285
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,962
(speaking Italian)

1286
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,761
(Moss) What a race, what a man,
what a season.

1287
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,002
With a fourth-place finish
and three priceless points,

1288
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,082
it means that Niki Lauda
is a major step closer

1289
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,327
to retaining the World Championship.

1290
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,886
(thunder rumbling)

1291
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:17,007
(commentator) So, the long, gruelling
and incredibly dramatic season

1292
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,407
comes down to this final race in Japan

1293
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:22,006
in the shadow of Mount Fuji.

1294
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,525
Niki Lauda goes into

1295
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,005
this deciding race at Fuji

1296
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,242
just three points ahead of James Hunt.

1297
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:31,609
Hunt knowing he must beat the Austrian
fair and square to take the title.

1298
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:36,687
James, do you think
you can cope with the pressure?

1299
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:40,247
Well, I've never really understood
what that means. I love my job.

1300
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,408
I love competing. I love racing.

1301
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,443
Maybe you should ask Niki.

1302
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,841
He's the World Champion.
He's got everything to lose.

1303
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,201
(Japanese reporter) Mr Lauda,
are you feeling pressure?

1304
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,726
- Do I look like I'm feeling pressure?
-(scattered laughing)

1305
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:57,930
I am World Champion, and on the verge
to become World Champion again.

1306
01:30:58,040 --> 01:31:00,042
Hunt now has the opportunity to win,

1307
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,202
but it's not so easy
to become a champion.

1308
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:05,409
You have to really believe it
to make it possible.

1309
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,608
James, is there anything
you'd like to add?

1310
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:11,645
If Niki is being tricky and getting
a kicky out of playing mind games...

1311
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:14,087
-(all laughing)
-...then fine, I'm flattered.

1312
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:17,761
But the fact is, momentum is with me.
I've never felt better.

1313
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,451
And I fully expect the next
press conference we will have

1314
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,722
will be with me as World Champion.

1315
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,480
(reporters clamouring)

1316
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:27,006
(reporter) How will you cope
with the weather, bad conditions?

1317
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:30,562
Intermittent heavy rain
has been forecast here at Fuji today,

1318
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:34,122
along with strong winds
and occasional fog

1319
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:36,129
rolling in from the mountain.

1320
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,571
(commentator) And so, with today's
Japanese Grand Prix to come,

1321
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,404
Lauda's lead a mere three points.

1322
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,164
What a way to finish the season.

1323
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,250
Hunt or Lauda?

1324
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:49,324
Well, the final chapter will unfold when
we bring you extended coverage...

1325
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,489
They've got to cancel the race.
It's lethal out there.

1326
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,688
The race is going ahead.

1327
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,603
Television rights have been sold
all around the world.

1328
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:59,331
The showdown between you and Niki
is all anyone wants to see.

1329
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,802
(commentator) With heavy rain
continuing to fall here at Fuji,

1330
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,962
a decision has finally been made.

1331
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:09,005
The 1976 Japanese Grand Prix
will go ahead.

1332
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,765
(announcer) All drivers
to your cars, please.

1333
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:18,001
(exhales)

1334
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,811
Five minutes to go.

1335
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,362
(announcer speaking Japanese)

1336
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:20,009
(mechanic speaks Italian)

1337
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,445
- All right?
- All right.

1338
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:24,841
- Hold still.
- What the hell are you doing?

1339
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,649
To let the condensation out.

1340
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:29,451
- It'll also let the water in.
- Not if you're leading.

1341
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,887
Trust me,
this race is all about the start.

1342
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:36,371
(Mayer) Need a hand here?
(Caldwell) Yeah, hold it, Teddy.

1343
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:52,490
Okay, start the bastard.

1344
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,843
(starts engine)

1345
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,130
Good luck, kid.

1346
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:59,931
(Mayer) Good luck, James.

1347
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:07,244
(engine revving)

1348
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,482
(announcer) Thirty seconds to go.

1349
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,085
(engines revving)

1350
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:03,082
(commentator)
Electric tension here at Fuji.

1351
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:08,200
80, 000 bedraggled race fans and
the racing grudge match of the decade.

1352
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,408
And there's Mario Andretti
in pole position,

1353
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,482
James Hunt alongside him.

1354
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,563
On Row 2 of the grid,

1355
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,529
there is Niki Lauda,

1356
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,046
and on Row 3 of the grid,
Jody Scheckter from South Africa

1357
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:22,565
in the six-wheel Tyrrell.

1358
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,722
Behind him,
the rest of the 25-car field.

1359
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,410
(engines continue revving)

1360
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:46,565
There's the flag, and finally
the Japanese Grand Prix is underway!

1361
01:35:52,640 --> 01:35:54,244
(spectators cheering)

1362
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,963
In these conditions,
it must be almost impossible to drive

1363
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,042
a 450-horsepower car.

1364
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,202
(engines roaring)

1365
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:34,204
And it's Andretti who has the lead,
but Hunt is attacking.

1366
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:37,250
Hunt's going round
the outside of Andretti.

1367
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:38,890
Niki Lauda following him through.

1368
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,725
Hunt leads into the first right-hander.

1369
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:03,724
(Speaking Japanese)

1370
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,482
(commentator speaking Japanese)

1371
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,001
(speaking French)

1372
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,529
(commentator) Hunt comes through
to complete his first lap,

1373
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,011
leading the field.

1374
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,208
At least he has clear vision
in front of him.

1375
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,482
Niki Lauda, behind him,
eating his spray.

1376
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,371
Lauda is slowing.

1377
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:56,330
Niki Lauda is bringing
the Ferrari number one into the pit.

1378
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:57,890
(Speaking Japanese)

1379
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,289
Some sort of problem, we can't
imagine what, so early in the race.

1380
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,047
(mechanic) What's wrong with the car?
What's wrong with the car?

1381
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,929
Niki, what's wrong with the car?

1382
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,362
Nothing. Car's perfect.

1383
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,204
(mechanic speaking Italian)

1384
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,127
- What are you doing?
- I'm stopping.

1385
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:25,362
(commentator) His mechanics
are asking what the problem is.

1386
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,761
But wait!
Niki Lauda's getting out of the car!

1387
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:29,484
This is sensational!

1388
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:32,484
The reigning World Champion,
Niki Lauda, is out of this race.

1389
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,084
- It's too dangerous.
-(speaks Italian)

1390
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:38,369
Niki, you want me to say there was
a problem with the car, for the media?

1391
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:41,170
No.

1392
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:42,971
Tell them the truth.

1393
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,410
(commentator) Now, what is happening?

1394
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:49,445
They're talking to the team manager.
Lauda explaining something.

1395
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:08,288
With Lauda out, James Hunt
knows he has to finish this race

1396
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:12,126
in third place or higher
to be World Champion.

1397
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:14,885
But the job's not done yet
for James Hunt.

1398
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:19,568
In these dreadful conditions,
he still has to go the distance.

1399
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,523
Fifteen laps to go here at Fuji.

1400
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,722
James Hunt or Niki Lauda ?

1401
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,883
This extraordinary season
is not over yet.

1402
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:31,407
In this treacherous final round,
can James Hunt hang on?

1403
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:33,763
And the scoreboard tells a story.

1404
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,650
Lap 58. Hunt in the lead.

1405
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,483
Oh, God, his tyres, they're blistering.

1406
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,884
(commentator on TV)
Brambilla very close behind now,

1407
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:45,928
closing on him all the time now.

1408
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:49,203
And he's trying to drive
inside James Hunt.

1409
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,806
Hunt cuts across the orange March nose.

1410
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,207
Hunt's not having that at all.
And he's spinning.

1411
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,443
He missed Hunt there, but almost
took James Hunt out of the race

1412
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,887
and out of the world championship.

1413
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,691
Now we find Mario Andretti
closing on James Hunt.

1414
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,208
Mario Andretti's going past Hunt!

1415
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,684
Hunt is slowing. James Hunt
seems to have a problem.

1416
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:20,284
Despite these wet conditions,

1417
01:40:20,360 --> 01:40:22,089
these wet-weather tyres
do wear extremely fast.

1418
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:24,328
Hunt's tyres, they've gone.

1419
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:28,246
(commentator) Hunt nursing his car
back to the pit stop.

1420
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:32,288
That back marker's going past Hunt.

1421
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:47,405
Look at that left front tyre...
Right front tyre, sorry.

1422
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:50,643
No tread on it at all.
And the other one is flat.

1423
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,928
Let's go! Let's go!

1424
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:57,401
(James grunts angrily)

1425
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,881
Okay? When did you break
your gear lever?

1426
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,564
Nine or ten laps ago.

1427
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:04,086
- Alastair, we need to lift it.
- Come on!

1428
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,884
(mechanic) At the front.
(James) Let's go.

1429
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:09,169
(commentator) Regazzoni's Ferrari
and Jacques Lafitte in the Ligier

1430
01:41:09,240 --> 01:41:10,890
have gone ahead.

1431
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,604
Come on, hurry!

1432
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:15,729
(mechanic) You did it.
You're going to be World Champion!

1433
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,245
Not yet.

1434
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:21,086
(commentator) A few laps ago, James Hunt
was looking like champion elect.

1435
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,527
Now it looks as though
it's all gone wrong for him.

1436
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,371
- James.
- Come on!

1437
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:27,885
- Listen.
- What?

1438
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,201
Just go easy out there.

1439
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:34,251
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying look after yourself.

1440
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,209
We want you back in one piece.

1441
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:39,648
You're too far back. There's
too many drivers in front of you.

1442
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:43,725
- There's always next year.
- So that's it? It's over?

1443
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:45,610
(mechanic) Clear!

1444
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:47,205
(Caldwell) James.

1445
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,803
-(mechanic) Clear!
- Fuck it!

1446
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:57,963
James Hunt rejoins the race
in sixth position.

1447
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:01,931
There are four laps left to go.
Surely no way back for the Brit now.

1448
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,040
Concentrate, Superstar.

1449
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:24,924
(commentator)
Just brings it back under control.

1450
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:26,246
Sliding the McLaren

1451
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:27,560
on the very edge there.

1452
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:30,766
(American commentator)
Hunt's M23

1453
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,450
twitching this way and that
under braking.

1454
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:33,925
And he almost loses it right there.

1455
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,287
(commentator) Hunt on the tail
of Jacques Lafitte in the blue Ligier.

1456
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,171
Oh, don't do it, James.

1457
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,170
(commentator) He's inches away
from the pit wall.

1458
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:53,049
He's inches away from the Ligier.

1459
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:01,085
(mechanic speaks Italian)

1460
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,481
James Hunt has made up another place,

1461
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:05,561
but it's not enough,

1462
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:06,880
and this race is running out.

1463
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:17,922
And Watson has spun.
Watson has spun.

1464
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,325
Hunt manages to weave his way
between that back marker

1465
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:27,402
and the stationary Penske.

1466
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:29,482
He's catching Regazzoni

1467
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,210
but, in these conditions,
it's one thing to catch up,

1468
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:33,487
it's quite another to overtake.

1469
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,010
He's alongside Clay Regazzoni.
This could be the world championship.

1470
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:50,965
He's got him!

1471
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:53,282
(Speaking Japanese)

1472
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:08,322
Hunt crosses the line.

1473
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:12,007
Now, he needed to finish third to score
enough points to be World Champion,

1474
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:16,608
and in the confusion here, we're being
told that he may have finished fifth.

1475
01:44:16,680 --> 01:44:18,808
- He finished fifth?
-(speaks Italian)

1476
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:21,690
(commentator) Our lap charts
show Hunt in third place.

1477
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,683
Well, if the scoreboard's right,

1478
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,286
it means he's just missed out
on the championship.

1479
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:30,001
Crushing defeat for Hunt
after such a heroic drive.

1480
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:36,486
I can see the race stewards conferring,

1481
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,210
examining the official lap charts.

1482
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:40,681
We're just going to have to wait
for their verdict here.

1483
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,043
(men speaking Italian)

1484
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,890
(Mayer)
Let's get you out of there, buddy.

1485
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,042
I'm sorry, Teddy. I'm sorry.
I thought I could make up the ground.

1486
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:04,202
Sorry? What are you talking about?
(laughs) You did it.

1487
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:07,045
- Did what?
- Jesus. You crazy bastard.

1488
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:10,329
You came third. You got the points.
You're champion of the world!

1489
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:14,083
(commentator) James Hunt
is now officially confirmed

1490
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,248
as finishing third here in Japan,

1491
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:20,521
and that means
he is champion of the world.

1492
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:21,886
(all cheering)

1493
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,291
Our new World Champion,
James Hunt, by just one single point.

1494
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,442
(spectators cheering)

1495
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:33,970
(James on TV) Did we really win?

1496
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,966
(cheering)

1497
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,281
World bloody Champion!

1498
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:50,969
(Moss) Tell us, James,
what are you going to do now?

1499
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,202
- I shall be getting drunk.
-(all laughing)

1500
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:56,451
(James) It's wonderful,
an absolute dream...

1501
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,761
(reporters clamouring)

1502
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,284
(both speaking German)

1503
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,363
(spectators cheering)

1504
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,442
(TV show host) And our special guest,

1505
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,363
Formula 1 champion James Hunt.

1506
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:12,842
Wait. Come on.

1507
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,490
There's no better motor oil

1508
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,164
than Havoline.

1509
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:29,605
(all laughing)

1510
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:31,603
(woman) Yes, me, too.
Where are we going?

1511
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:33,170
Anywhere I want to go.

1512
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,481
- And I don't have to hijack it, either.
-(women laughing)

1513
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:37,210
As long as I pay for it.

1514
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,601
(woman) I'm starving.
Let's get some food.

1515
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:52,449
(woman) Where are we going?
(James) You lot go ahead.

1516
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:54,488
- I won't be a minute.
-(woman laughs)

1517
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,004
Good to see you.

1518
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,481
I heard you were spending
more and more time in one of these.

1519
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,848
- Do you fly?
-(chuckles) No.

1520
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:12,730
I don't think they'd insure me.

1521
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,723
You should try.
It's good for discipline.

1522
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:17,400
You have to stay within the rules,
stick to regulations,

1523
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,091
suppress the ego.
It helps with the racing.

1524
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:23,170
And there I was thinking
you were about to wax lyrical

1525
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:24,844
about the romance of flight.

1526
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,770
No, that's all bullshit.

1527
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,365
So, what brings you here?

1528
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:33,000
A friend's wedding.
At least I think it was a wedding.

1529
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:35,924
Might have been a birthday or something.
It's all a bit of a blur. (chuckles)

1530
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,286
How about you? Have you been at Fiorano?

1531
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:38,481
Pre-season testing.

1532
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,523
- You're relentless.
- Thank you.

1533
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,762
I'm not sure that was meant
as a compliment.

1534
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:45,127
When do you start testing? Next week?

1535
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:47,128
No. What, are you nuts?

1536
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:48,929
I didn't just win
the biggest thing of my life

1537
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,445
so I could get right back to work.

1538
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:54,445
Why? You have to.

1539
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:58,128
To prove to all the people who will
always say you just won it because...

1540
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:01,602
Because of what?
Because of your accident?

1541
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:05,168
Niki, is that other people,
or is that you?

1542
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:08,883
I won, okay? On the all-important day,
when it came down to it,

1543
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,804
we raced on equal terms,
equally good cars.

1544
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:14,042
And I put my life on the line,
and I saw it through.

1545
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:16,168
- And you call that winning?
- Yes.

1546
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:18,362
- The risks were totally unacceptable.
-(sighs)

1547
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:21,360
You were prepared to die.
To me, that's losing.

1548
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:23,050
Yes, I was. I admit it.

1549
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:25,964
I was prepared to die
to beat you that day.

1550
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,970
And that's the effect you have on me.
You'd pushed me that far.

1551
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,491
And it felt great.

1552
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,721
I mean, hell,
isn't that what we're in this for?

1553
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:37,168
To stare death in the face
and to cheat it?

1554
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,320
Come on, there's nobility in that.
It's... It's like being knights.

1555
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,084
(laughs)
You English, you're such assholes.

1556
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,485
You know my position.

1557
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:48,171
Twenty per cent risk.

1558
01:49:48,240 --> 01:49:52,006
No, no, no, Niki, don't bring the
percentages into this. Don't be a pro.

1559
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:54,691
The minute you do that,
you kill what's good about this.

1560
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,764
You kill the sport.

1561
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:01,530
(man) James!

1562
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,683
- James!
- Come on!

1563
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:08,045
I've got to go.

1564
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,528
Careful in this thing.

1565
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:14,050
James.

1566
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:23,046
You know, in hospital, the toughest part
of my treatment was the vacuum.

1567
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:26,284
Pumping the shit out of my lungs.
It was hell.

1568
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,283
And while doing it,
I was watching television.

1569
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:32,645
- You winning all my points.
- Your points?

1570
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:34,927
"That bastard Hunt," I would say.
"I hate that guy."

1571
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:37,562
And then one day
the doctor came and said,

1572
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:39,927
"Mr Lauda,
may I offer a piece of advice?

1573
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:43,726
"Stop thinking of it as a curse to
have been given an enemy in life.

1574
01:50:43,800 --> 01:50:45,962
"It can be a blessing, too.

1575
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,805
"A wise man gets more from his enemies
than a fool from his friends."

1576
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,727
And you know what? He was right.

1577
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:58,086
Look at us. We were both
a pair of kids when we met.

1578
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:59,929
Hot-headed jerks in Formula 3.

1579
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:01,803
-(laughs)
- Disowned by our families.

1580
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,285
Headed nowhere.

1581
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:06,687
And now we're both
champions of the world.

1582
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,171
It was not bad, huh?

1583
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:11,163
No, it's not bad.

1584
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:14,801
So, don't let me down now.
I need you busting my balls.

1585
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:18,005
- Get back to work.
- I will, Niki, I will.

1586
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:20,808
But I intend to enjoy myself first.

1587
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:23,481
Some of life needs to be for pleasure.

1588
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:26,922
What's the point of having
a million cups and medals and planes

1589
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,162
if you don't have any fun?

1590
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:31,689
How is that winning?

1591
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:35,491
(man) James!
(woman) We're gonna leave without you!

1592
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,445
James!

1593
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,691
I'll see you on race day, champ.

1594
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:46,602
You will...champ.

1595
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:50,884
You look good, Niki.

1596
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:54,330
The only guy to have his face burnt off
and it be an improvement.

1597
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:03,208
(Niki) Of course,
he didn't listen to me.

1598
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,725
For James,

1599
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,962
one world title was enough.

1600
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,490
He had proved

1601
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:11,808
what he needed to prove, to himself

1602
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:14,167
and anyone who doubted him.

1603
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,889
And two years later he retired.

1604
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:20,801
When I saw him next in London
seven years later,

1605
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:23,048
me as champion again,

1606
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:25,049
him as broadcaster,

1607
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:29,523
he was barefoot
on a bicycle with a flat tyre.

1608
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:32,484
Still living each day like his last.

1609
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:35,730
When I heard he'd died,

1610
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,207
aged 45, of a heart attack,

1611
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,845
I wasn't surprised.

1612
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:42,729
I was just sad.

1613
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:45,923
People always think of us as rivals,

1614
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,607
but he was among the very few I liked,

1615
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:53,890
and even fewer that I respected.

1616
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:59,771
He remains the only person I envied.

1617
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:40,802
