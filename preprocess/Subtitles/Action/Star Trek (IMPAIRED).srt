1
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,702
- USS Kelvin, go for Starfleet base.
- Starfleet Base.

2
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:24,582
We sent you a transmission.
Did you receive it?

3
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:26,073
Kelvin, can you double-check those readings?

4
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:28,849
Our gravitational sensors are going crazy
here. You should see this.

5
00:01:28,884 --> 00:01:30,329
It looks like a lightning storm.

6
00:01:30,364 --> 00:01:32,026
What you've sent us doesn't seem possible.

7
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:34,219
Yes mam, I understand.
That's why we sent it.

8
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:37,376
- Report.
- Still out of visual range. 20 seconds.

9
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,744
Alert captain Robau that Starfleet advised to
proceed with caution ...

10
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:43,180
Polarize the view screen.

11
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:45,847
- Whatever this is... Klingon origin?
- Captain, we have visual.

12
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:49,087
- Repeat. Could this be Klingon?
- Negative, lieutenant.

13
00:01:49,123 --> 00:01:50,994
You're 75 000 kilometers
from the Klingon border.

14
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:53,379
Captain, are you seeing this?

15
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:57,349
My God.

16
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,843
I have a reading.
They've locked weapons on us!

17
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:20,991
Red alert!

18
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:23,665
Torpedo locked on us at 320°- 2!
Arm weapons!

19
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:28,039
Evasive pattern delta 5!

20
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:31,473
We're being cut like grass.

21
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:40,186
Fire all phasers!
Damage report.

22
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:43,114
Warp drive's been knocked out.
Never seen anything like this.

23
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,600
Weapons offline.
Main power at 38%.

24
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:48,805
- They're firing another!
- All power to forward shields!

25
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:59,483
Help me ...

26
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:05,808
... maneuver has been lost.

27
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:06,813
Are shields even on?

28
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:08,806
... decks 17 and 13, we have
confirmed casualties.

29
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:11,502
11% and dropping. 10%.
Shields at 9%.

30
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:13,577
All remaining power to forward shields.

31
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:15,377
Prepare shuttles for evacuation.

32
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,142
Hello.

33
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:22,794
My commander requests the presence of
your captain

34
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:25,382
in order to negotiate a ceasefire.

35
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:30,964
You will come aboard our ship via shuttlecraft.
Your refusal would be unwise.

36
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:46,406
Walk with me.

37
00:03:51,337 --> 00:03:54,600
If I don't report in 15 minutes
evacuate the crew.

38
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:57,471
- Sir, we could ...
- There is no outpost out here.

39
00:03:57,563 --> 00:04:01,277
Use autopilot and get off this ship.

40
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:02,766
Aye captain.

41
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:05,155
You're captain now, Mr. Kirk.

42
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:21,025
His heart rate is elevated.

43
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:44,586
Look at the ship.

44
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:49,707
- Are you familiar with this craft?
- Who is your commander?

45
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,851
- Is that him?
- I will speak for captain Nero.

46
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:59,804
Then ask captain Nero:
What gives him the right to attack a Federation vessel.

47
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:16,007
Do you know the location of
ambassador Spock?

48
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,249
I'm unfamiliar with
ambassador Spock.

49
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:25,886
- What is the current star date?
- Star date?

50
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:30,173
2233.04.

51
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:33,818
Where are you from?

52
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,446
Terminated.

53
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:43,371
- Sir, they have a lock on our signal.
- They're launching again.

54
00:06:43,372 --> 00:06:45,122
Bravo 6 maneuver fire, full spread!

55
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,234
I'm initiating general order 13, we're evacuating!

56
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,238
Sir.

57
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:08,100
All decks, this is the captain speaking,
evacuate the ship immediately.

58
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:10,389
Get your ... to the shuttlecraft.
Begin evacuating ...

59
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:14,027
- That's George's voice. What's happening?
- We'll deliver it in the shuttle. Go!

60
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,486
- George.
- You're OK, thank God.

61
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:31,768
I have medical shuttle 37 standing by.
Get to it now. Can you do that?

62
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:33,413
- Yes.
- Everything's gonna be OK.

63
00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:38,483
- Do exactly as I say, shuttle 37.
- George, it's coming.

64
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:41,610
- Our baby. It's coming now.
- I'm on my way.

65
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:51,748
Autopilot function has been destroyed.
Manual operation only.

66
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:55,618
Clear those decks now! Get to the shuttles!
Move! Move! Move!

67
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,834
- That was a big one!
- Just keep breathing. You'll be fine.

68
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:05,915
- And the baby too, right?
- And the baby too.

69
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:13,372
Right here.

70
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:20,223
Captain to shuttle 37.
Is my wife on board?

71
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:22,827
- Yes sir, she is.
- I need you to go now. Do you hear me?

72
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:25,732
- We're waiting on you sir.
- No, just go, take off immediately.

73
00:08:26,092 --> 00:08:27,833
- That's an order.
- Yes sir.

74
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:30,017
Wait. We're not going yet.

75
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:35,014
Please stop.

76
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:39,955
George, the shuttle's leaving. Where are you?

77
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:43,914
Sweetheart, listen to me.
I'm not gonna be there.

78
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:46,534
- No.
- This is the only way you'll survive.

79
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:49,400
Please don't stay on the ship. Come to me here.

80
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:51,659
The shuttles will never make it if I don't
fight them off.

81
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,682
George, I can't do this without you.

82
00:08:54,683 --> 00:08:57,108
OK, I need you to push now!

83
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:38,626
SYSTEMS FAILING

84
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:45,305
COLLISION COURSE
ENGAGED

85
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,750
- What is it?
- It's a boy.

86
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:17,755
A boy?

87
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:23,923
- Tell me about him.
- He's beautiful.

88
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,127
George, you should be here.

89
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,055
Impact alert.

90
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:36,074
- What are we gonna call him?
- We can name him after your father.

91
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:39,457
Tiberius, you kiddin' me?
No, that's the worst.

92
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:44,136
Let's name him after your dad.
Let's call him Jim.

93
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,057
Jim. OK. Jim it is.

94
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:56,726
- Sweetheart can you hear me?
- I can hear...

95
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:58,385
I love you so much.

96
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,106
I love you!

97
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:54,432
STAR TREK

98
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,841
Hey, are you out of your mind?
That car is an antique.

99
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:24,113
You think you can get away with this
just because your mother's off planet.

100
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:30,488
You get your ass back home now! You live in my
house buddy. You live in my house and that's my car.

101
00:12:30,489 --> 00:12:33,985
You get one scratch on that car
and I'm gonna whip your ass ...

102
00:12:57,378 --> 00:13:00,110
Hey Johnny!

103
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:21,754
Citizen, pull over.

104
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:49,678
Noooo...!

105
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,417
Is there a problem officer?

106
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:20,396
Citizen, what is your name?

107
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:23,914
My name is James Tiberius Kirk.

108
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:46,471
- What is the formula for the volume of a sphere?
- 4/3 PI times the radius cubed ...

109
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,823
1.26 ...

110
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:03,029
- What is the dimensionality ...
- Dimensionality equals the logarithm of n divided by ...

111
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,038
... non-excludability and non-rivalry ...

112
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,090
... 4/3 PI times the radius ...

113
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:09,921
... is morally praiseworthy
but not morally obligatory.

114
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:15,181
Spock.

115
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:20,116
I presume you've prepared new insults for today?

116
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:22,465
Affirmative.

117
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:33,708
This is your 35th attempt to illicit an emotional
response from me.

118
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:36,450
You're neither Human nor Vulcan and
therefore have no place in this universe.

119
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:39,629
Look, his Human eyes.
They look sad. Don't they.

120
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:42,916
Perhaps an emotional response
requires physical stimulae.

121
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,987
He's a traitor you know? Your father.

122
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,770
For marrying her. That Human whore.

123
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:21,207
They called you a traitor.

124
00:16:25,454 --> 00:16:28,339
Emotions run deep within our race.

125
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,913
In many ways more deeply than in humans.

126
00:16:30,914 --> 00:16:34,807
Logic offers a serenity humans
seldom experience.

127
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:40,280
The control of feelings ...
so that they do not control you.

128
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:47,010
You suggest that I should be completely Vulcan?

129
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:49,234
And yet you married a Human.

130
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:51,403
As ambassador to Earth it is my duty to
observe

131
00:16:51,404 --> 00:16:54,338
and understand Human behavior.

132
00:16:54,877 --> 00:16:59,290
Marrying your mother was ... logical.

133
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:03,242
Spock.

134
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:07,252
You are fully capable of deciding
your own destiny.

135
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:13,758
The question you face is:
Which path will you choose?

136
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,380
This is something only you can decide.

137
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,654
Spock. Come here, let me see you.

138
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:30,173
- No.
- Spock.

139
00:17:37,865 --> 00:17:42,183
There's no need to be anxious.
You'll do fine.

140
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:44,431
I am hardly anxious, mother.

141
00:17:44,532 --> 00:17:47,795
And fine has variable definitions,
fine is unacceptable.
- OK.

142
00:17:58,156 --> 00:18:01,668
- May I ask a personal query?
- Anything.

143
00:18:04,107 --> 00:18:07,261
Should I choose to complete the Vulcan
discipline of Kolinahr.

144
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,136
and purge all emotion?

145
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:16,079
I trust you will not feel it reflects
judgment upon you.

146
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh Spock.

147
00:18:22,154 --> 00:18:28,883
As always, whatever you choose to be,
you will have a proud mother.

148
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:37,249
You have surpassed the expectations of
your instructors.

149
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:41,730
Your final record is flawless.
With one exception.

150
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:45,129
I see that you have applied to
Starfleet as well.

151
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:48,373
It was logical to cultivate more options.

152
00:18:48,374 --> 00:18:53,270
Logical, but unnecessary. You are hereby
accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.

153
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:56,713
It is truly remarkable Spock that you have
achieved so much

154
00:18:56,714 --> 00:18:59,050
despite your disadvantage.

155
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:01,696
All rise.

156
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:09,459
If you would clarify, minister? To what
disadvantage are you referring?

157
00:19:09,754 --> 00:19:11,972
Your Human mother.

158
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:19,271
Council, ministers, I must decline.

159
00:19:19,272 --> 00:19:21,961
No Vulcan has ever declined
admission to this Academy.

160
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:24,828
But as I am half-human, your
record remains untarnished.

161
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:28,605
Spock, you have made a commitment
to honor the Vulcan way.

162
00:19:28,606 --> 00:19:30,747
Why did you come before this
council today?

163
00:19:30,748 --> 00:19:33,582
Was it to satisfy your emotional need
to rebel?

164
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,415
The only emotion I wish to convey
is gratitude.

165
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,796
Thank you, ministers,
for your consideration.

166
00:19:43,286 --> 00:19:45,513
Live long and prosper.

167
00:20:08,645 --> 00:20:09,658
- Hi.
- Hey there.

168
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:18,887
Hi. I'd like a Clabmin fire tea ...
3 Budweiser Classics,

169
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:22,239
2 Cardassian sunrises and ...

170
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:24,840
- Try the Slusho, it's good.
- A Slusho mix, thank you.

171
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,771
That's a lot of drinks for a woman.

172
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:32,080
- And a shot of Jack, straight up.
- Make that two. Her shot's on me.

173
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:34,495
Her shot's on her.
Thanks, but no thanks.

174
00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:37,740
Don't you at least wanna know my name
before you completely reject me?

175
00:20:37,741 --> 00:20:39,110
I'm fine without it.

176
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,506
You are fine without it. It's Jim, Jim Kirk.

177
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:48,059
If you don't tell me your name,
I'm gonna have to make one up.

178
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,268
- It's Uhura.
- Uhura? No way.

179
00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:53,502
That's the name I was gonna make
up for you.

180
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:56,260
- Uhura what?
- Just Uhura.

181
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:59,336
- They don't have last names in your world?
- Uhura is my last name.

182
00:20:59,337 --> 00:21:02,243
Well then you have ... your first name's Human?

183
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:08,625
- Excuse me buddy. - So, you're a cadet,
your studying. What's your focus?

184
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:11,101
Xenolinguistics.
You have no idea what that means.

185
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:15,711
The study of alien languages.
Morphology, phonology, syntax.

186
00:21:16,455 --> 00:21:18,486
Means you've got a talented tongue.

187
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:21,371
I'm impressed.

188
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:23,494
For a moment there, I thought you were just
a dumb-hair colonial

189
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:25,505
who has sex with farm animals.

190
00:21:25,506 --> 00:21:28,429
Well, not only.

191
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:31,513
This townie isn't bothering you, right?

192
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:34,517
Oh, beyond belief.
But it's nothing I can't handle.

193
00:21:34,518 --> 00:21:36,638
You could've handled me.
That's an invitation.

194
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:41,200
- Hey. You better mind your manners.
- Oh relax cupcake, it was a joke.

195
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,938
Hey farm boy, maybe you can't count.

196
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:45,907
There are 4 of us and 1 of you.

197
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:49,296
So get some more guys and then it'll
be an even fight.

198
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:54,658
Guys. Stop it.

199
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,464
Stop it!

200
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:21,001
Enough!

201
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:30,272
Guys, he's had enough.

202
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:37,727
Outside. All of you.

203
00:22:38,194 --> 00:22:40,025
- Now.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:42,199
- What ...
- I just bought a drink.

205
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:49,136
- You all right, son?
- You can whistle really loud, you know that?

206
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:53,196
You know I couldn't believe it when the
bartender told me who you are.

207
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:56,169
- Who the hell am I, captain Pike?
- Your father's son.

208
00:22:59,492 --> 00:23:01,355
Can I get another one?

209
00:23:01,356 --> 00:23:03,902
For my dissertation I was assigned USS Kelvin.

210
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:07,729
Something I admired about your dad, he didn't
believe in no-win scenarios.

211
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:11,616
- Sure learned his lesson.
- Well that depends on how you define winning.

212
00:23:11,617 --> 00:23:13,484
You're here, aren't you?
- Thanks.

213
00:23:13,985 --> 00:23:17,031
You know that instinct to leap without looking,
that was his nature too

214
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:19,363
and in my opinion something Starfleet's lost.

215
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,394
Why are you talking to me man?

216
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:24,335
Because I looked up your file while
you were drooling on the floor.

217
00:23:25,268 --> 00:23:28,053
Your aptitude tests are off the charts, so
what is it?

218
00:23:29,102 --> 00:23:32,096
You like being the only genius level
repeat-offender in the mid-west?

219
00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:33,613
Maybe I love it.

220
00:23:33,614 --> 00:23:36,780
So your dad dies, you can saddle for
less than an ordinary life.

221
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,356
Or do you feel that you were meant for
something better? Something special?

222
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:47,390
- Enlist in Starfleet.
- Enlist?

223
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,651
You guys must be way down on your
recruiting quarter for the month.

224
00:23:51,652 --> 00:23:53,579
If you're half the man your father was
Jim,

225
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,571
Starfleet could use you.

226
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:59,501
You can be an officer in 4 years,
you can have your own ship in 8.

227
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:04,645
You understand what the Federation is,
don't you? It's important,

228
00:24:04,646 --> 00:24:06,657
It's a peacekeeping and humanitarian
armada.

229
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:08,804
We done?

230
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:11,075
I'm done.

231
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:18,441
Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new
recruits leaves tomorrow - 08:00.

232
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:25,922
Your father was captain of a starship
for 12 minutes.

233
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:31,723
He saved 800 lives, including your
mother's and yours.

234
00:24:32,894 --> 00:24:35,482
I dare you to do better.

235
00:25:59,998 --> 00:26:01,527
Nice ride man.

236
00:26:04,984 --> 00:26:06,899
It's yours.

237
00:26:07,154 --> 00:26:10,259
4 years? I'll do it in 3.

238
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:28,274
At ease gentlemen.

239
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:48,328
Never did get that first name.

240
00:26:48,716 --> 00:26:50,109
- You need a doctor.
- I told you people,

241
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,099
I don't need a doctor,
damn it. I am a doctor.

242
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:54,727
- You need to get back to your seat.
- I had one, in the bathroom with no windows.

243
00:26:54,728 --> 00:26:58,104
I suffer from aviofobia. That means fear
of dying in something that flies.

244
00:26:58,105 --> 00:27:00,994
Sir, for your own safety, sit down or
else I'll make you sit down!

245
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,741
- Fine.
- Thank you.

246
00:27:07,107 --> 00:27:09,145
This is captain Pike, we've been cleared
for takeoff.

247
00:27:10,398 --> 00:27:12,688
I may throw up on you.

248
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:16,077
- I think these things are pretty safe.
- Don't pander with me kid.

249
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:19,578
One tiny crack in the hull and our blood
boils in 13 seconds.

250
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:22,191
A solar flare might crop up,
cook us in our seats.

251
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:25,512
And while you’re sitting pretty with a case
of Andorian shingles,

252
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:28,660
see if you're still so relaxed when your
eyeballs are bleeding.

253
00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:32,869
Space is disease and danger, wrapped
in darkness and silence.

254
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,276
Well I hate to break this to you, but
Starfleet operates in space.

255
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:41,531
Yeah, well... I've got nowhere else to go, the ex
wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce.

256
00:27:42,144 --> 00:27:44,482
All I've got left is my bones.

257
00:27:49,671 --> 00:27:54,072
- Jim Kirk.
- McCoy. Leonard McCoy.

258
00:28:13,244 --> 00:28:16,938
Three years later.

259
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:44,353
Captain Nero. You've been
requested on the bridge, sir.

260
00:28:44,354 --> 00:28:46,965
Ayel says it's time.

261
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,784
Sir, we've arrived at the
coordinates we calculated.

262
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,227
There's nothing here. What
are your orders?

263
00:28:58,242 --> 00:28:59,950
We wait.

264
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:03,135
We wait for the one who allowed
our home to be destroyed.

265
00:29:03,988 --> 00:29:06,509
As we've been doing for 25 years.

266
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:10,132
- And once we've killed him?
- Kill him?

267
00:29:10,455 --> 00:29:14,316
I'm not gonna kill him.
I gonna make him watch.

268
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,332
Capture that ship.

269
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:33,701
Welcome back, Spock.

270
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:39,844
- Why are you so happy?
- I do not know what you're talking about.

271
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:42,384
- No, I don't suppose you do.
- Hello ladies.

272
00:29:43,162 --> 00:29:45,000
- I'm taking the test again.
- You've got to be kidding.

273
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:46,950
Yeah, tomorrow morning.
And I want you there.

274
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:50,277
You know I've got better things to do than
watch you embarrass yourself for the 3rd time.

275
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:51,681
I am a doctor, Jim. I'm busy.

276
00:29:51,716 --> 00:29:54,085
Bones, it doesn't bother you that no one’s
ever passed the test.

277
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,997
Jim, it's Kobayashi Maru.
Nobody passes the test.

278
00:29:56,998 --> 00:29:59,435
And no one goes back for seconds,
let alone thirds.

279
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:01,865
I've gotta study.

280
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:04,103
Study, my ass.

281
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,737
Jim, I think I love you.

282
00:30:10,748 --> 00:30:13,147
- That is so weird.
- Lights.

283
00:30:14,743 --> 00:30:17,225
- Did you just say that is so weird.
- Yeah, I did, but I ...

284
00:30:17,226 --> 00:30:19,065
You don't love me too?

285
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:21,388
- Oh, no, my roommate.
- I thought you said she was gone for the night.

286
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:23,402
Obviously she's not. Quick, you've got ...
just get under the bed.

287
00:30:23,403 --> 00:30:26,879
- Under ... ? - Look, just get under
the bed. She can't see you.

288
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,710
- Why not? - Because I promised her
I'd stop bringing guys back to the dorm.

289
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:31,862
- Well how... How many guys have you ...?
- Just d... just down.

290
00:30:34,444 --> 00:30:36,337
- Hey.
- Hey. How are you?

291
00:30:36,338 --> 00:30:38,732
- Good. - Strangest thing...

292
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:40,502
I was in the long range sensor lab.

293
00:30:40,503 --> 00:30:42,361
Yeah, I thought all night...

294
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:46,919
I was tracking solar systems and I picked
up an emergency transmission.

295
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,788
- Really?
- Yeah.

296
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:50,811
From a Klingon prison planet.

297
00:30:50,812 --> 00:30:52,043
- No.
- Yeah.

298
00:30:52,078 --> 00:30:54,850
A Klingon armada was destroyed,
47 ships.

299
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:57,656
So, you're not going back to the
lab tonight?

300
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:03,588
- Gaila, who is he?
- Who's who?

301
00:31:03,589 --> 00:31:05,616
The mouth-breather hiding under
your bed.

302
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:08,279
- You could hear me breathing?
- You.

303
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,461
- Big day tomorrow.
- You're gonna fail.

304
00:31:10,462 --> 00:31:12,129
- Gail, see you around.
- Get out.

305
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,541
- If I pass will you tell me your first name?
- No. Good night.

306
00:31:14,543 --> 00:31:18,454
I think the fact that you picked up
a transmission is very impress...

307
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:23,209
We're receiving a distress signal from
the USS Kobayashi Maru.

308
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,428
The ship has lost power and is
stranded.

309
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:27,505
Starfleet command has ordered
us to rescue them.

310
00:31:27,506 --> 00:31:32,622
Starfleet command has ordered
us to rescue them ... captain.

311
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:37,015
Two Klingon vessels have entered the neutral
zone and are locking weapons on us.

312
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:39,941
- That's OK.
- That's OK?

313
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:41,693
Yeah, don't worry about it.

314
00:31:41,694 --> 00:31:46,102
- Did he say don't worry about it?
- Is he not taking the simulation seriously?

315
00:31:46,103 --> 00:31:49,049
Three more Klingon war birds decloaking
and targeting our ship.

316
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:51,852
- I don't suppose this is a problem either?
- They're firing, captain.

317
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:53,953
Alert medical bay to prepare to receive

318
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,849
all crew members from the damaged ship

319
00:31:56,136 --> 00:32:00,681
And how do you expect us to rescue them
when we're surrounded by Klingons, captain?

320
00:32:00,716 --> 00:32:03,067
Alert medical.

321
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:08,123
- Our ship is being hit. Shields at 60%.
- I understand.

322
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,640
Should we, I don't know, fight back?

323
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:13,522
- No.
- Of course not.

324
00:32:20,414 --> 00:32:22,274
What is this? What's going on?

325
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:28,445
Hm. Arm photons. Prepare to fire
on the Klingon war birds.

326
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,714
- Yes, sir.
- Jim, their shields are still up.

327
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,073
Are they?

328
00:32:33,945 --> 00:32:37,714
- No, they're not.
- Fire on all enemy ships.

329
00:32:37,715 --> 00:32:40,287
One photon each should do
let's not waste ammunition.

330
00:32:40,287 --> 00:32:42,402
Target locked an acquired on all war birds.

331
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,186
Firing.

332
00:32:48,331 --> 00:32:49,683
All ships destroyed, captain.

333
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:51,029
Begin rescue of the stranded crew.

334
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,304
So, we've managed to eliminate all
enemy ships,

335
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,250
no one on board was injured,

336
00:32:56,251 --> 00:33:01,924
and the successful rescue of the
Kobayashi Maru crew is under way.

337
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:08,872
How the hell did that kid beat your test?

338
00:33:11,621 --> 00:33:14,083
I do not know.

339
00:33:14,431 --> 00:33:17,371
This session has been called to resolve a
troubling matter.

340
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:20,049
James T. Kirk, step forward.

341
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,688
Cadet Kirk, evidence has been submitted
to this council,

342
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:27,612
suggesting that you violated the
ethical code of conduct

343
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:31,099
pursuing to regulation 17.43
of the Starfleet code.

344
00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:34,487
Is there anything you care to say
before we begin, sir?

345
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:40,134
Yes. I believe I have the right
to face my accuser directly?

346
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:45,624
Step forward please.

347
00:33:46,497 --> 00:33:50,401
This is commander Spock. He is one
of our most distinguished graduates.

348
00:33:50,734 --> 00:33:54,318
He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru
exam for the last 4 years.

349
00:33:56,441 --> 00:33:57,612
Commander.

350
00:33:58,187 --> 00:34:01,188
Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed to install
and activate a subroutine

351
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:04,066
in the programming code, thereby changing the
conditions of the test.

352
00:34:05,622 --> 00:34:08,733
- Your point being?
- In academic vernacular - you cheated.

353
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:14,718
Let me ask you something I think we all
know the answer to.

354
00:34:15,476 --> 00:34:19,550
The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?
You programmed it to be unwinnable.

355
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:22,509
Your argument precludes the ability
of a no-win scenario?

356
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,805
I don't believe in no-win scenarios.

357
00:34:24,806 --> 00:34:28,378
Then not only did you violate the rules, you
also failed to understand the principle lesson.

358
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:29,769
Please, enlighten me.

359
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:34,201
You of all people should know, cadet
Kirk, a captain cannot cheat death.

360
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:39,808
- I of all people?
- Your father,

361
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:43,848
lt. George Kirk assumed command of his vessel
before being killed in action, did he not?

362
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:48,286
- I don't think you like the fact that I beat your test.
- Further more you have failed to define the purpose of the test

363
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:51,247
- Enlighten me again.
- The purpose to experience fear.

364
00:34:52,472 --> 00:34:55,911
Fear in the face of certain death.
To accept that fear

365
00:34:55,913 --> 00:34:58,473
and maintain control of oneself
and one's crew.

366
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:01,871
This is a quality expected in
every Starfleet captain.

367
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,382
Excuse me, sir.

368
00:35:12,919 --> 00:35:15,193
We've received a distress
call from Vulcan.

369
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:18,472
With our primary fleet engaged
in the Laurentian system,

370
00:35:18,472 --> 00:35:22,135
I hereby order all cadets to report
to hangar 1 immediately.

371
00:35:22,136 --> 00:35:23,137
Dismissed.

372
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:32,413
- Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
- I do not know.

373
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:34,408
But I like him.

374
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:41,261
Bracer, USS Farragut.

375
00:35:41,423 --> 00:35:44,773
McCoy, USS Enterprise.
McGrath, USS Walcott.

376
00:35:44,774 --> 00:35:46,239
Spader, USS Hood.

377
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,961
Welcome to Starfleet.
Godspeed.

378
00:35:50,388 --> 00:35:52,480
He didn't call my name.

379
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:57,822
Commander, sir, you didn't call
my name, Kirk, James T.

380
00:35:58,015 --> 00:36:00,922
Kirk, you're on academic suspension,
that means you're grounded

381
00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:03,164
until the academy board rules.

382
00:36:06,227 --> 00:36:08,732
Jim, the board will rule in your favor.

383
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,745
Most likely.

384
00:36:12,258 --> 00:36:14,667
Look Jim, I've gotta go.

385
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:17,739
Yeah. Yeah, go. Be safe.

386
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:27,785
- Excuse me.
- Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

387
00:36:32,543 --> 00:36:34,022
Damn it.

388
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:37,989
Come with me.

389
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:41,561
Uhura, USS Farragut.
Petrovsky, USS Antares.

390
00:36:41,562 --> 00:36:43,617
Go to your stations and good luck.

391
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:50,296
- Bones, where are we going?
- You'll see.

392
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:53,675
- Commander, a word?
- Yes, lieutenant?

393
00:36:53,676 --> 00:36:55,986
- Was I not one of your top students?
- Indeed you were.

394
00:36:56,021 --> 00:37:00,276
And did I not on multiple occasions
demonstrate an exceptional oral sensitivity

395
00:37:00,277 --> 00:37:03,976
and I quote "an unparalleled ability
to identify sonic anomalies

396
00:37:03,977 --> 00:37:05,754
in subspace transmission tests"?

397
00:37:05,755 --> 00:37:07,341
Consistently, yes.

398
00:37:07,342 --> 00:37:10,841
And while you were well aware that I'm qualified
and desire to serve on the USS Enterprise,

399
00:37:10,842 --> 00:37:12,829
I'm assigned to the Farragut?

400
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,019
It was an attempt to avoid
the appearance of favoritism.

401
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,189
No. I'm assigned to the Enterprise.

402
00:37:22,418 --> 00:37:24,453
- Yes, I believe you are.
- Thank you.

403
00:37:25,696 --> 00:37:27,946
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing you a favor.

404
00:37:27,947 --> 00:37:30,877
I couldn’t just leave you there
looking all pathetic. Take a seat.

405
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,854
Let me give you a vaccine
against viral infection

406
00:37:32,855 --> 00:37:34,473
from the Ovaran mud flies.

407
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:38,060
- What for?
- To give you the symptoms.

408
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:41,322
- What are you talking about? - You're
gonna start to lose vision in your left eye.

409
00:37:41,323 --> 00:37:42,820
Yeah, I already have.

410
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:45,464
Oh, and you're gonna get a really bad
headache and flop sweat.

411
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,411
- You call this a favor?
- Yeah, you owe me one.

412
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:54,866
Kirk, James T. He is not cleared
for duty aboard the Enterprise.

413
00:37:54,979 --> 00:37:57,901
Medical code states the treatment and
transport of a patient is to be determined

414
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:00,791
at the discretion of his attending physician.

415
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:03,609
Which is me. S I'm taking Mr. Kirk aboard.

416
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,230
Or you would you like to explain to
captain Pike

417
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:10,388
why Enterprise warped into a crisis
without one of its senior medical officers?

418
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:13,917
- As you were.
- As you were. Come on.

419
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,564
I might throw up on you.

420
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:36,436
Jim, you've gotta look at this.

421
00:38:36,822 --> 00:38:39,043
- Jim, look.
- What?

422
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,943
We need to get you changed.

423
00:39:38,163 --> 00:39:40,163
I don't feel right. I feel like I'm leaking.

424
00:39:40,164 --> 00:39:42,312
Damn, it's that pointy-eared bastard.

425
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,389
- Mr. Spock.
- Captain.

426
00:40:02,813 --> 00:40:05,710
- Engineering reports ready for launch.
- Thank you.

427
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:08,271
Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden
voyage of our newest flagship

428
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:11,046
deserves more pompon circumstance
that we can afford today.

429
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:14,518
The christening will just have to
be our reward for a safe return.

430
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:16,177
Carry on.

431
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:18,972
All decks, this is Captain Pike.
Prepare for immediate departure.

432
00:40:18,973 --> 00:40:20,355
Helm, thrusters.

433
00:40:20,356 --> 00:40:22,803
??? retracted, captain, dock
control reports ready.

434
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,488
Thrusters fired.
Separating from space dock.

435
00:40:34,843 --> 00:40:37,745
The fleet's cleared space dock, captain.
All ships ready for warp.

436
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,283
- Set course for Vulcan.
- Aye-aye, captain.

437
00:40:41,433 --> 00:40:43,020
Course laid in.

438
00:40:43,644 --> 00:40:45,844
Maximum warp. Punch it.

439
00:41:03,018 --> 00:41:06,048
- Lieutenant, where's helmsmen McKenna?
- He has lung worms sir.

440
00:41:06,049 --> 00:41:07,957
He couldn't report to his post.

441
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:11,163
- I'm Hikaru Sulu.
- And you are a pilot, right?

442
00:41:11,704 --> 00:41:16,174
Very much so, sir. I'm ...
I'm not sure what's wrong here.

443
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:18,034
Is the parking brake on?

444
00:41:18,452 --> 00:41:19,585
No.

445
00:41:19,586 --> 00:41:20,568
I figured it out, I'm just...

446
00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:22,833
Have you disengaged the external
inertial dampener?

447
00:41:27,913 --> 00:41:30,253
- Ready for warp, sir.
- Let's punch it.

448
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:39,236
- Where are we?
- Medical bay.

449
00:41:39,237 --> 00:41:41,329
- This isn't worth it.
- A little suffering's good for the soul.

450
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:42,329
Hi, how are you?

451
00:41:43,098 --> 00:41:46,650
- My mouth is itchy. Is that normal?
- Well, those symptoms won't last long.

452
00:41:46,651 --> 00:41:49,804
- I'm going to give you a mild sedative.
- Oh, I wish I didn't know you.

453
00:41:49,805 --> 00:41:50,806
Don't be such an infant.

454
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,766
How long is it supposed to...

455
00:41:55,217 --> 00:41:56,825
Unbelievable.

456
00:41:58,105 --> 00:41:59,359
Engines at maximum warp captain.

457
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,631
Russian whiz kid, what's your name?
Cheikov? Chirpov?

458
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:04,978
- Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andrejevic, sir.
- Fine.

459
00:42:05,012 --> 00:42:07,767
Chekov, Pavel Andrejevic,
begin ship wide mission broadcast.

460
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,774
Yes, sir. Happy to.

461
00:42:10,472 --> 00:42:14,367
Ensign authorization code
95 Wictor Wictor 2.

462
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:16,457
Authorization not recognized.

463
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:22,930
Ensign authorization code
95 Victor Victor 2.

464
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:25,466
Access granted.

465
00:42:25,467 --> 00:42:27,974
May I have your attention please.

466
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:33,993
At 22:00, telemetry detected an anomaly
in the neutral zone.

467
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:37,755
What appeared to be a lightning
storm in space.

468
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:42,650
Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
signal from the Vulcan high command

469
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:46,537
that their planet was experiencing
seismic activity.

470
00:42:46,538 --> 00:42:50,481
Our mission is to assess the
condition of Vulcan

471
00:42:50,482 --> 00:42:54,022
and assist in evacuations
if necessary.

472
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:59,303
We should be arriving at Vulcan within
3 minutes. Thank you for your time.

473
00:43:00,743 --> 00:43:02,638
Lightning storm.

474
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:05,425
Aah Jim, you're awake. How do you feel?

475
00:43:06,745 --> 00:43:09,005
- Good God, man!
- What? Aah!

476
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:14,223
- What the hell's this?
- A reaction to the vaccine. Damn it.

477
00:43:14,493 --> 00:43:17,049
Nurse Chapel, I need 50cc
of cortisone.

478
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,051
Yes, sir.

479
00:43:20,677 --> 00:43:23,924
May I ... Appeared to be
a lightning storm in space.

480
00:43:25,065 --> 00:43:26,456
We've gotta stop the ship.

481
00:43:26,457 --> 00:43:28,979
Jim. I'm not kidding. You need
to keep your heart rate down.

482
00:43:30,268 --> 00:43:31,932
Computer, locate crew member Uhura.

483
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:34,211
I haven't seen a reaction this
severe since medical school.

484
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:37,194
- We're flying into a trap!
- Damn it, Jim! Stand still.

485
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,421
Stop it!

486
00:43:48,886 --> 00:43:51,223
- Uhura.
- Kirk. What are you doing here?

487
00:43:51,224 --> 00:43:53,376
Transmission from the Klingon prison
planet, what exactly did it say?

488
00:43:53,377 --> 00:43:57,654
- Oh my God, what's wrong with your hands?
- Who is responsible for the Klingon attack?

489
00:43:57,688 --> 00:43:59,563
- Was the ship Romu...?
- Was the ship what?

490
00:44:00,246 --> 00:44:02,172
- What's happening to my mouth?
- You got numb tongue?

491
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:04,395
- Numb tongue?!
- I can fix that.

492
00:44:04,396 --> 00:44:07,977
- Was the ship what?
- Romulan.

493
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,425
- What?
- Romulan.

494
00:44:09,426 --> 00:44:10,426
- Romulan? - Yeah.
- Yes. - Yeah!

495
00:44:45,566 --> 00:44:49,090
Prod Nero seven Federation
ships are on their way.

496
00:44:51,223 --> 00:44:52,426
- Jim!
- What's going on?

497
00:44:52,427 --> 00:44:54,205
- Jim, come back.
- Captain!

498
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,130
Captain Pike, sir, we have to stop the ship.

499
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:58,667
Kirk, how the hell did you get
on board the Enterprise?

500
00:44:58,668 --> 00:45:01,979
- Captain, this man is under the influence of a
severe reaction to a vaccine. - Bones, plea...

501
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:03,162
... He's completely delusional ...

502
00:45:03,163 --> 00:45:06,775
Vulcan is not a experiencing a natural disaster,
it's being attacked by Romulans.

503
00:45:06,776 --> 00:45:10,102
Romulans? Cadet Kirk, I think you've
had enough attention for one day

504
00:45:10,103 --> 00:45:12,716
McCoy, take him back to medical.
We'll have words later.

505
00:45:12,717 --> 00:45:14,546
- Aye captain.
- Sir, that same anomaly ...

506
00:45:14,547 --> 00:45:16,608
Mr. Kirk is not cleared to be
aboard this vessel, captain...

507
00:45:16,643 --> 00:45:17,974
Look, I get it, you're a great ...

508
00:45:17,975 --> 00:45:19,602
I'd love to do it again with you soon ...

509
00:45:19,637 --> 00:45:21,193
- I can remove the cadet ...
- Try it!

510
00:45:21,194 --> 00:45:22,871
This cadet is trying to save the bridge!

511
00:45:22,872 --> 00:45:25,822
By recommending a full stop mid-warp
doing a rescue mission?

512
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,588
It's not a rescue mission.
Listen to me. It's an attack.

513
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:29,772
Based on what facts?

514
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:34,301
That same anomaly,
a lightning storm in space

515
00:45:34,302 --> 00:45:36,320
that we saw today, also occurred
on the day of my birth.

516
00:45:36,321 --> 00:45:39,297
Before a Romulan ship attacked
the USS Kelvin.

517
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:41,494
You know that, sir.
I've read your dissertation.

518
00:45:41,495 --> 00:45:44,064
That ship, which had formidable and
advanced weaponry

519
00:45:44,065 --> 00:45:45,895
was never seen or heard from again.

520
00:45:45,896 --> 00:45:47,967
The Kelvin attacked a place on
the edge of Klingon space.

521
00:45:47,968 --> 00:45:50,676
And at 23:00 last night
there was an attack.

522
00:45:50,677 --> 00:45:54,535
47 Klingon war birds destroyed
by Romulans, sir.

523
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:57,728
And it was reported that the Romulans
were in one ship, one massive ship.

524
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:00,274
And you know of this Klingon attack how?

525
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,951
Sir, I intercepted and translated
the message myself.

526
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,267
- Kirk's report is accurate.
- We're warping into a trap, sir.

527
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:11,848
The Romulans are waiting for us.
I promise you that.

528
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:15,130
The cadet's logic is sound.

529
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:19,698
And lt. Uhura's is unmatched in xenolinguistics.
We would be wise to accept her conclusion.

530
00:46:19,699 --> 00:46:22,753
Scan Vulcan space. Check for
any transmissions in Romulan.

531
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:25,954
Sir, I'm not sure I can distinguish the
Romulan language from Vulcan.

532
00:46:26,302 --> 00:46:28,286
What about you?
Do you speak Romulan, cadet?

533
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:29,987
Uhura. All 3 dialects, sir.

534
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:33,214
- Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

535
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:34,735
Hannity, hail the USS Truman.

536
00:46:34,736 --> 00:46:37,427
All the other ships are out of warp
sir and have arrived at Vulcan,

537
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:39,634
but we seem to have lost all contact.

538
00:46:39,635 --> 00:46:44,248
Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission
or transmission of any kind in the area.

539
00:46:44,249 --> 00:46:46,670
It's because they're being attacked.

540
00:46:50,896 --> 00:46:52,561
Shields up. Red alert.

541
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:57,289
Arrival at Vulcan
in 5 seconds.

542
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,753
4 ... 3 .... 2 ...

543
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:04,326
- Emergency evasives.
- Running, sir.

544
00:47:12,273 --> 00:47:13,914
- Damage report.
- Deflector shields are holding.

545
00:47:13,915 --> 00:47:16,143
All stations.
Engineering, Olson, report.

546
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:27,866
Full reverse. Come about starboard, 90°.

547
00:47:27,866 --> 00:47:29,478
Drop us down underneath them, Sulu.

548
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:51,901
- Sir, there's another Federation ship.
- Destroy it too.

549
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:52,932
Fire torpedoes.

550
00:47:52,933 --> 00:47:54,177
Captain, they're locking torpedoes.

551
00:47:54,178 --> 00:47:57,015
Divert auxiliary power from port
nossel to forward shields.

552
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:07,147
- Sulu, status report.
- Shields at 32%.

553
00:48:07,148 --> 00:48:09,514
Their weapons are powerful, sir.
We can't take another hit like that.

554
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:11,261
- Get me Starfleet command.
- Captain.

555
00:48:11,262 --> 00:48:14,134
The Romulan ship has lowered some
kind of high energy pulse device

556
00:48:14,135 --> 00:48:15,344
into the Vulcan atmosphere.

557
00:48:15,345 --> 00:48:18,243
It's signal appears to be blocking our
communications and transporter abilities.

558
00:48:18,244 --> 00:48:20,453
All power to forward shields.
Prepare to fire all weapons.

559
00:48:25,123 --> 00:48:26,289
Weapons ready.

560
00:48:26,748 --> 00:48:27,689
Wait!

561
00:48:28,221 --> 00:48:31,092
- Gohol, magnify!
- Yes, sir.

562
00:48:35,726 --> 00:48:37,587
Captain, we're being hailed.

563
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,157
Hello.

564
00:48:41,992 --> 00:48:44,243
I am the captain Christopher Pike.
To whom am I speaking?

565
00:48:44,919 --> 00:48:46,542
Hi Christopher. I am Nero.

566
00:48:47,223 --> 00:48:49,826
You've declared war against the Federation.
Withdraw

567
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:53,109
and I'll agree to arrange a conference with
Romulan leadership at a neutral location.

568
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:57,256
I do not speak for the Empire.
We stand apart.

569
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,258
As does your Vulcan crew member.
Isn't that right, Spock?

570
00:49:05,105 --> 00:49:07,847
Pardon me, I do not believe that
you and I are acquainted.

571
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:09,425
No, we're not.

572
00:49:09,701 --> 00:49:11,114
Not yet.

573
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:14,663
Spock, there's something I
would like you to see.

574
00:49:16,325 --> 00:49:20,197
Captain Pike, your transporter
has been disabled.

575
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:24,085
As you can see, by the rest of
the armada, you have no choice.

576
00:49:24,924 --> 00:49:28,960
You will man a shuttle. Come aboard
the Narada for negotiations.

577
00:49:29,712 --> 00:49:31,543
That is all.

578
00:49:40,307 --> 00:49:42,298
- They’ll kill you, you know that.
- Your survival is unlikely.

579
00:49:42,299 --> 00:49:43,909
Captain, we gain nothing
by diplomacy.

580
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,310
Going over to that ship is a mistake.

581
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:48,347
- I too agree. You should rethink your strategy.
- I understand that.

582
00:49:49,502 --> 00:49:52,416
I need officers who've been trained in
advanced hand to hand combat.

583
00:49:52,959 --> 00:49:54,782
I have training, sir.

584
00:49:55,448 --> 00:49:57,210
Come with me.

585
00:49:57,211 --> 00:49:59,342
Kirk, you too. You're not supposed
to be here anyway.

586
00:49:59,707 --> 00:50:02,300
- Chekov, you have the con.
- Aye, Captain.

587
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,006
Prepare the red matter.

588
00:50:26,953 --> 00:50:29,026
Yes, sir.

589
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,775
Without transporters we can't beam off the ship.

590
00:51:08,776 --> 00:51:10,822
We can't assist Vulcan.
We can't do our job.

591
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:15,764
Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and engineer Olson
will space-jump from the shuttle.

592
00:51:16,228 --> 00:51:18,988
You will land on that machine
they've lowered into the atmosphere

593
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:22,181
that's scrambling our gear. You'll get
inside, you'll disable it

594
00:51:22,182 --> 00:51:23,851
then you'll beam back to the ship.

595
00:51:23,851 --> 00:51:26,817
Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in
command of the Enterprise.

596
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,944
Once we have transport capability
and communication back up

597
00:51:29,945 --> 00:51:32,601
you'll contact Starfleet and report
what the hell's going on here.

598
00:51:32,929 --> 00:51:34,941
And if all else fails, fall back

599
00:51:34,942 --> 00:51:37,003
and rendezvous with the fleet
in the Laurentian system.

600
00:51:37,004 --> 00:51:38,616
Kirk, I'm promoting you to first officer.

601
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:39,842
- What?
- Captain?

602
00:51:39,843 --> 00:51:43,111
Please, I apologize. The complexities
of Human pranks escape me.

603
00:51:43,112 --> 00:51:45,196
It's not a prank, Spock.

604
00:51:45,197 --> 00:51:47,978
And I am not the captain, you are.

605
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,357
Let's go.

606
00:51:52,865 --> 00:51:55,614
Sir, after we knock out that drill,
what happens to you?

607
00:51:55,615 --> 00:51:56,966
I guess you have to come and get me.

608
00:51:57,873 --> 00:52:00,486
Careful with the ship, Spock.
She's brand new.

609
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:14,207
- Dr. Puri, report.
- It's McCoy.

610
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:16,903
Doctor Puri was on deck 6.
He's dead.

611
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:21,075
Then you have just inherited his
responsibility as chief medical officer.

612
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:23,292
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

613
00:52:27,092 --> 00:52:30,883
Shuttle 89, USS Enterprise, you are clear ...

614
00:52:33,158 --> 00:52:34,873
- You've got the charges, right?
- Oh yeah.

615
00:52:35,179 --> 00:52:37,650
Can't wait to kick some Romulan ass.

616
00:52:38,169 --> 00:52:40,484
- Yeah.
- Oh yeah.

617
00:52:59,683 --> 00:53:01,539
So what kind of combat training do you have?

618
00:53:01,738 --> 00:53:03,799
Fencing.

619
00:53:06,294 --> 00:53:07,647
Pre-jump.

620
00:53:11,834 --> 00:53:15,329
Shuttle commander, you are clear
from USS Enterprise ...

621
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:23,914
Gentlemen, we're approaching the drop zone.

622
00:53:24,078 --> 00:53:26,915
You have one shot
to land on that platform.

623
00:53:27,072 --> 00:53:29,899
They may have defenses, so pull your chute
as late as possible.

624
00:53:30,431 --> 00:53:33,749
3 ... 2 ... 1.

625
00:53:35,082 --> 00:53:38,965
Remember, the Enterprise won't be able to
beam you back until you've turned off that drill.

626
00:53:41,104 --> 00:53:42,386
Good luck.

627
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:06,255
Away team is entering the atmosphere, sir.

628
00:54:06,556 --> 00:54:08,170
20 000 m.

629
00:54:32,617 --> 00:54:34,966
Approaching the platform
at 5 800 m.

630
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:38,745
Kirk to Enterprise.
Distance to target 5 000 m.

631
00:54:41,596 --> 00:54:43,598
4 600 m from the platform.

632
00:54:43,657 --> 00:54:44,959
4 100 m to target.

633
00:54:47,092 --> 00:54:48,431
4 000 m.

634
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:50,954
3 000 m.

635
00:54:51,035 --> 00:54:53,370
2 000 m.
Pull the chute.

636
00:54:58,736 --> 00:55:02,390
- 2 000 m.
- Pull your chute, Olson.

637
00:55:02,391 --> 00:55:04,258
No, not yet. Not yet.

638
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,140
- 1 500 m.
- Open the chute!

639
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:10,309
- Olson, pull your chute!
- 1 000 m.

640
00:55:23,172 --> 00:55:24,859
Olson!

641
00:55:24,978 --> 00:55:27,258
Olson is gone, sir.

642
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,617
Kirk has landed, sir.

643
00:57:52,712 --> 00:57:54,087
Gimme your hand.

644
00:58:01,495 --> 00:58:03,486
Olson had the charges.

645
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:06,176
I know.

646
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,167
- What do we do?
- This.

647
00:58:22,573 --> 00:58:25,933
The jamming signal's gone. Transport
abilities are reestablished.

648
00:58:26,094 --> 00:58:28,065
Transporter control is reengaged sir.

649
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:31,094
Check all gravitational sensors. I wanna
know what they were doing to the planet.

650
00:58:31,095 --> 00:58:33,695
Aye, Commander. Captain. Sorry, captain.

651
00:58:38,497 --> 00:58:41,671
The drill's been sabotaged sir but
we have reached the planet's core.

652
00:58:42,013 --> 00:58:44,094
Launch red matter.

653
00:58:58,046 --> 00:59:02,892
Kirk to Enterprise. They just launched something
at the planet through the hole they just drilled.

654
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:05,552
- Do you copy Enterprise?
- Yes, sir.

655
00:59:06,956 --> 00:59:09,865
Captain, gravitational sensors
are off the scale.

656
00:59:09,866 --> 00:59:13,853
If my calculations are correct,
they're creating a singularity

657
00:59:14,734 --> 00:59:17,812
... that will consume the planet.

658
00:59:19,684 --> 00:59:22,923
They're creating a black hole
at the center of Vulcan?

659
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:24,676
Yes.

660
00:59:24,677 --> 00:59:26,333
How long does the planet have?

661
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:29,982
Minutes, sir. Minutes.

662
00:59:31,198 --> 00:59:33,669
Alert Vulcan command center to
signal a planet wide evacuation

663
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,907
all channels, all frequencies.
-Wait. - Maintain standard orbit.

664
00:59:35,907 --> 00:59:36,908
Yes, sir.

665
00:59:36,909 --> 00:59:37,818
Where are you going?

666
00:59:37,819 --> 00:59:41,082
To evacuate the Vulcan High Council.
Their task is to protect our cultural history,

667
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:43,197
- My parents will be among them.
- Can't you beam them out?

668
00:59:43,198 --> 00:59:45,283
That is impossible. They will
be in the Katric ark.

669
00:59:45,767 --> 00:59:47,440
I must get them myself.

670
00:59:47,441 --> 00:59:50,284
- Chekov, you have the con.
- Aye.

671
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,922
Kirk to Enterprise.
Beam us out of here.

672
00:59:55,923 --> 00:59:57,452
Stand by, locking on your signal.

673
00:59:58,241 --> 01:00:00,534
- Retract the drill. Let's move out
- Yes, sir.

674
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:02,122
Fold up.

675
01:00:04,828 --> 01:00:07,416
I can't lock on to them. Don't move.
Don't move!

676
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:09,750
Sulu.

677
01:00:17,104 --> 01:00:18,706
Sulu.

678
01:00:21,308 --> 01:00:23,081
Hold on.

679
01:00:25,017 --> 01:00:27,102
I've gotcha.
Now pull my chute.

680
01:00:33,709 --> 01:00:37,752
Kirk to Enterprise!
We're falling without a chute!

681
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:41,059
- Beam us up!
- I'm sorry I can't lock on to your signal.

682
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,459
- Beam us up!
- You're moving too fast.

683
01:00:42,938 --> 01:00:45,248
I can do that. I can do that!

684
01:00:45,923 --> 01:00:47,723
- Take the con.
- Aye, sir.

685
01:00:47,724 --> 01:00:51,485
The black hole's expanding. We won't reach
minimum safe distance if we don't leave immediately.

686
01:00:53,409 --> 01:00:55,748
Move. Move... I can do that.
I can do that. Move. Move...

687
01:00:58,252 --> 01:01:01,159
Give me manual control, I can lock on.
Beam us up!

688
01:01:02,476 --> 01:01:05,365
- Enterprise, where are you?
- Hold on. Hold on! Hold on!

689
01:01:06,385 --> 01:01:10,810
Now! Now! Now! Do it now!
Now! Now! Now!

690
01:01:10,811 --> 01:01:16,293
Hold on. Hold on. Compensating
gravitational pull. Aaand...

691
01:01:20,149 --> 01:01:21,168
Gotcha.

692
01:01:30,844 --> 01:01:33,295
- Thanks.
- No problem.

693
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:38,072
Clear the pad. I'm beaming to
the surface.

694
01:01:39,611 --> 01:01:41,165
The surface of what?

695
01:01:41,874 --> 01:01:44,441
What, you're going down there?
Are you nuts?

696
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:47,099
- Spock, you can't do that.
- Energize.

697
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:29,442
- Spock? - The planet has only
seconds left. We must evacuate.

698
01:02:30,503 --> 01:02:32,351
Mother, now.

699
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:55,600
Spock to Enterprise.
Get us out now.

700
01:02:55,601 --> 01:02:58,436
Locking on to you. Don't move.
Stay right where you are.

701
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:09,590
Transport in 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ...

702
01:03:11,942 --> 01:03:15,321
- Mother!
- I'm losing her! I'm losing her! ...

703
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:18,302
I've lost her! I've lost her.

704
01:04:15,053 --> 01:04:18,700
Acting captain's log, star date 2258.42.

705
01:04:20,412 --> 01:04:22,791
We have had no word from captain Pike.

706
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:27,946
I have therefore classified him a hostage
of the war criminal known as Nero

707
01:04:28,888 --> 01:04:33,616
Nero, who has destroyed my home planet
and most of its 6 billion inhabitants.

708
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:39,659
While the essence of our culture has been saved
in the elders who now reside upon this ship ...

709
01:04:42,342 --> 01:04:45,414
I estimate no more than
10 000 have survived.

710
01:04:48,558 --> 01:04:52,253
I am now a member of
an endangered species.

711
01:05:19,378 --> 01:05:21,776
I'm sorry.

712
01:05:23,186 --> 01:05:27,865
I'm so sorry.

713
01:05:41,835 --> 01:05:45,985
What do you need.
Tell me. Tell me.

714
01:05:54,421 --> 01:05:56,644
I need everyone ...

715
01:05:57,594 --> 01:06:12,887
- ... to continue performing admirably.
- OK.

716
01:06:27,579 --> 01:06:29,623
You must have a lot of questions for me.

717
01:06:30,526 --> 01:06:32,685
I only have one for you.

718
01:06:34,314 --> 01:06:38,467
I need the subspace frequencies of
Starfleet's border protection grids.

719
01:06:38,762 --> 01:06:41,513
Specifically those surrounding Earth.

720
01:06:43,157 --> 01:06:46,402
Christopher, answer my question.

721
01:06:46,403 --> 01:06:49,719
No, you answer for the genocide you just
committed against a peaceful planet.

722
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,462
No, I prevented genocide.

723
01:06:55,364 --> 01:06:59,719
In my time, where I come from,
this is a simple mining vessel.

724
01:07:00,352 --> 01:07:03,674
I chose a life of honest labor.

725
01:07:03,675 --> 01:07:07,014
to provide for myself and the wife
who was expecting my child.

726
01:07:07,604 --> 01:07:10,004
I was off planet doing my job

727
01:07:10,005 --> 01:07:12,189
while your Federation did nothing.

728
01:07:12,464 --> 01:07:15,576
And allowed my people to burn
while their planet broke in half.

729
01:07:16,081 --> 01:07:19,305
And Spock, he didn't help us.
He betrayed us.

730
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:23,000
No, no... you're confused. You're misinformed.
Romulus hasn't been destroyed.

731
01:07:23,001 --> 01:07:26,575
It's out there right now. You're blaming the
Federation for something that hasn't happened...

732
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:29,852
It has happened! I watched it happen!
I saw it happen!

733
01:07:29,887 --> 01:07:31,556
Don't tell me it didn't happen!

734
01:07:36,132 --> 01:07:40,453
And when I lost her.
I promised myself retribution.

735
01:07:41,097 --> 01:07:44,871
And for 25 years I planned my
revenge against the Federation.

736
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:48,850
And forgot what it was like to
live a normal life.

737
01:07:48,876 --> 01:07:50,973
I did not forget the pain.

738
01:07:52,645 --> 01:07:56,296
It's a pain that every surviving
Vulcan now shares.

739
01:07:57,897 --> 01:07:59,981
My purpose, Christopher,

740
01:07:59,982 --> 01:08:03,871
is to not simply avoid the destruction
of the home that I love

741
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:10,482
but to create a Romulus that
exists free of the Federation.

742
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:16,352
You see only then will she be truly saved.

743
01:08:17,247 --> 01:08:21,431
That is why I will destroy all the
remaining Federation planets.

744
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:23,587
Starting with yours.

745
01:08:24,473 --> 01:08:27,038
Then we have nothing left to discuss.

746
01:08:31,158 --> 01:08:34,128
You will give me the frequencies to
disable Earth's defenses.

747
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:41,616
Centaurian slugs. They latch
on to your brain stem...

748
01:08:43,428 --> 01:08:45,959
and release a toxin that will
force you to answer.

749
01:08:47,524 --> 01:08:49,546
Frequencies please, sir.

750
01:08:50,195 --> 01:08:52,438
Christopher Pike, captain of
the USS Enterprise ...

751
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:53,438
As you wish.

752
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:03,267
Have you confirmed that Nero
is heading for Earth?

753
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:05,967
Their trajectory suggests no
other destination, captain.

754
01:09:06,578 --> 01:09:07,771
Thank you, lt.

755
01:09:08,096 --> 01:09:10,398
Earth may be his next stop, but
we have to assume 

756
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,390
every Federation planet's a target

757
01:09:12,391 --> 01:09:13,926
Out of the chair.

758
01:09:13,927 --> 01:09:18,093
Well, if the Federation is the target,
why didn't they destroy us?

759
01:09:18,094 --> 01:09:21,051
Why would they? Why waste a weapon?
We obviously weren't a threat.

760
01:09:21,052 --> 01:09:25,828
That is not it. He said he wanted me to see
something. The destruction of my home planet.

761
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,743
How the hell did they do that, by the way?

762
01:09:27,744 --> 01:09:30,060
And where did the Romulans get
that kind of weaponry?

763
01:09:30,061 --> 01:09:33,674
The engineering comprehension necessary
to artificially create a black hole

764
01:09:33,675 --> 01:09:35,319
may suggest an answer.

765
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,823
Such technology could theoretically
be manipulated

766
01:09:37,824 --> 01:09:39,685
to create a tunnel through space-time.

767
01:09:40,088 --> 01:09:41,956
Damn it man, I am a doctor, not physicist.

768
01:09:41,957 --> 01:09:44,140
Are you actually suggesting
they're from the future?

769
01:09:44,141 --> 01:09:47,219
If you eliminate the impossible, what ever
remains, however improbable

770
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,445
must be the truth.

771
01:09:48,446 --> 01:09:49,447
How poetic.

772
01:09:49,448 --> 01:09:53,232
Then what would an angry future
Romulan want with captain Pike?

773
01:09:53,233 --> 01:09:55,888
As captain he does know details
of Starfleet's defenses.

774
01:09:55,889 --> 01:09:57,464
What we need to do is catch
up to that ship,

775
01:09:57,465 --> 01:09:59,600
disable it, take it over and get Pike back.

776
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:04,120
We are technologically outmatched in every
way. A rescue attempt would be illogical.

777
01:10:04,121 --> 01:10:07,055
Nero's ship would have to drop
out of warp for us to overtake it.

778
01:10:07,056 --> 01:10:10,336
Then what about assigning engineering
crews to try and boost our warp yield?

779
01:10:10,337 --> 01:10:12,605
Remaining power and crew are being
used to repair radiation leaks

780
01:10:12,606 --> 01:10:14,263
on the lower decks. The damage ...

781
01:10:14,264 --> 01:10:16,801
- OK. All right. All right. - ...communications.
Without it... - There's got to be some way.

782
01:10:16,802 --> 01:10:21,388
- ...we cannot contact Starfleet. We
must gather with the rest of Starfleet.

783
01:10:21,389 --> 01:10:23,138
To balance the terms of the next engagement,
- There won't be a next engagement.

784
01:10:23,138 --> 01:10:25,851
By the time we gather it'll be too late.

785
01:10:26,552 --> 01:10:28,705
Look, you say he's from the future and
knows what's gonna happen

786
01:10:28,706 --> 01:10:31,101
then the logical thing is to be unpredictable.

787
01:10:31,136 --> 01:10:34,013
You're assuming that Nero knows
how event's are predicted to unfold.

788
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,134
The contrary. Nero's very presence
has altered the flow of history

789
01:10:37,135 --> 01:10:40,276
beginning with the attack on the USS Kelvin,
culminating with the events of today,

790
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:45,526
thereby creating an entire new chain of incidents
that cannot be anticipated by either party.

791
01:10:45,527 --> 01:10:46,935
An alternate reality.

792
01:10:48,002 --> 01:10:49,667
Precisely.

793
01:10:49,934 --> 01:10:51,454
Whatever our lives might have been

794
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:53,268
if the time continuum was disrupted

795
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:56,594
our destinies have changed.

796
01:10:56,683 --> 01:10:59,256
Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the
Laurentian system. Warp factor 3.

797
01:10:59,257 --> 01:11:00,537
Spock, don't do that.

798
01:11:00,538 --> 01:11:05,045
Running back to the rest of the fleet for
a con fab is a massive waste of time...

799
01:11:05,046 --> 01:11:06,787
These orders were issued by
captain Pike when he left.

800
01:11:06,788 --> 01:11:08,554
He also ordered us to go back and get him.

801
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:12,027
- Spock, you are captain now. You have...
- I am aware of my responsibilities ...

802
01:11:12,028 --> 01:11:14,425
Every second we waste Nero's
getting closer to his next target.

803
01:11:14,426 --> 01:11:17,481
That is correct and why I'm instructing
you to accept the fact that I'm...

804
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:21,518
I will not allow us to go backwards...
... instead of hunting Nero down.

805
01:11:21,519 --> 01:11:23,860
Security, escort him out.

806
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,332
- No.
- Jim!

807
01:11:39,538 --> 01:11:41,537
Get him off this ship.

808
01:12:01,581 --> 01:12:02,935
Computer, where am I?

809
01:12:02,936 --> 01:12:06,438
Location: Delta Vega.
Class M planet. Unsafe.

810
01:12:06,439 --> 01:12:10,261
There is a Starfleet outpost 14km
to the northwest.

811
01:12:10,262 --> 01:12:13,811
- Remain in your pod ...
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

812
01:12:56,435 --> 01:13:00,040
Star date 2258.42.

813
01:13:00,694 --> 01:13:04,087
... for ... for ... Whatever.

814
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:08,182
Acting captain Spock has
marooned me on Delta Vega.

815
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:12,879
What I believe to be a violation
of security protocol 49.09

816
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,401
governing the treatment of prisoners
aboard a starship.

817
01:15:25,828 --> 01:15:28,571
James T. Kirk.

818
01:15:29,894 --> 01:15:32,056
- Excuse me?
- How did you find me?

819
01:15:34,368 --> 01:15:36,412
How do you know my name?

820
01:15:37,342 --> 01:15:41,433
I have been and always shall be your friend.

821
01:15:44,928 --> 01:15:47,614
Look, I don't know you.

822
01:15:47,615 --> 01:15:50,362
I am Spock.

823
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,859
Bullshit.

824
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:58,476
It is remarkably pleasing to see
you again old friend.

825
01:15:59,278 --> 01:16:01,881
Especially after the events today.

826
01:16:03,766 --> 01:16:05,886
Sir, I appreciate what you did for me today

827
01:16:05,887 --> 01:16:09,643
but if you were Spock, you'd know
we're not friends at all.

828
01:16:09,644 --> 01:16:12,091
You hate me. You marooned
me here for mutiny.

829
01:16:12,154 --> 01:16:14,189
- Mutiny?
- Yes.

830
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:16,181
You are not the captain?

831
01:16:19,237 --> 01:16:23,281
No, no... You're the captain.

832
01:16:23,501 --> 01:16:25,801
Pike was taken hostage.

833
01:16:26,186 --> 01:16:28,174
By Nero?

834
01:16:33,231 --> 01:16:35,649
What do you know about him?

835
01:16:36,105 --> 01:16:39,005
He is a particularly troubled Romulan.

836
01:16:40,071 --> 01:16:42,226
Please. Allow me.

837
01:16:43,068 --> 01:16:44,412
It will be easier.

838
01:16:44,617 --> 01:16:48,267
- Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
- Our minds, one and together.

839
01:16:50,747 --> 01:16:56,854
129 years from now, a star will explode
and threaten to destroy the galaxy.

840
01:16:58,374 --> 01:17:01,210
That is where I'm from Jim.

841
01:17:01,212 --> 01:17:02,612
The future.

842
01:17:06,615 --> 01:17:09,157
A star went supernova.

843
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:13,366
Consuming everything in its path.

844
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:16,719
I promised the Romulans that I
will save their planet.

845
01:17:22,164 --> 01:17:24,487
We outfitted our fastest ship.

846
01:17:25,488 --> 01:17:28,232
Using red matter I would create a black hole

847
01:17:28,233 --> 01:17:30,965
which would absorb the exploding star.

848
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:35,227
I was on root when the unthinkable happened.

849
01:17:36,557 --> 01:17:40,325
The supernova destroyed Romulus.

850
01:17:45,547 --> 01:17:47,447
I had little time.

851
01:17:49,722 --> 01:17:53,703
I had to extract the red matter
and shoot it into the supernova.

852
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:13,039
As I began my return trip I was intercepted.

853
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:17,177
- He called himself Nero,
- ... collapse of Romulan Empire.

854
01:18:17,178 --> 01:18:21,092
In my attempt to escape, both of
us were pulled into the black hole.

855
01:18:29,681 --> 01:18:33,329
Nero went through first.
He was the first to arrive.

856
01:18:40,618 --> 01:18:43,816
Nero spent the next 25 years
awaiting my arrival.

857
01:18:43,817 --> 01:18:45,910
But what was years for Nero

858
01:18:47,447 --> 01:18:49,635
was only seconds for me.

859
01:18:50,487 --> 01:18:52,775
I went through the black hole.

860
01:18:54,741 --> 01:18:57,958
Nero was waiting for me.

861
01:19:02,925 --> 01:19:06,177
He held me responsible for the
loss of his world.

862
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:10,689
He captured my vessel and spared my life.

863
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:16,757
For one reason. So that
I would know his pain.

864
01:19:18,777 --> 01:19:22,847
He beamed me here so that
I can observe his vengeance.

865
01:19:24,721 --> 01:19:27,762
As he was helpless to save his planet

866
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:31,589
I would be helpless to save mine.

867
01:19:33,795 --> 01:19:38,194
Billions of lives lost because of me, Jim.

868
01:19:38,195 --> 01:19:41,206
Because I failed.

869
01:19:43,348 --> 01:19:47,527
Forgive me. Emotional transference
is an effect of the mind meld.

870
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:57,940
- So you do feel.
- Yes.

871
01:19:57,941 --> 01:20:00,758
Going back in time you changed all our lives.

872
01:20:01,569 --> 01:20:04,582
Jim! We must go.

873
01:20:05,082 --> 01:20:07,457
There is a Starfleet outpost not far from here.

874
01:20:09,019 --> 01:20:10,645
Wait.

875
01:20:11,266 --> 01:20:13,508
Where you came from ...

876
01:20:15,601 --> 01:20:17,536
... did I know my father?

877
01:20:18,577 --> 01:20:19,964
Yes.

878
01:20:20,364 --> 01:20:23,766
You often spoke of him as being
your inspiration for joining Starfleet.

879
01:20:24,744 --> 01:20:28,239
He proudly lived to see you become
captain of the Enterprise.

880
01:20:28,831 --> 01:20:30,070
Captain?

881
01:20:30,072 --> 01:20:33,099
A ship we must return you to
as soon as possible.

882
01:20:41,725 --> 01:20:44,305
- Warp 3, sir.
- Course 151-3.

883
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:46,551
- Laurentian system, sir.
- Thank you gentlemen.

884
01:20:46,985 --> 01:20:50,508
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes. Doctor.

885
01:20:51,732 --> 01:20:53,973
I am aware that James Kirk is a friend of yours.

886
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:56,955
I recognize that supporting me
as you did must have been difficult.

887
01:20:56,956 --> 01:20:58,669
Is that thank you?

888
01:20:58,963 --> 01:21:03,573
- I am simply acknowledging your difficulties.
- Permission to speak freely, sir.

889
01:21:04,848 --> 01:21:06,706
- I welcome it.
- Do you?

890
01:21:07,528 --> 01:21:10,575
Ok then. Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

891
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:15,498
Are you making a logical choice sending
Kirk away? Probably. But the right one? 

892
01:21:15,499 --> 01:21:18,671
Back home we've got a saying. If you're
gonna ride in the Kentucky derby

893
01:21:18,672 --> 01:21:20,926
you don't leave your prize stallion in the stable

894
01:21:20,927 --> 01:21:24,683
A curious metaphor, Doctor,
as a stallion must first be broken

895
01:21:24,684 --> 01:21:26,569
before it can reach its potential.

896
01:21:27,102 --> 01:21:29,421
My God man. You could at least
act like it was a hard decision.

897
01:21:29,422 --> 01:21:32,858
I intend to insist in the effort to reestablish
communication with Starfleet.

898
01:21:33,329 --> 01:21:37,199
However, if crew moral is better served
by my roaming the halls weeping

899
01:21:37,235 --> 01:21:40,391
I would gladly defer to your medical expertise.

900
01:21:41,721 --> 01:21:43,189
Excuse me.

901
01:21:47,291 --> 01:21:49,389
Green blooded little goblin.

902
01:23:09,973 --> 01:23:11,482
What?

903
01:23:15,247 --> 01:23:17,343
You realize how unacceptable this is?

904
01:23:17,344 --> 01:23:18,665
- Fascinating.
- What?

905
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:21,947
I am sure you're just doing your job, but
could you not come a wee bit sooner?

906
01:23:21,948 --> 01:23:26,827
Six months I've been here. Living off Starfleet
botty nips and a promise of a good meal.

907
01:23:26,862 --> 01:23:29,372
And I know exactly what's going on here.

908
01:23:29,373 --> 01:23:33,545
Ok? Punishment, isn't it? Ongoing. For
something that was clearly an accident.

909
01:23:33,546 --> 01:23:36,573
- You are Montgomery Scott.
- You know him?

910
01:23:36,573 --> 01:23:38,269
Yeah, it's me. You're in the right place.

911
01:23:38,464 --> 01:23:41,578
Unless there’s another hard working
equally starved Starfleet officer around.

912
01:23:41,579 --> 01:23:43,786
- Me.
- Getup, shut up.

913
01:23:44,628 --> 01:23:47,822
You aren't doing anything. You can
eat, like, a bean and you're done.

914
01:23:48,142 --> 01:23:50,284
I'm talking about food, real food.

915
01:23:50,285 --> 01:23:52,954
But you're here now. So, thank you.
Where is it?

916
01:23:52,955 --> 01:23:57,107
You are in fact a Mr. Scott who postulated
the theory of transwarp beaming?

917
01:23:57,108 --> 01:24:00,235
That's what I'm talking about.
How'd ya think I wound up here?

918
01:24:00,696 --> 01:24:02,448
I had a little debate with my instructor

919
01:24:02,449 --> 01:24:06,127
on the issue of relativistic physics and
how it pertains to subspace travel.

920
01:24:06,128 --> 01:24:10,162
He seemed to think that the range of
transporting something like a grapefruit

921
01:24:10,163 --> 01:24:12,130
was limited to about a 100 miles.

922
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:15,925
I told him that I could not only beam a
grapefruit from one planet to the adjacent planet

923
01:24:15,926 --> 01:24:18,629
in the same system, which is easy by the way

924
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:20,491
I could do it with a life form.

925
01:24:21,108 --> 01:24:23,553
So, I tested it on admiral Archer's prize beagle.

926
01:24:23,554 --> 01:24:25,197
I know that dog. What happened to it?

927
01:24:25,719 --> 01:24:29,056
I'll tell you when it reappears. I don't
know. I do feel guilty about that.

928
01:24:29,057 --> 01:24:32,035
What if I told you that your transwarp theory was correct?

929
01:24:32,036 --> 01:24:35,322
That it is indeed possible to beam onto
a ship that is travelling at warp speed?

930
01:24:35,323 --> 01:24:37,908
I think that if that equation had been
discovered I'd have heard about it.

931
01:24:37,909 --> 01:24:39,939
The reason you haven't
heard of it, Mr. Scott,

932
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:42,274
is because you haven't discovered it yet.

933
01:24:47,742 --> 01:24:51,608
- Are you from the future?
- He is. I'm not.

934
01:24:51,609 --> 01:24:54,355
Well that's brilliant. Do they still
have sandwiches there?

935
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,437
Well, she's a wee bit dodgy.

936
01:24:57,724 --> 01:25:00,197
Shield emitters are totally bum jacked
as well as a few other things.

937
01:25:00,326 --> 01:25:01,776
In you go.

938
01:25:02,558 --> 01:25:04,700
So, the Enterprise has had it's
maiden voyage, has it?

939
01:25:04,702 --> 01:25:06,525
She is one well endowed lady.

940
01:25:06,526 --> 01:25:10,582
I'd like to get my hands on her ample nossels,
if you'd pardon the engineering parlance.

941
01:25:12,872 --> 01:25:16,835
Except, the thing is, even if I believed you.
Where you're from, what I've done...

942
01:25:16,836 --> 01:25:21,215
Which I don't, by the way. We're still
talking about beaming aboard the Enterprise

943
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:24,095
while she's travelling faster than light
without a proper receiving pad.

944
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,644
Get off there. It's not a climbing frame.

945
01:25:27,187 --> 01:25:28,519
The notion of transwarp beaming

946
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:31,881
is like trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet

947
01:25:31,882 --> 01:25:34,877
whilst wearing a blindfold, riding a horse.

948
01:25:34,878 --> 01:25:35,915
What's that?

949
01:25:35,916 --> 01:25:39,181
Your equation for achieving transwarp beaming.

950
01:25:41,442 --> 01:25:43,335
You're out of it...

951
01:25:46,710 --> 01:25:50,710
Imagine that. It never occurred to me to
think of space as the thing that was moving

952
01:25:51,286 --> 01:25:53,323
You're coming with us, right?

953
01:25:55,174 --> 01:25:57,457
No, Jim. That is not my destiny.

954
01:25:58,219 --> 01:25:59,774
Your destiny ...

955
01:26:00,384 --> 01:26:02,982
He. The other Spock is not gonna believe me.
Only you can explain what the hell has happened.

956
01:26:02,983 --> 01:26:07,240
Under no circumstances can he be made aware
of my existence. You must promise me that.

957
01:26:07,241 --> 01:26:11,660
So you're telling me I can't tell you that I'm following
you're own orders. Why not? What happens?

958
01:26:11,661 --> 01:26:14,046
Jim, this is one rule you cannot break.

959
01:26:14,047 --> 01:26:17,798
To stop Nero, you alone must
take command of your ship.

960
01:26:17,799 --> 01:26:19,583
How? Over your dead body?

961
01:26:19,584 --> 01:26:20,766
Preferably, not.

962
01:26:20,767 --> 01:26:23,738
However, there is Starfleet regulation 619.

963
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:29,886
619 states that any command officer who is 
emotionally compromised by the mission at hand

964
01:26:29,887 --> 01:26:32,480
must resign command.

965
01:26:34,759 --> 01:26:38,662
So, you're saying that I have to
emotionally compromise you... guys?

966
01:26:38,663 --> 01:26:41,997
Jim, I just lost my planet.

967
01:26:42,945 --> 01:26:46,689
I can tell you, I am emotionally compromised.

968
01:26:47,009 --> 01:26:49,770
What you must do is get me to show it.

969
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:52,499
Aye then lady. Live or die.
Let's get this over with.

970
01:26:59,267 --> 01:27:01,479
You cannot come with me. Go on.

971
01:27:02,612 --> 01:27:07,103
Coming back in time, changing history,
that's cheating.

972
01:27:09,419 --> 01:27:12,225
A trick I learned from an old friend.

973
01:27:20,646 --> 01:27:24,233
Live long and prosper.

974
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:45,546
Mr. Scott?

975
01:27:49,949 --> 01:27:52,155
Mr. Scott, can you hear me?

976
01:27:59,685 --> 01:28:02,560
Hold on a second.

977
01:28:19,703 --> 01:28:20,932
No. No!

978
01:28:31,788 --> 01:28:32,914
RELEASE VALVE.

979
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:43,067
Purifier release valve activated.

980
01:28:49,445 --> 01:28:52,079
You all right? You all right?

981
01:28:54,019 --> 01:28:56,674
My head's buzzing and I'm soaked,
but otherwise I'm fine.

982
01:28:56,675 --> 01:29:02,139
Captain Spock, detecting unauthorized
access to water turbine control board

983
01:29:02,532 --> 01:29:04,298
Bring up the video.

984
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:11,585
Security, seal the engineering deck.
We have intruders in turbine section 3.

985
01:29:12,671 --> 01:29:14,250
Set phasers to stun.

986
01:29:25,969 --> 01:29:27,482
Halt!

987
01:29:31,201 --> 01:29:32,541
Come with me

988
01:29:32,939 --> 01:29:34,949
cupcake!

989
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:43,322
Who are you?

990
01:29:43,323 --> 01:29:44,324
- I am with him.
- He's with me.

991
01:29:44,325 --> 01:29:47,578
We are travelling at warp speed. How
did you manage to beam aboard this ship?

992
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:48,920
You're the genius, you figure it out.

993
01:29:48,921 --> 01:29:52,045
As acting captain of this vessel
I order you to answer the question.

994
01:29:52,046 --> 01:29:54,412
Well I'm not telling, acting captain.

995
01:29:57,188 --> 01:30:01,485
What now? That doesn't frustrate you, does it? My
lack of cooperation, that doesn't make you angry?

996
01:30:01,486 --> 01:30:04,996
- Are you a member of Starfleet?
- Yes. Can I get a towel?

997
01:30:04,998 --> 01:30:07,481
Under penalty of court martial I order
you to explain to me how you were able

998
01:30:07,482 --> 01:30:09,734
to beam aboard the ship while moving at warp

999
01:30:10,184 --> 01:30:11,231
- Well.
- Don't answer him.

1000
01:30:11,233 --> 01:30:13,574
You will answer me.

1001
01:30:14,759 --> 01:30:17,610
- I'd rather not take sides.
- What is it with you, Spock?

1002
01:30:20,005 --> 01:30:25,073
Your planet was just destroyed, your
mother murdered, and you're not even upset.

1003
01:30:25,074 --> 01:30:27,589
If you are presuming that these
experiences in any way impede 

1004
01:30:27,649 --> 01:30:29,784
my ability to command this ship
you are mistaking.

1005
01:30:29,785 --> 01:30:33,377
And yet you were the one who said
fear was necessary for command.

1006
01:30:33,378 --> 01:30:36,669
I mean, did you his ship?
Did you see what he did?

1007
01:30:37,543 --> 01:30:39,695
- Yes, of course I did.
- So are you afraid or aren't you?

1008
01:30:39,696 --> 01:30:42,203
I will not allow you to lecture me
about the merits of emotion.

1009
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:44,049
- Then why don't you stop me?
- Step away from me Mr. Kirk.

1010
01:30:44,050 --> 01:30:48,051
What is it like not to feel anger?
Or heartbreak?

1011
01:30:48,052 --> 01:30:51,495
Or the need to stop at nothing to avenge the
death of the woman who gave birth to you.

1012
01:30:51,496 --> 01:30:53,434
- Back away from me.
- You feel nothing!

1013
01:30:53,435 --> 01:30:55,975
It must not even compute for you.

1014
01:30:56,578 --> 01:30:58,310
You never loved her!

1015
01:31:22,665 --> 01:31:24,205
Spock.

1016
01:32:01,339 --> 01:32:04,057
Doctor, I am no longer fit for duty.

1017
01:32:04,058 --> 01:32:08,860
I relinquish my command based on the fact
that I have been emotionally compromised.

1018
01:32:09,935 --> 01:32:12,186
Please note the time and
date in the ship's log.

1019
01:32:39,109 --> 01:32:41,170
I like this ship.

1020
01:32:41,437 --> 01:32:43,055
You know it's exciting.

1021
01:32:45,474 --> 01:32:49,289
Well congratulations, Jim. Now we've got
no captain and no God damn first officer

1022
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:50,765
to replace him.

1023
01:32:52,154 --> 01:32:53,872
Yeah we do.

1024
01:32:53,873 --> 01:32:56,382
- What?
- Pike made him first officer.

1025
01:32:56,734 --> 01:32:59,539
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Thanks for the support.

1026
01:33:02,683 --> 01:33:06,583
I sure hope you know what you're
doing, captain.

1027
01:33:07,859 --> 01:33:09,823
So do I.

1028
01:33:14,088 --> 01:33:16,771
Attention, crew of the Enterprise,
this is James Kirk.

1029
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:21,814
Mr. Spock has resigned commission
and advanced me to acting captain.

1030
01:33:22,789 --> 01:33:25,631
I know you're all expecting a regroup with the fleet,

1031
01:33:26,185 --> 01:33:28,445
but I'm ordering a pursuit course
of the enemy ship to Earth.

1032
01:33:28,446 --> 01:33:31,266
I want all departments at battle
stations and ready in 10 minutes.

1033
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:36,617
Either we're going down or they are.

1034
01:33:37,273 --> 01:33:38,629
Kirk out.

1035
01:33:46,318 --> 01:33:48,626
Speak your mind Spock.

1036
01:33:51,168 --> 01:33:53,133
That would be unwise.

1037
01:33:53,134 --> 01:33:57,086
What is necessary is never unwise.

1038
01:33:58,414 --> 01:34:01,563
I am as conflicted as I once was as a child.

1039
01:34:03,298 --> 01:34:06,176
You will always be a child of two worlds.

1040
01:34:07,979 --> 01:34:10,728
I am grateful for this.

1041
01:34:11,776 --> 01:34:13,788
And for you.

1042
01:34:15,225 --> 01:34:18,483
I feel anger for the one who took mother's life.

1043
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:22,686
An anger I cannot control.

1044
01:34:26,285 --> 01:34:31,791
I believe, as she would say ...

1045
01:34:32,607 --> 01:34:35,423
... do not try to.

1046
01:34:35,717 --> 01:34:40,407
You asked me once why I married your mother.

1047
01:34:44,585 --> 01:34:47,421
I married her because I loved her.

1048
01:34:55,171 --> 01:34:57,621
Whatever the case we need to
get aboard Nero's ship undetected.

1049
01:34:57,622 --> 01:35:00,150
Just can't just go in there guns blazing, Jim.

1050
01:35:00,151 --> 01:35:01,952
I'm telling you to ...

1051
01:35:01,953 --> 01:35:04,832
- Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk.
- Yes, Chekov. What is it?

1052
01:35:04,833 --> 01:35:06,734
Based on the Nerada’s course
from Vulcan

1053
01:35:06,735 --> 01:35:10,124
I have projected that Nero will
travel pass Saturn.

1054
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:13,636
Like you said we need to stay
invisible to Nero or he'll destroy us.

1055
01:35:13,637 --> 01:35:16,256
If Mr. Scott can get us to warp factor 4

1056
01:35:16,257 --> 01:35:20,705
and if we drop out of warp behind one
of Saturn's moons, say Titan.

1057
01:35:20,706 --> 01:35:23,280
The magnetic distortion from
the planet's rings

1058
01:35:23,281 --> 01:35:25,804
will make us invisible to Nero's sensors.

1059
01:35:25,805 --> 01:35:28,264
From there, as long as the drill
is not activated

1060
01:35:28,265 --> 01:35:29,923
we can beam aboard the enemy ship.

1061
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:31,706
Aye, that might work.

1062
01:35:32,247 --> 01:35:34,715
- Wait a minute kid, how old are you?
- 17, sir.

1063
01:35:35,274 --> 01:35:36,637
Oh good, he's 17.

1064
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,378
Doctor.

1065
01:35:38,379 --> 01:35:42,021
Mr. Chekov is correct. I can
confirm his telemetry.

1066
01:35:42,164 --> 01:35:44,356
If Mr. Sulu is able to maneuver us into position

1067
01:35:44,356 --> 01:35:47,157
I can beam aboard Nero's ship,
steal back the black hole device 

1068
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:49,594
and if possible bring back captain Pike.

1069
01:35:50,004 --> 01:35:51,980
I won't allow you to do that Mr. Spock.

1070
01:35:52,674 --> 01:35:55,423
Romulans and Vulcans
share a common ancestry.

1071
01:35:55,811 --> 01:35:59,481
Our cultural similarities will make it easier
for me to access the ship's computer

1072
01:35:59,482 --> 01:36:00,882
and locate the device.

1073
01:36:02,348 --> 01:36:06,490
Also my mother was human. Which
makes Earth the only home I have left.

1074
01:36:13,931 --> 01:36:15,845
I'm coming with you.

1075
01:36:16,078 --> 01:36:19,282
I would cite regulation, but
I know you will simply ignore it.

1076
01:36:21,847 --> 01:36:25,024
See? We are getting to know each other.

1077
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:42,459
Prepare the drill.

1078
01:36:57,933 --> 01:37:03,949
All stop in 3 ... 2 ... 1.

1079
01:37:08,889 --> 01:37:11,840
Gimme 1/4 impulse burst for 5 seconds.

1080
01:37:11,841 --> 01:37:13,756
I'll do the rest with thrusters.
On my mark.

1081
01:37:13,757 --> 01:37:14,757
Aye.

1082
01:37:15,407 --> 01:37:16,456
Fire.

1083
01:37:43,182 --> 01:37:45,745
Transporter room. We are in
position above Titan.

1084
01:37:46,119 --> 01:37:48,887
Really? Fine job Mr. Sulu, well done.

1085
01:37:49,497 --> 01:37:52,727
- How are we Scotty?
- Unbelievably sir. The ship is in position.

1086
01:37:56,628 --> 01:38:00,588
Whatever happens Mr. Sulu, if you
think you have the tactical advantage 

1087
01:38:00,589 --> 01:38:03,832
you fire on that ship even if we're still
on board. That's an order.

1088
01:38:06,172 --> 01:38:07,183
Yes, sir.

1089
01:38:07,184 --> 01:38:10,116
Otherwise we'll contact the Enterprise
when we're ready to be beamed back.

1090
01:38:11,057 --> 01:38:13,265
Good luck.

1091
01:38:25,269 --> 01:38:28,174
- I will be back.
- You better be.

1092
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:33,545
- I'll be monitoring your frequency.
- Thank you, Nyota.

1093
01:38:49,862 --> 01:38:52,636
- So her first name's Nyota?
- I have no comment on the matter.

1094
01:38:52,637 --> 01:38:56,049
Oky doky then. If there’s any common
sense in the design of the enemy's ship 

1095
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:59,139
I should be putting you somewhere in the
cargo bay, shouldn't be a soul in site.

1096
01:38:59,435 --> 01:39:00,545
Energize.

1097
01:39:43,885 --> 01:39:46,564
Captain, we have Starfleet officers
aboard the ship.

1098
01:39:46,565 --> 01:39:49,214
- One of them is Vulcan.
- No.

1099
01:39:53,653 --> 01:39:55,463
Ayel!

1100
01:40:09,348 --> 01:40:11,801
- I'll cover ya.
- Are you certain?

1101
01:40:11,802 --> 01:40:13,359
Yeah, I've gotcha.

1102
01:40:32,888 --> 01:40:36,379
Do you know where it is?
The black hole device?

1103
01:40:38,148 --> 01:40:40,341
And captain Pike.

1104
01:41:02,356 --> 01:41:03,454
Move.

1105
01:41:04,287 --> 01:41:06,374
They have activated the drill.

1106
01:41:07,371 --> 01:41:08,981
Communication and transportation are inoperative.

1107
01:41:08,982 --> 01:41:10,561
Sulu, please tell me you have them.

1108
01:41:10,668 --> 01:41:12,269
Otherwise we won't be
able to beam them back.

1109
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:14,253
Kirk and Spock are on their own now.

1110
01:41:33,333 --> 01:41:37,019
I foresee a complication. The design of this ship
is far more advanced than I have anticipated.

1111
01:41:37,329 --> 01:41:40,228
Voice print and face recognition
analysis enabled.

1112
01:41:40,522 --> 01:41:42,620
Welcome back ambassador Spock.

1113
01:41:42,621 --> 01:41:44,104
That's weird.

1114
01:41:45,375 --> 01:41:48,335
Computer, what is your manufacturing origin?

1115
01:41:48,395 --> 01:41:52,974
Star date 2387. Commissioned by the
Vulcan Science Academy.

1116
01:41:56,034 --> 01:41:58,229
It appears that you have been keeping
important information from me.

1117
01:41:58,230 --> 01:42:00,373
You'll be able to fly this thing, right?

1118
01:42:00,374 --> 01:42:02,285
Something tells me I already have.

1119
01:42:03,471 --> 01:42:05,330
- Good luck.
- Jim.

1120
01:42:06,346 --> 01:42:09,980
The statistical likelihood that our
plan will succeed is less than 4,3%.

1121
01:42:09,981 --> 01:42:10,520
I will work.

1122
01:42:10,521 --> 01:42:12,843
In the event that I don't return
please tell lt. Uhura ...

1123
01:42:12,844 --> 01:42:14,773
Spock, it'll work.

1124
01:42:25,396 --> 01:42:26,835
Fascinating.

1125
01:42:35,401 --> 01:42:38,136
Startup sequence initiated.

1126
01:43:21,808 --> 01:43:24,491
Nero, order your men to disable
the drill or I will ...

1127
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:37,580
I know your face from Earth's history.

1128
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:25,211
James T. Kirk was considered
to be a great man.

1129
01:44:26,065 --> 01:44:30,004
He went on to captain the USS
Enterprise. But that was another life.

1130
01:44:30,809 --> 01:44:33,634
A life I will deprive you of just like
I did your father.

1131
01:45:06,493 --> 01:45:10,400
Captain Nero. The Vulcan ship's been
taken. The drill has been destroyed.

1132
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:15,570
Spock! Spock!

1133
01:45:33,187 --> 01:45:35,005
- Open a channel.
- Yes, sir.

1134
01:45:36,281 --> 01:45:39,573
Spock, I knew I should have
killed you when I had the chance.

1135
01:45:39,574 --> 01:45:41,780
I hereby confiscate this illegally
obtained ship

1136
01:45:41,781 --> 01:45:43,621
and order you to surrender your
vessel. No terms.

1137
01:45:43,622 --> 01:45:45,138
That ship ... take it out.

1138
01:45:45,139 --> 01:45:48,344
- Sir, if you ignite the red matter..
- I want the Spock dead now!

1139
01:46:03,986 --> 01:46:05,787
- He went to warp.
- Go after him.

1140
01:46:05,788 --> 01:46:06,786
Yes, sir.

1141
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:39,769
Your species is even weaker
than I expected.

1142
01:46:43,684 --> 01:46:45,634
You can't even speak.

1143
01:46:47,753 --> 01:46:48,980
What?

1144
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:51,847
I got your gun.

1145
01:47:17,793 --> 01:47:19,101
What's he doing?

1146
01:47:19,102 --> 01:47:22,224
Ambassador Spock, you are
on a collision course.

1147
01:47:22,632 --> 01:47:24,333
Fire everything.

1148
01:47:31,008 --> 01:47:35,174
Incoming missiles. If the ship is hit,
the red matter will be ignited.

1149
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:37,127
Understood.

1150
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,555
Captain, I've picked up another ship.

1151
01:48:06,087 --> 01:48:08,600
- What are you doing here?
- Following orders.

1152
01:48:29,378 --> 01:48:31,278
Enterprise now!

1153
01:48:53,907 --> 01:48:55,650
Nice timing Scotty.

1154
01:48:56,387 --> 01:48:58,714
I've never beamed three people
from two targets

1155
01:48:58,715 --> 01:49:00,266
onto one pad before.

1156
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:03,123
- Jim. - Bones.
-I've got him.

1157
01:49:06,261 --> 01:49:08,184
That was pretty good.

1158
01:49:08,728 --> 01:49:11,955
Captain, the enemy ship is loosing
power. They're shields are down.

1159
01:49:12,070 --> 01:49:13,975
- Hail them now.
- Aye.

1160
01:49:49,385 --> 01:49:52,163
This is captain James T. Kirk
of the USS Enterprise.

1161
01:49:52,681 --> 01:49:55,338
Your ship is compromised. You're
too close to the singularity

1162
01:49:55,339 --> 01:49:58,353
to survive without assistance
which we are willing to provide.

1163
01:50:01,523 --> 01:50:03,439
Captain, what are you doing?

1164
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:06,006
Showing them compassion may be the only way
to make peace with Romulus, Spock.

1165
01:50:06,007 --> 01:50:09,032
It's logical, Spock.
Thought you'd like that.

1166
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:12,147
No, not really. Not this time.

1167
01:50:12,148 --> 01:50:16,393
I would rather suffer the end of
Romulus a thousand times,

1168
01:50:16,459 --> 01:50:20,958
I would rather die in agony than
accept assistance from you.

1169
01:50:20,959 --> 01:50:22,158
You've got it.

1170
01:50:22,801 --> 01:50:25,146
Arm phasers. Fire everything we've got.

1171
01:50:25,147 --> 01:50:26,147
Yes, sir.

1172
01:51:11,023 --> 01:51:13,149
- Sulu, let's go home.
- Yes, sir.

1173
01:51:24,348 --> 01:51:26,723
- Why aren't we at warp?
- We are, sir.

1174
01:51:26,724 --> 01:51:29,056
Kirk to engineering.
Get us out of here, Scotty.

1175
01:51:29,057 --> 01:51:31,080
You bet your ass captain.

1176
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:36,198
Captain, we're caught in
the gravity well. It's got us.

1177
01:51:36,199 --> 01:51:37,868
Go to maximum warp. Push it!

1178
01:51:37,869 --> 01:51:39,891
I'm giving it all she's got captain.

1179
01:51:49,003 --> 01:51:51,568
All she's got isn't good enough.
What else you got?

1180
01:51:51,569 --> 01:51:53,929
Ok, if we eject the core and detonate

1181
01:51:53,930 --> 01:51:56,820
the blast could be enough to push us away.
I can't promise anything though.

1182
01:52:00,086 --> 01:52:02,025
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1183
01:52:02,650 --> 01:52:04,554
- Clear the area. Go!
- Yes, sir.

1184
01:53:32,043 --> 01:53:33,516
Father?

1185
01:53:42,036 --> 01:53:44,715
I am not our father.

1186
01:53:51,608 --> 01:53:56,254
There are so few Vulcans left we
cannot afford to ignore each other.

1187
01:53:59,306 --> 01:54:02,245
Then why did you send Kirk aboard when
you alone could have explained the truth?

1188
01:54:02,246 --> 01:54:04,260
Because you needed each other.

1189
01:54:04,261 --> 01:54:08,701
I could not deprive you of the revelation
of all that you can accomplish together.

1190
01:54:08,702 --> 01:54:12,032
Of a friendship that will define you both.

1191
01:54:12,033 --> 01:54:14,335
In ways you cannot yet realize.

1192
01:54:15,702 --> 01:54:18,207
How'd you persuade him to
keep your secret?

1193
01:54:18,208 --> 01:54:21,497
He inferred that universe
ending paradoxes would ensue

1194
01:54:21,498 --> 01:54:23,168
should he break his promise.

1195
01:54:23,169 --> 01:54:24,940
You lied?

1196
01:54:25,838 --> 01:54:28,966
- Oh. I implied.
- A gamble?

1197
01:54:28,967 --> 01:54:30,831
An act of faith.

1198
01:54:30,832 --> 01:54:34,390
One I hope you will repeat in
the future in Starfleet.

1199
01:54:34,583 --> 01:54:37,893
In the face of extinction it is only
logical I resign my Starfleet commission

1200
01:54:37,894 --> 01:54:39,100
and help rebuild our race.

1201
01:54:39,101 --> 01:54:41,716
And yet you can be in two places at once.

1202
01:54:42,683 --> 01:54:44,905
I urge you to remain in Starfleet.

1203
01:54:45,719 --> 01:54:49,531
I've already located a suitable planet
on which to establish a Vulcan colony.

1204
01:54:50,019 --> 01:54:53,984
Spock, in this case do yourself a favor

1205
01:54:55,318 --> 01:54:58,858
put aside logic, do what feels right.

1206
01:55:04,753 --> 01:55:08,038
Since my customary farewell
would appear awfully self serving

1207
01:55:08,358 --> 01:55:11,439
I shall simply say good luck.

1208
01:55:23,025 --> 01:55:26,484
This assembly calls captain
James Tiberius Kirk.

1209
01:55:27,317 --> 01:55:30,683
Your inspirational valor and supreme
dedication to your comrades

1210
01:55:30,684 --> 01:55:32,962
is in keeping with the highest
traditions of service.

1211
01:55:33,749 --> 01:55:38,377
And reflect at most credit to yourself,
your crew and the Federation.

1212
01:55:39,498 --> 01:55:42,677
It is my honor to award you
with this commendation.

1213
01:55:46,858 --> 01:55:51,638
By Starfleet order 28455, you are 
hereby directed to report to admiral Pike

1214
01:55:51,876 --> 01:55:55,557
USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.

1215
01:56:03,767 --> 01:56:05,341
I relieve you, sir.

1216
01:56:06,010 --> 01:56:08,082
I am relieved.

1217
01:56:09,746 --> 01:56:12,380
- Thank you, sir.
- Congratulations, captain.

1218
01:56:14,167 --> 01:56:16,337
