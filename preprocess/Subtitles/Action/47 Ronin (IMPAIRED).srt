00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:49,966
NARRATOR: <i>Ancient feudal Japan,
a land shrouded in mystery,</i>

2
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,968
<i>forbidden to foreigners.</i>

3
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,847
<i>A group of magical islands
home to witches and demons.</i>

4
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,975
<i>A nation of rival provinces</i>

5
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:03,480
<i>whose lords were ruled by a
shogun whose will is absolute.</i>

6
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,318
<i>Peace in the realm is
kept by the samurai,</i>

7
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,403
<i>master swordsmen</i>

8
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,322
<i>tasked with protecting their lord</i>

9
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,449
<i>and their province at all costs.</i>

10
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,578
<i>Should a samurai ever
lose or fail his master,</i>

11
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,791
<i>he suffers the greatest shame
in all Japanese society.</i>

12
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,001
<i>He becomes a ronin.</i>

13
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,631
<i>And yet, to know the
story of the 47 Ronin,</i>

14
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,217
<i>is to know the story of all Japan.</i>

15
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,681
<i>It began with a boy.</i>

16
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:43,812
<i>No one knew where he came from
or how he found his way to Ako.</i>

17
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,982
<i>Some said he was a changeling,
no better than a beast.</i>

18
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,073
<i>Many believed he'd been
raised by the Tengu,</i>

19
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,868
<i>the demons of the forest</i>

20
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,038
<i>who had taught him
their dark powers</i>

21
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:04,374
<i>and trained him in their
lethal arts of killing.</i>

22
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,382
<i>The evil he had fled had
left its mark upon him.</i>

23
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,481
Oishi!

24
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,443
My Lord, it is a demon.

25
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,207
He's a child, just like you.

26
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,003
Help me pick him up, Oishi.

27
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,591
NARRATOR:
<i>Lord Asano, of the province Ako,</i>

28
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,177
<i>saved him that day,</i>

29
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,930
<i>seeing something in the
boy that Oishi did not.</i>

30
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,774
<i>Lord Asano's daughter,
Mika, saw it too.</i>

31
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,294
<i>Mika's father allowed the
boy to live amongst them,</i>

32
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,421
<i>against the advice of his samurai.</i>

33
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,884
Look.

34
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,303
What do you see?

35
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,013
A branch?

36
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,765
No.

37
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,976
It's a deer.

38
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,689
- Oh.
- It took this path.

39
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,328
You keep it, Kai.

40
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,580
NARRATOR:
<i>The samurai believed his presence</i>

41
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,708
<i>would bring misfortune
to their land.</i>

42
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,421
<i>Mika only saw a gentle boy.</i>

43
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,967
<i>Although he lived as an outcast,</i>

44
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,177
<i>Kai was determined
to repay the love</i>

45
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,847
<i>he received from
Mika and her father,</i>

46
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,223
<i>whatever the cost.</i>

47
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,240
OISHI: Kai.

48
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,122
Well?

49
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,969
There is something wrong
with the creature.

50
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:55,003
It's up there on the rise, but
it will come down again to hunt.

51
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,714
It would be safer to set a
trap and wait for it here.

52
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,099
It's up on the rise, Lord Asano.

My Lord.

56
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,156
Kill it!

I would rather have been killed by
that beast than saved by a half-breed.

(HORSES APPROACHING)

64
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,039
SAMURAI: Yasuno!

65
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,811
Ako owes you a great debt, Yasuno.

66
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,398
We can finally welcome
the Shogun without fear.

67
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,288
For Ako!

68
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,915
ALL: For Ako!

69
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,376
Well done.

70
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,854
(HORSES RETREATING)

71
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:35,719
Get out.

72
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,140
Get out!

73
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,580
Does Lord Asano live?

74
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,751
Yes.

75
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,336
Mmm.

76
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,771
MIKA:
Hosting the Shogun's tournament

77
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,606
is a great honor for my father.

78
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,399
Everything must be perfect.

79
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,610
My Lady, Mika.

80
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,363
Lord Asano and the hunting
party have returned.

81
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,281
They killed the beast.

82
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,710
(ALL MURMURING)

83
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,715
Father!

84
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,469
I was worried.

85
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,971
The hunt took longer than we hoped.

86
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,016
Yasuno showed great courage.

87
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,561
Is anyone badly hurt?

88
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,691
Who are you looking for?

89
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,033
Is everything prepared
for the Shogun's arrival?

90
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,994
Yes, Father.

91
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,668
LORD ASANO: I want all of
Ako to share in this honor

92
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,421
of hosting our great commander.

93
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,401
MIKA:
I have made special arrangements

94
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,174
for the visiting lords, as well.

95
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,892
I've ordered stands put
up all along the route.

96
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,855
Your mother would have been proud.

97
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,193
(WOOD STRIKING)

98
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,291
I was worried.

99
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,294
You always worry.

100
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,301
RIKU: He so wants your approval.

101
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,221
Chikara has been training
every chance he gets.

102
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,445
My Lady, Kai has returned.

103
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,938
They told me you were hurt.

104
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:16,981
It's nothing, My Lady.

105
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,528
Your back.

106
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,533
Sit down.

107
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,625
Someone should have
seen to this before.

108
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,804
Thank you.

109
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,441
I saw the shame in Yasuno's eyes
when they were praising him.

110
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,446
Even when you try to help
them, they hate you.

111
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,992
Your father's samurai have always
treated me as well as can be expected.

112
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,536
And is that all you expect?

113
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,540
It's all I know.

114
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,211
It doesn't have to be, Kai.

115
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,182
This is no place for you, My Lady.

116
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,518
Are you sending me away?

117
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,941
Look at me and tell
me you don't love me.

118
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,360
I will always love you.

119
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,529
But you have your place

120
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,324
and I have mine.

121
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,729
Asano <i>Takumi no Kami,</i> ruler of Ako.

122
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,940
His Highness, Shogun Tokugawa,

123
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:07,736
lord of provinces and
master of all Japan

124
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,613
thanks you for your welcome.

125
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,574
Lord Asano,

126
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,285
my friend.

127
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,787
Ako is magnificent,

128
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,664
as always.

129
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,462
We anticipate with pleasure
tomorrow's tournament.

130
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,424
LORD ASANO:
Great Shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi...

131
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,442
and hope the entertainment
we have prepared

132
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,486
meets your august approval.

133
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,657
Father.

134
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,827
What are you doing in my home?

135
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:01,247
Last week at the hunt I saw a fox.

136
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,001
I didn't realize at the
time that it was a witch.

137
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,878
A witch?

138
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,839
I believe I saw the same
creature again tonight.

139
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:13,009
She was in human form among
the nobles' concubines.

140
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:16,471
My Lord.

141
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,522
They say only demons have the power

142
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,149
to see past a witch's disguise.

143
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,696
Are you a demon?

144
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,782
No.

145
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,913
Then I suggest you are simply
bewitched by a beautiful girl.

146
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:59,264
ADJUTANT: Lord Asano, may we
present Lord Kira Yoshinaka,

147
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:02,600
master of Nagato, from
the northern provinces.

148
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:19,367
Ako is as beautiful as I
remember, Lord Asano.

149
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,620
We are honored by your
visit, Lord Kira.

150
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,667
I look forward to the tournament.

151
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:44,684
I had no idea your concubine
was so lovely, Lord Asano.

152
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,853
She's my daughter.

153
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:51,358
LORD KIRA: Oh.

154
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,443
Forgive me, My Lady.

155
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,031
May I ask that your
daughter sit with us?

156
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,242
I should like to make
up for my rudeness.

160
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,943
Father, who is that?

161
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,239
My fighter.

162
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,082
I'm sure your father's champion
will be an even contest.

163
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,502
Yasuno.

164

165
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,593

The law is clear.

228

You have struck an unarmed guest
and have shamed your home.

229
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:12,122
The penalty is death.

230
00:31:13,415 --> 00:31:17,252
Because of your rank and the
service you have done Ako,

231
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,631
I will allow you to regain your

me hanged like a criminal.

Your Highness, as my

270
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:29,582
I ask that I may look after his

271
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,752
I have already considered
this, My Lady.

So that there will be no
feud between your clans,

You are granted one year to mourn.

277
00:37:59,237 --> 00:38:03,658
But you will remain a guest of
Lord Kira's until you are married.

I leave Ako with you.

From this moment on, you are
banished from these lands.

285
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:51,247
Those who remain
will be hunted down

When Kira took her away,
you were on your knees.

been killed. You too.

The main gate here

392

and this point beneath
the west wall.

393
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:34,172
Both are heavily guarded.

394
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:38,802
Our best chance is to strike when Kira
leaves the safety of his fortress.

395
00:53:38,968 --> 00:53:42,972
He will travel to his ancestors'
shrine to offer prayers.

396
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:45,934
We don't know yet when he
will make the journey.

to his temple town

398

Remember, even near holy sites

400
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:58,655
there are brothels and plenty of
loose-tongued officials who visit them.

401
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:03,284
Even if we know the route, we
will need more men for an ambush.

402
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:05,328
Then we'll get them.

and meet us here at a farmhouse
Horibe has found for us.

You will find nothing in Hida.

to protect themselves
and their beliefs.

They wanted to show me that this
life has nothing to offer but death.

01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:07,657
You told him not to draw his sword.

499
01:05:09,367 --> 01:05:10,994
If he does,

500
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:15,206
he and all his men will die.

501
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:22,839
Was it worth it? What you
found in the outside world?

502
01:05:23,673 --> 01:05:27,635
The love of a woman
you can never have?

503
01:05:28,636 --> 01:05:29,637
Yes.

504
01:05:32,849 --> 01:05:35,393
Let me tell you of love, Kai.

505
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:37,562
The love of one night

506
01:05:38,188 --> 01:05:40,106
that brought you into this world.

507
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:45,362
An English sailor
and a peasant girl.

508
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:51,868
Your loving mother abandoned
you to die in these woods.

509
01:05:52,035 --> 01:05:55,372
A monster, a half-breed child.

510
01:05:56,998 --> 01:05:58,833
Yet we found you,

511
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,962
accepted you, trained you.

512
01:06:05,674 --> 01:06:07,509
We taught you many things.

513
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:10,387
But you fled

514
01:06:10,595 --> 01:06:13,640
and you turned your
back on those gifts.

515
01:06:14,557 --> 01:06:16,142
Gifts of death.

516
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:17,769
No matter what you do,

517
01:06:19,187 --> 01:06:22,399
Mika will never be
yours in this life.

518
01:06:24,526 --> 01:06:28,488
Then I will go to my death and
pray I find her in the next.

519
01:06:31,116 --> 01:06:32,117
YASUNO: Sir?

520
01:06:38,832 --> 01:06:40,625
What are you doing here?

521
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:42,919
I told you to stay.

522
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:52,887
No! Yasuno!

523
01:07:02,647 --> 01:07:04,482
TENGU LORD: <i>Draw your sword.</i>

524
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:10,488
<i>Save them.</i>

525
01:07:11,614 --> 01:07:13,116
<i>Draw your sword.</i>

526
01:07:15,577 --> 01:07:16,828
<i>Save them.</i>

527
01:07:19,873 --> 01:07:20,957
<i>Draw your sword.</i>

528
01:07:25,086 --> 01:07:26,254
<i>Save your men!</i>

529
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:33,553
No more talk.

530
01:07:35,096 --> 01:07:37,223
Will you give me what I ask?

531
01:07:38,975 --> 01:07:40,477
Take the blade, Kai.

532
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:42,645
If you can reach it before me.

533
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:48,943
<i>Save your men. Help them.</i>

534
01:07:58,953 --> 01:08:00,872
<i>Draw your sword, Oishi.</i>

535
01:08:05,126 --> 01:08:06,127
<i>Save them.</i>

536
01:08:13,009 --> 01:08:14,010
Chikara!

537
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:28,024
A gift not forgotten.

538
01:08:47,877 --> 01:08:50,046
KAI: You passed their test.

539
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:51,881
Your men are safe.

540
01:08:52,882 --> 01:08:54,759
You've got your swords.

541
01:09:08,481 --> 01:09:11,234
BASHO: What's so special
about these swords?

542
01:09:11,401 --> 01:09:13,069
What do they do?

543
01:09:14,821 --> 01:09:16,072
It depends.

544
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:17,991
On what?

545
01:09:19,409 --> 01:09:20,577
Who uses them.

546
01:09:21,703 --> 01:09:27,751
What about a tall, strong,
brave man like me?

547
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:36,509
They cut.

548
01:09:50,106 --> 01:09:51,483
(MEN LAUGHING)

549
01:09:53,902 --> 01:09:55,737
I think mine is broken.

550
01:10:20,553 --> 01:10:21,554
Your sword.

551
01:10:21,763 --> 01:10:24,724
You keep it, Hazama.
I told you we'd bring others.

552
01:10:39,364 --> 01:10:41,032
I have the information
you requested.

553
01:10:41,491 --> 01:10:44,661
Lord Kira leaves for his
ancestors' shrine tonight.

554
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:47,831
Well done.

555
01:10:47,997 --> 01:10:50,709
Come, Isogai. Gather the men.

556
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:52,669
CHIKARA: Father.

557
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:56,047
I want to go with you.

558
01:10:56,881 --> 01:10:57,882
No.

559
01:10:58,425 --> 01:11:00,427
Horibe, stay with him.

560
01:11:33,084 --> 01:11:37,047
I ride to my ancestors' shrine
to offer thanks for our wedding.

561
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:39,841
Is there anything you
wish me to pray for?

562
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:43,345
My Lord will not like my answer.

563
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:46,222
You may look down on me, My Lady,

564
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:50,393
but our children and their
children will be of one blood.

565
01:12:15,627 --> 01:12:17,170

01:12:45,532 --> 01:12:46,908

- No!
- Oishi!

(YELLS)

580
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:31,054
It belonged to Oishi, My Lord.

581
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:49,406
Your half-breed is dead.

582
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:57,372
So are dozens of your father's men.

583
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:01,292
All killed

584
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:03,712
trying to save you.

585
01:15:07,507 --> 01:15:11,636
Perhaps now you understand

586
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:14,597
the price of your love.

587
01:15:20,311 --> 01:15:22,605
I promised my lord

588
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:26,776
I would not harm

589
01:15:27,819 --> 01:15:30,405
a hair on your head.

590
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:40,957
But what you do to yourself

591
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:44,878
is not my concern.

592
01:16:03,688 --> 01:16:05,315
Good night.

593
01:16:57,534 --> 01:16:58,827
BASHO: Kai.

594
01:16:59,869 --> 01:17:02,622
I have a confession to make.

595
01:17:04,207 --> 01:17:06,209
When I was a boy,

596
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:10,422
I used to wait in the
woods outside your hut,

597
01:17:12,215 --> 01:17:14,426
and when you came out,

598
01:17:15,635 --> 01:17:18,888
I'd throw stones at you,

599
01:17:19,222 --> 01:17:21,224
then hide.

600
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:26,896
I knew it was you.

601
01:17:27,772 --> 01:17:30,900
I could see your belly sticking
out from behind the trees.

602
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,695
(GRUNTING)

603
01:17:42,412 --> 01:17:43,747
I'm sorry, Kai.

604
01:17:44,956 --> 01:17:46,958
You're a good man.

605
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:18,990
I should have acted the
day Lord Asano died.

606
01:18:20,658 --> 01:18:23,536
Our anger should have
been sudden and swift.

607
01:18:25,538 --> 01:18:27,957
Then even if we'd failed,

608
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:33,296
it would have been with honor.

609
01:18:46,309 --> 01:18:47,811
You are samurai.

610
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:53,566
We still have swords and
the advantage of surprise.

611
01:18:55,151 --> 01:18:57,362
Kira thinks we're ghosts.

612
01:18:58,488 --> 01:19:01,449
We can use that,
turn it to our advantage.

613
01:19:03,118 --> 01:19:04,786
He'll never expect us.

614
01:19:06,996 --> 01:19:10,000
We can still do what we came for.

615
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:34,691
Eat.

616
01:19:36,901 --> 01:19:38,778
- Your arm?
- YASUNO: Fine.

We are not some village troupe
to be held up by bandits.

622
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:28,745
Lord Kira himself has hired us
to perform at his wedding.

623
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:32,040
I have the letters and
passes to prove it.

624
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:33,249
There is no need.

625
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:36,211
We saw you perform in Ako.

626
01:20:39,714 --> 01:20:41,758
You are Lord Asano's men.

627
01:20:43,927 --> 01:20:45,470
We need your help.

628

YASUNO: Kai.

629
01:21:01,528 --> 01:21:04,781
Forgive me for not thanking
you for defeating the beast

630
01:21:04,864 --> 01:21:06,074
and saving my life.

Stay there!

672
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:14,511
I knew you'd come for me.

673
01:33:15,053 --> 01:33:17,389
Nothing will ever keep
me away from you.

674
01:33:38,201 --> 01:33:40,370
Nothing, half-breed?

675
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,206
Even death?

676
01:33:43,957 --> 01:33:45,166
I know what you are.

677
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:47,210
You have no idea.

678
01:33:48,378 --> 01:33:49,921
I'm not afraid of you.

679
01:33:51,047 --> 01:33:52,507
You should be.

For Lord Asano!

689
01:40:04,546 --> 01:40:05,755
Chikara.

690
01:40:46,921 --> 01:40:48,923
Rest now, My Lord.

691
01:40:50,633 --> 01:40:52,427
You are avenged.

SHOGUN TSUNAYOSHI: <i>Oishi,</i>

693
01:41:02,645 --> 01:41:06,191
I gave you a command forbidding
you to take revenge.

694
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:09,361
Forgive me, Your Highness,

695
01:41:11,404 --> 01:41:15,784
but a man may not live
under the same heaven

696
01:41:16,993 --> 01:41:19,329
as the murderer of his lord.

697
01:41:22,957 --> 01:41:26,711
All I ask is respect for my men.

698
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:30,965
They are brave, My Lord.

699
01:41:33,009 --> 01:41:34,511
The bravest I know.

700
01:41:39,974 --> 01:41:42,268
I beg you to let them die

701
01:41:43,269 --> 01:41:45,021
with the dignity they deserve.

702
01:41:52,737 --> 01:41:54,948
For the crime of disobedience,

703
01:41:56,783 --> 01:42:00,412
you should all be executed
as common criminals.

704
01:42:02,956 --> 01:42:04,708
But you and your men

705
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:07,794
followed the old ways of Bushido

706
01:42:09,462 --> 01:42:10,714
to honor your lord

707
01:42:11,256 --> 01:42:13,341
and to avenge treachery.

708
01:42:21,224 --> 01:42:23,810
I see only samurai before me.

709
01:42:25,645 --> 01:42:28,606
I grant you a samurai's death,

710
01:42:30,066 --> 01:42:32,068
to be buried alongside your lord

711
01:42:33,486 --> 01:42:34,946
with honor.

712
01:42:36,614 --> 01:42:40,744
Thank you, Your Highness.

713
01:43:00,680 --> 01:43:03,350
Lady Asano is like her father.

714
01:43:07,645 --> 01:43:11,608
She will make Ako great again.

715
01:43:14,444 --> 01:43:15,528
Yes.

716
01:43:17,405 --> 01:43:18,448
I know.

717
01:43:56,111 --> 01:43:57,946
My father told me

718
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,826
this world was only a
preparation for the next,

719
01:44:05,036 --> 01:44:10,291
that all we can ask is that
we leave it having loved

720
01:44:10,458 --> 01:44:11,835
and being loved.

721
01:44:16,464 --> 01:44:20,301
I will search for you
through 1,000 worlds

722
01:44:21,386 --> 01:44:25,056
and 10,000 lifetimes
until I find you.

723
01:44:28,101 --> 01:44:30,812
I will wait for you in all of them.

724
01:45:22,989 --> 01:45:24,240
Wait!

725
01:45:27,494 --> 01:45:29,079
Chikara,

726
01:45:29,704 --> 01:45:30,830
son of Oishi,

727
01:45:31,498 --> 01:45:33,291
step out.

728
01:45:52,602 --> 01:45:54,229
Oishi,

729
01:45:55,105 --> 01:45:59,442
I will not deny our
country your bloodline.

730
01:46:00,527 --> 01:46:02,445
Your son shall live

731
01:46:03,863 --> 01:46:05,281
to serve Ako

732
01:46:07,283 --> 01:46:09,828
as you and your samurai have done.
