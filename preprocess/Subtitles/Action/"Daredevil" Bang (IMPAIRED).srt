You ever wake up
in the morning... [sighs]

63
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:25,695
from the second you get out of bed,
it's like...

64
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:27,529
every molecule in your body hurts?

65
00:05:27,612 --> 00:05:29,990
- No, never.
- [sighs] I'm in agony, dude.

66
00:05:30,074 --> 00:05:31,200
What, did you go back to the gym?

67
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:34,661
Hell, no. Do I look capable
of making healthy life choices?

68
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:36,914
I went out, Matthew.
Went out dancing.

69
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:39,499
- I'm choosing not to believe that.
- And yet, it's true.

70
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,376
- Mind if I ask you a personal question?
- Go ahead.

71
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,754
- Are you insane?
- Yes.

72
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:46,966
- Tell me it was the barista.
- [man] Hey, Foggy. Looking good!

73
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:49,176
Her name is Bethany

74
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:50,803
- and she is very limber.
- Oh!

75
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:51,929
You're my hero.

76
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:56,433
- Watch it, asshole.
- So, uh, when's the next date?

77
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:58,602
- Well, therein lies the true pain.
- No!

78
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:01,063
- Yes. One and done.
- [chuckles]

79
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:04,066
End of the night, she hugged me
like a cousin and said, "I'll call you."

80
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:06,193
Oh, that's brutal.

81
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:09,113
- You know what my problem is?
- Well, it ain't the moves.

82
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:10,740
You know I got the moves.

83
00:06:10,823 --> 00:06:12,992
That's the tragedy of you being blind,
you've never seen me dance.

84
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:15,077
Yeah, but I can cite the legends
I heard in law school.

85
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,840
So come on, what is it?
What's the problem?

86
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:20,290
No wingman.
You never come out with me anymore.

87
00:06:20,374 --> 00:06:22,960
Could you imagine
Nelson and Murdock on the dance floor?

88
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:26,588
[chuckles] I can't deny
that does sound epic.

89
00:06:26,671 --> 00:06:27,965
- Then come out with me, Matt.
- All right.

90
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:29,967
Come on, just one time, me and you.

91
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:32,928
What is it?

92
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:35,055
[sighs] You're bleeding.

93
00:06:35,806 --> 00:06:38,768
- Huh. Where?
- Base of the skull.

94
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,687
- [sighs]
- Did you get it?

95
00:06:43,522 --> 00:06:46,066
[sighs] No one's gonna notice,
if that's what you mean.

96
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,234
Thank you.

97
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,112
- [sighs] I hate this.
- We don't need to talk about it.

98
00:06:50,195 --> 00:06:51,864
[Foggy] Good thinking.

99
00:06:51,947 --> 00:06:54,992
You know, Karen's been asking questions.
The cuts, the scrapes, the bruises.

100
00:06:55,075 --> 00:06:57,452
- What do you tell her?
- You have a drinking problem.

101
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,538
[chuckles] That's horrible.

102
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:01,040
Well, it's more plausible than

103
00:07:01,123 --> 00:07:03,667
you put on a devil suit
and beat the shit out of strangers.

104
00:07:04,584 --> 00:07:08,630
[sighs] You know, this whole thing
isn't just your problem anymore.

105
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:11,508
And I'm past worrying
about the broken bones,

106
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:13,761
and finding you beaten into a coma.

107
00:07:13,844 --> 00:07:15,137
[Matt clearing throat]

108
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,891
- What about us?
- Nelson and Murdock?

109
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:21,094
You ever stop to think
what happens if you get caught?

110
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:22,303
At best, you'll be disbarred.

111
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:24,814
Then you'll continue to do
the good work we started together.

112
00:07:24,897 --> 00:07:26,440
Do you even hear yourself?

113
00:07:27,357 --> 00:07:29,985
You're my partner.
I don't wanna continue alone.

114
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:31,236
Foggy...

115
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:37,117
last week, a client came to our office,
Zuly Almeida.

116
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:39,536
Claimed her life was in danger.
We had no legal recourse to offer.

117
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:41,246
I remember.

118
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,623
You recommended an excellent shelter
for battered women.

119
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:45,960
- And she went.
- Yeah, she tried.

120
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:50,130
That night, her husband found out
she wanted to leave him,

121
00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:51,340
and he followed her to the bus stop

122
00:07:51,423 --> 00:07:53,968
with a gut full of beer
and a butcher knife in his hand.

123
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:57,089
- You never told me that.
- Well, I'm telling you now.

124
00:07:58,013 --> 00:07:59,890
Mr. Almeida walked out of his apartment

125
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:04,436
with the intention to hack Mrs. Almeida
into many bloody pieces...

126
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,521
starting by taking off her head.

127
00:08:08,065 --> 00:08:09,358
Guess what?

128
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:10,609
Never happened.

129
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:14,822
Instead, he woke up in a hospital
with two broken arms

130
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:17,867
and a restraining order
safety-pinned to his chest.

131
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,202
- Jesus, Matt.
- [sighs]

132
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:22,662
If I take a night off,
people get hurt.

133
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:24,999
I don't wanna lose you.

134
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:27,835
- You won't.
- Promise me.

135
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,421
[chuckles] You want me to cross my heart?

136
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:34,133
Do not make fun of me.

137
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:36,676
I swear.

138
00:08:38,345 --> 00:08:40,555
- [chuckles]
- Come on. Let's get to work.

139
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,557
Yeah, I gotta get out of this heat.

140
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:44,268
[phone ringing]

141
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:52,317
[man] Idiots.

142
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:56,989
Good morning, guys.
You take the scenic route this morning?

143
00:08:57,072 --> 00:08:59,324
- Morning to you, too.
- [Matt] Morning, Karen.

144
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:00,868
- What have we got?
- All right.

145
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:05,039
[sighs] Well, uh, Mr. Marino's dog
was viciously beaten

146
00:09:05,122 --> 00:09:08,042
by his neighbor
after the dog, um... [clears throat]

147
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:11,253
defiled the neighbor's statue
of Saint Francis.

148
00:09:11,336 --> 00:09:12,671
- "Defiled"?
- Um...

149
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:14,965
humped repeatedly until completion.

150
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:19,094
- That's a dog I want to defend.
- Oh, he's... he's all yours, cowboy.

151
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:22,431
And, uh, Mr. Maxwell here
was attacked in a bar fight last night.

152
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:23,557
He started it.

153
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,851
[Karen] Oh, I... I called Metro-General
and the other guy will recover,

154
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:28,062
but if you are looking at trial,

155
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:30,898
you probably wanna wait
until his jaw is unwired.

156
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:32,774
Your girl's a badass.

157
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:36,111
- [chuckles] You've no idea.
- [phone ringing]

158
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:39,698
Um, and, uh,
Miss Jacinto's working papers

159
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:41,951
have been denied
for the third time.

160
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,411
Her father's gone
and she says that factory work is

161
00:09:44,494 --> 00:09:45,996
the only way she can support her family.

162
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,831
- Well, tell her not to worry.
- Yeah.

163
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:49,624
I've already pulled her applications
from the DOE.

164
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,919
Good, because we're gonna find her
something better.

165
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:54,046
And that's just the appointments
for the first hour.

166
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,048
You wanna talk about our 10:00 a.m.'s?

167
00:09:58,008 --> 00:09:59,134
Uh, what's that?

168
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:01,636
Oh, uh, the bananas are from Mr. Tate.

169
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,348
Payment for that fender bender thing.
And for you...

170
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:06,433
[Foggy whispering] Strawberry rhubarb.

171
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:08,143
You will be mine.

172
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:10,687
Uh, so, um...

173
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:15,067
I installed this free trial
of accounting software on my computer.

174
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,028
And the good news is that
I can re-up it every 30 days

175
00:10:18,112 --> 00:10:20,864
- with a fake email address. But, um...
- [chuckles]

176
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:25,910
the bad news is that...
we're broke.

177
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:30,832
As in, literally no money.
And our income can't cover our bills.

178
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:33,543
We'll manage.

179
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:37,089
[chuckles] I don't know how,
but I know we will.

180
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,135
All right.

181
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:43,470
Well, in the meantime,
I guess we have, um...

182
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:47,432
lots of pastries and...
and fruit. [chuckles]

183
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:48,933
- Yeah, and fans.
- [Karen chuckles]

184
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:50,644
- Portable, electric fans.
- Yes.

185
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:54,314
And, uh...
and each other.

186
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,990
[Foggy] Miss Jacinto,
will you come in, please?

187
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:02,947
Let's see if we can find you a better way
to live in Hell's Kitchen.

188
00:11:03,032 --> 00:11:04,449
Please, sit down.

189
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:28,307
[dogs barking]

190
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:44,823
[dog barking]

191
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:50,287
Apologies, Mr. Nesbitt.
Blood's still up.

192
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:53,248
- Best you mind him, Thomas.
- [dog barking]

193
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,709
[Thomas] You miserable mutt!

194
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:58,044
Where was all that fight 10 minutes ago?

195
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:03,133
[dog whimpering]

196
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,888
[indistinct conversations]

197
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:17,647
Place smells like dog shit!

198
00:12:17,731 --> 00:12:19,441
There's a pot calling the kettle.

199
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:21,568
[chuckles]

200
00:12:23,695 --> 00:12:25,530
Someone get this poor man a drink.

201
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:32,078
Grotto, you mangy shite.
How's the view up Nesbitt's ass?

202
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:41,130
Gentlemen, if you'll permit me...

203
00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:43,882
a word before we begin.

204
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,345
This is a night for celebration.

205
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:54,058
A night to discuss
the future of our family...

206
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:58,480
the gratitude we feel
for the support of his father.

207
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:02,484
But perhaps as important...

208
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:08,072
it is also...
a moment for sober reflection.

209
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:10,700
[scoffs] Sober, my ass.

210
00:13:16,873 --> 00:13:20,669
Two hundred years ago, our people
were little more than dirt farmers,

211
00:13:20,752 --> 00:13:22,962
struggling just to survive.

212
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:26,508
They had nothing
but their hopes and their fists,

213
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:29,344
and they brought both of them along
when they came to America,

214
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:31,054
many to this very city.

215
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:32,722
Think you've had enough, George.

216
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:38,853
Now some of you are young...

217
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:41,815
so there's no reason you'd remember,

218
00:13:41,898 --> 00:13:48,280
but there was a time
when the Irish owned Hell's Kitchen.

219
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:52,742
Wasn't a mother's son could
make a move without giving us our due,

220
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:57,872
and any sorry shite dull enough
to cross us paid a heavy price.

221
00:13:57,956 --> 00:14:01,210
We had the cops, judges, councilmen.

222
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:04,504
We had the whole bloody city
at our beck and call.

223
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,717
But we got complacent.

224
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,761
[breathes heavily]
Lost our edge.

225
00:14:11,845 --> 00:14:14,556
Just enough for a piece of garbage
like Wilson Fisk

226
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,016
- to steal what was rightfully ours.
- [men agreeing]

227
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:22,021
[footsteps approaching]

228
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:24,774
[siren wailing in distance]

229
00:14:32,866 --> 00:14:34,784
- [man] That's right.
- [men agreeing]

230
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:36,245
Some of us feared Fisk.

231
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:39,289
Some, in fact, ran.

232
00:14:39,998 --> 00:14:41,250
A few...

233
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:44,544
maybe even deigned to work for him.

234
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:47,631
Siding against their own kind.

235
00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:56,055
But now the Devil's taken him down,

236
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:59,851
and that, gentlemen, has provided us
with a singular opportunity.

237
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:01,436
The Russians are dead.

238
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:04,564
The Chinese, they turned tail and ran,

239
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:07,942
leaving the drug trade
ripe for the taking.

240
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:09,778
The yakuza have gone silent.

241
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:12,406
- Piss on 'em!
- Piss on 'em all!

242
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:15,199
- Piss on 'em all.
- 'Cause this is our time!

243
00:15:16,451 --> 00:15:18,245
Anyone crosses us,

244
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:20,372
we'll paint the streets red
with their blood.

245
00:15:20,455 --> 00:15:22,874
And when they're gone,
we'll make your father proud,

246
00:15:22,957 --> 00:15:27,379
and purge ourselves of the filthy traitors
who betrayed their own kind

247
00:15:27,462 --> 00:15:30,424
and make Hell's Kitchen ours again!

248
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:32,050
[gunshots]

249
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:33,927
- [men shouting]
- [glass shattering]

250
00:15:35,304 --> 00:15:36,305
[grunting]

251
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,521
[grunts]

252
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:03,039
[groaning]

253
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:10,213
[grunts]

254
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:25,604
[breath trembling]

255
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:36,365
[groaning]

256
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:38,992
[grunts]

257
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:46,165
[siren wailing in distance]

258
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:10,732
[Irish jig playing on cell phone]

259
00:17:22,243 --> 00:17:23,912
[glass shatters]

260
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:26,205
[crowd talking indistinctly]

261
00:17:34,172 --> 00:17:37,133
See, I don't know, that definitely
sounded like cheating to me, Miss Page.

262
00:17:37,216 --> 00:17:39,260
[stutters] Foggy, you sure
we're not being hustled here?

263
00:17:39,343 --> 00:17:41,555
- As sure as Josie's AC is busted.
- [chuckles]

264
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:43,139
- What AC?
- [Karen sighs]

265
00:17:43,222 --> 00:17:44,683
At least she brought water.

266
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:46,166
- Oh!
- No, you don't wanna do that.

267
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:48,812
- You can't drink the water here.
- Josie's pipes have issues.

268
00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:50,522
Rust, mold.

269
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:53,274
- [chuckles]
- I think I can actually see the bacteria

270
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:54,526
- floating in there.
- Oh, ew, ew.

271
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:55,902
[Foggy sighs]

272
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:58,029
See, that... that's why we, uh,
keep our cocktails neat.

273
00:17:58,112 --> 00:17:59,781
[Foggy] Pretend you're abroad,

274
00:17:59,864 --> 00:18:01,908
on vacation someplace exotic,
but no mojitos.

275
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:03,034
Josie just throws mint in the beer.

276
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:04,411
- [Matt chuckles] Right.
- Take over, buddy.

277
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:05,495
I gotta hit the head.

278
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:07,997
And don't let her out of
your four working senses.

279
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:10,041
- She's as quick as she is beautiful.
- Right.

280
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:11,418
She reminds me of myself.

281
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,377
[chuckles]

282
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:19,383
Ah, this place brings out something...
special in Foggy

283
00:18:19,468 --> 00:18:21,845
[chuckles] Are you sure
it's not the alcohol?

284
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:24,598
- No, it's the company.
- [both sigh]

285
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:26,224
He likes it when it's the three of us.

286
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:31,480
If it were up to him, we'd be doing this
the rest of our lives. [chuckles]

287
00:18:35,484 --> 00:18:38,361
- [billiard balls clacking]
- God damn it.

288
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:40,822
- What happened?
- [smacks lips] There goes my shutout.

289
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:43,366
Um, you're going for a shutout
against a blind man?

290
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,826
[both chuckling]

291
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:46,244
How do you sleep at night, Miss Page?

292
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:48,622
You don't get any sympathy
from me, Murdock.

293
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:51,040
I'm still not sure
who's hustling who here.

294
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:53,251
All right. [clears throat]

295
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:54,377
Here's your cue.

296
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:57,839
All right,
you're lined up with the cue ball.

297
00:18:57,922 --> 00:19:00,884
Six is at your two,
pocket straightaway.

298
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:02,677
Six and pocket two.

299
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:05,304
[Karen] Mmm-hmm.

300
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:06,973
Fire away.

301
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:13,772
- How'd I do?
- Well, you've got potential.

302
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:15,857
- All right.
- Here, go again.

303
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:30,079
Six ball. [clears throat]

304
00:19:30,163 --> 00:19:31,623
Straight ahead. Just...

305
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,585
- real soft.
- [heart beating rapidly]

306
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,886
Come on, you've done this before.
Just go for it.

307
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:49,182
No!

308
00:19:49,265 --> 00:19:50,809
That good, huh?

309
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:54,103
- Sunk the eight ball. [chuckles]
- Well, something went in.

310
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:57,440
I'll tell you what.
You boys re-rack, I will, uh,

311
00:19:57,524 --> 00:19:59,025
buy rounds for the rematch.

312
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,491
- I leave you two alone for one minute...
- She wanted to teach me.

313
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:10,078
What?

314
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,334
- Show off.
- [chuckles]

315
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:20,379
[heart beating rapidly]

316
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:33,810
Hey, Foggy.

317
00:20:33,893 --> 00:20:37,731
The guy at the bar looking this way,
you know him?

318
00:20:37,814 --> 00:20:39,774
No.
Why? What's his deal?

319
00:20:43,027 --> 00:20:44,153
Adrenaline's high.

320
00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:47,574
His heart rate's out of control.

321
00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:49,951
Well, he is sitting next to Karen.

322
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:52,245
There's something in his coat.

323
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:55,164
Coat? Hot room.

324
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:57,792
I don't need fancy senses
to know he's probably packing.

325
00:20:57,876 --> 00:21:00,879
What? Matt, don't make a thing.
Half the people in here are carrying guns.

326
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:03,798
Yeah, but none of them
have their finger tapping the trigger.

327
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:06,300
Thanks, Jos. [sighs]

328
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,437
You, uh, new here, friend?

329
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:22,316
- No, actually.
- Hey, it's all right.

330
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,861
Look, I'm just... I'm just
letting you know, this is a good place

331
00:21:24,944 --> 00:21:26,445
with good people.

332
00:21:27,363 --> 00:21:29,240
A lot of places
a guy like you could drink.

333
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:31,743
Just saying.

334
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:34,788
It's not what you think.
I got business here.

335
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:36,372
With Nelson and Murdock.

336
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,501
You must be the blind one.

337
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:47,508
Fifteen men, tough Irish.
Armed.

338
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:50,011
All of them blown away.

339
00:21:50,094 --> 00:21:51,512
It was a massacre.

340
00:21:53,597 --> 00:21:56,851
We weren't hit by any rival family there.
I'm telling you, we were...

341
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:58,144
hit by an army.

342
00:21:59,896 --> 00:22:02,148
[Foggy] That's quite the story.
[Grotto] It's a fact.

343
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:03,983
And believe me,
you can go see for yourself.

344
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,152
Burren Club, 47th and 10th.
Can't miss it.

345
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:10,073
It's the... part of New York
that looks like a goddamn war zone.

346
00:22:11,532 --> 00:22:14,035
What's your involvement
in their organization?

347
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,081
- Who's she?
- Answer the question.

348
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,960
Brannigan. [sighs]

349
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:24,503
I've run with them for a long time.
I don't deny it.

350
00:22:25,171 --> 00:22:28,049
Pick-ups, drop-offs,
sometimes doing things I...

351
00:22:28,132 --> 00:22:29,884
shouldn't be.

352
00:22:29,968 --> 00:22:32,511
No question, I'm...
I'm no choir boy.

353
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:35,264
I'm tellin' ya, I just skirt the surface.

354
00:22:36,515 --> 00:22:38,852
Unlike the men I work for,

355
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:41,062
- and the guys that did this.
- [heart beating steadily]

356
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:44,107
I'm telling ya, I had nothing
to do with that massacre.

357
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:52,288
Assuming you're correct
and the Irish were hit

358
00:22:52,323 --> 00:22:54,450
by a powerful crime syndicate tonight...

359
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:57,871
if you're the only one who survived,

360
00:22:57,954 --> 00:23:00,664
your good fortune's gonna rub
some dangerous people the wrong way.

361
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:01,958
No shit!

362
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,878
I got a pack of killers
gunning for my men. [chuckles]

363
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:06,838
My people think I'm a traitor or a rat.

364
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:09,799
So, what can Nelson and Murdock
do for you, Mister...

365
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:12,969
- I'm Grotto.
- Grotto what?

366
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,346
Just Grotto.

367
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:18,516
Witness protection.

368
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,059
You guys need to get me
the hell out of here

369
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:22,854
before I end up in the only place
hotter than this...

370
00:23:23,354 --> 00:23:25,231
- permanent.
- [Matt] We're a private law firm.

371
00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:27,608
Yeah, a trustworthy one.

372
00:23:28,317 --> 00:23:30,403
Quite a reputation
after you took out Wilson Fisk.

373
00:23:30,486 --> 00:23:32,864
The DA's office is the only place
that can make a deal.

374
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:35,107
Yeah, I'm not walking to the DA
without representation.

375
00:23:35,158 --> 00:23:36,492
I know a lot.
I seen a lot.

376
00:23:38,661 --> 00:23:41,873
I'll give the cops anything
to get me out of Hell's Kitchen.

377
00:23:42,748 --> 00:23:44,750
Well, we have a reputation
for representing

378
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:47,170
the good people of Hell's Kitchen,

379
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:49,422
not for negotiating
on behalf of career criminals.

380
00:23:49,505 --> 00:23:51,757
What if a criminal wants to...
change his career?

381
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:54,844
A second chance,
that's all I want.

382
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:56,470
I know I'm only coming here with my word.

383
00:23:56,554 --> 00:23:59,182
I got nobody to vouch for me,
but I can... [sighs]

384
00:23:59,682 --> 00:24:02,101
barely cover your fee.
But word is...

385
00:24:02,185 --> 00:24:04,312
that Nelson and Murdock
put their faith in people.

386
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:06,064
And I need a little of that right now.

387
00:24:08,942 --> 00:24:09,984
Please.

388
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:14,948
[sighs]

389
00:24:15,031 --> 00:24:17,200
Lie low.
We'll look into it.

390
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:18,868
You have somewhere you can stay?

391
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:21,745
[Karen] Jesus.

392
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:24,332
Hey.

393
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:31,005
Guys?

394
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:32,756
Guys, he's bleeding.

395
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:34,550
- Aw, sheesh.
- [cameras clicking]

396
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:37,220
Every time I think we've seen it all...

397
00:24:38,137 --> 00:24:43,767
Hell's Kitchen manages to sneak up
and kick me right in the balls.

398
00:24:44,685 --> 00:24:45,895
[sighs]

399
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:53,152
It's gonna take weeks
to process this shit.

400
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,405
And where's this asshole's hand?

401
00:24:58,782 --> 00:25:00,869
[indistinct radio chatter]

402
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:04,914
[officer 1] Guys, we gotta post stuff now.
[officer 2] We got two.

403
00:25:04,998 --> 00:25:06,290
- You got two?
- Yeah.

404
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:08,417
- All right, you might need additional...
- Right, right, right.

405
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:10,253
We also got forensics on the scene.

406
00:25:11,587 --> 00:25:13,547
[man 1] Hey, I just need to know
if my brother's in there.

407
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:16,217
Step back, please. I'm sorry, sir,
but I can't answer that right now.

408
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,386
Hey, Brett!
Over here, Matt.

409
00:25:21,097 --> 00:25:22,140
[Brett sighs]

410
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:25,059
I would say it's good to see you,
but under the circumstances...

411
00:25:25,143 --> 00:25:28,396
- Would you please step aside, sir?
- We got a couple of questions, Brett.

412
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:32,025
If you're here to chase ambulances,
you might notice there are none.

413
00:25:32,108 --> 00:25:34,708
- Any leads on what happened?
- Oh, you wanna know what went down?

414
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:36,988
Read about it in the papers
like everybody else.

415
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:39,323
We're not everybody else, my man.

416
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:43,161
Did you just say "my man"?

417
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:45,371
[man 2] Uh, label this one six.

418
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:49,918
[man 3] All right, now.
Let's get body bags over here.

419
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:51,085
[detective] Look at this, will you?

420
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:52,378
Now, what kind of bullet
can punch through

421
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:55,965
polyethylene fiber vest
thicker than my dick...

422
00:25:57,091 --> 00:25:59,843
then punch straight through
the same shit on his back?

423
00:26:01,262 --> 00:26:02,596
[Foggy] All right, we get it.

424
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,557
You can't talk about
an active crime scene.

425
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,892
However...
[breathes deeply]

426
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,061
what if...

427
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:10,771
hypothetically speaking...

428
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:13,566
we may have recently acquired
a new client that could help...

429
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,695
[stammers] shed some light
on this investigation?

430
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:20,031
- How recent?
- Farm fresh.

431
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,701
- Was he here?
- Client privilege.

432
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:27,830
Well, uh, Mr. Nelson,
if that was true...

433
00:26:27,913 --> 00:26:28,998
Hypothetically speaking.

434
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:32,210
...I'd tell you that withholding
your client from the NYPD

435
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:34,628
would be obstructing
governmental administration,

436
00:26:34,712 --> 00:26:37,631
and I'd probably just
arrest your ass myself.

437
00:26:37,715 --> 00:26:38,799
In theory.

438
00:26:38,882 --> 00:26:41,094
I guess we really
can't help each other after all.

439
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:43,429
It's over 100 degrees
out here tonight, Sergeant.

440
00:26:44,263 --> 00:26:45,348
Why would an Irish mobster

441
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:48,184
wear body armor to a private meeting
inside his own club?

442
00:26:49,602 --> 00:26:50,603
Hey!

443
00:26:50,686 --> 00:26:53,481
Tell 'em keep it down in there
or somebody's getting written up.

444
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:02,031
I help you...

445
00:27:02,615 --> 00:27:03,949
you help me?

446
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:06,160
That's all we want.

447
00:27:06,244 --> 00:27:09,455
There's a total clampdown
on any of this getting out to the press.

448
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:11,374
- I'd like to keep it that way.
- Brett...

449
00:27:11,457 --> 00:27:14,043
[chuckles] you can trust us.

450
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:15,253
- We're lawyers.
- [chuckles]

451
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:19,757
- [sighs] Come with me over here.
- [helicopter whirring]

452
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:21,759
[whispers] Come on.

453
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:32,228
DA's going bat shit
trying to figure it out.

454
00:27:34,438 --> 00:27:36,899
This isn't the first hit
that matches this MO.

455
00:27:36,982 --> 00:27:40,153
Call it massive gang-on-gang overkill.

456
00:27:40,236 --> 00:27:42,596
Downtown office thinks we got
new players in Hell's Kitchen,

457
00:27:42,655 --> 00:27:47,035
and whoever they are, we're talking some
kind of paramilitary-type organization

458
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:50,371
with the training, knowledge and hardware
to take out half the city.

459
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:52,706
- What do they want?
- That's what's driving the DA nuts.

460
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,084
We don't know who they are.

461
00:27:55,168 --> 00:27:56,502
We just know who they're not.

462
00:27:56,585 --> 00:27:58,587
I'd say they're definitely
not fond of the Irish.

463
00:27:58,671 --> 00:28:00,506
[Brett] You think?

464
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:03,801
[man 2] Where exactly
am I gonna put this asshole?

465
00:28:03,884 --> 00:28:05,303
The morgue's completely full.

466
00:28:05,386 --> 00:28:08,097
This is worse than what happened
to the Dogs of Hell.

467
00:28:10,058 --> 00:28:11,475
[Brett] Now, we got history,

468
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:14,228
so I'll tell you as a friend,
you stay out of this shit.

469
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:17,690
If you got a witness, the smart move
is to turn him over and walk away.

470
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:20,276
Hell's Kitchen is about to explode.

471
00:28:23,654 --> 00:28:26,074
You hear that?
He called me friend.

472
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:31,662
What'd you pick up?
Your hearing's better than mine.

473
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:34,332
Whatever happened here happened
to the Dogs of Hell last week.

474
00:28:34,415 --> 00:28:36,792
- The biker gang?
- Yeah.

475
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:39,002
- What are we stepping into?
- I don't know.

476
00:28:40,088 --> 00:28:42,631
I think I can rattle some cages,
see who talks but, uh...

477
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:45,301
Did you even listen to Brett?

478
00:28:45,384 --> 00:28:48,387
We're talking about a squad
of trained killers loose on the streets.

479
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:51,265
Not the kind of guys you challenge
to a fist fight in your underwear.

480
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:54,017
Hey!
It's not underwear, Foggy.

481
00:28:54,935 --> 00:28:56,019
Underwear is comfortable.

482
00:28:56,104 --> 00:28:57,744
- [both chuckle]
- You're a lot of things.

483
00:28:57,771 --> 00:28:59,607
Bulletproof is not one of them.

484
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,443
- I'll see you in the morning.
- You're an asshole.

485
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:04,737
But if I can't stop you,
least I can do is help.

486
00:29:05,654 --> 00:29:08,199
I have a guy I can talk to.
Maybe come back with a few puzzle pieces.

487
00:29:08,282 --> 00:29:10,284
Cool. Just be careful.

488
00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:12,120
[chuckles] You don't get to say that!

489
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:13,787
[EKG beeping steadily]

490
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:24,126
- [Grotto moans]
- [shushes]

491
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:26,592
Okay, okay, okay.
You've got multiple lacerations, Steve.

492
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:27,968
- [coughs]
- All right? The doctor said...

493
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:30,304
- No! No doctor.
- The cut is deep, all right?

494
00:29:30,388 --> 00:29:31,764
Into the muscle,
but there's no vessel damage.

495
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:33,599
Nothing that a few weeks
of physical therapy can't cure.

496
00:29:33,682 --> 00:29:34,892
You need to stay here.

497
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:36,519
- That ain't happening.
- No, I'm here to help you.

498
00:29:36,602 --> 00:29:39,813
[grunts] By hog-tying me to a hospital
with a target on my ass?

499
00:29:39,897 --> 00:29:41,149
You wanna wait for a bullet
through the window

500
00:29:41,232 --> 00:29:43,234
- or pull the trigger myself?
- You need to listen to me, Steve.

501
00:29:43,317 --> 00:29:45,569
- No, you listen to me, you daft woman!
- You can trust me!

502
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:48,406
- Who, in Christ's name, is Steve?
- You are.

503
00:29:49,072 --> 00:29:51,617
Your name is Steve Schaffer,
and I am your wife, Isabelle.

504
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,827
You got into a bar fight
defending my honor.

505
00:29:53,911 --> 00:29:55,621
And other than the beer
that was wasted

506
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:57,290
when that bottle
sliced through your flesh,

507
00:29:57,373 --> 00:30:00,293
I have got no regrets, because I have
loved you since I was 16,

508
00:30:00,376 --> 00:30:03,045
hot Irish temper and all.

509
00:30:03,129 --> 00:30:05,298
[breathing heavily]

510
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:11,429
Nurse actually cried
when I told her that part, by the way.

511
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:15,683
It's a nice story, doll.

512
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,769
You gotta run home now.

513
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,647
You ain't got the balls for what's coming.

514
00:30:24,775 --> 00:30:27,528
Slide into bed, sweetheart,
and settle in.

515
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:30,781
Because I am the best chance
you've got in the world right now.

516
00:30:38,914 --> 00:30:40,040
[groans]

517
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:43,836
[Turk] You got your break-action singles,

518
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,797
your side-by-side,
your over-unders,

519
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,258
and the classic pump-action.

520
00:30:49,342 --> 00:30:53,429
All guaranteed to supersede
every other on the market.

521
00:30:53,512 --> 00:30:54,930
None of these is semis.

522
00:30:55,013 --> 00:30:58,100
Aw, what do you need semis for,
couple bad-asses like you?

523
00:30:58,184 --> 00:31:00,853
Whatever this army is,
they're planting men by the dozen, Turk.

524
00:31:00,936 --> 00:31:02,438
No semis, no deal.

525
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:04,523
Man, I seen you shoot.

526
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:06,692
No semi's gonna
magically make you have good aim.

527
00:31:06,775 --> 00:31:09,820
Saw these off,
spread your blast,

528
00:31:09,903 --> 00:31:12,531
and thank me later,
'cause you ain't no deadeye.

529
00:31:12,615 --> 00:31:13,866
What'd you just say?

530
00:31:14,492 --> 00:31:16,159
- [pipe whooshes]
- [grunts]

531
00:31:17,453 --> 00:31:18,704
Oh, shit.

532
00:31:18,787 --> 00:31:20,122
[screams]

533
00:31:20,623 --> 00:31:21,999

536

Nice duds.
[breathing heavily]

537
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:49,777
The Irish had a whole squad
massacred tonight.

538
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,946
That's a damn shame,
'cause I'm fresh out of sympathy cards.

539
00:31:53,906 --> 00:31:55,949
There's talk about an army in town.

540
00:31:56,742 --> 00:31:59,828
Military grade firepower,
high volume.

541
00:31:59,912 --> 00:32:03,499
- Who's the supplier, Turk?
- You think I know?

542
00:32:03,582 --> 00:32:05,834
Shit like that's so high above
my pay grade...

543
00:32:05,918 --> 00:32:07,085
- [bone crunches]
- [groans]

544
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:08,296
I'm telling you the truth, man.

545
00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:09,797
That tin in my trunk
couldn't kill a rabbit.

546
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,632
- [bone crunches]
- [groans]

547
00:32:11,715 --> 00:32:13,884
Okay, okay!
Okay, listen.

548
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:17,555
I did hear somethin'
from a guy in Rikers.

549
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:18,889
- It's got to do with Fisk.
- [bone crunches]

550
00:32:18,972 --> 00:32:20,599
[screams and whimpers]

551
00:32:20,683 --> 00:32:22,851
- Fisk is gone.
- Yeah,

552
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:26,063
but once you took care of him,
what'd you think was gonna happen?

553
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:29,858
Every gang worth shit's trying
to grab up everything fat boy left behind.

554
00:32:29,942 --> 00:32:32,069
I even heard
the cartel's getting into it.

555
00:32:32,152 --> 00:32:34,655
They're bringing up
some heavy munitions from Juárez.

556
00:32:34,738 --> 00:32:37,157
Military grade.

557
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,951
- Where?
- Warehouse.

558
00:32:39,034 --> 00:32:42,663
Meatpacking District,
13th Street and something,

559
00:32:42,746 --> 00:32:44,707
I swear I'm telling you all I know.

560
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,375

- [bones crunch]
- [screams and groans]

562
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:55,217
Listen, man.

563
00:32:55,301 --> 00:32:57,260
I gave you what you wanted.

564
00:32:57,345 --> 00:32:58,596
My hand's busted,

565
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:01,014
I got all this glass
I gotta replace now.

566
00:33:02,433 --> 00:33:05,143
Maybe, just let a brother go, huh?

567
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,939
Come on, D.

568
00:33:09,022 --> 00:33:11,108
I'm out on parole, man.

569
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:13,736
I can't go back to jail.
Please.

570
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:15,153
I missed Hell's Kitchen.

571
00:33:15,237 --> 00:33:16,447
Yeah.

572
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,824
- It didn't miss you.
- [keys jingle]

[water splashes]

574
00:33:22,035 --> 00:33:23,036
Fine.

575
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,373
Know what?
Be like that.

576
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:29,627
'Cause we both know I'll be back out
by the end of the month...

577
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,169
[groans]

578
00:33:34,256 --> 00:33:35,466
I'll see you then.

[rock music playing]

It's okay, I'm meeting a friend.

[stammers] He's a full-patch member
of the Dogs of Hell.

584
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,947
I swear, I just need to talk to him.

585
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:00,574
What's this big shot's name?

586
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:01,992
Smitty.

587
00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:05,162
Don't move.

588
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:20,218
Does it look like I'm packing?

589
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:22,095
Gonna wish you were.

590
00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:28,310
Come with me.

[man] Look at this asshole.

Says he's here to see Smitty.

595
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,104
Old friend.

596
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:15,273
- Old friend?
- [Foggy] Yeah.

597

Third grade.
Sister Haney's class?

598

She really had it in for us.

599
00:35:20,863 --> 00:35:23,699
Is he around or should I just...
Ow! No, no, no, no!

Never heard of you.

604

[stuttering] I've known Smitty
for a long time.

Oh, yeah? Me, too.

Obviously, we went on different
career paths along the way...

- No.

- No, sir.

with Smitty and then I swear, I'm gone.

Yeah, you're gone now.

I'm gonna get you down.

[Foggy] It was a mistake coming here,
I realize that.

632
00:39:28,443 --> 00:39:30,070
- [man] Shut up!
- I just wanted to help people, I swear.

633
00:39:30,153 --> 00:39:32,530
- Smitty would understand!
- Smitty's dead, asshole.

634
00:39:32,614 --> 00:39:33,824
What?

635
00:39:35,492 --> 00:39:38,245
You have to believe me,
I... I didn't know that.

636
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:39,621
Oh, I believe
there's a lot you don't know.

Smitty was a long time ago.
[breathing heavily]

639
00:39:43,917 --> 00:39:46,086
Couple years ago,
I helped a guy named Foster.

640
00:39:46,169 --> 00:39:47,838
- He was a biker!
- Not one of ours.

641
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:49,381
- Ricky Wex?
- Shut up!

642
00:39:49,464 --> 00:39:50,924
I helped a guy named Pope!

643
00:39:52,009 --> 00:39:55,804
Yeah, the VA said that his injuries
weren't sustained during battle,

644
00:39:55,888 --> 00:39:57,514
but they were!

645
00:39:57,597 --> 00:40:00,392
They just didn't manifest themselves
for 20 years.

646
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:03,395
Uh, we got his operation sorted and then,

647
00:40:03,478 --> 00:40:05,647
a couple of months later,
he was back on his Harley,

648
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:08,817
doing whatever it is you guys do.
Which is none of my business!

649
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:11,779
You helped Pope?

650
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:17,200
Get the hell out of here.

651
00:40:19,077 --> 00:40:20,620
- Really?
- Now!

652
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:27,002
What happened to Smitty?

653
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:31,548
- You serious?
- I came here for a reason.

654
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:33,050
I just need answers!

655
00:40:33,133 --> 00:40:36,719
Look, if I don't get answers,
a lot of innocent blood could be shed.

656
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:40,223
People who both you and I care about
are gonna get hurt.

657
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,475
And you don't seem like
the most sentimental guy,

658
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:44,895
but you're still listening.

659
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:50,108
And that knife isn't in my neck,
so I have to believe that right now...

660
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,987
maybe you and I are on the same side.

661
00:40:55,572 --> 00:40:59,034
[chuckles] You got guts, Harvard.
I'll give you that.

662
00:41:00,452 --> 00:41:04,289
Columbia, actually, but it's not courage.

663
00:41:04,372 --> 00:41:06,083
It's more like sheer adrenaline.

664
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:09,419
Hey, look, I wouldn't be asking,

665
00:41:09,502 --> 00:41:14,091
I wouldn't be here doing this
if it wasn't important.

666
00:41:25,143 --> 00:41:26,686
Smitty was on a run,

667
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:29,898
I-90 with four brothers,
transporting a big score.

668
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:34,194
They were hit by a goddamn army.
Their whole crew was cut to pieces.

669
00:41:34,277 --> 00:41:35,863
Left there like roadkill.

670
00:41:35,946 --> 00:41:38,073
- Any idea who did it?
- Nah.

671
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:41,284
New crew, doesn't matter.
Whoever they are, we're gonna find 'em.

672
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:44,704
And when we do, you wanna be
very far away from the action.

673
00:41:45,705 --> 00:41:48,708
You didn't hear none of this from me.
Now go.

674
00:41:50,418 --> 00:41:51,711
And don't come back.

675
00:42:00,137 --> 00:42:01,763

But I thought I would be dead first.

679
00:42:11,189 --> 00:42:13,150
- I'm gonna get some help.
- No!

680
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:15,652
No... no...

No "they."

690
00:42:48,851 --> 00:42:50,353
Him.

691
00:42:51,729 --> 00:42:53,273
It's one man.
