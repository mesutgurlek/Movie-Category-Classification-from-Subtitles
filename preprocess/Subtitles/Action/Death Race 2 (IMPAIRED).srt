1
00:01:39,206 --> 00:01:41,286
Hey, are you gooks almost done?

2
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,406
Faggot.

3
00:01:58,246 --> 00:02:01,165
- You are big motherfucker, yes?
- Yeah.

4
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,207
Just moments ago, a full-scale riot broke out
at Terminal Island Penitentiary.

5
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:26,927
As far as I can tell,
there has been no action taken

6
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:29,007
by Terminal Island Prison
correction officers.

7
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:30,766
Lock down the bridge,
keep the tower guards.

8
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:33,167
I want everyone else down here now.

9
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,408
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

10
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:48,287
Of course I'm serious!
Patch me live right fucking now!

11
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:51,729
Either you take me live
or I tell your wife everything.

12
00:02:59,729 --> 00:03:00,848
You got that, right?

13
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:49,492
What a shit match.

14
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:53,131
I would never have bet
if I knew Spiro was injured.

15
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:56,251
- But you did, huh?
- Yeah. Take your winnings.

16
00:03:57,332 --> 00:04:00,651
The whole world's falling apart,
and Manchester United with it.

17
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:05,252
When I came over here,

18
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:08,651
that clip was the first thing I ever bought
with my own money, you know?

19
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:12,453
So, you take care of it. You look after it.

20
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,533
Look at you, profiting off football.
He's never watched a match in his life.

21
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:19,132
That's 'cause it's fucking boring, that's why.

22
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:20,612
The world's greatest game.

23
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,452
I think it's the third
world's greatest game, right?

24
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:26,892
What the fuck are you laughing at?

25
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:30,212
Excuse us, please.

26
00:04:36,054 --> 00:04:37,213
About the bank,

27
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:39,813
it's important to me.

28
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:42,213
I know it is.

29
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:44,693
That's why I want to handle it my way,
with my guys.

30
00:04:44,774 --> 00:04:47,533
Well, Vinnie brought me this score.

31
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:51,933
My stipulation is that you're in charge,
which is the way I want it.

32
00:04:52,254 --> 00:04:55,173
- Can I count on you?
- What do you think?

33
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:57,973
Yeah.

34
00:04:58,693 --> 00:05:00,894
I know Vinnie and his boys are a bit green,

35
00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:04,255
but what my nephew lacks in experience,
he makes up for with enthusiasm.

36
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,495
Exactly what I'm worried about.

37
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:09,375
Look, he fucks up, Mr. Kane,
he answers to me, okay?

38
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,095
It's going to be all right, Luke. Trust me.

39
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:15,335
Always do.

40
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,334
I know you do.

41
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:21,415
Come on. I've got something to show you.

42
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:32,256
What do you think?

43
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:34,296
This is for me?

44
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:37,655
- You don't like it?
- I think it's beautiful.

45
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:39,696
I just think, maybe, you know,
based on the kind of work I do,

46
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:42,175
you don't think it's a bit orange?

47
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:44,815
- You don't fucking like it.
- Are you kidding me?

48
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:46,175
She's stunning.

49
00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:51,095
I just wonder, you think I might
stand out in this thing?

50
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:53,615
No, the more obvious you are,
the less suspicious you appear.

51
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:55,856
So, like, hiding in plain sight kind of thing.

52
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:57,536
Precisely.

53
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:00,378
Okay.

54
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:08,617
Don't fuck it up.

55
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:51,457
Thank you both for coming.

56
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:54,739
Mr. Weyland, I'm not exactly sure
why she's here,

57
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,179
but I know why I am, sir. I've failed you
and I've disgraced the corporation.

58
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,619
Relax.

59
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,299
I'm surprised those animals
don't kill each other with more regularity.

60
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,379
You're both here
because this incident has created

61
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,059
a public relations nightmare for me.

62
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:11,139
Was something I said funny?

63
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,700
Well, you had a 48 share.

64
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:19,899
Your network's previous high was a seven.

65
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,740
What you call a nightmare
I'd call a wet dream.

66
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:30,661
Mr. Weyland, I know that the network
isn't your prime moneymaker.

67
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:35,540
But I can't believe that you don't realise
what a gold mine you're sitting on.

68
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:38,302
Humour me, Miss Jones.

69
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:40,581
People are tired of fake violence

70
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:44,181
and fights staged by Vegas promoters.

71
00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:46,901
The hatred that your inmates have

72
00:07:47,782 --> 00:07:51,141
is pure. Can't be duplicated.

73
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:54,581
You're calling what happened today
entertainment?

74
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:55,862
Ah!

75
00:07:58,943 --> 00:08:00,542
What exactly do you have in mind?

76
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,222
VINNIE: No, seriously, I gotta tell you,

77
00:08:05,303 --> 00:08:08,661
this motherfucker's never carried a gun
in 20 years working for my uncle.

78
00:08:08,743 --> 00:08:10,582
- That right, Luke?
Vinnie, pay attention.

79
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:13,062
You got 60 seconds. You get in, you get out.

80
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:15,101
- No one gets hurt.
- We know. Don't worry.

81
00:08:46,263 --> 00:08:48,023
We got company. Get out of there.

82
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:49,224
Vinnie, you copy?

83
00:08:49,304 --> 00:08:51,625
VINNIE: Don't worry about it, man.
Don't stress out.

84
00:08:52,586 --> 00:08:54,546
Look, abort. Get out of there.
- Chill, man.

85
00:08:54,665 --> 00:08:57,105
Jonesy, abort. Abort. Get out of there.

86
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:58,785
- It's under control.
- Fuck.

87
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:09,745
Get the fuck down!
Get the fuck down! Don't look at me!

88
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:11,345
Freeze!

89
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:14,025
- Freeze!
- What the fuck?

90
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:15,905
Hey!

91
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:27,906
Fucking idiot!

92
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:32,586
Twenty years and nobody got hurt.

93
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,387
You. Dumb fuck.

94
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,946
We're leaving now! Move!

95
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:38,867
- Shit!
- Fuck!

96
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:41,426
- Shit! God damn it!
- Go, go, go, man!

97
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:43,026
Come on, let's move!

98
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:44,946
Fuck this, then.

99
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:51,267
What are you looking at? Stop!

100
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:53,067
You're crazy!

101
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,187
- Move!
- OFFICER: Freeze!

102
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,508
Let's get the fuck out of here!

103
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:57,990
Go. Go, go, go, go!

104
00:10:58,071 --> 00:10:59,791
- Get in the fucking car, Vinnie.
- Right.

105
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,230
- Move!
- Gotta go!

106
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,310
VINNIE: What are you doing?
What are you doing?

107
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:14,350
You're going to get us fucking killed,
like Terry.

108
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:19,951
The only motherfucker that got Terry killed
was you. Fucking relax!

109
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,113
We're gonna blast our way through.

110
00:12:04,314 --> 00:12:05,953
No one's getting blasted,
you fucking understand me?

111
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:11,433
They're gaining on us.
Luke, fuck, I ain't getting pinched.

112
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:13,313
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?

113
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:43,915
What the fuck was that for?

114
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,795
- Fuck you.
- Drop the fucking gun.

115
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:48,275
- Make a choice.
- Fuck.

116
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,633
Your uncle is family.

117
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:53,235
It's the only fucking reason
you guys are walking from this. Get out.

118
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:55,075
Get out the fucking car!

119
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:15,396
Chefs from Season 1
are back for redemption.

120
00:13:15,477 --> 00:13:17,036
...and it appears there's even more...

121
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:19,156
...bank robbery suspect
is caught red-handed...

122
00:13:19,237 --> 00:13:21,796
Well, that's still
yet to be confirmed, I'm afraid, Ron,

123
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:24,917
as busy King Street
is starting to get back to normal right now.

124
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:29,397
Just a few hours ago, it was the scene
of high tension as gunfire rang...

125
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:51,117
Ofthe foursuspects,
one has been identified

126
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,198
as Carl Lucas, who is a known associate

127
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,319
- of alleged crime boss Markus Kane.
- Fuck!

128
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:59,598
- We will now take you live downtown...
- Fucking hell!

129
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,118
Fuck!

130
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:55,120
OFFICER 1: Stay where you are!

131
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:02,921
OFFICER 2: Hands up!

132
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:10,882
Take a last look at the mainland, boys.

133
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:13,601
You ain't gonna see her again
once we cross this bridge.

134
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:16,561
Bridges.
Lake Pontchartrain Causeway is the longest,

135
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:18,522
38-and-a-half kilometres long,

136
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:22,041
followed by Donghai Bridge,
32-and-a-half kilometres long.

137
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:26,040
- The King Fahd Causeway comes in third.
- Fucking mumbling, stuttering bastard.

138
00:15:26,923 --> 00:15:29,281
- Could you shut the fuck up?
- Leave him alone.

139
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,402
Prattling on every 10 minutes.

140
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:34,323
- I'm getting sick and fucking tired of you.
- He's scared.

141
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:36,803
What do you care?

142
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:39,322
I don't.

143
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:48,923
All right! Let's move!

144
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:52,803
Get out! Get out!

145
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:56,882
Move! Come on, move!
Get out here! Get out here!

146
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,482
Get the fuck off me.

147
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:01,443
OFFICER: Come on, get out. Come on now.

148
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,487
I will not testify. Never.

149
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,486
The DA's gonna pull his offer, Luke.

150
00:17:22,087 --> 00:17:24,806
Kane'll walk away scot-free,
and you'll go away for life.

151
00:17:25,848 --> 00:17:28,727
You see, I'm not gonna testify
against Markus Kane.

152
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:31,688
Not for immunity, not for money,

153
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:35,927
not for anything.

154
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:46,409
We have some good news, Mr. Kane.
We found Luke.

155
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:49,888
- He's on the Island.
- That is good news.

156
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:52,647
Always knew I could trust that guy.

157
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:56,168
I told you. No way would he betray me.

158
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,690
Have him taken out.

159
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,928
You're joking, right?

160
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,969
So far, he hasn't played ball with the feds.

161
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:12,050
He's in for life. What happens
after a month of hard time, eh?

162
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,050
After a couple of them African apes
have a go at him.

163
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,090
How long do you think
he's gonna stay loyal then?

164
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,609
You know, it's a shame,

165
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,169
'cause I love that guy like a brother.

166
00:18:28,971 --> 00:18:30,330
Anything else?

167
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:31,890
No, sir.

168
00:18:34,372 --> 00:18:36,610
- What else do you want on this?
- It's perfect.

169
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:38,691
- Yeah? Here, then.
- Thank you.

170
00:19:18,614 --> 00:19:19,891
Fuck you!

171
00:19:32,694 --> 00:19:35,092
The average Death Match fight
garners a 50 share.

172
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,694
It peaked two months ago at 62,
but has been on the decline since.

173
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:42,133
The most dangerous fighter is Big Bill,
with a death count of 19,

174
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,414
followed by 14K,

175
00:19:44,134 --> 00:19:46,492
- who, coincidentally, has 14 kills.
- Great, man.

176
00:19:46,974 --> 00:19:48,052
Someone did their homework, right?

177
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:49,973
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

178
00:19:52,294 --> 00:19:55,134
LISTS: That's September Jones.
Former Miss Universe.

179
00:19:55,575 --> 00:19:59,493
Was stripped of her crown after allegations
of a sexual relationship with all five judges.

180
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:01,854
Went to work for Weyland Broadcasting
as a weather girl,

181
00:20:02,055 --> 00:20:04,535
is now the host and executive producer
of Death Match.

182
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:06,175
She grew a...

183
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:09,975
You have a list pretty much ready to go
on anything, don't you?

184
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:16,215
Live from Terminal Island,
television's most violent, most disturbing,

185
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:18,694
and most watched programme
in human history.

186
00:20:19,496 --> 00:20:21,415
Welcome to Death Match.

187
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:27,016
Our first fighter, a murderer serving
four consecutive life sentences,

188
00:20:27,497 --> 00:20:29,975
Xander Grady!

189
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:33,897
Xander,
11 kills, one submission.

190
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:37,495
6'4", 220 pounds.

191
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:42,975
His opponent,
leader of the Terminal Island Triads,

192
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:45,495
he currently ranks second on the kill board,

193
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:49,816
he was Interpol's third most wanted
until his arrest in Los Angeles last year,

194
00:20:50,218 --> 00:20:51,656
14K!

195
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:57,016
14K one submission, 14 kills.

196
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:00,536
5'11", 159 pounds.

197
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:05,057
The combatants are picked by lottery
randomly each week.

198
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:09,337
There are two ways to win.
Kill your opponent, or make him submit.

199
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:12,137
There are several
pressure plates that, when activated,

200
00:21:12,258 --> 00:21:15,097
can give a fighter access
to a variety of weapons.

201
00:21:15,178 --> 00:21:18,178
But they only have 10 seconds
to access them.

202
00:21:18,339 --> 00:21:21,019
If no fighter has won,
both fighters are killed.

203
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:24,138
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.

204
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:35,498
You're number one!

205
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,018
Yo, baby, you're my number one!

206
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,018
Chinese bastard!

207
00:22:11,979 --> 00:22:12,939
Something's not right.

208
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:15,781
What're you talking about?

209
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:21,060
Die!

210
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:12,902
14K! 14K! 14K! 14K!

211
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,663
You want it? Huh?

212
00:23:23,664 --> 00:23:24,904
Let go, man!

213
00:23:26,545 --> 00:23:27,945
I will never give up!

214
00:23:38,024 --> 00:23:39,622
- He quit!
- No!

215
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,664
Another fucking submission!

216
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:44,423
He quit!

217
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:48,145
- 14K! 14K!
Tonight's winner,

218
00:23:49,545 --> 00:23:51,464
14K!

219
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:58,785
Death Match is a trademark
of Weyland International.

220
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:03,105
Fighters are convicted violent felons.
Acts should not be duplicated at home.

221
00:24:10,226 --> 00:24:13,025
Exactly what the fuck
do you think you are doing?

222
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:15,586
You are done.

223
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:16,706
Done!

224
00:24:32,947 --> 00:24:34,306
Lights out!

225
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:51,107
Hey, baby.

226
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:53,427
The numbers from the overnights are in.

227
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:57,707
What do I pay you for?

228
00:24:58,188 --> 00:25:00,788
The ratings are down again. This time, 20%.

229
00:25:01,988 --> 00:25:05,267
Now, you better reverse the trend,
or I'll find someone who can.

230
00:25:06,228 --> 00:25:07,508
Are you sure?

231
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,149
Yes, I'm sure. Now, you make my
motherfucking money. You understand me?

232
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:26,509
LISTS: It's a strict Triad code.

233
00:25:26,949 --> 00:25:30,668
Whoever spills the blood of a Triad,
they're sworn to take that person's life.

234
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:32,628
Xander killed a Triad last match.

235
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:35,028
It defies logic why he wouldn't kill him
if he had the chance.

236
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:37,189
Hey, kid,
I'm not looking for a best friend, okay?

237
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:38,709
So, just leave me alone.

238
00:26:09,392 --> 00:26:10,790
Carl Lucas.

239
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:13,511
- Chill. Chill, man.
Relax.

240
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:16,471
You've been assigned to our work detail.

241
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:17,711
That's Rocco,

242
00:26:18,232 --> 00:26:19,232
I'm Goldberg.

243
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:22,072
- Goldberg, huh?
- Yeah.

244
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:24,631
What are you, like, the...
You, like, the last Mexican Jew, or what?

245
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,831
Yeah. I killed all the rest.

246
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:32,430
Okay. So, this work detail,
what are we looking at?

247
00:26:32,953 --> 00:26:34,552
And don't tell me we're washing underwear.

248
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:36,991
No.
- I don't care what you're into.

249
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:39,032
I'm not washing anybody's underwear.

250
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:43,353
On your feet, Lucas. Warden wants you.

251
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:13,914
That'll be all.

252
00:27:16,314 --> 00:27:20,073
Carl Lucas, arrested 22 times
over a span of 20 years.

253
00:27:20,675 --> 00:27:22,833
But nothing ever stuck,
not a single damn one.

254
00:27:23,995 --> 00:27:25,553
You just slipped through the cracks.

255
00:27:27,554 --> 00:27:28,713
Well, I shot a cop.

256
00:27:29,635 --> 00:27:31,554
Those cracks, they fill up pretty fast.

257
00:27:31,955 --> 00:27:33,314
They sure do. Yeah.

258
00:27:34,835 --> 00:27:36,635
Now, at first I didn't realise who you were.

259
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:39,354
Really? So, who am I?

260
00:27:39,995 --> 00:27:42,154
Well, an idiot, and soon a dead man.

261
00:27:43,115 --> 00:27:45,675
DA offers you a talk-and-walk,
and you turn him down?

262
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:47,756
Is that why you got me here?

263
00:27:47,996 --> 00:27:49,915
No, it's not. I'm here to warn you.

264
00:27:50,276 --> 00:27:52,555
- Save your breath.
- Oh, don't get smart with me.

265
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,394
I don't know how many others know
who you are,

266
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:55,834
but when the word gets out,

267
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:58,195
the killers are gonna be
coming out of the woodwork.

268
00:27:58,956 --> 00:27:59,956
Is that right?

269
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:02,835
And mark my words,

270
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:05,797
Markus Kane will not show you the
same type of loyalty that you've shown him.

271
00:28:20,317 --> 00:28:23,876
Look, 14K kills Xander,

272
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:25,995
he makes him a martyr. That's like an honour.

273
00:28:26,597 --> 00:28:30,237
Xander quits,
shames himself and the entire brotherhood.

274
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:33,238
That makes him like a pussy.

275
00:28:34,118 --> 00:28:35,237
You got him, guys?

276
00:28:36,158 --> 00:28:37,157
Yeah.

277
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:38,918
Oh, man.

278
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:41,837
I got a question. All these cars, man,
it's not exactly prison norm.

279
00:28:41,918 --> 00:28:42,958
What's the deal?

280
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:46,758
Hey, Terminal Island is not
about rehabilitation. You know what I mean?

281
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,277
It's a business.
All these cars, we melt them down,

282
00:28:51,358 --> 00:28:53,918
make weapons, guns, shells.

283
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,558
If it kills, we make it.

284
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:01,118
Hey, are you telling me the government's
paying top dollar for this recycled shit?

285
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:03,718
Top dollar?
Who said anything about top dollar?

286
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,518
Weyland International sells this stuff
dirt-cheap.

287
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:07,879
Yeah, when you're not paying for labour,

288
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:10,079
your prices can afford to be a little lower,
you know what I mean?

289
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,559
They're making
money off our blood.

290
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,000
- What do you know about these wheels?
- A little bit.

291
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,839
- How does she run?
- Why don't you see what she's got?

292
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,520
- For real?
- For real.

293
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,599
Why not?

294
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:39,804
Someone's been
driving a getaway car!

295
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:43,282
God damn,
you put some magic in this thing.

296
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:46,403
- How does she handle?
- Just the way she's supposed to.

297
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:47,963
Who was driving that car?

298
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:50,162
- What car?
- What car?

299
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:02,124
Hey, Luke, you a fighter?

300
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,283
I got no reason to fight anyone.

301
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:07,364
Hey, reasons don't mean shit in this place.

302
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:09,924
The Calendar's always looking
for new blood,

303
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:11,885
and you look like just her type.

304
00:31:12,325 --> 00:31:13,524
Good to know.

305
00:31:22,406 --> 00:31:26,445
Some advice, blend in.
Don't give her no reason to fixate on you.

306
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:29,364
Hey, Goldberg, I'm the last guy
looking for a fucking spotlight.

307
00:31:32,446 --> 00:31:33,565
- Hey!
- Hey!

308
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,606
OFFICER: Stay back! Stay back!

309
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:38,085
Everybody else stay back!

310
00:31:40,447 --> 00:31:41,646
I don't want you in there. Move back.

311
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,925
All of you, stay back! Let's go! Move back!

312
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,007
- What's going on here?
- Big guy tripped.

313
00:32:03,168 --> 00:32:05,808
- That so, Bill?
- Yeah, I tripped.

314
00:32:07,248 --> 00:32:08,367
That's what he says.

315
00:32:08,848 --> 00:32:10,127
All right, let's go! Keep it moving!

316
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,767
Come on, move!
Get moving! Move! Move!

317
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:13,846
Who's the little guy?

318
00:32:14,087 --> 00:32:16,047
- His name's Lists.
- Lists?

319
00:32:17,608 --> 00:32:19,367
You'll work it out.

320
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:25,288
You ever hear of a computer?
You're, like, a century behind everyone.

321
00:32:25,489 --> 00:32:27,488
I'm surprised I don't find an abacus in here.

322
00:32:27,569 --> 00:32:29,927
- What are you doing in my office?
- I'm here for him.

323
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:32,848
Carl Lucas.
Even the name gives me a hard-on.

324
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:37,569
The judge called him a monster at his trial.
He's perfect.

325
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:39,968
- I can sell him.
- You can't have him.

326
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:42,768
- I wasn't asking your permission.
- Wait. There's more to it.

327
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:44,527
DA thinks there's a chance

328
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:48,488
that he could turn state witness
against Markus Kane.

329
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,850
Now, you put him on your TV show,

330
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,369
not only could those animals kill him,

331
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:58,448
but basically, he just advertises to Kane
where the chief witness against him sleeps,

332
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,569
and then he's a dead man.

333
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,691
Mr. Lucas' problem, not mine.

334
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,409
Warden Parks, you and your prison
exist for one reason,

335
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:10,329
to facilitate Death Match.

336
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,288
And here I thought we were here
to protect society and punish criminals.

337
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,289
Then you're dumber than I thought.

338
00:34:04,134 --> 00:34:05,731
Give us a minute.

339
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,531
Would you like a towel?

340
00:34:13,613 --> 00:34:14,973
I'm fine.

341
00:34:15,773 --> 00:34:17,053
Yeah, I'll say.

342
00:34:18,814 --> 00:34:20,493
Very impressive.

343
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,253
And your fight with Big Bill yesterday,

344
00:34:25,093 --> 00:34:27,054
also impressive.

345
00:34:28,575 --> 00:34:30,813
- I don't think we've met. I'm...
- Yeah, I know who you are.

346
00:34:32,734 --> 00:34:34,133
Save the sales pitch, huh?

347
00:34:34,454 --> 00:34:35,493
I'm not fighting.

348
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:39,773
If I want you to fight, you fight.

349
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:41,173
- Is that right?
- Yes.

350
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:44,734
I can't do anything about the life sentences,

351
00:34:45,855 --> 00:34:47,215
but you participate,

352
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:50,733
and I will make your life here
much more tolerable.

353
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:55,534
Your own cell, no work detail,

354
00:34:57,176 --> 00:34:58,375
real food,

355
00:35:00,575 --> 00:35:01,934
as well as plenty of

356
00:35:07,495 --> 00:35:09,374
- perks.
- Okay.

357
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:12,695
So, I...

358
00:35:17,776 --> 00:35:19,895
I win some fights for you,

359
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:23,495
you need another guy to beat me.

360
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:27,456
I mean, that's...

361
00:35:28,857 --> 00:35:30,016
That's how it works, right?

362
00:35:32,376 --> 00:35:33,416
Yeah.

363
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:37,135
Okay.

364
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:40,816
Hey,

365
00:35:42,097 --> 00:35:44,136
go sell sleazy someplace else,

366
00:35:46,898 --> 00:35:48,057
'cause I ain't buying.

367
00:35:49,778 --> 00:35:52,536
- You won't leave me any choice.
- Do what you gotta do.

368
00:35:53,378 --> 00:35:54,777
I'm not gonna be a part of your freak show.

369
00:35:55,978 --> 00:35:57,337
We'll see.

370
00:36:00,898 --> 00:36:02,257
Hey.

371
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:04,978
You don't hear the word "no" so often,
do you?

372
00:36:05,818 --> 00:36:07,417
Only when I say it.

373
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:15,418
Dim the lights,
the carnage is about to begin.

374
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:18,738
Good evening,
and welcome to Death Match.

375
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:24,299
Two men will be randomly selected live,
right before your eyes.

376
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,339
Only the winner walks out alive.

377
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:29,698
Are there any fighters in here tonight?

378
00:36:45,221 --> 00:36:46,579
I need one more.

379
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,579
No! No!

380
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,860
This is fucking bullshit.

381
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,979
Welcome to Death Match.

382
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,540
Hey! Hey, lady. Okay, you made your point.

383
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,260
- Switch us up.
- Oh, so now you wanna fight?

384
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:11,461
Fucking right. They're gonna kill him
in there, you know that.

385
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:13,862
Yeah, I certainly hope so.
The name of the game is Death Match.

386
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,181
What the fuck is wrong with you?

387
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:17,620
Hey! Get your fucking hands...

388
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:21,861
There are two ways to win.
Kill your opponent, or make him submit.

389
00:37:22,343 --> 00:37:24,580
There are several
pressure plates that, when activated,

390
00:37:24,662 --> 00:37:27,261
can give a fighter access
to a variety of weapons.

391
00:37:27,742 --> 00:37:31,621
And this week, we have a new weapon
that will blow your mind.

392
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:36,421
Come on!

393
00:37:43,983 --> 00:37:45,022
Fuck him up, Bill!

394
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:50,422
Come on! Come on!

395
00:37:55,743 --> 00:37:56,942
Mother...

396
00:38:04,943 --> 00:38:06,462
Motherfucker's crazy!

397
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,863
But cool.

398
00:38:19,145 --> 00:38:21,064
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I want on the floor. Can you help?

399
00:38:31,264 --> 00:38:32,263
LISTS: Get him, Luke!

400
00:38:57,426 --> 00:38:58,424
LISTS: Watch out!

401
00:38:59,466 --> 00:39:00,465
Watch out!

402
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:13,465
Get the fuck out of here! Go!

403
00:39:17,228 --> 00:39:18,305
Don't look good for our boy.

404
00:39:23,827 --> 00:39:25,826
LISTS: This way! This way! Come on!

405
00:39:30,227 --> 00:39:31,627
The door, Luke! The door!

406
00:39:32,148 --> 00:39:35,147
This is some bullshit! This game is rigged!

407
00:39:37,268 --> 00:39:39,787
Barbecue his white ass!
Yo, the white boy's cheating!

408
00:39:39,908 --> 00:39:42,706
- Fucking cracker's cheating!
- Fuck you, you nigger!

409
00:39:42,868 --> 00:39:44,428
- You piece of shit!
- Watch out!

410
00:39:55,587 --> 00:39:56,587
BIG BILL: Come on!

411
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,069
Come on! Let's get in there!

412
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:11,548
Come on, come on! Go, go! Get out there!

413
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,229
I told you.

414
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,949
Switch!

415
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:42,591
Go, go, go!

416
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:55,190
Get the fuck over here!
Come on! Come on!

417
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:56,350
Get back.

418
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:02,230
LISTS: Watch out, Luke!

419
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:27,671
Get ready to scream, bitch!

420
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:36,712
Fuck you!
- Who's screaming now, bitch?

421
00:41:37,113 --> 00:41:38,393
Code red, arena stage.

422
00:41:38,834 --> 00:41:41,273
- End transmission now.
- Are you fucking crazy?

423
00:41:41,354 --> 00:41:43,713
- Shut it down.
- No way. This is my show.

424
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,392
And this is my prison.
End this broadcast now

425
00:41:46,473 --> 00:41:48,673
or you're gonna be one of the cons
instead ofjust filming them.

426
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:49,832
Got it.

427
00:41:49,914 --> 00:41:52,192
Death Match is a trademark
of Weyland International.

428
00:41:52,273 --> 00:41:55,073
Fighters are convicted violent felons.
Acts should not be duplicated at home.

429
00:41:58,475 --> 00:41:59,593
OFFICER: Get on the ground!

430
00:42:01,675 --> 00:42:02,674
Luke!

431
00:42:04,994 --> 00:42:06,074
OFFICER: Come on, get on the bus!

432
00:42:09,475 --> 00:42:11,073
You wanna live? Stay down.

433
00:42:43,755 --> 00:42:44,996
Wasn't that Luke?

434
00:42:46,956 --> 00:42:47,956
What?

435
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:50,955
Fuck!

436
00:42:51,596 --> 00:42:52,795
Get me the phone!

437
00:42:53,477 --> 00:42:54,475
Fuck.

438
00:42:55,316 --> 00:42:57,797
Just relax, huh? Just relax.
Won't hurt a bit. Relax.

439
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:01,155
Any closer, buddy...

440
00:43:01,237 --> 00:43:03,717
You're really lucky,
or this would have hit the femoral artery.

441
00:43:04,077 --> 00:43:07,597
- Yeah, that's me. Lucky.
- Yeah. You can say that.

442
00:43:08,918 --> 00:43:12,036
Man!
- Just relax. Relax.

443
00:43:14,477 --> 00:43:18,236
It's a minor setback.
A few rapists and murderers died. Boo-hoo.

444
00:43:18,436 --> 00:43:19,796
No. This is the end.

445
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:22,876
You messed it up by pulling the plug.
We would've won the night.

446
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:26,637
You're not good enough in bed
to win this one.

447
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,958
Sweet dreams.

448
00:43:41,278 --> 00:43:42,198
OFFICER: Come on, over here.

449
00:43:43,398 --> 00:43:44,397
Fuck.

450
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,597
OFFICER: Sit down there and shut up.

451
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:50,839
- OFFICER: Quiet down.
- Hey.

452
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:52,598
What happened?

453
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,439
You're not the only one
that got in some good shots.

454
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,278
- I know.
All right, ladies! Line it up!

455
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,038
The bus is leaving.
Don't make me tell you twice!

456
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,719
- Hey.
- OFFICER: Let's go.

457
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:10,118
- Thanks, huh?
- OFFICER: Step through, ladies!

458
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,159
Yeah. I don't know why I did it.

459
00:44:12,841 --> 00:44:14,598
Probably get thrown in the hole for that.

460
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,479
Then why?

461
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,759
Why did you help that con?

462
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:24,480
Wasn't gonna let the man fight my fight.

463
00:44:25,722 --> 00:44:27,399
OFFICER: Right this way. Let's go.

464
00:44:32,322 --> 00:44:33,320
You got a name?

465
00:44:33,642 --> 00:44:36,000
Uh-huh. Yeah. Of course I do.

466
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,440
Come on, man.

467
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,521
There he is.

468
00:44:50,122 --> 00:44:51,602
How the fuck is he still alive?

469
00:44:51,683 --> 00:44:53,201
Boss, we've been
assured it's happening.

470
00:44:53,282 --> 00:44:54,840
It's been happening for weeks now.

471
00:44:55,202 --> 00:44:57,122
How much longer
do you think he's gonna stay silent?

472
00:44:57,203 --> 00:44:59,121
He's a tough guy, and he's been loyal...

473
00:44:59,202 --> 00:45:01,001
I want him dead!

474
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:03,242
We have someone on the inside,
a total psycho.

475
00:45:03,482 --> 00:45:05,322
- It won't take long now.
- Joey. Joey.

476
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:10,842
The box, with its implications
of rigidity and squareness,

477
00:45:11,643 --> 00:45:15,682
symbolises unimaginative thinking
and painful frustration.

478
00:45:23,563 --> 00:45:25,763
Sometimes
we just have to step back,

479
00:45:25,844 --> 00:45:28,683
see if the solutions to our problem
lies outside the box.

480
00:45:30,524 --> 00:45:31,524
Call a meeting.

481
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:35,202
- With who?
- Everyone!

482
00:45:37,325 --> 00:45:40,203
- You didn't return my calls.
- I don't return a lot of calls.

483
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:42,442
I wanna discuss Death Match.
I think that we should pull the plug.

484
00:45:42,764 --> 00:45:45,523
When a real-life riot doesn't generate
a second-hour boost,

485
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:49,524
- I'd say it's time to cut your loss.
- Exactly. We need to evolve.

486
00:45:49,604 --> 00:45:52,403
We've developed a strong base,
we have legitimate TV stars...

487
00:45:52,484 --> 00:45:55,004
The board's decision is final, Miss Jones.

488
00:45:58,485 --> 00:46:01,364
In the past six months, I'm the only
profitable thing about this company.

489
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:05,203
Unless you want a sexual harassment suit
crammed down your throat,

490
00:46:05,285 --> 00:46:07,204
you will listen to what I have to say.

491
00:46:17,727 --> 00:46:18,725
Fine.

492
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:21,685
9:00 a. M. Tomorrow.

493
00:46:47,928 --> 00:46:49,127
I'm troubled.

494
00:46:50,487 --> 00:46:54,687
What seemed to be a very simple task
has taken the most perplexing of turns.

495
00:46:57,208 --> 00:46:58,406
So I'm gonna speak slowly,

496
00:46:59,328 --> 00:47:00,407
clearly,

497
00:47:01,687 --> 00:47:04,726
so my message is not lost, or ignored,
or misinterpreted.

498
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:10,407
One million dollars to the man
who kills Carl Lucas.

499
00:47:12,528 --> 00:47:15,249
This offer expires in 48 hours,
and if that happens,

500
00:47:16,729 --> 00:47:18,687
I will consider you all enemies,

501
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:22,007
and I will bring war on your fucking head.

502
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:25,008
Understand?

503
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:31,768
Ninety percent
of Terminal Island,

504
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,688
your grand investment, is dead space.

505
00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:37,168
Death Match merely stayed your execution.

506
00:47:37,248 --> 00:47:40,208
If you wanna get a breath of fresh air,
you need a bold initiative.

507
00:47:40,449 --> 00:47:41,968
I propose a race.

508
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,010
Wicked. Epic.

509
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:47,130
Something like no one has ever seen before.

510
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,048
The track will run the length
of Terminal Island

511
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,330
along some of the narrowest
and most harrowing paths

512
00:47:54,411 --> 00:47:55,610
that the racing world has to offer.

513
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:59,930
The best part of it, everything that we need
is right in our own backyard.

514
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:02,168
We're gonna modify each vehicle,

515
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:05,328
adding reinforced steel plating,
bulletproof glass, and roll cages

516
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,569
to at least give the drivers a fighting chance.

517
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:09,490
We'll take everything
that made Death Match a hit,

518
00:48:10,051 --> 00:48:12,049
combine it with everything
we have at our disposal.

519
00:48:12,852 --> 00:48:13,850
Such as?

520
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:15,210
Heavy fucking artillery.

521
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:22,771
Every car will hold as many
guns and as much ammunition as it can.

522
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:27,372
So, you're going to arm the prisoners.

523
00:48:27,651 --> 00:48:31,170
Precautions will be made to make sure
they can only shoot at people on the track.

524
00:48:33,012 --> 00:48:36,530
Nine cars, three days,
20,000 rounds of ammunition.

525
00:48:40,692 --> 00:48:42,931
Going from fighting to racing,
that's a big leap.

526
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:48,010
We need a hook.
Something that incorporates the two better.

527
00:48:48,572 --> 00:48:53,691
Now, in a game show, no one cares
about the game. The game's arbitrary.

528
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:56,811
People care about the risk and the money.

529
00:48:57,133 --> 00:49:01,011
Now, we've been concentrating on the game,
not the risk.

530
00:49:01,413 --> 00:49:02,931
That's why our audience is bored.

531
00:49:03,293 --> 00:49:05,092
Let's concentrate on the prize.

532
00:49:05,412 --> 00:49:08,252
A prize more valuable than money.

533
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,733
Okay. What's more valuable than money?

534
00:49:14,014 --> 00:49:15,213
Life

535
00:49:16,215 --> 00:49:18,133
is a more valuable prize than money.

536
00:49:18,614 --> 00:49:21,173
In our deal with the state,
we control sentencing.

537
00:49:21,415 --> 00:49:23,334
That means we control their life.

538
00:49:23,414 --> 00:49:26,454
So if a prisoner wins five races,
he gets his freedom.

539
00:49:26,534 --> 00:49:30,533
No matter what he's in for,
robbery, rape, homicide, whatever,

540
00:49:31,574 --> 00:49:33,133
he wins his freedom.

541
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:35,253
He wins his life.

542
00:49:35,975 --> 00:49:37,293
You have life,

543
00:49:39,256 --> 00:49:40,214
freedom.

544
00:49:43,335 --> 00:49:44,335
Stop.

545
00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:50,455
Death Race.

546
00:49:57,415 --> 00:50:00,133
You know what?
That's fucking bullshit, Rocco.

547
00:50:00,535 --> 00:50:02,135
Well, how do you know, man?
Maybe it's for real.

548
00:50:02,215 --> 00:50:03,174
Are you kidding me?

549
00:50:03,256 --> 00:50:06,294
You think they're gonna let murderers
and rapists out of this place, ever?

550
00:50:06,376 --> 00:50:07,976
Hey, Luke's right.

551
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:10,856
And besides that, homes,
you don't drive worth a shit.

552
00:50:10,938 --> 00:50:13,015
You know what? Fucking blow me.

553
00:50:16,697 --> 00:50:17,976
Fucking faggot.

554
00:50:19,896 --> 00:50:22,456
That would be the only chance I have
of getting out.

555
00:50:24,017 --> 00:50:26,095
And what would you do, Lists,
if you got out?

556
00:50:29,737 --> 00:50:31,096
Start over.

557
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:40,297
Welcome to Death Race.

558
00:50:40,377 --> 00:50:45,017
Terminal Island Penitentiary hosts
three days of the ultimate in auto carnage.

559
00:50:45,098 --> 00:50:47,337
Day one of the race begins in 10 minutes,

560
00:50:47,498 --> 00:50:49,618
and will be brought to you
without commercial interruption

561
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:54,137
by Weyland International.
Your safety is our top priority.

562
00:50:54,297 --> 00:50:57,137
Get ready. The show's about to begin.

563
00:51:11,979 --> 00:51:14,618
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.

564
00:51:15,099 --> 00:51:18,218
Welcome to day one
of Death Race.

565
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,299
Before you, 18 cons vie for their freedom.

566
00:51:22,139 --> 00:51:25,659
They must survive all three laps
in order to proceed to day two.

567
00:51:26,298 --> 00:51:27,578
Their first challenge?

568
00:51:28,179 --> 00:51:30,099
There are only nine cars.

569
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,338
That's right, gentlemen. Nine cars!

570
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:37,499
Three, two, one,

571
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:39,739
go!

572
00:52:07,901 --> 00:52:09,339
This is what I'm talking about!

573
00:52:13,182 --> 00:52:14,141
Mine!

574
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:19,421
This just keeps getting better and better!

575
00:52:19,582 --> 00:52:22,301
- Hey, baby.
- How about a bit v rodet?

576
00:52:40,943 --> 00:52:42,302
Oh, baby, yeah!

577
00:52:50,062 --> 00:52:51,382
Don't think so!

578
00:52:54,903 --> 00:52:56,222
Why did you let that con beat you?

579
00:52:58,302 --> 00:53:00,143
- Shit!
- Hang on!

580
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:08,623
- Fuck!
- Hey, why do I need this?

581
00:53:08,704 --> 00:53:10,944
- You mind helping me out with this?
- Yeah. Yeah. Who am I talking to?

582
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,023
- To talk to your pit team.
- Pit team?

583
00:53:13,104 --> 00:53:14,904
Luke! Good to have you, man.

584
00:53:15,423 --> 00:53:18,943
So, you got your guns, your oil, your smoke,
and your napalm here.

585
00:53:19,904 --> 00:53:22,303
- Get your eyes on the road.
- Let's race.

586
00:53:36,825 --> 00:53:38,305
Luke! Goldberg.

587
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:41,985
Yeah. The Mexican Jew's here
to save your bony white ass.

588
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:44,824
Now, swords and shields don't play
until the second lap.

589
00:53:45,466 --> 00:53:48,784
You've got the fastest car out there,
except the Porsche.

590
00:53:49,106 --> 00:53:51,584
And don't go head-to-head with that Ram,
or he'll have you for lunch.

591
00:53:52,865 --> 00:53:53,946
Son of a bitch!

592
00:53:59,107 --> 00:54:01,105
Looks like we're already on the menu.

593
00:54:04,466 --> 00:54:05,466
Eat this.

594
00:54:07,747 --> 00:54:08,706
You feel me, baby?

595
00:54:11,747 --> 00:54:14,306
- BIG BILL: Now I got you, baby!
- Is that all you got, pretty boy?

596
00:54:14,388 --> 00:54:15,586
Careful of the one on the right!

597
00:54:16,346 --> 00:54:17,346
Good to know.

598
00:54:26,147 --> 00:54:28,228
- Yeah! That's my man!
- Yes!

599
00:54:33,668 --> 00:54:35,748
- Where is he? Where is he?
- To the left.

600
00:54:37,468 --> 00:54:38,907
Xander Grady.

601
00:54:40,468 --> 00:54:42,628
Come on!
Get it going!

602
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:53,427
Fucking Chinese bastard! I'll kill you!

603
00:54:56,389 --> 00:54:57,429
Shit! Bastard!

604
00:54:58,470 --> 00:54:59,428
Motherfucker!

605
00:55:07,749 --> 00:55:11,269
That was a great lap, Luke, but now
you need to get to a sword plate, and fast.

606
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:12,629
Activate swords, shields and death heads.

607
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,149
Sword pressure plates activated.

608
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,749
Shield pressure plates activated.

609
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,829
You gotta find a sword, Luke.
You gotta find a sword plate.

610
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:22,468
That's right. Get back to work.

611
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:23,989
There's one!

612
00:55:24,471 --> 00:55:25,830
- I see it.
- Go for it. Go for it!

613
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:31,749
Sword pressure plate activated.

614
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:33,910
HILLBILLY: Yeah!
How do you like that one, boy?

615
00:55:35,912 --> 00:55:38,630
What the hell is he doing?

616
00:55:39,911 --> 00:55:40,990
- Oh, jeez!
- Guns! Guns!

617
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:44,829
Eat my lead, boy! Eat my lead!

618
00:55:49,031 --> 00:55:50,150
Get down! Now!

619
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,830
- Hey, get out of there!
Get down!

620
00:55:54,592 --> 00:55:55,911
How's it feel, boy?

621
00:55:56,072 --> 00:55:57,191
You gotta turn here!

622
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,311
I'm working on it.

623
00:56:05,472 --> 00:56:06,592
Hang on.

624
00:56:13,032 --> 00:56:15,271
God! Oh, God, no!

625
00:56:19,512 --> 00:56:20,711
Yeah!

626
00:56:21,513 --> 00:56:23,633
- Ooh, yeah!
That was close.

627
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:27,192
Stock car racing
got its start during Prohibition

628
00:56:27,274 --> 00:56:29,911
with moonshine runners
fleeing federal agents.

629
00:56:30,393 --> 00:56:35,432
Bill France Sr. Conceived NASCAR in 1947
during a meeting in Daytona, Florida.

630
00:56:37,113 --> 00:56:39,232
"Lists." I get it now.

631
00:56:49,194 --> 00:56:50,595
Shield pressure plates activated.

632
00:57:02,116 --> 00:57:03,113
Motherfucker.

633
00:57:29,677 --> 00:57:31,915
- Get a close-up on that.
Camera two, move to your left.

634
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,554
Where did he go? Huh?

635
00:57:41,356 --> 00:57:42,315
Where did he go?

636
00:57:45,516 --> 00:57:46,755
You ain't escaping me now.

637
00:57:48,877 --> 00:57:50,956
A million dollars. It's gonna be mine.

638
00:57:51,277 --> 00:57:52,356
What did he just say?

639
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:53,996
Replay that for me.

640
00:57:54,116 --> 00:57:56,837
BIG BILL: A million dollars.
It's gonna be mine.

641
00:57:58,158 --> 00:57:59,277
I'll take care of it.

642
00:58:11,877 --> 00:58:12,877
Take the wheel.

643
00:58:25,959 --> 00:58:27,038
Take that, bitch.
Think you're special?

644
00:58:29,118 --> 00:58:30,118
No!

645
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:32,557
No! No!

646
00:58:39,278 --> 00:58:40,318
No!

647
00:59:03,759 --> 00:59:05,359
One lap to go, Luke. This is it.

648
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,880
Stay with me, baby. Stay with me.

649
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,320
Oh, yeah!

650
00:59:13,201 --> 00:59:14,160
Yeah!

651
00:59:14,881 --> 00:59:16,241
- Damn it!
- Get out of there! Get out of there!

652
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:18,160
Enough of this shit.

653
00:59:24,682 --> 00:59:26,120
- What the hell?
- Hang on.

654
00:59:26,921 --> 00:59:28,400
Stay with me. Stay with me.

655
00:59:29,201 --> 00:59:30,320
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

656
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:45,042
Yeah! All right! All right!

657
00:59:45,283 --> 00:59:46,562
Bullshit, motherfucker!

658
00:59:47,442 --> 00:59:48,521
That's it. That's it.

659
00:59:50,122 --> 00:59:51,601
Sword pressure plate activated.

660
00:59:54,483 --> 00:59:55,442
Not that one!

661
00:59:56,723 --> 00:59:58,282
Did you just drop our fucking tombstone?

662
01:00:00,403 --> 01:00:01,361
Yeah, my bad.

663
01:00:02,643 --> 01:00:03,681
Not good.

664
01:00:04,482 --> 01:00:05,522
What you doing?

665
01:00:05,762 --> 01:00:07,522
- What you doing?
- Drive, pretty boy.

666
01:00:09,803 --> 01:00:10,802
"Pretty boy."

667
01:00:11,282 --> 01:00:14,124
God damn this fucking car!

668
01:00:16,243 --> 01:00:17,202
Hang on!

669
01:00:19,564 --> 01:00:20,883
Take this, you asshole!

670
01:00:21,364 --> 01:00:22,564
- Eat that!
- Fuck!

671
01:00:23,044 --> 01:00:25,364
- Hang on!
- KATRINA: You're going down!

672
01:00:25,683 --> 01:00:26,642
That's nice work.

673
01:00:26,924 --> 01:00:27,923
Talk to me!

674
01:00:33,443 --> 01:00:34,482
Now you're going down!

675
01:00:40,725 --> 01:00:41,684
Sweet!

676
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:43,923
I guess I lucked out, then.

677
01:00:44,884 --> 01:00:45,924
Nice.

678
01:00:46,085 --> 01:00:48,883
- Guess we put that magic to work, Goldberg.
- Well, bravo!

679
01:00:49,285 --> 01:00:50,484
Come on, Luke! Yeah!

680
01:00:50,645 --> 01:00:53,204
The debut
of Death Race is in the books.

681
01:00:53,285 --> 01:00:55,444
CarI Lucas is the surprise winner,

682
01:00:55,525 --> 01:01:00,644
followed by Big Bill, Calin, Apache,
Xander and 14K.

683
01:01:01,485 --> 01:01:04,405
Can CarI Lucas hold on to win his freedom?

684
01:01:04,565 --> 01:01:07,124
Tune in tomorrow to find out.

685
01:01:16,565 --> 01:01:17,685
Yeah! Yeah!

686
01:01:20,727 --> 01:01:23,886
- Man! You can drive, man!
- What a rush, old man.

687
01:01:24,327 --> 01:01:26,165
Hey, Goldberg, you kidding me?

688
01:01:28,246 --> 01:01:30,005
Hey, where'd you learn that?

689
01:01:30,485 --> 01:01:32,405
- I was a Girl Scout.
- Really?

690
01:01:33,846 --> 01:01:36,406
- I'm gonna get you, fucker!
Is that right?

691
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,085
You don't mess with somebody
in this motherfucking race!

692
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:39,206
- Is that a fucking date?
- Yeah!

693
01:01:39,287 --> 01:01:41,526
- Yeah? Come on! Fucking pretty boy!
- Gonna fucking blow up your ass!

694
01:01:41,647 --> 01:01:43,127
Come on, suck my dick, bitch!

695
01:01:43,887 --> 01:01:46,007
Hey, Lists, go kick his ass. Come on.

696
01:01:54,928 --> 01:01:56,646
Tomorrow, you die.

697
01:02:05,367 --> 01:02:07,287
Katrina! Let's go.

698
01:02:12,569 --> 01:02:16,848
- Hey, so I get to see you tomorrow, or what?
- If you're lucky.

699
01:02:28,088 --> 01:02:29,048
Damn.

700
01:02:30,888 --> 01:02:32,808
Hey, come on, snap out of it, guys.

701
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:35,408
Hey, Lists, you gotta fix it up there
under here.

702
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,810
Right here. Right in here.

703
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:48,970
OFFICER 1: Come on, Lucas, let's go.

704
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:52,210
OFFICER 2: You heard him. Move.
Hey, what did I do?

705
01:02:55,850 --> 01:02:57,008
OFFICER 3: Go to sleep!

706
01:03:05,972 --> 01:03:06,970
Hey, this is bullshit!

707
01:03:13,531 --> 01:03:14,731
Okay, what did I do?

708
01:03:15,052 --> 01:03:16,170
You won!

709
01:03:16,732 --> 01:03:19,771
To the victor belongs the spoils.

710
01:03:20,691 --> 01:03:21,851
Okay, so what does that mean?

711
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:26,009
What is this?

712
01:03:27,211 --> 01:03:31,410
In ancient Rome, the winning gladiator
was the recipient of gifts.

713
01:03:32,732 --> 01:03:35,252
A show of gratitude from the powers that be

714
01:03:35,892 --> 01:03:37,811
for a job well done.

715
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:39,611
She's yours.

716
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:45,052
Mmm-hmm.

717
01:03:45,772 --> 01:03:47,412
Do with her what you please.

718
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:49,372
Is that right?

719
01:03:49,773 --> 01:03:50,971
And who the fuck are you?

720
01:03:53,373 --> 01:03:54,491
I'm Caesar.

721
01:04:08,253 --> 01:04:10,332
You know, they're probably watching.

722
01:04:10,974 --> 01:04:12,253
Mmm-hmm.

723
01:04:13,054 --> 01:04:14,333
Listening, too, I guess.

724
01:04:14,974 --> 01:04:16,693
Some kind of game they're playing.

725
01:04:17,694 --> 01:04:20,013
Yeah, probably betting
on what we'll do next.

726
01:04:20,094 --> 01:04:22,652
Option A, they're trying to get us closer

727
01:04:24,254 --> 01:04:26,173
so they can use one of us against the other.

728
01:04:26,254 --> 01:04:27,453
Uh-huh.

729
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:31,734
Option B being, maybe, put a wedge
between us, so we fuck up on the track?

730
01:04:33,056 --> 01:04:34,814
I guess we do what they want,

731
01:04:36,255 --> 01:04:38,334
and leave the bullshit for later.

732
01:04:41,536 --> 01:04:43,055
You playing me?

733
01:04:45,855 --> 01:04:47,214
Does it matter?

734
01:04:50,296 --> 01:04:51,294
No.

735
01:05:56,338 --> 01:05:58,818
Kane put a million-dollar bounty on Lucas,

736
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:01,177
and all the bangers are going for it.

737
01:06:06,739 --> 01:06:08,499
Put Mr. Lucas in solitary.

738
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:12,178
I thought this was a prison thing, but this is
too big for even the guards to resist.

739
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,618
- You still gonna let him race?
- Oh, yeah.

740
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:17,698
They're free to kill him on the track,
just not off camera.

741
01:06:17,819 --> 01:06:18,817
What about him?

742
01:06:30,821 --> 01:06:31,939
Wait! Wait!

743
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:46,099
Come on. Let's go.

744
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,420
You had your fun. Move.

745
01:06:49,701 --> 01:06:51,620
- KATRINA: Where are we going?
- Shut up.

746
01:06:55,102 --> 01:06:56,821
KATRINA: What the fuck is this?

747
01:07:05,623 --> 01:07:08,341
Beautiful view of freedom from here, Katrina.

748
01:07:09,062 --> 01:07:10,140
KATRINA: Okay.

749
01:07:10,502 --> 01:07:11,741
But who are you?

750
01:07:15,941 --> 01:07:17,861
You're much more attractive in person.

751
01:07:18,622 --> 01:07:21,462
I'm flattered. What do you want?

752
01:07:23,302 --> 01:07:25,703
Carl Lucas. I want him dead.

753
01:07:26,663 --> 01:07:29,542
And in return, I offer you freedom.

754
01:07:31,942 --> 01:07:34,023
A chance of life outside these walls

755
01:07:35,223 --> 01:07:36,983
for one simple task.

756
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:41,662
You've got 48 hours.
You kill him or I kill you.

757
01:07:48,263 --> 01:07:50,462
Let me make these walls disappear.

758
01:07:52,223 --> 01:07:54,823
Let me make you part of the view
from outside, Katrina.

759
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:55,943
Freedom.

760
01:08:00,824 --> 01:08:02,184
Forty-eight hours.

761
01:08:04,424 --> 01:08:05,543
Tick-tock.

762
01:08:25,866 --> 01:08:27,944
- Yeah?
Sixty-five share.

763
01:08:28,225 --> 01:08:29,704
Well done, young lady.

764
01:08:37,626 --> 01:08:39,105
It's truly for the best.

765
01:08:41,026 --> 01:08:43,145
You weren't happy, the board wasn't happy.

766
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:46,505
We need someone for this institution
that shares the common vision.

767
01:08:47,146 --> 01:08:48,385
Just wasn't you.

768
01:08:50,347 --> 01:08:53,226
Warden Parks,
we're here to escort you from the premises.

769
01:08:57,146 --> 01:08:59,466
"Whosoever diggeth a pit shall fall therein."

770
01:09:00,947 --> 01:09:02,465
Proverb 26:27.

771
01:09:03,987 --> 01:09:05,106
Is that supposed to be deep?

772
01:09:05,747 --> 01:09:07,425
Hopefully deep enough that, when you fall,

773
01:09:08,106 --> 01:09:09,426
you'll break your fucking neck.

774
01:09:29,069 --> 01:09:31,147
- What do you want?
- Time to race.

775
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:04,269
You got a big fucking bulls-eye
on your back, Luke.

776
01:10:04,749 --> 01:10:06,628
You feel all those eyes on you?

777
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:09,709
Ain't 'cause you're pretty,
or because you're in first place.

778
01:10:10,349 --> 01:10:13,189
Markus Kane put a million dollars
on your head.

779
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:16,590
It's a monster fucking bounty, Lucas.

780
01:10:17,031 --> 01:10:18,190
It's as plain as day.

781
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:19,950
I don't believe it.

782
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:21,709
Why would I lie?

783
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:23,990
It makes no fucking sense.

784
01:10:26,311 --> 01:10:27,629
What're you gonna do?

785
01:10:47,472 --> 01:10:50,072
Two, one, and we're in.

786
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:52,751
Welcome to Death Race.

787
01:10:53,352 --> 01:10:57,031
Eighteen men started. Only six remain.

788
01:10:57,112 --> 01:11:01,231
An estimated 50 million people
watched CarI Lucas win day one.

789
01:11:01,751 --> 01:11:02,991
Can he do it again?

790
01:11:03,431 --> 01:11:06,511
Five other racers will have something to say
about that.

791
01:11:07,112 --> 01:11:09,872
Welcome to day two of Death Race.

792
01:11:11,793 --> 01:11:14,832
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.

793
01:11:19,992 --> 01:11:23,953
Hey! Aren't you twojust
bubbling over with sunshine this morning?

794
01:11:24,434 --> 01:11:26,512
Come on. We got a race to win.

795
01:11:31,634 --> 01:11:32,593
What is it?

796
01:11:34,992 --> 01:11:35,952
Nothing.

797
01:11:37,554 --> 01:11:38,513
Let's race.

798
01:11:52,755 --> 01:11:54,193
I've got you now, motherfucker!

799
01:11:54,355 --> 01:11:55,314
Coming up behind you!

800
01:11:56,276 --> 01:11:57,234
KATRINA: Watch out!

801
01:11:58,835 --> 01:12:01,354
Yeah! I just fucked your ass!

802
01:12:03,674 --> 01:12:04,754
Activate swords and shields.

803
01:12:09,715 --> 01:12:11,313
Sword plate activated.
- Damn!

804
01:12:12,275 --> 01:12:14,074
- KATRINA: Watch your back!
- Careful.

805
01:12:14,676 --> 01:12:15,635
Here comes the guns.

806
01:12:18,956 --> 01:12:20,035
You gotta find a shield, man.

807
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:21,115
You gotta find a shield!

808
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:22,316
- There's one!
- I see it.

809
01:12:22,396 --> 01:12:23,635
Go for it. Go for it!

810
01:12:25,996 --> 01:12:27,755
Shield pressure plate activated.

811
01:12:30,196 --> 01:12:32,115
- Throw the smoke!
- No, not yet.

812
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:34,915
Luke, what're you waiting for?

813
01:12:34,997 --> 01:12:35,995
Okay, ready?

814
01:12:36,116 --> 01:12:37,074
Pull it now!

815
01:12:38,476 --> 01:12:39,476
Smoke, now.

816
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:03,156
Let's get this car back in the race.

817
01:13:09,998 --> 01:13:10,998
Fuck!

818
01:13:13,919 --> 01:13:15,957
Yeah! Great shit!

819
01:13:24,598 --> 01:13:26,077
Okay, baby, now we come.

820
01:13:26,398 --> 01:13:27,798
Sword plate activated.

821
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:29,597
Go, go! Get gun! Get gun!

822
01:13:31,598 --> 01:13:33,518
- Watch your back!
Get your ass out of there, Luke.

823
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:36,719
Bounty is mine, motherfucker!

824
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:39,799
I'm tired of this asshole.

825
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:41,278
Time to lose.

826
01:13:42,959 --> 01:13:43,959
CALIN: Oh, my God.

827
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:45,279
Hang on.

828
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:24,920
Dig that!

829
01:14:43,962 --> 01:14:45,321
Still taking it, huh?

830
01:14:45,403 --> 01:14:47,202
- You die!
- Come on!

831
01:14:47,323 --> 01:14:49,122
Today! Today you die!

832
01:14:49,882 --> 01:14:51,322
What do you got, huh?

833
01:15:04,724 --> 01:15:06,003
Beautiful.

834
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:29,963
All right, it's clear sailing
to the finish line now.

835
01:15:33,005 --> 01:15:34,204
What are you doing?

836
01:15:38,364 --> 01:15:40,923
- The enemy of my enemy.
- What's happening?

837
01:15:42,046 --> 01:15:43,084
You die.

838
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:05,246
KATRINA: You wanna tell me why
you just risked our lives to save that banger?

839
01:16:05,565 --> 01:16:08,045
They're Triads. The only people
Markus would not deal with.

840
01:16:08,686 --> 01:16:11,006
That's why they're not after us.
They have no clue about the hit.

841
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:17,085
Look, it's a Triad kill thing.
It's a life for a life.

842
01:16:17,486 --> 01:16:19,646
I save his, he owes me a favour.

843
01:16:40,488 --> 01:16:42,247
- Well, I saved your life.
- Really? How so?

844
01:16:42,608 --> 01:16:46,527
Because your Markus Kane offered
to buy my freedom if I would kill you.

845
01:16:46,728 --> 01:16:48,926
Jesus! They all want me dead, now you, too?

846
01:16:52,288 --> 01:16:55,327
- I guess you owe me a favour, too.
- I can't wait.

847
01:16:56,207 --> 01:16:59,728
- Hey! I want a favour, too, huh?
- Fuck off, Goldberg.

848
01:17:04,608 --> 01:17:05,648
Yeah, I got you, baby.

849
01:17:05,968 --> 01:17:07,648
Sword pressure plates activated.

850
01:17:09,089 --> 01:17:10,129
Shield ahead.

851
01:17:11,089 --> 01:17:12,849
Shield pressure plate activated.

852
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:14,048
Okay, ready?

853
01:17:14,609 --> 01:17:15,648
Activate the napalm on my signal.

854
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:19,728
Now.

855
01:17:22,529 --> 01:17:24,807
- What's this?
- KATRINA: It's not working!

856
01:17:25,769 --> 01:17:26,768
What's wrong?

857
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:28,848
- This is not good, Luke.
- It's a setup.

858
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:33,090
Yeah. I'm coming, baby!

859
01:17:36,209 --> 01:17:38,570
Hey, Goldberg.
Someone had a play date with this car.

860
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:41,450
I got nothing. No guns, no smoke, nothing.

861
01:17:41,571 --> 01:17:43,170
Come on, hit it, you dumbass bitch!

862
01:17:43,329 --> 01:17:44,809
Swerve! Swerve!

863
01:17:45,129 --> 01:17:46,689
- You, motherfucker!
- Turn!

864
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:47,969
What can I do?

865
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:50,209
- Brace yourself.
- No! What are you doing?

866
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:52,169
Get the fuck out ofthere!

867
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:55,009
Come on! You need to get out of there!

868
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:58,090
This is my fight.

869
01:17:58,852 --> 01:18:00,530
No choice. Hang on.

870
01:18:08,692 --> 01:18:09,731
Here I come!

871
01:18:11,491 --> 01:18:13,171
Motherfucker won't stop firing!

872
01:18:16,012 --> 01:18:17,769
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Heat-seeking missile
has been activated.

873
01:18:25,491 --> 01:18:27,412
- Come on!
- Hey! Get out of there!

874
01:18:36,214 --> 01:18:37,292
Come on.

875
01:18:56,214 --> 01:18:57,733
- Yeah! Shit!
- Yeah!

876
01:19:04,174 --> 01:19:06,693
- What the fuck?
- You just killed your own pit crew.

877
01:19:07,255 --> 01:19:09,133
Bitch, you shut the fuck up.

878
01:19:28,895 --> 01:19:31,055
- Goldberg.
- Hey, get out of there!

879
01:19:35,975 --> 01:19:37,654
Get in that car! I want a close-up.

880
01:19:38,375 --> 01:19:39,455
Get me out of here!

881
01:19:40,135 --> 01:19:41,215
Oh, God!

882
01:19:55,337 --> 01:19:56,336
No!

883
01:19:59,457 --> 01:20:00,856
Oh, my God, no!

884
01:20:07,256 --> 01:20:09,935
Somebody help!

885
01:20:15,497 --> 01:20:17,415
LISTS: Goldberg, get him out! Get him out!

886
01:20:32,378 --> 01:20:33,537
No.

887
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:05,618
Rest in peace, Luke.

888
01:21:10,779 --> 01:21:11,739
Rocco!

889
01:21:13,499 --> 01:21:16,378
- You gotta answer for Luke.
- What the fuck you talking about?

890
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:19,379
Katrina said it was rigged from the inside.

891
01:21:19,461 --> 01:21:21,900
And you're the only motherfucker
that could have got to it.

892
01:21:21,979 --> 01:21:23,418
You killed him?

893
01:21:25,901 --> 01:21:27,779
Get away from me. Fuck you both.

894
01:21:34,821 --> 01:21:35,819
- I need to talk to him.
- No.

895
01:21:36,181 --> 01:21:37,179
He saved your life!

896
01:21:42,221 --> 01:21:43,220
You owe him.

897
01:21:44,141 --> 01:21:45,740
A life for a life.

898
01:21:47,341 --> 01:21:48,661
I know what to do.

899
01:21:57,941 --> 01:22:01,460
We've induced coma.
Thankfully all his vitals have stabilised,

900
01:22:02,461 --> 01:22:05,501
but he should be moved to a facility
more suited to his needs.

901
01:22:06,382 --> 01:22:07,620
Out ofthe question.

902
01:22:08,422 --> 01:22:11,302
Doctor, someone from the outside
tried to kill him.

903
01:22:11,983 --> 01:22:15,181
Unless they think he's dead,
they'll come back to finish the job.

904
01:22:16,023 --> 01:22:18,902
Yeah, well, I can't pronounce a man dead
while he's still alive.

905
01:22:20,023 --> 01:22:21,021
Can't you?

906
01:22:30,503 --> 01:22:32,781
How are we doing
with finding a replacement for Parks?

907
01:22:33,103 --> 01:22:34,702
She comes highly recommended
from Halliburton.

908
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:37,582
She ran their maximum security
detention centre.

909
01:22:37,743 --> 01:22:40,303
She's strong. She's smart.
Ruthlessly ambitious.

910
01:22:40,624 --> 01:22:43,103
I think if I weren't around, she'd tell people
that Death Race was her idea

911
01:22:43,183 --> 01:22:44,943
and she'd convince them that it was.

912
01:22:45,224 --> 01:22:46,863
How's the switchover to the Internet?

913
01:22:46,943 --> 01:22:48,143
Transition's complete.

914
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:50,663
We start streaming live worldwide tomorrow.

915
01:22:51,905 --> 01:22:53,343
The numbers have
already surpassed pay-per-view,

916
01:22:53,424 --> 01:22:54,784
thanks to the Frankenstein commercial.

917
01:22:54,865 --> 01:22:55,983
Hold on. Wait.

918
01:22:56,145 --> 01:22:59,343
I've been meaning to talk to you
about this Frankenstein.

919
01:23:05,024 --> 01:23:06,704
Did you make him up?

920
01:23:08,465 --> 01:23:10,223
Frankenstein most certainly exists,

921
01:23:10,344 --> 01:23:12,144
and he will be in the race tomorrow.

922
01:23:14,026 --> 01:23:15,025
He better be.

923
01:23:16,305 --> 01:23:19,984
And he better come as good as advertised.

924
01:23:30,385 --> 01:23:32,943
The procedure's
experimental and dangerous.

925
01:23:33,025 --> 01:23:35,345
We're talking about placing
electrodes into the brain.

926
01:23:35,506 --> 01:23:36,945
You told me
he was a perfect candidate.

927
01:23:37,027 --> 01:23:38,066
Oh, he is.

928
01:23:38,187 --> 01:23:39,625
But there are no guarantees.

929
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:41,904
Let's wake him up.

930
01:23:54,227 --> 01:23:55,667
Mr. Lucas.

931
01:23:56,306 --> 01:24:00,306
You've got second-degree burns
over 85% of your body.

932
01:24:01,547 --> 01:24:05,387
Now, you're lucky that you suffered
no significant injuries.

933
01:24:05,587 --> 01:24:07,785
Not a broken bone or damaged organ,

934
01:24:08,307 --> 01:24:12,307
which is remarkable
considering the intensity of the fire.

935
01:24:18,508 --> 01:24:20,068
So, this is hell?

936
01:24:22,868 --> 01:24:23,947
Why?

937
01:24:26,069 --> 01:24:27,987
Where else would you be?

938
01:24:29,108 --> 01:24:30,746
You do rememberme.

939
01:24:32,748 --> 01:24:34,428
You win five races and you're free.

940
01:24:35,709 --> 01:24:37,428
You're out of your fucking mind.

941
01:24:38,589 --> 01:24:40,789
No more Markus Kane
trying to track you down.

942
01:24:41,909 --> 01:24:43,028
Like a second chance.

943
01:24:44,789 --> 01:24:46,068
Look at me.

944
01:24:46,428 --> 01:24:48,309
Really. Look at me.

945
01:24:54,549 --> 01:24:56,748
What kind of second chance would I have?

946
01:24:58,429 --> 01:25:00,827
You're either
Frankenstein or you're nobody.

947
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,708
You're certainly not Carl Lucas any more.

948
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:06,588
The entire world watched him incinerate.

949
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:09,550
There's even a death certificate.

950
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:11,669
I pityyou.

951
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:14,549
Okay.
If you don't do it for your life,

952
01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:16,950
then you do it for Katrina.

953
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:21,870
I'll furlough five of my worst sodomites
for a play date with sweet Katrina.

954
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:26,270
By the time they're finished with her,
she'll be lucky if she has a pulse.

955
01:26:21,513 --> 01:26:23,232
How do you feel, Mr. Lucas?

956
01:26:26,233 --> 01:26:27,192
The name

957
01:26:28,474 --> 01:26:29,753
is Frankenstein.

958
01:27:09,115 --> 01:27:10,394
Sorry to disappoint you.

959
01:27:11,076 --> 01:27:13,115
You're gonna have to settle
for the Mexican Jew.

960
01:27:14,476 --> 01:27:17,955
Three, two, one, and we're in.

961
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:21,915
Good evening, and welcome to Death Race.

962
01:27:22,316 --> 01:27:26,315
We're streaming live worldwide
for over 20 million viewers. This week...

963
01:27:26,396 --> 01:27:27,396
Yada, yada, yada.

964
01:27:27,516 --> 01:27:29,315
Cut in promos of the drivers
as soon as the light hits green,

965
01:27:29,436 --> 01:27:32,075
cut back to me, crane up,
chase out after Frankenstein. Got it?

966
01:27:32,155 --> 01:27:33,276
Yeah. It'll look good.

967
01:27:33,356 --> 01:27:34,795
Yeah, I know it's a great shot.

968
01:27:34,876 --> 01:27:36,636
It will be. We're live in five.

969
01:27:36,717 --> 01:27:38,076
Okay, time for one more.

970
01:27:38,556 --> 01:27:39,515
Go.

971
01:27:39,717 --> 01:27:40,716
Go!

972
01:27:44,837 --> 01:27:45,996
Where's Lists?

973
01:27:46,717 --> 01:27:48,517
Said he had some business to take care of.

974
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:29,597
Climb aboard.

975
01:28:59,041 --> 01:29:00,120
What?

976
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,321
You expecting another pretty boy?

977
01:29:37,283 --> 01:29:39,362
Good evening,
and welcome to Death Race.

978
01:29:39,643 --> 01:29:42,841
We're streaming live
to over 20 million viewers.

979
01:29:42,922 --> 01:29:45,561
This week, 14K attempts
to repeat as champion.

980
01:29:46,162 --> 01:29:48,601
But he'll have fierce competition
from several new drivers,

981
01:29:49,322 --> 01:29:51,402
including Frankenstein.

982
01:30:41,524 --> 01:30:42,524
What are you doing?

983
01:30:55,886 --> 01:30:57,205
Tell me who sent you.

984
01:31:08,406 --> 01:31:09,886
Good for you, Luke.

985
01:31:17,367 --> 01:31:18,845
Payback for Lucas.

986
01:31:29,768 --> 01:31:30,847
KATRINA: Oh, my God!

987
01:32:03,209 --> 01:32:05,288
Yes! The drinks are on me!

988
01:32:05,768 --> 01:32:06,888
Yes!

989
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:11,687
Move my tee-off time
from 9:00 to 10:00.

990
01:32:12,888 --> 01:32:14,248
You see that?

991
01:32:15,690 --> 01:32:17,128
That's a stupid bitch.

992
01:32:23,130 --> 01:32:24,649
Take care of your business?

993
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,689
I'm only sorry Luke didn't live to see this.

994
01:32:40,490 --> 01:32:42,410
I'm not so sure he didn't.

995
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:49,250
Frankenstein, huh?

996
01:32:50,252 --> 01:32:51,490
You got a real name?

997
01:32:55,931 --> 01:32:57,450
Uh-huh.

998
01:32:58,092 --> 01:32:59,451
Yeah, of course, I do.

999
01:33:11,052 --> 01:33:14,570
Live from Terminal Island,
television's most violent, most disturbing,

1000
01:33:14,651 --> 01:33:16,971
and most watched programme
in human history.

1001
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:19,772
Dim the lights.
The carnage is about to begin.

1002
01:33:19,852 --> 01:33:21,531
Welcome to Death Race.
