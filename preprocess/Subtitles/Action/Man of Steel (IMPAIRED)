02:12:07,553 --> 02:12:09,226
Courtside seats to the game tonight.

1456
02:12:09,655 --> 02:12:11,225
- What do you say?
- I say...

1457
02:12:11,457 --> 02:12:13,994
...you should go back
to trolling the intern pool.

1458
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:17,639
You'll probably have more luck. Sorry.

1459
02:12:19,432 --> 02:12:20,103
Courtside?

1460
02:12:20,332 --> 02:12:22,073
LOIS: Don't. Ha, ha, ha.
- No.

1461
02:12:22,301 --> 02:12:25,111
Lombard, Lane,
I want you to meet our new stringer.

1462
02:12:25,337 --> 02:12:28,580
I want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent.

1463
02:12:28,808 --> 02:12:30,116
Good luck, kid.

1464
02:12:31,644 --> 02:12:32,918
LOMBARD:
Hey. Steve.

1465
02:12:33,145 --> 02:12:34,419
- Nice to meet you.
LOMBARD: You too.

1466
02:12:34,647 --> 02:12:35,489
LOIS:
Hi.

1467
02:12:36,415 --> 02:12:37,758
Lois Lane.

1468
02:12:38,584 --> 02:12:40,120
Welcome to the Planet.

1469
02:12:43,856 --> 02:12:45,836
Glad to be here, Lois.

1470
