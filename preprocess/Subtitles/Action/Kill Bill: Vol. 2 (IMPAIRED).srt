1
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,480
[Man] Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,650
You know, Kiddo...

3
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,190
...I'd like to believe...

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,700
...you're aware enough, even now...

5
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,910
...to know that there's nothing sadistic...

6
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,160
...in my actions.

7
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,670
At this moment...

8
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,420
...this is me...

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,130
...at my most masochistic.

10
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,720
Bill.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,090
It's your ba...

12
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,060
[Woman] Looked dead, didn't I?

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,810
Well, I wasn't.

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,440
But it wasn't from lack of trying,
I can tell you that.

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,650
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma -

16
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,070
a coma I was to lie in for four years.

17
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,240
When I woke up, I went on what
the movie advertisements refer to as

18
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,790
"a roaring rampage of revenge."

19
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,920
I roared, and I rampaged,

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,540
and I got bloody satisfaction.

21
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,470
I've killed a hell of a lot of people
to get to this point,

22
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,800
but I've only one more.

23
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,930
The last one.

24
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,560
The one I'm driving to right now.

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,440
The only one left.

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,190
And when I arrive at my destination,

27
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,480
I am gonna kill Bill.

28
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,530
 [Instrumental] 

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,180
[Woman] The incident that happened
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel

30
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,430
that put this whole gory story into motion

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,140
has since become legend.

32
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,940
"Massacre at Two Pines."

33
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,980
That's what the newspapers called it.

34
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,900
The local TV news called it,

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,950
"The El Paso, Texas
Wedding Chapel Massacre."

36
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,740
How it happened, who was there,

37
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,740
how many got killed
and who killed them -

38
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,370
changes depending on
who's telling the story.

39
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,880
In actual fact, the massacre didn't
happen during a wedding at all.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,380
It was a wedding rehearsal.

41
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,970
Now, when we come
to the part where I say,

42
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,300
"You may kiss the bride,"
you may kiss the bride.

43
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,720
But don't stick your tongue in her mouth.

44
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,770
(Laughter)

45
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,940
This might be funny to your friends,

46
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,190
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.

47
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,860
(Laughter Continues)

48
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,940
We'll try to restrain ourselves, Reverend.

49
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,110
Y'all got a song?

50
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,000
How 'bout "Love Me Tender"?
I can play that.

51
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,040
- Sure.
- Yeah.

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,460
"Love Me Tender" would be great.

53
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,630
Rufus - he's the man.

54
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,760
Rufus, who was that
that you used to play for?

55
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
Rufus Thomas.

56
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,800
Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.

57
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,220
I was a Drell. I was a Drifter.
I was a Coaster.

58
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,890
I was part of the Gang.
I was a Barkay.

59
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,150
If they come through Texas,
I done played with 'em.

60
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,690
Rufus - he's the man.

61
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,950
- Have I forgotten anything?
- Um...

62
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,540
Oh yes, you forgot, uh,
the seating arrangements.

63
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,250
- Thank you, Mother.
- Yes.

64
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,540
Now, the way we normally do this -

65
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,710
we have the bride's side,
and then we have the groom's side.

66
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,010
But since the bride
ain't got nobody coming,

67
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,050
and the groom's got
far too many people coming...

68
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,350
Well, yeah, they're coming
all the way from Oklahoma.

69
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,310
Right...

70
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,350
Well, I don't see no problem with...

71
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,730
...the groom's side
sharing the bride's side.

72
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,820
- Do you, Mother?
- I don't have a problem with that.

73
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,690
But, uh...

74
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,990
Honey, you know, it would be good
if you had somebody come.

75
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,200
You know, as a sign of good faith?

76
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,210
Well, I don't have anybody...

77
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,250
...except for Tommy and my friends.

78
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,710
- You have no family?
- Well, I'm working on changing that.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,050
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family
this little angel's ever gonna need.

80
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,770
I'm not feeling very well,
and this bitch is starting to piss me off.

81
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,270
So while y'all blather on,
I'm gonna go outside and get some air.

82
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,480
OK. Um, uh, Reverend, sorry, uh...

83
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,150
- She's gonna go out and get some air.
- Yeah. Given her delicate condition...

84
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,900
She just needs a few minutes
to get it together. She'll be OK.

85
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,410
(Reverend) Right...

 [Flute] 

87
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,860
Hello, Kiddo.

88
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,700
- How did you find me?
- I'm the man.

89
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,580
What are you doing here?

90
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,170
What am I doing?

91
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,630
Well...

92
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,970
...moment ago I was playing my flute.

93
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,980
At this moment...

94
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,570
...I'm looking at the most beautiful bride
these old eyes have ever seen.

95
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,030
- Why are you here?
- Last look.

96
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,410
- Are you gonna be nice?
- I've never been nice in my whole life.

97
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,750
But I'll do my best to be sweet.

98
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,000
Hmm.

99
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,500
I always told you...

100
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,920
...your sweet side is you best side.

101
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,470
I guess that's why you're
the only one who's ever seen it.

102
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,270
- So you got a bun in the oven.
- Hmm.

103
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,820
- I'm knocked up.
- Jeez, Louise.

104
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,410
That young man of yours sure doesn't
believe in wasting time, does he?

105
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,030
Have you seen Tommy?

106
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,370
- Big guy in the tux?
- Yes.

107
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,580
Then I saw him.

108
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,840
I like his hair.

109
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,590
You promised you'd be nice.

110
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,470
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

111
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,560
But you're right.

112
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,730
What does your young man
do for a living?

113
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,480
He owns a used record store
here in El Paso.

114
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,240
- Ah. Music lover, eh?
- He's fond of music.

115
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,570
Aren't we all?

116
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,000
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

117
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,670
I work in the record store.

118
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,130
Aso.

119
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,300
It all suddenly seems so clear.

120
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,140
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. I like it a lot, smartass.

121
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,940
I get to listen to music all day...

122
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,020
...talk about music all day.
It's really cool.

123
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,530
It's gonna be a great environment
for my little girl to grow up in.

124
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,080
As opposed to jetting around the world,
killing human beings,

125
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,960
and being paid vast sums of money?

126
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,370
Precisely.

127
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,420
Well, my old friend...

128
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,880
...to each his own.

129
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,510
However, all cockblockery aside...

130
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,050
I am looking forward
to meeting your young man.

131
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,350
I happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

132
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,690
- You want to come to the wedding?
- Only if I can sit on the bride's side.

133
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,900
You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

134
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,410
Your side always was a bit lonely.

135
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,540
But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.

136
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,920
You know...

137
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,460
...I had the loveliest dream about you...

138
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,960
Oh, here's Tommy!
Call me Arlene.

139
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,340
- You must be Tommy!
- Uh-huh.

140
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,840
Arlene's told me so much about you.

141
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,720
- Honey, you OK?
- Oh, I'm fine.

142
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,890
Tommy, I'd like you to meet my father.

143
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,730
Oh, my God!

144
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,560
Oh, my God, this is great!

145
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,440
I'm so glad to meet you, sir... uh, Dad.

146
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,770
The name's Bill.

147
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,190
Well, it's great to meet you... Bill.

148
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,450
- Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
- Surprise.

149
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,780
That's my pop for ya.
Always full of surprises.

150
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,290
Well, in the surprise department...

151
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,710
...the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

152
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,960
- When did you get in?
- Just now.

153
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,130
- Did you come straight from Australia?
- Of course.

154
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,050
Daddy, I told Tommy that you were
in Perth mining for silver, and...

155
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,140
...no one could reach you.

156
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,510
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.

157
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,680
So...

158
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,520
What's this all about?
I've heard of wedding rehearsals,

159
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,820
but I don't believe I've ever heard of
a wedding dress rehearsal before.

160
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,230
We thought,

161
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,490
"Why pay so much money for a dress
you're only gonna wear once?"

162
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,570
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

163
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,370
So, I think we're gonna try to get
all the mileage we can out of it.

164
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,080
Isn't it supposed to be bad luck
for the groom to see the bride

165
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,170
in her wedding dress
before the ceremony?

166
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,590
Well, I guess I just believe
in living dangerously.

167
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,550
I know just what you mean.

168
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,850
(Reverend) Son.
Some of us have places to be.

169
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,560
[Rufus] Sure do.

170
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,020
Look, we got to go through this one
more time. So, why don't you have a s...

171
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,060
Oh, my God. What am I thinking?
You should give her away!

172
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,860
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

173
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,450
I think Father would be
much more comfortable

174
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:17,490
- sitting with the rest of the guests.
- Hmm. Really?

175
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,530
That's asking a lot.

176
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,830
Oh. OK.
Well, forget it.

177
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,670
But how about we go out
to dinner tonight to celebrate?

178
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,460
Only on the condition that
I pay for everything.

179
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,130
Deal. We got to do this now.

180
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,220
- Can I watch?
- Absolutely. Have a seat.

181
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,260
- Which is the bride's side?
- Right over here.

182
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,980
(Reverend) Mother, here we go!

183
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,690
Now son, about them vows...

184
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,740
 [Guitar] 

185
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,490
Bill...

186
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:03,040
- I just want...
- You don't owe me a damn thing.

187
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,660
If he's the man you want...

188
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,830
...then go stand by him.

189
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,190
- Do I look pretty?
- Oh, yes.

190
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,330
Thank you.

191
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,370
(Reverend) What the hell?

192
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,750
(Screaming)

193
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,830
[The Bride] No! Bill!

194
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,170
(Machine Gunfire)

195
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,170
(Barking)

196
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,670
(Bells Toll)

197
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
(Bird Chirps)

198
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:12,960
You telling me she cut her way through
88 bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?

199
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,290
Nah, there wasn't really 88 of 'em.

200
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,130
They just called themselves
"The Crazy 88"

201
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,340
- How come?
- I don't know.

202
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,590
I guess they thought it sounded cool.

203
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,310
Anyhow, they all fell
under her Hanzo sword.

204
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,350
- She got a Hanzo sword?
- He made one for her.

205
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,900
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

206
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,570
It would appear he has broken it.

207
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,490
Them Japs sure know how
to hold a grudge, don't they?

208
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,580
Or maybe...

209
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,080
...you just tend
to bring that out in people.

210
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,840
I know this is a ridiculous question
before I ask it,

211
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,510
but you haven't, by any chance,
kept up with your... swordplay?

212
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,050
I, um...

213
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,640
[Belches] I pawned that years ago.

214
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,100
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?

215
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,230
Yep.

216
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,270
It was priceless.

217
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,320
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

218
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,370
In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.

219
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,710
I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill.

220
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,040
(Sniffs)

221
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,000
If she wants to fight with me, all she's
got to do is come down to the club

222
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,800
and start some shit,
and we'll be in a fight.

223
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:50,390
I know we haven't spoken in some time,

224
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,270
and the last time we spoke
wasn't the most pleasant,

225
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:58,770
but you've got to get over
being mad at me,

226
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,980
and start becoming afraid of (Bleep),

227
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,780
because she is coming,
and she's coming to kill you.

228
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,160
And unless you accept my assistance,
I have no doubt she will succeed.

229
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,090
I don't dodge guilt, and I don't Jew
out of paying my comeuppance.

230
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,680
Can't we just... forget the past?

231
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,600
That woman...

232
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,850
...deserves her revenge.

233
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,820
And...

234
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,700
...we deserve to die.

235
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,580
But then again...

236
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,750
...so does she.

237
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,790
So I guess...

238
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,250
...we'll just see.

239
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,430
Won't we?

240
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,160
 [Distant Music] 

241
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,080
 [Spanish Music] 

242
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,670
Late again.

243
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,970
Budd, can't you tell time?

244
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,840
There ain't nobody in here, man.

245
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,260
- [Man] Is that Budd?
- Yeah.

246
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,310
[Man] Tell him to get
his fucking ass back here!

247
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,270
OK.

248
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,600
Budd, Larry'd like a word with ya.

249
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,030
Take a hit.
Be somebody, baby.

250
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,750
You looking for me?

251
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,300
I don't know what car wash
you worked before you came here

252
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,720
that let you stroll in 20 minutes late,
but it wasn't owned by me

253
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,470
- and I own a fucking car wash.
- Do you want me to leave?

254
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,680
No, I don't want you to leave.
I want you to sit and wait.

255
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,980
Larry...

256
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,980
...there ain't nobody out there, so...

257
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,490
(Slurring) "There's nobody
out there, Larry."

258
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,820
What's your point?

259
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,490
- That you're not needed here?
- My point is...

260
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,210
...I'm the bouncer, and there
ain't nobody out there to bounce.

261
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,540
You saying that the reason...

262
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,460
...that you're not doing the job that I'm...

263
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,010
...paying you to do is that
you don't have a job to do?

264
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,640
- No...
- Is that what you're saying?

265
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,640
What are you trying
to convince me of, exactly?

266
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,640
That you're as useless
as an asshole right here?

267
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,060
Well, guess what, buddy?

268
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:32,320
I think... you just fucking convinced me.

269
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,570
Let's go to the calendar.

270
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,910
It's calendar time.

271
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,490
Calendar time for Buddy.

272
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,000
- OK. You working tomorrow?
- Yeah.

273
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,130
Mm. No, you're n... You don't even know
what fucking day you work.

274
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,210
Here. You're not working tomorrow.

275
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,510
You're working Wednesday.
Here you are. There you go.

276
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,630
- Working Thursday?
- Yeah.

277
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,010
I don't think so.
Friday.

278
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,100
I d... There's your name.

279
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,140
- If you say so.
- There used to be your name. OK?

280
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,060
- Saturday. There used to be your name.
- Oh.

281
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,150
Uh, Monday...

282
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,730
Here. How about that?

283
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,570
fucking with your cash is the only thing
you kids seem to understand. OK?

284
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,280
Now, I want you to go home till I call you.

285
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,700
Till I call you.

286
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,710
Before you leave, talk to Rocket.
She's got a job for you to do.

287
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,170
And...

288
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,960
...the hat.

289
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,920
That fucking hat.

290
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,840
That fucking...

291
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,890
How many times have I told you,

292
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,890
don't wear that fucking hat here?
How many?

293
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,940
Customers wear hats.

294
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,690
Well, I'm not the boss of the customers.

295
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,700
I'm the boss of you.
And I'm telling you...

296
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,660
...that I want you to keep
that shit-kicker hat at home.

00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,320
Yeah. Budd, honey, uh,
the toilet is at it again.

300
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,410
There's shitty water all over the floor.

301
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,290
OK... Rocket.

302
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,000
- I'll clean it up.
- Mm-hmm.

483
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,420
 [Flute] 

484
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,140
So began...

485
00:41:54,230 --> 00:42:00,020
...the Massacre of the Shoaling Temple,
and all sixty of the monks inside,

486
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,530
at the fists of the White Lotus.

487
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:07,450
And... so began the legend...

488
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:11,910
...of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

489
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:14,200
And what, pray tell,
is the Five-Point-Palm

490
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,920
- Exploding-Heart Technique?
- Quite simply,

491
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:22,090
the deadliest blow in all of martial arts.

492
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:27,090
He hits you with his fingertips...

493
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,100
...at five different pressure
points on your body...

494
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,180
...and then lets you walk away.

495
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,230
But once you've taken five steps...

496
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:42,320
...your heart explodes inside your body...

497
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,490
...and you fall to the floor, dead.

498
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,660
- Did he teach you that?
- No.

499
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,000
He teaches no one the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

500
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,120
Now...

501
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,460
...one of the things
I've always liked about you...

502
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,550
...Kiddo...

503
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,970
...is you appear
wise beyond your years.

504
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,310
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise:

505
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,980
Whatever...

506
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,020
...whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

507
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,570
If you flash him, even for an instant,
a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.

508
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,910
And if you throw any
American sass his way...

509
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:37,160
...he'll snap your back and your neck
like they were twigs.

510
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,420
And that will be the story of you.

511
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:49,170
 [Flute] 

512
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:06,230
He'll accept you as his student.

513
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,400
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

514
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:11,610
- Get in a fight?
- Friendly contest.

515
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,160
Why did he accept me?

516
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,490
Because he's a very, very, very old man.

517
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:20,790
And like all rotten bastards...

518
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:26,000
...when they become old,
they get lonely.

519
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:29,090
Which has no effect
on their dispositions,

520
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:33,890
but it does teach them
the value of company.

521
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:36,430
Whew. Oh.

522
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,430
(Sighs) Just seeing those
steps again makes me ache.

523
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,400
You're gonna have a lot of fun

524
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,320
carrying buckets of water
up and down that fucker.

525
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,910
When will I see you again?

526
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:57,490
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the seventies.

527
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,330
- What?
- Nothing.

528
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,830
When he tells me you're done.

529
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,580
When do you think that might be?

530
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,630
That, my dearest,
depends entirely on you.

531
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:11,340
Now remember,
no sarcasm, no backtalk.

532
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,680
At least not for the first year or so.

533
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,970
You're gonna have to let him
warm up to you.

534
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:20,890
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

535
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:23,730
and has nothing
but contempt for women.

536
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,520
So in your case...
it might take a little while.

537
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:33,200
- Adiós.
- (Engine Starts)

538
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,630
Master...

539
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,130
Your Mandarin is lousy.

540
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,510
It causes my ears discomfort.

541
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,140
You bray like an ass!

542
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:24,140
You are not to speak unless spoken to.

543
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:28,640
Is it too much to hope...
you understand Cantonese?

544
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,770
I speak Japanese very well...

545
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,110
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese...

546
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,360
I asked if you understand Cantonese?

547
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:41,910
A little.

548
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:47,160
You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics.

549
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,660
If you can't understand me...

550
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:51,250
I will communicate with you
like I would a dog.

551
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,050
When I yell, when I point,
when I beat you with my stick!

552
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:02,970
Bill is your master, is he not?

553
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,350
Yes, he is.

554
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,520
Your master tells me...
you're not entirely unschooled.

555
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,820
What training do you possess?

556
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,280
I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style,

557
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:22,360
and I am more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai sword.

558
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,700
(Scoffs)

559
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,240
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
Don't make me laugh!

560
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:31,410
Your so-called exquisite art,
is only fit for...

561
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,330
Japanese fat heads!

562
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,920
(Laughs)

563
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:43,640
Your anger amuses me.
Do you believe you are my match?

564
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:44,760
No.

565
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,560
Are you aware I kill at will?

566
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,310
Yes.

567
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,230
Is it your wish to die?

568
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:51,980
No.

569
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:54,060
(Laughs)

570
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:55,150
Then you must be stupid...

571
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,570
Then you must be stupid... so stupid.

572
00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:01,280
Rise, and let me look at your
ridiculous face.

573
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,950
Rise.

574
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:13,080
So my pathetic friend...
Is there anything that you can do well?

575
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,920
What's the matter?

576
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,250
Cat got your tongue?

577
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,720
- Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

578
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,760
I despise the Goddamn Japs!

579
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,510
Go to that rack.

580
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,860
Remove the sword.

581
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,910
(Whooshes)

582
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,010
Let's see how good you really are.

583
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:09,510
If...

584
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,890
...you land a single blow,

585
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,350
I'll bow down and call you master.

586
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,310
(Whipping)

587
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,110
(Grunts)

588
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,740
(Grunts)

589
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:28,070
(Grunting)

590
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,990
From here you can get
an excellent view of my foot.

591
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,160
(Thud)

592
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,580
(Laughs)

593
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:40,590
Your swordsmanship...
is amateur at best.

594
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,210
(Whipping)

595
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,090
(Grunting)

596
00:50:54,770 --> 00:51:00,110
Your so-called kung-fu... is really...
quite pathetic.

597
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:06,650
I asked you to demonstrate...
what you know... and you did...

598
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,570
Not a goddamn thing!

599
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:13,290
Let's see your Tiger Crane...
match my Eagle's Claw.

600
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,460
(Whooshes)

601
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:30,470
(Grunting)

602
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,770
(Grunts)

603
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,570
(Grunting)

604
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,990
(Grunts & Laughs)

605
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,250
(Grunting Continues)

606
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,170
(Laughs)

607
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,250
(Screams)

608
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,340
(Screams)

609
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,390
Like all Yankee women...

610
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:15,930
...all you can do is order in restaurants
and spend a man's money.

611
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,730
Excruciating... isn't it?

612
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,060
Yes!

613
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,020
If it was my wish...

614
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,860
...I could chop your arm off.

615
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,190
No, please don't!

616
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:27,570
(Laughs)

617
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,950
It's my arm now. I can do what I please.

618
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,820
If you can stop me... I suggest you try.

619
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,950
(Screams)

620
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,030
I can't.

621
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,450
Because you're helpless?

622
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:40,210
Yes.

623
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,960
Have you ever felt this before?

624
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:46,170
No.

625
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:49,840
Compared to me... you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle?

626
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,010
YES!!!

627
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:54,970
THAT'S THE BEGINNING!

628
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:03,310
Is it your wish to possess
this kind of power?

629
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:07,650
Yes!

630
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,990
Your training will begin... tomorrow.

631
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,080
(Yells)

632
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,120
Since your arm now belongs to me...

633
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,330
...I want it strong.

634
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,340
Can you do that?

635
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:30,670
I can, but not that close.

636
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,170
Then you can't do it.

637
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:37,180
What if your enemy...
is three inches in front of you...

638
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,510
...What do you do then...

639
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,730
...Curl into a ball...

640
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,690
...or do you put your FIST through him?

641
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,020
Now begin.

642
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:58,700
(Grunts)

643
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,080
(Grunts)

644
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,460
(Grunts)

645
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,630
(Grunts)

646
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,350

compare to that?

a little bit longer so they can do it.

716

I've always figured that...

717
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,890
...warriors and their enemies...

718
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:13,640
...share the same relationship.

I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both.

727

...more than you feel the other.

728
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:52,510
And the question was:
Which one is it?

729
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,850
Regret.

01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,360
(Grunts)

811
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:00,080
Hi-ya!

812
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,640
"To my brother, Budd.
The only man I ever loved. Bill."

813
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,570
What's that?

814
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:32,570
Budd's Hanzo sword.

815
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:35,120
He said he pawned it.

816
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:38,830
Guess that makes him
a liar now, don't it?

817
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,170
- Elle?
- Bea.

818
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:49,210
Something I've always
been curious about.

819
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:52,930
Just between us girls...

820
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:57,430
...what did you say to Pai Mei
to make him snatch out your eye?

821
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:00,230
(Screams) Ow!

822
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:04,400
I called him a miserable old fool.

823
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:08,570
Ooh. Bad idea.

824
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:11,400
Know what I did?

825
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:15,660
I killed that miserable old fool.

826
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:20,540
[Elle] How do you like the fish head,
you miserable old fool?

827
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:23,000
I poisoned his fish heads.

828
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,540
Elle, you treacherous dog.

829
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:29,550
(Elle laughs)

830
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:33,470
I - give - you - my - word...

831
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:35,090
[Elle] And I told him,

832
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:39,060
"To me, the word
of an old fool like you

833
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:43,190
is worth less than nothing."

834
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:44,770
(Laughs)

835
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:50,070
That's right.

836
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:52,110
I killed your master.

837
01:18:52,150 --> 01:18:54,780
And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

838
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:57,530
With your own sword, no less.

839
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:03,870
Which, in the very immediate future,
will become my sword.

840
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,040
Bitch...

841
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:10,710
...you don't have a future.

842
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:42,330

(Screaming)

844
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:02,350
(Screaming) Fucking bitch!

845
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,770
(Screaming) Fucking bitch!

846
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:17,700
(Screaming) I'll kill you!
You're fucking dead!

847
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:23,200
(Screaming) You bitch! You bitch!

848
01:20:23,290 --> 01:20:26,790
(Moaning & Screaming)

849
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:30,000
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!

850
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,500
(Hisses)

851
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:36,920
(Screaming) Oh, I'll get you!

852
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:39,970
I'm gonna...

853
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:43,010
(Screaming) Where are you?
Lemme fucking at you!

854
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:45,100
(Continues Screaming)

855
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:48,980
Where are you?
I'm coming, you fucking bitch!

856
01:20:49,060 --> 01:20:51,900
(Screaming) You're fucking dead!
You're dead!

857
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,360
(Continues Screaming)

858
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,240
(cries) Oh... shit!

859
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:03,330
(Screaming)

860
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:07,450

861

 [Choral Music] 

 [Male Singing In Spanish] 

863
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:26,870
[The Bride] Like most men
who never knew their father,

864
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:29,700
Bill collected father figures.

865
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:32,750
The first was Esteban Vihaio.

866
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:36,920
Esteban was a pimp
and a friend of Bill's mother.

867
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,090
He ran a brothel in Acuna, Mexico
for over 50 years.

868
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:43,470
His army, the Acuna Boys,

869
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:47,930
made up of the fatherless offspring
of his whores, ran Acuna.

870
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:50,970
He ran the Acuna Boys.

871
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:57,190
Now, at the age of 80, it would be
this retired gentleman of leisure

872
01:22:57,270 --> 01:23:00,280
who could point me in Bill's direction.

873
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,610
Señor Esteban Vihaio?

874
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:07,490
Yes.

875
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:09,530
May I join you?

876
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:14,790
Only on the condition
that you call me Esteban.

877
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:19,040
- May I join you, Esteban?
- Please.

878
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:25,300
Americana?

879
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:27,050
Yes.

880
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:29,760
I speak a little Spanish, if you prefer.

881
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:33,430
No, no, no, no.
I prefer English.

882
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,060
I haven't spoken it in a while,

883
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:39,480
but I would relish
the opportunity to converse

884
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:42,440
with such a pretty
companion as yourself.

885
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:46,910
It's my pleasure to be in the company
of such a fine gentleman as yourself.

886
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:49,910
I must warn you, young lady...

887
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:52,950
...I am susceptible to flattery.

888
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,040
How may I be of service to you?

889
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:08,140
Where's Bill?

890
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:13,100
Ahh.

891
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:15,230
You must be Beatrix.

892
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:19,440
I can see the attraction.

893
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:27,490
I remember when Bill was only
five years old, I took him to the movies.

894
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:31,240
It was a movie starring Lana Turner.

895
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:36,370
The Postman Always Ring Twice,
with John Garfields.

896
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:39,750
And whenever she would
appear on the screen,

897
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:45,460
Bill would begin compulsively to
suck his thumb to an obscene amount.

898
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:51,090
And I knew from this very moment,
this boy was a fool for blonds.

899
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,690
Mmm.

900
01:24:58,770 --> 01:25:00,440
You know...

901
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:04,320
...being a fool for a woman
such as yourself...

902
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,820
...is always the right thing to do.

903
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:14,830
If we had met when I was
back in business...

904
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:19,460
...you would have been
my number one lady.

905
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:25,500
- Well, I'm flattered.
- You goddamn well better be.

906
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:32,430
This... I heard you were driving a truck.

907
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:34,430
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

908
01:25:35,390 --> 01:25:38,480
The Pussy died. Hmm.

909
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:44,110
Bill shot you in the head, no?

910
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:46,780
- Yes.
- Hmm.

911
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:51,150
I would have been much nicer.

912
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:53,530
I would have just cut your face.

913
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,200
You must forgive me.

914
01:25:58,290 --> 01:26:00,710
Please... you have a drink with me.

915
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:08,340
Clara! (Smooches)

916
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,590
Coming.

917
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:16,220
Dos añejo.

918
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:19,470
(Mumbles)

919
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:30,240
Gracias.

920
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:38,580
What were we talking about?

921
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,920
Bill.

922
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:52,630
- Where's Bill?
- Where's Bill.

923
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:55,260
Yeah. Hmm.

924
01:26:55,300 --> 01:27:00,770
Bill is at the Villa Quatro,
on the road to Salina.

925
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:03,140
I will draw you a map.

926
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:07,020
Bill is like a son to me.

927
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:12,650
- Do you know why I help you?
- No.

928
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:14,650
Because he would want me to.

929
01:27:16,110 --> 01:27:18,620
Now, that I don't believe.

930
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:21,120
Ahh.

931
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:25,670
How else is he ever
going to see you again?

932
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:35,280
Freeze, Mommy.

933
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,360
Bang, bang! Oh!

934
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:39,700
Oh! She got us, B.B.

935
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:42,700
Mommy got us.
Oh, I'm dying!

936
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:46,040
(Groaning) I'm dying.

937
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:50,960
Fall down, sweetheart.
Mommy shot us.

938
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:59,010
But little did Quickdraw Kiddo know
that little B.B. was only playing possum,

939
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:04,140
due to the fact that
she was impervious to bullets.

940
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,270
I am pervious to bullets, Mommy.

941
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:09,980
Hey, get back down there.
You're playing possum.

942
01:29:10,150 --> 01:29:15,780
So, as the smirking killer
advanced on what she thought

943
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:21,280
was a bullet-ridden corpse,
that's when little B.B. fired.

944
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:24,530
Bang, bang!

945
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:36,710
You're dead, Mommy.
So die.

946
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,260
Oh!

947
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:43,390
B.B.

948
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:51,190
Oh! B. B...

949
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:53,520
(Grunts)

950
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:56,730
I should've known.

951
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:00,110
You are... the best.

952
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,700
Oh, Mommy.
Don't die.

953
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:12,370
I was just playing.

954
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:19,130
I know.

955
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:36,230
I told her that you were asleep...

956
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:41,240
...but that one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.

957
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:45,530
And she asked me, "If Mommy's
been asleep since I was born,

958
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:48,290
then how will she know what I look like?"

959
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:55,040
To which I replied, "Because
Mommy's been dreaming of you."

960
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,920
That's what I said.

961
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,260
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.

962
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:07,010
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.

963
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:10,140
I waited a long time
for you to wake up, Mommy.

964
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,320
Now, let me look at you.

965
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:27,370
Oh.

966
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:35,420
My, my, my,
what a pretty little girl you are.

967
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:37,210
You're pretty too, Mommy.

968
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:47,140
Tell Mommy what you said
when I showed you her picture.

969
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:48,300
Mnh-mnh.

970
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:51,100
- Come on, shy girl.
- Mnh-mnh.

971
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:53,810
Come on. You know what you said.

972
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:58,150
Come on. Tell Mommy.
It'll make her feel good. Come on.

973
01:31:58,230 --> 01:32:00,650
- Mnh-mnh.
- Yeah. Come on.

974
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:03,240
I said... I said,

975
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:09,490
"You're the most beautifulest woman
I ever saw in the whole wide world."

976
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:14,910
That's the truth.
That's what she said.

977
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:21,710
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
prettiest hair in the whole wide world?

978
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,630
- Yes, I do.
- Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.

979
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:31,850
- What's better than pretty?
- Mmm... Gorgeous.

980
01:32:31,890 --> 01:32:36,690
Very good. Gorgeous.
Mommy is gorgeous.

981
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:44,610
Hmm. You know, sweetie,
Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

982
01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:47,570
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?

983
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:52,080
I'm afraid I was.
I was a real bad daddy.

984
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:57,620
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.

985
01:32:57,710 --> 01:33:02,540
Wanna tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?

986
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:07,220
I killed him.

987
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:12,390
- Emilio was her goldfish.
- Emilio was my goldfish.

988
01:33:12,430 --> 01:33:17,100
She came running into my room,
holding the fish in her hand and crying,

989
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:20,150
"Daddy. Daddy.
Emilio's dead."

990
01:33:21,860 --> 01:33:25,900
And I said, "Really? That's so sad.

991
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:28,150
How did he die?"

992
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:31,320
- And what did you say?
- I stepped on him.

993
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:36,660
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were,

994
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:40,670
"I accidentally stepped on him."

995
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:42,670
To which I queried,

996
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:48,220
"And just how did your foot accidentally
find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?"

997
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:52,590
And she said, "No, no, no. Emilio was
on the carpet when I stepped on him."

998
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:56,600
Mmm. The plot thickens.

999
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:01,520
"And just how did Emilio
get on the carpet?"

1000
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,940
And Mommy, you would've been
so proud of her.

1001
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,400
She didn't lie.

1002
01:34:09,490 --> 01:34:13,660
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl...

1003
01:34:13,740 --> 01:34:17,240
...and put him on the carpet.

1004
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:22,870
And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet?

1005
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,750
Flapping.

1006
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:29,670
- And then you stomped on him.
- Uh-huh.

1007
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,550
And when you lifted up your foot...

1008
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:37,680
...what was Emilio doing then?
- Nothing.

1009
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:40,560
He stopped flapping, didn't he?

1010
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:45,520
She told me later...

1011
01:34:45,610 --> 01:34:47,900
...that the second she lifted up her foot

1012
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:52,200
and saw Emilio not flapping,
she knew what she had done.

1013
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:57,370
Is that not the perfect
visual image of life and death?

1014
01:34:57,410 --> 01:35:02,540
A fish flapping on the carpet,
and a fish not flapping on the carpet.

1015
01:35:04,710 --> 01:35:10,760
So powerful, even a four-year-old
with no concept of life or death...

1016
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:13,470
...knew what it meant.

1017
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:17,260
- You loved Emilio, didn't you?
- Uh-huh.

1018
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:20,270
Well... I love Mommy, too.

1019
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:23,980
But I did to Mommy
what you did to Emilio.

1020
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:28,020
- You stomped on Mommy?
- Worse.

1021
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:30,190
I shot Mommy.

1022
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:33,450
Not pretend shooting
like we were just doing.

1023
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:35,160
I shot her for real.

1024
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:37,700
Why? Did you want to see
what would happen?

1025
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:42,540
No, I knew what would happen
to Mommy if I shot her.

1026
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:47,130
What I didn't know was, when I shot
Mommy, what would happen to me.

1027
01:35:47,170 --> 01:35:50,840
- What happened?
- I was very sad.

1028
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:55,430
And that's when I learned...

1029
01:35:55,470 --> 01:36:00,560
...some things, once you do,
they can never be undone.

1030
01:36:03,730 --> 01:36:08,860
- What happened to Mommy?
- Why don't you ask Mommy?

1031
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:12,110
You OK, Mommy?
Did it hurt?

1032
01:36:12,190 --> 01:36:15,860
No, sweetie.

1033
01:36:15,990 --> 01:36:18,370
Doesn't hurt anymore.

1034
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Did it make you sick?

1035
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:31,670
No. It made me sleep.

1036
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:34,460
That's why I haven't been with you, B.B.
I've been asleep.

1037
01:36:34,510 --> 01:36:38,260
But you're awake now, Mommy. Right?

1038
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:41,470
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

1039
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:46,810
B.B., would you like Mommy to watch
a video with you before sleepy time?

1040
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:48,350
Uh-huh.

1041
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:52,190
Mommy, do you wanna watch
a video with me before sleepy time?

1042
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:54,990
Oh, yeah!
I would love to.

1043
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:57,860
- Which one do you wanna watch?
- Shogun Assassin.

1044
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:00,280
No, B.B.
Shogun Assassin is too long.

1045
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:04,330
- Mnh-mnh.
- No, it's not.

1046
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:08,710
Well, then, I'll leave you ladies to it.

1047
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:21,010
[Boy] When I was little,
my father was famous.

1048
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:25,390
He was the greatest samurai
in the empire.

1049
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:28,770
And he was the shogun's decapitator.

1050
01:37:28,850 --> 01:37:34,110
He cut off the heads of 131 lords.

1051
01:37:34,190 --> 01:37:38,650
My father would come home to Mother
and when he would see her,

1052
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:41,410
he would forget about the killings.

1053
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:46,660
He wasn't scared of the shogun,
but the shogun was scared of him.

1054
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:49,410
Maybe that was the problem.

1055
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:52,330
One night, the shogun sent...

1056
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:57,010
 ["About Her"By Malcolm Clarine] 

1057
01:38:05,140 --> 01:38:10,480
 My man got a heart 

1058
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:17,610
 Like the rock that's in the sea 

1059
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:30,410
 Well, no one told me about her 

1060
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:33,460
 The way she lied 

1061
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:42,550
 Well, no one told me about her 

1062
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:45,890
 How many people cried 

1063
01:38:54,770 --> 01:39:00,400
 My man got a heart 

1064
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:07,450
 Like the rock that's in the sea 

1065
01:39:07,490 --> 01:39:12,870
 My man got a heart 

1066
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:20,460
 Like the rock that's in the sea 

1067
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:32,770
 Well, no one told me about her 

1068
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:36,020
 The way she lied 

1069
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:44,910
 Well, no one told me about her 

1070
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:48,530
 How many people cried 

1071
01:39:49,370 --> 01:39:55,500
 But it's too late to say you're sorry 

1072
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:58,130
 How would I know? 

1073
01:39:58,210 --> 01:40:02,010
 Why should I care? 

1074
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:07,760
 Please don't bother trying to find her 

1075
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:12,560
 She's not there 

1076
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:16,980
I was just admiring your sword.

1077
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:20,610
Quite a piece of work.

1078
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:24,900
Speaking of which, how is Hanzo-san?

1079
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:26,910
He's good.

1080
01:40:28,990 --> 01:40:31,950
Has his sushi gotten any better?

1081
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:39,880
You know, I couldn't believe it.
You got him to make you a sword.

1082
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,260
It was easy.
I just dropped your name, Bill.

1083
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:46,420
That'd do it.

1084
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:05,650
 Well, no one told me about her 

1085
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:16,580
 Well, no one told me about her 

1086
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:22,920
I suppose the idea is we cross
Hanzo swords. Am I right?

1087
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:26,550
Well,

1088
01:41:26,630 --> 01:41:31,890
it just so happens this hacienda
has its own private beach.

1089
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:36,140
And that private beach just so happens
to look particularly beautiful

1090
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:39,230
bathed in moonlight.

1091
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:42,060
And there just so happens to be
a full moon out tonight.

1092
01:41:42,150 --> 01:41:48,900
So, sword-fighter, if you want
a sword-fight, that's where I suggest.

1093
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:53,240
But if you wanna be old school about it...

1094
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:56,910
...and you know
I'm all about old school...

1095
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,710
...then we could wait until dawn
and slice each other up at sunrise

1096
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:03,040
like a couple of real-life honest...

1097
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:10,220
Now, if you don't settle down, I'm gonna
have to put one in your kneecap.

1098
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:13,600
And I hear tell that's
a very painful place to get shot in.

1099
01:42:15,680 --> 01:42:19,430
(Laughing) I'm just fucking with you.

1100
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:23,400
Now...

1101
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:26,020
...when it comes to you...

1102
01:42:26,150 --> 01:42:28,110
...and us...

1103
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:32,950
...I have a few unanswered questions.

1104
01:42:32,990 --> 01:42:39,450
So, before this tale of bloody revenge
reaches its climax,

1105
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:44,790
I'm gonna ask you some questions,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

1106
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:49,130
However, therein lies a dilemma.

1107
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:51,680
Because when it comes
to the subject of me,

1108
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:57,140
I believe you are truly and utterly
incapable of telling the truth.

1109
01:42:57,220 --> 01:43:01,560
Especially to me.
And least of all, to yourself.

1110
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:05,110
And when it comes to the subject of me,

1111
01:43:05,190 --> 01:43:11,990
I am truly and utterly incapable
of believing anything you say.

1112
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:14,070
How do you suppose
we solve this dilemma?

1113
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:15,910
Well,

1114
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:17,990
it just so happens,

1115
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:20,200
I have a solution.

1116
01:43:20,290 --> 01:43:22,710
- Aah!
- Gotcha!

1117
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:24,920
(Grunting) Goddamn!

1118
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,420
(Laughs)

1119
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:30,880
What the fuck
did you just shoot me with?

1120
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,680
My greatest invention.
Or at least my favorite.

1121
01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:38,350
Don't touch it, or I'll stick another one
right in your cheek.

1122
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:49,320
What lies within that dart, just begging
to course its way through your veins...

1123
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:53,950
...is an incredibly potent
and quite infallible truth serum.

1124
01:43:54,030 --> 01:43:57,120
I call it "The Undisputed Truth."

1125
01:43:57,200 --> 01:44:02,620
Twice as strong as sodium pentothal,
with no druggie aftereffects.

1126
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:08,460
Except for a slight wave of euphoria.
You feel it?

1127
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:11,550
- Euphoria?
- Yeah.

1128
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:14,590
- No.
- Too bad.

1129
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:18,010
As you know...

1130
01:44:18,090 --> 01:44:21,560
...I'm quite keen on comic books.

1131
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:25,230
Especially the ones about superheroes.

1132
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:30,860
I find the whole mythology
surrounding superheroes fascinating.

1133
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:35,530
Take my favorite superhero, Superman.

1134
01:44:35,650 --> 01:44:38,660
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well-drawn.

1135
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:42,040
Mmm.

1136
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:44,500
But the mythology...

1137
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:47,960
The mythology is not only great,
it's unique.

1138
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,300
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?

1139
01:44:52,340 --> 01:44:56,300
About two minutes. Just long enough
for me to finish my point.

1140
01:44:56,340 --> 01:45:01,510
Now, a staple of the superhero
mythology is,

1141
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:04,600
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.

1142
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:08,900
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,
Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.

1143
01:45:10,110 --> 01:45:13,940
When that character wakes up
in the morning, he's Peter Parker.

1144
01:45:14,030 --> 01:45:19,200
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.

1145
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:25,080
And it is in that characteristic
Superman stands alone.

1146
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:28,000
Superman didn't become Superman.

1147
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:30,750
Superman was born Superman.

1148
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:35,170
When Superman wakes up
in the morning, he's Superman.

1149
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:37,760
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

1150
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,930
His outfit with the big red "S" -

1151
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:45,720
that's the blanket he was wrapped in
as a baby when the Kents found him.

1152
01:45:45,770 --> 01:45:48,640
Those are his clothes.

1153
01:45:48,730 --> 01:45:53,940
What Kent wears - the glasses,
the business suit - that's the costume.

1154
01:45:54,020 --> 01:46:00,200
That's the costume Superman wears
to blend in with us.

1155
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:03,660
Clark Kent is how Superman views us.

1156
01:46:03,740 --> 01:46:07,000
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?

1157
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,410
He's weak...

1158
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:12,330
...he's unsure of himself...

1159
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:14,130
...he's a coward.

1160
01:46:15,210 --> 01:46:20,130
Clark Kent is Superman's critique
on the whole human race.

1161
01:46:21,930 --> 01:46:26,640
Sorta like Beatrix Kiddo
and Mrs. Tommy Plimpton.

1162
01:46:27,850 --> 01:46:30,100
Aso.

1163
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:32,350
The point emerges.

1164
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:37,570
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plimpton.

1165
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:41,450
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

1166
01:46:41,490 --> 01:46:46,450
And every morning when you woke up,
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

1167
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:48,700
Oh, you can... take the needle out.

1168
01:46:56,090 --> 01:46:58,340
Are you calling me a superhero?

1169
01:46:58,420 --> 01:47:00,550
I'm calling you a killer.

1170
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:03,510
A natural born killer.

1171
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:07,220
You always have been,
and you always will be.

1172
01:47:07,310 --> 01:47:09,520
Moving to El Paso...

1173
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,980
...working in a used record store...

1174
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:15,560
...going to the movies with Tommy...

1175
01:47:15,650 --> 01:47:17,150
...clipping coupons.

1176
01:47:17,230 --> 01:47:19,070
That's you...

1177
01:47:19,150 --> 01:47:22,610
...trying to disguise yourself
as a worker bee.

1178
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:25,740
That's you trying to blend in with the hive.

1179
01:47:25,820 --> 01:47:28,240
But you're not a worker bee.

1180
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:32,080
You're a renegade killer bee.

1181
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:34,920
And no matter how much beer you drank
or barbecue you ate

1182
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,340
or how fat your ass got,

1183
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:42,260
nothing in the world
would ever change that.

1184
01:47:44,680 --> 01:47:46,720
First question:

1185
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:54,310
Did you really think your life in El Paso
was gonna work?

1186
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:01,990
No!

1187
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:08,120
But I would've had B.B.!

1188
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,910
Don't get me wrong.

1189
01:48:10,990 --> 01:48:14,870
I think you would have been
a wonderful mother.

1190
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,460
But you are a killer.

1191
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:24,380
All those people you killed to get to me...

1192
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:26,970
...felt damn good, didn't they?

1193
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:31,600
Yes.

1194
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:33,980
Every single one of them?

1195
01:48:44,240 --> 01:48:45,990
Yes.

1196
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:51,910
That was the warm-up round.

1197
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:57,290
Now comes the $64,000 question.

1198
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:07,590
Why did you run away
from me with my baby?

1199
01:49:11,430 --> 01:49:14,850
Do you remember the last assignment
you sent me on?

1200
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:17,350
Of course.

1201
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,480
Lisa Wong.

1202
01:49:20,810 --> 01:49:23,360
The morning I left, I was sick.

1203
01:49:25,030 --> 01:49:27,700
On the plane, I threw up.

1204
01:49:29,530 --> 01:49:33,410
So I started thinking:

1205
01:49:33,490 --> 01:49:35,620
Maybe I was pregnant.

1206
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:40,170
"Easy to use. Remove cap and urinate
on the absorbent end for five seconds.

1207
01:49:42,380 --> 01:49:44,880
"Accurate results in only 90 seconds.

1208
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:48,430
You can read the results as soon as
the line appears in the window."

1209
01:49:48,510 --> 01:49:49,590
(Sighs)

1210
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:51,890
(Clock Ticking)

1211
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:25,840
Fuck.

1212
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:28,090
[The Bride] What I didn't know...

1213
01:50:28,170 --> 01:50:32,260
...was that somewhere on my journey
I had been spotted.

1214
01:50:32,300 --> 01:50:38,430
With me in L.A., it didn't take Lisa Wong
long to send an assassin of her own.

1215
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:41,230
- (Doorbell)
- [The Bride] Hello, can I help you?

1216
01:50:41,310 --> 01:50:44,650
[Woman] Hello, I'm Karen Kim.
I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.

1217
01:50:44,730 --> 01:50:46,530
I have a welcome gift
from the management.

1218
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:49,780
Oh, that's nice. Um...

1219
01:50:49,860 --> 01:50:51,860
Can you just leave it by the door?

1220
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:07,460
- You pretty good with that shotgun?
- Not that I have to be at this range,

1221
01:51:07,550 --> 01:51:09,460
but I'm a fucking surgeon
with this shotgun.

1222
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:12,550
Well, guess what, bitch?
I'm better than Annie Oakley.

1223
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:16,100
- And I got you right in my sight.
- I could blow your fucking head off.

1224
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:20,310
Not before I put one
right between your eyes, so let's talk.

1225
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:24,150
Karen...

1226
01:51:26,110 --> 01:51:28,440
...I just found out...

1227
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:30,490
...right now...

1228
01:51:30,530 --> 01:51:36,490
...not a moment before
you blew a hole through the door...

1229
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:39,450
...that I'm pregnant.
- What is this?

1230
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:43,790
On the floor by the door...

1231
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:46,960
...is a strip that says I'm pregnant.

1232
01:51:47,090 --> 01:51:48,210
Bullshit.

1233
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:53,180
Any other time
you'd be 100 percent right.

1234
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:56,140
This time...

1235
01:51:56,180 --> 01:51:58,220
...you're 100 percent wrong.

1236
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:04,270
I'm the deadliest woman in the world.

1237
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:06,560
But right now...

1238
01:52:06,650 --> 01:52:09,020
...I'm just scared shit-less for my baby.

1239
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:11,860
Please.

1240
01:52:12,990 --> 01:52:15,360
Just look at the strip.

1241
01:52:17,450 --> 01:52:19,160
Please.

1242
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:25,250
Stay where you are and don't move.

1243
01:52:42,430 --> 01:52:44,810
I don't know what this fucking shit means.

1244
01:52:44,890 --> 01:52:47,270
The box with the directions -
it's right there.

1245
01:52:59,070 --> 01:53:00,660
"Easy to use.

1246
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:05,330
Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end."

1247
01:53:05,410 --> 01:53:07,040
Blue means pregnant.

1248
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:09,840
I'll read it myself, thank you.

1249
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:19,680
Oh, OK.

1250
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:21,970
Say I were to believe you.
What then?

1251
01:53:22,010 --> 01:53:24,680
Just go home.

1252
01:53:25,810 --> 01:53:27,850
I'll do the same.

1253
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:34,940
(Door Opens)

1254
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:49,080
Congratulations.

1255
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:55,550
[The Bride] Before that strip turned blue...

1256
01:53:55,630 --> 01:53:59,090
...I was a woman, I was your woman.

1257
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:02,640
I was a killer who killed for you.

1258
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:05,810
Before that strip turned blue,
I would've jumped a motorcycle

1259
01:54:05,890 --> 01:54:08,890
onto a speeding train.

1260
01:54:08,980 --> 01:54:10,980
For you.

1261
01:54:12,270 --> 01:54:15,650
But once that strip turned blue...

1262
01:54:15,730 --> 01:54:19,240
...I could no longer do
any of those things.

1263
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:21,740
Not anymore.

1264
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:24,410
Because I was gonna be a mother.

1265
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,250
Can you understand that?

1266
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:35,090
Yes.

1267
01:54:35,170 --> 01:54:37,300
But why didn't you...

1268
01:54:37,420 --> 01:54:40,590
...tell me then, instead of now?

1269
01:54:40,630 --> 01:54:42,930
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

1270
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:45,010
And I didn't want that.

1271
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,970
Not your decision to make.

1272
01:54:48,060 --> 01:54:50,190
Yes.

1273
01:54:50,270 --> 01:54:54,520
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.

1274
01:54:54,610 --> 01:54:59,280
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.

1275
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:01,280
But with you...

1276
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:05,450
...she would've been born
into a world she shouldn't have.

1277
01:55:06,990 --> 01:55:10,160
I had to choose.

1278
01:55:10,290 --> 01:55:12,250
I chose her.

1279
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:17,630
You know, five years ago,

1280
01:55:17,710 --> 01:55:22,590
if I had to make a list of impossible
things that could never happen,

1281
01:55:22,630 --> 01:55:28,310
you performing a coup de grâce on me
by busting a cap in my crown...

1282
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:33,350
...would've been right
at the top of the list.

1283
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:37,070
I'd have been wrong, wouldn't I?

1284
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:40,320
I-I'm sorry.

1285
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,490
Was that a question?

1286
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:46,410
Of impossible things
that could never happen -

1287
01:55:46,490 --> 01:55:49,700
yes, in this instance,
you would've been wrong.

1288
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:51,660
Well?

1289
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:55,380
When you never came back,

1290
01:55:55,460 --> 01:56:01,550
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong,
or somebody else, had killed you.

1291
01:56:01,630 --> 01:56:04,840
Oh! And for the record...

1292
01:56:04,930 --> 01:56:09,100
...letting somebody think somebody
they love is dead when they're not

1293
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:11,180
is quite cruel.

1294
01:56:14,640 --> 01:56:18,520
I mourned you for three months.

1295
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:23,700
And in the third month of mourning you...

1296
01:56:23,740 --> 01:56:26,110
...I tracked you down.

1297
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:28,280
I wasn't trying to track you down.

1298
01:56:28,370 --> 01:56:33,830
I was trying to track down
the fucking assholes I thought killed you.

1299
01:56:33,870 --> 01:56:37,380
So I find you...

1300
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:39,630
...and what do I find?

1301
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:43,050
Not only are you not dead...

1302
01:56:43,130 --> 01:56:47,180
...you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.

1303
01:56:49,550 --> 01:56:52,020
And you're pregnant.

1304
01:56:55,390 --> 01:56:57,730
I overreacted.

1305
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:10,120
You overreacted?
Is that your explanation?

1306
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:12,620
I didn't say I was gonna explain myself.

1307
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:15,120
I said I was gonna tell you the truth.

1308
01:57:15,710 --> 01:57:19,670
But if that's too cryptic, let's get literal.

1309
01:57:22,130 --> 01:57:24,590
I'm a killer.

1310
01:57:24,710 --> 01:57:27,590
I'm a murdering bastard.
You know that.

1311
01:57:28,220 --> 01:57:31,180
And there are consequences...

1312
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:35,520
...to breaking the heart
of a murdering bastard.

1313
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:38,150
You experienced some of them.

1314
01:57:41,650 --> 01:57:45,240
Was my reaction really that surprising?

1315
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:49,030
Yes. It was.

1316
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:55,200
Could you do what you did?

1317
01:57:55,290 --> 01:57:59,040
Of course you could.

1318
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:05,460
But I never thought you would,
or could, do that to me.

1319
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:08,550
I'm really sorry, Kiddo...

1320
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:10,800
...but you thought wrong.

1321
01:58:17,060 --> 01:58:21,190
You and I have unfinished business.

1322

'Course he did.

1327

Why didn't you tell me?

1328
01:59:16,950 --> 01:59:19,000
I don't know.

1329
01:59:21,410 --> 01:59:24,330
Because I'm...

1330
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:27,500
...a bad person.

1331
01:59:27,590 --> 01:59:29,670
No.

1332
01:59:31,130 --> 01:59:34,180
You're not a bad person.

1333
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:37,260
You're a terrific person.

You're my favorite person.

1335

Do you have a magpie in your home?

02:02:31,650 --> 02:02:33,980
If you do, you are most fortunate.

1344
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:37,740
The magpie is the most
charming bird in all the world.

1345
02:02:37,820 --> 02:02:40,240
He is the best friend a farmer ever had.

1346
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:43,410
Treat him gently.
Treat him kindly.

1347
02:02:43,450 --> 02:02:47,910
And always remember,
the magpie deserves your respect.
