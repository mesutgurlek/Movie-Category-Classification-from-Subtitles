Little help...

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,495
Just... I have to keep
my hands on the wheel.

25
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:46,898
Excuse me!

26
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:52,369
- Dopinder.
- Pool. Dead.

27
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:57,029
- Nice!
- Smells good, no?

28
00:02:57,054 --> 00:02:59,331
Not the daffodil
daydream. The girl.

29
00:02:59,358 --> 00:03:02,701
Yes. Gita.
She is quite lovely.

30
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:05,249
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife.

31
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:06,946
But...

32
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,841
Gita's heart has been
stolen by my cousin, Bandu.

33
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,444
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.

34
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:17,326
Dopinder,

35
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:19,818
I'm starting to think there's a
reason I'm in this cab today.

36
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:21,430
Yes, sir, you called
for it, remember?

37
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:24,125
No, my slender, brown friend.
Love...

38
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:26,380
is a beautiful thing.

39
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:30,076
When you find it, the whole world
tastes like daffodil daydream.

40
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:34,155
So you gotta hold
on to love. Tight!

41
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:38,366
And never let go. Don't make the
same mistakes I did, got it?

42
00:03:38,476 --> 00:03:42,358
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.

43
00:03:42,383 --> 00:03:44,961
Sir, what does Miss
Mama June taste like?

44
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:47,876
Like two hobos fucking in
a shoe filled with piss.

45
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:50,658
I can go all day, Dopinder.
The point is it's bad.

46
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:55,501
Why the fancy
red suit, Mr. Pool?

47
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:57,696
Oh, that's because it's
Christmas day, Dopinder,

48
00:03:57,721 --> 00:04:00,202
and I'm after someone
on my naughty list.

49
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:03,899
I've been waiting, 1 year,
3 weeks, 6 days and...

50
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:07,166
14 minutes to make him
fix what he did to me.

51
00:04:07,191 --> 00:04:10,259
And what did he do
to you, Mr. Pool?

52
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,670
This shit.

53
00:04:13,298 --> 00:04:13,962
Boo!

54
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:38,264
- They won't disappoint.
- They'd better not!

55
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:42,086
- What about next month's shipment?
- There won't be one.

56
00:04:42,593 --> 00:04:45,158
You're not the only
one with a war to win.

57
00:04:45,397 --> 00:04:47,615
That won't do.

58
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:53,675
See, we've had this small
disruption to our supply trade.

59
00:04:57,347 --> 00:05:00,698
We'd appreciate your patience.

60
00:05:02,065 --> 00:05:03,675
Okay...

61
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,285
We'll deliver in full
the following month.

62
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:11,714
Pleasure doing
business with you.

63
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:16,518
Fucking mutant!

64
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:29,841
AHHHHHH Shit! I forgot my ammo bag!

65
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:33,966
- Shall we turn back?
- No time. Fuck it. I got this.

66
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:38,366
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets.
Or bust. Right here!

67
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:43,217
That's $27.50.

68
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:46,538
I never carry a wallet while I'm
working. Ruins the lines of my suit.

69
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:50,297
- But how 'bout a crisp high-five?
- Okay.

70
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:51,595

00:08:42,843 --> 00:08:44,835
Now, breaking news.

98
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,805
A multi-car collision turned shots fired
on the crosstown expressway this morning.

99
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,055
Gridlock has kept
police from the scene.

100
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,462
Residents are advised to
remain in their homes.

101
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:56,697
The assailant appears to be
armed, dangerous, and wearing a...

102
00:08:56,722 --> 00:09:00,003
Red suit. Deadpool.

103
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:03,026
Negasonic! Come.
We have mission.

104
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:05,996
Colossus, wait up.

105
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:09,606
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us.

106
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:14,266
But he'd rather act like
a child. A heavily armed child.

107
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:18,177
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?

108
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:20,200
Which benefits,
the matching unitards?

109
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:22,419
The house that blows
up every few years?

110
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:25,523
Please. House blowing
up builds character.

111
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:31,093
You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast
is most important meal of day.

112
00:09:31,147 --> 00:09:35,335
Here. Protein bar.
Good for bones.

113
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:38,396
Deadpool may try
to break yours.

114
00:10:05,532 --> 00:10:07,157
Hey!

115
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:21,788
Wait! You may be wondering
why the red suit.

116
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:24,609
Well that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.

117
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:28,268
This guy's got the right idea.
He wore the brown pants.

118
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:33,535
Fine! I only have 12 bullets, so
you're gonna have to share!

119
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,261
Let's count 'em down!

120
00:10:54,578 --> 00:11:00,969
Shit, motherfucker!

121
00:11:01,504 --> 00:11:03,270
Ten! Shit.

122
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,318
Nine! Fuck.
Eight. Shit-fuck!

123
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:12,578
Bad Deadpool.

124
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:15,561
Seven. Good Deadpool!

125
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:39,325
Someone's not counting.

126
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:40,809
Six!

127
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:08,470
Four...

128
00:12:11,025 --> 00:12:11,970
Gotcha!

129
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:15,466
Right up main street!

130
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,911
Three, two! Stupid!
Worth it.

131
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,806
I'm touching myself tonight.

132
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:54,362
Francis! Francis!

133
00:12:55,812 --> 00:13:00,110
What the shitbiscuit!
Where you at, Francis?

134
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:10,949
You're not Francis!

135
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,541
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?

136
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,579
You're probably thinking, "my boyfriend
said this was a superhero movie

137
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:38,275
but that guy in the red suit just turned
that other guy into a fucking kebab.

138
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,722
Well, I may be super.
But I'm no hero.

139
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:44,895
Anyhow, technically,
this is a murder.

140
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,334
But some of the best love
stories start with a murder.

141
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:51,593
And that's exactly what this is:
a love story. And to tell it right,

142
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,613
I gotta take you back to long before
I squeeze this ass into red spandex.

143
00:13:57,532 --> 00:14:02,883
Look, would it help if I slow it down
for you? I didn't order the pizza.

144
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,767
Is this 7348 Redledge Drive?

145
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:07,078
Are you Mr. Merchant?

146
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,613
The Mr. Merchant who didn't
order the fucking pie!

147
00:14:10,638 --> 00:14:13,140
- Who placed the call?
- I did!

148
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:20,577
Pineapple and olive?
Sweet and salty!

149
00:14:20,602 --> 00:14:23,594
The fuck are you? The fuck
are you doing in my crib?

150
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,306
- Is that bread crust? Don't move!
- God, I hope not.

151
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:31,183
Look, is this about that
poker game? I told Howie...

152
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:36,077
- Just take whatever you want.
- Thanks!

153
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:40,266
Sir, before you do anything to him,
do you mind if I get a big tip?

154
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,669
- Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson.
- Yeah.

155
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:48,320
That is a no go on
the tip-aroo, Jer.

156
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,103
I'm not here for him.
I'm here for you.

157
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:55,711
Hey wow I dodged a big-time
bullet on that one!

158
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:57,970
Not, out of the woods yet.

159
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:00,681
You need to seriously ease
up on the bedazzling.

160
00:15:00,706 --> 00:15:02,638
They're jeans, not a chandelier.

161
00:15:02,663 --> 00:15:05,062
Yes I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kind of give it to me.

162
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:09,593
- Just look, man, can I have my...
- I will shoot your fucking cat.

163
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,579
I don't really know what that
means, I don't have a cat.

164
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:15,305
Then whose kitty litter
did I just shit in?

165
00:15:18,422 --> 00:15:19,724
Anywho...

166
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:24,545
Tell me something. What situation
isn't improved by pizza?

167
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,999
Do you happen to know a Megan
Orflosky? Get that right? Orflovsky?

168
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:34,254
'Cause she knows you. Jeremy...

169
00:15:34,506 --> 00:15:37,908
I belong to a group of guys who
take a dime to beat a fella down.

170
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:42,538
And little Megan, she's not made of money,
but lucky for her, I got a soft spot.

171
00:15:42,888 --> 00:15:45,036
- I'm.....
- A stalker.

172
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:50,127
Threats hurt, Jer. Though not
nearly as badly as serrated steel.

173
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:55,758
- So keep away from Megan. Cool?
- Yes, sir.

174
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:59,337
- And we're done.
- Wait, we are?

175
00:15:59,362 --> 00:16:03,090
Totally done. You
should've seen your face!

176
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:04,966
I didn't know what to
do, I was so scared...

177
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:05,904
Soft spot, remember?

178
00:16:07,187 --> 00:16:11,030
Even look in her general direction again
and you will learn in the worst of ways

179
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:12,830
that I have some
hard spots, too.

180
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:16,584
That came out wrong.

181
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:19,455
Or did it?

182
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:33,357
Megan.

183
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:38,530
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.

184
00:16:38,674 --> 00:16:41,176
No friggin' way.

185
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:48,135
Should've brought my roller blades.
Show these kids how it's done.

186
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:51,497
And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.

187
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:53,670
Hey. Think you can
fuck up my step dad?

188
00:16:53,695 --> 00:16:56,499
If I can give the guy a pavement
facial, it's 'cause he's earned it.

189
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:58,289
Hey, wait.

190
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:03,779
- You're my hero.
- No, no, no, no, no. That, I ain't.

191
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:09,811
Nope. Never will be.
- Fuck you, Wade.

192
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:13,241
I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.

193
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:19,363
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.

194
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:21,617
Think of us as really
fucked up tooth fairies

195
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:24,016
except we knock out the
teeth and take the cash.

196
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:27,342
You'd best hope we never see
your name on a gold card.

197
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:29,593
(Buck! Liefeld.)

198
00:17:29,618 --> 00:17:32,422
- Hey, Wade!
- Wade Wilson. Patron Saint of the Pitiful.

199
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:35,439
- What can I do for you?
- I'd love a blowjob.

200
00:17:35,464 --> 00:17:39,668
- Oh, God, me too.
- The drink. With snuggle. But first...

201
00:17:40,331 --> 00:17:42,979
- Hey, I ain't taking
any babysitting money, alright

202
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:45,718
make sure that gets back to Miss...
- Orlovsky?

203
00:17:45,985 --> 00:17:47,680
- You sure?
- Hmm.

204
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:50,289
You know, for a merc, you're
pretty warm-blooded.

205
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:52,337
Bet you let the kid
off easy, too.

206
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,251
He's not a bad kid.

207
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:55,636
Just a little light stalking.

208
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:59,185
I was way worse when I was his age,
travelling to exotic places...

209
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,842
Baghdad, Mogadishu,
Jacksonville,

210
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,749
meeting new and exciting people.
And then..

211
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:05,941
Killing them. Yeah, I've
seen your instagram.

212
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:08,238
So what were special forces
doing in Jacksonville?

213
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:12,434
That's classified. They
have wonderful TGIFridays!

214
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:15,919
Alright, kahlua, baileys
and whipped cream.

215
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:18,279
I give you, a blowjob. I'm...

216
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:21,615
- Why do you make me make that?
- Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

217
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,554
Take that over there to Buck, please and
tell him it's from Booth. Little foreplay.

218
00:18:25,579 --> 00:18:27,774
Remind me what good
will come of this?

219
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:30,157
I don't take the shits,
I just disturb them.

220
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:33,552
What you want?

221
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:38,905
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.

222
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:42,599
That's a new stool.

223
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:49,073
Stay the fuck down.

224
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:55,200
Alright, move, move, move, move.

225
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:56,075
Buck, go rest.

226
00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:05,068
Yeup, He's still breathing.

227
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:11,043
Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade.

228
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:14,618
You got me. I picked Booth in
the dead pool. Who did you pick?

229
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:20,991
- You know, Wade, about that....
- No. You did not bet on me to die.

230
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:24,062
You bet on me to die.

231
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,383
Wow. Motherfucker, you're
the world's worst friend.

232
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:29,492
Well, joke's on you.
I'm living to 102.

233
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,765
And then die. At the
city of Detroit.

234
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,812
I'm sorry. I wanted
to win money.

235
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:36,172
I never win anything.

236
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:39,556
Whatever. Soldiers of
fortune, drink's on me!

237
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:41,551
Yeah!

238
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:43,803
Domestic! Nothing imported.

239
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:48,323
Woah, woah, woah. Baby...

240
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:50,349
Are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?

241
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:53,223
uhhhhh...

242
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:55,312
Tight.

243
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,280
- Vanessa.
- Wade.

244
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,324
What's a nice place like
you doing in a girl like this?

245
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,478
I'd hit that.

246
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:08,842
Buck, you'd best apologize
before... yeah. That.

247
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:11,632
- Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.
- I'm sorry.

248
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:12,485
Breathe through the nose.

249
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,283
I don't have a filter
between my brain and my...

250
00:20:15,308 --> 00:20:19,003
Okay, hey. Hakuna
his tatas, he's sorry!

251
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:21,302
Get outta here. Go cast a spell.

252
00:20:21,327 --> 00:20:23,956
Hey, hands off the merchandise.

253
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:29,022
Merchandise, huh. So you...

254
00:20:30,116 --> 00:20:31,951
- Fun fuzzies for money?
- Yup.

255
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:32,999
Rough childhood?

256
00:20:33,354 --> 00:20:36,133
Rougher than yours.
Daddy left before I was born.

257
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,002
Daddy left before I was conceived.

258
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:41,211
Ever had a cigarette
put out on your skin?

259
00:20:41,236 --> 00:20:42,521
Where else do you put one out?

260
00:20:42,546 --> 00:20:45,601
- I was molested.
- Me, too. Uncle.

261
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:47,846
Uncles. They took turns.

262
00:20:48,174 --> 00:20:50,220
I watched my own birthday
party through the keyhole

263
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:52,172
of a locked closet which
also happens to be my...

264
00:20:52,197 --> 00:20:55,859
Your bedroom. Lucky. I
slept in a dishwasher box.

265
00:20:55,884 --> 00:20:57,327
You had a dishwasher.

266
00:20:57,831 --> 00:20:58,910
I didn't even know sleep.

267
00:20:58,935 --> 00:21:02,380
It was pretty much 24/7 ball kegs,
brownie mix and clown porn.

268
00:21:05,937 --> 00:21:07,429
Who would do such a thing?

269
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:12,341
Hopefully, you.
Later tonight?

270
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:22,954
What can I get for 275 dollars
and a yogurt rewards card?

271
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:26,025
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.

272
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:29,453
And a low-fat dessert.

273
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,893
Did she just put a gift
card in your mouth?

274
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:42,135
It's time to put
balls in holes.

275
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,166
- You said whatever I want.
- I get it.

276
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,453
You love ski ball. Apparently
more than you love vagina.

277
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:52,179
That's a tough call.

278
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,079
I just wanna get to
know the real you.

279
00:21:55,104 --> 00:21:55,963
Not the short-

280
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:59,066
shorted 2-dimensional sex
object peddled by Hollywood.

281
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,511
Balls in holes.

282
00:22:01,377 --> 00:22:02,135
Balls in holes.

283
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:04,949
- Prepare to lose tragically.
- Bring it, big man.

284
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:05,668
- Okay!

285
00:22:12,348 --> 00:22:17,176
A limited edition Voltron: Defender
of the Universe ring, por favor.

286
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,652
Okay. Here you go.

287
00:22:20,487 --> 00:22:22,489
I had this sucker for a while.

288
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:25,721
- And I will take the pencil eraser.
- Okay.

289
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:29,182
You are now the proud
protector of the planet Arus.

290
00:22:29,207 --> 00:22:32,455
And you, can erase stuff.
Written in pencil.

291
00:22:32,596 --> 00:22:33,801
Milady.

292
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:37,419
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but your 48 minutes are up.

293
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:40,860
Hey, How many more minutes
could I get for this?

294
00:22:40,885 --> 00:22:45,464
FYI, 5 mini lion bots come
together to form 1 superbot.

295
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:48,853
5 mini lion bots? 3 minutes.

296
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:53,282
Deal. What do we do with
the remaining 2:37?

297
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:54,065
Cuddle?

298
00:22:58,288 --> 00:23:01,448
- How long can we keep this up?
- All year?

299
00:23:11,971 --> 00:23:14,372
Happy Valentines' Day.

300
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:24,206
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Year of the Dog.

301
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:34,057
Relax... and happy
International Women's Day.

302
00:23:43,403 --> 00:23:44,739
Happy Lenten.

303
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:49,862
OW
OW

304
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:54,053
- Wade!
- Sorry. Happy Halloween!

305
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:05,411
Happy Thanksgiving.

306
00:24:07,137 --> 00:24:08,833
I love you.

307
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,933
If your left leg is Thanksgiving,
and your right leg is Christmas...

308
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:19,003
Can I visit you
between the holidays?

309
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:22,644
OH!
That sweater is terrible!

310
00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:25,333
But red looks good on you.

311
00:24:25,358 --> 00:24:28,185
Red's your color. Mine's like
the bloodshot in your eyes.

312
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,289
- Listen. I've been thinking.
- Really?

313
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,232
- 'Bout why we're so good together.
- Why is that?

314
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:40,784
Well, your crazy matches
my crazy. Bigtime.

315
00:24:41,402 --> 00:24:45,405
And we're like 2 jigsaw
pieces. Weird curvy edges?

316
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,553
You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.

317
00:24:48,578 --> 00:24:49,658
Right.

318
00:24:50,213 --> 00:24:54,216
Wade... There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.

319
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:57,680
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.

320
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,972
Will you...
Um...

321
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:03,999
- Stick it up my...
- ...Marry me?

322
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:07,437
Uh... Jinx?

323
00:25:09,353 --> 00:25:11,355
- Where were you hiding that?
- Nowhere.

324
00:25:12,057 --> 00:25:15,359
- They said 1-month salary, so...
- You mean...

325
00:25:15,402 --> 00:25:17,804
- I do.
- That's my line.

326
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:25,191
- I love you, Wade Wilson.
- You're supposed to... So that's a...

327
00:25:25,216 --> 00:25:27,339
- Yes!
- Woo! Yes!

328
00:25:30,073 --> 00:25:32,074
I feel just like a little girl!

329
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,268
What if I just held
on and never let go?

330
00:25:39,293 --> 00:25:42,754
Just ride the bitch's
back like Yoda on Luke.

331
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,709
- Star Wars jokes!
- Empire!

332
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:50,860
Jesus Christ, it's like I
made you in a computer!

333
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:58,624
Perfect.

334
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:05,122
Pee break. Shake it, yeah.

335
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:12,840
Here's the thing:

336
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:15,060
Life is an endless
series of train wrecks

337
00:26:15,085 --> 00:26:17,638
with only brief commercial-like
breaks of happiness.

338
00:26:19,268 --> 00:26:22,885
This had been the
ultimate commercial break.

339
00:26:23,912 --> 00:26:27,915
Which meant it was time to return,
to our regularly scheduled programme.

340
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:31,511
- What the fu.....
- Oh my God, Wade!

341
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:42,082
You're clowning. You're
not clowning. I sense clowns.

342
00:26:42,107 --> 00:26:45,735
People react to news of late-
stage cancer differently.

343
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,119
There are certainly
options we can look into.

344
00:26:48,144 --> 00:26:50,454
New drugs are being
developed every day.

345
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:58,560
So what do we do? Surely,
there is something we can do.

346
00:26:59,795 --> 00:27:02,410
My Uncle Ivan was diagnosed
with Thyroid cancer

347
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:05,115
and there were all these
experimental drugs from Germany...

348
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,749
Vanessa's already working on plan
A, B, all the way through Z.

349
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:13,025
Me? I'm memorizing the
details of her face.

350
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,900
Like it's the first
time I'm seeing it.

351
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:20,184
- Or the last...
- Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson?

352
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,003
Take your time to process this.

353
00:27:24,197 --> 00:27:26,728
It's important not
to do anything rash.

354
00:27:37,536 --> 00:27:43,153
Now, if I were a 200 pound sack of assholes
named Francis, where would I hide?

355
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:12,400
"A hush falls over the crowd
as rookie sensation Wade W.

356
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:16,751
Wilson out of Regina,
Saskatchewan, lines up the shot."

357
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:19,446
"His form looks good."

358
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,012
"And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun."

359
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:31,200
"Ladies and gentlemen, what you're
witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge!"

360
00:28:31,225 --> 00:28:35,647
"Giving him the business! Incoming!"

361
00:28:36,043 --> 00:28:41,106
"This is taking unsportsman-like
conduct to a whole new level!"

362
00:28:44,874 --> 00:28:48,889
Looking good, Francis. Well-rested.
Like you've been pitching, not catching.

363
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:51,655
Ringing any bells? No?

364
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,072
How 'bout now?

365
00:29:01,336 --> 00:29:03,739
Wade fucking Wilson.

366
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,505
Well, hello, gorgeous.

367
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,600
Yeah, like I got bit by
a radioactive Shar Pei.

368
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:15,913
Yeah, and whose fault is that, huh, Francis?
Time to undo what you did to this butter face.

369
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:16,914
You should thank me.

370
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:20,810
Apparently, I've made you immortal.
I'm actually quite jealous.

371
00:29:20,835 --> 00:29:25,232
Yeah, but this ain't a
life worth living, is it? Now...

372
00:29:25,257 --> 00:29:30,261
I'm about to do to you what Limp
Bizkit did to music in the late 90's.

373
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:32,585
Dad?

374
00:29:35,921 --> 00:29:40,374
I think we can all agree that shit just
went sideways in the most colossal way.

375
00:29:41,436 --> 00:29:43,350
Well, maybe not the most.

376
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,703
Now this, is my
most prized possession.

377
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,539
- Wham?
- No, no, no, no. WHAM!

378
00:29:51,564 --> 00:29:54,807
Make It Big is the album that George and
Andy earned the exclamation point.

379
00:29:55,238 --> 00:29:59,142
So, am I supposed to just
smile and wave you out the door?

380
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:02,071
Think of it like spring cleaning.
Only if spring was death.

381
00:30:02,096 --> 00:30:06,712
God, if I had a nickel for everytime I
spanked at the Bernadette Peters.

382
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:11,033
Sounds like you do.
Bernadette is not going...

383
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:13,346
anywhere, because you're
not going anywhere.

384
00:30:13,836 --> 00:30:15,137
- Drink.
- You're right.

385
00:30:15,162 --> 00:30:18,664
Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate
and brain. All things I can live without.

386
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,567
You belong here at home.

387
00:30:22,592 --> 00:30:26,847
Surrounded by your Voltron, and
your Bernadette and your me.

388
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:31,876
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit show.

389
00:30:31,924 --> 00:30:34,524
Like a Yakov Smirnoff,

390
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:39,394
opening for the spin doctors at
the Iowa state fair shit show.

391
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:45,333
And under no circumstances
will I take you, to that show.

392
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:50,914
I want you to remember me.
Not the "ghost of Christmas" me.

393
00:30:51,328 --> 00:30:52,927
I wanna remember us!

394
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,172
I swear to God,

395
00:30:54,196 --> 00:30:58,196
I'll find you in the next life and boom
box Careless Whisper outside your window.

396
00:30:58,221 --> 00:30:59,244
WHAM!

397
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:06,257
No one is boom
boxing shit. Okay?

398
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,776
We can fight this.

399
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:15,457
Besides...
I just realized something...

400
00:31:16,158 --> 00:31:16,908
You win.

401
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:20,626
Your life is officially way more fucked up than mine.

402
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:27,492
I love you

403
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:39,888
Wade.

404
00:31:41,836 --> 00:31:43,037
Wease.

405
00:31:43,046 --> 00:31:45,500
You look like you need a
blowjob and a shower.

406
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:47,914
Little courtesy calls
for the latter, first.

407
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,462
How about three shots of patron.

408
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:52,627
Or, how about,
Triticum aestivum?

409
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:54,714
Wheatgrass. Excellent
for the immune system.

410
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:56,676
Jesus Christ, you
sound like Vanessa.

411
00:31:56,701 --> 00:31:57,880
Here, check it out.

412
00:31:57,905 --> 00:32:01,022
She's sending away for all these
colorful clinic brochures.

413
00:32:01,647 --> 00:32:03,741
I'm sure they're
all FDA approved.

414
00:32:03,766 --> 00:32:06,934
Chechnya? Isn't that where
you go to get cancer?

415
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,748
We got China and Central Mexico.

416
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:12,252
You know how they say
cancer in Spanish?

417
00:32:12,277 --> 00:32:13,432
No.

418
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:17,024
- "El cancer."
- I could've guessed that.

419
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:19,280
Look how happy you look here.

420
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:22,182
You mind if I keep this, put
it up, so I can remember?

421
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,846
When you looked alive.

422
00:32:23,871 --> 00:32:25,668
At least now I'm gonna
win the dead pool.

423
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,693
Now that you'll die,
tragically, of cancer.

424
00:32:28,718 --> 00:32:30,577
I got it, thanks.

425
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:37,238
That guy over there came in looking
for you. Real grim reaper type.

426
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:40,834
I don't know. Might
further the plot.

427
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,932
- Booth.
- Wade.

428
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,392
Mr. Wilson.

429
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:55,564
How can I help you, besides

430
00:32:55,589 --> 00:32:57,580
luring children into a panel van?

431
00:32:57,605 --> 00:33:01,331
I understand you've recently been
diagnosed with terminal cancer.

432
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:02,454
Stalker alert!

433
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:04,893
It's my job. Recruitment.

434
00:33:05,455 --> 00:33:08,979
I'm sorry you've had
such a tough go.

435
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,219
But you're a fighter.

436
00:33:10,244 --> 00:33:14,101
Special Forces. 41 confirmed kills.

437
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:18,141
1 every 7 weeks. Same rate
most folks get a haircut.

438
00:33:18,727 --> 00:33:19,937
This should wash the taste down.

439
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:23,469
It's tough to forget
being so impressive.

440
00:33:23,494 --> 00:33:27,642
And now you spend your days
sticking up for the little people.

441
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:29,515
People change. What do you want?

442
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,727
I represent an organization
that may be able to help.

443
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:38,211
What if I told you we
can cure your cancer?

444
00:33:38,844 --> 00:33:43,554
And what's more, give you
abilities most men only dream of.

445
00:33:46,553 --> 00:33:48,747
I'd say that you sound like
an infomercial. But...

446
00:33:48,772 --> 00:33:52,441
Not a good one, like
Slapchop, more Shakeweighty.

447
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:57,403
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.
We won't just make you better.

448
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,392
We will make you
better than better.

449
00:34:01,736 --> 00:34:03,013
A superhero.

450
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:06,399
Look, Agent Smith,

451
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:08,696
I tried the hero business
and it left a mark.

452
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:10,760
But if I ever hit fuck-
it, I'll look you up.

453
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:14,195
Oh. Shit.

454
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,477
We're within 500 yards of the school.
So you may wanna, you know...

455
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:23,342
His drink's on him.

456
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:29,878
What'd he say?

457
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,496
Hey, what's going on?

458
00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:00,093
Hey, sorry. I had a
Liam Neeson nightmare.

459
00:35:01,275 --> 00:35:04,399
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter
and he just wasn't having it.

460
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:16,363
They made 3 of those movies.

461
00:35:17,418 --> 00:35:20,421
At some point, you'd have to
wonder if he's just a bad parent.

462
00:35:34,975 --> 00:35:38,277
The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you.

463
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:40,944
But what it does to
the people you love.

464
00:35:42,195 --> 00:35:44,733
Who knew if this guy
could save my life?

465
00:35:44,797 --> 00:35:48,262
But I knew there's only one
way that I could save hers.

466
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:53,929
Isn't that what superheroes do?

467
00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:10,205
Okay. Let's pro/con
this superhero thing.

468
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:15,245
Pro: they pull down
a gaggle of ass,

469
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,465
local dry cleaning discounts,
lucrative film deals,

470
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,471
both origin stories and larger,
ensemble team movies.

471
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:23,511
Con: they're all lame-
ass teacher's pets!

472
00:36:23,536 --> 00:36:25,621
You know I can hear you.

473
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:28,622
Wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to them.

474
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:30,389
Stay right here.

475
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:33,519
You've been warned
before, Deadpool.

476
00:36:33,544 --> 00:36:37,083
This is a shameful and
reckless use of your powers.

477
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:39,303
You will both be coming with us.

478
00:36:39,328 --> 00:36:43,343
Look Colossus, I don't have time for the
goody two-tissues bullshit right now.

479
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,296
And you are?

480
00:36:46,765 --> 00:36:48,562
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.

481
00:36:48,587 --> 00:36:51,751
Negasonic Teenage...
What the shit?!

482
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:53,899
That's the coolest name ever!

483
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:59,576
- So what, you're like his sidekick?
- No. Trainee.

484
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:03,671
Let me guess, X-Men left you
behind on what, shit detail?

485
00:37:03,696 --> 00:37:04,969
What does that make you?

486
00:37:04,994 --> 00:37:08,548
Pretending you're not here, Negasonic
Teenage Warhead. Can we trade names?

487
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:12,501
- Can we go?
- "Look! I'm a teenage girl!"

488
00:37:12,526 --> 00:37:14,751
"I'd rather be anywhere than here.

489
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:18,845
I'm all about long, sullen silences,
followed by mean comments,

490
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,753
followed by more silences."

491
00:37:20,777 --> 00:37:22,703
So what's it gonna be? huh?

492
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:26,346
Long, sullen silence?
Or mean comment? Go on.

493
00:37:28,269 --> 00:37:29,495
You got me in a box here.

494
00:37:30,593 --> 00:37:34,234
We can't allow this, Deadpool.
Please, come quietly.

495
00:37:34,259 --> 00:37:37,344
- You big, chrome cockgobbler!
- That's not nice.

496
00:37:37,369 --> 00:37:40,415
You really got to fuck
this up for me? Trust me...

497
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:46,290
That wheezing bag of dick-tits
has it coming! He's pure evil!

498
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:51,180
Besides, nobody's getting hurt.

499
00:37:55,236 --> 00:37:57,354
That guy was already
up there when I got here.

500
00:37:57,379 --> 00:38:00,761
Wade, you are better than this.

501
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:03,762
Join us, use your
powers for good.

502
00:38:03,787 --> 00:38:05,802
- Heads up!
- Be a superhero.

503
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:09,561
- Listen! The day I decide to be
a crime-fighting shit-swizzler,

504
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:11,586
who rooms with a bunch
of other little whiners,

505
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:13,759
at the Neverland Mansion
of some creepy,

506
00:38:13,784 --> 00:38:17,448
old, bald, heaven's gate
looking motherfucker,

507
00:38:17,473 --> 00:38:19,026
on that day!,

508
00:38:19,604 --> 00:38:21,697
I'll send your shiny, happy
ass a friend request.

509
00:38:21,722 --> 00:38:24,166
But until then, I'm gonna
do what I came here to do.

510
00:38:24,191 --> 00:38:26,948
Either that, or slap
the bitch out of you!

511
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:28,519
- Wade...
- Hey.

512
00:38:28,544 --> 00:38:30,606
- Zip it, Sinead!
- Hey, Douchepool!

513
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:32,248
And I hope you're watching...

514
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,400
Quite unfortunate.

515
00:38:41,668 --> 00:38:44,113
That does it!

516
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,519
Canada!

517
00:38:51,043 --> 00:38:54,238
- That's not good. Cock shot!
- Wade, please.

518
00:38:56,046 --> 00:38:58,123
Oh, your poor wife!

519
00:38:58,148 --> 00:39:00,976
You really should stop.

520
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:05,680
All the dinosaurs
feared the T-Rex.

521
00:39:09,893 --> 00:39:12,446
I promise this gets
worse for you, big boy!

522
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:14,627
This is embarassing.

523
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,931
Please. Stay down.

524
00:39:17,517 --> 00:39:19,985
Did you ever hear of the one-legged
man in the ass-kicking contest?

525
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,541
Do you have 'off' switch?

526
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:24,441
Yeah, it's right next to the prostate.
Or is that the 'on' switch?

527
00:39:24,466 --> 00:39:27,145
Enough!

528
00:39:34,952 --> 00:39:37,257
Let us go talk to the Professor.

529
00:39:37,282 --> 00:39:41,617
McAvoy or Stewart? These
timelines are so confusing...

530
00:39:42,751 --> 00:39:48,782
- Dead or alive, you're coming with me!
- You will recover, Wade. You always do.

531
00:39:53,428 --> 00:39:56,569
Did you ever see "127 Hours"?
Spoiler alert!

532
00:40:01,042 --> 00:40:03,237
Oh my God. Nasty.

533
00:40:05,476 --> 00:40:11,108
Oh, there's the money shot, baby. Are
you there, God? It's me, Margaret.

534
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:23,871
Rock, meet bottom.

535
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:27,597
When life ends up
breathtakingly fucked,

536
00:40:27,622 --> 00:40:31,725
you can generally trace it
back to one big, bad decision.

537
00:40:31,767 --> 00:40:34,671
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburg.

538
00:40:34,786 --> 00:40:37,689
This, well, this was mine.

539
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:45,715
Mr. Wilson. Nothing warms my heart
more than a change of someone else's.

540
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,742
You've finally hit fuck-it.

541
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:51,326
Just promise you'll do right by me.

542
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:53,763
So I can do right by someone else.

543
00:40:53,788 --> 00:40:54,987
Of course.

544
00:40:55,773 --> 00:41:00,777
And please don't make the
super-suit green. Or animated!

545
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:25,343
This place seems sanitary.
My first request is warmer hands.

546
00:41:26,208 --> 00:41:29,263
And Jesus! A warmer table.

547
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,104
You should really come up
with a safe word, fellas.

548
00:41:33,129 --> 00:41:34,996
I'm thinking 'pork and beans'.

549
00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:40,592
Easy!

550
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,343
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?

551
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,298
I'm calling Wang.

552
00:41:50,904 --> 00:41:55,271
What's up with the matches?
Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?

553
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,826
Patience, Angel.
All in good time.

554
00:41:59,981 --> 00:42:03,568
Are you here for the turn
down service or what?

555
00:42:04,134 --> 00:42:05,188
We have another talker.

556
00:42:05,335 --> 00:42:07,506
I'm just excited about my
first day at superhero camp.

557
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:09,250
Shut the fuck up.

558
00:42:12,694 --> 00:42:17,698
Mr. Wilson, my name's
Ajax. I manage this workshop.

559
00:42:18,863 --> 00:42:22,228
All of my welcome speeches used
to be filled with euphemisms like,

560
00:42:22,253 --> 00:42:25,869
"this may hurt a little," or
"this might cause you some discomfort."

561
00:42:26,056 --> 00:42:27,498
But I'm going blunt.

562
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:30,958
This workshop is not a
government-led program.

563
00:42:30,959 --> 00:42:33,812
It's a private institution that
turns reclamation projects

564
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:35,271
like yourself into men of....

565
00:42:35,963 --> 00:42:38,965
Extraordinary abilities.

566
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:43,413
But if you think superhuman
powers are acquired painlessly...

567
00:42:43,626 --> 00:42:44,727
Wrong.

568
00:42:45,282 --> 00:42:46,782
I'm injecting you with a serum

569
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:49,509
that activates any mutant
genes lurking in your DNA.

570
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:54,638
For it to work, we need to
subject you to extreme stress.

571
00:42:58,887 --> 00:43:02,890
You've heard the whole, "make an
omelet, break some eggs" bit, right?

572
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:08,001
I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was
a patient here once myself, you know.

573
00:43:08,723 --> 00:43:13,816
The treatment affects everyone differently.
It made Angel inhumanly strong.

574
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:18,795
In my case, it
enhanced my reflexes,

575
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:22,109
also scorched my nerve endings
so I no longer feel pain.

576
00:43:23,936 --> 00:43:27,984
And in fact, I no
longer feel anything.

577
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:41,235
Thank... thank you! You
have something in your teeth.

578
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:47,264
Right in the middle there, just...
Nugget of romaine lettuce or something.

579
00:43:49,105 --> 00:43:51,106
It's been bothering
me for a long time.

580
00:43:53,074 --> 00:43:56,108
Made you look. Hey, is
Ajax your actual name,

581
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,250
because it sounds
suspiciously made up.

582
00:43:58,275 --> 00:44:05,548
What is it really? Kevin? Bruce? Scott?
Mitch? Rickster? Is it Basil Fawlty?

583
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:10,869
Joke away. One thing that never survives
this place is a sense of humor.

584
00:44:10,894 --> 00:44:13,897
- We'll see about that.
- I suppose we will.

585
00:44:14,884 --> 00:44:16,159
He's all yours.

586
00:44:16,184 --> 00:44:21,907
C'mon. You're gonna leave me all alone
here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?

587
00:44:25,846 --> 00:44:27,902
This is how it's going to work.

588
00:44:27,927 --> 00:44:31,248
Adrenaline acts as a
catalyst for the serum, so

589
00:44:31,495 --> 00:44:34,056
we're gonna have to
make you suffer.

590
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,588
If you're lucky, your mutant genes
will activate and manifest in a

591
00:44:38,613 --> 00:44:40,607
spectacular fashion.

592
00:44:44,938 --> 00:44:48,087
If not, well, we'll have
to keep on hurting you.

593
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:52,923
In new and different ways,
each more painful than the last.

594
00:44:55,088 --> 00:44:58,091
Until you finally mutate...

595
00:44:58,981 --> 00:45:00,681
or die.

596
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:08,905
You mean like a bucket list?

597
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:14,242
Like a fuck it list, I'd like to
light a spiff off the Olympic torch.

598
00:45:14,352 --> 00:45:16,406
Acid to me, right after.

599
00:45:16,431 --> 00:45:22,360
Let's not forget: naked tandem base-jumping
with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.

600
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:25,923
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.

601
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:29,346
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter Birney a dutch oven.

602
00:45:29,371 --> 00:45:34,760
No, receiving a dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter Birney.

603
00:45:37,097 --> 00:45:41,487
Making banana
pancakes... For my kids...

604
00:45:44,455 --> 00:45:46,253
Vanessa...

605
00:45:50,036 --> 00:45:52,598
I wanna see Vanessa.

606
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:57,090
Oh, lovely. I don't know about
anyone else but, I'm touched.

607
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,331
We're just joking.

608
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:03,864
No, no. It's okay. I
encourage distractions.

609
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,590
Wouldn't want you giving
up on us now, would we?

610
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:11,421
Hey, don't take any shit from him,
Cunningham. How tough can he be...

611
00:46:12,012 --> 00:46:16,785
- ... with a name like Francis?
- Francis?

612
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:22,145
It's his legal name. He
got Ajax from a dish soap.

613
00:46:24,524 --> 00:46:30,462
F-R-A-N-C-I... oops!

614
00:46:31,761 --> 00:46:34,862
Snagged the dry cleaning
tag off your lab coat.

615
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:39,035
FYI, I can probably get
you a superhero discount.

616
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:42,871
- You are so relentlessly annoying.
- Thanks. Never heard that before.

617
00:46:42,896 --> 00:46:45,839
Why don't you do us all a
favor and shut the fuck up?

618
00:46:46,192 --> 00:46:48,398
Or I'll sew your
pretty mouth shut.

619
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:51,828
Oh, I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

620
00:46:51,853 --> 00:46:54,712
See, here's the problem with
round-the-clock torture,

621
00:46:54,737 --> 00:46:58,177
is that you can't really
step it up from there.

622
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,486
Is that what you think?

623
00:47:08,379 --> 00:47:12,997
If this doesn't unlock your
mutation, then, well, nothing will.

624
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,511
What we're gonna do is lower the
oxygen concentration in the air

625
00:47:16,536 --> 00:47:19,332
to the exact point you feel
like you're suffocating.

626
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:23,168
If your brain wave's slow meaning
you're about to pass out,

627
00:47:23,193 --> 00:47:25,051
then we'll turn up the O2.

628
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:28,645
If your heart rate slows meaning
you're able to catch your breath,

629
00:47:28,977 --> 00:47:30,311
we'll turn it back down.

630
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:35,384
And that's where we'll
leave you. Right there.

631
00:47:35,557 --> 00:47:39,670
- I thought you guys were dicks before...
- You know the funniest part of this?

632
00:47:41,077 --> 00:47:44,079
You still think we're
making you a superhero.

633
00:47:44,179 --> 00:47:50,883
You? A dishonorable discharge?
Hip deep in hookers?

634
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:56,044
You're nothing. A little secret, Wade...

635
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:59,971
This workshop doesn't make
superheroes, we make superslaves.

636
00:48:01,217 --> 00:48:05,787
We're gonna fit you with a control collar
and auction you off to the highest bidder.

637
00:48:05,812 --> 00:48:07,921
And that's what they'll
have you doing.

638
00:48:08,008 --> 00:48:11,155
Terrorizing citizens, putting
down freedom fighters.

639
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,891
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.

640
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:19,117
What the fuck is wrong with you?

641
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:29,867
You're never going home after
this. Now there's a brave face.

642
00:48:30,169 --> 00:48:33,171
Wait, wait, wait...

643
00:48:34,493 --> 00:48:39,247
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.

644
00:48:40,594 --> 00:48:45,378
- Enjoy your weekend.
- Weekend? Back up, weekend?

645
00:49:26,916 --> 00:49:32,026
Did I say this was a love
story? No. It's a horror movie.

646
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:52,972
Fucking hell! Looks like someone
lost a shot at homecoming king.

647
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:55,497
What have you done to me?

648
00:49:55,522 --> 00:49:59,162
I've mainly raised your stress levels
high enough to trigger a mutation.

649
00:49:59,187 --> 00:50:03,554
- You sadistic fuck!
- I've cured you, Wade.

650
00:50:03,579 --> 00:50:06,429
Now your mutated cells
can heal anything.

651
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:09,944
Striking your cancer as
fast as it can form.

652
00:50:11,037 --> 00:50:16,575
Yeah, I've seen some other side
effects before... I could cure them.

653
00:50:19,426 --> 00:50:21,427
But where's the fun in that?

654
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:26,634
Now I'm gonna shut
you in again, Wade.

655
00:50:27,993 --> 00:50:30,180
Not because I need to.

656
00:50:34,015 --> 00:50:35,813
Because I want to.

657
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:53,116
Farewell. Go ahead.

658
00:50:55,571 --> 00:50:58,212
Ohh. You smell like shit.

659
00:51:00,786 --> 00:51:04,790
- Motherfucker...
- That's alright, it's alright...

660
00:51:05,352 --> 00:51:12,256
I think we owe him that one, yea?
You take off. Go on, off you go.

661
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:25,298
Quick question:

662
00:51:27,128 --> 00:51:29,129
What's my name?

663
00:51:34,522 --> 00:51:36,397
Didn't think so.

664
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:41,231
Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.

665
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:41,412
You don't wanna kill me. I'm the
only one who can fix your ugly mug!

666
00:54:37,705 --> 00:54:39,189
What's my name?

667
00:54:45,445 --> 00:54:47,289
Wade...

668
00:55:53,834 --> 00:56:01,840
I didn't just get the cure to el cancer...
I got the cure to el everything.

669
00:56:04,773 --> 00:56:09,776
But there was only one
thing that really mattered.

670
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:34,404
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.

671
00:57:34,429 --> 00:57:39,935
- Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.
- Bullshit! I'm a monster inside now.

672
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,155
- I belong in a fucking circus.
- Wade, Vanessa loves you.

673
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:47,161
- She doesn't care what you... Oh!
- Do you like what you see?

674
00:57:47,186 --> 00:57:53,521
No. You look like an avocado had sex
with an older, more disgusting avocado.

675
00:57:53,546 --> 00:57:56,192
Not gently. He was hate-fucking.

676
00:57:56,217 --> 00:57:58,271
There was something wrong
with the relationship

677
00:57:58,296 --> 00:58:01,942
and that was their only
catharsis without violence.

678
00:58:01,967 --> 00:58:05,732
And the only guy who can fix this
fugly mug is the British shitstick

679
00:58:05,757 --> 00:58:08,913
who ran the mutant factory.
And he's gone... Poof!

680
00:58:08,938 --> 00:58:10,859
You gotta do something
to remedy this.

681
00:58:10,884 --> 00:58:13,723
'Cause as of now, you only
have one course of action:

682
00:58:13,748 --> 00:58:17,298
- Damn straight. Find Francis.
- Star in horror films.

683
00:58:17,297 --> 00:58:20,437
- What?
- Star in your own horror films.

684
00:58:20,462 --> 00:58:24,227
'Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face-
fucked a topographical map of Utah.

685
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,480
Here's what I'm
actually gonna do:

686
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,542
I'm gonna work thru his crew
until somebody gives up Francis,

687
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:33,723
force him to fix this, put a bullet
in his skull, and fuck the brainhole.

688
00:58:33,748 --> 00:58:37,004
I don't wanna see that,
or think of it again. But,

689
00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:39,199
the douchebag does think
you're dead, right?

690
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:39,833
Yeah.

691
00:58:39,858 --> 00:58:41,850
That's good. You should
keep it that way.

692
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:43,546
What, like, wear a mask?

693
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:51,012
Yes, a very thick mask. All the
time. I'm sorry, you're haunting.

694
00:58:51,043 --> 00:58:54,207
- Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
- Like a testicle with teeth.

695
00:58:54,232 --> 00:59:00,482
You will die alone. I mean if you
could die. Ideally. For others' sake.

696
00:59:00,507 --> 00:59:01,474
That'll do.

697
00:59:01,947 --> 00:59:06,060
What you need now is a suit and a
nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker...

698
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:11,170
or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie.
Oh, shit.

699
00:59:11,509 --> 00:59:12,889
What?

700
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:17,380
I put all my money on you, and now I just
realized I'm never gonna win the....

701
00:59:17,405 --> 00:59:18,506

702
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:25,092
Captain Deadpool.

703
00:59:26,137 --> 00:59:29,103
No. Just-just Deadpool. Yeah.

704
00:59:29,128 --> 00:59:31,259
To you, Mr. Pool.

705
00:59:31,284 --> 00:59:35,378

like a fuckin' franchise.

have nuts in it!

They call me Deadpool, I'm hella fast

711
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:53,150
Where's Francis?

712
00:59:53,175 --> 00:59:55,560
Came to merc the bad guys, and get some ass

713
00:59:55,585 --> 00:59:57,415
Got blades for days, got guns galore

714
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,298
Got combo moves, evades and more

715
01:00:07,092 --> 01:00:08,693
Where is Francis?

716
01:00:08,718 --> 01:00:10,271
Run away, you know that I'll chase

717
01:00:10,296 --> 01:00:12,021
Every bad guy, put them
right in their place

718
01:00:12,046 --> 01:00:13,975
Revenge, im gonna give you a taste

719
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,194
I'm sexy as hell, but I cover my face

720
01:00:16,806 --> 01:00:23,423
Seltzer water and lemon for
blood. Or wear red. Dumbass!

01:00:24,566 --> 01:00:28,762
Captain Deadpool (Nah, just Deadpool)

722
01:00:28,787 --> 01:00:30,841
Merc with a mouth, I can't die

723
01:00:30,866 --> 01:00:32,866
One foot in the grave
But I'm still alive

724
01:00:32,891 --> 01:00:34,743
Try to kill me, I'll just revive

725
01:00:34,768 --> 01:00:37,290
Then I'll put another bullet
right between your eyes

726
01:00:41,794 --> 01:00:43,513
Don't make me ask twice.

727
01:00:44,765 --> 01:00:47,767
Where is Francis?

728
01:00:48,955 --> 01:00:52,345
He made me ask twice.
Is the mask muffling my voice?

729
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,556
I'm bout to take you all
to school with guns and knives

Where's fucking Francis?

733
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:15,422
You're about to be
killed by a Zamboni!

734
01:01:15,447 --> 01:01:16,968
Where's Francis?

735
01:01:17,969 --> 01:01:22,842

- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

Francis?

739
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,311
This is confusing!

740
01:01:35,336 --> 01:01:40,656
Is it sexist to hit you, is it more sexist
to not hit you, the line gets real blurry!

741
01:01:40,839 --> 01:01:42,740
Donde esta Francesca?

01:03:59,365 --> 01:04:00,052
Whew!

766
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:03,514
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed.

767
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:07,208
Like the kind where your year-long
plan ends with the wrong guy

768
01:04:07,233 --> 01:04:08,542
getting dismembered!

769
01:04:09,315 --> 01:04:14,218
That said, when it comes time to licking
wounds, there's no place like home.

770
01:04:14,445 --> 01:04:16,561
I share that home with someone you've met.

771
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:19,031
The old blind lady from the laundrymat, Al.

772
01:04:19,336 --> 01:04:21,609
- GOD I MISS COCAINE...

773
01:04:21,633 --> 01:04:22,226
- her...

774
01:04:23,328 --> 01:04:26,047
Fourth wall break inside a fourth wall break

775
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:29,296
Thats like....
sixteen walls....

776
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:33,545
She's like Robin to my Batman.
Except she is old... and black.

777
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:34,724
And blind...

778
01:04:34,749 --> 01:04:36,445
And I think she is in love with me.

779
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:41,405
Wait...
I am pretty sure Robin loves Batman too...

780
01:04:49,832 --> 01:04:52,075
Al?

781
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:55,210
Morning, sleepyhead.

782
01:04:56,758 --> 01:05:00,687
- It smells like old lady pants in here.
- Yes I'm old, I wear pants.

783
01:05:00,732 --> 01:05:04,429
But you're no lady.
Oh, so comfy.

784
01:05:05,867 --> 01:05:08,925
Upside of being blind, I've
never seen you in crocs.

785
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:10,668
You mean my big, rubber,
masturbating shoes?

786
01:05:10,685 --> 01:05:16,661
Yes I know. Downside of being blind,
I hear everything in this duplex.

787
01:05:19,168 --> 01:05:21,465
- Sit on a stick.
- Bactine?

788
01:05:21,489 --> 01:05:22,629
Yeah.

789
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:25,312
Bactine should do it.

790
01:05:26,785 --> 01:05:30,770
How's the Kullen coming along?
 Ikea doesn't assemble itself, you know.

791
01:05:30,795 --> 01:05:35,810
You're telling me. I don't mind the Kullen.
It's an improvement on the Hurdal.

792
01:05:35,835 --> 01:05:38,874
Please..
Anything's an improvement over the Hurdal.

793
01:05:38,899 --> 01:05:42,609
I'd have taken a Hemnes
or a Trysil over a Hurdal.

794
01:05:42,944 --> 01:05:45,914
[sighs]
No, I didn't get excited until I saw the Kullen.

795
01:05:46,148 --> 01:05:47,047
Screw, please.

796
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:49,712
Here? Now? Just kidding. I
know it's been decades.

797
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:52,908
- You'd be surprised.
- Pretty grossed out.

798
01:05:54,702 --> 01:05:57,596
Ta... dah...

799
01:06:02,842 --> 01:06:06,048
I wish I never heard, of Craigslist.

800
01:06:06,516 --> 01:06:09,359
And I quote, "Looking for roommate,
blind, and likes imperfections.

801
01:06:09,384 --> 01:06:12,555
Must be good with hands." Or would you
rather I build the Ikea and you pay rent?

802
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,189
- Why such a douche this morning?

803
01:06:15,214 --> 01:06:20,675
Let's recap: the cock-thistle that turned me into
this freak slipped through my arms today..

804
01:06:22,064 --> 01:06:23,018
Arm...

805
01:06:23,752 --> 01:06:27,072
Catching him was my only chance to be
hot again, get my super-sexy ex back

806
01:06:27,097 --> 01:06:29,198
and prevent this from
happening to someone else.

807
01:06:29,223 --> 01:06:32,815
So yeah, today was about as
much fun as a sandpaper dildo.

808
01:06:34,154 --> 01:06:34,926
[farts]

809
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:37,122
#drive-by.

810
01:06:53,355 --> 01:06:56,371
Found out who our
friend in the red suit is.

811
01:06:57,738 --> 01:07:04,027
Fucking Wade Wilson. Suppose I'd wear
a mask, too, if I had a face like that.

812
01:07:04,163 --> 01:07:06,066
I only wish I'd heal the same.

813
01:07:09,549 --> 01:07:13,845
Still, we'll put him out of
our misery. On our terms.

814
01:07:14,135 --> 01:07:15,924
Right. And when he heals?

815
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,432
He can't. Not if there's
nothing left of him to heal.

816
01:07:20,713 --> 01:07:24,931
You know, it's funny. I
almost missed the fucker.

817
01:07:26,003 --> 01:07:33,253
I like a challenge. But he's bad
for business. Now let's go find him.

818
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:35,683
[groans]

819
01:07:37,301 --> 01:07:38,839
Tylenol PM?

820
01:07:38,905 --> 01:07:41,636
It sticks back where
you stuck the Bactine.

821
01:07:41,661 --> 01:07:44,106
I raided my stash of
wisdom tooth percocet

822
01:07:44,131 --> 01:07:47,927
and I am orbiting fucking
Saturn right now.

823
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:52,944
But I appreciate the gesture.

824
01:07:53,901 --> 01:07:58,360
Am I crazy? Or is
your hand really small?

825
01:07:58,385 --> 01:08:00,369
About the size of a KFC spork.

826
01:08:02,272 --> 01:08:03,783
I get why you're so pissy,

827
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:06,279
but your mood's never
gonna brighten

828
01:08:06,304 --> 01:08:08,967
'till you find this woman
and tell her how you feel.

829
01:08:08,992 --> 01:08:10,656
What do I keep telling
you, Mrs. McGoo?

830
01:08:10,681 --> 01:08:14,163
She wouldn't have me. If you
could see me, you'd understand.

831
01:08:14,188 --> 01:08:15,211
Looks aren't everything.

832
01:08:15,236 --> 01:08:18,337
Looks are everything! Ever
heard David Beckham speak?

833
01:08:18,696 --> 01:08:20,782
It's like he mouth-sexed
a can of helium.

834
01:08:21,134 --> 01:08:24,196
You think Ryan Reynolds got this
far on a superior acting method?

835
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:26,524
- Love is blind, Wade.
- No...

836
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:29,559
You're blind.

837
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:32,725
So you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?

838
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,937
No, I'm gonna wait 'till this
arm plows through puberty

839
01:08:34,962 --> 01:08:37,741
and then I'll come up with a
whole, new Christmas day plan.

840
01:08:37,766 --> 01:08:43,508
In the meantime, you might wanna leave
the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand.

841
01:08:44,828 --> 01:08:47,663
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go...

842
01:08:48,179 --> 01:08:51,279
So the doctor says, the bad news is
you don't have that long to live.

843
01:08:51,304 --> 01:08:52,718
So the patient says,
how long do I have?

844
01:08:52,743 --> 01:08:55,797
The doctor says, five.
The guy says, five what?

845
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:00,037
The doctor says, 4, 3, 2...

846
01:09:07,266 --> 01:09:09,213
Can I help you ladies?

847
01:09:11,224 --> 01:09:13,226
Oh, I do hope so.

848
01:09:16,565 --> 01:09:21,569
Now, I heard you might be able to point
me in the direction of a, a friend of mine.

849
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,601
Name of Wade Wilson.

850
01:09:23,985 --> 01:09:26,987
Sorry, I don't know the name.

851
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:36,996
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.

852
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:41,561
I've seen this girl.

853
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:45,609
This must be Vanessa. I've
heard so much about you.

854
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:51,561
Um, sweetheart, you might
wanna look around.

855
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:54,653
This isn't really the place
to do something like that.

856
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:59,185
Easy, Angel. Put
the little man down.

857
01:10:00,603 --> 01:10:03,605
- We have everything we need now.
- You sure?

858
01:10:04,544 --> 01:10:07,533
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?

859
01:10:07,584 --> 01:10:10,487
Have fun at your midnight
showing of Blade II.

860
01:10:12,785 --> 01:10:15,887
Whew!
Thanks for having my back, guys.

861
01:10:20,767 --> 01:10:24,774
Wade, we have a fucking
problem, by we, I mean you.

862
01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:30,744
I can't believe we're doing this. Is there
a word for half-afraid, half-angry?

863
01:10:30,962 --> 01:10:34,954
Yea.. "Afrangry", I guess. Have you
decided what you're gonna say to her?

864
01:10:34,986 --> 01:10:38,274
- Fuck me!
- Maybe not start with that.

865
01:10:43,858 --> 01:10:49,862
Hey, coming on to our stage
right now, give it up for Chastity!

866
01:10:53,848 --> 01:10:55,839
Or as I like to call her, Irony.

867
01:10:55,864 --> 01:10:58,075
I gotta find her fast,
before numb nuts does.

868
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:02,497
- How do you know she's in here?
- Cause I am constantly stalking that fox.

869
01:11:02,521 --> 01:11:04,287
♪ I could just roll up♪
♪ Cause I'm swole up♪

870

♪I set records, ratchets hold up♪

874
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:31,112
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time.

875
01:11:32,045 --> 01:11:34,540
Especially from this angle.

876
01:11:57,711 --> 01:12:01,710
You can't buy love, but you
can rent it for three minutes.

877
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:07,176
You weak motherfucker!

878
01:12:08,091 --> 01:12:09,200
C'mon.

879
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:14,083
C'mon. Get it together, this isn't
about you, this is about Vanessa.

880
01:12:17,927 --> 01:12:19,527
Here we go.

881
01:12:21,876 --> 01:12:23,878
Maximum effort.

882
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:28,560
Vanessa!

883
01:12:30,227 --> 01:12:36,232
Someone out back asking for you.
Something about, an old boyfriend?

884
01:13:01,985 --> 01:13:06,989
I knew it was you. 'Cause
we're weird curvy edges.

885
01:13:08,389 --> 01:13:10,390
Like a jigsaw puzzle.

886
01:13:20,351 --> 01:13:23,353
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.

887
01:13:31,404 --> 01:13:31,896
Hey...

888
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:33,459
Hey, where did she go?

889
01:13:33,484 --> 01:13:36,609
I saw her head to the back.
Go get her, tiger.

890
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:05,861
Motherfucker!

891
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,923
- Wade, Wade, Wade, Wade...
- Cunt! Chocolate...

892
01:14:08,948 --> 01:14:18,414
- We can talk... or you can hit that...
- Jiminy... Fuckmas! Fuck, FUCK..

893
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:21,524
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Relax, relax. Okay...

894
01:14:21,549 --> 01:14:28,603
I'm gonna rip his motherfucking... find
that, find it, or I'm gonna get angry.

895
01:14:30,852 --> 01:14:34,391
Here, this is Vanessa.
No, wait, it's Francis.

896
01:14:34,416 --> 01:14:37,259
- He wants you to come to him.
- What is that?

897
01:14:37,284 --> 01:14:40,963
That's the shit emoji. It's the turd
with the smiling face and the eyes.

898
01:14:40,988 --> 01:14:43,855
I thought it was chocolate
yogurt for so long.

899
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,481
- I need guns.
- Okay, which ones?

900
01:14:46,506 --> 01:14:49,107
- I need all the guns!
- All right, okay.

901
01:15:09,413 --> 01:15:14,417
- That's about 3000 rounds.
- And we all know what I can do with 12.

902
01:15:14,442 --> 01:15:17,745
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie Milsap, we're downrange.

903
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:23,787
I was gonna spend the night assembling
the BÖRJE but this is holding my interest.

904
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:26,797
- I told you, we're going
with the URDVÄRSCH, not the BÖRJE

905
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:28,782
get it thru your head
or get outta Fucktown!

906
01:15:28,807 --> 01:15:29,937
Shit.

907
01:15:29,962 --> 01:15:31,235
That's all the
pieces in the house.

908
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,541
No, no, no, come on. Let's go.
Cough it up.

909
01:15:33,565 --> 01:15:35,565
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up...

910
01:15:36,324 --> 01:15:39,326
- Down, down, down, down.
- Fuck you.

911
01:15:40,522 --> 01:15:43,525
45 cal. I like it.

912
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:46,559
Wade...

913
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:51,922
I'd go with you, but...
I don't wanna.

914
01:15:53,736 --> 01:15:56,739
Oh, listen, Al...

915
01:15:57,442 --> 01:16:02,446
If I never see you again, I want you
to know that I love you very much.

916
01:16:03,549 --> 01:16:05,393
And also,

917
01:16:05,654 --> 01:16:08,786
there's about 116 kilos of cocaine
buried somewhere in the apartment,

918
01:16:08,811 --> 01:16:10,568
right next to the cure for blindness.

919
01:16:10,593 --> 01:16:12,494
Good luck.

920
01:16:17,137 --> 01:16:18,590
You wanna get fucked up?

921
01:16:28,475 --> 01:16:30,384
Put her down over here.

922
01:16:40,202 --> 01:16:41,890
Go on, then.

923
01:16:43,822 --> 01:16:50,064
- Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.
- You're a talker, too. You and Wade.

924
01:16:50,089 --> 01:16:53,516
I've been trying to tell you
assholes you got the wrong girl.

925
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:55,126
My old boyfriend, he's dead.

926
01:16:55,151 --> 01:17:01,924
See, I thought that, too. But he keeps on
coming back. Like a cockroach, but uglier.

927
01:17:02,647 --> 01:17:10,053
Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see
how he fights with your head on the block.

928
01:17:17,857 --> 01:17:21,860
- Ripley! From Alien 3!
- Fuck, you're old.

929
01:17:22,775 --> 01:17:27,040
Fake laugh! Hiding real pain!
Go get Silver balls.

930
01:17:27,329 --> 01:17:29,805
You guys going for a bite?
Early bird special?

931
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:33,336
Oh, like there's something wrong with eating
before sundown or saving money. No.

932
01:17:33,361 --> 01:17:37,829
You know that bad guy that
you let go? He's got my girl.

933
01:17:38,646 --> 01:17:42,243
- You're gonna help me get her back.
- Wade? Is that you?

934
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:46,386
Yeah, it's me Deadpool, and I got
an offer that you can't refuse!

935
01:17:49,427 --> 01:17:51,341
I'm gonna wait out here,
okay? It's a big house!

936
01:17:51,335 --> 01:17:52,897
It's funny that I only ever see 2 of you.

937
01:17:52,922 --> 01:17:56,041
It's almost like, the studio
couldn't afford another X-Men.

938
01:17:58,519 --> 01:18:03,824
And that, is why in my opinion, the
movie Cocoon, is pure pornography.

939
01:18:04,808 --> 01:18:08,847
- Who brought this twinkly man?
- Twinkly, but deadly.

940
01:18:08,872 --> 01:18:12,965
My chrome-penised friend back there,
has agreed to do me this solid.

941
01:18:13,129 --> 01:18:17,308
In exchange, I said I would
consider joining his boy band.

942
01:18:17,333 --> 01:18:20,533
- It's not boy band.
- Sure, it's not.

943
01:18:20,558 --> 01:18:23,611
So, any luck winning Gita back?

944
01:18:23,636 --> 01:18:25,800
I tried to hold on
tight, Mr. Pool,

945
01:18:25,825 --> 01:18:29,957
but Bandu is more craftier
and handsomer than me.

946
01:18:29,982 --> 01:18:32,884
Well, I think you're
pretty darn cute.

947
01:18:38,054 --> 01:18:40,056
- Dopinder?
- Hmm?

948
01:18:41,219 --> 01:18:50,414
- What was that?
- That was........ Bandu, in the trunk?

949
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:53,673
- Ban-who?
- My romantic rival, Bandu.

950
01:18:53,698 --> 01:18:56,377
He's tied up in the trunk.
I'm doing as you said, DP,

951
01:18:56,402 --> 01:19:00,544
I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish
then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.

952
01:19:01,289 --> 01:19:05,781
I did not tell him to do that! Absolutely
not! We got lost in translation!

953
01:19:05,806 --> 01:19:10,126
Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's
heart back! (I'm so proud of you.)

954
01:19:10,151 --> 01:19:13,596
Drop Bandu off safe
and gentle-like. (Kill him.)

955
01:19:13,621 --> 01:19:19,910
And then, win Gita back the old-fashioned
way, with your boyish charm! (Kidnap her.)

956
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:23,204
He's super dead.

957
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:31,686
- I presume a crisp high-five?
- For you? Ten!

958
01:19:32,526 --> 01:19:37,041
Okay, guys, let's get out there and make
a difference! (You know what to do.)

959
01:19:38,368 --> 01:19:40,352
Knock 'em dead, pool boy!

960
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,752
Time to make the
chimi-fucking-changas.

961
01:19:45,681 --> 01:19:47,446
Not often a dude ruins your face,

962
01:19:47,471 --> 01:19:48,838
skullstomps your sanity,

963
01:19:48,863 --> 01:19:51,926
grabs your future baby mama
and personally sees to 4

Leave a message and have a happy day!

Wade Wilson!

984
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:07,177
What's my name?

985
01:21:07,575 --> 01:21:10,609
Ooh, I'mma fucking
spell it out for 'ya.

986
01:21:12,064 --> 01:21:13,065
Go get some.

987
01:21:13,145 --> 01:21:17,146
Superhero landing. She's gonna do
a superhero landing, wait for it!

988
01:21:20,915 --> 01:21:24,067
Superhero landing! You know,
that's really hard on your knees.

989
01:21:24,263 --> 01:21:26,113
Totally impractical,
they all do it.

990
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:30,839
You're a lovely lady but I'm saving myself
for Francis. That's why I brought him.

991
01:21:30,864 --> 01:21:34,135
I'd prefer not to hit a
woman, so please...

992
01:21:41,235 --> 01:21:44,237
I mean, that's
why I brought her?

993
01:21:45,633 --> 01:21:50,695
Oh no. Finish your tweet. Just give us
a second. Here you go. Hash tag it.

994
01:21:52,336 --> 01:21:54,079
Go get her, tiger.

995
01:22:01,172 --> 01:22:05,175
I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.

996
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:07,403
Alright then. Fire!

997
01:22:18,569 --> 01:22:20,545
Finish fucking her the fuck up!

998
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:22,468
- Language, please.
- Suck a cock!

999
01:22:48,698 --> 01:22:52,451
Look away, child. Look away!

1000
01:22:59,367 --> 01:23:04,128
- Wait! Wait!
- Cease fire! Cease fire!

1001
01:23:04,533 --> 01:23:11,346
Fellas, hey, you only work for
that shit-spackled Muppet fart.

1002
01:23:11,371 --> 01:23:13,277
So, I'mma give you a chance

1003
01:23:13,586 --> 01:23:17,000
for y'all to lay down your firearms
in exchange for preferential,

1004
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:20,233
bordering on gentle, possibly...

1005
01:23:20,258 --> 01:23:21,703
even lover-like treatment.

1006
01:23:23,979 --> 01:23:26,406
Fine! Commando!

1007
01:24:38,599 --> 01:24:40,000
Teabag!

1008
01:24:43,832 --> 01:24:46,785
- Bob?
- Wade?

1009
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:48,872
- Oh my God, I haven't seen you since...
- Jacksonville.

1010
01:24:48,897 --> 01:24:50,279
- TGIFridays!
- Fridays.

1011
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:55,555
What the hell! God!
Come here, you.

1012
01:24:57,351 --> 01:25:01,452
How are the kids? Good? And Gail, is
she still fixing that tuna casserole?

1013
01:25:01,477 --> 01:25:04,547
It's so good, ugh, but bad for the waistline
if you know what I am talking about...

1014
01:25:11,251 --> 01:25:14,516
Your... on the left...
You are beautiful...

1015
01:25:14,541 --> 01:25:18,127
That is so sweet! Thanks!

1016
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,262
Yoo-Hoo!

1017
01:25:30,367 --> 01:25:34,370
Does he write you notes,
too? He's such a romantic.

1018
01:25:34,395 --> 01:25:35,895
Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.

1019
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:38,403
Fire!

1020
01:25:45,567 --> 01:25:49,204
Hey! Climb on.

1021
01:26:25,457 --> 01:26:27,283
Mothafuckin...

1022
01:26:38,561 --> 01:26:41,389
Motherfucker shoulda
worn his brown pants.

1023
01:26:43,682 --> 01:26:48,164
You were right, beautiful.
Red really is my color.

1024
01:26:48,189 --> 01:26:49,127
Wade?

1025
01:26:49,152 --> 01:26:53,105
Don't worry, baby. I'mma
get you outta that shitbox.

1026
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:55,489
What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours.

1027
01:26:55,514 --> 01:26:57,130
Oh, you never left.

1028
01:26:57,466 --> 01:27:01,369
- But you did, asshole!
- Deep breath, darling.

1029
01:27:02,486 --> 01:27:07,490
No wait.... Wrong
choice of words.

1030
01:27:08,533 --> 01:27:11,462
Well I hope they've blocked
pain to your every last nerve.

1031
01:27:11,487 --> 01:27:12,797
'Cause I'mma go looking!

1032
01:27:13,882 --> 01:27:16,361
I hear you grow back
body parts now, Wade.

1033
01:27:16,596 --> 01:27:19,420
When I'm finished, part's
will have to grow back you.

1034
01:27:19,562 --> 01:27:23,315
Good one.... Yup.
That was a good one.

1035
01:27:23,893 --> 01:27:28,721
Let's dance. And by "dance", I
mean let's try to kill each other.

1036
01:28:22,853 --> 01:28:27,331

01:33:25,504 --> 01:33:31,608
Did you really think
there was a cure, for that?

1065
01:33:31,961 --> 01:33:35,964
- What?
- You heard me.

1066
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:43,642
No, no!
[groans]

1067
01:33:45,801 --> 01:33:53,807
So, you mean to say...
After all this, you can't fix me?

1068
01:33:54,409 --> 01:33:56,604
It sounds even
stupider when you say it.

1069
01:33:56,629 --> 01:34:01,232
Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't
do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?

1070
01:34:05,582 --> 01:34:07,583
Any last words?

1071
01:34:09,183 --> 01:34:12,886
- What's my name?
- Who fucking cares!

1072
01:34:12,911 --> 01:34:14,413
Wade!

1073
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:18,995
- Four or five moments.
- I'm sorry?

1074
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:22,246
Four or five moments,
that's all it takes.

1075
01:34:22,271 --> 01:34:23,816
To...?

1076
01:34:24,165 --> 01:34:26,066
Be a hero.

1077
01:34:27,506 --> 01:34:31,704
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job.
Wake up a hero.

1078
01:34:31,729 --> 01:34:35,651
Brush your teeth a hero. Go
to work a hero. Not true.

1079
01:34:36,481 --> 01:34:41,485
Over a lifetime, there are only 4
or 5 moments that really matter.

1080
01:34:42,139 --> 01:34:44,696
Moments when you're
offered a choice.

1081
01:34:44,721 --> 01:34:48,724
To make a sacrifice, conquer
a flaw, save a friend...

1082
01:34:49,436 --> 01:34:52,697
spare an enemy.

1083
01:34:52,722 --> 01:34:57,792
In these moments,
everything else falls away.

1084
01:34:58,433 --> 01:35:03,557
The way the world sees us.
The way we...

1085
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:07,968
Why?

1086
01:35:08,103 --> 01:35:14,087
You were droning on! Sure, I may be
stuck looking like pepperoni flat bread.

1087
01:35:14,112 --> 01:35:16,658
But at least fuck-face
won't heal from that.

1088
01:35:16,683 --> 01:35:20,142
If wearing superhero tights

1089
01:35:20,167 --> 01:35:23,948
means sparing psychopaths then
maybe I wasn't meant to wear them.

1090
01:35:23,973 --> 01:35:27,902
- Not everyone martyred as a hall like you.
- Just promise...

1091
01:35:27,927 --> 01:35:32,599
Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the look
out for the next four moments.

1092
01:35:33,067 --> 01:35:36,444
Now if you'll excuse
me, I'm just a boy,

1093
01:35:36,949 --> 01:35:40,456
about to stand in front of
a girl, and tell her...

1094
01:35:40,481 --> 01:35:45,934
- What the fuck am I gonna tell her?
- Well, you better figure it out.

1095
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:50,192
I can't even tell you... I
deserve that... that too..

1096
01:35:50,217 --> 01:35:52,201
No, no, no, maybe
not the nethers.

1097
01:35:52,226 --> 01:35:54,428
Start talking!

1098
01:35:55,982 --> 01:36:03,188
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For
everything. I'm sorry for leaving,

1099
01:36:04,286 --> 01:36:06,590
I'm sorry for not
cowboying up sooner...

1100
01:36:06,615 --> 01:36:08,568
It's been a rough
couple of years.

1101
01:36:08,593 --> 01:36:09,993
Rough?

1102
01:36:16,941 --> 01:36:21,945
I live in a crackhouse.
With a family of 12...

1103
01:36:23,221 --> 01:36:26,400
Every night we spoon for warmth,
everybody fights for Noelle.

1104
01:36:26,425 --> 01:36:27,618
She's the fattest.

1105
01:36:27,643 --> 01:36:33,900
There is nothing that we don't share.
Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.

1106
01:36:41,765 --> 01:36:44,448
So you live in a house?

1107
01:36:52,876 --> 01:36:55,878
I should've come
and found you sooner.

1108
01:36:57,292 --> 01:37:02,296
But everything under this mask,
he ain't the same one you remember.

1109
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,794
You mean this mask?

1110
01:37:27,003 --> 01:37:32,307
And this one. In case
the other fell off.

1111
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:41,003
Yea just... OW... like a band-aid.
Just give... Audi 5000.

1112
01:37:41,027 --> 01:37:43,027
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1113
01:37:44,085 --> 01:37:45,986
Are you sure?

1114
01:37:47,043 --> 01:37:49,044
I'm sure.

1115
01:37:58,809 --> 01:38:01,812
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1116
01:38:08,922 --> 01:38:10,084
Hey

1117
01:38:12,518 --> 01:38:17,522
After a brief adjustment period,
and a bunch of drinks..

1118
01:38:17,956 --> 01:38:20,868
It's a face...

1119
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:27,222
I'd be happy to sit on.

1120
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:38,148
But I'm not the same
underneath this suit either.

1121
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,898
Super-penis.

1122
01:38:40,923 --> 01:38:44,887
Come on, Wade, language.
Young one is present.

1123
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:48,513
Whudya... What are you still doing...
Get outta here,

1124
01:38:48,538 --> 01:38:50,013
go make yourself useful.

1125
01:38:50,038 --> 01:38:52,887
You, go be a really big
brother to someone.

1126
01:38:52,912 --> 01:38:54,739
Tell Beast to stop
shitting on my lawn.

1127
01:38:54,764 --> 01:38:56,608
And you, chicken noodle.

1128
01:38:56,633 --> 01:39:00,672
Nothing Compares 2 U. Sinead
O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.

1129
01:39:00,697 --> 01:39:03,517
That's all right. You're cool.

1130
01:39:05,337 --> 01:39:07,202
What in the ass?

1131
01:39:07,227 --> 01:39:10,420
That was not mean!
I'm proud of you!

1132
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:13,812
We will make an X-Man
of you yet, Wade.

1133
01:39:13,837 --> 01:39:15,141
You know, for a second there,

1134
01:39:15,166 --> 01:39:19,913
it felt like we were 3 mini lion robots
coming together to form one super robot.

1135
01:39:19,914 --> 01:39:22,648
- There's the stupid.
- Yeah.

1136
01:39:25,762 --> 01:39:30,766
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

1137
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:35,668
Come here.

1138
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:48,843
WHAM! As promised.

1139
01:40:00,946 --> 01:40:04,949
See? You don't need to be
a superhero to get the girl.

1140
01:40:05,729 --> 01:40:08,729
The right girl will bring
out the hero in you.

1141
01:40:09,149 --> 01:40:13,719
Now, let's finish this epic wide
shot, pull out, here we go...

1142
01:40:13,744 --> 01:40:16,885
Looks nice, not gonna be the only
thing that's pulling out tonight.

1143
01:40:16,910 --> 01:40:19,753
Who doesn't love a
happy ending, huh?

1144
01:40:20,120 --> 01:40:23,650
Until next time, this is your friendly
neighborhood Pool guy singing...

1145
01:40:23,675 --> 01:40:26,406
♪ I'm never gonna dance again ♪

1146
01:40:26,431 --> 01:40:31,189
♪ The way I dance with you, oh ♪

1147
01:46:39,715 --> 01:46:41,516
You're still here.

1148
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:47,701
It's over! Go home!

1149
01:46:48,765 --> 01:46:51,415
Oh, you're expecting a
teaser for Deadpool 2.

1150
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:52,791
Well, we don't have
that kind of money.

1151
01:46:54,105 --> 01:46:57,065
What were you expecting,
Sam Jackson'll show up?

1152
01:46:57,221 --> 01:47:01,029
Eye patch? Saucy leather number?
Go, GO.

1153
01:47:06,724 --> 01:47:10,263
Oh! But I can tell you one thing
and it's a bit of a secret.

1154
01:47:10,309 --> 01:47:11,752
In the sequel,

1155
01:47:11,777 --> 01:47:14,511
we're gonna have Cable.
Amazing character.

1156
01:47:14,536 --> 01:47:17,561
Bionic arm, time-travel. We
have no idea who to cast yet,

1157
01:47:17,586 --> 01:47:20,068
but it could be anybody. Just
take a big guy with a flat top.

1158
01:47:20,093 --> 01:47:22,750
Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph
Lundgren, Keira Knightley.

1159
01:47:22,775 --> 01:47:25,837
She's got range, who knows?
Anyway, big secret.

1160
01:47:25,862 --> 01:47:27,768
Oh, and don't leave your
garbage all laying around.

1161
01:47:27,793 --> 01:47:32,277
It's a total dick move. Go.

1162
01:47:34,359 --> 01:47:36,359
Chicka, Chicka...
