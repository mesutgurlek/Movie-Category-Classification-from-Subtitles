Well?
DDS were carrying out
a routine drugs raid

159
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:18,865
when they found
the infected victims.

160
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:23,808
It's the Reaper virus.
Oh, my God.

161
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,877
It's back.

162
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:35,582
Bloody Hell, George.
What's got your
knickers in a twist?

163
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:39,419
National emergency,
I'm afraid. Briefing for
the PM in five minutes.

164
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:42,119
HATCHER: Let's keep this
informal and to the point.

165
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:44,856
We all know what's at stake,
why you're here.

166
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:46,522
Jane.

167
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:50,261
In 2023, when the rising
tidal waters were threatening
to flood London,

168
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:52,633
we extended the Thames
flood barrier.

169
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:54,832
Like a castle moat,
this system of canals

170
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:57,603
encircles the entire capital
north of the river.

171
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,406
Our immediate plan is to
flood the canals, blockade
all bridges, tube lines

172
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:04,874
and rail links
in and out of the city.

173
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:07,282
You want to put
12 million people
under lock and key?

174
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:11,379
Containment is our absolute
priority. We must implement
martial law now.

175
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:12,651
Keep the people
off the streets

176
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,227
while we secure the blockade
and set up medical stations.

177
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:17,990
Only then can we begin
the evacuation.
HATCHER: Do it.

178
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:20,622
It's all very well packing
people into their homes

179
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,564
like so many
million sardines,

180
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:25,159
but you drop a killer virus
into that mix,

181
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:28,104
and this town
is gonna go tits-up
in no short order.

182
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:31,870
Once you start stacking
bodies in the streets,
there'll be panic,

183
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:36,847
public disorder,
looting, rape, murder,
and that's just for starters.

184
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:38,940
The death toll will
be unimaginable,

185
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,767
and by that time,
there'll be absolutely
fuck-all we can do about it.

186
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:47,400
You have to think
of the millions that
we'll be saving.

187
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,946
Are you talking about people?
Or pound notes?

188
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:55,751
Chief Nelson,
would you join me
in my office?

189
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:01,884
If this is a bollocking,
make it quick.

190
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:04,391
I've got a job to do,
I need to be out there
on the streets.

191
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:05,586
Michael.

192
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:07,959
What we're about to show you
is highly confidential

193
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:10,396
and potentially
volatile material.

194
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,661
When the wall went up,
the government at that
time, naturally,

195
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:14,066
wanted to know
what was happening
on the other side.

196
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:18,153
So they re-tasked one of
their military satellites

197
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,487
to provide coverage
of Edinburgh and Glasgow.

198
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:24,359
For the past 30 years,
it's carried on
taking pictures,

199
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:29,560
sending down what you'd
expect. Empty cities,
deserted streets.

200
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:33,105
That is,
until three years ago,
when these turned up.

201
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:41,938
HATCHER: People.

202
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:43,572
On the streets of Glasgow.

203
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:46,151
Survivors?
What else could it be?

204
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:50,186
And if there are survivors,
there must surely be a cure.

205
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:52,086
What we have to do
is get our hands on it.

206
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:54,785
We already have
a team standing by.

207
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:57,560
All we need is somebody
to lead them.

208
00:16:57,663 --> 00:17:00,097
Someone to take them in,
find the cure

209
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,791
and deliver it into our hands
before it's too late
to turn the tide.

210
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:06,698
You don't know how many
survivors there are.

211
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:10,037
And the team might not find
them in time. They might
not find them at all.

212
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:12,610
And they could
still be contagious.

213
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:14,771
That's what the team's
going to find out.

214
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,281
You've known for
three fucking years
that they were up there,

215
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:20,113
but you swept it
under the carpet.

216
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:23,052
Scotland's dead
have long since
been laid to rest.

217
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:26,056
Yesterday, if I turned up
on the 6:00 news with
a survivor in tow,

218
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:29,025
they'd have strung me up
from the nearest lamp-post
by the balls.

219
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:33,792
But if, in 48 hours,
I arrive with a survivor
and a cure,

220
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:36,163
sure they won't
give a flying fuck
about the survivor,

221
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:39,169
but they'll be lining up
to kiss my arse
for that cure.

222
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:42,638
In politics,
survival is timing,
and ours is running out.

223
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:43,902
We have 48 hours.

224
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,408
I need your best man
on this, right away.

225
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:51,330
All right.

226
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:55,827
I know someone who might
just fit the bill.

227
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,866
Get in the car,
it's pissing down.

228
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:31,348
How long have they known?
Long enough.

229
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:34,482
But that doesn't matter now.
Matters to me.

230
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:36,526
There are survivors
out there.

231
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:39,461
This is not some
personal quest
I'm sending you on.

232
00:18:39,564 --> 00:18:43,193
Focus on your mission.
Who's behind it? Hatcher?

233
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:48,035
Hatcher's got the swagger
and the smiles, but it's
Canaris who pulls the strings.

234
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,301
He's the power
behind the throne.

235
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:52,843
And he's not someone
you want to pick
a fight with.

236
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:55,276
Who, me?
I'm serious.

237
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:59,742
If the truth got out,
it would bring Hatcher,
the government,

238
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:02,217
the whole fucking
system down.

239
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:06,018
And there's no way
Canaris is ever gonna
let that happen.

240
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:09,423
Once you're over that wall,
there's no rules,

241
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:11,996
no backup.
Better that way.

242
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,551
Look after this for me,
would you?

243
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:47,921
Don't suppose
you got a cigarette?

244
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:51,491
There's no smoking
on the helicopter,
and I don't smoke.

245
00:19:51,603 --> 00:19:53,002
Fair enough.

246
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:55,134
Dr. Marcus Kane,

247
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,641
he was leading
the research into the virus
when the gates were closed.

248
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:00,735
He was trapped
inside the hot zone.

249
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:04,680
His lab was located inside
the quarantine compound
in Glasgow.

250
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:08,912
If anybody was capable
of developing a cure,
it was him.

251
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,888
I suggest you start
at the lab. Pick up
the trail from there.

252
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:17,724
You'll rendezvous with
the rest of the team
at the wall,

253
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:20,627
then you'll proceed north
in two armored transports.

254
00:20:20,732 --> 00:20:24,224
Scotland is still Why not fly in?
a no-fly zone.

255
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:27,897
Hatcher needs to keep this
as low profile as possible.

256
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:31,669
So if we don't make it out,
no one will know we went in.

257
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:34,274
You've got 46 hours.

258
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:39,214
If you don't make it back,
the city of London
and everybody in it

259
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:41,308
will be left to die.

260
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:46,113
If it's there,
I'll find it.

261
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:51,161
You'll need this. It's a GPS
locator beacon. It'll tell us
exactly where you are.

262
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:55,833
We'll have a gun ship
standing by to extract
your team.

263
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:57,026
So much for low profile.

264
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:03,233
Once you have the cure,
it won't matter.

265
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:08,874
What happens if I don't
find anything up there?

266
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,813
Then you needn't
bother coming back.

What the hell are we
going to do, Canaris?

272
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:51,396
Just calm down
and listen.

273
00:21:53,226 --> 00:21:54,318
Even if,
by some miracle,

274
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:57,623
Sinclair finds
what she's looking for
and makes it back in time,

275
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,893
the fact remains,
this is our fault,
we made it happen.

276
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,436
Too many people crammed
into ghettos so tight
they can barely move.

277
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:08,267
We created the perfect
breeding ground
for a virus to take place.

278
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:09,671
And the more we save now,

00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:14,041
the more chance there is
of the same thing
happening all over again.

Yes, sir!

Twin V12 engines,
two-inch armor plate,

and they'll take anything
from 30mm rounds to
chemical weapons.

302
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:54,871
Just the ticket for
a night on the town.

What the fuck's
going on, Sinclair?

Major Sinclair.

948
01:38:38,346 --> 01:38:40,541
You had me worried
for a while.

949
01:38:41,416 --> 01:38:42,906
Do you have it?

950
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:45,617
I've got it.

951
01:38:47,055 --> 01:38:48,249
Where's the medical team?

952
01:38:48,356 --> 01:38:51,792
Let's not
make this difficult.
You've done a good job.

953
01:38:52,494 --> 01:38:53,654
We'll take it from here.

954

Stirling,
bring her out.

955
01:39:04,372 --> 01:39:07,569
You have to forgive Stirling.
He's very involved
with his work.

956
01:39:07,676 --> 01:39:09,701
Okay. Let's go.

957

We understand
the need for sacrifice.

958

The longer we leave it,
the better shape we'll be

Making you the hero

You said you had the cure.
Where is it?

962
01:39:28,663 --> 01:39:31,257
She's the cure.
The survivors
are immune.

963
01:39:31,366 --> 01:39:34,062
We can use her blood
to make a vaccine.

964
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:37,900
Hand her over.
She's not going
anywhere without me.

Get behind me.

So that's it?

I've got nothing left
to bargain with.

I've done my job.

972

Now it's your turn.
A lot of good people
died for this!

Is that all
it was to you?

A job?

975
01:40:11,957 --> 01:40:13,151
That's right.

976
01:40:15,711 --> 01:40:17,474
Now, take her and go.

you've got a cigarette?

I'll get you all the

Never better.

How'd you find me?

987
01:42:23,939 --> 01:42:26,237
I used to be
a policeman once.

988

I don't need it anymore.

what he wanted?

He did.

992

I have a feeling
he'll be holding
onto it for awhile.

Don't worry.

He gave me something
in return.

you'll need to bring
Canaris down.
