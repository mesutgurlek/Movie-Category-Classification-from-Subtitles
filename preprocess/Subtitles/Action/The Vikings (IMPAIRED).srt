<i>(narrator) The Vikings in Europe</i>
<i>of the eighth and ninth century</i>

2
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,065
<i>were dedicated to a pagan</i>
<i>god of war, Odin.</i>

3
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,300
<i>Cramped by the confines</i>
<i>of their barren, icebound northlands,</i>

4
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,864
<i>they exploited their skill</i>
<i>as shipbuilders</i>

5
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,984
<i>to spread a reign of terror</i>
<i>then unequalled in violence and brutality</i>

6
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,863
<i>in all the records of history.</i>

7
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,301
<i>The greatest wish of every Viking</i>

8
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,343
<i>was to die sword in hand</i>
<i>and enter Valhalla,</i>

9
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,019
<i>where a hero's welcome</i>
<i>awaited them from the god Odin.</i>

10
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,580
<i>The compass was unknown,</i>

11
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,464
<i>and they could steer only</i>
<i>by the sun and the stars.</i>

12
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,461
<i>Once fog closed in,</i>
<i>they were left helpless and blind.</i>

13
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,024
<i>After all, the earth was flat.</i>

14
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,779
<i>Sail too far off course,</i>
<i>and the black wind would blow them</i>

15
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,424
<i>across the poison sea</i>
<i>that lay to the west</i>

16
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,906
<i>and over the edge of the world</i>
<i>into limbo.</i>

17
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,303
<i>Their abiding aim</i>
<i>was to conquer England,</i>

18
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,902
<i>then a series of petty kingdoms,</i>
<i>each one the jealous rival of the next.</i>

19
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,185
<i>Thus, when the Vikings set forth</i>
<i>to rob and plunder England,</i>

20
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,063
<i>they never sailed out</i>
<i>of sight of land.</i>

21
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,069
<i>They confined their attacks</i>
<i>to swift overnight raids.</i>

22
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,468
<i>It was no accident that the English book</i>
<i>of prayer contained this sentence:</i>

23
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,629
<i>"Protect us, oh Lord,</i>
<i>from the wrath of the Northmen."</i>

24
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,948
- <i>(man)</i> Ragnar!
- <i>(yelling outside)</i>

25
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,106
<i>(screaming)</i>

<i>(woman continues screaming)</i>

<i>(woman sobbing)</i>

<i>(choir singing)</i>

29
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,869
The king is dead. Long live the king.

30
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,588
For two months we have mourned
the good King Edwin,

31
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,146
who by the cruel Viking Ragnar
was foully murdered,

32
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,979
and still lies unrevenged.

33
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,742
The council of the kingdom now declare
that Aella is of the true royal line

34
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,306
and welcome his succession
to the throne.

35
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,386
<i>(choir continues singing)</i>

36
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,459
Your Majesty.

37
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,150
Thank you, my gracious lady.

38
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,899
Rest assured that the barbarians
that murdered your husband, my cousin,

39
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,579
will soon feel the weight of my anger.

40
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,508
And though your union with Edwin
was fruitless,

41
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,669
feel confident that you retain
the respect of us all.

42
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,742
You may retire... Queen Enid.

43
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,665
<i>(priests)</i> We, Thurston Bishop
and Matthew Bishop,

44
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,181
ask you, will you take Aella
as your king and accept...

45
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,859
You need not fear, my lady.
His words cannot hurt you.

46
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,868
He has no right to the throne.

47
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,743
There is no direct heir, my lady.

48
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,065
There is an heir.

49
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,825
What?

50
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,307
Brother Godwin, I am with child.
But not Edwin's.

51
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,945
The child is that of the Viking, Ragnar.

52
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,306
<i>(choir singing)</i>

53
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,864
<i>(recites in Latin)</i>

54
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,026
A bad omen.

55
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,864
The holy sword Requitur,
the sword of kings.

56
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,867
<i>(crowd)</i> Long live the king!

57
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:22,067
<i>(Enid)</i> He is the son of a barbarian...
but I love him as if he were Edwin's child.

58
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,263
There are already rumours of his birth.
If they were to reach Aella...

59
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,142
Where are you sending him?

60
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:33,139
To Italy, to be tended by monks
who will not know his identity.

61
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,024
But his life will be safe, and yours too.

62
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,505
Father Godwin!

63
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,185
- The pommelstone of the sword Requitur.
- <i>(Enid)</i> It is his by right.

64
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:53,101
If you hope to identify him in years to
come by this stone, so can his enemies.

65
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,582
<i>(narrator) "o years passed.</i>
<i>Queen Enid had died,</i>

66
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,067
<i>but the rumour that she had given birth</i>
<i>to a son continued to plague Kink Aella.</i>

67
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,102
<i>Although his castle became</i>
<i>the stronghold of all England,</i>

68
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,381
<i>Aella was unable to stop</i>
<i>the Viking raids.</i>

69
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,580
Now let it be known throughout
the kingdom of Northumbria

70
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,340
that I, King Rhodri of Wales,
bestow on King Aella

71
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,019
the hand of my daughter, Morgana.

72
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,505
I will consent to this.

73
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,946
I, too, King Rhodri of Wales, consent.

74
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,742
Praise be to God.

75
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,065
<i>(crowd)</i> Amen.

76
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,139
Please rise, child.

77
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,783
On the first day of spring,
you will become my bride.

78
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,990
I trust, Lord Egbert,
that you approve of this alliance?

79
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,543
With all my heart, sire.

80
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,709
Then why do you spread tales of an heir
to the throne left by Queen Enid?

81
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,264
<i>(crowd murmuring)</i>

"Tis common knowledge, sire.

83

The queen on her deathbed
spoke of a son sent off to Italy

84
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,428
with the pommelstone of the
sword Requitur tied about him.

85
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,543
Your Majesty, is it wise to speak
of things so long in the past?

86
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,061
I hope soon to silence
these wagging tongues.

87
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,421
This beautiful child will present me
with an heir to the throne.

88
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,223
And this marriage
will combine our strengths

89
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,501
and protect our people
from the depredation of the Vikings.

<i>(chattering)</i>

That is not enough!

I must also expose
a traitor in our midst.

93
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,069
Surely there are no traitors
in this hall, sire.

94
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:01,262
Cousin Egbert... why have your lands
never been attacked by the Vikings?

95
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,343
What do you mean, sire?

96
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,349
Neither your lands nor those of your
conspirators have suffered any harm.

- Conspirators?!
- You have schemed against me.

98

I'll not be the scapegoat
for your failure to stop the Vikings!

99
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,748
You have conspired with the foes
of England to dethrone me!

- What foes?
- The Vikings! Take him out!

Lies will not sustain a tyrant!

102

Use skill. It must appear
as if he took his own life.

00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:55,222
- He's gone, sire!
- Hunt him down.

00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,667
Here. Bring up Long Claw.

156
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,588
Look, now there's a hunting bird.

157
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,465
- You again. Whose bird is that?
- It's mine.

158
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,821
Oh? A slave with a hunting hawk?

159
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,499
- I found her frozen to a tree.
- Where'd you steal it?

160
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,190
Sandpiper was with me when I found her.

161
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:54,225
The perfect witness - deaf and dumb.
Perhaps you'd like <i>your</i> tongue cut out.

162
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,308
- Then you'd tell no more lies.
- I'm not a liar.

163
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,941
Is this the way slaves talk to Vikings?

164
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,070
Tell the English lord that you're a liar.

165
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,825
Kill!

166
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,986
Kill him!

167
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,466
<i>(Einar)</i> No!

168
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,102
Don't kill him.

169
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,745
<i>(crowd cheering)</i>

170
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,182
Odin!

171
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,143
<i>(all)</i> Odin!

172
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,258
Bring in the slave.

173
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,944
Look how he glares at me.

174
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:56,098
If he wasn't fathered by a black ram in
the full of the moon, my name is not Ragnar.

175
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,179
What would you do with him
in your country?

176
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,905
We have a special reward which is
rather entertaining in a noisy way.

177
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,340
- What's that?
- Nothing much, just a pit full of wolves,

178
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,861
half mad with starvation and trained
to appreciate the flavour of human blood.

179
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,302
Ah, you see!
The English <i>are</i> civilised.

180
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,787
- Can you think of anything worse?
- I can think of something far worse.

181
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,267
I guess you can, with your
pretty dainty face spoiled.

182
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,029
But he was a good slave. Kill him quick.

183
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:33,429
- No. No quick death for him.
- What do you suggest I do with him?

184
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,264
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

185
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,058
I want this slave alive.

186
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,499
After tearing your face apart?

187
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,949
Yes.

188
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,825
The sun will cross the sky
a thousand times before he dies.

189
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:03,067
And you'll wish a thousand times
that you were dead.

190
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,786
<i>(Ragnar)</i> Kitala!

191
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,858
You can't kill the slave.

192
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,025
What do the runes say?

193
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:40,180
If Odin willed that Eric should die, Thor's
hammer would sound his death knell.

194
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,422
But the sky is silent.

195
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,787
The curse of Odin waits on him
who kills the slave.

196
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:12,946
Then no <i>man</i> shall kill him.
Let the tide of the sea do it.

197
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,703
Bind him, cast him into the slop-pool
at low tide! Take him out!

198
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,427
You'll throw him into the slop-pool
to be drowned and eaten by crabs?

199
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,145
Then let the crabs be cursed by Odin!
That's my decision.

200
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,025
If he survives the pool, what then?

201
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,265
If he's still alive when the tide turns,

202
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,348
then any fool who fishes him out
can have him!

203
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,426
Survives!

204
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,385
Odin! Odin!

205
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:24,502
Send a wind and turn the tide.

206
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,229
Odin! Odin!

207
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,304
Odin!

208
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,739
Put her on the testing board.

209
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,949
I think I'll go and watch
that slave drowning.

210
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,824
Stay here!
You'll see something more interesting.

211
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,784
It does look rather an interesting game.

212
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:22,028
It's not a game.
It's Odin's test for unfaithful wives.

213
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,305
Is she an unfaithful wife?

214
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,345
- Ask Einar.
- Her husband says she is.

215
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,268
- Which is he?
- He's throwing the axes.

216
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,421
But, uh... if she's innocent?

217
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,906
Her husband will succeed,
the braids will be cut.

218
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:02,870
Supposing he misses
the braids and hits her?

219
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,539
- Well, then she's guilty.
- I see.

220
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,541
But what happens if he misses
both the girl and the braids?

221
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,468
Three misses and we drown <i>himl</i>

222
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,506
One!

223
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:01,464
You're too drunk!
You'll split her wide open!

224
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,750
Drunk, am I? I haven't had enough!

225
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,026
<i>(cheering)</i>

226
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,380
You missed her, didn't you?

227
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,305
What a son!

228
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,941
Kitala.

229
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,982
Kitala, my legs, my legs...

230
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,659
Move your legs, Eric.
You must move them.

231
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:52,342
- Where did this slave boy come from?
- Bjorn brought him here from a raid.

232
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,746
He was taken from a ship on the sea.

233
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,509
- And this was found about his neck?
- Yes.

234
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,669
It's the only possession he ever had.
He has no need of it now.

235
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,621
<i>(Eric splutters)</i>

236
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,825
He's going to die.

237
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:19,388
Listen to me, little slave. Einar is
in the hall celebrating your death!

238
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,104
Einar is laughing at you!

239
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,698
Einar... Einar.

240
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:30,059
- Live, Eric. Fight the cold.
- Live and fight Einar.

241
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,708
Fight Einar. Fight Einar.

242
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,627
Odin. Odin.

243
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,627
Odin!

244
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,820
- Odin has answered you.
- They were only flying clouds.

245
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,341
You're blind.
They were Odin's daughters.

246
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:07,066
I heard the singing of their battle
swords as they rode across the sky.

247
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,306
They bring the wind.

248
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,786
They bring the wind!

249
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,105
Listen to it.

250
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,746
<i>(wind whistling)</i>

251
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,148
<i>(laughter)</i>

252
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:30,384
The north wind, it's turning back
the tide. Cut him loose.

253
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,139
The tide is going out. Your job is done.

254
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,864
<i>(Einar)</i> I'll take the slave.

255
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:23,828
He's mine, Einar! The wind
turned the tide and I pulled him out.

256
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,510
I'll take him, Englishman.

257
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,781
If your father's word
means anything, he's mine.

258
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,425
Why such a sudden interest
in a slave, my lord?

259
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,667
Shall we say, an English passion
for converting the wicked

260
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,180
to the paths of righteousness.

261
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,862
Well, you're not in England now.

262
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:50,148
And you never will be unless
I draw maps of England for your father.

263
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,980
All right.

264
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,501
You can keep the slave...
for as long as you live.

265
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:16,702
- Odin's thanks for saving him.
- And at no little risk to myself.

266
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,549
Do you know what this is?

267
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,584
Some day, I'll tell you what it is.

268
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,259
And you'll remember then
that I saved you.

269
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,148
I'm still a slave.

270
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:02,104
- You won't be when we get to England.
- I'll never get to England.

271
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:05,700
You're like a wounded animal.
You trust no one.

272
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,900
- Good day, my lords.
- Hail, Egbert!

273
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,386
- How's the boat coming along?
- She'll be ready in a week.

274
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,308
Well, she's no sea dragon,
but she'll do for a toy.

275
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,739
Does Einar still bear me a grudge?

276
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,907
You were a fool to anger my son.
He'll kill you one day.

277
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,067
You're not still angry, are you, Einar?

278
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,750
- That depends.
- On what?

279
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,586
On how well you draw maps.

280
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:35,465
See for yourself.
This is a map of Wales.

281
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,708
Wales? That slag heap?
That's not worth one night's raiding.

282
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,425
It holds the richest prize of all:
King Rhodri's daughter, Morgana.

283
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,020
Ha! Rhodri couldn't raise enough
to ransom a Skagerrak moose.

284
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:51,223
No, but Aella could.
He's to marry her in the spring.

285
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,624
Oh?

286
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,541
Einar, I think our Englishman
has a good idea.

287
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,265
She's leaving soon
and must go round this point.

288
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,824
- Here? You're sure?
- I'd stake my life on it.

289
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,418
You already have.

290
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,940
Let me intercept her
and bring her back here.

291
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,425
- How many men would you need?
- One boat.

292
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,302
- Only one boat?
- No more.

293
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,503
What about him without the collar?
Would you take him along?

294
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,382
Well, naturally I'd take along my slave.

295
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,583
You stay here and draw maps.
I'll kidnap the girl.

296
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:35,147
Get him to draw maps that'll guide a ship
through fog - then he'll be worth keeping.

297
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:39,104
- There is no map of any use in fog.
- Then what use are you to us?

298
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:43,746
Think of that while I'm gone. And don't
let anything happen to that slave.

299
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,984
<i>(Kitala)</i> It's a strange metal
that fell to earth from the North Star.

300
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,670
Sandpiper brought it from far away.

301
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,465
The price he paid
was his ears and his tongue.

302
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,947
No matter how you hold it,
it struggles to return homeward

303
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:11,905
to the star from which it fell.
It always points to the north.

304
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:16,467
Not in the fog.
You cannot see the stars in the fog.

305
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,506
Watch.

306
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:30,146
Can it see the star through these walls?

307
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,944
This could lead you to many places.

308
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,985
Even to the land beyond
the poison sea, Valhalla.

309
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,101
You will go there one day.

310
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,108
Only great heroes have ever reached it.

311
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,980
See what the runes say.

312
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,940
Will this take me there?

313
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,786
No.

314
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,903
A woman will point the way.

315
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,860
- What will she look like?
- You will know her when you see her.

316
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,107
- When will that be?
- Soon enough.

317
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,823
Will she love me or hate me?

318
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,307
Love and hate are horns
on the same goat.

319
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,830
What woman would ever look at a slave?

320
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:42,225
This one will.

321
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,146
You're lying, Kitala.

322
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,704
All your tales are lies.

323
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:26,980
Don't look so sad, my lady.
It doesn't become you.

324
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,829
Bridget, how can I marry a man
that I hate?

325
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,181
It's not easy to be a princess,
but you have a duty.

326
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:37,508
This alliance will help your people.
You must marry Aella.

327
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,507
I would rather that I were dead.

328
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,667
The Vikings! Turn back! It's the Vikings!

329
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,583
Quick, my ladies, inside.

330
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:55,020
Steersmen, cut to the wind!
Forecastle men forward!

331
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:08,179
Remember, she's not to be harmed
or she's worthless in trade!

332
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:14,303
All pull at the bowline!

333
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,980
Bend your backs!

334
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:13,185
Oh! No! No!

335
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,986
Bridget!

336
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,670
- My lady!
- No!

337
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,509
- No! No!
- My lady... help!

338
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,579
My lady... <i>(screams)</i>

339
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,381
Bridget! Bridget!

340
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,506
<i>(screaming)</i>

341
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,100
My lady!

342
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,468
- Bridget!
- <i>(screams)</i>

343
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,546
Bridget!

344
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,905
Welcome aboard, my lady.

345
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,782
Aella will kill you for this.

346
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:50,027
Aella? It would be a pity
to send you back to <i>him</i>.

347
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,459
What do you know of Aella?

348
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:57,299
Well, I know he'll pay all the treasure
he's got to get you back.

349
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,670
I'll keep you for myself.

350
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,903
By Odin, she'd make a fine Viking queen.

351
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,019
<i>(laughter)</i>

352
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,947
Get away from me!

353
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:10,107
Hey, now first a little kiss of welcome.

354
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,664
Get away!

355
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,744
- A little kiss of welcome.
- No!

356
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,588
Yes.

357
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,779
<i>(laughter)</i>

358
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:23,506
Remember, she's not to be harmed
or she'll be worthless in trade.

359
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,704
Pretty bird, pretty feathers.
Build her a nest so she can hide.

360
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,630
Too many hawks around here!

361
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,948
- Make sail!
- Make sail.

362
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,786
Einar!

363
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:19,307
<i>(horn continues)</i>

364
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,026
<i>(bells clanking)</i>

365
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,268
Hail, Einar!

366
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:14,783
<i>(crowd)</i>
Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar!

367
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,866
<i>(cheering)</i>

368
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,786
Stop rowing.

369
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,104
Oars down!

370
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,944
- Hail, Einar.
- Hail, Ragnar.

371
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:48,743
I give thanks to Odin
for your safe return.

372
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,668
- Well, where is she?
- Where's who?

373
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,224
Who do you think?
Your friend with the pigtails?!

374
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:58,309
Oh, stop shouting. You sound like
a moose giving birth to a hedgehog.

375
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,024
- Einar!
- Get this grain ashore.

376
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:03,869
I wanna know why you missed
the wench you were sent for.

377
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,187
- I didn't miss her.
- Where is she?

378
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,746
Ah...

379
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:20,704
A little skinny, perhaps,
but not bad. Not bad at all.

380
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:22,661
Restrain yourself, my lord.

381
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:27,227
If she is dishonoured, she'll be worthless
as a queen and Aella won't ransom her.

382
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:31,821
- I don't need traitors to plead my cause.
- My quarrel is with Aella, lady, not you.

383
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,418
We agreed you would be unharmed.

384
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:38,225
- Remember that, Einar. Leave her alone.
- I haven't touched her... yet.

385
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,910
And you never will.
I'd kill myself first.

386
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:45,941
- Ah. She doesn't seem to like you.
- She likes me well enough.

387
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,379
I doubt it, from the looks of her.

388
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,580
So do I.

389
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:55,505
- But the time will come.
- Never.

390
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,586
Never?

391
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:03,022
You like the scars on my face,
don't you, hm?

392
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:07,666
Sure, my beauty stirs her little heart.

393
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:22,463
You have better luck with falcons. She'll
never call <i>you</i> dainty-face! <i>(laughs)</i>

394
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,787
Any objections?

395
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,344
Of course not, my lord.
He's just a slave.

396
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,780
- Let's go ashore and take her along.
- She stays here.

397
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:47,181
We'll talk about her again,
when you're more drunk or more sober.

398
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:52,907
Olaf! Anchor the boat out on the fjord.
And guard her well.

399
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:04,345
<i>(cheering)</i>

400
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:25,507
Ah, come. You'll soon forget the wench.

401
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:29,100
- She's too skinny anyhow.
- She's beautiful.

402
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:35,703
Ah, all those bones sticking out, she's an
old crow with all the feathers pulled out.

403
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,469
She said she'd kill herself
if I touched her.

404
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:43,539
They all say that. What they really mean
is they'll kill themselves if you <i>don't</i>.

405
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,948
Maybe, but I've never had one
spit on me and bite me.

406
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:52,985
Huh! They'll bite all the more
now that you're Einar One-Eye.

407
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:56,989
I wanted to thank you
for proving me innocent.

408
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,340
Go back to your husband.

409
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:10,625
Come. Drink.
No one woman is worth all this fuss.

410
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:37,820
Well, my lady,
as terrible as this captivity is,

411
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:42,341
at least we should be thankful
that so far our honour has been spared.

412
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:45,303
Yes, Bridget,
we have that to be thankful for.

413
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:49,389
Strange how things never
turn out the way you expect.

414
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:53,219
I always thought Vikings
attacked their women.

415
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,102
We've been very lucky.

416
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:57,903
It hasn't been due
entirely to luck, Bridget.

417
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:01,784
He can't help the way he acts.
He's a pagan, my lady.

418
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:05,186
- He's a mad dog.
- Well...

419
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:09,383
If it weren't for the scars on his face,
he'd be rather nice looking.

420
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,978
Oh, for a Viking, I mean.

421
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,624
I don't want to talk about him.

422
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:20,105
Scratches and bites
won't hold him off for ever.

423
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:37,781
What a son!

424
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:44,348
How about my mother?

425
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:47,064
Tell me, did my mother fight you?

426
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:52,542
Ah, did she fight me.

427
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:57,221
I have the scars of her scratches
and bites all over me.

428
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:00,183
Ha! What a woman.

429
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:05,344
That's how I feel about Morgana.

430
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:08,862
Look at me.

431
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:13,142
Do you think with this face I want
the kind of wife who'd <i>let</i> me touch her?

432
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:19,823
I want her to fight me tooth and nail,
the first time I take her and the last.

433
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,506
You are my son.

434
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:31,220
And you'll be wearing this one day.
Don't forget that.

435
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:33,466
I won't forget it.

436
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:46,788
Now... if you really want her,
as skinny as she is, I give her to you.

437
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:49,822
Wait a minute. What do you mean, you...

438
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:55,749
- You mean we won't ransom her?
- No! You can have her.

439
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:04,463
Oh, I'll give this little wench from
Wales a reason to bite and scratch.

440
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:12,102
I'm Einar!

441
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,346
Son of Ragnar!

442
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:19,988
I'll show her what forging can be done
when fire fights fire!

443
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:24,501
I'll make her howl
till they hear her in Wales!

444
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,107
<i>(crowd singing)</i>

445
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:51,699
Morgana!

446
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:56,703
My pretty little bird,
sharpen your claws!

447
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:58,786
<i>(laughs)</i>

448
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:01,939
I'm Einar!

449
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:09,703
All right, men! Everybody off!

450
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:13,027
Morgana and I wanna be alone.

451
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:15,505
Good job, mate!

452
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,949
Agh... Olaf!

453
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:23,624
Thank you, Olaf!

454
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:27,379
Morgana! Out! Out!

455
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:31,264
- We don't need you.
- I can't swim!

456
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:41,543
If you touch me, I'll kill myself.

457
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:46,302
There's a sword to do it with...

458
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:48,500
because I'm going to touch you.

459
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:55,541
Scratch.

460
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,739
Come on.

461
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,668
- Fight!
- A woman can't fight a man.

462
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:07,419
You wench! Kick, bite, scratch!

463
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:11,026
Now come on.

464
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,866
Fight me.

465
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:18,659
I will not lift one finger to resist you.

466
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,540
Whatever you do
will be on your conscience.

467
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:37,581
Then let it be on my conscience.

468
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,986
- I've come to help you escape.
- Escape?

469
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:52,819
- I've stolen a ship.
- My lady, it's a tiny boat. We'll drown.

470
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:54,542
- Are you afraid?
- Yes.

471
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,104
- Will you come with me?
- Yes.

472
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,790
My lady, how do you know
you can trust this slave?

473
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:03,107
I know. If you don't want
to come, you can stay.

474
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:05,460
Wait. Wait for me.

475
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:41,462
Our only chance
is to get far away by morning.

476
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:43,785
Yes, I can see that.

477
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:48,587
We'd go a lot faster if we all rowed.

478
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:50,860
Would we?

479
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:53,424
Yes, we would.

480
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,620
Do you mean that I should row this boat?

481
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,900
Yes, I do mean that.

482
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,226
Impossible.

483
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:05,865
- Get an oar and row.
- But a princess doesn't row a boat.

484
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:11,348
- Get an oar and row.
- But I can't. I don't know how.

485
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:19,620
Learn. You too.

486
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,503
Oh!

487
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:42,786
- What's the matter now?
- This bodice is too tight. I'll have to stop.

488
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,629
- What's a bodice?
- This dress I'm wearing.

489
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,742
It's too tight right in there... Oh!

490
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:53,266
- Row.
- Mine isn't too tight.

491
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,264
Eric, look!

492
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:54,987
It's Einar. Turn! Turn!

493
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:42,826
- They are heading for the fog.
- We'll get them!

494
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:48,380
- We can't go into the fog.
- Keep rowing.

495
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:38,426
Faster! Faster!

496
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,384
The men are afraid
we'll run aground. So am I.

497
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,819
Keep rowing!

498
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:49,387
Faster! Faster!

499
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,221
Look out!

500
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,780
Grab hold of the mast.

501
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:12,662
Stop rowing.

502
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:17,019
Odin! Odin!

503
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,899
I'm going under!

504
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:24,906
Hold on!

505
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,740
Lift me out.

506
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:25,259
Oh!

507
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,106
Over here!

508
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,098
Over here!

509
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:42,305
<i>(Einar)</i> Back to your oars!

510
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:45,585
- Back to your oars!
- Give up the chase.

511
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:48,224
Morgana's out there! After them!

512
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:53,140
The Great Snake is sunk.
You want to wreck this ship too?

513
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:55,022
Ragnar.

514
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:58,028
Ragnar! Ragnar!

515
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:03,708
- Where's Ragnar?
- At the bottom of the fjord.

516
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:11,386
The curse of Odin on that slave!

517
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:19,062
If I have to cross the poison sea,
I'll find him.

518
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:24,389
I swear it...
by the sacred blood of Odin.

519
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:55,140
Still afraid?

520
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:59,786
No. I'm worth more alive
than dead. Are you?

521
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:03,789
No. But I value my life much more now.

522
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:12,146
Of course, I'm grateful to you for saving
me and Aella will certainly reward you...

523
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:14,704
- Why should I take you back to Aella?
- But you must.

524
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,548
Why?

525
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:20,461
I'm pledged to him on my father's word.

526
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:24,825
I didn't steal you away
just to give you to another man.

527
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:30,139
Aella isn't another man. He's a king.

528
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:32,626
And I'm a slave.

529
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:37,022
And I loved you the moment I saw you.

530
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:41,230
I loved you even before then.

531
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:45,179
Kitala saw it in the runes.

532
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:52,947
That's just Kitala's silly talk.

533
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:59,420
Do you love Aella?

534
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:09,263
I belong to him...
by my father's word as a Christian king.

535
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:13,824
What's your father's word
compared to Odin's will?

536
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:19,147
Do you know which of all the oceans
is the widest?

537
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:21,830
The poison sea.

538
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:25,107
No.

539
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:28,188
The ocean between
a Christian and a heathen.

540
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:33,586
Our hands can reach across it
as easily as that.

541
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:35,940
But that's just a joining of the flesh.

542
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:41,100
- What else is missing?
- The joining of our souls.

543
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:44,461
If our hands are touching,
our souls must be touching.

544
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,899
But your soul is heathen.

545
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:52,784
If my soul is content to be heathen
and yours content to be Christian,

546
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:56,903
let's not question flesh
for wanting to remain flesh.

547
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,866
Kitala.

548
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:26,665
We'll be in England soon.

549
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:42,227
Suppose Aella releases you
from your pledge.

550
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:45,904
Then I'd be free.

551
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:47,986
But why should he?

552
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,980
I'll find a way.

553
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:55,708
How can I make you understand?

554
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:02,141
What would be the worst thing
for a Viking?

555
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:10,026
To die without a sword in his hand
and never enter Valhalla.

556
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:14,223
For me to break my pledge to Aella
would be as bad as that.

557
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:35,900
I'll find a way.

558
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:49,019
You captured Ragnar single-handed?

559
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:52,306
We all owe you our thanks.

560
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:55,547
I don't want your thanks. I want Morgana.

561
01:06:56,910 --> 01:07:01,426
This barbarian is under the illusion you
desire to be released from your pledge.

562
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,620
Do you release me?

563
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:06,742
Surely you don't want to be released?

564
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:09,020
- Yes, I do.
- That is absurd.

565
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,584
- Sire, you gave your word.
- Of course.

566
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,905
But first things first.

567
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,864
Father Godwin, take the
Princess Morgana to the chapel,

568
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:21,744
that she may meditate
before making a final decision.

569
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:24,866
Yes, sire.

570
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:37,543
Well, gentlemen,
let us proceed to the kennels.

571
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:39,945
The royal pets are hungry.

572
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:42,026
Take him.

573
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:17,664
That stone, my lady...

574
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:23,543
- Where did you get it?
- Eric gave it to me.

575
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,422
Where did he get it?

576
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:30,385
He said it was tied around his neck
when the Vikings captured him as a baby.

577
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:33,666
<i>(wolves barking)</i>

578
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:15,940
Since you brought him here,
the pleasure shall be yours.

579
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:19,066
Push him in.

580
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:37,062
I claim the right of a Viking
to die with a sword in my hand.

581
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:39,784
And I deny you that right.

582
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:42,982
Go ahead. Push him in.

583
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:48,463
Cut my bonds and give me the sword.

584
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,740
Why should I?

585
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:55,544
Would you deny me
the right to enter Valhalla?

586
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:18,785
What are you doing?

587
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:34,700
You dare give him that sword?

588
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:50,106
<i>(yells)</i>

589
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:53,027
<i>(laughs)</i>

590
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:57,983
Odin!

591
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:00,066
<i>(wolves snarl)</i>

592
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:17,421
And Einar is his brother.

593
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:20,860
And Eric has surrendered
his own father to Aella.

594
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:24,187
Oh, Father Godwin,
we must try to stop him.

595
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:26,983
Yes. Come.

596
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,782
You have dared to defy a king.

597
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:36,504
You shall join Ragnar in the pit.

598
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:40,143
I want all here to see the reward
for such defiance.

599
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:42,830
Your Majesty,
I would ask you to bear in mind

600
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:47,580
that I made good your promise
in the name of Holy Mother Church.

601
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:57,827
Thank you, Father Godwin.
You are the watchdog of my fury.

602
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:00,944
But if a common slave
can rob me of a queen

603
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:04,187
and slay an enemy too cunning
for a whole nation to defeat,

604
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:09,020
then the day must come when he will be
a deadlier foe than Ragnar ever was.

605
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:13,541
With or without God's sanction,
I tell you as your king this cannot be.

606
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:16,707
- Aella...
- Yes, my dear?

607
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:20,823
I will keep my pledge to you.
Don't kill him.

608
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:32,619
In that case, nothing could distress me
more than for you to think me cruel.

609
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,866
Then let him go.

610
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:45,338
Hold out the hand that has defied me.

611
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,066
<i>(groans)</i>

612
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:19,459
Let this serve as a lesson
to all Vikings.

613
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:22,468
Take him to his ship and cast him adrift.

614
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:26,062
Eric!

615
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:30,380
Why do we wait?

616
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:36,989
Because of a slave, my father's bones
lie now at the bottom of the fjord.

617
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:44,146
Ragnar was your king.
But he had no Viking's burial.

618
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:51,069
I have sworn by the blood of Odin
to avenge my father's death.

619
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:56,747
Why do we wait?

620
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:58,940
We must mourn Ragnar.

621
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:02,342
It's revenge Ragnar wants, not mourning.

622
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:06,465
Every Viking wants to revenge
the death of Ragnar.

623
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:09,184
Then let's go to England now
for the girl and the slave.

624
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:11,346
We don't even know where they are.

625
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:15,668
Where would the slave go but to Aella's
castle to be rewarded for his treachery?

626
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:18,862
Perhaps, but what chance
would we have?

627
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:21,902
Aella's castle is the strongest
in all of England.

628
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:25,181
I know Aella's castle well.
Here are the maps.

629
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:27,744
Einar has studied every stone and beam.

630
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:30,623
To reach the castle,
we'll have to hug the English coast.

631
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:33,662
They will have days
to prepare for our attack.

632
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:40,388
We don't hug the coast.
We sail across the open sea.

633
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:45,106
- And if there's fog?
- Can't we do what a slave did?

634
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:48,702
The slave used witchcraft.

635
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:52,789
His eyes saw through the fog
to the stars.

636
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:56,341
Are you afraid, Bjorn?

637
01:14:56,830 --> 01:15:00,379
Do not confuse fear for caution.

638
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:03,502
Odin has sent no sign.

639
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:08,182
Then you can stay here.

640
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:13,782
But we go to avenge Ragnar's death.
Who sails with me?

641
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:39,061
Not even enough to man one ship.

642
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:15,500
Odin.

643
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:19,220
Odin.

644
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:31,423
Odin must have answered me.

645
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:37,021
- Where's Morgana?
- In Aella's castle.

646
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:39,584
You dare to come back here
just to tell me this?

647
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:42,270
No. I need you and your men
to take the castle,

648
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:45,382
and you need me to guide you
across the open sea.

649
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:47,865
Why should you want me
to free Morgana?

650
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:51,108
Because she shall be my wife.

651
01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:57,460
All right, slave...

652
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:01,343
you live until Morgana's free.

653
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:05,827
Vikings! Vikings!

654
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:08,987
- Odin <i>has</i> sent us a sign.
- Kill him!

655
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:15,899
Listen to me!

656
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:21,229
Make no mistake, I hate this slave
more than any living man.

657
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:23,306
But he can guide us to Morgana.

658
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:29,699
What matters more to you, a foreign
wench or vengeance for Ragnar?

659
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:37,503
Because of him, your father lies
at the bottom of the fjord.

660
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:41,384
That's not true! Ragnar died in England!

661
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:43,865
<i>(murmuring, then hush)</i>

662
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:51,385
In the fog he swam to my boat.
I took him there.

663
01:17:57,870 --> 01:17:59,861
How did Ragnar die?

664
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:05,389
Aella ordered him bound
and thrown alive into the wolf pit.

665
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:10,944
Ragnar, bound like a sheep
and thrown to wolves?

666
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:13,505
I cut his bonds.

667
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:16,508
He died fighting
with the sword I gave him.

668
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:22,068
And this was my thanks from Aella
for letting Ragnar die like a Viking.

669
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:35,264
Now you know how Ragnar died.

670
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:38,345
His eyes can lead us to Aella.

671
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:40,426
Now!

672
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:43,781
Who sails with me?

673
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:45,628
- I will!
- I will!

674
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:49,182
Hail, Einar!

675
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:55,146
Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar! Hail, Einar!

676
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:57,226
<i>(horn)</i>

677
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:02,907
Strange, isn't it?

678
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:07,103
I was going to take you to England
and now you're taking me.

679
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:13,426
Do you still have that stone
you wear about your neck?

680
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:15,825
No, it's gone.

681
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:19,829
Oh. Just as well.

682
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:21,906
Why?

683
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:25,110
I used to think it would bring me luck.

684
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:29,303
Now neither of us
will have any use for it.

685
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:54,422
<i>(horn call)</i>

686
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:28,864
The Vikings!

687
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:43,458
It's the Vikings!

688
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:58,785
The Vikings!

689
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:07,708
Egbert, where would Morgana be?

690
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:12,300
The safest place is the tower chapel.

691
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:38,426
Odin!

692
01:32:35,230 --> 01:32:37,790
<i>(cheering)</i>

693
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:49,858
Be assured, sire, the second drawbridge
is much stronger than the first.

694

<i>(yells)</i>

Odin!

697
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:36,426
<i>(wolves growling)</i>

698
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:52,462

01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:09,347
<i>(shouting outside)</i>

701
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:35,543
Take your magic elsewhere, holy man.

702
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:39,463
This chapel is a sanctuary.

703
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:43,902
Father Godwin!

704
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:10,780
Go ahead, jump.

705
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:35,099
You will be my queen.

706
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:40,786
I knew it the first moment I saw you.

707
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:46,186
You knew it too.
You knew it that night on my ship.

708
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:50,629
- It's not true.
- Yes.

709
01:41:52,590 --> 01:41:54,546
It is true.

710
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:57,500
I don't love you.

711
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:03,946
You must love me exactly as I love you.

712
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:10,188
I hate you! It's Eric I love.

713
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:41,620
- Where are you taking me?
- To see Eric... for the last time.

714
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:44,787
Don't kill him. You can't.

715
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:48,266
Look at this. It's from the pommel
of the sword Requitur.

716
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:51,826
It was given to Eric by his mother,
Enid the queen.

717
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:55,260
Oh, listen to me! Ragnar was his father!

718
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:57,585
Lies won't save him!

719
01:42:57,710 --> 01:43:00,383
It's true. I swear it is.

720
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:02,705
He is your brother!

721
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:06,339
Eric!

722
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:25,060
Look at him,
how he hastens to his death.

723
01:43:25,190 --> 01:43:27,260
He can't wait to die.

724
01:43:33,230 --> 01:43:37,189
If I can't have your love,
I'll take your hate.

Odin!

Prepare a funeral for a Viking.
