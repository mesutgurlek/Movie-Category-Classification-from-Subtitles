00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:35,740
As you breathe and focus,
you're gonna learn to control them.

317
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,682
- OK. OK.
- Just like you're doing, right now.

318
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,050
- [Panting]
- OK?

319
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,414
How do your hands feel?

320
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:49,584
- [Chuckles] Better.
- Good.

321
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,953
So, what now?

322
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,155
Now?

323
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,396
We wait. You're gonna keep
growing stronger and faster.

324
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,165
I need you to be careful.

325
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,299
Right now, you have to focus
your mind. Get some control.

326
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,467
When you can do that,
you can get back to school.

327
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:08,137
I don't want to raise suspicion.
I still have business here.

328
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,044
In the meantime, your powers
will only draw attention.

329
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,413
You keep yourself in check,
you understand?

330
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,044
So I got all these powers,
but I'm not allowed to use them?

331
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,280
Exactly.

332
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,385
[Door slamming]

333
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,172

[Indistinct chatter]

340
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,638
- A little early for Thanksgiving.
- [Scanner beeping]

341
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,269
Paper or plastic?

342
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,939
[Grunting]

343
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,264
[Inhaling deeply] Whoa.

344
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:49,239
- [Heavy banging]
- [Creature snarling]

[Growling]

[Roaring]

347
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:09,752
And you wind it here...

348
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,160
[indistinct chatter]

349
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,309
"Strangers in Paradise"?

350
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,445
I know. Arty, pretentious.

351
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:38,682
Uh... That's not actually
what I was gonna say.

352
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:42,055
I just needed a name for my website
and it was right there.

353
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:48,129
You know, they should've
called this town "Ironic."

354
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,192
Ironic, Ohio?
Has a ring to it.

355
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:57,397
What's up with you?
You look different, or something.

356
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,340
Sarah, come over!
I got a new bike!

357
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,005
- [Chuckles] OK, I will next week.
- [Kids giggling]

358
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,378
- Hold this for a second.
- All right.

359
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,508
- Oh, they're so cute.
- [Kids chattering]

360
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,677
You know, uh... I mean it.

361
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,312
Uh... Your photographs...

362
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,846
My parents make me babysit
for film money,

363
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:17,054
and those are two of my victims.
[Giggling]

364
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,528
You know, I'm, uh...

365
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,998
I'm actually trying to
pay you a compliment, but, uh...

366
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,433
...it's not going so well.

367
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,060
Oh.

368
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,037
Right. Um...

369
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,370
Thank you.

370
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:38,714
I don't know, I just, um,
see better through this thing.

371
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,679
It's like my own
personal BS detector.

372

- [Clicking]
- [Horn honking]

373
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,218
[Man] Come on! Let's go!

374
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:53,229
Excuse me. Did you forget something?
You had two things to do, you know?

375
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,458
- Lock the door and turn off the lights!
- [John] That's Sam's dad?

376
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,591
His stepdad.

377
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,693
Every night
it's the same thing with you!

378
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,268
[Camera winding, clicks]

379
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,476
This is it.

380
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,470
[Chuckles]

381
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,348
You live here?

382
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,022
Yeah, I grew up here.

383
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:28,023
- It's just a house.
- I know.

384
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,432
[Chuckles]

385
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,932
You hungry?

386
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:38,305
So, John, just moved
from Santa Fe a few weeks ago.

387
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,968
- The Smiths, right?
- Uh, yes, sir.

388
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:43,104
- And your father's a writer?
- Yes, he is.

389
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:45,843
Everybody really does know everything
in this town.

390
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,442
[Chuckles]
Oh, gossip spreads like Ebola.

391
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:49,783
- Question game!
- [Phone ringing]

392
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,119
- Oh! Sorry, my bad.
- [Sighing]

393
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,283
- All right, everybody, surrender them.
- Here you go.

394
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,657
All electronic devices.
Come on, Sarah. Thank you.

395
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:58,854
[Father] Hand them over.

396
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,727
- And you.
- [Sarah] Mom?

397
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,733
He'll get it back after dinner.
You'll get it back after dinner.

398
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,328
- Thank you, John. See? It's fine.
- All right.

399
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:10,738
So, Santa Fe's kind of hip, right?
You bored silly here?

400
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,437
Nah, not with the spring carnival
coming up!

401
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,413
It's fun, and you and your folks
should definitely come.

402
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,745
Oh, it's just me and my dad.

403
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,808
Where's your mom?

404
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,444
- Uh... My...
- Mom.

405
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:26,981
No, it's fine. My dad and mom,
uh, they didn't get married.

406
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,959
Uh, you know, check it out.
Carnival.

407
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,360
Sarah will be there
taking pictures for the paper.

408
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,522
Cheap labor.

409
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:35,190
- [Mother] That is not why.
- No.

410
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,030
- She's a very talented photographer.
- [Boy] Question game!

411
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:41,162
OK. Keep your voice down,
and we will play.

412
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:44,902
It's a dinner tradition. Otherwise,
we'd never talk about the good stuff.

413
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,341
Worst advice you ever got?

414
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,642
"Pull this."

415
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,907
- [All chuckling]
- [Mother] Oh, stop!

416
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,573
- That's really gross.
- [Laughter]

417
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,843
OK, um...

418
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,148
"Your parents will never know
you're gone."

419
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,211
It worked with your folks.
That's how she got here.

420
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,778
- Stop it. Stop.
- Oh, my God.

421
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,791
- [Father] What?
- [Mother] OK, Sarah, your turn.

422
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:05,591
Oh. Mom telling me that self-tanner
looks totally natural.

423
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,858
- [Laughing]
- She was orange.

424
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,367
Like a traffic cone.
On picture day.

425
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,924
Oh, you should go get that picture.

426
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,231
- We still have the picture!
- John, you are gonna...

427
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,033
Why would you want
to show him that?

428
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,370
- I shouldn't have said it.
- [Overlapping chatter]

429
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,534
[Sarah] I think I tore them up.

430
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,602
[Chatter continues]

431
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,280
Sorry about that.

432
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:32,513
- About what?
- My parents.

433
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:36,015
They were putting on the
"aren't we cool?" show.

434
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,721
They seem very proud of you.

435
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,729
Yeah, and they're already
trying to convince me

436
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,095
to go to the local community college
in Dayton.

437
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,226
They'd love it if I stayed here.

438
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,397
Got into wedding photography.

439
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:51,441
- What do you want to do?
- [Camera winding]

440
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,840
[Clicking]

441
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,377
That's my favorite.

442
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,939
It's got all these light leaks

443
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,076
so the photos come out so interesting.

444
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,950
Here, I'll show you.

445
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,992
See that one right there?

446
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,968
That's what I was talking about.

447
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,333
What's this?

448
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,199
Um...

449
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:32,211
That is kind of private, actually.

450
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,881
It's amazing.

451
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,350
[Nervous chuckle]

452
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,027
- What?
- [Chuckles] You...

453
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,788
You're allowed
to look at everyone else...

454
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:52,131
...take our pictures, but, uh...
we're not allowed to see you?

455
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,971
OK. [chuckles]
That's enough.

456
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:05,946
Seems like you want to run away.

457
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,008
I'll just be happy
when I can get out of here.

458
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,814
I don't know.
I've been to a lot of places.

459
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,355
You don't have to give me the
"there's no place like home" speech.

460
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,981
- [Laughs]
- I've heard it.

461
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:17,654
No, no. You can go wherever you want,
see whatever you want to.

462
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:22,064
But a place is only as good
as the people you know in it.

463
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,732
I, uh...

464
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,742
I think this is a pretty good place.

465
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,747
[Bernie barking]

466
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,878
[Clearing throat]

[Barking continues]

468
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,296
[Whispers] Bernie, you dumb dog.

469
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,058
- Does he belong to you?
- Yeah. I gotta go.

470
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:00,763
Well, hey. Hold on a sec.

471
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:05,670
Um...

472
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,781
Your turn.

473
