yeah, midfielder.

166
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,453
I hurt my knee, and they still
wanted to sign me, but--

We need to keep moving.
I don't want to lose the light.

I don't trust your plan.

Well, I don't remember
asking you to.

Yeah, which already saved
your life once.

Uh-huh, yeah,
I realize your boss requires

00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:11,852
a blind allegiance
and slavish devotion, okay?

182

We don't have time for this.

that your agency's in league

who are trying to kill me.

You're like a dog with a bone.

And I know
that I'm absolutely right.

- Absolutely.

Now, please.

To where?

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,736
I'm gonna take you to
a safe location in Buenos Aires.

00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:30,270
- Oh, okay.
- Once there, I check in.

193
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:32,406
If everything's okay, I'll take
you to the Italian embassy.

Hey, hey, no.

you owed me, sir,

but a promotion?

204
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:57,802
This would be a substantial
change in your life--

00:09:57,869 --> 00:10:00,471
a staff, your own office
on the seventh floor.

Whoa. A view.

A bump in grade means
a bump in pay--

all of five hours

offered up a trade.

No.

in the country for five days
