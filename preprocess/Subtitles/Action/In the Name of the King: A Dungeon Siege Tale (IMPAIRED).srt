1
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:45,371
I knew you'd come.

2
00:00:45,372 --> 00:00:48,077
I told you I would.

3
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:51,549
I mean, I... I felt it.

4
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,864
I felt it before you came.

5
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,366
( man )
you're developing your powers, Muriella.

6
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,809
Our time together is paying off.

7
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,212
( Wind Whistling )

8
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:26,869
Stop.

9
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,211
You have to leave.

10
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:32,130
Is that your wish?

11
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:35,349
Each time we meet like this, I feel...

12
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:39,364
Weak. I feel drained.

13
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,736
( Whispering )
Perhaps that is what love does to a woman.

14
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:46,564
What do you know of love?

15
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:49,478
I know that poets claim
they would die for it.

16
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,454
- Would you die for it?
- Perhaps.

17
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:54,469
- In a poem.
- ( Laughs )

18
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,447
- ( Chuckles )
- What would my father say?

19
00:01:57,448 --> 00:02:01,670
There are many things in this world
your father doesn't know.

20
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:04,712
Let this be one of them.

21
00:02:04,713 --> 00:02:09,621
Sacrilege. This is madness, Gallian.
you go too far.

22
00:02:13,257 --> 00:02:15,995
( People moaning, Screaming )

23
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,723

( Indistinct Voices )

25
00:02:30,413 --> 00:02:32,460
Keep pulling, Zeph.

26
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:34,816
Use your legs.

27
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:38,861
( Zeph )
It doesn't want to come out.

28
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:43,086
- ( Grunts )
- It's those big ones that are always the toughest.

- ( Grunts )
- ( Chuckles )

See? Things worthwhile
don't come easy.

( Cawing )

32

( Squawking )

33
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:03,931
You missed.

34
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:06,417
I don't want to kill them...

35
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:08,892
As long as they don't eat the crops.

36

( Pig Squealing )

37
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,932
Brought the hog.
Same deal as always?

38
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,820
Winter's corn for the pig?

39
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:31,221
Same deal. Deal never changes.

40
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:33,941
It's been a tough
dry season, hasn't it?

41
00:03:33,942 --> 00:03:37,046
- I've seen rougher.
- King's recruiting.

42
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:39,607
Soldiers get taken care of really well.

43
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:43,127
I have this land.
Isn't that enough?

44
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:46,945
you get older, you get tired
of just surviving.

45
00:03:47,832 --> 00:03:50,552
Wouldn't you like
to test your courage?

46
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:53,912
I mean, where's the courage
in just surviving?

47
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:57,401
Damn it, Farmer, would it kill you
to just talk for a little while?

48
00:03:57,402 --> 00:04:01,177
I mean, we're not animals.
People actually do converse with one another.

49
00:04:01,178 --> 00:04:03,770
Norick, if I could talk these turnips
out of the ground, I would.

50
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:07,547
When the rains come,
this ground turns to clay.

51
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:10,586
Not even you could talk 'em
out of the ground then.

52
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:13,853
That's what I love
about your old man, Zeph.

53
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:15,740
He always knows how to set a mood.

54
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:18,716
- Show Norick where we stack his corn.
- Okay.

55
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,957
Here you go, Zeph. Have a pig.

56
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,368
- ( Laughing )
- ( Squealing )

57
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,405
( Farmer)
Guess you'll be staying for supper.

58
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:32,046
Well, since you asked.

59
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:43,296
Norick, it is so good to see you.
You should come by more often.

60
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:46,274
Well, I figure Farmer saw enough of me
when he was growing up.

61
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:50,304
Now that he's got a family of his own,
maybe he needs a little bit of a break.

62
00:04:50,305 --> 00:04:52,546
Norick thinks Father should quit farming
and join the king's army.

63
00:04:52,547 --> 00:04:56,226
- ( Gasps )
- Now hold on a second. I didn't say that exactly.

64
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:58,819
He says the king's soldiers
make a lot of money.

65
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,348
Farmer, you're not seriously
considering this, are you?

66
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:04,163
You're my family.
I'm not going anywhere.

67
00:05:04,164 --> 00:05:07,300
- That answer your question, Norick?
- I was just talking.

68
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:09,860
- Just talking.
- Well, everyone's got a talent.

69
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:13,605
- Just talking seems to be yours.
- ( Zeph, Woman Laugh )

70
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:16,741
Just ratting on his friends
seems to be yours.

71
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:18,789
- Can I have some chicken, please?
- Don't give it to him.

72
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,139
- Give me the chicken. Har, har, har.
- ( Zeph Laughs )

73
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:41,481
Tell me something nice.

74
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:43,402
Tell me how you love me.

75
00:05:43,403 --> 00:05:46,075
You know.

76
00:05:46,603 --> 00:05:48,842
( Laughs, Sighs )

77
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:50,763
I only know what you tell me...

78
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:52,811
and you tell me nothing.

79
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:56,956
Look at these hands-
Broken to feed us.

80
00:05:57,805 --> 00:06:00,492
These hands speak louder than words.

81
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,743
What is the cost of telling me?

82
00:06:04,622 --> 00:06:07,032
What more could you want?

83
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:09,997
What every woman wants...

84
00:06:09,998 --> 00:06:11,918
A little passion.

85
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,767
- A little passion?
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:06:14,768 --> 00:06:19,010
Well, let me see what I can do.

87
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:25,392
- ( Woman ) It's time to go.
- ( Zeph ) Why can't you come with us?

88
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:27,857
( Farmer)
I have all those fields to clear.

89
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:31,249
Remember... When men build lives
from honest toil...

90
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,841
- Courage never fails.
- ( Laughs )

91
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:36,285
That's right.

92
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,103
I hate sleeping without you.

93
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,973
Be safe.

94
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:59,752
It's Stonebridge.
Of course we'll be safe.

95
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,928
( Zeph )
Why do people call Father Farmer?

96
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:14,039
Doesn't he have a name?

97
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,344
Your father believes that people
become what they do.

98
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:19,097
Norick brought him to Stonebridge
when he was just little.

99
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:21,113
So Norick is his father?

100
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:23,162
The whole town adopted him.

101
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:25,785
Different families took him
at different times.

102
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:28,185
But Norick- He always kept
a special eye out.

103
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:30,267
I'm glad he has a family now.

104
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:32,655
I'm glad it's us.

105
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:35,803
Mmm!

106
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:38,759
Mmm. So am I.

107
00:07:57,887 --> 00:08:00,492
General.

108
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:04,224
Report to your king.

109
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:06,208
Your Majesty, Krug...

110
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:08,897
Savage army. The Krug...

111
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:10,594
They-They fight with swords.

112
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:14,850
This is ridiculous. It's as if
you were talking about armed dogs.

113
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:19,138
They fight like men.
They killed off our entire scouting party.

114
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,087
Had the general not ordered me to return
with word, I should be dead as well.

115
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:28,082
This is some sort of sorcery.

116

Zeph, is that you?

00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:23,798
( Laughs )
I've got you.

125
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,717
Finally! Into the oven with you.

126

- ( Laughs )
- I hate the oven.

127

It's dry, it's warm.

128
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:32,726
You don't want us
to eat you raw, now, do you?

129
00:10:32,727 --> 00:10:34,648
Why do you have to eat me?

130
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,601
Tonight, I promised your grandfather...

131
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,968
we're going to eat a dish he really loves.

132

( muttering )

134

- So, how were sales at the market?
- It was good.

135
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:01,595
Of course, the men tried to take
advantage of me because I'm a woman...

136
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:05,372
so I make them pay more...
because I'm a woman.

137
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,644
- ( Laughing )
- When we were kids you were always in charge.

138
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:10,813
- Always the leader.
- No, I just knew what I wanted, that's all.

139
00:11:10,814 --> 00:11:12,604
Until she met your father.

140
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,855
Your father does not take orders
very well from anybody.

( Grunting )

142

- Where's Grandfather?
- The bell tower.

- Shall we go?
- We have to be careful.

144
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,666
The bell tower was made
for times of war.

Hah!

149
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:39,935
What took you so long?

- Aaah!
- Aaah!

154
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,953
( Norick )
This is crazy.

155
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:27,097
Krug are beasts.
They don't have armor and weapons.

156
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,016
I need to use your horse, Norick.

157

- Where are you going?
- Stonebridge.

- Solana and Zeph are there.
- I'm coming with you.

No. My husband likes to leave
the trade to me so that he can farm.

161
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:40,891
You did well for a husband.

162
00:13:40,892 --> 00:13:42,812
He loves you very much.

163
00:13:42,813 --> 00:13:47,484
Yes. Yes. I believe he does.

164
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:50,813
( man ) When the bride and groom kiss,
ring the bell five times...

165
00:13:50,814 --> 00:13:53,757
signaling their marriage
for the village to hear.

166
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:56,253
( Grunting )

167
00:13:56,254 --> 00:14:00,552
Go. Go now. Take Zeph home now.

168
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:05,491
Take him! You can protect him, Father.
Protect him.

169
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:09,873
( Bell Clanging )

170
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:20,097
( Laughs )

171
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:22,019
- Are you ready, my lady?
- Always ready.

172
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,073
( Grunting )

173
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:28,580
Hold.

174
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,935
Giving up so soon?

175
00:14:31,845 --> 00:14:34,865
Your progress is truly remarkable.

176
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,790
If only Ehb had more soldiers
of your caliber.

177
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,712
- Let me join your army and you shall.
- ( Grunts )

178
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:46,565
( Both Laughing )

179
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:50,120
I am not quite sure that the armies of Ehb
are ready for women warriors.

180
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:54,265
Besides, what would your father say?

181
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,447
( Grunts )

182
00:14:57,448 --> 00:15:00,040
My father never lets me do
anything I want.

183
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,024
( man )
Tarish.!

184
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:04,329
Prepare your troops to ride.

185
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,593
Hordes of Krug are ransacking the land.

186
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:10,154
Oh, the sun is blistering my skin.

187
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:13,471
What is this nonsense you speak?

188
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:17,258
Just do as you're commanded.

189
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:19,468
I listen only to the king.

190
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:21,580
It might behoove you...

191
00:15:21,581 --> 00:15:25,146
to learn a little respect.

192
00:15:26,861 --> 00:15:29,533
Respect is earned.

193
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:33,628
You are mistaken.
Respect is my birthright!

194
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:38,556
( Clamoring )

195
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:42,272
( Shouting, Screaming )

196
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,211
- ( Screams )

197
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:38,280
( Grunting )

198
00:16:57,403 --> 00:17:00,359
( Clanging Continues )

199
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:06,479
( Snarling )

200
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:10,205
- ( Gasps )
- ( Snarls )

201
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:11,965
( Grunting )

202
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:15,116
( Man )
To the village, everyone!

203
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,280
- Where's Solana?
- She's-She's sounding the bell.

204
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:25,758
Don't worry, Zeph. I'll find her.

205
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,807
- Father!
- Bastian!

206
00:17:27,808 --> 00:17:31,231
Take my sword.

207
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:35,072
- ( Norick ) Get inside. And bolt the door.
- ( mother ) Come quickly.

208
00:17:35,073 --> 00:17:38,323
- ( Bastian ) Thank you, Father.
- Go.

209
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:41,962
( Shouting, Screaming Continue )

210
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:03,027
( Grunting, Snarling )

211
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:07,846
( Norick )
We'll look for her in the village.

212
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:10,005
( man )
Let's go, men.! Come on.

213
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:17,243
( Groans )

214
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:41,109
( Hissing )

215
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:44,907
( Scream Echoing )

216
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:47,179
( Laughing )
Well done.

217
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,852
A man with spirit, huh?

218
00:18:56,493 --> 00:19:00,856
- ( Screams )
- ( Krugs Snarling )

219
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,019
( Woman Screams )

220
00:19:25,907 --> 00:19:28,578
( Horse Snorting )

221
00:19:57,975 --> 00:20:00,951
- ( Snarling )
- Let 'em go.

222
00:20:00,952 --> 00:20:03,511
( Echoing Laughter)

223
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:08,104
You already killed me once today,
and yet, here we are again.

224
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:26,342
- Father!
- ( Groans )

225
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,630
- ( Yells )
- Run, Son!

226
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,273
( Screaming )

227
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,497
( Horse Whinnies )

228
00:21:13,412 --> 00:21:16,301
( Groans )

229
00:21:28,229 --> 00:21:30,999
( Panting )

230
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:42,707
Look! They're retreating.

231
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:45,479
Zeph!

232
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,593
- ( man ) They're going to higher ground.!
- Zeph!

233
00:23:06,006 --> 00:23:08,448
( Gulls Crying )

234
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:13,742
I need a fourth marker for Solana.

235
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:19,520
Nobody saw Solana.
Nobody knows.

236
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:22,912
We didn't find her body.
She could have escaped.

237
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:25,716
( Bastian )
He's right, Farmer.

238
00:24:50,096 --> 00:24:53,647
Gallian! Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

239
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:55,568
I've been busy.

240
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,937
( Door Closes )

241
00:24:57,938 --> 00:25:00,848
- Very busy.
- We had an agreement.

242
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:04,337
I gave you access to my castle
so that we might work together.

243
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:06,929
And I'm keeping my end.

244
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,643
I'm sure recent events demonstrate
how very busy I've been.

245
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:15,634
Yes, indeed. You have managed
to stir things up a bit.

246
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:18,177
Stir things up?

247
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:22,324
Tell me, Duke.

248
00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:25,313
What do you know of a man
they call Farmer?

249
00:25:32,502 --> 00:25:35,799
( Chattering )

250
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,839
( King )
People of Stonebridge.

251
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,134
The armies of Ehb
sympathize with you.

252
00:25:42,135 --> 00:25:45,048
This great tragedy will be avenged.

253
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:47,352
Where were the king's army
when the Krug came killing?

254
00:25:47,353 --> 00:25:50,777
Peasant, do not forget
to whom you speak.

255
00:25:50,778 --> 00:25:53,336
In your world,
don't you bow before your king?

256
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:57,036
In my world, the king's army's
expected to protect the kingdom.

257
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:01,274
- Not just the castle.
- ( Woman Weeping )

258
00:26:01,275 --> 00:26:04,143
What of those taken by the Krug?

259
00:26:05,276 --> 00:26:08,666
- Krug taking prisoners?
- Silence!

260
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,779
If these Krug have taken prisoners...

261
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,056
it is not yet clear
what their purpose might be.

262
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:19,774
( man ) The king's army will require
every man capable of combat.

263
00:26:19,775 --> 00:26:21,660
- ( Tarish ) Who is with us?
- ( Woman ) What will happen?

264
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:25,341
The king has his armies and his walls.

265
00:26:25,342 --> 00:26:28,658
Those taken by the Krug only have us.

266
00:26:30,815 --> 00:26:34,911
- ( Tarish ) You dare defy your king's wishes?
- I'm with you, Farmer.

267
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:38,016
- Guards!
- ( King ) Let them go.

268
00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:40,525
That is not the way of Ehb.

269
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:49,857
- ( Farmer) You took a risk turning your back on the king.
- No more risk than you.

270
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,327
- I have no choice. She's my wife.
- She's my sister.

271
00:26:54,147 --> 00:26:57,069
All right, let's get to it.

272
00:26:57,764 --> 00:27:01,060
Stay here. Go with the armies to Ehb.

273
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:03,076
You wanted the life
of a soldier, didn't you?

274
00:27:03,077 --> 00:27:06,774
Nah. I didn't like the uniforms.

275
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:10,884
- Do you have a horse?
- A mare.

276
00:27:10,885 --> 00:27:13,958
She's old, but still strong.

277
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:17,327
Old... but still strong.

278
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:27,592
You're in my way.

279
00:27:27,593 --> 00:27:30,459
We have met before, have we not?

280
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:43,369
( Solana's Voice )
Tell me something nice.

281
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,610
Tell me how you love me.

282
00:27:45,611 --> 00:27:48,600
( Farmer's Voice )
you know.

283
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:02,477
- I'm Merick, the king's magus.
- I've heard of you.

284
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:05,313
Children's stories about magic.

285
00:28:07,631 --> 00:28:09,614
Your king needs you.

286
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:12,559
Yeah, well, my son needed me.

287
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,257
I failed him.
Now my wife needs me, if she lives.

288
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:19,440
Does it occur to you, Farmer...

289
00:28:19,441 --> 00:28:22,769
that there may be events
of greater importance...

290
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:27,231
than the loves and losses
of our particular lives?

291
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:31,110
No. Doesn't occur to me.

292
00:28:31,635 --> 00:28:35,090
Try to stay alive, Farmer.

293
00:28:35,091 --> 00:28:37,731
Your king needs you.

294
00:28:38,644 --> 00:28:41,075
Far more than he understands.

295
00:28:41,076 --> 00:28:43,092
( Norick )
How did you know about this bridge?

296
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:45,044
( Farmer)
As a child I roamed around these parts.

297
00:28:45,045 --> 00:28:47,400
It's how I spent my days.

298
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:58,037
- If we wind through the gorge we'll lose a day.
- What are you thinking?

299
00:28:58,038 --> 00:29:00,758
We can cross it.

300
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:02,838
Let's take the gear off the horses.

301
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,855
What, do you mean
we're leaving 'em, just like that?

302
00:29:04,856 --> 00:29:08,567
Are you afraid we're gonna
hurt their feelings?

303
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:10,360
- Go home! Hah!
- Hah!

304
00:29:10,361 --> 00:29:12,617
- Hah!
- Get out of here.

305
00:29:20,187 --> 00:29:22,596
Let's do it.

306
00:29:42,942 --> 00:29:45,450
( Grunts )

307
00:29:54,144 --> 00:29:57,502
- All right, I'll go.
- You're a brave old guy.

308
00:29:57,503 --> 00:30:01,484
I just don't want you weakening the rope
before I've had my turn.

309
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:06,144
- Come on!
- All right, let's go. Come on.

310
00:30:06,145 --> 00:30:08,257
You were more concerned
about your horse.

311
00:30:08,258 --> 00:30:10,049
My horse I like.
It's you I'm not so sure about.

312
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,345
Well, wait till you get to know me better.

313
00:30:13,346 --> 00:30:16,051
( Yells )

314
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,850
( Both Yelling )

315
00:30:22,276 --> 00:30:25,427
( Stops Yelling )

316
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:33,656
( Both Groaning, Yelling )

317
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:55,668
That saved us a lot of time.

318
00:30:56,202 --> 00:30:58,807
Oh!

319
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:04,251
- ( man ) your majesty.
- ( Tarish ) Get on your feet, soldier.

320
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:08,254
( King )
How many men on guard here?

321
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:12,957
I am on guard, my king.

322
00:31:13,485 --> 00:31:16,253
Hmm. You are on guard?

323
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:22,700
- ( Duke ) Duke Fallow, you’re very, very naughty.
- ( Giggling )

324
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:25,787
You make my bosoms tickle.

325
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:29,677
I'm gonna tell your mommy.

326
00:31:29,678 --> 00:31:32,366
Where are you going?

327
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:35,737
( King )
my nephew amuses himself on the king's throne.

328
00:31:36,272 --> 00:31:38,976
Do you feel it suits you?

329
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,969
you play while your king
and his legions...

330
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,401
are off on a military campaign...

331
00:31:52,402 --> 00:31:55,826
and your only job...

332
00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:58,512
is the safety of this castle-

333
00:31:58,513 --> 00:32:02,578
which is guarded by... no one!

334
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:05,172
Your Majesty...

335
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:09,022
was off investigating
outlandish claims. Aah.!

336
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:14,790
- Get him out of my sight.
- No!

337
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:18,182
( Tarish )
Go on, before I make you.

338
00:32:22,103 --> 00:32:24,490
( Door Slams )

339
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:28,919
Unhand me. You are not fit to kiss my gown.

340
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,584
And you-You are not fit
to tarnish your uncle's crown.

341
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,088
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

342
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:39,273
Unless the king specifically orders it...

343
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,393
you cannot touch me.

344
00:32:45,402 --> 00:32:47,758
Imperial law...

345
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:52,027
is a toy...

346
00:32:52,028 --> 00:32:55,082
I shall never tire of.

347
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:04,380
- Things are progressing according to plan.
- I cannot wait any longer!

348
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:09,617
I cannot stand the suffering rule
of that senile goat.

349
00:33:13,823 --> 00:33:17,356
Make it happen.

350
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:23,328
You wish to accelerate things? Fine!

351
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:26,250
We shall accelerate.

352
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:32,597
Good.

353
00:33:47,812 --> 00:33:49,572
Gallian.

354
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:52,099
Must you always appear
suddenly from nowhere?

355
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,020
I don't.

356
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:57,042
I appear so suddenly from somewhere.

357
00:33:58,758 --> 00:34:01,412
You assume too much
entering my chambers unbidden.

358
00:34:01,413 --> 00:34:04,070
I'm not welcome to the hospitality
you've offered in the past?

359
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:07,473
You're not welcome
to come and go as you please...

360
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:10,651
and then vanish without a word.

361
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:16,968
I'm not your harlot.

362
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,951
How could you think such a thing?

363
00:34:18,952 --> 00:34:21,992
you know very well
why I must appear so quietly.

364
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,762
I can't very well be pounding
on milady's door, now, can I?

365
00:34:26,538 --> 00:34:28,586
How do you come and go as you please...

366
00:34:28,587 --> 00:34:31,306
when you're considered by my father
to be an enemy of the king?

367
00:34:31,307 --> 00:34:34,730
I have friends. I wield influence.

368
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:36,714
Why does my father despise you so?

369
00:34:36,715 --> 00:34:39,052
He's not known for his hasty opinions.

370
00:34:39,053 --> 00:34:42,573
Questions! I did not come here
to be interrogated.

371
00:34:42,574 --> 00:34:46,509
your father hates me
because I will not bow and scrape...

372
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,748
before the almighty king and his magus.

373
00:34:48,749 --> 00:34:51,021
Because I will take from him what I please-

374
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,530
Even his daughter's virtue.

375
00:34:57,071 --> 00:34:59,610
( Whispering )
Be gone from my chambers.

376
00:35:00,143 --> 00:35:03,504
- Be gone from my life.
- ( Chuckles )

377
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:05,456
Are you banishing me as well?

378
00:35:05,457 --> 00:35:08,113
And after all the work we've done.

379
00:35:08,114 --> 00:35:11,152
Haven't I helped you
discover your power, your vision?

380
00:35:11,153 --> 00:35:14,206
- You've introduced me to parlor tricks and nightmares.
- Be still.

381
00:35:17,778 --> 00:35:20,831
( muttering, Grunting )

382
00:35:34,355 --> 00:35:38,435
( Woman )
Help! Please. Please.

383
00:35:40,725 --> 00:35:42,645
My liege.

384
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:44,757
Again allow me to offer
my deepest apologies...

385
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:47,223
for mistaking your orders.

386
00:35:47,224 --> 00:35:49,206
A mistake?

387
00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:51,542
- Is that what it was?
- Yes.

388
00:35:51,543 --> 00:35:53,898
Hmm.

389
00:35:58,745 --> 00:36:01,154
May I sit, Your Majesty?

390
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:10,858
Boy!

391
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:14,472
I know- Go.

392
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,323
I know I have failed your trust
on several occasions...

393
00:36:19,324 --> 00:36:22,875
and perhaps I may be
a disappointment to you...

394
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:25,916
and the entire kingdom,
but I will change.

395
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,957
I will shed this youthful folly
in this time of great battle...

396
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:33,418
and I will prove myself a worthy heir.

397
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,872
Eat.

398
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:47,667
You show a knack, my nephew...

399
00:36:48,192 --> 00:36:50,928
for well-timed diplomacy.

400
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,976
I guess that's something.

401
00:36:54,977 --> 00:36:57,410
May I offer a toast?

402
00:36:57,411 --> 00:36:59,841
Possibly.

403
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:03,489
Drinking wine in the morning
is not a good way...

404
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,860
to show... reform.

405
00:37:08,163 --> 00:37:10,607
Indeed.

406
00:37:11,139 --> 00:37:13,712
Yes, indeed.

407
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:21,176
Long live the king.

408
00:37:21,702 --> 00:37:24,325
( Chuckles )
Yes.

409
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,334
( man )
The Krug last attacked Stonebridge, in the south.

410
00:37:27,335 --> 00:37:29,318
( Tarish )
yes, and this harsh terrain...

411
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:31,302
will drive them north,
around the marsh.

412
00:37:31,303 --> 00:37:34,118
Then we should attack.

413
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,548
That is, if the Krug behave
the way they're supposed to behave.

414
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:50,281
( Norick )
I don't like this, Farmer.

415
00:37:50,282 --> 00:37:52,265
Nobody goes into Sedgwick Forest.

416
00:37:52,266 --> 00:37:54,825
( Farmer)
The forest passes between the mountains.

417
00:37:54,826 --> 00:37:58,346
We'll come out at Slate Pass
as the Krugs arrive.

418
00:37:58,347 --> 00:38:00,330
There's more than brush
and trees in Sedgwick Forest.

419
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:02,314
You don't just cut through it
when you please.

420
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:04,523
you don't wanna
be stuck here at night.

421
00:38:04,524 --> 00:38:06,507
- We'll light torches.
- Torches attract eyes.

422
00:38:06,508 --> 00:38:08,383
- Let 'em look.
- Farmer!

423
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:15,725
You know what people say.
There are... things in Sedgwick Forest.

424
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,124
People say God watches over the innocent.

425
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:22,094
People say a lot of things
that won't help us now, Norick.

426
00:38:22,095 --> 00:38:25,345
Come on. We've got a lot
of ground to cover.

427
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,319
( Norick )
I don't see any path.

428
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,115
- There is no path.
- So how do we know where we're going?

429
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,245
( Whispering )
Wait.

430
00:39:19,037 --> 00:39:22,352
Whoa!

431
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:41,999
Oh!

432
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:49,808
( Bastian )
You were right, Norick.

433
00:39:56,356 --> 00:39:59,442
Is this part of the plan, Farmer?

434
00:40:02,084 --> 00:40:06,032
- Let us down.
- When I'm ready.

435
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:16,325
Get out of our forest.
you have no business here.

436
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:18,918
We hate your weapons
and your killing.

437
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:21,415
- We're passing through, that's all.
- Then pass through...

438
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:23,770
and never come back.

439
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,395
( Both Yelling )

440
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:39,978
We're, uh-We're lost.

441
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:44,276
men- Not only useless,
but helpless as well.

442
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,531
Your Majesty.

443
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:49,451
I beg of you news of my father.

444
00:40:49,452 --> 00:40:53,067
- Your father has gone on an errand for his king.
- Please-

445
00:40:53,068 --> 00:40:56,765
What's happening?
I worry that he's in grave danger.

446
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,134
The king's magus
has many responsibilities.

447
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:11,726
What he does not need is a daughter...

448
00:41:11,727 --> 00:41:14,127
who's troubling herself
with the affairs of men.

449
00:41:14,128 --> 00:41:17,487
My father thinks that keeping me
locked in this castle will ease my mind.

450
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:21,468
He's wrong. I know the mood of this court.
It's never been more troubled.

451
00:41:30,225 --> 00:41:32,914
Darkness threatens...

452
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:35,763
our empire.

453
00:41:35,764 --> 00:41:38,706
Darkness that's spawned by magic.

454
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:40,963
Come on! Hey.

455
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:44,819
your father seeks reason...

456
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:48,437
- and remedy.
- Your Majesty? Your Majesty?

457
00:41:48,438 --> 00:41:50,773
- Your father-
- Your Majesty!

458
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:54,623
Gallian.! I feel like I'm dying.

459
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:58,664
Did you dine well with the king?

460
00:42:02,422 --> 00:42:05,302
- What have you done?
- ( Chuckling )

461
00:42:05,303 --> 00:42:08,951
I thought you were in a hurry
to accelerate things.

462
00:42:08,952 --> 00:42:11,754
( Groans )

463
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,840
I suppose I may have tampered
with the king's food.

464
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:17,273
You've poisoned me.
You've killed me.

465
00:42:17,274 --> 00:42:20,312
- Don't be so melodramatic.
- ( Groans )

466
00:42:20,313 --> 00:42:23,781
It's nothing that can't be fixed.

467
00:42:28,827 --> 00:42:31,214
( Groaning )

468
00:42:34,588 --> 00:42:36,998
Please.

469
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:40,188
Please!

470
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:42,544
( Chuckles )

471
00:42:44,926 --> 00:42:48,030
Let us hope you remember
who has the real power here.

472
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:50,156
Yes.

473
00:42:54,911 --> 00:42:57,321
( Panting )

474
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:05,823
I'd say I've saved your life.

475
00:43:05,824 --> 00:43:08,660
Now what shall you do for me?

476
00:43:23,044 --> 00:43:25,432
The king has been poisoned.

477
00:43:26,085 --> 00:43:28,003
Can he be saved?

478
00:43:28,004 --> 00:43:31,800
Perhaps, if it's not too late.

479
00:43:44,615 --> 00:43:47,155
On my soul.

480
00:43:55,337 --> 00:43:58,042
A word in private.

481
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:08,874
Fallow has fled the castle...

482
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,859
and he's taken two full legions with him.

483
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,476
( Merick )
Well, that tells us who poisoned the king.

484
00:44:14,477 --> 00:44:17,324
Prepare to move to the north,
where we shall meet our new allies.

485
00:44:17,325 --> 00:44:19,403
The strength of our combined armies...

486
00:44:19,404 --> 00:44:22,925
shall allow for generations
of peace and tranquility.

487
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,037
I detect the hand
of Gallian in this.

488
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:29,400
Why has Commander Tarish
not briefed us for this mission?

489
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:32,831
( Groans )

490
00:44:35,279 --> 00:44:38,383
Anyone else care to commit treason?

491
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,782
- How much of the army remains?
- A third.

492
00:44:40,783 --> 00:44:42,863
Hmm.

493
00:44:42,864 --> 00:44:45,616
Well, I have seen the Krug massing.

494
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:47,824
Gallian is raising armies-

495
00:44:47,825 --> 00:44:50,448
- vast armies.
- How?

496
00:44:50,449 --> 00:44:54,911
How is that possible-That a single man
can cause so much devastation?

497
00:44:57,907 --> 00:45:01,491
My own daughter betraying me
to my sworn enemy.

498
00:45:01,492 --> 00:45:04,742
- Do you hate me that much?
- ( Moans )

499
00:45:06,515 --> 00:45:08,467
I thought that I loved him.

500
00:45:08,468 --> 00:45:12,884
He has tapped into our bloodline.

501
00:45:12,885 --> 00:45:16,148
You have tilted the balance
of magic in his favor.

502
00:45:16,149 --> 00:45:20,097
Thanks to you, the kingdom may be lost.

503
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:23,926
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

504
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:28,618
( Weeping )
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

505
00:45:32,056 --> 00:45:34,041
( Norick )
Why do you hate outsiders?

506
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:37,176
You hate each other.
Why shouldn't we hate you too?

507
00:45:37,177 --> 00:45:40,857
We stay in the forest to avoid
your wars and your contests...

508
00:45:40,858 --> 00:45:42,777
and your mindless enterprise.

509
00:45:42,778 --> 00:45:46,618
And yet, here you are,
shooting your arrows into our trees.

510
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,146
Harm is but a way of life
for your people.

511
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:53,390
The fact that you don't realize
it is what makes you so dangerous.

512
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:03,901
( Woman )
This is as far as I will take you.

513
00:46:03,902 --> 00:46:06,190
Good luck.

514
00:46:08,351 --> 00:46:10,270
( Muttering, Grunting )

515
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:13,309
( Norick )
Do we have a plan?

516
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,710
( Bastian Groans )

517
00:46:15,711 --> 00:46:18,066
( Grunting, Groaning )

518
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:43,266
Are you awake?

519
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,474
( King )
yes, I'm awake.

520
00:46:45,475 --> 00:46:48,911
You'll find it's not so easy to kill a king.

521
00:46:50,948 --> 00:46:53,336
We will attack.

522
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:56,996
But, Your Majesty,
you have been poisoned.

523
00:46:56,997 --> 00:47:00,260
- Perhaps you haven't your bearings.
- I have my bearings, Commander.

524
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:02,309
And I have my wits.

525
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:06,040
The Krugs do not expect us to attack,
so that's exactly what we will do.

526
00:47:07,078 --> 00:47:09,553
Who poisoned me?

527
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:14,457
I believe it was your nephew, Duke Fallow.

528
00:47:15,015 --> 00:47:17,458
Oh.

529
00:47:19,592 --> 00:47:21,513
- ( Sighs )
- And there's worse.

530
00:47:21,514 --> 00:47:23,625
He has abandoned the castle...

531
00:47:23,626 --> 00:47:26,248
taken the guard
and the 11th and 12th legions.

532
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:28,745
We will attack.

533
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:32,312
First light. Summon your troops.

534
00:47:37,515 --> 00:47:40,121
How much time do I have?

535
00:47:44,076 --> 00:47:46,715
Your life is coming to a close...

536
00:47:47,245 --> 00:47:49,709
but there is time enough.

537
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,629
( Thunder Rumbling )

538
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:54,170
( Thunderclap )

539
00:47:57,038 --> 00:47:59,630
You sure about this, Norick?

540
00:47:59,631 --> 00:48:02,040
Not at all.

541
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:13,891
- ( Woman, Indistinct )
- Shh!

542
00:48:17,298 --> 00:48:20,242
She's here, Norick.

543
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:23,077
- I can feel it.
- I think you're right.

544
00:48:34,452 --> 00:48:37,441
( Grunting )

545
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:42,567
Hey, hey! Easy.

546
00:48:46,582 --> 00:48:49,122
Solana?

547
00:48:50,486 --> 00:48:52,994
Solana!
( Grunts )

548
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,563
Today...

549
00:49:21,564 --> 00:49:24,398
we ride for our king.

550
00:49:28,221 --> 00:49:31,982
And our king proudly fights...

551
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:37,606
- in the name of Ehb!
- ( Cheering )

552
00:49:42,175 --> 00:49:44,563
Your Majesty.

553
00:49:47,745 --> 00:49:50,462
Ride!

554
00:49:50,463 --> 00:49:55,137
God blesses those
who die for honor and truth.!

555
00:49:55,138 --> 00:49:57,971
( Cheering )

556
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,314
( Groans )

557
00:50:09,315 --> 00:50:11,888
I'm curious about you, Farmer.

558
00:50:13,092 --> 00:50:15,811
I sense danger in you.

559
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,955
I can't read you.

560
00:50:17,956 --> 00:50:21,348
I can read most men,
like reading scrolls of flesh.

561
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:24,676
But you- you, I can't see
past your scowl.

562
00:50:24,677 --> 00:50:27,218
Why is that?

563
00:50:42,898 --> 00:50:45,521
( Echoing )
Who are you?

564
00:50:45,522 --> 00:50:48,657
Some riddles aren't worth solving.

565
00:50:48,658 --> 00:50:51,525
( Grunts )

566
00:50:58,164 --> 00:51:01,348
( Panting )

567
00:51:08,085 --> 00:51:10,725
( Moans )

568
00:51:14,198 --> 00:51:16,887
You are here.

569
00:51:16,888 --> 00:51:19,558
I thought it a nightmare.

570
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:25,322
Where is Farmer?

571
00:51:30,425 --> 00:51:33,194
Where is Zeph?

572
00:51:33,945 --> 00:51:37,293
Bastian, where is Zeph?
Is he with our parents?

573
00:51:38,938 --> 00:51:40,889
Yes.

574
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,366
He's with them, but...

575
00:51:44,219 --> 00:51:46,138
he didn't make it.

576
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:49,803
He... was killed with them
the day you were taken.

577
00:51:50,364 --> 00:51:52,718
I'm sorry.

578
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:55,817
( Sobbing )
My baby.

579
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:04,337
Did he die quickly?

580
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,370
Tell me.

581
00:52:09,824 --> 00:52:11,997
Yes.

582
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:14,441
He died quickly.

583
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,806
Farmer will come.

584
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:29,472
He'll find you.

585
00:52:29,473 --> 00:52:31,554
( Solana )
How do you know?

586
00:52:31,555 --> 00:52:33,909
( Norick )
Because he must.

587
00:52:34,435 --> 00:52:36,930
Because he needs you.

588
00:52:36,931 --> 00:52:40,945
At the end of the day,
you're all he really needs.

589
00:53:06,824 --> 00:53:09,799
( Groaning )

590
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,374
( Hoof beats )

591
00:53:15,978 --> 00:53:18,248
Don't die on me now, Farmer.

592
00:53:18,249 --> 00:53:20,201
Much for you to do.

593
00:53:20,202 --> 00:53:23,353
( Grunts )
Not looking too good, are you?

594
00:53:25,548 --> 00:53:27,499
( Grunts )
Ah. There.

595
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,865
Try a bit of this.

596
00:53:29,866 --> 00:53:32,619
( Gagging )

597
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:35,244
- What's it like?
- What is it?

598
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:38,495
( Laughing )
That's medicine. Come on.

599
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:51,769
( Woman moans )

600
00:54:04,689 --> 00:54:07,045
( man, Indistinct )

601
00:54:09,234 --> 00:54:11,794
- ( Woman ) No.!
- ( man Groans )

602
00:54:11,795 --> 00:54:13,714
( Gallian Chuckling )

603
00:54:13,715 --> 00:54:16,287
It's good to be home.

604
00:54:24,244 --> 00:54:26,452
( Muriella's Voice )
I am not your harlot.

605
00:54:26,453 --> 00:54:28,372
( Merick's Voice )
He has used you to destroy-

606
00:54:28,373 --> 00:54:30,324
( Gallian's Voice )
I know that poets claim-

607
00:54:30,325 --> 00:54:34,100
( Merick ) He bends emotion for sport.
Have you learned nothing?

608
00:54:34,101 --> 00:54:38,497
( Gallian ) Haven't I helped you
discover your power, your vision?

609
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:51,970
My lady?

610
00:54:53,434 --> 00:54:55,843
( Weeping )

611
00:54:56,473 --> 00:54:58,873
I am my father's undoing.

612
00:54:58,874 --> 00:55:01,337
I've jeopardized everything.

613
00:55:01,338 --> 00:55:04,391
But your father has
nothing but love for you.

614
00:55:05,756 --> 00:55:09,786
My girlish stupidity
has damaged him.

615
00:55:09,787 --> 00:55:13,354
Taking your life would damage him further.

616
00:55:17,405 --> 00:55:19,847
( Exhales )

617
00:55:21,757 --> 00:55:24,330
Perhaps you're right.

618
00:55:24,862 --> 00:55:27,486
I would like my father
to be proud of me.

619
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,014
He already is.

620
00:55:30,015 --> 00:55:32,817
He's proud of an idea of me.

621
00:55:48,385 --> 00:55:50,721
( Fallow )
Prepare to meet your new allies.

622
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,058
These are Krug.

623
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:56,930
( Fallow )
Obedient, relentless and unquestioning.

624
00:55:56,931 --> 00:55:59,765
What you see before you
is a powerful army.

625
00:56:09,572 --> 00:56:11,961
( Horse Whinnies )

626
00:56:18,182 --> 00:56:20,132
( Merick )
Take this man.

627
00:56:20,133 --> 00:56:22,662
Put him in the king's tent.

628
00:56:22,663 --> 00:56:25,530
See that my horse is well fed.

629
00:56:27,081 --> 00:56:29,467
Hold.

630
00:56:30,824 --> 00:56:33,496
So was this your urgent errand?

631
00:56:34,345 --> 00:56:37,512
This is the farmer...
from Stonebridge.

632
00:56:37,513 --> 00:56:41,353
- It is.
- ( Exhales )

633
00:56:41,354 --> 00:56:45,066
Now why does a disloyal dirt-lover
from Stonebridge...

634
00:56:45,067 --> 00:56:47,530
command such careful attention
from the king's magus?

635
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:50,346
Because the king has
a special interest in this... dirt-lover.

636
00:56:50,347 --> 00:56:52,971
I know nothing of this interest.

637
00:56:52,972 --> 00:56:55,381
Neither does the king.

638
00:57:02,605 --> 00:57:07,100
I thought it was about time
that you two were properly introduced.

639
00:57:07,694 --> 00:57:10,049
We've met.

640
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:13,659
But the last time,
he turned his back on me.

641
00:57:16,047 --> 00:57:18,752
Turned to what needed doing.

642
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,839
I thought Your Majesty
would be interested in this farmer.

643
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,687
He's been through a great deal
since we met him in Stonebridge.

644
00:57:24,688 --> 00:57:26,832
So has everyone else.

645
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:29,681
What makes him so special?

646
00:57:29,682 --> 00:57:31,601
Because, Your Majesty...

647
00:57:31,602 --> 00:57:33,991
he is your son.

648
00:57:40,306 --> 00:57:43,218
( Merick )
Farmer has a friend- Norick.

649
00:57:43,219 --> 00:57:45,458
Norick tended the queen's horses.

650
00:57:45,459 --> 00:57:48,308
I recognized him
when we were in Stonebridge.

651
00:57:48,309 --> 00:57:51,604
After the massacre
at Oxley Pass, this Norick...

652
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:55,796
found a boy about three years of age
wandering in the battlefield.

653
00:57:55,797 --> 00:57:58,196
There was only one boy at Oxley Pass.

654
00:57:58,197 --> 00:58:01,697
What do you think
of this tale, Farmer?

655
00:58:07,254 --> 00:58:11,415
One old man thinks he recognizes another
from 30 years ago.

656
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:14,583
That's how you determine who's king?

657
00:58:14,584 --> 00:58:18,860
You are the king's son,
and heir to the throne.

658
00:58:20,858 --> 00:58:23,096
I have no father-

659
00:58:23,097 --> 00:58:25,453
No parents.

660
00:58:26,075 --> 00:58:28,462
I have no business here.

661
00:58:36,636 --> 00:58:40,795
Are you telling me that
that arrogant bastard is my son?

662
00:58:40,796 --> 00:58:43,356
He spent the last 30 years...

663
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:47,197
living over a Stonebridge farm?

664
00:58:47,198 --> 00:58:49,309
It would appear so.

665
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:52,958
It would appear so.
You told me he was dead.!

666
00:58:52,959 --> 00:58:56,141
You said they were all dead!

667
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,159
What kind of joke...

668
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,962
do the gods play on me?

669
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:12,479
Sometimes the gods
know what is best for us.

670
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,360
What the hell does that mean?

671
00:59:15,361 --> 00:59:19,041
You remember the chaos
we were in? Hmm?

672
00:59:19,042 --> 00:59:22,017
War everywhere.
Surrounded by enemies.

673
00:59:22,018 --> 00:59:24,802
If that child had been
taken back to Castle Ehb...

674
00:59:24,803 --> 00:59:27,746
how long would he have survived?

675
00:59:27,747 --> 00:59:29,730
Growing up in Stonebridge...

676
00:59:29,731 --> 00:59:32,387
he grew up strong...

677
00:59:32,388 --> 00:59:34,436
and far away from the enemies...

678
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:36,421
who would have jumped
at any opportunity...

679
00:59:36,422 --> 00:59:39,093
to rid you of your son and heir.

680
00:59:42,822 --> 00:59:45,381
Dear friend...

681
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:48,784
you better be right about him.

682
00:59:50,279 --> 00:59:52,966
You better be sure.

683
00:59:52,967 --> 00:59:56,263
( Chattering )

684
00:59:56,264 --> 01:00:00,520
The king needs every able man
he can get for this battle.

685
01:00:00,521 --> 01:00:05,129
- That's not my problem.
- His kingdom is threatened. Your kingdom is threatened.

686
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:07,996
I don't know this king.

687
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,145
Solana's my family.

688
01:00:11,146 --> 01:00:14,964
Norick and Bastian.
They are my family.

689
01:00:16,107 --> 01:00:19,146
And where will you live?

690
01:00:19,147 --> 01:00:21,503
Hmm?

691
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,523
When the kingdom falls to Gallian...

692
01:00:24,524 --> 01:00:28,124
what future will you
be able to offer your wife?

693
01:00:29,262 --> 01:00:31,420
Think about it.

694
01:00:49,904 --> 01:00:51,857
Fallow, you have committed treason.

695
01:00:51,858 --> 01:00:55,249
We offer no quarter here.

696
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,136
And anyone who follows
under your command...

697
01:00:57,137 --> 01:00:59,409
will likewise be
considered as a defector.

698
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:02,034
We will spare no traitor.

699
01:01:02,035 --> 01:01:03,954
( Fallow )
Gentlemen...

700
01:01:03,955 --> 01:01:05,937
Commander Tarish
has poisoned the king...

701
01:01:05,938 --> 01:01:08,466
and accuses me of treason.

702
01:01:08,467 --> 01:01:10,738
Hah.!

703
01:01:10,739 --> 01:01:12,819
Your ambition has no limits, Tarish.

704
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:16,789
The Kingdom of Ehb
is now subject to my rule.

705
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:21,185
We, as well, offer no quarters.

706
01:01:32,566 --> 01:01:34,550
You will never be king, my nephew...

707
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:37,143
because you have no valor-

708
01:01:37,144 --> 01:01:40,710
Not now, not ever.

709
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,862
The 11th and 12th legions
are with you, Your Majesty.

710
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:55,018
( Fallow )
You coward!

711
01:02:04,316 --> 01:02:08,603
( Tarish ) These Krug have no archers,
but they also have no fear.

712
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:11,580
Now, they outnumber us,
but we are men...

713
01:02:11,581 --> 01:02:14,845
- and we serve a noble kingdom.
- ( Troops Cheer )

714
01:02:14,846 --> 01:02:18,077
They are beasts, with bloodlust.
Nothing more.

715
01:02:18,078 --> 01:02:21,361
( Cheering )

716
01:02:23,102 --> 01:02:25,393
So, have you come to do your duty?

717
01:02:25,887 --> 01:02:27,807
I've decided to fight.

718
01:02:27,808 --> 01:02:31,808
I'll be proud to have you fight by my side
so that I might keep an eye on you.

719
01:02:31,809 --> 01:02:34,163
( Clicks Tongue )

720
01:02:56,919 --> 01:02:58,980
Mid guard.

721
01:03:02,615 --> 01:03:05,025
( Horse Whinnies )

722
01:03:20,187 --> 01:03:23,834
- (Jingles )
- Commander.

723
01:03:23,835 --> 01:03:26,246
Lead out.

724
01:03:31,997 --> 01:03:34,352
( All Grunting )

725
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,822
( All Grunt )

726
01:03:49,598 --> 01:03:51,342
Archers.
