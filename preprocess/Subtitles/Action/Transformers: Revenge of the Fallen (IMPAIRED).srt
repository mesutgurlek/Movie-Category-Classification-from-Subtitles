Earth.
Birth place of the human race.

2
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:05,220
A species
much like our own.

3
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:09,085
Capable
of great compassion...

4
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:10,785
17,000 BC.

5
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,328
and great violence.

6
00:01:23,507 --> 00:01:26,561
For in our quest
to protect the humans,

7
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:29,831
a deeper revelation dawns.

8
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:33,588
Our worlds
have met before.

9
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,021
Here, here.

12
00:02:20,732 --> 00:02:22,404
Breaking news
at Shanghai.

13
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:25,806
There's been a major toxic spill
on the Shanghai Central District.

Pentagon:
NEST Central Command

19
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,799
- What's the status?
- C-hawks approaching target.

20
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,608
Three minutes
until evacuation's complete, sir.

21
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:45,737
Chinese airspace has been
locked and sealed.

22
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:47,189
One mile radius.

23
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,971
Alright, give NEST team
the go.

24
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:50,725
Black Hawks,
clear to land.

25
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,216
 Ding-a-ling,
come out and get your ice cream 

26
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:01,731
Any bad robot out there
better get ready for ass-whooping.

27
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:11,368
For the last two years,
an advanced team of new Autobots

28
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:14,136
has taken refuge here
under my command.

29
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:16,365
Arcees,
get ready to launch.

30
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,069
We're locked and loaded.

31
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:21,636
Together, we form an alliance
with the humans.

32
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:25,581
A secret,
a brave squad of soldiers.

33
00:03:25,616 --> 00:03:26,597
Alright, that's enough.

34
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:28,695
Time discovered story
in this one is toxic spill.

35
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:30,891
They had to evac the area
for search and rescue.

36
00:03:30,926 --> 00:03:33,555
This makes six enemy contacts
in eight months.

37
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,970
We gotta make sure this one
does not get out the public axe

38
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:36,910
so keep it tight.

39
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:40,798
A classified strike team
called NEST.

40
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:44,745
We hunt for what remains
of our Decepticon foes,

41
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,823
hiding in different countries
around the globe.

42
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,680
Rolling Alpha
through Echo now.

43
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,349
Alright, Ironhide.

44
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:22,462
We got Echo's.
Vamos.

45
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,903
To the stacks.
Two o'clock.

46
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:37,315
He's here.

47
00:04:38,784 --> 00:04:40,111
I smell him.

48
00:04:44,295 --> 00:04:46,302
It's close.
It's heading closer.

49
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,373
Oh, no.

50
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:53,486
How are ya?

51
00:04:54,134 --> 00:04:55,470
It's three ripple.

52
00:04:58,191 --> 00:04:59,994
Alright, everybody,
be steady.

53
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,271
We're right on top
of it.

54
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:14,256
Ease on fire.

55
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:33,836
Hand to one.
Requesting fire mission now!

56
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:36,230
Gunships on station.
Rolling hot.

57
00:05:46,893 --> 00:05:48,314
We intersected a Decepticon.

58
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:54,258
Arcee twins,
target coming your way.

59
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:00,245
Watch out!

60
00:06:30,488 --> 00:06:33,620
I screwed that up.
I'm okay, I'm alright.

61
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:36,726
This is kinda bad, man.
What's wrong with you?

62
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,134
Three insides white.

63
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:45,535
Clear and fast.

64
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:03,244
Damn, I'm good.

65
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,727
Air support, we need Big Booter
delivered and dropped now.

66
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:16,886
Code 9-A...

67
00:07:18,841 --> 00:07:22,901
Dropping in five, four,
three, two, one.

68
00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:38,872
Autobots, I'm in pursuit.

69
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:09,060
Pull over.

70
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:31,969
Punk-ass Decepticon,

71
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:34,738
any last words?

72
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:38,058
This is not your planet
to rule.

73
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:41,203
The Fallen shall rise again.

74
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:43,998
That doesn't sound good.

75
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:45,783
Not today.

76
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:53,615
Come on, let's go.
All hands on deck.

77
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:55,338
Frankie, Mojo, out.

78
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:56,056
Come on, kiddo,

79
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:57,464
- we're on a schedule here.
- Slow down, Dad.

80
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:59,134
Why are you in such a hurry
to get rid of me, huh?

81
00:08:59,169 --> 00:09:00,386
Did you
rent the room out?

82
00:09:00,411 --> 00:09:02,173
No, I got other ideas
for your room

83
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,870
and it rhymes with
home theater.

84
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,013
Look what I found.
It's your little baby booties.

85
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:15,027
Oh, Ma...

86
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:18,755
Oh my little baby, booty boy,
you can't go.

87
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,153
You see this?

88
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:20,265
That's how
you're supposed to react

89
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,422
when you free your loins does not uncool
the world to pep for himself, okay?

90
00:09:23,457 --> 00:09:25,815
Yeah, my heart...
Please treat it about college, bummer.

91
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:28,832
You have to come home
every holiday,

92
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:30,054
not just big ones.

93
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:32,220
You have to come home
for Halloween.

94
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:33,734
I can't come home
for Halloween, Mom.

95
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:35,667
- We'll come to you.
- No, we're not going anywhere.

96
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:38,226
- You dress up, we'll be in costumes.
- You-You can't do that.

97
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:40,214
Would you let the kid breathe,
for crying out loud?

98
00:09:40,215 --> 00:09:41,319
Come on, go, pack!

99
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:41,876
There's no way
you're packed

100
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:43,192
for a month long trip.
Come on!

101
00:09:43,193 --> 00:09:44,318
Time-chop.
Let's go!

102
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:45,831
March, young lady.

103
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:48,019
- Oh, oh, Dad!
- I love you when you call me

104
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,865
young lady,
you dirty, old man.

105
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,115
Nah, you ain't seen nothing yet.

106
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,263
- Dad, Dad, Dad, whoa!
- What?

107
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:54,276
I'm watching
what you're doing, Dad.

108
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:55,222
It's not a rap video.

109
00:09:55,257 --> 00:09:57,228
Just like a coach thing,
you know.

110
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,020
That's a really creepy move
just now, Dad.

111
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:01,571
Look, you're the hero, uh...

112
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,097
Your mother and me
are really, really proud of you.

113
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,598
You're the first Witwiky
ever to go to college.

114
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:10,395
Now I'm crying again.
This sucks!

115
00:10:10,547 --> 00:10:11,882
You're gonna be okay, Ma.

116
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:13,869
Now this is going to be, uh...

117
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,491
You know,
hard for her to...

118
00:10:16,724 --> 00:10:19,171
accept that her boy's
all grown up, you know.

119
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:22,952
Going out to handle
the world on its own.

120
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:24,002
- You okay, Pop?
- Yeah.

121
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:27,205
Mojo, no dominating Frankie!

122
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,100
Get the hell of the couch,
ya filthy beasts!

123
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:30,654
Wow.

124
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:32,844
You see a lot of that
in college too.

125
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,507
What are you
talking about, Dad?

126
00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:36,518
There's gonna be
a lot of women there.

127
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,132
Yeah, well, I'm
the one-woman kind of guy.

128
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:39,744
Look,
Mikaela is the greatest,

129
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,408
but you gotta give each other
room to grow, okay?

130
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:44,537
You're no different
than any other couple your age.

131
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:46,471
Till we discovered
an alien race together.

132
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,615
How long are you gonna be
riding that scooter?

133
00:10:48,926 --> 00:10:54,014
[SONG: 21 Guns
BAND: Green Day]

134
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:01,108
Dad, listen,
I know what the odds are.

135
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:02,446
We're the exception,
okay?

136
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:03,582
Wait a second...

137
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:06,959
- Oh, who could that be?
- Two weeks, it could be Muffy.

138
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:08,599
Hey, beautiful.

139
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:11,132
- I'm breaking up with you, Sam.
- Really?

140
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,635
You sure?
I hear a lot of conviction.

141
00:11:12,665 --> 00:11:14,061
Well, I am, okay?

142
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:16,316
So there's no reason for me
to come say goodbye to you.

143
00:11:16,644 --> 00:11:18,645
Wow, you almost sounded
serious that time.

144
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:19,878
Guess what?

145
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:22,137
I made you a long-distance
relationship kit.

146
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:25,102
Yeah, I got you a webcam
so we can chat 24/7.

147
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:26,496
All Witwicky all the time.

148
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:27,877
I got you
a couple of souveniers

149
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:29,842
that you bet that cannot be
mentioned on cellphone.

150
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:31,540
Some mixes
and candles and stuff...

151
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:32,955
Sounds cute,
I can't wait.

152
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:33,952
Oh, hey!

153
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:35,778
You want the infamous
D-Day shirt?

154
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:38,222
You kept your nasty,
shredded clothes?

155
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,544
Yeah, of course
I kept it, Mikaela.

156
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:41,710
It's like my Superbowl jersey.
I bled in this thing.

157
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,304
Wow, you're pretty
confident, huh?

158
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:44,542
No, it's not that.

159
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:47,027
It's just that my low self-esteem's
at an all-time high.

160
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:49,002
Do you think
your little box of souveniers

161
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:50,491
is gonna keep me
from leaving you?

162
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:51,845
You really should
come with me,

163
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,658
they got cheap apartments
in campus.

164
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:55,587
Well,
that's not gonna happen

165
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:58,784
until I get my man child father
rushed out of prison,

166
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,983
back on his feet.

167
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:01,210
I heard that.

168
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,487
Where did you put
the clutch covers?

169
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:03,744
Next to the cam shafts.

170
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,130
I love it when you say cam shafts.
Whisper it to me.

171
00:12:08,235 --> 00:12:10,299
Cam shafts.

172
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:12,644
God, I hate you.

173
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:14,664
It's my Witwicky charm.

174
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:16,954
Wait, hold on.
Wait, hold on a second.

175
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:18,614
I guess
we're not breaking up.

176
00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:20,137
I'll be over in 20.

177
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:21,074
Mikaela...

178
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:23,873
I think this little bit Cube
got stuck on my shirt.

179
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,095
Sam?

180
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,495
Oh God!
It's a fire!

181
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,822
Dad, we got a fire!

182
00:13:00,724 --> 00:13:02,344
Fire!

183
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:14,377
Ron, did you know
it was gonna be

184
00:13:14,412 --> 00:13:16,387
- this hard?
- C-Can you just stop?

185
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:18,021
- Yeah, okay, I'll stop.
- Just wait...

186
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:19,542
- You carry this shit.
- I'll--I'll...

187
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:30,713
- Wow!
- You know what?

188
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:32,344
I don't wanna go
anywhere with you.

189
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,356
I don't wanna go
to France with you.

190
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:35,077
I don't wanna go
around the corner with you.

191
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:36,421
- Alright, fine.
- I'm just going back inside.

192
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:37,718
I'll call you from Paris.

193
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:50,994
What is all the racket?

194
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:52,020
- Whoa.
- Sam?

195
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,075
- Whoa, whoa.
- Dad...

196
00:14:00,396 --> 00:14:02,307
- What was that?
- It's the whole kitchen!

197
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:06,845
Help me...
Oh my--

198
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,228
Bumblebee!

199
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:21,225
Oh, jeez!

200
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:29,282
Phone 9-1-1.

201
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:31,674
Bumblebee!
Get in the garage.

202
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:33,294
What the frick
is happening?

203
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:34,600
What happened
to restraint, man?

204
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:36,420
Just go in the garage,
quietly please?

205
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,610
Holy mother!

206
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:43,633
Oh, my God!

207
00:14:45,403 --> 00:14:47,269
I--In the garage, now!

208
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:55,571
Power's out!
Get the cops out!

209
00:14:57,617 --> 00:14:59,528
Come on, you guys.
What are you waiting for?

210
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:07,253
My house is on fire!

211
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,457
- What happened?
- Come here.

212
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,605
Listen, I need you
to take the Cube sliver.

213
00:15:16,606 --> 00:15:17,929
Put it in your purse,
right now.

214
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:19,614
- Sam Witwicky...
- Yes, Mom.

215
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:20,871
- A word with you.
- Yeah.

216
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:21,693
- Hi, Mikaela.
- Hi.

217
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:22,812
- I have a bald spot.
- Oh.

218
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:25,288
- An old furnace, I think.
- Become a waffle iron.

219
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:26,608
When you go, he goes.

220
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,179
I cannot live with
this psychotic alien in my garage.

221
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:30,200
Judy, shh.

222
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,888
National security.

223
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:35,177
Look, if we stay quiet,
they're gonna take care of everything.

224
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,508
Just consider this the official start
of a remodel, okay?

225
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,093
Fine. If the government's paying,
I want a pool...

226
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,312
- and a hot tub.
- Fine. Okay.

227
00:15:42,347 --> 00:15:45,057
And I'm gonna skinny-dip
and you can't say shit about it!

228
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:49,626
Yeah, you know
you're a tool.

229
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:53,127
- He's having voice problems.
- He's playing it up.

230
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,790
Bee, I want to talk to you
about the college thing, okay?

231
00:15:57,626 --> 00:15:59,471
I'm so excited 

232
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,485
Hey.

233
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,149
I'm not taking you
with me.

234
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:05,969
I wanna wait outside,
okay?

235
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:09,878
I wanted to tell you
about this earlier.

236
00:16:09,913 --> 00:16:11,488
It's just that--
You know,

237
00:16:11,523 --> 00:16:12,278
Here's the thing.

238
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,739
Freshmen aren't allowed
to have cars.

239
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:17,530
I know, and if it was up to me,
I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

240
00:16:17,694 --> 00:16:18,932
Look, you're an Autobot.

241
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:20,621
You shouldn't be living
in my dad's garage.

242
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:22,205
I mean,
you're suffocating in here.

243
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:24,011
You deserve
better than this.

244
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:25,994
This is hard enough, man,

245
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:27,856
don't make it harder.
Can you just look at me, please?

246
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:31,468
Come on, big guy.

247
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:35,241
Look, the guardian thing is done, okay?
You did your job.

248
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:36,651
Look, I'm safe now.

249
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:39,197
You need to go be with
Optimus Prime and the others.

250
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:40,705
I just want
to be normal, Bee.

251
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,148
That's why
I'm going to college.

252
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:44,217
I can't do that
with you.

253
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,068
It's not the last time
I'm gonna see you, you know, Bee.

254
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:51,264
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.

255
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:54,971
But you'll always be
my first car.

256
00:16:57,858 --> 00:16:58,884
Love you, Bee.

257
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:06,464
Wow!

258
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:09,415
Between state farm and the taxpayers,
we're all taken care of.

259
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:11,446
- You got dirt all over you.
- Stop, stop.

260
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:13,038
- What?
- It's--I'm okay.

261
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:13,931
Well, look.

262
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:15,920
So you think
you can make it

263
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,753
through those East Coast
winners without me?

264
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,528
You're like the best thing
that ever happened to me.

265
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:21,082
And?

266
00:17:21,493 --> 00:17:25,000
- And I'll do anything for you.
- And?

267
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,923
- I think Sam's about to say the L word.
- Let's go, kiddo.

268
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:29,447
Nice timing, Dad.

269
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:31,761
I... adore you.

270
00:17:32,963 --> 00:17:34,875
That's not the word that
I wanna hear really now.

271
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,526
What are you
talking about?

272
00:17:35,566 --> 00:17:36,522
It's the same word
as the other word.

273
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,572
- It's not the same word.
- Look, if I said the other word now,

274
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:39,982
you forced me to say
won't mean anything.

275
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:40,956
Plus, you haven't
said it either.

276
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:42,542
So don't get mad at me
for not saying it.

277
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,234
Yeah,
but I haven't said it

278
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:45,034
because guys always run
when you say it first.

279
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,084
Yeah, well,
so do girls.

280
00:17:46,124 --> 00:17:47,866
Especially,
girls like you with options.

281
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:51,952
So this is all part
of your elaborate plan

282
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,120
to keep me interested?

283
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:54,668
Can be.

284
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:56,886
Ain't those working?

285
00:17:57,636 --> 00:17:58,724
Have a kiss.

286
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,889
We'll make it work,
I promise.

- That hurt, man.

301
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:29,463
It's supposed to hurt.
It's an ass kicking.

what an honor.

Now with your permission,
I can't let you see him

318
00:20:59,173 --> 00:21:01,435
but I would like you to hear
from the leader of the Autobots.

319
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:02,413
Proceed.

320
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:22,125
You gotta wonder.

321
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:26,475
God made us in his image.
Who made him?

322
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:32,277
General, our alliance has countermanded
6 Decepticon incursions this year.

323
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:34,878
Each on
a different continent.

324
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,804
They're clearly searching
around the world for something.

325
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:41,236
But last night's encounter
came with a warning:

326
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:44,144
The Fallen
shall rise again.

327
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:46,349
"The Fallen."
Meaning what?

328
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:48,344
Origin: Unknown.

329
00:21:48,379 --> 00:21:49,158
They only recorded

330
00:21:49,193 --> 00:21:52,659
history of our race was contained
within the All-Spark,

331
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,591
lost with its destruction.

332
00:21:54,592 --> 00:21:55,612
Excuse me!

333
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,806
If this so-called "All-Spark",
now destroyed,

334
00:22:01,226 --> 00:22:03,830
why hasn't the enemy
left the planet

335
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:05,187
like you thought
they would?

336
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:07,621
Director Galloway,
our national security advisor

337
00:22:07,656 --> 00:22:09,504
the President
just appointed him liasion.

338
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,915
- It's too, uh...
- Well, I guess I didn't get that memo.

339
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:18,201
Forgive the interruption, General.
Excuse me, coming through.

340
00:22:18,995 --> 00:22:20,167
Excuse me,
excuse me...

341
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,051
After all the damage
in Shanghai,

342
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:25,394
the President is, uh...

343
00:22:25,756 --> 00:22:27,724
hard-pressed to say
the job's getting done.

344
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:34,650
Now under the classified
Alien Autobot Cooperation Act,

345
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:37,815
you are agreeing
to share your intel with us,

346
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,128
but not your advancements
in weaponry.

347
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:43,789
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

348
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:47,655
It would absolutely
bring more harm than good.

349
00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:50,742
But who are you
to judge what's best for us?

350
00:22:50,743 --> 00:22:52,904
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side-by-side

351
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,438
in the field
for two years.

352
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:57,603
We've shared blood, sweat
and precious metal together.

353
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,662
Soldier, you're paid to shoot;
not talk.

354
00:23:00,697 --> 00:23:01,950
Don't tell me.

355
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:03,143
And the, uh...

356
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:05,707
- The newest members of your team...
- Easy...

357
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:09,395
I understand they arrived here
after you sent a message into space.

358
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,416
An open invitation
to come to Earth,

359
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:13,115
embedded by no one
at the White House.

360
00:23:13,155 --> 00:23:15,281
Let me stop you
right there, Mr. Galloway.

361
00:23:15,316 --> 00:23:16,836
It was bedded
right here.

362
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:20,888
And in my experience, the judgement
of both Major Lennox and his team,

363
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:23,959
has always been
above reproach.

364
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,799
Well be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President

365
00:23:26,834 --> 00:23:28,876
that when our national security
is at stake,

366
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:32,492
no one
is above reproach.

367
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:35,677
Now, what do
we know so far?

368
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:38,283
We know
that the enemy leader,

369
00:23:38,435 --> 00:23:42,079
classified NBE-1,
AKA Megatron,

370
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,790
is resting in peace

371
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:45,828
at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyss,

372
00:23:45,863 --> 00:23:48,040
surrounded by
societs detection nets

373
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,452
and a full-time
submarine surveillance.

374
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:51,548
We also know that

375
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:54,892
the only remaining piece
of your alien All-Spark

376
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:56,967
is locked in
an electromagnetic vault,

377
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:00,547
here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.

378
00:24:01,621 --> 00:24:05,052
Decepticons,
we have located the shard.

379
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:06,487
And since no one...

380
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,738
can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

381
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:13,932
well, there--there's only
one clear conclusion:

382
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:17,180
You.
The Autobots.

383
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:20,110
They're here to hunt you.

384
00:24:20,612 --> 00:24:23,071
What's there to hunt for
on Earth besides that?

385
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:25,723
"The Fallen...
shall rise again"?

386
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,542
Sounds to me like
something's coming.

387
00:24:28,328 --> 00:24:31,295
So let me ask
if we ultimately conclude

388
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,181
that our national security
is best served

389
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:37,133
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

390
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:41,697
will you leave peacefully?

391
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:43,505
Freedom is your right.

392
00:24:43,877 --> 00:24:46,718
If you make that request,
we will honor it.

393
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:53,203
But before your president decides,
please ask him this.

394
00:24:53,587 --> 00:24:58,197
What if we leave
and you're wrong?

395
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,885
That's a good question.

396
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,972
Oh, my God,

397
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:14,311
just look at this place!

398
00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:17,654
I feel smarter already.

399
00:25:18,187 --> 00:25:19,843
Ron, can you smell it?

400
00:25:20,306 --> 00:25:22,435
Yes, smells
like $40,000 a year.

401
00:25:22,494 --> 00:25:23,645
Okay, cheapo.

402
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:27,032
Go ahead, we'll, uh...
We'll get your stuff.

403
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,406
Just go ahead
and check out your room.

404
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:33,486
[SONG: 21 Guns
BAND: Green Day]

405
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:38,516
- Hey.
- Hey.

406
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:40,551
You must be Sam, right?
I'm Leo.

407
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:41,251
Hey.

408
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:45,418
Uh, sorry, I already set up the crib.
Do you want this side or that side?

409
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,036
- That side.
- I already chose that side.

410
00:25:50,731 --> 00:25:52,831
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

411
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:55,513
Yeah, so you're trying to see
if I'm a normal guy.

412
00:25:55,543 --> 00:25:56,633
I'm trying to see
if you're a normal guy,

413
00:25:56,668 --> 00:25:58,361
balanced and medicated enough
for another coral space.

414
00:25:58,396 --> 00:25:59,812
Good personal hygiene
won't stab me in my sleep.

415
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:00,971
Good criminal record
won't steal anything.

416
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:02,466
- Including girlfriends.
- Especially girlfriends.

417
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:03,509
- You got a girlfriend?
- I do.

418
00:26:03,882 --> 00:26:06,857
- You?
- No, not a chance.

419
00:26:06,892 --> 00:26:08,012
- You're a techie?
- Hmm.

420
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:08,885
Sweet.

421
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,748
- Sharsky, Fassbiner, where we at?
- Server's almost online, Leo.

422
00:26:11,783 --> 00:26:13,037
It works up and running.

423
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,419
Beautiful; that's what
I like to hear.

424
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:15,975
- That's Sharsky, that's Spastik,
- Hey, dude.

425
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,460
my I.T. gurus.

426
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,659
Welcome to my empire, bro.
TheRealEffinDeal.com.

427
00:26:20,694 --> 00:26:21,753
That's me,
I'm sure you've heard of it.

428
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:24,467
- No, I haven't.
- Well, that sucks.

429
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:26,261
- What is all this for?
- See, look...

430
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:28,006
Call me gross,
I wanna be a baby billionaire.

Kitten calendars.

432
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:31,555
It's where it started.
Look at me now.

433
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:32,997
Got our dreams, bro.

434
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:36,953
Leo, we got some
bad news in Shanghai.

435
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:39,906
Post it, baby. Go, go, go!
FTJ, FTJ!

436
00:26:40,489 --> 00:26:41,755
- It's clean.
- What's FTJ?

437
00:26:41,987 --> 00:26:44,341
- Fuel the Jet, Fuel the Jet.
- FTJ, FTJ.

438
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:50,647
- This is it. Did you see that?
- Wow. Okay, this half of Shanghai

439
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:52,116
gets rigged
when China says gas leak.

440
00:26:52,151 --> 00:26:53,454
Don't believe the hype, bro.

441
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,841
Just like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.

442
00:26:58,314 --> 00:27:00,192
Yeah, I saw these robots
and they did this, like,

443
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:02,589
firing thing and they came down
and twisted this woman

444
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:03,949
- and she was like--
- Looks fake to me.

445
00:27:03,968 --> 00:27:07,015
Dude, it's not fake.
The Internet's pure true.

446
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,069
- Neither does it lie.
- It looks fake.

447
00:27:09,104 --> 00:27:11,147
No, man, I've seen them.
They are like these, uh, robots...

448
00:27:12,025 --> 00:27:14,858
Look, look, look, it's fake.
Anybody can do on any computer, okay?

449
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:16,501
And I wasn't, uh... there.

450
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:18,412
So I can't comment
or speculate.

451
00:27:18,447 --> 00:27:20,376
- Oh, no.
- "Comment and speculate"?

452
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:21,728
We're supposed
to go habitate?

453
00:27:21,768 --> 00:27:24,742
No, listen, okay.
Don't be sucking the sack, bro.

454
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:26,472
- Whose sack?
- Look, the ball sack.

455
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,719
- Dude, what kind of tool are you?
- Mainstream media sack.

456
00:27:29,803 --> 00:27:31,105
They're lying to us,
alright.

457
00:27:31,146 --> 00:27:33,261
- It's aliens, man.
- Okay, okay.

458
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:34,454
Follow me.

459
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,130
Uh-oh. Uh, Leo.
Bad news, we just got scooped.

460
00:27:38,165 --> 00:27:39,541
The video's already up
on GeoBoard.

461
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,989
Damn...
No!

462
00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:44,554
Robo-Warrior has a main competition,
our conspiracy step.

463
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:46,494
Effing was my effing idea.
He stole it.

464
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:49,034
He's been looking to my site
and thieving hits for ever!

465
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:50,333
By the way,
I read your file.

466
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,892
I'll pour, you'll pour...
We're gonna fix that, alright?

467
00:27:53,023 --> 00:27:54,063
You work for me, now.

468
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,549
I work for you now?

469
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,247
That's incredible.
It's first day of college,

470
00:27:59,282 --> 00:28:01,315

00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:42,207
Because your leaders believed
we brought vengeance upon your planet.

625
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:44,478
Perhaps,
they are right.

626
00:37:44,992 --> 00:37:47,931
That is why they must be
reminded by another human

627
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,746
of the trust we share.

628
00:37:50,115 --> 00:37:52,811
- This isn't my war.
- Not yet.

629
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,988
But I fear
it soon will be.

630
00:37:56,598 --> 00:37:59,998
Your world must not share
the same fate as Cybertron.

631
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:03,633
Whole generations lost.

632
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:10,319
I know and I-I want
to help you. I do.

633
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,804
But I'm not
some alien ambassador.

634
00:38:13,398 --> 00:38:15,510
You know, I'm a normal kid
with normal problems.

635
00:38:16,396 --> 00:38:17,987
I am where
I'm supposed to be.

636
00:38:21,443 --> 00:38:22,451
I'm sorry, I--

637
00:38:24,651 --> 00:38:25,762
I really am.

638
00:38:25,763 --> 00:38:29,780
Sam, fate rarely calls upon us
at a moment of our choosing.

639
00:38:30,597 --> 00:38:33,361
You're Optimus Prime.
You don't need me.

640
00:38:34,286 --> 00:38:37,573
We do...
more than you know.

641
00:38:39,302 --> 00:38:42,276
North Atlantic,
07:13 AM

642
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:12,172
USS Topeka SSN-754

643
00:39:12,207 --> 00:39:15,311
New contact, bearing 214
and possible hostile

644
00:39:15,346 --> 00:39:17,479
confirmed for
Project Beat Six drop-point.

645
00:39:17,514 --> 00:39:19,326
- What you got?
- Sue, pull five contacts.

646
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:21,262
5,000 feet. Diving fast.

647
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,600
There's something.
They dive that deep, that fast.

648
00:39:27,853 --> 00:39:30,725
- Man battle stations.
- Sealer One, man battle stations.

649
00:39:31,444 --> 00:39:33,740
Hell, not pull the rudder
or head two-thirds.

650
00:39:34,723 --> 00:39:35,711
Dive, Cookie.

651
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,568
The NEST protecting NBE-1
are screening, sir.

652
00:40:00,603 --> 00:40:02,698
That is 9,300 fathoms down.

653
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,212
- And no confirmed DSRVs on sight?
- None, sir.

654
00:40:05,247 --> 00:40:07,086
Then, people,
we've got a problem.

655
00:40:19,408 --> 00:40:21,420
Kill such little one.

656
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:30,629
Sea shard, make Energon.

657
00:40:43,434 --> 00:40:46,828
Prime sonar now holds six contacts
and they're coming up fast.

658
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:48,053
Man collisional arm...

659
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:51,741
...are 500 feet.

660
00:40:51,776 --> 00:40:52,503
Let's get out of here.

661
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:53,552
Angel Six,

662
00:40:53,592 --> 00:40:55,257
we got six hostiles
coming down.

663
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:04,982
- Collision imminent. Portside--
- 100 feet.

664
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,449
Brace for impact.

665
00:41:33,143 --> 00:41:36,147
Starscream, I'm home.

666
00:41:36,148 --> 00:41:38,682
Behold, Megatron,
I was so relieved

667
00:41:38,717 --> 00:41:41,005
to hear of your...
resurrection.

668
00:41:41,163 --> 00:41:44,942
You left me to die,
you pathetic insect!

669
00:41:45,365 --> 00:41:48,397
Only to help
spawn our new army,

670
00:41:48,568 --> 00:41:52,507
the Fallen decreased it,
after all, in your absence,

671
00:41:52,703 --> 00:41:54,956
someone had
to take command.

672
00:41:55,198 --> 00:41:55,873
You...

673
00:41:56,879 --> 00:41:58,487
are so disappointing.

674
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,251
Even in death,
there's no command but mine.

675
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,725
My master,
I failed you on Earth.

676
00:42:13,757 --> 00:42:16,296
The All-Spark is destroyed,

677
00:42:16,331 --> 00:42:19,601
and without it,
our race will perish.

678
00:42:20,224 --> 00:42:23,230
You have much to learn,
my disciple.

679
00:42:23,266 --> 00:42:25,862
The Cube
is merely a vessel.

680
00:42:25,892 --> 00:42:29,615
It's power, it's knowledge
can never be destroyed.

681
00:42:29,616 --> 00:42:32,653
It can only transform.

682
00:42:32,688 --> 00:42:36,011
- How is that possible?
- It has been absorbed

683
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:37,947
by the human child.

684
00:42:37,948 --> 00:42:43,110
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind.

685
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,852
Well then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body.

686
00:42:46,887 --> 00:42:48,836
And you will,
my apprentice.

687
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:53,855
In time. For millenia,
I have dreamed of my return

688
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:58,758
to that wretched planet,
where I too was once betrayed,

689
00:42:58,788 --> 00:43:02,715
by the Primes
I call my brothers.

690
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:10,257
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now only one remains.

691
00:43:10,259 --> 00:43:13,966
Optimus.
He protects the boy.

692
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:17,400
Then the boy
will lead us to him

693
00:43:17,401 --> 00:43:22,933
- and revenge will be ours.
- Yes.

694
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:27,945
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.

695
00:43:29,301 --> 00:43:33,215
Without more Energon,
hatchlings will keep dying.

696
00:43:38,475 --> 00:43:43,320
Space, time, gravity.

697
00:43:46,898 --> 00:43:49,049
- Thank you.
- Finish that for me.

698
00:43:49,554 --> 00:43:51,591
We're going
on a journey together,

699
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:52,822
you and I, today.

700
00:43:52,857 --> 00:43:57,698
All you, eager nubile young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.

701
00:43:58,713 --> 00:44:01,317
And I shall be your consort,
your guide,

702
00:44:01,831 --> 00:44:05,769
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.

703
00:44:08,374 --> 00:44:10,112
Welcome to Astronomy 101.

704
00:44:11,713 --> 00:44:15,537
For what do we know
about the stars?

705
00:44:15,771 --> 00:44:19,612
Virgo... the virgin.

706
00:44:20,453 --> 00:44:22,384
Orion, the great hunter.

707
00:44:22,385 --> 00:44:24,572
These are no mere
twinkling diamonds

708
00:44:24,632 --> 00:44:27,066
for lovely maidens
to wish upon.

709
00:44:27,087 --> 00:44:31,419
No, they are diamond,
filled with a throbbing,

710
00:44:31,454 --> 00:44:34,240
savage and hemped-up energy.

711
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:36,918
Behold the work of
Albert Einstein,

712
00:44:37,031 --> 00:44:39,635
a professor once,
like moi,

713
00:44:40,014 --> 00:44:42,018
- energy, in its mass temp--
- What are you doing?

714
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:43,021
Put your hand down,
put your hand down.

715
00:44:43,022 --> 00:44:45,501
Young man,
there are no questions

716
00:44:45,532 --> 00:44:47,595
until I've reached
the climax of my lecture.

717
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:48,939
I've just finished your book.
There's only one problem.

718
00:44:48,974 --> 00:44:49,974
Einstein's wrong.

719
00:44:51,685 --> 00:44:53,558
Energy doesn't go
mass times velocity light square

720
00:44:53,578 --> 00:44:54,866
in this dimension.
What about the other 17

721
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,332
while we're impossible
to give 17?

722
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:58,884
A clear example:

723
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,576
Come on, guys,
I can't be the only one in class--

724
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:23,248
Young man, I will not be punked
in front of the dean.

725
00:45:24,728 --> 00:45:29,681
No, this is my universe here.
Do you understand?

726
00:45:29,716 --> 00:45:33,336
I am the Alpha
and the Omega.

727
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:34,711
- Get out of my class.
- Yes, sir.

728
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:41,327
Any one else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

729
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:53,870
Hi, Bones.
Hi!

730
00:45:54,204 --> 00:45:56,762
Hi! Oh yes,
that's a good boy.

731
00:45:57,193 --> 00:45:58,972
Oh, what a good boy,
you are.

732
00:46:03,733 --> 00:46:04,910
Hey, Bones.

733
00:46:05,452 --> 00:46:06,764
You hungry?

734
00:46:14,226 --> 00:46:14,919
Here you go.

735
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:25,339
- Yes, Samuel.
- Hello? Mikaela.

736
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:28,207
I can't believe you're gonna
stand me up on our first web chat date.

737
00:46:28,242 --> 00:46:29,501
Something just happened
to me, okay?

738
00:46:29,531 --> 00:46:31,506
- Wait, you finally hit puberty?
- No, no, no,

739
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:32,527
Stop laughing.
This is serious.

740
00:46:32,557 --> 00:46:33,438
Okay, remember
I was telling you about

741
00:46:33,473 --> 00:46:35,461
my great-great-grandfather,
Archibald Witwicky?

742
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:36,294
Do you remember?

743
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:37,634
Watch where you're
supposed to go!

744
00:46:37,635 --> 00:46:40,027
Okay, remember
I was telling you about, okay...

745
00:46:40,062 --> 00:46:41,923
Can you stop...
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

746
00:46:41,959 --> 00:46:44,975
Mikaela, okay, my great-great-grandfather
went to this Arctic mission, right?

747
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,826
And he saw Megatron,
Megatron zapped him

748
00:46:46,856 --> 00:46:48,742
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols, okay.

749
00:46:48,777 --> 00:46:50,195
Well, now I'm seeing them too.
Excuse me.

750
00:46:50,213 --> 00:46:52,835
I just wrote a 903-page
Astronomy book at 32.6 seconds

751
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,332
and had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.

752
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:56,404
I am seeing symbols
ever since I--

753
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,594
- Since what?
- Ever since I touched the Cube sliver.

754
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:02,692
Do you have it?

755
00:47:03,165 --> 00:47:05,373
No, how about it's in
the shop safe? It's fine.

756
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:08,549
Mi--Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?
Don't touch it.

757
00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:09,597
I'm not gonna touch it,

758
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:12,411
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away,
no one knows where it is.

759
00:47:12,636 --> 00:47:13,958
But I do.

760
00:47:15,764 --> 00:47:17,739
You're hot,
but you're ain't too bright.

761
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:21,476
There we go.

762
00:47:24,287 --> 00:47:26,671
Oh, big son of a bitch!

763
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:31,379
What are you looking at,
Slobberpuss?

764
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:33,717
Ah, what the--

765
00:47:34,794 --> 00:47:36,426
This is a fricking
House of Horrors.

766
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:43,730
Hold on.

767
00:47:57,245 --> 00:47:59,095
Is that the best
you got, huh?

768
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:00,445
Is that the best
you can do?

769
00:48:02,134 --> 00:48:03,796
What are you doing here,
you little freak?

770
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,772
Ow, that's my eye,
you crazy bitch!

771
00:48:06,846 --> 00:48:08,267
You gotta talk now?

772
00:48:09,044 --> 00:48:12,484
I... I seek knowledge of the Cube.
The Fallen demands me.

773
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:13,301
What knowledge?

774
00:48:13,336 --> 00:48:15,311
You got the shot, I need the shot,
give me the shot, I need the shot.

775
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,191
Give me the shot,
they're gonna whack me,

776
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,512
I'm gonna be dead
without that shot.

777
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,651
Easy Warrior Goddess,
I'm just a little salvage scrap drone.

778
00:48:21,686 --> 00:48:23,536
- Then I'm your worst nightmare.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!

779
00:48:23,979 --> 00:48:24,729
Hey, hey!

780
00:48:25,009 --> 00:48:26,497
- What the hell was that?
- I'll tell you later,

781
00:48:26,547 --> 00:48:28,068
just not on
open phone line, okay?

782
00:48:28,107 --> 00:48:30,141
I'm gonna get on a plane right now.
I'll be there later this afternoon.

783
00:48:30,176 --> 00:48:31,323
Just be careful, Sam.

784
00:48:39,597 --> 00:48:42,368
And have any stranger giving you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

785
00:48:42,403 --> 00:48:43,832
Yeah, a large box!

786
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:45,574
- No.
- Good.

787
00:48:58,216 --> 00:49:00,852
Major, incoming SOS
from Autobots.

788
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:04,633
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity eastern United States, sir.

789
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:07,574
- Hansvin, how many?
- Unclear, sir.

790
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:09,462
Well, get clear.

791
00:49:14,114 --> 00:49:16,959
Autobots on the move.
Splitting them into two teams, sir.

792
00:49:16,994 --> 00:49:19,639
Unarching their course, somewhere heading
to New York and Philadelphia.

793
00:49:19,674 --> 00:49:23,245
Full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes!

794
00:49:33,585 --> 00:49:36,252
Flight Chairman
throughout West Beverly Hills.

795
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,083
M'amor (my lover), can I interest you
in Mayteam Zookeeper's Special?

796
00:49:41,165 --> 00:49:43,503
Extra large supertees
with every known animal as a topping.

797
00:49:43,504 --> 00:49:45,535
Basic lengths.
Only 18 inches of meat.

798
00:49:45,588 --> 00:49:47,685
Oh, so you're a vegetarian.
Alright, it's cool. I am too.

799
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:49,320
Is Sam home?

800
00:49:49,355 --> 00:49:52,610
Sam... I think he died but,
why don't we check?

801
00:49:53,216 --> 00:49:54,561
- Here we are.
- Hey.

802
00:49:55,176 --> 00:49:56,268
Have you had
a song stuck in yours?

803
00:49:56,269 --> 00:49:57,675
It's like the worst song ever,
but you can't help

804
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:59,287
whistle it or sing it.
It's like, repeats itself,

805
00:49:59,322 --> 00:50:01,483
repeats itself, repeats itself,
repeats itself, repeats itself,

806
00:50:01,484 --> 00:50:03,514
repeats itself...
Kitten calendar, kitten calendar,

807
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:04,573
- kitten calendar, kitten calendar,
- Dude,

808
00:50:04,608 --> 00:50:05,802
- kitten calendar, kitten calendar,
- What the F?

809
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:07,932
I know you're freaking out.
Don't freak out, don't freak out.

810
00:50:07,983 --> 00:50:10,850
Easy fix. Puzzle, code, in my head.
Now it's on the walls.

811
00:50:10,886 --> 00:50:11,626
Everything is good.

812
00:50:11,661 --> 00:50:12,551
This is the part that--

813
00:50:17,427 --> 00:50:18,493
Okay,
what were you saying?

814
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:21,929
Alice, I'm horrified you had
to see this. Let's go.

815
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,495
- Get out.
- What?

816
00:50:23,626 --> 00:50:25,627
Wait, wait, wait.
C-Can I just sit and watch?

817
00:50:25,662 --> 00:50:27,195
I-I'll eat my pizza quietly.

818
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:30,757
Sam, I knew there were
something special about you.

819
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:31,406
Really?

820
00:50:33,402 --> 00:50:35,449
And I know you know
what happens

821
00:50:35,714 --> 00:50:37,764
when two people
in the room get together...

822
00:50:38,853 --> 00:50:42,550
they're genuinely amazing...
in bed.

823
00:50:43,921 --> 00:50:45,293
- Thank you.
- No problem.

824
00:50:46,509 --> 00:50:49,144
Alright, listen, hold on.
Boundaries. Flight on the plane.

825
00:50:49,173 --> 00:50:50,488
Okay, I'm very ticklish.

826
00:50:50,523 --> 00:50:53,116
- You have the need, Sam. Relax!
- Why?

827
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:54,479
Oh, jeez!

828
00:50:55,738 --> 00:50:58,681
Uh, what about this economy?
It's crazy, isn't it?

829
00:51:01,662 --> 00:51:04,911
- You are very aggressive.
- Just relax.

830
00:51:04,946 --> 00:51:06,358
You want
some jerky meatloaf?

831
00:51:12,213 --> 00:51:13,117
Sam?

832
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:14,435
S u B Z   ~   V e R d i K  T
[Kept to prevent duplicate files]

833
00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:16,869
Mikaela.

834
00:51:17,015 --> 00:51:18,377
Is that your girlfriend?

835
00:51:19,668 --> 00:51:20,665
Ex.

836
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:26,595
Mikaela, wait...
I can explain every--

837
00:51:46,057 --> 00:51:47,678
Sam, your bed-buddy, Alice.

838
00:52:07,732 --> 00:52:08,220
What--

839
00:52:08,255 --> 00:52:09,322
- It's coming!
- This is an alien robot.

840
00:52:09,357 --> 00:52:10,940
- You gotta move. Just run.
- They're real?

841
00:52:17,823 --> 00:52:20,407
Oh my God, I can't believe
I once had sex with her in my dream.

842
00:52:20,442 --> 00:52:22,051
I can tell that you really
missed me a lot, Sam.

843
00:52:22,082 --> 00:52:23,138
Look, it's not my fault, okay?

844
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:25,306
Listen, listen.
I'm a victim.

845
00:52:25,326 --> 00:52:26,651
Oh, you were a victim?
Of what?

846
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:28,768
- Of what? A little 80-pound girl--
- Of--Of...

847
00:52:28,878 --> 00:52:30,537
It's like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox.

848
00:52:30,552 --> 00:52:31,933
You didn't have to put
your tongue in her mouth.

849
00:52:31,968 --> 00:52:32,938
- I didn't.
- You did.

850
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:35,391
Look, you ever had your stomach tounged
by a mountain ox with a 5-foot tong?

851
00:52:35,426 --> 00:52:37,067
It's not fun for me,
okay, Mikaela.

852
00:52:37,102 --> 00:52:40,751
And it smelled like--like diesel.
Like a diesel he dinged to it.

853
00:52:40,786 --> 00:52:42,241
You're such a little girl.

854
00:52:42,276 --> 00:52:44,324
You have ten seconds
of silence, right now.

855
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:45,600
I'm not talking to you
for ten seconds.

856
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,396
No, you can't give me the silence.
You know what?

857
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:50,031
I'm not talking to you for ten seconds.
You have three seconds left.

858
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,424
You know, what?
You can give me the silence you want,

859
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,160
all you want but you can't
give me the talking...

860
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,311
W-What were you gonna say?

861
00:52:54,346 --> 00:52:55,811
I hope you had a lot of fun
because this--

862
00:52:55,846 --> 00:52:57,047
This is over!

863
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,327
Did she finally led you
to orbits?

864
00:52:58,357 --> 00:53:00,938
You threw a broom?
She did it, she went in it?

865
00:53:02,643 --> 00:53:05,219
...gestating in that inside of you.
You're going right now, bro.

866
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,854
You need to vomit right now.
Yak it, yak it.

867
00:53:06,955 --> 00:53:08,946
- Right now!
- Who are you?

868
00:53:09,162 --> 00:53:11,282
I am the only one who
everybody can spit, okay?

869
00:53:11,317 --> 00:53:12,137
I'm the key to this.

870
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:13,895
Aliens; they want me
because of my site.

871
00:53:14,277 --> 00:53:14,830
Whoa!

872
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:26,068
Run!

873
00:53:30,291 --> 00:53:31,640
Mikaela!

874
00:53:49,342 --> 00:53:50,619
Watch out.
We get in.

875
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,747
It's a bomb!

876
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:03,926
We gotta get
that box.

877
00:54:07,673 --> 00:54:08,456
This way.

878
00:54:08,672 --> 00:54:10,652
Hey, let me out,
let me out!

879
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,591
Oh my God,
you know to hot-wire a car?

880
00:54:13,865 --> 00:54:15,375
- That's so hot.
- Drive, drive, drive.

881
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:16,616
She went there,
she went there!

882
00:54:20,277 --> 00:54:21,203
W-wait!

883
00:54:21,296 --> 00:54:22,383
They can....

884
00:54:26,153 --> 00:54:27,749
Cut, cut, cut.

885
00:54:34,595 --> 00:54:35,716
Oh God!

886
00:54:41,602 --> 00:54:42,998
Kiss this, bitch.

887
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:49,828
Drive, drive, drive,
drive, drive, drive.

888
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:54,795
Okay, so what else's
going right now, alright,

889
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:56,326
did you guys just mess
with the minor details?

890
00:54:58,818 --> 00:55:00,965
Thing you saw back there.
That was a little babe.

891
00:55:06,498 --> 00:55:08,890
Whoa!
Oh my God! Oh my God!

892
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:14,028
Sam!

893
00:55:18,604 --> 00:55:19,730
- Sam!
- Hold on!

894
00:55:20,214 --> 00:55:20,939
Hold on.

895
00:55:23,414 --> 00:55:24,422
Sam!

896
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:29,868
I don't want to die!
We're going to die! Oh my God!

897
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:56,856
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, jeez!

898
00:56:05,485 --> 00:56:07,225
Come here, boy.

899
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:09,841
Closer.

900
00:56:11,297 --> 00:56:11,764
Okay.

901
00:56:11,799 --> 00:56:15,406
- You remember me, don't you?
- I did what you said, okay?

902
00:56:16,567 --> 00:56:18,112
- Just don't hurt us.
- Shut up!

903
00:56:19,024 --> 00:56:19,920
Sam!

904
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:33,847
It feels good
to grab your first.

905
00:56:35,279 --> 00:56:40,089
I am going to kill you,
slowly, painfully.

906
00:56:40,124 --> 00:56:44,694
But first, we have
some delicate work to do.

907
00:56:48,357 --> 00:56:50,520
I could snap your ribs off.

908
00:56:50,882 --> 00:56:54,690
Doctor, examine
this alien specimen.

909
00:56:57,176 --> 00:56:58,795
Sick of your face now.

910
00:57:19,977 --> 00:57:21,790
Go that way.

911
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:31,241
A wormy that's crabby--

912
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:46,567
- Oh, there they are.
- That's what I'm seeing in my head.

913
00:57:46,602 --> 00:57:49,560
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

914
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:53,106
We must tear the brain!

915
00:57:55,501 --> 00:57:58,439
Brain?
What does he mean by my brain?

916
00:57:58,474 --> 00:58:00,563
Well, you have something
on your mind.

917
00:58:00,598 --> 00:58:02,946
- Something I need.
- Hold on. I know you're pissed.

918
00:58:02,966 --> 00:58:03,645
I know you're pissed.

919
00:58:03,675 --> 00:58:05,574
Because I tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

920
00:58:05,609 --> 00:58:07,154
Somebody tried to kill me,
I'd be upset too.

921
00:58:07,189 --> 00:58:09,685
I think that
we have an opportunity here

922
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,738
to start a new and--and
develop our relationship,

923
00:58:13,029 --> 00:58:15,325
and--and,
see where it leads us, okay?

924
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,567
So you just call
doctor inspection,

925
00:58:16,602 --> 00:58:18,249
I'll let you talk
in five seconds.

926
00:58:18,571 --> 00:58:19,211
W-Wait...

927
00:58:25,926 --> 00:58:26,772
Go, go.

928
00:58:30,985 --> 00:58:31,927
Go, go, go.

929
00:58:58,912 --> 00:58:59,907
Sam!

930
00:59:16,414 --> 00:59:17,285
Go, go, go, go!

931
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:19,362
Here he comes!

932
00:59:26,717 --> 00:59:29,796
Hide, Sam!
Hide.

933
00:59:38,521 --> 00:59:39,704
Weak.

934
00:59:42,093 --> 00:59:43,057
Puny.

935
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:44,543
Voiced-up.

936
00:59:48,913 --> 00:59:51,544
Junkyard drone.

937
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:54,302
Decepticons!

938
01:00:03,697 --> 01:00:05,700
Come here, boy.

939
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:39,097
There is another source of Energon
hidden on this planet.

940
01:00:39,132 --> 01:00:41,210
The boy can lead us to it.

941
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:47,150
Optimus!

942
01:01:00,445 --> 01:01:05,954
Is the future of our race
not worth a single human life?

943
01:01:05,955 --> 01:01:07,112
Op, get up!

944
01:01:07,113 --> 01:01:09,568
You'll never stop at one.

945
01:01:10,881 --> 01:01:12,812
I'll take you all alive.

946
01:01:54,574 --> 01:01:56,395
Sam, where are you?

947
01:02:00,623 --> 01:02:03,610
You are so weak.

948
01:02:27,733 --> 01:02:32,230
At last, Prime is dead.

949
01:02:40,447 --> 01:02:42,750
Sam, run.

950
01:02:55,302 --> 01:02:56,949
Autobots, attack!

951
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,318
Bumblebee,
get them out of here.

952
01:03:17,266 --> 01:03:18,308
This is Lennox.

953
01:03:31,203 --> 01:03:32,600
That went well.

954
01:03:33,321 --> 01:03:34,999
Lost the boy, Master.

955
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:37,458
The Autobots must be shielding
the signals.

956
01:03:37,932 --> 01:03:40,241
- I can't even rely on you.
- Sorry. No.

957
01:03:40,271 --> 01:03:42,441
What a simple insect!

958
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,638
- What insect amongst severed billion--
- Shut up.

959
01:03:48,268 --> 01:03:49,914
It could be anywhere.

960
01:03:50,606 --> 01:03:54,103
Then we will force them
to find him for us.

961
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:57,383
It's time for the world
to know of our presence.

962
01:03:57,677 --> 01:04:00,909
No more disguises,
no mercy!

963
01:04:01,211 --> 01:04:04,833
Time has come
for my master's arrival.

964
01:04:08,704 --> 01:04:12,195
Decepticons, mobilise.

965
01:04:12,196 --> 01:04:14,202
It is time.

966
01:04:28,777 --> 01:04:31,317
Oh, that single's good!

967
01:04:31,518 --> 01:04:33,831
Speaking French
is so exciting.

968
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:35,689
Oh God,
who is this?

969
01:04:37,643 --> 01:04:40,650
Hello-- I mean,
uh, bon--bonswa (good afternoon)!

970
01:04:41,817 --> 01:04:43,800
What?
Who is this?

971
01:04:45,171 --> 01:04:46,671
Oh, for Pete's sakes.

972
01:04:46,865 --> 01:04:49,737
I'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth breathing.

973
01:04:51,175 --> 01:04:53,037
New York City

974
01:05:30,019 --> 01:05:31,135
Oh, jeez.

975
01:05:31,326 --> 01:05:33,930
You are invading my space.
I'm gonna have to drop you.

976
01:05:33,965 --> 01:05:35,105
Would you get out
of here?

977
01:05:35,338 --> 01:05:37,108
Might freak me out.

978
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:39,037
We're gonna try
new things.

979
01:05:39,087 --> 01:05:40,660
Looks like Candian goosepoop.

980
01:05:43,101 --> 01:05:44,215
It's nasty.

981
01:05:44,697 --> 01:05:47,685
US Fleet 2, North Atlantic

982
01:05:49,575 --> 01:05:50,962
That's fine, 1-2-5.

983
01:06:56,594 --> 01:07:00,131
Revenge is mine.

984
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:21,129
Pentagon,
Washington D.C.

985
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:28,647
...port accident
for a terrorist attack, or worse.

986
01:07:28,682 --> 01:07:30,772
Negative.
NORAD confirmed

987
01:07:30,823 --> 01:07:33,287
project came
from beyond our atmosphere

988
01:07:33,288 --> 01:07:35,512
inbound at 30,000 knot.

989
01:07:49,419 --> 01:07:52,688
Citizens
of the human hive,

990
01:07:53,019 --> 01:07:56,654
your leaders
have withheld the truth.

991
01:07:56,743 --> 01:08:00,706
You are not alone
in this universe.

992
01:08:00,741 --> 01:08:03,915
We have lived among you,
hidden...

993
01:08:05,425 --> 01:08:07,250
but no more.

994
01:08:07,613 --> 01:08:09,514
As you've seen,

995
01:08:09,783 --> 01:08:12,654
we can destroy
your cities at will.

996
01:08:14,636 --> 01:08:18,122
Unless you turn over
this boy.

997
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:24,849
If you resist us,

998
01:08:25,109 --> 01:08:29,530
we will destroy the world,
as you know it.

999
01:08:29,829 --> 01:08:31,642
What we're hearing from
the German government is that

1000
01:08:31,692 --> 01:08:34,507
the world broadcast
is a satellite hacking.

1001
01:08:34,508 --> 01:08:35,916
- NEST Team, New Jersey
- The military has just told us

1002
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,061
they have assumed
Condition Delta,

1003
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:40,864
which is the highest level
we've been at since 9/11.

1004
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:42,923
President Obama
is being flown to a bunker,

1005
01:08:42,924 --> 01:08:44,620
somewhere in the middle
of the United States.

1006
01:08:44,655 --> 01:08:47,436
in the phase of the worst
simultaneous attacks ever

1007
01:08:47,471 --> 01:08:48,677
around the globe.

1008
01:08:48,918 --> 01:08:52,735
The aircraft carrier, USS Roosevelt,
goes down off the East Coast

1009
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:54,326
all hands lost.

1010
01:08:54,427 --> 01:08:57,956
Worldwide casualties
are in the neighbourhood of 7,000,

1011
01:08:57,987 --> 01:08:59,584
but that number
could implode.

1012
01:08:59,604 --> 01:09:00,840
It's still too early to tell.

1013
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,097
What we need to ask now,
is who and why.

1014
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:06,089
The FBI is still trying
to locate the boy, Sam Witwicky.

1015
01:09:06,124 --> 01:09:08,926
Within deep, they have information
about this.

1016
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:11,379
The FBI, CIA and Interpol

1017
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:14,543
are all seeking the cooperation
of worldwide law enforcements.

1018
01:09:14,575 --> 01:09:15,763
Hey bro, you need
to listen to this, man.

1019
01:09:15,792 --> 01:09:17,725
- You gotta check this out.
- Once they have a traffic camera

1020
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,678
- spotting a Sam Witwicky.
- They have a picture of me, man.

1021
01:09:19,714 --> 01:09:23,383
We're dead, bro.
FBI, CIA, we're wanted fugitives now.

1022
01:09:23,438 --> 01:09:25,122
I just need you to focus
just one minute, man.

1023
01:09:25,157 --> 01:09:26,920
This thing is blowing
to a whole another level, alright.

1024
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:28,405
- You know one thing--
- Remove this thing.

1025
01:09:28,406 --> 01:09:29,492
They can track us.
Do you see this?

1026
01:09:29,527 --> 01:09:30,232
What?

1027
01:09:32,665 --> 01:09:33,828
They can track us?

1028
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:35,582
Like satellite-track us?

1029
01:09:35,775 --> 01:09:37,794
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay,
I'm not even with you guys.

1030
01:09:37,825 --> 01:09:40,398
Technically, I'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping. Enough--

1031
01:09:40,428 --> 01:09:41,692
Yo, Leo!

1032
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:44,124
This thing's gonna give me
a heart attack, I swear.

1033
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:46,156
- That's 'cause you was a wuss.
- You did force me into the car, right?

1034
01:09:46,191 --> 01:09:47,524
- So...
- Oh, I think you scared.

1035
01:09:47,559 --> 01:09:48,494
Hey, Mudflap.

1036
01:09:48,704 --> 01:09:50,115
What are we going to do
with this shrimp taco?

1037
01:09:50,155 --> 01:09:51,729
Just pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

1038
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,056
and nobody gonna know nothing,
y'know I mean?

1039
01:09:53,091 --> 01:09:55,068
- Wait, now my trunk--
- Yo, bumper cars,

1040
01:09:55,069 --> 01:09:56,740
Check it out.
I'm hearing you, okay?

1041
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:58,541
I'm right here
and I can hear you.

1042
01:09:58,571 --> 01:10:01,146
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

1043
01:10:01,165 --> 01:10:02,609
I've had a hell of a day.

1044
01:10:03,674 --> 01:10:06,030
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

1045
01:10:06,031 --> 01:10:07,159
Go whine
to your boyfriend.

1046
01:10:07,164 --> 01:10:08,863
Listen Sam, I know
what I'm gonna do, man.

1047
01:10:08,898 --> 01:10:09,987
Look, I'm just going to go
to the authorities

1048
01:10:10,029 --> 01:10:11,526
and tell them the truth.
Like I had nothing to do with this,

1049
01:10:11,545 --> 01:10:12,377
- I'm an accomplice.
- Hey, hey!

1050
01:10:12,412 --> 01:10:14,021
You wanted this, right?
You wanted the real deal?

1051
01:10:14,062 --> 01:10:16,158
'Cause that's what this is.
Wake up! You're in the middle of it.

1052
01:10:16,193 --> 01:10:18,158
You wanna run, go ahead,
no one's stopping you.

1053
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:20,671
Stop complaining.

1054
01:10:57,354 --> 01:10:58,765
What is the meaning
of this?

1055
01:10:59,201 --> 01:11:01,193
You dare
point your gun at me?

1056
01:11:01,194 --> 01:11:05,025
You want a piece of me?
I will tear you apart!

1057
01:11:06,855 --> 01:11:09,190
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

1058
01:11:09,225 --> 01:11:10,931
- Tell them to lower the weapons.
- Tell them first.

1059
01:11:10,962 --> 01:11:13,070
- Tell them to lower the weapons!
- Major, there's nothing I can do.

1060
01:11:13,109 --> 01:11:13,886
Talk to him.

1061
01:11:14,188 --> 01:11:16,040
US teams deactivated, Major.

1062
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:19,182
You are decease
anti-Decepticon operations,

1063
01:11:19,212 --> 01:11:21,585
and return to Diego Garcia.
Any further orders?

1064
01:11:21,616 --> 01:11:23,840
No. We take our orders
direct from Chairman Morshower.

1065
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,056
Well, I'll see your chairman
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1066
01:11:26,086 --> 01:11:28,415
but I will raise you
a President of the United States.

1067
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:30,087
I have operational command now.

1068
01:11:30,122 --> 01:11:32,456
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

1069
01:11:32,491 --> 01:11:34,178
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

1070
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:37,650
The secret is out.
This is our war now.

1071
01:11:37,846 --> 01:11:39,527
And we will win it
as we always have,

1072
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:41,802
with a coordinated
military strategy.

1073
01:11:41,837 --> 01:11:44,480
This fool
is terribly misinformed.

1074
01:11:44,672 --> 01:11:46,239
You're gonna get every assets
that you've got.

1075
01:11:46,275 --> 01:11:47,978
What we need is
to draw our battle plans.

1076
01:11:48,162 --> 01:11:50,355
What we explore every possible,
diplomatic solution.

1077
01:11:50,356 --> 01:11:51,770
Like what:
Handing over the kid?

1078
01:11:53,157 --> 01:11:54,850
All options
are being considered.

1079
01:11:55,634 --> 01:11:57,610
Whatever the Decepticons
are after,

1080
01:11:57,982 --> 01:11:59,432
this is just the start.

1081
01:11:59,553 --> 01:12:01,175
Wait, there is no negotiating
with them.

1082
01:12:01,196 --> 01:12:02,849
I'm ordering you
to stand down.

1083
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:04,279
You won't be needing this
any more.

1084
01:12:04,662 --> 01:12:06,687
Get your assets
back to base.

1085
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:09,805
Take that scrap metal
back to Diego Garcia.

1086
01:12:11,669 --> 01:12:12,020
Let's go.

1087
01:12:13,749 --> 01:12:15,428
I really don't
like that dude.

1088
01:12:16,021 --> 01:12:17,885
He's a asshole.

1089
01:12:18,147 --> 01:12:20,564
Autobots,
report to hangar for transport.

1090
01:12:20,767 --> 01:12:23,395
Ironhide,
we should leave this planet.

1091
01:12:23,537 --> 01:12:25,953
That's not what
Optimus would want.

1092
01:12:45,165 --> 01:12:46,886
There's nothing
that you could have done.

1093
01:12:51,721 --> 01:12:53,787
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1094
01:12:56,966 --> 01:12:59,773
Bee, if you hate me,
I understand.

1095
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:08,799
I messed up.

1096
01:13:10,169 --> 01:13:11,209
I'm sorry.

1097
01:13:12,819 --> 01:13:16,962
- Young fella, you are...
- ...person I care about most in my life.

1098
01:13:16,998 --> 01:13:19,802
- If there's anything you need...
- I won't be far away.

1099
01:13:22,068 --> 01:13:23,454
He's dead
because of me.

1100
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:25,945
He came in
to protect me instead.

1101
01:13:26,286 --> 01:13:28,970
There's some things
you just can't change.

1102
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:30,480
So this sacrifice was...

1103
01:13:30,736 --> 01:13:33,214
will not have been in vain,
hallelujah!

1104
01:13:34,685 --> 01:13:36,510
We make it right
when we turn myself in.

1105
01:13:36,754 --> 01:13:38,732
But we,
we've got to stick together.

1106
01:13:43,409 --> 01:13:45,129
You're not gonna do that.

1107
01:13:46,658 --> 01:13:47,394
Yes, I am.

1108
01:13:51,525 --> 01:13:54,211
Everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

1109
01:13:54,212 --> 01:13:55,443
In one day.

1110
01:13:58,148 --> 01:13:59,586
- You two.
- Huh?

1111
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,316
Hey, you know the glyphs?

1112
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:03,867
The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head.

1113
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:06,460
That's old school, yo.

1114
01:14:06,461 --> 01:14:08,634
That's like--
That's Cybertonian.

1115
01:14:08,674 --> 01:14:10,240
Oh, that's some
serious stuff in there.

1116
01:14:10,241 --> 01:14:11,897
They gotta mean something,
like a message...

1117
01:14:11,933 --> 01:14:13,285
or, like a--
like a map!

1118
01:14:13,321 --> 01:14:14,863
Like a map
to an Energon source.

1119
01:14:14,876 --> 01:14:15,629
Can you read this?

1120
01:14:16,168 --> 01:14:17,464
- Read? Nah.
- You see that?

1121
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:20,049
No, we--we don't really do
much reading.

1122
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:21,343
- Not so much.
- Well if you can't read it,

1123
01:14:21,363 --> 01:14:22,281
we gotta find
somebody who can.

1124
01:14:22,311 --> 01:14:24,366
Oh, look, who came
stashing and back.

1125
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:26,056
Hair grown like a chip,
there, look it.

1126
01:14:26,091 --> 01:14:28,230
I had a bit of a mild
panic attack earlier, alright?

1127
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:29,190
That's 'cause
you're a pussy.

1128
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:31,238
I think I'm allowed that
considering what I've been through

1129
01:14:31,268 --> 01:14:32,796
and... I heard
you have a problem.

1130
01:14:32,815 --> 01:14:34,448
I think I know someone
who can help.

1131
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:37,037
- Who?
- Robo-Warrior.

1132
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:40,670
[SONG: New Divide
BAND: Linkin Park]

1133
01:14:40,813 --> 01:14:42,077
This guy, Robo-Warrior...

1134
01:14:42,117 --> 01:14:44,669
Everything about anything alien,
he's supposed to know.

1135
01:14:44,704 --> 01:14:46,071
One time
we revenge hacked his site

1136
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:50,746
and maybe, I saw some of your, uh...
alien drawings or whatever.

1137
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:03,512
This is it.

1138
01:15:04,126 --> 01:15:05,864
Yep, deli. Good front.

1139
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:08,736
Alright, wait here.
I'll give you the go/no go, alright?

1140
01:15:09,584 --> 01:15:11,377
- Number 42, we got your--

1141
01:15:16,946 --> 01:15:18,735
- I told you to secure the locks,

1142
01:15:18,736 --> 01:15:20,116
in the frying
and then smoke it.

1143
01:15:20,165 --> 01:15:22,011
Ma, you want me
to cut my handle off or what?

1144
01:15:22,046 --> 01:15:25,235
- You order a terrible piece of fishing.
- I'm like a ninja, with a blade.

1145
01:15:25,255 --> 01:15:26,318
Get out of here!

1146
01:15:26,353 --> 01:15:28,438
Hey, Sam!
Watch your reach, huh?

1147
01:15:28,608 --> 01:15:30,076
Take a number,
young man.

1148
01:15:30,671 --> 01:15:31,837
Robo-Warrior.

1149
01:15:33,832 --> 01:15:34,544
Know him?

1150
01:15:34,867 --> 01:15:36,009
I never heard of him.

1151
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:38,320
You never heard of
TheRealEffingDeal.com?

1152
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:41,160
You must be talking about
that amateur blog operation

1153
01:15:41,195 --> 01:15:43,371
with GameBoy level security.

1154
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,575
Robo-Warrior.

1155
01:15:45,358 --> 01:15:47,400
It's him. It's him!
That's the guy right there.

1156
01:15:47,435 --> 01:15:48,364
That's him.

1157
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:50,382
No.

1158
01:15:51,386 --> 01:15:52,420
You gotta be kidding me.

1159
01:15:52,421 --> 01:15:54,923
Alright, meat store's closed.
Everybody out!

1160
01:15:54,924 --> 01:15:56,056
Go, right now!

1161
01:15:57,811 --> 01:15:59,232
Wait a minute,
you know this guy?

1162
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:00,715
- We're old friends.
- Whoa, friend,

1163
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:03,429
you are the case
that shut down Sector 7.

1164
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,970
Got the tie-bash
disbandment,

1165
01:16:05,005 --> 01:16:08,321
no more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.

1166
01:16:08,356 --> 01:16:11,412
All 'cause of you,
and your little criminal girlfriend.

1167
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:12,981
Look at her now,
so mature.

1168
01:16:12,982 --> 01:16:15,793
Moron, where's the wifresh?

1169
01:16:15,793 --> 01:16:17,733
Don't catch me
with the thing.

1170
01:16:17,793 --> 01:16:19,112
- Yakov!
- What?

1171
01:16:19,294 --> 01:16:21,374
You don't get Christmas bonus
just standing around.

1172
01:16:21,497 --> 01:16:23,345
You want those new teeth
you saw in SkyMall?

1173
01:16:23,584 --> 01:16:25,464
- It's my dream.
- Help around.

1174
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:28,149
- You live with your momma?
- No, my momma lives with me,

1175
01:16:28,179 --> 01:16:28,775
it's a big difference.

1176
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:30,739
They got your face
all over the news, alien boy.

1177
01:16:30,774 --> 01:16:32,897
- Yeah, I know.
- And NBE-1, still kicking, huh?

1178
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:34,221
How did that happen?

1179
01:16:34,438 --> 01:16:36,326
Don't answer.
I don't know what you're hiding,

1180
01:16:36,361 --> 01:16:37,806
but I don't want anything
to do with it

1181
01:16:37,846 --> 01:16:40,175
so, goodbye, you never saw me.
I got bagels to schmidt.

1182
01:16:40,311 --> 01:16:41,878
Well, give me 5 seconds.

1183
01:16:41,879 --> 01:16:43,366
Look, hold on,
I need your help.

1184
01:16:43,401 --> 01:16:45,827
Really,
you need my help?

1185
01:16:46,117 --> 01:16:46,679
I need--

1186
01:16:46,714 --> 01:16:48,977
Look, I am slowly
losing my mind, okay?

1187
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:50,881
I had a little Crabbot
placed the device

1188
01:16:50,911 --> 01:16:52,435
deep into the soft tissues
of my brain,

1189
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:54,153
and started projecting
little alien symbols

1190
01:16:54,188 --> 01:16:55,147
like a whole freaking movie

1191
01:16:55,182 --> 01:16:56,932
and on top of that,
I'm a wanted fugitive.

1192
01:16:56,967 --> 01:16:58,114
So you think
you got it rough?

1193
01:16:58,125 --> 01:17:00,298
You said it projected images
of your brain?

1194
01:17:00,299 --> 01:17:01,125
Right.

1195
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:03,058
Meat locker, now!

1196
01:17:03,675 --> 01:17:04,934
- Dead pigs.
- Yuck.

1197
01:17:04,948 --> 01:17:06,903
What you're about to see
is top secret.

1198
01:17:07,868 --> 01:17:09,780
Do not tell my mother.

1199
01:17:10,896 --> 01:17:12,198
Dead pigs, swine flu.

1200
01:17:12,233 --> 01:17:13,023
- Not good.
- Now you know.

1201
01:17:13,215 --> 01:17:14,953
Next time, you eat
a goat or a pig.

1202
01:17:14,954 --> 01:17:16,205
There's a story
behind this.

1203
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:17,555
Yeah,
there's a story.

1204
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:19,823
<i>...you're saying
you believe in aliens?</i>

1205
01:17:19,858 --> 01:17:21,183
Okay, files, files.

1206
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:22,967
We're talking about symbols.

1207
01:17:23,686 --> 01:17:26,049
Hey! Still radioactive.
Hands off.

1208
01:17:27,214 --> 01:17:28,609
Okay, Cube-brain.

1209
01:17:29,662 --> 01:17:31,714
Any of these look like
the symbols you saw?

1210
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:32,934
Where did you get these?

1211
01:17:33,405 --> 01:17:34,952
Before I got fired.

1212
01:17:34,955 --> 01:17:37,508
I coached S-7's
scrawny, drooly...

1213
01:17:37,543 --> 01:17:42,575
75 years of alien research
which points to one inescapable fact:

1214
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:47,199
The Transformers;
they've been here a long, long time.

1215
01:17:47,235 --> 01:17:47,877
How do I know?

1216
01:17:49,276 --> 01:17:51,241
Archaeologists found
these unexplained markings

1217
01:17:51,277 --> 01:17:53,712
and ancient runes
all over the world.

1218
01:17:54,053 --> 01:17:56,069
China, Egypt, Greece.

1219
01:17:56,883 --> 01:17:58,331
Shot at 1932.

1220
01:17:58,672 --> 01:18:00,340
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1221
01:18:00,531 --> 01:18:02,820
- Yeah.
- Same ones over here, right?

1222
01:18:03,534 --> 01:18:07,677
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same thing?

1223
01:18:09,093 --> 01:18:10,255
Aliens.

1224
01:18:10,497 --> 01:18:12,193
And I think
some of them stayed.

1225
01:18:12,228 --> 01:18:13,122
Check this out.

1226
01:18:13,283 --> 01:18:15,201
Project Black Knife.

1227
01:18:15,532 --> 01:18:19,247
Robots, in disguise.
Hiding here.

1228
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:20,223
All along.

1229
01:18:20,254 --> 01:18:23,347
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1230
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:27,035
I pleaded on my knees
with S-7 to investigate it

1231
01:18:27,055 --> 01:18:30,642
but they said
the readings were infantesimal.

1232
01:18:30,678 --> 01:18:33,336
That I was obsessed!

1233
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:34,957
Me, can you imagine that?

1234
01:18:36,012 --> 01:18:38,356
Megatron said that there was
another Energon source here.

1235
01:18:38,391 --> 01:18:40,161
- On Earth? On another source?
- On Earth.

1236
01:18:40,359 --> 01:18:41,402
Okay,
and that these symbols,

1237
01:18:41,443 --> 01:18:42,998
the maps in my head
would lead him there.

1238
01:18:43,263 --> 01:18:45,013
Should you talk
to your Autobot friends?

1239
01:18:45,036 --> 01:18:46,245
No, no, no,
the source is before.

1240
01:18:46,285 --> 01:18:48,909
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them. It's before them.

1241
01:18:49,184 --> 01:18:50,681
- So it comes before that.
- Correct.

1242
01:18:51,496 --> 01:18:52,609
Well then, report...

1243
01:18:52,911 --> 01:18:54,663
Unless we can talk
to a Decepticon.

1244
01:18:55,176 --> 01:18:57,307
I mean, I'm not on
speed terms or whatever...

1245
01:18:57,336 --> 01:18:58,807
Actually, I am.

1246
01:19:03,388 --> 01:19:04,414
Let me out!

1247
01:19:05,227 --> 01:19:07,089
- It could be a little bit sad.
- Open it.

1248
01:19:08,987 --> 01:19:11,540
I'm gonna so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1249
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:12,669
Behave.

1250
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:14,212
- What is it, a Decepticon?
- Yeah.

1251
01:19:14,477 --> 01:19:16,360
- Can you train him?
- Tried to.

1252
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:19,761
I spent my whole adult life,
coming a plan of aliens.

1253
01:19:19,796 --> 01:19:21,534
- You're very furious--
- And you're carrying it around

1254
01:19:21,569 --> 01:19:23,088
what are you supposed to make
a little chihuahua.

1255
01:19:24,008 --> 01:19:26,130
Wanna throw it down,
you pubic fro-head?

1256
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,145
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your eye.

1257
01:19:29,597 --> 01:19:31,016
You know,
but if you're a good boy,

1258
01:19:31,273 --> 01:19:33,033
then I'm not gonna torch
your other eye.

1259
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:34,405
Okay?
I'm not gonna torch it.

1260
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,414
Just tell me
what these symbols are.

1261
01:19:36,887 --> 01:19:37,520
Please.

1262
01:19:39,103 --> 01:19:39,805
Okay.

1263
01:19:41,121 --> 01:19:44,080
Oh, I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1264
01:19:45,446 --> 01:19:47,462
I don't read it, but uh,
these guys...

1265
01:19:47,939 --> 01:19:50,678
Where the frick did you find
photos of these guys?

1266
01:19:50,912 --> 01:19:51,886
- Is this them?
- Yeah.

1267
01:19:51,927 --> 01:19:54,602
Sakers, pal.
Oldest of the old.

1268
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:56,296
Oh, they've been here for
thousands of years,

1269
01:19:56,326 --> 01:19:57,541
looking for something.

1270
01:19:57,577 --> 01:19:59,395
I don't know what,
nobody tells me nothing.

1271
01:19:59,431 --> 01:20:01,584
Oh, they'll translate
those symbols for ya.

1272
01:20:01,746 --> 01:20:03,247
And I know
where to find them.

1273
01:20:03,282 --> 01:20:04,047
Show us.

1274
01:20:09,152 --> 01:20:10,977
Closest one's
in Washington.

1275
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:16,440
Smithsonian
Air and Space Museum.

1276
01:20:16,443 --> 01:20:18,780
Land of dreams
in there.

1277
01:20:19,372 --> 01:20:21,311
All I ever want to be
was an astronaut.

1278
01:20:23,112 --> 01:20:24,740
- Hold those.
- What is that?

1279
01:20:26,025 --> 01:20:26,640
What?

1280
01:20:26,641 --> 01:20:28,143
I wear them
when I'm in the funk.

1281
01:20:29,299 --> 01:20:32,327
So does Jeamby, Cheater.
It's a baseball thing.

1282
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,740
Okay. Once you synchronize,
shop-mind and empty bladder

1283
01:20:35,774 --> 01:20:38,645
you get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1284
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:39,694
Here, take one
of these pills.

1285
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:40,592
Slip it
under your tongue,

1286
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:42,893
it's a high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1287
01:20:42,928 --> 01:20:44,725
Fools the polygraph,
everytime.

1288
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:46,702
Okay, now let's get this show
on the road.

1289
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:49,106
Whoa, no, listen.
I can't do this.

1290
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:50,332
I'm not some
alien bounty hunter, alright?

1291
01:20:50,367 --> 01:20:51,692
'cause I'm not gonna do this.
Guards have guns,

1292
01:20:51,724 --> 01:20:53,346
- I don't want to die.
- Kid, kid, kid, kid, kid, kid.

1293
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:56,494
You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.

1294
01:20:56,554 --> 01:20:59,724
Now look into my eyes,
and tighten up that spare tank.

1295
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:01,780
<i>The museum
is now closing.</i>

1296
01:21:02,173 --> 01:21:03,549
Papa, bad news, bro.

1297
01:21:03,589 --> 01:21:05,557
Ran out of toilet paper,
you got any out here?

1298
01:21:05,587 --> 01:21:07,752
- Please tell me you--
- Sir, I suggest you get in there.

1299
01:21:07,787 --> 01:21:09,249
The museum is closed.

1300
01:21:09,284 --> 01:21:11,948
Listen man, I understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

1301
01:21:11,949 --> 01:21:13,779
Dumper-dumper.
I gotta go, alright?

1302
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:16,434
Sir, you are a grown naked man
around showing...

1303
01:21:16,735 --> 01:21:19,386
- Pull your pants up and exit--
- I'm not going anywhere.

1304
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:25,606
You got that paper,
right, sir?

1305
01:21:25,831 --> 01:21:26,930
You should be embarassed.

1306
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:28,616
This a family museum, sir.

1307
01:21:47,262 --> 01:21:48,882
What is going on here?

1308
01:21:48,917 --> 01:21:50,819
How many times
can you get tased in the nuts?

1309
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:53,364
So you covered the gates,
huh, you know.

1310
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:55,853
You're an amateur man,
a rank amateur.

1311
01:21:59,419 --> 01:22:01,337
There's now five guards.
Five guards.

1312
01:22:01,547 --> 01:22:02,980
- You get this stuff and get out of here.
- Give me a second.

1313
01:22:03,277 --> 01:22:04,592
I gotta get
the tracker, alright.

1314
01:22:05,247 --> 01:22:07,485
- Be good.
- I'm claustrophobic.

1315
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:26,650
Look, look.
Follow him, follow him.

1316
01:22:26,685 --> 01:22:27,504
He knows
where he's going.

1317
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:34,604
- He knows something.
- What?

1318
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:35,849
He knows something!

1319
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:43,327
- You got what I got?
- Yeah.

1320
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,290
Blackbird.

1321
01:22:47,566 --> 01:22:49,078
There he is.

1322
01:22:49,113 --> 01:22:52,947
This guy's a legend,
like--like the Chairman of the Board.

1323
01:22:52,982 --> 01:22:54,709
Yo, freshman,
put the shard.

1324
01:22:55,202 --> 01:22:57,293
And watch
the magic happen.

1325
01:23:04,351 --> 01:23:06,410
Oh shit,
it's a Decepticon!

1326
01:23:06,853 --> 01:23:08,489
- Decepticon?
- What is it?

1327
01:23:09,061 --> 01:23:10,442
Find the main tail!

1328
01:23:23,076 --> 01:23:25,880
What sort of hideous
mosalleem is this?

1329
01:23:27,454 --> 01:23:30,726
Semi pulls and days,
show yourselves!

1330
01:23:30,727 --> 01:23:32,974
Or suffer my infinite wrath!

1331
01:23:34,391 --> 01:23:37,142
W-wait, old spinal called
based organisms.

1332
01:23:38,314 --> 01:23:39,153
Bugger!

1333
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:44,669
Behold the eternal glory
of Jetfire!

1334
01:23:44,704 --> 01:23:46,817
Prepare
for a systems' override.

1335
01:23:46,852 --> 01:23:48,331
I tell you, this guy
did not age well.

1336
01:23:48,366 --> 01:23:51,224
- He either heard it.
- Command these doors to open.

1337
01:23:51,506 --> 01:23:52,512
Fire!

1338
01:23:52,755 --> 01:23:55,387
Oh, I said, fire!

1339
01:23:56,439 --> 01:23:57,632
Bollocks.

1340
01:23:57,667 --> 01:23:59,858
Break that,
these worthless--

1341
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:01,260
Wait a second.

1342
01:24:01,604 --> 01:24:05,129
Itching, wretching,
rust in my arse.

1343
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:08,449
Oh, the museum's gonna be
very angry.

1344
01:24:08,484 --> 01:24:10,800
Very angry.
We gotta catch that plane!

1345
01:24:14,592 --> 01:24:15,971
I'm on a mission.

1346
01:24:16,645 --> 01:24:18,136
- W-wait, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1347
01:24:18,517 --> 01:24:19,169
- Hey!
- What do you want?

1348
01:24:19,204 --> 01:24:20,314
Look,
we just want to talk!

1349
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:22,208
I've no time to talk,
I'm on a mission!

1350
01:24:22,243 --> 01:24:24,063
I'm a mercenary goon-bringer.

1351
01:24:24,099 --> 01:24:26,145
- What planet am I on?
- Earth.

1352
01:24:26,187 --> 01:24:28,198
Earth?
Terrible name for a planet,

1353
01:24:28,233 --> 01:24:30,193
might as well
call it "dirt".

1354
01:24:30,194 --> 01:24:32,140
Planet dirt.

1355
01:24:32,181 --> 01:24:35,119
Tell me, is that robot civil war
still going on?

1356
01:24:35,683 --> 01:24:37,234
- Who's winning?
- The Decepticons.

1357
01:24:38,289 --> 01:24:40,461
Well, I changed sides
to the Autobots.

1358
01:24:40,496 --> 01:24:41,909
What do you mean,
"changed sides"?

1359
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:42,887
It's a choice.

1360
01:24:42,922 --> 01:24:47,278
It's intensely personal decision.
So much negativity.

1361
01:24:47,337 --> 01:24:49,389
Who wants to live a life
filled with hate?

1362
01:24:49,424 --> 01:24:50,498
Meaning you don't have
to work for those

1363
01:24:50,529 --> 01:24:52,027
miserable,
freaking Decepticons?

1364
01:24:52,068 --> 01:24:55,436
If they set on their way,
they destroy the whole Universe.

1365
01:24:55,906 --> 01:24:58,225
I'm changing sides,
I'm changing sides, Warrior Goddess!

1366
01:24:58,587 --> 01:25:00,891
- Who's your little Autobot?
- Oh you cutes.

1367
01:25:00,924 --> 01:25:01,691
Name's Wheelie.

1368
01:25:02,313 --> 01:25:03,840
Say my name,
say my name!

1369
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:06,128
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?

1370
01:25:06,163 --> 01:25:07,389
At least he's faithful, Sam.

1371
01:25:07,429 --> 01:25:10,043
Yeah, well, he's faithful,
and he's nude and he's perverted.

1372
01:25:11,852 --> 01:25:13,075
Can you just--
Can you stop?

1373
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:15,385
- Hey, what are you doing?
- ...I don't wanna argue it.

1374
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:16,094
What were you saying?

1375
01:25:16,626 --> 01:25:18,833
I told you
my name was Jetfire!

1376
01:25:20,622 --> 01:25:22,590
Wow, someone shit in the bed
this morning?

1377
01:25:24,822 --> 01:25:26,369
Pretty stout
with my mother.

1378
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:29,014
My ancestors have been here
for centuries.

1379
01:25:29,049 --> 01:25:31,864
My father, one was a wheel!
The first wheel!

1380
01:25:31,899 --> 01:25:33,914
- Do you know what he transformed into?
- No.

1381
01:25:34,168 --> 01:25:39,117
Nothing!
But he did so with honor, dignity and--

1382
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,587
My boosters are fried.

1383
01:25:51,165 --> 01:25:52,674
I thought
we could help each other.

1384
01:25:52,675 --> 01:25:55,167
You know things I don't know.
I know things you don't know.

1385
01:25:55,168 --> 01:25:56,678
- I do.
- I don't think he knows anything.

1386
01:25:56,713 --> 01:25:57,841
Honestly, I don't know.

1387
01:26:01,494 --> 01:26:02,424
These vivid symbols,

1388
01:26:02,466 --> 01:26:04,136
they're symbols
but they are in my mind.

1389
01:26:04,175 --> 01:26:05,466
You see,
all this is in my mind.

1390
01:26:05,501 --> 01:26:07,472
And Megatron
wants what's in my mind.

1391
01:26:07,473 --> 01:26:08,765
Him and someone called
the Fallen.

1392
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,330
The Fallen? I know him.
He left me here to rust.

1393
01:26:12,365 --> 01:26:13,749
The original Decepticon.

1394
01:26:13,777 --> 01:26:17,214
He's terrible to work for.
He's always apocalypse, chaos...

1395
01:26:18,033 --> 01:26:20,112
His suspects,
they were a part of my mission

1396
01:26:20,142 --> 01:26:21,885
the Fall and Search,
I remember now.

1397
01:26:21,925 --> 01:26:24,491
Of a dagger's tip
and the key!

1398
01:26:24,776 --> 01:26:26,452
Slow down.
The dagger's tip, the key,

1399
01:26:26,487 --> 01:26:28,059
- what are you talking about?
- No time to explain.

1400
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:29,628
Hold on, everybody!

1401
01:26:57,336 --> 01:26:58,985
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1402
01:26:59,115 --> 01:27:00,860
I was overseeing
the wrong planet.

1403
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:02,825
Hey, that frickin' hurt!

1404
01:27:04,474 --> 01:27:05,337
Oh, my God!

1405
01:27:12,475 --> 01:27:14,525
Oh, God!

1406
01:27:18,657 --> 01:27:22,020
Oh, my God! You beautiful face,
this will be a perfect moment.

1407
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:24,076
Except you landed
on my testicles.

1408
01:27:24,488 --> 01:27:25,916
Please get off!

1409
01:27:28,813 --> 01:27:29,773
My balls!

1410
01:27:30,733 --> 01:27:32,321
Sam!

1411
01:27:33,251 --> 01:27:36,528
- Where are we? Simmons!
- Hey! Yeah!

1412
01:27:36,529 --> 01:27:37,666
Oh, my God.

1413
01:27:39,183 --> 01:27:41,508
What is this?
It's Vegas!

1414
01:27:41,543 --> 01:27:43,200
- You guys okay?
- Yeah!

1415
01:27:43,201 --> 01:27:46,106
Hey! I think
we're in Vegas!

1416
01:27:46,107 --> 01:27:47,605
That really, really hurts.

1417
01:27:47,646 --> 01:27:49,769
You're just lucky
that I didn't get hurt.

1418
01:27:49,804 --> 01:27:52,459
People could've gotten killed, okay?
And if I would have gotten hurt,

1419
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:54,602
- you would have heard from--
- Oh, shut up!

1420
01:27:54,642 --> 01:27:56,416
I told you
I was opening the space bridge.

1421
01:27:56,447 --> 01:27:58,706
It's the fastest way
to travel to Egypt.

1422
01:27:58,707 --> 01:28:01,204
What did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything!

1423
01:28:01,632 --> 01:28:03,765
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

1424
01:28:03,766 --> 01:28:06,458
Don't you dare
slip in with me, fleshwing.

1425
01:28:06,984 --> 01:28:09,371
- You would do the informed.
- Can you just stop for a second?

1426
01:28:09,401 --> 01:28:11,331
Can you focus?
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1427
01:28:11,366 --> 01:28:14,035
so we can all have a little bit
assemblance and peace of mind?

1428
01:28:14,036 --> 01:28:17,309
This planet was visited
by our race once before

1429
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:20,219
by our earliest ancestors
a millenium ago.

1430
01:28:20,254 --> 01:28:23,255
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

1431
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:25,877
the life blood
of our race.

1432
01:28:25,912 --> 01:28:28,849
Without it, we'll all perish,
oxidize and rust,

1433
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:30,822
let my wretched self.

1434
01:28:30,867 --> 01:28:35,051
Do you have any idea what is
like a slowly fall of parton die?

1435
01:28:35,086 --> 01:28:37,925
Let's not get episodic, okay?
Old-timer.

1436
01:28:38,378 --> 01:28:43,819
Beginning, middle, end.
Facts, details, condense, plot, tell it.

1437
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:48,800
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1438
01:28:48,971 --> 01:28:53,072
It harvests Energon
by destroying suns.

1439
01:28:53,182 --> 01:28:54,914
- Destroy suns?
- You mean blow them up?

1440
01:28:54,933 --> 01:28:58,584
Yes. You see, in the beginning,
there were seven Primes,

1441
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,276
our original leaders.

1442
01:29:00,327 --> 01:29:04,292
And they set out in the Universe
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1443
01:29:04,881 --> 01:29:07,186
The Primes set out
with one rule:

1444
01:29:07,187 --> 01:29:10,334
Never destroy a planet
with life.

1445
01:29:10,335 --> 01:29:13,431
Until one of them
tried to defy this rule.

1446
01:29:13,466 --> 01:29:17,679
And his name, for ever more,
was the Fallen.

1447
01:29:19,389 --> 01:29:21,729
He despised
the human race.

1448
01:29:22,856 --> 01:29:26,937
And he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.

1449
01:29:26,972 --> 01:29:31,371
The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key

1450
01:29:31,372 --> 01:29:34,501
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1451
01:29:40,765 --> 01:29:45,253
A great battle took place
over possession of the Matrix.

1452
01:29:49,638 --> 01:29:52,226
The Fallen who was
stronger at his will did,

1453
01:29:53,587 --> 01:29:58,373
surrendered no choice,
but to steal and hide it from him.

1454
01:29:58,858 --> 01:30:03,681
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away

1455
01:30:03,716 --> 01:30:07,010
in a tomb made of
their very own bodies.

1456
01:30:07,632 --> 01:30:10,624
A tomb
we cannot find.

1457
01:30:11,933 --> 01:30:14,839
Somewhere,
buried in this desert,

1458
01:30:14,874 --> 01:30:17,476
that deadly machine
remains.

1459
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:19,707
The Fallen knows
where it is.

1460
01:30:19,742 --> 01:30:25,584
And if he finds the Tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1461
01:30:25,866 --> 01:30:27,362
Okay so how do we stop it?

1462
01:30:27,398 --> 01:30:29,545
Only a Prime
can defeat the Fallen.

1463
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:31,149
Optimus Prime?

1464
01:30:33,988 --> 01:30:36,075
So you met a Prime?

1465
01:30:36,693 --> 01:30:39,235
You must have met
a great descendant.

1466
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:40,188
Is he alive?

1467
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:42,749
Here?
On this planet?

1468
01:30:43,043 --> 01:30:45,310
He sacrificed himself
to save me.

1469
01:30:46,048 --> 01:30:47,297
So he's dead.

1470
01:30:47,469 --> 01:30:49,336
Without a Prime,
it's impossible.

1471
01:30:49,637 --> 01:30:51,747
No one else
could stop the Fallen.

1472
01:30:51,781 --> 01:30:54,943
So the same energy that's going
to be used to reactivate the machine...

1473
01:30:55,673 --> 01:30:58,644
Could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1474
01:30:58,679 --> 01:30:59,647
and bring him
back to life?

1475
01:30:59,682 --> 01:31:01,690
It was never designed
for that purpose,

1476
01:31:01,726 --> 01:31:04,429
but it's an energy,
like no other.

1477
01:31:04,621 --> 01:31:08,560
So then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1478
01:31:08,595 --> 01:31:11,871
Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols,

1479
01:31:11,907 --> 01:31:14,517
what you got in the sand,
it's your bloom.

1480
01:31:14,517 --> 01:31:16,775
When dawn alights
the Dagger's tip,

1481
01:31:16,815 --> 01:31:19,607
three kings will reveal
the doorway.

1482
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:21,760
Find the doorway!

1483
01:31:21,794 --> 01:31:23,294
Go now, go!

1484
01:31:23,548 --> 01:31:26,518
That was my mission.
It's your mission now.

1485
01:31:26,553 --> 01:31:29,062
Go before
the Decepticons find me

1486
01:31:29,183 --> 01:31:31,068
and find you.

1487
01:31:37,391 --> 01:31:38,868
That was
my CIA contact.

1488
01:31:38,908 --> 01:31:41,228
Says Ancient Sumerian used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba

1489
01:31:41,278 --> 01:31:43,480
- the Dagger's Tip.
- That's the dagger's tip.

1490
01:31:43,515 --> 01:31:44,661
- It's part of the Red Sea.
- Got it.

1491
01:31:44,696 --> 01:31:46,902
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1492
01:31:46,937 --> 01:31:49,592
29 and a half degrees north.
35 east.

1493
01:31:50,028 --> 01:31:50,813
There it is.

1494
01:31:51,038 --> 01:31:53,225
Okay, first thing we gotta do
is get Optimus to Dagger's Tip.

1495
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:54,857
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

1496
01:31:55,669 --> 01:31:56,560
We're gonna make a call.

1497
01:31:59,905 --> 01:32:00,805
We got the cops.

1498
01:32:07,323 --> 01:32:08,941
I can't go to prison, guys!

1499
01:32:12,406 --> 01:32:15,055
Sam, you gotta get off
this road and lay low.

1500
01:32:25,647 --> 01:32:27,574
Man, they'll pick up.

1501
01:32:27,609 --> 01:32:29,829
This is just called
blending in like a ninja.

1502
01:32:29,864 --> 01:32:31,718
How about I'll lay my piss
in your face?

1503
01:32:32,721 --> 01:32:33,487
They're gone.

1504
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:35,176
Wait another time.

1505
01:32:35,373 --> 01:32:36,512
How are you gonna make
the call to Lennox?

1506
01:32:36,547 --> 01:32:39,004
You are in the worldwide. What,
they're gonna tranquil in one base?

1507
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:40,487
They'll track you here
in seconds.

1508
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:42,442
CIA is all over this place.

1509
01:32:42,454 --> 01:32:43,417
You're gonna call?

1510
01:32:48,704 --> 01:32:50,677
Okay,
that's--that's a good idea.

1511
01:32:50,678 --> 01:32:52,326
- Alright?
- I mean I just was...

1512
01:32:52,796 --> 01:32:53,896
My mind in other things.

1513
01:32:53,931 --> 01:32:55,540
Like why don't you get
being chipped in prison.

1514
01:32:56,191 --> 01:32:58,073
New Jersey

1515
01:32:58,109 --> 01:33:00,428
<i>This departure:
2100 hours.</i>

1516
01:33:01,963 --> 01:33:03,348
So we're shipped in
back to base.

1517
01:33:04,142 --> 01:33:05,568
This is central at stake.

1518
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,191
Major Lennox, phone call.

1519
01:33:13,915 --> 01:33:15,824
Lennox, I'm with the kid.
The kid, you know?

1520
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:17,130
One with the attitude break?

1521
01:33:17,131 --> 01:33:18,670
I need the truck.
The truck.

1522
01:33:18,705 --> 01:33:21,426
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

1523
01:33:21,461 --> 01:33:22,579
You're not gonna believe
where we are.

1524
01:33:22,588 --> 01:33:25,718
Code Tot,
as in King Tutankhamen,

1525
01:33:25,748 --> 01:33:27,418
back of a $1 bill.

1526
01:33:27,836 --> 01:33:32,671
Coordinates for air-drop,
29.5 north, 34.88 east.

1527
01:33:32,705 --> 01:33:33,969
Get it.
Write it down, write it.

1528
01:33:34,373 --> 01:33:35,340
Oh, my God.

1529
01:33:35,376 --> 01:33:36,861
I gotta go, okay.
I hate the cops.

1530
01:33:36,862 --> 01:33:38,073
W-Wait, who are you?

1531
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:42,196
Wait, it's me.
Leo, me, Leo, Leo. Leo.

1532
01:33:42,299 --> 01:33:43,612
The cops are coming right now.
We need to go.

1533
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:50,216
Coordinates
29.5 north, 34.88 east.

1534
01:33:50,217 --> 01:33:52,638
Tip of the Red Sea,
Gulf of Aqaba.

1535
01:33:53,122 --> 01:33:53,987
Egypt.

1536
01:33:54,656 --> 01:33:55,750
Are you serious?

1537
01:33:57,198 --> 01:33:57,777
Sir.

1538
01:34:02,561 --> 01:34:05,348
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there.

1539
01:34:05,349 --> 01:34:07,976
How is this little kid's
supposed to bring him back to life?

1540
01:34:08,891 --> 01:34:09,726
I don't know.

1541
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:11,708
But we gotta trust him.

1542
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:15,146
Okay, let's go
over it again.

1543
01:34:15,147 --> 01:34:17,599
- When the dawn arise...
- When the dawn arise the dagger's tip,

1544
01:34:17,638 --> 01:34:19,714
- the three kings...
- ...will reveal the doorway.

1545
01:34:19,749 --> 01:34:21,491
That's what he said.
You know what that means?

1546
01:34:21,682 --> 01:34:23,400
- No, what does it mean?
- I have no idea.

1547
01:34:23,401 --> 01:34:25,272
Oh my God, oh my God.
Checkpoint, checkpoint.

1548
01:34:25,307 --> 01:34:26,349
I don't have
my passport.

1549
01:34:28,831 --> 01:34:33,142
Passport.
Idiota (Idiot)!

1550
01:34:37,554 --> 01:34:38,799
They have cams at top.

1551
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:42,711
He's the one
that they want.

1552
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:45,537
Alright, chill.
Let's be nice to them.

1553
01:34:46,152 --> 01:34:47,820
I can handle it.
These are my people.

1554
01:34:47,981 --> 01:34:49,881
- Yeah.
- I'm 136.

1555
01:34:52,377 --> 01:34:54,004
Oh great, a frickin' munchkin.

1556
01:34:54,039 --> 01:34:56,422
Oh, little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.

1557
01:35:01,651 --> 01:35:05,472
- What do you want?
- I want to go to...

1558
01:35:05,548 --> 01:35:08,366
The Dagger's Tip, right?

1559
01:35:08,367 --> 01:35:11,008
Egypt, Jordan.
We wanna go there.

1560
01:35:11,009 --> 01:35:13,019
Me and my family.
This is my family.

1561
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:15,064
- This is my son, my other son.
- Hi there.

1562
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:15,832
My daughter.

1563
01:35:15,953 --> 01:35:18,105
We're tourists
from New York.

1564
01:35:18,226 --> 01:35:19,832
- New York?
- Yes. Yes.

1565
01:35:20,192 --> 01:35:21,299
50 kilometres.

1566
01:35:21,334 --> 01:35:22,731
We're going to get one
of your falafels, thank you!

1567
01:35:22,766 --> 01:35:23,720
Yeah,
thank you very much.

1568
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,785
- New York.
- I know, I know you from somewhere.

1569
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:27,801
No, we do not work
for the CIA.

1570
01:35:32,259 --> 01:35:35,770
<i>Decepticons,
voice location.</i>

1571
01:35:35,964 --> 01:35:36,956
<i>Detected.</i>

1572
01:35:38,279 --> 01:35:41,426
Starscream in pursuit.

1573
01:35:45,781 --> 01:35:48,765
Undercover, yo, you gotta blend in
with your surrounding.

1574
01:35:48,795 --> 01:35:51,036
You know, you gotta be
part of the landscape.

1575
01:35:59,321 --> 01:36:00,035
Awesome.

1576
01:36:01,104 --> 01:36:02,319
I think
aliens built that.

1577
01:36:02,937 --> 01:36:04,174
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1578
01:36:04,379 --> 01:36:05,857
Go, move it!
Move it.

1579
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:07,343
- What?
- Hey, guard us.

1580
01:36:07,573 --> 01:36:08,908
Low-profile,
don't make a scene, okay?

1581
01:36:08,943 --> 01:36:10,346
Yeah, some of us
got work to do!

1582
01:36:10,677 --> 01:36:11,949
Dumb Autobots.

1583
01:36:15,371 --> 01:36:18,566
Estimated time of detachment
NEST, 0600 AM

1584
01:36:33,345 --> 01:36:35,390
Being my girlfriend
is hazardous to your health.

1585
01:36:37,136 --> 01:36:41,527
Yeah, well,
girls like dangerous boys.

1586
01:36:42,004 --> 01:36:43,352
- Really?
- Yeah.

1587
01:36:46,216 --> 01:36:47,845
Why don't you say it?

1588
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:49,673
Ladies first.

1589
01:36:51,381 --> 01:36:53,691
Okay, so tonight,
you're gonna be a gentleman.

1590
01:36:54,209 --> 01:36:55,571
You're really chivalrous.

1591
01:36:55,942 --> 01:36:56,898
Why are you mad at me?

1592
01:36:57,484 --> 01:36:59,521
You know what?
Baby, I'm not...

1593
01:36:59,922 --> 01:37:01,409
I'm not mad.

1594
01:37:02,061 --> 01:37:06,476
You realise that I just flew 3,000 miles
to keep you from getting killed.

1595
01:37:06,634 --> 01:37:07,453
I know.

1596
01:37:11,086 --> 01:37:12,947
Who else could be
your girlfriend too?

1597
01:37:13,891 --> 01:37:15,942
Look at the things
that go through with me.

1598
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,616
And now we're underneath
the moon and the stars

1599
01:37:19,651 --> 01:37:21,947
and the three most beautiful
pyramids on the planet

1600
01:37:21,988 --> 01:37:24,042
and you still can't even tell me
that you love me.

1601
01:37:27,722 --> 01:37:28,695
- What?
- Wait.

1602
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:31,339
- Why do boys always change the subject?
- The moon and the stars...

1603
01:37:31,374 --> 01:37:33,136
- Sam...
- Come with me really quick.

1604
01:37:40,994 --> 01:37:43,066
Simmons, Leo,
wake up!

1605
01:37:46,381 --> 01:37:48,626
Listen, Astronomy class, page 47,
you remember the class?

1606
01:37:48,661 --> 01:37:51,256
No, no, I was only in college
for two days, you remember that?

1607
01:37:51,291 --> 01:37:53,267
- Yeah, well, get up. Up, up.
- What are you talking about?

1608
01:37:58,943 --> 01:38:00,011
Can you see
those three stars?

1609
01:38:00,046 --> 01:38:01,757
You see how the last one
touches the horizon?

1610
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:03,129
That's Orion's belt.

1611
01:38:03,449 --> 01:38:05,731
It's also called the Three Kings
and the reason for that is

1612
01:38:05,766 --> 01:38:08,498
the three Egyptian kings who built
the pyramids in Giza built them

1613
01:38:08,533 --> 01:38:09,675
to mear those stars.

1614
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:11,501
So it's like an aerial staring
straight in the face.

1615
01:38:11,534 --> 01:38:13,320
They all point due east
towards Jordan.

1616
01:38:13,653 --> 01:38:14,953
The mountains of Petra.

1617
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:32,155
<i>We got a seatbelt malfunction.
We gotta have to divert...</i>

1618
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:33,784
<i>Flight in lower,
prepare for bail-out.</i>

1619
01:38:33,928 --> 01:38:36,144
Bail-out, bail-out,
bail-out, bail-out?

1620
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:38,327
Alright, team,
grab your shoots.

1621
01:38:38,363 --> 01:38:39,127
Bail-out?

1622
01:38:41,681 --> 01:38:43,319
Familiar with the standard
MC-4?

1623
01:38:43,554 --> 01:38:46,366
Of course not. I've never jumped out
of a publicly good airplane before.

1624
01:38:46,598 --> 01:38:47,970
Wait a minute,
is this really happening?

1625
01:38:47,971 --> 01:38:48,387
Yeah.

1626
01:38:51,015 --> 01:38:52,478
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1627
01:38:52,958 --> 01:38:54,362
You're behind this,
aren't you?

1628
01:38:54,565 --> 01:38:55,532
What are you talking about?

1629
01:38:55,567 --> 01:38:57,662
You heard the pilot.
These guys don't mess around.

1630
01:38:58,855 --> 01:39:01,863
This is standard procedure.
I'm just following orders to the letter.

1631
01:39:01,898 --> 01:39:03,106
Do you know
what you said?

1632
01:39:04,147 --> 01:39:06,537
You, just find the captain
and your career--

1633
01:39:12,115 --> 01:39:13,303
Wait, what was that?
What's that?

1634
01:39:13,486 --> 01:39:14,533
That's not good.

1635
01:39:15,048 --> 01:39:17,322
Come on.
Right this way, right this way!

1636
01:39:17,362 --> 01:39:18,085
I can't jump
out of an airplane.

1637
01:39:23,481 --> 01:39:25,752
Come here.
Come here.

1638
01:39:26,956 --> 01:39:29,755
Because I have to secure
the VIPs first.

1639
01:39:29,756 --> 01:39:32,102
Okay, I want you
to listen very carefully.

1640
01:39:32,103 --> 01:39:33,930
Remember as everything
that I say.

1641
01:39:34,172 --> 01:39:37,418
East to the GPS trackers, so
you can be found by search and rescue.

1642
01:39:41,636 --> 01:39:43,023
- Look, are you listening?
- I can't.

1643
01:39:44,316 --> 01:39:45,970
- Alright, alright.
- Alright.

1644
01:39:46,054 --> 01:39:48,006
When the plane that shoot
inflates into the air,

1645
01:39:48,026 --> 01:39:50,054
pull the pin
and open some air,

1646
01:39:50,064 --> 01:39:52,270
break your rack up,
lose your primary.

1647
01:39:52,464 --> 01:39:53,775
I want you
to pull the blue.

1648
01:39:53,896 --> 01:39:55,639
I need you to pull it
really hard.

1649
01:39:56,434 --> 01:39:59,007
Not right now.
We're on the plane, you dumbass!

1650
01:40:02,324 --> 01:40:03,380
Did he say goodbye?

1651
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:05,149
No, he didn't even
say goodbye.

1652
01:40:05,673 --> 01:40:07,321
<i>General,
we're loaded and ready.</i>

1653
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:10,398
<i>You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in five minutes.</i>

1654
01:40:10,615 --> 01:40:11,682
- Excellent.
- Sir,

1655
01:40:11,685 --> 01:40:13,453
you need to see this.
Now.

1656
01:40:16,051 --> 01:40:17,711
Have we checked
these coordinates?

1657
01:40:17,746 --> 01:40:19,155
Egypt, sir.
They're air-dropping in.

1658
01:40:19,176 --> 01:40:20,481
You gotta be kidding me.

1659
01:40:21,037 --> 01:40:22,263
He knows something.

1660
01:40:22,382 --> 01:40:25,246
We need to be ready to back him up,
if this thing goes hot.

1661
01:40:26,114 --> 01:40:26,864
Copy that.

1662
01:40:27,390 --> 01:40:29,549
CIA just got a hit
on the boy.

1663
01:40:30,601 --> 01:40:32,669
Hundred miles from the location
on that little map there.

1664
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:33,475
It's getting hotter.

1665
01:40:38,157 --> 01:40:40,584
It's gotta be...
around here somewhere.

1666
01:41:21,245 --> 01:41:22,498
It's here somewhere,
guys.

1667
01:41:22,538 --> 01:41:23,494
Oh yeah, why?

1668
01:41:23,792 --> 01:41:25,545
'Cause we're trusting
Grandpa Blackbird

1669
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:26,931
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on.

1670
01:41:27,001 --> 01:41:29,469
On his defense,
this is the biggest doorway

1671
01:41:29,504 --> 01:41:31,188
I've ever seen
in my entire life.

1672
01:41:31,893 --> 01:41:34,608
Okay. Well, that's great.
Let me do a quick search, alright?

1673
01:41:35,298 --> 01:41:35,973
Nope.

1674
01:41:36,123 --> 01:41:38,727
Ever questioned mind, guys, that
archaeologists have been here before.

1675
01:41:38,762 --> 01:41:39,670
There's nothing here.

1676
01:41:39,721 --> 01:41:42,051
You realise it's heart-break,
despair, kid.

1677
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:44,426
Sometimes, you get
to the end of the rainbow

1678
01:41:44,466 --> 01:41:46,630
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it.

1679
01:41:46,661 --> 01:41:48,335
I'm listening to you;
you live with your mother.

1680
01:41:50,072 --> 01:41:52,445
- It's not over.
- It is over. It's done.

1681
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:54,092
Why are we still listening
to your little punk-ass?

1682
01:41:54,127 --> 01:41:56,226
I mean, what kind of dumbfucks
accept ding my rim?

1683
01:41:56,261 --> 01:41:58,265
Kill Megatron.
How about that?

1684
01:41:58,300 --> 01:41:59,909
Well, he doesn't get the job done,
you know, I mean,

1685
01:41:59,939 --> 01:42:01,832
- 'cause he's zapped, man.
- You scared?

1686
01:42:01,853 --> 01:42:03,717
Well, scared?
Scared of your ugly face.

1687
01:42:04,015 --> 01:42:06,599
I'm ugly?
Well, we twins, you stupid genius.

1688
01:42:13,599 --> 01:42:15,439
Guys!
Oh, hey!

1689
01:42:16,043 --> 01:42:17,183
You like
the way that feels?

1690
01:42:17,217 --> 01:42:18,824
- That ain't hurt.
- You got that, don't you?

1691
01:42:18,859 --> 01:42:19,648
I'm getting up--

1692
01:42:28,661 --> 01:42:29,838
Now that's rude.

1693
01:42:41,196 --> 01:42:43,505
Oh, my God!
The symbols.

1694
01:42:44,619 --> 01:42:46,246
Bee!
Shoot it.

1695
01:43:16,816 --> 01:43:17,328
Wow!

1696
01:43:17,363 --> 01:43:19,092
This is the part
which they found silicon.

1697
01:43:20,370 --> 01:43:21,945
The Tomb of the Primes.

1698
01:43:40,462 --> 01:43:41,437
The Matrix.

1699
01:44:05,386 --> 01:44:07,899
Thousands of years
turned to dust.

1700
01:44:08,571 --> 01:44:10,226
This isn't how
it's supposed to end.

1701
01:44:10,896 --> 01:44:11,811
Hear that?

1702
01:44:16,286 --> 01:44:19,035
US Air Force. C-17s.

1703
01:44:20,326 --> 01:44:22,852
You can't bring it back, Sam,
there's nothing left.

1704
01:44:23,106 --> 01:44:25,077
Look, look around you.

1705
01:44:25,335 --> 01:44:28,004
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all.

1706
01:44:28,039 --> 01:44:29,441
They just haven't
end like this.

1707
01:44:29,457 --> 01:44:31,303
There is a reason
that we're here.

1708
01:44:31,338 --> 01:44:33,727
The voices and the symbols
in my head led us here...

1709
01:44:33,728 --> 01:44:34,951
for a purpose.

1710
01:44:40,863 --> 01:44:42,936
Everyone's after me
because of what I know.

1711
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:48,336
And what I know,
is that this is going to work.

1712
01:44:48,988 --> 01:44:50,647
How do you know
it's going to work?

1713
01:44:50,682 --> 01:44:52,178
Because I believe it.

1714
01:45:02,683 --> 01:45:04,716
Best put me out
of this plane.

1715
01:45:15,142 --> 01:45:18,116
He's dropping the big one.
Sam!

1716
01:45:25,466 --> 01:45:27,791
You think you can bring him
back to life with that pixie dust?

1717
01:45:27,826 --> 01:45:29,570
Absolutely.
Let's go!

1718
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:40,058
Go!

1719
01:45:41,730 --> 01:45:42,362
Move it!

1720
01:45:43,043 --> 01:45:44,367
Remember your friendly!

1721
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:55,969
Cover Optimus!

1722
01:45:59,247 --> 01:46:01,293
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.

1723
01:46:01,294 --> 01:46:03,376
Get snipers and Stingers
up high.

1724
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:06,153
So he just dropped off
ten tonnes of dead robot

1725
01:46:06,173 --> 01:46:07,229
in the middle of nowhere.

1726
01:46:07,804 --> 01:46:09,601
Hope this little kid
know what he's doing.

1727
01:46:09,637 --> 01:46:10,601
Yeah, me too.

1728
01:46:16,567 --> 01:46:19,962
Got a visual!
Yellow tee, four klicks.

1729
01:46:23,103 --> 01:46:24,247
Hot-flare!

1730
01:46:26,815 --> 01:46:28,625
That's them right there.
You see the flare?

1731
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:29,689
Right over there!
See it?

1732
01:46:31,026 --> 01:46:33,088
The boy has been found.

1733
01:46:40,547 --> 01:46:41,364
Sam!

1734
01:46:53,899 --> 01:46:55,397
Oh God, please God,

1735
01:46:55,425 --> 01:46:56,578
- please!
- Leo, stop freaking out.

1736
01:46:56,613 --> 01:46:58,906
- Just stop freaking out!
- Just drop this guy off, huh?

1737
01:46:58,941 --> 01:47:00,563
- Please let me live, just let me live.
- Stop freaking out!

1738
01:47:00,883 --> 01:47:02,427
Just stop screaming
right now. That's it.

1739
01:47:05,055 --> 01:47:06,983
Can't take that guy
anymore.

1740
01:47:29,501 --> 01:47:30,135
We gotta split up.

1741
01:47:30,175 --> 01:47:33,072
Bumblebee, you are the decoy.
You lead the Decepticons away, alright?

1742
01:47:33,396 --> 01:47:34,430
I'm gonna get Optimus.

1743
01:47:34,431 --> 01:47:36,456
I'll help throw their fire away.

1744
01:47:36,836 --> 01:47:38,347
You get to those soldiers.

1745
01:47:40,087 --> 01:47:41,559
I hope
that dust works, kid.

1746
01:47:41,989 --> 01:47:42,930
Thank you.

1747
01:47:46,944 --> 01:47:47,911
It's turning around.

1748
01:47:48,895 --> 01:47:50,238
It's coming back,
it's coming back.

1749
01:47:51,408 --> 01:47:52,169
It's up to me.

1750
01:47:52,411 --> 01:47:55,346
One man, alone, betrayed
by the country he loves,

1751
01:47:55,381 --> 01:47:57,844
now its last hope
in the final hour of need.

1752
01:47:57,845 --> 01:48:00,405
The pants are to be driven
like never before.

1753
01:48:00,406 --> 01:48:01,600
Under my skin.

1754
01:48:01,705 --> 01:48:03,538
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't go nowhere.

1755
01:48:03,574 --> 01:48:05,626
- Drive!
- You will never make it, kid.

1756
01:48:05,661 --> 01:48:07,304
Bravery will only get you
so far.

1757
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:09,946
You tased me, okay?
You owe me.

1758
01:48:09,981 --> 01:48:10,995
- I'm go.
- Okay, okay.

1759
01:48:11,192 --> 01:48:12,515
That was a test.
You passed, alright?

1760
01:48:20,216 --> 01:48:22,429
Thing's got alien tattoos
all over.

1761
01:48:22,827 --> 01:48:24,063
That ain't Air Force.

1762
01:48:27,797 --> 01:48:29,179
What the hell was that?

1763
01:48:29,214 --> 01:48:30,955
- Eddy-1, copy.
- Anyone there?

1764
01:48:30,990 --> 01:48:31,659
Who's up?

1765
01:48:31,700 --> 01:48:33,124
- Copy.
- Radio's down.

1766
01:48:33,159 --> 01:48:34,594
It's dead.
Counter that.

1767
01:48:34,624 --> 01:48:35,669
EMP-burst.

1768
01:48:36,386 --> 01:48:39,294
Let's see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

1769
01:48:41,284 --> 01:48:42,074
Yes, sir.

1770
01:48:42,114 --> 01:48:44,293
<i>Major Lennox told me
to pull the cord.</i>

1771
01:48:44,293 --> 01:48:44,862
I know, sir.

1772
01:48:45,015 --> 01:48:47,559
W-Which, what country
am I in right now?

1773
01:48:47,560 --> 01:48:48,916
United States.

1774
01:48:49,407 --> 01:48:53,097
No, no, not the United States.
I'm from the United States,

1775
01:48:53,137 --> 01:48:55,348
<i>I'm in the middle of nowhere,
surrounded by goats.</i>

1776
01:48:56,022 --> 01:48:58,683
Well, that was
our good friend, Galloway.

1777
01:48:58,684 --> 01:49:00,555
He's less than pleased.

1778
01:49:00,887 --> 01:49:03,525
How is it that
we can't reach our men,

1779
01:49:03,565 --> 01:49:09,309
but he can reach me
from some random Egyptian desert?

1780
01:49:13,089 --> 01:49:13,711
Nothing.

1781
01:49:14,568 --> 01:49:17,627
Mike, put an SOS, let the eye in the sky
know we need some help.

1782
01:49:17,662 --> 01:49:18,326
Yes, sir.

1783
01:49:20,247 --> 01:49:22,681
Pop some more flares
so that the kid can find us.

1784
01:49:29,785 --> 01:49:31,952
There he is.
We got a couple of miles.

1785
01:49:32,372 --> 01:49:37,219
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

1786
01:49:37,254 --> 01:49:42,869
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

1787
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:45,243
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

1788
01:49:45,594 --> 01:49:46,987
Our satellites in the area
have gone blind.

1789
01:49:47,022 --> 01:49:48,006
We're working it, sir.

1790
01:49:48,146 --> 01:49:49,171
Dammit.

1791
01:49:49,348 --> 01:49:51,901
Something's not right,
it doesn't add up.

1792
01:49:51,936 --> 01:49:55,238
Contact the Jordanians, see what
their assets they've got in the area.

1793
01:49:55,239 --> 01:49:57,628
And get Egypt's
General Salaam,

1794
01:49:57,668 --> 01:50:01,769
ask him to clear some US
V over-flights in Egyptian airspace.

1795
01:50:01,804 --> 01:50:04,801
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

1796
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:06,461
Scramble predators now.

1797
01:50:06,804 --> 01:50:08,253
B-1, rotate.

1798
01:50:20,174 --> 01:50:21,341
East on the mile
that way.

1799
01:50:27,743 --> 01:50:28,332
Come here.

1800
01:50:31,919 --> 01:50:32,722
This way.

1801
01:50:38,287 --> 01:50:41,725
- One man... alone...
- Stop saying that.

1802
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,675
- betrayed by the country he loves.
- Oh my goodness,

1803
01:50:43,704 --> 01:50:45,594
I'm in the car, okay?
You're not alone.

1804
01:50:46,036 --> 01:50:47,827
Just relax,
you're looking nice well.

1805
01:50:57,013 --> 01:50:58,638
I-I don't think
he's still following us.

1806
01:51:00,107 --> 01:51:01,278
That's what you think.

1807
01:51:18,798 --> 01:51:22,450
Master, sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

1808
01:51:22,485 --> 01:51:25,470
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

1809
01:51:25,761 --> 01:51:28,040
The boy must have
the Matrix.

1810
01:51:28,423 --> 01:51:31,026
We cannot let him
reach Optimus.

1811
01:51:31,551 --> 01:51:33,383
Decepticons!

1812
01:51:33,546 --> 01:51:35,327
Begin our assault!

1813
01:51:36,213 --> 01:51:37,570
We got incoming!

1814
01:51:53,853 --> 01:51:56,017
We got a whole load of
flight coming our way!

1815
01:51:56,770 --> 01:51:58,650
- How many?
- We got 13 to count.

1816
01:51:59,107 --> 01:52:01,716
This ain't good.
This ain't good.

1817
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:12,026
We 'bout to get
our asses whooped.

1818
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:17,558
Alright, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.

1819
01:52:19,255 --> 01:52:22,100
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life.

1820
01:52:22,135 --> 01:52:25,254
So our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.

1821
01:52:25,317 --> 01:52:27,154
Alright, we're gonna draw
fire from the left flag.

1822
01:52:27,216 --> 01:52:28,202
I need a scout team.

1823
01:52:29,073 --> 01:52:31,113
We'll walk through the middle
with Arcee and Ironhide.

1824
01:52:31,696 --> 01:52:33,222
Alright, when you see
the precious cargo,

1825
01:52:33,272 --> 01:52:36,200
I want you to pop green smoke
and come back to those pillars.

1826
01:52:36,241 --> 01:52:37,461
We'll have
the ambush set.

1827
01:52:37,799 --> 01:52:39,199
Alright, let's go,
move out!

1828
01:52:39,200 --> 01:52:39,836
- Move out!
- Move out!

1829
01:52:48,592 --> 01:52:50,764
Did you see that film
Gunfight Aero-Kay Karao?

1830
01:52:52,803 --> 01:52:55,917
- Casting Kirk Douglas.
- No, why?

1831
01:52:58,997 --> 01:53:00,404
Looks like we're right
in the middle of it.

1832
01:53:00,843 --> 01:53:01,661
Is that good?

1833
01:53:04,122 --> 01:53:05,488
Lot of people died.

1834
01:53:21,993 --> 01:53:24,653
- Oh, oh, oh...
- Hide!

1835
01:53:26,946 --> 01:53:28,085
Oh my God!

1836
01:53:50,236 --> 01:53:51,349
Sam, Sam.

1837
01:53:55,256 --> 01:53:56,214
Get down, get down.

1838
01:54:00,882 --> 01:54:02,174
Once, it's clear,
we'll run for Optimus

1839
01:54:02,209 --> 01:54:03,579
as fast we can, okay?

1840
01:54:05,413 --> 01:54:06,605
And what if
it doesn't work?

1841
01:54:07,753 --> 01:54:08,668
This will work.

1842
01:54:09,281 --> 01:54:11,109
- Yeah, but what if it doesn't?
- It's gonna work.

1843
01:54:11,733 --> 01:54:12,638
It'll work.

1844
01:56:00,362 --> 01:56:01,427
Radio shell.

1845
01:56:20,795 --> 01:56:21,971
We got a half a mile.

1846
01:56:22,136 --> 01:56:23,618
I don't think
the soldiers know we're here.

1847
01:56:26,411 --> 01:56:27,080
Fall back!

1848
01:56:27,687 --> 01:56:29,243
Ironhide, up for middle.

1849
01:56:29,583 --> 01:56:30,735
Ironhide, move it.

1850
01:56:31,587 --> 01:56:33,537
Go!
Go, go!

1851
01:56:44,866 --> 01:56:46,338
There's no way to go.
We're gonna die!

1852
01:56:46,339 --> 01:56:48,720
Listen, we're going out.
We're going out like men, understand?

1853
01:57:18,384 --> 01:57:20,490
- Oh.
- Look at this motherf--

1854
01:57:21,080 --> 01:57:23,074
Mean robots suck!

1855
01:57:35,675 --> 01:57:36,443
Get back!

1856
01:57:41,473 --> 01:57:42,882
Grab it!
Don't let go.

1857
01:57:43,058 --> 01:57:44,504
Hang in, man,
I got this.

1858
01:57:49,481 --> 01:57:50,658
I don't wanna die.

1859
01:57:52,928 --> 01:57:54,849
Careful grip, boy.
Careful grip.

1860
01:58:00,510 --> 01:58:03,032
He did.
He got so waste.

1861
01:58:03,376 --> 01:58:04,582
Who's your daddy
now, huh?

1862
01:58:04,617 --> 01:58:05,752
He got all these...

1863
01:58:06,215 --> 01:58:08,042
Well, the safe place
is right under it.

1864
01:58:08,329 --> 01:58:10,644
Run it.
Run for his feet!

1865
01:58:19,128 --> 01:58:22,518
You're never eating me.
I'm gonna bust your face up.

1866
01:58:31,133 --> 01:58:33,504
Nobody's tested me.
In your face!

1867
01:58:34,692 --> 01:58:35,839
Take five, Mudflap.

1868
01:58:37,151 --> 01:58:38,089
Oh my God!

1869
01:58:41,437 --> 01:58:43,285
Yeehaw!

1870
01:58:45,005 --> 01:58:46,853
Nobody messes
with the twins.

1871
01:58:49,874 --> 01:58:50,883
I got you.

1872
01:58:54,471 --> 01:58:56,800
Ow, man,
you shot me in the face!

1873
01:58:57,243 --> 01:58:59,501
- Stay under it!
- Yeah, stay under it.

1874
01:59:09,342 --> 01:59:12,013
Rampage, set up the trap.

1875
01:59:20,902 --> 01:59:21,388
Judy!

1876
01:59:27,128 --> 01:59:28,731
- Sam!
- What?

1877
01:59:28,766 --> 01:59:29,541
Sam!

1878
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:31,872
Sam! Sam!

1879
01:59:36,565 --> 01:59:37,589
Sam!

1880
01:59:38,099 --> 01:59:38,996
- Sam.
- Dad!

1881
01:59:47,047 --> 01:59:48,566
Wait! Wait!

1882
01:59:49,888 --> 01:59:50,637
Please listen--

1883
01:59:51,824 --> 01:59:53,444
I want you to run!
Run!

1884
01:59:53,484 --> 01:59:54,450
- Dad, just stop!
- Get out of here.

1885
01:59:54,485 --> 01:59:55,778
- They don't want you, they want me.
- Just run!

1886
01:59:56,023 --> 01:59:57,442
Oh God, wait!

1887
01:59:57,526 --> 02:00:00,290
- Samuel Witwicky.
- Wait.

1888
02:00:02,257 --> 02:00:03,570
This is what you want.
You don't want 'em.

1889
02:00:04,022 --> 02:00:06,027
- Go! Go!
- Please, stop! Stop!

1890
02:00:06,028 --> 02:00:07,979
- Why don't you--
- Just get out of here!

1891
02:00:09,106 --> 02:00:10,003
Just don't move.

1892
02:00:10,562 --> 02:00:11,210
I know you.

1893
02:00:11,432 --> 02:00:13,130
Just go!
Just go!

1894
02:00:13,166 --> 02:00:14,588
And I know what,
you need me.

1895
02:00:15,533 --> 02:00:16,642
Because I know about
the Matrix.

1896
02:00:17,484 --> 02:00:19,089
- Don't do it. Sam, listen to me.
- Please, Dad.

1897
02:00:19,128 --> 02:00:20,084
They're gonna
kill us all anyway.

1898
02:00:20,119 --> 02:00:21,571
Hey, hey.
Look.

1899
02:00:21,572 --> 02:00:22,924
This is what you want.
I'm here.

1900
02:00:23,641 --> 02:00:24,865
Bumblebee!

1901
02:00:28,968 --> 02:00:29,718
Help!

1902
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:39,663
Kill him, Bee.
Kill him.

1903
02:01:18,947 --> 02:01:20,162
Come on,
get in.

1904
02:01:34,344 --> 02:01:36,273
- Bee?
- Yeah.

1905
02:01:39,487 --> 02:01:42,677
Hey! I don't know what's going on,
but we gotta move.

1906
02:01:46,308 --> 02:01:48,036
- Run!
- There's gotta be a way out of here.

1907
02:01:53,410 --> 02:01:55,330
Buckle up, buckle up!
Get in here.

1908
02:01:57,580 --> 02:01:59,730
Bee! Bumblebee!

1909
02:02:00,444 --> 02:02:02,302
You get them
somewhere safe, alright?

1910
02:02:04,758 --> 02:02:06,092
You gotta get in the car.
You can be safe.

1911
02:02:06,132 --> 02:02:07,954
No, listen
to my discussion.

1912
02:02:07,989 --> 02:02:09,379
- You're my son, alright?
- I know!

1913
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:11,303
You're my son!
We'll all go together.

1914
02:02:11,343 --> 02:02:12,780
- Listen.
- We're all going together.

1915
02:02:12,815 --> 02:02:14,903
Dad, stop, okay?
Get in the car.

1916
02:02:14,938 --> 02:02:16,970
He's gonna get you to safety.
You don't, you run.

1917
02:02:17,005 --> 02:02:19,220
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run.
You hear what I'm saying?

1918
02:02:19,464 --> 02:02:21,091
Okay?
I'll find you when you're safe.

1919
02:02:21,126 --> 02:02:22,587
- No.
- You gotta let me go, Dad.

1920
02:02:22,622 --> 02:02:23,982
You'll have
to let me go.

1921
02:02:24,615 --> 02:02:26,115
- You have to.
- Ron.

1922
02:02:28,625 --> 02:02:31,219
Ron, Ron!
Let him go.

1923
02:02:33,112 --> 02:02:34,253
Just come back!

1924
02:02:34,968 --> 02:02:36,278
- Come on!
- Come on!

1925
02:02:36,279 --> 02:02:37,458
Mikaela, Mikaela!

1926
02:02:37,459 --> 02:02:39,227
- Go with my parents.
- I'm not gonna go with them.

1927
02:02:57,301 --> 02:03:00,040
- We got Jordanians!
- We got help!

1928
02:03:24,161 --> 02:03:25,116
You okay, soldier?

1929
02:03:25,794 --> 02:03:27,174
We're gonna help you,
soldier.

1930
02:03:27,455 --> 02:03:29,262
Let's get being moon
and clear the birds!

1931
02:03:29,297 --> 02:03:30,812
Stay still, stay still.
Don't move.

1932
02:03:31,414 --> 02:03:32,426
You alright, young man?

1933
02:03:32,654 --> 02:03:33,782
- You have a radio?
- Yes.

1934
02:03:35,127 --> 02:03:37,289
Hey kid,
it's been nice knowing you.

1935
02:03:37,472 --> 02:03:39,361
Remember what I did
for my country.

1936
02:03:40,798 --> 02:03:42,277
This is my moment.

1937
02:03:43,479 --> 02:03:44,715
You're crazy!

1938
02:03:46,690 --> 02:03:48,536
ETA to station,
two minutes.

1939
02:03:48,571 --> 02:03:50,431
- Put it on the main screen.
- Sir, yes, sir.

1940
02:03:50,686 --> 02:03:51,719
Predator's air-one.

1941
02:04:02,143 --> 02:04:03,641
Oh shit, it's a trick.

1942
02:04:03,692 --> 02:04:06,141
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.

1943
02:04:06,176 --> 02:04:09,002
- Get those boys out of the ground.
- This is 101 in strike packages.

1944
02:04:09,070 --> 02:04:10,683
Fast course river.
Execute lightly.

1945
02:04:31,004 --> 02:04:33,113
- Spotted Sam.
- Hurry, don't slow up!

1946
02:04:34,151 --> 02:04:35,397
Ironhide!

1947
02:04:36,164 --> 02:04:38,361
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.

1948
02:04:38,496 --> 02:04:38,980
Look out!

1949
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:44,283
Sam, get to the pillars!

1950
02:04:45,557 --> 02:04:46,281
Let's go.

1951
02:04:50,232 --> 02:04:53,668
Oh God, this is it. The pyramids built
right over the machine.

1952
02:04:53,703 --> 02:04:55,172
They turn
that machine on...

1953
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:57,917
no more Sun.

1954
02:05:00,548 --> 02:05:01,943
Not on my watch.

1955
02:05:02,069 --> 02:05:05,110
Not on my watch.

1956
02:05:15,916 --> 02:05:18,844
<i>- USS Stennis, identify.
- Hey, where the hell are you?</i>

1957
02:05:19,032 --> 02:05:19,865
<i>What, you're on
a weather channel?</i>

1958
02:05:19,906 --> 02:05:21,967
<i>Sports center,
high-dreaming TV or something?</i>

1959
02:05:21,997 --> 02:05:23,677
We get a pretty hundred
satellites up there.

1960
02:05:23,767 --> 02:05:26,160
Where the hell
are all our men?

1961
02:05:26,370 --> 02:05:27,938
Identify yourself.

1962
02:05:28,198 --> 02:05:29,535
What is your name, sailor?

1963
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:35,144
Wilder, Captain of the
USS John C. Stennis Aircraft Carrier.

1964
02:05:36,270 --> 02:05:37,837
Okay, Captain Wilder,

1965
02:05:37,826 --> 02:05:40,327
<i>this is Agent Seymour Simmons,
head of the Sector Seven.</i>

1966
02:05:40,438 --> 02:05:42,810
<i>There is a mother of
all non-biologicals</i>

1967
02:05:42,845 --> 02:05:44,639
<i>getting ready
to blow up our Sun.</i>

1968
02:05:44,931 --> 02:05:46,529
You want to have fooled down
about my lack of clearance,

1969
02:05:46,563 --> 02:05:48,808
or you want to help
save a gazillion lives?

1970
02:05:49,442 --> 02:05:51,826
Alright, Agent Simmons.
I'm listening.

1971
02:05:59,035 --> 02:06:00,372
Five klicks.

1972
02:06:00,671 --> 02:06:01,827
<i>West of the gulf.</i>

1973
02:06:01,828 --> 02:06:04,763
<i>We got ourselves a dalion
remodelling a pyramid.</i>

1974
02:06:05,246 --> 02:06:08,250
I want hopes of prototype weapon
pull a rail gun.

1975
02:06:09,613 --> 02:06:10,903
That's classified.

1976
02:06:11,144 --> 02:06:15,011
Don't talk to me
about classified, alright?

1977
02:06:15,046 --> 02:06:16,952
Now if you've got
a battleship in the gulf

1978
02:06:17,696 --> 02:06:20,582
you tell him to ready
that weapon!

1979
02:06:21,594 --> 02:06:24,016
Contact Destroyer,
USS Kit.

1980
02:06:26,356 --> 02:06:28,089
This way!
Move it!

1981
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:31,829
What you need is there.

1982
02:06:32,302 --> 02:06:33,992
Let's go! Go!

1983
02:06:37,813 --> 02:06:39,336
Give me your talk.
Come on.

1984
02:06:39,371 --> 02:06:40,024
Epps!

1985
02:06:44,914 --> 02:06:46,202
Right now,
we need air support.

1986
02:06:47,399 --> 02:06:48,664
That ship's in contact.
20 miles--

1987
02:06:49,133 --> 02:06:51,303
Grid on contact.
Proceed 88, Alpha Sierra.

1988
02:06:55,284 --> 02:06:58,372
USS Stenin 0-9-0,
you are approved to drop a 2,000--

1989
02:07:06,552 --> 02:07:07,835
- What you got?
- A detonator, sir.

1990
02:07:07,836 --> 02:07:09,871
They're 600 minutes away and
they're heading right for the pillars.

1991
02:07:09,906 --> 02:07:10,575
Alright.

1992
02:07:11,317 --> 02:07:12,716
Precious cargo's coming.

1993
02:07:12,995 --> 02:07:13,802
Move!

1994
02:07:40,383 --> 02:07:41,269
Sam!

1995
02:07:41,564 --> 02:07:42,731
Spotted Sam.

1996
02:08:14,884 --> 02:08:15,377
Come on!

1997
02:08:15,426 --> 02:08:18,238
2-2, covering fire.
Two civilians, twelve o'clock.

1998
02:08:26,678 --> 02:08:27,674
Cover for us.

1999
02:08:34,703 --> 02:08:37,683
Okay, air strike.
We'll rescue the civilians.

2000
02:08:57,225 --> 02:08:59,094
Come on. Get up!

2001
02:08:59,527 --> 02:09:00,011
Come on!

2002
02:09:01,316 --> 02:09:02,010
Get in here.

2003
02:09:02,834 --> 02:09:04,015
Oh look
who showed up.

2004
02:09:04,276 --> 02:09:06,372
You better have a good reason
for us to be here.

2005
02:09:06,403 --> 02:09:07,296
Where's Optimus?

2006
02:09:07,525 --> 02:09:09,364
He's right over there,
across the courtyard.

2007
02:09:10,479 --> 02:09:11,360
I got to get to him
right now.

2008
02:09:11,395 --> 02:09:12,815
No, we got
an air strike coming.

2009
02:09:12,816 --> 02:09:14,294
I have to get to him
right now.

2010
02:09:16,378 --> 02:09:17,845
Come here,
b-back.

2011
02:09:27,896 --> 02:09:29,475
Incoming!

2012
02:09:33,464 --> 02:09:36,411
Behold to the only
Jetfire!

2013
02:09:37,604 --> 02:09:41,266
Now let me show you
how we brought them pain in my day.

2014
02:10:01,257 --> 02:10:02,642
Too old
for this crap.

2015
02:10:02,677 --> 02:10:03,697
Keep going.

2016
02:10:03,698 --> 02:10:05,051
15 minutes of fighting.

2017
02:10:25,209 --> 02:10:29,025
I am directly below
the enemy's scrotum.

2018
02:10:29,780 --> 02:10:31,988
<i>25.7 metres
above sea level,</i>

2019
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:33,180
<i>29.32 north.</i>

2020
02:10:33,214 --> 02:10:35,400
- Field track, 5-2, 0500 o'clock.
- Target acquired.

2021
02:10:35,472 --> 02:10:36,463
Killing track two.

2022
02:10:36,884 --> 02:10:38,600
<i>Lock. Fire.</i>

2023
02:10:53,604 --> 02:10:55,567
Yeah! Yeah!

2024
02:10:55,603 --> 02:10:57,537
<i>B-1, stand on my target.
30 seconds...</i>

2025
02:10:59,327 --> 02:11:01,509
We're gonna make a break
for the beast on my command, okay?

2026
02:11:01,559 --> 02:11:03,431
You guys stick with me,
you understand?

2027
02:11:03,466 --> 02:11:04,741
You stay on my ass.

2028
02:11:06,329 --> 02:11:07,987
Hope these F-16s
got good aim.

2029
02:11:08,022 --> 02:11:09,088
Yeah, why is that?

2030
02:11:09,311 --> 02:11:11,143
I told them
to hit the orange smoke.

2031
02:11:12,974 --> 02:11:14,145
You mean
that orange smoke?

2032
02:11:14,617 --> 02:11:16,387
It wasn't my best toss,
okay?

2033
02:11:18,092 --> 02:11:19,622
- Run!
- Run!

2034
02:11:28,102 --> 02:11:29,627
Incoming!

2035
02:11:32,759 --> 02:11:33,354
Come on.

2036
02:12:07,438 --> 02:12:08,368
Die!

2037
02:12:15,347 --> 02:12:16,698
Sam!

2038
02:12:32,774 --> 02:12:34,591
Hold your fire!

2039
02:12:36,832 --> 02:12:37,454
Sam!

2040
02:12:39,534 --> 02:12:41,835
Get out!
Get me an EVAC.

2041
02:12:43,870 --> 02:12:46,018
Can't you do something?

2042
02:13:21,129 --> 02:13:23,192
- Sam! Sam...
- Sam!

2043
02:13:29,870 --> 02:13:32,389
Come on, we got to move.
We got to move! Come on!

2044
02:13:37,505 --> 02:13:38,461
Sammy!

2045
02:13:42,308 --> 02:13:45,641
Clear! Take a shot.
Clear! Take a shot.

2046
02:13:45,676 --> 02:13:46,999
One, two, three.

2047
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:50,744
Do it again.

2048
02:13:56,562 --> 02:13:58,405
Sam!

2049
02:14:00,245 --> 02:14:05,391
Okay, listen to my voice.
I love you and I need you.

2050
02:14:06,225 --> 02:14:11,584
Please, please come back to me.
Sam, please! I love you!

2051
02:14:23,353 --> 02:14:25,178
Am I dead?

2052
02:14:25,969 --> 02:14:30,279
We have been watching you.
A long, long time.

2053
02:14:32,569 --> 02:14:34,624
You have fought
for Optimus,

2054
02:14:34,797 --> 02:14:39,287
our last descendant,
with courage and with sacrifice.

2055
02:14:39,322 --> 02:14:41,947
The virtues of a leader.

2056
02:14:42,403 --> 02:14:45,516
A leader
worthy of our secret.

2057
02:14:45,827 --> 02:14:48,723
The Matrix of Leadership
is not found.

2058
02:14:49,246 --> 02:14:50,663
It is earned.

2059
02:14:51,759 --> 02:14:54,041
Return now to Optimus,

2060
02:14:54,673 --> 02:14:56,915
merge the Matrix
with his Spark.

2061
02:14:57,608 --> 02:15:02,304
It is, and always has been,
your destiny.

2062
02:15:07,109 --> 02:15:08,094
Sam.

2063
02:15:15,784 --> 02:15:17,034
I love you.

2064
02:15:54,658 --> 02:15:57,566
Boy, you returned
for me.

2065
02:15:59,015 --> 02:16:01,030
A living Prime!

2066
02:16:02,558 --> 02:16:04,996
I don't believe it.

2067
02:16:15,179 --> 02:16:17,578
My Matrix.

2068
02:16:23,056 --> 02:16:24,357
Get up, get up,
get up, get up.

2069
02:16:25,574 --> 02:16:26,844
Get up, Prime!

2070
02:16:28,636 --> 02:16:32,137
- Oh, no.
- He's turned on the machine.

2071
02:16:32,942 --> 02:16:34,664
You gotta stop him.
Get up!

2072
02:16:34,986 --> 02:16:36,538
Optimus!

2073
02:16:38,623 --> 02:16:41,097
Fallen, my master.

2074
02:16:41,269 --> 02:16:45,601
My brothers could not
stop me from this.

2075
02:16:46,616 --> 02:16:51,169
- Yes.
- Now I claim your sun.

2076
02:16:54,031 --> 02:16:55,700
Enemy target,
top of pyramid.

2077
02:16:55,702 --> 02:16:57,855
Engage,
engage, engage.

2078
02:17:03,221 --> 02:17:06,141
In moments,
we'll be at siren strength.

2079
02:17:21,950 --> 02:17:26,405
I never did a thing
worth doing until now.

2080
02:17:27,089 --> 02:17:29,866
Optimus,
take my parts.

2081
02:17:30,079 --> 02:17:32,986
And you'll have a power
you've never known.

2082
02:17:33,902 --> 02:17:36,076
Fulfill your destiny.

2083
02:17:42,116 --> 02:17:44,371
Jolt, electrify!

2084
02:18:04,958 --> 02:18:06,608
Let's roll.

2085
02:18:09,073 --> 02:18:10,923
Fire. Take it off
to the pyramid!

2086
02:18:22,983 --> 02:18:26,626
This planet
will be dark forever.

2087
02:18:48,982 --> 02:18:51,225
Die
like your brother.

2088
02:18:51,830 --> 02:18:54,142
They were
your brothers too.

2089
02:19:22,776 --> 02:19:25,061
First gra--

2090
02:19:37,963 --> 02:19:40,022
You picked
the wrong planet!

2091
02:19:42,961 --> 02:19:44,957
Give me your face.

2092
02:19:53,428 --> 02:19:57,560
I rise.
You fall.

2093
02:19:59,659 --> 02:20:02,852
No. No.

2094
02:20:04,340 --> 02:20:09,086
Not to call you a coward, Master,
but sometimes,

2095
02:20:09,087 --> 02:20:12,807
cowards do survive.

2096
02:20:13,339 --> 02:20:15,275
This isn't over.

2097
02:20:42,729 --> 02:20:45,554
You took all of this for you
to tell me that you love me.

2098
02:20:47,274 --> 02:20:48,747
You said it first.

2099
02:21:40,175 --> 02:21:42,590
Thank you, Sam,
for saving my life.

2100
02:21:44,049 --> 02:21:44,601
You're welcome.

2101
02:21:46,079 --> 02:21:47,813
Thank you
for believing in me.

2102
02:21:52,536 --> 02:21:57,179
<i>Our races united by a history
long forgotten.</i>

2103
02:21:57,180 --> 02:22:00,485
<i>And a future
we shall face together.</i>

2104
02:22:01,209 --> 02:22:05,470
<i>I am Optimus Prime,
and I send this message</i>

2105
02:22:05,505 --> 02:22:08,745
<i>so that our past
will always be remembered.</i>

2106
02:22:08,746 --> 02:22:12,659
<i>For in those memories,
we live on.</i>

2107
02:22:36,447 --> 02:22:39,185
so glad you can join us
professoe Einstein

2108
02:22:39,746 --> 02:22:41,166
yeah, im a kind of busy

2109
02:22:44,598 --> 02:22:45,541
OK
