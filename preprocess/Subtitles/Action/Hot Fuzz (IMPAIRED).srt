and, now, now he's gone somewhere.

1220
01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:34,138
Up to the... To the castle, I think.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go after him.

1221
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:36,460
Okay? It's Nicholas, by the way.

1222
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:42,782
Oh, my God.
What happened to your Peace Lily?

1223
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:46,784
Danny. Danny, just stay here, okay?
And watch him, and call your dad.

1224
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:48,861
- Tell him I was right.
- What are you gonna do?

1225
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:53,387
- I'm gonna bust this thing wide open.
- Nicholas, wait.

1226
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:57,065
- You might need this.
- Thanks, partner.

Now, quick announcement before we begin.

1241
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:10,148
Janet Barker has decided
to call her boys Roger and Martin.

1242
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:15,304
And the christening will be
a week on Saturday and we're all invited.

1243
01:17:15,550 --> 01:17:17,780
- Tom.
- Thanks, Joyce.

1244
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:20,982
Now, you'll all be delighted to hear

1245
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:25,541
that the tenacious Sergeant Angel
has been taken care of.

1246
01:17:25,630 --> 01:17:30,988
Joyce will discover the Sergeant lying
on the wet floor of his bathroom,

1247
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:35,143
having slipped
and tragically broken his neck.

1248
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:37,221
So, with the dispatch of the Sergeant,

1249
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:41,223
we will now be able to concentrate
on the eradication of our hoodie infestation.

1250
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:42,345
Quite right.

1251
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:45,740
After which, nothing will stand in our way.

1252
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:48,583
Oh, I beg to differ, Mr Weaver.

1253
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:52,743
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.

1254
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:56,107
Sergeant Nicholas Angel.
Sandford Police Service.

1255
01:17:56,190 --> 01:17:58,829
My, he is tenacious, isn't he?

1256
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:01,663
I'm arresting you under suspicion
of conspiracy to commit murder.

1257
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:04,423
Oh, come, come, Sergeant.

1258
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:06,023
You should be ashamed.

1259
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:09,546
- Calling yourself a community that cares.
- Oh, but we do care, Nicholas.

1260
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:11,302
It's all about the greater good.

1261
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,823
ALL: The greater good.

1262
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:14,343
How can this be for the greater good?

01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:15,909
ALL: The greater good.

1264
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:18,026
You see, as much as I enjoyed
your wild theories, Sergeant,

1265
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,748
the truth is far less complex.

1266
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:24,824
Blower's fate was simply the result
of his being an appalling actor.

1267
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:27,464
ALL: Quite appalling.

1268
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:29,222
You murdered him for that?

1269
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:32,579
- Well, he murdered Bill Shakespeare.
- What?

1270
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:36,026
The Dramatic Society
is an important feather in our cap.

1271
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:37,749
<i>HATCHER: Couldn't let
Blower jeopardise that.</i>

1272
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:39,980
Not when we had two semi-professionals
waiting in the wings.

1273
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:42,538
<i>Let's not forget that Greg
was an extra in Straw Dogs.</i>

1274
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:44,427
<i>And Sheree played a cadaver
in Prime Suspect.</i>

1275
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:45,863
Yes, I know!

1276
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:48,464
Martin was less concerned
with the reputation of the village

1277
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:51,622
than he was with his sordid affair
with Eve Draper.

1278
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:53,223
And so Eve deserved to die too?

1279
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:55,619
Well, she did have a very annoying laugh.

1280
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:56,904
ALL: Annoying.

1281
01:18:56,990 --> 01:18:59,709
- And, and George Merchant?
- He had an awful house.

1282
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:01,025
ALL: Awful.

1283
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:02,702
We begged him in vain
to make his residence

1284
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:05,224
more in keeping
with the village's rustic aesthetic.

1285
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:08,738
And what about Tim Messenger?
What was his crime?

1286
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:13,346
<i>Tim Messenger's tenure as editor of
the Sandford Citizen has been unbearable.</i>

1287
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:17,105
Our once great paper had
become riddled with tabloid journalism.

1288
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:19,067
<i>Not to mention persistent errors.</i>

1289
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:22,267
- He listed her age as 55.
- When, actually, I'm 53.

1290
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:23,783
Fifty-three.

1291
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:25,462
What, what about Leslie Tiller?
One of your own?

1292
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:27,939
Her horticultural expertise helped
put Sandford on the map.

1293
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:29,986
Oh, she was ever so good.

1294
01:19:30,070 --> 01:19:32,140
Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.

1295
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:35,979
But it seemed she was set on moving away.

1296
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:39,301
We couldn't have her sharing
her green fingers with anybody else.

1297
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:41,267
Not least those heathens at Buford Abbey.

1298
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:43,910
If we can't have her, no one can.

1299
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:45,503
How can this be for the greater good?

1300
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:47,546
- ALL: The greater good.
- Shut it!

1301
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:50,667
These people died for no reason.
No reason whatsoever!

1302
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:53,139
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1303
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:56,149
Hello, Nicholas.

1304
01:19:57,190 --> 01:19:59,021
I was like you once.

1305
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:02,906
I believed in the immutable word of the law.

1306
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:06,865
That is until the night Mrs Butterman
was taken from me.

1307
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:10,310
You see,
no one loved Sandford more than her.

1308
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:14,224
She was head of the Women's Institute,
chair of the floral committee.

1309
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,301
When they started
the Village of the Year contest,

1310
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:19,939
she worked round the clock.
I've never seen such dedication.

1311
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:26,350
On the eve of the adjudicator's arrival,
some travellers moved into Callahan Park.

1312
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:30,500
Before you could say, "Gypsy scum,"
we were knee-deep in dog muck,

1313
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:32,820
thieving kids and crusty jugglers.

1314
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:34,582
ALL: Crusty jugglers.

1315
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:37,628
We lost the title and Irene lost her mind.

1316
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:42,543
She drove her Datsun Cherry
into Sandford Gorge.

1317
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:47,545
From that moment on,
I swore that I would do her proud.

1318
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:52,182
And whatever the cost,
we would make Sandford great again.

1319
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:54,307
Sir, this doesn't make any sense.

1320
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:58,099
The adjudicators arrive tomorrow.
We had to get everything ready.

1321
01:20:58,190 --> 01:21:00,784
Are you saying this is all about
winning the Best Village Award?

1322
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:04,419
This is the best village, Nicholas.
You've seen the people.

1323
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:08,788
- They're happy, contented.
- They're living in a dream world.

1324
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:11,384
Sergeant Popwell
thought much the same as you.

1325
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:13,426
I'm disappointed
you can't see the bigger picture.

1326
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:15,819
Well, I'm happy to disappoint you, sir.

1327
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:17,582
And I'm afraid
you're gonna have to come with me.

1328
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:19,661
You are all gonna have to come with me.

1329
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:23,663

Back off! Back off!

1333

you'll be explaining how Danny tripped over

1334
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:44,989
and accidentally cut off his own head.

1335
