1
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:17,145
Most days I get by fine,
and blend with the crowd,

2
00:00:17,232 --> 00:00:21,645
just another one of the huddled masses
yearning to get by unnoticed.

3
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:30,991
Problemo is,
I'm not as like them as I'd like to be.

4
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:33,651
I got made, not born.

5
00:00:34,706 --> 00:00:36,782
And because it was humans made me,

6
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:41,204
somewhere along the line,
a coupla wires got crossed in my head.

7
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:44,130
Someone botched the job.

8
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:46,622
So, some days, that's how I feel:

9
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:49,965
a botched job.

10
00:00:55,016 --> 00:00:57,768
Hey.
You're in luck.

11
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:00,769
Thank God.
Stuff's getting hard to find.

12
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:05,314
One thing I don't get.

13
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:08,650
Tryptophan? It's just a food supplement.

14
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:11,738
And you're acting
like a junkie who scored a fix.

15
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,314
Girl needs her amino acids.

16
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:19,030
Are you OK?
I will be.

17
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:23,166
(mobile phone)
Oh! Gotta blaze. You're a life-saver.

18
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,462
Hiya.
You paged me?

19
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,129
I thought you might
wanna join me for dinner.

20
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:44,889
I don't wanna put you to any trouble.
Well, it's nothing fancy.

21
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:50,019
Just one of my run-of-the-mill,
spur-of-the-moment culinary miracles.

22
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:53,598
I'm not real hungry. Feeling kinda punk.

23
00:01:53,694 --> 00:01:54,939
Ah.

24
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:59,192
A glass of pre-Pulse
Tokay Pinot Gris'll cure what ails ya.

25
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,368
Now you have to stay.

26
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:06,703
Even you shouldn't be
wandering around during a brownout.

27
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:09,706
I've got a wicked headache as it is.

28
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,247
There was a time
when this city actually worked.

29
00:02:12,336 --> 00:02:14,209
Or so they say.

30
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,835
What were you doing when the Pulse hit?

31
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:23,629
On my uncle's yacht, motoring into Friday
Harbor on Orcas Island with a lady friend.

32
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:25,797
Why does that not surprise me?

33
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,470
I knew the end of the world was coming
when the SatNav crashed, and, uh...

34
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:32,470
we ran aground.

35
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:33,309
How about you?

36
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:35,729
Hey! You kids out here?

37
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,861
Hiding under the stairs.

38
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:44,318
I was staying with this foster family.

39
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:48,653
There were two of us,
me and this girl Lucy. She was older.

40
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:53,284
Her dad was a drunk.
He'd smack us around pretty good.

41
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:58,157
He was watching a game, and when
the TV went off because of The Pulse...

42
00:02:58,252 --> 00:03:00,790
(man) You kids are gonna learn a lesson!

43
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:06,043
...he came looking for
someone to blame it on.

44
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:12,548
It's hard to imagine a
genetically enhanced

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,593
killing machine like you
putting up with that.

46
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:21,227
I was trying to fit in, you know?
Act like a normal kid.

47
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:26,437
Global chaos seemed as good a reason
as any to bail on a bad situation.

48
00:03:26,528 --> 00:03:28,816
So I did.

49
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:33,948
You OK?
Like I said, I'm not feeling so hot.

50
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,610
It's pretty bad this time, huh?

51
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:44,073
Every once in a while, I hit a rough patch.

52
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,910
Usually the tryptophan helps, but...

53
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:51,375
these seizures are much
stronger than usual.

54
00:03:57,514 --> 00:04:00,598
Should I call a doctor?
What are you gonna tell him?

55
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:05,144
That your genetically engineered friend
has a design flaw in her brain chemistry?

56
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:08,183
That stuff really helps?
It supplements the serotonin

57
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:10,978
that my brain's
supposed to make but doesn't.

58
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:13,737
When the levels are low, I have a seizure.

59
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:17,401
I'm supposed to be a revved-up girl.

60
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:21,447
Truth is, I'm a lemon.

61
00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:26,159
I don't know about that.

62
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:33,744
What can I do?

63
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:36,958
Stay with me. Please?
I'm right here.

64
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:43,965
You won't leave?
I'm not goin' anywhere.

65
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,196
I put the money in an envelope, I put the
envelope in this box, and now it's gone.

66
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:52,365
You know, I could take it out in trade...

67
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:55,487
But I'm a married man.
You're a pillar of virtue, Walter.

68
00:05:55,578 --> 00:06:00,074
Your wife's a lucky woman.
Hey! You don't suppose somebody stole it?

69
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,451
I don't know what else happened to it.
Oh, that's tough luck.

70
00:06:03,544 --> 00:06:07,376
Crime rate in this city's getting
way outta hand. But if I don't get paid,

71
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:13,217
you and everybody on this floor is gonna
be sleeping out on the street tonight.

72
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:15,876
We've been robbed.
The payoff money is missing.

73
00:06:15,972 --> 00:06:18,297
I took it.
Oh, thank God.

74
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:21,806
Excuse me, I'm waiting.
Don't got it.

75
00:06:22,353 --> 00:06:24,559
What?
I spent it.

76
00:06:24,646 --> 00:06:27,600
You spent it?
All right, come on. You're trespassing.

77
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:30,775
Hold the phone, Walter!
You'll get your payola, OK?

78
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,110
Anyway, you're three days early.
Times are tough.

79
00:06:34,197 --> 00:06:37,197
You'll get it in the morning.

80
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,691
You got 24 hours.

81
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:46,204
What do you mean, you spent it?
I had to buy something.

82
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:50,784
You helped yourself to money
I collected from everyone on the floor?

83
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,001
A short-term loan.
You could have asked.

84
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:55,128
It was an emergency.
Yeah, right.

85
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:57,706
Walter will get his money, so chill!

86
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,543
Just... What is wrong with you?

87
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:12,059
Where have you been?
None of your business.

88
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:15,148
It ain't like I care,
but we've all been covering for you.

89
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:19,729
Normal's on the warpath.
Well, well, well. Your moron colleagues

90
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:21,989
have come up with the
following excuses for

91
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:24,281
why you're strolling in
at the crack of noon:

92
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:26,525
you had a dental emergency,

93
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:31,576
your aunt died-again,
and my personal favorite, from this idiot,

94
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:35,912
you were detained by the sector police
for practicing witchcraft.

95
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:41,547
Now, would you care
to further insult my intelligence?

96
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:44,419
I overslept.

97
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,001
I thought you didn't sleep.
I usually don't.

98
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:50,298
My body probably needed to catch up.

99
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,426
Yes, well, catch up in
your own time, girlie.

100
00:07:54,894 --> 00:07:57,266
Get outta here. Go!

101
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,849
Hey. I need to borrow some money,
just until tomorrow.

102
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:06,193
I shouldn't even be
speaking to you after last night.

103
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,980
You stood me up.
I wasn't feeling well.

104
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:12,565
You coulda called, 'stead
of leaving me solo.

105
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,037
I spaced, so get off my back, OK?
What is your dealio today?

106
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,873
You don't wanna know.
So how about that loan?

107
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,953
Outta chips, baby girl.

108
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,385
(man #1) Please! I no have money.

109
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:41,554
Wrong answer. How do you want it?
Regular, or extra crispy?

110
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:44,764
I no have money! I no have money!

111
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:48,066
(speaks in Chinese)

112
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:02,403
Hey.

113
00:09:02,497 --> 00:09:04,988
What's up?
Come here.

114
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:13,088
What's your name, doll face?
Are you a playa playa from the Himalayas?

115
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:14,584
Yeah. Yeah, that's me.

116
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:17,592
I gotta whisper it, cos it's kinda dopey.

117
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:23,511
Out you go!

118
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,893
Come on! It's brand-spankin'-new!

119
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,313
What happens when the gangsters
come lookin' for their ride?

120
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,685
It'll be in a million pieces by then.
Like I'm gonna end up.

121
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:40,816
I'll give you $1,000 for it.
You're killin' me!

122
00:09:40,906 --> 00:09:43,278
It's the best I can do.

123
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:44,084
Deal.

124
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:46,284
I'll have the money
for you in the morning.

125
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,821
I need the money now.
I don't have that much lyin' around.

126
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:52,656
Tomorrow.
First thing?

127
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:07,544
Hey, guys.
Max, we need to talk.

128
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:11,056
I'll have the money in the morning, OK?

129
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:21,101
You're not gonna find it.
You got a problem, boo.

130
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:24,857
But Kendra and me got your back.
Because we love you very much.

131
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:27,437
Where are my pills?

132
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:30,568
I wish you could see yourself.
The temper, the mood swings.

133
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:33,993
Not showing up when you're supposed to.
Stealing money.

134
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,748
I needed it for medicine
cos I'm not feelin' well.

135
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:39,868
Cos you're strung out. Straight-up jonesed.

136
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:44,037
Where are they?
Take it easy! It's gonna be OK.

137
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,127
No! No, it's not. I need that stuff.
What you need is help.

138
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:52,048
And to live your life one day at a time.
Get yourself on a Twelve Step, boo.

139
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:55,470
The programme works if you work it.
Believe me, I know.

140
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:57,715
Really? What was your DOC?

141
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:01,177
Tattoos. I was covered with them.
I looked like a Christmas tree.

142
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,891
Couldn't stop myself.
Where'd they go?

143
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:06,732
The 13th step is having 'em lasered off.

144
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,193
I'll die without that medicine.
Now tell me where you put it.

145
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,442
Down the toilet, which is where
your life is headed if you don't clean up.

146
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:19,198
Tell me you didn't.
Someday you'll thank us.

147
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,790
I think that went about as well
as could be expected.

148
00:11:28,878 --> 00:11:31,879
As interventions go, that was a home run.

149
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:47,723
I need more tryptophan.
Already?

150
00:11:47,812 --> 00:11:50,932
Long story.
And I can't pay you until tomorrow.

151
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:53,941
I know you're good for the money,
but I don't have any.

152
00:11:54,026 --> 00:11:55,935
Do you know anywhere else I can go?

153
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:57,901
Sorry.
Where do you get yours?

154
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,148
I'll put myself out of business
as a middleman if I reveal my supplier.

155
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:04,115
Where do you get it?
Take it easy.

156
00:12:04,202 --> 00:12:05,779
Tell me.

157
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:10,198
A doctor over at Metro Medical
gives it to some of his patients.

158
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:12,746
I know an orderly there.

159
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:46,979
Get me Security.

160
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:01,411
What were you doing in there?
Looking for a bathroom.

161
00:13:01,503 --> 00:13:03,295
Uh-uh-uh. Security's on the way.

162
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,500
Since when is it against the law
for a girl to make sissy?

163
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:13,379
Get her!
Hey!

164
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,970
You junkie skeeze.

165
00:13:36,243 --> 00:13:39,160
Have you been working out?

166
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:42,282
You look like you lost some weight.

167
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:44,864
Here you go -just the way you like it.

168
00:13:47,837 --> 00:13:51,881
About the money, Walter.
You gotta give us one more day. Please?

169
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:55,002
I already gave you one more day.

170
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:58,177
Squatters on the seventh floor.
I need backup right away.

171
00:13:58,263 --> 00:14:00,754
Roger. Out.
Good coffee.

172
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:07,472
All right, I need everybody outside.
Here we go. Single file. Right now.

173
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:10,018
She took the money and split? That...

174
00:14:10,858 --> 00:14:12,815
doesn't sound like Max.

175
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:15,570
Do you have a place to stay?
My sister's. You?

176
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,191
I dunno. Maybe I can crash
at Original Cindy's.

177
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:20,481
Mama.
Sh. It's all right, baby.

178
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:24,239
Come on. It's all right.
All right, people, let's move it out.

179
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:27,198
What about our stuff?

180
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:31,579
Probably end up getting sold
off the back of a truck.

181
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:36,122
(siren)

182
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:05,107
Are you OK?
Mind your own business.

183
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:09,366
If you ralph, it's going to be my business.

184
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:13,612
Here.

185
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:18,913
Clean yourself up. You wanna look good
when they take your picture, don't ya?

186
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,043
Go to your right.

187
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,505
Turn and face left.

188
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,001
Next.

189
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,384
It's showtime.

190
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:39,225
Hands.

191
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:44,145
Let's go.

192
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:46,981
Hands on the desk and, uh...

193
00:15:48,028 --> 00:15:50,317
feet apart, huh?

194
00:15:53,116 --> 00:15:55,405
Pretty lady, huh?

195
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:01,410
Set of keys.

196
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,413
Lip balm, cherry-flavored.

197
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:09,289
Pack of chewing gum, also cherry-flavored.

198
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,665
And some small bills, totaling...

199
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:17,293
21 dollars.
Try 75, if you can count!

200
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:20,009
I told you to keep your hands on the desk.

201
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:22,768
See, I bet you're used to this, aren't you?

202
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:26,801
How much does a strung-out little
sleazebag tramp like you go for these days?

203
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:29,566
Ask your wife.

204
00:16:31,943 --> 00:16:35,358
What'd you say?
Twenty to life.

205
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:38,052
That's what she oughta
get, if you ask me.

206
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,111
Yeah, I didn't.

207
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,358
Get him outta here, huh?

208
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:43,359
Come on.

209
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,660
God, it's something dead.

210
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:49,990
Smells like Sketchy's locker.

211
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:51,958
I'm thinking feet.
Dead feet.

212
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,579
Is there a problem here?
What does this smell like to you?

213
00:16:55,673 --> 00:17:00,334
That smells like a package that
should've been delivered by now, moron.

214
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,175
Excuse me, is Max around?

215
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,720
Excellent question.
Where the firetruck's Max?

216
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:10,513
Um, Max is one of three
finalists selected...

217
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:14,137
Never mind. Sorry I asked.
I'm sorry. Can't help you.

218
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:21,559
Any ideas? I've been
paging her all morning.

219
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:24,359
Maybe she don't wanna talk to you.
Sorry?

220
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:28,233
She's off the candy.
Uh, you're losing me here.

221
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:32,111
Like I didn't notice that all the
stuff started when you and her met.

222
00:17:32,205 --> 00:17:34,114
OK, I'm officially lost.

223
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,413
I know all about rich guys like you,

224
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:39,336
turning a girl out,
making her into your strawberry.

225
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,334
Original Cindy took the drugs
you gave Max, and flushed 'em.

226
00:17:43,424 --> 00:17:45,915
What drugs?
"What drugs?"

227
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,919
Hey!

228
00:17:48,011 --> 00:17:51,510
The pills you got Max hooked on.
They're with the Tidy Bowl Man now.

229
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:55,595
You flushed her pills down the toilet?
Mm-hm. Homegirl don't need 'em.

230
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:58,937
Max has a neurological condition.
Huh!

231
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:01,726
Those pills are the only thing that help.

232
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:04,437
She didn't mention
no neurological condition.

233
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:09,484
Well, she wouldn't advertise it. It's
Logan. I need you to do something for me.

234
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:21,284
Come on. Maybe there's
an open cell in the back.

235
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,907
Stay close to me, and
no matter what anybody says...

236
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,873
¡Oye! Mamacita.
...don't talk back.

237
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:32,082
Name's Break.
Max.

238
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:36,088
What are you in for?
I love saying that. It sounds so tough.

239
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,015
Robbery.
Mmm, a real criminal.

240
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:41,969
How about you?
Cannibalism. I ate my parents.

241
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,515
Good source of protein.

242
00:18:44,604 --> 00:18:48,850
Go that way. Actually, I run
a little shop on Melbourne Avenue.

243
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:51,646
Vintage clothes-pre-Pulse stuff.

244
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:56,652
Hung a poster in my window
for a police brutality protest.

245
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,444
Bonehead move.
Yeah. They busted me for it.

246
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:02,382
Wasn't the first time,
and it won't be the

247
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:05,453
last. But stay strong
in the struggle, right?

248
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:09,074
Guess we camp out on the floor.
Good a place as any.

249
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:18,049
Are you OK?
Yeah, it's just a nerve thing.

250
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,218
Can I do anything?

251
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,960
I'd give my ass and hat
for a glass of milk.

252
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:25,972
I could use a vodka tonic, but...
here we are.

253
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:30,976
It has tryptophan in it.
Whatever that is.

254
00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:34,763
It takes the edge off.
So you think I can get some?

255
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:37,431
What, vodka?
No, milk.

256
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:40,895
Well... let me see what I can rustle up.

257
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:45,190
I have a business arrangement
with a guard I met my first time in here.

258
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,572
He has a thing for stiletto heels.

259
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:52,156
He made my previous stay more pleasant,
and when I got out, I reciprocated.

260
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:54,122
With shoes for his girl?

261
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:56,911
Not unless she wears a size 12.

262
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:59,625
Oh. Got ya.

263
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:25,774
Eyes front!

264
00:20:59,183 --> 00:21:01,935
Do what you can. Thanks, Matt.

265
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:03,870
What's up?

266
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:06,844
A friend of mine in
the police department.

267
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,689
You got friends in strange places.
A woman matching Max's description

268
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:14,609
was arrested trying to break into
a hospital pharmacy last night.

269
00:21:14,697 --> 00:21:18,481
They took her to Langford.
We've gotta get her out.

270
00:21:18,576 --> 00:21:22,241
Paying off people'll take three days.
She doesn't have that much time.

271
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:26,742
What does that mean?
No meds, seizures get bad enough...

272
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:30,283
she could go into a coma and die.

273
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:37,926
He even warmed it up.

274
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,761
That's the way it comes out, my love.

275
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:43,965
Guy's got a goat on the
next cell block over.

276
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:46,976
Hey, do you think
there's a way out to the yard?

277
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,681
Yeah, but they don't let
anyone out after curfew.

278
00:21:50,104 --> 00:21:53,971
There's too many rules in here.
I'm going home.

279
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:59,482
Well, don't let those big, tall fences
with the razor wire on top stop you.

280
00:21:59,571 --> 00:22:01,777
I won't.

281
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:04,616
Or the sharpshooters in the guard towers.

282
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:07,156
I've broken out of worse places than this.

283
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:10,448
Look, the toughette routine
might work with the boys,

284
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,864
but you could get yourself killed.

285
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:16,409
Comin' with me?
Thank you, no. I have a date tonight.

286
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,330
The shoe guy?
Mm-hm.

287
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,248
Cute.

288
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,293
You won't think so
when he's shooting at you.

289
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,136
Go, go.

290
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:41,479
More spotlights than a movie premiere.
Looks like I'm gonna need a diversion.

291
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:45,778
You leave it to me. If there's one thing
I'm good at, it's drawing attention.

292
00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:49,314
You sure I can't talk you out of this?
Here.

293
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:52,325
So you don't forget me.
Thanks for the milk.

294
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:10,801
? La donna è mobile

295
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:13,802
? Qual piuma al vento

296
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:17,091
? Muta d'accento

297
00:23:17,183 --> 00:23:18,178
Hey!

298
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:21,552
? E di pensiero

299
00:23:21,645 --> 00:23:24,432
? Sempre un amabile

300
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:27,274
? Qual piuma al vento

301
00:23:27,942 --> 00:23:33,363
? In pianto o in riso, è menzognero

302
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:35,274
Back inside! It's after curfew.

303
00:23:37,076 --> 00:23:38,819
(klaxon)

304
00:23:42,414 --> 00:23:43,991
Knock it off!

305
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,621
Get down! Get off that fence!

306
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,201
I said knock it off!

307
00:23:58,178 --> 00:24:02,306
(continues to sing)
I don't like opera!

308
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,548
What have you got, gentlemen?

309
00:24:41,342 --> 00:24:44,508
Put the key under the
flowerpot by the door.

310
00:24:45,554 --> 00:24:49,468
Kendra, don't even go there.
You can stay as long as you need to.

311
00:24:49,557 --> 00:24:52,392
I've got some ideas on
how to handle that cop on the take.

312
00:24:52,477 --> 00:24:54,469
Hear that?

313
00:24:54,562 --> 00:24:56,519
She says you the man.

314
00:24:56,605 --> 00:24:58,894
Peace. I'm out.

315
00:25:02,778 --> 00:25:05,447
I take it back.
What?

316
00:25:06,448 --> 00:25:09,282
The dis on you from before. I'm sorry.

317
00:25:12,036 --> 00:25:15,037
You all right.
No problem.

318
00:25:16,165 --> 00:25:18,453
You like her, don't you?

319
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:20,783
Who?
Max.

320
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:23,544
She's a good girl.

321
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:28,087
Here's my guy.

322
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:41,141
Any luck?
Sorry it took so long.

323
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:44,763
Had to call in a few favors
to get into the evidence locker.

324
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:47,063
I owe ya.

325
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:50,068
Why was your friend
trying to steal that stuff anyway?

326
00:25:50,154 --> 00:25:52,905
It's complicated.

327
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:57,318
Listen, there's... one more thing
I need your help with.

328
00:25:58,328 --> 00:26:02,325
Let go of me, you rat-soup-slurpin',
wrinkle-ass, pepper gut,

329
00:26:02,415 --> 00:26:07,491
no-good, skank-lovin', donut-eatin',
people-oppressin', po-po son of a bitch!

330
00:26:07,586 --> 00:26:10,373
All right, what's the charge?
Solicitation.

331
00:26:10,464 --> 00:26:12,088
Try "participation".

332
00:26:12,173 --> 00:26:14,629
First he busts, then arrests me.

333
00:26:14,717 --> 00:26:17,801
Had to be sure a criminal violation
had occurred, didn't I?

334
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:20,923
Pig.
Hands on the counter, legs apart.

335
00:26:21,974 --> 00:26:24,891
Don't even think about messing up my do!

336
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:45,989
Where am I?
Warden's house.

337
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:51,705
Don't get your hopes up.
You're still inside the wire.

338
00:26:51,792 --> 00:26:55,078
What's your name?
Max.

339
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:58,583
Maria. I heard you tried to escape.

340
00:26:59,424 --> 00:27:02,840
Yeah. Turns out
they frown on that kind of thing.

341
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:08,512
Looks like they got you pretty good.
Do you work here?

342
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:12,597
I was living in the jail with my mom
when the riot happened.

343
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:17,310
She got killed.
The Warden and his wife took me in.

344
00:27:18,358 --> 00:27:20,849
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here.

345
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:26,314
When you're feeling better,
you can help me with the housework.

346
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:29,822
There's not a lot.
Just the Warden and his wife.

347
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,777
The food's way better here,
and you can have as much as you want.

348
00:27:33,872 --> 00:27:36,197
That's where I sleep,

349
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:40,158
so at night, you and me
can stay up late and talk.

350
00:27:40,962 --> 00:27:43,452
And with you here, maybe he...

351
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:47,295
What?
(woman) Maria!

352
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:52,052
I'd better get back to work.
I'll check on you later.

353
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,856
Come on, come on.

354
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:10,894
Bingo!

355
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,658
OK, they put her in cell block G4.

356
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:21,539
G4. Same block.
They got Max's photo in the records.

357
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:25,573
Yeah, she's one girl who
can't afford to be photographed.

358
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,371
Got a thing for this girl, don't ya?

359
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:35,799
Why does everybody keep saying that?

360
00:28:42,976 --> 00:28:45,052
Hey!

361
00:28:45,561 --> 00:28:48,562
Where'd you get that?
What's it to you?

362
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:51,020
This is Max's!
You know her?

363
00:28:51,108 --> 00:28:53,720
I'm her home girl. If
you touched one hair...

364
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,853
Take it easy. I'm
her home girl too.

365
00:28:55,946 --> 00:28:58,982
She gave this to me
before she tried to bust outta here.

366
00:28:59,074 --> 00:29:02,359
Where is she?
I heard they took her to the Warden's.

367
00:29:03,536 --> 00:29:07,616
Well, I've got to get this to her-fast.

368
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:12,793
Well, that is a problem, because
you are here, and she is there.

369
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:17,548
Well, we've got to figure out how
to get me to her, or she's gonna die.

370
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:20,123
And that's the straight-up truth.

371
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:24,126
Do you do windows?

372
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,018
You don't look too good.

373
00:29:42,196 --> 00:29:44,484
How are you feeling?

374
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:51,323
Stay out of his way, Maxie,
or he'll start with you, too.

375
00:29:55,374 --> 00:30:00,285
I'm sorry, Lucy.
I shouldn't have gone without you.

376
00:30:18,562 --> 00:30:21,313
I knew what was happening,

377
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:23,971
but I didn't stop him.

378
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:31,607
At Manticore, they used
to teach us a lesson.

379
00:30:32,616 --> 00:30:36,032
You will engage an adversary
only if it is consistent

380
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,491
with your overall strategic objective.

381
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,995
Failing that,
you will initiate a tactical withdrawal.

382
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,707
So I ran away.

383
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:48,293
I left you there... with him.

384
00:30:53,969 --> 00:30:55,926
Maria.

385
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:21,284
No.

386
00:31:24,163 --> 00:31:27,163
Leave her alone!

387
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:34,834
I'll clean it up.

388
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:44,593
Sick bastard.
I was tired of her anyway.

389
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:48,091
Why do you think you're here?

390
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,529
Can we move back in now?

391
00:32:06,617 --> 00:32:11,658
Asking a police officer to accept a bribe
so you can trespass on private property -

392
00:32:11,747 --> 00:32:13,870
that's gonna cost you an extra $150.

393
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:26,582
Dirtbag.

394
00:32:26,677 --> 00:32:29,382
Mr Lydecker? It's Vogelsang.

395
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:33,848
I got a call from a contact of mine
who works as a bull over at Langford.

396
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:38,227
I put the word out that anyone that
comes through with a bar code tattooed,

397
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:41,017
he should drop a dime and, well, he did.

398
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:47,444
Well, one of the inmates, a girl,
she tried to escape last night.

399
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:51,740
Almost made it. See, Mr Lydecker?
I told you I'd play ball with ya.

400
00:32:51,825 --> 00:32:54,066
(Lydecker hangs up)

401
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,654
Mr... Mr Lydecker?

402
00:32:55,745 --> 00:32:59,789
Give me the TAC team. Langford prison. Now.

403
00:33:08,173 --> 00:33:10,664
I made you some tea.

404
00:33:24,688 --> 00:33:27,392
Maria, I'm gonna get you outta here.

405
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,522
It's not that bad. Really.

406
00:33:31,736 --> 00:33:35,650
If he hadn't taken me in,
it would've been worse for me.

407
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,071
She has a bar code on
the back of her neck.

408
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,080
Can you give me a
name at least, huh?

409
00:33:46,165 --> 00:33:48,205
No.

410
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,791
Any files with identifying
marks or tattoos?

411
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:54,370
No.
In the hall. Now.

412
00:33:56,591 --> 00:33:59,082
Hey, you can't go in there!

413
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:02,971
Yeah. Get me the Warden.

414
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:13,429
I hooked your friend up, put her
on a work detail in the Warden's house.

415
00:34:13,523 --> 00:34:17,984
Well, I see a pair of six-inch,
black patent leather pumps in your future.

416
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:21,105
Yo, get the door open! Open it now!
Come on!

417
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:26,196
Everybody, clear the hall!
Up against the wall! You! Get out!

418
00:34:30,163 --> 00:34:32,072
Check for bar codes.

419
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:36,875
Yesterday they brought a girl in here.
Do you know where she is?

420
00:34:36,961 --> 00:34:41,338
No. We should probably start
with the downstairs bathroom.

421
00:34:41,423 --> 00:34:43,914
Don't make me ask you again.

422
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:48,801
His name is Lydecker, OK? He works for
some government agency I've never heard of.

423
00:34:48,888 --> 00:34:51,379
Did he say what he wanted with the girl?
No, sir.

424
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:54,925
Just that she has some kind
of bar code on the back of her neck.

425
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,399
Did you check solitary?

426
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:05,943
Nothin'. One of the guards says there's
a work detail in the Warden's quarters.

427
00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:07,902
Let's go.

428
00:35:09,449 --> 00:35:11,737
Get up! You're goin' back.

429
00:35:12,785 --> 00:35:15,951
I don't know these people,
or why they're looking for you,

430
00:35:16,038 --> 00:35:19,952
but if you tell them anything
about what happened here...

431
00:35:36,723 --> 00:35:39,475
Who's looking for me?
Lydecker.

432
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:46,772
Max, that's enough!

433
00:35:46,857 --> 00:35:50,392
Max! Damn, girl, what's in those pills?

434
00:35:50,903 --> 00:35:52,397
Spinach.

435
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:04,154
You're gonna help us get outta here.

436
00:36:04,248 --> 00:36:06,454
I don't think so.

437
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:09,329
Think again.

438
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,540
Come on.
Not without her.

439
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:15,920
Let's go.

440
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,684
Open it.

441
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:36,227
In the trunk, honey.
Don't think I don't know how to use this.

442
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:40,731
Anybody look twice, you're the Queen of the
Rose Parade. Just smile and wave. Get in.

443
00:36:42,115 --> 00:36:44,487
What do you mean, he left in his car?

444
00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:48,073
Check it out. Something
doesn't sound right.

445
00:36:51,832 --> 00:36:55,248
Pull over and let my girls out.
Whatever you say.

446
00:37:12,101 --> 00:37:14,058
I broke your lock. Sorry.

447
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:36,074
Come on, Cindy. Hurry.

448
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:41,287
(Cindy) Max, come on!

449
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,253
(Maria) He's got the gun!

450
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,693
I want the records of every female prisoner
booked in the last two days.

451
00:38:15,783 --> 00:38:16,814
Yes, sir.

452
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:22,860
47 entries.
Pull up the mugshots

453
00:38:22,956 --> 00:38:25,114
of all the ones under 25.

454
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:27,282
All right.

455
00:38:31,214 --> 00:38:34,333
There's a problem.
What the hell did you do?

456
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:37,959
The whole damn file's gone.
I didn't do anything.

457
00:38:38,053 --> 00:38:40,923
Vogelsang just bought himself
another manicure.

458
00:38:45,143 --> 00:38:48,891
Like it never existed.
I'd say my work is through here.

459
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,438
(phone)

460
00:38:51,857 --> 00:38:53,896
Hello?

461
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:56,819
Max. You all right?

462
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:01,231
Thank God.

463
00:39:07,288 --> 00:39:09,825
Ow! Careful.
Hold still.

464
00:39:10,874 --> 00:39:14,207
Bottom line, that SOB got what he deserved.

465
00:39:14,294 --> 00:39:16,785
He went splat.

466
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:21,372
Maria's totally crashed out.
Kid's been through a lot today.

467
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,376
Try the last few years.

468
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:26,588
Let her sleep while I go to Logan's
to find her a place to live.

469
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,195
Sounds like you all
are lucky to be alive.

470
00:39:29,207 --> 00:39:30,049
Mm.

471
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:34,269
Original Cindy looked into the jaws
of death and saw her own face.

472
00:39:34,354 --> 00:39:36,726
Listen to the mama of drama over here!

473
00:39:39,025 --> 00:39:42,025
You took a hell of a chance
coming in after me, though.

474
00:39:42,111 --> 00:39:47,068
You'd do the same for me. Besides,
we're the ones who put you in there.

475
00:39:47,157 --> 00:39:50,857
So, Max, Original Cindy and I
have been talking it over.

476
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:55,576
Mm-hm. Trouble follows you around
like the tail on a dog.

477
00:39:55,665 --> 00:39:59,080
There's something going on
that you don't want us to know about.

478
00:39:59,168 --> 00:40:03,829
Cos maybe you think we can't handle it?
But we can, cos we down like that.

479
00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:06,839
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

480
00:40:08,301 --> 00:40:12,630
This mysterious condition of yours?
Those guys looking for you at the jail?

481
00:40:12,722 --> 00:40:15,129
What guys?
I'm asking you.

482
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:24,058
All right. You guys really
wanna know what's up with me?

483
00:40:24,482 --> 00:40:26,771
Please.

484
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,729
What if I told you I was
a genetically revved-up female?

485
00:40:38,078 --> 00:40:39,738
Like we're not.

486
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:43,957
But... I'm a different
kind of female altogether.

487
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,585
Like you so special.

488
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,911
OK, fine, don't tell us.

489
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:54,418
But whatever's goin' on, just know.

490
00:40:54,759 --> 00:40:56,551
You still my boo.

491
00:40:57,637 --> 00:41:00,673
Yeah... Me and sister girl got your back.

492
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:04,967
You guys... Oh, my God!

493
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:09,769
I completely forgot about Walter's money.
No worries. It's been handled.

494
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,689
Go, go, go, go!

495
00:41:15,737 --> 00:41:18,227
Aw, hit him, you moron! Yes!

496
00:41:19,532 --> 00:41:21,275
Oh, not this clown again.

497
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:26,408
This is a Streaming Freedom Video bulletin.
It cannot be traced, it cannot be stopped,

498
00:41:26,496 --> 00:41:28,785
it is the only free voice
left in this city,

499
00:41:28,873 --> 00:41:32,538
and it's coming straight to you,
Officer Walter Eastep.

500
00:41:32,627 --> 00:41:34,833
That's right. You, Walter.

501
00:41:34,921 --> 00:41:38,206
Recognise yourself, extorting money
from some squatters?

502
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:39,841
...gonna cost you an extra $150.

503
00:41:39,925 --> 00:41:42,131
Dirty as the police department is,

504
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:46,679
I don't think your bosses are gonna
wanna see that tape broadcast 24/7.

505
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:49,255
It's not like they care you took a bribe,

506
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,019
just that you were dumb enough
to get caught on video,

507
00:41:52,103 --> 00:41:55,352
which kinda spoils the party
for everybody else.

508
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:58,144
So, here's how it's gonna be, Walter.

509
00:41:58,233 --> 00:42:02,859
You quit shaking down those squatters, and
this little video stays between you and me.

510
00:42:02,946 --> 00:42:07,738
This has been a Streaming Freedom Video
from the Eyes Only informant net.

511
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:12,367
How do you put this stuff together, Logan?

512
00:42:12,454 --> 00:42:15,953
The father runs a dairy farm,
the mom's a local schoolteacher.

513
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:19,492
They've always wanted kids.
And to top it off, she gets her own room.

514
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,137
And a pony.

515
00:42:21,149 --> 00:42:24,085
Forget Maria. I'm living
with these people(!)

516
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:27,376
They're dear friends of mine,
and they're excited about it.

517
00:42:27,468 --> 00:42:31,216
It's gonna work out great.
I'll get her over there in the morning.

518
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:35,966
Thanks for settin' this up.
That was a pretty bad scene she was in.

519
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:39,890
You were the one who cared enough
about this girl to go in and get her out.

520
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:42,933
You did a good thing, Max.
Better late than never.

521
00:42:43,024 --> 00:42:46,855
I knew that beneath that bio-engineered,
military-issue armor plating

522
00:42:46,944 --> 00:42:50,110
There was a beating heart.
Let's not go overboard here.

523
00:42:50,197 --> 00:42:52,272
I'm not joining the Logan Cale Brigade

524
00:42:52,365 --> 00:42:55,900
for the Defence of Widows,
Small Children and Lost Animals.

525
00:42:55,994 --> 00:42:59,611
You could be field commander.
I think not. So what's for dinner?

526
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:02,872
Are you gonna feed me, or just sit there?
You know,

527
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:05,710
you were much sweeter
when you weren't feeling well.

528
00:43:05,794 --> 00:43:08,878
The bitch is back.
