The Sokovia Accords.

Approved by 117 countries...

331
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,243
it states that the Avengers

332

shall no longer be a private organisation.

333
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,204
Instead...

334
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:36,584
they'll operate under the supervision
of a United Nations panel...

335
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,090
only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.

336

The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.

Tell me, Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?

If I misplaced a couple of
30 megaton nukes...

Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.

Believe me, this is the middle ground.

343

So, there are contingencies.

344

Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...

Our very strength invites challenge.

408
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,928
Challenge incites conflict.

He decided to spend his summer building

a building on him while we were kicking ass.

What if there is somewhere we need
to go and they don't let us?

TONY: Hey, you wanna see something cool?

815
00:57:56,391 --> 00:57:58,561
I pulled something from Dad's archives.

816
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:01,399
Felt timely.

817
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,990
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.

818
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:12,574
Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.

819
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,740
Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.

820
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,872
See? If not for these,
you wouldn't be here.

821
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:22,998
I'm trying to... What do you call it?

822
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:25,253
That's an olive branch.

823
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:27,587
Is that what you call it?

824
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:31,467
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.

825
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:35,009
We're kinda...

826
00:58:35,597 --> 00:58:37,267
- Well, not kinda...
- Pregnant?

827
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:39,234
No. Definitely not.

828
00:58:39,392 --> 00:58:41,192
We're taking a break.

829
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:42,562
It's nobody's fault.

830
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:45,607
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.

831
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,359
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.

832
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:52,356
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...

833
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,870
and then Ultron. My fault.

834
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:58,243
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.

835
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:00,791
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.

836
00:59:02,165 --> 00:59:04,205
I don't wanna lose her.

837
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:06,995
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.

838
00:59:10,632 --> 00:59:12,802
In her defence, I'm a handful.

839
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:18,354
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,
but he and Mom always made it work.

840
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:19,974
STEVE: I'm glad Howard got married.

841
00:59:20,683 --> 00:59:22,643
I only knew him
when he was young and single.

842
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,730
Oh, really? You two knew each other?

843
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:26,192
He never mentioned that.

844
00:59:26,356 --> 00:59:28,976
Maybe only a thousand times.

845
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:30,989
God, I hated you.

846
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:34,607
I don't mean to make things difficult.

847
00:59:34,781 --> 00:59:37,081
I know, because you're
a very polite person.

848
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,990
If I see a situation pointed south...

849
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,328
I can't ignore it.

850
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:43,793
Sometimes I wish I could.

851
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:44,997
No, you don't.

852
00:59:48,127 --> 00:59:49,627
No, I don't.

853
00:59:50,338 --> 00:59:51,338
Sometimes...

854
00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:54,546
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.

855
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,594
But I don't wanna see you gone.

856
00:59:57,345 --> 00:59:58,845
We need you, Cap.

857
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:03,015
So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.

858

859
01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:07,688
Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-centre...

860
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,815
instead of a Wakandan prison.

861
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:23,001
I'm not saying it's impossible...

862
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:25,214
but there would have to be safeguards.

863
01:00:25,373 --> 01:00:26,423
Sure.

864
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:30,376
Once we put out the PR fire,
those documents can be amended.

865
01:00:30,545 --> 01:00:32,255
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...

866
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:34,303
Wanda? What about Wanda?

867
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,130
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.

868
01:00:36,301 --> 01:00:37,511
Vision's keeping her company.

869
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:38,637
Oh, God, Tony.

870
01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:41,175
Every time I think you see
things the right way...

871
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:42,347
It's 100 acres with a lap pool.

872
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:43,472
It's got a screening room.

873
01:00:43,558 --> 01:00:44,728
There's worse ways to protect people.

874
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:45,849
Protection?

875
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:47,651
Is that how you see this?

876
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,769
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.

877
01:00:49,939 --> 01:00:51,269
- She's not a US citizen.
- Oh, come on, Tony.

878
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:52,857
And they don't grant visas
to weapons of mass destruction.

879
01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:53,942
She's a kid!

01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:08,122
Exactly.

1138
01:19:08,537 --> 01:19:09,827
Oh, what have we here?

1139
01:19:11,206 --> 01:19:12,916
- Uh...
- (CLATTERS)

1140
01:19:14,126 --> 01:19:15,336
(EXHALES)

1141
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:20,804
You're the Spider-ling.

1142
01:19:20,966 --> 01:19:22,836
Crime-fighting spider. You're Spider-Boy?

1143
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,259
Spider-Man.

1144
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:29,469
Not in that onesie, you're not.

1145
01:19:30,016 --> 01:19:31,936
It's not a onesie.

1146
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:36,519
I don't believe this. I was actually
having a really good day today, Mr Stark.

1147
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:39,860
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...

1148
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:43,105
and Algebra test, nailed it.

1149
01:19:43,905 --> 01:19:45,365
Who else knows? Anybody?

1150
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,080
Nobody.

1151
01:19:48,452 --> 01:19:50,452
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?

1152
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,910
No. No.

1153
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,670
No! If she knew, she would freak out.

1154
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,543
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

1155
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:58,745
You know what I think is really cool?
This webbing.

1156
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,510
That tensile strength is off the charts.

1157
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:03,971
Who manufactured that?

1158
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:05,469
I did.

1159
01:20:06,553 --> 01:20:08,143
Climbing walls, how you doing that?

1160
01:20:08,305 --> 01:20:09,555
Adhesive gloves?

1161
01:20:09,723 --> 01:20:11,023
It's a long story. I was...

1162
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:13,851
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

1163
01:20:14,019 --> 01:20:15,019
Yes, I can.

1164
01:20:15,187 --> 01:20:16,347
I'm blind!

1165
01:20:17,314 --> 01:20:18,904
I can see in those.

1166
01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:19,895
Okay?

1167
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:22,396
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...

1168
01:20:22,486 --> 01:20:24,776
it's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.

1169
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:29,622
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.

1170
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:32,200
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

1171
01:20:32,287 --> 01:20:34,657
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.

1172
01:20:34,748 --> 01:20:35,868
That's why I'm here.

1173
01:20:38,793 --> 01:20:39,923
Why you doing this?

1174
01:20:41,338 --> 01:20:42,508
I gotta know, what's your MO?

1175
01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:43,919
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?

1176
01:20:45,133 --> 01:20:46,343
Because...

1177
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:48,757
(STAMMERS)

1178
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:54,102
Because I've been me my whole life,
and I've had these powers for six months.

1179
01:20:54,559 --> 01:20:55,729
Mmm-hmm.

1180
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:58,190
I read books, I build computers.

1181
01:20:59,397 --> 01:21:03,690
Yeah, I would love to play football,
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.

1182
01:21:03,944 --> 01:21:05,454
Sure, because you're different.

1183
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:08,532
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.

1184
01:21:12,244 --> 01:21:16,544
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

1185
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:21,089
and then the bad things happen...

1186
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:23,456
they happen because of you.

1187
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:30,724
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?

1188
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:33,097
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?

1189
01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:35,888
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.

1190
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:38,483
That's what it is.

1191
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:47,895
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.

1192
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:52,871
(TONY EXHALES)

1193
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:58,040
You got a passport?

1194
01:21:58,123 --> 01:21:59,503
No, I don't even have a driver's licence.

1195
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:01,126
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.

1196
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:02,209
Oh, you'll love it.

1197
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:04,339
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?

1198
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:08,008
I got homework.

1199
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:10,585
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

1200
01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:12,724
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.

1201
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:14,009
Might be a little dangerous.

1202
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:15,927
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.

1203
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,650
Don't tell Aunt May.

1204
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:22,559
All right, Spider-Man.

1205
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:27,402
Get me out of this.

1206
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:28,609
Sorry. I'll get the...

1207

(EXPLOSION)

1208
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:42,791
What is it?

1209
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:44,379
Stay here, please.

1210
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:48,797
(GASPS)

1211
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:52,509
Guess I shoulda knocked.

1212
01:22:52,844 --> 01:22:56,104
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

1213
01:22:56,264 --> 01:22:58,564
Disappointing my kids.

1214
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,863
I'm supposed to go waterskiing.

1215
01:23:04,356 --> 01:23:06,146
Cap needs our help. Come on.

1216
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:07,483
Clint!

1217
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:10,702
You should not be here.

1218
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:14,281
Really?

1219
01:23:14,783 --> 01:23:17,873
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.

1220
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:20,329
Please consider
the consequences of your actions.

1221
01:23:20,497 --> 01:23:21,407
Okay, they're considered.

1222
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:22,711
(GROANS)

1223
01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:24,384
Okay, we gotta go.

1224
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:30,045
It's this way.

1225
01:23:30,507 --> 01:23:32,427
I've caused enough problems.

1226
01:23:33,051 --> 01:23:34,051
(SIGHS)

1227
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:38,471
You gotta help me, Wanda.

1228
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,350
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

1229
01:23:40,517 --> 01:23:42,557
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

1230
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:44,191
Shit.

1231
01:23:48,525 --> 01:23:49,775
(GROANS)

1232
01:23:51,152 --> 01:23:52,902
I knew I should've stretched.

1233
01:23:53,363 --> 01:23:54,823
(BOTH GRUNTING)

1234
01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:09,001
VISION: Clint, you can't overpower me.

1235
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,010
I know I can't.

1236
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:13,169
But she can.

1237
01:24:14,718 --> 01:24:17,798
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.

1238
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:19,722
I'm leaving.

1239
01:24:19,848 --> 01:24:20,968
I can't let you.

1240
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,360
I'm sorry.

1241
01:24:30,859 --> 01:24:32,689
If you do this...

1242
01:24:33,153 --> 01:24:36,163
they will never stop being afraid of you.

1243
01:24:37,615 --> 01:24:40,945
I can't control their fear, only my own.

1244
01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:54,423
CLINT: Oh...

1245
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,802
Come on. We got one more stop.

1246
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:01,347
ATTACHE: It's just a matter of time.

1247
01:25:01,431 --> 01:25:04,181
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,

1248
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:05,887
and behavioural pattern scans.

1249
01:25:10,064 --> 01:25:12,614
Move or you will be moved.

1250
01:25:13,902 --> 01:25:16,572
As entertaining as that would be...

1251
01:25:16,738 --> 01:25:18,908
You really think you can find him?

1252
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:21,077
My resources are considerable.

1253
01:25:21,242 --> 01:25:23,622
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...

1254
01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:26,213
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.

1255
01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:29,075
You know where they are.

1256
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,340
I know someone who does.

1257
01:25:34,088 --> 01:25:36,628
Not sure you understand
the concept of a getaway car.

1258
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:37,716
It's low profile.

1259
01:25:38,343 --> 01:25:41,103
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.

1260
01:25:42,931 --> 01:25:44,431
Can you move your seat up?

1261
01:25:44,599 --> 01:25:45,729
No.

1262
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:47,015
I owe you again.

1263
01:25:47,644 --> 01:25:49,234
Keeping a list.

1264
01:25:52,357 --> 01:25:54,107
You know, he kinda tried to kill me.

1265
01:25:55,026 --> 01:25:57,736
Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.

1266
01:26:01,074 --> 01:26:03,284
They're going to come looking for you.

1267
01:26:03,368 --> 01:26:04,238
I know.

1268
01:26:07,163 --> 01:26:08,543
Thank you, Sharon.

1269
01:26:24,097 --> 01:26:25,097
That was...

1270
01:26:25,265 --> 01:26:26,175
Late.

1271
01:26:26,266 --> 01:26:27,096
Damn right.

1272
01:26:31,771 --> 01:26:32,771
I should go.

1273
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:33,939
Okay.

You know I wouldn't have called
if I had any other choice.

1276
01:27:02,135 --> 01:27:03,505
Hey, man, you're doing me a favour.

1277
01:27:03,678 --> 01:27:06,008
Besides, I owe a debt.

1278
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:07,720
Thanks for having my back.

1279
01:27:07,891 --> 01:27:09,391
It was time to get off my ass.

1280
01:27:09,976 --> 01:27:11,596
How about our other recruit?

1281
01:27:11,769 --> 01:27:13,349
He's rarin' to go.

1282
01:27:14,147 --> 01:27:15,357
Had to put a little coffee in him...

1284
01:27:16,691 --> 01:27:17,821
but he should be good.

1285
01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:22,695
What time zone is this?

1286
01:27:22,864 --> 01:27:24,704
Come on. Come on.

01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:29,747
- Captain America!
- Mr Lang.

1288
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:31,830
It's an honour.

1289
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:34,083
I'm shaking your hand too long.

1290
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,500
Wow! This is awesome!

1291
01:27:35,710 --> 01:27:38,300
Captain America.
I know you, too. You're great!

1292
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:43,050
Jeez.

1293
01:27:43,217 --> 01:27:47,184
Ah, look, I wanna say, I know
you know a lot of super people, so...

1294
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:49,969
thinks for thanking of me.

1295
01:27:50,224 --> 01:27:51,944
- Hey, man!
- What's up, Tic Tac?

1296
01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:53,185
Uh, good to see you.

1297
01:27:53,269 --> 01:27:54,729
