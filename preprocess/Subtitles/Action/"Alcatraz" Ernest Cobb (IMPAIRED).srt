<i>your sister.</i>

- Go to hell.
- She wanted to know you.

649
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:03,236
She wanted
a big brother.

650
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,990
Go to hell!

651
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:08,324
Okay, Cobb,

00:38:10,794 --> 00:38:12,579
I'm coming out.

00:38:14,665 --> 00:38:15,999
Here's the gun.

655
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:18,968
All right?

656
00:38:19,036 --> 00:38:20,837
My hands are
in the air.

657
00:38:22,723 --> 00:38:25,374
I have the letter.
I can show you.

658
00:38:25,426 --> 00:38:27,210
<i>She's not out there.</i>

659
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:28,428
Your sister's
not out there.

660
00:38:28,512 --> 00:38:29,729
- Shut...
- Cobb!

[Grunting]

662
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:33,483
Don't move!

663
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,652
-Don't move!
- Oh.

664
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,020
Is he right-handed?

665
00:38:37,071 --> 00:38:38,571
Yeah.

[Heart monitor beeping]

669
00:39:17,027 --> 00:39:18,478
I don't think
I can hack this.

670
00:39:18,545 --> 00:39:20,730
- Doc...
- No, I mean it.

671
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:21,981
I mean, Hauser
doesn't need me,

672
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:24,400
and what we're doing,

673
00:39:24,451 --> 00:39:26,936
stone-cold killers
and dead bodies,

674
00:39:26,987 --> 00:39:30,773
and someone I actually
know getting...

675
00:39:30,824 --> 00:39:33,442
Right in front of me.

676
00:39:33,494 --> 00:39:35,878
This isn't a comic book
world, is it?

677
00:39:35,946 --> 00:39:36,963
I mean, real people
are gonna die

678
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:38,381
if we don't
catch these guys.

679
00:39:38,448 --> 00:39:41,019
It's okay
to feel this way, doc.

680
00:39:42,786 --> 00:39:44,504
It comes
with the job.

681
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,676
I'm afraid...

682
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,345
I'm not gonna be
good at it.

683
00:39:54,598 --> 00:39:57,317
Well, too late.
You already are.

684
00:39:58,569 --> 00:40:02,522
I want to you go home,
get some sleep,

685
00:40:02,606 --> 00:40:03,856
and get ready
for the next one,

686
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:07,143
because I need you.

687
00:40:10,748 --> 00:40:12,615
Thanks.

688
00:41:13,644 --> 00:41:15,378
Close it up.

689
00:41:22,986 --> 00:41:26,055
I could have
killed you today.

690
00:41:26,106 --> 00:41:28,908
But now you're here,

691
00:41:28,992 --> 00:41:32,445
you're gonna wish I had.

692

But not to worry, son.

699

I've studied
and researched

700
00:41:55,853 --> 00:41:58,187
and found a doctor who,
with God's will,

might could be able
to help you.
