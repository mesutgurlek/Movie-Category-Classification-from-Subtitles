00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:22,850
<i>- Still holding the murder weapon.</i>
- What's wrong?

606
00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:26,827
<i>- Tazio's wallet in his pocket.</i>
- McKensie's telling the truth.

607
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,955
Yeah, that happens
sometimes in court.

608
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:33,263
No, no, no, no.
Somebody has to be lying.

609
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:39,600
- What's he doing here?
- Who?

610
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:45,913
<i>It's Ben Urich,</i>
<i>the reporter from the</i> Post.

611
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:58,616
[ Snorts ]
So does this mean you want a rematch?

612
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:00,696
I told you
I'd find you.

613
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:06,669
- How did you know I wasn't a mugger?
- [ Chuckles ]

614
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:12,371
Muggers don't usually wear
rose oil or high heels...

615
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:14,500
at least this far
from Chelsea.

616
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,771
<i>Come here.</i>

617
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:23,284
- There's something I wanna show you.
<i>- Wait a second.</i>

618
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:25,911
Exactly how many women
have you brought up here?

619
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:30,083
[ Chuckling ]
Uh... you're my first.

620
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:33,162
- Good answer.
- I thought that was the right answer.

621
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:41,131
<i>[ Elektra ]</i>
<i>Look at this. It's so beautiful.</i>

622
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:44,604
I know. This was my favorite
view of the city when I was a kid.

623
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:47,175
<i>I really wanted you</i>
<i>to see this.</i>
