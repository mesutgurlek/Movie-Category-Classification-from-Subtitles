[Narrator]
1879. The Civil War is over,

2
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,250
and the resulting economic explosion
spurs the great migration west.

3
00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:48,263
Farmers, ranchers, prospectors,
killers and thieves...

4
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:50,492
seek their fortunes.

5
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:53,297
Cattle drovers turn cow towns
into armed camps...

6
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:58,864
with murder rates higher than those
of modern-day New York or Los Angeles.

7
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:02,378
Out of this chaos comes
legendary lawman Wyatt Earp,

8
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:06,347
retiring his badge and gun to start
a peaceful life with his family.

9
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,941
Earp's friend
John "Doc" Holliday...

10
00:01:09,018 --> 00:01:11,782
a Southern gentleman
turned gunman and gambler...

11
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:17,054
also travels west, hoping the dry
climate will relieve his tuberculosis.

12
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:19,391
Silver is discovered
in Arizona.

13
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:22,295
Tombstone becomes
queen of the boomtowns,

14
00:01:22,365 --> 00:01:26,426
where the latest Paris fashions are sold
from the backs of wagons.

15
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,131
Attracted to this
atmosphere of greed,

16
00:01:29,205 --> 00:01:31,867
over 100 exiled Texas outlaws
band together...

17
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:36,674
to form the ruthless gang recognized
by the red sashes they wear.

18
00:01:36,746 --> 00:01:41,410
They emerge as the earliest example
of organized crime in America.

19
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:45,011
They call themselves
"The Cowboys"

Never saw a rich man...

who didn't wind up
with a guilty conscience.

I already got a guilty conscience.
Might as well have the money too.

156
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:12,452
are we cross?

157
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,125
Them guns don't scare me.

158
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:20,501
'Cause without them guns
you ain't nothin' but a skinny lunger.

159
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:23,973
Ed, what an ugly thing to say.

160
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:28,945
- I abhor ugliness. Does this
mean we're not friends anymore?
- [Spits]

161
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,643
You know, Ed, if I thought
you weren't my friend,

162
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:35,811
I just don't think
I could bear it.

163
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:40,550
[Cocks Hammer]

164
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,355
[Clicking]

165
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:56,304
There. Now we can
be friends again.

166
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,870
[Bailey Shouting]

167
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,977
[Grunts]

168
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,920
- Touch that gun,
I'll burn you down.
- [Bailey Shouts]

169
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,819
[Horse Neighing]

170
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:22,833
I calculate that's
the end of this town.

171
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:27,395
I had a boy at the hotel pack us up.
The horse is outside.

172
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:30,600
So that's why you're
not wearin' a bustle.

173
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:33,337
[Horse Neighing]

174
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:36,710
My sweet, soft
Hungarian devil.

175
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,288
Well!

176
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:50,685
Good evenin', then.

177
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,301
Let's not bother
about the luggage.

178
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,373
[Laughing]

179
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:45,773
[Man] Hyah!

180
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:16,346
[Horse Neighing]

181
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:23,515
Hey, Morg,
pretty big, isn't it?

182
00:15:26,724 --> 00:15:31,889
Oh-ho, brother, you can smell
the silver in this town.

183
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:34,955
- Easy.
- Look at these girls over here.

184
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:38,127
- Hi!
- [Virgil] Hello, girls!

185
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,637
Hot damn, this burg's jumpin'!

186
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:43,196
Here we go, ladies.

187
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:47,472
- Isn't that sweet?
- You can say that.

188
00:15:53,985 --> 00:15:57,648
- [Chattering]
- Sheriff.

189
00:16:06,297 --> 00:16:08,663
Newcomers, eh?

190
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:12,066
The name's John Behan,
Cochise County Sheriff.

191
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:14,400
- Just in town?
- Just this minute.

192
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:18,841
- I'm Wyatt Earp, and these are
my brothers, Virgil and Morgan.
- Wyatt Earp. Dodge City.

193
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,073
[Wyatt] Gave all that up, Sheriff.
Goin' into business.

194
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:26,480
- Don't even carry a gun anymore.
- Going into business, huh?

195
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:29,247
Well then, I'm the man to see.

196
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,788
Besides sheriff,
I'm also tax collector,

197
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:35,257
Captain of the Fire Brigade and Chairman
of the Nonpartisan Anti-Chinese League.

198
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:37,726
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?

199
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,798
Yeah, a man of many parts.

200
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:45,302
- Say, you folks got
a place to stay yet?
- No.

201
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,033
- Like I said, we just got here.
- Well, I also sit on
the town lot commission.

202
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:51,405
Really?

203
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:56,379
As a matter of fact, we got three
lovely cottages coming up for rent.

204
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:59,473
I'll throw in a good cleaning,
no charge.

205
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,644
Believe me, Mr. Earp,

206
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:04,984
you're not gonna find a better deal
within town limits.

207
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:07,490
I don't know,
sounds pretty good.

208
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,427
- Well, I'll have my man show 'em to ya.
- Thank you.

209
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:21,238
Hey, Wyatt,
get on over here.

210
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,139
I want you to meet Fred White.
He's the town marshall.

211
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,403
- My pleasure.
- Lotta law around here.

212
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:29,469
- I already met the county sheriff.
- Who, Behan?

213
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:33,381
He ain't no law. The only real law
around here is the Cowboys.

214
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:37,615
Cowboys? I had a run-in
with a couple of them up in Prescott.

215
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,783
Nobody does nothin' without 'em.
I mean, they're it.

216
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:43,418
There are three of 'em
right over there.

217
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:47,863
You can always spot a Cowboy.
They always wear those red sashes.

218
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:51,800
- The main fact is the Cowboys
are good for business.
- 'Bout all these saloons?

219
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:54,929
Oh, that's the real mother lode
here in Tombstone.

220
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:57,440
All up and down
Allen Street here.

221
00:17:57,508 --> 00:18:00,306
Twenty-four hours a day,
you got liquor, hostesses, gamblin';

222
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,778
makin' money
hand-over-fist.

223
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:07,147
All except 'the Oriental.'
That's a regular slaughterhouse.

224
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:10,153
Even the high rollers
won't go near it.

225
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:14,214
That's too bad too.
It's a nice place.

226
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:17,159
Hell of a waste.

227
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:20,061
- # [Piano]
- [Virgil] Wyatt?

228
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:22,361
- There he goes.
- Yeah.

229
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:27,730
OI' Wyatt.

230
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,211
[Card Dealer] All right, fella,
I'll brace ya now for a little lesson.

231
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,806
Put your money on the board.
Five dollars on that six of spades.

232
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,443
Like that.

233
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,888
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Get that cigar outta my face.

234
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:47,584
Howdy, stranger.
What can I get ya?

235
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,820
I wouldn't mind
one of those cigars.

236
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,557
[Dealer] I'm about ready to go home.
I wish y'all would stop yakkin'...

237
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,758
- and just play cards.
- Thank you.

238
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,768
Kinda nice in here.
You run it?

239
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,031
Milt Joyce: Owner, operator.

240
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,541
- Wyatt Earp.
- [Chuckling] Yeah, sure.

241
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:06,338
[Dealer] I said lay off the queen,
you jackass!

242
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,278
I swear I'm gonna
slap somebody now.

243
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:14,512
Excuse me for askin', Milt,
but... kinda dead in here, isn't it?

244
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,453
- You don't listen too good, do ya?
- See that bird at the faro table?

245
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:20,685
You back that queen again,
you son-of-a-bitch,

246
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,853
I'll blow you right up
that wildcat's ass!
Do you hear me, huh?

247
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,831
He comes bargin' in here one day,
slappin' the customers,
wavin' his gun around.

248
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,333
He chased out all
the high-class play.

249
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:34,395
The only trade that comes in
here now is the bummers and
the drovers; just the dregs.

250
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:38,067
Why don't you get rid of him,
get yourself a straight dealer?

251
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,441
Sure, stranger,
that's easy for you to say.

252
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,413
Shit!

253
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,482
Goddammit, Junior, how many times
am I going to tell you...

254
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:52,649
to keep that damn cigar
outta my face? Huh?

255
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:56,683
Christ almighty, it's like I'm
sittin' here playing cards with
my brother's kids or somethin',

256
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:59,093
you nerve-wracking
sons-of-bitches.

257
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,624
Is somethin' on your mind?

258
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,637
Just want to let you know
you're sittin' in my chair.

259
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,105
Is that a fact?

260
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,608
Yeah, it's a fact.

261
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:15,635
For a man that don't go heeled, you run
your mouth kinda reckless, don't ya?

262
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,650
No need to go heeled to get
the bulge on a tub like you.

263
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,585
- Is that a fact?
- Mm-hmm.

264
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,418
That's a fact.

265
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,984
Well, I'm real scared.

266
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:34,930
Damn right, you're scared.
I can see that in your eyes.

267
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,491
- All right now!
- Go ahead.

268
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,665
Go ahead, skin it! Skin that
smoke wagon and see what happens.

269
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:47,007
Listen, mister,
I-I'm gettin' awful tired of your...

270
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:50,343
I'm gettin' tired of your gas.
Now jerk that pistol and go to work.

271
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:57,120
- [Grunts]
- I said throw down, boy.

272
00:20:57,188 --> 00:20:59,816
[Yells]

273
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:07,598
You gonna do somethin',
or just stand there and bleed?

274
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,833
No?

275
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:17,540
I didn't think so.

276
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,443
Here, Milt, a keepsake.

277
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:27,049
Hang it over the bar.
All right, youngster, out you go.

278
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,847
Don't come back!

279
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,357
Ever!

280
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:40,295
Well, what do you say, Milt?

281
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,857
Twenty-five percent
of the house take sound about right?

282
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,369
[Drover Whistling]
Hyah!

283
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:50,238
- [Chattering]
- [Cows Mooing]

284
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,243
Well, we're off and runnin'.

285
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:56,542
Just acquired us a quarter interest
in a game at 'the Oriental.'

286
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:58,809
- Acquired?
- So to speak.

287
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,281
Now all we gotta do is keep our
eyes on that brass ring, fellas.

288
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,053
[Morgan Chuckling]
You're the one, Wyatt.

289
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,459
Why, Johnny Tyler!

290
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:14,521
- You madcap!
- Doc?

291
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,966
Where you goin'
with that shotgun?

292
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,369
I didn't know you
was back in town.

293
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,403
Well, well.

294
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,640
How the hell are you?

295
00:22:28,713 --> 00:22:32,672
Wyatt, I am rolling.
Morgan.

296
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,515
- Doc.
- Virgil.

297
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:38,351
'Lo, Doc.

298
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,948
Wyatt Earp?

299
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:47,829
Going into business
for ourselves, Doc.

300
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:51,232
- Wyatt just got us a faro game.
- Oh.

301
00:22:51,302 --> 00:22:53,896
Since when is faro
a business?

302
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,373
- Didn't you always say that
gambling's an honest trade?
- No.

303
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:01,776
I said poker's an honest trade.
Only suckers buck the tiger's
odds all on the house.

304
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:06,044
Depends on how you look at it.
I mean, it's not like anybody's

456
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:32,869
- I told you, I'm burnin' up tonight.
- Loser on the ace.

457
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,879
I'll take the red seven,
and I got some deeds here.

458
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,542
- I'll take seven stinkin' diamonds.
- Awww-ful lot of money.

459
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,882
- You can't stand the heat, pal,
get out of the kitchen.
- You're the doctor.

460
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,286
Sad news, friend,
you lose.

461
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,087
- So, now we're in
the mining business.
- You're the one, Wyatt.

We're turnin' into
regular tycoons.

463
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:55,128
Think I'll call this one
the Mattie Blalock. Mattie'd
get a kick outta that one.

464
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,827
- That's her maiden name.
- And what a maiden.

465
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:00,837
- Pure as the driven snow, I'm sure.
- Hey, Doc, come on now.

466
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:04,363
It's just his style, Morg.
He doesn't mean anything.

467
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,070
Tell me something,
my friend. I'm curious.

468
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:11,547
Do you actually consider yourself
a married man, forsaking all others?

469
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,777
Yeah, pretty much.

470
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:17,719
I mean, I was no angel
when we met, but neither was she.

471
00:34:17,788 --> 00:34:22,248
People can change, Doc.
Sooner or later, you gotta grow up.

00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,692
I see.

[Clears Throat]
And what would you do,
if she walked in here?

474
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,059
- 'She'?
- You know damn well who I mean.

475
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,901
That dusky-hued
lady satan, that's who.

476
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,237
- Oh, I'd probably ignore her.
- Ignore her?

477
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:41,244
I'd ignore her.
People can change, Doc.

478
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,678
I'll remember
you said that.

should I hate him?

wasn't it?

- No, I'm not touchy. I'm just...

It's a silly question, is all.
'Am I happy? Are you happy? '
Are you happy?

Oh, I'm always happy,

and I'm telling you what
suits me is a family and kids.

Two years. Two days.
Hard to say, if you stop now:

Your smokin',
your drinkin',

your gamblin',
your night life.

899
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:18,702
You need complete rest.

900
01:06:20,108 --> 01:06:24,340
What I mean is,
you must attempt to, uh, deny...

- your, uh, marital impulse.
- Get out of my sight.

Yes, it's true,
you are a good woman.

01:07:45,794 --> 01:07:50,398
you may be the Antichrist.

Goddamn.

Now there's six of 'em.
Hell, this is like a bad dream.

917
01:08:18,392 --> 01:08:21,691
Just stay calm. Use your head.
It'll be all right.

Just the same, though...

Guess maybe you better
swear me in.

Those Cowboys been telling everybody
in town they're gonna clean you out.

They're back there in that lot
behind the O.K. Corral.

- Thank you, Mayor.
- What're you doin' out of bed, Doc?

923

What are we gonna do?
- Wait 'til the liquor wears off.

926
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:32,155
Soon as they start gettin' headaches,
they'll lose interest.

Lose interest, hell.
They're threatenin' our lives.

- You'll never make that stick.
- They're carryin' guns, Wyatt.

929
01:09:38,873 --> 01:09:40,807
Christ's sake, Virg,
that's a misdemeanor.

930
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:44,572
You go arrest them, something
goes wrong, maybe somebody
really gets his head broken.

comin' around lookin' for
trouble from here to Christmas.

over a misdemeanor?
- Damn right I'll risk it.

They're breakin' the law.

It's not your problem, Doc.
You don't have to mix up in this.

All right, Virg.

Your call.
Give Doc the shotgun.

- Goddamn sons-of-bitches!
- Morgan, wait a minute! Virg...

1064
01:24:55,755 --> 01:24:58,121
- You had to be so damned smart.
- I'm sorry, Allie.

1065
01:24:58,191 --> 01:25:00,455
I told you, Virg.

1066
01:25:00,527 --> 01:25:02,825
- Not now, Wyatt.
- All right.

1067
01:25:02,896 --> 01:25:05,057
- [Groaning]
- All right, what do you want me to do?

1068
01:25:05,131 --> 01:25:09,124
- Just leave me alone, for God's sakes.
- Virg...

1069
01:25:09,202 --> 01:25:12,171
He doesn't want
to talk now, Wyatt!

1070
01:25:28,254 --> 01:25:31,985
I heard about what they did
to your women. That was wrong.

1071
01:25:32,058 --> 01:25:36,256
I'm here to let you know that it
wasn't me. I had no part of it.

1072
01:25:36,329 --> 01:25:40,663
No? Brothers to the bone,
right, McMasters?

1073
01:25:40,733 --> 01:25:44,965
No. Not anymore.
Not after this night.

1074
01:25:45,038 --> 01:25:49,441
He's right, Wyatt. You want us
for anything, we're with you.

1075
01:25:49,509 --> 01:25:51,477
Come on.

1076

- [Dog Barking]

1079
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,775
Hold him!

1080
01:26:56,843 --> 01:27:00,779
- [Screaming]
- No! Get her out of here! Jesus!

1081
01:27:00,847 --> 01:27:05,079

- Somebody shut that dog up!

1082

[Groaning]

1083
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:10,414

- I said hold him, goddammit!

1084
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:13,118
- [Barking]
- Somebody get that
goddamn dog out of here!

1085
01:27:13,192 --> 01:27:16,650
The bullet's too deep.
I can't get it out.

1086
01:27:18,898 --> 01:27:21,526
- The way it's lodged
in there... I'm sorry.
- [Louisa Crying]

1087
01:27:21,601 --> 01:27:24,695
Easy, Morg.
Is that better?

1088
01:27:25,772 --> 01:27:27,706
Yeah.

1089
01:27:30,276 --> 01:27:34,474
You were right, Wyatt.
They got me good.

1090
01:27:36,316 --> 01:27:40,582
Don't let 'em get you, brother.
You're the one.

1091
01:27:41,654 --> 01:27:44,487
Easy, Morg.

1092
01:27:44,557 --> 01:27:47,617
Don't worry about that, now.

[Louisa Sobbing]

1094
01:27:51,497 --> 01:27:54,830
Remember what I said
about seein' a light when you're dyin'?

1095
01:27:54,901 --> 01:27:58,359
Yeah. Yeah.

1096
01:27:58,438 --> 01:28:00,599
That ain't true.

1097
01:28:00,673 --> 01:28:03,608
I can't see a damn thing.

1098
01:28:06,646 --> 01:28:08,580
Morg?

1099
01:28:12,952 --> 01:28:14,886
Morg!

Morgan, don't die!
I love you!

[Crying]
Why? Why him?

1107
01:29:08,007 --> 01:29:12,273
- No. No, get away from me!
- Wyatt!

1108
01:29:13,446 --> 01:29:16,540
Can't you see?
Get away from me!

1109
01:29:51,551 --> 01:29:54,349
Morgan!

And so she walked
out of our lives forever.

1113
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:08,726
Giddup!

1114
01:31:23,042 --> 01:31:26,534
Want you to know it's over.

1115
01:31:28,915 --> 01:31:31,008
Well.

1116
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:33,051
Bye.

1117
01:31:35,054 --> 01:31:37,716
You smell that, Bill?

1118
01:31:39,325 --> 01:31:41,486
Smells like someone died.

1119
01:31:43,062 --> 01:31:46,759
Jesus, Johnny.

Ike.

1123
01:32:11,991 --> 01:32:15,392
Take Stillwell and finish it.

1124
01:32:30,876 --> 01:32:34,334
Now, you take care of yourself...

1125
01:32:34,413 --> 01:32:38,076
- That's Virgil with the women.
- He's mine!

1126
01:32:38,150 --> 01:32:41,517
- All aboard!
- Hey, Mattie! Where's Wyatt?

1127
01:32:41,587 --> 01:32:44,215
Right behind you, Stillwell.

1128
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:46,451
- Aah!
- No!

1129

[Onlooker]
Sweet Jesus.

1130
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:23,485
All right, Clanton.

1131
01:33:23,562 --> 01:33:27,692
You called down the thunder.
Well, now you got it.

1132
01:33:29,668 --> 01:33:33,604
You see that? It says,
'United States Marshal.'

1133
01:33:33,672 --> 01:33:36,197
Wyatt.
Please don't kill me. Please.

1134
01:33:36,275 --> 01:33:40,575
Take a good look at him, Ike,
'cause that's how you're gonna end up.

1135
01:33:42,714 --> 01:33:45,274
The Cowboys are finished.
You understand me?

1136
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:48,877
I see a red sash,
I kill the man wearin' it.

1137
01:33:48,954 --> 01:33:50,979
So run, you cur.

Run! Tell all the other curs

You tell 'em I'm comin'!

And hell's comin'
with me, you hear?

1141
01:34:02,401 --> 01:34:05,199
Hell's comin' with me!

Got you in a little crossfire.
How do ya like that?

Come on! Think of

Yaahh!

01:37:37,816 --> 01:37:40,478
No. No!

1165
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:55,356
Did you ever see anything
like that before?

1166
01:37:55,434 --> 01:37:58,995
- Hell, I ain't never even
heard of anything like that.
- Nothin'.

1167
01:38:00,072 --> 01:38:02,006
Where is he?

1168
01:38:02,074 --> 01:38:05,510
[Coughing]
Down by the creek,

1169
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:07,908
walkin' on water.

1170
01:38:07,979 --> 01:38:11,244
Well, let's hope he's got
another miracle up his sleeve.

1171
01:38:11,316 --> 01:38:15,309
'Cause if I know Ringo,
he's headed straight for us.

1172
01:38:15,387 --> 01:38:19,721
Well, if they were my brothers,
I'd want revenge too.

1173
01:38:19,791 --> 01:38:22,521
No. Make no mistake.

1174
01:38:22,594 --> 01:38:25,893
It's not revenge he's after.

1175
01:38:27,766 --> 01:38:29,996
It's a reckoning.

1176
01:38:34,773 --> 01:38:37,469
[Coughing]

1177
01:38:40,212 --> 01:38:44,842
Doc. You ought to be in bed. What
the hell you doin' this for anyway?

1178
01:38:44,916 --> 01:38:47,407
Wyatt Earp is my friend.

01:38:47,486 --> 01:38:50,649
Hell, I got lots of friends.

1180
01:38:52,657 --> 01:38:54,750
I don't.

1181

- Are you all right?
- What do you care?

1184
01:39:21,353 --> 01:39:23,719
It was your friends
that did it.

1185
01:39:25,924 --> 01:39:29,587
Must've been Claiborne and Fuller.
They left here last night.

1186
01:39:29,661 --> 01:39:32,459
Aw, no.

1187
01:39:32,531 --> 01:39:35,364
They tried to take my watch.

1188
01:39:35,433 --> 01:39:39,335
He cursed them for cowards,
and they shot him.

1189
01:39:40,405 --> 01:39:44,205
I don't understand
any of this.

1190
01:39:44,276 --> 01:39:46,744
I just know it's ugly.

1191
01:39:46,811 --> 01:39:49,405
You're all ugly,

1192
01:39:49,481 --> 01:39:53,076
and he was beautiful.

1193
01:39:53,151 --> 01:39:57,451
He tried to bring something
fine into your ugly world,
and you shot him for it.

1194
01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:03,685
Not that you care.

1195
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:18,537
- Billy. Where you goin'?
- I'm not goin' with you.

01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:20,908
Billy!
Billy, get back here!

1197
01:40:20,979 --> 01:40:23,539
I'm sorry, sir,
but we got to have some law.

1198
01:40:23,615 --> 01:40:27,449
- Billy!
- [Ringo] Let him go. Who cares?

1199
01:40:27,519 --> 01:40:30,852
Yaahh! Get the hell
outta here! Go on!

1200

Party's over, boys.
Let's go!

1201
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,574
Whoa.

1202
01:40:56,079 --> 01:40:59,242
Ringo and Behan
are out front.

1203
01:40:59,316 --> 01:41:03,343
There is about 30 of 'em.

1204
01:41:04,487 --> 01:41:06,421
They're all wearin' badges.

1205

Christ.

1206
01:41:10,627 --> 01:41:14,757
We gotta find
a place to hole up.

1207
01:41:14,831 --> 01:41:16,958
Doc.

1208
01:41:17,033 --> 01:41:18,967
Grab him.

1209
01:41:21,237 --> 01:41:23,171
I got him.

1210
01:41:23,807 --> 01:41:25,741
I got him!

1211
01:41:31,348 --> 01:41:33,282
Is this Henry Hooker's ranch?

1212
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:36,012
That's right.
And I'm Hooker.

1213
01:41:36,086 --> 01:41:38,384
We got a sick man.

1214
01:41:38,455 --> 01:41:40,446
And our horses are done in.

1215
01:41:40,523 --> 01:41:42,889
Put him up at my place,

1216
01:41:42,959 --> 01:41:45,086
as long as it's just tonight.

1217
01:41:45,161 --> 01:41:47,129
We're in debt to ya.

1218
01:41:54,404 --> 01:41:59,899
I know you boys have got to keep movin',
but he looks pretty bad to me.

1219
01:42:03,246 --> 01:42:07,205
- Whoa!
- [Horses Whinny]

They got held up,
and their boss actor got killed.

1221

They came here to water the horses,
then they'll push on.

1222
01:42:51,694 --> 01:42:55,630
I'm sorry about your friend.
And I'm... I'm sorry that l...

1223
01:42:55,698 --> 01:42:58,929
I forgave you
the moment you said it.

1224
01:42:59,002 --> 01:43:01,732
You did? Well...

1225
01:43:02,972 --> 01:43:04,906
Thank you.

01:43:06,242 --> 01:43:08,301
All set.

I have to go.

They got McMasters!

Geez!

1234
01:44:30,827 --> 01:44:33,421
Ringo wanted to make sure
he got your attention, Marshal!

1235
01:44:33,496 --> 01:44:36,488
He wants a straight-up fight,
just you and him,

1236
01:44:36,566 --> 01:44:38,830
to settle this thing
once and for all.

of Silver Springs canyon, 7:00!

You tell him I'll be there!

- Are you crazy?
- I'll be there!

1240
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:51,770
It's not finished.

1241
01:45:06,729 --> 01:45:09,823
After I'm done
with Wyatt Earp,

take your Cowboys and finish off
Creek Johnson and Texas Jack.

You burn 'em, Ike.

1244
01:45:20,443 --> 01:45:25,107
- Burn 'em all.
- Hell, Johnny,
he ain't even gonna show.

1245

He'll show.

1247
01:45:32,622 --> 01:45:36,888
I spent my whole life not knowin'
what I wanted outta life,

1248
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:39,451
just chasin' my tail.

1249
01:45:39,529 --> 01:45:43,226
Now for the first time
I know exactly what I want,

1250
01:45:43,299 --> 01:45:45,699
and who.

1251
01:45:46,803 --> 01:45:49,670
And that's
the damnable misery of it.

1252
01:45:54,611 --> 01:45:57,273
What makes a man
like Ringo, Doc?

1253
01:45:57,347 --> 01:46:00,339
What makes him
do the things he does?

1254
01:46:00,416 --> 01:46:03,180
A man like Ringo...

1255
01:46:03,253 --> 01:46:07,485
got a great empty hole
right through the middle of him.

1256
01:46:08,925 --> 01:46:13,726
He can never kill enough
or steal enough...

1257
01:46:13,796 --> 01:46:16,663
or inflict enough pain
to ever fill it.

1258
01:46:16,733 --> 01:46:19,167
What does he need?

1259
01:46:20,370 --> 01:46:22,304
Revenge.

1260
01:46:25,608 --> 01:46:28,202
For what?

1261
01:46:32,982 --> 01:46:34,916
Bein' born.

1262
01:46:48,765 --> 01:46:50,790
It all happened so fast
with Curly Bill...

1263
01:46:50,867 --> 01:46:52,960
I didn't really have time
to think about it,

1264
01:46:53,036 --> 01:46:55,527
but I've had plenty of time
to think about this.

1265
01:47:02,745 --> 01:47:05,213
I can't beat him, can I?

1266
01:47:07,183 --> 01:47:09,344
No.

1267

Wait. [Coughs]
I'm goin' with ya.

Oh, God. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, Wyatt.

1270

It's all right, Doc.

1271

What's it like to wear
one of those?

Don't worry.

They want him,
they gotta come over us first.

1274
01:48:38,608 --> 01:48:43,602
He's waitin' for you by the big oak,
quarter mile up that trail.

1275
01:48:49,152 --> 01:48:52,451
They're not givin' ya
any safe conduct.

1276
01:48:52,522 --> 01:48:56,788
Shootin' starts, you better kick east
to the New Mexico line.

1277
01:48:59,295 --> 01:49:01,559
I ain't got the words.

Me neither.

01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:16,144
Well.

I didn't think
ya had it in you.

I'm your huckleberry.

just walked over your grave.

Fight's not with you, Holliday.

1286

I'll beg to differ, sir. We started
a game we never got to finish.

1288
01:49:51,548 --> 01:49:54,779
I was just foolin' about.

1289
01:49:56,386 --> 01:49:58,320
I wasn't.

1290
01:49:59,722 --> 01:50:01,917
And this time...

01:50:03,126 --> 01:50:05,720
it's legal.

Hello, Wyatt.

investigating the mysteries
of the church of Rome.

knows no bounds.

You're no hypocrite, Doc.
You just like to sound like one.

- You keep comin' back here.

I told you not to,
and I meant it.

Pretty much the same.

to our list of frailties.

She joined a convent
over the affair.

She was all I ever wanted.
