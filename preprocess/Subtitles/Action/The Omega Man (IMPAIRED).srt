MAN 2: After him!

317
00:46:50,744 --> 00:46:51,870
MATTHIAS: Back!

318
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:57,751
LISA: Okay, hold it. Open it up.

319
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:03,465
- You. You're the...
- Your living Playtex doll.

320
00:47:03,549 --> 00:47:06,343
Now, come on, man. Get the bike.
Move! Pull it out!

321
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:10,097
NEVILLE: You really plan ahead.
LISA: It helps.

322
00:47:10,472 --> 00:47:14,852
Now look, you gotta run this thing,
you understand, but I'm the ramrod.

323
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,980
Those stadium lights,
how'd you manage that?

324
00:47:18,063 --> 00:47:20,899
- Dutch knows all about that stuff.
- Dutch?

325
00:47:20,983 --> 00:47:23,277
Come on, man. Get on the bike.

326
00:47:29,158 --> 00:47:33,495
Don't screw up. I know how to roll,
but it's hard on the elbows.

327
00:47:34,163 --> 00:47:36,999
And if you just have to play James Bond...

328
00:47:37,499 --> 00:47:39,209
I'll bust your ass.

329
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:40,836
Yes, ma'am.

330

MATTHIAS: Don't let him get away!

331
00:48:05,027 --> 00:48:07,821
Goddamn it, left, and step on it!

332
00:48:24,713 --> 00:48:26,799
Move! Down the tunnel, man.

333
00:49:07,923 --> 00:49:09,925
Hit it. They're blinded.

334
00:49:10,551 --> 00:49:13,011
Okay, baby. Hitch up your drawers.

335
00:49:51,633 --> 00:49:54,678
- I thought we'd gotten past that.
- You're sweet.

336

It's okay, Tommy.

337

00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:49,066
This is it. That's all there is.

341
00:50:50,192 --> 00:50:52,152
At least all we know of.

342
00:50:52,736 --> 00:50:57,574
There are others, I guess, if Matthias
and his brethren haven't killed them all.

343
00:50:58,408 --> 00:51:00,869
I didn't know there were any left.

344

and you in the daytime...

man, we had to stay low.

346
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:19,513
I had to stay alive.

The mad bomber himself.

348
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:41,535
And I see you got the mad scientist.

349
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:44,663
- You know me?
- And about your work.

That's a nice recitation.
You know what it means?

356
00:52:07,269 --> 00:52:10,272
I was a med school senior
when they scratched the world.

357
00:52:10,355 --> 00:52:14,610
As a matter of fact, I was gonna apply
to Biowar Labs for my post-doc...

358
00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:18,280
DUTCH: But the next term never came.
NEVILLE: Sorry you didn't make it.

359
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:20,407
Sorry the world didn't make it.

360

Come on. Let's go see about Richie.

361
00:52:23,327 --> 00:52:26,622
Lisa's brother. He looks like
he's about to go over.

362
00:52:28,874 --> 00:52:32,169
You've only seen the tertiary cases,
Matthias and his people.

363
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:35,297
We're not that far gone,
but we're on the road.

364
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:39,092
LISA: The yellow brick road.
We're off to see the wizard.

DUTCH: When it hit, the older people
died or went to the third stage fast...

366

367
00:52:46,016 --> 00:52:50,729

torpor, like Matthias and the things there.

368
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,900
- What about you? Why didn't you get it?
- I don't know.

369

DUTCH: Some of the younger people
have a kind of...

370

371

I don't know, we just hold out.

372
00:53:05,536 --> 00:53:09,123
Some of us are a bit light-sensitive,
otherwise, we're all right.

373
00:53:09,206 --> 00:53:11,208
But Richie's definitely going.

374
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:14,002
He's advanced secondary. Incidentally...

375
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:17,297
mind telling me
what keeps you in the city?

376
00:53:17,506 --> 00:53:19,925
You some kind of exterminator?

377
00:53:21,009 --> 00:53:23,220
I guess maybe you could call it that.

378
00:53:23,804 --> 00:53:25,722
Very complicated, Doctor.

379
00:53:25,806 --> 00:53:29,560
I'd be living on top of City Hall,
or better, the Oxy Tower...

380
00:53:29,643 --> 00:53:31,687
instead of that pillbox you're in.

381

That's where I live.
It's where I used to live.

382
00:53:34,731 --> 00:53:38,235
It's where I'm going to live,
and not Matthias nor his Family...

383
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:41,363
nor any other son of a bitch
is going to make me leave.

384
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:46,034
He's no better.

- Shut up.

or he'll go over 10 minutes from now.

390

I've seen them go before.

391
00:54:30,954 --> 00:54:33,582
I almost got killed by a friend
of mine last summer.

392
00:54:33,665 --> 00:54:36,043
He went over without any warning.

393
00:54:36,335 --> 00:54:38,128
When I looked away...

394
00:54:38,879 --> 00:54:42,758
his face was pale and his hair was going.
When I looked back...

395
00:54:43,759 --> 00:54:45,719
he didn't have any eyes.

396
00:54:46,804 --> 00:54:48,388
NEVILLE: What did you do?

397
00:54:49,056 --> 00:54:52,100
I did just like you'd do, Doctor. I killed him.

398

401

Is there anything you can do, Doctor?

over 200 million patients.

- Everybody has it.
- Everybody but me.

It's got to be the serum.

415
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:08,427
Couldn't you reconstitute the vaccine?

416
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:10,637
You got any idea
how many steps it takes...

417

specific for this bug?

418

- Got the picture.
- I've tried. God knows I've tried.

419
00:56:18,395 --> 00:56:21,190
Once I caught one
of Matthias' people last year...

<i>and tried everything
on the shelves on him.</i>
