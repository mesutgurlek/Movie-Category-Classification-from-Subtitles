- From a friend.

He recommended your bank.

Yes.

This gold is all that is left of my people.

Melted from their possessions.
Torn from their teeth.

This is blood money.

find the bastards responsible for it.

- The NATO guy?
- Yeah.

- No.

So, I hear you blocked the proposal to position
Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

219
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:52,695
- I expect you'll reconsider.
- We've had this conversation.

220
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:56,674
You put our nukes in Turkey,
or anywhere that close to Russia,

221
00:17:56,821 --> 00:18:00,385
and you're looking at war.

So, let me say it again.
I expect you'll reconsider.

Come here.

00:20:13,938 --> 00:20:16,527
Missiles in Turkey send a very clear message.

239

We ever decided to fire them,

240

the Russians early warning system won't
even have time to kick in.

He was there McCone, in the Hellfire club.

Colonel Hendry?

246
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:35,906
I agree with you, General.
I've reconsidered my position.

247
00:20:36,014 --> 00:20:39,201
And I now believe that we should put
Jupiter Missiles in Turkey.

Colonel Hendry is here.

I was wondering, who you told
about our little arrangement?

324
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,668
No one.

325
00:26:45,196 --> 00:26:47,385
- He's telling the truth.
- Good.

326
00:26:47,488 --> 00:26:51,545
Well I guess we're done here.
Let's wrap things up, shall we?

327
00:26:55,571 --> 00:26:58,251
Well I knew better than to trust you.

328
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:02,481
Now you let me walk out of here
with my money.

329
00:27:02,482 --> 00:27:06,530
Or I will pull this pin and we all die.

330
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,399
Go ahead, pull it.

331
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,060
I'll do it, I swear to god.

332
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:23,259
No you won't.

333
00:27:28,393 --> 00:27:29,688
But I will.

334
00:27:30,302 --> 00:27:32,424

00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:44,367
You're one of them?

338
00:27:44,475 --> 00:27:48,298
Very astute of you, Colonel Hendry.
You want to guess what I can do?

339
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:51,308
I've got the power to absorb energy.
It keeps me young.

340
00:27:51,464 --> 00:27:52,936
That's the boring part.

341
00:27:53,096 --> 00:27:56,706
The fun stuff is what I can do with it
once I got it.

CIA Headquarters, Langley, Virginia

343
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:06,754
The advent of the nuclear age,
may have accelerated the mutation process.

344
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:11,729
Individual's with extraordinary abilities may
already be among us.

345
00:28:12,498 --> 00:28:13,492
Thank you very much.

346
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:16,583
MacTaggert, you really think that some crackpot scientist,

347
00:28:16,707 --> 00:28:20,298
is going to make me believe in sparkly dames
and vanishing men?

348
00:28:20,424 --> 00:28:23,167
You just brought yourself a one way ticket
back to the typing pool.

349
00:28:23,414 --> 00:28:24,889
This meeting is over.

350
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,549
Uh, please sit down agent, MacTaggert.

351
00:28:28,423 --> 00:28:30,372
I didn't really expect you to believe me.

352
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:32,431
Given that all you could think about during my presentation,

353
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:35,130
was what sort of pie they were serving in the commissary.

354
00:28:36,205 --> 00:28:38,060
It's apple pecan.

355
00:28:38,356 --> 00:28:40,683
I haven't been entirely honest with you, and I'm sorry.

356
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,870
You see, one of the many spectacular things my
mutation allows me to do.

357
00:28:44,987 --> 00:28:47,799
Is that I can your  mind.

358
00:28:47,911 --> 00:28:49,500
I've seen this before in a magic show.

359
00:28:49,652 --> 00:28:53,426
Are you going to ask us to think of a number
between one and ten now?

360
00:28:53,556 --> 00:28:55,206
No, agent Stryker.

361
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:58,700
Although I could ask  you about your son William who
you were thinking about,

362
00:28:58,808 --> 00:29:00,057
which is very nice

363
00:29:00,187 --> 00:29:02,245
But I think I'd rather ask you
about the Jupiter...

364
00:29:02,381 --> 00:29:04,985
...missiles America are currently placing in Turkey.

365
00:29:06,827 --> 00:29:09,546
He's a goddamn spy!
You brought a goddamn spy!

366
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:11,243
I did not, I would never bring one here!

367
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,199
[hissing]

368
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:28,584
[hissing]

369
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,383
How's that for a magic trick?

370
00:29:35,515 --> 00:29:37,843
Best I've ever seen.

371
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,915
I want them out of here.

372
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:43,221
And lock down until I can figure out
what to do.

373
00:29:44,173 --> 00:29:48,467
My facility is off site. I'll take them.

374
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,905
I can't believe this.

375
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:53,463
You'd think the director of the CIA
would have a little more composure.

376
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,961
We should be going after Shaw right now, but...

377
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,078
...instead he's up there worrying about the wrong mutants.

378
00:29:57,327 --> 00:29:58,409
What are we doing to do, Lavene?

379
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:02,014
Lavene?
Lavene, what's wrong with you?

380
00:30:04,393 --> 00:30:08,236
<i>Absolutely nothing, I've just frozen him for the
moment because I'd like to talk to you.</i>

381
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,522
<i>It's good, isn't it?</i>

382
00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:12,426
<i>I'm as interested in this Sebastian Shaw as you are,</i>

383
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:15,539
<i>..and if you still want my help, meet me on
the third floor of the parking garage.</i>

384
00:30:16,605 --> 00:30:19,315
I've always known that there were people like
you out there.

385
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:22,934
I've been the laughing stock of this agency
for years but I knew it.

386
00:30:23,027 --> 00:30:24,105
- You're going to love my facility.

387
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:25,993
- That's going to have to wait.
- Why?

388
00:30:26,136 --> 00:30:28,018
Agent MacTaggert has to lead us to Sebastian Shaw,

389
00:30:28,144 --> 00:30:30,436
and if we don't move now apparently
we're going to lose him.

390
00:30:30,608 --> 00:30:31,312
What?

391
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:34,586
Not only can he read minds,
he can communicate with them as well.

392
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,494
Moria and I have just had a lovely conversation.

393
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,521
- Yes, we did.
- That is incredible!

394
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:43,078
But I cannot take you anywhere else,
without permission from upstairs.

395
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,332
- Would you like to see one more magic trick?
- Okay.

396
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:47,023
- Get in the car.
- Good idea.

397
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:58,440
[rippling]

398

[dipping water sounds]

399
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:09,768
Herr Doctor...

400
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:16,055
the same old Erik Lensherr.

401
00:31:16,449 --> 00:31:17,928
He's here to kill you.

402
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:26,963
What kind of greeting is that?

403
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:31,890
After so many years?

404
00:31:41,478 --> 00:31:42,987
Emma...

405
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,988
We don't harm our own kind.

406
00:31:48,512 --> 00:31:50,116
Ah, now it's a party.

407
00:31:51,165 --> 00:31:55,784
This is the US Coast guard.
Do not attempt to move your vessel.

408
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,714
Stay where you are.

409
00:32:03,864 --> 00:32:05,204
They have a telepath.

410
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,500
I've lost, Shaw!

411
00:32:10,818 --> 00:32:12,536
I've lost, I've lost, Shaw.

412
00:32:12,537 --> 00:32:15,439
There's, there's something blocking me.
This has never happened to me before.

413
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,245
I think there's someone like
me on that ship.

414
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:20,177
- Like you?
- I'm sorry, a telepath.

415
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:22,804
This is incredible, I can actually feel
her inside my mind.

416
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:24,736
I'm very sorry, but I don't think I'm
going to be much help to you tonight.

417
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:25,840
You're on your own.

00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:57,261
Charles! You okay?

425
00:32:57,369 --> 00:32:58,877
There's someone else out there.

426
00:33:02,808 --> 00:33:04,097
There!

427
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:08,186
Time to go.

428
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:04,657
Let go!

429
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:08,014
Better let it go!

430
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,917
You've got help him...there's
someone in the water, help him!

431
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:13,458
Let it go!
You have to let it go!

432
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:36,623
<i>You can't, you'll drown.
You have to let go.</i>

433
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:39,444
<i>I know what this means to you
but you're going to die.</i>

434
00:34:39,725 --> 00:34:43,765
<i>Please, Erik, calm your mind.</i>

435
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:57,118
Get off of me, get off!

436
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,609
Calm down,
Oh just breath.

437
00:34:58,609 --> 00:34:59,220
We're here!

438
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:01,567
- Who are you?
-  My name is Charles Xavier.

439
00:35:01,689 --> 00:35:03,565
You were in my head.

440
00:35:03,842 --> 00:35:05,184
How did you do that?

441
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:06,604
You have your tricks, I have mine.

442
00:35:06,713 --> 00:35:09,132
I'm like you, just calm your mind.

443
00:35:11,493 --> 00:35:15,348
- I thought I was alone.
- You're not alone.

444
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:20,165
Erik, you're not alone.

445
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:26,094
Secret CIA base.

446
00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:42,114
Welcome to my facility.

447
00:35:42,993 --> 00:35:44,518
My mission has been to investigate the

448
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:48,109
application of paranormal powers
for military defense.

449
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:49,509
Or offense.

450
00:35:49,806 --> 00:35:52,914
This guy, Shaw, Schmidt, whatever
you want to call him.

451
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,725
He's working with the Russians.

452
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,404
We might need your help to stop them.

453
00:35:56,518 --> 00:35:57,407
Marvelous.

454
00:35:57,532 --> 00:36:00,227
So we're to be the CIA's new
mutant division, yes?

455
00:36:01,405 --> 00:36:02,619
Something like that.

456
00:36:06,277 --> 00:36:10,529
It's a supersonic. The most advanced plane
ever built.

457
00:36:11,828 --> 00:36:14,888
You should see it in real life.
It's incredible.

458
00:36:14,997 --> 00:36:18,853
Hank, these are the special new recruits I
was telling you about.

459
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:19,940
This is, Hank McCoy,

460
00:36:20,068 --> 00:36:22,037
One of our most talented young researchers.

461
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:25,727
How wonderful, another mutant.
Already here.

462
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,537
- Why didn't you say?
- Say what?

463
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:31,905
Because you don't know.

464
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:35,793
I am so, so terribly sorry!

465
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:39,611
Hank?

466
00:36:39,736 --> 00:36:41,702
You didn't ask, so I didn't tell.

467
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:45,619
So  your mutation's what?
You're super smart?

468
00:36:45,762 --> 00:36:48,956
I'll say, Hank here graduated honors at the age of fifteen.

469
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,858
I wish that's all it was.

470
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:55,575
You're among friends now, Hank.
You could show off.

471
00:37:11,637 --> 00:37:12,871
Splendid.

472
00:37:18,596 --> 00:37:20,796
- Sorry.
- Yes, yes.

00:37:23,155 --> 00:37:23,647

799
01:04:56,666 --> 01:05:01,133
Be enslaved, or rise up to rule.

800
01:05:02,155 --> 01:05:05,301
Choose freely, but know that if you are not with us,

801
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:08,139
then by definition you are against us.

802
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:14,977
So, you can stay, and fight for the
people who hate, and fear you.

803
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:20,022
Or you can join me.
And live like kings.

804
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,553
And Queens.

805
01:05:39,111 --> 01:05:40,786
- Angel?
- Are you kidding me?

806
01:05:41,617 --> 01:05:44,768
Come on, we don't belong here.

807
01:05:45,623 --> 01:05:47,594
And that's nothing to be ashamed of.

808
01:05:52,846 --> 01:05:54,192
We have to do something.

809
01:06:09,993 --> 01:06:12,992
Stop, I'm coming with you.

810
01:06:16,801 --> 01:06:17,902
Good choice.

811
01:06:19,552 --> 01:06:21,638
So tell me about your mutation.

812
01:06:22,377 --> 01:06:23,969
Well, I adapt to survive.

813
01:06:27,503 --> 01:06:30,598
- So I guess I'm coming with you.
- I like that.

814
01:06:37,476 --> 01:06:39,171
- Alex, do it!
- Get out!

815
01:06:39,172 --> 01:06:40,172
Do it.

816
01:06:41,171 --> 01:06:44,084
<Whirling, swirling, and swoosh>

817
01:06:45,421 --> 01:06:46,860
Protecting your fellow mutants?

818
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,298
It's a noble gesture.
Feels good.

819
01:06:57,644 --> 01:06:59,105
Adapt to this.

820
01:07:29,786 --> 01:07:33,047
Moscow, Russia

821
01:07:34,304 --> 01:07:35,495
[sonic boom]

822
01:07:43,408 --> 01:07:44,408
Hello.

823
01:07:46,399 --> 01:07:54,616
Once again, my sympathies for your
treatment at the hands of the CIA.

824
01:07:54,617 --> 01:07:56,895
These American's are ruthless.

825
01:07:57,876 --> 01:08:02,119
Now they have their missiles placed in Turkey.

826
01:08:03,194 --> 01:08:07,766
I expect you'll be planning new
missile sites of your own.

827
01:08:07,767 --> 01:08:14,250
Somewhere where you know the American early
warning system won't help.

828
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:19,540
I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year.

829
01:08:19,621 --> 01:08:22,388
And so close to Florida.

830
01:08:23,595 --> 01:08:25,034
Missiles in Cuba?

831
01:08:27,789 --> 01:08:29,031
You're serious?

832
01:08:29,698 --> 01:08:32,778
We may as well declare war.

833
01:08:34,162 --> 01:08:36,084
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

834
01:08:38,588 --> 01:08:40,490
You will make this happen.

835
01:08:43,012 --> 01:08:44,043
Okay.

836
01:08:44,738 --> 01:08:47,216
Let's see what KGB think about this.

837
01:08:51,654 --> 01:08:54,777
Hello, General Armivolkoff.

838
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,798
It's nothing.

839
01:09:16,009 --> 01:09:16,770
Raven.

840
01:09:23,322 --> 01:09:25,265
We've made arrangements for you to
be taken home immediately.

841
01:09:25,545 --> 01:09:26,893
- We're not going home.
- What?

842
01:09:27,446 --> 01:09:30,323
- He's not going back to prison.
- They killed, Darwin.

843
01:09:30,747 --> 01:09:32,358
All the more reason for you to leave.

844
01:09:32,583 --> 01:09:33,487
This is over.

845
01:09:33,966 --> 01:09:37,331
Darwin is dead, Charles.
And we can't even bury him.

846
01:09:40,658 --> 01:09:42,173
We can avenge him.

847
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:46,998
Erik, word please.

848
01:09:51,027 --> 01:09:53,631
- They're just kids.
- No, they were kids.

849
01:09:54,196 --> 01:09:56,336
Shaw has his army, we need ours.

850
01:10:02,423 --> 01:10:05,583
We'll have to train.
All of us.

851
01:10:06,490 --> 01:10:08,262
- Yes?
- Yeah.

852
01:10:09,161 --> 01:10:10,447
Well we can't stay here.

853
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:13,348
Even if they reopen the department,
it's not safe.

854
01:10:14,321 --> 01:10:16,314
We've got nowhere to go.

855
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,268
Yes, we do.

856
01:10:21,215 --> 01:10:23,017
The law says we've got to turn her over.

857
01:10:23,282 --> 01:10:25,347
The law applies to human beings.

858
01:10:25,585 --> 01:10:28,642
The same laws don't apply to mutants.
They're too dangerous.

859
01:10:28,961 --> 01:10:32,608
Times like this, security is more
important than liberty.

860
01:10:33,161 --> 01:10:37,812
- There's a war coming, John.
- Yes, but a war with who?

861
01:10:52,013 --> 01:10:53,199
Excellent question.

862
01:10:54,228 --> 01:10:56,043
Though I won't call it a war exactly.

863
01:10:57,074 --> 01:10:59,997
That suggests both sides stand an
equal chance of winning.

864
01:11:10,163 --> 01:11:12,596
Captain, no sign of any American ships.

865
01:11:12,597 --> 01:11:15,200
Maintain course, full ahead.

866
01:11:15,929 --> 01:11:18,414
The Russians have sent their warheads to Cuba.

867
01:11:18,868 --> 01:11:20,947
We have a week before their ship hits the coast.

868
01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:25,332
Our fleet can be on this line,
when the Russian missile ship arrives.

869
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:30,983
If that ship crosses the line, they will have
declared war against the United States.

870
01:11:32,016 --> 01:11:34,939
We will have no choice but to retaliate
with a full nuclear response.

871
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:37,190
Do we agree?

872
01:11:42,317 --> 01:11:43,603
Dispatch the Seventh fleet.

873
01:11:46,981 --> 01:11:50,507
- This is yours?
- No, it's ours.

874
01:11:56,974 --> 01:11:59,786
Honestly Charles, I don't know how you survived.

875
01:12:00,303 --> 01:12:01,836
Living in such hardship.

876
01:12:02,138 --> 01:12:04,711
Well it was a hardship softened by me.

877
01:12:08,016 --> 01:12:10,541
Come on, time for the tour.

878
01:12:17,787 --> 01:12:20,346
Moscow, Russia

879
01:12:22,846 --> 01:12:24,561
Dear comrades.

880
01:12:24,562 --> 01:12:32,109
The United States have dispatched
war ships for Cuba.

881
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:36,600
This leaves us with no choice.

882
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:41,347
Comrade First Secretary.

883
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:45,181
We must send in our fleet.

884
01:12:47,912 --> 01:12:49,874
Dispatch the fleet!

885
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:50,875

[Flash]

887

<i>(TV): President Kennedy has
signed a formal proclamation.</i>

888
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:02,298
<i>Setting up a blockade of all missiles,
armed for Cuba.</i>

889
01:13:03,374 --> 01:13:09,593
<i>The Soviet Union reacted by terming it
as step along the road to unleashing a thermal nuclear war.</i>

890
01:13:20,248 --> 01:13:22,640
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

891
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:24,391
Hold it.

892
01:13:31,732 --> 01:13:33,797
No, I can't I'm sorry.

893
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,193
I can't shoot anybody point blank,

894
01:13:35,422 --> 01:13:36,173
let alone my friend.

895
01:13:36,451 --> 01:13:38,075
Oh come on, you know I can deflect it.

896
01:13:38,318 --> 01:13:39,569
You're always telling me I should push myself.

897
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:43,026
If you know you can deflect it, then
you're not challenging yourself.

898
01:13:44,755 --> 01:13:47,373
Whatever happened to the man
who was trying to raise a submarine?

899
01:13:48,443 --> 01:13:49,193
What, I can't.

900
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,842
Something that big, I need the situation, the anger.

901
01:13:53,072 --> 01:13:54,446
No, the anger isn't enough.

902
01:13:55,377 --> 01:13:56,970
It's gotten the job done all this time.

903
01:13:57,230 --> 01:13:58,781
It's nearly gotten you killed all this time.

904
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:01,144
Hey, come here.

905
01:14:02,294 --> 01:14:03,563
Let's try something a little more challenging.

906
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:08,885
My step-father took the possibility
of nuclear war quite seriously.

907
01:14:09,133 --> 01:14:10,068
This way.

908
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:12,325
That's why he had this bunker built down here.

909
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,893
I thought we could use it as a practice range of sort.

910
01:14:15,114 --> 01:14:16,232
You don't think I'm going to blow though the walls?

911
01:14:16,867 --> 01:14:19,368
No, he had this place built to
with stand a nuclear bomb.

912
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:21,041
I think it can handle you, Alex.

913
01:14:21,227 --> 01:14:22,995
You know when I do this,
bad things tend to happen.

914
01:14:24,016 --> 01:14:26,954
It's because you can't control it.
It controls you.

915
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:30,710
That's why we're here, Alex.
To start your training.

916
01:14:31,336 --> 01:14:31,909

919
01:14:35,785 --> 01:14:37,002
What you're doing is incredible.

920
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:40,057
You're hitting a pitch sound that at
the same resonate frequency of the glass.

921
01:14:40,282 --> 01:14:41,054
That's why it shatters.

922
01:14:41,353 --> 01:14:44,635
This is like any other muscle in the body.
You can control it.

"In each of us, two natures are at war."

Robert Louis Stevenson,
"Jekyll and Hyde".

925
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:52,529
Top marks.

926
01:14:53,032 --> 01:14:54,891
Still it really wasn't really about good
and evil. Was it, Hank.

927
01:14:55,095 --> 01:14:58,110
It was about man's animal nature,
and his struggle to control it.

928
01:14:58,315 --> 01:14:59,283
To conform.

929
01:14:59,549 --> 01:15:01,581
It is that struggle which is holding you back.

930
01:15:02,254 --> 01:15:04,497
Jekyll is afraid of what he could be capable of.

931
01:15:04,934 --> 01:15:05,920
You are too.

932
01:15:06,639 --> 01:15:08,919
If you're serious about me doing this,
you might want to get back.

933
01:15:09,361 --> 01:15:12,542
- Of course, should I shut the door?
- Yeah.

934
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:16,544
Whenever you're ready.

935
01:15:24,527 --> 01:15:25,371
My god.

936
01:15:29,145 --> 01:15:31,127
I will teach you to control this, Alex.

937
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:36,314
You're sure that this will work.

938
01:15:37,024 --> 01:15:39,125
Anything is possible. I based the design...

939
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:41,452
Hank, stop talking.
Come on.

940
01:15:41,595 --> 01:15:43,331
Now remember, scream as hard as you can.

941
01:15:43,601 --> 01:15:45,254
You need the sound waves to be supersonic.

942
01:15:45,472 --> 01:15:47,211
Catch them at the right angle,
and they should carry you.

943
01:15:47,966 --> 01:15:51,104
"They should carry me."
That's reassuring.

944
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,851
Good luck.

945
01:15:53,606 --> 01:15:54,878
And don't forget to scream.

946
01:16:04,817 --> 01:16:08,027
If you want to beat me this time,
you have to set the beast free.

947
01:16:09,692 --> 01:16:13,385
On your marks, get set...GO!

948
01:16:29,016 --> 01:16:30,207
Oh, congratulations my friend.

949
01:16:30,895 --> 01:16:32,449
Robert Louis Stevenson
would have been proud.

950
01:16:34,683 --> 01:16:35,605
Impressive, Hank.

951
01:16:36,273 --> 01:16:38,042
Feet like those, all you need is a red nose.

952
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:39,350
Right, Bozo?

953
01:16:40,211 --> 01:16:41,664
- I'm done here.
- Thank you, Alex

954
01:16:43,376 --> 01:16:44,306
Come on, Hank.

955
01:16:55,455 --> 01:16:58,299
If you're using half the concentration to look normal.

956
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:01,308
Then you're only half paying attention to
whatever else you do.

957
01:17:02,082 --> 01:17:04,199
Just pointing out something that could save your life.

01:17:09,027 --> 01:17:10,797
You want society to accept you.

959
01:17:11,779 --> 01:17:13,549
But you can't even accept yourself.

960
01:17:20,356 --> 01:17:21,254

This is just the prototype.

You ought to see this. Your genes are
extraordinary, you know that.

Your cells age at half the rate of a normal human.

All right Alex, I want you to hit the X.

- Yes, Hank. You're still a Bozo.

But nice job.

Try turning it to face us.

somewhere between rage and serenity.

What did you just do to me?

994
01:20:26,167 --> 01:20:29,465
I accessed the brightest corner
of your memory system.

995
01:20:31,562 --> 01:20:33,784
It's a very beautiful memory Erik, thank you.

01:20:34,973 --> 01:20:36,835
I didn't know I still had that.

997

There's so much more to you than you know.

998

Not just pain, and anger.
There's good too, I felt it.

And when you can access all that.

1000
01:20:49,323 --> 01:20:51,950
You will possess a power no one can match.

The President is about to make his address.

he wants' to start world war III.

He won't leave anything to chance.

<i>All diplomatic efforts to avert

The world is primed for war.
And there's no one to stop me.

Come in.

Got a surprise for you.

I isolated the right marker in your DNA sample.

The serum works like an anti-biotic.

Attacking the cells that cause our physical mutation.

It won't affect your abilities,
just your appearance.

Do you still want to do this?

Should we have to hide?

You already do.

You're hiding right now.

I don't want to feel like a freak, all the time.

All we will achieve.

1043
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:10,701
We are different. But we shouldn't
be trying to fit into society.

1044
01:24:11,848 --> 01:24:14,232
Society should inspire and be more like us.

Mutant, and proud.

It behooves me to tell you,
but even if we save the world tomorrow.

And mutants are accepted into society.

...tomorrow mankind will know that mutants exist.

They'll fear us, and that
fear will turn to hatred.

Not if we stop a war.
Not if we can prevent, Shaw.

Not if we risk our lives doing so.

As to think they won't battle their own extinction?

02:00:26,543 --> 02:00:27,794
<i>In this decade.</i>

1433
02:00:30,937 --> 02:00:33,112
So how many students do you think 
you'll have here?

1434
02:00:33,112 --> 02:00:35,572
Once you get the academy up and running.

1435
02:00:35,844 --> 02:00:39,695
As many as I can manage, and Possibly more.

1436
02:00:42,709 --> 02:00:47,287
You know, one day the government is going
to realize how lucky they were,

1437
02:00:47,491 --> 02:00:49,187
..to have Professor X on their side.

1438
02:00:50,808 --> 02:00:53,073
As I suppose I am on the
road to a professor now, aren't I ?.

1439
02:00:53,302 --> 02:00:54,996
First thing I'll be going bald.

1440
02:00:56,490 --> 02:00:58,606
We're still on the government side, Moira.

1441
02:00:59,347 --> 02:01:01,736
We're still a G-man, just without the G.

1442
02:01:02,409 --> 02:01:04,955
No, you're your own team now.

1443
02:01:05,941 --> 02:01:07,069
It's better.

1444
02:01:08,193 --> 02:01:10,632
You're, "X-Men".

1445
02:01:10,633 --> 02:01:11,633
[chuckle]

1446
02:01:13,214 --> 02:01:14,347
Guess, I'll like the sound of that.

1447
02:01:15,145 --> 02:01:20,979
Moira, for us anonymity will be the first line of defense.

1448
02:01:21,499 --> 02:01:22,937
I know.

1449
02:01:24,129 --> 02:01:27,590
They can threaten me all they want, Charles.

1450
02:01:28,726 --> 02:01:30,699
I'll never tell them where you are.

1451
02:01:31,634 --> 02:01:32,637
Ever.

1452
02:01:33,683 --> 02:01:35,022
I know you won't.

1453
02:01:36,926 --> 02:01:38,392
My love.

1454
02:01:45,844 --> 02:01:48,034
I remember the attack on HQ.

1455
02:01:48,696 --> 02:01:50,243
Leaving to go somewhere else.

1456
02:01:51,215 --> 02:01:54,183
And then this morning, I woke up at home.

1457
02:01:55,094 --> 02:01:56,085
That's it.

1458
02:01:57,486 --> 02:01:59,525
All that time wiped clean from your mind.

1459
02:01:59,962 --> 02:02:01,122
Just gone.

1460
02:02:01,577 --> 02:02:03,373
He can do that.
You don't remember anything?

1461
02:02:04,123 --> 02:02:11,616
Sometimes I get fragments.
Like trees, sunlight.

1462
02:02:14,019 --> 02:02:16,334
- A kiss.
- Aw, Jesus.

1463
02:02:17,212 --> 02:02:20,873
Gentlemen, this is why the CIA
is no place for a woman.

1464
02:02:21,788 --> 02:02:22,801
[Powerful plonk, Crash]

1465
02:02:25,626 --> 02:02:26,636
What the hell was that?

1466
02:02:36,343 --> 02:02:38,411
[scrunching and snapping the door  ]

1467
02:02:43,671 --> 02:02:45,992
I know we've had our differences.

1468
02:02:48,565 --> 02:02:52,120
- Where's your telepath friend?
- Gone.

1469
02:02:53,463 --> 02:02:56,471
Left a bit of a gap in my life.
If I'm to be honest.

1470
02:02:56,601 --> 02:02:58,689
I was rather hoping you would fill it.

1471
02:03:03,857 --> 02:03:04,730
Join us.

1472
02:03:12,331 --> 02:03:13,892
Erik, I believe.

1473
02:03:17,595 --> 02:03:19,311
I prefer...

1474
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:22,201
...Magneto.

1475
02:03:22,202 --> 02:03:23,202
