REPORTER: (ON RADIO) People
have to realize, we cannot
make everybody totally safe,

2
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,940
even if we allocated
the entire federal
budget towards security.

3
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,610
I promise you there
is not an easier job...

00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,287
Yeah.

7
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,039
I know. I'm sorry.

8
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,168
No, no, you can trust me.
I'm fine.

(PLANE APPROACHING)

10
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,296
What? I can't hear you.

11
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,465
I can't hear you!

you got a light?

14
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,911
Sir. Excuse me.

15
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,831
Excuse me, sir.
You got a light?

16
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,332
Yeah. Sorry.

17
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,255
WOMAN: (ON PA) May I have
your attention, please?

18
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,716
MAN: So, where you off to?

19
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,974
Where you headed?

20
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,399
I'm headed to Amsterdam.

21
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,571
WOMAN: (ON PA) May I have
your attention, please?

22
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,071
The white zone is for
the immediate loading

23
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,532
and unloading of
passengers only.

24
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,456
Here you go, sir.
Enjoy your flight.

MAN: Everyone and
their mother's in the
game right now.

You got Korean phones,
Japanese phones,
Scandinavian phones.

27
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,632
OS is trying to keep up
with the hardware from 15
different manufacturers.

28
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,509
Right!

29
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,929
That's what I've
been saying. No
one listens to me!

30
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:46,475
Dude, you're
preaching to the choir!
It makes absolutely no sense.

31
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,771
Really?
I guess I'm
in your way.

32
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,025
New Yorkers,
man, I swear to God.
Give me two minutes.

33
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,077
Clear.

34
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:06,913
Right this way, sir. Please.

35
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:11,584
Listen to me. Listen to me.
I cannot stay in
London for three days.

36
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,294
Get me on the next flight back.

37
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,672
Please, look. This is...

38
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,799
This is a bad time for...

39
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,513
"You have to do
what you have to do."
Well, guess what? So do I.

40
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,362
Here.

41
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,031
Long flights are the worst.

42
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,366
No, thanks.

43
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,967
Hi, baby.

44
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,886
MAN: (ON PA) Good evening,
passengers.

45
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,644
WOMAN: There's a mix-up
with my reservation.

46
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,855
I was supposed to
have a window seat
and they put me in an aisle.

47
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,774
Maybe you could move
some people around,

48
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,067
'cause I was guaranteed
the window seat.

49
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,472
I'm sorry about that,
Ms. Summers.

MAN: (ON PA) At this time
we are inviting passengers

or who require assistance,
to board at this time.

52
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,134
Once again,
in the boarding area,

53
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,303
we are ready to
begin our priority
boarding Flight 10 to London.

54
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,180
We'll begin general boarding
in just a few minutes.

55
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,557
WOMAN: Are you all
set to board?

56
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:50,850
GIRL: So we have to
go on the runway?

57
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,560
Come on, sweetheart.
Is this everything?

58
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,729
Yeah. My mom checked
my big bag for me.

59
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,564
Have you flown by
yourself before?

60
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,441
No. This is my first time.

61
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,235
WOMAN: You're gonna
have a lovely time.

62
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,448
NANCY: Welcome aboard.
Yes, just through there
and down to the left.

63
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,159
Nancy, this is Becca.
It's her first
time on an airplane.

64
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,578
Wonderful.
Who's waiting
for you in London?

65
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:11,787
My dad.

66
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,290
Well, we've a seat
by the window all
picked out for you.

67
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:27,136
Look, I know it may
seem scary, but
flying's really quite fun.

68
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,557
I believe this little
guy made a run for it.

69
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:33,976
What's his name?

70
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,062
Henry.

71
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,773
Yeah, he looks like
a Henry. That's
a good name.

72
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,399
Well...
Becca.

73
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,736
Becca, I think
Henry's a little scared.

74
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,697
Maybe you can show
him how it's done.

75
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,910
Good girl.

76
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,720
I'm sorry, am I in your way?

77
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,263
Again?

78
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,891
We are right up here.

79
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,352
ATTENDANT: (ON PA)
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

80
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,438
As a reminder,
all carry-on luggage
must fit in the overhead bin

81
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,316
or be safely stowed
under the seat
in front of you.

82
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,827
If you're having
trouble fitting your luggage,

83
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,529
we'll be happy to
check it for you.

84
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,533
Thank you for
choosing British Aqualantic.
Enjoy the flight.

85
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,452
JEN: Do you know,
is there somebody
sitting there?

86
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,287
Do you know who has that seat?
No, sorry.

87
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,081
WOMAN: Is somebody
sitting here?

88
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,127
Hey, I'm on the plane.
And guess what?
They effed up my reservation.

89
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,004
We land at 7:35.
Did they book a car?

90
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,089
Hang on. Hang on.

91
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:49,343
Excuse me.
Sir? I'm here in 3B.

92
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,803
I was wondering if
maybe you'd switch seats

93
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,248
with me so I
could have the window?

94
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,806
Do you care?

95
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,392
Do you speak English?

96
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,769
Okay. Thank you.

97
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,022
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sir?

98
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,733
Hi. I'm right here,
I'm in 3B

99
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,486
and I was just wondering
if maybe you would
prefer the aisle,

100
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,655
or if you don't care,
if you would

101
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,157
switch with me
for the window seat?

102
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,411
A lot of people
just sleep anyway,
so I was wondering if...

103
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,042
Sure. Why not?

104
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:25,087
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate that.

105
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,631
Sorry,
let me get out
of your way.

106
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,008
Let me help you.

110
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,857
Oh, God.

111
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,026
WOMAN: (ON CELL PHONE)
Hello? Are you there?

112
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,110
Your phone.

113
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,195
What?
Hello?

114
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,362
Your phone.
Oh, shit.

115
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,822
Hello?
Hi. Hi, hi.

116
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:55,117
I'll call you
when we land, okay?
All right, bye.

117
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,535
Rough day, huh?

118
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,037
Yeah, you have no idea.

119
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,622
Hi, excuse me.

120
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,540
Could I get a gin and tonic,
when you get a chance?

121
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,168
Of course.
Make that two, please.

122
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,551
God.

123
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,055
Nancy, right? Gwen.
Yeah.

124
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,181
Thank God for you.

125
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,766
Girl doesn't show
up and leaves me

126
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,392
to handle two cabins.
You're a lifesaver.

127
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,917
If I pass out,
just promise to catch me
before I hit the floor.

128
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,521
Not if I do first.

129
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,399
Can I get you
gentlemen anything
before we taxi?

130
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,443
No, thanks, Nance, I'm fine.

131
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,826
What?

132
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,245
Nothing.

133
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,290
Ground, this is AQ-10,
we're ready to
disconnect ground power.

134
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,376
You naughty boy.

135
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,670
(CHUCKLES) Naughty.

136
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,014
Thank you.

137
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,769
Didn't you order gin and tonic?

138
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,937
Did I?

139
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,689
'Cause she brought you a water.

140
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,942
It's not my lucky day.

141
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,342
CAPTAIN: (ON PA) Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

142
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:39,638
welcome aboard British
Aqualantic Flight 10,
non-stop service to London.

143
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,640
I'm your captain,
David McMillan,

144
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,517
flying with First
Officer Kyle Rice.

145
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,162
And we expect
a smooth ride this evening

146
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,147
with a flight time of
just over six hours.
Seatbelts, thank you.

147
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,607
We should have you in
the air momentarily.

148
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,495
This is a beautiful
picture they took of her.

149
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,822
ATTENDANT: Sir, could you
move your seat-back forward?
Thank you.

150
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,075
Flight attendants,
please be seated for takeoff.

151
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,080
What's that for?
Is that for luck?

152
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,291
Something like that.
My daughter gave it to me.

153
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,793
Better than a gin
and tonic, I bet.

154
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:10,961
It is.

155
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,641
I'm Jen.

156
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,518
Bill.

157
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,856
You fly much?
All the time, actually.

158
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,524
Yeah, I can tell.

159
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:38,113
It's just the takeoff.
Once we're in the air, I'll...

160
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,411
You'll have a seizure?

161
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,704
I'll be fine. I promise.

162
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,792
You actually fly all the time?

163
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,503
Some things you
never get used to.

164
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,513
How old's your daughter?

165
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,349
Now, she's, uh, 17.

166
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,767
What's her name?

167
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,102
Olivia.

168
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,436
That's nice.
Yeah.

169
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,772
I like that name,
it's a nice name.

170
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,566
So, why'd she
give you the ribbon?

171
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:20,739
Some kids have blankets,
stuffed animals.
Olivia had ribbons.

172
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,575
This was hers
when she was little.

173
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:35,254
She'd tie it to
a finger or toe
before going to bed.

174
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,756
And then in the morning,
she'd make me guess.

175
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:38,882
Where she put it?
Yeah.

176
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,676
That's cute.
That's really cute.

177
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,095
Yeah, and then she grew up.

178
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,597
I suppose I need it
more than she did.

179
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,768
Anyway.

180
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,981
So, what do you do for a living?

181
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,693
Well...

182
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,487
I fly a lot.

183
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,697
Oh, yeah?

184
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:05,075
Yeah, but I think that

185
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,411
I'm gonna try to get some sleep.

186
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,413
Get some sleep, sure.
Yeah, it's gonna
be a long flight.

187
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sleep well.

I was a cop for 25 years.

Bill, what the hell
are you talking about?

Don't deny you sent these.

216

You and me.

how many have you had today?

Listen, how do you
kill somebody aboard

234
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,684
a crowded plane
and get away with it?

235
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,081
Pretty hard to pull that off,
don't you think?

236
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:55,003
Bill,
if there's not a situation,
you don't create one.

237
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,215
I'm going to see the captain.

238
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,508
You keep your eye
on the main cabin.

Bill? Don't panic
the cockpit. Bill?

I tell you, it's five hours in

241
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:15,065
and then, out of nowhere,
he suddenly sits
up and he says...

242
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,410
How do we
validate the threat?
We can't.

243
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,789
Captain?
TSA says a full cross check
on the passenger manifest

244
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,041
could take 25 to 30 minutes.

245
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,589
We can divert the flight,
if this is for real.

246
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,341
The nearest airport?

247
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,343
Well, it's 95
minutes back to Halifax,

248
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,513
two hours to Iceland,
three to London.

249
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,974
We're midway over the Atlantic.

250
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,149
You okay?

251
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,820
It's this juice fast I'm on.
Gives me the shakes.

252
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,658
It's your call, Bill.

253
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,744
Do we have a situation?

254
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,834
Can we review the footage?

255
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,336
It's recorded directly
to the black box.

256
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,922
But I can watch
all the camera feeds
live from the galley?

257
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,007
Yeah.

258
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,842
Get back on the line with TSA.

259
00:22:23,926 --> 00:22:25,885
See if they can back trace
this account number.

260
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,097
In the meantime,
I'll need
the passenger manifest.

261
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,721
I'll see if I can find him.

262
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:35,437
But in 10 minutes,
I'd like you to switch off
the network system.

263
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,481
We don't want
him checking to see
if a transfer's been made.

264
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,109
Nancy, come with me.

265
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,665
Two cameras in business,
six in coach.

266
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,916
We're gonna need more eyes.

267
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,209
I'll get another attendant.

268
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,878
How well do you know the crew?

269
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,629
Not very well.

270
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,096
Excuse me.
Yeah?

271
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,182
Will you come with me, please?

272
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,311
Now?

273
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,647
You want me to come right now?

274
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:27,739
This is a bad idea.

275
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,365
She was sitting beside
me when this started.

276
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,118
The only two people
I trust on this
airplane are you and her.

277
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,537
Trust me with what?
What's going on?

278
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,500

passenger with a phone

279

or acting like
they have a phone.

280
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,712
I'm not sure I understand
what it is you
want me to do...

281
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,464

And as you know,
protocol dictates
in these situations...

316
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,829
we corroborate everything
with the second
officer on board.

20G again.

318
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:04,998
It's not him.

319
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,500
It's not who?
Look, I'd rather not
jump to any conclusions.

320
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,461
Listen, Bill,
I don't think you're in
a position to sort out

00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,171
who's a suspect or
not at this point.

322

00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,888
Bill?

324
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,891
Agent Marks,
I need some sort of
acknowledgment from you.

325
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,143
Bill?

326
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,562
Agent Marks?

327
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,390
Marks, you need to answer me.

328
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,773
Hang on.

329
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,160
Marks, are you there?

330
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:43,786

Hand it over!
What're you...

334
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,507
Bill, look at me, okay?
I need this money.

335
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,592
I can cut you in...

00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,010
Give me
the goddamn phone, Jack.
Just listen to me.

337
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,553
Give me the phone...

00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,105
Jack! You son-of-a-bitch.

339
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,523
Give it up, Marks.
Stop it!

340
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:13,858

Stop it.

Don't do this, Jack.

346
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,484
Stop it!

347
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,780
Don't.

It's probably just a hoax.

No, it was nothing.

I dropped my stupid
phone in the sink.

Oh, God, I do that all the time.

394
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,904
I lost like five
phones in six months,

395
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,198

this little trick.

00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,328
So, should I be worried?

No, not at all.

399
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,582
It was a mistake to
involve you, I'm sorry.

400
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,752
So, if it's not him,
then why do you
have his phone?

401
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,338
I have to be careful, even when

there's nothing to
be concerned about.

403

It's my job.

404
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,219
As a passenger,
don't I have the right
to know what's going on?

Listen... Jen, right?
Yeah.

406
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,599
It's an innocent prank.
Some kid with a cell phone.

407
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:40,810
If it was on the ground,
I'd catch him

408
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,645
in two seconds flat,
but up here,

409
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,022

500 miles an hour,
I can't track his phone.

410
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,107
There's nothing I can do.

411
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,311
There's nothing you can do?
Aren't you an air marshal?

412
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,392
Ma'am,
please return
to your seat.

413
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:52,780
Did you just call me "ma'am"?

414
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,324
Please return to your seat.

415
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,909
Seriously?
Did you call me "ma'am"?

00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,329
Okay, Bill.

418
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,289

423
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,320
Sorry.
The indicator
must be broken.

424
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,239
I was looking for Agent Hammond.

425
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,033
What's wrong?

426
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,005
Nancy, wait. Wait!

427
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,425
Nancy, please.

428
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:20,261
Calm down, calm down.

429
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,679
Calm down.

430
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,848
Please, I can explain this.

431
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,599
Okay?

432
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,397
This is a setup.

433
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,066
The captain just
told me that the account

434
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,527
they want the money
wired to is in my name.

435
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,363
Do you think I would
extort $150 million

436
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,283
using an account in my own name?

437
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,119
He was transporting
cocaine, Nancy.

438
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,455
Whoever we're
looking for knew that.

439
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,292
He threatened Hammond,
made him paranoid.

440
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,628
I found out,
and Hammond
tried to kill me.

441
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,841
The person who's doing
this, he wants it
to look like this.

442
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,469
Like two federal agents
are the ones
doing this, not him.

443
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,141
Jack pulled a gun on me.
I had no choice.

444
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,312
Nancy?

445
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,648
I had no choice.

446
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,319
You know me.

447
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,823
You know
I could never do
something like this.

448
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,618
Look at me.

449
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,126
I need you to believe me.

450
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:38,672
I believe you.

451
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:45,179
In 13 minutes,
someone else will die,
unless I find him first.

452
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,183
I need you to help me.

453
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,607
BILL: (ON PA) Ladies and
gentlemen, may I have your
attention, please?

454
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,442
My name is Bill Marks.

455
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,278
I'm the federal air marshal
assigned to this flight.

456
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:03,572
I apologize for the disturbance.

457
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,908
The TSA has recently
instituted a policy

458
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,452
of random searches
aboard international flights.

459
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,456
Unfortunately,
this is one of three lucky
flights this month.

460
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,291
I'm gonna be coming
through the cabin.

461
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:16,168
If I call your
name and seat number,

462
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,128
please stand up and
move into the aisle.

463
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:24,259
If you're in possession
of an illegal substance,
item or weapon,

464
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,705
it's best to just
step forward now.

465
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,430
Captain,
you might want to hear this.

466
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:31,809
BILL: I need everybody
to place both hands on
the seat in front of you.

467
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,978

468
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,063
Right now!

469
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,566
Contact TSA,
tell them we have
a possible hijacking.

470
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:43,904
Nancy, what's going on?
It's just a random search.

471
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,950
Thank you.

472
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,493
Excuse me.

473
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,245
Jennifer Summers?

474
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,331
Should I have told you
about the bomb in my bag?

475
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:57,292
Let's not use that
word on a plane, please.

476

Everything's under control.

634
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,779
Excuse me. Excuse me.

635
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,072
Is the captain okay?

636
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,115
Dr. Nasir?
I didn't do anything, I...

637
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,951
Come with me, now.

638
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:54,996
Marshal!
Is someone gonna tell us
what the hell is going on?

639
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,081
I need your help.

640
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,457
Hey! People are scared!

641
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,126
We have a right to know
why you searched us.

642
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,879
Why this plane almost went down!

643
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:05,131
Hey, Marshal, you and I
are gonna have a conversation.

644
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,884
Don't you walk away from me.

645
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:09,219
Doctor, cockpit, now!

646
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,720
You're letting that
guy in the cockpit?

647
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,806
Here's what's gonna
happen. You're gonna
get back to your seat,

648
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,892
you're gonna sit down,
and you're gonna shut up.

649
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:16,977
Or what?

650
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,228
From one cop to another,

651
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,814
you know.

652
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,954
There was nothing I could do.

653
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:10,989
Excuse me, miss?
You were sitting next
to that guy, the marshal?

654
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,533
You know what's happening?

655
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:15,535
I have no idea.

656
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,332
DR. NASIR: There's no
evidence of assault.

657
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:24,461
It could be poison.
Induced anaphylaxis.

658
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,212
What?
Allergic reaction.

659
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,340
Without an autopsy, I...

660
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,551
Yeah.

661
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:32,802
Doctor, would you mind seeing

662
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:36,598
if any of
the passengers in coach
need medical assistance?

663
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:37,682
This...

664
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,144
This stays between
us. Please.

665
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,982
Nancy, go with him.

666
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:08,505
Kyle.

667
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:12,342
Kyle, did the captain
leave the cockpit since
I last spoke with him?

668
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,846
You?
No.

669
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,264
Did anyone else enter?

670
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:19,724
No.

671
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:24,020
Has he had anything
to eat or drink?

672
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:25,313
I don't think so.

673
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,650
Have you or the captain
had any reason to
unlock this door?

674
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:29,734
Of course not.

675
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:31,277
So you and he
were both alone here,

676
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:33,124
on the flight deck,
for the past 20 minutes?

677
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:34,948
You bastard.

678
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:36,116
Don't get emotional.

679
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,909
I'm getting emotional?
Look at you!

680
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,369
Rice, if you have
a problem with me...

681
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,037
I have a problem
with my friend
dying next to me.

682
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:42,706
I have a problem
with being accused

683
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:44,416
of not only murder,
but also hijacking.

684
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,834
I didn't accuse
you of hijacking.

685
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:49,170
Christ, I've heard
about you. About your
problems with money.

686
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,922
With drinking. TSA.

687
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,717
They gave a paranoid
alcoholic a gun and a badge

688
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,385
and they put him on my plane.

689
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,970
Brilliant.

690
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:58,847
You're gonna hit me?

691
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,266
Don't tell...
Hey! Hey! What
are you doing?

692
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,983
This door stays locked
until this plane
lands safely. Okay?

693
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:19,200
Marenick...
Marks, God damn it,
I thought I told you...

694
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,202
The captain's dead.

695
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:22,412
Excuse me?

696
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:25,623
The cockpit was secured,
locked from the inside.

697
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:28,084
Let me guess,
were you inside, Bill?

698
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,545
The co-pilot said
the man just
collapsed beside him.

699
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:34,382
It could be
induced anaphylaxis,
I think it's called.

700
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:36,426
Induced...
What are you talking about?

701
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,636
Poisoning, I don't know how.

702
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:43,099
It was just he
and the co-pilot,
and the co-pilot, I trust.

703
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:44,184
For now.

704
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,478
"For now"? I don't
know about this, Bill.

705
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,563
Marenick, you need
to transfer the money.

706
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:49,689
Where is Agent Hammond?

707
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,774
I need to corroborate
everything you're telling us.

708
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:53,359
Hammond's dead.

709
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,569
What?

710
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,446
He had cocaine
in his carry-on.
Jesus Christ!

711
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:57,851
I confronted him,
he pulled a gun.

712
00:51:57,907 --> 00:52:01,075
Are you serious?
Marenick. Transfer
the money.

713
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,327
Buy me time.
I'll find him.

714
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,578
Transfer the money.

715
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,122
$150 million into your account?

716
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:08,408
Is that something
you're seriously
asking me to do, Bill?

717
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,628
The moment we land,
arrest me, freeze the
funds. Just transfer it.

718
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,087
I can't do that, Bill.

719
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,652
The airline
believes paying the demand

720
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,553
will set a dangerous
and irreversible precedent.

721
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:18,718
Christ, there are 150
people on this plane.

722
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:20,720
Which makes me wonder
why you haven't
cut the network.

723
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:23,097
You have 150 people panicking,

724
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,601
contacting their families,
while we're trying to
handle the situation.

725
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,186
You attribute all
this to a passenger,

726
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,105
but you can give me no proof
he actually exists.

727
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,107
I won't cut the network.
I need to communicate
with this guy.

728
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,485
Then, Agent Marks,
I can't continue
talking to you.

729
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,569
What does that mean?

730
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:39,739
It means we will
not negotiate
with a terrorist.

731
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:45,245
Nancy.

732
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,255
Who else in the crew
has access to the cockpit?

733
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:51,501
Just me.

734
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:58,341
Would you like
to see my phone,
Agent Marks?

735
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,243
Is your
interview in
the morning?

736
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,786
Yeah.
If we ever
make it there.

737
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,371
Yeah, if we ever land, right?

738
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,789
Exactly. But
it shouldn't...

739
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:31,291
I'm sorry. I'll get up.

740
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,668
No. Please, don't worry
about it. Zack, this is Bill.

741
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:34,794
Bill, Zack.

742
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:37,046
We were just talking
and Zack was telling me

743
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,340
that he's
a programmer
for smart phones.

744
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:40,884
Is that right?

745
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,803
Yeah. I'm interviewing
at Paige in the morning

746
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,847
for a software
analytics position.

747
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,433
Which, technically,
isn't programming. But...

748
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:50,226
Look, I'm sorry for being
such an asshole earlier...

749
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,520
Yeah, but you were
a programmer, right?

750
00:53:52,605 --> 00:53:55,440
I was telling him that
I keep losing my phone,

751
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:56,566
and because I
keep my ringer off...

752
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,818
It'd be nice if there
was a way to find it.

753
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,779
Yeah, but apparently,
it's pretty simple, right?

754
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,907
I didn't say it was simple...
GPS?

755
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:05,325
Carrier signal triangulation?

756
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:06,784
No.

757
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:09,954
Basically, you just
send an intrusion virus
attached to a picture text

758
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,373
that switches the phone
from silent to ring.

759
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:15,084
Most phones load
images automatically,
so if you...

760
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,670
What if there's no
cell phone coverage?

761
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,256
If it's two phones
on a smaller network?

762
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,592
It's the same protocol.
Even over Wi-Fi.

763
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,969
How fast could you do
something like that?

764
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:26,763
What, like right now?

765
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:27,847
Yes.

766
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,349
There are variables.

767
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:30,475
The phone and the network.

768
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,477
If the other phone is
even turned on or not.

769
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:35,146
It's on. But the target
number is anonymous.

770
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,899
You have to send
it from this phone.

771
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:42,946
Jesus.

772
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,074
Marshal,
I don't know
about this.

773
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,241
Can you do it?

774
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:50,036
This dude is talking
about killing people.
Can he see us right now?

775
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,120
I'm here.

776
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:54,499
I guess I can give it a shot.
But I can't guarantee...

777
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:55,833
How fast?

778
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:57,293
Thirty minutes?

779
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,087
Twenty?

780
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,131
We have less than eight minutes.

781
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:05,551
You can do it.
That's why they want
to hire you, right?

782
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,595
Eight minutes.

783
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,472
Okay.

784
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,433
Tell me when it's ready.

785
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,018
Thanks, ma'am.

786
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,153
Hey, hey.

787
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,406
What did you see up there?

788
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,700
I'm really not
at liberty to say.

789
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,327
What, are you like
a doctor or something?

790
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,125
What the hell?

00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:40,378
BILL: Ladies and
gentlemen, if I can have
your attention.

792
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,672
The business
cabin is now closed.

793
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:47,760
I repeat, the business cabin
is now closed to everyone.

794
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:49,762
Flight attendants,
if you could do your best,

795
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,848
please, to
accommodate all passengers.

796
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:53,182
Thank you.

MAN: I have a family,
for Christ's sake!

799
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,943
We have a situation.

800
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,237
Hey, man, you gonna
tell us what the hell
is going on or not?

801
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,406
Is the captain all right or not?

802
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:12,994
The... The situation
is quite complicated.

803
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,245
Complicated? Come on!

804
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,580
But I can assure you...

805
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:16,789
This is bullshit!

806
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:17,999
Everything's in hand!

807
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,375
Everything is under control!

808
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,335
Everyone, calm down!

809
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,795
I want to see the captain.

810
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,630
I'm gonna head up there myself.

811
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,750
That's it.
Move aside, Marshal.

812
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,010
Wait, wait. Free travel.

813
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,387
Free flights!

Free travel.

815
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:35,183
The airline
company will guarantee

816
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,602
one year's
international free travel.

817
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:41,814
If you sit down, remain quiet,
and do what I say.

818
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:44,233
Free international travel.

819
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:45,943

Kyle, it's Bill.

825
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,081
Why are we turning?

826
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:01,160
I've been instructed
not to communicate
with you, Marks.

827
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:04,253
Did they tell you
to cut the network?
Listen to me.

828
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,466
The men who issued
those instructions
are not on this plane.

829
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:12,762
This is your plane.
These are your passengers.
Rice!

830
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:13,846
Kyle!

831
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:16,849
We've been diverted
north. 55 minutes.

832
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:18,893
Did they tell you
to cut the network?

833
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,353
I have orders, Marks.

834
00:57:20,938 --> 00:57:23,272
Give me five minutes.
Five minutes.

835
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,690
Land the plane
wherever you want,

836
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,234
but do not switch
that network off.

837
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:29,904
Do you hear me?
I have a plan.
I can find this guy.

838
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,405
Five minutes.

839
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,833
I hope we can trust this guy.

840
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,084
I trust him.

841
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:47,130
Yeah, well,
I'd rather not end up
an accessory to a hijacking.

842
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,340
Okay.
BILL: Zack.

843
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,634
It's done.
Here it is.

844
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:52,718
Good man.

845
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,758
You think the captain's
still in control of the plane?

846
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,307
The plane almost goes down,

847
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,852
there's a guy
waving his gun around,
tying people up.

848
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:02,728
I'd say he pretty
much took control.

849
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:07,024
So you think the thing
about free international
flights was bullshit, or...

850
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,821
At what point do
we do something?

851
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,824
Gentlemen,
would you please
return to your seats?

852
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,668
You don't know
what's going on
either, do you?

853
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,975
So, what's the air
marshal up to now?

00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:45,062
Ladies and gentlemen,

855
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,398
I need every passenger
to raise their
hands above their heads

856
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:49,650
and remain silent for
the next 60 seconds.

857
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,862
This is not a request.

858
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,034
Up.

859
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:01,120

I've never seen
that phone before.

868

Stand up, now.

869
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,293

872
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:36,299
Shut up.
Front of the plane. Move!

873
01:00:36,383 --> 01:00:37,883
You're making a mistake.

874
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,510

you're talking about!

or I will break your arm.

We got him.

then he takes another guy and
brings him out back.

pick us off one by one?

That's the doctor
right there. Hey.

know what's going on?

Dead.

Are you all right?
Me? Fine. I'm great.

You shouldn't be
seeing all this.

900
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:58,607
All right, Doc. So,
we got a dead passenger
and a dead pilot.

The plane took a hard
turn 15 minutes ago.

That doesn't
happen mid-flight.

903
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,948
The marshal closed
off business class,

904
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,325
moved all the passengers
to the back.

905
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,077
Does this scenario
ring any bells?

gonna crash the plane?

01:05:11,408 --> 01:05:12,616
Excuse me.

910
01:05:12,701 --> 01:05:14,243
I was told I could
stay here with my husband.

911
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:15,744
Of course.

912
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:18,414
You used the lavatory
about an hour ago.
Do you remember that?

913
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,457
I don't have Alzheimer's.

914
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:24,086
Do you know
if someone else went
in there after you?

915
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,132
Yes, she was standing there
blocking the aisle.

916
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,466
Who?

917
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:30,634
The redhead.

918
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:33,429
The woman you
were sitting next to.

919
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,151
What are you doing in here?

920
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:50,738
I'm drinking.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't.
That's just terrible.

921
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,364
I've been wondering.

922
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,452
Why the window seat?

923
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,495
What? Why the window seat?

924
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,831
Why did you sit next to me?

925
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,625
What?
I found a hole

926
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,878
in the first class toilet,
clear shot to the captain.

927
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:09,048
The guy who died
had one of these
imbedded in his skin.

928
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:11,592
Ever seen one before?

929
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,177
No.

930
01:06:13,261 --> 01:06:16,430
The toilets were
locked 10 minutes
before the captain died.

931
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,682
Five minutes before that,
I saw a woman enter.

932
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,143
She's 70 years old.

933
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,103
She said you went in after her,

934
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:26,857
and she doesn't
have Alzheimer's,
if you're wondering.

935
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,070
Are you asking me
if I saw someone
else go in,

936
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,738
or if I killed the captain?

937
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,783
Did you see someone else?

938
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,036
No.

939
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,663
Then answer the question.

940
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:43,666
You're a dick.

941
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:47,544
You switched seats
to be next to me,
which made you trustworthy.

942
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,171
You engaged me in conversation.

943
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:50,255
To relax you
because you were scared...

944
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,465
Yet you evaded
personal questions.

945
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:54,385
You mean, like where
I work. Yeah, that's
a great personal question.

946
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:55,886
You inserted yourself
into the investigation.

947
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,137
Are you serious?

948
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:58,597
Tracking the phone,
that was your idea.

949
01:06:58,682 --> 01:06:59,807
Are you kidding me?

950
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:02,351
I am the only
person on this plane
who has stood by you.

951
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,727
You've been lying to
me this entire time.

952
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:05,813
You've been lying to me
since the second you
boarded this plane.

953
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,482
Oh, God! Okay, fine, fine!

954
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,529
Seven years ago my heart failed,

955
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:16,198
and I was dead
for like 43 minutes.

956
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,033
Aortic arch aneurysm.

957
01:07:18,118 --> 01:07:20,202
They tried to fix it,
but when I woke up,

958
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,870
they told me
it was something
they couldn't fix

959
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:25,666
and that one day
it would fail again
and I would just die.

960
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:29,837
And that's okay with me
because we're all
gonna die someday,

961
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,381
and none of us
know when it's
gonna be, right?

962
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,426
But when I fly, which is a lot,

963
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,928
I like to look out
the window instead of

964
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,638
at the back of
the seat in front of me

965
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:42,266
or a folding tray table,
because one day
might be today.

966
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,439
Why do you like the aisle?

967
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,107
Dick.

968
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:58,407
Wait a second.

969
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,536
Here.

970
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:06,665
Let me pour you a real drink.

971
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,175
Thanks.

972
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:18,844
I'm sorry.

973
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:23,724
I hate flying.

974
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:26,602
Really?

975
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,104
I always kind of
liked it, you know?

976
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,690
Six hours in the same spot,
nobody can get to you.

977
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:34,276
Nothing to do but just
be present, you know?

978
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,028
You have no control.

979
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:39,615
Control is an illusion.
There is no control.

980
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,700
Over anything.

981
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,495
WOMAN:
You need to listen to this.

982
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:51,543
REPORTER: Where
a federal bomb squad and
investigators are searching

983
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:54,254
a car that allegedly
belongs to Bill Marks.

984
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:58,383
Sources tell us that Marks
parked his car here
at the airport today

985
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:01,220
before boarding
British Aqualantic Flight 10,

986
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,806
the way he had boarded
so many flights before,

987
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,141
in the guise of
an everyday passenger,

988
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:07,559
but carrying a mandate

989
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:10,395
from the United
States Department
of Homeland Security.

990
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,648
His job, to protect the flight.

991
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:16,485
And he was also, as always,
carrying a concealed handgun.

992
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:20,239
Well, we know this is
the hijacker's phone.
Can it tell us anything?

993
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,032
It's password protected.
I can't get in.

994
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,243
Did you try guessing?

995
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:36,797
This is a transatlantic flight
from New York to London,

996
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,216
the airline now
confirming this is,

997
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,844
in fact,
a hijacking in progress.

998
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:48,308
What did you do?
I didn't do anything,
I swear to God.

999
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:50,811
I just was
messing around with it.
I didn't do anything.

1000
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:08,245
Open every bag in this cabin.

1001
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,874
And the horrific
twist is that the hijacker

1002
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,667
is now believed to
be the one person who

1003
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,553
was authorized to
carry a gun onto the plane.

1004
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,797
You're looking for a package.
You'll know if you find it.

1005
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,757
Every bag. Go! Now!
Okay.

1006
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:22,384
Marenick.

1007
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:23,927
Marks?
Order this plane
down to 8,000 feet.

1008
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:25,262
Marks, listen to me.

1009
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:26,847
I have reason to believe
there's a bomb on the plane.

1010
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:29,016
Agent Marks,
just listen to me.
We need to drop altitude now.

1011
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,060
A bomb at this height
would tear this plane apart.

1012
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:33,103
REPORTER: and questions
already swirling around

1013
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,147
Bill Marks and his state of mind

1014
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,607
as he boarded the flight...

1015
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:39,067
MARENICK: Bill, when you send
me a text and you say

1016
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,278
that you're out of options,
you and I both know
that's not the case.

1017
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:43,113
Who else received that message?

1018
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,865
Clearly, we got it here at TSA.

1019
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,869
We're getting
calls from the FBI,
the White House,

1020
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,410
and now the press is involved.

1021
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,872
You have our attention.
There's no need to take
this any further, Bill.

1022
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:55,500
No one else has to die.
I know it feels like no one
is listening, but I am.

1023
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:56,668
We'll work it out together.

1024
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,211
Marenick,
you're not getting this!

1025
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:00,839
Bill, listen to me.
Let's talk this through.

1026
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:02,633
You're talking to me
like I'm a terrorist.

1027
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:03,759
You know how this works.

1028
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:06,428
If you try to bring that
plane any lower into
civilian airspace,

1029
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:07,930
you will be shot down.

1030
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,514
You're a threat to ground, Bill.

1031
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,202
Just wait for your
money and sit tight.

1032
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:14,937
REPORTER: A stark picture
of a man in a dangerous
psychological state.

1033
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,357
MARENICK: Bill, stay with me.
I need you to
cooperate with us...

1034
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,192
What now?

1035
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,714
REPORTER: Officials say
he was originally
from Northern Ireland.

1036
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,613
He became
a decorated New York City

1037
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:26,615
police officer
with a young family.

1038
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,493
He became distraught
when his 8-year-old
daughter, Olivia,

1039
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:31,203
passed away from cancer.

1040
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,081
Over the next decade,
sources say he
became withdrawn,

1041
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,249
got divorced in 2003.

1042
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:38,835
Suspended and later
fired from the NYPD,

1043
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,004
it was then,
in the summer of 2003,

1044
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:44,508
that he transferred
to the Federal
Air Marshal Service.

1045
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,510
And there,
his colleagues and neighbors

1046
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:49,221
saying he's a quiet man
who kept mostly to himself.

1047
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,515
MALE REPORTER: This is
a costly program, as well.

1048
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:54,309
There's no question.
This is what happens
when you put an unstable,

1049
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:56,019
angry man in
a position of power.

1050
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:57,604
This guy wasn't
even born in the U.S.

1051
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,231
He could be IRA,
for all we know.

1052
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,315
Thank you.

1053
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,527
Since 9/11,
we've put 4,000 air
marshals in the sky.

1054
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,070
Where do these people come from?

1055
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,697
I've seen these guys myself.

1056
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:08,782
They walk right
past the security line

1057
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,909
and they're barely
qualified to carry a badge.

1058
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:12,911
Walked right past security.

1059
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:15,122
There's controversy
around the air marshal
program already.

1060
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:16,873
Is this the final blow?

1061
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:19,710
We give these people
absolute power in the sky.

1062
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:21,514
We give them guns
and we put them on planes,

1063
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:25,632
and we're surprised
when we have incidences
of drug smuggling.

1064
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,004
Oh, God.

1065
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:19,644
Now!

1066
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:21,938
Go, go, go!

1067
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,068
Grab him!
Grab him! Get the gun!

1068
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:27,986
Help me, man!
Wait!

1069
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,613
Hey, stop it!

1070
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:31,740
Stop it!
No, no, no, no.

1071
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:32,908
Stay down!

1072

(SCREAMING)

1080
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,279
Get him to the ground!
Hold him steady!

1081
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:12,364
Get his legs!

1082
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:13,740
Hold him, God damn it!

Grab his legs!
BILL: Listen to me!

1084
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:16,618
Listen to me!
Shut up!

1085
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,079
Listen to me, please!
Please, go into the bathroom!

1086
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,372
Pin him down!
In the bathroom!

1087
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,165
You're done, Marshal!
There's a dead body!

1088
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,290
Shut the hell up! Shut up!

1089
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:24,417
There's a dead
body and a briefcase!

1090
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:25,752
In the briefcase
you'll find a bomb!

1091
01:14:25,837 --> 01:14:27,129
Bullshit, you're lying!

1092
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:28,588
There is a bomb on this plane.

1093
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:32,008
Believe me, please!

1094
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:35,262
Get off of him.

1095
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:38,014
I said get off of him!
Get off him!
(ALL GASPING)

1096
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:40,475
Do it now. Get back, back!

01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:43,270
Back away, all of you.

1098

No, stay where you are.

I'm NYPD, we got it covered!

01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,576
Is there a bomb on this plane?

1104
01:15:05,251 --> 01:15:07,169
I want you to tell me
what the hell is going on.

1105
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:09,421
Relax.
Don't tell me to relax!

1106
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:13,383
A passenger on
board this flight has

1107
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,052
threatened to kill
someone every 20 minutes

1108
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:19,764
unless they're
paid $150 million.

1109
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:23,185
And now, three people are dead.

1110
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,938
The bomb will explode
in less than half an hour.

1111
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,942
Now, they want you to believe
that I'm responsible.

1112
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,529
Everything you've
heard about me is true.

1113
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:38,617
I've lost my family, my job.
I'm an alcoholic.

1114
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:43,622
My daughter was diagnosed
with acute leukemia
at the age of five,

1115
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:48,043
and I spent my days at work
instead of being at home,

1116
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:52,172
looking after her,
because I was afraid
of watching her die!

1117
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,094
I'm not a good father.
I'm not a good man.

1118
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,725
I'm not hijacking this plane.

1119
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:05,852
I'm trying to save it!

1120
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:11,524
And I will save it!
If you work with me.

1121
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:23,745
You're NYPD. So was I,

1122
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,248
and you look as if you were
a better officer than I was.

1123
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:27,999
Cut him loose. Nancy.

1124
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:41,554
We need to start moving
all the luggage
towards the back.

1125
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:42,879
And move the women and children,

1126
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,410
move them up to
the front of the plane.

1127
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:46,142
That's your plan?

1128
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:48,687
My job is to prepare
for the worst
possible outcome.

1129
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,522
Well, my job is to prevent it.

1130
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,358
Women and children,
no exceptions.
Men move up in coach.

1131
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:57,894
What the hell are you thinking?

1132
01:16:57,905 --> 01:17:00,115
There's a plan of
action that exists

1133
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:03,535
called the Least Resistant
Bomb Location Protocol.

1134
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,620
You place the bomb
against the rear door

1135
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:07,580
and stack anything and
everything against it.

1136
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:12,043
Every bag,
blanket, every pillow.
Nullify it as best you can.

1137
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:14,838
At this height
a bomb would tear
this plane apart,

1138
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:19,301
but we descend
to 8,000 feet,
pressure equalizes,

1139
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:20,969
and then we have a chance.

1140
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:24,806
So you're just gonna
let the bomb go off?

1141
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,559
Of course not,
I'm gonna stop it.

1142
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,312
But if I can't,
I'd rather be prepared,
wouldn't you?

1143
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,399
The man who brought this
bomb on the plane
may try something.

1144
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:36,276
Can I trust you to stop him?

1145
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,784
You're damn straight you can.

1146
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:48,413
Hey, Reilly, sorry
about the nose.

1147
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:51,583
It was never my best feature.

1148
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:55,795
Can't you get them
to wire the money?
Just try something?

1149
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,213
This was never about the money.

1150
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:58,757
Then what's it about?

1151
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:02,761
I'm not sure.
They used an
account in my name.

1152
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,430
They want an air marshal
to take down a plane

1153
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,016
with 150 people on board,

1154
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,852
and they want
the whole world
to see it.

1155
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:14,189
I was never
supposed to find
that bomb.

1156
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:24,491
WOMAN: Look.

1157
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:28,244
That's not good.

1158
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:30,038
WOMAN: Do you know
what that means?

1159
01:18:34,293 --> 01:18:36,878
Aqualantic Flight 10,
this is Royal Air Force 114,

1160
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:39,589
call sign Jackrabbit.
How copy?

1161
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:41,466
Copy, Jackrabbit.

1162
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,177
We will be your
escorts to the
designated landing zone.

1163
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:45,970
Do not deviate from
your current course

1164
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,889
or altitude
without authorization.

1165
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:50,141
Do you copy?
Copy.

1166
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:52,685
Kyle.

1167
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:55,397
Kyle.
Yes, Marks?

1168
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:56,481
We have a new situation.

1169
01:18:56,524 --> 01:18:58,358
Yeah, no shit.

1170
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:00,735
I need you to drop
the plane to 8,000 feet.

1171
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,029
Get to the lowest
pressure deferential
you can.

1172
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:04,781
One PSI, 1.5 at most.

1173
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,325
Wait, Bill,
that's explosives protocol.

1174
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:11,413
Yes, we have 16 minutes,
give or take.

1175
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:13,498
You know we have company, right?

1176
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,084
Two typhoons are
flanking me right now.

1177
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,086
They're watching,
and you want me to...

1178
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,755
Kyle, we need to
drop altitude now.

1179
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,175
Look, I have orders, Marks.
Any suspicious
activity and they...

1180
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,593
Rice!

1181
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:29,097
There is a bomb on this
plane. We have to
descend to 8,000 feet.

1182
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:32,809
All right, give me 10 minutes.
If we drop now, I lose speed.

1183
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:35,645
Ten minutes at this
altitude, maybe I can get
us close enough,

1184
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,397
close enough to land in Iceland.

1185
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:38,982
Ten minutes. Thanks.

1186
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:12,974
It's an RDX explosive.
Very professional.
Maybe military.

1187
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:14,058
Is that blow?

1188
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:17,729
Are you positive it
can't be disarmed?

1189
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:20,231
This is
a calibrated
pressure trigger.

1190
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:22,984
The only way to disarm a bomb
is to remove the trigger.

1191
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:27,655
But remove the trigger,
the pressure releases,
the bomb goes off.

1192
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:29,860
Well, can't we
just dump it?
Same principle in reverse.

1193
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:31,701
The low pressure
outside the plane

1194
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,587
won't hold the trigger.
You try to dump it...

1195
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:34,621
The bomb goes off.

1196
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,831
Isn't there like
a wire you can cut?
No.

1197
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:38,396
So, if this guy
doesn't get his money,

1198
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:39,959
he's gonna kill
himself and everyone aboard?

1199
01:20:40,044 --> 01:20:41,544
I can't believe this.
This is crazy.

1200
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,546
Why aren't we
looking for this guy?
We're out of time.

1201
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:45,256
That's a bullshit answer,
Marshal, you know it.

1202
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,466
Take it easy.

1203
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:49,093
There's 150 passengers
and crew.
It could be anyone.

1204
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,846
Let's find him!
Let's pay him,
let's do something.

1205
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:54,766
It's not about the money,
and even if I find him...

1206
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,436
I don't think
he ever intended to
get off this plane.

1207
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,939
My God, we're all gonna die.

1208
01:21:04,235 --> 01:21:05,318
No!

1209
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:10,365
We gotta place the bomb
here. Stack all available
luggage over it.

1210
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,033
And direct
the explosion outward.

1211
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:15,328
At 8,000 feet,
the pressure will
equalize. Then we land.

1212
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:17,997
With a hole in the fuselage?
And this has worked before?

1213
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:20,917
It's never been tried before.

1214
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,835
That you know of.
You're not being
helpful, Doctor.

1215
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,003
We're so screwed.

1216
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,213
It could work!
We've got to try!

1217
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:28,341
Come on! Grab every able hand!
Let's get this done!

1218
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:33,054
Marshal, if they're
setting this thing off,
no matter what,

1219
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:35,848
what are they waiting for?

1220
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:39,310
AUSTIN: Just grab
what you can, go to the back.

1221
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:40,728
All right,
you guys form a chain,

1222
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:43,314
send those bags back
as fast as you can.

1223
01:21:45,943 --> 01:21:48,945
ATTENDANT: Please
remove all luggage
from the overhead bins.

1224
01:21:56,954 --> 01:22:00,498
Kyle, how close are we?
We need to descend, now!

1225
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,417
No, give me three minutes.

1226
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,211
Three minutes, okay.

1227
01:22:05,296 --> 01:22:08,798
Look at your watch.
Three minutes from now,
not a second longer.

1228
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:11,759
No matter what happens,
drop down 8,000 feet.

1229
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:13,261
Okay.

1230
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,555
Take this.
MAN: Lighter luggage up front.

1231
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:18,725
Keep piling please.
Bring the heavier
luggage down.

1232
01:22:18,809 --> 01:22:19,851
NANCY: Keep them going.

1233
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,374
Sir, keep that with you,
I just need...

1234
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:24,397
Your nose.

1235
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,232
Yeah, it's bleeding, thanks.

1236
01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:28,234
You have a displaced fracture.

1237
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:31,195
Look, it's a broken nose,
it's normal,
I don't need you to fix it.

1238
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,823
Look, I'm going
to set your nose.

1239
01:22:34,325 --> 01:22:35,742
Here, hold this.

1240
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:36,868
Just make it quick, all right?

1241
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,161
Apply some pressure.

1242
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:39,871
Okay.

1243
01:22:40,748 --> 01:22:42,415
On three. One...

1244
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:44,417
(GRUNTING)

1245
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,843
GWEN: Sweetheart,
you've got to come out.

1246
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:56,304
It's all right,
I'll hold your hand.
But it's not safe.

1247
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:57,889
Gwen, what's going on?
Please.

1248
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,265
We need to hurry.

1249
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:02,977
Sorry.
I'm sorry, I need your help.
She won't come out.

1250
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:06,064
What's wrong?
Are you scared?

1251
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:08,941
I wanna see my daddy.

1252
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:11,569
I know you do,
sweetheart.
I know you do.

1253
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:15,907
You know, I was a daddy
once to a little
girl just like you,

1254
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:18,785
and when she was scared,
you know what she'd do?

1255
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:23,039
She had a magic ribbon,
very powerful.

1256
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:26,376
It'll protect you,
just like your daddy.

1257
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:30,004
You wanna see it?
I have it in my pocket.

1258
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:33,299
I carry it all the time.
Here it is. Here.

1259
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:36,427
You wrap it around
your hand, just like that.

1260
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,596
That's it, hold on to it now.

1261
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,225
Are you bribing me?

1262
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:46,145
Yes, I am.

1263
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:52,318
This is my friend, Jen.
She's gonna look after you.

1264
01:23:52,403 --> 01:23:53,778
Jen, this is Becca.
Hey.

1265
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,447
Don't worry,
you'll see your father
soon. I promise.

1266
01:23:58,283 --> 01:23:59,617
Can I have the window seat?

1267
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:04,622
You mean this old seat?
Mm-hm.

1268
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,547
KYLE: Ladies and
gentlemen, we're about to
begin our descent.

1269
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:16,134
I need you to
return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

1270
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,720
GWEN: Please stay calm.
Everyone, please get
back to your seats.

1271
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:20,805
(PHONE RINGING)

1272
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:21,889
Yeah?

1273
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:23,474
MARENICK: Marks,
we transferred the money,

1274
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,101
150 million US
into your account.

1275
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:27,228
It's too late for the money.
Whatever he's doing...

1276
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,689
You can stop now, Marks.
You have your money.

1277
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:30,894
The jets will escort you in.

1278
01:24:30,941 --> 01:24:32,742
I have to bring this
plane down to 8,000 feet.

1279
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:35,069
You will not descend
into civilian airspace.

1280
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:38,698
You think he wants the money?
You think that will stop him?

1281
01:24:38,782 --> 01:24:40,950
If you transferred
the money, prove it.

1282
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:44,704
You want proof?
Here's your proof,
$150 million was transferred

1283
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:51,085
to account
CH-1000-23000-A-10982.

1284
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:54,630
Confirmation code R48940.

1285
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,968
We'll escort you into
a military air field,

1286
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:01,596
you will not be arrested,
no questions will be asked.

1287
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,849
There is a bomb on this plane.
It isn't mine. It will go off!

1288
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:07,769
And we have to prepare...
You're in command
of a hijacked vessel

1289
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,437
and you will not
dive that plane
into civilian airspace.

1290
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,521
I will!

1291
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,273
Then, Marks, God damn it,
we will shoot you down!

1292
01:25:12,357 --> 01:25:15,777
Someday, they'll fish
this plane's black box
out of the Atlantic Ocean,

1293
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:17,779
and the world will
know these people
could have been saved.

1294
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:19,383
The world already
knows what's going on

1295
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:20,865
in that plane, Bill.
You are hijacking it.

1296
01:25:20,908 --> 01:25:22,366
That's what
you're telling them.
No, no, no, no, no.

1297
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:24,131
That's what your
hostages are telling them.

1298
01:25:24,203 --> 01:25:27,330
That video is playing on
every major news
network on repeat, Bill.

1299
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:30,249
What video?
One of your
hostages uploaded a video.

1300
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:32,752
You're taking a man,
dragging him
around at gunpoint,

1301
01:25:32,836 --> 01:25:34,754
stumbling over
terrified passengers.

1302
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:37,298
How do you expect
us to believe anything
that you're saying

1303
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,383
when you clearly
are abusing those hostages?

1304
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,093
We've seen everything
we need to know.

1305
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,887
But we're trying to negotiate...

1306
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:51,312
Your phone, now! The phone!

1307
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:53,231
Show me the video
that you uploaded!
Come on!

1308
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:00,655
I apologize for my son.

1309
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:05,618
Humor me. Look!

1310
01:26:06,954 --> 01:26:08,538
Look.
I don't see him.

1311
01:26:08,622 --> 01:26:09,664
Come on, look.

1312
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:13,626
Right there.
Where?

1313
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:15,461
Glasses.
Come on, move.

1314
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,214
God damn it!

1315
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:20,925
You. Look...

1316
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,434
God damn it!

1317
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,743
Stay where you are.

1318
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:49,829
Bill, don't test me!

1319
01:26:54,668 --> 01:26:56,294
Bill.

1320
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:58,546
Reilly, drop!

1321
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,174
Reilly, get down!

1322
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:04,135
You gave me an unloaded weapon?

1323
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:05,887
Overhead bin, 4B!

1324
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:08,764
Everybody, down! Stay down!

1325
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:14,604
Hey, get out of there, move!
What?

1326
01:27:14,897 --> 01:27:16,480
Hey, man!

1327
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:24,322
You looking for this?

1328
01:27:25,782 --> 01:27:26,949
Give me that.

1329
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:29,577
What are you doing?

1330
01:27:42,716 --> 01:27:44,091
Get back!
Okay, okay.

1331
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:46,857
Jackrabbit,
I have shots fired outside
this cockpit, need to descend.

1332
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:50,973
That's a negative, Flight 10,
do not deviate from your
current course or altitude.

1333
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:55,853
Turn around.

1334
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:57,716
I need all of you
to put your hands

1335
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,065
on the seat-back
in front of you.

1336
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:00,733
Do it now!

1337
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,152
Move.
Don't test me.

1338
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:04,862
Step back!

1339
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:06,781
Put your hands up!

1340
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:07,990
Sit!

1341
01:28:08,075 --> 01:28:09,659
Sit, sit!

1342
01:28:12,329 --> 01:28:14,205
He was supposed to be
in the seat next to mine.

1343
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,123
Yeah. He was close enough.

1344
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:21,379
Listen,
whatever I've done to you,
whatever it is, I'm sorry.

1345
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,172
Stay down!

1346
01:28:23,382 --> 01:28:25,591
Bill, I'm not mad at you.

1347
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:27,551
You're my hero.

1348
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:30,596
People everywhere
are gonna remember
the name Bill Marks.

1349
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:32,682
An alcoholic,
self-destructive,

1350
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:34,809
suicidal man with
a gun and a federal badge

1351
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:35,935
who changed everything.

1352
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:37,853
What do you think doing
this is gonna change?

1353
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:40,106
Two minutes outside
the window. Suit up.

1354
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:41,910
Every one of these
people boarded this plane

1355
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:43,776
believing their
country would protect them.

1356
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,236
That you would protect them.

1357
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:50,157
Everyone!

1358
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:51,575
We're gonna be okay!

1359
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:53,619
There's an air marshal on board.

1360
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,498
Do you have any
idea how easy this was?

1361
01:28:57,749 --> 01:29:00,167
You're right, I failed.
You've made your point.

1362
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,712
No, Bill, you failed miserably!

1363
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:07,341
Three thousand
people died that day,
including my father!

1364
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:10,761
So I joined up
'cause I wanted to go
fight the cowards that did it.

1365
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:14,265
But I just ended
up fighting in a war
that I still don't understand

1366
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:17,018
and came home to a country
where nothing had changed.

1367
01:29:17,853 --> 01:29:18,894
Until now.

1368
01:29:19,438 --> 01:29:22,106
Security is this
country's biggest lie.

1369
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:26,944
In our homes, in our cities,
in our planes, no one's safe,

1370
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:30,781
and one day
somebody worse than me
is gonna expose that lie,

1371
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:32,616
and the last thing
our children will see

1372
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:34,577
is our failure as
it destroys them.

1373
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:39,248
You, Bill, you are that lie!

1374
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,098
You should just have
handed out pamphlets.

1375
01:29:41,168 --> 01:29:42,710
It would have been a lot easier.

1376
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:48,716
You can't change
the world with words, Bill,

1377
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,926
unless you write those
words in the evening
news with blood.

1378
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:52,053
We gotta go.

1379
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:55,598
You're military.
These are the people
you fought to protect.

1380
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:58,934
I swore to protect my country,
and that's what I'm doing.

1381
01:29:59,019 --> 01:30:00,728
You believe that?
I do.

1382
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:03,522
I also believe we'll
be $150 million richer.

1383
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:06,067
You'll never get that money.
It's in an account in my name.

1384
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:07,902
It's in a trust in your name.

1385
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,072
I die, the money moves.

1386
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:14,909
To 100 accounts,
27 countries, each of
those into 100 other accounts.

1387
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:17,078
When do you think
you're gonna jump?

1388
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:19,246
35,000 feet? You'll be
dead in four seconds.

1389
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:21,707
We'll jump when the pilot
follows explosive protocol

1390
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:24,001
and drops us down to 8,000 feet.

1391
01:30:24,336 --> 01:30:26,670
Anything you think of,
we've thought of
a thousand times.

1392
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:29,590
They've been instructed
to shoot us down
if we try to descend.

1393
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,092
That's bullshit!

1394
01:30:31,176 --> 01:30:33,135
They're not gonna
kill all these people.

1395
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:37,139
This is a hijacked flight.
We're a classified
threat to ground.

1396
01:30:38,058 --> 01:30:41,685
If you don't disarm that bomb,
everyone on board
will die, including you.

1397
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:43,354
Did you think of that?

1398
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:46,107
Look, I'm prepared to die.
We're not gonna die.

1399
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:48,859
Say again, Jackrabbit.
I need to descend.

1400
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:50,111
That's a negative, Flight 10.

1401
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:53,197
I'm gonna stick with the plan.
We descend, we jump.

1402
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,740
The plane goes down,
we have enough money.

1403
01:30:54,825 --> 01:30:56,117
We can do whatever we want.

1404
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,453
Think about it, Tommy.
We can disappear
and never come back.

1405
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:03,749
You hear me?
Never be found, ever.
Mission accomplished, right?

1406
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:06,374
But right now
we need to get
the hell off this plane.

1407
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:10,047
Zack, you and I both know
we were never
getting off this plane.

1408
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:15,761
Zack, whatever your name is,
you don't have to die.

1409
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:18,556
If you won't save these
people, save yourself.

1410
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:20,558
Disarm the bomb.

1411
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:23,936
Come on, do it.

1412
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:43,414
He was a martyr,
like you and me, Bill.

1413
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:46,834
Real heroes don't
need to be remembered
or recognized.

1414
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:48,878
Real heroes do
whatever's necessary.

1415
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:50,713
I guess I wouldn't understand.

1416
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:53,549
Fuck it!
I guess you wouldn't.

1417
01:32:17,324 --> 01:32:18,449
No!

1418
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,585
20,000! Come on, you wanker!

1419
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:57,529
8,000 feet! Come on, come on!

1420
01:32:59,824 --> 01:33:01,200
Bill!

1421
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:18,092
8,000!

1422
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:42,574
JACKRABBIT: AQ 10,
climb back up to 25,000 feet!
There's a bomb on board!

1423
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:44,179
I need to get this
plane on the ground.

1424
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:51,792
Nancy, move, move!
Everybody down, heads down!

1425
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:54,295
Hey, Bill!

1426
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:55,879
I'm getting off this plane!

1427
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:58,716
Am I in your way, asshole?

1428
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:21,822
Get down!

1429
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:24,074
Do it quick! Heads down!

1430
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:31,999
Get down!

1431
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:44,595
Come on, Kyle!
You can do this!
You can do this, come on.

1432
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:52,811
JACKRABBIT: severe
damage to your fuselage.

1433
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:54,313
Are you able to
maintain control?

1434
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:02,237
Shit!

1435
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:08,744
KYLE: Fuel dump in progress.

1436
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:11,246
Copy that, Flight 10.
Come on, damn it!

1437
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,541
A little longer, come on!

1438
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:32,393
Oh, God!

1439
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:38,440
Get the belt! Get the belt!

1440
01:35:42,112 --> 01:35:44,154
Hang on!
Bill, help me!

1441
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:46,156
Becca, I have you!

1442
01:35:46,783 --> 01:35:48,826
Hang onto me! Hang onto me!

1443
01:36:06,845 --> 01:36:08,554
You okay? Are you okay?

1444
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,685
Door is disarmed.
Release your seatbelts!

1445
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,772
Take her. Everybody.
Come on with me.

1446
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:21,233
Undo your seatbelt!
Move to the front, quickly.

1447
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:23,694
Leave everything.
Come this way,
up to the front.

1448
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:26,280
One at a time, please.

1449
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:28,198
Leave everything.

1450
01:36:28,658 --> 01:36:30,451
(SIRENS WAILING)

1451
01:36:31,453 --> 01:36:32,786
Leave everything.

1452
01:36:32,871 --> 01:36:33,912
Up to the front.

1453
01:36:34,873 --> 01:36:35,998
Leave everything.

1454
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:16,330
All passengers and
crew accounted for.

1455
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,624
And you, are you all right?

1456
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:20,709
That was a hell of a landing.

1457
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:29,301
REPORTER: Less than
one hour ago, British
Aqualantic Flight 10

1458
01:37:29,385 --> 01:37:32,930
made an emergency landing
after a bomb exploded mid-air.

1459
01:37:33,765 --> 01:37:37,684
This following
an attempted hijacking,
yet in an unbelievable twist,

1460
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:40,771
the suspected hijacker,
U.S. Air Marshal Bill Marks,

1461
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,564
turned out to be the hero.

1462
01:37:42,649 --> 01:37:45,984
It was Marks
who confronted and
killed the hijackers,

1463
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:48,070
saving the lives...

1464
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:50,822
Yeah?
It's Marenick.

1465
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:53,951
It's my turn to break
protocol, Agent Marks.

1466
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,440
I'm calling from
my personal line

1467
01:37:55,495 --> 01:37:57,871
and I'll deny this
conversation ever took place.

1468
01:37:57,956 --> 01:38:02,668
Listen, Bill,
what you did on that plane,
what you were up against,

1469
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:05,671
I want you to know
I was wrong about you.

1470
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:09,341
And you'll have my full support.

1471
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:12,344
Appreciate that.

1472
01:38:13,263 --> 01:38:14,805
And, Bill,

1473
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:16,974
we're gonna need
that money back.

1474
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:20,269
What money?

1475
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:23,564
Take care, Agent Marks.

1476
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:39,746
AUSTIN: Marshal!

1477
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:44,626
Reilly, you son of a gun.

1478
01:38:44,711 --> 01:38:46,420
Next time,
give me a loaded weapon.

1479
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:48,171
Next time, don't get shot.

1480
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:49,840
Deal.

1481
01:38:58,349 --> 01:38:59,749
I'm gonna give you
back your ribbon.

1482
01:39:01,102 --> 01:39:02,311
I don't need it anymore.

1483
01:39:04,522 --> 01:39:05,856
That-a-girl.

1484
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:08,358
It's your dad.

1485
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:12,946
Daddy.

1486
01:39:25,376 --> 01:39:27,794
Hey, I was looking for you!
Hey.

1487
01:39:29,255 --> 01:39:31,423
Do you know where we are?
Iceland.

1488
01:39:31,507 --> 01:39:34,009
Ah! Well,
never been to Iceland.

1489
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:37,804
I mean, I've seen it,
few times from
plane windows, but...

1490
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:39,097
Thank you.

1491
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:41,224
For what?

1492
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:44,394
You stood by me,
even after all
that happened.

1493
01:39:45,521 --> 01:39:46,521
Why?

1494
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:47,898
You're a good man.

1495
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:50,901
I bet your daughter
would have been proud of you.

1496
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:53,528
Thanks, ma'am.

1497
01:40:00,495 --> 01:40:01,495
So...

1498
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:02,579
Mm-hm.

1499
01:40:03,539 --> 01:40:04,748
Where you headed?

1500
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:09,795
Depends.
