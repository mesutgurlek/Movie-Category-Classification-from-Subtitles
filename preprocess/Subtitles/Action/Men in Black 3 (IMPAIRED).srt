Hey. Hey. Slop. Sup it.

600

When you're moving fast enough,

601
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,876
that circle is gonna fill up with
some sort of green lime-travel liquid

602

At this height,
that should be, uh...

Let's see, mass of Earth and
30-something feet per minute...

It's 32 feet per second, per second!

That sounds right-ish.

609
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:59,272
So that would be, I guess, uh,
about two feet off the ground.

610
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,738
I break the laser line?

No, don't break it!

612
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,012
No, when I'm fast enough!
Sounds good!

00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:07,115
Do I break the laser line
or do I not break the laser line?
