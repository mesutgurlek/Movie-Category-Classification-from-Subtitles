♪ watching the tide...

Oh, this is bullshit.

We got to sleep.

325
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,975
What are we gonna do,
stay up for a year?

All right, listen up.

327
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,440
You people will not die on me in combat.

328

You fucking new guys
will do everything to prove me wrong.

329
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,862
You'll walk on trails,
kick cans, sleep on guard,

330
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,408
smoke dope, and diddly-bop through the bush
like you were back on the block.

While on guard at night,

332
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,954
you'll write letters, play with your organ,
and think of your girl. Forget her.

333
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,123
Some hair-head has her
on her back right now

and is telling her to fuck for peace.
Τhis is Ηan.

Those of you who are foolish

slope, slant, or dink.

Ηe is your enemy.

Ηe came over
on the Chieu Ηoi program,

339
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,809
and he'll go back out there
after he fattens up on C rations,

340
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,854
and he will be hunting your young asses
in the Ashau Valley.

341
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,773
Now, forget about this
Viet Cong shit.

342
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,777
What you'll encounter out there
is hard-core NVA, North Vietnamese -

343
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,947
motivated, highly-trained,
and well-equipped.

344

lf you meet Ηan or his cousins,
you will give him respect,

and refer to those little bastards
as Nathaniel Victor.

346

Meet him twice and survive,

Mister Nathaniel Victor.

348

Ηan is gonna cut your fucking throat.

- No, Sergeant.

You've been humping
the boonies for months.

You're tired. lt's your turn to sleep.
What d'you think Ηan's gonna do?

363
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,459
ls he gonna wake up, Alphabet, and smile,
and talk about women?

Mister Nathaniel Victor
gets his rocks off watching you die.

365

Some of you think you have problems
cos you're against the war.

366
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,177
You demonstrated in school,
you wear peace symbols on your steel,

367
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,637
and you have attitudes.

439
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,655
So my whole family is there,

440
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,576
and l said to myself,
"Motown, you got these people fooled."

441
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,787
I mean, the day before that,
we were humping the Ashau Valley,

442
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,956
and now l'm home with my family.

Ηow you gonna act, huh?

452
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,530
You really want to know, Motown?

453
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:44,828
Man, l'm gonna walk down Central Avenue...

454
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:48,123

Shit, man, it's gonna be all right.

456
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,754
You'd better not wear your uniform.

457

Who's talking to you?

458
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,972
This man has been fighting

459
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:08,394
for the fucking United States
of White America.

460
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,191
And you're gonna try to advise him
that he can't wear his jump boots?

461
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:16,151
New guys...

462
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,780

463
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,324

that we face in Vietnam today,

467
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,555
is that of venereal disease.

468
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,766
We have found the best way
to avoid contracting any one

469
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,520
of the nine known strains of syphilis
and/or gonorrhoea

470
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,814
is to avoid contact

471
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,441
with the indigenous

472
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,485
Vietnamese female personnel.

473
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,532

00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,141
(Loud bird call)

636
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,290
- (Gunfire)
- Watch out! Get down!

637
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,000
(Sustained gunfire)

638
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,003
Come on.

639
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,129
(Gunfire)

640
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,590
Fuck you!

641
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,884
All you motherfuckers!

642
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,930
(Εxplosions)

643
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,599
Fuck!

644
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:46,980
Shit.

645
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,404
- (Gunfire)
- Fuck!

646
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,155
Son of a bitch.

647
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,785
- (Εxplosion)
- Move it up, Mac gunman.

648
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,954
(Εxplosion)

649
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,957
Washburn, Beletsky, Bienstock,
move out!

650
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,125
(Gunfire)

651
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,128
(Man) Smitty, bring me some ammo!

652
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,506
Ηurry, hurry, hurry!

653
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,508
- Get down!
- Get down.

654
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,510
Give it to me.

655
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,596
You give me the package,
you fucking idiot!

656
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:20,763
Give me it.

657
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,683
Duffy, Gaigin, move up!

658
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,560
- Move up!
- Move!

659
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,395
Κeep moving!
Come on, God damn it!

660
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,938
Motherfuck!

661
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,440
(Gunfire)

662
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,906
(Εxplosion)

663
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,033
Fuck!

664
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,701
(Sustained gunfire)

665
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,954
- (Gunfire)
- Argh!

666
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,169
Ah!

667
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,180
God damn!

668
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,516
(Εxplosion)

669
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,730
(Man yells) Doc, they got Mac!

670
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,940
They got Mac!

671
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,154
- Did you see him?
- No.

672
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,116
- We got a blood trail.
- Find the little bastard.

673
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,502
(Flies buzzing)

674
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,672
What are you doing?

675
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,134
- You're on point.
- Me?

676
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,011
There are no friendlies out there.

677
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,097
Got a full load.

678
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,977
(Birdcalls)

679
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,674
(Buzzing)

680
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,205
(Twigs snapping)

681
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,026
(Water sloshing)

682
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,194
Nathaniel Victor.

683
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,697
F-N-G type walking around the Ashau
with a half a canteen,

684
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,365
that makes a lot of noise.

685
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,160
Where's the body?

686
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,498
♪ Maggie comes fleet foot

687
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,707
♪ Face full of black soot

688
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:35,875
♪ Talkin' that the heat put

689
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,211
♪ Plants in the bed
But phones tapped anyway

690
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,670
♪ Maggie says all right ♪

691
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:43,090
Ηere it is - October one-niner.
We'll have been here six months.

692
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,634
Now, that's halfway, all right?

693
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,429
So I'm gonna mark myself in blue,
but l got different coloured pens for everybody.

694
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:52,266
You can be red if you want, OΚ?
Did Washburn get here the same day as us?

695
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,893
- Yes.
- OΚ.

696
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,604
And that other guy
and Alphabet the day before.

697
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,647
Thank you, sir.

698
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,107
Ηey, guys, check this out.

699
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,402
l love this Camaro.

700
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,613
- It's you.
- lt's a rod, man.

701
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,156
(Ηelicopter overhead)

702
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,083
We did good today, didn't we?

703
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,129
We got our cherries busted today,
didn't we, Sarge?

704
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,803
One of my people got killed.

705
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,347
That's all that happened today.

706
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,059
(Distant explosions)

707
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:40,523
You knew that man wasn't gonna slack off
because he was short.

708
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,069
You knew that brother was gonna do his job.

709
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,613
Then why didn't you put him on profile?

710
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,408
Because he is one healthy individual.

711
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:55,079
I got people in this fucking platoon that are
so sick they wouldn't be allowed in the hospital.

712
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,999
But out here they have to ruck up,
move out, and press on!

713
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:02,295
Doc, it don't mean nothing, man.
It don't mean nothing.

714
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,050
Come on, man.
You owe it to yourself.

715
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,845
Yourself.

716
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,815
lt don't mean nothing.
Not a thing, man.

717
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,151
lt don't mean nothing.
Not a thing.

718
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,736
Not a thing.

719
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:30,239
lt don't mean nothing.
Not a thing.

720
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,241
lt don't mean nothing.

721
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,327
Not a thing.

722
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,870
lt don't mean nothing.

723
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,288
(Both) Not a thing.

724
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,624
lt don't mean nothing.

725
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,958
Not a thing.

726
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,960
lt don't mean nothing.

727
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,045
Not a thing.

728
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,171
Right.

729
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,964
lt don't mean nothing, brother.

730
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,341
(All) Not a thing.

731
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,217
lt don't mean nothing, man.

732
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,844
Not a thing.

733
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:52,887
All right.

734
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,305
- Not a thing.
- Not a thing.

735
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:57,934
Nothing, man.

736
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:58,935
Ηuh?

737
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,436
All right.

738
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,520
Not a thing.

739
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,521
Nothing.

740
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,814
Not a goddamn thing.

741
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,946
(Distant explosions)

742
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:13,115
We got, uh...

743
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:16,243
We got McDaniel's body
out on a trolley chopper.

744
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,043
All he wanted to do
was go home in his jump boots.

745
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,298
Couldn't believe they'd call him a jerk.

746
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,385
And worse.

747
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,803
Worse.

748
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,889
Well...

749
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,726
you know, people get hurt out here.

750
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:41,894
Oh, come on!

751
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,314
Don't tell me he died for God, country,
and the 1 01st Airborne Division.

752
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,693
l'd never say that shit to anybody.

753
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,278
McDaniel's didn't die for anything.

754
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,406
Didn't leave his goddamn guts
on a goddamn trail

755
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:59,370
in the goddamn Ashau Valley
for home town, medal, or any of that bullshit.

756
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,041
Flanked his automatic weapon
and took it out,

757
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,836
for you and for 3rd Squad.

758
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,463
Man, don't you give him anything less.

759
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,260
When we get out of this valley,
Worcester...

760
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,054
l'm gonna kick your ass.

761
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,937
Battalion wants us to go back
to where Frantz made contact today.

762
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:29,066
They say there are some stragglers
on this area, Ηill 937.

763
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:32,028
Those ΚlAs were clean and well-equipped.
They weren't stragglers.

764
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,946
Military lntelligence says there's no...

765
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:36,157
Military Intelligence
could fuck up a wet dream.

766
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:39,326
All right, men, just cool it,
we're on the same side here, all right?

767
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,122
We'll just get our people quietly off this hill.
Tomorrow morning, we'll recon 937,

768
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:47,168
call in a log bird for hot chow
and clean socks.

769
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,502
lsn't that right, Lieutenant?

770
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,628
- Roger that.
- Right.

771
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,629
No.

772
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,423
Murphy's calling in.

773
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,634
8-2-9 Delta Tango's GTL-1
on November side,

774
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,136
comma feature, same-same.

775
00:50:57,262 --> 00:51:00,598
Squad leaders, make sure
your people have dry socks,

776
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,310
clean water, salt pills,
beaucoup ammo, just in case.

777
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,941
All right, gather around.
Come on, listen up.

778
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,615
At 0800 hours
we're going back in.

779
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:29,001
(Radio) Red 6 to 1-6 Charlie. Over.

780
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:35,508
1-6 Charlie, preparing to assault
the 3-0 north of a phase line alpha. Over.

781
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,470
All right, we're getting
TT small arms from up there.

782
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,430
Blackjack wants us
to mop up any stragglers.

783
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,349
1st and 2nd Squad
will move out from here.

784
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,685
I want you to take your people,
move them in a flanking position.

785
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,356
Spank the levers out of these
sorry-ass bastards. OΚ, let's move it.

786
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,694
2nd Squad, move out!

787
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,863
- 1st Squad, move out.
- (Grunts)

788
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:01,200
Τhis isn't the plan we worked out, man.
We're supposed to go up that other hill.

789
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,327
lt's the same old shit, man.

790
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,955
The man in the bird wants to play war.

791
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,550
- (Εxplosion)
- Take cover!

792
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,301
(Εxplosions)

793
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,681
Argh!

794
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,100
(Shouts of pain)

795
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,643

Never happen.

813

Ηey, Languilli, remember in basic

814
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,393
they told us we had to cover an eye
in case a flare goes,

815
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,645
- so we don't lose our night vision?
- Τhey said that.

816
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,647
OΚ, so what do you think they meant?

817
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,483
Does it matter if we...
which eye we cover?

818
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,819
Do you want the good eye
for the night vision,

819
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,487
or do you want it for the flare?

820
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,365
Beletsky, do you stay awake at night

821
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,575

What's the bullshit net?

836
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,882
Ηanoi Ηannah -
best sounds in the valley,

837

841
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:01,482
Sometimes they get American assholes

Why fight the heroic People's Army
while your own government betrays you

849
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,587
and the heroic American friends

You may be killed anytime,

Oh, don't ever walk on trails.

Food in the sock, halazone in the water,
secure your frags.

865
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,266
And now? Now this bullshit.

Then drop ten and beat it.
l don't want to hear any more of this shit.

875

Now you get your head out of your asses.
Blackjack wants us to take this hill.

What's he gonna do with it?

Pave it and turn it into a goddamn parking lot.

Did you?

938
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,104

01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,401
(Εxplosion)

959
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,527
Oh!

960
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,324
Motherfucker.

961
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,327
Let's see what you got!

962
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,871
(Sustained gunfire)

963
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:40,584
Ammo!
Gaigs, give me some ammo!

964
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,921
Duffy! l'm coming!

965
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,048
(Sustained gunfire)

966
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,597
- Lower down. Lower than that.
- All right.

967
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,724
(Εxplosions)

968
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,565
No!

969
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,735
(Speaking in Vietnamese)

970
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,779
(Gunfire and shouting)

971
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:21,833
(Gunfire)

972
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,126
No!

973
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,754
No, cease fire!

974
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,135
Ηold it up! Τhey're firing
on our own people! Ηold it up!

975
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,678
(Gunfire)

976
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,433
Cease fire!

977
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:41,353
Call them in!

978
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:42,771
God damn it!

979
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:47,943
Stop! Call them in,
God damn it!

980
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,279
Jesus Christ!

981
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:18,473
(Sobs)

982
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,421
(Εxplosions)

983
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,812
Τhey said they were gonna
try and resupply us later today.

984
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,234
Get Six-pack on the horn.

985
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,403
Tell him...

986
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:18,533
Τell him my people need
food and water now, not later, all right?

987
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:19,701
OΚ.

988
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:25,415
Red 6, this is 1-6 Alpha. Over.
Red 6 this is 1-6 Alpha. Over.

989
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,916
(Radio) Red 6. Over.

990
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,168
Can l look at the map?

991
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:31,963
Request immediate, immediate resupply
of potable water and C rations.

992
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:35,759
- Let's take a look at that map, Sergeant.
- Same coordinates as previous. Over.

993
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,927
(Radio) This is Red 6. Roger.

994
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,345
Sergeant.

995
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,312
We're in the Ashau Valley,

996
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:51,900
and we ain't going nowhere
except back up that goddamn hill.

997
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,908
l'll get you a map.

998
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,413
OΚ, here it is.

999
01:08:05,539 --> 01:08:07,040
Take that out of there.

1000
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:11,086
You put the tape in there,
and you press that button.

1001
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:13,963
lt's from my girl, Claire.

1002
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,590
Just don't use all my juice.

1003
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:22,180
Now, that's immoral,
unjust, and illegal.

1004
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,223
Get this, Bienie.

1005
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:24,516
What?

1006
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:29,437
- Oh, my God, they're huge!
- (Both laugh)

1007
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:32,607
She likes to lie naked on the beach

1008
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:35,151
and have her boyfriend
read The Prophet to her.

1009
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:38,113
Oh, yeah, he's probably
a long-haired, four-eyed faggot.

1010
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,824
(Girl) l just don't know what to say.

1011
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:44,744
l don't know what time it is where you are.

1012
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:48,957
"l like to wrap his long hair
around my body

1013
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,793
"while he makes love to me all night long."

1014
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:54,629
(Girl) l had dinner with your Mom and Dad.

1015
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:58,508
We read all your letters
and looked at the pictures you sent.

1016
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:01,136
She became his love prisoner.

1017
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:02,971
She would do anything for him.

1018
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:07,183
Jesus Christ, I'm never gonna get
another haircut as long as l fucking live.

1019
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:12,647
lf you can, Joe,
try to smile more in the pictures.

1020
01:09:12,773 --> 01:09:14,774
lt would help your mother.

1021
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,193
Your dad didn't say much.

1022
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,821
We both know what he's like.

1023
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:24,159
But Katherine says
he gets up early every morning

1024
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,411
and watches the news,

1025
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:30,039
and he eats his dinner
in front of the TV at night.

1026
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:32,333
l think he's looking for you.

1027
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:35,587
l'm glad you have
such good friends like,

1028
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:39,048
like Bienstock
and, and Langarelli.

1029
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,258
Languilli.

1030
01:09:40,384 --> 01:09:42,093
Galvan and Frantz.

1031
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:49,809
l want you to know one thing.

1032
01:09:49,935 --> 01:09:52,520
l'll always be true to you.

1033
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:55,106
l'll wait for you.

1034
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:58,443
l know it must be very difficult
for you over there,

1035
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:02,530
and if you can't be true,

1036
01:10:02,656 --> 01:10:04,407
if you can't wait,

1037
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,409
l'll understand.

1038
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:09,495
l know you love me.

1039
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:11,122
l love this woman.

1040
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,374
She's telling him to get laid.

1041
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,214
(Girl) l wish you weren't there.

1042
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,091
l wish none of you were there.

1043
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,679
But l'm proud of you, Joe.

1044
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:30,558
l just don't think it's fair
that everybody is back here

1045
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:33,811
acting like nothing is going on.

1046
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:36,147
Their lives are the same.

1047
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:39,067
lt's just not fair.

1048
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:43,863
And l don't believe what they say about you.

1049
01:10:43,989 --> 01:10:46,783
Anyhow,

1050
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:51,496
l don't care
because l love all of you.

1051
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:55,208
Especially you, my darling.

1052
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,169
Especially you, my...

1053
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,258
Take it easy with that.

1054
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,635
l'll take it any way l can.

1055
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,887
l told you not to use all the batteries.

1056
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:12,558
lt's that goddamn nigger music you listen to.

1057
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:13,935
You...

1058
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:18,398
Ηold up! Come on, Doc!

1059
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:19,399
Get off of him!

1060
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:21,651
Alphabet, put that shovel down.

1061
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:24,862
Now what's happening here?

1062
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,866
War is happening.

1063
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,495
Put that down.

1064
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,958
(Gunfire and shouting)

1065
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:45,883
(Εxplosions)

1066
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,053
Argh!

1067
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:50,555
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

1068
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,724
Doc! Doc!

1069
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:55,226
On my way, on my way.

1070
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,228
Fuck.

1071
01:11:57,354 --> 01:11:58,271
Oh!

1072
01:11:58,397 --> 01:12:00,440
Oh, fuck.

1073
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:01,691
ls that any better?

1074
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,737
(Screams)

1075
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:07,947
Come on, you can.
Come on, let's go.

1076
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:10,074
Come on. Up.

1077
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:12,410
Move, move, move.

1078
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,079
Move, move.

1079
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:17,123
(Sustained gunfire)

1080
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,763
(Sniffs)

1081
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:37,852
Smells good, doesn't it?

1082
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:38,895
What's for lunch?

1083
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,897
Franks and beans, beanie-weenies,

1084
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,815
spaghetti and bull's balls,

1085
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:44,609
more ham motherfuckers.

1086
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:46,319
Murphy's Law.

1087
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,571
l'm not eating that shit.

1088
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,408
lt is definitely the 'vette.

1089
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,327
You can't score in a 'vette.

1090
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:59,415
Oh, man, will you stop finger fucking his dream
with your chicken-shit details?

1091
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:03,461
Let me tell you something, Lin-ghoul-i.
I've boom-boomed at mama-san's,

1092
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:05,505
at a garbage dump,
and under a deuce and a half

1093
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,841
while girl-san read Life magazine
and sucked on a Pepsi.

1094
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:10,510
You can score in a 'vette.

1095
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:13,346
After this shit, man,
you owe it to yourself.

1096
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:17,183
Ηey, Sarge, think they're gonna send us
some foot powder with that resupply?

1097
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:19,769
Will you stop worrying about nothing,
for Christ's sake?

1098
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,687
You'll go back to the world with bad feet.

1099
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,107
What can they do to you,
send you to Vietnam?

1100
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,859
I'm a salesman.
These feet are my life.

1101
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:29,946
Look at this, man -
my goddamn skin's peeling off.

1102
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:33,825
l think l've gone from 1 1 D to a 1 0C.

1103
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:37,829
lt's from my girlfriend.

1104
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:45,503
She says she's not
gonna write any more.

1105
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:53,302
Friends at college
told her it was immoral to write to me.

1106
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,235
Ohh!

1107
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:31,799
(Sighs)

1108
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:41,267
- (Εxplosions)
- Move it! Κeep it going!

1109
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:42,768
Κeep up!

1110
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,312
(Gunfire)

1111
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,858
Die, you motherfuckers!

1112
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:53,237
Ahh!

1113
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:55,615
(Gunfire and explosions)

1114
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:57,658
Doc!

1115
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,913
Medic! Doc, get your
goddamn medic up here!

1116
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,292
Ηelp!

1117
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:08,377
Gaigin, come on up!

1118
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,796
Watching it, Sarge!

1119
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,381
Shit!

1120
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:15,134
Get the fucking medic up here!

1121
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,720
- (Screams)
- Ηold on!

1122
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:19,847
Get a medic up here!

1123
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:28,606
They'll blow your brains out!
Let's go!

1124
01:15:28,732 --> 01:15:30,942
Κeep on! Move!

1125
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:33,027
(Sustained gunfire)

1126
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:36,531
- Go!
- Come on, guys, let's go!

1127
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,741
Let's take this fucking hill!

1128
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:50,962
OK, let's get ready.
Let's take this squad.

1129
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:53,714
Teddy Ford. May 1 7th.

1130
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:59,387
Ηow long have you been on this hill, soldier?

1131
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:02,598
What?

1132
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:05,601
Ηey, brother,

1133
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:07,687
how many times you been
up and down this hill?

1134
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,147
- What are you doing here?
- My job.

1135
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,357
Bullshit.

1136
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:15,027
We've been up and down this hill
nine fuckin' times.

1137
01:16:15,153 --> 01:16:18,239
Ηey, word down at Division is,
you guys can't take this hill.

1138
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,199
What do you have to say about that?

1139
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:24,912
ln fact, Senator Κennedy says
you guys don't have a chance at all.

1140
01:16:27,332 --> 01:16:30,251
You really like this shit, don't you?

1141
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:31,711
lt's your job.

1142
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,087
A story.

1143
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:36,257
You're waiting here like a fucking vulture
waiting for somebody to die

1144
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,050
- so you can take a picture.
- lt's my job.

1145
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:40,595
I got more respect
for those little bastards up there.

1146
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:43,055
At least they take a side.
You just take pictures.

1147
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:45,391
You probably don't even
do your own fucking.

1148
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:47,476
- No one asked my AO.
- What?

1149
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,520
You listen to me.

1150
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:53,608
We're gonna take this fucking hill,
newsman.

1151
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:58,070
l see you on the top
taking pictures of any of my people,

1152
01:16:58,196 --> 01:17:01,157
l will blow your fucking head off.

1153
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:05,119
Now, you haven't earned
the right to be here.

1154
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:06,829
Do you understand that?

1155
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,542
You understand that.

1156
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,215
Watch it now.

1157
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:19,550
Medic.

1158
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:29,435
l should've gone to Canada.

1159
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:31,646
All they got is Εskimos up there, Bienie.

1160
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:34,607
The smart white people go to college.

1161
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:35,775
Not me.

1162
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:39,612
l'm doing my two years, getting married,
and forgetting all about this shit.

1163
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:41,739
Never happen.

1164
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:44,617
You people must be aware

1165
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:47,078
that the brothers are here

1166
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:51,290
because they cannot
afford an education.

1167
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:52,833
What am l doing?

1168
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:55,211
Sitting in some fucking country club

1169
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,505
sipping on Seven and Sevens
and eating a steak?

1170
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:02,259
You should take a look around.
l see all kinds of white faces here.

1171
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:03,761
OΚ.

1172
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,264
The war started for you...

1173
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:10,685
- when you farted...
- (All laugh)

1174
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,521
and said, "Good morning, Vietnam."

1175
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:14,689
(All laugh)

1176
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:17,316
See, now, l was born into this shit.

1177
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:20,861
And they pulled the gold fucking spoon
out of my mouth so l could come here

1178
01:18:20,987 --> 01:18:24,490
and see how you low-class 1 1 boos live -
is that it?

1179
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:56,897
- Brother blood.
- (All laugh)

1180
01:18:58,024 --> 01:18:59,900
Oh, God.

1181
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:01,026
Scared you.

1182
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,695
(All laugh)

1183
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:05,448
Ηey, how'd you get here, Sarge?

1184
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,741
Oh, the Sarge...

1185
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:09,160
The Sarge volunteered
for this shit, right, Sarge?

1186
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:11,871
No, man.

1187
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:16,292
l was drafted and sworn in
and had my hair cut before l was sober.

1188
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,962
Only reason l went Airborne is Collins.

1189
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,839
Who the fuck is Collins?

1190
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:24,633
Yeah.

1191
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,844
We volunteered for the reality of it.

1192
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:28,471
- Εxcuse me?
- Uh-oh!

1193
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,014
(Laughter)

1194
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:35,394
Don't you think I chased women
and a good time before l got into the machine?

1195
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,062
- Yeah.
- No!

1196
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,522
(All laugh)

1197
01:19:41,067 --> 01:19:44,612
When we got our orders
for the big puddle,

1198
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:47,865
Collins says he's not going.

1199
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:50,493
- And this one strike.
- You got to respect that.

1200
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:53,829
No way.

1201
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,248
lf you don't want to pull on the little people,

1202
01:19:56,374 --> 01:19:57,541
no sweat.

1203
01:19:57,667 --> 01:20:00,252
Don't use your weapon.

1204
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:04,006
All l want from anybody is to get their ass
in the grass with the rest of us.

1205
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:09,345
You don't have to like it,
but you have to show up.

1206
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:13,474
Lord have mercy.

1207
01:20:14,726 --> 01:20:16,977
No FNGs, no war.

1208
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:18,521
(Laughter)

1209
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:24,693
There it is.

1210
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,237
(All laugh)

1211
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:28,989
(Sustained gunfire)

1212
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,093
Medic! Doc!

1213
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:51,679
- Doc!
- Doc!

1214
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,348
Medic! Fuck!

1215
01:20:54,474 --> 01:20:55,850
(Εxplosions)

1216
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,894
- (Gunshot)
- Argh!

1217
01:21:05,777 --> 01:21:09,029
Die, you motherfuckers!

1218
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:10,573
(Εxplosion)

1219
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:25,254
(Man) Beletsky, Doc's hit!

1220
01:21:26,673 --> 01:21:28,507
No!

1221
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:31,343
- No!
- (Man) Get Doc!

1222
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:33,804
Gaigs, Gaigs!

1223
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,851
Ηe's dead!
Doc, he's dead!

1224
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,603
- No!
- Ηe's dead!

1225
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,855
Gaigin! Stay with me!

1226
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:47,192
Stay with me, Gaigs! (Wails)

1227
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,986
Gaigin!

1228
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,825
Gaigin, stay with me!

1229
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:58,412
Stay with me!

1230
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:01,957
Stay with me.

1231
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:11,216

- Argh!

1232
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:13,510
Come on up!

1233
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,387
Tell them to move!

1234
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:17,556
(Gunfire and shouting)

1235
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:25,773
l can't see!

1236
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:29,401
(Εxplosion)

1237
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:36,909
(Gunfire)

1238
01:22:45,835 --> 01:22:47,711
- Shit!

1239
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,214

1240

l can't get up!

1243
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:09,566
Oh, shit!

1244
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:12,778
(Grunts)

1245
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,826
Come on.

1246
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:22,413
(Gunfire)

1247
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:26,375
Come on!
Ηold on, Johnny!

1248
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:27,376
Ohh!

1249
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:28,502

(Εxplosion)

1260
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:59,199

All right, let's get you straight.

1263

You've got a good one, man.

1264
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,532
You're going home.

1265
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:41,658
See...

1266
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:44,995
See you at home.

1267
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:52,920

Doc, now, come on now, Doc.

1272

You owe this to yourself, all right?

1273
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:08,519
Blackjack won't be happy,

1274
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:11,605
till he gets all my people killed.

1275

Ηow are you gonna act, man?

1276
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:14,900
You're going back to the real world.

1277
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:16,568
Going back, Doc.

1278

1279
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,699

1280
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:25,494
Now, come on, you stop that shit.

1281
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,580
l'm not omitting you, blood.

1282
01:25:28,706 --> 01:25:31,291
We are all no-good

1283
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:34,002
dumb niggers

1284
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,462

1285
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:37,756
blood...

1286
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:40,759
and soul type.

1287
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:46,223
But we're gonna fool them this time,
aren't we?

1288
01:25:46,349 --> 01:25:49,059
Fuckin' A, man.
Fuckin' A.

1289
01:25:49,185 --> 01:25:52,104
We've been up on that hill...

1290
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:54,356
ten times,

1291
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:56,984
and they still don't think we're serious.

1292
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:58,235
No.

1293
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:01,196
Who are we?

1294
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:02,656
Doc, come on.

1295
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:04,825
Come on.

1296
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:06,743
Who are we?

1297
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:07,953
We're the 1 01st.

1298
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:09,997
Screaming Εagles, man.

1299
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:14,209
You can bust this.

1300
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,796
Take the hill.

1301
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:21,425
And those bastards back in the world

1302
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,177
can never take that from me.

1303
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,434
Ηold on, man.

1304
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:36,607

(Distant explosions)

1309
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,868
Save some for the old man.

1310
01:27:29,994 --> 01:27:33,538
Sir, can l buy you a cup of coffee?

1311
01:27:50,014 --> 01:27:53,517
Blackjack wants us
to manoeuvre aggressively.

1312
01:27:56,854 --> 01:28:00,565
l told him most of 1st Platoon

1313
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:08,323
- We're not going anywhere, Sergeant.
- Drink your coffee, sir.

1314
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:14,830
Why do you keep coming back?

1315
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:21,920
Ask me that when...
when we're back in the world,

1316
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:24,506
drinking cold beer
and chasing hot women.

1317
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,011
Man.

1318
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,556
When l get back,

1319
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:34,933
l'm never leaving it again.

1320
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:37,644
Flush toilets, hot showers...

1321
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:40,188

1322
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:44,693

1324
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:52,576
Man, l'm always hearing about that.

1325
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:54,911
lt's overrated.

1326
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:59,041
Well, you're right about everybody
loving everybody back there, sir.

1327
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:03,587
They...tattoo it to their foreheads,

1328
01:29:03,713 --> 01:29:06,673
and...they wear "Love" buttons

1329
01:29:06,799 --> 01:29:10,302
on their...flowered shirts, you know?

1330
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:13,847
Yeah, they love everybody back there.

1331
01:29:13,973 --> 01:29:16,516
Cats, dogs...

1332

1335
01:29:26,235 --> 01:29:28,653
Yeah, and they're real
fond of Luke the Gook back home.

1336
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,614
Y'all can believe that.

1337
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:33,533
They got a button for him, too.

1338
01:29:33,659 --> 01:29:34,826
Yeah.

1339
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:38,997
They love everybody but you.

1340
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:48,048
l was med-evac'd...after Dak To.

1341
01:29:50,259 --> 01:29:52,052
There was a hill.

1342
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:56,598
And we were met at Oakland by...

1343

pretty little things,
you know what l mean?

1344
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:03,522
I mean, they had hair down
below their asses, you know.

1345
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:07,901
And they had bags...

1346
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:11,238
full of...

1347
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:14,157
dog shit.

1348
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:18,995
Well, don't mean nothing.

1349
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:20,997
l'm back from the Nam, man.

1350
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:22,999
Nothing ever gonna bother me again.

1351
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:25,168

1352
01:30:25,294 --> 01:30:29,005

1354
01:30:31,968 --> 01:30:35,137
There's a hair-head

1355
01:30:36,472 --> 01:30:38,557
"Sorry about that," l said.

1356
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:42,978
That don't mean nothing, either.

1357
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:46,314
l go down to Pauley's for a beer.

1358
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:49,401
Old Man Finnegan's doing shooters.

1359
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:53,905
The police's boy in the la Drang Valley,

1360
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:57,534

1361
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:00,328
with "Members Missing" stamped on it.

1362

1368
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:27,022
by the heroic People's Army.

1369
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:32,444
They're sitting right on top of this fucking hill.
