Welcome to Jurassic World.

While year over year,

Our shareholders have been patient,

84
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,283
no one is impressed
by a dinosaur anymore.

85
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,489
Twenty years ago,
de-extinction was right up there with magic.

look at a <i>Stegosaurus</i>

like an elephant
from the city zoo.

That doesn't mean

Our DNA excavators
discover new species every year.

louder, more teeth.

The good news?

Our advances in gene splicing
have opened up a whole new frontier.

93
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,564
We've learned more from
genetics in the past decade

94
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,642
than a century of
digging up bones.

95

So,

96
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,570
when you say you want to
sponsor an attraction,

97
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,881
what do you have in mind?

98

Our first genetically
modified hybrid.

102
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,642
How did you get two different
kinds of dinosaurs to, you know...

103
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,167
Oh, <i>Indominus</i> wasn't bred.
She was designed.

104
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,487
She will be 50 feet
long when fully grown.

164
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,764
22,216.

165
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,001
Any incidents?
LOWERY: Yes.

166
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,051
Six kids in the Lost and Found,
28 down with heatstroke...

167
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,361
Where did you get that?

168
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,887
Oh, this? I got it on eBay.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

169
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,282
I got it for $150,
but the mint condition one goes for $300...

170
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,522
Didn't occur to you maybe
that's in poor taste?

171
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,250
The shirt?
Yeah, no, it did.

172
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,008
I understand people died.
It was terrible, but that first park was legit.

173
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,009
I have a lot of respect for it.

174
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,764
They didn't need
these genetic hybrids.

175
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,729
They just needed dinosaurs,
real dinosaurs.

176
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,922
Okay, please don't wear it again.
That's kind of enough.

177
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,126
Yeah, I wasn't gonna.

178
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,000
Did you close the deal?
CLAIRE: Looks like it.

179
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,965

presents the <i>Indominus rex.</i>

180
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,485
Ugh, that is so terrible.

181
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,724
Why not just go
the distance, Claire,

182
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,531
and just let these corporations
name the dinosaurs?

183
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,846
They've got all the ballparks.

184
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,327
Why stop there?
Why are the West Plains closed?

185
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,767
Another Pachy roaming
outside his zone.

186
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,922
But he's fully sedated
and ready for relocation.

187

or Tostito-don.

188

Security said
the invisible fences were a no-fail.

189
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,644
That is the second
time this month.

190
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,042
VIVIAN: Well, the Pachys short out
their implants when they butt heads.

191
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,208
How much longer
until they get it out of there?

192
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,567
He just got five
milligrams of carfentanil.

193
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,043
Yes, he's very stoned.
So why don't we show a little sympathy?

194
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,403
I mean, you do understand
these are actual animals, right?

195
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,244
Clean up your workspace.
It's chaotic.

196
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,483
I like to think of
it as a living system.

197
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,009
Just enough stability
to keep it from collapsing into anarchy.

You are flying.

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,405
I got my license.

202
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,727
Two more.
Well, two more days.

203
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,926
Okay.
So,

204
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,042
how's my park doing?
CLAIRE: Great.

205
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,128
We're up 2.5% over last year.

206
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,288
A bit lower than our
initial projection.

207
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,811
No, no, no, how's it doing?

208
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,043
Are the guests having fun?
Are the animals enjoying life?

209
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,681
Well, guest
satisfaction is steady in the low 90s.

210
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,322
We don't have a way to measure
the animals' emotional experience.

211
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,006
Sure you do.
You can see in their eyes.

212
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,320
Right?

213
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,811
Of course. (CHUCKLES)

214
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,925
Okay. Now show me
my new dinosaur.

215

(GASPS)
MASRANI: Oh...

216
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,404
Got it.

217
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,410
Got it.

218
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,568
Oh, my!

219
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,046
You look tense, Claire.

220
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,608
Maybe you should just
focus on the controls.

221
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,967
The key to a happy
life is to accept

222
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,725
you are never
actually in control.

223
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,887
Bird!

224
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,442
You should spend a day at the beach.
Get some sun.

225
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,045
Uh, right, so...

226
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,806
Marketing thought
we could offset some of the costs by...

227
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,968
Enough about cost.

228
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,168
John Hammond entrusted me
with his dying wish,

229
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,408
and not once did
he mention profits.

230
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,608
"Spare no expense,"
he used to say.

231
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,681
I appreciate that,

232
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,207
but the reality of operating
a theme park requires...

233
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,322
Don't forget why we
built this place, Claire.

234
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,722
Jurassic World exists to
remind us how very small we are.

235
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,844
How new. You can't
put a price on that.

236
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,328
Now, please, we're flying.

237
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,203
Breathe.

238
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,526
(GASPS)

239
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,489
Is he okay?
Are you okay?

240
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,927
He's just being dramatic.

241
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,809
Are you still building?

242
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,363
We planned to open in May,

243
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,206
but Asset Containment insisted
we build the walls up higher.

244
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,362
It's bigger than expected.

245
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,925
It's a good sign.

246
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,684
We hit a few
speed bumps early on.

247
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,889
It began to anticipate
where the food would come from.

248
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,889
One of the handlers
nearly lost an arm.

249
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,885
The others threatened to quit if
I couldn't guarantee their safety.

250
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,209
She's intelligent then?

251
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,409
For a dinosaur.

252
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,568
And that?

253
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,804
It tried to break the glass.

254
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,928
I like her spirit.

256
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,841
It's white. You never
told me it was white.

257
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,442
Think it will scare the kids?

258
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,204
The kids?

259
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,368
This will give the
parents nightmares.

260
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,484
Is that good?

261
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,607
It's fantastic.

262
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,404
Can she see us?

263
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,208
They say it can
sense thermal radiation.

264
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,611
Like snakes.

265
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,688
I thought there
were two of them.

266
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,247
There was a sibling
in case this one didn't survive infancy.

267
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,322
Where's the sibling?

268
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,487
She ate it.

He has to be smarter.

He only thinks he's smarter.

I want you to bring him in.

Let him inspect the paddock.

321
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,365
These are wild animals, Hoskins.

322
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,283
Trust me, you don't
want them in the field.

323
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,569
I just saw a bond.
A real bond.

324
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,768
Between man and beast.

325
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,841
You're in my way.

326
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,285
Come on.
We're the same.

327
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,850
We're dogs of war.

328
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,009
We know that the military
needs to reduce casualties.

329
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,082
Some people think that
robots are the future.

330
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,731
Look, nature gave
us the most effective

331
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,371

million years ago.

332
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,926
And now we know
they can take orders.

333
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,685
We finally make progress
and that's the first thing he says?

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,811
Shit.

00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,245
Come on, gents.

337
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,362
It's grown-up time.

338
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,161
Drones can't search tunnels and caves.
And they're hackable.

339
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,605
The minute a real
war breaks out,

340
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,967
all that fancy
tech is gonna go dark.

341
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,044
But that tech's not gonna eat them
if they forget to feed it.

342
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,529
Look at these creatures.

343
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,444
They've got millions
of years of instinct in their cells,

344
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,680
instinct that we can program.

345
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,167
Their loyalty cannot be bought.

346
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,371
These guys are gonna run

347
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,408
straight into the enemy's
teeth and eat them,

348
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,483

349
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,961
What if they decide
they wanna be in control?

350
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,211
Well, then we remind them who is.
We terminate the rogues.

351
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,567
Promote only loyal bloodlines.

You come here

and you don't learn
anything about these animals

355

except what you want to know.

356

You made them,
and now you think you own them.

357
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,490
We do own them.

358
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,402
Extinct animals have no rights.

359
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,331
They're not extinct
anymore, Hoskins.

360
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,688
Exactly. We're
sitting on a goldmine.

361
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,128
And Masrani is using it
to stock a petting zoo.

some humility. He doesn't make weapons.

363

(CHUCKLING) You think that the eighth
richest man in the world

364
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,448
is only into oil, telecom,
and family fun parks?

365

He's so diversified,
he doesn't even know what he owns.

How long has InGen
been practicing this pitch?

Since the day we hired you out of the Navy.
You knew the end game.

368
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,680
These animals can replace
thousands of boots on the ground.

369
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,762
How many lives
would that save?

481
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,966
I'm pretty busy.

482
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,610
We have an attraction.

483
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,603
That's not what you said
the last time I saw you.

484
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,921
I'm talking about
the dinosaurs, Mr. Grady.

485
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,525
Owen.

486
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,722
A new species we've made.
(FLY BUZZING)

487
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,844
You just went and
made a new dinosaur?

488
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,003
Yeah, it's kind
of what we do here.

489
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,960
The exhibit opens to the public
in three weeks.

490
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,125
Mr. Masrani wanted me
to consult with you.

491
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,444
You wanna consult
here or in my bungalow?

492
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,970
That's not funny.
(LAUGHS)

493
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,045
A little funny.

494
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,010
We'd like you to evaluate the
paddock for vulnerabilities.

495
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,730
Why me?

496
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,521
I guess Mr. Masrani thinks,
since you're able to control the Raptors...

497
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,966
It's all about control with you.

498
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,249
I don't control the Raptors.
It's a relationship.

499
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,567
It's based on mutual respect.

500
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,762
That's why you and I
never had a second date.

501
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,691
Excuse me?
I never wanted a second date.

502
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,728
Who prints out an
itinerary for a night out?

503
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,410
I'm an organized person.

504
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,046
What kind of a diet
doesn't allow tequila?

505
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,804
All of them,
actually.

506
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,289
And what kind of a man shows
up to a date in board shorts?

507
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,442
It's Central America.
It's hot. Okay. Okay.

508
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,450
Can we just focus
on the asset, please?

509
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,965
The asset?

510
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,850
Look, I get it.
You're in charge out here.

511
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,160
You gotta make a lot
of tough decisions.

512
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,605
It's probably easier
to pretend these animals

513
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,081
are just numbers
on a spreadsheet.

514
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,845
But they're not.
They're alive.

515
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,602
I'm fully aware they're alive.

516
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,405
You might have made them in a test tube,
but they don't know that.

517
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,722
They're thinking,
"I gotta eat.

518
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,284
"I gotta hunt. I gotta..."

519
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,847
You can relate to at
least one of those things.

520
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,126
Right?

521
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,921
I'll be in the car.

522
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,206
You might want to
change your shirt.

523
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,489
They're very sensitive to smell.

it could sink its teeth into,</i>

527
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,970
<i>including turtles, large fish,
even smaller Mosasaurs.</i>

528
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,848
<i>Okay, folks, let's see if she's still
hungry after already eating today.</i>

<i>She's a little shy, so be nice and
give her a hand when she comes out.</i>

CLAIRE: We've been
pre-booking tickets for months.

540
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,131
The park needs a new
attraction every few years

541
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,487
in order to reinvigorate
the public's interest.

542
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,483
Kind of like the space program.

543
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,121
Corporate felt genetic modification
would up the wow factor.

544
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,288
They're dinosaurs.
Wow enough.

545
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,767
Not according to
our focus groups.

546
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,081
The <i>Indominus rex</i>
makes us relevant again.

547
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,202
(CHUCKLING)
The <i>Indominus rex?</i>

548
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,329
We needed something scary
and easy to pronounce.

549
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,771
You should hear
a four-year-old

550
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,962
try to say
<i>"Archaeornithomimus."</i>

551
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,321
You should hear
you try to say it.

552
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,484
So what's this thing made of?

553
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,967
The base genome is a T. rex.
The rest is classified.

554
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,771
You made a new dinosaur,
but you don't even know what it is?

555
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,808
The lab delivers
us finished assets,

556
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,245
and we show
them to the public.

557
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,323
Can we drop a steer, please?

558
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,329
How long has the
animal been in here?

559
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,411
All its life.

560
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,767
Never seen anything
outside of these walls?

561
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,166
We can't exactly walk it.

562
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,805
And you feed it with that?

563
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,804
Is there a problem?

564
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,283
Animals raised in isolation aren't
always the most functional.

565
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,890
Your Raptors are
born in captivity.

566
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,442
With siblings.
They learn social skills.

567
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,170
And I imprint on
them when they're born.

568
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,606
There's trust.

569
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,810
The only positive relationship this
animal has is with that crane.

570
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,285
At least she
knows that means food.

571
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,330
So, she needs a friend.

572
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,808
We should schedule play-dates?
That sort of thing?

573
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,724
Probably not a good idea.

574
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,240
Where is it?

575
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,481
Is it in the basement?

576
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,008
Is there a downstairs?
Maybe it's in the rec room.

577
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,322
It was just here.
We were just here.

marks always there?

583

Do you think it...

584

Oh, God.

585
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,370
She has an
implant in her back.

586
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,125
I can track it
from the control room.

What purpose could we
have for a dinosaur that can camouflage?

807
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,851
Cuttlefish genes were added

808
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,242
to help her withstand
an accelerated growth rate.

809
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,440
Cuttlefish have chromatophores that allow
the skin to change color.

Nothing in Jurassic
World is natural.

834
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,645
We have always filled gaps in the
genome with the DNA of other animals.

835
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,286
And, if their
genetic code was pure,

836
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,964
many of them would
look quite different.
