What I read
in the newspaper, sir.

Then you'll know
that Moonraker,
the space shuttle,

was being flown over here

00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:07,058
coincident with your country's
one indisputable contribution

163
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:09,977
to Western civilization.

164
00:16:10,062 --> 00:16:11,813
Afternoon tea.

165
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:14,982
May I press you to
a cucumber sandwich?

166
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,443
Thank you, no,
nothing at all.

167
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:20,363
The shuttle, is it made
entirely here in California?

168
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:23,074
No. I own a number
of subsidiaries
throughout the world,

169
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:24,909
producing components.

170
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:27,328
The conquest of space
represents an investment

171
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:30,581
in the future of the entire
human race, Mr. Bond.

172
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,959
It is, therefore,
logical to seek out

173
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:35,753
the best that each
nation has to offer.

174

to people or skills?

175

Both, Mr. Bond.

176

Am I too soon?

177
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:55,982
Not at all.

178
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:59,527
I'm sure Mr. Bond
is eager to start his tour.

179
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:00,820
Miss Dufour will escort you

180
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:03,281
to Dr. Goodhead
who will show you around.

181

182

Thank you for being
so cooperative.

183
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,078
A pleasure.

184
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,216
Look after Mr. Bond.

185
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,219

comes to him.

186

Can I help you?

192

Yes. My name is Bond.
James Bond.

193
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:06,636
I'm looking for Dr. Goodhead.

194
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,429
You just found her.

195
00:18:09,598 --> 00:18:11,349
A woman.

196
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:15,228
Your powers of observation
do you credit, Mr. Bond.

197
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:17,271
James, to my friends.

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,774
Holly Goodhead.

199
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:22,818
Are you training
to be an astronaut?

200
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,071
I'm fully trained.

201
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:28,199
On loan from NASA,
the Space Administration.

202
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:32,870
Well, Mr. Bond,
I guess we'd
better get started.

203
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:37,166
You don't want to lose time
as well as a space shuttle,
do you?

204
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,592
This is it,
the Moonraker.

205
00:18:46,677 --> 00:18:49,095
Capable of being launched
into space by rocket...

206
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:51,389
Orbiting the Earth
and reentering
the atmosphere to land

207
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:53,849
like any conventional
aircraft.

208
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:03,067
GOODHEAD: This is
the centrifuge training.

209
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:07,780
BOND: It simulates
the gravity force you feel
when shot into space.

210
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:15,830
The speed is controlled by
the instructor from up there.

211
00:19:15,914 --> 00:19:17,999
Why not try it?

212
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:21,502
Why not?

213
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:29,510
Strap yourself in firmly.

214
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:32,555
Yes, Doctor.

215
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:35,725
Now your arms.

216
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,269
That's to prevent you
from knocking yourself out.

217
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:39,645
BOND: I see.

218
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:49,822
How fast does it go?

219
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:54,118
It can go up to 20 Gs,
but that would be fatal.

220
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:56,954
Three Gs is equivalent
to take-off pressure.

221
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,041
Most people
pass out at seven.

You don't have to worry.
This is what we call
a "Chicken Switch. "

224

You just keep your
finger on that button,

225
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:11,469
the moment the pressure
gets too much for you,
release the button

226
00:20:11,553 --> 00:20:13,012
and the power's cut off.

227
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:14,138

Come on, Mr. Bond.

230
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:19,018
A 70-year-old
can take 3 Gs.

231
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,522
Well, the trouble is
there is never a 70-year-old
around when you need one.

232
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:31,155
GOODHEAD: You want me?

233
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,907
Mr. Drax says
to telephone him.

234

All right,
I'll call him
from my office.

Yes. We're taking
good care of him.

I don't know what
could've happened.

240

gone wrong with

Let me help you.

242

My mother gave me
a list of things
not to do on a first date.

243
00:24:23,388 --> 00:24:25,139
Maybe you won't need it.

244
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:26,974
That's not what I came for.

245
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:30,144
No. What do you want then?

246
00:24:32,731 --> 00:24:37,443
Would your feelings
be shattered if I were
to say information?

247

Why should l
tell you anything?

Why, indeed?

249
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,705
You presume
a great deal, Mr. Bond.

250
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:09,266
What goes on here
besides the manufacture
of Moonraker?

happening now.

948
02:00:17,219 --> 02:00:18,178
What is it?

949
02:00:18,262 --> 02:00:20,513
We're skipping on
the Earth's atmosphere.

950
02:00:20,598 --> 02:00:21,890
In range.

951
02:00:31,567 --> 02:00:33,902
We should see
the last one soon.

952
02:00:35,154 --> 02:00:37,530
There it is.

953
02:00:46,207 --> 02:00:48,166
It's getting hot.
It can't be helped.

954
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:50,001
I'm coming in
at a steeper angle
than I should

955
02:00:50,086 --> 02:00:52,003
in order to catch
that last globe.

956
02:00:59,512 --> 02:01:01,930
I can't hold this
course much longer.

957
02:01:02,056 --> 02:01:04,474
We'll break up
at 200,000 feet.

958
02:01:04,558 --> 02:01:06,267
Just a few seconds more.

959
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:18,780
Automatic firing
system negative.

960
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:21,491
Must be the heat.
Switching to manual.

961
02:01:36,298 --> 02:01:38,383
Controls aren't responding.

962
02:01:41,470 --> 02:01:43,138
The wings are
beginning to glow.

963
02:01:43,347 --> 02:01:45,098
Just hold her steady.

964
02:01:47,435 --> 02:01:48,643
Steady.

965
02:02:03,242 --> 02:02:05,326
GOODHEAD: It's entering
Earth's atmosphere!

966
02:02:06,203 --> 02:02:08,329
James, this is
our last chance.

967
02:02:11,083 --> 02:02:12,292
Steady.

968
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:32,812
Colonel Scott
reports picking up

969
02:02:32,897 --> 02:02:34,522
two survivors from
the space station,

970
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:37,066
a tall man and
a short blonde woman.

971
02:02:37,151 --> 02:02:39,861
Right. Okay.

972
02:02:39,945 --> 02:02:42,530
Dr. Goodhead reported
their position 20 minutes ago.

973
02:02:42,615 --> 02:02:45,700
They're just coming into
range of our tracking ship
in the Pacific Ocean.

974
02:02:45,826 --> 02:02:47,285
We should have audiovisual
within a few minutes

975
02:02:47,369 --> 02:02:49,037
from the remote
onboard TV monitors.

976
02:02:52,958 --> 02:02:54,959
<i>MAN ON RADIO:</i>
<i>Houston calling Dr. Goodhead. </i>

977
02:02:55,044 --> 02:02:57,670
<i>Houston calling. </i>
<i>Confirm your position. </i>

978
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:07,013
As this is the first
joint venture between
our two countries,

979
02:03:07,097 --> 02:03:08,431
I'm having it
patched directly

980
02:03:08,516 --> 02:03:10,683
to the White House
and Buckingham Palace.

981
02:03:10,768 --> 02:03:13,728
Well, I'm sure Her Majesty
will be fascinated.

982
02:03:13,813 --> 02:03:14,896
MAN: We have audiovisual.

983
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:16,147
Ah, at last.

984
02:03:18,984 --> 02:03:21,319
(PEOPLE MURMURING)

985
02:03:26,408 --> 02:03:28,243
(SOFTLY) 007.

986
02:03:28,410 --> 02:03:30,245
My God, what's Bond doing?

987
02:03:30,329 --> 02:03:32,956
I think he's attempting
re-entry, sir.

988
02:03:46,178 --> 02:03:47,428
James?

989
02:03:47,513 --> 02:03:49,180
I think it may be
time to go home.

990
02:03:49,932 --> 02:03:53,101
Take me round the world
one more time.

991
02:03:53,185 --> 02:03:54,435
Why not?

992
02:04:02,611 --> 02:04:05,321
<i>Where are you?</i>

993
02:04:06,574 --> 02:04:09,617
<i>Why do you hide?</i>

994
02:04:10,536 --> 02:04:13,204
<i>Where is that moonlight trail</i>

995
02:04:13,289 --> 02:04:15,915
<i>That leads to your side?</i>

996
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:20,879
<i>Just like the Moonraker goes</i>

997
02:04:20,963 --> 02:04:25,258
<i>In search of his dream of gold</i>

998
02:04:25,384 --> 02:04:28,928
<i>I search for love</i>

999
02:04:29,138 --> 02:04:32,974
<i>For someone to have and hold</i>

1000
02:04:33,058 --> 02:04:36,561
<i>I've seen your smile</i>

1001
02:04:36,812 --> 02:04:40,982
<i>In a thousand dreams</i>

1002
02:04:41,317 --> 02:04:43,943
<i>Felt your touch</i>

1003
02:04:44,737 --> 02:04:48,907
<i>And it always seems</i>

1004
02:04:48,991 --> 02:04:58,291
<i>You love me</i>

1005
02:05:06,008 --> 02:05:09,385
<i>Where are you?</i>

1006
02:05:09,929 --> 02:05:13,723
<i>When will we meet?</i>

1007
02:05:13,974 --> 02:05:16,601
<i>Take my unfinished life</i>

1008
02:05:16,685 --> 02:05:19,354
<i>And make it complete</i>

1009
02:05:19,438 --> 02:05:24,275
<i>Just like the Moonraker knows</i>

1010
02:05:24,401 --> 02:05:28,279
<i>His dream will</i>
<i>come true someday</i>

1011
02:05:29,031 --> 02:05:32,325
<i>I know that you</i>

1012
02:05:32,409 --> 02:05:36,120
<i>Are only a kiss away</i>

1013
02:05:36,205 --> 02:05:39,958
<i>I've seen your smile</i>

1014
02:05:40,042 --> 02:05:43,711
<i>In a thousand dreams</i>

1015
02:05:44,630 --> 02:05:48,049
<i>Felt your touch</i>

1016
02:05:48,133 --> 02:05:51,928
<i>And it always seems</i>
