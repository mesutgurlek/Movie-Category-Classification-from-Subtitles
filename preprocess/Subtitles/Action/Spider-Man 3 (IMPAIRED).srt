1
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,499
<i>It's me, Peter Parker.</i>

2
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,599
<i>Your friendly neighborhood... you know.</i>

3
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,099
<i>I've come a long way from being the boy who was bit by a spider.</i>

4
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,850
<i>Back then, nothing seemed to go right for me.</i>

5
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,199
<i>- Now...</i>
- Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!</i>

6
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,099
<i>people really like me.</i>

7
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,150
- Hey, stick around! It's gonna start again in a couple minutes.
- Yeah... - That's OK.

8
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,599
<i>The city is safe and sound.</i>

9
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,199
<i>Guess I've had something to do with that.</i>

10
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,050
<i>My uncle Ben would be proud.</i>

11
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,750
WHY NY <3'S SPIDEY

12
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,899
<i>I still go to school,
top of my class.</i>

13
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,299
Now, the Hamiltonian shows us

14
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,750
that the energy levels are perturbed by the electric field.

15
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,899
From the form of this matrix,

16
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,599
we can see...?

17
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,899
- Miss Stacey?
- That only the m=0 quantum states are affected.

18
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,150
Correct! Good work, Miss Stacey.

19
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,899
Parker.

20
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,999
You got something to add?

21
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,150
No, sir.

22
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,199
<i>And I'm in love</i>

23
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,550
<i>with the girl of my dreams.</i>

24
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,499
Hi. Um, Miss Watson left a ticket for me?

25
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,850
Peter Parker.

26
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,650
Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you.

27
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,250
It's my girlfriend!

28
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,299
Harry!

29
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,999
I need to talk to you.

30
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,699
Explain things.

31
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,799
Tell it to my father.

32
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,599
Raise him from the dead.

33
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,199
I'm your friend, Harry.

34
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,650
I cared about your father.

35
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,999
MJ.

36
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,299
Peter.

37
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,099
- Was I good?
- Good?

38
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,299
- You were great. You were...
- You say great?

39
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,399
I love my flowers. They're beautiful.

40
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,299
And those are from Harry.

41
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,199
Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.

42
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,799
What's with you guys anyway?

43
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,399
It's complicated.

44
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,599
Tell me again, was I really good?

45
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,299
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.

46
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,999
- Your knees were fine.
- The applause was not very loud.

47
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,399
Yes, it was.

48
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,099
It's the acoustics.
It's all about diffusion.

49
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,099
It keeps the sound waves from grouping.

50
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,850
- You see, when the sound waves, they propagate, then it's like an...
- You are such a nerd.

51
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,850
Did you see that one?

52
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,799
You know what?

53
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,799
I'd like to sing on stage for the rest of my life

54
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,199
with you in the first row.

55
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,150
I'll be there.

56
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,150
Tell me you love me.

57
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,199
I love you.

58
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,599
I love you so much.

59
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,450
I always have.

60
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,799
You can't hide here, Flint.

61
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,499
I'm just here to see my daughter.

62
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,199
You are an escaped convict.

63
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,699
The cops are looking for you.

64
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,099
You're not getting near her.

65
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,299
You're nothing but a common thief.

66
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,199
You maybe even killed a man.

67
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,099
It wasn't even like that.

68
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,699
Wasn't.

69
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,199
I had good reason for what I was doing.

70
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,499
And that's the truth.

71
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,999
You and the truth, sitting in prison, having three meals a day together.

72
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,099
I live in a prison. It's a great truth.

73
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,299
And that is the truth that you left behind.

74
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,650
Right there in that bedrooom.

75
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,899
I missed you.

76
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,950
I missed you too, Daddy.

77
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,099
I promise

78
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,199
I'll make you healthy again.

79
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,899
Whatever it takes.

80
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,299
- I'll get the money.
- You get out of here.

81
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,950
Now.

82
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,299
I'm not a bad person.

83
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,150
Just had bad luck.

84
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,799
Peter, what is it?

85
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,199
It's MJ...

86
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,199
I'm gonna ask her to marry me!

87
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,699
Oh, Peter! Oh!

88
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,499
The day that uncle Ben asked me to marry him,

89
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,399
he was so scared and excited.

90
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,799
And very young.

91
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,699
And I loved him so fiercely.

92
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,299
Then you said yes, right?

93
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,699
No. I wanted to say yes, but I said no.

94
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,299
I wasn't ready,

95
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,499
neither was he.

96
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,199
So we took our time.

97
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,599
Looked forward to it.

98
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,699
Didn't want to run into something with nothing to count on but love.

99
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,199
A man has to be understanding

100
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,499
and put his wife before himself.

101
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,450
Can you do that, Peter?

102
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,799
Yeah. I think I can.

103
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,599
Then you have my blessing.

104
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,399
I hope you've considered a proper proposal.

105
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,799
Your uncle had it all planned.

106
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,099
He took me to the beach one Sunday.

107
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,799
He was a knockout in his bathing suit.

108
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,099
And I, I didn't look too bad myself.

109
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,699
We were very good swimmers.

110
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,299
It was a beautiful day,

111
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,599
and he said: "Let's swim to the island."

112
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,899
And at the island,

113
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,699
we found a perfect spot by an old tree,

114
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,699
and we lay down and looked up at the sky.

115
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,499
And then he said, "Close your eyes, May."

116
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,999
And I did. And then he said, "Open them."

117
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,899
And I did.

118
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,099
And he was holding this ring.

119
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,150
Dazzling, in front of me.

120
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,950
I thought it was the sun.

121
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,599
We'd be married 50 years

122
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,750
come August... if...

123
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,099
So.

124
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,699
I hope you make it very special

125
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,299
for Mary Jane.

126
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,750
Do something she'll never forget.

127
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,799
Give her this.

128
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,199
Come on.

129
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,950
Take it.

130
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:55,850
- Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.

131
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,599
Listen to me! I didn't kill your father!

132
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,799
He was trying to kill me. He killed himself.

133
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,150
Shut up!

134
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,850
I'm still here, Peter!

135
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,950
Hate those things.

136
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,150
Harry.

137
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,934
Harry.

138
00:21:21,935 --> 00:21:26,150
Harry!

139
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,750
Oh my God.

140
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,450
Harry!

141
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,150
Come on!

142
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,550
God!

143
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,899
- 200.
- And clear!

144
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,199
- No response.
- Recharge. Let's go again.

145
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,999
Clear!

146
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,099
No response.

147
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,050
We charge it one more time. And clear!

148
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,199
Captain Stacey.

149
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,099
- What's this?
- Flint Marko, the guy we tied to the Ben Paker homicide.

150
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,899
- What about him?
- He just broke out of Rikers.

151
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,499
-And?
- He's on the run.

152
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,850
He's in the Marshlands. I think we got him.

153
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,750
There he is!

154

<i>"DANGER PARTICLE PHYSICS

155
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,050
Eton, take the west side. Tom,you take the east.

156
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,150
Where'd he go?

157
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,099
-That's it. It's charged.
- Right.

158
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,399
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation on 1.

159
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,099
There's a change in the silicon mass.

160
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,399
It's probably a bird. It'll fly away when we fire it up.

Initiating demoleculisation.

162
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,599
-How is he?
- He's gonna be OK.

163
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,099
But there's been some memory impairment.

164
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,699
Particularly his short-term memory.

165
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,899
Right now, he can't remember the accident

166
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,999
or anything that happened to him recently.

167
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,299
Is it permanent?

00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,899
It could be.

169
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,899
Only time will tell.

170
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,799
He's awake if you want to see him.

171
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,499
Uh-- maybe I should wait.

172
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,850
Nah, it's fine. Just keep it brief. Allow him to rest.

173
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,650
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

174
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,799
Hit my head.

175
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,799
Yeah.

176
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,599
Doctor said I was in an accident. Hit and run.

177
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,999
I don't remember much of anything.

178
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,299
My father--

179
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,950
he died, right?

180
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,699
This is all so weird.

181
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,399
Hi. I got here as fast as I could.

182
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,999
I know that face.

183
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,334
How are you doing?

184
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:12,499
I don't know.

185
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,499
Last thing I remember, I was falling...

186
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,199
somewhere.

187
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,699
You're still fine.

188
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,999
We love you, Harry.

189
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,999
It feels like

190
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,050
somehow I've been gone for a really long time.

191
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,599
Now I'm back home.

192
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,899
It's good to have you back.

193
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,499
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you guys to scoot, OK?

194
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,499
- OK.
- All right, thank you.

195
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,199
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

196
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,450
Yeah, great.

197
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,999
I think he's gonna be fine.

198
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,299
Think so.

199
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,050
- And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.

200
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,699
You have lovely friends.

201
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,850
My best friends.

202
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,850
I'd give my life for them.

203
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,750
[knocks on door]
- Yeah?
- It's me. - Oh! Hey!

204
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,299
You know I can't open the door.

205
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,499
It's stuck again?

206
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,799
Come on and help me.

207
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,150
I'm coming.

208
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,499
- The review.
- Oh!

209
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,099
The hated it. They hated me.

210
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,699
Well, they can't hate you.

211
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,399
"The young Miss Watson is a pretty girl."

212
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,599
"Easy on the eyes, but not on the ears."

213
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,899
"Her small voice didn't carry past the first row."

214
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,099
That's ridiculous. I was right there.

215
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,899
You were in the first row.

216
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,099
Yeah, but that's...

217
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,599
Listen. You were great.

218
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,499
That's a critic.

219
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,099
This is something you're gonna have to get used to.

220
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,499
Believe me, I know.

221
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,599
- Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.
- This isn't about you.

222
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,799
It's about me.

223
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,899
- It's about my career.
- I know, and I'm just saying,

224
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,899
you can't let it bring you down.

225
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,399
You just gotta believe in yourself.
You pull yourself together,

226
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,899
- and you get right back on the horse.
- Don't give me the horse thing.

227
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,950
Try to understand how I feel.

228
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,650
It's just...

229
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,799
I look at these words,

230
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,150
and it's like my father wrote them.

231
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,050
<i>All cars. All cars in the vicinity of 54th and 6th Ave, 
please report. Crane out of control. Approach with caution.</i>

232
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,650
Go get 'em, tiger.

233
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,150
Sorry.

234
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,799
Oh my God.

235
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,499
Seven *Atom* to Central. That crane's sheaves are off..

236
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:39,150
It's bigger than we thought. 
We're gonna need a major mobilization right away.

237
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,550
Shutting down the accelerator! Now!

238
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,650
OK, Gwen.
I've got a secret. It's my call for ya.

239
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,550
What is that thing doing in my background?

240
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,099
Captain Stacey, the guys looks *kind short of it.
They can't shut down the crane.

241
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,399
Get Edison on the phone.

242
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,650
Have them kill the power of the whole block.

243
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,150
Are you all right?

244
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:38,151
It's coming back!

245
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,299
Oh my God. It's Gwen!

246
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,150
What?

247
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,099
What's she doing up there?

248
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,799
I don't know. I just saw her last night. 
She said she had a modelling gig.

249
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,799
-Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir.

250
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,299
Eddie Brock, jr.

251
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,799
I work at the Daily Bugle.

252
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,750
And I'm dating your daughter.

253
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,699
-You OK?
- Yeah.

254
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,899
I'm fine.

255
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,199
Thank you.

256
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,499
Hey, Spidey, hold on. Bugle needs a photo.

257
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,599
-Thank God, you're OK.
- Daddy!

258
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:36,599
-Hey. I'm the new guy.
- New guy?

259
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,799
From now on, I'm gonna be taking shots of you for the Bugle.

260
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,599
So-- smile! Are you smiling?

261
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,099
Where's the other guy?
- Peter Parker?

262
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,199
Yeah, um, look, between you and me--

263
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,199
The guy's kind of an amateur.

264
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,299
Have you noticed, his stuff makes you look a little... bloated.

265
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,050
-Just a little chunky.
- OK...

266
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,850
Don't have to worry about that anymore, buddy.

267
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,650
Dazzeling.

268
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,099
Just a little something the boys in the ad department and I whipped up.

269
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,099
As you know, circulation of the Bugle has been pretty good.

270
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,399
Though not as good as the New York Times

271
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,934
or the Daily News

272
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,299
-or the Post or several other smaller...
- Get on with it, moron!

273
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,999
-What?
- Your blood pressure, Mr Jameson.

274
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,850
-Your wife told me to tell you to watch the anger.
- You tell my wife...

275
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,450
Thank you.

276
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,399
So, I propose this campaign:

277
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,199
"DAILY BUGLE" -- that's obvious.

278
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,599
"IT'S HIP, IT'S NOW" -- I came up with that one.

279
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:57,899
"IT'S WOW" -- that's actually Eric's.

280
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,299
"AND HOW!" -- that's me again.

281
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,299
Time to take your pill.

282
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,799
Not that one.

283
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,050
Not that one.

284
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:20,050
Drink plenty of water.

285
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,950
Thank you.

286
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,950
Continue.

287
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,599
He's busy.

288
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,099
Oh, no, I'm just here to talk to you, babe.
(- What's that smell?)

289
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,699
That's a little something called

290
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,699
"Nice 'n' Easy".

291
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,399
-What's on you?
- It's called "Go Away".

292
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,899
-That is the dumbest idea you've ever had. You have had some daunting...
- Blood pressure.

293
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,299
Hey, where are you going?

294
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,099
-Who are you?
- You hired him last week.

295
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,099
-Freelance.
- I did? What's that smell?

296
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,799
Brock, Sir. Edward Brock junior.

297
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,199
Wow, I really like that shirt.

298
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,299
Here. It's a crane accident. Check out the light source.

299
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,799
He likes my shirt.

300
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,899
-Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete. You better get in there.

301
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,950
A new guy. He's trying to sell some Spidey photos.

302
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,399
Uh. Thanks.

303
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,099
Parker! You're late! Maybe too late. Bruckner here beat ya to it.

304
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,799
-It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior.
- I got you this.

305
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,499
But he got me this.

306
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,699
-Wait. How'd you get that? I didn't see you.
- How'd you get that high?

307
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,099
Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.

308
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,999
A flagpole?

309
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,999
-Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.

310
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,499
-It's better.
- Cheaper, too.

311
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,299
Congratulations, son. We'll use your shot and pay you 50 bucks.

312
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,099
Uh-- all right, JJ. I'm your man.

313
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,599
I know more about what makes a good picture

314
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,199
than any photographer in this town.
See, photography, it's not just about

315
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,599
-- no offense -- flagpoles. Whatever.

316
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,799
It's about lighting. Composition. Drama.

317
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,599
I want a staff job, sir.

318
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,799
I have a girl that I intend to marry, and--

319
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:52,799
I have this stupid little dream of-- working with one of the greatest newspaper editors of our time.

320
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,150
J. Jonah Jameson.

321
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,199
Well, we do have an opening.

322
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,399
-Johnson quit, remember?
- You fired him.
- Whatever.

323
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,799
Wait a minute. I know what makes a good picture,

324
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,799
and I've been here for a long time. If there's a staff job,

325
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,299
Mr Jameson, I think I deserve it.

326
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,999
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us for years.

327
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,399
He's done a great job.

328
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,299
You want a staff job, and you want a staff job.

329
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,299
Anybody care about what I want?

330
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,899
I do.
- Shut up. Get out.

331
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,699
I want the public to see Spider-Man for the two-bit criminal he really is.

332
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,699
He's a fake. He's full of stickum.

333
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,999
Catch him in the act.

334
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,299
"Spider-Man with his hand in the cookie jar".

335
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,399
Whoever brings me that photo gets the job.

336
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,799
What are you waiting for, Chinese New Year? Go, go, go!

337
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,599
I'm on it, boss.

338
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,199
You'll never get that shot.

339
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,350
We'll see.

340
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,899
You know,

341
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:58,350
I guess one person can make a difference.

342
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,050
'Nuff said.

343
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,099
Welcome home, Harry.

344
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,099
Thank God you're all right.

345
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,499
Thanks, Bernard.

346
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,050
-Aperitif?
- Sure.

347
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,399
Got you a little homecoming present.

348
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,299
-Wha-- It's your old ball!
- Yeah.

349
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,099
Thanks, buddy.

350
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,299
We were pretty good in the backyard, weren't we?

351
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,899
We were terrible. And we tried out for the varsity team.

352
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,899
-Yeah, for the cheerleaders.
- Right.

353
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,999
Hey, do I have any girlfriends?

354
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,499
-I don't know.
- You don't?

355
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:43,450
-Hey Bernard, do I have any girlfriends?
- Not that I know of, sir.

356
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,899
That's a pretty cool pass, huh?

357
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,199
It's OK.

358
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,599
Looks like I'm not worrying for money.

359
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,199
No.

360
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,150
Well, I bet I can turn this little girlfriend thing around.

361
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,599
You know,

362
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,799
he always appreciated how you helped me through high school.

363
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,450
I just wish I could remember more about him.

364
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:16,754
He loved you.

365
00:41:16,755 --> 00:41:20,299
That's the main thing.

366
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,299
Hey, let's watch the game in the kitchen.

367
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,450
- Get something to eat.
- OK.

368
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,850
Whoa, catch that!

369
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,099
Did you see that?

370
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,699
Still got the moves.

371
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,850
Yeah!

372
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,650
Why are you stopping?

373
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,950
What is she doing here?
Gary, you were supposed to call her agent.

374
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,499
Hi, honey.

375
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,899
We tried to reach you.

376
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,099
I'm sorry.

377
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,899
- One critic?
- No, all the papers, dear.

378
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:34,850
- Mary Jane, honey. Sit down. Let's explain it to you.
- If you like, we could say you became ill.

379
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,550
- That was so poorly handled.
- Yeah. Let's just rehearse.

380
00:42:56,843 --> 00:42:57,849
All right, Spidey!

381
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,099
Excuse me, miss. Let me see that gorgeous smile.

382
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,299
Hi, Eddie.

383
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,599
You're so beautiful.

384
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,299
This is front page stuff.

385
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,099
I've got to practice. I'll see you later, OK?

386
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,899
- How about tonight?
- Not tonight.

387
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,699
Why not?

388
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:58,199
Think of that amazing-- night that we had.

389
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,599
We had a coffee, Eddie.

390
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,999
Hey, beautiful.

391
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,250
One more.

392
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,999
- Everything OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

393
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,699
You're not still mad at me, are you?

394
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,199
No, Peter. I'm proud of you.

395
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,499
Hey. I'm gonna be swingin' it from over there.

396
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:21,999
So you know where to look.

397
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,999
Give 'em a good show.

398
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,599
Don't worry about that review.

399
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,399
We're gonna be laughing about it tomorrow night.

400
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,950
- Promise.
- Yeah.

401
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,699
Isn't that that guy from that prison break?

402
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,899
He fits.

403
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:55,650
Hey you! Halt!

404
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:59,102
Cover the back!

405
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,150
Fire!

406
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,199
People of the city of New York, I am here today

407
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,499
because I fell 62 storeys

408
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,299
and someone caught me.

409
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,850
Someone who never asks for anything in return.

410
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:45,851
Someone who doesn't even want us to know who he is.

411
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,599
- Hey, MJ.
- Harry.

412
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,799
Where is Pete?

413
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,899
Um-- taking somebody's picture, I guess.

414
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,299
I'm so happy to see you. You look so good.

415
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,999
I've never felt better.

416
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,599
It's a weird feeling, not knowing New York.

417
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,399
Bump on the head, I'm just free as a bird.

418
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,950
- Will you bump me on the head?
- Bop.

419
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,899
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.

420
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,599
You came. You sent me flowers.

421
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,999
I did?

422
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,499
I'll come again tonight.

423
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,099
You can't.

424
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,499
I--I was let go.

425
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,799
What happened.

426
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,599
I wasn't very good.

427
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,599
You know, this is embarrassing, but...

428
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,399
I once wrote you a play in high school.

429
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,999
You wrote me a play?

430
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,999
- Yeah.
- Harry, that's the sweetest thing.

431
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,999
I ask you: When you're dropping without a parachute

432
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,699
or your store's being robbed

433
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,599
or your house is on fire,

434
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:48,399
who is it that brakes your fall, puts out the flames and saves your children?

435
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,499
Spider-Man!

436
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,899
They love me!

437
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:57,299
Then let's hear it! For your one and only friendly neighborhood...

438
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,150
Spider-Man!

439
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,699
[crowd shouting]
<i> Kiss him! Kiss him!</i>

440
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,299
Go ahead, lay it right on me.

441
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,299
- Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.

442
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,899
<i> Kiss him! Kiss him!</i>
- No, Spider-Man, no!

443
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,150
Right...

444
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,150
Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.

445
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,450
- Hey, are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

446
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,199
Jig's up, pal.

447
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,599
I don't want to hurt you.

448
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,299
- Leave now.
- I guess you haven't heard?

449
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,399
I'm the sheriff 'round these parts.

450
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,650
OK.

451
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:40,050
Where do all these guys come from?

452
00:52:30,999 --> 00:52:31,999
Bonsoir. Le monsieur a-t-il un "reservation"?

453
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,650
- I'm sorry, I don't speak...
- But this is a French restaurant, non?

454
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:38,651
Oui.

455
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:44,550
- Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.

456
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,199
Ah. Here we are.

457
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,399
Table for two. <i>Pekar.</i>

458
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,899
- Parker.
- That is what I said.

459
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,650
<i>Pekar.</i>

460
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,799
Um, I have a request.

461
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,599
My girlfriend will be coming,

462
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,750
and I have this ring.

463
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,199
Ah. Allô.

464
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,299
Oh, so you want to pop the question tonight, hein?

465
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,399
Yes, and I want to do something very special.

466
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,699
I love it.

467
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,999
Romance.

468
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,750
I am French.

469
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,199
When I signal you, if you'd bring some champagne with the ring...

470
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,599
Inside bottom of her glass?

471
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,799
- Perfect.
<i>- Magnifique.</i>

472
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,299
Also I thought, at the same time

473
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,699
could the musicians

474
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:37,799
play this song?

475
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,099
<i>Their favorite.</i>

476
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:44,650
And take good care of the ring.
