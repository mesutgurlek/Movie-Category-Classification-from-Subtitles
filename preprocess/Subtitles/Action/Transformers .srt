1
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,200
<i>Before time began...</i>

2
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,500
<i>There was The Cube.</i>

3
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,800
<i>We know not where it comes from.
Only that it holds</i>

4
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:45,500
<i>the power to create worlds
and fill them with life.</i>

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>That is how our race was born.</i>

6
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,500
<i>For a time we lived in harmony.</i>

7
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,600
<i>But like all great power...</i>

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,400
<i>Some wanted it for good...</i>

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
<i>Others for evil.</i>

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,500
<i>And so began The War.</i>

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,700
<i>War that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death.</i>

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,800
<i>And The Cube was lost to
the far reaches of space.</i>

13
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,500
<i>We scattered across the galaxy,
hopeing to find it and rebuild our home.</i>

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,500
<i>Searching every star, every world...</i>

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,500
<i>And just when all hope seemed lost...</i>

16
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,800
<i>Passage of a new discovery
took us to an unknown planet called...</i>

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
<i>Earth.</i>

18
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,300
<i>But we were already too late...</i>

19
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,000
God 4 months of this...
Can't wait to get a little taste of home.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,900
Play with mama's aligators... - You've
been talking abut barbecued gators

21
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:08,900
and crickets for the last 2 weeks.
I'm never going to your mama's hose, I promise.

22
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:12,000
Bobby, gators are known to have
the most sucklear meat.

23
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,801
I understand.

24
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,300
I mean how many times...
We don't speak spanish.

25
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,000
That's my herritage..

26
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,400
You guys remember weekends?

27
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,500
Sox and Filmway, cold hotdog
and flat beer?

28
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:37,500
Perfect day...

29
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,800
What about you captain?
You got a perfect day?

30
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,800
I just can't wait to hold
my baby for the first time.

31
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,600
Watch this crossover man,
like Jordan in his prime...

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,500
Step asside mates.

33
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
- Hey, what are you doing?

34
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,000
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

35
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,100
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator.

36
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,000
10 miles out.

37
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,300
Unidentified aircraft, you are
obstircting US military airspace.

38
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:52,500
and proceed East out of the area.

39
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,200
Raptors 1 and 2, snap to
heading 250 and intercept.

40
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:00,900
Bogie is in the weeds,
10 miles out, not responding.

41
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,600
Unidentified aircraft, we'll
escort you to US SOX airbase.

42
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:14,000
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.

43
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,300
We got 10 on the bogie.
Tail 4500X.

44
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,400
Sir it says here 4500X
was shot down 3 months ago.

45
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:25,800
Afghanistan. - That's gotta be
a mistake, check again and recheck.

46
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:28,700
I did sir. Friend of mine
was on that chopper.

47
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,700
Where's the inbound?
- Bogie's 5 miles out sir.

48
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,000
Hi my ladies!

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh my goodnes, look at her,
she's getting so big.

50
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,800
Baby we've got a
good looking kid.

51
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:57,000
I know that people say
that all the time...

52
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:59,500
We made one good looking
kid. Nice work.

53
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:02,300
Sha has your laugh.
- She laughs?

54
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,200
Her first one.

55
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,100
Are you sure she
didn't just fart?

56
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,200
No, she's a lady.

57
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,500
She doesn't know you
yet, but she will.

58
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,400
4500X, something's not right.

59
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,300
Radar's jamed.

60
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,900
It's coming from the chopper.

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Sarah if you can hear me
I love you and I'll be home soon.

62
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,500
FX53 pilot, power down now.

63
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,700
Have your crew step
out or we will kill you.

64
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,800
My God...

65
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,500
They bombed that tower!
We're under attack!

66
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,600
They're going after the files!
Cut the hard lines!

67
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,601
I need a key, it's locked!

68
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,500
Ok, mr. Witwicky you're up.

69
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,900
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

70
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,000
Who did that?

71
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,000
People...
Responsibility.

72
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,700
So, for my family geneology
report, I decided to do it

73
00:08:57,701 --> 00:08:59,600
On my great great grandfather.

74
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,000
Who was a famous man.
Captain Archibald Witwicky.

75
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,000
Very famous explorer,
infact he was one of the first

76
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:07,900
to explore...

77
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,900
The arctic circle,
which is a big deal.

78
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,200
In 1897. he took 41 brave
sailors straight in to the arctic shelf.

79
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,200
The ice is freezing faster
than is melting!

80
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:28,000
Chop faster!

81
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,700
No sacrifice, no victory!

82
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:36,100
We'll get to the
arctic circle lads!

83
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,300
So that's the story.

84
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,800
And here we have some
of the basic instruments and tools

85
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:43,600
used by 19th century seamen.

86
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This here is the quadrant,
which should be arround 80 bucks.

87
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:49,700
It's all for sale by the way.
Like the sextant here.

88
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,000
50 dollars for this,
this is a bargain.

89
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,400
Theese are pretty cool.
Theese are my grandfather's glasses.

90
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,400
Haven't quite gotten them appraised yet,
but they've seen many cool things.

91
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:00,500
Are you going to sell
me his liver?

92
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,800
Mr. Witwicky this isn't
show and sell.

93
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,600
This is the 11th grade, I don't
think your grandfather would be

94
00:10:04,601 --> 00:10:06,900
particulary proud of what
you're doing. - I know, I'm sorry.

95
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:09,200
This all is going to
my car fund.

96
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:13,000
You tell your folks, it's on eBay.
I take PayPal, cold hard cash works too.

97
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:15,400
Compas makes a great gift for Columbo's day.

98
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,700
Unfortunately, my great great
grandfather, the genius that he was...

99
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,400
Wound up going blind
and crazy on a sych ward.

100
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:25,700
Drawing theese strange
symbols, babling on about some...

101
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Giant ice man that he
thought he saw...

102
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,700
OK, might be a pop
quiz tomorrow, might not!

103
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,800
Sleep in fear tonight.

104
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Pretty good right?

105
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,500
I'd say a solid B minus.

106
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,500
A B minus?
- You were hacking yor

107
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:50,100
great grandfather's
crap in my classrom.

108
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,200
Can you do me a favour? Can you look out
the window for a second and see my father?

109
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,300
He's the guy in the green car.

110
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:58,900
I'll tell you about a dream,
a boy's dream.

111
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,500
And a man's promice to that boy.

112
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:03,300
He looked him in the eyes and
said: "Son, I'm, gonna buy you a car."

113
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:05,600
But I want you to bring me
2000$ and 3 A's.

114
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,000
I got the 2000 and 2 A's.

115
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,600
Here's the dream.
Your B minus... dream gone.

116
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,400
Sir just ask yourself...

117
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What would Jesus do?

118
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,900
A minus.

119
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:25,500
Wait, I can't see.
It's an A.

120
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,200
So I'm good?
- You're good.

121
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,200
I got a little surprise
for you son.

122
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:33,800
What kind of surprise?
- Little surprise.

123
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,200
You gotta be kidding me!
- Yeah, I am.

124
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,201
You're not getting a Porsche.

125
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,200
You think that's funny?
- Yea I think it's funny.

126
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:52,000
What's wrong with you?
- Did you think I'd get you a porsche?

127
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,400
For your first car? - I don't want to
talk to you for the rest of my life.

128
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
C'mon it's just a car.
- It's no funny joke.

129
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,800
Get your cousin out of that damn
clown sute, he's having a heat stroke again.

130
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,300
Scarrying away folks.
- I'm hot, makeup's melting, hurts my eyes.

131
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:15,100
Here? No, no, no what is this?
- You said half of car not half of peace of crap.

132
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,300
When I was your age I'd
be happy with 4 wheels and an engine.

133
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:20,700
Let me explain something to you.
You ever seen "40 year old virgin"?

134
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,300
That's what this is,
and this is 50 year old virgin.

135
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,200
You want me to live that life?
- No sacrifice...

136
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:29,400
No victory, yeah i got it.
The old Witwicky moto.

137
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,300
Gentlemen.

138
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,900
Bobby Bolivia, like the country
except without the runks.

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,800
How can I help? - Well my
son here is looking to buy his first car.

140
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,700
You come to see me?
- Had to.

141
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:46,100
That practically makes us familly.
Uncle Bobby B baby.

142
00:12:46,101 --> 00:12:48,300
Uncle Bobby B.
- Sam.

143
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,200
Let me talk to you.

144
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:52,700
Sam, your first enchilada
of freedom...

145
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,900
Awaits underneeth one of those hoods.

146
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,900
Let me tell you something son.
A driver don's pick a car.

147
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,600
A car picks the driver.

148
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,300
Some mystical bond between
a man and a machine.

149
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:06,200
Son I'm a lot of things,
liar is not one of them.

150
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,300
Especially not in front
of my mammy.

151
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,200
That's my mammy.

152
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,100
Don't be like that...
If I had a rock I'd bust your ass bitch.

153
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:17,900
She's deaf, you know.

154
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,000
Over here... every piece
of car man might want or need.

155
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,300
So it's got racing stripes.
- Yeah, it's got racing...

156
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,200
What the heck is this?
I know nothing about this car.

157
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:37,500
Manny!
- What?

158
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:40,200
What is this?
This car, check it out.

159
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:42,500
I don't know boss.
I've never seen that.

160
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,900
Feels good.

161
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,100
How much?
- Well...

162
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,400
Considering the semi classic
nature of the vehicle...

163
00:13:56,401 --> 00:13:59,900
With the slick wheel and a
custom paint job... - But the paint's faded.

164
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Yeah, but it's custom.
- It's custom faded?

165
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,900
Well it is your first car
and I don't expect you to understand.

166
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,500
5 grand.
- No, I'm not paying over 4. Sorry.

167
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,400
Kid, c'mon get out of the car.
- No, you said cars pick their drivers.

168
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:15,500
Sometimes it picks a driver
with a cheap ass father, out of the car.

169
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,600
There's a fiesta with racing stripes over there.
- No, I don't wanna a fiesta with racing stripes.

170
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:28,700
This is a classic engine right here.
I sold a car the oder day...

171
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,400
Manny get your clown cousin and get
some hammers and come bang this stuff out baby!

172
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,500
That one's my favourite.
It drove all the way from Alabama.

173
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
4 thousand.

174
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Hello Mr. secretary.

175
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,800
They're so young.
-They are top subject matter experts sir.

176
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,000
NSA is recruiting right out
of high schools theese days.

177
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:35,500
Guys, that's the secretary of defense.
- I', so underdressed.

178
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
secretary of defense.

179
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,100
Please be seated.

180
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,100
I'm John Keller.

181
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,800
Obviously you've wondered why
you are here, so theese are the facts.

182
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,800
At 19:00 local time yesterday.
Saxon forward operations base at Qatar was attacked.

183
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:57,900
So far as we know, there were no survivors.

184
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,300
The objective of the attack was
to hack our military network.

185
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,500
We're not sure exactly what they were after,
but we do know that they were cut off during the assault.

186
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,600
Which leads us to assume
they are going to try again.

187
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,400
No one has taken the
responsibility for the attack.

188
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,500
And the only real lead
we have so far...

189
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,900
Is this sound.

190
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,900
That's the signal
that hacked our network.

191
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,700
NSA is working at full capacity to analize
it and intercept further communications.

192
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:37,400
But we need your help
to find out who did this

193
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,300
You've all shown considerable ability
in the area of signals analisis.

194
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,500
We're on a hair trigger here people.

195
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,700
The president has dispatched battle
groups to the Arabian Gulf and the Yellow Sea.

196
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:51,300
This is a real

197
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,900
I will leave you to your officer in charge,
break up into teams and start your work.

198
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,300
Good luck to us all.

199
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,200
Got the car,
now I need a girl.

200
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,300
Any money to count
the girls would do.

201
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,400
0 bids.

202
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:16,401
Great, broke.

203
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,800
Come on MOjo,
you want your pain pill?

204
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,500
It's like clockwork.

205
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:35,400
I know you're wasting theese
things, so I better get you sleeping outside.

206
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,500
That's it for today.
No more.

207
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:39,600
Crackhead.

208
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,400
Ron this one is uneaven.
- Yea probably.

209
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,300
This one is bobbing.
- I'll take care of that.

210
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:49,000
Couldn't we have hired a professional?

211
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I do not like footprints on my grass.
- There's no footprints.

212
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:57,100
That's why I built my path.
So why don't you go from my grass on to my path.

213
00:17:57,101 --> 00:17:59,900
It's family grass dad.
- When you own your own grass you'll understand.

214
00:17:59,901 --> 00:18:03,600
This, I can't do it anymore.
You're putting girl jewlery on a boy dog.

215
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:06,100
He's got enugh self esteeme
issues cos he's a chiuaha.

216
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:09,500
That's his bling.
I wan't you home by 11 o' clock.

217
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,500
Yea allright.
- 11 o' clock.

218
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:14,000
Please, for the love of God
drive seafely.

219
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You are so cheap.

220
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:28,700
That's his first car.
It's suposed to be like that.

221
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,600
A this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.

222
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,800
Our bases worldwide are as
of now Defcon Delta.

223
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,500
Our highest readiness level.

224
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,900
We are dealing with a very effective weapon
system we that have not come across before.

225
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,600
Our prayers are with the families of the brave
men and women... - Daddy's going to be ok.

226
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,700
I've never seen a weapon
system like this.

227
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:04,200
Thermal shows this weird aura arround
the egzoskeleton like it's cloacked

228
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:06,100
by some kind of invisible force field.

229
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:08,500
That's impossible. There's no such thing
as invisible force fields

230
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:10,500
except in comic books
stuff, right?

231
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:13,400
Man I don't know. My momma, she
had a gift, you know.

232
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,000
She saw things.

233
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,400
That thing that attacked us...

234
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:20,401
I gotta feeling it ain't over.

235
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,500
How about you use those magical voodoo
powers and get us the hell outta here.

236
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:30,300
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.

237
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,100
It looked right at me.

238
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,200
We gotta get this thing back to the Pentagon right
away, they gotta know what we're dealing here.

239
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:41,900
Radio's fried.
I got no communication with Ariel.

240
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,800
How far do you live from here?
- Not far, just up that mountain.

241
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:47,500
Do you have a phone?
- Yes.

242
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:49,500
Allright, let's hit it.

243
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?

244
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,300
Of course Miles, it's a lake.
Public property.

245
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,700
Oh my God. Oh my Gdd, dude,
Mikaela is here.

246
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:05,300
Just don't do anything weird, allright?

247
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:07,100
I'm good right?
- Yeah, you're good.

248
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,500
Hey guys, check it out.

249
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,300
Hey bro, that car...
It's nice.

250
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
So what are you guys doing here?

251
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,000
We're here to climb this tree.

252
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,600
I see that, it looks fun.

253
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,200
I thought I reckognized you, you tried
out for the football team last year right?

254
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Let's go call your mum.

255
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,800
That wasn't like a real try out.
I was researching a book I was writing.

256
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,500
What's it about?
Sucking at sports?

257
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,700
No, it's about the link between brain
damage and football.

258
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
I tell you it's a good book,
your friends will love it.

259
00:20:57,901 --> 00:21:03,100
It's got mazes in it, little coloring
areas, sections, pop up pictures...

260
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:05,500
A lot of fun.
- That's funny.

261
00:21:13,701 --> 00:21:17,600
You gotta get off the tree right now.
Just, get off the tree right now please.

262
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
What are you doing?
- You said it's fun.

263
00:21:21,401 --> 00:21:24,000
All the chicks were watching...
- You're making me look like an idiot.

264
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:25,300
We both look like idiots.

265
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:28,700
How about you let me drive?
- No, this is not a toy.

266
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:31,200
Theese 22, I don't want you grind them.

267
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:33,700
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?

268
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,900
I can't even tell you how
much I'm not your little bunny.

269
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,900
You'll call me.

270
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,300
Hey what's wrong
with your radio?

271
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:57,300
I'm driving her home today.
- What?

272
00:21:57,301 --> 00:22:00,000
She's an evil jock concubine
man, let her hitchhike.

273
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:01,900
She lives 10 miles from here,
it's my only chance.

274
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:04,700
Try to understand me here.
- Ok, we'll put here in the back, I'll be quiet.

275
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:07,100
Did you say put her in the back?
Miles I'm not putting her in the back

276
00:22:07,101 --> 00:22:09,600
You gotta get out of my car right now.
What rules?

277
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:12,400
Bros before hoes.
- Miles, you gotta get out of my car.

278
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,300
You can't do this to me.
- You gotta get out of my car right now.

279
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,400
It's Sam...
Witwicky

280
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,900
Hope you're not stranded
or anything... Sure?

281
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:32,700
So listen, I was wondering if I
could ride you home...

282
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:36,200
I mean, give you a ride home,
in my car to your house.

283
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,500
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

284
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,600
You can talk down if you want,
it won't hurt my feelings.

285
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,600
I didn't mean here you,
I just mean here like

286
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:02,300
in this situation.

287
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,500
Same situation that I'm always in.
I don't know, I guess I just have a

288
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:11,300
weakness for hot guys, for tight
abs and big arms.

289
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Big arms?

290
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,700
There's couple of new additions in the car.

291
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:19,700
Like, I've just put in that
light there...

292
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,500
And that disco ball, light
reflects of the disco ball.

293
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,700
Are you new to school this year?
Is this your first year?

294
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,900
No, we've been in the same
school since first grade. - Really?

295
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,100
Do we have any classes together?
- Yeah, history...

296
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Language arts, math, science...
- Sam... Sam, yes...

297
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:51,000
Sam Wilckeky...

298
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,500
Witwicky... - I know,
I'm so sorry.

299
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:58,600
I just didn't reckognize you.
- That's understandable.

300
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,200
Just working out the cakes...

301
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,400
This radio is like...

302
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,200
Look this isn't something...

303
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,500
Look I wouldn't try this on you.

304
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,000
This is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.

305
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,100
I'm a friend of yours, I'm
not a romantic friend.

306
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:30,700
Romantic friends do this.
I mean, I'm not that friend.

307
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:32,500
I mean we...
I could be...

308
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,600
Just pop the hood.

309
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,000
Nice huders... You got hi res
double pump carborator...

310
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:46,500
That's pretty impressive Sam.

311
00:24:46,501 --> 00:24:50,400
Double pump? - It squirts
the fuel in so you can go faster.

312
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
I like to go faster.

313
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:58,300
It looks like your distributor cap
is a little loose.

314
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,100
How did you know that?

315
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:06,800
My dad, he was a real greasemonkey.
Tought me all about this.

316
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,600
I could take it all apart, clean it
put it back together.

317
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:11,900
That's weird, I just wouldn't
pay you for mechanical.

318
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,400
Well you know, I don't really
broadcast it. Guys don't like it

319
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:17,400
when you know more
about cars than they do.

320
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,400
Especially not Trent.
He hates it.

321
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,300
I'm cool with females
working on my engine.

322
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
I prefere it actualy.

323
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,500
Ok, you wanna fire it up for me?

324
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,500
I was thinking, if Trent is souch
a jerk, why do you hang out with him?

325
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,300
You know what, I'm gonna walk.

326
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,300
Good luck with your car.

327
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,500
Allright...
Walking's healthy...

328
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,100
C'mon, please...
Don't let her walk away...

329
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,900
Wait a second!

330
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,100
There it is.

331
00:26:23,101 --> 00:26:26,900
I had fun, so...
Thanks for listening.

332
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,000
You don't think I'm shallow?

333
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,400
I think... There's a lot
more than meets the eye...

334
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
With you.

335
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,000
Allright, I'll see you at school.

336
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,900
Stupid...
That was a stupid line.

337
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,400
I love my car.

338
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,500
Guys, I think the other team
figuered it out.

339
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,700
Iran. - This is way to smart
for Iranian scientists.

340
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,500
Think about it.
- What do you think?

341
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:34,600
Chineese? - No way, this
is nothing like what the chineese are using.

342
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,700
Mr. President? - Can you rangle me up
some ding dongs darling?

343
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,000
- Neprevedeni titl -

344
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:26,000
I'll be in storage.

345
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,500
Did you hear that?

346
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Are you getting this?
Like they are hacking the network again.

347
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,200
Oh my God, this is a direct
match to the signal in Qatar.

348
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:03,300
Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?

349
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,200
Yes you should.
- So I am.

350
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,000
Someone! They are hacking into
Air Force 1.

351
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:22,500
I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?

352
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:27,900
Streaming right now. - They are planting a virus and
stealing whole lot of data at the same time.

353
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,900
Code red, we have a breach.

354
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,600
You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?!

355
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:46,500
Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir, permission to take down the defence network.

356
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,000
Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.

357
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,000
Someone's tampered with
the mainframe.

358
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,900
I want our president
in our bunker.

359
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:51,500
And I don't want to discuss
a damn thing other till that becomes reality.

360
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:54,500
That's pur first priority,
that's our only priority right now.

361
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,000
Air Force 1 is on the ground.

362
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
That's my car!

363
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,700
Dad call the cops!

364
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,200
Where are you going with
my car buddy, where are you going?

365
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Hello 911 emergency?!
My car's been stolen!

366
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:32,800
I'm in pursuit, I need all units,
the whole squadron!

367
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:37,900
Bring everyone! Don't ask me questions,
my father is on a neighbourhood watch.

368
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,600
Oh my God...

369
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,900
My name is Sam Witwicky.
Whoever finds this, my cyr is alive.

370
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,800
These are my last words ever
I just want to say mom, dad I love you.

371
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:38,700
And if you find "Busty Beauties"
under my bed

372
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,701
it wasn't mine I'm holding it for Miles.

373
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,600
That's not true, it's mine
and uncle Charles gave it to me, I'm sorry.

374
00:34:44,601 --> 00:34:46,100
Mojo I love you.

375
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,300
Please don't kill me I'm sorry.

376
00:35:22,301 --> 00:35:24,300
Take the keys, I don't want to touch you.

377
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,500
Good you're here.
- Let me see the hands!

378
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,800
It's not me, the guy's inside.
- Shut up!

379
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:36,000
Walk towards the car.

380
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Put your head on the hood.

381
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,400
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network

382
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:57,100
which is what they've tried to do in Qatar
only this time it worked.

383
00:35:57,101 --> 00:35:58,900
What did they get?
- We still don't know.

384
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:00,500
Talk to me about the virus.

385
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:03,300
It's a spider bug virus.
We're not sure what it's going to do

386
00:36:03,301 --> 00:36:05,500
but it may cripple the system.
- Can westop it?

387
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:08,000
Every time we try an antivirus
it adapts and speeds up.

388
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,700
It's like it's not a virus anymore
it's become the system.

389
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:14,000
Obviously the first phase
of major attack against the US.

390
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:18,200
Only countries with this kind of
capability are Russia, North Korea maybe China.

391
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:20,400
I'm sorry, that's not correct.

392
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:22,400
Excuse me young lady I did not
see you standing there

393
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:25,400
You would be who?
- Just an analist that detected the hack.

394
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:27,600
Hold on, it was you?

395
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,900
You did it?
- Her team.

396
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:33,900
Sir I was trying to say...
They hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

397
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,000
Even a supercomputer with a brute
force attack would take 20 years to do that.

398
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:41,600
Maybe you can explain then how
our latest satellite imagery

399
00:36:41,601 --> 00:36:44,000
shows North Korea doubleing
its naval activities...

400
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,900
Maybe it's a precocion becouse
isn't that what we're doing?

401
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,000
Signal pattern is learning, it's evolving
on its own and you need to move past

402
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:55,600
furyair transfers and start
considering quantum mechanics.

403
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:58,000
There is nothing on Earth
that complex.

404
00:36:58,001 --> 00:37:01,400
What about an organism?
A living organism, maybe some kind of

405
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:04,600
DNA based computer...
I know that that sounds crazy...

406
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:06,600
That's enough.

407
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,700
We have 6 floors
working on this thing.

408
00:37:09,701 --> 00:37:12,300
Now if you can find proof to
back up your theory

409
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm going to be happy to
listen to you.

410
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,400
But if you don't put a
filter on your brain - mouth theme

411
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,600
you're going to off the team.
You understand?

412
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,100
I can't be any clearer,
on how crystal clear I am being.

413
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,900
It just stood up.
- Just stood up?

414
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,000
It's really neat.

415
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:37,500
Ok, time to fill her up.

416
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm not on any drugs.
- What's this?

417
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,500
Found it in your pocket.
Mojo...

418
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,300
Is that what you kids are doing now?

419
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:56,700
Those are my dog's pain pills.
- Yeah, chiuaha...

420
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
What was that?

421
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,900
You eyeballing my peace?

422
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,400
You wanna go?
Make something happen, do it.

423
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,300
Cos I promice you,
I will bust you up.

424
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,400
Are you on drugs?

425
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,300
Let's hope this
telephone line works.

426
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,700
What the heck was that?

427
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,800
English dude, english.

428
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
Where's your pappa?!

429
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,500
Sir I need a telephone...

430
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,000
This is an emergency Pentagon call...
Do you understand, this is an emergency...

431
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,800
I don't have a credit card!

432
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,300
Sir the attitude is not going to
speed things up, anything at all.

433
00:40:24,301 --> 00:40:27,500
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouth peace very clearly...

434
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:29,800
I'm in a middle of a war!

435
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:31,500
Pretty rediculos!

436
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,300
I need a credit card!

437
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,300
Where's your wallet?!
- Pocket!

438
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,700
Which pocket?
- My back pocket!

439
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,700
You don't have a back pocket!
- Left jink!

440
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,300
Also sir, have you heard about our
premium plus service call package?

441
00:40:58,301 --> 00:41:00,500
No I don't want a premium package!

442
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:10,600
Give me a status? - Sir we're tracking
a spec ops team under fire in Qatar.

443
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,500
They say they are survivors
at the base attack. - Survivors.

444
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,800
I've never seen this in my life!
Need gunships on station ASAP!

445
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:23,600
Predators coming up in a minute.
- Linking a call to the nearest AWAC

446
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,100
Man if you've seen this shit...
- Predator ETA 2 minutes.

447
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
What is that?

448
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,300
We need air support and we need it now.
Roll in strike package B on unknown target.

449
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,000
7 man team, north of
orange smoke!

450
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,200
Attack to Rich and Wess,
you're cleared hot!

451
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,200
The heat's coming!
- Laser target!

452
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:48,100
We got to beam light it for incoming!
Link target!

453
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,600
The heat's coming!

454
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,700
No freakin way!
That thing is still not down!

455
00:43:18,701 --> 00:43:21,800
Ok 32 use .105 shells.
Bring the rain.

456
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
<i>Be advised, ground team is
requesting .105 sable rounds.</i>

457
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,900
Did we loose it?
- Warthog 1 confirm visual on frendlies.

458
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,900
Where is Frank?

459
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,500
Get a medic!

460
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,200
Bring them home.

461
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,600
Get those men stateside right now.
I want them debriefed in 10 hrs.

462
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,600
There's only one hacker in the world
that can brake this code.

463
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,500
I'm sorry to bother you.
- Maggie...

464
00:44:57,501 --> 00:45:00,100
I need your help.
- No, this is my private area...

465
00:45:00,101 --> 00:45:06,200
my place of zen and peace.
Shut up grandma!

466
00:45:06,201 --> 00:45:08,400
What are you doing here?
- Just give me a break will you?

467
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:11,000
Grandma cut the proone juice!

468
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,400
What level are you on?
- Sixth...

469
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,500
Don't you want to
see somtehing classified?

470
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,800
I need a moment... please.
- Sorry.

471
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,600
And save my game.

472
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:44,800
How classified?

473
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,100
Like, I will go to jail for the rest
of my life for showing you classified.

474
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,600
One quick peak.

475
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Spec Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

476
00:45:56,001 --> 00:45:58,800
I wanna see it.
- The imager was damaged sir.

477
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:02,400
The rangers are in rout with
the imager, but we also have a security issue.

478
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:05,100
Server logs indicate one of the
analysts made a copy of the network

479
00:46:05,101 --> 00:46:06,900
intrusion signal.

480
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,700
The signal strength is through the roof,
where did you said you got this?

481
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:16,700
Hacked the national military
airguard frequency in less than a minute.

482
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:18,600
No way...

483
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,800
Looks like there's a message
embedded in the signal.

484
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,400
Gotta be worth my magic.

485
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,800
Project "Iceman"?
- What's Sector 7?

486
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,600
Who is captain Witwicky?

487
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:39,100
Are you playing those
videogames again?

488
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,200
Cops!

489
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,900
Get off my grandma's carpet!
She don't like nobody on her carpet!

490
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,200
Especially police!

491
00:47:03,201 --> 00:47:09,800
<i>It was an awesome spectacle here an hour
ago when over 40 C17's lifted off this very base.</i>

492
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,500
<i>We were not told where
they're going...</i>

493
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,000
Stop barking Mojo it's
too early please.

494
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,600
Miles listen to me.
My car, it stole itself ok?

495
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,100
What are you talking about man?
- Satan's Camaro in my yard.

496
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:35,000
It is stalking me.

497
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,800
Sam?

498
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,100
That was really...
Awesome.

499
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,900
It felt awesome.
- Are you ok?

500
00:48:03,901 --> 00:48:05,600
No I'm not ok, I'm loosing
my mind a little bit.

501
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:08,200
Getting chased by my car
right now, I gotta go.

502
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,600
You know what, I'm gonna
go, I'll check with you guys later.

503
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,800
Great, the cops.

504
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,900
Officer!

505
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,000
Listen...

506
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,200
That hurt.

507
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,100
Listen to me.
Thank God you're here.

508
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,300
I've had the worst day ever.
I've been followed here on my mother's bike.

509
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,600
And my car is right there
and it has been following me here.

510
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:11,500
So get out of the car.

511
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,700
Please, what do you want from me?!

512
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,100
This is a bad dream.

513
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,100
Are you username LadiesMan217?
- I don't know what you're talking about!

514
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:04,500
Are you username LadiesMan217?!
- Yeah...

515
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:08,500
Where is the eBay item 21153?!
Where are the glasses?!

516
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Get back!

517
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,700
What is your problem Sam?!
- There's a monster right there, it just attacked me!

518
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,100
Here it comes!

519
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,000
Sam what is that thing?
- You have to get in the car.

520
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:49,000
Get in the car.
Trust me!

521
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,600
We're gonna die!
- We're not gonna die!

522
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,300
We're locked in.

523
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:51,600
The car won't start.
Atleast we've ditched the monster, right?

524
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,200
He's gonna kill me!

525
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,300
Not so tough without
a head, are you?!

526
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,100
Come on.

527
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,700
What is it?

528
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,200
It's a robot.

529
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:33,700
Like a... different...
super advanced robot.

530
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,700
He's probably Japaneese.

531
00:54:37,701 --> 00:54:39,700
He's definetly Japaneese.

532
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
What are you doing?

533
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,700
I don't think he wants to hurt us.
He would have done that already.

534
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,600
Really? Well do you speak robot, because
they just had a giant twin deathmatch.

535
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,600
I think he wants something from me.
- What?

536
00:54:56,601 --> 00:54:59,400
Because the other one was
talking about my eBay page.

537
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,200
You're the strangest
boy I have ever met.

538
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,700
Can you talk?

539
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,500
So you talk through the radio?

540
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,300
So what was that last night?
What was that?

541
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,400
"Visitors from heaven"...
What?

542
00:55:24,401 --> 00:55:26,800
Are you like an alien or something?

543
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,500
Any more questions
you want to ask?

544
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,200
He wants us to get in the car.

545
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,500
And go where?

546
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,000
This car is a pretty
good driver.

547
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,700
Why don't you go sit
in that seat there?

548
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:25,000
I'm not gonna sit in his
seat, he's driving.

549
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,500
Maybe you should sit
in my lap. - Why?

550
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,700
I have the only seatbelt here,
safety first.

551
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,300
See, that's better.

552
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,800
You know, that seatbelt thing
was a pretty smooth move.

553
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,400
Thank you.

554
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,000
You know what I don't understand...

555
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,800
Why if he's suposed to be this
super advanced robot

556
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:08,300
does he transform back into
this piece of crap camaro?

557
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,900
Fantastic!
Now you've pissed him off!

558
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,500
That car is sensitive.
4000$ just drove off.

559
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,300
What?

560
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,700
This is easilly a hundred times
cooler than Armaggedon.

561
00:59:07,701 --> 00:59:09,800
I swear the God.

562
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,400
Sweet... Dude I hope this guy's got
assdrilling insurance cos he is so boned.

563
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,300
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

564
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,100
Hey sweetheart, what are
you doing out here by yourself?

565
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,200
Holy cow what happened
to the pool?

566
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,200
Are you Samuel James Witwicky
descendant of Archibald Witwicky?

567
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,100
He knew your name.
- Yeah...

568
01:02:07,101 --> 01:02:09,600
My name is Optimus Prime.

569
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:13,500
We are autonomus robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.

570
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,200
But you can call us Autobots for short.

571
01:02:16,201 --> 01:02:17,600
Autobots?

572
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:20,500
What's crackin little bitches?
- My first liutenant...

573
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,700
Jazz... - This looks like a
cool place to kick it.

574
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,800
How did he learn to talk like that?

575
01:02:28,801 --> 01:02:32,400
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.

576
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,700
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

577
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,900
You feeling lucky punk?
- Easy Ironhide.

578
01:02:40,901 --> 01:02:43,700
Just kidding, I just wanted
to show him my talents.

579
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,600
Our medical officer Ratchett.

580
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:51,500
The boy's pheromone levels suggest
he wants to mate with the female.

581
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,700
You already know your
guardian Bumblebee.

582
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,900
You're my guardian?

583
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:08,700
His vocal processor was damaged in battle.
We've been still working on him.

584
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,000
Why are you here?
- We are here looking for the Allspark.

585
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,900
And we must find it
before Megatron.

586
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,000
Mega what?

587
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,100
Our planet was once
a powerful empire.

588
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,300
Peaceful and just.

589
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:43,000
Until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.

590
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,500
All that were to fight
them were destroyed.

591
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:53,700
Our war finally consumed the planet
and the Allspark was lost to the stars.

592
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,300
Megatron followed it to Earth.

593
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,000
When captain Witwicky found him.

594
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,000
My grandfather...

595
01:04:03,001 --> 01:04:07,300
It was an accident that
intertwined our fates.

596
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,500
Come back!

597
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,000
The dogs have found something.

598
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,600
The ice is cracking.

599
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,000
I'm allright lads!

600
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,900
Megatron crashlanded before
he could retrieve The Cube.

601
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Men, we've made a discovery!

602
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:02,000
He accidentaly activated
his navigation system.

603
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,000
The coordinates to The Cube's
location on Earth

604
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:22,000
were imprinted on his glasses.

605
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,100
How did you know
about his glasses?

606
01:05:24,101 --> 01:05:26,200
eBay...

607
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:29,600
If the Decepticons find the Allspark...

608
01:05:29,601 --> 01:05:33,300
They will use it's power to
transform Earth's machines

609
01:05:33,301 --> 01:05:38,400
and build a new army.
- And the human race will be extiguished.

610
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,100
Sam Witwicky, you hold
the key to Earth's survival.

611
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:50,000
Please tell me that
you have those glasses.

612
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,600
It's like a self regenerating
molecular armor.

613
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:00,000
Look at the scorch mark
where the Sable round hit.

614
01:06:00,001 --> 01:06:01,600
Melted right through.

615
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:04,800
Aren't Sables hot loaded for
like a 6000 degree magnesium burn?

616
01:06:04,801 --> 01:06:06,900
Close to it, that was tank armor.

617
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:09,200
This metal skin must
react to extreme heat...

618
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,600
I thought you said
that thing was dead man!

619
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,400
Strap it down!
Strap it!

620
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,400
This thing is wicked!

621
01:06:19,401 --> 01:06:21,700
Get on a hornet northern command,
tell them that our effective weapon

622
01:06:21,701 --> 01:06:24,701
is high heat Sable rounds.
Recommend we load them on all gunships, go.

623
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,500
You want that peace?
Ok Maggie look.

624
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,800
They're gonna come through
that door, play good cop bad cop.

625
01:06:36,801 --> 01:06:38,800
Don't fall for that, allright?

626
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,400
That's why I ate their food.

627
01:06:40,401 --> 01:06:42,600
They put the plate of donuts
here to test your guilt.

628
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,100
If you don't touch it you're guilty.

629
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,300
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate.

630
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:53,000
It's me and you. They walk
through that door, you don't say nothing.

631
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,300
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want!

632
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:13,400
I was just sitting home watching
cartoons, playing videogames with my cousin

633
01:07:13,401 --> 01:07:15,700
and she came in there, allright?
- Glenn you freak!

634
01:07:15,701 --> 01:07:17,600
I am not going to jail
for you or anybody else.

635
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:20,100
I have done nothing bad
my entire life.

636
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,900
Hey man, I'm still a virgin.

637
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:25,600
So what, i've downloaded a
couple of thousand songs off the internet

638
01:07:25,601 --> 01:07:27,600
who hasen't?!

639
01:07:27,601 --> 01:07:29,800
Glenn sut up!
- No, you shut up!

640
01:07:29,801 --> 01:07:32,300
Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me criminal!

641
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,800
Sugar rush.
- This is not his fault.

642
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,000
Can I go home now?

643
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,000
Just listen to me.

644
01:07:41,001 --> 01:07:44,400
Whoever hacked into your
military system, downloaded a file.

645
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,100
It was something about
someone named Witwicky...

646
01:07:47,101 --> 01:07:50,600
And some goverment group
named Sector 7.

647
01:07:50,601 --> 01:07:54,900
You have to let me talk to defense secretary
Keller before you go to war with the wrong country.

648
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,300
What did he say?
Did he hear it too?

649
01:08:00,301 --> 01:08:02,000
Jack heard it too.
- What does he think it is?

650
01:08:02,001 --> 01:08:03,600
He thinks it's a military experiment.

651
01:08:03,601 --> 01:08:05,400
Well I think it's a plane.

652
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,500
Call Sam, he should be
home in 15 minutes.

653
01:08:15,501 --> 01:08:18,400
Well I'll call him in 15 minutes.
- If you wait 15 minutes he'll be late

654
01:08:18,401 --> 01:08:21,201
and you'll have to ground him.
- I can't ground him if he's not late, can I?

655
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,200
Just stay here, allright?
You have to stay here and watch them.

656
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,800
You hear what I'm saying?
5 minutes, allright?

657
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,900
Thanks for staying on my path.

658
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Oh the path, I'm sorry I
forgot about the path.

659
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:39,800
I'm gonna sweep the whole
thing right now, how about that?

660
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,700
I buy half of your car,
I bail you out of jail,

661
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:45,300
and then I just decided to
do all your chors.

662
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,900
Life is great.
- Life is fantastic, that's how good it is.

663
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,100
The trash can, sorry dad,
I'm gonna do the trash cans, allright?

664
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:54,600
No, I don't want you
to strain yourself.

665
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,200
Dad, you'll hurt my feelings
if you do it.

666
01:08:57,201 --> 01:08:59,900
I promise... No, no, I'm gonna do it.

667
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:03,500
I'm gonna do the trash cans and I'm gonna
scrape the grill and I'm gonna...

668
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:06,200
Sweep up the whole house
right now.

669
01:09:06,201 --> 01:09:09,800
Right now?
- Right now.

670
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,700
I love you.
God I love you.

671
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,300
Just so much right now.
- You know, your mom wanted me to ground you.

672
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:19,101
You're 3 minutes late.

673
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:22,500
Just another thing you did for me
dad, because you're such a swell guy.

674
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:26,200
Allright, I love you.
Sleep good handsome man.

675
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,000
What are you doing?

676
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:30,700
Watch the path!

677
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,900
Sorry, my bad.

678
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,500
You couldn't wait
for 5 minutes, I told you to stay.

679
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:49,000
I told you...
- Ok, they are in a little bit of a rush.

680
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,500
Mojo no!

681
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,400
Mojo off the robot.
God.

682
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,900
This is Mojo, he's a pet of
mine, he is a pet.

683
01:10:01,901 --> 01:10:04,000
That's all.

684
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:05,800
Put the guns away,
put them away.

685
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:08,900
You have a rodent infestation,
shall I terminate?

686
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,000
He's not a rodent, he is a chiuaha.
This is my chiuaha.

687
01:10:12,001 --> 01:10:17,000
We love chiuahas don't we?
-He has leaked lubricants all over my foot.

688
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,600
He pied on you?
Bad Mojo!

689
01:10:21,601 --> 01:10:24,900
Bad Mojo!

690
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,900
It's gonna rust.

691
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,600
Just hurry

692
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,500
Autobots recon.

693
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:47,300
He's in the kitchen, I had to
slap him arround.

694
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,500
You did not.

695
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,400
You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.

696
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,100
Time is short.
- They really want those glasses.

697
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,400
Please hurry.

698
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,000
No, no, it's definetly gone.
- What do you mean?

699
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:20,800
Glasses were in the bag, they were
in the backpack, now the backpack isn't here.

700
01:11:20,801 --> 01:11:22,600
Well they're gonna be
pissed, so what do you want to do?

701
01:11:22,601 --> 01:11:25,000
What I think you should do,
you should check this whole

702
01:11:25,001 --> 01:11:27,100
this whole section here.
Give it a clean sweep.

703
01:11:27,101 --> 01:11:28,800
And I'll get the corner here.

704
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,000
Not there, that's my private.
Sorry.

705
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,700
You just told me... - I didn't mean to
look inside of my treasure chest.

706
01:11:35,701 --> 01:11:37,300
You should be way more specific...

707
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,800
This isn't hiding.
This isn't hiding.

708
01:11:49,801 --> 01:11:51,600
This is my back yard,
not a truck stop.

709
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,500
<i>I saw it. UFO landed
right here and now is gone.</i>

710
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,700
<i>My moped is under there
man, who's gonna pay for that?</i>

711
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,500
Sam he's back.
Ok I'll deal with this.

712
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,400
What?! No, no, no
these are my mother's flowers.

713
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,700
Listen, you gotta listen to me.
If my parents come out here

714
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:13,000
and they see you, they're gonna
freak out. My mom's got a temper.

715
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,200
We must have the glasses.
- I know you need the glasses.

716
01:12:16,201 --> 01:12:18,900
I've been looking everywhere,
they're not here, they're definetly not here.

717
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,500
Keep searching.
- I need you to be quiet for 5 minutes.

718
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:26,400
Please, I'm begging you.
I can't concentrate.

719
01:12:26,401 --> 01:12:28,500
You want me to look...
- Calm down.

720
01:12:28,501 --> 01:12:30,300
You gotta do something.

721
01:12:30,301 --> 01:12:33,000
Autobots, fall back.
- Please for 5 minutes.

722
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:38,100
Move! - What's the matter
with you, can't you be quiet?

723
01:12:38,101 --> 01:12:39,900
He wants us to be quiet...

724
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,800
Earthquake! Move, move,
move, earthquake!

725
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,500
Judy get under the table,
move it!

726
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,300
Duck and cover right now!
- How did you get over there so fast?

727
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,800
That was tingleing.

728
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,000
Yeah, that looks fun.

729
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,500
What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

730
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,700
That's weird.

731
01:13:14,701 --> 01:13:17,200
Ratchett point the light.
- Come on, hurry.

732
01:13:17,201 --> 01:13:19,000
We've got a major issue here.
What's with the light?

733
01:13:19,001 --> 01:13:21,600
You got to stop the light.
You got to tell him to shut...

734
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:23,800
Sam are you in there?
How come the door's locked?

735
01:13:23,801 --> 01:13:26,900
You know the rules,
no doors locked in my house.

736
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,300
You know he'll start counting if
you don't open... - One more chance.

737
01:13:30,301 --> 01:13:32,000
Oh dear.
- 5... 4...

738
01:13:32,001 --> 01:13:33,500
Sam he's counting.
- It's coming of the hinge pal.

739
01:13:33,501 --> 01:13:36,000
Sam just open the door.
- 3... 2...

740
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,300
What's up?
What's with the bat?

741
01:13:40,301 --> 01:13:42,200
Who were you talking to?

742
01:13:42,201 --> 01:13:45,100
I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

743
01:13:45,101 --> 01:13:48,700
I'm a child, teenager.
- We heard voices and noises...

744
01:13:48,701 --> 01:13:50,400
We thought maybe...
- It doesn't matter what we thought.

745
01:13:50,401 --> 01:13:52,000
What was that light?
- What light?

746
01:13:52,001 --> 01:13:54,000
There's no light, you've
got 2 lights in your hand.

747
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:58,200
You can't just bounce into
my room like that.

748
01:13:58,201 --> 01:13:59,800
You got to knock,
you got to comunicate.

749
01:13:59,801 --> 01:14:01,700
We did, we knocked...
- We knocked!

750
01:14:01,701 --> 01:14:03,600
You didn't knock, you were
screaming at me.

751
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,500
This is repressioning what you're
doing here, you're ruining my youth.

752
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:09,300
Oh for Pete's sakes,
you are so defensive.

753
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,900
Were you masturbating?

754
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Judy...
- Was I... No mum!

755
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,800
I don't masturbate.
- That's not something for you to bring up.

756
01:14:18,801 --> 01:14:21,000
That's a father and son thing.
- Father and son thing.

757
01:14:21,001 --> 01:14:23,400
We don't have to call it that word if
that makes you unconformtable.

758
01:14:23,401 --> 01:14:26,700
You can call it "Sam's happy time".

759
01:14:26,701 --> 01:14:31,500
Or "My special alone time".
- Stop, Judy stop.

760
01:14:31,501 --> 01:14:35,000
I'm sorry, it's just been a weird
night, I had a little bit to drink.

761
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,400
Well we saw a light.
- Parents.

762
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:41,800
Whatever it was, but we saw it.

763
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,500
Earthquake, another one!
Get in the doorway!

764
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,200
Aftershock, aftershock.

765
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:52,900
God I hate these.
- Quick hide!

766
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:02,700
Oh no, look at the yard,
the yard is destroyed.

767
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,100
Judy better call the city,
we've got a blown transformer.

768
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,600
Power pole's sparkling all over the place...

769
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:18,400
Oh man, the yard's a waste.
Crashed, gone.

770
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,500
The parents are wery iritating.
Can I take them out?

771
01:15:23,501 --> 01:15:27,700
Ironhide you know we don't
harm humans. What is with you?

772
01:15:27,701 --> 01:15:31,500
Well I'm just saying we could.

773
01:15:31,501 --> 01:15:34,100
We heard you talking to somebody
Sam, we want to know who.

774
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:37,700
Hi, I'm Mikaela.

775
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:40,400
I'm a friend of Sam's.

776
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,800
Gosh, you're gorgeous.

777
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,700
She can hear you talking mom.
- Thank you.

778
01:15:47,701 --> 01:15:50,800
Oh my godness, I'm sorry
you had to hear our little family discussion.

779
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:54,500
Where's my backpack mom?
- It's in the kitchen.

780
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Your mom's so nice.

781
01:16:16,001 --> 01:16:19,500
I want you to distract my parents
while I sneak out theese glasses.

782
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:28,100
Ronald Wickedy?
- Witwicky, who are you?

783
01:16:28,101 --> 01:16:30,000
The goverment, sector 7.

784
01:16:30,001 --> 01:16:31,800
Never heard of it.
- Never will.

785
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,000
Your son is a grat grandson
of captain Archibald Wickedy, is he not?

786
01:16:35,001 --> 01:16:36,400
It's Witwicky.

787
01:16:36,401 --> 01:16:39,500
May I enter the premesis sir?

788
01:16:39,501 --> 01:16:42,300
Ron there's guys all
over the front yard.

789
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,800
What the heck's going on here?
- Your son filed a stolen car report last night

790
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:48,100
we think it's envolved in a
national security matter.

791
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,000
National security?
- That's right, national security.

792
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:54,600
My God Ron, they're everywhere.
There's guys in suits all arround the house

793
01:16:54,601 --> 01:16:56,700
Look at this!
- Would you stay off the grass?!

794
01:16:56,701 --> 01:16:59,700
Get me a sample and some
isotope readings.

795
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,400
They gotta get their
hands off my bush.

796
01:17:03,401 --> 01:17:06,300
Drop the bat ma'am,
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

797
01:17:06,301 --> 01:17:10,100
You better get those guys out of my garden
or I'm gonna beat the crap out of them.

798
01:17:10,101 --> 01:17:13,500
Are you experiencing any
flue like simptoms? - Ne!

799
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,500
What is this?
- How you doing son!

800
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:18,600
Is your name Sam?
- Yeah...

801
01:17:18,601 --> 01:17:21,100
I need you to come with us...
- You're way out of line!

802
01:17:21,101 --> 01:17:25,100
Sir I am asking politely.
Back off.

803
01:17:25,101 --> 01:17:27,000
You're not taking my son.
- Really?

804
01:17:27,001 --> 01:17:29,600
You're gonna try to get ruf with us?
- No but I'm gonna call the cops.

805
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:32,100
Because there's something
fishy going on arround here.

806
01:17:32,101 --> 01:17:35,800
There's something a little fishy
about you, your son and your little taco bel dog

807
01:17:35,801 --> 01:17:37,800
and this whole operation
you've got going on here.

808
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,800
What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.

809
01:17:40,801 --> 01:17:43,700
I think, direct contact.

810
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,100
Step forward please.

811
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,300
14 rads...

812
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,800
Bingo!
Tag'em and bag'em!

813
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:07,600
You hurt my dog
I'll kick your ass.

814
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,100
Sam do not say anything!

815
01:18:11,101 --> 01:18:12,700
Not a word until we get a lawyer.

816
01:18:12,701 --> 01:18:18,800
So... LadiesMan217...

817
01:18:18,801 --> 01:18:21,800
That is your eBay username right?

818
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,900
Yeah but it was a tipo,
then I ran with it.

819
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:26,700
What do you make of this?

820
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,600
Is that you?
- Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

821
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,500
Last night at the station you
told the officer your car "transformed"...

822
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,800
Enlighten me.
- Here's what I said.

823
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:44,400
This is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen.

824
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,300
Really?
- From me, from my home

825
01:18:47,301 --> 01:18:49,500
but it's fine now
because it's back, it came back.

826
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:52,000
Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.

827
01:18:52,001 --> 01:18:54,800
Because cars don't do that,
because that would be crazy.

828
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:03,000
What do you kids know
about the aliens?

829
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,200
You mean like a martian?
ET?

830
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,500
It's an urban legend.
- You see this?

831
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,900
This is I can do whatever I want
and get away with it badge.

832
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,000
I'm gonna lock you up forever.

833
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:16,900
Oh God, you know what don't
listen to him he's just pissed 

834
01:19:16,901 --> 01:19:18,800
because he's gotta get
back to guarding the mall.

835
01:19:18,801 --> 01:19:21,800
You in the train broad.
Do not test me.

836
01:19:21,801 --> 01:19:24,200
Especialy when your
daddy's parrol coming up.

837
01:19:24,201 --> 01:19:25,700
What?
Parrol?

838
01:19:25,701 --> 01:19:28,000
It's nothing...
- A grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

839
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,300
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix...

840
01:19:31,301 --> 01:19:34,100
Well they weren't always his.
- You stole cars?

841
01:19:34,101 --> 01:19:37,700
We couldn't alwys afford a babysitter
so sometimes he had to take me along.

842
01:19:37,701 --> 01:19:40,200
She's got her own jouvie
record to prove it.

843
01:19:40,201 --> 01:19:43,000
She's a criminal.
Criminals are hot.

844
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,000
It would be a real shame
if he had to rot in jail

845
01:19:47,001 --> 01:19:48,700
rest of his natural life.

846
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:51,300
It is time to talk.

847
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,000
You're in trouble now.

848
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,800
Gentlemen...

849
01:20:28,801 --> 01:20:31,200
I wanna introduce you
to my friend.

850
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:34,500
Optimus Prime.

851
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:39,500
Taking the children
was a bad move.

852
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,300
Autobots, relieve them
of their weapons.

853
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,500
Give me those!

854
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,500
Hi there...

855
01:21:06,501 --> 01:21:11,000
You don't seem affraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?

856
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,500
There are S-7 protocols.

857
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,100
I'm not authorised to communicate
with you except to tell you

858
01:21:19,101 --> 01:21:22,800
I can't communicate with you.
- Get out of the car!

859
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,600
Me?
- Now!

860
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,300
I'm getting out, you see?

861
01:21:30,301 --> 01:21:34,100
Wery nifty how you put
us down without really killing us.

862
01:21:34,101 --> 01:21:36,200
You're good with handcuffs too now?

863
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,300
You weren't suposed to
hear all that.

864
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:47,000
Sam, I have a record because
I woulnd't turn my dad and...

865
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:51,900
When did you have to sacrifice anything
in your perfect little life?

866
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,700
Big guys with big guns.

867
01:21:55,701 --> 01:21:58,700
What is Sector-7?
Answer me!

868
01:21:58,701 --> 01:22:01,300
I'm the one asks questions
arround here, not you young man!

869
01:22:01,301 --> 01:22:03,500
How did you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?

870
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:07,400
I am not at liberty to discuss...
Hey you touch me that's a federal offense.

871
01:22:07,401 --> 01:22:09,400
Do whatever you want,
get away with the badge, right?

872
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,500
Brave now all of a sudden
with his big alien friends standing over there.

873
01:22:12,501 --> 01:22:14,500
Where is Sector-7?
- Wouldn't you like to know.

874
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,000
Bumblebee, stop lubricating
the man.

875
01:22:25,001 --> 01:22:26,900
Get that thing to stop!

876
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:31,000
Ok tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?

877
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:34,500
Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?

878
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,200
For threathening my dad.

879
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,300
Little lady...

880
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,200
This is the beginning...

881
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,200
Of the end of your life.

882
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:50,200
You're a criminal.

883
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:53,100
Let's face facts, it's in your gene pool.

884
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:55,700
Those are nice.

885
01:22:56,200 --> 01:23:00,000
Now get behind the pole.
- This is souch a felony that you're doing.

886
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,600
I will hunt you down.
- Hunt you down.

887
01:23:04,601 --> 01:23:07,000
Without any remorse.
- No remorse.

888
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,800
We've got to alert everyone.
- They already know.

889
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,800
Speaker.

890
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Incoming.

891
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,400
Roll out!

892
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:00,400
Easy you two.

893
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:10,700
Get down on the gorund!
Get down!

894
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:17,400
Look he's not fiting back!

895
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,500
Happy to see me again?

896
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:14,100
Put him in the car with his
little criminal friend.

897
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,900
I want that thing prepd
and ready for transport!

898
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,700
Optimus...

899
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,300
Are we just gonna
stand here and do nothing?

900
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,100
There's no way to free
Bumblebee without harming the humans.

901
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,800
But it's not right...
- Let them leave.

902
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,200
Chineese and Russians are nearing
our area of operations in the western Pacifik.

903
01:28:05,201 --> 01:28:07,500
We feel like this could
get out of hand real fast.

904
01:28:07,501 --> 01:28:11,000
In the next couple of
hours they justifed his present

905
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:18,500
US and Chineese task forces
are approaching 100 miles crouse missle range.

906
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,300
Tell the strike group commander
that he's not to engage unless fired on first.

907
01:28:22,301 --> 01:28:24,400
Yes sir.
- Mr. secretary...

908
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:31,200
Tom Banachek. I'm with sector-7,
advanced research division.

909
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,900
Never heard of it, I'm a little
busy Tom, I think you can see that.

910
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,500
Talk to me!
- The whole room's going down sir.

911
01:28:48,501 --> 01:28:51,200
I can see that.
- Virus was coded to shut us down.

912
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,600
I'll take a seat.

913
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,200
What do you mean shut us down?
- Then used our network to spread

914
01:28:57,201 --> 01:29:00,100
out to the whole world.
The blackout's global.

915
01:29:00,101 --> 01:29:03,100
We have no communication.
Satellite and land lines are dead.

916
01:29:03,101 --> 01:29:06,900
You mean to tell me that I can not
pick up this telephone and call my family...

917
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,400
Mr. secretary...

918
01:29:15,401 --> 01:29:18,000
I'm here under direct
order from the presidnet.

919
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,800
You really need to see
what I have in the case.

920
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,500
You'll have to accept that there
are certain things you won't understand

921
01:29:27,501 --> 01:29:29,000
right away.

922
01:29:29,001 --> 01:29:31,700
Sector-7 is a special access division
of the goverment.

923
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,700
Convened in secret under president
Hoover 80 years ago.

924
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,600
You might remember a NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars rover...

925
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,100
We told them to report
the mission a complete failure.

926
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,500
It wasn't...
Beagle 2 transmited 13 seconds.

927
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,000
This was classified above top secret.

928
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,200
More than just a pile
of Martian rocks.

929
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,100
This is the image from Mars.

930
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:20,300
Here's the image your Spec Ops team
was able to retrieve from the base attack.

931
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:25,200
We believe they are of the
same egzoskeletal type.

932
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:28,100
And obviously not Russian
or North Korean.

933
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:31,500
Are we talking abut
an invasion?

934
01:30:31,501 --> 01:30:33,800
We intercepted a message
from your Spec Ops team.

935
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,700
These things can be hurt
by our wapons and now they know it.

936
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:42,700
That's why the virus shut us down,
so we can't coordinate against their next attack.

937
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,500
Which I would bet my ridiculous
goverment salary is coming.

938
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,900
Soon.

939
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,100
Get word to our fleet commanders
over national guard frequencies

940
01:30:54,101 --> 01:30:57,100
short wave radio channel,
it might still be working.

941
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,500
Tell them to turn their
ships arround and come home, ASAP.

942
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:04,300
And inform all commands to
prepare for imminent attack.

943
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:17,500
Captain Lennox, we need you
and your team to come with us right now!

944
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,100
She's in here.

945
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,100
What's going on?

946
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,000
You're coming with me.
You're gonna be my advisor.

947
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:33,000
Me too?

948
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:37,000
Who's this?
- He's my advisor.

949
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:40,100
He comes too.

950
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:52,900
What did they get you for?

951
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,400
I bought a car...

952
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,100
Turned out to be an
alien robot.

953
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:01,200
Who knew.

954
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,200
Please, let this work.

955
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:35,900
Fire it up Optimus.

956
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:39,700
The code...
The code on these glasses

957
01:32:39,701 --> 01:32:44,500
indicates the Allspark is
230 miles from here.

958
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:49,200
I sense Deceptions are getting
ready to mobilize.

959
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:53,700
They must know is here aswell.
- What about Bumblebee?

960
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:57,500
We can't just leave him to die.
He'll undergo some human experiments.

961
01:32:57,501 --> 01:33:01,500
He'll die in vein if we
don't acomplish our mission.

962
01:33:01,501 --> 01:33:06,100
Bumblebee is a brave soldier,
this is what he would want.

963
01:33:06,101 --> 01:33:09,500
Why are we fighting
to save the humans?

964
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:13,700
Thy are primitive,
violent race.

965
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:20,800
Were we so diferent?
They're young species.

966
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:25,500
They have much to learn.
But I've seen goodness in them.

967
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,300
Freedom is the right
of all sentient beings.

968
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:34,700
You all know there's only
one way to end this war.

969
01:33:34,701 --> 01:33:38,100
We must destroy The Cube.

970
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:43,100
If all else fails, I will
unite it with the spark in my chest.

971
01:33:43,101 --> 01:33:48,100
That's suicide, The Cube is raw
power, it could destroy you both.

972
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:52,700
A necessary sacrifice to
bring peace to this planet.

973
01:33:52,701 --> 01:33:56,400
We cannot let the humans
pay for our mistakes.

974
01:33:57,500 --> 01:34:00,000
It's been an honor
serving with you all.

975
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,400
Autobots roll out!

976
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:26,100
I got your intel, excellent work.
- Thank you sir, what about the gunships?

977
01:34:26,101 --> 01:34:29,700
Being retrofitted with Sable round now.
The heatskin will be ready for them.

978
01:34:29,701 --> 01:34:32,900
But, it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.

979
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,800
Hey kid.

980
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,500
I think we got off to a bad start.

981
01:34:39,501 --> 01:34:43,000
You want a latte, double machiato?

982
01:34:43,001 --> 01:34:46,000
Where's my car?
- Son...

983
01:34:46,001 --> 01:34:49,900
I need you to listen to me
very carefuly. People could die here.

984
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,400
We need to know everything you
know, we need to know it now.

985
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:57,700
First I'll take my car, my parents...
Maybe you should write that down.

986
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:01,300
And her jouvie record.
That's gotta be gone.

987
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,200
Like, forever.

988
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,500
Come with me, we'll
talk about your car.

989
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:09,700
Thank you.

990
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:13,200
Man's an extortionist.

991
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Allright, here's the situation.

992
01:35:16,001 --> 01:35:19,000
You've all had direct contanct
with the NBE's. - NBE's?

993
01:35:19,001 --> 01:35:22,600
Non Biological Extraterrestrial.
Try and keep up with the acronims.

994
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:26,500
What you are about to see
is totally classified.

995
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,800
Dear God, what is this?

996
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:42,400
We think, when he made his approach
over the North Pole

997
01:35:42,401 --> 01:35:45,300
our gravitational field
screwed up his telemetry.

998
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:49,300
He crashed in the ice,
probably few thousand years ago.

999
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:53,300
We shiped him here to this
facility in 1934.

1000
01:35:53,301 --> 01:35:55,700
Call him NBE-1.

1001
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:59,100
Sir I don't mean to trash on
everything you think you know but...

1002
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:01,800
That's Megatron.

1003
01:36:01,801 --> 01:36:04,000
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1004
01:36:04,001 --> 01:36:07,000
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1005
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:10,800
Your great great grandfather,
made one of the gratest discoveries

1006
01:36:10,801 --> 01:36:14,700
in the history of mankind. - Fact is
you're looking at the source of modern age.

1007
01:36:14,701 --> 01:36:20,100
Microchip, lasers, space flight,
cars, all reverse engineered

1008
01:36:20,101 --> 01:36:23,800
by studying him, NBE-1.

1009
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,500
That's what we call it.

1010
01:36:26,501 --> 01:36:29,100
And you didn't think the US military
might need to know

1011
01:36:29,101 --> 01:36:31,600
that you're keeping a hostile
alien robot frozen in the basement?

1012
01:36:31,601 --> 01:36:35,000
Until these events we had no
credible threat to national security.

1013
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:37,800
Well you got one now.

1014
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,800
So why Earth?
- It's the Allspark.

1015
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:42,500
Allspark?
What is that?

1016
01:36:42,501 --> 01:36:44,700
They came here looking
for some cube looking thing.

1017
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:48,600
And mr. NBE-1 here, aka Megatron,

1018
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,200
That's what they called him.
Who's pretty much the harbinger of death

1019
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:55,400
wants to use The Cube to transform
human technology to take over the universe.

1020
01:36:55,401 --> 01:36:58,600
That's their plane.
- Are you sure about that?

1021
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,500
You guys know where it
is don't you?

1022
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,200
Follow me.

1023
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,700
You're about to see
our crown jewel.

1024
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:25,100
Carbon dateing puts the Cube
here arround 10000 B.C.

1025
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:30,000
The First Seven didn't find it
until 1913.

1026
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:35,600
They knew it was alien becouse of the matching
hyeroglyphics on the cube aswell as NBE-1.

1027
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:38,500
President Hoover had
the dam built arround it.

1028
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:43,200
4 football fields thick concrete,
perfect way to hide its energy

1029
01:37:43,201 --> 01:37:48,500
from being detected by anyone
or any alien species on the outside.

1030
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,500
Back up, you said the dam hides
The Cube's energy...

1031
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:33,700
What kind exatcly?
- Good question.

1032
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:39,500
Please step inside,
they have to lock us in.

1033
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:51,900
Has Freddy Kruger been up here?
- No man, Freddy Kruger had 4 blades man

1034
01:38:51,901 --> 01:38:54,100
that's only 3, that's Wolverine.

1035
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:58,200
That's very funny.

1036
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:02,400
Anybody have any mechanical devices,
blackberries, cell phone?

1037
01:39:02,401 --> 01:39:04,200
I got a phone.

1038
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:10,100
Nokia's a real nasty.

1039
01:39:10,101 --> 01:39:14,500
You got to respect the Japaneese.
They know the way of the samurai.

1040
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,300
Nokia's from Finland.

1041
01:39:17,301 --> 01:39:19,500
Yes but he's, you know...

1042
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,300
We're able to take The Cube radiation...

1043
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:31,000
Bundled into that box.

1044
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:47,100
Mean little sucker.
- That thing is freaky!

1045
01:39:47,101 --> 01:39:50,200
Kinda like energizer
bunny from hell.

1046
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:34,800
Gentlemen, they know
The Cube is here.

1047
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,200
What's going on?

1048
01:40:37,201 --> 01:40:40,800
NBE-1 haler has lost power.
Backup generator, it just not gonna cut.

1049
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:42,801
Do you have an arms room?

1050
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:54,500
Get everyone to the
NBE-1 chamber now!

1051
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:59,600
They're poppin our generators.

1052
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:23,900
Cryogenic system is failing.
We're loosing NBE1.

1053
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
I want all Sable rounds
on that table.

1054
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:42,800
You got to take me to my car.

1055
01:41:42,801 --> 01:41:44,599
You have to take me to my car,
he's gonna know what to do with The Cube.

1056
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,900
Your car, it's confiscated.
- Unconiscate it.

1057
01:41:46,901 --> 01:41:48,600
We don't know what will
happen if let him near this thing.

1058
01:41:48,601 --> 01:41:51,400
Maybe you know, but I don't.
- You just want to whait here and see what happens?

1059
01:41:51,401 --> 01:41:53,700
I have people's lives at stake
here young man!

1060
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,200
Drop it.

1061
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,200
Drop your weapon soldier.

1062
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,300
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?

1063
01:42:07,301 --> 01:42:10,600
No we didn't asked to be here.
- I'm oredering you on the S-7 executive juristiction.

1064
01:42:10,601 --> 01:42:13,800
S-7 don't exist. - We don't take orders
from people who don't exist.

1065
01:42:13,801 --> 01:42:16,200
I'm gonna count to 5.
- I'm gonna count to 3.

1066
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:21,200
Simmons?
- Yes sir?

1067
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:25,100
I'd what he says, loosing
is not an option for these guys.

1068
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:31,400
Allright.

1069
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:35,600
You wanna lay the faith of the
world on the kids camaro...

1070
01:42:35,601 --> 01:42:37,100
That's cool.

1071
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,400
Stop!

1072
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:48,000
Let him go!

1073
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:51,100
You ok?

1074
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,700
They didn't hurt you, right?

1075
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:06,000
Listen to me, The Cube is
here, Decepticons are coming.

1076
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:13,600
Don't worry about them,
they're ok, they're not gonna hurt you.

1077
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:17,200
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly, he's fine.

1078
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Put the guns down,
they're not gonna hurt you.

1079
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,300
Come with me, we'll take
you to the Allspark.

1080
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:47,800
Ok, here we go.
He's doing something.

1081
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:17,100
Message from starfleet captain.
Let's get to it.

1082
01:44:17,101 --> 01:44:19,700
He's right, if we stay here we're
screwed with Megatron in other hangar.

1083
01:44:22,901 --> 01:44:24,400
and we're gonna hide it
somewhere in the city.

1084
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,900
Mission City is 22 miles away.
We're gonna sneak that cube outta here

1085
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:28,000
But we cannot make a stand
without the airforce.

1086
01:44:28,001 --> 01:44:30,400
This place must have some
kind of radio link...

1087
01:44:30,401 --> 01:44:32,500
Yes. - Short waves...
Right.

1088
01:44:32,501 --> 01:44:34,300
Sir you gotta figure out some way
to get the word out in the open.

1089
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:39,000
You need alien archives sir.
Old army radio constant.

1090
01:44:39,001 --> 01:44:41,000
Will it work?
- It's possible...

1091
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:44,900
We're set, get in the car!
Mr. secretary, get our broads in the air

1092
01:44:44,901 --> 01:44:48,100
when we get to the city
we're gonna find a radio on a F spectre, ok?

1093
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:07,500
Set up perimeter arround
the yellow sealed door!

1094
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
I am Megatron!

1095
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:04,300
I live to serve you Lord Megatron.
- Where is The Cube?

1096
01:46:04,301 --> 01:46:07,200
The humans have taken it.

1097
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:13,800
You fail me yet again
Starscream. Get them!

1098
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:18,500
Over here sir.

1099
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
We're hot, we're alive!
- Where are the mics?

1100
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:34,000
Mics? - It doens't
work without the mics.

1101
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:37,100
Let's find them.

1102
01:46:37,101 --> 01:46:40,300
Get in the chair.

1103
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,600
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the airforce?!

1104
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:49,200
Glenn, can you hotwire this
computer to transmit a tone through the radio?

1105
01:46:49,201 --> 01:46:52,500
What good is that? - Morse code,
you can use this to transmit it through that.

1106
01:46:52,501 --> 01:46:54,700
Ok I'll do it.
Turn arround.

1107
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,800
Simmons I need a screwdriver!

1108
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:11,400
There's Optimus.

1109
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,900
Allmost done.

1110
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,100
What the hell was that?

1111
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:38,900
Barricade the door.

1112
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,500
Here, put some rounds in it.

1113
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:01,500
I got it, we're transmitting!
- Send exactly what I say!

1114
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:09,500
Defence secretary Keller...

1115
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:17,800
What was that? - Authenticate
emergency action, blackbird 1195...

1116
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:22,300
Sir I have authenticated air strike
order from Sector.

1117
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,300
No, no, no!
- What?

1118
01:48:48,301 --> 01:48:50,300
Same cop.

1119
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:43,300
Cool mom!

1120
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:10,800
This is so not good.

1121
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:30,600
He's behind the pillar.

1122
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,500
Shoot that mother...

1123
01:50:38,501 --> 01:50:40,500
Maggie cover fire!

1124
01:50:43,100 --> 01:50:45,000
The air force!
They're responding!

1125
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:01,100
Yes, they're sending F22's
to the scene!

1126
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:27,300
Here, I've got short wave radios.

1127
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:31,900
What am I supposed to do with these?
- Use the, that's all we got.

1128
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:38,200
This is like dinosaur radio, man.
I'm only gonna get 20-30 miles out of this thing.

1129
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:41,200
Are there any aircraft
orbiting the city?

1130
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:43,900
F22 12 o'clock.

1131
01:51:43,901 --> 01:51:47,100
I want planes for air cover
and  get black hawks on station

1132
01:51:47,101 --> 01:51:49,000
to extract that cube, got it?

1133
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:53,900
Air force has arrived, pop smoke!

1134
01:51:53,901 --> 01:51:55,500
Raptor do you copy?

1135
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,800
We have you on visual.

1136
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:04,500
Green smoke is the mark. Provide air cover
and vector black hawks for extraction.

1137
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:11,300
It's Starscream!

1138
01:52:11,301 --> 01:52:13,300
Please tell me you copy.

1139
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:16,300
Back up!

1140
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:24,800
Back up!
- Fall back!

1141
01:52:24,801 --> 01:52:26,601
Incoming!

1142
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:53,000
Anybody hurt?!
Everyone ok?!

1143
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:04,200
Bumblebee...

1144
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:13,100
You allright?

1145
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,500
Please God...
Bumblebee get up!

1146
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,500
What the hell was that?!
What are you talking about?!

1147
01:53:22,501 --> 01:53:23,600
What do you mean what
am I talking abut?!

1148
01:53:23,601 --> 01:53:25,800
They shot at us!
- F22 pilots will never fly

1149
01:53:25,801 --> 01:53:28,500
below buildings.
That's alien, that ain't friendly.

1150
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:31,600
You gotta get up.
You're ok.

1151
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:36,600
<i>Black Hawk inbound
to your location, over.</i>

1152
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,700
A 273 10 miles.
NW 1,2 cliclks north.

1153
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,300
Move out, let's go!

1154
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:19,200
I'm not gonna leave you.

1155
01:54:57,500 --> 01:54:59,800
Come on Decepticon punk!

1156
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:21,700
Concentrate you fire!

1157
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,200
It's Megatron retreat!
Pull back!

1158
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,200
Pull back!

1159
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:04,300
We need air cover now!

1160
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:12,600
Sam help me with this.

1161
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:20,000
Come here you little creepner.

1162
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:22,800
You wanna piece of me?!
You wanna piece?!

1163
01:56:22,801 --> 01:56:26,100
No, I want 2!

1164
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:28,700
What's going on?

1165
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:32,200
Sir, that tank thing is
getting back up!

1166
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:36,000
These things just don't die.

1167
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,500
Where's The Cube?
- Right there.

1168
01:56:45,501 --> 01:56:47,900
You got to wrap it arround
the base and his neck.

1169
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:52,800
Epps get those black hawks here.
That building.

1170
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,500
I gotta go meet my guys back there,
so here take this flare.

1171
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,200
There's a tall white building
with statues on top

1172
01:57:04,201 --> 01:57:07,300
go to the roof, set the flare,
signal the chopper.

1173
01:57:07,301 --> 01:57:10,200
I can't do it!
- Listen to me, you're a soldier now!

1174
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:15,200
I need you to take this cube get
it into military hands while we hold them off.

1175
01:57:15,201 --> 01:57:17,300
Or alot of people are gonna die.

1176
01:57:17,301 --> 01:57:19,700
You got to go.
You need to go.

1177
01:57:19,701 --> 01:57:22,200
I'm not leaving until I get
Bumblebee out of here.

1178
01:57:24,500 --> 01:57:28,100
Black hawk, requesting emediate
evac, civilian boy precious cargo.

1179

headed to rooftop marked by flare.

1180
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:34,000
Sam we will protect you.
- Ok.

1181
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Sam...

1182
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:46,700
No matter what happens, I'm
really glad I got in that car with you.

1183
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:53,000
Sam get to the building!

1184
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:09,100
Watch out!

1185

Girl get that tow truck out of here!

Get outta here now!

1187
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,600
Megatron!
- Prime!

1188
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:19,500
Humans don't deserve to live.
- They deserve to choose for themselves.

1189
01:59:20,100 --> 01:59:23,000
You will die with them!

1190
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:30,600
Join them in extinction!

1191
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:51,000
Keep moving Sam.

1192
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:27,600
Sam get to the building!

1193
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:37,600

1194
02:00:50,100 --> 02:00:52,300
That jerk just demped my car.

1195
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,200
I smell you boy!

1196
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:21,800
I'll drive, you shoot!

1197
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:44,900
This isn't going well.
- Shoot!

1198
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:32,000
Nice shot.

1199
02:03:32,001 --> 02:03:35,100
Ok he's definitively dead now.
- Let's go, we've got business.

1200
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:13,900
Watch out!

1201
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:27,700
Hang on Sam!

1202
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:48,100
Is it fear or courage that
compeles you fleshling?

1203
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:08,400
Give me the Allspark and
you may live to be my pet.

1204
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:17,700
I'm never giving you this Allspark.

1205
02:05:17,701 --> 02:05:21,500
Oh so wise.

1206
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:34,100
I got you boy.

1207
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:37,500
Hold on to The Cube.

1208
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,500
Sam...

1209
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:13,500
You risked your life to
protect The Cube.

1210
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:16,400
No sacrifice...

1211
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:19,700
No victory.
- If I cannot defeat Megatron...

1212
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:22,800
You must push The Cube into my chest.

1213
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:26,800
I will sacrifice myself
to destroy it.

1214
02:06:26,801 --> 02:06:29,000
Get behind me.

1215
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:35,500
It's you and me Megatron.
- No, it's just me Prime.

1216
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:43,000
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.

1217
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:53,300
You still fight for the weak,
that is why you lose.

1218
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Fighters in 60 seconds.

1219
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:17,300
We got friendlies mixed with
bad guys, targets will be marked.

1220
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:21,000
Bring the rain.

1221
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Let's kill these things.

1222
02:07:39,700 --> 02:07:42,600
Target marked, still waiting.
- Coming on target, 20 seconds.

1223
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,500
That's 22 so stay away.

1224
02:07:57,100 --> 02:07:58,700
Move out!

1225
02:09:07,700 --> 02:09:09,600
Take them out!

1226
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:43,000
Sam put The Cube in my chest now!

1227
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:14,100
Hold up.

1228
02:10:16,500 --> 02:10:20,100
You left me no choice brother.

1229
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Sam I owe you my life.

1230
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:35,600
We are in your debt.

1231
02:10:54,100 --> 02:10:59,000
Prime, we couldn't save him.
- Oh Jazz...

1232
02:11:01,700 --> 02:11:04,500
We lost a great comrade.

1233
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:10,000
But gained new ones, thank you, all of you.

1234
02:11:10,001 --> 02:11:12,700
You honor us with your bravery.

1235
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:15,700
Permission to speak sir.

1236
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Permission granted, old friend.
- You speak now?

1237
02:11:21,200 --> 02:11:24,000
I wish to stay with the boy.

1238
02:11:24,001 --> 02:11:26,500
If that is his choice.

1239
02:11:30,700 --> 02:11:32,400
Yes.

1240
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:55,800
Gentlemen, the president has
ordered sector 7

1241
02:11:56,200 --> 02:11:59,700
be terminated, and the remains
of the dead aliens

1242
02:11:59,701 --> 02:12:01,500
disposed of.

1243
02:12:01,501 --> 02:12:06,000
Marionas Abiss, is 7 miles below
sea level, deepest place on our planet.

1244
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:10,500
Massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures

1245
02:12:10,501 --> 02:12:12,800
will crush them.

1246
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:16,900
Leaving no evidence.

1247
02:12:23,200 --> 02:12:27,400
<i>With the Allspark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.</i>

1248
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:32,400
<i>And faith has yielded it's reward.</i>

1249
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:36,900
<i>A new world to call home.</i>

1250
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:46,700
<i>We live among it's people now,
hiding in plane sight.</i>

1251
02:12:46,701 --> 02:12:49,000
<i>But watching over them in secret.</i>

1252
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:53,400
<i>Waiting...
Protecting...</i>

1253
02:12:53,401 --> 02:12:56,300
<i>I have witnessed their
capacity for courage.</i>

1254
02:12:57,200 --> 02:13:05,000
<i>And though we are worlds apart,
like us, there's more to them than meets the eye.</i>

1255
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:12,900
<i>I am Optimus Prime, and I send
this message to any surviving Autobots</i>

1256
02:13:12,901 --> 02:13:15,900
<i>taking refuge among the stars.</i>

1257
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,300
<i>We are here...</i>

1258
02:13:19,301 --> 02:13:21,601
<i>We are waiting...</i>

1259
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:34,600
<i>Subtitles by:
Sentinel</i>
