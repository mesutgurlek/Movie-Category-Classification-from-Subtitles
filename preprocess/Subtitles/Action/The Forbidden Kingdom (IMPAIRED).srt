00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:43,079
I can't understand you!

171
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:48,189
That's because
you're not listening!

172
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:51,730
[footsteps]
Behind you!

173
00:14:52,398 --> 00:14:53,499
Aah!

174
00:14:55,171 --> 00:14:55,938
Hyah!

175

[traditional Chinese

[men shouting]

177
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,336
JASON:
I don't know where I am...

178
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:29,673
or how I got here,

179
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:32,011
and who those guys were
that wanted to kill me.

180
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:33,581
But whatever you did
back there was sick.

181
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:36,153
No. Drunken fist.

182
00:15:37,624 --> 00:15:40,395
Secret kung-fu of the South.

183
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:43,034
I'm Lu Yan,
traveling scholar.

184
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:45,973
What land
do you come from, monk?

185
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:47,175
I'm not a monk.

186
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,048
I'm Jason.

187
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,852
Jason Tripitikas,
from South Boston.

188
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,760
Is this a dream?

189
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:57,564
No.

190
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,503
Where you came from
is the dream...

191
00:16:00,504 --> 00:16:03,442
through the gate
of no gate.

192
00:16:03,443 --> 00:16:06,181
Is that like a wormhole
or something?

193
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:08,252
No. It means
you are either a Zen Master...

194
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:11,625
or you carry something
very special.

195
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:13,897
This?

196
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:14,966
It was in a pawn shop,

197
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:16,134
waiting for a man
to pick it up

198
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:19,140
and return it
to its rightful owner.

199
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:21,245
What?

200
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,687
It's long been foretold

201
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:27,958
that a seeker will come

202
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,668
to return the staff and end
the reign of the Jade Warlord.

203
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:34,105
Return the staff to who?

204
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:36,810
The Monkey King.

205
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:39,615
Born of a stone

206
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:42,956
on the mountain
of fruit and flowers.

207
00:16:42,957 --> 00:16:45,027
With his weapon in hand,

208
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:47,999
his Chi became like fire,
[shouting]

209
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,638
his stick fighting
like magic.

210
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,309
He defied the order
of the land...

211
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:55,682
but the Jade Army
could not defeat him.

212
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:04,599
MONKEY KING: Ooh!

213
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,936
[soldier screaming]

214
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:06,972
Hee hee hee hee!

[soldiers shouting]

216
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:12,349
Aah!
- Aah!

217
00:17:17,394 --> 00:17:20,164
LU: The Monkey King crushed
every soldier sent to stop him.

218
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,138
With his magical staff,
he was unbeatable.

219
00:17:24,408 --> 00:17:26,144
Word of his disobedience

220
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,550
traveled deep
within the Forbidden Kingdom

221
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:33,458
to the Five Elements Mountain,
land of the immortals.

222
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:35,897
Once every 500 years,

223
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:38,670
The Jade Emperor hosts
the Peach Banquet.

224
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:41,441
It is here,
the Heavenly Ministers gather

225
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:44,113
to celebrate
their longevity

226
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:46,251
and drink
the Elixir of Immortality.

227
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:52,864
One sip of this heavenly brew
will give everlasting life,

228
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,236
free from mortal suffering
and desire.

229
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,846
[Monkey King laughing]

230
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:00,915
LU: Into the banquet,

231
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:04,088
the Monkey King crashed,
uninvited.

232
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:05,090
MONKEY KING: Whoo!

233
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:12,104
LU: The Jade Emperor was
enchanted by the Monkey King.

234
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:15,411
But the Jade Warlord
was not amused.

235
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:17,114
As Master of the Army,

236
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:21,022
The Warlord demanded
the Monkey King bow down to him.

237
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:22,125
[laughing]

238
00:18:24,998 --> 00:18:26,099
[soldiers shouting]

239
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,545
He's a bit unrefined,
that's all.

240
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:37,321
Give the naughty monkey
a title and let him go.

241
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:44,770
LU: Satisfied all was well
in heaven and earth,

242
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:46,407
The Supremely High Emperor

243
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:49,346
left to begin
his 500 years meditation,

244
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:54,056
leaving the Jade Warlord
in charge by Mandate of Heaven.

245
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:56,762
But rather than obey
the Jade Emperor's command,

246
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:59,333
the Warlord challenged
the Monkey King to a duel.

247
00:19:01,271 --> 00:19:05,078
High atop Five Elements Mountain
in the Warlord's palace,

248
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,151
[drums beating]
the battle of immortals
was fought

249
00:19:08,152 --> 00:19:11,157
To prove once and for all
whose skills were supreme.

250
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,042
[drums grow louder]

251
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:40,317
Yah!

252
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:04,867
[both giggling]

253
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,865
Hmph!

254
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:37,466

00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:55,035
Huh!

257
00:20:58,377 --> 00:20:59,912
Hwah!

258
00:21:04,956 --> 00:21:06,459
Ohh!

259
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,004
[spears clanging
against staff]

260
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:50,549
[giggling]

261
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,155
Most excellent stick fighting,
Sun Wukong.

262
00:21:54,156 --> 00:21:57,529
But without your weapon, you're
nothing but a lowly hermit!

263
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,632
Hee!

264
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:00,969
No more weapons,
no more Chi magic.

265
00:22:02,507 --> 00:22:04,677
Fist against fist.

266
00:22:06,615 --> 00:22:08,652
LU: The Monkey King
was too trusting

267
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:10,656
and believed
the Warlord's words,

268
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:12,359
laying down his magic weapon.

269
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,128
[clang]

270
00:22:14,464 --> 00:22:15,132
Hwah!

271
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:21,311
LU:
Realizing he'd been tricked,

272
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:22,981
the Monkey King
cast the staff

273
00:22:22,982 --> 00:22:24,284
out into the Middle Kingdom.

274
00:22:39,582 --> 00:22:40,183
Hmm...

275
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:45,159
martial art
is based on deception...

276
00:22:46,897 --> 00:22:48,032
my friend.

277
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,009
[drum reverberates]

278
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:55,514
LU: Being immortal,

279
00:22:55,515 --> 00:22:57,050
the Monkey King
could not be killed,

280
00:22:57,051 --> 00:22:58,787
only trapped in stone,

281
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:01,126
where he waits for the seeker
from the prophesy

282
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:04,933
to return to him his great
weapon and finally free him.

283
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:17,959
That's what I heard,
anyway.

284
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,797
[Chinese lute
playing in background]

285
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,667
Long time ago.

286
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:23,871
How long
has he been imprisoned?

287
00:23:23,872 --> 00:23:27,412
Five hundred years,
give or take a few decades.

288
00:23:27,413 --> 00:23:29,984
They say
when the Monkey King is free,

289
00:23:29,985 --> 00:23:31,320
the Jade Emperor will return.

290
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:35,261
How do I get home?

291
00:23:35,262 --> 00:23:39,536
You must return the staff
to Five Elements Mountain.

292
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:41,140
You must
free the Monkey King.

293
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:42,744
I can't
free the Monkey King.

294
00:23:42,745 --> 00:23:43,979
I gotta get home.

295
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,485
Innkeeper! More wine.

296
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:47,820
Jeez, don't you think
you've had one too many?

297
00:23:49,658 --> 00:23:51,895
Wine is my inspiration.

298
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:54,300
In some parts,
I am known as the poet.

What do we do now?

305
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,369
How good is your kung-fu?

306
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,240
Ah!

307
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:31,844
He who speaks does not know.

308
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,048
He who knows
does not speak.

309
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:35,150
Surely, you are masterful.

310
00:24:41,831 --> 00:24:42,799
Where did you get
that weapon?

311
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,369
It's a fake.

312
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,342
You can find
anything these days
on the Silk Road.

313

Out of way, old fool.

Huh?

315
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,354
Hand it over.

01:00:54,305 --> 01:00:56,208
They call the left field fence
the Green Monster.

677
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,148
It's true.

678
01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:03,892
It does kind of look like
a dragon, though, doesn't it?

679
01:01:09,136 --> 01:01:12,609
Have you family back
in this land you come from?

680
01:01:14,948 --> 01:01:16,150
My mother.

681
01:01:17,086 --> 01:01:18,154
Father?

682
01:01:20,326 --> 01:01:20,893
Never knew him.

683
01:01:23,332 --> 01:01:24,935
Do you ever long for him?

684
01:01:27,207 --> 01:01:28,609
Wonder who he was?

685
01:01:32,618 --> 01:01:34,922
Maybe the only thing
I've ever been good at...

686
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:38,195
pretending that I don't.

687
01:01:41,637 --> 01:01:43,038
She is sorry.

688
01:01:48,117 --> 01:01:49,753
NI CHANG: How romantic.

689
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:55,598
NI CHANG: Men will tell you
what you want to hear, Sparrow.

690
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,206
But in the end, they will
leave you with nothing.

691
01:02:03,315 --> 01:02:05,552
You survived
the River of Sand.

692
01:02:05,553 --> 01:02:06,988
Impressive.

693
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,825
And you, boy...

694
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:10,496
so far from home.

695
01:02:10,497 --> 01:02:14,170
I can ensure
your safe return.

696
01:02:14,171 --> 01:02:16,174
Just bring
the weapon forward.

697
01:02:16,175 --> 01:02:17,009
I don't think so.

698
01:02:18,513 --> 01:02:19,447
Why do you
want the staff?

699
01:02:21,185 --> 01:02:23,489
When I deliver
the lost weapon,

700
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:27,397
the Jade Warlord shall grant me
the Elixir of Immortality.

701
01:02:29,971 --> 01:02:32,809
An orphan girl,
a lost traveler,

702
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:36,082
an old drunk,
and a monk who has failed

703
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:38,052
at the same task
for half his life.

704

[scoffs]

705
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:44,933
Misfits following a misfit

LU: Hyah!

720
01:05:07,161 --> 01:05:09,899
Lu! You okay?

721
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,901
Just thirsty.

722
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:16,714
Lu!

723
01:05:24,464 --> 01:05:26,200
[grunting]

724
01:05:34,317 --> 01:05:36,154
It's okay.
He's immortal, right?

725
01:05:36,155 --> 01:05:37,357
I mean, he is, right?

726
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:39,628
Wine.
He needs his wine!

727
01:05:39,629 --> 01:05:40,663
There is nothing we can do.

728
01:05:40,664 --> 01:05:41,866
What are you saying?

729
01:05:41,867 --> 01:05:42,700
We have to do something!

730
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:44,204
[goats bleating]

[monks shouting]

732

ABBOT: I'm afraid the wound
is too deep.

733
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,948
He will not survive it.

734
01:06:23,586 --> 01:06:24,521
JASON: He needs wine.

735
01:06:25,892 --> 01:06:28,362
He's one of
the eight immortals.

736
01:06:28,363 --> 01:06:29,497
Wine is his Elixir.
Please.

737
01:06:32,304 --> 01:06:34,007
ABBOT:
We will send a walking monk.

738
01:06:35,444 --> 01:06:37,013
LU: Don't you have
a running monk?

739
01:06:59,628 --> 01:07:00,662
When I was your age...

740
01:07:01,866 --> 01:07:04,169
I was a scholar-warrior
in training.

741
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:08,345
My arrow was good.
So, too, my kung-fu.

742
01:07:09,681 --> 01:07:14,825
So I was chosen to take
the civil examinations.

743
01:07:16,295 --> 01:07:18,265
To pass would place me...

744
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:23,242
in the very short line
of scholar immortals.

745
01:07:27,018 --> 01:07:27,752
I failed.

746
01:07:30,424 --> 01:07:31,225
You're not an immortal?

747
01:07:34,366 --> 01:07:37,905
If one
does not attach himself

748
01:07:37,906 --> 01:07:39,809
to people and desires...

749
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:44,653
never shall
his heart be broken.

750
01:07:47,092 --> 01:07:47,993
But then...

751
01:07:50,065 --> 01:07:51,500
does he ever truly live?

752
01:07:55,476 --> 01:07:56,644
I would rather die
a mortal...

753
01:07:59,451 --> 01:08:00,620
who has cared
about someone...

754
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:05,429
than a man free

755
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:06,498
from his own death.

756
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:10,473
I don't want to lose you.

757
01:08:13,748 --> 01:08:15,383
Forget about me.

758
01:08:18,924 --> 01:08:22,164
ABBOT: There is only one
Elixir of Immortality.

759
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:25,370
It is
the Emperor's mix of Jade,

760
01:08:25,371 --> 01:08:28,577
Cinnabar,
and Salts of Mercury.

761
01:08:28,578 --> 01:08:32,184
It is forever stored in
the realm of the Jade Palace...

762
01:08:33,555 --> 01:08:38,064
high in the Jade firmament,
rarely touched by mortals.

763
01:08:38,065 --> 01:08:41,738
To reach it, one
must take the north road

764
01:08:41,739 --> 01:08:42,740
and cross the border

765
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:44,042
of heaven and earth...

766
01:08:45,112 --> 01:08:47,817
only to face
the Jade Army.

767
01:08:50,123 --> 01:08:51,124
I'm sorry.

768
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,997
There is no other way.

769
01:08:55,066 --> 01:08:56,702
Yes, there is.

770
01:08:58,306 --> 01:09:01,379
In two nights,
there should be no moon.

771
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:04,284
We can take the south side
of the fourth peak

772
01:09:04,285 --> 01:09:05,420
under cover of darkness.

773
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:08,326
We have to go now.
No!

774
01:09:09,496 --> 01:09:10,497
But he's going to die!

775
01:09:12,335 --> 01:09:13,871
We go now, we all die.

776
01:09:18,682 --> 01:09:21,553
There is more at stake,
an entire kingdom.

777
01:09:25,897 --> 01:09:27,398
Your passage home.

778
01:09:30,072 --> 01:09:34,180
We will advance in two nights,
when the moon has ceased.

779
01:09:34,181 --> 01:09:35,549
So be it!

780
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:46,939
[thunder rumbling
in the distance]

781
01:10:23,115 --> 01:10:23,715
When she met you...

782
01:10:24,785 --> 01:10:27,824
long ago in a tea house...

783
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:31,097
you were a lost boy
and frightened.

784
01:10:35,006 --> 01:10:36,675
Not the kind
she would stand and fight with.

785
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:34,820
You've made
a most excellent judgment.

786
01:12:52,824 --> 01:12:54,827
The seeker from the prophecy.

787
01:12:56,365 --> 01:12:58,602
Not quite what I expected.

788
01:12:58,603 --> 01:13:02,176
JASON: A man is dying
back on Song Mountain.

789
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:03,746
I need the Elixir.

790
01:13:05,283 --> 01:13:07,955
And why should
I give it to you?

791
01:13:07,956 --> 01:13:10,460
Because I brought you
the staff.

792
01:13:10,461 --> 01:13:12,063
The life of your friend

793
01:13:12,064 --> 01:13:13,833
for the power
to rule a kingdom?

794
01:13:15,004 --> 01:13:16,739
A most reasonable offer.

795
01:13:17,843 --> 01:13:20,881
This man, a good friend?

796
01:13:22,185 --> 01:13:23,988
And a good teacher.

797
01:13:23,989 --> 01:13:27,060
The man who honors
his teacher honors himself.

798
01:13:28,531 --> 01:13:32,105
However, there is
a bit of a problem

799
01:13:32,106 --> 01:13:34,075
with your request.

800
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,879
You see...

801
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,320
I've promised the Elixir
to someone else.

802
01:13:39,321 --> 01:13:41,291
But she didn't
bring you the staff.

803
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:42,860
I did.

804
01:13:42,861 --> 01:13:44,730
The boy has a point.

805
01:13:48,372 --> 01:13:51,144
My liege,
you made a promise.

806
01:13:51,145 --> 01:13:55,953
There is but one way
to resolve such matters.

807
01:13:55,954 --> 01:13:58,592
A martial challenge...
to the death.

808
01:14:01,433 --> 01:14:02,567
With pleasure.

809

The Elixir of Immortality.

I find that quite amusing.

Did you really think,
even for a minute,

826
01:17:20,211 --> 01:17:21,746
you stood a chance?

827
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:27,024
I didn't think so.

I am sorry.

Traveler...

904
01:30:32,125 --> 01:30:34,196
you have come far,
through the gate of no gate

905

until their paths
go separate ways.

I'll never forget you.

I guess that's what being
immortal truly means.

How's he doin'?

946
01:35:12,216 --> 01:35:14,019
It missed his heart.
He'll live.

947
01:35:16,124 --> 01:35:18,429
Of course I'll live.

948
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:19,932
I'm immortal.

949

Did you return the staff
to rightful owner?

950

I did.

Is he gonna be all right?

955
01:36:15,323 --> 01:36:15,890
Looks like it.

956
01:36:16,993 --> 01:36:18,529

And so the legend is told

963
01:36:49,266 --> 01:36:52,138
that the Monkey King
began his journey west

964
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:54,142
in search of truth,

965
01:36:54,143 --> 01:36:56,915
while the traveler
returned to his world

966
01:36:56,916 --> 01:37:02,027
to walk the path of the warrior
and find his own truth.

967
01:37:02,028 --> 01:37:03,296
As one tale ends...

968
01:37:04,633 --> 01:37:06,007
So another
begins.
