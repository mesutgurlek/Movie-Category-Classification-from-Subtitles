1
00:00:56,506 --> 00:01:00,135
You don't like flying, do you?

2
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:02,609
What gives you that idea?

3
00:01:04,714 --> 00:01:05,646
You want to know the secret...

4
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:09,377
to surviving air travel?

5
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:10,577
After you get
where you're going,

6
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:12,211
take off your shoes and socks.

7
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,085
Then walk around,

8
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,852
making fists
with your toes.

9
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,859
Fists with your toes?

10
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:21,863
It sounds crazy,

11
00:01:21,964 --> 00:01:24,899
but I've been doing it
for nine years.

12
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,936
Better than a shower
and a cup of coffee.

13
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:30,563
Okay.

14
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:42,212
It's okay.
I'm a cop.

15
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:45,444
Trust me.

16
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:48,591
I've been doing this
for 11 years.

17
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,159
<i>On behalf of</i>
<i>the captain and crew,</i>

18
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,127
<i>we'd like to welcome you</i>
<i>to Los Ángeles.</i>

19
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,130
<i>Have a very Merry Christmas.</i>

20
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,915
<i>Flight 227 to Tucson</i>
<i>now boarding at gate 14.</i>

21
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,088
Ah.

22
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,600
How do you do?

23
00:02:43,546 --> 00:02:44,945
Ladies and gentlemen.

24
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:46,947
Ladies and gentlemen!

25
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:50,951
I want to congratulate
each and every one of you...

26
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:53,954
for making this
one of the greatest years...

27
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:56,957
in the history
of the Nakatomi Corporation.

28
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:01,394
On behalf of
the chief executive officer,

29
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:04,398
Mr. Ozu,
and the board of directors,

30
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,900
we wish you
a Merry Christmas...

31
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,062
and a Happy New Year!

32
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:10,571
Merry Christmas!

33
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:12,402
Happy New Year!

34
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:13,907
Hey, Holly,

35
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,409
what about
dinner tonight, huh?

36
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:18,412
Harry, it's Christmas Eve.

37
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:21,415
Families, stockings...

38
00:03:23,352 --> 00:03:24,910
chestnuts...

39
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:26,420
Rudolph and Frosty.

40
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:29,423
Any of these things
ring a bell?

41
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:31,425
Actually, I was
thinking more...

42
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:34,428
of mulled wine,
a nice aged brie,

43
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,430
and a roaring fireplace.

44
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:38,432
You know what I'm saying?

45
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:42,436
Ginny, it's 5:40.

46
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:45,439
Go join the party.
Have some champagne.

47
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,442
You're making me feel
like Ebenezer Scrooge.

48
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:51,445
Can the baby
handle a little sip?

49
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,947
That baby's ready
to tend bar.

50
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,075
Last chance.

51
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:57,277
Bye.

52
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,951
McClane residence.
Lucy McClane speaking.

53
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:08,553
Hello, Lucy McClane.

54
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:10,564
This is
your mother speaking.

55
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,065
Mommy!

56
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,068
When are you
coming home?

57
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,070
Pretty soon.
Pretty soon.

58
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,573
You'll be in bed
when I get there, though.

59
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:21,575
Let me talk to Paulina.

60
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:24,077
And no snooping
around the house,

61
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,613
looking for presents.

62
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:28,081
Is Daddy coming home
with you?

63
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,253
Well, we'll see what...

64
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,755
Santa and Mommy
can do, okay?

65
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,757
Put Paulina on.
Bye, honey.

66
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,451
Paulina!

67
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,558
<i>Hola,</i> Mrs. Holly.

68
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:48,432
Um, did Mr. McClane call?

69
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,439
No, Mrs. Holly.
No <i>teléfono.</i>

70
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,941
Well, he probably just
didn't have time...

71
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,442
before his flight.

72
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,275
Um, make up
the spare bedroom...

73
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,780
just in case.

74
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,442
<i>Si,</i> Mrs. Holly.
I do that already.

75
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,385
What would I do
without you, Paulina?

76
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:26,907
Oh!

77
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:32,208
California.

78
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:46,427
Hey, I'm John McClane.

79
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,087
Argyle.

80
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:49,994
I'm your limo driver.

81
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:54,360
Nice bear.

82
00:05:58,541 --> 00:06:00,441
Okay... Argyle.

83
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:03,011
What do we do now?

84
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,875
You tell me.

85
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:07,916
It's my first time
driving a limo.

86
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:11,009
This is my first time
riding in one.

87
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:14,054
Relax. We got everything
in this mug, man.

88
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:17,387
Look at this...
CD, CB, TV,

89
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:20,053
telephone, full bar, VHS.

90
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:23,895
If your friend's
hot to trot,

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,400
I know a few
mama bears.

92
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:28,402
Or is he married?

93
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:29,903
He's married.

94
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:31,405
Okay.

95
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:33,407
Oh, sorry about that.

96
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,409
It's the girl's day off.

97
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,912
I didn't know
you were gonna sit up front.

98
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:41,916
So, uh, your lady
live out here?

99
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:43,918
About the past
six months.

100
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,921
Meaning you still
live in New York?

101
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:49,617
You always ask
this many questions, Argyle?

102
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:51,352
Sorry, man.
I used to drive a cab.

103
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,223
People would expect
a little chitchat.

104
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,660
So you divorced?

105
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:56,664
Just drive the car, man.

106
00:06:56,766 --> 00:06:59,166
Come on.
You divorced?

107
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:01,600
You separated?
She beat you up?

108
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:05,772
She had a good job.

109
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,775
It turned into
a great career.

110
00:07:07,877 --> 00:07:10,778
<i>That meant</i>
<i>she had to move here.</i>

111
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,280
You're very fast, Argyle.

112
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:16,317
<i>So why didn't you come?</i>

113
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:19,547
<i>Well?</i>

114
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:21,179
What's up?

115
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,622
Because I'm
a New York cop.

116
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:27,127
I got a six-month backlog
of New York scumbags.

117
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:30,357
I can't just pick up
and go that easy.

118
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:33,458
You thought
she wouldn't make it out here,

119
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:35,969
so why bother
to pack, right?

120
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:38,973
Like I said,
you're very fast, Argyle.

121
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:42,101
You mind if we
hear some tunes?

122
00:07:45,347 --> 00:07:48,714
Hey, that will work.

123
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:52,083
Don't you got
any Christmas music?

124
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:54,315
This <i>is</i> Christmas music.

125
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:58,322
<i>#It was December 24th</i>
<i>on Hollis Ave. After dark #</i>

126
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:00,918
<i># When I seen a man chillin'</i>
<i>with his dog in the park #</i>

127
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,861
<i>#I approached them</i>
<i>very slowly #</i>

128
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:04,728
<i># With my heart full of fear</i>
<i>looked at his dog #</i>

129
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,495
<i># Oh, my God,</i>
<i>a ill reindeer #</i>

130
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:08,593
<i>#But then I was illin'</i>
<i>'cause the man had a beard #</i>

131
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:11,172
<i>#And a bag full of goodies</i>
<i>12:00 hit, man #</i>

132
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:12,570
<i>#So I turned my head a second #</i>

133
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:14,074
<i>#And the man was gone #</i>

134
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:15,234
<i>#But he must have</i>
<i>dropped his wallet #</i>

135
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:16,902
<i>#Smack dead on the lawn #</i>

136
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:18,912
<i>#I picked the wallet up,</i>
<i>and then I took a pause #</i>

137
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:21,278
<i># Took out the</i>
<i>license and it cold said "Santa Claus"#</i>

138
00:08:21,383 --> 00:08:23,943
<i>#A million dollars in it</i>
<i>cold hundreds of G's ##</i>

139
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:27,454
So your lady sees you,
the music comes up,

140
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:30,457
and you live happily
ever after, right?

141
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:32,459
I can live with that.

142
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:36,964
If it doesn't work out,
you got a place to stay?

143
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:38,966
I'll find a place.

144
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:40,399
Tell you what.

145
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:42,801
I'll wait
in the parking garage.

146
00:08:42,905 --> 00:08:45,396
You score, you call
on the car phone.

147
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:48,636
You strike out,
I'll get you a hotel.

148
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:50,769
You're all right, Argyle.

149
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,941
Just remember that
when you sign for the tip.

150
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:19,101
Hi.

151
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:20,607
Good evening.

152
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:23,109
I'm here to see
Holly McClane.

153
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:25,112
Just type it in there.

154
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:32,414
Cute toy.

155
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:35,820
If you have to
take a leak,

156
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:37,790
it finds
your zipper.

157
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:53,301
Christ.

158
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:00,314
30th floor.

159
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,781
The party.

160
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:04,648
They're the only ones
left in the building.

161
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:06,152
Take the express elevator...

162
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:08,155
until you hear the noise.

163
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:09,656
Thanks.

164
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,814
Champagne, sir?

165
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,316
Yeah, thanks.

166
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,482
Oh, I'm sorry.

167
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:49,318
Hey, Merry Christmas!

168
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:54,494
Jesus.

169
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:56,996
Fuckin' California.

170
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:59,846
Why don't
I talk to him right now?

171
00:11:59,881 --> 00:12:01,426
Why don't
I talk to him right now?

172
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:02,595
Hi.

173
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:03,933
I'm looking for...

174
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,267
Holly Gennero.

175
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:06,466
Yeah.

176
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:08,440
You must be
John McClane.

177
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:09,943
Joe Takagi.

178
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:11,945
How was your ride in?

179
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:13,947
I have you to thank?

180
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:16,449
Seemed the least
we could do.

181
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:18,952
Quite a place
you have here.

182
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:20,453
It will be.

183
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:21,955
Several floors are
under construction.

184
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:24,457
Holly went to fax
some documents.

185
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,959
In the meanwhile,

186
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:27,961
her office is
right back here.

187
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:32,196
Ellis.

188
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:36,067
I was just making a call.

189
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:39,834
I want you to meet
John McClane,

190
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:41,307
Holly's husband...

191
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,638
Holly's policeman.

192
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:45,475
Ellis is in charge of
international development.

193
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:48,482
Heard a heck of a lot
about you.

194
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:50,518
Missed some.

195
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,820
Can I get you anything?

196
00:12:53,922 --> 00:12:55,321
Food? Cake?

197
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:57,324
Some watered-down
champagne?

198
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:59,485
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

199
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:01,927
You throw quite a party.

200
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,430
I didn't realize...

201
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,762
they celebrated
Christmas in Japan.

202
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,768
Pearl Harbor
didn't work out,

203
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,931
so we got you
with tape decks.

204
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,272
Actually, it's sort of
a double celebration.

205
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:19,074
Holly helped us close
a big deal today.

206
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:22,446
<i>I'll be out in</i>
<i>a couple of minutes.</i>

207
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:27,956
John.

208
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,450
Have you met everyone?

209
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,962
We've been
sticking him with spears.

210
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,965
Of course, he has.

211
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,467
She was made
for the business.

212
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,968
Tough as nails.

213
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,470
I was hoping...

214
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,971
you made that flight.

215
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,974
Show him the watch.

216
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,134
Later.

217
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:49,642
Go on.
Show him.

218
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,110
What, are you
embarrassed?

219
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:54,273
<i>A token of appreciation</i>
<i>for her hard work.</i>

220
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:55,975
It's a Rolex.

221
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,485
I'm sure
I'll see it later.

222
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,715
Is there a place
where I could wash up?

223
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:04,258
Sure.

224
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,973
Ellis gets very depressed...

225
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,634
this time of year.

226
00:14:22,744 --> 00:14:25,611
He thought he was
God's greatest gift.

227
00:14:25,714 --> 00:14:27,614
Yeah.
I know the type.

228
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:31,117
Think he's got
his eye on you.

229
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,619
That's okay...

230
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:34,120
I have my eye...

231
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:35,622
on his private bathroom.

232
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:37,123
Where you staying?

233
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:39,126
Things happened so fast,

234
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:42,129
I didn't get
a chance to ask you.

235
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:44,961
Cappy Roberts
retired out here.

236
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,797
He told me
I could bunk with him.

237
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:50,633
Cappy retired, huh?
Where's he live?

238
00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:51,899
Ramona.

239
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:54,100
Pomona.

240
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:55,301
Huh?

241
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,468
<i>Pomona.</i>

242
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:57,772
Pomona.

243
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,814
Yeah.

244
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:02,748
You'll be in the car
half the time.

245
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:04,250
Why don't we make it easy?

246
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:06,913
I have a spare bedroom.

247
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:09,718
It's not huge
or anything, but...

248
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,226
the kids would love
to have you at the house.

249
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:15,421
They would, huh?

250
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:20,263
I would, too.

251
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:24,096
Ooh!

252
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:26,140
Sorry.

253
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,448
I missed you.

254
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,254
I guess you didn't
miss my name, though, huh?

255
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:48,295
Except maybe when
you're signing checks?

256
00:15:48,397 --> 00:15:50,422
Since when are you
"Ms. Gennero"?

257
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:54,968
This is
a Japanese company.

258
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,166
- They figure
a married woman's got...
- You are a married woman.

259
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:02,107
- You're married to me.
- Are we going to have
this conversation again?

260
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,406
- We never finished
this conversation in July.
<i>- I had an opportunity...</i>

261
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:06,811
- I had to take it.
- Right, no matter
what the consequences.

262
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:09,713
- No matter what it did
to our marriage.
- It didn't do anything...

263
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:11,979
except change your idea
of what our marriage should be.

264
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:15,079
- You don't have a clue what my
idea of our marriage should be.
- I know exactly...

265
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,556
what your idea
of our marriage should be.

266
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:19,422
Ms. Gennero, I...

267
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:22,857
Excuse me.

268
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:24,728
Hi.

269
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:28,166
Um, Mr. Takagi
is looking for you.

270
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,603
<i>He wants you</i>
<i>to say something to the troops.</i>

271
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:37,136
Speech time.

272
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,646
Be back in
a few minutes.

273
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,460
That was great, John.

274
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:54,961
Good job.

275
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:56,621
Very mature.

276
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:48,281
So Kareem rebounds, right?

277
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:50,283
Feeds Worthy on the break,

278
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:52,717
over to A.C., to Magic,
then back to Worthy, right?

279
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,282
Boom!

280
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,550
Two points!

281
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:01,359

Yeah, Argyle?

All right.
Where are you?

What's the word with
you and your lady?

311

Mr. Takagi,

356
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:42,002
I could talk about industrialization
and men's fashions all day,

357

but I'm afraid
work must intrude,

00:28:44,238 --> 00:28:46,763
and my associate here
has some questions for you.

359
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:51,368
Sort of fill-in-the-blanks
questions, actually.

360
00:29:00,888 --> 00:29:02,549
I don't have that code!

361
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,387
You broke in here
to access our computer?

362
00:29:07,095 --> 00:29:10,587
Any information you could get,
when they wake up in Tokio,

Sit... down!

365
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:28,278
Mr. Takagi,
I'm really not interested...

366
00:29:28,383 --> 00:29:29,907
in your computer.

367
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,422
But I need the code key...

368
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:40,426
because I <i>am</i> interested
in the $640 million...

369
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,428
in negotiable bearer bonds...

370
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,431
that you have
locked in your vault.

371
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:49,697
And the computer
controls the vault.

372
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:51,931
You want money?

373
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,703
What kind
of terrorists are you?

374
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:01,447
Who said
we were terrorists?

375
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:24,904
<i>The bonds represent</i>

377
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:38,311
The code, please.

378
00:30:38,953 --> 00:30:40,181
It's useless to you.

379
00:30:40,288 --> 00:30:44,247
There are seven vault safeguards,
and the code key's only one of them.

380
00:30:44,358 --> 00:30:46,189
You'll never get it open.

381
00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:49,195
Then there's no reason
not to tell us.

382
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:50,491
I told you.

383
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,691
It's not over yet.

384
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:59,205
It's a very nice suit...

385
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:01,298
Mr. Takagi.

386
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:04,139
It would be a shame
to ruin it.

387
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:09,876

the code.

391
00:31:17,758 --> 00:31:19,157

392
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:23,196
<i>Two...</i>

393
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:27,291
- Three.
- I don't know it. I'm telling you!

394
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:28,993
Get on the jet to Tokio
and ask the chairman.

395
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:31,936
I'm telling you.
You're just gonna have to kill me.

396
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,233
Okay.

397
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,776
We'll do it
the hard way.

398
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,871
Tony, see if you
can dispose of that.

399
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,247
Karl, better check
on Heinrich's work.

400
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,600
Nothing.

401
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:12,576
See to Heinrich.

402
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,581
Now...

403
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,584
you can
break the code?

404
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,586
You didn't
bring me along...

405
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,588
for my charming
personality.

406
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,098
Argyle, tell me
you heard the shots.

407
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,929
You're callin'
the police right now.

408
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,094
Of course
I'm coming by later.

409
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,605
Have I ever lied to you?

410
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:43,040
My boss?
Thinks I'm on my way to Vegas.

411
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:46,602
Uli, get up on the pipes.

412
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,615
Marco, you go
through here.

413
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,618
I'll throw you the cord.

414
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,919
Hans, we're on the roof.

415
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:13,565
Here.

416
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,085
Thirty minutes
to break the code,

417
00:33:28,189 --> 00:33:31,090
Two hours, two and a half hours
for the five mechanicals...

418
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:32,591
at the minimum.

419
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:36,094
The seventh lock,
however, is out of my hands.

420
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:00,120
I'm sorry...

421
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:02,553
The seventh lock...
the electromagnetic seal.

422
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:04,022
You do understand...

423
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,956
the circuits cannot
be cut locally.

424
00:34:07,662 --> 00:34:09,755
Trust me.

425
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:13,127
Why the fuck
didn't you stop him, John?

426
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:17,636
'Cause then
you'd be dead, too, asshole!

427
00:34:17,738 --> 00:34:19,638
Think, goddamn it!
Think!

428
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:34,050
We've got a fire alarm.

429
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,645
Call 911.

430
00:34:35,756 --> 00:34:39,658
Give them the guard's name
and the building code number,

431
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,819
and cancel the alarm.

432
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,658
Then disable the system.

433
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:48,064
On what floor
did the alarm go off?

434
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:52,170
Now, shall we go?

435
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:53,672
<i>Nein.</i>

436
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:07,119
Oh, baby, come to Papa.

437
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:08,620
Come on.

438
00:35:14,428 --> 00:35:17,022
Come on, baby.

No!

441
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:27,505
Turn the fuckin' truck around!

442
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:04,108
The fire has been
called off, my friend.

443
00:36:07,214 --> 00:36:10,615
No one is coming to help you.

444
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:17,850
You might as well
come out and join the others.

445
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:22,627
I promise
I won't hurt you.

446
00:36:51,892 --> 00:36:54,156
Drop it, dickhead.
It's the police.

447
00:36:54,261 --> 00:36:56,161
You won't hurt me.

448
00:36:56,263 --> 00:36:57,662
Yeah? Why not?

449
00:36:57,765 --> 00:37:00,165
Because
you're a policeman.

450
00:37:00,267 --> 00:37:02,599
There are rules
for policemen.

451
00:37:02,703 --> 00:37:07,072
Yeah. That's what
my captain keeps telling me.

452
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:34,633
Aah!

453
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,900
You bet your ass
I wish to proceed.

454
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,078
Nine million terrorists
in the worid,

455
00:38:58,185 --> 00:39:01,416
and I got to kill one
with feet smaller than my sister.

456
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,970
I wanted this
to be professional,

457
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:55,541
efficient, and cooperative.

458
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,770
Not a lot to ask.

459
00:39:57,878 --> 00:40:00,779
Alas, Mr. Takagi
did not see it that way,

460
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:05,784
so he won't be joining us
for the rest of his life.

461
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:08,787
<i>We can go</i>
<i>any way you want it.</i>

462
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:11,653
<i>You can walk out</i>
<i>or be carried out,</i>

463
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:15,923
but have no illusions...
we are in charge.

464
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:21,434
<i>So... decide now, each of you,</i>

465
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:23,196
<i>And please remember...</i>

466
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:26,931
<i>we have left nothing</i>
<i>to chance.</i>

467
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:36,607
Get them back!

468
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:48,756
"Now I have

469
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:53,692
<i>Ho-ho-ho. "</i>

470
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:58,470
A security guard
we missed?

471
00:40:58,572 --> 00:41:01,405
They're usually
just growing fat on a pension.

472
00:41:01,508 --> 00:41:03,908
This is
something else.

473
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,411
We have to do
something, Hans.

474
00:41:15,522 --> 00:41:17,046
Yes, we do.

475
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:19,682
Tell Karl his brother is dead.

476
00:41:19,793 --> 00:41:21,658
Tell him
to come down.

477
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:24,253
<i>Karl...</i>
<i>komm sofort.</i>

478
00:41:24,364 --> 00:41:29,927
<i>Franco, you and Fritz take</i>

479

480
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:36,402
Aah!

481
00:42:36,503 --> 00:42:38,232
I want blood!

482
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:40,932
But let Heinrich
plant the detonators.

483
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:43,942
The police will waste hours
trying to negotiate.

484
00:42:44,044 --> 00:42:46,945
Then you can
tear the building apart.

485
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:50,278
But until then,
do not alter the plan.

486
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:52,909
And if he alters it?

487
00:42:57,057 --> 00:42:59,150
What do you think?

488
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,395
Something's wrong.

489
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:04,896
Cops?

490
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,899
John.

491
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:11,266
<i>John... Aw, Christ!</i>
<i>He can fuck this whole thing up!</i>

492
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:13,362
<i>What does</i>
<i>he think he's doing?</i>

493
00:43:13,473 --> 00:43:14,770
His job.

494
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,275
Bullshit. His job's
3,000 miles away.

495
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:21,780
Without him, we might
be able to get out of here.

496
00:43:21,882 --> 00:43:25,283
Tell that to Takagi.

497
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:51,138
Mayday. Mayday,
Anyone copying channel nine.

498
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:53,645
Terrorists have seized
the Nakatomi Building...

499
00:43:53,747 --> 00:43:55,237
<i>and are holding</i>
<i>30 hostages.</i>

500
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:57,442
<i>Unknown number</i>
<i>of terrorists...</i>

501
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,850
Six or more armed
with automatic weapons.

502
00:44:00,954 --> 00:44:04,151
Where's the best place
to transmit?

503
00:44:04,258 --> 00:44:05,589
<i>- Somebody answer me, goddamn it!</i>
- The roof!

504
00:44:05,692 --> 00:44:07,159
<i>Go! Go!</i>

505
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,164
<i> It's the same</i>
<i>address as that fire signal.</i>

506
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:13,665
I'll handle it.

507
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:17,669
Attention,
whoever you are,

508
00:44:17,771 --> 00:44:20,171
this channel
is reserved for emergencies.

509
00:44:20,274 --> 00:44:21,741
No shit, lady!

510
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:23,742
I'm not ordering
a pizza!

511
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:38,186
No one kills him
but me.

512
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,194
They have
killed one hostage.

513
00:44:42,296 --> 00:44:44,025
They are fortifying
their positions...

514
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:45,598
while you're jerking
me off on the radio!

515
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:47,690
Sir, I've
already told you.

516
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:49,701
This is
a reserved channel.

517
00:44:49,803 --> 00:44:53,204
If this is
an emergency call, dial 911.

518
00:44:53,307 --> 00:44:57,266
Otherwise, I'll report
this as an FCC violation.

519
00:44:57,377 --> 00:45:01,370
Fine! Come and arrest me,
just send the police now!

520
00:45:02,983 --> 00:45:04,348
Ow!

521
00:45:14,861 --> 00:45:19,594
See if there's
a black-and-white
to do a drive-by.

522
00:45:29,776 --> 00:45:32,108
Thought you guys
just ate doughnuts.

523
00:45:32,212 --> 00:45:34,737
They're for my wife.

524
00:45:34,848 --> 00:45:36,782
Yeah.

525
00:45:36,883 --> 00:45:38,714
She's pregnant.

526
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,343
Yeah.

527
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:43,218
Bag it.

528
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,223
Big time.

529
00:45:47,894 --> 00:45:49,293
Thanks.

530
00:45:52,399 --> 00:45:54,799
Dispatch
to 8-Lincoln-30. Over.

531
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:57,301
This is 8-Lincoln-30.
Come on in. Over.

532
00:45:57,404 --> 00:45:58,803
Investigate a Code 2...

533
00:45:58,905 --> 00:46:00,805
at Nakatomi Plaza,
Century City.

534
00:46:00,907 --> 00:46:02,573
8- Lincoln-30 to dispatch.
I'm on my way.

535
00:46:02,608 --> 00:46:04,239
8- Lincoln-30 to dispatch.
I'm on my way.

536
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:04,228
Giris.

537
00:48:19,846 --> 00:48:23,646
Shit! Where the fuck?

538
00:48:44,371 --> 00:48:45,770
Oh, my God.

539
00:49:01,821 --> 00:49:03,721
He's in the elevator shaft.

540
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:07,723
Perfect.
The elevators are locked off.

541
00:49:07,827 --> 00:49:10,591
Just shut him in
and come back down.

542
00:49:14,334 --> 00:49:15,733
Oh, fuck.

543
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,006
Karl, the police
are probably...

544
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:25,975
on their way already.

545
00:49:46,866 --> 00:49:48,265
Christ.

546
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,838
I can stall them but not
if they hear gunshots.

547
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:58,410
If you lock him in,
he'll be neutralized...

548
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,971
Come out to the coast!

549
00:51:05,078 --> 00:51:07,205
We'll get together,
have a few laughs.

550
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:17,917
Now I know
what a TV dinner feels like.

551
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,200
<i>Such!</i>

552
00:52:24,858 --> 00:52:27,019
<i>Karl, komm!</i>
<i>Die polizei!</i>

553
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:28,754
<i>Die polizei!</i>

554
00:53:12,572 --> 00:53:14,972
Well, it's about time.

555
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,980
No signs
of disturbance, dispatch.

556
00:53:23,082 --> 00:53:24,879
Possible crank call.

557
00:53:24,984 --> 00:53:26,975
<i>Check the area</i>
<i>and confirm.</i>

558
00:53:32,926 --> 00:53:35,724
Who's driving this car?
Stevie Wonder?

559
00:53:37,497 --> 00:53:39,590
I see a guard inside.

560
00:53:39,699 --> 00:53:42,497
<i>I'm going in</i>
<i>for a closer look.</i>

561
00:53:42,602 --> 00:53:44,001
<i>Use caution.</i>

562
00:53:47,106 --> 00:53:48,403
Eddie?

563
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:50,999
I had a feelin'
you'd be callin'.

564
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:17,093
Evenin', Officer.
What can I do for you?

565
00:54:25,578 --> 00:54:28,513
Heh heh heh!

566
00:54:28,615 --> 00:54:31,482
We had
that false alarm, you know.

567
00:54:31,584 --> 00:54:33,484
That computer
sent you out...

568
00:54:33,586 --> 00:54:35,486
on another
wild-goose chase.

569
00:54:35,588 --> 00:54:36,987
They been chasing bugs...

570
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:38,990
since they installed
this system.

571
00:54:39,092 --> 00:54:40,992
<i>Notre Dame</i>
<i>on top of USC...</i>

572
00:54:41,094 --> 00:54:42,561
Ah, shit!

573
00:54:42,662 --> 00:54:45,222
I got 50 bucks bet
on them assholes.

574
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,961
<i>Come on, come on.</i>
<i>Where's the fucking cavalry?</i>

575
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:58,236
Ah!

576
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,151
Bah!

577
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,285
<i>... was good for 52 yards.</i>

578
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,296
Mind if I look around?

579
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,298
Help yourself.

580
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,800
<i>Seven seconds left</i>
<i>in this period.</i>

581

<i>Seven to nothing,</i>

582
00:55:29,943 --> 00:55:31,808
Freeze, Motherfucker!

583
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,242
Don't shoot!

584
00:55:33,346 --> 00:55:34,677
Drop it!

585
00:55:34,781 --> 00:55:36,180
Okay! Don't shoot!

586
00:55:36,282 --> 00:55:37,306
Drop it!

587
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,941
Ah!

588
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,834
Ah, the hell with this!

589
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,129
Ah!

590
00:56:03,643 --> 00:56:05,611
Ah!

591
00:56:05,712 --> 00:56:08,272
You are dog now!

592
00:56:08,381 --> 00:56:11,407
No more table!
Where are you going, pal?

593
00:56:11,517 --> 00:56:14,111
Next time
you have a chance...

594
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:15,744
to kill someone,

595
00:56:15,855 --> 00:56:18,016
don't hesitate.

596
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:25,161
Thanks for the advice.

597
00:56:25,264 --> 00:56:27,164
Sorry to waste your time.

598
00:56:27,266 --> 00:56:28,665
No problem.

599
00:56:28,768 --> 00:56:30,201
Merry Christmas.

600
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:31,600
Merry Christmas.

# Dum de dum delightful #

603
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,915
For the love...

604
00:56:50,556 --> 00:56:52,421
8- Lincoln-30
to dispatch.

605
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:53,924
Go ahead.

606
00:56:54,027 --> 00:56:55,927
That's a wild-goose chase...

607
00:56:56,029 --> 00:56:57,428
here at Nakatomi Plaza.

608
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:59,430
Everything here's okay.
Over.

609
00:56:59,532 --> 00:57:03,024
# But nobody has no place to go #

# Let it snow, let it snow ##

611
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:10,335
Goddamn it!
Jesus H. Christ!

612
00:57:18,117 --> 00:57:20,210
Welcome
to the party, pal!

613
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,014

614

00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:33,257
Police under automatic
rifle fire at Nakatomi!

617
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,357
I need back-up assistance now!

618
00:57:35,468 --> 00:57:37,959
Now, Goddamn it! Now!

619
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,252
Monica,
I can get us a table.

620
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:02,191
Wolfgang and I
are very close friends.

621
00:58:02,295 --> 00:58:04,695
I interviewed him,
for God's sake.

622
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:06,196
<i>... Nakatomi.</i>

623

<i>Repeat.</i>
<i>Officer needs assistance at...</i>

624
00:58:08,301 --> 00:58:12,704
<i>I'm at Nakatomi Plaza.</i>
<i>They're turning my car</i>
<i>into Swiss cheese!</i>

625
00:58:12,805 --> 00:58:14,705
<i>I need</i>
<i>back-up assistance now!</i>

626
00:58:14,807 --> 00:58:16,866
<i>Now, Goddamn it! Now!</i>

627
00:58:36,829 --> 00:58:39,889
Never thought I'd love
to hear that sound.

628
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,967
All of you relax.

629
00:58:42,068 --> 00:58:44,969
This is a matter
of inconvenient timing.

630
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:46,971
Police action was inevitable...

631
00:58:47,073 --> 00:58:49,473
and, as it happens,
necessary.

632
00:58:49,575 --> 00:58:52,476
Let them fumble about outside,
and stay calm.

633
00:58:52,578 --> 00:58:54,239
This is simply the beginning.

634
00:58:55,548 --> 00:58:59,814
I thought I told all of you
I want radio silence.

635
00:58:59,919 --> 00:59:02,513
I didn't get
that message, Hans.

636
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,989
You should have put it
on the bulletin board.

637
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:09,391
Since I waxed Tony and Marco
and his friend,

638
00:59:09,495 --> 00:59:13,625
I figured you and Karl
and Franco might be lonely.

639
00:59:13,733 --> 00:59:16,395
How does he know
so much...

640
00:59:16,502 --> 00:59:19,869
That's very kind of you.

641
00:59:19,972 --> 00:59:22,873
I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.

642
00:59:22,975 --> 00:59:27,173
You are most troublesome
for a security guard.

643
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,078
Eeeh! Sorry, Hans.
Wrong guess.

644
00:59:30,183 --> 00:59:32,845
Want to go
for DoubleJeopardy,

645
00:59:32,952 --> 00:59:35,420
where the scores
can really change?

646
00:59:37,523 --> 00:59:40,356
Mm, these are
very bad for you.

647
00:59:40,459 --> 00:59:42,825
Who are you, then?

648
00:59:42,929 --> 00:59:45,420
The fly in
the ointment, Hans.

649
00:59:45,531 --> 00:59:47,431
The monkey
in the wrench,

650
00:59:47,533 --> 00:59:49,433
the pain in the ass.

651
00:59:50,903 --> 00:59:52,427
Whoa!

652
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,274
Don't use the radio.

653
00:59:56,375 --> 01:00:00,436
See if he's lying about Marco.
Find out who's missing.

654
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,208
Mr. Mystery Guest,

655
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,719
are you still there?

656
01:00:08,821 --> 01:00:10,721
Yeah, I'm still here,

657
01:00:10,823 --> 01:00:14,725
unless you want to open
the front door for me.

658
01:00:14,827 --> 01:00:16,294
I'm afraid not,

659
01:00:16,395 --> 01:00:18,295
but you have me
at a loss.

660
01:00:18,397 --> 01:00:20,991
You know my name,
but who are you?

661
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,931
Just another American...

662
01:00:23,035 --> 01:00:25,731
who saw too many movies
as a child?

663
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:28,272
Another orphan
of a bankrupt culture...

664
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:31,673
who thinks he's
John Wayne, Rambo,

665
01:00:31,777 --> 01:00:33,244
Marshal Dillon?

666
01:00:33,346 --> 01:00:36,247
I was always partial
to Roy Rogers, actually.

667
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:38,340
I liked those
sequined shirts.

668
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:41,511
Do you think you have
a chance, Mr. Cowboy?

669
01:00:44,056 --> 01:00:47,048
Yippee-kai-yay,
motherfucker.

670
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,096
I can get the jump
on everybody...

671
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:54,860
with a remote.

672
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:56,958
Harvey,
keep your pants on.

673
01:00:57,069 --> 01:00:58,969
Sam, I'm begging you.

674
01:00:59,071 --> 01:01:01,403
Simon's already out
with the remote.

675
01:01:01,507 --> 01:01:05,409
I'm not sitting on this!
I am going out there!

676
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:07,911
You don't give me a truck,

677
01:01:08,014 --> 01:01:09,914
I'll steal a truck.

678
01:01:10,016 --> 01:01:12,382
Give us a break,
Thornburg.

679
01:01:12,485 --> 01:01:13,645
Eat it, Harvey!

680
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,085
Four, three, two...

681
01:01:16,188 --> 01:01:17,712
one.

682
01:01:17,823 --> 01:01:19,723
<i>Harvey, we're</i>
<i>on the air.</i>

683
01:01:22,695 --> 01:01:25,858
Good evening.
This is Harvey Johnson.

684
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,827
And I'm Gail Wallens,

685
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,461
and this is
<i>Nightline News</i> at 10:00.

686
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:35,472
<i>Our top stories</i>
<i>on this Christmas eve...</i>

687
01:01:35,574 --> 01:01:38,475
Take truck number five.
Get out of here.

688
01:01:44,817 --> 01:01:46,910
He wasn't lying
about Marco.

689
01:01:47,019 --> 01:01:49,078
He's down
on the street.

690
01:01:49,188 --> 01:01:51,349
<i>The other man</i>
<i>was Heinrich,</i>

691
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,948
and his bag
is missing.

692
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,858
He had the detonator.

693
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:02,733
Theo.

694
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:03,859
Theo.

695
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,198
Yo!

696
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,204
We may have
some problems.

697
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,206
How's your schedule?

698
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:11,208
Three down.
Four to go.

699
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:14,211
Then don't waste time
talking to me.

700
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:17,214
This is sergeant Al Powell
of the L.A.P.D.

701
01:02:17,316 --> 01:02:20,479
If the person
who radioed can hear me,

702
01:02:20,586 --> 01:02:22,952
acknowledge
this transmission.

703
01:02:23,055 --> 01:02:24,886
I say again...

704
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:28,222
If the person who radioed
can hear me,

705
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,727
acknowledge
this transmission!

706
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,791
I read you.
You the guy in the car?

707
01:02:37,903 --> 01:02:39,803
What's left of him.

708
01:02:39,905 --> 01:02:41,839
Can you identify
yourself?

709
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:43,841
Not now.
Maybe later.

710
01:02:43,943 --> 01:02:45,843
This is a party line.

711
01:02:45,945 --> 01:02:48,345
The neighbor's got
itchy trigger fingers.

712
01:02:48,447 --> 01:02:51,075
You got 30 hostages
on the 30th floor.

713
01:02:51,183 --> 01:02:54,675
<i>- The leader's name is Hans.</i>
- We have to find him
and shut him up.

714
01:02:54,787 --> 01:02:56,687
- He's telling them everything!
- Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.

715
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:59,019
Until then, he can waste
as much time as he likes,

716
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:03,186
but we must find
the bag, Fritz.

717
01:03:03,295 --> 01:03:05,593
We must have
the detonators.

718
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:07,689
<i> They got</i>
<i>missiles, automatic weapons,</i>

719
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,291
<i>and enough explosives</i>
<i>to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

720
01:03:10,403 --> 01:03:12,701
They're down to nine now.

721
01:03:12,805 --> 01:03:15,205
These guys
are mostly European,

722
01:03:15,307 --> 01:03:17,707
judging by
their clothing labels and...

723
01:03:25,151 --> 01:03:26,550
cigarettes.

724
01:03:26,652 --> 01:03:29,212
They're well-financed
and very slick.

725
01:03:29,321 --> 01:03:31,221
How do you
know that?

726
01:03:31,323 --> 01:03:32,813
I've seen
enough phony I.D. S...

727
01:03:32,925 --> 01:03:37,885
to recognize that the ones
they got must have cost a fortune.

728
01:03:37,997 --> 01:03:39,396
Add all that up,

729
01:03:39,498 --> 01:03:41,329
I don't know
what the fuck it means,

730
01:03:41,434 --> 01:03:45,029
but you got some bad-ass
perpetrators here to stay.

731
01:03:45,137 --> 01:03:47,332
I hear you, partner.

732
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,670
L.A.'s finest are on it.

733
01:03:49,775 --> 01:03:52,266
Light 'em
if you got 'em.

734
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:54,676
Way ahead of you, partner.

735
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:58,181
So, what do I call you?

736
01:03:58,284 --> 01:04:00,184
Call me...

737
01:04:01,454 --> 01:04:02,546
Roy.

738
01:04:02,655 --> 01:04:05,180
If you think of
anything else,

739
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:07,191
don't you be shy, okay?

740
01:04:07,293 --> 01:04:10,694
In the meantime,
let us do our job.

741
01:04:10,796 --> 01:04:12,696
<i>They're all yours, Al.</i>

742
01:04:30,316 --> 01:04:32,784
All right,
who's talking to him?

743
01:04:32,885 --> 01:04:36,218
I am, sir. Sergeant Powell.
Al Powell.

744
01:04:36,322 --> 01:04:39,223
Dwayne Robinson, Powell.
What's the deal here?

745
01:04:39,325 --> 01:04:41,156
What do
these pricks want?

746
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:43,160
Well, we don't exactly know.

747
01:04:43,262 --> 01:04:45,162
We haven't heard from them.

748
01:04:45,264 --> 01:04:47,698
Who have you been talking to?

749
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,327
We don't know.
He won't give us his name.

750
01:04:51,437 --> 01:04:54,338
He appears to be
the one who phoned.

751
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,169
He's killed
one terrorist,

752
01:04:56,275 --> 01:04:57,833
and he claims two others.

753
01:04:57,943 --> 01:05:00,844
Claims? Powell,
has it occurred to you...

754
01:05:00,946 --> 01:05:03,744
he could be one
of the terrorists...

755
01:05:03,849 --> 01:05:05,840
<i>or some nutcase in there?</i>

756
01:05:05,951 --> 01:05:08,749
No. In fact,
I think he's a cop...

757
01:05:08,854 --> 01:05:11,687
Maybe not L.A.P.D.,
but he's a badge.

758
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:12,722
Why?

759
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:15,191
A hunch,
things he said,

760
01:05:15,294 --> 01:05:18,422
like being able
to spot a phony I.D.

761
01:05:18,531 --> 01:05:22,592
Jesus Christ, Powell.
He could be a fucking
bartender for all we know!

762
01:05:22,701 --> 01:05:24,692
TV's here.

763
01:05:24,803 --> 01:05:26,771
Oh, shit.

764
01:05:43,422 --> 01:05:45,219
I have a request.

765
01:05:45,324 --> 01:05:48,157
What idiot
put you in charge?

766
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:49,727
You did...

767
01:05:49,828 --> 01:05:51,819
when you murdered
my boss.

768
01:05:51,931 --> 01:05:54,126
Now everybody's
looking to me.

769
01:05:54,233 --> 01:05:56,667
Personally,
I'd pass on the job.

770
01:05:56,769 --> 01:06:00,068
I don't enjoy being
this close to you.

771
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:09,509
Go on.

772
01:06:09,615 --> 01:06:11,583
We have
a pregnant woman.

773
01:06:11,684 --> 01:06:14,551
Relax. She's not due
for a couple weeks,

774
01:06:14,653 --> 01:06:16,951
but sitting on that rock isn't
doing her back any good.

775
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:21,220
So, I would like permission
to move her to one of the
offices where there's a sofa.

776
01:06:21,327 --> 01:06:25,263
I'll have a sofa
brought out. Good enough?

777
01:06:25,364 --> 01:06:27,025
Good enough.

778
01:06:27,132 --> 01:06:29,066
Unless you
like it messy,

779
01:06:29,168 --> 01:06:31,466
start bringing us
in groups to the bathroom.

780
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:34,596
Yes. You're right.

781
01:06:34,707 --> 01:06:37,335
<i>It will be done.</i>

782
01:06:37,443 --> 01:06:39,001
<i>Was there</i>
<i>something else?</i>

783
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,374
No, thank you.

784
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:52,315
Mr. Takagi chose
his people well, Mrs...

785
01:06:52,424 --> 01:06:54,153
Gennero.

786
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:59,064
<i>Miss</i> Gennero.

787
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,867
<i>We interrupt this program</i>

788
01:07:03,969 --> 01:07:07,166
This is Richard Thornburg
live from Century City.

789
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,673
Tonight, Los Ángeles
has joined...

790
01:07:09,775 --> 01:07:12,676
the sad and woridwide
fraternity of cities...

791
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:14,678
whose only
membership requirement...

792
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:18,181
<i>is to suffer the anguish</i>
<i>of international terrorism.</i>

793
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,184
<i>Approximately</i>
<i>two hours ago,</i>

794
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,186
<i>an unidentified</i>
<i>group of men...</i>

795
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,688
<i>seized control</i>
<i>of the Nakatomi Building,</i>

796
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,190
<i>sealing off</i>
<i>all entrances and exits.</i>

797
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:30,057
<i>All telephone lines</i>
<i>have been cut,</i>

798
01:07:30,162 --> 01:07:32,357
and the only communication
now possible...

799
01:07:32,464 --> 01:07:35,524
<i>has been through the use</i>
<i>of CB communicators,</i>

800
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:37,864
<i>the group apparently</i>
<i>brought with them.</i>

<i>by the parking structure.</i>

806
01:07:49,481 --> 01:07:51,312
Let me ask you something.

807
01:07:51,417 --> 01:07:54,318
Does this stairway
go up to the escalator?

808
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:55,648
Yeah.

809
01:07:55,754 --> 01:07:57,654
Tell them to go ahead.

810
01:07:57,756 --> 01:07:59,155
What's going on?

811
01:07:59,258 --> 01:08:02,159
What's it look like?
We're going in.

812
01:08:02,261 --> 01:08:04,320
Going in?
Man, that's crazy!

813
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:07,160
There could be
over 30 hostages!

814
01:08:07,266 --> 01:08:09,166
We don't know shit,
Powell.

815
01:08:09,268 --> 01:08:12,169
How come there were
no ransom demands?

816
01:08:12,271 --> 01:08:14,501
Where's their list
of demands?

817
01:08:14,606 --> 01:08:17,507
All we know is
somebody shot your car.

818
01:08:17,609 --> 01:08:20,407
It's probably the same
son of a bitch...

819
01:08:20,512 --> 01:08:22,343
<i>you've been</i>
<i>talking to on that radio.</i>

820
01:08:22,448 --> 01:08:24,177
Excuse me, sir.

821
01:08:24,283 --> 01:08:27,616
What about the body
that fell out the window?

822
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,188
Probably some stockbroker...
Got depressed.

823
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:31,688
Let's go.

824
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:33,189
Hit your lights.

825
01:08:33,292 --> 01:08:34,691
<i>Let's go.</i>

826
01:08:34,793 --> 01:08:36,055
<i>Lights on!</i>

827
01:08:48,073 --> 01:08:49,973
Powell?

828
01:08:50,075 --> 01:08:53,101
You still with me, babe?
What's going on?

829
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,180
Yo, Al.

830
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:59,011
I'm kind of busy.
I'll talk to you later.

831
01:08:59,118 --> 01:09:00,642
Al, what's wrong?

832
01:09:00,753 --> 01:09:01,845
We'll talk later.

833
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:04,923
If you are what
I think you are,

834
01:09:05,023 --> 01:09:07,821
you'll know when
to listen, shut up,

835
01:09:07,926 --> 01:09:10,019
and when to pray.

836
01:09:10,129 --> 01:09:12,359
Jesus Christ!
You're coming in.

837
01:09:12,464 --> 01:09:15,900
<i>I told you what kind</i>
<i>of people they are.</i>

838
01:09:16,001 --> 01:09:18,162
<i>Let's load them up.</i>
<i>Blue go.</i>

839
01:09:20,773 --> 01:09:24,106
They'll be coming.
Everyone get ready.

840
01:09:24,209 --> 01:09:27,178
Theo, you are
the eyes now.

841
01:09:40,192 --> 01:09:43,286
Rivers, begin
your reconnoiter.

842
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,633
Shit!

843
01:10:10,155 --> 01:10:13,147
Hey, come on, man.
Let's go.

844
01:10:22,267 --> 01:10:23,962
Ow! Jesus!

845
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,138
All right, spread out.

846
01:11:26,498 --> 01:11:28,159
Shut up.

847
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:31,134
Let's go.

848
01:11:35,645 --> 01:11:38,170
You macho assholes.
No! No!

849
01:11:41,251 --> 01:11:44,015
Ahem... all right.
Listen up, guys.

850
01:11:44,121 --> 01:11:47,579
'Twas the night
before Christmas,

851
01:11:47,691 --> 01:11:50,057
and all through the house,

852
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:52,185
not a creature
was stirring, except...

853
01:11:52,295 --> 01:11:55,230
the four assholes
coming in the rear...

854
01:11:55,332 --> 01:11:57,027
in standard
cover formation.

855
01:11:59,202 --> 01:12:00,794
We're all set.

856
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:02,769
We're ready.

857
01:12:04,207 --> 01:12:05,765
Kick ass.

858
01:12:05,876 --> 01:12:06,808
Go.

859
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:08,810
Right.
Let's do it.

860
01:12:25,996 --> 01:12:27,896
They're shooting
at them.

861
01:12:27,998 --> 01:12:29,989
It's panic fire.
They can't see.

862
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,863
They're shooting
at the lights.

863
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:37,873
They're going
after the lights.

864
01:12:37,974 --> 01:12:39,771
<i>Pull them back.</i>

865
01:12:39,876 --> 01:12:41,776
It's not happening.

866
01:12:41,878 --> 01:12:43,345
Mike, burn it.

867
01:12:45,749 --> 01:12:47,376
Don't be impatient.

868
01:12:47,484 --> 01:12:50,214
Just wound them.

869
01:12:51,988 --> 01:12:53,956
They're sitting ducks
without lights.

870
01:12:54,057 --> 01:12:55,388
They're almost in.

871
01:12:55,492 --> 01:12:57,722
<i>Send in the car.</i>

872
01:12:57,828 --> 01:12:58,594
Send in the car.

873
01:12:58,629 --> 01:12:59,361
Send in the car.

874
01:13:12,742 --> 01:13:14,039
Jesus Christ!

875
01:13:17,314 --> 01:13:20,044
Rivers, Rodriguez,
report.

876
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:22,948
Whoa! Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

877
01:13:27,123 --> 01:13:29,648
The police
have themselves an RV.

878
01:13:35,098 --> 01:13:36,258
Southeast corner.

879
01:13:48,278 --> 01:13:51,304
Oh, Jesus Christ.

880
01:14:01,858 --> 01:14:05,885
Get back!
Get the fuck back!

881
01:14:07,898 --> 01:14:08,887
Get over there!

882
01:14:08,999 --> 01:14:11,126
<i>Schnell! Schnell!</i>

883
01:14:11,234 --> 01:14:14,328
<i>Mach schnell!</i>

884
01:14:14,437 --> 01:14:16,803
<i>Weiter! Weiter!</i>
<i>Weiter!</i>

885
01:14:16,907 --> 01:14:18,966
<i>Mach schnell!</i>
<i>Mach schnell!</i>

886
01:14:19,075 --> 01:14:20,940
<i>Weiter!</i>

887
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,844
<i>Mach los! Mach los!</i>

888
01:14:44,568 --> 01:14:46,001
I see him!

889
01:15:05,488 --> 01:15:08,389
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast!

890
01:15:08,491 --> 01:15:11,483
Hang on, Rivers.
That's an order.

891
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:13,790
Hit it again.

892
01:15:13,897 --> 01:15:17,128
Hans, you motherfucker!
You made your point!
Let them pull back!

893
01:15:17,233 --> 01:15:19,597
Thank you, Mr. Cowboy.
I'll take it under advisement.
Hit it again!

894
01:15:19,632 --> 01:15:21,961
Thank you, Mr. Cowboy.
I'll take it under advisement.
Hit it again!

895
01:15:34,718 --> 01:15:36,743
Fire.

896
01:15:51,468 --> 01:15:53,368
Fuck me.

897
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:55,938
Get them out of the car.

898
01:15:57,374 --> 01:15:59,433
- Aah!
- Aah!

899
01:16:05,515 --> 01:16:06,812
Fuck it.

900
01:16:09,786 --> 01:16:11,515
<i>Mach schnell!</i>
<i>Mach los!</i>

901
01:16:18,395 --> 01:16:21,796
Let's see you take this
under advisement, jerkweed.

902
01:16:25,869 --> 01:16:28,497
Geronimo,
motherfucker.

903
01:16:47,357 --> 01:16:48,255
Shit!

904
01:16:53,263 --> 01:16:55,197
They're using
artillery on us!

905
01:16:55,298 --> 01:16:57,766
You idiot,
it's not the police.

906
01:16:57,867 --> 01:16:59,596
It's him.

907
01:17:06,876 --> 01:17:08,366
Holy shit.

908
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:15,442
My God.

909
01:17:16,886 --> 01:17:18,786
Tell me you got that.

910
01:17:18,888 --> 01:17:21,288
I got it.
I got it.

911
01:17:21,391 --> 01:17:24,258
Eat your heart out,
Channel Five.

912
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:28,194
We've had
an update on the takeover
of the Nakatomi Building...

913
01:17:28,298 --> 01:17:30,289
Sources say
the terrorist leader, "Hans,"

914
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,800
may be this man...
Hans Gruber,

915
01:17:32,902 --> 01:17:35,803
a member of the radical
West German <i>Volksfrei</i> movement.

916
01:17:35,905 --> 01:17:37,805
Strangely,
the <i>Volksfrei</i> leadership...

917
01:17:37,907 --> 01:17:40,239
issued a communique
an hour ago...

918
01:17:40,343 --> 01:17:42,436
stating Gruber had been expelled
from that organization...

919
01:17:42,545 --> 01:17:44,342
Al? Al? Do you copy?

920
01:17:44,447 --> 01:17:46,415
Are you all right?

921
01:17:46,516 --> 01:17:48,006
Yeah, I'm fine.

922
01:17:49,886 --> 01:17:51,353
What was that?

923
01:17:51,454 --> 01:17:54,252
Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?

924
01:17:54,357 --> 01:17:57,258
There you go.
Is the building on fire?

925
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,193
No, but it's going to
need a paint job.

926
01:18:00,296 --> 01:18:03,197
Our spotter said
you got two that time.

927
01:18:03,299 --> 01:18:05,028
Is that him?

928
01:18:05,135 --> 01:18:06,534
Yes, sir.

929
01:18:06,636 --> 01:18:09,537
I don't know
who you think you are,

930
01:18:09,639 --> 01:18:13,131
but you just destroyed
a building.

931
01:18:13,243 --> 01:18:16,371
We do not want your help.
Is that clear?

932
01:18:16,479 --> 01:18:18,879
I've got 100 people
down here,

933
01:18:18,982 --> 01:18:20,882
and they're covered
with glass.

934
01:18:20,984 --> 01:18:23,214
Who gives a shit
about glass?

935
01:18:23,319 --> 01:18:25,310
Who the fuck is this?

936
01:18:25,421 --> 01:18:28,390
This is deputy chief of police,
Dwayne T. Robinson,

937
01:18:28,491 --> 01:18:31,790
and I am in charge
of this situation.

938
01:18:31,895 --> 01:18:33,385
Oh, you're in charge?

939
01:18:33,496 --> 01:18:35,726
I got bad news
for you, Dwayne.

940
01:18:35,832 --> 01:18:39,063
It doesn't look like you're
in charge of jack shit.

941
01:18:39,169 --> 01:18:42,138
- Listen to me, you little asshole...
- Asshole?

942
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:46,868
I'm not the one who just got
buttfucked on national TV, Dwayne!

943
01:18:46,976 --> 01:18:49,137
<i>Listen to me, jerkoff,</i>

944
01:18:49,245 --> 01:18:52,214
quit being part
of the fucking problem...

945
01:18:52,315 --> 01:18:55,216
and put the other guy
back on!

946
01:18:57,821 --> 01:19:00,016
Hey, Roy, how are
you feeling?

947
01:19:00,123 --> 01:19:01,886
Pretty fucking
unappreciated, Al.

948
01:19:01,991 --> 01:19:03,720
Hey, look.
I love you.

949
01:19:03,827 --> 01:19:06,762
So do a lot
of the other guys.

950
01:19:06,863 --> 01:19:09,229
You hang in there.
You hear me?

951
01:19:09,332 --> 01:19:11,391
You hang in there.

952
01:19:12,836 --> 01:19:15,862
Yeah, thanks, partner.

953
01:19:20,343 --> 01:19:22,243
What are you doing?

954
01:19:22,345 --> 01:19:24,745
I'm tired
of waiting to see...

955
01:19:24,848 --> 01:19:28,079
who gets us killed first...
them or your husband.

956
01:19:28,184 --> 01:19:29,879
What are you
going to do?

957
01:19:29,986 --> 01:19:33,251
Hey, babe, I negotiate
million-dollar deals for breakfast.

958
01:19:33,356 --> 01:19:35,847
I think I can
handle this "Euro-trash."

959
01:19:35,959 --> 01:19:38,427
Hey,
<i>sprechen sie,</i> talk?

960
01:19:38,528 --> 01:19:41,258
If you'd listened to me,
he'd be neutralized.

961
01:19:41,364 --> 01:19:44,265
I don't want neutral. I want dead.

962
01:19:44,367 --> 01:19:46,528
Hope I'm not
interrupting.

963
01:19:46,636 --> 01:19:47,660
What does he want?

964
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:49,431
It's not
what I want.

965
01:19:49,539 --> 01:19:51,939
It's what
I can give you.

966
01:19:58,882 --> 01:20:01,180
<i>Oy, let's be</i>
<i>straight, okay?</i>

967
01:20:01,284 --> 01:20:03,275
It's obvious you're not
some dumb schmuck up here...

968
01:20:03,386 --> 01:20:05,946
to snatch a few purses,
am I right?

969
01:20:06,055 --> 01:20:07,613
Very perceptive.

970
01:20:07,724 --> 01:20:09,282
I watch
<i>60 Minutes.</i>

971
01:20:09,392 --> 01:20:12,122
I say to myself,
"these guys are professional,

972
01:20:12,228 --> 01:20:14,128
"they're motivated,
they're happening,

973
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:16,323
i.e., they want
something," huh?

974
01:20:16,432 --> 01:20:19,230
<i>I couldn't care less</i>
<i>about your politics.</i>

975
01:20:19,335 --> 01:20:21,462
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys,

976
01:20:21,571 --> 01:20:23,129
maybe it's the Hebes,
Northern Ireland...

977
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:24,297
It's none
of my business.

978
01:20:24,407 --> 01:20:27,001
I figure you're here to negotiate.
Am I right?

979
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:28,509
You're amazing.

980
01:20:28,611 --> 01:20:30,602
You figured this
all out already?

981
01:20:30,713 --> 01:20:32,476
Hey, business
is business.

982
01:20:32,582 --> 01:20:35,483
You use a gun.
I use a fountain pen.
What's the difference?

983
01:20:35,585 --> 01:20:37,815
Let's put it
in my terms.

984
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:40,048
You're here on a hostile takeover.
You grab us for some greenmail,

985
01:20:40,156 --> 01:20:43,455
<i>but you didn't expect</i>
<i>some poison pill running around.</i>

986
01:20:43,559 --> 01:20:46,255
Am I right?

987
01:20:46,362 --> 01:20:49,923
Hans, bubby, I'm
your white knight.

988
01:20:50,033 --> 01:20:52,593
I must have missed
<i>60 Minutes.</i>

989
01:20:52,702 --> 01:20:54,795
What are you saying?

990
01:20:56,873 --> 01:20:59,933
The guy upstairs is
fucking things up, huh?

991
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:06,780
I can give him to you.

992
01:21:09,519 --> 01:21:11,578
<i>Oh, God...</i>

993
01:21:11,688 --> 01:21:12,780
Uhh...

994
01:21:12,889 --> 01:21:13,787
Roy?

995
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:16,051
Roy,
you all right?

996
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:19,788
Just trying to fire down
a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.

997
01:21:19,896 --> 01:21:22,865
What do they put
in these things anyway?

998
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:25,526
Sugar, enriched flour,

999
01:21:25,635 --> 01:21:27,535
partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil,

1000
01:21:27,637 --> 01:21:29,798
polysorbate 60...

1001
01:21:29,906 --> 01:21:32,033
and yellow dye
number five...

1002
01:21:32,141 --> 01:21:34,541
Just everything
a growing boy needs.

1003
01:21:34,644 --> 01:21:37,044
How many kids
you got, Al?

1004
01:21:37,146 --> 01:21:41,207
My wife is working
on our first.

1005
01:21:41,317 --> 01:21:43,376
How about you,
cowboy?

1006
01:21:43,486 --> 01:21:45,351
You got any kids?

1007
01:21:46,656 --> 01:21:49,921
Yeah... two.

1008
01:21:50,026 --> 01:21:54,122
Hope I can see 'em
swingin' on a jungle gym
with AIJr. Someday.

1009
01:21:56,165 --> 01:21:58,065
Well, now,
that's a date,

1010
01:21:58,167 --> 01:22:01,068
but you bring
the ice cream.

1011
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:03,070
<i>Touching, cowboy. Touching.</i>

1012
01:22:03,172 --> 01:22:05,504
<i>Or should I call you...</i>

1013
01:22:05,608 --> 01:22:08,406
Mr. McClane.?

1014
01:22:08,511 --> 01:22:11,742
Mr. Officer John McClane...

1015
01:22:11,848 --> 01:22:15,443
<i>of the New York</i>
<i>Police Department?</i>

1016
01:22:15,551 --> 01:22:18,384
- Get on the phone to Harry
in New York. Come on, baby. Move.!
- Got it.

1017
01:22:18,488 --> 01:22:20,718
Better get a hold
of somebody at dispatch.

1018
01:22:20,823 --> 01:22:24,589
Sister Theresa called me
Mr. McClane in the third grade,

1019
01:22:24,694 --> 01:22:26,594
my friends call me John,

1020
01:22:26,696 --> 01:22:29,722
and you're neither,
shithead.

1021
01:22:29,832 --> 01:22:33,598
I have someone
who wants to talk to you...

1022
01:22:33,703 --> 01:22:36,331
A very special friend...

1023
01:22:36,439 --> 01:22:38,930
<i>who was with you</i>
<i>at the party tonight.</i>

1024
01:22:44,647 --> 01:22:47,047
Hey, John boy.

1025
01:22:48,317 --> 01:22:49,375
Ellis?

1026
01:22:49,485 --> 01:22:51,385
Yeah.
Now, listen, John.

1027
01:22:51,487 --> 01:22:53,455
They're giving me
a few minutes...

1028
01:22:53,556 --> 01:22:55,490
to try to talk
some sense into you.

1029
01:22:55,591 --> 01:22:58,583
I know you think
you're doin' your job,

1030
01:22:58,694 --> 01:23:01,458
but you're just
draggin' this thing out.

1031
01:23:01,564 --> 01:23:04,965
<i>No one gets out of here</i>
<i>until these guys can talk...</i>

1032
01:23:05,068 --> 01:23:06,467
to the L.A. Police, and that
just ain't gonna happen...

1033
01:23:06,569 --> 01:23:08,730
till you stop messing up
the works, <i>capisci?</i>

1034
01:23:13,576 --> 01:23:16,067
Ellis, what have
you told them?

1035
01:23:16,179 --> 01:23:20,172
I told them
we were old friends,

1036
01:23:20,283 --> 01:23:22,478
and you were
my guest.

1037
01:23:22,585 --> 01:23:24,780
You shouldn't
be doing this.

1038
01:23:24,887 --> 01:23:26,548
Tell me about it.

1039
01:23:32,495 --> 01:23:34,463
All right, John,
listen.

1040
01:23:34,564 --> 01:23:37,556
They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.

1041
01:23:37,667 --> 01:23:39,999
They know people
are listening.

1042
01:23:40,103 --> 01:23:41,832
They want
the detonators,

1043
01:23:41,938 --> 01:23:44,099
or they're
going to kill me.

1044
01:23:46,509 --> 01:23:49,069
John, didn't you
hear me?

1045
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,441
Yeah, I hear you.

1046
01:23:53,549 --> 01:23:55,176
John, get
with the program.

1047
01:23:55,284 --> 01:23:56,683
Tell these guys...

1048
01:23:56,786 --> 01:23:58,185
where
the detonators are...

1049
01:23:58,287 --> 01:24:00,346
so no one else
gets hurt!

1050
01:24:00,456 --> 01:24:03,357
I'm putting my life
on the line, pal!

1051
01:24:03,459 --> 01:24:05,188
Ellis,
listen to me carefully.

1052
01:24:05,294 --> 01:24:06,556
John...

1053
01:24:06,662 --> 01:24:08,527
Shut up, Ellis!
Just shut your mouth!

1054
01:24:08,631 --> 01:24:10,826
Put Hans back on!

1055
01:24:10,933 --> 01:24:15,029
Hans, this shithead doesn't
know you, but I do...

1056
01:24:15,138 --> 01:24:18,039
Good. Then you'll
give us what we want.

1057
01:24:18,141 --> 01:24:20,541
You're not part
of this equation.

1058
01:24:20,643 --> 01:24:23,669
What am I,
a method actor?

1059
01:24:23,779 --> 01:24:25,178
Put away the gun.

1060
01:24:25,281 --> 01:24:27,044
This is radio,
not television.

1061
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:30,551
Hans, he's not my friend!
I don't know him!

1062
01:24:30,653 --> 01:24:32,553
Jesus, Ellis!
They'll kill you!

1063
01:24:32,655 --> 01:24:34,885
Tell them
you don't know me!

1064
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:38,449
How can you say that
after all these years?

1065
01:24:38,561 --> 01:24:42,497
John? John?

1066
01:25:04,587 --> 01:25:06,350
Do you hear that?

1067
01:25:06,455 --> 01:25:09,515
Talk to me! Where
are my detonators?

1068
01:25:09,625 --> 01:25:11,024
Where are they,

1069
01:25:11,127 --> 01:25:13,118
or shall I shoot
another one?

1070
01:25:13,229 --> 01:25:14,628
Sooner or later,

1071
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:17,028
I'll get to someone
you care about.

1072
01:25:17,133 --> 01:25:19,363
Go fuck
yourself, Hans.

1073
01:25:21,604 --> 01:25:23,265
Did you hear that?

1074
01:25:23,372 --> 01:25:26,535
He just let
the guy die, man.

1075
01:25:26,642 --> 01:25:29,042
Man, can't you see
what's happening?

1076
01:25:29,145 --> 01:25:31,545
Can't you read
between the lines?

1077
01:25:31,647 --> 01:25:33,046
He did everything
he could...

1078
01:25:33,149 --> 01:25:34,548
to save him.

1079
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:37,551
If he gave up,
they'd both be dead!

1080
01:25:37,653 --> 01:25:39,985
No. They'd be
talking to us.

1081
01:25:40,089 --> 01:25:43,490
You tell your partner
to stay out of this.

1082
01:25:43,593 --> 01:25:44,992
If he doesn't,

1083
01:25:45,094 --> 01:25:46,493
I'm going to
nail his ass.

1084
01:25:46,596 --> 01:25:48,496
The man is hurting.

1085
01:25:48,598 --> 01:25:50,498
He is alone, tired,

1086
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:52,693
and he hasn't seen
diddly-squat...

1087
01:25:52,802 --> 01:25:54,201
from anybody here!

1088
01:25:54,303 --> 01:25:56,999
You think
he'll give a damn...

1089
01:25:57,106 --> 01:26:00,041
about what you do
<i>if</i> he makes it?

1090
01:26:00,142 --> 01:26:02,838
Wake up and smell
what you shoveling.

1091
01:26:02,945 --> 01:26:05,846
Anytime you want
to go home,

1092
01:26:05,948 --> 01:26:08,314
you consider
yourself dismissed.

1093
01:26:08,417 --> 01:26:11,011
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.

1094
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:11,686
<i>Attention, police.</i>

1095
01:26:11,721 --> 01:26:13,018
<i>Attention, police.</i>

1096
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:16,884
Attention, police.

1097
01:26:16,993 --> 01:26:19,188
This is Sergeant
Al Powell...

1098
01:26:19,295 --> 01:26:21,695
This is deputy chief
Dwayne Robinson.

1099
01:26:21,797 --> 01:26:23,731
Who is this?

1100
01:26:23,833 --> 01:26:25,357
This is Hans Gruber.

1101
01:26:25,468 --> 01:26:28,699
I assume you realize
the futility of direct action.

1102
01:26:28,804 --> 01:26:32,137
We have no wish
for further loss of life.

1103
01:26:32,241 --> 01:26:35,233
Well, what is it
you do wish for?

1104
01:26:35,344 --> 01:26:37,539
I have comrades
around the worid...

1105
01:26:37,647 --> 01:26:39,376
languishing
in prison.

1106
01:26:39,482 --> 01:26:41,313
The American
State Department...

1107
01:26:41,417 --> 01:26:43,817
enjoys rattling its saber
for itself.

1108
01:26:43,919 --> 01:26:46,820
Now it can rattle it
for me.

1109
01:26:46,922 --> 01:26:50,483
The following are to be
released from their captors...

1110
01:26:50,593 --> 01:26:54,290
The seven members
of the New Provo Front,

1111
01:26:54,397 --> 01:26:58,959
in Canada, the five imprisoned
leaders of <i>Liberté du Quebec,</i>

1112
01:26:59,068 --> 01:27:02,504
in Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.

1113
01:27:02,605 --> 01:27:04,539
What the fuck?

1114
01:27:06,642 --> 01:27:09,338
I read about them
in <i>Time</i> magazine.

1115
01:27:09,445 --> 01:27:12,846
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

1116
01:27:12,948 --> 01:27:15,849
the hostages will be
taken to the roof...

1117
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:18,351
and will accompany us
in helicopters...

1118
01:27:18,454 --> 01:27:20,854
to the Los Ángeles
International Airport...

1119
01:27:20,956 --> 01:27:23,186
where they'll be given
further instructions.

1120
01:27:23,292 --> 01:27:25,852
You have two hours
to comply.

1121
01:27:25,961 --> 01:27:27,690
Wait a minute,
Mr. Gruber.

1122
01:27:27,797 --> 01:27:29,196
This is crazy.

1123
01:27:29,298 --> 01:27:30,697
I don't have
the authority.

1124
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,200
Two hours
is not enough.

1125
01:27:33,302 --> 01:27:36,533
Hello? Hello!

1126
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:38,539
Did you get
all that?

1127
01:27:38,641 --> 01:27:40,836
We got to make
some calls.

1128
01:27:40,943 --> 01:27:43,104
Do you think
they'll try?

1129
01:27:43,212 --> 01:27:44,645
Who cares?

1130
01:27:47,583 --> 01:27:49,778
Theo, are we
on schedule?

1131
01:27:49,885 --> 01:27:52,581
One more. Then
it's up to you.

1132
01:27:52,688 --> 01:27:55,282
This one will
take a miracle.

1133
01:27:55,391 --> 01:27:56,790
It's Christmas, Theo.

1134
01:27:56,892 --> 01:28:00,089
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer.

1135
01:28:00,196 --> 01:28:03,097
Call me when you hit
the last lock.

1136
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:07,932
Hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

1137
01:28:08,037 --> 01:28:11,131
Fritz is checking
the explosives.

1138
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:12,901
I'll check
the explosives.

1139
01:28:13,008 --> 01:28:15,340
Hey, Powell,
you out there?

1140
01:28:15,444 --> 01:28:18,572
I'm here, John.
I'm here.

1141
01:28:18,681 --> 01:28:22,117
Believe me, there was
nothing I could do.

1142
01:28:22,218 --> 01:28:24,618
It's gonna be
both our asses...

1143
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:26,244
if you're wrong.

1144
01:28:26,355 --> 01:28:28,016
I hear you.

1145
01:28:33,129 --> 01:28:36,155
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

1146
01:28:36,265 --> 01:28:38,529
It doesn't
make sense, man.

1147
01:28:38,634 --> 01:28:40,659
I'm just
a desk jockey...

1148
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:44,171
who was on my way
home when you rang.

1149
01:28:44,273 --> 01:28:45,672
The way you drove,

1150
01:28:45,775 --> 01:28:48,141
I figured you
for the street.

1151
01:28:48,244 --> 01:28:50,906
In my youth.
In my youth.

the early stages
of the Helsinki Syndrome.

1157

Basically, it's when

01:29:10,933 --> 01:29:12,332
and the terrorists...

1161

go through a sort of
psychological transference...

1162

The FBI is here now?

01:29:40,062 --> 01:29:42,189
Yes, sir.
Right over there.

1174
01:29:42,298 --> 01:29:43,060
Hold this.

01:29:43,165 --> 01:29:45,463

doing, man?

I'm Agent Johnson.

01:29:53,075 --> 01:29:54,474
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1179
01:29:54,577 --> 01:29:56,477
Oh, how you doing?

1180
01:29:56,579 --> 01:29:58,137
No relation.

1181
01:29:58,247 --> 01:29:59,475
I'm, uh...

01:29:59,582 --> 01:30:01,482
I'm Dwayne Robinson,
L.A.P.D.

1183
01:30:01,584 --> 01:30:04,485
I'm in charge here.

1184
01:30:04,587 --> 01:30:06,145
Not anymore.

1185
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:05,171
Hi there.
How you doing?

1186
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:10,350
Ooh...

1187
01:31:10,452 --> 01:31:13,683
Please, God. You're
one of them, aren't you?

1188
01:31:13,789 --> 01:31:15,848
You're one of them.

1189
01:31:15,958 --> 01:31:19,018
No! Don't kill me!
No, please.

1190
01:31:19,128 --> 01:31:21,858
Don't kill me,
please! No!

1191
01:31:21,964 --> 01:31:24,398
Relax. I'm not
going to hurt you.

1192
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:25,967
I won't hurt you!

1193
01:31:28,971 --> 01:31:30,871
Oh, God.

1194
01:31:32,474 --> 01:31:35,307
What the fuck are
you doing up here?

1195
01:31:35,411 --> 01:31:37,379
What were you
looking for?

1196
01:31:37,479 --> 01:31:40,380
I managed to get
out of there.

1197
01:31:40,482 --> 01:31:43,883
I was trying to get
up on the roof...

1198
01:31:43,986 --> 01:31:46,887
and see if I could
signal for help.

1199
01:31:46,989 --> 01:31:49,116
Why don't you
come and help?

1200
01:31:49,224 --> 01:31:52,387
Hold it. Hold it.
Forget the roof.

1201
01:31:52,494 --> 01:31:53,893
Forget the roof.

1202
01:31:53,996 --> 01:31:56,396
They got people
all over it.

1203
01:31:56,498 --> 01:31:59,626
You want to stay alive,
you stay with me.

1204
01:32:02,538 --> 01:32:05,029
The best
we can figure it,

1205
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:08,041
we've got maybe 30 or 35
hostages up there,

1206
01:32:08,143 --> 01:32:10,043
probably
on the 30th floor,

1207
01:32:10,145 --> 01:32:13,911
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.

1208
01:32:14,016 --> 01:32:16,075
Sounds like
an A-7 scenario.

1209
01:32:16,185 --> 01:32:17,914
We'll handle it
from here.

1210
01:32:18,020 --> 01:32:19,419
When we
commandeer your men,

1211
01:32:19,521 --> 01:32:20,954
we'll let you know.

1212
01:32:21,056 --> 01:32:22,455
Aren't you...

1213
01:32:22,558 --> 01:32:23,923
forgetting something?

1214
01:32:24,026 --> 01:32:24,924
Such as?

1215
01:32:25,027 --> 01:32:26,460
What about
John McClane?

1216
01:32:26,562 --> 01:32:27,961
He's the reason...

1217
01:32:28,063 --> 01:32:29,655
we have
any information.

1218
01:32:29,765 --> 01:32:31,528
He's also the reason...

1219
01:32:31,634 --> 01:32:33,363
you're only facing
seven terrorists.

1220
01:32:33,469 --> 01:32:35,835
He's inside?
Who is he?

1221
01:32:35,938 --> 01:32:38,839
He might be a cop.
We're checking.

1222
01:32:38,941 --> 01:32:40,272
One of yours?

1223
01:32:40,376 --> 01:32:41,434
No way.

1224
01:32:46,315 --> 01:32:47,942
You smoke?

1225
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:50,883
Yeah.

1226
01:32:55,491 --> 01:32:56,549
Thanks.

1227
01:33:00,996 --> 01:33:03,658
You don't work
for Nakatomi.

1228
01:33:06,502 --> 01:33:09,699
And if you're not
one of them...

1229
01:33:11,874 --> 01:33:14,365
I'm a cop
from New York.

1230
01:33:16,011 --> 01:33:17,911
New York?

1231
01:33:18,013 --> 01:33:22,245
Yeah. Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.

1232
01:33:22,351 --> 01:33:24,148
Who knew?

1233
01:33:30,125 --> 01:33:34,221
<i>Well, it's better than being caught</i>
<i>with your pants down, huh?</i>

1234
01:33:44,373 --> 01:33:45,635
I'm John McClane.

1235
01:33:46,975 --> 01:33:49,876
<i>You're, uh...</i>

1236
01:33:49,978 --> 01:33:51,036
Clay.

1237
01:33:52,981 --> 01:33:54,676
Bill Clay.

1238
01:33:59,988 --> 01:34:02,980
Know how to use
a handgun, Bill?

1239
01:34:03,092 --> 01:34:06,061
I spent a weekend
at a combat ranch...

1240
01:34:06,161 --> 01:34:08,789
The guns that shoot
red paint.

1241
01:34:08,897 --> 01:34:12,890
Probably seems
kind of stupid to you.

1242
01:34:13,001 --> 01:34:14,093
Nope.

1243
01:34:16,004 --> 01:34:18,495
Time for the real
thing, Bill.

1244
01:34:27,182 --> 01:34:30,618
All you got to do
is pull the trigger.

1245
01:34:49,972 --> 01:34:51,872
Put down the gun...

1246
01:34:51,974 --> 01:34:54,340
and give me
my detonators.

1247
01:34:58,947 --> 01:35:01,814
Well, well, well...

1248
01:35:01,917 --> 01:35:03,248
Hans.

1249
01:35:03,352 --> 01:35:06,788
Put it down now.

1250
01:35:10,425 --> 01:35:13,326
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.

1251
01:35:13,428 --> 01:35:16,454
You ought to be
on fucking TV.

1252
01:35:18,934 --> 01:35:23,200
What do you want
with the detonators, Hans?

1253
01:35:23,305 --> 01:35:26,274
I already used
all the explosives...

1254
01:35:27,810 --> 01:35:29,607
or did I?

1255
01:35:29,711 --> 01:35:32,305
I'm going to
count to three.

1256
01:35:32,414 --> 01:35:33,346
Yeah.

1257
01:35:33,448 --> 01:35:35,075
Like you did
with Takagi?

1258
01:35:36,185 --> 01:35:37,083
Oops.

1259
01:35:38,987 --> 01:35:40,477
No bullets.

1260
01:35:40,589 --> 01:35:43,422
- What do you think...
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

1261
01:35:43,525 --> 01:35:44,492
You we're saying?

1262
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:39,678
Karl.

1263
01:36:48,690 --> 01:36:51,318
Shoot the glass!

1264
01:37:24,459 --> 01:37:26,791
Jesus Christ!

1265
01:37:55,324 --> 01:37:58,384
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.

1266
01:38:01,196 --> 01:38:03,494
<i>... is the last resort</i>
<i>of diplomacy,</i>

1267
01:38:03,598 --> 01:38:05,828
<i>couldn't we</i>
<i>just as well say...</i>

1268
01:38:05,934 --> 01:38:08,266

1269
01:38:08,370 --> 01:38:10,304
<i>on being that, too?</i>

1270
01:38:10,405 --> 01:38:13,169
You got something.
Tell me you got something.

1271
01:38:13,275 --> 01:38:16,005
Just McClane's name,
badge number, employment record,

1272
01:38:16,111 --> 01:38:18,705
vital statistics,
and his family's home address,

1273
01:38:18,814 --> 01:38:21,214
right here in L.A.

1274
01:38:21,316 --> 01:38:23,841
Woo!

1275
01:38:29,091 --> 01:38:30,854
Go to work.

1276
01:38:30,959 --> 01:38:32,358
You got it.

1277
01:38:44,306 --> 01:38:46,206
God!
That man looks...

1278
01:38:46,308 --> 01:38:47,866
really pissed.

1279
01:38:49,478 --> 01:38:51,878
He's still alive.

1280
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:53,880
What?

1281
01:38:53,982 --> 01:38:58,043
Only John can drive
somebody that crazy.

1282
01:39:14,002 --> 01:39:16,596
Hans, you better
heat up that miracle.

1283
01:39:16,705 --> 01:39:19,265
We broke through
on number six.

1284
01:39:19,374 --> 01:39:22,036
The electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.

1285
01:39:22,144 --> 01:39:25,341
See what our friends
outside are doing,

1286
01:39:25,447 --> 01:39:27,381
and I'll be right up.

1287
01:39:28,884 --> 01:39:30,784
Hey, John.
John McClane,

1288
01:39:30,886 --> 01:39:32,786
you still with us?

1289
01:39:32,888 --> 01:39:34,287
Yeah.

1290
01:39:34,389 --> 01:39:35,788
All things being equal,

1291
01:39:35,891 --> 01:39:38,291
I'd rather be
in Philadelphia.

1292
01:39:38,393 --> 01:39:41,226
Chalk up
two more bad guys.

1293
01:39:41,329 --> 01:39:43,229
Well, the boys
down here...

1294
01:39:43,331 --> 01:39:45,731
will be glad
to hear that.

1295
01:39:45,834 --> 01:39:48,735
We got a pool
going on you.

1296
01:39:48,837 --> 01:39:50,737
What kind of odds
am I getting?

1297
01:39:50,839 --> 01:39:53,239
<i>- You don't want to know.</i>
- Put me down for 20.

1298
01:39:53,341 --> 01:39:55,707
I'm good for it.

1299
01:39:57,345 --> 01:40:00,678
<i>Hey, pal, you got flat feet?</i>

1300
01:40:02,684 --> 01:40:05,778
What the hell are
you talking about?

1301
01:40:05,887 --> 01:40:08,788
Something had to
get you off the street.

1302
01:40:08,890 --> 01:40:10,790
You don't think
jockeying papers...

1303
01:40:10,892 --> 01:40:12,826
is a noble effort?

1304
01:40:14,629 --> 01:40:16,028
<i>No.</i>

1305
01:40:19,134 --> 01:40:21,034
I had an accident.

1306
01:40:21,136 --> 01:40:24,833
<i>The way you drive,</i>
<i>I can see why.</i>

1307
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:27,374
You run over
your captain's foot?

1308
01:40:30,645 --> 01:40:32,579
I shot a kid.

1309
01:40:32,681 --> 01:40:35,081
<i>He was 13 years old.</i>

1310
01:40:35,183 --> 01:40:38,084
Oh, it was dark.
I couldn't see him.

1311
01:40:38,186 --> 01:40:41,155
<i>Oh, it was dark.</i>
<i>He had a ray gun that</i>
<i>looked real enough.</i>

1312
01:40:44,659 --> 01:40:46,524
When you're a rookie,
they can teach you...

1313
01:40:46,628 --> 01:40:48,027
everything
about being a cop,

1314
01:40:48,130 --> 01:40:50,098
except how to live
with a mistake.

1315
01:40:53,635 --> 01:40:56,035
<i>Anyway, I just</i>
<i>couldn't bring myself...</i>

1316
01:40:56,138 --> 01:40:59,767
<i>to draw my gun</i>
<i>on anybody again.</i>

1317
01:41:01,643 --> 01:41:03,543
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

1318
01:41:03,645 --> 01:41:07,547
Hey, man,
how could you know?

1319
01:41:09,651 --> 01:41:12,814
I feel like shit
anyway.

1320
01:41:12,921 --> 01:41:16,448
Well, then,
this won't matter.

1321
01:41:16,558 --> 01:41:18,583
<i>The L.A.P.D. is not...</i>

1322
01:41:18,693 --> 01:41:21,127
<i>calling the shots</i>
<i>down here anymore.</i>

1323
01:41:23,165 --> 01:41:24,860
The feds?

1324
01:41:24,966 --> 01:41:26,365
You got it.

1325
01:41:28,003 --> 01:41:32,064
All right.
Those are the city engineers.

1326
01:41:32,174 --> 01:41:35,075
They're going into
the street circuits.

1327
01:41:35,177 --> 01:41:37,577
<i>Those guys in the suits,</i>
<i>I don't know who they are.</i>

1328
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:39,146
<i>That's the FBI.</i>

1329
01:41:39,247 --> 01:41:41,078
They're ordering
the others...

1330
01:41:41,183 --> 01:41:43,083
to cut
the building's power.

1331
01:41:43,185 --> 01:41:45,653
Regular
as clockwork.

1332
01:41:47,189 --> 01:41:49,089
Or a time lock.

1333
01:41:49,191 --> 01:41:51,455
<i>Precisely.</i>

1334
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:53,926
The circuits
that cannot be cut...

1335
01:41:54,029 --> 01:41:55,428
are cut automatically...

1336
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:57,930
in response to
a terrorist incident.

1337
01:41:58,033 --> 01:41:59,933
You asked for miracles.

1338
01:42:00,035 --> 01:42:03,061
I give you the FBI.

1339
01:43:24,757 --> 01:43:25,815
It's going to go!

1340
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:29,018
Yes!

1341
01:43:51,584 --> 01:43:52,983
Merry Christmas.

1342
01:43:54,887 --> 01:43:57,651
Those bastards are probably
pissing in their pants.

1343
01:43:57,756 --> 01:43:59,917
The mayor will
have my ass.

1344
01:44:06,599 --> 01:44:07,998
Woo!

1345
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:23,575
What will we do now?

1346
01:44:23,682 --> 01:44:26,515
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?

1347
01:44:26,619 --> 01:44:28,519
We've shut them down.

1348
01:44:28,621 --> 01:44:30,020
We let them sweat,

1349
01:44:30,122 --> 01:44:32,056
then give them
helicopters.

1350
01:44:32,158 --> 01:44:34,023
Right up the ass.

1351
01:44:36,128 --> 01:44:39,962
This is Agent Johnson.
No, the other one.

1352
01:44:40,065 --> 01:44:42,966
I want air support
ready in five minutes.

1353
01:44:43,068 --> 01:44:44,831
Damn right.
Fully armed.

1354
01:44:44,937 --> 01:44:46,802
<i>We're on the way.</i>

1355
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:54,671
Yeah!

1356
01:44:54,780 --> 01:44:58,682
I wish to talk to the FBI.

1357
01:45:01,086 --> 01:45:03,554
This is
Special Agent Johnson.

1358
01:45:03,656 --> 01:45:05,556
The State Department
has arranged...

1359
01:45:05,658 --> 01:45:08,092
for the return
of your comrades.

1360
01:45:08,194 --> 01:45:10,992
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

1361
01:45:11,096 --> 01:45:12,495
We'll be ready.

1362
01:45:12,598 --> 01:45:13,997
When he realizes
what hit him,

1363
01:45:14,099 --> 01:45:15,623
he'll be dead.

1364
01:45:15,734 --> 01:45:18,635
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

1365
01:45:18,737 --> 01:45:20,637
By the time
they figure out...

1366
01:45:20,739 --> 01:45:22,138
what went wrong,

1367
01:45:22,241 --> 01:45:24,175
we'll be sitting
on a beach...

1368
01:45:24,276 --> 01:45:25,538
earning 20%.

1369
01:45:30,115 --> 01:45:32,015
Ah! Jeez!

1370
01:45:32,117 --> 01:45:35,746
Powell?
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

1371
01:45:37,456 --> 01:45:39,185
I'm here, John.

1372
01:45:40,893 --> 01:45:44,294
I'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.

1373
01:45:44,396 --> 01:45:47,297
I want you to do
something for me.

1374
01:45:47,399 --> 01:45:48,957
Um...

1375
01:45:49,068 --> 01:45:51,969
I want you
to find my wife.

1376
01:45:52,071 --> 01:45:53,971
Don't ask me how.

1377
01:45:54,073 --> 01:45:56,974
I want you
to tell her something.

1378
01:45:57,076 --> 01:45:59,977
I want you
to tell her that...

1379
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:01,478
Um...

1380
01:46:03,082 --> 01:46:04,481
Mmm...

1381
01:46:06,585 --> 01:46:10,487
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out...

1382
01:46:10,589 --> 01:46:12,489
what a jerk I'd been,

1383
01:46:12,591 --> 01:46:15,992
but, um... that...

1384
01:46:20,099 --> 01:46:23,500
that when things started
to pan out for her,

1385
01:46:23,602 --> 01:46:26,503
I should have been
more supportive,

1386
01:46:26,605 --> 01:46:28,470
and, uh...

1387
01:46:28,574 --> 01:46:31,668
I just should have
been behind her more.

1388
01:46:34,613 --> 01:46:36,513
Oh, shit.

1389
01:46:39,118 --> 01:46:41,951
Tell her that, um...

1390
01:46:42,054 --> 01:46:44,955
that she's the best thing
that ever happened...

1391
01:46:45,057 --> 01:46:46,957
to a bum like me.

1392
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:51,461
She's heard me say
"I love you"

1393
01:46:51,563 --> 01:46:52,962
a thousand times.

1394
01:46:53,065 --> 01:46:55,966
She never heard me
say "I'm sorry."

1395
01:46:57,569 --> 01:47:00,470
I want you to
tell her that, Al.

1396
01:47:00,572 --> 01:47:02,972
I want you
to tell her...

1397
01:47:03,075 --> 01:47:05,976
that John said
that he was sorry.

1398
01:47:06,078 --> 01:47:08,478
Okay?
You got that, man?

1399
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:10,912
Yeah, I got it, John,

1400
01:47:11,016 --> 01:47:13,985
but you can
tell her that yourself.

1401
01:47:14,086 --> 01:47:16,987
Just watch your ass
and make it out.

1402
01:47:17,089 --> 01:47:18,488
You hear me?

1403
01:47:18,590 --> 01:47:21,582
I guess that's up to
the man upstairs.

1404
01:47:25,097 --> 01:47:28,999
John? John?

1405
01:47:29,101 --> 01:47:30,500
What the fuck...

1406
01:47:30,602 --> 01:47:32,001
were you doing
upstairs, Hans?

1407
01:47:34,106 --> 01:47:35,505
John?

1408
01:47:35,607 --> 01:47:37,006
Al, listen.

1409
01:47:37,109 --> 01:47:38,736
Just lay off
for a while.

1410
01:47:38,844 --> 01:47:42,109
<i>I got to go</i>
<i>check on something.</i>

1411
01:47:46,185 --> 01:47:48,949
One minute,
that's all I'm asking...

1412
01:47:49,054 --> 01:47:51,579
One minute
to speak to them.

1413
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:53,954
All right.
Get back. Get back.

1414
01:47:54,059 --> 01:47:55,959
All right,
look, look, look.

1415
01:47:56,061 --> 01:48:02,125
- Let me in right now,
or I call the I.N. S<i>. ¿Comprende?</i>

1416
01:48:02,234 --> 01:48:03,462
This is the last time
these kids will have...

1417
01:48:03,569 --> 01:48:05,469
to speak
to their parents.

1418
01:48:07,573 --> 01:48:08,972
- All right?
- Mm.

1419
01:48:09,074 --> 01:48:11,736
All right.
Come on.

1420
01:48:21,253 --> 01:48:23,619
What were you
doing, Hans?

1421
01:48:23,722 --> 01:48:26,088
What were you doing?

1422
01:48:47,646 --> 01:48:50,706
Jesus, Mary,
Mother of God.

1423
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,547
It's a double-cross!

1424
01:48:56,655 --> 01:48:58,555
The roof is wired to...

1425
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:02,558
John?

1426
01:49:05,164 --> 01:49:06,062
John!

1427
01:49:07,299 --> 01:49:09,062
John, come in!

1428
01:49:09,168 --> 01:49:11,068
Did you get that?

1429
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:13,070
Something about
a double-cross.

1430
01:49:13,172 --> 01:49:15,572
Tell me about it.

1431
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:23,080
We are both
professionals.

1432
01:49:25,184 --> 01:49:27,084
This is personal.

1433
01:49:28,687 --> 01:49:30,086
Ah...

1434
01:49:31,390 --> 01:49:33,449
Aagh!

1435
01:49:44,503 --> 01:49:46,334
Aah!

1436
01:49:51,009 --> 01:49:52,026
They're coming!

1437
01:49:52,061 --> 01:49:53,043
They're coming!

1438
01:49:53,145 --> 01:49:55,045
The choppers
are coming.

1439
01:49:55,147 --> 01:49:56,546
Okay,

1440
01:49:56,648 --> 01:49:59,549
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.

1441
01:49:59,651 --> 01:50:03,451
<i>Your mom and dad</i>
<i>are very important people.</i>

1442
01:50:03,555 --> 01:50:05,853
<i>They're very brave people.</i>

1443
01:50:05,958 --> 01:50:09,291
<i>Is there something</i>
<i>you'd like to say to them?</i>

1444
01:50:09,394 --> 01:50:12,830
Come home.

1445
01:50:19,771 --> 01:50:22,569
Mrs. McClane.

1446
01:50:24,676 --> 01:50:29,807
How nice to make
your acquaintance.

1447
01:50:32,751 --> 01:50:34,651
Everyone
to the roof!

1448
01:50:34,753 --> 01:50:36,983
Lock them there.
Come right back.

1449
01:50:44,196 --> 01:50:45,094
Ah!

1450
01:51:04,182 --> 01:51:07,174
You should have heard
your brother squeal...

1451
01:51:07,286 --> 01:51:10,346
when I broke
his fucking neck!

1452
01:51:13,759 --> 01:51:16,125
What do you
figure the breakage?

1453
01:51:16,228 --> 01:51:18,128
We take out
the terrorists,

1454
01:51:18,230 --> 01:51:21,461
lose 20, 25%
of the hostages... tops.

1455
01:51:21,567 --> 01:51:23,467
I can live
with that.

1456
01:51:23,569 --> 01:51:26,060
Get this thing
on the deck.

1457
01:51:26,171 --> 01:51:29,470
They're expecting
transports, not gun ships.

1458
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,147
Move it!

1459
01:51:43,255 --> 01:51:45,120
Come on! Move!

1460
01:51:45,223 --> 01:51:47,157
Move it!

1461
01:51:47,259 --> 01:51:49,159
Go! Move!

1462
01:51:52,264 --> 01:51:53,663
Theo.

1463
01:51:53,765 --> 01:51:55,665
A little bonus for us.

1464
01:51:55,767 --> 01:51:57,166
Please, sit down.

1465
01:51:57,269 --> 01:51:58,668
Sit down!

1466
01:51:58,770 --> 01:52:01,671
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.

1467
01:52:01,773 --> 01:52:04,674
McClane, I have
some news for you.

1468
01:52:04,776 --> 01:52:06,801
McClane.

1469
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:07,844
Ah!

1470
01:52:13,619 --> 01:52:15,314
Aah!

1471
01:52:17,189 --> 01:52:18,679
Come on! Move!

1472
01:52:20,292 --> 01:52:21,691
Come on!

1473
01:52:30,636 --> 01:52:32,433
Yaah!

1474
01:52:34,306 --> 01:52:36,866
Motherfucker!
I'll kill you!

1475
01:52:40,245 --> 01:52:41,644
Armed.

1476
01:52:41,747 --> 01:52:43,146
The truck?

1477
01:52:43,248 --> 01:52:44,647
The truck.

1478
01:52:51,023 --> 01:52:52,650
After all
your posturing,

1479
01:52:52,758 --> 01:52:54,658
all your little
speeches,

1480
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:58,321
you're nothing
but a common thief.

1481
01:52:58,430 --> 01:53:00,660
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs. McClane,

1482
01:53:00,766 --> 01:53:02,597
and since I'm moving
up to kidnapping,

1483
01:53:02,701 --> 01:53:04,669
you should be
more polite.

1484
01:53:06,204 --> 01:53:07,262
Yaah!

1485
01:53:10,275 --> 01:53:11,765
Oh!

1486
01:53:11,877 --> 01:53:13,970
Going to kill you!

1487
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:15,979
I'm going to
fucking cook you!

1488
01:53:16,081 --> 01:53:17,309
Going to fucking
eat you!

1489
01:53:40,005 --> 01:53:41,996
I don't
like this, Sarge.

1490
01:53:50,115 --> 01:53:52,515
Yaa-hah!

1491
01:53:52,617 --> 01:53:54,517
Just like
fucking Saigon,

1492
01:53:54,619 --> 01:53:56,177
Hey, slick?

1493
01:53:56,288 --> 01:54:00,019
I was in junior high,
dickhead.

1494
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,719
Where's Holly?

1495
01:54:29,821 --> 01:54:31,220
Where's Holly Gennero?

1496
01:54:31,323 --> 01:54:33,223
Holly Gennero?
Where's Holly?

1497
01:54:33,325 --> 01:54:35,225
Where's Holly?
Where is she?

1498
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:36,726
They took her!
Where?

1499
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:38,227
The vault!
Where
is the vault?

1500
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:40,161
The 30th floor!

1501
01:54:40,265 --> 01:54:41,664
They took her!

1502
01:54:41,767 --> 01:54:43,394
Get downstairs!

1503
01:54:43,502 --> 01:54:47,666
The whole fucking roof
is wired to blow!

1504
01:54:47,773 --> 01:54:50,936
Get down!
Get the fuck downstairs!

1505
01:54:52,611 --> 01:54:54,511
They made us, Bureau.
You got a terrorist
shooting at hostages.

1506
01:54:54,613 --> 01:54:55,910
Break left!

1507
01:55:03,522 --> 01:55:05,012
Nail that sucker!

1508
01:55:13,331 --> 01:55:16,266
I'm on your side,
you assholes!

1509
01:55:16,368 --> 01:55:17,801
Swing around again!

1510
01:55:17,903 --> 01:55:19,393
I'll bag
this little bastard.

1511
01:55:38,356 --> 01:55:40,187
What the fuck...

1512
01:55:42,294 --> 01:55:45,195
Oh, John, what the fuck
are you doing?

1513
01:55:45,297 --> 01:55:48,698
How the fuck did you
get into this shit?

1514
01:55:50,235 --> 01:55:53,568
Aah! Aah!

1515
01:55:53,672 --> 01:55:55,833
Aah!

1516
01:55:55,941 --> 01:55:58,009
Aah!

1517
01:55:58,109 --> 01:56:01,510
There's something wrong!
They're coming back down!

1518
01:56:01,613 --> 01:56:02,637
Blow the roof.

1519
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:03,975
Karl's up there!

1520
01:56:04,082 --> 01:56:05,071
Blow the roof!

1521
01:56:08,553 --> 01:56:11,454
I promise
I will never even think...

1522
01:56:11,556 --> 01:56:14,320
about going up
in a tall building again.

1523
01:56:16,595 --> 01:56:19,564
Oh, God,
please don't let me die!

1524
01:56:33,578 --> 01:56:35,068
Yaah!

1525
01:57:03,942 --> 01:57:05,876
Oh!

1526
01:57:24,896 --> 01:57:25,954
Aah!

1527
01:57:26,064 --> 01:57:27,258
Aah!

1528
01:57:51,723 --> 01:57:53,623
Holy Christ!

1529
01:57:54,726 --> 01:57:55,750
We're
going to need...

1530
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:57,987
some more
FBI guys, I guess.

1531
01:57:58,096 --> 01:57:59,927
Aah! Aah!

1532
01:58:10,809 --> 01:58:12,936
Jesus fucking Christ!

1533
01:58:13,044 --> 01:58:14,443
Fuck!

1534
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:41,504
What the fuck
is going on?

1535
01:58:42,807 --> 01:58:44,399
What are you going to do?

1536
01:58:44,509 --> 01:58:46,067
Sit here while
the building falls?

1537
01:58:54,586 --> 01:58:56,315
Shit!

1538
01:58:56,421 --> 01:58:57,911
Oh! All right!

1539
01:58:58,023 --> 01:58:59,422
Uli.

1540
01:58:59,524 --> 01:59:00,889
Hey!
Hey!

1541
01:59:00,992 --> 01:59:02,926
Hang on, baby.

1542
01:59:03,028 --> 01:59:05,428
Hang on, honey.

1543
01:59:05,530 --> 01:59:07,293
Oh, God.

1544
01:59:39,998 --> 01:59:41,226
Oh!

1545
01:59:45,370 --> 01:59:46,234
<i>Allez! Allez vite!</i>

1546
01:59:46,337 --> 01:59:48,669
<i>J'y vais!</i>
<i>J'y vais!</i>

1547
01:59:52,577 --> 01:59:54,101
Hans!

1548
02:00:08,259 --> 02:00:10,489
Jesus.

1549
02:00:10,595 --> 02:00:12,426
Hi, honey.

1550
02:00:33,985 --> 02:00:37,079
So that's what this
is all about?

1551
02:00:37,188 --> 02:00:38,587
A fucking robbery?

1552
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:40,521
Put down the gun.

1553
02:00:40,625 --> 02:00:44,561
Why'd you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

1554
02:00:44,662 --> 02:00:46,562
Well, when
you steal $600,

1555
02:00:46,664 --> 02:00:47,688
you can disappear.

1556
02:00:47,799 --> 02:00:49,699
When you steal
600 million,

1557
02:00:49,801 --> 02:00:50,768
they'll find you...

1558
02:00:50,869 --> 02:00:53,269
unless they think
you're already dead.

1559
02:00:53,371 --> 02:00:55,236
Put down the gun.

1560
02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:04,239
Uh.

1561
02:01:05,884 --> 02:01:07,374
<i>Nein.</i> This is mine.

1562
02:01:09,487 --> 02:01:11,421
You got me.

1563
02:01:11,523 --> 02:01:15,482
<i>Still the cowboy,</i>
<i>Mr. McClane.</i>

1564
02:01:15,593 --> 02:01:16,992
Americans, all alike.

1565
02:01:17,095 --> 02:01:19,723
This time, John Wayne doesn't
walk off into the sunset...

1566
02:01:19,831 --> 02:01:21,264
with Grace Kelly.

1567
02:01:21,366 --> 02:01:23,197
That was Gary Cooper,
asshole.

1568
02:01:23,301 --> 02:01:25,064
Enough jokes.

1569
02:01:25,170 --> 02:01:26,569
You'd have made...

1570
02:01:26,671 --> 02:01:28,036
a good cowboy
yourself, Hans.

1571
02:01:28,139 --> 02:01:29,538
Oh, yeah.

1572
02:01:29,641 --> 02:01:32,769
What was it you said
to me before?

1573
02:01:32,877 --> 02:01:36,369
Yippee-kai-yay,
motherfucker.

1574
02:01:57,435 --> 02:01:58,697
Holly!

1575
02:02:03,508 --> 02:02:05,703
Happy trails, Hans.

1576
02:02:10,915 --> 02:02:11,882
Aah!

1577
02:02:11,983 --> 02:02:12,881
Holly.

1578
02:02:14,953 --> 02:02:17,080
Aah!

1579
02:02:50,255 --> 02:02:52,314
I hope that's
not a hostage.

1580
02:03:20,652 --> 02:03:24,144
<i>Water hook-up</i>
<i>companies 93, 96...</i>

1581
02:03:24,255 --> 02:03:25,916
<i>Must have burned down</i>
<i>the whole building.</i>

1582
02:03:28,026 --> 02:03:30,426
Over here.
It's a better angle.

1583
02:03:30,528 --> 02:03:32,359
Let's give them...

1584
02:03:34,465 --> 02:03:37,366
Keep it going, now.
Keep it going.

1585
02:03:42,974 --> 02:03:45,374
Come on.
We're going to miss it!

1586
02:03:45,476 --> 02:03:47,376
Okay.
Hand me my notes!

1587
02:04:07,265 --> 02:04:08,664
Come on, folks.

1588
02:04:08,766 --> 02:04:11,166
What was it like
in there?

1589
02:04:11,269 --> 02:04:13,533
How did they
treat you?

1590
02:04:59,117 --> 02:05:01,517
Al, this is
my wife Holly.

1591
02:05:01,619 --> 02:05:03,018
Holly Gennero.

1592

Holly McClane.

1593
02:05:04,622 --> 02:05:06,385
Hello, Holly.

1594
02:05:06,491 --> 02:05:08,891
You got yourself
a good man.

1595
02:05:08,993 --> 02:05:11,359
You take
good care of him.

1596
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:14,120
<i>McClane!</i>

1597
02:05:14,232 --> 02:05:16,132
McClane,
I want a debriefing!

1598
02:05:16,234 --> 02:05:17,633
You got some things...

1599
02:05:17,735 --> 02:05:19,134
to answer for,
mister...

1600
02:05:19,237 --> 02:05:21,501
Ellis' murder,
for one thing,

1601
02:05:21,606 --> 02:05:22,868
<i>property damage,</i>

1602

1603
02:06:04,415 --> 02:06:07,350
<i>All right!</i>
<i>Two of you go inside...</i>

1604

<i>- Yes, sir...</i>

1605
02:06:20,131 --> 02:06:22,031
This one's with me.

1606
02:06:32,143 --> 02:06:33,542
Mr. McClane.
Mr. McClane!

1607

After this
incredible ordeal,

1608
02:06:36,447 --> 02:06:38,472
what are
your feelings?

1609
02:06:42,453 --> 02:06:45,479
Well, well, well.

1610
02:06:45,590 --> 02:06:47,490
Merry Christmas,
Argyle.

1611
02:06:47,592 --> 02:06:48,820
Merry Christmas.

1612
02:06:51,762 --> 02:06:53,992
Did you get that?

1613
02:06:54,098 --> 02:06:55,497
Let me through.

1614
02:06:55,600 --> 02:06:58,501
If this is their idea
of Christmas,

1615
02:06:58,603 --> 02:07:01,504
I got to be here
for New Year's.

1616
02:07:05,510 --> 02:07:08,968
<i># Oh, the weather outside</i>

1617
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:12,846
<i>#But the fire</i>

1618
02:07:12,950 --> 02:07:16,784
<i>#And since we've</i>

1619
02:07:16,888 --> 02:07:18,871

1620
02:07:18,906 --> 02:07:20,854

1621
02:07:20,958 --> 02:07:24,325
<i>#It doesn't show signs</i>

1622
02:07:24,428 --> 02:07:28,023
<i>#And I brought</i>

1623
02:07:28,132 --> 02:07:31,761
<i># The lights are turned</i>

1625
02:07:35,573 --> 02:07:39,270

1626
02:07:39,377 --> 02:07:43,108

1627
02:07:43,214 --> 02:07:47,310

1629
02:07:51,155 --> 02:07:53,988

1630
02:07:54,091 --> 02:07:58,391
