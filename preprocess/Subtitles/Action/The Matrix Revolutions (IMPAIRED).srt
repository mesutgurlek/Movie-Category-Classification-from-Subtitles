1
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,707
I got nothing, sir.
No sign of Niobe or Ghost.

2
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,417
Nothing but blue pills.

3
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,252
Should we try to contact them?

4
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,379
Won't matter.
My gut says they're down.

5
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,632
- We should start back.
- If that ship can fly, we need it.

6
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,259
I was afraid you'd say that.

7
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,095
ROLAND: Search every pipe, every hole,
every crack we know.

8
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,723
Sweep as wide as possible,
as fast as possible.

9
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,602
- Lines are crawling with calamari.
- Then the sooner we find them the better.

10
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,776
Thought you could use
something to eat.

11
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,653
Thank you.

12
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,364
Any change?

13
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,242
No.

14
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:03,122
- How is he?
- He's gonna be fine.

15
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,916
At least until he wakes up.

16
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:10,254
- What do you mean?
- Captain has some questions for him.

17
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,590
He'd better have some good answers.

18
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,926
You see these cuts?
I think they're self-inflicted.

19
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:20,181
- Why?
- VDTs maybe. I don't know.

20
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,643
But like I said,
the answer better be good.

21
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,982
MORPHEUS: Roland, I'd like to run
another search through the Matrix.

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,401
- For what?
- For Neo.

23
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,780
How could he be in the Matrix, sir?
He's not plugged in.

24
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,281
Please, for me.

25
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,503
This is what keeps bothering me.

26
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,672
What?

27
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,550
MAGGIE: His neural patterns don't read
like someone who's in a coma.

28
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,637
The strange thing is,
I see these patterns all the time.

29
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:03,140
- Where?
- On someone jacked in.

30
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:18,155
The big bupkes. Nada.
He's not in there.

31
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,533
COLT: Sir, I got the projections.
ROLAND: How long?

32
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:25,246
Based on point of entry and past speed,
the machines will be in Zion in 20 hours.

33
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,040
Jesus H. Christ.

34
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,837
All right, let's move with a purpose.
AK, I want you on holographics.

35
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,173
Mauser, I want forward and aft guns
manned at all times.

36
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,467
Make sure we're running
on as few pads as possible.

37
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,511
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

38
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:43,806
- Hey! You got a call.
ROLAND: What?

39
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,351
Operator.

40
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,104
It's Seraph.

41
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,525
I bring word from the Oracle.
You must come at once.

42
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,998
Good morning.

43
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:13,753
- Who are you?
- My name is Sati. Your name is Neo.

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,007
My papa says you're not supposed
to be here. He says you must be lost.

45
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,177
Are you lost, Neo?

46
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,392
- Where am I?
- This is the train station.

47
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,482
- This isn't the Matrix?
- That's where the train goes.

48
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,943
That's where we're going,
but you cannot go with us.

49
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,072
- Why not?
- He won't let you.

50
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,786
- Who won't?
- The Trainman. I don't like him.

51
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,289
But my papa says we have to do
what the Trainman says...

52
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:54,376
...or else he will leave us here
forever and ever.

53
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:13,604
Morpheus, Trinity,
thank you for coming.

54
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,565
One thing I've learned in all my years...

55
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,819
...is that nothing ever works out
the way you want it to.

56
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,072
- Who are you?
- I'm the Oracle.

57
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:30,079
I wish there was an easy way to get
through this, but there ain't.

58
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,123
I'm sorry this had to happen.

59
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,877
I'm sorry I couldn't be sitting here
like you remember me...

60
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,964
...but it wasn't meant to be.
- What happened?

61
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:45,094
I made a choice, and that choice
cost me more than I wanted it to.

62
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,637
What choice?

63
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,932
To help you, to guide Neo.

64
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,020
Now, since the real test for any choice is
having to make the same choice again...

65
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,024
...knowing full well
what it might cost...

66
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,777
...I guess I feel pretty good
about that choice...

67
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:06,240
...because here I am, at it again.

68
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,286
- Do you know what happened to Neo?
- Yes.

69
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,165
He is trapped in a place between
this world and the machine world.

70
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,670
The link is controlled by a program
called the Trainman.

71
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:24,383
He uses it to smuggle programs
in and out of the Matrix.

72
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,720
If he finds out where Neo is
before you get to him...

73
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,348
...then I'm afraid our choices
are going to become difficult.

74
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,685
- Why?
- Because of who the Trainman works for.

75
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,687
The Merovingian.

76
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:41,400
He has placed a bounty on your lives.
You must be careful at all times.

77
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:46,155
Seraph knows how to find the Trainman.
He'll go with you.

78
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,075
For years he has protected me.

79
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,745
I hope he can do the same for you.

80
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,582
Please, follow me.

81
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,213
Oracle...

82
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,591
I know, Morpheus.

83
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,511
I can see you're filled with doubt,
clouded by uncertainty.

84
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,308
After everything that has happened,
how can you expect me to believe you?

85
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,226
I don't.

86
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:19,063
I expect just what I've always expected:

87
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,525
For you to make up your own
damn mind. Believe me or don't.

88
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:29,114
All I can do is tell you that your friend
is in trouble, and he needs your help.

89
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,701
He needs all our help.

90
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,788
- Are you from the Matrix?
- Yes.

91
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,289
No.

92
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,377
- I mean, I was.
- Why did you leave?

93
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,547
- I had to.
- I had to leave my home too.

94
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,468
Sati! Come here, darling.
Leave the poor man in peace.

95
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,136
Yes, Papa.

96
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,645
I am sorry. She is still very curious.

97
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,607
- I know you.
- Yes, in the restaurant of the Frenchman.

98
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:08,487
I am Rama-Kandra. This is my wife,
Kamala. My daughter, Sati.

99
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,656
We are most honored to meet you.

100
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,450
- You are programs.
- Oh, yes.

101
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:18,080
I am the power-plant systems manager
for recycling operations.

102
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:22,334
My wife is an interactive software
programmer. She is highly creative.

103
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,004
What are you doing here?
You do not belong here.

104
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:30,092
Kamala! Goodness, I apologize.
My wife can be very direct.

105
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,845
It's okay.

106
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,680
I don't have an answer.

107
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,392
- I don't even know where "here" is.
RAMA: This place is nowhere.

108
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,353
It is between your world and our world.

109
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,858
- Who's the Trainman?
- He works for the Frenchman.

110
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,235
Why did I know
you were going to say that?

111
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:52,364
The Frenchman does not forget,
and he does not forgive.

112
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,409
- You know him?
- I know only what I need to know.

113
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:59,538
I know if you want to take something
from our world into your world...

114
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,958
...that does not belong there,
you must go to the Frenchman.

115
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,752
Is that what you're doing here?

116
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,881
- Rama, please.
- I do not want to be cruel, Kamala.

117
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,633
He may never see another face
for the rest of his life.

118
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,844
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,306
- You don't have to answer that question.
- No, I don't mind.

120
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,225
The answer is simple.

121
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,192
I love my daughter very much.

122
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,904
I find her to be the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

123
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,782
But where we are from,
that is not enough.

124
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,618
Every program that is created
must have a purpose.

125
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,163
If it does not, it is deleted.

126
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,000
I went to the Frenchman
to save my daughter.

127
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,922
- You do not understand.
- I just have never...

128
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,466
Heard a program speak of love.

129
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:57,596
- It is a human emotion.
- No, it is a word.

130
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:02,142
What matters is the connection
the word implies.

131
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,564
I see that you are in love.

132
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,111
Can you tell me what you would give
to hold on to that connection?

133
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,612
Anything.

134
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,781
Then perhaps the reason you are here...

135
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,243
...is not so different
than the reason I am here.

136
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,877
That's him.

137
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,881
- Get away! Get away from me!
- We don't want trouble.

138
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,968
- Get the hell away from me!
- We need your help.

139
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,721
I can't help you!
No one can help you!

140
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,905
[GUN SHOOTING]

141
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,191
Oh, no!

142
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,163
Damn it!

143
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:53,212
- When is the train due?
- It is already late.

144
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,589
It's not like the Trainman to be late.

145
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,217
You think it has something
to do with me?

146
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,718
I cannot say.

147
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,721
Who knows such things?
Only the Oracle.

148
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,766
- You know the Oracle?
- Everyone knows the Oracle.

149
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,685
I consulted with her
before I met with the Frenchman.

150
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,396
She promised she'd look after Sati
after we said goodbye.

151
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,565
Goodbye?

152
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,401
- You're not staying with her?
RAMA: It is not possible.

153
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,614
Our arrangement with the Frenchman
was for our daughter only.

154
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,243
- My wife and I must return to our world.

00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,958
Then I think it's time for me to know
a few more things.

313
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,876
So do I.

314
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,964
Tell me how I separated my mind
from my body without jacking in.

315
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,883
Tell me how I stopped four sentinels
by thinking it.

316
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,138
Tell me just what the hell
is happening to me.

317
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:25,810
The power of the One
extends beyond this world.

318
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:29,522
It reaches from here all the way back
to where it came from.

319
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,941
- Where?
- The source.

320
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:36,779
That's what you felt when you touched
those sentinels, but you weren't ready.

321
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:42,910
You should be dead, but apparently
you weren't ready for that either.

322
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,665
The Architect told me that
if I didn't return to the source...

323
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,667
...Zion would be destroyed tonight.

324
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:54,172
Please. You and I may not be able
to see beyond our own choices...

325
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,091
...but that man can't see
past any choice.

- Why not?
- He doesn't understand them. He can't.

327
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,182
To him, they are variables
in an equation.

328
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:08,394
One at a time, each variable
must be solved, then countered.

329
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:12,273
That's his purpose.
To balance the equation.

330
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,817
What's your purpose?

331
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,028

Why? What do you want?

I want the same thing you want, Neo.

334
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,454
And I'm willing to go
as far as you are to get it.

335
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,457
The end of the war.

336
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,500
Is it going to end?

337

One way or another.

338
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:38,341
Can Zion be saved?

339

I'm sorry, I don't have the answer
to that question, but...

340
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:49,268
If there is an answer, there's only
one place you're going to find it.

341
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,146
- Where?
- You know where.

342

And if you can't find the answer...

343

...then I'm afraid there may be
no tomorrow for any of us.

344

What does that mean?

345

Everything that has a beginning...

00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,503
...has an end.

00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:18,589

But I believe he won't stop there.
He can't.

354

He won't stop until
there's nothing left at all.

from the Nebuchadnezzar?

467
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,689
None, and at this point there's no reason
to expect there will be.

468
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,858
Perhaps.

469
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,443
But we can hope.

470
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,030
I'm afraid hope is an indulgence
I don't have time for.

471
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,878
- Zee, what are you doing?
- Making shells.

472
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,714
They're evacuating our level.
We have to go.

473
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,217
- I'm not going with you.
- What?

474
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,887
They've called for volunteers
to hold the dock.

475
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,977
Kids, you stay here.

476
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,314
I know how you feel,
but you can't do this.

477
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,483
- I have to.
CAS: Why?

478
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,819
Because I love him.

479
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,863
I love him the same as he loves me.

480
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,367
And if I were out there and he
were here, I know what he'd do.

481
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:39,830
But you're gonna get yourself killed.
It's crazy, Zee.

482
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:45,168
Maybe it is. But ask yourself,
if it were Dozer...

483
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,214
...and you knew the only chance you had
to see him was to hold the dock...

484
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,508
...what would you do?

485
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,557
Make shells.

486
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:12,195
What the shit is going on over here?

487
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,907
An accident, sir. I didn't see...

488
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,201
- I'm sorry.
- Who the hell are you?

489
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,662
A unit volunteer, sir.

490
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:25,042
What's a pod-born pencil-neck like you
doing volunteering for my Corps?

491
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,212
I want to do my part, sir.
We gotta hold the dock.

492
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,674
- How old are you, kid?
- Eighteen.

493
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,969
Should have said 16,
I might have believed that.

494
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,554
Okay, I'm 16.

495
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:41,308
Minimum age for the Corps is 18.
Sixteen's too young.

496
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:46,313
The machines don't care how old I am.
They'll kill me just the same.

497
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,815
Ain't that the goddamn truth.

498
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:52,611
Give me a chance, sir.
I won't let you down.

499
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,696
You do...

500
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:58,492
...and you'll find me and the machines
have got something in common.

501
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,091
Okay, charge the igniter.

502
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,140
She lives again.

503
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:25,602
Want us to patch an uplink to reload
the operations software, Sparky?

504
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:29,106
That'd be swell. Could you clean
the windshield while you're at it?

505
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,530
SPARKS: Uplinks in place.
I'm bringing her back online.

506
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,449
Looking good, except, uh...

507
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,328
Something's wrong
with the Matrix feed.

508
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,706
No, there's not. You're looking
at what we're looking at.

509
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,377
SPARKS: What's going on in there?
- Whatever it is, it can't be good.

510
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,380
ROLAND:
The machines have taken Junction 21.

511
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,425
The way I see it, if we drop down
from broadcast here...

512
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,220
...intersect 153, we might surprise them.

513
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:04,975
We'll go first, hammer as deep
as we can, then blow our EMP.

514
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:09,146
Hopefully we can punch a hole
big enough for you to get through.

515
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:15,485
It ain't pretty, but the way I see it,
it's the only way back.

516
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,154
No, it's not.

517
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,407
There's another way. A support line.

518
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:24,327
It drops down right here,
1000 meters short of 21.

519
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,540
If we're lucky, we may be able to
slip down without them ever knowing.

520
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,126
That's a mechanical line.
It's impossible.

521
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,336
- No one can pilot mechanical.
- I can.

522
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,505
- Bullshit.
- I've done it.

523
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,925
- That was a long time ago, Niobe.
- I said I can do it.

524
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:43,722
So what? You'll be the only one that can.
There's no way we can follow you.

525
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,809
Hi.

526
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:54,024
I know time is always against us.
I'm sorry that I took so long.

527
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:57,986
- But I wanted to be sure.
- Sure of what?

528
00:44:58,154 --> 00:45:00,280
- I know what I have to do.
- What?

529
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:03,700
There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

530
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:06,536
- I have to take one of the ships.
- What?

531
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,455
To go where?

532
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,749
To the machine city.

533
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,253
[LAUGHS]

534
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:17,547
I know it's difficult to understand.

535
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,258
No, it's not. You're out
of your goddamn mind.

536
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,885
I still have to go.

537
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:25,263
In 100 years, no ship has been
within 100 kilometers of it.

538
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:28,141
- You'll never make it.
- I have to try.

539
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,311
- Is this what the Oracle has told you?
- No.

540
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,814
This is asinine. If you want
to kill yourself, do it...

541
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,067
...but do it without
wasting our ships.

542
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,195
- You have to believe me. I have to go.
- Bullshit!

543
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:43,573
I am the captain of this ship.
I say where it has to go!

544
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,577
And this ship will go to hell
long before I let you take it anywhere.

545
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:55,252
- He can take mine.
- You can't do that.

546
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:59,214
Don't try to tell me
what I can or cannot do...

547
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:01,675
...with my ship
after that little speech.

548
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:06,263
- But for chrissake, Niobe...
- I'll pilot this ship, he can take mine.

549
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:10,433
If we leave inside the hour,
we'll reach Zion as the machines do.

550
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,144
That's as good a plan as any.

551
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:17,065
It's a waste. A goddamn waste.

552
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,782
Two ships, two directions.

553
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,119
Sounds like providence,
doesn't it, Morpheus?

554
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,956
- You've never believed in the One.
- I still don't.

555
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,833
Then why are you doing this?

556
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,044
I believe in him.

557
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,881
Thank you.

558
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,806
- What's that for?
- To help you relax.

559
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,809
To make it easier for you to remember.

560
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,645
What if I don't want to remember?

561
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,732
Why would you want that?

562
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,985
What if I blew that EMP?

563
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,988
What if I did destroy those ships...

564
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:09,951
...and I am responsible
for the deaths of all those men?

565
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,998
If I did that...

566
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:18,918
...it wouldn't be very safe
for me here, would it?

567
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,595
[GROANING]

568
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:33,016
Of course, it might not be
very safe for you either.

569
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,026
I'm ready.

570
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,112
NEO:
Trinity...

571
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,699
...there's something I have to say.

572
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:55,622
Something you need to understand.

573
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,667
I know I'm supposed to go.

574
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,128
But beyond that...

575
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,548
...I don't know. I...

576
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:09,636
I know. You don't think
you're coming back.

577
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:16,267
I knew it the moment you said you had
to leave. I could see it in your face.

578
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,104
Just like you knew the moment
you looked at me...

579
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,648
...that I was coming with you.

580
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,485
I'm scared, Trin.

581
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,779
So am I.

582
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,242
It took me 10 minutes
to buckle up one boot.

583
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,328
But I'll tell you something.

584
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,415
Six hours ago, I told the Merovingian...

585
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,584
...I was ready to give anything
and everything for you.

586
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,714
Do you know what's changed
in the last six hours?

587
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,425
No.

588
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,301
Nothing.

589
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,984
ROLAND: Finished loading ammunition?
- Just about.

590
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,486
Let's move it. We are out of time.

591
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:10,947
You're not leaving them anything?

592
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,283
He said he didn't need it.

593
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:20,623
I ain't saying goodbye.
I'm saying good luck.

594
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,876
Thank you.

595
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,633
I can only hope you know
what you're doing.

596
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,218
Me too.

597
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:37,974
It was an honor, sir.

598
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,314
No, the honor is still mine.

00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:01,247
MAUSER: We're ready, sir.
- About damn time.

600
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:06,044
We're already late, captain,
so let's hit it and hit it hard.

00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,674
Bye, baby.

602
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,676
Take good care of them.

Ready?

00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,085
Engine's still firing.

Must be a fuse. I'll check it out.

I should've known he'd
send his bitch first.

00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,689
Bane.

608
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:10,984
No one ever got away from me
as many times as you did.

609
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,152
Every time, I thought it was the last.

610
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,156
Every time, I was sure we had you,
but you'd slip through our fingers.

611
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:21,911
I really can't express
just how aggravating that can be.

612
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,248
What are you talking about?

613
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:30,670
I think I might enjoy killing you
as much as killing him.

614
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:49,772
Neo, it's Bane. He's psychotic!

615
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:53,192
You're gonna pay for that.

- It's Maggie, sir.
