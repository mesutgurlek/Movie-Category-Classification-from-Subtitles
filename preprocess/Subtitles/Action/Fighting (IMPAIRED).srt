00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:26,857
and we're going to
talk about everything.

473
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,025
Shawn.

474
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,861
You know, we lost a lot of money
betting on your ass to get beat tonight.

475
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,280
Well, maybe you'll bet
the right way next time.

476
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,949
(MEN SNICKERING)

477
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,700
And what's the
right way to bet?

478
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,537
'Cause, you know, I wipe
my ass with a hundred $100s.

479
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,122
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey, hey. Just have a seat.

480
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,833
I'll be over
there in a second.

481
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,586
Come on, Jerry.

482
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,223
Excuse me,
we're sitting here.

483
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,393
You're Evan Hailey,
right?

484
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,895
Yeah, and you're
wearing contacts.

485
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,149
Holy shit.
Shawn MacArthur.

486
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,986
(CHUCKLING) I'm sorry,
man, is this your girl?

487
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,153
No. Uh-uh.

488
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,240
So what brings you
to New York, man?

489
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,075
Well, just...

490
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,827
Martinez.
How you doing, man?

491
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,413
Hi, bud, I know who you are. But
you have to excuse me for a second,

492
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,332
I'm just... I'm bugging
out a little bit right now.

493
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,667
You all two
know each other?

494
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,669
I know who you are.

495
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,299
Yeah. Yeah,
we know each other.

496
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:38,053
I used to wrestle for Shawn's
father back in Birmingham, Alabama.

497
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,514
So how is your father?
Yeah? I'm sure he's fine.

498
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,724
Mmm-hmm.

499
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,769
You know, I'm going to let you
all have a good night, okay?

500
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,813
I'm gonna go ahead
and get out of here.

501
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,024
Hey, come on, man.

502
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,942
Relax, man,
come on, sit down.

503
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,402
Hey. Don't touch me.

504
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,528
(MEN CHUCKLING)

505
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,196
"Don't touch."
You know what...

506
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,365
You worried about your jacket?
Huh? That's the problem?

507
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,492
I'll buy you a new one,
how's that?

508
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,536
I don't need your jacket. No?

509
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,371
HARVEY: Hey, is
everything okay over here?

510
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,497
Harvey.

511
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,124
These two guys are
old friends, man.

512
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,001
Evan just was offering
to buy him a new jacket.

513
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,669
I said I didn't
need a jacket.

514
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,796
Come on, Shawn, look.

515
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,132
You guys.
I'm Harvey Boarden.

516
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,760
Harvey Boarden,
go wash my car, man.

517
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,304
You know, somebody
might hurt you

518
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,847
for doing something
like that.

519
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,183
That somebody
going to be you?

520
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,400
Come on, let's go.

521
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,696
MARTINEZ:
You should go, Harvey.

522
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,200
You're bad, man.

523
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,415
Yeah, Harvey,
you can go now.

524
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,378
Neolithic-looking idiot.
Always saying my damn name.

525
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:57,466
My daddy used to tell me, "Nothing
good happens after 10:00 p. M."

526
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,010
It's got to be damn
near 2:00 now.

527
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,595
Right?
Yeah.

528
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,766
You knew that guy, huh?

529
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,644
Yeah, he used to wrestle
for my dad's team.

530
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,770
Really?

531
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,647
You know,
I'm gonna go, okay?

532
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,440
Well, where you going?

533
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,608
What, you need
a friend now?

534
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,693
What?

535
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,986
I'm just gonna
go for a walk.

536
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,039
Okay.

537
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,847
MAN: Good night, Zulay.
WOMAN: Good night, Zulay.

538
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,515
Good night.

539
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,494
Zulay. Like July?

540
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,663
(CHUCKLES)

541
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,124
Yeah, that's right.
I say that right?

542
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,375
You did.

543
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,460
(LAUGHS)

544
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,628
I figured I'd take fate
into my own hands, you know.

545
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,339
And you did.
I have to go. I...

546
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,759
Nice seeing you, Shawn.

547
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,261
Oh, you called me
Shawn. That's cool.

548
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,305
Hey, you make sure
she gets home okay.

549
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,389
Okay. Thank you.

550
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,807
All right?

551
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,892
Thank you, Shawn.

552
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,894
Uh-oh! Don't use it again.

553
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,855
My name. That's good.
Good night.

554
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,684
Hey, King Arthur,
it's Merlin.

555
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,852
(CHUCKLING)

556
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,270
Hey, man.

557
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,231
What you doing here?

558
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,566
That's what I was
gonna ask you.

559
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,195
What time is it?

560
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,572
You fell asleep
on the bench.

561
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,491
You look like a crackhead.

562
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,659
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

563
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,495
I just sat down
for a second. And...

564
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,205
Wow.

565
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,499
I can't believe you just
saw me sleeping on the...

566
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,918
I just sat down,
just for a minute

567
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,295
and I don't know, I just
kind of went to sleep.

568
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,130
I can't believe it.

569
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:46,134
I've got an extra room at
my place. You can stay there.

570
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,386
Hey, hey, hey.
Look, I'm okay.

571
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,929
If you like.
No, you're not okay.

572
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,681
I was just about to
go to a hotel, man.

573
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,267
Yeah, 7:00 in
the morning.

574
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,144
They don't even check
you in until 1:00.

575
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,688
You don't have to
stay at a hotel,

576
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,648
I've got a place
right around the corner.

577
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:02,234
But you can stay there
until you find another place.

578
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,527
All right, look,
I'm gonna pay you.

579
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,571
Yeah, you're going to
pay me back for sure.

580
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,489
Come on,
grab your stuff.

581
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,534
If somebody saw you sleeping out
here, you know what they'd think?

582
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,953
We wouldn't make
no more money.

583
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,039
Nothing's free
in this world.

584
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,917
I just was there
for a minute or two.

585
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,503
Well, you're in deep
with Harvey Boarden now.

586
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,255
So we're going
to work it out.

587
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,800
Make sure you wipe your feet
on that carpet right there.

588
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,969
I'll shut the door.

589
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,599
Okay, so here we are.

590
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:38,145
Fresh paint job, new lamps.
It's all right for now.

591
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,521
Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

592
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,858
You know, for now, at least.
But anyway, here's your area.

593
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,069
That's a Sealy ostropedic.
I got that new.

594
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,113
You like Broadway? You know? Yeah.

595
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,908
'Cause I got tickets, you know,
like Legally Blonde and Wicked.

596
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,744
Wicked's a very good one.
I don't go too often,

597
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,496
but when I do,
I go and see that one.

598
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,332
Is that you?

599
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,625
(SHAWN LAUGHS)

600
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,919
Yeah, don't mind those,

601
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,172
that's me, Jack and
Martinez, you know, and...

602
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,174
Well, we were going to be
these moguls, you know?

603
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,092
We used to sell tickets
at the Garden.

604
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,761
It was when
we first got here.

605
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,262
So you ain't
from here, either?

606
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,599
Are you kidding me? I'm from
a place with some culture.

607
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,476
Chicago, you know?

608
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,229
But I guess you've got
your own story, too, right?

609
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,649
You left your suitcase
out here.

610
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,320
What, you got
gold in there?

611
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:32,658
My father used to always say, "Stay
business, ready for business."

612
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,203
Well, you got to...

613
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,456
So you got a plan
or something?

614
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,501
You know, like a big plan
with this fight stuff?

615
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:47,381
Yeah, I didn't travel all the way
to New York just to be some hustler.

616
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,301
I figured I'd save up some cash,
play some professional ball.

617
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,055
Open up a IHOP. You know,
with an office in it

618
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,682
and my name on the door.

619
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,977
(CHUCKLING) What, like an
International House of Pancakes?

620
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,186
(HARVEY CHUCKLES)

621
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,356
Turns out all I ever was
was a two-bit hustler.

622
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:09,486
Well. Guess that's not
so bad though, right?

623
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:13,699
Well, by definition, that's just
somebody who can't win, that wins.

624
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,325
We just won.

625
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,495
I'm just saying.
You know, if that's...

626
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,788

So how do you know all
those guys at the club?

1106
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,433
I don't. I...

1107
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,811
I don't even know
your name, really.

01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:33,313
What's your name?
Your last name?

01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,108
MacArthur.

1110
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:40,946
Shawn MacArthur. Like
a knight. I like it.

thinking about?

I can fix this for you.

Hmm?

01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,722
I want to fix
this for you.

It's not so bad.
You want to fix it?

for today.

about, Harvey?

make me say it?

Why didn't you tell me that
you were sleeping with him?

Why couldn't
you tell me that?

'Cause I don't have to tell
you everything. That's why.

paying your bills?

I did not ask him
to pay my bills.

daughter, you like him like that?

better than me, right?

No. That's...

1231

You think you're
better than me,

1232

head with all this garbage.

to you. Don't touch me.

Don't touch me.
Stop it.

1238
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:22,639
If he decides to up
and leave you tomorrow,

1239

you think you're
part of his plans?

your daughter is?

Maybe. What about your grandmother?

You're always so paranoid.

1243
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:33,900
Yeah, that's what I am,
I'm paranoid. I'm paranoid.

1244
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:36,402
You still believe
in fairy tales.

1245
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,158
But you think
I'm paranoid, okay.

1246
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:44,536
Does he know
how we met?

1247

You in the back seat,
sleeping in your car,

1248
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,208
with your daughter
in the front seat?

to be paranoid about?

1250

Okay.

You think that little thing
right here between your legs

1252
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,516
is gonna make everything
okay, don't you?

1253
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,476
That's what you think.

1254
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:09,894
It isn't.

1255
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:13,940
You use that on him.

01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:17,068
Don't put no more
garbage in his head.

1257

Yo, check this out, yo.

We're going to Birmingham.

1722
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:29,582
Okay...

1723
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:32,001
You know, we're going
to go and see my family.

1724
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:35,046
See what's left of it.
You know what I mean?

1725
01:41:35,714 --> 01:41:38,883
Maybe stop by Chicago,
or something.

1726
01:41:39,343 --> 01:41:43,096
On your way to
Birmingham, Chicago.

1727
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,514
Right. Yeah.

1728
01:41:44,973 --> 01:41:46,182
Mmm-hmm.

1729
01:41:48,602 --> 01:41:50,353
Why don't you come?

1730
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:08,871
So Birmingham is
where you're thinking?

1731
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:11,040
Yeah.
It's where I'm from.

1732
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:15,837
Okay, what we
should do, then...

1733
01:42:17,089 --> 01:42:18,131
Hear me out.

1734
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:21,676
I think we should go past
Birmingham to some place warm.

1735
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,302
If you're going all the way to Chicago,

1736
01:42:23,387 --> 01:42:25,638
through Birmingham,
whatever...

1737
01:42:25,722 --> 01:42:26,806
Take it to California.

1738
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:29,684
You know, they've got a whole lot
of great opportunities out there.

1739
01:42:29,768 --> 01:42:31,102
I've been doing
a lot of reading,

1740
01:42:31,186 --> 01:42:33,187
I'm not giving those
people this money.

1741
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:35,314
I don't give...
Unless...

1742
01:42:36,358 --> 01:42:39,318
We shouldn't give nobody none
of this. We should just go.

because my boyfriend is there.

1745
01:42:43,866 --> 01:42:47,702
"And then I change my mind,
maybe. Because love is beautiful."

ZULAY: Oh, my God.
ALBA: It's amazing, Alabama.

all shut up already?

1749
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:56,752
ALBA: You're driving me crazy.

1750

HARVEY: You're making
my ears bleed in here.

Harvey. It's raining.

1754
01:45:27,446 --> 01:45:30,823
Harvey, it's always raining.
It's raining, Harvey.

1755
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:33,826
It's just rain, rain.

1756
01:45:34,077 --> 01:45:37,204
It's always raining
in this raining town.

1757
01:45:37,456 --> 01:45:40,666
Always raining. What am I
supposed to do with the rain?

1758
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:42,585
Harvey, it's raining.

1759
01:45:43,128 --> 01:45:44,587
It's raining, Harvey.

01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:47,590
Harvey, it's raining.

1761
01:45:49,384 --> 01:45:52,178
Harvey, it's raining. What are
we going to do with the rain?

1762
01:45:52,262 --> 01:45:53,846
HARVEY: I know
it's raining, Mary.
