there is a scaffold.</i>

163
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,762
<i>- How do you know this?
- We don't have time.</i>

164
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,849
<i>To your left there's</i> a <i>window.
Go to it.</i>

165
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,644
<i>Open it.</i>

166
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,272
<i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>

167
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,108
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

168
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,735
<i>There are two ways
out of this building.</i>

169
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:47,781
<i>One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.</i>

170
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,243
<i>You take</i> a <i>chance either way.
I leave it to you.</i>

171
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,582
This is insane!

172
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,626
Why is this happening to me'?

173
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,545
Wha't'd I do?

174
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,673
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

175
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,717
I'm gonna die.

176
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:17,561
Shit!

177
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:38,999
Oh, shit!

178
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:45,714
I can't do this.

179
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,394
Shit.

180
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:53,490
As you can see, we've had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

181
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:57,452
It seems that you've been living...

182
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,830
...two lives.

183
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,750
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

184
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:07,337
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

185
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,675
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

186
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:13,385
And you...

187
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,599
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

188
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,229
The other life is lived in computers...

189
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:27,482
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

190
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:32,529
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

191
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,782
One of these lives...

192
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,868
...has a future.

193
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:40,204
And one of them does not.

194
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,753
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

195
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,088
You're here...

196
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,674
...because we need your help.

197
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,306
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

198
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,350
...individual.

199
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:06,313
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

200
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:11,318
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

201
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,987
He is considered by many authorities...

202
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:17,282
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

203
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,203
My colleagues...

204
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:24,581
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

205
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:28,293
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

206
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:32,089
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

207
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,591
...give you a fresh start.

208
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:38,011
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

209
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:41,765
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

210
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,393
Yeah.

211
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,771
That sounds like a really good deal.

212
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,149
But I got a better one.

213
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,901
How about...

214
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,320
...I give you the finger...

215
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,908
...and you give me my phone call.

216
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,954
Mr. Anderson...

217
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,168
...you disappoint me.

218
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:12,045
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

219
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,672
I know my rights.

220
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:15,424
I want my phone call.

221
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,177
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

222
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,470
...what good is a phone call...

223
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:24,308
...if you're unable to speak?

224
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,302
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

225
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,971
...whether you want to or not.

226
00:21:48,684 --> 00:21:50,686
[PHONE RINGS]

227
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:04,658
<i>MORPHEUS: This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.</i>

228
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:09,204
<i>They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.</i>

229
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,290
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

230
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,542
<i>you would probably be dead.</i>

231
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:18,255
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

232
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:23,343
<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...</i>

233
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:26,555
<i>...looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...</i>

234
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:28,307
<i>...looking for you.</i>

235
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,019
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

236
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,856
<i>- Yes.
- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

237
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,284
Get in.

238
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:00,380
What's this?

239
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:03,175
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

240
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,594
- From what?
- From you.

241
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,597
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

242
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:09,932
Stop the car.

243
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,687
Listen, coppertop.

244
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,940
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

245
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,817
Right now, there's only one rule:

246
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,444
Our way...

247
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:23,862
...or the highway.

248
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,495
Fine.

249
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:35,832
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

250
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,044
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

251
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,004
You know that road.

252
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,632
You know exactly where it ends.

253
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:48,095
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

254
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,819
Apoc, lights.

255
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:08,490
TRINITY: Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

256
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,661
- What's that?
- You're bugged.

257
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:21,879
Try and relax.

258
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,344
Come on.

259
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:31,430
Come on.

260
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:34,183
It's on the move.

261
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,186
Come on, you shit.

262
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,273
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

263
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,524
Clear!

264
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,243
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

265
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,320
This is it.

266
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:34,117
Let me give you one piece of advice.

267
00:25:35,077 --> 00:25:36,745
Be honest.

268
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,541
He knows more than you can imagine.

269
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:50,592
At last.

270
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,220
Welcome, Neo.

271
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,348
As you no doubt have guessed...

272
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:57,850
...I am Morpheus.

273
00:25:58,892 --> 00:26:00,477
It's an honor to meet you.

274
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:01,979
No...

275
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:03,856
...the honor is mine.

276
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,276
Please, come. Sit.

277
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,001
I imagine...

278
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:27,171
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

279
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:31,300
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

280
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:33,218
You could say that.

281
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:36,763
I can see it in your eyes.

282
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:40,642
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

283
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:43,145
...because he's expecting to wake up.

284
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:47,149
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

285
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:50,235
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

286
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:51,486
No.

287
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:52,946
Why not?

288
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:55,991
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

289
00:26:57,075 --> 00:27:00,412
I know exactly what you mean.

290
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,085
Let me tell you why you're here.

291
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,671
You know something.

292
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:11,840
What you know,
you can't explain.

293
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:13,926
But you feel it.

294
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,428
You felt it your entire life:

295
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:21,183
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

296
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,894
Like a splinter in your mind...

297
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:26,021
...driving you mad.

298
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:29,691
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

299
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:34,071
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

300
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:37,241
The Matrix?

301
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,411
Do you want to know...

302
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,872
...what it is?

303
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,126
The Matrix is everywhere.

304
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,087
It is all around us.

305
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,297
Even now, in this very room.

306
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:55,342
You can see it when you
look out your window...

307
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,928
...or when you turn on your television.

308
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:00,889
You can feel it when you go to work...

309
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,101
...when you go to church...

310
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:06,603
...when you pay your taxes.

311
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:10,649
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

312
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,484
...to blind you from the truth.

313
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:15,946
What truth?

314
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,743
That you are a slave.

315
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:25,539
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

316
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:30,460
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

317
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,045
A prison...

318
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:33,422
...for your mind.

319
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:42,764
Unfortunately, no one can be...

320
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:45,475
...told what the Matrix is.

321
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,814
You have to see it for yourself.

322
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:02,618
This is your last chance.

323
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:05,204
After this, there is no turning back.

324
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:07,122
You take the blue pill...

325
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,501
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

326
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,544
...whatever you want to believe.

327
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,129
You take the red pill...

328
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,340
...you stay in Wonderland...

329
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,551
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

330
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:30,646
Remember...

331
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,525
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

332
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,165
Follow me.

333
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:54,378
Apoc, are we on-line?

334
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:56,004
APOC:
Almost.

335
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:01,385
MORPHEUS:
Time is always against us.

336
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,262
Please take a seat there.

337
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,156
- You did all this?
TRINITY: Mm-hm.

338
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:29,288
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

339
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:34,668
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

340
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,253
What does that mean?

341
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:39,006
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

342
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,674
...because Kansas...

343
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:41,967
...is going bye-bYe-

344
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,256
Did you...?

345
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:36,355
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

346
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:40,400
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

347
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:43,153
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

348
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:45,197
...and the real world?

349
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:47,991
NEO:
This can't be.

350
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:49,201
MORPHEUS:
Be what?

351
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,411
Be real?

352
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:56,792
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

353
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,001
Still nothing.

354
00:31:58,585 --> 00:31:59,795
NEO:
It's cold.

355
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:01,421
It's cold!

356
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,969
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

357
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,139
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

358
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,850
APOC:
Targeting almost there.

359
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,563
He's going into arrest.

360
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:20,315
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

361
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:18,660
Welcome...

362
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:20,913
...to the real world.

363
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:24,166
MORPHEUS:
We've done it, Trinity.

364
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,959
We found him.

365
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,004
- I hope you're right.
MORPHEUS: I don't have to hope.

366
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:31,173
I know it.

367
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:37,387
Am I dead?

368
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:40,057
Far from it.

369
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:55,447
He still needs a lot of work.

370
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,075
What are you doing?

371
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:00,536
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

372
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,663
WW do my eyes hurt?

373
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:05,249
You've never used them before.

374
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:10,045
Rest, Neo.

375
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:11,964
The answers are coming.

376
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:24,203
[DOOR OPENS]

377
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:28,123
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

378
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:29,833
What is this place?

379
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:32,753
More important than "what" is "when."

380
00:37:33,253 --> 00:37:34,296
"When"?

381
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:36,548
You believe it's the year 1999...

382
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:39,051
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

383
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:42,930
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

384
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,806
...because we honestly don't know.

385
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:48,143
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

386
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:51,146
Come with me.
See for yourself.

387
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:53,440
MORPHEUS:
This is my ship.

388
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:56,652
The Nebuchadnezzar.
It's a hovercraft.

389
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:01,240
This is the main deck.

390
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:08,247
This is the core...

391
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:14,503
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

392
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:21,051
Most of my crew you already know.

393
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:27,474
This is Apoc...

394
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:29,601
...Switch...

395
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,354
-...and Cypher.
- Hi.

396
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:36,316
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

397
00:38:37,192 --> 00:38:39,611
The little one behind you is Mouse.

398
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:47,202
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

399
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,454
Trinity.

400
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:12,060
Try to relax.

401
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,775
This will feel a little weird.

402
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:32,122
This...

403
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:33,999
...is the Construct.

404
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,543
It's our loading program.

405
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:39,254
We can load anything, from clothing...

406
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:40,881
...to equipment...

407
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:42,508
...weapons...

408
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:44,968
...training simulations...

409
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,888
...anything we need.

410
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:53,101
NEO: Right now we're inside
a computer program?

411
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:55,312
Is it really so hard to believe?

412
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:58,440
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

413
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,735
Your hair has changed.

414
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,447
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

415
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,784
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

416
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:15,791
This isn't real?

417
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,584
What is "real"?

418
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,212
How do you define "real"?

419
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,422
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

420
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:25,092
...what you can smell, taste and see...

421
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:29,221
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

422
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:35,811
This is the world that you know.

423
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:40,274
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

424
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:46,989
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

425
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,490
...that we call the Matrix.

426
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:55,831
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

427
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,958
This is the world...

428
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,002
...as it exists today.

429
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:16,018
Welcome to "the desert...

430
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:18,478
...of the real."

431
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:24,234
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

432
00:41:24,484 --> 00:41:28,280
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century...

433
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,783
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

434
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:36,788
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to Al.

435
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:38,707
AI.

436
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,126
You mean artificial intelligence.

437
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:45,797
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

438
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:50,093
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

439
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:53,722
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

440
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,559
They were dependent on solar power...

441
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:01,146
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

442
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,983
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

443
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:10,113
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

444
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:15,786
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

445
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:23,418
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

446
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:27,798
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

447
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:31,885
Combined with a form of fusion...

448
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:37,057
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

449
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:44,857
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

450
00:42:45,107 --> 00:42:48,360
...where human beings
are no longer born.

451
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:50,904
We are grown.

452
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:59,538
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

453
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:02,457
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

454
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:05,419
...watched them liquefy the dead...

455
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:09,006
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

456
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:13,802
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

457
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:16,972
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

458
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,393
What is the Matrix?

459
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:23,645
Control.

460
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:28,400
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

461
00:43:29,193 --> 00:43:32,279
...built to keep us under control...

462
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:36,617
...in order to change a human being...

463
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:38,410
...into this.

464
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:40,913
No.

465
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:44,124
I don't believe it.

466
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:45,709
It's not possible.

467
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:50,881
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

468
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:52,424
S'tOp!

469
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:54,176
Let me out!

470
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:56,803
Let me out! I want out!

471
00:43:58,764 --> 00:44:01,433
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

472
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:03,352
Get this thing out of me!

473
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:06,647
Don't touch me!

474
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:08,524
Stay away from me!

475
00:44:08,941 --> 00:44:10,442
I don't believe it.

476
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:12,361
I don't believe it.

477
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:14,112
I don't believe it.

478
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:16,406
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

479
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:17,866
Just breathe.

480
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,053
I can't go back, can I?

481
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,305
No.

482
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:42,349
But if you could...

483
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:44,685
...would you really want to?

484
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:48,564
I owe you an apology.

485
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:50,524
We have a rule.

486
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:54,236
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

487
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:55,487
It's dangerous.

488
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:57,906
The mind has trouble letting go.

489
00:44:58,156 --> 00:45:00,450
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

490
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:03,579
I did what I did because...

491
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:05,747
...I had to.

492
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:18,260
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

493
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,556
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

494
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:25,851
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

495
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:31,064
It was he who freed the first of us...

496
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,567
...taught us the truth.

497
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:38,113
As long as the Matrix exists...

498
00:45:38,447 --> 00:45:40,532
...the human race will never be free.

499
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:46,288
After he died...

500
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:49,750
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

501
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:53,504
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

502
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:55,422
...end the war...

503
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:57,007
...bring freedom to our people.

504
00:45:58,342 --> 00:46:02,971
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

505
00:46:03,305 --> 00:46:04,890
...looking for him.

506
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:09,394
I did what I did because...

507
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:13,148
...I believe that search is over.

508
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:19,655
Get some rest.

509
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,074
You're going to need it.

510
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:25,827
For what?

511
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:30,082
Your training.

512
00:46:48,392 --> 00:46:50,102
Morning. Did you sleep?

513
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:52,187
You will tonight.

514
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:54,106
I guarantee it.

515
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:57,526
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

516
00:46:57,985 --> 00:47:00,404
- You don't have any--
- Holes? Nope.

517
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:06,034
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

518
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:07,494
Born free right here...

519
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:09,371
...in the real world.

520
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:11,290
Genuine child of Zion.

521
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:14,585
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

522
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:16,336
...Zion's where the party would be.

523
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:18,046
It's a city?

524
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:21,466
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

525
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:24,303
Where is it?

526
00:47:26,054 --> 00:47:29,474
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

527
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:32,978
You live long enough,
you might see it.

528
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:40,068
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

529
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,070
...if Morpheus is right and all.

530
00:47:42,571 --> 00:47:45,324
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

531
00:47:45,574 --> 00:47:46,992
...if you are...

532
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:50,078
...it's a very exciting time.

533
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:53,832
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

534
00:47:57,753 --> 00:48:00,672
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

535
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:05,135
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

536
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:06,929
How about...

537
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:10,265
...combat training?

538
00:48:16,313 --> 00:48:17,773
Jujitsu"?

539
00:48:18,649 --> 00:48:20,317
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

540
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:32,871
Holy shit!

541
00:48:33,121 --> 00:48:35,457
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

542
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,084
How about some more?

543
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:38,627
Hell, yes.

544
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:41,755
Hell, yeah.

545
00:48:53,934 --> 00:48:55,018
How is he?

546
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:57,437
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

547
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:10,033
I know kung fu.

548
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:12,703
Show me.

549
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:16,248
This is a sparring program...

550
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:19,293
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

551
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:21,879
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

552
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:25,591
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

553
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:27,634
Some of them can be bent.

554
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:30,304
Others can be broken.

555
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:31,930
Understand?

556
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:34,057
Then hit me...

557
00:49:34,641 --> 00:49:35,767
...if you can.

558
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:15,807
Good!

559
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:17,726
Adaptation.

560
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:19,228
Improvisation.

561
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,854
But your weakness...

562
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:22,481
...is not your technique.

563
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:31,532
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

564
00:51:43,812 --> 00:51:44,980
How did I beat you?

565
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:52,654
You're too fast.

566
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:54,531
Do you believe that...

567
00:51:54,907 --> 00:51:57,409
...my being stronger or faster...

568
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:01,330
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

569
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:07,169
You think you're breathing air?

570
00:52:20,682 --> 00:52:21,892
Again!

571
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:35,781
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

572
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:38,242
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

573
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:45,165
What are you waiting for?

574
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:47,376
You're faster than this.

575
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:51,797
Don't think you are.

576
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:53,715
Know you are.

577
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:06,895
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

578
00:53:16,822 --> 00:53:18,574
I don't believe it.

579
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:22,244
I know what you're trying to do.

580
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:26,081
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

581
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:28,500
But I can only show you the door.

582
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:30,919
You have to walk through it.

583
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:35,424
Tank, load the jump program.

584
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:49,730
You have to let it all go, Neo
Feat“

585
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:52,441
...doubt and disbelief.

586
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:56,320
Free your mind.

587
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:05,704
Whoa.

588
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:14,213
Okey-dokey.

589
00:54:16,298 --> 00:54:17,466
Free my mind.

590
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:19,051
What if he makes it?

591
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:22,012
- No one's ever made their first jump.
MOUSE: I know.

592
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:25,807
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

593
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:27,476
Come on.

594
00:54:27,726 --> 00:54:28,894
All right.

595
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:31,396
No problem. Free my mind.

596
00:54:32,189 --> 00:54:34,983
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

597
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:56,046
What does that mean?

598
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:58,257
It doesn't mean anything.

599
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:01,426
Everybody falls the first time.

600
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:03,178
Right, Trin?

601
00:55:23,866 --> 00:55:26,493
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

602
00:55:29,746 --> 00:55:31,999
If you're killed in the Matrix...

603
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:33,208
...you die here?

604
00:55:33,834 --> 00:55:36,295
The body cannot live without the mind.

605
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:10,162
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

606
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:16,084
There is something about him,
isn't there?

607
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,337
You're a believer now?

608
00:56:19,338 --> 00:56:20,547
I keep wondering...

609
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:24,468
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

610
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:28,305
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

611
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:39,650
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

612
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:42,694
That system is our enemy.

613
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:45,656
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

614
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:49,701
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

615
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,746
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

616
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:55,958
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

617
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:58,126
...and that makes them our enemy.

618
00:56:58,293 --> 00:56:59,503
You have to understand...

619
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:03,090
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

620
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,925
And many of them are so inert...

621
00:57:05,175 --> 00:57:07,594
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

622
00:57:07,845 --> 00:57:10,556
...that they will fight to protect it.

623
00:57:12,057 --> 00:57:15,811
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

624
00:57:15,978 --> 00:57:17,729
- I was--
- Look again.

625
00:57:18,981 --> 00:57:20,065
Freeze it.

626
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:28,323
NEO: This isn't the Matrix?
MORPHEUS: No.

627
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:33,954
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

628
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,999
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

629
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,335
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

630
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:45,382
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

631
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:49,136
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

632
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:50,804
...is potentially an agent.

633
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:53,599
Inside the Matrix...

634
00:57:54,183 --> 00:57:55,893
...they are everyone...

635
00:57:56,226 --> 00:57:57,936
...and they are no one.

636
00:57:58,187 --> 00:58:01,315
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

637
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:03,192
...but they are the gatekeepers.

638
00:58:03,442 --> 00:58:06,403
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

639
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:09,489
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

640
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:10,866
Someone?

641
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,618
MORPHEUS:
I won't lie to you, Neo.

642
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:17,915
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.

643
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:20,542
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

644
00:58:20,709 --> 00:58:21,793
Why?

645
00:58:22,044 --> 00:58:24,338
MORPHEUS: I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

646
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:28,175
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

647
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:33,055
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

648
00:58:33,305 --> 00:58:34,431
Because of that...

649
00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:38,060
...they will never be as strong

show you the door.

Hello, Neo.

817

You're right on time.

818

Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

819

Do not try and bend the spoon.

822
01:11:49,434 --> 01:11:51,562
That's impossible.

823
01:11:52,396 --> 01:11:56,400
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

824
01:11:56,942 --> 01:11:58,318
What truth?

There is no spoon.

There is no spoon?

that bends. It is only yourself.

I'll let you in on a little secret.

Being the One is just
like being in love.

No one can tell you you're in love.

Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

868

01:35:27,227 --> 01:35:28,437
What choice?

1138
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,942
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1139
01:35:34,276 --> 01:35:36,612
TRINITY: No, you're not.
- I have to.

1140
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:40,449
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1141
01:35:40,699 --> 01:35:42,618
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1142
01:35:43,202 --> 01:35:46,455
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1143
01:35:47,956 --> 01:35:48,999
What?

1144
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:51,335
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1145
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:54,671
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1146
01:35:54,922 --> 01:35:57,591
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1147
01:35:58,258 --> 01:35:59,510
No, Neo, that's not true.

1148
01:36:00,093 --> 01:36:02,721
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1149
01:36:07,142 --> 01:36:10,479
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1150
01:36:10,729 --> 01:36:15,108
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1151
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:20,322
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1152
01:36:20,572 --> 01:36:22,157
That's what it looks like...

1153
01:36:22,324 --> 01:36:23,367
...but it's not.

1154
01:36:23,617 --> 01:36:25,994
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1155
01:36:27,079 --> 01:36:30,791
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1156
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:34,044
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1157
01:36:34,336 --> 01:36:36,839
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1158
01:36:37,005 --> 01:36:38,632
What?

1159
01:36:39,341 --> 01:36:41,051
I believe I can bring him back.

1160
01:36:58,026 --> 01:36:59,945
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1161
01:37:00,237 --> 01:37:02,239
- No, you're not.
_IINOII?

1162
01:37:03,407 --> 01:37:05,534
Let me tell you what I believe.

1163
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:08,412
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1164
01:37:08,745 --> 01:37:13,041
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1165
01:37:13,292 --> 01:37:15,335
And since I am the ranking officer...

1166
01:37:15,586 --> 01:37:18,463
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1167
01:37:19,214 --> 01:37:21,633
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1168
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:23,594
Tank...

1169
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:24,887
...load us up.

1170
01:37:34,521 --> 01:37:37,816
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1171
01:37:38,233 --> 01:37:39,776
...during my time here.

1172
01:37:40,027 --> 01:37:44,031
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1173
01:37:44,281 --> 01:37:46,533
...and I realized...

1174
01:37:46,783 --> 01:37:49,077
...that you're not actually mammals.

1175
01:37:51,288 --> 01:37:53,749
Every mammal on this planet...

1176
01:37:54,082 --> 01:37:59,004
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1177
01:37:59,254 --> 01:38:01,089
But you humans do not.

1178
01:38:01,632 --> 01:38:05,177
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1179
01:38:05,427 --> 01:38:09,932
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1180
01:38:10,265 --> 01:38:12,351
The only way you can survive...

1181
01:38:12,643 --> 01:38:15,604
...is to spread to another area.

1182
01:38:21,026 --> 01:38:23,904
There is another organism
on this planet...

1183
01:38:24,154 --> 01:38:26,114
...that follows the same pattern.

1184
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:28,408
Do you know what it is?

1185
01:38:28,784 --> 01:38:30,619
A virus.

1186
01:38:31,954 --> 01:38:34,998
Human beings are a disease.

1187
01:38:35,374 --> 01:38:36,917
A cancer of this planet.

1188
01:38:37,167 --> 01:38:39,294
You are a plague.

1189
01:38:39,837 --> 01:38:41,255
And we...

1190
01:38:41,421 --> 01:38:42,798
...are the cure.

1191
01:38:43,799 --> 01:38:45,217
Okay, so what do you need?

1192
01:38:45,843 --> 01:38:46,969
Besides a miracle.

1193
01:38:47,553 --> 01:38:48,762
Guns.

1194
01:38:49,596 --> 01:38:50,806
Lots of guns.

1195
01:39:00,691 --> 01:39:01,900
Neo...

1196
01:39:03,652 --> 01:39:06,196
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1197
01:39:07,406 --> 01:39:09,324
That's why it's going to work.

1198
01:39:13,412 --> 01:39:15,330
Why isn't the serum working?

1199
01:39:15,956 --> 01:39:18,250
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1200
01:39:20,335 --> 01:39:21,587
Leave me with him.

1201
01:39:24,173 --> 01:39:25,299
Now.

SMITH:
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1205
01:39:45,819 --> 01:39:48,488
I'm going to be honest...

1206
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,073

...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1213
01:40:07,758 --> 01:40:10,052
I can't stand it any longer.

1214
01:40:10,802 --> 01:40:12,679
It's the smell.

1215
01:40:14,056 --> 01:40:15,933
If there is such a thing.

1216
01:40:16,266 --> 01:40:19,561
I feel saturated by it.

1217
01:40:21,063 --> 01:40:22,356
I can...

1218
01:40:22,606 --> 01:40:24,149
...taste...

1219
01:40:24,316 --> 01:40:26,360
...your stink.

1220
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:30,239
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1221
01:40:30,405 --> 01:40:31,406
It's repulsive.

1222
01:40:32,407 --> 01:40:33,784
Isn't it'?

1223
01:40:35,953 --> 01:40:38,247
I must get out of here.

1224
01:40:38,664 --> 01:40:40,874
I must get free.

1225
01:40:41,124 --> 01:40:44,002
And in this mind is the key.

1226

My key.

1227
01:40:46,171 --> 01:40:49,049
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1228
01:40:49,299 --> 01:40:50,926
Do you understand?

1229
01:40:51,218 --> 01:40:52,594
I need the codes.

1230
01:40:52,845 --> 01:40:55,180
I have to get inside Zion...

1231
01:40:55,514 --> 01:40:58,016
...and you have to tell me how.

1232
01:40:58,433 --> 01:41:00,310
You're going to tell me...

1233
01:41:00,561 --> 01:41:02,729
...or you're going to die.

1234
01:41:22,916 --> 01:41:26,044
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

What were you doing?

1239
01:44:28,644 --> 01:44:29,937
He doesn't know.

1240
01:44:30,187 --> 01:44:31,688
Know what?

1241
01:44:59,758 --> 01:45:02,261
I think they're trying to save him.

You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.
