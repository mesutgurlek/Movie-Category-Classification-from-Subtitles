That's not the same thing.

478
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,081
Same thing you tried to do.

479

BENJI: You're not going to
believe that, are you?

480
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,005

481

they were redundancies.

DIRECTOR HUNLEY:
<i>Less than 24 hours</i>

498
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,283
<i>after we interviewed Benji Dunn
about Ethan Hunt,</i>

499
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,764
He was on a plane to Vienna
with tickets to the opera.

500
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,764
And within six hours of his arrival,
the Chancellor was dead.

501
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,207
Now, that might be circumstance
to some public defender,

502
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,250
but to the CIA,
that is actionable intelligence.

503
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,322
Consider for the moment
the possibility that

504
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,841
Ethan's investigation
led him to the opera,

505
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,570
and that he's the one
with the actionable intelligence!

506
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,770
In any case, finding Hunt
is no longer a pet project.

507
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,447
The Special Activities Division
will now have full discretion.

508
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,681
You mean shoot to kill.

509
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,210
Whether Hunt lives or dies
is entirely up to him.

Once you're there,

515
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,888
- I'm sorry, what?
- Just tell the truth.

516
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,804
You came to Vienna believing
you won two tickets to the opera.

517
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,451
I attempted to recruit you
into assassinating the Chancellor.

518
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,000
- You refused.
- That's not the truth!

them believing you, Benji.

It'll go easier
if you tell them what they want to hear.

what this is all about.

He's former KSA. German intelligence.

Missing, presumed dead.

526
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,969

Tonight, I made it official.

531
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,927
I was looking for him in the Bosphorus.

532
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,482
The same day, a car accident
killed the visiting President of Malawi.

533
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,569
He slipped away again in Jakarta,

534
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,450
hours before a passenger plane
vanished over the Pacific

535
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,761
with 236 passengers.

536
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,889
I just missed him in the Philippines

537
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,167
right before a fire
at a petrochemical plant

538
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,208
gassed a village of 2,000 people.

539

You're saying these accidents
are somehow connected.

540
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,890
That missing plane was carrying
the Secretary of the World Bank.

541
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,611
That fire bankrupted
a global arms corporation.

542
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,282
That wreck triggered a civil war.

543
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,890
These are no accidents.

544
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,126
They're links in a chain.

The work of a single organization,

A rogue nation,

Destroy the system that created them
regardless of who's in their way.

they've been escalating unchecked.

551

the start of a new phase.

553

Not much. And not a lot of time.

ILSA: <i>His name Solomon Lane.</i>

643
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,960
He created the Syndicate.

644
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,761
Where does he come from?

645
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,884
He's former British intelligence.

646
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,681
Well, if British intelligence knows
the Syndicate exists,

647
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,842
why don't they just tell the CIA?

648
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,684
Because they don't want
anyone knowing

649
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,730
the Syndicate was created
by one of their own.

650
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,331
I was sent undercover
to earn Lane's trust

651
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,683
and eventually identify the members
of his organization.

652
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,924
And for the first time in two years,
I'm close to knowing who they are.

653
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,285
Lane had a ledger.

654
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,445
It contained the identities of
his operatives, his terrorist associates,

655
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,245
the entire inner workings
of the Syndicate.

656
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,369
One of his agents stole it,
hoping to blackmail him,

657
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,570
and kept it in a secure computer facility
for safekeeping.

658
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,371
He died being interrogated
for the access code,

659
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,169
leaving Lane with a serious problem.

660
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,886
So the key to crushing Lane

661
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,964
is sitting in a computer,
just waiting for someone to take it.

662
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,448
So, why hasn't Lane
just sent someone to steal it?

663
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,526
Oh, he has.

664
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,645
He sent me.

665
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,806
And I can tell you

666
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,811
it's impossible.

667
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,522
The facility's hidden beneath
a local power plant under military guard.

668
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,364
And the only way to download the ledger

669
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,324
is through the central
computer terminal, located there.

Where does the water come from?

Desalinized seawater flows through
the intake, in the power plant.

the IMF be dissolved.

DIRECTOR HUNLEY:
That is correct, sir.

How do you explain
your testimony today?

02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:35,241
It's quite simple, really.
We had reason to believe that

the Syndicate had infiltrated

In order for our man

his cover had to be absolute.

The whole operation was known

and a handful of IMF agents.
