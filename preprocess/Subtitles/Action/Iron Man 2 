1
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,927
<i> It's been a while since I was</i>

2
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:28,265
<i> ...up here in front of you maybe i'll stick to the cards</i>

3
00:00:30,934 --> 00:00:35,150
<i>There's been speculation that I was involved in the events
that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop.</i>

4
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,800
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that</i>

5
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:40,887
<i>that was  bodyguard
in a suit</i>

6
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:44,765
<i> that conveniently appeared,
despite the fact that you historically despise bodyguards?</i>

7
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:46,310
<i> Yes.</i>

8
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:48,939
<i>And this mysterious bodyguard was...</i>

9
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,838
<i>...somehow equipped with...</i>

10
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:54,398
<i>...an undisclosed Stark high-tech
powered battle suit?</i>

11
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,933
<i> I know that it's confusing.</i>

12
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,557
<i>It is one thing
to question the official story</i>

13
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,112
<i> and another thing entirely to make wild accusations
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

14
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:10,068
<i>I mean, let's face it I'm not,
the heroic type.</i>

15
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,453
<i> I've a laundry list of character defects,
all the mistakes that I've made...</i>

16
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:15,513
<i>largely public.</i>

17
00:01:15,562 --> 00:01:17,044
<i> The truth is...</i>

18
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:23,517
<i> ...I am Iron Man.</i>

19
00:01:28,316 --> 00:01:29,616
Ivan ...

20
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:35,524
Ivan?

21
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,514
That should be you.

22
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:07,193
Do not listen to these morons.

23
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,281
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:16,506
I can only offer you
my knowledge.

25
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:41,195
<i> Iron Man stabilizes East-West relations</i>

26
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:21,601
<i> 7-0 at 30 knots.
Holding steady at 15000 feet.</i>

27
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:24,561
<i>You are clear for exfiltration
over the drop zone.</i>

28
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:28,892
Six months later

29
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,117
It's good to be back!

30
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:28,996
You missed me.

31
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:31,892
- Blow something up!
- Blow something up?

32
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,458
I already did that.

33
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,677
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying...

34
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:40,166
...its longest period of
uninterrupted peace in years...

35
00:07:40,171 --> 00:07:41,768
because of me.

36
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:46,669
I'm not saying...

37
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,605
...that from the ashes of captivity...

38
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,158
...never has a greater Phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

39
00:07:58,358 --> 00:08:00,033
I'm not saying...

40
00:08:00,182 --> 00:08:04,295
...that Uncle Sam can kick back
on a lawn chair,...

41
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:06,320
...sipping on iced tea,...

42
00:08:06,382 --> 00:08:09,136
...because I haven't come across anyone
who's man enough...

43
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:12,119
...to go toe to toe with me
on my best day!

44
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:19,704
- I love you Tony!
- Please. It's not about me.

45
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:23,598
It's not about you.

46
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:28,396
It's not even about us.
It's about legacy.

47
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:32,243
It's about what we choose to leave behind
for future generations.

48
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:34,414
And that's why for the next year...

49
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:36,501
and for the first time since 1974,...

50
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:38,584
...the best and brightest men and women

51
00:08:38,588 --> 00:08:40,988
...of nations and corporations the world over...

52
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:44,466
will pool their resources
share their collective vision,

53
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:47,638
to leave behind
a brighter future.

54
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,407
It's not about us!

55
00:08:50,303 --> 00:08:53,488
Therefore, what I am saying,
if I'm saying anything,

56
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:56,395
...is welcome back to the Stark Expo!

57
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:03,606
Now, making a special guest appearance
from the great beyond,

58
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:05,025
to tell you what it's all about,

59
00:09:05,236 --> 00:09:08,112
please welcome my father, Howard.

60
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:12,829
<i>Everything is achievable through technology.</i>

61
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,645
<i> Better living.
Robust health.</i>

62
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:18,127
<i> And for the first time in human history,</i>

63
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:20,214
<i> the possibility of world peace.</i>

64
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:24,478
<i> So from all of us here at Stark Industries,
I would like to personally introduce you to</i>

65
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,791
<i> The city of the future.</i>

66
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:30,787
<i> technology holds infinite possibilities
for mankind.</i>

67
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:32,219
Blood toxicity 19%

68
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:37,649
<i> soon, technology will affect
the way you live your life every day.</i>

69
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,538
<i> No more tedious work,</i>

70
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:42,145
<i> leaving more time,
leisure activities</i>

71
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,106
<i> and enjoying sweet life.</i>

72
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,162
<i>The Stark Expo.
Welcome.</i>

73
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:54,356
We are coming to you live from the kick-off
of the Stark Expo

74
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:57,849
where Tony Stark
has just walked onstage.

75
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,908
Don't worry if you can't make it down here now,

76
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:01,995
because this expo goes on all year long.

77
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:04,177
And I'm gonna be here checking out
all the attractions

78
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:08,141
and the pavillions and the inventions
from all around the world.

79
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,996
It's a zoo out there, watch out alright.

80
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:11,800
Open up. Let's go.

81
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:14,169
Nice to see you, alright.

82
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:15,660
Thank you.
I remember you.

83
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:19,154
- Call me.
- Hey, come on ...

84
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:20,535
Hi there, dear friend.

85
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,759
It'll be a pleasure.

86
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:25,753
- See ya buddy.
- This is Larry.

87
00:10:25,754 --> 00:10:28,476
The oracle of goracle.
What a pleasure, nice to see you.

88
00:10:28,477 --> 00:10:29,931
Call me.

89
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:31,128
- Larry King.
- Larry!

90
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:34,170
Yes, my people, my people.

91
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:37,041
- Did it go pretty mellow?
- It wasn't so bad.

92
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:38,941
- No, it's perfect.

93
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:40,978
Look what we got here,
the new model.

94
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:42,813
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

95
00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:44,134
Hi. And you are?

96
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:46,192
- Marshall. - Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you Tony

97
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:48,120
I'm on the wheel, you mind?

98
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:49,737
- Where you from?
- Bedford.

99
00:10:49,738 --> 00:10:51,130
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

100
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:53,737
Yeah? You found me.

101
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,263
- What are you up to later?
- Serving subpoenas.

102
00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:00,167
Yikes.

103
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,066
- He doesn't like to be handed things.
- Yeah I have a peeve.

104
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:06,600
You are hereby ordered to appear before
the Senate Armed Services Committee

105
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,216
tomorrow morning at 9 am.

106
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:11,232
- Can I see a badge? - You wanna see the badge?
- He likes the badge.

107
00:11:12,358 --> 00:11:14,576
- You still like it?
- Yup.

108
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:18,794
- How far are we from D.C.?
- D.C.?

109
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,515
250 miles.

110
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,565
Mr. Stark, can we pick up now
where we left off?

111
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,077
Mr. Stark?

112
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,514
- Please.
- Yes, dear?

113
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:31,303
- Can I have your attention?
- Absolutely.

114
00:11:31,305 --> 00:11:34,574
Do you or do you not possess a specialized weapon?

115
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:36,442
- I do not.
- You do not?

116
00:11:36,443 --> 00:11:40,460
- I do not, well it depends how you define
the word weapon. - The Iron Man weapon.

117
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:42,569
My device does not fit
that description.

118
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:47,136
- Well, how would you describe your..?
- I would describe it by defining it as what it is, sir.

119
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,973
- As?
- It's a high-tech prosthesis.

120
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:54,732
That is, that's actually the most apt description
I could make of it.

121
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:59,879
- It's a weapon Mr Stark I hate to inform you it's a weapon.
- Please, if your priority was actually the well-being...

122
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,728
My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon
turned over to the people of the United States of America.

123
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,395
Well, you can forget it.

124
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:10,567
I am Iron Man.
The suit and I are one.

125
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:13,701
To turn over the Iron Man suit would be
to turn over myself, which is tantamount to

126
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:15,534
indentured servitude or prostitution

127
00:12:15,683 --> 00:12:17,703
depending on what state you're in.

128
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:21,024
- I can't have it.
- Look, I am no expert.

129
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:23,449
In prostitution? Of course not,
you're a senator, come on!

130
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:28,080
I'm not an expert in weapons.

131
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,976
But we have somebody here who is an expert
on weapons. I would now like to call Justin Hammer

132
00:12:31,987 --> 00:12:35,558
Our current primary weapons contractor.

133
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:39,520
Let the record reflect that I observe
Mr. Hammer entering the chamber

134
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:40,865
and I am wondering...

135
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:46,015
if and when any
actual expert will also be in attendance.

136
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:51,045
Absolutely. I am no expert.

137
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:53,056
I defer to you, Anthony.

138
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,903
You're the wonder boy.

139
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,750
Senator, if I may...

140
00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:01,476
I may well not be an expert,
but you know who was the expert?

141
00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:03,218
Your dad!

142
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:06,515
Howard Stark.
Really a father to us all.

143
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:09,227
and to the millitary-industrial age.

144
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:13,566
Let's just be clear, he was no flower child.
He was a lion.

145
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,213
We all know why we are here:

146
00:13:15,214 --> 00:13:17,083
In the last six months,

147
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:20,941
Anthony Stark has created
a sword with untold possibilities.

148
00:13:21,087 --> 00:13:23,812
And yet I insists it's a shield.

149
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,487
He asks us to trust him

150
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:28,468
as we cower behind it.

151
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:31,803
I wish I were comforted, Anthony.
I really do.

152
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:34,905
I'd like to leave my door unlocked
when I leave the house,

153
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,574
but this ain't Canada.

154
00:13:36,612 --> 00:13:38,243
You know we live in a world
of grave threats,

155
00:13:38,282 --> 00:13:42,415
threats that Mr. Stark
will not always be able to foresee.

156
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:46,981
Thank you. God bless
Iron Man, God bless America.

157
00:13:48,946 --> 00:13:50,911
Well said, Mr. Hammer.

158
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,634
The committee would now like to invite

159
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:56,106
Lieut. Col. James Rhodes to the chamber.

160
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:57,505
Rhodey?

161
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:07,145
Hey, buddy. Didn't expect
to see you here.

162
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:10,877
Look, it's me. I'm here. Deal with it.
Let's move on.

163
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,427
- I just ...
- Drop it. - Alright, I'll drop it.

164
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:16,030
I have before me a complete report on
the Iron Man weapon

165
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:17,698
compiled by Colonel Rhodes.

166
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:22,404
and Colonel, for the record,
can you please read page 57, paragraph 4?

167
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:25,249
You're requesting that I read specific selections
from my report, senator?

168
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:25,915
Yes, sir.

169
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:30,328
My understanding that I was going to be
testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.

170
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,147
I understand, a lot of things have changed today.

171
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:35,970
You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of
context does not reflect the summary of my finding?

172
00:14:35,971 --> 00:14:38,751
Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

173
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:41,530
Very well.

174
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:46,920
As he does not operate within any
definable branch of government,

175
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:52,772
The Iron Man presents a potential threat
to the security of both the nation

176
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:54,376
and to her interests.

177
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:59,392
I did, however, go on to summarize that the benefits
of Iron Man far outweigh the liabilities

178
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,090
and that it would be in our interest

179
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:04,220
to fold Mr Stark into the existing
chain of command.

180
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:07,799
I'm not a joiner but I'll consider Secretary of
Defense, if you ask nice.

181
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:09,878
We can amend the hours a little bit.

182
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:15,249
I'd like to go on and show, if I may,
the imagery that's connected to your report.

183
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,057
I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal
these images to the general public at this time.

184
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:23,279
With all due respect, Colonel, I understand.
And if you could just narrate those for us,

185
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,156
we'd be very grateful.

186
00:15:25,852 --> 00:15:27,084
Show the images.

187
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:32,181
Intelligence suggests that the
devices seen in these photos

188
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,756
are in fact attempts at making manned copies

189
00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:36,895
of Mr. Stark's suit.

190
00:15:36,896 --> 00:15:39,971
This has been corroborated by our allies

191
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:41,713
and local intelligence on the ground

192
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:44,139
indicating that these suits are

193
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:47,163
quite possibly at this moment operational.

194
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:49,290
Hold on a second buddy, let me see.

195
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:52,574
There's something here.
Oh, boy I'm good.

196
00:15:52,587 --> 00:15:54,555
Now can I get more screens.

197
00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:58,478
I need them.
Time for a little transparency.

198
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:00,372
- Let's see what's really going on.
- What is he doing?

199
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:02,972
If you'll direct your attention to said screens,

200
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,580
I believe that's North Korea.

201
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:16,422
Can you turn that off? Take it off.

202
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:18,448
Iran.

203
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:23,821
No grave, immediate threat here.

204
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:25,804
Is that Justin Hammer?

205
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:28,491
How did Hammer get in here?

206
00:16:28,492 --> 00:16:30,462
Justin, you're on TV, focus up.

207
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,166
Wow. Yeah, I'd say most countries, 5-10 years away.

208
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:50,266
- Hammer Industries 20.
- I'd like to point out that that test pilot survived.

209
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:53,518
I think we got the point that he's making.
I don't think there's any reason...

210
00:16:53,605 --> 00:16:55,186
The point is you're welcome, I guess.

211
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:57,785
- For what?
- Because, I'm your nuclear deterrent.

212
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:00,364
It's working. We're safe.
America is secure.

213
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,555
You want my property?
You can't have it!

214
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:04,743
But did I you a big favor.

215
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:07,424
I've successfully privatized world peace.

216
00:17:10,535 --> 00:17:11,974
What more do you want?

217
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:13,743
For now!

218
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:17,190
I'm tired of all of these ass clowns!

219
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,194
Fuck you Mr Stark.
Fuck you buddy.

220
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:23,046
- We're adjourned, we're adjourned for today.
- Okay

221
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:25,124
You've been a delight.

222
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:32,687
<i> My bond is with the people.</i>

223
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:34,937
<i> And I will serve this great nation</i>

224
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:38,650
<i> at the pleasure of myself.</i>

225
00:17:38,962 --> 00:17:41,974
<i> One thing I've proven
is that you can count on me ...</i>

226
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:43,581
<i> ...to pleasure myself.</i>

227
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:22,173
- Wake up, daddy's home.
- Welcome home, sir.

228
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,931
Congratulations on the opening ceremonies.
They were such a success.

229
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:27,038
as was your Senate hearing.

230
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:32,128
And may I say how refreshing it is to finally
see you in a video with your clothing on, sir?

231
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,483
You!

232
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,556
I swear to god I'll dismantle you, I'll switch
your motherboard and turn you into wine rack.

233
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:45,494
How many ounces a day of this gargle
am I supposed to drink?

234
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:49,188
We are up to 80 ounces a day
to counteract the symptoms, sir.

235
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:52,420
Check palladium levels.

236
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:57,175
Blood toxicity: 24%

237
00:18:58,264 --> 00:19:02,599
It appears that the continued use of the
Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition.

238
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,788
Another core has been depleted.

239
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,053
God, they're running out quick.

240
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,775
I have run simulations
on every known element

241
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:18,386
and none can serve as a viable replacement for
the palladium core.

242
00:19:21,336 --> 00:19:23,584
You are running out of both time
and options.

243
00:19:28,178 --> 00:19:32,079
Unfortunately, the device
that's keeping you alive, is also killing you.

244
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:37,042
Ms. Potts is approaching.
I recommended that you inform her of...

245
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,324
Mute.

246
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:43,039
Is this a joke?

247
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:45,891
What are you thinking?

248
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:47,536
- What?
- What are you thinking?

249
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,738
Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy
and you're angry about something.

250
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:52,642
Do you have the sniffles? I don't wanna get sick.
Keep your distance

251
00:19:52,643 --> 00:19:57,322
Did you just donate our entire
modern art collection to the...

252
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:59,688
- Boy Scouts of America?
- Yes it is a...

253
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:01,463
worthwhile organization.

254
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:04,825
I didn't physically check the crates,
but basically yes.

255
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:07,061
And it's not our collection, it's my collection. No offense.

256
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,806
No, you know what I think I'm actually entitled to say
Our collection,

257
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:15,012
considering the time that I've put in
over 10 years curating that.

258
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,256
It's a tax write-off, I needed that.

259
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,525
You know, there's only about 8,011 things

260
00:20:18,553 --> 00:20:21,341
that I really need to talk to you about.

261
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:24,391
Dummy, hey stop now the bridgeport's already
machining that part.

262
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:26,724
The expo is a gigantic waste of time.

263
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:30,434
- I need you to wear a surgical mask until
you're feeling better is that okay? - That's rude.

264
00:20:30,435 --> 00:20:32,071
There's nothing more important to me than the Expo.

265
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:33,552
It's my primary point of concern. I don't know why you...

266
00:20:33,553 --> 00:20:36,875
The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

267
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:38,558
Wow, look at that.

268
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:42,522
That's modern art.
That's going up.

269
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,343
- You've got to be kidding me.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.

270
00:20:44,908 --> 00:20:47,670
Stark is in complete disarray. Do you understand that?

271
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:49,828
No, our stocks have never been higher...

272
00:20:49,829 --> 00:20:54,168
- Yes from a managerial standpoint. - Well if it's messy,
then let's double back. Let's move on to another subject.

273
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:58,040
Oh, no no no, you are not taking down the
Barnett Newman and hanging that up!

274
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,645
I'm not taking it down, I'm just replacing it
with this, let's see where I can get...

275
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:02,271
Ok fine. My point is

276
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:05,860
We have already awarded contracts
to the windfarm people,

277
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:07,669
Don't say windfarm, I'm already feeling gassy.

278
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,590
And to the Plastic Plantation Tree,
which was your idea by the way.

279
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:12,511
- Those people are on payroll, and you won't
make a decision. - Everything was my idea,

280
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:14,361
I don't care about the liberal agenda anymore.

281
00:21:14,362 --> 00:21:16,747
It's boring, boring!
I'm giving you a boring order,

282
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:17,920
you do it.

283
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:19,276
I do what?

284
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:21,776
Excellent idea, I just figured this out.
You run the company.

285
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:24,251
- Yeah, i'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

286
00:21:24,273 --> 00:21:28,320
- Well stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not give me the information that I need

287
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,706
- I need you to do it.
- I am trying to do it but...

288
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:33,665
You're not listening to me. I'm trying to make you CEO.

289
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:35,542
Why won't you let me?

290
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,783
Have you been drinking?

291
00:21:38,434 --> 00:21:39,798
Uh, chlorophyl.

292
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,046
I hereby irrevocably appoint you

293
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,757
Chairman and CEO
of Stark Industries effective immediately.

294
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:51,033
Yeah, done deal.

295
00:21:53,115 --> 00:21:55,640
Actually, I've given this a fair amount of thought.

296
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:58,730
believe it or not. Been doing a bit of
a headhunting so to speak...

297
00:21:59,804 --> 00:22:02,930
trying to figure out who
a worthy successor would be.

298
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:05,275
And then I realized ...

299
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:10,791
it's you.
It's always been you.

300
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,286
I thought there'd be a legal issue,
but actually

301
00:22:14,338 --> 00:22:16,998
I'm capable of appointing my successor,

302
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:19,661
my successor being you.

303
00:22:22,252 --> 00:22:23,740
Congratulations!

304
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:26,365
Take it, just take it.

305
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:28,404
- I don't know what to think.
- Don't think, drink.

306
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:19,759
Notary is here! Can you please come
sign the transfer paperworks?

307
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,061
I'm on Happy's count!

308
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,968
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

309
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:30,970
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

310
00:23:31,054 --> 00:23:33,683
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

311
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,156
I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.

312
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:47,079
I need you to initial each box.

313
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:50,192
Lesson one:
Never take your eye off...

314
00:23:52,989 --> 00:23:54,143
That's it I'm done.

315
00:23:54,144 --> 00:23:56,371
- What's your name, lady?
- Rushman, Natalie Rushman.

316
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:58,098
Front and center, come in to the church.

317
00:23:58,099 --> 00:24:01,995
- No, you're seriously not gonna...
- If it pleases the Court, which it does.

318
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:05,289
- No problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

319
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,191
What?

320
00:24:24,185 --> 00:24:26,218
- Can you give her a lesson?
- No problem.

321
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,304
What?

322
00:24:30,104 --> 00:24:31,280
Who is she?

323
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:33,927
She is from legal and she is potentially

324
00:24:33,928 --> 00:24:37,390
a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit

325
00:24:37,391 --> 00:24:39,650
- if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need an assistant boxer. I need an assistant.

326
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:43,274
Yes, and I have three excellent potential candidates
that are lined up and ready to beat you.

327
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:47,526
- I don't have time to meet. I need someone now
I feel like it's her. - No it's not.

328
00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:49,329
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

329
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,580
Like Tae Bo, booty boot camp, crunch,
something like that?

330
00:24:53,495 --> 00:24:57,149
- How do we spell your name Natalie?
- R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

331
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,450
- What are you gonna google her now?
- I thought I was ogling her.

332
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:05,586
- Oh wow. Very, very impressive individual...
- You're so predictable, you know that?

333
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,432
she's fluent in French,
Italian, Russian, Latin...

334
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,683
Who speaks Latin?

335
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:11,095
No one speaks Latin. It's a dead language.

336
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,600
You can read Latin or you can write, but you can't
speak Latin so...

337
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:17,823
- Did you model in Tokyo?
Cause she modelled in Tokyo. - No.

338
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:19,273
I need her, she's got everything that I need.

339
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:21,606
Rule number one: Never take your eye off
your opponent.

340
00:25:23,862 --> 00:25:25,620
Oh my God!

341
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,259
- Happy!
- That's what I'm talking about.

342
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:32,439
- I slipped.
- You did?

343
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,212
Looks like a TKO to me.

344
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:41,545
- Just, um, I need your impression.
- You have quite reserved, I don't know...

345
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:44,186
- I meant your fingerprints.
- Right.

346
00:25:46,937 --> 00:25:50,145
- So, how're we doing?
- Great. Just half done,... hey.

347
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:52,966
You're the boss.

348
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:54,721
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

349
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:55,687
- No.
- Yes.

350
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:58,119
That will be all, Ms. Rushman.
Thank you very much.

351
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,251
- I want one.
- No.

352
00:26:14,162 --> 00:26:16,811
Welcome to the Historic Grand Prix
of Monaco.

353
00:26:16,873 --> 00:26:19,940
This year's race will be exciting...

354
00:26:37,615 --> 00:26:41,420
It's Europe, whatever happens the next
twenty minutes just go with it.

355
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:43,129
- Mr. Stark?
- Hey

356
00:26:43,194 --> 00:26:45,007
- How was your flight?
- It was excellent.

357
00:26:45,111 --> 00:26:48,421
- Oh it's nice to see you.
- We have one photographer from the ACM if you don't mind.

358
00:26:49,928 --> 00:26:52,082
- When did this happen?
- You made me do it.

359
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:54,536
- I made you do what?
- Smile and you. Look there.

360
00:26:54,944 --> 00:26:56,079
Stop acting constipated.

361
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,712
- You are so predictable.
- Do not inflate your nostrils.

362
00:26:57,713 --> 00:26:59,609
- Right this way.
- Thanks, you look fantastic.

363
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,276
- Why thank you very much.
- But that's unprofessional. What's on the docket?

364
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:04,265
We have a 9.30 dinner.

365
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:07,869
- Perfect I'll be there at 11. Is this ours?
- It can be.

366
00:27:08,184 --> 00:27:09,504
Great, make it ours.

367
00:27:10,017 --> 00:27:12,563
Mr. Musk, how are you?

368
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,462
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

369
00:27:14,463 --> 00:27:16,720
Elon, those Merlin engines
are fantastic.

370
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:18,723
Thanks. I got an idea
for an electric jet.

371
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:21,032
You do? Then we'll make it work.

372
00:27:22,401 --> 00:27:25,091
- You want a massage? - Oh god no I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an appointment.

373
00:27:25,092 --> 00:27:27,135
I do not want Natalie to do anything.

374
00:27:27,136 --> 00:27:29,243
- By the way I didn't mean to spring this on you.
- Thank you very much.

375
00:27:29,326 --> 00:27:31,122
Green is not your best color.

376
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:32,984
Anthony, is that you?

377
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,501
My least favorite person on earth,
Justin Hammer. - How you doing?

378
00:27:35,797 --> 00:27:38,649
You're not the only rich guy here
with a fancy car.

379
00:27:38,862 --> 00:27:41,729
You know Christine Everhart
from Vanity Fair? You guys know each other?

380
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,108
- Hi.
- Yes.

381
00:27:43,297 --> 00:27:44,918
- Yes!
- Yes, roughly.

382
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:47,100
BTW, big story,

383
00:27:47,175 --> 00:27:49,499
The new CEO of Stark Industries.

384
00:27:49,871 --> 00:27:51,899
- Congratulations.
- My editor will kill me ...

385
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,726
... if I don't grab a quote
for our Powerful Women issue.
- Oh.

386
00:27:53,778 --> 00:27:55,291
- Can I?
- Sure.

387
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,442
She's actually doing a big spread on me
for Vanity Fair.

388
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,738
- I am.
- I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

389
00:28:01,227 --> 00:28:04,589
She did quite a spread on
Tony last year.

390
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,472
- And she wrote a story as well.
- It was very impressive.

391
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:09,183
- That was good.
- Very well done.

392
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,418
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Do not leave me.

393
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:15,425
- How you doing? You look great.
- Please, this is hard.

394
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:20,421
- So is this the first time that...
- Oh, god that's so awful.

395
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:23,840
Listen, it's the first time you've seen each other
since the Senate?

396
00:28:23,841 --> 00:28:27,659
- Since he got his contract revoked.
- Actually, it's on hold.

397
00:28:27,701 --> 00:28:28,911
That's not what I heard.

398
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:31,717
What's the difference between
on hold and canceled? The truth?

399
00:28:31,718 --> 00:28:34,159
No. The truth is, oh put that away,

400
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,539
The truth is I'm actually hoping to
present something at your expo.

401
00:28:38,994 --> 00:28:41,829
Well, if you invent something that works,
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

402
00:28:41,915 --> 00:28:43,759
- Mr. Stark?
- Yes.

403
00:28:43,885 --> 00:28:45,388
- He's kidding,...
- Your corner table is ready.

404
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:48,084
- I actually have a slot, yes I do.
- Hammer needs a 'slot.'

405
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:52,337
- We'll give him. - We kid, we're kidders.

406
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,917
Got any other bad ideas?

407
00:29:25,926 --> 00:29:28,153
Tony and I, Tony,
I love Tony Stark.

408
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,125
Tony loves me.
We're not competitors.

409
00:29:30,126 --> 00:29:33,884
Him being out of the picture created tremendous
opportunity for Hammer Industries you know.

410
00:29:35,216 --> 00:29:37,780
Everything that Tony and I do is a healthy...

411
00:29:37,795 --> 00:29:40,597
<i>What's the use of having and owning
a race car,</i>

412
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:42,890
...competition.

413
00:29:42,946 --> 00:29:44,262
<i> ...if you don't drive it?</i>

414
00:29:45,935 --> 00:29:47,441
Is he driving?

415
00:29:54,414 --> 00:29:56,037
Natalie! Natalie!

416
00:29:56,988 --> 00:29:58,295
- Yes?
- Did you know about this?

417
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,085
This is the first time I hear it.

418
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:03,879
- That cannot happen.
- Absolutely, I understand. How can I help you?

419
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,624
- Where is Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

420
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,099
- Ok get him, I need Happy.
- Right away.

421
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,001
Tony is, we're, you know...

422
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,609
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

423
00:30:12,974 --> 00:30:14,308
You know what?
Can you excuse me just one second?

424
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,498
- Why don't you just read me what you wrote?
- I will.

425
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:19,812
- After I make one quick phone call.
- Where are you going?

426
00:30:19,813 --> 00:30:22,438
- I got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff, I'll be right back!

427
00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:40,495
<i> That asshole just goes inside the track!</i>

428
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:15,958
<i> God!</i>

429
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,303
Go, go!

430
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,931
Hang on!

431
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:39,671
- Give me the case.
- Here, take it.

432
00:33:40,336 --> 00:33:41,469
- Where is the key!
- It's in my pocket.

433
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,911
Car!

434
00:34:54,406 --> 00:34:56,987
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

435
00:34:57,752 --> 00:35:00,029
- Were you heading for me or him?
- I wanted to scare him.

436
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,117
- Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?

437
00:35:02,118 --> 00:35:03,625
- Better security.
- Get in the car!

438
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:05,440
- I was attacked!
- You're a jerk!

439
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:06,605
- We need better security.
- Get in the car!

440
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:09,945
Better security measures!
God it's embarrassing.

441
00:35:10,966 --> 00:35:12,741
First vacation in two years.

442
00:35:17,821 --> 00:35:19,111
Oh  my god!

443
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,032
- I got him!
- Hit him again, hit him again!

444
00:35:23,185 --> 00:35:24,989
Give me the case.

445
00:35:26,944 --> 00:35:30,465
- I hit him!
- Give me the case!

446
00:35:31,104 --> 00:35:34,158
Give him the case!

447
00:35:39,682 --> 00:35:40,845
Oh, god!

448
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:45,850
Give me the case! Please!
Come on!

449
00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:19,520
You'll lose!

450
00:37:25,783 --> 00:37:29,058
You'll lose. You'll lose, Stark.

451
00:37:46,962 --> 00:37:51,298
We've checked his fingerprints. Nothing.
Not even a name.

452
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:53,730
- Where are we going?
- There.

453
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:56,125
He may not understand us.

454
00:37:56,137 --> 00:37:59,410
In fact, he has not even spoken.

455
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,737
Five minutes.

456
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:25,663
Pretty decent tech. Cycles
per second were a little low.

457
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:33,247
You could double up your rotations,

458
00:38:37,165 --> 00:38:39,931
You focused the Repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

459
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:41,808
Effective.

460
00:38:42,037 --> 00:38:45,530
Not very efficient.
But it's passable enough though.

461
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:50,691
I don't get it. With a little fine tuning
you could've made a solid paycheck,

462
00:38:50,692 --> 00:38:52,752
if you sold it to North Korea,
China,

463
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:56,333
Iran, or gone right to
the black market.

464
00:38:57,278 --> 00:38:59,174
You look like you got friends in low places.

465
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:02,265
You come from a

466
00:39:02,642 --> 00:39:05,918
family of thieves and butchers.

467
00:39:07,232 --> 00:39:09,649
And now,
like all guilty men,

468
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,972
try to rewrite your
own history

469
00:39:13,802 --> 00:39:16,468
and you forget all the lives

470
00:39:16,514 --> 00:39:18,763
that Stark family has destroyed.

471
00:39:19,853 --> 00:39:22,169
Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?

472
00:39:23,281 --> 00:39:26,567
My father.
Anton Vanko.

473
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,820
Well I've never heard of him.

474
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:33,326
My father is the reason you're alive.

475
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:36,639
The reason I'm alive is cause you had a shot,
you took it and you missed.

476
00:39:37,429 --> 00:39:38,667
Did I?

477
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:43,706
If you can make god bleed

478
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,799
people will cease to believe him.

479
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:51,391
And there will be blood in the water.

480
00:39:51,392 --> 00:39:53,299
and the sharks will come.

481
00:39:55,098 --> 00:39:58,589
The truth, all they have to do is sit and watch

482
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:01,934
as the world will consume you.

483
00:40:02,283 --> 00:40:04,422
Where will you be watching the world
consume me from?

484
00:40:04,473 --> 00:40:05,777
That's right.

485
00:40:05,828 --> 00:40:07,937
A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

486
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,639
Hey Tony, before you go,

487
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,431
palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

488
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,095
<i> It's just unbelievable it proves
the genie is out of the bottle</i>

489
00:40:35,096 --> 00:40:37,534
<i> and this man
has no idea what he's doing</i>

490
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:41,442
<i> He thinks of the Iron Man
weapon as a toy.</i>

491
00:40:41,615 --> 00:40:46,290
<i> I was at a hearing where
Mr. Stark in fact was adamant</i>

492
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:49,909
<i> that these suits can't exist,</i>

493
00:40:49,986 --> 00:40:52,516
<i> anywhere else, don't exist anywhere else,
never will exist anywhere else</i>

494
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:55,891
<i> at least for 5-10 years
and here we are in Monaco</i>

495
00:40:55,892 --> 00:40:58,707
<i> realizing, uh-oh, these suits exist now</i>

496
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:01,835
Mute.

497
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:03,922
He should be giving me a medal.

498
00:41:03,923 --> 00:41:06,163
That's the truth.

499
00:41:09,138 --> 00:41:11,223
What is that?

500
00:41:11,225 --> 00:41:14,508
This is your in-flight meal.

501
00:41:15,918 --> 00:41:18,525
- Did you just make that?
- Yeah.

502
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:21,809
Where do you think I've been for three hours?

503
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:24,939
Tony ...

504
00:41:26,244 --> 00:41:29,527
What are you not telling me?

505
00:41:32,503 --> 00:41:35,630
I don't want to go home ...

506
00:41:35,632 --> 00:41:37,717
at all.

507
00:41:37,718 --> 00:41:40,846
Let's cancel
my birthday party and

508
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:43,245
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Chipriani.

509
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,436
- Remember?
- Oh yes.

510
00:41:45,437 --> 00:41:48,043
It's a great place to...

511
00:41:48,044 --> 00:41:49,086
be healthy.

512
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:52,216
I don't think this is the right time.

513
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:54,302
We are in a kind of a mess.

514
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,543
Yeah but maybe that's why it's the best time.

515
00:41:56,832 --> 00:41:58,874
Wow, I think as the CEO I need to

516
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:02,168
show up. - As CEO
you are entitled to a

517
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:05,168
- leave?
- Company retreat.

518
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:07,218
A retreat? During a time like this?

519
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:10,512
I'm just saying to recharge our batteries
and figure it all out.

520
00:42:10,973 --> 00:42:14,685
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

521
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:49,792
<i>Have fun with the Püree</i>

522
00:43:41,004 --> 00:43:43,631
Prisoner stop!

523
00:43:43,632 --> 00:43:46,172
What are you doing?

524
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,208
Hey, here he is!

525
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:32,252
There he is!

526
00:44:32,566 --> 00:44:34,602
What an absolute pleasure.

527
00:44:34,604 --> 00:44:36,567
Welcome.

528
00:44:36,568 --> 00:44:41,255
Goodness gracious, can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

529
00:44:41,353 --> 00:44:43,353
Forgive me, I'm sorry.

530
00:44:43,355 --> 00:44:45,346
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

531
00:44:45,347 --> 00:44:47,312
I didn't wanna...

532
00:44:47,313 --> 00:44:48,932
make a first impression like this.

533
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:51,480
He's not an animal. Come on.

534
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,622
He's a human being.

535
00:44:53,623 --> 00:44:56,395
Thank you.

536
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,002
Leave us.

537
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:02,276
Oui, oui, I'm fine.

538
00:45:02,903 --> 00:45:04,938
My name is Justin Hammer.

539
00:45:04,939 --> 00:45:06,940
I'd like to do some business with you.

540
00:45:06,941 --> 00:45:09,028
Please sit.

541
00:45:11,907 --> 00:45:14,908
Dig in.
What do we have today, Jack?

542
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:16,259
Some salmon carpaccio, sir.

543
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,033
Salmon carpaccio?

544
00:45:19,268 --> 00:45:21,477
Anything you want here, we got it.

545
00:45:21,478 --> 00:45:23,478
I like my dessert first.

546
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:25,412
I had this flown in from
San Francisco.

547
00:45:25,413 --> 00:45:27,395
It's Italian though.

548
00:45:27,396 --> 00:45:29,307
Organic ice cream.

549
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:32,308
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do too

550
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:34,647
for Tony Stark.

551
00:45:34,727 --> 00:45:37,328
When I saw what you do to
Tony Stark on that track

552
00:45:37,329 --> 00:45:41,269
how you stepped up to him in front of
god and everybody,

553
00:45:41,478 --> 00:45:43,479
that was wow!

554
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,515
You spoke to me was what you did.

555
00:45:45,517 --> 00:45:47,480
And I know that you knew that
I'd be listening.

556
00:45:48,003 --> 00:45:51,004
This is why I couldn't bear to have you shipped off
to god knows where.

557
00:45:51,005 --> 00:45:53,005
It would've been such a waste of talent.

558
00:45:53,006 --> 00:45:55,006
But if I might make a suggestion you know
you don't just go

559
00:45:55,007 --> 00:45:58,007
and try to kill the guy. I think...

560
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:00,052
if I may,

561
00:46:00,054 --> 00:46:02,089
you go after his legacy.

562
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:04,054
That's what you should kill.

563
00:46:04,055 --> 00:46:07,099
You and me we're a lot alike in a lot of ways.

564
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,057
The only difference between you and I

565
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,508
is that I have resources.

566
00:46:12,509 --> 00:46:15,060
I think, if I may,

567
00:46:15,061 --> 00:46:17,075
you need my resources.

568
00:46:17,076 --> 00:46:19,019
Someone behind you.

569
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:22,141
A benefactor.
I'd like to be that guy.

570
00:46:33,506 --> 00:46:35,506
Okay.
Do you speak English,

571
00:46:35,507 --> 00:46:38,506
because I can get a translator.

572
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:40,957
I don't know if you've been understanding
everything I'm saying.

573
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:43,553
- Very good, man.
- Very good, man.

574
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:46,676
Very good, man.

575
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,723
- Yes.
- I want my bird.

576
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:55,559
A bird?

577
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,596
- You want a bird?
- I want my bird.

578
00:46:57,597 --> 00:46:59,597
I can get you bird
I can get you ten birds.

579
00:46:59,598 --> 00:47:01,555
- I want my bird.
- Okay,

580
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:03,519
nothing's impossible.

581
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,165
I could, are we talking about...
is this a bird back in Russia?

582
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,644
Yes, but the fundamentals of the company
are still very, very strong.

583
00:47:11,481 --> 00:47:14,482
despite the events in Monaco.

584
00:47:14,483 --> 00:47:16,526
Oh, oh, fax them.

585
00:47:16,527 --> 00:47:18,564
- Where is he?
- He doesn't wanna be disturbed.

586
00:47:18,565 --> 00:47:21,529
He's downstairs.

587
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,530
<i>His continuing erratic behavior</i>

588
00:47:23,531 --> 00:47:25,887
<i>may lead many people to ask themselves</i>

589
00:47:25,888 --> 00:47:27,915
<i>can this man still protect us?</i>

590
00:47:27,994 --> 00:47:29,614
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.

591
00:47:29,615 --> 00:47:32,535
The events in Monaco prove that.

592
00:47:32,536 --> 00:47:34,535
<i>Query complete, sir.</i>

593
00:47:34,536 --> 00:47:37,008
<i>Anton Vanko was
a Soviet physicist</i>

594
00:47:37,009 --> 00:47:40,268
<i>who defected to the United States
in 1963.</i>

595
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:42,540
<i> However, he was accused of espionage
and was</i>

596
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:44,541
<i>deported in 1967.</i>

597
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:46,542
<i>His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,</i>

598
00:47:46,543 --> 00:47:50,544
<i>was convicted of selling
Soviet-era weapons-grade plutonium</i>

599
00:47:50,545 --> 00:47:54,502
<i>to Pakistan and served 15 years
in Kopeisk prison.</i>

600
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:57,669
<i>No further records exist.</i>

601
00:48:00,506 --> 00:48:04,508
Tony, you gotta get upstair
and get on top of this situation right now.

602
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:08,422
Listen, I've been on the phone with the
National Guard

603
00:48:08,423 --> 00:48:10,154
all day

604
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:12,874
trying to talk them out of rolling tanks and the PCH

605
00:48:12,875 --> 00:48:15,382
knocking down your front door
and taking these.

606
00:48:15,383 --> 00:48:17,420
They're gonna take your suits, Tony,

607
00:48:17,421 --> 00:48:19,385
they're sick of the games.

608
00:48:19,386 --> 00:48:22,385
You said nobody else would possess this technology
for twenty years.

609
00:48:22,386 --> 00:48:25,344
Well guess what,
somebody else had it yesterday.

610
00:48:25,658 --> 00:48:28,554
It's not theoretical anymore.

611
00:48:29,391 --> 00:48:32,513
Are you listening to me?

612
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:36,350
Are you okay?

613
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,517
Let's go.

614
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:47,520
- Are you alright?
- Yeah I should go to my desk.

615
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,599
- See that cigar box?
- Yes.

616
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,810
It's palladium.

617
00:48:58,649 --> 00:49:00,649
Is that supposed to be smoking?

618
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:02,687
If you must know
it's neutron damage.

619
00:49:02,688 --> 00:49:05,774
it's from that reactor wall.

620
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,820
You had this
in your body?

621
00:49:15,616 --> 00:49:18,781
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

622
00:49:19,618 --> 00:49:22,784
Rogue rash.

623
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:26,744
Thank you.

624
00:49:37,715 --> 00:49:39,837
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.

625
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:43,675
You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act

626
00:49:43,676 --> 00:49:46,677
and it's unnecessary.
You don't have to do this alone.

627
00:49:46,678 --> 00:49:48,693
You know I wish I could believe that.
I really do.

628
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,635
But you gotta trust me.

629
00:49:50,637 --> 00:49:53,802
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

630
00:50:03,227 --> 00:50:05,680
This is where we do it
This is my humble abode.

631
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:07,645
You can work in absolute peace.

632
00:50:07,646 --> 00:50:10,769
Must be kinda fun to be dead, right
No pressure.

633
00:50:11,005 --> 00:50:13,649
Ah, here they are.
They're excited, they're combat ready.

634
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:15,687
I may have done a few miscalculations and

635
00:50:15,688 --> 00:50:17,652
rushed the prototype, but sue me,

636
00:50:17,653 --> 00:50:20,818
I'm enthusiastic.
Go ahead, take a look around.

637
00:50:26,658 --> 00:50:28,658
Oh, you don't wanna do that.

638
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:31,660
You'll be able to access that as soon as
we generate some encrypted passcodes.

639
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:35,035
Can we generate some encrypted passcodes?
Let's get some of those...

640
00:50:35,662 --> 00:50:37,644
encrypted passcodes, Jack.

641
00:50:38,665 --> 00:50:41,787
Nevermind.

642
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:45,790
Wow, okay. Good stuff.

643
00:50:46,981 --> 00:50:49,835
- Sorry?
- Software shit.

644
00:50:54,675 --> 00:50:56,674
You're good.

645
00:50:56,675 --> 00:50:59,799
You really blasted and
passed the firewall there.

646
00:51:00,635 --> 00:51:03,678
Let me show you where
you're gonna be working primarily.

647
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:06,681
Go ahead, take a look.

648
00:51:06,682 --> 00:51:08,891
Take a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

649
00:51:08,892 --> 00:51:11,849
You know they're really just for show and tell.

650
00:51:12,642 --> 00:51:15,851
They're 125.7 million a pop.

651
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:21,690
Jeez, could you get somebody to help?

652
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:24,648
That's where the pilot goes.

653
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:27,815
I'm having a tough time finding volunteers.

654
00:51:28,651 --> 00:51:31,817
I'll take care of that just leave it.

655
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:33,653
What you want them do?

656
00:51:33,654 --> 00:51:35,654
Long term
I want them to put me in

657
00:51:35,655 --> 00:51:38,656
the Pentagon for the
next 25 years.

658
00:51:38,657 --> 00:51:40,738
I wanna make Iron Man look
like an antique.

659
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:42,659
I wanna go to that Stark Expo

660
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,717
and take a dump on Tony's front yard.

661
00:51:44,718 --> 00:51:47,263
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Ya I can do that.

662
00:51:47,264 --> 00:51:48,761
- Yes?
- No problem.

663
00:51:48,762 --> 00:51:50,707
Hey, fabulous
I love it.

664
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:53,830
This is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.

665
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:05,715
Do you know which watch you'd like
to wear tonight Mr. Stark?

666
00:52:05,716 --> 00:52:08,840
I'll give them a look.

667
00:52:10,676 --> 00:52:12,713
I should cancel the party now?

668
00:52:12,714 --> 00:52:15,679
- Probably.
- Yeah, cause it's, um...

669
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,680
- Ill-timed.
- Right, sends the wrong message.

670
00:52:18,681 --> 00:52:21,804
Inappropriate.

671
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,686
Is that dirty enough for you?

672
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,731
Gold faced with the brown band...

673
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:33,689
The Jaeger.
I'll give that a look.

674
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:36,856
Bring them over here.

675
00:52:37,692 --> 00:52:40,858
I'll take that.
Why don't you...

676
00:52:52,326 --> 00:52:54,701
I gotta say it's hard to
get a read on you.

677
00:52:54,702 --> 00:52:57,825
- Where are you from?
- Legal.

678
00:52:59,706 --> 00:53:02,827
Can I ask you a question hypothetically?
It's a bit odd.

679
00:53:03,709 --> 00:53:09,229
If this was your last birthday party you're ever
gonna have how would you celebrate it?

680
00:53:11,669 --> 00:53:14,141
I'd do whatever I wanted to do.

681
00:53:14,142 --> 00:53:16,879
with whoever I wanted to do it.

682
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:51,691
Yes, sir, I understand.

683
00:53:51,692 --> 00:53:54,859
No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

684
00:53:55,695 --> 00:53:57,861
Sir, I personally guarantee that
within 24 hours

685
00:53:57,885 --> 00:53:59,948
Iron Man will be
back on watch.

686
00:54:07,746 --> 00:54:09,746
Hey, Pepper ...

687
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,912
- I'm gonna go get some air.
- What's wrong?

688
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,915
- I don't know what to do.
- You gotta be kidding me.

689
00:54:21,711 --> 00:54:24,712
- That's it, I'm gonna make a...
- No, no, don't call anyone.

690
00:54:24,713 --> 00:54:26,792
This is ridiculous I just stuck my neck up
for this guy.

691
00:54:26,793 --> 00:54:29,714
I know. I get it. I'm gonna handle it okay,
just let me handle it.

692
00:54:29,715 --> 00:54:32,881
Handle it, or I'm gonna have to.

693
00:54:33,717 --> 00:54:36,883
You know the question I get asked most often is
Tony how do you go to the bathroom with the suit?

694
00:54:40,721 --> 00:54:43,887
Just like that.

695
00:54:46,142 --> 00:54:48,935
Does this guy know how to throw a party
or what?

696
00:54:52,773 --> 00:54:54,772
I love you.

697
00:54:54,773 --> 00:54:59,608
Unbelievable. Thank you so much
Tony, we all thank you so much for such a

698
00:54:59,777 --> 00:55:02,735
wonderful night. We're gonna say
Good night now

699
00:55:02,736 --> 00:55:04,735
and thank you all for coming.

700
00:55:04,736 --> 00:55:07,945
No, no, wait, we can't, we didn't bring out the cake
we didn't blow out the candle.

701
00:55:07,946 --> 00:55:09,739
- You're out of control okay
- I'm out of control?

702
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,696
- Trust me on this one okay?
- You're out of control gorgeous

703
00:55:11,697 --> 00:55:14,802
- It's time to go to bed.
- Give me a little smooch.

704
00:55:14,826 --> 00:55:16,785
Come on you know you want to.

705
00:55:16,787 --> 00:55:17,847
You just peed the suit.

706
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:20,172
- I know, has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

707
00:55:20,173 --> 00:55:22,702
- You can drink that water.
- Just send everybody home, okay.

708
00:55:22,703 --> 00:55:24,784
- It's time to...
- If you say so.

709
00:55:24,785 --> 00:55:26,785
Okay, I'll take this.

710
00:55:26,786 --> 00:55:29,750
You take that.

711
00:55:29,751 --> 00:55:32,752
Pepper Potts.

712
00:55:32,754 --> 00:55:34,753
She's right.
The party is over.

713
00:55:34,754 --> 00:55:37,799
Then again the party was over for me
like an hour and a half ago.

714
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,965
The after party
starts in 15 minutes!

715
00:55:43,803 --> 00:55:46,986
And if anybody, Pepper, doesn't like it,

716
00:55:47,283 --> 00:55:49,883
there's the door.

717
00:55:59,726 --> 00:56:02,891
Shoot!

718
00:56:08,774 --> 00:56:11,939
Shoot!

719
00:56:19,781 --> 00:56:22,990
Shoot!

720
00:56:25,828 --> 00:56:28,907
Me!

721
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:32,909
I think she wants the Gallanger!

722
00:56:34,747 --> 00:56:37,912
There you go!

723
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:43,916
I'm only gonna say this once.

724
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:49,789
Get out!

725
00:56:54,627 --> 00:56:57,794
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

726
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:01,630
Goldstein.

727
00:57:01,632 --> 00:57:02,632
Yes, Mr. Stark?

728
00:57:02,633 --> 00:57:05,798
Give me a fat beat to beat
my buddy's ass to...

729
00:57:09,783 --> 00:57:12,759
I told you to shut it down.

730
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,766
Now, put that thing back where you found it
before someone gets hurt.

731
00:57:32,564 --> 00:57:35,816
Really?

732
00:57:41,865 --> 00:57:45,344
Sorry pal, but
Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.

733
00:57:46,033 --> 00:57:49,780
Suck at this!

734
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,578
Had enough?

735
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:00,622
- Natalie!
- Ms. Potts ...

736
00:58:00,623 --> 00:58:04,518
Don't you Ms. Potts me. I'm on to you.
You know what, ever since you came here...

737
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:11,585
Pepper!

738
00:58:11,586 --> 00:58:14,752
Let's get out of here!

739
00:58:18,634 --> 00:58:21,843
You want it?
Take it!

740
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:47,815
Out!

741
00:59:02,661 --> 00:59:04,660
Put your hand down.

742
00:59:04,661 --> 00:59:06,662
You think you got what it takes
to wear that suit?

743
00:59:06,663 --> 00:59:08,699
- We don't have to do this, Tony.
- You wanna be a war machine?

744
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,131
- Take your shot.
- Put it down!

745
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:13,709
- You're gonna take your shot?
- Put it down, now!

746
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:16,833
- Drop it Tony
- Take it!

747
01:00:26,148 --> 01:00:30,488
<i>Tower this is Lt. Col. James Rhodes
eastbound for 3 miles,...</i>

748
01:01:15,609 --> 01:01:17,338
Colonel.

749
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,905
Major.

750
01:01:22,569 --> 01:01:23,689
Yeah.

751
01:01:25,788 --> 01:01:27,875
Let's take it inside.

752
01:01:27,876 --> 01:01:29,171
<i>Clear the area.</i>

753
01:01:51,888 --> 01:01:55,967
Sir! I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the donut.

754
01:01:59,631 --> 01:02:02,231
I told you I don't wanna
join your super secret boyband.

755
01:02:02,807 --> 01:02:05,974
No, see, I remember, you do
everything myself.

756
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,059
How's it workin out for you?

757
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:14,368
I'm sorry, I don't wanna get off on the wrong
foot, do I look in the patch or the eye?

758
01:02:15,726 --> 01:02:18,936
Honestly I'm a bit hungover
I'm not sure if you're real or if...

759
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:23,545
I am very real. I'm the realest
person you're ever gonna meet.

760
01:02:23,861 --> 01:02:27,331
- Just my luck. Where is the staff here?
- Oh, that's not lookin too good.

761
01:02:28,342 --> 01:02:30,636
It's getting worse.

762
01:02:31,735 --> 01:02:35,074
We've secured the perimeter, but I don't think
we should hold it for too much longer.

763
01:02:39,347 --> 01:02:42,469
- You're fired.
- That's not up to you.

764
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:45,654
- Tony... I want you to meet agent Romanoff
- Hi

765
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:49,692
I'm a Shield shadow
and I was tasked to you by Dr. Fury.

766
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:51,256
I suggest you apologize.

767
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:53,388
You've been very busy.

768
01:02:53,572 --> 01:02:56,911
Made your girl your CEO,
you've given away all your stuff.

769
01:02:57,008 --> 01:02:59,168
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

770
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:01,639
- If I didn't know better...
- You don't know better.

771
01:03:02,328 --> 01:03:04,247
I didn't give it to him.
He took it.

772
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:09,483
He took it? You're Iron Man
and he just took it?

773
01:03:09,667 --> 01:03:12,000
Little brother walked in there kicked your ass
and took your suit?

774
01:03:12,065 --> 01:03:13,659
Is that possible?

775
01:03:13,713 --> 01:03:16,235
According to Mr. Stark's database
security guidelines

776
01:03:16,236 --> 01:03:19,313
There are redundancies to prevent
unauthorized usage.

777
01:03:21,926 --> 01:03:24,317
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you? No, no, no!

778
01:03:24,414 --> 01:03:26,448
What do you want from me.

779
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:30,461
You have become a problem, a problem
I have to deal with.

780
01:03:30,462 --> 01:03:33,808
- Contrary to your belief, you are not
the center of my universe. - Yeah I get it.

781
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:38,193
I have bigger problems than you in the Southwest
region to deal with. Hit him.

782
01:03:39,813 --> 01:03:42,761
Are you gonna steal my kidney and sell it?

783
01:03:43,249 --> 01:03:46,458
Could you please not do anything
awful for 5 seconds?

784
01:03:46,651 --> 01:03:47,815
What did you just do to me?

785
01:03:47,816 --> 01:03:50,287
What did we just do for you.

786
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:54,288
That's lithium dioxide. It's gonna take the edge off.
We're trying to get you back to work.

787
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:58,812
- Give me a couple of boxes and I'll be right as rain.
- It's not a cure, it's just to break the symptoms.

788
01:03:58,866 --> 01:04:03,598
- Then the lag is gonna be an easy fix.
- Trust me I know I'm good at this stuff.

789
01:04:03,912 --> 01:04:06,347
I've been looking for a suitable replacement
for palladium.

790
01:04:06,348 --> 01:04:10,254
I've tried every combination, every permutation of
every known element.

791
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:13,820
Well, I'm here to tell you
you haven't tried them all.

792
01:04:15,353 --> 01:04:18,171
Hey, hey, hey.
Special delivery.

793
01:04:18,398 --> 01:04:19,824
Candygram!

794
01:04:23,662 --> 01:04:25,913
I brought you something.

795
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:33,613
- We got you the bird, pal.
- This is not my bird.

796
01:04:34,014 --> 01:04:37,352
What do you mean?
That's the bird.

797
01:04:37,353 --> 01:04:39,050
I pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.

798
01:04:39,104 --> 01:04:41,452
- It's a great bird.
- It's a beautiful bird.

799
01:04:41,453 --> 01:04:45,880
- We got this all the way from Russia.
- Hey man, it's not my bird.

800
01:04:47,847 --> 01:04:52,188
Well listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean this is a gorgeous bird.

801
01:04:52,285 --> 01:04:56,146
I mean, look, don't get so attached to
things, learn to let go.

802
01:04:59,245 --> 01:05:02,018
Wait a minute.
Jack, what is that?

803
01:05:02,246 --> 01:05:05,456
Is that...
That's not a helmet. What is that?

804
01:05:13,861 --> 01:05:17,592
Ivan... What's this?
Jack?

805
01:05:18,384 --> 01:05:23,072
Is that a helmet? It doesn't look like a helmet
to me. How are you supposed to get a head in there?

806
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:26,338
- Jack, could you put your head in there? - No.
- Try to put your head in there.

807
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,206
Go ahead, try to put your head in there.

808
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:30,860
See Ivan, he can't put his head in
there. That's...

809
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,544
That's not a helmet, it's a head.

810
01:05:33,557 --> 01:05:34,994
I need to put a guy in there.

811
01:05:34,995 --> 01:05:38,993
I need to fit a person
in that suit, you understand?

812
01:05:39,264 --> 01:05:40,386
Drone better.

813
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,212
What? Drone better?
Why is drone better?

814
01:05:42,213 --> 01:05:44,136
Why drone better?

815
01:05:44,137 --> 01:05:46,060
People make problem.

816
01:05:46,118 --> 01:05:48,042
Trust me,
drone better.

817
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:52,827
Ivan, you know I like you.
I got you the bird.

818
01:05:53,402 --> 01:05:58,177
You said no problem.
That's what you said to me, you said no problem.

819
01:05:58,274 --> 01:06:01,189
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

820
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,233
Like Iron Man, you understand?

821
01:06:03,234 --> 01:06:06,660
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

822
01:06:07,192 --> 01:06:08,749
Hey, man...

823
01:06:10,063 --> 01:06:13,176
Don't get to attached to things.

824
01:06:13,192 --> 01:06:15,013
Learn to let go.

825
01:06:18,372 --> 01:06:21,720
These drones better steal the show, Ivan.

826
01:06:21,721 --> 01:06:25,496
You understand? They better
rock my world, Ivan.

827
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:36,850
Unbelievable.

828
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:39,808
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

829
01:06:39,905 --> 01:06:43,376
- It's functional?
- Fully mission-capable.

830
01:06:43,515 --> 01:06:46,638
Good. Get Hammer down here
to weaponize it.

831
01:06:47,831 --> 01:06:48,778
Sir?

832
01:06:48,779 --> 01:06:51,774
Justin Hammer's making a weapons presentation
at the expo.

833
01:06:51,804 --> 01:06:53,432
We'd like this to introduce it.

834
01:06:53,433 --> 01:06:54,999
Sir, I don't believe that the expo is...

835
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,035
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

836
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,827
We've got to make this happen.

837
01:06:59,828 --> 01:07:03,036
- Yes general, but the...
- It's also an order.

838
01:07:03,482 --> 01:07:04,951
Yes, sir.

839
01:07:05,136 --> 01:07:08,127
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

840
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:10,519
Thank you, sir.

841
01:07:16,663 --> 01:07:20,351
That thing in your chest is
based on unfinished technology.

842
01:07:20,534 --> 01:07:23,309
No it was finished,
it's never been particularly effective until

843
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:26,353
I've miniaturized it
and put it in my...

844
01:07:26,538 --> 01:07:29,775
No, Howard said that the arc reactor was
a stepping stone to something greater.

845
01:07:29,881 --> 01:07:31,402
He was about to kick off an energy race

846
01:07:31,445 --> 01:07:34,532
That was gonna dwarf
the arms race.

847
01:07:34,715 --> 01:07:37,933
He was on to something big,
something so big

848
01:07:37,934 --> 01:07:41,623
that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor
look like a AAA battery.

849
01:07:41,632 --> 01:07:44,067
Just him? Or was Anton Vanko in on this too?

850
01:07:44,068 --> 01:07:47,365
Anton Vanko is the other
side of that coin.

851
01:07:47,374 --> 01:07:49,650
Anton saw it as a
way to get rich.

852
01:07:49,651 --> 01:07:52,070
When your father found
out he had him deported.

853
01:07:52,071 --> 01:07:55,726
When the Russians found out he couldn't
deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia

854
01:07:55,727 --> 01:07:58,509
and he spent the next 20 years on a vodka
fuel rage.

855
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:01,067
Not quite the environment you wanna raise
a kid in.

856
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:05,242
His son you had the misfortune of
crossing paths with in Monaco.

857
01:08:05,644 --> 01:08:07,910
You told me I hadn't tried everything.
What do you mean I haven't tried everything?

858
01:08:07,939 --> 01:08:09,505
What haven't I tried?

859
01:08:09,507 --> 01:08:13,333
He said that you were the only person with the
means and knowledge

860
01:08:13,561 --> 01:08:15,683
to finish what he started.

861
01:08:15,693 --> 01:08:17,075
He said that?

862
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:19,684
Are you that guy?
Huh? Are you?

863
01:08:19,999 --> 01:08:25,861
Because if you are then
you can solve the riddle of your heart.

864
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:33,396
I don't know where you get your information, but
he wasn't my biggest fan.

865
01:08:33,397 --> 01:08:36,434
- What do your remember about your dad huh?
- He was cold, he was calculating...

866
01:08:36,435 --> 01:08:39,487
He never told me he loved me
he never even told me he liked me.

867
01:08:39,488 --> 01:08:44,097
So it's a little tough for me to digest what're you telling
me he said the whole future is riding on me

868
01:08:44,098 --> 01:08:46,524
and he's passing it down...
I don't get that.

869
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:48,266
We're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

870
01:08:48,267 --> 01:08:49,831
was when he shipped me off to boarding school.

871
01:08:49,868 --> 01:08:50,971
That's not true.

872
01:08:50,972 --> 01:08:53,485
Well, then clearly you know my dad better
than I did.

873
01:08:53,756 --> 01:08:55,826
As a matter of fact I did.

874
01:08:55,947 --> 01:08:57,704
He was one of the founding members
of The Shield.

875
01:08:57,758 --> 01:09:00,621
- What?
- I got a two o'clock.

876
01:09:00,622 --> 01:09:02,455
Wait, wait, what's this?

877
01:09:02,456 --> 01:09:04,326
- Okay, you're good, right?
- No I'm not good.

878
01:09:04,327 --> 01:09:07,318
- You got this, right? - Got what? I don't
even know what I'm supposed to get.

879
01:09:07,372 --> 01:09:10,546
Natasha will remain
a floater at Stark with her cover intact

880
01:09:10,547 --> 01:09:12,577
and you remember
Agent Colson right?

881
01:09:12,579 --> 01:09:14,053
Yeah.

882
01:09:14,123 --> 01:09:15,408
Oh, and Tony...

883
01:09:16,463 --> 01:09:19,629
Remember, I got my eye on you.

884
01:09:25,642 --> 01:09:28,224
We've disabled all communications,
no contact with the outside world.

885
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:30,059
Good luck.

886
01:09:34,473 --> 01:09:36,298
Please...

887
01:09:36,299 --> 01:09:39,649
First thing I need a little body work.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

888
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:44,346
If you could send of your goon squad down to the Coffee Bean
across the street or Starbucks, that'll be nice.

889
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:46,993
I'm not here for that.
I've been authorized by

890
01:09:46,994 --> 01:09:49,783
Director Fury to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

891
01:09:49,784 --> 01:09:52,524
- If you attempt to leave - Right
- or play any games

892
01:09:52,525 --> 01:09:53,916
I will taze you and watch

893
01:09:53,917 --> 01:09:55,734
Supernanny while you
drool into the carpet. Okay?

894
01:09:56,178 --> 01:09:59,649
- I think I got it, yeah.
- Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

895
01:10:26,281 --> 01:10:28,108
Think this
is the power source?

896
01:10:28,109 --> 01:10:31,019
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.

897
01:10:31,029 --> 01:10:33,188
Let's just focus
on arming it, alright?

898
01:10:34,054 --> 01:10:35,808
Yes, sir.

899
01:10:35,809 --> 01:10:37,233
<i> Oh, yes!</i>

900
01:10:37,548 --> 01:10:39,495
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

901
01:10:39,549 --> 01:10:41,540
Is it my birthday?

902
01:10:41,594 --> 01:10:45,107
You gotta.. what did you do?
What did you do?

903
01:10:48,075 --> 01:10:50,762
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes it is.

904
01:10:51,215 --> 01:10:54,381
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

905
01:10:54,564 --> 01:10:56,611
What am I gonna do for you?

906
01:10:56,651 --> 01:10:59,427
First thing I'm gonna do for you is
I'm gonna upgrade your software,

907
01:11:02,075 --> 01:11:05,269
I'm talking about firepower.

908
01:11:06,675 --> 01:11:08,796
Well you're talking to the right guy.

909
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:13,042
Claridge Hi-Tec semi-automatic 9 mm pistol.

910
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:16,654
Too downtown?
I agree.

911
01:11:17,099 --> 01:11:19,568
M-24 shotgun pump action.

912
01:11:19,969 --> 01:11:22,614
5-round magazine, but
you know what, you're not a hunter.

913
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:24,685
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

914
01:11:24,702 --> 01:11:27,501
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

915
01:11:27,502 --> 01:11:29,268
They do make something better than waffles.

916
01:11:30,367 --> 01:11:32,765
It's beautiful, but I can tell this isn't
disco enough for you

917
01:11:32,766 --> 01:11:34,280
so I'm gonna put it right here.

918
01:11:34,281 --> 01:11:38,885
You're looking at a Milkor 40 mm grenade launcher.
Tear gas, smoke.

919
01:11:38,886 --> 01:11:41,263
Hippie control.
You're tough.

920
01:11:41,264 --> 01:11:44,195
Let me tell you something,
Size does matter.

921
01:11:44,196 --> 01:11:46,025
Don't let anyone tell you different.

922
01:11:46,188 --> 01:11:51,027
This is an M134 7.62 minigun.
Six individual barrels.

923
01:11:51,028 --> 01:11:53,452
The torso taker, powder maker.

924
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:57,289
Our boys in uniform call it Uncle Gazpacho
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

925
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:01,796
Okay.

926
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:07,470
These are the Cubans baby.
These are the Cohibas, the Montecristos...

927
01:12:08,843 --> 01:12:11,094
That's a kinetic-kill sidewinder vehicle

928
01:12:11,095 --> 01:12:15,314
with a secondary cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine
RDX burst.

929
01:12:15,935 --> 01:12:19,523
It's capable of busting a bunker under
the bunker you just busted.

930
01:12:19,524 --> 01:12:21,525
If it were any smarter it would write a book.

931
01:12:21,526 --> 01:12:24,873
A book that would make Ulysses look like
it was written in crayon.

932
01:12:25,396 --> 01:12:27,080
And would read it to you.

933
01:12:27,827 --> 01:12:31,413
This is my Eiffel Tower,
This is my Rachmaninoff's Third.

934
01:12:31,414 --> 01:12:35,424
My Pieta. It's completely
elegant, it's bafflingly beautiful.

935
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:40,056
And it's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

936
01:12:41,386 --> 01:12:43,893
I call it the Ex-Wife.

937
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:50,319
That's the best I got.

938
01:12:55,322 --> 01:12:58,194
How are you gonna do this? Give me something.
You're like a sphinx.

939
01:12:58,242 --> 01:12:59,748
I can't read you.

940
01:13:00,244 --> 01:13:01,495
I think I'll take it.

941
01:13:01,497 --> 01:13:04,129
- Which one?
- All of it.

942
01:13:06,085 --> 01:13:07,424
All of it?

943
01:13:40,339 --> 01:13:41,512
<i>Action.</i>

944
01:13:44,679 --> 01:13:48,537
<i>Everything is achievable through technology.</i>

945
01:13:48,538 --> 01:13:50,858
<i>Better living,
robust health.</i>

946
01:13:51,062 --> 01:13:54,487
<i>And for the first time
in human history...</i>

947
01:13:54,525 --> 01:13:57,242
<i>the possibility of world peace.</i>

948
01:13:57,446 --> 01:14:00,887
<i>I'm Howard Stark. And everything
you'll need for the future,</i>

949
01:14:00,888 --> 01:14:02,414
<i>can be found right here.</i>

950
01:14:02,619 --> 01:14:06,629
<i> City of Future, City of
of Tomorrow? Hang on.</i>

951
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:12,924
<i>I'm Howard Stark.</i>

952
01:14:12,925 --> 01:14:15,932
<i> And everything you'll need in
the future can be found right here.</i>

953
01:14:16,721 --> 01:14:21,440
<i> So, from all of us in
Stark Industries I would like to personally...</i>

954
01:14:22,604 --> 01:14:24,772
<i> Tony? What are you doing back there?
What is that?</i>

955
01:14:24,773 --> 01:14:27,740
<i>Put it back.
Put it back where you got it from.</i>

956
01:14:28,779 --> 01:14:30,702
<i>Where is your mother?
Maria...</i>

957
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,540
<i>Go on, go, go, go...</i>

958
01:14:35,455 --> 01:14:37,336
<i>Sorry I think we got the...</i>

959
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:40,424
<i>I'll come in in there...</i>

960
01:14:44,132 --> 01:14:45,910
<i>Are you waiting on me?</i>

961
01:14:47,554 --> 01:14:51,730
<i>So from all of us in
Stark Industries I'd like to personally show you...</i>

962
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,145
<i> my ass.</i>

963
01:14:54,146 --> 01:14:58,739
<i>I'd like to... This...
I can't... We have this don't we?</i>

964
01:14:58,819 --> 01:15:01,285
<i>That looks ridiculous.</i>

965
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,579
<i>Everything...</i>

966
01:15:04,743 --> 01:15:06,500
<i>is achievable...</i>

967
01:15:07,164 --> 01:15:08,420
<i>through technology.</i>

968
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:22,767
<i>Tony...</i>

969
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:27,027
<i>You're too young to understand this right now
so I thought I would put it on film for you.</i>

970
01:15:29,318 --> 01:15:31,408
<i> I built this for you.</i>

971
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,874
<i> And someday you'll realize that it represents
a whole lot more than just people's inventions.</i>

972
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:39,377
<i>It represents my life's work.</i>

973
01:15:40,082 --> 01:15:42,340
<i>This is key to the future.</i>

974
01:15:45,464 --> 01:15:48,055
<i>I'm limited by the technology
of my time.</i>

975
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:50,559
<i> But one day you'll figure this out.</i>

976
01:15:50,888 --> 01:15:55,398
<i>And when you do...
you will change the world.</i>

977
01:15:57,147 --> 01:16:01,448
<i> What is and always will be
my greatest creation...</i>

978
01:16:03,447 --> 01:16:05,120
<i>is you.</i>

979
01:16:24,767 --> 01:16:26,184
Hi, sir.

980
01:16:26,185 --> 01:16:29,000
- $6.
- I don't have any...

981
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:31,822
- No sir, that's too much.
- No it's fine, take that.

982
01:16:34,488 --> 01:16:36,015
Take it, take it.

983
01:16:36,261 --> 01:16:39,144
I don't like people hand me things so if you
could just drop that there that would be great.

984
01:16:39,453 --> 01:16:41,793
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

985
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,671
We believe in you!

986
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:46,967
It was an illegal seizure
of trademarked property.

987
01:16:47,005 --> 01:16:49,590
- Ms. Potts, Mr Stark is...
- Here.

988
01:16:49,591 --> 01:16:52,850
- He refuses to...
- I don't. It's fine. I'll just be a second.

989
01:16:53,222 --> 01:16:59,025
It's our position that Stark has the means to maintain
proprietary ownership of the Mark II platform.

990
01:16:59,438 --> 01:17:02,316
<i>When Mr. Stark announced he was the Iron Man</i>

991
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:06,530
<i>he was making a promise to America.</i>

992
01:17:06,531 --> 01:17:08,538
<i>Obviously he did not.</i>

993
01:17:08,784 --> 01:17:10,811
<i>Now we learn that his secretary,</i>

994
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:13,419
<i>a woman named
Virginia "Pepper" Potts,</i>

995
01:17:13,499 --> 01:17:15,834
<i>has been appointed CEO
of Stark Industries executive.</i>

996
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:18,128
<i>What are her qualifications?</i>

997
01:17:18,129 --> 01:17:18,754
No.

998
01:17:18,755 --> 01:17:21,221
- Ms. Potts is doing nothing to manage the terrible
situation... - Mute.

999
01:17:22,677 --> 01:17:27,433
Bert, don't tell me that we have the
best patent lawyers in the country

1000
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,232
and then not let me pursue this.

1001
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:30,937
I'll get this stuff out of here.

1002
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:33,070
Well then, tell the President
to sign an order.

1003
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:36,690
We'll talk about it at the expo.

1004
01:17:36,696 --> 01:17:38,911
Hammer's giving some presentation
tomorrow evening.

1005
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,703
- Will Tony Stark be there?
- Will I?

1006
01:17:42,704 --> 01:17:44,711
- No, he will not.
- I'd like to be.

1007
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:47,500
- Got a minute?
- No.

1008
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:49,634
Come on, you just got off the phone.
30 seconds.

1009
01:17:52,425 --> 01:17:54,723
29 ... 28 ...

1010
01:17:54,928 --> 01:17:59,313
I was driving over here, and I thought
I was coming basically to apologize, but I'm not.

1011
01:17:59,392 --> 01:18:03,361
- You didn't come here to apologize?
- That goes without saying, and I'm working on that.

1012
01:18:03,607 --> 01:18:07,360
But I haven't been entirely up front
with you

1013
01:18:07,361 --> 01:18:09,030
and I just wanna try to make good,

1014
01:18:09,031 --> 01:18:12,492
Can I move this?
This is crazy I got ferris wheel...

1015
01:18:12,493 --> 01:18:13,707
No.

1016
01:18:16,624 --> 01:18:18,464
Do you know how short life is?

1017
01:18:19,044 --> 01:18:22,046
And if I never got to express...

1018
01:18:22,047 --> 01:18:24,926
and by the way somewhat revelatory to me,

1019
01:18:24,927 --> 01:18:27,742
I don't care... I mean, I care, it would be nice,

1020
01:18:27,743 --> 01:18:30,605
I'm not expecting you to...
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

1021
01:18:31,018 --> 01:18:33,938
Let me just stop you right here, okay,
because if you say "I"

1022
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:37,323
one more time, I'm gonna actually hurl
something at your head, I think.

1023
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:42,115
I am trying to run a company.
Do you know have any idea what that entails?

1024
01:18:42,116 --> 01:18:42,996
Yes.

1025
01:18:43,075 --> 01:18:46,037
People are relying on you to be
Iron Man, and you've disappeared.

1026
01:18:46,038 --> 01:18:49,421
All I'm doing is putting out your fire
and taking the heat for it.

1027
01:18:52,005 --> 01:18:55,722
I am trying to do the job that you
were meant to do.

1028
01:18:59,223 --> 01:19:01,146
Did you bring me strawberries?

1029
01:19:02,476 --> 01:19:06,726
Did you know that there is only one thing
on earth that I am allergic to?

1030
01:19:06,727 --> 01:19:07,900
You're allergic to strawberries, uh-uh.

1031
01:19:10,821 --> 01:19:14,539
This is progress, Pepper. I knew there
was correlation between you and this...

1032
01:19:15,661 --> 01:19:17,834
- I need you...
- And I need you too, that's what I'm trying to say.

1033
01:19:17,913 --> 01:19:20,422
to leave now.

1034
01:19:25,006 --> 01:19:26,179
Ms Potts.

1035
01:19:26,926 --> 01:19:30,393
- Hi, come on in.
- Wheel's up in 25 minutes.

1036
01:19:30,764 --> 01:19:32,333
Thank you.

1037
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:35,103
Anything else, boss?

1038
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:38,737
- I'm good Hap.
- I'll be just... another minute.

1039
01:19:39,734 --> 01:19:41,658
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

1040
01:19:45,575 --> 01:19:46,768
No.

1041
01:19:48,914 --> 01:19:51,713
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?

1042
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:54,425
Here at Stark... Enterprises.

1043
01:19:55,047 --> 01:19:56,720
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

1044
01:19:57,425 --> 01:20:00,761
I thought you two
didn't get along.

1045
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:03,187
- No, that's not so.
- It's just me you don't care for.

1046
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:05,059
No? Nothing?

1047
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:09,351
Actually while you're here maybe you and Natalie
could discuss the matter of personal belonging.

1048
01:20:09,352 --> 01:20:10,530
Absolutely.

1049
01:20:17,493 --> 01:20:21,747
- I'm surprised you could keep your mouth shut.
- You're good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.

1050
01:20:21,748 --> 01:20:22,593
How do you do it?

1051
01:20:22,594 --> 01:20:25,362
You're a triple impostor.
I've never seen anything like it.

1052
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:27,448
Is there anything real about you?
Do you even speak Latin?

1053
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:29,634
Fallaces sunt rerum species.

1054
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,585
Which means?
What did you just say?

1055
01:20:32,586 --> 01:20:35,385
It means you can either drive yourself home
or I can have you collected.

1056
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:38,974
You're good!

1057
01:21:38,632 --> 01:21:41,599
Jarvis, could you kindly
backform a digital wireframe?

1058
01:21:41,657 --> 01:21:43,268
I need a manipulable projection.

1059
01:21:51,524 --> 01:21:54,825
1974 Stark Expo model scanning
complete, sir.

1060
01:21:56,865 --> 01:22:01,417
- How many buildings are there?
- Am I to include the Belgian waffles stand?

1061
01:22:01,622 --> 01:22:03,628
It was rhetorical, just show me.

1062
01:22:16,475 --> 01:22:18,523
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?

1063
01:22:19,311 --> 01:22:21,152
Not unlike an atom.

1064
01:22:21,398 --> 01:22:25,324
In which case, the nucleus... would be here.

1065
01:22:26,195 --> 01:22:27,701
Highlight the Unisphere.

1066
01:22:36,606 --> 01:22:41,887
- Notice the footpaths. Get rid of them.
- What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?

1067
01:22:42,259 --> 01:22:45,517
I'm discovering,... correction, rediscovering...

1068
01:22:46,556 --> 01:22:47,853
... a new element.

1069
01:22:49,017 --> 01:22:52,313
Lose the landscape and the shrubbery there,
trees,

1070
01:22:52,314 --> 01:22:54,279
parking lots, exits, entrances.

1071
01:22:58,697 --> 01:23:01,288
Structre protons and neutrons

1072
01:23:01,451 --> 01:23:05,127
using flags the pavillions as the framework.

1073
01:23:30,072 --> 01:23:32,413
Dead for almost 20 years...

1074
01:23:33,869 --> 01:23:35,917
...still taking me to school.

1075
01:23:41,254 --> 01:23:45,973
The proposed element should serve
as a viable replacement for palladium.

1076
01:23:46,469 --> 01:23:47,636
Thanks, Dad.

1077
01:23:47,638 --> 01:23:50,604
Unfortunately,
it is impossible to synthesize.

1078
01:23:54,814 --> 01:23:58,698
Get ready for major remodel, fellas!
We're back in hardware mode.

1079
01:24:46,299 --> 01:24:48,734
How did you break the perimeter?

1080
01:24:48,803 --> 01:24:50,924
That was like three years ago.
Where have you been?

1081
01:24:50,925 --> 01:24:54,146
- I was doing some stuff.
- Yeah, well, me too and it worked.

1082
01:24:55,645 --> 01:24:59,857
Hey, I'm playing for the home team, Colson
You and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

1083
01:24:59,858 --> 01:25:01,781
Let me work, or break my balls?

1084
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:04,703
What's this doing here?

1085
01:25:07,493 --> 01:25:08,791
That's it.

1086
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:10,836
Bring it to me.

1087
01:25:11,165 --> 01:25:13,589
- You know what this is?
- It's exactly what I need to make this work.

1088
01:25:15,358 --> 01:25:16,719
Lift the coil.

1089
01:25:16,631 --> 01:25:19,681
Go, go! Put your knees under it.
There you go.

1090
01:25:19,718 --> 01:25:21,141
And...

1091
01:25:21,888 --> 01:25:23,812
- Drop it. - Okay.

1092
01:25:27,145 --> 01:25:28,234
Perfectly level.

1093
01:25:29,105 --> 01:25:31,155
- I'm busy. What do you want?
- Nothing.

1094
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:33,866
Good bye. I've been reassigned.

1095
01:25:33,987 --> 01:25:35,571
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

1096
01:25:35,572 --> 01:25:38,373
- Fantastic, the land of enchantment.
- So I'm told.

1097
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:40,166
- Secret stuff.
- Something like that.

1098
01:25:41,622 --> 01:25:42,753
- Good luck.
- Bye.

1099
01:25:43,249 --> 01:25:44,918
- Thanks.
- We need you.

1100
01:25:44,919 --> 01:25:47,635
- Yeah, more than you know.
- Not that much.

1101
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:08,371
<i>Initializing
prismatic accelerator.</i>

1102
01:26:14,833 --> 01:26:17,382
<i>Approaching maximum power.</i>

1103
01:27:04,733 --> 01:27:06,114
That was easy.

1104
01:27:22,486 --> 01:27:24,389
<i>Congratulations, sir.</i>

1105
01:27:26,095 --> 01:27:28,435
<i>You have created a new element.</i>

1106
01:27:36,505 --> 01:27:40,034
<i>Sir, the reactor has accepted the
modified core.</i>

1107
01:27:40,697 --> 01:27:42,829
<i>I will begin running diagnostics.</i>

1108
01:27:48,833 --> 01:27:50,590
Hey, Ivan.

1109
01:27:51,045 --> 01:27:55,216
<i>I got Senator Stern here. Thought we'd swing over
and look at some of the drone designs.</i>

1110
01:27:54,904 --> 01:27:58,768
- The drone is not going to be ready.
- Not ready... What do you mean?

1111
01:27:59,306 --> 01:28:02,355
It can make presentation
not demonstration.

1112
01:28:02,435 --> 01:28:07,404
- What the hell is the difference?
- Presentation, no fly, no shoot.

1113
01:28:07,483 --> 01:28:10,658
Wait. What can we make 'em do, I mean,

1114
01:28:10,716 --> 01:28:12,536
This is a weapons demonstration.

1115
01:28:12,657 --> 01:28:14,288
I can make salute.

1116
01:28:14,785 --> 01:28:17,375
You can make salute, what do you mean
make salute?

1117
01:28:17,538 --> 01:28:19,462
What the hell does that mean, Ivan?

1118
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:22,132
<i>It's not what we agreed to, okay.</i>

1119
01:28:22,149 --> 01:28:24,791
<i>You promised me suits, and then you promised
me drones.</i>

1120
01:28:24,792 --> 01:28:28,682
- Hey man, everything will be okay.
- This is not what I wanted.

1121
01:28:40,736 --> 01:28:43,494
Hey, there he is, the bird man.

1122
01:28:45,659 --> 01:28:47,583
Oh, now you like the bird, is that right?

1123
01:28:47,745 --> 01:28:50,920
Is that your bird?
I'm confused.

1124
01:28:51,542 --> 01:28:54,926
You said it wasn't, but now
it's like you're best of pals.

1125
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:56,594
You love that bird, don't you?

1126
01:28:57,341 --> 01:28:59,014
You know what? Take the bird.

1127
01:29:04,184 --> 01:29:06,691
Take his pillows too. Both of them.

1128
01:29:07,605 --> 01:29:09,445
And shoes, take his shoes.

1129
01:29:13,821 --> 01:29:15,370
I took your stuff.

1130
01:29:15,824 --> 01:29:18,957
How does that make you feel?
You feel bad?

1131
01:29:19,496 --> 01:29:22,463
Good. Cause that's how I feel!

1132
01:29:24,169 --> 01:29:26,175
We had a contract!

1133
01:29:26,380 --> 01:29:31,433
I saved your life
and you give me suits.

1134
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:35,397
That was our deal.
And you did not deliver.

1135
01:29:36,394 --> 01:29:39,318
I don't know if you're a genius
or a fraud.

1136
01:29:39,324 --> 01:29:41,237
I don't know what you are!

1137
01:29:43,236 --> 01:29:46,452
Something really, really great fell into my lap.

1138
01:29:47,324 --> 01:29:50,458
If it hadn't, I'd be at your mercy tonight.

1139
01:29:50,663 --> 01:29:54,708
Now I have a piece of Stark tech, and I pimped
out myself.

1140
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:59,131
Now your overpriced paperweights are gonna
look like a backdrop to my demonstration.

1141
01:29:59,132 --> 01:30:01,514
You dig what I'm gettin' at here?

1142
01:30:03,972 --> 01:30:08,315
I don't know if you noticed,
but I don't speak Russian!

1143
01:30:11,774 --> 01:30:16,951
I'm gonna leave now. I'm gonna go to the expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

1144
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:21,708
See these guys? They're your babysitters.
They are not to be trifled with.

1145
01:30:22,705 --> 01:30:26,172
When I get back, we're gonna renegotiate the
terms of our agreement.

1146
01:30:27,378 --> 01:30:29,838
And you're gonna make good on our arrangements.

1147
01:30:29,839 --> 01:30:32,514
Because if you don't, you're gonna be exactly what you were
when I found you,

1148
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:34,975
a dead man.

1149
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:36,769
You got that?

1150
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:40,024
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

1151
01:30:49,219 --> 01:30:51,664
Dummy. You.
Can we clean up this mess?

1152
01:30:52,328 --> 01:30:56,500
- Incoming call with a blocked number, sir.
- Phone privileges reinstated.

1153
01:30:56,510 --> 01:30:58,173
Lovely.

1154
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:03,096
- Colson, how's land of enchantment?
- Hey, Tony, how you doin'?

1155
01:31:04,302 --> 01:31:05,933
- I doubled cycle. - You what?

1156
01:31:07,056 --> 01:31:11,477
You told me double cycle's
more power. Good advice.

1157
01:31:11,478 --> 01:31:15,112
- You sound pretty spitely for a dead guy.
- You too.

1158
01:31:17,361 --> 01:31:18,403
- Trace it. - Sir.

1159
01:31:18,404 --> 01:31:22,914
Now the true history of
Stark name will be written.

1160
01:31:22,952 --> 01:31:25,960
- Jarvis, where he is?
- Accessing the Oracle grid.

1161
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:28,046
Eastern seaboard.

1162
01:31:28,167 --> 01:31:32,218
What your father did to my family
over 40 years

1163
01:31:32,965 --> 01:31:35,426
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

1164
01:31:35,427 --> 01:31:37,887
Sounds good, let's get together
and hash it out.

1165
01:31:37,888 --> 01:31:41,606
Tri-state area.
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.

1166
01:31:41,811 --> 01:31:43,609
I hope you're ready.

1167
01:31:46,483 --> 01:31:48,324
<i>Call trace incomplete.</i>

1168
01:31:59,041 --> 01:32:01,674
- Sir.
- You wanna run some tests, run 'em.

1169
01:32:03,131 --> 01:32:04,923
And assemble the suit while you're at it
put it together now.

1170
01:32:04,924 --> 01:32:07,390
- We are unclear as to the effects...
- I don't wanna hear it, Jarvis!

1171
01:32:11,558 --> 01:32:14,900
It tastes like coconut...
and metal.

1172
01:32:29,519 --> 01:32:33,091
I'll keep the car down here, alright.
- Thank you Happy.

1173
01:32:33,108 --> 01:32:38,682
<i>Justin Hammer, his presentation will begin shortly
in the main pavilion.</i>

1174
01:32:58,705 --> 01:33:01,754
That's what I'm talking about!
Thanks for coming.

1175
01:33:02,918 --> 01:33:05,968
Ladies and gentlemen,
for far too long

1176
01:33:06,465 --> 01:33:09,598
this country has had to place its brave men
and women in harm's way.

1177
01:33:09,886 --> 01:33:12,122
But then the Iron Man arrived
and we thought that

1178
01:33:12,181 --> 01:33:14,730
the days of losing lives were behind us.

1179
01:33:15,935 --> 01:33:18,359
Sadly that technology was kept out of reach.

1180
01:33:18,438 --> 01:33:20,863
That's not fair. That's not right.

1181
01:33:21,193 --> 01:33:23,528
- And it's just too bad.
- Oh, lord...

1182
01:33:23,529 --> 01:33:28,498
Regardless it was an impressive innovation
one that grabbed headlines the world over.

1183
01:33:28,953 --> 01:33:34,131
Today, my friends, the press
is faced with quite a different problem.

1184
01:33:34,752 --> 01:33:38,052
They are about to run out of ink.

1185
01:33:42,888 --> 01:33:44,227
Get that out of here.

1186
01:33:45,725 --> 01:33:47,524
Ladies and gentlemen...

1187
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:50,611
...today I present to you

1188
01:33:51,107 --> 01:33:54,575
...the new face of the United States military!

1189
01:33:55,614 --> 01:33:57,328
The Hammer drone!

1190
01:33:59,598 --> 01:34:01,709
Army!

1191
01:34:13,825 --> 01:34:18,732
Navy!

1192
01:34:25,299 --> 01:34:28,035
Air Force!

1193
01:34:34,394 --> 01:34:37,257
Marines!

1194
01:34:53,795 --> 01:34:57,179
That's a hell of a lot better than some
cheerleaders, let me tell you.

1195
01:34:58,447 --> 01:35:01,163
But as revolutionary
as this technology is,

1196
01:35:01,201 --> 01:35:05,044
there will always be a need for a man
to be present at the theater of war.

1197
01:35:05,457 --> 01:35:10,581
Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud
to present to you the very first prototype

1198
01:35:10,582 --> 01:35:14,447
the variable threat response battle suit

1199
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:17,726
and its pilot Air Force Lt. Col. James Rhodes.

1200
01:35:18,672 --> 01:35:20,287
What?

1201
01:35:41,098 --> 01:35:44,276
For America and its allies,
Hammer Industries, is reporting...

1202
01:36:01,855 --> 01:36:03,856
We got trouble.

1203
01:36:03,857 --> 01:36:05,858
Tony, there are civilians present.

1204
01:36:05,859 --> 01:36:08,399
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.

1205
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,000
Give them a wave.

1206
01:36:11,513 --> 01:36:13,801
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.

1207
01:36:13,802 --> 01:36:16,055
You gotta trust
me for the next five minutes.

1208
01:36:16,056 --> 01:36:18,057
I tried that and
I got tossed around your house, remember?

1209
01:36:18,058 --> 01:36:20,524
I think he's working with Vanko.

1210
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:23,704
Vanko is alive?

1211
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:26,818
- Where is he?
- What?

1212
01:36:26,819 --> 01:36:28,535
Where is Vanko?

1213
01:36:28,536 --> 01:36:30,824
- Who?
- Tell me.

1214
01:36:30,825 --> 01:36:33,717
What are you doing here, man?

1215
01:36:38,236 --> 01:36:41,551
- Is that you?
- No, I'm not doing that, it's not me.

1216
01:36:41,553 --> 01:36:44,732
I can't move.
I'm locked up, I'm locked up.

1217
01:36:45,141 --> 01:36:48,561
Get out of here! Go!
The whole system's been compromised!

1218
01:36:48,562 --> 01:36:51,700
Let's take it outside.

1219
01:37:02,539 --> 01:37:05,719
No!

1220
01:37:13,762 --> 01:37:16,733
- Jarvis, break in, I need to own him.
- Yes, sir.

1221
01:37:19,562 --> 01:37:22,252
Tony, I'm locked on I have target locked.

1222
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:25,745
- On what?
- On you.

1223
01:37:29,095 --> 01:37:31,514
Tony on your six.

1224
01:37:47,558 --> 01:37:50,560
- What's going on, what's happening?
- The software's been overwritten.

1225
01:37:50,561 --> 01:37:52,564
What?
What do you mean it's been overwritten?

1226
01:37:52,565 --> 01:37:55,103
- I think he slaved the drones.
- It is impossible.

1227
01:37:55,104 --> 01:37:56,568
- Call the guards
- All the phones are down, sir.

1228
01:37:56,569 --> 01:37:59,573
- Then call their cells.
- Their cell phones are not working either, sir.

1229
01:37:59,574 --> 01:38:02,576
- He's locked us out of the mainframe.
- Who's locked you out of the mainframe?

1230
01:38:02,577 --> 01:38:05,116
Please, please, go away.
I got this handled.

1231
01:38:05,117 --> 01:38:06,582
- Have you now?
- Yes I do.

1232
01:38:06,583 --> 01:38:08,585
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up

1233
01:38:08,586 --> 01:38:11,124
This wouldn't be happening
Please now, go away!

1234
01:38:11,125 --> 01:38:12,589
Thank you.

1235
01:38:12,590 --> 01:38:15,552
Listen we gotta get these bitches outta here.

1236
01:38:15,553 --> 01:38:17,779
You're gonna tell me who's behind
this.

1237
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:19,557
Who's behind this?

1238
01:38:19,558 --> 01:38:22,144
Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

1239
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:25,216
- Where is he?
- He's at my facility.

1240
01:38:28,612 --> 01:38:32,006
- I need NYPD please.
- No, no, no honey.

1241
01:38:32,054 --> 01:38:33,205
Don't call the authorities!

1242
01:38:33,326 --> 01:38:36,001
Step aside.

1243
01:38:36,581 --> 01:38:38,171
Tell me everything you know. Go.

1244
01:38:45,551 --> 01:38:49,144
- How we doing Jarvis?
- Remote reboot unsuccessful.

1245
01:39:08,415 --> 01:39:12,586
- No one's answering the phone, what's going on?
- Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.

1246
01:39:12,587 --> 01:39:13,963
I'm not taking you anywhere.

1247
01:39:13,964 --> 01:39:17,306
- Fine. You want me to drive?
- No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

1248
01:40:16,214 --> 01:40:17,803
Nice work, kid.

1249
01:40:19,552 --> 01:40:22,935
- You got multiples coming down on you.
- Let's get this away from the expo.

1250
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:30,914
When we arrive I need you to watch the perimeter.

1251
01:40:30,983 --> 01:40:33,198
I'm gonna enter the facility and take down the target.

1252
01:40:36,783 --> 01:40:38,330
- Watch the road.
- I got it.

1253
01:41:09,952 --> 01:41:12,955
Listen, listen, a pack has peeled off and headed
back to the expo.

1254
01:41:12,956 --> 01:41:14,128
Got it.

1255
01:41:18,255 --> 01:41:22,306
I'm closing on you!
It's coming in hot, Tony! Watch it.

1256
01:41:37,697 --> 01:41:40,580
- Stay in the car!
- I'm not staying in the car.

1257
01:41:40,868 --> 01:41:43,585
- I said stay in the car.
- What are you wearing?

1258
01:41:46,125 --> 01:41:47,631
Look, I'm not letting you go in there alone.

1259
01:41:48,211 --> 01:41:50,802
- You wanna help? Keep the car running.
- Okay.

1260
01:41:54,636 --> 01:41:56,768
Hey, you can't come in here!

1261
01:42:43,117 --> 01:42:46,371
Each set of drones
is communicating in its own unique language.

1262
01:42:46,372 --> 01:42:50,340
- Choose one and focus on that.
- Have you tried Russian? Why don't you try Russian.

1263
01:43:40,110 --> 01:43:41,491
I got 'em!

1264
01:43:56,214 --> 01:43:57,888
- Rhodey, you're still locked on? - Yeah.

1265
01:43:58,134 --> 01:44:02,143
Drop your socks and grab your
crocs, we're about to get wet on this ride.

1266
01:44:03,976 --> 01:44:05,648
Wait, wait!

1267
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:25,925
He's gone!

1268
01:44:30,594 --> 01:44:33,060
Sorry buddy, had
to thin out the herd.

1269
01:44:33,202 --> 01:44:34,833
What's your twenty?

1270
01:44:46,657 --> 01:44:49,582
- What are you doing?
- I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

1271
01:44:56,128 --> 01:44:57,217
Tony!

1272
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:14,907
Reboot complete.

1273
01:45:15,779 --> 01:45:19,366
- You got your best friend back.
- Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.

1274
01:45:19,367 --> 01:45:24,795
Well done with the new chest-piece. I'm reading significantly
higher output and your vitals all look promising.

1275
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,839
Yes, for the moment I'm not dying. Thank you.

1276
01:45:27,837 --> 01:45:30,271
- What do you mean you're not dying? Did you say you're dying?
- That you?

1277
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:32,138
No, I'm not. Not anymore.

1278
01:45:32,343 --> 01:45:34,553
- What's going on?
- I was going to tell you. I didn't want to..

1279
01:45:34,555 --> 01:45:37,640
- You're gonna tell me you really were dying?
- You didn't let me.

1280
01:45:37,642 --> 01:45:41,438
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you!

1281
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:44,879
Hey, hey, save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

1282
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,360
Looks like the fight's coming to you.

1283
01:45:46,361 --> 01:45:48,112
- Great. Pepper?
- Are you okay now?

1284
01:45:48,113 --> 01:45:50,992
- I'm fine. Don't be mad. I will formally...
- I am mad.

1285
01:45:50,993 --> 01:45:53,875
...apologize when I'm not fending off a Hammeroid attack!

1286
01:45:54,789 --> 01:45:56,922
- We could've been in Venice.
- Oh, please...

1287
01:45:59,379 --> 01:46:00,718
Rhodes!

1288
01:46:01,381 --> 01:46:03,097
Snap out of it, buddy!
I need you.

1289
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,476
They're coming. Come on let's roll. Get up.

1290
01:46:10,436 --> 01:46:12,400
Oh man, you can have your suit back.

1291
01:46:16,025 --> 01:46:18,659
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

1292
01:46:20,824 --> 01:46:23,848
- Tony, look... I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

1293
01:46:23,849 --> 01:46:26,127
- No I should've trusted you more.
- I'm the one who put you in this position. Forget it.

1294
01:46:26,582 --> 01:46:28,604
No it's your fault. I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

1295
01:46:28,605 --> 01:46:31,593
Thank you.
That's all I want to hear, partner.

1296
01:46:32,173 --> 01:46:35,472
They're coming in hot. Any
second. What's the play?

1297
01:46:36,511 --> 01:46:39,118
Well we wanna take the high ground, okay.
So let's take

1298
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:42,247
the biggest gun up on that ridge. - Got you.

1299
01:46:42,248 --> 01:46:44,355
- Where do you wanna be?
- Where you going? - What are you talking about?

1300
01:46:44,356 --> 01:46:46,733
- I mean me.
- I have a big gun, you are not the big gun.

1301
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:49,189
- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No it's subtle with all the bells and whistles.

1302
01:46:49,190 --> 01:46:51,661
- It's called being a bad ass.
- Fine.

1303
01:46:52,909 --> 01:46:56,845
- Alright. You go up top. I'll draw 'em in.
- But don't stay down here

1304
01:46:56,872 --> 01:46:58,535
it's the worst place to be.

1305
01:46:58,541 --> 01:47:02,696
- Okay you got a spot. Where's mine?
- It's the kill box, Tony, okay, this is where you go to die.

1306
01:47:52,487 --> 01:47:54,077
- See that?
- Yea, yea, nice.

1307
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:02,798
Rhodey...

1308
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:05,467
Get down!

1309
01:48:16,437 --> 01:48:18,938
Wow. I think you should lead with that
next time.

1310
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:22,741
Yeah, sorry boss, I can only use it once.
It's a one-off.

1311
01:48:24,697 --> 01:48:26,495
I told you that five minutes ago.

1312
01:48:28,118 --> 01:48:29,708
That's your guy here.

1313
01:48:30,914 --> 01:48:32,587
- Excuse me?
- Sir, you're placed under arrest.

1314
01:48:32,875 --> 01:48:34,417
Hands behind your back, sir.

1315
01:48:34,418 --> 01:48:35,799
I'm trying to help here.

1316
01:48:40,176 --> 01:48:43,769
I get it. I see what you're doing. Trying
to pin this on me, huh?

1317
01:48:44,015 --> 01:48:48,347
That's good. You start to think like a CEO.
Taking out the competition.

1318
01:48:48,348 --> 01:48:51,628
I like that.
You think you're making a problem for me?

1319
01:48:51,629 --> 01:48:54,825
I'm gonna make a problem for you.
I'm gonna be seeing you again, real soon.

1320
01:48:59,702 --> 01:49:03,628
When they get here, I think you should station them
at the Southeast and both West exits.

1321
01:49:04,166 --> 01:49:06,001
We shut down the seven train in and out of
Willets Point already.

1322
01:49:06,002 --> 01:49:09,135
Well, have city buses there to ferry people
to operating lines.

1323
01:49:09,548 --> 01:49:10,966
You coming with us?

1324
01:49:10,967 --> 01:49:12,891
No, I'm gonna stay until the park is clear.

1325
01:49:15,932 --> 01:49:20,171
Heads up you got one more drone incoming.
This one looks different.

1326
01:49:20,522 --> 01:49:22,820
Repulsor signature
is significantly higher.

1327
01:49:33,748 --> 01:49:35,337
Good to be back.

1328
01:49:36,334 --> 01:49:37,715
This ain't gonna be good.

1329
01:49:41,091 --> 01:49:45,308
I got something special for this guy.
I'm gonna bust his bunker with the ex-wife.

1330
01:49:45,471 --> 01:49:46,603
The what?

1331
01:49:57,487 --> 01:49:59,786
- Hammer tech?
- Yeah.

1332
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:02,832
We got this.

1333
01:50:56,065 --> 01:50:57,906
Rhodes! I got an idea.

1334
01:50:58,830 --> 01:51:00,654
You wanna be a hero?

1335
01:51:00,655 --> 01:51:03,408
- What?
- I can really use a sidekick.

1336
01:51:03,409 --> 01:51:06,323
- Put your hand up.
- This is your idea?

1337
01:51:06,324 --> 01:51:09,879
- Yup.
- I'm ready, I'm ready, go go go.

1338
01:51:13,672 --> 01:51:15,303
Hit him!

1339
01:51:43,003 --> 01:51:44,884
You lose.

1340
01:51:52,119 --> 01:51:54,877
All these drones are rigged to blow
We gotta get out of here man.

1341
01:51:55,248 --> 01:51:56,796
Pepper?

1342
01:52:36,470 --> 01:52:38,513
Oh my god, I can't take this anymore!

1343
01:52:38,514 --> 01:52:39,681
- You can't?
- I can't take this.

1344
01:52:39,682 --> 01:52:41,037
What do you mean, look at me!

1345
01:52:41,038 --> 01:52:45,183
My body literally cannot handle the stress.
I never know if you're gonna kill yourself...

1346
01:52:45,185 --> 01:52:47,149
or wreck the whole company...

1347
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:49,450
I think I did okay!

1348
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:51,739
I quit.
I'm resigning.

1349
01:52:52,053 --> 01:52:54,096
That's it.

1350
01:52:54,097 --> 01:52:57,226
What did you just say?
You're done?

1351
01:52:57,540 --> 01:52:59,791
Surprising, I mean not
surprising.

1352
01:52:59,792 --> 01:53:03,714
I get it.
You don't have to make any excuses.

1353
01:53:03,715 --> 01:53:06,092
- I'm not making any excuses.
- Well you actually were just making excuses.

1354
01:53:06,093 --> 01:53:09,644
I wasn't making an excuse but I'm actually very justified.

1355
01:53:09,744 --> 01:53:11,521
You deserve better.

1356
01:53:12,184 --> 01:53:14,316
You've taken such good care of me.

1357
01:53:15,521 --> 01:53:17,758
I've been in tough spot
you got me through it, so.

1358
01:53:17,817 --> 01:53:20,027
- Right?
- Thank you.

1359
01:53:20,028 --> 01:53:23,407
- Yeah.
- Thank you for understanding.

1360
01:53:23,408 --> 01:53:25,925
- Let's start clean up.
- I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.

1361
01:53:25,926 --> 01:53:28,496
What about the press?
Because you only had the job for a week. That's gonna be...

1362
01:53:28,497 --> 01:53:31,548
- With you it's like dog years.
- I know.

1363
01:53:31,835 --> 01:53:33,216
I mean it's like the President.

1364
01:53:45,228 --> 01:53:46,776
Weird.

1365
01:53:46,793 --> 01:53:48,028
No it's not weird.

1366
01:53:48,086 --> 01:53:50,671
- It's okay, right?
- Yeah.

1367
01:53:50,672 --> 01:53:53,321
I think it was weird.

1368
01:53:53,322 --> 01:53:56,721
You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.

1369
01:53:56,722 --> 01:54:00,310
- I had just quit
- You don't have to do that.

1370
01:54:00,311 --> 01:54:01,931
- I heard the whole thing.
- You should get lost.

1371
01:54:01,933 --> 01:54:04,440
I was here first.
Get a roof.

1372
01:54:04,441 --> 01:54:07,569
- I thought you were out of one-liners?
- That's the last one.

1373
01:54:07,570 --> 01:54:10,244
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You too.

1374
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:13,390
Listen, my car got taken out in the explosions

1375
01:54:13,391 --> 01:54:16,519
so I'm gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?

1376
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,792
Not okay with thats.

1377
01:54:18,793 --> 01:54:22,970
It wasn't a question.

1378
01:54:27,451 --> 01:54:29,228
I don't understand...

1379
01:54:48,458 --> 01:54:51,252
I don't think I want you looking at that.

1380
01:54:51,253 --> 01:54:53,927
I'm not sure it pertains to you anymore.

1381
01:54:54,069 --> 01:55:00,082
Now this, on the other hand, is agent
Romanoff's assessment of you.

1382
01:55:00,369 --> 01:55:02,731
Read it.

1383
01:55:02,873 --> 01:55:07,112
Personality overview:
Mr Stark displays compulsive behavior.

1384
01:55:07,274 --> 01:55:09,970
In my own defense, that
was last week.

1385
01:55:11,822 --> 01:55:15,331
Prone to self-destructive tendencies.
I was dying.

1386
01:55:15,411 --> 01:55:18,017
I mean, please, aren't we all?

1387
01:55:18,018 --> 01:55:21,339
Textbook narcissism?

1388
01:55:22,086 --> 01:55:24,552
Agreed.

1389
01:55:26,175 --> 01:55:29,491
Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative,
Iron Man, yes.

1390
01:55:29,492 --> 01:55:32,062
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

1391
01:55:34,895 --> 01:55:38,237
Tony Stark not recommended?

1392
01:55:38,984 --> 01:55:42,868
That doesn't make any sense. How can
you approve me but not approve me?

1393
01:55:44,095 --> 01:55:49,293
I got a new ticker, I'm trying to do right
by Pepper.

1394
01:55:49,310 --> 01:55:53,043
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

1395
01:55:53,044 --> 01:55:58,347
Which leads us to believe at this juncture
we'd only like to use you as a consultant.

1396
01:56:04,435 --> 01:56:07,234
You can't afford me.

1397
01:56:09,441 --> 01:56:12,361
Then again I will waive my customary retainer

1398
01:56:12,362 --> 01:56:14,994
in exchange for a small favor.

1399
01:56:15,928 --> 01:56:18,536
Rhodey and I are being honored in Washington

1400
01:56:18,537 --> 01:56:21,086
and we need a presenter.

1401
01:56:22,729 --> 01:56:24,277
I'll see what I can do.

1402
01:56:25,755 --> 01:56:27,923
It is my honor to be here today

1403
01:56:27,924 --> 01:56:32,596
to present these distinguished awards
to Lt. Col. James Rhodes

1404
01:56:32,597 --> 01:56:36,377
and Mr. Tony Stark
who is of course

1405
01:56:36,393 --> 01:56:38,900
a national treasure.

1406
01:56:40,274 --> 01:56:44,152
Thank you Lieutenant Colonel
for such an exceptionally distinguished performance.

1407
01:56:44,154 --> 01:56:47,246
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

1408
01:56:48,368 --> 01:56:53,588
Mr Stark, thank you for
such an exceptionally distinguished performance.

1409
01:56:53,709 --> 01:56:55,402
You deserve this.

1410
01:56:56,107 --> 01:56:58,678
Oh sorry.

1411
01:56:59,549 --> 01:57:03,642
Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn't it?

1412
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:05,519
Let's get a photo.
