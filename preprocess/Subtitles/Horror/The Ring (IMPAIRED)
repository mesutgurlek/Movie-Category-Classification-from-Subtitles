I hate television.

00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:35,683
You know, I heard there's

7
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:38,319
so many magnetic waves traveling
through the air

8
00:00:38,419 --> 00:00:41,722
because of TV and telephones,
that we're losing, like

9
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:44,859
ten times as many brain cells
as we're supposed to.

10
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:47,661
Like, all the molecules
in our heads are all unstable.

11
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:49,263
All the companies know
about it

12
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:51,098
but they're not
doing anything about it.

13
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:53,768
It's, like, a big conspiracy.

You can pick something.

You have any idea

I got a better one.

20
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:09,116
Have you heard about
this videotape

21
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:10,979
that kills you
when you watch it?

22
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:12,653
What kind of tape?

23
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:14,922
A tape, a regular tape.

24
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:16,290
People rent it, I don't know.

25
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,625
You start to play it

26
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:20,394
and it's, like,
somebody's nightmare.

27
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:23,864
Then suddenly,
this woman comes on

28
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:26,167
smiling at you, right?

29
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:29,403
Seeing you through the screen...

00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:32,139
and as soon as
it's over...

31

your phone rings.

32

Someone knows
you've watched it

33
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:39,647
and what they say is...

34
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:43,012
"You will die
in seven days"

35
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,018
and exactly seven
days later...

36
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:47,454
Who told you that?

37
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:49,256
Somebody from Revere.
I don't...

38
00:01:49,356 --> 00:01:50,591
Who told you?

39

What's your problem?

40
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:55,930

[ sighing ]:
It's a story, Katie.

42
00:01:58,198 --> 00:01:59,967
No, me and Josh,
we saw it last weekend.

43
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:01,135
I thought you were
with your parents.

44
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:02,303
I wanted to tell you.

45
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:03,470
You were with
Josh all weekend?

46
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,139
Some of his friends
got this-this place

47
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,140
up in the mountains.

48
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,175
They were trying
to record a football game.

49
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,844
I guess the reception
was so bad...

50
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:10,878
What are you talking about?

51
00:02:10,978 --> 00:02:11,879
Listen to me!

52
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:14,281
When we played the tape,
the game wasn't there.

53
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:17,051
It was...

54
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:18,719
What?

55
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,354
Wh-What was it?

56
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:23,446
It was something else.

57
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:29,663
We thought it was
some kind of sick joke...

58
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:31,890
and then the phone rang.

59

about her death?

Well, like you said, he's
not the talkative type.

That doesn't mean
he has nothing to say.

He knows I'm there.

Yes, I'm sure he does

they put on the tape
whenever it's recorded

that I don't read
Video Geek Magazine?

00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:56,780
Okay, when you record a tape

485
00:33:56,882 --> 00:33:59,184
the makeup of the tracks
is like a signature

486
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:00,953
for whatever did the recording

487
00:34:01,053 --> 00:34:03,355
like a camcorder,
VCR, whatever.

488
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:06,058
So the control track could
tell us where it came from.

I mean, that's like being born
without fingerprints.

491

Then, how did this get recorded?

just the tracking.

something happens

and she takes
this hard corner

I was hoping you had

So, what is it
you're writing, miss?

898
01:02:35,866 --> 01:02:36,900
About horses in general

or just those that go strange?

900

I read you had
to put so many down.

901

They drowned.

How'd they get out?

904
01:02:45,409 --> 01:02:46,643
They just broke

905
01:02:46,743 --> 01:02:49,713
through the fences
and ran to the shore.

906

So, they went crazy?

907
01:02:51,415 --> 01:02:53,508
It would seem so, yes...

908
01:02:53,617 --> 01:02:56,882
or maybe they just sense things
before we do.

Not today.

No.
