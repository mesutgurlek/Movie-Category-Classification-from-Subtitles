1
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,446
Please, help. Somebody, help.

2
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,734
- Miss Flores.
- Professor Cale.

3
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,320
Come on in. When did you get in?

4
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,281
A couple of days ago.
I've been talking to some guides...

5
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,992
...hoping they might know the whereabouts our tribe.

6
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,244
Any luck?

7
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,332
Well, Looks like there's sufficient evidence to suspect
these people are out there...

8
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,083
...can be found and studied.

9
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,669
At least, that's what I told the grant people.

10
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,805
My man seems to think that the tribe was somewhere around here...

11
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:43,675
...between these two tributaries.
He'd found one of their markers.

12
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:48,388
- Well, that's good.
- Yep, I think we may have a chance.

13
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,432
Well you get me there and I'll shoot it.

14
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,968
I'm counting on that.
That's why I hired you.

15
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:55,103
And I'm glad you did.
I really appreciate it.

16
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,398
Well, I wanted the best director I could get.

17
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,525
I think we'll make a good team.

18
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,696
You're a mess.
What happened to you?

19
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:09,751
Oh, just a small attack of piranha.
Barely escaped with my life.

20
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,971
Somebody's up awfully early.

21
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,474
Yeah, well, today's a good day.

22
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,303
- Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.

23
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:40,315
Not every day my homegirl from SC get to direct her own documentary.

24
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,983
You ready?

25
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,654
- I think so.
- That's right.

26
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,493
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. - Mateo?

27
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,246
I see you made this a pleasure cruise.

28
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,415
Come on, you know me.

29
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,668
I don't mix business with pleasure.

30
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,338
Okay, well, what about if we go up through here?

31
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:09,761
This way better.
If not, I cannot be responsible.

32
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,140
Okay, well, it's only 55 kilometres out of the way.

33
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,268
Shouldn't be a problem.
Better safe than sorry.

34
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,686
- Morning.
- Morning.

35
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,722
- Mateo, you understand me?
- Sure, I understand.

36
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,151
Great. I'm gonna need you to drift through that channel over there.
I wanna get some shots.

37
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,404
As you say, chefe.

38
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,823
- For your approval.
- Thanks.

39
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,193
So where's Westridge?
I know he checked in.

40
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,703
He's probably just catching up on his beauty sleep.

41
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,538
Careful!

42
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:42,461
Careful! Bordeaux. Fragile.
Expensive wine.

43
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,629
Christ!

44
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,216
- Morning.
- Morning. How was your flight?

45
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:52,053
Actually, it was a bloody nightmare.
Ongoing, I think.

46
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,016
One zoom lens.

47
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,710
You. Stow this in my room, will you?

48
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:02,430
Excuse me? I'm not the bellhop, I'm the production manager.

49
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:05,525
Then surely you can manage my things into my room.

50
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,921
- One pompous ass.
- No. In some cultures, that's a sign of friend and respect...

51
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:13,234
...when somebody asks you to carry their bags.

52
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,987
- Respect this, sound man.
- It's not me who said that.

53
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,623
- Mr. Westridge, Terri Flores.
- Terri, this is a pleasure.

54
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,791
Professor Cale lent me some of your films.

55
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,586
I thought they were very promising.

56
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,339
- God, it's hot. Are we on the equator?
- Well, thanks.

57
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,674
Welcome aboard, I guess.

58
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,011
- I think he likes you.
- Oh, you felt that too?

59
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:38,141
Damn, Cale, you look like a little low-budget-ass Jacques Cousteau.

60
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,772
Yeah, well, whatever the hell that means.

61
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,232
It's good to see you, man.

62
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,109
Chefe, ready for Rio Negro.

63
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:52,280
All right everybody.
Double check your gear, make sure it's all onboard...

64
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,116
...and pray you didn't forget your bug spray.

65
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,972
Our adventure begins 1000 miles from the mouth of the mighty Amazon...

66
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,391
...deep in the heart of the rain forest.

67
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,560
From here, we will travel by river barge...

68
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,729
...up through shallow tributaries and unexplored backwaters...

69
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:29,276
...in search of the elusive people of the mist: The Shirishama tribe.

70
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:33,154
One of the last great mysteries of the rain forest.

71
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,843
Is it just me or does the jungle make you really, really horny?

72
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,930
Oh, no. I think it's the jungle.

73
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,183
I'm serious.
I've got, like, one thing on my mind.

74
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,270
Can I work, please?

75
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,662
Help!

76
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,210
Save me! I'm stranded.

77
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,505
My boat is stranded in the roots.

78
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,549
Help me!

79
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,845
Help me! Hello!

80
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,389
Check it out, there's a dude on a boat over there.

81
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,142
Hey! Pull over to his boat.

82
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,687
Stop.

83
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,066
We'll bring you onboard.

84
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,819
Here.

85
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,078
Thank the Lord for you.
Thank the Lord.

86
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,914
You hurt?

87
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,540
Are you okay?

88
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:11,252
My propeller tore off in the roots.

89
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,674
We can't take you back to Manaus.
We're headed upriver.

90
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:21,221
At the next village, I know the people.
They help me fix my boat.

91
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:26,226
- I sorry if I be trouble for you.
- There's no need to apologise.

92
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,020
We're all at the mercy of our machines.

93
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,605
Your's broke.

94
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,192
Mateo?

95
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,635
Fish, river-style.

96
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,971
Not bad.

97
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,807
We're gonna have to get that on film next time.

98
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,817
- Ever work in a sushi bar, Mr?
- Serone. Paul Serone.

99
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,652
Where you from, Mr. Serone?

100
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,114
- Paraguay.
- Really?

101
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,284
I started out studying for the priesthood...

102
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:28,788
...but then I needed to see the real world.

103
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,166
So I ended up in the jungle.

104
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:32,959
I seem to fit.

105
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,629
Tell me, what does a failed priest do in the jungle?

106
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,048
Fail?

107
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,050
Who says I fail?

108
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:42,677
I didn't fail.

109
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,640
- I'm sure you didn't.
- Well, what is your calling now?

110
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,685
- Snakes.
- Snakes?

111
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,645
I catch them.

112
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,107
For zoos and collectors.
Whatever they want.

113
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,776
Poaching?

114
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,656
Poaching is illegal.
May I ask what you are hunting?

115
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,534
We are not hunting or trapping anything.

116
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:11,581
We're making a documentary on the Shirishama Indians.

117
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,002
- The People of the Mist?
- That's right. You've heard of them?

118
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,921
I've seen them.

119
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,883
Really?
You think you could show me where that was?

120
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,387
You people saved my life.
This I can do.

121
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,682
I can show you exactly where I saw the Shirishama.

122
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:34,687
So slurs every other river rat after
five whiskies in any bar in Manaus.

123
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,064
Come on, lovey.

124
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,816
Five whiskies?

125
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,902
That's breakfast on the river.

126
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:48,743
Well, does salad go well with fish river-style, Mr. Serone?

127
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:53,248
Salad would be perfect little baby bird.

128
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,603
Okay.

129
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,522
Look at that.

130
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,112
What are those, fireflies?

131
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,241
It's pretty, huh?

132
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,036
Family Lampyridae.

133
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,473
On certain nights they all gather in the same tree and use their...

134
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:38,877
...night flashes to announce their readiness to mate.

135
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,715
Well, whose flashes, the males or females?

136
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,717
Both, actually.

137
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:51,804
The females with a series of short,
dainty feminine little flashes about eight per second.

138
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:56,269
The males respond with a series of long, drawn-out manly flashes.

139
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,316
I like that.

140
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:05,320
No pick-up lines, no misunderstandings.

141
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,822
Just instinct and nature.

142
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,998
I've missed you.

143
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,974
Shit.

144
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,067
Bloody racket.

145
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:32,657
Hey, hey, hey! Don't touch my radio.

146
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,210
You know, I could cheerfully hire someone to kill you.

147
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:48,089
A local tribesman, perhaps.
Fifteen dollars should cover it.

148
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,759
- I could just kill you for free right now.
- Oh, yeah?

149
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,597
- You and whose army?
- Your mama's.

150
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,145
So are we getting close?

151
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,690
Just around this bend.

152
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,359
Perfect.

153
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,716
A snake totem.

154
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,888
This totem is Shirishama.

155
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:42,892
Shirishama worship giant snakes, anacondas as gods, protectors.

156
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:47,398
There's a legend they pass down of a journey to a sacred lake.

157
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,818
First you must pass a waterfall protected by warrior snakes.

158
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,321
Once you pass those guardians...

159
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,865
...you travel through the land of the Shirishama...

160
00:17:56,033 --> 00:18:00,880
...until you come to a wall so high, it blots out the sky...

161
00:18:00,888 --> 00:18:06,490
Follow that wall for five days,
finally reaching its end the head of a giant anaconda.

162
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,422
- You know the story.
- Of course.

163
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,549
Beautiful, beautiful legend.

164
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,844
I believe, however, it's a legend of the Maku.

165
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,597
Also the Shirishama.

166
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,140
Not to my knowledge.

167
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,477
The water is high now, but the village was right here.

168
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:30,191
You'll find them down this fork.
I know, I trap snakes for a living.

169
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,485
And I'm sure you're very good at it.

170
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,364
I locate tribes for a living and I'm very good at that.

171
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,326
The water level is high, which by my calculations means...

172
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,495
...the areas to this side will be flooded...

173
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,206
...which would force our tribe, if they wanted to eat...

174
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,875
...to seek out higher ground.
So over here.

175
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,795
Which way?

176
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,256
We'll go this way.

177
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:58,888
Westridge, I wanna get a shot of you with the totem.
And, Gary, you're gonna roll sound.

178
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,665
- Camera rolling.
- Action.

179
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:08,104
Our first piece of luck: A Shirishama idol
although this is the subject of some dispute.

180
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,439
I know what I know.
You can accept it or reject it.

181
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,234
- Leave me at the next village.
- Cut.

182
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,486
With pleasure.

183
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,865
What the hell was that all about?

184
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,850
We're gonna go out and get some wild sound.

185
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,351
Well, just be careful.

186
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,020
We will.

187
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,480
See you guys.

188
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,191
All right.

189
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,333
Gary...

190
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,567
It's unbelievable.

191
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,491
- Gary?
- What?

192
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,749
Oh, my God.

193
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,689
No, wait.

194
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,775
Do you hear that?

195
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,321
The silence.

196
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,077
Run, Gary!

197
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,849
- What was that?
- I don't know.

198
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,231
Mateo, shine the light over there.

199
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,495
These two are fortunate to be alive.

200
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,408
- What happened?
- You guys okay?

201
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,119
Man, you should have seen it.
What a shot.

202
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,338
This guy just blasted this thing coming right at us.

203
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,135
Wild boar.

204
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,264
Gores with his tusks.
Goes for the eyes.

205
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:34,727
- Denise, are you okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

206
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,855
From now on, everybody stays onboard at night, all right?

207
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,108
- No exceptions.
- That's a smart idea.

208
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,241
Mateo, let's cut him up.
Food for a week.

209
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,912
Food?

210
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,139
- My turn?
- No, it's my turn.

211
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,732
- No, it isn't.
- Yeah, it is.

212
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,498
Mateo, do you have control of this vessel?

213
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,083
Lie, if you must.

214
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,503
Mateo.

215
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,797
Goddamn rope's caught in the propeller.

216
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,475
Well, looks like I'm gonna have to cut us loose.

217
00:23:56,643 --> 00:24:01,021
It's maybe better I do it.
This river can kill you in 1000 ways.

218
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,967
I can handle it.
The only thing I'm really afraid of...

219
00:24:04,974 --> 00:24:06,562
- Okay.
- ...is the candiru acu.

220
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,028
Can do what?

221
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,490
Candiru acu. It's a tiny little catfish.

222
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:15,953
It swims up into your urethra, finds a nice warm spot...

223
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,416
...spreads its thorny little spines and refuses to budge.

224
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,877
You have to cut it out.

225
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,422
That's it, man.
I'm getting the hell back to L.A.

226
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,955
Terri, something's wrong!

227
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,541
Oh, my God.

228
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,376
Cale?

229
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,506
- He's hurt. I'm going.
- Hold up, hold on. Hold it, I got it.

230
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,174
Gary.

231
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:54,927
Hurry up.

232
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,513
Come on, guys. Come on.

233
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,682
Steven? Oh, my God.

234
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,267
Is he breathing?

235
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,895
Faster, come on.
Is he all right? Is he okay?

236
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,816
- Hurry.
- Oh, my God.

237
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,235
- Dan, be careful.
- What is it?

238
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,153
- It's okay.
- What is it?

239
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,491
Take his mask off.
Be careful, be careful.

240
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,326
- Get something for his head.
- Okay.

241
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,620
- He's not breathing.
- Move him.

242
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,080
He's not breathing.

243
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,832
- Something for his head.
- Here.

244
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,834
There's something in the mouth.

245
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,003
Oh, dear God.

246
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,006
Oh, damn. What's that?

247
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,674
Oh, God.

248
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,426
A wasp.

249
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,344
Deadly.

250
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,055
Poisonous.

251
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,851
Well, he's still not breathing.
What are we gonna do?

252
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:49,565
- Oh, God. How did this happen?
- Alcohol.

253
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,235
I've got whisky in my flask.

254
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:01,201
- Quickly.
- What's that for? What are you... - ?

255
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:15,883
- He's breathing. He's breathing.
- That's it. He's gonna be all right.

256
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,971
Here.

257
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,448
He seems okay. We should go now.

258
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:43,535
Man, that radio don't work.
We have no communication.

259
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,080
Hey, I can't fix, okay?

260
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,166
- We can start now.
- No, no, no.

261
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,501
Fog.

262
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,212
We don't get this man to a hospital soon...

263
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,964
...we might as well throw him in the river.

264
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,424
What?

265
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,677
Terri, we got lights.

266
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:05,641
Good. Mateo, we're just gonna double back.

267
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,604
Fighting the current, lose two days.

268
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:15,943
Cut back to this tributary, save us 50 miles.

269
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,116
This is the route you suggested we take yesterday.

270
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,535
Yesterday for a different reason.

271
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,788
Now our concern is getting Professor Cale to a hospital...

272
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,456
...as fast as possible.

273
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,750
Fine.

274
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,546
I hope you know what you're doing...

275
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,881
...because I don't know about this dude.

276
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,635
What choice do I have?

277
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,143
What the hell is this?

278
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,353
Hey, Terri, come here.

279
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,280
This is the river you know?

280
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,825
No, this is new.

281
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,662
But no cause for panic.

282
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,371
I'm not panicking, I'm just looking at this wall...

283
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,547
...that's blocking our way down this river that you know.

284
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,634
Well, let's just see what we can do.

285
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,511
Hey, is that real dynamite?

286
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,389
- It's always good to be prepared.
- Prepared for what?

287
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:13,560
Well, you gotta be kidding me.
That thing must be there for a reason.

288
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,813
Yeah, to keep us out.

289
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,650
I'm talking about upsetting the ecological balance of this river.

290
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,396
Well, look, I can blow it in 10 minutes...

291
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:26,108
...or if you feeling sensitive, we can turn around and lose two days.

292
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,116
It's up to you.

293
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,665
Terri?

294
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:40,462
Oh, for God's sake, blow the bloody thing.

295
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:46,009
Just give me 10 minutes, people.
Ten minutes.

296
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:51,181
I'm gonna need some help.
Gary, get the little boat.

297
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,939
- There's something down there.
- That's right.

298
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,942
- No, I really mean it.
- I really mean it too.

299
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,325
Hurry!

300
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,276
Shit.

301
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,820
Goddamn it. These snakes.

302
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,366
Oh, God.

303
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,535
Babies. All of them babies.

304
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,704
Well, how do we get them off the boat?

305
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:41,875
Come on, babies.
Come on, back to your mama. Come on.

306
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,711
Come on.

307
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,964
Some of these aren't babies.

308
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,676
Mateo, there's more right here.

309
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,511
Calm.

310
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:58,183
- You little shit.
- Serone, help him get it off.

311
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,479
Someone get this bloody thing off my freaking hand!

312
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,231
Get it off!

313
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,360
So young and yet so lethal.

314
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:12,322
Get it off me. Come on.

315
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,413
Later, sweetie.

316
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,000
You knew there were snakes here, didn't you, Serone?

317
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,127
It was a pleasant surprise.

318
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,545
What about the fuel?

319
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,255
There's only one drum left.

320
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,057
That's enough for about 100 kilometres.

321
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:34,761
About a day's ride.
Well, that will have to do.

322
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,764
Go, go. Back to your mother.

323
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,279
Hey.

324
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,740
Hi.

325
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,616
How's he doing?

326
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,912
- He's breathing normally now.
- That's good.

327
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,373
We'll get him home.

328
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,961
I just don't know what's going on, you know?

329
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,425
Serone's supposed to help us get back to the hospital, right?

330
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,095
And he acts like he owns this river.

331
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,725
And we run into a barrier full of snakes.
s

332
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:24,644
I mean, where is he taking us?

333
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,928
Mateo. Mateo! Stop the boat.

334
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:05,602
- Stop it.
- Why are we stopping now?

335
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,897
Could be fuel.

336
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,861
You know that boat?

337
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,031
There's lots of boats like that.

338
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,453
Hello?

339
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,637
I get the distinct impression there's nobody home.

340
00:35:32,645 --> 00:35:33,880
Mateo?

341
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,216
Come with me.

342
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,387
Hold up.

343
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,557
I'm gonna get this on film.

344
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,561
- You don't need sound, do you?
- No, I'm not gonna go over there.

345
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,551
Go aft.

346
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,170
Serone?

347
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,683
- Kind of spooky in here.
- You think so?

348
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,322
What the?

349
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,734
Goddamn.

350
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,264
- Help me with this.
- What's that?

351
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,617
Treasures.

352
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,462
Here.

353
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,635
Hey, be careful.
I put my camera in here.

354
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,566
Mateo, that's it. Let's go.

355
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,028
Hey, I'm coming. I'm coming.

356
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,889
What's all this?
And what about the fuel?

357
00:40:01,897 --> 00:40:03,149
There wasn't no fuel.

358
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,651
- Great.
- Where's Mateo?

359
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,947
I don't know.
He was right behind us.

360
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,283
Mateo!

361
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,719
- I'm going back.
- Serone, go with him.

362
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,297
Maybe some other time.

363
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,509
Asshole.

364
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,769
Stuck in the middle of nowhere and now we've lost the driver.

365
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,980
Mateo.

366
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,447
Come on, man. Stop playing.

367
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,726
Danny?

368
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,980
Danny!

369
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,987
Danny?

370
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,574
- Yeah.
- You okay?

371
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,326
I'm all right.

372
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,203
I didn't see him.

373
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,456
How very reassuring.

374
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,250
Here, this is it.

375
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,253
- This is all you found?
- Yeah.

376
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,511
- What the hell is this?
- Anaconda skin.

377
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,766
- There's snakes out there this big?
- This skin is three or four years old.

378
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,935
Whatever's shed it has grown since then.

379
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:06,305
But something like this has made a meal of our dear captain.

380
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:07,774
What?

381
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:12,820
- Snakes don't eat people.
- Oh, they don't?

382
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,117
Anacondas are a perfect killing machine.

383
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,619
They have heat sensors.

384
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:24,749
A warm body like Mateo's in the water wasn't hard to find.

385
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:30,463
They strike, wrap around you, hold you tighter than your true love.

386
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:34,041
And you get the privilege of hearing your bones break...

387
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:38,221
...before your power of the embrace causes yours veins to explode.

388
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:43,309
- No, Mateo's probably just lost.
- Oh, wake up.

389
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,397
Imagine something this big, captured alive.

390
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,066
That's worth a lot of money, Gary.

391
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,901
Jesus.

392
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,487
Please, people...

393
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,490
...don't make me out a monster.

394
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,827
I didn't eat the captain Mateo.

395
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,913
Come on, everybody.

396
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,966
We are not sure that Mateo is dead.

397
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,420
- So we'll just wait here till morning.
- Are you insane?

398
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,548
Where do you think he went, a walk in the woods?

399
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,977
Now listen. We've got to get the hell out of here.

400
00:43:15,984 --> 00:43:18,428
- Oh, get a grip, Westridge.
- I've got a grip.

401
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,556
We are not leaving.
If it was you out there, you'd want us to stay too.

402
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:26,269
Listen, if it was me out there, I'd be dead, don't you see?

403
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:30,690
Just go into your cabin and lock the door.

404
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,819
Like a bad boy. All right. All right.

405
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,113
Where are my shoes?
Where are my shoes?

406
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:42,243
- We're gonna aim some lights at the boat.
- That's a good idea.

407
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,412
Lights are a good idea.

408
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:10,730
I'm not so sure he didn't eat the captain.

409
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,025
He sure looks satiated.

410
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,199
Think he's still alive?

411
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,579
- No. Let's go to bed.
- Okay.

412
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,708
Danger.

413
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:35,755
Danger is exciting, huh, Gary?

414
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,549
You go on to the bed, I'm gonna catch up to you.

415
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,879
- Gary, come on.
- I'm just gonna talk to him for a second. Then I'll catch up to you.

416
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:45,047
- Well, hurry up, I'm scared.
- I'll be right there.

417
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:59,278
- So it's out there, isn't it?
- Yeah.

418
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:03,700
- And you know how to catch these things, right?
- That's right.

419
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:09,628
But you can't catch an anaconda by yourself.
You need a partner.

420
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:15,333
Capture alive maybe a million dollars, Gary.

421
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,459
Still no Mateo.

422
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,380
Keep it steady, Westridge.

423
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,716
Steady it.

424
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,394
Man, what the fuck are you doing?

425
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,855
You can't catch anacondas without bait.

426
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,024
Oh, my God.

427
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,743
- Westridge, let's go.
- No, Westridge. Stop. Not on my boat.

428
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,412
Your boat?
You speak for everybody?

429
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,458
Gary? She speak for everybody?

430
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,963
Gary?

431
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:27,585
Well, I mean, the way I figure it,
with Cale messed up, I mean the movie's off.

432
00:47:27,593 --> 00:47:29,395
Why not salvage something?

433
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,016
You know, let's film Serone capturing a big snake.

434
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,847
- Have you lost your mind?
- Have I lost my mind?

435
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,890
No, I haven't lost your mind.
If anything, I'm completely lucid right now.

436
00:47:40,898 --> 00:47:43,025
I think it's you guys who need to open up your eyes.

437
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,443
Yo, hold up.

438
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,146
How we go from taking Cale to the hospital...

439
00:47:47,154 --> 00:47:49,949
- ...to catching a goddamn snake?
- Do you know where you are?

440
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,009
You're in the middle of the jungle.

441
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:55,388
Okay, all you guys do is you question and you criticise...

442
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:58,701
...but just remember,
you don't know shit about the shit we're in out here.

443
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,726
And neither do I, okay?

444
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:04,563
But I guarantee you I know who does: This guy.

445
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,549
Paul has been here.

446
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,295
And if we help him catch the snake...

447
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,570
...then he will help us get out of here alive.

448
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:15,408
And that, amigos, is not insanity.
That is common freaking sense.

449
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,770
Come on, Gary, this... this isn't you.

450
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,706
- Honey, what did he do to you?
- Stop, okay? Stop.

451
00:48:22,714 --> 00:48:24,783
Think about how much money this will be worth.

452
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:31,248
Imagine capturing something like this on film for the first time ever.

453
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:36,053
- Let's be honest. What else are we supposed to do?
- I know what I'm gonna do.

454
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:40,391
I'm about to throw both of you son of bitches in the river myself.

455
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:48,024
- I don't think so.
- I didn't want this to happen, people.

456
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:51,969
- Let's go, Westridge.
- Okay.

457
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,722
Gary.

458
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:59,685
Occupy yourselves.
Play some cards.

459
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,937
Nobody move.

460
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,944
Gary! Gary, get the lights.

461
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,199
Westridge, stop the boat. Stop it.

462
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:21,260
- Get it over here, Westridge.
- You're gonna get us all killed.

463
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,079
That's it, that's it.

464
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,039
Go for the eyes.

465
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,750
- Go for the eyes. Blind it.
- Oh, man.

466
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,395
He's fishing for snakes.
The man gotta be crazy.

467
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:32,831
Just let it go.

468
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,008
Westridge, come here.
Come down here.

469
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,689
Danny!

470
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,692
Westridge.

471
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:07,248
Where is it?
Where is it?

472
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:31,413
Don't move.
I'll get it with the tranquillizer.

473
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,628
Denise, get up here. Get up here.

474
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,660
Gary, help me.

475
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,599
- Get out of there.
- Grab her, man.

476
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,267
I'm stuck.

477
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,270
Grab her hand.

478
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:15,089
The snake, it's in the water!
Let's go!

479
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,811
- Gary!
- I got you.

480
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,624
Gary, give me your hand.

481
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,171
Gary!

482
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,341
- Gary!
- No!

483
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,801
It's no good to me dead.

484
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,224
Gary!

485
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,811
Oh, God! Oh, God!

486
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,023
Gary!

487
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:34,203
May the souls of the faithful departed...

488
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:38,707
...through the mercy of God rest in peace. Amen.

489
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,405
- Westridge.
- How dare you.

490
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,994
It was you who brought that snake.

491
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,662
You brought the devil.

492
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,874
There's the devil inside everyone.

493
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:59,461
- Get your hands off her.
- Horrible.

494
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,881
- Westridge!
- What?

495
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,806
Take my gear up to the pilot house.

496
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,942
I'm not your bloody poodle.

497
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,687
What you say?

498
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,398
How dare you presume to order me about?

499
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,275
Presume?

500
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:25,254
How you like I presume to throw you in the river?
You like that presume?

501
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,575
Take it upstairs.

502
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,201
Thank you.

503
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,541
Everyone else, don't move.

504
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:43,005
Get back. Get back.

505
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,064
Terri, let's talk.

506
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,985
You want something?

507
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,699
I just want to talk to you.

508
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,043
I was thinking about the myth.

509
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,215
I don't know if you know, but this...

510
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,318
This film was supposed to be my big break.

511
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,699
And it's turned out to be a big disaster.

512
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,899
Anyway, I was just thinking...

513
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,069
...that maybe I could film you...

514
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,948
...capturing the snake and then...

515
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,430
...it wouldn't have all been for nothing.

516
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,252
I don't know. It could be dangerous.

517
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:31,006
Well, I know.

518
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,780
But at least you'd be there to protect us.

519
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,266
You need protection?

520
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,770
Yeah.

521
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,900
It's been a long time...

522
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,403
...since I had a woman.

523
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,792
You think I'm stupid?

524
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,963
I'm not stupid.

525
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,462
- It worked.
- Asshole in one.

526
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,072
- Shall I hit him again to make sure?
- No. Let's throw him in the river.

527
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:23,575
- Haven't we had enough of that?
- I'm ashamed to say I enjoyed it.

528
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,836
Come on, let's just tie him up, okay?

529
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:05,142
This was all one big setup, huh?

530
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,854
Mateo, you stranded...

531
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:13,458
...the shipwrecked boat, your route to the hospital.

532
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,278
How can you forget about the wasp?

533
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,291
See, what you do is not so hard.

534
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,544
I can trap a snake too.

535
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:38,191
As smart as you are, you can't survive without me.

536
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,396
Hey, we're gonna be home soon, okay?

537
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:17,189
I can't believe how good you're doing.
Hang in there, baby.

538
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,055
Is it hard to drive?

539
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:28,074
It's a doddle, like driving a Cadillac Fleetwood.

540
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:30,952
Tell you what, I'll give you a driving lesson.

541
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,981
Right, black knobs: Up to go forward, down to go back.

542
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:38,877
Red knobs: Up to go fast, down to go slow.

543
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,630
Wheel: Four turns hard over, left and right.

544
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,591
If you get into trouble, turn off the ignition, all right?

545
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:47,703
- Take it for a spin.
- That's it?

546
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:49,705
Take us back to civilisation.

547
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:52,958
Shit, no problem.

548
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,335
Take us back to...

549
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,463
...crisp sheets and hot showers.

550
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,124
The playoffs and a six-pack.

551
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:04,736
Eighteen holds of golf and a quadruple gin and tonic.

552
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,431
L.A. Traffic and my cellular phone.

553
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:09,307
Don't start.

554
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,500
The waterfall.

555
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,503
It's a beautiful sight, baby bird.

556
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,797
The legend was right.

557
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,341
What is this place?

558
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,680
Oh, dear.

559
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:51,016
It's absolutely beautiful.

560
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,657
- What the hell was that?
- I think we hit the bottom.

561
01:02:59,665 --> 01:03:01,735
- We did.
- Hey.

562
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,905
Turn the wheel hard over left.

563
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,993
Right. Put it in reverse.

564
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,164
Shut it down.

565
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,382
Shit.

566
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,973
We got to winch ourselves loose.

567
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,059
Whoa, what are you doing?

568
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:37,746
- I mean, we have to get in the water?
- We ain't got much choice.

569
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:41,883
I figure me and you go over here, wrap a rope around that tree.

570
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,270
You, you wrap a rope around that tree.

571
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:47,005
Pull it tight.
If not, we're stuck here forever.

572
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,866
We've got to make it quick, in and out.

573
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,578
I rather hoped I'd done my bit.

574
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,327
That's our rope right there.

575
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,686
- Just enough to go around the tree, right?
- Yeah.

576
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,814
We'll take this, get it around that trunk right there.

577
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:07,551
- Make sure it's secure.
- Roger.

578
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,655
- Hate this.
- Last time I was in water like this...

579
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:15,200
...I was up all night picking leeches off my scrotum.

580
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,097
Aren't you gonna pray?

581
01:04:56,309 --> 01:05:00,286
Never look in the eyes of those you kill.

582
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,316
They will haunt you forever. I know.

583
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:20,148
I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace...

584
01:05:20,156 --> 01:05:22,918
...to confess my sins...

585
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,962
...and to amend my life. Amen.

586
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:32,552
Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus...

587
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,305
...baby bird.

588
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:44,022
Okay.

589
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,745
Hurry up.

590
01:06:17,532 --> 01:06:20,266
Shit. Back on the boat. Now.

591
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:23,444
Come on! Go.

592
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,772
Christ.

593
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,176
Get on the boat. Go on, hurry.

594
01:06:30,184 --> 01:06:31,987
- Come on. Come on.
- Quick!

595
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:36,701
- Get up.
- Hurry, it's there!

596
01:06:36,709 --> 01:06:38,042
All right. Get up!

597
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,413
Over here, you fat-assed bastard.

598
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,623
Shit.

599
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,138
- Westridge, go up the rocks.
- Go!

600
01:06:58,305 --> 01:06:59,973
Get up the rocks!

601
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,102
It's coming. Go!

602
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,957
- Go get the gun.
- What are we gonna do?

603
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,442
Go get it.

604
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:17,157
Hurry up.

605
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:18,783
Come on, man.

606
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,969
- Westridge, keep going, man.
- Danny, watch out!

607
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,454
Danny, move your arm.

608
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,589
Westridge!

609
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:21,638
Look out!

610
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,277
Danny?

611
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:39,697
Danny! Danny!

612
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:41,533
Yeah?

613
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,536
Westridge? Westridge?

614
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:47,205
Shit.

615
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,387
Come on, hurry up.

616
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:06,349
I'm caught.

617
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,063
Come on, Danny. Hurry up.

618
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,649
Come on.

619
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:22,240
Danny!

620
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:26,995
No!

621
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:30,999
Danny!

622
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,797
Danny, hold on.

623
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,386
Hold on.

624
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:04,490
Come on.

625
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:20,131
You killed my warrior snake.

626
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:26,888
Get up.

627
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,724
The dart.

628
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:39,692
The tranquillizer's working. Get him.

629
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:53,498
Damn, the dart came out his back.

630
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:57,669
Come on, almost there.

631
01:11:04,009 --> 01:11:05,551
All right.

632
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,887
Baby?

633
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,932
He's lost consciousness again.

634
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,435
I'm gonna try to get us out of here.

635
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,988
- The tree knocked us loose.
- All right.

636
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,246
Hey, Terri, look.

637
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:56,936
They might have some fuel for us.

638
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:59,063
Let's check it out.

639
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:07,613
- Need some help?
- No, I'm cool.

640
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,193
I don't even wanna know what happened here.

641
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,512
Me neither.

642
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,015
I hope they got some fuel, though.

643
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,232
Damn.

644
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:30,822
Those drums. Could be fuel.

645
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:04,522
A snake skin.

646
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:18,469
- Look, there's plenty of fuel in here.
- Welcome.

647
01:15:07,711 --> 01:15:09,253
Time to wake up.

648
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:21,766
Monkey blood.

649
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:25,202
I'm gonna kill you, Serone!
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you!

650
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,355
Don't get me upset.

651
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,613
See this?

652
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:38,115
Human bones.

653
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:40,409
That's how it comes out.

654
01:15:41,161 --> 01:15:43,287
Ashes to ashes...

655
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,473
Oh, shit.

656
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:03,975
Oh, shit. Look.

657
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:07,520
Up, on three. Come on.

658
01:16:35,799 --> 01:16:37,300
Go.

659
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,074
Gotcha.

660
01:17:59,424 --> 01:18:00,925
Come on.

661
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:05,596
Get loose.

662
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,809
Let's get the fuel and get the hell out of here.

663
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:41,257
Don't worry, just go.

664
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:44,176
Run. It's coming for you.

665
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:38,898
Danny, where are you?

666
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:44,094
- There's a whole nest up there.
- I'll have him chase me up the smokestack.

667
01:19:44,102 --> 01:19:47,840
- No, I've got the legs.
- Okay, we can trap it there.

668
01:19:47,908 --> 01:19:49,241
Okay.

669
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:52,203
Go. Go!

670
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:20,064
Hey! Can you climb up the top?

671
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:23,592
- I can use the rope.
- Hurry up, I think I can blow him up.

672
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:41,393
- I'm about to light it.
- Go ahead, I'm at the top.

673
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:50,421
- Danny!
- Okay.

674
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:51,929
Danny!

675
01:20:57,602 --> 01:21:00,454
- Get out, the fuse is lit.
- Danny, wait!

676
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,527
Push it on the side! Hit the hinges!

677
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:25,789
Hurry up! You gotta jump!

678
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:28,749
- I can't, it's too high.
- Just jump!

679
01:22:14,846 --> 01:22:16,513
I got you. Come on.

680
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:24,021
Did we get him? Did we get him?

681
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,361
We got him.

682
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:36,158
You all right?

683
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:38,410
Yeah.

684
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:41,705
We should get the fuel...

685
01:22:41,873 --> 01:22:45,350
...so we can get the hell out of here, all right?

686
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,127
Come on.

687
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,986
Come on!

688
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:16,907
Bitch.

689
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,500
Let's get out of here.

690
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:45,436
Miss Flores.

691
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,316
You're a mess.

692
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:19,219
Found another one.

693
01:24:19,637 --> 01:24:21,597
Here, let me see that.

694
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:25,309
Shirishama.

695
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:28,645
Serone was right.

696
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:32,524
Danny.

697
01:24:41,117 --> 01:24:42,659
Damn.

698
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:44,411
I'll get the camera.

699
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:45,821
I think so.

700
01:24:47,322 --> 01:24:50,622
- Right. Roll film!
- Camera rolling.
