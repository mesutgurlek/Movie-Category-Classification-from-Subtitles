Keep alive, while you
were gone so long?

338
00:36:59,188 --> 00:37:01,741
Do you know of any
other survivers?

339
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:06,701
Ok.

340

342
00:37:22,103 --> 00:37:26,249
Have you come into direct
contact with the infected?

343
00:37:36,028 --> 00:37:37,111
<i>Ok.</i>

344

Can they hear me?

351
00:38:36,135 --> 00:38:37,916
So what you 2 think
you`re planning?

352
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,345
You said you saw her die.

353
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:40,740
What?

354
00:38:41,003 --> 00:38:42,558
You said you saw her die!

355
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:46,576
I didnt said that.

356
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,517
You did. You said you saw
her die. You did.

357
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:49,864
But i didnt use those words.

358
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:54,020
This is.. i dont know..
Its confusing, you know?

359
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:56,519
Its very hard for you to
imagine you know?

360
00:38:58,221 --> 00:38:59,643
Its too hard to explain.

361
00:38:59,645 --> 00:39:01,784
Try to explain it dad!
Try!

362
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:05,820
What do you want me to say?
I thought i saw mom.. Die.

363
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:09,495
I wouldn`t have told you that.
I was sure.

364
00:39:11,978 --> 00:39:16,342
Look guys. Im not sure
whats happening here.

365
00:39:16,344 --> 00:39:21,559
But its good. Ok.
Thats the point. Mom is alive.

366
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,160
I want to see her!

367
00:39:58,745 --> 00:40:04,419
There is no question sir.
She has the virus. she`s infected.

368
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,703
Why isn`t she showing
any symptoms?

369
00:40:09,386 --> 00:40:11,400
I dont know.
- Speculate.

370
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:19,556
Genetic abnormality which access
some sort of natural immunity.

371
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,976
But the virus is still in her blood.
And its still alive.

372
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,698
Technically she is not immun.
She`s a carrier.

373
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:30,200
Are you saying she has
the ability to infect others?

374
00:40:30,203 --> 00:40:32,425
Yes sir. Absolutely.

375
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:39,725
If this woman have natural
ammunity she incredibly valuable.

Her blood can contain the key
to a vaccine even a cure.

Please forgive me.

384

time to study her.

00:56:29,393 --> 00:56:31,610
Why?
- It makes no sense.

492
00:56:31,611 --> 00:56:32,868
It makes perfect sense.

493
00:56:34,612 --> 00:56:35,709
Its "Code red".

494
00:56:48,968 --> 00:56:50,282
I saw dad.

495
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:51,742
Where?

496
00:56:53,262 --> 00:56:54,378
He is one of them.

497
00:56:56,901 --> 00:56:58,828
Step 1: Kill the infected.

498
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:02,325
Step 2: Contaminat.

499
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:05,012
If contaminat fails..

500
00:57:07,295 --> 00:57:08,403
Step 3.

501
00:57:09,024 --> 00:57:10,358
Extermination

502
00:57:10,804 --> 00:57:12,988
Now they wont stop antill
everyone is dead.

503
00:57:15,888 --> 00:57:17,109
<i>So what do we do?</i>

504
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:21,131
<i>I mean im not sitting around
here to get exterminated.</i>

505
00:57:22,697 --> 00:57:24,052
<i>We got to get out of here.</i>

506
00:57:24,465 --> 00:57:26,679
<i>If we take one step
out of that door..</i>

507
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,363
<i>If the infected dont get us,
the snipers will.</i>

508
00:57:29,389 --> 00:57:31,133
<i>But you dont have a
choice my friend.</i>

509
00:57:32,673 --> 00:57:34,215
<i>By now its dark out there.</i>

510
00:57:34,372 --> 00:57:37,113
<i>Snipers can see you through
thier night scopes.</i>

511
00:57:37,114 --> 00:57:40,674
<i>At least you have limited
cover from the infected.</i>

512
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,537
But if you wanna wait for sun up.
Then you are good as dead.

513
00:57:46,138 --> 00:57:47,661
Who are you?

514
00:57:48,561 --> 00:57:51,083
Sergeant Doyle.
Delta. Roof top unit.

515
00:57:51,966 --> 00:57:53,478
Why aren`t you at your post?

516
00:57:55,743 --> 00:57:56,882
Why aren`t you?

517
00:57:58,655 --> 00:58:00,666
Look, you guys can do what
you want. But ah..

518
00:58:01,702 --> 00:58:03,329
Im gonna get the
fuck out of here.

519
00:58:04,413 --> 00:58:05,423
Are you coming?

520
00:58:11,904 --> 00:58:12,665
Ok. Come on.

521
00:58:23,489 --> 00:58:25,995
There is less shooting. Maybe
they got under control.

522
00:58:26,255 --> 00:58:27,656
They`ve got less shooters.

523
00:58:29,231 --> 00:58:33,503
Altight listen. You guys look at
me and only me. Ok?

524
00:58:33,702 --> 00:58:36,597
You run when i run. Be my
shadow thats it. Alright?

525
00:58:36,937 --> 00:58:38,867
You on back watch her.

526
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,811
Ready?

527
00:58:42,389 --> 00:58:43,493
Lets go!

528
00:58:54,226 --> 00:58:55,625
Stay.

529
00:58:59,684 --> 00:59:01,208
<i>Doyle. Come in.</i>

530
00:59:06,132 --> 00:59:07,261
Flynn, Go.

531
00:59:07,445 --> 00:59:09,166
Doyle where the fuck
are you man?

532
00:59:13,339 --> 00:59:14,733
Ground level "Destruct 1".

533
00:59:15,404 --> 00:59:16,462
Shit!
Code frequency.

534
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:17,795
Copy that.

535
00:59:21,342 --> 00:59:22,688
<i>What the fuck are
you doing there?</i>

536
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:25,457
<i>Listen to me you got some
serious shit coming your way.</i>

537
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:26,893
I already got some
serious shit.

538
00:59:26,894 --> 00:59:28,948
<i>No. Im not fucking playing.
this is worse.</i>

539
00:59:29,146 --> 00:59:32,359
The aircraft just got thier orders.
They fire ball all of "Destruct 1".

540
00:59:33,373 --> 00:59:34,208
That was fast.

541
00:59:34,209 --> 00:59:36,631
<i>Outbreak is totally out of control
they`re taking no chances.</i>

542
00:59:36,632 --> 00:59:39,872
<i>So unless you`re out of the target zone.
You are getting cooked. You got me?</i>

543
00:59:41,105 --> 00:59:44,338
How long we got?
- They`re already on thier way.
You got 4 minutes, Tops.

544
00:59:44,357 --> 00:59:46,821
But listen. I got some clear
landing ground on "Bridges park".

545
00:59:46,822 --> 00:59:48,547
Thats the pick up place.
Got it?

546
00:59:49,593 --> 00:59:51,771
I`ll be back in touch.
- Doyle you`re fucking better be!

547
00:59:55,016 --> 00:59:58,448
Alright. Look guys, i gotta run ok?
So stay low and stay fast, ok?

548
00:59:58,571 --> 00:59:59,789
After me. Lets go.

549
01:00:07,736 --> 01:00:07,905
Sniper!

550
01:00:08,006 --> 01:00:09,906
Get down! Sniper!

551
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,818
Sniper!
Get Back! Get back!

552
01:00:16,002 --> 01:00:16,939
Andy! Get in!

553
01:00:22,605 --> 01:00:24,653
Its ok.
Its just a lash wound.

554
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,077
Numerous shots wont hit.

555
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:45,190
He`s panic.
He knows march coming.

556
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,357
Whats your name?
- Sam.

557
01:00:55,719 --> 01:00:58,721
Ok Sam. We`re gonna get close.
You see that door way?

558
01:00:59,211 --> 01:01:03,156
I need you to run as fast as you
can in a zig zag, like this. Ok?

559
01:01:03,492 --> 01:01:05,040
And dont stop for anything. Ok?

560
01:01:05,041 --> 01:01:06,285
You want me to be bait?

561
01:01:06,328 --> 01:01:09,475
No. No. Look, He`s gonna
take shots on you. Alright?

562
01:01:09,477 --> 01:01:10,677
And he`s gonna miss.

563
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:12,726
Alright. He`s gonna expose his
position. Means i get a shot of him.

564
01:01:12,723 --> 01:01:15,319
I wont miss.
- You`re out of your fucking mind.

565
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,220
There`s no way im
going out there.

566
01:01:16,264 --> 01:01:17,170
Stay back.

567
01:01:18,447 --> 01:01:20,069
2 Minutes we`re all gonna die.

568
01:01:21,481 --> 01:01:22,394
You want that?

569
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:23,495
No!

570
01:01:23,927 --> 01:01:25,139
Andy!

571
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:26,898
Fuck!

572
01:01:51,015 --> 01:01:51,698
Good work kid.

573
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:02,059
The fence!

574
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:03,867
Go! Go!

575
01:02:07,154 --> 01:02:09,274
Come on!
Come on. Come on.

576
01:02:10,179 --> 01:02:11,313
Jump!

577
01:02:27,712 --> 01:02:29,923
<i>This is "Red fox 1"
report to "Whisky".</i>

578
01:02:32,824 --> 01:02:35,179
<i>Go! We should run
to the river.</i>

579
01:04:16,682 --> 01:04:17,780
Go!

580
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:23,142
Come on!
Come on!

581
01:04:44,973 --> 01:04:48,546
<i>Bring in flat soldier units. Man out
from the 3 jabbed units positions</i>

582
01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:50,205
<i>All units copy?</i>

583
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:56,692
<i>Using chemical weapon authorized. Repeat
all units: Chemical weapon are authorized.</i>

584
01:07:44,011 --> 01:07:45,432
Stay close.

585
01:08:03,816 --> 01:08:05,930
They left our skin.

586
01:08:09,006 --> 01:08:11,135
Do you think mom`s still alive?

587
01:08:13,585 --> 01:08:15,058
Not this time.

588
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:52,431
You look a little pale.
- Blood makes me nauseas.

589
01:08:52,784 --> 01:08:54,643
You never answered
my question.

590
01:08:55,876 --> 01:08:57,750
About, why you left your post?

591
01:08:58,397 --> 01:09:00,633
I never got this boy
out of my sight.

592
01:09:04,435 --> 01:09:06,281
He`s not a target anymore.

593
01:09:11,318 --> 01:09:13,211
When we were separated..

594
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:16,707
I thought i lost you too.

595
01:09:18,848 --> 01:09:20,966
We wont get separated again.

596
01:09:21,997 --> 01:09:24,270
We stay together what
ever happens.

597
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:28,782
What ever happens...

598
01:09:29,107 --> 01:09:30,518
Its all fucked.

599
01:09:33,908 --> 01:09:36,491
You hear all the radios,
its fucked!

600
01:09:42,795 --> 01:09:45,573
Here we are.
What about you?

601
01:09:46,874 --> 01:09:48,346
Why the hell are
you here?

602
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:52,837
Thier mother had very
special blood.

603
01:09:54,498 --> 01:09:57,740
Natural kind of immunity
to the virus.

604
01:10:01,964 --> 01:10:04,337
And not all genetic trace are
paste on, you know.

605
01:10:04,338 --> 01:10:08,658
They can skip a generation or
vanish all together, but..

606
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:10,353
But they might have it.

607
01:10:11,891 --> 01:10:13,320
Its a possibility.

608
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:19,528
So thier lifes are far
more valuable than mine.

609
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:24,289
Or yours.

610
01:10:27,383 --> 01:10:28,638
I got it.

611
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,063
<i>Doyle!</i>

612
01:10:34,102 --> 01:10:35,212
<i>Doyle!</i>

613
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:36,447
Flynn go.

614
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:41,174
I know you do it buddy, listen.
Im coming to you right now.

615
01:10:41,174 --> 01:10:42,654
But keep a lookout ok?

616
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,355
There is a peril
sighting of infected,

617
01:10:44,356 --> 01:10:46,056
That have escaped from
the fire bombing.

618
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:47,277
Give me an ATA.

619
01:10:47,278 --> 01:10:48,042
About 60.

620
01:10:48,882 --> 01:10:49,855
Minutes?

621
01:10:49,677 --> 01:10:52,288
No.. Seconds!

622
01:10:54,022 --> 01:10:55,350
Kids, come on!

623
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,669
Get down! Down, get down!

624
01:11:23,923 --> 01:11:25,813
I see you.
Im coming in!

625
01:11:26,585 --> 01:11:28,484
<i>Jesus Doyle. You got
people with you.</i>

626
01:11:28,398 --> 01:11:30,201
<i>Who the fuck are those people?</i>

627
01:11:44,638 --> 01:11:47,195
<i>Doyle, who the fuck
are those people?</i>

628
01:11:47,389 --> 01:11:50,380
I cant take them!
We will get shot out of the sky,

629
01:11:50,381 --> 01:11:51,381
If i`ll try landing.

630
01:11:51,482 --> 01:11:51,970
No, no, no!

631
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:54,652
Dont take them to base.
Take them over the channel.

632
01:11:54,919 --> 01:11:57,652
What?
- You gotta get these
kids out of here, Flynn.

633
01:11:57,729 --> 01:11:59,900
What the fuck are you doing?
Im not taking them.

634
01:11:59,901 --> 01:12:00,661
<i>Im not leaving them!</i>

635
01:12:03,776 --> 01:12:05,997
Hey! Get him the fuck
off there!

636
01:12:28,749 --> 01:12:31,051
<i>Flynn, we`re gonna fucking
die down here. Do somthing!</i>

637
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:38,039
<i>Come on you fuckers!</i>

638
01:13:10,063 --> 01:13:11,869
Dont look back!
Keep going!

639
01:13:40,848 --> 01:13:42,110
<i>Doyle, come in.</i>

640
01:13:42,111 --> 01:13:42,711
<i>Doyle!</i>

641
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:46,479
<i>You need to get to safe ground. Get
to the stadium. Ditch those people!</i>

642
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:48,756
<i>Im not taking them!</i>

643
01:14:01,252 --> 01:14:03,703
Flynn come in. Flynn goddammit,
i know you can hear me!

644
01:14:03,742 --> 01:14:05,575
Fuck the "Code red". Fuck the
chain in command.

645
01:14:05,576 --> 01:14:07,635
Im stuck down here need
instructions goddammit.

646
01:14:07,636 --> 01:14:09,915
<i>You better fucking be
there because we will.</i>

647
01:14:10,244 --> 01:14:12,784
Hey. Are you ok?
Yeah?

648
01:14:12,988 --> 01:14:15,157
A little tired ha?
Me too.

649
01:14:15,392 --> 01:14:18,575
Look i need you to help me ok? Help

650
01:14:20,161 --> 01:14:21,881
Come on. Gotta go!
