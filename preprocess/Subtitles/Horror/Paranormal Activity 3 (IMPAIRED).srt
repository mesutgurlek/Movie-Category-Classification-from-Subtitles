313
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,623
- That's you right now.
- Oh, that's hilarious.

314
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,917
This has to be erased
and this has to be erased.

315
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:02,170
I'm sorry.
Or we're never having sex again.

316
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:05,131
I'm late. I got to go.
Thanks for erasing both of them.

317
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,842
You know,
you're going to regret saying that.

318
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:08,968
Doubt it.

319
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:11,179
I don't think you can go a day
without having sex, personally.

320
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,638
(IN SING-SONG) Don't dare me.

321
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:15,224
- Erase it.
- I'm not going to erase it.

322
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:18,311
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.

323
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,855
Dude, what are you doing, man?
You're always so late.

324
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,398
I know, it's my car!

325
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,775
I got the earthquake.

326
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,693
- Did you really?
- On tape.

327
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:26,944
It's scary, right? Is that Julie?

328
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:28,112
It's nothing, it's nothing.

329
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,614
- We're going to...
- Is that a sex tape?

330
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,949
Yeah. I got...
This weird thing happened after...

331
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:33,117
She let you make a sex tape?

332
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,161
Yeah, but it got interrupted
by the earthquake.

333
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,829
I wouldn't have let
anything interrupt that.

334
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,040
Relax, man, just relax.
Would you just stop?

335
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,167
- Let me slow-mo shuttle forward.
- Just shut up.

336
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,543
DENNIS: Check this out. Ready?

337
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:44,337
All right, let me tweak the contrast here.

338
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,463
Okay.

339
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:46,589
I'm gonna take the color out.

340
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:49,467
It looks like dust is falling on something.

341
00:16:50,094 --> 00:16:51,260
It looks like a figure, right?

342
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:52,553
- You see that?
- Yeah.

343
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,305
Did you catch that?

344
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,681
- Yeah, it moved.
- Did you see the dust move?

345
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,183
- It moved, right?
- What was that?

346
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,851
I don't know. Check it out.

347
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,395
- It's weird, right?
- It's kind of weird.

348
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:03,106
You know, I've been hearing
these noises in the girls' room lately.

349
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,525
I don't know. I feel like it's...

350
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:06,984
Something weird's going on.

351
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:09,320
- DENNIS: Julie?
- Yeah, I'm back here.

352
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:13,699
Hey, um, I wanted to talk to you...

353
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:14,826
(SHRIEKS) Dennis!

354
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:15,952
Oh, sorry! Sorry.

355
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Oh, my God!

356
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,246
(LAUGHS) Sorry.

357
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,289
You mind if I set up
a couple cameras around the house?

358
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,208
I'm not going to talk to you right now.

359
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,293
Okay, I'll... I'll take that as a yes?

360
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,130
- I hate you!
- Okay. Love you, too.

361
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,716
KATIE: How long do the tapes last?

362
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,051
DENNIS: About six hours each.

363
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:34,178
So you have to change
them every six hours?

364
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,513
Mmm, yes.

365
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:38,724
Katie, can you hop out of the frame?

366
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:40,935
- Okay. Is that good?
- Yeah, so I can...

367
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,645
Keep going.

368
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,022
- KATIE: Can I see it?
- Sure.

369
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,233
Here. Come here. See it?

370
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,401
Yeah.

371
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,403
- Pretty cool, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

372
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,321
So, what are you trying to see?

373
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:54,240
Uh, anything unusual or strange.

374
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,242
Oh, no, it's not that.
Don't touch the camera.

375
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:57,910
- Kristi?
- Yeah?

376
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,579
Don't touch the camera or anything.

377
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,164
Katie, just leave it alone.

378
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,166
(CLATTERING)

379
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,255
- Dennis.
- What?

380
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,506
Really?

381
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,759
Don't you think
you're overreacting a little?

382
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,052
This is a new house.

383
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,221
It shouldn't be making these noises.

384
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:20,349
Not just in here.
It's in the girls' room, too.

385
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:23,895
No...

386
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,482
This is not gonna work here.

387
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,942
Like, what do you think
you're gonna catch?

388
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:32,028
Whatever's in our house.

389
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,657
Oh, right, 'cause there's
something here watching us.

390
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,204
Well, there's definitely something.

391
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,458
I... I feel it.
I feel something, I'm telling you.

392
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,126
JULIE: Yeah, I feel something, too.
I'm not gonna lie.

393
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,294
I feel a camera.

394
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:52,006
The earthquake, and all those...

395
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,258
I don't know,
stuff that's been happening and...

396
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,219
I don't know, I just...

397
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,596
No, it's totally normal.

398
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:00,932
(SIGHS)

399
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,435
Bye, camera.

400
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,481
Good night, camera.

401
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,815
(KISSES)

402
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,714
(CREAKING)

403
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,550
(PATTERING)

404
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,420
Yeah?

405
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,465
Yeah, probably.

406
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,552
In their bedroom.

407
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:22,305
Be quiet, so we don't wake Katie up.

408
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,641
(WHISPERING) It's okay.

409
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:29,937
Why?

410
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:34,984
Oh.

411
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,986
Yeah, kind of.

412
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:38,821
He's very sweet.

413
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,796
Yeah, I saw that.

414
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:58,007
I watched some of the tapes
on the camera

415
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:01,385
and I saw you
talking to somebody late last night.

416
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:05,139
If you saw me talking to somebody,
it would be Toby.

417
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,975
(CHUCKLES) Toby's your friend?

418
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,644
Yes. He's my friend.

419
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,854
Yeah, what do you guys talk about?

420
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,105
Mmm, secrets.

421
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,524
- He's big?
- Mmm-hmm.

422
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,526
So, is he old, like Grandma,

423
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:19,570
or is he young, like you?

424
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,199
He's old, like Grandma.

425
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,284
And what does he look like?

426
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:28,037
Is he tall? Is he fat?

427
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,914
He's tall. He's tall.

428
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:32,917
Don't call him fat.

429
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,128
Kristi, when you say that
if you tell one of your secrets

430
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:39,340
that you'll be in trouble with Toby,
what does that mean?

431
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,842
Well, I won't be safe.

432
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,971
He's gonna...
Did he say he's gonna hurt you?

433
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,098
No.

434
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:50,142
But I won't be safe.

435
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:52,520
That means, I will be, like...

436
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,232
Be in very, very big trouble.

437
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,484
Big trouble.

438
00:21:58,568 --> 00:21:59,735
DENNIS: You saw her.
JULIE: That's how it is.

439
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,237
It was like he was actually there, right?

440
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,363
I know.

441
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:04,865
Because that's how active
kids' imaginations are.

442
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:05,991
It's crazy.

443
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,326
I mean, imagination is one thing.

444
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,036
She got up in the middle of the night.

445
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,580
I mean, it's a little odd
that she got up in the middle...

446
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,166
You haven't been around kids
for that long. They do weird things.

447
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:16,919
They... Katie used to get up
in the middle of the night

448
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,629
and she used to sleep on the toilet.

449
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:19,922
(LAUGHING) What?

450
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,173
Okay? I'm serious.

451
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,299
Really?

452
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:26,011
Yes. Toby is a phase and he's going to
be gone in a couple weeks.

453
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,138
I know it.

454
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:28,848
RANDY: How many hours of footage
do you have?

455
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,976
This is the job, man. I got two cameras,

456
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:34,437
six hours each. Twelve hours.

457
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,939
- Twelve hours of footage?
- Yeah. Got to do it, man.

458
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,066
- I'm seriously gonna review it.
- ...of footage every day.

459
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:41,193
Yes. Now, please,
I'm trying to concentrate.

460
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:44,196
That's so stupid.
There's only 24 hours in a day, Dennis.

461
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,781
- RANDY: Hey, Julie.
- ...going?

462
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,032
DENNIS: Um... Good.

463
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:50,369
You want to step into my office
and do some work with me or...

464
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,455
No. You find anything?

465
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,666
RANDY: Yes, actually.
We did find something.

466
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:59,545
We found that
your family sleeps all night. Oh!

467
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,713
Very funny, Randy.

468
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,131
- Keep up the good work.
- DENNIS: Okay.

469
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,049
I love you with all of my heart and soul.

470
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,801
I love you, too.

471

- Yeah.

630
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:21,601
- What... What is it?
- I took your fan...

631
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:24,855
And basically, took apart...

632
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:27,983
Basically, the oscillator
on your fan allows me to see

633
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,985
both in the living room
and in the kitchen.

Cool. Wait, what? You broke my fan?

635
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:35,365
I can put it back together.

It's like a really high fever

and then you turn the lights back on

994

and then you're supposed
to see her body in the mirror

and she's gonna try to kill you.
