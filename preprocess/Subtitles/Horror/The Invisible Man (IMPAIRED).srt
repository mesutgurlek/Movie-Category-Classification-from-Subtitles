1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,630
This is Rudy Behlmer speaking.
For the next 71 minutes,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,314
I'll be talking about
the background and making of

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,713
<i>the 1933 film version of HG Wells's
novel The Invisible Man,</i>

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,837
a film that still plays remarkably well.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,630
Various outlines, treatments and scripts
were submitted by 12 writers,

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,429
before RC Sherriffs approach was
accepted by all involved,

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,954
including author HG Wells.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,113
Four different directors were slated at
various times to handle the production,

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,760
before James Whale was set.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,311
Boris Karloff was definitely
the studio's choice for the title role

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,516
until late in preproduction.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,957
The amazing special effects
of 1933 by John Fulton

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,318
are still amazing in this day of
seemingly boundless effects technology,

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,076
but details on all this and much more
will follow as we go along.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,199
<i>No, the music you are hearing
is not Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake,</i>

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,193
which was used under the main title
for four Universal horror films,

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,033
<i>beginning with Dracula in 1931,</i>

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,510
but this is an original score
by Heinz Roemheld.

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,433
It's a sparse score, to say the least.

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,909
After the opening,
you won't hear any more of it

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,194
until the last seven minutes of the film.

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,108
The film and HG Wells' novel
open in the exact same way.

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,749
I quote from the beginning
of chapter one in the book:

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,389
"The stranger came early
in February one wintry day,

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,508
through a biting wind and a driving snow,
the last snowfall of the year,

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,276
over the down, walking as it seemed
from Bramblehurst railway station."

27
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,590
"He was wrapped up from head to foot,

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,389
and the brim of his soft felt hat
hid every inch of his face

29
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,869
but the shiny tip of his nose;

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,033
the snow had piled itself
against his shoulders and chest,

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,750
and added a white crest
to the burden he carried."

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,595
Wells's story took place in the West
Sussex village of lping in England,

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,150
but British director James Whale
drew upon his memories

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,199
of growing up in the town of Dudley,
in the West Midlands of England,

35
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,113
in order to cast
and direct character types.

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,432
Whale said "I do not doubt that
when Dudley people see this film,

37
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,273
they will recognise some of these types."

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,909
The village inn,
in the film called "The Lion's Head",

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,313
has a cross section of types
engaging in characteristic activity.

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,909
Typical inn and pub. Conversation,
laughter, a few pints of ale, and darts.

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,119
Enter the mysterious stranger.

42
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,513
He is dramatically pointed up by a series
of three successively closer shots,

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,876
similar to Whale's introduction
of Frankenstein's monster,

44
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,158
<i>played by Boris Karloff in
the 1931 production of Frankenstein.</i>

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,353
But the voice you're going
to hear is certainly not Karloffs.

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,478
Rather, the unmistakable and unique
vocal delivery of Claude Rains,

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,869
who was making his first sound film.

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,080
What happened regarding the planned
casting of Boris Karloff in the title role?

49
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,671
<i>After his success in Frankenstein,</i>

50
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,629
<i>and to a lesser extent,
The Mask of Fu Manchu, on loan to MGM,</i>

51
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,995
<i>and The Mummy,
back at his home studio,</i>

52
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,356
Universal regarded him
as a full-fledged star,

53
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,989
<i>and all along had planned
for him to do The Invisible Man.</i>

54
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,436
But the Great Depression
had taken its toll on Universal,

55
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,071
as well as most of the other studios,
and they were in dire straits.

56
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,358
In May 1933,
when Karloff returned from England,

57
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,352
<i>where he had been on loan
to Gaumont-British for The Ghoul,</i>

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,399
<i>he was still set
for the starring role in The Invisible Man.</i>

59
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,996
Then, in June, he encountered
contract problems with Universal.

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,038
<i>As the trade paper Variety reported,</i>

61
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,874
"Universal is continuing its policy
of dumping contract players

62
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,349
as soon as
they reach the big-money class,

63
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,671
and substituting them
with new people at less money."

64
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,435
"The latest Universal star
to go off the list is Boris Karloff."

65
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,197
"At the studio 18 months,
Karloff had been drawing $750 per week

66
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,354
and was scheduled to get $1250
on his coming option jump."

67
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,993
"The sum represented a jump of $500,
or $250 each for two option periods."

68
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,640
"Karloff waived
the previous option increase,

69
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,598
which would have boosted
his salary to $1000,

70
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,389
on condition that he would get
the full amount on the next option."

71
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,674
"Universal refused to meet
the figure, which came due Thursday,

72
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,877
and Karloff walked."

73
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,389
Whale offered the role
to fellow Britisher Colin Clive,

74
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,189
who had been the director's leading man
in both the stage and screen versions

75
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,748
<i>of the well-received Journey's End,</i>

76
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,197
and who played the leading role of Dr
Frankenstein, who creates the monster,

77
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,590
<i>in Whale's 1931 film of Frankenstein.</i>

78
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,911
But Clive, who had
a marvellous voice and delivery,

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,470
had just completed two additional
film roles in Hollywood,

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,031
and wanted to get back to England,
although the part did appeal to him.

81
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,910
<i>In the British magazine Picturegoer,
in July 1933:</i>

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,790
<i>"Colin Clive gets a kick out of playing
parts like his grim role in Frankenstein."</i>

83
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,396
"He certainly does not see himself
as a leading man or romantic lover."

84
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,755
"He wants the strong stuff."

85
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,075
Now what?
Whale remembered Claude Rains,

86
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,073
and discovered that he had made
a screen test for RKO Radio Pictures

87
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,711
<i><b>for the leading male role
in A Bill of Divorcement in 1932.</b></i>

88
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,477
Apparently it was not good.
In fact, it was, in the actor's own words,

89
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,518
"the worst screen test
in the history of movie-making".

90
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,434
He said that when Whale saw it,
he howled with laughter.

91
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,159
<i><b>Incidentally,
the part in A Bill of Divorcement</b></i>

92
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,232
went to luminary John Barrymore.

93
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,949
But Whale wanted Rains
and his special presence.

94
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,591
A test was made, and Rains, who had
been appearing in Broadway plays,

95
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,638
was signed at virtually the last moment.

96
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,793
Unless one had seen him on the stage
in his native England, or in New York,

97
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,158
the unique and commanding
texture of his vocal delivery

98
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,391
would be a new experience
for movie-goers at that time.

99
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,472
That's why Whale wanted him,
for his voice.

100
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,475
Whale knew Rains and his work and he
knew the voice had to be a distinctive one

101
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,393
because of the unusual nature of the role.

102
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,392
He also wanted a highly-trained
and consummate actor,

103
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,679
who would be able to give extra
dimensions to what might be regarded

104
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,991
as merely a highly-charged,
melodramatic role.

105
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,718
Rains had played a vast range of roles
in his many years in the theatre,

106
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,634
and was never typecast.

107
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,271
So far, the film has been following
the HG Wells novel very closely,

108
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,878
but RC Sherriff quite rightly felt that some
changes in Wells's novel were necessary

109
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,351
in order to present a more unified
structure for a 70-minute film

110
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,072
and to give the mysterious stranger
certain sympathetic qualities for contrast.

111
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,039
Sherriffs modifications
were thoughtful and not capricious.

112
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,357
A change of scene.

113
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,236
We are introduced in this sequence
to two characters not in the novel at all,

114
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,471
but very much a strong presence
in the screenplay.

115
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,279
Dr Cranley, played by Henry Travers,

116
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,238
is obviously a scientist or medical man,

117
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,596
and we shortly find out that
the mysterious man at the inn

118
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,117
is probably Jack Griffin,
a scientist employed by Dr Cranley

119
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,876
who has been gone for a month,
working on a private experiment.

120
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
But his whereabouts are unknown.

121
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,315
Flora, played by Gloria Stuart,
is Dr Cranley's distressed daughter,

122
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,155
who, we can tell, is very much in love
with Jack Griffin, the stranger at the inn.

123
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,190
To get maximum mileage from this
character introduction and exposition,

124
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,636
we learn a bit about
Griffin's secretive experiments,

125
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,350
which, combined with what we've seen
of his actions previously at the inn,

126
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,159
<i>and the film's title, The Invisible Man,</i>

127
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,312
leaves little doubt
about what he's been up to.

128
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,198
The gradual revealment
is a necessary dramatic setup

129
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,589
for the events that will follow.

130
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,672
This exposition
of character relationships is expanded

131
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,880
by the introduction of Dr Kemp, played by
William Harrigan, a character in the novel

132
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,556
whose role is greatly enlarged
for dramatic purposes in the film.

133
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,791
He obviously is
in the employ of Flora's father,

134
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,348
as is Jack Griffin, the Rains character.

135
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,398
It's necessary to get
Flora and Kemp to another area,

136
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,119
via Whale's use
of the lateral camera move,

137
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,876
which, as in the theatre, breaks away
walls and leads us to another room.

138
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,671
Now Kemp is able to have
a more intimate discussion with Flora.

139
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,877
He's presented here
as a romantic rival for Flora,

140
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,033
and as a not particularly charming suitor.

141
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,556
While under contract
to Universal Pictures for four years,

142
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,395
Gloria Stuart, who plays Flora, did
two other films for director James Whale:

143
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,476
<i><b>The Old Dark House in 1932
and The Kiss Before the Mirror in 1933.</b></i>

144
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,277
Stuart has said that Whale was
an exceptionally well prepared

145
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,271
and enthusiastic director.

146
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,716
On his script, he had each
camera setup for the day's shooting

147
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,951
noted in his own handwriting
opposite the dialogue.

148
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,797
Many other performers and technicians
have noted Whale's meticulous approach.

149
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,634
William Harrigan had been an actor
on the stage since the age of five.

150
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,554
In 1929, he went to Hollywood
with the advent of talking pictures,

151
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,030
and the mass exodus
of many Broadway players.

152
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,717
Now, Dr Kemp is declaring,
quite emphatically, his feelings for Flora,

153
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,238
who, not too subtly, is surrounded by
flowers in the photographic compositions.

154
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,550
Flora, flowers.

155
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,633
Anyway, Flora amply
demonstrates a definitive example

156
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,154
of the attraction/repulsion theory

157
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,437
by her reaction
to Kemp's romantic overture.

158
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,229
In this instance,
repulsion wins hands down.

159
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,236
Meanwhile, back at the inn,

160
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,517
the mysterious stranger
is trying desperately

161
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,718
to find a solution to an aspect
of his experiment, one of many,

162
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,712
that we're not too clear about as yet.

163
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,116
We wonder about his intense frustration.

164
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,548
Una O'Connor,
whose real name was Agnes McGlade,

165
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,677
was born in Belfast, Ireland in 1880.

166
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,751
She attended convent school,

167
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,594
and joined the school
of the Abbey Players in Dublin.

168
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,070
She made her official debut in 1911.

169
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,312
Una acted with the Abbey Players,
the Irish Repertory Company,

170
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,356
and the Irish Literary Theatre,

171
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,036
in plays by Shakespeare, O'Casey,
Yeats, lbsen, Shaw and Galsworthy.

172
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,398
In 1913, she made
her London debut at Court Theatre,

173
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,233
and she acted in various London plays.

174
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,915
<i>In 1931,
there was that great success Cavalcade,</i>

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,673
which featured Una
as the cockney charwoman.

176
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,638
When Fox planned
to film the Noël Coward play,

177
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,950
they sent for Una, and Merle Tottenham,

178
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,511
<i>who had played the maid of Cavalcade,
and reprises that role in this film.</i>

179
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,790
In 1933, James Whale, who had
known Una from the London stage,

180
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,793
<i>invited her and Merle
to act in his Invisible Man.</i>

181
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,751
For many years, she appeared in
many memorable Hollywood films,

182
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,832
<i>including James Whale's
sequel to Frankenstein,</i>

183
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,071
<i><b>the 1935 Bride of Frankenstein.</b></i>

184
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,839
<i><b>Some of her other supporting roles
include The Barretts of Wimpole Street,</b></i>

185
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,277
<i>David Copperfield, The Informer,
The Adventures of Robin Hood,</i>

186
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,558
<i>The Sea Hawk, How Green Was
my Valley, Random Harvest,</i>

187
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,519
<i><b>The Bells of St Mary's,
and Adventures of Don Juan.</b></i>

188
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,520
There are many British players
in this film,

189
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,876
most from theatre,
both in England and America,

190
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,999
and some who arrived in Hollywood
after the introduction of sound.

191
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,191
Whale had worked with or knew them,

192
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,149
and naturally felt comfortable when
he personally cast them in the film.

193
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,310
This gentleman is Forrester Harvey,

194
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,473
who was born in
County Cork, Ireland, in 1884.

195
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,438
He moved to London at a very young age,

196
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,478
and before coming to America in 1924

197
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,758
Harvey had been featured in
English film comedies for ten years.

198
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,831
He then appeared in New York plays.

199
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,913
Returning to London,
he accepted the role of Lieutenant Trotter

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,072
<i>in the Whale-directed
hit play Journey's End,</i>

201
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,197
and then again came to America,
this time to stay.

202
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,750
<i>His film roles include
Tarzan the Ape Man, Red Dust,</i>

203
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,190
<i><b>Tarzan and his Mate, Captain Blood,</b></i>

204
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,477
<i>Rebecca, The Invisible Man Returns,</i>

205
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,552
<i>the 1941 Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,</i>

206
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,791
<i>The Wolf Man, Mrs Miniver
and many others.</i>

207
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,555
We now see that the stranger
is capable of a furious outburst,

208
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,916
and we'll see extreme violence,

209
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,915
a portent of his obviously
unstable and dangerous state.

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,675
Una O'Connor
is capable of bursting forth

211
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:10,437
with an incredible volley of
high-decibel cackles, screams, shrieks

212
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,478
that seem rather over the top,
to say the least.

213
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,157
There's another scene a little later where
she reprises her full complement of these.

214
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,155
Fair warning. Obviously, director
James Whale didn't think it was too rich.

215
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,598
In fact, two years later, he had her going
through her screech repertoire again

216
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,148
<i><b>for Bride of Frankenstein.</b></i>

217
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,630
But interestingly, you don't hear her
going anywhere near that level

218
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,111
in her many other fine characterisations
through the decades.

219
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,352
<i>HG Wells's novel The Invisible Man
was first serialised in England</i>

220
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,591
<i>in Pearson's Weekly, in 1897,</i>

221
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,672
and then published
in book form that same year.

222
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,718
Universal had a synopsis
in the late 1920s,

223
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,917
when Wells's agent
was offering motion picture rights.

224
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,075
MGM apparently turned it down in 1931
because of potential technical obstacles.

225
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,280
But Universal, by late 1931,
was seriously considering the title

226
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,237
<i>as one of the follow-ups
to their Dracula and Frankenstein.</i>

227
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,833
The studio executives
turned to John Fulton,

228
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,799
the head of what was then referred to
as the "trick department",

229
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,591
to see if it was possible to create and
execute acceptable effects for the subject.

230
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,878
Fulton said yes,
so Universal bought the story rights

231
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,556
on September 22nd 1931 for $10,000,

232
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,395
with author HG Wells granted
script approval as part of the deal.

233
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,153
The studio also bought,
about that same time,

234
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,951
<i>a new 1931 novel by Philip Wylie
called The Murderer Invisible.</i>

235
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,554
But more about that anon.

236
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,349
John Fulton, nicknamed "The Doctor"
around the lot,

237
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,079
knew that the travelling-matte technique

238
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,436
would be the way to approach
the most dazzling of the effects.

239
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,590
Before coming to work at Universal,

240
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,752
Fulton worked for the
Frank Williams Laboratory in Hollywood.

241
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,798
Where the travelling-matte system
had evolved.

242
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,919
<i>Fulton wrote an article on
The Invisible Man for the June 1934 issue</i>

243
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,594
<i>of American Cinematographer,
and I quote:</i>

244
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,109
"Pulling off a nose.
This scene was made by using a dummy,

245
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,794
an exact replica of the player's make-up."

246
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,397
"And then the unwrapping action
was handled in the same fashion

247
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,391
as the other half-clad scenes,

248
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,234
that is, by multiple printing
with travelling mattes."

249
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,149
"We had considerable trouble in getting
the actor to move naturally,

250
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,915
yet without ever passing
his hands in front of himself."

251
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,799
This is only a warm-up, of course,
for the multiplicity of effects that follow.

252
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,189
We are now about
17 minutes into the film,

253
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,477
and the build-up
to this moment has been just right.

254
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,111
We were allowed one brief profile shot
of an invisible mouth, chin and jaw

255
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,158
several minutes ago,
and now with the unwrapping shots

256
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,470
we wait with fascinating anticipation

257
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,872
to see what lengths the invisibility
presentation will take us next.

258
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,829
For the undressing scenes, RC Sherriff
wrote a note in his screenplay...

259
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,913
Wait a minute. I guess the invisible man
doesn't wear underwear.

260
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,268
Anyway, his note says:

261
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,319
"I suggest that trick photography
be employed here, as far as possible,

262
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,838
with the aid of invisible wire frames
manipulated by the marionette method."

263
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,277
But, as Fulton explained,
"the wire technique could not be used,

264
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,875
for the clothes would look empty
and would hardly move naturally".

265
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,589
"So we had recourse
to multiple printing with variations."

266
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,752
"Most of these scenes involve
other, normal characters,

267
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,149
so we shot these scenes
in the normal manner

268
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,674
but without any trace
of the invisible man."

269
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,593
"All of the action, of course,
had to be carefully timed,

270
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,989
as in any sort of double-exposure work."

271
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,197
"The negative was then developed
in the normal manner."

272
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,034
"The scenes in which he is totally
invisible are, of course, very simple."

273
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,318
"Anything he may move about, such
as furniture, books, a bicycle and so on,

274
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,551
could be moved by fine wires
invisible to the camera,

275
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,996
and thereby give exactly the right effect."

276
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,998
Actor EE Clive,
playing the police constable,

277
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,548
<i>made his film debut in The Invisible Man.</i>

278
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,596
Incidentally, his first name was Edward.

279
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,912
Born in Wales, Clive was a master of
the various dialects of the British Isles,

280
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,150
and toured extensively in the provinces

281
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,277
after taking up a stage career
at the age of 22.

282
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,591
He moved to the United States in 1912.

283
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,389
He only spent seven years in Hollywood
films before dying from a heart attack,

284
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,792
but in that short span,
racked up over 80 movies.

285
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,755
We've now moved from melodrama
into knockabout comedy,

286
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,593
with the invisible man
leading us through a parade

287
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,117
of Whale's expertly
choreographed physical wire effects,

288
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,591
all carefully rigged and executed
by Al Johnson and Bob Laslow.

289
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,878
Of course, the actors had
to move and react convincingly

290
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,996
to make these quick cuts work.

291
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,039
A bicycle riding away by itself
is on a concealed track,

292
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,078
and wires above kept the bike upright.

293
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,877
The invisible man's patter during
this collage was not in the script,

294
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,793
but was probably post-recorded by Rains.

295
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,398
Much of Rains' dialogue throughout
the film was either pre- or post-recorded.

296
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,553
Most of the exteriors made
were shot on the back lot at Universal.

297
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,439
EE Clive worked for director James Whale
in five additional films.

298
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,799
<i><b>One More River, Bride of Frankenstein,
Remember Last Night?</b></i>

299
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,836
<i><b>Show Boat, and The Great Garrick.</b></i>

300
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,515
<i><b>Some of his other credits include
A Tale of Two Cities, Captain Blood,</b></i>

301
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,398
<i><b>Libeled Lady, Camille,
The Charge of the Light Brigade,</b></i>

302
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,995
<i><b>The Hound of the Baskervilles,
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,</b></i>

303
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,312
<i>and his last film, Hitchcock's
Foreign Correspondent in 1940.</i>

304
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,553
Not only a change of scene,
but a total change in mood.

305
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,712
More developments regarding
Jack Griffin's experiments,

306
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,635
and one major discovery coming up,
regarding a dangerous drug.

307
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,395
We are so accustomed to the wonderful
character actor Henry Travers

308
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,874
being cast as a whimsical, bemused
benign person, often slightly eccentric,

309
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,953
that it's curious here to see him
playing seemingly straight and sombre.

310
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,951
This was only his fourth film.

311
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,160
Although born of Irish parents in England
on the Scottish border in 1874,

312
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,550
he had been in America since
the beginning of the 20th century,

313
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,871
and appeared for years
on Broadway in major works,

314
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,316
including seven plays
by George Bernard Shaw,

315
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,758
<i>in addition to Liliom, Volpone
and Reunion in Vienna, et cetera.</i>

316
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,833
He made his film debut
in the latter in 1933.

317
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,992
Travers, whose real name
was Travers Heagerty,

318
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,878
had appeared in two plays
with Claude Rains,

319
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,633
<i>Camel Through the Needle's Eye in 1929</i>

320
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,917
<i>and the stage version
of The Good Earth in 1932.</i>

321
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,235
Dr Cranley tells Kemp
about the drug monocane.

322
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,993
The doctor has discovered
this on a list of chemicals

323
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,389
which had been left behind by Griffin.

324
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,314
Cranley refers to monocane
as "a terrible drug"

325
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,153
that "draws colour
from everything it touches".

326
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,233
He also says that the drug
gradually induces madness.

327
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,756
The fictional monocane was
an invention by screenwriter RC Sherriff.

328
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,151
In the book, Griffin, a university student,
has damaged his mind with strychnine.

329
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,550
But by having monocane
be part of the invisibility formula

330
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,074
as well as a mind-altering drug,

331
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,790
which presumably was not known by
Griffin, per the dialogue in this scene,

332
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,555
gives an acceptable motive
for his various acts in the film,

333
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,916
versus the book's one-note monomania.

334
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,230
<i>In the 1940 Universal sequel
The Invisible Man Returns,</i>

335
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,551
the name of the drug
is changed to duocane,

336
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,953
presumably marketed underground as
"New, improved and double-strength".

337
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,710
<i><b>A few of Henry Travers' 52 films
include Ball of Fire, High Sierra,</b></i>

338
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,952
<i>Mrs Miniver, Random Harvest,
Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt,</i>

339
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,679
<i>and that hardy perennial, Frank Capra's
It's a Wonderful Life in 1946</i>

340
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,513
as the memorable Clarence, the angel.

341
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,591
He died in 1965.

342
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,076
A quiet evening at home,
reading and listening to the radio.

343
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,391
A sidebar, if I may:
The tune being played on the radio

344
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,315
is that apotheosis of maudlin
sentimentality "Hearts and Flowers",

345
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,995
performed in an old-fashioned manner
even for 1933,

346
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,835
on what sounds like an upright piano
with all the frills and trills.

347
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,789
Presumably, this is an inside joke,
put in by a music editor some years later,

348
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,270
to replace the music used
for the initial release of the film.

349
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,749
That music was "La Rosita",

350
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,549
a 1923 composition
that became a semi-standard.

351
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,077
The substitution probably stemmed
from a music clearance situation.

352
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,028
The invisible man has decided
to pay a visit to his old colleague.

353
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,873
The radio announcer
begins the news with a report

354
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,793
about an invisible man
in the village of lping.

355
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,238
Kemp is interested. Then the radio, of
course, is turned off by you know who.

356
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,551
Both writer RC Sherriff
and director Whale did not want

357
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,792
to rely on just the invisible man's voice
to indicate his presence

358
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,555
during scenes when he's totally invisible,
as in this situation.

359
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,712
They wanted the audience
to be drawn to the character,

360
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,998
so everything was set up,
staged and photographed to this end.

361
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,952
<i>Whale told Film Weekly "It was all very
well to film the scenes without the actor,</i>

362
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,318
but I knew that I had in some way
to let the audience know clearly

363
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,756
that the actor was there all the time,
although he was invisible."

364
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,798
"Therefore, in nearly every one
of the 'invisible' scenes,

365
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,556
I had to devise bits of business so
the audience should know where he was,

366
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,551
what he was doing and so on."

367
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,518
"In one scene,
I made him sit in a rocking chair,

368
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,991
so by the movements of the chair,
the audience would realise he was there,

369
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,310
although there was
no sign of his presence."

370
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,039
"He's sitting in a chair
talking to another person."

371
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,590
"I showed the seat of the chair
sagging slightly as he sat down."

372
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,478
"Then, when his voice
became more confidential,

373
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,518
I had the chair moved
a few inches toward the other person,

374
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,596
as though the invisible man had drawn it
closer for more intimate conversation."

375
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,797
Although we have been seeing
strictly wire effects here,

376
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,510
Sherriff and Whale mix it with intriguing
travelling-matte work you've just seen,

377
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,151
for the cigarette lighter, the handling
of the cigarette and smoking effect.

378
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,028
William Harrigan, the actor playing Kemp,
was a last-minute substitute

379
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,351
for Chester Morris,
who had been scheduled for the role.

380
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,752
Morris was a leading player, who had
come from the theatre to Hollywood.

381
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,479
<i><b>He had starred in
The Big House, The Bat Whispers</b></i>

382
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,869
<i>and The Red-Headed Woman
opposite Jean Harlow,</i>

383
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,918
<i>just before being slated
for The Invisible Man.</i>

384
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,436
But, when newcomer
to American films Claude Rains

385
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,954
was signed and given top billing,

386
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,875
Morris, who already was unhappy with
his unsympathetic and colourless role,

387
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,475
after finally reading the script,
bowed out around mid-June,

388
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,028
shortly before the start of filming.

389
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,634
Harrigan and Claude Rains
had recently appeared

390
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,598
in the well-received Theatre
Guild production on Broadway

391
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,116
<i>of the Irish drama,
The Moon in the Yellow River.</i>

392
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,990
It's possible that Rains recommended him
to Whale after Morris pulled out.

393
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,676
Harrigan had become a leading man on
the Broadway stage by his 21st birthday.

394
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,116
His family was one
of the oldest in theatre history,

395
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,069
having been on the stage
uninterruptedly since 1660.

396
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,835
<i>Some of Harrigan's films include
'G' Men with James Cagney,</i>

397
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,152
<i>The Farmer's Daughter, with Loretta
Young, Desert Fury with Burt Lancaster</i>

398
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,118
<i>and Flying Leathernecks
with John Wayne.</i>

399
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,476
He created the role of the Captain
in the stage production

400
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,792
<i>of the extremely popular
Mister Roberts in 1948,</i>

401
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,270
and stayed with it
during its original three-year run.

402
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,353
His sister was film
and stage actress Nedda Harrigan.

403
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,274
The actor died in 1966 at age 79.

404
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,872
<i>I would like to talk about the person who
wrote The Invisible Man novel in 1897,</i>

405
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,871
HG Wells.

406
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,996
Herbert George Wells.

407
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,278
An English novelist and journalist,
who was known for his science fiction,

408
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,831
his satirical novels and
his popular books on history and science.

409
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,151
He was a vigorous advocate
of socialism, feminism,

410
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,392
evolutionism, nationalism
and the advancement of science.

411
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,472
Often called the first
great writer of science fiction,

412
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,714
<i>Wells wrote The Time Machine, The
Island of Dr Moreau, The Invisible Man,</i>

413
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,191
<i>The War of the Worlds, The First
Men in the Moon, among many others.</i>

414
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:17,160
They were all published at the end of the
19th century and beginning of the 20th.

415
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,313
Wells was not the first to write
about a person becoming invisible.

416
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,111
In 1833, James Dalton composed
an ambitious cautionary tale

417
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,875
<i>in a three-decker novel
called The Invisible Gentleman.</i>

418
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,872
Later, Edward Page Mitchell
dealt with the subject

419
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,839
<i>in a story called The Crystal Man in 1881.</i>

420
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,233
<i>And CH Hinton wrote a tale of invisibility
titled Stella in 1895.</i>

421
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,431
These are just a few examples.

422
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,750
<i>In The Invisible Man novel,
Wells writes about Griffin's experiments</i>

423
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,197
that involve a fourth dimension,
in this case, light.

424
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,432
Refraction, reflection.
He goes into pigment research

425
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,718
and optical density, which determines
the degree of visibility of things.

426
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,677
There is a two-phase process
using a drug and a mechanical device.

427
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,919
By an ingenious use of scientific patter
it all seems perfectly logical and feasible,

428
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,993
especially since Wells wrote
in a very straightforward style.

429
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,072
Of course, his books contain
highly imaginative ideas

430
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,438
that have been the basis for
many films over the past 100 years.

431
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,876
In the film, the invisibility
experiments are reduced to

432
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,715
Griffin talking about trying "a thousand
experiments, a thousand failures",

433
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,268
and mentioning "a mixture of drugs".

434
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,353
Add to this Dr Cranley discussing
monocane in an earlier scene,

435
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,353
and that takes care of what
the audience is allowed to know.

436
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,873
The scene between Griffin and Kemp
was used for Claude Rains' test.

437
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,988
<i>He had been appearing in the play Peace
Palace in New York in early June 1933,</i>

438
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,870
so the test probably was made in New
York and was not directed by Whale.

439
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,192
Also, Rains was not done up
in bandages and goggles for the test.

440
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,840
The actor said that
he had never read the novel,

441
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,118
and he had no idea that his face
would not be seen during the film.

442
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,079
Rains said
"For five years - five years, mind -

443
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,598
I was prating to the Theatre Guild about
my artistic integrity. My artistic integrity!"

444
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,389
"Then, the first day at the studio,
James brought over some bandages."

445
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,235
"I asked about them and he said I was to
be bandaged during most of the picture."

446
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,598
"And I had been fighting with the Theatre
Guild about my artistic integrity!"

447
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,069
"It served me right."

448
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,077
Rains recalled also that "James kept
talking about this and that in pictures,

449
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,151
about actors of whom I'd never heard."

450
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,550
"When he learned
I'd only seen six films or so in my life,

451
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,631
he told me
to go right out and see pictures,

452
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,110
to see three a day
until I knew something about them."

453
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,113
Now, listen to Griffin's plan.

454
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,318
<i>I... You mean...?</i>

455
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,914
<i>I must have a partner, Kemp,</i>

456
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,072
<i>a visible partner,
to help me in the little things.</i>

457
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,950
<i>You're my partner, Kemp.</i>

458
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,030
<i>We'll begin with a reign of terror.</i>

459
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,031
<i>A few murders here and there.</i>

460
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,240
<i>Murders of great men
and murders of little men,</i>

461
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,709
<i>just to show we make no distinction.</i>

462
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,189
<i>We might even wreck a train or two.</i>

463
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,638
<i>Just these fingers round
a signalman's throat, that's all.</i>

464
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,793
We think of Claude Rains' very distinctive
and dramatically appealing voice,

465
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,394
but it was not always thus.

466
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,600
William Claude Rains was born in 1889
in London. The family was poor.

467
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,719
Hating school and teased by classmates
because of a serious speech impediment,

468
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,916
he ran away at a very young age.

469
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,198
After appearing in a crowd scene on
the stage of London's Haymarket Theatre,

470
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,478
Rains, at age 10 in 1900,
made the monumental decision

471
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,949
to devote his life to the theatre.

472
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,350
But in addition to a broad cockney accent
and a stutter,

473
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,715
Rains had other speech problems.

474
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,633
Over 50 years later, when Rains received

475
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:13,670
the Medal for Good Speech on the Stage,
in New York, he recalled:

476
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,036
"Almost my first occupation
in the theatre was a callboy."

477
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,317
"I had to summon actors from
their dressing rooms to the stage."

478
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,599
"It was difficult to be taken seriously
because I had a speech impediment."

479
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:31,630
"I had no Rs. If anyone asked my name,
my answer came out as 'Willy Wains'."

480
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,039
I had ideas that someday
I would become an actor,

481
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,192
so the all-important thing
was to get rid of the impediment."

482
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,874
"I discovered I had a 'lazy tongue',

483
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,428
the muscle of which
had never properly been used,

484
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,832
because my mother
thought I talked 'pwettily'."

485
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,354
But Rains worked hard
to overcome his problem.

486
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,194
He took elocution lessons,
did voice and speech exercises,

487
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,669
and worked on them with great intensity.

488
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,595
He also listened, and observed everything
in the theatrical atmosphere around him.

489
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,992
He made his adult acting debut
as Claude Rains in 1911,

490
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,991
again at the Haymarket Theatre,

491
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,314
his voice
and speech problems conquered.

492
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,235
Walter Brennan, before
he became a major character actor.

493
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,230
In the British Army
in France during World War I,

494
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,553
Rains was subjected to heavy
artillery bombardment and poison gas.

495
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,359
As a result, while in the infirmary

496
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,398
he discovered that his vocal chords
had been paralysed,

497
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,472
and that his right eye
was almost completely blind.

498
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,076
Eventually he was able to speak again,

499
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,870
and Rains later would say that
the unique, husky quality of his voice

500
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,997
was due to the effects of the poison gas.

501
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,392
But his near-blindness
in his right eye was another matter.

502
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,270
Only his family and some
very close friends were aware of it.

503
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,158
That lasted through the rest of his life.

504
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,710
Rains had a distinguished career
on the London stage,

505
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,633
playing in
some very important productions,

506
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,110
including a series
of George Bernard Shaw plays.

507
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,990
He also became an acting teacher at the
famous Royal Academy of Dramatic Art,

508
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,356
where he worked with such
students and later luminaries

509
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,557
as Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud.

510
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,474
In late 1926,
he moved to the Broadway stage

511
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,677
in American touring
companies of hit plays.

512
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,638
Rains went on to become,
in the late 1920s,

513
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,792
the Theatre Guild's
outstanding character actor.

514
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,873
Now we're going to see more physical
effects - mostly wire effects - coming up

515
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,999
to get material out of his room
and down to the street.

516
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,548
None of this involved travelling mattes,

517
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,235
but it involved heavy-wire work
that you couldn't see

518
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,232
because of the thinness of the wires.

519
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,515
The actor playing Inspector Bird
is Britisher Harry Stubbs,

520
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,229
who had been
in American films since 1929.

521
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,633
<i>Horror film buffs will recognise him from
later appearances in Werewolf of London,</i>

522
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,077
<i>The Invisible Man Returns,
The Mummy's Hand, The Wolf Man</i>

523
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,469
<i>and Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man.</i>

524
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,796
For those who wanted yet another round
of Una's shrieks, this is the moment.

525
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,350
It is also her grand finale for this film.

526
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,719
In 1954, Una was
a very frail and weak 74 years old,

527
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,078
but she couldn't resist taking
the part of the deaf Scottish maid

528
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,674
whose testimony provides comic relief

529
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,548
<i>in Agatha Christie's play
Witness for the Prosecution.</i>

530
00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:00,158
A major hit,
it ran for 645 performances in New York.

531
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,028
Una's portrayal delighted audiences.

532
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,270
Billy Wilder directed the film version,

533
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,798
starring Tyrone Power, Charles Laughton
and Marlene Dietrich in 1957,

534
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,273
and Una went to Hollywood for her last
screen appearance, recreating her role.

535
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,716
She died in 1959 at the age of 78.

536
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,591
Two years earlier, James Whale, when
he died, had left a bequest to the actress.

537
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,436
Now the invisible man has started to
put into practice his "reign of terror".

538
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,229
Remember that speech about beginning
with a few murders, here and there?

539
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,279
Inspector Bird was his first murder victim,
but we know there are more to come,

540
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,715
perhaps on a big scale.

541
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,709
Here's actor John Carradine,
then known as John Peter Richmond,

542
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,759
when he was playing
small roles around Hollywood.

543
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,913
Coming up very soon is one of
the most ingenious but complicated

544
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,150
travelling-matte shots in the film.

545
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,915
Special-effects technician John Fulton
will explain in his own words

546
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,275
his working methods for the matte shots.

547
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,876
As stated earlier, the scenes involving
the invisible man partially clothed

548
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,431
or totally invisible but with props
such as cigarettes or lighters visible,

549
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,308
along with other characters on the set,
were photographed as normal,

550
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,838
but without any evidence of the
invisible man and/or the handled props.

551
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,038
The negative was then developed. After
the entire film was finished shooting,

552
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,032
Fulton and his crew,
along with director James Whale,

553
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,997
began the special process work.

554
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:00,473
Said Fulton "We used a completely black
set, walled and floored with black velvet,

555
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,028
to be as nearly
non-reflective as possible."

556
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,317
"Our actor was garbed from head to foot
in black velvet tights,

557
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,951
with black gloves and a black headpiece
rather like a diver's helmet."

558
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,918
"Over this, he wore
whatever clothes might be required."

559
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,393
"This gave us a picture of unsupported
clothes moving on a dead black field."

560
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,756
From this negative, we made
a print and a duplicate negative,

561
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,469
which we intensified
to serve as mattes for printing."

562
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,031
"Then, with an ordinary printer,
we made our composite."

563
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,588
Now here's that scene I was talking about.

564
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,319
John Fulton says
"This shot had to show

565
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,995
the man himself from the rear,
and his reflection in the mirror."

566
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,079
"Ordinarily this would be simple enough,
but when you add the difficulties

567
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,516
of showing the unwrapping
of an invisible head,

568
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,273
you have some complicated
problems to solve."

569
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,909
"This required the making
of four separate takes,

570
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,551
combined by the travelling-matte
printing system into one picture."

571
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,393
"First, there was the shot
of the wall and the mirror,

572
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,313
with the mirror itself
masked out by black velvet."

573
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,076
"Next, a separate shot of the opposite wall
of the room, as reflected in the mirror."

574
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,756
"Thirdly, the shot of the invisible man
from the rear, unwrapping his bandages,

575
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,231
and lastly, the reflection of him
from the front doing the same act."

576
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,709
"All of these had to be
perfectly coordinated,

577
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,271
matched in viewpoint, perspective
and action to a fraction of an inch."

578
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,999
"Several of the negatives
required hand retouching."

579
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,675
"And last, but far from least,
the action had to be figured out

580
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,356
so that the hands of the actor did not
pass between himself and the camera

581
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,193
or between
the reflection and the camera."

582
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,795
"It was as difficult
a shot as I have ever made."

583
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,195
In some scenes it was possible
to leave small eyeholes

584
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,193
in the black headpiece the person
in the all-black outfit had on.

585
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,795
But for other shots, such as
the close shots of the head unwrapping,

586
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,509
this was not possible,
and the actor had to work blind.

587
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,878
Sometimes the actor was Claude Rains,
but often it was a double.

588
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,077
Air was supplied through tubes,
as in a diving suit.

589
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,153
The tubes were mostly concealed,
running up a trouser leg.

590
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,754
Fulton recalled
that on at least one occasion

591
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,229
either the air supply developed a problem,

592
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,710
or the summer heat
along with the units lighting the set...

593
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,476
In any case, something. The double
was overcome and he fainted mid-scene.

594
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,758
Fulton recalled "In nearly all of these
scenes, though they were made silent,

595
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,435
it was difficult, sometimes impossible,
to direct the actor."

596
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,114
"The helmet muffled
the sound from outside,

597
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,953
and the air tubes made
a roaring rumble in his ears,

598
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,272
which drowned out any sounds which
might filter through the padding."

599
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,319
"When I used a large megaphone,
and shouted at the top of my voice,

600
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,914
he could just barely hear a faint murmur."

601
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,755
"Accordingly, we had to rehearse, and
rehearse, and then make many takes."

602
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,912
"As a rule, by take 20 of any such scene,

603
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,152
we felt ourselves merely well started
toward getting our shot."

604
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,270
Also, care had to be taken
to get the actor to move naturally,

605
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,237
yet in a way that did not present,

606
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,278
for example,
an open sleeve-end to the camera,

607
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,396
which would destroy the illusion.

608
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,756
Also, the actor couldn't pass
his hands in front of himself.

609
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:19,550
Of course, there were small imperfections
that were not detected until those
involved

610
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,279
viewed the developed
and printed film the next day.

611
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,113
Fixing these slight problem areas
was accomplished

612
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,716
by individuals who carefully
retouched the film, frame by frame,

613
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,394
with a very small brush and opaque dye.

614
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,794
According to Fulton, approximately
64,000 frames were retouched in this way.

615
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,394
<i>Until Universal's
The Invisible Man Returns in 1940,</i>

616
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:49,477
there was no attempt to deal with such
spectacular invisibility effects in films.

617
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,154
But, on a somewhat
less spectacular level,

618
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,031
<i>in 1937 producer Hal Roach made
his first of three Topper features.</i>

619
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,317
The story related the humorous
adventures of two ghosts,

620
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,995
husband and wife, played by
Cary Grant and Constance Bennett.

621
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,833
They sometimes appeared
in a transparent mode,

622
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,153
other times they were invisible, and they
often appeared to be completely visible.

623
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,949
<i>Roy Seawright's effects weren't as
elaborate as those in The Invisible Man,</i>

624
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,235
but they were well done.

625
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,197
One of the challenges for John Fulton,

626
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,592
when he was doing his special invisible
shots against a black velvet background,

627
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,672
was matching the lighting
on the visible part of the shots

628
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,151
with the general lighting used by
the cinematographer, Arthur Edeson,

629
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,515
on the normal parts of the production.

630
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,273
<i>The Invisible Man was
the last of five pictures</i>

631
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,828
Arthur Edeson
photographed with James Whale.

632
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,911
The two apparently got along well.

633
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,878
There were never any
arguments or disagreements.

634
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,794
Whale learned a lot from Edeson,
beginning with their first film together,

635
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,348
<i><b>Waterloo Bridge in 1931,</b></i>

636
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,908
<i>and then Frankenstein that same year.</i>

637
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,310
<i>But Edeson moved elsewhere
after The Invisible Man.</i>

638
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,311
One of his major productions soon after

639
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,518
<i><b>was the 1935
Mutiny on the Bounty at MGM.</b></i>

640
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,832
<i>Then there was the classic 1941
Maltese Falcon with Humphrey Bogart,</i>

641
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,756
<i>and he just happened to photograph
a picture called Casablanca in 1942.</i>

642
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,277
Here's John Carradine again.
He was born Richmond Reed Carradine,

643
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,669
but his name was changed
to John Carradine

644
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,594
when he went under contract
to Twentieth Century Fox in 1935.

645
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,555
Arthur Edeson went way back as
a cinematographer, way back to 1914.

646
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,236
He shot some of Douglas Fairbanks
Senior's big productions in the 1920s,

647
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,039
<i><b>including Robin Hood
and The Thief of Bagdad.</b></i>

648
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,999
<i>He did the first version
of The Lost World in 1925.</i>

649
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,995
<i>Edeson and director Lewis Milestone for
All Quiet on the Western Front, in 1930,</i>

650
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,833
liberated the camera
from the cumbersome booths

651
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,550
that had been used to muffle noise when
sound was introduced in the late 1920s.

652
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,030
Believe it or not, there were motion
pictures dealing with invisibility

653
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,714
as far back as 1904.

654
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:07,477
<i>A little number called The Invisible Siva,
a Georges Mélics French production.</i>

655
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,873
Mélics was famous for doing trick films
with the magic executed in the camera.

656
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,080
<i>Another French production,
The Invisible Thief, was done in 1905.</i>

657
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,550
<i>The Invisible Fluid in 1908</i>

658
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,794
bestowed temporary invisibility
on men and inanimate objects.

659
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,351
<i>Then came the British
Invisible Dog in 1910.</i>

660
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,639
<i>The Light Unseen in 1914
featured an invisible scientist.</i>

661
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,670
<i>A 1923 feature picture directed by
Roland West called The Unknown Purple</i>

662
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,399
has an inventor,
played by Henry B Walthall,

663
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,598
discovering a purple light
that renders the user invisible.

664
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,357
He utilises the light to revenge himself
against those who framed him for theft.

665
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,955
<i>And in 1933, the same year
The Invisible Man was made,</i>

666
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,034
<i>there was a German film called The
Invisible Man Goes Through the City.</i>

667
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,795
Even animated cartoons
tried the invisible man theme.

668
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,032
One example is a 1939
Warner Brothers Looney Tunes

669
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:17,399
<i>called Porky's Movie Mystery,
featuring Porky Pig as Mr Motto.</i>

670
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,998
No, not Mr Moto. He's a detective
trying to track down the invisible man,

671
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,878
who is creating problems
at the film studio.

672
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,076
Finally, the character becomes visible,

673
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,833
and is revealed to be
the caricatured image

674
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,629
of Warner comedian of the time,
Hugh Herbert.

675
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,871
The above rundown of films
constitutes only some examples,

676
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,236
not a definitive and complete listing.

677
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,596
<i>Before and after
the 1933 Invisible Man film,</i>

678
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:50,312
there were various features,
serials, TV versions, even commercials.

679
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,555
Whale's biographer, James Curtis,

680
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,112
many years ago interviewed Ted Kent, the
film editor on nine of the director's films,

681
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,077
<i>including The Invisible Man.</i>

682
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,277
Recalling Whale's working methods,
Kent talked about

683
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:08,638
Whale wanting to maintain control
over all aspects of the productions.

684
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,238
In scripts, for example, he would point
out where close-ups were to be used.

685
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:18,438
Then at the back of his scripts
he would make suggested illustrations

686
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,398
for the art and costume departments.

687
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,470
Apparently, in creative areas,
it was difficult for Whale to delegate.

688
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,517
This is the first
of only two scenes in the entire film

689
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,717
between the invisible man
and his beloved Flora.

690
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,268
In part, it is a very poignant scene.

691
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,399
Griffin displays genuine tenderness
toward his inamorata.

692
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,596
You have the feeling that his love for Flora

693
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,229
has temporarily held in check
his maniacal behaviour

694
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,550
from the effects of the monocane drug.

695
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,837
Griffin's vocal delivery
reflects his momentary change

696
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:08,438
back to what was surely his personality
prior to the nefarious experiment.

697
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,513
After some devoted, touching
comments by Griffin, Flora asks:

698
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,079
<i>- Why did you do this?
- For you, Flora.</i>

699
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,754
<i>- For me?
- Yes, for you, my darling.</i>

700
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,831
<i>I wanted to do something tremendous,</i>

701
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,515
<i>to achieve what men of science
have dreamt of since the world began,</i>

702
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,318
<i>to gain wealth and fame and honour,</i>

703
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,439
<i>to write my name above
the greatest scientists of all time.</i>

704
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,672
<i>I was so pitifully poor.
I had nothing to offer you, Flora.</i>

705
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,233
<i>I was just a poor, struggling chemist.</i>

706
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,073
<i>I shall come back to you,
Flora, very soon now.</i>

707
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,993
<i>The secret of invisibility
lies there in my books.</i>

708
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,072
<i>I shall work in Kemp's laboratory
till I find the way back.</i>

709
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,596
<i>There is a way back, Flora.
And then I shall come to you.</i>

710
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,593
<i>I shall offer my secret to the world,
with all its terrible power!</i>

711
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,592
<i>The nations of the world will bid for it -
thousands, millions.</i>

712
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,435
<i>The nation that wins my secret can
sweep the world with invisible armies!</i>

713
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,836
Obviously the monocane
is fighting to regain its power,

714
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,229
and it succeeds.

715
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,835
Gloria Stuart has given many interviews
regarding her reactions

716
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,992
to playing scenes
in this film with Claude Rains.

717
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,390
She found him rather distant,
self-absorbed

718
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,040
and prone to upstaging her
in front of the camera.

719
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,395
But Whale intervened.

720
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,110
All in all, she did not find working with
Claude to be an enjoyable experience.

721
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,231
Actor Peter Lorre told an amusing story
about a joke played on Claude

722
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,278
<i>that took place
when they were filming Casablanca.</i>

723
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:44,117
"Claude was constantly studying, making
sure he had each line letter-perfect."

724
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,954
"One day we wrote a scene which
had nothing to do with the script,

725
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,113
and asked all the actors to memorise it,
except Claude, of course."

726
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,751
"When he came in the next day and saw
us rehearsing the scene, he was frantic."

727
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,753
"He called me aside and said 'Peter,
something terrible has happened to me."'

728
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:05,709
"'I can't remember a single line.' We all
broke up, and he wasn't even mad,

729
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,509
just relieved that
his memory wasn't failing."

730
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,789
<i>Gloria Stuart was playing in The Seagull
at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1932</i>

731
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,429
when Phil Friedman,
then Universal's casting director,

732
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,795
saw her and asked her to make a test.

733
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,350
A contract followed.
In addition to her films at Universal,

734
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,510
including three with James Whale,

735
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,795
she was loaned for various pictures,

736
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,350
<i>including Here Comes the Navy
with James Cagney and Pat O'Brien,</i>

737
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,591
<i>and Gold Diggers of 1935
with Dick Powell.</i>

738
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:42,035
One day Universal's production chief,
Carl Laemmle Junior, asked to see her.

739
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,432
Gloria recalled
"Junior was sitting behind his desk."

740
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,990
"'Sit down, Gloria.
We have a wonderful idea for you."'

741
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:54,198
"'We're going
to make you a female Tarzan!"'

742
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,593
"I guess it was a count of one, two,
three, then I really started screaming!"

743
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,512
She then went under contract
to Twentieth Century Fox,

744
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,229
<i>and was featured in such films
as The Prisoner of Shark Island,</i>

745
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,311
<i>and two films with Shirley Temple,
Poor Little Rich Girl</i>

746
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,358
<i>and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.</i>

747
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,399
When she tried to make the move from
screen to Broadway in the 1940s,

748
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:23,316
"I never made it. It was years
and years of disappointment."

749
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:29,957
Her second husband, screenwriter Arthur
Sheekman, convinced her to stop trying.

750
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,510
In 1983 she learned printing
from Ward Ritchie,

751
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,151
a master printer and book designer
she had met back in 1930.

752
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,394
Both were widowed. Soon she was
creating artists' books in limited editions.

753
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,756
Ritchie was her companion
until his death in 1996.

754
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:51,439
When director James Cameron
selected the 86-year-old Gloria

755
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:58,039
<i>for a leading role in Titanic in 1996,
yet another phase of her careers began.</i>

756
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:04,590
<i>Since Titanic, she has appeared in other
films and is still going strong aged 90.</i>

757
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,511
Clearly, RC Sherriffs screenplay stayed
reasonably close to HG Wells' novel.

758
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,160
But what about those various treatments

759
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:20,792
and 11 scripts prepared by 12 different
writers that preceded Sherriffs version?

760
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,431
<i>Garrett Fort, who had worked on the
scripts for both Dracula and Frankenstein,</i>

761
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,469
started the parade with
a screenplay dated April 9, 1932.

762
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,755
He worked with Robert Florey,
who at that time

763
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,115
<i>was slated to direct The Invisible Man.</i>

764
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,192
But the script
was not based on Wells's book,

765
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,832
<i>but rather on Philip Wylie's 1931 novel,
The Murderer Invisible,</i>

766
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,718
that Universal had recently purchased.

767
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:52,397
Wylie's novel was set in contemporary
times in New York and New Jersey.

768
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,917
It dealt with a research scientist,
prior to disappearing himself,

769
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,790
experimenting and making an octopus
invisible in his laboratory tank.

770
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,270
With his own invisibility
comes megalomania.

771
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:10,558
He wreaks havoc on New York City
by blowing up Grand Central station,

772
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,200
among other major acts.

773
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,673
His plans are thwarted as he is about
to place invisible cholera bacteria

774
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:24,039
into New York's water supply that
no microscope would be able to detect.

775
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,715
Then the heroine crashes
a bottle of ink on his skull.

776
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,031
The bottle breaks,
and the ink deluges him,

777
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,271
making him visible and
an easy target for the police.

778
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,997
The early scripts were
quite faithful to Wylie's novel,

779
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,993
except that Garrett Fort modified
the invisible cholera

780
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,516
to invisible rats carrying bubonic plague.

781
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,397
But the invisible one is killed,
along with the rats,

782
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,917
by the police showering
his refuge with chlorine gas.

783
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,912
John I Balderston,
who had worked on the play versions

784
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,991
<i>of Dracula and Frankenstein,</i>

785
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,311
<i>as well as the screenplay
of Universal's The Mummy,</i>

786
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,439
wrote several drafts of the script
based on Garrett Fort's adaptation

787
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:12,556
<i>of The Murderer Invisible.</i>

788
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,509
A later draft of Balderston's was done
with the collaboration of Cyril Gardner,

789
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,592
who for a while
was going to direct the film.

790
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,036
Through the long gestation period,

791
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:27,671
<i>various directors were announced
by Universal to do The Invisible Man.</i>

792
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,830
In addition to Gardner and Florey,

793
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,151
James Whale was to be
on the project at different times.

794
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,199
Even EA Dupont, the German director.

795
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,790
Since HG Wells
supposedly had script approval,

796
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:46,874
it seems unlikely that Universal would
send versions based on another novel

797
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,829
<i>but still titled The Invisible Man,
not The Murderer Invisible.</i>

798
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,279
Perhaps these were considered
experimental drafts and not sent to Wells.

799
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,351
A puzzlement.

800
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,958
The train setting is a miniature
on a three-quarter-inch scale,

801
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,068
created for this film by Charlie Baker
and his miniature unit at Universal.

802
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,188
John Fulton and Baker
worked as a team at the studio.

803
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,319
The crash coming up
is very well executed in all respects.

804
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,755
Universal got a lot of mileage
out of this scene,

805
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,638
as it was recycled
for other features and serials,

806
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,316
<i>one example being the 1942 feature
Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror,</i>

807
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,233
with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.

808
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,233
<i>Philip Wylie, author of
The Murderer Invisible novel,</i>

809
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,630
was a prolific writer
who worked in various genres.

810
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:57,633
<i>Science fiction buffs know
such books as his When Worlds Collide</i>

811
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,871
<i>and After Worlds Collide,
among many others.</i>

812
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,236
<i>At the time The Invisible Man
was being prepared and filmed,</i>

813
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,110
Wylie was at Paramount working on
the screenplay of another HG Wells book,

814
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,077
<i>The Island of Dr Moreau.</i>

815
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,073
<i>The title was changed
to The Island of Lost Souls.</i>

816
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,596
<i>In addition, he contributed
to the scripts of Murders in the Zoo</i>

817
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,639
<i>and King of the Jungle
at Paramount during 1933.</i>

818
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:33,914
The reporter asking the questions
is played by Dwight Frye.

819
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,278
<i>We think of such characterisations
as the crazed Renfield in Dracula,</i>

820
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:44,435
<i>as the hunchback Fritz, Frankenstein's
loony assistant in the 1931 Frankenstein</i>

821
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,114
<i><b>and a similar role
in Bride of Frankenstein.</b></i>

822
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:52,115
But here, his brief appearance
is one of complete normality.

823
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:57,274
Before coming to Hollywood in 1930, he
had an impressive career in the theatre.

824
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,113
Frye was in six of James Whale's films.

825
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,030
<i>Moving on with the saga of
the evolving Invisible Man screenplays...</i>

826
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,037
New approaches included
a treatment by Richard Schayer,

827
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,954
which has a scientist render
his mutilated assistant invisible

828
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,033
and later stand trial for a murder
committed by the assistant.

829
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,395
Preston Sturges contributed a script

830
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,758
that had a doctor treating his maniacal
assistant with an invisibility drug,

831
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,718
following which the two journey to Russia

832
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:32,874
to avenge the killing of the scientist's
relatives during the revolution.

833
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,033
James Whale decided to do
a six-page treatment of his own.

834
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,998
The approach presents
the invisible man as a scientist

835
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:45,598
who was able to make himself invisible
to obliterate a ghastly disfigurement.

836
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,959
But he too has a mind alteration
afterwards and goes on a killing spree.

837
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,636
Gouverneur Morris wrote a screenplay
based on Whale's six-page treatment.

838
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:01,909
For this version, Philip Wylie's invisible
octopus had a return engagement.

839
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,709
Apparently, Laird Doyle did a script
and John Weld, we are told,

840
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,999
wrote a treatment and screenplay that
were actually based on HG Wells' novel.

841
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,993
He was replaced by
British playwright RC Sherriff,

842
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,799
<i>whose very successful
play Journey's End</i>

843
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,668
had been directed by James Whale
on the stage and screen.

844
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,673
The actor playing
the chief of detectives is Dudley Digges,

845
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,638
another Irish-born actor
who made his stage debut

846
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,029
with the Abbey Theatre Players in Dublin,

847
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:37,069
and first performed
in the US in New York in 1904.

848
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,879
In 1911, he became stage manager

849
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:44,272
for the distinguished actor
George Arliss, for seven years.

850
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:50,151
And from 1919 to 1930, Digges appeared
in many Theatre Guild productions,

851
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,038
and staged or produced several plays.

852
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,511
<i>In 1923 he produced George Bernard
Shaw's The Doctor's Dilemma,</i>

853
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,592
which featured Claude Rains.

854
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:06,915
Later, Rains relieved Digges the actor in
two plays with extended runs and tours.

855
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,870
Digges, starting in 1929,
appeared in many films,

856
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,556
<i>including the first version
of The Maltese Falcon in 1931,</i>

857
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:21,431
as Casper Gutman, Sydney Greenstreet's
role in the 1941 Bogart version.

858
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,556
Other notable screen credits include

859
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,079
<i><b>the 1935 Clark Gable, Charles Laughton
Mutiny on the Bounty,</b></i>

860
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:33,154
<i>The General Died at Dawn, The Light
That Failed, Son of Fury, et cetera.</i>

861
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,834
He died in 1947.

862
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,676
RC Sherriff, in his 1968 autobiography,

863
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,797
described some of
the rejected adaptations he had read

864
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,791
prior to starting his own.

865
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:53,113
He mentioned that one turned
the invisible man "into a man from Mars,

866
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,716
who threatened to flood the world
with invisible Martians".

867
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,873
That particular approach
has not shown up as of now.

868
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,748
Perhaps this was
the elusive John Huston treatment,

869
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,195
written in the summer of 1932

870
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:11,158
when he was under contract
to Universal as a writer.

871
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,153
Or, perhaps Sherriff, in retrospect,
was confusing this with a project

872
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,312
that he and Whale were working on
at the time for Universal

873
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,597
<i>called A Trip to Mars,
which was never made.</i>

874
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,192
Sherriff reread HG Wells'
novel after many years,

875
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,431
and wondered why so many
writers of the previous scripts

876
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,751
had chosen to ignore
what Universal had purchased.

877
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,709
With Whale in agreement, Sherriff
did a dramatically sound adaptation.

878
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,598
Said Sherriff in his autobiography

879
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,313
"To give reality
to a fantastic story, HG Wells knew

880
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:50,632
it had to be told through the eyes
of ordinary, plain-spoken people."

881
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,076
"A screenplay, to my way of thinking,

882
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:56,994
lay about halfway
between a stage play and a novel."

883
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,913
"You were free from
the narrow boundaries of the stage,

884
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,516
but you had to keep from wandering
down the bylanes open to the novelist."

885
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,752
"I had to add ingredients here
and there to tighten up the drama."

886
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:14,079
Historian Paul Jensen was
the first to research and write

887
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,835
<i>an in-depth study
of The Invisible Man, many years ago.</i>

888
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,957
He pointed out that
some of the changes Sherriff made,

889
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,828
such as adding Flora and her father,
expanding Kemp's role,

890
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,876
and making him a romantic rival,

891
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,428
presented an interesting parallel.

892
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:35,755
<i>Jensen wrote "The model for these added
aspects was probably Frankenstein."</i>

893
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,753
"The two films share the situation
of a passionate young scientist

894
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,276
who has disappeared
in order to experiment alone,

895
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:47,399
leaving behind a worried fiancée,
a fatherly associate -

896
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,917
Dr Cranley here becomes Dr Waldman,
and Baron Frankenstein -

897
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,560
and a friend who is fond of the fiancée."

898
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,396
"By increasing Kemp's importance,

899
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,917
Sherriff and Whale provide Griffin
with a specific antagonist,

900
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,710
thereby creating a more precise conflict
than exists in the novel."

901
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,759
<i>"Such a conflict is dramatically necessary
in The Invisible Man,</i>

902
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,799
because there is no overt struggle
between the scientist and a monster,

903
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,313
<i>as in Frankenstein."</i>

904
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,474
"Here, the scientist himself
becomes the monster."

905
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,477
RC Sherriff, Robert Cedric Sherriff,

906
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:30,315
was born in Kingston-upon-Thames,
Surrey, England, in 1896.

907
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,278
He worked with Whale
on two other films at Universal,

908
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,396
<i><b>One More River and The Road Back.</b></i>

909
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,994
<i>He also wrote the unproduced version
of Dracula's Daughter</i>

910
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,514
that Whale was originally set to direct.

911
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,028
In 1939 he wrote the excellent script

912
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,715
<i>for Korda's Technicolor production
of The Four Feathers.</i>

913
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,509
<i>Other credits include
the Robert Donat Goodbye, Mr Chips,</i>

914
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,876
<i>That Hamilton Woman with
Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh,</i>

915
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,396
<i>and Odd Man Out with James Mason.</i>

916
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,710
He died in 1975.

917
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,754
Kemp's car going over the cliff
was another of Charlie Baker's,

918
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,479
and his Universal
miniature department's efforts.

919
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,074
As usual, a first-rate one.

920
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,311
This scene was also reprised
in other Universal films,

921
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,437
<i>including Jungle Woman in 1944</i>

922
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,317
<i>and a 1945 Sherlock Holmes entry,
The House of Fear.</i>

923
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,757
The British actor playing
the chief of police is Holmes Herbert.

924
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:55,278
This policeman is played
by Monte Montague, an American,

925
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,032
who speaks here with a British accent.

926
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,680
He was an actor
and stunt man for decades.

927
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,110
After a long absence,
since the main title, actually,

928
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,239
music returns as underscoring
for the last seven minutes of the film.

929
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,110
Composer Heinz Roemheld
also did original scores

930
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,192
for two other Universal
horror films at the time,

931
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:20,434
<i><b>The Black Cat in 1934
and Dracula's Daughter in 1936.</b></i>

932
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,440
In case the score
sounds somewhat familiar,

933
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,432
but you can't quite
place where else you heard it,

934
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:32,389
<i><b>how about trying Universal's 1930s
Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers serials</b></i>

935
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,436
with Buster Crabbe?

936
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,035
The music you're hearing
provided a perfect accompaniment

937
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:43,194
to the intrepid interplanetary adventures
of Flash, Dale and Dr Zarkov.

938
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,239
<i>And The Invisible Man main title music
was put into service</i>

939
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,949
whenever a rocket ship
in those serials raced here and there.

940
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,389
The farmer is Robert Browner,

941
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,155
who goes back to 1909 as a film actor.

942
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:04,597
<i>Although The Invisible Man was always
thought to be Claude Rains' first film,</i>

943
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,478
it was confirmed recently
that he had a supporting role

944
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:13,112
<i><b>in a silent British feature production
of 1920 called Build Thy House,</b></i>

945
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,839
which apparently is a lost film.

946
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,833
But based on items in the files
of the British Film Institute

947
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,672
Rains was eighth billed

948
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,799
and played a drunken loafer who,
while applying for a job,

949
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:30,715
gives some revealing and dramatic
information about the leading character.

950
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:36,113
<i>After his success in The Invisible Man,
Rains did two more pictures for Universal:</i>

951
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,398
<i>The Man Who Reclaimed his Head,
which he had done earlier on the stage,</i>

952
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,510
<i>and The Mystery of Edwin Drood, based
on Charles Dickens's unfinished novel.</i>

953
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:52,038
<i><b>And Whale thought of him for the role
of Dr Pretorius in Bride of Frankenstein,</b></i>

954
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:55,237
but we know
that Ernest Thesiger played that part.

955
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:58,676
In 1936 he signed with Warner Brothers.

956
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:03,914
It was unusual in that he was paid
only when actually working on a picture.

957
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,719
When Rains finished shooting,
he would head immediately

958
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,268
for his beloved farm in Pennsylvania.

959
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,954
Also, his deal was non-exclusive.

960
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:16,158
<i>He played the villainous Prince John
in 1938's The Adventures of Robin Hood,</i>

961
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,912
photographed in Technicolor.

962
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,992
He was nominated for
an Academy Award for his performance

963
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:27,110
<i>as the suave but corrupt senator in Frank
Capra's Mr Smith Goes to Washington.</i>

964
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,079
<i>Then he returned to Universal
to be top billed in The Wolf Man.</i>

965
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,879
No, he wasn't the wolf man, but his father.

966
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:40,031
Rains played the title role in Universal's
opulent 1943 Technicolor remake

967
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,429
<i>of The Phantom of the Opera.</i>

968
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,192
<i>There followed Now, Voyager,</i>

969
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,990
<i>Casablanca, for which he won his second
best supporting actor nomination,</i>

970
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:52,550
<i>and Mr Skeffington,
yet another Oscar nomination.</i>

971
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,154
<i>Rains gave one of his finest performances
in Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious,</i>

972
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:02,119
for which he was
Academy-nominated for the fourth time.

973
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,078
The eminent George Bernard Shaw
personally chose him

974
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,390
to star opposite Vivien Leigh

975
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:12,873
<i>in the British production of Shaw's
Caesar and Cleopatra, released in 1946.</i>

976
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,555
<i>He also did another HG Wells story,
The Passionate Friends,</i>

977
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:20,269
<i>released in America as
One Woman's Story in 1949.</i>

978
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,874
It was directed by David Lean.

979
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,875
John Fulton described how the footprints
in the snow coming up were done.

980
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,589
"We dug a trench along the line
where we wanted the footprints,

981
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,753
and covered the trench with a board
in which the footprints had been cut."

982
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:39,196
"The footprint openings
were filled with wooden outlines,

983
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,555
which had been cut
to make the footprints."

984
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:45,315
"These were supported by pegs
extended to the bottom of the trench,

985
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,595
and a rope was looped around the pegs

986
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,513
so that pulling upon it
would pull out the pegs,

987
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:56,038
causing the snow to drop down through
the holes, giving us perfect footprints."

988
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,953
Those footprints look like
shoe prints to me,

989
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,270
but if he had shoes on, the shoes,
of course, would be visible.

990
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,876
What do you think? Dramatic licence?

991
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,918
The doctor here
is British actor Jameson Thomas.

992
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,879
Film buffs may recall his role
as Claudette Colbert's fiancé,

993
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,192
<i>until she ran off with Clark Gable,
in It Happened One Night.</i>

994
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,477
During the late 1950s and early 1960s,

995
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,030
Claude Rains appeared
in many prestige TV productions,

996
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:27,430
including several Alfred Hitchcock shows.

997
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:32,196
<i>He had a role in the epic big-screen
Lawrence of Arabia in 1962,</i>

998
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:37,957
<i>and his final film was
The Greatest Story Ever Told in 1965.</i>

999
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:42,352
Rains died in 1967 at the age of 77.

1000
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,909
In all, Universal made seven films

1001
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,072
in which an invisible man
or woman appeared.

1002
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,230
Invisibility-effects highlights
from the group

1003
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:57,997
appear as part of the video documentary
included on this special-edition DVD.

1005
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,310
Once again, John Fulton describes
how he accomplished

1006
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:09,793
the gradual revealment
of Jack Griffin in peace in death.

1007
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,835
"This was done directly in the camera."

1008
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,629
"The pillow, the indentation and all,
was made of plaster,

1009
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,996
and the blankets
and sheets of papier-mâché."

1010
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:29,232
"A long, slow lap dissolve revealed
the skeleton" - a real one, by the way.

1011
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:34,110
"Another lap dissolve replaced the
skeleton with a roughly-sculpted dummy,

1012
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,873
which suggested
the contours of the actor."

1013
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,715
"A further series of dissolves, each time
using a slightly more finished dummy,

1014
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,429
brought us to the real actor himself."

1015
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,308
Audiences finally get to see
what Claude Rains looks like.

1016
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:54,269
In marketing, Universal decided to
emphasise the novelty aspect of the film,

1017
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,711
rather than sell it as a horror film.

1018
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:01,669
The studio also stressed what was
called at the time "feminine interest".

1019
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,595
My favourite catch line is
"Though he was invisible, she loved him."

1020
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,956
<i>The Invisible Man was a big success,
critically and commercially,</i>

1021
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,670
and a major factor in putting Universal
in the black for the first time in two years.

1022
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:18,150
Remember, this was the worst of times
for the Great Depression.

1023
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,231
This is Rudy Behlmer speaking.
