00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,469
Go on. I ain't got nothin'. Psst!

4
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,432
Sweet Jesus!

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,434
Oh, God! No! No! No!

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,276
<i>(man) Yeah,
this is definitely our campsite.</i>

8
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,359
- So...
- So we're here. Come on.

9
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,431
Can you help me with this?

10
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,197
Here. Over there, by the fire pit.

11
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,238
- Oh, here, here, here, here.
- Oh, yeah. You need that.

12
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,311
Need the hatchet.

13
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,910
- Thank you for doing this.
- I was made for camping.

14
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,956
- This is, like, my thing.
- Hm-hm.

15
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,634
- What? Oh, really?
- Hm-hm.

16
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,716
- You know what?
- What?

17
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,234
- I think I'm gonna like camping.
- Yeah?

18
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,311
- Hm-hm.
- I told you.

19
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,831
Ow! Wait a minute.

20
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,678
- Did you get the bug stuff?
- Come on. Let's get this tent up.

21
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,751
Come on.

22
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,868
Shit, shit, shit.

23
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,150
- The engine's fucking destroyed.
- This ain't how you talked it, D.

24
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,074
Mexico is just around the corner,
sweetheart. Come on.

25
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,832
It's not.

26
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,833
Well, this truck ain't getting us
any closer, alright? Let's go.

27
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,033
- Mine's in.
- It can't be. I... Hold on.

28
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,680
- Well, just hold that. Just trust me.
- OK.

29
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,479
- Hey, got it.
- OK, mine's in.

30
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,028
Ow! Well, now mine's not.

31
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,792
- Are you OK?
- This is...

32
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,270
- Are you sure you got the right hole?
- OK, is this the right pole?

33
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,069
- Look how short that pole is.
- Yeah, it's... Yeah.

34
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,754
I'm starting to think
we're not wilderness people.

35
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,276
Of course we are.
We can't let this tent beat us, OK?

36
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,909
You always say we have to be smarter
than what we're working against.

37
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,594
You know what I'm definitely
smarter than? A motel.

38
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,911
No. You can't see the stars
from a motel. And that wasn't the deal.

39
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,629
The deal was anniversary sex
under the stars.

40
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,199
OK, that part sounds kind of familiar.

41
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,590
Alright, hold your end.
I'll get this in.

42
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,271
- OK.
- You ready? You got it?

43
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,554
OK.

44
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,589
Oh!

45
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,711
Are you kidding me?

46
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,950
Tell me you remembered the spare tent.

47
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,955
<i>No. (laughs)</i>

48
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,600
Come here. Come here.

49
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,911
Motel. Motel. Motel.

50
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,231
Come on. Come on!

51
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,037
OK.

52
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,474
What are you doing?

53
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,308
Hey, D. That's all our stuff.

54
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,712
We're getting all new stuff, baby.
All new stuff.

55
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,598
Hey, who's the cowgirl, huh?

56
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,148
I fucking hate it when you call me that.

57
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,156
Hey, there's my cowgirl. There she is.

58
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,639
Let's go.

59
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,838
Just gotta hang on a little while
longer. We're almost fucking there.

60
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,034
Who's my lady Lacey, huh?

61
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,558
There you are, baby. Just gotta hang on
a little while fucking longer, alright?

62
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,556
- Do you realise how old this forest is?
- No. Please tell me.

63
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,351
The whole area mostly sucks for logging,
so these trees are completely untouched.

64
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,829
Some of them are 400 years old,
maybe more.

65
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,151
- Really?
- They just grow older and older.

66
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,472
You know, if you spent half as much time
in nature as you do reading about it,

67
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,677
we'd be cuddling
under the stars tonight.

68
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,751
Cuddling.

69
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,631
Hey, come on.

70
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,350
Now we get to spend our anniversary
basking in the glow of free cable TV.

71
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,716
Next year we're camping.

72
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,313
- Alright.
- OK.

73
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,954
See that tree right there? That's a post
oak, a 300-year-old tree at least.

74
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,838
Baby, could we please
just have a moment of silence,

75
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,559
you know, to mourn the loss of our tent?

76
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,757
OK. Look at the positives here
for two seconds. Just go with me.

77
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,195
- OK.
- We get to stay at a ghetto-ass motel.

78
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,590
There's gonna be bugs everywhere.
The AC will probably be broken.

79
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,309
It's gonna be every bit as uncomfortable
as sleeping in the wilderness.

80
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,870
- So why are you complaining?
- Will there be holes in the sheets?

81
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,520
We won't stop
until we find a place that does.

82
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,229
- Or I'll poke holes in them myself.
- I love you.

83
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,350
Oh! Look at that tree. That's gotta be
at least 400 years old, right?

84
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,954
- Look how big that one is.
- That's an old tree.

85
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,158
I'd say closer to 100 or 200.
See it has stumps halfway up?

86
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,312
You're gonna laugh at me?
You're gonna laugh at me when I'm...

87
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,472
I think you're cute.
It's adorable when you talk about trees.

88
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,154
I'm not gonna talk about 'em any more.

89
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,314
<i>(woman) What the?</i>

90
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,949
Did you?

91
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,832
- What's she doing out here by herself?
- She looks... not right.

92
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,155
- Well, what do you wanna do?
- Hm.

93
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,516
- She's coming up here.
- I don't know. I think it's weird.

94
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,795
<i>- It's OK. (whispers) Go.
- Maybe he's with her.</i>

95
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,518
- No, thank you.
- I don't know.

96
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,750
- Oh, my God, Seth.
- Are you fucking deaf?

97
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,438
- Whoa, whoa!
- Out of the fucking car now. Out.

98
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,875
- Baby, no!
- We're good, baby. We're good.

99
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,952
<i>- (alarm pings)
- Turn it off. Get out of the car.</i>

100
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,918
Nice and easy, alright?
Get out of the car.

101
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,913
- Just... Just...
- Get out of the fucking car now!

102
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,955
- Oh, God!
- OK, OK.

103
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,917
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, yeah.

104
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,434
Clear the back seat.
Make room for two more.

105
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,273
No, D, you can't change the plan.
You said no hostages.

106
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,113
I know what I said, baby.
I know what I said. Listen to me.

107
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,634
Plat's 40 miles up the road.

108
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,030
The bank's closed. It don't open
till 8am. Listen to me. Trust me.

109
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,112
We're gonna do this right.
Come here. Come here.

110
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,397
Listen to me. You gotta trust me, OK?
You trust me? You trust me?

111
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,948
OK, give me a kiss.

112
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,992
OK, go get in the front seat.
Let's go, kid.

113
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,111
That's twice.

114
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,191
OK.

115
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,033
- Up.
- Oh, God. God.

116
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,554
- You, around the front. Drive.
- I can drive.

117
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,871
- I wasn't talking to you. Drive.
- What? I can't...

118
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,918
- Drive the fucking car!
- I can't drive stick, OK?

119
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,869
Fuck! Get in the fucking car.

120
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,157
Hands on the wheel,
off the fucking locks.

121
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,959
You, in back, over here.
Lacey's up front.

122
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,395
Go on. Step in there, Lacey.

123
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,072
Get in the fucking car.

124
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,720
Everybody nice and fucking comfy now?

125
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,755
- You OK, baby?
- Yeah. I'm cold.

126
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,674
OK, OK. Just relax, just relax.
Let's go.

127
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,238
- OK, OK.
- What's the problem? Yeah? OK?

128
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,311
OK. Uh-uh.

129
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,870
Wallets and cellphone, give 'em up.

130
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,038
- Same page, friend?
- Seth, just give him the damn thing.

131
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,714
Yeah, just give it to me, Seth.

132
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,958
Jesus. Five bucks?
Don't anybody carry cash any more?

133
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,996
Here, baby. Take that. See if you can
find anything for you in there.

134
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,438
Seth Turner. Polly Watt.

135
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,752
Same address, different names.
Hm. Not married?

136
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,437
- Living together in sin?
- Come on, Dennis.

137
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,715
That ain't your business, now.

138
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,150
Student ID. A little old, ain't you?

139
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,389
- It's a PhD.
- Oh.

140
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,153
- You a doctor?
- Not yet, no.

141
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,438
- But you can do script, huh?
- What?

142
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:28,117
- Can you write prescriptions?
- No. No, it's a biology PhD.

143
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,998
- Lacey.
- OK. Then you ain't a fucking doctor.

144
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,432
Great.

145
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,078
Not yet.

146
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,390
Where are we going?

147
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,076
Just drive till I say different.
This is a dictatorship from here on out.

148
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,469
If you wanna make life easy,
don't talk no more.

149
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,519
<i>- (gasps)
- Shit, what was that?</i>

150
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,192
- We hit something.
- What?

151
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,669
Ginger. Ginger.

152
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,638
- Ginger? Ginger's dead, baby.
- We've got a flat tyre.

153
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,190
- What the fuck are you trying to do?
- Relax, Lacey. It's gonna be fine.

154
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,750
- Get the spare. You.
- Er...

155
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,435
- Get the spare!
- I'll get it. It's not his car.

156
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,273
It's not my car.

157
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,911
You know, you suffer from
a severe case of CDS. Can't do shit.

158
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,312
You think Ginger's OK?
She's just a puppy. Huh?

159
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,230
Hurry up.

160
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,033
Here. Hey, if he moves, shoot him.

161
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,400
Hey, let's go.

162
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,991
OK.

163
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,271
Go.

164
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,029
Ginger.

165
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,951
Ginger.

166
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,998
OK. It's OK.

167
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,833
Momma's here now.
It's gonna be OK, Ginger.

168
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,718
OK. You... You gotta help her.

169
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,119
- Please.
- You...

170
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,715
- Come on, Biology. Ginger needs you.
- OK. I'm...

171
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,677
I'm pretty sure it's dead.

172
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,517
Here, make this quick. Fit this tyre.

173
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,031
Grab that.

174
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,354
Ah! Damn.

175
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,151
What the?

176
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,636
You're gonna help her.

177
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,711
- Come on.
- OK. OK.

178
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,274
OK.

179
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,869
It's OK. No, it's OK, lovely.
He's a doctor.

180
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,034
I don't care what Dennis says, OK, baby?

181
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,476
We're gonna take you home, OK?
We're gonna save you.

182
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,677
What is wrong with her?

183
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,319
<i>(squelching)</i>

184
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,834
- I don't know what...
- Hey, fix it.

185
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,671
Alright. Alright.

186
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,517
See these? I don't...

187
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,710
What is that?

188
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,198
Holy shit! Holy motherfucker!

189
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,311
- Seth!
- Get that thing on the ground. Lacey!

190
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,914
- Baby.
- What happened? You OK? Talk to me.

191
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,754
- Shut up!
- Talk to me. Talk to me, Lacey.

192
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,711
<i>- Lacey.
- (Lacey) Get in. Get in!</i>

193
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,268
- Did he mess with you?
- Get in! D, get in.

194
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,429
- Get in the car.
- Seth! Seth!

195
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,112
Ah, fuck!

196
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,228
- What happened?
- We gotta get out of here.

197
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,515
- Drive this fucking car!
- What happened?

198
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,716
- I'm not leaving him.
- Oh, fuck! Drive!

199
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,997
- I'm not leaving him.
- Fuck! Come on. Go!

200
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,197
Go, go. OK. Go, go! Drive!

201
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,510
Speed up.

202
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,558
I will blow a hole in you
big enough to watch TV through.

203
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,677
- Fucking stop!
- Tell me what's happened, Lace.

204
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,228
What happened back there, hm?

205
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,959
She tried to get me.

206
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,031
- Who?
- Ginger.

207
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,516
- She attacked me with her tail.
- It wasn't Ginger, baby.

208
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,956
- Yeah.
- It was some critter from the woods.

209
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,829
Ginger's dead, sweetheart.

210
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,909
You gotta let her go.

211
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,150
God.

212
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,478
Did you see anything back there?

213
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,956
When was the last time
you took a hit, Lace? Huh?

214
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,477
- It's not that, D.
- Tell me.

215
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,790
D, I swear to God, it's not that.

216
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,032
Hey, I saw some crazy shit.
First two days, I saw shit coming...

217
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,634
Baby, it's not that.

218
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,235
OK? I ain't had a hit
since day before yesterday.

219
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,629
I ain't seeing a goddamn thing.

220
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,917
She tried to get you with her tail, huh?

221
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,956
Fine. I'm gonna straighten you out.

222
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,919
I promise you, if that's the last thing
I do, I'm gonna straighten you out.

223
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,231
I'm gonna get you to Mexico, get you
drinks with fucking umbrellas in 'em.

224
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,518
Motherfuckin' radiator. Fuck!

225
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,589
One sure thing about luck is,
it will change.

226
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,349
Pull over.

227
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,515
- Hey, where are you going?
- Bathroom.

228
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,160
Just hold it.
It's only 30 miles to Platt.

229
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,639
I need to go.

230
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,154
You told me
you were gonna lay off the stuff.

231
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,515
And you told me fuckin' Mexico.

232
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,353
I just don't want you
getting cockeyed on me.

233
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,718
This whole fucking world is cockeyed.
I'm not gonna make a fuckin' difference.

234
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,791
Leave it.

235
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,755
<i>- Turn it off.
- (engine stops)</i>

236
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,909
Tell me you can pump gas.

237
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,588
Let's go. Polly Watt,
we're going to buy coolant and crackers.

238
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,549
Keep a cool hand, Luke.

239
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,711
Hello?

240
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,631
Come on, come on. Fucking... Come on.

241
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,119
Come on.

242
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,436
OK. Come on, you fucking door!

243
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,317
Fuck!

244
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,711
Hello?

245

<i>(rings bell)</i>

They're making this easy, huh?

250

Fuck!

251
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,240
- Sorry. I didn't...
- Kill me.

252
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,030
Baby? Baby! Baby!

253
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,317
- What's going on?
- There's a man with spikes.

254
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,835
- Spikes?
- No, no, no, no, baby, please.

255
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,434
- Just listen!
- Do you even hear yourself talking?

256
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,593
Baby, in the bathroom, there's a man!
He's fucking...

00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,629
What the fuck?

Lacey, get back. Lacey, get back!

Lacey!

261
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,478
Fuck!

Get inside!

- Lacey!
- Are you OK? What was that?

266
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,196
- It just tore right through her.
- Oh, shit! Lacey!

267
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,830
- What are you doing?
- Calling for help.

268
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,117
No, no, no, no! What are you doing?

269
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,875
Don't think what's happening out there
changes who we are in here.

270
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,795
- You going to prison bothers me?
- I coulïve killed you. I didn't.

271
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,509
Yeah. We see how well
that worked out for you, don't we?

272
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,552
Stupid fuckin' idiot.
Plans don't change.

273
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,431
Hey, man.

274
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,590
You ain't no hero, kid.
We both know that.

277
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,559
Fuck!

What are you doing? Hey. Stop it.

She's alive.

281
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,268
Are you nuts?
You can't open that door, OK?

282
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,477
She's alive. Look.
I can't leave her out there.

283
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,311
No. She's...

284
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,028
Alright.

285
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,230
We'll watch the monitor, make sure
that thing on the car doesn't move.

286
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,993
You wanna tell me the rest?

287
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,791
Well, if...
if it goes to get you or whatever,

288
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,112
we're gonna shut that door, we're gonna
lock it and it's gonna stay shut.

289
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,314
You're OK.

290
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,314
- We can lock him out.
- He's got a gun.

291
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,710
- He can shoot through glass.
- Yeah, but he's out of bullets.

292
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,837
- It takes six, right?
- I don't know.

293
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,831
The girl shot two.
How many did he shoot?

294
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,399
What if he has more bullets? No.

295
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,237
Baby? Are you alright here, baby?

296
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,955
Talk to me. Can you hear me?

297
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,633
There you go. There you go.

298
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,759
- Seth, he's gonna kill us.
- Look, OK.

299
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,671
Just statistically speaking,

300
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,911
most people survive hostage situations
if you just stay calm.

301
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,116
Stay calm!

302
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,273
I'm just gonna take you inside,
alright? OK?

303
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,156
Just stay still. Stay still.

304
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,276
Talk to me. Can you hear me?

305
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:26,511
Jesus. She's dead.
He's completely insane.

306
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,549
OK, alright, I'm just gonna
drag you inside. Here we go.

307
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,228
Oh, my God.

308
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,238
- Come on.
- Polly, here he comes, OK?

309
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,835
Polly, open the door. We're gonna
get through this. Just be calm.

310
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,150
- You don't know that.
- Polly.

311
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,394
- Seth...
- Open the door.

312
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,517
- Open the door!
- Let him in. Polly, let him in.

313
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,989
- She's alive! Open the door!
- It's OK.

314
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,550
Open the door. He's right there!
Open the fucking door.

315
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,234
One!

316
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,312
- Two.
- It's OK. It's OK. No, no, no.

317
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,755
<i>Three. (screams)</i>

318
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,877
Don't! It's attacking him!
Don't open it!

319
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,751
<i>(Polly) No! What is?
Seth, what is? What is that?</i>

320
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,116
Get away from it.

321
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,351
Seth, come on, man.

322
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,473
It's moving.
It's actually moving itself.

323
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,591
It's going for the blood.

324
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,629
- Don't. Come on. Don't.
- Wait.

325
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,073
You see this? It's following me.

326
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,155
It's actually following me.

327
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,992
Look at this.

328
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,592
Do you see that? It's... It's...

329
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,154
It's f...

330
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,995
It's metabolising.

331
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,513
<i>(Dennis) What?</i>

332
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,434
I can't believe this. I think
it's feeding. It's digesting the blood.

333
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,354
See the black stuff right there?
I think that's the waste.

334
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,355
- It was eating her?
- No.

335
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,036
It's absorbing...
the nutrients on a cellular...

336
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,554
It's more like a mould, I think.

337
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,835
What are you saying?
It feeds on people?

338
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,639
No. It probably feeds on any animal.

339
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,518
This is new. I've never seen
anything like this before.

340
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,353
<i>(Polly) What is it?</i>

341
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,237
<i>(Seth) I think... I think it's stopping.</i>

<i>- (thudding)
- (Polly) What was that?</i>

343
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,751
What was that?

344
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,628
What the fuck?

345
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,237
Er, it's OK.

346
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,110
- Hey. Hey, man.
- Don't.

347
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,996
- Oh, Jesus.
- Don't. Come on. Don't.

348
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,277
I have to, OK? I have to. Just trust me.
Hey. Hey, man.

349
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,959
Look, you can't help her, OK?
It's not her any more.

350
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,156
Look, come on, man. Please.

351
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,355
You should come with us, OK?
Come with us.

352
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,156
You gotta come with me now, OK?
It's not her any more, alright?

353
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,037
Go, baby. It's OK.

It's not her, OK? It's OK. Go. Go.

356
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,551
Help me get this open.

357
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,479
OK. Alright.

358
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,233
Shit! We need keys.

359
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,710
<i>- (thudding)

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,591
Shh. OK.

371
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,034
- Gotta pop the hinges.
- What?

372
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,759
- Screwdriver.
- What?

373
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,596
Seth! Seth, get me a screwdriver.

374
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,790

The plan was to get her to Mexico,
get her clean.

380
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,188
We both wanted a baby.

381
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,634
We got a name in our minds.

382
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,678
It was definitely gonna be a baby girl.

383
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,596
We gotta get out of this gas station.

384
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,748
- I can't get it.
- Let me get it.

385
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,596
Hurry, baby. Hurry.

386
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,557
Are you ready? On three.
One, two, three. Stand back.

Drop the gun.
Put your hands on your head.

Look, you're not listening.
There's something out there!

Got every state trooper
looking for you, Farell.

None of them would mind
taking you out of here feet first.

406

Ma'am, you really have to
get in your car, OK?

407
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,359

Listen to me. You're gonna get

Wake the whole goddamn state

Tell them you've got

It killed her. It killed the other girl.

A gun and a bat ain't gonna do shit.

You got a firecracker

OK. Let's, er... Let's just start
with what we know, OK?

We don't know shit, Seth.
We know it attacks you and you die.

449
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,033
No, we know that that thing infected his
girlfriend, so it's a parasite, right?

450
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,396
It... It uses its host for mobility.
It consumes you.

451
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,508
- It's... It's like a fungus or a mould.
- OK, so what are you saying?

452
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,074
I don't know.

453
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,152
So what you're saying is,
it attacks you and you die.

454
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:11,355
She called it in, right?
So someone's gonna come.

455

She called it in.

- Nobody's coming.
- How do you know that?

457
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,392
She said they were looking for you.
There's a manhunt on.

Not here, there ain't.
Down south there will be.

00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,472
There's ten feet
between the building and the trees.

Oil runs down the steps,
across the dirt, into the trees.

470

You wanna set the forest on fire?

471
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,397
- Light it up and wait for the sirens.
- It won't work. Motor oil won't burn.

472
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,676

Wait. This is insane. You realise
the fire's gonna come right back at us?

475
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,159
- It won't.

What if it's outside the door right now?

479
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,831
Can we just stop
and think this through for a second?

480
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,911
This'll work.

481

This is a gas station. We're sitting on
a giant tank of gasoline.

484
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,435

618
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,033
He died about a year later, and by then,
him and his old lady had gone bankrupt

619
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:36,318
from all the medical bills
and I was sitting in the penitentiary.

620
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,399
I know how it sounds.

621
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,758
I just figured if I ever got out,
I'd do two things.

622
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,150
I'd get my ass
across the border with Lacey

623
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,232
and make sure his wife
was taken care of.

624
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,158
You were gonna give your nest egg
to that trucker's wife?

625
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,555
I know it sounds foolish, but...

626
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,950
...I figured if I ever got
a second chance, she should too.

627
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,989
Isn't he the strangest one-armed convict
you've ever met?

628
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,039
- Baby?
- Temperature.

629
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,798
- I have to check something.
- What?

630
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,518
<i>(Seth) We gotta chance it.</i>

631
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,511
Seth.

632
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,834
- I don't see it.
- Stay ready.

633
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,109
Maybe it rejoined the big one.

634
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,159
<i>(Polly) Do you see it?</i>

635
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,952
Seth.

636
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,477
Do you see it?

637
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,153
Now, watch this.
Now, this has been stuck in my head.

638
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,231
<i>(Dennis on tape) Watch out!</i>

639
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:19,472
Why does it give up on me
and go straight for the car?

640
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,077
<i>- (Dennis on tape) Watch out!
- See, it just hits the car.</i>

641
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,516
It doesn't turn after me.
I don't think it was ever going for me.

642
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,991
It was going for the car cos the car
was hotter. I think it tracks with heat.

643
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,998
It's a simple organism
and it's just looking for food.

644
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,196
It goes for the warmest thing
and kills it.

645
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,477
The engine was overheated, right?
So it was way hotter than me.

646
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,755
It can't track us in the refrigerator.

647
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,230
Exactly. It's too cold.
We're invisible to it.

648
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,230
All I have to do is walk to the
sheriff's car and bring it to the door.

649
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:02,871
No. That thing would be on you
in three seconds. You said so yourself.

650
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,509
Yeah, but not if my temperature
was below the ambient temperature.

651
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,955
The human body can drop
to 32 degrees Celsius

652
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:13,830
before medical emergency occurs,
so that's 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

653
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,876
Thank God for global warming in July.

654
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,111
All we have to do is keep
my body temperature below 93 degrees.

655
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,794
I'll be like a fucking ghost
to that thing.

656
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,712
What about the medical emergency?

657
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,551
<i>(Polly) 95.</i>

658
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,755
Seth, you're gonna kill yourself.

659
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,991
Not if you keep me above 89.6.

660
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,594

I know.

664
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,669
But if we don't get out of here,
I'm never gonna...

665

You don't wanna do too much of that.
You're gonna warm up my lips.

669

Shut up.

670

Almost ready.

- Got enough?
- Yeah.

675

Hey, make sure she's ready
when I bring the car around, OK?

676
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,595
She usually takes forever with that.

677
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,877
No, no, no, don't touch me.
You're gonna warm me up.

Come back.
