- Shoot them!

181

No. No!

182
00:22:07,612 --> 00:22:09,279
Those walkers on the road
would hear it.

183
00:22:09,314 --> 00:22:11,481
Then it wouldn't be just two,
it'd be hundreds.

184
00:22:11,516 --> 00:22:12,982
Come here.
Come on.

You stay there.
Wait.

188
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:26,796
( Splashes ) Come on.

189
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:34,403
Sophia, you have
to do exactly as I say.

190
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,272
Hide in there.
Squeeze in tight.

191
00:22:36,306 --> 00:22:38,307
- I'll draw them away from you.
- No no, don't leave me.

192
00:22:38,342 --> 00:22:40,276
Listen listen listen listen.

193
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,445
They don't get winded.
I do.

194
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:44,247
I can only deal
with them one at a time.

195
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:45,882
I wouldn't be able
to protect you.

196
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,784
This is how we both survive.
You understand?

197
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:51,186
Okay?
Go go go go.

198
00:22:53,757 --> 00:22:56,625
If I don't make it back,
run back to the highway,

199
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,861
back to the others
straight the way we came.

200

Sure this is the spot?

212
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:39,646
I left her right here.

213
00:24:39,681 --> 00:24:42,615
I drew the walkers way off
in that direction up the creek.

214
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,352
Without a paddle--
seems where we've landed.

215
00:24:46,387 --> 00:24:48,722
She was gone by the time
I got back here.

216
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:51,624
I figured she just took off
and ran back to the group.

217
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,694
I told her go that way

218
00:24:53,728 --> 00:24:55,628
and keep the sun
on her left shoulder.

219
00:24:57,765 --> 00:25:00,000
Hey, short round, why don't
you step off to one side?

220
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:01,501
<i>You're mucking up the trail.</i>

221
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:03,036
Assuming she knows
her left from her right.

222
00:25:03,071 --> 00:25:04,970
Shane, she understood me fine.

223
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,039
Shane:
<i>Kid's tired and scared, man.</i>

224
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:08,874
She had her a close call
with two walkers.

225
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:10,843
Got to wonder how much
of what you said stuck.

226
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:13,179
Got clear prints right here.

227
00:25:13,214 --> 00:25:15,515
She did like you said,
headed back to the highway.

228
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:18,418
- Let's spread out, make our way back.
- <i>She couldn't have gone far.</i>

229
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:22,088
Hey, we gonna find her.

230
00:25:22,122 --> 00:25:23,989
She'll be tuckered out
hiding in a bush somewhere.

231
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:35,734
She was doing just fine
till right here.

232
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:38,503
All she had to do
was keep going.

233
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,872
She veered off that way.

234
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,674
Glenn:
Why would she do that?

235
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,977
Maybe she saw something that
spooked her, made her run off.

236
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,713
A walker?

237
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,948
I don't see
any other footprints.

238
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:51,483
Just hers.

239
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:54,453
So what do we do?
All of us press on?

240
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:57,155
No, better if you and Glenn
get back up to the highway.

241
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,090
People are gonna
start panicking.

242
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:02,193
<i>Let them know we're on her</i>
<i>trail doing everything we can.</i>

243
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,195
But most of all,
keep everybody calm.

244
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,030
I'll keep 'em
busy scavenging cars.

245
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,800
Think up a few other chores.
I'll keep 'em occupied.

246
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,969
Come on.

247
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:19,244

00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,312
( Revs )

249
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:44,367
Why aren't we all out there looking?
Why are we moving cars?

250
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,636
We have to clear enough
room so I can get the R.V.

251
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,238
turned around as soon
as it's running.

252
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,674
Now that we have fuel
we can double back

253
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:53,476
to a bypass that Glenn
flagged on the map.

254
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,146
Going back's going to be easier than
trying to get through this mess.

255
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,315
We're not going anywhere
till my daughter gets back.

256
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:00,217
Hey, that goes without saying.

257
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,052
Rick and Daryl,
they're on it, okay?

258
00:27:03,086 --> 00:27:06,289
- Just a matter of time.
- Can't be soon enough for me.

259
00:27:06,323 --> 00:27:09,125
I'm still freaked out from
that herd that passed us by,

260
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,760
- or whatever you'd call it.
- Yeah, what was that?

261
00:27:11,795 --> 00:27:13,362
All of them just
marching along like that.

262
00:27:13,396 --> 00:27:17,033
A herd.
That sounds about right.

263
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:19,936
<i>We've seen it.</i>
<i>It's like the night camp got attacked.</i>

264
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,404
<i>Some wandering pack,</i>
<i>only fewer.</i>

265
00:27:22,439 --> 00:27:24,106
( Exhales ) Okay.

266
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:26,843
Come on, people.
We still got a lot to do.

267
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:28,945
Let's stay on it.
Let's go, come on.

268
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:43,992
Tracks are gone.

269
00:27:44,026 --> 00:27:46,294
No, they're faint,

270
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:48,430
but they ain't gone.

271
00:27:48,465 --> 00:27:50,298
She came through here.

272
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,100
How can you tell?

273
00:27:52,134 --> 00:27:54,470
I don't see anything.
Dirt, grass.

274
00:27:54,504 --> 00:27:56,972
You want a lesson in tracking
or you want to find that girl

275
00:27:57,006 --> 00:27:59,040
and get our ass off
that interstate?

276

( Shrieks )

278
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:22,989
- Shane.
- Carl, what happened?

279
00:29:23,023 --> 00:29:25,224
I found something cool.

280
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:27,093
Shane, check it out.

281
00:29:28,562 --> 00:29:30,396
It's an arsenal.

282
00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:32,298
That's cool, bud.
Go give 'em to Dale.

283
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,300
Check this one out.

284
00:29:34,335 --> 00:29:36,669
Whoa, it's a hatchet.

285
00:29:36,703 --> 00:29:39,072
- Be careful. Don't play with those.
- They're really sharp.

286
00:29:39,106 --> 00:29:42,041
- What did I just say?
- Can I keep one?

287
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:44,643
- Are you crazy?
- No way.

288
00:29:44,678 --> 00:29:47,680
Shane. Shane, tell her
to let me keep one.

289
00:29:49,315 --> 00:29:52,184
Hey, man, go give them
all to Dale now. Go.

290
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:05,263
- What was that?
- What was what?

291
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:07,933
The way you blew him off just now.
You crushed him.

292
00:30:14,641 --> 00:30:17,275
I don't believe you.
You're giving me the cold shoulder?

293
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,044
Isn't that what you want?

294
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:21,946
Aren't you the one who said stay
the hell away from him and you?

295
00:30:21,981 --> 00:30:24,482
You forget what happened
at the CDC?

296
00:30:24,517 --> 00:30:27,485
Your little meltdown in the
rec room slip your mind?

297
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,487
- When you tried--
- When I tried to what?

298
00:30:29,522 --> 00:30:31,255
What do you think that was?

299
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:34,759
I think it is pretty plain
what that was.

300
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:37,996
A mistake.
One that I admit to.

301
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,965
I have a few mistakes
under my belt, Lori.

302
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,267
So do you.

303
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:45,803
No debate there.

304
00:30:45,838 --> 00:30:48,606
But Shane, we need
to stop this.

305
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:50,775
Why do you think
I'm prepping my new ride?

306
00:30:52,377 --> 00:30:54,412
I'm leaving.

307
00:30:54,446 --> 00:30:56,480
Leaving?

308
00:30:56,515 --> 00:30:58,549
As in gone for good.

309
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:02,486
Gonna quietly slip away
first chance I get.

00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,906
Sophia!

326
00:32:46,614 --> 00:32:48,081
What are you looking for?

327
00:32:48,115 --> 00:32:50,684
Skin under the fingernails.

328
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:58,725
It fed recently.

329
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:07,667
There's flesh
caught in its teeth.

330
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,204
Yeah, what kind of flesh?

331
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,908
Only one way to know for sure.

332
00:33:20,747 --> 00:33:22,882
Here, I'll do it.

333
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,750
How many kills you skin
and gut in your life?

334
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:27,686
Anyway, mine is sharper.

335
00:33:30,524 --> 00:33:32,558
( Grunts )

336
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,837
( Grunts )

337
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:05,891
Now comes the bad part.

338
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:10,429
( Groans )

339
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:22,707
( Groans )

340
00:34:24,377 --> 00:34:26,979
( Panting )

341
00:34:35,588 --> 00:34:38,723
Yeah, Hoss had a big meal
not long ago.

342
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:40,892
I feel it in there.

343
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,465
( Groans )

344
00:34:49,535 --> 00:34:51,769
- Here's the gut bag.
- I got this.

345
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:59,443
( Panting )

346
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,715
( Groans )

347
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:16,694
This gross bastard had himself
a woodchuck for lunch.

348
00:35:20,132 --> 00:35:22,133
At least we know.

349
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:24,168
At least we know.

350
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:40,351
It's late.
Gonna be dark soon.

351
00:35:41,953 --> 00:35:43,921
They'll find her.

352
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,897
Where's my gun?

353
00:35:53,932 --> 00:35:55,666
You have no right to take it.

354
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,501
You don't need that
just now, do you?

355
00:35:57,536 --> 00:35:59,170
My father gave it to me.
It's mine.

356
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:01,972
I can hold onto it for you.

357
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:03,974
Or you can give it back to me.

358
00:36:04,008 --> 00:36:05,909
Everything cool?

359
00:36:05,944 --> 00:36:07,377
No, I want my gun back.

360
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:10,213
I don't think
it's a good idea right now.

361
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:12,282
Why not?

362
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:16,219
I'm not comfortable with it.

363
00:36:16,253 --> 00:36:18,055
( Scoffs )

364
00:36:21,525 --> 00:36:23,694
The truth is,

365
00:36:23,728 --> 00:36:27,064
less guns we have floating
around camp the better.

366
00:36:27,098 --> 00:36:28,498
You turning over your weapon?

367
00:36:28,532 --> 00:36:30,934
( Chuckles ) No.

368
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:33,936
But I'm trained in its use.

369
00:36:33,971 --> 00:36:36,538
That's what the rest of y'all
need is proper training.

370
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:39,909
But until that time I think it's best
if Dale keeps them all accounted for.

371
00:36:39,943 --> 00:36:42,044
( Scoffs )
Uh-huh.

372
00:36:45,983 --> 00:36:47,683
Mind telling me
what that's about?

373
00:36:47,718 --> 00:36:49,284
Oh God, they're back.

374
00:36:52,956 --> 00:36:54,590
You didn't find her?

375
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:56,325
Her trail went cold.

376
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:58,227
We'll pick it up again
at first light.

377
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:00,863
You can't leave my daughter
out there on her own

378
00:37:00,897 --> 00:37:02,632
<i>to spend the night</i>
<i>alone in the woods.</i>

379
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:04,533
Out in the dark's no good.

380
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:07,269
We'd just be tripping over ourselves.
More people get lost.

381
00:37:07,303 --> 00:37:09,904
But she's 12.
She can't be out there on her own.

382
00:37:09,939 --> 00:37:11,973
- You didn't find anything?
- I know this is hard.

383
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:13,442
But I'm asking you
not to panic.

384
00:37:13,476 --> 00:37:14,809
We know she was out there.

385
00:37:14,844 --> 00:37:16,512
And we tracked her for a while.

386
00:37:16,546 --> 00:37:19,014
We have to make this
an organized effort.

387
00:37:19,048 --> 00:37:20,882
<i>Daryl knows the woods</i>
<i>better than anybody.</i>

388
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:23,485
I've asked him to oversee this.

389
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,920
Is that blood?

390
00:37:25,955 --> 00:37:27,922
( Breathing heavily )

391
00:37:27,957 --> 00:37:31,226
- We took down a walker.
- Walker? Oh my God.

392
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:34,095
There was no sign it was
ever anywhere near Sophia.

393
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,465
Andrea:
How can you know that?

394
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:43,138
We cut the son of a
bitch open, made sure.

395
00:37:46,508 --> 00:37:49,010
Oh God.

396
00:37:53,783 --> 00:37:57,451
How could you just leave her
out there to begin with?

397
00:37:58,954 --> 00:38:00,889
How could you just leave her?

398
00:38:00,923 --> 00:38:02,924
Those two walkers were on us.

399
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:06,027
I had to draw them off.

400
00:38:06,062 --> 00:38:07,495
It was her best chance.

401
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:08,997
Sounds like he didn't
have a choice, Carol.

402
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:11,733
How was she supposed to
find her way back on her own?

403
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:14,902
She's just a child.
She's just a child.

404
00:38:14,936 --> 00:38:18,506
It was my only option.
The only choice I could make.

405
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,543
I'm sure nobody doubts that.

406
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,951
My little girl got left
in the woods.

407
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:05,024
Everybody takes a weapon.

408
00:39:05,058 --> 00:39:06,993
These aren't the kind
of weapons we need.

409
00:39:07,027 --> 00:39:09,763
- What about the guns?
- We've been over that.

410
00:39:09,797 --> 00:39:12,064
Daryl, Rick and I are carrying.

411
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:15,034
We can't have people popping off
rounds every time a tree rustles.

412
00:39:15,068 --> 00:39:16,736
It's not the trees
I'm worried about.

413
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,938
Say somebody fires
at the wrong moment,

414
00:39:18,972 --> 00:39:20,472
a herd happens
to be passing by.

415
00:39:20,507 --> 00:39:22,408
See, then it's game over
for all of us.

416
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:24,043
So you need to get over it.

417
00:39:25,578 --> 00:39:27,947
Daryl: <i>The idea is to take the creek</i>
<i>up about five miles,</i>

418
00:39:27,981 --> 00:39:29,882
<i>turn around and come</i>
<i>back down the other side.</i>

419
00:39:29,917 --> 00:39:31,884
Chances are
she'll be by the creek.

420
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:33,485
It's her only landmark.

421
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,188
Stay quiet and stay sharp.

422
00:39:35,222 --> 00:39:38,257
Keep space between you but always
stay within sight of each other.

423
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,459
Shane:
Everybody assemble your packs.

424
00:39:40,493 --> 00:39:42,628
Keep on those repairs.

425
00:39:42,662 --> 00:39:44,630
We've got to get
this R.V. ready to move.

426
00:39:44,664 --> 00:39:47,499
We won't stay here a minute
longer than we have to.

427
00:39:47,534 --> 00:39:49,968
Good luck out there.

428
00:39:50,002 --> 00:39:52,170
Bring Sophia back.

429
00:39:52,205 --> 00:39:53,905
Keep an eye on Carl
while we're gone.

430
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,741
I'm going with you.

431
00:39:56,775 --> 00:39:59,377
You need people, right?
To cover as much ground as possible.

432
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:01,146
( Groans )

433
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:05,516
Your call.
I can't always be the bad guy.

434
00:40:07,486 --> 00:40:09,587
Well, he has all of you
to look after him.

435
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:11,689
I'd say he's in good hands.

436
00:40:12,725 --> 00:40:15,327
Okay.
Okay.

437
00:40:15,361 --> 00:40:17,628
But always within our sight,
no exceptions.

438
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,242
Andrea, I'm begging you.
Don't put me in this position.

439
00:40:31,276 --> 00:40:33,378
I'm not going out
there without my gun.

440
00:40:33,412 --> 00:40:34,912
I'll even say please.

441
00:40:36,882 --> 00:40:38,383
I'm doing this for you.

442
00:40:38,417 --> 00:40:40,518
No, Dale, you're doing
it for you.

443
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:43,354
You need to stop.
What do you think's gonna happen?

444
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:46,457
I'm gonna stick it in my mouth and pull
the trigger the moment you hand it to me?

445
00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:48,760
Dale:
<i>I know you're angry at me.</i>

446
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:50,795
<i>That much is clear.</i>

447
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:53,230
But if I hadn't
done what I did,

448
00:40:53,265 --> 00:40:55,399
you'd be dead now.

449
00:40:55,433 --> 00:40:57,967
Jenner gave us an option.
I chose to stay.

450
00:40:58,002 --> 00:41:01,004
- You chose suicide.
- So what's that to you? You barely know me.

451
00:41:01,038 --> 00:41:03,940
- I know Amy's death devastated you.
- Keep her out of this.

452
00:41:03,974 --> 00:41:06,676
This is not about Amy.
This is about us.

453
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:10,280
<i>And if I decided that I had</i>
<i>nothing left to live for,</i>

454
00:41:10,314 --> 00:41:12,282
who the hell are you
to tell me otherwise?

455
00:41:12,316 --> 00:41:15,084
To force my hand like that?

456
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,121
- I saved your life.
- No, Dale.

457
00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:20,457
I saved yours.
You forced that on me.

458
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:22,492
I didn't want
your blood on my hands

459
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:24,428
and that is the only reason
I left that building.

460
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:27,363
What did you expect?
What, I'd have some kind of epiphany?

461
00:41:27,398 --> 00:41:29,765
Some life-affirming
catharsis?

462
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,601
Maybe just a little gratitude.

463
00:41:32,636 --> 00:41:34,236
Gratitude?

464
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,705
I wanted to die my way,

465
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,974
not torn apart
by drooling freaks.

466
00:41:39,008 --> 00:41:41,376
That was my choice.

467
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:44,112
You took that
away from me, Dale.

468
00:41:44,147 --> 00:41:46,281
- But--
- But you know better?

469
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:51,587
All I wanted after my sister
died was to get out

470
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:54,323
of this endless horrific
nightmare we live every day.

471
00:41:54,357 --> 00:41:57,092
I wasn't hurting anyone else.

472
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:59,428
You took my choice away, Dale.

473
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:03,465
And you expect gratitude?

474
00:42:10,273 --> 00:42:12,341
I don't know what to say.

475
00:42:13,943 --> 00:42:16,044
I'm not your little girl.

476
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,414
I'm not your wife.
And I am sure as hell not your problem.

477
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:22,184
That's all there is to say.

478
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:00,388
Shane, look.

479
00:43:00,422 --> 00:43:02,990
Dad said I could carry it and
mom said as long as I was--

480
00:43:03,024 --> 00:43:06,059
Keep it down.
We're looking for Sophia.

481
00:43:06,093 --> 00:43:07,561
You need to focus on the task.

482
00:43:11,198 --> 00:43:13,834
- Got to keep up.
- I am.

483
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,805
- You okay?
- I think Shane's mad at me.

484
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,374
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

485
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:23,710
No, honey, I promise you.

486
00:43:23,745 --> 00:43:27,347
He's just--he's worried about
Sophia, that's all.

487
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:29,281
Come on.

488
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,269
Shane:
She could be in there.

489
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:52,504
Could be a whole bunch
of things in there.

490
00:44:31,477 --> 00:44:32,876
Carol.

491
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,050
<i>Call out softly.</i>

492
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:43,020
If she's in there, yours is the
first voice she should hear.

493
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,891
Sophia, sweetie,

494
00:44:47,926 --> 00:44:49,927
<i>are you in there?</i>

495
00:44:49,961 --> 00:44:52,396
<i>Sophia, it's mommy.</i>

496
00:44:52,431 --> 00:44:55,133
Sophia.
We're all here, baby.

497
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,168
It's mommy.

498
00:45:05,076 --> 00:45:07,377
( Unzipping slowly )

499
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,718
( Coughs )

500
00:45:24,629 --> 00:45:26,864
( Coughs, gags )

501
00:45:33,171 --> 00:45:35,539
Daryl?

502
00:45:37,808 --> 00:45:39,876
<i>Daryl?</i>

503
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:47,417
It ain't her.

504
00:45:49,987 --> 00:45:51,888
- What's in there?
- <i>Some guy.</i>

505
00:45:51,922 --> 00:45:54,791
Did what Jenner said.
Opted out.

506
00:45:54,825 --> 00:45:57,427
Ain't that what he called it?

507
00:45:59,063 --> 00:46:01,298
<i>( Church bells ringing )</i>

508
00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:12,775
What direction?

509
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:15,912
I think that way.
I'm pretty sure.

510
00:46:15,946 --> 00:46:17,646
Damn, it's hard
to tell out here.

511
00:46:17,681 --> 00:46:19,348
If we heard them,
maybe Sophia did too.

512
00:46:19,382 --> 00:46:21,184
Someone's ringing those bells,
maybe calling others.

513
00:46:21,218 --> 00:46:22,752
Or signaling they found her.

514
00:46:22,786 --> 00:46:25,354
She could be ringing
them herself.

515
00:46:31,225 --> 00:46:33,926
T-Dog: <i>Ain't you supposed to be</i>
<i>fixing that radiator?</i>

516
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:35,428
What if they come
back with Sophia

517
00:46:35,463 --> 00:46:37,330
and Rick wants to
move on right away?

518
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,035
- I had it fixed yesterday.
- What?

519
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:44,537
What was all that rubbing
and sanding for then?

520
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:47,374
- That just bullshit?
- Yeah, that's one word.

521
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:50,109
Another word
would be pantomime--

522
00:46:50,143 --> 00:46:52,378
just for show.

523
00:46:52,412 --> 00:46:55,214
No one else needs to know that.

524
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,851
Pantomime.

525
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:01,120
If the others know
we're mobile,

526
00:47:01,154 --> 00:47:03,523
they'll want to mobilize
and move on.

527
00:47:03,557 --> 00:47:05,958
So you don't think they're
gonna find Sophia, that it?

528
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:08,227
I'm just guarding
against the worst.

529
00:47:08,261 --> 00:47:10,563
Sooner or later,
if she's not found,

530
00:47:10,597 --> 00:47:13,165
people will start doing math.

531
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,703
I want to hold off
the needs-of-the-many-

532
00:47:17,738 --> 00:47:21,273
versus-the-needs-of-the-few
arguments as long as I can.

533
00:47:23,243 --> 00:47:26,477
That is one tricky hose, huh?

534
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:28,580
Very.

535
00:47:38,758 --> 00:47:41,893
That can't be it.
Got no steeple, no bells.

536
00:47:41,928 --> 00:47:44,796
Rick.

537
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:12,690
( Snarling )

538
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,191
( Kissing sounds )

539
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,464
( Grunting )

540
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:00,337
( Panting )

541
00:49:05,975 --> 00:49:08,677
Sophia!

542
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,715
Yo, J.C.,
you taking requests?

543
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,952
I'm telling you, it's the wrong church.
It's got no steeple, Rick.

544
00:49:16,986 --> 00:49:19,288
There's no steeple.

545
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:22,324
<i>( Bells ringing )</i>

546
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,269
<i>( Ringing stops )</i>

547
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,671
A timer.
It's on a timer.

548
00:49:39,908 --> 00:49:42,310
I'm gonna go back in for a bit.

549
00:50:07,903 --> 00:50:09,704
Lori:
<i>Are you really leaving?</i>

550
00:50:09,738 --> 00:50:11,538
Shane: <i>Don't you think</i>
<i>it's best for all of us?</i>

551
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:14,842
I think it is.
What made you decide?

552
00:50:14,876 --> 00:50:18,212
Gotta back away.
Just trying to be the good guy here, Lori,

553
00:50:18,246 --> 00:50:21,148
even if you don't see it.
None of this was intended.

554
00:50:21,183 --> 00:50:24,185
I hope you know that.

555
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:28,055
Well, don't matter.
As long as I said it.

556
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:31,158
You're just gonna disappear?
You're not even gonna tell Rick?

557
00:50:31,193 --> 00:50:33,127
He'd only try to stop me.
No, that's on you.

558
00:50:33,161 --> 00:50:35,462
You tell him what you want.
Or tell him nothing at all.

559
00:50:35,496 --> 00:50:38,833
- You're his wife.
- And Carl? We dragged him into this.

560
00:50:38,867 --> 00:50:40,601
- I love Carl.
- He thinks you hate him.

561
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:42,770
I'm trying to put some distance.
I'm trying to make this easier.

562
00:50:42,804 --> 00:50:44,971
This ain't easy on any
of us, least of all me.

563
00:50:45,005 --> 00:50:46,873
I'm the one who loses you.

564
00:51:18,376 --> 00:51:20,077
Father, forgive me.

565
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:24,181
I don't deserve your mercy.

566
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:29,786
I prayed for safe passage
from Atlanta and you provided.

567
00:51:29,821 --> 00:51:32,990
I prayed for Ed to be punished

568
00:51:33,024 --> 00:51:34,691
for laying his hands on me

569
00:51:34,726 --> 00:51:38,028
and for looking
at his own daughter

570
00:51:38,062 --> 00:51:41,632
with whatever sickness
was growing in his soul.

571
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:44,701
I prayed you'd put
a stop to it,

572
00:51:46,638 --> 00:51:48,705
<i>give me a chance</i>
<i>to raise her right,</i>

573
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,306
<i>help her not make my mistakes.</i>

574
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:53,143
She's so fearful.

575
00:51:55,046 --> 00:51:57,547
She's so young in her way.

576
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:00,416
She hasn't had a chance.

577
00:52:06,858 --> 00:52:09,626
Praying for Ed's death
was a sin.

578
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:16,533
Please, don't let this
be my punishment.

579
00:52:17,568 --> 00:52:21,004
<i>Let her be safe,</i>

580
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:23,406
alive and safe.

581
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,509
Please, lord.

582
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:30,612
Punish me however you want,

583
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,750
but show mercy on her.

584
00:52:51,534 --> 00:52:53,335
I'm coming with you.

585
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:54,937
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

586
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:57,073
I'm not stupid
and I'm certainly not deaf.

587
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,775
- Look, I don't know the story.
- There is no story.

588
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:02,177
Fine, I don't care.
Don't confuse me with someone who does.

589
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:04,079
Look, all I care about
is getting out of here

590
00:53:04,113 --> 00:53:06,848
as far away as I can, like you.

591
00:53:06,882 --> 00:53:10,218
We're gonna sail off into the sunset together?
We gonna hold hands?

592
00:53:10,252 --> 00:53:13,088
I'm not asking you to go steady, Shane.
I'm asking for a ride,

593
00:53:13,122 --> 00:53:16,257
a chance to start over
somewhere else.

594
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:18,793
<i>You observe this group lately?</i>

595
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:22,063
I have. I see two people
who don't belong.

596
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:23,998
We're the odd men out.

597
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:26,534
Between the two of us,
we make a great third wheel.

598
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:29,938
So what? Say we do,
we just run off.

599
00:53:29,972 --> 00:53:32,573
What's in it for me except for
the extra ass I got to cover?

600
00:53:32,608 --> 00:53:35,209
The chance to do something
for someone else.

601
00:53:35,243 --> 00:53:38,912
- Yeah.
- <i>And a door that swings both ways.</i>

602
00:53:38,947 --> 00:53:41,048
Put a gun in my hand,
I'll cover your ass too.

603
00:53:41,082 --> 00:53:42,950
( Scoffs )

604
00:53:44,485 --> 00:53:46,220
Think it over.

605
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:50,257
( Sighs )

606
00:53:53,327 --> 00:53:55,595
Got to move here, man.

607
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,598
These people are spent.

608
00:53:58,633 --> 00:54:01,034
There's only so many
hours of daylight left.

609
00:54:01,069 --> 00:54:03,703
- We still got a long way back.
- I can't stop yet.

610
00:54:03,738 --> 00:54:05,405
We still got
a lot of ground to cover,

611
00:54:05,439 --> 00:54:06,939
whole other side
of the Creek Bed.

612
00:54:06,974 --> 00:54:08,541
So we search that
on the way back.

613
00:54:08,576 --> 00:54:10,910
She would have heard those church bells.
She could be nearby.

614
00:54:10,944 --> 00:54:14,213
- She could be a lot of things.
- I can't go back.

615
00:54:14,248 --> 00:54:16,316
Her being out here is my fault.

616
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:17,984
That's great.

617
00:54:18,018 --> 00:54:20,153
Now they got you
doubting yourself, huh?

618
00:54:20,187 --> 00:54:22,455
What about you?
You doubt me?

619
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:25,392
Hey, we can assign
all kinds of blame.

620
00:54:25,426 --> 00:54:27,494
This means something,
finding her.

621
00:54:27,528 --> 00:54:29,462
Oh man.

622
00:54:29,497 --> 00:54:33,132
It would be the miracle we need.
We can't give up.

623
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:35,368
( Sighs )

624
00:54:35,403 --> 00:54:36,902
Mmm.

625
00:54:38,638 --> 00:54:41,273
Ahem.

626
00:54:41,308 --> 00:54:44,476
Y'all gonna follow the Creek Bed back, okay?
Daryl, you're in charge.

627
00:54:44,511 --> 00:54:46,612
<i>Me and Rick, we're just</i>
<i>gonna hang back,</i>

628
00:54:46,646 --> 00:54:48,980
search this area another hour
or so just to be thorough.

629
00:54:49,015 --> 00:54:51,750
You're splitting us up.
You sure?

630
00:54:51,785 --> 00:54:54,019
Yeah, we'll catch up to you.

631
00:54:54,053 --> 00:54:56,021
Carl:
<i>I want to stay too.</i>

632
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:59,191
I'm her friend.

633
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:08,566
- Just be careful, okay?
- I will.

634
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,736
When did you start growing up?

635
00:55:18,077 --> 00:55:19,510
Rick:
<i>I'll be along soon enough.</i>

636
00:55:23,549 --> 00:55:25,683
Here, take this.

637
00:55:25,718 --> 00:55:27,485
Remember how to use it?

638
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:29,620
I'm not taking your gun
and leaving you unarmed.

639
00:55:29,655 --> 00:55:32,824
Here, got a spare.
Take it.

640
00:55:47,438 --> 00:55:49,940
- Give me a minute?
- Yeah.

641
00:55:51,843 --> 00:55:53,510
Come on.

642
00:56:05,985 --> 00:56:08,620
I don't know if you're
looking at me with what?

643
00:56:08,655 --> 00:56:11,289
( Sighs )

644
00:56:11,323 --> 00:56:13,692
Sadness?

645
00:56:13,726 --> 00:56:16,127
Scorn?

646
00:56:16,162 --> 00:56:19,264
Pity?

647
00:56:19,298 --> 00:56:22,467
<i>Love?</i>

648
00:56:22,501 --> 00:56:24,036
( Sighs )

649
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,538
Maybe it's just indifference.

650
00:56:33,345 --> 00:56:36,582
I guess you already know
I'm not much of a believer.

651
00:56:36,616 --> 00:56:39,584
I guess I just chose to
put my faith elsewhere.

652
00:56:41,587 --> 00:56:43,922
My family, mostly.

653
00:56:43,956 --> 00:56:46,558
My friends.

654
00:56:46,592 --> 00:56:49,428
My job.

655
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:55,767
The thing is, we--

656
00:57:00,806 --> 00:57:02,674
I could use a little something

657
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:05,143
to help keep us going.

658
00:57:06,612 --> 00:57:08,580
Some kind of...

659
00:57:08,614 --> 00:57:10,715
acknowledgment.

660
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:13,785
Some indication I'm doing
the right thing.

661
00:57:15,555 --> 00:57:18,256
You don't know
how hard that is to know.

662
00:57:26,532 --> 00:57:28,767
Well, maybe you do.

663
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:40,278
Hey look, I don't need
all the answers.

664
00:57:40,312 --> 00:57:42,713
Just a little nudge.
A sign.

665
00:57:46,085 --> 00:57:48,586
Any sign will do.

666
00:57:57,963 --> 00:58:01,065
- Get what you needed?
- Guess I'll find out.

667
00:58:18,617 --> 00:58:20,718
Carol:
So this is it?

668
00:58:20,752 --> 00:58:22,587
This the whole plan?

669
00:58:22,621 --> 00:58:25,255
Daryl: I guess the plan
is to whittle us down

670
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:27,058
into smaller
and smaller groups.

671
00:58:27,092 --> 00:58:29,193
Carrying knives
and pointy sticks.

672
00:58:29,227 --> 00:58:30,894
I see you have a gun.

673
00:58:30,929 --> 00:58:33,430
Why, you want it?

674
00:58:33,464 --> 00:58:35,766
Here, take it.

675
00:58:37,535 --> 00:58:39,770
I'm sick of the looks
you're giving me.

676
00:58:43,741 --> 00:58:45,475
All of you.

677
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,082
Honey, I can't imagine
what you're going through.

678
00:58:52,116 --> 00:58:53,283
And I would do
anything to stop it.

679
00:58:53,317 --> 00:58:55,385
But you have got to stop
blaming Rick.

680
00:58:55,419 --> 00:58:58,221
It is in your face
every time you look at him.

681
00:58:58,255 --> 00:59:01,758
When Sophia ran he didn't
hesitate, did he?

682
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:03,359
Not for a second.

683
00:59:03,394 --> 00:59:06,496
I don't know that any of us would
have gone after her the way he did

684
00:59:06,531 --> 00:59:08,932
<i>or made the hard decisions</i>
<i>that he had to make</i>

685
00:59:08,966 --> 00:59:12,069
or that anybody could have
done it any differently.

686
00:59:16,174 --> 00:59:18,241
Anybody?

687
00:59:26,217 --> 00:59:29,018
Y'all look to him and then you
blame him when he's not perfect.

688
00:59:29,053 --> 00:59:31,555
If you think you can do this
without him, go right ahead.

689
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:33,423
Nobody is stopping you.

690
00:59:45,235 --> 00:59:47,403
We should keep moving.

691
01:00:05,623 --> 01:00:08,024
<i>( Branches snapping )</i>

692
01:01:00,878 --> 01:01:02,712
Shane.

693
01:01:40,716 --> 01:01:42,117
<i>( Soft snap )</i>

694
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:14,082
<i>( Gunshot )</i>

695
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:19,921
Oh no.
No.

696
01:02:19,956 --> 01:02:22,390
No, no, no, no!
