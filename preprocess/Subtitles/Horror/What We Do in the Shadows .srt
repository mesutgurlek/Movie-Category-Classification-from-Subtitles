00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,966
So it's 6 PM in the night time...

3
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,477
... which is when I wake up.

4
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:01,811
This is always really scary part for me.

5
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:09,349
Yes! Night time.

6
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,423
So, now I'm going to wake up
my flat mates.

7
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:17,818
I really love living
in a flatting situation.

8
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:18,839
Wake up!

9
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:21,341
Wake up everyone!

10
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:24,144
I like to hang out with other vampires.

11
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:26,196
I like the company.

12
00:02:26,907 --> 00:02:28,749
Awaken!

13
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,252
A wakey, wakey!

14
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,256
I just really like having a good time
with my friends.

15
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,828
Deacon...

16
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:37,919
Hi!

17
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:38,660
Hey!

18
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,862
Deacon...

19
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:43,555
How was your night, last night?

20
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:47,119
I transformed into a dog and had sex.

21
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:48,460
Cool!

22
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,915
We're gonna have a little flat-meeting
in the kitchen in about 15 minutes, okay?

23
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:55,097
- Okay.
- Okay.

24
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:57,359
- Should I close this?
- Yes.

25
00:02:58,481 --> 00:02:59,932
Vladislav?!

26
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,147
Sorry! Sorry!

27
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:08,922
What?

28
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,194
- Hey!
- What time is it?

29
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:14,898
Umm, we're going to have a flat-meeting
in about 10 minutes.

30
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:15,769
20.

31
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,150
Okay... is it...

32
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:32,957
So we're...

33
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:34,669
...in Petyr's room.

34
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,791
I'm just going to wake him up.

35
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,192
Petyr?

36
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:58,824
Petyr?!

37
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:03,700
Petyr, wake up.

38
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:10,527
Hey, listen. We're just having a
flat-meeting upstairs in about 10 minutes.

39
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:13,345
You don't have to come but I thought I'd

40
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,963
extend an invitation to you just in case.

41
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,074
Umm...

42
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:21,108
There's a lot of stuff on
the floor down here, Petyr, and...

43
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,931
... like this seems, I don't... AH!

44
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,933
It's a spinal column, yuck!

45
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,065
And I was thinking, maybe...

46
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:31,004
... I just should bring a broom
down here for you

47
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,962
if you wanted to sweep up
some of the skeletons.

48
00:04:34,282 --> 00:04:35,253
I don't know.

49
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:36,294
You know...

50
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:38,466
Okay.

51
00:04:40,428 --> 00:04:42,461
I got you this chicken.

52
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:47,766
Is Petyr coming?

53
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:49,628
- Should we be worried?
- Petyr's...

54
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:50,789
... 8000 years old.

55
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,242
We're not going to have
Petyr at the meeting.

56
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:54,423
Okay, so...

57
00:04:54,724 --> 00:04:59,028
Wanted to have a quick chat
about flat responsibilities because

58
00:04:59,108 --> 00:05:02,492
uh...guys I think that we're
not all pulling our weight here.

59
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:05,595
We're not just pointing
the finger at you, Deacon.

60
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,899
You're a cool guy but you're
not pulling your weight in the flat.

61
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:11,802
Well, I'm glad to hear that I'm cool.

62
00:05:12,502 --> 00:05:15,155
- No, that's not the point though...
- Yeah, no, I know...

63
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:17,267
It's not a flat meeting about
how cool you are.

64
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:19,049
- I do my flat chores.
- No, you don't!

65
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,252
- Yes, I do
- No, that's why we're having the flat-meeting.

66
00:05:21,452 --> 00:05:25,236
The point is Deacon that you
have not done the dishes for 5 years.

67
00:05:25,436 --> 00:05:26,197
Vladislav is right.

68
00:05:26,397 --> 00:05:30,892
It's unacceptable to have so many bloody
dishes all over the bench like that...

69
00:05:31,092 --> 00:05:33,304
I'm so embarrassed
when people come over here.

70
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:33,885
Why does it matter?!

71
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:35,587
You bring them over to kill them!

72
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:37,979
Vampires don't do dishes.

73
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,823
Deacon's like the rebellious young vampire.

74
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:45,898
He's always doing crazy things.
Saying crazy things.

75
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:49,331
He's just like the young,
bad boy of the group.

76
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:51,474
Okay, so...

77
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:53,926
One day I was...

78
00:05:54,837 --> 00:05:56,789
... selling my wears...

79
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,712
And I walked passed this old creepy castle.

80
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:01,694
and I look at it and think...

81
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:04,537
... 'very old and creepy.'

82
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,490
And then this creature...

83
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,901
... flies at me!

84
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,595
It dragged me back to this dark dungeon.

85
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:13,757
And bit into my neck.

86
00:06:14,278 --> 00:06:16,560
And just at the point of death...

87
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,882
... this creature...

88
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:21,125
... forced me to suck its foul blood.

89
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:22,567
And then...

90
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:25,079
... it opened it's wings, like this.

91
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,392
And hovered above me.

92
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:28,923
Screeching.

93
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:33,808
'Now you are vampire.'

94
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:36,371
And it was Petyr.

95
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,395
And we're still friends today.

96
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:44,179
Vlad, you are great.
You put out the recycling.

97
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,711
Which was really cool.

98
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:46,472
And!

99
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:50,146
The other day, I dragged man's
body down the hallway,

100
00:06:50,226 --> 00:06:52,909
and noticed that there was no dust.

101
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,143
Like, I kind of...
I kind of swept the hallway.

102
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:58,965
Vladislav, is just like...

103
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:00,737
... this older vampire who

104
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,939
grew up in the medieval times.

105
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:05,802
And you know, to be living this long

106
00:07:06,003 --> 00:07:08,475
and to have seen the things that he's seen

107
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:11,669
and still like, kind of have it together,

108
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,041
I mean, hat's off to him.

109
00:07:14,131 --> 00:07:15,953
Bloody hell!

110
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:17,425
Sorry!

111
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,527
He's a really great guy.

112
00:07:19,727 --> 00:07:21,429
A bit a of a pervert.

113
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:25,163
He has some pretty old ideas about things.

114
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:27,395
We should get some slaves!

115
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:31,079
When I first became a vampire...

116
00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:32,991
... I was quite tyrannical.

117
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:37,346
I was known for torturing a lot of people.

118
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,731
This is my torture chamber.

119
00:07:43,522 --> 00:07:46,405
I don't come in here, often anymore.

120
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:50,500
I tempted to torture when
I was in a bad place.

121
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,883
My thing was, I would poke someone

122
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,715
with implements.

123
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:58,748
I was known as 'Vladislav the poker'.

124
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,763
It's been like this the whole time...

125
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:05,546
- Okay, so...
- Viago is a little...

126
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:06,967
... pedantic.

127
00:08:06,977 --> 00:08:09,029
The washing and the rubbish, I did that.

128
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:13,204
Deacon, on dishes and
it's still hasn't moved in 5 years.

129
00:08:13,214 --> 00:08:15,811
He was an 18th century dandy.

130
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:18,609
So, he can be very fussy.

131
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,191
He nags and nags...

132
00:08:20,221 --> 00:08:25,817
The lunch the other day and
it was blood all over my nice antique couch.

133
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:27,619
Which one, the red one?

134
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:29,491
Well, it's red now, yah.

135
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:32,384
If you're going to eat a victim
on my nice clean couch

136
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:34,401
put down some newspaper on the floor

137
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:37,261
and some towels.
It's not hard to do.

138
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:40,122
We're vampires!
We don't put down towels.

139
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:41,924
Some vampires do.

140
00:08:42,124 --> 00:08:44,206
Well, not serious ones!

141
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:47,410
When you get 4 vampires in a flat

142
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,393
obviously there's going to be
a lot of tension.

143
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:53,466
There's tension in any,
any flatting situation.

144
00:08:53,476 --> 00:08:58,311
It's settled then. We all do our jobs,
starting with a certain Deacon...

145
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:01,164
I will do my dishes!

146
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:22,567
This is bullshit.

147
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:04,892
Well, I became a vampire when I was 16.

148
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:07,875
That is why I always look 16.

149
00:10:08,396 --> 00:10:12,520
In those days, of course,
life was tough for a 16 year old.

150
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:25,754
Vampires have had a pretty bad rec.

151
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:30,439
We're not these mopey
old creatures who live in castles.

152
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:33,682
And while some, most of us are,
a lot are... bats.

153
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:36,936
There are also, those of us,
who like to flat together in

154
00:10:36,946 --> 00:10:38,908
really small countries like New Zealand.

155
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:51,882
I was a Nazi vampire.

156
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,472
After the war, which the Nazi's lost...

157
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:05,136
I don't know,
if you know that the Nazi's lost...

158
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,237
... that war.

159
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:08,459
If you were a Nazi, after the war...

160
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,703
...and if you were a vampire...

161
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:16,928
... and if you were a Nazi vampire...

162
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,660
No way.

163
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,282
I was out of there.

164
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:07,552
Yah, I came to this country for love.

165
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:11,025
Uh, there was a girl. Human girl.

166
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:12,567
And...

167
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:13,708
... I...

168
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:16,151
... thought she was fantastic.
She was...

169
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:17,662
... absolutely amazing.

170
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,344
I was smitten.

171
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:23,168
Her family emigrated to New Zealand.

172
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:25,240
And, I thought,

173
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,962
'you know what, to hell with it.

174
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:30,496
I'm gonna go. I'm going to chase her
and tell her how I feel.'

175
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:32,298
I told my servant Phillip,

176
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:34,660
'Send me to New Zealand.'

177
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,491
He...

178
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:38,034
... put the wrong postage on my coffin.

179
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:41,488
So the whole journey took about 18 months.

180
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,392
And when I got here, she had...

181
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:47,574
... found someone else.

182
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:50,948
She had fallen in love.

183
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:53,020
And...

184
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,082
She was married.

185
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:08,396
She gave me this before she left.

186
00:13:10,418 --> 00:13:11,840
There she is.

187
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:15,914
That's me, I put myself in there too.

188
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:20,008
She told me in was pure silver.

189
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,331
Unfortunately...

190
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:25,044
... we vampires can not wear silver.

191
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:47,628
Yeah...

192
00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:51,832
It's about as long as I can wear that.

193
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,913
Tonight, we are going out
into Wellington center.

194
00:14:21,113 --> 00:14:22,935
It is important that we look good.

195
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,176
Yeah, it's really good. Yeah.

196
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:29,482
One of the unfortunate things about
not having a reflection is that you...

197
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:31,814
... don't know exactly what you look like.

198
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:34,637
Look!

199
00:14:34,717 --> 00:14:36,749
A ghost cup!

200
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,733
Floating all by itself!

201
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,436
We can give each other feedback and

202
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:45,188
help each other out until
we're looking great.

203
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:47,721
Yes, some of our clothes are from victims.

204
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,823
We might bite someone and then...

205
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:52,636
... you think,
'ooh, those are some nice pants!'.

206
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:53,938
- Do work these?
- NO!

207
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:54,678
Change it!

208
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:57,642
When you are a vampire,
you become very sexy.

209
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:04,499
We are trying to attract victims to us.

210
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:06,020
Not sure about the waist coat.

211
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,424
I go for a look which I call
Dead But Delicious.

212
00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:11,326
We are the bait.

213
00:15:11,526 --> 00:15:13,528
But we're also the trap.

214
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,370
Hello, ladies.

215
00:15:37,043 --> 00:15:40,547
And my love, we are ready to go
into town and party!

216
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:42,549
Vampire... vampire style.

217
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,122
When we go into town,
we must try to blend in.

218
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:56,354
We are walking the streets.

219
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:59,197
Coming into town.
Um, it's really cool because

220
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:00,858
just for one brief moment

221
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:01,704
I feel...

222
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:02,550
Homos!

223
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:12,301
The trouble with being a vampire is you

224
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,623
have to be invited in, to go in.

225
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:17,326
We would like to come into the bar, please.

226
00:16:17,526 --> 00:16:19,328
Invite us into the bar, please.

227
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:21,195
Keep walking.

228
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:22,862
You invite us in!

229
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:25,354
If the humans find out what we were...

230
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:27,677
... they would destroy us.

231
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:32,152
There are between 60 and 70 vampires
in the greater Wellington region.

232
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:34,044
- Obvious vampire.
- Joline!

233
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:34,724
Hello!

234
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:36,066
How embarrassing.

235
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:39,089
He's a guy I used to work with
when I was human.

236
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,461
- Is he gone?
- Yeah, he's gone.

237
00:16:41,662 --> 00:16:43,283
I've been draining him all night.

238
00:16:43,484 --> 00:16:45,085
Been a very thirsty girl.

239
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:47,778
Being bitten as a little boy
or a little girl

240
00:16:47,978 --> 00:16:49,560
you always going to look the same age.

241
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,891
What are you doing tonight?

242
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,023
Going to kill some perverts?

243
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,385
- Yeah, we're meeting a pedophile.
- Cool.

244
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:55,827
Okay, let's just go please.

245
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:57,749
- Have a good night, guys!
- Yeah, you have a good night!

246
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:00,403
The Big Kumara is vampire
owned and operated,

247
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:02,434
and so we could always get in.

248
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:06,067
It's the hottest night spot
for vampires in Wellington.

249
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:08,860
- Come on in, guys, come on in.
- Thank you.

250
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,082
Perhaps you could bring
some people to the house.

251
00:17:20,152 --> 00:17:22,465
- Sure.
- Perhaps some virgins?

252
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:23,946
Virgins? Yep, okay.

253
00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:26,769
Any kind of preference
in terms of gender or?

254
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,241
Maybe some ladies?

255
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:29,462
Yep. Ladies.

256
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:31,424
Perhaps a guy?

257
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:32,926
One of each?

258
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:34,427
One of each should be cool.

259
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:37,321
My relationship with Deacon is...

260
00:17:37,661 --> 00:17:39,763
... well, I'm his familiar.
He's my Master.

261
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:43,237
He tells me what to do, I do it.

262
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:48,412
We have the kind of master-servant
relationship which works nicely.

263
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:48,933
Actually.

264
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:49,924
- Hello!
- Hello.

265
00:17:50,004 --> 00:17:50,995
Oh, it's a little bit of blood.

266
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,028
Um, my husband, he's a,
he's a hemophiliac.

267
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:56,150
You know, someone who bleeds a lot.

268
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:56,721
Yeah.

269
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,533
Any kind of age range?

270
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:01,186
- Young.
- But not, not kids?

271
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:02,497
Not kids.

272
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,179
18 to 30?

273
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:06,732
Definitely younger than yourself.

274
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:08,734
Okay, so 18 to 30.

275
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:09,875
So it's a dinner party?

276
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:10,816
- I'll be there?
- Yes!

277
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:12,378
- Dinner party.
- The guys we'll be there?

278
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:12,648
Yes.

279
00:18:12,848 --> 00:18:14,130
- We will all be there?
- Yes, we will dress up.

280
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,752
- Okay, great.
- And then... eat them.

281
00:18:17,153 --> 00:18:19,055
- Should be fun.
- Okay, great.

282
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:21,227
I was just wondering
if we could talk about the...

283
00:18:21,427 --> 00:18:23,690
You don't know of a night dentist?

284
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,371
Because I have this thing here.

285
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:28,325
I was just wondering if
we could talk about the deal.

286
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:29,656
- Hm?
- The deal.

287
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:32,949
- The dishes?
- No, the...

288
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,574
The deal is that he is going
to give me eternal life.

289
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:39,636
Um, which is...

290
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,149
... very exciting.

291
00:18:42,209 --> 00:18:44,041
Well, I just feel like I kind of
reached my potential and

292
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:46,624
I wouldn't want to kind of,
get any older before, I kind of...

293
00:18:46,704 --> 00:18:49,207
I just feel like I'm the best version
of myself that I can be.

294
00:18:49,257 --> 00:18:51,249
It's just that it's been
4 and a half years and I just

295
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:53,051
I just want... doing your plans and...

296
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:55,533
Doing your dry-cleaning.
Now I'm doing your dishes.

297
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:57,035
Yeah... the dentist?

298
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,098
And the dentist and it's just taking an
awful long time, so I was just wondering...

299
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:02,100
- Be gone!
- Okay.

300
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:04,663
- I see you later!
- Okay.

301
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:19,479
One of the most unfortunate things
about being a vampire is that...

302
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,922
... you have to drink human blood.

303
00:19:23,123 --> 00:19:25,125
I like to make a real evening of it.

304
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:27,537
Play some music.

305
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:30,330
Maybe give them some nice wine.

306
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,525
It's their last moment alive so
why not make it a nice experience.

307
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:37,918
So...

308
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:40,100
Tell we what you do, what do you...

309
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:41,882
I was thinking about
going back to Uni, actually.

310
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,414
Oh, you are?
Lets put this over

311
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:44,605
there.

312
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:48,630
University, yeah?

313
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,372
Yeah, but after that,
I'm gonna travel.

314
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:52,343
Yeah...

315
00:19:52,544 --> 00:19:55,347
I really wanted
to go over seas for ages, so..

316
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:58,059
Saving out and I'm gonna go to Spain and

317
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,402
Italy and London and...

318
00:20:00,642 --> 00:20:01,663
Yeah.

319
00:20:03,896 --> 00:20:05,918
Okay. Excuse me.

320
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:08,140
Just put that there.

321
00:20:13,276 --> 00:20:15,087
There we go.

322
00:20:23,346 --> 00:20:24,377
Shit!

323
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:34,278
Well, that didn't go so great.

324
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:37,541
Um, I hit the main artery.

325
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:42,026
So, yeah, it's a real mess in there, um...

326
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:45,940
On the upside,
I think she had a really good time.

327
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:05,831
So, it's quite late and uh...

328
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,795
I've managed to find a woman up,
watching television.

329
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:13,199
And, uh, she seems like
she'd be a good victim.

330
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,393
I'm just going to use hypnosis on her...

331
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:21,588
See me...

332
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,452
See me...

333
00:21:27,154 --> 00:21:30,267
She can't, she can't see me
from that angle.

334
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,180
Vladislav used to be extremely powerful.

335
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,643
He could hypnotize crowds of people.

336
00:21:35,803 --> 00:21:38,606
Great orgies. 20-30 women.

337
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,768
He could turn into all sorts of animals.

338
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,870
But now he never get the faces right.

339
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:45,813
He would kill anybody.
Men, women.

340
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:49,157
Children. Burning... everything.

341
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:50,298
It was totally great.

342
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:53,942
But he suffered a humiliating defeat...

343
00:21:54,082 --> 00:21:56,665
... at the hands of his arch nemesis...

344
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:58,667
... The Beast.

345
00:22:06,555 --> 00:22:08,718
And, he's never been the same.

346
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:10,400
See me...

347
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:14,364
See me...

348
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:17,978
See me...

349
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:21,932
See me...

350
00:22:23,523 --> 00:22:25,856
Would you like to come inside?

351
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,342
Ah!

352
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:52,624
- Jackie, welcome! Come in.
- Hello.

353
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:55,958
This is Nick. Ex-ex boyfriend.

354
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:57,339
- And Josefine.
- Nice house.

355
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:00,352
And this is Deacon,
my over seas friend from Europe.

356
00:23:00,593 --> 00:23:03,145
Deacon and his friends need...

357
00:23:03,235 --> 00:23:04,006
... victims.

358
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:06,534
Hi! Please come in, welcome.

359
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:09,062
There can't be people that...

360
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:11,534
... I actually

361
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:15,058
envious them or like because of course
they will become victims.

362
00:23:15,108 --> 00:23:17,140
Hi! Josefine?

363
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,553
No, I sat next to you in English.
Remember?

364
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:22,476
Um, you used to call me the Jacksersist?

365
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,748
No you did, no you did. Yeah.

366
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:26,480
No, you started that.

367
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:30,324
You were the one who started calling me that
and then it kind of caught on.

368
00:23:30,825 --> 00:23:31,505
Yeah.

369
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:34,248
Okay, bye then. Bye.

370
00:23:34,338 --> 00:23:35,249
She's in.

371
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:41,276
You like that, Nick?

372
00:23:41,576 --> 00:23:43,298
Yep, it's nice.

373
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,203
I will go and prepare dinner.

374
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:53,459
Nick, are you a virgin at all?

375
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:54,730
Um, what?

376
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,873
Doesn't seem like... are, are you a virgin?

377
00:23:57,953 --> 00:24:00,116
- Yes.
- Um, no.

378
00:24:00,616 --> 00:24:02,488
You were a virgin when
we were seeing each other?

379
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:03,719
Yeah, I was 12.

380
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,161
You said he was a virgin.

381
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:08,024
I think we drink virgin blood because...

382
00:24:08,304 --> 00:24:09,526
... it sounds cool.

383
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:11,207
I think of it like this...

384
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,770
If you're going to eat a sandwich..

385
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:17,894
You will just enjoy it more if
you knew no one had fucked it.

386
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:20,547
Let's concentrate on Josefine than.

387
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:22,169
Are you a virgin?

388
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,480
I'm not, no.

389
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,102
Okay, I'm really sorry.

390
00:24:25,152 --> 00:24:26,519
Because I totally...

391
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:28,085
Him there is a Virgin.

392
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:31,138
She looks like a virgin.
She talks like a virgin, I mean...

393
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,801
Who would have sex with her, I wouldn't.

394
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:35,473
I would.

395
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:37,355
Oh.

396
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:40,338
Okay, good.

397
00:24:40,538 --> 00:24:43,391
- It's 2 dinners... yum.
- Nick.

398
00:24:43,642 --> 00:24:45,544
Do you like bisghetti?

399
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:47,716
Uh... yep.
I usually like it.

400
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:50,109
But, be better if it was warm?

401
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:51,830
So, this is my favorite trick.

402
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,434
We present our guest
with a plate of bisghetti.

403
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:59,418
And then, I would say,
' Why don't you eat some bisghetti?'

404
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:01,180
Please, Nick.

405
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,712
Eat some bisghetti.

406
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:07,647
I didn't realize you enjoy eating worms.

407
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:08,518
Nick.

408
00:25:08,568 --> 00:25:11,131
- No...
- They are worms.

409
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:13,754
There's worms moving around on my plate.

410
00:25:13,954 --> 00:25:13,964
Worm like but not actually...
There's worms moving around on my plate.

411
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:15,926
Worm like but not actually...

412
00:25:16,006 --> 00:25:18,799
We stole that idea from The Lost Boys.

413
00:25:18,949 --> 00:25:20,721
But I put a nice twist on it.

414
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:21,712
Nick.

415
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:25,106
How does it feel to
have a snake for a penis?

416
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:27,678
Jackie?

417
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:29,370
My penis has disappeared.
It's a cobra snake.

418
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,483
Nobody is gonna mistake
your penis for a cobra, Nick, okay?

419
00:25:32,493 --> 00:25:33,875
- Believe me.
- What have you put in my bisghetti?

420
00:25:33,895 --> 00:25:36,648
No, it is just a normal penis.

421
00:25:36,838 --> 00:25:38,950
I'm out. I'm out.

422
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,622
Josefine?

423
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:42,824
Do you like bisghetti?

424
00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:46,268
Look, these freaks...

425
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:50,002
... spike my bisghetti,
make my cock turn into a snake is not cool.

426
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:51,804
Not cool.

427
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,242
You don't think this is weird?

428
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:02,165
For fuck sakes...

429
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,773
Jackie?!

430
00:26:10,013 --> 00:26:11,795
Jackie!

431
00:26:11,855 --> 00:26:14,218
- Sorry Nick.
- What are you doing?!

432
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:16,380
Jackie!

433
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:23,107
Shit!

434
00:26:50,716 --> 00:26:51,837
Fuck off.

435
00:26:56,442 --> 00:26:57,643
Where am I?

436
00:27:20,287 --> 00:27:21,138
Fuck.

437
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:24,932
Fuck!

438
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:36,465
Freaks!

439
00:27:46,305 --> 00:27:47,967
Ah, no...

440
00:27:48,537 --> 00:27:49,899
Petyr got him.

441
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:51,530
Poor guy...

442
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:53,633
Who let Petyr out?

443
00:28:52,795 --> 00:28:54,157
Hey, guys!

444
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:56,960
Hey, what are you guys doing?

445
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,112
What are you doing, Nick?

446
00:28:59,262 --> 00:29:00,754
Come into the house.

447
00:29:02,015 --> 00:29:03,677
- Hi, my name is Nick.
- Hey, guys.

448
00:29:03,757 --> 00:29:05,419
I've been a vampire for 2 months.

449
00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:10,794
Probably, I reckon best thing
about being a vampire is flying.

450
00:29:11,145 --> 00:29:13,367
Like I've always wanted to,
I think everyone has always wanted to fly.

451
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:15,109
And now I can do it.

452
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:21,586
Oh...

453
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,053
Nick, why don't you use the front door?

454
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:30,575
Why would I? I'm flying.

455
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:32,447
Petyr bit me.

456
00:29:32,597 --> 00:29:33,749
Sucked all my blood out.

457
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:35,305
I woke up in his basement and...

458
00:29:35,505 --> 00:29:36,982
... he offered me some blood.

459
00:29:37,182 --> 00:29:38,394
I just thought it was something...

460
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:40,596
... some German thing that these guys do.

461
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,809
This transition, into becoming
a vampire was pretty hard.

462
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,444
I look like shit to start off with, like,
I had a massive gash on my neck.

463
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,386
Like you could see the inside of my neck.

464
00:29:50,506 --> 00:29:52,138
I had blood all over my top.

465
00:29:52,729 --> 00:29:54,811
And then I came home and
I was sweating.

466
00:29:55,011 --> 00:29:56,733
I was either really hot or really cold.

467
00:29:56,983 --> 00:29:58,895
It was like a hang-over times 10, I reckon.

468
00:29:59,095 --> 00:30:00,297
It was really bad.

469
00:30:06,623 --> 00:30:08,285
It was quite similar to having the flu.

470
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:10,898
Except, the only difference
would probably be...

471
00:30:11,168 --> 00:30:13,120
... that my eyes bleed heaps.

472
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:16,434
Are you guys not cold?

473
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:20,348
No, I can't really explain it.
It's like, yeah, really hot and cold and like...

474
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:22,610
... bloody eyes and flying and stuff.

475
00:30:22,941 --> 00:30:25,423
The neighbors can see you
flying around the house.

476
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:27,305
You want to draw attention
to his house, hm?

477
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:29,768
You got a whole...
documentary crew following you around.

478
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,930
I am doing an erotic dance for my friends.

479
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,062
And you ruined it.
I was in the zone.

480
00:30:34,263 --> 00:30:35,454
My friends are loving it.

481
00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:37,056
I love it. I saw the end of it.
It looked great.

482
00:30:37,256 --> 00:30:40,219
I don't, I don't know,
if I'm, if I'm accepted yet.

483
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:42,471
But... I don't know.
I think it's getting there.

484
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:44,814
I don't know the oldest stuff,
but they're quite naive...

485
00:30:44,904 --> 00:30:46,295
... when it comes to the real world.

486
00:30:46,786 --> 00:30:47,987
So...

487
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:49,729
I don't know,
it would be cool to just...

488
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,441
Hang out with them.
They could teach me some stuff.

489
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,573
But I could probably
teach them a few things.

490
00:31:00,931 --> 00:31:03,053
At the start it was like,
'Oh no, like I'm..'

491
00:31:03,554 --> 00:31:04,525
'... I'm dead.'

492
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:08,789
It kind of affected my friendship with
normal people, my family and stuff.

493
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:11,462
But, of the way I see it,
I've got a whole new family.

494
00:31:11,632 --> 00:31:15,486
They accept me for who I am.
They don't even seem to know who they are.

495
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,278
Even though...

496
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:18,660
... one of them killed me.

497
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,542
Where should we go tonight?

498
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,763
Let's go to the big Kumara.

499
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:24,526
Why don't we go to Boogie Wonderland?
We never get in to Boogie Wonderland.

500
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,988
My friend Richard's the bouncer.
He can get us in.

501
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:28,991
- What? Really?
- I'll invite us in.

502
00:31:29,361 --> 00:31:31,663
- Stu is game.
- He will come with us too?

503
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:33,956
Ah, this is my friend Stu.

504
00:31:34,216 --> 00:31:36,418
- Hey.
- He works in computers and stuff.

505
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:38,441
Originally he went out with my sister.

506
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,942
And then they broke up.

507
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:41,624
I didn't want her to do it, but...

508
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:42,825
It's got nothing to do with me.

509
00:31:42,895 --> 00:31:45,228
And um... he can't hear me.

510
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,661
Yeah, so basically...

511
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:50,854
Stu doesn't know that I'm a vampire.

512
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:53,156
And he doesn't know that
my friends are vampires.

513
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:54,548
He just thinks that I'm just...

514
00:31:54,778 --> 00:31:56,500
... with some powerful friends.

515
00:31:57,361 --> 00:32:01,205
I bought a room in the house and
he thought I bought a meal.

516
00:32:01,845 --> 00:32:02,676
Just like...

517
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:04,468
... it really, really sucks...

518
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:06,290
... that I can't eat him.

519
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,803
I just want to like...

520
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:12,577
Look at it.
He's the reddest guy I know.

521
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,579
Right, you can hear me.

522
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,323
- Like computer based and stuff, heh, mainly?
- Yeah, yeah.

523
00:32:18,463 --> 00:32:21,256
- Databases.
- Yeah, like computers mainly.

524
00:32:22,537 --> 00:32:25,931
Let's have a vote for Boogie Wonderland
or The Big Kumara.

525
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,703
Big Kumara!

526
00:32:29,995 --> 00:32:30,996
Wait.

527
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,369
Come on Stu, hurry up.

528
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,563
I don't think Nick should have been
turned into a vampire.

529
00:32:38,764 --> 00:32:40,346
He's such a dick.

530
00:32:42,198 --> 00:32:43,590
Looking great man!

531
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,811
You are most welcome!

532
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,222
We're in Boogie Wonderland!

533
00:32:55,422 --> 00:33:01,418
Here we are at Boogie Wonderland
and it is so much fun.

534
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,512
This is amazing!

535
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:06,574
I'm so happy to be here.

536
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:09,097
This is pretty cheesy.

537
00:33:09,297 --> 00:33:11,499
Also, did you see the jacket he wore?

538
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,892
He's wearing the same jacket as me.

539
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,494
- It's not exactly the same.
- It's pretty close.

540
00:33:23,522 --> 00:33:25,474
I'm just loving being a vampire.

541
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,322
Over there, is the big Fat Lady's Arms.

542
00:33:33,462 --> 00:33:36,345
Ah, on Wednesday's there be,
like fear factor competition.

543
00:33:36,365 --> 00:33:39,709
You can win like t-shirts and
hats and small prizes.

544
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:41,711
I can smell werewolves.

545
00:33:41,911 --> 00:33:45,895
Okay, we're just about to walk passed
some werewolves so some shit might go down!

546
00:33:45,956 --> 00:33:48,318
Look out guys. Don't catch flees.

547
00:33:48,448 --> 00:33:49,770
- What's that, mate?
- Deacon.

548
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,341
- Sorry what?
- Keep going, keep walking.

549
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:53,604
- Keep walking!
- We heard that, mate. We've got sensitive hearing.

550
00:33:53,624 --> 00:33:54,495
- Have you?
- Yeah.

551
00:33:54,695 --> 00:33:56,397
What are you filming?
It's a music video, is it?

552
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:58,188
We don't want any trouble.

553
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:00,991
- Why did you start it?
- Well, I do. Have I got your heckles up?

554
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:01,512
Huh?

555
00:34:01,592 --> 00:34:03,874
Why don't you girls smell
your own crutches, huh?

556
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,122
- Come on. It's not worth it.
- What are you talking about?

557
00:34:06,322 --> 00:34:08,369
We don't smell our own crutches.
We smell each others crutches.

558
00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:10,371
And it's a... form of... greeting.

559
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:12,093
Your own camera, mate, don't, don't...

560
00:34:12,293 --> 00:34:12,504
What?

561
00:34:12,554 --> 00:34:14,235
It's okay, cause I know this guy.

562
00:34:14,436 --> 00:34:15,447
It's count Fagula.

563
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:18,360
Hey, hey, hey! Don't swear.

564
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,462
- Sorry... they... they...
- We're werewolves.

565
00:34:20,662 --> 00:34:21,473
- Not swearwolves.
- What are we?

566
00:34:21,763 --> 00:34:23,395
We're werewolves, not swearwolves.

567
00:34:23,675 --> 00:34:26,959
- No, listen, that's offensive...
- That's a really offensive word to call people.

568
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:29,291
Well, at least you're talking
about a bundle of sticks.

569
00:34:29,371 --> 00:34:30,963
Please, this bundle of sticks...

570
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:31,844
Werewolves?

571
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:34,637
- No, no, no!
- Don't get it! Nathan it's not real.

572
00:34:34,837 --> 00:34:36,299
He's just gonna take of his gloves.

573
00:34:36,499 --> 00:34:38,531
Ah, shit, man!
Why the fuck did you do that for?

574
00:34:38,731 --> 00:34:41,955
Hey! Don't swear.
We're gonna lose it. We're gonna lose it.

575
00:34:42,155 --> 00:34:42,776
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey.

576
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:43,747
Calm down. Calm down!

577
00:34:43,947 --> 00:34:45,348
- Get the fuck my glasses!
- Dion! Dion!

578
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:50,254
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

579
00:34:51,295 --> 00:34:52,706
Do the breathing! Do the breathing.

580
00:34:52,906 --> 00:34:55,029
Do the breathing.
Count to 10, mate. Count to 10.

581
00:34:55,229 --> 00:34:56,700
- Come on.
- Hold it.

582
00:34:56,901 --> 00:34:58,372
Count to 10, human again.

583
00:34:58,462 --> 00:35:00,054
- 10, human again.
- It's alright. It's not full moon.

584
00:35:00,124 --> 00:35:01,125
Thanks a lot guys.

585
00:35:01,455 --> 00:35:03,468
- Enjoy your night, yah?
- You should be ashamed of yourselves, man.

586
00:35:03,538 --> 00:35:04,959
Great, we didn't want this to happen.

587
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:12,998
- Come on guys.
- Hey!

588
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:15,200
Say it! Don't spray it, bitch!

589
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,141
Declan!

590
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:18,904
- Why are you swearing all the time?!
- Well, he ride with me...

591
00:35:19,104 --> 00:35:20,906
- Were they actually werewolves?
- Yeah.

592
00:35:21,106 --> 00:35:22,908
Are you okay, Stu?

593
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,123
I just don't really know how to...

594
00:35:27,243 --> 00:35:29,255
... approach this,
cause I never done it before.

595
00:35:29,685 --> 00:35:31,848
Um, and he is a good friend.

596
00:35:32,058 --> 00:35:33,349
And I don't wanna...

597
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,762
... I don't want to break
that friendship but..

598
00:35:35,932 --> 00:35:39,376
... then again, what do you do when
someone tells you, that they're a vampire?

599
00:35:40,357 --> 00:35:42,188
I'm expecting him to be angry.

600
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:46,053
He might be scared and expecting
lot of things to, to bubble to the surface.

601
00:35:46,803 --> 00:35:48,395
You probably noticed, it has been...

602
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:52,079
... I've been going through
a few changes lately.

603
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,001
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

604
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:54,702
Yeah.

605
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:56,093
Like...

606
00:35:56,384 --> 00:35:58,266
I don't show up for lunch anymore.

607
00:35:59,136 --> 00:36:00,658
- Yeah.
- Have...

608
00:36:00,818 --> 00:36:03,381
... changed the story of
all of Tina's games.

609
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:04,862
The night time, Tina's games.

610
00:36:04,923 --> 00:36:05,713
Right...

611
00:36:06,084 --> 00:36:07,726
And how you went from beating me

612
00:36:07,926 --> 00:36:09,728
every time and how I

613
00:36:09,928 --> 00:36:11,730
I've won the last 3?

614
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:13,872
Yeah.

615
00:36:14,192 --> 00:36:14,983
So...

616
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:16,685
The reason I brought you here...

617
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:19,418
... is to tell you that...

618
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,971
... I'm a vampire.

619
00:36:25,654 --> 00:36:26,806
Stu took it pretty well.

620
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:29,008
He's definitely my best mate.

621
00:36:29,138 --> 00:36:30,430
And I'm not gonna eat him.

622
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,231
But if they ever offer you bisghetti...

623
00:36:32,261 --> 00:36:34,454
Um... you shouldn't eat it.

624
00:36:36,116 --> 00:36:37,958
They offered me biscotti.

625
00:36:38,518 --> 00:36:40,600
Vampire mates don't eat human mates.

626
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,713
And no matter how much I want to eat him...

627
00:36:42,773 --> 00:36:44,605
... I will never eat him cause he's my mate.

628
00:36:44,845 --> 00:36:46,627
- Right, Stu?
- Yah.

629
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:47,998
Yeah.

630
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,773
Stu is great.

631
00:36:53,884 --> 00:36:55,326
We really like him.

632
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:57,959
At first I wanted to kill him.

633
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:01,482
But now I'm glad I've spent
the time to get to know him.

634
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:05,537
Yeah, of course he looks delicious
with his big red cheeks.

635
00:37:05,737 --> 00:37:09,691
But we've all got an agreement
that we're not going to eat Stu.

636
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:11,253
- Right?
- Right.

637
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:13,976
The guys upstairs, they...
They're loving him.

638
00:37:14,156 --> 00:37:15,602
That's... it started off with,

639
00:37:15,702 --> 00:37:17,680
'Who's this human you're
bringing into the house?'

640
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,501
But it took them literally 2 minutes and

641
00:37:19,702 --> 00:37:21,704
they like him more than
they like me, I reckon.

642
00:37:22,234 --> 00:37:24,597
I'm knitting a scarf for Stu.

643
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:27,390
Try it again. Use your legs.

644
00:37:28,821 --> 00:37:29,882
Wow.

645
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,576
- Step back...
- Punching high.

646
00:37:33,977 --> 00:37:35,358
- Yep.
- Hi.

647
00:37:35,558 --> 00:37:35,819
Yep.

648
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:37,501
I'm just, what I'm trying to say is...

649
00:37:38,031 --> 00:37:39,453
... cause I know that you...

650
00:37:39,683 --> 00:37:40,954
... you turned me into a vampire.

651
00:37:41,335 --> 00:37:43,217
Maybe don't do that to him.

652
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:45,179
He's a... vegetarian.

653
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,031
Last thing he'd want to is eat...

654
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,994
... a life-being or eat blood or eat meat...

655
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:52,737
- I am controlling this.
- Get it, get it!

656
00:37:52,807 --> 00:37:57,051
Quite amazing to see how far
technology can go forward

657
00:37:57,161 --> 00:37:59,103
if you're not paying attention.

658
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:02,527
One message received.

659
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:09,534
There is a crucifix behind you.

660
00:38:09,594 --> 00:38:12,267
So, done on it, or like,
half way down and focus it.

661
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:13,228
Maybe smile.

662
00:38:18,123 --> 00:38:20,766
- Anything you want to find, you...
- Yeah.

663
00:38:20,856 --> 00:38:23,169
- You can type your name here.
- I've lost...

664
00:38:23,189 --> 00:38:27,644
... a really nice silk scarf in about 1912.

665
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:28,775
Yes, now Google it.

666
00:38:28,815 --> 00:38:33,410
Stu is the first human friend
that I've had for long time.

667
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,483
With humans there's a tendency to die.

668
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:38,805
Yeah.

669
00:38:39,006 --> 00:38:40,307
We can look at her photos.

670
00:38:40,507 --> 00:38:42,669
- Ah, oh yes.
- Or you can poke her.

671
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:46,243
Yes.

672
00:38:46,644 --> 00:38:49,076
Can we see a movie with sunrise?

673
00:38:50,618 --> 00:38:52,350
- What? Shit!
- Whoo...

674
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,911
Nice...

675
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:57,345
If you push images,
than we can see pictures of virgins.

676
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,347
- Ah, yes. Yes.
- Yah, yah...

677
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,714
I don't think she's a virgin
if she's doing that.

678
00:39:19,168 --> 00:39:20,449
There he is, yeah.

679
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,882
This is my old servant, Phillip.

680
00:39:22,992 --> 00:39:25,235
- So, we're gonna call him.
- Yeah.

681
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:26,656
And...

682
00:39:26,746 --> 00:39:28,528
...screen...

683
00:39:32,692 --> 00:39:35,555
My God, that's him, that's him,
that's him, that's Phillip, that's Phillip.

684
00:39:35,756 --> 00:39:37,558
He looks old.

685
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:16,172
Yeah, kind of like youth romance,
but like more, more layers.

686
00:41:16,192 --> 00:41:18,534
Maybe Twilight, have you seen it?

687
00:41:18,985 --> 00:41:22,218
Okay, I'm the main guy in Twilight.
You now the main guy?

688
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:23,299
Twilight?

689
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,561
That's me.

690
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:25,932
Cameras following me around.

691
00:41:25,962 --> 00:41:26,933
They could have chosen anyone.

692
00:41:27,133 --> 00:41:29,396
How many people have you told
you are a vampire?

693
00:41:29,526 --> 00:41:31,588
- Not many.
- I heard that girl...

694
00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:34,541
... talking about that
you said you were a vampire.

695
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,552
Yeah, I told her.

696
00:41:35,622 --> 00:41:37,074
- Who else?
- Who did you tell?

697
00:41:37,274 --> 00:41:38,656
Uh, I told her hot friend.

698
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,679
You can't tell everyone
that you're a vampire.

699
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:42,360
Who's that guy?

700
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,707
I don't know but I told him.

701
00:41:44,907 --> 00:41:47,055
You can't tell everyone.

702
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,022
Yeah, I've got a bit of an eye condition.

703
00:41:54,362 --> 00:41:55,213
What's wrong with him?

704
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,736
Um, vampire eyes.
Can't go into the sun.

705
00:41:58,437 --> 00:42:00,459
Oh, my God, is that your fangs?

706
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:01,640
For real?

707
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,092
For real, real.

708
00:42:03,302 --> 00:42:04,623
For real, real.

709
00:42:04,873 --> 00:42:06,075
I'm a vampire.

710
00:42:06,165 --> 00:42:07,306
- What?
- Yeah.

711
00:42:07,556 --> 00:42:10,419
- I'm a vampire hunter.
- No, you're not.

712
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:12,301
- No?
- You fucking piece of shit.

713
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:13,773
I'll Skype you!

714
00:42:13,853 --> 00:42:14,534
I float.

715
00:42:14,734 --> 00:42:16,275
- I transform into stuff.
- Same.

716
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,728
- No you can't.
- Yeah.

717
00:42:18,928 --> 00:42:20,430
I'll show you.

718
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,953
Show me.
Show me some of your vampire stuff.

719
00:42:23,153 --> 00:42:24,074
What have I got?
Um...

720
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,912
Don't lie about transforming into shit.

721
00:42:38,629 --> 00:42:41,102
- Twilight!
- Shut up, Nick!

722
00:42:41,853 --> 00:42:43,074
You're not Twilight.

723
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:45,396
- What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

724
00:42:45,577 --> 00:42:47,609
Telling the world that we are vampires.

725
00:42:47,669 --> 00:42:49,371
And I'll tell the whole world
that you're an asshole now.

726
00:42:49,571 --> 00:42:50,472
Shut up!

727
00:42:51,603 --> 00:42:52,234
- Shut up!
- Guys?

728
00:42:52,434 --> 00:42:53,630
- You shut up!
- No, you shut up!

729
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,027
- No, you shut up.
- You shut up.

730
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:56,038
I'm Dracula, man!

731
00:42:56,238 --> 00:42:57,569
You're not Dracula!
- I'm Dracula!

732
00:42:57,769 --> 00:42:59,101
You don't even know who Dracula is!

733
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:00,042
You idiot!

734
00:43:03,606 --> 00:43:06,699
- Oh, bat fight!
- Bat fight! Oh, yah, yah, yah!

735
00:43:14,197 --> 00:43:15,768
Ah, Deacon!

736
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,162
That wasn't fair, man!

737
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:20,423
My fucking jacket, man!

738
00:43:20,624 --> 00:43:22,626
I don't care about your stupid jacket.

739
00:43:24,247 --> 00:43:26,500
- Deacon!
- You okay, man?

740
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,059
- Hey, Stu?
- Mm-hm?

741
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,013
How's your worms?

742
00:43:48,453 --> 00:43:49,524
Alright.

743
00:43:49,654 --> 00:43:51,486
You're eating worms.

744
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:59,024
Can you do that shit when
you turn them into worms?

745
00:43:59,064 --> 00:44:00,015
No.

746
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:01,056
Doesn't work on chips.

747
00:44:01,257 --> 00:44:04,120
Only works on things that
already look like worms.

748
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,713
- Maybe noodles. Do you want some noodles?
- He knows now.

749
00:44:09,205 --> 00:44:11,137
Oh no. I wouldn't eat that.

750
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,971
Why?

751
00:44:25,492 --> 00:44:27,084
Are you okay Nick?

752
00:44:28,255 --> 00:44:29,937
Alright?

753
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:37,515
He ate fried chip.

754
00:44:37,725 --> 00:44:39,607
I can't eat salads now, great.

755
00:44:39,797 --> 00:44:41,109
I can't sunbath.

756
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:42,730
I can't watch daytime TV.

757
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:44,803
I can if I could, or I guess I could.

758
00:44:45,223 --> 00:44:46,975
More, more then ever just the chips.

759
00:44:47,195 --> 00:44:48,897
My favorite food.
I can't eat chips.

760
00:44:50,128 --> 00:44:51,660
I don't... it's just...

761
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,621
I hate...

762
00:44:52,781 --> 00:44:54,793
I said it. I'm over being a vampire.
It's shit.

763
00:44:55,424 --> 00:44:57,086
So, don't, don't believe the hype.

764
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:15,145
Jackie?!

765
00:45:18,068 --> 00:45:19,389
Jackie, can I come in please?

766
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:21,592
- Okay, off to bed, guys!
- Hello, children!

767
00:45:21,682 --> 00:45:24,274
- Don't look at the men.
- You want me to kill this?

768
00:45:24,475 --> 00:45:26,277
Don't look at the men!

769
00:45:26,997 --> 00:45:28,749
I was going to bite you tonight.

770
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,640
Really?

771
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,843
But now I can't because
there's this Nick being a vampire.

772
00:45:33,044 --> 00:45:35,036
Sorry, sorry, I thought you
killed him 2 months ago.

773
00:45:35,236 --> 00:45:37,038
No, I didn't...no... he's a vampire.

774
00:45:37,058 --> 00:45:37,949
What do you mean?

775
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:39,871
He jumped in front of your place.

776
00:45:41,252 --> 00:45:43,385
All I'm saying is that, um...

777
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:45,817
You know if I had a penis,
I would have been...

778
00:45:46,017 --> 00:45:47,519
I would have been bitten years ago.

779
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:49,371
I might have to penalize you.

780
00:45:50,943 --> 00:45:53,605
Perhaps another couple of years.
Maybe 10 years.

781
00:45:53,686 --> 00:45:54,306
Hm?

782
00:45:54,526 --> 00:45:57,019
Like one big circle,
just biting each others dicks.

783
00:45:57,169 --> 00:45:59,692
You know, they don't even wear shirts,
they wear blouses. It's, it's just...

784
00:45:59,892 --> 00:46:02,215
... a big homo-erotic dick biting club.

785
00:46:02,415 --> 00:46:05,758
And I'm stuck here,
ironing their fucking frills.

786
00:46:05,939 --> 00:46:07,520
Also clean the bathroom, please.

787
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,883
It's blood everywhere.
It is gruesome.

788
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:12,666
Okay, see you tomorrow.

789
00:46:17,431 --> 00:46:18,732
Off to bed, please.

790
00:46:31,726 --> 00:46:33,528
Katherine.

791
00:46:34,108 --> 00:46:36,271
She was so charming and nice.

792
00:46:36,471 --> 00:46:38,473
She was everything I wanted.

793
00:46:38,603 --> 00:46:40,195
Unfortunately...

794
00:46:40,395 --> 00:46:42,397
... yeah, she was married.

795
00:46:42,597 --> 00:46:44,720
Sure, I wanted to kill the guy.

796
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,242
I thought about, chopping his head off.

797
00:46:47,392 --> 00:46:50,826
Draining him of every
drop of blood that he had.

798
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:52,187
Who wouldn't?

799
00:46:53,309 --> 00:46:56,762
But then, I also saw
how happy she was.

800
00:46:57,853 --> 00:47:00,336
And that made me kind of happy.

801
00:47:01,117 --> 00:47:03,890
And I didn't want to ruin it for her, so...

802
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,093
I did the honorable thing and I just...

803
00:47:07,253 --> 00:47:08,675
... stepped back.

804
00:47:08,925 --> 00:47:10,947
And let her live her life.

805
00:47:36,404 --> 00:47:37,565
Petyr!

806
00:47:38,306 --> 00:47:38,977
Petyr!

807
00:47:39,177 --> 00:47:40,138
Where is it?

808
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:41,259
Petyr!

809
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,341
Petyr!

810
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:43,362
Petyr!

811
00:47:45,694 --> 00:47:46,935
Get water!

812
00:47:47,696 --> 00:47:50,149
- Get out of the sunlight!
- Get water! Get water!

813
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:52,481
Get water! Petyr,
get away from the sunlight!

814
00:47:52,681 --> 00:47:54,483
Get in the shadows, Petyr!

815
00:47:54,493 --> 00:47:56,025
Get out of the sunlight!

816
00:47:57,126 --> 00:47:58,878
Get out of my way!

817
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:00,775
I'm going in!

818
00:48:00,975 --> 00:48:01,871
I'm coming Petyr!

819
00:48:02,071 --> 00:48:04,114
- Deacon, no, it's sunlight!
- I'm coming for you!

820
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,226
It's sunlight out there!

821
00:48:06,246 --> 00:48:09,479
It's sunlight!

822
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:16,647
I was too late.

823
00:48:25,496 --> 00:48:27,298
Turn that thing off.

824
00:48:28,229 --> 00:48:31,332
Our friend had just been killed
in a fatal sunlight accident.

825
00:48:46,408 --> 00:48:48,320
So this is what I think happened.

826
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:50,583
The vampire hunter...

827
00:48:50,763 --> 00:48:52,675
... broke into the window here.

828
00:48:53,676 --> 00:48:57,150
Has impacted the table.
Breaking the table leg.

829
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,462
Then he has come this way.

830
00:49:00,093 --> 00:49:02,035
Towards the tomb.

831
00:49:03,246 --> 00:49:04,037
Crucifix!

832
00:49:04,227 --> 00:49:05,879
Cover the crucifix!

833
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:09,823
And then...

834
00:49:10,254 --> 00:49:12,546
... Petyr has burst from the tomb.

835
00:49:12,636 --> 00:49:15,719
Pushed the tomb lid
on to the vampire hunter.

836
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:18,773
And then the sunlight has come through here.

837
00:49:18,853 --> 00:49:20,584
And burned Petyr alive.

838
00:49:21,385 --> 00:49:23,548
Think this is just a table leg, which is...

839
00:49:23,908 --> 00:49:24,569
... sanded down.

840
00:49:24,769 --> 00:49:26,771
- Do you think he hand sanded that, or?
- Yes.

841
00:49:26,891 --> 00:49:28,303
Image that, stuck in your...

842
00:49:29,474 --> 00:49:31,916
It's quite shocking down here, Nick.

843
00:49:31,967 --> 00:49:34,800
Look, here's our sweet Petyr.

844
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,002
- Fucking hell.
- Burnt to a sizzle.

845
00:49:37,262 --> 00:49:40,025
- I can't figure out this.
- This is the vampire hunter.

846
00:49:40,225 --> 00:49:40,355
Is this Franco?

847
00:49:40,556 --> 00:49:42,097
- Uh, who's this guy?
- Look at this...

848
00:49:42,297 --> 00:49:44,039
... bloody head, back to front.

849
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,242
Twist it the other way,
the other way!

850
00:49:46,412 --> 00:49:48,995
Let's see who this guy is.

851
00:49:50,016 --> 00:49:52,839
- Hm, typical macho type.
- Yuck!

852
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:53,780
It is.

853
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,341
Oh, shit!

854
00:49:56,322 --> 00:49:57,333
I know that guy.

855
00:49:57,373 --> 00:49:59,265
- Actually.
- You know him?

856
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:00,747
- Yeah.
- What?

857
00:50:00,807 --> 00:50:02,489
I saw him the other night in town.

858
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:04,461
Told him I was a vampire.

859
00:50:04,661 --> 00:50:04,741
What?!

860
00:50:04,941 --> 00:50:07,184
I thought he was joking.
He said he was a vampire hunter.

861
00:50:07,234 --> 00:50:09,276
You let a vampire hunter into our house?

862
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:11,518
- I just gave him my e-mail.
- Nick!

863
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,331
Take out your tongue.

864
00:50:14,351 --> 00:50:15,903
And shove it down your ass.

865
00:50:18,296 --> 00:50:19,637
Fucking hell!

866
00:50:33,922 --> 00:50:36,154
You and your big mouth!

867
00:50:36,365 --> 00:50:37,766
It was a mistake!

868
00:50:39,368 --> 00:50:41,350
Get up and stand on this ceiling like a man.

869
00:50:48,317 --> 00:50:49,649
We can talk it out, yeah, man?

870
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:50,329
We can talk it out, mate!

871
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:52,822
- I'll kill you!
- I'm already dead!

872
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:54,954
Stu, stay back!

873
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,330
Someone's at the door.

874
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,644
Go, go.

875
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,202
Oh, shit.

876
00:51:13,144 --> 00:51:15,006
- Good evening, sir.
- Hello, police.

877
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:17,728
Hi, I'm constable O'Leary.
This is constable Minogue.

878
00:51:17,768 --> 00:51:21,352
We're just responding to a report
of a possible forced entry and also...

879
00:51:21,502 --> 00:51:23,074
... a rather large amount of shrieking.

880
00:51:23,274 --> 00:51:25,777
Just, um, wondering maybe we could come in
and just have a wee look around?

881
00:51:26,197 --> 00:51:27,279
Okay.

882
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:29,781
What's with the fellow?
What's with the camera?

883
00:51:29,991 --> 00:51:32,014
Yeah, we're obviously just here
cause there was a phone call

884
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,646
from the, a member of the public, um,
about a bit of disturbance.

885
00:51:34,847 --> 00:51:36,849
Um, some loud noises.

886
00:51:36,979 --> 00:51:38,701
- Possibly a forced entry, wasn't there?
- Um...

887
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:40,953
And, also, maybe a bit
of smoke coming out, so...

888
00:51:41,053 --> 00:51:43,496
We're just checking over the scene.
Making sure every thing's uh...

889
00:51:43,556 --> 00:51:45,578
You know, above board
sort of speaking, uh...

890
00:51:45,638 --> 00:51:47,450
Making sure no ones in danger,
that kind of thing.

891
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,303
We might go up and have a wee look up there,
if that's alright with you?

892
00:51:50,823 --> 00:51:52,966
- Come on mate, you lead the way.
- Just a little tour. Yeah.

893
00:51:54,347 --> 00:51:55,368
Okay.

894
00:51:55,508 --> 00:51:57,430
- Smells a bit weird here too, mate.
- Yeah.

895
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,002
What do you call that?

896
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:02,256
Barbecue.

897
00:52:05,229 --> 00:52:08,812
You will not notice anything
out of the ordinary.

898
00:52:09,283 --> 00:52:11,165
No, we certainly hope not.
Let's just...

899
00:52:11,205 --> 00:52:12,647
Lets just keep going.

900
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:15,099
- Hi there guys. How are yah?
- Hello.

901
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,120
Hi fellas.

902
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:18,913
We've just wondering where
all the shouting was coming from?

903
00:52:19,113 --> 00:52:20,124
That was me.

904
00:52:20,245 --> 00:52:22,287
Yeah, okay, we've had
a couple reports, okay?

905
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:24,469
A couple of people not happy
with the level of noise here.

906
00:52:24,669 --> 00:52:24,910
Okay.

907
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,601
The neighbors?

908
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:28,764
You got neighbors on either side.

909
00:52:28,864 --> 00:52:29,725
Feeling nervous.

910
00:52:29,925 --> 00:52:31,927
I've hypnotized those cops.

911
00:52:31,987 --> 00:52:35,361
I'm not a great hypothesizer
so it could wear off any second.

912
00:52:35,521 --> 00:52:38,013
I really hope that those guys
don't kill those police

913
00:52:38,073 --> 00:52:39,795
because then this means
more police will come.

914
00:52:39,995 --> 00:52:44,420
Possibly even Christians which is totally
the last things we need in this house.

915
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,893
I can see you're having a good time.
End of the day...

916
00:52:47,073 --> 00:52:48,635
... we got to keep the, uh,
the peace, okay?

917
00:52:48,835 --> 00:52:50,006
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

918
00:52:50,937 --> 00:52:52,188
See what I'm seeing?

919
00:52:52,329 --> 00:52:53,480
Is that even ok?

920
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:55,962
You're joking?

921
00:52:57,194 --> 00:52:58,645
Not a smoke alarm in sight.

922
00:52:58,755 --> 00:53:00,057
No smoke detectors, mate?

923
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:01,779
Rule number 1:

924
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:03,380
Smoke detectors.

925
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:04,041
Okay.

926
00:53:04,241 --> 00:53:06,684
Rule number 2: maybe not
so many barbeque's inside.

927
00:53:07,064 --> 00:53:08,265
- Sorry fellas.
- Okay.

928
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:11,148
- Barbeque's?
- That was really strong there, ain't it?

929
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:12,160
What kind of marinade?

930
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,581
Who's this guy?

931
00:53:14,372 --> 00:53:15,153
Um...

932
00:53:15,353 --> 00:53:18,276
It's a friend who came to our party.

933
00:53:18,476 --> 00:53:19,417
Mate, you're alright?

934
00:53:19,617 --> 00:53:21,119
- He's drunk.
- That's what I thought.

935
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:22,280
Drunk guy.

936
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,733
You can't just leave him down
here like that, okay?

937
00:53:24,873 --> 00:53:26,204
This guy's not having a good time.

938
00:53:26,405 --> 00:53:28,066
He's gonna feel terrible tomorrow morning.

939
00:53:28,267 --> 00:53:30,068
Well, he's soul is in hell, so...

940
00:53:30,209 --> 00:53:33,132
Well, I don't know where's his soul's at,
but all I am saying, where is his blanket?

941
00:53:33,312 --> 00:53:35,074
Who left the concrete on?

942
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,667
- Yeah, you can move him there?
- It's definitely not going to be comfortable.

943
00:53:37,867 --> 00:53:39,669
- Seen anything else in there?
- No, I think I've seen enough.

944
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:41,290
- Okay.
- Hang on a minute.

945
00:53:41,991 --> 00:53:43,332
What have we got here?

946
00:53:45,164 --> 00:53:46,436
- What is that?
- This?

947
00:53:46,746 --> 00:53:48,628
- Oh, this?
- Are you seeing this clearly as I can?

948
00:53:48,898 --> 00:53:50,030
Adhesive, mate.

949
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,571
That's a flammable.

950
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:53,363
And then you got a lamp on top of that.

951
00:53:53,493 --> 00:53:55,295
Directly underneath the power source.

952
00:53:55,385 --> 00:53:57,252
- That is quite bad.
- It's very bad.

953
00:53:57,452 --> 00:53:59,319
And no smoke detectors again are there?

954
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,392
- No.
- Yes, there are.

955
00:54:01,432 --> 00:54:03,534
- Yes, there are.
- Okay, that's good.

956
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:04,705
Lots to think about guys.

957
00:54:04,905 --> 00:54:07,238
- Yeah, lots to think about there guys.
- Next flat-meeting, yeah.

958
00:54:07,328 --> 00:54:09,210
Yeah, good thinking,
that's the thing, just...

959
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:11,402
- ... have a bit of dialogue about it.
- Okay.

960
00:54:11,622 --> 00:54:13,745
- They've got a really good point.
- Wait!

961
00:54:13,945 --> 00:54:14,946
Let's kill them.

962
00:54:15,246 --> 00:54:17,318
Well, let's just see what other safety...

963
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:19,591
- Stay here and then maybe we'll...
- Yeah.

964
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,552
I call into session,

965
00:54:30,673 --> 00:54:32,134
this trial of Nick,

966
00:54:32,274 --> 00:54:33,556
of Wellington.

967
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:40,393
Read the charges.

968
00:54:40,853 --> 00:54:42,715
Problems we have with Nick.

969
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:44,988
Number 1:

970
00:54:45,258 --> 00:54:47,180
You brought a human into our house.

971
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,413
- Which is a big no-no in the vampire world.
- Stu is, Stu is okay though?

972
00:54:50,423 --> 00:54:52,676
Yeah, Stu is fine, so I guess we'll just...

973
00:54:52,876 --> 00:54:54,177
... cross that one out.

974
00:54:54,588 --> 00:54:55,479
Uh...

975
00:54:59,163 --> 00:55:00,855
- Thank you Stu.
- Thank you Stu.

976
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:01,655
So...

977
00:55:01,846 --> 00:55:03,187
The new number 1:

978
00:55:03,287 --> 00:55:06,170
Nick's been telling people he's a vampire.

979
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,123
That in turn resulted in...

980
00:55:09,374 --> 00:55:12,637
... an unwanted visit from a vampire hunter.

981
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:14,018
Crime number 2:

982
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:16,221
This is quite a bigy, Nick.

983
00:55:16,511 --> 00:55:19,124
The vampire hunter who killed Petyr.

984
00:55:20,155 --> 00:55:23,408
That's... I actually should've...
that should have been crime number one

985
00:55:23,609 --> 00:55:25,411
but we wanted to build up to that.

986
00:55:25,431 --> 00:55:26,692
Number 3:

987
00:55:26,752 --> 00:55:30,346
Deacon doesn't like that
your wear the same jacket as him.

988
00:55:30,506 --> 00:55:33,699
And he would like you to find
your own original style.

989
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,312
For these crimes of which

990
00:55:36,512 --> 00:55:39,916
we the vampire council find you guilty...

991
00:55:40,066 --> 00:55:42,248
... you should be banished from our flat.

992
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:43,810
Indefinitely.

993
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,902
- Indefinitely?
- Indefinitely.

994
00:55:46,102 --> 00:55:46,853
So I can come back?

995
00:55:46,973 --> 00:55:50,377
No, no, indefinitely means
that there is no end.

996
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,438
I thought that there was no...

997
00:55:51,638 --> 00:55:54,471
No, indefinite means
that it's not a definite thing.

998
00:55:54,671 --> 00:55:56,033
Yeah, but it's long.

999
00:55:56,063 --> 00:55:57,545
Could be tomorrow, it could be 6 months.

1000
00:55:57,565 --> 00:55:59,116
NO! No, it is not tomorrow!

1001
00:55:59,316 --> 00:56:00,928
- You get about at least 6 moths.
- Banished!

1002
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:01,649
You are banished.

1003
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:04,091
But Stu, you can visit if you like.

1004
00:56:04,292 --> 00:56:05,193
Thank you.

1005
00:56:05,873 --> 00:56:07,405
For your crimes...

1006
00:56:07,735 --> 00:56:09,517
... you will be made to suffer...

1007
00:56:09,757 --> 00:56:11,029
... the procession...

1008
00:56:11,229 --> 00:56:12,130
... of shame.

1009
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,403
I asked them Nick,
I asked them not to pass that sentence.

1010
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,765
We should do this immediately.

1011
00:56:16,965 --> 00:56:18,967
- In my opinion.
- You didn't ask.

1012
00:56:19,227 --> 00:56:21,250
You didn't ask. You were saying yes.

1013
00:56:25,034 --> 00:56:26,735
- I did...
- Well, this is what's going to happen.

1014
00:56:26,936 --> 00:56:28,738
I still think it's quite extreme.

1015
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:31,941
Let us do the procession of shame.

1016
00:56:32,111 --> 00:56:32,932
Now.

1017
00:56:35,355 --> 00:56:36,791
- Shame.
- Shame!

1018
00:56:36,991 --> 00:56:38,428
Shame. Shame. Shame!

1019
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:39,309
Shame!

1020
00:56:39,419 --> 00:56:40,700
- Shame.
- Bad vampire!

1021
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,681
Shame.

1022
00:56:43,293 --> 00:56:44,514
Should we go Stu?

1023
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,361
Bye Stu.

1024
00:57:07,879 --> 00:57:09,320
That was a shame.

1025
00:57:33,236 --> 00:57:36,369
So today we have an invitation.

1026
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,452
To the big event of the year.

1027
00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:41,454
Breaking it open.

1028
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,387
They have burned the edges.

1029
00:57:43,587 --> 00:57:46,900
- Like a treasure map or something.
- It looks very authentic, doesn't it?

1030
00:57:47,521 --> 00:57:49,093
'Dearly departed...'

1031
00:57:49,443 --> 00:57:50,684
That's us.

1032
00:57:51,315 --> 00:57:54,759
'The Wellington vampire association
in conjunction with the

1033
00:57:54,959 --> 00:57:57,271
lower-hat-vampire-witch club

1034
00:57:57,471 --> 00:57:59,584
and the Kurory-zombie society

1035
00:57:59,784 --> 00:58:06,511
invite you to attend The Unholy Masquerade
on the night of the 6th of June...

1036
00:58:06,771 --> 00:58:09,764
... starting at 6 PM.'

1037
00:58:10,896 --> 00:58:12,908
- 666...
- Oh, yeah...

1038
00:58:13,108 --> 00:58:17,733
The Unholy Masquerade, of course, is great
time for the undead community of Wellington.

1039
00:58:17,743 --> 00:58:19,712
There's zombies there.

1040
00:58:19,812 --> 00:58:23,889
Vampires, banshees,
all having a dance together.

1041
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:25,611
It's all a big deal for me.

1042
00:58:26,092 --> 00:58:26,642
Love it.

1043
00:58:26,842 --> 00:58:30,406
One year I went to
The Unholy Masquerade dressed as

1044
00:58:30,426 --> 00:58:33,990
Whoopi Goldberg from Sister Act...

1045
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,093
... 1 and Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit.

1046
00:58:37,233 --> 00:58:40,607
Didn't go down so well because
she was a nun.

1047
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,121
Vampires don't like nuns.

1048
00:58:44,341 --> 00:58:46,814
Of course the big deal of
The Unholy Masquerade

1049
00:58:47,014 --> 00:58:49,747
is that every year they
announce the guest of honor.

1050
00:58:49,947 --> 00:58:51,549
And...um...

1051
00:58:51,749 --> 00:58:54,191
I don't know if
I should be saying this but...

1052
00:58:54,912 --> 00:58:56,264
I heard a little rumor

1053
00:58:56,464 --> 00:58:59,507
that the guest of honor this year...

1054
00:59:00,498 --> 00:59:02,430
... might be me.

1055
00:59:02,861 --> 00:59:04,332
The location...

1056
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:06,935
- Oh, yeah, where is it?
- Where's the location?

1057
00:59:06,955 --> 00:59:08,316
Detrol of Despair.

1058
00:59:08,346 --> 00:59:10,729
And the guest of honor will be...

1059
00:59:14,203 --> 00:59:16,155
Who is it? Show me.

1060
00:59:22,782 --> 00:59:23,623
Hm.

1061
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:26,275
Okay.

1062
00:59:26,986 --> 00:59:27,937
Okay.

1063
00:59:28,728 --> 00:59:31,871
- Okay. Okay, that's fine. That's fine.
- Okay?

1064
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:39,349
Vladislav...

1065
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,201
... has...

1066
00:59:41,401 --> 00:59:46,547
... just had a reaction to the information
that the guest of honor will be...

1067
00:59:46,747 --> 00:59:48,789
... um... The Beast.

1068
00:59:51,953 --> 00:59:54,075
The darkest part of my mind

1069
00:59:54,275 --> 00:59:56,197
is reserved to The Beast.

1070
00:59:56,397 --> 00:59:58,199
We can tell you a thing
or two about The Beast.

1071
00:59:58,399 --> 01:00:01,312
You should pray that you
never have to see The Beast.

1072
01:00:01,513 --> 01:00:02,914
This one is called The Beast.

1073
01:00:03,114 --> 01:00:06,208
And I said,
'Get you hands off my balls, Beast!'

1074
01:00:06,408 --> 01:00:08,690
He may have told you
some stories about his

1075
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,422
great battle with The Beast.

1076
01:00:10,622 --> 01:00:12,815
Yeah, oh,
'I fought The Beast on a cliff.'

1077
01:00:12,905 --> 01:00:15,477
Oh... 'I fought The Beast in a swamp.'

1078
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:19,682
'One time I fought The Beast
in the toilettes of a night club.'

1079
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:21,464
Difficult battle.

1080
01:00:21,664 --> 01:00:24,457
I hope you never see The Beast.

1081
01:00:25,498 --> 01:00:27,340
The Beast.

1082
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,322
You can't go the the ball as Blade.

1083
01:00:38,372 --> 01:00:39,583
He's a vampire hunter.

1084
01:00:39,653 --> 01:00:42,106
Yeah, but vampires love Wesley Snipes.

1085
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:43,707
It's inappropriate.

1086
01:00:43,757 --> 01:00:45,579
Okay, Vlad? The Green Jortes,

1087
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,952
or the Black Leather with the Dragon Belt?

1088
01:00:48,082 --> 01:00:50,454
- We're have a mild crises here.
- Doesn't matter which pants you were, just...

1089
01:00:50,655 --> 01:00:52,206
- What do you want with me?
- Just look at the pants Vlad!

1090
01:00:52,407 --> 01:00:52,907
Look at the pants!

1091
01:00:53,197 --> 01:00:54,499
Enough with the pants!

1092
01:00:54,519 --> 01:00:56,311
- Shit, man!
- Holy shit!

1093
01:00:56,751 --> 01:00:58,063
Oh, you look terrible.

1094
01:00:58,203 --> 01:00:59,594
The black pants.

1095
01:00:59,674 --> 01:01:00,926
Thank you. Get dressed!

1096
01:01:01,126 --> 01:01:03,408
I don't know if I feel up to it, really.

1097
01:01:03,428 --> 01:01:06,401
You don't look that great but
if you eat someone on the way...

1098
01:01:06,602 --> 01:01:07,490
If you ate a little bit?

1099
01:01:07,591 --> 01:01:09,394
You could probably wear
a mask or something.

1100
01:01:09,595 --> 01:01:12,818
Just leave me to do
my dark biding on the Internet!

1101
01:01:12,888 --> 01:01:14,039
What are you biding on?

1102
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:16,112
I'm biding on a table.

1103
01:01:16,312 --> 01:01:18,314
- Are you coming or not?
- Not.

1104
01:01:18,444 --> 01:01:20,696
I'm gonna go change.
We're leaving in 10 minutes.

1105
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:22,809
Have a good time!

1106
01:01:39,406 --> 01:01:43,501
We waited often,
without giving into that kind of...

1107
01:01:43,641 --> 01:01:46,284
stuff which I'm really sick
of that but you know...

1108
01:01:46,484 --> 01:01:48,726
It just that, it's a hard frustration...

1109
01:01:48,796 --> 01:01:50,027
takes people down.

1110
01:01:50,228 --> 01:01:52,530
Come on. Can I introduce, um...

1111
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,714
- Aaron and Alisha.
- Hi, how are you?

1112
01:01:55,914 --> 01:01:56,685
Hi.

1113
01:01:56,845 --> 01:02:00,579
- Hi.
- Less moaning guys.

1114
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:04,293
So we are at The Unholy Masquerade.

1115
01:02:04,553 --> 01:02:05,704
It's great.

1116
01:02:06,004 --> 01:02:07,416
This is my mask.

1117
01:02:08,137 --> 01:02:10,089
Which I made for the occasion.

1118
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,151
Hey!

1119
01:02:12,451 --> 01:02:14,503
- Jackie.
- Yeah!

1120
01:02:14,704 --> 01:02:16,926
- This is undead party.
- Yeah, I'm a vampire.

1121
01:02:17,126 --> 01:02:17,276
You...?

1122
01:02:17,477 --> 01:02:19,188
I'm a vampire. I'm a vampire!

1123
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,391
- Great.
- Yeah, yeah.

1124
01:02:21,591 --> 01:02:23,983
- So, um, who bit you?
- Oh, Nick.

1125
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,136
- Oh great.
- Yeah.

1126
01:02:26,336 --> 01:02:27,097
Okay.

1127
01:02:27,197 --> 01:02:28,298
Deacon!

1128
01:02:30,821 --> 01:02:33,283
Pretty rude, because she was my...

1129
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:34,074
... servant.

1130
01:02:34,274 --> 01:02:36,046
She was a pretty useless servant.

1131
01:02:36,246 --> 01:02:36,852
I wouldn't...

1132
01:02:36,952 --> 01:02:38,819
Yeah, yeah, but still,
it would have been...

1133
01:02:39,019 --> 01:02:40,571
... appreciated if you'd asked...

1134
01:02:40,771 --> 01:02:41,862
How's Stu?

1135
01:02:41,932 --> 01:02:43,134
He's good. He's here.

1136
01:02:43,334 --> 01:02:45,336
- Oh, his here?
- Stu! STU!

1137
01:02:46,487 --> 01:02:47,418
Hey, hey!

1138
01:02:47,689 --> 01:02:48,930
Hey!

1139
01:02:50,401 --> 01:02:53,475
Has anyone looked at you
like they want to eat you, at all?

1140
01:02:53,685 --> 01:02:55,096
Ah, no...

1141
01:02:55,297 --> 01:02:57,299
Can you hear me at the back?

1142
01:02:57,339 --> 01:03:00,362
On behalf of the Wellington
vampire society...

1143
01:03:00,682 --> 01:03:04,436
... uh, with lower-hat vampire
and witch club.

1144
01:03:04,636 --> 01:03:09,371
And the Kurory Zombie society,
we welcome you here tonight.

1145
01:03:09,542 --> 01:03:13,185
We're raffling a live big pet this year,
you could see

1146
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,488
the prize over here on my left.

1147
01:03:15,608 --> 01:03:16,749
It's a wonderful prize.

1148
01:03:16,949 --> 01:03:21,524
I thinks it's a 10 dollars each or
45 dollars for a book of five.

1149
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:25,438
Now without further ado,
it's my very great pleasure

1150
01:03:25,529 --> 01:03:28,932
to introduce to you
this year's guest of honor.

1151
01:03:29,052 --> 01:03:31,445
Pauline Ivanovich!

1152
01:03:33,036 --> 01:03:34,238
Thank you.

1153
01:03:37,391 --> 01:03:38,853
That's The Beast.

1154
01:03:39,053 --> 01:03:39,694
Thank you.

1155
01:03:39,724 --> 01:03:44,088
The Beast is, uh, the name
I gave to my ex-girlfriend Pauline.

1156
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:46,130
She prefers Pauline.

1157
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,144
We had a very intense relationship.

1158
01:03:49,344 --> 01:03:50,205
We were very...

1159
01:03:50,525 --> 01:03:52,657
... sexually explosive.

1160
01:03:52,827 --> 01:03:58,003
Last time I saw her, she impelled me and
called me an asshole.

1161
01:03:58,203 --> 01:03:59,074
She said...

1162
01:03:59,384 --> 01:04:02,017
... all kinds of things that really hurt me.

1163
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:05,841
And all this while I was impelled
on a lamp post.

1164
01:04:06,121 --> 01:04:11,357
Well, everyone, I will be mingling around
and I really hope that...

1165
01:04:11,918 --> 01:04:14,050
... I will meet...

1166
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:16,122
... all of you.

1167
01:04:31,849 --> 01:04:32,650
Hello.

1168
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:34,271
That's the new guy.

1169
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,693
What, what kind of vampire...
if he is a vampire.

1170
01:04:37,793 --> 01:04:39,076
Did you see his face?

1171
01:04:40,658 --> 01:04:42,190
Oh... oh.

1172
01:04:43,121 --> 01:04:45,113
- Hello!
- Hi, how are you?

1173
01:04:45,313 --> 01:04:47,345
- This is Deacon.
- Hello Deacon.

1174
01:04:47,545 --> 01:04:49,577
- This is Stu.
- Good day Stu.

1175
01:04:49,678 --> 01:04:50,989
- How are you my friend?
- Good.

1176
01:04:51,189 --> 01:04:51,970
Hi. Stu.

1177
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:54,282
You got really warm hands too.

1178
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,114
You a demon?

1179
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:59,358
- No, he's not a demon!
- I'm a software analyst.

1180
01:04:59,558 --> 01:05:02,081
- Stu, Stu, Stu...
- Am I a witch?

1181
01:05:02,281 --> 01:05:03,943
Go dance, uh, with anyone.

1182
01:05:04,143 --> 01:05:05,624
- Sure.
- Okay, take your time.

1183
01:05:05,825 --> 01:05:10,650
I like Stu. He's not vampire, or a zombie...

1184
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:12,021
- Am I a witch?
- He's not...

1185
01:05:12,221 --> 01:05:15,925
He not uh... he's neither,
he's uh... more of a human.

1186
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:20,350
Excuse me, excuse me.
Hi, Nick, hey.

1187
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:22,042
Um, Nick...

1188
01:05:22,462 --> 01:05:25,425
Do you mind if Stu is killed?

1189
01:05:25,626 --> 01:05:27,237
Uh, I don't feel real good about it.

1190
01:05:27,438 --> 01:05:31,892
Can I, can I just ask you, you know, a...

1191
01:05:32,092 --> 01:05:33,394
- ... a personal question?
- Sure.

1192
01:05:33,594 --> 01:05:36,687
Are you, um...

1193
01:05:37,949 --> 01:05:40,942
... are you, are you,
are you predeceased?

1194
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:43,264
Uh...

1195
01:05:44,175 --> 01:05:47,369
If anyone's gonna eat him is gonna be us but
we're not, we're passed it.

1196
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:48,930
They can just go fuck themselves.

1197
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:50,272
Nick! It is your fault.

1198
01:05:50,472 --> 01:05:54,506
Okay? You brought a human
into this den of vampis nest.

1199
01:05:54,706 --> 01:05:56,008
- You're not helping.
- Yes, you did.

1200
01:05:56,108 --> 01:05:56,563
Plus one.

1201
01:05:56,663 --> 01:05:58,921
Lovely talking to you,
I've got to shout off now.

1202
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,272
See you later on.

1203
01:06:05,248 --> 01:06:08,511
As soon as one vampire takes a bite,
it's a frenzy!

1204
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:09,742
- A frenzy!
- Okay, we've got to get him out.

1205
01:06:09,943 --> 01:06:11,684
Okay, follow me, follow me.

1206
01:06:11,714 --> 01:06:14,357
Excuse me, sorry guys.

1207
01:06:14,617 --> 01:06:15,478
Okay, Stu.

1208
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:18,051
Put that over your red face.

1209
01:06:18,381 --> 01:06:20,323
- Just going out for a cigarette.
- Oh, hey!

1210
01:06:20,524 --> 01:06:22,326
- Okay, not that way.
- This way.

1211
01:06:22,526 --> 01:06:24,328
- This way.
- Is there another way?

1212
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:28,802
- Get away from the vampires.
- Guys...

1213
01:06:29,003 --> 01:06:29,834
Excuse me everyone!

1214
01:06:30,034 --> 01:06:32,316
Can I have your attention please.

1215
01:06:33,127 --> 01:06:38,062
Some of the vampires forget
Unholy Masquerade rules.

1216
01:06:38,262 --> 01:06:40,064
They brought a human.

1217
01:06:40,545 --> 01:06:45,320
And they don't let us to feast on him.

1218
01:06:46,671 --> 01:06:48,463
This was a total misunderstanding.

1219
01:06:48,663 --> 01:06:52,147
There was on the invitation,
and this actually pertains to you...

1220
01:06:52,347 --> 01:06:53,639
... the invitation, it said,

1221
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,811
- plus one, but it did not specify...
- Okay.

1222
01:06:56,011 --> 01:06:57,983
- Wait, look...
- If it could be a human or

1223
01:06:58,184 --> 01:06:59,014
if it could be werewolf or...

1224
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,617
Yeah, but he could be
a vampire hunter for all we know.

1225
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:04,831
He could texting his mates, saying,
'I've got them all under one place

1226
01:07:05,031 --> 01:07:07,043
come on over.
We'll have a vampire barbecue!'

1227
01:07:07,313 --> 01:07:08,975
Well, he's not, he's not doing that.

1228
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:10,236
How do we know that?

1229
01:07:10,437 --> 01:07:12,028
He's wearing a bow-tie, look at him!

1230
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:13,019
Stu, tell them what you do.

1231
01:07:13,219 --> 01:07:15,662
Come on Stu!
Tell us what you do. Come on.

1232
01:07:15,862 --> 01:07:17,034
Tell them what you do, Stu.

1233
01:07:17,224 --> 01:07:19,296
- Hi, my name is Stu uh...
- Don't fuck it up, man.

1234
01:07:19,496 --> 01:07:21,013
- I can't hear Stu.
- Louder, louder!

1235
01:07:21,213 --> 01:07:22,730
Hi, my name is Stu, uh, I work in...

1236
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:23,430
- I can't hear...
- Louder.

1237
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:25,402
Stu can't hear, they cannot hear you.

1238
01:07:25,452 --> 01:07:27,578
Hi, my name is Stu. I'm a software analyst.

1239
01:07:27,778 --> 01:07:30,298
I work for a geographic
information system company.

1240
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:31,769
- Uh...
- Sorry, what is it?

1241
01:07:31,909 --> 01:07:33,781
I work for a company that does

1242
01:07:33,981 --> 01:07:37,645
basically we take like
business requirements from organizations.

1243
01:07:37,846 --> 01:07:41,509
Then we analyze those requirements and
then we build software

1244
01:07:41,549 --> 01:07:42,731
to fit those requirements.

1245
01:07:43,121 --> 01:07:45,193
He is a virgin. He is a virgin!

1246
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,497
- I can smell a virgin of a thousand paces.
- Go on then.

1247
01:07:48,677 --> 01:07:51,800
Take your thousand paces
and smell yourselves!

1248
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,652
I can't wait till you moan them.

1249
01:08:06,556 --> 01:08:09,439
There should be no eating of the human.

1250
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:10,820
Who are you all of a sudden?

1251
01:08:11,021 --> 01:08:13,964
You have forgotten your former lover.

1252
01:08:14,014 --> 01:08:15,636
So quickly.

1253
01:08:18,769 --> 01:08:20,050
Georgie?

1254
01:08:20,851 --> 01:08:21,852
No, not...

1255
01:08:22,052 --> 01:08:24,865
... Georgie, like, 5-years Saturday.

1256
01:08:25,065 --> 01:08:25,786
No.

1257
01:08:26,087 --> 01:08:27,558
Wait a minute.

1258
01:08:27,658 --> 01:08:29,260
Just one moment.

1259
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,301
No...

1260
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:33,114
No, I've got it,
it's coming, take it away...

1261
01:08:36,187 --> 01:08:37,499
Hello Beast.

1262
01:08:37,699 --> 01:08:38,810
Hello asshole.

1263
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:41,983
- Hey, don't call me asshole!
- Don't call me...

1264
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:45,357
... Beast. This is Vladislav. This is me ex-boyfriend.
- This is absolutely the same.

1265
01:08:45,557 --> 01:08:48,731
- You know, the one who fucked the police...
- Alright, that's old business, that's...

1266
01:08:48,931 --> 01:08:49,521
- ... personal business.
- Yeah.

1267
01:08:49,722 --> 01:08:51,764
- Nice to meet you asshole.
- This is my lover.

1268
01:08:51,964 --> 01:08:54,366
You will not feast on the blood
of the human known as Stu.

1269
01:08:54,567 --> 01:08:56,709
Listen asshole, this is a human and

1270
01:08:56,909 --> 01:08:59,051
this is the rules and
what is cameras doing here?

1271
01:08:59,252 --> 01:09:01,254
One, and then another one,
what is this?

1272
01:09:01,454 --> 01:09:02,961
They're making a documentary on...

1273
01:09:03,161 --> 01:09:04,467
This is a private secret society mate,

1274
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:07,100
you don't go bringing your
bloody cameras into everything.

1275
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,533
You will not eat Stu and
you will not eat the camera guy.

1276
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:10,685
Maybe one camera guy...

1277
01:09:10,785 --> 01:09:12,636
I'm up to bloody here,
with you at the moment.

1278
01:09:12,836 --> 01:09:15,118
And all your mates behind there,
whoever the hell they are.

1279
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:16,610
We're gonna eat the human being.

1280
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:18,682
And there's nothing
you can do about it, alright?

1281
01:09:18,882 --> 01:09:19,493
Now back off!

1282
01:09:19,693 --> 01:09:21,115
And let my misses get her way.

1283
01:09:21,315 --> 01:09:23,087
Oh, there's nothing I can do about it?

1284
01:09:23,287 --> 01:09:25,059
- That's right.
- Well, what about this?

1285
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:28,733
Diego, rip his head off.

1286
01:09:29,003 --> 01:09:30,305
What do you want?!

1287
01:09:30,715 --> 01:09:32,407
Vampire fight!

1288
01:09:33,138 --> 01:09:34,529
Get him Vladislav!

1289
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:49,395
Rip his head off!

1290
01:09:49,595 --> 01:09:50,806
He's killing him!

1291
01:09:51,006 --> 01:09:53,509
It is forbidden for vampires...

1292
01:09:53,709 --> 01:09:55,091
... to kill a vampire.

1293
01:09:57,623 --> 01:09:59,776
- What the f...
- Medic!

1294
01:10:01,117 --> 01:10:02,559
What?

1295
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:06,082
Are you okay, love?
Get out!

1296
01:10:06,433 --> 01:10:08,325
We should probably go Stu.

1297
01:10:09,256 --> 01:10:11,043
It was great to see you,

1298
01:10:11,243 --> 01:10:13,030
- Pauline.
- Asshole!

1299
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:13,891
Perfect.

1300
01:10:15,292 --> 01:10:17,424
- That was very... how we both...
- He's a murderer!

1301
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:20,543
We both, together,
equally destroyed that guy!

1302
01:10:20,743 --> 01:10:23,461
Yeah, but it was more Stu
with the giant stick!

1303
01:10:23,661 --> 01:10:26,544
I hope this doesn't make this awkward
for you and The Beast.

1304
01:10:26,995 --> 01:10:29,787
No, I think it's opened up
new possibilities.

1305
01:10:29,898 --> 01:10:31,589
Oh, no.

1306
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:34,032
Here we go again.

1307
01:10:34,232 --> 01:10:36,314
Stu, Stu, Stu, Stu!

1308
01:10:36,515 --> 01:10:38,176
Stu, Stu, STU!

1309
01:10:38,377 --> 01:10:40,459
Stu, Stu, Stu, Stu...

1310
01:10:40,659 --> 01:10:43,652
- Stuuu... Stuuu...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop!

1311
01:10:43,852 --> 01:10:44,954
Listen, listen!

1312
01:10:45,394 --> 01:10:46,595
You smell that?

1313
01:10:48,047 --> 01:10:49,468
This way.

1314
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,201
Werewolves.

1315
01:10:52,852 --> 01:10:55,555
- Oh, no.
- Look what the cat dragged in, huh?

1316
01:10:55,615 --> 01:10:58,238
- Piss off.
- Keep walking. Don't hassle us tonight.

1317
01:10:58,438 --> 01:11:00,240
There has been no hassle here.

1318
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:01,821
Well, let it stay that way.

1319
01:11:02,022 --> 01:11:03,513
Keep chaining yourselves up!

1320
01:11:03,763 --> 01:11:05,515
Guys, where's your track suite pants?

1321
01:11:05,715 --> 01:11:06,907
It was washing night.

1322
01:11:07,107 --> 01:11:09,429
My misses couldn't wash them cause
there was too much blood on them.

1323
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:11,837
When your legs expand
they go into the track suit.

1324
01:11:12,037 --> 01:11:14,245
- Oh!
- Those jeans are gonna rip completely!

1325
01:11:14,445 --> 01:11:15,966
You've lost all those trousers, guys?

1326
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:17,718
Declan, that tree's far too thin!

1327
01:11:17,918 --> 01:11:19,330
Look at it! It's like a branch!

1328
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:21,913
You don't know how big you get
when you transform!

1329
01:11:22,113 --> 01:11:23,915
That's the wrong tree for you.

1330
01:11:24,425 --> 01:11:25,286
Anton, I've...

1331
01:11:25,486 --> 01:11:27,709
Oh, no, you've forgot the combination.

1332
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:29,801
Why did you get a combination lock?

1333
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:31,212
I lost my key last time.

1334
01:11:31,323 --> 01:11:34,106
Okay, well, it's probably 4 zeros,
that's the factory setting, is it?

1335
01:11:34,306 --> 01:11:35,777
- Fuck off to a tree.
- Hey!

1336
01:11:35,978 --> 01:11:37,249
Werewolves, not swearwolves.

1337
01:11:37,449 --> 01:11:39,251
Yeah, I know, well on transformation nights,

1338
01:11:39,451 --> 01:11:41,453
it's alright, alright?
I'm getting stressed out.

1339
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:42,625
I was just reminding you.

1340
01:11:42,825 --> 01:11:45,488
Stop talking and chain yourself up
you dickhead!

1341
01:11:45,688 --> 01:11:46,889
Honestly, we're transforming.

1342
01:11:46,929 --> 01:11:48,050
Alright, we'll keep walking.

1343
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:50,961
Yeah, keep walking.
By the way I find that offensive!

1344
01:11:51,264 --> 01:11:52,265
Is it fur?

1345
01:11:52,295 --> 01:11:53,656
Oh, for crying out loud.

1346
01:11:53,826 --> 01:11:56,770
Don't look at the fur everyone.
Get back to your trees, okay?

1347
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,431
- That's disgusting, man.
- You're wearing fur.

1348
01:11:58,631 --> 01:11:59,462
Declan!

1349
01:11:59,663 --> 01:12:01,124
- That's not real fur.
- Oh, shit!

1350
01:12:03,366 --> 01:12:05,454
Honestly, get out of here.
Take your humans!

1351
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,741
The guy in the bow-tie, he's gonna go first!

1352
01:12:09,103 --> 01:12:10,484
Get out of here!

1353
01:12:10,854 --> 01:12:13,537
Take all your coats off
if you want to keep everyone!

1354
01:12:13,637 --> 01:12:15,479
Take that army service jacket off...

1355
01:12:18,933 --> 01:12:20,685
Get that camera out of my face!

1356
01:12:20,885 --> 01:12:22,887
Go, go! Let's go, let's go. Come on!

1357
01:12:24,589 --> 01:12:25,990
Run, Stu, RUN!

1358
01:12:28,743 --> 01:12:30,275
Let's go, let's go!

1359
01:12:35,561 --> 01:12:37,403
- They're coming, guys!
- Shit!

1360
01:12:37,763 --> 01:12:39,104
I got one!

1361
01:12:57,103 --> 01:12:58,995
My leg! My leg!

1362
01:13:03,991 --> 01:13:05,142
Oh, God!

1363
01:13:05,632 --> 01:13:07,564
Stu! Stu!

1364
01:13:07,765 --> 01:13:08,656
STU!

1365
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:14,161
Stu!

1366
01:13:15,623 --> 01:13:16,984
Get off me!

1367
01:13:18,226 --> 01:13:19,887
Stu, are you alright?!

1368
01:13:20,758 --> 01:13:21,769
Stu!

1369
01:13:23,051 --> 01:13:23,962
Stu!

1370
01:13:25,153 --> 01:13:25,934
Ah, fuck!

1371
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:31,420
Fuck off!

1372
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,141
Get off me!

1373
01:13:35,264 --> 01:13:37,176
You stinky piece of assholes!

1374
01:13:42,491 --> 01:13:44,243
Stupid werewolves!

1375
01:13:44,493 --> 01:13:45,575
Look away Nick!

1376
01:13:45,775 --> 01:13:47,777
Don't look at their blood!

1377
01:13:47,967 --> 01:13:49,629
Stu!

1378
01:13:49,829 --> 01:13:52,522
He's a really good dude!
Leave him alone!

1379
01:13:52,542 --> 01:13:53,373
It's too late for him!

1380
01:13:53,573 --> 01:13:55,765
- Don't look at the blood Nick!
- Stu!

1381
01:14:07,728 --> 01:14:09,540
There he is.

1382
01:14:11,292 --> 01:14:14,335
He's probably still a little upset
having seen his

1383
01:14:14,535 --> 01:14:17,669
best friend disemboweled by werewolves.

1384
01:14:19,801 --> 01:14:20,962
Nick!

1385
01:14:21,673 --> 01:14:22,934
I found you.

1386
01:14:24,496 --> 01:14:25,637
Whoa!

1387
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,082
That was pretty full on, heh?

1388
01:14:36,098 --> 01:14:38,891
But this is what happens
when you are a vampire.

1389
01:14:39,652 --> 01:14:41,894
You have to watch everyone die.

1390
01:14:43,966 --> 01:14:46,219
You're mother and father.

1391
01:14:46,419 --> 01:14:47,640
All your friends.

1392
01:14:47,881 --> 01:14:49,512
Sometimes brutal.

1393
01:14:52,065 --> 01:14:55,368
Like slipping and falling
onto a giant spike.

1394
01:14:55,629 --> 01:14:57,240
Or falling asleep.

1395
01:14:57,511 --> 01:15:00,033
In an autumn pile of leaves,

1396
01:15:00,394 --> 01:15:04,118
and having some of them,
block your wind pipe.

1397
01:15:04,728 --> 01:15:07,301
Or making the simple mistake,

1398
01:15:07,762 --> 01:15:10,404
of fashioning a mask out of crackers,

1399
01:15:10,605 --> 01:15:12,407
and being attacked by ducks.

1400
01:15:12,657 --> 01:15:13,918
Geese.

1401
01:15:14,529 --> 01:15:15,950
Swans.

1402
01:15:16,581 --> 01:15:18,613
Or simply dieing of old age.

1403
01:15:21,206 --> 01:15:23,678
But even old age is brutal.

1404
01:15:24,129 --> 01:15:25,751
Watching your friends...

1405
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:26,982
... grow old.

1406
01:15:27,252 --> 01:15:29,204
They can't piss.

1407
01:15:29,505 --> 01:15:33,088
And they say stupid things and
their brains go and they

1408
01:15:33,289 --> 01:15:35,091
can't remember anything.

1409
01:15:37,213 --> 01:15:40,636
And then, one day, they can't even
remember who you are.

1410
01:15:41,968 --> 01:15:44,110
And you wish they were dead.

1411
01:15:44,601 --> 01:15:46,543
And then they do die.

1412
01:15:50,026 --> 01:15:50,807
No.

1413
01:15:51,007 --> 01:15:53,009
If I know Stu...

1414
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:56,363
... this was probably the way
he wanted to go.

1415
01:15:56,834 --> 01:15:59,396
Disemboweled by werewolves.

1416
01:16:00,267 --> 01:16:01,518
Blood and guts,

1417
01:16:01,719 --> 01:16:03,721
splat onto the trees.

1418
01:16:03,991 --> 01:16:06,444
His face torned to shreds.

1419
01:16:16,174 --> 01:16:18,426
I hope I made you feel better.

1420
01:16:24,853 --> 01:16:27,066
Ah, well, from what we
could see in the beginning

1421
01:16:27,266 --> 01:16:29,508
it looks like there's been
a bit of a dog attack.

1422
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:31,310
That's really what happens,
when you get, you know...

1423
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:32,271
dangerous dogs.

1424
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:34,293
Um, straits, not being looked after.

1425
01:16:34,493 --> 01:16:35,595
This is not good.

1426
01:16:36,395 --> 01:16:37,977
No, not good at all.

1427
01:16:38,618 --> 01:16:41,389
There's nicer ways to go,
then being torn apart,

1428
01:16:41,489 --> 01:16:44,129
by what looks like a pack of dogs,
more than just one.

1429
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:44,928
I say so.

1430
01:16:45,029 --> 01:16:46,656
These attacks have been happening more,
more frequent.

1431
01:16:46,856 --> 01:16:50,190
They're happening on a monthly bases and
and it's just no good for anybody, okay?

1432
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:52,392
Specially not the dogs.
Certainly not the community.

1433
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:54,274
I've got the bastard.

1434
01:16:54,354 --> 01:16:55,716
One of them here, hey?

1435
01:16:55,836 --> 01:16:57,328
That's what I'm talking about.
Look at it.

1436
01:16:57,528 --> 01:16:59,820
End of the day,
this dog is gonna have to be put down.

1437
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:01,332
What a shame.

1438
01:17:02,873 --> 01:17:03,894
Look what you did.

1439
01:17:04,235 --> 01:17:04,976
Hey?

1440
01:17:05,526 --> 01:17:08,279
He's got the scent again, hasn't he?
He wants to go again. He's not finished.

1441
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:08,900
Yeah.

1442
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:41,945
They say that vampires hearts
are cold and dead.

1443
01:17:42,425 --> 01:17:44,517
Definitely dead.

1444
01:17:44,568 --> 01:17:47,751
- Bye Stu.
- He would have loved his scarf.

1445
01:17:47,951 --> 01:17:49,893
It was lovely, loose, knit.

1446
01:17:50,424 --> 01:17:54,098
But I don't know.
I think I still feel things inside it.

1447
01:17:58,112 --> 01:17:59,273
Deacon!

1448
01:18:00,524 --> 01:18:01,666
Deacon!

1449
01:18:01,776 --> 01:18:04,058
Deacon, wakey, wakey. Hey!

1450
01:18:04,258 --> 01:18:07,632
You don't sleep in here.
The curtain's opened. It's nearly morning.

1451
01:18:07,722 --> 01:18:10,145
You want to get sizzled to a crisp.

1452
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:13,148
You know, you could think
a little about these things.

1453
01:18:13,348 --> 01:18:13,538
Okay.

1454
01:18:13,628 --> 01:18:15,620
- Sorry Viago.
- It's okay.

1455
01:18:15,781 --> 01:18:17,723
Night, night! Okay.

1456
01:18:44,010 --> 01:18:47,474
Received at 4:20 AM:

1457
01:19:10,448 --> 01:19:12,080
- Stu?!
- Hey, Deacon.

1458
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,882
- Stu!
- How is it?

1459
01:19:14,693 --> 01:19:15,704
Good to see you.

1460
01:19:15,824 --> 01:19:16,545
Look at his face!

1461
01:19:16,745 --> 01:19:18,307
I saw them tear you to shreds!

1462
01:19:18,507 --> 01:19:19,568
Look! He looks like Seal!

1463
01:19:20,109 --> 01:19:21,000
They didn't kill me.

1464
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:23,272
- It looks cool.
- Thank you, thank you.

1465
01:19:23,382 --> 01:19:24,633
Meet some of our friends.

1466
01:19:25,024 --> 01:19:26,595
Anton, Deacon.

1467
01:19:27,236 --> 01:19:28,788
Hi, Anton.

1468
01:19:32,582 --> 01:19:34,214
I must have blacked out.

1469
01:19:34,414 --> 01:19:35,845
And then, I remember,

1470
01:19:36,045 --> 01:19:37,487
- an ambulance.
- He's going into shock.

1471
01:19:37,687 --> 01:19:39,269
O'Leary. O'Leary!

1472
01:19:39,469 --> 01:19:40,851
Yeah, coming!

1473
01:19:41,051 --> 01:19:43,333
- Okay, calm down, mate.
- Calm down.

1474
01:19:46,797 --> 01:19:47,858
Looks like rabies, doesn't it?

1475
01:19:48,058 --> 01:19:50,901
And I don't know how long after that was,
but like, woke up.

1476
01:19:51,342 --> 01:19:53,954
And it was daytime.

1477
01:19:57,688 --> 01:19:59,590
And I couldn't find my clothes.

1478
01:20:01,853 --> 01:20:03,785
Those werewolves guys...

1479
01:20:03,955 --> 01:20:05,086
... eventually found me.

1480
01:20:05,657 --> 01:20:06,878
And they had some,

1481
01:20:07,078 --> 01:20:09,080
they like, lent me some pants.

1482
01:20:10,152 --> 01:20:12,154
So, yeah, those guys
have been supporting me.

1483
01:20:12,404 --> 01:20:14,156
Cause I was quite confused.

1484
01:20:16,048 --> 01:20:17,890
Yeah, these are the guys who, um,

1485
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:19,572
turned me into a werewolf.

1486
01:20:20,012 --> 01:20:21,464
You knit your own jersey?

1487
01:20:22,054 --> 01:20:23,366
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah?

1488
01:20:23,556 --> 01:20:25,418
- I knit.
- Is that the moon, or?

1489
01:20:25,678 --> 01:20:28,041
- Yes.
- Hopefully, we won't, you know...

1490
01:20:31,194 --> 01:20:32,435
Ah, this is a nice place.

1491
01:20:32,635 --> 01:20:35,428
Please, don't, ah, don't lick anything or...

1492
01:20:35,629 --> 01:20:37,230
... pee on anything.

1493
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:39,092
We were worried at first,
you know, we thought

1494
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:41,705
'Ooh, they are just going to
urinate on everything.'

1495
01:20:41,935 --> 01:20:45,189
But they actually are really polite
and pretty clean.

1496
01:20:45,319 --> 01:20:47,741
There was obviously that werewolves smell,

1497
01:20:47,942 --> 01:20:51,305
which permeated the entire house
for the first half an hour.

1498
01:20:51,505 --> 01:20:54,098
But we opened some windows and
got rid of that.

1499
01:20:54,298 --> 01:20:56,591
'What a stupid suggestion,
their idea,' I thought.

1500
01:20:56,611 --> 01:20:57,211
No way.

1501
01:20:57,412 --> 01:21:00,104
You know, walking into the vampire's den.
That's ludicrous.

1502
01:21:00,305 --> 01:21:01,376
That's my hand.

1503
01:21:01,446 --> 01:21:03,128
But I thought, we'll give it a shot.

1504
01:21:03,328 --> 01:21:05,500
You know, I'm the alpha male,
so I made the call.

1505
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:06,822
I'm the alpha male.

1506
01:21:07,022 --> 01:21:09,324
- Yes.
- So, generally...

1507
01:21:09,374 --> 01:21:10,616
... all of the other guys follow me.

1508
01:21:10,816 --> 01:21:11,757
- For Stu!
- For STU!

1509
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:12,798
Thanks guys.

1510
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:14,600
What have you done to your face?

1511
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,992
I got attacked by some werewolves.

1512
01:21:17,052 --> 01:21:20,436
Army is a werewolf.
Seemed like a very nice person.

1513
01:21:20,836 --> 01:21:22,718
So, Katherine is a vampire now.

1514
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:24,781
- Yes.
- We decide to get together.

1515
01:21:24,981 --> 01:21:26,763
We just thought, the hell with it, you know.

1516
01:21:26,963 --> 01:21:28,234
What have we got to lose?

1517
01:21:28,635 --> 01:21:31,067
I was just sitting, doing nothing,

1518
01:21:31,267 --> 01:21:34,140
and he came floating in and over to me,

1519
01:21:34,341 --> 01:21:37,034
and I recognized him.
It was wonderful.

1520
01:21:37,234 --> 01:21:39,036
And then I bit you on the neck.

1521
01:21:39,746 --> 01:21:41,298
That's right.

1522
01:21:42,369 --> 01:21:44,481
And I don't mind being a vampire.

1523
01:21:44,682 --> 01:21:46,484
I'm enjoying it.

1524
01:21:47,765 --> 01:21:50,227
Some people freak out a bit
about the age difference.

1525
01:21:50,428 --> 01:21:54,172
Uh, they think, 'what's this 96-year old
lady doing with a guy,

1526
01:21:54,372 --> 01:21:55,944
for times her age.'

1527
01:21:56,084 --> 01:21:59,077
- And, you know, I don't care...
- It doesn't make any difference.

1528
01:21:59,277 --> 01:22:01,569
No, they can call me cradle-snatcher,
who cares.

1529
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,723
I decided to bite her and
we're gonna be together forever.

1530
01:22:04,903 --> 01:22:06,345
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

1531
01:22:22,201 --> 01:22:25,925
Pauline and I are tentatively back together.

1532
01:22:26,145 --> 01:22:29,589
But it's not long before
you remember why it was we

1533
01:22:29,789 --> 01:22:31,591
broke up in the first place.

1534
01:22:36,186 --> 01:22:37,177
We start in our bedroom,

1535
01:22:37,377 --> 01:22:40,401
and I need that totally boarded up or
blacked out somehow.

1536
01:22:40,601 --> 01:22:41,842
My husband is my familiar.

1537
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:44,915
So, there has been a dynamic shift there.

1538
01:22:44,935 --> 01:22:48,089
You could buy a Bedazzler.
So you write that down. That's B-E-D...

1539
01:22:48,289 --> 01:22:50,892
I feel like I'm where I need to be now.

1540
01:22:51,432 --> 01:22:53,354
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1541
01:22:53,414 --> 01:22:54,275
Great.

1542
01:22:55,326 --> 01:22:56,758
But I am your Master.

1543
01:22:56,878 --> 01:22:58,630
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1544
01:22:59,501 --> 01:23:01,753
Yeah, these guys have to laugh
at my jokes, right guys?

1545
01:23:01,913 --> 01:23:03,385
Yeah!

1546
01:23:04,016 --> 01:23:04,816
That is a good one.

1547
01:23:05,017 --> 01:23:06,959
I always look round to
make sure they're all laughing.

1548
01:23:07,159 --> 01:23:09,521
Like, if I see one of them is not
quite laughing I'll be like, 'Hey!'

1549
01:23:09,722 --> 01:23:11,664
'You laughing?',
and often I'll test you.

1550
01:23:11,864 --> 01:23:12,935
What are you laughing at, Justin?

1551
01:23:13,135 --> 01:23:14,887
- Hey?
- What are you laughing at now?

1552
01:23:15,087 --> 01:23:16,839
- Just then?
- Yeah, yeah, but what?

1553
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:17,930
Oh, I don't know.

1554
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,054
Ah, test failed! Test failed!

1555
01:23:21,254 --> 01:23:23,676
You're laughing now.
What are you laughing at now though?

1556
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:25,894
I don't know cause...

1557
01:23:26,094 --> 01:23:28,031
Ah, another failure!

1558
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:29,743
Well, what are you laughing at Stu?

1559
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:31,495
Oh, I was laughing with the group.

1560
01:23:31,575 --> 01:23:33,277
Yep, that's good. That's good, yeah.

1561
01:23:34,658 --> 01:23:36,900
Just pay attention. Pay attention.

1562
01:23:37,831 --> 01:23:38,882
Laugh with the group.

1563
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:17,907
You will not remember
the last hour and a half,

1564
01:25:18,107 --> 01:25:19,909
of what you have just seen.

1565
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:22,102
You will forget...

1566
01:25:22,632 --> 01:25:24,885
... the contents of this movie.

1567
