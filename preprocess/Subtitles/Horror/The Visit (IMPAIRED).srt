He's as strong as a wrestler!

473
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:42,245
BECCA: He's old.
They get confused.

474
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,332
Don't freak out.
Old people get paranoid.

475
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:48,585
And he's a country guy.
All he does is chop wood.

476
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:57,260
TYLER: <i>Hey, you still
don't want to talk about it?</i>

477

(CREAKING SOUND)

478
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,387
What is that?

479
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:44,474
Okay, we think there's
someone outside the door.

480
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,142
It's 10:47.

481
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:49,104
Open the door, Becca.

482
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:52,524
No way.

483
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:55,235
TYLER: Okay,
keep recording this.

484
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,954
Come on,
let's see what's out there.

485
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,081
(CREAKING CONTINUES)

486
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:10,834
BECCA: No, something's wrong.

487
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,294
I'm opening the door, Becca.

488
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,589
I'm opening
the door now, Becca.

489
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,675
I don't think you should.

490
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,304
Here I go.
I'm gonna open the door.

491
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,890
Open it, then!
Why do you keep talking about it?

492
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,402
Close the door,
close the door!

493
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:39,362
Ugh!

494
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:44,075
Jesus, Becca, I'm blind!

495
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:49,914
Pop Pop?

496
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:54,335
Pop Pop?

497
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:59,757
I gotta tell you the truth.
She has a diagnosed disorder.

498
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:02,177
Apparently, many
elderly people have it.

499
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:05,722
Why was she
throwing up like that?

500
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:11,311
Well, sometimes she gets it in
her head that she ate something,

501
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,813
and it's inside her.

502
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:15,482
(SIGHS)

503
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,942
And trying to crawl out.

504
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:21,404
It's called Sundowning.
It's a kind of dementia.

505
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:23,615
It's triggered by nightfall.

506
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,200
BECCA: This is real?

507
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:29,537
It's like somebody talking in their
sleep is how I was explained it.

508
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,421
It's probably best that
we just call it a rule

509
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:34,626
that you two shouldn't come
out of your room after 9:30 p.m.

510
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:36,377
Deal?

511
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:38,838
Is that a deal?

512
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:40,673
Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

513
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,218
I'm sorry about this.

514
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:45,261
You must not be
happy now.

515
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:49,766
It's okay, Pop Pop.
I'm okay. We're just here till Saturday.

516
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:52,769
Are you going somewhere?

517
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:56,022
Yeah, I've got to catch the
train to go to the costume party.

518
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:57,440
(CLEARS THROAT)

519
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:04,030
Pop Pop, I think you're
mixing up something.

520
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,281
Huh?

521
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:10,995
Oh, man.

522
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,997
Oh, man. What a...

523
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:15,625
What a bunch of
confused old fools

524
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,293
your grandparents
turned out to be.

525
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,379
That's all right.
It's okay.

526
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:20,505
(SIGHS)

527
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:22,173
Don't worry about it.
Yeah.

528
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:24,467
Okay?
(SNIFFS) Okay. Yeah.

529
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:25,552
It's okay.
Right. Yeah.

530
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,303
NANA: <i>Good morning,
Cecil B. DeMille.</i>

531
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,974
He was a great director.

532
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:33,268
I made you
cheddar biscuits, dear.

533
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:39,274
Was the old coot getting ready for
the costume party again?

534
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,401
BECCA: Yeah, he was.

535
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:43,736
He's crazy.

536
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,448
I'm just doing some chores in the barn.
I'll be in in a minute.

537
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:52,328
Something happened
to your computer.

538
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,291
I spilled some
biscuit batter on it.

539
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:58,751
I tried to clean it
with cleaner.

540
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:00,587
I'm sorry.

541
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,008
TYLER: <i>She's weird
during the day,</i>

542
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,759
and then gets even
weirder at night?

543
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,720
I'm telling you it's okay.

544
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:10,888
I downloaded the definition
of "Sundowning."

545
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,265
You wouldn't
understand half the words

546
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,267
I'm reading.
The word "YOLO" isn't in it.

547
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,269
It's got to do with
neurological reactions

548
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:17,937
to sunshine and moonlight.

549
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:20,523
It's literally
a chemical reaction.

550
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:24,068
"Sundown Syndrome: a term
for disorientation, agitation,

"classically described

553
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:32,118
It's normal
old-age problems.

554
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:34,078
People are scared
of old people for no reason.

555
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:35,622
What about the computer?

556
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,707
The only thing messed up
is the computer camera.

557
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,292
There's something else
going on.

558
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,127
She used oven cleaner,

559
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,672
and now the tiny camera
on the screen doesn't see anything.

560
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,799
You don't find
that odd at all?

561
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:48,217
She made a mistake.

562
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:51,721
Just come to accept they're old people
and things won't be as weird.

I can clean it off.

<i>Tyler, why are you quiet?</i>

570
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,701
Nana and Pop Pop
are acting strange. Ow!

<i>What kind of strange?
Becca, did you hit Tyler?</i>

No.

<i>Kids?</i>

574
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:26,255
Pop Pop wears diapers
and he keeps them in an outhouse,

575
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:27,840
and Nana walks around
at night without her clothes,

576
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:30,927
and Pop Pop thinks
strangers are following him.

<i>Becca, how strange
are they acting?</i>

582
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,526
They haven't been
mean one second.

583
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:47,985
Nana crawled after us
under the house.

584
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,195
Playing hide-and-seek.

00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:21,532
Right now,
I want to talk about something else.

630
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,826
I know it happened
a long time ago,

631
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,579
but what happened
on the day Mom left?

632
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,999
She won't tell me.

633
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:35,546
Did she do something?

634
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:39,383
Nana? Nana?

635
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:42,386
(WHIMPERING)

636
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:44,972
Nana, don't answer
that question.

637
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,767
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

638
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:54,649
No more questions
about Loretta Jamison.

639
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:57,151
Maybe I can ask about...

640
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,445
I don't wanna
star in your movie.

641
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:04,408
Okay. It's Wednesday night.
Three nights left.

642
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:09,872
T-Diamond Stylus is gonna find out
what exactly is going on.

643
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:11,707
What are you doing?

644
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:14,377
I'm putting the camera
out tonight. Okay?

645
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,087
It's like we're living
with a werewolf.

646
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,421
You can't record her.

647
00:38:17,505 --> 00:38:18,589
Swerve.

648
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:19,882
Look, I know you
won't understand this

649
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,509
because your brain
isn't fully developed yet,

650
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:23,219
but you can't do this.

651
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,720
Why?

652
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,515
It's exploitative.
I have cinematic standards.

653
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:31,060
(LAUGHING) No. No one gives a crap about
cinematic standards, okay?

654
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,853
It's not the 1800s.

655
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:34,855
Have you seen reality TV?

656
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:38,067
<i>Housekeepers of Houston</i>
has, like, a billion viewers.

657
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,986
If one of us isn't
participating in the event,

658
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:41,278
we can't record it.

659
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:42,738
It's just what's ethical.

660
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:44,532
No offense to Ryan
Seacrest or whoever

661
00:38:44,615 --> 00:38:45,825
came up with
the <i>Housekeepers of Houston.</i>

662
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:49,078
You think you're
so great, don't you?

663
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:59,171
I hope things
don't get weirder.

664
00:39:00,464 --> 00:39:02,299
'Cause I'm at my limit.

665
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,684
TYLER: Show the clock.
Show the clock.

666
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:16,897
This is what Pop Pop
was talking about.

667
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:19,859
The werewolf is real.

668
00:39:19,942 --> 00:39:21,193
BECCA: Wait!

669
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:24,280
She's Sundowning.

670
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:28,868
We're participating in this.
You're not being <i>Housekeepers of Houston.</i>

671
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:34,957
Wait. If you're gonna open the door,
just open it for a little bit.

672
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:56,312
(CREAKING)

673
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:12,912
(GROWLS)
(BECCA GASPS)

674
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,099
She's supposed to do that?

675
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:35,643
BECCA: It's just like
someone talking in their sleep.

676
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:37,895
You used to talk in your sleep
till you were seven.

677
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,856
Dad used to come in
and quiet you down.

678
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,174
Hey, Becca.

679
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,219
Who am I?

680
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:19,728
BECCA: T. T.

681
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,988
There's a family of foxes.
You're going to miss it.

682
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,739
We're coming!
BECCA: We're coming!

683
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:36,036
BECCA: Just stop.

684
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,963
TYLER: Why is Nana
staring into the well?

685
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:49,049
Come on, let's go.
Come on, enough of that.

686
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:50,634
BECCA: I don't know.
POP POP: Come on.

687
00:41:59,101 --> 00:42:01,187
<i>Mise-en-scène.</i>

688
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,773
BECCA: You know,
you're not as dumb as your performance

689
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:06,192
on standardized tests
would indicate.

690
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:07,735
Oh. Oh!

691
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:10,446
I forgot I had
something for you.

692
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:21,332
When you think of Dad now,
in California, do you still like him?

693
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,002
I don't know.
Stuff happens.

694
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:27,713
No, but Dad is hilarious.
Dad's funny.

695
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:31,091
He sent the funny card
of the fat lady on the boardwalk. (LAUGHS)

696
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:32,927
Do you remember that?

697
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,137
What do you mean
"stuff happens"?

698
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,183
People leave.

699
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:43,646
Because they find something
they like better.

700
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:45,898
So you don't feel bad?

701
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:48,442
No.

702
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,321
You're not being truthful.

703
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:56,992
Well, you can believe what you want,
but this is how I feel.

704
00:42:58,118 --> 00:42:59,912
Make me believe you.

705
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:09,463
So, I'm on the Titans pee wee
football team and it was third down.

706
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:12,299
It was at the end
and we were leading.

707
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:14,343
So if we stop them,
we probably win the game.

708
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,137
Give me context.
How old are you?

709
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:18,973
I'm eight.

710
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:22,643
So, I'm free safety.

711
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,937
Which means that
I'm supposed to tackle the guy

712
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,274
if he makes it past
the people on the line.

713
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:29,942
So, their running
back punches the hole... Okay.

714
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:32,069
Am I supposed to be
following these terms?

715
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:34,405
Are these phrases supposed
to mean something to me?

716
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,948
Just listen.

717
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:40,869
So their running back,
who's big, makes it past the line,

718
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:43,622
and I'm the only one
left to tackle him.

719
00:43:43,706 --> 00:43:44,748
All I got to do
is tackle him,

720
00:43:44,832 --> 00:43:47,251
put my hands around him
and tackle him, but...

721
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:51,547
I just stand there.

722
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:56,302
They call it "freezing"
and I could hear everyone yelling.

723
00:43:56,385 --> 00:44:00,347
Coach Daugherty, Dad.
All my teammates, and...

724
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:03,517
He gets the first down
and runs and runs,

725
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,563
and the other team is celebrating,
and I'm still standing there.

726
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,735
Same place.

727
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:18,282
Then the assistant coach
came and got me,

728
00:44:18,365 --> 00:44:20,492
and Dad patted me on the shoulder
and then went to the car,

729
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:24,246
and he never told me
he was angry or anything.

730
00:44:26,582 --> 00:44:28,709
You think Dad didn't
say anything and left

731
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:31,587
because you didn't tackle another
eight-year-old in a game

732
00:44:31,754 --> 00:44:33,380
five years ago?

733
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:40,763
When you say it like that,
it sounds stupid.

734
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:44,266
(CLANKING)

735
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:48,354
BECCA: Why are we here?

736
00:44:48,437 --> 00:44:50,272
TYLER: She was
staring at something.

737
00:44:59,448 --> 00:45:01,950
So, what did you find?

738
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:05,412
It's only water.

739
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:13,253
So, I just
read these in order?

740
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,550
"If you could be any animal,
what would it be?"

741
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:21,136
I feel like a douche, Becca.
Shut up.

742
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,389
I would be a dolphin.

743
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:25,516
It's an intuitive and highly
intelligent creature

744
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,477
with great power
and poetry in its movements.

745
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:30,911
How come you like
the pizza delivery guy,

746
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:34,149
even though he has
all that ratchet acne?

747
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,030
Please answer the question.

748
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:46,328
He's kind.

749
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:49,331
He has kind eyes.

750
00:45:52,835 --> 00:45:56,296
How come you don't look
at yourself in the mirror?

751
00:45:56,839 --> 00:46:00,259
Okay, fine.
What's this now?

752
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:03,804
Besides when you're editing,
you don't like looking at yourself.

753
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,180
You never look at
yourself in the mirror.

754
00:46:05,264 --> 00:46:07,975
You comb your hair
with your back to the mirror.

755
00:46:08,058 --> 00:46:10,477
And I see you
brush your teeth.

756
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:12,938
You look down
the whole time.

757
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,570
Your sweater's inside out.
Did you know that?

758
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:23,574
Did you see that in
the mirror this morning?

759
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:26,535
Is that correct?

760
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,209
It doesn't feel
so good, does it?

761
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:39,715
Are you changing
the focal length of the lens?

762
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,717
No, I don't even
know what that is.

763
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:43,677
Are you zooming?

764
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:45,762
No.

765
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:52,769
So do you admit that
you don't look at yourself,

766
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:55,314
or are you gonna
keep lying?

767
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:57,900
When do you think
I started doing that?

768
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:00,152
You know when.

769
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:05,282
That's not true, asshole.

770
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:07,743
You think you're worthless.

771
00:47:08,202 --> 00:47:09,578
Admit it.

772
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:15,501
(SOBBING)

773
00:47:18,462 --> 00:47:20,923
He gave me
a card when he left.

774
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:25,594
A card.

775
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:33,602
Old footage of us as kids.

776
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:37,314
I was thinking of
using it in the doc.

777
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:41,735
I refuse to use anything
that has my dad in it.

778
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:45,155
That would mean
I forgive him.

779
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:55,457
TYLER: Nana?

780
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:01,296
Nana?

781
00:48:07,636 --> 00:48:09,179
Becca's blind.

782
00:48:11,265 --> 00:48:13,433
I know I'm right.

783
00:48:13,517 --> 00:48:15,894
That there is
something going on here.

784
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:22,442
Maybe there's something
down in the basement.

785
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:26,280
They don't want us to go down there.
They're throwing shade.

something down there.

That's why they don't want us to go down.

Saturday but they never showed.

hadn't been feeling herself,

I'd just stop by and check in on them.
