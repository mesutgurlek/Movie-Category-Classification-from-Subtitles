[Announcer]

00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,973
the one you take to bed
with you.

5
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:51,951
Max, it's that time again:

6
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:57,047
Time to slowly, painfully
ease yourself back into consciousness.

7
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,752
No, I'm not a dream,

8
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:02,125
although I've been told
I'm a vision of loveliness.

- [Chuckles]
- [Man Chuckles] Who told you that?

10
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,996
I'm nothing less than your
faithful girl Friday, Bridey James,

11
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:12,597
here with your wake-up call of today,
which is Wednesday the 23rd.

12
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:14,607
You got that?

13
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,872
Wednesday the 23rd.

14
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,947
And I have a message.

15
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,711
Remember your meeting
this morning at 6:30...

16
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:27,083
with Shinji Kuraki
of Hiroshima Video.

17
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:30,214
This meeting is to take place
at the Classic Hotel,

18
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,486
suite 17.

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,326
And needless to say,
it's your first of the day.

20
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:39,366
Don't you know anyone
who works 9:00 to 5:00?

21
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,664
Over and out, Commander.

You know I love ya.

30
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:15,991

- Will you open the door?
For fuck's sake, open the door!

- [Baby Crying]
- I want you out of this place!

You just gotta open
the fucking door!

00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,468
Well, I looked over
the stills.

36
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,479
I am interested
a little bit.

37
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,538
- How many shows you got?
- Thirteen,

38
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,847
with a possibility of
another six if the sales go well.

39

- You got cassettes?
- Of course.

[Both Laughing]

41
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,890
No, hold it.
Uh, show me the last one.

42
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,162
- [Speaking Japanese]
- Number 13.

43
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,933
But you won't understand anything.
Everything is set up in the first two.

44
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:03,464
My audience ain't gonna see the first
two shows. Show me the last one.

45
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,438
What do ya think?

46
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:11,944
Can we get away with it?
Do we wanna get away with it?

47
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,571
I think Oriental sex
is a natural.

48
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,708
I think it'll get us an audience
we've never had before.

49
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,845
I don't like it.
Not tacky enough.

50
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:26,085
- Not tacky enough for what?
- Tacky enough to turn me on.

51
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,218
Too much class
is bad for sex.

52
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:31,491
Maybe.

53
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:34,124
I don't know.
[Exhales]

It's soft.

55
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,500
Something too...

56
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,664
soft about it.

57
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,111
I'm lookin' for something
that'll break through, ya know?

Oh. Okay.

[Clicking Switches]

64
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,298
Now, it'll
come through on that.

65
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:53,107
Now, we only got about 53 seconds,
so keep your eyes open.

66
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:57,980
They've got an unscrambler scrambler,
if you know what I mean.

67
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,985
It sensed that we
were unscrambling...

68
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:03,921
and, uh, automatically
changed its code on us.

69
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,924
What satellite
is it coming from?

70
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,222
- Snooker, I think.
- Country of origin?

71
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:13,857
Uh, let me see. Uh... Assuming 53
seconds represents the period of delay,

72
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,458
I'd say somewhere, uh,

73
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,561
in Malaysia?

74
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,439
- [Hums]
- Okay, here we go.

75
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,443

What is that wall behind her?
What is that, clay?

79
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,460
- Yeah. White clay.
- [Sobbing, Moaning]

80
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,465
I think it's electrified.

- That's it?

86
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,595
That's it.

87
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,359
- [Sighs]
- Grotesque, as promised.

88
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,799
Okay. Can you hang a search
on it next time it...

89
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,803
Already workin' on it.

90
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:28,602
I was pretty insulted when it just
shrugged us off in less than a minute.

91
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,008
Well, patron, interested?

92
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,711
Yeah. Harlan, can you do something
about these labels?

93
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:41,413
I mean, uh, this is supposed
to be a clandestine operation,
you know what I mean?

94
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,455
Si, patron.

95
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,225
I always find myself
getting nervous,

96
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,997
even if you've been doing it
all your life, don't you think?

97
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,005
[Woman]
Oh, yeah. Oh, for sure.

98
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:03,304
- 'Course, that's part
of the excitement of it.
- Mm-hmm.

99
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,670
Want a smoke?

100
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,683
- No, thanks.
- [Max] Mmm.

101
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,751
- Max, just relax.
- Okay.

102
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:22,090
[Announcer] And now here it is:
The Rena King Show.

103
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,823
And this afternoon,
Rena's guests are Max Renn,

104
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:29,891
controversial president of Channel 83,
radio personality Nicki Brand...

105
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,199
and media prophet
Professor Brian O'Blivion.

106
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,671
Take it away, Rena.

107
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,039
- [Max Exhales]
- Max Renn,

108
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,635
your television station
offers its viewers...

109
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,146
everything
from soft-core pornography...

110
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,149
to hard-core violence.

111
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:47,311
- Why?
- Well, it's a matter
of economics, Rena.

112
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,913
We're, uh, small. In order to survive,
we have to give people...

113
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,924
something they can't
get anywhere else,

114
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,324
and, uh...
and we do that.

115
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,124
But don't you feel
such shows contribute...

116
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:01,963
to a social climate of violence
and sexual malaise?

117
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:05,401
- And do you care?
- Certainly, I care. [Chuckles]

118
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,269
I care enough, in fact,
to give my viewers a...

119
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,902
a harmless outlet for their fantasies
and their frustrations.

120
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:16,210
As far as I'm concerned,
that's a socially positive act.

121
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,012
What about it, Nicki?
Is it socially positive?

122
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:22,248
Well, I think we live
in overstimulated times.

123
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,653
We crave stimulation
for its own sake.

124
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,658
We gorge ourselves on it.

125
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,388
We always want more,
whether it's tactile,

126
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,330
emotional or sexual,
and I think that's bad.

127
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,391
Then why did you
wear that dress?

128
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,030
- Sorry?
- That dress.

129
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:44,304
[Chuckles] It's very stimulating,
and... and it's red.

130
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,540
You know what Freud would
have said about that dress.

131
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:51,777
And he would've been right.
I admit it.

132
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,684
I live in a highly excited
state of overstimulation.

133
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,715
Listen, I'd really like
to take you out to dinner tonight.

134
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:03,295
- You're beautiful in that dress.
What do you think?
- Professor O'Blivion,

135
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,588
do you think erotic TV shows
and violent TV shows...

136
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:09,998
lead to desensitization,
to dehumanization?

137
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:12,002
[Max Murmuring]

138
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:16,666
The television screen has become
the retina of the mind's eye.

139
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:18,902
[Murmuring
Continues]

140
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:22,572
- Yes.
- That's why I refuse
to appear on television,

141
00:11:22,647 --> 00:11:25,081
except on television.

142
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,244
Of course, O'Blivion is not
the name I was born with.

143
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,447
That's my television name.

144
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:34,014
Soon all of us will have
special names,

145
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:38,529
names designed to cause
the cathode ray tube to resonate.

146
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,860
- [Max] Yes, I am, actually.
- Yes.

147
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:45,960
- I am very interested.
- Nicki, is Max Renn
a menace to society?

148
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:48,437
I'm not sure.

149
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:51,100
He's certainly
a menace to me.

150
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:56,109
- [Screaming]
- [Static]

151
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:59,116
[Max] When does the plot, uh,
start to unravel here?

152
00:11:59,184 --> 00:12:03,143
I mean, who is this black guy?
Is he a political prisoner?

153
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,587
- There's no plot.
- [Man Moaning]

154
00:12:05,657 --> 00:12:07,955
It just goes on
like that for an hour.

155
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:10,586
- Goes on like what?
- Like that.

156
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:14,257

it's dangerous, Max.

314
00:24:59,262 --> 00:25:02,698
- Videodrome.
- Why? It's Mafia? They do business.

No, no. It's more, um...
How can I say?

More political
than that.

Come on, Masha.

Videodrome.

It's... snuff TV.

It's easier and safer to fake it.

326
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:39,559
Because it has something...

I did a panel show
with Prof. O'Blivion.
The Rena King Show.

Oh, yes. You said some
very superficial things.

Violence, sex,

- What do you want?

I wanna talk
with your father...

376
00:29:20,456 --> 00:29:23,721
about a new twist in video
that he may not be aware of.

377

I love the view.

You look like them,
like one of Father's derelicts.

[Chuckles] Think it's a style
that's coming back.

380
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,126
In their case, Mr. Renn,
it's not a style.

381
00:29:58,193 --> 00:30:01,924
It's a disease forced on them by their
lack of access to the cathode ray tube.

382
00:30:01,997 --> 00:30:04,864
You think a few doses of TV
are gonna help them?

383
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:09,302
Watching TV will help patch them back
into the world's mixing board.

384
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:11,464
Absolutely.

385
00:30:13,842 --> 00:30:17,972
And I guess you encourage Father's
derelicts to make home movies?

The world's mixing board?

- I am my father's screen.

Once you've told me what this
visit is all about, he may
choose to send you a cassette.

00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:42,434
If he does, which format
would you like?

391
00:30:42,504 --> 00:30:45,200
If he does, it's gonna make
conversation a little difficult.

392
00:30:45,274 --> 00:30:49,768
My father has not engaged
in conversation for at least 20 years.

393
00:30:49,845 --> 00:30:53,508

The battle for the mind
of North America...

444
00:35:14,142 --> 00:35:16,940
will be fought
in the video arena:

445

The Videodrome.

446
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:24,075
The television screen
is the retina of the mind's eye.

447
00:35:24,152 --> 00:35:28,680
Therefore, the television screen is part
of the physical structure of the brain.

448
00:35:28,756 --> 00:35:33,284
Therefore, whatever appears
on the television screen...

449

emerges as raw experience
for those who watch it.

Therefore,
television is reality,

than television.

I had a brain tumor,

459
00:36:14,002 --> 00:36:17,165
and I had visions.

460
00:36:17,238 --> 00:36:20,799
I believed the visions
caused the tumor...

461
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:23,309
and not the reverse.

462
00:36:23,378 --> 00:36:28,839
I could feel the visions
coalesce and become flesh.

463
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:32,875

I made some tapes.

00:40:07,802 --> 00:40:09,770
This is part of my own
Videodrome collection.

But that tape is just your father
sitting at his desk.

514
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,339
The tone of the hallucinations
is determined by the tone
of the tape's imagery.

515
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:21,848
But the Videodrome signal,
the one that does the damage,

00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:25,750
it can be delivered
under a test pattern, anything.

The signal induces
a brain tumor in the viewer.

It's the tumor that creates
the hallucinations.

to create Videodrome.

in the evolution of man
as a technological animal.

When he realized what his partners
were going to use it for,

away from them.

And they killed him.
Quietly.

that public life on television...

private life in the flesh.

I'd like to find out why,

625
00:50:16,874 --> 00:50:19,502
and I think an analysis
of one of your hallucinations...

626
00:50:19,576 --> 00:50:22,204
would be the right
place to start.

627
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:27,241
Will it hurt?

628
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:29,615
It won't hurt you.

629
00:50:29,686 --> 00:50:31,847
You might catch yourself
sliding in and out...

630
00:50:31,922 --> 00:50:34,049
of a hallucinatory state
after this is all over.

631
00:50:34,124 --> 00:50:38,060
If you do, just relax and enjoy it.
It'll soon go away.

632
00:50:38,128 --> 00:50:41,757
But for now, I think that you'll
find a little S-and-M...

633
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:46,326
will be necessary to trigger off a good,
healthy series of hallucinations.

634
00:50:46,403 --> 00:50:49,167
- [Beeping]
- That's why our Videodrome show
is so strange.

635
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:54,541
Something to do with the effects
of exposure to violence
on the nervous system.

636
00:50:54,611 --> 00:50:56,875
It opens up receptors
in the brain and the spine,

637
00:50:56,947 --> 00:50:59,381
and that allows the Videodrome
signal to sink in.

638
00:50:59,449 --> 00:51:01,917
- You mean I'm gonna have
to hurt you, Barry?
- [Chuckling]

639
00:51:01,985 --> 00:51:05,216
'Fraid not. You don't have
to actually hurt anybody.

640
00:51:05,289 --> 00:51:07,519
You just have to think
about it.

641
00:51:07,591 --> 00:51:10,389
[Humming]

642
00:51:13,897 --> 00:51:16,161
[Humming Loudly]

643
00:51:16,233 --> 00:51:18,258
Wha-a-a... That's too bright!
I can't take it!

644
00:51:18,335 --> 00:51:20,826
- Yes! I forgot! Sorry!
How's that?
- Shit.

645
00:51:20,904 --> 00:51:24,101
- [Humming]
- [Max] Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, that's fine.

646
00:51:30,113 --> 00:51:32,843
Okay, we're rolling.

647
00:51:32,916 --> 00:51:35,214
The taping mechanism
is all self-contained.

648
00:51:35,285 --> 00:51:38,550
You don't have to do
anything now but hallucinate.

649
00:51:38,622 --> 00:51:40,556
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

650
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:46,588
I'll come back for you
later.

651
00:51:49,466 --> 00:51:53,596
You'll forgive me if I don't
stay around to watch.

652
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:56,605
I just can't cope
with the freaky stuff.

653
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:47,279
[Max]
Nicki?

654
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:54,723
- Nicki.
- Well, here we are at last,

655
00:52:54,798 --> 00:52:57,824
right where we oughta be:

656
00:52:57,901 --> 00:53:00,028
On Videodrome.

657
00:53:13,517 --> 00:53:15,951
What are you
waiting for, lover?

658
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:18,351
Let's perform.

659
00:53:18,422 --> 00:53:21,357
Let's open
those neural floodgates.

660
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:32,830
[Breathing Heavily,
Moaning]

661
00:53:40,977 --> 00:53:42,911
[Nicki Gasps]

662
00:53:46,683 --> 00:53:48,617
Aah!

663
00:53:51,755 --> 00:53:53,689
Aah!

664
00:53:56,827 --> 00:53:58,852
[Shouts]

665
00:54:02,899 --> 00:54:07,393
[Moaning]

666
00:54:07,471 --> 00:54:09,837
Aah!

667
00:54:09,906 --> 00:54:12,670
[Gasping]

668
00:54:12,743 --> 00:54:15,143
Aah!

669
00:54:15,212 --> 00:54:17,146
[Gasping]

670
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:23,111
- Aah!
- [Panting]

671
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:38,526
What's going on, Prof. Oblivion?
[Chuckles]

672
00:54:38,602 --> 00:54:40,627
I mean, really.

673
00:54:40,704 --> 00:54:43,002
Oh.

674
00:54:57,721 --> 00:55:00,554
[Gasps]

675
00:55:12,369 --> 00:55:14,599
Oh, Masha.

676
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,371
[Exhales]

677
00:55:48,438 --> 00:55:50,406
Harlan,

678
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,407
it's Max.

679
00:55:52,475 --> 00:55:55,501
Can you come over to
my apartment? Right away.

680
00:55:55,579 --> 00:55:57,547
Yeah, I'm serious.

681
00:55:57,614 --> 00:55:59,673
Come on in.

682
00:55:59,749 --> 00:56:01,910
Well, here I am, patron.

683
00:56:01,985 --> 00:56:05,443
Camera. Flashgun. What's up?
Ya wanna be a centerfold?

684
00:56:05,522 --> 00:56:07,456
I want you to go
into my bedroom,

685
00:56:07,524 --> 00:56:09,719
and I want you to take a look
at what's in my bed.

686
00:56:09,793 --> 00:56:12,318
Uncover it. Don't be shy.
I want pictures.

687
00:56:15,365 --> 00:56:18,357
- Pictures of what's in your bed?
- Yeah. Do it.

688
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,468
Sure. Okay.

689
00:56:25,141 --> 00:56:27,075
Oh, God.

690
00:56:41,157 --> 00:56:43,523
[Exhales]

691
00:56:43,593 --> 00:56:46,289
Well?

692
00:56:48,331 --> 00:56:50,265
Max.

693
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:55,904
I don't see anything.

694
00:56:57,374 --> 00:56:59,442
You didn't just want me to shoot
your bed, pillows, sheets,

695
00:56:59,442 --> 00:57:00,602
You didn't just want me to shoot
your bed, pillows, sheets,

696
00:57:00,676 --> 00:57:03,167
did you?

697
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:16,286
- It's disa...
- Max, are you in some kind
of drug warp?

698
00:57:16,358 --> 00:57:18,349
I've got friends
who can help.

699
00:57:18,427 --> 00:57:20,793
Bridey said she came by
a couple of days ago. You were...

700
00:57:20,863 --> 00:57:23,093
Did you tape Videodrome
last night?

701
00:57:23,165 --> 00:57:25,099
If it was transmitted,
the machine would've caught it.

702
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:27,192
I'll meet you in the lab in one hour.
I wanna see it.

703
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:31,296
- Jeez, it's not even 7:00 a.m.
- I'm not fucking around!
Do you understand me?

704
00:57:31,373 --> 00:57:35,002
Well, fuck you. I'm not some fucking
servomechanism you can switch on.

705
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:38,911
You want me to run around like an
asshole, tell me what I'm doing it for.

706
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:42,007
- Otherwise, I'll see you
during office hours.
- Harlan.

707
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:44,018
You're right.

708
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:47,852
It's momentum. I'm runnin'
like an express train here.
I don't know how to stop.

709
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:50,391
Look, I'll meet you
in the lab in one hour.

710
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:54,190
Okay? And then we'll see if we
pulled in any Videodrome last night...

711
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,197
and I'll tell you
what's going on.

712
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:58,790
Everything. I promise.
Okay?

713
00:57:58,868 --> 00:58:02,565
Okay. I'm sorry
if I freaked out on you.

714
00:58:02,638 --> 00:58:05,573
- I don't work with you for the money.
- I know that.

715
00:58:05,641 --> 00:58:08,542
With pirates, it's never
just for the money, is it?

716
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:13,014
You want a cup of cof... No, look.
I'll meet you in the lab in an hour.

717
00:58:53,722 --> 00:58:55,656
Come on in.

718
00:58:57,026 --> 00:59:00,826
- [Door Closes]
- Did you look at the tape?

719
00:59:00,896 --> 00:59:05,230
- Did you see me on Videodrome?
- There was no tape.

720
00:59:05,301 --> 00:59:10,034
- There was no Videodrome
transmission last night?
- Not last night.

721
00:59:10,105 --> 00:59:12,573
- Aw, fuck!
- Not ever.

722
00:59:15,044 --> 00:59:16,978
What... What are you
talking about?

723
00:59:18,047 --> 00:59:19,981
[Knocking At Door]

724
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:24,080
I'm out of my depth now,
patron.

725
00:59:24,153 --> 00:59:26,644
I had to bring in
the reinforcements.

726
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,798
Max.

727
00:59:39,234 --> 00:59:43,466
An intriguing combination.
Very interesting.

728
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:46,906
- Don't let me interrupt.
- I think I was saying something like,

729
00:59:46,976 --> 00:59:49,069
"What are you talking about?"

730
00:59:49,144 --> 00:59:52,011
I was playing you
tapes, Max.

731
00:59:52,081 --> 00:59:54,345
Prerecorded cassettes.

732
00:59:54,416 --> 00:59:59,877
Videodrome has never been transmitted
on an open broadcast circuit.

733
00:59:59,955 --> 01:00:04,654
- Not yet.
- I guess Barry sent you here,
what, two years ago?

734
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:09,289
It has been... two years,
hasn't it, Harlan?

735
01:00:09,365 --> 01:00:13,028
Two. Two wonderful years.

736
01:00:13,102 --> 01:00:15,297
Why?

737
01:00:17,473 --> 01:00:19,805
[Exhales]

738
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:21,934
To get you involved.

739
01:00:23,879 --> 01:00:26,507
To expose you
to the Videodrome signal.

740
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:30,678
It didn't affect you because
you never watched it!

741
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:35,412
You knew what was there.
You didn't have to see it.

742
01:00:35,491 --> 01:00:40,258
[Chuckles] It really does work
on just about anybody.

743
01:00:40,329 --> 01:00:42,820
Anybody who watches it, Max.

744
01:00:42,898 --> 01:00:45,594
But why would
anybody watch it?

745
01:00:47,069 --> 01:00:51,403
Why would anybody watch
a scum show like Videodrome?

746
01:00:51,473 --> 01:00:53,441
Why did you watch it, Max?

747
01:00:53,509 --> 01:00:55,841
Business reasons.

748
01:00:55,911 --> 01:00:59,677
Sure. Sure.

749
01:00:59,748 --> 01:01:02,182
What about
the other reasons?

750
01:01:02,251 --> 01:01:06,779
Why deny you get your kicks
out of watching torture and murder?

751
01:01:06,855 --> 01:01:09,585
You murdered Brian O'Blivion,
didn't you, you freak?

752
01:01:09,658 --> 01:01:12,024
Did you enjoy that?

753
01:01:19,735 --> 01:01:22,636
North America's
getting soft, patron.

754
01:01:22,705 --> 01:01:26,072
And the rest of the world
is getting tough.

755
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,632
Very, very tough.

756
01:01:28,711 --> 01:01:31,737
We're entering savage
new times,

757
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:35,045
and we're going
to have to be pure...

758
01:01:35,117 --> 01:01:37,142
and direct...

759
01:01:37,219 --> 01:01:40,017
and strong...

760
01:01:40,089 --> 01:01:42,023
if we're gonna
survive them.

761
01:01:42,091 --> 01:01:46,790
Now, you and this, uh,

762
01:01:46,862 --> 01:01:50,298
cesspool you call
a television station...

763
01:01:50,365 --> 01:01:53,357
and, uh, your people
who wallow around in it...

764
01:01:53,435 --> 01:01:55,995
and, uh, your viewers...

765
01:01:56,071 --> 01:01:59,598
who watch you do it...

766
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:02,735
you're rotting us away
from the inside.

767
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,914
We intend
to stop that rot.

768
01:02:06,982 --> 01:02:09,917
We're gonna start
with Channel 83, Max.

769
01:02:09,985 --> 01:02:13,921
We're gonna use it for our first
authentic transmissions of Videodrome.

770
01:02:13,989 --> 01:02:18,449
I have a hunch it's gonna be
very popular... for a while.

771
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:21,519
I've gotta be hallucinating now, right?
I mean...

772
01:02:21,597 --> 01:02:25,863
[Chuckles] you two can't
possibly be for real.

773
01:02:27,402 --> 01:02:30,166
Ah, we did record
your hallucinations, Max,

774
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:33,402
as I said we would.

775
01:02:33,475 --> 01:02:35,966
And we did analyze them.

776
01:02:37,946 --> 01:02:40,176
You're ready
for something new.

777
01:02:40,249 --> 01:02:42,080
That's terrific.

778
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:47,321
[Breathing]

01:17:43,682 --> 01:17:46,014
- Stay with Mommy.
- I want... I wanna see it.

940
01:17:46,084 --> 01:17:48,018
You come with me.

941
01:17:48,086 --> 01:17:50,020
Come on.
We're going home now.

01:19:19,844 --> 01:19:23,041
Well, you know me.

947
01:19:23,114 --> 01:19:26,083
- [Man] Yeah, we know you.
- And I sure know you.

948
01:19:26,151 --> 01:19:29,086
- Every one of you!
- [Applause]

949
01:19:32,857 --> 01:19:37,094
We're here to celebrate
the arrival of our spring collection,

950
01:19:37,227 --> 01:19:39,096
the Medici line,

951
01:19:39,096 --> 01:19:43,795
and our theme for this year
is based on two quotes...

952
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:47,735
from the famous Renaissance statesman
and patron of the arts...

953
01:19:47,804 --> 01:19:50,204
Lorenzo de Medici.

954
01:19:50,273 --> 01:19:52,264
"Love comes in at the eye,"

955
01:19:52,342 --> 01:19:54,503
and " The eye
is the window of the soul."

956
01:19:54,578 --> 01:19:58,309
Now, I think that even Pete...

957
01:19:58,381 --> 01:20:03,717
oughta be able to sell the hell
out of a classy campaign like that.

[Water Dripping]

971
01:23:34,831 --> 01:23:37,425
I was hoping you'd be back.

972
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:39,593
I'm here to guide you, Max.

973
01:23:39,669 --> 01:23:43,036
I've learned a lot
since I last saw you.

974
01:23:43,106 --> 01:23:46,303
I've learned that death
is not the end.

975
01:23:46,376 --> 01:23:48,276
I can help you.

976
01:23:48,345 --> 01:23:51,678
I don't know
where I am now.

977
01:23:51,748 --> 01:23:54,683
I'm having trouble...

978
01:23:54,751 --> 01:23:56,719
finding my way around.

979
01:23:56,786 --> 01:24:01,780
That's because you've gone
just about as far as you can
with the way things are.

980
01:24:01,858 --> 01:24:06,386
Videodrome still exists.
It's very big, very complex.

981
01:24:06,463 --> 01:24:10,229
You've hurt them, but you
haven't destroyed them.

982
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:13,269
To do that, you have to
go on to the next phase.

983
01:24:13,336 --> 01:24:15,998
What phase is that?

984
01:24:16,072 --> 01:24:19,371
Your body has already
done a lot of changing,

985
01:24:19,442 --> 01:24:21,433
but that's
only the beginning,

986
01:24:21,511 --> 01:24:25,504
the beginning
of the new flesh.

987
01:24:25,582 --> 01:24:30,849
You have to go all the way now.
Total transformation.

988
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:32,911
Do you think you're ready?

989
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:37,987
I guess I am.

990
01:24:38,061 --> 01:24:40,120
How do we do it?

991
01:24:40,196 --> 01:24:44,929
To become the new flesh,
you first have to kill the old flesh.

992
01:24:46,002 --> 01:24:48,368
But don't be afraid.

993
01:24:48,438 --> 01:24:52,534
Don't be afraid
to let your body die.

994
01:24:52,609 --> 01:24:54,941
Just come to me, Max.

995
01:24:55,011 --> 01:24:57,912
Come to Nicki.

996
01:24:57,981 --> 01:25:00,814
Watch. I'll show you how.

997
01:25:00,884 --> 01:25:02,818
It's easy.

998
01:25:30,713 --> 01:25:32,977
Long live the new flesh.
