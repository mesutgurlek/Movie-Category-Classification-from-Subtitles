has he left the university?

He was doing so well, and he
seemed so happy with his work.

and electro-biology

In fact, they had reached
a most advanced stage.

They were
becoming dangerous.

138
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,341
Herr Frankenstein
is greatly changed.

139
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,010

The bodies we use in our
dissecting room for lecture purposes

145
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:01,196
were not perfect enough
for his experiments, he said.

146
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,199
He wished us to supply him
with other bodies,

147
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:08,537
and we were not to be too particular
as to where and how we got them.

148
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,915
I told him that his
demands were unreasonable,

149
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,043
and so he left the
university to work unhampered.

150

he needed elsewhere.

Oh. The bodies of animals.

152

what I mean.

then recreate it.

very welcome.

Please.

00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:20,987
Dr. Waldman, I learned a great
deal from you at the university

270
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:24,199
about the violet ray,
the ultraviolet ray,

271
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,911
which you said was the
highest color in the spectrum.

272
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,205
You were wrong.

273
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,960
Here in this machinery,
I have gone beyond that.

274
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:42,092
I have discovered the great ray that
first brought life into the world.

275
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,135
Oh. And your proof?

276
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,430
Tonight you shall
have your proof.

277
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,435
At first, I experimented
only with dead animals

278
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,898
and then a human heart, which
I kept beating for three weeks.

279
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,275
But now,

280
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,238
I'm going to turn
that ray on that body

281
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,407
and endow it with life.

282
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,452
And you really believe that
you can bring life to the dead?

283
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,497
That body is not dead.

284

285
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,252

something wrong.

327
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:48,379
And I have two eyes,
pretty good ones, at that.

328
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,547
Well, what is it?

329
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,466
You're quite
mistaken, Baron.

330
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:54,302
What's the matter with
my son? What's he doing?

331
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,846
He's completing his
experiments, that's all.

332
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,016
Why does he go messing around
an old, ruined windmill,

333
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,894
when he has a decent
house, a bath,

334
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,856
good food and drink and a darned
pretty girl to come back to?

335
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,691
(SCOFFS)
Will you tell me that?

336
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,485
Oh, Baron,
you don't understand.

337
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,612
I understand
perfectly well.

338
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,157
There's another woman, and
you're afraid to tell me.

339
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,160
Pretty sort of
experiments these must be.

340
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,578
Oh, but you're wrong.

341
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,538
And how do you know?

342
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,250
If you please, Herr
Baron, the Burgomaster.

343
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,627
Well, tell him
to go away.

344
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:29,170
But he says
it's important.

345
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:33,174
Nothing the Burgomaster can say
can be of the slightest importance.

346
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,720
Good day,
Herr Baron. Fräulein.

347
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:39,973
Well, what do you want?

348
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:43,059
If it's trouble, go away.
I have trouble enough.

349
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:44,769
Oh, there's
no trouble, sir.

350
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,356
What do you mean, "No trouble"?
There's nothing but trouble.

351
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,483
I brought you
these flowers.

352
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,485
Thank you, Herr Vogel.

353
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,739
Both in my private and official
capacities as Burgomaster...

354
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:00,243
Yes, yes, yes, yes, we know all
about that, but what do you want?

355
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,620
Well, what I really
want to know is,

356
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:05,123
when will the wedding be,
if you please?

357
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,417
Unless Henry
comes to his senses,

358
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,252
there'll be
no wedding at all.

359
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,088
But, Herr Baron, the
village is already prepared!

360
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:13,923
Well, tell them
to unprepare.

361
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,551
Oh, but such
a lovely bride.

362
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:19,637
Such a fine young man, the
very image of his father.

363
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:20,930
Heaven forbid.

364
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,890
But, sir,
everything is ready!

365
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,269
I know that. Don't keep
on saying so, you idiot.

366
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,604
There's nothing
to cry about.

367
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,857
Good day, Miss Elizabeth. (COUGHS)

368
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,817
Good day,
Herr Moritz.

369
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,402
Good day, Herr Vogel.

370
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,072
Good day, Herr Baron.

371
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,200
And good riddance
to you.

372
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,954
There you are.
You see how it is.

373
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,206
The whole village
is kept waiting.

374
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,292
The bride is
kept waiting.

375
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,919
And I am kept waiting.

376
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:54,630
Henry must come home, if
I have to fetch him myself.

377
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,424
No, no, Baron. What
do you mean, "No, no"?

378
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,508
What about his work?

379
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,469
Stuff and nonsense!
What about his wedding?

380
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,929
There is another woman,

381
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,974
and I'm going to find her.

382
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,774
(SIGHS)

383
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,614
Oh, come
and sit down, Doctor.

384
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,991
You must be patient.

385
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,786
Do you expect
perfection at once?

386
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,748
This creature of yours
should be kept under guard!

387
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,626
Mark my words,
he will prove dangerous!

388
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,337
Dangerous?

389
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,839
Poor old Waldman.

390
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,846
Have you never wanted to do
anything that was dangerous?

391
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:47,809
Where should we be if nobody
tried to find out what lies beyond?

392
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:52,313
Have you never wanted to look
beyond the clouds and the stars,

393
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,149
or to know what causes
the trees to bud,

394
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:58,319
and what changes
a darkness into light?

395
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,659
But if you talk like that,
people call you crazy.

396
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,665
Well, if I could discover
just one of these things,

397
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,543
what eternity is, for example,

398
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:18,047
I wouldn't care if they
did think I was crazy!

399
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:22,135
You're young, my friend. Your
success has intoxicated you.

400
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,138
Wake up and
look facts in the face.

401
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,850
Here we have a fiend
whose brain...

402
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,310
Whose brain must be
given time to develop.

403
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,522
It's a perfectly
good brain, Doctor.

404
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:38,484
Well, you ought to know. It
came from your own laboratory.

405
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:43,698
The brain that was stolen from my
laboratory was a criminal brain.

406
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,711
Oh, well. After all, it's
only a piece of dead tissue.

407
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,088
Only evil can come of it.

408
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,592
Your health will be ruined if
you persist in this madness.

409
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:05,011
I'm astonishingly
sane, Doctor.

410
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,890
You have created a monster,
and it will destroy you!

411
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,850
Patience, patience.

412
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,562
I believe in this monster,
as you call it,

413
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,690
and if you don't, well,
you must leave me alone.

414
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,401
But think of Elizabeth,
your father.

415
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,612
Elizabeth believes in me.

416
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,781
My father never
believes in anyone.

417
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,286
I've got to
experiment further.

418
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,247
He's only a few days old,
remember.

419
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:36,292
So far he's been kept
in complete darkness.

420
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,545

into the light.

Very foreseeing of her to prevent
my grandfather drinking this.

Mr. Henry
doesn't need this.

01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:57,174
Well, as I said before,
I say again.

Here's to a son to the
house of Frankenstein.

ALL: Indeed, sir.
We hope so, sir.
