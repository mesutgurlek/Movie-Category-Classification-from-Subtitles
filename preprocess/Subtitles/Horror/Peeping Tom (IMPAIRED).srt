When I came in, were you
looking at some films?

156
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,150
- Yes.
- Of yours?

157
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,160
- Yes.
- I'd like to see them.

158
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,788
Oh, I know
I'm being rude,

159
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,798
but I really would like
to see them.

160
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,302
It would be a birthday present
from you to me.

161
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,803
- Would it?
- Mmm.

162
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:04,400
- Oh.
- But I'm-I'm sure you're too busy and...

163
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,535
Will you...

164
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:12,206
- Would you like to see them now?
- Oh, thank you.

165
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,818
I'll go first.

166
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,658
Oh, it's dark.

167
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:32,568
Is that better?

168
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:36,039
But it's enormous.

169
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,976
Oh. Terribly sorry.

170
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,713
- What are these?
- Chemicals.

171
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,719
Oh.

172
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:58,054
This is, well...
It's so many things, but...

173
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,726
above all, it's so
completely unexpected.

174
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,646
- These all yours?
- Yes.

175
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,480
I mean, did you
do all this?

176
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,247
Mark, tell me
about this room.

177
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,017
- It-lt belonged to my father.
- Oh?

178
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,218
- What was he?
- A scientist.

179
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,592
Oh. Then this
equipment was his?

180
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,359
No, l-I sold his
to buy it.

181
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,367
- Sit down.
- Oh!

182
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,927
This all seems so,
well, terribly technical.

183
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,941
If this is where you work,
I can't wait to see what you work at.

184
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,244
Mark?

185
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:54,150
- Don't know what to show you.
- Well, what were you looking at
when I interrupted you?

186
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,483
All right.

187
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,305
Helen,

188
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:54,005
this is the first 21st birthday present
I'll ever have given.

189
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,306
And it's the first
I've ever asked for.

190
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,957
Thank you.

191
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,503
Mark, what
a beautiful little boy.

192
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,809
- Who is he?
- Me.

193
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,145
Of course it is.

194
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:36,881
- Then who took this film?
- [Mark] My father.

195
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,389
What a wonderful idea.

196
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,392
You'll be able to show it
to your own chil...

197
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,123
Oh, you must've had
a bad dream.

198
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,688
What was the light
in your eye?

199
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,065
Camera, I suppose.

200
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,973
Whatever are you after?

201
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,792
Naughty boy.
I hope you were spanked.

202
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:25,727
Mark, what a strange thing
for your father to photograph.

203
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,738
- [Mark] Switch it off?
- [Helen] No.

204
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,105
No.

205
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,248
Again?

206
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,248
Mark, this isn't
some sort of a joke, is it?

207
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,387
No, Helen.

208
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:59,669
[Screams]
What's that?

209
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:14,317
- Mark, what are you doing?
- Wanted to photograph you watching.

210
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:18,117
No. No. Please help me
to understand this thing.

211
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,332
[Man's Voice]
That will do, Mark.

212
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:37,205
Dry your eyes
and stop being silly.

213
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,409
All right now, Mark.
What was all that about?

214
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,949
That was a lizard,
wasn't it, or a...

215
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,812
A li...

216
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:54,017
Well, how'd it
get there, Mark?

217
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:57,289
How did it get there?
Was it a pet?

218
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:03,932
- Not mine.
- Won't you try to explain?

219
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,870
- You better go.
- I'd like to understand what I'm shown.

220
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,909
What was your father trying to do
to you, photographing you at night?

221
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,117
You better go.

222
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:44,230
Mark, what's this?

223
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,709
I'm saying good-bye...

224
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:51,875
to my... mother.

225
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,114
He photographed that?

226
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:59,179
Yes.

227
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:03,452
And this:
her funeral.

228
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,962
And this:
her burial.

229
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,398
- And this.
- Who's that?

230
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,766
Her successor.

231
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,829
Successor?

232
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:29,487
He married her six weeks after the...
previous sequence.

233
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,359
She filmed
what comes now.

234
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,327
It's out of focus.

235
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,663
Is that your father?

236
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:48,638
The morning he left
for his honeymoon.

237
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:54,175
But what's he doing?

238
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,839
Giving me a present.

239
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,849
What is it?

240
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,908
Can't you guess?

241
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,789
The camera.

242
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,706
Switch it off, Mark!

243
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,610
Mark, switch it off!

244
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,081
Let's get out of here.

245
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,093
Mark?

246
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,808
So, he was a scientist?

247
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,868
What kind
of a scientist, Mark?

248
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:05,245
- Biologist.
- What was he trying to do to you?

249
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,910
Mark, what was he trying
to do to you?

250
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:11,945
Watch me grow up.

251
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,958
He wanted a record
of a growing child,

252
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,655
complete in
every detail,

253
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,198
if such a thing
were possible.

254
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:26,135
And he tried to make it possible
by training a camera on me at all times.

255
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:30,197
I never knew the whole of my childhood
one moment's privacy.

256
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:34,507
And those lights in your eyes
and that thing.

257
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,911
He was interested
in the reactions...

258
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,917
of the nervous system
to... to fear.

259
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,078
Fear?

260
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,556
Fear.

261
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:56,595
Especially fear in children
and how they react to it.

262
00:28:56,668 --> 00:29:00,263
I think he learned
a lot from me.

263
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,932
I'd wake up
sometimes screaming.

264
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:07,774
He'd be there
taking notes and pictures,

265
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,474
and I'm sure good
came of it...

266
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,880
for some people.

267
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:16,717
- He was brilliant.
- A scientist drops a lizard
onto a child's bed,

268
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,722
and good comes of it?

270
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,535
Excuse me, but...

Oh, there you are, Helen.

Look, I tell you, Mr. Jarvis, this
picture is a commercial proposition,

283
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:24,080
and that's why I want you
to do it because I know it's
the type of thing you handle.

00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,886
Look, you know I've talked
to Johnnie already. I've talked
to him, and he's crazy to do it.

you wanted, Mr. Jarvis.

that Paramount want it.

Yeah. Paramount want it.
MGM want it. Columbia want it.

- [Jarvis] But is it commercial?
- [Man] Anglo want it.

We'll discuss it next week.

to look stunned?

- [Director] Cut!

Phil? Sam? Mark?

Hold take one.

315
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,370
- Okay. Alex, that's it.
- All right, boys and girls. Wrap it up.

316
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:58,677
8:30 in the morning. You're wonderful,
darling. You were really feeling it.

317
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:06,918
- Catching the bus?
- Not tonight.
Meeting someone for a drink.

318
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,551
Oh. I wanted to discuss
that film at the Everyman.

319
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:11,561
- Tomorrow then?
- I hope so.

320
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:16,498

- Standing it.

Viv, how about having a drink
with me on the way home?

323
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,335
I've got a date,
Mr. Tate.

324
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,018
Good night,
Miss Vivian.

325
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:48,131
Yeah, Sergeant,
who's working late tonight then?

326
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,394
That Indian picture,
The Elephant with Two Tails.

327
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,936
- A bit crowded, aren't you?
- She'll take eight at a pinch.

328
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,131
- Which is what we'll probably get.
- Go on.

329
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:58,972
Well, I don't mind. Might as well get
pinched in a car as squeezed in a bus.

Oh, you frightened me.
Now listen.

00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,010
They're working late
on the lot.

I know. They've branched
off this stage.

- We must call it off.

interrupt us while we're filming.

- You've what?

- I've put the red light on. Would you...
- But...

00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,109
Would you please stand
over there?

353
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,773
But then they'll know
someone's here.

354
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:34,875
- They won't come in.
- Well, they'll wait outside.
What's the difference?

355
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:38,718
The difference is
a perfect film.

for this and so have you.

- We'll be caught.

- Oh, matter!

359

- Extra? Stand-in.

00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,626
even he would say...

- Who's he? Don Jarvis?
- Hmm?

367
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:26,794

me to death?

Oh, set the mood
for me, Mark.

someone coming
towards you...

430
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:32,330
who wants to kill you...

the consequences.

- A madman?
- Yes.

But he knows it,
and you don't.

434
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:50,111
And just to kill you
isn't enough for him.

435
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:55,591
- But how does that...
- Stay there, Viv.

436
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,854
You're just right.

437

what you've thought of.

would be one

Yes.

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,442
- That.
- Mark.

would be frightening.

- Doesn't matter.
- Mother, what's worrying you?

466
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,446

00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:02,047
Haven't met him.

469
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,111
You don't like him.
Why not?

470
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:08,852
I don't trust a man
who walks quietly.

471
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,588
Well, he's shy.

472
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,962
- His footsteps aren't. They're stealthy.
- Now, really, Mother.

473
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,368
- You going up to see him?
- May I?

474
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:28,310
We both have the key of the door.
Mine needs oiling.

475
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:33,475
- Yours needs exercise. Off you go.
- Thank you.

476
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:39,049
- Remember you lost the draw.
- Mm-hmm.

477
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,818
- Helen?
- Yes?

478
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:47,296
If you're back in five minutes,
I won't even finish this.

479
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,355
Done.

480
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,270
[Door Closes]

481
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,705
- [Knock On Door]
- Who is it?

482
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:08,808
- It's Helen.
- Oh.

483
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,616
Come in, Helen.

484
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:14,623
Would you just
wait in there?

485
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,625
Developing.

486
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,259
Mother heard you come in,
so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed.

487
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,796
Are you sure
this is convenient?

488
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:33,570
- Won't be long!
- [Timer Ticking]

489
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:58,659
[Man's Voice] I wish to express
my gratitude to the following people...

490
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:01,135
for their
valuable contributions:

491
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,173
Professor A.D. Smith
of New York University,

492
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:09,406
Mr. Edward Paton of the Belgravia
Institute of Nervous Diseases...

493
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:12,971
and Mark Lewis,
my son.

494
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:16,314
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mark.

495
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:19,446
l-I hope
you don't mind.

496
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:30,165
I'm sure I'm being a nuisance,
but, Mark, I very much want to...

497
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:37,195
- Happy birthday.
- Mark, that's very sweet
of you, but really.

498
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:41,233
It isn't much.
l-I don't know anything about...

499
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,745
21st birthday presents,

500
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,839
but I saw it
this morning, so...

501
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:48,214
- Please.
- Mark.

502
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,412
Thank you.

503
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,921
Oh, it's beautiful.

504
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,584
I liked it.

505
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,627
- More milk?
- More?

506
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,924
- Milk?
- Oh, no thank you.

507
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,830
I'm gonna put
it on now.

508
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:06,027
There or... or there?

509
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:11,302
- Uh... first place.
- Yes, I think so too.

510
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:24,720
- Oh, I am keeping you.
- Oh. Oh, no.

511
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,757
l... I promise.

512
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,987
Mark, I'm here
for some advice.

513
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:35,555
- F-From me?
- Please.

514
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:41,069
You see, I work in a public library
in the children's section.

515
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:45,040
I'm telling you that to postpone
admitting what always embarrasses me.

516
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:48,134
- In my spare time, I write.
- What's embarr...

517
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:52,807
I write short stories for
children, but so did Grimm,
Hans Anderson and Lewis Carroll.

518
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,681
- Had any published?
I'd like to read them.
- Some short stories.

519
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:59,882
I learned today that
my first book has been accepted
for publication in the spring.

520
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:04,393
- But... But Helen, th-that's wonderful.
- Yes.

521
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,692
- What is it about?
- A magic camera and what it photographs.

522
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:14,332
What... Whatever made
you think of that?

523
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,771
I'll tell you one day.
I promise.

524
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:24,977
- W-What does it photograph?
- I'll tell you that too,
but Mark, this is the problem.

525
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:28,540
The children who read the book will want
to see the pictures the camera takes,

526
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:32,019
but the publishers say they're
impossible to photograph,
and they suggest drawings.

527
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,957
- But you see, I don't agree.
- Oh, no. Nothing's impossible.

528
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,960
Oh, I was hoping
you'd say that.

529
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,326
There must be photographs,
however difficult to take,

530
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,331
- And Mark, I was wondering if...
- Oh, yes.

531
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,333
- You'll discuss it with me?
- Take them.

532
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,335
Well, I can't ask you
to do that.

533
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,963
I mean, the publishers
mightn't agree.

534
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:51,803
- I'd like to take them for you.
- But the money.

535
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:55,743
There are some things
which I...

536
00:51:55,812 --> 00:52:01,216
- Photograph for nothing.
- I didn't mean to offend you.

537
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:04,117
- Offend?
- Then you'll talk it over with me?

538
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,155
- When, please?
- That's up to you.

539
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:08,157
- Are you free tomorrow night?
- Yes.

540
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:11,388
- I hope I am.
- Well, I'll understand if you're not.

541
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:15,295
I'll try.
I'll try my hardest to be.

542
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:18,596
Thank you for listening...

543
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:22,104
and for my present.

544
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,675
- Good night.
- Good night.

545
00:52:36,786 --> 00:52:39,687
[Ringing]

546
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:57,132
- Looking for a trunk?
- Uh, yes. I'd like to see that one.

547
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,141
Certainly, Madam.

548
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:08,445
No. No, no,
no, no, no, no.

549
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,578
We must have some comedy
in this scene.

550
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:15,648
- We'll retake it today.
- Very good, sir.

551
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:18,455
The thing about this scene is
I must have some comedy in it.

552
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,894
Now you do understand, darling,
don't you? You see,

553
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:24,798
that instead of taking the first trunk,
I want you to ask to see a red one.

554
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,836
And when he brings that,
I want you to look around...

555
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:29,030
- And ask... excuse me a second, darling...
- [Woman] Sorry.

556
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:32,370
for a white one,
then when he brings the white one,

557
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:37,846
then you ask for a different one...
this one, the blue one.

558
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:40,542
And you, Michael, bring the trunks one
by one, getting more and more fed up.

559
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:42,551
- [Michael] I'll keep it light.
- I'm sure you will.

560
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:45,247
Then we'll end up on some sort of
a gag I'll think of in a minute.

561
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:49,122
- Understand? What?
- I don't feel it.

562
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:53,322
- Don't feel it.
- Don't feel it, just do it!

563
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,365
- All right. Positions, everybody.
- [Man] Anyone seen Viv?

564
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,766
- [Director] Who?
- Oh, Diane's stand-in.
I want to light the set.

565
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:02,805
- [Director]
No, Phil. I want to run it first.
- [Man] All right, quiet.

566
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:04,840
[Director]
All right. Ready? Action.

567
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,877
- [Michael] Here we are, Madam.
- [Diane]
Oh, I'd like to see one in red.

568
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,276
Certainly, Madam.

569
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:13,282
[Director Muttering]

570
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,181
Do you remember
doing it?

571
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:23,022
Right. Ready for you,
and back you go.

572
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:26,756
- Play for a close-up there.
- Um, do you have one in white?

573
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,822
Certainly, Madam.

574
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:32,163
[Director]
There's a white one there behind you.

575
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:34,635
Right here. Again.

576
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,406
Good, Michael.
Excellent.

577
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,968
All right.
Back again.

578
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:47,642
- Oh, um, do you have one in blue?
- Certainly, Madam.

579
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:52,287
[Director]
That's it, and back you go.

580
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,482
[Continues, Indistinct]

581
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:59,426
That's it. Just take what you can
without overdoing it.

582
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,363
Play it lightly, Michael.

583
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:09,371
Right. When it's in position,
keep it tight, enter him there.

584
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,430
Very good.

585
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,947
[Screams]

586
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:22,644
The silly bitch.
She's fainted in the wrong scene.

587
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,653
[Bell Ringing]

588
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,787
- Excuse me, Chief?
- Mmm?

589
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:33,852
Um, we pass my place
at the end of the bypass.

590
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,057
Do you mind if I
drop in for a moment?

591
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:38,999
- To collect your kid's autograph book?
- That's it, Chief.

592
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,401
- If the nipper finds out
where I've been...
- All right, Dawson.

593
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,598
Anything to help
the sergeant.

594
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:48,007
It's about time the sergeant
helped me. We're not getting
anywhere with this Soho murder.

595
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:51,275
Well, what about that chap
the landlady passed on the stairs?

596
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,283
She couldn't describe him except
to say that he was carrying
something she couldn't see.

597
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:58,788
- Oh, that's a help.
- Sergeant, I've been
on the force 30 years,

598
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:03,690
and I've never seen such fear
on anyone's face as on this girl's.

599
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,562
- What was it she saw?
- Well, surely, a man coming
at her with a sharp weapon.

600
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,260
Mmm. I'm familiar with
that kind of terror.

601
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:15,896
This is something new to me.
But what?

602
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:21,610
That's the one, sir.

603
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:37,088
- Chief, the expression. It's exactly...
- I know.

604
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,185
Don't say anything.

605
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,438
Well, sir, we shall probably
have to interview everyone,

606
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:55,000
so we better plan a campaign
that won't interfere too much
with your productions.

607
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:59,947
Oh, thank you, Chief Inspector.
If you knew what even
a single day's delay could cost.

608
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:03,315
Oh, uh, we do, sir.

609
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,081
- Hello, Mark.
- [Mark] Hello.

610
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,428
- Hey, I don't think
you ought to do that.
- Sorry, sir.

611
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:21,402
- Do what?
- Make me famous.
Some chap's giving me a screen test.

612
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:25,305
Gerry, you're next. Don't look
so scared. They can't eat you.

613
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:29,038
Looks as though it's going
to be an early night tonight.

614
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:32,240

- Oh.

- Have you been filming those policemen?
- Hmm.

I have a few quite
interesting shots of them.

- It's a chance I never expected.
- Chance for what?

618
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:45,454
To photograph
an investigation...

619
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:48,463
or as much of it
as I can get.

What on Earth for?

621
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:53,730
It will complete
a documentary.

- Documentary, huh? What's it about?
- Mmm.

I'd rather not tell you

- Oh, they will.
They look very efficient.

- No.

- Yes.

Do you think
they'll notice?

Ah, my photographer.

I brought you the camera in case
you wanted to take the film away.

- That's all right, Mr. Lewis.

As long as we don't appear at the local
next week in place of the cartoon.

anything to tell us?

- I don't think so, sir.
- Did you know the girl?

- Yes, sir.
- How well?

643
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:13,648
- Mainly by sight.
- Mm-hmm.

00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:19,211

- Yesterday afternoon before we broke.

Don't know if she heard me.

- Oh, taking some shots.

Right.
I'll tell 'im.

his examination,

to see you.

About 10:00, 10:30.

- Yes. The people who live downstairs.

Direct me to that set of yours,
would you?

669
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:55,249
I'd probably end up
on location.

Famished!
- Hmm. Good.

around the corner.

- People.

gone to bed.

That's what I was
going to say.

It was a wonderful evening.

01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,814
And you made it wonderful...

I wonder how
this sees grown-ups.

Thank you again
for my evening.

Will you go to bed now,
and not stop up watching those films?

Well, l...

I've got some
work to do.

Then I'll
go to bed,

your faces.

- How did you...

813

The young man bathing himself
brought me to your door.

I managed the rest
of the adventure alone.

This is one room
I expected to find locked.

I was never
allowed keys.

- A talk.

Visit?

825
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:13,311
The blind always live
in the rooms they live under.

826
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:31,926
Every night you switch on
that film machine.

827
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:37,798
What are these films
you can't wait to look at?

828
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,075
What's the film
you're showing now?

Why don't you
lie to me?

- You would know at once.

- Take me to your cinema.
- Yes.

What am I seeing, Mark?

Why don't you answer?

Oh!

It's no good.

I was afraid
it wouldn't be.

Where are you?

Why are you putting
that light on my face?

01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,573

- [Film Rolling]

It's for Helen.

01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:35,555
What do you mean,
"It's for Helen"?

852
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:38,491
She wanted to see
something I photographed.

853
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,994
My daughter sees enough
of my face without photographs.

01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:45,523
Please, don't-
don't be frightened.

Not frightened.
Hot.

01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:53,506
So put that
camera away!

Yes.

aren't you?

01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:44,553
You-You can take some more pictures,
if you want to.

864
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:46,560
No, thank you.

865
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:48,858
Why not?

01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:52,058

Can't you find some more
to please Helen?

868
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:58,164
No. No.

869
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,740
You... You don't
trust yourself...

870
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,744
to take any more,
do you?

871
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:08,678
Instinct's a wonderful thing,
isn't it, Mark?

872
01:18:10,419 --> 01:18:13,411
A pity it
can't be photographed.

873
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:18,925
If I'd listened to it
years ago, l...

874
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:21,554
I might have
kept my sight.

875
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:26,960
I wouldn't have let a man
operate I had no faith in.

876
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:30,436
So, I'm listening
to my instinct now.

877
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:40,909
And it says all this
filming isn't healthy,

878
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:43,644
and that
you need help.

879
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,880
Get it, Mark.

880
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:48,354
Get it quickly.

881
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:52,154
And until you do, I don't want you
and Helen to see each other.

01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:54,161
I will never photograph her,
I promise you.

883
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:58,222
I'd rather you don't have the chance.
I mean it, Mark.

884
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:02,935
And if you don't
listen to me,

885
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:05,768
one of us will move
from this house.

886

It would be a pity, because we'll
never find a cheaper place.

You'll never have to move because of me.

Uh, have you
one in red?

927
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:31,845
Certainly, madam.

Have you one in blue?

929

- No. Break forever!

All right, boys and girls.
Break it up. Back in half an hour.

- Oh, it's jolly interesting.

936
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,545
No. I mean to help her...
psychologically.

937

Oh, uh, give her a proper rest.
Half an hour is useless.

- A. N. Lewis.

945

Oh, of course
I knew him.

He lectured to me.
An extraordinary man.

before he died?

No. Tell me.
Tell me.

950
01:23:56,998 --> 01:24:00,456
l-I don't remember
what he called it,

951
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:04,494
but it has something
to do with what...

952
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:08,269
what causes people
to be Peeping Toms.

953
01:24:08,343 --> 01:24:12,837

are there any of his manuscripts left?

956
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:23,716
- I thought it could be cured.
- Usually. Yeah.

957
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,919
- Now about his manuscripts.
- Quickly.

958
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:29,862
The cure. Oh, very quick. A couple
of years' analysis three times a week,

959
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:33,094
an hour a time
and soon it's uprooted.

Now, are there any
of his papers left?

if I could see them.

I got some more,
if you're interested.

You've given me...
an idea.

Hey, I'll bet
I have.

975
01:25:44,172 --> 01:25:46,640
He asked me if I knew his father,
which I did.

976
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:49,268
- Brilliant man.
- Is that all he wanted?

977
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:53,007
I think so. Oh, we had
a little chat about scoptophilia.

- And he's going to... Voyeurism.

Peeping Tom?

982
01:26:04,025 --> 01:26:07,017
Interesting boy.
He has his father's eyes.

983

do you?

987
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,198
There's something
on his mind.

01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:23,301
No wonder.
He's the director.

might be my only chance.

at 6:00, Mark.

- You'd better be.

Make it a good one.
- Okay.

01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:50,630
- You got your list, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

998
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:53,765
I want to see how some of them
spend their spare time.

- Which ones?
- Exactly, Sergeant.

Now, don't make a habit of this.
- I won't, sir.

I may not be here tomorrow.

01:35:35,329 --> 01:35:37,763
And you know
some of what he did,

1077
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:41,367
but not all.

1078
01:35:43,871 --> 01:35:46,738
[Child Screaming]

1079
01:35:48,476 --> 01:35:50,671
- Aged five.
- [Screaming Continues]

1080
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:56,774
[Child Crying]

1081
01:35:56,851 --> 01:35:58,785
Aged seven.

1082
01:36:01,756 --> 01:36:05,157
All the rooms
were wired for sound,

1083
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:07,456
and they still are.

1084
01:36:08,829 --> 01:36:10,763
- [Woman Laughing]
- Your room.

1085
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:13,561
- Happy birthday.
- [Man] Here. Open this one.

1086
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:17,593
- [Mrs. Stephens, Indistinct]
- Your mother's.

1087
01:36:17,671 --> 01:36:19,605
[Glass Clinking]

1088
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:24,243
- Tony's.
- [Tony] No one will come in,
honestly, darling.

1089
01:36:24,311 --> 01:36:26,506
- [Woman] I don't care.
- [Tony] But, darling.

1090
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:29,048
- [Woman] Tony, stop it!
- [Tony] The door is locked.

1091
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:31,277
[Woman]
I don't care. I'm scared.

1092
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:35,345
- Turn it off.
- [Clicks]

1093
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:38,323
- Look at me, Mark.
- Not if you're frightened.

1094
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:42,419
Look at me!
What did you do to those girls?

1095
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:45,192
- No.
- What did you do?

1096
01:36:45,266 --> 01:36:48,463
If you want to torment me for the rest
of my life, then make me imagine.

1097
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:51,096
What did you do
to those girls?

1098
01:36:51,172 --> 01:36:53,265
l... I can't.

1099
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:55,274
Show me.
[Sobbing]

1100
01:36:57,111 --> 01:36:59,272
But if you're
frightened...

1101
01:36:59,346 --> 01:37:02,315
Show me, or I'll remain frightened
for the rest of my life.

1102
01:37:02,383 --> 01:37:04,317
Show me!

1103
01:37:22,269 --> 01:37:25,670
Do you know what the most frightening
thing in the world is?

1104
01:37:32,346 --> 01:37:34,280
It's fear.

1105
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:38,284
So I did something
very simple.

1106
01:37:39,787 --> 01:37:41,721
Very simple.

1107
01:37:43,157 --> 01:37:47,423
- [Woman Screaming]
- When they felt the spike...

1108
01:37:47,494 --> 01:37:49,428
touching their throat,

1109
01:37:51,031 --> 01:37:54,228
and knew I was going
to kill them,

1110
01:37:54,301 --> 01:37:58,431
I made them watch
their own deaths.

1111
01:37:59,874 --> 01:38:02,138
I made them see...

1112
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:05,838
their own terror
as the spike went in.

1113
01:38:05,913 --> 01:38:08,848
And if death has a face,

1114
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:11,407
they saw that too.

1115
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,052
But not you.

1116
01:38:15,122 --> 01:38:18,387
I promised I'd never
photograph you.

1117
01:38:18,459 --> 01:38:21,019
Not you.

1118
01:38:21,095 --> 01:38:24,258
[Whimpering]
Frightened for you.

1119
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:26,458
[Siren Blaring]

1120
01:38:28,269 --> 01:38:30,203
[Continues]

1121
01:38:34,341 --> 01:38:36,275
[Tires Squealing]

1122
01:38:41,115 --> 01:38:43,049
- Got the men all right?
- Yes, sir.

1123
01:38:43,117 --> 01:38:45,051
- Okay, let's go.
- [Glass Breaking]
- Look out!

1124
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,712
- It's only a camera.
- Only?

1125
01:38:55,195 --> 01:39:00,326
- Give yourself up, Mark!
- I've been ready for this
for such a long time.

1126
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:04,303
- What are you doing?
- That's all right.

1127
01:39:04,371 --> 01:39:06,703
[Men Yelling]

1128
01:39:08,342 --> 01:39:10,401
[Miller] All right. He's there!
All right. Come on, then!

1129
01:39:10,477 --> 01:39:12,604
I can beat that.

1130
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:15,843
[Cries, Screams Overlapping]

1131
01:39:18,852 --> 01:39:20,786
Give yourself up, Mark!
[Crying]

1132
01:39:24,191 --> 01:39:26,125
Watch them, Helen.

1133
01:39:26,193 --> 01:39:28,184
Watch them say good-bye.

1134
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:32,323
One by one.
I've timed it so often.

1135
01:39:34,401 --> 01:39:37,928
I wish I could have
found your faces for you.

1136
01:39:45,312 --> 01:39:49,271
Helen! Helen!
I'm afraid.

1137
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:52,217
No. No. Mark.
[Sobbing Hysterically]

1138
01:39:53,287 --> 01:39:55,221
[Thudding]

1139
01:39:55,289 --> 01:39:59,123
And I'm glad
I'm afraid.

1140
01:39:59,193 --> 01:40:02,287
[Grunting]

1141
01:40:04,631 --> 01:40:07,657

[Men Grunting]

1144
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:48,874
Girl's alive.

1145
01:40:48,942 --> 01:40:51,376
[Tapes Continue]

1146
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:53,709
Go get an ambulance.

1147
01:40:53,781 --> 01:40:57,615
[Dr. Lewis] All right.
All right. Don't be a silly boy.

1148
01:40:57,684 --> 01:41:00,847
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

1149
01:41:11,098 --> 01:41:14,795
[Young Mark]
Good night, Daddy. Hold my hand.
