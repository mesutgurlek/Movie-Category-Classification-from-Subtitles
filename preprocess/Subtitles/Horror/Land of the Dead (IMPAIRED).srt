1115
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:11,336
Should I call the crew, sir?
No, I'll call them.

1116

[Beeping]

1117
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:34,927
God damn it.

1118
01:24:36,368 --> 01:24:37,858
What the fuck?

[Ululating]

1120
01:24:51,716 --> 01:24:53,274
Goodbye, Mr. K.

1121
01:24:53,351 --> 01:24:56,410
Come back here, you son of a
bitch. You got the fucking keys.

1122

[Beeping]

1126
01:26:51,258 --> 01:26:53,226
Fucking spic bastard.

1127
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,347
Nah. You're dead.

1128
01:27:27,091 --> 01:27:29,559
Oh, my God. You are dead.

[Kaufman screaming]

1132
01:28:03,090 --> 01:28:05,388
Number 1's clear.
Going for Number 2.

1133
01:28:05,459 --> 01:28:07,086
I don't normally need
that many.

1134
01:28:07,161 --> 01:28:09,219
(Anchor)
Don't bother. Come on down.

1135
01:28:12,765 --> 01:28:13,993
Blow the fences.

1136

[Bones crunching]

1140
01:28:46,296 --> 01:28:48,526
Sky flowers
don't work no more.

1141
01:28:50,534 --> 01:28:51,694
Shoot.

1142
01:28:52,869 --> 01:28:54,597
But there's people.

1143
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:57,768
Those people are all dead.
Shoot, Charlie.

1144
01:29:24,298 --> 01:29:25,822
We're too late.

1145
01:29:26,867 --> 01:29:27,890
No.

1146
01:29:29,235 --> 01:29:30,327
Look.

1147
01:29:48,386 --> 01:29:49,910
You saved them.

1148
01:30:06,836 --> 01:30:08,736
You staying or leaving?

1149
01:30:09,105 --> 01:30:10,697
You?
Leaving.

1150
01:30:10,974 --> 01:30:13,203
Unless you need my help.
No.

1151
01:30:13,642 --> 01:30:14,870
Why don't you stick around?

1152
01:30:14,943 --> 01:30:17,673
We could turn this place into
what we always wanted it to be.

1153
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:18,906
Maybe.

1154
01:30:19,948 --> 01:30:23,111
Then what will we turn into?
We'll see, won't we?

1155
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:31,447
You want to go
to Canada now, Riley?

1156
01:30:31,692 --> 01:30:33,922
Sure, if no one
has any objections.

1157
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:36,087
No, we'll take you with us.

1158
01:30:36,896 --> 01:30:38,625
I'll try to make myself
useful.

1159
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:42,191
Anchor, load the guns.
We're hitting the road.

No.

1164
01:31:35,483 --> 01:31:38,111
They're just looking
for a place to go.

1165
01:31:40,388 --> 01:31:41,753
Same as us.

1166
01:31:45,259 --> 01:31:47,625
Fire off what's left inside
those tubes.

1167
01:31:47,695 --> 01:31:49,993
We're not gonna need it
anymore.

1168
01:32:00,573 --> 01:32:02,063
Take us north.
