(Woman #1) Come on.

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,113
Babes?

6
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,477
Let me in. I'll help you.

7
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,114
- (Woman #2) Open up, Tams.
- (Knocking)

8
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,439
- (Woman #2) St Tropez in here?
- Shit.

9
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,788
You all right?

10
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,070
(Woman #1) Come on, you're gorgeous.
(Tammi) I'm a bit of a mess.

11
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,873
I swear, you're gonna love this place.
Trust me.

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,638
(Woman #1) I reckon Ibiza
woulda been better.

13
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,196
Don't wear that. It's not really
my colour. It'll look great on you.

14
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,311
- (Woman #1) You'll look gorgeous.
- (Phone rings)

15
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,311
(Tammi) Where's my phone?

16
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,670
Ryan? Fucking twat.

17
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,236
- Here, pass it.
- Why doesn't he just leave you alone?

18
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,116
- Kim, you wouldn't dare...
- He's toxic, babe.

19
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,350
I don't believe you.

20
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,278
(Woman #1) You promised.
No more contact.

21
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,995
Here's to Tammi, for being brave.

22
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,271
- And a wicked girlie weekend together.
- Three of us.

23
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,992
Three of us.

24
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,078

the start a simple touch

32

# One night to push and scream...

33
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,636

- Right, what's everyone drinking?
- Champagne.

50
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,551
(Man) Champagne. Right.

51
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,513
- You don't have to...
- Might as well buy a bottle, right?

52
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,394
- (Man) Bring it on, my good man.
- Don't posh boys drink this all the time?

53
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,512
I have it on my cornflakes.
I'm Marcus by the way.

54
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,312
- Kim.
- Pleased to meet you.

55
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,158
Pleased to meet you.

56
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,635
Just do one thing for me?

57
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,389
Please.

58
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,432
- What?
- Game on.

59

(Giggling)

60
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,310
Excuse me.
He wants his drink back.

61
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,193
Oh, shit, man! Let's...

62
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,714
- Come on, ladies.
- Are we going now?

63
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,836
So, all right...

64
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,199
Ptchaa!

65
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,998
- Fuck off.
- What?

66
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,678
- That's shit.
- It's not, it's good.

67
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,076
Is that supposed to be a trick?
Like, you're some sort of a magician?

68
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,634
It's not a trick, my dear.
It's an illusion.

69
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,438
Can you believe that yesterday
we was in Leeds in the sodding rain?

70
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,154
- And now we're here.
- I know, babe.

71
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,233
- I told you we'd look after you.
- We'll see yet.

72
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,558
What now, ladies?
Hit another bar or something?

73
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,274
Can't we get a bottle of wine
and drink it here?

74
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,631
You're welcome to come back
to the yacht and have a drink with us.

75
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,398
Yeah.

76
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,876
Right. You were nicking drinks,
but you've got a yacht?

77
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,197
We just wanted you to like us
for who we really are.

78
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,597
- You do not have a boat.
- Kim, they do.

79
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,029
I saw a dinghy parked over there!

80
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,959
- Daddy's boat!
- Course it is.

81
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,640
No, we're crew.
You know those boats in the marina?

82
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,957
- We crew one of those.
- You're sailors?

83
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,071
We just came back off
a three-month stint.

84
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,270
The owner flew out yesterday,
as did the skipper.

85
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,591
- And left you in charge?
- Absolutely. I'm the second mate.

86
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
- Josh here's the deckie.
- Skivvy, more like.

87
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,198
Well, what are you, then?
The onboard hairdresser?

88
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,231
International playboy.

89
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,158
Just flew in from 'biza to check out
my old mucker, the 'coose.

90
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,271
Look, the new crew arrive on Monday.

91
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,551
This is our last weekend together.
What do you say?

92
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,271
Lead the way.

93
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,754
- Here?
- Yeah, sure.

94
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,109
(# PETER, BJORN & JOHN:
"Young Folks")

95
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,236
Ladies first. Then fellas.

96
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,271
It's just up here on the right.

97
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,312
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa, easy...

98
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,473
- How about this?
- Relax. It's going according to plan.

99
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,114
(Josh) Wicked.
(Marcus) Right, you ready?

100
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,638
Is everyone ready?

101
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,191
(Marcus) You guys ready?
(Kim) Yeah.

102
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,993
You lot.
I think we should go back.

103
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,634
- You what?
- No offence, but...

104
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,639
I thought it was just like
a girlie weekend, like the three of us.

105
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,356
Babe, if you want to chill at the beach,
then, we can catch up later, yeah?

106
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,110
Come on, Tam. Don't be mardy, yeah?
We'll just go for one drink.

107
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,549
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
I'm just...

108
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,678
This lot are a laugh.

109
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,635
(Marcus) Ladies and gentlemen, please
allow me to introduce to you the boat.

110
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,230
Seventy-six feet of pure luxury
motor yacht and may I say...

111
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,237
- Sean! Let us on!
- (All) Oi, Sean! Oi, Sean!

112
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,679
Hey.

113
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,073
- Come on, Tam.
- Mmm, all right. One drink.

114
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,758
Wicked.

115
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,513
- I'm Kim, nice to meet you.
- Sean. Nice to meet you.

116
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,517
- All right, mate.
- All right, Blue.

117
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,597
- This is Sean, our engineer.
- Lisa.

118
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,432
- Tammi.
- Sean.

119
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,073
Nice one.

120
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,476
- So... you're Josh's brother?
- For my sins, yeah.

121
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,477
- He been misbehaving?
- A little.

122
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,318
No, bless him.
He's a right sweetheart.

123
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,630
- (Lisa) Kim, check it out.
- What?

124
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,591
(Tammi) What is it?

125
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,871
Marcus and Bluey, man, unstoppable.
We're so on it.

126
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,195
We? Right, what am I supposed
to be doing?

127
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,197
I don't know. Serve drinks?

128
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,191
- What do you think then, eh?
- Hmm, yeah.

129
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,390
- Impressive, or?
- It's not bad.

130
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,513
- You been on a boat before?
- Yeah. Ferry to Ireland.

131
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,758
I think this is a bit bigger.
You gonna give us a tour, then?

132
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,392
All right, yeah. Come on, then.

133
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,115
- Come on.
- Check it out. It's like the Tardis.

134
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,438
Oh, my gosh.

135
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,034
This is the stateroom.
The owner's bedroom.

136
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,549
Bloody heck.
This is bigger than my flat.

137
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,393
It's all right this, isn't it?

138
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,992
- (Josh) Come on.
- Come on.

139
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,512
This is the master guest room.
For VIPs.

140
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,879
That will be us, then.

141
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,116
Come on. Show us the rest.

142
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,115
(Lisa) All right!

143
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,154
Check out these beauties.
They crank out 1,000 horsepower each.

144
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,113
- (Sniggering)
- OK...

145
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,270
Shoulda seen your brother, man.
He rounded them kittens up.

146
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,996
- Yeah, I'm very proud. Marcus...
- Shame he didn't bring one for you.

147
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,432
- Three into four don't go.
- Think I'll have to sit this one out, eh?

148
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,438
Suit yourself.
I'm on Kim like butter on toast.

149
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,994
Marcus has that other one.

150
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,156
- Lisa.
- Yeah, Lisa.

151
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,111
Funbags fitted as standard.

152
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,912
Funbags?

153
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,191
That leaves you and little Josh
fighting for bronze.

154
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,278
Get in there.
That Tammi's a peach.

155
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,994
Nah. Josh is after her. It's fine.

156
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,033
Real, man. You gonna let
your kid brother chew your grass?

157
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,037
I don't even know what that means.

158
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,470
He's been learning skills, mate.
Skills at the hands of the Bluemaster.

159
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,398
Oh, really?
So he knows how to talk shit now?

160
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,317
Mate, he's going to law school.

161
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,318
Euuurgh. It smells of boy!

162
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,590

- Yeah.

Just have to count to four, all right?

170
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,236
- (Marcus) Here we go!
- Just slip it in.

we're on the next flight home.

Blues, he's right. Be subtle about it.

You leave your balls in Customs?

177

- Don't worry.

178
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,399
We'll be back on the road shortly, OK?

179
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,036

- Guys, guys. Look relax, yeah?

180
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,391

We party on the high seas.

181

(Marcus) Don't worry about it.

- No man. You gotta hear it!

Nice and firm.

309
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,113
Oi!

310
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,916
(Sean) I was seeing someone
before we left, but it ended.

311
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,112
- (Tammi) Badly?
- She messed me about.

312
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,073
What about you?

313
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,079
Yeah, I was with someone
but people grow apart, don't they?

314
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,032
In fact, that's bollocks.

315
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,038
I caught him cheating
with a really old friend of mine.

316
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,479
That's horrible.

317
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,716
I felt like such a fucking idiot
for not realising...

318
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,792
No. He's the fucking idiot.

319
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,434
Wait a minute.

320
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,990
Them lot have all gone.

321
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,756
- Josh, too?
- All of 'em.

322
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,595
Leave him. He'll be all right.

323
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,636
(# BROADCAST: "Before We Begin")

324
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:06,348
# Here again, at the end,
before the beginning

325
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:14,311
# So the salt will spill again,
throw it over your shoulder... #

326
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,395
Oi, mate, make yourself useful.

327
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,120
Back up, back up.
Get us all in, man.

328
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,757
Slow... slow down...
better not come yet.

329
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,158
How about my boy here gets involved?

330
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,639
Oi, mate.

331
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,032
Come here.

332
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,797
You're up, bro. Break off a piece.

333
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,153
(Bluey) 'Harder, mate.
Harder. Fucking pound her.

334
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,758
'She loves it.

335
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,272
'Oi, mate, slap her arse.

00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,394
'She loves it.

00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,072
- 'Gonna come? '
- 'Yeah. Yeah.'

339
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,590
- 'You know what to do, yeah? '
- 'Yeah. Oh, fuck! '

340
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,755
'Do it. Do it.'

341
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,191
- Do it!
- Ah!

342
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,638
(Kim) Lisa? Lisa?

343
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,398
(Marcus) Lisa? Lisa?

344
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,753
(Hatch opens)

345
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,236
Did you get it over here?

346
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,314
Sean? W... will you come
downstairs please?

347
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,319
- Wish I could fucking find it.
- Let me.

348
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,316
- Mate, I think she's dead.
- (Kim) Oh, God... Lisa!

349
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,633
- Lise!
- No, Lise... Lisa.

350
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,318
What happened?

351
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,078
We were just...

352
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,194
She must have OD-ed.

353
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,634
Look, I'm calling it in.

354
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,320
- The coastguard can pick us up...
- Look, don't...

355
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,034
- (Tammi) Kim, come on.
- Don't.

356
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,798
Just... she's...

357
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,036
Th... they're not going to get here...
By the time they're here, we'll be gone.

358
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,957
There's no point.

359
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,991
(Engines start up)

360
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,793
We've just got to keep it together
and we'll be back, OK?

361
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,951
What the fuck, man?

362
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,436
- What have you done?
- Me? I haven't done anything.

363
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,510
Mate. I saw you.

364
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,279
Wh... what the fuck?

365
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,868
What did you do?

366
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,560
This fucking mong donkey-punched her.

367
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,239
No...

368
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,158
Sh... she OD-ed or she...
had an allergic reaction.

369
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,430
To what, my cock?

370
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,556
He donkey-punched her. For real.

371
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,519
I thought...

372
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,630
- You said...
- I didn't say shit, mate!

373
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,671
It was a joke, you dick.

374
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,555
A story. No one fucking does it,
you stupid fucking cunt.

375
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,189
- This is not fucking happening.
- (Bluey) No?

376
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,271
Check the replay.

377
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,559
(Kim) I just...

378
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,391
Bluey and Josh...

379
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,792
...acting weird.

380
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,198
Weird?

381
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,755
How do you mean weird?

382
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,990
They were shouting and...

383
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,039
...filming.

384
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,236
Bluey had a camera.

385
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,239
(Bluey on camera) 'Do it! '

386
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,077
We are in so much shit.

387
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,551
Did you call it in?

388
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,993
Your brother has something
he needs to tell you.

389
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,239
I erm...

390
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,716
I... I didn't mean to...

391
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,039
It's all right, babe, we're almost home.

392
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,797
Lisa OD-ed, babe.

393
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,311
It were an accident.

394
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,032
It weren't.

395
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,314
You have to help me.

396
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,719
Please.

397
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,508
(Sean) What the fuck are you doing?

398
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,198
(Engine dies)

399
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,119
(Marcus) We're all going down for this.
For a long time.

400
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,231
- We just explain...
- Explain?

401
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,432
There's a girl downstairs with a broken
neck, and our DNA's all over her!

402
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,551
Doesn't look good.

403
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,910
The best thing for all of us,

404
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,032
and especially your fucking stupid
prick of a brother, is if...

405
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,549
We could say she fell overboard.

406
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,316
No body. No case.

407
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,312
(Engine restarts)

408
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,953
What the fuck's going on?

409
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,230
It's all right.
I'm calling the police back home.

410
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,517
- 'Emergency response... '
- Shit!

411
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,677
What are we telling them?
What the fuck is going on?

412
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,279
(Voice crackles)

413
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,398
Can you hear me?

414
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,519
Listen to me!

415
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,393
(Signal breaks up)

416
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,274
I know it sounds callous...

417
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,197
The girls'll never agree to this.

418
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,629
Girls? Are you gay? They're lucky
we don't dump them, too.

419
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,320
Fuck is your problem?
It's your fault we're in this mess!

420
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,154
I'm the bad guy? I didn't snap
a girl's neck like a fucking twig.

421
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,989
You gave him the drugs, you fed him
those fucking fairy stories!

422
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,429
He's a big boy.
Didn't do anything he didn't want to.

423
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,758
Shut up. Shut your face.
Don't push your luck.

424
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,188
You're going to chuck that tape
and keep your mouth shut. All right?

425
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,357
(Bluey) All right, then. I'll get it.

426
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,709
- Throw the fucking thing!
- (Marcus) Bluey!

427
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,995
What about when we get back?
They'll just go straight to the police.

428
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,157
And say what?
"We were E'ed up, fucking these lads,

429
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,191
"but it weren't our fault."

430
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,518
We don't need their consent.
Not any more.

431
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,636
Someone needs to tell them.

432
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,278
(Tammi) Why aren't we going home?
(Marcus) We are.

433
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,039
- I'm not an idiot.
- Sit down.

434
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,954
Look, a really shit thing has happened
and everything's fucked.

435
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,119
Now, it's in everyone's best interests
that we do the right thing.

436
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,918
The right thing?

437
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,158
We just feel, like,
the best thing would be if we...

438
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,280
...bury Lisa at sea. Here. Now.

439
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,317
Why would you do that?

440
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,558
Because as far as the coastguard's
concerned, Lisa fell overboard.

441
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,436
You're all fucking mental.

442
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,673
Look, how long
have you actually known Lisa?

443
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,997
Do you want to be the one
who has to tell her parents

444
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,429
exactly what she was doing
when she died?

445
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,233
Look, I'm acting skipper of this ship.
I just want what's best for everyone.

446
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,076
We bury Lisa at sea.

447
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,474
We call it in,
when the coastguard comes,

448
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,513
we tell them she had too much to drink
and fell overboard. It happens.

449
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,631
But she didn't, did she?

450
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,750
You killed her. It's on that tape.

451
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,071
What tape?

452
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,998
Sean, you better tell them they can't.

453
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,588
Tell them. It's wrong.

454
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,678
- When they find the body, what then?
- They're not going to find the body.

455
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,389
(Marcus) The decision's been made.
This will all be over, very soon.

456
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,312
(Josh) Marcus?

457
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,394
We have to be in International Waters
before we do this.

458
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,239
This ship is registered in Panama,

459
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,989
so once we're over that line
in International Waters,

460
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,076
we're under Panamanian law.

461
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,514
If it ever went to court...
we'd be in Panama.

462
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,870
Shut up, Josh!

463
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,391
It's the most corrupt place on earth.
There's no way they'd convict.

464
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,512
We do it now.
We call it in after we cross the line.

465
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,871
- I just... you know... Sorry.
- We need to do this now.

466
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,116
While those girls are still scared.

467
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,639
(Sobbing)

468
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,392
All right, Kim.

469
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,593
No, please. Please, no...

470
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,148
Don't you dare touch her.

471
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,231
Don't you dare fucking touch her!

472
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,351
Now why don't you sit down?

473
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,589
I'm not asking. Sit.

474
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,237
I'm not your dog.

475
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,238
Good girl.

476
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,589
(Marcus) Josh, go and stop the boat.

477
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,431
Now!

478
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,594
Sean, get the anchor out of the RIB.

479
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,269
If we don't weigh her down,
she'll be ashore before we are.

480
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,037
This is not right.

481
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,032
Look. I've worked too fucking hard
to let your brother fuck it all up.

482
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,630
This way,
everyone gets their lives back.

483
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,833
Not everyone.

484
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,352
Oi!

485
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,511
- Get off!
- You killed her!

486
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,473
- That's what I'll say when we get out!
- Yeah? Go tell the police.

487
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,397
Tell them about the drugs
you were taking,

488
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,755
how you were fucking a stranger
when your friend died.

489
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,034
Shut up!

490
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,072
Cos you've got no tape, no body,
no proof of anything.

491
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,838
It's your word against ours.

492
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,953
Right! Tie them up!

493
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,672
Fuck you!

494
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,594
Leave her!

495
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,831
Go on. You fuckers,
I swear to God I'll cut you!

496
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,155
So you're going to cut me, yeah?

497
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,589
Bluey, hold her.
Fucksake, Sean, let's just do it now!

498
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,556
No! No!

499
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,590
Fucking bastards!

500
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:39,231
- Do you want to join her?
- Do you want to fucking join her?

501
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,794
How would you fucking like it?

502
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,434
Fuck!

503
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,075
- Marcus!
- (Sean) Go in there and find him!

504
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,589
- Quick.
- Where the fuck is he?

505
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,790
(Josh) Marcus!

506
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,679
(Signal crackles)

507
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,836
(Kim) Oh, fuck! How do you?

508
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,309
Whoa!

509
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:06,676
Don't you fucking touch her!

510
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,070
Josh, get back here and help me!

511
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,794
- Fucking trying to kill me!
- The girls moved the boat.

512
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,317
I almost got through.

513
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,670
Fuck that. There's a gun here.
We've got to find it.

514
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,839
No, we need to get flares or something.
Someone's got to be able to help us.

515
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,432
Kim!

516
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,310
Where the fuck are those girls?

517
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,317
(Bluey) Downstairs.

518
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,355
(Sean) Why? What are you going to do?

519
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,589
I'm going to go and have a hot shower.

520
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,558
You want to check whether that's OK
with our guests?

521
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,552
(Computer beeps)

522
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,352
(Engine revs up)

523
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,149
So you want to shoot me now?

524
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,833
We found Marcus.

525
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:31,037
Dead?

526
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,755
'Fraid not.
Here. Come on. It's freezing.

527
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,714
All this crazy shit is not helping.

528
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,195
- And what you're doing is really helpful?
- Look, you and me...

529
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,470
We're the only ones
with our heads screwed on.

530
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,319
You helped them throw Lisa!

531
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,398
You helped them throw her
like she were a...

532
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,351
Look, I just need...

533
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,598
...just need you
to keep Kim under control.

534
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,676
(Bluey) Fuck, man.

535
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,354
Marcus...

536
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,151
Thought we'd lost him.

537
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,233
Got to look out for each other.

538
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,713
Yes.

539
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,116
We're in the clear, right?

540
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,152
(Whispers) It's just their word
against ours?

541
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,594
Yeah.

542
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,712
Well, not quite...

543
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,071
Josh. What're you saying?

544
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,430
I dressed it up in legalese, but...

545
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,233
...basically it's all bullshit.

546
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,033
Wouldn't stand up in court.
The girl was off her face.

547
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,196
So there was no informed consent.

548
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,191
They'll say it was rape.

549
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,270
- But there's no body.
- Right.

550
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,437
Conspiracy to pervert
the course of justice.

551
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,114
Those girls get in front of a jury...

552
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,554
So, basically... we're fucked?

553
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,438
We're not.

554
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,559
Marcus is.

555
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:58,716
As acting skipper, anything that happens
aboard is... his responsibility.

556
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,431
He takes all the heat.

557
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,720
Legally, he's 100% liable.

558
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,235
Right word in the wrong ear...

559
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,716
(Bluey snorts)

560
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,514
You tricky little bastard.

561
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,278
What?

562
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,789
You think I'd shaft the 'coose?

563
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,229
- I'd never...
- Damn right.

564
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,397
Cos I've got a few tricks of my own.

565
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,156
Suck on that, bitch.

566
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,038
- Where's Sean?
- Dunno.

567
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,276
- Marcus wants you.
- What?

568
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,790
He's in the shower. Dropped the soap.
Needs some help picking it up.

569
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,551
(Josh) Think you can take the piss?

570
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,113
Sean. I need to...

571
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:50,311
Right, play time's over.
We've got 45 minutes left.

572
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,477
We reach the International Line,
we call it in.

573
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,712
Well, why aren't we going now?

574
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,673
Until that moment, everyone stays
right here where I can see them.

575
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,597
(Door latch clicks)

576
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,309
Why don't you fix us a meal?
I'm starving.

577
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,591
- Starvin' Marvin.
- You are joking.

578
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,030
That's about the only sensible
suggestion I've heard all evening.

579
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,991
Thank you, Marcus.

580
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,998
- (Marcus) You're tired...
- Fucking paranoid.

581
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,031
(Marcus) We need to get
some food inside us,

582
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,151
before any more accidents happen.

583
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,475
Right, then. Why don't we take a look
what's in the kitchen?

584
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,155
(Marcus) Watch them.

585
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,595
(Radar signal pulses)

586
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,590
Fuck, man. This all there is?

587
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,319
Josh?

588
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,273
You know what? This is really tasty.

589
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,155
So what's everyone doing
when we get back?

590
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,238
Reckon it's time for the Bluester
to move on.

591
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:48,432
Can't face Blighty. Quite fancy Goa.

592
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,633
Ever been?

593
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,156
- No.
- You should.

594
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,195
You're quite a goer yourself.

595
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,594
(Sniggers)

596
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,315
- Going home, Marcus?
- Am I fuck.

597
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,273
I've still got three months of freedom
before I get badged.

598
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,510
- Marcus...
- Not now Josh.

599
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,835
- (Josh) We've only got 20 minutes left.
- Leave it.

600
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,240
Bluey didn't chuck the tape.

601
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:31,473
He lied. He kept it.

602
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,030
Someone's got a big mouth.

603
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,479
Marcus, we had an understanding.

604
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,116
Yeah, well, understand this.

605
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,152
I'm not your brother's
get-out-of-jail free card.

606
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,679
What are you going to do with it?

607
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,679
First edit me and 'coose out, then post it
on the web. A pound a pop. Kerching!

608
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,360
- Bluey...
- Josh will be a YouTube superstar.

609
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:07,678
Don't wet your panties, Josh.
Stay in line, yeah?

610
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,478
You girlies wouldn't get out of line,
would you?

611
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,637
No, they're gonna say the right thing.
Aren't you?

612
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,034
Lisa always partied a bit too hard.

613
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,430
Everyone knew it.

614
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,835
So it was an accident?

615
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,115
She had too much to drink.

616
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,434
Went outside to clear her head.

617
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,720
That were the last that I saw of her.

618
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:53,315
- Marcus, I trusted you...
- Those two hate my guts, fair enough.

619
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,591
Now I've got your fucking little weasel of
a brother trying to turn Bluey against me.

620
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:00,309
Think I don't like all this fussing
and fighting. Why can't we all just?

621
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,399
- I'm warning you. Do not touch me.
- Come on. You girlies are so tense.

622
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,113
Let the Bluester work you
with his magic fingers.

623
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,117
Leave her alone.

624
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,038
I know what this is about.
She's jealous.

625
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,038
Kim gets all the attention.
You're too uptight.

626
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,832
That's why your boyfriend
shagged around.

627
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:21,078
- Wanker!
- Bet he shagged Kim, too, didn't he?

628
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,715
Oh...
I don't blame you sweetheart.

629
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,674
- I myself am a diagnosed sex addict.
- Yeah, well, try cold turkey!

630
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,155
Tried it, mate. Prefer hot pussy.

631
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,194
- (GPS beeps)
- Right. Let's do it.

632
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,517
No one calls it in until I have that tape.

633
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,029
- Sean, just call it!
- (Mimics) "Sean, just call it!"

634
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,798
Who cares?
We've got a beautiful boat...

635
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,752
- You promised!
...a bag full of drugs...

636
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,796
...two lovely ladies...
- (Sean) That's enough!

637
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,514
We could do it again.
You and Kim, a little double act?

638
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,232
- Email it to your ex?
- Bluey!

639
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,557
Show him what he's missing.
Come on, give us a kiss, huh?

640
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,432
Don't you fucking touch me!

641
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,479
(Whimpering)

642
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,509
Get it out... get it out of me!

643
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,756
Do not touch that knife!

644
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,718
(Sean) Marcus! Let go of her!
You're choking her!

645
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,557
Give me the Special K.
Give me the ketamine, man!

646
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,352
(Shouting)

647
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,833
- (Josh) Shall I give him Special K?
- Just give it to him for fucksake!

648
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,758
Here.

649
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,237
You're gonna be fine.

650
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,113
Your lungs are filling up with blood
but that's why God gave you two.

651
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,318
Tammi, open up!

652
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,715
Tammi, please open the door!
What the fuck is going on?

653
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:12,116
Josh, back up. Open the door!

654
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,474
Kim.

655
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,070
Kim, where's the fucking motor?

656
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,434
No! No!

657
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:17,473
(Sean) Where the hell are they?
We've got to find those girls!

658
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,272
Josh, where are they?

659
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:21,152
(Tammi) The flare.

660
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,671
(Shivering)

661
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,634
They've got that fucking tape, Tammi.

662
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,955
We can't prove nothing
without that tape.

663
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,231
- Well, do you wanna go and get it?
- No! Fuck that!

664
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:38,716
(Tammi) We'll have to find help.
Tell them what happened.

665
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,912
There has to be something in here.

666
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,554
Which of these flares? Red or blue?

667
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,477
Kim?

668
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:53,232
If we wait out here till tomorrow,
no one'll find us. We can die out here!

669
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,432
What are you doing?
They'll see us!

670
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:11,679
(Engine noise)

671
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,791
Oh, no, they've seen us.

672
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,669
Fucking seen us, ain't they?

673
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,590
(Engine stops)

674
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,509
(Sean) I'll throw you down the rope, OK?
Grab it.

675
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,552
(Kim) Fuck off.
We're not getting on your fucking boat!

676
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,636
- What are you doing?
- Kim, just...

677
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,556
(Sean) Hold on!

678
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,312
OK, I've got it.

679
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,196
Marcus!

680
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,268
- Get back on this fucking boat.
- Fuck you!

681
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,477
Get on the boat. Now!

682
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,309
If you don't get on this boat, I'm going
to shoot that thing from under you.

683
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,079
- Marcus, put it down.
- Back off!

684
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:38,038
- You fucking stabbed Bluey.
- He asked for it.

685
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,357
- Get on the boat.
- Back off or I swear to fucking God...!

686
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,150
Aaargh! Fuck!

687
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,793
(Screaming)

688
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:52,110
Aaargh! Fucking hell! Help!

689
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,196
Fucking help me, please!

690
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,631
Jump in the water!

691
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,112
It's alight in the fucking water!

692
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,151
Do something!

693
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,228
(Screaming)

694
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,590
(Josh) You shot him!
You fucking shot him!

695
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,431
(Girls sobbing)

696
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,671
(Door bangs open)

697
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,270
You. Stay here.

698
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,234
Fucking let us out!

699
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,713
(Muffled shouting)

700
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,354
Shit.

701
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,358
What the fuck's going on?

702
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:19,478
What the fuck have we done?

703
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,239
This is all your fault.

704
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,032
What?

705
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,071
You stabbed Bluey.

706
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,355
Got on a stupid dinghy.

707
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,596
Let the flare go.
The boys come back to us.

708
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,597
We wouldn't even be in Spain
if it weren't for you!

709
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,551
Shut up!

710
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,713
(Footsteps)

711
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,908
Oh, fuck.

712
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:55,917
Marcus is dead.

713
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,632
Yeah, I know.

714
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,830
But what are we gonna do?

715
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,837
Where the fuck are the keys?

716
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,155
- I... I don't...
- Look downstairs.

717
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,631
(Tammi) Sean! Let us out! Sean?

718
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,031
Fucking let us out!

719
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:47,437
Marcus must have had them.

720
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,278
Shit.

721
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,037
- Right, call it.
- And say what?

722
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:00,038
Call it! We need the Medevac now
or he will die.

723
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:03,197
Please, man... I don't wanna die.

724
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,116
OK. Yeah. I'll call it.

725
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,032
(Alarm beeping)

726
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,032
(Josh) Come on.

727
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,393
Come on.

728
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,437
There we go. I've got you.

729
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,472
I've got you.
There we go. You OK?

730
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,478
- (Bluey groans)
- Come on. I've got you.

731
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,793
There we go.

732
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,318
That's right.

733
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,272
Just through in the other room.
Just through here.

734
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,079
There we go.

735
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,793
Just here.

736
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,037
In you go. In here.

737
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,749
OK? I'm just going to sit you down,
all right?

738
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,750
We can chat in here. All right,
I've got you. All right? I've got you.

739
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,594
OK?

740
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,838
(Locks door)

741
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,672
(Sobbing)

742
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,436
I just need to know...

743
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,234
Where's the tape, Bluey?

744
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,432
My sister...

745
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:39,358
- I need to call my sister.
- OK. OK.

746
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,358
- Just tell me...
- I need to speak to her.

747
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,397
Where's the tape?

748
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,719
(Groans)

749
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,478
It's gonna fucking take forever.

750
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,238
(Bluey groans)

751
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,397
Oh, fuck it hurts. Give me K.

752
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,156
I need K.

753
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,351
(Muffled moans)

754
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,793
One of us is gonna
have to go at it, Kim.

755
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,552
You want me
to run through a glass door?

756
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,199
Babe?

757
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,311
You're heavier.

758
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:09,708
Oh, my God, Tam, you did it.

759
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,793
Are you OK?

760
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,719
- You want to find out if he's all right?
- I don't care about him. Are you OK?

761
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,470
No tape. No drugs.

762
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,116
(Door creaks)

763
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,838
(Bluey groans)

764
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,192
(Choking)

765
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,438
In the bedroom.

766
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,157
Under the bed.

767
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,032
Please.

768
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,559
Please...

769
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,752
(Josh) Fuck!

770
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,834
Oh, you prick.

771
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:15,796
You're 30 minutes from dying.
We're an hour from shore.

772
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,159
Mate, I told you...

773
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:51,793
Ah!

774
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,079
(Bluey) Ah!

775
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,279
Fuck!

776
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,359
I told you!

777
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,753
Fuck!

778
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,273
(Screams)

779
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,279
Fuck!

780
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,957
Fucking told you,
it's in the fucking bed...

781
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,277
- (Screams)
- Where the fuck is it? Where is it?

782
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,591
(Bluey screams)

783
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,433
Stupid, inbred fuckwit.

784
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,432
- Where is it?
- It's under the bed...

785
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,398
No. Stop it! Leave him alone!
He hasn't got it!

786
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,834
(Bluey screams)

787
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,153
(Drops knife)

788
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,271
Kim!

789
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,357
He's dead.

790
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,715
He was losing too much blood.

791
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,595
There's nothing I could have done.

792
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:15,034
Yeah. It's not my fault.

793
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,434
You liar.

794
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,559
The tape.

795
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,355
You knew he didn't have it.

796
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,551
Why aren't you taking us home?

797
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,676
I can't find the keys.

798
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,476
- (Cocks gun)
- (Kim) Get away from her.

799
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,070
Now back the fuck off.

800
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:58,399
(Tammi) He's got the keys.

801
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,119
Move.

802
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:04,631
Fucking move!

803
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,800
Get in there. Fucking move.

804
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,479
(Tammi) Kim.

805
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,352
Kim, give me that.

806
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,710
- Where is Sean?
- Shut up! Fucking take me home!

807
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:54,751
(Engine starts up)

808
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:02,073
(Engine revving higher)

809
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,031
Josh! What's going on?

810
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,834
Open the door!

811
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,473
- Call for help.
- I can't.

812
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:14,151
Sean reset the channels.
I don't know how.

813
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,032
Liar.

814
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:21,319
Where the fuck is he?

815
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,719
- He's with his precious engines, safe.
- Not when we're running...

816
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,478
- Liar!
- He'll die down there.

817
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,239
Open the door! Open the door!

818
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,670
Everything that comes
out of your mouth is a lie.

819
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,438
(Kim) Tammi!

820
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,271
You stay...

821
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:46,588
Have you thought about what you're
gonna say... when we get back?

822
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,594
Yeah. You're going to prison.

823
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,679
You, too.

824
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,358
Fuck you.

825
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,153
What I did... was an accident.

826
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,439
But you're both up for murder.

827
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:08,428
And if your friend goes to court
with that tape...

828
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,471
(Banging)

829
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,637
(Sean) Let me out, Josh, please!

830
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:19,231
Sean, you've got to help me.

831
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,952
You talk a load of shit.

832
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:24,277
I promise you,
you don't want that tape getting out.

833
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,679
- We can help each other.
- You want me to help you?

834
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:37,079
Listen. Marcus, Bluey and Lisa
were fooling around.

835
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:41,154
One of them killed Lisa.

836
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:45,478
Bluey argued with Marcus,
and they killed each other.

837
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,556
We stick to that story...

838
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,631
...clean the knife...

839
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,478
...dump the tape...

840
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,030
...and we all walk.

841
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,552
(Kim screams)

842
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,234
(Sobbing)

843
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,239
- Sean. Thank God.
- (Sean) What the fuck hap?

844
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:17,670
- What have you done to her?
- The crazy bitch was gonna kill me.

845
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,916
Josh, don't! What the fuck?

846
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,553
- She's got it.
- (Sean) What?

847
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:24,319
- (Tammi) Sean...
- Bluey's tape.

848
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,556
Just give it to me.

849
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:31,674
(Sean) Give me that gun, now.
I want that gun. Josh...

850
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:34,439
- Don't!
- Please don't make me do this.

851
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,120
- Josh. It's over!
- Get out of my way!

852
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:42,632
This is enough! Fuck!

853
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,473
(Sean) It's over!

854
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,555
It's over!

855
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:52,319
(Engine noise over dialogue)

856
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,433
(Motor starts)

857
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,754
(Screams)

858
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:09,634
(Motor dies)

859
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,032
(Josh) Oh, fuck!

860
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,918
Oh, fuck!

861
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,598
Sean! Sean!

862
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,438
(Tammi sobs)

863
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,076
(Josh) Sean. Sean.

864
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:29,792
Sean...

865
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,637
He had the gun.

866
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,589
He was gonna kill you...
He had a gun.

867
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,393
(Tammi) Kim!
(Josh) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...

868
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:00,111
(Tammi) What have you done?

869
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:02,754
He was trying to help us!

870
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,233
Kim...

871
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,559
Babe, don't!

872
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,355
Don't leave me here.

Kim, no!

876
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,836
They're dead.

877
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,032
They're all dead.

878
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,637
What are we gonna do?

879
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:24,153
Josh, we have to get off this thing,
cos if they find us here...

880
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:30,155
Come on. I am not staying here.

Hurry up.
