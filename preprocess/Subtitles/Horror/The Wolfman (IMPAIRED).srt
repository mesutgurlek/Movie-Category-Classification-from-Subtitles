but I think I would have
run him down with my dogs.

On the other hand,

218

that only something human

219

would seem capable
of such wanton malevolence.

220

I found a strange medallion
among Ben's belongings.

221
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:58,121
Yes, Saint Columbanus.
He was an Eastern saint.

222
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,260
He was also a gypsy.

223
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,728
So did Ben have dealings
with the gypsies?

224
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:10,607
Yes, he was our negotiator.

225
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,938
The local gentry
would pay a fee,

226

and the gypsies would keep
their criminal activities
to a minimum.

227
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:23,111
And they would move on
once they'd sold
the local lads all the wine

I was unable to lock myself
in the crypt that night.

(WHlSPERlNG) Gwen...

1130
01:50:30,572 --> 01:50:32,199
I'm sorry.

1131
01:50:34,042 --> 01:50:36,169
It had to be this way.

1132
01:50:38,713 --> 01:50:40,340
I'm sorry.

1133

Thank you.

GWEN: It is said
there is no sin
in killing a beast,

1136
01:51:46,347 --> 01:51:48,542
only in killing a man.

1137
01:51:53,321 --> 01:51:56,722
But where does one begin
and the other end?
