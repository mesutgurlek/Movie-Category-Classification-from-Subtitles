RAMIREZ:
When I was a child,

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,860
my mother would
tell me a story

3
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,233
about how
the Devil roams the Earth.

4
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,705
Sometimes, she said,
he would take human form

5
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:20,337
so he could punish the damned on
Earth before claiming their souls.

6
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,944
The ones he chose
would be gathered together

7
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:29,921
and tortured as he hid amongst
them, pretending to be one of them.

8
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,757
I always believed my mother
was telling me an old wives' tale.

9
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,147
My mother's story would
always begin the same way,

10
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:39,217
with a suicide paving the
way for the Devil's arrival.

11
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:47,052
And it would always end with
the deaths of all those trapped.

It's important.

21
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,362
Your ability to forgive
is gonna determine

22
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,925
the quality of the rest of your
life more than anything else.

23
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,005
Look, some things
are beyond forgiveness.

24
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,741
You're already
on your way.

25
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,470
You've taken responsibility
for your actions.

26
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,512
That's more than half
the battle right there.

27
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,504
But to truly feel free,

28
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,579
you may need to
finally start believing

29
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,587
in something
greater than yourself.

30
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,452

But when I think about the
guy that killed my family,

33
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,794
I have a tough time believing
in much of anything.

34
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,835
I'm just saying,
leave yourself open to it.

00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,900
I think someone pulled my blouse.
I'm... I'm...

322
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,080
OLD WOMAN: You're bleeding.
TONY: Here. Here. Stand up.

323
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,011
Let me help you.

324
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,584
I think I got cut.

325
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,356
What's going on
in there?

326
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,359
I don't know.
They're just scared.

327
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,728
I think
that lady got hurt.

328
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,788
LUSTIG: Did she?

329
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,293
Yeah, see that?

330
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,434
OLD WOMAN:
What in the world?

331
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,199
TONY: Oh, my God.

332
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,576
What's he saying?

333
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,941
I can't tell
what he's saying.

334
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,177
I can't tell what
you're trying to say.

335
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,315
Turn off the...
Turn off the music!

336
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,221
Maybe they don't
like the music.

337
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,157
The music's still on?
Yeah.

338
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,422
Turn it off.
It's probably driving them nuts.

339
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,393
Okay. How?

340
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:56,193
There's a kill switch
right behind the...

341
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,701
Right under the key box.

342
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,300
(MUSIC STOPS)

343
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:06,875
Thank you!

344
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,173
LUSTIG:
What happened to her?

345
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,281
It feels like
something bit me.

346
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,512
TONY: Wait, wait. Does anybody
have anything sharp on them

347
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,713
that might have cut her,

348
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,653
she might have cut herself on?
OLD WOMAN: No.

349
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,257
Why you got
blood on you, man?

350
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:27,990
She fell into me.

351
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,090
OLD WOMAN:
So you cut her?

352
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,397
What? No. No, something
must have happened to her

353
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,960
and then she fell into me.

354
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,467
She probably
did it to herself!

355
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,938
TONY: Come on!
BEN: Bit her own back?

356
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,901
OLD WOMAN:
You think this is a bite?

357
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,034
TONY: No, nobody got bit.

358
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,702
What else could
have done that?

359
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:42,040
I'll tell you.
OLD WOMAN: I don't know.

360
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,546
A serrated blade
could have.

361
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,207
You wouldn't happen
to have a knife with

362
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,807
a serrated blade
on you, would you?

363
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,011
No.

364
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,520
TONY: Okay.
You mind if we search your pockets?

365
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,250
Yes, I do mind.
You mind if we search yours?

366
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,485
Go right ahead.

367
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,025
Maybe she has
a serrated blade on her!

368
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,754
Are you seriously suggesting
that I would do this to myself?

369
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,854
I don't know.

370
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,126
Give me another reason
to kick your ass.

371
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,259
Please, bro,
take it easy, okay?

372
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,561
BEN: Bro?

373
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,971
I'm not your bro.

374
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,203
Can you turn
towards the camera

375
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,371
and show us what
happened to you, please?

376
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,314
Oh, my God.
Whoa!

377
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,449
Okay, we gotta
call the police.

378

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

379
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:45,006
MALE POLICE DISPATCHER:
We have a possible 240
at 333 Locust Street.

380
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,377
333 Locust?
That's gotta be right around...

381
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:52,976
...here.

382
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,012
Strange.

383
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,749
602 responding. Happen to
be right outside. Put me on it.

384
00:25:58,823 --> 00:25:59,915
FEMALE POLICE DISPATCHER:
Copy that, 602.

385
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,322
That's convenient.

386
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,290
I don't make the calls,
they just come for me.

387
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:05,590
Go.

388
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,793
Markowitz!

389
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,568
Hey, how's
your girlfriend?

390
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:14,900
Shut up.

(LAUGHING)

392
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,639
What are you doing?

393
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,909
I thought I saw something.

394
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,613
What do you mean?
Like what?

395
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:29,817
Something.

396
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,756
Okay.
You see it?

397
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,057
Yeah, yeah.
Look, that's just...

398
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,231
That's just
grain in the image.

399
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,665
That's, you know...
It's a mistake.

400
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,033
It's like when people see Jesus
in a pancake or something.

401
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,867
No. No. No.

freaking me out. Come on.

(MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY)

Hey, hey.
Hey, listen to me.

406
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,312
We need to convey calm.
These people are relying on us, okay?

407
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,290
So stop this shit
right now.

408
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,123
Come on.

409
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,197
Come on!

410
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,673
TONY: I don't even know
why we're trying this.

411
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,944
We're in the express shaft.

412
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,250
There's not gonna be another
opening till the 23rd floor.

413
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,812
Maybe we're close.

OLD WOMAN:
Could this elevator fall?

415
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:41,149
TONY: I doubt it.

416
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:45,093
Because we gotta be 20 floors up,
just dangling over nothing.

417
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,661
Can we stop talking
about this, please?

418
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:50,794
One more time.

419
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,101
On three. One...

420

Oh, no, no, no.

421
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,604
Stay away from me, man.

422
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,666
I can help. I want to
get out of here, too.

423
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:02,873
Why don't you sit your creepy ass
down in the corner over there?

424
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,612
We can all
keep an eye on you.

425
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,986
Are you ready? On three.

426
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,182

427
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,347
Three.

428

I'm just over here.

429
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,398
And why do you think
this might be an assault?

430
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:27,062
She seemed to be having words
with one of the other passengers

just before it happened,

00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,930

all keeping an eye on him.

Which guy?
That guy, right there.

434
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,135
Do we have communication?

435
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,505
Yeah, we have
an open line here.

436
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,842
You can talk,
but we can't hear.

Bowden, Philadelphia P.D.

We're working hard to get you out
of there. Shouldn't be much longer.

00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,725
Please just remain calm.

440
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,160
How soon till we get in?

441
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,661
Engineer's
working on it now.

442
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,630
Usually, we get these
things going pretty quick.

443
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,765
This engineer work for you
guys or the elevator company?

444
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:56,858
Works for us.

445
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,230
Okay.
Call the elevator company

446
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,827
and have them
send someone, okay?

447
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,667
And have the Fire Department
send some guys.

448
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,968
You got it.

449
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,470
At least one of your staff is aboard.

450
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,771
LUSTIG: Oh, yeah, the guard there,
he's a temp, actually.

451
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,313
Ben something. I don't know.
He started yesterday.

452
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:13,839
Okay. Call the temp agency and
get all the info they have on him.

453
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,913
And the others?

454
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,614
We don't have names
for the others.

455
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,050
What?
He should see the face.

456
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,482
LUSTIG: No.
What face?

457
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,219
No. Nothing.
I saw a face.

458
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,255
Look, there's no face.
Tell him about the face.

459
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,856
No. Look, Ramirez is kind of religious.
Just ignore him. Trust me.

460
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,467
I'd like to get a sense
of who you all are.

461
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,069
Stop it right now,
comprende?

462
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,027
One at a time,
I'd like you to hold up

463
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,572
your driver's license
to the camera

464
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,301
so I know who
I'm talking to.

465
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,138
That's a good idea.

466
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,268
Thank you.

467
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:41,736
Yeah.

468
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,942
Try and get it
closer to the camera.

469
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,884
The letters are too small.

470
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,449
Is there a sharpness
setting on this thing?

471
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,059
No, that's as good as
it gets, right there.

472
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,753
You can put your ID's away.
Thanks.

473
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,691
Do any of you
have a pen on you?

474
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,127
No one?

475
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,506
Here you go.

476
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,507
I want you to account for
everyone on the visitors' log.

477
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,641
Find out which
of these people

478
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:20,843
didn't show up
for their appointment.

479

Hey.

have you seen a child fall

that they hit it?

might be the Devil.

they come back up,

between
the camera and the body

551
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,350

you're stuck in there,

do as little damage to it

got it?

they can't control themselves.

but they don't look murderous.

564

to help me out.

hanging out of his pocket.

it out and hold it up to the camera.

You see some things
you wish you hadn't.

578
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,321
Wait, so you've been
trained to kill people?

Can you take a look at this suicide

but then it ends with, "I can hear
the Devil's footsteps draw near."

stretch around the block.

The guy was a real scumbag.

610

Three years ago, he started
one of those Ponzi schemes

and when it collapsed,
a lot of people lost their asses.

killed himself over it.

There's a good chance one
of our people didn't sign in.

How's that?

might be on this list.

623

What's this?

624
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:50,186
Our victim lost a lot of
people a lot of money.

These are the ones
that filed complaints.

626
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,653
The killer's probably smart
enough not to be on both lists.

Look for the one
that didn't sign in.

Did you just want video
of the guy who died,

or also the girl
that got hurt?

636
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:16,112
even guys like you
who pretend they don't.

637
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:32,860
What's this?

638
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,491
BOWDEN: An apology note
left at the site of a hit-and-run.

639
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,100
My wife and son were killed down
on Bethlehem Pike five years ago,

640
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:49,938
but that's okay,
because whoever did it is sorry.

641
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,280
You can tell
by the heartfelt apology

642
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,147
on the back of
a car wash coupon.

643
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,253
So, no, I don't believe in the Devil.
We don't need him.

644
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:01,089
People are bad enough
by themselves.

645
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,057
Stop the tape.

646
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,123
Back it up.

647
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,963
Faster, faster.

648
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,033
There. Now, play it.

649
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,603
She was acting
like he grabbed her.

650
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:18,875
What is she up to?

651
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,312
Folks, do me a favor,
keep your hands off each other.

652
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,282
Leave the police work to me.
I'll be in there any moment.

653
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:29,718
Won't I?

654
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,739
Stop it.

655
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,370
I don't like him touching me.
He's touching me.

656
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,709
I don't like it!

657
00:41:58,782 --> 00:41:59,908
Stop pushing him onto me.

658
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,445
Stand back.

659
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:02,746
Hell, no.
I know you're not doing

660
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,117
what it looks
like you're doing!

661
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,815
Spray that in here,
you're gonna blind all of us.

662
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:07,220
I'll do it. TONY: Seriously,
put it down.

663
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,349
Lady...

664
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:19,369
Dwight, where are you? You gotta
stop disappearing, seriously.

665
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,563
Dwight.

666
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,831
Hang on a sec.

667
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:26,435
Dwight, you gotta get us in that
car right now. Where are you?

668
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,840
I can't.

669
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,410
Dwight, I need you to stay on walkie!

670
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:33,780
Man...

671
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,079
(SCREAMING)

672
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,285
Can you see this?
Huh? You see this?

673
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:49,965
"Use by October 21, 1987."

674
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,433
TONY:
She was scared. Relax.

675
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,464
She tried to
pepper spray me, man!

676
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,166
(RUMBLING)

677
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,837
LUSTIG: (OVER RADIO)
Dwight, where are you?

678
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,772
We're being saved.

679
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,545
Dwight, where are you?

680
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,682
Come on, pick up.
Pick up!

681
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,052
BOWDEN: They hear something.

682
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:17,092
They hear your guy
moving in the shaft.

683
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,292
Then how come
he's not answering?

684
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,589
LUSTIG: Dwight? Dwight, this is
serious. You need to pick up, Dwight.

685
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,193
Thank you!

686
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,901
Pick up, Dwight. Pick up.

687
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:34,870
TONY: Oh, no.

688
00:43:35,913 --> 00:43:39,713
No, no. Hey! Hey!
Hey! Oh, no. Hey!

689
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,747
Hey! You all right?

690
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,352
Hey!
Come on.

691
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:50,492
TONY: Come on! Hey!

692
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,884
LUSTIG: Dwight, where the
hell are you, man? Come on!

693
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,883
What floor did Dwight
enter the shaft from?

694
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,785
He entered from the roof.

695
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:23,924
What are they looking at?

696
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,593
Dwight. Dwight, pick up.

697
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:55,488
Looks like he fell. He's impaled
right on top of the elevator.

698
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,390
Hurt real bad.
Possibly dead.

699
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,934
MARKOWITZ: Hey, Bowden,
I think the people in the elevator

700
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,902
can hear our radios.

701
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,330
Yeah, that's confirmed.

702
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,834
BOWDEN: Can you switch
to channel eight?

703
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:16,303
The car's stuck on 21.

704
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,472
Markowitz, tell the Fire
Department looks like they have to

705
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,608
go through the wall on 21.

706
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,910
This is Lustig.
You can't just go through the wall.

707
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:24,976
Sure we can.

708
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,287
That's why you
have insurance.

709
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,789
MARKOWITZ: Fire command,
go to eight, please.

710
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,326
BOWDEN: There she is.

711
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,426
MARKOWITZ: Sarah Caraway.

712
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,664
We know the security temp
is Benjamin Larson

713
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,763
and we know McCormick.

714
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,705
What other names
are unaccounted for?

715
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:49,709
Jane something. Looks like "Kowski."
The older woman.

716
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,744
Find me footage
of this guy.

717
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,877
This way, ma'am.

718
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,052
CAPTAIN: Let's go.
FIREMAN: All clear.

719
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,357
BOWDEN:
Okay, this time slow.

720
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:13,867
You gotta be kidding me.

721
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,199
Did she just steal
that lady's wallet?

722
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:18,364
So Vince was a scam artist,
this woman Jane's a thief,

723
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,942
Sarah there is a liar
and our guard is a thug.

724
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,303
Quite the crew
we have here.

725
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,612
I still haven't
seen this guy here.

726
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:32,644
What was that?

727
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,555
It's okay.
Hard drive crash.

728
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:35,955
I got it.
Number 2.

729
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,187
Here we go.

730
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,391
Any other angle
on the lobby?

731
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,630
LUSTIG:
Just the main entrance.

732
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:48,897
There.

733
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,873
Okay, rewind back.

734
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,172
Faster.

735
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,570
There he is. Stop it.

736
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:05,453
Where's that satchel?

737
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,324
He doesn't...
There's no satchel in the elevator.

738
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,860
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

739
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:21,234
BOWDEN: Shit.

740
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:23,801
Oh, no.

741
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,505
MARKOWITZ: What's happening?

742
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,405
I can't take this anymore!

743
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,379
Don't come near me,
any of you!

744
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,449
TONY: Maybe, if I could
just check the wiring...

745
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:39,818

Please turn on the light.

751
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,307
Turn on the lights!

(SARAH SCREAMING)

754
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,399
That's it.
Shut down the building.

755
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,530
Bring everyone
down to the lobby.

756
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,298
Nobody comes
in or out but us.

757
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,671
Which guy do you think
is doing this?

758
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,075
BOWDEN: There are three people
in there and they're all capable.

759
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:36,742
Well, she's not doing it.

760
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,048
I'm ruling nobody out.

761
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,217
Fire Department wants to know
if you have a shut-off valve

762
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,014
before they get through the wall,
just in case.

763
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,620
Yeah, it's
in the basement.

764
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,457
I'll go.

765
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,692
RAMIREZ: They're bad people,
that's why they're here.

766
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,964
No, two of them are here because
they just got on the wrong elevator.

767
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:02,096
Yeah, and I just happened
to have the wrong job

768
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:04,299
and you just happened to
take the wrong call.

769
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,739
He never
does this in secret.

770
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,916
There's a reason
we're the audience.

771
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,323
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.

772
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:27,997
No one's getting in
this building right now.

773
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,430
I know. I'm supposed to
meet somebody upstairs.

774
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:31,490
You're gonna have to call them
and tell them you can't make it.

775
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,001
Can you just tell me
what's happening?

776
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,038
RAMIREZ: He always
kills the last victim

777
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,005
in front of
the person they love most

778
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,340
to make cynics of us all.

779
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,171
No, no, no.
Don't touch her.

780
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:43,803
I'm not gonna leave her
just hanging there.

781
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,173
Where you gonna put her?

782
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,909
I haven't
thought that far ahead.

783
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,654
Funny how all this
stuff starts happening

784
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,455
right after you
start working here.

785
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,019
Seems to me,
you're the only one

786
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,531
who knew where
the cables are.

787
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,538
What are you doing?

788
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,817
Trying to
close her eyes.

789
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:29,183
That doesn't work,
not until they're dead for a few hours.

790
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:37,994
Okay, you enter the
building with a satchel.

791
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:40,502
You see a sign-in desk you
wanna avoid. Where do you go?

792
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,473
Restroom.
Yep.

793
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:57,981
Got it.

794
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,460
Could those be used
to rig an elevator?

795
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:19,434
I have no idea, but he doesn't
sign in and then he hides these?

796
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,063
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

797
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,350
What the hell is that?

798
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,853
I wish he'd stop.

799
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,090
I don't even know your name.

800
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,837
I'm Ben.

801
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,298
I'm Sarah.

802
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,942
I'm Tony.

803
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,752
TONY: So where'd your
claustrophobia go?

804
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:46,887
BEN: Excuse me?

805
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:53,459
I've never seen claustrophobia
come and go like that.

806
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:57,463
You trying to say something?
Then say it. Yeah, yeah.

807
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:58,973
Okay, I'm saying
I didn't do this,

808
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:00,873
and I very much doubt that she did,
so that leaves you.

809
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:04,270
I'm saying I think this
claustrophobia thing...

810
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:07,144
I think it's an act.

811
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,875
Yeah, I'm saying
I think you're a liar.

812
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:16,182
(YELLING)

813
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:23,627
Kill him, Ben!

814
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,727
Kill him
before he kills us!

815
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,097
Kill him!

816
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:34,866
Stop it! Stop!

817
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,980
Stop it! Get us out!
Get us out! Get us out!

818
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:44,284
Back away from each other now!
Get off!

819
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,288
We're gonna keep you safe
and here's how,

820
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:50,087
everyone get to a corner and
place your hands on the wall

821
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,889
so everyone can see that
you're not up to anything.

822
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,556
Go ahead. Do it!

823
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,191
You won't have to
keep this up long.

824
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,169
The building is
surrounded by police.

825
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,981
In a hypothetical conversation
that I'm not really having,

826
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,180
how would this
story of yours end?

827
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,145
They all die.

828
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:22,722
That's it?

829
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:25,387
Yeah.

830
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,928
This is not
your fault.

831
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,091
They made the choices
that brought them here.

832
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,306
Hey.
You're gonna love this.

833
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:38,671
What have you got?

834
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,073
She has
a criminal record, too.

835
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,202
Three counts of blackmailing
rich married men.

836
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,542
Now where this
gets interesting,

837
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,048
is couple of years ago,
the arrests stopped. Guess why.

838
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,141
Tell me.

839
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:49,879
Well, her name is
Sarah Caraway.

840
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,615
"Caraway" Caraway?

841
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:52,950
Yeah.
She married into the family.

842
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:54,183
So she shoplifted an heir.

843
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:55,349
Yeah, something
like that, I guess.

844
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,052
What's she doing here?

845
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,389
According to
the sign-in sheet,

846
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,897
she was gonna see a lawyer
on 42 named Wayne Kazan.

847
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,700
Excuse me. Excuse me.

848
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:09,633
Hey, listen up!
Quiet down! Quiet down!

849
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:10,866
(CROWD CONTINUES CHATTERING)

850
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,271
Hey, quiet!

851
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,800
Philadelphia P. D!

852
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,437
I'm looking for
a Wayne Kazan.

853
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,038
Is there a Wayne Kazan
down here?

854
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:20,776
Yeah.

855
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,078
Excuse me.

856
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,582
Heads up. Did you have a meeting
today with a Sarah Caraway?

857
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:27,817
I don't know.
Do you have a subpoena?

858
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,586
Come on,
you can tell me that much.

859
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,417
I might have. Why?

860
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:34,461
She was attacked.
Who has motive to hurt her?

861
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:36,290
Well, you know I can't
divulge personal information.

862
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:37,492
Come on, man.
Give me something.

863
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:38,659
Give me something
to work with here.

864
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:40,066
I'm trying to save
your client's life.

865
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,538
Come here.

866
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,307
I guess I'd do what
you guys normally do

867
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,208
and start with
the person closest to her.

868
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,245
Thanks.
And just so you know,

869
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,146
my specialty is
forensic accounting.

870
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,820
Markowitz, get Mrs.
Caraway's husband on the phone.

871
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,753
Should be okay now.

872
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,767
All right, get in there.

873
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,277
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

874
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:39,560
LUSTIG: I might have found
the problem. It's a bad wire.

875
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:42,029
Looks like it could be
shorting out the circuits.

876
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:03,274
Okay.

877
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,423
Easy. Easy.

878
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,953
That's it.

879
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,011
Yeah, I'm fine.

880
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:34,714
Vasquez, we're gonna need
the large Target saw up here

881
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:35,773
as fast as you can bring it.

882
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,993
MARKOWITZ: Look, we need
two more on 21, okay, guys?

883
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,926
Any luck getting
hold of the husband?

884
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:47,985
No, not yet.

885
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:50,498
I called his office and his secretary
said he'd call me right back.

886
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:51,625
(CROWD SCREAMING)

Back up! Heads up,
heads up! Come on!

888
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,000
Heads up! Back up!

889
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:00,440
Move out of the way!
Get away! Back up!

890
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,273
What happened?
Anybody see what happened?

891
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:03,334
Medic!

MAN:
He came through the door.

893
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,706
Breathe. Breathe.

00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:08,480

895

Back away!
Back away! Move back!

896
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,548
Get everybody back.
Back away!

897
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,075
Put your hands
back on the wall.

898
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,370
It hurts.

899
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:42,082
Put your hands
back up on that wall.

900
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:46,850
Or what?

901
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:52,554
Just leave her alone.
She's in pain.

902
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:55,059
Don't you see
what she's doing?

903
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,860
Chick's a twist.

904
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,662
What are you talking about?

905
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:02,728
Yeah, that's what we used to call
people like her in the Marines.

906
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,768
Suddenly out of the blue, everybody
would start fighting with each other.

907
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,276
Tempers would flare,
people would start getting hurt.

908
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:13,543
But then we realized
it's just the new guy

909
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,343
telling everybody
what other people said,

910
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:18,717
stirring shit up
where there wasn't any.

911
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:24,817
Until one night when we beat
the living shit out of that twist.

912
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:29,627
And then, just like that,

913
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,969
everything would
go back to normal.

914
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:37,970
Are you threatening me?

915
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:40,934
I just want you to know
that I know.

916
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,339
Why don't you just shut up and
keep your hands on the wall?

917
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,500
MARKOWITZ: (OVER RADIO) Sarah
Caraway's husband won't talk to us.

918
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:05,591
He lawyered up.

919
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:08,296
Her lawyer told me
she's locating all his money.

920
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:10,799
I bet she's about to leave
him and he might know it.

921
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,937
That would definitely
give him motive to kill her.

922
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:14,435
But if he's trying
to kill his wife,

923
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,171
why are Jane Kowski
and Vince McCormick dead?

924
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,507
This is Matt with
Caraway Security.

925
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:19,176
I need someone
from maintenance

926
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,476
to come down and
shut the bay doors.

927
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:26,715
Sarah Caraway's husband doesn't
own Caraway Security, does he?

928
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,155
Meet me in the office!

929
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,064
He's not done yet.

930
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,694
It's the Kensington sniper
all over again.

931

RAMIREZ:
What's a Kensington sniper?

932
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,768
A few years ago, a guy shot four
strangers and then his own wife,

933
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:49,778
trying to make a personal
killing look like a serial.

934
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:52,076
The guard works
for the woman's husband.

935
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,740
I think the two victims
were just a decoy.

936
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,908
The guard is
gonna kill her.

937
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:56,177
I need to be in that
elevator right now!

938
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:57,583
Move!
Right.

939
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,614
Please don't let him
kill me, Ben.

01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,746
Oh, my God. It is you.

953
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:10,582
Please, lady.

954
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:14,288
They can't hear you.
You don't have to pretend anymore.

955
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,564
We both know who did this.

956
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,895
Yeah, we do.

957
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,943
BOWDEN: Put down the glass and
get your hands on the wall now!

958
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:36,378
I should kill you
right now.

959
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,477
I should kill you right now
before you try anything else.

960
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:39,851
I should cut you right now.

961
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,584
And what'll be
your defense? Huh?

962
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:45,957
"She killed them all,
so I had to kill her"?

963
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:48,189
Yeah, something like that.

964
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:50,297
You take me down,

965
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:55,034
they're pinning all of this
on you and you know it.

966
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:58,963
A big,
tough guy like yourself.

967
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:02,944
RAMIREZ:
This is what he does.

968
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:05,180
He wants us to
doubt everything.

969
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:06,676
Markowitz.

970
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,081
Markowitz?
We're getting close, boss.

971
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:12,454
Hurry up!

972
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:14,389
How would I do it?

973
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,122
Do what?

974
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:21,089
According to your story,
how would I save them?

975
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,032
There's no easy answer.

976
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:28,233
You're never
gonna get these people

977
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,202
to see themselves
as they really are

978
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,400
'cause it's the lies
that we tell ourselves,

979
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:35,540
they introduce us to him.

980
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:48,954
Look at what you're doing.

981
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,256
Don't think
just because I'm a cop

982
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,454
I don't know what you're
going through right now.

983
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,290
I've been to hell.

984
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:04,203
Six months ago, I...

985
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:10,804
...checked into a hotel and I
nearly drank myself to death.

986
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:15,217
The thing is,
when you're self-destructing,

987
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:17,309
it looks like
it's the world's fault.

988
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:20,844
Like you're dealt a series of
shit hands, but that's not real.

989
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:24,590
Okay? It was all on me.
All of it.

990
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:28,822
I realized my only way out of
hell was to take responsibility

991
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,422
for what I had become.

992
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:35,434
You are responsible for this.

993
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:36,933
You realize that,
don't you?

994
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,497
Take responsibility
for what you're doing.

995
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:43,369
Put down the glass.

996
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:48,076
Put down the glass.

997
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:58,058
I'll put this down
if you do, too.

998
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,362
Okay?

999
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:03,595
We'll call a truce.

1000
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,519
BOWDEN: Good.

1001
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:32,122
You're doing the right thing.

1002
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:38,723
Sir, we found a woman who thinks
she knows someone in the elevator.

1003
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:40,466
Send her in.

1004
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:43,430
No.

1005
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,831
Get in there!
Get in there! Now!

1006
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,107
FIREMAN: We're through!

1007
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:52,806
(SCREAMING)

1008
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:19,235
(WHEEZING)

1009
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,314
CHOl: This is the woman
I was telling you...

1010
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:34,923
BOWDEN: Hold her outside!

1011
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,117
Tony.

1012
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:37,620
(SARAH WHEEZING)

1013
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:39,918
You know him?

1014
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:43,062
He's my fianc.
He had a job interview here today

1015
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,156
and he didn't want to
bring his tools in with him.

1016
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:46,223
I was late picking them up.

1017
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:47,461
Tony what?

1018
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:48,969
Janekowski.
Tony Janekowski.

1019
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:57,203
Jane Kowski is Janekowski?

1020
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,815
He signed in.
Then who is...

1021
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,549
Come on, breathe.
Right there. Come on, breathe.

1022
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:08,016
Breathe! Come on,
come on. Please breathe.

1023
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:09,315
(EXCLAIMING)

1024
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,521
(EXCLAIMING IN SPANISH)

1025
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:13,323
It's her! It's her.

1026
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:16,895
Get in there already.

1027
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,031
Who are you?
OLD WOMAN: Today?

1028
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,336
I'm an old woman.

1029
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,265
Grab her
the moment you get in.

1030
01:07:26,842 --> 01:07:30,209
Are you ready for
your turn, Anthony?

1031
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:31,301
(WHEEZING)

1032
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,134
(CAR ENGINE STARTING UP)

1033
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,320
TONY: I'm sorry.

1034
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:23,658
I'm sorry.

1035
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:26,259
The whores, the liars,
the cheats and the deserters,

1036
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,057
it's always the same thing.

1037
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:30,995
You know who I am now.

1038
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:32,598
Yes?

1039
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:36,996
Take me.

1040
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:38,096
OLD WOMAN:
I intend to.

1041
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:41,974
No, take me instead.
I deserve this.

1042
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,111
You don't
believe that.

1043
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:46,738
Yes. Yeah, I do.

1044
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:49,909
I should never have left.

1045
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,647
It's my fault.
It's all my fault.

1046
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:54,951
You think you can make
some kind of bargain?

1047
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:56,982
Take me instead. Please.

1048
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,115
Stop saying that!

1049
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:16,404
You think this will
make you good?

1050
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:17,807
You're not good.

1051
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:19,173
I know.

1052
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:21,282
You think you can make up
for the choices you made?

1053
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:23,745
No.

1054
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:26,982
You think you can
be forgiven?

1055
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:28,517
No.

1056
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:31,081
Channel eight.

1057
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:35,253
I killed a mother and her son
on Bethlehem Pike

1058
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:36,696
five years ago.

1059
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,058
Uh.

1060
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:42,501
It was a hit-and-run
and I was never caught.

1061
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,368
I'm so sorry.

1062
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,728
(SARAH WHEEZING)

1063
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:17,361
TONY: No.

1064
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,380
Damn.

1065
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:36,586
I really wanted you.

1066
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,042
BOWDEN:
Come on, come on, come on!

1067
01:12:13,062 --> 01:12:14,393
Where is she?

1068
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:16,925
Where'd she go?

1069
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:27,572
(INAUDIBLE)

1070
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,321
(EXHALES)

1071
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,660
I'll take him in.

1072
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:14,539
That was my family
on Bethlehem Pike.

1073
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,181
That was my son.

1074
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,430
I've been waiting for this
moment for five years.

1075
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:35,766
All the things
I'd say to you

1076
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,671
and what I'd do.

1077
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:47,571
The thing is...

1078
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:54,880
...I forgive you.

1079
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:05,593
RAMIREZ: 
After my mother would finish her story, 
she would always comfort us.

1080
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,428
"Don't worry," she'd say.

1081
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:14,173
"If the Devil is real,
then God must be real, too."
