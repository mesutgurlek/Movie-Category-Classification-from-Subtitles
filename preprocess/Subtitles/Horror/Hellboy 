1
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,288
<i>What is it that makes a man a man?</i>

2
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,087
<i>Is it his origins,
the way things start?</i>

3
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,429
<i>Or is it something else,
something harder to describe?</i>

4
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,331
<i>For me, it all began in 1944.</i>

5
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,738
<i>Classified mission
off the coast of Scotland.</i>

6
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,303
<i>The Nazis were desperate.</i>

7
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,948
<i>Combining science and black magic...</i>

8
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,517
<i>...they intended to upset
the balance of the war.</i>

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,153
<i>I was 28, already a paranormal
advisor to President Roosevelt.</i>

10
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:36,885
<i>I could never have suspected
that what would transpire that night...</i>

11
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:40,089
<i>...would not only affect
the course of history...</i>

12
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,962
<i>...but change my life forever.</i>

13
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,694
All right, men, let's go. Move!

14
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,873
Come on! Come on! Come on!

15
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,175
Let's fan it out.

16
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,686
Your men...

17
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,790
...they'll need these.

18
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,025
Are you a Catholic?

19
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,631
Yes. Among other things.
But that's hardly the point.

20
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,664
Well, you're gonna need
one of these.

21
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,230
I abhor the use of violence.

22
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,069
Thank you. I wouldn't want you
to think me mad, Sergeant Whitman.

23
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,801
No, three days too late for that,
Professor Broom.

24
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,140
All right, you guys,
let's move, move, move, move!

25
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,885
Come on boys, let's go!

26
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,577
This way! Left, right!

27
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,723
Come on, men, let's get the lead out!

28
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,880
We're close!

29
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,391
You're wasting our time. There's
nothing here but sheep and rocks.

30
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,496
- Ruins, not rocks.
- Hold it right here!

31
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,122
The remains of Trondham Abbey,
built on an intersection of ley lines...

32
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,394
...the boundaries between
our world and the others...

33
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,504
What a load of crap!

34
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,902
Hell, a week ago, I never even heard
the word "parabnormal. "

35
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,372
Paranormal.

36
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,136
Move it!

37
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,911
Hold the line.

38
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,775
Come on!

39
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,480
Sweet Jesus.

40
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,626
They must be here for the sheep.

41
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,339
The freak in the gas mask...

42
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,986
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.

43
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:46,453
Hitler's top assassin
and head of the Thule Occult Society.

44
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,728
If he's here, this is worse
than I thought.

45
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,018
No matter what happens tonight...

46
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,183
...this book will guide you
back to me.

47
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,352
I will not leave you.

48
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,361
I grant you everlasting life...

49
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,727
...youth...

50
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,996
...and the power to serve me.

51
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,306
Ilsa! Grigori!

52
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,033
It's time.

53
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,091
Five years of research
and construction, Grigori.

54
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,556
Five years!

55
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,059
The führer doesn't look kindly
on failure.

56
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,926
There will be no failure, general.

57
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,030
I promised Herr Hitler a miracle.

58
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,099
I'll deliver one.

59
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,020
What I will do tonight
can never be undone!

60
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,280
I will open a portal...

61
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,315
...and awaken the Ogdru Jahad:

62
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,188
The Seven Gods of Chaos!

63
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,460
Our enemies will be destroyed!

64
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,793
And from the ashes...

65
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:39,334
...a new Eden will arise.

66
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,718
Get down!

67
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,088
I was taking a picture.

68
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,891
You do that again
and I'll carve you a new one.

69
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,295
Listen, the portal is open.

70
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,528
Do you understand?
We have to stop them.

71
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,736
Go! Go! Go! Go!

72
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,485
Look out!

73
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,493
Get down!

74
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,232
It's almost over.

75
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,877
No, it's not.

76
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,373
The portal's been open for too long.

77
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,710
Something may have come through.

78
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,877
Have your men search
the area thoroughly.

79
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,222
Spread out over that way!

80
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,694
Sir! Something up here!

81
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,364
He's gone.

82
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,505
For now.

83
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,701
When you said something
came through...

84
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,943
From where?

85
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,616
I don't see them!

86
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:31,024
Do you really, really believe in hell?

87
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,465
There is a place,
a dark place...

88
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,662
...where ancient evil slumbers
and waits to return.

89
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,002
- Grigori gave us a glance tonight.
- Grigori?

90
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,776
That's Russian, right?

91
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,277
Grigori Efimovich Rasputin.

92
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,539
Rasputin?

93
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,151
- Come on!
- Occult adviser to the Romanovs.

94
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,117
In 1916, at a dinner in his honor...

95
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:01,191
...he was poisoned, shot,
stabbed, clubbed...

96
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,386
...castrated and finally drowned.

97
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,964
And yet, we saw him here tonight.

98
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,192
Professor Broom.

99
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,137
Careful. Be careful.

100
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,591
- What the hell is that? An ape?
- No.

101
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,292
It was red. Bright red.

102
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,438
Lower your light, you're scaring it.

103
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,270
- What are you two shooting at?
- A red ape!

104
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,968
No, it's not an ape.

105
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,978
It's got a big stone in its hand.

106
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,049
I think that is its hand.

107
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,448
Look at the size of that whammer.

108
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,422
No, wait! Wait!

109
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,492
A blanket. Get me a blanket.

110
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,628
Come on. Come on. It's safe.

111
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:49,958
Jump down.

112
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,400
Come on. Jump down.

113
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,737
It's a boy.

114
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,845
It's just a baby boy.

115
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,080
Move to the left.

116
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:15,523
<i>There we were, an unready father
for an unwanted child.</i>

117
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,193
<i>The boys gave him a name
that very night.</i>

118
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,630
<i>In retrospect,
perhaps not the most fortunate.</i>

119
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,568
<i>But nevertheless,
a name we all came to use.</i>

120
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,208
<i>We called him Hellboy.</i>

121
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,712
Look at the birdie.

122
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,887
<i>Speculation about the origins...</i>

123
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,396
<i>Evidence that Hellboy...</i>

124
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,776
<i>So, what is it exactly
that you say this agency does?</i>

125
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,248
<i>I kid you not. It hunts monsters.</i>

126
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,357
<i>The claim, of course,
that this creature...</i>

127
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,693
<i>...works for the FBI
as a monster hunter.</i>

128
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,339
What you seek is in there.

129
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,656
This is a sacred place.

130
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,496
Give me my gold.

131
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:14,932
We shouldn't be here.

132
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,896
Master.

133
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,093
Your eyes.

134
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,970
What did they do to your eyes?

135
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,348
- Have you told him yet?
- No.

136
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,576
We should.

137
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,228
Malignant sarcoma.

138
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,657
In the lungs...

139
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,730
...the spine...

140
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,700
...liver.
- Approximately...

141
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,270
...how long?
- Maybe six weeks.

142
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:02,403
I can arrange for hospitalization
and pain management.

143
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,779
- Make the time more bearable.
- No.

144
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,250
I'd rather be at home.

145
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,121
I have some arrangements to make.

146
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,655
For my son.

147
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,625
You can always get
a second opinion.

148
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,126
That won't be necessary.

149
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,634
Hurry up!

150
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,413
- Hurry up!
- Wait right here!

151
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,975
<i>Tom Manning is the head
of special operations at the FBI.</i>

152
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,883
<i>He joins Pat in the studio tonight
to go over the latest Hellboy sighting.</i>

153
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,889
There. That's the tail.

154
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,050
And these are the horns.

155
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,354
I have a question.

156
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,593
In the pictures of aliens, UFO,
the yeti, Hellboy...

157
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,566
...why is it they're always out of focus?

158
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,665
<i>Why don't you tell us...</i>

159
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,775
<i>...about the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense?</i>

160
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:08,003
I wanna tell you, I wanna tell
the American public one thing.

161
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,841
Now, this Bureau for the...

162
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:13,109
Paranormal Research and Defense.

163
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,623
There is no such thing.

164
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,740
"Waste Management Services"?

165
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,506
<i>What is it?</i>

166
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,709
John Myers, FBI.

167
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,078
Transfer from Quantico.

168
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,547
<i>Look at the birdie, son.</i>

169
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,608
- Hello. I'm John...
- You are late. That's what you are.

170
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,274
- Five minutes.
- Yes, I know.

171
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,682
- I'm going to...
- Section 51. I know.

172
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,248
Watch your hands and elbows.

173
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,915
- Pardon?
- Watch your hands and elbows.

174
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:56,882
Hello?

175
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,492
Turn the pages, please,
if you don't mind.

176
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,771
Please.

177
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773
The pages.

178
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,525
These? You're reading these?

179
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,778
Four books at once, every day...

180
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,781
...as long as I'm there
to turn the pages.

181
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,650
My name's Broom.

182
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,411
Professor Trevor Broom.

183
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,574
Sir, I'm John...

184
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,119
Agent John T. Myers,
Kansas City, '76.

185
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,587
T stands for Thaddeus,
mother's older brother.

186
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,953
Scar on your chin happened
when you were 10.

187
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,960
You still wonder if it's ever
going to fade away.

188
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,893
- How did it...?
- He.

189
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,194
Not "it. "

190
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,393
Abraham Sapien.

191
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,131
Discovered alive
in a secret chamber...

192
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,141
...of St. Trinian's
Foundling Hospital, Washington.

193
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,438
His name was taken
from this inscription...

194
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,207
...stuck to the side of his tank.
- "Icthyo Sapiens.

195
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,942
April 14, 1865."

196
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,914
The day that Abraham Lincoln died.

197
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,487
Hence, Abe Sapien.

198
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,189
Rotten eggs.

199
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,893
A delicacy. Abe loves them.

200
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,157
How does he know
so much about me?

201
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,564
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.

202
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:23,271
"Unique. " That's a word you'll hear
frequently around here.

203
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,976
Sir, where am I, exactly?

204
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,678
As you entered the lobby,
there was an inscription:

205
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:37,447
"In the absence of light,
darkness prevails. "

206
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,023
There are things that go bump
in the night, Agent Myers.

207
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,785
Make no mistake about that.

208
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:47,359
And we are the ones
who bump back.

209
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:54,868
1937, Hitler joins
the Thule Society...

210
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:58,770
...a group of German aristocrats
obsessed with the occult.

211
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:03,313
1938, he acquired
the Spear of Longinus...

212
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,313
...which pierced the side of Christ.

213
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,577
He who holds it becomes invincible.

214
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,620
Hitler's power increases tenfold.

215
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,589
1943, President Roosevelt
decides to fight back.

216
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,887
The Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense is born.

217
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,563
1958, the Occult Wars
finally come to an end...

218
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,224
...with the death of Adolf Hitler.

219
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,565
1945, you mean.

220
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,396
Hitler died in '45.

221
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,107
Did he, now?

222
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,576
Myers, this is Agent Clay.

223
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,114
Take his lead.

224
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,283
He'll make the introductions.

225
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,015
You're not coming?

226
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:52,829
I handpicked you from a roster of over
70 academy graduates.

227
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,590
Make me proud.

228
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,598
They're not speaking.

229
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,236
Professor Broom had him grounded.

230
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,737
Grounded? Who's grounded?

231
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,408
Okay. You saw the fish guy, right?

232
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,747
Oh, yeah. That was weird.

233
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,622
Yeah. Right.

234
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:29,230
Well, come on in.
Meet the rest of the family.

235
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,635
He gets fed six times a day.

236
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,327
He's got a thing for cats.

237
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,440
You'll be his nanny,
his keeper, his best friend.

238
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,274
He never goes out unsupervised.

239
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:40,433
Who?

240
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,247
I hate those comic books.

241
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,449
They never get the eyes right.

242
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,953
Hellboy.

243
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:00,753
He's real.

244
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:04,368
60 years old by our count.
But he doesn't age like we do.

245
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,903
Think reverse dog years.
He's barely out of his 20s.

246
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,472
What's with the hair, Clay?

247
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,804
Finally got them implants, huh?

248
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,979
It'll fill in.

249
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,641
Who's the squirt?

250
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,644
Agent Myers is your new liaison.

251
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,984
I don't want him.

252
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,317
What, you get tired of me, Clay?

253
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,860
The candy. Give him the candy.

254
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,121
Oh, sir, I...

255
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,128
I have these for you.

256
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,660
Father's back?

257
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,429
- He still angry?
- Well, you did break out.

258
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,800
I wanted to see her.

259
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,802
- Nobody's business.
- It is. You got yourself on TV again.

260
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,806
Myers, huh?

261
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,546
You got a first name, Myers?

262
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,446
Try not to stare.
He hates it when people stare.

263
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,022
John. John Myers.

264
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,123
Well, John'll do.

265
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:04,456
- Stare at what?
- His horns. He files them to fit in.

266
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,369
What you looking at, John?

267
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,739
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing.
Nothing at all.

268
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,242
<i>Code red.</i>

269
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,402
Hey, hey, hey.

270
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,912
<i>Warning. Code red.</i>

271
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,447
They're playing our song.

272
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,183
Come on, champ,
let's go fight some monsters.

273
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,395
We're here at the Machen Library...

274
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,326
...where just hours ago,
an alarm was triggered.

275
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,433
The N.Y.P.D. has yet
to issue a statement.

276
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,038
We've got SWAT vans, paramedics.
You name it.

277
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,298
And now here comes
a garbage truck.

278
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,465
A large garbage truck.

279
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,538
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue.

280
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,343
One sheet of glass
between them and us.

281
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,314
Story of my life.

282
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,946
Outside.
I could be outside.

283
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,022
You mean, outside with her.

284
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,459
Don't get psychic with me, fella.

285
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,496
Nothing psychic about it.

286
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,163
You're easy.

287
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,303
How am I gonna get a girl?
I drive around in a garbage truck.

288
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,739
Liz left us, Red.

289
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,675
Take the hint.

290
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,743
We don't take hints.

291
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,189
Civilians in bedroom.

292
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,569
Okay, guys,
let's sync up our locators.

293
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,152
Seal the doors.
Red and Blue are coming in.

294
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,453
1900 hours, an alarm was tripped.

295
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,061
A large entity, type 5, reported.
Very aggressive.

296
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,388
Six guards dead.

297
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,360
I thought we checked this place.

298
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,999
Fakes and reproductions.

299
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,965
Apparently, not everything was fake.

300
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,204
Father.

301
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,242
The entity is still in there.

302
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:43,319
Video surveillance shows
a 16th-century statue was destroyed.

303
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,680
St. Dionysius the Areopagite.

304
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,621
- Who wards off demons.
- Exactly.

305
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:53,061
The statue, however, was hollow.

306
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,331
A reliquary.

307
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,265
A prison.

308
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,666
The Vatican deemed its occupant
dangerous enough...

309
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,435
...to include it on The List of Avignon,
of which, by the way, we hold a copy.

310
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,874
Perfect job for these babies.

311
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,603
Made them myself.

312
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:14,246
Holy water, clove leaf, silver
shavings, white oak. The works.

313
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,923
Behind this door, a dark entity.

314
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:26,493
Evil, ancient and hungry.

315
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:30,532
Oh, well.
Let me go in and say hi.

316
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,798
<i>You better hit the books,
Brother Blue.</i>

317
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,992
<i>We'll definitely need
more info on this one.</i>

318
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,331
Hey, no one goes with him? Jesus.

319
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,871
No. He likes it that way.

320
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,408
The whole "lonely hero" thing.

321
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,324
Hey, Stinky.

322
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,424
Kitchen's closed.

323
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,556
What you having?

324
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,228
Six library guards, raw,
plus belts and boots.

325
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:44,569
Man, you're gonna need
some heavy fiber to move that out.

326
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,607
<i>Red, I found something.</i>

327
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,809
This entity's name is Sammael,
the desolate one.

328
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,710
Son of Nergal, brother of...

329
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,754
Listen, Sammy...

330
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:11,292
...I'm not a very good shot, but The
Samaritan here uses really big bullets.

331
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:23,812
So, what do you say we work this out
in a nice, peaceful...

332
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,649
Oh, crap.

333
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,161
That's it for you, Sam.

334
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:46,297
<i>Red, you need to hear
the rest of the information.</i>

335
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,731
No, he's taken care of.

336
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,841
No, listen to this.

337
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:55,210
"Sammael, the desolate one,
lord of the shadows...

338
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,315
<i>...son of Nergal,
hound of resurrection... "</i>

339
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,082
See...

340
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,551
...I don't like that.

341
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,553
<i>What? Hound of resurrection?</i>

342
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,186
<i>"Harbinger of pestilence.
Seed of destruc... "</i>

343
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,727
Cut to the end. How do I kill it?

344
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,262
<i>Doesn't say.</i>

345
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,032
Go to the front. Let's go! Move!

346
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,833
I'm going around the back.

347
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,226
Oh, crap.

348
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,196
Child.

349
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,668
All grown up, I see.

350
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,569
That voice.

351
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:00,369
It was the first lullaby
you ever heard, my son.

352
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,070
I ushered you into this world.

353
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:07,013
I alone know your true calling,
your true name.

354
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,084
Name this.

355
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,773
- That thing. That thing.
- What do you think you're doing?

356
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,503
- What do you think you're doing?
- Helping you. L...

357
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,271
Nobody helps me!

358
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,880
It's my job.

359
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,547
You want to help? Here.
Load this.

360
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,694
It's a tracking bullet. Crack the pin.

361
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,699
Jesus, what's that on your arm?

362
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,200
Oh, crap.

363
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,804
What the hell is that thing?

364
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,899
Let me go ask.

365
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,429
All right, keep coming.
Good. Keep coming.

366
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,469
Why, you little...

367
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,654
Wait!

368
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,793
We're heading toward civilians.

369
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,674
Crazy costumes, huh?
Trick or treat.

370
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,608
Red means stop!

371
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,017
- You all right?
- Yeah.

372
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,286
Stay here.

373
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,542
Sammy, you got a leak.

374
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,778
Waiting for me, chunk-face?

375
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,947
What the...?

376
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,655
- I'm on your side.
- Sure.

377
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,968
That's right!

378
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,323
Open wide!

379
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,055
Son of a...

380
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,864
Yuck!

381
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,871
Screw this.

382
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,087
I'm fireproof.

383
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,860
You're not.

384
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:25,758
Hey, Myers.

385
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,199
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

386
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,033
<i>How's your arm?</i>

387
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:33,267
Yeah, my arm's fine.
Where are you?

388
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,412
I just fried Stinky.

389
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,240
Listen...

390
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,039
...tell Father I'll be home...

391
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,649
<i>...but he shouldn't wait up.</i>

392
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,217
No. No, wait, wait.

393
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,819
<i>Yeah, I gotta go with you.</i>

394
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,548
- Hey, Myers.
- Yeah?

395
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,355
Bye.

396
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,392
Damn it.

397
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:11,105
Sammael has fulfilled his destiny.

398
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,903
Die in peace...

399
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,514
...and be reborn again and again.

400
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,951
Only seven more days
till the eclipse.

401
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:30,253
The child will be there,
and so will we all.

402
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,323
Won't we?

403
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,810
There's a big, red man down there.

404
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,848
That's fine, darling.
Santa's not here for another month.

405
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:28,780
Not Santa.

406
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,716
Well, who, then?

407
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,528
I brought beer.

408
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,835
Oh, Red, your arm.

409
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,529
You better get that looked at.

410
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,209
I wanted to see you.

411
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,476
Every time the media gets
a look at him, they run to me.

412
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,236
I'm running out of lies, Trevor.

413
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,972
- I thought you like being on TV.
- I do.

414
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:34,843
So how many escapes
this year alone? Five.

415
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,249
Tom, he's our guest, not a prisoner.

416
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:41,653
Your guest is 6-foot-5, bright red,
has a tail and is government-funded.

417
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,190
I know where to find him.

418
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,323
- I'll get him back.
- Hey, fish stick.

419
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,790
Don't touch anything.

420
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,160
I need to touch it to see.

421
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:53,462
- See what?
- Past, future.

422
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:57,000
Whatever this object holds.

423
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,300
Is he serious?

424
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,444
Don't worry about fingerprints.
Never had any.

425
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:06,548
Professor, they were here.

426
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:13,245
Who was here? Nixon? Houdini?

427
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,324
Jimmy Hoffa? Who?

428
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:19,155
Show me, Abe.
Show me what happened here.

429
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,739
<i>This is east-wing check-in.
We're all clear.</i>

430
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,942
<i>Also, make sure it's all locked up
over there in the annex.</i>

431
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,244
<i>Roger that.</i>

432
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,809
Kroenen!

433
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:14,944
Move.

434
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,126
Move!

435
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:33,796
There he is!

436
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,143
We'll cover him from here!

437
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,583
All right, don't move! Put that down.

438
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,613
Put down the weapon!

439
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:51,977
Get them.

440
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,748
Drop the weapon.

441
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:57,753
On the ground!

442
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:03,790
Last warning!

443
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,434
Take him out!

444
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:41,471
Now, ready the welcome, my love.

445
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:52,143
Salt gathered from the tears
of a thousand angels.

446
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,640
Restraining the essence...

447
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:58,049
...of Sammael, the hellhound.

448
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:02,356
The seed of destruction.

449
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,931
This I can promise, Sammael.

450
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,034
For each one of you that falls...

451
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,700
...two shall arise.

452
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,412
- Professor.
- I'm all right.

453
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:02,849
Professor.

454
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,484
You...

455
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:11,224
You are very sick.

456
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:15,623
I don't want Hellboy to know.

457
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:21,226
Sixty years ago,
they tried to destroy the world.

458
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,929
They're back.

459
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:27,068
In my lifetime, they're back...

460
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:30,174
...to finish the job.

461
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,911
We miss you at the bureau.

462
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,349
Abe's crazier every day.

463
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,751
Father's still mad at me.

464
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,791
Come back, Liz.

465
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,693
- Come back.
- No. No, H.B.

466
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,097
No, not this time.

467
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,301
I don't like it here...

468
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,701
...but I haven't had an episode
in months.

469
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,478
And you know what?

470
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,783
I'm learning to control it.

471
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,421
I'm learning where it comes from.

472
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,250
For the first time in my life...

473
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,488
...I'm not afraid.

474
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:31,402
- Looks like your ride is here.
- Have escort stand by.

475
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,537
The Nanny Squad.

476
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,412
Hey, stop. Wait. Wait.

477
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,048
Sir, may I go first?

478
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,915
Hang on a minute.

479
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,555
He barely knows him.

480
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:50,716
Then he should make it his business
to change that.

481
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,632
Listen, H. B...

482
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,291
...I've got a chance out here.

483
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:02,232
So if you really care about me...

484
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:08,304
...you won't come back.

485
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,022
Yeah...

486
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:22,889
...I gotta go too.

487
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:26,825
Lots to do.

488
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,036
What took you so long?

489
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,811
Come on, time to go home.

490
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,077
Tape you up.

491
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,044
What are you, a Boy Scout?

492
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:55,086
- Nope, I never was.
- Well, you could have fooled me.

493
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,058
Hey, Red.

494
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,056
Oh, God. You've lost a lot of blood.

495
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,664
This is nothing.

496
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,427
You know what'll kill me, don't you?

497
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,871
Okay, Red, let's get you home.
Come on.

498
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:32,488
You were burned
by some organic acid.

499
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,323
I'm lucky that way.

500
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,695
- I worry about you.
- Me?

501
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,533
Well...

502
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,198
...I won't be around forever,
you know.

503
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,468
Damn!

504
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:50,836
Could you please be a little careful?

505
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:52,342
Big baby.

506
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,417
How long was it latched onto you?

507
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,254
I don't know. About five seconds.

508
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,881
- Professor, look.
- Is it bad?

509
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:07,686
Touched you five seconds,
laid three eggs.

510
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,866
Didn't even buy me a drink.

511
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:18,970
The stinger detaches itself from
the tongue and injects the eggs.

512
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:23,010
They are very sensitive
to heat and light.

513
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:29,417
They need a humid,
dark environment to breed.

514
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,577
Did you ever lose track of him?

515
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,780
Well, let's see.

516
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:38,917
There was that moment when
I had the train on top of my head.

517
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,757
We can't risk it.

518
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,230
Tomorrow you'll go back to the tracks
with a group of agents.

519
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:47,199
Search the whole place
top to bottom.

520
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,565
Find those eggs and destroy them.

521
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,543
"Elizabeth Sherman. "

522
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,816
<i>I don't like the term "fire-starter. "</i>

523
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:07,078
<i>I just don't.</i>

524
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:11,627
<i>And "pyrokinesis" sounds like
some psychosis or something.</i>

525
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,023
<i>I don't know.</i>

526
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,221
<i>Maybe that's right.</i>

527
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:17,764
<i>Not being able to let go.</i>

528
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,231
<i>It's scary.</i>

529
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:24,364
<i>I black out after each episode.
Sometimes for hours.</i>

530
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,339
<i>You hear about so and so...</i>

531
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:30,036
<i>...who just lost control
and just exploded.</i>

532
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,942
<i>Well, they're lucky it isn't true.</i>

533
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,341
<i>With me, it is.</i>

534
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:51,092
My master is calling
your name now, my girl.

535
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,599
You must return to the child.

536
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,897
So once again...

537
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,535
...dream...

538
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,103
...of fire.

539
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,090
Hey, freak!

540
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,157
Get back here, freak!

541
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,857
- Let's get her!
- Get her!

542
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,332
- Get her, guys!
- Watch this!

543
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,998
Freak!

544
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,202
Oh, no! Not again.

545
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,045
Oh, no! Somebody!

546
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,615
Help me!

547
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:43,911
Help me, somebody! Help me!

548
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:33,234
How many buildings
does she have to burn down?

549
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,234
She belongs here.

550
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:36,869
That's not what she feels.

551
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,443
She may never feel it.
It's her choice.

552
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:41,945
Professor, the girl you're...

553
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:46,950
Professor,
that girl you're talking about...

554
00:54:46,985 --> 00:54:48,302
Hey, Boy Scout...

555
00:54:48,337 --> 00:54:49,619
...think twice.

556
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,710
No, listen, I read her file.

557
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,713
- "Read her file. "
- She blames herself...

558
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:58,657
...for that explosion in Pittsburgh.
Look, I think I can help.

559
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,260
I could talk to her.

560
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,262
I think I could bring her back.

561
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,033
Just what was it that landed you
this job pushing "pamcakes," huh?

562
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:08,894
What was it?

563
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:12,098
Punctuality?
The way you part your hair?

564
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,266
What is your area of expertise?

565
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,546
<i>He doesn't want me with him.</i>

566
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:20,042
I know that much.

567
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,480
- You're doing fine.
- No, I'm not.

568
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,882
Look, he respects Clay, not me.

569
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,419
I'm really sorry, okay?

570
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,959
I'm not your guy.

571
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,797
I'm dying, Agent Myers.

572
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,068
Like any father, I worry about him.

573
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:46,236
In medieval stories,
there is often a young knight...

574
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:49,970
...who is inexperienced...

575
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:53,675
...but pure of heart.
- Come on.

576
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,045
Look, I am not pure of heart.

577
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:57,777
Yes, you are.

578
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,350
Rasputin is back for him.

579
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,354
What I ask of you...

580
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:07,587
...is to have the courage
to stand by him when I am gone.

581
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,059
He was born a demon.
Can't change that.

582
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:13,259
But you will help him...

583
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,868
...in essence...

584
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,097
...to become a man.

585
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:34,579
Pull that down.

586
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,658
<i>She was making great progress...</i>

587
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:37,986
...and now this.

588
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,152
We'll be closed for months.

589
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,662
And it put a big dent
in our Thorazine supply.

590
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,226
She's been like this
since it happened.

591
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:51,767
Are you sure you want to go in?

592
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,483
Miss Sherman?

593
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:04,279
I'm Agent Myers, FBI.

594
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,588
Miss Sherman?

595
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:14,190
Can I call you Liz?

596
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,798
It's a beautiful name.

597
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:20,595
Sixty percent of all the women
in the world are named Liz.

598
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:25,430
Well, it's impressive by my standards.
My name's John.

599
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,277
John T. Myers.

600
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:31,380
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you
back to the bureau.

601
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:35,177
No special precautions,
no security escorts.

602
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:38,809
Just you and me in a taxi
like regular folks.

603
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,620
That doesn't sound like him.

604
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:45,158
Well, Miss Sherman,
he's asking you back...

605
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:47,523
...but it's entirely your choice,
you know?

606
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:49,388
Choice, huh?

607
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,363
That's cute.

608
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:54,867
I've quit the bureau 13 times.

609
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:57,268
I always go back.

610
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,635
Where else would I go?

611
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:18,917
Over here.

612
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:22,887
You said those eggs need it
dark and humid?

613
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,000
Well, they hit the jackpot.

614
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,501
The subway lines,
they all converge right around here.

615
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:31,105
Right below us
is the old Vandeveer reservoir.

616
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,071
It was abandoned in the mid-30s.

617
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,834
There's a pulse.

618
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,911
There. A cistern on the other side.

619
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,547
Most of the eggs are there.

620
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,021
There's no way in.

621
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,496
We should go back and request
a special permit, type 2...

622
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,445
You guys coming or what?

623
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,664
We lead a charmed life.

624
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,051
Here you are, doctor.

625
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,259
This should cover your tail fin.

626
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,761
Reliquary. Straight from the Vatican.

627
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,767
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.

628
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,670
Remind me why I keep doing this.

629
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,332
Rotten eggs
and the safety of mankind.

630
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:57,613
This doesn't really look
like doll's hair.

631
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,516
Be honest, Red. What do you think?

632
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,588
I'm thinking about doing it myself.

633
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,485
Hey, you guys find anything?

634
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,651
<i>No eggs yet, Red.</i>

635
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,626
<i>What, are you on a lunch break?</i>

636
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,163
Nothing here.

637
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,806
Red's on the move. I'll cover him.

638
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,585
Damn it, Red.

639
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:16,680
Hey, it's Abe.

640
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,390
Oh, God.

641
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,792
Bring your toy over here.

642
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,663
Oh, man.

643
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:32,806
Oh, Jesus.

644
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,538
There's only one. I'll fry him quick.

645
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:38,805
Two. There were two.

646
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,068
Red?

647
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:10,041
Red. Come in, Red.

648
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:13,410
What's your 20? I got no signal.
Where the hell are you?

649
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,915
<i>It's like Swiss cheese in here.</i>

650
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,486
Sit tight, pal, I'm on him.

651
01:04:35,535 --> 01:04:38,368
Sammael, hound of the resurrection.

652
01:04:42,108 --> 01:04:44,008
Didn't I kill you already?

653
01:04:54,587 --> 01:04:57,215
You goddamn monster!

654
01:05:19,512 --> 01:05:20,536
Oh, crap.

655
01:05:35,996 --> 01:05:37,293
It's for you!

656
01:05:37,464 --> 01:05:40,262
You shouldn't hurt people!

657
01:06:01,187 --> 01:06:02,381
You missed.

658
01:06:22,142 --> 01:06:24,406
Hey, chunk-face.

659
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:29,571
You can do better than that,
big monster like you.

660
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,068
My kittens! Please!

661
01:07:23,103 --> 01:07:26,106
Somebody, please, get my kittens!

662
01:07:30,877 --> 01:07:32,310
Second date.

663
01:07:33,213 --> 01:07:34,680
No tongue.

664
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,794
My kittens. Careful with them!

665
01:07:49,963 --> 01:07:51,954
Lady, give me a break!

666
01:08:12,485 --> 01:08:13,474
Thank you.

667
01:08:15,155 --> 01:08:16,179
My job.

668
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:13,213
<i>Clay, I'm getting a signal from Abe.
I'm on my way back.</i>

669
01:09:16,216 --> 01:09:18,718
Buddy, don't take another step.

670
01:09:44,043 --> 01:09:45,772
Clay.

671
01:10:19,912 --> 01:10:22,938
Man down. I need an ambulance
right away. Do you read me?

672
01:10:23,149 --> 01:10:24,776
Hang in there, pal.

673
01:10:25,184 --> 01:10:28,585
Man down.
Do you read? Do you read?

674
01:10:31,057 --> 01:10:33,321
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?

675
01:10:33,893 --> 01:10:36,885
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?
Man down!

676
01:10:42,769 --> 01:10:46,796
Feels good to be outside.
It's been so long.

677
01:10:46,973 --> 01:10:49,533
You know that's...
That's not safe Miss Sherman.

678
01:10:49,709 --> 01:10:51,540
Please stay in the car.

679
01:10:55,815 --> 01:10:59,911
No, no. Miss Sherman. Please,
can you come down, Miss Sherman?

680
01:11:08,494 --> 01:11:10,086
Nice view.

681
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:14,932
Hey, a smile, huh?
Yeah, that's good.

682
01:11:15,501 --> 01:11:17,162
Here.

683
01:11:18,671 --> 01:11:20,434
Damn.

684
01:11:21,274 --> 01:11:25,438
- You'll have to take another one later.
- Yeah.

685
01:11:49,168 --> 01:11:51,193
He'll make it.

686
01:11:53,239 --> 01:11:55,400
Not everyone was so lucky.

687
01:11:56,976 --> 01:11:59,342
We had two agents die today.

688
01:12:00,012 --> 01:12:02,446
Clay probably won't survive
the night.

689
01:12:02,615 --> 01:12:05,345
- Not now, Manning, please.
- My problem with you:

690
01:12:07,053 --> 01:12:08,520
You're reckless.

691
01:12:08,688 --> 01:12:12,021
These men trusted you
to lead them as a team.

692
01:12:12,191 --> 01:12:14,056
Where were you?

693
01:12:14,927 --> 01:12:16,792
I knew those men
better than you did.

694
01:12:16,963 --> 01:12:20,660
- That makes it all right, then.
- No, it doesn't make it all right.

695
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:24,404
- But I stopped that thing, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

696
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:26,924
It's what you do.
It's why we need you.

697
01:12:26,959 --> 01:12:29,409
You have an insight.
You know monsters.

698
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:32,912
What are you trying to say?

699
01:12:33,913 --> 01:12:36,416
This whole thing is a farce.

700
01:12:36,916 --> 01:12:37,917
Because in the end...

701
01:12:38,418 --> 01:12:41,753
...after you've killed, after you've
captured every freak out there...

702
01:12:42,688 --> 01:12:44,485
...there's still one left.

703
01:12:45,358 --> 01:12:46,848
You.

704
01:12:51,297 --> 01:12:53,026
Hey, Manning.

705
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,793
I wish I could be more gracious, but...

706
01:13:02,175 --> 01:13:04,575
Welcome back.

707
01:13:06,212 --> 01:13:08,840
It's only for the weekend,
Professor Broom.

708
01:13:09,749 --> 01:13:12,217
Then I shall be on my way.

709
01:13:12,385 --> 01:13:15,354
Oh, you should have a look around.

710
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:17,887
We made some changes
around here.

711
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:28,997
I want that thing locked up,
starting now.

712
01:13:29,168 --> 01:13:30,931
Right now! Do you...?

713
01:13:31,304 --> 01:13:33,204
Now, you hear me?

714
01:13:33,372 --> 01:13:35,306
- Locked up!
- Nothing's changed.

715
01:13:35,508 --> 01:13:36,634
Home sweet home.

716
01:13:36,943 --> 01:13:38,171
Liz?

717
01:13:40,746 --> 01:13:42,407
Liz!

718
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:47,146
You did it, buddy. You did it!

719
01:13:50,723 --> 01:13:52,520
Myers?

720
01:13:53,059 --> 01:13:54,754
Pop?

721
01:14:02,668 --> 01:14:05,102
Hey, how you doing?

722
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:07,262
Hey, what's that on your wrist?

723
01:14:08,374 --> 01:14:09,966
This?

724
01:14:10,142 --> 01:14:14,374
- It's something I learned in therapy.
- Yeah?

725
01:14:14,547 --> 01:14:17,539
I'm depressed, one rubber band.

726
01:14:17,717 --> 01:14:19,514
I'm impatient...

727
01:14:21,754 --> 01:14:23,585
...two rubber bands.

728
01:14:23,756 --> 01:14:25,621
Maybe...

729
01:14:27,827 --> 01:14:30,193
Maybe I should get you
a fresh pack.

730
01:14:32,498 --> 01:14:34,227
Yeah, maybe two.

731
01:14:34,767 --> 01:14:36,735
Yeah, maybe.

732
01:14:44,844 --> 01:14:47,210
I'm gonna put these over here, okay?

733
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:48,642
One minute. One minute.

734
01:14:52,118 --> 01:14:53,676
Hey, Myers...

735
01:14:53,853 --> 01:14:55,980
...you're a talker.

736
01:14:56,222 --> 01:14:59,453
What's a good word,
a solid word, for "need"?

737
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:00,785
Well...

738
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,951
..."need" is a good, solid word.

739
01:15:03,129 --> 01:15:04,357
Too needy.

740
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:06,998
Start in, okay?
You got nachos coming.

741
01:15:08,834 --> 01:15:09,960
Nachos.

742
01:15:10,136 --> 01:15:11,728
Oh, my God.

743
01:15:11,904 --> 01:15:13,735
Look at them all.

744
01:15:14,473 --> 01:15:16,600
Who had babies?

745
01:15:18,244 --> 01:15:23,204
Liz, there's something I need
for you to hear, and it's...

746
01:15:23,382 --> 01:15:25,873
Will it take long?
Because I'm actually going out.

747
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:28,642
Out?

748
01:15:30,189 --> 01:15:31,178
"Out" out?

749
01:15:31,724 --> 01:15:35,717
Yeah. Yeah, for a cup of coffee,
but go ahead, read.

750
01:15:35,895 --> 01:15:37,385
Are you going alone?

751
01:15:38,898 --> 01:15:41,230
No, Myers is taking me.

752
01:15:42,234 --> 01:15:44,634
Hey, your chili's getting cold.

753
01:15:45,237 --> 01:15:46,261
Not hungry.

754
01:15:48,341 --> 01:15:50,400
Is there something
you'd like me to hear?

755
01:15:50,576 --> 01:15:53,272
- It's just a list. It's not finished.
- Okay.

756
01:15:53,446 --> 01:15:55,380
Well, then, later.

757
01:15:56,148 --> 01:15:57,877
See you.

758
01:15:59,185 --> 01:16:01,278
- Anything else you need?
- Not from you.

759
01:16:02,455 --> 01:16:03,444
Well, good night.

760
01:16:04,657 --> 01:16:05,817
Goodbye.

761
01:16:15,635 --> 01:16:18,798
Subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.

762
01:16:19,138 --> 01:16:22,039
Born in Munich, 1897.

763
01:16:23,109 --> 01:16:26,010
Suffered from
a masochistic compulsion...

764
01:16:26,879 --> 01:16:30,212
...commonly known
as surgical addiction.

765
01:16:33,619 --> 01:16:37,020
Both eyelids surgically removed...

766
01:16:40,292 --> 01:16:42,157
...along with his upper...

767
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:45,154
...and lower lip.

768
01:16:46,966 --> 01:16:50,959
The blood in his veins
dried up decades ago.

769
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:55,935
Only dust remains.

770
01:16:59,311 --> 01:17:02,337
What horrible will...

771
01:17:03,182 --> 01:17:06,242
...could keep such a creature
as this alive?

772
01:17:40,286 --> 01:17:42,277
Oh, no.

773
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:46,081
Come on, Red.

774
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,855
Jesus.

775
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:59,266
Damn it, Red. Not again

776
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:03,500
And one of those cookies.
Do you have any doughnuts?

777
01:18:03,676 --> 01:18:06,008
Sorry, pal. How about a bear claw?

778
01:18:23,763 --> 01:18:26,857
Do you want anything else?
The shop's closing.

779
01:18:27,032 --> 01:18:28,863
Here we go.

780
01:18:29,068 --> 01:18:30,797
Listen about...

781
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:33,764
I admire him. He's a force of nature.

782
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:36,533
What are you two talking about?

783
01:18:36,709 --> 01:18:40,008
What is so fascinating,
so important?

784
01:18:40,179 --> 01:18:42,545
No. He's determined, unstoppable.

785
01:18:42,715 --> 01:18:44,706
Some people would call that cocky.

786
01:18:44,884 --> 01:18:47,375
- He's just strong.
- Yeah. That he is.

787
01:18:47,553 --> 01:18:49,020
Hey, I've got yours.

788
01:18:49,789 --> 01:18:54,385
My uncle, he used to say
we like people for their qualities...

789
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,755
...but love them for their defects.

790
01:18:58,798 --> 01:19:00,561
He loves you, you know.

791
01:19:02,835 --> 01:19:04,234
What about you?

792
01:19:05,905 --> 01:19:08,635
I don't know. I grew up with him.

793
01:19:10,476 --> 01:19:13,445
But now every time I see him,
I get confused.

794
01:19:13,612 --> 01:19:16,581
There's hardly a day that goes by
that he's not in my mind.

795
01:19:16,749 --> 01:19:17,909
Even now...

796
01:19:19,051 --> 01:19:21,144
...I feel like he's here.

797
01:19:22,588 --> 01:19:24,146
Hey, wait up.

798
01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:29,626
You like doughnuts? I got two.

799
01:19:30,462 --> 01:19:33,260
- Thanks. That was nice.
- I got a cookie, as well.

800
01:19:33,432 --> 01:19:35,662
- Sugar?
- No. No sugar. Thank you.

801
01:19:35,835 --> 01:19:38,326
No cream and sugar, moron.
She takes it black.

802
01:19:38,771 --> 01:19:41,672
- I got some milk here.
- No. I'm okay. I don't take milk.

803
01:19:42,474 --> 01:19:43,702
Told you.

804
01:19:47,546 --> 01:19:49,036
She took his picture.

805
01:19:49,515 --> 01:19:50,675
Damn!

806
01:19:52,852 --> 01:19:54,683
She took his picture.

807
01:19:57,056 --> 01:19:58,717
She took his picture.

808
01:20:01,594 --> 01:20:03,084
She took his picture.

809
01:20:06,398 --> 01:20:07,695
Oh, crap.

810
01:20:17,243 --> 01:20:18,767
It's freezing, isn't it?

811
01:20:19,411 --> 01:20:21,242
Coffee's warming me up.

812
01:20:22,548 --> 01:20:24,311
Well, what do we do now?

813
01:20:24,483 --> 01:20:27,884
Newark, New Jersey,
entertainment capital of the world.

814
01:20:28,587 --> 01:20:31,385
- You sound like a game-show host.
- Hi.

815
01:20:31,757 --> 01:20:33,224
Hey.

816
01:20:35,628 --> 01:20:36,686
You're Hellboy.

817
01:20:40,432 --> 01:20:42,400
I'm on a mission.

818
01:20:45,304 --> 01:20:48,637
All right, tell me something about you.
Where do you come from?

819
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:51,173
I lived with my uncle most of my life.

820
01:20:51,343 --> 01:20:54,938
Then I went to Quantico, went to top
of my class. I'm nothing like...

821
01:20:55,347 --> 01:20:56,541
Don't tell anyone, huh?

822
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:01,411
Attaboy.

823
01:21:09,828 --> 01:21:12,023
Sir, he left his locator.

824
01:21:12,197 --> 01:21:16,395
- Shall we send out some scouts?
- Enough, enough, enough.

825
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:20,604
He'll never change.

826
01:21:20,906 --> 01:21:22,498
A child.

827
01:21:23,609 --> 01:21:26,043
Always a child.

828
01:21:40,659 --> 01:21:45,062
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

829
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:46,959
Moscow.

830
01:21:47,132 --> 01:21:49,930
Who wants us in Moscow?

831
01:22:37,182 --> 01:22:39,844
- My mom baked them.
- She's laughing.

832
01:22:40,753 --> 01:22:43,449
She's sitting on a park bench,
and she's laughing.

833
01:22:44,023 --> 01:22:46,548
That's it. I'm done.

834
01:22:46,959 --> 01:22:48,859
They don't look like spies.

835
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,696
Are you kidding me?

836
01:22:52,031 --> 01:22:53,692
Look at this guy.

837
01:22:53,866 --> 01:22:57,563
Those shady little eyes,
that phony grin.

838
01:22:58,103 --> 01:23:00,537
- Are you going to eat that?
- No.

839
01:23:02,207 --> 01:23:05,335
Hey, he's yawning. He's bored.

840
01:23:05,511 --> 01:23:08,105
Yeah, the old yawning trick.

841
01:23:10,182 --> 01:23:11,774
Watch his arm.

842
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:21,982
First he wants my job,
then he wants my girl.

843
01:23:25,664 --> 01:23:28,929
Hey, we all have a side
that we try to hide.

844
01:23:35,407 --> 01:23:36,999
God...

845
01:23:37,276 --> 01:23:38,868
Hey, what the hell?

846
01:23:39,044 --> 01:23:42,241
Hey! Hey, who threw that?

847
01:23:45,184 --> 01:23:48,210
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

848
01:23:51,290 --> 01:23:52,814
Nice shot.

849
01:23:57,563 --> 01:24:01,590
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

850
01:24:02,301 --> 01:24:04,963
It's Rasputin's mausoleum.

851
01:24:12,244 --> 01:24:13,973
I see the puppet.

852
01:24:14,746 --> 01:24:17,010
But where is...

853
01:24:17,983 --> 01:24:19,507
...the puppeteer?

854
01:24:19,685 --> 01:24:21,619
Very good, Professor Broom.

855
01:24:23,455 --> 01:24:24,922
It was you.

856
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:27,558
The scraps of paper...

857
01:24:27,726 --> 01:24:30,524
...Liz's sudden relapse and return.

858
01:24:30,696 --> 01:24:32,596
Bread crumbs on the trail.

859
01:24:32,764 --> 01:24:34,595
Like in a fable.

860
01:24:34,967 --> 01:24:36,992
They both distract him...

861
01:24:37,769 --> 01:24:39,896
...and guide him exactly
where I need him.

862
01:24:40,072 --> 01:24:41,232
Moscow.

863
01:24:41,406 --> 01:24:43,397
His destiny.

864
01:24:44,843 --> 01:24:46,140
And the last clue...

865
01:24:46,311 --> 01:24:49,439
...will be left by
the late Professor Broom.

866
01:24:49,615 --> 01:24:51,310
You raised the child.

867
01:24:51,483 --> 01:24:53,348
Nurtured him.

868
01:24:53,519 --> 01:24:55,612
So in return...

869
01:24:56,054 --> 01:24:57,646
...I will permit you...

870
01:24:57,823 --> 01:25:02,487
...a brief, brief glimpse of the future.

871
01:25:30,989 --> 01:25:33,150
<i>He will open the portal...</i>

872
01:25:33,325 --> 01:25:36,192
<i>...and bring about
the end of the world.</i>

873
01:25:40,499 --> 01:25:43,991
<i>If only you had had him destroyed
60 years ago...</i>

874
01:25:44,169 --> 01:25:46,330
<i>...none of this would have
come to pass.</i>

875
01:25:46,505 --> 01:25:49,872
<i>But then,
how could you have known?</i>

876
01:25:50,042 --> 01:25:53,102
<i>Your God chooses to remain silent.</i>

877
01:25:53,845 --> 01:25:56,143
Mine lives within me.

878
01:25:56,315 --> 01:25:58,909
Every time I died and crossed over...

879
01:25:59,851 --> 01:26:04,151
...a little more of the master...

880
01:26:04,323 --> 01:26:06,621
...came back with me.

881
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:10,693
He disclosed to me
the child's true name.

882
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:13,361
Would you like to know it?

883
01:26:13,532 --> 01:26:17,229
I know what to call him.

884
01:26:19,171 --> 01:26:22,937
Nothing you can do or say...

885
01:26:23,108 --> 01:26:25,338
...can change that.

886
01:26:26,245 --> 01:26:28,213
I call him...

887
01:26:30,515 --> 01:26:31,777
...Son.

888
01:26:37,356 --> 01:26:39,153
I'm ready.

889
01:26:41,293 --> 01:26:42,590
It'll be quick.

890
01:27:06,985 --> 01:27:10,318
Just go there
and tell her how you feel.

891
01:27:12,557 --> 01:27:13,717
My mom says that...

892
01:27:13,892 --> 01:27:16,827
Look, it's not...
It's not that easy, okay?

893
01:27:19,564 --> 01:27:21,691
Plus, you're 9.

894
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:24,794
You're not old enough
to be giving me advice.

895
01:27:26,772 --> 01:27:29,434
- All right, stand by.
- Who are those guys?

896
01:27:37,316 --> 01:27:41,013
Liz, I'm sorry. It's Broom.
Let's go. We need to find him.

897
01:27:41,186 --> 01:27:43,051
- No!
- Wait, what happened?

898
01:27:43,221 --> 01:27:44,552
- No!
- It's okay.

899
01:27:44,723 --> 01:27:46,088
No, not him.

900
01:27:46,258 --> 01:27:48,249
- Would you take her?
- Something's wrong.

901
01:29:37,135 --> 01:29:40,036
<i>He hasn't spoken to anybody
in three days.</i>

902
01:29:40,705 --> 01:29:42,366
Not a word.

903
01:29:42,674 --> 01:29:45,165
He won't eat, he won't sleep.

904
01:29:45,777 --> 01:29:47,836
I've never seen him like this.

905
01:29:48,013 --> 01:29:49,002
Never.

906
01:29:49,681 --> 01:29:51,581
Should I stay?

907
01:29:52,184 --> 01:29:54,311
With him, I mean?

908
01:29:56,121 --> 01:30:00,353
Listen, I'm not much
of a problem solver.

909
01:30:01,593 --> 01:30:06,155
Three decades,
I've only completed two sides.

910
01:30:06,331 --> 01:30:07,764
But I do know this much.

911
01:30:07,933 --> 01:30:10,163
If there's trouble...

912
01:30:10,335 --> 01:30:14,271
...all us freaks have is each other.

913
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:17,098
And I'm stuck here.

914
01:30:17,275 --> 01:30:18,902
So...

915
01:30:19,077 --> 01:30:22,478
...take care of the big monkey for me,
will you?

916
01:31:04,923 --> 01:31:08,916
I have accumulated many objects
of great interest...

917
01:31:09,094 --> 01:31:12,029
...preserving our heritage.

918
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:17,493
Many, like me,
believe Mother Russia...

919
01:31:17,669 --> 01:31:22,129
...to be very close
to a historic rebirth.

920
01:31:23,275 --> 01:31:24,902
"Rebirth"?

921
01:31:25,977 --> 01:31:28,002
I like that.

922
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:37,049
Twenty tons of stone.

923
01:31:37,222 --> 01:31:40,157
This thing fell from the sky
into Tunguska Forest.

924
01:31:40,325 --> 01:31:42,316
June 30th, 1908.

925
01:31:42,494 --> 01:31:45,657
The Romanovs took possession
of it immediately.

926
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:47,923
I've wanted it for ages.

927
01:31:48,099 --> 01:31:49,464
You're aware, of course...

928
01:31:49,634 --> 01:31:53,365
...there's no way you'll get it out
of Russian territory.

929
01:31:53,538 --> 01:31:57,975
He is aware.
Our guests are coming in.

930
01:31:58,310 --> 01:32:02,337
Volokolamsk Fields, 50 miles from
Moscow, that's where we're going.

931
01:32:02,514 --> 01:32:06,883
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
That's the only clue we have.

932
01:32:07,052 --> 01:32:09,748
We've collected
and destroyed thousands of eggs...

933
01:32:09,921 --> 01:32:13,880
...but we have no trace of this
Sammael or this Rasputin character.

934
01:32:14,059 --> 01:32:17,586
We leave as soon
as we get clearance and equipment.

935
01:32:17,762 --> 01:32:19,423
Hellboy's coming.

936
01:32:19,931 --> 01:32:22,957
I'm not pleased about that,
but I'll be in charge this time.

937
01:32:23,134 --> 01:32:27,628
We either wrap this up or I'm closing
this freak show for good.

938
01:32:37,849 --> 01:32:39,146
Hi.

939
01:32:39,484 --> 01:32:40,542
Hi.

940
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:47,051
I'll...

941
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:49,156
...come to Moscow...

942
01:32:49,327 --> 01:32:51,659
...if you're still going.

943
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:53,290
I am.

944
01:32:53,798 --> 01:32:56,198
But I have something to say.

945
01:32:58,670 --> 01:33:01,070
I understand
what you don't like about me.

946
01:33:01,239 --> 01:33:02,501
I do.

947
01:33:03,842 --> 01:33:05,332
What I am...

948
01:33:06,911 --> 01:33:09,471
...makes you feel
a little out of place...

949
01:33:09,948 --> 01:33:10,937
...out there.

950
01:33:11,116 --> 01:33:12,606
- Red, I don't...
- Listen.

951
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:16,653
I'm not like Myers.

952
01:33:17,889 --> 01:33:20,289
He makes you feel like you belong...

953
01:33:21,026 --> 01:33:22,653
...which is good, really.

954
01:33:29,534 --> 01:33:32,128
I wish I could do something about this.

955
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:36,004
I can't.

956
01:33:38,143 --> 01:33:40,509
I can promise you two things:

957
01:33:41,646 --> 01:33:44,137
One, I'll always look this good.

958
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:51,147
And two...

959
01:33:52,657 --> 01:33:54,557
...I'll never give up on you.

960
01:33:57,362 --> 01:33:58,488
Ever.

961
01:34:00,632 --> 01:34:02,190
I like that.

962
01:34:16,748 --> 01:34:20,343
This engraving here
represents Sammy. Text reads:

963
01:34:20,518 --> 01:34:25,046
"One falls, two shall arise. Sammael. "

964
01:34:26,925 --> 01:34:29,553
We'll have to nail them all at once,
and the eggs.

965
01:34:29,728 --> 01:34:31,753
And when we do, no mumbo jumbo.

966
01:34:33,131 --> 01:34:35,964
Double-core Vulcan-65 grenades.

967
01:34:36,134 --> 01:34:39,501
We've installed a handy little timer.
You set it, you walk away.

968
01:34:39,671 --> 01:34:41,571
Cable pulls the safety pins.

969
01:34:41,906 --> 01:34:42,895
Kaboom.

970
01:34:43,074 --> 01:34:45,167
Easy to clean, easy to use.

971
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:55,181
Sparky to Big Red.
Do you read me? Come in.

972
01:34:58,022 --> 01:34:59,319
"Sparky"?

973
01:34:59,491 --> 01:35:01,789
<i>Who came up with that? Myers?</i>

974
01:35:02,093 --> 01:35:05,119
<i>Yeah, we're leaving the main road,
so hang on.</i>

975
01:35:05,296 --> 01:35:07,321
This better be the place or I'll puke.

976
01:35:14,606 --> 01:35:16,198
You better come out and see.

977
01:35:28,853 --> 01:35:32,289
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

978
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,164
Forget it. We're never gonna find
Rasputin's mausoleum.

979
01:35:46,337 --> 01:35:48,771
It's practically a city.

980
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:51,238
And it stinks, and it's muddy.

981
01:35:51,409 --> 01:35:56,403
I think we go back, we check
into the hotel, we regroup.

982
01:35:56,581 --> 01:35:58,412
After breakfast.

983
01:35:58,583 --> 01:36:02,041
I think what we have to do here
is we have to make a grid.

984
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:07,317
We go in by quadrants.
Maybe satellite photography.

985
01:36:10,662 --> 01:36:12,721
Let me ask for directions.

986
01:36:14,933 --> 01:36:16,924
Where are you going?

987
01:36:27,312 --> 01:36:30,713
Come on, baby, find me a talker.

988
01:36:49,334 --> 01:36:50,494
Hi there.

989
01:37:11,122 --> 01:37:12,384
Come on.

990
01:37:13,524 --> 01:37:14,616
Come on.

991
01:37:15,526 --> 01:37:16,754
Come on.

992
01:37:20,365 --> 01:37:22,060
What do you want?

993
01:37:22,967 --> 01:37:24,764
This is ridiculous.

994
01:37:26,905 --> 01:37:28,429
I run this show, not him.

995
01:37:28,606 --> 01:37:30,335
This guy's nothing but trouble.

996
01:37:32,644 --> 01:37:35,112
- Ten minutes, we're out of here.
- Will you shut up...

997
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,248
...and let him do his thing?

998
01:37:37,415 --> 01:37:39,315
Anybody got a PowerBar?

999
01:37:42,186 --> 01:37:44,586
Hey, there he is.

1000
01:37:46,557 --> 01:37:48,957
Sixty feet further, comrades.

1001
01:37:49,894 --> 01:37:51,486
And three rows in.

1002
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:54,391
What the hell is that on his back?

1003
01:37:55,133 --> 01:37:57,863
This here is Ivan Klimentovich.

1004
01:37:58,069 --> 01:37:59,730
Say "hi," Ivan.

1005
01:38:00,004 --> 01:38:02,438
Go that way, Red Monkey!

1006
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:03,629
Gotcha.

1007
01:38:16,087 --> 01:38:18,920
Ivan says there's a whole network
of tunnels down here.

1008
01:38:19,090 --> 01:38:20,421
Goes on for miles.

1009
01:38:25,496 --> 01:38:28,021
Stay close, everybody.

1010
01:38:28,599 --> 01:38:30,260
You better be right about this.

1011
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:41,501
We'll be all right as long as
we don't separate.

1012
01:38:59,564 --> 01:39:01,555
Hey, Sparky.

1013
01:39:01,733 --> 01:39:05,362
Tell everyone to turn their locator
belts on. Anybody sees anything...

1014
01:39:05,536 --> 01:39:06,730
I'll say "Marco. "

1015
01:39:06,904 --> 01:39:07,928
Polo.

1016
01:39:08,373 --> 01:39:11,706
<i>- Are you sure about this?
- On a scale of one to ten: two.</i>

1017
01:39:12,276 --> 01:39:15,439
Don't worry, Boy Scout,
she'll take care of you.

1018
01:39:15,613 --> 01:39:17,274
<i>She's a tough one.</i>

1019
01:39:20,952 --> 01:39:22,010
Come on.

1020
01:39:32,897 --> 01:39:35,627
Ask your buddy
how far this thing goes.

1021
01:39:51,549 --> 01:39:53,449
How you doing up there, Ivan?

1022
01:39:53,851 --> 01:39:57,218
If I had legs I'd kick your ass!

1023
01:39:57,955 --> 01:40:00,981
Would you mind holding this guy
for a while? He is so negative.

1024
01:40:16,274 --> 01:40:17,605
What the hell is that?

1025
01:40:26,084 --> 01:40:27,608
Something big.

1026
01:40:27,785 --> 01:40:29,514
- Lime, come with me.
- Right.

1027
01:40:29,687 --> 01:40:32,952
No, no, no. Stay put!

1028
01:40:35,493 --> 01:40:37,154
Stop!

1029
01:40:37,829 --> 01:40:39,626
You listen to me.

1030
01:40:39,797 --> 01:40:40,855
Listen to me!

1031
01:40:41,933 --> 01:40:42,957
I'm in charge.

1032
01:40:43,134 --> 01:40:46,035
We're gonna go back.
You can take that door apart.

1033
01:40:46,204 --> 01:40:49,833
Whatever it is, it's coming for us.
Now, we gotta move forward!

1034
01:40:50,007 --> 01:40:51,338
Lime, let's go!

1035
01:40:51,509 --> 01:40:54,171
Stay put!

1036
01:40:55,446 --> 01:40:59,815
And you! I am not afraid of you!

1037
01:40:59,984 --> 01:41:02,748
I'm in charge! We go back!

1038
01:41:05,957 --> 01:41:10,724
I was better off dead!

1039
01:41:35,219 --> 01:41:36,379
Oh, crap.

1040
01:42:10,588 --> 01:42:12,419
Music.

1041
01:42:55,266 --> 01:42:56,290
Really went deep.

1042
01:43:02,807 --> 01:43:04,536
Hey, what's wrong with you?!

1043
01:43:28,165 --> 01:43:30,030
You killed my father.

1044
01:43:30,201 --> 01:43:31,429
Your ass is mine.

1045
01:43:43,547 --> 01:43:46,015
What are you laughing at,
you Nazi son of a...?

1046
01:44:11,942 --> 01:44:13,773
Don't even think about it.

1047
01:44:34,899 --> 01:44:37,697
That's all for you, pinhead.

1048
01:44:47,078 --> 01:44:48,705
What are you doing?

1049
01:44:48,879 --> 01:44:50,437
- What are you doing?
- Having a...

1050
01:44:50,614 --> 01:44:52,343
You never light a cigar that way.

1051
01:44:52,516 --> 01:44:53,983
You use a wooden match.

1052
01:44:56,354 --> 01:44:58,652
Preserves the flavor. You see?

1053
01:45:07,865 --> 01:45:09,423
Thank you.

1054
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,158
Thank you.

1055
01:45:17,708 --> 01:45:20,734
So he thinks you and I...

1056
01:45:22,179 --> 01:45:23,942
That's why he's mad at me.

1057
01:45:29,153 --> 01:45:32,281
But it's not true, right?

1058
01:45:34,091 --> 01:45:35,115
What?

1059
01:45:35,292 --> 01:45:38,523
Well, that, you know,
you feel that way about me.

1060
01:45:38,896 --> 01:45:42,127
You want to know that here? Now?

1061
01:45:46,837 --> 01:45:47,929
Yeah.

1062
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:53,134
Red, white, whatever.
Guys are all the same.

1063
01:45:56,113 --> 01:45:57,137
Hey, wait up.

1064
01:45:58,315 --> 01:46:00,078
<i>Have you found them yet?</i>

1065
01:46:00,251 --> 01:46:03,220
<i>I got them right below me.
It's a matter of minutes.</i>

1066
01:46:03,387 --> 01:46:05,014
Okay, good.

1067
01:46:06,724 --> 01:46:11,252
Could you hurry up?
Because it's a little spooky in here.

1068
01:46:12,029 --> 01:46:14,098
Liz, wait.

1069
01:46:17,101 --> 01:46:19,103
Oh, my God.

1070
01:46:20,104 --> 01:46:23,107
Let's back out real slow.

1071
01:46:40,491 --> 01:46:42,857
Myers, ready your grenades.

1072
01:46:44,428 --> 01:46:47,090
Marco. Marco. Marco.

1073
01:46:47,264 --> 01:46:49,926
Get your big, red butt over here.

1074
01:46:56,207 --> 01:46:57,469
I'm coming for you, kid!

1075
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:58,695
No piggybacks!

1076
01:48:03,641 --> 01:48:05,472
Get off me, you...

1077
01:48:09,046 --> 01:48:10,070
Liz, no!

1078
01:48:10,247 --> 01:48:13,080
They're gonna kill him!
Do something!

1079
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:14,683
What do you want me to do?

1080
01:48:14,852 --> 01:48:15,876
- Hit me.
- What?

1081
01:48:16,687 --> 01:48:18,052
Hit me.

1082
01:48:19,957 --> 01:48:20,946
Now!

1083
01:48:30,734 --> 01:48:32,964
You should be running.

1084
01:49:43,073 --> 01:49:44,938
They are all here.

1085
01:49:45,376 --> 01:49:46,900
All of them.

1086
01:49:47,411 --> 01:49:50,209
Just the way it was promised.

1087
01:49:53,917 --> 01:49:55,384
This one's awake.

1088
01:50:00,357 --> 01:50:02,848
Thank you for this.

1089
01:50:40,364 --> 01:50:41,956
"And I looked...

1090
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,702
...and beheld an angel.

1091
01:50:46,203 --> 01:50:51,208
And in his right hand,
the key to the bottomless pit. "

1092
01:50:53,711 --> 01:50:58,716
These were the words I heard
as a peasant boy in Tobolsk.

1093
01:50:58,751 --> 01:51:01,051
And now, the door.

1094
01:51:01,518 --> 01:51:03,748
Sent by the Ogdru Jahad...

1095
01:51:04,354 --> 01:51:09,621
...so that they might at long last
enter our world.

1096
01:51:09,793 --> 01:51:13,786
You are the key,
the right hand of doom.

1097
01:51:14,765 --> 01:51:16,426
Your stone hand.

1098
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:18,966
What did you think it was made for?

1099
01:51:20,971 --> 01:51:22,370
Open the locks.

1100
01:51:22,539 --> 01:51:24,166
Don't do it, Red! Don't do it!

1101
01:51:27,010 --> 01:51:28,272
Silence.

1102
01:51:30,981 --> 01:51:33,506
Imagine it.

1103
01:51:33,684 --> 01:51:35,777
An Eden...

1104
01:51:35,953 --> 01:51:37,477
...for you and her.

1105
01:51:37,688 --> 01:51:39,256
No.

1106
01:51:39,757 --> 01:51:41,258
No?

1107
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:45,262
In exchange for her soul, then?

1108
01:51:51,735 --> 01:51:52,895
Open the door.

1109
01:51:54,571 --> 01:51:56,163
No.

1110
01:51:56,974 --> 01:51:59,306
As you wish.

1111
01:52:00,811 --> 01:52:02,711
No!

1112
01:52:21,932 --> 01:52:23,229
Liz!

1113
01:52:32,009 --> 01:52:35,001
Her soul awaits on the other side.

1114
01:52:35,345 --> 01:52:37,313
If you want her back...

1115
01:52:37,481 --> 01:52:40,109
...open the door and claim her.

1116
01:52:44,254 --> 01:52:48,884
Your true name is inscribed
around the locks that hold you.

1117
01:52:49,059 --> 01:52:50,549
You cannot break them...

1118
01:52:50,727 --> 01:52:53,252
...no matter how strong you are.

1119
01:52:53,430 --> 01:52:55,421
The eclipse has begun.

1120
01:52:58,669 --> 01:53:00,500
Your true name...

1121
01:53:01,605 --> 01:53:03,266
...say it!

1122
01:53:10,247 --> 01:53:11,305
Become the key.

1123
01:53:20,424 --> 01:53:22,415
For her.

1124
01:53:23,827 --> 01:53:26,762
Anung un Rama.

1125
01:53:26,930 --> 01:53:28,557
Repeat it.

1126
01:53:28,732 --> 01:53:31,292
Anung un Rama.

1127
01:55:56,680 --> 01:55:58,944
Open the final lock.

1128
01:55:59,649 --> 01:56:02,345
Remember who you are!

1129
01:56:22,672 --> 01:56:25,835
Believe me, I have lived
long enough to know...

1130
01:56:26,009 --> 01:56:28,443
...not a tear will be shed
for this world!

1131
01:56:28,612 --> 01:56:30,136
You have a choice.

1132
01:56:30,313 --> 01:56:32,838
Your father gave you that.

1133
01:56:33,016 --> 01:56:34,347
No, you don't!

1134
01:56:34,518 --> 01:56:35,849
Open it!

1135
01:56:38,522 --> 01:56:40,114
Do it!

1136
01:57:04,281 --> 01:57:06,010
What have you done?

1137
01:57:08,151 --> 01:57:09,778
I chose.

1138
01:57:22,899 --> 01:57:25,527
You will never fulfill your destiny.

1139
01:57:25,702 --> 01:57:29,661
You will never understand
the power inside you.

1140
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:32,741
I'll just have to find a way
to live with that.

1141
01:57:44,321 --> 01:57:45,788
Child.

1142
01:57:45,956 --> 01:57:47,548
Look what you've done.

1143
01:57:48,325 --> 01:57:50,520
You've killed me...

1144
01:57:51,161 --> 01:57:53,026
...an insignificant man.

1145
01:57:53,196 --> 01:57:55,357
But you have brought forth...

1146
01:57:56,299 --> 01:57:58,233
...a god.

1147
01:58:06,543 --> 01:58:08,602
Myers, let's go.

1148
01:58:27,330 --> 01:58:30,231
Hell will hold no surprises for us.

1149
01:58:43,980 --> 01:58:45,971
I took a grenade belt.

1150
01:58:47,751 --> 01:58:49,878
The damn thing's broken.

1151
01:58:54,758 --> 01:58:56,919
Keep her safe, will you?

1152
01:58:57,093 --> 01:58:59,584
Whatever happens,
don't leave her alone.

1153
01:59:00,230 --> 01:59:01,288
I won't.

1154
01:59:09,339 --> 01:59:11,136
You're okay, Myers.

1155
01:59:12,042 --> 01:59:13,509
Stick around.

1156
01:59:14,144 --> 01:59:15,907
Hey, Red.

1157
01:59:19,316 --> 01:59:20,749
Just pull the cable.

1158
01:59:20,917 --> 01:59:22,316
I didn't get you anything.

1159
01:59:24,254 --> 01:59:27,417
Are you going to be okay alone?

1160
01:59:30,493 --> 01:59:32,154
How big can it be?

1161
01:59:39,936 --> 01:59:41,096
Damn!

1162
01:59:58,688 --> 01:59:59,780
Damn.

1163
02:00:49,105 --> 02:00:50,697
Oh, this is gonna hurt.

1164
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:22,597
Gonna be sore in the morning.

1165
02:01:42,425 --> 02:01:44,154
She's got no pulse.

1166
02:01:45,295 --> 02:01:46,956
She's not breathing.

1167
02:01:57,907 --> 02:01:59,306
Liz?

1168
02:01:59,642 --> 02:02:01,940
I was so foolish.

1169
02:02:33,977 --> 02:02:35,274
Red.

1170
02:02:42,552 --> 02:02:44,213
In the dark...

1171
02:02:47,791 --> 02:02:49,850
...I heard your voice.

1172
02:02:54,697 --> 02:02:56,460
What did you say?

1173
02:02:58,568 --> 02:03:00,126
I said, "Hey...

1174
02:03:01,037 --> 02:03:03,267
...you on the other side...

1175
02:03:05,108 --> 02:03:06,769
...let her go.

1176
02:03:08,611 --> 02:03:10,135
Because for...

1177
02:03:17,086 --> 02:03:19,418
For her I'll cross over.

1178
02:03:22,826 --> 02:03:25,488
And then you'll be sorry. "

1179
02:03:45,982 --> 02:03:48,576
<i>What makes a man a man?</i>

1180
02:03:48,885 --> 02:03:51,547
<i>A friend of mine once wondered.</i>

1181
02:03:52,188 --> 02:03:56,249
<i>Is it his origins?
The way he comes to life?</i>

1182
02:03:56,726 --> 02:03:58,557
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1183
02:03:58,728 --> 02:04:00,662
<i>It's the choices he makes.</i>

1184
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:03,128
<i>Not how he starts things...</i>

1185
02:04:03,299 --> 02:04:06,427
<i>...but how he decides to end them.</i>

1186
02:06:14,330 --> 02:06:17,424
Hey, guys? I'm still here.

1187
02:06:20,570 --> 02:06:21,901
Hello?
