1
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:02,664
Subject's name is John Kramer.

2
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:06,281
52 year old. A male. Caucasian.

3
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:09,571
I've seen better days.

4
00:02:50,686 --> 00:02:53,049
Some kind of backdoor brain surgery.

5
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:25,217
Let's check the stomach.

6
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:46,699
What the hell...

7
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:51,506
Get homicide here. Now!

8
00:05:00,113 --> 00:05:01,888
Where is it?

9
00:05:02,704 --> 00:05:04,174
It's in his stomach.

10
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:06,646
Cut it out.

11
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,319
Are you there, Detective?

12
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,206
If so, you're probably the last man standing.

13
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:51,661
Now, perhaps you will succeed where the others
have failed.

14
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:55,369
You think you will walk away untested?

15
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,634
I promise that my work will continue.

16
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:02,976
You think it's over just because I'm dead?

17
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:03,977
It's not over. The games have just begun.

18
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:45,460
Who's there?

19
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:48,417
Talk to me.

20
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:50,092
Talk to me!

21
00:07:04,436 --> 00:07:05,464
Talk to me!!!...

22
00:07:13,276 --> 00:07:14,597
Stop it!

23
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:17,655
Stop...

24
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:25,560
Stop it!

25
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:58,270
Who's doing this to me?!

26
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:14,829
Just stay away from me!!!

27
00:08:21,382 --> 00:08:22,077
What'd I do?

28
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:54,115
Right side clear. Left side clear.

29
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:54,928
Clear.

30
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,150
In position.

31
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:02,054
Standing by.

32
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,640
Alright then.

33
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:07,298
It seem open.

34
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:13,801
We have device.

35
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:16,096
You get eyes in there before you go in.

36
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:16,996
Get some eyes in here.

37
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,283
Hurry now.

38
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,385
Doorway's clear.

39
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:15,054
It's Kerry, bitch.

40
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,151
Rigg, don't do that.

41
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,394
Rigg, I said no!!!

42
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,888
Kerry!!!

43
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:19,758
Stop it!!!

44
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,184
You're not going through that door.

45
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:22,974
Kerry!!!

46
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:24,959
Shit...

47
00:11:33,951 --> 00:11:34,765
Oh shit...

48
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:51,533
Give me the Coroner's office.

49
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:52,197
Copy.

50
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:53,819
Somebody get those rats off her.

51
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:05,949
Cut her down.

52
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:08,539
You know I can't do that.

53
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:15,597
Just cut her down, please.

54
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:25,687
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

55
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:29,942
You know never to go through
an unsecured door, ever.

56
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:31,912
Thought she was still alive.

57
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:33,693
Thought I could save her.

58
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:39,049
Did you ever think that we would've
end up here, for a starter?

59
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:42,432
No.

60
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,148
Didn't see it happening like this.

61
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,460
Why the hell are you still talking?

62
00:12:50,461 --> 00:12:51,900
Sir I need you to save her.

63
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,113
That's what we do.

64
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:58,420
Right, cherish your life.

65
00:12:59,114 --> 00:12:59,808
What?

66
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:03,208
The fucking motto. We're supposed to
cherish our lives.

67
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:07,156
But how the hell are we supposed to
do that when this is our life?

68
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:15,207
We chose this. You go home.

69
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,508
... is here to see you

70
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:17,135
Copy.

71
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:23,305
- Detective Hoffman.
- Yeah?

72
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:27,791
I'm Special Agent Lindsey Perez. This is
Special Agent Peter Strahm.

73
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:30,551
How can I help the FBI?

74
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:33,484
We're here about Detective Kerry. She
was our liaison.

75
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:35,495
Open the door. You will find me.

76
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:36,733
What?

77
00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:43,758
What's this?

78
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,658
The key that came from our last
message from Detective Kerry.

79
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,030
"Open the door and you will find me"
mean anything to you?

80
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:49,631
No.

81
00:13:58,692 --> 00:14:00,192
Where's the body?

82
00:14:00,592 --> 00:14:04,151
Crime scene photographer's flash
picked up this bullet casing.

83
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:06,477
It was lodged between the body
and the device.

84
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,691
Run it for prints.

85
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:17,670
Give us a minute would you?
Thanks.

86
00:14:24,105 --> 00:14:25,425
The lock wasn't opened.

87
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:27,013
She couldn't get out.

88
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:31,218
It was constructed for her execution.
It betrayed the rules.

89
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,750
Not a Jigsaw trap then.

90
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:33,277
No.

91
00:14:33,978 --> 00:14:35,491
Amanda Young, the accomplice, did this.

92
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:36,592
This wasn't done by Amanda Young.

93
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,188
Excuse me?

94
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:43,153
Detective Kerry weighed approximate 130lbs.
Amanda Young's arrest report has her at 107lbs.

95
00:14:43,154 --> 00:14:44,554
She couldn't get her up there alone.

96
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:44,855
John Kramer was.

97
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:46,090
Bedridden cancer patient?

98
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:47,091
He's brains. Not brawn.

99
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:49,799
He was also an engineer. He could've
rigged pulley's that...

100
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,955
...or. Someone else could've helped him.

101
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:55,736
Special Agent, if you're here for any other
reason than just to assist.

102
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:58,358
We're here to find the person your
department couldn't, Detective.

103
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:00,471
The one helping Jigsaw and Amanda Young.

104
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:02,625
Excuse me.

105
00:15:09,094 --> 00:15:11,189
We found a ??? in your possession.

106
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:12,500
What's that about?

107
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:13,444
A toy.

108
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,524
Kids play with toys in the holidays.

109
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:18,382
How about the tricycle?

110
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,735
The tricycle's from John's youth...

111
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,895
A grown man has a tricycle his whole life?

112
00:15:25,857 --> 00:15:28,266
I'm sure you've kept things that
were important to you.

113
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:33,482
Look, Ms. Tuck. Is there any reason we should
be concerned with your safety?

114
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:36,262
Perhaps, you should be more
concerned with yourself.

115
00:15:36,263 --> 00:15:39,663
Why don't you tell me everything you know about
John and let's start at the beginning.

116
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:42,174
John's life defines pretty much it......??????

117
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:47,018
So, why don't we start at the end and
let's work our way backwards.

118
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,419
I represent Mrs. Tuck.

119
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,900
She knows something.

120
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:56,936
I thought you were going home.
You have a vacation time, right?

121
00:15:56,937 --> 00:15:57,937
Take it.

122
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:01,185
Finish the remodeling. Spend
some time with Tracy.

123
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:02,186
She understands.

124
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:03,862
Then, don't take it for granted.

125
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:06,410
Eric is still out there man.

126
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:09,391
Eric's been missing for six months. Kerry's
was gone for four days.

127
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:12,342
I can only be as optimistic as the facts allow.

128
00:16:12,343 --> 00:16:13,654
Yeah. Well I'm in it until I find him.

129
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,469
Finding his body's not going to vindicate us.

130
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,381
Finding him alive will.

131
00:16:17,382 --> 00:16:19,356
It's time to let go.

132
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,852
I want you to go home.

133
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:24,220
I'll call you later to make sure
everything's okay.

134
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:30,695
Who's he?

135
00:16:30,696 --> 00:16:32,595
Lieutenant Rigg, our SWAT commander.

136
00:16:32,596 --> 00:16:33,848
What's his problem?

137
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:35,734
Everyone around him keeps dying.

138
00:16:57,376 --> 00:16:58,326
What's it say?

139
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:09,111
It says I tried calling you four times. It says dinner is
in fridge and at the bottom it says I love you.

140
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:17,694
I need to help my mum for a few
days. Just come with me.

141
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:20,713
No, I can't.

142
00:17:22,365 --> 00:17:26,196
You can't or you won't?

143
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:32,553
What you can't do is save everyone.

144
00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:42,338
Tracy...

145
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:45,586
Tracy, please listen to me...

146
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:02,442
John Kramer owned a company called
The Urban Renewal.

147
00:18:03,557 --> 00:18:04,787
No irony in that, huh?

148
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:06,496
What was Rigg watching?

149
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:09,695
Jill Tuck's interrogation.
She was Jigsaw's ex.

150
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:10,509
It's old.

151
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,637
Why's a SWAT guy watching that?

152
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:18,789
What's wrong? I really think we should tell Hoffman
what Detective Kerry said in her last message.

153
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,589
She said two officers might be in danger but
until we know who we're not causing any panic...

154
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:27,267
If Detective Hoffman or anyone else in this precinct
is in danger I think they should know it.

155
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:28,377
That's your call.

156
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:33,824
Making any progress?

157
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:37,860
We're fine. Thanks.

158
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:41,023
Hey Ross. Looks like another doctor went
missing from the hospital.

159
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:42,523
You think maybe its uh...

160
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:44,037
...Connected? Let's check it out.

161
00:18:45,314 --> 00:18:48,164
If you need me, call my cell. Coffee
machine's around the corner.

162
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:49,012
Boy or girl?

163
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,123
Girl?

164
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:52,101
I didn't know you were married.

165
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:54,091
I'm not. It's a short story, believe me.

166
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:13,349
Tracy?

167
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:30,567
Tracy?

168
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:40,597
Yeah?

169
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:42,724
The print off that casing.

170
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,340
We got a match.

171
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:45,341
Jesus.

172
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:46,903
Rechecked this?

173
00:20:46,904 --> 00:20:47,896
Twice.

174
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:29,792
Hello, Officer Rigg.

175
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:31,998
Welcome to your rebirth.

176
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:37,976
For years, you stood by and witnessed as
your colleagues have fallen.

177
00:21:38,077 --> 00:21:42,794
You have remained untouched while
Eric Matthews has disappeared.

178
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:45,646
But with your survival came your obsession.

179
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:50,213
Obsession to stop those around you from
making the wrong choices.

180
00:21:50,214 --> 00:21:53,326
Thus, preventing you from making the right ones.

181
00:21:53,327 --> 00:21:55,066
You wanted to save everyone.

182
00:21:55,152 --> 00:21:58,905
Tonight, I give you the opportunity to face your obsession.

183
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:03,642
Look closely. Eric Matthews is still alive.

184
00:22:04,378 --> 00:22:07,476
The block of ice he stands upon on is melting.

185
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:11,260
He has but ninety minutes to save himself.

186
00:22:11,674 --> 00:22:15,498
Detective Hoffman's fate is linked to that ???

187
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:18,488
Heed my warning, Officer Rigg.

188
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:22,631
Their lives hang in the balance of your obsession.

189
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:26,368
Will you learn how to let go
and truly save them?

190
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:28,626
The choice is yours.

191
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:23,956
Take off the mask and put your hands in the air.

192
00:23:23,957 --> 00:23:26,275
I can't remove...

193
00:23:38,492 --> 00:23:43,996
Officer Rigg, your first test. The person in front
of you is in desperate need of help.

194
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:46,246
But it is not your job to save them.

195
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:50,706
You view this person as a victim but
if you were to see what I see.

196
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:55,558
Beneath the mask lies a criminal
undeserving of the life she leads.

197
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:08,397
Your obsession tells you to save the victim,
I tell you to walk away. The choice is yours.

198
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:11,456
Are you a cop?

199
00:24:11,457 --> 00:24:12,216
What?

200
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:13,217
Are you a cop?!

201
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,318
Yeah. I'm a cop.

202
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:18,927
What is that?!!

203
00:24:19,228 --> 00:24:20,508
What're you doing?!!!

204
00:24:26,913 --> 00:24:27,901
Get me out!!

205
00:24:29,365 --> 00:24:30,404
They're in the gears.

206
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:31,448
What's in the gears?

207
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:33,419
Combination. Get me out!

208
00:24:36,747 --> 00:24:39,582
Just get me out!

209
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:40,583
Alright. Relax!

210
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:41,584
Hurry!

211
00:24:42,894 --> 00:24:44,576
Just get me outta here, please!!!

212
00:24:48,765 --> 00:24:50,788
Please. Where are you going?!

213
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:56,277
Shit.

214
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,611
Stop!!!

215
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,424
Shit.

216
00:25:36,747 --> 00:25:37,638
I got one.

217
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:40,075
I got one!

218
00:25:41,613 --> 00:25:42,726
Hold on. Hold on.

219
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:43,926
Hurry!!!...

220
00:25:51,203 --> 00:25:52,199
Hold on. Hold on.

221
00:25:52,724 --> 00:25:54,186
I got it, 617.

222
00:25:54,187 --> 00:25:55,069
617!

223
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:12,369
Ok, listen. Stay here.

224
00:26:12,677 --> 00:26:13,823
Don't touch anything.

225
00:26:36,744 --> 00:26:37,547
What the fuck...

226
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,151
What the fuck you doing?

227
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:44,493
What you doing? Drop the
fucking knife...

228
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:46,519
Put the knife down.

229
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,800
Put the knife down!

230
00:26:48,463 --> 00:26:50,234
I just saved your fucking life!

231
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:06,331
The prints just came in. They're from
Officer Rigg.

232
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:08,782
- Fisk...
- Not now.

233
00:27:08,817 --> 00:27:11,400
We just got a call. A shot's fired from 23 Park Place.

234
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,171
That's Rigg's apartment.

235
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:24,460
Hello, Brenda. I want to play a game.

236
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,357
An officer will try to save you.

237
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,836
If he is successful, then your game begins.

238
00:27:31,837 --> 00:27:36,842
This man will use these photos to sentence
you for your crimes.

239
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:41,430
And the only way to stop him is
taped underneath the TV.

240
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:47,905
Let him save your life and accept
your fate to rot in prison...

241
00:27:47,906 --> 00:27:52,033
...or kill him and guarantee your freedom.

242
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:54,191
Make your choice.

243
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,154
<i>I'll fucking kill you, you fucking bitch!</i>

244
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:25,891
It's started.

245
00:30:28,048 --> 00:30:31,135
??? for Rigg. Everybody's looking.

246
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:32,627
He has a wife. Where is she?

247
00:30:32,628 --> 00:30:33,966
We haven't located her yet.

248
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:34,890
Strahm...

249
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:38,812
Two detectives. You see these?

250
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,432
- Hoffman.....????..
- Not yet.

251
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,027
- Hoffman...
- Calling.

252
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:46,835
How do you explain Detective Matthews?

253
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:48,174
He's alive.

254
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:50,835
Six months, Jigsaw never kept anyone that long.

255
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:52,212
No one but Amanda Young.

256
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,012
You think he's been fixed.

257
00:30:55,013 --> 00:30:57,344
Why these six?

258
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,908
Hoffman's a ????? lieutenant. He
doesn't fit the profile.

259
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:06,195
That's what you see. But
what does he see.

260
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:09,847
Rigg tried to save his two friends.

261
00:31:09,848 --> 00:31:12,892
Maybe. We got names and locations
on any of these people?

262
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:13,620
Working it.

263
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:17,031
This is overkill. It's a setup to
announce Rigg as the accomplice.

264
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,320
Or a setup for his alibi.

265
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:21,931
Everyone around him keeps dying but
where is he to tell us his innocence...

266
00:31:21,932 --> 00:31:24,234
...or what the hell these photos
are doing in his apartment.

267
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:24,956
Look there.

268
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:27,847
Lamp???? please.

269
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,534
Four walls build a home.

270
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:34,508
What does he want us to see on these walls?

271
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:35,722
The victims?

272
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:38,461
One of these pictures doesn't belong.

273
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:47,953
This is who we're looking for.

274
00:31:49,494 --> 00:31:50,959
Lets talk to her now.

275
00:31:57,233 --> 00:31:58,858
Jill Tuck, where is she?

276
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,879
Have them turn off the air in there.

277
00:32:17,658 --> 00:32:18,551
Ms. Tuck.

278
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,877
I'm Special Agent Perez. This
is Special Agent Strahm.

279
00:32:21,878 --> 00:32:24,357
I'd like to apologize for pulling you
out of your place at work.

280
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:26,160
What more do you think I can offer you?

281
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:29,086
My hundred hours of interrogation tapes...

282
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:33,301
...and the volumes of evidence taken
from my house (???)

283
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:38,455
Actually, it's not John we wanna talk
about, Ms. Tuck? It's you.

284
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:42,238
Me? Why'd you wanna talk about me?
This isn't about me.

285
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:46,189
So stop wasting both of our time and get to
the real reason why you brought me here.

286
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,560
A little help...

287
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:23,927
Hey!

288
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:27,519
You hear me?!

289
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,797
You fucking hear me, you fucking motherfucker?!

290
00:33:55,614 --> 00:33:58,640
What the fuck are you looking at, huh?!

291
00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:01,042
Hey, you!

292
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:06,420
Sir, sir, can I help you?

293
00:35:13,762 --> 00:35:15,492
Hello, Officer Rigg.

294
00:35:15,493 --> 00:35:19,284
In order for you to fully understand
my way, you must...

295
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:21,596
...Feel what I feel.

296
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:26,759
The photo before you is of a man in
desperate need of help.

297
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,430
In the next room are the tools to his salvation.

298
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:33,980
His life is in your hands.

299
00:35:34,181 --> 00:35:37,938
But in the end, only he can save himself.

300
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:43,084
Be careful. There are camera's watching.

301
00:35:44,385 --> 00:35:47,190
And you must hide your identity.

302
00:35:49,091 --> 00:35:50,695
Make your choice.

303
00:35:54,438 --> 00:35:58,463
Ok. Four walls build a home.

304
00:35:58,498 --> 00:36:01,811
- Care to shed any light on that?
- Light on what?

305
00:36:01,812 --> 00:36:04,461
On what your photos are doing at
the crime scene?

306
00:36:07,462 --> 00:36:09,780
Four walls build a home.
Ring any bells?

307
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:13,040
Cherish your life?

308
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:19,221
Cherish your life is the concept that
this whole clinic was built on.

309
00:36:19,222 --> 00:36:20,340
Cherish your life.

310
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:21,318
Your life.

311
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:22,411
That's his motto.

312
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:23,512
No. It's your motto.

313
00:36:24,137 --> 00:36:25,386
The clinic you run.

314
00:36:27,328 --> 00:36:30,600
Fuck, bitch! I've been here for
three fucking hours!!!

315
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:32,237
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shut up!

316
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:33,238
Hey ????

317
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,191
Stop it.

318
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:42,205
Stop it!

319
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:51,772
You don't wanna do that.

320
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:53,031
What the fuck's your problem?

321
00:36:53,066 --> 00:36:54,040
You're my problem.

322
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,554
And you're becoming everybody else's too.

323
00:37:05,482 --> 00:37:06,449
How do you feel?

324
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:13,761
About a husband who takes a motto from your
drug clinic designed to help people...

325
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:18,083
...and twist it into some manic torture mantra.

326
00:37:18,084 --> 00:37:20,583
That part of John has nothing to do with me.

327
00:37:24,364 --> 00:37:25,576
Look, Ms. Tuck.

328
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,992
I just left a room with more blood on the walls
and pain two officers are missing,...

329
00:37:29,993 --> 00:37:35,489
...and there's a growing pile of bodies in their wake
and every detail we unearth about your...

330
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,288
- ...hall of fame psychopath husband...
- Ex.

331
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:43,568
...points to you as a possible accomplice.
I'm just curious as to why.

332
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:48,667
You know there's a lot of people out
there looking for answers.

333
00:37:48,702 --> 00:37:53,957
Want to place blame on someone.
That person is you.

334
00:37:54,158 --> 00:37:55,949
But you know what the best part is.

335
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:59,768
I don't have to convince everybody.
Just 12 people.

336
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,426
Ok, tell me about his workshop.

337
00:38:11,891 --> 00:38:14,007
Stay there.
Let me get the lights.

338
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:19,599
- Wow, it's big.
- Yeah.

339
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,330
This is exactly what you've been looking for.

340
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:24,119
Nice, huh?

341
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,967
Tada.

342
00:38:26,668 --> 00:38:28,628
This is the clock?

343
00:38:29,129 --> 00:38:30,628
What's so special about it?

344
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:32,584
Except for the fact the whole deal hung out.

345
00:38:32,954 --> 00:38:36,451
The mechanism inside is 300 years old.

346
00:38:37,252 --> 00:38:38,560
It's still ticking.

347
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:40,775
It stood the test of time.

348
00:38:44,548 --> 00:38:46,171
Well, you see this space.

349
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,983
I got a surprise for you.

350
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,113
Why are you doing this?

351
00:39:13,314 --> 00:39:13,895
Why?

352
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:22,154
This is a mistake and it happened
a long time ago.

353
00:39:22,217 --> 00:39:23,970
And I... I paid for this.

354
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:26,336
Just let me go, okay?

355
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,296
What's behind the door?

356
00:39:32,388 --> 00:39:34,909
One saves lives. One takes it away.

357
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,046
Try and enter the door.

358
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,062
Terrific.

359
00:39:45,487 --> 00:39:46,107
Oh no...

360
00:39:46,252 --> 00:39:47,002
Get back! Get back!

361
00:39:47,336 --> 00:39:49,123
Let's go. Go!

362
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,026
Eric...

363
00:40:24,061 --> 00:40:25,065
Jesus...

364
00:40:25,266 --> 00:40:27,047
Help, help me!!!

365
00:40:27,348 --> 00:40:28,328
Get away from there.

366
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:31,142
What do you know about the guy in the TV?

367
00:40:31,143 --> 00:40:31,785
What?

368
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:32,872
What do you know about Eric Matthews?!

369
00:40:32,873 --> 00:40:33,984
I don't know who that is.

370
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,002
Do you know what this is?

371
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:39,089
I don't know.

372
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:43,775
What are you gonna do to me?

373
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:54,183
If you are playing this tape, then you are one step closer
 to truly understanding how to save a life.

374
00:40:54,184 --> 00:41:01,968
As an officer of the law, you find yourself torn ???? 
your victims or perpetrator of violence.

375
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:05,037
You sick fuck.

376
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,766
His salvation is out of your hands.

377
00:41:10,157 --> 00:41:14,201
It is your choice if you wish to put it into his own.

378
00:41:14,202 --> 00:41:20,999
Once this lesson is learnt, you will find yourself one 
step closer to truly saving Eric Matthews.

379
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,724
Without you, this man's game cannot begin. 
Force him into position to face his demon.

380
00:41:27,978 --> 00:41:30,269
And let him make the decision.

381
00:41:41,095 --> 00:41:42,377
What the fuck?

382
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,756
Is this what you do ????

383
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:45,560
No.

384
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:50,047
Get on the fucking bed.

385
00:41:50,713 --> 00:41:52,462
Get on the bed! Move!

386
00:41:57,733 --> 00:42:00,270
I don't know. I know I was wrong.

387
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:00,807
I know.

388
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:03,832
Hurry up!

389
00:42:04,477 --> 00:42:05,298
Hurry up!

390
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:07,070
Put your fucking hands in.

391
00:42:09,252 --> 00:42:13,193
I don't know. Sir, untie me.

392
00:42:20,586 --> 00:42:22,421
What does that say?

393
00:42:37,195 --> 00:42:38,355
Hello Ivan.

394
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:42,459
As a voyeur, you have kept photos of 
those you have victimized.

395
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,447
Don't let him do this!

396
00:42:44,617 --> 00:42:46,598
Can you see the pain you have brought them?

397
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:49,231
You have torn apart their lives.

398
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:53,060
You've used your body as an instrument of abuse.

399
00:42:53,843 --> 00:42:57,901
Now I give you the chance to decide 
what is more important.

400
00:42:58,695 --> 00:43:01,524
Your eyes which have led you blindly astray.

401
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:08,570
Or your body which has caused 
those around you endless suffering.

402
00:43:09,403 --> 00:43:12,618
You've been handed the tools 
which can save your life.

403
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,160
Decide quickly though.

404
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:19,040
In sixty seconds, the choice will 
be made for you.

405
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:06,223
You're gonna have to tell me how you got 
those bruises on your hand and your neck.

406
00:44:07,747 --> 00:44:10,192
Was this an accident or did 
someone do this to you?

407
00:44:11,759 --> 00:44:14,692
You know you can stop it from 
happening if you tell me the truth.

408
00:44:17,134 --> 00:44:18,394
Take a seat.

409
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,526
I wanna go home now.

410
00:44:26,114 --> 00:44:27,483
Son of a bitch is lying.

411
00:44:28,148 --> 00:44:30,171
He's done this before. 
She's allowed it.

412
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:32,827
The child's story doesn't (???)

413
00:44:32,862 --> 00:44:33,795
What can I do?

414
00:44:34,396 --> 00:44:36,590
Jane, can't let you go home 
right now, okay?

415
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,147
You're going back to class now.

416
00:44:38,148 --> 00:44:42,125
Don't you officers sympathise these kids?
It's getting out of control.

417
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:43,937
Take your hands off me.

418
00:44:43,938 --> 00:44:44,837
Hey, take it easy.

419
00:44:45,513 --> 00:44:47,267
Rigg! Rigg!

420
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,202
No.

421
00:44:48,203 --> 00:44:50,455
Get out now!

422
00:44:50,456 --> 00:44:52,362
You just made the biggest mistake of your life.

423
00:44:52,881 --> 00:44:53,604
You hear me!

424
00:44:58,906 --> 00:45:00,611
That's sweet, Ms. Tuck.

425
00:45:00,612 --> 00:45:03,252
But if you love the guy so much, 
why leave him?

426
00:45:03,253 --> 00:45:05,526
He left me long before I left him.

427
00:45:05,527 --> 00:45:07,169
Okay. People break up.
 Relationships end.

428
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,333
It's called life.

429
00:45:08,334 --> 00:45:11,065
I mean, he started massacring people.

430
00:45:11,066 --> 00:45:12,266
He didn't move everything ???????

431
00:45:13,049 --> 00:45:13,843
I'm sorry who?

432
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:16,854
Do you know anything about the Chinese zodiac?

433
00:45:16,855 --> 00:45:18,850
Aww, Jill. No, no.

434
00:45:18,851 --> 00:45:22,612
I didn't just get pregnant. 
It was carefully planned.

435
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:25,450
Everything in John was.

436
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:30,413
- See you.
- Thanks.

437
00:45:30,753 --> 00:45:31,617
- Buhbye.
- Bye.

438
00:45:31,618 --> 00:45:33,652
- Let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

439
00:45:36,222 --> 00:45:38,679
-Thanks. You too. Good night.
- Good night.

440
00:45:43,955 --> 00:45:46,638
Hey honey. You want some company?

441
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:47,505
What are you doing?

442
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,526
You know what this building is?

443
00:45:54,608 --> 00:45:55,588
It's a health clinic.

444
00:45:56,899 --> 00:45:58,888
You're a beautiful girl. Go home.

445
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:09,401
I forgot my jacket.

446
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:10,174
Cecil...

447
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:12,174
Oh, please, please, Jill. 
Jill, it's right there.

448
00:46:12,175 --> 00:46:14,683
It's right there. Please, please.
Come on.

449
00:46:16,557 --> 00:46:17,486
Thank you.

450
00:46:30,648 --> 00:46:31,317
What are you doing?

451
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:32,445
I'm not gonna hurt you, alright.

452
00:46:32,683 --> 00:46:34,194
If you don't grab that fucking door.

453
00:46:34,195 --> 00:46:36,273
Open that fucking door. Open!

454
00:46:36,925 --> 00:46:37,664
Open...

455
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:40,034
Fuck!

456
00:46:40,735 --> 00:46:42,096
What fucking key?!

457
00:46:42,097 --> 00:46:42,960
What key?!

458
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:45,029
Fuck!

459
00:46:48,171 --> 00:46:49,287
Fucking stay there.

460
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,317
Cecil...

461
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,536
I need some help here.

462
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:37,753
Orderly!

463
00:47:38,867 --> 00:47:40,534
This is my wife. She's hurt.

464
00:47:40,535 --> 00:47:41,462
How far long is she?

465
00:47:41,663 --> 00:47:42,574
7 months.

466
00:48:24,503 --> 00:48:26,386
All I wanted to do was help them.

467
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:29,644
You can't help them.

468
00:48:31,824 --> 00:48:33,382
They have to help themselves.

469
00:48:44,763 --> 00:48:46,772
Okay. Let's review.

470
00:48:48,082 --> 00:48:51,414
Girl loves boy. Boy loves girl. 
Boy gets girl pregnant.

471
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:57,215
Girl loses baby. Boy turns
 into a serial killer.

472
00:48:57,216 --> 00:48:59,793
Jill, I'm not buying it.

473
00:49:03,321 --> 00:49:04,902
Alright. She doesn't leave.

474
00:49:17,256 --> 00:49:21,498
Been identified as Ivan (Landice???), 
??? rape three times.

475
00:49:22,158 --> 00:49:25,067
Had to gouge out his own eyes 
in order to release himself.

476
00:49:26,555 --> 00:49:29,183
How does something like this get 
into a motel room undetected?

477
00:49:29,564 --> 00:49:30,498
Piece by piece.

478
00:49:31,321 --> 00:49:34,792
The room's been rented for the past six 
days to a lawyer named Art Blanc.

479
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:36,844
Get this. He went missing two weeks ago.

480
00:49:36,845 --> 00:49:38,309
We got his name. Get his addresses.

481
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,996
Two out of five people in Officer Rigg's 
apartment walls are dead.

482
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:45,308
Every partner he's ever worked with...
dead.

483
00:49:45,309 --> 00:49:46,718
Rigg didn't kill Ivan.

484
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:48,093
Ivan made his own choice.

485
00:49:48,094 --> 00:49:50,268
Isn't that the whole Jigsaw mantra?

486
00:49:50,269 --> 00:49:51,805
This wasn't about Ivan. It wasn't his test.

487
00:49:52,206 --> 00:49:53,383
This is about Rigg.

488
00:49:55,475 --> 00:49:57,292
Look at these photos. Tell me 
how you feel.

489
00:49:57,293 --> 00:49:59,922
- Look at these women and tell me how you feel.
- Angry.

490
00:49:59,923 --> 00:50:00,485
Enraged.

491
00:50:00,486 --> 00:50:01,421
Exactly.

492
00:50:02,275 --> 00:50:03,912
The pimp. The rapist.

493
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:05,762
Jigsaw wanted Rigg to see what he sees.

494
00:50:05,763 --> 00:50:08,422
He wants him to feel what he feels.

495
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:11,362
This wasn't about Rigg saving his friends.

496
00:50:12,026 --> 00:50:13,435
He's being recruited.

497
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:14,903
Thanks.

498
00:50:15,552 --> 00:50:17,112
Art Blanc's got a bunch of properties.

499
00:50:17,113 --> 00:50:19,595
The last known address is a couple 
of blocks from here.

500
00:50:26,428 --> 00:50:28,720
- Right side clear.
- Left side clear.

501
00:50:29,507 --> 00:50:30,795
- Clear.
- Clear.

502
00:50:31,096 --> 00:50:31,860
Clear.

503
00:50:51,955 --> 00:50:53,325
What does this mean?

504
00:50:54,526 --> 00:50:56,590
We're the two Jigsaw targets.

505
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,655
Fuck you.

506
00:51:18,815 --> 00:51:19,463
Hey.

507
00:51:21,395 --> 00:51:22,532
Hey.

508
00:51:23,745 --> 00:51:24,840
Hey...

509
00:51:41,927 --> 00:51:44,318
You jump off that block, you electrocute him.

510
00:51:44,653 --> 00:51:47,357
If that ice had melted more, he'd be fried.

511
00:51:47,558 --> 00:51:48,510
You understand?

512
00:51:48,511 --> 00:51:49,310
Listen to him.

513
00:51:59,512 --> 00:52:02,180
- You just made the biggest mistake of your life.
- Calm down.

514
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:04,636
- Cocksucker!
- I'll get somebody to take a look at it, alright?

515
00:52:04,837 --> 00:52:08,454
My client has a broken nose and a 
fractured cheek bone.

516
00:52:08,455 --> 00:52:12,035
Administrative leave with pays (not???) except...

517
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,974
The IA investigation's under way.

518
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:19,976
Into this precinct, wow. What's 
that gonna get me, huh?

519
00:52:19,977 --> 00:52:20,566
The truth.

520
00:52:20,567 --> 00:52:22,271
The truth. Well, I'll tell you 
what the truth is.

521
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,646
The truth is I have an eyewitness.

522
00:52:24,647 --> 00:52:29,171
The man's wife? She stands to gain as much as he does 
if there were to be a financial settlement.

523
00:52:29,172 --> 00:52:31,095
Which is not gonna happen because he's lying.

524
00:52:31,396 --> 00:52:33,174
He attacked Officer Rigg first.

525
00:52:33,175 --> 00:52:34,875
That's your court..................????

526
00:52:35,376 --> 00:52:37,849
Me. I saw the whole thing.

527
00:52:39,012 --> 00:52:41,048
You want to testify before Grand Jury?

528
00:52:41,049 --> 00:52:42,659
I've already signed IA's affidavit.

529
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,307
The charges are being dismissed.

530
00:52:44,408 --> 00:52:46,432
You guys are. You're good.

531
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:47,304
You know you're...

532
00:52:47,305 --> 00:52:50,380
You're obviously as thick as thieves....?????

533
00:52:50,381 --> 00:52:51,434
It'll come back to you.

534
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:51,710
You know that right?

535
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:53,903
Maybe, one day. 
Someday, it will.

536
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:54,904
It will come back to you.

537
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:03,941
You understand?

538
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:06,575
Who the fuck are you?

539
00:53:06,576 --> 00:53:08,965
Hey, do you understand?

540
00:53:19,433 --> 00:53:20,503
Who the fuck are you?

541
00:54:57,625 --> 00:54:59,813
????????

542
00:55:00,114 --> 00:55:01,319
What the hell did you do?

543
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:02,948
I...

544
00:55:12,581 --> 00:55:14,744
What's happening?!

545
00:55:18,063 --> 00:55:20,947
The human body is fascinating organism.

546
00:55:20,948 --> 00:55:26,425
It can withstand the most brutal injury and 
yet repair itself miraculously.

547
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:28,851
But you know this all too well.

548
00:55:29,052 --> 00:55:34,251
How many broken bones have you 
suffered at the hands of your husband?

549
00:55:34,552 --> 00:55:36,679
How many flesh wounds have you endured?

550
00:55:37,408 --> 00:55:38,478
Help!!!

551
00:55:38,479 --> 00:55:42,415
With time, the bruises have healed 
but your pain has not.

552
00:55:44,765 --> 00:55:48,864
Today, I empower you to take control of your life.

553
00:55:49,173 --> 00:55:54,313
Can you disconnect from the one thing that has 
brought you and others so much pain?

554
00:55:54,878 --> 00:55:56,713
With time, your wounds will heal.

555
00:55:58,384 --> 00:56:00,235
His, however, will not.

556
00:56:05,387 --> 00:56:07,262
Remove the ties that bind.

557
00:56:07,463 --> 00:56:08,623
Get me out of here!!!

558
00:56:08,858 --> 00:56:11,760
Or bleed to death from your inactivity.

559
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:13,305
The choice is yours.

560
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:14,306
??????????

561
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:23,419
Sorry.

562
00:56:27,268 --> 00:56:27,895
Morgan...

563
00:56:27,896 --> 00:56:30,169
Morgan, what the fuck are you doing?!

564
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:03,494
Help me.

565
00:57:03,495 --> 00:57:05,701
Please don't ???????????

566
00:57:06,941 --> 00:57:07,830
- Please calm down.
- Don't leave me.

567
00:57:07,831 --> 00:57:09,180
No, don't go. Don't go!

568
00:57:09,215 --> 00:57:10,973
Don't go away from me. 
Please get me out.

569
00:57:10,974 --> 00:57:12,198
Please get me out...

570
00:57:13,425 --> 00:57:14,718
Don't go! Don't leave me here!

571
00:57:17,803 --> 00:57:18,992
Hello, Officer Rigg.

572
00:57:18,993 --> 00:57:20,878
What have you learnt thus far?

573
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,520
Experience is a harsh teacher.

574
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:24,956
First comes the test.

575
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:27,296
Second comes the lesson.

576
00:57:28,248 --> 00:57:35,039
If you are to save as I save, then you will see that 
the person before you is but a student.

577
00:57:35,657 --> 00:57:37,299
So I ask you Officer Rigg.

578
00:57:37,876 --> 00:57:39,672
Has the pupil learnt her lesson?

579
00:57:40,229 --> 00:57:42,554
Has she been told the error of her ways?

580
00:57:44,008 --> 00:57:46,467
Does she now view the world differently?

581
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:53,924
Officer Rigg, the key to this person's 
freedom lies in the palm of your hand.

582
00:57:54,325 --> 00:58:00,355
But only after she has done her own part, 
can you play your role in her salvation?

583
00:58:00,356 --> 00:58:08,064
Once judgment has been made though, the key to 
finding your next destination is just off the map.

584
00:58:08,165 --> 00:58:09,285
Who did this to you?

585
00:58:09,901 --> 00:58:11,530
I don't know.

586
00:58:13,762 --> 00:58:14,726
Oh fuck.

587
00:58:17,217 --> 00:58:18,648
Its just off the map.

588
00:58:19,777 --> 00:58:20,808
Just off the map.

589
00:58:22,484 --> 00:58:23,246
????

590
00:58:27,813 --> 00:58:28,822
Go home.

591
00:58:32,127 --> 00:58:32,937
Where is she?

592
00:58:33,178 --> 00:58:34,293
???????

593
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:35,536
Please...

594
00:58:42,803 --> 00:58:44,742
???????

595
00:58:49,736 --> 00:58:51,212
You gotta save yourself.

596
00:58:56,154 --> 00:58:56,993
?????

597
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:06,450
???????

598
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:12,286
??????

599
00:59:12,287 --> 00:59:13,053
No.

600
00:59:16,383 --> 00:59:17,473
Shut up!

601
00:59:17,474 --> 00:59:19,408
???????????

602
00:59:22,576 --> 00:59:24,096
Save as I save.

603
00:59:24,697 --> 00:59:26,813
So what did he do? 
Free her and let him die?

604
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:27,745
This guy didn't have a chance.

605
00:59:27,746 --> 00:59:30,250
He's got rods going through every 
major arteries in his body.

606
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:31,673
You life is in her hands.

607
00:59:31,674 --> 00:59:33,639
Rigg didn't kill this guy.
His wife did.

608
00:59:34,034 --> 00:59:36,556
She identified Officer Rigg. 
Said he saved her.

609
00:59:36,557 --> 00:59:37,894
Saved her?

610
00:59:38,395 --> 00:59:39,639
Passed Rigg's judgments.

611
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,159
He got her fixed and 
got her freedom back.

612
00:59:45,467 --> 00:59:45,726
Yeah?

613
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:46,675
Second address?

614
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:52,868
Ok yeah. That's good.
Good.

615
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:54,711
But I still need that address.
Text me.

616
00:59:55,315 --> 00:59:58,322
I just found out something very interesting 
about the three people in the traps.

617
00:59:58,812 --> 01:00:01,923
They were all represented by a 
lawyer named Art Blanc.

618
01:00:02,024 --> 01:00:03,121
He got them all off?

619
01:00:03,122 --> 01:00:04,402
Yeah, but wait it gets better.

620
01:00:04,403 --> 01:00:05,906
He's also Jill Tuck's lawyer.

621
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:08,047
Look out!

622
01:00:13,337 --> 01:00:14,847
There's a lair. 
Where's the lair?

623
01:00:14,848 --> 01:00:15,948
?????. 
It doesn't exist.

624
01:00:16,149 --> 01:00:17,707
Jigsaw wanted us to find that place.

625
01:00:17,908 --> 01:00:18,932
Where's the new game being played?

626
01:00:19,133 --> 01:00:20,620
Find that place, we find Rigg.

627
01:00:20,621 --> 01:00:22,739
We got a second address. 
There's a co-owner.

628
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:23,283
Who?

629
01:00:23,284 --> 01:00:23,941
Jill Tuck.

630
01:00:23,942 --> 01:00:25,632
Jill Tuck? Which building?

631
01:00:25,633 --> 01:00:26,800
Here. This building.

632
01:01:36,428 --> 01:01:37,790
Hello, Agent Perez.

633
01:01:38,499 --> 01:01:41,874
And welcome to the world that 
you have long studied.

634
01:01:42,253 --> 01:01:47,468
Your partner, Agent Strahm, will soon 
take the life of an innocent man.

635
01:01:47,714 --> 01:01:49,541
Heed my warning, Agent Perez.

636
01:01:49,742 --> 01:01:52,867
Your next move is critical.

637
01:01:58,348 --> 01:01:59,287
What is that?

638
01:02:17,822 --> 01:02:18,789
Paramedics!

639
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:20,585
Help!

640
01:02:21,775 --> 01:02:22,866
Lindsey, stay with us.

641
01:02:23,803 --> 01:02:24,702
Okay. Come on.

642
01:02:24,903 --> 01:02:25,929
????? Come on.

643
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,299
Stay with me, alright.

644
01:02:54,466 --> 01:02:55,283
Hey.

645
01:02:57,568 --> 01:02:59,069
Hey you. Come here.

646
01:03:02,046 --> 01:03:03,849
Hey.

647
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:05,026
Come on!

648
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:08,705
Hey.

649
01:03:24,455 --> 01:03:25,459
Fuck!

650
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,369
Hey!

651
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:30,783
Listen to me. I'm not the one you 
gotta worry about, you understand me.

652
01:03:31,018 --> 01:03:32,727
I'm not the one you gotta worry about.

653
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:39,267
As a matter of fact, I'd recommend you 
stay alive until the fucking...

654
01:03:39,901 --> 01:03:41,661
...clock counts down.

655
01:03:43,707 --> 01:03:44,633
Here's the good news.

656
01:03:44,634 --> 01:03:49,118
If this other guy passes his tests, 
the three of us can go free.

657
01:03:50,734 --> 01:03:52,536
Hey, look at me.

658
01:03:52,737 --> 01:03:53,732
Look at me.

659
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:57,376
If you don't stay on the block, 
your partner gets electrocuted.

660
01:03:57,777 --> 01:03:59,508
Now for my final task.

661
01:04:02,435 --> 01:04:03,358
Here you go.

662
01:04:05,034 --> 01:04:05,911
Live or die.

663
01:04:07,174 --> 01:04:08,386
You make the choice.

664
01:04:16,377 --> 01:04:17,475
You see that, Jill.

665
01:04:17,476 --> 01:04:19,181
That's a federal fucking indictment.

666
01:04:19,182 --> 01:04:21,211
It's got your name on it. You wanna 
put somebody else's name on it?

667
01:04:21,212 --> 01:04:22,549
You start talking to me, okay?

668
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:25,151
What's with the doll?
What's with the tricycle?

669
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:27,070
Who were John's business associates 
before he ??????

670
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,271
He wasn't the associate type.

671
01:04:30,527 --> 01:04:31,754
Where the hell is our (plan???)?

672
01:04:32,471 --> 01:04:36,128
Obstruction of justice. Aiding ???? 
conspirator to murder.

673
01:04:36,967 --> 01:04:37,676
Talk to me!

674
01:04:37,677 --> 01:04:40,631
In 15 minutes, more people are gonna die, Jill.

675
01:04:40,632 --> 01:04:41,719
Police officers.

676
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:43,194
He's your business partner. He's your friend.

677
01:04:43,195 --> 01:04:47,373
He's the accomplice we have been looking 
for and he is your fucking lawyer.

678
01:04:49,793 --> 01:04:50,372
You see this?

679
01:04:50,373 --> 01:04:52,250
This is my partner's blood.

680
01:04:52,251 --> 01:04:56,912
She's fighting for her life right now 
because of your lunatic husband.

681
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,620
What happened between Jigsaw and Art Blanc?

682
01:05:00,621 --> 01:05:01,621
John?

683
01:05:08,568 --> 01:05:10,061
I guess he's not here either.

684
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,832
What the fuck is this place, Jill?

685
01:05:19,587 --> 01:05:20,846
John gave me that.

686
01:05:20,847 --> 01:05:21,847
What?

687
01:05:25,483 --> 01:05:28,046
Hey, you alright?

688
01:05:28,546 --> 01:05:31,744
You're not returning my calls, buddy.

689
01:05:32,765 --> 01:05:33,658
Listen, John.

690
01:05:35,721 --> 01:05:36,506
I'm sorry.

691
01:05:36,507 --> 01:05:39,976
I understand that what happen was a tragedy?

692
01:05:40,677 --> 01:05:42,020
But I gotta tell you.

693
01:05:43,286 --> 01:05:44,800
Listen, John. I gotta tell you.

694
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:46,400
You know those buildings we're working on.

695
01:05:46,435 --> 01:05:48,117
You take and give my share to Jill.

696
01:05:48,118 --> 01:05:49,584
That's not the way it works, John.

697
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:50,533
See we're partners.

698
01:05:50,534 --> 01:05:53,830
Your designs will make those buildings special.

699
01:05:53,831 --> 01:05:55,565
We got 40 families ready to move in.

700
01:05:55,566 --> 01:05:56,857
40 families, John.

701
01:05:56,858 --> 01:05:58,112
From low-income families.

702
01:05:58,113 --> 01:05:59,782
You can't just walk away.

703
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:02,055
You're their saviour, John.

704
01:06:02,256 --> 01:06:03,528
Get the fuck out of here.

705
01:06:03,529 --> 01:06:05,742
Who are you talking to like that? That's me.

706
01:06:05,743 --> 01:06:06,392
John.

707
01:06:06,393 --> 01:06:07,929
Do you even listen?

708
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,295
Oh, I heard you John.

709
01:06:13,038 --> 01:06:14,287
Get the fuck...

710
01:06:17,465 --> 01:06:18,422
You heard me.

711
01:06:21,271 --> 01:06:22,221
Ok, John.

712
01:06:22,522 --> 01:06:24,996
You take good care of yourself.

713
01:06:26,897 --> 01:06:27,973
You call me when your feeling well.

714
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:49,288
He blamed me.

715
01:06:50,426 --> 01:06:52,082
I don't think he could ever forgive me.

716
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:54,620
His minor time was over.

717
01:06:56,266 --> 01:06:58,570
He was diagnosed with cancer soon after that.

718
01:07:09,264 --> 01:07:10,919
Did you try to contact him again?

719
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:12,510
I tried.

720
01:07:14,366 --> 01:07:16,782
But a different person crawled 
out of the wreckage.

721
01:07:17,786 --> 01:07:19,079
Someone else survived.

722
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:52,240
I asked you not to come here.

723
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:52,869
I just wanna talk to you.

724
01:07:52,881 --> 01:07:53,584
John. John.

725
01:07:54,957 --> 01:07:55,599
Look at this.

726
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,575
What is this?

727
01:07:57,975 --> 01:07:59,231
Why do you have this old picture?

728
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,165
What have you done to him?

729
01:08:02,126 --> 01:08:05,359
I told him not to take life for granted.

730
01:08:06,343 --> 01:08:07,661
I want to play a game.

731
01:08:08,469 --> 01:08:09,653
Your life is a lie.

732
01:08:11,396 --> 01:08:13,277
Now, comes your moment of truth.

733
01:08:13,378 --> 01:08:17,751
As a drug user and a hustler, you've played 
???? with other people's life.

734
01:08:19,289 --> 01:08:21,684
Today, you play with your own.

735
01:09:25,179 --> 01:09:25,655
Fuck.

736
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:33,102
Fuck!

737
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:39,055
Fuck.

738
01:09:40,179 --> 01:09:40,877
It's you.

739
01:09:41,078 --> 01:09:42,525
You did this me.

740
01:09:42,549 --> 01:09:43,114
No.

741
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:45,548
You did this to yourself.

742
01:09:47,111 --> 01:09:49,586
Your greed took the life of 
an innocent child.

743
01:09:49,587 --> 01:09:52,337
Would you give me time to explain, please?

744
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:55,291
I can't give you time. 
No one can.

745
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:56,347
Time is an illusion.

746
01:09:56,348 --> 01:10:00,181
Look. Look. 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

747
01:10:00,182 --> 01:10:02,121
I forgive you, Cecil. 
I do.

748
01:10:02,122 --> 01:10:04,180
Addiction has ruined your life.

749
01:10:04,181 --> 01:10:05,363
I'm bleeding man.

750
01:10:05,364 --> 01:10:07,636
Please, just let me go.

751
01:10:08,056 --> 01:10:09,543
I could let you go.

752
01:10:10,602 --> 01:10:12,254
But that wouldn't serve you.

753
01:10:13,572 --> 01:10:14,994
I'll tell you what I will do, though.

754
01:10:14,995 --> 01:10:19,736
I'll give you a tool to reclaim your life.

755
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:23,670
And to discard the vices that 
have so corrupted your soul.

756
01:10:23,671 --> 01:10:25,948
I don't have a fucking soul.

757
01:10:26,149 --> 01:10:27,940
Maybe, you will in the next life, Cecil.

758
01:10:27,941 --> 01:10:29,768
You see things aren't sequential.

759
01:10:30,592 --> 01:10:32,833
Good doesn't lead to good nor bad to bad.

760
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:36,813
People steal, don't get caught.
Live the good life.

761
01:10:37,414 --> 01:10:40,269
Others lie and cheat. And get elected.

762
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,563
Some people stop to help ?????.

763
01:10:43,564 --> 01:10:47,130
??????

764
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:48,937
There's no accounting for it.

765
01:10:49,955 --> 01:10:51,503
How you play the cards you're dealt.

766
01:10:51,504 --> 01:10:52,676
That's all that matters.

767
01:10:52,677 --> 01:10:53,969
Look at me.

768
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,567
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

769
01:10:57,568 --> 01:10:58,812
No.

770
01:10:59,313 --> 01:11:02,520
Yeah, I understand.

771
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:05,360
You're fucking nuts.

772
01:11:19,595 --> 01:11:22,224
Woah! What the fuck is that?

773
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:27,197
It's the tool that's gonna save your life.

774
01:11:28,698 --> 01:11:29,967
I wanna play a game.

775
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,568
Your life is a lie, Cecil.

776
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,629
Now comes your moment of truth.

777
01:11:37,735 --> 01:11:44,524
As a drug addict and a thief, you prey on the 
kindness of others to fuel your addiction.

778
01:11:44,962 --> 01:11:49,662
Today, we're bringing the uglyness inside 
you out into the open.

779
01:11:49,663 --> 01:11:56,588
Now, in order for you to stay alive, you've to match 
your face with the uglyness of your soul.

780
01:11:58,944 --> 01:12:02,664
You just lean forward into the 
knives with your face.

781
01:12:03,251 --> 01:12:09,489
Press hard enough and you'll release the arm 
and the leg restraints that bind you.

782
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:11,951
Press hard though.

783
01:12:14,365 --> 01:12:15,644
And you'll be free.

784
01:12:15,645 --> 01:12:17,851
You... you sick fuck!

785
01:12:18,204 --> 01:12:18,943
Fuck you!

786
01:12:19,144 --> 01:12:23,703
Or you can sit idly and 
bleed out on the floor.

787
01:12:25,181 --> 01:12:26,494
Live or die, Cecil.

788
01:12:27,711 --> 01:12:29,027
Make your choice.

789
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,039
Fuck you!

790
01:12:42,143 --> 01:12:42,998
Help!

791
01:13:30,493 --> 01:13:34,766
You're dead. You're fucking dead.

792
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:38,381
Fucking dead!

793
01:13:52,811 --> 01:13:53,806
What's happened to you?

794
01:13:57,178 --> 01:13:58,538
What's happened to me?

795
01:14:10,149 --> 01:14:11,384
Now, you don't come back.

796
01:14:13,008 --> 01:14:15,573
You do it for yourself if you can't do it for me.

797
01:14:16,841 --> 01:14:18,130
I lost him too.

798
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:56,437
Four walls build a home.

799
01:15:05,546 --> 01:15:08,011
Something was named after 
John's first building, right?

800
01:15:08,767 --> 01:15:09,362
Yes.

801
01:15:09,363 --> 01:15:09,991
Where is it?

802
01:15:12,644 --> 01:15:14,013
Where is it?

803
01:15:35,337 --> 01:15:36,624
What the fuck does that mean?

804
01:16:38,483 --> 01:16:40,258
Better hope he doesn't come 
through that door.

805
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:43,554
Who?! Who's coming through the door?!

806
01:16:47,977 --> 01:16:48,522
Who is it?!

807
01:18:23,038 --> 01:18:24,542
Who's coming through the door?!

808
01:18:36,936 --> 01:18:37,290
Fuck.

809
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:00,083
Congratulations, Art.

810
01:19:34,485 --> 01:19:34,921
Who is it?!

811
01:19:39,183 --> 01:19:40,741
Who's coming through the door?!

812
01:19:42,545 --> 01:19:43,338
You're on television.

813
01:19:44,684 --> 01:19:45,977
Who the fuck is it?!

814
01:19:45,978 --> 01:19:46,978
????

815
01:19:53,102 --> 01:19:53,717
Oh shit.

816
01:19:56,945 --> 01:19:58,133
Teach me, motherfucker.

817
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:02,906
I'm standing right here.

818
01:20:19,644 --> 01:20:20,395
Lynn...

819
01:20:46,349 --> 01:20:47,216
What is that?!

820
01:20:48,566 --> 01:20:50,969
That's to release us when the timer's up.

821
01:20:55,690 --> 01:20:56,979
????

822
01:20:59,516 --> 01:20:59,942
Fuck.

823
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:22,266
Don't open it!

824
01:22:08,028 --> 01:22:09,748
Let me see your fucking hands!

825
01:22:09,783 --> 01:22:11,771
Release my daughter! 
You mother...

826
01:22:14,047 --> 01:22:14,847
Fuck.

827
01:22:23,045 --> 01:22:23,815
Jesus...

828
01:22:37,539 --> 01:22:40,086
Aw, you stupid motherfucker.
What did you do?

829
01:22:40,387 --> 01:22:41,732
I had more time.

830
01:22:41,733 --> 01:22:43,752
I said I ??????

831
01:22:43,753 --> 01:22:44,866
What is wrong with that ???????

832
01:22:44,867 --> 01:22:46,785
- You fucking did this!
- No, you idiot.

833
01:22:46,786 --> 01:22:49,033
- You fucking did this!
- No, Jigsaw's testing you.

834
01:22:49,034 --> 01:22:50,287
You fucking piece of shit!

835
01:22:50,869 --> 01:22:52,558
Put your fucking hands where I can see it.

836
01:22:52,559 --> 01:22:53,944
Put your fucking hands where I can see it.

837
01:22:53,945 --> 01:22:55,971
- Jigsaw's fucking testing you!
- Don't fucking move!

838
01:23:00,015 --> 01:23:01,099
Hello, Officer Rigg.

839
01:23:01,917 --> 01:23:09,277
If you hearing this, then you have reached 
Detective Matthews and Detective Hoffman in under 90 minutes.

840
01:23:10,366 --> 01:23:11,598
Resulting in their deaths.

841
01:23:12,383 --> 01:23:13,814
The rules were clear.

842
01:23:14,215 --> 01:23:16,075
You were warned.

843
01:23:16,076 --> 01:23:16,844
<i>It's Kerry.</i>

844
01:23:16,877 --> 01:23:18,295
<i>Do not go throught that door.</i>

845
01:23:18,596 --> 01:23:20,943
<i>You know never to go through an unsecured door, ever.</i>

846
01:23:21,952 --> 01:23:24,166
<i>Tonight, you face your obsession.</i>

847
01:23:24,267 --> 01:23:27,586
<i>What you can't do is save everyone.</i>

848
01:23:27,587 --> 01:23:29,262
<i>Will you learn how to let go?</i>

849
01:23:30,186 --> 01:23:31,895
<i>Eric is still out there man.</i>

850
01:23:31,896 --> 01:23:32,885
<i>It's time to let go.</i>

851
01:23:32,886 --> 01:23:35,584
<i>Detective Matthews has but ninety minutes.</i>

852
01:23:35,585 --> 01:23:40,132
<i>I'd recommend you stay alive until the 
fucking clock counts down.</i>

853
01:23:40,133 --> 01:23:42,086
<i>They have to save themselves.</i>

854
01:23:42,949 --> 01:23:43,501
<i>Take em.</i>

855
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:50,098
<i>Their salvation was out of your hand</i>

856
01:23:51,082 --> 01:23:55,531
<i>Time was on your side but your obsession 
wouldn't let you wait.</i>

857
01:23:55,904 --> 01:24:00,071
<i>Instead of saving Detective Matthews, 
you cost him his life.</i>

858
01:24:00,372 --> 01:24:02,362
<i>You failed your final test.</i>

859
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,106
<i>What I don't understand is how the hell could 
Jigsaw do all of these.</i>

860
01:24:30,107 --> 01:24:32,325
<i>He was damn near on his death bed 
the last time we saw him.</i>

861
01:24:32,326 --> 01:24:33,623
<i>I'm not so sure he did it.</i>

862
01:24:40,468 --> 01:24:42,182
<i>This wasn't done by Amanda Young.</i>

863
01:24:42,183 --> 01:24:42,775
<i>Excuse me?</i>

864
01:24:42,776 --> 01:24:44,098
<i>She couldn't get her up there alone.</i>

865
01:24:44,155 --> 01:24:44,963
<i>John Kramer was.</i>

866
01:24:44,998 --> 01:24:46,057
<i>He's brains. Not brawn.</i>

867
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:49,236
<i>We're here to find the person helping 
Jigsaw and Amanda Young.</i>

868
01:25:00,189 --> 01:25:02,270
<i>Looks like another doctor went missing from the hospital.</i>

869
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:06,935
<i>Go home.</i>

870
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:12,057
<i>We chose this.</i>

871
01:25:29,173 --> 01:25:30,025
Game over.

872
01:25:59,557 --> 01:26:01,839
You feel you're not ???? control, don't you?

873
01:26:04,171 --> 01:26:06,348
You think you will walk away untested?

874
01:26:13,863 --> 01:26:16,674
I promise that my work will continue.

875
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:19,258
That I have insured.

876
01:26:20,151 --> 01:26:24,709
By hearing this tape, some will assume 
that this is over.

877
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:26,504
But I am still among you.

878
01:26:28,068 --> 01:26:31,227
You think it's over just because I'm dead?

879
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:35,118
It's not over. The games have just begun.
