there were five bodies

- To Notary Hardenbrook's.

- Yes.

I have.

576
01:05:31,038 --> 01:05:33,404
Hopeless.

01:05:52,493 --> 01:05:54,859
Leave me alone !

581
01:05:54,929 --> 01:05:57,864
As soon as you show me the last will
and testament of old man Van Garrett.

582
01:05:57,932 --> 01:06:00,924
The will leaves everything
to his son.

583
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:05,267
Who died with him !
So the estate passes to the next of kin.

584
01:06:05,339 --> 01:06:08,240
Naturally.
All legal and above board.

585
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:10,800
Sir ?

586
01:06:11,879 --> 01:06:14,712
I'm a dead man.
No, no.

587
01:06:16,317 --> 01:06:19,081
Van Garrett's seal...
broken !

588
01:06:21,722 --> 01:06:24,657
Seems Van Garrett made a new will
just before he died.

589
01:06:24,725 --> 01:06:27,091
Naming...

590
01:06:27,161 --> 01:06:29,254
Widow Winship ?

591
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:31,230
And here, look.

592
01:06:31,298 --> 01:06:34,961
- A marriage certificate.
- Aha !

593
01:06:35,035 --> 01:06:37,629
Old Van Garrett
secretly married the widow.

594
01:06:37,705 --> 01:06:41,232
Left everything to her
and her unborn child.

595
01:06:41,308 --> 01:06:45,176
So the new will stood between
the Van Garrett fortune...

596
01:06:45,246 --> 01:06:47,441
and the person who would have
otherwise inherited everything.

597
01:06:47,514 --> 01:06:52,781
It's true. But we four were
drawn in against our will !

598
01:06:52,853 --> 01:06:55,413
- Your will ?
- He means--

599
01:06:55,489 --> 01:06:59,949
Of course.
The four town elders.

600
01:07:00,027 --> 01:07:02,689
Now I see what parts
you had to play.

601
01:07:04,365 --> 01:07:07,823
Reverend Steenwyck knew the secret
because he performed the marriage.

602
01:07:07,901 --> 01:07:10,802
Dr. Lancaster attended
the pregnant woman.

603
01:07:10,871 --> 01:07:14,034
Magistrate Philipse
gave protection of the law.

604
01:07:14,108 --> 01:07:17,271
And Notary Hardenbrook concealed
the documents,

605
01:07:17,344 --> 01:07:20,507
which had been entrusted by Van Garrett
to his faithful servant.

606
01:07:20,581 --> 01:07:22,981
The four conspirators
drawn into the plot.

607
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:26,952
We did not know
it was a murdering plot.

608
01:07:27,021 --> 01:07:29,182
But I have not finished,
sir.

609
01:07:29,256 --> 01:07:32,419
First, the Van Garretts,
father and son, slain by a horseman...

610
01:07:32,493 --> 01:07:34,688
raised from the grave
to chop heads !

611
01:07:34,762 --> 01:07:38,789
Now, up pops a widow with a claim
on the fortune. Off with her head !

612
01:07:38,866 --> 01:07:42,029
But murder begets murder.

613
01:07:42,102 --> 01:07:45,936
It was the servant,
Jonathan Masbath.

614
01:07:46,006 --> 01:07:48,338
The night father and son
quarrelled over the new will,

615
01:07:48,409 --> 01:07:53,005
Jonathan Masbath was summoned
upstairs to bear witness.

616
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:57,676
Here is his signature. I'm afraid it
was his death warrant, young Masbath.

617
01:07:57,751 --> 01:08:00,743
The Horseman
came for him.

618
01:08:00,821 --> 01:08:05,451
Came for him at the bidding
ofsomeone who had power over him.

619
01:08:05,526 --> 01:08:08,927
Someone who dug in the earth in
the Western Woods and stole the skull !

620
01:08:08,996 --> 01:08:11,464
The missing head which must
be restored to the Horseman...

621
01:08:11,532 --> 01:08:13,466
before he will return to hell !

622
01:08:13,534 --> 01:08:15,729
Someone who stood to gain
or lose a fortune.

623
01:08:15,803 --> 01:08:19,899
None otherthan Van Garrett's
next of kin.

624
01:08:19,973 --> 01:08:22,271
Baltus Van Tassel !

625
01:08:27,581 --> 01:08:30,778
Katrina ?
Why are you in my room ?

626
01:08:30,851 --> 01:08:34,218
Because it is yours.

627
01:08:35,356 --> 01:08:37,790
Was it wicked of me ?

628
01:08:37,858 --> 01:08:40,884
No, no, not at all.

629
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:44,891
I missed you.
Where did you go ?

630
01:08:44,965 --> 01:08:47,866
To the Notary.
I had questions to ask Hardenbrook.

631
01:08:47,935 --> 01:08:49,903
Did you learn anything
of interest ?

632
01:08:52,272 --> 01:08:53,933
Perhaps.

633
01:08:54,007 --> 01:08:56,976
- My father--
- Your father ?

634
01:08:57,044 --> 01:09:00,912
Yes. My father thinks
you should return to New York.

635
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:04,314
Really ?
Why is that ?

01:26:45,282 --> 01:26:47,773
To enter your house
as your mother's sicknurse.

792
01:26:47,851 --> 01:26:51,446
and put her body into the grave
and my own into the marriage bed.

793
01:26:51,521 --> 01:26:56,083
Not quite so easy
was to secure my legacy.

794
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:58,821
The widow had to go,
of course,

795
01:26:58,895 --> 01:27:01,125
and the servant Masbath.

796
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:04,964
And just the other day,
that silly midwife, Killian,

797
01:27:05,035 --> 01:27:09,233
toldme the widow had told her
a big secret.

798
01:27:09,306 --> 01:27:11,706
And she told me this
right in front of her husband.

799
01:27:11,775 --> 01:27:13,675
What a goose !

800
01:27:13,744 --> 01:27:16,542
So. another little job
for the Horseman.

801
01:27:19,116 --> 01:27:24,520
But lust delivered
the Reverend Steenwyck into my power.

802
01:27:26,256 --> 01:27:29,191
Fear did the same
for the Notary Hardenbrook...

803
01:27:29,259 --> 01:27:31,523
and the drunkard Philipse.

804
01:27:31,595 --> 01:27:34,120
And the doctor's silence
I exchanged...

805
01:27:34,197 --> 01:27:39,692
for my complicity in his fornications
with the servant girl. Sarah.

806
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:42,068
Yes, you have
everything now.

807
01:27:42,139 --> 01:27:46,838
No ! You have, my dear,
by your father's will.

808
01:27:48,145 --> 01:27:51,114
I get everything
in the event of your death !

809
01:27:52,516 --> 01:27:54,541
Oh. my sister. by the way.

810
01:27:54,618 --> 01:27:58,019
sadly passed away...

811
01:27:59,823 --> 01:28:03,725
quite recently.

812

[Katrina]
You killed your own sister?

813
01:28:05,996 --> 01:28:10,023
She brought it on herself
by helping you and your master !

- Is he dead ?
- That's the problem.

824
01:30:52,095 --> 01:30:54,256
He was dead to begin with.

You'll soon get your bearings,
