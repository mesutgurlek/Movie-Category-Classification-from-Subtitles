save my family.

330
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,764

332
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,194
You're mistaken.

00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,690

"son of the dragon."

how many innocents
you have killed?

337
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,367
Was it hundreds?

338
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,411

341
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,844
and I'll open you from
your belly to your brain

342
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,138
and feed you
your intestines.

343
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,465
Thousands.

344
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,555
And when you put
them to the stake,
what did you feel?

345
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,641
Shame? Horror?

346
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,472
Power?

347
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,978
Answer me!

348
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,605
Nothing!

349
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,361
I felt nothing.

350
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,438
A greater crime
than the act itself.

351
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,114
Then why spill blood

352
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,067
if not for the pleasure of it?

353
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:11,404
Because men do not
fear swords.

354
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,664
They fear monsters.

355
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,580
They run from them.

356
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,335
By putting one
village to the stake,

357
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,333
I spared 10 more.

358
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,292
Sometimes the world
no longer needs a hero.

359
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,090
Sometimes what it needs

360
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,341
is a monster.

361
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,384
And you believe you know

362
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,092
what it is to be
a monster? Hmm?

But I'm going
to show you.

367
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:14,384
For centuries,
these moldering walls
have been my gallows.

368
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,059
For I'm bound to this cave,

369
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,354
condemned by
one who turned me.

370
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,432
Oh, and I have
waited an eternity

371
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,892
for a man of your strength,

372
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,527
your gifts, your will.

373
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:29,407
A man worthy of the dark
and all its powers.

374
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,903
For if I am your salvation,

375
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,366
you are mine.

376
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,998

You will have
a taste of my power.

378
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,837
The strength of 100 men.

379
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,796
The speed
of a falling star.

380
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,929
Dominion over the night
and all its creatures.

381
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,433
To see and hear
through their senses.

382
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,933
Even heal grievous wounds.

383
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,269
At what price?

384
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,024
Once you drink,

385
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,855
your thirst
for human blood

386
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,690
will be insatiable.

387
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:17,034
But if you can
resist for three days,

388
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,369
you will return to
your mortal state

389
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,121
having sampled my power,

390
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,123
and perhaps,
saved your people.

391
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,962
And if I feed?

392
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,380
The price would
be worse than

393
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,378
if you'd never
stepped in here.

394
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,423
For I will be set free

395
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,637
Having granted the darkness
a worthy offering.

396
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,762
You will become
its vessel as I am.

397
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,677
A scourge on this earth

398
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,889
destined to destroy
everything you hold dear.

399

precious wife and son.

401
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,110
I would die
before I harmed them.

402
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,314
Indeed you will,
I'm afraid.

403
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,657
I, however,
will at last be free

404
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,111
to unleash my wrath against
the one who betrayed me.

405
00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:01,165
And one day,
I will call on you
to serve me, my pawn,

406
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,376
in an immortal
game of revenge.

hope versus despair.

And all the world's
fate hangs in the balance.
