158
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,411
Yeah.

159
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,331
If you ask me, though,
nature sucks.

160
00:15:56,373 --> 00:16:01,336
Well, the next time she gets dumped,
we'll take her to New York.

161
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,008
Drop your pants.

162
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,511
What?

163
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,638
When do people
always show up, Evan?

164
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,391
What are we doing?

165
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,810
Consider it an experiment
in probability theory.

166
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,812
Really?

167
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,356
(Radio: : Woman Singing)

168
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,359
Mmm. I love you.

169
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,361
I know.

170
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,656
(Southern Accent) Now get them
trousers off, boy. Don't be a sissy.

171
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,575
All right.
(Laughs)

172
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:38,331
(Man) You know, I've been thinking
about this whole wedding thing...

173
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,875
and I think we should
take a trip down to Mexico.

174
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,962
Mm-hmm.
I'm talking about a long weekend...

175
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:48,341
margaritas, the two of us
on a beach alone, sunset.

176
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:52,804
And, you know,
I'm talking about just, just eloping.

177
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,850
You know what I mean?
Uh, wait a second.

178
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,269
You wanna know what I think?

179
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,271
Yes, please.

180
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:05,025
I think if you ever
want to get in my pants again,
Affirmative.

181
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,777
This is the last time
you use the "E" word.

182
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:11,865
Okay? Okay.

183
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,117
Yeah, is a disgusting word.

184
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,286
Hey, guys, hold on.

185
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,417
Hey, is anyone up there?

186
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,129
Hello!

187
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:30,050
There must be people nearby.
Anyone up there?

188
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:34,095
Somebody had to start it.
(Bird Squawking)

189
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,139
Les keep moving.

190
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,560
Hello?

191
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,400
Freaky.

192
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,616
Oh, look at this.
Is fucked!

193
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:58,244
Nothing. Nothing.

194
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,958
Hey, did you find
anything to eat?

195
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,628
They took all my Power Bars.

196
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,464
Um, no.

197
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:13,093
No. Sorry.

198
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:20,642
Damn it. Scott and Carly
took all our friggin' sunscreen.

199
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,271
Does he have any good CD's?

200
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:30,485
Mmm. Definitely not.

201
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,697
(Rustling, Bird Squawking)

202
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:38,326
You know, I think this guy
must be some kind of doctor.

203
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:42,372
Maybe we could get him to write us
some prescriptions when he gets back.

204
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,583
(Sighs) He doesn't have
any smokes either.

205
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,627
Almost out.

206
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,762
Evan?

207
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,943
Evan? Where are you?

208
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,031
Hey, baby,
what are you doing?

209
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:20,869
I'm just... amusing myself.
Whoooo!

210
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,705
You, uh, getting
anything there, chatty?

211
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,124
No, nothing.
I'm gonna miss this thing.

212
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:30,378
Why didn't you just fly?
I put all of my money
into that car back there.

213
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:34,883
Okay, forget eloping, but there is an idea we
should discuss about the band for our wedding.

214
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:39,220
I think we should hire a... you know,
a Frank Sinatra-type, uh, lead singer...

215
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,474
as opposed to
a James Brown-type lead singer...

216
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,477
because, you know, really, les be
honest, there's only oneJames Brown...

217
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,897
and, you know, a faux James Brown
is really quite intolerable.

218
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:56,529
Evan? Where are you?

219
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,741
You pissing or something?

220
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:07,290
Evan?

221
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:41,449
You know, plus he'd be grinding his hips,
and my grandmother would be...

222
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:46,621
yes, revolted
but also strangely fascinated
in a completely disturbing way...

223
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:49,165
and, um...

224
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,294
Baby?

225
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,717
Carly, I wa...
I was kidding.

226
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,428
Carly?

227
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,809
(Bird Squawking)
Evan?

228
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:16,860
(Flies Buzzing)

229
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:22,615
(Gasps, Whimpers)

230
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:32,792
(Screaming, Gasping)

231
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,797
Sweetheart?
Hey, guys, hold up!

232
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,384
Guys, hold up
for a second, all right?

233
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:45,138
Baby, seriously,
this isn't funny.

234
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,392
(Laughs)
Jesus God!

235
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:52,395
Baby!
(Laughing Continues)

236
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:56,149
L...
Oh, I'm so sorry.

237
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:59,069
I coulïve killed you, woman.
I'm-I'm extremely dangerous.

238
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,863
You wanna know
why I love you so much?

239
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,074
Because you're so fun
to play with.

240
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:07,202
Is that why you love me?
That really scared me, baby.

241
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:10,413
I'm sorry.
That really scared me.
Would you not do that?

242
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,916
(Chris, Echoing)
Hello!

243
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:17,879
Hello!

244
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:24,511
There's, uh, nothing
like stating the obvious, huh?

245
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:28,890
(Laughing)
Hey, baby, look at this.

246
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:33,728
Whoo! Hey, Carly, I think
this would be good time for you
to confront your fear of...

247
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,065
Don't!
Okay, that is not funny.

248
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:39,276
Look who's scared now.

249
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:44,906
Sorry.
Whatever.

250
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:47,951
Just get me to a motel room...

251
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,203
run me a very hot bath...

252
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:53,915
and be prepared to provide me
with a lot of orgasms.

253
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,419
Oh!
I think they need to be alone.

254
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,255
What do you expect?
They just got engaged.

255
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,465
They're happy.
Is a hard thing to find.

256
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,467
Yeah.

257
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,594
Got it?
Limber tongue. Got it.

258
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:08,596
(Laughs)
You're stupid.

259
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,943
(Woman) Maybe we shouldn't
have left Francine and Evan.

260
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:24,487
(Chris)
Don't worry. They're fine.

261
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,657
(Chris) You guys okay?
(Scott) Super.

262
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:34,331
(Woman) Well, wait, guys.
This road isn't on here.

263
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:37,292
(Carly) Thas because you don't have
the Redneck World Atlas.

264
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:41,171
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. I think
we've just been saved, kids.

265
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:43,381
Can I get a...
(Whoops)

266
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:45,800
(Laughs)

267
00:23:51,056 --> 00:23:54,726
(Wind Chimes Jingling)
Make this quick.

268
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,437
Actually, maybe we
should keep walking.

269
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,774
What? The next house is gonna have
a white picket fence?

270
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:03,276
Yeah, if there is
a next house.

271
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,156
Hey.
What?

272
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:27,926
(Chris)
Hello?

273
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:30,929
All right, this isn't right.

274
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,931
Hello?

275
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:41,231
Hello? Anybody home?

276
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:46,027
(Triangle Clanging)
Whoa, baby! Could you... Shh!

277
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:48,655
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

278
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:52,534
I was gonna see if they had a phone.
You guys can wait out here if you want.

279
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:55,203
You can't just go barging
into someone's house like that.

280
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:58,039
Yeah, 'cause, you know,
I'm just thinkin'...

281
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:00,750
West Virginia, trespassing...
not a great combination.

282
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,086
Look, I need to pee.

283
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,089
Well, I need to remind you
of a little movie called Deliverance.

284
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:12,887
Guys, we got two wrecked cars.
I mean, we really need a phone.

285
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,773
Hello?

286
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:26,234
Hello?

287
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,278
Carly.

288
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:36,036
Hello?

289
00:25:36,077 --> 00:25:40,290
(Flies Buzzing)

290
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,762
(Scott)
What the fuck?

291
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:56,848
(Jessie) Les just do
what we gotta do and get out ofhere.

292
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:03,104
(Carly)
Hey, I am not sensing a phone here.

293
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:05,398
Hello!

294
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,068
Okay, who lives here?

295
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:11,905
(Carly) I don't know, but can you
help me find a bathroom?

296
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,074
Baby, I think
this is the bathroom.

297
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:18,912
(Scott Groans)
Oh, fuck.

298
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,792
(Chris) Oh, my God.
Look at this place.

299
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:26,628
(Scott) Seriously, guys,
I think we should go.

300
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,963
Help me find the bathroom.
Then we'll go.

301
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:31,591
Baby, what if this place
belongs to some kind of cult?

302
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,302
I read in Newsweek how
economically depressed places...

303
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:37,597
are like breeding grounds for
all kinds of apocalyptic visionaries.

304
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,433
Order of the Solar Temple, Church of
the Lamb of God, the Chijon family.

305
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,936
Remember them?
Hey, brainiac!

306
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:44,938
Shh!

307
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:48,942
All right.
Maybe that door.

308
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:00,328
Christ!
(Carly Screams)

309
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,832
(Chris) You okay?
Is just a paddle. Is all right.

310
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,627
(Jingling)

311
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,213
(Carly)
Whoa.

312
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,302
God, look at this place.

313
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:18,179
Yeah. Is like
the garage sale from hell.

314

How'd they get away with this?
Oh, my God. All these people.

We gotta take it.
How are we supposed to do that?

One of us leads them
in the wrong direction...

411
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:23,506
and the rest commandeer the truck
so they'll run for the runner.

Carly, look at me, okay?
Scott died protecting us.

477
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:39,239
We need to keep ourselves alive,
or it was for nothing. Okay?

478
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:41,574
We're all in this together, Carl.

479
00:45:41,616 --> 00:45:43,576
Come on.

480
00:45:43,618 --> 00:45:45,829
(Crying)
I want him back.

481
00:45:45,912 --> 00:45:48,081
Shh.

482
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,793

(Grunting)

484
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:56,923
(Crying Continues)
Carl, look at me. Okay? Look.

485
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:59,426
We're gonna stay alive.
We're gonna get out of this.

486
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:04,097
We're gonna find the police and
make sure those motherfuckers
are punished for this. Okay?

487
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:09,978
Carly.

488
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,981
Come on, Carly.
You can do it.

489
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:17,193
Is gonna get dark soon.
Come on.

490
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:23,158
We need to find
that road quick.

491

Hey, guys.

00:47:57,961 --> 00:48:00,422
Look.

502

Oh my God.

503

Hello! Is anyone up there?
Shh! Shh!

504
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:18,940
I don't think anyone's up there.
Doesn't matter.

505
00:48:18,982 --> 00:48:21,943
It may have a phone or a radio.
Maybe we can see the road.

506
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:23,612
You okay?

507
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:27,615
(Grunting)

508
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:30,910
Come on.

509
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:30,678
Guys, I don't see
any roads or towns out there.

510
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,264
Les not stand by the window.
They might see us.

511
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:44,025
Hey.
We're all gonna die.

512
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:48,822
Carly, I need you to come help me
look around, please.

513

(Chris)
Thing looks prehistoric.

518
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:18,411
Do you know how to use this?
Uh, let me try.

519
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:22,082
(Carly) It could still work.
(Chris) Don't move anything.

520
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:24,959
Keep it on the frequency they had it on.
(Carly) It works.

521
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:28,129
Can anybody hear me? We have
an emergency. Can anybody hear me?

522
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:30,924
Say "Mayday."

00:51:31,007 --> 00:51:34,010
Look, we have a huge emergency.
Please, does anybody hear me?

524
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:37,430
Someone is injured.
We need help.

Hello. Please, is anybody
out there that can hear me?

Hello.
No.

527
00:51:46,689 --> 00:51:49,859
Get down.
Cover the light.

528
00:51:49,943 --> 00:51:51,945
Shh.

529
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:08,503

538
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,748
We don't know our position.
We're in a watchtower.

539
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:47,333
We must be north
of Bear Mountain Road.

540
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:51,212
Someone is trying to kill us!
They've murdered our friends!
They're after us right now!

541
00:52:51,296 --> 00:52:54,007
I'm having
some trouble hearing you.

542
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,343
If you're in the tower, stay there.
Do you copy?

543
00:52:56,384 --> 00:52:58,720
Yes, we copy! Just hurry, please!
This is an emergency!

544
00:52:58,803 --> 00:53:01,598
Help me move this. Come on! Come on!
(Ranger) We'll come to you.

545
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:04,100
They're after us!
Someone's been shot!

546
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:07,354

and we need help! Please!

I don't know.

553
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:45,475
I think they're going down.

Jesus, what are they doing?
We're on fire.

560
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:43,950
They're trying to burn us out.

561
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:49,039
Oh, my God.

(Chris)
Carly!

563
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:05,138
Come here!
Let go of me! Let go!

564
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,558
I'd rather jump than burn to death!
(Sobbing)

565
00:55:10,268 --> 00:55:12,896
(Jessie) Calm down.
You're right.

566
00:55:12,979 --> 00:55:15,648
What?
She's right.

567
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:19,319
We have to jump. Those branches
are only a few feet down.
Thas more like 20 feet.

568
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:23,031
I don't want to burn, and I don't want to
be chopped into pieces. We can do this.

569
00:55:23,114 --> 00:55:25,241
I'll go first.
