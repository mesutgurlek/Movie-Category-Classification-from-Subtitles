- Now, let's see.

116
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:44,166
A centipede can be considered
a phallic symbol.

Centipedes are
very aggressive creatures.

Their bite can be very painful.

119
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:54,941
Maybe he is connecting the pain
that a centipede inflicts

120
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,674
with the pain inflicted on him

121

And it's your fault
that he's in prison!

- I was really drawn
to the film

00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,910
because of
the medical aspect of it.

If you were a surgeon,

It was so grueling
being on all fours,

387
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,328
so I demanded in my contract
that I had to have

00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:20,097

every night.

demand that in my contract?

shot the centipede stuff,
