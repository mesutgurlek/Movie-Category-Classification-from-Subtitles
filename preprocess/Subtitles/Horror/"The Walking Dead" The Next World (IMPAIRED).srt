No,

it every day for two weeks.

Both:

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,433
- You heard me.
- Yeah.

32
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,301
It's time to change
your bandage.

33
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:45,886
And I need to borrow
some toothpaste.

Okay, but I'm out of toothpaste.

<i>This thing at the bottom

44
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,280
You're talking
about the drink, right?

45
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,181
I am, but...

46
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,902
It's not medical.

47
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:39,690
No, I drew a line between
the important stuff and that.

48
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,526
I just figured, if you saw it.

49
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:43,727
All right.

50
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,863
Anything remotely
medical is a priority.

51
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,781
And food, maybe even
food before medicine,

52
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:51,619
and gas or batteries or books for
the kids or clothes is just...

53
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:55,039
if you see it,
if it just happens to,

54
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,957
you know, be right there.

55
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,959
You like it, right?

56
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:00,511
No, I don't drink pop.

57
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,712
What the hell's pop?

58
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,847
Oh, I'm originally from Ohio.

59
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,952
Why you want it?

60
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,392
Tara was talking about it
in her sleep, I think.

61
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:18,562
Either she likes it
or she doesn't,

62
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:23,534
but if she likes it, it'd
be a really nice surprise.

63
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,786
I'm not good with
that kind of stuff,

64
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,471
and she and Heath are going
on that two-week run.

65
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:30,240
I just thought it'd be
a nice going-away present.

66
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:33,160
Just, uh, don't
go out of your way.

67
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:35,629
And if it gives you
any trouble...

68
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:36,814
I won't.

69
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,349
Okay, good, 'cause
it's not important.

70
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,467
I should've said so instead
of just drawing a line.

71
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,471
Got it.

72
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,941
(growling)

73
00:04:12,284 --> 00:04:15,869
I mapped out some of the agricultural
supply places in the area.

74
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:17,421
Even if they've
been cleaned out,

75
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,707
my bet is that the sorghum
would be untouched.

76
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,542
Now, that there is a
criminally underrated grain

77
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:24,962
that could change the game with our food
situation from scary to hunky-dunky.

78
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,103
I'm talking standability,
drought tolerance,

79
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:36,390
grain-to-stover ratio
that is the envy of all corns.

80
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,778
Think about it.

81
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:44,898
- Thanks.
- All right.

82
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,700
Okay.

83
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:54,024

85
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:18,082
Rick: We're gonna find
food, maybe some people.

86
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,818
The law of averages
has gotta catch up.

87
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,589
Daryl: I don't know. We ain't
seen nobody for weeks.

88
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,025
Maybe we ain't gonna
find nobody.

89
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,693
Maybe that's a good thing.

90
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,870
Don't.

91
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,071
Don't.

He didn't have a gun, either.

Crazy day.

498
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:42,315
You wanna talk about it?

499
00:39:42,317 --> 00:39:44,934
No, not right now.

500
00:39:44,936 --> 00:39:47,520
I just want to turn my
brain off for a minute.

501
00:39:47,522 --> 00:39:49,572
(sighs)

502
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:53,443
You wanna tell me
about your day?

503
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:56,329
No.

504
00:39:56,331 --> 00:39:57,947
Same thing.

505
00:39:57,949 --> 00:39:59,833
What, you found a guy?

506
00:39:59,835 --> 00:40:02,368
Not a guy.

507
00:40:10,879 --> 00:40:12,762
Oh...

508
00:40:18,353 --> 00:40:20,553
got you something.

509
00:40:22,307 --> 00:40:25,525
(both laughing)

510
00:40:27,562 --> 00:40:29,112
Is this instead
of the toothpaste?

511
00:40:29,114 --> 00:40:30,730
Mm-hmm.

512
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:34,067
Well, I do have a crate
of toothpaste for you.

513
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:37,537
It's currently
at the bottom of a lake.

514
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:39,339
Oh, so you had a day.

515
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:42,742
(laughs)
Yeah...

516
00:40:42,744 --> 00:40:45,912
all on account
of your dental hygiene.

517
00:40:45,914 --> 00:40:48,298
Have your mints.

518
00:41:28,423 --> 00:41:29,923
Wait... wait a minute.

519
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:31,925
(whispering indistinctly)

520
00:41:38,633 --> 00:41:41,684
(laughs)

521
00:41:43,522 --> 00:41:45,188
Okay.

522
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:17,301

00:42:21,142 --> 00:42:23,176
Jesus:
<i>Rick.</i>

524
00:42:23,178 --> 00:42:25,311
<i>Rick, wake up.</i>

525
00:42:25,313 --> 00:42:28,147
<i>- (hammer clicks)
- (blade zings)</i>

526
00:42:29,184 --> 00:42:31,184
We should talk.
