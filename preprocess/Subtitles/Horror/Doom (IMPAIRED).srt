00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,635
[rumbling]

160
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,512
Move in.

161
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,672
You hesitate, people die.

162
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,000
[beeping]

163
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,288
(man)
I checked it...

164
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,920
at least three times
before we sent it through.

165
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,628
Sanford Crosby,
UAC Public Relations.

166
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,002
Now follow me, please.
How many people
you got up there?

167
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,507
UAC employs 85 permanent
research staff on Olduvai.

168
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,298
[electronic beeping]

169
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,107
Welcome to the Ark, gentlemen.

170
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,082
(female computer voice #1)
Initiating
molecular mapping drive.

171
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,449
(female computer voice #2)
Initiating
molecular mapping drive.

172
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,314
[electronic beeping continues]

173
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,181
All personnel,
prepare for activation.

174
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,792
Keep your distance
from the core
or you might get sucked in.

175
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,454
You, uh, you done this before?

176
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,626
Once. Training mission.

177
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,799
Hope you had a good dinner,
Kid.

178
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,202
Inter-planet coordinate
lock engaged.

179
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,262
[electronic beeping]

180
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,400
All telemetry verified
and transmissions
are five-by-five.

181
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,241
Soon as we get through,
I need you to shut down
the surface elevator here.

182
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,543
Make sure that we get
the standard quarantine
of six hours.

183
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,345
Target receiver initialized.
Ready to proceed.

184
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,111
Ark travel,
15 seconds and counting.

185
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,254
[alarm sounding]

186
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,193
Five, four...

187
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,867
three, two...

188
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:20,627
one.

189
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,345
Why we gotta come
all this way?

190
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,847
Why can't UAC rent-a-cops
take care of this bullshit?

191
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,686
Is it always that rough?

192
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,159
Believe me,
it used to be a lot rougher.

193
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,258
There was a time when
Ark travel was susceptible
to, let's say...

194
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:49,130
major turbulence.
What's he mean?

195
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:53,194
He means he went
to one galaxy,
his ass went to another.

196
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,735
Call it
a scientific miscalculation.

197
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:02,543
Unbelievable as it may seem,
UAC does make
the odd tiny mistake.

198
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,250
Marcus Pinzerowsky.
You call me Pinky. Follow me.

199
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,144
(Sarge)
Where are the personnel who
aren't locked down in the lab?

200
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,210
In the atrium.

201
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,280
Pinky, put us up.

202
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,659
Activating remote personnel
surveillance.

203
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,494
[beeping]

204
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,292
Circle out men, on my three.

205
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,231
One, two, three.

206
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,467
Killcams up and running.

207
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,673
People, this room
is a code red, which means...

208
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,439
no one gets in
without our permission.

209
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:34,774
It stays ours at all costs.

210
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,213
Mac, stay here with our friend
and secure the door.

211
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,547
Men, on me. Let's move out.

212
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,018
Open the doors.

213
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,080
[hissing]

214
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,734
(man)
Who called in the military?

215
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,513
Where the fuck are we?

216
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,108
Couple million light years
from breakfast.

217
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,415
When can I start
evacuating people out
through the Ark?

218
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,887
We're at a Level 5 quarantine,
nobody goes anywhere.

219
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:22,223
Ladies, we're under
a Level 5 quarantine...

220
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,821
so I'm just gonna have to
strip search you girls.

221
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,890
(woman)
I don't think so.
(Portman)
Hold that thought.

222
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,028
We're under
a Level 5 quarantine,
so I'm just gonna have...

223
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,833
to strip--
(Sarge)
Portman!

224
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,739
Sergeant,
this is Dr. Samantha Grimm,
the UAC science officer...

225
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,902
assigned to retrieve data
from the lab.

226
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:41,037
Sergeant.
(Sarge)
Dr. Grimm.

227
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,547
(Samantha)
Hello, John.
Hello, Samantha.

228
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,049
Hello, Samantha!

229
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,851
(John)
Sarge,
this operation is a code red.

230
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,047
We really don't have room
for passengers.

231
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,580
Excuse me, but I have orders
to retrieve data
from three servers:

232
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,924
Anthropology,
Forensic Archeology,
and Genetics.

233
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,224
This is a military operation,
Doctor.

234
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,358
We're really not here
to retrieve
your science homework.

235
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:06,200
Look, I got an idea.
Why don't you ask your CO
what your orders are?

236
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,672
To contain
and neutralize the threat,
protect the civilians...

237
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,578
and retrieve--
retrieve UAC property.

238
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,015
We finally done here?
Because I've got a job to do.

239
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,946
(Samantha)
If you'll follow me?
You chose this, Reaper.

240
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,955
Is this gonna spoil my day?
No, sir.

241
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,186
Tell me you didn't let
a fine-looking piece of ass...

242
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,455
like that get away from you,
Reaper.
She's my sister.

243
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,520
No shit?
Don't do this again, man.

244
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,587
Do what?

245
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,534
There's three sections
to Carmack's lab complex.

246
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,036
Archeology, Genetics,
and Weapons Research.

247
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,072
You test weapons up here?
Well, it's a dead planet.

248
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,041
You want that stuff
tested here, where it's safe,
or in your own backyard?

249
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,577
We're primarily
an archeological operation.

250
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,113
Weapons Research is in
its own separate facility.

251
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,581
It has nothing to do
with Dr. Carmack's work.

252
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,311
How many inside
when the lab shut down?

253
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,979
Only Dr. Carmack's team.
That's six people.

254
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,956
In one of the carbon dating
labs, there was
an internal phone...

255
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,150
left off the hook.

256
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,489
Did you get any information
from it?

257
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,859
[woman shrieking]

Magnesium, chromium, lead.
It's all normal.

00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,025
All clear.

266
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,694
Pinky, give us a schematic.

267
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,533
Uploading to you now.

268
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,932
(Pinky)
Carmack's lab is isolated
from the rest of the facility.

269
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,177
The airlock is the only way
in or out.

where he sent the mayday from.

272
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,086
Reaper, keep Dr. Grimm here
safe on her salvage op.

273
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:10,151
Duke and I'll take
the weapons lab, make sure
all the hardware's secure.

274
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,890
Be safe, gentlemen.

275
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,457
Portman, Goat, on you.
It's on.

They're on the move.

You don't look like a ''Mac.''

00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,659
Thirty minutes, tops.

You never did time, Portman?

00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,646
What?

313
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,695
This is a holding cell.
Bullshit.

314
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,127

Hey, Sarge, what's the deal
with the sister?

322
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,408
Reaper's parents
led the first team
of archeologists to Olduvai.

323

They died in some accident
when he was a kid.

She followed in their
footsteps, and he didn't.

Oh, yeah, meet Lucy.

Lucy, this is my brother,
John...

341
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,873
another creature
from the long lost past.

You found human remains?
Humanoid.

343
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,270
Lucy and her child
were our first major find.

344

We're bringing out more
every day.

You re-opened the dig?
I know I should have told you.

I didn't figure it was
the sort of thing...

347
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,647
I could jot down on
a yearly birthday card.

It's been stabilized.
Bullshit.

You wanna talk about safe?
Like you took a desk job?

350
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:57,158
I'm a forensic archeologist,
John. I'll go where
the work is.

351
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,328
Is that the only reason
you're up here?

352
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,395
You wanna know
why I'm up here?

353
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:04,137
I'll show you. Come here.

354
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,304
This is Lucy's chromosome
profile. Notice anything?

355
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,981
My molecular genetics
is a little rusty.

356
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,983
What's the first thing
Dad taught us to look for?

357
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,559
She's got 24 pairs
of chromosomes.

358
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,122
Humans only have 23.
But what does
the extra pair do?

359
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,793
Makes her superhuman.

360
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,995
The extra pair makes
her super strong...

361
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:35,505
super fit, super intelligent.

362
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,368
Her cells divide
50 times faster...

363
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,843
meaning she heals
almost instantly.

364
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:44,109
The fossil record
indicates these people
had conquered disease.

365
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,413
We found no genetic disorders,
no viruses, no cancers.

366
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,011
[computer beeping]
So what, they were just
naturally superior?

367
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,147
No. Not naturally.

368
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:55,693
See, the earliest remains
we found only had 23.

369
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:59,226
We suspect this extra
chromosome may be synthetic.

370
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,826
Bioengineered?

371
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,825
That's a long word
for a Marine.

instead of a sniper scope?

375
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:15,244
If they were so smart,
how come they're so dead?

376
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,610
We don't know.

377
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,644
Maybe they just went
with time.

Doctor,
you are going to tell me...

653
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:26,045
just what the fuck
is going on up here.

What?
Come here.

Come here!

This is ''what.''

God.

Have you
found anything like this...

660
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:40,928
on your archeological digs?

661
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:41,987
No.

662
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,862
Is there any way this thing
came from the outside...

663
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:44,923
from the surface?

664
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,833
The planet is completely dead.

665
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,804
It came from somewhere, lady.

666
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,337
Portman, shut up!

667
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:53,137
The atmosphere on the surface
can't support life.

668
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,268
Maybe it doesn't need air.

669
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,039
It could have come from
another planet or something.

670
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,205
What? Like an alien?

671

Look at that thing!

00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,984
You need to shut the fuck up!

(John)
That's not what we saw.

That isn't what Goat and l

of these fucking things?

676

Where are
your surface entry points?

677
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,929
There's a pressure door at
the end of the north corridor.

678

Destroyer, Kid, Portman,

Yes, sir.
Whatever this thing is...

681
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,929
it cannot get back
through the Ark.

with a weapon...

with some ST grenades,
and seal the Ark door.

00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:32,081
The entrance
to the archeological dig.

Don't let anything
through the Ark.

689

Hey, wait. Wait a minute.
You can't leave me here.

690
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,460
I'm not a soldier.

Why don't you go
fuck yourself?

692
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,053
It's bullshit.

693
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,358
You're supposed to protect me.

Don't be a wuss.

Little tension
between you and Reaper?

701
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:35,610
We just went
our separate ways.

702
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,474
Why does a talented student
throw it all away
and join the RRTS?

703
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,678
So, what was
he like before?

704
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:43,480
Who, John?
Yeah.

705
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,077
Empathetic, sensitive.

706
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,385
It's kind of hard for me to
imagine Reaper as sensitive.

707
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:51,617
I knew Reaper before all the
''drop down and give me 50,
woo-ha'' stuff.

708
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:53,890

I have Destroyer.
You know, we grew up together.

You know, Duke, I bet
secretly you have a big heart.

Oh, yeah?

715
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,483
And that's not the only
secret big thing I got.

Oh, lady,
you have no idea.

with me is practically
your civic duty.

on the left,

from getting out.

811
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,521
(John)
Mac, stand by.

812
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:34,752
Destroyer, report.

813
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,355
We've reached
the north airlock.

814
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:37,559
It's secure.

815
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,728
Console indicates nothing's
come in or out for 26 hours.

Mac?

818
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,066
Mac.

819
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,909
Mac, Mac, you copy?

820
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:56,582
Talk to me. Talk to me, Mac.

821
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,044
Shit.

822
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:03,815
Jesus Christ.

825

(Mac)
We're in pursuit.
Moving fast out of the dig.

826
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:14,969
(Sarge)
It's getting away.

827
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,537
Pinky, what do you see?

828
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:18,665
It's big. Very big.

829
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,340
Moving fast,
back towards the lab complex.

830
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:25,503
Clear.

831
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,941
It's back in the lab.

832
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:31,948
[gun clicking]

833
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,312
Clear!

834
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,447
Clear.

835
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:38,692
Damn, it's fast.

836
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:40,960
All around defense, men.

837
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,327
Did you get it?

838
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,058
Pinky.
Yes, Sarge?

839
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,329
Anything gets through
that door...

840
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,370
use an ST grenade.

841
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,268
(Sarge)
It cannot get back to Earth.

842
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,238
He pops an ST in there,
he's gonna blow the Ark.

843
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,504
Reaper, Kid, pairs,
cover formation.

844
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,273
Sweep the corridors. Go.

845
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,878
Destroyer, you and Portman
stay here. Shut the airlock.

846
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:02,110
Maintain a perimeter.

847
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:03,345
He blows the Ark,
how the hell...

848
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,853
are we supposed to
get the fuck home?

849
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,014
Portman,
shut the fucking door.

850
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,655
Where you going?

851
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:10,515
I'm going to the armory.

852
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,785
I think we're gonna
need something...

853
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,420

Dogs got kidneys, right?

00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,368
Pigs got kidneys.

866
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,180
It's had its appendix removed.

This thing
didn't butcher Willits.

875
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:42,910
It is Willits.

876
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,569

00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:53,046

And whose goddamn blood
is on that window?

941
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:54,751
Goat's.

942
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:57,592
He killed himself.

943
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:00,794
What do you mean,
he killed himself?
He was already dead.

944
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,629
It's true.
It's Goat.

945
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:07,531
He was changing into
one of these motherfuckers
and he killed himself.

946
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,976
We found two more scientists
at the dig.

947
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:11,941
Thurman and a balding guy
with glasses.

948
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:13,345
Dr. Clay.

949
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,577
(Samantha)
Did you check their necks?

950
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,382
Were there open wounds
on their necks?

951
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:21,821
We were conducting
a firefight, not an autopsy.

952
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,689
(Sarge)
We came up here to find
six scientists.

953
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,159
Four are known dead...

954
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:29,662
and Dr. Willits is
probably KlA somewhere
down in that sewer.

955
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:31,924
The only one missing
is Dr. Carmack.

956
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:34,094
Has Dr. Carmack showed up yet?

957
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,632
Oh, he's shown up all right.

958
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,130
Look at the left ear.

959
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:43,942
[grunting]

960
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,949
Son of a bitch.

961
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,043
I think this other one
is Steve Willits.

962
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,918
I'm going to run the DNA,
check it against his
med records.

963
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,650
What are you people
working on up here?

964
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:58,318
(Samantha)
We're analyzing bones,
artifacts.

965
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:00,123
We're not doing
anything like this.

966
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,925
Then what the fuck is that?

967
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:06,263
It must be a genetic mutation,
something environmental
or viral.

968
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:07,763
I don't know.

969
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,333
It may even be reversible.

970
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:11,731
It's irreversible.

971
01:10:11,807 --> 01:10:13,172
(Samantha)
Not necessarily.

972
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:14,937
Dr. Carmack's condition...

973
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:17,510
is irreversible...

974
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,408
[grunting]

975
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:21,509
[creature growling]
No!

[gun firing]

977
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:25,115
because Carmack's condition
is that...

978
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:27,380
he's dead.

979
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,458
Kid, you and Duke...

980
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,088
get back to the dig
and you make sure
those other dead scientists...

981
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:35,528
are really dead.

982
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:43,432
I've lost...

983
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,697
four soldiers.

984
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:50,745
What are you people
experimenting with up here?

985
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:55,640
I'm not gonna ask you again.

986
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,950
I told you,
it's an archeological
research center.

987
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,983
Do you think I'm lying to you?
Is that what you're saying?

988
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:09,658
You think
I'm hiding something?

989
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:13,893
I'm telling the truth.

990
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,002
What were you downloading?

991
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:23,010
What were you sent to protect?

992
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,537
The research data.

993
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,378
Research into what?

994
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,720
(Dr. Carmack)
Subject was injected
with study agent at 00.:03.

995
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:41,661
[Curtis groaning]

996
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:46,699
Vitals normal, elevated
heart rate attributable
to subject anxiety.

997
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:47,793
[Curtis screaming]

998
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:52,637
C-24 successfully grafted to
subject's marker cells
at 00.:09.

999
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:55,905
He reconstructed chromosome
mutation on a human subject.

1000
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,274
We were never gonna do
human studies.

1001
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,709
What the hell
are we looking at?

1002
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:04,347
[sighing]

1003
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,980
Genesis, Chapter 1 .

1004
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:12,083
(Dr. Carmack)
Subject moved to protected
observation area at 00.:17.

1005
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,028
Subject.: Curtis Stahl.

1006
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:24,600
Crime.: Multiple murder.

1007
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,875
Status.:
Condemned to execution.

1008
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,342
[grunting]

1009
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:40,813
Chromosome 24.

1010
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:43,847
Oh, my God.

1011
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:47,825
49 minutes after injection,
genetic mutations...

1012
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:51,627
began to visually manifest on
subject's extremities.

1013
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,836
[Curtis screaming]

1014
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:04,339
This is what you're
here to protect.

1015
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:06,280
It doesn't make any sense.

1016
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:08,509
You trusted them.
They lied to you.

1017
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:11,118
They used you, Sam.

1018
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,712
If he perfected xenogenesis--

1019
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:15,950
Christ, don't you get it?

1020
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:18,618
It's this place. It's hell.
It always was.

1021
01:13:22,364 --> 01:13:23,991
This shit ends here.

1022
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,166
What are you doing?

1023
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,999
We need to destroy
these discs.

1024
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,595
That's UAC property.

1025
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,608
Fuck UAC, we take this back,
they'll just--

1026
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,934
We take the data back.

1027
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:40,438
Sarge, do you not see
what's going on here?
I didn't see shit.

1028
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,550
And I ain't paid to see shit.

1029
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:45,479
I have my orders.
And so do you.

1030
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:49,657
Is this everything?

1031
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:53,519
I said, is this everything?

1032
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:57,160
I, uh, have three
more to download.
Then do it.

1033
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:05,901
[gun firing]

1034
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:11,868
(Kid)
Sarge?

1035
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:13,905
We got a problem.

1036
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:16,041
(Kid on radio)
One dead scientist is missing.

1037
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:17,908
Now.

1038
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,390
You just wanna leave her here?

1039
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:24,350
She's got a job to do.

1040
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:31,662
Look, this is Portman's comm.
You call if you need help,
okay?

1041
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:35,967
You gonna be all right?

1042
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:39,334
I'll be fine.

1043
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:41,440
Okay. I'll see you soon.

1044
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,907
(Sarge on radio)
Pinky, are you there? Pinky.

1045
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:51,612
Sarge? Something is cutting
through the Ark door.

1046
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,119
You have a visual?

1047
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:55,551
(Pinky)
Oh, I got a visual all right.

1048
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,588
Don't let it get to the Ark!

1049
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,184
(female computer voice)
Five.

1050
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:00,853
Pinky, use the grenade!
Four.

1051
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:02,725
Use the goddamn grenade!
Three, two.

1052
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:04,565
Throw it!
One.

1053
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:24,145
(Sarge)
Pinky's gone. That fucker ran.

1054
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:25,208
Shit.

1055
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:26,751
It got through.

1056
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:28,551
What the hell is that?

1057
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:29,989
(computer voice)
System reboot.

1058
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:33,755
Time required to begin
renewed operation.:
five minutes.

1059
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,387
Quarantine cordon is breached.

1060
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,432
This mission is
no longer containment.

1061
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:39,865
Get all the weapons and ammo
you can. We're going through.

1062
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:40,924
Move!

1063
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:42,570
Sam, come in. Over.

1064
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:44,799
Sam, do you read me? Over.
Come in!

1065
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,698
She's not answering.

1066
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:49,907
Time required to begin
renewed operation...

1067
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:52,378
four minutes and 45 seconds.

1068
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:53,943
You got three.

1069
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:02,652
Sam! Come in, Sam!

1070
01:16:14,937 --> 01:16:15,961
Sam!

1071
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:18,230
Sam, why didn't you answer
your comm? We gotta go now!

1072
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:20,138
Why did they take Goat
and not Destroyer?

1073
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,176
Why Carmack
and not Dr. Thurman?

1074
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,235
What?
Lucy had
the 24th chromosome...

1075
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:25,302
but she wasn't a monster.

1076
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:28,508
She died protecting her child,
not devouring it.

1077
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:31,250
Why did the same chromosome
that made her superhuman...

1078
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,185
turn Stahl into a monster?

1079
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,189
Let's go.
Just give me a minute.

1080
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:38,124
We don't have a minute.
Then give me 10 seconds.

1081
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:42,329
This is its tongue.

1082
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:45,099
This is brain matter
from Portman.

1083
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:47,431
[hissing]

1084
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:52,099
This is from Destroyer.

1085
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:01,475
It's choosing, John.

1086
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:04,242
It's choosing who to infect.

1087
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:06,818
It's choosing?
How is it choosing?

1088
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:10,380
There are genetic markers
for psychotic
and violent behavior.

1089
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,388
It could be a specific
neurotransmitter...

1090
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,589
it's picking up on,
a ganglion.

1091
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:18,195
Latching onto numbers
in the DNA code linked to--

1092
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,996
Linked to what? Evil?

1093
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:23,729
Ten percent of the human
genome is still unmapped.

1094
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:26,638
Some say it's the genetic
blueprint for the soul.

1095
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:30,235
Maybe C-24 is what destroyed
the population.

1096
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:33,343
It would explain
why some of them
had to build the Ark...

1097
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:35,315
to escape to a new beginning.

1098
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:39,751
Some it made superhuman.
Others, monsters.

1099
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,250
Oh, my God.

1100
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:45,519
We gotta get out of here now.
What?

1101
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:47,619
Come on, let's go, come on.

1102
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:49,921
The people quarantined on
the other side of the Ark...

1103
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,329
they won't all be infected!

1104
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:52,765
What's going on?

1105
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:56,861
Sarge is going to
kill them all. Come on.

1106
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:02,703
We uphold quarantine.
Nothing gets to the elevator
back on Earth.

1107
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:04,803
We can't let them
get to the surface.

1108
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,973
If it breathes, kill it.
(female computer voice)
Five...

1109
01:18:07,082 --> 01:18:09,516
four, three...

1110
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:12,419
two, one.

1113
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:25,733
This is
Corporal Dean Portman...

1114
01:18:25,801 --> 01:18:28,929
with RRTS 6 Special Ops
on Olduvai, 0310 hours.

1115
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:32,233
We have encountered
hostile activity.

1116
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:36,106
Require immediate
RRTS reinforcements.

1117
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,003
Yeah, no shit.

1118
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,743
We got 58 minutes before
the auto lockdown is lifted.

1119
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:44,241
Reset it
for another six hours.

1120
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,150
(Duke)
I can't. It's been disabled.

1121
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:48,388
Same as the topside comm link.

1122
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:50,015
They're disabling
computers now?

1123
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:52,287
Yeah,
they're rocket scientists,
remember?

1124

1128
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:06,459
(John)
Oh, my God.

1129
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,562
Sarge,
what's your position?

1130
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:14,631
[screaming]

1131
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:23,373
Sarge.

1132
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:25,749
Sarge, come in.
Do you copy?

1133
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:28,251
Come in, Sarge.
Do you read me? Over.

1134
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,915
Sarge, come in,
do you copy?

1135
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:31,715
Loud and clear.

1136
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:33,226
(John on radio)
Look, do not kill everybody.

1137
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,126
I repeat,
do not kill everybody.

1138
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:36,528
Help me.
They're not all infected.

1139
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:38,896
Help me, help me, please.
Do you copy?

1140
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:41,531
Copy that.
(man)
Help me.

[gun firing]

1142
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:52,068
Clear the rest of this sector
and meet back
at the Ark chamber.

(Pinky)
Jesus Christ,
what the hell are--

1145
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:16,303
Who the hell's in there?

1146
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:21,297
Well, don't just stand there,
you dumb son of a bitch.
Help me up.

1147
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,579
[baby crying]

1148
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:28,271
It's okay.

1149
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:39,782
Please...

1150
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:42,457
help us.

1151
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:47,828
(Samantha)
You don't have to
kill all of them.

1152
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:52,733
I don't think everyone
is infected, or even capable
of being infected.

1153
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:57,675
We have orders
to contain this threat
by any means necessary.

1154
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:00,180
(John)
So let's evacuate
the uninfected...

1155
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:02,214
and blow this place to hell.

1156
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:04,218
And we have orders
to protect this facility.

1157
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:06,481
We don't have orders
to kill innocent people.

1158
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:12,760
(Sarge)
We have to stop anything
from getting to the surface...

1159
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:15,628
by any means...

1160
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:17,255
necessary.

1161
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:21,327
Found this little chicken shit
hiding under a pile
of dead bodies.

1162
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:22,961
Am I glad to see you guys.

1163
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:25,199
That thing
cut right through the door.

1164
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:28,333
I tried to use the grenade
but it came at me too fast.

1165
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:32,308
Followed me through the Ark
and started to kill everybody.

1166
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:34,005
It was horrible.

1167
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:37,483
There's no wound on his neck.
He's clean.

1168
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:42,813
I say who's clean...

1169
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,493
and who's not.

1170
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,990
[gun cocking]
I mean, it wasn't my fault.

1171
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:52,795
Hey, I'm not a soldier.
You shouldn't have left me--

1172
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:53,856
(Kid)
Sarge.

1173
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:58,764
There's a storeroom
to the south.

1174
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,274
It's got, like, 20 people
holed up inside of it.

1175
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:02,935
We gotta do something.

1176
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:06,376
Your orders were
to clear that sector.

1177
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,078
Is it cleared?

1178
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:11,515
No, I told them to stay put.

1179
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:14,421
They're okay.
They're just scared shitless.

1180
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:16,049
We kill them all.

1181
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,020
Let God sort them out.

1182
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:24,893
This is wrong.

1183
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:27,427
I think--
Son, you don't think.

1184
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:31,303
That's an order.

1185
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:35,039
We're in the field, soldier.

1186
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:36,871
Sarge,
if nothing's found them--

1187
01:23:36,945 --> 01:23:40,711
You will obey
the direct order...

1188
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:44,414
of your commanding officer.

1189
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:53,620
No.

1190
01:23:56,564 --> 01:23:57,724
Now.

1191
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:00,960
Go to hell.

1192
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:02,833
[gun firing]
No!

1193
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:05,163
No.
Holy shit.

1194
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:19,212
(Sarge)
Mutinous insurrection
is punishable...

1195
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:21,744
by death.

1196
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:29,458
It was his first mission!
And it's not gonna be
my last.

1197
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:31,264
(Sarge)
I need soldiers.

1198
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:34,592
I don't need anybody else
but soldiers.

1199
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,337
(Pinky)
Drop the weapons.

1200
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:12,831
I mean it.

1201
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:16,904
I have no intention
of being killed by a madman.
Drop the weapons.

1202
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:20,746
[snarling]

Wait here.

1211
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:17,059

Withdraw behind the nanowall.

I can't see. I can't see.

Clear.

1229
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:45,384
How long
before they get through?

1230
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:47,984
Not long.

1231
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:51,221
(Samantha)
You've been hit.

1232
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:52,995
Oh, John.

1233
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:10,041
Listen to me, Sam.

You're cold. Shivering.

It's important.

This is an ST grenade.

When they come through...

1238
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:27,160
you pop the top
and hit the button.

1239
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:33,473
John, stay with me.
Stay awake.

It's C-24.
It's from Carmack's lab.
No.

1244
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:51,387
It could save you.
No way, forget it.

1245

You're bleeding to death.

No way, Sam.

one of those demons.

One through the heart,

don't you hesitate. Okay?
