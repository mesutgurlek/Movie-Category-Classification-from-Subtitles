00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,477
What do you think I want, you mean,
old bastard? I want a fuckin' room.

150
00:11:28,552 --> 00:11:29,981

from better to bad to worse ~

00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:41,479
Do they have cable?

154
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:43,716
No.

155
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:47,711
- Do they have the X-rated channel?
- No.

156
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:50,469
- Do they have a water bed?
- Nope.

157
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:54,050
- What do they got?
- They have four walls and a roof
and that's all we need.

You, plant yourself in that seat.

- What are you gonna do with me?
- I said "plant yourself."
Plants don't talk.

Now,you wanna get on my goodside?
You sit still and you don't make a peep.

- How do you think--
It hurts like a son of a bitch.

166

- It's wrapped too tight. Nice and easy.
- Okay.

- Good. I'm goin' to
the border, check things out.

171

I'm gonna call Carlos.
Try and arrange some sort
of a rendezvous. I don't know what.

Could you see if he could
arrange a better deal than 30%?

00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:27,045
It's a standard deal.
They're not gonna change that for us.

and negotiate with them?

firecracker sales men from Tijuana.

So it is written, so shall it be done.
Yeah, I know, listen.

Hey, you want sanctuary, you gotta
pay the price. The price is 30%.

Okay?

We need to have a talk.

- What's your name?
- Gloria.

184
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:06,253
Hello, Gloria. I'm Seth. That's my
brother Richie. Let's cut to the chase.

185
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:10,573
I'm gonna ask you one question,
and all I want is a yes or no answer.

186
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,526
Do you wanna live
through this?

187
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:14,565
- Yes.
- Good.

188
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:19,242
Rule number one:
No noise. No questions.

189
00:14:19,343 --> 00:14:22,277
If you make a noise,

190
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:24,619
Mr..44 makes a noise.

191
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,465
If you ask a question,
Mr..44 answers it.

192
00:14:27,727 --> 00:14:32,200
Now are you absolutely,
positively clear about rule number one?

193
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,367
- Yes.
- Rule number two:

194
00:14:36,432 --> 00:14:38,439
You do what we say
when we say it.

195

If you don't...
see rule number one.

Rule number three: Don't you ever
try and fucking run on us,

you follow the rules,

and you don't fuck with us, and
you'll get out of this alive.

which is right next
to the border.

- [Boy] Stop?

at a motel, are we?
- Yeah, what for?

214
00:16:50,005 --> 00:16:53,899
We have a motor home.
We don't wanna stay
in those roach-haven motels, do we?

just one night's sleep
in a honest to goodness bed.

222

The beds in the home
are okay, but...

223
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:25,846
they're not like a real bed.

Excuse me.
I have to use the restroom.

225

Oh, guess what? When I called
the machine to check the messages,

226
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:46,225
um, one of them
was from Bethel Baptist.

227

said that...

he wouldn't permanently replace you
until we came back.

- That's very nice of Ted.

and tell him not to bother waiting.

in front of Scott
because he gets upset.

233

But I just wanna know...

234
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,595
don't you believe
in God anymore?

235
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:20,786
Not enough to be a pastor.

Look, I know this is hard
on you kids.

the last thing you need, but...

my congregation needs
spiritual leadership.

239
00:18:34,394 --> 00:18:37,394
Well... my faith is gone.

240
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:42,386
To answer your question,
yes, I do believe in...Jesus.

241
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,264
Yes, I do believe in God.

242
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:49,079
But do I love Them?

243
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:51,001
No.

244
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:54,995
Well, it's just that all our lives,
you've been a pastor.

245
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:57,237
And then...

246
00:18:57,338 --> 00:19:00,654
one day you're just gonna
wake up and say, "Fuck Him"?

247
00:19:02,523 --> 00:19:04,377
I didn't say, "Fuck Him."

248
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:09,330
Every person who...

249
00:19:09,435 --> 00:19:13,974
chooses the service of God as his
life's work has something in common.

250
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:17,490
I don't care if
you're a preacher, a priest,

00:19:17,596 --> 00:19:20,313
a nun, a rabbi
or a Buddhist monk.

252
00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:25,562
Many, many times during your life you'll
look at your reflection in the mirror...

253
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,699
and ask yourself,

254
00:19:27,963 --> 00:19:30,352
"Am I a fool?"

255
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,809
I'm not going through a lapse.

256
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:37,232
What I've experienced
is closer to awakening.

257
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:40,535
Daddy?

258
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:43,451
What do you think
Mom would say?

259
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:47,673
Mama's got nothin' to say.
She's dead.

260
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:53,848
This bloody crime spree started
just a week ago today.

261
00:19:53,949 --> 00:19:56,763
The oldest of the two brothers,
Seth Gecko,

262
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:00,603
was serving time in Rollings,
Kansas State Penitentiary...

263
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:03,996
for his part in the 1988
Scott City bank robbery...

264
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:06,580
in which two law enforcement
officers lost their lives.

265
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:11,419
It was while at the courthouse that this
man, his younger brother, Richard Gecko,

266
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:16,186
a known armed robber and sex offender
pulled off a daring daylight escape,

267
00:20:16,254 --> 00:20:21,720
resulting in the death of
four Wichita law enforcement officers,
and this woman,

268
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:25,017
Heidi Vogel, sixth grade teacher,
who was run over by the Geckos...

269
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:27,801
during a high-speed pursuit
through downtown Wichita.

270
00:20:27,902 --> 00:20:32,179
And earlier today, during a daylight
liquor store robbery in Big Springs,

271
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:35,384
the Gecko brothers killed
another Texas Ranger,

272
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:39,479
Earl McGraw, and liquor store clerk,
Pete Bottoms.

273
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:42,136
That changes the death toll to 16;

274
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:46,198
five Texas Rangers, eight police
officers, three civilians.

275
00:20:46,303 --> 00:20:50,613
And one hostage, bank teller
and mother off our, Gloria Hill.

276
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:55,356
For the time being, we're very
confident that we'll apprehend
these fugitives within 48 hours.

277
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:58,172
The Bureau, local law enforcement
and the Texas Rangers...

278
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:02,646
have all joined in forming a dragnet
to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.

279
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,850
Is it safe to assume that because
of the death count involved...

280
00:21:05,952 --> 00:21:08,854
and the loss of life
of law enforcement officers,

281
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,629
that the Bureau, the Rangers
and the police force are taking
this manhunt personally?

282
00:21:13,728 --> 00:21:16,477
I would say that's
a very safe assumption.

- They're gonna apprehend us
in about 48 hours.

I gotta figure out a way
to get us across this goddamn border.

ain't worth shit. Here you go.

00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:14,457
Richard, where is she?

297
00:22:15,522 --> 00:22:17,344
She's in there.

298
00:22:17,442 --> 00:22:19,995
- What the fuck is she doin' in there?
- Seth, wait a minute.

299
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:21,921
Seth.

300
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:35,262
Richard, what's wrong with you?

301
00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:39,968
- Before you flip out, okay, let
me just explain what happened.
- Ex--Explain to me.

302
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,961
I need an explanation.
What is the matter with you?

303
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:48,125
There's nothing wrong with me,
brother. That woman tried to
escape and I did what I had to.

304
00:22:48,228 --> 00:22:50,846
No, the woman wouldn't have said shit
if she had a mouth full of it.

305
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:52,835
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

306
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:54,786
- Yeah.
- After you left,

307
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:58,626
- she became a completely
different person.
- Yeah.

308
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,122
Is it me?
Is it my fault?

309
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:06,562
- It's not your fault.
- Is this my fault?

310
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,140
- No, it's her fault.
It's not your fault.
- Is this my fault?

311
00:23:10,244 --> 00:23:12,578
Do you think that
this is what I am?

312
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:16,735
- I don't.
- This is not me. I am
a professional fucking thief.

313
00:23:16,837 --> 00:23:21,212
I don't kill people that I don't have
to and I don't fucking rape women.

314
00:23:21,285 --> 00:23:24,546
What you are doing--
What you are fucking doing--

315
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:28,801
What you are doing is not how it's done.
Do you understand that? Do you?

316
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:32,217
Just say, "Fucking yes."
Say, "Yes, Seth, I understand."

317
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:35,740
- Yes, Seth, I understand.
- Say it. Say, "Yes, Seth,
I fucking understand!"

318
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:38,879
I understand, Seth.
I fucking understand.

319
00:23:44,198 --> 00:23:48,126
We'll get to Mexico,
and it's gonna be sweet rosemary
and a hundred proof liquor...

320
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,158
[Sighs] and rice and beans and none
of this shit's gonna matter.

321
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:04,512
I can't believe he's stoppin' here.
This place is totally cruddy.

- [Door Closes]
- Dad, why are we stoppin' here?

323
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,605
There's nothin' wrong
with this... place.

324
00:24:17,703 --> 00:24:20,485
- [Engine Starts]
- It's a flophouse.

325
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:23,550
It's not a flophouse.

326
00:24:23,655 --> 00:24:26,338
It's basic and it's simple.

327
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:29,221
That doesn't make it
a flophouse.

328
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,003
All right. Well,
if it doesn't have a pool,

329
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,624
then we're goin' someplace else.

330
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,862
It has a bed.

331
00:24:37,928 --> 00:24:40,677
That's all I care about.

332
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:43,165
Well, other places
have beds, too,

333
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:45,955

this guy's problem?

336
00:24:57,545 --> 00:24:59,846
No idea.

337

348
00:25:52,587 --> 00:25:57,060
If it's not too much trouble,
could I possibly borrow yours?
I'll bring it right back.

- It's called a punch.

Wide!

Let's go. Let's move
the Jap over here too. Let's go.

00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:44,746
So what's the story with you two?
You a couple offags?

- He's my son.
- How's that happen?
You don't look Japanese.

362

Neither does he.
He looks Chinese.

Oh, ooh, well
excuse me all to hell.

- It's about money,
all right, but not yours.

My brother and I, we're in a little
hot water and we need your assistance.

um, goin' on?

We're having a bikini contest,
and you just won.

It's okay, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.

Just listen to your daddy, sugar,
and you don't do anything stupid.

You two, Simon says
sit the fuck down.

Sit down.

373
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:28,937
Now... where are the keys
to the motor home?

- On the dresser.
- Good. All right,

you start this big bastard up
and drive it up front.

You got three minutes. One second
longer, I shoot your father in the face.

- Yes.

- Yes.

You damn well better. Go.

Look, if you want
the motor home,

just take it and get out.

We're gonna go on a little ride.

Sorry, Pops.
I need everybody.

My children are not goin'
with you, and that's that.

That's not fucking that.

You, go sit over there.
Go sit over there, now. Move it.

00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:19,304
Sit down.

398
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,009
Now, I don't have time to fuck around,
so I'm gonna make this simple.

399
00:29:25,076 --> 00:29:27,793
You take your kids
and you get in that motor home...

400
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:30,859
or I will execute
all three of you right now.

401
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,665
So, what's it gonna be?

402
00:29:35,764 --> 00:29:38,382
Yes or no answer.

Yes.

- Where are you takin' us?
- Mexico.

411
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,641
Mexicans.

00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,214
- Richie?
- Yeah?

413
00:30:23,318 --> 00:30:25,260
Put in your bit.

422
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,501
Yes, she is.

424
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:09,495
Auto wreck.

425
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:16,271
Come on,Jacob, gimme some
more details. How'd it happen?
Some fucking drunk kill her?

426
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:19,343
No. It was a rainy night.

427
00:31:21,592 --> 00:31:24,690
The brakes on the car
weren't great.

428
00:31:24,793 --> 00:31:27,476
She had to stop suddenly.

429
00:31:27,577 --> 00:31:31,155
She slid on the road.
She crashed. She died.

430
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:34,104
- She died right away?
- Not quite.

431
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:39,127
She was trapped in the wreck
for about... six hours...

432
00:31:39,225 --> 00:31:41,330
before she passed on.

433
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:46,550
Yep. Those acts of God really stick
it in and break it off, don't they?

434
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:49,780
Yes, they do.

435
00:31:49,881 --> 00:31:52,302
Is that real?

436
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:55,725
- Yes.
- I've seen one of these things before.

437
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:59,444
A friend of mine had himself ordained
a minister of his own religion.

438
00:31:59,546 --> 00:32:04,947
Some way to fuck the I.R.S.
Is that what you're doing,
or are you the real McCoy?

439
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:06,927
The real McCoy.

440
00:32:08,922 --> 00:32:13,013
- You're a preacher?
- [Inhales Deeply] I was a minister.

"Was" as in not anymore?

- Yes.
- Why'd you quit?

443
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:19,640
I think I've gotten about...

444
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:23,087
as up close and personal
with you as I'm gonna get.

445

Let's just keep this friendly, okay,
Pops? Let's not get too sensitive.

You're right. Enough with
the gettin'-to-know-you shit. All right.

00:32:33,499 --> 00:32:36,499
I don't give a rat's ass about you
or your fuckin' family.

448
00:32:36,603 --> 00:32:40,083
You can all live forever,
or you can die this second.

449

And I don't
give a shit which.

450
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:44,176
The only things that
I care about are me,

So you help us get across
the border without incident,

and in the morning I'm gonna
let you guys go, all of you.

456
00:32:57,052 --> 00:33:02,289
How do I know you'll keep your word?
You have to convince me
you're tellin' the truth.

457
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:05,299
Look, dick-head, the only thing
that you have to be convinced about...

458
00:33:05,404 --> 00:33:09,048
is the fact that you are
stuck in a situation with a couple
of real mean motor scooters.

459
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:12,313
I don't want to have to worry
about you all fuckin'night.

460
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:15,195
I don't think you wanna be worrying
about my brother's intentions...

- Yes.

- You didn't like it, did you?
- No, I didn't.

464
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:25,938
I didn't think so.
You get us into Mexico,

465
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:29,750
and you don't try to escape,
and your daughter will be safe.

466
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:34,327
And in the morning I will let you go.
I give you my word,Jacob.

467
00:33:37,022 --> 00:33:40,218
If he touches her,
I'll kill him!

468

I'll kill all of ya.

that for you, I will. I'd be happy to.

- What?
- I told you to watch those kids.
Not to talk to them.

486

You don't have nothin' to say to one
another, so let's just cut the chatter.
