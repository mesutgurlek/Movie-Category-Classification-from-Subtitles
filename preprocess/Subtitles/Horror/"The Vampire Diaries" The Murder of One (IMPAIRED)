00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,130
FORBES: Someone drove this stake
through his heart.

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,589
I'd know if I were killing.

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,758
You wear a ring that lets you cheat death.

5
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,261
How many times can you die
before it changes you?

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,515
- What are you doing here, Sage?
- I heard Finn was freed from that casket.

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,891
He's my one true love.

8
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,019
Esther's planning on killing her family.

9
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,939
She's linked them all together.
Whatever happens to one happens to all.

10
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:29,194
It's not over, Nik. A white oak tree 300
years after we fled back to the old world.

11
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,281
- That tree could kill us.
- 1912, Salvatore Milling Company...

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,493
...chopped down an old white oak tree
used to make the Wickery Bridge.

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,913
- We have a weapon.
- Let's go kill some Originals.

14
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,135
Morning, sunshine.

15
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,679
Hey. How's Alaric?

16
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,681
Indecent. But fine.

17
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,559
So then does that mean
there was no issues last night?

18
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,020
Nope. Slept like a baby. Woke up Alaric.

19
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,314
No headlines
about dead Council members.

20
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,442
Then why do I feel like
you're hiding something from me?

21
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,946
Maybe because you're being all paranoid
and control freaky?

22
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,990
What'd you bring me?

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,118
Ooh, chocolate muffins.
You know what they say.

24
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,829
The way to a killer's heart
is through his stomach.

25
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,247
They're not for you.

26
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,042
Fine. Keep convincing yourself
you're still mad at me.

27
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,795
But sadly, Ric's gonna have to miss
Elena time today.

28
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,797
You know, lockdown and all.

29
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,258
Just take it, give it to him,
and tell him that I miss him, okay?

30
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,885
- With pleasure.
ELENA: Please.

31

Have a great day. Thanks for coming by.

Walking down the stairs.

34

Opening front door...

35
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,527
...and she's gone.

36
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,961
STEFAN: This needs a sharper point.
- Got it.

37
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,048
We have stakes to kill an Original.
Not gonna miss because you can't whittle.

38
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,051
I said, I got it. Stop micromanaging.

39
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,555
If you guys got this under control,
I'm gonna call the sheriff.

40
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:23,058
- I wanna turn myself in.
- No, you don't.

41
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,395
I have a homicidal alter ego.
Unlike some people in this room...

42
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,898
...I would like to take responsibility
for the people I've killed.

43
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,277
If you wanted to turn yourself in,
you wouldn't be saying it.

44
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,572
You cannot psychoanalyze me.
I killed Caroline's father.

45
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,032
I nearly killed Meredith.
Everything's changed.

46
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,077
You're not turning yourself in.
Bonnie's herbs are working...

47
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,912
...and we have Originals to kill.

48
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,082
His morals get questionable
when he has revenge on the brain.

49
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,169
Klaus needs to die.
We finally have the chance to kill him.

50
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,796
So you are not turning yourself in.

51
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,262
Here's your ring, Ric. Put it on.

52
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,764
That ring is the reason
I've killed people.

53
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,975
DAMON:
It's also the reason you're alive.

54
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,604
You're going vampire hunting, Ric.
Wear it.

55
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,949
CAROLINE:
Alaric Saltzman killed my father?

56
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,410
I can't expect you to be okay with this...

57
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,206
...but these herbs that Bonnie's
giving him, they're healing him...

58
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,124
...and keeping the dark side buried.

59
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,710
Yeah, and that's supposed
to make everything okay?

60
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,091
No, it's not okay. It's horrible,
and I feel horrible about it, but...

61
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,846
He's a victim of something supernatural.
He didn't ask for this.

62
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,390
It just happened to him,
just like Bonnie's mom.

63
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,644
She didn't ask to become a vampire...

64
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,438
...and neither did Stefan or Tyler.

65
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,982
Or me.

66
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,153
Or you.

67
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,991
None of you asked for this.

68
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:08,872
But who would I be
if I just turned my back on any of you?

69
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,213
Oh, Elena Gilbert.

Hey. What's with the cryptic
secret-meeting text?

72
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,264
I don't know.
Stefan just said to meet here.

73
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:28,850
Where's Bonnie? I texted her too.

74
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,520
Uh, Bonnie's mom bailed on her again.

75
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,148
- So I think we should leave her out.
- What are we doing here?

76
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,610
I found some more white oak.
Long story, wait for the movie.

77
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,115
Hang on. White oak?
You have a weapon that can kill Klaus?

78
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,659
Nope. We all have a weapon.

79
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:56,003
- Hello, Finn.
- Hello, Niklaus.

80
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,214
- I have nothing to say to you.
KLAUS: Well, I'm not here to chat.

81
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,967
I will ask you one time, though.
Where's our mother?

82
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,553
Gone to find another way
to end our lives.

83
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:08,890
And when she does,
I will sacrifice myself all over again.

84
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,853
How fortunate that I found you.
I require your assistance.

85
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,064
I have no wish to help you.
Only to see you dead.

86
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,734
Right. You see,
you won't be able to see me dead...

87
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:21,862
...because if I die, then you die,
so wish unfulfilled.

Bother someone else
with your hollow charms.

89
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,408
Why, when I can bother my big brother?

90
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,910
I need you to accompany me
back to Mystic Falls.

91
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,706
I have a witch who can help undo
Esther's spell that linked us together.

92
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,835
- I have no wish to be unlinked.
- Again with the wishes.

93
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,505
Let me rephrase. You will come back
with me or I will put you back...

94
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,175
...in that coffin
in which you rotted for 900 years.

95
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,927
What happens to one happens to all.

96
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,263
You may not feel
the effects of the dagger...

97
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,390
...but you'd lose your precious Rebekah.

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,560
Wouldn't be the first time.

99

Let's not make this any worse
than it has to be, darling brother.

100
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,282
You're siding with him?
Rebekah, he stored us in boxes.

101
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,826
At least he's not trying
to make us extinct.

102
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,831
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

103
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,501
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You've got a death wish.

104
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,378
Fine. Pathetic, but fine.

105
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,506
The thing is I'm not gonna let you
take the rest of us down with you.

But now we have the advantage.

110
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,810
We're all armed and they are all linked.

111
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,437
Meaning we only need
to kill one of them.

112
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,731
We need to seize the best opportunity...

...which means we need
to prepare for every opportunity.

Scenario number one.
You get to play Klaus.

- Okay.
- Rebekah is our target.

116
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,827
We'll distract her, catch her off guard.

117
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,789
To do that, we need to keep Klaus
separate and occupied.

- Why do I always have to be Klaus bait?

He's obsessed with you. But for right
now we need you to play Rebekah.

We use the quarterback to distract her.
Keep her talking.

- Act interested. She's lonely, desperate.

I come up from behind her...

...grab her arms like this.
- Ow.

125
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,980
Which gives me time for one shot.

126
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,941
Got it? Good.
So we all have one stake.

We keep it hidden, and we look out
for any opportunity we have.

All right. Let's try another scenario.
