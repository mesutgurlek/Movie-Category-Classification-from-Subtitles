1
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
My name is Alice.

2
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,700
I worked for
the Umbrella Corporation...

3
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,100
...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.

4
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,700
I was head of security...

5
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,400
...at a secret high-tech facility
called The Hive...

6
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,900
...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental...

7
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,800
...viral weaponry.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,400
But there was an incident.

9
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,400
The virus escaped
and everybody died.

10
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,400
Trouble was...

11
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,600
...they didn't stay dead.

12
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,100
The T-virus reanimated their bodies.

13
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,600
But I survived.
Myself and one other...

14
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,500
...an environmentalist named Matt.

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,400
When we emerged, we were
seized by Umbrella scientists.

16
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,900
Matt and I were separated.

17
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,700
He's mutating. I want him
in the Nemesis Program.

18
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,100
Matt!

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,700
Take her to the
Raccoon City facility...

20
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,600
...and assemble the team.

21
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,400
We're reopening The Hive.

22
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,000
I want to know
what went on down there.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,900
We thought we'd
survived the horror.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But we were wrong.

25
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,000
You're watching Raccoon 7.
Now the weather, with Terri Morales.

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,600
It's 6:10 in the a.m. And already
the temperature has reached...

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,200
...a massive 92 degrees as this
unprecedented heat wave continues.

28
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,000
Clear skies in Raccoon City and a
light breeze coming in from the west.

29
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,500
And as a special bonus just for you,
we have a pollen count of 0. 7.

30
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,800
That's a record low
for this time of year.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,800
Good news for all you hay fever
and asthma sufferers.

32
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,800
All in all, it looks like it's goanna be
another beautiful day.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,700
Stay with us. After the break...

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,900
...we're goanna look at your favourite
holiday hot spots.

35
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,300
Advance team, proceed.

36
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,100
Sir.

37
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Holy shit.

38
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,300
Excuse us, ma'am.
There's been an incident.

39
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,100
Excuse us, sir.
There's been an incident.

40
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,300
How bad is it?

41
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,000
- You must come with us.
- I must get my daughter.

42
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,300
- It's taken care of.
- What are you doing?

43
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,900
You don't understand.
She's left for school.

44
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,200
This is U-Gamma 7,
evacuation complete...

45
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,600
...but we just lost contact
with Gamma 12.

46
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,400
Unit 12 calling for immediate backup
at city hall.

47
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,000
Still no explanation for this wave
of unexplained killings...

48
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,400
...that is sweeping across the city.

49
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,100
A deadly crime spree with no end.

50
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,800
Backup, we need backup now!

51
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,100
Just like Valentine told us...

52
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,900
Off-duty law enforcement personnel,
report for duty immediately.

53
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,800
Give us a hand over here,
this guy's insane!

54
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,800
- It's Valentine.
- Hold your fire.

55
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,500
- Valentine!
- They're infected.

56
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,000
Somebody get this ugly bitch
off of me!

57
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,500
I told you. Shoot for the head.

58
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,800
Please, somebody get her.

59
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,800
No! Don't shoot! Don't...

60
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,200
I'm leaving town.
I suggest you do the same.

61
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,900
Everyone's leaving the city.

62
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,600
We've received reports
of Umbrella Corporation...

63
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,200
...dispatching armed guards
and troop carriers.

64
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Move in an orderly fashion
to security checkpoints.

65
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,300
The city is completely contained.
Troops have sealed all exits.

66
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,200
The only way out is this bridge.

67
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,300
All citizens must pass through
medical scanning.

68
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,300
Sir! You better take a look at this.

69
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,900
Family members must pass through
security checkpoints together.

70
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,500
Please proceed in an orderly fashion.
Do not run.

71
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,700
- He's clean. Let him pass.
- Next!

72
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,200
No pushing, please. Keep in line.

73
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,800
Can we get some
reinforcements down here?

74
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,300
Chopper Delta, new orders.

75
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Proceed directly to
Ravens Gate Bridge.

76
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,300
Reinforcements urgently needed.

77
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,600
Copy that, base. On our way.

78
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,500
Get it.

79
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,100
No! Get off!

80
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,000
Get away! No! Stop! Get off!

81
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,900
No! Get back!

82
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,700
Civilian in trouble. Three o'clock.
Go down.

83
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,500
I can't. We have our orders.

84
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,900
No! Get back! No!

85
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,200
They're goanna kill her!
Take us down now!

86
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,200
She's a civilian. We have orders.

87
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,000
Fuck orders!

88
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,900
Nicholai, tie me off.

89
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,500
Get back! No!

90
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,100
Wait!

91
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,400
Now!

92
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,000
Take us down! Down, now!

93
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,200
Hey. Hey, you okay?

94
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,000
Step away from the edge.
Come over to me.

95
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,000
- Everything's okay.
- No, it's not.

96
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,600
I've seen what happens to you
once you've been bitten.

97
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,600
- We can help you.
- There's no going back.

98
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,200
No!

99
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,400
Move! Peyton!

100
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,500
- Peyton!
- Valentine. Hey, Valentine.

101
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,800
- Move! Police! Move!
- Let her through.

102
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,900
Glad you're here.
We could use the help.

103
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,200
- He has a weak heart.
- Get away from him!

104
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,000
Everybody, stand back!

105
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,900
- Daddy!
- Get away from him!

106
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,000
- Get her away from him!
- It's okay.

107
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,200
- Get her away!
- It's okay. Come on.

108
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
- Daddy!
- It's okay, I got you.

109
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,200
- Get him off! Get him off me!
- Move aside!

110
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
Get back!

111
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,900
It's here. It's reached the gate.

112
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,300
Why are you here? You should've
got out while you had the chance.

113
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,600
These are our people, Jill.

114
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,000
- Close them.
- Sir?

115
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,600
Seal the gates.

116
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,000
- Our men are still out there...
- Just do it.

117
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,700
Oh, my God, they're closing
the gates!

118
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,100
This is a biohazard quarantine area.

119
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,300
Due to risk of infection, you cannot
be allowed to leave the city.

120
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,400
What the fuck is going on here?

121
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,300
All appropriate measures
are being taken.

122
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,700
The situation is under control.

123
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
Please return to your homes.

124
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,900
You won't get away with this!

125
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,300
Let us out!

126
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
You have five seconds
to turn around...

127
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,400
...and return to the city.

128
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,300
Do it.

129
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,100
Use of live ammunition
has been authorized.

130
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,900
Five.

131
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,200
- They can't shoot people!
- They won't fire.

132
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,100
Three.

133
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,500
- Get them back!
- Two.

134
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,900
- Move!
- One.

135
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,700
Everybody, clear out!

136
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,400
Kilo and Romeo squads,
rendezvous at sector 01...

137
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,200
...and secure against enemy.

138
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,800
- Grenade!
- Grenade!

139
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,000
Squads three to seven
are on full retreat.

140
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,600
No, sir. Suppression measures
have failed. We can't contain it.

141
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,100
The infection is spreading faster
than anyone anticipated.

142
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,900
Dr. Ashford.

143
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,300
- Shouldn't you be on the chopper?
- I'm not going.

144
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,300
I was instructed to get you and
the other scientists out of the hot zone.

145
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,900
You're too important to Umbrella
to be at risk.

146
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,400
I'm not leaving without my daughter.

147
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,100
I'm sorry, truly.
But the city is sealed.

148
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,800
She may have survived the crash,
but we couldn't find her anywhere.

149
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,000
Even if she were still alive,
I couldn't let her out.

150
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,700
The risk of infection is too great.
You must understand.

151
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,300
You do what you have to do.

152
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,800
I'm staying.

153
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,000
There has to be someone left alive.

154
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,900
Come on.

155
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,100
- Matt!
- Take her to the Raccoon City facility.

156
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,200
I want her quarantined.
Close observation.

157
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,400
Prepare her for exposure.

158
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,900
Up the dosage.

159
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Just do it.

160
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,200
Inside.

161
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,100
Inside.

162
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,700
Let's get under cover.

163
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,300
You have to get out.

164
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,800
This is my place. I'm hiding here.

165
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,700
- It's big enough for all of us.
- Don't tell me...

166
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,700
Okay, just cool it. Put the gun down.

167
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,500
Put the gun down.

168
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,200
And, you, take it easy.

169
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,600
So does the Raccoon City
Police Department...

170
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,300
...have any comment
on what those things are?

171
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,600
What's that you got there?

172
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,800
My Emmy.

173
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,900
That's if any of us make it out.

174
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,100
Are you all right?

175
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,900
What are you doing?

176
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What's wrong?

177
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,700
It's my sister. She's not well.

178
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,100
- Maybe I can help.
- No.

179
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Out of my way.

180
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,100
Just get out.

181
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,100
You're feeding her? You're sick.

182
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,900
Just leave us alone.

183
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
No!

184
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,900
- I'm getting out of here.
- Hey.

185
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,300
Hey! Hey, no!

186
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,400
Oh, my God!

187
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,800
Hey, help us! Come on!

188
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,100
Get it in there!

189
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,500
What the hell was that?

190
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,300
There!

191
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,700
Jesus.

192
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,600
- What the fuck is that thing?
- What are you doing?

193
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,500
Get back here.

194
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,300
Peyton.

195
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,400
Terri.

196
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,900
Peyton.

197
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,300
I know.

198
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,700
I count three of them.

199
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,700
They got us boxed in.

200
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,500
What are we goanna do?

201
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,900
Let's go.

202
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,600
Jesus.

203
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,400
We're goanna need
more ammo. I'm out.

204
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,900
Shit. I'm out.

205
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,500
Move.

206
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,700
Who the fuck are you?

207
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,800
GTA, motherfucker!

208
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,900
Oh, yeah!

209
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,100
Ten points!

210
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,400
Yuri. You okay?

211
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,500
Bite this.

212
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,200
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

213
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,800
Pull back!

214
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,300
This way.

215
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,300
This is Olivera. We've been overrun.
Request immediate chopper evac.

216
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,100
We need to find somewhere
to stop for a moment.

217
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,000
I don't think that's a good idea.

218
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,800
There might be more of those...

219
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
...things.

220
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,600
If there were more,
we'd have seen them by now.

221
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,300
- You know what they are?
- They're bio-weapons...

222
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
...from Umbrella labs
beneath the city.

223
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,300
How come you know so much
about Umbrella?

224
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,100
I used to work for them.

225
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,500
Damn it.

226
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,300
Hold it.

227
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,100
What do you think you're doing?

228
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,700
He's wounded.
The infection's spreading.

229
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,100
I'm fine.

230
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,100
You should take care of him now.

231
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,500
It'll be more difficult later.

232
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,200
You know that.

233
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,900
No.

234
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,800
If it comes to that...

235
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,600
...I'll take care of it myself.

236
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,000
As you wish.

237
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,400
It's nothing personal.
But in an hour, maybe two...

238
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,100
...you'll be dead.

239
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,000
And moments later,
you'll become one of them.

240
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,200
You'll endanger your friends,
try to kill them...

241
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,700
...probably succeed.

242
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm sorry. That's just the way it is.

243
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,700
Help me!

244
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,600
There's too many of them.

245
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,400
Let's get out of here.
This way!

246
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,700
Sir, T-virus infection
has reached critical levels.

247
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,200
This is a perfect opportunity.

248
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Ensure all data streams
are recorded.

249
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,800
Activate Nemesis Program now.

250
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,800
- Hey!
- Here! We're down here!

251
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,000
- Hey!
- Come! We're here!

252
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:18,300
- Where are they going?
- They're landing there. Let's get Yuri!

253
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,900
- Come on, Yuri. We're getting out.
- We'll get you fixed up. Come.

254
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,500
Hold on, Yuri. We're almost there.

255
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,000
No. No! Don't leave!

256
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,600
- Down here! We're coming!
- They dropped something.

257
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,500
Maybe a radio. One that works.

258
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,500
Take Yuri.

259
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,500
Hold on, Yuri.

260
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,000
Nicholai, put me down.

261
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,600
Okay, rest here.

262
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,700
What is this?

263
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,300
Looks like weapon cases.

264
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,200
We don't need weapons.
We need evacuation!

265
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,000
These weren't meant for us.

266
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,500
Yuri!

267
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,200
Plenty to go around.

268
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,900
Don't shoot!

269
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,100
I got the power.

270
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,500
Thank you! Owe you one, man.

271
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,900
Shit!

272
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Maybe I was safer outside.

273
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,800
Get them guns out of my damn face.

274
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,100
Motherfucker, please. Look...

275
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,900
...my shit is custom.

276
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,100
What the fuck is that?

277
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,800
Shit!

278
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,200
You're going down,
you son of a bitch!

279
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,100
Fuck.

280
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,800
Deploy defensive formation.
Take him down.

281
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,500
You fuckers is crazy. Look at that guy,
got a rocket launcher.

282
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,600
- What do we have?
- A dozen armed men. Well organized.

283
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,500
- I'm surprised there's anyone left.
- They're S.T.A.R.S.

284
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,600
Special Tactics and Rescue Squad.
They're the best.

285
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,900
Fire!

286
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,000
Back! Fall back!

287
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,200
- Let's see how good they really are.
- Altering protocols.

288
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,600
S.T.A.R.S.

289
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,800
Oh, shit.

290
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,700
Respect.

291
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,000
Those were some pretty slick moves
back there.

292
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,500
I'm good...

293
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,700
...but I'm not that good.

294
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,000
- You should be thankful for that.
- What do you mean?

295
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,500
They did something to me.

296
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,400
I barely feel human anymore.

297
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:25,800
We should keep moving.
Before the sound attracts anything.

298
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,900
Keep moving.

299
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,500
- Hello?
- God, I thought you'd never answer.

300
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,200
- Who is this?
- I can get you out of the city.

301
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,900
All four of you.

302
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,500
But first we have
to come to an arrangement.

303
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,700
Are you ready to make a deal?

304
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,100
- Do we have a choice?
- Not if you want to live past tonight, no.

305
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,500
His name is Dr. Ashford and he...

306
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:16,700
Runs the genetics and viral research
division of Umbrella Corporation.

307
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,200
What's he want with us?

308
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,800
His daughter, Angela,
is trapped in the city.

309
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,700
Umbrella was to evac her,
but she didn't make it.

310
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,600
She's hiding out in her school.

311
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,700
We find her, he'll help us escape
the perimeter.

312
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,100
No fucking deal.

313
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,200
We find the building with
the thickest walls and doors...

314
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,700
...and we barricade ourselves in.
Sit tight, wait for help.

315
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,900
There won't be any help.

316
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,900
Umbrella knows
they can't contain the infection.

317
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,300
So at sunrise this morning, Raccoon
City will be completely sanitized.

318
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,600
What do you mean by "sanitized"?

319
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,300
A precision tactical nuclear device.

320
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,400
- What yield?
- Five kilotons.

321
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,700
- Fuck me.
- Stupid.

322
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,700
- What does that mean?
- It means it'll destroy the infection...

323
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,500
...and all evidence of it.

324
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,300
It's bullshit. It's bullshit!

325
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,800
No fucking way would they
get away with that!

326
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,600
- It would be all over the fucking news!
- Cover-up.

327
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,500
Cover-up's already prepared.

328
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,500
A meltdown
at the nuclear power plant.

329
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,300
- A tragic accident.
- Not even Umbrella is capable of this.

330
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,100
Not capable?

331
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,600
Peyton, you were there at the bridge.

332
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,700
You know exactly how far
Umbrella will go.

333
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,500
So, what do we do now, huh?

334
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,800
I think we should be out of here
by sunrise.

335
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,400
What if there is no way out and he's
watching us on these cameras...

336
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,200
What if there is no way out and he's
watching us on these cameras...

337
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,500
...like this is some kind
of sick game?

338
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
- What is it?
- What's going on?

339
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,200
- Wait.
- Sunrise isn’t goanna wait.

340
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,800
No.

341
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,600
- There's something down there.
- Where?

342
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,600
There.

343
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,000
I don't see anything.

344
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,800
That doesn't alter the fact that
there is something down there.

345
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,500
I'm getting sick of this bullshit!

346
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,100
Peyton!

347
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,300
No!

348
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,000
He's located another two
S.T.A.R.S. Members.

349
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,700
Nemesis.

350
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,100
Run. Just go!

351
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,800
Primary target is identified.

352
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Gentlemen, this is what
we've been waiting for.

353
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,600
Confirm at 2: 18 and 27 seconds.

354
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,200
The Nemesis Program is now
fully activated.

355
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,000
Look, I'm...
I'm sorry about your friend.

356
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,400
Let's just get to the school
and find this kid.

357
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,700
This bite...

358
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,500
...it won't stop bleeding.

359
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,400
- Why didn't they see us?
- What?

360
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,600
The chopper. We were right there
in the street in front of the hospital.

361
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,400
- How could they not see us?
- They saw us.

362
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,000
What do you mean?

363
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,400
We're assets, Nicholai.

364
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,500
Expendable assets.

365
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,300
And we've just been expended.

366
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,200
Stop!

367
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,600
I'm not one of those things.

368
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,100
Hey, remember me? Look, I haven't
been bitten or anything. Look.

369
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,800
Climb aboard.

370
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,800
Lloyd Jefferson Wade.

371
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,200
You can call me L.J. On account
of the informal situation.

372
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,400
We're goanna have to split up
to search this place.

373
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,600
Forget it. Forget it! I'm not going
out there by myself.

374
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,700
I can go with you.

375
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,800
You, take the first floor.

376
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,400
You, take the second.

377
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,400
I'll take the basement.

378
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,800
- I've never shot a gun before.
- There's nothing to it.

379
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,600
Try to hit them in the head.

380
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,300
I see you, mother...

381
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,600
Oh, shit!

382
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,900
So did you get the call as well?

383
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,600
- What?
- You're here for the girl?

384
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,900
Oh, yeah, yeah. The girl.

385
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,400
Dr. Ashford didn't say he made a deal
with someone else.

386
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,100
I guess we're partners.

387
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,900
Shit.

388
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,600
Angela?

389
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,800
It's goanna be okay.

390
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,500
There's no need to be afraid.

391
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,100
We're goanna take you home.

392
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,700
Oh, my God.

393
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,500
Help me!

394
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,900
Terri?

395
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,000
You can't help her.

396
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,900
Not now.

397
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,600
I've seen what they do.

398
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,900
- Are you Angela?
- Yes.

399
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,600
We should hurry
before they come back.

400
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,200
Hold this.

401
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,500
Angela Ashford, huh?

402
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,400
That's a pretty grown-up name
for a little girl.

403
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,500
I'm not a little girl.

404
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,400
Besides...

405
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,300
...all my friends call me Angie.
- Angie, huh?

406
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,700
I like that.

407
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,900
Those things are in here.

408
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,900
It's okay, honey. They're slow.
We can run around them.

409
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,000
No.

410
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,100
Not them.

411
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,600
Them.

412
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,300
Get back.

413
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,800
Stay.

414
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,000
Thought you might need a hand.

415
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,800
- You work for Umbrella?
- Used to.

416
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:09,300
Until they left us for dead in this place.
Now I consider myself freelance.

417
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,200
Sergeant Nicholai Genovev,
at your service.

418
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,900
- Come on!
- Wait! Angie!

419
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,300
Save the girl! I've got this bitch.

420
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Oh, shit.

421
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,400
From now on, stay right beside me.

422
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,200
It's blocked.

423
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,300
What do we do now?

424
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,700
Wait here. Eyes:

425
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,700
Okay?

426
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,000
Thank you.

427
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,500
You two know each other?

428
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,500
She's infected.

429
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,000
She's infected on a massive level.

430
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,800
- How can you know that?
- Because she is too.

431
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,700
You're infected? When were
you goanna tell us that?

432
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,900
- Let me see.
- No.

433
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,200
You know I'm not goanna hurt you.

434
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,600
Let me see.

435
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,700
It's the antivirus,
the cure to the T-virus.

436
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,100
There's a cure?

437
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,700
How did you get this?

438
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,400
My daddy.
My daddy made it for me.

439
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,900
He's sick.
And someday, I'll get sick too.

440
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,800
He just wanted to stop that.

441
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,700
When I was little...

442
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,800
...I had to walk on crutches.

443
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,400
They said I'd never get better,
just worse.

444
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:59,600
He found a way
to make me stronger.

445
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,700
The T-virus.

446
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,500
Then they took the invention
away from him.

447
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,300
Get out of my house!

448
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,700
He's not a bad man.

449
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,400
He didn't mean for any of this.

450
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,700
It's okay.

451
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,000
Don't shoot! He's cool.

452
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,800
He made a deal with Dr. Doom,
same as you.

453
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,000
How many of you guys are there?

454
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:43,900
What do you mean?

455
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,400
Nicholai.

456
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,500
When were you bitten?

457
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,300
- Three hours ago.
- What the...?

458
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,400
It's your lucky day.

459
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,600
Should have told me you got bit.
I'm hanging with you and shit.

460
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,200
- Let me speak to my daughter.
- First, you tell us how we're getting out.

461
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,900
There's a helicopter
already being prepped.

462
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,800
It takes off in 47 minutes.

463
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,200
It'll be the last transport to leave
Raccoon City before they detonate.

464
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,100
I take it this helicopter isn't
laid out just for us.

465
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,500
No. It has another purpose,
but it'll be lightly guarded.

466
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:39,700
- Where's the evac site?
- May I speak to my daughter now?

467
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,500
- Daddy?
- Hey, sweetheart.

468
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,300
- Are you all right?
- When can I see you?

469
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,900
Soon. These people will
bring you to see me.

470
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,800
I'll see you very soon.

471
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,600
Put the lady back on.

472
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,000
Where do we have to go?

473
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,300
The helicopter will be at city hall.

474
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,600
I suggest you make haste.

475
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,100
Computers...

476
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,500
...so unreliable.

477
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,000
Just like people.

478
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,400
You really thought I didn't know?

479
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,500
So, what are you injecting me with?

480
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,400
The antivirus.

481
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,100
The T-virus reanimates dead cells.

482
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,300
Basically, bringing the dead to life.

483
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:00,700
Or in a living human,
it can cause uncontrollable mutation.

484
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:05,300
Or it can help her walk again,
if the virus is kept in check with this.

485
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,800
- Angie's infected?
- Yes.

486
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,800
The cellular growth is enough
to regenerate her...

487
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,100
...but not enough to cause mutation.

488
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,700
And they infected you
with the T-virus as well?

489
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,900
Yeah.

490
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,800
But don't worry.
I'm not contagious.

491
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,100
Here.

492
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,800
Tape the story.
I'll see that it gets put to good use.

493
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,600
My name is Alice.

494
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,700
I worked for the
Umbrella Corporation...

495
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:41,800
...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.

496
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:47,300
I was head of security at a secret
high-tech facility called The Hive...

497
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:51,300
...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental...

498
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,200
...viral weaponry.

499
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,800
Let's go.

500
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,400
You missed one.

501
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,900
We have to hurry.

502
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,100
- We're okay. We have time.
- No! We have to hurry.

503
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:11,500
- Holy shit! We stealing his ride!
- Take off.

504
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,800
- I said, take off!
- What's the rush?

505
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,500
We've been expecting you.

506
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,300
- Perimeter secure.
- All sectors locked down.

507
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:37,800
- Angie!
- Daddy!

508
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,600
- I knew you wouldn't leave me.
- No. Never.

509
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,800
Discard primary weaponry.

510
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:04,600
The two of you showed such promise,
but we had to see you in action.

511
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,400
And most impressive you've been.

512
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,400
You're like brother and sister.

513
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:13,900
Heightened speed, strength,
agility, the same killer instincts.

514
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,300
Parallel strands of research.

515
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,600
And now...
Now we'll discover which is superior.

516
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,200
Fight him.

517
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,900
No.

518
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,400
Fight him, or they die.

519
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,100
What makes you think I care?

520
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:42,400
Daddy! Daddy, no.

521
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,600
No.

522
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,800
He was a valuable asset
to the corporation.

523
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I don't even care
about these people.

524
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,200
Begin.

525
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,600
He's mutating. I want him
in the Nemesis Program.

526
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,900
Matt!

527
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,600
Cellular structure breaking down.

528
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:58,600
T-virus is manifesting itself
in a genetic mutation.

529
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,200
We're seeing similar
cellular regeneration.

530
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,200
I'm sorry.

531
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,100
Oh, Matt. I'm so sorry.

532
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,400
Finish him.

533
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,900
I said, finish him.

534
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,700
No.

535
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,600
No.

536
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,200
Don't you understand
how important you are to me?

537
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,600
That creature is one thing,
but you...

538
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:38,300
...somehow you bonded
with the T-virus on a cellular level.

539
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:43,100
You adapted it, changed it.
You became magnificent.

540
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,700
- I became a freak.
- No.

541
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:49,600
You're not mutation.
You're evolution.

542
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,900
With my help, just imagine
what you can achieve.

543
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,400
What about him?

544
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:02,800
Evolution has its dead ends.

545
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:06,300
Now, finish this.
Put him out of his misery...

546
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,600
...and come with me.

547
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,200
No.

548
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,900
You're such
a disappointment to me.

549
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,700
All that strength...

550
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,200
...but no will to use it.

551
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,400
What a waste.

552
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,800
Prepare for takeoff.

553
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,200
Sanitation of Raccoon City
to commence on my mark.

554
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,200
Kill her.

555
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,400
What are you doing?

556
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,400
Get us airborne.

557
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,500
This is Cain. Priority overload.
Initiate launch proceedings.

558
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:37,400
Detonation set
at T-minus 5 minutes.

559
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,400
Angie, get down!

560
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,500
Why haven't we taken off?

561
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,500
Because I usually drive a Cadillac.

562
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,500
Surrender, or we open fire.

563
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,900
Drop it.

564
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,400
Alice!

565
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,500
Drop your weapon and surrender.

566
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,300
Let's get this thing in the air!

567
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,300
You have to get up.

568
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,800
Matt...

569
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,300
Come on, we have to go.
We have to go. Come on.

570
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:16,100
Come on.

571
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,400
Get up!

572
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,200
If you expect me to beg, I will not.

573
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,600
Wait.

574
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,800
Killing me won't put things right.

575
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:48,700
No...

576
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,700
...but it's a start.

577
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:04,200
Are you going to be all right?

578
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,900
Hang on to something!

579
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,400
We're going down!

580
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,900
U-Gamma 9 to base.
Confirmation.

581
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:41,800
We've located the crash site.

582
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,500
Fetch the medical team.

583
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,300
What about the others?

584
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,000
No other bodies found, sir.

585
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,000
We have unconfirmed reports
of disaster at Raccoon City.

586
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,000
These shocking images just in.

587
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:24,300
A mysterious plague
or viral outbreak has run rampant...

588
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,800
Implicating Umbrella Corporation
in deaths of innocent citizens.

589
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,400
This tape, work of former Raccoon 7
anchorwoman Terri Morales.

590
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,000
New evidence now
discredits earlier reports...

591
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,700
- Nothing more than sick joke.
- Fake videotape totally discredited.

592
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,400
Nothing more than a big hoax.

593
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,400
Playing on the very real tragedy...

594
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,000
...which overwhelmed
Raccoon City this week.

595
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,300
The reactor at the nuclear
power station went critical.

596
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:53,100
The worst atomic disaster since the
Russian Chernobyl incident in 1986.

597
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:56,700
The state governor personally
thanked the Umbrella Corporation...

598
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,200
...for their swift action.

599
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:02,100
The perpetrators of the hoax,
Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera...

600
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:05,200
...now being sought
for questioning by the police.

601
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,900
Alice.

602
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Alice, wake up.

603
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,800
Can you hear me?

604
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:43,300
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

605
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:47,300
Good.

606
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,600
Begin the purging process.

607
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,100
Her recovery's remarkable.

608
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,700
And her powers,
both physical and mental...

609
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:28,900
...are developing
at a geometric rate.

610
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,600
Where are you?

611
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,300
You're safe.

612
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,300
Come on.

613
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,700
That's it.

614
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,800
There we are.

615
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,600
Do you know what that is?

616
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,100
It's a pen.

617
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,700
You see?

618
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,600
You try.

619
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,700
That's it.

620
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,300
Pen.

621
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,800
Look at me.

622
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,400
Can you remember anything?

623
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:40,700
You remember your name?

624
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,500
My name?

625
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:45,200
My name.

626
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,500
I want her under
24-hour observation.

627
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,500
A complete set of blood work.

628
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,100
Chemical and electrolyte analysis
by the end of the day.

629
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,700
My name.

630
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:03,500
- My name.
- Sir.

631
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:05,700
Advanced reflex testing is a priority.

632
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:06,900
My name.

633
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,900
- Monitor electrical impulses...
- Sir.

634
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,500
Sir!

635
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,100
What is it?

636
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,300
My name...

637
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,400
...is Alice.

638
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:31,900
And I remember everything.

639
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:05,100
This is central.
Request immediate backup.

640
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:07,300
Maximum response.

641
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:49,500
Thank you, gentlemen.
We'll take over from here.

642
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:54,000
- On whose authority?
- Classified. Level six authorization.

643
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,000
Sorry, sir.

644
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:57,000
Let them go.

645
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:02,800
Good to have you back.

646
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:06,000
Are you all right?

647
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,600
Program Alice activated.

648
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,800
What did they do to you?

649
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,400
This is a product of the
Umbrella Corporation.

650
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,100
Our business is life itself.

651
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:45,100
Some side effects may occur.
