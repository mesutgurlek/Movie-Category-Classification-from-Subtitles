477
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,978
<i>The inscription reads,</i>

'Here tells a
tale of passion,

479

loyalty, deceit,
betrayal, and revenge.'

480
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:13,190
Sounds good to me.
You read to us.

481
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:18,929
Okay. Here we go.

<i>bear the eight</i>
<i>pointed cross,</i>

496

<i>a symbol of purity</i>

497

(Gregoire)
What do you
have for me?

508
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,503
- An apple, my lord.
- Thank you.

509
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,138
- Thank you, my lord.
- I'll enjoy this.

510

You stand
in my way, sergeant.
What is your name?

511
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:48,185
Melkon.

512
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:49,453
Melkon.

513
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:52,089
You find
humor in this?

514
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:56,493
Well, t'is a little
foreign to my ear.

515
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:58,595
Did I miss something
of importance here?

516
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,230
<i>We fought</i>

Lord Gregoire, yes,
I've heard of him.

519
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:09,172
He's one of the greatest

Really?
Catch.

521

Mm. Delicious.

522
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:21,251
So this is where
you've been all
day, huh?

523
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:22,419
Picking apples.

524
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:25,622
Hm. What can I say?

525
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,691
I love the orchard.

It is now.

530
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,274
Messy business, huh,
this apple picking.

531
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:48,145
It is. How are
you, my brother?

532
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:51,114
I'm ready to go
to battle again on
your command, my lord.

533
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:53,717
I'm not your lord,

<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

(stunted speech)
We won,
Gregoire, we won!

537
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:02,659
Yes, again we
were victorious.

538
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:07,430
When will I be
ready to fight,
my lord?

539
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,132
We've spoken
of this, Koko.

540
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,735
Every day!

541
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:13,703
Then when?

542
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:15,739
It is not your time,
little one.

543
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:18,241
It is not
your place.

544
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:20,110
You always say--

545
00:36:20,112 --> 00:36:23,280
Koko, is there not
somewhere of more importance

546
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:25,148
where you should be?

547
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,384
Yes, my lord.

548
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,119
Then get there.

549
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:33,089
<i>Aha, yes, my lord.</i>
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:36,693
But when you need
me, I am ready.

[laughing]

552
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:44,134
Get that from him.

553
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:45,535
He is waiting
for the day

554
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,870
you allow him to
shield and fight.

555
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,372
And he'd be
lost in an instant.

<i>not in sword,</i>

his heart.
Sergeant?

Nearly a third, my lord.

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,734
Prisoners?

565
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,502
Prisoners?!

566
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,738
None, they would
not surrender,
my lord.

Ah. Such valor.

568
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:30,180
If only their
beliefs were proper.

569
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:32,882
Ah then,
scour the acre.

570
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:34,851

Then you need
only scour
once more.

Yes, my lord.

Hello, children.

I heard we had
some visitors
in town,

579
00:37:57,743 --> 00:37:59,809

the opportunity--

00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:13,523
Is there something
we can help you
with, Father?

583
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:15,692
<i>Because if this is</i>

we happen to be short
on money at the moment.

585

This is not
about money.

586
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:22,699
It's just that I
wanted to welcome
you to town

well, I'm
from here, and
so is she, and, um--

00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,946
we've never
seen you before.

591

Well, that's why

But now we
know each other,

Well, who do
we have here?

I'm really glad

So, any good?

612

Oh, that? No, just
a hobby I picked up.

613
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,740
Mostly for cardio.

You know, trying to keep
the old midsection flat.

Tennis, swimming.

But, uh-- that
one stuck.
Go figure.

So, what can
I do for you?

620
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,898
Oh, right. I'm at
the Rhein estate

621
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,636
I'm here to pick up an order

Couple? They
know each other?

01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,408
You seem pensive.

957
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:36,011
What are your
thoughts, Melkon?

958
01:03:36,013 --> 01:03:37,813
Of no import, my lord.

959
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:40,282
We have no boundaries.
You may speak to me.

960
01:03:40,284 --> 01:03:42,150
That is it.
Ha.

961
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:45,287
That is just it.
With you, there
is no jealousy,

962
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:48,089
no avarice,
no scorn.

963
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:50,192
But with my
own blood brother--

964
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:52,828
Melkon.

965
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:56,231
Ill will betwixt
brothers has ever
been common.

966
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:58,233
Look at Romulus
and Remus,

967
01:03:58,235 --> 01:03:59,835
Cain and Abel--

968
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:00,802
My brother is no Cain!

969
01:04:00,804 --> 01:04:02,003
[snorting]

970
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,905
<i>Forgive me, please.</i>

971
01:04:03,907 --> 01:04:05,941
I should not have
raised my voice at you.

972
01:04:05,943 --> 01:04:08,443
It is understandable.

973
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:11,279
Your brother's contempt
occupies your thoughts.

974
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:13,181
My worries may
be for naught.

975
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:15,116
Let us hope.

976
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:17,118
[patting]

977
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,888
But there is
one thing more.

978
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,356
Speak your heart.

979
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,393
T'is nothing--really.

980
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:27,963
Malcolm, speak to me.

981
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:31,466
It is just a thought
that troubles me betimes.

982
01:04:31,468 --> 01:04:33,401
And that is?

983
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:36,872
Trading my sword
for a simple,
more peaceful life.

984
01:04:36,874 --> 01:04:40,275
Ah. Yes.
But only betimes.

985
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:43,245
Pray, misunderstand
me not, my lord.

986
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:45,881
Being the best does
too have its advantages.

987
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:49,017
Hm, yes.
Worship--

988
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:52,053
praise, adoration.

989
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:55,123
- No.
- No?

990
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:58,093
Then of what advantage
do you speak, brother?

991
01:04:58,095 --> 01:05:00,562
It allows me to be
in your presence,
my lord.

992
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:05,433
[soft snorting]

993
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:11,506
[patting]
Let us ride.

994
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:12,574
Thank you, my lord.

995
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:15,543

[horse neighs]

999
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,473
My lord,
they are here.

1000
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:54,950
Arm yourselves.
Be not obvious.

1001
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:57,585
On my signal.

1002
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,355
[mutters to himself]
My time is now.

1003
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:03,224
(Gregoire)
Easy, Claudius, easy.

1004
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:04,559
[horse snorts softly]

1005
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:06,061
Whoa.

1006
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:18,340
I have counted the gold,

1007
01:06:18,342 --> 01:06:21,109
and it is quite a sum.

1008
01:06:21,111 --> 01:06:22,510
You have done
well, Gregoire.

1009
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:24,212
<i>We</i> have done well.

1010
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:26,915
The Grandmaster
will be very pleased.

1011
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:29,484
Though wrested from
the hands of evil,

1012
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:33,621
this unforeseen treasure
will serve great purpose.

1013
01:06:33,623 --> 01:06:35,523
Many hungry will
be fed tonight.

1014
01:06:35,525 --> 01:06:37,392
Many poor will
be clothed.

1015
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:39,527
The villages, restored.

1016
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:41,529
All in the name
of the cause.

1017
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:45,400
You speak naught
but the truth, brothers.

1018
01:06:45,402 --> 01:06:47,035
Has anyone
seen Koko?

1019
01:06:47,037 --> 01:06:48,937
Ah, he is fetching
water for travel.

1020
01:06:48,939 --> 01:06:50,538
Hm.

1021
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:53,208
Might I have a word
with you, Gregoire?

1022
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,943
Of course.

1023
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,919
<i>(male voice)</i>
<i>Brother--</i>

1024

Gregoire?

1027
01:07:13,463 --> 01:07:16,297
Come, let us
talk, brother.

1028
01:07:16,299 --> 01:07:19,434
When thrusting in
with the dagger,
and then over--

1029
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:21,569
We turn to
our weapons, milord.

1030
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:24,072
Will you have us
put a sharp edge
to your dagger and sword?

1031
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:26,474
Indeed.
I thank you.

1032
01:07:26,476 --> 01:07:27,976
<i>And yours, my lord?</i>

1033

[snorting]

1034
01:07:34,117 --> 01:07:36,184
Be careful
with it, please.

1035
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:39,254
Ah, such magnificence.

1036
01:07:39,256 --> 01:07:43,358
<i>I shall give it</i>
<i>a fine edge, my lord.</i>

1037
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,226
<i>But gingerly, sergeant,</i>

1038
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:49,631
I need enough steel
to last yet 100
battles more.

1039
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:53,168
Yes, 100 battles more.

1040
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:55,603
<i>Truly you and I have</i>
<i>given our lives</i>

1041
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:58,406
- to the service
of the true cross.
- Oh?

1042
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,408
And yet, strange,
is it not,

1043
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:05,213
we have been
granted not for our
years of loyal service.

1044
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:09,150
No tribute for a life
of poverty, chastity
and obedience.

1045
01:08:09,152 --> 01:08:10,652
No reward.

1046
01:08:10,654 --> 01:08:13,721
<i>Oh, Renault.</i>
<i>Old friend.</i>

1047
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:17,492
You are tired, and
you are weary
from battle.

1048
01:08:17,494 --> 01:08:19,227
You mean not
what you say.

1049
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:20,528
<i>But there are</i>
<i>the others.</i>

1050
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,297
Knights that are
paid to fight

1051
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:24,299
and they are allowed
to keep their winnings.

1052
01:08:24,301 --> 01:08:29,104
Mercenaries? Those who
covet glory and riches?

1053
01:08:29,106 --> 01:08:31,372
We are not
warmongers, Renault.

1054
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:33,741
We are of a
different breed.

1055
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:38,713
Aye, and t'is our unity
that gives us strength,
is it not?

1056
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:42,517
By God's divine grace,
we are a glorious force.

1057
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:44,219
Skilled at
confronting the enemy,

1058
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:46,654
luring him in,
catching him unawares.

1059
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:48,523
Victorious time
and time again!

1060
01:08:48,525 --> 01:08:50,158
Aye, victorious.

1061
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,060
And to the victors
goes the spoils.

1062
01:08:52,062 --> 01:08:55,096
Such is the way of
conquering nations,
is it not?

1063
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:57,532
Conquering nation?

1064
01:08:57,534 --> 01:09:00,268
I did not
know we'd become
a conquering nation.

1065
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:04,606
I was under the belief
that we're still yet
an order. Hm?

1066
01:09:04,608 --> 01:09:07,876
And I say to you it
is time we cease
to worry

1067
01:09:07,878 --> 01:09:11,546
<i>about the welfare</i>
<i>of the poor and</i>
<i>the weak!</i>

Let their fate
be in the hands
of God.

1069
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:18,520
How has your heart
become so blackened?

<i>I see it in your eye.</i>

You've lost your way.

1072
01:09:23,093 --> 01:09:25,627
Nay, Brother.
I have found it.

1073
01:09:25,629 --> 01:09:29,430
And I will attain it
with the treasure in
yond wagon.

1074
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:32,267
Let us seize this
opportunity together, Gregoire.

<i>none of it if not</i>
<i>for you.</i>

1076
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:39,174
Think of the comforts
such a treasure
would buy.

1077
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:43,745
The pleasures that
we might finally
delight in.

1078
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:45,547
What say you, brother?

1079
01:09:45,549 --> 01:09:48,383
I would rather be eaten
by a pack of wolves

1080
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:51,586
than allow your evil venom
to course through my veins.

1081
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:55,790
You are
an honorable man.

1082
01:09:55,792 --> 01:09:56,758

Brother, how will
you sleep tonight?

01:34:46,682 --> 01:34:49,282
But tell me,
my lord,

1432
01:34:49,284 --> 01:34:50,984
how can you be such
a great leader

1433
01:34:50,986 --> 01:34:54,888
when you're so dramatic?

1434
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:57,657
That is what makes me
such a great leader.

1435
01:34:57,659 --> 01:34:59,125
And chicks dig it.

1436
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:04,964
Touche.

1437
01:35:04,966 --> 01:35:07,000
Wait. You're
not shot?

1438
01:35:07,002 --> 01:35:09,636
No, he missed
me by a mile.

1439
01:35:09,638 --> 01:35:13,139
And hey, nice
save by the way.

1440
01:35:13,141 --> 01:35:15,108
<i>Aren't you</i>
<i>guys forgetting</i>
<i>about something?</i>

1441
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:18,078
The six hacked up
mutilated bodies?

1442
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,346
Six?

1443
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:22,115
Only a couple
are mine.

1444
01:35:22,117 --> 01:35:25,685
Four. Four
were yours.

1445
01:35:25,687 --> 01:35:26,853
Four.

1446
01:35:26,855 --> 01:35:30,724
I'm impressed.

1447
01:35:30,726 --> 01:35:33,359
I say we pin
it on the priest.

1448
01:35:33,594 --> 01:35:38,665
Nice. See, I told you.
You're a leader of men.

1449
01:35:38,667 --> 01:35:40,200
Don't even think
that I'm not
really pissed

1450
01:35:40,202 --> 01:35:41,768
at you at you right now.
I just can't have

1451
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:43,670
my new boyfriend
go to jail

1452
01:35:43,672 --> 01:35:45,138
on the first night
we start dating.

1453
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:46,906
- Boyfriend?
- Yes.

1454
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:49,375
- Dating?
- Yes.

1455
01:35:49,377 --> 01:35:51,778
What are you, nuts?
You're like Koko
and stuff.

1456
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:53,379
Come on!
We're soul mates.

1457
01:35:53,381 --> 01:35:56,316
Ow! My nipple, ow!
My nipple!

1458
01:35:56,318 --> 01:36:00,787
You're nuts.
I like it.

1459
01:36:00,789 --> 01:36:03,857
