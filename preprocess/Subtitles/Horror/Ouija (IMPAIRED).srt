First, the rules.

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,019
You can never, ever play alone.

4
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:47,847
You can never play in a graveyard.
And you always have to say goodbye.

5
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:52,429
To start, you circle the board
once for each player.

6
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:56,696
Then we say, "As friends we gather,
hearts are true."

"Signal's real bad.
I only got, like, one bar in here."

lived in your old house.

634
01:01:27,316 --> 01:01:29,318
She's not alive anymore.

635
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,461
And this is gonna sound
really strange but...

636
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,762
but I think I know why.

637
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:41,169
I believe there's a
presence in that house.

638
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:45,546
I wouldn't be surprised
if there's more than one.

639
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,881
I found pictures of you and your sister.

640
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,044
You found pictures?
You found my family photos?

641
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,813
Yeah. I can bring them to you,
or send them, if you like.

642
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,715
Please bring them.

643
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:03,586
I haven't seen my sister's face
in a very long time.

644
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:07,097
At least not her real face.

645
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:15,934
I believe I saw her.
Me and my friends. And her lips,

646
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,709
they were stitched shut.

647
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:22,910
Mother did that to her.

648
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:36,095
My mother practiced mediumship.

649
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,287
And if practice makes perfect,
let me tell you,

650
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:41,524
she was pretty damn good,
depending on your point of view.

651
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:46,131
She conducted séances,
she used spirit boards. Anything.

652
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,933
A bit reckless, actually.
Doris loved my mother.

653
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:54,278
She wanted to help.
She was fascinated by it all.

654
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:59,342
And when the séances got bigger
and my mother really made connections,

655
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,979
she needed a vessel.
A vessel to give them a voice.

656
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:05,923
- Who?
- The spirits.

657
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:09,086
She used Doris.

658
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,396
And then something
went wrong with Mother.

659
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:17,393
Chasing the dead and living in all
those shadows, something snapped.

660
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:20,335
She couldn't turn it off.
She couldn't break the connection.

661
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:23,938
Mother was consumed by them.

662
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,942
She was insane.

663
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:30,040
So, she did that to Doris.

664
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:34,988
To her lips. To stop them from talking.

665
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,324
And then Doris went missing?

666
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,922
Missing.

667
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,431
She never left the house, did she?

668
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:48,359
No. No, she didn't.

669
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:53,399
Mother wasn't herself. She killed Doris.

670
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:58,301
And after that, I did what I
needed to do to stop Mother.

No, you opened up a channel.

681
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,809
You made a connection. With what?

682
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,107
- A spirit board, I bet.
- Yeah.

and now she's awake again.

Both of them. Mother, too.

685

And if you could see them...

it's the body and the board.

689

and it is hard to stop.

691

Mother used to have a secret room.

01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:12,017
She sealed it up, after Doris,
down in the basement.

Laine, what do we do?

796
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,193
Laine!

797
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,722
Go get the board.

As friends we've gathered,
hearts are true.

810
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:22,001
Spirits near, we call to you.

811
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:25,600
Doris, I'm playing alone!
You have to play!

Hey.

824
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:51,213
- Feeling any better?
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

825
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:53,949
I just miss them.

826
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:55,853
All the time.

827
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:57,921
Yeah, me too.

828
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,389
I guess you never really feel like
you get to say goodbye

829
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:04,060
and maybe that's okay.

830
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,565
Oh, well... Maybe there are no goodbyes.

831
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:11,199
Not really.

832
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:19,245
I keep wondering about that night.

833
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:23,485
That poor little girl.

834
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:29,424
All of those dark spirits
that were in her.

835

Where do you think they went?
