1
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,217
(cigarette lighter clicks)

2
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,196
(engine starts)

3
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,198
(distant siren squawks)

4
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,812
(dispatch radio buzzes)

5
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,909
(siren wails)

6
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:07,815
Detective Westcott,
Eddie Argo.

7
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,089
Eddie, be nice.

8
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,098
(policeman shouts indistinctly)

9
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,194
How's it goin'?

10
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,141
Have you eaten yet?

11
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,143
No. Couldn't eat.

12
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,439
Jack!

13
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:27,810
JACK: Ed, how you doin'?

14
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,870
What you got?

15
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,350
JACK: Couple of kids found her.

16
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,383
(sighing) Burning, looks like.

17
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,514
JACK: Maybe she was electrocuted.

18
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,219
She's Sharon Williams,
Wesley Smith's girlfriend.

19
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,283
ED: Wes?

20
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:46,722
Well, maybe she's better off dead.

21
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,172
Who's Wesley Smith?

22
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,037
Pimp, gangster,
all-around piece of shit.

23
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,477
Wanna take a shot?

24
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,372
- (scoffs)
- Go ahead.

25
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,621
Phew... premeditated.

26
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,248
Obviously.

27
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:19,292
Uh, it was maybe sexual.

28
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,365
Dumping her could Just be panic.

29
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,464
Though why here
and not in the river?

30
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,439
Why not Just, uh,

31
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,739
chop her up in pieces
and stuff her in the Dumpster?

32
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,662
Looks like "was."

33
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,924
Or "Wes."

34
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:55,627
JACK: Either way,
somebody don't like Wesley.

35
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,602
Maybe they Just don't like her.

36
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,001
(chuckles) Yeah.

37
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,973
You know, if you carve something
into the belly of a dead woman...

38
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,407
it ain't her you want to read it.

39
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,550
fucking gangbangers.

40
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,664
What if the child wasn't Wesley's?

41
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,222
Maybe he got Jealous.

42
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,025
Let's see if he's grieving.

43
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,337
There's Pierre Jackson's crew.

44
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,775
Driver's Danny Leone.

45
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,142
(Danny calls out indistinctly)

46
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,410
ED: That's Pierre,
local asshole number one.

47
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,417
JAMAL: Yo, yo, yo.
Pierre, what up, man?

48
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,146
ED: That's Hassan's gang,

49
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,347
the only competition
he's got left here.

50
00:05:56,422 --> 00:06:01,257
There's Jamal Osman,
another of Pierre's assholes.

51
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,488
Can't see Wesley, though.

52
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,599
So a rival gang's
high on your list of suspects?

53
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:08,656
No.

54
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,903
These bastards
ain't the electrocuting kind.

55
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,840
They're more like,
"fucking hate you." Bang.

56
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,240
Well.

57
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,912
Bad guys.

58
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,521
Go question.

59
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,641
(gang members arguing)

60
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,957
Hey.

61
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,796
(all fall silent)

62
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,563
We're looking for Wesley Smith.

63
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,070
(laughs)

64
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,100
Well, he sure as hell
ain't lookin' for you.

65
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,803
You new, baby?

66
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,869
- (gang member laughs)
- You look kind of fuckable for a cop.

67
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,972
Want some thug dick, woman?

68
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,074
- She wants it bad.
- Snow White's got it bad.

69
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,210
- You've seen Wesley?
- What you down on Wes for?

70
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,982
Yeah, what the fuck you want, bitch?

71
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,819
His girlfriend
was murdered last night.

72
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,420
- Electrocuted.
- fuck that.

73
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,985
What the fuck you talking about?

74
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,394
WESTCOTT:
Have you seen him, hmm?

75
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,796
What you think, Wes did it?

76
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,393
Why the fuck is he gonna off his girl
when she having his baby and shit?

77
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,961
You looking for a suspect,
maybe you need to take a look

78
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,336
at fucking Hassan over here.

79
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,136
Why the fuck would I waste my time

80
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,735
fizzin' a chickenhead skank
like that ho, huh?

81
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,904
What the fuck!

82
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,504
(shouting, cocking weapons)

83
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,215
ED: Put it away.

84
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,380
MAN: Yo, Argo!

85
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:28,064
Snuffing a pregnant girl
would be right up your alley, Pierre.

86
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,640
Two helpless victims in one.

87
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,710
Night full of kicks.

88
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,586
Throw her in the bath...

89
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,849
maybe toss a heater in after her.

90
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,087
Come on, man, we were rolling
with her Just last night.

91
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,686
Uh-huh. What?

92
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:56,166
Selling shit to kids down
at your place in Denver Street?

93
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,863
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- PIERRE: Shut the fuck up, Jamal.

94
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,239
Also in Stenman Street, huh?

95
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,314
Thanks.

96
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,024
Yeah, come on, man.

97
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,062
- We're all going, yo.
- Yo, Pierre.

98
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,563
- Shut the fuck up.
- You into that?

99
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,757
fucking come on, man.

100
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,027
I'll bet you are.
You like a little black, huh?

101
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,732
Hey, don't you wanna
chomp down on this for me?

102
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,069
Hey, yo, bitch!

103
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,665
You should go for it.

104
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,472
You know, pillow talk.
Could be useful.

105
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,479
I was warned you're an asshole.

106
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,276
Think you did great.

107
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,679
Apart from nearly getting us killed.

108
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,847
GANGSTER:
Let's get the fuck outta here.

109
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,062
(distant dogs barking)

110
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,229
(woman screaming)

111
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,500
(man shouting)

112
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:10,041
(woman speaks foreign language)

113
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:25,013
(glass clinks)

114
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,430
Want a blow Job?

115
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,728
I suck dick good for 10 bucks.

116
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,273
Elly, it's me.

117
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,234
Wesley around?

118
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:50,841
He went up there.

119
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,482
It might have been yesterday.

120
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:56,714
(laughs softly)

121
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,655
(Dominic whimpers)

122
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,195
Shh.

123
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,392
ED: Hi, Dominic.

124
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,093
ELLY: It's okay, baby.

125
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,032
(clattering)

126
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,901
Ah, fuck.

127
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,421
(inhales sharply)

128
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,867
JACK: To Wesley Smith,

129
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,811
a fucking asshole
who will not be missed.

130
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,246
MEN: Yeah!

131
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,784
(laughter and cheers)

132
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,283
CHIEF MacLEAN: Okay, cute.

133
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,723
Back to work.

134
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,463
I hope all that blood
don't give you nightmares.

135
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,435
I was even thinking
someone ought to,

136
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,496
you know,
take care of you tonight.

137
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,404
I'd rather be electrocuted.

138
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,499
No offense.

139
00:12:58,577 --> 00:12:59,976
Oh, shit.

140
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,220
MAN: Yeah, we'll send someone round.

141
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,863
So you really think
he deserved to die?

142
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,200
Sure.

143
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,005
I wish I'd done it myself.

144
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,695
PATHOLOGIST: Nice party.

145
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,758
(Ed grunts)

146
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,703
Postmortem incision.

147
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,470
Electrocution around the head.

148
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,033
WESTCOTT: Like an execution.

149
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,170
PATHOLOGIST: Internal organs,
brain, etcetera,

150
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,216
all cooked, of course,
at about 8:00 p.m. last night.

151
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,209
Now, they both have traces

152
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:17,380
of an extremely strong,
fast-acting sedative,

153
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,425
one that's normally used
to tranquilize animals.

154
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,256
Out in less than half a minute,
awake again in an hour.

155
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,854
ED: So that links them
to the same guy.

156
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,331
She was electrocuted...

157
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,696
and Wes here was tortured.

158
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:39,073
You think they were together
when she was electrocuted?

159
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,636
Did he hang himself
or was it made to look that way?

160
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,909
PATHOLOGIST:
Looks like suicide.

161
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,282
ED: What's this,
this burn on his fingers?

162
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,821
PATHOLOGIST:
Only thing that doesn't fit.

163
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,084
It's the only burn on him.

164
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,122
Could it be electrical,
like from a switch?

165
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,795
PATHOLOGIST: Could be.

166
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,203
You think he electrocuted
his pregnant girlfriend?

167
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,196
I don't know.

168
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:11,769
Maybe he didn't...

169
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,743
but he sure as hell
didn't slash the shit out of himself.

170
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,814
(elevated train rattling)

171
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,151
WESTCOTT: Is your apartment
this much of a mess?

172
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,386
ED: Much worse.

173
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,889
Needs a woman's touch.

174
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,625
WESTCOTT: (scoffs)
Yeah. In your dreams.

175
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,363
ED: How 'bout you?

176
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,359
Live alone?

177
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,634
You got a boyfriend
to keep you warm?

178
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,007
Alone.

179
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,476
Ouch.

180
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,182
And you'll never forgive him, right?

181
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,583
Whatever.

182
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,148
Just here.

183
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,492
ED: You must be in some racket
to be able to afford this.

184
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,358
Turning tricks?

185
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,460
See you tomorrow.

186
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,968
See you.

187
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,972
(door buzzes)

188
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,572
(child crying in distance)

189
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,442
(knocks)

190
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,317
You got five bucks?

191
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,257
What I look like, a millionaire?

192
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,162
(sighs)

193
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,519
ED: Did Wes have any new enemies
you haven't told me about?

194
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,185
Pierre and Jamal
still think it was Hassan's crew.

195
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,592
This was no stupid ghetto drive-by.

196
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,223
This was psychological, sadistic.

197
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,894
That's always your problem, Eddie.

198
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,368
You underestimate people, man.

199
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,201
I mean, shit, if Pierre knew
I was rolling with you,

200
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,900
you'd see some fucking sadism.

201
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,946
Did I tell you
even his dick got sliced?

202
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,946
Is this real grief...

203
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,028
or you Just scared the guy sliced Wes
won't like you too much either?

204
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,061
He got what was
coming to him, Danny.

205
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,742
(doorknob Jiggles)

206
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,511
Crazy-ass bitch from next door.

207
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,384
Always wanting back
for something, man.

208
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,553
(scratching at doorlock)

209
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,426
(door rattling)

210
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,135
Who there?

211
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,035
(rattling door)

212
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,551
- (gagging)
- What the fuck?

213
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:52,817
Yo, Jamal!

214
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,051
Come on, man!

215
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,287
Hey, yo, shit!
Come on, Jamal.

216
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,091
Shit, come on, Jamal.

217
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,655
Jamal, come on, man.
Stay with me, bro.

218
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,325
Come on, man. Don't you...

219
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,402
Jamal, come on, man.

220
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,303
Come on. fuck.

221
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,966
Come on, wake up, man.

222
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,341
Yo, Jamal, come on, please.

223
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,811
Please! Shit.

224
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,643
f-fuck.

225
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,649
Yo, get a fucking ambulance, man.

226
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,208
DANNY: Get an ambulance.

227
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,615
(Jamal stops gasping)

228
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,234
(elevated train rumbles)

229
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,630
(siren wails)

230
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,733
(dispatch radio buzzes)

231
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,549
- So you called the ambulance.
- (cigarette lighter clicks)

232
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,724
JACK: Danny, you got something?

233
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,393
(indistinct police radio chatter)

234
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,298
DANNY: This is all I got.

235
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,602
That's good.
See? It wasn't so hard.

236
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,164
Next time I ask you for something...

237
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,714
MAN: Over here, sir.

238
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,390
(flies buzzing)

239
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,773
Is that the fucking brother?

240
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,985
(elevated train rumbles;
air brakes squealing)

241
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,836
JACK: We got two vics in each case,
Wesley Smith and Jamal Osman,

242
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,404
both tortured half to death.

243
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,916
Wes hangs himself;
Jamal dies later.

244
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:37,318
Then Wes's girl and Jamal's twin brother,
both of them electrocuted,

245
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,381
and the twin brother tagged
with more of this gang shit.

246
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,429
ED: Both Wes and Jamal
had a burned index finger.

247
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,421
What if they were forced?

248
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,968
What if they were tortured
till they had to flick the switch?

249
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,696
And the switch burned them.

250
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,568
It's some kind of punishment.

251
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:04,172
JACK: It's working itself up
into a nice little fucking gang war.

252
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,149
- Goddamn scum.
- WESTCOTT: This is algebra.

253
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,551
Look, an equals sign.
<i>"W</i> delta <i>Z equals."

254
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,816
JACK: Thank you very much,
Professor Westcott.

255
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,256
Now maybe you could tell me
what it fucking means.

256
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,850
WESTCOTT:
It means it's not the gangs,

257
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:18,589
unless they're attending
fucking night school.

258
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:19,721
What?

259
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,390
Great. Thank you.

260
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,991
Hey, Eddie.

261
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,702
The animal tranq's
marketed as Alstyxamine,

262
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,105
and only one place
buys it in the whole state.

263
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,335
Got the address.

264
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,223
(animals chirping)

265
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,958
(reptile chitters; snake rattles)

266
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,700
Dr. Gelb?

267
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,501
Dr. Gelb.

268
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,175
The animals are licensed.

269
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:13,183
All the certificates are up to date.

270
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,583
WESTCOTT: This lab is
the only place within 100 miles

271
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,713
to keep stocks of Alstyxamine.

272
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,121
Would you tell us
what you use it for?

273
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,717
It's all legal,
Just the way you guys like it.

274
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,592
Listen, if you want me
to take you in for being an asshole,

275
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,291
I got a license to do that.

276
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,390
What animals would you use it on?

277
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,232
I used to keep
a couple of crocs. That's all.

278
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:37,675
Are you aware of any Alstyxamine
going missing in the last three months?

279
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:38,800
No.

280
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,141
Who else has access
to your stocks of tranquilizer?

281
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,202
Nobody.

282
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,043
Any lab assistants?

283
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,446
Money's tight.

284
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,350
What kind of science do you do?

285
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,081
Pathology, animal behav...

286
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,715
I'm gonna need this opened, please.

287
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,883
Uh, yeah. Sure.

288
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:01,955
There you go.

289
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,063
This is quite a collection
of drugs you got here.

290
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,038
Gonna need to see your records.

291
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,768
ED: What do you do exactly?

292
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,175
Graft elephant ears on monkeys?

293
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,271
My work concerns
how species respond to predators,

294
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,873
how they warn each other,
if they warn each other...

295
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:23,910
how far they go to protect each other,
if they protect each other.

296
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,457
Like, you throw a croc
into a cage of monkeys

297
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,152
and see how they deal with it?

298
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,456
Not always with a real crocodile.

299
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,996
You see, monkeys are expensive.

300
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:42,896
Eddie?

301
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,911
fuck.

302
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,044
(tranquilizer dart gun fires)

303
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,554
Shit, Eddie!

304
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:03,950
(groans)

305
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:06,452
Eddie!

306
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,289
Shit.

307
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,065
fuck.

308
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,442
(monkeys screeching)

309
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,350
(hissing)

310
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,390
Unh-unh!

311
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,874
(metal rod clatters)

312
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,144

(engine starts)

317
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:54,794
Don't move!

00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:05,748
(Gelb yelps)

319
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,881
Don't fight.

320
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,582
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

321
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:13,988
Shut your fucking mouth.

322
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,764
Hmph!

323
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,365
Explain it to me.

324
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,335
<i>W delta Z.</i> what does it mean?

325
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,246
The Price equation.

326
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:40,876
The... <i>W's</i> fitness,

327
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,819
the ability to reproduce
across generations.

328
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:47,588
<i>Z is a particular trait. Delta...

329
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:48,648
ED: Less technical.

330
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,792
I don't understand.

331
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,262
Humor us.

332
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,329
The selfish gene.

333
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,560
WESTCOTT: Go on.

334
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,868
Um...

335
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,570
you think a bird
will sacrifice itself for the flock,

336
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:10,944
or a bee will sting a predator
and die for the hive?

337
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,573
How noble.

338
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,140
How heroic.

339
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,915
- WESTCOTT: And it isn't true?
- DR. GELB: No, it isn't true.

340
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,718
Of course, you... you put
a snake into the cage

341
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:23,852
and one of the monkeys is a hero...
lures it away, lets it eat him.

342
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,192
But it's not heroism.
It's not selflessness.

343
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,323
forget the bees.
forget the monkey.

344
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,594
fuck the monkey.
The monkey's nothing.

345
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,363
Just think what
the monkey's made of.

346
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,470
WESTCOTT: What's that?

347
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:38,937
Genes.

348
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,472
The monkey is Just the gene's way
of making copies of itself.

349
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,575
All these monkeys,
they're all related.

350
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,184
They all share their genes.

351
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,554
So the monkey dies.
What do the genes care?

352
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,150
That's what Price proved.

353
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,695
There's no altruism in nature.

354
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,129
It's Just genes
looking after themselves.

355
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,703
How many dead monkeys so far?

356
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,934
Do you mind not smoking
in here, please?

357
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:16,074
Just imagine a hero
without a genetic motive,

358
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,548
not a relative,
not a potential mate.

359
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,551
Now, that would be
interesting, wouldn't it?

360
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,413
When did you graduate to people?

361
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,487
What do you mean?

362
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,823
Why'd you run?

363
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,093
Ketamine.

364
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,064
I thought that's why...

365
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:40,764
I've been dealing Ketamine.

366
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,397
Just a bunch of college kids.

367
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:43,963
If you want,
I can give you their names.

368
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,068
I've been so low on funding,
I've Just had to improvise.

369
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:49,113
We have four dead bodies, Dr. Gelb,

370
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,410
knocked out with your animal tranq,

371
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,916
two of them with your equation
carved into their flesh.

372
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,043
I didn't kill anyone.

373
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,611
Somebody's carving the Price equation
into people's bodies? fuck.

374
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,181
fuck! fuck!

375
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,523
I swear I didn't kill anyone.

376
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,209
- (monkeys chattering)
- He's got the animal tranqs.

377
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,576
He's got the theory,
which is a pretty freaky coincidence,

378
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,012
and he's nuts.

379
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:27,017
Well, the killer wants us
to work it out, right?

380
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,952
Why scratch your message
into the corpses?

381
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,683
- That's a tough code to crack.
- (camera shutter clicks)

382
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:35,351
We need help,
so he sends us to Dr. Gelb.

383
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,093
Gelb's had a message from God:

384
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:48,832
"Tell the world,
repent its selfishness or burn."

385
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,898
It's not Dr. Gelb.

386
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,842
Until last night, he was
at a conference at State University.

387
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,006
Whoever it is is running
an experiment like Dr. Gelb.

388
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,983
And this wack Job actually thinks
we're gonna learn fucking algebra.

389
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,986
It says love is bullshit;

390
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,956
deep down, it's Just genes, and
genes don't give a damn about love.

391
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,324
But human beings...
what's our love worth?

392
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,420
Our guy wants to know.

393
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,660
The mother of your children,
your twin brother...

394
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,702
how much pain will it take
before you kill someone you love?

395
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,102
So, I'm all wired up to Eddie, right?

396
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,072
I flip the switch. He's toast.

397
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,837
But before that he tortures you,
cuts you open,

398
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,003
cuts off your dick if he has to.

399
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,810
Love you, Eddie, but I am
gonna flick the fucking switch, man.

400
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,783
(all chuckling)

401
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:41,858
I don't think our guy is gonna stop
till he gets to the end of the equation.

402
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,688
<i>(seagulls calling)</i>

403
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:52,326
(phone rings)

404
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:54,932
I need a sandwich.

405
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,850
All I could think, man...

406
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,283
one day...

407
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,484
gots nobody.

408
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,258
Danny.

409
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,337
I think it's her.

410
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,408
I think it's Jean Lerner.

411
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,845
(cell phone ringing)

412
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,684
fucking Pierre, man.

413
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,895
Yo, what's up?

414
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:31,490
Oh, yeah?

415
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,489
Eddie. I gotta show you something.

416
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,623
Gelb's only had
three assistants in four years,

417
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,461
and one of them's on our database.

418
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,522
What for?

419
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,297
Victim in a rape and murder case.
Jean Lerner?

420
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,230
Yeah. It was my case.

421
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:22,241
Wesley Smith and Jamal Osman
were part of that gang, right?

422
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,912
Raped her and murdered her mother?

423
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:27,482
Those two plus Pierre Jackson,

424
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:30,425
Daniel Leone,
and a woman, Elly Carpenter?

425
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:35,125
ED: Elly Carpenter, the girl
with the kid in the crackhouse.

426
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:42,339
Taking on guys like that,
she'd have to be fucking Wonder Woman.

427
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:51,241
So, what happened, Eddie?
All of them walking free?

428
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,385
What the fuck happened
with forensics?

429
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,621
Contaminated.

430
00:35:58,689 --> 00:35:59,678
All of it?

431
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,122
All of it.

432
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,923
But you did get a confession
from Jamal Osman.

433
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:10,923
Corelli beat the crap out of him to get it,
so it was useless.

434
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,306
Those assholes.

435
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,871
What they did to those women
you can't believe.

436
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:25,677
(helicopter rotors whirring)

437
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,404
Eddie, we should get a warrant.

438
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,210
(glass shatters)

439
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,058
She's still living here.

440
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:28,342
She drew illustrations for...
for children's books.

441
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,679
She was living here
to take care of her...

442
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,809
take care of her mother.

443
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,588
Those bastards.

444
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,392
They didn't even steal a thing.

445
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:49,723
Nah, no point.
Just for kicks.

446
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:54,096
Cut her, snapped some fingers...

447
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,531
raped her with a bottle, broken bottle.

448
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:02,141
Tortured her for four hours,

449
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,738
and then they did her a deal.

450
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,316
They'd stop and leave her at peace

451
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:12,447
if she'd Just tell 'em
to shoot her mother.

452
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,631
Eddie, look at this.

453
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:55,689
(cell phone ringing)

454
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:00,626
Yeah?

455
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,832
WOMAN: <i>Hi. Eddie?</i>

456
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:05,205
<i>It's weird. isn't it. to talk again.</i>

457
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:07,039
Jean?

458
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:10,672
<i>I've been thinking a lot</i>
<i>about what I'd say. and...</i>

459
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,376
<i>Well. I guess Gelb</i>
<i>explained some of it.</i>

460
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,579
<i>There is a species of wasp...</i>

461
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:20,689
<i>who lays her eggs</i>
<i>in a living caterpillar.</i>

462
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:24,819
<i>The larvae eat the caterpillar</i>
<i>from the inside out.</i>

463
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:25,953
<i>organ by organ.</i>

464
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,760
Who's next, Jean?
Who you gonna test next?

465
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:32,633
<i>Can you imagine the agony</i>
<i>the caterpillar is in?</i>

466
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,639
<i>The wasp doesn't care.</i>

467
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,436
<i>Maybe that's almost beautiful.</i>

468
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,175
<i>That's motherhood.</i>

469
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:43,838
(call disconnects)

470
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,145
Call Corelli.

471
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,881
Tell him to send patrol cars
to Elly Carpenter's,

472
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,389
and I want 24-hour uniforms
on Jackson and Leone

473
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,049
and the tapes from these cameras.

474
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,320
Yeah, I need forensics at 497...

475
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,229
Danny, it's me.
Where are you?

476
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,856
DANNY: <i>I'm selling blocks.</i>

477
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:03,922
Go straight home.

478
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,265
Lock your door.
Don't open it to anybody but me.

479
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,998
I was right.
It's about the Lerner women.

480
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,175
- Who'd you call?
- What?

481
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,441
You called someone.

482
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,814
I warned Daniel Leone.

483
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,013
They don't all deserve to die.

484
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,816
Where's the fucking backup?!

485
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,530
- (ringing buzzer)
- Elly?

486
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,497
(pounding on door)

487
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,765
I should call.

488
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,306
Can't a person sleep?

489
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,604
Is your little boy here?

490
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,008
He's in bed.

491
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,739
fuck is it to you?

492
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,713
Want to fuck me, is that it?
Tight-ass bitch.

493
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,843
Dominic is not in his bed.

494
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,687
Elly, where's Dominic?

495
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,782
- Where is he?
- He's sleeping.

496
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:02,848
- Elly!
- What?

497
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,724
He's not in there!
Where is he?

498
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:06,718
Where is he?

499
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,357
Oh... uh.

500
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,525
fuck, no.

501
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,626
He's still playing out in the hall.

502
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,133
You got a problem?

503
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,196
Huh?

504
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,198
Dominic!

505
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,244
(dialing cell phone)

506
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,574
Dominic!

507
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,707
Come on, baby.
Time to come up.

508
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,149
Shut up, Elly.

509
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:37,255
(cell phone ringing)

510
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,356
- The elevator.
- Yeah.

511
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,322
ELLY: Where are you going?

512
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:46,898
Dominic?

513
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,201
(cell phone ringing)

514
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,934
Come up, baby.

515
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,999
(ringing)

516
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,774
(Dominic screams)

517
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,749
(shrieks) Dominic!

518
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,978
- Dominic!
- Elly!

519
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,576
ELLY: I'm coming!

520
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,616
Mommy's coming!

521
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,816
Elly, come back!

522
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,120
No!

523
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,684
(clattering)

524
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,491
(banging)

525
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:14,690
(gasping)

526
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,790
(elevator stops, creaks)

527
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,494
(Elly screams)

528
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,695
Elly!

529
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:25,739
(Dominic screams)

530
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,405
Dominic!

531
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,468
Elly!

532
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:31,913
Elly!

533
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:33,745
Mommy's coming!

534
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,054
(grunts)

535
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,114
Oh!

536
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,625
(Dominic screams)

537
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,787
- Dominic!
- Shit.

538
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,558
Hold on, baby!

539
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,531
- (Dominic squeals)
- ELLY: No!

540
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,010
(distant siren wails)

541
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,779
What the fuck took you so long?

542
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,180
Where have you been?

543
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,691
This is Elly fucking Carpenter.
I ain't breaking my balls for her.

544
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,625
She's got a kid, you moron!

545
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,264
You know who Just
walked away with him?

546
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,563
Jean Lerner, Jack.

547
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:01,902
That's who the killer is.

548
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,208
Jean fucking Lerner.

549
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,701
Who'd you put watching
Pierre Jackson and Danny Leone?

550
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,269
What are you telling me,
they got kids too?

551
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:11,746
'Cause I don't think so.

552
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,742
If Jean Lerner wants to bleed
those fucking scum to death,

553
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,480
maybe I ain't gonna stop her.

554
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,391
Maybe me and you
owe it to her not to stop her.

555
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,483
Huh?

556
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:29,989
Just do your fucking Job, Jack.

557
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:44,973
What?

558
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:48,246
You got something to say to me,
fucking say it.

559
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:50,977
I'm Just confused, Eddie.

560
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:55,253
You don't seem to treat Daniel Leone
like a murderer and rapist.

561
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,919
So how do you want me
to treat him, huh?

562
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,289
He's the best informer I've got.

563
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:05,825
No, he's not a murderer;
he's not a rapist.

564
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:09,202
He wasn't even in that fucking house.
He was outside in the car.

565
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,799
He was Just a kid.

566
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,441
He ain't my friend, Helen...

567
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:20,072
but there are shades
of fucking gray.

568
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,063
(pained grunting)

569
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:42,533
GANGSTER: How many white?

570
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,401
(pained grunt)

571
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,418
- MAN: Catch you later.
- MAN #2: Later, Hassan, yo.

572
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:57,181
(car engine starts)

573
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,955
Now what crazy-ass, fucked-up shit
you gonna do now?

574
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,357
That motherfucker killed Wes.

575
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,654
- CLERK: Hey, Hassan.
- Yo, what's up?

576
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:11,724
I told you, it ain't Hassan.
It's fucking Jean Lerner!

577
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,201
- B.S.
- Straight up, man.

578
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,135
Think about it, man, think!

579
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,536
Hey, yo, Hassan!

580
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,699
Hassan!

581
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,406
(screams)

582
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:23,139
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
You fucking crazy?

583
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:24,510
The fuck is wrong with you?

584
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,913
He killed Wes and Jamal.
Where's your fucking loyalty?

585
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:28,383
It was Jean Lerner!

586
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,319
fucking payback,
payback for what you done, Pierre.

587
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:32,719
for what <i>you</i> done.

588
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:37,387
- What <i>you</i> done, man!
- You're a fucking pussy!

589
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:40,386
(groans)

590
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,022
(cell phone chirps)

591
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,088
What?

592
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:48,095
Hey, Grandma.
How you doing?

593
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:52,333
You know how to use the TV, right?

594
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,674
Yeah, use the, uh...
use the remote.

595
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:58,214
Yeah... the box with the numbers on it.

596
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,375
No, no, no, other... other box...

597
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,576
with numbers on it.

598
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,142
- (crying)
- I've been running.

599
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,847
That's right. I gotta go now.

600
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,083
I love you. Love you. Okay, bye.

601
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,590
Hey, Hassan, you piece of shit.

602
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,150
(gunshots;
onlookers gasp and weep)

603
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,364
Danny, where you going?
Danny, come on, don't be like that.

604
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:16,899
- Yo, Danny!
- fuck you!

605
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,333
Don't be like this, you piece of shit.
fucking amateur!

606
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,969
(videotape rewinds)

607
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,338
CHIEF MacLEAN:
Any news on the truck?

608
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,713
WESTCOTT: It's impossible
to read the license number,

609
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:38,118
but we're checking every white
ford Econoline Van 150 from '91 to '94.

610
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,383
CHIEF MacLEAN: Do an APB,
run traces on everything...

611
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:41,651
credit cards, IRS.

612
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,886
We're gonna find this kid.

613
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,496
If Smith and Osman
failed some kind of test,

614
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,967
that three-nickel-a-blow-Job
chickenhead

615
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,936
sure as fuck ain't
gonna come through.

616
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,099
(traffic noise)

617
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:04,704
(creaking)

618
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:08,512
(pavement seams
clacking under wheels)

619
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:09,574
(gagged moan)

620
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:14,747
(muffled screaming)

621
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,927
(drawn-out muffled scream)

622
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,698
(Dominic screams)

623
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:02,672
MAN: Oh, okay.
No, it's a white truck, sir.

624
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:03,728
That's right.

625
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,402
Yeah, anytime.

626
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,723
Can I talk with him, please?

627
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,785
Go on.

628
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,462
You know, she was
the only one of my assistants

629
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:37,234
who seemed to care about the work.

630
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,907
She made drawings for me.
You saw them.

631
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:45,414
The Price equation changed her life...

632
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,841
made sense of everything.

633
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,614
And then one day,
she... she didn't come in.

634
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:02,927
You know, I can see
the monkey in you.

635
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,661
(chuckles)

636
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:26,954
- Hey.
- Hey.

637
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,823
- (perfunctory knock)
- Daniel Leone's an informer.

638
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:12,194
I mean, he is an informer, right?

639
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:14,968
What's your point?

640
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:16,767
Cops use him as a dealer...

641
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,206
and for sure he's not the only one.

642
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:21,369
Cops do coke. I get that.

643
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:25,313
I wasn't born yesterday,
and I know shit happens,

644
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:28,112
but the Lerner case, sir,
it's hard to believe.

645
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:31,177
I mean, it was a fiasco.

646
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,554
Getting a confession
but covering the guy in bruises?

647
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:36,057
Of course it wasn't gonna fly.

648
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,822
And you think
they fucked it up for drugs?

649
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:40,385
Is that what you're saying?

650
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:45,425
No, I...

651
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:51,129
but maybe they're in too deep
and it's clouding their Judgment.

652
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:54,405
My priority, Detective,
is a missing kid.

653
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:58,141
If you want to make it your crusade
to clean up this precinct...

654
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:00,207
be my guest.

655
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,080
No one's gonna thank you, though.

656
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:10,715
(Danny whistles)

657
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,092
(whistles sharply) Eddie.

658
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,098
What are you doing there?

659
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:22,196
Didn't I tell you to stay at home?

660
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,105
I Just figured I'd be safer here.

661
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:30,037
What happened?

662
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,547
It was fucking Pierre.

663
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:34,743
He killed Hassan, man.

664
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,047
She's got Elly, Elly and her kid.

665
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,112
fuck.

666
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,216
Took them from
right under my fucking nose.

667
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,757
What if you don't find her?

668
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,070
I'll book you.

669
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,086
(metal door slams)

670
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,246
(silence)

671
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,523
(silence)

672
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,633
(silence)

673
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,839
(indistinct police radio chatter)

674
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,602
There.

675
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,377
(moaning softly)

676
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,988
MAN: Sir, no parking here.
Police business.

677
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,360
Take it out of here.

678
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,491
Should've been you got fried.

679
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,695
(Elly crying)

680
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,645
Did you see who did this?

681
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,720
Was it a woman?
Was it... was it Jean Lerner?

682
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,721
It was me.

683
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,995
I killed him.

684
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,099
(rasping) I killed my baby!

685
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,797
I killed my baby.

686
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:47,773
(cigarette lighter clicks)

687
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,903
(Elly screams)

688
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:54,077
(Elly sobs sporadically)

689
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,793
I killed him.

690
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:54,406
How did the case
get fucked up so bad?

691
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:59,648
Crime like that, must have
been a lot of DNA evidence.

692
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:00,910
None of it would stick?

693
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:03,646
JACK: Yeah, that's right. The bathroom
on the next floor, flooded lab.

694
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,210
Everything got wet, okay?

695
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:07,950
Kids busted up the crime scene
before we could re-collect.

696
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:09,651
- And the gun?
- Never found.

697
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:13,321
And what, you figured
if you beat a confession from Jamal

698
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:14,954
the D.A. would let it go?

699
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,862
Listen, you cunt.

700
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,800
If you'd seen what they did,
that fucking scum,

701
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,632
you might've lost it a bit too.

702
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,670
(whispers) What the fuck.

703
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,119
Gotta talk to Danny Leone.

704
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:40,011
Right. I'll come with you.

705
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,147
No, you don't.

706
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:43,317
- This is not acceptable, Eddie!
- What?

707
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:48,528
Just because you got a history
doesn't make this your personal mission.

708
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:50,532
What do you mean, history?

709
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,465
What are you talking about?

710
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,537
I'm gonna persuade him to be bait.

711
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:03,636
He's trying to protect you, okay?

712
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:04,873
fuck you.

713
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,216
GUARD: Hey, Eddie?

714
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,420
- Man, did you find...
- Shut up!

715
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,018
Just shut up.

716
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,028
You were Just driving the car, right?

717
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:25,933
You were Just outside in the car.

718
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:34,808
What happened?

719
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:41,639
- You tortured that woman.
- I-I did not...

720
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:44,312
- You fucking raped her.
- I didn't rape her!

721
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:47,652
- You were in that fucking house.
- I didn't kill nobody, man.

722
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,453
What did you do to those women?
You were in there!

723
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,556
Man, I didn't lay a finger, a'ight?

724
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,124
I was Just in the hall.

725
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,867
You were in the hall?

726
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:03,769
I was Just in the hall, man.

727
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,107
You were in there?

728
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,043
Oh, Jesus!

729
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,607
Jesus!

730
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,517
And you weren't Just
in the fucking hall, were you?

731
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:24,985
Were you?

732
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:31,522
I...

733
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:34,358
I wasn't.

734
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:36,970
'Kay?

735
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:42,609
Eddie, I didn't do nothing, man.

736
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:47,877
I swear, I thought we Just gonna gank
some Jewelry and bust the fuck out.

737
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:50,681
Pierre was fucking out of control, man.

738
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:53,415
I couldn't stop him.
I couldn't do anything.

739
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,582
I didn't want no part of it, man.

740
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:00,656
Remember seeing Elly.

741
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,689
She was Just standing over her...

742
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:09,097
with a bottle...

743
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,330
covered in blood, man.

744
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:13,807
I couldn't fucking handle it.

745
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:18,205
I went and sat on the stairs
like a fucking pussy, a'ight?

746
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,942
(sniffling)

747
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,243
You could've done something.

748
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,051
You could've called the fucking cops.

749
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,784
You had the gun, Danny.

750
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:30,985
You could've blown
Pierre's fucking brains out.

751
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,392
I was a kid.
I don't know nobody else.

752
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,322
Who was gonna have my back?

753
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,156
You?

754
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,837
I didn't lay a finger.

755
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:46,602
You know me, Eddie.

756
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,639
Yeah.

757
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,478
No, Danny isn't such a bad guy.

758
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:58,417
Pierre is the fucking devil.

759
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:02,049
Danny Just gets caught up
in things, right?

760
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:05,250
I should've done something.

761
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,626
You're Just a low-life
fucking dope whore.

762
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,172
What does that make me?

763
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,541
She'll be coming for you,
you know that.

764
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:28,973
She'll come for you...

765
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:31,814
and someone you care about.

766
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:36,120
Who do you love?

767
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:40,124
Is there anyone you love?

768
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:46,497
(banging sound)

769
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:48,560
(cart rolling)

770
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:50,629
(heavy object sliding)

771
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,367
(wheels squeaking)

772
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:05,816
(current humming)

773
01:02:14,163 --> 01:02:16,495
(soft groans)

774
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,432
(inhales, gasps)

775
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:37,411
I'm gonna fucking kill you, bitch.

776
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,547
Bitch.

777
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:47,554
Bitch. You called me that before,

778
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,222
when you were cutting me.

779
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,831
Do you remember cutting me?

780
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:56,838
Yeah, and I remember how you
fucking screamed like a bitch.

781
01:02:56,906 --> 01:03:00,137
In fact, my cock is getting hard
thinking about you right fucking now!

782
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,267
(spits)

783
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:03,335
My mom used to say...

784
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,844
before we killed her...

785
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:10,044
(whispers) You.

786
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,385
...that if they act like wild beasts
it's not their fault...

787
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,022
so deep down...

788
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,526
you're still the little boy
your grandmother loved.

789
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,562
WOMAN: Pierre?

790
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:39,211
Where is the little boy you loved?

791
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:41,045
(moans)

792
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:46,620
It's okay, Grandma.
It's okay, all right.

793
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:53,121
(gently) S-so you take care
of your grandmother, right, Pierre?

794
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,063
I mean, you love her...

795
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:02,063
but I wonder how much.

796
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:05,733
(muttering) Where you going?
Where you going? Where you going?

797
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:14,772
Aw...

798
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:23,958
If you want the pain to stop...

799
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,323
Aw, man.

800
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:26,827
...there's the switch.

801
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:31,497
Or you can lay down your life...

802
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,558
Oh, man, my fingers!

803
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,160
...if you love her enough.

804
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:37,399
(whimpers)

805
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:39,065
But there will be pain.

806
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:40,267
I don't want...

807
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:42,106
Aah!

808
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:44,169
(footsteps approaching)

809
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:09,697
Sorry.

810
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,577
Hey, uh, I can be too quick to Judge.

811
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:21,674
It's a flaw in my character, I'm told.

812
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,712
Look, if you think Danny Leone's
not such a bad guy, what do I know?

813
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:31,851
He's the scum of the fucking earth.

814
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,259
(engine starts)

815
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:30,710
(sighs heavily)

816
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:32,344
(clicks teeth)

817
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:35,687
Hey, Eddie.

818
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:38,553
Where's your grandma?

819
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,322
You killed her, right?

820
01:06:43,399 --> 01:06:44,593
PIERRE: Oh, man.

821
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,693
Man, I did her a fucking favor, man.

822
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:51,767
Where did Jean Lerner take you?

823
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,775
What the fuck do you care?

824
01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:00,515
I was fu... I was unconscious.

825
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,915
I don't know where we went.

826
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:09,218
Ain't no fucking cavalry gonna
Just ride in for me, Eddie.

827
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:12,089
Only person that's looking after me...

828
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:13,958
is me.

829
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,490
You would've done the same.

830
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:23,864
Anybody...

831
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,633
would have done the same.

832
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:30,969
She didn't cut you up
like Wesley and Jamal.

833
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:33,905
(winces)

834
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:56,026
Come on.

835
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:15,956
fucking fuck!

836
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:22,690
Elly's the only one that got to me.

837
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:28,664
The others, it'd be a miracle
if they passed her test...

838
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:34,871
but I did think a mother
would do anything for her child.

839
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,741
Well, you never met mine, then.

840
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:39,075
(gunshot)

841
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,576
(gunshot)

842
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:49,757
You want kids?

843
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:55,121
No.

844
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:59,057
We talked about it.

845
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,533
With that guy
who walked out on you...

846
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,574
the one who thinks
you're a self-righteous bitch?

847
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,471
He didn't walk out on me.

848
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,374
I threw him out.

849
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:18,147
Yeah, I figured that out.

850
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,619
God, no one would pass
Jean Lerner's test.

851
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:26,490
How'd you get so bitter?

852
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:31,900
You spend seven years
with someone...

853
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:35,264
you think it counts for something.

854
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:39,472
Doesn't matter how many times
a guy says he loves you.

855
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,908
In the end, it doesn't mean a thing.

856
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:44,502
So, this guy hurt you.

857
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:45,638
I get it.

858
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,978
Well, maybe he loved you.
Now, that's something.

859
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:56,748
You gotta bleed
to know there's blood,

860
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:58,918
to know your heart is beating.

861
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:04,824
Someone will love you...

862
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:07,363
if you're lucky...

863
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:12,699
and when they do,
Just fucking grab it...

864
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,874
with both hands.

865
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:27,085
Let's go.

866
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:35,427
She won't try to take him
until it's dark.

867
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:38,023
Take an officer with you.

868
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:39,499
Just two guys?

869
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:43,334
We don't want to scare her off,
do we?

870
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,609
How's it hanging, Danny?

871
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:31,809
(elevated train rumbles)

872
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:48,126
It's not my idea of a night out either,
fuckface, watching your ass.

873
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:49,227
Come on.

874
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:56,767
Hey!

875
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,004
Ah, fuck you.

876
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:02,949
(engine revving)

877
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:11,091
(phone rings)

878
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:14,319
- Yep?
- CLERK: Two-fifty.

879
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:15,590
JACK: <i>Hey.</i>

880
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:18,497
<i>Apparently Leone</i>
<i>doesn't trust us to look after him.</i>

881
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:20,832
<i>Just took off.</i>

882
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:25,699
Was that Corelli? Eddie.

883
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:30,636
What's going on?

884
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:48,660
(phone ringing)

885
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:50,392
(engine knocking)

886
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,789
Come on, boy.

887
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,597
Shit.

888
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,797
What is this shit?

889
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,333
<i>Yo. it's Danny.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

890
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:01,398
(beep)

891
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:03,570
Danny, what the fuck
are you playing at? Call me.

892
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:11,309
(engine stalls)

893
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:21,086
Hey, hey, man!

894
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:22,596
You give me some help?

895
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:24,222
WOMAN: Don't listen to him, Marty.

896
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:26,358
Look right here.
Look into my face.

897
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:31,429
(liquid spilling)

898
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:37,539
Oh. Shit.

899
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:47,046
Aah! Aah! Aah!

900
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:58,489
Hey! Unh!

901
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:00,962
JEAN: You okay?

902
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,298
- MAN: Hey!
- JEAN: You all right?

903
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:06,102
You all right, man?
What happened?

904
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:08,405
He Just dropped.
He hit his head pretty hard.

905
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:11,537
It seems kind of serious.
I think we should get him to the hospital.

906
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,012
I should call an ambulance.

907
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:15,606
No, it could take an hour or more.

908
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,879
You know what,
I work at Mercy Hospital.

909
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:21,719
Why don't... why don't I Just
get him in my van, drop him off?

910
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,691
It's okay. Let's get him.
Let's get him in there.

911
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,819
- (groans)
- You're gonna be okay.

912
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:29,963
Yeah, I got the doors.

913
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:33,723
It's okay.

914
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,227
Okay, got you.

915
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,466
Got your head.

916
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:39,871
It's okay.

917
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:41,967
You're gonna be
at the hospital real soon.

918
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,807
Thank you so much.

919
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:48,679
Most people nowadays
won't even stop to help.

920
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:57,851
(phone rings)

921
01:14:57,926 --> 01:14:59,120
Danny?

922
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,924
JEAN: <i>No. Hey. it's me.</i>

923
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:06,192
Leave Daniel alone.
He didn't do anything.

924
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:07,758
<i>Have they told you?</i>

925
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:10,327
<i>Danny ran off from his police escort.</i>

926
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:11,929
<i>Stupid of him.</i>

927
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,497
(sighs)

928
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:16,305
<i>Don't you want to know</i>
<i>where to find Daniel?</i>

929
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:19,208
<i>Eddie?</i>

930
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:20,305
(door creaks open)

931
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:23,108
Let's go.

932
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,752
(tires squealing)

933
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:48,567
Jean!

934
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:57,512
ED: Danny!

935
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:01,981
Jean!

936
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,046
WESTCOTT: Eddie.

937
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:18,302
(water dripping)

938
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:21,999
(distant elevated train rolling)

939
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,251
(cell phone ringing)

940
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:12,385
Where is he?

941
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,190
Eddie?

942
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,423
- Is it her?
- It's Jean.

943
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:19,195
Eddie, give me the phone.

944
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:20,666
Come on.

945
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:23,227
JEAN: <i>What you did for those fuckers...</i>

946
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,332
<i>for one of them. anyway...</i>

947
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:31,276
<i>it's incredible...</i>

948
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:35,416
<i>that nobody's figured it all out yet...</i>

949
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:38,982
<i>or maybe they have.</i>

950
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:44,219
<i>but did they figure out why?</i>

951
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:48,128
<i>I mean. the truth</i>
<i>about Daniel Leone?</i>

952
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:51,622
<i>I mean what you've been hiding.</i>

953
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:55,828
<i>I've got him.</i>

954
01:17:58,540 --> 01:17:59,632
<i>Daniel.</i>

955
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:03,834
(siren approaching)

956
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:08,472
(patrol car doors open and close)

957
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:12,209
(siren approaching)

958
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:15,518
(distant policeman shouting)

959
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:21,487
Ed, what's going on?

960
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:24,524
Ed.

961
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:38,102
(tires squeal)

962
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,841
(siren wailing)

963
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:47,711
Hey.

964
01:18:49,858 --> 01:18:51,348
(screams)

965
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:53,451
(truck horn blares)

966
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:15,105
(panting)

967
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:19,252
Don't play any
fucking games with me.

968
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:20,652
Tell me where he is...

969
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:23,351
or I blow your head off.

970
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:28,728
If you shoot me, Eddie,
you'll never find him.

971
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:29,786
(hisses)

972
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:32,163
He'll starve to death.

973
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,399
(crying)

974
01:20:06,101 --> 01:20:07,534
Have you hurt him?

975
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:10,994
Eddie...

976
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:35,059
You don't have to find a vein.

977
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:36,961
Anywhere will do.

978
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:19,032
(grunts)

979
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:44,124
(woman speaks
over police radio)

980
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:46,030
MAN: Come on, guys,
let's wrap him up.

981
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:00,980
It was Eddie's idea to beat up
Jamal Osman, wasn't it?

982
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:11,519
Yeah, well, it didn't take
too much fucking persuasion.

983
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,788
Confession had to be unusable.

984
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:16,194
Eddie made sure it wasn't,
got you to do it.

985
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:19,131
What are you talking about?

986
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,829
fuck, he must've paid those kids
to smash up the crime scene...

987
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:25,870
flooded the lav himself.

988
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:33,180
All these deaths are Eddie's fault.

989
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:39,651
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

990
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:48,989
(current humming)

991
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,172
(liquid sloshing)

992
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:14,187
Jean.

993
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:28,164
Your face always made me
feel safer, Eddie.

994
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,263
You look older.

995
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:36,807
Well, it's taken its toll, I guess.

996
01:23:37,946 --> 01:23:38,935
Yeah.

997
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:41,839
It's taken its toll.

998
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:46,915
The fuck are we gonna do, Eddie?

999
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:49,218
I'm sorry, Danny.

1000
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:51,224
Eddie, what are we gonna do, man?

1001
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:54,086
Help! fuck.

1002
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:57,563
Oh! So you think
someone's gonna save you.

1003
01:23:57,632 --> 01:23:59,793
Get me out of this chair!

1004
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:02,166
But no one can hear you.

1005
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:04,000
No one knows you're here.

1006
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:08,804
And if they did,
they'd probably Just turn up the TV.

1007
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:11,539
ED: Don't let those bastards win.

1008
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:12,637
Jean.

1009
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:16,741
Don't let them make you
into this person.

1010
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:19,412
See, I don't enjoy any of this!

1011
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:21,546
You understand that, right?

1012
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:22,851
ED: I know.

1013
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:24,289
I <i>know.</i>

1014
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:32,427
You killed a three-year-old boy, Jean.

1015
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:36,127
He was Just a little boy.

1016
01:24:36,204 --> 01:24:38,434
No, I didn't kill him.

1017
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:40,999
His mother did.

1018
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,067
What's any of this prove, Jean?

1019
01:24:43,144 --> 01:24:44,668
fuck! Stop!

1020
01:24:44,746 --> 01:24:46,941
Elly was a coward,
you were a coward, I am a coward.

1021
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:48,141
What the fuck are you doing?

1022
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,844
Same as every fucking animal
in the Jungle, Jean.

1023
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,853
That's right, Eddie,
that's what it proves.

1024
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,548
(screams)

1025
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:57,318
- (stifles scream)
- DANNY: Shit. What are you doing?

1026
01:24:57,392 --> 01:24:59,326
Oh, shit!

1027
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:01,328
Help!

1028
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:03,489
Help us! Come on!

1029
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:05,533
(siren blaring)

1030
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:18,872
- MAN: Wait till forensics...
- (telephone ringing)

1031
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:24,941
(Eddie's cell phone ringing)

1032
01:25:36,097 --> 01:25:37,860
JACK: Put a car up there.

1033
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:39,627
Seal the whole fucking area.

1034
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:41,692
MAN: Yes, sir.
What about here?

1035
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:47,574
(screaming)

1036
01:25:50,044 --> 01:25:52,069
Help!

1037
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:56,584
After I killed my mother,
all I thought about was dying.

1038
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:58,642
I mean, even waking up was pain.

1039
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,483
Oh, but then...

1040
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:03,183
the equation, it was all so clear.

1041
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:07,695
It wasn't about what you did,
Eddie, or what I did.

1042
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:11,596
I mean, we were part
of something so much bigger.

1043
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:13,600
It's fucking ugly!

1044
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:16,933
Well, Gelb thinks it's beautiful.

1045
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,529
(gasping) Oh, fu...

1046
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:19,664
DANNY: Eddie!

1047
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:27,442
One night you came
to see me in the hospital,

1048
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:30,177
and I was sobbing in your arms.

1049
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,911
And I believed you.

1050
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:36,480
I believed...

1051
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:41,288
that you were sincere

1052
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:43,387
and that you were angry...

1053
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:46,629
and that you cared about me.

1054
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:51,335
I did.

1055
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:53,033
I did care.

1056
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:07,414
(sighs)

1057
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:13,124
No, 'cause the day that...
the day that the case collapsed...

1058
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:21,635
I went to your house to Just...

1059
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:24,901
tell you that I didn't blame you.

1060
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:31,335
Well, I guess I Just really wanted
to see you, I think...

1061
01:27:33,715 --> 01:27:34,943
'cause you were...

1062
01:27:36,451 --> 01:27:40,319
(voice hardens) the only one
who really understood...

1063
01:27:41,956 --> 01:27:43,480
what I'd been through.

1064
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,695
And then I saw you both there.

1065
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:00,836
Whatever happened
to Daniel's gun?

1066
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:12,514
I threw it in the river.

1067
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:13,884
Eddie.

1068
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:15,913
What the fuck?!

1069
01:28:17,025 --> 01:28:18,151
What, you didn't know?

1070
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:22,855
God, if you weren't so pretty,
you'd be safely in Jail.

1071
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:26,734
I wasn't worth it, Eddie.

1072
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,162
I wasn't worth it.

1073
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:37,233
I... I ne-never wanted to hurt you.

1074
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,303
Oh, I know I was never a factor,

1075
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,813
because what you did, Eddie...

1076
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:44,409
God, you know, I couldn't
understand for two years

1077
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:47,977
the sheer pain of what
you put me through,

1078
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:50,183
of what you did to me!

1079
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:51,953
- Jean.
- But then with the equation...

1080
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:54,461
...then it all made sense.

1081
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:55,894
EDDIE: Please, Jean.

1082
01:28:55,963 --> 01:28:57,658
You were no different.

1083
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:02,896
You were no different than Pierre...

1084
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:06,064
- (screams)
...or Jamal or Elly or me!

1085
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:09,075
You do fucking enjoy this!

1086
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:10,132
You do!

1087
01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:11,200
Bitch!

1088
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:15,340
Say, "You do
fucking enjoy this, <i>bi..."</i>

1089
01:29:15,416 --> 01:29:17,145
(vomits)

1090
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:19,118
DANNY: I didn't say that!

1091
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:20,586
(chokes, spits)

1092
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:23,749
This should be so easy for you.

1093
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:27,920
I mean, you're not related.

1094
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:29,792
You're not gonna have kids.

1095
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:33,130
I'm sorry.

1096
01:29:33,201 --> 01:29:36,398
Danny, I'm sorry.

1097
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:37,904
It's not your fault.

1098
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:39,803
(coughs) Please, Jean.

1099
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:42,402
Please.

1100
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:45,602
JEAN: Oh, and then what, Eddie?

1101
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:48,012
You're Just gonna let me
walk out of here in peace?

1102
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,207
I mean...

1103
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:53,944
yeah...

1104
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,818
maybe you would.

1105
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:58,358
Ohh! fu...

1106
01:29:58,426 --> 01:29:59,450
(Danny screams)

1107
01:30:00,695 --> 01:30:01,593
(door crashes open)

1108
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,171
(water trickling)

1109
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,784
(answering machine beeping)

1110
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:39,193
ED: <i>Hi. it's me.</i>
<i>Are you out tonight?</i>

1111
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:42,464
<i>Call me when you get this.</i>

1112
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:46,400
<i>I had a... I had a rough day.</i>

1113
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:49,835
<i>I really need you...</i>

1114
01:30:51,512 --> 01:30:52,501
<i>bad tonight.</i>

1115
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,569
fuck!

1116
01:30:53,648 --> 01:30:55,479
(crashing)

1117
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:57,541
I don't want to hear this.

1118
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,582
(beep)

1119
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:06,821
(choking)

1120
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:11,464
(crying) Eddie.

1121
01:31:11,532 --> 01:31:13,363
fucking help him, man.

1122
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:16,228
Shit.

1123
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:24,972
(Danny crying)

1124
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,946
Don't make me kill him.

1125
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:32,511
JEAN: (sighs) Eddie.

1126
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:35,647
I know what it's like
to have to make the choice

1127
01:31:35,723 --> 01:31:37,247
you're gonna have to make.

1128
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:43,162
Just flick the switch.

1129
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:53,807
You still believe he loves you.

1130
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,908
How did it start?

1131
01:32:03,985 --> 01:32:06,010
He arrested me.

1132
01:32:08,122 --> 01:32:10,852
(stuttering)

1133
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:13,018
About a year before...

1134
01:32:14,962 --> 01:32:16,020
you.

1135
01:32:16,097 --> 01:32:19,897
And he let you off for a price,

1136
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:21,764
is that how it worked?

1137
01:32:23,604 --> 01:32:24,593
Yeah.

1138
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:33,439
JEAN: So, you used him
to stay out of Jail.

1139
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:44,082
He doesn't love you, Eddie.

1140
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:47,025
If this was his choice,
you'd be long dead by now.

1141
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:52,431
flick the switch.
It's what we all do.

1142
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:57,398
There is... no love.

1143
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:02,402
DANNY: (crying) Sorry, man.

1144
01:33:04,312 --> 01:33:06,212
So fucking sorry.

1145
01:33:24,231 --> 01:33:25,391
Kill me.

1146
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:28,429
Eddie...

1147
01:33:31,372 --> 01:33:33,738
You want me to kill you?

1148
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:38,478
I don't care if he loves me.

1149
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,738
Let him go.

1150
01:33:54,662 --> 01:33:56,323
In my life...

1151
01:33:58,032 --> 01:34:00,694
...you're the only thing I don't regret.

1152
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:04,464
(Jean opens drawer)

1153
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:20,552
Oh, shit.

1154
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:24,552
Oh!

1155
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:28,255
(sniffs) Oh, shit.

1156
01:34:30,731 --> 01:34:32,062
I'm scared.

1157
01:34:36,604 --> 01:34:37,901
Eddie.

1158
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:41,032
- Eddie!
- (blood trickling)

1159
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:42,871
f-fuck.

1160
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:51,516
(Jean cries softly)

1161
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:55,822
Thank you.

1162
01:35:08,169 --> 01:35:11,036
DANNY: (sobs) Eddie, shit!

1163
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:40,890
(sirens wailing)

1164
01:35:44,505 --> 01:35:45,904
DANNY: Get me out!

1165
01:35:45,973 --> 01:35:48,908
- MAN: fuck.
- Get me out of here!

1166
01:35:48,976 --> 01:35:49,806
Clear!

1167
01:35:49,977 --> 01:35:50,966
Clear.

1168
01:36:22,676 --> 01:36:23,700
(door slams)

1169
01:36:27,948 --> 01:36:29,848
Let's move back.
Let's move, move!

1170
01:36:35,589 --> 01:36:36,783
fuck off!

1171
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:54,007
What the fuck
are you looking at?

1172
01:37:53,638 --> 01:37:54,638
