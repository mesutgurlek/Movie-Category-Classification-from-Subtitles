57
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,961

-That was weird 
 -Yeah, people get lost out here, should I go get her?

66
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:45,422

 -What do you mean?

74
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:17,628
I don't think a roadtrip is such a good idea right now.  I called Mike, he's gonna come out get me in the morning.

75
00:17:23,402 --> 00:17:25,589

James, where are you?  That girl came back.  That girl!, I mean, she keeps, she keeps knocking on the door.

93
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:20,429
What do you mean, I heard her voice

94
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,397
No, I didn't open the door.

(phone disconnects)

103
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:54,146

00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:21,966
What are you thinking..?

154
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:29,641
It's since we've been here, I haven't heard a dog park, not a car pass.  Nothing.

155
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:34,808
Just us and "them"

156
00:38:35,394 --> 00:38:39,431
-Why are they doing this? 
 -Listen, I don't want you to think about that OK?

157
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:41,808
Don't think about it..

158
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,777
It doesn't matter right now.

159
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:48,485
The only reason is if they'd come through that door..Ok?

160
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:17,853
-What is it? 
 -It's my phone, we gotta get out of here..

161
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:43,883
-Shit!  -Who is
that?  -I don't know

162
00:39:45,337 --> 00:39:48,649
(engine reving)

163

(Doors and windows closing, horn blowing outside)

169
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:31,082
-James, we need a gun 
 -I'm looking

170
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,270
-Does your dad have a gun? 
 -Kristen, I'm looking!!  There was one here when as a kid, he always hid it.

171
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:41,696
(horn continues to blow outside)

172
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:52,458
Let's go to the bedroom..

173
00:41:03,415 --> 00:41:08,457
Oh my God...

174

175
00:41:27,926 --> 00:41:29,862
-What are you doing? 
 -Looking for bullets

176
00:41:35,189 --> 00:41:37,954
Got em, got em, I got em

177
00:41:50,393 --> 00:41:55,297
-I don't know how to use this thing..  -What
do you mean?  -I'm not sure even how to load it.

178
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:57,662
-But you said you used to hunt with your dad..


179
00:41:57,662 --> 00:42:00,578
-No, I never did, it's just something that I said.

180
00:42:17,546 --> 00:42:20,719
I'm gonna open the door, and I just want you to run, OK?

181
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:25,235
(door breaks!) 
 -(screaming) AHHHHHHH!

182
00:42:25,531 --> 00:42:27,796
