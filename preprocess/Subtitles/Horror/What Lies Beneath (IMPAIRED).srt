- Oh!
- Claire, look at you.
You look beautiful!

- Oh, well, Norman grew up here--

- His father worked here.

- How's Caitlin?
- They just sacked him.

- I just dropped her off at college.
- For what?

- Some stalking incident
with an intern, some girl.
- Oh, God, Claire.

- Michael who?

- Marlov.
- Claire's first husband.

well, one night,
um, after a concert,

I met a dashing, handsome,

and three months later
I was married.

Ohh. Now, is that--

is that when you guys
moved up to Vermont?

- No, we were living in Boston...
- No, we were in Boston.

when Norman was, um,
offered a position.

So now you're teaching
at your father's school.

Uh, well, I actually
don't do much teaching anymore.

She drives around in a souped-up
Mustang convertible.

Most people around here think
she's off tooling around Mexico
somewhere with her fiends.

Oh, well, that sounds about right.

I never understood how
a girl that wild got all A's.

She liked to read a lot, though.

Sometimes she'd lock herself up
in her room for days, just reading.

I don't know where she got it.
She didn't get it from me.

01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:44,587
{y:i}She probably got it from
{y:i}her father's side of the family.

668
01:04:46,725 --> 01:04:49,091
She never really
mentioned her father.
