- Let's go get lover-boy!

318
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,837
I'm gonna kill you, kid!

319
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,070
Not so fast, that's my kid.

320

- Ricochet O'Connell.

321
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,069
- Hey, hey.
- EVELYN: What are you doing here?

322
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,913
- Alex! Sweetheart! Are you all right?
- Just a little family get-together, folks.

323
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,276
Come on,
let's get back to having a good time. Music!

324

on anything, you...

327
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,354
- Why are you here?
- Ricochet, he had his hands all over me girl.

328
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,635
Now, son or no son,
I gotta give him a beating!

- Get out of the way, Dad.
- Sit down.

Now as much as I'd really like you
to teach him a valuable lesson...

331
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,352
His mother would be upset! Very upset.

332
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,919
You have a lot of explaining to do,
young man.

333
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,149
I got a wife now, and a kid.

334
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,310
Things are a little bit different,
I'm sure you understand.

335
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,038
- Yeah.
- Let me make it up to you.

336
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,316
We're just surprised to see you here.
That's all.

for all this damage?

All right?

339
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,149
I'm not here five minutes,

340
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,037
and I'm already pulling your fanny
out of the fire.

How'd you think this was gonna work, Dad?
You two show up, tell me what to do?

343
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,598
No. But we should sit down
and discuss this like a family.

344
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,353
No offence, Mom,
but we haven't been a family in a long time.

345
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,396
Hey, don't you turn your back on me. Alex!

346
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,710

347
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,073

- My fault?

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,078
You're the one
that's always smothering him.

352
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,594
You couldn't leave him alone
for five minutes without wiping his nose.

353
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,275
Perhaps I was overcompensating for the fact
that you never took an interest in his life.

354
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,920
His life was my top priority.

355
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,468
How many times did I save that kid
from breaking his neck?

356
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,710
A little warmth and encouragement
would have been nice.

357

I'm his father. It's implied.

searching for priceless artefacts,

- No, we can't.

we get to see your first big discovery.

I'm surprised you want to see it at all.

after the official red tape has been cut.

Do the words "rest in peace"
mean anything to you two?

So, Mom, why don't you stick around
for the next few days,

00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,354

that we're here. You know...

that only a drop of blood

from a person of pure heart
can open the Eye.

My family has watched

The Emperor cannot be killed unless

What do you really know about this girl?

Well, not much, but after her help tonight,
I'm willing to go on a little faith.

591
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,197
- Faith.
- Time is running out.

592
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,669
You don't really believe in the concept
of personal space, do you?

593
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,116
If the Emperor reaches Shangri-La
and drinks from the Pool of Eternal Life,

594
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,953
he will raise his army
and no one will be safe.

595
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,474
Much as I'd like to stay
this boyishly handsome forever,

596
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,959
Shangri-La is a crock.

597
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,917
Yeah, but that's what you used to say
about mummies, too, Jon.

598
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,036
- You did pretty well off it.
- Good point.

599
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:20,352
The Gateway to Shangri-La lies in
a mountain pass high in the Himalayas.

600
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,510
Beyond it is a golden tower.

601
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,149
Once the diamond is placed at the top,
it will point the way to Shangri-La.

602
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,196
Yang still has the diamond,

603
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,158
and that's where
he and the Emperor will go.

604
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,669
She's right.

605
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,718
All the legends of the Eye
mention the Gateway.

606
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,870
I like her, Alex. She knows what's what.

607
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:43,239
Now, just say that we were to believe you,
could you guide us there?

608
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,596
Yes. I have been there once.
I remember the way.

Well, I know just the Mad Dog for the job.

611
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,478
MAGUIRE: Well, any self-respecting pilot
would land on the valley floor,

612
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,232
but I don't have any self-respect,

613
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,470
so I'll put you down
halfway up the mountain.

614
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,232
That should give us a good advantage.

615
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,311
MAGUIRE: Of course,
I can't guarantee any of us will live.

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,549
Great!

- We go to plan B.

Plan B! You go upstairs,
you blow up that gold tower thing.

- You! What?
- Dad?

00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,396
So if the explosion doesn't kill us,
the avalanche will.

- You got a better idea?
- Yeah. I do.

with long-range rifles and silencers.

Long-range, that's a better idea.
