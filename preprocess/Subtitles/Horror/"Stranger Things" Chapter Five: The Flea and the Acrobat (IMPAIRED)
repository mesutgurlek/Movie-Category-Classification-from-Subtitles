- [gun cocking]
- Hands up. Hands up!

11
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

12
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,500
Forgot all the cameras, bub?

13
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,460
Look, Dr. Brenner asked
for me specifically. Okay?

14
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,726
How else do you think
I got in here?

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,790
[Hopper scoffs]

16
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,590
What's your name again?

17
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,380
It's Jim Hopper.

18
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,170
Chief Jim Hopper.

19
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,140
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper...
[grunts]

20

[indistinct radio chatter]

23
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,440
Hey...

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,020
you mind if I borrow this one?

25
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,440

- [liquid pouring]
- [Lonnie] Drink.

28
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,790
It'll calm your nerves.

29
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,120
Help you think straight, yeah?

30
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,750
I don't know what to do.

31
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,590
I know. I know.

32
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,260
[sniffs] This whole time...

33
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,600
I... I could... I could feel him.

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,980
He was...

35
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,060
He was so close.
He was... he was right there.

36
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,900
- I knew he was alive.
- [thunder rumbles]

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,780
Our hands...
our hands were almost touching.

38
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,860
Now it's like I... uh...

39
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,160
[sobbing] God, it's like
I can't feel him anymore.

40
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,290
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

41
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,420
Like how everybody is looking at me.

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,420
- Like I'm out of my damn mind.
- Hey.

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,420
You're not gonna like this,

44
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,090
but I think you need to seriously consider
the possibility that all this...

45
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,470
It's in your head.

46
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,850
[scoffs]

47
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,980
- You remember your Aunt Darlene?
- No.

48
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,020
No, this is not that.

49
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,376
I mean, when something like this happens,

50
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,440
your mind makes up stuff
for you to cope, you know?

51
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,006
I mean, Jesus, there's a funeral
tomorrow for our little boy

52
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,950
and you're saying his body is fake.

53
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,490
He's in the wall.

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,160
I mean, how do you explain that?

55
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,580
- [stammers]
- It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't.

56
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,380
- At least go talk to a shrink or...
- [sighs]

57
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,510
- What about Pastor Charles or someone...
- I don't... Well, they can't help.

58
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,470
Joyce, you just told me...

59
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,800
that Will is gone.

60
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,850
- What else is there to do?
- [sniffles]

61
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,390
Hey.

62
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,530
[sniffles]

63
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,160
[Hopper] Will?

64
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,620
Will?

65
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,290
Will?

66
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,460
Will?

67
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,280
[Mike] What was Will saying?

68
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,570
Like home... Like home...

69
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,450
but dark?

70
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,780
[Lucas] And empty.

71
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,330
[sighs] Empty and cold.
Wait, did he say cold?

72
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,500
I don't know.
The stupid radio kept going in and out.

73
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,056
[sighs] It's like riddles in the dark.

74
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,960
Like home.
Like his house?

75
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,300
Or maybe like Hawkins.

76
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,920
Upside down.

77
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,260
- What'd she say?
- Upside down.

78
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,890
- [Lucas] What?
- Upside down.

79
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,770
When El showed us where Will was,
she flipped the board over, remember?

80
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,810
Upside down.

81
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,520
Dark. Empty.

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,940
Do you understand what he's talking about?

83
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,940
- No.
- [Mike] Guys, come on, think about it.

84
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,070
When El took us to find Will,
she took us to his house, right?

85
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,950
Yeah.
And he wasn't there.

86
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,740
But what if he was there?

87
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,780
What if we just couldn't see him?

88
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,830
What if he was on the other side?

89
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,080
What if this is Hawkins and...

90
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,750
this is where Will is?

91
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,460
The Upside Down.

92
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,250
Like the Vale of Shadows.

93
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,630
[Hopper] Will?

94
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,220
- Will?
- [alarm blaring faintly]

95
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,600
Will?

96
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,980
[alarm continues]

97
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,440
- [pressing button]
- [indistinct chatter]

98

[guards yelling]

99
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,280
I see him! Hey! Stop!

100
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,250
[Dustin] "The Vale of Shadows

101
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,590
is a dimension that is a dark reflection
or echo of our world.

102
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,640
<i>It is a place of decay and death."</i>

103
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,050
[Hopper] Will?

104
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,020
"A plane out of phase.
A place of monsters.

105
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,860
It is right next to you,
and you don't even see it."

106
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,320
- [electricity crackling]
- [Hopper coughing] Will?

107
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,490
Will?

108
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,570
An alternate dimension.

109
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,490
But... how... how do we get there?

110
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,620
You cast Shadow Walk.

111
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,990
In real life, dummy.

112
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,080
We can't shadow walk, but...

113
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,460
maybe she can.

114
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,920
Do you know how we get there?
To the Upside Down?

115
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,670
[sighing] Oh, my God!

116
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,310
[coughing]

117

[exclaims softly]

118
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,560
What the hell?

119
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,570
[rhythmic pulsing]

120
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,680
[gasps]

121
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,190
[Hopper] Hey!

122
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,280
Hey! Hey!

123
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,780
[theme music playing]

124
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,520
Hey, kid.

125
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,400
What's going on?

126
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,570
Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here tonight.
[stammers] On the couch.

127
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,730
[Lonnie] Yeah, I'm here
as long as you need me, okay?

128
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,580
How are you holding up?

129
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,330
What happened?

130
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,040
- Don't worry about that.
- Mom...

131
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,750
that thing you saw before,
did it come back?

132
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,550
Jonathan, that's enough.

133
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,340
[sighs]

134
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,050
Can we talk?

135
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,300
Alone?

136
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,350
- You need to leave.
- Look, I know you're upset.

137
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,010
We all are.

138
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,190
But you need to listen to me.
Your mother is sick. Really sick.

139
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,770
Yeah. Well, you being here,

140
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,126
you're just making things worse,
like always.

141
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,190
- Worse?
- Yeah!

142
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,230
She took down that wall with an ax.

143
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,466
She said that Will was inside
and that he's talking to her.

144
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,990
Yeah.
Maybe he was.

145
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,820
This isn't some kind of joke.

146
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,910
Your mom was half frozen to death
when I got here.

147
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,370
Trembling, scared out of her mind.

148
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,766
You come in here and you start
feeding into her hallucinations

149
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,016
or whatever the hell you want to call it,

150
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,720
you're gonna push her right over the edge.

151
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,000
You hear me?

152
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,380
[sighs] Look, I'm on your side.

153
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,760
I'm here to help.

154
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,696
I'm gonna make things better
around here for all of us.

155
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,430
[scoffs] Thank God you're here.

156
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,680
Do me a favor.
At the funeral tomorrow, just behave.

157
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,480
If not for me, for your mother.

158
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,940
Take that down.
It's inappropriate.

159
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,830
- Good.
- Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me.

160
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,620
Ah... there.
It's supposed to be a little tight.

161
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,790
Looks good.

162
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,250
- [zipper closing]
- Here we go. [sighs]

163
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,340
You look nice, sweetie.

164
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,680
Anything else?

165
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,640
You can borrow my black heels if you want.

166
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,560
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.

167
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,930
I'm fine. Thanks.

168
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,480
[whimpering]

169
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,630
Ugh.

170
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,230
Come on.
Time to go.

171
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,810
[groans softly]

172
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,940
- Come on.
- [sighs]

173
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,910
[Pastor Charles] <i>"Fear not,</i>
<i>for I am with you.</i>

174
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,660
<i>Be not dismayed, for I am your God.</i>

175
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,620
I will strengthen you.

176
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,870
Yes, I will help you.

177
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,630
I will uphold you
with my righteous right hand."

178
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,090
It's times like these
that our faith is challenged.

179
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,720
How, if He is truly benevolent...

180
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,050
could God take from us
someone so young, so innocent?

181
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,980
It would be easy to turn away from God...

182
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,310
but we must remember that nothing,

183
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,020
not even tragedy,
can separate us from His love.

184
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,110
We are here today to find comfort
in the truth of scripture,

185
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,440
- and to surround Will and his family...
- [sniffles]

186
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,860
Just wait till we tell Will that
Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.

187
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,240
[shushes]

188
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,090
- [Karen] I'm so, so sorry.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

189
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,260
Yeah, if there's anything we can do...

190
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,380
I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.

191
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,640
Take care, all right?
Thanks.

192
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,220
Thanks for coming out.

193
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,280
I see Will the Wise is back.

194
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,910
What's that shooting out of his cane?

195
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,410
Fireballs.

196
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,780
I couldn't find the red crayon,
so that's why it's green.

197
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,910
Oh, well...

198
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,040
if he's so wise,
why does he need fireballs?

199
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,330
Why can't he just, you know,
outsmart the bad guys?

200
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,050
Most of the time, yeah, totally.

201
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,420
But... sometimes the bad guys
are smart, too.

202
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:00,510
You know?

203
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,050
Yeah.

204
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,090
So he needs the fireballs?

205
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,970
Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.

206
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,480
All right. Well, I don't know
who's been raising you,

207
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,980
but I'm gonna get you some new crayons

208
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,980
because it looks like
he's shooting cabbages.

209
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,320
[both chuckle]

210
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,490
[gasping]

211
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,950
[breathing heavily]

212
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,090
[panting]

213
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,490
[dishes clattering]

214
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,630
[exclaims]

215
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,760
[Lucas] <i>Will! Will, it's us!</i>
<i>Are you there?</i>

216
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,276
[Dustin] <i>Can you hear us?</i>
<i>We're here!</i>

217
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,600
[Will distorted] <i>Hello? Mom?</i>

218
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,480
[Lucas] <i>Why can't he hear us?</i>
[Mike] <i>I don't know!</i>

219
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,890
[Will distorted] <i>Mom, it's coming!</i>

220
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,190
She was there.

221
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,980
[church bell tolling]

222
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,820
This is where we know
for sure it's been, right?

223
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,360
- So, that's...
- Steve's house.

224
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,990
And that's the woods
where they found Will's bike and...

225
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,160
that's my house.

226
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,120
- It's all so close.
- Yeah. Exactly.

227
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,580
I mean, it's all within a mile
or something.

228
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,960
Whatever this thing is, it's...
it's not traveling far.

229
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,960
You want to go out there.

230
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,840
We might not find anything.

231
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,260
I found something.

232
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,140
And if we do see it...

233
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,230
then what?

234
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,390
[sighs]

235
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,060
We kill it.

236
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,360
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a second.

237
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,540
Are you serious?

238
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,000
What? You want to find this thing
and take another photo? Yell at it?

239
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,250
This is a terrible idea.

240
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,880
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.

241
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,880
What? You can tell someone,
but they're not gonna believe you.

242
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,970
You know that.

243
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,300
Your mom would.

244
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,890
- She's been through enough.
- She deserves to know.

245
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,350
Yeah, and I'll tell her...

246
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,810
when this thing is dead.

247
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
I don't know what in the world caused it.

248
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,690
- Let's take a look, huh?
- Yeah.

249
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,450
Mr. Clarke says
he's never seen anything like it.

250
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,570
Mr. Clarke?

251
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,580
Yeah, he runs the AV Club.

252
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,780
[repairman] That right?

253
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,250
Apparently, some of the less
athletic types go nuts for this stuff.

254
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,550
[engine starting]

255
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,600
[indistinct chatter]

256
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,870
[Mike] Mr. Clarke?

257
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,580
Oh, hey, there.

258
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,790
How are you boys holding up?

259
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,500
[munching]

260
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,000
We're... in... mourning.

261
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,840
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.

262
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,210
[Mike] We were wondering
if you had time to talk?

263
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,470
- We have some questions.
- A lot of questions.

264
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,470
So, you know how in <i>Cosmos,</i>
Carl Sagan talks about other dimensions?

265
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,680
Like, beyond our world?

266
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,260
Yeah, sure. Theoretically.

267
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,430
Right, theoretically.

268
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,100
So, theoretically,
how do we travel there?

269
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,456
You guys have been thinking about

270
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,640
Hugh Everett's <i>Many-Worlds Interpretation,</i>
haven't you?

271
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,280
Well, basically,
there are parallel universes.

272
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,780
Just like our world,

273
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,320
but just infinite variations of it.

274
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,636
Which means there's a world out there

275
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,306
where none of this tragic stuff
ever happened.

276
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,490
Yeah, that's not what we're talking about.

277
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,120
- Oh.
- We were thinking of more

278
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,806
of an evil dimension,
like the Vale of Shadows.

279
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,370
You know the Vale of Shadows?

280
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,936
An echo of the Material Plane,
where necrotic and shadow magic...

281
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
[Mike] Yeah, exactly.

282
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,420
If that did exist,
a place like the Vale of Shadows,

283
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,840
how would we travel there?

284
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,800
- Theoretically.
- [Mr. Clarke] Well...

285
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,350
Picture... an acrobat...

286
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,810
standing on a tightrope.

287
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,520
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.

288
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,070
And our dimension has rules.

289
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,980
You can move forwards, or backwards.

290
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,070
But, what if...

291
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:59,280
right next to our acrobat,
there is a flea?

292
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,490
Now, the flea can also travel
back and forth, just like the acrobat.

293
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,870
- Right?
- Right.

294
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,250
Here's where things
get really interesting.

295
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,630
The flea can also travel this way...

296
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,840
along the side of the rope.

297
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,550
He can even go...

298
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,720
underneath the rope.

299
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,010
- [boys] Upside down.
- Exactly.

300
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,340
But we're not the flea,
we're the acrobat.

301
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:21,680
In this metaphor, yes,
we're the acrobat.

302
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,350
So we can't go upside down?

303
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,770
No.

304
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,600
Well, is there any way for the acrobat
to get to the Upside Down?

305
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,270
Well... you'd have to create
a massive amount of energy.

306
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,150
More than humans are currently
capable of creating, mind you,

307
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,530
to open up some kind of tear
in time and space,

308
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,820
and then...

309
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,080
you create a doorway.

310
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,830
- Like a gate?
- Sure. Like a gate.

311
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:50,710
- But again, this is all...
- Theoretical.

312
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,250
But... but what if this gate
already existed?

313
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,760
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.

314
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,130
It would disrupt gravity,

315
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,180
the magnetic field, our environment.

316
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,680
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.

317
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,470
Science is neat.

318
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,310
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.

319
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,950
Whoa.

320
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,530
Hey, Chief!

321
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,250
- [knocking] Hello? Whoa!
- Hey!

322
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,540
- [Powell] Jesus, Chief. You all right?
- What are you doing here?

323
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,300
- We tried calling, but...
- Yeah, the phone's dead.

324
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,800
Hey, so Bev Mooney came in
this morning all upset.

325
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,550
Said that Dale and Henry
went hunting yesterday...

326
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,736
and they didn't come back home.

327
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,230
She thought they were on another binger,
but she's not so sure now.

328
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,560
I think this whole Will Byers thing
has everybody on edge.

329
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,290
- Where was this?
- It was at the station.

330
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,270
No, no. Where did Henry
and Dale go hunting?

331
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,240
Oh. Uh, out near Kerley.

332
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,820
Mirkwood.

333
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,150
What?

334
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,990
Okay.

335
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,780
You go back to the station.
I'll take care of this, all right?

336
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,540
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, leave it.

337
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,080
- Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car.
- What?

338
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,090
Barbara Holland's car.
Seems she ran away after all.

339
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,710
Staties found it late last night
at a bus station.

340
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,840
Funny, right?
They keep doing our job for us.

341
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,720
Yeah.
[chuckles] It's funny.

342
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,890
[door closes]

343
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,850
- Is he off his meds again?
- [engine starts]

344
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,560
He's been spending too much time
with Joyce Byers.

345
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,900
That's what I think.

346
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,030
[sighs] What are you doing?

347
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,740
What does it look like I'm doing?

348
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,390
You want to freeze to death all winter?

349
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,370
[hammering continues]

350
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,580
- I told you not to take these down.
- They were in the way, babe.

351
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,040
How long are you gonna keep those up?
I mean, really?

352
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,390
You know, it's a shame
what they've done to this family.

353
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,260
- What?
- The Sattler Company.

354
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,060
I went to the quarry
on the way over here.

355
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,140
I just wanted to look around, you know?

356
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,730
Couldn't believe it.
I just couldn't believe it.

357
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,400
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.

358
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,530
Ought to be held accountable
if you ask me.

359
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,410
It would take a lot of energy
to build a gate like this.

360
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,636
But that's got to be what happened.

361
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,710
- Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right?
- Right.

362
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,670
What we want to know is,
do you know where the gate is?

363
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,500
Then how do you know
about the Upside Down?

364
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,550
[Mike] Dustin, what are you doing?
Dustin?

365
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,890
- Dustin!
- Dustin!

366
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,890
- I... I need to see your compasses.
- What?

367
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,270
Your compasses.
All of your compasses, right now!

368
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,360
What's exciting about this?

369
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,950
- Well, they're all facing north, right?
- Yeah, so?

370
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,966
- Well, that's not true north.
- What do you mean?

371
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,080
I mean exactly what I just said.
That's not true north.

372
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,500
Are you both seriously this dense?

373
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,710
The sun rises in the east,
and it sets in the west. Right?

374
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,170
Which means that's true north.

375
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,026
So what you're saying
is the compasses are broken.

376
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,510
[sighs] Do you even understand
how a compass works?

377
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,850
- Do you see a battery pack on this?
- No.

378
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,930
No, you don't.
Because it doesn't need one.

379
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,810
The needle's naturally drawn
to the Earth's magnetic North Pole.

380
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,310
So what's wrong with them?

381
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,456
Well, that's what I couldn't figure out,
but then I remembered.

382
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,586
You can change the direction
of a compass with a magnet.

383
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,980
If there's the presence
of a more powerful magnetic field,

384
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,780
the needle deflects to that power.

385
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,540
And then I remembered
what Mr. Clarke said.

386
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,280
The gate would have so much power...

387
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,006
It could disrupt
the electromagnetic field.

388
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,080
Exactly.

389
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,540
Meaning, if we follow
the compasses' north...

390
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,580
They should lead us to the gate.

391
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,780
[sighs]

392
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,140
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.

393
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,470
- [exhales] What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

394
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,140
- Nothing.
- I hope that's not meant for me.

395
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,600
What? No.

396
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,730
Oh, no, I was just...

397
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,570
- thinking about joining softball.
- Oh.

398
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,530
Well, uh...

399
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,940
listen, I'm really sorry.

400
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,780
I mean, even before you threatened me
with the baseball bat.

401
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,620
Okay.

402
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,200
I panicked and...

403
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,370
[sighs]

404
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,080
- I mean, I was a total dick.
- Yeah, you were.

405
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,580
[sighs]

406
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,800
Did you get in trouble with your parents?

407
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,130
Totally, but...

408
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,380
you know, who cares?
Screw 'em.

409
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,300
Any news about Barbara?

410
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,350
- Parents heard from her? Or...
- No.

411
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,520
Hey, listen.

412
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,600
Why don't we, uh, why don't we
catch a movie tonight, you know?

413
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,360
Just kinda pretend everything's normal
for a few hours.

414
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,230
<i>All The Right Moves</i> is still playing.

You aren't here 'cause of Will.
You never cared about him. You never did!

Maybe I'm out of my mind!

But, God help me, I will keep
these lights up until the day I die

- A rabbit?
- Yeah.

478
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,010
I guess he thought it would make me
into more of a man or something.

479
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,430
I cried for a week.

480
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,680
Jesus.

481
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,020
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.

482
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,390
[chuckles] I meant your dad.

483
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,690
Yeah.

484
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,730
I guess he and my mother
loved each other at some point, but...

485
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,400
[gun cocks]

486
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,150
...I wasn't around for that part.

487
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,700
Um, yeah.

488
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,240
Just, uh, point and shoot.

489
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,210
I don't think my parents
ever loved each other.

490
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,250
They must've married for some reason.

491
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,710
My mom was young.

492
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,170
My dad was older,

493
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:43,340
but he had a cushy job, money,
came from a good family.

494
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,720
So they bought a nice house
at the end of the cul-de-sac...

495
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,770
and started their nuclear family.

496
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,690
Screw that.

497
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,940
Yeah.

498
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,570
Screw that.

499
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:02,530
- [beer can clatters]
- [both chuckle]

500
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,780
[dialing]

501
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,620
[line ringing]

502
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,080
- [woman] <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey.

503
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,670
<i>Jim?</i>

504
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,500
- Yeah.
- [sighs]

505
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,250
<i>Why are you calling me here?
I told you not to call me.</i>

506
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,960
I know, I know, I know.
I just wanted to...

507
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,430
I just wanted to hear your voice
and, uh...

508
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,640
I just wanted to say that, um...

509
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,520
even after everything that happened,
I don't...

510
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,270
I don't regret any of it.

511
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,230
And those seven years, they were...
everything to me.

512
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,780
<i>Have you been drinking?</i>

513
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,570
No.

514
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,830
- No.
- [baby crying over phone]

515
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,040
[woman shushing] <i>Honey, hey...</i>

516
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,210
<i>Hey, it's okay...</i>
<i>it's okay.</i> [shushing]

517
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,540
[crying continues]

518
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,920
You know what, actually,
I have been drinking, I'm sorry.

519
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,380
<i>Jim, I can't...</i>

520
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,550
Just take care of yourself, okay?

521
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,010
Say hi to Bill for me.

522
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,380
<i>Are you sure...</i>

523
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,150
[phone ringing]

524
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,530
[ringing stops]

525
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:34,250
[sighs] How much further?

526
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,420
I don't know.
These only tell direction, not distance.

527
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,710
You really need to learn more
about compasses.

528
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,250
I'm just saying.

529
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,760
How do we know
when we get to the gate?

530
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,510
Uh, I think a portal to another dimension
is gonna be pretty obvious.

531
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,720
[sighs]

532
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,020
Do you think she's acting weird?

533
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,690
You're asking if the weirdo
is acting weird?

534
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,900
I mean, weirder than normal?

535
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,610
I don't know.
Who cares?

536
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,620
[breathing heavily]

537
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,910
How far, Papa?

538
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,250
Farther than we've ever gone before.

539
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,630
- The bath?
- Yes.

540
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,260
Yes, the bath.

541
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,050
Is that okay?

542
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,350
Okay.

543
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,570
Mike.

544
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,030
Yeah?

545
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,650
Turn back.

546
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,280
What? Why?

547
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,450
I'm tired.

548
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:18,330
[sighs] Look, I'm sure we're almost there.
Just hold on a little longer, okay?

549
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,590
[sighs]

550
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,140
[Nancy] You never said what I was saying.

551
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,600
[Jonathan] What?

552
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,810
[Nancy] Yesterday.

553
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,440
You said I was saying something
and that's why you took my picture.

554
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,690
Oh, uh...

555
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,860
I don't know.

556
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,530
My guess...

557
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:58,740
I saw this girl, you know,
trying to be someone else.

558
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,290
But for that moment...

559
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,830
it was like you were alone,
or you thought you were.

560
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,290
And, you know,
you could just be yourself.

561
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,090
That is such bullshit.

562
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,550
[stammers] What?

563
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:17,260
I am not trying to be someone else.

564
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,850
Just because I'm dating Steve
and you don't like him...

565
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,560
You know what? Forget it.
I just thought it was a good picture.

566
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
He's actually a good guy.

567
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,810
[stammers] Okay.

568
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,190
Yesterday, with the camera...

569
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,320
He's not like that at all.

570
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,690
He was just being protective.

571
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,610
Yeah, that's one word for it.

572
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,530
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay?

573
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,120
No, I... I never said that.

574
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,466
He had every right to be pissed...

575
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,540
Okay, all right.
Does that mean I have to like him?

576
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,040
No.

577
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,210
Listen, don't take it so personally, okay?

578
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,170
I don't like most people.
He's in the vast majority.

579
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,260
You know, I was actually starting
to think that you were okay.

580
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,180
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

581
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,350
Yeah, I was thinking,
"Jonathan Byers,

582
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:04,640
maybe he's not the pretentious creep
everyone says he is."

583
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,730
Well, I was just starting
to think you were okay.

584
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,690
- Oh.
- I was thinking, "Nancy Wheeler,

585
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,690
she's not just another suburban girl
who thinks she's rebelling

586
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,690
by doing exactly what
every other suburban girl does...

587
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,400
until that phase passes
and they marry some boring one-time jock

588
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,650
who now works sales,

589
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,636
and they live out a perfectly boring
little life at the end of a cul-de-sac.

590
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,990
Exactly like their parents,
who they thought were so depressing,

591
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,080
but now, hey, they get it."

592
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,660
[scoffs]

593
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,630
[scoffs]

594
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,510
[pounding on door]

595
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,300
Go away, Lonnie.

596
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,550
[continues pounding]

597
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,300
Seriously!

598
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,220
I am gonna murd...

599
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,100
[whispers] What? What?

600
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,240
[Hopper sighs]

601
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,280
Oh, Jesus.

602
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,910
[scoffs]

603
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,800
Oh, no.

604
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,680
"Oh, no"?
What's, "Oh, no"?

605
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,220
- We're headed back home.
- What?

606
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,580
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

607
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,970
Setting sun, right there.
We looped right back around.

608
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,600
And you're just realizing this now?

609
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,600
- Why is this all on me?
- Because you're the compass genius!

610
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,190
What do yours say?

611
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,820
[both] North.

612
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,360
- [Lucas sighs]
- Makes no damn sense.

613
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,400
[sighs] Maybe the gate moved.

614
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,360
No, I don't think it's the gate.

615
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,280
I think it's something else
screwing with the compasses.

616
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,120
Maybe it's something here.

617
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,620
No, it has to be like a super magnet.

618
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,370
It's not a magnet.

619
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,370
She's been acting weirder than normal.

620
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,356
If she can slam doors with her mind,
she can definitely screw up a compass.

621
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,420
Why would she do that?

622
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,460
Because she's trying
to sabotage our mission.

623
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,880
Because she's a traitor!

624
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,930
[Mike] Lucas, what are you doing?

625
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,850
You did it, didn't you?

626
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,720
You don't want us to reach the gate.

627
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,640
You don't want us to find Will.

628
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,916
[Mike] Lucas, come on, seriously,

629
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,166
- just leave her alone!
- Admit it.

630
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,810
- No.
- Admit it!

631
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,990
- Fresh blood. I knew it.
- Lucas, come on!

632
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,150
I saw her wiping her nose on the tracks!
She was using her powers!

633
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,030
Bull! That's old blood.
Right, El?

634
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,200
Right, El?

635
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,870
[crying] It's... not...

636
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,500
it's not safe.

637
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,590
- [Hopper panting]
- [light bulbs clattering]

638
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,060
[panting] Okay.

639
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,730
Should be okay, I mean...

640
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,820
I can't guarantee it,
but it should be okay.

641
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,570
What the hell is going on, Hopper?

642
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,870
They bugged my place.

643
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,280
- What?
- They bugged my place.

644
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,830
They put a microphone in the light.

645
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,460
[sighs]

646
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,170
It's because I'm on to them
and they know it.

647
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,960
- I don't know...
- Who?

648
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,476
I thought they might be watching you, too.

649
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,760
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA,
Department of Energy... I don't know.

650
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,010
You gotta explain this to me,
'cause I am not...

651
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,140
I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.

652
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,600
What?

653
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,600
It wasn't him.

654
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,520
What?

655
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,730
Will's body, it was a fake.

656
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,320
[Joyce exclaims]

657
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,400
You were right.

658
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,080
This whole time, you were right.

659
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,210
What did I tell you?
She's been playing us from the beginning!

660
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,500
That's not true.
She helped us find Will!

661
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,590
Find Will?

662
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,920
Find Will?

663
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,380
Where is he, then? Huh?
I don't see him.

664
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:10,140
- Yeah, you know what I mean.
- No, I actually don't.

665
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,470
Just think about it, Mike.

666
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,220
She could've just told us where
the Upside Down was right away,

667
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,390
but she didn't.

668
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,470
She just made us
run around like headless chickens.

669
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,140
- All right, calm down!
- No!

670
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,020
She used us, all of us!

671
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,480
She helped just enough
so she could get what she wants.

672
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,780
Food and a bed.

673
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,070
- She's like a stray dog.
- Screw you, Lucas!

674
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,150
No! Screw you, Mike.
You're blind...

675
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,596
blind because you like
that a girl's not grossed out by you.

676
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,080
But wake up, man!
Wake the hell up!

677
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,200
She knows where Will is,

678
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,080
and now she's just letting him die
in the Upside Down.

679
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,630
- Shut up!
- For all we know, it's her fault.

680
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,750
Shut up.

681
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,300
We're looking for some stupid monster...

682
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,590
but did you ever stop to think
that maybe she's the monster?

683
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,010
I said shut up!

00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,510

- [Dustin] Knock it off, you idiots.

00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,996
- Stop it!
- [Dustin] Mike, get off!

Lucas, are you all right?

691
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,160
- Lucas.
- Lucas, come on!

692
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,320
- Lucas, wake up! Lucas.
- [Dustin] Come on, Lucas!

693
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,080
Why would you do that?

694
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,880
- [Dustin] Come on.
- What's wrong with you?

695
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,830
[distorted] What is wrong with you?

how many fingers am I holding up?

Lucas, how many fingers?

- [Mike] Let me see your head.
- Get off of me!

[Mike] Just... Lucas.
Lucas, let me see.
