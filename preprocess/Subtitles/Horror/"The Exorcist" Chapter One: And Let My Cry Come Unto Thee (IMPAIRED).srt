00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,341
and all of the chairs have
been moved away from the table.

338
00:18:45,413 --> 00:18:48,411
Or the bookshelves.

339
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:51,062
All of the books are on the floor.

340
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:53,829
- Well, maybe Henry's...
- It's not Henry.

341
00:18:54,653 --> 00:18:58,607
There are voices inside the walls.

342
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:03,493
Well, you know, I have this fan back home.

343
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:05,562
And sometimes, in the middle of the night,

344
00:19:05,597 --> 00:19:07,577
starts to make this strange sound.

345
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:09,873
Like, uh, chaka, chaka,
chaka, chaka, chaka...

346
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,998
There is something inside my house.

347
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:16,606
- Angela, I'm...
- And I know how this sounds,

348
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:20,448
but I have 400 employees under me.

349
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:23,125
- I'm not a crazy person.
- No, I'm-I'm not saying you're crazy.

350
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:23,929
I'm...

351
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:25,467
It's a demon.

352
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:32,293
A demon?

353
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:34,856
And it's trying to take my daughter.

354
00:19:38,163 --> 00:19:41,910
Angela, demons, um, aren't real.

355
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:44,541
They are an invention

356
00:19:44,576 --> 00:19:48,187
of the Church to explain things like, um,

357
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:50,173
addiction,

358
00:19:50,263 --> 00:19:52,353
mental illness.

359
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:56,272
They were not monsters or creatures.

360
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:00,076
Demons are...

361
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:01,781
metaphors.

362
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:04,303
Do you think I don't know that?

363
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:08,416
Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is

364
00:20:08,465 --> 00:20:11,315
to sit here and sound like this?

365
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:16,582
But I am telling you,
something is going on.

366
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:21,772
There is a presence, and I feel it.

367
00:20:22,827 --> 00:20:25,975
I'm not even trying to
convince you to believe me.

368
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,646
Just come to the house.

369
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:31,885
Just talk to her.

370
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:33,583
Will you?

371
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:35,385
(sighs)

372
00:20:35,786 --> 00:20:36,918
Yes.

373
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:40,399
- (screams) Oh! Oh, my God!
- (raven screeching)

374
00:20:40,434 --> 00:20:43,001
Oh! Oh, my God!

375
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:46,863
(screeching)

376
00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:49,032
(panting)

377
00:21:37,024 --> 00:21:39,157
(train brakes squealing)

378
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:44,195
(doors hiss open)

379
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:54,546
KAT: Clearly, my mom put you up to this.

380
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:56,627
You can just go ahead
and tell her I'm fine.

381
00:21:56,662 --> 00:22:00,453
I'm wildly aware of the
fact that everyone thinks

382
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:03,862
I'm this fragile little
ornament, but I'm fine.

383
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:05,043
I'm dealing.

384
00:22:05,122 --> 00:22:06,842
And how are you sleeping?

385
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:07,824
What?

386
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:09,911
Any bad dreams?

387
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:11,456
- I don't dream.
- Not ever?

388
00:22:11,491 --> 00:22:13,258
No. What is this about?

389
00:22:15,495 --> 00:22:17,595
(sighs)

390
00:22:19,517 --> 00:22:23,177
Your mother believes that your
house has been visited by, um...

391
00:22:23,243 --> 00:22:24,686
a presence.

392
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,677
A demon.

393
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:29,931
(laughing)

394
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,541
Oh, my God. (exhales)

395
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,749
That's hysterical.

396
00:22:39,886 --> 00:22:41,519
(exhales)

397
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,173
You know

398
00:22:44,253 --> 00:22:46,353
what's going on here, right?

399
00:22:49,171 --> 00:22:53,903
I liked my friend's stupid
Wiccan craft store on Facebook.

400
00:22:53,938 --> 00:22:57,383
So now she thinks I'm out
drinking ram's blood or something.

401
00:22:58,205 --> 00:23:00,572
Do you know how embarrassing that is?

402
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:03,494
- She's very worried about you.
- She's losing her mind.

403
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:05,393
You've seen my dad and what he's like?

404
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,644
Yes.

405
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,447
Last Christmas,

406
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:12,083
they were taking ballroom
dancing classes together.

407
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:14,696
Now she's got to check his ass

408
00:23:14,785 --> 00:23:17,050
every time he goes to the bathroom.

409
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:19,591
(sighs)

410
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:21,092
Her whole life blew up,

411
00:23:21,128 --> 00:23:23,655
and she's looking for somebody to blame.

412
00:23:24,922 --> 00:23:26,377
Besides God.

413
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,885
Is that who you blame when things go wrong?

414
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:31,213
No.

415
00:23:32,072 --> 00:23:34,137
I blame myself.

416
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:37,909
Because that's what you
do when you're an adult.

417
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,612
Angela, thank you very, very much.

418
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:48,486
Thank you. This is... It's great.

419
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:51,022
No, it's just boring old meatloaf.

420
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:53,725
Haven't made a meal in months.

421
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,933
It's really good, Mom.

422
00:23:54,988 --> 00:23:57,458
ANGELA: Well, I kind of burnt the edges.

423
00:23:57,493 --> 00:24:00,098
- Rusty.
- I like burnt edges.

424
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,330
A little gristle for the gums.

425
00:24:03,461 --> 00:24:05,172
How's the boat, Henry?

426
00:24:10,745 --> 00:24:11,876
How's that?

427
00:24:12,945 --> 00:24:15,178
The boat... did you fix it up?

428
00:24:19,473 --> 00:24:21,221
He's talking about your boat, Henry.

429
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:22,917
You're wasting your time.

430
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,201
- He's basically a potato.
- Kat!

431
00:24:28,015 --> 00:24:28,775
Should we get dessert?

432
00:24:28,816 --> 00:24:31,054
Katherine, what is wrong with you?

433
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:33,295
- That's your father.
- Really?

434
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,775
Does that look like Dad to you?

435
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,501
Dad? Dad?!

436
00:24:36,598 --> 00:24:38,704
- Hello? Dad?
- Katherine!

437
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:53,292
TOMAS: You know, I had an
advisor back in seminary.

438
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:57,309
He was... called in to
give the last rites...

439
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,984
(clears throat)

440
00:24:58,028 --> 00:25:00,395
...to a young woman in a coma.

441
00:25:00,493 --> 00:25:03,161
She was brain-dead.

442
00:25:03,486 --> 00:25:05,250
No hope of recovery.

443
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:09,155
So, he goes there, he does his thing,

444
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:11,327
but the next day, she wakes up.

445
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:13,857
It was a miracle.

446
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:16,361
That's wonderful.

447
00:25:16,396 --> 00:25:17,876
But here's the thing.

448
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:19,344
That woman

449
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:22,163
could remember conversations
that took place inside her room

450
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,167
while she was in her coma,
which suggests... I don't know...

451
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:29,159
to me, anyway, that even when
the rest of the body shuts down,

452
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:32,757
there is some part of the
brain that stays aware,

453
00:25:33,002 --> 00:25:35,069
knows everything that's going on.

454
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:41,117
So keep your damn hands out of his face.

455
00:25:52,646 --> 00:25:53,611
(door slams)

456
00:25:53,647 --> 00:25:55,494
(man laughs over TV)

457
00:25:55,536 --> 00:25:57,850
MAN: Nice tarpon, Austin!

458
00:25:57,885 --> 00:25:59,551
- MAN 2: Good job.
- MAN: Sweet!

459
00:25:59,586 --> 00:26:01,671
AUSTIN: I don't want to let go!

460
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:02,808
MAN 2: It's done.

461
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:05,147
Hey, Henry,

462
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:06,668
I am taking off.

463
00:26:06,703 --> 00:26:09,013
- Hey, thanks for coming.
- Oh, it's...

464
00:26:09,966 --> 00:26:11,881
And thanks for talking to Kat.

465
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:15,229
I know Angela's been...

466
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:16,080
Yeah.

467
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:18,065
It's been a rough couple of months.

468
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:20,104
She's a good kid.

469
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,063
Yeah. She is.

470
00:26:22,976 --> 00:26:24,244
Thank you.

471
00:26:24,978 --> 00:26:27,078
(footsteps departing)

472
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:29,652
It's just off 41.

473
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,518
What's off 41?

474
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:36,517
St. Aquinas.

475
00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:38,656
(chuckles)

476
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,655
What's at St. Aquinas?

477
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:43,215
Father Marcus.

478
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:53,325
Father Marcus?

479
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,619
Henry...

480
00:27:01,691 --> 00:27:03,824
...who is Father Marcus?

481
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:11,199
Hey, thanks for coming.

482
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:14,080
And thanks for talking to Kat.

by the coming of our Lord for judgment,

504
00:28:41,438 --> 00:28:45,226
that you tell me by some sign your name,

505
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,919
- and the day and hour of your departure!
- (demonic voice babbling)

The hour of your departure!

And Jesus said...

512
00:29:16,832 --> 00:29:18,924
"Come to me,

513
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:22,174

Mexico City.

coincidence, Tomas.

647

God, for future reference, isn't
the one who works in mysterious ways.

648
00:36:45,968 --> 00:36:47,797
You're being manipulated, my friend,

649
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:52,099
by forces you can't
even begin to understand.

650
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:57,286
- They're gonna love you.
- They? Who are they?

651
00:36:57,351 --> 00:36:58,810
It's an excellent question.

652

(door creaks)

653
00:37:01,048 --> 00:37:02,836
Go home, Father Tomas.

654
00:37:02,871 --> 00:37:05,102
Give your homilies, break your bread.

655
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:06,657
Live a long and happy life.

656
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:08,606
You're way out of your depth.

657

You're afraid.

658
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,634
Yeah. You should be, too.

659
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,736
And Jesus said,

660
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:27,156
"Come to me, all you who
are weary and burdened,

661

Do you believe in God, Angela?

Wow.

677
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:50,612
Get right to the good stuff.

678
00:38:53,226 --> 00:38:57,494
Um... I like the idea of God.

679
00:38:58,366 --> 00:38:59,999
Um, I want to believe

680
00:39:00,034 --> 00:39:03,585
that good things happen for a reason,

681
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,487
and that we're not just a...

682

bunch of molecules
smashing into each other.

683

Hmm.

What about you?

686
00:39:17,907 --> 00:39:20,506
Well, if you talk to other priests...

687
00:39:22,588 --> 00:39:24,543
...they will tell you
they heard God's voice,

688
00:39:24,578 --> 00:39:29,025
His... actual voice, calling them to serve.

689
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:31,826
I never had that.

690
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:36,288
Did you know I was born in Chicago?

691
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:40,289
Mm. Right down the street.

692
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:42,025
I did not know that.

693
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,482
When my parents separated,
Olivia, my sister...

694
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:51,047
she stayed here, and I went to... to Mexico

695
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,237
to live with my grandmother.

696
00:39:54,498 --> 00:39:56,987
She would tell me all the
big plans she had for me.

697
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:58,611
She would say...

698
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:02,626
"You watch, <i>mijo.</i>

699
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:06,630
"You watch, and someday you'll
become the first Mexican pope."

702
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,112
Mm.

703
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:13,900
It always used to bother me
that I never heard God's voice.

704
00:40:13,947 --> 00:40:15,279
I would say,

705
00:40:15,348 --> 00:40:17,198
maybe He never wanted
me in the first place.

706
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,633
Maybe...

707
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:24,203
Maybe I don't belong here.

708
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:33,689
I think God spoke to me today.

709
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:36,232
What did He say?

710
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:38,776
He said...

711
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:43,668
"I want you to look at this family."
