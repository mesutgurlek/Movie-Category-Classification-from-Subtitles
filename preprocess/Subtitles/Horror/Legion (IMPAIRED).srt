1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,200
When I was a little girl,
my mother would remind me

2
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:41,000
each night before bed to
open up my heart to God,

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,400
for he was kind,
merciful and just.

4
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,700
Things changed when my
father left a few years later,

5
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,100
leaving her to raise me
and my brothers in a place

6
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,500
on the edge of the
Mojave Desert.

7
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,100
She never talked of a
kind, merciful God again.

8
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,000
Instead she spoke
of a prophecy.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
Of a time when all the world
would be covered in darkness

10
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,500
and the fate of Mankind
would be decided.

11
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,900
One night I finally got up
the courage to ask my mother

12
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,800
why God had changed, why
he was so mad at his children.

13
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:17,300
"I don't know," she said,
tucking the covers around me,

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,400
"I guess he just got tired
of all the bullshit."

15
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,200
God damn animals. Nights
like this I'd like to take

16
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,000
a match to this city so
I could watch all these

17
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,600
motherfuckers burn.

18
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,100
Just a good old' boy
barbecue, eh?

19
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,100
A fresh start. That’s what
this place needs.

20
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,100
Pow!

21
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,100
Pow!

22
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,800
Pow!

23
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,700
Jesus...

24
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,300
Fuck!

25
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,900
Stop! , Drop the bags! Put your
hands on your head!

26
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,400
It’s starting.

27
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,900
There isn’t much time.

28
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Shut the fuck up and
drop the bags now!

29
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,300
Hands on your head!
On your head!

30
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,500
Turn around! Turn
the fuck around!

31
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,300
Let him go!

32
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,400
Let him fuck...

33
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,700
What then...?

34
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,000
Burton!

35
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,700
What are you doing, Michael?
These weren't your orders.

36
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,900
What did you say?

37
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,500
No, I'm following my
own orders now.

38
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,600
Then you will die
along with the child.

39
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,900
Burton, you fucking
know this guy?

40
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,200
What the hell is...?

41
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,000
"Paradise Falls"

42
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,500
You okay, Jeep?

43
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,500
- Sorry I woke you, Charlie.
- Yeah. Wasn't you.

44
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,600
He's been kicking up
a storm all night.

45
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,700
Must know
something I don't.

46
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,600
Another bad dream?

47
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,500
It's just stress, Jeep,
that's all.

48
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,000
You do too much
worrying.

49
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,000
About this place.
About your dad.

50
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,400
About me.

51
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,900
You're the only thing I
like to worry about.

52
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,500
See what I mean?

53
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,500
You're worried about a girl
that's eight months pregnant

54
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,400
and it isn't your baby.

55
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,200
It's enough to give
anybody nightmares.

56
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,700
Go ahead and make
fun of me , Everybody else does.

57
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,900
Come on.

58
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,400
You know how much I appreciate
everything that you and Bob are doing for me.

59
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,400
But a month from now, the
baby will have a new family...

60
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,300
I need to start to think about what the hell
I'm going to do with my life.

61
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,200
You're still going
through with it?

62
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,600
I'm not ready to
be a mother.

63
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,000
Christ, I can barely take
care of myself as it is.

64
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:16,100
I could help you , I mean
We could do it together , I want to.

65
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,200
You got to stop carrying the weight of
the world on your shoulders, Jeep.

66
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,300
<I>I don't know whether
I like it very much being

67
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,700
<I>seen around with an
angel without any wings.

68
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,500
<I>I've got to earn them and
you'll help me, won't you?

69
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,700
Lord as my witness, Bob, one of these days
that thing's going to hit you back.

70
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
What are you talking
about, Percy?

71
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
We got a special
relationship here.

72
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,400
Yeah, they got names for
that kind of relationship.

73
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,800
<I>But lonely walls,
I'll keep you company.

74
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,300
It's disgusting.

75
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,500
You're right.
It is disgusting.

76
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,400
Really. How can she go out
in public looking like that?

77
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,200
I don't know. Why
don't we just ask her?

78
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,400
Howard, Don't.
You'll embarrass me.

79
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,800
Audrey, honey? Your mother was wondering
if you got dressed this morning...

80
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:01,000
with the specific intention of showing
your ass off to the entire world?

81
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,900
It's because I woke up
hoping to get double teamed...

82
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,700
by a couple of meth head truckers in
some bathroom of a desert shithole.

83
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,100
It's good thing that we
got stuck here.

84
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,500
I feel satisfied with that
answer. I really do.

85
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,700
I'm being punished for
something, I know it.

86
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Shit.

87
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,200
Next service in 50 miles.

88
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,500
50 miles?

89
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,000
- Merry Christmas.
- What's so merry about it?

90
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You know that shit isn't
good for the baby.

91
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,100
Guess I should think
about quitting, then.

92
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,000
Before you quit,
can I get one from you?

93
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,100
You can buy a
whole pack inside.

94
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,700
How about I get one
from you and I give you

95
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,200
two from the pack
you're going to sell me?

96
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,900
You know what ?
I'm kind of lost.

97
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,100
Am I right here?

98
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,600
Not even close.

99
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:55,600
Son of a bitch! , Are there any
phone around here that actually work?

100
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,200
Bob will probably let you
use the diner phone....

101
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,800
if you ask him nice. Maybe
pay him a little something.

102
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,800
I think I can handle that.

103
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,400
You got anything in there
to eat? Pancakes, or...

104
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,600
Yup. We got a buttermilk
stack for three seventy-five,

105
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,800
French toast for four
dollars if you're into that.

106
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,300
Personally I like the
pancakes though.

107
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,500
- You okay, Charlie?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

108
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,400
This guy is just lost.

109
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,700
Who is that?

110
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,700
What do you want
me to do?

111
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,100
Talk to him! things should have been
ready two hours ago.

112
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,400
I hope Salem Lights are
all right, that's all we got left.

113
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Charlie, where have you been?

114
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,600
It's not a resort, we've
got orders stacking up.

115
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,900
You best not be smoking again.
Not in your condition.

116
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,000
Bob, see where
I'm at right now?

117
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,500
Can my condition really
get any worse?

118
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,800
- Besides, you isn’t one to talk.
- What? I quit two years ago.

119
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,800
Yeah? So why are you
still carrying that fancy lighter around?

120
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,600
Gift from my ex-wife.
I'm sentimental.

121
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,700
For when I remember how
much I hate her guts.

122
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,700
Hey, man, you got a
phone I can use?

123
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,800
My cell phone has no reception,
and the phone booth outside is busted.

124
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,900
Excuse me, is there any
news about when our....

125
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,800
car might be fixed?
You said your boy

126
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,200
would have us back on
the road two hours ago.

127
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,900
I got to say the rate we're going, we'll
be lucky to make it to Scottsdale by Christmas.

128
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,500
Hey. Hood's up on this car.
That mean anything to you?

129
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,100
Yeah.

130
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,600
What the hell are you
working on that's so

131
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,600
damn important you're
not doing your job.

132
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,600
Found it under a bunch of
stuff in the storage shed.

133
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,900
I know you never liked
throwing anything away

134
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,400
- What are you doing?
- What?

135
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:29,300
Jeep, I like Charlie, I do and I think
it's nice of you to give her help ...

136
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,600
- Leave me alone.
- ... but it's not your responsibility.

137
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,600
Don't you walk away from while I'm
talking to you.

138
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:40,000
How long you going to follow her
around like a puppy dog?

139
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,900
Cleaning up the messes she makes while
she steps out with every guy but you?

140
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,100
Don't say that about her!
She's not like that.

141
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,800
Look.

142
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,800
I know it doesn't make
much sense to you.

143
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,900
Sometimes it doesn't make
sense to me either.

144
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I've been having these
dreams about her.

145
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,600
Some of them so bad...

146
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,300
I wish I'd never have
to sleep again.

147
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,300
I can't explain it, dad.

148
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,600
I just feel like it's
something I got to do.

149
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,600
You know your mother
thought I was crazy.

150
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,500
For wanting to buy this place, It's all the way
up here, in the middle of nowhere...

151
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,600
But I just knew it was
something I had to do.

152
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,900
I couldn't explain it
either. Just like you.

153
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,200
I told your mother:
"Trust me"

154
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,100
"You just wait and see,
when they build that mall,

155
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,800
with all the superstores
like they've been planning

156
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,200
on for years, this place
is going to be a goldmine."

157
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,000
Only problem was:
I was wrong.

158
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,500
They went and built the
thing in another county

159
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,700
and I looked pretty
damn stupid.

160
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,900
And I see you making
the same damn mistake I made.

161
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,100
Believing in something that's
never going to happen.

162
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,900
You listen to me, son. It's
time for you to leave here.

163
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,500
I don't want to see you
wake up one day

164
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,200
old and pissed off,
realizing you're lost,

165
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,400
Just like everybody else
who stops here.

166
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,800
Go on. Fix the car.

167
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,400
I want these people out
of here by nightfall.

168
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,400
He's about this close
to wrapping it up.

169
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
What is wrong with
you today?

170
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,600
I told you to get the satellite TV.
But you didn't want to listen.

171
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,900
What the hell do I
need that crap for?

172
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,600
The History Channel, man.

173
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,100
I got all the history
I can take.

174
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,600
- That's for sure.
- What's your beef now?

175
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
You don’t need to be
watching this anyway.

176
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,700
Alright baby. This is
going to be it, right here.

177
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
Clear as day.

178
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What the hell is that?

179
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,700
Well, they're testing
something.

180
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,400
That doesn't look
like a test.

181
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,800
Can I just use the phone?

182
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,200
It's back past
the kitchen.

183
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,600
Excuse me, but if this
were an actual emergency,

184
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,900
wouldn't they be giving us
instructions on what to do?

185
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,700
Percy, check out that
old radio of yours,

186
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,600
See if there's any
news about the TV.

187
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,600
Put my little man on the phone.

188
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,400
Because a father is supposed to be able
to talk to his son, that’s why.

189
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,100
I don't care what your lawyer said, I got my
own lawyer, now put him on the god damn phone.

190
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,800
Hello?

191
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,100
Your phone is breaking
up, do you hear me?

192
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,300
Shit.

193
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,200
Maybe there was
an earthquake.

194
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,800
A lot of people
could be hurt.

195
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,500
Not if it was cantered
in the desert.

196
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,500
Yeah, could be nothing
to worry about.

197
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,600
- So why is the TV out?
- Maybe it was terrorists.

198
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,500
Oh God.

199
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,800
For crying out loud, there's
no use speculating.

200
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,200
I'll just call my brother
up in Needles,

201
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,300
he'll probably
know something.

202
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,400
- I don't think so.
- What do you mean?

203
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,400
I was just on the phone, the shit cut off
in the middle of my conversation.

204
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,400
I want my money back.

205
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,800
This is perfect,
absolutely perfect.

206
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,000
Hey hey, everybody, Simmer down.
There's nothing to get excited about.

207
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,000
they're probably just
working on the lines.

208
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,800
Besides, Jeep's going to have
your car fixed in a jiffy,

209
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,000
then you can be on
your way, so...

210
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,000
Good.

211
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,500
Have a seat wherever you want ma'am.
Specials are on the board.

212
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
- I already know what I want.
- Okay. What will it be?

213
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,700
- I'll have a steak, please.
- How would you like that cooked?

214
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,100
Rare, if you would.
And water, no ice.

215
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,700
- Coming right up.
- Charlie, is it?

216
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,300
- Yeah
- Unusual name for a girl.

217
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,400
So they say. I'll be right
back with your water.

218
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,700
Hello, I'm Gladys.
Gladys Foster.

219
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,600
Oh, hello Gladys, it's
so nice to meet you.

220
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,900
I'm Sandra. And this is
my husband, Howard.

221
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,000
What a nice looking
young couple.

222
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What brings you up
to these parts?

223
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,300
We're on our way to
Scottsdale, but our car

224
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,300
broke down and we're
stuck here until it's fixed.

225
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,300
What a nuisance.

226
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,300
Gladys, the lines seem to
be down around here,

227
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,800
the phone and the TV and
I was just wondering

228
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,800
if you might have heard
something on your way up,

229
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,000
about what's going on?

230
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,500
Oh, you don't have to worry
about that, sweetheart, It'll all be over soon.

231
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,900
- So what are we looking at?
- I don't know.

232
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,300
It's probably something
wrong with the computer,

233
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,500
but we don't have the
gear to test it here.

234
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,400
Oh, shit.

235
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,600
They're going to be pissed.

236
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,500
Just tell them we'll
call it in and tow it.

237
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,800
That's not going to happen.
The phone's out.

238
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,500
- What?
- Yeah.

239
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,400
Thank you, dear. How
far along are you?

240
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,600
Oh, just about there.

241
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,900
The father must be
very proud.

242
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I wouldn't know. He's
out of sight, out of mind.

243
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,000
I see.

244
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,800
So I take it you're
not married?

245
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,700
- No.
- That's too bad.

246
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,000
No, I prefer it that way.

247
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,900
I don't need a man telling
me what to do.

248
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,200
- But what about the baby?
- I've got it under control.

249
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,700
But it's going to burn.

250
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,500
What did you just say?

251
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,100
I said your fucking
baby's going to burn.

252
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,400
Go to hell, lady.

253
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,600
- Fucking Jesus freak.
- What happened?

254
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,500
All little babies
are going to burn.

255
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,000
Gladys...

256
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,300
Shut up you stupid
fucking cunt. All you do is

257
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,600
- complain, complain, complain!
- What?

258
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,000
- What? What?
- Harold, no...

259
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,400
I don't know who the
hell you think you are,

260
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,700
but I'd like you to
apologize to my...

261
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,400
You're all going to
fucking die!

262
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,300
What the fuck, man?

263
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,700
Shoot her, Jeep!

264
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,000
You will never save her.

265
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,400
Shoot that bitch!

266
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,000
Shoot her!

267
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,000
Somebody help me!

268
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,800
Put pressure on him, don't look at
me like that , stop the bleeding

269
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,600
Calm down. Keep
pressure on his neck.

270
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,100
Easy.

271
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,500
How far is it to
the hospital?

272
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,500
Who the hell would do that?

273
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,800
I don't know.
I don't know.

274
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:11,900
70, maybe 80 miles.

275
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,800
80 miles? I'll get there as soon as
I can but I can't steer.

276
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,600
- Please drive faster.
- Okay.

277
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,300
What the hell is that?

278
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
It's clouds, what do
you think they are?

279
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,300
Clouds don't buzz!

280
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,300
I can't believe she was
still standing after Percy

281
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,900
hit her with that
frying pan.

282
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,400
He broke her fucking
neck, I saw it, I swear.

283
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,900
Did you see the gun
that guy had?

284
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,000
What's a guy doing
with a gun like that?

285
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,700
Hey, Jeep.
It's alright, son.

286
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,600
I couldn't pull the
trigger. I froze.

287
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:28,800
I saw what I needed
to do. But I was too afraid.

288
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,800
She would've killed you.
She would've killed Charlie.

289
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,500
Hey. You isn’t got nothing
to be ashamed of , You hear me, son?

290
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,600
Not everybody can
play the hero.

291
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,300
Especially when it comes
to pulling the trigger.

292
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,700
What happened?
What's going on?

293
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,700
- Gonne get my Bible!
- What for?

294
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,000
Somebody's got to
start praying.

295
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,300
Jesus, she's burning up.

296
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,100
How is that possible? She's
been dead for an hour.

297
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,800
I don't care how long
she's been dead.

298
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,900
The bitch just walked
on the ceiling.

299
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,700
She isn’t staying in here.

300
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,200
The old bitch is heavy.
Hold her up.

301
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,400
- Where are the flies?
- How am I supposed to know?

302
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
Are you asking me to
explain the behaviour of a

303
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
motherfucking pestilence?

304
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,900
Hey. Somebody's coming.

305
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,400
Now what?

306
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,700
- Alright. Now we're talking.
- Wait a second ? LAPD?

307
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,600
- I'm from Vegas, man.
- Give me the gun.

308
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,800
Oh my God.

309
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Charlie, wait.

310
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,700
Take one more step and
I'll drop you right there.

311
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,800
Is that how you greet
all your customers?

312
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,700
Mister, after what we've
been through you're lucky

313
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,900
we don't shoot you first
and greet you later.

314
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,700
Let me see your teeth.

315
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,200
Teeth, god damn it!
Let me see them!

316
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,400
No sharp teeth, Pop.

317
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,100
Okay then, how about
you tell us your name?

318
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,600
Michael.

319
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,400
Sorry about that, Michael.

320
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,800
We had this old lady here,
went crazy in my place.

321
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,700
She had these teeth. Never
seen anything like it

322
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,200
Practically bit
a man in half.

323
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,100
What are you doing
out here, anyway?

324
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,200
You don't look like any
policeman I ever saw.

325
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,300
Even the ones from L.A.

326
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:27,400
But he's got to be, right?
Who'd be crazy enough to steal a cop car?

327
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,500
- You don't know, do you?
- Don't know what?

328
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,700
We don't know anything.
Nothing works, the TV,

329
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,500
the radio, the phone.

330
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,000
- I'm running out of time.
- Hold on there, fella.

331
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,700
You better start talking or
get the hell out of here.

332
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Dad, just tell him
you're sorry.

333
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,100
Hey, hey, hey, Sir!

334
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,400
Now I'm sure you don't
want to go spilling blood

335
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,400
for no good reason, in front
of all these decent people.

336
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,900
What do you say?

337
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,200
Just let Bob go and then
you will be on your way, nice and easy.

338
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,600
They're here.

339
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,200
You're going to need this.

340
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,200
- Wait, who's here?
- More like her.

341
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,900
What do you mean like her?

342
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,500
Hold on. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

343
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,600
- Dad, I can handle it.
- He can handle it.

344
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:52,600
He doesn't have a choice.

345
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,600
Don't do anything brave.

346
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,800
- What's happening?
- Better get back inside.

347
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,600
Jeep, come on!

348
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,700
Everybody stay calm!

349
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,100
Okay, we're locked in here,
so what do we do now?

350
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,200
Alright, Rambo.
You got us up here.

351
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,300
You mind telling us
what we're fighting?

352
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,900
Listen!

353
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,400
You hear what I'm hearing?

354
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,900
- What the hell is that?
- Sounds almost like...

355
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Ice cream?

356
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,700
Can't be fucking
serious, right?

357
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,300
There's a safety switch on the side of
your weapon, Push it all the way down. Two clicks.

358
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,500
Now when this starts,
you hold on tight.

359
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,000
Otherwise you're going to
blow your hand off.

360
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
What the fuck are you
all looking at me for?

361
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,000
Audrey. Honey, listen. It's
the Ice Cream Man.

362
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,300
Oh, man, he don't
look that bad.

363
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,900
Oh shit, oh shit,
oh shit.

364
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,500
Oh, damn it!

365
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,800
Get ready.

366
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,700
Is that it?

367
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,700
Now! Shoot now!

368
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,300
They're just regular people.

369
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,600
Not Anymore!
Keep firing!

370
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Don't let them get
near the windows.

371
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,500
Howard!

372
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,800
See what you made
me do, mother?

373
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,300
There you are!

374
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,300
We got to running

375
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,500
Let me go! He's alive!
He's out there!

376
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,200
- He's out there.
- He's gone.

377
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,600
You okay?

378
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,200
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

379
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,600
Thanks.

380
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,300
I told you not to
do anything brave.

381
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,300
We got them running.

382
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,500
What happened?

383
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,400
Someone needs to
be on the roof.

384
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,500
- I'll go.
- Hold on.

385
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,000
You better start talking.

386
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:09,000
The last time God lost faith
in man he sent a flood.

387
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,600
This time, he sent
what you see outside.

388
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,200
Are you saying this is
the Apocalypse?

389
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,800
I'm saying this is
an extermination.

390
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:26,000
Those things outside are just vessels ,they're
possessed , the weakest willed are the easiest to turn.

391
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,500
Possessed by what?
Demons?

392
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,100
No...

393
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,600
By angels.

394
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,400
Hold on. I don't know what
book you've been reading

395
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:48,000
But in my version the
angels are good guys.

396
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,800
Well the truth, I'm afraid,
is never that simple.

397
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:54,300
Bullshit. I'm not a pastor,
but I've never heard of no

398
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,200
Ice Cream Man, or old lady
eating raw meat,

399
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,300
jumping on the ceiling
with baby teeth.

400
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,300
So I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

401
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,400
Hold on. How do you know
so much about them?

402
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,200
Because until last night,
I was on their side.

403
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,200
- So you're saying you...
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

404
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,000
Yesterday I was fucking
Santa Claus.

405
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You know this is crazy, right?
I mean....I don't even believe in God.

406
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,900
Well that's just fine, Bob, he
doesn't believe in you either.

407
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,300
He doesn't believe in
any of this anymore.

408
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,700
I knew this day was coming,
I just didn't think

409
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,000
- I'd be around to see it.
- Come on, Percy!

410
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,300
What are we even
talking about this for?

411
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:34,200
Angels, and possessed people.
It's not real! It's...

412
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,700
Have you looked
outside, Bob?

413
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,400
I mean , those people aren't exactly
our regular customers!

414
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,400
So, are you here to
protect us?

415
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,700
No, not you.

416
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,500
Her.

417
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,800
Me? Why me?

418
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,600
Because your child is the
only hope humanity has of survival.

419
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,400
Wait just a minute, this can't be
happening , I'm nobody, I'm just a waitress.

420
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,000
- I don't even own a car.
- None of that matters anymore.

421
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,000
Either your child lives
or mankind dies.

422
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,900
So we're supposed to
hold those things off

423
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,800
- until the baby gets here?
- That's it.

424
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,800
I'm only eight
months pregnant.

425
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,800
This shit can't be
happening, man.

426
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,300
How are we supposed to
survive here for a month?

427
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,600
We won't have to.

428
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,100
- It's coming soon, isn't it?
- Yes.

429
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,400
Listen. I simply don't care
what you people believe.

430
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,800
And those things outside,
they don't care either.

431
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,700
They just want
the child dead.

432
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,400
Now, this first attack was
a test of our strength.

433
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,800
The next will be a test
of our weakness.

434
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Now we can sit here and discuss it
or you can try to help me.

435
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:13,400
But believe me. Something
much worse is on the way.

436
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,000
Sons of bitches.

437
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,300
They're out there,
I can feel them.

438
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:41,500
- So what's with that gun?
- What?

439
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,000
Your piece. The one you
killed grandma with.

440
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,900
Don't reckon it's for
hunting buck.

441
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:53,100
- I use it for protection.
- Protection from what?

442
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,500
- From people.
- People?

443
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,300
- People that be starting shit.
- Regular people, or just...

444
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,400
No. Not regular regular
people, but you know...

445
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,800
Irregular people, then.

446
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,200
Get the fuck out
of here, man.

447
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,200
I got my reasons for doing
what I do, and that's that.

448
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,700
I've never actually
used it, alright?

449
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:37,100
I may have flashed it, scared a few
folks but, It never actually fired off.

450
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,900
Not until today.

451
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,000
This shit is crazy, man.

452
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,400
When I was a kid..., my father
would sit by my bed every night

453
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,000
before I went to sleep.

454
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,900
And he'd say to me:

455
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:26,300
"Percy, if you don't wake up tomorrow,
if it turns out that today

456
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,400
is your last day on earth.

457
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:45,600
Will you be proud of what you've
done in this life? cuz if you isn’t...

458
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:52,000
you better start
getting square."

459
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,200
Fuck it.

460
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,400
- On the house.
- Thank you.

461
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,900
- You hungry?
- No.

462
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,900
Just because it's the
end of the world

463
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,400
doesn't mean you
have to starve.

464
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,900
I'm just happy we still
have the gas on.

465
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,300
I never really cared
much for beer.

466
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,100
Howard was the beer
drinker in the family.

467
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:21,700
So what did you do? you know
Before you came here.

468
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,900
I was a soldier.
A general in His army.

469
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,600
So what changed?
What made you leave?

470
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,500
I was given an order
I didn't believe in.

471
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
He lost faith. I didn't.

472
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
How come you still have faith?

473
00:48:55,030 --> 00:49:01,400
I mean, seems like everything I have
faith in cost me nothing but trouble.

474
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:16,800
When God chose your kind
as the object of his love.

475
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:21,100
I was the first in all of heaven
to bow down before you.

476
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:30,000
My love and my hope for
mankind hasn't lessened yet.

477
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,400
But I have watched you
trample that gift.

478
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:41,700
I've watched you kill each
other over race and greed

479
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:46,500
Waging war over dust, rubble
and words in old books.

480
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:50,600
And yet in the midst of
all this darkness

481
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,200
I see some people who
will not be bowed.

482
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:01,800
I see some people
who will not give up.

483
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,300
Even when they know
hope is lost.

484
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:14,500
Some people, who realize that being
lost is so close to being found.

485
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,700
I see you, Jeep.

486
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,000
Fifteen years old, your mother leaves you,
your father withdraws from the world.

487
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:29,900
And you spend the next five years of your life
helping him find his way home.

488
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,700
You love a woman, who has the child of another,
and you love her making a fool of yourself.

489
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,800
Even though you know she may never
love you the way you love her.

490
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,600
You, Jeep.

491
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,000
You are the reason
I still have faith.

492
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,000
It's almost time
for the next shift.

493
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,600
You have a question?

494
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:58,300
I question myself.
And so should you.

495
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,100
Since their creation, He's
told us only to love them.

496
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,000
I cannot stop.

497
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,200
They brought this
judgment upon themselves.

498
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,200
They are just lost.

499
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,500
It's our place
to guide them.

500
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,400
It's our place
to obey.

501
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,500
Tell me, Gabriel.

502
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,800
Do you wish to give Him what
he wants...or what he needs?

503
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,400
It's not your test, Michael.
How dare you listen to His heart?

504
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,500
Because he made
this one.

505
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,600
It tells me we shouldn't
lose faith now.

506
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:48,100
Too late. The order has been given.
The weak will turn against the strong

507
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:50,500
and we will undo what
has been done.

508
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,200
And if you defy him..you'll
anger him for the last time

509
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,200
What if he failed....... Lord's coming to
man whether he wishes or not......

510
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,600
<I>Sandra

511
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,700
Howard?

512
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,700
Howard.

513
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,700
Sandra , help me.

514
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,200
Help me!

515
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:08,000
- What are you doing?
- He's alive! Let me go!

516
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,900
Mom, what are you
doing? Mom, stop!

517
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,400
- Your father is alive!
- He's not, mom!

518
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,700
Let go of me!

519
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,800
God!

520
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,400
No , don't

521
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:50,400
Percy?

522
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,600
It's my fault.
I fell asleep.

523
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,500
- Dad...
- Don't!

524
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:27,900
I did this he trusted me.
Just like your mother, I let him down.

525
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,200
Let everybody down.

526
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:49,800
Here. Mom, If you take
these you'll feel better, OK?

527
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,100
This is your fault.

528
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:17,600
We were only here because of you.
We sacrificed everything for you.

529
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:22,900
No. You wanted to go.
You said you wanted.

530
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,800
I loved my house.

531
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,400
I loved my life, and
you have ruined it.

532
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,700
You ruined everything!

533
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,300
- Everything!
- Enough.

534
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,100
You're just going to sit here
and torture your daughter like this?

535
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,900
Can you come help me
find a station that actually works?

536
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,700
Wait! Guys, you got to
take a look at this,

537
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:10,000
I'm hearing something.

538
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,000
<I>If you're hear my voice,
we're getting the first bits

539
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:19,400
<I>of good news since this
Apocalypse began, nearly 48 hours ago.

540
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,300
<I>A militia has formed on
the outskirts of Las Vegas

541
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,100
<I>and has begun to
engage those affected.

542
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:28,600
<I>Getting unconfirmed reports
of other militias gathering

543
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:32,600
<I>in Death Valley, Zion and
Red Ridge National Park.

544
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:34,300
Red Ridge, that's only
an hour from here.

545
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,200
Does that mean
we can leave?

546
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,400
No.

547
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,100
- We're not going anywhere.
- What?

548
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,500
I don't know about you,
but I got to get out of here.

549
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,200
I won't risk being on the
move when the baby comes.

550
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,500
It's too dangerous.

551
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:02,000
Dangerous? What the fuck
you mean too dangerous?

552
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:05,600
<I>...strength to survive. And
have mercy for those

553
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,700
<I>who are already lost.

554
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:37,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

555
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:42,800
You okay?

556
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:50,000
The craziest thing is
I don't want this baby.

557
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,600
I even went down to the
clinic, did you know that?

558
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,100
I remember sitting in
the waiting room...

559
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,100
absolutely sure I was
doing the right thing.

560
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:14,100
Then I started getting this feeling like if I was
falling into the deepest, darkest hole imaginable.

561
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:20,400
I couldn't breathe and
either couldn't speak.

562
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:28,100
I kept thinking this must be
what death feels like.

563
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,100
And when they called
my name, I just ran.

564
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,000
For a long time I...

565
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,900
I always thought that I could
go back whenever I'd want.

566
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,000
And end it like
I'd planned.

567
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:58,000
But then I started getting
that damn feeling again

568
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,000
I knew I had no choice.

569
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:08,000
Somehow this had
already been decided.

570
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,300
It made me just...

571
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:18,500
Made me hate this
thing growing inside me.

572
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,700
You shouldn't say
things like that, Charlie.

573
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:28,600
It isn’t right. You'll get through
this, I know you will.

574
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,000
Why do you have so much
faith in me, Jeep?

575
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,600
God knows I've never given
you or anybody a reason to.

576
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:45,300
Or is it just that you don't have any other
hard-luck cases to follow around, is that it?

577
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,800
No. You're not the only one who’s
had it hard around here, okay?

578
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:56,800
Let me know when you stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

579
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:10,900
- So now you just have to...
- Two clicks. All the way down.

580
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:15,200
I dated a marine last summer.
He was kind of a gun freak.

581
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,900
- My parents hated him.
- I bet they did.

582
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:28,300
My mom was right. It is
my fault we are here.

583
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:33,300
- She didn't mean that.
- Yes, she did, it's true.

584
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:37,600
I mean the only reason why we're
moving is because of me.

585
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:41,400
They thought my friends
were a bad influence.

586
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,700
But I was the bad influence.

587
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,700
So really fucked up.

588
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:58,100
When I was a Shorty, the
only time my old man ever

589
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:01,500
gave me attention was
when I did something bad.

590
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,500
So you know what
I did, right?

591
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,600
What?

592
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,400
I got really good
at being bad.

593
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:15,000
The problem is, when you get older,
when you have a family,

594
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,200
being bad is not so good.

595
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,100
Is it over?

596
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:43,600
- Are we back in business?
- I don't think so.

597
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:59,100
- You better go downstairs
- No, I can handle it.

598
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,600
- Get downstairs.
- No. I can handle it.

599
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,500
Take this just in case.

600
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,700
Get ready.

601
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:26,800
-Wait a minute.
- Kyle, are they...?

602
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,500
Kyle!

603
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:48,700
It's a trap! they see them coming
and turn their lights on.

604
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:53,000
Hey! Get back in your car!
Get back in your car!

605
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Daddy

606
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,900
They won't make it!

607
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,200
Get in the car!

608
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,900
Don't, you're going to hit him!

609
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,200
What the hell is
that guy doing?

610
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,100
Don't open the door.
If you do, we all die.

611
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,600
Now what?

612
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,500
Now what?

613
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,700
Fooled you.

614
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,600
Damn it to hell!

615
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,700
Oh no. Audrey.

616
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,100
You're going to die now.

617
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:45,800
She's just a kid,
you can't let her die.

618
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,200
I swear if you don't
do something, I will.

619
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:01,000
Wait. You stay here.

620
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,800
Open the door.

621
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,700
Come on!
Run!

622
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,400
- I'll get some water.
- Jeep!

623
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:07,300
Don't be scared. I just want
to play with your baby.

624
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,600
- Are you hurt?
- Where is he?

625
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,600
What the hell?

626
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,400
Oh God.

627
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,300
It's coming.

628
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:20,600
Wait , just because I'm a
girl does not mean

629
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:21,900
I know how
to do this.

630
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:23,700
Be calm and do
exactly as I tell you.

631
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,600
How do you know
what to do?

632
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,100
What a way to bring
a child into the world.

633
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,000
- What the fuck is that?
- He's coming.

634
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:46,800
- We need to hurry now.
- What do you mean hurry?

635
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,400
This isn't exactly something
we can hurry.

636
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:50,000
Charlie, I need you
to push now.

637
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,700
You push like you never
pushed before. Push!

638
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:55,700
- Michael, who is coming?
- Push!

639
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,400
How many bullets do
you have left?

640
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,900
Come on!
That’s good!

641
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,700
Charlie, you did it!

642
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:25,800
You did it.

643
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,200
It's okay, no, it's okay, your
baby is fine. Look.

644
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,600
It's alright.
Give her some time.

645
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:52,300
Audrey.

646
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,300
Mom
It's here , He is alive

647
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:07,000
He's beautiful, I remember when
you were a baby.

648
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:13,000
You used to look at
me just like that , just like that.

649
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:18,100
Audrey, I'm sorry about
what I said to you before.

650
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,300
- I didn't mean it.
- Yeah.

651
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:23,700
You're the most precious
thing in the world to me.

652
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
- It's just you and me now.
- I know.

653
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:38,700
- Are we safe now?
- No.

654
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:47,500
Now, at least, the child
will have a chance to grow up.

655
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,200
A chance to lead the
world out of darkness.

656
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,800
What happens until then?

657
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,600
You'll need to show him how.

658
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,200
What makes you think
I can do that?

659
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,400
What makes you think
I want to do that?

660
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,100
If he's so important,
why don't you take him?

661
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:23,000
Because his journey is yours.

662
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,800
Michael, we need to go.

663
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:00,100
The possessed can't go near the child, but he sent
someone who can, someone like me.

664
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,800
- Like you?
- Gabriel.

665
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:05,200
He's come here to do
what I wouldn't.

666
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:07,900
You were the one who was
supposed to kill the baby?

667
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:10,400
That's the order
you didn't obey?

668
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,400
- We need to go.
- What is he talking about?

669
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,100
Go grab whatever
weapons we have left.

670
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:15,400
- What are you talking about?
- We need to go now.

671
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:17,100
- Tell me!
- Now!

672
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:26,700
The baby. The baby was
never meant to be born.

673
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,800
But the future has been
unwritten. The child lives.

674
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:35,700
And while he does,
there's still hope.

675
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:38,600
Audrey!

676
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,700
- Mom!
- Come, come.

677
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:44,300
- What are you doing?
- I heard them say.

678
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:47,200
They just want the baby.
I will give them the baby.

679
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:49,100
- Then they'll let us go!
- Give him back to me!

680
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:53,200
Why!? You didn't even want
him in the first place!

681
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,900
Come on, Audrey.
Audrey, come with me!

682
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:06,900
It's just one baby.

683
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,000
It's just one baby.

684
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:54,500
No!

685
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,400
No, Jeep, not now!

686
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,600
The child! Get the
child out of here!

687
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:04,400
- What about you?
- Don't be afraid.

688
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,400
Find the Prophets. Learn to
read the instructions.

689
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,900
- Prophets? What Prophets? What instructions?
- Go!

690
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,700
I knew he'd send
you, Gabriel.

691
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:49,200
You were always so
eager to please him.

692
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:54,900
Unlike you.
The rebellious son.

693
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:13,400
Your wings. They would
have helped you now.

694
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,500
To not feel that burden
is a dream.

695
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,400
You think you can deny Him
and not pay the price?

696
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,300
The child lives.

697
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,600
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

698
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,800
Yours is a fools sacrifice, Michael.

699
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,800
You can help them run
but they won't escape.

700
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,800
Neither will you, my brother.

701
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,400
I'm not running anymore.

702
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:25,200
That's enough.
There's another way.

703
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,800
There is no other way.

704
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,700
That's enough.

705
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:24,400
You wanted to live
like one of them.

706
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,500
Now you die
like one of them.

707
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:58,000
Jeep. Your arm.

708
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,300
The instructions.

709
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:23,400
Sorry. We're out of business.

710
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,400
"RED RIDGE"
We're here.

711
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,600
Okay ,we need to figure out
our weapon situation.

712
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,200
Hopefully Michael didn't take
everything out of the car.

713
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,600
Look around.

714
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,900
I've got a flare gun
and a couple of...

715
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,100
Audrey, flare gun!

716
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,700
Audrey!

717
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,800
Do it!

718
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:23,800
Jeep?

719
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,300
- The baby?
- Alive.

720
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,400
Audrey?

721
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,700
Give me the child.

722
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:25,700
No.

723
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,500
Then death will
come to you both.

724
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,500
No!

725
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:46,900
Why do you continue to fight?

726
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:51,800
When you know all hope is lost.

727
01:24:57,300 --> 01:24:58,900
Fuck you.

728
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,600
This can't be.
You've disobeyed Him.

729
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,500
You gave him what he asked.

730
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,400
I gave him what he needed.

731
01:25:45,071 --> 01:25:46,382
Do it.

732
01:25:51,739 --> 01:25:55,416
Do it! Do it!

733
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:58,059
No.

734
01:26:03,415 --> 01:26:06,153
I wouldn’t have shown you such mercy

735
01:26:08,568 --> 01:26:12,468
That is why you have failed

736
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,200
When I was a little girl ,
my mother spoke of a prophecy.

737
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,200
Of a time when all the world
would be covered in darkness

738
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:22,100
and the fate of mankind would be decided.
One night I finally got up the courage to ask my mother

739
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,800
why God was so mad
at his children.

740
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,100
"I don't know," she said,
tucking the covers around me,

741
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,900
"I guess he just got tired
of all the bullshit."
