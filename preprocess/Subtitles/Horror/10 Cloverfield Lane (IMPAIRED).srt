Michelle, please don't hang up.

00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:27,448
Just talk to me, okay?

4
00:04:27,515 --> 00:04:29,262
I can't believe you just left.

5
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,742
Michelle

6
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:34,000
Come back.

7
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,515
Please say something.

8
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:41,466
Michelle?  Talk to me.

9
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,795
Look, we had an argument, couples fight,
that is ..

10
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,497
No reason to just leave everything behind.

11
00:04:49,986 --> 00:04:52,130
Running away isn't going to help anything.
Michelle, please ..

Please,

Just let me go, okay? I won't tell anybody,
I promise.

26
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:35,208
Please just let me go.  Please.

27
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,951
You need fluids.

28
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:39,773
You were in shock.

29
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,693
What're you going to do to me?

30
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,386
I'm going to keep you alive.

31
00:10:58,422 --> 00:11:00,724
Work on getting handy with these.

32
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,040
My boyfriend was expecting me.

33
00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:10,902
He'll send the cops looking.

34
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,640
I'm sorry ..

35
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:15,724
But no one is looking for you.

36
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:59,360
You got some fight in you.

37
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:04,111
I can respect that.

38
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,435
But don't even think about trying that again.

39
00:15:11,137 --> 00:15:13,226
You're lucky to be here at all.

40
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,351
My generosity only extends .. so far.

41
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,426
Eggs,

42
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,431
Tylenol to help with your pain.

43
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,800
Please .. please .. just let me go.

44
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,235
- Please.
- There's nowhere to go, Michelle.

45
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,040
That looks pretty [???].

46
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:40,880
Given it as how I saved your life,
I think that's acceptable.

47
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:43,195
You're lucky to be here at all.

48
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:47,457
- What do you mean?
- I found you.

49
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,288
And I saved your life, by bringing you here.

50
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:53,644
I don't understand,

51
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:07,813
There's been an attack.

52
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:12,137
What?

53
00:16:12,324 --> 00:16:14,902
An attack. A big one.

54
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:17,955
I'm not sure yet if it's chemical, or nuclear.

55
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:20,635
But down here we're safe.

56
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:24,004
And where are we, exactly?

57
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,920
Underneath my farmhouse.

58
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,875
40 miles outside of Lake Charles.

59
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,484
- I ..  was driving north of here.
- You were in an accident.

60
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,800
You were turned over on the side of the road.
I was driving by, and I saw you.

61
00:16:43,347 --> 00:16:45,348
I saved your life, Michelle.

62
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,475
I couldn't just leave you there.

63
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,155
Thank you so much, for saving my life.  I ..

64
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:03,684
I guess I should, I should go to a hospital, now.

65
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:08,244
You can't leave.

66
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,266
An attack means all of them.

67
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,666
Which contaminates the air above ground.
That's, that's how it works.

68
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,284
How, how long do we have to wait until it's safe?

69
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,991
Depends on the proximity to the closest blast.
One year, maybe two.

70
00:17:26,551 --> 00:17:29,715
And that's if we're, we're talking
about weapons that we know of.

71
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:34,840
Russians were developing some nasty stuff.
And it the martians finally found a way to get here.

72
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:39,955
Their weapons will, will make our nukes
look like, like sticks and stones.

73
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,631
Luckily,

74
00:17:45,546 --> 00:17:47,208
I prepared for this.

75
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:59,444
I need to use your phone, then,

76
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,622
To call my family.
And, and tell them that I'm safe here.

77
00:18:04,035 --> 00:18:07,337
- And make sure they're okay.
- Michelle, they're not okay.

78
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:11,595
How do you know that?

79
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,995
Everyone outside of here is dead.

80
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:27,164
What about you?
Don't you have a family?

81
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,050
No

82
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:33,155
Who's that?

83
00:18:34,702 --> 00:18:35,906
Excuse me.

84
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:45,134
What is it now?

85
00:18:47,404 --> 00:18:48,671
Wait.

86
00:18:58,715 --> 00:19:01,857
You know what, Michelle?
I'm going to tell you, what I told him..

87
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:04,417
You need to eat, you need to sleep,

88
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:07,431
And you need to start showing me a
little bit of appreciation.

89
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,084
My name is Howard, by the way.

90
00:20:00,577 --> 00:20:02,408
God, oh shit.

91
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:04,640
I'm sorry,

92
00:20:08,324 --> 00:20:11,080
Sorry about that.  I didn't mean to ..

93
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:12,620
Scare you.

94
00:20:12,684 --> 00:20:15,364
You, hmm,  hmm, you hungry?

95
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:23,488
So how're you doing, huh?  You okay?

96
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:26,515
What is this?

97
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:27,977
It's a bunker.

98
00:20:28,653 --> 00:20:31,613
Your room is a bit of a fixer-upper, but ..

99
00:20:31,684 --> 00:20:33,453
At least you got the door.

100
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,013
A scary door, but you still got the door.

101
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:39,284
How long have you been down here?

102
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:43,440
A couple of days, I think.  You know,
it's actually kind of hard to tell.

103
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:46,826
No windows, the sunlight, and everything.

104
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:48,990
I mean, how do we get out of here?

105
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:51,960
He didn't tell you?

106
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:54,035
About ..

107
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,128
Getting out of here,
is the last thing you want to do.

108
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:02,631
Cause the air out there,

109
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:04,715
It's contaminated.

110
00:21:06,484 --> 00:21:08,210
I see you've met Emmett

111
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:14,580
- What happened to him?
- He did that to himself.

112
00:21:15,031 --> 00:21:17,382
And his stumbling around isn't helping anything.

113
00:21:17,431 --> 00:21:18,955
What you heard earlier,

114
00:21:19,062 --> 00:21:23,190
Was him knocking over a shelf with
a whole week's worth of food.

115
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,444
Which he's sorry for, correct?

116
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:28,760
Totally.

117
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,537
Let's go.  Bathroom time.

118
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,475
This is the common are.  Good for R&R.

119
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,790
As you can see, I've planned for a long stay.

120
00:21:55,062 --> 00:21:58,590
The applaponic(???) system cleans
the air and keeps it fresh.

121
00:21:59,004 --> 00:22:02,297
This is the living room.
Help yourself to any reading.

122
00:22:02,742 --> 00:22:04,835
If you like to watch films,

123
00:22:04,977 --> 00:22:07,826
I have some on DVD and VHS cassette.

124
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,533
Just make sure you put them back
in their sleeve when they're done.

125
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:16,782
The kitchen is fully functional. There's
an electric stove, refrigerator.

126
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:19,146
Freezer, silverware.

127
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,780
And that table is a family heirloom,
which means watch your glasses.

128
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,862
Always use coasters and placemats.

129
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,871
Keep you hands to yourself!

130
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:32,773
Understand?

131
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:34,884
No touching.

132
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,546
Take a seat.

133
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,226
This way.

134
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:08,586
This is my private space

135
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,702
Off-limits,
unless I give express permission.

136
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:14,977
Go ahead.

137
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,124
- Nah, I don't need to.
- You will though.

138
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:22,804
And I've got to pace these things out,
so please.

139
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:28,591
- I need privacy.
- You're welcome to close the curtain.

140
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,951
I can't with you standing there.

141
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:40,382
And I can't trust you not to burn this
place down. This is for my own safety.

142
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,991
I'm not some .. pervert.  Just go.

143
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:00,671
Don't flush unless you've gone.

144
00:24:01,853 --> 00:24:03,724
Can't afford wasting flushes.

145
00:24:11,973 --> 00:24:13,213
Take a seat.

146
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,724
Are you hungry?

147
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:21,844
Those are Megan's.

148
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,555
She never went anywhere without two
or three of those things.

149
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,764
Who's Megan?

150
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:30,742
Megan's not with us anymore.

151
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:38,960
Don't worry.  Just the generator.

152
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:44,404
Maybe it's a car up front.

153
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,662
- That's not possible.
-  I heard one earlier.

154
00:24:49,951 --> 00:24:50,822
Above my room.

155
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,213
If you had heard a car,
the driver would be long dead by now.

156
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:58,151
Shouldn't we at least try
.. to call the police?

157
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:02,662
- Someone to find out what actually happened?
- There's no one left to call.

158
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:05,302
See that?  Nothing's coming through.

159
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,275
You think I sound crazy.

160
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,284
It's amazing, you people..

161
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:24,555
You wear helmets when you ride your bikes,
you have seat-belts,

162
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,853
You're in your cars,
you have alarm systems to protect your homes.

163
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,893
But what do you do when those alarms go off?

164
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:35,813
Crazy, is building your ark after
the flood is already come.

165
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:46,217
I think now might be time you
met Frank and Mildred.

166
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:34,136
Closest I can get to in airlock.

167
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,257
See?

168
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:10,315
What happened to them?

169
00:27:10,724 --> 00:27:12,657
They weren't as lucky as you.

170
00:27:13,182 --> 00:27:14,720
It's the air, Michelle.

171
00:27:14,871 --> 00:27:16,940
That's what happens when you get exposed.

172
00:27:33,488 --> 00:27:37,306
I keep this door sealed, at all times.

173
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,542
No one comes in or out.

174
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:57,946
Met Frank and Mildred, huh?

175
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,764
It's funny, right?

176
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,408
The whole world ends.  And the thing's he's
most upset about is a pair of dead pigs.

177
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,831
You gonna need some .. uh, reading material.

178
00:28:11,742 --> 00:28:14,017
That's all there is (???), sorry.

179
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,097
My idead of how to learn to do
a french braid, so..

180
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:27,173
If you want me to do that for you,
just let me know.

181
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:36,350
What do you know about him?

182
00:28:38,928 --> 00:28:40,991
He was in the Navy, I know that.

183
00:28:42,231 --> 00:28:45,457
I guess he did, uh,
some stuff with satellites.

184
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,333
What kinds of stuff?

185
00:28:49,217 --> 00:28:51,071
Satellite .. stuff.

186
00:28:52,902 --> 00:28:54,524
And what brought him out here?

187
00:28:55,146 --> 00:28:56,444
I'm not sure.

188
00:28:57,942 --> 00:28:59,848
He bought this property a whle back.

189
00:29:00,937 --> 00:29:05,075
I never paid much attention, until he
hired me to help him get this place set up.

190
00:29:06,817 --> 00:29:08,600
The work, was, uh..

191
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:10,853
Entertaining, though, that's for sure.

192
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,991
You know, Howard, is like a black belt
in conspiracy theories.

193
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:20,404
Plus, you know, how often do you get
hired to build the doomsday bunker?

194
00:29:24,382 --> 00:29:25,800
He .. kidnapped you?

195
00:29:27,462 --> 00:29:28,035
No.

196
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,862
What happened to your arm?
You were trying to escape?

197
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,871
I was trying to get in.

198
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,364
And I watched Howard build this
place, piece by piece, for years.

199
00:29:39,502 --> 00:29:40,946
He was always talking about..

200
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:43,368
you know, possible attacks,

201
00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:47,200
Al-Qeda, Russia, South Korea,

202
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:50,017
- You mean North Korea?
- the, the.. is that the Korean one?

203
00:29:52,315 --> 00:29:53,702
Yeah, that one.  Hmm ..

204
00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:58,777
And, hmm, you know. Pour all his money into this
place, took to it, like his life depended on it.

205
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,937
Which,.. you know,

206
00:30:03,013 --> 00:30:04,737
That stays with you.

207
00:30:08,662 --> 00:30:09,755
So,

208
00:30:12,284 --> 00:30:13,577
He told all this,

209
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,617
While you're building his bomb shelter,

210
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,497
And now he says that ..

211
00:30:19,786 --> 00:30:22,195
The air is contaminated, and everybody's dead.

212
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:27,026
Yeah, I know what you're getting at.
But there's more to it.

213
00:30:27,111 --> 00:30:28,608
Howard abducted me.

214
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,164
He drove me off the road,
and he dragged me here.

215
00:30:34,911 --> 00:30:37,457
So whatever he's telling you
about the .. air,

216
00:30:38,022 --> 00:30:42,631
- Some big attack. The purpose of this shelter, is a lie.
- No, no way.

217
00:30:44,764 --> 00:30:46,302
The attack, I saw it myself.

218
00:30:46,942 --> 00:30:48,062
What do you mean?

219
00:30:49,413 --> 00:30:50,897
Coming on my way from work,

220
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:54,631
And, looked like a flash.

221
00:30:55,831 --> 00:30:56,955
Bright red,

222
00:30:58,128 --> 00:31:00,217
Like an explosion, from way far off.

223
00:31:02,306 --> 00:31:03,675
Wasn't like fireworks,

224
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:08,782
No, it was more this like something
your read about in the bible.

225
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,177
So what you saw was a flashing light?
Lightning?

226
00:31:17,302 --> 00:31:20,204
- Fire that cleared up?
- I'm not .. explaining it right.

227
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,013
This wasn't like anything I've ever seen.

228
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,848
Right here,

229
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:24,897
Above us.

230
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:30,060
Did you hear someone?

231
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:31,448
Right over me (???).

232
00:31:36,288 --> 00:31:37,760
That's impossible.

233
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,293
- The, the air, is ..
- What, it's contaminated?

234
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:45,253
- How do you know that?
- Because I told him.

235
00:31:47,786 --> 00:31:48,897
Dinner's ready.

236
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,626
I see you two are getting along?

237
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,608
How's that sauce?

238
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,644
- It's fine,
- As cooks go, I'm okay.

239
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:48,337
Not great, but okay.

240
00:32:49,382 --> 00:32:51,120
Megan was a good cook.

241
00:32:52,768 --> 00:32:54,773
You'll learn a little cooking.

242
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:06,693
It's delicious.

243
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:09,857
It's the best sauce I ever tasted.

244
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:11,893
Are you being funny?

245
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,471
No, I mean ..

246
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,471
Considering the alternative,
which is, you know..

247
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:20,720
Get burned up in a chemical
attack, or nuclear ..

248
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:23,608
I say being alive, and down here is ..

249
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:27,031
It's made a fried turd taste
pretty good, so..

250
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,991
Best damn sauce I ever had.

251
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,244
and [???] you point,
and please watch your language at the table.

252
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,004
Right.

253
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,933
You know what I haven't been able to
get out of my head, for some reason.

254
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,742
Ever since I got down here,

255
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,466
Tatoos.

256
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,760
I always wanted one.

257
00:33:55,088 --> 00:33:59,404
But I never got any.  Because everyone always said, nah, no,
Emmett you'll never get a decent job if you got it.

258
00:33:59,822 --> 00:34:01,053
Whatever

259
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:02,840
Like that matters now, right?

260
00:34:04,106 --> 00:34:07,511
Tell you what, I had know this was coming,
I'd gotten like 50 of them.

261
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,355
That's where I'm at.

262
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:14,422
I would look like a circus freak or something.
I would just be covered.  Head to toe, tattoos all over ..

263
00:34:14,684 --> 00:34:18,720
Everywhere, face, shirt, right there.
Across my forehead.

264
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:22,146
Just my name, Emmett.

265
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:23,857
Or, you know..

266
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,786
- "Thug Life"
- [Michelle laughs]

267
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:28,066
- 'YOLO'

268
00:34:28,213 --> 00:34:32,182
I don't even know what that means, but, I hear
people saying it all the time.  So it must be cool.

269
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:38,226
Hey, what about you, Howard?

270
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,333
Anything you wish you'd done?

271
00:34:47,457 --> 00:34:49,084
In all honesty, no.

272
00:34:50,386 --> 00:34:51,280
No?

273
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,133
No crazy nights in Vegas?,

274
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,684
Maybe, ah, take a pilgrimage to Waco?

275
00:35:02,155 --> 00:35:04,213
Everything I wanted to do, I did.

276
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:07,160
I focused on being prepared.

277
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,702
And I was.

278
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,648
And here we are.

279
00:35:23,528 --> 00:35:24,782
Oh, my goodness..

280
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:26,644
Is that Monopoly?

281
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:29,300
There we go.

282
00:35:29,924 --> 00:35:31,626
Yeah, that's how we kill the time.

283
00:35:32,053 --> 00:35:36,115
I mean, what you say?  We're going to be
down here like what, a year, two, three?

284
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:40,417
Bet you if we started a game right now,
we might even get halfway finished..

285
00:35:40,462 --> 00:35:41,560
Stop talking!

286
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:53,662
You don't need to make jokes about how
long we're going to be down here.

287
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:56,017
When nobody knows how long that's going to be.

288
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,555
You humor is not funny.

289
00:35:59,035 --> 00:36:02,430
I don't appreciate it while I'm trying
to eat, and neither does Michelle.

290
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:05,617
Now please shut up, and let us eat in peace.

291
00:36:34,186 --> 00:36:35,311
Emmett?

292
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,186
Pass me a napkin.

293
00:36:47,648 --> 00:36:48,835
I know what you're saying.

294
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,635
I never could finish Monopoly.

295
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,466
That game really does take forever, right?

296
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,102
For me though, it was .. hmm,

297
00:36:58,026 --> 00:37:01,048
'Chutes, and Ladders'.  Ahmm,

298
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,102
'Sorry',

299
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,826
and 'Trouble'.

300
00:37:05,275 --> 00:37:08,697
And that thing with the dice, and that thing
that you press, what is that called?

301
00:37:08,742 --> 00:37:12,013
That,  that .. 'PoppleMatic Bubble!',
yeah, right!

302
00:37:12,537 --> 00:37:14,795
You ever play that, what was it, 'Operation'?

303
00:37:15,168 --> 00:37:17,626
- Loath 'Operation"
- Oh, man, I couldn't play that game.

304
00:37:18,897 --> 00:37:21,866
That noise that thing would make
when you hit that edge, when..

305
00:37:22,462 --> 00:37:24,680
- Good lord,
- That was scary.

306
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:27,217
Can you give me the salt?

307
00:37:30,573 --> 00:37:31,395
Please?

308
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,008
Ah, shoot.  Sorry.

309
00:37:39,577 --> 00:37:41,551
I'm going to need the pepper also,

310
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,888
- What exactly do you think you're doing?
- I'm just asking for the pepper.

311
00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:54,680
- The hell you were?  What was that?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

312
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:56,906
You trying to insult me?

313
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,084
Here in a shelter that I built,
that's keeping you alive?

314
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,128
You don't think I see what you just did?

315
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,448
Is that how you thank me for saving your life?

316
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:09,120
- Calm down.
- Shut Up!

317
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:11,430
Shut Up!  And stay in your seat!

318
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:18,857
Is it?

319
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,271
Let me tell you,

320
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:24,440
I know what a traitor looks like,

321
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,795
Understand?

322
00:38:27,644 --> 00:38:32,626
I have shown you nothing but
generosity, and hospitality.

323
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,031
I want you to apologize.

324
00:38:38,973 --> 00:38:41,151
And tell me you're going to behave.

325
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,191
I will.

326
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:50,755
You will what?

327
00:38:53,991 --> 00:38:55,582
I'll behave.

328
00:38:57,773 --> 00:38:59,426
And I'm so sorry.

329
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,977
You have to stay hydrated, [???].

330
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,960
It's easy to forget down here.

331
00:39:47,475 --> 00:39:48,404
What's wrong?

332
00:39:50,232 --> 00:39:51,766
Nothing

333
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,653
Where are my keys?

334
00:40:22,964 --> 00:40:24,026
Michelle!

335
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:25,382
Stop!

336
00:40:37,928 --> 00:40:39,106
Give me those keys!

337
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,671
- Come on.
- I'm going.

338
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:42,910
No! No! [???]

339
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,364
No! Don't do it!

340
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:00,330
No!

341
00:41:00,386 --> 00:41:01,840
Don't open that door!

342
00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:06,582
It's a car!

343
00:41:07,106 --> 00:41:09,510
It's a car!  I see a car!

344
00:41:09,591 --> 00:41:11,266
Here!  Here!

345
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:13,417
Here!

346
00:41:13,616 --> 00:41:15,116
Michelle, listen to me, don't do it!

347
00:41:18,754 --> 00:41:20,488
Help me!

348
00:41:21,977 --> 00:41:23,844
- There's a woman.
- Open the door.

349
00:41:25,782 --> 00:41:29,860
- I just.. I want to come inside.
- She looks hurt, she wants me to let her in!

350
00:41:29,906 --> 00:41:32,330
Do not let her in!

351
00:41:32,422 --> 00:41:34,100
Look at her face, Michelle!

352
00:41:34,164 --> 00:41:38,440
No, no, no .. no, no.

353
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:42,010
Please open,  I don't want to die.

354
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,770
Please, help me, I don't want to die.

355
00:41:46,282 --> 00:41:50,652
Just a little, oh , please open the door.

356
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,688
- Open it.
- She's begging me!

357
00:41:53,755 --> 00:41:55,390
You can't help her!

358
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:57,890
- Nobody can.
- It'll be okay.

359
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:01,830
[???] It' be okay, all of us.

360
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,315
Open the door!

361
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,500
Don't listen to her!

362
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:08,200
Open the door, you bitch!

363
00:42:08,471 --> 00:42:10,538
Let me in!

364
00:42:10,582 --> 00:42:16,540
Let me in!   Let me in!   Let me in!

365
00:42:17,947 --> 00:42:19,380
Now!

366
00:42:19,777 --> 00:42:21,880
Now.  Now!

367
00:42:22,315 --> 00:42:23,910
Now!

368
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,150
Open!

369
00:42:54,111 --> 00:42:55,810
I know it's hard.

370
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,537
Realizing they're all gone.

371
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:03,435
The ones you love.

372
00:43:12,808 --> 00:43:15,017
I have something to confess to you.

373
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:19,333
I crashed into your car.

374
00:43:20,128 --> 00:43:21,680
Your accident.

375
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,568
Was my fault.

376
00:43:26,653 --> 00:43:31,328
When I found out about the incoming
attack, I got frantic.

377
00:43:31,755 --> 00:43:34,395
I knew I needed to get back here
as soon as possible,

378
00:43:34,568 --> 00:43:36,822
Oh, I was driving like a maniac,

379
00:43:40,306 --> 00:43:42,204
I tried to pass you, and..

380
00:43:46,635 --> 00:43:48,808
I'm the reason you went off the road.

381
00:43:50,844 --> 00:43:53,640
And I know I seem like a sensible guy,

382
00:43:54,315 --> 00:43:57,102
But, at the time, I wasn't myself.

383
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:02,280
It was an accident.  But it was my fault.

384
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:06,573
I was afraid to tell you.

385
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:12,390
I'm sorry.

386
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:23,746
You should shower,

387
00:44:23,951 --> 00:44:28,253
You had the smallest amount of air that
came through the hinges, could be toxic.

388
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,964
These are Megan's.

389
00:44:33,053 --> 00:44:34,702
If you want them.

390
00:44:39,435 --> 00:44:41,511
I recognize that woman's car.

391
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:44,620
Her name was Leslie, I think.

392
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,786
You knew her?

393
00:44:48,324 --> 00:44:49,808
She was a neighbor.

394
00:44:50,848 --> 00:44:53,830
Emmett wasn't the only one
that knew about this place.

395
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:58,577
If any others somehow survived,
they could be coming here too.

396
00:45:01,386 --> 00:45:05,146
As of Friday, kindness and generosity
are antiquated customs.

397
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,097
I'm going to need some stitches.

398
00:45:24,924 --> 00:45:26,475
Why, you want me to..?

399
00:45:26,551 --> 00:45:28,408
This is your doing, isn't it?

400
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:31,111
I mean,
I don't think I'm really qualified.

401
00:45:31,177 --> 00:45:32,568
I'll walk you through it.

402
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:37,945
Here.

403
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,973
Have a drink.

404
00:45:45,906 --> 00:45:47,102
What is it?

405
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:49,533
Technically, it's ..

406
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:50,960
Vodka

407
00:45:54,648 --> 00:45:57,182
Safe.  I distill it myself.

408
00:46:07,324 --> 00:46:11,453
- I just said I distill it, I didn't say anything
about it tasting good. -- Yeah, that's awful.

409
00:46:11,515 --> 00:46:12,893
You want it on the rocks.

410
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,928
Little trick I taught myself as a young man
stationed on a ship, with way too much free time.

411
00:46:22,137 --> 00:46:27,008
Every now and again, if the CO was working us
too hard. We'd freeze and snap the knob off..

412
00:46:27,093 --> 00:46:29,426
the bathroom door while they were still inside.

413
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:32,662
I guess it took an hour or two, to get out

414
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,444
I'm good.

415
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,146
Suit yourself.  Cheers.

416
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:49,773
This is clean.

417
00:46:50,137 --> 00:46:52,453
All you need to do is .. stitch.

418
00:47:15,075 --> 00:47:16,466
You're doing fine.

419
00:47:20,697 --> 00:47:22,546
Stuff I grabbed from your car.

420
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,977
Didn't have time to bring in the booze.

421
00:47:25,404 --> 00:47:26,720
Sadly.

422
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,200
What is all that?

423
00:47:35,275 --> 00:47:37,057
I wanted to design clothes.

424
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:39,248
No wonder you were so good with the stiches.

425
00:47:41,915 --> 00:47:43,528
Megan wanted to be an artist.

426
00:47:46,777 --> 00:47:47,831
- She was your daughter?
- Yeah

427
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:00,680
She was smart, loved to read,
the magazines or just for fun.

428
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,764
She inhaled books.
Anything with Paris.

429
00:48:04,022 --> 00:48:06,897
She liked their movies.
Their culture, you know.

430
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,831
We used to have this little joke,
every once in a while, I'd ask her..

431
00:48:11,017 --> 00:48:13,035
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

432
00:48:14,386 --> 00:48:16,035
And you know what she'd say?

433
00:48:17,737 --> 00:48:19,146
French.

434
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:21,986
Anyway,

435
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:24,893
Her mother turned her against me.

436
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,733
Took her off to Chicago.

437
00:48:28,675 --> 00:48:30,550
People are strange creatures

438
00:48:31,524 --> 00:48:34,688
You can't always convince them that
safety is in their own  best interest

439
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,715
You don't know they're gone.

440
00:48:41,631 --> 00:48:42,684
Anyway,

441
00:48:43,022 --> 00:48:45,146
At least I tried to help them.

442
00:48:57,257 --> 00:48:59,955
Hey, you know there is nothing
you could've done for that woman

443
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:04,022
Even if you had let her in,
she still would've died.

444
00:49:09,982 --> 00:49:13,524
You asked earlier about .. regrets,

445
00:49:16,102 --> 00:49:17,657
Yeah, I got some of those.

446
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,448
Welcome to the club.

447
00:49:30,853 --> 00:49:33,826
I mean, I lived my life
in a 40-mile radius.

448
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,524
And that was by design,
I made sure that happened.

449
00:49:40,204 --> 00:49:42,275
I was so fast in high school,

450
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:44,920
I even managed to outrun my bad grades.

451
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,511
I was all-state track,

452
00:49:51,746 --> 00:49:53,404
Three years in a row.

453
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,431
Caught a full ride to Louisiana Tech
up there in Ruston.

454
00:50:02,693 --> 00:50:05,764
I remember I spent the last
two weeks of that summer,

455
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:10,426
Showing off the bus ticket they
sent me, to anybody who looked at it

456
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:15,111
And then came the night
before I was supposed to leave,

457
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,822
And I just got so worried,

458
00:50:24,013 --> 00:50:26,515
About how bad I was
going to do up there

459
00:50:27,013 --> 00:50:28,968
With all those smart kids

460
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,488
So I went out of my way

461
00:50:35,844 --> 00:50:38,928
To get just pissed wasted, so bad that

462
00:50:39,088 --> 00:50:41,810
There was no chance I was waking
up in in the morning.

463
00:50:44,915 --> 00:50:46,604
So I missed the bus

464
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,017
I didn't buy a ticket for the next one

465
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,844
Or the one after that.

466
00:50:57,208 --> 00:50:59,484
Well, if you'd gone,
you might be dead now.

467
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,222
Well, lucky me, right?

468
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,733
Lucky us.

469
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,484
A few, a few years ago,

470
00:51:14,808 --> 00:51:16,537
I was at a hardware store

471
00:51:17,822 --> 00:51:21,150
And there was this little girl,
with her Dad.

472
00:51:22,506 --> 00:51:25,008
And he was in a hurry,
and she wasn't keeping up.

473
00:51:26,262 --> 00:51:27,560
and he kept

474
00:51:28,715 --> 00:51:33,355
yanking on her arm,
really hard, you know.

475
00:51:35,044 --> 00:51:36,231
too hard.

476
00:51:40,551 --> 00:51:42,173
You know that feeling?

477
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:50,733
When my Dad got that way,
my brother Collin was always there.

478
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,084
To take the worst of it.
For me.

479
00:51:56,946 --> 00:52:00,160
And after seeing that little girl,
I thought maybe I could

480
00:52:00,928 --> 00:52:02,062
do that

481
00:52:03,124 --> 00:52:04,066
For her.

482
00:52:08,702 --> 00:52:10,391
But I just kept watching

483
00:52:12,982 --> 00:52:15,533
And they were about to leave,
and I'd done nothing.

484
00:52:18,493 --> 00:52:19,675
And,

485
00:52:20,377 --> 00:52:21,920
she slips

486
00:52:23,062 --> 00:52:25,462
And it throws him out off-balance
and he hits her

487
00:52:27,786 --> 00:52:30,417
And I wanted so badly to do something.

488
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,493
To help her, but

489
00:52:33,048 --> 00:52:35,537
I do what I always do
when things get hard

490
00:52:38,146 --> 00:52:40,337
I just panicked and ran.

491
00:52:45,755 --> 00:52:46,670
Look,

492
00:52:46,862 --> 00:52:50,026
We're here, we're alive.

493
00:52:51,515 --> 00:52:53,186
And that means something.

494
00:52:56,568 --> 00:52:57,791
got it?

495
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,315
You've got to be kidding me.

496
00:54:32,355 --> 00:54:33,410
What?

497
00:54:33,777 --> 00:54:35,497
We're missing pieces here.

498
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,071
Look at this poor cat.

499
00:54:38,231 --> 00:54:40,884
He's been deformed,
he's got one eye.

500
00:54:41,875 --> 00:54:44,240
About to go snorkling and
everything too.

501
00:54:46,426 --> 00:54:47,777
What are you doing?

502
00:54:53,973 --> 00:54:56,730
Ooh, cornering the market on
post-apocalyptic fashion, huh?

503
00:54:57,472 --> 00:54:59,940
Needs more axes and chainsaws.

504
00:54:59,995 --> 00:55:01,324
For what, she has a shotgun.

505
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,426
Yeah, what if up there it's like..

506
00:55:05,822 --> 00:55:08,008
- [???] tracks?
- Zombies.

507
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,173
Though even Howard doesn't think that one's possible.

508
00:55:12,404 --> 00:55:15,235
Though you should hear his theory
about mutant space-worms.

509
00:55:21,053 --> 00:55:22,591
What is that? Howard?

510
00:55:22,648 --> 00:55:24,613
Stay calm. We're okay.

511
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,115
- What was that?
- Quiet.

512
00:55:36,422 --> 00:55:38,337
That sounds like helicopters.

513
00:55:39,373 --> 00:55:42,368
Could be military.
But not ours.

514
00:55:43,146 --> 00:55:44,586
How can you tell?

515
00:55:44,817 --> 00:55:47,462
- 14 years in the Navy.
- What's happening up there?

516
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:53,128
My guess, those flashes that kicked
this all off,

517
00:55:53,435 --> 00:55:55,440
That was phase 1.

518
00:55:55,973 --> 00:56:00,000
Take out your opponent's population centers,
with big hits, all at once

519
00:56:00,906 --> 00:56:04,071
Fast.
And then for round 2.

520
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:06,000
Ground sweeps.

521
00:56:06,244 --> 00:56:10,080
The satellite log shows an
increase in coded traffic recently.

522
00:56:10,168 --> 00:56:12,780
Possibly extra-terrestrial signals.

523
00:56:12,973 --> 00:56:17,217
I bet what we just heard were air-borne
patrols sent to hunt down

524
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,146
the remaining signs of life.
Like us.

525
00:56:26,924 --> 00:56:29,848
Okay, oh boy..

526
00:56:29,946 --> 00:56:31,275
That's bad.

527
00:56:36,777 --> 00:56:38,537
And that's worse.

528
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,911
What was up there?

529
00:56:41,684 --> 00:56:43,666
Air filtration system.

530
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,475
I can't.. something is
blocking the hedge.

531
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:54,466
If we can't get it back up, we're
gonna run out of breathable air fast.

532
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:04,932
You're the only one
small enough to reach it.

533
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,734
Reach what?

534
00:57:06,777 --> 00:57:09,546
The filtration system.
Through there, the main duct.

535
00:57:09,648 --> 00:57:12,570
Someone needs to get in there
and re-start it.

536
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:17,666
Give me a hand.

537
00:57:18,093 --> 00:57:22,610
- Let me go in, she won't know her way around.
- You won't fit, plus your arm. She'll be fine.

538
00:57:23,337 --> 00:57:29,690
Now, to re-start the unit, you just
swing the handle off and on. Off and on.

539
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:32,457
That should do it.

540
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,502
And neither of us will be able
to go in and help you if you get stuck.

541
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,840
Don't get stuck.

542
00:58:25,057 --> 00:58:26,133
Michelle?

543
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:28,582
Everything okay up there?

544
00:58:30,285 --> 00:58:31,819
Looks like a dead end.

545
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,493
That's the incline.

546
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:36,662
Climb up that,
and you're almost there.

547
00:58:39,328 --> 00:58:40,453
Oh, this sucks.

548
01:00:19,193 --> 01:00:25,330
'HELP'

549
01:00:52,297 --> 01:00:53,435
What's wrong?

550
01:00:56,822 --> 01:00:58,982
He lied to you, he lied about Megan.

551
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:01,684
What do you mean?

552
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,080
I think he did something horrible to her.

553
01:01:05,906 --> 01:01:07,000
How?.

554
01:01:07,257 --> 01:01:09,791
His family moved to Chicago
years ago.

555
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:13,697
What's this?

556
01:01:16,728 --> 01:01:18,217
Is that blood?

557
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,506
Come with me.

558
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:30,506
Wait, is that..

559
01:01:30,786 --> 01:01:33,266
She went missing, two years back.

560
01:01:34,506 --> 01:01:37,560
It was on the news and everything.
Most people just thought she skipped town.

561
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,568
There is a message up there.

562
01:01:42,653 --> 01:01:46,151
It said 'HELP'. It was scratched on the inside of the window.

563
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,991
This earring was with it.

564
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:52,284
Did she ever show up, after she went missing?

565
01:01:56,466 --> 01:02:00,608
He said to me, he said to my face.
He said this is his daughter, he said this...

566
01:02:28,022 --> 01:02:29,831
He took her and he killed her.

567
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:38,831
I was just thinking,

568
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,955
Maybe we

569
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,404
take away his gun

570
01:02:43,631 --> 01:02:47,564
Tie him up, to confess. Whatever it is he's done
- What confess to who, the police?

571
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,568
Look, like I said,

572
01:02:51,284 --> 01:02:53,515
We can't be the only survivors, right?

573
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:58,528
- The woman, she was able to get
around a little, right? -- Yeah, till she died.

574
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,542
Directly above us, choking to death.

575
01:03:01,848 --> 01:03:03,164
[???]  Other people to save [???]

576
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,690
Now, that's a great example of teamwork.

577
01:03:06,427 --> 01:03:09,362
Very well done.
Feel like some music.

578
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,075
Problem solving always puts me
in a musical mood.

579
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,684
Michelle,

580
01:03:19,866 --> 01:03:22,066
You should go shower, just in case.

581
01:03:25,217 --> 01:03:26,137
Sure

582
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:51,130
<font color="#808080">[SOUNDTRACK]
The Exciters (Vonda Shepard) - Tell Him (1962)</font>

583
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,151
I think I might have an idea.

584
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,217
- '10 Better Ways to Style My Bangs'?
- No, not the article.  This.

585
01:04:15,946 --> 01:04:17,853
I think I can only make one.

586
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,524
But it's a start.

587
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:20,582
No kidding.

588
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:29,680
Hey, Howard

589
01:04:32,046 --> 01:04:34,047
What is this?
You're re-watching '16 Candles'?

590
01:04:34,146 --> 01:04:35,822
'Pretty in Pink'

591
01:04:36,471 --> 01:04:39,728
It was one of Megan's favorite movies.
Can I help you with something?

592
01:04:40,186 --> 01:04:43,253
No, no, I'm just grabbing some water.

593
01:05:17,555 --> 01:05:18,617
Say, ahmm,

594
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,204
You know, I was just thinking..

595
01:05:24,066 --> 01:05:26,524
Not, that I'm trying to tell
you how to run this place.

596
01:05:26,697 --> 01:05:28,355
But I am just,

597
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:30,604
a bit curious

598
01:05:32,573 --> 01:05:33,800
about Michelle

599
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:38,164
Say, how close do you think
she got to the air filtration unit?

600
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:39,742
You think she touched it?

601
01:05:40,047 --> 01:05:43,049
Yeah, I'm pretty sure she touched it.

602
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:49,017
Yeah, I know she cleaned up after, and
everything.. But I'm just thinking..

603
01:05:50,088 --> 01:05:53,146
Given that unit filter has
got god knows what from outside

604
01:05:53,213 --> 01:05:57,791
If she tracked anything back in with
her. It would be pretty concentrated

605
01:05:58,337 --> 01:05:59,060
And

606
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:03,370
Could be all over the shower,
and the sink, bathroom, right now.

607
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:08,364
Well, anyways, it's just a thought.

608
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:40,893
Not bad so far, partner.

609
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:43,382
If Howard find this, he's going
to kill us.

610
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:49,235
Alright, so, we get the gun away from him,

611
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:52,133
Tie him up, make sure
he isn't going anywhere.

612
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,848
And then one of us

613
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,177
just..

614
01:07:57,484 --> 01:07:59,257
Goes out, and looks for help.

615
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:15,066
Ahmm, first word..

616
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:18,320
tiny..

617
01:08:19,097 --> 01:08:20,835
Small, pygmie..

618
01:08:21,884 --> 01:08:23,120
- Little.
- Yup.

619
01:08:23,648 --> 01:08:24,910
Alright, ahh

620
01:08:25,066 --> 01:08:26,142
Second word,

621
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,631
Michelle, is a..

622
01:08:32,706 --> 01:08:33,591
ahmm, girl

623
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:37,537
hmm, a girl, a child

624
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,337
ahh, a girl.

625
01:08:43,693 --> 01:08:46,422
No, she's older, so she is a..

626
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:49,831
A little princess?

627
01:08:56,546 --> 01:08:57,604
ahh, No.  It was ..

628
01:08:58,324 --> 01:08:59,048
Woman.

629
01:08:59,675 --> 01:09:00,920
'Little Women'..

630
01:09:02,817 --> 01:09:03,626
Well,

631
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:04,924
a little woman,

632
01:09:10,195 --> 01:09:11,080
Next time,

633
01:09:11,142 --> 01:09:13,200
Try to be a little more .. specific.

634
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:31,702
I'm always watching

635
01:09:32,977 --> 01:09:33,817
Always.

636
01:09:43,173 --> 01:09:43,990
ahmm, god.

637
01:09:44,826 --> 01:09:46,860
I go wherever I want.

638
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:51,977
I mean, ah, I don't know.

639
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,537
I know what you're doing,
I see what you're doing.

640
01:09:58,124 --> 01:10:00,648
I know what you're up to.

641
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,057
Look, Howard.
I don't know what you're getting at,

642
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,191
I see when you're sleeping

643
01:10:06,253 --> 01:10:08,653
- I don't know, what...
- I know what you're doing,

644
01:10:08,706 --> 01:10:13,351
- ahh, I don't know..
- and I'm always watching. Always watching.

645
01:10:16,604 --> 01:10:17,982
Santa Claus.
You're Santa Claus.

646
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:23,262
Yeah, Michelle, that's great.

647
01:10:23,711 --> 01:10:26,008
Okay, except it was Emmett's turn.

648
01:10:26,382 --> 01:10:29,311
- Yeah, I got a little excited...
- well, I'm keeping that point.

649
01:10:30,524 --> 01:10:32,031
Totally, you earned it.

650
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:57,530
Emmett?

651
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,113
Hey,

652
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,355
I need your help with something.

653
01:11:20,621 --> 01:11:21,554
Sure.

654
01:11:27,226 --> 01:11:30,035
You.  On deck.

655
01:11:48,849 --> 01:11:49,983
What is this?

656
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:51,777
A barrel.

657
01:11:55,457 --> 01:11:57,226
Move it into the bathroom.

658
01:12:07,475 --> 01:12:09,860
This is sulphoric acid.

659
01:12:11,808 --> 01:12:13,635
Do either of you know what that is?

660
01:12:16,142 --> 01:12:18,013
It's usually produced

661
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:21,337
as a precursor to
ammonium proclorate.

662
01:12:22,262 --> 01:12:23,440
Fuel.

663
01:12:24,497 --> 01:12:27,450
Used to launch naval cell
like the ones in North Harvard.[???]

664
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,257
It's highly corrosive.

665
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,395
Dissolves most biological material on contact.

666
01:12:39,128 --> 01:12:40,595
With humans,

667
01:12:40,924 --> 01:12:43,355
Right down to the bone.

668
01:12:46,484 --> 01:12:47,884
Hey, Howard, ahh..

669
01:12:48,328 --> 01:12:50,257
What're you showing it
to us this for?

670
01:12:54,168 --> 01:12:55,724
You think I'm an idiot?

671
01:12:58,377 --> 01:13:01,057
Howard, please, you're going to have to
tell us what you're talking about.

672
01:13:01,111 --> 01:13:03,568
I'm talking about getting rid of some waste.

673
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:09,071
Tell me what you two
were doing with this.

674
01:13:15,315 --> 01:13:17,900
You tell me what you two were planning.
Right now!

675
01:13:17,951 --> 01:13:19,751
Take it easy, Calm down.

676
01:13:19,991 --> 01:13:21,900
- Howard, please.
- I'm giving you one chance.

677
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:26,968
Howard, just calm down.

678
01:13:27,013 --> 01:13:28,288
One chance!

679
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:31,133
to answer with some dignity or I swear to god

680
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,622
You're going into this barrel
while you're alive to feel it.

681
01:13:33,657 --> 01:13:34,422
It was me.

682
01:13:38,417 --> 01:13:40,150
Alright, not her, It was just me.

683
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,733
- No, no -- Stay out of this.
She doesn't have a clue

684
01:13:42,786 --> 01:13:43,831
what she's talking about.

685
01:13:44,648 --> 01:13:46,075
I wanted your gun.

686
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:49,466
And so I was,

687
01:13:50,262 --> 01:13:52,413
Thinking about making a weapon

688
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:54,702
To get it,

689
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,786
From you.

690
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:06,610
I want her to respect me,
the way she respects you.

691
01:14:10,435 --> 01:14:12,320
I'm not saying I was right, okay?

692
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:15,060
And I'm sorry.

693
01:14:19,853 --> 01:14:22,208
- You're sorry?
- I am sorry.

694
01:14:25,391 --> 01:14:27,115
I accept your apology.

695
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:47,290
He was going to hurt us.
He was going to hurt you.

696
01:14:47,355 --> 01:14:49,235
It's okay, this is okay.

697
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,764
This is the way it was always supposed to be.

698
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,930
You're safe now.

699
01:14:52,995 --> 01:14:54,930
Now, it's just you and me.

700
01:14:56,069 --> 01:14:57,270
It's okay.

701
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:01,000
Now, you should go to your room now.

702
01:15:01,909 --> 01:15:04,610
This is not part of anything
you need to see.

703
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:02,671
Michelle?

704
01:16:03,551 --> 01:16:04,111
Hey,

705
01:16:06,807 --> 01:16:09,575
I thought we'd change
things up tonight.

706
01:16:09,986 --> 01:16:12,031
And have dessert before dinner.

707
01:16:12,284 --> 01:16:14,822
After all, we can do
whatever we want now.

708
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:23,613
Would you like a cone or a bowl?

709
01:16:27,164 --> 01:16:29,040
Megan always wanted hers a bowl.

710
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:31,168
the cones are too messy.

711
01:16:33,866 --> 01:16:36,730
I know this is not the life you prefer.

712
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:40,795
And it isn't easy for
you living down here.

713
01:16:41,448 --> 01:16:44,111
But I want us to be a happy family.

714
01:16:44,546 --> 01:16:45,622
You and me.

715
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:50,973
The mess is all taken care of.

716
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:55,266
So, just hang loose, and
I'll go get dinner started.

717
01:18:00,897 --> 01:18:02,311
Everything alright?

718
01:18:03,457 --> 01:18:05,350
Yeah, I was just about to do some reading.

719
01:18:10,711 --> 01:18:12,404
It's time to set the table.

720
01:18:13,533 --> 01:18:14,951
Supper is ready.

721
01:18:17,582 --> 01:18:19,995
- Yeah.
- Okay.

722
01:18:32,066 --> 01:18:33,850
Keeps doing that.
I don't know why.

723
01:18:47,173 --> 01:18:49,813
Michelle,
Why is this loose?

724
01:18:54,253 --> 01:18:55,270
Get up.

725
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,533
- Why?
- Get up.

726
01:18:57,728 --> 01:18:59,453
Get off the matress.
Now!

727
01:19:04,955 --> 01:19:05,862
Oh, shit.

728
01:19:30,088 --> 01:19:31,688
You're going to walk out on me?

729
01:19:34,831 --> 01:19:36,310
After I saved you?

730
01:19:36,466 --> 01:19:38,026
And kept you safe?

731
01:19:38,118 --> 01:19:39,785
This is how you re-pay me?

732
01:19:41,608 --> 01:19:42,480
No

733
01:19:44,155 --> 01:19:45,333
This is.

734
01:21:25,659 --> 01:21:27,126
Michelle!

735
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,942
You don't know what's out there.

736
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:57,950
You can't run from them.

737
01:21:59,226 --> 01:22:00,893
Stay with me.

738
01:27:39,111 --> 01:27:40,460
Come on.

739
01:30:47,982 --> 01:30:50,420
Help!  I'm out here, help!

740
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,106
Oh, fuck.

741
01:35:28,262 --> 01:35:32,026
<i>But if you have any medical training</i>
<i>Or combat experience</i>

<i>There are survivors in Mercy Hospital</i>

745

01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,102

749
