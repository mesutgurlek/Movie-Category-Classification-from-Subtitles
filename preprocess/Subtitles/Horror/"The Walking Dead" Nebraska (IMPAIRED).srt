00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,938
I got better things to do.

320
00:26:22,939 --> 00:26:24,740
What's the matter with you?

321
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:26,676
Don't you be so selfish.

322
00:26:26,677 --> 00:26:29,178
Selfish?
Listen to me, Olive Oyl.

323
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:31,980
I was out there looking for that
little girl every single day.

324
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:34,316
I took a bullet
and an arrow in the process.

325
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:37,852
Don't you tell me about
me getting my hands dirty!

326
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:41,356
You want those two idiots?
Have a nice ride.

327
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:43,425
I'm done looking for people.

328
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:04,611
Hershel.

329
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:08,180
Who's with you?

330
00:27:08,181 --> 00:27:09,882
Glenn.

331
00:27:12,286 --> 00:27:14,354
Maggie sent him?

332
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:16,322
He volunteered.

333
00:27:16,323 --> 00:27:18,491
He's good like that.

334
00:27:29,835 --> 00:27:33,372
- How many ha you had?
- Not enough.

335
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:38,909
Let's finish this up back at home.

336
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,412
Beth collapsed,

337
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:44,515
is in some sort of state.

338
00:27:44,516 --> 00:27:47,685
Must be in shock.
I think you are too.

339
00:27:48,853 --> 00:27:50,488
Maggie's with her?

340
00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:53,490
<i>Yeah, but Beth needs you.</i>

341
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:55,659
What could I do?

342
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,894
She needs her mother.

343
00:27:57,895 --> 00:28:00,096
Or rather to mourn

344
00:28:01,031 --> 00:28:03,667
like she should've done weeks ago.

345
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:06,603
I robbed her of that.

346
00:28:07,838 --> 00:28:09,605
I see that now.

347
00:28:11,841 --> 00:28:14,109
You thought there was a cure.

348
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,446
Can't blame yourself
for holding out for hope.

349
00:28:18,581 --> 00:28:20,382
Hope?

350
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,321
When I first saw you
running across my field

351
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:28,423
with your boy in your arms,

352
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:32,593
I had little hope he would survive.

353
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:34,495
But he did.

354
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:36,897
He did.

355
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:39,033
Even though we lost Otis.

356
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:42,502
Your man Shane made it back

357
00:28:42,503 --> 00:28:46,139
and we saved your boy.

358
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,210
That was the miracle that
proved to me miracles do exist.

359
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:56,582
Only it was a sham, a bait and switch.

360
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:05,991
I was a fool, Rick,
and you people saw that.

361
00:29:10,997 --> 00:29:13,965
My daughters deserve better than that.

362
00:30:00,543 --> 00:30:02,143
- (Gasps)
- <i>(Tires screeching)</i>

363
00:30:02,144 --> 00:30:03,879

364
00:30:05,314 --> 00:30:06,915
(Screams)

365
00:30:21,483 --> 00:30:23,584
So what do we do?
Just wait for him to pass out?

366
00:30:23,585 --> 00:30:25,353
Just go.

367
00:30:26,655 --> 00:30:28,723
Just go!

368
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:31,359
I promised Maggie
I'd bring you home safe.

369
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,696
(Chuckles) Like you
promised that little girl?

370
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,034
So what's your plan?
Finish that bottle?

371
00:30:41,035 --> 00:30:43,371
Drink yourself to death
and leave your girls alone?

372
00:30:43,372 --> 00:30:45,005
- <i>(Glass thuds)</i>
<i>- Stop telling me</i>

373
00:30:45,006 --> 00:30:47,708
how to care for my family, my farm.

374
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:50,444
You people are like a plague!

375
00:30:50,445 --> 00:30:53,480
I do the Christian thing,
give you shelter,

376
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:55,982
and you destroy it all!

377
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:58,551
The world was already
in bad shape when we met.

378
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:00,687
And you take no responsibility!

379
00:31:00,688 --> 00:31:02,555
You're supposed to be their leader!

380
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:05,558
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?

381
00:31:08,795 --> 00:31:10,596
Yes.

382
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:15,868
Yes.

383
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:18,036
Yes, you are.

384
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:28,846
Now come on.

385
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:31,849
Your girls need you now
more than ever.

386
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,787
I didn't want to believe you.

387
00:31:35,788 --> 00:31:37,855
You told me there was no cure,

388
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:40,457
that these people were dead, not sick.

389
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:43,259
I chose not to believe that.

390
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,129
But when Shane shot Lou in the chest

391
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,064
and she just kept coming,

392
00:31:48,065 --> 00:31:51,167
that's when I knew
what an ass I'd been,

393
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:55,138
that Annette had been dead long ago

394
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:57,339
and I was feeding a rotten corpse!

395
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,142
That's when I knew there was no hope.

396
00:32:01,845 --> 00:32:05,881
And when that little girl
came out of the barn,

397
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,618
the look on your face--

398
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:11,787
I knew you knew it too.

399
00:32:13,957 --> 00:32:15,623
Right?

400
00:32:15,624 --> 00:32:17,592
There is no hope.

401
00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:22,364
And you know it now, like I do.

402
00:32:23,732 --> 00:32:25,434
Don't you?

403
00:32:30,505 --> 00:32:34,041
There is no hope for any of us.

404
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:39,246
- (Panting)
- <i>(Bird cawing)</i>

405
00:33:05,972 --> 00:33:08,073
- You ready?
- Yeah.

406
00:33:09,476 --> 00:33:12,044
Man, how many times
we gonna have to do this?

407
00:33:15,448 --> 00:33:18,549
Look, I'm done.
I'm not doing this anymore,

408
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,519
cleaning up after you.
You know what the truth is?

409
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,188
Nothing has changed.

410
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:27,425
Death is death.
It's always been there,

411
00:33:27,426 --> 00:33:29,627
whether it's from
a heart attack, cancer,

412
00:33:29,628 --> 00:33:32,196
or a walker.
What's the difference?

413
00:33:32,197 --> 00:33:34,732
You didn't think it was
hopeless before, did you?

414
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:38,502
Now there are people back at home
trying to hang on. They need us,

415
00:33:38,503 --> 00:33:40,971
even if it's just to give
them a reason to go on,

416
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:43,073
even if we don't believe it ourselves.

417
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:47,511
You know what?
This-- this isn't about

418
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:49,746
what we believe anymore.

419
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:52,882
It's about them.

420
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:05,028
(Door opens)

421
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:11,934
Son of a bitch.
They're alive.

422
00:34:20,132 --> 00:34:22,099
I'm Dave.

423
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,402
That scrawny-looking
douche bag there is Tony.

424
00:34:24,403 --> 00:34:27,538
- (Chuckles) Eat me, Dave.
- Hey, maybe someday I will.

425
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:30,307
We met on I-95
coming out of Philly.

426
00:34:30,308 --> 00:34:32,108
Damn shit-show that was.

427
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:35,912
I'm Glenn. It's nice
to meet some new people.

428
00:34:35,913 --> 00:34:37,448
Rick Grimes.

429
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:42,085
- How about you, pal? Have one?
- I just quit.

430
00:34:42,086 --> 00:34:44,286
You've got a unique sense
of timing, my friend.

431
00:34:44,287 --> 00:34:48,123
His name's Hershel.
He lost people today, a lot of them.

432
00:34:49,526 --> 00:34:51,861
I'm truly sorry to hear that.

433
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,765
To better days and new friends.

434
00:34:55,766 --> 00:34:57,933
And to our dead--

435
00:34:57,934 --> 00:35:00,168
May they be in a better place.

436
00:35:02,938 --> 00:35:05,940
Ah. Ah.

437
00:35:09,945 --> 00:35:11,680
Not bad, huh?

438
00:35:14,049 --> 00:35:15,851
I got it off a cop.

439
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:19,387
- I'm a cop.
- This one was already dead.

440
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:25,193
You fellas are a long way
from Philadelphia.

441
00:35:25,194 --> 00:35:28,129
- It feels like we're a long way from anywhere.
- Well, what drove you south?

442
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,730
Well, I can tell you
it wasn't the weather.

443
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:32,266
I must've dropped 30 lbs.
In sweat alone down here.

444
00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:35,369
- I wish.
- Dave: No, first it was D.C.

445
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,337
I heard there might be
some kind of refugee camp,

446
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:40,473
but the roads were so jammed,
we never even got close.

447
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:43,310
We decided to get off the
highways, into the sticks,

448
00:35:43,311 --> 00:35:45,512
keep hauling ass.

449
00:35:45,513 --> 00:35:48,948
Every group we came across had a new
rumor about a way out of this thing.

450
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:50,917
One guy told us there was the
coast guard sitting in the gulf,

451
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:52,684
sending ferries to the islands.

452
00:35:52,685 --> 00:35:54,686
Dave: <i>The latest was a
rail yard in Montgomery</i>

453
00:35:54,687 --> 00:35:56,355
running trains to the
middle of the country--

454
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:58,958
- Kansas, Nebraska.
- Nebraska?

455
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,927
Low population, lots of guns.

456
00:36:00,928 --> 00:36:03,695
- Kinda makes sense.
- Dave: <i>Ever been to Nebraska, kid?</i>

457
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:07,098
A reason they call 'em Flyover States.

458
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:09,901
<i>(Tony laughs)</i>

459
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:15,506
How about you guys?

460
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,608
Fort Benning, eventually.

461
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:21,645
I hate to piss in your
cornflakes, officer, but...

462
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:25,049
We ran across a grunt
who was stationed at Benning.

463
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,451
He said the place
was overrun by lamebrains.

464
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:30,287
Wait, Fort Benning is gone?
Are you for real?

465
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,956
Dave:
<i>Sadly, I am.</i>

466
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,327
Oddly, the truth is there is
no way out of this mess.

467
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,396
<i>Just keep going from one
pipe dream to the next,</i>

468
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:42,365
praying one of these mindless freaks

469
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,101
- doesn't grab a hold of you when you sleep.
- Tony: If you sleep.

470
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:48,137
Yeah, it doesn't look like you
guys are hanging your hats here.

471
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:50,607
You holed up somewhere else?

472
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:54,977
Not really.

473
00:36:57,581 --> 00:36:59,114
Those your cars out front?

474
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:01,650
Yeah. Why?

475
00:37:01,651 --> 00:37:03,185
We're living in ours.

476
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:06,689
Those look kinda empty, clean.

477
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,791
- Where's all your gear?
- Hershel: <i>We're with a larger group</i>

478
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:13,194
out scouting, thought
we could use a drink.

479
00:37:13,195 --> 00:37:15,797
A drink? Hershel,
I thought you quit.

480
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,201
Well, we're thinking
of setting up around here.

481
00:37:20,202 --> 00:37:23,204
- Is it-- is it safe?
- Glenn: <i>It can be,</i>

482
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:27,273
although I have killed a
couple of walkers around here.

483
00:37:27,274 --> 00:37:29,075
Walkers?
That what you call them?

484
00:37:29,076 --> 00:37:31,610
- (Glenn chuckles) Yeah.
- That's good.

485
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,372
I like that.
I like that better than lamebrains.

486
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:35,448
Tony:
More succinct.

487
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:38,652
- Okay, Tony went to college.
- Two years.

488
00:37:47,728 --> 00:37:49,629
So what-- so what,
you guys set up

489
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,531
on the outskirts or something?

490
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:54,600
- That new development?
- Trailer park or something?

491
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:57,068
A farm?

492
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:59,771
? Old McDonald had a farm?

493
00:37:59,772 --> 00:38:03,041
- <i>(Tony chuckles)</i>
<i>- You got a farm?</i>

494
00:38:05,377 --> 00:38:09,514
- <i>(Urine pattering)</i>
<i>-? E-i-e-i-o?</i>

495
00:38:12,684 --> 00:38:14,919
- Tony: <i>Is it safe?</i>
<i>- Dave: It's gotta be.</i>

496
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,387
- You got food, water?
- Tony: <i>You got booze?</i>

497
00:38:17,388 --> 00:38:19,189
Ain't had a piece of ass in weeks.

498
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,724
- (Chuckles)
- Listen, pardon my friend.

499
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:22,693
City kids--
they got no tact.

500
00:38:22,694 --> 00:38:24,394
No disrespect.

501
00:38:25,697 --> 00:38:28,565
- So listen, Glenn--
- We've said enough.

502
00:38:28,566 --> 00:38:31,500
Well, hang on a second.
This farm-- it sounds pretty sweet.

503
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:34,037
- Don't it sound sweet, Tony?
- Tony: <i>Yeah, real sweet.</i>

504
00:38:34,038 --> 00:38:37,506
Dave: How about a little
southern hospitality?

505
00:38:37,507 --> 00:38:41,277
We got some buddies back at camp,
been having a real hard time.

506
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:44,080
I don't see why you can't
make room for a few more.

507
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:45,781
We can pool our resources,
our manpower.

508
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:48,016
Look, I'm sorry.
That's not an option.

509
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,357
Doesn't sound like it'd be a problem.

510
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:57,859
I'm sorry. We can't.

511
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,028
We can't take in any more.

512
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:03,130
(Chuckles)

513
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:05,099
You guys are something else.

514
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,202
I thought-- I thought
we were friends.

515
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,974
We got people
we gotta look out for too.

516
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:16,776
- We don't know anything about you.
- Dave: No, that's true.

517
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:22,448
You don't know anything about us.

518
00:39:22,449 --> 00:39:25,118
You don't know what we've had
to go through out there,

519
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:28,788
the things we've had to do.

520
00:39:31,525 --> 00:39:34,159
I bet you've had to do some of
those same things yourself.

521
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,061
Am I right?

522
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:43,836
'Cause ain't nobody's hands clean
in what's left of this world.

523
00:39:43,837 --> 00:39:46,438
We're all the same.

524
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,907
So come on, let's--

525
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:52,610
let's take a nice friendly
hayride to this farm

526
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:54,746
and we'll get to know each other.

527
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,283
That's not gonna happen.

528
00:39:59,284 --> 00:40:00,885
- Dave: Rick--
- Tony: This is bullshit.

529
00:40:00,886 --> 00:40:03,187
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

530
00:40:03,188 --> 00:40:05,221
- Don't ever tell me to calm down.
- Glenn: Whoa.

531
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:07,791
I'll shoot you three assholes in
the head and take your damn farm!

532
00:40:07,792 --> 00:40:10,694
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa. Relax.

533
00:40:10,695 --> 00:40:13,229
Take it easy.
Nobody's killing anybody.

534
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,999
Nobody's shooting anybody.
Right, Rick?

535
00:40:21,038 --> 00:40:23,105
Look.

536
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:27,910
We're just friends having a drink.
That's all.

537
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:32,948
Now where's the good stuff, huh?

538
00:40:32,949 --> 00:40:36,152
Good stuff, good stuff,
good stuff. Let's see.

539
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,488
Hey, look at that.

540
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:42,190
That'll work.

541
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:45,827
(Inhales deeply, sighs)

542
00:40:45,828 --> 00:40:48,663
You gotta understand--

543
00:40:48,664 --> 00:40:50,498
We can't stay out there.

544
00:40:52,168 --> 00:40:53,934
You know what it's like.

545
00:40:53,935 --> 00:40:56,203
Yeah, I do.

546
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,906
But the farm is too crowded as is.

547
00:40:58,907 --> 00:41:01,842
I'm sorry. You'll have to keep looking.

548
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:03,410
Keep looking.

549
00:41:03,411 --> 00:41:06,413
Where do you suggest we do that?

550
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:10,149
I don't know.

551
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:12,985
I hear Nebraska's nice.

552
00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:16,589
Nebraska.

553
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:19,525
This guy.

554

<i>(Gun cocks, fires)</i>

555
00:41:26,665 --> 00:41:28,734
<i>(Body thuds)</i>

556
00:41:34,673 --> 00:41:36,608
<i>(Rock music playing)</i>

557
00:41:45,483 --> 00:41:47,351

558
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:12,675
(Gun clicks, holstered)

559
00:42:12,676 --> 00:42:17,045
? Oh, I see that lantern?

560
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:19,081
<i>? trimmed low?</i>

561
00:42:19,082 --> 00:42:22,617
<i>? burning in our home?</i>

562
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:31,192
<i>? and though I feel like crying?</i>

563
00:42:31,193 --> 00:42:33,795
<i>? I swear tonight?</i>
