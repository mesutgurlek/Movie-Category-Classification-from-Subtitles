They ought to make the day the time
changes the first day of summer.

102
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,055
What?

103
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:26,316
Well, it's eight o'clock
and it's still light.

104
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:29,162
A lot of good
the extra daylight does us.

105
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:30,920
Now we've still got
a three-hour drive back.

106
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:32,930
We're not going to be home
until after midnight.

107
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:35,692
Well, if it really bugged you,
Johnny, you wouldn't do it.

108
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:38,581
You think I wanna blow Sunday
on a scene like this?

109
00:02:38,665 --> 00:02:40,758
You know, I figure we're either
gonna have to move mother out here,

110
00:02:40,883 --> 00:02:43,395
or move the grave into Pittsburgh.

111
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,488
She can't make
a trip like this.

112
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:47,748
I don't know that she can't.

113
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,809
- Is there any candy left?
- No.

114
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:54,571
Look at this thing.
"We still remember. "

115
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:57,167
I don't. You know,
I don't even remember what the man I

116
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:58,967
Johnny, it takes you five minutes.

117
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:04,073
5 minutes to put the wreath on the grave
and 6 hours to drive back and forth.

118
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:06,376
Mother wants to remember,
so we trot 200 miles into the count

119
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,469
and she stays at home.

120
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:10,436
Well, we're here, John, all right?

121
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:20,650
Radio: Testing... back on...
Ah, ladies and... We're coming back

122
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:23,162
on the air after an interruption
due to technical problem...

123
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:38,692
There's nothing wrong with the radio.
Must've been the station.

124
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:41,036
Which row is it in?

125
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:03,347
There's no one around.

126
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,235
Well, it's late.
If you'd gotten up earlier...

127
00:04:06,277 --> 00:04:09,165
Oh, look, I already lost
an hour's sleep in the time change.

128
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,305
I think you complain
just to hear yourself talk.

129
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,022
There it is.

130
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:32,607
I wonder what happened
to the one from last year.

131
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:35,997
Each year we spend
good money on these things.

132
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:38,677
We come out here, and the
one from last year is gone.

133
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:40,644
Well, the flowers die,

134
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,449
And the caretaker
or somebody takes them away.

135
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:47,006
Yeah, a little spit and polish,

136
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,304
he can clean this up sell it next year.

137
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:51,611
Wonder how many times
we bought the same one?

138
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:11,704
Hey, come on, Barb,
church was this morning, huh?

139
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:34,978
Hey, I mean,
praying's for church, huh? Come on.

140
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:38,034
I haven't seen you
in church lately.

141
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,178
Well, there's not much
sense in my going to church.

142
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:46,448
Do you remember one time
when we were small, we were out here?

143
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:48,457
It was from right over there.

144
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,466
I jumped out at you
from behind the tree

145
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,229
And grandpa got all excited, and
he shook his fist at me, and he said,

146
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:55,615
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell. "

147
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,461
Remember that?
Right over there.

148
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,303
Well, you used
to really be scared here.

149
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:03,276
Johnny.

150
00:06:03,694 --> 00:06:07,168
- Well, you're still afraid.
- Stop it now. I mean it.

151
00:06:10,852 --> 00:06:14,117
They're coming to get you, Barbra.

152
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,054
Stop it. You're ignorant.

153
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:19,350
They're coming for you, Barbra.

154
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:22,405
Stop it. You're acting like a child.

155
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,289
They're coming for you.

156
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,596
Look! There comes one of them now.

157
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:31,279
- He'll hear you.
- Here he comes. I getting out of here.

158
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:32,536
Johnny!

159
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,507
Johnny!

160
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:46,349
Help me!

161
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,500
It's all right.

162
00:13:59,598 --> 00:14:01,733
Don't worry about him.
I can handle him.

163
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:04,831
Probably be a lot more of them
as soon as they find out about us.

164
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,602
Truck is outta gas.

165
00:14:09,686 --> 00:14:11,696
This pump out here is locked.
Is there a key?

166
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:16,635
We can try to get out of here
if we can get some gas. Is there a key?

167
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:28,691
I suppose you've tried this.

168
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:39,784
Do you live here?

169
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:04,858
We've gotta get out of here.

170
00:15:04,983 --> 00:15:07,160
We have to get where there
are some other people.

171
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:13,021
Maybe we better take some food.

172
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:17,249
I'll see if I can find some food.

173
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:03,797
- What's happening?
- I'll be just a second.

174
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:05,261
What's happening?

175
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:20,289
Two of them.

176
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:28,578
There are two of them out there.
Have you seen any more around here?

177
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:30,754
I can take care of those two.

178
00:16:30,796 --> 00:16:33,349
- I know you're afraid, but we have to...
- I don't know! I don't know!

179
00:16:33,384 --> 00:16:35,443
What's happening?

180
00:18:56,342 --> 00:18:57,766
They know we're in here now.

181
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:14,426
Don't look at it.

182
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:29,941
Get some more lights on in this house.

183
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:11,006
Why don't you see if you can find
some wood, some boards,

184
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:13,099
something there by the fireplace,
Something we can nail this place up?

185
00:21:17,871 --> 00:21:19,126
Well, goddamn...

186
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:26,369
Look. I know you're afraid.
I'm afraid too.

187
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,891
But we have to try
to board the house up together.

188
00:21:29,926 --> 00:21:32,521
Now, I'm going to board up the windows
and the doors. Do you understand?

189
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:35,208
We'll be all right here.

190
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:38,800
We'll be all right till someone comes to
rescue us. But we have to work together.

191
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:39,931
You'll have to help me.

192
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:43,237
Now I want you to go in and get
some wood so I can board the place up.

193
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:45,121
Ok?

194
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:47,424
Ok?

195
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:28,249
They're not that strong.

196
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:31,765
Here, I want you to pick out some nails.
Pick out the biggest ones you can find.

197
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:39,928
There, this room looks pretty secure.

198
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,909
If we have to, we can run in here
and board up the doors.

199
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,230
Won't be long before those things'll
be back, pounding their way in here.

200
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:54,788
They're afraid now.

201
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:59,351
They're afraid of fire.
I found that out.

202
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:15,551
You know a place back down the road
called Beekman's? Beekman's diner?

203
00:25:22,332 --> 00:25:25,346
Anyhow, that's where I found
that truck I have out there.

204
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:29,406
There's a radio in the truck.

205
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:32,797
I had jumped in to listen to it,

206
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,402
When a big gasoline truck came
screaming right across the road.

207
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:41,462
Well, there must have been
10-15 of those things chasing after it.

208
00:25:42,718 --> 00:25:44,644
Grabbing and holding on.

209
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,001
Now, I didn't see them at first.

210
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:54,773
I could just see that the truck
was moving in a funny way.

211
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:58,122
And those things
were catching up to it.

212
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:03,647
Truck went
right across the road.

213
00:26:04,485 --> 00:26:07,624
Slammed on my brakes to keep
from hitting it myself.

214
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:10,052
It went right through
the guard rail.

215
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:20,224
I guess... I guess the driver
must have cut off the road,

216
00:26:20,434 --> 00:26:23,573
into that gas station
by Beekman's diner.

217
00:26:23,992 --> 00:26:27,675
It went right through the billboard.
Ripped over a gas pump,

218
00:26:27,717 --> 00:26:28,645
and never stopped moving.

219
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,485
By now it's like a moving bonfire.

220
00:26:34,707 --> 00:26:38,350
Didn't know if the truck
was going to explode or what.

221
00:26:41,196 --> 00:26:45,089
I can still hear the man, screaming.

222
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:52,833
This thing is
just backing away from it.

223
00:26:54,465 --> 00:26:57,731
I look back at the diner to see

224
00:26:57,773 --> 00:27:00,075
If there was anyone there
who could help me.

225
00:27:02,586 --> 00:27:04,728
That was when I noticed that

226
00:27:04,763 --> 00:27:07,191
The entire place
had been encircled.

227
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:12,130
Wasn't a sign of life left, except...

228
00:27:16,023 --> 00:27:18,200
by now, there were no more screams.

229
00:27:20,126 --> 00:27:22,261
I realized that...

230
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,281
I was alone.

231
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:26,531
With 50 or 60 of those things.

232
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:30,926
Just standing there,

233
00:27:31,804 --> 00:27:33,688
staring at me.

234
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,288
I started to drive. I...

235
00:27:38,753 --> 00:27:40,888
Just plowed right through them.

236
00:27:40,972 --> 00:27:42,730
They didn't move.

237
00:27:42,814 --> 00:27:48,507
They didn't run, or...
Just stood there, staring at me.

238
00:27:50,684 --> 00:27:52,944
Just wanted to crush them.

239
00:27:57,004 --> 00:28:01,357
They...
Scattered through the air, like bugs.

240
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:06,758
We were riding in the cemetery.

241
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:09,185
Johnny and me.

242
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:11,613
Johnny.

243
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:22,037
We... we came to put a wreath
on my father's grave.

244
00:28:24,088 --> 00:28:27,855
Johnny and...
and he said,

245
00:28:29,027 --> 00:28:31,999
"Can I have some candy, Barbra?"

246
00:28:35,012 --> 00:28:37,357
And we didn't have any.

247
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:41,417
And...

248
00:28:46,147 --> 00:28:47,445
Oh, it's hot in here.

249
00:28:48,115 --> 00:28:49,203
Hot...

250
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:58,726
And he said, "Oh, it's late. "

251
00:28:58,761 --> 00:29:01,301
"Why did we start so late?"

252
00:29:01,845 --> 00:29:04,113
And I said, "Johnny,

253
00:29:04,148 --> 00:29:06,868
"if you'd gotten up earlier,

254
00:29:06,903 --> 00:29:08,710
"we wouldn't be late. "

255
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,854
Johnny asked me if I were afraid.

256
00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:16,287
And I said, "I'm not afraid, Johnny. "

257
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:21,980
And then this man
started walking up the road.

258
00:29:23,612 --> 00:29:27,631
He came slowly, and Johnny
kept teasing me and saying,

259
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:30,896
"He's coming to get you, Barbra. "

260
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:33,993
And I laughed at him, and said,
"Johnny, stop it. "

261
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:38,556
And then Johnny ran away.

262
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,942
And I went up to this man,

263
00:29:40,977 --> 00:29:43,244
and I was going to apologize,

264
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:46,594
Why don't you just keep calm?

265
00:29:46,635 --> 00:29:50,486
And I looked up,
and I said, "Good eve... "

266
00:29:51,993 --> 00:29:53,458
And he grabbed me!

267
00:29:54,714 --> 00:29:58,481
He grabbed me!
And he ripped at me!

268
00:29:58,774 --> 00:30:02,082
He held me and he ripped
at my clothes!

269
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:04,468
I think you should just calm down.

270
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:09,114
Oh, I screamed,
"Johnny! Johnny, help me! Oh, help me!"

271
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:12,504
And he wouldn't let me go.
He ripped...

272
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,281
And then Johnny came and he ran

273
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:21,671
And he... he fought this man,

274
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:25,397
And I got so afraid I ran.

275
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:27,197
I ran... I ran...

276
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:33,937
And Johnny didn't come.

277
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:38,458
We've got...
we have to wait for Johnny.

278
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,746
Maybe... we'd better go out
and get him.

279
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:50,345
We have to go out and get Johnny.

280
00:30:50,387 --> 00:30:51,894
He's out there.

281
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:56,959
Please, don't you hear me?
We've got to go out and get him.

282
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:02,109
Please!
We have got to go get Johnny!

283
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,536
Please help me!

284
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:09,894
Look, don't you know what's going on out
there? This is no Sunday school picnic.

285
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:12,287
Don't you understand?
My brother is alone.

286
00:31:12,322 --> 00:31:16,466
- Your brother is dead.
- No! My brother is not dead!

287
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:12,977
Radio: Because of the obvious threat
to untold numbers of citizens,

288
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:16,200
and because of the crisis
which is even now developing,

289
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:19,214
this radio station will remain
on the air, day and night.

290
00:32:19,507 --> 00:32:21,767
This station and hundreds of other
radio and TV stations

291
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:23,860
throughout this part of the country
are pooling their resources

292
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:29,051
Through an emergency network hookup
to keep you informed of all developments.

293
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:32,776
At this hour, we repeat,
these are the facts as we know them.

294
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,576
There is an epidemic of mass murder

295
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:37,675
being committed by a virtual army
of unidentified assassins.

296
00:32:37,842 --> 00:32:40,270
The murders are taking place
in villages, cities,

297
00:32:40,437 --> 00:32:45,376
Rural homes and suburbs with no apparent
pattern or reason for the slayings.

298
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:48,557
It seems to be a sudden,
general explosion of mass homicide.

299
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:51,411
We have some descriptions
of the assassins.

300
00:32:51,446 --> 00:32:54,271
Eyewitnesses say they are
ordinary looking people.

301
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:57,097
Some say they appear to be
in a kind of trance.

302
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:58,604
Others describe them as being...

303
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:14,594
So, at this point there is
no really authentic way for us

304
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,604
to say who or what to look for
and guard yourself against.

305
00:33:16,646 --> 00:33:20,539
...reaction of
law enforcement officials

306
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:24,641
is one of complete
bewilderment at this hour.

307
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:30,752
Police, sheriffs' deputies,
and emergency ambulances

308
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:32,803
are literally deluged
with calls for help

309
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:35,273
The scene can best be described
as mayhem.

310
00:33:35,308 --> 00:33:37,702
Mayors of Pittsburgh,
Philadelphia, and Miami,

311
00:33:37,744 --> 00:33:40,506
Along with the governors of several
eastern and midwestern states

312
00:33:40,841 --> 00:33:44,022
have indicated the national guard
may be mobilized at any moment,

313
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,278
but that has not happened as yet.

314
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:49,799
The only advice our reporters have been
able to get from official sources

315
00:33:49,834 --> 00:33:53,817
is for private citizens to stay
in their homes behind locked doors.

316
00:33:53,985 --> 00:33:56,461
Do not venture outside,
for any reason,

317
00:33:56,496 --> 00:33:58,296
until the nature of this crisis
has been determined

318
00:33:58,464 --> 00:34:01,519
and until we can advise
what course of action to take.

319
00:34:01,554 --> 00:34:04,283
Keep listening to radio and TV

320
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:07,589
for any special instructions
as this crisis develops further.

321
00:34:07,624 --> 00:34:10,812
Thousands of office and factory
workers are being urged

322
00:34:10,896 --> 00:34:12,696
to stay at their places of employment,

323
00:34:12,738 --> 00:34:15,291
not to make any attempt
to get to their homes.

324
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:18,354
However, in spite of this
urging and warning,

325
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,691
streets and highways are packed
with frantic people

326
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:24,375
trying to reach their families,
or apparently to flee just anywhere.

327
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:30,068
Repeat: The safest course of action at
this time is simply to stay where you...

328
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,586
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've just received word

329
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,839
that the president has called
a meeting of his cabinet

330
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,442
to deal with
the sudden epidemic of murder

331
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:57,988
which has seized the eastern
third of this nation.

332
00:34:58,023 --> 00:35:00,500
The meeting is scheduled
to convene within the hour.

333
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:02,970
Members of the presidential
cabinet will be joined

334
00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:06,863
by officials of the FBI and the joint
chiefs behind closed doors.

335
00:35:07,532 --> 00:35:09,667
A White House spokesman,
in announcing this conference,

336
00:35:09,709 --> 00:35:11,719
says there will be
an official announcement

337
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,770
as soon as possible
following that meeting.

338
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:16,239
This is the latest dispatch
just received in our newsroom.

339
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:21,388
Latest word also from national
press services in Washington, D.C.,

340
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:25,909
that the emergency presidential
conference which we've just mentioned

341
00:35:25,951 --> 00:35:29,593
Will include high-ranking scientists
from NASA.

342
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:43,490
Radio and TV stations across
the eastern part of the country

343
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,499
including the one
to which you are listening

344
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:48,638
have joined their facilities
in an emergency network

345
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,690
to bring you this news
as it develops.

346
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,369
We urge you to stay tuned
to radio and TV

347
00:35:53,453 --> 00:35:55,336
and to stay indoors at all costs.

348
00:35:56,927 --> 00:35:59,104
Late reports
reaching this newsroom

349
00:35:59,145 --> 00:36:01,155
tell of frightened people
seeking refuge

350
00:36:01,197 --> 00:36:03,206
in churches, schools
and government buildings.

351
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:04,971
Demanding shelter
and protection

352
00:36:05,006 --> 00:36:06,597
from the wholesale murder
which apparently

353
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:08,438
is engulfing
much of the nation.

354
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:11,787
Law enforcement officials
are at a loss to explain or,

355
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:13,755
even at this hour, even to theorize

356
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,974
about the reasons
for this wave of murder...

357
00:36:17,732 --> 00:36:23,090
Chief T.K. Dunmore of Camden, North
Carolina, is quoted as saying, quote,

358
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:27,736
"Tell the people, for God's sake,
to get off the streets. "

359
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,134
"Tell 'em to go home and lock
their doors and windows up tight. "

360
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:34,684
"We don't know what kind of murder-happy
characters we have here. " End quote.

361
00:36:36,108 --> 00:36:38,787
That's chief Dunmore of Camden,
North Carolina.

362
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:42,262
So far the only descriptions,
the only clues,

363
00:36:42,345 --> 00:36:46,447
anyone has of the killers
come from frightened witnesses.

364
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,665
These eyewitness accounts
variously describe

365
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:50,800
the murderers
as "ordinary looking people,"

366
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,475
"Misshapen monsters. "

367
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:54,575
"People who look
like they're in a trance. "

368
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,294
And "things that look like
people but act like animals. "

369
00:36:58,336 --> 00:37:00,931
Some eyewitnesses tell
of seeing victims

370
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:03,526
who look as though
they had been torn apart.

371
00:37:03,861 --> 00:37:08,047
This whole ghastly story
began developing two days ago

372
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:12,149
with the report of the slaying
of a family of seven...

373
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,326
Since then, reports
of some senseless killings

374
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,377
began snowballing
in a reign of terror

375
00:37:16,412 --> 00:37:17,256
which has hopscotched...

376
00:37:21,651 --> 00:37:23,660
...keep track of
the murder reports

377
00:37:23,695 --> 00:37:25,670
by the placing of markers on a map

378
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:27,554
seem to indicate
a general spreading

379
00:37:27,637 --> 00:37:31,154
from the extreme southeastern
and states north and west.

380
00:37:31,656 --> 00:37:33,414
Our newsmen,
who have been on the telephone

381
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:35,388
talking with officials
of other cities

382
00:37:35,423 --> 00:37:38,395
have determined that none
of this kind of mass murder

383
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,744
has yet been reported west of
the Mississippi river,

384
00:37:41,786 --> 00:37:44,926
except in the extreme
southeastern portion of Texas.

385
00:37:45,302 --> 00:37:46,935
Similar killings
have been reported

386
00:37:46,977 --> 00:37:48,734
around the Houston
and Galveston areas

387
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:49,830
but nothing like the...

388
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:51,372
I found a gun
and some bullets out there.

389
00:37:54,344 --> 00:37:55,432
Oh, and these.

390
00:38:03,553 --> 00:38:05,520
This place is boarded up
pretty solid now.

391
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:08,534
We ought to be all right here
for a while.

392
00:38:10,209 --> 00:38:12,176
We have a gun and bullets,

393
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,227
Food and the radio,

394
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:20,046
Sooner or later, someone's bound
to come and get us out.

395
00:38:21,594 --> 00:38:24,609
So again, we join
with law enforcement agencies

396
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,828
in urging you
to seek shelter in a building.

397
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:28,689
Lock the doors and windows
securely.

398
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,469
Hey, that's us.
We're doing all right.

399
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:32,478
Be cautious
of any suspicious strangers,

400
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,529
and keep tuned to your
radio and television

401
00:38:34,571 --> 00:38:35,750
for survival instructions

402
00:38:35,785 --> 00:38:38,046
and further details
of this continuing story.

403
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,929
Look, I don't know
if you're hearing me.

404
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:42,609
But I'm going upstairs now.

405
00:38:44,953 --> 00:38:47,422
If anything should try to break in,
I can hear it from up there.

406
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:49,222
I'll be down to take care of it.

407
00:38:51,399 --> 00:38:52,829
Everything is all right for now.

408
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:56,129
I'll be back to reinforce
the windows and doors later.

409
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:58,683
But you'll be all right
for now, ok?

410
00:39:01,194 --> 00:39:02,283
Ok?

411
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:07,599
Radio: Civil defense
officials in Cumberland

412
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:08,854
have told newsmen
that murder victims

413
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:13,878
show evidence of having been
partially devour by their murderers.

414
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:55,653
Consistent reports from witnesses
to the effect that people

415
00:39:55,689 --> 00:39:58,542
who acted
as though they were in a kind of trance

416
00:39:58,584 --> 00:40:00,307
were killing and eating
their victims.

417
00:40:00,342 --> 00:40:03,983
Prompted authorities to examine
the bodies of some of the victims.

418
00:40:04,018 --> 00:40:07,626
Medical authorities in Cumberland
have concluded that in all cases

419
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:11,937
the killers are eating the flesh
of the people they murdered.

420
00:40:12,272 --> 00:40:15,998
Repeating this latest bulletin just
received moments ago from Cumberland.

421
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:18,384
Civil defense authorities
have told newsmen

422
00:40:18,467 --> 00:40:20,435
that murder victims show evidence

423
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,365
of having been partially
devoured by their murderers.

424
00:40:23,407 --> 00:40:27,174
Medical examination of victims' bodies
shows conclusively that

425
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:30,230
the killers are eating the flesh
of the people they kill.

426
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:35,714
And so this incredible story
becomes more ghastly with each report.

427
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:37,939
It's difficult to imagine
such a thing actually happening

428
00:40:37,974 --> 00:40:41,657
but these are the reports we have been
receiving and passing on to you,

429
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:44,965
Reports which have been verified
as completely as is possible

430
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,597
in this confused situation.

431
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:02,588
- Hold it!
- Don't shoot. We're from town.

432
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,676
A radio!

433
00:41:04,681 --> 00:41:07,701
Radio: The Butler county sheriff
has verified that reports

434
00:41:07,736 --> 00:41:11,881
of murder victims being partially
eaten by their slayers is true.

435
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:17,071
How long you guys been down there?
I could've used some help up here.

436
00:41:17,113 --> 00:41:18,501
That's the cellar.
It's the safest place.

437
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:20,880
You mean you didn't hear the
racket we were making up here?

438
00:41:20,915 --> 00:41:22,932
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

439
00:41:22,973 --> 00:41:24,941
Could've been those things
for all we knew.

440
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,078
That girl was screaming.

441
00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:28,373
Surely you must know what
a girl screaming sounds like.

442
00:41:28,408 --> 00:41:29,462
Those things don't make any noise.

443
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:32,022
Anybody would know
somebody needed help.

444
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:34,610
Look, it's kind of hard to hear
what's going on from down there.

445
00:41:34,736 --> 00:41:36,954
We thought we could hear screams,
but for all we knew,

446
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:39,801
that could have meant those things
were in the house after her.

447
00:41:40,052 --> 00:41:43,024
- And you wouldn't come up and help?
- Well, if there were more...

448
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:45,285
The racket sounded like the
place was being ripped apart.

449
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:47,001
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

450
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:48,549
Now wait a minute.

451
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:51,186
You just got finished saying you
couldn't hear it from down there.

452
00:41:51,221 --> 00:41:53,573
Now you say it sounded like the
place was being ripped apart.

453
00:41:53,615 --> 00:41:55,917
It would be nice if you'd get
your story straight, man.

454
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:58,220
All right, now you tell me.

455
00:41:59,015 --> 00:42:02,154
I'm not going to take that kind of a
chance when we've got a safe place.

456
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:04,833
We luck into a safe place,
and you're telling us

457
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:08,098
we've gotta risk our lives just because
somebody might need help, huh?

458
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:11,322
- Yeah. Something like that.
- All right, why don't we settle this...

459
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:12,368
Look, mister!

460
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,084
We came up, ok? We're here.

461
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:16,896
Now I suggest
we all go back downstairs

462
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:18,940
before any of those things
find out we're in here.

463
00:42:18,975 --> 00:42:20,280
They can't get in here.

464
00:42:20,531 --> 00:42:22,163
You got the whole place boarded up?

465
00:42:22,246 --> 00:42:23,000
Yeah, most of it.

466
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:26,223
All but a few spots upstairs.
They won't be hard to fix.

467
00:42:26,307 --> 00:42:29,238
You are insane.
The cellar's the safest place.

468
00:42:29,273 --> 00:42:31,044
I'm telling you,
they can't get in here.

469
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:34,093
And I'm telling you, those
things turned over our car.

470
00:42:34,128 --> 00:42:35,893
We were damned lucky
to get away at all.

471
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:39,869
Now you tell me those... things can't
get through this lousy pile of wood?

472
00:42:40,498 --> 00:42:44,014
His wife and kid's downstairs.
The kid's hurt.

473
00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:47,907
Well, I still think
we're better off up here.

474
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,297
We could strengthen
everything up, Mr. Cooper.

475
00:42:51,507 --> 00:42:54,019
With all of us working, we could
fix this place up in no time.

476
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,734
We have everything we need up here.

477
00:42:55,776 --> 00:42:58,539
We can take all that stuff
downstairs with us.

478
00:42:58,581 --> 00:43:00,171
Man, you're really crazy,
you know that?

479
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,678
You got a million windows
up here.

480
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,018
All these windows.
You're gonna...

481
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:05,739
You're gonna make 'em strong enough
to keep these things out, huh?

482
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:07,414
I told you, those things
don't have any strength.

483
00:43:07,497 --> 00:43:10,134
I smashed three of them
and pushed another one out the door.

484
00:43:10,218 --> 00:43:13,818
Did you hear me, what I told you?
They turned over our car.

485
00:43:13,902 --> 00:43:15,701
Oh hell,
any good five men can do that.

486
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:16,916
That's my point...

487
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:19,009
Only there's not going to be
five, or even ten.

488
00:43:19,051 --> 00:43:21,939
There's gonna be twenty, thirty,
maybe a hundred of those things.

489
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,118
And as soon as they know we're here,

490
00:43:23,153 --> 00:43:24,576
this place
is gonna be crawling with them.

491
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:27,883
Well, if there're that many, they'll
probably get us wherever we are.

492
00:43:28,552 --> 00:43:30,729
Look, the cellar.

493
00:43:31,064 --> 00:43:32,697
The cellar.
There's only one door, right?

494
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:35,585
Just one door.
That's all we have to protect.

495
00:43:35,627 --> 00:43:38,809
Tom and I fixed it so it locks
and boards from the inside.

496
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,273
But up here, all these windows,

497
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,869
Why, we'd never know where
they were gonna hit us next.

498
00:43:42,904 --> 00:43:44,292
You got a point, Mr. Cooper.

499
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:47,223
But down in the cellar,
there's no place to run to.

500
00:43:47,515 --> 00:43:50,906
I mean, if they did get in, there'd be
no back exit. We'd be done for.

501
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,711
We can get out of here
if we have to.

502
00:43:53,753 --> 00:43:57,059
And we got windows
to see what's going on outside.

503
00:43:57,436 --> 00:43:59,201
But down there, with no windows,

504
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,538
if a rescue party did come,
we wouldn't even know it.

505
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:03,966
But the cellar
is the strongest place.

506
00:44:04,001 --> 00:44:05,557
The cellar is a death trap.

507
00:44:05,724 --> 00:44:09,325
I don't know, Mr. Cooper.
I think he's right.

508
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:11,752
You know how many's out there?

509
00:44:11,794 --> 00:44:13,468
I don't know,
I figure maybe six or seven.

510
00:44:13,678 --> 00:44:17,194
Look. You two can do
whatever you like.

511
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:21,003
I'm going back down to the cellar
and you better decide,

512
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:23,222
'cause I'm gonna board up that door,

513
00:44:23,306 --> 00:44:25,440
and I'm not gonna unlock it
again no matter what happens.

514
00:44:25,482 --> 00:44:26,863
Now wait a minute, Mr. Cooper.

515
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:29,961
No, I'm not gonna wait! I've made
my decision, now you make yours.

516
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:32,556
Now wait a minute!
Let's think about this.

517
00:44:32,891 --> 00:44:34,859
We can make it to the cellar
if we have to.

518
00:44:35,361 --> 00:44:38,919
And if we do decide to stay down there,
We'll need some things from up here.

519
00:44:38,961 --> 00:44:41,473
So let's at least
consider this a while.

520
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:46,788
If you box yourself in the cellar

521
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,216
and those things get in
the house, you've had it.

522
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:51,519
At least up here,
you have a fighting chance.

523
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:57,714
Yeah, looks like about
eight or ten of them now.

524
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,733
That's more than there were.
There're a lot out back, too.

525
00:45:44,304 --> 00:45:47,318
Harry?
Harry, what's happening?

526
00:45:47,353 --> 00:45:48,615
It's all right!

527
00:46:03,392 --> 00:46:04,564
Now take it.

528
00:46:44,331 --> 00:46:45,754
We've gotta fix these boards.

529
00:46:46,591 --> 00:46:47,722
You're crazy!

530
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:50,736
Those things are gonna be at every
window and door in this place!

531
00:46:50,903 --> 00:46:52,326
We've got to get down
into the cellar.

532
00:46:52,452 --> 00:46:54,503
Go down into your damn cellar
and get out of here!

533
00:46:57,391 --> 00:46:59,700
- I'm... I'm taking the girl with me.
- You leave her here.

534
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:02,498
Keep your hands off her,
and everything else that's up here too.

535
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,136
Because if I stay up here,
I'm fighting for everything up here,

536
00:47:05,178 --> 00:47:07,605
and the radio and the food is
part of what I'm fighting for.

537
00:47:08,108 --> 00:47:09,908
Now if you're going down
in the cellar, get.

538
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,205
The man's insane.
He's insane.

539
00:47:12,879 --> 00:47:15,809
We've... we've got to have food
down there. We've got a right.

540
00:47:15,844 --> 00:47:17,651
- This your house?
- We've got a right.

541
00:47:17,986 --> 00:47:19,661
You going down there with him?

542
00:47:20,457 --> 00:47:23,679
Yes or no? This is your last chance.
No beating around the bush.

543
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:26,316
Listen, I got a kid down there.

544
00:47:26,818 --> 00:47:28,619
She can't possib...
I couldn't bring her up here.

545
00:47:28,702 --> 00:47:31,046
She can't possibly take
all the racket from those things

546
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,637
smashing through the windows.

547
00:47:32,672 --> 00:47:33,984
Well, you're her father.

548
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:37,075
If you're stupid enough to go die
in that trap, that's your business.

549
00:47:37,116 --> 00:47:39,502
However, I am not stupid enough
to follow you.

550
00:47:40,507 --> 00:47:43,019
It is tough for the kid
that her old man is so stupid.

551
00:47:43,312 --> 00:47:46,074
Now, get the hell down
in the cellar.

552
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,962
You can be the boss down there.
I'm boss up here.

553
00:47:51,014 --> 00:47:52,730
You bastards!

554
00:47:54,698 --> 00:47:57,586
You know, I won't open
this door again. I mean it.

555
00:47:57,837 --> 00:48:00,893
- Mr. Cooper, with your help...
- With my help.

556
00:48:00,935 --> 00:48:04,158
Let him go, man.
His mind is made up.

557
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:07,129
Wait a minute.

558
00:48:09,516 --> 00:48:11,357
Judy? Come on up here, honey.

559
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:20,483
You're gonna let them
get her too, huh?

560
00:48:20,944 --> 00:48:22,492
It's all right, honey.
Go ahead.

561
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:35,720
If we stick together, man,
we can fix it up real good.

562
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:38,902
There's lots of places
we can run to up here.

563
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:42,480
Mr. Cooper?
We'd all be a lot better off

564
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:45,223
if all three of us were working together.

565
00:48:48,153 --> 00:48:49,660
Hey.
Hey, kid.

566
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,580
He's wrong, you know.

567
00:49:00,501 --> 00:49:02,426
I'm not boxing myself in
down there.

568
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:11,762
Well, we're safe now.
It's boarded up tight.

569
00:49:14,064 --> 00:49:15,319
What about Tom and Judy?

570
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:17,120
They wanna stay up there.
Let 'em.

571
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,621
There are... two other people upstairs.
A man and a girl.

572
00:49:26,656 --> 00:49:28,296
We heard the screaming.

573
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,184
Yeah, but I didn't know
who they were,

574
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,445
and I wasn't about to take
any unnecessary chances.

575
00:49:33,486 --> 00:49:34,994
Of course not, Harry.

576
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:52,575
- Is she all right?
- I don't know what it is.

577
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:53,998
She feels warm.
Maybe it's shock.

578
00:49:54,793 --> 00:49:56,301
Where'd you get the bandage?

579
00:49:56,845 --> 00:50:00,318
Some laundry in the basket.
I tore a sheet.

580
00:50:07,896 --> 00:50:09,947
Let them stay upstairs.

581
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:11,998
Let them.

582
00:50:13,253 --> 00:50:15,974
Too many ways those monsters
can get in up there.

583
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,198
We'll see who's right.

584
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:22,797
We'll see, when they come begging me
to let them in down here.

585
00:50:23,216 --> 00:50:25,435
- That's important, isn't it?
- What?

586
00:50:25,853 --> 00:50:27,528
To be right.
Everybody else to be wrong.

587
00:50:27,563 --> 00:50:29,327
What do you mean by that?

588
00:50:33,011 --> 00:50:35,983
Does anyone up there
know why we're being attacked?

589
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:39,500
Whatever it is,
it isn't just happening here.

590
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,429
It's some kind of mass murder.
It's going on everywhere.

591
00:50:43,142 --> 00:50:44,941
- The radio said to stay inside...
- Radio?

592
00:50:46,072 --> 00:50:47,788
Radio, upstairs.
I heard the news bulletin.

593
00:50:47,872 --> 00:50:50,802
There's a radio upstairs
and you boarded us in down here?

594
00:50:50,885 --> 00:50:53,104
- I know what I'm doing.
- What did it say?

595
00:50:53,146 --> 00:50:55,281
Nothing! Nothing.
They don't know anything yet.

596
00:50:55,783 --> 00:50:57,416
The... there's mass murder
everywhere, and

597
00:50:57,499 --> 00:51:00,681
people are supposed to
look for a safe place to hide.

598
00:51:00,723 --> 00:51:02,522
Take the boards
off that door.

599
00:51:03,402 --> 00:51:05,411
We are staying down here, Helen.

600
00:51:05,453 --> 00:51:08,257
Harry, that radio is at least
some kind of communication.

601
00:51:08,425 --> 00:51:10,309
If the authorities know
what's happening,

602
00:51:10,392 --> 00:51:13,406
Well, they'll send people for us,
or they'll tell us what to do.

603
00:51:13,741 --> 00:51:15,332
How are we going to know
what's going on,

604
00:51:15,373 --> 00:51:17,132
if we lock ourselves in this dungeon?

605
00:51:27,639 --> 00:51:29,732
We may not enjoy living together...

606
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:33,791
But dying together isn't
going to solve anything.

607
00:51:34,546 --> 00:51:36,680
Those people
aren't our enemies.

608
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,187
Mr. Cooper!

609
00:51:40,112 --> 00:51:43,294
Mr. Cooper? They found
a television set upstairs.

610
00:51:45,848 --> 00:51:46,852
Let's go up.

611
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,192
Tom?

612
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:49,447
Yes?

613
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:53,089
If Judy would come downstairs
for a few minutes,

614
00:51:53,173 --> 00:51:55,308
Harry and I
could come upstairs.

615
00:51:56,103 --> 00:51:57,735
Ok. Yeah. Right away.

616
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:01,838
Will you do it?

617
00:52:02,424 --> 00:52:03,812
Do I have to?

618
00:52:03,847 --> 00:52:07,615
Look, honey. Nothing's gonna get done
with them down there and us up here.

619
00:52:08,075 --> 00:52:11,843
- Do this. For me.
- Ok.

620
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:14,605
Ok, open up.

621
00:52:36,749 --> 00:52:38,465
I'll take good care of her, Helen.

622
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,279
She's all I have.

623
00:52:45,331 --> 00:52:46,795
Why don't you go upstairs now?

624
00:53:14,967 --> 00:53:16,349
Her brother was killed.

625
00:53:17,228 --> 00:53:19,028
Hey... give me
a hand with this thing.

626
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,334
I gotta go help Ben
with the television.

627
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:07,208
Don't be afraid of me.

628
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:11,143
I'm Helen Cooper. Harry's wife.

629
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:22,528
This place is ridiculous.
Look at this.

630
00:54:22,738 --> 00:54:24,663
There's a million weak spots up here.

631
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:28,138
Give me one of those.

632
00:54:32,575 --> 00:54:34,334
Her brother was killed.

633
00:54:42,161 --> 00:54:44,338
And they talk about these windows.

634
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:46,556
I can't see a damned thing.

635
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:49,319
There could be 15 million of
those things out there.

636
00:54:49,528 --> 00:54:51,203
That's how much good
these windows are.

637
00:54:55,807 --> 00:54:58,486
Why don't you do something
to help somebody?

638
00:55:03,594 --> 00:55:06,063
Here, I have it. Drag a couple
of those chairs together.

639
00:55:06,482 --> 00:55:07,989
There's a socket over here.

640
00:55:13,095 --> 00:55:16,193
Now, you'd better watch this and try
to understand what's going on.

641
00:55:18,077 --> 00:55:19,709
I don't want anyone's life
on my hands.

642
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:21,265
Is there anything
I can do to help?

643
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,974
I don't want to hear any more
from you, mister.

644
00:55:23,142 --> 00:55:25,192
If you stay up here,
you take orders from me!

645
00:55:25,445 --> 00:55:27,453
And that includes
leaving the girl alone.

646
00:55:27,747 --> 00:55:28,918
It's on! It's on!

647
00:55:29,002 --> 00:55:30,049
There's no sound.

648
00:55:31,262 --> 00:55:32,644
Play with the rabbit ears.

649
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:36,160
<i>Reports,
incredible as they seem,</i>

650
00:55:36,202 --> 00:55:38,714
<i>are not the results
of mass hysteria.</i>

651
00:55:38,756 --> 00:55:41,895
"Mass hysteria. " What do they think,
we're imagining all this?

652
00:55:41,937 --> 00:55:42,774
Shut up.

653
00:55:42,816 --> 00:55:44,407
In all parts of the country.

654
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:47,965
The wave of murder which is sweeping
the eastern third of the nation

655
00:55:48,007 --> 00:55:50,274
is being committed by creatures

656
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:52,737
who feast upon the flesh
of their victims.

657
00:55:53,323 --> 00:55:56,176
First eyewitness accounts
of this grisly development

658
00:55:56,211 --> 00:56:00,439
came from people who were understandably
frightened and almost incoherent.

659
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,081
Officials and newsmen
at first discounted

660
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:06,927
those eyewitness descriptions
as being beyond belief.

661
00:56:07,136 --> 00:56:09,606
However, the reports persisted.

662
00:56:09,774 --> 00:56:12,251
Medical examinations
of some of the victims

663
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:16,136
bore out the fact that they
had been partially devoured.

664
00:56:18,187 --> 00:56:20,322
I think we have
some late word just arriving

665
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:22,708
and we interrupt
to bring this to you.

666
00:56:24,592 --> 00:56:26,601
This is the latest disclosure in a report

667
00:56:26,643 --> 00:56:29,322
from National civil defense
headquarters in Washington.

668
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:33,508
It has been established
that persons who have recently died

669
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:37,652
have been returning to life
and committing acts of murder.

670
00:56:38,238 --> 00:56:43,178
A widespread investigation of reports
from funeral homes, morgues & hospitals

671
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:47,280
has concluded that the unburied dead
are coming back to life

672
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:49,456
and seeking human victims.

673
00:56:50,294 --> 00:56:53,350
It's hard for us here to believe
what we're reporting to you,

674
00:56:53,385 --> 00:56:54,982
but it does seem to be a fact.

675
00:56:56,154 --> 00:56:57,829
When this emergency first began,

676
00:56:58,205 --> 00:57:01,638
radio and television was
advising people to stay inside,

677
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,031
behind locked doors, for safety.

678
00:57:04,066 --> 00:57:06,166
Well, that situation
has now changed.

679
00:57:06,201 --> 00:57:09,340
We're able to report a definite
course of action for you.

680
00:57:09,465 --> 00:57:11,977
Civil defense machinery has been
organized to provide

681
00:57:12,145 --> 00:57:15,207
rescue stations with food, shelter,

682
00:57:15,242 --> 00:57:18,717
medical treatment and protection
by armed National Guardsmen.

683
00:57:19,052 --> 00:57:22,442
Stay tuned to the broadcasting
stations in your local area

684
00:57:22,484 --> 00:57:24,291
for this list of rescue stations.

685
00:57:24,326 --> 00:57:27,423
This list will be repeated
throughout our news coverage.

686
00:57:27,507 --> 00:57:30,898
Look for the name of the rescue
station nearest you,

687
00:57:30,982 --> 00:57:34,415
and make your way to that
location as soon as possible.

688
00:57:34,624 --> 00:57:37,470
So we have that truck. If we can get
some gas, we can get outta here.

689
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:40,316
- There's a pump out by the shed.
- I know. That's why I pulled in here.

690
00:57:40,358 --> 00:57:41,286
But it's locked.

691
00:57:41,321 --> 00:57:43,833
...called this afternoon
by the president.

692
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:47,181
Since convening, this conference
of the presidential cabinet,

693
00:57:47,223 --> 00:57:50,154
The FBI, the joint chiefs of staff,
the CIA

694
00:57:50,196 --> 00:57:53,126
has not produced
any public information.

695
00:57:53,251 --> 00:57:56,265
Why are space experts
being consulted

696
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,065
about an earthbound emergency?

697
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:02,084
So far, all the betting
on the answer to that question

698
00:58:02,125 --> 00:58:05,223
centers on the recent explorer
satellite shot to Venus.

699
00:58:05,809 --> 00:58:09,032
That satellite, you recall,
started back to Earth,

700
00:58:09,067 --> 00:58:10,414
but never got here.

701
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:13,218
That's the space vehicle
which orbited Venus

702
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,583
and then was purposely
destroyed by NASA,

703
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:17,906
when scientists discovered
it was carrying

704
00:58:17,948 --> 00:58:20,209
a mysterious,
high-level radiation with it.

705
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,097
Could that radiation
be somehow responsible

706
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,818
for the wholesale murders
we're now suffering?

707
00:58:26,446 --> 00:58:28,916
Newsman Don Quinn in Washington

708
00:58:28,957 --> 00:58:30,005
has posed those questions.

709
00:58:30,046 --> 00:58:32,349
It's obvious. Our best move is
to try to get out of here.

710
00:58:32,474 --> 00:58:34,064
How're you gonna get
over to that pump?

711
00:58:34,484 --> 00:58:35,362
Look!

712
00:58:36,241 --> 00:58:39,214
You're coming from a meeting regarding
the explosion of the Venus probe,

713
00:58:39,255 --> 00:58:40,050
is that right?

714
00:58:40,176 --> 00:58:42,694
Yes, yes, that was the subject
of the meeting.

715
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:44,990
Do you feel there is a connection
between this and the phenomenon...

716
00:58:45,031 --> 00:58:47,879
There's a definite connection.
A definite connection.

717
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,390
In other words, you feel that the
radiation on the Venus probe is enough

718
00:58:50,516 --> 00:58:51,736
to cause these mutations?

719
00:58:51,771 --> 00:58:53,445
It was a very high
degree of radiation.

720
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:56,417
Well, just a minute. I'm not sure
that that's certain at all.

721
00:58:56,459 --> 00:58:59,390
I don't think that has been...
It's the only logical explanation

722
00:58:59,432 --> 00:59:00,143
that we have at this time.

723
00:59:00,478 --> 00:59:02,069
In other words, it is the military's
viewpoint that this...

724
00:59:02,104 --> 00:59:04,831
the radiation is not
the cause of the mutation.

725
00:59:04,873 --> 00:59:07,804
I can't speak for the entire military
at this time, gentlemen.

726
00:59:08,432 --> 00:59:10,943
I must disagree
with these gentlemen presently,

727
00:59:10,985 --> 00:59:13,580
until we, until this
is irrefutably proved.

728
00:59:13,915 --> 00:59:15,924
Everything is being done
that can be done.

729
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:17,933
We'll have to hurry
for our next meeting.

730
00:59:19,357 --> 00:59:22,036
Professor, you feel that there is
a definite connection between...

731
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,300
A definite connection as far as
Dr. Keller and myself...

732
00:59:25,342 --> 00:59:28,441
Doctor, please. I thought we decided
that is not proved yet.

733
00:59:28,943 --> 00:59:30,283
Was it... was the satellite...

734
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:33,212
- When the satellite was exploded...
- It was an unusual amount of radiation,

735
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,891
enough to cause mutation
under certain circumstances.

736
00:59:36,226 --> 00:59:38,277
Could have happened
to have a bearing on it.

737
00:59:38,737 --> 00:59:40,328
It does seem to have a bearing on it.

738
00:59:40,538 --> 00:59:43,427
Will there be a reply for the...

739
00:59:44,012 --> 00:59:45,435
- There will be a reply?
- Yes.

740
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:46,440
Later this afternoon?

741
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:51,338
There will be
a report this afternoon.

742
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,807
Perhaps there will be
a report later...

743
00:59:53,849 --> 00:59:54,812
Will you close the window?

744
00:59:54,854 --> 00:59:57,449
We are doing everything possible
to solve the problem.

745
01:00:03,603 --> 01:00:06,031
We've heard all we need to know.
We have to try to get out of here.

746
01:00:06,198 --> 01:00:09,546
He said the rescue stations have
doctors and medical supplies.

747
01:00:09,581 --> 01:00:12,016
If we can get Karen there,
we can get help for her.

748
01:00:16,077 --> 01:00:18,128
Willard. I saw a sign.
That said Willard.

749
01:00:18,463 --> 01:00:20,395
It's only about 17 miles from here.

750
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,565
You know this area.
Are you from around here?

751
01:00:22,691 --> 01:00:24,323
Judy and I are both from around here.

752
01:00:24,365 --> 01:00:26,877
We were on our way
to the lake to go swimming.

753
01:00:27,086 --> 01:00:30,017
Judy had a radio, and we heard
the first reports about this.

754
01:00:30,142 --> 01:00:32,151
So we knew the old house
was here and we came in,

755
01:00:32,193 --> 01:00:34,118
And found the lady upstairs, dead.

756
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:37,593
Then these other people came.
We went down into the basement

757
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:40,314
and put a bar across the door,
and it is pretty strong.

758
01:00:40,397 --> 01:00:42,700
How could we possibly
get away from here?

759
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:46,216
We've got a sick child, two women,
one woman out of her head,

760
01:00:46,258 --> 01:00:49,523
three men, and the place is
surrounded with these things.

761
01:00:49,899 --> 01:00:53,709
For NASA.
Dr. Grimes, your entire staff, I know,

762
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:57,476
has been working very hard
to find some solution

763
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,528
to these things that are happening.

764
01:00:59,611 --> 01:01:01,502
Do you have any answers at this time?

765
01:01:01,537 --> 01:01:05,849
Yes, we have some answers.
But first let me stress the importance

766
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:09,489
of seeking medical attention for anyone
who's been injured in any way.

767
01:01:09,524 --> 01:01:13,090
We don't know yet what complications
might result from such injuries.

768
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:15,392
How bad has your kid been hurt?

769
01:01:20,248 --> 01:01:23,303
Look. You go down there and tell...
Judy?

770
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:26,569
Yeah, you tell Judy to come up here
and you stay with the kid, all right?

771
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,833
Destructive action taken
with regard to the Venus probe.

772
01:01:30,713 --> 01:01:34,354
In the cold room at the university,
we had a cadaver.

773
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:38,582
A cadaver from which all four limbs
had been amputated.

774
01:01:39,043 --> 01:01:40,592
Sometime early this morning,

775
01:01:40,885 --> 01:01:44,031
it opened its eyes
and began to move its trunk.

776
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:47,540
It was dead, but it opened its eyes
and tried to move.

777
01:01:50,304 --> 01:01:51,726
They want you upstairs.

778
01:01:51,936 --> 01:01:54,866
- Did she ask for me?
- She hasn't said anything.

779
01:01:55,996 --> 01:01:57,378
I don't understand.

780
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:02,066
Baby? It's mommy.

781
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:04,285
I hurt.

782
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:08,345
I'll come back down as soon as
I find out what they want.

783
01:02:08,931 --> 01:02:10,438
Thank you, Judy.

784
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:15,336
The bodies should be disposed of
at once, preferably by cremation.

785
01:02:15,545 --> 01:02:19,396
Well, how long after death, then,
does the body become reactivated?

786
01:02:19,431 --> 01:02:21,496
- It's only a matter of minutes.
- Minutes?

787
01:02:21,531 --> 01:02:23,464
That doesn't give people time
to make arrangements...

788
01:02:23,499 --> 01:02:27,098
No, you're right. It doesn't give them
time to make funeral arrangements.

789
01:02:27,391 --> 01:02:31,577
The bodies must be carried
to the street and burned.

790
01:02:31,912 --> 01:02:35,596
They must be burned immediately.
Soak them with gasoline and burn them.

791
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:39,865
The bereaved will have to forgo
the dubious comforts

792
01:02:39,907 --> 01:02:41,707
that a funeral service will give.

793
01:02:42,335 --> 01:02:45,014
They're just dead flesh.
And dangerous.

794
01:02:45,684 --> 01:02:48,154
Judy, I need you to find
some bedspreads or sheets

795
01:02:48,196 --> 01:02:49,953
to tear up into small strips, ok?

796
01:02:50,373 --> 01:02:52,549
- Is there a fruit cellar here?
- Yes.

797
01:02:52,717 --> 01:02:54,021
We need some bottles or jars

798
01:02:54,056 --> 01:02:56,986
to make Molotov cocktails to hold
them off while we try to escape.

799
01:02:57,021 --> 01:02:58,953
Hey! There's a big can
of kerosene down there.

800
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:01,591
- I'll see what I can find.
- I'll look for the bottles.

801
01:03:01,675 --> 01:03:03,475
There's a big key ring down there.

802
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,861
There may be a key
to the gas pump on it.

803
01:03:06,112 --> 01:03:07,534
I'll check.

804
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:10,046
We can toss the cocktails
from a window upstairs.

805
01:03:10,298 --> 01:03:12,977
Meantime, some of us can go out
and try to get the gas,

806
01:03:13,019 --> 01:03:14,735
then we can come back
for the rest of the people.

807
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:16,534
But that'll leave
a door open someplace.

808
01:03:16,576 --> 01:03:19,088
Yeah, that's right.
It better be this door.

809
01:03:19,423 --> 01:03:21,013
It's closer to the truck.

810
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,823
Before we go out, we'll put
some supplies behind the cellar door.

811
01:03:24,865 --> 01:03:26,665
While we're gone, the rest of you
can hole up in there.

812
01:03:26,707 --> 01:03:28,549
I found some fruit jars
in the cellar.

813
01:03:28,841 --> 01:03:31,646
And there's a key on here that's
labeled for the gas pump out back.

814
01:03:33,237 --> 01:03:36,334
I'm not really that used to the truck.
I found it abandoned.

815
01:03:37,004 --> 01:03:38,929
I can handle the truck,
no sweat.

816
01:03:42,404 --> 01:03:44,581
You're it, then.
You and I'll go.

817
01:03:50,064 --> 01:03:52,744
We'll put whatever lumber we find
behind the cellar door.

818
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,510
You can go upstairs and toss
the cocktails from a window.

819
01:03:57,264 --> 01:03:59,190
Tom, you and I will have to
unboard this door.

820
01:03:59,483 --> 01:04:00,906
After you toss the cocktails,

821
01:04:00,989 --> 01:04:02,873
you hustle back down here
and lock this door.

822
01:04:03,124 --> 01:04:05,720
It's no good to board it up because
we'll have to get back in quickly.

823
01:04:07,017 --> 01:04:10,115
After we get the gas
and get back into the house,

824
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:12,753
then we'll worry about getting
everybody into the truck.

825
01:04:13,882 --> 01:04:15,145
Now, let's move it.

826
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,780
No place to flee for safety,
except for the rescue stations

827
01:04:18,822 --> 01:04:19,701
which have been set up.

828
01:04:20,036 --> 01:04:23,636
Indications are that
before this emergency is over,

829
01:04:23,678 --> 01:04:27,194
we will need many, many more
such rescue stations.

830
01:04:36,382 --> 01:04:37,931
You always have a smile for me.

831
01:04:38,984 --> 01:04:41,580
How can you smile like that
all the time?

832
01:04:43,308 --> 01:04:44,773
How many do you have done?

833
01:04:48,525 --> 01:04:50,200
Come on, honey, we gotta move.

834
01:04:51,078 --> 01:04:52,324
Tom, are you sure about the phone?

835
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:56,548
The phone is dead out.
All you get is a recorded message.

836
01:04:57,057 --> 01:05:00,813
If I could only call the folks. They're
going to be so worried about us.

837
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,317
Everything'll be all right.

838
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:06,948
As soon as we get to Willard, we'll
call them. They might even be there.

839
01:05:07,908 --> 01:05:08,827
I know.

840
01:05:13,293 --> 01:05:18,468
Tom... Are you sure we're doing
the right thing, Tom?

841
01:05:18,718 --> 01:05:20,638
- What, about getting outta here?
- Yeah.

842
01:05:21,515 --> 01:05:23,644
Well, the television said
that's the right thing to do.

843
01:05:23,727 --> 01:05:25,939
We've got to get
to a rescue station.

844
01:05:26,315 --> 01:05:27,525
I don't know.

845
01:05:27,817 --> 01:05:30,071
Come on. You're starting
to sound like Mr. Cooper now.

846
01:05:30,112 --> 01:05:32,206
But why do you have to go out there?

847
01:05:32,241 --> 01:05:35,956
Look, I know how to handle that truck.
And I can handle the pump.

848
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,085
Ben doesn't know anything
about that stuff.

849
01:05:39,845 --> 01:05:41,229
But we're safe in here.

850
01:05:41,264 --> 01:05:43,810
For how long, honey?
We're safe now.

851
01:05:43,936 --> 01:05:46,481
But there's gonna be more
and more of those things.

852
01:05:46,523 --> 01:05:48,318
I know.
I know all that.

853
01:05:52,742 --> 01:05:56,790
Listen. Remember when
we had the big flood?

854
01:05:57,417 --> 01:06:01,507
Remember how difficult it was for us to
convince you that it was right to leave?

855
01:06:01,883 --> 01:06:04,512
Remember? Remember we had
to go to Willard then?

856
01:06:04,804 --> 01:06:06,933
This isn't a passing thing,
honey.

857
01:06:07,976 --> 01:06:10,689
It... it's not like
just a wind passing through.

858
01:06:10,814 --> 01:06:13,569
We've got to do something,
and fast.

859
01:06:19,621 --> 01:06:22,292
I just don't want you
to go out there, that's all.

860
01:06:23,962 --> 01:06:25,297
Hey... smile, honey.

861
01:06:26,299 --> 01:06:28,052
Where's that big smile for me?

862
01:06:32,727 --> 01:06:35,022
You sure are
no use at all, are you?

863
01:06:35,481 --> 01:06:40,281
We've got work to do, honey.
And you... you...

864
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:58,353
We better get her downstairs.

865
01:06:58,603 --> 01:07:00,857
We have to go downstairs now, Barbra.

866
01:07:02,694 --> 01:07:04,948
She's right. You have
to go downstairs now.

867
01:07:05,073 --> 01:07:07,494
Just for a little while,
until we get back.

868
01:07:08,329 --> 01:07:12,920
- Then we can all leave.
- Oh, I'd like to leave. Yes.

869
01:07:32,077 --> 01:07:33,997
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

870
01:08:23,874 --> 01:08:25,751
- You ready upstairs?
- Yeah.

871
01:08:25,786 --> 01:08:27,046
Ok, toss 'em!

872
01:09:07,781 --> 01:09:09,284
Go ahead! Go on!

873
01:09:25,353 --> 01:09:26,230
I'm going with him!

874
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:29,902
Get back in the cellar!
It's too late. Too late!

875
01:09:38,167 --> 01:09:39,669
Well, is she coming?
Come on.

876
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,674
Get in!

877
01:10:55,879 --> 01:10:57,132
- Come on!
- This key won't work.

878
01:10:57,167 --> 01:10:58,717
Watch it.

879
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,815
Watch the torch!

880
01:11:13,451 --> 01:11:14,996
We've gotta get away from the pump!

881
01:11:26,932 --> 01:11:27,641
Hang on!

882
01:11:29,147 --> 01:11:31,484
Stop! I'm telling you guys
to get outta the truck!

883
01:11:49,762 --> 01:11:51,724
Let's get outta here!

884
01:11:53,644 --> 01:11:54,812
Come on, come on!

885
01:11:54,847 --> 01:11:55,982
My jacket's caught.

886
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:05,720
Let me in!

887
01:13:06,847 --> 01:13:07,682
Cooper!

888
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:15,047
I ought to drag you out there
and feed you to those things.

889
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:47,829
Isn't it three o'clock yet?

890
01:15:52,503 --> 01:15:55,676
There's supposed to be another
broadcast at three o'clock.

891
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:57,094
Ten minutes.

892
01:15:59,766 --> 01:16:01,518
Oh. Only ten more minutes?

893
01:16:01,937 --> 01:16:04,191
We don't have very long to wait.

894
01:16:05,067 --> 01:16:06,319
We can leave.

895
01:16:08,322 --> 01:16:09,908
Or we better leave soon.

896
01:16:10,743 --> 01:16:12,204
It's ten minutes to three.

897
01:16:18,089 --> 01:16:19,967
You know anything
about this area at all?

898
01:16:20,593 --> 01:16:22,138
I mean,
is Willard the nearest town?

899
01:16:24,266 --> 01:16:25,685
I don't know.

900
01:16:28,565 --> 01:16:30,484
We were...

901
01:16:32,279 --> 01:16:35,744
Just trying to get
to a motel before dark.

902
01:16:36,912 --> 01:16:38,624
You said those things
turned your car over.

903
01:16:38,832 --> 01:16:41,253
You think we can get it back on
its wheels and drive it? Where is it?

904
01:16:41,295 --> 01:16:43,674
Seems like it was pretty far away.

905
01:16:44,884 --> 01:16:46,471
Seems like we ran.

906
01:16:46,946 --> 01:16:49,074
Forget it.
It's at least a mile.

907
01:16:49,449 --> 01:16:51,119
Johnny has the keys.

908
01:16:51,703 --> 01:16:53,664
You're going to carry
that child a mile?

909
01:16:53,705 --> 01:16:55,666
Through that army
of things out there?

910
01:16:55,701 --> 01:16:56,709
I can carry the kid.

911
01:16:57,669 --> 01:16:59,171
What's wrong with her?
How'd she get hurt?

912
01:17:00,673 --> 01:17:03,719
- One of those things grabbed her.
- Bit her on the arm.

913
01:17:05,972 --> 01:17:06,807
What's wrong?

914
01:17:07,391 --> 01:17:09,977
Who knows what kind of disease
those things carry?

915
01:17:10,812 --> 01:17:13,357
- Is she conscious?
- Barely.

916
01:17:13,649 --> 01:17:15,944
She can't walk.
She's too weak.

917
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:21,368
Well, one of us could try
to get to the car.

918
01:17:21,409 --> 01:17:23,204
You gonna turn it over
by yourself?

919
01:17:23,245 --> 01:17:26,959
You can't start the car.
Johnny has the keys.

920
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:32,967
You have a car?
Where? Where is it?

921
01:17:33,218 --> 01:17:37,014
- You won't be able to start it.
- Yeah. I know. But where is it?

922
01:17:50,282 --> 01:17:51,368
Good lord.

923
01:18:06,639 --> 01:18:10,560
At this hour, they report the level
of the mysterious radiation

924
01:18:10,685 --> 01:18:12,730
continues to increase steadily.

925
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:15,318
So long as this situation remains,

926
01:18:15,443 --> 01:18:18,071
government spokesmen warn
that dead bodies

927
01:18:18,113 --> 01:18:21,534
will continue to be transformed
into the flesh-eating ghouls.

928
01:18:21,575 --> 01:18:25,790
All persons who die during
this crisis, from whatever cause,

929
01:18:25,831 --> 01:18:28,501
will come back to life
to seek human victims.

930
01:18:28,586 --> 01:18:32,007
Unless their bodies are
first disposed of by cremation.

931
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:34,718
Our News cameras
have just returned

932
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:38,265
from covering such a search and
destroy operation against the ghouls.

933
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,769
This one conducted
by sheriff Conan McClellan

934
01:18:40,935 --> 01:18:42,771
in Butler County, Pennsylvania.

935
01:18:42,938 --> 01:18:44,566
So now let's go
to that film report.

936
01:18:45,483 --> 01:18:48,487
All law enforcement agencies
and the military

937
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:52,284
have been organized to search out
and destroy the marauding ghouls.

938
01:18:52,451 --> 01:18:54,662
The survival command center
at the Pentagon

939
01:18:54,787 --> 01:18:58,001
has disclosed
that a ghoul can be killed

940
01:18:58,168 --> 01:19:02,131
by a shot in the head
or a heavy blow to the skull.

941
01:19:02,799 --> 01:19:04,510
Officials are quoted as explaining

942
01:19:04,593 --> 01:19:08,222
that since the brain of a ghoul has
been activated by the radiation,

943
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,729
the plan is, kill the brain
and you kill the ghoul.

944
01:19:13,897 --> 01:19:17,401
- Want anything from the supply wagon?
- No, we're all right.

945
01:19:18,737 --> 01:19:21,038
Hey, Cass, put that thing
all the way in the fire.

946
01:19:21,073 --> 01:19:23,702
- We don't want it getting up again.
- All right, I gotcha.

947
01:19:23,737 --> 01:19:25,705
Chief McClellan,
how's everything going?

948
01:19:25,746 --> 01:19:28,793
Oh, things aren't going too bad.
Men are taking it pretty good.

949
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:31,546
You want to get on the other side
of the road over there.

950
01:19:32,172 --> 01:19:33,966
Chief, do you think we'll be
able to defeat these things?

951
01:19:34,508 --> 01:19:37,137
Well, we killed 19 of them
today, right in this area.

952
01:19:37,345 --> 01:19:40,600
Those last three we caught trying to
claw their way into an abandoned shed.

953
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:43,396
They must have thought somebody
was in there. There wasn't, though.

954
01:19:43,437 --> 01:19:45,030
We heard 'em making all kind of noise.

955
01:19:45,065 --> 01:19:47,610
We came over and beat 'em off,
blasted 'em down.

956
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:49,863
Chief, as soon as you're finished,
can I see you here?

957
01:19:49,946 --> 01:19:50,739
Yeah, ok.

958
01:19:50,906 --> 01:19:53,869
Chief, if I were surrounded
by six or eight of these things,

959
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:55,203
would I stand a chance with them?

960
01:19:55,245 --> 01:19:57,833
Well, there's no problem. If you
had a gun, shoot 'em in the head.

961
01:19:57,868 --> 01:19:59,007
That's a sure way to kill 'em.

962
01:19:59,042 --> 01:20:01,212
If you don't, get yourself
a club or a torch.

963
01:20:01,253 --> 01:20:03,256
Beat 'em or burn 'em.
They go up pretty easy.

964
01:20:03,798 --> 01:20:06,176
Well, chief McClellan,
how long do you think it'll take

965
01:20:06,211 --> 01:20:07,929
until you get the situation
under control?

966
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:11,226
Well, that's pretty hard to say. We
don't know how many of 'em there are.

967
01:20:11,267 --> 01:20:13,019
We know when we find 'em,
we can kill 'em.

968
01:20:14,563 --> 01:20:15,774
Are they slow-moving, chief?

969
01:20:15,982 --> 01:20:18,909
Yeah, they're dead.
They're all messed up.

970
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:23,158
Well, in time, would you say you'd be
able to wrap this up in 24 hours?

971
01:20:23,534 --> 01:20:26,120
Well, we don't really know.

972
01:20:26,162 --> 01:20:29,792
We know we'll be into it most of the
night, probably into the early morning.

973
01:20:29,834 --> 01:20:31,587
We're working our way toward Willard

974
01:20:31,628 --> 01:20:33,631
and we'll team up with the
National Guard over there,

975
01:20:33,673 --> 01:20:35,634
and then we'll be able
to give a more definite view.

976
01:20:35,801 --> 01:20:37,553
Thank you very much,
chief McClellan.

977
01:20:37,929 --> 01:20:41,183
This is Bill Cardille,
WIC-TV 11 news.

978
01:20:41,725 --> 01:20:43,019
Thank you, Bill, for that report.

979
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:45,988
Official spokesmen
declined to speculate

980
01:20:46,023 --> 01:20:49,027
just how long it may
take to kill off all the flesh-eaters

981
01:20:49,236 --> 01:20:50,989
so long as the heavy ra...

982
01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:58,999
Is the fuse box in the cellar?

983
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:00,877
I don't know. I...

984
01:21:05,091 --> 01:21:06,425
Is... isn't the fuse...

985
01:21:07,552 --> 01:21:08,637
The power lines are down.

986
01:21:11,475 --> 01:21:14,562
Helen?
I have to get that gun.

987
01:21:16,398 --> 01:21:18,067
Haven't you had enough?

988
01:21:18,943 --> 01:21:21,988
Two people are dead already,
on account of that guy.

989
01:21:22,073 --> 01:21:23,657
Take a look out that window.
Look at...

990
01:22:22,572 --> 01:22:23,656
Get over here, man!

991
01:22:25,701 --> 01:22:26,326
Come on!

992
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:48,648
Go ahead. Go ahead.
You wanna stay up here now?

993
01:22:49,233 --> 01:22:50,735
Helen, get in the cellar.

994
01:22:53,113 --> 01:22:55,074
Get in the cellar now!
Move!

995
01:24:39,675 --> 01:24:40,510
Karen?

996
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:51,192
Oh, baby.

997
01:24:53,612 --> 01:24:54,654
Baby.

998
01:25:56,989 --> 01:26:00,286
No... no...
No! Johnny!

999
01:26:05,167 --> 01:26:07,170
Somebody help me.

1000
01:30:39,951 --> 01:30:41,037
Hey, Vince, Bill,

1001
01:30:41,579 --> 01:30:44,291
you wanna get about four
or five men and a couple dogs?

1002
01:30:44,374 --> 01:30:47,254
There's a house over here behind those
trees. We wanna go check it out.

1003
01:30:47,546 --> 01:30:48,922
You still here, Bill?

1004
01:30:48,963 --> 01:30:50,508
Yeah, chief,
we're going to stay with it

1005
01:30:50,549 --> 01:30:51,975
till we meet up
with the National Guard.

1006
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:54,221
- Where'd you get the coffee?
- One of the volunteers.

1007
01:30:54,256 --> 01:30:55,981
- You're doing all the work, take it.
Thank you.

1008
01:30:56,016 --> 01:30:58,727
We should be wrapped up here.
About three or four more hours,

1009
01:30:58,853 --> 01:31:00,194
we'll probably get into Willard's end.

1010
01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:02,449
I guess you can go over there
and meet the national guard.

1011
01:31:02,484 --> 01:31:04,669
Nick, you and the rest
of these men wanna come with me?

1012
01:31:05,504 --> 01:31:07,340
Bill, I'm checking the office
to see what's happening.

1013
01:31:07,632 --> 01:31:10,093
All right, Steve, tell 'em
we're going to stay with it

1014
01:31:10,128 --> 01:31:13,055
and everything appears
to be under control.

1015
01:32:02,957 --> 01:32:05,169
They need you down there
by the barn.

1016
01:32:09,048 --> 01:32:11,176
You guys can follow the wagon down.

1017
01:32:11,218 --> 01:32:13,722
I only need a few men
to check out the house.

1018
01:32:16,643 --> 01:32:19,938
- Somebody had a cookout here, Vince.
- Yeah, sure looks like it, Con.

1019
01:32:59,159 --> 01:33:00,953
He's a dead one.
Get up here!

1020
01:33:02,454 --> 01:33:04,499
Nick! Tony! Steve!

1021
01:33:04,582 --> 01:33:06,877
You wanna get out in that
field and build me a bonfire?

1022
01:33:19,812 --> 01:33:22,565
You. Drag that out of here
and throw it on the fire.

1023
01:33:22,608 --> 01:33:23,525
Nothing down here.

1024
01:33:23,609 --> 01:33:25,487
All right. Go ahead down
and give 'em a hand.

1025
01:33:25,737 --> 01:33:27,030
Let's go check out the house.

1026
01:33:27,072 --> 01:33:28,699
There's something there.
I heard a noise.

1027
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:36,251
All right, Vince. Hit him in the head.
Right between the eyes.

1028
01:33:40,173 --> 01:33:43,511
Good shot. Ok, he's dead.
Let's go get him.

1029
01:33:43,546 --> 01:33:45,097
That's another one for the fire.

1030
01:34:06,501 --> 01:34:08,295
All right, send a wagon through...

1031
01:34:17,079 --> 01:34:19,457
Keep those dogs back off
of those things.

1032
01:35:20,458 --> 01:35:24,464
Come ahead with the motorcycle,
please. Let's go!

1033
01:35:28,258 --> 01:35:30,553
Hey Randy,
light these torches over here.

1034
01:35:31,554 --> 01:35:36,554
