( sniffles )

170
00:23:52,655 --> 00:23:54,956
I killed three walkers.

171
00:23:56,676 --> 00:23:58,794
They were at the door.

172
00:23:58,795 --> 00:24:01,380
They were gonna get in,

173
00:24:01,381 --> 00:24:04,549
but I lured them away.

174
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:08,637
I killed them.

175
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,191
I saved you.

176
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:15,677
I saved you.

177
00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:19,448
I didn't forget while
you had us playing farmer.

178
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:21,900
I still know how to survive.

179
00:24:23,903 --> 00:24:25,987
Lucky for us.

180
00:24:29,992 --> 00:24:32,461
I don't need you anymore.

181
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:37,332
I don't need you
to protect me anymore.

182
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,084
I can take care of myself.

183
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:40,585
<i>You probably can't even</i>
<i>protect me anyways.</i>

184
00:24:40,586 --> 00:24:42,637
You couldn't protect Judith.

185
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:44,389
You couldn't protect...

186
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,258
( sighs )

187
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:48,894

or Mom.

191
00:24:57,854 --> 00:25:00,739
You just wanted
to plant vegetables.

192
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,491
You just wanted to hide.

193
00:25:02,492 --> 00:25:05,444
He knew where we were
and you didn't care!

194
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:07,412
You just hid
behind those fences

195
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:09,197
and waited for...

196
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:10,732
( sighs )

197
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:12,534
They're all gone now.

198
00:25:12,535 --> 00:25:15,069
Because of you!

199
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,922
They counted on you!

200
00:25:16,923 --> 00:25:18,757
You were their leader!

201
00:25:24,464 --> 00:25:27,248
( sniffles )

202
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:29,267
But now...

203
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,472
you're nothing.

204
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,114

206
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:56,328
I'd be fine if you died.

It's dangerous.

It's good that
you found more food.

we'll never get things back
to the way they used to be.
