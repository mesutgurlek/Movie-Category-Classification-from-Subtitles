I liked it better befOre.

157
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,832
That's because befOre,
sOmebOdy else made it.

158
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,996
When are they cOming back?

159
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,478
They're nOt cOming back, child.

160
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,353
Just like Daddy.

161
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,789
Daddy is cOming back, thOugh.

162
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,719
Mrs Mills, Our father's
fighting in a War in France.

163
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,113
NICHOLAS : It's the WOrld War.

164
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,957

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,118
That's enOugh, chatterbOxes.

00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,638
Why shOuld I leave yOu?

169
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,636
The Others
said they WOuldn 't...

170
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,591
but they did,
and then it happened.

171
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,517
Be quiet!

172
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,710
What dO yOu mean, Anne ?
What happened?

173
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,799
Mummy Went... mad.

00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,513
-NOthing happened.

177
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,232
What's gOing On ?
I Want thOse plates empty...

178
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,475
in less than a minute.
Is that clear?

179
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,790
Mrs Mills, WOuld yOu
cOme Outside a mOment?

180
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,796
I'd like a WOrd With yOu.

181
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,913
Yes, ma 'am.

182
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,439
The pOstman usually
cOmes every Wednesday.

183
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,879
But I just checked
the letter-bOx...

184
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,115
and this Week he hasn 't.

185
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,071
I'm afraid
I dOn 't fOllOW, ma 'am.

186
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,951
This letter
shOuld have been cOllected...

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,560
and delivered tO
the neWspaper five days agO.

188
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,999
It's an adverisement
fOr servants.

189
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,234
Since it Was never published...

190
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,874
WOuld yOu explain
What yOu 're dOing here ?

191
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,718
Oh, I understand.

192
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,718
Ma 'am, that's What
I Was gOing tO say tO yOu...

193
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,193
When yOu Opened the dOOr tO us.

194
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,629
The truth is
that We just cOme by...

195
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,875
On the Off chance.

196
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,433
A big hOuse like this...

197
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,948
is alWays in need Of sOmeOne
WhO knOWs the rOpes.

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,798
YOu 've served in a hOuse
like this One befOre ?

199
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,354
This may cOme as a surprise
tO yOu, ma 'am, but...

200
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,029
We, in fact,
used tO WOrk here.

201
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,349
Here ?

202
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,678
Oh, nOW,
'tWas a feW years agO.

203
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,553
If yOu dOn 't mind
my saying sO, ma 'am...

204
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,229
they Were the best years
Of my life.

205
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,477
That's Why We cOme by,
because this hOuse...

206
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,351
means a lOt tO us.

207
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,233
Perhaps I'd best shOW yOu
Our references, ma 'am.

208
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,953
NO, nO, nO. DOn 't bOther.
There 's nO need.

209
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,070
SO yOu say
yOu knOW the hOuse Well?

210
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,475
MPS MILLS :
Like the back Of my hand.

211
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,512
That is assuming the Walls
haven 't sprOuted legs...

212
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,471
and mOved in the meantime.

213
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,557
graCE: The Only thing
that mOves here is the light.

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,992
[Sighs]
But it changes everything.

215
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,994
It's rather difficult,
tO say the least.

216
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,239
One might
almOst say... unbearable.

217
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,750
The Only Way Of enduring it
is by keeping a cOOl head.

218
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,995
Oh, yes, ma 'am.

219
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,600
I dOn 't like fantasies.

220
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,915
Strange ideas.
DO yOu knOW What I mean ?

221
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,918
I think sO, ma 'am.

222
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,748
My children sOmetimes
have strange ideas.

223
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,473
But yOu mustn 't pay
any attentiOn tO them.

224
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,398
Children Will be children.

225
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,715
Yes, Of cOurse, ma 'am.

226
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,550
All right. YOu can stay.

227
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,554
Thank yOu very much, ma 'am.

228
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,630
It did happen.

00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,038
NICHOLAS : "The POman gOvernOr

Well...

Well, What?

244
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,629
ThOse children
Were really stupid.

245
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,636
Why?

246
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,398
Because they said
they Only believed in Jesus...

247
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,000
and then
they gOt killed fOr it.

SO yOu WOuld have lied
tO the pOint Of denying Christ.

YOu 'd have saved yOur heads

Ma 'am, this is a very Old hOuse.

00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,718
The flOOrbOards squeak
and the plumbing clanks--

623
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,557
There Were vOices.

NOthing Will happen tO yOu

640
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,637
ANNE: LOOk, Mummy.
She really scares me.

641
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,874
It's as if

Her breath smells.

650
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,110
We have tO Open

ANNE: I dOn 't.
I read them in bOOks.

664
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,191
Well, yOu shOuldn 't

That's What Our mOther says.

00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,350
She says all this stuff
abOut ghOsts is rubbish...

668
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,277
and then she expects us...

tO believe everything
Written in the Bible.

670
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,873
And dOn 't yOu believe it?

00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,069
I believe sOme things.

00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,350
But, fOr example,
I dOn 't believe...

00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,475
NO, I dOn 't

Yes ?

685
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,475
They've searched

DO yOu have any idea
What this might be ?

691
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,477
'Tis a phOtOgraph album, ma 'am.

692
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,953
NO, but lOOk.
They're all asleep.

They're nOt asleep, ma 'am.
They're dead.

'Tis a bOOk Of the dead.

696
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,831
In the last century,
I believe...

697
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,711
they used tO take
phOtOgraphs Of the dead...

Oh, it's macabre!

HOW cOuld these peOple
be sO superstitiOus ?

704
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,315
grief Over the death
Of a lOved One...

705
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,399
can lead peOple tO dO

706
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,478
graCE: get rid Of it.
I dOn 't Want it in the hOuse.

707
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,317
MPS MILLS : Yes, ma 'am.

708
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,996
Mrs Mills, it's cOld.

709

Why dOn 't yOu cOme

710
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,237
Thank yOu very much, ma 'am.

SO... tell me abOut
When yOu WOrked here befOre.

712
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,156
Did yOu have
tO lOOk after children then ?

713
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,432
NO, I Was in charge Of
Organizing the hOuseWOrk.

714
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,040
Hmm.
Were there many servants ?

715
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,834
Oh, abOut fifteen.

716
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,074

717
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,270
there Were just

My emplOyers mOved tO LOndOn.

720
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,628
They came here
less and less...

it being
sO Out Of the Way like.

722
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,038
SO gradually the hOuse
just became empty.

723
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,676
EverybOdy ends up leaving
this damned island.

in the summer Of 1 940....

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,838
Ohh.

728
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,440
I dOn 't blame them.

729
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,870
Actually, We left, tOO.
