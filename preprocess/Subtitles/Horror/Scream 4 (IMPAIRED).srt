1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:12,928
(telephone ringing)

2
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,931
- Hello?
- (Ghostface) Hello.

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,642
- Uh, yes?
- Who is this?

4
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,353
- Who are you calling?
- Who am I speaking to?

5
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,063
(scoffs) Wrong number.
(beep)

6
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,441
- Who was that?
- Oh, nobody.

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,610
- Did you pick a movie?
- Yeah. We're gonna go scary.

8
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,405
- "Saw 4."
- Ugh. I saw that in theaters.

9
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,615
It sucks.
It's not scary, it's gross.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,534
I hate all that torture-porn shit.

11
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,203
(chuckles)
How do you really feel?

12
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,458
Well, I like Jigsaw.
I think he kills people very creatively.

13
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,919
But you don't give a shit who dies
'cause there's no character development.

14
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,797
There's just body parts ripping
and blood spewing. Blah.

15
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,759
- Who do you keep texting?
- I have a Facebook stalker.

16
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,803
- He keeps leaving me messages.
- Yeah, like what?

17
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,807
Just stuff. Like, "Hey, what's up?
You're hot. I wanna kill you."

18
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,601
So delete him.

19
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,187
I did,
but he hacked his way back in.

20
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,522
So report him.

21
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,943
He's really hot, though.
You wanna see?

22
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,324
That's Channing Tatum.

23
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,493
It is not.
Is it?

24
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,371
Yeah, from his Abercrombie days.
You are being punked.

25
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,540
(telephone rings)

26
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,297
- Hello?
- (Ghostface) Who is this?

27
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,592
The more impatient version
of the person you just spoke to.

28
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:36,512
I'm sorry.
You don't have to be a bitch about it.

29
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,055
No, of course I don't.
Eat me.

30
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,225
You hang up on me and I'll cut through
your neck until I feel bone!

31
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:44,103
- Who is it?
- It's for you.

32
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,899
- Hello?
- Who's this?

33
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,068
It's Trudie.
Who's this?

34
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,780
This is the last person
you're ever gonna see alive.

35
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,031
It's a prank. Hang up.

36
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,617
(beep)
Why'd you hand the phone to me?

37
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:02,037
You're the one with the stalker.
Are the doors locked?

38
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,206
Don't freak out.

39
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,835
(telephone rings)

40
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,922
Let it ring.

41
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,007
(beep)

42
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,969
(cell phone vibrates)

43
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,638
It's from stalker boy.

44
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,473
He said, "Answer the phone."

45
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,143
(sighs) For God's sake.
It's a joke, Trudie.

46
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,687
It's probably Lexi or Karen.
Where are you going?

47
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,231
To make sure
the front door is locked.

48
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,400
(doorbell rings, both scream)

49
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,026
No. Don't open it.

50
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,780
You're overreacting.
(scoffs)

51
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,659
It's a joke, Trudie, okay?
Somebody made a dummy profile.

52
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,911
- They're just trying to scare you.
- Wait.

53
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,247
(loudly) Who is it?

54
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,208
I said, who is it?

55
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,502
Let's call the cops.

56
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,255
(cell phone vibrates)

57
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,550
"I dare you to open the door."

58
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,260
No, Sherrie. Don't.

59
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,053
No, don't, I'm scared.

60
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,514
Hey,
it could be anyone that we know.

61
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,600
Lisa, Bailey, Wayne,

62
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,352
or the hopeful long shot,
Channing Tatum.

63
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,456
- There's nobody out here.
- (sighs softly)

64
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,876
(cell phone vibrates)

65
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,252
What does it say?

66
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:37,466
It says, "I'm not outside.
I'm right beside you."

67
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,469
(screams) Trudie!

68
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,763
Trudie... oh, my God.

69
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,097
(screams)

70
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,892
(gasping)

71
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,070
(woman screams)

72
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,491
Fucking kidding me?

73
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,867
What?

74
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,286
That was so fucking stupid.
Pure horseshit.

75
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,789
The death of horror
right here in front of us.

76
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,249
I jumped.
Scared me.

77
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,794
A fucking Facebook killer?
You're kidding me, right?

78
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,547
I guess now it would be Twitter.
That'd make more sense.

79
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,260
A bunch of articulate teens sit around
and deconstruct horror movies

80
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,845
until Ghostface kills them one by one?

81
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,639
It's been done to death,

82
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,850
the whole self-aware,
post-modern meta shit.

83
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,020
Stick a fork in 1996 already.

84
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,565
I like the "Stab" movies.
They're scarier.

85
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,860
It's not aliens or zombies
or little Asian ghost girls.

86
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:43,282
There's something real about a guy
with a knife who just...

87
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,326
snaps.

88
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,453
It could really happen.

89
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,249
I can't do it.
These sequels don't know when to stop.

90
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,835
They just keep recycling
the same shit.

91
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,378
Even the opening scene.

92
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,338
There's always some random girl
who gets a call

93
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,965
that undoubtedly ends up
getting her killed.

94
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,509
It's all so predictable.
There's no element of surprise.

95
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,178
You can see everything coming!

96
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,930
Aah! (gasps softly)

97
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,311
- (gasps)
- Did that surprise you?

98
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,481
It's your own fault.

99
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,233
Why?

100
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,777
- Because you talk too much.
- Agh!

101
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,865
Now shut the fuck up
and watch the movie.

102
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,787
(chokes wetly)

103
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,456
(woman screams)

104
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,666
Oh, my God, I love it.

105
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,669
I've seen it five times,
and it still gets me every time.

106
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,422
You're kidding.
I don't get it.

107
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,216
(TV shuts off)

108
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,969
Okay.
It's like "The Twilight Zone."

109
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,138
"Twilight Zone"?
A movie within a movie.

110
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,723
I get that.
But it's illogical.

111
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,559
It begs the question that if the
beginning of "Stab 7" is "Stab 6,"

112
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,936
then is the beginning
of "Stab 6" "Stab 5"?

113
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,646
And, if so,
what is "Stab 4" about?

114
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,107
- You're over-thinking it.
- Am I?

115
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,817
Or did whoever make it
just under-think it?

116
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,944
There's a reason
I don't watch these movies.

117
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,365
I can't believe you haven't seen them.
We live in Woodsboro.

118
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,825
That has nothing to do
with Woodsboro.

119
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,828
I... I thought you said "Stab"
was based on true stories.

120
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,915
The first three, the original trilogy,
is based off of Sidney Prescott,

121
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,918
but then she threatened to sue them
if they used her story,

122
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,920
so then they just started making
stuff up.

123
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,298
"Stab 5" has time travel,
which is by far the worst.

124
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,967
Don't we hear enough
about this story every year?

125
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,221
At least Woodsboro's known
for something.

126
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,015
(faint rattle)
Did you hear that?

127
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,226
Uh...

128
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,853
no, I didn't hear anything.

129
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:37,979
I did.

130
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,774
Jenny?

131
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,193
- Don't try to scare me.
- I'm not trying to scare you.

132
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,654
- You do it all the time.
- No, I don't.

133
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,698
- Where are you going?
- I told you, I heard something.

134
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,411
- I know you're trying to scare me.
- I'm not.

135
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,579
(faint thudding)

136
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,211
What is it?

137
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,256
I must have left a window
in my room open.

138
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,008
(telephone rings)

139
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,719
Could you get that?

140
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,388
- Marnie?
- Yeah.

141
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,141
(ringing continues)

142
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,934
(beep)

143
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,813
- Hello?
- (Ghostface) Hello. Who is this?

144
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,065
Marnie.
Who's this?

145
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,571
This is the last person
you're ever gonna see alive.

146
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,906
- What?
- (laughs)

147
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,577
(laughing) I'm sorry.

148
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,203
I had to.

149
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,456
(sigh) You bitch.

150
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,332
So not funny.

151
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,668
Somebody falls for it
every year.

152
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,837
I don't see why you get off on this sh...

153
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,380
(chokes, gasps)

154
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,090
(dial tone)
Marnie?

155
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,758
(crash)

156
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,011
(beep)
Marnie?

157
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,266
Marnie?

158
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,984
Good one, Marnie.
Lights out, phone on the floor?

159
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:10,864
You know,
you really should direct horror films.

160
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,658
Wherever you are.

161
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,244
(sighs) Let me guess.

162
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,832
You want me to walk by an open doorframe
so you can pop out, huh?

163
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,503
(telephone rings, gasps)

164
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,924
(chuckles) Okay, timing,
timing is perfect.

165
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,801
But you don't have the app
on your phone,

166
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,638
so you can't talk like Ghostface,
can you?

167
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,890
(Ghostface) Yes I can.

168
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,060
- Who is this?
- Not an app.

169
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,561
Is this Trevor?

170
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,648
Do I sound like a Trevor to you?
Think of me as your director.

171
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:48,318
You're in my movie.
You got a fun part, so don't blow it.

172
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,570
- What movie?
- Same one Marnie's in.

173
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,156
Only her part got cut way back.

174
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,034
But you, you're the dumb blonde
with the big tits.

175
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,954
We'll have some fun with you
before you die.

176
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:04,417
I have a 4.0 GPA and 135 IQ, asshole.
What did you do with Marnie?

177
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,295
- She's on the cutting room floor.
- That's not funny.

178
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,214
This isn't a comedy.
It's a horror film.

179
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,801
People live, people die.
And you'd better start running.

180
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,720
(screams)

181
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,764
(dog barking in distance)

182
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,516
Marnie?

183
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,268
(whimpers)

184
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,020
(screams)

185
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,817
(screaming)

186
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,948
(panting)

187
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,628
(screaming)

188
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,135
(grunts)

189
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,023
(garage door whirs)

190
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,363
(grunting and whimpering)

191
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,587
(screams, crunch)

192
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,968
(whimpering)

193
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:49,022
(screams)

194
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,233
(woman screams,
"Something To Die For" plays)

195
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:59,407
Working for another hour tonight

196
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,161
Staring at the wall
and let the time just pass me by

197
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,581
You might think you know me,
but it's all just a face

198
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,001
Trying to ignore
when people screaming my name

199
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,544
When something's right

200
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,882
Then something is worth to die for

201
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,593
When I feel
that something is wrong

202
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:23,014
Then something
is worth to fight for

203
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,475
Don't say goodbye

204
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,771
Just leave an open door

205
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,524
I wanna hear you say

206
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,820
You give me
something to die for...

207
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,531
What do you think?

208
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,282
Well,
I guess today is the anniversary.

209
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,953
- (sighs) Kids.
- No, I meant the display.

210
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,246
Oh. (chuckles)

211
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,627
It's good.

212
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,879
Told the owner I'd kill his cat
if he didn't get it right.

213
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,882
(chuckles) Nice.

214
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,051
(cell phone vibrating,
playing "Axel F")

215
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,183
(music stops)

216
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,749
(car alarm chirps)

217
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,757
(car approaching,
roach music blaring)

218
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,968
Ho! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
25, stay alive!

219
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,888
Shit.
Sorry, Sheriff!

220
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,099
Kirby.

221
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,893
(rock music continues)

222
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,186
Whoo.

223
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,653
(horn honks)

224
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,577
Hey, before you get in the car,
you have to promise not to kill me.

225
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,746
Why? What did you do?

226
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,499
- Trevor called me last night.
- Why is he calling you?

227
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,417
Because you won't take his calls.

228
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,961
He knows I have your ear,
and he wants to know.

229
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:20,340
- Know what?
- How upset you are.

230
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,383
Can we just not talk about this now,
please?

231
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,927
(softly) Fine. Fine.

232
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,513
Okay,
so Trevor called me last night.

233
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,097
He called you, too?

234
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,933
He's worried your cousin
coming to Woodsboro's

235
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,519
distracting you from knowing
how sorry he really is.

236
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,230
- Well, that's inventive.
- (chuckling) Oh, God.

237
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,065
(engine starts)

238
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,026
Problem with Trevor
is he never quits.

239
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,238
By the way, have you seen
the Grim Reaper, Angel of Death?

240
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,074
- What are you talking about?
- Your cousin.

241
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,076
- Sidney.
- Last stop on her book tour.

242
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,580
First stop on her road to a new life.
It's very dramatic.

243
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,874
She's the reason
why I love horror movies.

244
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,462
I'm sure she'd love to hear that.
If I knew her, which I don't really.

245
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:04,092
Wherever she went, people died.
Other people, it was never her.

246
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,094
I mean, "Stab"
is the wrong franchise for her.

247
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,887
It should be "Final Destination."
(cell phone rings)

248
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,889
Okay,
why is Jenny Randall calling me?

249
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,058
- Ooh, the other woman.
- Hello?

250
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,519
- (Ghostface) Hello, Jill.
- Can't stand Jenny.

251
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,814
Shh! Jenny?
Is this you?

252
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:21,526
- What's your favorite scary movie?
- Okay, who is this?

253
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,152
What does she want?

254
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:26,197
(beep)
I said, who is this?

255
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:30,910
(angrily) I asked you a question.
What's your favorite scary movie?

256
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,288
I'm hanging up.

257
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,455
(beep)

258
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,792
Wow. (chuckles)
That was original.

259
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,045
I got a call like that this morning
from Marnie the Carny.

260
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,297
What?

261
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,924
Watch out!
(horn blares, tires squeal)

262
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,260
(man) Nice move, asshole!

263
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:50,722
(panting) You just ran a stop sign.

264
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,349
Sorry.

265
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,978
- (sighs)
- Angel of Death.

266
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,397
(indistinct radio chatter)

267
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,277
(woman) The mayor wants these down
before lunch.

268
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:09,490
(man) Only twenty-five more to go.

269
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,368
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.

270
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,120
- Joe.
- Morning, Sheriff.

271
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:17,457
Looks like the celebration's begun.

272
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,168
- High school kids, probably.
- Yeah.

273
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,504
One generation's tragedy
is the next one's joke.

274
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,591
Sorry you can never get away
from this.

275
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,844
You know, I wish I'd been old enough
to be part of the force

276
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,638
when you were solving those crimes.

277
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,014
Why's that?

278
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,684
It's those intense investigations
that really bond relationships.

279
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,771
Well, yeah.

280
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,606
How is Gale, by the way?

281
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,400
Gale's good.
She's writing.

282
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,612
Fiction.
Or trying.

283
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,698
Hey, I made some lemon squares.
They're in my car.

284
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,701
Uh, thanks, Deputy,
but no thanks.

285
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:58,122
Sheriff, you're not cheatin' on your
wife if you eat my lemon square.

286
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,542
Yeah, but I would be cheatin'
on my diet.

287
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,962
(both laugh)
Sheriff Riley? Come in, Sheriff Riley!

288
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,089
This is Sheriff Riley.
Go ahead.

289
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,299
You gotta get over
to the Randall house right away.

290
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,677
It's bad, Sheriff, real bad.

291
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,766
(engine starts, sirens wail)

292
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,190
The book is "Out of Darkness,"

293
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,068
and its author, Sidney Prescott,
is here with us today.

294
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,363
Have the seven "Stab" movies,
all based on Gale Weathers' books

295
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,783
about you,
made it even harder to go on?

296
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,661
I don't blame Gale.
That's in the past.

297
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:41,666
If I was a victim for too long,
it was up to me to reinvent myself.

298
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,627
- That's why I wrote this book.
- Sidney Prescott, everybody.

299
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,922
And rave reviews for her book
"Out of Darkness."

300
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,882
All right, Gale, let's do it.

301
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,760
Let's reinvent myself.

302
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,804
(sighs)

303
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,598
Except...

304
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:04,772
"I have... no fucking idea...
what to... write."

305
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,190
(sighs)

306
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,700
Oh, is that new?

307
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,327
That's the 2.0 upgraded version.
I'm totally mobile now.

308
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,663
Nice. Look.

309
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,916
Oh, this is "Hall Pass"
with Robbie Mercer,

310
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,170
here with the luscious Olivia "Don't
look at my tits, I have a mind" Morris.

311
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,298
Here is my Woodsboro Massacre
anniversary question:

312
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,258
What is your favorite
scary movie?

313
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,761
Is that all you've got?
Some stupid douche question?

314
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,804
Yeah,
where'd you hear that anyways?

315
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,223
It's a line from "Stab One," duh.
Hey, Charlie.

316
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,518
You're a, a genre nut, Kirby.
What's your favorite scary movie?

317
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,895
"Bambi."

318
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,147
Dork. What?

319
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,107
That's funny, Kirby.

320
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,859
(girls chuckle)

321
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:53,738
- Completely unaware you exist.
- No, man, she wants me.

322
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,285
(chuckles) Yeah, I wish, right?
Asshole.

323
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,704
I think Charlie likes you.

324
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,581
And I like him.

325
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,542
To tease, to torment,
to make him squirm.

326
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,629
You could do a lot worse,
trust me.

327
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,798
- (gasps)
- Oh!

328
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,967
Hi, Trevor.
Bye, Trevor.

329
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,512
Can we talk?

330
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,932
Somebody cares about you over here,
you know?

331
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,643
Someone who made you
really happy once.

332
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,978
Someone who never
should have let you go.

333
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,899
When you're done with a phone call,
you let someone go.

334
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,693
Or when you take someone to the airport,
you let them go.

335
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,905
When you tell someone you love her,
she gives you everything,

336
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,740
and then you just go out
with someone else,

337
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,784
that is not letting her go,
that's dumping her, okay?

338
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,787
That's... that's betrayal.

339
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,331
(laughs) Trevor Sheldon,

340
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,084
denied live on "Hall Pass"
with Robbie Mercer.

341
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,086
What is your favorite scary movie,
man?

342
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,463
I'll show you. (snarls)

343
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,848
(Sidney) And I began to believe myself
that that was all I was,

344
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:06,769
a victim,
and that was unacceptable to me.

345
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,439
So, I sat down...

346
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,943
and began to write
a new role that would be my own,

347
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,280
a role for a woman who could leave
the walls of fear behind

348
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:20,741
and step out into the sunlight,
out of darkness.

349
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,870
(applause)
Thank you.

350
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,914
Okay, we're gonna start
the book signing in a sec.

351
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,710
So buy your copies while they last.
Lookin' at you, ladies.

352
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:34,964
New York Times bestseller.
Rave reviews.

353
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,550
Gale.
I'm glad you came.

354
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,676
Congratulations, Sidney.

355
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,262
I haven't had a chance
to read it yet, but...

356
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,473
I know where you can get one.
(chuckles)

357
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,187
Dewey! Hey!

358
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,439
Hey, Sid.
Gale, you made it.

359
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,191
(sirens wailing, tires screeching)
What are you doing here?

360
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,359
Sid, I'm sorry,
I gotta do something here.

361
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,361
- Shit!
- I'm really sorry.

362
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,822
Excuse me!
This will only take a minute.

363
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,159
I need you all to stay where you are
and remain silent.

364
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,952
Nobody leaves yet.
The Sheriff thanks you.

365
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,330
Can this wait, Barney Fife?
I'm running an event here.

366
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,333
- Ma'am, this is a police event now.
- What's going on?

367
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,085
Gale, this is police business.
If you could just let us handle this.

368
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,963
I'm talking to my husband,
Deputy Judy.

369
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,924
Listen, there's a phone we believe

370
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,926
may have been taken
from the scene of a crime.

371
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,763
Deputy Hicks has traced its location
back to these coordinates.

372
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,681
The rest is need-to-know.

373
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,310
- And I'm not "need-to-know"?
- Shh.

374
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,604
(cell phone ringing)
Hoss, I'm hearing something.

375
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,981
Sheriff, it's ringing out here!

376
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,777
(ringing continues)

377
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,986
There!

378
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,452
- It's coming from the trunk.
- There.

379
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,205
Dewey?
Gonna need everyone to stay back.

380
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,624
- Not now, Sid.
- It's my rental.

381
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,175
(all gasp)

382
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,678
Okay,
it's now an official crime scene.

383
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,513
Let's lock it down.
Get that camera outta here!

384
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,140
- Everybody back.
- Gimme that camera.

385
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,268
Please tell me this is a prank,
Dewey.

386
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,770
- I'm afraid not, Sid.
- On the curb, ma'am.

387
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,647
- Come on.
- Everybody, get back!

388
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,941
Henry, you're not gonna believe
what just happened.

389
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,985
Stand back, Gale. Gale.

390
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,736
I just wanna see.

391
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,780
(man) Cover up your kid's eyes!

392
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:26,117
Okay,
essays are due Tuesday.

393
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,869
"Why Woodsboro is the best..."
(multiple cell phones ringing)

394
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:33,124
Anything with an on/off switch
should be off, that's the rule!

395
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,584
Somebody wanna share?

396
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,254
Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper
were murdered last night.

397
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,423
- What?
- What?

398
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,841
Stabbed to death.

399
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,260
- What's your favorite scary...
- Shut up!

400
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,263
- Yo, it's a news van!
- Class is not over!

401
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,639
That was fast.

402
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,560
This week marks the anniversary
of the infamous Woodsboro Murders.

403
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:57,606
Two girls killed the exact day
local celebrity victim Sidney Prescott

404
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,442
chose to return to her hometown.

405
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,111
It all could be something right out
of a Gale Weathers best-seller.

406
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,779
And where is she now?

407
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,239
Well, living right here in Woodsboro...

408
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,908
- Mrs. Riley.
- Hoss.

409
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,953
- First Lady.
- Perkins.

410
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,122
Excuse me, Gale.
He's conducting an interview.

411
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,707
Great.
I love interviews.

412
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,460
You'll have to wait, Gale.
Sorry, can't let you in there.

413
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:21,047
(chuckles) What are you gonna do,
arrest me, Deputy Judy?

414
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,423
If it comes to it.

415
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,425
Civilian interference
with a police investigation

416
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,260
poses many a problem
in a court of law.

417
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,970
Okay, listen to me, Judy.

418
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,264
I don't mind that you're working
with my husband

419
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,517
or that you even bake him
those little treats as you do.

420
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,686
But if you're gonna start
acting like him,

421
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,772
you ought to put a moustache on
'cause you sound ridiculous.

422
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,231
- Gale!
- Judy!

423
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:43,527
- Gale! (clears throat)
- Deputy. Gale.

424
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,738
(whispering) Please.

425
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,074
Uh, Sidney,
if you don't mind givin' us a minute.

426
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,201
- Sid.
- Hi, Gale.

427
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,537
Dewey, would you please explain
to Betty Crocker

428
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,748
that I have every right to be here?

429
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,460
If there's been another murder
in Woodsboro, obviously... what?

430
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,088
(whispering)
That is not public information!

431
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,007
- It is all over the Internet, Dewey!
- It is?

432
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,052
Yes! The whole world knows
about it before me!

433
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,846
She wants to be a part
of the investigation, Sheriff.

434
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,765
(sighs) Hang on.

435
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:18,521
Um, are you familiar with the phrase,
"I wrote the book on this"?

436
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,444
Gale, with all due respect,
I don't see how that pertains to...

437
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,322
Because I wrote the book on this!

438
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,992
"The Woodsboro Murders"
by Gale Weathers?

439
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,537
But you're not a reporter anymore,
Gale.

440
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,038
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- And even if you were...

441
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,207
Don't treat me like I'm the media.

442
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:42,545
I helped solve these things three times,
remember?

443
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,422
You and me.
Together.

444
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,299
(sighs)
But I'm the Sheriff now, Gale.

445
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,719
Right?

446
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,139
What, you're not gonna let me
help you with this?

447
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,142
I can't.

448
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,519
All right,
then I'm going rogue.

449
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,063
This is what I'm good at,
Dewey.

450
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,984
This is what I know how to do.

451
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:09,155
(clears throat)

452
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,532
Your lemon squares taste like ass.

453
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,537
They don't.
They really don't.

454
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,746
Thank you, sir.

455
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,832
- Sheriff.
- Yeah?

456
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,584
We've got a couple
high school kids in here.

457
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,670
Two of 'em, they say they got
threatening phone calls this morning

458
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,422
from the victims' phones.

459
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,967
Names are Olivia Morris
and Jill Roberts.

460
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,262
That's Sid's cousin.
Damn.

461
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,681
Right in here, Sheriff.

462
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,808
- Hey, Jill.
- Sidney.

463
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,102
- Hi.
- Hi.

464
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,605
It's nice to see you
even under the circumstances.

465
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,690
(both chuckle)
You okay?

466
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,318
- Yeah.
- So two of you got phone calls?

467
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,946
Yeah, us two.
"What's your favorite scary movie?"

468
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,116
It was the killer's voice.
From "Stab."

469
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,827
Or, I mean, you know,
from your life.

470
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,371
I'm Kirby, by the way.
I'm their friend.

471
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,874
And the killer didn't call you?

472
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:05,961
No.
Is... is that a bad thing?

473
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,088
Does that mean that I'm not gonna
live as long as these two?

474
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,298
(chuckling) No.

475
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,508
Maybe.

476
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:14,178
Of course not.
Just, uh, just be careful.

477
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,473
Oh, my God, did you hear that?
I'm gonna be next!

478
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,642
Dewey, I shouldn't be here.
I should leave town.

479
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,810
I'm afraid that's not really possible,
Sidney.

480
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:27,358
Look, nobody thinks you're involved,
but everyone's a suspect, I'm sorry.

481
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,319
And there was evidence in your car,
connecting the killer to you.

482
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,946
You may be a material witness.

483
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,156
(sighs)

484
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:38,786
So, look, you'll have, uh,
24-hour police protection.

485
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,122
That's comforting.

486
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,958
(beep)
This is Rebecca.

487
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:48,254
Oh, my fucking God, Henry!
Yes! It's true.

488
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,674
Two girls butchered.
(chuckles) Payday.

489
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,469
I was so not feeling Woodsboro.
I was like, lame PR move, right?

490
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:59,974
Well, fuck me wow.
Best idea ever.

491
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,060
Henry, I'll call you back.
(beep)

492
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,187
Excuse me I have to geek out.

493
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,772
I didn't get a chance
to say something earlier,

494
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,440
but it's such an honor to meet you.

495
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,901
- Thank you. Hi.
- Rebecca Walters.

496
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,862
When I was a kid, it was all about
"Top Story with Gale Weathers."

497
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,283
- (chuckles) You were my '90s.
- Well, it's Gale Riley now.

498
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,034
You gave it all up for love,
I know that.

499
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,494
How long have you
and Dewey been married?

500
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,329
- Ten years.
- Aww!

501
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,665
Just like your characters
in "Stab 3." Wow.

502
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,500
Wow.

503
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,752
Oh, I didn't mean bad wow.

504
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,879
It just, it always seemed like more
of a movie romance than a real one

505
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,091
because it was a movie and in real life
you two would never be...

506
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:37,761
Ooh, dug a hole.
(chuckles nervously) Climbing out here.

507
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:41,724
So anyway kudos on being brave enough
to drop off the professional map.

508
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,685
Any plans on revitalizing
your tarnished brand?

509
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,604
Listen, in about two seconds,

510
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,607
I'm gonna revitalize your face
with my tarnished brand.

511
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,108
Ooh...

512
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,153
I still got it.

513
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,113
Testy.

514
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,540
She's so pretty.

515
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,001
When you think about what she survived,
she must have scars everywhere.

516
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,295
Shh!

517
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:15,549
Her mom was my sister.
I have scars, too.

518
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,344
No one ever asks me
about my scars.

519
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:22,222
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Roberts.
- She means knife scars, Mom.

520
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,016
Oh.

521
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,936
Well... fine.

522
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,356
How are you?

523
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,608
How's Gale?

524
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,736
Uh, I'm all right.

525
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,782
But Gale, it's been hard on her.

526
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:43,243
Small town...
small-town husband.

527
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,497
(chuckles humorlessly)
Not much to write about.

528
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:50,334
You two okay?

529
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,420
Well, I read somewhere once,

530
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,715
"Just when you think things can't
get any worse,

531
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,384
"sometimes they don't.

532
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,261
(chuckling)
Sometimes they get better."

533
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,556
"Out of Darkness" by Sidney Prescott,
page 220.

534
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,393
(both chuckle)

535
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:15,109
Gotta get going.

536
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:25,077
It's nice to see you, Dewey.
Been through a lot together.

537
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,788
And we'll get through this, too.
Okay?

538
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,748
- Lock up.
- Mm-hmm.

539
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,421
(indistinct radio chatter)

540
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,728
- (gasps)
- Be cool.

541
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,480
It's okay. It's just me.
Relax, relax. It's just me.

542
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,150
What the hell are you doing here?
There are cops right out front.

543
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,736
No match for the ninja, baby.

544
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,612
(sighs)

545
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,116
Anyway, what are you doing in the house
with Sidney Prescott?

546
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,577
I mean, that's like being on "Top Chef"
with Jeffrey Dahmer.

547
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,204
Can you please get away
from the window?

548
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,708
Y... You have no right to be in here.
Not anymore.

549
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,376
Hang on.

550
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,504
I heard you got a phone call
from the killer.

551
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,466
- Is that true?
- (sighs) What do you care?

552
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,552
Don't you think you'd be
a lot safer with me around?

553
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,846
I don't trust you Trevor.

554
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,222
Hey.

555
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,809
Then I'm just gonna have
to make sure that you do, all right?

556
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,562
(knock on door)

557
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,355
Oh, sorry, I didn't...

558
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,108
No, he's just leaving.
It's... it's my ex.

559
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,401
Oh.

560
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,279
Yeah.
Her one and only.

561
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,531
- Hi.
- Hi.

562
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,326
It's cool to meet you... officially.

563
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:52,498
I keep meaning to pick up a copy
of your book, but...

564
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,083
- You're smaller in person.
- (chuckles)

565
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,341
(chuckles softly)

566
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,634
What?

567
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:08,555
Nothing. You just, uh...
you remind me of, uh... me.

568
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,267
- (chuckles softly)
- Lock your window, okay?

569
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,269
Yeah. Good night.

570
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,647
'Night.

571
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,399
- (gasps)
- Sorry about that.

572
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,445
Just makin' my rounds
before takin' off.

573
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,156
Great. Thanks.

574
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:30,244
Y... You don't remember me,
do ya?

575
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,745
Sorry?

576
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,541
We went to high school together.
Judy Hicks?

577
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:39,753
We had the same homeroom
and Drama Club, too.

578
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:43,924
We were in "Peter Pan" together.
I played a Lost Boy.

579
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:48,011
You were... Tiger Lily.

580
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:53,100
I'm sorry,
that was a long time ago.

581
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,602
It's okay.

582
00:30:55,687 --> 00:31:00,190
You had a lot of stuff goin'
on back then.

583
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,694
Well, it's nice to see you again,
Judy.

584
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:04,862
You too.

585
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,030
(door opens,
indistinct radio chatter)

586
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,700
(clears throat)

587
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:13,996
- (clears throat)
- (man) Everything okay upstairs?

588
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,417
You're supposed to be out front,
Perkins.

589
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,586
(pop music playing on radio)

590
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,718
What's a 4-letter word
for "courage"?

591
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,970
Uh...

592
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,263
"guts."

593
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,896
That's Olivia Morris.
She lives next door.

594
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,940
She's on the list.

595
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,359
She can live next door to me.

596
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,112
Now, seriously, uh...
uh, Mary,

597
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,197
I'm warning you, okay,
I'm gonna have to get physical.

598
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,617
- I mean it. This is it!
- (snarling)

599
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,327
Just fuck off!

600
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,786
(growling)

601
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,830
(girls laugh)

602
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,999
(cell phone rings)

603
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,755
Hello?

604
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,256
What are you guys up to?

605
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,383
Oh,
we're watching "Shaun of the Dead."

606
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,053
You know there are two zombies
sitting outside the house in a car?

607
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,222
Yup. They're cops.
You wanna come up?

608
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,515
The Angel of Death leave?

609
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,768
No, she's in the guest room.
(chuckles)

610
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,896
Forget it.
Next door's close enough.

611
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,483
- Your mom home?
- She's at her boyfriend's.

612
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,360
It's creepy around here tonight.

613
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,737
Well, the zombies
are still in their car.

614
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,907
So you should be all right.

615
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,451
- Call me tomorrow, okay?
- All right.

616
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,746
- She didn't wanna come up?
- She fears the Reaper.

617
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,832
Watch this.

618
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,502
(beep, cell phone dials)

619
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,963
(cell phone rings)

620
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,925
(beep)
Speaking.

621
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:54,137
(imitating Ghostface) What's
your favorite scary movie, Olivia?

622
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,640
That's the worst imitation
I've ever heard, Jill.

623
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,976
Speaking of "Stab," you heard
where the Stab-a-Thon's gonna be yet?

624
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,311
(beep)
No, and it doesn't matter to me anyways.

625
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,397
My mom doesn't let me go.

626
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,983
(cell phone rings)
(sighs) It's Trevor.

627
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:10,070
- I'll handle this.
- Trevor's calling. Again.

628
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,407
- What do you want?
- (Ghostface) I wanna talk to Jill.

629
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,826
Uh, no, it's Kirby.
Sorry, Trevor.

630
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,079
Jill is screening her calls
from all past relationships.

631
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,247
What's going on over there?

632
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,499
Hang on a sec.
What is he saying?

633
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,376
(whispers) I'm not Trevor.

634
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,587
Wh... what?
I can barely hear you, Trevor.

635
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,132
This isn't Trevor.

636
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,550
Oh, a... all right.

637
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,845
Well, then, why do you have his phone,
whoever this is?

638
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,180
(whispering)
He's trying to do Ghostface.

639
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,641
(chuckles) He's being weird.

640
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,393
I wanna talk to Jill.

641
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:44,229
Okay, well,
she doesn't wanna talk to you.

642
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,314
Come on, Mr. Ghostface,
whisper to me.

643
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,568
Aren't you supposed
to ask me a question?

644
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,320
All right.
How's the movie?

645
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,655
What movie?

646
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,992
"Shaun of the Dead."

647
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,618
How did you know that?

648
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,205
Because I'm standing
in the closet.

649
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,041
Stop. You are not.

650
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,585
- What's going on?
- Trevor's being weird.

651
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,754
- I mean, if it is him, I don't know.
- What?

652
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,756
This is not fucking Trevor!

653
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,799
Well then,
who the fuck are you?

654
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,968
Open the closet door.

655
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,848
You do know there are cops
all over this house?

656
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:23,935
I think I'd have just enough time
to slice someone open.

657
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,190
- I-I'll talk to him.
- Shh.

658
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,567
What's going on over there,
you guys?

659
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,695
S... Sorry.
I... I don't know. Kirby.

660
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,238
- Shh.
- Kirby.

661
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,823
Come on, do it.

662
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,950
There is no way you're in there.

663
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,536
See for yourself.

664
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,330
Kirby?

665
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,750
Kirby, come on. Talk to me.
This isn't funny.

666
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,460
Kirby!

667
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,879
(gasps)

668
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,511
Liar. I'm over this.

669
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,097
I never said I was in your closet.

670
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:08,021
- (screaming)
- Oh, my God. Olivia!

671
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,733
- (screaming)
- Oh, my God, help!

672
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,361
Aaagh! (gasping)

673
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,162
No! Help!

674
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:28,375
(Olivia screaming)

675
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,918
(grunting and panting)

676
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,680
- Hoss!
- Somebody help!

677
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,765
- Perkins!
- (Olivia screams)

678
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,144
Shit!

679
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,313
Help! Help!

680
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,399
(girls screaming)

681
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,409
(both screaming)

682
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,044
(panting, door creaks)

683
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,144
(gasps)

684
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:39,112
(cell phone rings)

685
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,115
(beep)
What?

686
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,702
(Ghostface) Welcome home, Sidney.
Preview of coming events.

687
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,913
Why don't you come for me?
You got the balls for that?

688
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,540
Oh, poor Sidney.
You think this is all about you.

689
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,877
- You think you're still the star.
- This isn't a fucking movie!

690
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,962
- It will be.
- These are innocent people.

691
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,297
(angrily) Spare me the lecture.

692
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,133
You've done very well
by all this bloodshed, haven't you?

693
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,385
Well, how about
the town you left behind?

694
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,221
I've got plans for you.

695
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,806
I'm gonna slit your eyelids in half
so you don't blink

696
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,059
when I stab you in the face.

697
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:12,854
You'll die when I want you to, Sidney.
Not a moment before.

698
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,982
Until then...
you're going to suffer.

699
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,359
(click)

700
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,486
- Sidney?!
- Jill?

701
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,530
- Stay right there!
- Is she...

702
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,741
Do not look. Okay?

703
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,410
She said
you were the Angel of Death.

704
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,496
- Look out!
- (screams)

705
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,873
(grunting and panting)

706
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,812
- What's going on in here?
- He's in here.

707
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:57,816
Where is he?
Ma'am?

708
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,362
- He was.
- We'll check out back.

709
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,365
- Jill?
- (breathes heavily) Don't.

710
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,543
- What happened?
- (Jill whimpering)

711
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,713
Oh, my God, Jill.

712
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:25,135
Jesus! I'm here. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go. All right?

713
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,929
Jill?

714
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,223
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

715
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,351
- Here, keep pressure on it.
- There's nobody back there.

716
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,479
- Hoss, call it in.
- Right.

717
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:40,942
Hey.
Are you okay?

718
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,819
You should look upstairs.

719
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,079
(indistinct conversations)

720
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:57,584
(woman) Let's get the coroner's van
brought around, please.

721
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,753
(indistinct radio chatter)

722
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,299
(woman) It's all your fault, Sidney!

723
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,593
(man) You're just like your mother!

724
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,053
- Hoss, clear these people out.
- Right.

725
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:12,932
- (woman) I thought this was over!
- Come on, leave her alone.

726
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:20,190
I'm sorry about what I said.

727
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,609
Do you wanna go get that looked at?

728
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:26,029
Yeah.

729
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,822
What the hell happened?

730
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,576
Okay. I saw him go into that yard
two houses down right before...

731
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,953
Yeah, and I circled around
to cut him off.

732
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,205
And?

733
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,707
And I met Hoss coming
from the other direction.

734
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,668
He must've circled back around somehow.
He's like a ghost.

735
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,214
- Chief, we're sorry.
- We feel terrible.

736
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:47,300
(sighs) All right.
Get outta here.

737
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,015
(siren wails)

738
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:05,318
This is "Hall Pass" with Robbie Mercer,
webcasting live in our darkest hour.

739
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,279
What began as a day of remembrance
has ended with serial murder.

740
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:12,534
Olivia Morris, who officially
will never go out with me, is dead.

741
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,869
So is Jenny Randall
and Marnie Cooper.

742
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,706
Our local legacy, the "Stab" movies,
is coming to life.

743
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,709
Excuse me.
Are you recording with that thing?

744
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,546
Live video-blog upload.
He's webcasting right now.

745
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,965
Oh. Mind turning it off
for a little old-school off the record?

746
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,259
Can't.
Owe it to my audience.

747
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,177
Turn that fucking thing off.

748
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,720
Okay.

749
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:37,809
So, you two are the boys that run
the movie club at Woodsboro High, huh?

750
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:41,020
Charlie runs it.
I'm just V.P. In case he takes a bullet.

751
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,564
It's called Cinema Club.

752
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:47,527
So you must have a very unique insight
into the movie buffs at your school.

753
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,362
Maybe.

754
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:53,491
What if we could catch the killer
by working together?

755
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,119
Two generations
of cutting-edge journalists

756
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:59,330
intertwining our passions for media?

757
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,541
What would you say?

758
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,876
I love you.

759
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,502
Very good.

760
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:08,548
Now you give me your expertise
on the gore geek scene at Woodsboro High

761
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,301
and maybe
I give you something in return.

762
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,721
Say, a celebrity visit
to your Cinema Club?

763
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,474
By me.

764
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:21,519
What about Sidney?

765
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,522
Yeah, you know her, right?
I mean, you're friends with her?

766
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,442
No offense, but that'd be a big deal
for Cinema Club.

767
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,320
A visit from Sidney Prescott?
I mean, she's the star.

768
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:34,824
(chucked bitterly) Yes, she's
Daniel Radcliffe to my J.K. Rowling.

769
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,452
Well, without the book sales
and the box office.

770
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,829
Whatever.

771
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,374
There's no broken bones.

772
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,919
I think you'll be fine.
Take it easy.

773
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:49,422
You were lucky, Sidney.

774
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,133
So, Sidney, ooh, ow.

775
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,135
(chuckles)
Anyway, long story short,

776
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,514
Random wants to lock you in
to three more books now.

777
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:01,100
See the blank line in your contract?
You can name your price.

778
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,186
And as soon as you're clear
in this investigation,

779
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,896
we're on the next plane to New York.

780
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,524
I booked "Today," "The View,"
"Nancy Grace," "MTV News"...

781
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,526
Excuse me.
Can I ask you a question?

782
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,695
- Mm?
- Did you read my book?

783
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,698
Thought I'd wait for the movie.

784
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,700
Book tour's over.

785
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,536
Sidney.

786
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,038
Accept your situation.

787
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,290
You're a victim.
For life.

788
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,502
So embrace it, use it.

789
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,004
I know
you care about your readers.

790
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:32,131
All those little downtrodden fucks
that just need a light

791
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,425
at the end of their tunnel
so they don't jump off a bridge.

792
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,969
And a lucky break like this?

793
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,888
I'm talkin' 100% increase in sales,
minimum.

794
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,307
That's maybe a million more people
get your message,

795
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,185
and you get a ton more checks,
win-win.

796
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,022
(exhales)
I won't be needing you anymore.

797
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,024
- Sidney.
- You're fired.

798
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,318
- Fired?
- Fired.

799
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,780
Fine.

800
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,282
(sighs)

801
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,040
(running footsteps)

802
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,797
(elevator dings)

803
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:19,095
"Have you even read my book,
Rebecca?"

804
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,264
(clunk)

805
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,647
(clunk, elevator whirs)

806
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,275
(sighs softly)

807
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,694
The problem with Sidney
is that she never gets laid.

808
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,989
Or even a little shit-faced
once in a while.

809
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,158
She'll call me tonight and apologize.

810
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,702
(elevator dings)
Just watch.

811
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,376
She'll come around.

812
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:55,048
Gotta just give her time,
and Sidney will come around.

813
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,010
Where did I?

814
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,638
(car alarm chirps)

815
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,806
Ah.
(cell phone rings)

816
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,936
(beep)
This is Rebecca.

817
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,064
(Ghostface) Sidney Prescott, please.

818
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,358
I'm handling Miss Prescott's calls
and appearances.

819
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,944
- May I take a message?
- You are the message.

820
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,077
- Are you writing this down?
- Yes, I am.

821
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,537
It's kind of hard to hear you.
I'm in the hospital with Sidney.

822
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,706
If you could just hang on one second.

823
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:32,126
(chuckles) I've got time.
It's you that doesn't.

824
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,344
(car alarm blares)
You know, Rebecca,

825
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,389
it doesn't sound to me
like you're in the hospital.

826
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,642
Sounds like you're in a parking garage.

827
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:51,354
A dark
and deserted parking garage.

828
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,526
But if you want to be in the hospital,
I'd be happy to put you there.

829
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,569
In the fucking morgue!

830
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,204
(door locks click)

831
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,586
(cell phone rings)
Ah!

832
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,633
No.
(ringing stops)

833
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,135
(keys jingling)

834
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,265
(engine cranks)

835
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,862
(screams)

836
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,910
Help! Help!

837
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,787
Help me!
(tires squeal)

838
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:51,581
Help!

839
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,804
Cut and run,
you fucking bastard.

840
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,021
(door locks click)

841
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,922
(car alarm blaring)
(screams)

842
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,529
(screams)

843
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,917
This is an ongoing investigation.

844
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:22,296
Rest assured,
we're pursuing a number of leads.

845
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,715
The less I say about that,
the better.

846
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,678
- So I'm taking questions.
- Sheriff! Sheriff!

847
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,513
- Dewey!
- Gale?

848
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,682
Any comment on the fact
that these killings

849
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:36,185
seem to resemble the pattern
of the original Woodsboro Murders?

850
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,271
Hon? (whispers) Later.

851
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,231
(woman) What was that, Sheriff?

852
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:44,443
As I was saying, uh,
my officers are hard at work,

853
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,155
and we just want the community
to know that we are very close

854
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,700
to bringing this whole situation
under control...

855
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,118
- (woman screams)
- Agh!

856
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,745
(crowd screaming)

857
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,915
(man) Oh, shit!

858
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,168
Someone, get up to the top
of the structure! Go, go!

859
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,297
- Everyone back! Stay back!
- All right, nobody move!

860
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,215
Listen,
I want a man on each stairwell!

861
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,971
- You see anybody?
- Nobody up here.

862
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,432
There's nobody up there,
Sheriff!

863
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,727
It's all under control,
huh, Sheriff?

864
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,937
What am I supposed to say?

865
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,231
Listen,
I may not be wearing a uniform,

866
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,609
but I happen to have a lead,
and you don't.

867
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:28,738
So let me know when you're back
on Team Gale.

868
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:33,326
Move it, amateurs!

869
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,328
(over PA) And remember, students,

870
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,581
tonight's town curfew is 9:00.

871
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:42,585
You should be home with your doors
locked at 9:00.

872
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,921
Okay, Cinema Club.
We are now in session.

873
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,965
Welcome.
Tell you a little bit about ourselves.

874
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,885
We are a sanctioned
after-school activity,

875
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:55,014
one rung below the Glee Club,
two above Nintendo Wii Fit.

876
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:59,310
And (chuckles) let me just say
to our guest, Sidney Prescott,

877
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,895
it's an honor.

878
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,397
(applause)

879
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,192
Beyond Jamie Lee Curtis,
forget Linda Blair.

880
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,486
I mean, this is the ultimate.

881
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,196
Thanks. I guess.

882
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,782
Um this,
you film your entire

883
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,034
high school experience and,
what, post it on the net?

884
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,994
Everybody'll be doing it someday, Sid.

885
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,830
It's kind of the one component
the killer is missing.

886
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,832
Wait.
What do you mean?

887
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,918
Well, if you wanna be
the new version,

888
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,253
the killer
should be filming the murders.

889
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:29,382
It's like the natural next step
in a psycho slasher innovation.

890
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,968
I mean, you film 'em all real-time,
and then before you get caught,

891
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,346
- you upload 'em into cyberspace.
- Making your art as immortal as you.

892
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,474
- Not to implicate him.
- Not to implicate me.

893
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,476
So who do you think
is behind the murders?

894
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,313
(beep)
Well, it's a "Stab" fanatic clearly.

895
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:47,149
Working on less of a shriekquel and...
and more of a scream-make.

896
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,694
- Copyrighted terms, by the way.
- 'Cause all there are now are remakes.

897
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,238
Only horror the studios green-light.
I mean

898
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:53,489
- Psst.
- There are still rules.

899
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,701
But the rules have changed.
The unexpected is the new clich.

900
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:59,662
Yeah, you gotta have an opening sequence
that blows the doors off,

901
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,831
dial up some flashy
music-video direction,

902
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,624
and the kills gotta be
way more extreme.

903
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,752
Modern audiences get savvy
to the rules of the originals.

904
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,671
So the reversals
become the new standard.

905
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:12,216
In fact, the only surefire way
to survive a modern horror movie?

906
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:16,887
You pretty much have to be gay.
(light chuckling)

907
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,933
So why are you so sure that the killer's
working by the rules of a horror remake?

908
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,310
Well, the original "Stab" structure
is pretty apparent.

909
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,855
Yeah, two kids killed in a house
when their parents are away?

910
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,649
And then the school's hot chick
savaged beyond recognition.

911
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:31,068
- We all know where it goes from there.
- A party.

912
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:34,155
Exactly. A party.

913
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,365
Guaranteed third-act
main cast bloodbath.

914
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,325
Fingers crossed
on some nudity for a change.

915
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,494
(light laughter)

916
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,080
Okay, so do you know of a party
that's happening tonight?

917
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,625
Well, there's Stab-a-Thon.

918
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,794
Stab-a-Thon?

919
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,213
Uh, it's a movie marathon.
All seven "Stabs" back-to-back.

920
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,966
- We do it every year.
- And it's tonight?

921
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,010
(scoffs) There's a killer out there

922
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,262
patterning his murders
after the original movie.

923
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,847
I know.
It's pretty wild.

924
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:03,517
- Well, you have to call it off.
- Um, okay, I mean, it's Friday.

925
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,729
I'm sure we're not the only party
that's goin' on in Woodsboro.

926
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:08,856
Where is this circle jerk
gonna take place?

927
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,277
- So who's ready for this Q and A?
- No, no. I really want the location.

928
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,279
You know,
it's kind of an underground thing.

929
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,073
Email invites, pretty secret.

930
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,283
(chuckles)
What, you're not gonna tell me?

931
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,993
Really?

932
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,789
We're working together.
Remember?

933
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,749
(swallows)
So you ready for that Q and A?

934
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:30,544
- Fuck you.
- Let's go.

935
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,047
(door opens, closes)

936
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,882
(chuckles softly)
That was awesome.

937
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,383
(talking indistinctly)

938
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:40,179
(sighs)
I feel like I'm under house arrest.

939
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:58,948
You know when people say,
"I know how you feel,"

940
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:02,076
but you know they're just saying that
because they really have

941
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,745
no frigging idea how you feel?

942
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,835
I know how you feel.

943
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:15,422
I... am so sorry about Olivia.

944
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,513
I'm sorry about your publicist.

945
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:32,148
How do you handle it?
People staring at you all the time?

946
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,525
People stare at me?

947
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,235
(both chuckle)

948
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,487
I could never handle
that kind of attention.

949
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:44,326
I just... feel like it would take over
your whole life.

950
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,329
Uh...

951
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,832
what I do is I...

952
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:54,628
try not to think about me.

953
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:59,383
I have people I care about.
I focus on them.

954
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:02,678
And the rest, it, um,
it works out.

955
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,475
You saved my life last night.

956
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,354
I mean, I know we're family,
but you hardly know me.

957
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,273
Makes me wonder, you know,

958
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:18,611
if I'd have been brave enough
to do the same thing.

959
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,989
I really hope
you never have to find that out.

960
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,829
Well, if you need me,
you know where to find me.

961
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,208
I'll be up in my cell.
Or, I mean, my room.

962
00:53:56,149 --> 00:54:00,152
Her room's all boarded up.
That's the view from my cell.

963
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,613
(sighs) It's really weird.

964
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,240
(Kirby) I think Olivia
would understand, okay?

965
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,492
She'd want me to be
around other people.

966
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,410
Holy shit.

967
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,247
Even if I did just crash-land
on Planet Dork.

968
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,458
Speaking of which,
Trevor's here.

969
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,043
Hey, Kirby.

970
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,420
What is he doing there?
That is so not his scene.

971
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,215
I have no idea.
Maybe he thought you would be here.

972
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,425
Yeah, fat chance.
After what happened last night?

973
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,970
I mean, my mom
is just completely freaked out.

974
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,471
- It's not pretty.
- All right, look.

975
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:30,557
You go do your "good girl" thing,
and I will drink for the both of us.

976
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:35,271
- I will keep you posted.
- All right. Be safe.

977
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,190
(rock music playing,
indistinct conversations)

978
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,980
(crowd chanting in unison) Stab-a-thon!
Stab-a-thon! Stab-a-thon!

979
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:21,066
Stab-a-thon! Stab-a-thon!

980
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,527
(cheers and applause)

981
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:26,030
Thank you! Thank you!
Gracias.

982
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,157
Shh.

983
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,869
Cinema Club thanks you for coming out
for our third annual Stab-a-thon.

984
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,537
(cheers and applause)
Safety in numbers, my friends!

985
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:36,332
Who's ready to drink every time
someone can't get a cell phone signal?

986
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,791
(cheers and applause)

987
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,711
Who's ready to drink every time
someone shuts the refrigerator door,

988
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:43,130
and oh, my God, there's a harmless
character right behind it?

989
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,049
(hooting and cheering)

990
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,634
Who's ready to drink every time
someone screams the word...

991
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,136
(all) No!

992
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,097
So let's get
this Stab-a-thon started!

993
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,350
(cheers and applause)

994
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,560
(eerie music plays)

995
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:07,237
(cheers and applause)

996
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:10,783
- Hey, watch it!
- Get out of the way!

997
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,870
- Down in front!
- Move your ass!

998
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:20,125
Screw you!
(angry shouting)

999
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,337
(dramatic music playing,
audience hooting)

1000
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,978
(glass shatters,
audience cheering)

1001
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,536
(softly) Yes.

1002
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,289
(thunder crashes,
audience cheers)

1003
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:03,419
Oh, yeah.
Back on my game.

1004
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,629
(exhales) Perfect.

1005
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:08,424
New work-in-progress,
chapter one.

1006
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:12,136
When I moved to Woodsboro,
I never in a million years dreamed

1007
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,431
that I would again play
the critical role

1008
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:18,434
in solving another series of these...

1009
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,144
What?

1010
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,110
What the hell?

1011
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:50,674
(cell phone rings)

1012
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,468
Gale, where are you?

1013
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,845
I followed the kids
to the Stab-a-thon.

1014
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,973
There's an old abandoned farm
on Fort Dillon Road.

1015
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,475
Listen, I've got it
under surveillance,

1016
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,894
and I... I think the killer's
about to make his move.

1017
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,604
What makes you so sure?

1018
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:06,565
You do a remake
to out-do the original,

1019
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,275
that's what the kids said.

1020
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,319
This party
is all about the "Stab" movies.

1021
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,738
Come on!
How meta can you get?

1022
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,907
How "what-a" can you get?

1023
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,034
I don't know.
I heard them say it.

1024
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:20,078
Dewey, listen to me,
you have to get out here.

1025
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,164
Come on, you catch the killer,
I get the story.

1026
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,415
It's a win-win.

1027
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,001
Well, I thought you were going rogue,
Gale.

1028
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:29,087
Oh, co... are you serious?
Come on!

1029
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,174
(exhales) Forget it.
Thanks for having faith in me.

1030
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:34,259
I gotta fix my equipment.
(beep)

1031
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,552
Gale!

1032
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,056
Shit.

1033
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,267
(siren wails)

1034
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,482
(man) Why don't you get
more comfortable, baby?!

1035
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:51,360
(light cheering)

1036
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,403
(cheers and applause)

1037
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,698
Bravo.
Well... very well done.

1038
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,617
Very, I'm very impressed.

1039
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,954
I mean, kind... kind of impressed.
Not really.

1040
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,205
- That'll do.
- Yeah?

1041
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,706
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she wants it, right?

1042
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:07,918
(telephone rings)

1043
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:11,713
(audience groans)

1044
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,508
(cheers and applause)
Ghostface! Yeah!

1045
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,677
(ringing continues)

1046
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,681
(woman) Don't answer it!

1047
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:26,353
- Hello?
- (Ghostface) Hello.

1048
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:27,896
Who is this?

1049
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,648
(audience talking along)
Were you expecting somebody?

1050
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,108
No.

1051
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,490
(indistinct radio chatter)

1052
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,534
(audience talking along)
You know, I don't even know you,

1053
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,035
and I dislike you already.

1054
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,413
Hicks, how far are you
from Fort Dillon Road?

1055
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,915
- Five minutes at the most, sir.
- Well, step on it.

1056
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,875
(tense music playing)

1057
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,794
Look out your window.

1058
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:53,505
(audience screaming)

1059
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,360
(camera whirring)

1060
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,675
Gale!
Gale, behind you!

1061
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,052
Aah!

1062
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,387
(grunts)
(audience cheering)

1063
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,730
Aah!

1064
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,483
(grunts)

1065
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,526
Gale!

1066
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,697
(woman onscreen screaming)

1067
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:10,749
Aah!

1068
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,042
Freeze!

1069
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:17,047
Aaah!

1070
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,924
(Gale grunts)

1071
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:25,722
(audience screaming)

1072
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,517
Get out of the way,
you morons!

1073
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,564
Damn it.

1074
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,736
Okay, put pressure on that.

1075
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,697
Did you catch him?

1076
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,116
No. Hopefully your cameras
caught something.

1077
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,702
- They weren't the only ones Dewey.
- What?

1078
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,162
There's a webcam that's hidden
up there.

1079
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:52,374
- It was watching me.
- A webcam?

1080
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,251
He's recording the murders.

1081
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:55,502
What?

1082
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:59,089
This time...
he's making the movie.

1083
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:08,265
Sidney Prescott detail, man.
I don't... like it.

1084
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:11,852
The cops guarding the house,
they always get it.

1085
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:14,771
- What are you talkin' about?
- It's a movie cop rule.

1086
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:18,358
Sucks to be a cop in a movie,
unless you're Bruce Willis.

1087
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:20,444
Not all cops die in movies.

1088
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:25,073
No, but if it's your last day
before retirement, you do.

1089
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,952
If you're a rookie just found out
your wife is pregnant, you do.

1090
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:32,831
Or if your partner's better-looking
than you, you do, and by the way...

1091
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,291
(both) I win that one.

1092
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,084
(chuckles)

1093
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,878
You know what?
I'll take the next perimeter.

1094
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:40,088
I'll be right back.

1095
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:44,259
Shit.
I know this one.

1096
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:45,969
You're not supposed to say that,
are you?

1097
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,429
Eh, new decade, new rules.

1098
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:50,265
You know, these days,
you might come back, find me dead,

1099
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,517
eyes gouged out,
tongue sticking out.

1100
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,936
- Could go either way.
- I gotta learn this shit.

1101
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:58,648
(chuckles) I'll take this one.

1102
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,901
Hey, Hoss.

1103
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:03,111
Be careful.

1104
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,113
I'm always careful.

1105
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,994
Dead man walking.

1106
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,961
(cat yowls, meows)

1107
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,130
(wind chimes tinkling)

1108
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,505
Perkins, was there a window open
on your last perimeter check?

1109
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:09,427
Perkins, come in, over.

1110
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,596
(dog barking in distance)

1111
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:41,585
(whispers) Anthony?

1112
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:45,005
Perkins?

1113
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:46,423
- Aaah!
- Ohh!

1114
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:49,551
- (laughs)
- Damn it.

1115
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:52,804
You should've seen the look
on your face, rookie.

1116
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,265
- (strangled grunt)
- Hoss!

1117
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:57,559
What the fuck? Aah!

1118
01:04:57,643 --> 01:05:00,520
Oh, shit.

1119
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,689
(grunting)

1120
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:19,456
(dogs barking in distance)

1121
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:30,967
Fuck Bruce Willis.

1122
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,598
(wind chimes tinkling)

1123
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:01,706
Sorry!
The wind chimes were over here.

1124
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,834
That was me.
I was trying to fix 'em, sorry.

1125
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,212
I'm just back from the store.

1126
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,005
You're shopping?

1127
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:12,008
My stress buster.
Got one more bag in the car.

1128
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,510
Be right back.

1129
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,065
(telephone ringing)

1130
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:42,372
Jill?
You gonna get that?

1131
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,668
(beep)
Roberts residence.

1132
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,962
(Ghostface) You're a survivor,
aren't you, Sidney?

1133
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:52,173
Your one and only skill.
You survive.

1134
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,592
I have one question for you.

1135
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:57,470
What good's it to be a survivor
in this little drama

1136
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,764
if everyone close to you is dead?

1137
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,517
- Who are you?
- Turn on the TV to channel 6.

1138
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,144
Who the fuck are you?

1139
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:07,605
Turn it on.
Watch the teaser.

1140
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:11,484
...nearly turned deadly tonight
with the latest victims of these attacks

1141
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:15,155
being the wife of the Woodsboro sheriff,
Gale Riley,

1142
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:19,534
AKA Gale Weathers who's in serious
condition tonight after being stabbed.

1143
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:22,746
Her assailant then disappeared
in a sea of identic...

1144
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:26,416
(laughs) Glad you came home, Sidney?
Has it been worth it yet?

1145
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,002
- Why are you doing this?
- Ah, friends count.

1146
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:32,422
But it's the family ties
that cut deep, right?

1147
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:34,132
Am I right?

1148
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,633
What do you mean?

1149
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,594
(chuckles)
The ones you care about most.

1150
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:41,139
And what's closer than family?
The bond of blood.

1151
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,433
- Don't.
- You can't save them.

1152
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:47,062
All you can do is watch.
(laughs)

1153
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,354
Jill!

1154
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:00,909
Come on, come on...

1155
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,041
Kate?

1156
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:09,834
- Sid?
- Jill's not in her room.

1157
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,377
- Oh, my God.
- She's gone to Kirby's.

1158
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:12,837
You gotta call her
and get her back here.

1159
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,173
Okay.
(beep)

1160
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:16,508
(telephone rings)
Come on, Jill.

1161
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,927
- Leave a message.
- She's not picking up.

1162
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,096
- What's going on?
- The killer called.

1163
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,556
He's coming after me,
but he wants my family first.

1164
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:25,433
- Oh, God, Jill!
- Let's get the cops.

1165
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,102
- The cops aren't there.
- What?

1166
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,479
They were there when I first came in,
but they're not there now.

1167
01:08:29,563 --> 01:08:31,856
Let's get to Kirby's.

1168
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:36,361
Out the front.

1169
01:08:39,865 --> 01:08:42,367
(gasps, screams)

1170
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:44,494
(both grunting)

1171
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:47,288
Brace it from the bottom.
Can you?

1172
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:54,337
(pounding on door)
Let's get outta here.

1173
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:56,965
- (thud, grunts)
- (whispering) Kate, come on!

1174
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:58,508
Kate?

1175
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:12,981
Tell Jill... I'm so... sorry.

1176
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:15,191
Shh.

1177
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,370
Kate?

1178
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:45,054
Hicks?
What are you doing?

1179
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,724
I just saw somebody coming around
the side of the house.

1180
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:49,767
Where are Hoss and Perkins?
I couldn't get them on the radio.

1181
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,145
Whose blood is that?

1182
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:55,607
It's... it's Kate's.
We were just attacked.

1183
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,609
- She's dead.
- Where is she?

1184
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,736
- Front door.
- Show me.

1185
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:00,862
Okay.

1186
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:07,577
- Stay here.
- Okay.

1187
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:14,250
(radio clicks)
This is Deputy Hicks.

1188
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,586
I've got a homicide
at the Roberts residence.

1189
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,589
- No sign of Perkins or Hoss.
- Copy that, we'll try to locate them.

1190
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:22,967
I'm so sorry...

1191
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,261
(tires squealing)

1192
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,807
Hey!

1193
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:32,435
Halt!

1194
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:36,147
You're gonna be fine, all right?
I swear.

1195
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,857
No more "on your own."

1196
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:39,567
It's you and me, forever.

1197
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,903
One, two, three.
(grunts)

1198
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:44,113
Easy.

1199
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,241
- Dewey?
- Yeah?

1200
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:49,285
Promise me somethin'.

1201
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,453
Anything.

1202
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:53,831
(exhales)
Catch that motherfucker.

1203
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,793
Absolutely.
I love you.

1204
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:59,045
I love you.

1205
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:03,299
You missed chaos.
Utter chaos.

1206
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:06,344
- I can't believe that.
- The sheriff's wife, man!

1207
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,471
She told us to cancel it,
and we didn't, and now this?

1208
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:10,265
- What are we supposed to do?
- Robbie, calm down.

1209
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:12,850
It makes sense.
This is what the re-boots do.

1210
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,644
They... they one-up the original ending.

1211
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:17,897
The Woodsboro Murders ended at a party.
So in the remake...

1212
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:20,608
The party's the false ending.
New rules.

1213
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,568
Exactly.

1214
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,904
Okay, no offense, guys,
but I'm gonna put in "Stab 7."

1215
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,699
- Nobody cancels my film festival.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1216
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,909
I don't wanna watch that,
not after what happened to Olivia.

1217
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:32,161
Oh, come on,
it was her favorite.

1218
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:35,331
Oh, wow, Kirby.
You got some classics here.

1219
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,875
- Yup.
- "Suspiria," "Don't Look Now."

1220
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,502
You know it.

1221
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:41,963
I could trivia your ass under the table,
Cinema Boy.

1222
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:44,882
Oh, yeah?
Who played Leatherface first?

1223
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:49,554
- Gunnar Hansen.
- Wow. Did you feel that?

1224
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:52,390
That charge that moved between us
just then?

1225
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:55,518
Oh, that was me.
I have powers.

1226
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:57,186
So sexy.

1227
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:00,606
You guys are unbelievable.
You're playing fuckin' trivia games?

1228
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:03,318
The cops are gonna come for us. They're
gonna shut down my website.

1229
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:05,153
- We're so dead!
- Yeah. I agree.

1230
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:08,281
- Jesus Christ, where'd you come from?
- The front door.

1231
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:10,408
By the way, Kirby, with everything
that's going on right now,

1232
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:13,536
you probably shouldn't
leave that unlocked.

1233
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,413
Sorry.

1234
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:19,000
And, um, may I ask
what the hell you're doing here?

1235
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:21,794
What?
Didn't I find the after-party?

1236
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:24,797
No, you found the anti-party,
and it's invitation only.

1237
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:28,092
Yeah, well, I got an invitation.
From Jill.

1238
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:34,307
- So, what's the story?
- W... What?

1239
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:38,811
You sent me a text message.
"After-party at Kirby's house."

1240
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:43,358
- I mean, it was from your phone.
- What do you mean from my phone?

1241
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:46,486
Where is my phone?
I think I left it in your car.

1242
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:51,074
I didn't text him.
(sighs) I didn't text you.

1243
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:53,659
And I'll prove it.

1244
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:56,621
So, Charlie, Robbie.

1245
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:59,749
How's it feel to be an accessories
to a crime, huh?

1246
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:02,251
I mean, really, Dewey's wife?

1247
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:03,461
My life is over.

1248
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:06,506
So which one of you guys sent me
a text message from Jill's phone, huh?

1249
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:08,216
(snorts, coughs)

1250
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,928
We're just supposed to accept
that you're telling the truth?

1251
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:15,098
Isn't your phone missing?

1252
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:17,433
- Got a new one.
- Really.

1253
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:21,020
Oh,
that's incredibly convenient.

1254
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,314
- Dewey, it's Hicks.
- What's up?

1255
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,983
- Kate Roberts is dead.
- Huh?

1256
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,902
And Sidney fled the scene.

1257
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:30,154
What?
What happened to Kate?

1258
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,240
She was stabbed just like the others.

1259
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:35,201
- What about Jill?
- No sign of her at all.

1260
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:37,453
Where the hell
were Hoss and Perkins?

1261
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:40,456
They were found dead
in their car two blocks away.

1262
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:44,001
(sighs) Multiple stab wounds.

1263
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,045
Okay.

1264
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,839
I'm on my way.

1265
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,465
Yes, sir.

1266
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,139
(siren wails)

1267
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:59,267
Wrong number.
(beep)

1268
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,144
- Who was that?
- Oh, nobody.

1269
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:04,313
- Did you pick a movie?
- Yeah. We're gonna go scary.

1270
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,941
- "Saw 4."
- Ugh, I saw that in theaters.

1271
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:09,318
It sucks.
It's not scary, it's gross...

1272
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:10,862
(groans)

1273
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,905
(sighs)

1274
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:34,844
(groans)

1275
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:37,263
Charlie, you want to sit
over here next to me?

1276
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:39,724
(chuckles softly)
All right.

1277
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:44,312
(beep)

1278
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:50,401
All right, get ready for a "Hall Pass"
with Robbie Mercer extra.

1279
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:54,822
Now tonight, there is a good chance
that Charlie Walker,

1280
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:59,577
yes, my Charlie Walker,
may get lucky with a girl.

1281
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:04,582
Now I'm unable to, uh,
divulge my exact location, however,

1282
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:11,422
suffice it to say, Woodsboro High
may be in store for some geek history.

1283
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:15,259
We'll see.

1284
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:18,304
(clears throat)

1285
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:20,806
(distant thud)

1286
01:15:27,064 --> 01:15:28,105
Hello?

1287
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,777
Who's there?

1288
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:39,867
Oh, my God...

1289
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:56,509
- Where are you going?
- To make sure the front door is locked.

1290
01:15:56,593 --> 01:15:58,386
(doorbell rings, both scream)

1291
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:00,888
No. Don't open it...

1292
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:07,103
- (whispering) Hey, Charlie?
- Yeah?

1293
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:11,482
I'm sorry, I know you're into
the movie and all,

1294
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,527
but now would be a really good time
to make a move.

1295
01:16:15,862 --> 01:16:18,406
For... me to make a move?

1296
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:20,366
Mm-hmm.

1297
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:23,369
Couldn't you make a move?

1298
01:16:23,453 --> 01:16:25,621
I just did.

1299
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:29,166
'Cause you're actually pretty cute.

1300
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:35,006
Especially when I'm scared and...
lonely... and drunk.

1301
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:41,387
Hey, guys, did...
did you see Jill come in?

1302
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:43,556
I didn't see her outside.

1303
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,058
Yes, Trevor, she is upstairs.

1304
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:49,770
Thank God you're here to protect her
when you can't even find her.

1305
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,356
There's nobody out here.

1306
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:55,443
(chuckles) Oh, dude,
I love this part of the movie.

1307
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:57,194
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1308
01:16:57,279 --> 01:17:01,616
Just when you think they're all safe
and comfortable in the house...

1309
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,784
Ghostface comes in,
and, bam!

1310
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,458
Did I just interrupt something
right here?

1311
01:17:10,542 --> 01:17:14,629
Shut the fuck up.
(chuckles)

1312
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,881
Who invited you, Trevor?!

1313
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:20,426
(chuckling) All right.
Clearly not you.

1314
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:24,221
Wow. I'm gonna be upstairs.
(exhales sharply)

1315
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,932
Get out of my house!

1316
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:31,479
Yeah, yeah.

1317
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:35,232
Okay, I'm a little drunk,
so don't blame your internet connection.

1318
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:39,070
(chuckles) Let's see
what Charlie's up to, shall we?

1319
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:42,323
Or the saga of Trevor and Jill.

1320
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:44,241
Oh,
the intrigue of Woodsboro High.

1321
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,827
Who needs a killer around
when there's so much drama?

1322
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:02,635
(chuckles) Oh, man.

1323
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:06,889
That's better.

1324
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:12,061
(gasps) Aah!

1325
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,275
Agh!

1326
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:24,073
Wait, no, you can't!
You can't! There's rules!

1327
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:26,158
I... I'm gay! I'm gay!

1328
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:29,161
I mean, if it helps.

1329
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:31,414
(grunts)

1330
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,837
...random girl who gets a call

1331
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:39,422
that undoubtedly ends up
getting her killed.

1332
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,757
It's all so predictable.
There's no element of surprise.

1333
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:43,300
You can see ev...

1334
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:58,691
Kirby!

1335
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:01,026
I found my phone.
It was up in your room.

1336
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:03,112
There was no text message
sent to Trevor.

1337
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:07,616
He is such a liar.
Where is he?

1338
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,953
What do you mean where is he?
He just went upstairs looking for you.

1339
01:19:11,037 --> 01:19:13,956
He's not upstairs.

1340
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,332
Trevor?

1341
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:20,463
Charlie? Robbie?

1342
01:19:20,547 --> 01:19:22,757
Maybe they're outside.

1343
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,049
- (screams)
- Jill.

1344
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:26,260
Sidney, I... I'm sorry, I should've told
you and Mom where I was going...

1345
01:19:26,344 --> 01:19:28,596
No, it's okay. It's just,
I... I need you to come with me,

1346
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,890
- Come with me right now, okay?
- (gasps)

1347
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:33,142
Run.

1348
01:19:33,226 --> 01:19:34,935
Robbie!

1349
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:38,189
(screaming)

1350
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:39,482
Go!

1351
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:45,070
- Sidney!
- (grunts)

1352
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:46,363
Come on!

1353
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:52,328
- The balcony!
- There's no other way out?

1354
01:19:52,412 --> 01:19:54,955
We can jump.
(thudding, wood cracking)

1355
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,500
It's two stories.
Where's your cell?

1356
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:58,834
- Uh, here.
- Get under the bed!

1357
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:00,753
- What?
- Just do what I say! Get under the bed.

1358
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:02,630
Don't make a sound and don't come out
until I come get you, okay?

1359
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:04,840
- Just trust me.
- Okay.

1360
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:14,850
You got it? You're okay?
Jill, run!

1361
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,936
Just keep running, get help!

1362
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:30,032
(telephone dialing)

1363
01:20:30,116 --> 01:20:33,285
(telephone ringing)

1364
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:35,037
(grunts)

1365
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:43,295
- (click) Hello?
- Dewey!

1366
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,589
- Sidney, where are you?
- I'm at Kirby's.

1367
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:47,174
The killer is here.
I need your help.

1368
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,176
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.

1369
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,512
(grunts)

1370
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:53,681
Sidney? Sidney!

1371
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:56,517
I need all units to 329
Whispering Lane.

1372
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:58,978
All units,
329 Whispering Lane!

1373
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:09,363
(sirens wailing)

1374
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,124
Sorry. It's just me.

1375
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,626
Look, I tried to call 911,
but the landline's dead,

1376
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:25,296
...and someone smashed the router
- I think I got through on my cell.

1377
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,506
Where's Jill?
(footsteps overhead)

1378
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:30,718
Oh, God.
Go, go, go, go.

1379
01:21:30,802 --> 01:21:33,637
(lock clicks)

1380
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:36,515
There's a room down here.
We can lock ourselves in.

1381
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,893
I heard you yelling to Jill.
Did she get away?

1382
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,519
I think she's safe.

1383
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:46,150
(lock clicks)

1384
01:21:46,234 --> 01:21:47,902
(thudding)

1385
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:51,447
- Kirby, let me in!
- Charlie.

1386
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:54,450
No.
No, no, no, no.

1387
01:21:54,534 --> 01:21:56,493
I just found Robbie.
This... this is his blood.

1388
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,246
Please. Please.
There is someone else out here.

1389
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:00,414
Let me in!

1390
01:22:00,498 --> 01:22:02,458
If you can't trust him,
don't open the door.

1391
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:05,628
My God, let me in!

1392
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:07,046
Get away from the door,
Charlie.

1393
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:09,173
Kirby, it is me.
Please let me in!

1394
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:11,342
Get away from the door,
Charlie.

1395
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,719
It's me!

1396
01:22:13,803 --> 01:22:16,555
(voice breaking) I'm sorry,
I can't.

1397
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,975
- What the fuck?!
- (whispers) I'm sorry.

1398
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,852
Behind you! Look out!

1399
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,228
(grunts)

1400
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:25,314
(gasps)

1401
01:22:25,398 --> 01:22:27,066
No! No, no, no!

1402
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,902
(blows landing) Kirby!

1403
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:36,867
(sirens wailing)

1404
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,623
Oh, God, no, please.
(pounds on door)

1405
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:45,876
Leave him alone!

1406
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,295
(cell phone ringing)

1407
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,382
It's Charlie's phone.

1408
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:54,969
(Ghostface) Tell Sidney heads
are gonna roll tonight.

1409
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:56,804
Tell Sidney
it's all because of her.

1410
01:22:56,888 --> 01:23:01,558
Or maybe she wants to take his place.
I promise to be quick.

1411
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,852
- It's him.
- Okay, okay. I'm gonna get Jill.

1412
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:06,146
We should be in the same place.
Just... just keep him on the phone.

1413
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:09,566
I'll be right back, okay?

1414
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:11,986
Let him go, please.

1415
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:14,363
I hear you like horror movies,
Kirby.

1416
01:23:14,447 --> 01:23:17,032
But do you like 'em
as much as him?

1417
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:20,202
Forget watching "Stab."
You get to live it.

1418
01:23:20,286 --> 01:23:23,747
No, no, no, no, no!
He's the expert! It's not me!

1419
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,083
Warm-up question:
Jason's weapon?

1420
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,335
Uh, it's a machete.

1421
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:31,588
There, you see?
You do know the genre.

1422
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:34,633
- Michael Myers?
- Uh, butcher knife.

1423
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:37,511
- Leatherface?
- A chainsaw. Please!

1424
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:38,804
Just ask Sidney
if you need some help.

1425
01:23:38,888 --> 01:23:41,390
- Freddy Krueger?!
- Uh, uh, razor hands.

1426
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:43,934
Name the movie that started
the slasher craze.

1427
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:46,854
"Halloween," "Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"
"Last House on the Left," or "Psycho"?

1428
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:49,523
- "Psycho"!
- None of the above!

1429
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:51,942
"Peeping Tom," 1960,
directed by Michael Powell.

1430
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:55,154
First movie to ever put the audience
in the killer's POV.

1431
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:57,406
What? Wait.
No, no, no.

1432
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:00,242
Please, just ask me one more question!
Just one more!

1433
01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:02,619
All right, Kirby.

1434
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:06,040
Then it's time
for your last-chance question.

1435
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:11,003
Name the remake of the groundbreaking
horror movie in which the villain...

1436
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:13,756
Uh, "Halloween," uh, "Texas Chainsaw,"
"Dawn Of The Dead,"

1437
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,258
"The Hills Have Eyes,"
"Amityville Horror,"

1438
01:24:16,342 --> 01:24:18,761
uh, "Last House On The Left,"
"Friday The Thirteenth,"

1439
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:21,180
"A Nightmare On Elm Street,"
"My Bloody Valentine,"

1440
01:24:21,264 --> 01:24:24,308
"When A Stranger Calls,"
"Prom Night," "Black Christmas,"

1441
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:28,645
"House Of Wax," "The Fog,"
uh, "Piranha."

1442
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:31,607
It's one of those, right?
Right?

1443
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,449
(exhales) I got it right.

1444
01:24:40,533 --> 01:24:42,409
I was fucking right.

1445
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:43,911
(whispers) Jill?

1446
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:58,342
I won, Charlie.
I fucking won.

1447
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:01,553
I won. He tried to beat me,
but I fucking won.

1448
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:03,597
Great, Kirby.

1449
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:07,726
Hold on.
Okay. Almost there.

1450
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:10,771
Just hang tight.
Okay. Okay.

1451
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:12,314
- All right.
- Kirby?

1452
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:14,108
- Yeah?
- This is making a move.

1453
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:17,611
(gasps)

1454
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:20,405
Four years of classes together,
and you notice me now?

1455
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:22,699
Stupid bitch!

1456
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:25,077
- It's too late!
- (grunting)

1457
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:26,745
Shh. Shh.

1458
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:28,956
Oh, I know, I know.

1459
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,916
It's okay.
Take your time.

1460
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,335
Doesn't happen as fast
as it does in the movies, I know.

1461
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:36,797
C... Charlie... (gasping)

1462
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:38,715
Charlie...

1463
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,385
(grunting)

1464
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:58,026
(door opens)

1465
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:04,491
Kirby?

1466
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:11,373
You know, you learn a lot when
you watch movies over and over.

1467
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:14,209
All the plots
are about trying to kill you.

1468
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:15,961
Where's Jill?

1469
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:18,255
Oh, you think
she's gonna get away?

1470
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:19,715
You think anyone gets away?

1471
01:26:19,799 --> 01:26:21,800
(both grunt)

1472
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:23,719
(grunts)

1473
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:24,928
(gasps)

1474
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:33,103
- Jill?
- Hello, Sidney.

1475
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,271
Surprised?

1476
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:36,481
Watch this.

1477
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:43,071
This is the part, my dear cousin,
when the cameras turn off.

1478
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:46,200
(grunts)

1479
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:47,910
Charlie?

1480
01:26:47,994 --> 01:26:49,578
Already taken care of.

1481
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:52,331
Man, I got great footage
of my Robbie kill.

1482
01:26:52,415 --> 01:26:54,625
Better than Jenny
and Marnie or Olivia even.

1483
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:57,711
Good, we'll cut and upload it later
and make it all traceable to Trevor.

1484
01:26:57,795 --> 01:26:59,421
Speaking of which...

1485
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:05,219
- Remind you of anything?
- Jill, please...

1486
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:07,054
Shut up! Dick.

1487
01:27:07,138 --> 01:27:08,680
Everything I learned,
I learned from you.

1488
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:11,308
You think you had a shitty boyfriend,
Sidney?

1489
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:17,064
Here's one that fucks you, dumps you,
and doesn't even make you famous.

1490
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:20,108
Agh! What the fuck, Jill?
I loved you!

1491
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:22,569
Shut the fuck up already!

1492
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:24,738
Agh! Aagh!

1493
01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:27,282
I'm sure those cops
would want you to have this, Jill.

1494
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:28,742
For your protection.

1495
01:27:28,826 --> 01:27:30,452
No.

1496
01:27:30,536 --> 01:27:35,123
Baby, please...
baby, please...

1497
01:27:35,208 --> 01:27:37,501
Shouldn't have killed
all these people, Trev.

1498
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:39,878
Gone and put it on video even.

1499
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,047
But it means
a lot that you did it for me.

1500
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:44,258
What the fuck
are you talking about?!

1501
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:48,011
I am not the girl you cheat on.

1502
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:52,432
Aagh! Aaaagh!

1503
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:54,977
I've gone through everything.
We're definitely good on timeline.

1504
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:57,729
Oh, yeah.
We're perfect.

1505
01:27:57,814 --> 01:28:00,232
No, no, no, please!

1506
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:03,777
- (gasps)
- You should keep quiet.

1507
01:28:06,739 --> 01:28:08,865
Ready for act three?

1508
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:11,410
Got it figured out yet, Sidney?

1509
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:12,953
In keeping with our remake theme,

1510
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:15,664
Trevor's this generation's
Billy Loomis,

1511
01:28:15,748 --> 01:28:19,001
and we're the innocent victims,
Sidney and Randy.

1512
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:22,671
See, with you, the world
just heard about what happened.

1513
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:25,716
- But with us, they're gonna see it.
- (screaming on video)

1514
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:29,678
It's gonna be a worldwide sensation.
I mean, people gotta see this shit.

1515
01:28:29,762 --> 01:28:33,015
It's not like anyone reads anymore.

1516
01:28:33,099 --> 01:28:39,479
We're gonna know fame
like you never even dreamed of.

1517
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:41,857
Last two teenagers standing.

1518
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:44,568
This time Randy gets the girl.

1519
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:52,909
You were amazing.
You're the perfect victim.

1520
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:56,580
I was so believable today,
wasn't I?

1521
01:28:56,664 --> 01:29:01,168
I mean, I told so many lies
that I actually started to believe them.

1522
01:29:01,252 --> 01:29:03,462
I really think
that I was born for this.

1523
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:05,255
How could you do this?

1524
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:10,427
Do you know what it was like
growing up in this family?

1525
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,846
Related to you?

1526
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:15,766
I mean, all I ever heard
was Sidney this

1527
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:19,102
and Sidney that
and Sidney, Sidney, Sidney.

1528
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:22,647
You were always
just so fucking special!

1529
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:24,483
Well,
now I'm the special one.

1530
01:29:24,567 --> 01:29:26,818
You'll slip.
They always do.

1531
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:29,154
Hm. Come on, Charlie,
let's get on with this.

1532
01:29:32,283 --> 01:29:36,620
You have to be strong.
And hold still, okay?

1533
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:40,082
Yeah. Yeah, old school,
like Billy and Stu.

1534
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:42,292
Come on, baby, get it up!

1535
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:45,921
Come on. Shoulder me!
Shoulder me! Shoulder me!

1536
01:29:46,005 --> 01:29:47,839
Get it up! (grunts)

1537
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:54,805
The heart...
That's not the way we rehearsed it.

1538
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:58,517
You said it, Charlie.
Billy and Stu, Trevor and you.

1539
01:29:58,601 --> 01:30:04,147
What the media really loves, baby,
is a sole survivor.

1540
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:06,400
Just ask you-know-who.

1541
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:11,196
Trevor was your partner.
But you, you were the idea man.

1542
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,781
(gasps)

1543
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:22,958
Even your friends.

1544
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:25,710
My friends?

1545
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:27,754
What world are you living in?

1546
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,589
I don't need friends.

1547
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,967
I need fans.

1548
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:33,468
Don't you get it?!

1549
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:37,180
This has never been
about killing you.

1550
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:40,308
It's about...
becoming you.

1551
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:43,103
I mean, for fuck's sake,
my own mother had to die...

1552
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:47,065
no great loss there...
so I could stay true to the original.

1553
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:49,067
That's sick, right?

1554
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:52,446
Well, sick is the new sane.

1555
01:30:52,530 --> 01:30:54,197
You had your fifteen minutes.

1556
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:56,032
Now I want mine!

1557
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:59,619
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Go to college?

1558
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:02,205
Grad school? Work?

1559
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,748
Look around.

1560
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:06,042
We all live in public now,
we're all on the Internet.

1561
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:09,379
How do you think people
become famous anymore?

1562
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:13,341
You don't have to achieve anything.

1563
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:16,595
You just gotta have
fucked-up shit happen to you.

1564
01:31:16,679 --> 01:31:19,639
So, you do have to die, Sid.

1565
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:23,768
Those are the rules.
New movie, new franchise.

1566
01:31:23,853 --> 01:31:26,521
There's only room for one lead,
and let's face it,

1567
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:29,608
your ingnue days,
they're over.

1568
01:31:29,692 --> 01:31:32,194
(gasps)

1569
01:31:35,948 --> 01:31:37,949
Don't tell me you didn't know
this day would come.

1570
01:32:34,173 --> 01:32:36,049
(ripping)

1571
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:37,759
Aah!

1572
01:32:54,944 --> 01:32:56,987
(screams)

1573
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:58,154
(gasps)

1574
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,532
Oh, fuck!

1575
01:33:17,883 --> 01:33:20,677
(grunting)

1576
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:47,412
(groans)

1577
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:58,673
(sirens approaching)

1578
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:23,490
Come on, let's move it!

1579
01:34:23,574 --> 01:34:25,992
(car doors closing)

1580
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:31,539
He's gone.

1581
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:34,542
Check the rooms,
both sides and upstairs.

1582
01:34:34,627 --> 01:34:35,710
Yes, ma'am.

1583
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:55,271
Jill, can you give us
a description of the murderer?

1584
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:57,440
(reporters shouting questions)

1585
01:35:09,286 --> 01:35:11,705
Jill!
How does it feel to be a hero?

1586
01:35:19,255 --> 01:35:23,007
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1587
01:35:23,092 --> 01:35:27,470
Jill. You made it.
That's all that matters.

1588
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:29,973
Trevor, Charlie,
they tried to kill me.

1589
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:34,686
And I heard they killed my mom.
And... and Robbie and Kirby, too.

1590
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:37,439
Shh. Just lay back.

1591
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:40,316
Try to rest.

1592
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,068
Is... is your wife...

1593
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:43,945
(chuckles softly)

1594
01:35:44,029 --> 01:35:47,824
She's gonna be fine.
She's recovering.

1595
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:52,036
If I ever write a book one day, I'd...
I'd want her to write it with me.

1596
01:35:52,121 --> 01:35:56,750
We'd be a good team
with our matching wounds and all.

1597
01:35:58,377 --> 01:36:02,255
We're survivors now.

1598
01:36:02,339 --> 01:36:05,049
(voice breaking)
I just wish Sidney was, too.

1599
01:36:05,134 --> 01:36:07,302
Jill...

1600
01:36:07,386 --> 01:36:09,429
they're not sure yet.

1601
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:11,973
It's still touch and go.

1602
01:36:12,057 --> 01:36:13,683
But she's in ICU.

1603
01:36:13,768 --> 01:36:17,854
And they think Sidney
just might make it.

1604
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:19,814
What?

1605
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:22,150
But... but I saw Trevor kill her.

1606
01:36:22,234 --> 01:36:24,903
Look, we don't know yet.

1607
01:36:24,987 --> 01:36:26,738
But she's hanging on.

1608
01:36:29,992 --> 01:36:32,118
I... I... I wanna see her.

1609
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:34,954
She's not awake yet.

1610
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:37,582
And she may not
remember anything.

1611
01:36:37,666 --> 01:36:40,043
You'll to help her with that.

1612
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:43,505
All in time.
Just get some rest now, okay?

1613
01:36:45,216 --> 01:36:46,758
(over PA) Your attention, please.

1614
01:36:46,842 --> 01:36:50,428
There will be a mandatory meeting
for all non-emergency personnel

1615
01:36:50,513 --> 01:36:53,598
in the basement conference room
in five minutes.

1616
01:37:08,614 --> 01:37:12,909
There will be a mandatory meeting
for all non-emergency personnel

1617
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:16,079
in the basement conference room
in five minutes.

1618
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:35,098
She gonna be okay?

1619
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:37,851
Yeah.
She's a strong kid.

1620
01:37:37,935 --> 01:37:40,603
She's gonna have to be.

1621
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:43,690
(chuckles)
She asked if you were okay.

1622
01:37:43,774 --> 01:37:48,528
She thinks you guys should write a book
together with your matching wounds.

1623
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:50,488
Why,
she was stabbed in the shoulder?

1624
01:37:54,493 --> 01:37:56,536
How did she know I was, too?

1625
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:03,459
Damn it!

1626
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:11,426
You just won't die, will ya?

1627
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:14,053
- (gasps)
- Who are you?

1628
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:16,014
Michael fucking Myers?

1629
01:38:17,516 --> 01:38:19,517
Yeah, I don't think so.

1630
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:26,357
Fucking die already! (grunts)

1631
01:38:28,694 --> 01:38:31,946
Aagh! Aah!

1632
01:38:32,031 --> 01:38:34,324
(both grunting)

1633
01:38:36,952 --> 01:38:38,328
(screams)

1634
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:51,007
How are those stitches?

1635
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:52,800
Aagh!

1636
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:57,096
(Dewey) Sidney!

1637
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:03,895
Hicks, get up to Sidney Prescott's room
and call for back-up!

1638
01:39:03,979 --> 01:39:05,480
Be right up, sir!

1639
01:39:12,821 --> 01:39:14,447
Sid!

1640
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,575
- Sid...
- Dewey!

1641
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:19,577
(grunting)

1642
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:38,054
Is this how it's gonna be,
Sid?

1643
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:40,223
The ending of the movie
was supposed to be at the house.

1644
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:42,600
I mean, this is just silly.

1645
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:45,770
Consider this an alternate ending.

1646
01:39:45,854 --> 01:39:48,189
You're never
gonna get out of this, Jill.

1647
01:39:48,273 --> 01:39:50,066
- Of course I will.
- Dewey!

1648
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:53,027
(gasps) Sid?

1649
01:39:53,112 --> 01:39:56,572
Easy. Okay, okay.

1650
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:57,991
What about the book?

1651
01:39:58,075 --> 01:40:00,368
Looks like
I'll just have to write it myself.

1652
01:40:00,452 --> 01:40:02,620
Yah!

1653
01:40:02,705 --> 01:40:04,122
- God damn it!
- Ohh!

1654
01:40:04,206 --> 01:40:08,501
Don't even think about shooting
or I'll blow Dewey's head off.

1655
01:40:08,585 --> 01:40:11,838
You think I won't do it?
Gimme your gun!

1656
01:40:11,922 --> 01:40:14,215
Do it.

1657
01:40:14,299 --> 01:40:16,175
You heard her.

1658
01:40:24,059 --> 01:40:26,894
You just had to be the hero, huh?

1659
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:28,646
Gimme your gun.

1660
01:40:28,731 --> 01:40:30,440
(Gale whispers) Give it to her.

1661
01:40:30,524 --> 01:40:33,151
What are you, deaf?

1662
01:40:33,235 --> 01:40:35,862
Give me... your gun!

1663
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:46,622
Now get up.

1664
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:48,416
And keep your hands
over your head.

1665
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:49,751
Don't do anything stu...

1666
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:51,210
(grunts)

1667
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:54,255
Don't fucking tell me what to do.

1668
01:40:54,339 --> 01:40:56,382
(softly) Oh, God.

1669
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:58,009
Now get up, bitch.

1670
01:40:58,093 --> 01:41:00,595
Okay.

1671
01:41:00,679 --> 01:41:02,138
Get up!

1672
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:05,016
- Now!
- Okay.

1673
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:09,187
She's not gonna help you.
Come on.

1674
01:41:09,271 --> 01:41:12,106
(Dewey groans)
Neither is he.

1675
01:41:12,191 --> 01:41:15,276
- Dewey?
- (grunts)

1676
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,529
Let's go.
Get your skinny ass out here.

1677
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:21,699
Okay.

1678
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:25,870
I'm gonna enjoy
blowing your head off.

1679
01:41:25,954 --> 01:41:29,957
Okay, but can I just...

1680
01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:32,210
have one final word?

1681
01:41:32,294 --> 01:41:36,422
What? "Please"?

1682
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:39,967
No.

1683
01:41:40,052 --> 01:41:42,428
- Clear.
- "Clear"?

1684
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:43,888
Clear.

1685
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:51,521
You forgot
the first rule of remakes, Jill.

1686
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:54,107
Don't fuck with the original.

1687
01:41:57,444 --> 01:42:00,113
Oh, my God, Dewey.

1688
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:01,989
(groans) What hit me?

1689
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:05,451
Don't ask. (groans)

1690
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:07,203
You okay?

1691
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:13,209
She was standing
right behind me.

1692
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:16,671
They always are.

1693
01:42:19,049 --> 01:42:20,716
(gasps)

1694
01:42:28,684 --> 01:42:29,809
Oh, God.

1695
01:42:29,893 --> 01:42:32,687
Nice one.

1696
01:42:32,771 --> 01:42:35,982
Hicks? You're alive?

1697
01:42:38,068 --> 01:42:40,778
Wear the vest,
save your chest.

1698
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:47,160
We got two officers down.
Several injuries.

1699
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:50,621
- And a new suspect.
- Sheriff? Sheriff...

1700
01:42:50,706 --> 01:42:54,458
We need a doctor, goddamn it!

1701
01:42:54,543 --> 01:42:57,253
I don't know about you,
but I feel a whole lot better.

1702
01:42:57,337 --> 01:43:00,506
Where the hell is everybody?!

1703
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:03,009
We're live at Woodsboro Community
Hospital,

1704
01:43:03,093 --> 01:43:06,888
awaiting a first public statement
from Jill Roberts, survivor.

1705
01:43:06,972 --> 01:43:11,434
...a survivor of what is now being
called the Woodsboro Massacre Re-boot.

1706
01:43:11,518 --> 01:43:14,896
Jill Roberts is her name,
a name the whole world will now know.

1707
01:43:14,980 --> 01:43:17,231
...who single-handedly put a stop

1708
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:20,151
to this 21st-Century
Woodsboro killing spree.

1709
01:43:20,235 --> 01:43:22,195
Jill Roberts of Woodsboro,

1710
01:43:22,279 --> 01:43:25,364
a girl who's lifted
all our spirits tonight,

1711
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:28,910
an American hero,
right out of the movies.

1712
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:34,790
("Bad Karma" plays)

1713
01:43:43,634 --> 01:43:45,968
You better believe in karma

1714
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:48,512
Baby, it's gonna sting

1715
01:43:48,597 --> 01:43:51,224
The wheel of life's gonna
do you in

1716
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:54,185
So I don't really have to

1717
01:43:54,269 --> 01:43:56,604
You made me drink the Kool-Aid

1718
01:43:56,688 --> 01:43:59,232
You tricked me into thinkin'
that Jill means Jack

You are the firstborn of the Devil

This land is covered with faces
