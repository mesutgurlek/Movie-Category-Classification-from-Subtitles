{445}{616}THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT
{704}{767}In October of 1994,|three student filmmakers. . .
{771}{851}. . .disappeared in the woods near|Burkittsville, Maryland, . . .
{855}{898}. . .while shooting a documentary.
{906}{963}A year later|their footage was found.
{1098}{1151}-It's already recording. . .|-Okay.
{1181}{1201}This is my home. . .
{1205}{1274}-You look blurry. I'll zoom out.|-Okay.
{1293}{1317}Good morning.
{1322}{1361}-Got it?|-Okay, I got it.
{1367}{1399}This is my home, . . .
{1444}{1485}. . .which I am leaving for the weekend. . .
{1490}{1554}. . .to investigate the Blair Witch.
{1581}{1632}Essential reading: "How to Stay|Alive in the Woods", . . .
{1637}{1676}. . .'cause you never know what's|gonna happen.
{1681}{1720}And this is an important book. . .
{1726}{1804}. . . because it has the article about what|happened at Coffin Rock.
{1810}{1826}It looks pretty old. . .
{1830}{1885}It's totally old.|And this is my field notebook.
{1889}{1952}It's Mr. Punctuality.
{1981}{2030}How are you this morning?
{2040}{2056}Tired.
{2060}{2096}So I got the CP up.
{2101}{2117}Good.
{2147}{2208}That's what we're shooting on.
{2213}{2268}No one knows I took it,|but I got it.
{2274}{2333}Come into the house. Come on.
{2371}{2405}I can see you.
{2437}{2498}We're not gonna bump into shit,|I'm going backwards now.
{2504}{2549}We mustn't fuck up the cameras.
{2553}{2596}So where's Mikey?
{2600}{2643}-We have to go get him.|-Okay.
{2648}{2670}At 8:30.
{2675}{2695}Okay.
{2699}{2766}We're already behind schedule, but|it's important to have juice.
{2770}{2790}That's cool.
{2794}{2833}I guess you're Mike!
{2870}{2921}Wait. Stop.
{3012}{3067}Don't we get to meet your Mama?
{3169}{3210}See you later, Mom !
{3234}{3275}How are you, Mike?
{3279}{3307}I'm tired but I'm fine.
{3312}{3371}I'm real excited about this.|Thank you for the opportunity.
{3376}{3440}I'm very glad. Thanks for|getting the equipment together.
{3446}{3497}We've got enough|battery power to. . .
{3501}{3560}. .fuel a small country for a month.
{3566}{3646}We've got rice, fruit punch. . .
{3666}{3703}Oatmeal Raisin, baby.
{3711}{3756}The ultimate campfood.
{3808}{3846}Feel how soft.
{3926}{4000}-Marshmallows. . .|-Hey, you weasel. Out of my cart!
{4130}{4167}Do you believe in ghosts?
{4175}{4224}Ever heard of the Blair Witch?
{4287}{4384}Sounds familiar.|My sister went to Blair High School.
{4394}{4492}The woods around Halloween|are creepy.
{4496}{4580}-Can you tell me a little more?|-I don't wanna go cheesy.
{4585}{4656}I want to present|this straightforward.
{4660}{4713}The legend is unsettling.
{4720}{4756}Wanna get the. . .
{4781}{4834}. . .ceremonial first slate?
{4858}{4895}Absolutely.
{4943}{5023}The first slate for our|first shot.
{5044}{5126}Should we get our fingers open|and bleed on it?
{5136}{5170}A little blood-letting?
{5175}{5208}No, we'll save that for later.
{5213}{5256}Kiss the slate.
{5286}{5324}It's the first slate.
{5328}{5373}Marked by my lipstick.
{5377}{5440}Mikey, kiss it, good luck.
{5446}{5493}-There we go.|-Oh, he licked it. Bless him.
{5498}{5543}Don't eat it. We're gonna need it.
{5559}{5635}This is Burkittsville,|formerly Blair.
{5647}{5718}A small quiet Maryland town.
{5731}{5792}Like a small, quiet town anywhere.
{5797}{5906}Some 20 families laid roots here|over 200 years ago.
{5923}{5994}Many remain, either on this hill. . .
{6005}{6050}. . .or in the town below.
{6081}{6165}An unusually high number of|children are buried here. . .
{6175}{6230}. . . most of whom passed|in the 1 940's.
{6249}{6349}Yet no one here recalls anything|unusual about this time, . . .
{6357}{6400}. . . not to us, anyway.
{6408}{6455}Yet legend tells|A different story, . . .
{6461}{6516}. . .whose evidence is all around us.
{6533}{6572}Etched in stone.
{6735}{6821}We have shot the first scene,|the cemetery scene.
{6825}{6870}The opening is shot.
{6879}{6965}We're doing a documentary|about the Blair Witch.
{6990}{7084}-Have you heard of the Witch?|-That's an old, old story.
{7091}{7117}As I remember, . . .
{7122}{7196}. . . Mr. Parr was an old hermit, . . .
{7215}{7297}. . .and he lived up on a mountain.|He'd been there, . . .
{7301}{7334}. . . for a long, long, time.
{7338}{7391}-You heard of the Blair Witch?|-Several times.
{7397}{7450}What was the first incident?
{7454}{7542}I've heard stories about it|from people and neighbors,
{7547}{7623}I also saw a documentary on the|television. . .
{7629}{7707}. . .about her and legends|of Maryland, . . .
{7711}{7799}. . . my grandmother told us the story|to make us go to bed early.
{7803}{7885}They say if you stay up after dark|or walk around the house. . .
{7889}{7926}. . .the Blair witch will get you.
{7931}{8034}In the fall or winter of 1 940, . . .
{8039}{8113}. . .some young kids|started disappearing.
{8120}{8159}Nobody knew. . .
{8176}{8229}. . .why they were disappearing.
{8285}{8359}-A kind of an omen, isn't it?|-The creepiest story about her. . .
{8375}{8430}. . .was that two men out hunting. . .
{8433}{8521}. . .camped near the cabin|she's supposed to haunt. . .
{8527}{8543}No. No.
{8546}{8601}. . .and they just disappeared|forever.
{8619}{8691}I'm just telling a scary story,|but it's not true.
{8696}{8716}It's not true.
{8720}{8800}One day, old Mr. Parr|came into the market. . .
{8806}{8859}. . .and said "l'm finally finished".
{8863}{8887}And what did he mean by that?
{8892}{8931}Nobody knew at first. . .
{8936}{8983}But the police finally. . .
{8987}{9025}went up the mountain. . .
{9043}{9144}. . .and found the bodies of seven|kids in his house.
{9155}{9235}He would take the kids down|to the basement in twos. . .
{9239}{9294}. . .and he'd make one|face the corner. . .
{9318}{9361}. . .and he'd kill the other one. . .
{9373}{9447}. . .then he'd kill the one in|the corner too.
{9458}{9494}Those were the seven kids|that were missing
{9498}{9570}They brought the kids out of|the woods one at a time. . .
{9574}{9652}. . .it was terrible, it upset|the whole community.
{9657}{9702}He said he couldn't take|the eyes watching him. . .
{9708}{9800}. . .that's why he made them|face the corner like that.
{9804}{9849}All my life I've believed. . .
{9853}{9918}. . .in witches and ghosts and|that kind of stuff
{9921}{9966}Do you believe there are some|in this area?
{9971}{9987}Oh, definitely.
{9992}{10039}-Do you believe in witchcraft?|-No.
{10062}{10115}-Are you religious?|-Yep.
{10120}{10142}Alrighty.
{10146}{10246}Creepy stuff, but I think|something's happening with her.
{10250}{10307}And do you think she could|still be up there now?
{10313}{10354}-I don't go up there.|-You don't?
{10358}{10391}I believe enough not to go.
{10394}{10476}They say the woods are haunted|and stuff like that.
{10482}{10523}What? How are they haunted?
{10526}{10626}Well there's not many people|who say that it's haunted. . .
{10630}{10687}. . . but there was this old woman,|Mary Brown, who. . .
{10692}{10716}Mary Brown?
{10720}{10771}Yeah, and she was kind of crazy.
{10776}{10821}How was she seen by the community?
{10827}{10841}Crazy.
{10849}{10943}There's the American flag,|it's Mary's house.
{10961}{10987}I'm gonna bring her out.
{10992}{11043}You look for the best light, okay?
{11048}{11062}Okay.
{11130}{11191}This is Mary's gate.
{11224}{11281}I'm not even sure how to open it.
{11309}{11379}And something interesting|happened to you once. . .
{11383}{11434}You met the Blair witch?
{11455}{11473}Yes.
{11477}{11507}That is really. . .
{11515}{11572}. . . kind of a scary story.
{11596}{11628}To make ends meet. . .
{11632}{11671}. . . my Dad and I
{11677}{11730}. . . used to fish at Tappy's Creek.
{11738}{11807}In Burkittsville.
{11822}{11889}I was laying on the leaves. . .
{11906}{11978}. . .watching my pole, and|looking at the sky. . .
{11988}{12085}. . .and suddenly I felt|something near me. . .
{12097}{12140}. . . an eerie feeling. . .
{12158}{12205}. . . It was a woman. . .
{12219}{12274}. . .only on her|arms and hands. . .
{12278}{12323}. . .and everything. . .
{12328}{12365}. . .she had hair . . .
{12382}{12439}. . .dark, almost black hair. . .
{12455}{12491}. . .Iike a horse. . .
{12497}{12554}. . .Iike a fur, horse fur.
{12561}{12591}Then on her arm. . .
{12601}{12642}. . .she had a shawl. . .
{12661}{12710}And she scared you,|or threatened you?
{12730}{12812}She didn't say anything,|she just stared. . .
{12817}{12862}. . .and then she opened her shawl. . .
{12870}{12905}What was under there?
{12909}{12981}She had hair on her|body like a horse.
{12986}{13016}Hairy from head to toe?
{13021}{13078}Yeah. And her legs. . .
{13086}{13158}-How about her face?|-You could see she was a female.
{13175}{13232}She was just strange looking.
{13250}{13309}Thank God she's|not in the film business.
{13314}{13390}She thinks she is.|She also says she's a ballerina.
{13397}{13421}Get out.
{13426}{13469}And she says she's a historian. . .
{13473}{13493}I heard that.
{13497}{13552}. . .and that she's a scientist|at the Department of Energy.
{13557}{13633}I fucked up on Mary|with the depth of field.
{13638}{13704}You measured it in meters?|We're not in Europe.
{13718}{13767}The fucking lens|has meters on it.
{13773}{13830}It also has our system.
{13853}{13914}Nah, it has meters. Look.
{13964}{14009}But it's an American camera.
{14014}{14046}All those are meters.
{14055}{14094}What about the brown ones?
{14098}{14124}They're feet.
{14128}{14171}The brown ones are on there, right?
{14176}{14239}Yeah, but the white|ones are obvious.
{14242}{14334}-Didn't you use this camera before?|-Yeah. Once before.
{14343}{14386}How was today, guys?
{14417}{14456}I learned a lot, man.
{14460}{14503}About Mary Brown?
{14512}{14571}No, I learned a lot about. . .
{14589}{14615}1 6 mill?
{14625}{14686}. . .about shooting, just|shooting documentaries.
{14715}{14760}-We kicked some ass today.|-Cheers.
{14769}{14797}Very good day.
{14802}{14818}Excellent day.
{14823}{14853}Very good first day.
{14858}{14942}Let's do an equipment check,|after I call my mom.
{14947}{15021}-I got a bag of Utz and a beer.|-We don't need that on film.
{15029}{15072}So I guess you're covered then.
{15077}{15163}Could you run it a little|to check it's okay?
{15176}{15196}Sure.
{15205}{15293}I just want to check it's loaded|properly so we can shoot. . .
{15325}{15390}Okay, that's good, that's good.
{15397}{15446}That's good, thank you.
{15465}{15524}Let's relax, because we've got|a long day tomorrow.
{15530}{15583}Today's been easy.
{15588}{15651}We're gonna have to do a lot|of hiking, carry a lot of weight.
{15656}{15690}We're preparing.
{15694}{15772}Shut up, smartass.|Pour me a shot, please.
{15778}{15864}-I'm freaking out.|-You can't, you're the director.
{15869}{15961}I fucking have to do this now,|okay? Do we have any weed?
{15992}{16020}Here I go.
{16039}{16080}Drink! Drink!
{16148}{16195}I hate fucking scotch.
{16360}{16386}There's my friend Josh.
{16403}{16427}How are you?
{16431}{16453}I'm hurtin'.
{16458}{16503}I'm not ready for that thing yet.
{16511}{16548}I know you don't like it.
{16584}{16654}Hello. Welcome to day two.
{16661}{16714}The trail is along here.
{16720}{16779}It should be pretty obvious.
{16815}{16860}You guys heard of|the Blair witch?
{16867}{16933}I heard the myth. I don't|really believe much in it.
{16940}{16960}The myth?
{16963}{17004}That's all I think it is.
{17009}{17035}What'd you say, sir?
{17039}{17096}-I said damn fool kids never learn.|-Shut up.
{17103}{17138}Damn fool kids never learn?
{17142}{17160}That's what I said.
{17164}{17196}Why do you say that?
{17201}{17256}First of all, can I|have your permission. . .
{17261}{17327}. . .to use your image on a|video documentary?
{17337}{17384}I don't care about that, but. . .
{17391}{17432}You have to say yes or no, sir,
{17436}{17469}-Watch it.|-I'm sorry.
{17473}{17491}Yeah, sure, okay.
{17506}{17584}Some girl, in the late 1 800's. . .
{17596}{17651}. . . Robin Weaver, I|believe her name was, . . .
{17659}{17751}. . .supposedly wandered|off into the woods.
{17760}{17831}No "supposedly" about it.|She wandered off!
{17841}{17882}-Okay, wandered off.|-And got lost.
{17887}{17913}She got lost.
{17936}{17966}Wasn't no "supposedly".
{17986}{18020}Three days later. . .
{18025}{18103}. . .she appears back on her|grandmother's porch.
{18130}{18195}And everybody's mystified.
{18212}{18265}-She was babbling something. . .|-Her story.
{18270}{18323}Babbling something about. . .
{18329}{18390}. . .an old woman whose feet|never touched the ground.
{18435}{18523}I saw. . just by that|tree up the creek. . .
{18548}{18583}. . . about a hundred yards,
{18596}{18690}I saw a white misty thing.|Can't tell you what it was.
{18695}{18771}Like grey vapor rising|out of the trees.
{18776}{18810}Right out of the water.
{18815}{18837}Right out of the water?
{18842}{18899}Up the side of the trees,|Then it disappeared.
{18905}{18939}You're full of it.
{18943}{18994}I'm not. And I wasn't|drinking that day, either.
{19001}{19019}Sure you weren't.
{19024}{19071}How is that related to the|story of Coffin Rock?
{19076}{19137}It all ties in to the|story of Coffin Rock.
{19141}{19157}How's that?
{19191}{19265}Anybody round here. . .
{19270}{19342}. . . knows that the old woman has|haunted this area for years.
{19348}{19381}That's bullshit.
{19448}{19495}These woods are thick.
{19510}{19540}You excited?
{19565}{19587}You got it.
{19603}{19675}I hope he's not shooting a|whole shitload of stock.
{20220}{20263}I could help, but I'd|rather record.
{20268}{20286}Okay.
{20293}{20359}Packs on, we're ready to go.
{20363}{20408}We gotta go up to the shack?
{20413}{20431}Yeah.
{20594}{20653}My God, this is a very heavy pack.
{20738}{20785}Off to Coffin Rock.
{20789}{20836}I know exactly where we are now.
{20861}{20889}Mikey, give me the video camera.
{20894}{20947}I wanna get her going across, man.
{21039}{21086}I see a dirty behind.
{21186}{21210}Good jump.
{21216}{21230}Thank you.
{21232}{21275}There it is. See?
{21329}{21357}That's Coffin Rock.
{21469}{21526}"They went into the woods|ready to find death. . .
{21530}{21579}. . . but what they found|was inhumane. . .
{21584}{21653}. . .at the site called Coffin Rock.
{21663}{21720}. . . up on the rock, the torture. . .
{21735}{21805}. . .suffered by these five|brave men was obvious. . .
{21809}{21905}. . .they were tied up, one man's|hands tied to the next man's feet. . .
{21910}{21957}. . .forming a solid|human structure. . .
{21961}{22032}. . . blood indicated that|it had happened. . .
{22036}{22102}. . .while they were|alive and resisting. . .
{22108}{22190}. . .their intestines had been|crudely torn out. . .
{22198}{22292}. . .and on each of their faces there|was indecipherable writing. . .
{22296}{22347}. . .cut into their flesh|with precision. . .
{22354}{22418}. . .the men, shocked by|what had happened. . .
{22423}{22466}. . .went to find the sheriff. . .
{22471}{22551}. . .without sketching the writing|or touching the bodies . . .
{22555}{22604}. . .they returned to see|vultures at the rock.
{22609}{22703}But the bodies had been|removed by persons unknown. . .
{22708}{22779}. . .the stench of death|was still thick. . .
{22784}{22866}. . . but the bodies had been|taken in a matter of hours. . ."
{22896}{22978}That happened here|at Coffin Rock.
{23026}{23110}Let's rush, because I want|to camp, and it's 4:52.
{23115}{23185}It's late. We're gonna be|losing light soon.
{23222}{23302}But I can use the shot|without me in it. . .
{23311}{23407}. . . because I recorded sound|while reading the whole thing, . . .
{23420}{23473}. . . so I'm sure I can edit|it together somehow.
{23581}{23611}It's starting to rain.
{23628}{23652}Did you rent this thing?
{23658}{23746}Yeah. I don't have a|tent for three people.
{23758}{23784}Just wondering. . .
{23790}{23839}I don't usually travel with two men.
{23849}{23935}It is pouring with rain.|Can't even light a fire.
{23945}{23994}Show us what the stick is for.
{24037}{24115}Look. We've got our|very own leaning post.
{24127}{24195}If it smells of farts|too much in the night. . .
{24204}{24259}Okay, so I can't have a|cigarette in the tent, . . .
{24268}{24317}. . . but he can fart as|much as he wants?
{24322}{24410}No, I never gave Mike|a fart allowance.
{24430}{24468}You heard noises last night?
{24471}{24532}-I did.|-Problem is, I sleep like a log.
{24538}{24595}There were two separate noises. . .
{24601}{24670}. . .coming from two|areas over here. . .
{24690}{24735}. . .one of them could|have been an owl. . .
{24740}{24793}. . . but the other was a cackling.
{24825}{24851}No way.
{24856}{24894}It was a cackling, man.
{24900}{24957}If I heard a cackling,|I would've shit myself.
{24972}{25015}Where did we start yesterday?
{25022}{25058}Off the map.
{25076}{25168}I knew where we were going.|There was some confusion, but today. .
{25173}{25205}Wait, . . . say that again.
{25210}{25263}I said I knew where|we were going.
{25269}{25340}Wait, . . .was that a|full of shit statement?
{25344}{25360}No, it wasn't.
{25365}{25412}-So that wasn't bullshit?|-I knew where we were going.
{25416}{25469}You got us lost, man.
{25473}{25518}For a very short period of time.
{25531}{25570}Just don't get us lost today.
{25574}{25590}Yeah, seriously.
{25595}{25638}No. These places are|very well documented.
{25643}{25692}You happy with the documentary?
{25698}{25720}Yes, I am.
{25744}{25813}I'm very pleasantly surprised|by our little Mikey.
{25818}{25844}"Our Little Mikey?"
{25852}{25882}Our Little Mikey. . .
{25963}{26001}. . .a very spirited young man.
{26013}{26078}What do you think about the|witch? You think she exists?
{26087}{26126}I don't know.
{26190}{26245}Heather, I really hope|you find us a trail.
{26253}{26321}There's a trail up on|this hill. Don't worry.
{26378}{26423}We like shortcuts, don't we?
{26479}{26530}We like level shortcuts.
{26550}{26595}Not mountain shortcuts.
{26603}{26662}It's the first time we've|seen Mike's chest.
{26666}{26721}It's really hard to film on video.
{26733}{26794}He has really sporadic hair|patterns on his chest.
{26798}{26820}Like symbols.
{26824}{26885}It's like blank. . . hairy. .
{26894}{26935}. . . blank. . . hairy.
{26940}{26962}You should see my ass.
{26968}{27011}Look, here's fucking Uruguay.
{27050}{27091}-And there's Paraguay.|-Yeah.
{27098}{27131}I think I see Bolivia.
{27136}{27226}What killed this|mouse? Witchcraft?
{27283}{27315}How 'bout God?
{27344}{27383}Is that the Blair Witch?
{27393}{27498}No. I think it's Heather,|taking a piss.
{27525}{27599}You know, I|really have to go.
{27630}{27664}Ohhh. . . go!
{27691}{27775}We're near the cemetery|trail. It should only be . . .
{27782}{27825}-What?|-Says who?
{27830}{27854}Says me, of course.
{27882}{27968}We should be there|in about ninety minutes.
{28024}{28054}You guys cool with that?
{28074}{28090}What?
{28094}{28120}Ninety minutes?
{28127}{28188}-If you know where we're going.|-Sure.
{28195}{28240}Josh wants to look at the map now.
{28245}{28290}Though I know|where we're going.
{28295}{28350}If you'd known where|we were, we wouldn't be . . .
{28355}{28381}We're in the middle|of the fucking woods.
{28384}{28447}-How could you possibly know?|-Because some is offtrail.
{28451}{28515}What, somebody told you|there's a cemetery back there?
{28520}{28579}If we're lost, admit that, because. . .
{28585}{28613}. . . I know we're not lost.
{28618}{28673}You knew that yesterday, too,|and twice again today.
{28677}{28749}Bullshit! We have|not been lost today.
{28768}{28801}Not once.
{28808}{28830}Okay, this is where we were.
{28835}{28896}You said that it was|two miles away.
{28900}{28947}Then it's two hours away,|three hours away. . .
{28952}{29013}-Okay, just chill!|-Maybe it's four hours away.
{29017}{29085}-You agreed to do this project.|-I agreed to a scouted-out project.
{29089}{29157}-Not to wander round the woods.|-I told you that . . .
{29162}{29219}. . .getting to the locations|wasn't gonna be easy.
{29225}{29268}Mike, Mike. . .Okay, guys!
{29272}{29325}Please, you're being a smart-ass.
{29330}{29360}We're looking at the map. . .
{29365}{29426}. . .we'll find this the best we can.
{29432}{29522}This is where we were. We're|going more or less this way.
{29541}{29605}Okay, what do you say? Where|do you think we're going?
{29622}{29652}To tell you the truth. . .
{29754}{29822}. . .this is Greek|to me. It's useless.
{29826}{29846}Exactly.
{29852}{29889}So I'm putting my trust in you. . .
{29893}{29964}. . .that you know where it is.
{29984}{30006}Good.
{30036}{30097}Though I gotta tell you,|I don't fully trust you. . .
{30124}{30148}. . .and l. . .
{30165}{30189}What?
{30196}{30265}I don't know why you tape|every conversation, man.
{30269}{30295}Well, we're making a documentary.
{30301}{30375}Not about us getting lost,|it's about a witch !
{30408}{30441}I have a camera.
{30456}{30550}We'll all look back on this|and laugh, believe me.
{30563}{30610}Baby steps, man, baby steps.
{30615}{30693}Just breathe and don't look down.|No, you gotta look down.
{30697}{30731}Are you gonna have to crawl?
{30735}{30749}I'm gonna crawl.
{30753}{30767}Cool.
{30771}{30857}Think how cool the fucking|cemetery is gonna be.
{30909}{30976}Think of the joy of being|in a really good film.
{30981}{31001}Okay, shut the fuck up.
{31005}{31035}Okay, I'm quiet.
{31039}{31067}Shit. How am I gonna do this?
{31072}{31123}Okay. . . Mikey?
{31128}{31142}Yeah.
{31149}{31237}Dude, don't come across|with the DAT on your belly.
{31244}{31264}No way, man.
{31269}{31299}There's no chance.
{31310}{31353}How do we get it|across?
{31357}{31379}It's really fucking hard.
{31383}{31413}How we gonna get|it across?
{31417}{31497}The moss this morning was easy.|This stuff's slippery as shit.
{31519}{31560}Well, how do we get|the DAT across?
{31596}{31670}I don't know. Let|me put my pack down. . .
{31675}{31716}I'll just go back and forth, man.
{31721}{31770}Can you do it that way?
{31776}{31810}It's the only thing I can do.
{31815}{31849}Okay, we'll do it like that.
{31854}{31880}Oh, Christ!
{31885}{31930}Oh, what'd you drop?
{31936}{32026}Nothing.|The tree just broke.
{32031}{32057}Oh, fuck.
{32062}{32111}We're very, very close now.
{32174}{32211}You guys excited?
{32278}{32311}Okay.
{32327}{32360}What's this?
{32540}{32606}What's this? Dude, guys.
{32647}{32708}Remember what Mary|Brown said the other day?
{32750}{32815}What story from the|Bible was she telling us?
{32820}{32875}Fuck, I wasn't listening, I|thought she was crazy.
{32888}{32957}It was Esau, something about a|pile of rocks.
{32974}{33037}She was talking|about her rocks, man.
{33043}{33094}Well, what about|the rocks?
{33129}{33172}Anybody remember?
{33202}{33284}To live your life.
{33316}{33371}Looks like an lndian|burial ground, man.
{33377}{33424}I don't know if this counts,|three. . .
{33474}{33496}. . .four. . .
{33557}{33579}. . .five. . .
{33605}{33629}. . .six. . .
{33664}{33686}. . .seven.
{33692}{33733}Years ago witches|were roasted. . .
{33738}{33787}. . .just like my Vienna sausage.
{33802}{33871}Flames are licking you|like the Devil, Josh.
{33876}{33958}Sit back and hear a tale,|a tale of a fateful trip...
{33965}{34018}...that started on|this desert isle...
{34023}{34068}...aboard this tiny ship...
{34072}{34123}Yeah, but this ship|has a good captain. . .
{34127}{34184}. . . not a beer-guzzling|guy in a blue shirt.
{34192}{34228}He wasn't beer-guzzling.
{34241}{34290}They had no beer on|the island, man.
{34295}{34366}If they had beer, they'd|have had big-ass orgies.
{34400}{34476}You're like the Captain,|and Mike's your Gilligan.
{34488}{34525}-No offense.|-That's all right.
{34532}{34564}It was a compliment. . .
{34602}{34638}. . .Gilligan was a funny guy. . .
{34645}{34696}. . .the Captain was fat, though.
{34700}{34755}Well okay, let's call|it a thin Captain.
{34761}{34797}It's not Captain. . .
{34802}{34861}It's the Skipper.
{34902}{34930}No more Captain.
{34977}{35041}Here we are back at|the rock again. . .
{35045}{35086}. . .the cemetery deal.
{35129}{35180}I just wanna be careful|not to get in the shot.
{35387}{35426}It certainly is odd.
{35582}{35652}Please tell me you didn't|just knock that over.
{35658}{35695}I didn't just knock that over.
{35700}{35797}That's not very nice.|Let me put it back.
{35997}{36038}You can't be too careful.
{36048}{36081}What'd you think?
{36106}{36184}It was the same, only darker.
{36199}{36238}Yeah, pretty much.
{36268}{36329}All right. Bag it up.
{36348}{36372}Hello?
{36409}{36448}Shit, no light.
{36610}{36648}We were sleeping.
{36653}{36675}Do you want this?
{36702}{36747}Put it by the tent door.
{37082}{37110}Listen.
{37149}{37173}Hello?
{37214}{37238}Hello!
{37422}{37508}It's all around us.|Fucking weird.
{37524}{37569}Michael, aren't you|coming down?
{37579}{37605}I ain't going down there.
{37612}{37640}Why not?
{37645}{37686}-Because I don't hear shit.|-You're fucking scared.
{37690}{37718}Because I don't|hear anything!
{37723}{37776}You cannot deny hearing it.
{37801}{37846}Get your ass out! Come on !
{37903}{37952}This rain fucking blows, man.
{37958}{38005}I know. It's raining heavily.
{38020}{38104}Thanks mom for giving me|rain gear for my birthday.
{38110}{38148}God bless her.
{38154}{38201}What do you think it|was last night?
{38234}{38270}Personally?
{38273}{38287}Yeah.
{38291}{38344}Someone fucking|with your head.
{38349}{38392}But nobody knows|we're here.
{38397}{38456}Yeah, but. . .you ever see|"Deliverance"?
{38468}{38552}Well, whatever it was,|I just wanted to. . .
{38556}{38609}You were freaking out.|You bugged me out.
{38614}{38686}I was. I woke up suddenly|and shit's going down. . .
{38690}{38729}. . .and all I can think is|"l want it all. . .
{38734}{38799}I want it on sound,|I want it on sixteen.
{38803}{38869}If we see anything,|I want it on sixteen."
{38880}{38954}Sounded to me like a lot|of people running around. . .
{38959}{39006}. . . maybe they were locals|or whatever.
{39010}{39057}I don't know what|the hell they wanted.
{39062}{39159}We're deep in the woods, and|if people want to mess with us. . .
{39163}{39212}. . .then there's something|wrong with them. . .
{39217}{39251}. . .and I'm not gonna|get into that.
{39255}{39283}And if it wasn't people?
{39288}{39333}Well, I'm not gonna|get into that, either!
{39371}{39395}Fuck, man. .
{39443}{39486}. .it's been a very long day. . .
{39490}{39558}. . .a very wet, very long day.
{39630}{39712}Nobody's speaking to me|right now .
{39726}{39789}Dude, I don't remember|any of this.
{39810}{39838}What?
{39842}{39908}I don't remember any|of this coming from the car.
{39912}{40004}We have to go a different|route to get back. . .
{40010}{40059}. . . because we went|around in a curve.
{40118}{40171}Two more hours max, guys.
{40221}{40315}If we came by a short cut, why|are we going back a different way?
{40358}{40407}Because we have to go round. . .
{40422}{40481}It was the most direct way to|hit our two locations.
{40492}{40533}And this is the quickest|way back to the car.
{40538}{40560}Seriously?
{40565}{40599}Yes. Seriously.
{40603}{40672}-You know exactly what's going on?|-Yes. Let's just keep going.
{40677}{40703}All right.
{40724}{40779}Five minutes and we|do a map check.
{40790}{40816}All right.
{40834}{40926}We just did a map check,|and we're still on track.
{40946}{40982}That's not what I said.
{41002}{41057}We're all right. Come on,|just keep going.
{41143}{41194}Well the compass says. . .
{41200}{41253}. . .we go straight ahead,|that way.
{41270}{41321}We're in the middle of nowhere.
{41330}{41391}We've been in the middle|of nowhere for two days.
{41395}{41436}Just like the car.
{41440}{41504}Look at this shit, man !|This is nothing.
{41539}{41586}Let's just keep|going, all right?
{41658}{41693}I think we should camp.
{41697}{41723}Get the fuck out of here!
{41728}{41777}Why? 'Cause you don't know|where we are?
{41781}{41830}No, because we're still|A little way from the car. . .
{41835}{41867}. . .and it's gonna be dark soon.
{41901}{41981}-Look, I'm not sure. . .|-We don't camp. Stop the camera. . .
{41985}{42011}. . .and get us home.
{42015}{42097}Turn the camera off and give|me the fucking map.
{42103}{42137}Turn it off and get us home.
{42141}{42217}No, I'm filming. I want|to mark this occasion.
{42222}{42246}Give me the map.
{42251}{42321}The map is in my|pocket. Wait a second.
{42325}{42355}God damn !
{42366}{42446}If we keep our heads|together, we'll be just fine.
{42450}{42486}Fucking bullshit!
{42490}{42516}Mike, chill.
{42528}{42558}Just relax, Mike.
{42564}{42613}Don't fucking tell|me to relax!
{42626}{42700}Let's just sit down,|and check the map. . .
{42704}{42753}Yes. Let's do that, please.
{42786}{42818}Are you happy?
{42822}{42855}I'm not happy, no.
{42874}{42946}But the car isn't far. But we|can't find it in the dark.
{42951}{43017}Are you absolutely sure?
{43022}{43114}Yes. I'm so sorry. We can still|get the DAT back tomorrow.
{43117}{43147}We have to. . .
{43152}{43232}We will get the|DAT back on time.
{43237}{43271}And the camera.
{43275}{43310}We'll get it all|back tomorrow.
{43314}{43371}I start work tomorrow at nine.
{43376}{43400}I know.
{43404}{43453}It's fine. Let's go to sleep.
{43457}{43508}Let's just fucking camp, okay?
{43519}{43570}I wanna tape it from|inside the tent.
{43709}{43780}Whatever it is, it sounds the|same as last night.
{43958}{44026}Where's my boots? Fuck, it's cold. . .
{44145}{44167}Hello?
{44263}{44331}Shit, it's fucking freezing. . .
{44360}{44384}. . .there.
{44413}{44435}What?
{44440}{44466}I hear it.
{44481}{44515}I don't hear shit.
{44541}{44574}You hear that?
{44724}{44746}Shit. . .
{44995}{45021}Hello?
{45736}{45789}I think it's just a deer.
{45814}{45875}-Could be deer, I guess.|-It's just a deer.
{45881}{45918}I don't think so, man.
{45921}{45997}Sounds just like last night.|It's all around us.
{46002}{46032}It's gotta be just a deer.
{46037}{46070}It was a deer, man.
{46095}{46132}It wasn't like last night.
{46282}{46304}You say something?
{46308}{46394}Yes! Fucking listen ! Let's|get it on DAT. . . be quiet. . .
{46399}{46433}Okay, it's on.
{46523}{46589}Jesus Christ! What the|fuck was that?
{46758}{46807}It's not scared by our yelling.
{46928}{46969}Sounds like footsteps.
{46974}{47023}I know! It's a fucking person !
{47063}{47139}I don't see shit on video.|We'll just use DAT, right?
{47144}{47164}But I'm staying out.
{47168}{47201}You stay out here with me.
{47205}{47231}I am. I am.
{47239}{47333}What time is it? Anywhere|near morning?
{47356}{47372}Let me see. . .
{47377}{47438}Tell me it's five|O'clock or something.
{47474}{47492}Three.
{47496}{47516}Fuck!
{47552}{47628}Bullshit. This is|fucking crazy.
{47673}{47734}I'm sorry, Mike. We should|be home already.
{47739}{47788}This has got nothing to do. . .
{47814}{47857}. . .with what we're here for.
{47862}{47907}This is just it's bullshit.
{47930}{48001}Woke up this morning,|two seconds ago. . .
{48017}{48081}. . .and there are piles of|rocks outside our tent.
{48173}{48216}There are three, actually.
{48256}{48327}Are you positive those|weren't there last night?
{48332}{48401}I am fucking positive|they weren't here!
{48407}{48464}How could we have|just camped. . .
{48468}{48548}. . . between three piles of rocks|just by coincidence?
{48567}{48606}You don't think this is strange?
{48620}{48704}It is fucking weird, but|I really don't care. . .
{48709}{48770}. . . because all I want to do|is get to the goddam car.
{48775}{48849}Whatever it is,|man, right now. . .
{48858}{48901}. . .we have to get back to the car.
{48906}{48975}They obviously don't want us|Here, so let's get out.
