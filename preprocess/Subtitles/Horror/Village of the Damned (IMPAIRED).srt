The children did it.
I know they did it.

01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,932
And my daughter
was involved.

648
01:01:10,934 --> 01:01:13,268
Now, who are they?

649
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:16,204
I'd originally thought
they were some form of mutation,

650
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:19,941
some abrupt
evolutionary jump.

651
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:22,044
It was their
communal consciousness,

652
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:24,846
but I couldn't explain
the blackout...

653
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,948
Or the mass pregnancies.

654
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:31,153
Midwich isn't the only colony
of such children.

655
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:38,427
In a township in
northern australia, 30 infants
were born in a single day.

656
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:41,029
They all died within
ten hours of birth.

657
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,098
In an inuit community
outside of anchorage,

658
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,233
a group of ten children
were born.

659
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:49,137
There were 20 births
in a small village near
the turkish-iranian border.

660
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:53,341
Each location was remote,
isolated,

661
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:56,411
and each had a blackout
the same as midwich.

662
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:58,880
And how long have you
known about this?

663
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:01,183
The way I see it,
there's three possibilities.

664
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:03,385
Number ONE: Parthenogenesis,

665
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:07,089
the development
of a fetus
without fertilization.

666
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:11,226
I know. I don't
buy that, either.

667
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:15,130
Number TWO: We do know
the C.IA. Slipped
large doses of lsd to men...

668
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:20,135
Without them knowing it
in order to study the effects of
psychotropes on gene structure.

669
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:22,104
So maybe the government
engineered the blackout,

670
01:02:22,106 --> 01:02:25,140
then artificially
inseminated your women
with super sperm.

671
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:27,342
First they knocked 'em out,
then they knocked 'em up.

672
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,348
And what's
the third possibility?

673
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:37,219
Xenogenesis. Implantation.

674
01:02:37,221 --> 01:02:40,288
The production of an offspring
unlike that of the parent.
