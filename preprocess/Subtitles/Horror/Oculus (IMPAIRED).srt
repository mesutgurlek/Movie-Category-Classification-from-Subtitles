is a gorgeous antique mirror,
recovered from the Levesque Estate.

The Lasser Glass is a

It spent several seasons adorning

save for a small hairline fracture

necessarily large,

- We'll take you off the network.
- OK.

168
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,999
Because I guess there were
some complaints about people

169
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,519
printing out their sales reports
and finding some really...

00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,799
I noticed you put in a transfer
order for the Lasser Glass.

- Yeah, as a repair.
- Oh.

just waiting for an explanation

been strange at times.

is Kaylie Ann Russell.

266
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,359
I'm 23 years old.

267
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,799
I'm with my brother,
Timothy Alan Russell.

268
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,639
Alan, of course, after his father.

He's...

He's 21 years old.

271
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,399
It's 4:15pm on October 13th,

and we are at 2705 Hawthorne Way.

273
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,559
I'll begin by detailing my precautions
before I place and uncover the glass.

274
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,279
There are three cameras, each on
its own independent power circuit,

275
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,079
so if any anomalies occur, there
can be a lucid, objective record.

276
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,119
I have private land lines for today's
experiment, along with my cell phone.

277
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,759
And I will now ask my
brother for his phone,

278
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,143
so that I can control
all electronic devices.

279
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,671
I just got this, you know.

280
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,191
Thanks, Timbo.

281
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,559
This alarm is set to go
off every 45 minutes

282
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,799
to remind me to change the
tapes in the cameras.

283
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,479
This alarm is set to go off
hourly to remind us to eat.

284
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,479
And we're fully stocked on
water to prevent dehydration.

285
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,159
Now, as for the house itself...

286
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,719
each room is fitted with
its own thermostat,

287
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,319
from which data is collected by
software designed to track and record

288
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,959
temperature fluctuations
in hospitals.

289
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,759
Any temperature changes greater than
five degrees in either direction

290
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,839
will set off an alarm.

291
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,639
A third precaution
is also in place,

292
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,919
but I'll get into that
in a few more minutes.

293
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,199
So...

294
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,199
The purpose of today's experiment

295
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,639
is to prove that the object
behind me, the Lasser Glass,

296
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,999
is home to an observable,
predictable supernatural force.

297
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,559
There's no scientific equivalent
for the word "haunted,"

298
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,399
so we'll just say this object is
responsible for at least 45 deaths

299
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,719
in the four centuries of
its recorded existence...

300
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,959
Can I just stop you for a second?

301
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,183
Don't ever turn off a camera.

302
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,266
Sorry.

303
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,319
The origin of the Lasser
Glass is unknown,

304
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,439
so I can't provide a
complete history,

305

but the trail starts
in London in 1754.

307
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,359

it over his fireplace, and...

- (CELL PHONE RINGING)

Hi, sweetie. How are you?

310
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,079
Well, I'm checking in,

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,199
- You all right?
- Everything's fine.

312
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,919
I know this is silly to ask, but
could you try to call on the hour?

I told him I'm nervous to be
spending time with my recently

318
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,199
un-incarcerated brother,
with instructions...

319
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,519
- to notify the authorities immediately
- Wow.

320
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,999
if I do not answer the phone.

321
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,839
- In the room.
- Nothing personal.

322
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,759
So, in 1755, Philip Lasser was
found in their grand fireplace.

323
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,719
Burned beyond recognition.
While his estate was dismantled

324
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,439
and scattered throughout
southern England,

325
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,999
one of the family's stewards claimed
to see Philip reflected in the mirror.

326
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,279
An allegation apparently taken
seriously enough to warrant

327
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,319
a Church investigation
into the house.

328
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,439
The glass, thereafter known
as the Lasser Glass,

329
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,119
is sold in public auction in 1758.

330
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,239
The next known owner is an
American rail road tycoon,

331
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,759
named Robert Clancy, 1864.

332
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,239
Clancy apparently weighed
over 300 pounds.

333
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,519
In fact, while attending
university in Connecticut,

334
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,239
he was known as the
South Windham Whale.

335
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,079
He hung the glass in his
ballroom in Atlanta.

336
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,599
Later that year, Robert
Clancy is photographed

337
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,759
by a local newspaper and, uh...

338
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,199
Well, he's dropped a few pounds.

339
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,439
His obit was printed a few weeks later.
Doesn't list a cause of death.

340
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,199
Unfortunately, he and his
estate and the glass

341
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,919
are presumably destroyed in Sherman's
march to the ocean in 1865.

342
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,719
And after that, the glass is lost.

343
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,399
Until it resurfaces in
turn-of-the-century New England.

344
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,079
The next case of note
is Mary O'Connor, 1904.

345
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,799
She hung the mirror in
her private bathroom.

346
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,279
Two weeks later, her niece Beatrice
finds Mary dead in the bathtub.

347
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,119
Now, the official coroner's report lists
the cause of death as, get this...

348
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,319
dehydration.

349
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,839
The woman died of thirst while soaking
in a full tub for three days.

350
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,399
The next case of note is Alice Carden
in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, 1943.

351
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,519
Neighbors reported hearing screams
and loud bangs from the house.

352
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,559
The police found the children
drowned in a locked cistern.

353
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,159
Alice herself was in the nursery,

354
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,879
and both of her legs are
completely shattered.

355
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,359
Her left arm is broken in four places,
and six of her ribs are crushed.

356
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,039
In her right hand is a large hammer she's
been using to break her own bones.

357
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,759
They find her just as she's
going to work on her skull.

358
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,999
Her right arm, though,
is completely unharmed.

359
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,959
Because she needed it.
To wield the hammer.

360
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,679
Alice later says she believed she was
tucking the children into their beds

361
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,119
as she sealed them
into the cistern.

362
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,479
She never recovers
from her injuries.

363
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,559
And, oh, the family kept
several dogs at the farm,

364
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,639
including an Australian
shepherd for the children.

All the people who stared, pointed.

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,999
The kids at school who
always found out.

371
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,588
I guess I'm talking to everyone
who ever called Dad a murderer.

372
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,309
Called you a murderer.

373
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,519
Look, Kaylie, we were just kids.

374
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,319
We made up a scary story so we
wouldn't have to accept the fact

375
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,639
that our father was
a murderer. He was.

376
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,102
He was a sick man who
tortured and killed our...

377
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,151
You can call me crazy all you like.

But you're not allowed to
talk about him that way.

379
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,479
Tobin Capp, 1955. Starved to
death in his own bedroom.

380
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,559
The mirror was hung over his dresser.
He had a pet Dalmatian.

381
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,439
1965, California.

382
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,439
The mirror hangs in the lobby of
the Hill Trust Bank in San Diego.

383

A ten-year teller, Marcia Wicker,
locks her manager in the bank vault

00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,319
and then chews through

- Kaylie...

dies in her bedroom of
hemorrhaging due to a miscarriage.

In her nightstand, they find
every single one of her teeth

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,359
in a little plastic bag and
a pair of bloody pliers.

- There's a huge difference

between causation and correlation.

I know the difference, thank you.

00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,039
OK then. In 2001, Mom and
Dad bought that new couch.

393

Same year, Grandpa had a heart attack,
Robbie Schultz got hit by a car.

394
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,319
And our cat ran away.

395
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,799
How much of that do you
blame on that couch?

396
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,719
Can I get back to this now?

397
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,079
Sure, but let's get to it, Kaylie.

Husband to Marie.

Father to Timothy and Kaylie.

00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,959
Within two weeks of its arrival,

405
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,999
Marie suffers an intense
psychological breakdown

406
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,079
and is tortured and murdered
in the family home.

407
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,870
By whom?

408
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,589
By her husband.

409
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,159
So say the police reports.

410
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,067
And her husband was shot
to death by her own son.

411
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,542
Right in front of her daughter.

412
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,119
I intend to prove that none of
the people I've just described

were responsible for their actions.

414
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,599
Alan Russell was not a
murderer. He was a victim.

415
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,119
One of many, as it turns out.

416

Victims of the supernatural force
that resides in that mirror.

417
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,507
So why don't we just end it right
now and smash the goddamn thing?

Please, smash it, by all means.

Okay.

423

You know, I've learned a lot about what
happens to people when they can't...

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,301
can't process something horrible.

425
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,707
The mind creates all kinds of
protections to help them cope.

426
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,919
And once that belief's taken root,

427
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,225
the mind takes random information and
forces it to support that narrative.

How many thousands of records
did you have to pore through

to find 12 or 13 that
support your case?

Because I'm trying to have
a conversation with you.

432
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,439
Uh-huh. Only one person I
know of was ever documented

433
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,039
trying to break the mirror.
Oliver Jeffries. 1971.

434
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,959
A teacher at Manhattan's
Duhame Academy,

435
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,519
where the mirror hung in
the central lecture hall.

436
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,159
One morning he reportedly ran at
the mirror with a fireplace poker,

437
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,839
shouting about how it
needed to be destroyed,

438
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,279
but he never struck a blow.
According to the students,

439
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,839
he stood there quietly
for almost a minute

440
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,984
before walking out of the
hall and into traffic.

441
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,559
It's clearly capable of
defending itself, and...

00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,147
(WHISPERING)
...I think it just disarmed you.

smash the mirror, Kaylie?

Besides you getting fired or charged
with destruction of property?

445
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,423
It isn't mine to break.

446

No one can break your
delusion for you.

You have to do it yourself.

Which leads me to my
final precaution.

to a mechanical kitchen timer.

No electricity, which is important,
and we're about ten seconds away.

reset every 30 minutes,

from happening again is
our continued survival.

wait for it to come out and play?

460
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,279
Because we've got a
loaded gun to its head.

461
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,390
And I expect it'll be
