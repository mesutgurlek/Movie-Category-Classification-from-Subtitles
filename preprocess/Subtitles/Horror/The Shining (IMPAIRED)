What line of work are you in now?

49
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:37,141
I'm a writer.

50
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:41,013
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

51
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,189
This ought to be
quite a change for you.

52
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,915
Well, I'm looking for a change.

53
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:49,721
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

54
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,522
...I agree with them.

55
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:53,962
Let's see, where were we?

56
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,761
I was about to explain...

57
00:05:57,004 --> 00:06:01,168
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.

58
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,833
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

59
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:07,843
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?

60
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:11,506
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

61
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:14,312
It would be. The problem is
the enormous cost...

62
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:17,081
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

63
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:19,453
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

64
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,025
It gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

65
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,460
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible...

66
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:27,599
...to keep it clear.

67
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,167
When the place was built in 1907...

68
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,930
...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

69
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,009
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

70
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:40,770
It's certainly got plenty of that.

71
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:42,175
That's right.

72
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:45,716
Did they give you any idea in Denver...

73
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,580
...about what the job entails?

74
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:49,881
Only in a very general way.

75
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,123
Well...

76
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:54,960
...the winters can be fantastically cruel.

77
00:06:55,162 --> 00:06:58,620
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

78
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:00,823
...and depreciation
which can occur.

79
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:03,468
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

80
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,629
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

81
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:10,537
...repairing damage as it occurs...

82
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:13,577
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

83
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:16,878
That sounds fine to me.

84
00:07:17,284 --> 00:07:20,253
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

85
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:23,617
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

86
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:26,452
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

87
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:32,156
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

88
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:35,627
I'm outlining a new writing project.

89
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:39,335

is just what I want.

That's very good, Jack.

91

...solitude...

93
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:49,108
...and isolation...

94
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:52,251
...can, of itself, become a problem.

95
00:07:53,053 --> 00:07:54,645
Not for me.

96
00:07:55,188 --> 00:07:58,419

Great.

99
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:08,928
Well, before I turn you over to Bill...

100
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:12,628
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

101

Not to sound melodramatic...

102
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:17,034
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

103
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:19,439
...second thoughts about the job.

104
00:08:20,147 --> 00:08:21,808
I'm intrigued.

105
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,347

said anything in Denver...

106

during the winter of 1970.

109
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,153
My predecessor in this job...

110
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:39,355
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

111
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:43,093
He came up with his wife and
two little girls of about 8 and 10.

112
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:46,295
He had a good employment record,
good references.

113
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:48,770
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

114
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:51,671
...like a completely
normal individual.

115
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:54,244
But at some point during the winter...

116
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:58,076
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

117
00:08:58,285 --> 00:09:00,651
He ran amuck...

118
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:06,252
...and killed his family
with an ax.

119
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:12,157
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

120
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:16,663
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

121
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:19,701
The police thought...

122
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:23,967
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

123

A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur...

it actually happened here.

why I wanted to tell you about it.

...left it for you to tell me.

can be put off...

Now, Tony, tell me.

161
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:11,038
DOCTOR: <i>Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.</i>

162
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,745
That's good. Now the other one.

163
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:20,619
Good boy.

164
00:12:27,961 --> 00:12:29,326
Now, Danny...

165
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:31,821
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

166
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:35,023
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

167
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:40,002
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

168
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:44,002
No.

169
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:47,569
DOCTOR: Do you remember
when you were brushing your teeth?

170
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:49,445
Yes.

171
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,212
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

172
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:02,555
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

173
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:07,494
Now, Danny, can you remember
what you were doing...

174
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,635
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

175
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,902
Talking to Tony.

176
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:17,941
Is Tony one of your animals?

177
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:21,747
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

178
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:24,448
Tony's his imaginary friend.

179
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:26,284
DOCTOR:
Oh.

180
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:30,788
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

181
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:32,991
No.

182
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,688
Why not?

183
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:37,793
Because he hides.

184
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,192
Where does he go?

185
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:43,098
To my stomach.

186
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:48,039
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

187
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:54,773
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

188
00:13:55,582 --> 00:13:57,243
Okay.

189
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:58,850
That's fine.

190
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:01,416
All right, Danny.

191
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:05,020
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

192
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:08,592
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

193
00:14:08,795 --> 00:14:09,921
Do I have to?

194
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:12,393
Yes. I'd like you to.

195
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:15,363
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

196
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:17,934
I'll come back and check on you.

197
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:19,969
-Okay.
-Bye.

198
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:28,612
-Shall we go into the living room?
-Yes.

199
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:34,183
-Please.
-Thank you.

200
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:42,426
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

201
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:46,656
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

202
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:48,834
Yeah?

203
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:50,826
Oh.

204
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:54,498
He seems absolutely fine now.

205
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:55,732
But you should've seen him.

206
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:57,433
I know.

207
00:14:57,644 --> 00:14:59,339
Kids can scare you to death.

208
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:02,413
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

209
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:05,175
And they look much worse
than they are.

210
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:08,380
But what was the matter with him?

211
00:15:08,588 --> 00:15:12,684
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

212
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:17,761
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

213
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:21,534
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

214
00:15:21,734 --> 00:15:24,703
...a kind of self-induced trance.

215
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:26,895
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

216
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:30,868
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

217
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:32,811
No, thank you.

218
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:35,743
I'm sure you're right.

219
00:15:37,383 --> 00:15:40,079
Have you been in Boulder long?

220
00:15:40,887 --> 00:15:42,184
Only about three months.

221
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:45,755
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

222
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,560
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend....

223
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:52,820
Tony.

224
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:56,991
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

225
00:15:58,204 --> 00:15:59,933
No, um....

226
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:01,437
Let's see....

227
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:04,701
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

228
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:07,607
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

229
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:10,312
Did he adjust well to school?

230
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:12,344
No.

231
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:14,452
He didn't like it too much at first.

232
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:17,953
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and....

233
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:23,254
Yeah, I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

234
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:26,663
What sort of injury did he have?

235
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,494
He dislocated his shoulder.

236
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:32,233
How did he manage to do that?

237
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:38,735
It was just one of
those things, you know.

238
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:40,936
Purely an accident.

239
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:44,712
My husband had been drinking...

240
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:48,250
...and he came home
about three hours late.

241
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:53,116
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

242
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,627
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

243
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:03,131
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

244
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:06,396
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

245
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,631
...you know, in a park or in the street.

246
00:17:09,742 --> 00:17:12,370
But on this particular occasion...

247
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:15,206
...my husband just used
too much strength...

248
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:18,009
...and he injured Danny's arm.

249
00:17:21,054 --> 00:17:25,582
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said:

250
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:28,385
"Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

251
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:30,528
And if I do, you can leave me."

252
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,061
And he didn't.

253
00:17:32,265 --> 00:17:36,759
He hasn't had any alcohol in 5 months.

254
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:03,528
Boy.

255
00:18:03,696 --> 00:18:07,860
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

256
00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:10,535
Mm-hm.

257
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:14,734
Dad?

258
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:16,866
Yes?

259
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:19,238
I'm hungry.

260
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,810
You should've eaten your breakfast.

261
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,551
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

262
00:18:27,754 --> 00:18:29,381
Okay, Mom.

263
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:34,953
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

264
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:40,029
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

265
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:41,496
Oh.

266
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,101
What was the Donner party?

267
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:50,304
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

268
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:53,808
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

269
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:58,211
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

270
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:02,253
You mean they ate each other up?

271
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:05,549
They had to in order to survive.

272
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:06,986
Jack.

273
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:08,285
Don't worry, Mom.

274
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:12,828
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on HIGH.

275
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:15,660
See, it's okay.

276
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:18,302
He saw it on the television.

277
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:50,832
-What time does the plane leave?
-8:30.

278
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:53,801
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

279
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:55,940
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Bye.

280
00:19:56,142 --> 00:19:59,270
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

281
00:19:59,478 --> 00:20:02,106
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

282
00:20:02,315 --> 00:20:05,216
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

283
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:07,147
-Hi.
-Is your family having a look around?

284
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:10,720
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

285
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:13,050
-Has your luggage been brought in?
-Right there.

286
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:14,454
Oh, fine.

287
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:16,561
In view of all we have to cover today...

288
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:20,425
...I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

289
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:23,124
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

290
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:25,532
-Fine.
-I'd better collect my family first.

291
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:26,933
Oh, yes.

292
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:36,813
This is our Colorado Lounge.

293
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:39,450
It's beautiful.

294
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:41,717
My God!

295
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:44,481
This place is fantastic, Isn it, hon?

296
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,021
It sure is.

297
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:49,023
I've never seen anything
like this before.

298
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:52,631
Are all these
Indian designs authentic?

299
00:20:52,832 --> 00:20:54,265
I believe they're based...

300
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:57,664
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

301
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,838
They're really gorgeous.

302
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:01,063
As a matter of fact...

303
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:04,368
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

304
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:07,746
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

305
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:11,041
In its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

306
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,219
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

307
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,480
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

308
00:21:17,757 --> 00:21:19,019
Lots of movie stars.

309
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:20,783
Royalty?

310
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,559
All the best people.

311
00:22:15,681 --> 00:22:18,241
This is the staff wing of the hotel.

312
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:22,551
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

313
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:25,689
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Goodbye, girls.

314
00:22:25,925 --> 00:22:27,916
ULLMAN:
And here are your quarters.

315
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:30,921
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

316
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,621
And a small bedroom for your son.

317
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:38,999
Perfect for a child.

318
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:40,866
-Yeah.
-Yes.

319
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:49,937
ULLMAN: Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

320
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:51,707
Easy to keep.

321
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:55,545
Cozy.

322
00:22:55,755 --> 00:22:58,019
ULLMAN:
Yes, very cozy for a family.

323
00:22:58,257 --> 00:22:59,918
If you feel like spreading out...

324
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:02,788
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

325
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,921
Well, it's very...

326
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:08,763
...homey.

327
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:10,127
Yeah.

328
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,934
This is our famous hedge maze.

329
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,440
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

330
00:23:18,644 --> 00:23:20,942
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

331
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:23,775
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

332
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:26,975
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

333
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:30,480
WENDY:
When was the Overlook built?

334
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,720
Construction started in 1907.

335
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:35,894
It was finished in 1909.

336
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:38,757
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

337
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,591
They actually had to repel...

338
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,701
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.

339
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:46,203
That's our Snowcat.

340
00:23:46,906 --> 00:23:48,203
Can you both drive a car?

341
00:23:48,374 --> 00:23:49,363
BOTH:
Yes.

342
00:23:49,542 --> 00:23:53,034
ULLMAN: That's fine. Basically
the Snowcat operates very much like a car.

343
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:55,805
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

344
00:23:57,016 --> 00:24:00,383
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

345
00:24:00,586 --> 00:24:03,111
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

346
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:05,883
Oh. He sure did a beautiful job.

347
00:24:06,092 --> 00:24:08,424
Pink and gold are my favorite colors.

348
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:11,594
Well, this is our Gold Ballroom.

349
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:14,424
Oh, I'll say!

350
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:18,399
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

351
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:21,805
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

352
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:25,807
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

353
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:29,071
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

354
00:24:29,281 --> 00:24:32,341
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

355
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:33,507
We don't drink.

356
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,152
Then you're in luck.

357
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:39,586
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

358
00:24:39,792 --> 00:24:41,919
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

359
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:44,858
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

360
00:24:45,064 --> 00:24:46,258
Glad to meet you.

361
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:49,332
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

362
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:53,266
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

363
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:55,337
It's just wonderful.

364
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,065
Hi, Danny!

365
00:24:58,277 --> 00:25:00,677
I found him outside looking for you.

366
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:04,576
Dan, did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

367
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,978
Yeah.

368
00:25:06,152 --> 00:25:07,278
Come on over here.

369
00:25:07,453 --> 00:25:09,011
-Thanks.
-Thank you, Susie.

370
00:25:09,221 --> 00:25:13,214
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

371
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:15,290
...while I continue on with Jack.

372
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:17,928
It would be a pleasure. Right this way.

373
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,688
Great. See you later, hon.

374
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:21,264
Bye, darling.

375
00:25:23,636 --> 00:25:26,969
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

376
00:25:27,173 --> 00:25:29,698
Now, are you a "Winnie,"
or a "Freddie"?

377
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:30,898
I'm a Wendy.

378
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:34,568
Oh, Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

379
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,407
This is the kitchen, huh?

380
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:38,207
This is it.

381
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:40,885
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

382
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:44,386
Yeah. It's the biggest place I ever seen.

383
00:25:44,623 --> 00:25:46,955
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

384
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,720
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

385
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,495
Don't let it get you down.

386
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:56,190
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

387
00:25:56,402 --> 00:25:58,597
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

388
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:01,034
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

389
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,368
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

390
00:26:04,577 --> 00:26:09,241
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

391
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:12,542
Right here is our walk-in freezer.

392
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:16,746
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

393
00:26:16,956 --> 00:26:18,947
You got 15 rib roasts...

394
00:26:19,158 --> 00:26:21,285
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

395

two dozen of pork roast...

Do you like lamb, Doc?

00:26:31,203 --> 00:26:32,898
-No.
-You don't?

399
00:26:33,072 --> 00:26:34,630
What's your favorite food, then?

400
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,705
French fries and ketchup.

401
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:39,434
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

Come along, now.

Mr. Hallorann...

00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,678
...how'd you know we call him Doc?

405
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:53,915
-Beg your pardon?
-Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

406
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:56,151
-I did?
-Yeah.

407
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:59,456
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

408
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:00,927
But how did you know?

409
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:03,658
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

410
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:06,133
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

411
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:08,533
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

412
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:10,936
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

a little boy...

453
00:29:38,924 --> 00:29:41,449
...my grandmother and l
could hold conversations...

...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

She called it "shining."

it was just the two of us...

I'm not supposed to.

A lot of lines around here
