1
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,790
Take them into the forest now.

2
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,979
You stay here.

3
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,023
I'll be back soon.

4
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,086
- Wait!
- No!

5
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,055
I said, stay here!

6
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,432
Father! Wait!

7
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,190
Help us! Please!

8
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,291
Hello! Is anybody there?

9
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,209
Eat!

10
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,657
Eat!

11
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,091
Eat!

12
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,335
{Screaming}
Eat!

13
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,810
This oven's not hot enough!

14
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:13,901
More wood!

15
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,069
What?

16
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,133
Is it hot enough for you now?

17
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,297
<i>My sister and I
never saw our parents again.</i>

18
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,233
<i>It was just the two of us.</i>

19
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,808
<i>But we learned a couple of things
while trapped in that house.</i>

20
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:25,144
<i>One: Never walk into a house
made of candy.</i>

21
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:31,350
<i>And two: If you're going to kill a witch,</i>

22
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,719
<i>set her ass on fire.</i>

23
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,066
Fresh milk! Fresh milk

24
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:07,373
for the children!
Keep your children healthy! Fresh milk!

25
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,614
After weeks of living in fear,

26
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:16,677
we have finally caught the one
responsible for all this terror!

27
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:17,056
For crimes against
the city and people of Augsburg,

28
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:21,425
For crimes against
the city and people of Augsburg,

29
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:27,856
and for consorting with
the spawn of Satan,

30
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:33,728
I hereby accuse this woman

31
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,510
of the craft of witchery!

32
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,340
Burn her! Burn her!

33
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,546
Behold

34
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,514
the eyes of the demon.

35
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,316
Go to hell.

36
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,032
Order!

37
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,489
Order!

38
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,761
Berringer,

39
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,538
this is still my town.

40
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,678
Listen to me.

41
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,540
As your mayor, I know only too well

42
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:23,088
that many of you
have lost precious loved ones to this

43
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:27,056
witch plague,
but we can't just burn this woman.

44
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,184
We first need evidence.

45
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,455
We can't just have...

46
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,760
You know a witch when you see one!

47
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,927
They ride at night
and they make pacts with the devil!

48
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,532
This woman will burn!

49
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,075
Burn her! Burn her!

50
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,078
Let the girl go
or I'm going to blow your sheriff's brains

51
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:58,281
all over these fucking hillbillies.

52
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,188
Move. Go on.

53
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,728
Let her go. Go over there.

54
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,819
Check her.

55
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,094
What's your name?

56
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,599
What's your name?

57
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,396
- Mina.
- Don't worry.

58
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:18,470
When a woman truly deals in witchcraft,
she cannot hide it.

59
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:23,378
A nasty rot sets in. It shows in her teeth,

60
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,143
in her skin and her eyes.

61
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,345
This is not a witch. This woman's clean.

62
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:34,452
I'm sure your sheriff was only trying
to protect you good people.

63
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,858
But your mayor has done
a very smart thing.

64
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,955
He hired us.

65
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,091
My name is Gretel,

66
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,362
and this is my brother, Hansel.

67
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,799
We know that many of your children
have gone missing.

68
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,274
But killing an innocent woman
will not bring them back.

69
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,436
Go home! We don't want you here!

70
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,013
We don't want more evil in Augsburg!

71
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,242
Well, evil is upon you,
whether you like it or not.

72
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,376
Now if your children are still alive,

73
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:06,013
we will find them.
But if anyone harms this woman,

74
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,289
you're going to have me to deal with.

75
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,260
Now go home!

76
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,194
Go!

77
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,771
I guess you're free to go.

78
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,471
Thank you,

79
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:30,708
Hansel.

80
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,210
You're welcome.

81
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,919
What the hell do you think
you're doing? Huh?

82
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,618
That woman is a suspect in my custody.
You can't just come here...

83
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:45,060
Any man with half a brain
could see that she was not a witch.

84
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,760
Now listen, Sheriff.

85
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,629
Hansel and Gretel
have been brought here...

86
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,725
You better listen!

87
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:55,271
I'm not going to have this bitch
and her scoundrel of a brother

88
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,272
coming into my town,

89
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,204
telling me what to do.

90
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,717
Don't!

91
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,823
Just don't.

92
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,591
Come on. Let's get you started.

93
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,961
<i>There's been reports of
a strange cottage in the north forest.</i>

94
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:29,003
<i>Locals won't go near the place.</i>

95
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,903
<i>A good place to start the investigation.</i>

96
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,417
Move!

97
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,412
Gretel!

98
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,640
She looks angry.

99
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,244
Yeah.

100
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,977
A face like that, I'd be angry, too.

101
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,479
Would you shut up?

102
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,555
<i>That witch we found
was a dead end, Mayor.</i>

103
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,286
<i>No trace of any kids. I'm sorry.</i>

104
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,191
But we found this.

105
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,194
That is called the Blood Moon, Mayor.

106
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,469
An eclipse of the moon.

107
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,630
It happens once in a generation
and is a night most holy to witches.

108
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,703
Oh, my God.

109
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,432
When?

110
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,445
According to this,
three nights from now.

111
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,981
There's no doubt in my mind
that all this is connected.

112
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,051
Children being taken in these numbers

113
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,142
from the roads and fields
so close to town.

114
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,950
A witch does not come out
in the open like that.

115
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,524
Not unless she has to.

116
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,961
Witch activity
has been increasing lately.

117
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:42,033
More sightings,
animal slaughter, Sabbaths.

118
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,629
It seems the coming of the Blood Moon

119
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,934
is dragging every damned witch
from their dark hiding place.

120
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,936
So,

121
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,069
it seems like a good thing

122
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,078
that you brought us here,
doesn't it, Mayor?

123
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:57,610
Half your money now.

124
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,812
The rest when the children
are brought back alive.

125
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,050
Oh, there he is, right on time.

126
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,990
This is Jackson.
He knows these woods inside and out.

127
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,493
And he'll take you to where
the last sightings were.

128
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,064
Yeah. We can be there in a few hours.

129
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:13,399
Not at night. It's too dangerous.

130
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,833
Not at night. It's too dangerous.

131
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,094
We'll leave in the morning.

132
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,136
Yeah, she's right.
It's much too dangerous.

133
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,632
So, any place
we can get a drink in this hellhole?

134
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,207
Shut up!

135
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,376
The last one they took was a boy.

136
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:38,650
Less than two days ago,
so the scent is still fresh.

137
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:45,029
100 shilling for every child
you return alive.

138
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,055
You better be fast

139
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,601
before our mayor's witch hunters

140
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,897
rob this town blind.

141
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:54,697
You leave tonight.

142
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,967
In witch country at night?

143
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,205
You must be out of your mind.

144
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,663
I'm telling you,

145
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,223
we should put the fire out.

146
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,493
We're hunting witches,

147
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:00,303
not bears. And we have to eat.

148
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,257
Such beautiful creatures.

149
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,495
Are they yours?

150
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,797
Yes, ma'am.

151
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,844
Why have you come here?

152
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,447
To the dark of the forest?

153
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,878
A child was taken, ma'am.

154
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,921
We're here to find him
and take him back.

155
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,919
There are no children here.

156
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,729
Here...

157
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,893
There's only death!

158
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,228
Witch!

159
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,265
Fools!

160
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,944
This is my land!

161
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,522
How dare you?

162
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,423
Please?

163
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,628
Please, God... No.

164
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,172
There's no use in praying, my friend.

165
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:48,441
Even your God knows better
than to come here.

166
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:12,132
There have been
abductions here and here,

167
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,499
on both sides of the river.

168
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,633
And on this last one,

169
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:18,006
we believe a troll was involved.

170
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,840
- A troll?
- Trolls are extra.

171
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,413
Another round.

172
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:25,312
It's really unusual. Look at this one.

173
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,441
A father and three children attacked.

174
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,620
One child was taken,
but she didn't touch the other two.

175
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,290
That's weird.

176
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,517
That's so weird.

177
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,423
- It is strange. It is strange, okay!
- Yeah, yeah.

178
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,189
Then again,
we hunt witches for a living.

179
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,389
What's normal, really?

180
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,365
Excuse me. Hansel and Gretel?

181
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,298
Oh, my God, I can't believe you're here.

182
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,234
I'm Ben. Benjamin Walser.

183
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,898
I am really quite a fan of your work.

184
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,031
That's great.

185
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,871
It's nice to meet you, Benjamin.

186
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,604
Listen, if it's not too much trouble,

187
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,407
- would you please sign...
- Oh, no...

188
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,243
Okay.

189
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,816
Oh, my.

190
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,408
Yeah, that's from when you
found the Fox Witch of Antwerp

191
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,612
and sank her in the moat.

192
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,588
And this one's from the
Secret Witch Ring of Belsen.

193
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,489
When they tried to put a gate to
hell under the courthouse.

194
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,255
I mean, you guys, you certainly
taught those witches a thing or two.

195
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,387
Wow.

196
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,398
This is amazing. And weird.

197
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,263
- A little creepy.
- Yeah...

198
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,961
You really keep all this stuff.

199
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,038
All right, well...

200
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,732
I just have so many questions.
Do you mind?

201
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,365
- You know, we have...
- Oh, no, no.

202
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,103
- You go ahead.
- All right.

203
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:30,839
Okay. How do you best kill a witch?

204
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:31,973
Hansel?

205
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,146
Cutting off their heads tends to work.

206
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,482
Ripping out their hearts.

207
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,352
And skinning them is also nice.

208
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,392
Yeah, but burning is the best way.

209
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,393
'Cause that's the only way to be safe.

210
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,055
- Burning, yeah, of course.
- Burn them all.

211
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,860
Is it true that witches can't harm you?

212
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,629
Well, no, that is horseshit, son.

213
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,399
Their magic doesn't work on us.

214
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,099
And they haven't killed us, yet.

215
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,471
Do you think that's because of

216
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,875
the witch that you burned
when you were children?

217
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,344
I guess that's how
it all started for you guys.

218
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,609
I mean, is that how
you became witch hunters?

219
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,809
How did you get your guns?

220
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,146
- How did you get your weapons?
- Okay, okay.

221
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:11,120
There's lots of things to do.
You're a really nice kid,

222
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,316
but we have a town under attack.

223
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,362
She killed them!

224
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:23,833
She killed them all.

225
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,227
Who killed what?

226
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:27,998
The witch!

227
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,031
She killed the trackers. All of them.

228
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,641
She gave me a message.

229
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,144
For you all.

230
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,702
The Curse of Hunger
for Crawling Things.

231
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,132
I fucking hate that one.

232
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,733
That was awesome.

233
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,823
It's working.

234
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,437
It's not even warm.

235
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,513
Muriel, this could change everything.

236
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:19,050
It will change everything.

237
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:23,210
We will be invincible.

238
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:24,788
Take it out.

239
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,690
Take it out! Take it out!

240
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,324
It's of no use if it doesn't last.

241
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,988
I can make it last.

242
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,828
Forever.

243
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,731
Where are we going?

244
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,100
We're almost there.

245
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,843
Hey.

246
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:22,902
Hey.

247
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,579
I just had this really weird dream.

248
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,677
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

249
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:29,879
About what?

250
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,560
I think it was about our mother.

251
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,359
We don't talk about that.

252
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,931
Go to sleep.

253
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,900
What do you think? Boy, girl?

254
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,932
Okay. Here you go. I'll take this.

255
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,976
A little small for you, maybe.

256
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,277
Oh, hello.

257
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,852
No, this, this is...

258
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,017
This is not for me.

259
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:41,150
So, how goes the witch hunting?

260
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,887
It's good. Witch hunting's good.

261
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,159
It's strange being among these people.

262
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,292
Yeah?

263
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,162
If you hadn't come,
they'd have burned me alive.

264
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,037
Yeah, well, I probably
would have let them,

265
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,075
but I'm old-fashioned that way.

266
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:02,213
My sister, however,
requires a little bit more evidence

267
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,678
before someone gets roasted.

268
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:10,081
Have you ever come across a witch
that you didn't want to kill?

269
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,519
No, never.

270
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,324
The only good witch is a dead witch.

271
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,424
Can you hold this?

272
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,600
Are you all right?

273
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,066
Yeah.

274
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,337
When I was a kid,

275
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,548
a witch made me eat
so much candy, I got sick.

276
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,348
Something happened to me.
I have to take this injection

277
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,023
every few hours or else I die.

278
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,287
You have the sugar sickness.

279
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,598
I actually know a thing or two about it
if you ever need any help...

280
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,327
It's all right.

281
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,096
- So...
- I'm fine.

282
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,840
It was good seeing you.

283
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,005
Yeah.

284
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,173
You're very handsome.

285
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,942
And no man in this town
will walk with me.

286
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,849
And you have

287
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:20,613
my pumpkin.

288
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,761
I... I have to go.

289
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:28,858
See you.

290
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,179
It'll all be perfect.

291
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:51,278
Daddy! Daddy, please help me! I'm lost!

292
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,586
Daddy, please!

293
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,892
Please help me! I'm lost!

294
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,431
Daddy, I'm scared!
I'm alone in the woods!

295
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,438
I can help you, little boy.

296
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,466
Sweet little boy.

297
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,237
Please help me!

298
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,081
Daddy! I'm scared!

299
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:20,046
I'm alone in the woods!

300
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,788
<i>Please help...</i>

301
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,492
You move, you die.

302
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,228
Get her wand.

303
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,457
I like your toys.

304
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:22,004
They have brought
a live witch into my office!

305
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:25,870
They need to interrogate her.
That's all there is to it. Now...

306
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,043
Good night, Sheriff.

307
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:42,055
You tell us what we want
and this might not end up

308
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,128
being the most painful night of your life.

309
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,563
- The children.
- Where are they?

310
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,432
They still alive?

311
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,335
These witches, they never learn.

312
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,404
Let's try this again.

313
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:08,414
Where are the children? Why so many?

314
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,576
Where are the children?

315
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:10,822
The blood of the twelve moons

316
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,790
The blood of the twelve moons

317
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,085
will soon be collected.

318
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,191
And after that,

319
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,995
only one object remains.

320
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,430
Why don't you just burn her?

321
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,870
We're wasting our time. She's useless.

322
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:30,566
Twelve moons. Twelve...

323
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,107
Twelve, twelve...

324
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,508
How many children
have been taken so far?

325
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,675
I don't know, ten or eleven.

326
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,578
The files. We need to count them.

327
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,550
- It's eleven.
- Eleven. Twelve moons.

328
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,387
They need one more child.
One more child.

329
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,961
Look,
there's got to be some sort of pattern.

330
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,324
- Look for their age...
- Yeah.

331
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,795
...hair colour, genders, something.

332
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,264
- I've got five girls.
- Six boys.

333
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,093
You need another girl?

334
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,201
"Twelve moons," what does that mean?

335
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,931
It's a month. It's a month.

336
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,908
There's no April. April is missing.
It's April.

337
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,669
They need a girl born in April.

338
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,213
You are too late.

339
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,714
- Go!
- Yes!

340
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,221
Sheriff, birth records of Augsburg.
Do you have them here?

341
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:31,859
It is there.
Strictly for the law of this town, not for

342
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,766
filthy bounty hunters like yourself.

343
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:34,860
Come on.

344
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,134
There can't be that many.

345
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:43,807
- Anything?
- I only got one!

346
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,712
Little girl, six years old, born April 8th.

347
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,442
- She's the only one I could find.
- You go.

348
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:50,545
This girl, do you know her?

349
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,555
Yes, I know her. Mary Behlmer.

350
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,955
Where does she live?
Sheriff, she's in danger!

351
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,094
Fire! Fire!

352
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,331
Time is up. Tell me where she lives.

353
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:25,383
Over here!

354
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,125
Mama!

355
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,232
Stop! Stop right there!

356
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,738
Oh, no! No, no. Oh, no.

357
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,707
No, Lucas! Lucas.

358
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,741
No!

359
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,546
Damn you!

360
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,189
Take her back!

361
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,637
To the well!

362
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,798
Over here!

363
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,838
We need more help!

364
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,220
Now whatever happens,
I want you to stay cool.

365
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:34,022
- Follow my lead. Okay?
- Got it.

366
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,786
Are you a good shot?

367
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,224
No.

368
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,761
Not really.

369
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,227
That's why I use a shotgun.

370
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,505
Gretel,

371
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,708
the famous witch hunter.

372
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,751
Finally we meet.

373
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,312
Who are you?

374
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,956
I see you got my invitation.

375
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,523
Say your name
before my arrows rip out your throat.

376
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,658
I go by many names,

377
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,327
none of which
you're worthy of pronouncing.

378
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,730
Oh, my God.

379
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,457
Help! Help!

380
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,256
Please!

381
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:50,990
Hey!

382
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,582
Help!

383
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,160
Shit.

384
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:44,048
Don't worry. I'm not going to kill you.

385
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:45,916
Not now.

386
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,315
And not like this.

387
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,390
You

388
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,259
have something I need.

389
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,061
The last ingredient.

390
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:26,627
Humans have such ghastly taste.

391
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:39,065
I think this place...

392
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,378
...could use a bit

393
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,848
of colour.

394
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,436
Shit!

395
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,376
- Good morning.
- What are you doing?

396
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:52,040
You were covered in filth, so I was just

397
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:54,077
cleaning.

398
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,621
What happened?

399
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:10,468
Well, the witches took a young girl,

400
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,958
Well, the witches took a young girl,

401
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:14,537
and a lot of people died in the fires.

402
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,200
And now the Sheriff,
he's blaming you and your brother

403
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,502
for what happened last night.

404
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,140
Augsburg's not really
safe for you anymore.

405
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:22,576
And my brother?

406
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,077
Last time I saw him,
he was fighting one of them

407
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,411
on her broom, flying out of town.

408
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,483
Right.

409
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,724
Wow.

410
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,329
Where did you get all this stuff?

411
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,263
From everywhere.

412
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:46,632
I actually plan to be a witch hunter,
too, when I get older.

413
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:47,704
Like you guys.

414
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,402
This isn't the life we chose, Ben.

415
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,506
I was wondering about that story

416
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,676
about your parents leaving you.

417
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,685
Is all that true?

418
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,411
Yep.

419
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:08,517
Why?

420
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,858
I don't know.

421
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,190
That's what they did.

422
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:22,372
I'm sorry. Do you want some porridge?

423
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:24,704
Sure.

424
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:39,049
Not too hot, not too cold, but just right.

425
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:48,962
So last night,

426
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,659
who was she,
the witch who attacked us?

427
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,892
I don't know.

428
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:57,963
She looked normal
at first, but then she changed her face.

429
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,434
- I thought only Grand...
- Grand Witches have that ability, yeah.

430
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,080
Who is this?

431
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,926
She lived outside of town
a long time ago.

432
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:23,761
<i>She was accused of witchcraft,
but she never confessed.</i>

433
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,565
We just burned her anyway.

434
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,329
You're safe.

435
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:30,395
You'll be safe.

436
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,469
I have to find my brother.

437
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,480
Hansel!

438
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:42,576
Hey!

439
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,345
Hansel! Are you all right?

440
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,385
Oh, shit.

441
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,525
The witch hunting is going well, I see.

442
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,157
Yeah.

443
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,368
Hey, say, can you...

444
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:03,099
Can you tell me
which way is back to town?

445
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:05,030
That way.

446
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,103
That way.

447
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,572
Okay.

448
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,107
Thank you!

449
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,148
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

450
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:19,584
- You need some help?
- No, I'm fine.

451
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,584
I'm fine. Thank you.

452
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,956
Okay. I'll see you later.

453
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:26,727
Mother...

454
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,231
Are you okay?

455
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,835
Hi. Help me.

456
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,338
Hansel!

457
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,448
Hansel!

458
00:44:58,262 --> 00:44:59,320
Are you done yet?

459
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,492
I've got to get to my sister.

460
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,027
This may take a while.

461
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,565
But if we don't clean it,
you'll get the fever.

462
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,805
Fever?

463
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,242
You've really taken a beating,
haven't you?

464
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:20,807
I think the real damage
was to my dignity,

465
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,983
which I left somewhere
in that tree back there.

466
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:35,356
It's probably going to be easier
if you just get in.

467
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,793
Oh, no, no. No, I can't.

468
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,467
The water is healing.

469
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,771
Yeah, I don't swim well.

470
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,274
Then I'll go in with you.

471
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:51,173
Oh, okay.

472
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:01,456
Oh, boy.

473
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,701
So, it's healing waters, did you say?

474
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:22,108
You know, the last time
I was in waters like this,

475
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,872
I came across
a formidable Serpent Witch.

476
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,650
She mostly looked like a toad

477
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:29,878
but she could breathe underwater,

478
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,655
which made her difficult to track.

479
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,625
She was deadly.

480
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,625
You talk too much.

481
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,293
Hansel!

482
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,638
Hansel!

483
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:43,786
Come here.

484
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,164
She's a wild one, eh?

485
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,837
What do you think you're doing?

486
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:59,306
You're under arrest
for the burning of Augsburg

487
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:01,740
and for bringing
the witch plague to our streets.

488
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:05,007
Listen, you idiot! The witches are
planning something big!

489
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,242
I need to find my brother
and save your shitty little...

490
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:08,818
Shut up.

491
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,217
This time,

492
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:15,551
I do the talking. You do the bleeding.

493
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,158
Bitch!

494
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:38,841
You're making this too easy.

495
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,746
You want some more? Huh?

496
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:52,754
What

497
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:55,025
the hell?

498
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:03,840
No!

499
00:50:02,188 --> 00:50:03,519
Following this road,
you should be able to

500
00:50:03,656 --> 00:50:05,988
make it back to Augsburg by nightfall.

501
00:50:06,425 --> 00:50:07,551
Yeah.

502
00:50:08,828 --> 00:50:10,125
I hope so.

503
00:50:11,097 --> 00:50:12,860
When you find your sister,

504
00:50:12,965 --> 00:50:14,899
could you come back to see me again?

505
00:50:17,169 --> 00:50:18,966
Yes, of course.

506
00:50:54,173 --> 00:50:55,140
Drink.

507
00:50:56,042 --> 00:50:57,009
No.

508
00:50:59,545 --> 00:51:01,604
Drink!

509
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,218
Why did you save me?

510
00:51:43,022 --> 00:51:44,080
Trolls

511
00:51:44,657 --> 00:51:47,125
serve witches.

512
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,397
Hey, wait.

513
00:51:56,802 --> 00:51:58,565
Wait!

514
00:52:04,043 --> 00:52:05,340
What's your name?

515
00:52:07,813 --> 00:52:09,781
Edward.

516
00:52:13,486 --> 00:52:14,475
Edward, wait!

517
00:52:15,488 --> 00:52:16,819
Where am I?

518
00:53:33,399 --> 00:53:34,696
Hansel?

519
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,892
Gretel?

520
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:36,968
Where have you been?

521
00:53:37,102 --> 00:53:38,296
Where have you been?

522
00:53:46,478 --> 00:53:47,604
- Hi.
- Hi.

523
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:49,043
Hey, what happened to your face?

524
00:53:50,649 --> 00:53:52,139
Gretel?

525
00:53:52,251 --> 00:53:53,309
- Who did this to you?
- I'm okay.

526
00:53:53,419 --> 00:53:54,386
Who did this to you?

527
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,487
I'm okay.

528
00:53:57,590 --> 00:53:59,217
Honey, I'm sorry.

529
00:54:00,426 --> 00:54:01,893
I'm sorry.

530
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:09,063
You okay?

531
00:54:09,602 --> 00:54:10,899
I'm okay.

532
00:54:16,275 --> 00:54:17,572
Where are we?

533
00:54:19,111 --> 00:54:20,305
I don't know.

534
00:54:23,349 --> 00:54:24,373
You okay?

535
00:54:24,483 --> 00:54:26,178
Did you have to land on me?

536
00:54:30,122 --> 00:54:31,749
What is this place?

537
00:54:45,638 --> 00:54:47,731
This isn't a regular witch's lair.

538
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,898
No.

539
00:54:50,709 --> 00:54:53,007
Let's get the hell out of here.

540
00:55:04,423 --> 00:55:05,720
Hey, sis?

541
00:55:08,093 --> 00:55:10,527
I think you're going to
want to come see this.

542
00:55:20,773 --> 00:55:23,241
I think this is our old house.

543
00:55:24,943 --> 00:55:26,740
And this is our old room.

544
00:55:29,114 --> 00:55:30,411
Here. Look.

545
00:55:31,383 --> 00:55:32,680
There's your bed.

546
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:34,677
Right?

547
00:55:39,024 --> 00:55:40,286
Remember this?

548
00:55:46,298 --> 00:55:47,765
I think that's you.

549
00:55:48,467 --> 00:55:51,095
And some sort of vicious badger.

550
00:55:56,975 --> 00:55:58,602
Old beds.

551
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,117
Hansel.

552
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:14,959
You ever wonder
what happened to our parents?

553
00:56:22,134 --> 00:56:24,261
We don't talk about that, Gretel.

554
00:56:24,403 --> 00:56:25,927
We made a promise, you know that.

555
00:56:26,472 --> 00:56:28,599
Why do you think
the witches' spells don't work on us?

556
00:56:28,741 --> 00:56:29,708
Leave it alone.

557
00:56:29,808 --> 00:56:31,366
- This is our house.
- Yeah?

558
00:56:31,477 --> 00:56:32,944
This is where we grew up!

559
00:56:33,045 --> 00:56:34,979
And what does that look like to you?

560
00:56:35,481 --> 00:56:37,881
I don't know, Gretel.
We grew up over a witch's lair.

561
00:56:37,983 --> 00:56:39,007
So what? So we're cursed?

562
00:56:39,118 --> 00:56:41,018
No. I think that our mother was...

563
00:56:43,522 --> 00:56:48,391
I see you finally found your way
home after all these years.

564
00:56:49,094 --> 00:56:50,891
How very sweet.

565
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,008
I remember this house.

566
00:57:04,543 --> 00:57:06,511
The house of Adrianna,

567
00:57:07,379 --> 00:57:09,574
the Great White Witch.

568
00:57:11,717 --> 00:57:14,379
Your whore of a mother.

569
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,024
Let me tell you a little story.

570
00:57:26,899 --> 00:57:31,029
Once upon a time,
near a shitty little town,

571
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:36,837
there was a farmer who fell
in love with a white witch.

572
00:57:37,576 --> 00:57:40,204
<i>And with their two beautiful children,</i>

573
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:43,047
<i>oh, they were so happy.</i>

574
00:57:44,583 --> 00:57:47,051
<i>But not for long.</i>

575
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:52,879
<i>During a Blood Moon, there is a potion</i>

576
00:57:53,258 --> 00:57:56,056
<i>that will make you immune to fire.</i>

577
00:57:57,262 --> 00:57:59,389
<i>The key to the potion</i>

578
00:57:59,498 --> 00:58:03,798
<i>is the heart of a Grand White Witch.</i>

579
00:58:04,937 --> 00:58:08,805
<i>But your mother,
the most powerful white witch,</i>

580
00:58:08,941 --> 00:58:10,909
<i>was too strong for us.</i>

581
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,874
<i>So it had to be you, Gretel.</i>

582
00:58:14,246 --> 00:58:17,511
<i>It had to be your heart.</i>

583
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:22,444
<i>As the Blood Moon approached,
I sent out a little rumour</i>

584
00:58:23,422 --> 00:58:25,413
<i>to the people of Augsburg.</i>

585
00:58:26,158 --> 00:58:28,285
<i>And when she knew they were coming,</i>

586
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,490
<i>she had your father take you
into the forest to hide you.</i>

587
00:58:31,597 --> 00:58:32,928
Father! Wait!

588
00:58:34,066 --> 00:58:35,055
Don't let her get away!

589
00:58:35,167 --> 00:58:36,828
<i>She didn't know what
they would do to her,</i>

590
00:58:36,935 --> 00:58:39,233
<i>but she was too proud to run.</i>

591
00:58:39,605 --> 00:58:43,541
<i>And a white witch would never use her
magic against humans.</i>

592
00:58:45,244 --> 00:58:47,235
<i>When your father came back for her...</i>

593
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,469
No!

594
00:58:49,581 --> 00:58:51,344
<i>... they hanged him.</i>

595
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:53,577
- Run him up!
- No!

596
00:58:55,454 --> 00:58:57,752
<i>... right in front</i>

597
00:58:58,457 --> 00:59:02,086
<i>of your mother's burning flesh!</i>

598
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:11,168
<i>Adrianna was gone.</i>

599
00:59:13,205 --> 00:59:15,435
<i>But so was your heart.</i>

600
00:59:17,142 --> 00:59:19,770
<i>And the Blood Moon passed.</i>

601
00:59:20,712 --> 00:59:22,009
The end.

602
00:59:22,814 --> 00:59:25,647
It's a beautiful story, don't you think?

603
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:29,446
They died to save you.

604
00:59:31,723 --> 00:59:32,951
And all your life,

605
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:35,150
how you've hated them.

606
00:59:35,661 --> 00:59:37,390
Tomorrow

607
00:59:37,496 --> 00:59:40,829
sisters from all dark corners of the land

608
00:59:40,933 --> 00:59:43,663
will join me in the light
of the Blood Moon

609
00:59:44,169 --> 00:59:46,637
for the greatest Sabbath of all.

610
00:59:47,673 --> 00:59:49,470
The only thing left

611
00:59:50,342 --> 00:59:52,640
is the everlasting power

612
00:59:53,178 --> 00:59:54,805
of the heart

613
00:59:55,247 --> 00:59:57,477
of a Grand White Witch.

614
00:59:57,583 --> 00:59:58,709
You know, you talk too much.

615
01:00:09,528 --> 01:00:11,894
Bad move, witch hunter.

616
01:00:17,703 --> 01:00:19,330
Hansel!

617
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,348
Drink it. It will help the pain.

618
01:00:34,553 --> 01:00:35,679
Mina?

619
01:00:42,227 --> 01:00:43,785
What did you do?

620
01:00:43,895 --> 01:00:45,362
Mina?

621
01:00:52,471 --> 01:00:53,768
You're a witch?

622
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:56,065
There are good witches in the world.

623
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:58,369
- Not many, but some.
- You stay back.

624
01:00:58,644 --> 01:00:59,975
I'm a witch, but I won't hurt you.

625
01:01:00,145 --> 01:01:02,443
I checked you. You were...
You were clean.

626
01:01:02,547 --> 01:01:04,674
Yeah, but only the dark witches
bear the signs.

627
01:01:04,816 --> 01:01:07,216
Dark witches?
What are you talking about?

628
01:01:07,386 --> 01:01:08,353
Think about it,

629
01:01:08,487 --> 01:01:11,456
if their spells don't work on you,
why would mine?

630
01:01:12,491 --> 01:01:14,118
I'm not like them, Hansel.

631
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:20,728
Gretel. Shit.

632
01:01:22,267 --> 01:01:24,895
- Where are you going?
- They have my sister.

633
01:01:25,037 --> 01:01:26,664
Who has your sister?

634
01:01:26,772 --> 01:01:28,740
Witches have my sister. They...

635
01:01:28,974 --> 01:01:30,601
- Where?
- They said something

636
01:01:31,176 --> 01:01:34,270
about a ritual or a gathering.
I don't know.

637
01:01:34,446 --> 01:01:37,643
There's a place deep in the forest,
nearby the mountains.

638
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:40,943
A place dark witches use
for their Sabbath.

639
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,347
Where is it?

640
01:01:42,454 --> 01:01:43,421
Hansel, I...

641
01:01:43,522 --> 01:01:44,887
Mina, how do I get there?

642
01:01:45,023 --> 01:01:46,820
If there is a Sabbath,
there will be many witches.

643
01:01:46,925 --> 01:01:49,587
They'll be too powerful.
They'll kill you, Hansel.

644
01:01:50,462 --> 01:01:51,861
I don't have time for this.

645
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:55,329
No, listen, Hansel,
I found something here, in this cave.

646
01:01:56,134 --> 01:01:59,934
Something very powerful.
Something that could help us.

647
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:03,403
<i>The Abramelin Grimoire! It exists!</i>

648
01:02:03,508 --> 01:02:05,271
This is the book
of protection against black magic.

649
01:02:06,912 --> 01:02:09,380
I can't believe this.
Where did you find it?

650
01:02:09,481 --> 01:02:11,005
Don't ask, kid.

651
01:02:11,183 --> 01:02:12,548
If this thing does what it says,

652
01:02:12,651 --> 01:02:14,380
it will allow us
to penetrate their protection.

653
01:02:14,486 --> 01:02:15,453
Oh, yeah?

654
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:18,214
Their wands won't
protect them anymore.

655
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:19,357
We just need something to bless.

656
01:02:19,524 --> 01:02:21,822
Okay, let's start with this.

657
01:02:46,518 --> 01:02:48,713
I hope this works.

658
01:02:58,029 --> 01:02:59,326
You ever shoot a gun?

659
01:03:00,532 --> 01:03:03,000
Well, I did win the county fair

660
01:03:04,035 --> 01:03:05,468
three times.

661
01:03:07,205 --> 01:03:09,503
All right. In that case...

662
01:03:13,879 --> 01:03:15,744
Don't touch the gun.

663
01:03:32,564 --> 01:03:33,531
Edward.

664
01:03:35,066 --> 01:03:36,693
What are you doing here?

665
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,437
What's going on?

666
01:03:44,409 --> 01:03:46,036
Muriel.

667
01:03:52,751 --> 01:03:54,184
Edward,

668
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:56,480
I need your help.

669
01:04:01,426 --> 01:04:03,053
Please, Edward.

670
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:10,233
Hey! You filthy oaf!

671
01:04:10,335 --> 01:04:12,803
Get the children. We're moving out.

672
01:04:17,776 --> 01:04:20,404
It's time.

673
01:04:30,856 --> 01:04:31,914
Okay, are we good?

674
01:04:32,757 --> 01:04:33,883
Yes.

675
01:04:45,036 --> 01:04:48,597
Well, as far as you go, kid.

676
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:52,339
But, I will leave you with this.

677
01:04:54,546 --> 01:04:56,207
- Wow!
- Find a place to hide.

678
01:04:56,348 --> 01:04:57,406
Shoot anything that moves.

679
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:00,347
Good luck.

680
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,037
Shut up!

681
01:05:46,064 --> 01:05:47,429
After tonight,

682
01:05:48,233 --> 01:05:51,532
no sister will be burned on their pyres!

683
01:05:53,672 --> 01:05:56,903
No sister will be ashes on the ground!

684
01:05:57,108 --> 01:05:59,076
I want your brains!

685
01:05:59,978 --> 01:06:00,945
And now,

686
01:06:02,247 --> 01:06:04,977
now we feast!

687
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:07,345
That's a lot of witches.

688
01:06:08,386 --> 01:06:09,353
Okay.

689
01:06:09,921 --> 01:06:11,946
I'm going to go down
around the other side.

690
01:06:12,424 --> 01:06:15,052
Push them into the middle,
get them away from the kids.

691
01:06:15,327 --> 01:06:18,057
Now, when you see my signal,
you unleash hell.

692
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:19,727
Wish me luck.

693
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:29,438
Yes.

694
01:06:30,809 --> 01:06:33,642
The hour has come!

695
01:06:34,446 --> 01:06:37,244
The Blood Moon arrives!

696
01:06:37,949 --> 01:06:43,546
The Grand White Witch dies!

697
01:06:50,128 --> 01:06:52,255
Listen to me carefully!

698
01:06:52,964 --> 01:06:56,422
If you let my sister
and the children go now,

699
01:06:56,968 --> 01:07:00,267
I'll consider not killing
each and every one of you.

700
01:07:01,473 --> 01:07:02,940
- Finish him.
- Yes.

701
01:07:13,318 --> 01:07:14,683
Please work.

702
01:08:05,703 --> 01:08:09,161
We have to hurry. You get the children.
I'll get her heart!

703
01:08:09,641 --> 01:08:10,938
Now, move!

704
01:08:39,737 --> 01:08:40,863
Walk!

705
01:08:41,239 --> 01:08:42,365
Move it!

706
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:49,638
Come on!

707
01:08:49,747 --> 01:08:50,714
Gretel!

708
01:08:56,354 --> 01:08:57,548
Edward.

709
01:08:58,022 --> 01:08:58,989
Gretel!

710
01:09:00,058 --> 01:09:02,322
I'm okay! Go get the children!

711
01:09:03,928 --> 01:09:04,986
Stay still!

712
01:09:07,932 --> 01:09:10,059
Get off of me!

713
01:09:29,354 --> 01:09:30,480
No!

714
01:09:43,301 --> 01:09:44,598
Thank you!

715
01:10:13,364 --> 01:10:14,729
- Shit!
- Too late.

716
01:10:24,008 --> 01:10:25,134
Gretel!

717
01:10:47,532 --> 01:10:48,999
Well, where are you going?

718
01:10:49,234 --> 01:10:50,531
I have to help Edward!

719
01:10:50,802 --> 01:10:53,771
Edward. Who the fuck's Edward?

720
01:11:42,053 --> 01:11:44,146
- Hell, yeah!
- Ben!

721
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:47,451
Hansel! Hansel!

722
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:49,684
I did it! I shot her! Muriel.

723
01:11:49,794 --> 01:11:52,763
- Where?
- I shot her down, over there.

724
01:11:52,897 --> 01:11:54,023
Good job.

725
01:12:01,406 --> 01:12:02,873
She's close.

726
01:12:14,285 --> 01:12:15,445
Edward?

727
01:12:59,597 --> 01:13:01,497
You can't be serious.

728
01:13:15,079 --> 01:13:16,546
Is this...

729
01:13:16,981 --> 01:13:18,539
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

730
01:13:19,517 --> 01:13:20,484
Wow.

731
01:13:20,752 --> 01:13:24,711
Whatever you do,
don't eat the fucking candy.

732
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:38,965
Stop right there,

733
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:41,065
or the little boy dies.

734
01:13:42,306 --> 01:13:45,275
I thought it would
be fitting for us to end up here,

735
01:13:45,643 --> 01:13:47,167
where it all began.

736
01:13:47,812 --> 01:13:50,280
Kind of lost its charm a little, huh?

737
01:13:50,882 --> 01:13:52,179
Drop it.

738
01:13:57,722 --> 01:13:58,689
Good boy.

739
01:14:00,324 --> 01:14:01,291
Don't worry, kid.

740
01:14:03,161 --> 01:14:04,287
I'm not going to let her hurt you.

741
01:14:04,529 --> 01:14:05,496
Oh, really?

742
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:07,627
Really.

743
01:14:17,842 --> 01:14:19,537
The end is near,

744
01:14:20,411 --> 01:14:21,639
witch hunter.

745
01:14:23,681 --> 01:14:28,516
I wish I could say
it would be painless, but that

746
01:14:29,387 --> 01:14:31,321
would be a lie.

747
01:14:38,729 --> 01:14:39,753
Get away from him.

748
01:14:41,232 --> 01:14:43,530
Always funny seeing
a white witch with a wand.

749
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:48,371
What are you going to do?
Hit me with your love spell?

750
01:14:52,243 --> 01:14:53,710
Not bad.

751
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:03,208
Sacrificing yourself to save a human.

752
01:15:03,921 --> 01:15:05,218
Pathetic.

753
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:12,490
No!

754
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:20,394
Mina. Hey.

755
01:15:20,972 --> 01:15:22,166
Come here.

756
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:27,407
Hansel.

757
01:15:31,282 --> 01:15:32,249
Hansel.

758
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,517
I tried to stop her.

759
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,980
You did. You did good.

760
01:15:38,456 --> 01:15:39,923
You did good.

761
01:16:11,489 --> 01:16:13,684
You got to be fucking kidding me.

762
01:17:19,123 --> 01:17:20,784
Oh, please.

763
01:17:20,958 --> 01:17:22,152
Please?

764
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,850
Please, stop.

765
01:17:25,529 --> 01:17:26,757
Please.

766
01:17:26,964 --> 01:17:27,953
Yeah, nice try.

767
01:18:40,938 --> 01:18:42,098
Finish her already.

768
01:19:05,529 --> 01:19:08,089
<i>Revenge doesn't change the past.</i>

769
01:19:12,303 --> 01:19:14,328
<i>It won't bring our parents back.</i>

770
01:19:14,705 --> 01:19:16,673
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

771
01:19:16,974 --> 01:19:18,601
Glad to hear it.

772
01:19:19,477 --> 01:19:20,705
<i>But it sure as hell feels good.</i>

773
01:19:24,648 --> 01:19:27,014
<i>My sister and I know the truth.</i>

774
01:19:28,886 --> 01:19:30,854
<i>We know who we are now.</i>

775
01:19:32,757 --> 01:19:34,156
<i>And so do they.</i>

776
01:19:36,694 --> 01:19:38,491
<i>They know our story,</i>

777
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,730
<i>our powers,</i>

778
01:19:41,732 --> 01:19:42,756
<i>what we can do.</i>

779
01:19:45,035 --> 01:19:46,662
<i>And they should fear us.</i>

780
01:19:49,907 --> 01:19:50,874
<i>All of us.</i>

781
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:53,036
We should be getting close now.

782
01:19:53,277 --> 01:19:55,575
And so after this next one,
we've got three more to go.

783
01:19:55,846 --> 01:19:59,304
Three? You said three more
three witches ago.

784
01:19:59,550 --> 01:20:01,745
Come on, you always say,
more witches, more money, right?

785
01:20:01,952 --> 01:20:03,852
Yeah, but you ain't getting any of it.

786
01:20:03,954 --> 01:20:05,182
Unless you want to pull the cart.

787
01:20:07,424 --> 01:20:08,721
Right, big guy?

788
01:20:08,993 --> 01:20:10,153
I told you he'd come in handy.

789
01:20:12,062 --> 01:20:14,360
<i>There are good witches in the world.</i>

790
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:16,692
<i>We know that now.</i>

791
01:20:17,568 --> 01:20:21,129
<i>But for the ones practicing
the black arts, beware.</i>

792
01:20:21,238 --> 01:20:22,899
<i>We're coming for you.</i>

793
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:26,269
<i>No matter where you are, we'll find you.</i>

794
01:20:28,145 --> 01:20:29,874
<i>And dead or alive,</i>

795
01:20:30,881 --> 01:20:32,314
<i>we'll take you down.</i>

796
01:20:32,683 --> 01:20:34,913
Edward, want to knock?

797
01:20:35,286 --> 01:20:36,617
<i>My vote:</i>

798
01:20:37,521 --> 01:20:39,045
<i>Dead.</i>

799
01:21:04,415 --> 01:21:07,816
I hate to break it to you,
but it's not going to be an open casket.
