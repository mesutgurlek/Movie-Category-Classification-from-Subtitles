Not yet.

I'm telling you,
we don't need this guy.

488
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,057
Well, I think we do.

489
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,761
Evidently, this guy's quite
the big shot in Washington.

490

What's his name?

His name is Johann Krauss.

492

Johann Krauss?
Sounds German.

493

He's the top man in...

"He has a nice open face."

Bought and sold on

Crammed into
cargo containers.

509

Smuggled, abused.

510
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,223
He has very
expressive hands.

511
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,360
The seal on the box
worries me also.

512

A warring emblem.

513

Yes, from the Bethmoora clan.

Your file says you're the
brains of the operation,

I'm impressed.

In my file, you'll see,
Mr. Krauss,

518

<i>Ja,</i> okay.

520

Let's see what our little
friend here can remember.

521
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,980
Memory gets a little sketchy
right after you've burned to death.

But maybe Saint

Oh, no, no.
No amulets, <i>Mein Herr.</i>

Teleplasty.

525
00:36:38,996 --> 00:36:40,520
Plastic. Very modern.

Teleplasty by which
an ectoplasmic medium,

Wow. You're a genius.

places the troll
market directly under

Give it up, nasty.
We can see you.

642
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:06,153

How? How do you see me?

We're looking
for the entrance

645
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:12,862
to the troll market.
Any clues?

646
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,160
Come any closer and
I'll rip your heart.

647
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,995
We're gonna have to get
a little old-school, Abe.

648
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,796
Give me the bird.

649
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,032
Not a canary.

00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:24,870
What, you're afraid
of this little guy?

651
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,239
Who'd know?

652
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,538
No more, no more.

653
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,101
I'll take you there.

654
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,912
Come on, let's go,
you dirty old troll.

655
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,369
Let's go.

656
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,166
Agent Sherman, we are
going into the troll market.

657
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,605
Keep communication
to a minimum.

You see, this is
a man who takes charge.

661
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:03,637
You think?

662
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:04,840
Yeah. He's efficient.

663
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,746
He's precise.

664
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:09,251
You add "resistant" to that,
you got yourself a new watch.

665

Dr. Krauss is aware of the

Not good.

00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,617
Open it, Lucy.

677
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,211
I will not.

678
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,517

Rip my insides and
my legs and my tongue,

684
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:58,231

open that door.

It said "never."

689

It's unconscionable.

he didn't like it.

Yes, I think I will.

My cigar, it was Cuban.

809
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,224
Now you pissed me off.

Give it up, pal.
It's over.

824
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,314
I wouldn't do that

Look at this!
Now we have to leave.

To wage his war,
my brother needs this,

837
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,263
the final piece of
the Crown of Bethmoora

838

and this map to the location
of the Golden Army chamber.

No. Where it goes, I go.

My father died to uphold
the truce with your world.

I take it you're vouching for her,
Agent Sapien?

849
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:05,083
Most emphatically.
Yes, I am.
