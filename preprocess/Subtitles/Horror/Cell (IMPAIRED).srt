Always considered
myself a pacifist,

I want to talk.

Maybe ring the doorbell.
What's the worst that can happen?

341

It was like they all

How else do you

- So now they're psychic?
- <i>Telepathic.</i>

Like maybe the pulse

don't you think
they might have bailed?

Clay: If they're safe,
they would have left a message.

402

Lost most of my money in the great collapse of '08.

403

Miss.
Welcome to Gaiten Academy.

00:36:34,462 --> 00:36:38,730
If you folks need a place to stay for the night,
we have plenty of rooms.

412
00:36:38,732 --> 00:36:41,499
The boys who didn't have
cell phones have all run off.

<i>The ones</i>
<i>who did have them--</i>

Oh, we know about that.

415
00:36:45,438 --> 00:36:48,705
I'm Jordan.
I'm a scholarship boy.

416
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,207
- I lived in Holloway.
- Good for you, Jordan.

417
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,909
Yes, sir.
That's what the Head said, too.

Charles Ardai.
Headmaster.

419
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,747
Quite a problem these cell phones have caused now,
isn't it?

(Chuckles)

421

Nice.
It's apt.

423
00:37:06,488 --> 00:37:08,387
Clay:
What's with the music?

424
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:10,956
Did you ever play
musical chairs as a child?

425
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,892
- Yeah.
- Well, as long as the music doesn't stop,

426
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:16,494
we've got nothing
to worry about.

427
00:37:16,496 --> 00:37:19,864
We'll have a quick peek,
then we'll go over to Cheatham Lodge for dinner.

428
00:37:19,866 --> 00:37:23,234
It's not 200 yards to
Tonney Field, I promise.

Tom: <i>How can you be so sure of that?</i>

434
00:37:43,384 --> 00:37:45,350
Observe.

435
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:47,552
- What the hell are you doing?
- (Cocks gun)

436
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:49,620
Charles: No, no,
he's calm. He's calm.

437
00:37:49,622 --> 00:37:52,856
<i>I could put my sword cane</i>
<i>right through his throat</i>

438
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:54,657
<i>and he wouldn't</i>
<i>try to stop me.</i>

439
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:57,660
Nor would those around him
spring to his defense.

440
00:37:57,662 --> 00:37:59,762
Of course, if I tried
it in the daylight,

441
00:37:59,764 --> 00:38:01,630
they'd tear me limb
from limb.

442
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:03,832
The music comes from
their mouths, too.

443
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:06,401
It's not hardly a whisper,
but you can hear it.

444
00:38:09,472 --> 00:38:11,972
- Come here.
- That's got to be your imagination.

445
00:38:11,974 --> 00:38:14,274
- There's no way that they're actually talking.
- <i>Come listen.</i>

446
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:23,282
It's like
they don't breathe.

447
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:27,785
I can hear it.
I can hear it.

448
00:38:27,787 --> 00:38:30,554
How is that even possible
without a transmitter?

449
00:38:30,556 --> 00:38:34,391
They are transmitting.
It's a new skill they seem to have picked up.

450
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:36,626
And they're changing
at an alarming rate.

451
00:38:36,628 --> 00:38:40,296
Alice: Can we please move this conversation inside?

452
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:42,064
Please.

453
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,536
Charles:
<i>We cannot overestimate</i>

<i>the developmental leaps</i>
<i>we're witnessing here.</i>

455

They appear
to be eusocial.

456
00:38:53,975 --> 00:38:56,842
Like a colony
of bees or ants.

<i>They act for the good</i>
<i>of the group as a whole.</i>

458
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:02,513
There's no competitiveness,
no selfishness.

459
00:39:02,515 --> 00:39:06,450
In fact,
they may be the next stage in human evolution.

460
00:39:06,452 --> 00:39:09,019
Every human
on planet Earth

461
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:12,022
will be part
of one giant organism.

462
00:39:12,024 --> 00:39:15,358
No individuality.
No privacy. Come on.

463
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,461
No war.
No resource depletion.

464
00:39:18,463 --> 00:39:20,529
- No conflict.
- No, thank you.

465
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:23,899
<i>As to what they're doing at</i>
<i>night as they lie there so still,</i>

466
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:27,802
open-eyed and listening
to their music,

467
00:39:27,804 --> 00:39:29,370
we think
they're rebooting.

Yeah, I mean,
what is a brain?

472
00:39:41,015 --> 00:39:43,815
It's just a big
old hard drive.

473
00:39:43,817 --> 00:39:45,650

<i>An infinity of bytes.</i>

<i>If your brain were an info strip on a hard drive,</i>

478

it would say something like
2 % in use, 98 % available.

Clay: <i>Neal Stephenson,</i>

What are you suggesting?

491
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,521
I think what's happening now is
more than temporary anarchy.

492
00:40:31,523 --> 00:40:34,457
I think it's the start

Well, even with

it'll be slow work.

01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,110
Help me bring her up.
Help me bring her up.

786
01:03:29,112 --> 01:03:30,811
Bring her up.
Okay.

<i>(Birds cawing)</i>

788
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:39,418
Let it snow.

789
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:44,755
'Cause then we can
build a fort.

790
01:03:45,924 --> 01:03:48,157
Or a leaf.

791
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:52,960
Or a bird.
We can build a bird.

792
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:58,965
We can make
a snowman.

793
01:04:02,236 --> 01:04:03,902
Or we could play
the slinky one.

794
01:04:18,451 --> 01:04:21,452
(Sniffles)
I'm so sorry, buddy.

You know, back in the tavern,
they attacked at night.

797
01:05:13,603 --> 01:05:15,836
The Head said
this would happen.

798
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:19,339
He also said they'd find new ways
of maintaining their numbers.

799
01:05:19,341 --> 01:05:21,374
You saw what happened
back there, right?

800
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:24,210
They're not just killing anymore,
they're recruiting.

801
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:26,845
The pulse is coming
from their mouths now.

802
01:05:26,847 --> 01:05:29,580
They don't need
phones anymore.

808
01:06:13,954 --> 01:06:16,454
- Who are you?
- Why don't you put your shotgun down, my friend?

809
01:06:16,456 --> 01:06:18,422
I'll be happy
to tell you who I am.

810
01:06:20,025 --> 01:06:22,392
I'm Ray Huizenga
from Groveland, Mass.

811
01:06:22,394 --> 01:06:26,062
This young lady here,
Denise Link from Haverhill, neighboring town.

812
01:06:26,064 --> 01:06:27,930
Meetcha.

813
01:06:27,932 --> 01:06:30,065
Ray: <i>But our names don't actually matter anymore.</i>

814
01:06:30,067 --> 01:06:32,934
What matters-- what matters is what we do.

815
01:06:32,936 --> 01:06:36,570
And what we do, hmm?
We kill phone freaks.

816
01:06:36,572 --> 01:06:39,171
Yeah, yeah,
we kill them.

817
01:06:41,141 --> 01:06:42,273
Just like you.

818
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:46,376
Denise:
<i>The second time in Nashua,</i>

819
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:48,578
<i>we used dynamite from</i>
<i>a construction site shed.</i>

820
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:51,380
<i>Ray knew how to rig the dynamite</i>
<i>from when he worked on a road crew.</i>

821
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:54,182
Ray: That's when we started
seeing those Kashwak No-Fo signs.

822
01:06:54,184 --> 01:06:55,917
Denise: <i>Kashwak.</i>
<i>They're telling people</i>

823
01:06:55,919 --> 01:06:57,685
<i>it's a no-phone zone,</i>
<i>but that's a lie.</i>

824
01:06:57,687 --> 01:07:00,320
The area got an Indian
casino built there last year

825
01:07:00,322 --> 01:07:02,422
and finally put up
a cell phone tower.

826
01:07:02,424 --> 01:07:05,224
The phoners are trying to draw us there in our dreams,
but it's a trap.

827
01:07:05,226 --> 01:07:08,193
Ray: <i>Yeah,
and the dreams started coming after we blasted.</i>

828
01:07:08,195 --> 01:07:10,562
I mean, we blasted.
That first flock, we blasted them.

829
01:07:10,564 --> 01:07:13,998
- You know, powerful dreams. Powerful dreams, like--
- Tom: We've had them.

830
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,133
Ray: <i>Always that phoner.</i>
<i>The phoner in the red hoodie.</i>

831
01:07:16,135 --> 01:07:17,934
- <i>They call him the President of the Internet.</i>
- Yeah.

832
01:07:17,936 --> 01:07:19,502
Got to be taken down.
I mean down.

833
01:07:19,504 --> 01:07:21,570
Like, down, like--

834
01:07:21,572 --> 01:07:24,239
like right there.

835
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:26,207
We've got to take him
all the way down.

836
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,976
You know what I'm saying?
You take him all the way down.

837
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:31,579
<i>If you kill him-- you kill him-- you put him in here,</i>

838
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:33,647
<i>the rest will-- they'll surrender.</i>
<i>They'll quit.</i>

839
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:37,384
They'll stop.
Just... poof.

840
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,386
<i>But it's not gonna be easy.</i>
<i>Know why?</i>

841
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,755
<i>Know why?</i>
<i>'Cause they get inside of people's minds.</i>

842
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:43,289
They get inside
of people's minds.

843
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:44,757
They get inside
your mind, Ray?

844
01:07:44,759 --> 01:07:47,693
No, nothing in my mind.
Because I stay up, hmm?

845
01:07:47,695 --> 01:07:49,661
<i>I've been awake, what, four, five,</i>
<i>six-- six days now?</i>

846
01:07:49,663 --> 01:07:51,295
- Clay: <i>That's great.</i>
- Denise: <i>It's true.</i>

847
01:07:51,297 --> 01:07:53,196
She sleeps in there,
I'm out here guarding.

848
01:07:53,198 --> 01:07:55,431
I'll pace all night.
I'll be all over this park.

849
01:07:55,433 --> 01:07:57,833
- Mary had a little lamb. She's my Mary.
- Aw.

850
01:07:57,835 --> 01:08:00,101
- <i>It's not my kid. Not my kid.</i>
- Denise: <i>No.</i>

851
01:08:00,103 --> 01:08:02,069
Ray: <i>But she's my Mary.</i>
<i>I'm looking after her.</i>

852
01:08:02,071 --> 01:08:04,404
That's great.
Sounds like you guys are in a good place.

853
01:08:04,406 --> 01:08:06,305
Oh, yeah.

854
01:08:06,307 --> 01:08:09,107
But you know what?
We can resist as long as we stay awake.

855
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:12,610
Staying awake is key.
We just stay away from the flocks.

856
01:08:12,612 --> 01:08:14,745
How you plan
on doing that?

857
01:08:14,747 --> 01:08:18,381
Ray: <i>Oh, we got ourselves a canary in a coal mine,
my friend.</i>

858
01:08:18,383 --> 01:08:22,351
Hey, Denise, you want to show them and
I'll finish cooking the burgers with your son?

859
01:08:25,122 --> 01:08:27,489
Denise: <i>My brother's doing more to help me out now</i>

860
01:08:27,491 --> 01:08:29,657
<i>than he ever did</i>
<i>when he was human.</i>

861
01:08:29,659 --> 01:08:32,226
I still hate
to see him like this.

862
01:08:33,362 --> 01:08:35,228
- He's a phoner?
- Yup.

863
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:37,863
<i>Yeah, he's like</i>
<i>a little calf</i>

864
01:08:37,865 --> 01:08:40,632
that broke off from
the herd and got lost.

865
01:08:40,634 --> 01:08:42,567
On its own, he's nothing.

866
01:08:42,569 --> 01:08:45,703
He just sits here and waits for
them to come back and find it

867
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:47,204
or else he dies.

868
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,673
God, he hasn't
been eating.

869
01:08:50,675 --> 01:08:52,574
Come on,
don't do this to me.

870
01:08:52,576 --> 01:08:55,810
If a flock passes
within a mile or so,

871
01:08:55,812 --> 01:08:58,846
he starts coming to
and acting up.

872
01:08:58,848 --> 01:09:01,648
The closer they are,
the crazier he gets.

873
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:03,716
That's why we got
him covered up.

874
01:09:03,718 --> 01:09:06,652
We don't want him showing them where
we are and bringing them down on us.

875
01:09:06,654 --> 01:09:10,188
<i>(Sighs) Come on,</i>
<i>don't do this to me.</i>

876
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:12,857

877
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:16,726
Sometimes I think he can
still recognize my voice.

878
01:09:19,263 --> 01:09:22,364
- You think they can be rehabbed?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

879
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:24,733
Johnny's voice: Are you coming home?
Are you coming home?

880
01:09:24,735 --> 01:09:27,135
- Tom: What the hell's going on?
- Are you coming home?

881
01:09:27,137 --> 01:09:29,604
I have no idea.
He never said anything before.

882
01:09:29,606 --> 01:09:31,606
<i>Are you coming home?</i>
<i>Are you coming home?</i>

- Tom: <i>Do not listen to that shit.</i>
- Are you coming home?

888
01:09:40,515 --> 01:09:42,715
You know
that is not your son.

889
01:09:42,717 --> 01:09:44,917
- <i>Clay, no!</i>
- Hi, Dad.

890

Tom: <i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

892
01:09:50,357 --> 01:09:52,557
- <i>He was my brother.</i>
- <i>He saw us, that means they saw us.</i>

893
01:09:52,559 --> 01:09:54,492
He'll lead the rest of them to us.
Come on.

894
01:09:54,494 --> 01:09:56,293
Ray: <i>Hey,
we all need to go now.</i>

895
01:09:56,295 --> 01:09:57,894
- Tom: <i>Come on.</i>
- Ray: <i>Everybody to the truck.</i>

896
01:09:57,896 --> 01:09:59,729
<i>Clay, come on.</i>

897
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,935
<i>(Engine stops)</i>

898
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:50,477
Why are we
stopping, Ray?

899
01:11:32,754 --> 01:11:35,654
Ray: <i>No, it's too late for me.</i>
<i>It's too late for me because they're in my head.</i>

900
01:11:35,656 --> 01:11:38,256
At first it was in my dreams,
but now I'm seeing stuff when I'm awake.

901
01:11:38,258 --> 01:11:40,825
Things that aren't there.
(Screams)

902
01:11:40,827 --> 01:11:43,694
You haven't slept for a week.
Maybe you were hallucinating.

903
01:11:43,696 --> 01:11:45,662
I'm hallucinating because that asshole in the red hoodie

904
01:11:45,664 --> 01:11:47,296
is putting thoughts
in my mind.

905
01:11:47,298 --> 01:11:48,664
And what the Prez wants,
he's not gonna get

906
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:50,465
because you're
not gonna let him.

907
01:11:50,467 --> 01:11:52,633
They thought it was me,
but it wasn't me.

908
01:11:52,635 --> 01:11:54,468
It wasn't me, it's you.
He was wrong.

909
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:56,770
<i>You're the man, my artist.</i>
<i>You are it.</i>

910
01:11:56,772 --> 01:11:58,605
What's that around
your neck, Ray?

911
01:11:58,607 --> 01:12:00,006
I don't like it that you're
holding on to your kid

912
01:12:00,008 --> 01:12:01,907
because your kid is done.
Your kid is done.

913
01:12:01,909 --> 01:12:04,342
You know it in your heart
that your kid is toast.

914
01:12:04,344 --> 01:12:06,043
- Your kid is toast.
- No, I don't.

915
01:12:06,045 --> 01:12:08,512
I don't know that.

916
01:12:08,514 --> 01:12:11,548
(Groans)

917
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:13,016
Oh!

918
01:12:13,018 --> 01:12:15,618
Here. Here.

919
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:18,520
I'm passing the torch.
I'm passing it on to you.

920
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:23,691
When the time comes,
call the number on the slip.

921
01:12:23,693 --> 01:12:25,659
You'll know the time.
I hope you know the time.

922
01:12:25,661 --> 01:12:28,395
- What time is that, Ray?
- The end of the road time.

923
01:12:28,397 --> 01:12:30,997
The end of the road.
Mmm.

924
01:12:30,999 --> 01:12:34,567
No other options.

925
01:12:34,569 --> 01:12:38,404
Ray, what's that
around your neck?

926
01:12:38,406 --> 01:12:40,005
(Sighs)

927
01:12:40,007 --> 01:12:42,440
(groans)

928
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:45,776
- This, my friend, this is gonna--
- <i>Ray.</i>

929
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,844
This is gonna blow my mind.
You better step away, my friend.

930
01:12:47,846 --> 01:12:51,314
- Okay. Hold on.
- <i>Step away, Clay!</i>

931
01:12:51,316 --> 01:12:54,016
