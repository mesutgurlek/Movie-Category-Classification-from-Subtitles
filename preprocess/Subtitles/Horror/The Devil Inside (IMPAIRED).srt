Victim number one is facing north.

12

Facing west.

20
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,798
In the victim's right hand,
we have religious paraphernalia,

We find victim number three.

25

Male, approximately 210 pounds.

26

We have trauma to the head.

27
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,822
Apparent strangulation with rope,

In the center of the room,
we have a chair.

31

ANNOUNCER: <i>WJBP, Channel 11.</i>

37
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,754
A quiet South Hartford community

38
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,428
was leveled by tragedy as
three clergy members were found dead.

39

At about 11:47 p.m.
on Sunday evening, the 20th,

40
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,684

43
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,934
We checked the location for any
other victims and have not found any.

REPORTER: <i>Apparently,
Maria Rossi was hosting</i>

45

REPORTER: <i>Mrs. Rossi was found
by police in a crawl space.</i>

49
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,404
We can't speculate <i>as</i> to what

50
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,156
<i>the cause or the motive may have been.</i>

51

They are not ruling out any possibilities.

52

we don't want to speculate</i>

the cause.</i>

<i>My name is Isabella Rossi</i>

55
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,386
and that was my mother.

56
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,386
<i>The thing you have to understand
about my mother</i>

57
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,392
is that she just had a huge heart.

(SINGING) <i>Down came the rain

Can you see that?

62
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,951
That was my first birthday party.

63
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,123
<i>And I don't think it was until I was</i>

64
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,170
about six years old that
I actually started to notice, you know,

65
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,668
<i>something was different,
her moods were changing.</i>

66
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,215
<i>Then, she went away for a little bit</i>

67
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,258
<i>and when she came back
they said she was better.</i>

68
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,171
But she wasn't.

69
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,631
<i>We couldn't understand
what was happening.</i>

<i>No one had answers.</i>

MICHAEL SCHAEFER:
So why are you doing this film?

72
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,805
Because I really need to

73
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,318
understand what happened.

74
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,321
What Maria Rossi did,
and her subsequent life,

75
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,784
was incredibly tragic and clouded.

76
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:07,493
And caught in the middle of it
is a daughter who is just now learning

77
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,374
<i>the circumstances of that tragedy.</i>

78
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,005
MARIA: <i>Isabella,
look at the camera, honey.</i>

79
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,213
<i>If someone had asked me</i>

80
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:19,718
how is it possible for Mrs. Rossi
to have done what she did,

81
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,517
I would have gone through the list
of things that cause human aggression.

82
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,012
Something like major depression,
or schizophrenia,

83
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,393
<i>or dissociative identity disorder.</i>

84
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,724
<i>It's my understanding</i>

85
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,856
that her current psychiatric diagnosis
has been D.I.D.

86
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:38,653
But this is her seventh different
diagnosis since 1987.

87
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,574
ISABELLA: <i>You start wondering,
is it in my genes?</i>

You know,
am I going to flip out one day?

89

<i>Just a matter of time?</i>

90
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,880
Two years after she brutally murdered
three people in her home,

91
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,172
a South Hartford jury

92
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,343
<i>found Maria Rossi not guilty
by reason of insanity.</i>

93
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:01,464
Rossi was committed
to the South Hartford State Asylum.

94
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,173
ISABELLA: <i>And then in September
of that year,</i>

95
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,424
<i>my mother was transferred</i>

96
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,262
to the Centrino Mental Hospital
for the Criminally Insane in Rome, Italy.

97
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,690
<i>I never really questioned why Italy.</i>

98
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,901
MICHAEL: When did your father tell you
what really happened?

99
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:22,409
May 23, 2009. I was 25 years old.

100
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,699
<i>He just said it. He said,</i>

101
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,208
"Mom attacked those people
during an exorcism."

102
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,750
An exorcism performed on her.

103
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,960
It's the job of science to try to sort out

104
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,508
what is a reasonable,
plausible explanation.

105
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,794
But science can't explain everything,

106
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,003
such as a person

107
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,806
levitating two feet off the ground
during an exorcism.

108
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,020
I asked my dad if he thought
she was possessed.

109
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,267
He said he didn't know.

110
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,601
That she was gone. It didn't matter.

111
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,444
Not any more.

112
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,399
He died three days later.

113
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,368
<i>I called the church
where the priests had come from.</i>

114
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,664
<i>And they wouldn't talk about it.</i>

115
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,789
<i>They said they don't have
an ordained exorcist and never did.</i>

116
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:18,124
So we're on our way to see
the Vatican School for Exorcism.

117
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,466

00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:28,141
Yeah, I'm nervous.
Twenty years is a long time, you know?

<i>So, later, I was contacted
by the Diocese of Rome.</i>

121
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:36,309
<i>They told me they never authorized
my mother's exorcism.</i>

122
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,815
<i>That's when I knew I had to go to Italy.</i>

123
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,624
I wonder how seriously they take
the exorcism school, you know.

124
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,961
I hope it's not a joke.

FATHER ROBERT GALLO: From
post-traumatic shock to serious injury,

133
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,837
death even.

134
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,836
And not just for the victim.

135
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,925
Also for the family members,
for anyone in the vicinity,

136
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,005
especially the priest.

137
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,350
Sometimes a person

138
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,354
can be tormented
by more than one demon

139
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,524
in what we call
multiple demonic possession.

140
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,520
These cases are extremely
volatile and dangerous,

141
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,524
and they sometimes
lead to transference,

142
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,536
which means
the demon jumps from one person

143
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,280
to another.

144
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:19,040
The purpose of the class

I believe the subject
was clearly possessed.

- I don't have a daughter.
- Yes, yes, you do.

We just haven't seen each other
in a very long time.

322
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,232
I don't have a daughter.

00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,077
Do I?

Well, thank you for coming.
Please say hello to your family from me.

329
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,889
Have a nice day. Thank you for coming.
I have to go. I have to go.

330
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,676
I have to get ready. I have to get ready.

I have to get ready. Get ready.

332
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:11,440
Get ready.

333
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,361
You shouldn't have killed.

334
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,195
What did you say?

335
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:26,448
Maria, please. I don't have a lot of time.
Please, tell me something.

336
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,163
You shouldn't have killed your child.

337
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,218
What?

338
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,990
It's against God's will, you know.

348
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,717
<i>It feels empty.</i>

349
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,433
<i>Like there's no safety net
to fallback on.</i>

00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,060
<i>And it forces you to be resilient.</i>

351
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,602
<i>Possession and exorcism
have dictated my life.</i>

<i>It took my mom

<i>It defines me now.</i>

<i>I mean, here I am</i>

355

<i>I flew halfway across...
You know, halfway across the world</i>

356

<i>to see this woman
who I never thought I'd see again.</i>

<i>I don't like that it defines me.</i>

Father Ben Rawlings and David Keane</i>

359
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:45,132
<i>in hopes that they would review
the footage of my mother.</i>

360
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,801
Luckily, they agreed
and invited me to their loft.

361
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,737
Isabella, hi, welcome.

362
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,073
- How are you?
- Good. Come in.

363
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:13,406
It's hard to say
why I wanted to be a priest.

364
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,742
<i>Maybe I was drawn to helping people.</i>

365
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:21,710
<i>I think that duality exists within all of
us and, occasionally, it can take form.</i>

<i>Science can no longer help,
and religion has to take over.</i>

367
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,964
Which can be really difficult
for people to accept.

368
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,225
Isabella, nice to see you again.
How are you? You okay? Okay, great.

369
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,061
- Can I get you a cup of tea or anything?
- Sure.

370
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,480
I'm sorry, I forgot your...

371
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,183
- Michael.
- Michael.

372
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:44,771
My family were always very religious.

373
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,821
My mother and father,
they were teachers,

374
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:50,367
but I was closest to my uncle.
He was a priest.

375
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:55,740
<i>By the time I was 13,
he told me that he was an exorcist.</i>

376
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,662
<i>And, well,</i>

377
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,999
if you can imagine...

378
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,670
It's like, I suppose, you know,
you being told that

379
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,176
your dad is Superman.

380
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:11,676
That's what it felt like to me.
That he was in direct,

381
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:15,597
you know, war, I suppose,
with the Devil.

382
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,723
And, I don't know,
it blew me away, really.

383
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:26,229
<i>And so, he took me along with him
and by the time I was 18,</i>

384
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,360
I'd seen four exorcisms.
I'd even assisted on one.

385
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,821
And it just changes you.

386
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,992
<i>Unfortunately, he passed away
a couple years ago.</i>

387
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:39,993
Anyway, when I was 23,
I went into the priesthood.

388
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,754
And by the time I was 27,
I was an ordained exorcist.

389
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,672
<i>But I'll tell you this.</i>

390
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,926
After all the years
that I've been in the Church

391
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,846
I've seen the Devil
way more than I've seen God.

392
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,473
That's just not the way
it's supposed to be.

393
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,516
There, what did she say to you there?

394
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,979
Oh, uh...

395
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,777
Yeah, at the end there,
she started remembering things,

396
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,697
specific things,
and she said something to me.

397
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,941
But I'm not sure if she said...

398
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,694
What? What was it?

399
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,870
I terminated a pregnancy
about four years ago.

400
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,459
The doctor said
I couldn't carry it to term, so...

401
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,705
Anyway, she knew about it,
and she said that...

402
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:31,044
Something about
being against God's will or something.

403
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,299
Hang on. Let's just look at that.

404
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,556
It's against God's will, you know.

405
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:37,845
ISABELLA:
That means something, right?

406
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,144
DAVID: Possibly. You said you had
a copy of her medical charts?

407
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,345
Wait, wait, wait.

408
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:42,892
What are those?

409
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,062
ISABELLA: Oh! She cuts herself.

410
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,485
DAVID: Those are crosses, Ben.

411
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,405
Crosses? Wait, wouldn't she
not want crosses if she's possessed?

412
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,233
- Not necessarily.
- Look at them. Look at them.

413
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,819
The way that she's seeing them,
they're upside down.

414
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:01,078
They're inverted crosses.
They're typically used in Satanic rituals.

415
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,075
I don't have a daughter.

416
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,410
DAVID: Wait, is she speaking
with an accent?

417
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,245
ISABELLA: Yeah,
she did that some. Why?

418
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,330
DAVID: Different accents can be like
speaking in tongues.

419
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,546
The pregnancy,
did you tell her about that at all?

420
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,672
ISABELLA: No.

421
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,752
DAVID: And you're absolutely sure

422
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,008
there's no other way
she could have found out?

423
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,182
I mean, there's no way.

424
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:22,057
See, there are basically four factors

425
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,935
when it comes to
determining demonic possession.

426
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,187
One, unnatural strength.

427
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,191
You got aversion to holy objects.

428
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,239
Languages or events
that they could not have known.

429
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,191
And preternatural movement,

430
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,992
which is basically
objects moving around the room.

431
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:46,206
So, strength? No. Languages, no.

432
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:48,959
Preternatural movement, no.
Aversion to holy objects, maybe.

433
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,711
Yeah, but there are accents
and, Ben, she knew that information.

434
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,633
Yeah, that interests me.

435
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,716
We need to show you something.

436
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,720
Okay. Can I bring the camera?

437
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,350
- Sure.
- All right.

438
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,560
Okay.

439
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,071
- Can I bring this?
- Yeah, of course. Come on through.

440
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,985
MICHAEL: I'm good. I'm right behind you.
Keep going.

441
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,243
ISABELLA: What is all this?
Who are these people?

442
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,500
BEN: These are people
the Church turned down for exorcism.

443
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:35,252
- And they're all possessed?
BEN: - We believe they are.

444
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,258
These two cases are resolved.
Those two are open

445
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,756
and we're almost done with this one.

446
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:44,681
This is the girl, Rosa, right?
From the video we saw in Gallo's class?

447
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,387
You both thought she was possessed.

448
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,440
BEN: She is.
We think the Church made a mistake.

449
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,478
So correct me if I'm wrong,

450
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:59,783
but you guys are performing
these exorcisms yourselves,

451
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,202
without the Church's permission?

452
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:06,783
That's right. We have to. Otherwise,
these people would continue to suffer.

453
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,585
What is all that?

454
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,167
DAVID: We monitor everything.
Heart rate, blood pressure.

455
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,418
Yeah, go ahead.

456
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,342
That's a camera we use
to determine pupil dilation,

457
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,091
which is very important
in cases of possession.

458
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:23,432
Nine millimeters
is as large as the average pupil gets.

459
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,596
Maybe 10 or 11
under certain substances

460
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,019
like cocaine, psilocybin,
methamphetamines.

461
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,684
Anything above 11
is considered preternatural.

462
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,683
Why doesn't the Church
help these people?

463
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,063
You see, that's just it.

464
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,941
The Church isn't in the business
of healing people.

465
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:38,530
The bureaucracy won't allow it.

466
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,901
Their hands are tied. In 1999,
the Church changed the exorcism rites

467
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,361
for the first time in almost 400 years.

468
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,321
Now a priest has to be
absolutely certain

469
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,625
that there's an evil presence
in order to even attempt an exorcism.

470
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,373
And that's a near impossible task,
because a lot of the time

471
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,964
it takes an exorcism
for a demon to reveal itself.

DAVID: No, no. Isabella, you...

476
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,012
The Church will never pursue
your mother's case

477
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,844
because the last time someone did,
people died.

What do you suggest?

479
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,689
If you really want to help your mother,

480
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,017
you need a better understanding
of exorcism.

481

A real understanding.

482
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:22,358
Okay. So take more classes
and maybe show Gallo the tape?

483
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:27,618
Isabella, you'll learn more
in five minutes of an exorcism

484
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:30,620
than you will
in three months in some class.

485

Plus, you'll get to know
the real difference

between possession and mental illness.

487

00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,103
what exactly changed?

492
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,740
Well, for one, all media coverage
of exorcisms were banned.

493
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,155
Not that they were filmed much anyway.

494
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,154
