I don't want to speak anymore.

171
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,889
Nobody listens to me.

172
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,618
Nobody.

173
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,594
I'm listening.

174
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,801
And I'll understand you.

175
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,928
Dorothy.

176
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,939
Trust me.

177
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:45,515
So where were you if you
weren't at the Kearsleys'?

178
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,721
I said my prayers,

179
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,848
and I went to bed.

180
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,227
And I woke up in the morning

181
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,663
in my bed.

182
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,828
Do you remember anything else?

183
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,204
I'm sick of all your questions.

184
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,373
Okay.

185
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:20,577
Well, why don't we just
swap places, then?

186
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,552
You ask me questions.

You think she's guilty, don't you?

190
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,838
I'm just doing the first psychological
assessment in this case.

191
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,169
Case?

192
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,301
This case is a child.

193
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,742
And she has suffered enough.

194
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,404
It's up to the court
to decide what happens.

195
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,506
I promise I'll do what's best for her.

Write that out 100 times

and show me in the morning.

203

Now go!

204

So you're the doctor, too?

00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,931
I am.

206
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,470
How long have you
been looking after Dorothy?

207
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,632
Not since she was 13.

208
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,260
Healthy child, isn't she?

209
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:15,026
Here on the island,
we live a clean, healthy life.

Our faith shelters us.

I suppose you just failed to notice
her mental illness?

212
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,542
Dorothy is a special child.

213
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,975
There is a place for her
in our community.

214
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,945
Even if she did molest that baby?

215
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,141
It is the Lord's place to judge, not mine.

216
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,649
I'm not here to judge her, either.

217
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,379
I'm here to help her.

218
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,613
And she can be helped.

219
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:41,824
We have little faith in your science.

220
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:45,488
How can your science
fathom her pure soul?

221
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,499
One of God's angels.

222
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:52,162
An angel that might end up in prison.

223
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,881
They're not really fond
of women in here, are they?

224
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,981
It's a very devout community.

225
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,958
They take their faith very seriously.

226

You're not a believer?

227

Me? No. Jeez.

228
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,094
Had enough of that when I was a kid.

229
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,256
You were born here?

230
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,129
Hmm. And raised.

231
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,637
Tried to escape the place,
but this island is like a magnet.

232
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,070
You can't escape.

233
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,268
There you are.

234
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,579
What is it with white food and this island?

235
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,417
Hey, you've only three days of it.

I have to live here.

Yeah? How'd it go?

239
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,893
I think she's scared to death.

240
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,299
- Scared of who?
- Don't know.

241
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,530
Herself, maybe.

242
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,132
Self-loathing can be a powerful driver.

243
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,075
Don't stare at her too long there, John.

244

You know what these shrinks are like.

When my sister died,

there was no one else to look after her.

309
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,720
So it was natural she stay with me.

310
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,319
What about Dorothy's father?

311
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:28,797
We never knew him.

00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:32,928
Mabel wasn't promiscuous,
you understand?

313
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,972
She was fanciful,

314
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,028
flighty.

315
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,890
She wasn't simple, either,
no matter what the others say.

316
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,755
She just couldn't seem
to hold down a job

317
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,624
until she took the job
in the funeral parlor,

319

She liked that.

But she was a good mother.

321
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,333
And she kept Dorothy safe
from the other children.

322
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:10,374
Do you have any idea why she was
bullied by the other children?

323
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:13,274
Because they hated
anyone or anything

324
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,834
that was different.

325
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,848
God help the child.
She was always different.

326
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,544
Did you ever think
she might be dangerous?

327
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,815
She never laid a hand on that baby.

328
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,287
She swore to me she didn't,

329
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,983
and I believe her.

330
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,754
Why do you want to help me?

331
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,492
Because I've heard
you talk and...

332
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,864
I don't think you're here to help me.

333

I am here to help you.

334

I think I can help you, Dorothy.

335
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,834
You know why?

336

The bastards!

512
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:15,273
Christ. I'm gonna make them pay for this.

513

Come on, lads. Come on.

Come on.

Mrs. Fallon.

520
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:08,395
Mrs. Fallon, I'm Jane Morton.

521
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,330
- I'm here to...
- I know who you are.

522
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,197
I need to speak to your son Jake.

523
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,671
You want to ask him
about that bitch Dorothy Mills?

524
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,039
She's a liar. A slut and a liar.

525
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,640
Why do you call her a slut?

526
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,183
[dogs continue barking]

527
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,216
What's the problem?

528
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,782
What do you want?

529
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,259
Come to gloat?

530
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:40,455
- Paul, calm down.
- Shut up!

531
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,523
You're getting a real kick
out of this, aren't you?

532
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,862
Messin' us around like guinea pigs.

533
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,368
Well, let me tell you something.

534
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,631
This island is no
fucking laboratory, Doctor.

535
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,366
Come on, now, Paul. Drop it.

00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:58,871
Go on.

539
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,984
What the fuck is wrong with you people?

540
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,543
Just go.

541
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,110
Get a grip on yourself, boy.

542
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,840
We didn't do anything wrong.

543
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,245
Not us.

544
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,544
We've nothing to be guilty about.

545
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:39,680
No, sir.

546
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,025
[sighs]

547
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,487
Does nothing work on this bloody island?

548
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,648
- We'll see what we can do tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

549
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,420
It's the Lord's day today.

Go and see in the church.

553
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:35,103
She let the devil into her house.

Once more into the realm of the dead.

560

Please let him talk to me.

Please let him find the peace to talk.

[Dorothy]
Leave her alone!

[screams]

571
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:22,758

[screaming]

574
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:34,066
Let her go
before I fucking kill you!

575
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,367
Please don't!

576
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,374
Leave her alone!

577
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,569
For God's sake.

578
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:44,603
[Dorothy crying]
Please don't. Please.

579
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,615
I shall notify the court in the morning

580
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,880
that Dorothy must be taken
into custody immediately.

581
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:50,977
She's not safe with you.

582
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,352
I'm taking her with me.

583
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:07,801
[no audible dialogue]

584
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:11,265
Aah!

585
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,741
You bitch! Bitch!

586
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,038
All right, Dorothy, calm down.

587
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,842
Oh, hey, it's the fucking sheriff!

588
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:22,017
[screaming]

589
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:24,019
I asked you not to intervene.

590
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,180
Well, next time, I'll tie her up.

591
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,156
My head.

592
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,965
Well, you were kind of asking for it.

593
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,303
Dorothy?

594
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,605
I'm not Dorothy.

595
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:48,803
I'm Kurt.

596
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,238
Well, nice to meet you, Kurt.

597
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:53,407
I'm Jane.

598
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,311
Tell me what I can do to help you.

599
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,356
I always take the pain for her.

600
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,016
For Dorothy.

601
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:06,028
I take the pain so she doesn't get hurt.

602
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,529
She wouldn't handle it.

603
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,326
That's very brave of you.

604
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,390
Yeah, well, I'm getting
a bit bored with it now.

605
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,992
And I don't want to go to jail.

606
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,197
If Dorothy goes to jail,
we'll all go, won't we?

607
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:18,002
Yes.

608
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,407
But you have to help me.

609
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:23,037
Were you there at the Kearsleys'?

610
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,910
- Did you see the baby?
- No, no.

611
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:28,439
I can't talk. Duncan won't let me.

612
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,679
- Who's Duncan?
- Duncan's the boss.

613
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,085
Where is he? Can I talk to him?

614
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:34,680
Trust me, you don't want
anything to do with him.

615
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,350
You, especially. He'd kill you.

616
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,950
Tell Duncan that I want to speak to...

617
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,223
[whimpering]

618
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,663
Come back here, bastard!

619
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:44,666
Bastard! Shut it!

620
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,998
[wailing]
Hold her down for me.

621
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,504
[continues wailing]

622
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,006
Dorothy.

623
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,200
[screaming]

624
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,436
[crying]
No.

625
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,540
I killed the baby, didn't I?

626
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,344
Tell me. Tell me, please.

627
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,351
- Dorothy?
- What are you doing? No.

628
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:03,545
- I promise...
- Stop it.

629
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,589
- I promise it won't hurt.
- Stop it!

630
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:08,647
We should take her home.

631
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,321
I gave her a tranquilizer.

632
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:17,559
She'll sleep until tomorrow morning.

633
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,608
I'll be here before she wakes up.

634
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,793
You were very impressive back there.

635
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,332
Thanks.

636
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,960
But you should've got
that ferry this morning.

637
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,129
You know, people
are getting nervous around here.

638
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:56,172
You're unsettling them.

639
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,797
I'm unsettling them?

640
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,739
You've had time to gather
your material, you know?

641
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:02,869
You can write
your report now, can't you?

642
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,744
Well, maybe there's more
at stake than just a report.

643
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:07,180
Look, I've a small boat.

644
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,844
I could easily take you to the mainland.

645
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,115
I can't leave without Dorothy.

646
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,248
Well, the next ferry isn't for three days.

647
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:17,953
Well, then, I'll just have to wait for it.

648
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,326
See you later.

649
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,659
Jakey.

650
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,497
Hey, gorgeous.

651
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,006
Want to party?

652
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,666
Dorothy, you shouldn't be out here...

653
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:06,731
Shut up.

654
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,975
You drive.

655
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:27,986
Come on.

656
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,567
Come on.

657
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,805
Come on.

658
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:43,607
Come on. Come on.

659
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:52,988
You really think
I was gonna let a pinhead like you

660
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:54,614
jerk off inside me?

661
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,819
You're a funny boy, Jakey, aren't you?

662
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,384
Can't resist.

663
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:03,660
I'm desperate,
but I'm not that desperate.

664
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,702
[laughing]

665
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:13,865
You twisted slut. I'll fucking kill you!

666
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,638
You slag!

667
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:18,613
You fucking dirt box!

Hello?

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Dr. Norton?</i>

Yes, it's me. Who's speaking?

<i>Dorothy tried to kill herself.</i>

<i>Dorothy needs you. Come quickly.</i>

Dorothy!

00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,264
Why, you must be freezing.

683
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,933
I'm not Dorothy. I'm Kurt.

684
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,204
What happened, Kurt?

685
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,075
When you put Dorothy to bed,

686
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:34,014
Mary took over
and escaped out the window.

687
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,108
What did she do?

688
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,313
The usual tricks.

689
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,117
She got arsed with some bloke,

690
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:43,648
and then vanished
when things got out of hand.

691
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:48,060
Dorothy was so close
to throwing herself off that cliff.

692
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,258
If I hadn't been there to save her...

693
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:51,960
Good man, Kurt.

694
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:54,094
Dorothy will be very proud of you.

695
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,974
Oh, sweetheart, I'm here.
It's all right now.

696
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:01,840
I'm taking you home.

697
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:03,902
What sort of drug did you give her?

No, no, you're not dead.

00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:05,130
But I saw the cliff.

703
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,573
I remember the cliff.

704
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,668
I fell off the cliff. I saw the waves.

705
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,337
Shh. You're safe now. It's okay.

706
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:12,540
No, but I'm a freak.

Nobody can help a freak!

You're not a freak, Dorothy, okay?

709
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:18,243
I've done horrible things
I don't even remember.

Listen, Dorothy. Listen carefully to me.

The things that are happening inside of you
are not your fault.

These blackouts that you have,

715
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,369
they're caused
by different characters

716

that you've created in your mind.

717
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,768
And when you're scared,
just like now,

718
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:46,246
your... your mind sends out
a character to protect you.

719
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:49,012
But I don't remember anything.

720

No, but it's because...

721
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,382
it's because you...

722
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,288
- Dorothy.
- No.

723
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:59,157
It's because...

724
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:02,163
you disappear when that happens.

No. No.

728
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,668
Dorothy, they're trying to keep you

729
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,540
- from killing yourself.
- It isn't true.

730

Dorothy, it was one of these characters

01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:20,547
that hurt this baby, Dorothy, not you.

You mustn't be afraid of them.

Listen, you must try
to relate to them.

Duncan, is that you?

Did you hurt the baby?

Do you think I hurt the baby?

- Why did you do it?
- How can I do anything?

Why did you do it?

Payback.

743
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,170
Just a little bit of payback.

01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:52,009
What could a baby
have done against you?

If I can prove this is a case

I thought I'd never see her again.

But the good Lord brought Dorothy
into my home as a gift.

864

She's worked miracles for me.

She's made your son

I've seen death
cast its wings on you.

What is it, Dorothy?

876
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:20,608
Is it the water?

- And the blood?
- I'm scared.

It's okay.

You've gone through it once.

And you can live it
again through memory.

I want to take you

This is getting out of hand, lad.

You...

You killed my daughter.

01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:15,988
You killed my daughter!

1036
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:18,184
Kurt. My Kurt.

1037
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:20,318
We were just young and stupid!

1038
01:28:20,395 --> 01:28:21,657
We didn't mean...

1039

Mary McMahon was up for it!

Oh...

1048
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:58,456
you bunch of hypocrites.

1049
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:00,967
You didn't bat an eye
when we took her away, did you?

1050
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:02,024
Hmm?

1051
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:04,805
You all thought she deserved it.

1052
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:07,033
Didn't you!

1053
01:29:10,044 --> 01:29:11,875
We're all in this together.

1054
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:13,345
Together.

1055
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:20,446
We can keep this on the island.

1056
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:23,948
- She's the only evidence.
- Dorothy!

Please! Please, don't touch her!

1058

You leave her alone! Please!

1059
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:30,954
- Hush, woman!
- Don't touch her!

1060
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:32,727
Think about it now.

1061
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:37,260
Huh? Do you really want
all the publicity?

1062
01:29:37,338 --> 01:29:38,600
Hmm?

1063
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:40,937
Policemen?

1064
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:42,202
Journalists?

1065
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:43,766
Huh?

1066
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:47,576
All poking their noses
all around this island?

1067
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:49,513
Our island?

1068
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:56,315
It'll be the end
of your happy little community.

1069
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:05,296
Huh? Think about that now.

1070
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:15,103
She's the only evidence.

1071
01:30:18,846 --> 01:30:19,870
You leave her alone!

1072
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:21,107
[roaring]

1073
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:25,811
[Pastor]
This is a time of tribulation.

1074
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:29,441
Fear and anger

1075
01:31:29,517 --> 01:31:33,078
threaten to drive apart
those who have lived in fellowship

1076
01:31:33,154 --> 01:31:35,213
for many, many years.

1077
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:39,984
We cannot let this pass.

1078
01:31:41,796 --> 01:31:45,562
For the sake
of the island, we must act.

1079
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:48,033
We must right this wrong.

1080
01:31:48,102 --> 01:31:51,162
[sobbing]

1081
01:31:52,874 --> 01:31:55,399
We will not hand you to the police.

1082
01:31:57,078 --> 01:31:59,638
But you cannot stay here.

1083
01:31:59,714 --> 01:32:02,842
You will be exiled
from this place forever,

1084
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:04,908
you and your families.

1085
01:32:05,987 --> 01:32:08,717
Your homes will be leveled.

1086
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:11,587
All memory of you will be erased.

1087
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:18,223
If any man should disagree with this,

1088
01:32:18,299 --> 01:32:20,130
let him speak now.

1089
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:30,907
We have all sinned.

1090
01:32:30,978 --> 01:32:34,311
And we shall all suffer.

1091
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:38,182
So let us now devote ourself

1092
01:32:38,252 --> 01:32:41,278
to the worship of the Lord our God,

1093
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:45,689
in the hope of redeeming
ourselves in His eyes.

1094
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:51,592
As for the psychiatrist,

1095
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:53,861
it was her own stubbornness

1096
01:32:53,935 --> 01:32:56,995
and refusal to listen to reason

1097
01:32:57,071 --> 01:33:00,472
which brought her to tragedy.

1098
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:03,408
Suffice to say

1099
01:33:03,477 --> 01:33:08,107
she left us without word
of her destination.

1100
01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:59,431
No.
[gasps]

1101
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:02,594
No. It's not possible.

1102
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:06,238
I'm dead?

1103
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:07,467
I'm so sorry, Jane.

1104
01:34:09,844 --> 01:34:12,176
It's all my fault.

1105
01:34:12,246 --> 01:34:14,407
I should've stopped you
from going on that damned island.

1106
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:15,471
I feel so guilty.

1107
01:34:15,549 --> 01:34:17,210
Don't say that.
[sniffles]

1108
01:34:18,352 --> 01:34:20,445
I'm happy you sent me.

1109
01:34:22,523 --> 01:34:25,788
I couldn't save David, you see.

1110
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,452
But at least I saved Dorothy.

1111
01:34:27,528 --> 01:34:29,291
[sniffles]

1112
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:31,331
I saved her, didn't I?

1113
01:34:32,867 --> 01:34:34,596
You saved her.

1114
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:37,799
You brought her back to me.

1115
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:41,398
She'll be acquitted,

1116
01:34:41,475 --> 01:34:44,444
and she'll stay here
until she's cured.

1117
01:34:47,715 --> 01:34:49,239
Yeah.

1118
01:34:53,054 --> 01:34:54,817
And now it's up to you, Jane.

1119
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:59,619
You have to leave Dorothy's body.

1120
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:02,219
She won't be free until you're gone.

1121
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,764
Will you take good care of her?

1122
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:16,537
I promise.

1123
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:32,617
Keep it.
[sniffles]

1124
01:35:32,693 --> 01:35:34,684
David loved you so much.

1125
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:39,556
I'll keep it forever.

1126
01:35:43,537 --> 01:35:47,268
Good-bye, my love.

Dorothy?

1130
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:24,004
Is that you?

1131
01:36:34,688 --> 01:36:37,452
[Dorothy]
Has Jane been crying?

1132
01:36:37,525 --> 01:36:39,220
She was here.

1133
01:36:42,363 --> 01:36:44,092
She's gone now.

1134
01:36:47,868 --> 01:36:52,168
She's with her son... David.

1135
01:36:54,542 --> 01:36:56,806
Do you think they're all gone?

1136
01:36:59,046 --> 01:37:01,981
Duncan and Kurt

1137
01:37:02,049 --> 01:37:03,812
and Mary?

1138
01:37:03,884 --> 01:37:06,182
And Mimi, too?

1139
01:37:06,253 --> 01:37:09,347
You have to learn to live
on your own now, Dorothy.

1140
01:37:23,204 --> 01:37:24,637
You're free.
