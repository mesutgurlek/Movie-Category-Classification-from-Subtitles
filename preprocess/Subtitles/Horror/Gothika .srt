1
00:00:53,336 --> 00:00:58,569
He came back again last night
and tore me like paper.

2
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:03,376
He opened me like a flower of pain...

3
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,140
...and it felt good.

4
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:11,650
He sank into me and set me on fire...

5
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,018
...like he always does.

6
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:19,355
Made me burn from the inside out.

7
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,328
How did you know it was the devil?

8
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:28,093
I know what you're thinking.

9
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:32,230
I know you think
I'm talking about my stepfather...

10
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:34,842
...because you don't believe in the devil.

11
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:38,478
Okay, let's talk about your stepfather.

12
00:01:38,648 --> 00:01:44,245
You know about my stepfather.
You know I cut his throat.

13
00:01:44,554 --> 00:01:48,388
I cut his Adam's apple in half...

14
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:52,654
...like a piece of fruit on a summer day...

15
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,730
...so he wouldn't say a word.

16
00:01:56,166 --> 00:02:00,296
I sat next to him
and watched him die...

17
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,667
...slowly.

18
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:10,207
It was the only way to help him stop.

19
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,473
Stop what?

20
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,711
Stop fucking me!

21
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:21,585
You're not listening.

22
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:25,922
I am listening, Chloe.

23
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:31,260
You're not listening with your heart.
Just your brain.

24
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:34,602
Your brain is the problem.

25
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:40,776
You have no idea
how it feels not to be trusted.

26
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:44,209
You've got to trust me too, Chloe.

27
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:50,209
You can't trust someone
who thinks you're crazy.

28
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:58,020
Okay. I think that's enough for today.

29
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:03,729
But I do think we made
some really good headway...

30
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,731
...found out some new things...

31
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:09,531
Do you know what it is
to burn from the inside?

32
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:12,573
- Do you know? Because you are dead!
- Let her go, Chloe.

33
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:17,270
I am. I'm not touching her!
I'm not touching her! Let me go!

34
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:19,811
Let me go! Let me go.

35
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:31,726
Thank you.

36
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:40,862
You're driving me crazy! Stop!

37
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:42,561
- Stop it!
- Let go!

38
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,639
Stop it!

39
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,305
I can walk by myself!

40
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,011
Stand up!

41
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:54,879
Look at that.

42
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:57,281
"I'm a doctor. "

43
00:03:57,453 --> 00:04:01,583
"Open this door. "
Hey, you are dead!

44
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:03,487
Get in.

45
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:06,251
She's nuts.

46
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:07,255
Hey.

47
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,986
Sorry.

48
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:13,390
I need to cross-reference some files
with you on Monday. How's your morning?

49
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,727
- Check with Anna. She'll fit you in.
- Thanks. Sorry.

50
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:25,697
I'm not discharging her, period.

51
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:30,471
If you want to pursue this, sir,
have a judge order her transfer.

52
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:33,206
Until then she's mine.

53
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,384
Thank you.

54
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:36,813
Lawyers.

55
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:40,387
Hey, come on in.

56
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:42,820
What's up?

57
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:45,426
Chloe. She's embellishing
her rape story again.

58
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,497
She says that the devil
is visiting her in her cell.

59
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:52,634
- Okay.
- Well, it's the third time in three months.

60
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:56,101
It has something to do with
her stepfather, possibly remorse...

61
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,298
...but instead of assessing
the memory and accepting it...

62
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:05,277
...she just falls into these
satanic meanderings.

63
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,473
Time. Give it time.

64
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,984
I've given it time. Time and Elavil.
And Mellaril and Haldol.

65
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:15,124
Maybe they're just...

66
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,815
...too medicated.

67
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:21,158
I know we all create our realities
to some extent. Yes, true.

68
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,767
But what she creates
is so far from any objective reality...

69
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:29,329
Chloe's mind only runs on one track.

70
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,305
Well, right now,
my mind is running on empty.

71
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:38,475
Come here.

72
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:47,418
You have a brilliant mind.

73
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,388
You'll figure it out.

74
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,096
Throw it on the mirror.

75
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:01,733
This is what she sees now.

76
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:07,104
- A distorted image of herself.
- Who are you in all this?

77
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,344
- I'm the mirror.
- You are the mirror.

78
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,474
If I'm the mirror and she's the image...

79
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,784
...then who are you?

80
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:22,652
I can see both of you...

81
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:25,293
...so I'm God.

82
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:29,062
Or just an overworked hospital bureaucrat.

83
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:31,530
"God" is good.

84
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:38,874
Always remember, the ability to repress...

85
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:44,138
...is actually a vital survival tool.
Without it...

86
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:47,578
...Chloe might not have survived.

87
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,894
Sorry, am I interrupting
the happy couple?

88
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:06,768
Dr. Graham. We were just discussing
repression as a survival mechanism.

89
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:11,373
Oh, yeah, I had a date last week.
I barely survived it. I'm trying to forget it.

90
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:16,035
I'm sure your amorous adventures
are fascinating, doctor...

91
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:19,375
...but sadly, I'm on my way out.

92
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:22,814
- Well, don't let me... I'll just...
- No, no, no, I'm leaving.

93
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:26,318
I'm gonna run out to Willow Creek.
Meet the new contractor.

94
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:29,754
I'll be here. See you at dinner.

95
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:33,828
Keep an eye on my wife for me, Pete.
I know you will. Here.

96
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:38,592
- No, thanks.
- No, let me circumcise it for you.

97
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,862
Smoke it tonight while it's fresh.

98
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:47,840
- Good night, boss.
- Good night, kids.

99
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,280
Why don't we share one of those
golden-crust, cheese-filled specials.

100
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,579
- It sounds like a great offer...
- Here's the file.

101
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:01,086
...but I got work to do.
- I'm buying.

102
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,953
- It's cold when it gets here.
- We could warm it up.

103
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,117
- I hate pizza.
- Who doesn't like pizza?

104
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,263
Come on, you gotta eat.

105
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,490
Not with you.

106
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:15,897
Come on, we're supposed to celebrate.
I just got circumcised...

107
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:24,405
- Who's inside?
- We have Shelley for observation.

108
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,038
- Why? What happened?
- She had another attack.

109
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:32,347
- What'd you do, up her meds?
- Yeah, 25 milligrams.

110
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:35,718
That's extreme.
That dose is way too high.

111
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:38,485
I want a copy of that on my desk
by Monday, okay?

112
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,391
- Okay.
- Thank you.

113
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,934
Damn generator.

114
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:23,462
Not again.

115
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:27,174
Irene, is that you?

116
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:30,677
This electric system's
gonna give us trouble.

117
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:33,337
Fourth time this week.
I'm going for my swim.

118
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:37,452
Well, I'm gonna do my job,
as long as these damn lights stay on.

119
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,716
- Good night, Joe.
- Hey, how many laps, doc?

120
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:18,325
Fifty-five, but who's counting?

121
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:22,430
Oh, you've outdone yourself.
Hey, safe drive home.

122
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:27,035
- Thank you. Say hi to your wife for me.
- Will do.

123
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:50,153
All that education
but you can't remember an umbrella.

124
00:11:50,326 --> 00:11:53,853
- Did you get my note?
- Yeah, I got your note. Your business note.

125
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:57,294
Right. So how was your date with...?

126
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:03,234
With what's-her-name? It was like all
of my dates. It was brief. It was pointless.

127
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:06,773
She didn't respond to my
sense of humor, my boyish good looks...

128
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:08,807
...so I started talking about work.

129
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,414
She said that was not
a suitable topic for a first date...

130
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:15,982
...and that was it.
I mean, it was just drinks, you know.

131
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,347
I mean, we didn't even have dinner.

132
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:21,046
She's not right.
When you know, you know.

133
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:23,191
I know.

134
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,322
- I'll follow you down the hill.
- You don't have to.

135
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:32,490
- No, I'm supposed to keep an eye on you.
- Since when did you ever listen to the boss?

136
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:23,209
<i>Severe showers all over northern
Connecticut and New Hampshire.</i>

137
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,479
<i>- I know, I see that.
- rain in Lennox County...</i>

138
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:37,225
<i>- flooding throughout
Lennox County and closure...</i>

139
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,571
- I can't let you through. The road's closed.
- What's going on?

140
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,643
- I got this.
- There's a sinkhole.

141
00:13:49,812 --> 00:13:52,508
- Hi, Bob.
- You picked a hell of a night for a drive.

142
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:56,546
There's a sinkhole up here,
you can't get through. Sorry.

143
00:13:56,719 --> 00:14:00,155
- What should I do?
- Go a quarter of a mile down, take a left...

144
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:02,654
You know that bridge
that Doug and I fish at?

145
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:05,157
- Yeah, the little white one?
- That's the one.

146
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:06,988
- Yeah.
- You can go across there.

147
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:09,722
- Okay, thanks.
- Hey, tell Doug to give me a call.

148
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,890
Will do.

149
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:27,675
<i>- Doug, you're home?
- Yeah, where are you?</i>

150
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,617
I got detoured, so I'll be home in a few
minutes, okay? How was Willow Creek?

151
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,484
<i>This rain is slowing the work down.
It's a big mess.</i>

152
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:38,252
<i>- Are you okay?
- Yeah.</i>

153
00:14:39,728 --> 00:14:41,593
Doug.

154
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,592
Doug!

155
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,497
Are you okay?

156
00:15:20,402 --> 00:15:22,734
Are you okay?

157
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:26,736
Hey!

158
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,116
Oh, my God. Okay. Okay. Okay.

159
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:47,061
I'm a doctor. I'm gonna take you
to the hospital. I'm a doctor, honey.

160
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:50,858
I'm gonna help you, okay?
You're gonna be okay.

161
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,194
I'm gonna help you, okay?

162
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,792
Help me!

163
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:29,199
Somebody!

164
00:16:36,712 --> 00:16:38,179
Dr. Graham!

165
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,315
You better tell me why I'm in here, Irene.

166
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:44,008
She got up wild.

167
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:48,122
- Bring your ass back in here.
- Give me 40 milligrams of Ativan.

168
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,884
- Get your hands off me.
- Stay in the cell.

169
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,789
- Keep her off.
- Restrain her.

170
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:57,728
Keep her off of me. Get off of me.
Do you hear me? Get off of me.

171
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,027
Hold on. Calm...

172
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:03,933
What are you doing?
What are you doing to me?

173
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,403
Thank you, nurse.

174
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:12,575
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, she calmed down.

175
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:15,273
This is so sad.

176
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:19,886
Miranda, this is very awkward.

177
00:17:20,055 --> 00:17:23,286
I suppose that technically
I shouldn't even be treating you...

178
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,657
...but I managed to get the court to grant us
a waiver until you're transferred.

179
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,298
Anything we discuss
is in strict confidence...

180
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,559
...and won't go anywhere but this room.

181
00:17:35,237 --> 00:17:37,364
How long have I been in here?

182
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,373
Three days.

183
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,611
Why? Why?

184
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:48,079
You were admitted to our neurosurgical
unit, you were seizing violently.

185
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:52,209
We did scans and they revealed
left-sided weakness, numbness...

186
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:54,617
...severe frontal-lobe deficits.

187
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,486
You received Haloperidol, Ativan injections.

188
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,186
When you came out of it, we tested.
You were negative for PCP.

189
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:06,296
But you were put in restraints for a day
and a half so you wouldn't injure yourself.

190
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:11,265
And then you basically
went into a state of catatonia.

191
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:14,740
This is the first time I've seen you lucid.

192
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:19,445
I wanna talk to my husband.

193
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:22,550
Where is he? Where is he?

194
00:18:22,718 --> 00:18:26,017
You know, you're the most
logical person I know, bar none.

195
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:30,150
You rely only on the facts.

196
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:33,917
So why am I telling you this?

197
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:38,194
You're establishing my personality.

198
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:42,463
You think I'm a rational person.
You don't think I'm impulsive or emotional.

199
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:46,267
And following this pattern of analysis,
we are about to discuss...

200
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:50,844
...a traumatic event which has rendered
this psychological profile useless.

201
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:55,211
- You think I'm in denial.
- Don't analyze yourself...

202
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,114
...just focus on remembering.

203
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,417
Miranda...

204
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:06,584
...what's the last thing you remember?

205
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:15,827
I remember Chloe.

206
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:19,829
I was having my Friday night
session with Chloe.

207
00:19:20,008 --> 00:19:21,669
How did that go?

208
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,546
She was embellishing her rape story.

209
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,450
- I saw Doug.
- Dr. Graham.

210
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:33,081
You were there.

211
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:40,284
When I went back to my office,
I worked on Chloe's file.

212
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:45,058
I decided to call it quits, I went down
to the pool, had a swim, 55 laps...

213
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:49,967
...saw Joe, got my keys.
Went to my car. You walked me to it.

214
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:53,903
- Yes.
- But...

215
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:56,408
- There was a detour.
- Oh, hey, tell Doug...

216
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,942
I had to go over the bridge,
so I went over the bridge.

217
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:12,955
I wonder what else happened.
Try to remember.

218
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:17,722
I got home.

219
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:25,237
I saw Doug. He was on the couch.

220
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,145
Try to remember.

221
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,984
There was a girl.

222
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,517
- Yeah, there was a girl.
- No, there was no...

223
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:49,186
Yeah, there was a girl.

224
00:20:49,364 --> 00:20:51,628
- A girl at the bridge.
- There was no report...

225
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,030
- There was some kind of accident.
- No.

226
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:57,797
- The girl was bloody. On the bridge...
- I want to ask you about Doug.

227
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,099
What's the last thing you remember?

228
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:03,733
Why are you asking about Doug?
I'm telling you about a girl I saw.

229
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:05,971
Was there any trouble in your marriage?

230
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:09,076
No, there was no trouble in my marriage.

231
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:12,049
And why are you using
the past tense of the word?

232
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,847
Miranda...

233
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:18,516
...you don't remember anything
about Doug? Anything at all?

234
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,855
Don't tell me something's
wrong with Doug.

235
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,896
I have to tell you something.
Something very difficult.

236
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:25,761
No, no, no...

237
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:30,501
- Don't tell me there's something with Doug.
- Miranda...

238
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:33,805
...Doug is dead.

239
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:37,336
You killed him.

240
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:42,181
- No! No! No!
- Orderly!

241
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:44,876
I didn't.

242
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:48,022
- No, I didn't.
- Orderly!

243
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,921
I didn't! I didn't do it! No!

244
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:57,356
No! No! No, don't do it!

245
00:21:57,532 --> 00:22:01,434
- It's okay.
- I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

246
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:03,503
I'm on your side.

247
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:05,867
I'm on your side.

248
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,315
One little bit more.

249
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:07,095
Rita. Let go.

250
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:09,836
It's Dr. Grey.

251
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,968
Look it up. Don't look at me like that.

252
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:27,779
I'm the official champion again.

253
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:37,291
Hello, Miranda. Welcome.

254
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:42,134
You're one of us now.

255
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:46,402
You know I don't belong here, Chloe.

256
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:49,738
If you're here,
it must mean that you belong.

257
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:52,505
You are not a doctor in here.

258
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,946
And even if you tell the truth...

259
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:58,985
...no one will listen.

260
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:02,351
You know why? Because you're crazy.

261
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:09,991
And the more you try
to prove them wrong...

262
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:13,396
...the crazier you appear.

263
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,736
You are invisible now.

264
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,029
Can you feel it?

265
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:31,349
Don't touch me.

266
00:24:32,187 --> 00:24:33,711
Are you scared?

267
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,849
No.

268
00:24:36,024 --> 00:24:38,151
You should be.

269
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:03,529
I'm dreaming.

270
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:06,866
I'm dreaming.

271
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,876
Dream logic, primary process,
that's what this is.

272
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,946
I'm dreaming.

273
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:17,346
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.

274
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,511
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming.

275
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:24,420
I'm not crazy. I'm dreaming.

276
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:31,426
Rise and shine, honey. It's a new day.

277
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:37,863
I wanna talk to Pete.

278
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:42,499
You'll see Dr. Graham all in good time,
but now I want you to have some breakfast.

279
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:49,213
- Why are you doing this to me, Irene?
- I'm just doing my job.

280
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:53,584
You don't want me to get Jim
to help me, now do you?

281
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:11,064
Good girl. You're doing good.

282
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:14,675
Come on, sweetheart,
now it's time for a shower.

283
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:31,284
Come on, honey,
time to wash away your sins.

284
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,245
<i>You're a nut.</i>

285
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:37,619
<i>Yeah, it's you. You.</i>

286
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:05,749
<i>Get away. Get away.</i>

287
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:13,387
What's your problem?

288
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:15,995
What's your problem?

289
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,524
I looked away for a second.
It's unacceptable.

290
00:30:48,696 --> 00:30:50,288
It's not your fault.

291
00:30:50,465 --> 00:30:54,925
Patients always find a way to hurt
themselves, if that's what they want.

292
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,197
I never pegged her for a cutter, that's all.

293
00:30:58,373 --> 00:31:00,204
Neither did I.

294
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,900
Shelley says Chloe's
been threatening Miranda...

295
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:06,205
...so I put her in isolation for the day.

296
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:07,848
How is she?

297
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:09,813
She's a mess.

298
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:14,148
I can't believe she's lost it so quickly.
I've never seen that before.

299
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:17,621
She cut herself 35 times,
a lot of blood, but it's superficial.

300
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,317
- What was the implement?
- Probably a scalpel...

301
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:23,396
...though how anybody
got it in there, I have no idea.

302
00:31:32,438 --> 00:31:35,202
Hey, Tony. We're fine.

303
00:31:51,357 --> 00:31:52,619
Come on.

304
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:56,057
You think I did this
to myself, don't you?

305
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:01,964
Did you?

306
00:32:05,905 --> 00:32:07,964
No.

307
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,869
Well, I don't know.

308
00:32:11,044 --> 00:32:13,808
Who would it be, then? Would it be...

309
00:32:14,247 --> 00:32:16,647
...Chloe, or...?

310
00:32:18,151 --> 00:32:20,278
I don't know.

311
00:32:23,189 --> 00:32:25,453
By your own admission
you have difficulty...

312
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:30,927
...distinguishing what's reality
from fantasy, so is it possible?

313
00:32:31,097 --> 00:32:35,227
Yeah, as a doctor,
I understand why you think that.

314
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:39,633
But something is really happening to me.

315
00:32:42,108 --> 00:32:46,204
What about this moment, right now?

316
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:50,046
What about it?

317
00:32:50,216 --> 00:32:52,411
Is this a hallucination?

318
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,715
Is it?

319
00:33:00,626 --> 00:33:05,427
I suggest that we simply
increase the medication...

320
00:33:05,598 --> 00:33:07,259
...until things make sense.

321
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:10,596
Or maybe until I can get myself
a new doctor.

322
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,601
Pardon?

323
00:33:12,772 --> 00:33:16,435
Since I'm hallucinating
and I can't seem to remember things...

324
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:18,577
...you can help me with something.

325
00:33:18,778 --> 00:33:20,837
Yeah. Inhale.

326
00:33:21,447 --> 00:33:23,847
Did we have an affair?

327
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:34,288
No.

328
00:33:35,394 --> 00:33:37,521
Did you want to?

329
00:33:39,732 --> 00:33:41,597
Yes.

330
00:33:42,468 --> 00:33:45,232
Did you think I wanted to?

331
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:48,303
Yes.

332
00:33:49,642 --> 00:33:51,837
Then why didn't we?

333
00:33:54,547 --> 00:33:57,641
Because you were married to the boss.

334
00:34:03,222 --> 00:34:05,554
But I'm not now.

335
00:34:08,361 --> 00:34:10,352
I'm here... I'm...

336
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,764
I'm trying to help you.

337
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:16,998
Why don't you trust me?

338
00:34:18,604 --> 00:34:23,041
Because you can't trust somebody
when they think you're crazy.

339
00:34:50,102 --> 00:34:51,535
Phil.

340
00:34:51,704 --> 00:34:53,865
Hello, Miranda.

341
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,633
I need to talk to you for a minute.

342
00:34:57,143 --> 00:34:59,475
This is about Pete.

343
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:06,481
What about him, Miranda?

344
00:35:06,652 --> 00:35:09,780
I don't think he's the best doctor
to be treating me.

345
00:35:10,623 --> 00:35:13,456
Is your complaint about him
on a personal level?

346
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:19,088
Pete's the best doctor
I have on my staff now.

347
00:35:19,265 --> 00:35:21,699
And he has my full support.

348
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:24,369
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miranda.

349
00:35:51,364 --> 00:35:53,832
- Miranda.
- Hi, Teddy.

350
00:35:59,405 --> 00:36:02,169
- How are they treating you?
- Like I'm crazy, Teddy.

351
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:05,708
- They think I did it, but I didn't do it.
- All right. Thank you.

352
00:36:05,878 --> 00:36:09,370
- I didn't do it, Teddy.
- Have a seat.

353
00:36:11,617 --> 00:36:13,448
Let's not...

354
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:16,884
Let's not talk about what you did
or didn't do, all right?

355
00:36:17,056 --> 00:36:20,822
What's important is what
I can do for you now.

356
00:36:20,993 --> 00:36:26,795
Now, the DA is pushing for a hearing
as early as next week.

357
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:31,630
Next week? We haven't even
had time to investigate.

358
00:36:31,804 --> 00:36:33,601
We can't have a hearing next week.

359
00:36:33,773 --> 00:36:38,972
As your attorney, I gotta tell you
the evidence is overwhelming.

360
00:36:39,145 --> 00:36:42,842
You've been placed at the scene.
The sheriff saw you driving home.

361
00:36:43,015 --> 00:36:44,812
The neighbors heard the screams.

362
00:36:44,984 --> 00:36:47,851
They've got the murder weapon
with your prints on it.

363
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,511
Your prints are on the floor,
walls, everything.

364
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,682
Yeah, but what's my motive?
I don't have a motive, Teddy.

365
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:58,159
Why would I do that?
Maybe one of his ex-patients came.

366
00:36:58,331 --> 00:37:01,027
Has anybody checked the files?
Has anybody escaped?

367
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,658
That person would have a motive.
I was there, and I would scream.

368
00:37:04,837 --> 00:37:07,965
- Maybe I went into shock.
- Miranda.

369
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,132
The only shot we have
is to plead temporary insanity.

370
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:16,007
And I don't even know if that's gonna work.
You're a brilliant psychiatrist.

371
00:37:16,182 --> 00:37:19,515
That will make jurors think
"If she wanted to kill somebody...

372
00:37:19,685 --> 00:37:23,177
...she could probably fake insanity
and get away with it. "

373
00:37:23,356 --> 00:37:24,687
I'm not crazy.

374
00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:27,189
- That's the point.
- No, the point is...

375
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,195
...I'm the only one around here
that believes I didn't kill my husband!

376
00:37:38,404 --> 00:37:40,497
Do you think I'm crazy?

377
00:37:44,176 --> 00:37:46,303
That's all right. Forget it.

378
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:48,709
Forget it.

379
00:37:56,956 --> 00:37:59,390
Sheriff Ryan is here.

380
00:37:59,558 --> 00:38:01,617
He'd like to talk to you.

381
00:38:01,794 --> 00:38:06,731
You know he was Doug's best friend,
so I'd advise against it.

382
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:12,360
It's fine, Teddy.
I don't have anything to hide.

383
00:38:31,524 --> 00:38:33,458
<i>Five minutes.</i>

384
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,697
Hi, Bob.

385
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:42,690
Miranda.

386
00:38:44,437 --> 00:38:49,306
I just have a few questions
that we need to clear up.

387
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:54,176
When you first came in
and he was sitting on the couch...

388
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,043
...the way we reconstruct the crime is that
the first blow came from in front of him.

389
00:39:00,686 --> 00:39:03,746
Which means he must have seen it coming.

390
00:39:04,356 --> 00:39:07,792
And what we don't understand is how he...

391
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:11,056
- Why did you do it?
- Sheriff.

392
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,858
How could you kill Doug like that?
He loved you.

393
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:19,027
- That's the only question I need answered.
- You don't have to answer any questions.

394
00:39:19,205 --> 00:39:22,072
I don't have any answers
to the questions, Bob.

395
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:26,905
You don't? You better start thinking of some
answers, because you're in some trouble.

396
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:29,775
- Sheriff, that's enough. That's enough!
- No, no, no.

397
00:39:29,949 --> 00:39:32,383
I need her to tell me why she did it.

398
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:34,746
Okay, we're done. Enough!

399
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,081
Let's kill your friend, see how you feel!

400
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:40,748
- You said no shock treatment.
- Here's some shock treatment!

401
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:43,986
- Stop it. Why would you take these out?
- Don't look.

402
00:39:44,163 --> 00:39:45,460
Don't look at them.

403
00:39:45,631 --> 00:39:49,931
I had to pick him up off the floor, Miranda.
In pieces!

404
00:39:57,743 --> 00:40:00,075
Miranda, what's that?

405
00:40:27,373 --> 00:40:29,864
It's okay. It's okay, Miranda.

406
00:40:30,176 --> 00:40:33,771
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Miranda, let's just go. We're done.

407
00:40:33,946 --> 00:40:36,244
- Why are you doing this to me?
- It's okay.

408
00:40:36,415 --> 00:40:39,350
- Why are you doing this to me?
- It's okay.

409
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:44,820
Why are you doing this to me?
Why are you doing this to me?!

410
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:53,647
Come in, Miranda.

411
00:42:56,055 --> 00:42:58,114
Please, take a seat.

412
00:43:04,563 --> 00:43:05,996
So...

413
00:43:06,398 --> 00:43:08,525
You wanted to see me.

414
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:13,463
I was there.

415
00:43:16,442 --> 00:43:19,104
I was there when Doug was killed.

416
00:43:21,814 --> 00:43:25,215
But I wasn't alone.

417
00:43:25,517 --> 00:43:28,816
I wasn't there alone,
and that's what "not alone" means.

418
00:43:29,321 --> 00:43:31,983
- Who was there with you?
- I don't know who it was.

419
00:43:32,157 --> 00:43:35,024
I don't know. I don't know who it was.

420
00:43:35,194 --> 00:43:37,059
But somebody else was there.

421
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:42,224
Miranda.

422
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:45,663
We know you have no family left.

423
00:43:46,004 --> 00:43:48,302
We are your family now.

424
00:43:48,474 --> 00:43:52,171
I know. I know you...
I know.

425
00:43:53,645 --> 00:43:57,741
I want you to know that we're gonna
do everything we possibly can...

426
00:43:57,916 --> 00:44:01,716
...to help you and to make you feel secure.

427
00:44:01,887 --> 00:44:06,722
And to make you feel
that you can trust us here.

428
00:44:08,894 --> 00:44:11,727
But there's a hearing scheduled.

429
00:44:11,897 --> 00:44:15,025
- Miranda. Sit down.
- Just... Come on, sit down.

430
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:17,802
Miranda.

431
00:44:31,216 --> 00:44:33,241
Who is this girl?

432
00:44:33,419 --> 00:44:36,217
- Put the picture back.
- Who is this girl?

433
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:39,120
That's my daughter, Rachel.

434
00:44:40,692 --> 00:44:45,527
No, this is the girl I saw at the bridge.
This is the girl.

435
00:44:45,697 --> 00:44:47,722
- No.
- How is she? Where is she?

436
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,960
- It's impossible.
- This is the girl I've been seeing.

437
00:44:51,136 --> 00:44:53,104
This girl, right here.

438
00:44:54,139 --> 00:44:55,868
She's dead.

439
00:44:59,111 --> 00:45:01,602
Rachel died four years ago.

440
00:46:09,715 --> 00:46:12,377
I'm a rational person.

441
00:46:12,951 --> 00:46:15,511
I believe in science.

442
00:46:16,788 --> 00:46:19,757
I don't believe in the paranormal.

443
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:24,989
And I don't believe in ghosts.

444
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,404
But if you are the ghost of Rachel Parsons...

445
00:46:34,907 --> 00:46:37,876
...then you would let me out of this cell.

446
00:47:48,747 --> 00:47:51,614
Bob, you leave this?

447
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,491
Shit. Pete's office.

448
00:49:05,057 --> 00:49:06,854
Chloe.

449
00:50:03,014 --> 00:50:04,845
Chloe!

450
00:50:15,193 --> 00:50:17,286
Help me!

451
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,760
Let me go! Let me go!

452
00:50:24,936 --> 00:50:28,372
Check Chloe! Check Chloe!
She needs help!

453
00:50:49,394 --> 00:50:53,091
- Did you talk to Chloe?
- Yes.

454
00:50:54,065 --> 00:50:57,466
- Was she raped?
- Was she raped? No.

455
00:50:57,636 --> 00:51:00,469
- Why?
- Did you check her?

456
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:03,938
Did I...? She was checked.
Of course she was checked.

457
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:06,509
- He didn't have time.
- He?

458
00:51:06,678 --> 00:51:11,809
- What about her face? She had a cut.
- She ran into a wall. She did that to herself.

459
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:17,280
I saw a tattoo. Did she talk about a tattoo?

460
00:51:17,455 --> 00:51:20,618
- Why don't you sit down. A tattoo?
- Yeah, a tattoo.

461
00:51:20,792 --> 00:51:26,094
A woman in flames, hands up like this:

462
00:51:26,264 --> 00:51:28,255
Like a Biblical image.

463
00:51:29,267 --> 00:51:30,700
The Anima Sola?

464
00:51:32,237 --> 00:51:37,072
- Yeah, the Anima Sola. That's what I saw.
- It's a common archetypal image.

465
00:51:37,242 --> 00:51:39,972
I mean, it's the woman in chains,
awaiting her fate.

466
00:51:40,145 --> 00:51:45,208
I'm talking about something I saw
on the chest of a man.

467
00:51:46,218 --> 00:51:48,584
- That's what I saw.
- You're in crisis.

468
00:51:48,753 --> 00:51:51,483
This image is tailor-made
for your state of mind.

469
00:51:51,957 --> 00:51:55,051
A woman in purgatory.

470
00:51:57,629 --> 00:51:59,893
I need you to explain this to me, though.

471
00:52:03,268 --> 00:52:08,570
- Rachel Parsons did not commit suicide.
- She jumped off a bridge.

472
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,903
- When I saw her...
- She was washed downstream five miles.

473
00:52:12,077 --> 00:52:14,637
- She was cut up.
- You saw her?

474
00:52:14,813 --> 00:52:19,182
- Yes, I saw her. Someone did that to her!
- Police, newspapers, coroner are wrong?

475
00:52:19,351 --> 00:52:21,581
- Let's reopen the case.
- Maybe they should!

476
00:52:21,753 --> 00:52:25,314
- I saw her. And she's connected to me.
- Delusions, hallucinations...

477
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:28,516
- How, I don't know.
... disorganized speech, incoherence...

478
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:33,756
Don't rattle off your psychiatric shit!
I know it like the back of my hand!

479
00:52:33,932 --> 00:52:35,627
Good.

480
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,961
Saves me the trouble.

481
00:52:39,237 --> 00:52:41,501
Glass cells are having electrical problems.

482
00:52:41,673 --> 00:52:44,164
I'm gonna transfer you to a Psych Ward cell.

483
00:52:44,442 --> 00:52:47,502
One strike, you're going to solitary.

484
00:52:48,046 --> 00:52:49,911
Don't screw up.

485
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,746
Rachel Parsons was there.

486
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,014
Dead or alive, I don't know.

487
00:52:59,524 --> 00:53:02,891
That girl came to me.

488
00:53:04,229 --> 00:53:06,857
She came to me.

489
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,364
Hi, Chloe.

490
00:53:52,877 --> 00:53:54,538
I'm sorry.

491
00:54:02,454 --> 00:54:04,183
I'm sorry.

492
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:07,483
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

493
00:54:08,393 --> 00:54:12,193
I need you to tell me who did this to you.

494
00:54:13,631 --> 00:54:15,758
Tell me his name, Chloe.

495
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:19,426
Chloe, tell me.
Tell me anything. Tell me.

496
00:54:20,939 --> 00:54:22,770
I'll tell you one thing:

497
00:54:23,441 --> 00:54:25,602
He can have my body...

498
00:54:26,144 --> 00:54:28,977
...but he will never have my soul.

499
00:54:29,147 --> 00:54:30,478
Never.

500
00:54:33,251 --> 00:54:35,048
The devil.

501
00:55:01,513 --> 00:55:03,481
It's okay.

502
00:55:04,783 --> 00:55:06,808
It's okay.

503
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,915
He said you're next.

504
00:55:25,937 --> 00:55:29,338
- Try to stay awake.
- Yes, ma'am.

505
00:55:29,574 --> 00:55:33,442
If you need me, I'll be in the coffee room.

506
00:55:46,591 --> 00:55:48,718
Lights out.

507
00:57:17,949 --> 00:57:19,883
Leave me alone!

508
00:57:26,424 --> 00:57:30,019
- Doesn't even look like a real ant.
- It's got disco balls for eyes.

509
00:57:30,528 --> 00:57:33,122
- '50s B movies, man.
- Giant bug movies are great.

510
00:57:33,298 --> 00:57:35,163
Hey, what is that?

511
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,774
It's Dr. Grey.
She's trying to kill herself.

512
00:57:46,077 --> 00:57:49,478
Level C, we've got suicidal behavior
in cell 33. Sending backup.

513
00:57:55,486 --> 00:57:57,181
Open it!

514
00:58:00,391 --> 00:58:02,825
Dr. Grey's in trouble!

515
00:58:06,664 --> 00:58:09,565
Number 33, open it now!

516
00:58:13,371 --> 00:58:16,602
Oh, damn.
Damn, what a mess.

517
00:58:16,774 --> 00:58:20,403
- Hold her, I'll medicate her.
- What the hell for? She's already out.

518
00:58:20,578 --> 00:58:22,944
Don't argue with me.

519
00:58:23,181 --> 00:58:26,582
Jesus! Easy, easy.
No, don't hurt me.

520
00:58:27,452 --> 00:58:30,080
Stop her! She's got my keys, stop her!

521
00:58:30,388 --> 00:58:31,878
Shit!

522
00:58:40,698 --> 00:58:42,461
Hey! Hey!

523
00:58:42,634 --> 00:58:43,896
Wait! Hey!

524
00:58:44,068 --> 00:58:46,935
We got a runner! Inmate escaping!
Block Three!

525
00:58:54,345 --> 00:58:56,813
- Stay with me.
- All right.

526
00:58:58,716 --> 00:59:01,207
She's gone this way. Let's go!

527
00:59:03,221 --> 00:59:05,121
Clear!

528
00:59:20,305 --> 00:59:21,738
Split up! Keep moving!

529
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:30,204
She's going up the North Tower!

530
00:59:44,495 --> 00:59:46,360
Shit!

531
01:00:07,051 --> 01:00:08,313
Shit!

532
01:00:11,956 --> 01:00:13,617
Hey! It's already open!

533
01:00:21,165 --> 01:00:22,530
She's on the upper level!

534
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:25,962
Hold it right there!

535
01:00:26,137 --> 01:00:29,004
- Dr. Grey!
- We're on Three, she's heading for One!

536
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:32,335
Go! Go!

537
01:00:35,646 --> 01:00:37,580
Go the other way!

538
01:00:48,693 --> 01:00:50,422
Circle back.

539
01:01:18,055 --> 01:01:19,682
Come on, Hank.

540
01:01:24,228 --> 01:01:26,696
Don't think she made it
to this building anyway.

541
01:01:30,368 --> 01:01:33,895
Yeah, but even so,
there's no way she can get out.

542
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:37,438
Hide-and-seek. The longer it lasts,
the more overtime we make.

543
01:02:09,607 --> 01:02:14,010
- You should be a professor.
- Professors always nail the pretty students.

544
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,620
Let's go. I don't think she's in here.

545
01:02:38,536 --> 01:02:40,060
I got it.

546
01:02:41,806 --> 01:02:43,364
Is it clear there?

547
01:02:46,911 --> 01:02:49,539
We checked corridors Four and Five.

548
01:02:49,714 --> 01:02:53,878
- It's cool. We're headed to Six and Seven.
- Yeah. It's Joe, up at the desk.

549
01:02:54,051 --> 01:02:57,077
- What's going on down there?
- Looks dark down there.

550
01:02:57,255 --> 01:02:59,314
What do you mean, what do I mean?

551
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:03,620
Look, this is the fourth time this month
this has happened. Never mind.

552
01:03:03,794 --> 01:03:07,321
- Ye... Thank you.
- Finally.

553
01:03:07,932 --> 01:03:09,365
- Took long enough.
- Shit.

554
01:03:10,301 --> 01:03:11,928
Hey, Joe.

555
01:03:13,804 --> 01:03:15,897
You see something?

556
01:03:16,073 --> 01:03:19,065
Yeah, just now when the monitors came on.

557
01:03:19,243 --> 01:03:22,974
Corridor Six, something flashed
in front of the camera.

558
01:03:23,147 --> 01:03:26,344
Frank, East Wing. Don, take the West.
I'll take the stairs.

559
01:03:31,556 --> 01:03:32,921
Here, take my car.

560
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:34,682
Go. Go.

561
01:03:35,326 --> 01:03:37,226
Go on.

562
01:05:07,685 --> 01:05:10,654
What do you want from me?!

563
01:06:06,911 --> 01:06:10,972
Okay. Now what?

564
01:07:45,776 --> 01:07:47,175
Miranda, no!

565
01:07:53,584 --> 01:07:55,142
Doug?

566
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:18,836
No. No, Miranda, no.

567
01:08:21,579 --> 01:08:24,548
Miranda, don't! No, don't, please!

568
01:08:24,715 --> 01:08:27,513
Please! No! Miranda, no!
No, please!

569
01:08:27,685 --> 01:08:31,621
Please! Don't do this to me! No!

570
01:08:31,789 --> 01:08:34,280
Don't! No! Miranda, no, wait!

571
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:36,449
Don't do this to me, please, Miranda!

572
01:08:36,627 --> 01:08:39,289
Miranda, no! Don't! No!

573
01:08:40,331 --> 01:08:43,323
Don't do this to me, Miranda!
Miranda, please!

574
01:08:43,934 --> 01:08:45,196
I love you.

575
01:08:45,469 --> 01:08:46,993
What did I do?

576
01:10:41,185 --> 01:10:42,914
Why?

577
01:10:43,153 --> 01:10:44,984
Why?

578
01:10:49,693 --> 01:10:51,661
Why me?

579
01:10:54,465 --> 01:10:57,263
Why? Why?

580
01:11:11,515 --> 01:11:13,176
Willow Creek.

581
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:14,612
<i>How was Willow Creek?</i>

582
01:11:14,952 --> 01:11:18,513
<i>This rain is slowing the work down.
It's a big damn mess.</i>

583
01:16:45,215 --> 01:16:47,775
<i>I'll see you in a couple of days.</i>

584
01:16:58,795 --> 01:17:00,626
<i>It's good to be God.</i>

585
01:17:01,598 --> 01:17:02,860
<i>I love you.</i>

586
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:30,085
- Drop the knife!
- Drop the gun!

587
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:31,659
Put it on the ground now!

588
01:17:31,828 --> 01:17:33,420
- Drop the gun!
- Drop the knife!

589
01:17:33,597 --> 01:17:36,088
- You drop it!
- Holy Christ.

590
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,799
What?

591
01:17:42,939 --> 01:17:44,270
Help me, please!

592
01:17:44,741 --> 01:17:46,231
Help!

593
01:17:46,643 --> 01:17:48,668
Carter, get down here now!

594
01:17:48,845 --> 01:17:50,710
Help me, please!

595
01:17:50,881 --> 01:17:52,781
Please!

596
01:17:53,784 --> 01:17:57,777
All I can tell you is that the girl
has been identified as Tracy Seavers.

597
01:17:57,954 --> 01:18:00,252
She was reported missing two weeks ago.

598
01:18:00,424 --> 01:18:03,689
She was found this morning
by two patrolmen in Willow Creek...

599
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:07,557
...at a farm belonging to Dr. Douglas Grey.
She is now hospitalized.

600
01:18:07,731 --> 01:18:09,858
Can she speak?
Has she told you anything?

601
01:18:10,033 --> 01:18:12,433
- We can't comment on that.
- Are there others?

602
01:18:12,602 --> 01:18:14,365
We can't confirm that. Excuse me.

603
01:18:14,538 --> 01:18:17,302
Sheriff, is the FBI taking over
this investigation?

604
01:18:17,474 --> 01:18:19,305
Why don't you ask the goddamn FBI?

605
01:18:19,476 --> 01:18:21,706
We need her at the hospital
for medication.

606
01:18:21,878 --> 01:18:25,109
Consider house arrest pending trial,
given the circumstances.

607
01:18:25,282 --> 01:18:27,910
Last night, your client dropped a guard...

608
01:18:28,084 --> 01:18:31,417
...assaulted a nurse, escaped from
an institution, stole a car...

609
01:18:31,588 --> 01:18:33,681
And saved a girl's life.

610
01:18:34,157 --> 01:18:36,591
- How did she know she was there?
- I don't know.

611
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,594
- But the point is...
- The woman is still a murder suspect!

612
01:18:41,131 --> 01:18:42,530
Come here.

613
01:18:47,137 --> 01:18:50,106
The FBI says there could be more victims.

614
01:18:50,273 --> 01:18:52,935
There were needles down there,
a video camera.

615
01:18:53,109 --> 01:18:56,101
Once the press gets ahold of it,
it'll get big and ugly.

616
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:59,378
Now, I need some answers,
and I'm running out of time.

617
01:18:59,549 --> 01:19:02,882
So your client isn't going anywhere
until my team...

618
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:12,651
I need to talk to her.

619
01:19:24,074 --> 01:19:27,771
It's hard to believe
Doug did something like this.

620
01:19:29,246 --> 01:19:32,647
We worked together a long time.
I thought I knew him pretty well.

621
01:19:37,053 --> 01:19:38,987
How could I be so blind?

622
01:19:42,225 --> 01:19:44,819
Well, you weren't the only one, Phil.

623
01:19:48,932 --> 01:19:52,698
Do you think my daughter could
also have been a victim of Doug's?

624
01:19:53,503 --> 01:19:55,027
Yes.

625
01:19:55,639 --> 01:19:58,039
That's what "not alone" means.

626
01:19:58,208 --> 01:20:03,168
Rachel was trying to tell me that
she was not Doug's only victim.

627
01:20:04,414 --> 01:20:06,644
And all this time...

628
01:20:07,651 --> 01:20:12,088
...we thought our baby
had committed suicide.

629
01:20:13,490 --> 01:20:14,980
You see...

630
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:17,592
...even after she was gone...

631
01:20:20,597 --> 01:20:21,859
Well...

632
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,592
What?

633
01:20:25,769 --> 01:20:28,101
I had this recurring dream about her.

634
01:20:28,638 --> 01:20:31,766
Eventually I took medication
to block it out.

635
01:20:31,942 --> 01:20:33,409
What kind of dream?

636
01:20:33,577 --> 01:20:38,139
She was burning in flames,
in terrible pain.

637
01:20:38,515 --> 01:20:40,642
I couldn't save her.

638
01:20:41,451 --> 01:20:45,683
I saw her exactly the same way,
burning in flames.

639
01:20:46,056 --> 01:20:47,853
What does that mean?

640
01:20:49,492 --> 01:20:51,960
Miranda, I... I...

641
01:20:52,963 --> 01:20:55,295
I wouldn't look for
a real-world explanation.

642
01:20:55,932 --> 01:20:59,231
It's a dream, a delusion.

643
01:20:59,402 --> 01:21:02,963
A delusion that we both seem to share.

644
01:21:13,316 --> 01:21:14,749
- Yeah.
- Pete.

645
01:21:14,918 --> 01:21:16,545
I was just talking to Parsons.

646
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:18,950
I've been wrong about
everything until now.

647
01:21:19,122 --> 01:21:22,091
It's finally clear to me.
The image is finally clear.

648
01:21:22,258 --> 01:21:25,386
The man raping women in prison
is connected to the murders.

649
01:21:25,562 --> 01:21:27,553
It goes back to the Anima Sola tattoo.

650
01:21:27,731 --> 01:21:30,962
Miranda, you have to stop doing this.
Do you understand me?

651
01:21:31,267 --> 01:21:35,795
<i>Every time people start taking you seriously,
you start talking about delusions again.</i>

652
01:21:35,972 --> 01:21:38,566
I'm not deluded, Pete, I'm possessed.

653
01:21:39,376 --> 01:21:42,038
I don't believe in ghosts.

654
01:21:42,512 --> 01:21:45,675
Neither do I, but they believe in me.

655
01:21:45,849 --> 01:21:48,147
<i>Great, just great.</i>

656
01:22:01,031 --> 01:22:03,056
Let's go. Come on.

657
01:22:09,272 --> 01:22:11,206
I need to talk to Sheriff Ryan.

658
01:22:11,374 --> 01:22:14,343
He's working with the FBI team.
He won't be back tonight.

659
01:22:14,511 --> 01:22:16,536
It's really important.

660
01:22:16,713 --> 01:22:18,681
I'll leave him a message.

661
01:22:20,717 --> 01:22:22,275
Thank you.

662
01:22:40,303 --> 01:22:41,895
Screw it.

663
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:20,104
I got a message you wanted to talk to me?

664
01:23:20,543 --> 01:23:23,376
Yeah, Bob.

665
01:23:23,546 --> 01:23:27,448
I wanna talk to you.
Maybe this time you can actually hear me.

666
01:23:27,684 --> 01:23:32,178
Because the last time, all you wanted to do
was scream and yell and accuse me...

667
01:23:32,355 --> 01:23:36,689
- Is this what you wanna talk to me about?
- No. I wanna talk about the facts.

668
01:23:36,860 --> 01:23:38,953
They're a little different now, right?

669
01:23:40,764 --> 01:23:45,258
Do you have any idea what happens to a
small-town sheriff when the FBI takes over?

670
01:23:45,435 --> 01:23:48,632
- Lf you know anything, anything...
- Not alone.

671
01:23:49,139 --> 01:23:50,401
What?

672
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:52,207
Not alone.

673
01:23:52,509 --> 01:23:54,602
I know what it means.

674
01:23:55,178 --> 01:23:57,442
There are two killers.

675
01:23:58,481 --> 01:24:01,712
Parsons and I both saw a girl
burning in flames.

676
01:24:01,885 --> 01:24:06,413
Then I saw Chloe being raped by a man
with an Anima Sola tattoo on his body.

677
01:24:06,589 --> 01:24:10,491
A woman burning in flames. Get it?

678
01:24:10,894 --> 01:24:15,194
Okay, it's crazy. I know it sounds crazy.
Pete has told me it's crazy.

679
01:24:15,365 --> 01:24:17,959
- You told Pete? When?
- Yes.

680
01:24:18,134 --> 01:24:19,658
Yes.

681
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:22,331
This afternoon. Why?

682
01:24:24,674 --> 01:24:28,974
I don't think you're crazy at all.
And I don't know why he would dismiss it.

683
01:24:29,145 --> 01:24:33,946
- You actually saw this tattoo?
- Yes, I saw it. On a man.

684
01:24:34,117 --> 01:24:36,585
I've heard of serial killers
who hunt together.

685
01:24:36,753 --> 01:24:38,778
Classic mentor and disciple syndrome.

686
01:24:38,955 --> 01:24:42,186
So we're looking for the disciple?
Who could it be?

687
01:24:42,358 --> 01:24:44,588
- I don't know.
- You're a psychiatrist.

688
01:24:44,761 --> 01:24:47,025
What kind of guy would this have to be?

689
01:24:47,931 --> 01:24:49,489
Okay.

690
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:55,967
He would have to be someone
who grew up in a household...

691
01:24:56,139 --> 01:24:58,334
...that had an absent father.

692
01:24:58,541 --> 01:25:00,600
He developed...

693
01:25:00,777 --> 01:25:04,076
...an obsessive, over-dependent
relationship with his mother...

694
01:25:04,247 --> 01:25:08,206
...which then turned into some
inappropriate sexual attraction.

695
01:25:08,551 --> 01:25:12,954
He probably even got off
torturing little animals as a kid.

696
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:19,419
And as a man he is totally confused
about his sexuality.

697
01:25:19,596 --> 01:25:21,564
That's who he is.

698
01:25:23,132 --> 01:25:26,329
Man, that's screwed up.

699
01:25:27,437 --> 01:25:30,838
But a guy like that could seem
smart and normal, right?

700
01:25:31,007 --> 01:25:32,838
Yeah, they usually do. Yeah.

701
01:25:33,009 --> 01:25:35,603
Look, Miranda, I don't wanna scare you...

702
01:25:36,045 --> 01:25:41,574
...but if there is a second killer out there,
he is frantically trying to cover his trail.

703
01:25:41,751 --> 01:25:45,209
You're a big threat to this guy.
Who knows how much more you know?

704
01:25:45,388 --> 01:25:46,855
I don't know anything else.

705
01:25:47,223 --> 01:25:49,657
You saw the tattoo,
found the girl at the barn.

706
01:25:49,826 --> 01:25:51,885
Yeah, but I found all that by instinct.

707
01:25:52,061 --> 01:25:54,586
This guy is facing the electric chair.

708
01:25:55,064 --> 01:25:58,295
He doesn't have the luxury
of believing in instinct or ghosts.

709
01:25:58,468 --> 01:26:02,268
He's gotta believe that Doug
confessed to you what he was doing.

710
01:26:03,339 --> 01:26:04,897
But he didn't confess.

711
01:26:05,308 --> 01:26:07,970
Maybe he didn't spill it out loud, but...

712
01:26:08,945 --> 01:26:12,073
Well, you know, you're a psychiatrist.

713
01:26:12,415 --> 01:26:15,009
There's a lot of ways to confess.

714
01:26:16,019 --> 01:26:19,921
I'm just trying to put myself
in this guy's place.

715
01:26:23,293 --> 01:26:26,160
Then why didn't he go back
to Willow Creek?

716
01:26:26,663 --> 01:26:30,224
- Take care of the girl, clean up evidence?
- Yeah.

717
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:34,001
Well, that's how you get caught.
You panic.

718
01:26:35,071 --> 01:26:37,596
Better to let the dust settle.

719
01:26:38,508 --> 01:26:40,373
But about you...

720
01:26:40,777 --> 01:26:43,075
...he's desperate.
- Yeah?

721
01:26:43,579 --> 01:26:45,638
Desperate enough to...

722
01:26:46,015 --> 01:26:47,505
...talk to me?

723
01:26:51,754 --> 01:26:53,551
Well, you're right.

724
01:26:53,756 --> 01:26:55,986
I do fit the profile.

725
01:26:56,259 --> 01:27:00,059
Longtime friend of Doug's,
access to the prison.

726
01:27:01,698 --> 01:27:04,633
I never did get a kick out of
torturing animals, though.

727
01:27:08,271 --> 01:27:09,761
Stop it!

728
01:27:11,374 --> 01:27:12,898
- No!
- Yes!

729
01:27:15,645 --> 01:27:18,239
- You can't kill me!
- I'm not gonna kill you.

730
01:27:18,414 --> 01:27:22,714
After this kicks in, I'm gonna have a lot
more fun with you than Doug ever did.

731
01:27:22,885 --> 01:27:24,375
Help!

732
01:27:35,598 --> 01:27:37,589
Miranda!

733
01:27:41,537 --> 01:27:42,868
Damn it!

734
01:27:44,574 --> 01:27:46,542
Help me! Help!

735
01:27:49,278 --> 01:27:51,109
Help me!

736
01:28:16,072 --> 01:28:18,040
Okay.

737
01:28:20,276 --> 01:28:22,904
You tried to escape, Miranda.

738
01:28:24,013 --> 01:28:28,712
That means I can do
whatever I want to you.

739
01:28:32,722 --> 01:28:35,316
Rachel wasn't the first, you know.

740
01:28:36,325 --> 01:28:40,557
Doug killed a girl when he was
15 years old!

741
01:28:42,265 --> 01:28:44,597
I helped him bury the body.

742
01:28:49,839 --> 01:28:51,397
What are best friends for?

743
01:28:54,477 --> 01:28:56,945
We got older. But I gotta tell you...

744
01:28:57,113 --> 01:29:00,378
...you never lose your taste
for the young girls.

745
01:29:00,783 --> 01:29:04,014
Then we stopped for a long time.

746
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:07,814
But then Dougie saw sweet Rachel and...

747
01:29:09,725 --> 01:29:13,058
That was an itch way too deep
not to scratch.

748
01:29:14,964 --> 01:29:19,025
And then we had the time of our lives
out at Willow Creek.

749
01:29:19,802 --> 01:29:21,895
Everything was perfect.

750
01:29:22,071 --> 01:29:24,767
Those girls would do anything.

751
01:29:25,007 --> 01:29:26,872
We were their god.

752
01:29:27,577 --> 01:29:29,442
Until you...

753
01:29:30,746 --> 01:29:32,737
Miranda!

754
01:29:38,788 --> 01:29:42,053
You and I both know
you're not getting out of here.

755
01:29:42,225 --> 01:29:44,489
So let's be logical...

756
01:29:44,727 --> 01:29:47,355
...and end this thing.

757
01:29:56,606 --> 01:29:59,541
Thank you, Miranda.

758
01:30:08,918 --> 01:30:10,545
Rachel?

759
01:30:15,458 --> 01:30:17,449
This isn't logical.

760
01:30:17,627 --> 01:30:19,527
You're already dead!

761
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:48,379
Logic is overrated.

762
01:31:29,565 --> 01:31:31,590
I'm sorry, Miranda.

763
01:31:43,446 --> 01:31:48,509
So it's been almost a year
and I still have bad dreams.

764
01:31:49,151 --> 01:31:51,551
Sometimes I wake up screaming.

765
01:31:51,821 --> 01:31:53,345
That's normal.

766
01:31:53,522 --> 01:31:56,116
No, not these dreams.

767
01:31:57,026 --> 01:31:59,790
Everyone thought you and I were crazy...

768
01:32:00,096 --> 01:32:02,064
...but we were seeing the truth.

769
01:32:02,231 --> 01:32:04,222
More than they could see.

770
01:32:05,268 --> 01:32:08,431
Once you open the door,
you can never close it.

771
01:32:08,604 --> 01:32:11,334
Not true. I closed it.

772
01:32:11,507 --> 01:32:13,338
Then I locked it...

773
01:32:13,509 --> 01:32:15,272
...and then I threw away the key.

774
01:32:15,444 --> 01:32:17,878
I really hope that's true.

775
01:32:18,281 --> 01:32:21,614
You know, my train leaves in half an hour.

776
01:32:21,884 --> 01:32:24,751
Okay. I'll get you on your way.

777
01:32:27,857 --> 01:32:31,793
So good luck with your job, okay?

778
01:32:33,863 --> 01:32:36,923
I wanted to thank you for what you did.

779
01:32:38,434 --> 01:32:40,129
You really helped me.

780
01:32:40,303 --> 01:32:42,294
You helped me.

781
01:32:42,505 --> 01:32:44,803
You taught me how to listen.

782
01:32:45,174 --> 01:32:46,766
Thank you.

783
01:32:48,544 --> 01:32:50,341
We made it.

784
01:33:41,564 --> 01:33:43,122
No!
