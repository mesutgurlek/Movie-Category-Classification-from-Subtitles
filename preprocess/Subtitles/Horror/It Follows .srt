1
00:01:20,492 --> 00:01:23,100
Hey, Are you okay?

2
00:01:23,592 --> 00:01:24,771
Yeah.

3
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,006
You need some help?

4
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,494
No.

5
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:38,826
Annie, what're you doing?

6
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:41,125
I'm fine, dad.

7
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:00,575
What's the matter?

8
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,849
What's going on?

9
00:02:08,577 --> 00:02:09,780
Annie?

10
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:08,681
Dad.

11
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,529
I love you.

12
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:16,261
I know.

13
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:19,553
I just want you and mom to know
how much I love you.

14
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:27,040
Dad, I'm sorry that I can be such
a shit to you sometimes.

15
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,214
I don't know why I do that.

16
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,791
Just know that I love you, okay.

17
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,220
I just really love you both.

18
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,986
Hey, Jay.

19
00:05:18,472 --> 00:05:19,954
Hey, what's up?

20
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:23,051
Nothing.
How long you out here?

21
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,258
I'm going to watch a moive.
See if you like it?

22
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:27,670
Actually, I'm going out tonight.

23
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:29,647
That guy?

24
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:32,960
I like hm.

25
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,347
Me too.

26
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:57,661
I see you.

27
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:52,698
What're you reading?

28
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,358
The idiot.
(Fyodor Dostoyevsky)

29
00:06:55,993 --> 00:06:57,663
Is it any good?

30
00:06:58,164 --> 00:06:59,567
I don't know yet.

31
00:06:59,778 --> 00:07:01,346
It's about Paul.

32
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:03,963
Hey, Jay.

33
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,332
Hey, Paul.

34
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,152
Stop.

35
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,949
Hey, I've an idea.

36
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:16,568
What?

37
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,622
It got away.

38
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:50,822
You ever played the 'Trade' game?

39
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:53,236
No, what is that?

40
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:54,877
It's people watching game.

41
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,353
My sister and I used to play
when we were bored.

42
00:08:57,798 --> 00:08:59,409
You are bored right now?

43
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:00,771
No, shut up.

44
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:02,225
Let me finish.

45
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:04,506
Okay, how do you play it?

46
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,321
You start by watching the crowd.

47
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:10,728
Casually just go by the people
around you.

48
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:12,859
Okay.

49
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:14,938
Now, without telling me.

50
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,761
Pick a person you want to
trade places with.

51
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:20,932
It can be anyone,
for whatever reason.

52
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,228
Okay.
I got it.

53
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,895
Now, I get 2 guesses to figure out.

54
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,230
Who you pick.
And why you want to trade places with them.

55
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:36,756
Okay,
good luck.

56
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,705
That guy.

57
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,785
No.

58
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:51,335
Okay then.
Who you picked.

59
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:54,509
Him.

60
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:57,320
The dad?

61
00:09:57,412 --> 00:09:58,807
No.
The son.

62
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:01,131
I mean how cool that'll be.
Like you whole life is out of you.

63
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,218
You know.

64
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:03,330
Come on

65
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:05,496
It's not like you are old.
You are 21

66
00:10:06,494 --> 00:10:08,050
I know,
but.

67
00:10:09,202 --> 00:10:11,420
Look how happy that kid is.

68
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:14,925
Plus, at that age you could go to the
barthroom anything time you want.

69
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,143
Total freedom.

70
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:17,142
Yeah.

71
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:18,727
Splashing his shirt right now.

72
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:22,274
Yeah, exactly.
I can never get away with that.

73
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:28,498
Okay, my turn.

74
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:31,635
Okay.

75
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:41,714
Okay, got it.

76
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:55,589
How about the girl in
the yellow dress?

77
00:10:57,996 --> 00:10:59,286
Where?

78
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:01,959
Right there.

79
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:04,480
I don't see her.

80
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:06,043
Right there.

81
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:11,924
Are you teasing me?

82
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:15,417
I'm sorry, I just...
I don't...

83
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,667
Can we go?

84
00:11:17,287 --> 00:11:18,501
I'm sorry, I just have to go.

85
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:20,755
If you uh... Can we... can we go
back into the car?

86
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,917
Is there someone in there
that made you want to leave?

87
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,254
Like an ex-girlfriend or something?

88
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,405
You said you saw a
girl in yellow dress.

89
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,117
Is that someone that you knew?

90
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:34,877
No, I just felt sick.
I feel better being outside.

91
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:25,212
Thanks for walking with me.

92
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:28,599
Mom knows you smoke.

93
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:31,955
Yeah but, she'll cry if
she actually sees it happening.

94
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,453
Or she'll just steal your cigarettes.

95
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:37,694
How's it going with you?

96
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:40,751
Good.

97
00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:42,437
Honestly.

98
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,305
I don't know.
He was acting kind of weird last night.

99
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,607
Why?

100
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:51,106
He said he wasn't feeling well
but...

101
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:53,197
Something else was on his mind.

102
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:56,866
Have you.

103
00:12:57,428 --> 00:12:59,372
No.

104
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:01,384
I know he wants to, but...

105
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:05,167
I don't know.
He seemed different last night.

106
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:13,470
Do you smell that?

107
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:18,003
Like uh..
cherry coke, bananas nicotine.

108
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,510
That's my favorite flavor.

109
00:13:19,535 --> 00:13:21,133
I... love it.

110
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,121
Let's go back to the car.

111
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:19,294
That's funny.

112
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:22,453
I used to day dream about
being old enough to go on dates.

113
00:16:23,594 --> 00:16:26,118
Driving around with my friends
in their cars.

114
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:30,471
I had this image of myself.

115
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:33,937
Holding hands with a
really cute guy.

116
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,105
Listening to the radio.

117
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:39,858
Driving along some pretty road.

118
00:16:40,493 --> 00:16:42,384
Up north maybe.

119
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:45,566
And the trees start to change colors.

120
00:16:50,814 --> 00:16:53,235
It's never about going anywhere really.

121
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,783
Some sort of freedom I guess.

122
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,734
Never old enough,
the hell do we go.

123
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,150
Jay.

124
00:18:21,382 --> 00:18:22,831
You awake?

125
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:28,253
I'm sorry.

126
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:32,846
What are you doing?

127
00:18:39,094 --> 00:18:40,754
I'm not going to hurt you.

128
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:42,811
Don' t worry.

129
00:18:49,844 --> 00:18:51,634
You're not going to believe me.

130
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:55,105
But I need you to remember
what I'm saying.

131
00:18:56,692 --> 00:18:57,935
Okay?

132
00:19:03,803 --> 00:19:05,235
This thing.

133
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,693
It's going to follow you.

134
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:16,970
Somebody gave it to me.

135
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,216
And I pass it to you.

136
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,929
Back in the car.

137
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,930
It could look like someone you know.

138
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,473
Or it could be a stranger in a crowd.

139
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:34,150
Whatever helps it to get close to you.

140
00:19:35,697 --> 00:19:37,787
He could look like anyone.

141
00:19:38,976 --> 00:19:41,013
But there is only one of it.

142
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,764
Help.

143
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,677
Help!

144
00:19:49,784 --> 00:19:51,415
And sometimes.

145
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:53,538
Sometimes I think it looks like.

146
00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:57,436
People you love.
Just to hurt you.

147
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,252
I see it.

148
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:41,333
Who is it?

149
00:20:55,302 --> 00:20:57,166
You get rid of it,
okay.

150
00:20:57,201 --> 00:20:59,500
Just sleep with someone
as soon as you can.

151
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:01,134
Just pass it along

152
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:03,319
If it kills you.
It'll come after me.

153
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:04,933
Do you understand?

154
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:14,448
What the fuck do you want?

155
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:19,771
Jay,
I'm doing this to help you.

156
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,395
Just to let you know,
it's real.

157
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,376
Help!

158
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,107
Help me.

159
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:52,007
Never go into a place that
doesn't have more than one exit.

160
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:54,022
It's very slow.
But it's not dumb.

161
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:11,395
Can I have some?

162
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:12,832
Yeah.

163
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,900
Listen to this,

164
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:22,718
<i>“I think that if one is faced by
inevitable destruction -</i>

165
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,171
<i>if a house is falling upon you,
for instance -</i>

166
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,446
<i>one must feel a great longing to sit down,</i>

167
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:30,692
<i>close one's eyes and wait,</i>

168
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:32,824
<i>come what may...”
( Fyodor Dostoyevsky, "The Idiot" )</i>

169
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:35,495
That's why we're drinking on the porch.

170
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:39,751
Is you mom asleep already?

171
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,102
Almost for sure.

172
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:44,392
She wakes up at 5.15.

173
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:46,171
That would kill me.

174
00:22:46,189 --> 00:22:47,301
So.

175
00:22:47,434 --> 00:22:48,903
Where is Jay at?

176
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:51,710
On a date.

177
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:55,324
Your turn.

178
00:22:55,698 --> 00:22:57,006
Who is he?

179
00:22:57,699 --> 00:22:59,046
Somebody new.

180
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:00,674
Of course.

181
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:02,927
Your sister is so pretty.
it's annoying.

182
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:04,148
It is annoying.

183
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:05,729
Anyway, she's nice.

184
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:23,503
Is everything okay?

185
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:33,991
Don't let it touch you.

186
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:53,645
Jay!

187
00:24:16,772 --> 00:24:18,017
What happened?

188
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:20,872
I don't know.

189
00:24:24,745 --> 00:24:26,875
Those people are such a mess.

190
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,620
It was consensual.

191
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,661
Yeah.

192
00:24:41,426 --> 00:24:43,779
And, you never see the woman before?

193
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:48,515
No.

194
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:49,973
Okay.

195
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:51,908
Have you ever been to his home?

196
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:57,319
I know where he live,
but...

197
00:24:58,257 --> 00:25:00,169
I never went inside.

198
00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:04,657
He said he was embarrassed where he lived.

199
00:25:54,768 --> 00:25:56,472
Did she catch anything?

200
00:25:58,184 --> 00:25:59,733
I don't think so.

201
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:02,488
Ah...
Poor Jamie.

202
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:08,053
Apparently he used a fake name
to rent a house in the city

203
00:26:08,214 --> 00:26:10,477
The police searched the place,
they can't find him.

204
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:12,106
Oh my God.

205
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,764
Breaks my heart the things he said to her.

206
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:16,892
Some weird, sick.

207
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,518
<i>"I should have been a pair of ragged claws</i>

208
00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:28,405
<i>scuttling across floors of silent seas"</i>

209
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:33,939
<i>And the afternoon, the evening,

210
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:37,499

211
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:41,983

212
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:46,118
<i>Stretched out on the floor,
here beside you and me.</i>

213
00:27:46,655 --> 00:27:51,238
<i>Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,</i>

214
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:55,669
<i>Have the strength to force
the moment to its crisis?</i>

215
00:27:56,215 --> 00:27:58,791

216
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:01,149

224

225
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:32,957

00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:39,573

228
00:28:39,598 --> 00:28:42,654
<i>To have bitten off the matter with a smile,</i>

229
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,657

230

00:29:01,383 --> 00:29:05,265

235
00:29:05,297 --> 00:29:07,782
<i>That is not it, at all.”</i>

236
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:09,545
Excuse me.

237
00:29:11,057 --> 00:29:12,340
Excuse me.

238
00:29:40,015 --> 00:29:41,311
Hello?

239
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:43,829
Hello.

240
00:30:43,514 --> 00:30:45,651
There's an old woman at school today.

241
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:48,346
And she's staring at me.

242
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:51,772
It was like she was following me.

243
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,390
Did you know her?

244
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:56,702
No, but she freaked me out.

245
00:30:58,029 --> 00:30:59,952
I didn't go back to class.

246
00:31:01,114 --> 00:31:02,990
Did she say something to you?

247
00:31:07,503 --> 00:31:09,213
Hugh told me that.

248
00:31:09,457 --> 00:31:11,529
He passed it on to me.

249
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,461
He said it was going to follow me.

250
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:18,558
That's all bullshit,
Jamie.

251
00:31:21,736 --> 00:31:23,279
Yeah, I know.

252
00:31:25,204 --> 00:31:27,813
What exactly is suppose to be
following you?

253
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,129
I don't know.

254
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:33,854
You should tell mom what you saw.

255
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:35,125
No.

256
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:37,566
Jay.
I'm worried about you.

257
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,612
I could.. stay over tonight,
If to make you feel any better.

258
00:31:41,637 --> 00:31:42,790
- No.
- No.

259
00:31:42,815 --> 00:31:44,146
Sleep on the couch
or something.

260
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:45,243
No.

261
00:31:47,486 --> 00:31:49,038
Maybe just on the couch.

262
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:52,783
You should be more worry about waking up
and finding Paul humping you leg.

263
00:31:52,818 --> 00:31:53,914
Um...

264
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:57,838
I choosing to ignore all these insults
to my character.

265
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,858
Just,
keep your door locked.

266
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:03,715
Look.

267
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:06,949
I'm going to stay up all night,
And keep an eye out for anything weird.

268
00:32:07,643 --> 00:32:09,950
Nothing is going to happen,
okay.

269
00:33:44,637 --> 00:33:46,157
I can't sleep.

270
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:47,739
Not in there.

271
00:33:49,142 --> 00:33:50,379
That's okay.

272
00:33:50,857 --> 00:33:52,196
Just sleep here.

273
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,071
Are you okay?

274
00:34:32,577 --> 00:34:34,169
Everything is going to be cool.

275
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:38,301
That's funny.

276
00:34:38,595 --> 00:34:41,755
I haven't spent a night over here
since we were kids.

277
00:34:46,134 --> 00:34:47,945
There's a reason for that.

278
00:34:48,113 --> 00:34:49,237
Shut up.

279
00:34:49,278 --> 00:34:50,809
I'm...
serious.

280
00:34:53,634 --> 00:34:55,626
It's cool spending time with you.

281
00:34:56,851 --> 00:34:58,001
Yeah.

282
00:35:11,842 --> 00:35:13,890
You're my first kiss,
you know.

283
00:35:16,738 --> 00:35:17,882
I know.

284
00:35:19,363 --> 00:35:20,995
Is that not yours?

285
00:35:22,547 --> 00:35:23,827
No uh.

286
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,396
You were.

287
00:35:27,749 --> 00:35:29,895
And then you kissed Kelly.

288
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:33,826
She told me.

289
00:35:35,152 --> 00:35:37,667
You kiss your sisters,
that's kind of gross.

290
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:43,010
Do you remember,..

291
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:44,184
...the time.

292
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:47,681
That we found those
porno magazines,

293
00:35:47,706 --> 00:35:49,729
...in the alley by Barry's pizza?

294
00:35:49,754 --> 00:35:51,027
Yeah.

295
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:53,482
We're such stupid kids.

296
00:35:53,507 --> 00:35:54,581
Ridiculous.

297
00:35:54,606 --> 00:35:58,090
We are all
sitting out on Greg's front lawn.

298
00:35:58,115 --> 00:35:59,930
With a dozen dirty magazines.

299
00:35:59,963 --> 00:36:02,942
Just sprawled out everywhere.
and we were laughing.

300
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:05,387
And we didn't realised
how bad it was.

301
00:36:05,681 --> 00:36:07,610
Oh, and Greg's mom.

302
00:36:07,635 --> 00:36:11,153
Remember her face when she came out.
And saw us reading that shit.

303
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:13,816
And she scooped them up so fast.

304
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:15,728
And then she called me mom.

305
00:36:15,914 --> 00:36:18,461
Kel and I got the sex ed talk
the next day.

306
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,165
I got one too.

307
00:36:20,883 --> 00:36:22,153
What the fuck?

308
00:36:22,178 --> 00:36:23,391
Go look.

309
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:42,629
There's a broken window in the kitchen.
But...

310
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:44,144
... there's no one there.

311
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:45,180
Are you sure?

312
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:48,056
Yeah. I mean whoever broke it
must have run away.

313
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,541
Maybe we should call the police.

314
00:36:49,566 --> 00:36:51,776
I'm going to wake up your siser.
She should call.

315
00:38:59,301 --> 00:39:00,509
Jay.

316
00:39:00,534 --> 00:39:02,140
Jan.
Can you open the door?

317
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:03,788
It's in the house.

318
00:39:03,812 --> 00:39:04,944
What's going on?

319
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,590
There's nothing in the house,
Jay.

320
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:10,236
I saw it.

321
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:13,338
Open the door.
Okay.

322
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,702
It's in the kitchen.

323
00:39:14,737 --> 00:39:16,604
I'm not going to let anything
happen to you.

324
00:39:16,628 --> 00:39:18,815
Open the door,
and we'll figure this out.

325
00:39:18,841 --> 00:39:20,656
There's nothing out here.

326
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,173
Okay.

327
00:39:48,005 --> 00:39:49,701
Jay, why don't you sit down.

328
00:39:51,448 --> 00:39:52,967
I need water.

329
00:39:53,062 --> 00:39:54,816
Oh, I got to need water.

330
00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:56,347
Okay, I'll get you some.

331
00:39:56,372 --> 00:39:57,765
No, stay here!

332
00:40:04,657 --> 00:40:06,637
Is something wrong with me?

333
00:40:08,266 --> 00:40:10,289
Look, somebody broke the window,

334
00:40:10,314 --> 00:40:11,524
That really happened.

335
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:13,428
But I saw a girl in the kitchen.

336
00:40:14,728 --> 00:40:16,053
Jay.

337
00:40:16,686 --> 00:40:18,191
I love you.

338
00:40:18,524 --> 00:40:19,944
You're okay.

339
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:22,269
You don't believe me.

340
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:25,108
Mom?

341
00:40:42,967 --> 00:40:44,537
Mom, is that you?

342
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,299
No, it's me.

343
00:40:46,549 --> 00:40:47,628
Yara?

344
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,894
Yeah.

345
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,741
Don't open the door.

346
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:56,475
See.
Everything's okay.

347
00:40:58,524 --> 00:41:00,252
Oh...!

348
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:01,425
God...!

349
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,524
Wait.

350
00:41:03,704 --> 00:41:04,865
Jay.

351
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,179
What are you doing?

352
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:25,077
Hey, Jay.
Wait!

353
00:41:27,663 --> 00:41:28,715
Jay!

354
00:43:07,925 --> 00:43:09,034
Jay!

355
00:43:11,162 --> 00:43:12,889
You could've hurt yourself.

356
00:43:12,914 --> 00:43:14,311
What are you doing?

357
00:43:19,275 --> 00:43:20,604
I'm scared.

358
00:43:21,352 --> 00:43:23,041
Me too.

359
00:43:23,076 --> 00:43:24,614
We will figure it out.

360
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:26,619
You can't tell mom.

361
00:43:27,709 --> 00:43:30,351
And she'll freaked out.
And she won't believe me.

362
00:43:30,662 --> 00:43:32,745
I know.
It's okay.

363
00:43:33,464 --> 00:43:35,398
What are you running from?

364
00:43:38,814 --> 00:43:40,354
Do you see that?

365
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:42,829
I do.

366
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:45,379
It's...
It's a person.

367
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:47,718
Greg?

368
00:43:47,743 --> 00:43:50,038
What the hell is going on?
You okay?

369
00:43:50,146 --> 00:43:52,033
Someone broke into their house.

370
00:43:52,058 --> 00:43:53,381
Shit.

371
00:43:53,557 --> 00:43:55,430
Did you call the police?

372
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:58,554
I don't want to go home.

373
00:43:58,574 --> 00:44:00,236
Where you want to go?

374
00:44:04,327 --> 00:44:06,610
I... I need to find him.

375
00:44:06,738 --> 00:44:08,708
The person who broke into your house?

376
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:11,661
No.

377
00:44:12,368 --> 00:44:13,587
Hugh?

378
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:19,115
What did he really do to you?

379
00:44:24,893 --> 00:44:26,103
Okay.

380
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,918
Are you leaving?

381
00:44:29,491 --> 00:44:31,493
No, I'm...
getting my car.

382
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:33,379
Someone's got to drive. right?

383
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:16,929
God.

384
00:48:53,092 --> 00:48:55,391
Hey,
come ook at this.

385
00:49:00,268 --> 00:49:01,386
What?

386
00:49:02,116 --> 00:49:03,632
Is this him?

387
00:49:05,808 --> 00:49:07,665
You recognise the jacket?

00:49:08,808 --> 00:49:10,505

00:49:11,297 --> 00:49:13,801

403
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:56,601

- Yup.

404
00:50:56,626 --> 00:50:58,349
Real name is Jeff.

405
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,404
Not Hugh?

406
00:50:59,448 --> 00:51:00,923
Jeff Raymond.

407
00:51:01,005 --> 00:51:02,833
Do we tell the police?

408
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:06,888
No.

409
00:51:51,813 --> 00:51:53,025
Hello?

410
00:51:54,688 --> 00:51:58,292
Hi uh.
Is Jeff here?

411
00:51:58,317 --> 00:52:01,762
Yeah, yeah he is.
You want to come in?

412
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,261
Yeah.

413
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:07,940
Your friends?

414
00:52:15,124 --> 00:52:17,049
Okay,
even though it's following you

415
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,513
I can still see it.

416
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,297
It's not done with me either.
Okay.

417
00:52:22,381 --> 00:52:23,769
LIke I told you.

418
00:52:24,203 --> 00:52:26,686
All you can do is pass it on
to someone else.

419
00:52:27,815 --> 00:52:29,466
What the fuck are you talking about?

420
00:52:29,551 --> 00:52:31,786
She can do the same thing I did.

421
00:52:32,143 --> 00:52:34,331
It should be easier for her,
she's a girl.

422
00:52:34,832 --> 00:52:35,852
Any guy would be with you.

423
00:52:35,877 --> 00:52:38,188
Just sleep with someone else and
tell him to do the same thing.

424
00:52:38,213 --> 00:52:39,682
Maybe it'll never come back.

425
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:40,828
This isn't real.

426
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:43,434
I swear to you.
This is just some fuck up game

427
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:47,379
Look.
I'm not safe either, Okay.

428
00:52:47,993 --> 00:52:49,290
We shouldn't even be in the same place.

429
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,153
I'm sorry, your guys need
to get the fuck out of here.

430
00:52:51,178 --> 00:52:52,275
Hey.

431
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,370
Watch it.

432
00:52:53,411 --> 00:52:56,103
If it kills her.
It gets me.

433
00:52:56,134 --> 00:52:59,052
It goes straight down the line,
whoever started it.

434
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:01,317
Jay.

435
00:53:02,274 --> 00:53:03,649
I'm sorry.

436
00:53:04,087 --> 00:53:05,562
I wasn't trying to hurt you,
okay.

437
00:53:05,587 --> 00:53:08,065
Someone did this to me too.
Okay.

438
00:53:08,749 --> 00:53:10,696
Who did this to you?

439
00:53:11,706 --> 00:53:13,457
I met a girl at the bar.

440
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:16,654
Its a one night stand.
I don't even remember her name.

441
00:53:17,554 --> 00:53:19,683
I think that's where it came from.

442
00:53:20,761 --> 00:53:23,339
Jeff.
I don't believe you.

443
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,185
She might.

444
00:53:25,261 --> 00:53:26,626
But I think you're a fucking liar.

445
00:53:26,627 --> 00:53:28,554
What you're doing to
her is some fuck up shit.

446
00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:30,453
Do you guys see that girl
right there?

447
00:53:33,326 --> 00:53:34,889
- Yeah. - Uh huh.
- Yes.

448
00:53:35,098 --> 00:53:36,303
Yeah.

449
00:53:37,244 --> 00:53:38,462
Okay.

450
00:53:39,477 --> 00:53:40,980
Okay.
Good.

451
00:53:42,213 --> 00:53:44,656
Jay,
listen.

452
00:53:44,682 --> 00:53:46,378
Wherever you are?

453
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:49,268
If someone walking
straight towards you.

454
00:53:49,444 --> 00:53:51,210
But it is walking.

455
00:53:51,735 --> 00:53:54,949
If you try falling off.
You could buy yourself some time, I think.

456
00:53:54,974 --> 00:53:57,816
Decide if you want to give to someone else.

457
00:54:09,462 --> 00:54:11,578
Um.
Greg?

458
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:14,185
Yeah.

459
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:17,098
Your mom is not going to freak out?

460
00:54:18,202 --> 00:54:20,115
She won't even know.

461
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:25,691
It's really nice of you.

462
00:54:26,621 --> 00:54:28,485
I love coming up here.

463
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,836
My dad,
he uh...

464
00:54:32,104 --> 00:54:34,741
He used to take me hunting
a couple of times a year.

465
00:54:36,052 --> 00:54:38,433
It's not like super nice,
but..

466
00:54:39,118 --> 00:54:40,553
It's cool.

467
00:54:50,877 --> 00:54:53,166
Have you thought about what he said?

468
00:54:54,198 --> 00:54:55,385
What?

469
00:54:57,843 --> 00:54:59,945
Maybe passing it on?

470
00:55:03,247 --> 00:55:04,708
I don't know.

471
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:33,918
Still like sticking around when
everyone is going home?

472
00:57:35,056 --> 00:57:36,638
It's been lonely.

473
00:57:40,802 --> 00:57:42,886
I'm right across the street you know.

474
00:57:43,974 --> 00:57:45,433
I remember.

475
00:57:49,506 --> 00:57:51,921
I guess I should've been nicer to you.

476
00:59:06,939 --> 00:59:08,939
You guys should get into the water.

477
00:59:13,252 --> 00:59:14,582
You want to?

478
00:59:15,028 --> 00:59:16,515
Maybe a little bit.

479
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,622
Come on.

480
00:59:24,101 --> 00:59:26,897
Oh. Oh my God!
Help me.

481
00:59:27,032 --> 00:59:28,460
Jay,
what is it?

482
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:29,923
Please help!

483
00:59:31,759 --> 00:59:32,892
Help me!

484
01:00:02,207 --> 01:00:03,619
What are you doing?

485
01:00:13,103 --> 01:00:14,635
Jay,
please!

486
01:00:16,331 --> 01:00:17,846
Stop shooting!

487
01:00:53,922 --> 01:00:56,184
- What the hell are you guys doing?
- Don't open the door.

488
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,561
What did you do to the door?
We didn't do that.

489
01:00:57,586 --> 01:00:58,935
It's trying to come in.

490
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,259
There's nothing out here.

491
01:01:00,284 --> 01:01:01,416
Yes, there is.

492
01:01:01,441 --> 01:01:02,892
Fucking son of a...

493
01:01:06,657 --> 01:01:07,892
Greg?

494
01:01:22,285 --> 01:01:24,118
Greg,
are you okay?

495
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:29,322
Greg?

496
01:01:37,522 --> 01:01:39,504
Jay,
what do you see?

497
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:10,989
Wait!
Jay, wait!

498
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:13,113
Where the hell is my fucking car?

499
01:07:14,696 --> 01:07:16,493
Have you seen it?

500
01:07:17,294 --> 01:07:18,710
Nothing.

501
01:07:20,424 --> 01:07:23,408
I'm waiting,
looking.

502
01:07:24,084 --> 01:07:26,971
It's been 3 days.
I don't think it's coming.

503
01:07:27,797 --> 01:07:29,533
You believe me,
right?

504
01:07:30,163 --> 01:07:31,951
Not just playing along?

505
01:07:32,158 --> 01:07:34,894
No, I... I...I believe you.
I just...

506
01:07:35,512 --> 01:07:37,845
I just don't think it's following me.

507
01:07:38,552 --> 01:07:40,165
Isn't that a good thing?

508
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:42,218
Yeah.

509
01:08:30,421 --> 01:08:31,497
Hey.

510
01:08:32,216 --> 01:08:33,704
How are you guys?

511
01:08:33,967 --> 01:08:34,982
Okay.

512
01:08:36,019 --> 01:08:38,290
How's uh...
How's Jay?

513
01:08:38,591 --> 01:08:39,978
Not great.

514
01:08:43,877 --> 01:08:45,276
You seen anything?

515
01:08:45,982 --> 01:08:47,071
No.

516
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,101
Is it...
Is it cool if I go in?

517
01:08:49,185 --> 01:08:50,681
I don't think so.

518
01:08:50,936 --> 01:08:52,618
She doesn't want
to open her door.

519
01:08:53,232 --> 01:08:55,396
She is just hiding in there.

520
01:08:55,641 --> 01:08:57,931
Glad she's doing better.

521
01:08:59,789 --> 01:09:01,932
I can have her call you later.

522
01:09:02,035 --> 01:09:03,174
Yeah.

523
01:09:03,893 --> 01:09:05,115
Okay.

524
01:09:05,268 --> 01:09:07,873
You really haven't seen anything?

525
01:09:08,482 --> 01:09:09,593
Nope.

526
01:09:09,693 --> 01:09:11,542
She didn't make it up.

527
01:09:12,337 --> 01:09:14,443
I'll know sooner or later
right?

528
01:09:15,549 --> 01:09:17,665
That chair broke in mid air.

529
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:21,582
I mean something knocked me over and
the door didn't break on it own.

530
01:09:21,607 --> 01:09:25,730
Look, something happened,
But it's not what she thinks. Okay.

531
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:28,576
What do you think it was then?

532
01:09:32,304 --> 01:09:33,926
I'll see you guys.

533
01:09:34,398 --> 01:09:36,492
- Bye, Greg.
- Bye.

534
01:11:25,669 --> 01:11:27,510
Hi, this is Greg.
Leave a message.

535
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:46,751
Greg!
Open the door, Greg!

536
01:11:58,139 --> 01:11:59,659
Greg,
watch out!

537
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:16,799
Greg, don't open the door!

538
01:12:17,717 --> 01:12:19,378
What the fuck,
Mom.

539
01:16:42,029 --> 01:16:43,368
Who is it?

540
01:16:43,567 --> 01:16:44,729
Paul.

541
01:16:48,369 --> 01:16:49,761
Hang on.

542
01:17:27,816 --> 01:17:30,038
It's going to be here
soon or later.

543
01:17:33,174 --> 01:17:35,152
You could
pass it on.

544
01:17:37,713 --> 01:17:39,250
You did once.

545
01:17:39,699 --> 01:17:41,121
Shouldn't have.

546
01:17:43,136 --> 01:17:44,613
I could.

547
01:17:45,854 --> 01:17:46,967
No.

548
01:17:48,551 --> 01:17:50,612
I like you too.
You know.

549
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:55,386
Why you picked Greg?

550
01:17:56,527 --> 01:17:58,725
I thought he'll be okay.

551
01:18:02,230 --> 01:18:04,207
He wasn't scared.

552
01:18:07,559 --> 01:18:10,512
He said to go to high school
wasn't a bigh deal.

553
01:18:38,848 --> 01:18:40,878
I want to help.

554
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:42,953
Do you?

555
01:18:44,222 --> 01:18:46,337
Yeah.
I do.

556
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:18,581
Jay?

557
01:19:18,993 --> 01:19:20,248
Yeah?

558
01:19:21,362 --> 01:19:23,094
Do you trust me?

559
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:30,398
Do you remember where we were.
The first time we kissed.

560
01:19:46,772 --> 01:19:47,943
You know where to go?

561
01:19:47,968 --> 01:19:50,175
I know how to go
there, you'll see.

562
01:19:52,692 --> 01:19:55,219
I haven't been to the pool
since I was 14.

563
01:19:55,806 --> 01:19:57,917
Who brought you there?

564
01:19:58,634 --> 01:19:59,663
Okay.

565
01:19:59,905 --> 01:20:03,624
That's where I had my first beer.
I threw up the whole night.

566
01:20:03,664 --> 01:20:06,648
- In the pool?
- No, outside the car.

567
01:20:06,683 --> 01:20:07,988
And in the car.

568
01:20:08,497 --> 01:20:09,852
Paul used to pee in it.

569
01:20:09,877 --> 01:20:11,423
Eww...
It's disgusting.

570
01:20:11,448 --> 01:20:13,934
Whatever.
There is chlorine.

571
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:01,055
When I was a little girl.

572
01:21:01,325 --> 01:21:04,036
My parents wouldn't allow me
to go south of 8th mile.

573
01:21:05,105 --> 01:21:08,001
And I didn't even know what that meant,
until I got a little older.

574
01:21:08,127 --> 01:21:10,375
And I started realizing that.

575
01:21:10,411 --> 01:21:13,392
That's where the city started and
the suburd ended.

576
01:21:14,311 --> 01:21:17,752
And I used to think about
how shitty and weird that was.

577
01:21:18,286 --> 01:21:19,168
I mean.

578
01:21:19,193 --> 01:21:22,113
I had to ask permission
to go to the state fair

579
01:21:22,114 --> 01:21:24,364
with my best friend and her parents.

580
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:27,957
Only because it was a few
blocks past the border.

581
01:21:28,187 --> 01:21:30,375
My mom said the same thing.

582
01:22:23,384 --> 01:22:25,400
How long do you think it'll be?

583
01:22:28,609 --> 01:22:30,109
I don't know.

584
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:32,564
Are you always that bad.

585
01:26:26,952 --> 01:26:28,591
Oh my God.

586
01:26:29,815 --> 01:26:31,837
It just walked into the room.
It's right there.

587
01:26:31,862 --> 01:26:33,074
It's here?

588
01:26:33,424 --> 01:26:34,582
Right there!

589
01:26:34,987 --> 01:26:37,606
Jay,
what do you see?

590
01:26:38,462 --> 01:26:40,454
I don't want to tell you.

591
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:43,071
Jay, I need you to point at it.
Okay.

592
01:26:43,155 --> 01:26:45,827
Keep your finger aim at it
so we can see where it is.

593
01:26:50,387 --> 01:26:52,475
Is it getting in the water?

594
01:26:54,613 --> 01:26:57,322
It's just standing there,
staring at me.

595
01:26:58,317 --> 01:26:59,740
It's moving.

596
01:26:59,784 --> 01:27:01,193
What's it doing?

597
01:27:01,218 --> 01:27:03,079
It's walking.
It's just walking.

598
01:27:04,372 --> 01:27:06,912
- Paul, I want to get out.
- Not, just wait for it to get in.

599
01:27:06,937 --> 01:27:08,981
No, I don't want to do this,
I just want to get out!

600
01:27:09,006 --> 01:27:10,627
- What the fuck?
- Jay!

601
01:27:10,652 --> 01:27:11,911
Out out of there!

602
01:27:12,749 --> 01:27:14,686
She's going to get electrocuted.

603
01:27:14,888 --> 01:27:16,345
No, it didn't working.

604
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:18,073
- You okay?
- Yeah.

605
01:27:18,098 --> 01:27:20,218
- Didn't work.
- Thank god.

606
01:27:23,103 --> 01:27:24,691
Jay,
look out!

607
01:27:25,642 --> 01:27:28,428
- Oh my god, somebody help her.
- What do we do?

608
01:27:44,987 --> 01:27:47,064
What the hell is going on?

609
01:28:02,948 --> 01:28:04,892
Jay,
keep pointing at it.

610
01:28:12,093 --> 01:28:13,788
It's right there.

611
01:28:16,736 --> 01:28:18,218
Where is it?

612
01:28:20,014 --> 01:28:21,730
Watch out,
don't get too close!

613
01:28:21,824 --> 01:28:23,520
It's right there.

614
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:27,195
Yara!

615
01:28:35,127 --> 01:28:36,322
Where?

616
01:28:36,846 --> 01:28:37,967
Here?

617
01:28:39,148 --> 01:28:40,674
- Here?
- Right there.

618
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:52,213
Where is it?

619
01:29:04,737 --> 01:29:06,830
Jay!
Come on, Jay!

620
01:29:08,745 --> 01:29:10,966
- Give me your hand!
- Come on, come on, come on!

621
01:29:12,959 --> 01:29:14,103
Jay!

622
01:30:01,253 --> 01:30:02,547
Jay.

623
01:30:03,879 --> 01:30:05,358
Do you see it?

624
01:30:05,383 --> 01:30:07,224
Is it still down there?

625
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:46,462
Do you feel any different?

626
01:33:02,589 --> 01:33:04,257
Do you?

627
01:33:10,381 --> 01:33:11,655
No.

628
01:34:05,672 --> 01:34:09,249
<i>"When there is torture, there
is pain and wounds,</i>

629
01:34:09,274 --> 01:34:14,408
<i>physical agony, and all this
distracts the mind from mental suffering,</i>

630
01:34:14,506 --> 01:34:19,376
<i>so that one is tormented only by
the wounds until the moment of death.</i>

631
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:25,898
<i>But the most terrible agony may not be
in the wounds themselves,</i>

632
01:34:26,044 --> 01:34:29,744
<i>but in knowing for certain
that within an hour,</i>

633
01:34:30,093 --> 01:34:34,318
<i>then within ten minutes,
then within half a minute,</i>

634
01:34:34,566 --> 01:34:37,803
<i>now at this very instant –</i>

635
01:34:38,093 --> 01:34:40,112
<i>your soul will leave your body,</i>

636
01:34:40,213 --> 01:34:43,142
<i>and you will no longer be a person,</i>

637
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:45,833
<i>and that is certain;</i>

638
01:34:46,011 --> 01:34:50,639
<i>the worst thing is that it is certain.”</i>
