when everyone around me had turned to meat?

11
00:01:09,524 --> 00:01:11,483
<I>It's because of my list of rules.

<I>Rule number-1 for survival in Zombie land...
is "Cardio".

00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:14,827
- No, of course, of course.
- Thank you.

148
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:20,946
<I>Set aside the feverish homeless cannibal
I'm living in the dream.

149
00:15:21,743 --> 00:15:26,324
-I've had always my whole life
wanted to brush a girl's hair over her ear.

150
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:29,262
-Goodnight.

151
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:45,898
-Oh my god.

152
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:47,693
-Are you okay?

153
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:55,665
-Okay okay okay.
Stop stop stop.

154
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:56,872
-What're you doing?

155
00:16:03,883 --> 00:16:07,173
-Look, stay back 406, okay?
I don’t want to hurt you, but..

156
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,134
-Shit.

157
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,075
Oh my god.
I'm so fucking sorry.

158
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,471
-You see, you just can't trust anyone.

159
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:05,006
<I>The first girl I let into my life
and she tries to eat me.

160
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,420
-Listen to me, 406.

161
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:30,274
-If you're in there..
You're just sick, okay?

162
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:44,330
<I>"Rule number-2: Double Tap"

163
00:17:45,752 --> 00:17:48,796
<I>That was my first brush,
with the plaque of the 21st century.

164
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:54,111
<I>Remember mad cow disease? Well 'Mad cow'
became 'mad person' became 'mad zombie'.

165
00:17:54,456 --> 00:18:00,113
<I>It's a fast acting virus, that left you with a swollen
brain, raging fever and make you hateful, violent.

166
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,235
<I>And give you really really bad
case of the munchies

167
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:05,482
-Alright, you steer, I'll push.

168
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,484
-Okay.

169
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:16,806
- I've heard there's a place untouched by all this crap?
- Back east, yeah.

170
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,282
-Yeah, you heard the same thing?

171
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:22,704
-Out west we hear, back east..back east
hear it's here out west.

172
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:25,234
-And it's all just nonsense.

173
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:31,165
-You know, you're like a penguin on the north pole,
hear the south pole is really nice this time of year.

174
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,679
-There are no penguins
on the north pole.

175
00:18:35,374 --> 00:18:37,570
-You want to feel how hard
I can punch?

176
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:42,936
- So, what do you think?
- You mean, the last time I laid some pipe?

177
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:47,776
-The last time you went 22's?
The Percy in the playpen..

178
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:50,815
- It's personal.
- Wallpapered the closet, passed the gravy.

179
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:53,708
- Went heels to Jesus.
- Oh, make loves.

180
00:18:53,709 --> 00:18:56,183
-Well, it's just, sex.

181
00:18:56,183 --> 00:19:02,448
-Uhm.. Three weeks ago, yeah.
In the back of an abandoned FedEx truck.

182
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:06,833
- Shut, up.
- No, no, I was headed east..

183
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:08,790
-She uh, west.

184
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:13,302
-And we took shelter in the back of the truck.
It was full of undelivered packages.

185
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:14,972
-What was her name?

186
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:15,893
-Beverly.

187
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:18,867
- Beverly Hills.
- You dog.

188
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,697
- So uh, what about you?
- Me?

189
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:29,345
-I... I... Ai yai yai.

190
00:19:32,377 --> 00:19:34,827
-Oh my god.
That's extra sick.

191
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:39,645
-It'll makes you sad, it makes you..
makes you think you could go back

192
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,593
-To the way things were right now,
you know, you'd be...

193
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:46,554
-You'd be out in the backyard,
you know, trying to catch a fireflies.

194
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:48,393
-and instead of this.

195
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,688
- I mean it makes you...
- Hungry.

196
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:55,931
- I'm worried about you.

197
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:59,618
- Look, whatever you have waiting' for
you in Columbus, I'll promise you

198
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:03,460
-It isn’t be any pretty than our
friend here enjoying her man-which.

199
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,204
<I>Tallahassee had a sixth sense of humour
when it came to zombies.

200
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:17,123
<I>Zombies aren't the most loveable creature
but he really hated them.

201
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:21,352
<I>In fact the only thing he was more obsessed
to than killing a zombie was finding a Twinkie.

202
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:24,800
<I>Something about the Twinkie reminded
him about, time not so long ago.

203
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:28,011
<I>When things were simple
and not so fucking psychotic.

204
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:31,934
<I>It was like if he got a taste of
that comforting childhood treat,

205
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:35,477
<I>the world would become innocent again
and everything would return to normal.

206
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:37,547
-Pretty prospecting.

207
00:20:38,593 --> 00:20:42,033
-Jesus Christ.
You're a dangerous man.

208
00:20:43,095 --> 00:20:45,565
-You're going to risk our lives
for a Twinkie?

209
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:48,851
-There's a boxes of Twinkies
in that grocery store.

210
00:20:49,297 --> 00:20:50,966
-Not just any box of Twinkie.

211
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:55,845
-The last box of Twinkie that anyone
will enjoy in the whole universe.

212
00:20:56,073 --> 00:20:59,013
-Believe it or not,
Twinkie have an expiration day.

213
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:05,929
-Someday very soon, life's little
Twinkle gauge is going to go empty.

214
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:08,536
-Time to nut up or shut up!

215
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:15,732
<I>When Tallahassee goes Hulk on a zombie,
he set the standard for not to be fucked with.

216
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:19,057
<I>No fear,
nothing to lose.

217
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:21,290
<I>What can I say, it's like,
it's like art.

218
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,892
-You got a Purdy mouth!

219
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:52,243
-Don't swing,
don't swing.

220
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:53,672
-Swing.

221
00:21:59,202 --> 00:22:01,372
- Thank you.
- You owe me.

222
00:22:04,848 --> 00:22:06,668
- You're great one.
- I know.

223
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:09,841
-Twinkie, Twinkie,
Twinkie, Twinkie.

224
00:22:11,715 --> 00:22:13,053
-Oh, big hoses.

225
00:22:19,478 --> 00:22:22,116
-Come here big fells,
just going to take a little off the top.

226
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:34,086
- Wow, these fells really let themselves go.
- And they're so fat.

227
00:22:34,622 --> 00:22:36,618
Uh, I think we should
probably just keep going.

228
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:42,542
<I>All I could think of was
"What are the odds?".

229
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,482
<I>Another marriageable women to
bring home to the folks.

230
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:47,287
-Come quick.

231
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:51,330
<I>Someone's ear is in danger
of having hair brushed over it.

232
00:22:55,716 --> 00:22:56,822
-I'll catch up later.

233

<I>"Rule number-22: When in Doubt,
Know Your Way Out"

234
00:23:12,646 --> 00:23:17,883
-They're sisters. The little one's been bit.
Act normal, try not to freak her out.

235
00:23:20,481 --> 00:23:23,364
-Columbus.
Wichita, Little Rock.

236
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:29,474
- So, you did all this for a Twinkie?
- Oh, no no no no, he did.

237
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,814
-I'm just kind of like a
Rancho Penza character.

238
00:23:35,528 --> 00:23:39,107
- Um, I don't think she has long to live.
- I know, so does she.

239
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:40,717
-We're just looking for a way out.

240
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:46,560
- No no no no, she's still a little girl.
- Don't talk about me like I'm not here.

241
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:53,199
-Alright, I'm sorry. Look, I know,
you know that you're really sick.

242
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,177
- But uh, your sister wants me to..
- It's not her decision

243
00:23:58,179 --> 00:23:59,423
-It's mine.

244
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:01,238
-I made a promise.

245
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:05,999
-We already said goodbye,
but we didn't have a gun.

246
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:08,004
-Oh look, we don't know
that there's definitely no cure right?

247
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:09,628
-You're just gut-less.

248
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:11,812
-Give him the gun.

249
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:29,985
-Wait, wait.

250
00:24:33,474 --> 00:24:34,396
-I'll do it.

251
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:53,038
- I love you.
- I love you too.

252
00:25:03,896 --> 00:25:05,392
-You need some help?

253
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,014
-Now that you mention it.

254
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:10,391
-We'll take your weapons, your car key,
your ammunitions.

255
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:11,996
-And if you got it,
sugarless gum.

256
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:13,657
-What the fuck.

257
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:16,827
-Waa.. Wait, why are
you guys doing it?

258
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:21,424
-Well, better you make the mistake of trusting us,
than we make the mistake of trusting you.

259
00:25:24,363 --> 00:25:29,276
-Of course the first hot girl in a thousand miles shows up,
makes me feels like an idiot, steals my double barrow

260
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,693
-and says I'm the one that can't be trusted.

261
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:39,544
-Nice going genius.
You're the one that gave her the gun.

262
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:41,973
-Those guys were dumb.

263
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:48,985
- Avoid the vanity mirror.
- Relax ok, I just passed for a zombie.

264
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:55,073
- What I'd give for a show...
- Do not say the S-H-O-W-E-R, okay?

265
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:56,533
-Just get the rule going.

266
00:25:57,232 --> 00:25:59,682
- So, do you think it's true?
- Is what true?

267
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:03,378
- Rumours about Pacific Play land.
- Totally zombie-free. Only places way to go.

268
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:08,611
-Trust me.

269
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:16,639

bikes, you know with the, like the toeholds, right

270
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:20,779
-And uh, he's peddling. And the zombies
head is like caught in the gear.

271
00:26:21,766 --> 00:26:24,768
-You know with the hair and the
chain just like, going around.

272
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:26,227
-Very cool.

273
00:26:26,228 --> 00:26:27,826
- Yeah.
- But..

274
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:31,553
-Zombie-kill of the week.. no sir.

275
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,937
-I saw this construction worker
I shit you not.

276
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:39,710
-He's on the steam roller and the
zombie goes down in front of me..

277
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,659
-Ever roll a tube of tooth paste
up from the bottom?

278
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:45,997
- Yeah. I always rolled up from bottom to top.
- Yeah, zombie's head is the cap.

279
00:26:46,008 --> 00:26:48,866
-Do you know this guy who's trying
to like.. to be in everyone's story?

280
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:53,217
-No. I knew who got away
worse than that to me.

281
00:26:53,861 --> 00:26:57,575
- I just try to find their car.
- Which would remind me..

282
00:26:57,575 --> 00:27:00,377
-I never had headaches like this
'til your ass came on board.

283
00:27:00,377 --> 00:27:04,201
-Do what you want with a man,
but do not fuck with his Cadillac.

284
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:07,678
- Hey, this is a nice mini-van.
- Yes, it is nice.

285
00:27:08,516 --> 00:27:10,135
That's a beautiful van.

286
00:27:11,694 --> 00:27:15,335
-Tallahassee firmly believe that you have
to blow off steam in Zombie land

287
00:27:15,335 --> 00:27:17,990
-or else you'll lose what's left of your mind.

288
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:20,569
-Well, if it makes him happy and keeps
him from using that crowbar on me,

289
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,047
-Then I say "Hey, go waste shit".

290
00:27:23,436 --> 00:27:25,945
-I want my Caddy back.

291
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,662
-Stupid little bitches.

292
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:38,170
-Oh, I think I pulled something.

293
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:43,387
-You think there's two of us smart enough
to come home with a car like that?

294
00:27:46,775 --> 00:27:48,528
-You hesitated.

295
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:54,429
-Would you rather be
smart or lucky?

296
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:57,356
-Look at what we got here.

297
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,998
- It's nice.
- Small finger.

298
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:32,986
<I>"Rule number-31: Check The Back Seat"

299
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:39,336
-Thank God for rednecks.

300
00:28:40,203 --> 00:28:46,723
-This is a really big truck,
and these are really big gun.

301
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,386
-Take your time.

302
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:15,933
-You know they say "He who seeks revenge
should remember to dig two graves".

303
00:29:15,933 --> 00:29:17,499
-Alright, two graves.

304
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:20,010
-One for the big chick,
one for the little chick.

305
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,795
-You're scary happy.

306
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,023
-Come on, why don't we just forget
about those girls and head home.

307
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,619
-So you want to talk about home?

308
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:34,474
-To me home was a,
puppy name Buck.

309
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,056
-Cutest dog ever.

310
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:46,658
-Cause of those fucking zombies...

311
00:29:47,979 --> 00:29:49,252
-I lost him.

312
00:29:49,768 --> 00:29:52,142
-There isn’t no getting him back, so uh...

313
00:29:52,939 --> 00:29:54,743
-I'm looking for a new home.

314
00:29:55,857 --> 00:30:00,650
-Tomorrow maybe, skinny dip
in a Yellowstone River.

315
00:30:00,904 --> 00:30:04,553
-Swinging from the chandeliers
in a Playboy mansion, but today,

316
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:11,621
-A Vortex 6 fucking litre V8. A box
full of hollow points and a Lord willing' and GD Twinkie.

317
00:30:13,232 --> 00:30:15,414
-Got to enjoy the little things.

318
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:20,284
<I>I hate to give credit to anyone
who looks like Yosemite Sam,

319
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,725
<I>but I'm writing it down.

320
00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:25,304
<I>Rule number-32
Enjoy the little things

321
00:30:31,795 --> 00:30:34,817
- Going in, it's a trap.

322
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:36,187
-Wait here.

323
00:30:36,188 --> 00:30:37,148
-Drive down if I signal.

324
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,856
- You're not going to shoot them, are you?

325
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,087
- Unless the shoot me.

326
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:45,352
-Oh, let's hope they shoot me.

327
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,040
-Looks like they hoofed it.

328
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:38,579
-Probably headed west.

329
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:41,777
-Just drive slow, keep your eyes peeled.

330
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,920
-They're in the back, aren't they?

331
00:31:48,238 --> 00:31:49,799
- Just me.

332
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,544
- I'm really sorry.
She was like a crouching tiger.

333
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:56,431
- You got taken hostage by a twelve year old?

334
00:31:56,717 --> 00:31:58,455
-Well, girls mature faster than boys.

335
00:31:58,456 --> 00:32:00,472
-She is way ahead of where I was at that age.

336
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:02,953
- Twelve's the new twenty. Gun please.

337
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,642
- Like you would ever use it..

338
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:08,235
-Don't kill me with my own gun.

339
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:10,589
- All those violent video games.

340
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,933
- Thank you.

341
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,179
-Now honk your horn.
- What?

342
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,140
- Honk it.

343
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,860
- Oh, there's your sister, that's my gun.

344
00:32:21,861 --> 00:32:22,821
-Hello.

345
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,821
- Bummer.

346
00:32:29,472 --> 00:32:32,355
-Now step away from the vehicle.

347
00:32:33,472 --> 00:32:35,355
-You get to ride shotgun

348
00:32:43,303 --> 00:32:44,578
<I>I kind of like this girl.

349
00:32:44,925 --> 00:32:47,245
<I>She's not your typical hot,
stuck up bitch.

350
00:32:49,046 --> 00:32:52,079
<I>Even before Zombie land, Wichita was
running the table on guys like us.

351
00:33:07,074 --> 00:33:08,166
- What are you looking for?

352
00:33:07,842 --> 00:33:09,706
- My engagement ring.

353
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:15,163
- I took it off to pump my gas
and I thought I had it in my purse,

354
00:33:15,164 --> 00:33:16,604
-but it must've fallen out.

355
00:33:16,726 --> 00:33:18,819
-And I'm late for my flight..

356
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:21,809
- Listen, I'll find your ring
and I'll FedEx it to you.

357
00:33:22,386 --> 00:33:23,730
- I'll give you a reward

358
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:25,267
- Do not be silly.

359
00:33:25,268 --> 00:33:26,228
- Three-thousand dollars.

360
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:29,481
-It's worth more than my car.

361
00:33:30,432 --> 00:33:32,020
- Just, just give me your number.

362
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:35,210
-I'll find it.

363
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:37,323
-Yeah I'll start looking for it right now.

364
00:33:37,324 --> 00:33:38,764
-Cause I got nothing else to do.

365
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:41,950
-I was engaged once,

366
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:43,391
-but I'm single now.

367
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:47,743
-Bye

368
00:33:50,432 --> 00:33:51,872
-Hope you make your flight.

369
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,172
-I know it's around here somewhere,
she's on a plane, that's the beauty of it.

370
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,115
-Let me call you back.

371
00:34:07,663 --> 00:34:09,450
Hey, you found my ring.

372
00:34:10,903 --> 00:34:13,022
-Thanks, I've been looking all over for it.

373
00:34:12,964 --> 00:34:14,705
- Your ring?
- It was my friend's.

374
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,851
-I'm going to send it to her.
- Do I get a reward?

375
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:25,032
- 40, 60, 80,
400, That's it. That's the whole register.

376
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:30,379
-You made someone very happy.

377
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:32,295
- You too.

378
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:45,071
- How many left?
- Let me see.

379
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:50,159
-Enough for us to get to California.

380
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,040
-Someday I want a ring this big.

381
00:34:52,561 --> 00:34:55,441
- For the low price of 30 bucks, sold.

382
00:34:57,578 --> 00:35:01,267
<I>It's amazing how far you can get with some
costume jewellery and a cut-throat attitude.

383
00:35:02,161 --> 00:35:04,924
<I>I guess we're just lucky they
didn't leave us by the side of the road.

384
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,752
- Thank you Wichita,
Thanks Little Rock.

385
00:35:14,638 --> 00:35:17,410
- Hey for fuck's sake, enough already, we're being chased by ravenous freaks.

386
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,724
-We don't have enough problems?

387
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:22,125
-"Oh, they stole my Hummer",
"We have trust issues".

388
00:35:22,126 --> 00:35:25,198
-Now get over it, okay, we can't just fucking
drive down the road playing I-spy,

389
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,887
-or some shit for two hours,
like four normal-ass Americans?

390
00:35:27,888 --> 00:35:29,232
-Fuck me!

391
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:31,753
-I know

392
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,594
-Let me be the mature one.

393
00:35:48,727 --> 00:35:49,860
- So

394
00:35:50,132 --> 00:35:51,239
-Where are you guys headed.

395
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:53,325
- "Pacific Play land"

396
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:55,054
- The amusement park?

397
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:56,207
- Wait, outside LA?

398
00:35:56,605 --> 00:35:57,932
- Yeah, we went there as kids.

399
00:35:59,007 --> 00:36:00,838
- That place totally blows..

400
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:07,761
-my mind. It's so fun. Just good
entertainment for the whole family.

401
00:36:08,085 --> 00:36:12,057
- Yeah actually I went there as a kid too.
In fact this probably counts as off season.

402
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:15,041
- Well, did you guys hear?
There are no zombies there

403
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:16,194
- Yeah, we heard.

404
00:36:16,195 --> 00:36:18,019
-You know what, I may not shoot you,

405
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,187
-but you still royally piss me off.

406
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:24,452
-And I'm not going to play
with you at Pacific Play land.

407
00:36:26,313 --> 00:36:29,244
- Don't worry he grows on you.
- Really?

408
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:31,453
- No, it's worse.
- Okay.

409
00:36:30,885 --> 00:36:33,263
-How about we play the quiet game?

410
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,871
-Yeah? Starting now.

411
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:41,837
- Oh, I've actually been meaning to ask you.
Did you hear anything about Columbus, Ohio?

412
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:43,757
- You've heard of the quiet game?
- Sorry.

413
00:36:43,765 --> 00:36:45,911
-No? Well they're playing
it in Columbus, Ohio.

414
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:48,543
-It's a total ghost town,
burned to the ground.

415
00:36:57,855 --> 00:36:59,103
- You're Columbus.

416
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,600
-I'm sorry.

417
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:03,329
-I didn't realize it was..

418
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:06,808
<I>I'm not sure what's more tragic,

419
00:37:07,206 --> 00:37:08,618
<I>That my family is gone,

420
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:12,267
<I>or the realization that I had
never much of a family to begin with.

421
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:14,339
<I>Either way I can't pretend
that whatever I'm looking for,

422
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,972
<I>I'll find by going home.

423
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,631
<I>I have no home.

424
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:21,314
- We can,

425
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:24,675
-give you a ride.

426
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:28,490
-You can go, see for yourself, or settle somewhere new.

427
00:37:33,758 --> 00:37:36,207
<I>I could tell she knew what I was feeling.

428
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:38,607
<I>We are all orphans in Zombie land.

429
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:54,351
-I know this Pacific Play land thing is nuts,

430
00:37:55,216 --> 00:37:56,752
-but,

431
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,633
it's been so long since she got to be a kid.

432
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:03,205
- It's tough growing up in Zombie land.
- It's tough growing up.

433
00:38:12,037 --> 00:38:14,149
-There, you can take that truck.

434
00:38:18,758 --> 00:38:20,870
-Well, I,

435
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:23,505
-hope you find whoever it is you're looking for.

436
00:38:25,115 --> 00:38:28,148
-And don't let go, once you do.

437
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,248
<I>It wasn't just because I had nowhere else to go.

438
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:46,439
<I>It was cause in that moment it became clear.

439
00:38:47,537 --> 00:38:48,960
<I>Wherever this girl was,

440
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:51,287
<I>that's wherein wanted to be.

441
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:13,367
- Man we're going to have to pull over soon.
I'm feeling cooped up.

442
00:39:14,328 --> 00:39:17,399
-Wantamiro Wampum, Yeah that'll work.

443
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,128
- Okay but what the hell are we doing?

444
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:21,433
- Just humour him, trust me.

445
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:35,359
- Hold on.

446
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,279
- Who wants to go first?

447
00:39:38,144 --> 00:39:40,448
I really, really want to impress Wichita,

448
00:39:41,696 --> 00:39:45,152
<I>but it would be a direct violation of Rule #17,
maybe the most important of all,

449
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:47,073
<I>Don't be hero.

450
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:48,620
- Why don't you take this one.

451
00:39:48,716 --> 00:39:50,060
- Don't mind if I do.

452
00:40:04,351 --> 00:40:07,065
What do you think? Zombie kill of the week?

453
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:08,882
<I>Close, but no cigar.

454
00:40:09,332 --> 00:40:12,620
<I>Zombie kill of the week goes
to sister Cynthia Knickerbockers.

455
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:19,374
<I>Poor flat bastard.

456
00:40:40,373 --> 00:40:41,774
- Perfume?
- What?

457
00:40:42,522 --> 00:40:43,927
- Is that perfume?

458
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:47,147
- It's cologne.

459
00:40:47,396 --> 00:40:49,193
- I'm thinking:

460
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:51,017
"Lance Magnifique"

461
00:40:51,018 --> 00:40:53,898
- Why don't you speak up,
they might've missed it in Santa fee.

462
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:03,948
- Oh my God.
You're thinking about fucking Wichita.

463
00:41:05,058 --> 00:41:08,411
Wish granted. She spent the
last 24 hours fucking us both.

464
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:14,843
Good luck now Petunia.

465
00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:24,711
- Ok, let me begin my three-part apology by saying

466
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:27,038
that I think you're a wonderful
human with great potential..

467
00:41:27,038 --> 00:41:32,059
- FYI, I beat wholesale ass
for a lot less than that.

468
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:37,046
- I'm sure
- You get 45% power.

469
00:41:37,046 --> 00:41:37,893
- Thank you.

470
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:41,693
Come on, break another one.

471
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:46,707
Nice.

472
00:41:50,773 --> 00:41:52,244
Doesn't that feel good.

473
00:42:39,378 --> 00:42:42,642
<I>Sometimes Tallahassee's right.
You got to enjoy the little things.

474
00:42:42,778 --> 00:42:45,469
<I>Even if that means destroying
a whole lot of little things.

475
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,038
- What smells like perfume?

476
00:42:54,302 --> 00:42:56,318
- You don't know who Willie Nelson is?
- No.

477
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:01,503
- Willie Nelson.
- Yeah, no, I don't.

478
00:43:02,272 --> 00:43:04,946
- Yeah I shave every morning but sometimes

479
00:43:04,946 --> 00:43:09,088
by like 4:30 I have a thing...
(continue rambling)

480
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:13,217
- Since this is a freeway. You can get it up to 65,
but you don't want to go more than 75.

481
00:43:13,733 --> 00:43:14,936
- You don't want to go more than 20.

482
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:21,076
- Do not worry about it. Blind spots,
blind spots are for other drivers.

483
00:43:22,037 --> 00:43:26,957
- So do you never strap in or just, when on road trips?
- It's just, you know,

484
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:30,743
there's zombies everywhere.
I think the least of my worries is..

485
00:43:30,972 --> 00:43:31,654
- Yeah that's true.

486
00:43:31,655 --> 00:43:32,615
..seat belts.

487
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:35,027
- Yes but no, she's not. she's not.

488
00:43:35,027 --> 00:43:37,386
She's only famous when she's
Hannah Montana, when she's wearing the wig.

489
00:43:37,421 --> 00:43:38,684
-Okay, right.
so

490
00:43:43,677 --> 00:43:46,365
- This is kind of freeing.
- Yeah.

491
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,641
<I>For the first time in a long time,

492
00:43:51,883 --> 00:43:53,318
<I>we were having fun.

493
00:43:53,383 --> 00:43:56,103
<I>So even though it ran counter
to our survival strategies,

494
00:43:56,104 --> 00:43:58,504
<I>we decided to stay together
as far as Pacific Play land.

495
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:29,510
- You know I think sleep deprivation is like
the number one health problem in America.

496
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:32,487
No, I think it moth be number two.

497
00:44:32,488 --> 00:44:35,368
- Number two..
- That's adorable.

498
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:38,440
- I'm just saying we should find a place to crash.
- Oh, I got an idea.

499
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:40,937
We're in Hollywood, let's sleep in style.

500
00:44:47,178 --> 00:44:48,426
Grab a map.

501
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,010
- Come on.
- Hurry.

502
00:45:05,446 --> 00:45:09,159
- It seems like everyone who has
ever been in a movie lives on this block.

503
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,944
- What exactly do you think
we're doing in the 90210 Sally?

504
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:15,194
- I kind of pictured Tom Cruise
living somewhere nicer.

505
00:45:15,195 --> 00:45:18,074
- B..listed compared to who I got in mind folks.

506
00:45:19,035 --> 00:45:21,819
We are going to the Tipi Top of the A-list.

507
00:45:22,108 --> 00:45:24,412
- Who?
- You'll see.

508
00:45:30,164 --> 00:45:32,464
- Hey, here's a big BM.

509
00:45:32,465 --> 00:45:34,193
- It isn’t Bob Marley.

510
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:42,161
- This place is incredible.

511
00:45:53,201 --> 00:45:58,961
- Ladies and Gentlemen,
welcome to La Mention de Murray.

512
00:45:58,962 --> 00:46:00,594
- Oh, Bill Murray

513
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,756
- God, no way.

514
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:05,749
This guy has a direct line
to my funny bone, I mean every..

515
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,670
- Boy, who's Bill Murray?

516
00:46:07,671 --> 00:46:13,430
- I have never hit a kid before,
but I mean that's like asking who Gandhi is.

517
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:15,351
- Who's Gandhi?

518
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,272
- She's twelve.

519
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:23,032
- No Twinkies.
- Shit Bob.

520
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:26,639
- See? I told you we should've gone to
Russell Crowe's. No one listens to me.

521
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,080
- Hello, inside voices, okay?

522
00:46:28,081 --> 00:46:29,521
- At least until we know we are alone.

523
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,080
- Hey Tallahassee, Wichita
why don't you take that way.

524
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,361
-Little Rock come here.

525
00:46:33,362 --> 00:46:34,802
-Why do I get stuck with her?

526
00:46:38,643 --> 00:46:39,987
-It doesn't seem to end.

527
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:46,995
-Hey come here.

528
00:46:49,204 --> 00:46:51,796
-He has his own movie theatre?

529
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:57,461
-Ok, I'm going to teach you
a little something about Bill Murray.

530
00:46:59,669 --> 00:47:01,301
-The king slept right here.

531
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,301
-Dibs on the bed.

532
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,236
-Too soft for me anyway.

533
00:47:16,705 --> 00:47:19,645
-Oh, this is so exciting, you're about
to learn who you're going to call.

534
00:47:19,934 --> 00:47:21,182
-Ghostbusters.

535
00:47:38,462 --> 00:47:41,341
-This is pretty catchy.

536
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:48,061
-Help me with the boots, come on.
Help me with the boots.

537
00:47:49,598 --> 00:47:51,230
-Ok, I'll get  myself.

538
00:48:17,624 --> 00:48:19,174
-Bill Murray, you're a zombie?

539
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:29,318
-You're not a zombie, you're talking.

540
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:30,802
-You're okay.

541
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:35,908
- The hell I am.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know that it was you-you.

542
00:48:35,842 --> 00:48:38,003
-Are you..What's with the,
the get up?

543
00:48:38,184 --> 00:48:42,787
-Oh, I do it to blend in, you know
zombies don't mess with other zombies.

544
00:48:42,788 --> 00:48:45,188
-Buddy of mine, make-up guy,
showed how to do this.

545
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,615
-Corn starch, you know some berries,
a little liquids for the ladies.

546
00:48:48,627 --> 00:48:51,482
-It suits my lifestyle. You know I like to get out and do stuff.

547
00:48:52,077 --> 00:48:56,053
-Just played nine holes at the Riviera,
just walked on, nobody there.

548
00:48:56,342 --> 00:48:59,222
-Goddamn it,
Bill fucking Murray.

549
00:49:00,767 --> 00:49:02,974
-I had to get that out.
I don't mean to gush.

550
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:07,774
-This is so surreal, I mean. You probably
get this all the time, well, maybe not lately,

551
00:49:07,776 --> 00:49:09,771
-but I'm such a huge fan of yours.

552
00:49:09,965 --> 00:49:13,885
-I've seen everyone of your movies a million times.

553
00:49:13,886 --> 00:49:16,766
-I even love your dramatic roles, everything.

554
00:49:18,976 --> 00:49:23,071
-Six people left in the world,
one of them is Bill fucking Murray.

555
00:49:23,071 --> 00:49:24,543
-I know that's not your middle name.

556
00:49:24,543 --> 00:49:29,534
-But I've been watching you since I was like..
since I could masturbate, not that they're connected.

557
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:32,930
-You know "A former greens keeper
about to become the master champion."

558
00:49:38,653 --> 00:49:39,935
- That's why we do it.

559
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:42,732
- I love you Bill, I love you.

560
00:49:44,354 --> 00:49:45,695
- Thank you.

561
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:48,788
- You are staring at me, it's a hairpiece it's a..

562
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:52,244
- Sorry, it's just that you look remarkably like Eddy Van Helen.

563
00:49:52,245 --> 00:49:53,589
- I Just saw Eddy Van Helen.

564
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:54,934
- Really?
- Yeah.

565
00:49:55,647 --> 00:49:56,762
- Where?
- At the Hollywood bowl.

566
00:49:57,357 --> 00:49:59,138
- Well, how was it?
- He's a zombie

567
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:01,585
- That's a tough break.

568
00:50:01,616 --> 00:50:06,384
- So how about a little west coast hospitality. Can I get you something? What would you like?

569
00:50:06,616 --> 00:50:12,000
<I>[Blue Oyster Cult - Don't Fear The Reaper]

570
00:50:21,057 --> 00:50:24,376
- Oh hurry, hurry he's on the ceiling. Come get him. Oh..

571
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:28,121
- Light  up Murray.
- See you on the other side Pete.

572
00:50:29,082 --> 00:50:30,522
- You're so disgusting.

573
00:50:32,193 --> 00:50:33,816
- Don't cross the streams.

574
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:38,617
- I don't want to cross..
- Don't cross the streams!

575
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,500
- "35 feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds"
- "That's a big Twinkie"

576
00:50:45,952 --> 00:50:49,998
- Your sister's single, right? There's nothing long-distance or anything.

577
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:52,303
- No.
- Good, good.

578
00:50:53,299 --> 00:50:58,319
-And if she had, like, a type - if you can have a type - what would that be?

579
00:50:59,471 --> 00:51:01,934
- She kind of goes for, like, bad boys.

580
00:51:01,935 --> 00:51:03,087
- Really?
- Yeah.

581
00:51:03,088 --> 00:51:04,336
- That's cool.

582
00:51:08,472 --> 00:51:11,408
- So Columbus is the scared one?
- Yeah, he's like a little bunny.

583
00:51:13,288 --> 00:51:15,233
- I'll get him.

584
00:51:17,446 --> 00:51:18,527
-Watch this.

585
00:51:30,047 --> 00:51:32,735
- It's okay, it's okay. I got him.

586
00:51:36,996 --> 00:51:39,581
Is that how you say hello where you come from?

587
00:51:40,832 --> 00:51:43,941
-Oh my God, Oh my God I can't believe I shot Bill Murray.

588
00:51:46,117 --> 00:51:47,520
-Mr. Murray?

589
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:50,844
Just Bill I think now.

590
00:51:50,845 --> 00:51:51,997
- Bill?
- Yeah?

591
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:56,797
- I don't think we're going to be able to stitch this.

592
00:51:58,046 --> 00:51:59,678
- Owe, that's still tender.

593
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,523
- You think you might pull through?

594
00:52:05,203 --> 00:52:06,283
- No.

595
00:52:06,737 --> 00:52:09,044
- If it means anything now I am so sorry.

596
00:52:09,912 --> 00:52:11,217
-It was just instinctive.

597
00:52:11,747 --> 00:52:12,915
- It was my bad.

598
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,424
-I was never a very good practical joker.

599
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:18,696
- So do you have any regrets?

600
00:52:21,632 --> 00:52:23,662
-"Garfield", maybe.

601
00:52:47,662 --> 00:52:49,966
- I'm sorry, he just gets me.

602
00:52:51,694 --> 00:52:53,422
-But it still is sad.
- Yeah.

603
00:53:13,294 --> 00:53:15,694
- Sorry. One second

604
00:53:16,175 --> 00:53:17,519
-It's a double-barrel so..

605
00:53:19,055 --> 00:53:19,823
-Okay.

606
00:53:25,104 --> 00:53:27,024
-3, 2, 1.

607
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:32,785
- You guys want some caramel?
- Yes.

608
00:53:41,423 --> 00:53:42,676
- Oh Free parking, which coincidentally

609
00:53:42,965 --> 00:53:45,461
-is the best thing about Zombie land.

610
00:53:45,653 --> 00:53:48,533
- No, best thing about Z-land:
No Face book status updates.

611
00:53:48,534 --> 00:53:51,414
You know "Rob Curtis is gearing up for Friday".

612
00:53:51,527 --> 00:53:52,653
Who cares.

613
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:56,511
- The best thing is no more flushing, epic.

614
00:53:56,546 --> 00:53:58,703
- And worst thing?
About Z-land?

615
00:53:59,015 --> 00:54:01,487
- You mean other than the
fact that I shot Bill Murray?

616
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,448
- That's easy.

617
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,464
- Losing Bob.

618
00:54:04,657 --> 00:54:05,713
- That's his puppy.

619
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:11,090
- I tell you, I never thought
I could love anything like Bob

620
00:54:11,227 --> 00:54:14,598
-The day he was born I just lost my mind.

621
00:54:16,844 --> 00:54:17,910
- Sorry.

622
00:54:23,149 --> 00:54:27,368
He had my personality,
my laugh, my appetite,

623
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:32,598
<I>Laugh? And that's when it hit me.
I felt so ashamed that it had taken me this long.

624
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:37,335
<I>Me with the best cardio in the business to realize
I wasn't the only one running from something.

625
00:55:00,854 --> 00:55:03,254
- We made this wallet together
out of Duct Tape.

626
00:55:09,324 --> 00:55:13,683
<I> Take away a man's son, you've
truly given him nothing left to lose.

627
00:55:23,667 --> 00:55:27,315
- I haven't cried like that since Titanic.

628
00:56:06,389 --> 00:56:11,983
-A hint?
Why don't you exhale slowly,

629
00:56:12,676 --> 00:56:13,880
-then squeeze the trigger.

630
00:56:47,191 --> 00:56:49,303
- Don't make me drink alone.
- Okay.

631
00:56:56,504 --> 00:56:59,767
-It 1997, " Gorgeous"

632
00:57:01,304 --> 00:57:03,032
- I never took French.

633
00:57:02,457 --> 00:57:03,417
-Gorgeous day what the hell?

634
00:57:05,974 --> 00:57:07,575
- It's a 97?
- Yeah.

635
00:57:08,606 --> 00:57:10,148
- Was that a good year?
- Oh my God.

636
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,391
It was a great year, are you kidding me?,
I saw my first R- rated movie that year.

637
00:57:16,352 --> 00:57:18,464
-Anaconda.
- Oh, Anaconda.

638
00:57:21,365 --> 00:57:22,631
- First tattoo, a porpoise.

639
00:57:23,304 --> 00:57:24,648
- Really?
- Fake.

640
00:57:25,513 --> 00:57:26,665
- First kiss.

641
00:57:28,394 --> 00:57:29,834
-Scotty Lynch

642
00:57:31,803 --> 00:57:33,100
- Did you guys.. use tongue?

643
00:57:35,166 --> 00:57:36,732
- Maybe.

644
00:57:38,653 --> 00:57:41,820
- Are you jealous of Scotty Lynch?
- Yes, I am.

645
00:57:43,452 --> 00:57:46,620
- Actually I think I'm jealous of your whole 1997.

646
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,213
- Let's see mine.

647
00:57:51,646 --> 00:57:55,217
-First orthodontist. The bastard gave me head gear.

648
00:57:56,178 --> 00:57:58,290
- I got my first B.
- Oh no.

649
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:01,171
- Frightening, as Anaconda

650
00:58:02,323 --> 00:58:05,011
-Wood shop, which doesn't really count as a class anyway.

651
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:10,003
-Had my first school dance.

652
00:58:10,165 --> 00:58:12,795
-I was Sadie Hawkins..

653
00:58:13,276 --> 00:58:14,716
-girls choice.

654
00:58:17,404 --> 00:58:19,132
- What nobody picked you?

655
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,785
- Is was girls choice.

656
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,068
- Those bitches!
- I know.

657
00:58:24,029 --> 00:58:26,909
-No, I will not stand for this, you know what?

658
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:29,598
-On behalf of all the eight-grade girls,

659
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:32,862
-I would like you to make it up to you.

660
00:58:35,797 --> 00:58:36,959
Relax, Scotty's old news.

661
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,161
-I don't even know your name,
but this is actually really nice.

662
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:20,311
-You know? Between you, me and

663
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,724
-You're actually kind of cute.

664
00:59:25,252 --> 00:59:26,584
- You think so?

665
00:59:28,601 --> 00:59:32,345
- I mean you got the guts of a guppy, but

666
00:59:32,692 --> 00:59:34,156
I could hit that.

667
00:59:38,189 --> 00:59:39,629
- Really?

668
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:42,510
- I'll at least give you the intentional walk to first.

669
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:56,338
- Hey little help moving' a couch.

670

-We're making a fort.

671
01:00:04,511 --> 01:00:08,062
- That was probably for the best, cause

672
01:00:09,407 --> 01:00:12,479
I like you, Columbus,

673
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,320
but my sister and I are going to do whatever it takes to survive so..

674
01:00:27,805 --> 01:00:30,073
<I>I was hoping Wichita was just playing hard to get,

675
01:00:30,504 --> 01:00:33,507
<I>but I realized that she had more trust issues than I did.

676
01:00:33,508 --> 01:00:36,388
<I>When I woke up the next day and she was leaving.

677
01:00:40,453 --> 01:00:42,611

-developed in a secret fucking government lab.

679
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:49,538
- I can't believe I almost kissed him. What's our rule?

680
01:00:50,216 --> 01:00:53,138
- Trust no one, just you and me.
- Just you and me.

681
01:00:54,675 --> 01:00:55,827
- Yeah, you and me.

682
01:01:08,959 --> 01:01:13,100
- You have just survived the zombie apocalypse
and drove halfway across the country.

683
01:01:13,686 --> 01:01:16,949
- Where are you going to go?
- I'm going to Pacific Play land. Woo.

Open Sesame.

685

<I>This is the problem with
getting attached to someone.

686
01:01:50,588 --> 01:01:52,191
<I>When they leave you just feel lost.

687
01:01:52,847 --> 01:01:56,946
<I>Having Tallahassee around didn't comfort me,
it just made me feel more alone.

- Hey, you weren't exactly going to score anyway.

689
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
- You weren't storming' the trenches before I came along.

690
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:09,451
-That's why I don't let people close, you only get burned.

691
01:02:09,644 --> 01:02:10,508
- You don't say.

in Mexico? Los Sub merinos.

700
01:03:52,298 --> 01:03:55,724
- You can't make yourself too available.

758
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:35,295
<I>No, it had to be a clown.

759
01:14:35,816 --> 01:14:38,490
<I>And it had to be Wichita
for me to finally understand

760
01:14:38,726 --> 01:14:41,134
<I>that some rules are made to be broken.

761
01:14:45,029 --> 01:14:46,469
<I>Time to nut up or shut up.

762
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:52,674
<I>Fuck this clown.

763
01:15:35,181 --> 01:15:36,170
- Thanks.

764
01:15:36,863 --> 01:15:37,994
-Wichita

765
01:15:50,102 --> 01:15:52,755
- Christa.

766
01:16:24,155 --> 01:16:26,864
- Ok, we should probably head out, now.

767
01:16:32,084 --> 01:16:34,140
- Finally he got to first base.

768
01:16:34,621 --> 01:16:37,021
-Not bad for that scrawny little spit-fuck.

769
01:16:44,802 --> 01:16:46,475
- Where is Tallahassee

770
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,711
- I have a little hunch.

771
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,981
-Where are you spongy yellow
delicious bastards? Where are you?

772
01:17:05,608 --> 01:17:09,760
- False advertising!
- Jesus Christ.

773
01:17:11,297 --> 01:17:12,641
- You want a Snow-Ball or something?

774
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,768
- Oh God!

775
01:17:47,242 --> 01:17:49,314
-Words cannot express..

776
01:17:50,859 --> 01:17:52,201
- It's too soon.

777
01:17:52,202 --> 01:17:55,081
- Do you think you can, maybe, just pick out
the Buckshot and just kind of eat around it?

778
01:17:59,306 --> 01:18:00,362
- No!

779
01:18:01,323 --> 01:18:02,283
-No!

780
01:18:02,764 --> 01:18:03,724
- No!

781
01:18:05,932 --> 01:18:09,484
<I>That face. That's me realizing
that those smart girls

782
01:18:09,485 --> 01:18:10,925
<I>in that big black truck

783
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,895
<I>and that big guy in that snakeskin jacket

784
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:18,427
<I>they were the closest to something
I had always wanted, but never really had.

785
01:18:19,441 --> 01:18:20,927
<I>A family.

786
01:18:21,091 --> 01:18:22,951
<I>I trusted them and they trusted me.

787
01:18:27,252 --> 01:18:30,046
<I>Rule number-32
Enjoy The Little Things.

788
01:18:30,346 --> 01:18:31,959
<I>Tallahassee got his Twinkie

789
01:18:32,793 --> 01:18:35,873
<I>and even though life will never
be simple or innocent again,

790
01:18:36,804 --> 01:18:39,846
<I>as he savoured that spongy yellow log of cream,

791
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,685
<I>we had hope, we had each other.

792
01:18:43,797 --> 01:18:47,473
<I>And without other people, you might swell be a zombie.

793
01:18:48,818 --> 01:18:49,682
- Thank you so much
- You had us going.

794
01:18:55,442 --> 01:18:56,882
<I>So until next time remember:

795
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:58,480
<I>Cardio, seat belts

796
01:18:58,769 --> 01:19:02,705
<I>and this really has nothing to do with anything,
but a little sunscreen never hurt anybody.

797
01:19:04,722 --> 01:19:08,658
<I>I'm  Columbus, Ohio, from Zombie land saying:
Good night.

798
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:30,659
