1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,700
[TV News]...he's definitely got the inside track.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,800
Word is they're having some problems
with injuries.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,000
Really? Are they looking into free agent signing at
the last second or anything like that?

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,700
Possibly, I mean they have a strong farm club.
They got some AAA ball players bringing up...

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,300
But again, Peter will tell us a little bit
more in the next half hour.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,000
Who do you like?
-- So far, I like what I'm seeing in New York.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,400
They got a strong club as usual.
That is in the American, and..

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,800
and the National, I'm still liking Chicago,
with a little bit of twist here for Los Angeles.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,600
- Okay, so we're looking here at New York, Chicago
World Series, possible Los Angeles.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,700
Hey, hold it to him to the
end of the season.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,600
That's gonna do it from the sports desk for right now.
Back to you guys in the studio, thanks Dave.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,500
Thanks for nothing Eddy, thank you guys.
That's not all we're following.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,300
Here's Karen at the health desk.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,200
The world of medicine has seen its share of
miracle cures from the polio vaccine
to heart transplants.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
But all past achievements may pale
in comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,100
Thank you so much for joining us this morning.

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,600
Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,700
The premise is quite simple.
Take something designed by nature ...

19
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,900
and reprogram it to make it work for
the body rather than against it.

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,300
You're talking about a virus?
- Indeed yes, in this case, the measles.

21
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,400
A virus which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,200
I find the best way to describe it is
if you can imagine your body is a highway....

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,600
and you picked the virus as a very fast car, being
driven by a very bad man.

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Imagine the damage that car can cause.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,300
But if you replace that man with a cop,
then the picture changes.

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,800
And that is essentially what we have done.
-- And how many people have you treated so far?

27
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,600
We have 10,009 clinical trials in humans so far.
-- And how many are cancer free?

28
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,400
-- 10,009.
-- So you have actually cured cancer?

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Yes yes, yes we have.

30
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What do you see?

31
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Damn.

32
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,500
Let's go Sam.

33
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,900
Here you go, just the way you like it....
Disgusting.

34
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Excuse me.

35
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Relax.

36
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,000
There you go.

37
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,200
No, eat your vegetables.
Don't just push 'em around, eat them.

38
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,400
I'm not playing.

39
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,200
Eat your vegetables.
Or we'll sit down here all night.

40
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,900
What are you whining about?
Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?

41
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,300
Okay, look, look.
We're gonna eat twice as many vegetables
tomorrow night.

42
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Deal?

43
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
That feels good.

44
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,700
Ah Sam.

45
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
[Singing]
[Alarm beeping]

46
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,400
Robert, what is happening? I've been trying
to reach you on the cell, I keep getting
the recording.

47
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,400
The network is down.
-- Dad, where are we going?

48
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,400
- I cannot get used to the new rags.
-- We're going to Aunt Sarah's sweetie.

49
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,000
No, why?!
- Just strap yourself in, go.

50
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,200
- We're at 30 minutes Colonel.
- Copy.

51
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,900
- 30 minutes to what?
- They're sealing off the island.

52
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,400
- Seal off the island?  This island?
- But I don't wanna go to Aunt Sarah's.

53
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,600
- Did you bring all the money?  How much?
- 600 dollars, why did you say you're going?

54
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,100
-- That is not enough.
-- Robert, you said "You're going", not "we're going".

55
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,500
- When you get across, I need you to get to the ATM.
Get as much cash as you can.

56
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,700
- It's not even summer yet.
- Take Sarah's car, go upstate.

57
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,900
I'll meet you at the farm, bring
enough food for 2 weeks.

58
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,700
Jesus, Robert. Did it jump?
Is it airborne?

59
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,400
- But we only go to Aunt Sarah's in the summer.
-- Maybe.

60
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,900
It's Christmas. What about my presents?

61
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,800
- He's announcing it.
- Make no mistake my fellow Americans.

62
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,300
- My gifts are still in the closet.
[Radio] - The mutated virus is lethal.

63
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,400
- Hush now Mar.
[Radio] - The survival of not only our nation, but
of every other nation on the planet.

64
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
- Mom, look. A butterfly.
- Marley, enough!

65
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,000
So, I announce with great sadness, but
even greater resolve.

66
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:29,600
that tonight I have signed an executive order,
initiating a military quarantine of New York City.

67
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,800
- God be with us.

68
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,800
- The window is still open, we find something
in a week..or 2 weeks,

69
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,100
...we can reverse the spread.

70
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,300
I can still fix this.

71
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,000
Please, you can do the same work
outside the city.

72
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,000
Ground zero, this is my site.
We talked about this.

73
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,000
What are you doing?

74
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,700
What am I doing?

75
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,300
- I'm not gonna let this happen.
- Let? This isn't up to you, you can't...

76
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,900
How did you sleep?

77
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,400
Now come on, you know better than that.

78
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,200
I'll be back.

79
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,500
Dr. Robert Neville, September 5, 2012.
GA series serum 391.

80
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,700
Animal trials, streaming video.

81
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,700
The results appear typical.

82
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,700
Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 ...

83
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,500
14, 16 and 18 did not kill the virus.

84
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Compounds 2, 5, 7, 12, 13, 15 and 17 ...

85
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,000
All killed the host.

86
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Hold on a second.

87
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,400
Compound 6 seems to be showing decreased
aggression response.
Partial pigmentation returned.

88
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,400
Slight pupil constriction.

89
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:19,300
GA series serum 391 compound 6
is the next candidate for human trials.

90
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Hang in there number 6.

91
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,700
Yeah, that's what you want.

92
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,500
Good morning, Marge and Fred.
What are you doing here so early?

93
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,300
Nice sweatshirt there Fred.
Don't fit it down anywhere.

94
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,200
I see you inside.

95
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,900
What's happening brother?

96
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,200
Good morning Hank.
Getting through the G's.

97
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Who's the girl ...

98
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,800
Nevermind, hey I'll see you in the morning.

99
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:07,900
- What am I supposed to say?
- Hello, wanna see some infected rats.

100
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,500
Okay, tomorrow.
I'm going to say hello tomorrow.

101
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,100
You did so good.
Yes, yes.

102
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,100
Look at that, see that?  Red salmon.
Wow, actual Spam.

103
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,100
No, you'll get some of that later.

104
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Let's go.

105
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,100
I am Robert Neville. I am a survivor
living in New York City.

106
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,600
I am broadcasting on all
AM frequencies.

107
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:26,300
I will be at the South Street seaport everyday
at midday, when the sun is at its highest
in the sky.

108
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,700
If you are out there...if anyone is out there,

109
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:42,000
I can provide food, I can provide shelter,
I can provide security.

110
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,700
If there is anybody out there, anybody...

111
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,800
Please, you are not alone.

112
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Keep your eye on this one for me.

113
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm getting good.

114
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,700
Call Sam. I gotta call him.
I gotta call him.

115
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,800
Sam, come on. We have to go.

116
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,200
What are you doing?

117
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,300
Sam, we gotta go!

118
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,100
Sam, go now, get out!

119
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,600
You need to pay attention, okay?
- Gotta pay attention.

120
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,600
Listen, I want you to stay here on
this one, okay?

121
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,300
Because you can still get infected and I can't.

122
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,500
Listen, if I am not back by dark...

123
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,600
Just go.

124
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:37,900
Okay, the subject is female.
Most likely 18-20 years of age.

125
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,500
??? Push effective 6 times the human dose.

126
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,400
Core temperature 106 Fahrenheit, pulse 200 bpm,

127
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,700
..respiration elevated, PAO2 300% of normal.

128
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,800
The pupils are fully dilated.
Now reactive to light.

129
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,000
Extreme reaction to UV exposure...

130
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:23,400
Symptoms and tissue samples confirm subject
is infected with KV.

131
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:33,500
Vaccine test series serum 391 compound six.
Commencing human trials.

132
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,500
Respiration is slowing, pulse 190,

133
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:09,500
Core temperature 105, 104 and decreasing.

134
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,600
We may have something here.

135
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,700
GA series serum 391 compound 6,
ineffective on humans.

136
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:29,100
Test results linked to this entry,
saved on 6 redundant drives.

137
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,100
Still no cure.

138
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Day 1001: We came in close contact with a Hyve today.

139
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,500
The blood tests confirm that I remain immune....

140
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,800
for both the airborne and contact strains.

141
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,300
Canines remain immune to airborne strain only.

142
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,800
You can't go running into the dark dummy.

143
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,500
Vaccine trials continue.  I am still unable
to transfer my immunity...

144
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:23,900
...to infected host.  Krippin virus is....
elegant.

145
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,400
It's like fishing in the dark, son.

146
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:44,200
A behavioral note : Um, an infected male
exposed himself to sunlight today.

147
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:52,900
Now it's possible that decreased brain function..or...
growing scarcity of food is..

148
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,500
...is causing them to ignore their basic
survival instincts.

149
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:11,100
Social de-evolution appears complete.
Typical human behavior is now entirely absent.

150
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,200
Why are we stopping?

151
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,500
?????
- You've got less than 10 minutes.

152
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,500
Baby, give me the dog.

153
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,500
-- Let's go baby, let's go.
- Daddy.

154
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,700
Stay in my neighborhood and let nobody stop you by.

155
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,000
-- Mommy, they have guns.
-- It's okay, they're in the army like daddy.

156
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,700
Then, please, back home.
-- Coming through.

157
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:41,700
If you are not covered by the checkpoint,
then, please, go home.

158
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,700
You're clear. Go ahead.
-- Clear.

159
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,900
Clear...okay, next, let's go.

160
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,500
No good.

161
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,300
Clear -- Okay, go.

162
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,400
-- We are not infected.
-- Please, please take my baby.

163
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,500
You have to move back.

164
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,500
No good.
- What, no!  Robert, Robert!

165
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,900
Whoa, whoa, get your hands off my wife.

166
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,500
I'm lieutenant Robert Neville

167
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,400
Get your hands off me.

168
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,500
-- Scan her again.
-- Stand down!

169
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,300
-- Stand down soldier! Stand down!
-- I am Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Neville.

170
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,300
I order you to scan her again.
Scan her again!

171
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,200
-- Alright, scan her again.

172
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,200
Clear, it's clear, move through.

173
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,600
Dad, why can't we go to our home too?

174
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,000
-- How long?
-- Five minutes, we'll make it.

175
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,800
With Merage, code: 621. We are on site.

176
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,800
I won't take my eyes off them Colonel.
You got my word on it.

177
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,800
Give me a kiss.

178
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,400
Be careful. -- You too.

179
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,400
-- Dear God, please watch over Robert,
keep him strong for the struggle ahead of him Lord.

180
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,100
Please, just bring him home safely, Amen.

181
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,400
Daddy's going to make the monsters go away
baby, okay?

182
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,600
-- Sam, you protect Daddy.
-- No baby, I can't take the dog!

183
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,600
Sir, we have to go.

184
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,500
Dad, look, a butterfly.

185
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,000
-- How'd you sleep?
[TV] -- Dr. Robert Neville will be taking
a closer look

186
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:35,200
...at the ongoing mutations of Dr. Alice Krippin's
once hailed miracle cure for cancer.

187
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:43,200
So far, almost 5000 patients treated with a
retrofitted virus, had begun exhibiting symptoms
resembling the early onset of rabies.

188
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,500
25 patients have already died. Dr. Neville
has ordered local hospitals to stockpile

189
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:54,200
antiviral drugs, and to begin preliminary quarantine
protocol....

190
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,500
--It's my birthday today.
[TV] - We are fully confident Dr. Neville can see us through...

191
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,800
-- Would you like to sing?

192
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,800
My name is Robert Neville, I am a survivor living
in New York City.

193
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,100
I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.

194
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:21,500
I will be at the South Street seaport everyday, midday,
when the sun is highest in the sky.

195
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:27,400
If you are out there....if anyone is out there....

196
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:34,100
I can provide food, I can provide shelter,
I can provide security.

197
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,000
If there's anybody out there, anybody...

198
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:45,200
Please, you are not alone.

199
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:52,300
Listen, if you're planning a party or something,
just tell me now.

200
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:58,700
Okay, because I don't like surprises, and I swear
I'll act surprised. Okay?

201
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,200
What are you doing out here Fred?

202
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,200
What the hell are you.....no!
-- No! No!

203
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:03,400
What the hell are you doing out here Fred!?!
How did you get out here?!?

204
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,500
Fred, if you're real, you better tell me
right now!

205
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,700
If you're real, you better tell me right now!

206
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,200
Damn, Fred.

207
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,200
I'm okay.

208
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,900
I'm okay.

209
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,400
I'm okay.

210
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Come on, Sam.
Come on.

211
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,200
Come on Sam!

212
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,100
No, no, let's go Sam, we gotta go home Sam.
Let's go.

213
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,400
Okay, you're alright.

214
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,600
It's okay. You're alright.
You're alright.

215
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,600
Samantha, Samantha.
Look at me girl. Hey, you're okay.

216
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:51,500
Samantha, just gotta get you home.
Gotta take you home, take you home.

217
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,600
Alright, come here.

218
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,500
Come here, come here, got you.

219
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,100
It's okay.

220
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:45,800
I promised my friend.... that I would say hello...
to you today.

221
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,200
Please say hello to me.

222
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,200
Please say hello to me.

223
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,200
Sterf.

224
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:06,200
Sterf.

225
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,300
Can you hear me?

226
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,100
Stick with me.

227
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,100
Where you live?

228
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,400
Where you live?

229
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,400
I love her. I love him.

230
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,800
Washington and Square.
They don't know where I live.

231
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:25,800
The night is a big trap.
You must stay in till dawn.

232
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:22,400
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered, obviously
you know that.  They're yours.

233
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:28,000
But I did find bacon.  I just found the most
fantastic thing in history.

234
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:33,100
I found some antibiotics in the bathroom, I put
by your plate because your leg is okay,

235
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:39,800
but you won't be for very long, if you don't
start a course very soon.

236
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:45,400
Who are you?
-- I am Anna and this is Ethan.

237
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,500
They're going to get cold.

238
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:11,200
It's okay.  Go on.

239
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:40,900
We come from Maryland.
We heard your message heard on the radio.

240
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,700
We were at the pier at noon, we waited all day.

241
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:50,600
We're going to Vermont.
To the survivor's colony.

242
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,700
In Bethel. It is a safe zone.

243
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:03,300
There's no survivor's colony, no safe zone.
Nothing's happening the way it was supposed to happen.

244
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:09,900
Nothing worked the way it was supposed to work.
-- In the mountains, there is a whole colony of
people there who didn't get sick.

245
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,000
The virus couldn't survive the cold, there's a whole...
-- Shut up!

246
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,700
Everybody's dead.
Everybody's dead.

247
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,800
I just need a minute, okay?

248
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,800
Just....

249
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:41,700
I just, I was saving that bacon.

250
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,800
I was saving it.

251
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:49,200
I'm gonna go upstairs, alright, just.
I'm gonna go.

252
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:11,700
Ethan, put that knife down.

253
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:21,600
[repeating the TV] - Can I say something to you?
You was really really something back there.

254
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,900
are you talking to...me?

255
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:31,700
Can I tell you that you were great? Those guards.

256
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:38,500
They thought that they were tough.
And when you came and they were nowhere.
That was fun to see.

257
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,600
That's great. Seriously. -- It is nice to be free.

258
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:46,500
Why don't you celebrate your freedom
with your own friends?  Hmm?

259
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:52,800
But I have no friends. And I am not going
out there by myself.

260
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,600
Wait, I have a great idea.
I'll stick with you.

261
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,600
I like Shrek.

262
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,900
You are not as good with people anymore
are you?

263
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,600
Thank you for my leg.

264
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:45,700
Where have you been?
- I was on a Red Cross evacuation ship
out of Saint Paolo.

265
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:50,900
- Those boats weren't meant to be permanent.
--No they weren't.

266
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:54,000
When the Navy fell apart, we set on dock
to get supplies.

267
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:58,000
Someone picked it up on shore.
5 of us were immune.

268
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:02,100
You said five. -- The dark seekers got them.

269
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,300
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?

270
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:21,200
It's too late today. If we leave tomorrow at dawn,
we can make it to Vermont in a straight shot.

271
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,300
so if we ...
-- I'm not leaving.

272
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:30,200
This is ground zero. This is my site.

273
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:35,200
I'm not gonna let this happen.

274
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:40,200
I can still fix this.

275
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:56,800
Oh, you scared me.
-- Sorry.

276
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:00,000
I called down twice.
-- Oh thank you.

277
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:09,400
That's heavily sedated, don't worry it's safe.

278
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:14,700
I've never seen one so still.
They're always biting.

279
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:22,700
Do you think that can cure her?

280
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:27,700
No, this will almost certainly kill it, but it's
possible by drastically reducing

281
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:34,100
her body temperature, I can increase the compound's
effectiveness.

282
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:46,800
Did all of them die?
-- Yes.

283
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:54,300
My God.
-- God didn't do this Anna.

284
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,900
We did.

285
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:05,300
Where can Ethan sleep?

286
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,900
He is heavy.

287
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,300
Can you ...

288
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,500
She is beautiful. What's her name?

289
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:18,200
Her name is Marley
-- It's a beautiful name.

290
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,400
Yeah, we named her after Bob Marley.

291
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,200
Who?
-- The singer.

292
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:33,300
Damian?
-- His father.

293
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,900
His father.

294
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:01,400
That is unacceptable.
-- What?

295
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,800
Best album ever made.

296
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
You recognize that?

297
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,500
He had this idea, it was kind of a
virologist idea.

298
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:37,100
He believed that you could cure racism
and hate, literally cure it, by

299
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:42,100
injecting music and love into
people's lives.

300
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:48,100
One day, he was scheduled to perform at
a peace rally,

301
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,700
a gunman came to his house and shot him down.

302
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:59,400
Two days later he walked out on that stage and sang.

303
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:05,300
Somebody asked him, why.

304
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:10,900
He said: "The people who are trying to make
this world worse....

305
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:15,600
...are not taking a day off. How can I?"

306
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,500
Light up the darkness.

307
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,300
Come with us, Neville.
To the colony.

308
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,400
There is not a colony, Anna.

309
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:09,400
Everything just fell apart, there was no evacuation.
-- Wrong, there is a colony.

310
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:14,200
I know okay?
-- How do you know, Anna?

311
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:25,000
I just know.

312
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:29,200
How, I said how do you know?
-- How could you know?

313
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:33,800
God told me, he has a plan.

314
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:39,100
God told you? The God?
-- Yes.

315
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,900
I know how this sounds.
-- It sounds crazy.

316
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
But something told me to turn
on the radio.

317
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:53,700
Something told me to come here.
-- My voice on the radio told you to come here Anna.

318
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:57,100
You were trying to kill yourself last night, right?
-- Anna.

319
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,700
And I got here just in time to save your life.
-- Do you think it is a coincidence?

320
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:05,300
Just stop it.
-- He must have sent me here for a reason.

321
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:10,800
Neville, the world is quieter now.
You just have to listen.

322
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,400
If we listen, we can hear God's plan.

323
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:20,100
God's plan? Alright, let me tell you
about your God's plan.

324
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,900
We were 6 billion people on earth when the infection hit.

325
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,100
KV had a 90% kill rate, that is 5.4 billion people.

326
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,600
Dead.  Crashed and bled out...dead.

327
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:40,000
Less than 1% immunity.  That is 12 million healthy people
like you, me, and Ethan.

328
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:46,800
The other 588 million turned into your dark seekers.

329
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:53,400
And then they got hungry, and
they killed, and fed on everybody.

330
01:19:54,400 --> 01:20:03,000
Everybody. Every single person that you or I
has ever known...is DEAD!!

331
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,400
Dead!

332
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:13,400
There is no God.
There is no God.

333
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,600
What is that?

334
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,200
Was it still dark when you brought
us home last night?

335
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:30,000
You were bleeding, there was light
on the horizon.

336
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:34,300
Turn the light off.
Turn it off.

337
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,900
They followed us home.

338
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,400
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

339
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,900
Are you okay?
-- Yes.

340
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:34,100
Go to the lab. Downstairs.
Go! To the lab. To the lab.

341
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:48,300
Get behind them plates.
-- Come on.

342
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,800
Come on. It is okay.

343
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,500
It's working.

344
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:30,700
It's working.

345
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,400
Stop.

346
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:45,500
I can save you. I can help you.
You are sick and I can help you.

347
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:50,500
I can fix this!
I can save everybody!

348
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,500
I can fix this.
It's working.

349
01:26:57,300 --> 01:27:00,400
Stop.

350
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:08,500
I can save you. Let me save you.

351
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:41,500
Dad, look, a butterfly.

352
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:13,000
What are you doing?
-- The cure is in my blood.

353
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,000
Go, you're going to be safe.
Ethan get in.

354
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,100
Go inside.

355
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,700
Anna, I think this is why you're here.

356
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,800
What are you doing?
-- I'm listening.

357
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:41,600
Neville, there is room in here, come on.
-- They're not gonna stop.

358
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,800
Stay until dawn.

359
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:08,400
In 2009, a deadly virus burned through our
civilization.

360
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,900
Pushing humankind to the edge
of extinction.

361
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:17,400
Dr. Robert Neville dedicated his life
to the discovery of a cure.

362
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:23,100
And the restoration of humanity.
On September 9, 2012 ...

363
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:28,700
At approximately 8:49 P.M.,
he discovered that cure.

364
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:35,000
And at 8:52, he gave his life to defend it.

365
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:41,300
We are his legacy.
-- This is his legend.

366
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Light up the darkness.
