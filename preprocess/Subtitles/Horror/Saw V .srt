1
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:14,150
Fuck! Fuck!

2
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:18,204
What the f...!

3
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:19,724
Fuck!

4
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:27,194
What the fuck!

5
00:01:27,743 --> 00:01:28,973
Fuck!

6
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:30,891
God!

7
00:01:31,336 --> 00:01:32,537
Help!

8
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:35,019
Fuck!

9
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:44,140
Hello Seth.

10
00:01:45,097 --> 00:01:46,595
I want to play a game.

11
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,870
Right now you´re feeling helpless.

12
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,831
This is the same helplesness
you bestowed onto others.

13
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:57,116
But now, it's onto you.
Some would call this karma,

14
00:01:57,236 --> 00:01:59,329
I call it justice.

15
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:01,574
Now you served five years 

16
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,867
of what should have been
a life sentence, for murder.

17
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,121
A technicality gave you freedom,

18
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:12,489
but it inhibited you from understanding
the impact of taking a life.

19
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:15,275
Today, I offer you true freedom.

20
00:02:15,283 --> 00:02:18,432
In thirty seconds,
the pendulum will drop far enough

21
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:20,080
to touch your body.

22
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:23,875
Within sixty seconds, it will cut you in half.

23
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:29,639
To avoid the pendulum, all you have to do
is destroy the things that have killed...

24
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:31,197
...your hands.

25
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:33,068
You must insert your hands

26
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:36,661
and push the buttons
to start the devices before you.

27
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:39,393
Your bones will be crushed to dust.

28
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:43,461
Will you destroy the things that have
taken life in order to save one, Seth?

29
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:45,453
Make your choice.

30
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,459
No!

31
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:15,409
It was an accident!

32
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,479
God!

33
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:22,752
Please!

34
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,012
Wait!

35
00:03:29,472 --> 00:03:31,109
Ok, fuck you!

36
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,100
God!

37
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,268
Ok, ok, ok.

38
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,431
Come on, come on...

39
00:03:58,016 --> 00:03:59,246
Fuck!

40
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:32,567
I did it! I did it!

41
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:15,909
<b>SAW  V</b>

42
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:26,179
Let me see your hands.

43
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:27,435
Let me see your hands!

44
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:29,338
Where is my daughter?
You...

45
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:40,871
Jesus.

46
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:26,018
<i>NO SIGNAL</i>

47
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:18,554
Hello, Agent Strahm.

48
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:22,839
If you're hearing this, then you've finally found
what you've been looking for.

49
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:26,223
But is the discovery of my body enough?

50
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:30,277
Or will your insatiable hunger to uncover the truth

51
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:32,802
push you deeper into the abyss?

52
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:36,105
Heed my warning: do not proceed.

53
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:42,051
For this room can either be you sanctuary,
or it can be your grave.

54
00:07:42,685 --> 00:07:44,903
The choice is yours.

55
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:49,193
Fuck you.

56
00:08:54,891 --> 00:08:56,324
Hey!

57
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:58,891
Help!

58
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:01,855
Help!

59
00:09:03,337 --> 00:09:05,119
Help!

60
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:50,793
Go, go!

61
00:10:53,582 --> 00:10:54,967
It´s ok.

62
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,226
Lets go.

63
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,035
Move it, move, move!
Stay focused!

64
00:11:00,822 --> 00:11:02,875
- Wheres my dad?
- Its gonna be ok.

65
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:04,987
Wheres my mum?
Wheres my mum?

66
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:08,262
- Hoffman.
- I got him.

67
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,829
Did you get them all?

68
00:11:12,097 --> 00:11:14,108
What the hell happened?
Where is Rigg?

69
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,457
I tried to help.

70
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,398
He didnt make it.

71
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:21,718
Nobody made it.

72
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:24,437
We got a live one!

73
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:06,467
Hello?

74
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:07,997
Right away.

75
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:09,990
Miss Tuck.

76
00:12:10,835 --> 00:12:12,053
Have a seat.

77
00:12:16,228 --> 00:12:18,488
Its nice to meet you Mr. Feldman.

78
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,077
Why am I here?

79
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,621
I represent your ex-husband John.

80
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:27,943
In the event of his death,
I was instructed to contact you.

81
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:33,058
You can understand my surprise, when I found out,
who he really was.

82
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:35,260
John left something for you.

83
00:12:57,997 --> 00:12:59,987
If youre watching this Jill,

84
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:02,176
Im long gone from this world.

85
00:13:03,353 --> 00:13:05,758
You are my heart, you always have been,

86
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:08,536
you always will be.

87
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:13,089
Im not going to try to explain the...

88
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,490
...my actions of leave. 

89
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,067
Suffice it to say that I find it difficult
to forgive myself

90
00:13:20,187 --> 00:13:22,179
for what happened at the clinic.

91
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:26,109
I permited, indeed encouraged 

92
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:28,686
your decisions
regarding the people there.

93
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:33,324
I saw a danger and I should have acted sooner.

94
00:13:33,575 --> 00:13:39,542
Im leaving you a box today
and its contents are of grave importance.

95
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:43,921
Even though you and I dont always see
eye on eye on everything

96
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,117
I deeply believe in you 

97
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:49,855
and I believe, that you will know 
what to do with these materials.

98
00:14:52,907 --> 00:14:57,423
Miss Tuck, if you dont mind,
whats in the box?

99
00:14:57,543 --> 00:14:59,912
Thank you for your time Mr. Feldman.

100
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:05,515
I want to thank you all
for coming here today

101
00:15:05,844 --> 00:15:08,052
and Id like to be the first to say

102
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:11,031
that the Jigsaw murders are over.

103
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:17,390
Why isnt this a joint press conference with the FBI?

104
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,570
Please not today miss Jenkins.

105
00:15:20,238 --> 00:15:24,742
The officers who gave their lives
are being honored here today.

106
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:27,198
But today Id like to offer special honor

107
00:15:27,318 --> 00:15:31,141
to the detective, who has been on this case
right from the beginning.

108
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:35,159
Who proved through hard work and dedication

109
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,733
that the people who died
did not die in vain.

110
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:44,647
Today we honor the newly promoted
detective lieutenant Mark Hoffman.

111
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,796
?Hes all right. God bless him.?

112
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:59,650
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

113
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:06,511
Throughout this ordeal, if we´ve learnt anything,
its that...

114
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:09,315
...human life is sacred.

115
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,192
And we´ve learnt that every day.

116
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,572
Life should be cherished.

117
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:22,122
Justice is the backbone to every peacefull society.

118
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:26,798
And I believe that true justice has been served.

119
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:31,837
Doctor Rayburn, 53.

120
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:34,055
Doctor Rayburn...

121
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,431
Sorry about agent Perez.

122
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:45,107
Shouldnt you be resting?

123
00:16:46,492 --> 00:16:48,205
Im fine Erickson.

124
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:52,353
?Knock it out Peter.?
Thats why I put you on medical leave.

125
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,684
I was supposed to die in that trap.

126
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,450
You never should have been there without back-up.

127
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:04,126
I want to talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

128
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:07,002
Youre not longer handling the case, Peter.

129
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:09,200
What?

130
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:10,850
Read it.

131
00:17:14,183 --> 00:17:16,827
Over a dozen dead bodies
were recovered at the scene.

132
00:17:16,837 --> 00:17:18,200
Two of which were cops.

133
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,839
Jigsaw is dead.
How many lives did I inevitably save?

134
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:24,313
By endangering yourself and others

135
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:27,005
- ...you are off the case.
- On whose orders?

136
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,453
Mine.

137
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,301
Im sorry Peter, its over.

138
00:18:25,907 --> 00:18:32,101
Hello agent Perez and welcome to the world,
that you have long studied.

139
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:37,638
Heed my warning agent Perez.
Your next move is critical.

140
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:40,059
- Open the door.
- What is that?

141
00:19:08,643 --> 00:19:11,142
I am truly sorry about agent Perez.

142
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:15,515
She said your name you know...

143
00:19:16,837 --> 00:19:19,510
Last thing she said wais "detective Hoffman".

144
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:22,280
Why did she said that?
Why did she say your name?

145
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:24,820
- I dont know.
- No?

146
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:28,270
How did you walk out of that building?

147
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,197
How did you?

148
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,500
On a gurney, with a fucking hole in my throat!

149
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:36,715
And you...

150
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:42,056
couple of scratches, and a story about
how your arm straps broke. Jigsaw doesn't make mistakes.

151
00:19:42,062 --> 00:19:45,113
Is this you theorising again?
Cause Jigsaw is dead.

152
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:48,780
Im not talking about him.
Im talking about you and your whole crooked department.

153
00:19:48,793 --> 00:19:50,800
My department is gone.
They are all dead.

154
00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:52,086
Theres no one left

155
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:53,882
Besides you.

156
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,953
Ive been chasing Jigsaw from the beginning.

157
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,054
And I got him.

158
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:02,279
So unless youve got something else to say...

159
00:20:02,677 --> 00:20:04,679
...back the fuck off.

160
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,428
And read the papers.
I saved that little girl.

161
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:46,032
Oh my god.

162
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:52,846
What is this?

163
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:54,930
Hey, dont move.

164
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,265
What did you do to me?

165
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,115
I didnt do anything.

166
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,605
Its Jigsaw.

167
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:02,147
- What is it?
- I knew this was going to happen to me.

168
00:22:02,157 --> 00:22:03,609
This is what he does.

169
00:22:04,752 --> 00:22:06,981
No it is not Jigsaw.

170
00:22:08,124 --> 00:22:09,547
He is dead.

171
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:12,095
Havent you watched TV lately?

172
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:14,689
Yeah, well whoever it is.

173
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,758
Theyre watching us.

174
00:22:20,852 --> 00:22:22,652
Make sure, we follow the rules.

175
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,932
Which are what?

176
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:25,580
I wouldnt do that if I were you.

177
00:22:25,588 --> 00:22:27,988
Unless you want your head to pop off
like a dendelion.

178
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:29,069
How do you know that?

179
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:30,570
Because I have eyes.

180
00:22:31,422 --> 00:22:34,489
One pulled pin starts the timer for all of us.

181
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:39,235
You dont want to do that,
unless you know how it works now, would you?

182
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:42,518
This shit is freakin' me out, dude.

183
00:22:46,941 --> 00:22:48,700
Hello and welcome.

184
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,466
From birth, you've all given
the advantages of few others.

185
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:56,140
Yet, through poor moral decisions,

186
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:02,755
you've used these advantages to selfishly
futher only yourselves at the expense of others.

187
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:07,460
Well today, this singular way of thinking
will be put to the test.

188
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,302
Today, five will become one
with the common goal of survival.

189
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,469
You are all connected.
A cable runs through your collar devices.

190
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:21,889
It can be pulled so tight that you
will be decapitated on the mounted razors.

191
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:28,600
The only way to remove the collar is with the keys
from the glass boxes on the pedastals before you.

192
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:35,730
However, if one of you moves to retrieve a key,
the 60-second timer will begin for you all.

193
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,163
In choosing how to react to the situation,

194
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:41,480
your life-long instincts will tell you to do one thing,

195
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:45,130
but I implore you to do the opposite.

196
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,787
Let the games begin.

197
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,910
Somebody has to die.

198
00:23:53,385 --> 00:23:56,290
No, no, it says don't listen to your instincts.

199
00:23:57,262 --> 00:23:59,443
- That means don't go for the keys.
- Are you fucking nuts?

200
00:23:59,461 --> 00:24:01,603
How are we supposed to live
if we don't go for the keys?

201
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,885
Maybe it's testing our endurance.

202
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:06,223
We've got to move back.
That timer is connected to those jars.

203
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,391
No, it didn't say anything about those jars.
It could be nothing

204
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,878
They're a nail-bomb.
Home-made. Probably C4.

205
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,333
How the fuck do you know that?

206
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,256
She's a fire inspector.
She's seen all kinds of demented shit.

207
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,944
How do you know me?

208
00:24:22,414 --> 00:24:25,271
Hey, man, she's asking you a question.
How do you know her?

209
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:30,030
How do you know her?!

210
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,751
- Answer me!
- Look, let's just keep our cool.

211
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:37,509
- Maybe we can figure this out.
- We're all here for a reason.

212
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:41,133
We're all connected.
That's what the message said.

213
00:24:45,392 --> 00:24:48,155
- What did you do?
- You go first.

214
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,810
It, it, it said we were all born with advantages, right?

215
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,554
Me was born for money.

216
00:24:59,742 --> 00:25:01,500
- I'm not.
- And neither have I.

217
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,771
Nice fucking try, Nancy Drew.

218
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,050
Well, then what does it mean?

219
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,225
We all did something wrong
with the advantage we were given from birth.

220
00:25:09,235 --> 00:25:10,601
That doesnt have to mean money.

221
00:25:10,721 --> 00:25:12,135
What are you not telling us?

222
00:25:12,255 --> 00:25:14,478
Huh? You know about her.

223
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,561
What do you know about the rest of us?

224
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:20,422
- Would you fucking talk to me?!
- Relax.

225
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:26,050
- I am fucking relaxed!
- It's a game, tweeker! Get it?

226
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,140
The less you know about me, the better.

227
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,687
The reason why you fucked up your charm existences
is pretty obvious to everyone, isn't it?

228
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:37,686
Fuck you.

229
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,912
Fuck you!

230
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,051
Been play with matches again, have we?

231
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,366
Fuck all of you!
?You fucking queer!?

232
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:44,576
Not yet!

233
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,923
Unless you wanna be shredded when
those nail-bombs go off, I suggest we move on.

234
00:27:55,791 --> 00:27:57,089
What are you doing?

235
00:27:57,612 --> 00:27:58,774
Being smart.

236
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,650
Special agent Strahms office.

237
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,483
This is detective Hoffman.
Is agent Strahm available?

238
00:28:14,603 --> 00:28:17,460
He is not, but i can connect you
to special agent Erickson.

239
00:28:17,475 --> 00:28:20,443
- Hes handling all enquiries.
- Please.

240
00:28:22,706 --> 00:28:27,113
You have reached the voicemail box of
special agent Erickson. Please leave a message.

241
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:29,850
Yeah, this is detective Hoffman.

242
00:28:30,154 --> 00:28:34,530
I needed to discuss something with agent Strahm,
but I cant seem to track him down.

243
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:37,835
Could you give me a call?
It would be greatly appreciated.

244
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:40,688
There you are.

245
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:03,014
....

246
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:31,387
...

247
00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:41,286
...

248
00:30:45,484 --> 00:30:49,961
...

249
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:02,360
Peter.

250
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:08,430
- Cowan, take it to Alistair.
- Right away sir.

251
00:31:10,657 --> 00:31:11,810
What do you do here?

252
00:31:12,108 --> 00:31:16,640
Just grabbing some stuff from the office.
Im taking your advice.

253
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:18,703
Taking some time-off, huh?

254
00:31:18,719 --> 00:31:21,151
Yeah, well I have to heal up, you know?

255
00:31:22,302 --> 00:31:24,974
You know? Ill keep in touch.
Ill see you around.

256
00:32:56,282 --> 00:32:58,864
Hoffman weve got another body.

257
00:32:58,984 --> 00:33:00,650
Looks like another Jigsaw victim.

258
00:33:01,386 --> 00:33:04,427
Youre after this?
Yeah.

259
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:10,393
Typical ??? murder convict. Served five years,
just released last month.

260
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:17,498
I know him.
His name is Seth Baxter.

261
00:33:18,486 --> 00:33:20,152
My sisters ex-boyfriend.

262
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:24,370
This is the guy that murdered your sister?

263
00:33:24,825 --> 00:33:29,488
He was sentenced to 25 years.
They reduced it to 5 on a technicality.

264
00:33:31,445 --> 00:33:33,425
Well Id say justice was served.

265
00:33:43,906 --> 00:33:45,058
You killed him.

266
00:33:45,086 --> 00:33:47,075
Made it look like Jigsaw trap.

267
00:33:50,415 --> 00:33:51,900
I got you.

268
00:33:57,215 --> 00:33:58,532
Not yet!

269
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:00,790
Dont close the door.
It will set off the timer.

270
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:03,585
- Do you know that for sure?
- Educated guess.

271
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,980
What we need to do is figure out
who everyone is.

272
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:10,337
- Well, we know the dead woman worked for the fire department.
- Not anymore.

273
00:34:10,457 --> 00:34:14,826
- She got canned a month ago.
- How the fuck do you...how the fuck do you know that?

274
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:17,978
You're responsible for this sh...!
You had her fucking head cut off!

275
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:21,591
- I'm closing the door! I'm gonna close the fucking door!
- Be quiet!

276
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,523
Please.

277
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:30,415
What's your story?

278
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,603
I work for the Department of City Planning.

279
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:35,359
- Married? Kids?
- No. And no.

280
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:37,221
Your turn.

281
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,903
Youre not gonna tell them about daddy?

282
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:46,044
My dad is... Richard Gibbs.

283
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:47,300
You remember the Cougars?

284
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:50,835
He's been trying to build a new stadium for years.

285
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:56,525
Little did he know all he had to do was
to wait for his daughter to get a job in city planning.

286
00:34:58,614 --> 00:35:00,790
And you? What about you?

287
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:03,260
What sort of shady shit have you been up to?

288
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,503
I'm a senior VP for a real estate development company.

289
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:08,329
So you're boring, too.

290
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,429
The Marshford group.

291
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:17,522
You know you can't get permit in this town
without going to city planning. Right?

292
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:20,204
- Right?
- No, you cant.

293
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:21,950
What about you?

294
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:29,900
No wife, no kids that I know of, no job.

295
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:32,245
Trust him, baby. Anyone surprised.

296
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,756
I'm so fucking sick of your
self-righteousness, man!

297
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:36,342
Its your turn.

298
00:35:36,462 --> 00:35:40,820
I'm an investigative journalist for The Herald.

299
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:41,940
The Harold?

300
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:44,720
xxx you work for a gossip rag?

301
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,800
Bite your fucking tongue.

302
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,583
What the hell are in those jars?

303
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:53,768
Let's do this fucking thing before the bombs go off.

304
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:01,700
Fuck!

305
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:05,550
Hello and welcome to the next lesson.

306
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:08,908
These walls hold four chambers.

307
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,680
These chambers offer safety.

308
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,870
However, to access them, a key is needed.

309
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,400
but only three of the keys will fit the locks.

310
00:36:19,415 --> 00:36:23,390
These keys are in the glass jars
hanging from the ceiling.

311
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,600
Move quickly, though.

312
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,900
Because when the clock ticks down,

313
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:31,680
the explosives in the corners of the room will detonate.

314
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,672
With only three points of safety,

315
00:36:33,685 --> 00:36:36,370
which of you will be the odd man out?

316
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:38,520
Make your choice.

317
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,200
Fuck!

318
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,971
Fuck its blank.
I need a shape.

319
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:57,832
Mr.xxx is not going anywhere!

320
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:04,715
- Stop it!
- Get a clue you fucking bitches! Survival of the fittest!

321
00:37:20,658 --> 00:37:21,888
Blank.

322
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:24,578
Blank.

323
00:37:27,868 --> 00:37:28,972
Shit.

324
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,632
I got it.

325
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:45,533
Yes!

326
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:55,094
Better luck next time you rich boy.

327
00:37:57,951 --> 00:38:00,140
Survival of the fittest my ass.

328
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:14,887
Wait!

329
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:44,323
After Seth you were involved in every investigation.

330
00:38:46,444 --> 00:38:48,623
When did you first meet Jigsaw?

331
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:22,500
OUT OF ORDER

332
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:09,743
Do you mind ?!

333
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:18,843
- Going up?
- Yes, thank you.

334
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,567
What story are you going to?

335
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:54,831
I think were both going to the same place.

336
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:29,180
You know, why youre here, dont you?

337
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:35,857
They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

338
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:41,309
But I find it somewhat... distasteful.

339
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:44,928
To be given credit for work that's not mine. 

340
00:41:45,648 --> 00:41:48,800
...

341
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:52,900
Especially inferior work.

342
00:41:57,601 --> 00:42:00,522
Like you, I know what it's like to lose family.

343
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:05,734
I know what it's like not to be able 
to protect loved ones.

344
00:42:06,993 --> 00:42:08,814
It's a powerless feeling.

345
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,250
I wouldn't do that.

346
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:23,465
Hair-trigger.

347
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:27,652
What do you see?

348
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:34,101
Vengeance can change a person.

349
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:37,627
Make you into something you never thought 
you were capable of being.

350
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:42,811
But, unlike you, I've never killed anyone. 

351
00:42:43,305 --> 00:42:44,961
I give people a chance.

352
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:48,172
- You call this a chance?
- We will see.

353
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,600
Our game's just begun.

354
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:55,120
Our game? You dont even know me.

355
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,603
No.

356
00:42:57,126 --> 00:43:01,623
I know you. 
I followed you as you pursued me.

357
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:04,940
I know you. I know about your sister.

358
00:43:05,303 --> 00:43:07,421
I know how you cared for her.

359
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,180
I know she was your only family.

360
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:17,644
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

361
00:43:21,644 --> 00:43:22,903
No!

362
00:43:30,784 --> 00:43:33,203
You sit in bars until closing.

363
00:43:33,231 --> 00:43:34,990
You drink so you can sleep.

364
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:40,215
You stagger to your car and then you 
start it all over again the next day.

365
00:43:44,263 --> 00:43:47,091
And I discovered what you do for recreation.

366
00:43:54,095 --> 00:43:56,052
You can dispense justice.

367
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:59,732
You can give people a chance 
to value their lives in the same moment.

368
00:44:01,853 --> 00:44:03,462
And by the way:

369
00:44:04,363 --> 00:44:07,646
the blade on your pendulum was inferior.

370
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,987
If you want a true edge,

371
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,479
you have to use tempered steel.

372
00:44:16,698 --> 00:44:19,150
Tempering's better for the long haul.

373
00:44:19,879 --> 00:44:22,400
You in this for the long haul, detective?

374
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:26,636
I've been a cop for 20 years. 
Is that long enough for you?

375
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:30,622
Then you and I both know the statistics 
for repeat offenders in this city.

376
00:44:30,951 --> 00:44:36,059
67.5% of criminals are back in prison 
within three years.

377
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:37,946
What do you want from me?!

378
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:41,595
So you might look at what you did to Seth 
as a kind of public service.

379
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,120
She was my only family.

380
00:44:45,757 --> 00:44:47,637
He didn't deserve a chance! 
He was an animal!

381
00:44:47,647 --> 00:44:49,500
Everybody deserves a chance!

382
00:44:49,506 --> 00:44:51,153
You didn't see the blood! 

383
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:54,005
You didn't see what he fucking did to her!

384
00:44:54,034 --> 00:44:56,625
Killing is distasteful...!

385
00:44:59,024 --> 00:45:00,109
To me.

386
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:07,935
There is a better, more efficient, way.

387
00:45:15,696 --> 00:45:18,252
What do you see? Look!

388
00:45:18,795 --> 00:45:21,371
- What do you see?
- Tell me what you want!

389
00:45:23,964 --> 00:45:27,751
I want to know if you have what it takes to survive.

390
00:45:48,157 --> 00:45:49,237
Fuck you.

391
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:51,484
Fuck you.

392
00:45:53,632 --> 00:45:56,431
You see, it's a different method that I'm talking about.

393
00:45:56,644 --> 00:45:59,104
If the subject survives my method,

394
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:01,749
he or she is instantly rehabilitated.

395
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:05,200
Now, you want a chance?

396
00:46:07,273 --> 00:46:08,638
You want a chance? 

397
00:46:09,171 --> 00:46:10,682
I'll give you a chance.

398
00:46:18,634 --> 00:46:21,114
I am the man you call "Jigsaw".

399
00:46:23,477 --> 00:46:25,731
It's your duty to bring me in.

400
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:28,500
But I know who you are

401
00:46:28,743 --> 00:46:30,718
and I know what youve done.

402
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:36,760
So this is blackmail?

403
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,200
No, no, no...

404
00:46:39,156 --> 00:46:41,064
This is redemption.

405
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,523
Just giving you an option. That's all.

406
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,361
Now, you can arrest me,

407
00:46:52,048 --> 00:46:54,867
but in doing so, your life ends as you know it.

408
00:46:56,203 --> 00:46:57,200
Or...

409
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,250
you could explore

410
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:05,150
a method of rehabilitation 
that'll permit you to sleep at night.

411
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:28,822
Or I can kill you right now.

412
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:30,881
But you're not a true killer.

413
00:47:32,127 --> 00:47:33,647
That's your dilemma.

414
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:37,085
And the information I have on you 
is exactly where I needs to be.

415
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,723
And it will be released in the event of my disappearance.

416
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:44,361
They'll never believe your word over mine.

417
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:49,146
You're willing to take that risk?

418
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:51,800
The risk of ruining your own life

419
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:57,300
in order to protect a corrupt legal system 
that puts murderers back on the streets?

420
00:48:03,759 --> 00:48:05,594
How would your sister feel?

421
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:08,222
We're at a crossroads, detective.

422
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:10,444
Make your choice.

423
00:48:33,205 --> 00:48:35,540
Did you help Jigsaw get hold of them?

424
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:25,260
Detective Hoffman,
this is special agent Erickson.

425
00:49:25,938 --> 00:49:29,900
You had something you needed to discuss
about the Jigsaw case?

426
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:34,229
Yes, I stopped by agent Strahms room tonight
at the hospital, but he wasnt there.

427
00:49:34,243 --> 00:49:36,815
- I hope hes all right.
- Oh yeah, he is fine..

428
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:41,528
Agent Strahm was theorizing
about the possibility of an additional accomplice to Jigsaw...

429
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:43,180
...other than Amanda Young.

430
00:49:43,484 --> 00:49:45,652
Someone who might be currently unknown.

431
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,780
Did he ever metioned anything like that to you?

432
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:51,796
No. But then again, I knew the case.

433
00:49:51,816 --> 00:49:55,600
Yeah, well, maybe you can get him 
to contact me at his earliest convience.

434
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,915
Will do. And

435
00:49:58,081 --> 00:49:59,875
in his theorizing,

436
00:50:00,552 --> 00:50:03,506
who exactly did you suspect to be an accomplice?

437
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:07,221
Well, he suspected someone on the inside.

438
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:08,750
Someone with access.

439
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:10,450
That's an interesting theory.

440
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,413
Detective...

441
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:14,765
what do you say we reconnect in the morning?

442
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:16,391
You got it.

443
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:03,946
God. The guy was an asshole but he was smart.

444
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:05,988
We could have used him.

445
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:08,052
Well, someone had to die.

446
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:12,255
Would you rather it have been you?

447
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:13,320
How did they get you?

448
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:29,130
I will kill you! I will kill you!

449
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,462
?all right, kill me?

450
00:54:20,467 --> 00:54:22,046
Hello Paul.

451
00:54:22,811 --> 00:54:26,688
Did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die

452
00:54:26,808 --> 00:54:29,050
or did you just want some attention?

453
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,675
Tonight, you'll show me.

454
00:54:31,795 --> 00:54:35,171
If you want to live, you'll have to cut yourself again.

455
00:54:37,326 --> 00:54:40,464
How much blood will you shed to stay alive, Paul?

456
00:55:31,823 --> 00:55:34,070
I didn't expect to feel any remorse.

457
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:37,337
The heart cannot be involved.

458
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:39,840
Emotionally, there can be nothing there.

459
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:42,718
It can never be personal.

460
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:45,380
- Lets go.
- No.

461
00:55:46,388 --> 00:55:47,993
Youre not done yet.

462
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:53,045
Tonight, you will see the difference 
between killing and rehabilitation.

463
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:09,674
There's another detective 
that you should be aware of.

464
00:56:10,078 --> 00:56:11,367
His name's Tapp

465
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:13,582
He's smart. He's getting closer.

466
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:15,923
I know who he is.

467
00:56:20,422 --> 00:56:23,133
I need you to lead him to somewhere for me.

468
00:56:26,034 --> 00:56:27,344
A doctor. 

469
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,725
A healer who needs some healing.

470
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:37,898
Is this yours, doctor? 

471
00:56:45,983 --> 00:56:49,160
You supplied these police files, didnt you?

472
00:57:21,168 --> 00:57:23,610
Youre assuming this is gonna play out 
the way you want it?

473
00:57:24,422 --> 00:57:26,020
I assume nothing.

474
00:57:31,404 --> 00:57:36,456
I anticipate the possibilities 
and I let the game play out.

475
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,015
Then why do you need Amanda in the game?

476
00:57:43,329 --> 00:57:45,714
To ensure that the rules are followed.

477
00:57:47,676 --> 00:57:50,765
- She won't make decisions for anyone. 
- She will just...

478
00:57:52,898 --> 00:57:54,418
...offer choices.

479
00:57:56,928 --> 00:57:58,400
A little to your left.

480
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:08,842
That leaves it up to chance.

481
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:27,272
If you're good at anticipating the human mind,

482
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:35,907
it leaves nothing to chance.

483
00:58:49,696 --> 00:58:50,781
Its time.

484
00:59:08,747 --> 00:59:10,325
Jesus Christ!

485
00:59:15,716 --> 00:59:17,850
Great. More bombs.

486
00:59:22,104 --> 00:59:23,919
All right, what did you do to get here?

487
00:59:24,972 --> 00:59:27,151
I... I did something

488
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:29,361
...and a bunch of people were killed.

489
00:59:29,862 --> 00:59:31,179
I didnt mean to.

490
00:59:32,467 --> 00:59:34,413
There're still deads. 

491
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:36,711
- And that's why you're here?
- Yeah.

492
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,600
Shouldn't you have gone to jail
for something like that?

493
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:41,540
Nobody else knows.

494
00:59:46,879 --> 00:59:48,755
Somebody does.

495
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,598
I didn't kill anybody 
if that's what you're asking.

496
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:02,293
I wasnt.

497
01:00:03,729 --> 01:00:05,733
I grant building permits.

498
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:14,004
And yes, some people might have been more deserving than others. 
But you know what? That's the business.

499
01:00:14,124 --> 01:00:16,742
So if someone tells you different, 
well then they're just stupid.

500
01:00:16,867 --> 01:00:17,951
Or naive. 

501
01:00:18,811 --> 01:00:19,896
Or both.

502
01:00:20,162 --> 01:00:21,246
Bullshit.

503
01:00:21,504 --> 01:00:24,833
You take bribes, you're a fucking liar, 
you cheat people. That's not nice.

504
01:00:25,397 --> 01:00:26,460
Yeah...

505
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:30,130
But I'm sure she's not exactly 
Mother Teresa either.

506
01:00:30,515 --> 01:00:31,522
No, Im not.

507
01:00:31,532 --> 01:00:35,046
I don't give a shit. Close the fucking door, 
we have to hear the rules.

508
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:48,100
Hello and welcome.

509
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:53,330
You must all be eager to learn 
the next important lesson in your transformation.

510
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:54,698
The game before you

511
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:58,247
is designed to bridge the gap between you all. 

512
01:00:58,367 --> 01:01:02,265
In order to open the five locks on the door 
out of this room,

513
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:06,400
the five electrical circuits 
powering them must be closed.

514
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:13,034
The only way to do this is to find a way 
to connect all five cords to the bath water.

515
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:16,635
Close the circuits, and the door will open.

516
01:01:16,755 --> 01:01:18,267
But you must work quickly

517
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:24,704
for in three minutes, an electrical current will surge 
through this room locking the doors forever.

518
01:01:24,742 --> 01:01:26,650
Who will bridge the gap?

519
01:01:26,715 --> 01:01:28,188
The choice is yours.

520
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:34,111
Jesus Christ!

521
01:01:38,568 --> 01:01:40,622
Its not gonna reach.
How the fuck are we gonna do this?

522
01:01:40,664 --> 01:01:42,026
Come on!

523
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:48,521
No, don't do it! Please, no.

524
01:01:59,941 --> 01:02:03,340
You killed her. 
You fucking killed her.

525
01:02:03,369 --> 01:02:04,744
I didnt trust her.

526
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,728
Jesus Christ what is it with you too?

527
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:10,251
Just shut up and help me with the body.

528
01:02:27,738 --> 01:02:30,624
Wait, wait. No.
Dont let your body touch hers.

529
01:02:59,295 --> 01:03:01,028
Oh my god, its a hook.

530
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:07,427
Stick it in her head or we dont get out!

531
01:03:10,594 --> 01:03:11,917
Just do it!

532
01:03:32,813 --> 01:03:33,897
Come in.

533
01:03:35,821 --> 01:03:37,693
Sir, thats Jill Tuck.

534
01:03:38,777 --> 01:03:41,946
Good evening.
Special agent Erickson.

535
01:03:41,947 --> 01:03:43,746
Thank you for seeing me so late today.

536
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:44,950
Not a problem.

537
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:46,451
That will be all.

538
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:50,263
Please, have a seat.

539
01:03:53,557 --> 01:03:55,836
So, what do you need from us?

540
01:03:55,956 --> 01:03:57,546
I think I'm being followed.

541
01:03:58,312 --> 01:04:00,695
Well, that sounds more like police work, Ms. Tuck.

542
01:04:02,336 --> 01:04:03,905
I don't think they can help me.

543
01:04:04,742 --> 01:04:05,788
Because...?

544
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,765
Because it's you. The FBI.

545
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:12,019
I dont understand.

546
01:04:12,251 --> 01:04:15,355
It started when John was first identified as Jigsaw killer.

547
01:04:15,778 --> 01:04:18,548
It didn't surprise me then, but I'm still being followed.

548
01:04:18,557 --> 01:04:21,327
By who, Ms. Tuck? 
Who would be following you?

549
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:24,573
I think it's the agent who interrogated me.

550
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,950
Agent Strahm.

551
01:04:28,423 --> 01:04:30,329
And why would he be following you?

552
01:04:30,776 --> 01:04:32,073
I don't know.

553
01:04:36,644 --> 01:04:38,542
Who else have you told about this?

554
01:04:38,795 --> 01:04:40,043
Only you.

555
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:07,236
What's going on with Amanda?

556
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:10,461
Didn't you tell me the only way to truly offer enlightment 

557
01:05:11,788 --> 01:05:14,267
is by detaching emotionally?

558
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:20,100
But you can have something Amanda doesn't.

559
01:05:20,462 --> 01:05:21,880
?A longevity?.

560
01:05:22,756 --> 01:05:24,341
Thats the greatest protection.

561
01:05:24,424 --> 01:05:26,093
That's what I've given you.

562
01:05:26,934 --> 01:05:29,137
I need you to set up a game.

563
01:05:30,576 --> 01:05:34,293
It may not be entirely clear, to you right now.

564
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:41,300
But I assure you the people being tested 
are a part of something much larger. 

565
01:05:42,459 --> 01:05:43,863
Theyre connected.

566
01:05:44,464 --> 01:05:46,265
So in the end,

567
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:49,200
all the pieces will fit together.

568
01:05:52,205 --> 01:05:54,103
And it'll be clear.

569
01:05:56,878 --> 01:05:58,060
<i>Who are you!</i>

570
01:05:58,433 --> 01:06:00,141
Amanda will fail you.

571
01:06:00,752 --> 01:06:01,920
We'll see.

572
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,423
<i>What are you doing?
What are you doing!</i>

573
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:12,723
- Whats this?
- Who are you?

574
01:06:12,727 --> 01:06:14,349
Its time to play a game.

575
01:06:17,134 --> 01:06:20,529
Help! Help me!
What is it?

576
01:06:20,761 --> 01:06:22,272
What is it Christ!

577
01:06:24,635 --> 01:06:29,200
Why are you keeping me here!
What is this place! What is this place!

578
01:07:02,805 --> 01:07:04,772
We were all supposed to die.

579
01:07:09,093 --> 01:07:11,020
Jigsaw is fucking testing you!

580
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:14,076
Where is my daughter!

581
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:20,796
He didnt make it.

582
01:07:21,832 --> 01:07:23,120
Nobody made it.

583
01:07:23,759 --> 01:07:26,123
You were supposed to be the hero!

584
01:08:29,471 --> 01:08:30,778
Peter, where the hell are you?

585
01:08:34,168 --> 01:08:35,240
Hello?

586
01:08:45,709 --> 01:08:50,172
You have reached the voicemail of a special agent Peter Strahm.
Leave a message.

587
01:08:53,342 --> 01:08:57,137
Cowan, I want to put a locate on Strahms mobile phone.

588
01:08:57,721 --> 01:08:59,119
Right away sir.

589
01:08:59,556 --> 01:09:00,895
Call me right back.

590
01:09:01,301 --> 01:09:02,376
All right.

591
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:17,963
...

592
01:09:36,828 --> 01:09:38,784
...

593
01:09:56,699 --> 01:09:58,442
There you are, Strahm.

594
01:09:59,188 --> 01:10:01,328
All right. Back up.

595
01:10:09,899 --> 01:10:11,255
What the hell is that?

596
01:10:11,712 --> 01:10:13,172
It's our next nightmare.

597
01:10:19,344 --> 01:10:21,330
There are blades in here.

598
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:27,868
It's connected to the door.

599
01:10:28,348 --> 01:10:31,118
When the beaker fills up, the door opens.

600
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:34,735
Fills with what?

601
01:10:36,173 --> 01:10:37,488
Blood.

602
01:10:38,071 --> 01:10:39,406
Our blood.

603
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:44,912
I'm thinking... our wrists are supposed to go in there 
and fill the beaker.

604
01:10:46,315 --> 01:10:49,134
Wait. Why can't we just use the water from the other room?

605
01:10:49,153 --> 01:10:53,670
No, it's locks are closed. 
We have to stick our arm in to keep them open but then they get stuck.

606
01:10:53,677 --> 01:10:55,547
We need to close that door.

607
01:10:57,435 --> 01:10:58,724
So what?

608
01:10:59,519 --> 01:11:01,494
We fight to the death and the...

609
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:04,429
the winner gets freedom 
with the other person's blood?

610
01:11:10,171 --> 01:11:11,647
Wait, wait, wait.

611
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:14,780
- Do you still have the keys from that first room?
- Yeah.

612
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,865
- Try one of them on that door.
- It wont work.

613
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:19,344
No, no. It might. 
This one has a keyhole.

614
01:11:25,205 --> 01:11:27,055
Its not even the same lock.

615
01:11:30,193 --> 01:11:32,701
Why are there five slots in this machine?

616
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:34,906
Shouldn't there be only one?

617
01:11:42,015 --> 01:11:43,904
They all would've worked.

618
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:47,975
- Where are you going?
- Hurry, before the bombs go off.

619
01:11:52,594 --> 01:11:54,681
I don't think this is a good idea.

620
01:11:55,011 --> 01:11:57,192
The tub wasn't meant for one person.

621
01:11:57,301 --> 01:12:01,196
We were supposed to hold one cable each
and suffer a small shock.

622
01:12:02,058 --> 01:12:05,367
It was meant for five people.
They all were, every game.

623
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:08,786
We only needed one key in the first room.

624
01:12:08,906 --> 01:12:12,029
They all worked and any one of them would've opened every collar.

625
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:16,248
In the second room, the three chambers 
were large enough for more than one person.

626
01:12:17,004 --> 01:12:20,345
We were supposed to work together so we all survived.

627
01:12:20,374 --> 01:12:22,050
Thats the game.

628
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:26,399
"Your lifelong instincts will tell you to do one thing 
but I implore you to do the opposite."

629
01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:28,153
Oh god. Whoops...

630
01:12:28,163 --> 01:12:31,222
Yeah, big fucking whoops.

631
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:48,125
Hello and welcome.

632
01:12:48,245 --> 01:12:50,466
This journey has been one of discovery 

633
01:12:50,476 --> 01:12:55,261
and hopefully you've discovered 
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

634
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:59,443
The human body, for instance, 
is an astoundingly durable creation.

635
01:12:59,453 --> 01:13:02,397
It contains approximately ten pints of blood. 

636
01:13:02,424 --> 01:13:06,591
Yet it is still able to operate with just half of that.

637
01:13:06,601 --> 01:13:09,545
The device before you is one of sacrifice.

638
01:13:09,555 --> 01:13:10,959
A sacrifice of blood.

639
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:15,833
In order to open the door, 
the beaker must be filled to the marked level.

640
01:13:15,843 --> 01:13:19,281
A level that is of no coincidence.

641
01:13:19,316 --> 01:13:23,142
This amount can come from anyone of you. 
That does not matter.

642
01:13:23,152 --> 01:13:25,411
What does matter is time. 

643
01:13:25,429 --> 01:13:29,768
For in 15 minutes, if the beaker is not filled, 
the bombs will explode

644
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:32,617
and the doors will be sealed forever.

645
01:13:32,627 --> 01:13:37,847
So now I ask you, 
how much blood will you give in order to survive?

646
01:13:43,674 --> 01:13:45,596
Fuck! Fuck!

647
01:13:45,877 --> 01:13:47,000
All right.

648
01:13:47,029 --> 01:13:51,473
So one person can fill the beaker 
with ten pints and die.

649
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:54,576
Or two people can fill it with 5 pints...

650
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:57,980
...and maybe live.

651
01:13:59,398 --> 01:14:01,181
What are we gonna do?

652
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:33,867
I lied.

653
01:15:35,317 --> 01:15:40,873
I know the investigative journalist in there.
His name was Charles, he was writing a story about what I did.

654
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:43,601
What'd you do?

655
01:15:46,025 --> 01:15:47,894
A dealer gave me...

656
01:15:48,339 --> 01:15:51,342
an ounce of heroin 
to burn down an abandoned building.

657
01:15:51,884 --> 01:15:53,076
But it was...

658
01:15:53,386 --> 01:15:57,357
Oh, god! It wasn't abandoned. 
There was eight people in there...eight people...

659
01:15:58,070 --> 01:15:59,285
...died.

660
01:15:59,934 --> 01:16:03,230
And the Feds got involved

661
01:16:03,683 --> 01:16:06,521
and I got caught but I made a deal 
and my dad got me off.

662
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:10,638
But the guy who hired me disappeared 
and nothing happened. Nothing happened.

663
01:16:27,130 --> 01:16:29,774
The fire. 
It's what connects us. 

664
01:16:30,349 --> 01:16:33,566
The fire inspector who worked 
a bogus accident report.

665
01:16:33,686 --> 01:16:37,192
The city planner who pushed through 
the residential permits.

666
01:16:37,312 --> 01:16:41,397
The journalist that beared the investigated story.

667
01:16:41,517 --> 01:16:44,901
The rich kid junkie who was the patsy.

668
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:48,132
And the real-estate developer who set it all in motion. 

669
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:52,863
We killed eight people 
and stole the property and nobody cared.

670
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:56,520
Why did they all do it? Was it for money? 
This was your plan?

671
01:16:56,783 --> 01:17:01,338
There was eight people still living in that building! 
You had to know that! Did you know that?!

672
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:13,978
I cant do this alone! Look at me!
I cant do this alone! I cant!

673
01:17:13,987 --> 01:17:15,634
- I cant!
- Ok, ok.

674
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:41,986
We have to do it on three.

675
01:17:59,922 --> 01:18:01,148
One!

676
01:18:08,658 --> 01:18:09,940
Two!

677
01:18:14,521 --> 01:18:16,822
I cant enter the hole!

678
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:28,601
Three!

679
01:19:54,767 --> 01:19:56,505
Hello agent Strahm.

680
01:19:56,753 --> 01:20:01,444
If you are hearing this, then you have once again 
found what you are looking for. 

681
01:20:01,661 --> 01:20:06,170
Or so you think. 
You dedication is to be commended.

682
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:10,766
But I ask you: 
have you learned anything in your journey of discovery?

683
01:20:11,115 --> 01:20:15,584
As the old addage goes, "Fool me once, shame on you".

684
01:20:15,704 --> 01:20:18,610
"Fool me twice, shame on me."

685
01:20:18,868 --> 01:20:23,202
The situation you find yourself in is one of trust.

686
01:20:23,322 --> 01:20:27,900
So I ask you, Special Agent Strahm: 
Have you learned to trust me?

687
01:20:27,925 --> 01:20:32,869
The only way to survive this room 
is by entering the glass box before you.

688
01:20:33,353 --> 01:20:38,669
Pain will be incurred, 
but you will have a chance of survival.

689
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:56,021
We did it.

690
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,316
We won. We won.

691
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:48,381
I got you, you motherfucker!

692
01:23:10,014 --> 01:23:12,500
Drop it!
I said drop it!

693
01:23:19,883 --> 01:23:23,402
Who did this to you?
Who did this to you?

694
01:23:25,785 --> 01:23:28,564
We won. We won.

695
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:31,121
We worked together...

696
01:23:31,513 --> 01:23:33,073
...in it...

697
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:46,032
I need immediate medical assistance.
1293 Sandhurst Dr.

698
01:24:26,525 --> 01:24:28,061
Jesus, Peter.

699
01:24:42,635 --> 01:24:44,096
Tell me how to open it.

700
01:24:44,751 --> 01:24:46,566
How do I open it?

701
01:24:58,406 --> 01:25:02,611
However, if you choose not to, 
you will never be heard from again.

702
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:06,994
Your body will never be found. 
You will simply vanish.

703
01:25:07,668 --> 01:25:10,593
I ask you, Special Agent Strahm:

704
01:25:10,825 --> 01:25:13,489
Have you learned enough to trust me?

705
01:25:13,498 --> 01:25:17,615
- Will you heed my warning? For if you do not...
- Fuck you.

706
01:25:17,648 --> 01:25:20,296
...this room will forever be your tomb.

707
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:23,582
And my legacy will become yours.

708
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:26,420
If you're good at anticipating the human mind...

709
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:27,836
I think Im being followed.

710
01:25:27,878 --> 01:25:29,250
Who would be following you?

711
01:25:29,255 --> 01:25:31,644
I want to talk to Jill Tuck one last time.

712
01:25:31,658 --> 01:25:34,118
He suspected someone on the inside.

713
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:38,670
It leaves nothing to chance.

714
01:25:42,226 --> 01:25:44,239
We were all supposed to die.

715
01:25:45,072 --> 01:25:47,484
You were supposed to be the hero.

716
01:25:50,352 --> 01:25:52,347
Make your choice.

717
01:25:56,855 --> 01:25:59,601
Cowan, it is Ericksson.

718
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:02,037
I want you to put out an A.P.B.

719
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:04,957
Suspects name is Peter Strahm.

720
01:26:05,849 --> 01:26:07,292
Yeah, that's right.

721
01:26:07,961 --> 01:26:09,837
Special Agent Peter Strahm.

722
01:26:32,177 --> 01:26:35,054
Tell me how to stop it you son of a bitch!

723
01:26:37,902 --> 01:26:40,914
I know who you are!
I know!

724
01:27:22,590 --> 01:27:26,928
