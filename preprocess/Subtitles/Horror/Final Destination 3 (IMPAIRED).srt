Let's go with what
you guys are saying.

1246
01:03:55,394 --> 01:03:56,727
Let's just say,
you know,

1247
01:03:56,729 --> 01:03:59,197
that death does have
a conscious plan

1248
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:01,565
and that it's been
set into motion. Great.

1249
01:04:01,567 --> 01:04:03,767
So, Newton's third
law of motion,

1250
01:04:03,769 --> 01:04:05,002
and, well, look,

1251

I'm just guessing that
it goes for death, too,

when he's working
in our world.

1253
01:04:08,507 --> 01:04:10,774
Newton says
that every action

1254
01:04:10,776 --> 01:04:12,476
has an equal and
opposite reaction.

1255
01:04:12,478 --> 01:04:15,563
So, that means that

1256
01:04:15,565 --> 01:04:19,500
if death has taken
action so can we.

1257
01:04:19,502 --> 01:04:21,736
And that that action
we take might have

1258
01:04:21,738 --> 01:04:24,338
an opposite reaction that
thwarts death's intent.
