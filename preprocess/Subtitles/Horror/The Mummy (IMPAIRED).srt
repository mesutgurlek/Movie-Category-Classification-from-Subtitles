1
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:10,525
Trying to teach me
a lesson in patience, Sir Joseph?

2
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:12,645
Method is everything in archaeology.

3
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:15,125
We always deal with
our finds of the day in order.

4
00:02:15,205 --> 00:02:17,925
Well, it seems to me
that that box we dug up today,

5
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,565
with the very peculiar
gentleman over there,

6
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:22,845
is the only find we've made in two months

7
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:26,085
that'll bring this expedition
medals from the British Museum.

8
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:29,125
We didn't come
to dig in Egypt for medals.

9
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:31,685
Much more is learned
from bits of broken pottery

10
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:34,005
than from all the sensational finds.

11
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:37,205
Our job is to increase
the sum of human knowledge of the past,

12
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:39,165
not to satisfy our own curiosity.

13
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:43,125
Oh, that's all very true, Sir Joseph,
but, after all, we're human.

14
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,405
- And a find like this! How can you wait?
- This is your first trip.

15
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:49,845
I've been here ten years. I'm more
curious about the mummy than you.

16
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:52,005
And even more about that box.

17
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:53,845
- Whemple.
- Yes?

18
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:55,965
The viscera were not removed.

19
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:59,165
The usual scar made
by the embalmer's knife is not there.

20
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,765
I guessed as much, Muller.

21
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:06,165
(whistles)

22
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:08,925
I had a good look at him
when I photographed him.

23
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,245
Never saw a mummy like that.

24
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,725
Neither, I imagine, has anyone else.

25
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:18,205
Looks as though he died in some
sensationally unpleasant manner.

26
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:23,925
The contorted muscles show
that he struggled in the bandages.

27
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:26,005
Buried alive?

28
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:31,125
"Imhotep".

29
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:35,685
"High Priest of
the Temple of the Sun at Karnak".

30
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:40,765
Poor old fella. Now, what could you have
done to make 'em treat you like that?

31
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,165
An execution for treason, I suppose.

32
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:46,445
Sacrilege, more likely.

33
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:51,525
Look. Sacred spells which protect
the soul in its journey to the underworld

34
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:53,805
have been chipped off the coffin.

35
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:58,085
So Imhotep was sentenced to death
not only in this world, but in the next.

36
00:03:58,165 --> 00:04:01,605
Maybe he got too gay
with the vestal virgins in the temple.

37
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:06,165
Possibly. The priestesses of the Temple
of Karnak were daughters of the Pharaoh.

38
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,245
They were the secret virgins of Isis.

39
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:11,605
Maybe the answer's
in that box we found buried with him.

40
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,885
I see I shall get no more work
out of you until after it's open.

41
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:18,445
- Come on.
- Let's have the box.

42
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:23,365
Oh dear. The wood's so rotten
it'll fall apart at a touch.

43
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,125
Whatever it is, it's terribly heavy.

44
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:36,885
Metal. Looks like copper.

45
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,285
It's gold.

46
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:50,285
I say. Look here.

47
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:54,125
The unbroken seals
of the Pharaoh Amenophis.

48
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:56,605
Some temple treasure.

49
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:28,325
"Death, eternal punishment, for...
anyone... who... opens... this... casket. "

50
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:33,605
"In the name of Amon-Ra,
the king of the gods. "

51
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:37,485
Good heavens, what a terrible curse!

52
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:40,725
- Well, let's see what's inside!
- Wait!

53
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:43,365
You will break the curse.

54
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:47,045
We recognise your mastery
of the occult sciences, Muller.

55
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,525
But your beliefs can't
interfere with my work.

56
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:53,085
- Then why did you send for me today?
- As a friend and an expert.

57
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:55,765
This find was unique
and I wanted your opinion.

58
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:58,525
- It's providential that you did.
- Oh, come, Dr Muller.

59
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:02,405
Surely a few thousand years in the earth
take the mumbo jumbo off any old curse.

60
00:06:02,485 --> 00:06:04,405
Oh, I cannot speak before a boy.

61
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:07,285
Come out under the stars of Egypt.

62
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:11,245
Do not touch that casket.

63
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:18,365
Go on with your cataloguing.
We'll open it later.

64
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,765
Don't think you can
persuade me not to examine

65
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:24,405
the most wonderful find
of my whole experience out here.

66
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:38,645
If you are right about the legend, then this
casket may contain the Scroll of Thoth,

67
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:42,565
from the holy of holies in the temple, and
I can hardly wait to get back to find out.

68
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:46,405
The gods of Egypt still live in these hills,
in their ruined temples.

69
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:49,685
The ancient spells are weaker,
but some of them are still potent.

70
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:53,045
And I believe that you have
in your hut the Scroll of Thoth itself,

71
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,805
which contains the great spell with which
Isis raised Osiris from the dead.

72
00:08:58,925 --> 00:09:01,925
Put it back. Bury it where you found it.

73
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:05,005
You have read the curse. You dare defy
it?

74
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:08,605
In the interests of science,
even if I believed in the curse,

75
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:10,885
I'd go on with my work for the museum.

76
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:14,245
Come back with me and we'll
examine this great find together.

77
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:17,885
I cannot condone
an act of sacrilege with my presence.

78
00:10:45,165 --> 00:10:47,165
(laughs hysterically)

79
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:09,285
(laughter gets louder)

80
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:14,045
What's the matter, man?
For heaven's sakes, what is it?

81
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:17,725
He... He went for a little walk!

82
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:21,005
You should have seen his face!

83
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,885
(laughter continues)

84
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:13,965
Here's something to break the monotony.
A visitor coming from the Nile.

85
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:17,245
- Colour? Nationality?
- How could I see in that glare?

86
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:19,565
Well, Whemple, back we go to London.

87
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:24,645
And what fools we look. Money wasted.
Hole after hole dug in this blasted desert.

88
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,245
A few beads. A few broken pots.

89
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:30,125
A man needs more
than hard work for this game.

90
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:33,565
He needs flair.
He needs luck. Like your father.

91
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:36,365
When he came here,
there wasn't so much competition.

92
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:42,165
When he did, he found things. And once,
ten years ago, he found too much.

93
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:47,165
Was it ten years? Queer story, that young
Oxford chap he had with him going mad.

94
00:12:47,245 --> 00:12:49,245
- You know what I think it was?
- No. What?

95
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:53,765
He went crazy. Bored beyond human
endurance in this sand and these rocks.

96
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:58,765
He was laughing when your father found
him. He died laughing, in a straitjacket.

97
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,765
Your father never explained.

98
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:05,285
But when the best excavator England
has turned out, a man who loved Egypt,

99
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:08,605
said he'd never come back here,
that meant something.

100
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:13,645
(knocking)

101
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:16,285
Come in.

102
00:13:24,925 --> 00:13:28,005
You break your season's camp,
Professor Pearson?

103
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:30,485
Your colleagues
have returned to London?

104
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:34,085
Yes. Whemple and I
stayed behind to clear up.

105
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:36,845
Your expedition has not been a success.

106
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:40,765
(laughs) Scarcely.
Here are the season's finds.

107
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,765
Permit me to present you
with the most sensational find

108
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:47,085
since that of Tutankhamen.

109
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:49,685
This is very sporting of you!
May I ask why?

110
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:54,365
We Egyptians are not permitted
to dig up our ancient dead.

111
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:57,245
Only... foreign museums.

112
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,005
What's this?

113
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:04,045
Part of the funerary equipment
of the princess Anck-es-en-Amon.

114
00:14:04,805 --> 00:14:08,725
- Daughter of Amenophis the Magnificent.
- Yes. It's her name.

115
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:12,805
I found that not 100 yards
from where we are.

116
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:16,845
- You mean you think her tomb is there?
- I will show you where to dig.

117
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,325
I'm sure it's very good of you, Mr... ?
I didn't catch your name.

118
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:24,405
Ardath Bey.

119
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:43,885
Circumstantial evidence.
Not very strong, perhaps.

120
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:46,845
But if we put that gang
of diggers from Kerma on the job,

121
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:49,685
we can tell in two days
if there's anything here.

122
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,525
In one day, Professor.

123
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:00,925
(singing)

124
00:15:19,645 --> 00:15:21,645
(shouts in Arabic)

125
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:35,445
- It's a step.
- He was right.

126
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:37,525
Anyhow, we've found something.

127
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:40,165
(speaks Arabic)

128
00:15:40,245 --> 00:15:42,445
(shouting in Arabic)

129
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:04,885
- The name of Anck-es-en-Amon.
- We will cable your father in London.

130
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:07,725
He must be here when
we examine this great find.

131
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,805
The seal of the seven jackals.

132
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,885
And it's unbroken.

133
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:21,685
No one has entered this door since
the priests of the royal acropolis sealed it.

134
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:25,725
3700 years ago.

135
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:07,005
Is there a view like this
in all the world, Helen?

136
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:09,085
The real Egypt.

137
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:17,285
Are we really in
this dreadful modern Cairo?

138
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:21,405
Your thoughts are far from the dance
and these nice English boys.

139
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:23,925
Not really. I'm having a lovely time.

140
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:26,045
- I'm so grateful.
- But why?

141
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,165
Your keeping me here with you, of
course.

142
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:31,845
So I don't have to go up to Father
in that beastly hot Sudan.

143
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:35,485
It's I who am grateful.
My most interesting patient.

144
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:43,525
Know who that is?

145
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,525
- Muller of Vienna.
- Really?

146
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:50,605
Always spends his winters here.
Authority on Egyptian occult.

147
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:52,845
- Yes, but the girl?
- Helen Grosvenor.

148
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:57,005
Her father's governor of the Sudan.
English, of course. Her mother, Egyptian.

149
00:18:57,085 --> 00:19:01,085
Some old family with a tree a mile long.
She's staying here with Dr and Mrs
Muller.

150
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:03,165
(gong)

151
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:16,525
Pardon me, sir. Our closing bell has rung.

152
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:18,405
I did not notice the time.

153
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:22,725
- I am addressing Sir Joseph Whemple?
- Yes.

154
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:26,405
- I am Ardath Bey.
- Indeed!

155
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,685
Why, we have you to thank
that we have this exhibit here at all.

156
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:35,845
The museum should be kept open
all night in your honour.

157
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,525
Won't you come down to my office?
I'm working here late.

158
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:41,765
Your pardon. I dislike to be touched.

159
00:19:42,445 --> 00:19:44,445
An Eastern prejudice.

160
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:54,965
Won't you sit down?

161
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:59,445
You know my son?

162
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:05,805
Ardath Bey. Where did you disappear
to when we opened the tomb?

163
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:08,365
I returned to Cairo.

164
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:11,645
But... but now I must not detain you.

165
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:15,045
But I must see you again.
You must come to my house.

166
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,565
I regret I am too occupied
to accept invitations.

167
00:20:25,885 --> 00:20:28,125
He's a strange one.

168
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:31,965
You might have thanked him. He was
responsible for finding the princess.

169
00:20:32,045 --> 00:20:33,965
Yes. I rather wish he hadn't been.

170
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:36,965
It's a dirty trick,
Cairo Museum keeping what we've found.

171
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:41,805
That was the contract. The British
Museum works for science, not for loot.

172
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,125
(chants softly)

173
00:21:21,005 --> 00:21:23,005
Anck-es-en-Amon.

174
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:26,005
Anck-es-en-Amon.

175
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,085
Anck-es-en-Amon.

176
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,205
Is anything the matter?

177
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:38,565
Anck-es-en-Amon.

178
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:57,565
Anck-es-en-Amon.

179
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:25,365
Where do you want to go, miss?

180
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:28,085
Le musee des Antiquites.

181
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:30,605
Le musee des Antiquites.

182
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:36,445
Imhotep.

183
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:39,405
Anck-es-en-Amon.

184
00:22:40,165 --> 00:22:41,565
Anck-es-en-Amon.

185
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:44,125
Imhotep.

186
00:22:44,205 --> 00:22:48,365
(chants in ancient Egyptian) Imhotep.

187
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:17,965
I must get in.

188
00:23:18,285 --> 00:23:19,885
Anck-es-en-Amon.

189
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,805
- I must!
- It's closed for the night. They've gone.

190
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:24,885
I must get in.

191
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:48,325
Imhotep. Imhotep.

192
00:23:49,605 --> 00:23:51,605
(chants in ancient Egyptian)

193
00:23:53,485 --> 00:23:55,485
Imhotep.

194
00:23:56,285 --> 00:24:00,645
- What's she saying?
- (speaks ancient Egyptian)

195
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:03,325
What language is that?

196
00:24:03,805 --> 00:24:08,445
The language of ancient Egypt.
Not heard on this earth for 2000 years.

197
00:24:11,165 --> 00:24:15,325
And the name of a man unspoken
since before the siege of Troy.

198
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:46,485
(shouts in Arabic)

199
00:24:48,005 --> 00:24:50,005
(shouts)

200
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:52,085
(choking noises)

201
00:24:54,805 --> 00:24:55,845
(crash)

202
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:02,005
- Is your master at home?
- Yes, sir.

203
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,805
Tell him Dr Muller wishes
to see him urgently.

204
00:25:11,565 --> 00:25:15,365
- How did I get here?
- We brought you here. Father and I.

205
00:25:15,445 --> 00:25:17,445
You fainted.

206
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:23,685
But how did you guess she was here?

207
00:25:23,765 --> 00:25:27,165
I discovered that she took a taxi
from the hotel to the museum.

208
00:25:27,245 --> 00:25:30,565
I went there. The watchman said
she had left in your car.

209
00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:37,365
Before you take her away, I must talk
to you about something she said just now.

210
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:47,845
- Oh, Dr Muller.
- Oh, here you are, my dear.

211
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:51,125
I suppose you introduced yourself?

212
00:25:51,205 --> 00:25:56,845
No? Miss Helen Grosvenor, my old friend
Sir Joseph Whemple, Frank Whemple.

213
00:25:56,925 --> 00:26:00,005
That seems so formal under
these peculiar circumstances.

214
00:26:00,085 --> 00:26:03,245
And now, if you're all right again,
back we go to the hotel.

215
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:06,085
I think she'll want to rest a few minutes.

216
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:12,325
Frank, will you make yourself agreeable?

217
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:19,045
Well...

218
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,765
Where was I when I fainted, Mr Whemple?

219
00:26:21,845 --> 00:26:26,325
- Oh, outside the museum.
- What was I doing there?

220
00:26:26,405 --> 00:26:29,725
Well, I wouldn't know that, would I?

221
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:34,045
No, I don't suppose you would.
I wish I did.

222
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,125
- I was waiting...
- Don't talk about it.

223
00:26:36,205 --> 00:26:38,205
Oh, right.

224
00:26:43,365 --> 00:26:46,605
- You're partly Egyptian, aren't you?
- Yes.

225
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:48,685
How did you guess that?

226
00:26:49,365 --> 00:26:52,925
Well, I don't know.
Just something about you.

227
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:56,605
I'd have liked Egypt better
if I'd met you there.

228
00:26:56,685 --> 00:27:00,845
No such luck! Stuck in the desert
for two months, and was it hot!

229
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:03,005
- That tomb.
- What tomb?

230
00:27:04,365 --> 00:27:06,805
Surely you read about the princess?

231
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:08,805
- So you did that?
- Yes.

232
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:11,725
The 1 4 steps down
and the unbroken seals were thrilling.

233
00:27:11,805 --> 00:27:16,045
But when we came to handle all her
clothes, her jewels and her toilet things...

234
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,685
They buried everything
with them they used in life.

235
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:22,725
- When we came to unwrap the girl...
- How could you do that?

236
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:25,245
Had to! Science, you know!

237
00:27:25,325 --> 00:27:29,365
Well, after we'd worked among her things,
I felt as if I'd known her.

238
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:33,845
But when we got the wrappings off,
and I saw her face...

239
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:37,325
You'll think me silly,
but I sort of fell in love with her.

240
00:27:38,485 --> 00:27:42,005
Do you have to open graves
to find girls to fall in love with?

241
00:27:44,485 --> 00:27:48,725
I say. Now I know what it is about you.

242
00:27:50,725 --> 00:27:53,445
There was something about her head...

243
00:27:53,725 --> 00:27:56,805
I had never mentioned the name,
yet I heard Miss Grosvenor

244
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:00,125
mutter in ancient Egyptian
something about Imhotep.

245
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:02,205
Imhotep?

246
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:08,525
What was this Ardath
doing in the museum?

247
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:12,565
Looking at the mummy.
Just at closing time.

248
00:28:12,645 --> 00:28:14,645
(phone rings)

249
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:17,605
Hello?

250
00:28:17,685 --> 00:28:19,685
What?

251
00:28:20,605 --> 00:28:22,605
Il est mort?

252
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:26,245
Tout de suite, effendi.

253
00:28:27,485 --> 00:28:31,125
Come. A museum guard found dead
in the room with the princess.

254
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,085
Fear. Fear.

255
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:47,325
So he died of shock.

256
00:28:47,405 --> 00:28:49,885
We find this in dead guard's hand,
Sir Joseph.

257
00:28:49,965 --> 00:28:54,085
Probably thief tried to steal it.
Guard take it away, thief kill him.

258
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:58,005
The cause of death, I not find nothing.

259
00:28:58,845 --> 00:29:02,325
Looks like an attempted theft, but
nothing stolen here could be sold.

260
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:04,405
What is the document?

261
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:28,445
Let me put this here.
You'll be more comfortable.

262
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:30,885
Thanks.

263
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:34,805
You really want to know why
I didn't take you to the hospital?

264
00:29:34,885 --> 00:29:39,005
- Because, when I held you in my arms...
- Hadn't you better not commit yourself?

265
00:29:39,085 --> 00:29:43,005
What girl could not make a conquest who
collapsed at a man's feet in moonlight?

266
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:47,845
It seems absurd when we've known each
other such a short time, but I'm serious.

267
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:50,205
Haven't I had enough
excitement for one evening,

268
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:53,605
without the additional thrill
of a strange man making love to me?

269
00:29:53,685 --> 00:29:56,885
But I've never been serious
about this sort of thing before.

270
00:29:56,965 --> 00:30:01,805
Now, look here. You can tell me to go
to the devil, but you can't laugh at me.

271
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:12,445
The curse has struck her, and now,
through her, it will strike my son.

272
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:14,245
Quiet.

273
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:17,805
Frank, will you come
to your father's study?

274
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:20,565
Helen, I shall take you home presently.

275
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,365
I'll be back in a minute.

276
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:39,765
Imhotep was alive
when that mummy in the museum

277
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:41,645
was a vestal virgin in the temple.

278
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:44,885
3700 years ago!
What's that got to do with us now?

279
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:47,205
Your assistant who went insane and died,

280
00:30:47,285 --> 00:30:49,485
as you might have
if you'd seen what he saw,

281
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:52,365
made a transcription of part of that scroll.

282
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:55,165
Yes. I have it still.

283
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:59,805
You seem to think it has all the devils of
hell in it. Burn it and be done with it.

284
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:01,885
An excellent suggestion.

285
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,725
What became of the mummy of Imhotep?

286
00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:08,245
Somebody stole it!

287
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,765
Look, what's the matter
with Miss Grosvenor?

288
00:31:11,845 --> 00:31:15,125
You still think that
that mummy was stolen, Sir Joseph?

289
00:31:16,245 --> 00:31:20,725
Yes. I... I really don't know.

290
00:31:39,805 --> 00:31:41,805
(chants in ancient Egyptian)

291
00:32:36,845 --> 00:32:40,005
A thousand pardons. I am Ardath Bey.

292
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:45,965
I am Helen Grosvenor.

293
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:49,045
I called to see Sir Joseph.

294
00:32:50,445 --> 00:32:54,125
- He's in the study.
- In conference?

295
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,205
If I might perhaps wait?

296
00:32:57,525 --> 00:33:00,045
Yes. Of course.

297
00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:09,165
Have we not met before, Miss Grosvenor?

298
00:33:09,245 --> 00:33:12,565
No. I don't think so.

299
00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:17,805
I don't think one would forget
meeting you, Ardath Bey.

300
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:19,885
Then I am mistaken.

301
00:33:21,325 --> 00:33:23,365
But you are of our blood.

302
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:25,445
As to that, I am not mistaken.

303
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:30,845
Yes. My mother was Egyptian.

304
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:33,485
You must burn the Scroll of Thoth!

305
00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:37,125
I tell you,
it's the museum's property, not mine.

306
00:33:37,205 --> 00:33:39,365
Who's out there with Miss Grosvenor?

307
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:46,365
Ardath Bey!

308
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:48,445
He's come for the scroll.

309
00:34:10,085 --> 00:34:12,525
Ardath Bey, Dr Muller.

310
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:19,885
I accept your invitation. But I find
no solitary student with his books.

311
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:21,965
I fear my visit is inopportune.

312
00:34:22,045 --> 00:34:25,085
On the contrary.
We were just talking about...

313
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:27,205
- Me?
- Your native Egypt.

314
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:30,725
You know Miss Grosvenor?

315
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:33,365
Ardath Bey introduced himself.

316
00:34:35,165 --> 00:34:37,165
Won't you be seated?

317
00:34:51,045 --> 00:34:53,165
Sir Joseph was just
wondering how you knew

318
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:56,205
where the tomb of the princess
Anck-es-en-Amon was hidden.

319
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:59,325
Partly inference, partly chance.

320
00:35:01,285 --> 00:35:03,725
Sir Joseph, you seem disturbed.

321
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:08,885
Yes. A tragedy at the museum
after you left.

322
00:35:10,085 --> 00:35:12,445
Tragedy?

323
00:35:12,525 --> 00:35:14,525
When I was there...

324
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:17,525
When you were there, Miss Grosvenor?

325
00:35:19,245 --> 00:35:23,125
Yes. They told me I went there
and tried to get in after it was closed.

326
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:25,365
I don't remember, but...

327
00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:27,445
Helen, it is very late.

328
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,725
Frank, will you please
see Helen back to the hotel?

329
00:35:30,805 --> 00:35:34,525
- Certainly, if Miss Grosvenor will let me.
- I don't want to go.

330
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:38,165
After what happened, you need rest badly.

331
00:35:38,245 --> 00:35:43,925
But I don't. I was tired, but...

332
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:45,965
Why, I've never felt so alive before!

333
00:35:46,045 --> 00:35:48,925
- As your doctor, I must order you to go.
- I'm not a child.

334
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:51,005
Yes, please come.

335
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:56,005
Then, Ardath Bey, au revoir.

336
00:35:56,085 --> 00:35:58,085
We must see each other again.

337
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,525
I shall be honoured.

338
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:24,845
An unusual crime. A guard killed
by a man who left a gift to the museum.

339
00:36:24,925 --> 00:36:26,925
- A gift?
- A scroll.

340
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:30,685
Part of which was transcribed
when it was first found.

341
00:36:30,765 --> 00:36:32,805
Here is the transcription.

342
00:36:36,165 --> 00:36:39,205
I cannot read the writing
of a period so remote.

343
00:36:39,285 --> 00:36:42,205
But you read "Anck-es-en-Amon"
on that piece of pottery.

344
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:44,285
That was of the 18th dynasty.

345
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:46,885
These are pre-dynastic ideographs.

346
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:50,245
The scroll from which this
was copied was stolen ten years ago,

347
00:36:50,325 --> 00:36:53,325
together with the mummy
of the high priest Imhotep.

348
00:36:53,405 --> 00:36:55,565
Most interesting.

349
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:58,605
May I see that scroll, Sir Joseph?

350
00:36:59,045 --> 00:37:02,045
We left it at the... museum.

351
00:37:02,285 --> 00:37:05,205
- So.
- I have something else to show you.

352
00:37:06,085 --> 00:37:08,085
A photograph.

353
00:37:12,045 --> 00:37:14,045
Why do you show all this to me?

354
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:18,125
Do you think it conceivable
that the mummy was not stolen,

355
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:21,165
but given a semblance
of life by the spell of the scroll.

356
00:37:21,245 --> 00:37:24,205
That scroll is my property.
I bought it from a dealer.

357
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:28,165
It is here in this house.
I presume, in that room.

358
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:33,125
(chants in ancient Egyptian)

359
00:37:33,445 --> 00:37:35,645
We had foreseen this.

360
00:37:35,725 --> 00:37:37,765
The scroll is in safe hands.

361
00:37:37,845 --> 00:37:42,525
It will be destroyed the minute
it is known that harm has come to us.

362
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:46,805
You have studied our ancient arts,
and you know that you cannot harm me.

363
00:37:46,885 --> 00:37:50,325
You also know that you must
return that scroll to me or die.

364
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:55,405
Now tell that weak fool
to get that scroll, wherever it is,

365
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:58,605
and hand it to his Nubian servant.

366
00:37:59,285 --> 00:38:02,165
- The Nubian!
- The ancient blood.

367
00:38:04,285 --> 00:38:06,405
So you have made him your slave.

368
00:38:08,045 --> 00:38:15,005
If I could get my hands on you,
I'd break your dried flesh to pieces.

369
00:38:17,685 --> 00:38:19,765
But your power is too strong.

370
00:38:35,005 --> 00:38:38,125
This is the evil force
that has been attacking her.

371
00:38:38,205 --> 00:38:41,005
Burn the scroll, man. Burn it!

372
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,205
It was through you
this horror came into existence.

373
00:38:44,285 --> 00:38:47,685
It's true. It's true.

374
00:39:17,285 --> 00:39:19,285
(chants in ancient Egyptian)

375
00:40:45,005 --> 00:40:49,645
Your father destroyed the scroll,
knowing that it would cost him his life.

376
00:40:52,765 --> 00:40:54,885
What's that?

377
00:40:54,965 --> 00:41:00,645
Isis. The Egyptian symbol of life.
I meant it for your father.

378
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:03,325
What good could
that old charm have done him?

379
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:08,045
I tell you, the doctors say
it's plainly heart failure.

380
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,045
The Nubian is missing.

381
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:12,965
He's an old servant. He's frightened.

382
00:41:13,045 --> 00:41:15,045
He'll be back.

383
00:41:15,925 --> 00:41:19,765
Don't try and make me believe that this
Ardath fellow is a mummy come to life.

384
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:22,325
That idea, and the horror of it,
killed my father.

385
00:41:22,405 --> 00:41:25,925
The museum guard
died of natural causes, too.

386
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:28,165
Frank, I need your help.

387
00:41:28,245 --> 00:41:31,965
I saw your attraction
to my patient last night, and hers to you.

388
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:36,645
- Hers to me? Do you really think so?
- And I welcomed it.

389
00:41:36,725 --> 00:41:40,525
But do you think I have a chance?
Cos I think she's the most won...

390
00:41:42,445 --> 00:41:46,085
- Oh, but this is terrible at a time like this...
- Frank, I'm afraid.

391
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:50,765
- Will you go with me to her now?
- Yes.

392
00:41:50,845 --> 00:41:54,365
Then telephone her first,
not to leave the hotel.

393
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,565
9590.

394
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:12,405
No. I'm not going out.

395
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:17,445
Yes. I promise to wait until you get here.

396
00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:22,565
Goodbye. And I'm so dreadfully sorry.

397
00:42:48,925 --> 00:42:51,085
What were you doing, Doctor?

398
00:42:51,165 --> 00:42:53,845
Your father did not burn
the Scroll of Thoth.

399
00:42:53,925 --> 00:42:56,285
That creature has it now.

400
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,125
- The ashes in the fireplace!
- They were newspaper.

401
00:42:59,205 --> 00:43:01,165
The scroll is papyrus.

402
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,805
Then it was murder? The Nubian!

403
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:08,845
Wear this around your neck.

404
00:43:11,085 --> 00:43:13,725
- Why?
- When we fight this creature,

405
00:43:13,805 --> 00:43:17,365
we must ask protection
from the forces of all that it defied.

406
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:21,285
- I'll give it to Helen. She needs protection.
- No, her life is not in danger.

407
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,125
It is her soul.

408
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:27,285
Should love for you come to her,
he will try to destroy you.

409
00:43:27,365 --> 00:43:31,925
That amulet, the Egyptians believed,
was a charm against evil sendings,

410
00:43:32,005 --> 00:43:34,205
such as struck down your father.

411
00:44:33,565 --> 00:44:35,885
(dog barks)

412
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:40,165
Your dog is frightened.

413
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:42,445
My servant will see to him.

414
00:44:47,245 --> 00:44:49,245
Sit down, Miss Grosvenor.

415
00:44:55,885 --> 00:44:58,285
Ancient Egypt.

416
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:00,365
Nothing modern.

417
00:45:08,885 --> 00:45:11,085
What a strange incense.

418
00:45:11,165 --> 00:45:13,165
Is it not familiar to you?

419
00:45:14,365 --> 00:45:17,085
- No.
- Our forefathers used it.

420
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:20,405
Yours and mine.

421
00:45:24,525 --> 00:45:27,485
You will not remember
what I show you now,

422
00:45:27,765 --> 00:45:35,005
and yet I shall awaken memories
of love and crime and death.

423
00:46:06,005 --> 00:46:08,325
(Ardath Bey) l knelt by the bed of death.

424
00:46:40,605 --> 00:46:43,805
Thy father's last farewell.

425
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:51,965
l knew the Scroll of Thoth
could bring thee back to life.

426
00:48:10,285 --> 00:48:14,325
l dared the god's anger, and stole it.

427
00:48:18,725 --> 00:48:22,525
l stole back to thy tomb
to bring thee back to life.

428
00:48:23,605 --> 00:48:26,485
l murmured the spell that raises the dead.

429
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:32,645
They broke in upon me
and found me doing an unholy thing.

430
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,925
Thy father condemned me
to the nameless death.

431
00:48:51,005 --> 00:48:52,885
The scroll he ordered buried with me,

432
00:48:52,965 --> 00:48:56,285
that no such sacrilege
might disgrace Egypt again.

433
00:50:58,005 --> 00:51:02,405
A nameless grave. The slaves were killed
so that none should know.

434
00:51:03,325 --> 00:51:06,565
The soldiers who killed them
were also slain,

435
00:51:06,645 --> 00:51:08,565
so no friend could creep to the desert

436
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:11,965
with funeral offerings
for my condemned spirit.

437
00:51:20,765 --> 00:51:22,765
Anck-es-en-Amon.

438
00:51:24,845 --> 00:51:28,165
My love has lasted longer
than the temples of our gods.

439
00:51:29,325 --> 00:51:31,765
No man ever suffered as I did for you.

440
00:51:32,565 --> 00:51:34,965
The rest you may not know.

441
00:51:35,045 --> 00:51:40,165
Not until you are about to pass through
the great night of terror and triumph,

442
00:51:40,245 --> 00:51:44,445
until you are ready to face moments
of horror for an eternity of love,

443
00:51:46,005 --> 00:51:48,645
until I send back
your spirit, that has wandered

444
00:51:48,725 --> 00:51:51,645
through so many forms
and so many ages.

445
00:51:53,805 --> 00:51:58,045
But, before then,
Bast must again send forth death.

446
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,685
Death to that boy for whom
love is creeping into your heart.

447
00:52:02,005 --> 00:52:04,405
Love that would keep you from myself.

448
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:08,925
Love that might bring
sickness and even death to you.

449
00:52:11,965 --> 00:52:13,965
Awake.

450
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,885
Have I been asleep?

451
00:52:22,125 --> 00:52:24,405
I had strange dreams.

452
00:52:25,445 --> 00:52:28,925
Dreams of ancient Egypt, I think.
There was someone like you in them.

453
00:52:29,005 --> 00:52:31,365
My pool is sometimes troubled.

454
00:52:31,445 --> 00:52:35,845
One sees strange fantasies in the water.
But they pass like dreams.

455
00:52:35,925 --> 00:52:37,085
(howling)

456
00:52:37,165 --> 00:52:40,405
My dog! Wolfram! Wolfram!

457
00:52:40,485 --> 00:52:42,485
Where is he?

458
00:52:52,645 --> 00:52:54,645
Helen.

459
00:52:59,565 --> 00:53:01,885
Helen! Where have you been?

460
00:53:03,205 --> 00:53:06,285
We've been so worried.
We've hunted everywhere.

461
00:53:06,365 --> 00:53:08,365
- In the museum again?
- Yes.

462
00:53:08,445 --> 00:53:10,485
Muller's down in the Arab quarter now.

463
00:53:10,565 --> 00:53:13,485
Well, if I must give an explanation,
it was stuffy in here.

464
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:18,525
I can't be shut up all the time. And I don't
like the feeling I'm always being watched.

465
00:53:18,605 --> 00:53:21,285
- I took the dog with me.
- Where is the dog?

466
00:53:28,885 --> 00:53:31,005
He's dead.

467
00:53:31,685 --> 00:53:35,405
- But how?
- I don't know.

468
00:53:35,485 --> 00:53:38,165
- Well, where?
- I don't remember.

469
00:53:39,045 --> 00:53:41,045
But I can see it now.

470
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:43,285
Standing on poor Wolfram's back.

471
00:53:43,365 --> 00:53:45,405
- A white cat.
- A white cat?

472
00:53:46,405 --> 00:53:48,525
The cat-goddess Bast!

473
00:53:49,085 --> 00:53:51,405
Yes, there was a statue of Bast.

474
00:53:51,485 --> 00:53:53,485
The goddess of evil sendings!

475
00:53:54,485 --> 00:53:57,005
Just what happened?
Try to remember, Helen!

476
00:53:57,085 --> 00:54:00,605
I don't want to remember. Besides,
I don't see it's any affair of yours.

477
00:54:00,685 --> 00:54:02,645
Oh, but it is.

478
00:54:02,725 --> 00:54:04,925
We know that you were with Ardath Bey.

479
00:54:08,285 --> 00:54:11,565
Oh, Helen. Helen, I love you.

480
00:54:11,645 --> 00:54:14,365
I'm trying to help you
and protect you. We all are.

481
00:54:14,445 --> 00:54:18,285
Don't let me go again.
I'll try to get away, but you mustn't let me.

482
00:54:19,325 --> 00:54:21,885
No matter what I do or what I say.

483
00:54:21,965 --> 00:54:23,965
There's death there for me.

484
00:54:24,045 --> 00:54:27,325
And life for something else
inside me that isn't me.

485
00:54:27,405 --> 00:54:30,485
But it's alive too, and fighting for life.

486
00:54:30,565 --> 00:54:32,645
Save me from it, Frank. Save me.

487
00:54:32,725 --> 00:54:35,085
Oh, everything's going to be all right.

488
00:54:35,165 --> 00:54:38,645
Now that you've asked for help,
I'll never leave you alone.

489
00:54:38,725 --> 00:54:42,845
I'll get Mrs Muller down here with you,
and I'll stay here till the doctor comes.

490
00:54:42,925 --> 00:54:44,925
Then, we'll take you to my house.

491
00:54:45,765 --> 00:54:48,885
Oh, Helen. It's been such torture.

492
00:54:49,525 --> 00:54:51,525
I love you so.

493
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:58,045
I don't like that doctor. Please go in there
and find out what he's saying about me.

494
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:02,125
I will, my dear. He'll know just
what's the matter with you and cure you.

495
00:55:02,205 --> 00:55:04,205
Now, don't worry.

496
00:55:09,165 --> 00:55:12,205
Now, Miss Farthing, help me
to get dressed and get out of here.

497
00:55:12,285 --> 00:55:17,045
- Come over you again, Miss Grosvenor?
- I must escape. I'm being held. Help me.

498
00:55:17,125 --> 00:55:19,725
You told me, when
these fits came on I wasn't to listen.

499
00:55:19,805 --> 00:55:22,725
I have a friend. He's rich.
He'll give you money.

500
00:55:22,805 --> 00:55:25,605
Now you just lie down again.
You know you mustn't get up.

501
00:55:25,685 --> 00:55:27,845
If you don't want money,
what do you want most?

502
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:31,485
He'll give you anything,
if only you'll help me to go to him.

503
00:55:31,565 --> 00:55:34,045
Do you want me to call Dr Muller?

504
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:37,445
- No. I hate him.
- Mr Whemple, then?

505
00:55:39,725 --> 00:55:41,645
I'll die if I don't get away from him!

506
00:55:41,725 --> 00:55:43,845
- Now, Miss Grosvenor.
- It's killing me!

507
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:46,125
Now, Helen, you must not do this again.

508
00:55:46,205 --> 00:55:48,645
You're always so exhausted afterwards.

509
00:55:49,445 --> 00:55:50,525
(sobs)

510
00:55:50,845 --> 00:55:53,285
She's too weak to be removed
except to a hospital.

511
00:55:53,365 --> 00:55:56,285
I insist on keeping her here
under our direct observation.

512
00:55:56,365 --> 00:55:59,725
But, Doctor, you haven't told us what
to do. She gets weaker every day.

513
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:03,405
You know that negligee I bought in Paris?
Help me to put it on.

514
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:06,925
And bring me my toilet things.
I want some colour. I want to look well.

515
00:56:07,005 --> 00:56:09,165
You can't, my dear. They'd never allow it.

516
00:56:09,245 --> 00:56:12,045
- The nurse would be sure...
- I know. We'll get rid of her.

517
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:15,805
This is a plot, just between us.
I want to look the way I did.

518
00:56:15,885 --> 00:56:17,765
Just a surprise, for Frank.

519
00:56:17,845 --> 00:56:20,725
And I want you to bring him to me.
You understand?

520
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:24,485
In short, I have failed to make a diagnosis.

521
00:56:24,565 --> 00:56:27,445
Medical science is helpless
in a case like this.

522
00:56:28,045 --> 00:56:30,045
Frank.

523
00:56:30,965 --> 00:56:34,485
Go to her, and don't be angry with me.
I couldn't resist her.

524
00:56:38,765 --> 00:56:41,925
Helen, you shouldn't have done this.
They shouldn't have let you.

525
00:56:42,005 --> 00:56:44,885
Just this once. Perhaps the last time.

526
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:48,805
But you're going to get well.
Then I know I can make you love me.

527
00:56:48,885 --> 00:56:50,885
I know I can make you happy.

528
00:56:54,845 --> 00:56:58,365
I do love you, Frank.
And I'm trying to prove it,

529
00:56:58,445 --> 00:57:00,965
because I'd rather die
than live and lose you.

530
00:57:01,485 --> 00:57:04,605
But you're going to live.
We're not going to lose each other.

531
00:57:06,165 --> 00:57:08,245
- So, my dear. You...
- Don't scold me.

532
00:57:08,325 --> 00:57:12,045
Just feminine vanity.
I wanted to look my best again.

533
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:14,445
So you know more
than I realised you knew.

534
00:57:14,525 --> 00:57:18,725
- What do you mean?
- These impulses to go to him.

535
00:57:18,805 --> 00:57:21,605
The pull is too strong
to withstand and live.

536
00:57:21,685 --> 00:57:23,685
I am so glad you understand.

537
00:57:24,965 --> 00:57:27,805
Helen knows. She knows
the moment she stops struggling,

538
00:57:27,885 --> 00:57:30,245
he will give her back
her strength to come to him.

539
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:34,885
But I don't want to lose my own mind
and be someone else. Someone I hate.

540
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:40,645
My dear, while you were growing worse,
we tried to find him and failed.

541
00:57:40,725 --> 00:57:43,605
The next time the call comes, go to him.

542
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:50,605
Muller, what can we do now?

543
00:57:50,685 --> 00:57:54,045
We can do no more.
Ardath has beaten me.

544
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:56,925
The next time he draws her to him,
we must follow her.

545
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:59,885
- And then?
- We will destroy him.

546
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:16,725
(door opens)

547
00:58:24,645 --> 00:58:28,165
I've given her some bromide.
She's asleep now. I'll go to bed.

548
00:58:28,245 --> 00:58:31,125
- All right. I'll wait till Dr Muller comes.
- Good night.

549
00:58:31,205 --> 00:58:33,205
Good night.

550
00:59:14,245 --> 00:59:16,245
(chants in ancient Egyptian)

551
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:28,365
Where are we?

552
01:00:28,445 --> 01:00:32,525
This is my bed, but this is not the temple,
nor my father's palace.

553
01:00:32,605 --> 01:00:35,085
Do not look, Anck-es-en-Amon.

554
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:37,165
Do not be afraid.

555
01:00:37,765 --> 01:00:44,645
I was afraid. When you knelt beside my
bed, a veil came over my eyes. Darkness.

556
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:47,965
Your last memory is of me
in the hour of your death

557
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:52,605
as I knelt by your bed, 3700 years ago.

558
01:00:52,685 --> 01:00:57,285
No man has ever suffered
for woman as you suffered for me.

559
01:00:57,885 --> 01:01:01,165
- Now that the gods have forgiven us...
- No, no, not yet.

560
01:01:02,205 --> 01:01:04,205
Your soul is in a mortal body,

561
01:01:05,405 --> 01:01:08,685
renewed many times
since we loved in Thebes of old.

562
01:01:10,005 --> 01:01:14,325
But that love is not for us again
until the great change.

563
01:01:14,405 --> 01:01:16,405
I do not understand.

564
01:01:22,405 --> 01:01:24,405
Look.

565
01:01:34,205 --> 01:01:38,245
- Look and wonder.
- A figure of myself.

566
01:01:38,565 --> 01:01:41,565
It is my coffin,
made by my father against my death.

567
01:01:43,365 --> 01:01:45,805
What mummy has usurped
my eternal resting place?

568
01:01:45,885 --> 01:01:49,885
It is thy dead shell.
I tried then to raise this body.

569
01:01:49,965 --> 01:01:54,525
I could raise it now, but it would be
a mere thing that moved at my will,

570
01:01:54,605 --> 01:01:56,605
without a soul.

571
01:02:32,445 --> 01:02:35,805
It was not only this body
that I loved, it was thy soul.

572
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,725
I destroy this lifeless thing.

573
01:02:38,805 --> 01:02:41,805
Thou shalt take its place
but for a few moments,

574
01:02:41,885 --> 01:02:46,085
and then rise again,
even as I have risen.

575
01:03:03,645 --> 01:03:05,645
Come.

576
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:31,445
Imhotep, this is the place of embalming.

577
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:37,125
It is not lawful for me, a priestess of Isis,
to see or touch an unclean thing.

578
01:03:38,085 --> 01:03:41,285
Come to the altar of Anubis,
the guide of the dead.

579
01:03:52,045 --> 01:03:54,405
The time has come for the final prayer.

580
01:03:55,085 --> 01:03:57,085
What have I to do with Anubis?

581
01:04:01,645 --> 01:04:04,685
The ancient rites
must be performed over thy body.

582
01:04:04,885 --> 01:04:07,005
Then I will read
the great spell with which

583
01:04:07,085 --> 01:04:10,525
Isis brought Osiris back from the grave.

584
01:04:10,605 --> 01:04:12,805
And thou shalt rise again.

585
01:04:13,285 --> 01:04:15,205
No.

586
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:18,165
No, I'm alive! I'm young!

587
01:04:18,245 --> 01:04:20,325
I won't die!

588
01:04:20,405 --> 01:04:23,445
I loved you once,
but now you belong with the dead.

589
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:26,685
I am Anck-es-en-Amon, but I...

590
01:04:28,245 --> 01:04:30,445
I'm somebody else too.

591
01:04:30,525 --> 01:04:33,125
I want to live,
even in a strange new world.

592
01:04:33,205 --> 01:04:36,205
For thy sake I was buried alive.

593
01:04:36,285 --> 01:04:41,845
I ask of thee only a moment of agony.
Only so can we be united.

594
01:04:46,445 --> 01:04:48,445
The bath of natron.

595
01:04:49,245 --> 01:04:52,045
You shall not plunge my body into that.

596
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:54,165
Let the deed be done.

597
01:05:06,525 --> 01:05:08,725
(screams)

598
01:05:10,765 --> 01:05:13,285
Let me go. Let me go!

599
01:05:13,365 --> 01:05:16,325
Don't kill me! I'm a priestess of Isis.

600
01:05:16,405 --> 01:05:18,965
Save me from that mummy! It's dead!

601
01:05:19,645 --> 01:05:21,645
Save me!

602
01:05:44,605 --> 01:05:48,205
I no longer fear you.
Do with me what you will.

603
01:06:04,245 --> 01:06:06,205
Frank.

604
01:06:06,285 --> 01:06:08,525
Frank!

605
01:06:08,605 --> 01:06:11,405
She has gone to him.
They must be in the museum.

606
01:06:12,805 --> 01:06:14,885
Now I know his horrible plan.

607
01:06:15,845 --> 01:06:19,605
He is going to kill her, and
make her a living mummy like himself.

608
01:06:32,045 --> 01:06:36,645
The gods will receive into the underworld
the spirit of Anck-es-en-Amon.

609
01:06:37,605 --> 01:06:39,605
But not for long.

610
01:06:40,485 --> 01:06:43,925
Osiris will release thy soul.

611
01:06:56,805 --> 01:07:02,165
You shall rest from life,
like the setting sun in the west.

612
01:07:02,245 --> 01:07:04,365
But you shall dawn anew in the east,

613
01:07:04,445 --> 01:07:08,525
as the first rays of Amon-Ra
dispel the shadow.

614
01:07:20,085 --> 01:07:22,085
Look! What's that?

615
01:07:25,365 --> 01:07:27,005
Come on.

O Isis, holy maiden.
I was thy consecrated vestal.

I broke my vows. Save me now!

Teach me the ancient summons,
the holy spells I've forgotten.

I call upon thee as of old!
