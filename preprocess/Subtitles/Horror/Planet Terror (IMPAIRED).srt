MAN: As you may know,
illegal aliens such as yourself

10

are being forced out of our country
at an alarming rate

11
00:01:00,705 --> 00:01:03,268
for the good of both our people.

12
00:01:03,268 --> 00:01:06,008
Our new senator must die.

13
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:09,245

17
00:01:18,394 --> 00:01:20,123
because I'm the best there is.

18
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,194
Aah!

22
00:01:35,743 --> 00:01:38,747
And now you want me
to help you kill all these men?

23
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:40,407
Yes, bro.

24
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:43,384
I mean, Padre.

25
00:01:43,384 --> 00:01:45,887

No!

34
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,703
Oh, shit.

35
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:14,147
You mean that a Mexican day laborer

36
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:17,118
is a goddamn Federale?!

NARRATOR:
But they soon realized...

38
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,784

hire Machete to kill the bad guy,

Smokin' hot. Whew!

Cherry, darlin',
I told you too many fuckin' times--

62
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:03,605
you can't be up there cryin'
and all that shit.

63
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:05,402
You know what a go-go dance is?

64
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,072
Useless talent number 12?

65
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:10,135
No, it's a happy dance.

66
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:12,146
You get up there
and you dance happy.

67
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:14,444
It's go-go, not cry-cry.

68
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:16,442
I'm quitting.

69
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:18,316
You say that
at least one night a week.

70
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:20,855
I mean it this time.

71
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:25,326
I need a dramatic change in my life.

72
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:26,759
I've always said you're funny.

73
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,855
Like that Chris Rock...
only prettier.

74
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:31,524
But if you don't stop
all that cryin' and shit,

75
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:32,898
I'm gonna have to fire
your fuckin' ass,

You guys know the drill, huh?

94

Wait here, Lieutenant.

95
00:09:09,098 --> 00:09:10,656
I'll handle this.

96
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:15,530
Hey, Abby.

97
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:20,967
I can see you've had
a spot of trouble, Romey.

98
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:24,708
Would you like to tell me
what happened?

99
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,748
Well, they-- they escaped.

100
00:09:26,748 --> 00:09:27,874
Uh...

101
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:30,384
All three?

102
00:09:30,384 --> 00:09:31,920
Yeah, I--

103
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,386
I don't know, uh--

104
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:35,185
I don't know how they did it.
Just, they got out--

105
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:37,953
I'm sorry, Romey,
but I just don't trust you anymore.

106
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:40,885
And you know the rules.

107

Hold on.

108
00:09:41,987 --> 00:09:44,862

I swear, Abby, I'm-- I'm--

109
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:46,333
You're not gonna
see me anymore, okay?

110
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,801
ABBY: Not so fast.

111
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:56,340
I also want your balls.

112
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:06,614
I'm really quite attached to them.

113

ABBY: Oh, sweetheart.

114
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:11,016
I was really attached to my specimens.

115
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:14,688
Now they're out there in the night
doing God knows what.

116
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:17,255
I can't do it, Abby. Please.
Please, Abby.

117
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:22,197
Hey. Hey! What are you guys--

118

Let me go, you motherfuckers!

Son of a bitch!
Abby! Listen!

120
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,670
You don't need Abby!

121
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,710
There's more!

122
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,575
There's more!
I can get you all you want! Abby!

The shit's right there.

135
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:32,200
The deal is still good.

136
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,906
No, it's not.

137
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:39,003
You held out on me.

138

Looks like I got you
by the balls, Abby.

144
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:11,574
You certainly have.

145
00:12:11,574 --> 00:12:12,671
MULDOON: So...

146
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,015
I'll ask you one more time.

147
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,919
Where's...

148
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,152
the...

149
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:24,785
shit?

150
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,454
Everywhere.

151
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:34,233
(all screaming)

152
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,834
Oh, balls.

(tires screeching)

154
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:55,306
Get that thing away from my pumps!

155
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:57,011
It's just overheating.

156
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,116
I need to get to town.

157
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:06,390
It's just a stripped radiator cap.

158
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,861
Water leaks when it heats up.

159
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:13,700
No pressure.

160
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,102
You okay?

161
00:14:19,102 --> 00:14:21,574
I'm just cherry.

162
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:23,804
Go on and have a seat anywhere.
I'll be right in.

Here, take this with you.

That's your good spring water.

165
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:33,413
Ain't nothin' good about it.
I bottled it myself.

166
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:35,218
I get it right there out of the dam.

167
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:38,192
Thanks...

00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:43,721
The best barbecue in Texas
around the clock.

171
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:45,061
I gotta go.

172
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:47,227
Savin' lives, are you?

173
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:50,569
Now, how did you know that?

174
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:53,933
(starts engine)

175
00:14:58,947 --> 00:15:00,778
Now, that's a rump roast.

176
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:03,578
Mmm.

177
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,482
(buzz)

178
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,188
(groaning)

179
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:21,459
Open the shades.

180
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,628
Get some light in here.

181
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:32,077
Nice night.

182
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,846
Coffee.

183
00:15:38,587 --> 00:15:39,918
Oh, shit.

184
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,515
I couldn't get off work this week.

185
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:47,190
But you only have to stay till 10:00.

186
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:52,093
(whispering) A friend of mine will be here before
10:00 to pick up Tony.

187
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:55,102
TONY: I'm going to eat your brains
and gain your knowledge.

188
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:57,434
What did I tell you?
No playing with toys at the table.

189
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:59,303
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Yeah.

190
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,376
There's a packed suitcase
under his bed.

191
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:09,913
Give it to Tony to take with him
when my friend picks him up.

192
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,248
I'll leave him watching TV.

193
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,058
But you need to be here
in the next 20 minutes.

194
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:23,489
Thank you.

195
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,766
Hey, what happened to your tooth?

196
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:32,500
Fell out.

197
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Wow.

198
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:36,570
Think you can say a prayer
for your old man?

199
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:40,672
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.

200
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:43,513
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.
Amen.

201
00:16:43,513 --> 00:16:44,813
Amen.

202
00:16:48,557 --> 00:16:49,922
Who was that you were talking to?

203
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,357
Babysitter.

204
00:16:52,694 --> 00:16:54,127
She's on her way.

205
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:01,162
- You believe her?
- No.

206
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:03,164
Me, neither.

207
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:17,574
(inhales sharply)

208
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:20,146
(grunts)

209
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:26,286
Fucking catastrophe.

210
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,456
- Hey.
- Hey.

211
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:01,185
- How's it goin', J.T.?
- All right.

212
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,564
- Still open, I see.
- Oh, yeah, all night.

213
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,192
Cup of coffee
and a pack of cigarettes, please.

214
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,703
(dog whines)

215
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:12,034
Free of charge.

216
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:13,506
Tonight...

217
00:18:13,506 --> 00:18:15,167
is a special night.

218
00:18:16,211 --> 00:18:18,873
What's so special about tonight?

219
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:20,778
Been open 25 years.

220
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,458
You should've thrown a party.

221
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,289
I did. See the balloons?

222
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:36,229
You're the second person
to show up tonight.

223
00:18:36,229 --> 00:18:38,459
Who's the first?

224
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:39,795
Right there.

225
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:47,401
Must be passin' through.

226
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,171
Seems only strangers eat here.

227
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:52,970
I still eat here, J.T.

228
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,709
Oh, yeah, you sure do.

229
00:18:54,709 --> 00:18:57,183
By the way, don't choke
on all that food you're eatin'.

230
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:08,187
Hello, Palomita.

231
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,400
I don't go by that name anymore.

232
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,931
Why not?

233
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:20,073
because it's the name you gave me.

234
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,611
So, uh...

235
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:28,673
you ever become that--
that fancy doctor?

236
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,280
Never did.

237
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,587
I thought for sure you would.

238
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,621
Talked about it enough.

239
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:40,923
That's the problem with goals--

240
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:44,056
they become the thing you talk about
instead of the thing you do.

241
00:19:44,056 --> 00:19:46,225
That's my jacket.

242
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:49,700
I looked for it for two weeks.

243
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,363
Yeah? How long did you
look for me, Wray?

244
00:19:51,363 --> 00:19:53,203
Yeah, well, the jacket belonged to me.
You didn't.

245
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:56,408
So, um...

246
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:58,912
what are you doing now?

247
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,577
I'm going to be a standup comedian.

248
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,746
Really?

249
00:20:09,825 --> 00:20:11,554
You're not funny.

250
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:15,119
That's what I've been trying
to tell everybody,

251
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,495
but they all say I'm hysterical.

252
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,259
But you're not.

253
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:21,802
Great. Well, that's just fantastic,

254
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:24,805
because I believed everybody,
and I've already booked shows in town.

255
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:26,204
Now what am I gonna do?

256
00:20:26,204 --> 00:20:29,471
Yeah. Yeah, that--
that sucks, really.

257
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:33,670
There's a difference
between being frank

258
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,149
and being dick.

259
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:38,482
Yeah, well...

260
00:20:38,482 --> 00:20:40,521
it was really good seeing you again.

261
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:43,350
Oh. Um...

262
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,359
what name do you go by now...

263
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,258
in case I want to catch
one of your shows?

264
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:48,887
Cherry.

265
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,724
Cherry Darling.

266
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:55,427
Sounds like a stripper.

267
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:57,904
No, it sounds like a go-go dancer.

268
00:20:57,904 --> 00:20:59,372
There's a difference.

269
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:00,840
Right.

270
00:21:01,943 --> 00:21:03,001
Well...

271
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:06,073
you'll always be Palomita to me.

272
00:21:19,428 --> 00:21:21,453
I need a ride.

273
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:24,595
(dog whines)

274
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,028
What do you say, El Wray?

275
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:32,366
I'll give you a ride.

276
00:21:40,515 --> 00:21:41,880
Good-bye, Bill.

277
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,214
- Don't you mean "see you later"?
- Of course.

278
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:49,052
Hey. What's up, Doc?

279
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:52,226
The little lady's lookin'
pretty good there, I gotta say.

280
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:54,922
Looks like she could suck
the bend out of a river.

281
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:56,088
I'm kiddin'. Heh.

282
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,824
- Take a look at that shit.
- BILL: What happened to your arm?

283
00:21:59,824 --> 00:22:02,165
Well, uh... I got bit.

284
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:04,535
Bit? Bit by what?

285
00:22:04,535 --> 00:22:06,938
Well, if I told you,
you probably wouldn't believe me.

286
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,900
I need some Bactine or something?

287
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,103
Whew.

288
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:15,441
Can't you just... sew it up?

289
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:17,212
Well, normally I would.

290
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:20,083
I'd even be doing something
to stop the bleeding.

291
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:22,316
The only problem is
this one doesn't bleed.

292
00:22:22,316 --> 00:22:24,187
DR. FELIX:
Oh, shit. Check this out.

293
00:22:24,187 --> 00:22:26,420
When this was still a military hospital,

294
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,520
this one guy came back
from Iraq with this.

295
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,621
Whew!

296
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:31,859
Chronic herpetic lesions.

297
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:34,493
When he urinated, it came out
through all these little holes here,

298
00:22:34,493 --> 00:22:35,729
kind of like a fountain.

299
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,294
Oh, Jesus.

300
00:22:37,294 --> 00:22:38,896
Well, how'd you treat it?

301
00:22:40,408 --> 00:22:43,104
Fuck that. I was never in Iraq.

302
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:45,305
Good for you. The shit they spread
around there you wouldn't believe.

303
00:22:45,305 --> 00:22:47,280
I swear to God.
I've got these Iraqi eyeballs

304
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,317
a friend of mine brought back
to do some studies on.

305
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:51,511
Incredible. They were
completely milked over.

306
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:53,110
Mustard gas--
it does that to your eyes.

307
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,587
Actually, I still have those in my fridge.

308
00:22:55,724 --> 00:22:57,487
Bot fly, do you think?

309
00:22:57,487 --> 00:23:00,892
DR. FELIX:
Chronic viral ulcerative lesion.

310
00:23:00,892 --> 00:23:02,623
That looks like gout.

311
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,562
He's running a temperature of 105.

312
00:23:06,562 --> 00:23:08,262
- Is that bad?
- It's high.

313
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,633
Bad will be 108.

314
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:13,299
You could have a seizure,
go psychotic.

315
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:15,605
And-- and probably die.

316
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:17,569
Say "ahh."

317
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:20,080
- Ahh.
- Oh! Jesus!

318
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,979
Oh, nice.

319
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:23,415
Black abscessed tongue.

320
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:25,976
All abscesses
should be drained, period.

321
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,357
(squishing)

322
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:34,019
(muffled) What are you doing?

323
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:36,288
Shut up, Joe.

324
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,664
(beep)

325
00:23:47,664 --> 00:23:50,370
Baby... get the needles.

326
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:53,842
Be right there.

327
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:57,181
<i>BILL: (over speaker)
Right now.</i>

328
00:23:57,181 --> 00:23:58,116
Asshole.

329
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,331
It's spreading.

330
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:16,463
Holy shit.

331
00:24:16,463 --> 00:24:18,665
- When did you say you got this bite?
- Just now.

332
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,207
See this?

333
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:23,676
This shows the advanced stages
of gangrene and epidermal rot.

334
00:24:23,676 --> 00:24:25,406
- And this over here...
- Advanced rot?

335
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:29,075
...shows the swelling of tissues
and the lack of any type of circulation.

336
00:24:29,075 --> 00:24:31,618
See, you're telling me
that you just got this bite?

337
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:34,154
- Yeah, just like a half hour ago.
- What I'm seeing here

338
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:36,520
is a deep impact wound
with several virals

339
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,252
and secondary bacterials,

340
00:24:38,252 --> 00:24:41,386
and that, by the accumulation of
denuded tissue around the incision marks,

341
00:24:41,386 --> 00:24:45,832
indicates that you've had this bite
for over 14 days.

342
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:47,561
DR. FELIX:
Uh... uh, at least 14 days.

343
00:24:47,561 --> 00:24:48,864
Could that be possible?

344
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:51,497
14 days? No way. I mean--

345
00:24:51,497 --> 00:24:53,734
Well... what is today?

346
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,040
Today's Wednesday.

347
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,238
The 15th.

348
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:00,805
Of April.

349
00:25:00,805 --> 00:25:03,476
Aw, hell. Can't I just get
a tetanus shot or something?

350
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:06,549
We gotta lose the arm, Joe.

351
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:08,350
Lose the arm?
What do you mean, lose the arm? My arm?

352
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,947
It's spreading all the way
up to your shoulder.

353
00:25:09,947 --> 00:25:12,755
Now, if we don't sever that arm now,
it's gonna take over your chest,

354
00:25:12,755 --> 00:25:14,920
and we can't very well
cut that off, can we?

355
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,520
Well, shouldn't I get a second opinion?

356
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:18,494
Hi, Joe.

357
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,792
I'm going to give you
a very strong anesthetic,

358
00:25:22,792 --> 00:25:25,135
so you won't feel anything
during the procedure.

359
00:25:25,135 --> 00:25:26,298
These...

360
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:28,607
(whispers)
...are my friends.

361
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:29,803
My yellow friend...

362
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:34,113
- ...is just to take the sting off.
- Aah!

363
00:25:34,849 --> 00:25:37,113
My blue friend...

364
00:25:37,113 --> 00:25:38,675
you'll barely feel.

365
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:42,883
That means my yellow friend
is already taking effect.

366
00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:44,447
See how fast my friends work?

367
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:49,428
(distorted voice)
And after my red-headed friend...

368
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:51,590
(whispers)
...you'll never see me again.

369
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,657
(echoing)
...see me again, see me again.

370
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:01,773
They all react differently.

371
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:04,940
(engine won't start)

372
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,172
Now what?

373
00:26:08,172 --> 00:26:10,240
<i>RADIO DJ:
Dedicated to our own Jungle Julia--</i>

374
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,910
<i>in loving memory.</i>

375
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:15,955
(beeps)

376
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,361
It's not the radiator.

377
00:26:28,002 --> 00:26:29,196
Damn it.

378
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:32,032
(sighs)

379
00:26:40,982 --> 00:26:42,074
(gasps)

380
00:26:42,074 --> 00:26:44,277
(distant groaning)

381
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:50,083
All right.

382
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,523
Fuckin' thing.

383
00:26:51,523 --> 00:26:53,356
Cheap-- whoa.

384
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:56,723
Damn light.

385
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,692
Ohh.

386
00:26:58,692 --> 00:27:00,826
(car approaching)

387
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:09,807
Hey. Hey!

388
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:11,709
Hey! Bastard!

389
00:27:11,709 --> 00:27:13,179
Bastard!

390
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:18,082
(breathing heavily)

391
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,249
(muttering)

392
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,248
Oh, thank God.

393
00:27:24,248 --> 00:27:25,383
Oh.

394
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:27,287
Oh. Hey!

395
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:28,852
- (horn honks)
- Hey! Hey!

396
00:27:28,852 --> 00:27:30,056
(tires screech)

397
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:32,156
MAN: Get outta
the fuckin' road, bitch!

398
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:36,630
(groaning)

399
00:27:44,145 --> 00:27:46,545
Ohh! Stop!

400
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:47,740
Stop!

401
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,613
Please! Stop!

402
00:27:49,613 --> 00:27:52,278
(snarling)

403
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:55,015
WOMAN: No! No!

404
00:27:55,015 --> 00:27:57,250
(chomping and snarling)

405
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:12,168
What the hell was that?

406
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,467
People picking up road kill.

407
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:18,102
What, like an armadillo?

408
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:20,344
Deer.

409
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:22,946
You get a lot of them around here.

410
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:26,517
You know, I read a statistic that said...

411
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:32,083
that the eating of venison has risen
30% in the last few years.

412
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:34,390
60% of that's from road kill.

413
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,398
People eat road kill?

414
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:39,433
If you're driving out here
at 70 miles an hour

415
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:41,229
and a deer darts out
in front of you,

416
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:44,430
if you blink or brake or swerve--

417
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,234
shit, you'll just kill yourself.

418
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:47,797
So, what do you do?

419
00:28:47,797 --> 00:28:49,468
Just pick them off...

420
00:28:49,468 --> 00:28:51,011
just like this.

421
00:28:51,011 --> 00:28:52,569
Send it flying away from you.

422
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:54,137
Unacceptable.

423
00:28:54,137 --> 00:28:55,739
Not really.

424
00:28:57,151 --> 00:28:59,745
It's just a clear case of you or him.

425
00:28:59,745 --> 00:29:00,585
Or her.

426
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:03,921
Oh, fuck!

427
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,489
CHERRY: Aah! Aah!

428
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,866
Cherry?

429
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:27,211
I thought you said if you saw a deer,
you shouldn't fucking swerve!

430
00:29:27,211 --> 00:29:28,681
It wasn't a deer.

431
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:30,513
(screaming)

432
00:29:30,513 --> 00:29:33,782
Cherry! Cherry! No!

433
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:52,163
(snarling)

434
00:29:52,163 --> 00:29:53,400
CHERRY: Aah!

435
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:02,980
(snarling)

436
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,414
Palomita.

437
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,618
- Don't let her die on me, Block.
- What do we got?

438
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:16,061
Car accident. Heavy contusions
about the torso,

439
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:17,825
possible spinal trauma...

440
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:20,491
one severed limb.

441
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:23,330
Where's the leg?

442
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,235
Three sickos attacked her.

443
00:30:25,235 --> 00:30:27,103
I shot at them.

444
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:30,338
I never miss.

445
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,007
They took the leg with them.

446
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:50,222
You'll have to come with us, Wray.
We need to talk about this, you know?

447
00:30:50,222 --> 00:30:51,663
He has to sign her in.

448
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:52,893
Do what, now?

449
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,867
Well, he's with her.
He's responsible for her.

450
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:57,905
He can fill this out after we talk.
Let's go.

451
00:31:00,174 --> 00:31:01,368
Okay.

452
00:31:01,368 --> 00:31:02,773
Okay! Fuck!

453
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:05,201
Hey, Block.

454
00:31:10,718 --> 00:31:12,583
No, you do it.

455
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:16,550
Suit yourself.

456
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,613
(saw buzzes)

457
00:31:17,613 --> 00:31:19,455
What are you doing
with a rifle, Wray?

458
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:21,988
Nothing.

459
00:31:21,988 --> 00:31:24,725
Just thinking about maybe doing
some hunting when the season breaks.

460
00:31:24,725 --> 00:31:26,289
Come on, Wray.

461
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:28,892
You know you're not supposed
to be doing that stuff anymore.

462
00:31:28,892 --> 00:31:30,904
Not even hunting?

463
00:31:30,904 --> 00:31:33,338
Not even hunting.
And you know that.

464
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:35,000
Not with your history.

465
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,204
And here I stick my neck out for you.

466
00:31:38,204 --> 00:31:40,509
I stick it out far.

467
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:43,311
Now you've got a gal in your wrecked truck
with a missing leg?

468
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:46,279
A missing leg that's now missing?

469
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,447
And here you're saying
in front of everybody

470
00:31:48,447 --> 00:31:50,354
that someone up and snatched it?

471
00:31:50,354 --> 00:31:51,824
And that you shot at them with a gun

472
00:31:51,824 --> 00:31:53,986
that you never should've had
in the first place?

473
00:31:53,986 --> 00:31:55,324
And that now they're gone?

474
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,264
What if I find the leg?

475
00:31:58,264 --> 00:32:00,596
So, now you know where it is?

476
00:32:00,596 --> 00:32:03,660
You'll tell us where it is,
give us a full confession, you're saying?

477
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,865
Sheriff, can we finish
this conversation somewhere else?

478
00:32:05,865 --> 00:32:07,100
My thought exactly.

479
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:14,706
I know it sounds a little arrogant
puttin' up a sign--

480
00:32:14,706 --> 00:32:17,273
"Best damn barbecue in Texas..."

481
00:32:17,273 --> 00:32:19,182
- (dog whines)
- "Period."

482
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:22,416
But, hell...

483
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:24,651
who's gonna come in here
and argue about that?

484
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:29,726
Oh, yeah.
Big contest comin' up.

485
00:32:30,598 --> 00:32:31,690
Mm.

486
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:35,331
I'm workin' on the perfect sauce.

487
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:37,397
Yeah.

488
00:32:38,306 --> 00:32:40,137
That'll put me on the Food Channel.

489
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,200
Put this place back on the map
where it belongs.

490
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,575
I'll talk to you later.

491
00:32:57,258 --> 00:33:00,523
Can I interest y'all in a plate of
soon-to-be-award-winnin' barbecue?

492
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:07,560
(chuckles)

493
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,432
You're from Dinky's, ain't ya?

494
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:11,700
Well, you tell that sumbitch,

495
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,366
he thinks he's gonna come over here
and get my recipes...

496
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:18,675
well, I got a double-barreled answer
to his query right inside.

497
00:33:21,983 --> 00:33:23,814
God damn, that's good.

498
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,680
Doctor Block!

499
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,591
Three fresh ones rollin' in!

500
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:34,787
Christ, you're kidding.

501
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:37,092
PARAMEDIC: Automobile accident
off of Highway 18.

502
00:33:37,092 --> 00:33:38,564
DOAs?

503
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:40,032
Have Andy pick them up.

504
00:33:40,032 --> 00:33:42,797
He's already on 620
picking up another two.

505
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,466
Fucking Wednesday nights.

506
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,142
That's unsanitary, Doc.

507
00:33:49,142 --> 00:33:51,144
Not if I'm the only one using it.

508
00:33:51,144 --> 00:33:53,510
Helps me monitor
my state of calmness.

509
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:56,049
Yeah, don't get all worked up
enough to crack it.

510
00:33:56,049 --> 00:33:57,106
Fuck.

511
00:33:57,106 --> 00:33:59,244
You might cut yourself pretty good.

512
00:33:59,244 --> 00:34:01,413
Then I'd know I was not calm.

513
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,294
Yeah, what do you say now, Doc?

514
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,757
Somebody call my wife.

515
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,950
WRAY: DC-2?

516
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,282
Mm.

517
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:38,983
Yeah.

518
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,395
Well, what about
countering with atropine?

519
00:34:46,367 --> 00:34:47,459
Yeah.

520
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:52,438
Okay. Gotcha, gotcha.

521
00:34:54,408 --> 00:34:56,933
Well, boys, I'm beat.

522
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:59,775
I gotta get home.
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

523
00:34:59,775 --> 00:35:02,179
All right, then.
Thanks for the extra help, Earl.

524
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:03,911
EARL: Hey, Wray.

525
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:05,612
You in trouble again?

526
00:35:05,612 --> 00:35:07,779
Just passin' through, I hope.

527
00:35:07,779 --> 00:35:08,981
EARL: Well, me, too.

528
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,216
WRAY: How's the wife, Earl?

529
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,691
Well, she's not too good.

530
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:15,854
Thanks for askin'.

531
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:19,491
Most of it's her own doin', you know.

532
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:21,660
Smokin' them goddamn cigarettes.

533
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,363
Pack a day for 40 years.

534
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:27,872
Yeah, she doesn't want anything
to do with, uh... chemo.

535
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:31,901
So... it does take its toll.

536
00:35:31,901 --> 00:35:34,072
You don't smoke, do you, Wray?

537
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:36,074
No.

538
00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:39,681
That's probably good.

539
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:43,120
See y'all.

540
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,293
SHERIFF HAGUE:
You're gonna start by telling me

541
00:35:47,293 --> 00:35:49,056
when you first started
carrying this gun.

542
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:52,394
And then we'll move up

543
00:35:52,394 --> 00:35:54,900
to when you first set eyes
on this gal Cherry.

544
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:19,686
(breathing heavily)

545
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,695
(grunting)

546
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:41,045
Okay.

547
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:43,044
Okay.

548
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:52,454
(telephone rings)

549
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,454
Sheriff Hague.

550
00:36:54,454 --> 00:36:56,325
<i>It's J.T., Sheriff.</i>

551
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:58,456
J.T., how's the barbecue business?

552
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:02,960
Ever since that bastard landlord
raised the rent, it's gone to shit.

553
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,096
Well, I'm real sorry
to hear about that.

554
00:37:05,096 --> 00:37:06,571
I wish there was something
I could do.

555
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:10,007
Right now I ain't callin' my brother.
I'm callin' the sheriff.

556
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:12,443
I'm listening. What's the trouble?

557
00:37:12,443 --> 00:37:14,811
<i>Well, there ain't no trouble.
Not yet, anyway.</i>

558
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:17,544
I got two delinquents been hangin'
around here for over an hour.

559
00:37:17,544 --> 00:37:19,745
They won't purchase
and they won't leave.

560
00:37:21,455 --> 00:37:23,184
Oh, never mind. Here they come.

561
00:37:23,184 --> 00:37:26,693
You cook that meat
at 250 degrees, don't you?

562
00:37:26,693 --> 00:37:29,457
I don't remember.
I set the heat with my hand.

563
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:32,363
You give me that recipe, or I'll raise
your rent higher than a Georgia pine.

564
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:34,901
<i>Brother, ain't no Texan's ever gonna
give you his barbecue recipe.</i>

565
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:37,130
That's a fact.
He'll take it to his grave.

566
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,638
<i>I could be bleedin' like a stuck pig,
I ain't gonna tell you.</i>

567
00:37:39,638 --> 00:37:42,335
<i>I could be dyin' in your arms,
I ain't gonna tell you!</i>

568
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:44,139
- Heh heh heh.
- We'll see about that.

569
00:37:48,315 --> 00:37:49,373
You gonna look...

570
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,485
or you gonna eat?

571
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:02,459
You called for me?

572
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:04,361
I need for you to see this.

573
00:38:06,734 --> 00:38:08,258
PARAMEDIC: Looks like a no-brainer.

574
00:38:08,258 --> 00:38:09,734
BILL: What does that mean?

575
00:38:09,734 --> 00:38:11,396
SECOND PARAMEDIC:
No brain.

576
00:38:11,396 --> 00:38:14,168
Scooped clean out of her skull.

577
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:15,970
DR. FELIX: Oh, oh, oh!
I know what this is.

578
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,568
Don't tell me.
Uh... liquefactive necrosis.

579
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,974
PARAMEDIC: You think?

580
00:38:20,974 --> 00:38:22,208
DR. FELIX:
Oh, sure, yeah.

581
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,875
Thank you. That'll be all.

582
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,724
Oh...

583
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:40,026
Did you know she was back in town?

584
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:43,129
No.

585
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:45,769
I didn't.

586
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:52,874
What happened to her?

587
00:38:54,315 --> 00:38:55,942
I don't know, baby.

588
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:03,347
I thought you stopped
seeing each other.

589
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:07,592
We have.

590
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,398
Well, yes, you have now--
she's fucking dead.

591
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:15,468
I mean, we--
we stopped before.

592
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:21,501
I--

593
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:23,770
I haven't talked to her in a while.

594
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,912
But you've written each other.

595
00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:35,984
Here and there.

596
00:39:35,984 --> 00:39:37,819
But not--

597
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:39,416
What are you doing?!

598
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:42,795
Let me see your last three messages.

599
00:39:44,698 --> 00:39:46,598
- You have no right.
- I don't?

600
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:50,633
I don't have a right?

601
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,264
Show it to me.

602
00:39:55,509 --> 00:39:57,101
Show it to me.

603
00:39:57,101 --> 00:39:58,337
No.

604
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,644
Aah!

605
00:40:00,644 --> 00:40:03,080
Now, that's just to take the sting off.

606
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:08,111
Show it to me.

607
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:10,179
(crying)
No, please.

608
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:13,124
- Show... it... to... me!
- Aaahh! Aah! Aah!

609
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,289
(drops syringe)

610
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,924
Now let's see how fast
your friends work.

611
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:30,041
(whimpering)

612
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:32,610
That's pretty fast.

613
00:40:34,548 --> 00:40:35,742
(beep)

614
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:39,451
Oh, what do I know, my love?

615
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:41,181
Exactly.

616
00:40:41,181 --> 00:40:44,986
That you're a cheating, lying...

617
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:48,992
sack.

618
00:40:48,992 --> 00:40:51,293
I didn't want to hurt you.

619
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:53,925
BILL: (whispers)
But you did.

620
00:40:53,925 --> 00:40:55,366
Bill...

621
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:57,495
you're insane.

622
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:02,268
And I was afraid...

623
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,641
of what you might do to me,

624
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:07,544
to our son.

625
00:41:08,582 --> 00:41:10,880
I'm the mother of your son.

626
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:12,407
Aah!

627
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:18,224
And after this one...

628
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,821
I'll never see you again.

629
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,375
PARAMEDIC: Doc.

630
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:39,071
What?

631
00:41:39,071 --> 00:41:41,774
You gotta see this.

632
00:41:41,774 --> 00:41:43,441
I'll be right there.

633
00:41:54,628 --> 00:41:56,220
Where the hell are the bodies?

634
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,230
That's what we wanted to show you.

635
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,356
They're gone.

636
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:02,731
They didn't just get up
and walk out, did they?

637
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:04,361
# Mmm-hmm #

638
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,933
Shut the fuck up!

639
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,680
Somebody take care of this perp for me
before I fucking kill him!

640
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,737
What the hell's going on?

641
00:42:15,737 --> 00:42:18,478
Ah, he was causin' a ruckus
over at Skip's place, so I cuffed him,

642
00:42:18,478 --> 00:42:22,249
and the son of a bitch
bit my goddamn finger off.

643
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:24,916
Quit your hollerin' and get yourself
a goddamn Band-Aid.

644
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:27,483
I'm not exaggerating,
using colorful speech, Sheriff.

645
00:42:27,483 --> 00:42:29,791
He bit my finger clean off!

646
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:31,660
Fucking shit!

647
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,427
Get out there and book him,

648
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:35,468
because I'll fuckin' kill him
if I have to do it.

649
00:42:35,468 --> 00:42:37,094
Carlos, go get him.

650
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:41,039
Wray, you stay put.

651
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:04,292
Are you sure he's in there?

652
00:43:05,132 --> 00:43:06,861
He was.

653
00:43:06,861 --> 00:43:08,424
Motherfucker.

654
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:41,029
(dramatic music)

655
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:43,230
He's gone.

656
00:43:44,138 --> 00:43:45,503
Broke out the window.

657
00:43:45,503 --> 00:43:47,540
Where's my finger?

658
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,132
Found your ring.

659
00:43:49,132 --> 00:43:51,871
Could it be the same guy
as your leg-snatcher?

660
00:43:52,746 --> 00:43:54,839
WRAY: I didn't get
a good look at mine.

661
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:57,406
(snarling)

662
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:00,576
That him over there?

663
00:44:18,672 --> 00:44:21,835
(Carlos screaming)

664
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:29,680
(snarling)

665
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,569
Whoa! Whoa!

666
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:50,967
Aah!

667
00:44:53,807 --> 00:44:55,604
- Wray?
- (man screaming)

668
00:44:58,245 --> 00:44:59,473
(snarling)

669
00:45:07,554 --> 00:45:08,748
Fuck.

670
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:11,916
(grunts)

671
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,886
You motherfucker!

672
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:16,190
Uhh!

673
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:25,663
(growling)

674
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,601
(screaming)

675
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,785
(snarls)

676
00:45:46,526 --> 00:45:48,960
- No, don't touch him!
- Why not?

677
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,257
He's infected.

678
00:45:50,257 --> 00:45:51,729
With what?

679
00:45:51,729 --> 00:45:52,992
Everything.

680
00:45:52,992 --> 00:45:55,796
Wray!
Drop the fuckin' gun.

681
00:46:02,442 --> 00:46:04,467
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?!

682
00:46:04,467 --> 00:46:06,535
I'm gonna go get Cherry!

683
00:46:06,535 --> 00:46:09,309
Fine. But we're taking my car.

684
00:46:14,788 --> 00:46:16,255
I'm riding with you.

685
00:46:18,191 --> 00:46:20,250
Don't make any sudden moves.

686
00:46:33,073 --> 00:46:34,563
Viral infections.

687
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:37,807
They came pouring in.

688
00:46:37,807 --> 00:46:40,813
Some are rapidly developing
coliform lesions.

689
00:46:40,813 --> 00:46:42,906
Highly contagious.

690
00:46:42,906 --> 00:46:44,746
What do you think?

691
00:46:45,786 --> 00:46:48,346
Self-preservation comes to mind.

692
00:46:48,346 --> 00:46:50,913
Yeah. Let's get the hell out of here.

693
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:54,557
First let me get my wife.

694
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,934
(saw buzzing)

695
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,746
(grunting)

00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:23,714

00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:44,774
(grunting)

699
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:03,754
I love you, sweetie.

700
00:48:03,754 --> 00:48:05,354
There you go, bunny rabbit.

701
00:48:05,354 --> 00:48:06,956
Come on, come on.

702
00:48:06,956 --> 00:48:08,695
Open up, now.

703
00:48:08,695 --> 00:48:10,930
I want you to be around for a while,
you understand?

704
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,564
We don't want you checkin' out
right this--

705
00:48:13,564 --> 00:48:16,370
God... damn.

706
00:48:17,277 --> 00:48:18,369
Ramona.

707
00:48:19,546 --> 00:48:22,845
You been fartin' like a goddamn
pack mule since I met--

708
00:48:22,845 --> 00:48:23,905
God damn!

709
00:48:23,905 --> 00:48:25,611
<i>SHERIFF HAGUE:

Meet me at my brother's!

714
00:48:34,925 --> 00:48:36,462
I gotcha. I'll be there.

715
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,965
Gotta eat quick, sweetie.

00:48:39,965 --> 00:48:41,159
Come on.

Are you gonna give me a gun?

733
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:37,045
Are you fucking kidding me?

Yeah.

00:51:16,077 --> 00:51:18,623
Not today! Not today!

743
00:51:18,623 --> 00:51:20,990
- (snarling)
- Fucking Wednesday nights!

Uhh!

749
00:52:20,353 --> 00:52:21,684
Palomita?

Get up. We're leaving.

752
00:52:27,357 --> 00:52:28,860
I can't walk.

753
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,055
So what? Get up!

754
00:52:31,055 --> 00:52:32,223
- Get--
- Aah!

755
00:52:32,223 --> 00:52:33,391
Uhh!

756
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,259
Motherfucker.

757
00:52:36,259 --> 00:52:37,963
Look at me!

758
00:52:37,963 --> 00:52:39,232
Look at me!

759
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:43,007
I was gonna be a standup comedian.

760
00:52:43,007 --> 00:52:44,703
But who's gonna laugh now?

761
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,643
Some of their best jokes
are about cripples.

762
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:47,805
Let's go.

763
00:52:47,805 --> 00:52:49,508
(crying)
It's not funny. It's pathetic.

764
00:52:49,508 --> 00:52:51,049
Would you stop cryin' over fuckin'...

765
00:52:51,049 --> 00:52:52,277
spilled milk?

766
00:52:52,277 --> 00:52:54,513
I have no leg!

767
00:53:00,794 --> 00:53:01,522
(thud, squish)

768
00:53:01,522 --> 00:53:02,618
(grunts)

769
00:53:03,596 --> 00:53:05,962
Now you do.
What do you think?

770
00:53:10,537 --> 00:53:12,835
You could carry me, Wray.

771
00:53:12,835 --> 00:53:15,136
Yeah? You never wanted that before.

772
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:17,137
Why start now?

773
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,669
Ah-ah!

774
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:24,278
Uhh!

775
00:53:24,278 --> 00:53:25,278
Ahh!

776
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:27,577
Uhh!

777
00:53:30,256 --> 00:53:32,349
This is fucking ridiculous.

778
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,694
(snarling)

779
00:53:37,597 --> 00:53:39,588
The sheriff must've
taken the others to J.T.'s.

780
00:53:39,588 --> 00:53:40,758
Get in.

781
00:53:45,772 --> 00:53:47,137
(grunting)

782
00:53:47,137 --> 00:53:49,232
God damn it, wait for me.

783
00:54:00,053 --> 00:54:02,613
My leg's stuck in the door!

784
00:54:02,613 --> 00:54:04,623
- It's just wood.
- It's splintering.

785
00:54:04,623 --> 00:54:06,454
Will you just leave it alone?

786
00:54:06,454 --> 00:54:07,959
Why is this happening to me?

787
00:54:07,959 --> 00:54:10,928
I don't know. Just--
just do me a favor right now and just...

788
00:54:10,928 --> 00:54:12,794
stay strong.

789
00:54:14,134 --> 00:54:15,567
"Stay"?

790
00:54:16,636 --> 00:54:19,104
Yeah, baby. Stay.

791
00:54:20,907 --> 00:54:22,898
Okay, my name is Electra.

792
00:54:22,898 --> 00:54:24,170
Fucking listen.

793
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:25,871
My name is Electra.
Her name is Electra, too.

794
00:54:25,871 --> 00:54:28,345
(speaking Spanish)

795
00:54:28,345 --> 00:54:30,042
It's furry.

796
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:31,640
(speaking Spanish)

797
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,390
No.

798
00:54:33,086 --> 00:54:34,781
He's a furry one.

799
00:54:34,781 --> 00:54:37,288
She goes by Lia, I go by El.
El from "Electra", Ame from "Amelia".

800
00:54:37,288 --> 00:54:39,450
Does that make
any fucking sense in your head?

801
00:54:41,661 --> 00:54:44,129
You can call me whatever the fuck
you want-- I don't give a shit.

802
00:54:44,129 --> 00:54:46,757
(doorbell rings, knock on door)

803
00:54:52,839 --> 00:54:54,306
<i>Oye, chica.</i>

804
00:54:54,306 --> 00:54:56,069
- You said 10:00!
- I'm sorry.

805
00:54:56,069 --> 00:54:58,303
We can't be watching your kid
all goddamn night!

806
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,869
Your friend never showed up,
and we got shit to do!

807
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:02,471
That's right.

808
00:55:02,471 --> 00:55:04,517
Then start doing it.

809
00:55:06,019 --> 00:55:07,247
Oh!

810
00:55:08,288 --> 00:55:09,983
Uhh!

811
00:55:11,157 --> 00:55:13,557
Tony! We're leaving!

812
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:16,789
Wait, my tarantula.

813
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:18,728
Bring it. Let's go.

814
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:20,163
And my turtle.

815
00:55:20,934 --> 00:55:21,958
And my scorpion.

816
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:25,334
We're not all octopuses.
We can't carry everything.

817
00:55:25,334 --> 00:55:26,838
"Octopi."

818
00:55:26,838 --> 00:55:29,841
Ohh... come on, let's go.

819
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:37,576
Tony, what did I tell you?

820
00:55:37,576 --> 00:55:40,380
You can't bring them all.
Didn't I tell you that?

821
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,921
It's okay. They can live
in the same tank.

822
00:55:42,921 --> 00:55:45,549
What about my pocket bike?

823
00:55:45,549 --> 00:55:46,922
It's in the trunk.

824
00:55:46,922 --> 00:55:48,392
Aah!

825
00:55:48,392 --> 00:55:50,759
Where do you think you're going,
you fucking bitch?!

826
00:55:51,464 --> 00:55:51,930
(gasps)

827
00:55:53,466 --> 00:55:54,990
We're gonna fuckin' kill you!

828
00:56:00,406 --> 00:56:01,873
(shouts)

829
00:56:01,873 --> 00:56:04,205
(both shouting at once)

830
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:13,910
Are you sure you want to do this?

831
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,648
(clatters)

832
00:56:16,389 --> 00:56:18,050
SHERIFF HAGUE:
Everybody grab a badge and a gun.

833
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:21,525
You're all deputies
as of this moment forward.

834
00:56:21,525 --> 00:56:23,186
Except for you, Wray.

835
00:56:31,905 --> 00:56:33,031
Yo.

836
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,471
What do we got?

837
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:37,305
Something's wrong up there.

838
00:56:38,111 --> 00:56:40,511
J.T. always comes out and greets.

839
00:56:40,511 --> 00:56:41,672
Let's go.

840
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:45,884
Try not to shoot yourselves.

841
00:56:47,687 --> 00:56:48,881
Don't shoot each other.

842
00:56:50,123 --> 00:56:51,454
But especially...

843
00:56:54,027 --> 00:56:55,392
don't shoot me.

844
00:56:56,029 --> 00:56:57,223
(grunts)

845
00:57:02,569 --> 00:57:03,968
J.T.?

846
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:13,542
Go on! Get off him, Rusty!

847
00:57:13,542 --> 00:57:14,944
(dog whines)

848
00:57:18,785 --> 00:57:20,548
God damn, J.T.

849
00:57:22,055 --> 00:57:23,044
Yah!

850
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:26,949
(grunting)

851
00:57:31,397 --> 00:57:33,194
- (sighs)
- (J.T. chuckles)

852
00:57:33,194 --> 00:57:34,460
Barbecue?

853
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,866
Asshole.

854
00:57:38,905 --> 00:57:41,305
Damn good sausage link, J.T.

855
00:57:41,305 --> 00:57:43,103
Best in Texas.

856
00:57:43,103 --> 00:57:45,337
Must've passed out
after I killed those things.

857
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,404
Nice shootin'.

858
00:57:48,404 --> 00:57:50,779
Everybody gather up supplies.

859
00:57:50,779 --> 00:57:52,408
We head out in 20!

860
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,614
I think I nailed it.

861
00:57:57,614 --> 00:57:59,749
Holy shit, I think I finally cracked it.

862
00:57:59,749 --> 00:58:03,159
I finally found my--
my award-winning barbecue sauce!

863
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,230
Your blood's in it.

864
00:58:10,436 --> 00:58:12,336
God damn it, he's right.

865
00:58:13,272 --> 00:58:15,934
(horn honking)

866
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:22,505
(honking)

867
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,846
(honking)

868
00:58:30,056 --> 00:58:31,785
Hey, my other tooth fell out.

869
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:34,623
Heh.

870
00:58:36,229 --> 00:58:37,753
It sure did.

871
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,793
Hey, your tooth fell out, too.

872
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:46,734
We're toothless buddies.

873
00:58:46,734 --> 00:58:49,240
Oh, we sure are.

874
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,217
I want you to open that for Mommy.

875
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,848
Now, take the gun.

876
00:59:06,025 --> 00:59:07,890
Careful.

877
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:11,794
And if anyone comes to the door
that isn't me,

878
00:59:11,794 --> 00:59:13,889
I want you to shoot them, okay?

879
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:15,991
I'm not kidding, Tony.

880
00:59:15,991 --> 00:59:17,730
You shoot them...

881
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:19,829
just like your video games.

882
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:22,841
You shoot them in the head.

883
00:59:22,841 --> 00:59:24,774
What if it's Dad?

884
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:27,870
Especially if it's your dad.

885
00:59:39,025 --> 00:59:40,083
(gasps)

886
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:42,559
And be careful
where you point that thing.

887
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:43,993
You'll blow your own face off.

888
00:59:43,993 --> 00:59:45,860
I'll be right back.

889
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,661
I love you.
(kiss)

890
00:59:48,661 --> 00:59:50,258
(kiss)

891
01:00:00,613 --> 01:00:01,637
(gunshot)

892
01:00:04,917 --> 01:00:07,545
(screaming)

893
01:00:09,455 --> 01:00:10,444
Tony!

894
01:00:12,158 --> 01:00:13,158
Aah!

895
01:00:14,327 --> 01:00:15,624
Hello, baby.

896
01:00:18,264 --> 01:00:19,253
(rip)

897
01:00:19,253 --> 01:00:20,458
Ohh!

898
01:00:21,434 --> 01:00:23,265
(snarling)

899
01:00:32,078 --> 01:00:33,978
I'm gonna eat your brains...

900
01:00:35,114 --> 01:00:37,378
and gain your knowledge.

901
01:00:37,378 --> 01:00:38,246
Stay away!

902
01:00:43,122 --> 01:00:45,955
Look what you did to our son!

903
01:00:53,466 --> 01:00:54,728
Stay away!

904
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,200
God damn it, I told you
I didn't want to see you again.

905
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:03,920
Daddy!

906
01:01:06,379 --> 01:01:07,869
(snarling)

907
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:09,574
Get your sorry ass in here!

908
01:01:09,574 --> 01:01:10,638
Aah!

909
01:01:13,152 --> 01:01:16,246
If it's escape vehicles you want,
escape vehicles I got.

910
01:01:16,246 --> 01:01:17,619
Right this way.

911
01:01:18,524 --> 01:01:19,786
Watch that meat.

912
01:01:19,786 --> 01:01:21,257
Meet my wife.

913
01:01:21,257 --> 01:01:22,988
(chuckles)

914
01:01:22,988 --> 01:01:25,086
Jesse James Custom Dominator.

915
01:01:25,086 --> 01:01:27,564
I made Jesse a plate of barbecue
so goddamn good,

916
01:01:27,564 --> 01:01:30,067
he made this baby for me
free of fuckin' charge. Heh heh heh.

917
01:01:30,067 --> 01:01:32,161
Got anything that could
transport more people?

918
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,930
Where's the top?

919
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:38,238
This baby's chopped permanent.

920
01:01:38,238 --> 01:01:40,336
Ain't got no roll bar, chicken wire,
none of that shit.

921
01:01:40,336 --> 01:01:42,346
- No protection.
- But she's fast.

922
01:01:42,346 --> 01:01:45,384
Nitrous-injected,
350-horsepower engine.

923
01:01:45,384 --> 01:01:47,282
Who are you?

924
01:01:47,282 --> 01:01:48,411
I mean, really.

925
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:50,716
Wray's Wreckage.

926
01:01:50,716 --> 01:01:52,781
That's what it says on your truck.

927
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,822
Are you a wrecker, Wray?

928
01:01:59,822 --> 01:02:01,729
I'm nobody.

929
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:05,133
It's the easiest thing to remember.

930
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:07,501
So remember it.

931
01:02:10,877 --> 01:02:12,936
J.T.: Just stack them
on top of the counter.

932
01:02:15,248 --> 01:02:16,875
Hey, you want some barbecue?

933
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:19,076
Heh heh heh. Best in Texas.

934
01:02:19,076 --> 01:02:20,675
Aw, no, thanks.

935
01:02:20,675 --> 01:02:22,345
What's the matter,
you don't eat meat?

936
01:02:22,345 --> 01:02:24,082
Oh, I eat meat.

937
01:02:24,082 --> 01:02:26,590
I also eat lots of shit.

938
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:28,456
You see this?

939
01:02:28,456 --> 01:02:29,721
What's that?

940
01:02:29,721 --> 01:02:31,092
Shit-eating grin.

941
01:02:31,092 --> 01:02:32,391
(laughs)

942
01:02:32,391 --> 01:02:34,626
You ought to be a comedian.
(laughs)

943
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,099
What do you think of the leg?

944
01:02:36,099 --> 01:02:38,398
Oh, that's funny.
(laughs)

945
01:02:39,972 --> 01:02:41,496
How's your stump?

946
01:02:41,496 --> 01:02:43,439
They knocked it out something fierce.

947
01:02:43,439 --> 01:02:44,669
Still can't feel a thing.

948
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,977
<i>This must be the real Bone Shack.</i>

949
01:02:48,977 --> 01:02:50,675
(sighs, waterbed sloshes)

950
01:02:50,675 --> 01:02:53,378
Old J.T. knows how to live.

951
01:02:53,378 --> 01:02:55,852
Like fuck he does.

952
01:02:58,758 --> 01:03:00,623
I like how you say "fuck".

953
01:03:00,623 --> 01:03:02,752
Good. Fuck you.

954
01:03:03,729 --> 01:03:05,026
Fuck me?

955
01:03:08,768 --> 01:03:11,396
<i>Oh, so, now you're the comedian.</i>

956
01:03:11,396 --> 01:03:13,700
Go ahead, drop your pants.

957
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,934
That'll be good for a laugh.

958
01:03:15,934 --> 01:03:18,408
I highly doubt that.

959
01:03:24,517 --> 01:03:26,542
That's my jacket.

960
01:03:26,542 --> 01:03:28,553
Yes, I know.

961
01:03:28,553 --> 01:03:30,589
I looked for it for two weeks.

962
01:03:31,524 --> 01:03:35,483
Look, you were being
an unbelievable dick.

963
01:03:35,483 --> 01:03:37,791
I was walking out on you.

964
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:41,196
I was cold.
I took your fucking jacket.

965
01:03:41,196 --> 01:03:44,964
So, if you're gonna go on one of your
psycho obsessive controlling rants

966
01:03:44,964 --> 01:03:46,971
about a fucking jacket,
then fucking take it,

967
01:03:46,971 --> 01:03:50,270
because I'd rather fucking freeze
than fucking hear about it one more time.

968
01:03:52,511 --> 01:03:54,274
Did you find what was in the pocket?

969
01:03:54,274 --> 01:03:56,008
Fuck no.

970
01:03:56,008 --> 01:03:57,447
Look for it.

971
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,185
No, the other one.

972
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,363
I was gonna give it to you,
but you left me.

973
01:04:16,002 --> 01:04:17,560
You took the jacket.

974
01:04:18,738 --> 01:04:22,003
(together)
And I looked for it for two weeks.

975
01:04:23,275 --> 01:04:24,367
Read it.

976
01:04:32,218 --> 01:04:34,015
"Two against the world."

977
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,120
Remember that?

978
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,350
I never forgot it.

979
01:04:42,294 --> 01:04:44,785
Then why'd you leave?

980
01:04:46,065 --> 01:04:48,295
Because you didn't believe in us,

981
01:04:48,295 --> 01:04:49,766
or in me.

982
01:05:06,886 --> 01:05:07,875
(moans)

983
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:38,582
(whirring and clicking)

984
01:05:40,953 --> 01:05:42,716
(films slows down)

985
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:02,864
(snarling)

986
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:08,013
(grunting)

987
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:14,485
I figured one of them new deputies
might end up shootin' me,

988
01:06:14,485 --> 01:06:16,180
but not you, Tolo!

989
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,745
Sorry. I'm sorry.

990
01:06:17,745 --> 01:06:19,722
- Dumbass.
- You're gonna be all right.

991
01:06:19,722 --> 01:06:21,282
- McGraw's here.
- WOMAN: Now, now, now.

992
01:06:21,282 --> 01:06:23,487
- And a whole bunch of others.
- Everybody in!

993
01:06:23,487 --> 01:06:24,551
Come on!

994
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:26,120
Over here.

995
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,824
Move your ass! Come on!

996
01:06:32,872 --> 01:06:35,773
(speaking Spanish)

997
01:06:38,544 --> 01:06:39,738
(groans)

998
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,107
(groans)

999
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:47,916
What did I tell you, Tony?

1000
01:06:48,954 --> 01:06:51,354
Don't point the gun at yourself.

1001
01:06:52,158 --> 01:06:54,126
Didn't I tell you that?

1002
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,756
Thank you for telling me about...

1003
01:06:57,756 --> 01:06:58,888
you know.

1004
01:06:58,888 --> 01:07:00,829
Don't mention it.

1005
01:07:00,829 --> 01:07:02,731
That's an order.

1006
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:04,496
If I had known that you were...

1007
01:07:07,406 --> 01:07:08,998
<i>El Wray...</i>

1008
01:07:08,998 --> 01:07:11,338
I wouldn't have given you
such a hard time.

1009
01:07:11,338 --> 01:07:14,037
I didn't mean to be a prick about it.

1010
01:07:14,037 --> 01:07:16,604
Need-to-know basis, that kind of shit.

1011
01:07:16,604 --> 01:07:18,013
Take this.

1012
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,844
Do what you do best.

1013
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,023
No, you're not!

1014
01:07:26,023 --> 01:07:27,490
<i>Don't give him the gun. Not--</i>

1015
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:29,083
Give him the gun, Tolo.

1016
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:31,095
(Sheriff Hague grunting)

1017
01:07:31,095 --> 01:07:32,755
Give him the gun.

1018
01:07:33,899 --> 01:07:35,491
Give him all the guns.

1019
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:47,368
(rock music playing)

1020
01:07:48,781 --> 01:07:50,715
Holy shit.

1021
01:07:53,619 --> 01:07:55,177
That boy's got the devil in him.

1022
01:07:58,457 --> 01:07:59,481
We gotta fight them off.

1023
01:08:00,426 --> 01:08:01,893
Get to our vehicles.

1024
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:04,955
Everyone behind me!

1025
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:06,691
(snarling)

1026
01:08:10,236 --> 01:08:11,726
(screaming)

1027
01:08:14,139 --> 01:08:15,572
(snarling)

1028
01:08:16,308 --> 01:08:17,798
Outside now!

1029
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,947
(speaking Spanish)

1030
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:37,955
God damn you!

1031
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,269
(snarling)

1032
01:08:48,307 --> 01:08:50,275
Everybody back inside!

1033
01:08:59,318 --> 01:09:00,876
You, Skip.

1034
01:09:00,876 --> 01:09:01,920
Front and center.

1035
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,718
You go out front,
start up the Kill Dozer.

1036
01:09:05,718 --> 01:09:07,918
We'll need it to transport
the other survivors.

1037
01:09:07,918 --> 01:09:10,427
You fuckin' crazy?
I'm not goin' out there.

1038
01:09:10,427 --> 01:09:12,929
- I'll cover you.
- I'm not goin'.

1039
01:09:12,929 --> 01:09:14,431
I never miss.

1040
01:09:14,431 --> 01:09:16,468
Come on, Skip.

1041
01:09:16,468 --> 01:09:18,400
It's go-go.

1042
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:20,370
Not cry-cry.

1043
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:22,464
Cherry!

1044
01:09:26,378 --> 01:09:28,278
(snarling)

1045
01:09:32,718 --> 01:09:34,276
Oh, dear.

1046
01:09:36,622 --> 01:09:38,419
(growling)

1047
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:43,355
- (grunting)
- Ah!

1048
01:09:57,376 --> 01:09:58,707
(growling)

1049
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:00,934
Aah!

1050
01:10:21,867 --> 01:10:22,993
J.T.!

1051
01:10:22,993 --> 01:10:24,865
You take whoever you can fit
in your convertible.

1052
01:10:24,865 --> 01:10:26,028
Everyone else on board!

1053
01:10:26,028 --> 01:10:27,697
Skip, grab the twins!
Come along with me!

1054
01:10:27,697 --> 01:10:30,036
You take the chopper.

1055
01:10:30,036 --> 01:10:31,736
I need someone else
to drive my truck!

1056
01:10:31,736 --> 01:10:33,141
I'll do it.

1057
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,207
You're bleedin' like a stuck pig.

1058
01:10:37,207 --> 01:10:39,375
Your vision's blurred
and you're on your last legs.

1059
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:40,748
Anything else?

1060
01:10:40,748 --> 01:10:42,343
Don't wreck it.

1061
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,255
Somebody grab the slaw!

1062
01:10:45,255 --> 01:10:47,189
You can't have no barbecue
without coleslaw!

1063
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:48,817
- Give me a gun.
- Take this.

1064
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:51,056
Fucking cool!

1065
01:10:53,031 --> 01:10:55,090
All right, y'all, head out.
I'll hold them off.

1066
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,095
I can take care of myself.

1067
01:10:59,738 --> 01:11:01,365
Bye, Daddy.

1068
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:04,632
Do you remember how to ride a bike?

1069
01:11:04,632 --> 01:11:06,473
Useless talent number 32.

1070
01:11:06,473 --> 01:11:07,705
(revs engine)

1071
01:11:07,705 --> 01:11:08,804
Good.

1072
01:11:08,804 --> 01:11:10,610
Anyone else have a car?

1073
01:11:15,721 --> 01:11:17,552
Now, you're sure you're okay
driving this thing?

1074
01:11:17,552 --> 01:11:18,954
Hell yeah.

1075
01:11:21,994 --> 01:11:24,554
Dakota...
we're sorry about Tony.

1076
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:26,456
Thanks.

1077
01:11:27,566 --> 01:11:30,057
Your engine is shot
and you've got three blown tires.

1078
01:11:30,057 --> 01:11:32,126
But I've got his pocket bike
in the trunk.

1079
01:11:33,972 --> 01:11:35,371
Is it fast?

1080
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:37,432
Zero to fifty in four seconds.

1081
01:11:37,432 --> 01:11:39,443
You ride with her.

1082
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,207
I'm Cherry.

1083
01:11:42,207 --> 01:11:43,805
You sure are.

1084
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:46,611
Move out!

1085
01:11:46,611 --> 01:11:48,709
Damn shame.

1086
01:12:09,808 --> 01:12:11,571
(growling)

1087
01:12:12,344 --> 01:12:13,504
(shrieks)

1088
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,508
(grunts)

1089
01:12:22,154 --> 01:12:23,644
- (barks)
- Rusty!

1090
01:12:23,644 --> 01:12:25,586
- (yelps)
- Aah!

1091
01:12:25,586 --> 01:12:27,090
God damn it!

1092
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:28,148
Aah!

1093
01:12:33,332 --> 01:12:35,266
(growling)

1094
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,249
(snarling)

1095
01:13:04,563 --> 01:13:07,396
Sheriff! How much ammo we got?

1096
01:13:09,368 --> 01:13:10,801
Not enough.

1097
01:13:14,506 --> 01:13:17,168
(machine gun fire, growling)

1098
01:13:23,248 --> 01:13:26,081
Don't shoot!
We're not infected!

1099
01:13:35,127 --> 01:13:37,789
MULDOON:
All survivors gotta come with us.

1100
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:40,491
Especially you...

1101
01:13:41,767 --> 01:13:43,496
El Wray.

1102
01:13:43,496 --> 01:13:46,003
I don't go by that name anymore.

1103
01:13:46,003 --> 01:13:47,163
(Cherry screams)

1104
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,942
(grunts)

1105
01:13:59,751 --> 01:14:02,515
It's okay. It's okay.

1106
01:14:04,156 --> 01:14:06,784
We're here in quarantine
with the other survivors.

1107
01:14:06,784 --> 01:14:08,723
(man coughing)

1108
01:14:17,069 --> 01:14:18,331
Where is here?

1109
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:21,233
CHERRY: The old army base.

1110
01:14:22,174 --> 01:14:24,074
El Wray?

1111
01:14:25,744 --> 01:14:27,041
That you?

1112
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:31,038
He's with them.
I saw him in their convoy earlier.

1113
01:14:31,038 --> 01:14:32,879
I'm a scientist...

1114
01:14:32,879 --> 01:14:35,385
and a businessman.
Not military.

1115
01:14:35,385 --> 01:14:39,151
Which is why he's gonna tell us
what the fuck is going on.

1116
01:14:40,759 --> 01:14:42,954
They're stealing biochemical weapons.

1117
01:14:42,954 --> 01:14:44,323
DC-2?

1118
01:14:44,323 --> 01:14:46,762
Also known as "Project Terror."

1119
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:50,865
Designed to take out an entire populace
in a controlled landlocked area.

1120
01:14:50,865 --> 01:14:52,904
You were supplying it to them.

1121
01:14:54,172 --> 01:14:57,232
- That's why they shut you out.
- They found my supply.

1122
01:14:57,232 --> 01:14:59,277
It's under our feet.

1123
01:14:59,277 --> 01:15:01,278
Ten stories down.

1124
01:15:01,278 --> 01:15:03,780
What about countering
with atropine and PAM-2?

1125
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:07,717
Interferes with the neurotoxic delivery,
sets off the cell-blaster,

1126
01:15:07,717 --> 01:15:11,244
and you're gushing blood and pus
through every sacred hole in your body.

1127
01:15:11,244 --> 01:15:12,756
Appetizing.

1128
01:15:12,756 --> 01:15:16,453
The only treatment
is a regimented exposure to DC-2 itself.

1129
01:15:16,453 --> 01:15:18,086
It delays the negative effects.

1130
01:15:18,086 --> 01:15:19,630
They need it...

1131
01:15:20,732 --> 01:15:21,960
like a drug.

1132
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,594
Correct. But we found that
a small percentage of people

1133
01:15:24,594 --> 01:15:26,831
are not affected by the gas itself,

1134
01:15:26,831 --> 01:15:29,430
and within this small percentage
lies a cure.

1135
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:31,135
What do you want to do?

1136
01:15:34,146 --> 01:15:35,807
Mexico.

1137
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,677
Put our backs against the ocean

1138
01:15:37,677 --> 01:15:39,341
and defend ourselves from there.

1139
01:15:39,341 --> 01:15:41,282
No. We have to get back to my lab.

1140
01:15:41,282 --> 01:15:43,344
This infection will spread
all over the world,

1141
01:15:43,344 --> 01:15:45,413
to every man, woman and child,

1142
01:15:45,413 --> 01:15:47,048
unless I finish my antidote.

1143
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:49,786
You have an antidote?

1144
01:15:49,786 --> 01:15:50,987
(door opens)

1145
01:15:57,502 --> 01:15:59,436
You! You!

1146
01:15:59,436 --> 01:16:00,402
Come with us.

1147
01:16:01,707 --> 01:16:02,731
Move it!

1148
01:16:03,608 --> 01:16:04,973
Move it, Peggy!

1149
01:16:08,413 --> 01:16:09,311
Uhh!

1150
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:24,322
(muffled)
Do you like Ava Gardner?

1151
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:26,657
I'm sorry?

1152
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,160
Ava Gardner.
Do you like her?

1153
01:16:34,806 --> 01:16:36,239
Yeah, I guess.

1154
01:16:37,109 --> 01:16:39,168
I was just thinking that you, uh...

1155
01:16:39,168 --> 01:16:41,269
kind of look like Ava Gardner
a little bit.

1156
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:47,241
(elevator stops)

1157
01:16:49,254 --> 01:16:51,245
You got something
you want to say to me?

1158
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:54,287
I have nothing to say to you.

1159
01:16:54,287 --> 01:16:56,259
You got nothing to say, huh?
That's funny.

1160
01:16:56,259 --> 01:16:59,354
because I could've swore you just
gave me a "fuck you" look right now.

1161
01:17:00,232 --> 01:17:01,756
You want to say "fuck you" to me?

1162
01:17:02,434 --> 01:17:03,992
Not at this moment.

1163
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:08,229
You know what this is?

1164
01:17:09,775 --> 01:17:11,299
A gun.

1165
01:17:11,299 --> 01:17:13,469
It's simplicity itself.

1166
01:17:14,412 --> 01:17:16,471
You see, you point it
at what you want to die...

1167
01:17:17,415 --> 01:17:19,406
and you pull the little trigger here...

1168
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:22,550
and a little bullet comes out of here.

1169
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,886
And the little bullet
hits you right there.

1170
01:17:26,992 --> 01:17:28,186
And you know what?

1171
01:17:29,961 --> 01:17:31,952
You don't look like
Ava Gardner no more.

1172
01:17:34,332 --> 01:17:35,799
(holsters gun)

1173
01:17:37,469 --> 01:17:39,562
Don't taunt me, tramp.

1174
01:17:39,562 --> 01:17:42,937
I am not one to be taunted.

1175
01:17:42,937 --> 01:17:44,133
You got it?

1176
01:17:47,078 --> 01:17:49,239
Let me here you say, "I got it."

1177
01:17:49,239 --> 01:17:51,646
I got it.

1178
01:17:51,646 --> 01:17:53,581
You damn well better.

1179
01:17:57,622 --> 01:17:59,487
(elevator starts up)

1180
01:18:00,992 --> 01:18:02,892
Tool.

1181
01:18:02,892 --> 01:18:05,020
(saxophone playing)

1182
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:10,198
J.T.: (whispering)
God damn it, that's it.

1183
01:18:11,069 --> 01:18:12,764
I figured it out.

1184
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,201
Salt.

1185
01:18:15,201 --> 01:18:16,740
Got it all figured out. It's salt.

1186
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:18,298
Blood is salty.
(laughs)

1187
01:18:18,298 --> 01:18:20,810
That's all my sauce needed,
was just a little more salt.

1188
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,975
It just needed a little thickening agent.
You know what I'm talkin' about?

1189
01:18:23,975 --> 01:18:25,174
What are you doing, J.T.?

1190
01:18:25,174 --> 01:18:27,184
That's all I gotta do,
is put a little more salt in.

1191
01:18:27,184 --> 01:18:29,583
It'd just do the same goddamn thing
that the blood did.

1192
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:32,054
I tell you what, brother,
that little bit of blood did the trick.

1193
01:18:32,054 --> 01:18:34,023
Don't do nothin' stupid, J.T.
I got it covered.

1194
01:18:34,023 --> 01:18:37,061
It's already got my sweat, it's got my tears.
Now all it needs is some blood!

1195
01:18:40,832 --> 01:18:42,129
- Drop the gun!
- J.T.!

1196
01:18:42,129 --> 01:18:43,758
(grunting)

1197
01:18:43,758 --> 01:18:45,325
- Do it now!
- Okay, okay!

1198
01:18:45,325 --> 01:18:46,802
Don't shoot!

1199
01:18:46,802 --> 01:18:48,032
J.T., you all right?

1200
01:18:48,032 --> 01:18:48,901
(J.T. grunts)

1201
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:50,536
Uhh!

1202
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,173
Hey, you all right, bro?

1203
01:18:59,173 --> 01:19:01,115
J.T.: God damn it,
I'm not all right at all, brother.

1204
01:19:01,115 --> 01:19:02,619
Not at all.

1205
01:19:02,619 --> 01:19:04,314
Wait here.

1206
01:19:04,314 --> 01:19:06,550
Oh... I sure will.

1207
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:08,558
(chuckles)

1208
01:19:08,558 --> 01:19:10,628
Goddamn sauce.

1209
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,169

She's got one leg.

1219
01:19:41,419 --> 01:19:43,154
Easier access.

1220
01:19:45,263 --> 01:19:46,594
You got a point.

1221
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,405
Get the rest of this shit upstairs

Lewis?

1231
01:20:30,638 --> 01:20:31,767
Wilson?

1232
01:20:31,767 --> 01:20:33,844
(machines power down)

1233
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:48,885
Where are my men?

01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:51,053

What the fuck's this?

1237
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:57,128
Their balls, sweetheart.

1238
01:21:00,805 --> 01:21:03,103
I'm walking out of here
with this shit, Wray.

1239
01:21:03,103 --> 01:21:05,404
- Let us go.
- Tell me why we should.

1240
01:21:05,404 --> 01:21:06,501
Because I earned it.

1241
01:21:06,501 --> 01:21:08,135
How do you figure that?

1242
01:21:08,135 --> 01:21:11,512
You want the story?
I'll spin it for you quick.

1243
01:21:11,512 --> 01:21:14,450
A termite's nest of caves
on the Afghan border,

1244
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:17,647
me and my men walking around
with our dicks in our hands

1245
01:21:17,647 --> 01:21:21,453
and our balls in our throats,
lookin' for America's most wanted.

1246
01:21:21,453 --> 01:21:23,016
- Bin Laden.
- Yeah.

1247
01:21:23,016 --> 01:21:25,221
For once, our intel
was right on the money.

1248
01:21:25,221 --> 01:21:26,524
I come around a corner--

1249
01:21:26,524 --> 01:21:28,532
bam, there he is,
lookin' me right in the eyes.

1250
01:21:28,532 --> 01:21:29,726
Wait.

1251
01:21:29,726 --> 01:21:31,769
You killed bin Laden?

1252
01:21:31,769 --> 01:21:35,203
I put two in his heart,
one in his computer.

1253
01:21:35,203 --> 01:21:37,297
So that was you.

1254
01:21:37,297 --> 01:21:38,672
Yeah.

1255
01:21:39,544 --> 01:21:40,841
That was me.

1256
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:44,971
Class-A clusterfuck.

1257
01:21:44,971 --> 01:21:48,349
He wasn't supposed to be there,
we weren't supposed to be there,

1258
01:21:48,349 --> 01:21:52,254
and I sure as fuck wasn't supposed to be
the one to punch his dialysis ticket.

1259
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:56,225
So, instead of a chest full of medals,
we get a face full of DC-2.

1260
01:21:56,225 --> 01:21:58,454
No cure.

1261
01:21:58,454 --> 01:22:00,964
That is, not until we found
somebody from the other side

1262
01:22:00,964 --> 01:22:03,057
willing to sell us batches of this shit.

1263
01:22:03,057 --> 01:22:06,399
Science comes first, but business
comes a close fucking second.

1264
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:09,963
WRAY: Then you realized if you could
infect a large enough populace,

1265
01:22:09,963 --> 01:22:13,169
the experiment and its survivors,

1266
01:22:13,169 --> 01:22:14,905
you'd find a cure.

1267
01:22:14,905 --> 01:22:17,675
I swore to my men
that I'd do everything in my power

1268
01:22:17,675 --> 01:22:19,239
to keep them alive.

1269
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:21,477
And that's what I intend to do, Wray.

1270
01:22:21,477 --> 01:22:23,578
(Muldoon groaning, skin bubbling)

1271
01:22:23,578 --> 01:22:25,019
Understand?

1272
01:22:26,558 --> 01:22:28,890
I never had a choice.

1273
01:22:29,928 --> 01:22:31,828
(snarling)

1274
01:22:31,828 --> 01:22:33,295
Neither do I, sir.

1275
01:22:36,167 --> 01:22:38,135
God bless you
and your service to this country.

1276
01:22:39,604 --> 01:22:40,263
(snarls)

1277
01:22:44,909 --> 01:22:46,206
You're a doctor?

1278
01:22:46,911 --> 01:22:48,003
Heh.

1279
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:50,845
I was earlier tonight.

1280
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:54,981
I always wanted to be a doctor.

1281
01:22:54,981 --> 01:22:58,284
Instead, I can do...

1282
01:22:58,284 --> 01:22:59,755
this.

1283
01:22:59,755 --> 01:23:03,692
Ohh. Useless talent number 66.

1284
01:23:07,732 --> 01:23:08,994
I'm very pliable.

1285
01:23:08,994 --> 01:23:10,694
DAKOTA: A girlfriend of mine
had a theory.

1286
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:14,204
She said at some point in your life,

1287
01:23:14,204 --> 01:23:17,469
you find a use for every useless talent
you ever had.

1288
01:23:18,409 --> 01:23:20,502
It's like, uh, connecting the dots.

1289
01:23:20,502 --> 01:23:22,910
I'm not that optimistic.

1290
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:26,542
I feel like I'm sinking down the drain
and I can't get out.

1291
01:23:26,542 --> 01:23:27,880
She'd say...

1292
01:23:28,753 --> 01:23:30,721
when you're stuck in that spiral...

1293
01:23:31,723 --> 01:23:33,088
you reach up.

1294
01:23:33,892 --> 01:23:36,793
What if there's nothing up there?

1295
01:23:37,695 --> 01:23:39,424
Just reach up.

1296
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:42,494
You're a dancer.

1297
01:23:42,494 --> 01:23:45,068
I was earlier tonight.

1298
01:23:45,068 --> 01:23:47,730
Well, I'm pulling you out of retirement!

1299

(grunting)

1300
01:23:50,408 --> 01:23:52,535
Get your ass up!

1301
01:23:54,445 --> 01:23:57,937
Now, I'm starved for entertainment, baby,

1307
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:14,060
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1308
01:24:15,066 --> 01:24:16,294
Dance it up.

1309
01:24:17,936 --> 01:24:19,403
Keep dancing!

01:24:27,111 --> 01:24:30,046
but ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

1313
01:24:30,046 --> 01:24:32,844
I have seen me a stripper
with one breast,

1314
01:24:32,844 --> 01:24:35,886
and I've seen me a stripper
with 12 toes,

1315
01:24:35,886 --> 01:24:38,478
and I've seen me a stripper
with no brains at all,

1316

but I ain't never seen me

And I've been to Morocco.

1318
01:24:44,762 --> 01:24:46,525
Dance, bitch!

1319
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,096
Break a leg!

1320
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:53,228
Break it off! Ha ha!

01:25:06,814 --> 01:25:07,578
Aah!

1325
01:25:07,578 --> 01:25:08,298
Ohhhh!

1326
01:25:11,222 --> 01:25:13,019
(grunting)

1327
01:25:18,896 --> 01:25:21,057
You thought it was pretty funny,
didn't you?

1328
01:25:21,057 --> 01:25:23,656
Actually, yes.

1329
01:25:23,656 --> 01:25:25,703
You gave me some wood,

1330
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:27,761
now I'm gonna give you...

1331
01:25:27,761 --> 01:25:30,865
some fuckin' wood!

1332
01:25:30,865 --> 01:25:32,910
Ah-- ah!

1333
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:35,946
(dramatic music playing)

1334
01:25:39,284 --> 01:25:40,273
(gasps)

1335
01:25:40,273 --> 01:25:41,273
Ahh!

1336
01:25:43,421 --> 01:25:45,946
The gas! You need your gas!

1337
01:25:45,946 --> 01:25:48,083
No! Fuck the gas, fuck it.

1338
01:25:48,083 --> 01:25:50,593
I'm just gonna have to make this quick.

1339
01:25:50,593 --> 01:25:52,663
(grunting)

1340
01:25:58,036 --> 01:25:59,503
(laughing)

1341
01:26:01,973 --> 01:26:03,304
Aah!

1342
01:26:03,304 --> 01:26:04,602
Uhh!

1343
01:26:04,602 --> 01:26:06,609
Where'd you get that?

1344
01:26:06,609 --> 01:26:08,838
Useless talent number 37.

1345
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:11,976
Aaaaah!

1346
01:26:15,953 --> 01:26:17,716
(knuckles crack)

1347
01:26:19,257 --> 01:26:21,282
(groaning)

1348
01:26:23,494 --> 01:26:25,086
(banging)

1349
01:26:31,602 --> 01:26:33,593
Uhh! Uhh!

1350
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:37,002
I broke my leg.

1351
01:26:37,002 --> 01:26:39,805
That's okay.
I made you something.

1352
01:26:40,912 --> 01:26:42,470
(clang)

1353
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:44,673
I do believe in you.

1354
01:26:45,516 --> 01:26:46,915
Always have.

1355
01:26:46,915 --> 01:26:49,578
I believe that you could be better.

1356
01:26:49,578 --> 01:26:51,952
You deserve better,

1357
01:26:51,952 --> 01:26:53,684
even better than me.

1358
01:26:54,559 --> 01:26:55,787
Right now,

1359
01:26:55,787 --> 01:26:57,794
I need you to become...

1360
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:00,957
who you're meant to be.

1361
01:27:01,866 --> 01:27:03,060
Stand.

1362
01:27:06,337 --> 01:27:08,532
(grunting)

1363
01:27:08,532 --> 01:27:10,971
I'd stand clear if I were you.

1364
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,204
(grunting)

1365
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:19,442
Open that door, will you, baby?

1366
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:34,030
Uhh!

1367
01:27:36,367 --> 01:27:39,063
(music playing on radio)

1368
01:27:39,063 --> 01:27:40,263
(music stops)

1369
01:27:47,645 --> 01:27:49,772
They've destroyed most of the tanks.

1370
01:27:50,581 --> 01:27:53,141
Any that are left
we'll get on our way to the helicopters.

1371
01:27:53,141 --> 01:27:55,447
There are two helicopters,

1372
01:27:55,447 --> 01:27:57,545
big enough to take all of us.

1373
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:00,116
Who can fly?

1374
01:28:03,261 --> 01:28:05,661
Can anyone else fly a helicopter?

1375
01:28:05,661 --> 01:28:07,322
I can fly, but...

1376
01:28:07,322 --> 01:28:09,366
no way in hell I'm gonna fly tonight.

1377
01:28:09,366 --> 01:28:11,231
Okay. Cool.

1378
01:28:11,231 --> 01:28:12,563
I'll fly.

1379
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:15,065
Let's go.

1380
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:23,009
I think we're gonna stay here, Wray.

1381
01:28:24,215 --> 01:28:25,944
You'll take care of this for me,
then, Sheriff?

1382
01:28:27,218 --> 01:28:28,879
With pleasure.

1383
01:28:28,879 --> 01:28:30,215
Three minutes.

1384
01:28:31,155 --> 01:28:33,316
Your brother's a good man, J.T.

1385
01:28:33,316 --> 01:28:34,983
Best in Texas.

1386
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:39,355
Hop on.

1387
01:28:42,667 --> 01:28:44,032
No, the other way.

1388
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:44,782
Oh.

1389
01:28:48,039 --> 01:28:50,599
No. The other way.

1390
01:28:55,713 --> 01:28:57,578
(tires screech)

1391
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:20,569
(blows)

1392
01:29:37,788 --> 01:29:40,222
The helicopters are
on the other side of this wall.

1393
01:29:42,426 --> 01:29:44,417
(overlapping chatter)

1394
01:29:47,198 --> 01:29:48,460
We make a run for it!

1395
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:51,696
No! If we all get killed,
there's no stopping this plague.

1396
01:29:51,696 --> 01:29:53,030
Don't you get it?

1397
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:55,628
We're the antidote.

1398
01:29:55,628 --> 01:29:57,196
Well, is there another way around?

1399
01:29:57,196 --> 01:29:59,208
Wait here.

1400
01:30:03,548 --> 01:30:04,810
(weapon fires)

1401
01:30:18,396 --> 01:30:19,590
(weapon fires)

1402
01:30:25,436 --> 01:30:29,270
I don't suppose there are any other
biochemical engineers around? Heh.

1403
01:30:29,270 --> 01:30:31,001
- (weapon fires)
- Take that as a no.

1404
01:30:32,977 --> 01:30:34,604
We have to get over that wall!

1405
01:30:37,748 --> 01:30:41,184
I was thinkin' we could build us
a new place,

1406
01:30:41,184 --> 01:30:43,379
right there where the old one was.

1407
01:30:44,255 --> 01:30:45,813
You cook,

1408
01:30:45,813 --> 01:30:47,517
I work the back.

1409
01:30:48,826 --> 01:30:52,091
You don't make that rent
so goddamn high.

1410
01:30:52,091 --> 01:30:55,496
We share the recipe,
we share the rent.

1411
01:31:00,638 --> 01:31:02,936
Start at 250 degrees.

1412
01:31:06,177 --> 01:31:07,667
I knew it.

1413
01:31:07,667 --> 01:31:09,212
For how long?

1414
01:31:09,212 --> 01:31:11,680
- 12 pounds?
- Sure.

1415
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,944
12 pounds, 12 hours.

1416
01:31:13,944 --> 01:31:16,110
Wrapped in tin foil, right?

1417
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:18,314
I don't use no goddamn foil.

1418
01:31:18,314 --> 01:31:19,413
Damn.

1419
01:31:19,413 --> 01:31:21,753
Tomatoes? Fresh?

1420
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:24,159
Canned.

1421
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:25,889
- No shit?
- Yeah.

1422
01:31:25,889 --> 01:31:27,191
You score me some?

1423
01:31:27,191 --> 01:31:28,788
Oh, yeah.

1424
01:31:28,788 --> 01:31:30,867
because we're brothers.

1425
01:31:32,536 --> 01:31:34,697
Thank you for this.

1426
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:36,330
You just remember...

1427
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:39,308
you got to take this recipe
to your grave.

1428
01:31:39,308 --> 01:31:43,574
(straining) I think I can...
goddamn guarantee that.

1429
01:31:53,324 --> 01:31:54,284
(laughs)

1430
01:32:04,735 --> 01:32:06,100
(growling)

1431
01:32:08,506 --> 01:32:10,098
That's our cue.

1432
01:32:12,476 --> 01:32:14,137
Cherry, darling...

1433
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:17,379
it's all you.

1434
01:32:21,786 --> 01:32:23,617
(rock music playing)

1435
01:32:42,073 --> 01:32:44,132
(grunting)

1436
01:32:48,713 --> 01:32:49,975
Let's go!

1437
01:33:25,149 --> 01:33:27,276
(snarling)

1438
01:33:48,339 --> 01:33:49,863
(snarling)

1439
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:52,539
(grunting)

1440
01:33:55,246 --> 01:33:56,941
Aah!

1441
01:33:57,982 --> 01:33:59,108
Wray!

1442
01:34:02,286 --> 01:34:03,981
Damn it, Wray.

1443
01:34:03,981 --> 01:34:05,282
Ohh.

1444
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:09,584
Okay. You need to get up
because we're leaving.

1445
01:34:34,185 --> 01:34:36,585
They told me I'd find you here.

1446
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:42,825
I was beginning to lose hope.

1447
01:34:42,825 --> 01:34:44,690
I'm sorry...

1448
01:34:45,830 --> 01:34:47,491
but I lied.

1449
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:53,529
I did want to hurt you.

1450
01:34:55,172 --> 01:34:57,037
My turn.

1451
01:34:57,675 --> 01:34:59,165
(grunting)

1452
01:35:07,451 --> 01:35:11,148
No more dead bodies
for Daddy tonight.

1453
01:35:12,723 --> 01:35:15,214
Never did like that son of a bitch.

1454
01:35:16,994 --> 01:35:21,294
About as useless
as a pecker on a pope.

1455
01:35:27,504 --> 01:35:28,664
Don't touch anything.

1456
01:35:28,664 --> 01:35:30,034
I want to fly it.

1457
01:35:30,034 --> 01:35:32,337
- He said not to touch anything!
- You don't know what you're doing!

1458
01:35:32,337 --> 01:35:33,637
- I do know what I'm doing!
- No, you don't!

1459
01:35:33,637 --> 01:35:35,975
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Shut up, sit down...

1460
01:35:35,975 --> 01:35:37,843
and don't fuckin' touch anything!

1461
01:35:41,785 --> 01:35:44,276
(groaning)

1462
01:35:44,276 --> 01:35:45,481
Everybody sit down!

1463
01:35:52,363 --> 01:35:53,853
Whoo!

1464
01:35:53,853 --> 01:35:55,091
(snarling)

1465
01:35:55,091 --> 01:35:57,360
Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
R-r-r-r-rah-ha!

1466
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,436
(all grunting)

1467
01:36:02,206 --> 01:36:03,264
Hit the wipers.

1468
01:36:09,079 --> 01:36:10,603
Go on, leave me.

1469
01:36:10,603 --> 01:36:13,343
I am not leaving you here like this.

1470
01:36:13,343 --> 01:36:16,318
Motherfuckers around here
eat road kill.

1471
01:36:16,318 --> 01:36:18,048
(laughs)

1472
01:36:18,048 --> 01:36:20,784
See? I'm funny.

1473
01:36:21,525 --> 01:36:23,152
I made you laugh.

1474
01:36:23,152 --> 01:36:24,387
Go to the ocean.

1475
01:36:24,387 --> 01:36:27,521
Put your backs to it.
Protect yourselves there.

1476
01:36:27,521 --> 01:36:30,294
I'm not leaving you, Wray.

1477
01:36:31,468 --> 01:36:33,663
(crying)
It's two against the world.

1478
01:36:34,939 --> 01:36:36,531
It will be.

1479
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:39,441
I promise.

1480
01:36:40,277 --> 01:36:42,074
I never miss.

1481
01:36:43,514 --> 01:36:45,311
Don't worry, baby.

1482
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:48,218
You'll find your way.

1483
01:36:48,218 --> 01:36:51,254
(cries, mutters)

1484
01:36:52,256 --> 01:36:54,281
(grunts)

1485
01:36:54,281 --> 01:36:56,986
(Cherry sobbing)

1486
01:36:58,862 --> 01:37:00,830
(helicopter hovering overhead)

1487
01:37:03,267 --> 01:37:04,347
Reach up!

1488
01:37:18,615 --> 01:37:21,015
DAKOTA: Reach up!

1489
01:37:22,119 --> 01:37:24,417
(crying)

1490
01:37:29,159 --> 01:37:29,659
##
