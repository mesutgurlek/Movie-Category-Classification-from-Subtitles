It's a stimulant.

we really don't know.

327

overreaction to depression.

You think I should take her
to a psychiatrist?

No. I think we should wait

No. Why?

802

Have you ever heard of exorcism?

803
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,430
Well, it's a stylized ritual...

804
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:52,187
...in which the, uh, rabbi or the priest try
to drive out the so-called invading spirit.

805
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,439
It's been pretty much discarded
these days...

806
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:59,361
...except by the Catholics, who keep it
in the closet as a sort of embarrassment.

807
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:02,614
But it, uh, has worked, in fact...

808
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:05,701
...although not for the reasons they think,
of course.

809
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:09,621
It's purely force of suggestion.

810
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:14,585
The, uh... The victim's belief in possession
is what helped cause it...

811
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,378
...so in that same way...

812
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:19,798
...the belief in the power of exorcism
can make it disappear.

And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil...

845
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:12,906
...it isn't likely he would fall
from a window.

846
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:16,451
Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck

My opinion...

850
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:29,965
...he was killed by a very powerful man:
point one.

851
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,802
And the fracturing of his skull: point two...

...plus the various other things
we mentioned...

853
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:40,851
...would make it very probable...

...probable, not certain...

855
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:50,235

then pushed from your daughter's window.
