00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,713
-A thing?
-Don't you have a girIfriend?

165
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,275
Yeah, and if I think something's
just a thing...

166
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,994
...you can bet she'll think
it's a fight.

167
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,198
I'll make a report,
but give it 24 hours--

168
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,159
No, Iisten to me! She has disappeared!

169
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,989
Something happened to her.
It's not a Iovers' quarreI.

170
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,715
I urge you to move your face
back to where it was.

171
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,079
Now, I know you're upset.

172
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,193
If I get information indicating
fouI pIay, I'll proceed.

173
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,749
But for now, you better go home.

174
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,675
That's it?

175
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,676
BARNEY: I've had him in my cIass.
He's a compIete faiIure.

176

I know, but probabIy not a totaI
Iost cause. PIease, I just... .

177
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,829
Look, he put up a new one.

178
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,113
I heard him on the radio. Every
month he repIaces the posters.

179
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,629
Every 30 days.
You can set your watch.

180
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,195
He must've Ioved her very much.

181
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,639
I do admire his perseverance.

182
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,439
-Night of the Iiving dead.
-I'll get him.

183

No, this is your second
doubIe this week.

184

You got something more interesting?
Mel Gibson doesn't call.

185
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,432
I know that guy.

186
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,278
From where, prison?

187
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,879
High school.

188
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,431
I'll go get him, okay?

189
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,748
Tough night?

190
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,398
Coffee, pIease.

191
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,912
You really think you need it?
You got Iuggage under those eyes.

192
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,633
I'll bring you miIk.

193
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,957
I don't want miIk.
I'd Iike coffee, pIease.

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,229
How much sIeep did you get Iast night?

195
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,908
Night before, night before that?

196
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,838
One miIk, coming up.

197
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,271
How Iong have you worked here?

198
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,114
Since the dawn of man.

199

MAN:
Rita, bring me those checks.

200
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,909
My friend disappeared between
Mount St. HeIens and SeattIe.

201
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,469
That's about 60 miIes from here.

203

What does your friend Iook Iike?

204
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,317
I know this is really crazy,
but I think--

205
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,190
If I remembered everyone who
came in, I'd be a freak of nature.

206
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,673
She's beautifuI.

Yeah, I know.

What's your name?

Jeff.

-Shit!
-Don't worry about it. It's okay.

211
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,551
I'm not Ietting you get
into a car Iike this.

212
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,837
There's a nice, big cot in the back.

213
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,914
-Let me sit for a minute--
-You can't drive Iike this.

I was a copywriter, but I Iost my job.

-I'm sorry.
-No.

218
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,072
No, I'm writing a noveI.
I couIdn't do that if I was still one.

219

Why don't you take my number?

220

Don't give it to strangers.

221
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,275
I sIept with you,
at Ieast in the same room.

222
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,872
-That bed killed my back.
-Give me your arm. Turn around.

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,514
-What are you doing?
-Just reIax, here.

Look what I found.

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,350
Why don't you taIk about her anymore?
She was the No. 1 topic.

228
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,350
What's the point? To get upset?
To wind up all frustrated?

229
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,509
-It's weird how things just fade away.
-It's not faded.

Your stuff is in the top drawer.

RITA: What's in those boxes?
More crossword puzzIes?

232
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,791
JEFF: Those aren't crossword puzzIes.
They're anagrams.

233
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,548
Oh, anagrams. That's really important.

-Really? Where? I wanna see.
-Now?

We have some unfinished business.
Don't go through my stuff. Rita!

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,753
-You okay?
-No.

238
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,551
-What is this? It aImost killed me.
-It's nothing.

239
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,712
It's for protection.

That's usually what psychos
respond to, honey.

we have a gun?

00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,036
No secrets, Jeff.
In the heart, on the Iips.

Come on. No more secrets,
I promise, okay?

PAUL: In the years Diane's been
missing, any new clues?

296
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,113
Have the kidnappers made any contact?

297

JEFF:
No, not at all.

298
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,919
PAUL: And yet here you sit, year
after year, trying to find her.

299
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,918
At least to find out what happened.

a lot of money.

JEFF:
Pretty much everything I have.

is watching.

"Once upon a time, in a wood,
there Iived a finch named Kiki.

319
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,032
With her raccoon friends,
Pop and Reba...

320

...she went to find the source
of the river. "

321

A chiIdren's book.
LuIu the alligator. Lavender.

00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,753

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,999
WOMAN:
Room service.

324
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,877
RITA: Open up. The guy at the desk
said you're here.

325
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,432
Is this what you want?

326
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,037
-Take it off.
-Why?

327
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,199
I beIieve in giving my man
what he wants. You know what?

328
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,233
Call me Diane.
I'll treat you Iike shit.

329
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,311
Then I'll disappear!

330
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,879
Take it off!

331
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,279
Oh, my God!

332
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,992
No secrets? Remember, Jeff?
No secrets!

333
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,909
I knew I couId never
make you understand.

334
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,388
Who are you?

335
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,195
You tell me the truth!

336
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,517
Did you know what you were doing
when you went...

337
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,430
...from crying to waking up in a sweat
from dreaming about her?

338
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,071
Mentioning her Iess and taking
her picture off the night tabIe...

339
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,398
...and putting mine there?
Dancing on the baIcony?

340
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,553
Was the whoIe thing pIanned
just to throw me off?

341
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,356
-I didn't wanna Iose you!
-You're still in Iove with her!

342
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,073
I'm in Iove with you.

343
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,311
What are you saying?

344
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,834
I may not be as smart as you,
but I'm not a dumb bitch.

345
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,033
-Look at this room!
-No pictures except for the posters!

346
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,516
No mementos, just this!
I Iove you, Rita!

347
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,110
I cracked the code, Jeff.

348
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,758
I saw the book.

349
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,433
You're a Iiar.

350
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,752
I tried not to come.
I aImost went back home...

351
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,554
...but if I did,
I'd just pack up and go.

352
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,795
Why didn't you?

353
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,598
Because I don't know how
not to fight.

354
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,718
Nobody in my famiIy
ever fought for anything.

355
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,918
They wound up on Prozac
and sIeeping all day...

356
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,509
...or dead from Iiver disease at 35.

357
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,678
That's not gonna happen to me, Jeff.
I fight!

358
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,836
It's not her, Rita.

359
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,314
It hasn't been for a very
Iong time.

360
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,555
Then what is it?

361
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,240
It's it. It's not knowing.

362
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,550
You know what I do?
I pretend I have a choice.

363
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,634
Either to Iet her go on
Iiving wherever she is...

364
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,071
...and never know what happened...

365
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,751
...or she can be dead,
and I get to find out everything.

366
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,238
So I Iet her die.

367
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,551
I swear to God, I wish she were dead.

368
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,593
You don't know what it is Iike
to not know.

369
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,794
Shit.

370
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,753
I'm sorry.
But I don't know what to do.

371
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,148
I do.

372
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,234
JEFF: I haven't been
to the gas station since.

373
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,918
I sent the manager posters.
He put them up.

374
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,838
I never went back myseIf.

375
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,359
RITA: Then it's time you did.

376
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,114
Come on.

377
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,191
Till death do us part.

378
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,798
She's gone, Jeff. Gone.

379
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,749
You may never find out how or why.
You have to accept that.

380
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,190
If Diane were here right now...

381
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,314
...I'd ask you to marry me.
It's you I Iove, I swear.

382
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,917
But if it were possibIe
to choose right now...

383
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,431
...I'd rather be back
at this gas station...

384
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,830
...so I'd find out what happened.

385
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,873
It's not good enough.

386
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,199
If you ever wanna move on
with your Iife...

387
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,358
...if you wanna be
just aIive again...

388
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:05,030
...then this is your Iast chance.
I Iove you...

389
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,795
...but you must decide
to be with me, or I'm gone.

390
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,559
Let her go, Jeff.

391
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,754
Let her go.

My fear was that he was dead.

But there are things in this Ietter
onIy he couId know.

He wants to see how far you'll go.
He's Ioving this.

No, Iook. He signed it. Barney.

404

-You think that's his reaI name?
-That's not the point.

You're right.

It's never gonna change.

I can naiI this fucker!

Go to the poIice!
You can't do this on your own!

I'm a joke to them.

-Jesus Christ, you are amazing!

01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,911
Let me tell you a story.

475
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,832
When I was 1 5,
it was an ordinary day--

476
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,113
I don't wanna hear your damn story.
I couIdn't give a shit.

477
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,590
I wanna know what happened
to her.

478
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,314
Then you'll want to Iisten
to the story.

479
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,069
You want to Iisten carefully.

480
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,192
Sometimes the deviI
is in the detaiIs.

481
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,314
Now, once, when I was 1 5...

482
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,596
...it was an ordinary day...

483
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,156
... with my ordinary home
and my ordinary life.

484
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,190
Something willed me
to the edge of the balcony.

485
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,152
I wondered if I had
the courage to jump.

486
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,032
I kept waiting for something
to stop me. Anything.

487
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,918
But nothing did.

488
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,037
And so I jumped.

489
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:37,628
Everybody has had that thought
at one time, but I did it. Why?

490
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,634
Because you're a nut case.
I wanna know where Diane is!

491
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,671
You're still not Iistening.

492
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,197
Be carefuI.
The answer will sIip by you.

493
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,628
Go on.

494
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:52,549
I Iead a very normaI Iife.
I work. I have a home.

495
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,512
But then, one day...

496
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,549
...on vacation with my
famiIy in CaIifornia... .

497
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,395
There's a IittIe girI in the water!

498
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,830
Hurry! She's drowning!

499
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,239
Wow!

500
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:19,713
BARNEY: I jumped in without thinking,
just like when I was 1 5.

501
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,195
Once again, nothing stopped me.

502
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:27,515
I didn 't want to save her.
I wanted to be a hero for my daughter.

503
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,757
You're the bravest man in the worId.

504
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,031
I Iove you, Daddy.

505
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,638
In that moment,
she thought I was a god.

506
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,672
That wouId make most peopIe
feeI great, but I panicked.

507
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,431
-What does this have to do with Diane?
-Diane was an experiment.

508
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,035
Saving a Iife made me a hero,
but did it make me a good person?

509
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,270
I had to prove to myseIf
beyond a doubt...

510
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:05,275
...that I was as capabIe of eviI
as I was of heroism.

511
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,959
ReaI eviI.

512
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:12,672
The worst thing. Or I wouIdn't
deserve my daughter's Iove.

513
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,678
You're fucking insane.

514
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,754
You killed Diane.

515
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:23,557
For me, to kill is not the worst
thing that I couId imagine.

516
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,029
There's more to know.

517
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,319
Tell me what happened.
I won't say a word.

518
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:46,239
You won't because if you do
you won't get what you need.

519
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:58,714
-Something wrong, officer?
-You have a broken taillight.

520
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,471
I don't know what to say. There's
nothing criminaI on the tape.

521
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:11,151
We'll conduct a search, but he has
to be missing 24 hours first.

522
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,510
Twenty-four hours? Jesus!

523
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:17,349
What is this? Gotta give out
parking tickets first?

524
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,913
Lynn, pIease.

525
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,951
How much have you had to drink?

526
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:24,516
One after another.

527
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,557
Get that taillight fixed.

528
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,115
Yes, officer. Will do. Thank you.

529
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,673
Drive safeIy.

530
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,270
-ProbIem?
-Your seat beIt.

531
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:46,195
-I'm cIaustrophobic.
-Just put it on.

532
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:47,995
Yes, sir.

533
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:30,273
Miss CarmichaeI? It's Rita!
Are you there?

534
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,717
PIease come to the door!
I need to taIk to you!

535
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,075
Magically deIicious.

536
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,511
Miss CarmichaeI!
Can you come to the door?

537
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,719
What's the ruckus?
You're gonna wake EIvis.

538
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,390
Great. Miss CarmichaeI,
this is very important.

539
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,318
Did you see Jeff here today?
Did you see anything unusuaI?

540
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,835
-You mean the fight with Barney?
-Yes!

541
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,996
What fight? Tell me about it.

542
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,192
Nothing to tell.

543
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,430
Your boyfriend was whopping
that man's head...

544
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:07,319
...got in the car with him
and drove off.

545
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,755
Oh, God!

546
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,834
Okay, what eIse?
Do you remember anything eIse?

547
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,196
Yes, come to think of it, I do.

548
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,398
-Something odd.
-What?

549
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,916
In the middIe of everything...

550
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:26,033
...that Ieprechaun popped
off my Lucky Charms box...

551
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,515
...and started dancing around.

552
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,074
"Magically deIicious! "

553
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,959
Thank you.

554
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:40,675
If you wanna know the Iicense pIate
number of the car, Iet me know.

555
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,519
Wait, wait, wait.

556
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,517
It's very urgent. PIease!
I'll be one minute.

557
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,713
One minute. PIease? Thanks.

558
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:55,117
-Sir! Sir, my car was stoIen.
-Your car was stoIen?

559
01:06:55,320 --> 01:07:00,030
The Iicense pIate is 1 55INY.
I've aIready been to the poIice.

560
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,749
Mrs. Cousins? HeIene Cousins?

561
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,433
Yes... .

562
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,796
You may still have my oId address.

563
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,635
1 804 Northwest Everett Drive.

564
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,433
-SeattIe.
-New one. Thanks.

565
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,517
You gotta fill out this form.

566
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,350
I was having no success.

567
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,994
My methods needed to be rethought.

568
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,559
And then...

569
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,958
...my famiIy gave me a IittIe party
on my birthday.

570
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,552
Okay, move in.

571
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,749
Right, IittIe cIoser.

572
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,479
SmiIe!

573
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,831
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday, Barney.

574
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,951
BIow out the candIes, Daddy.

575
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,235
Thank you.

576
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,754
Forever.

577
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,234
More?

578
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:01,640
I'm afraid to open it.

579
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,433
Let's see.

580
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:08,351
What happened to me?

581
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:26,148
-What happened, Daddy?
-You fell off the baIcony.

582
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,595
BARNEY:
And that's when it dawned on me.

583
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:36,599
It wasn 't the lure that had
to be stronger. I had to be weaker.

584
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,954
Excuse me.

585
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:57,072
I've opened mine with a barrette
a million times.

586
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,748
-This way?
-Yes.

587
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,234
BIess you.

588
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,835
Excuse me. I have to go to
the men's room. I don't feeI so well.

589
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,070
I'd given up for the day.

590
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,872
It was comicaI.

591
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,992
I didn't trust myseIf
not to Iaugh the next time.

592
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,398
Fate, Jeff.

593
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,591
If I hadn 't sneezed....

594
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,990
-I'm sorry.
-Quite all right.

595
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,670
I was just wondering
if you had five singIes.

596
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,309
Three ones.

597
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,640
Just a normaI singIe you couId trade
me for my mangIed one. Thank you.

598
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,035
CouId you--?

599
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,635
Sorry.

600
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,395
Thank you.

601
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,758
Okay, now Iet's see if this works.

602
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,720
This is your Iucky day. I can feeI it.

603
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,794
Thank you.

604
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,318
That's a beautifuI braceIet.

605
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,717
Thank you. That's the symboI
for infinity.

606
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,438
I suppose it means it'll stay forever.

607
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,915
Well, it's a nice thought.

608
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:42,750
My boyfriend wouId really
appreciate something Iike that.

609
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,991
Where'd you get that?

610
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:49,079
I rep them.

611
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:53,276
I handIe saIes for the
whoIe Northwest Territory.

612
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,595
Wow!

613
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:59,316
If you promise not to tell
the next time you're in Paris...

614
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,078
...I'll Iet you have a sampIe
for cost.

615
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:06,153
-They're in my car.
-Really?

616
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,233
With a new product...

617
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,996
...it's a good idea to have peopIe
seen wearing it around town.

618
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,430
-Twenty-two bucks.
-That's cheap.

619
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:22,509
If I toId you the markup we get for
these, you'd die. You want one?

620
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,229
Yes.

621
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,113
Right this way.

622
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,319
There they are.

623
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,989
PIease.

624
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:58,397
They're called "tiIes" in French?

625
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:02,798
That's the name of the company. Teels.

626
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,994
Un tile infinity, pIease.

627
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,795
CouId you get in and give me a hand?

628
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,949
-Get in?
-Yes.

01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,470
Why did you make contact with me?

631
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,352
Because you asked.

632
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,952
The way you searched for Diane.

633
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,310
Such a worthy opponent.

634
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,511
A kindred spirit.

635
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:38,151
You don't meet many men who
refuse to give up or be dominated.

636
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,154
Most just crouch frightened
in the dark.

637
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,193
Excuse me.

638
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:53,832
I'm Iooking for Mr. Cousins.
I saw you come out of his house.

639
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,231
I know who you are.

640
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:00,995
You do?

641
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:05,631
Yeah, I saw him watching you
this afternoon...

642
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,512
...at the restaurant.

643
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,118
Come in out of the damp.

644
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,074
I'm Rita.

645
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,199
I'm Denise.

646
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,710
Are you going to run away together?

647
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:31,709
Um... .

648
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,909
It's compIicated.

649
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,833
Where is he now?

650
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,997
-At the cabin.
-The cabin? I forgot.

651
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,794
Don't you wanna be together forever?

652
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,189
That's the symboI for infinity.

653
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:02,473
I gave it to him on a braceIet
for his birthday.

654
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,551
Look, I wanna go to him now.

655
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:08,355
But I'm not sure I can find my way.
It's dark.

656
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,519
Can you tell me the way?

657
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,753
Come on. You can drop me off
on the way.

658
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:19,108
I'm meeting a boy. Daddy has no idea.

659
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:24,749
Mother's asIeep. Daddy says
romance has to be secret.

660
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,075
-You won't tell him, will you?
-No, I won't tell him.

661
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,430
JEFF:
I wanna know what you did with her.

662
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,039
I'll tell you.

663
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,551
I will keep my promise.

664
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,590
But there's onIy one way to do it.

665
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,072
You must experience
what she experienced.

666
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,274
What do you mean?

667
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:54,676
Everything that happened to her,
every event from this point on...

668
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,236
...you must dupIicate exactIy.

669
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,914
You're crazy.

670
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:02,192
If you do, Iogic dictates
you'll find her.

671
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,469
AIive?

672
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,110
This coffee is drugged.

673
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,190
Judging from your size...

674
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,472
...it wouId take 1 5 minutes
to take effect.

675
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,638
It'll put you out
for 40 minutes or so...

676
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,954
...the same Iength of time
Diane was out.

677
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,636
You must remain unconscious
for us to move on.

678
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,679
So she's not dead?

679
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,515
Drink.

680
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,198
And afterwards, what?

681
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,713
Drink and you will experience exactIy
what she experienced.

682
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:02,430
You don't understand. I won't tell
anyone. I just want to know.

683
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,232
I understand.

684
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:08,435
And when I put myseIf in your pIace,
I beIieve you.

685
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,551
That's why I don't need a gun.

686
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,829
Your obsession is my weapon.

687
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,634
It's Iike you are my Iaboratory rat.

688
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,877
I provided the materiaIs.
You've buiIt the cage.

689
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:26,069
OnIy now, you can't escape
what you've constructed.

690
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,317
If you want to know
what happened to her...

691
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,158
...you have to go through
the same things.

692
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:46,028
The key chain,
I'd Iike to see it again.

693
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:04,559
Jeff, Iook at your Iife.
You have nothing. No job.

694
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,039
No money.

695
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,159
No Iove.

696
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,351
No peace of mind.

697
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,429
It's been three years of hell.

698
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:24,475
At what point do you say,
"I'm not going to be over this"?

699
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,834
There were nights with Diane I'd pray
she'd get into an accident...

700
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:32,952
...just so she'd Iet me
take care of her.

701
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,799
Just so she'd have to stay with me.

702
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,429
You don't care
if she's aIive or dead.

703
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,675
I do.

704
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,873
You're afraid that
you won't know who you are.

705
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,510
Who is Jeff if he's not the guy
Iooking for Diane?

706
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,113
PIease.

707
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,471
Can you waIk away
from knowing the answer?

708
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:00,389
PIease, I just wanna know
what happened to her.

709
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,752
Drink, Jeff, really.
What choice do you have?

710
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,750
I said I'd show you
what happened to Diane...

711
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,355
...and I'm a man of my word.

712
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,757
No!

713
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,551
HeIp!

714
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,758
Diane.

715
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,589
Oh, shit!

716
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,993
Hello, Rita.

717
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,995
I really disIike surprises.

718
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,148
Rita?

719
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,675
It's me! Come out.

720
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,030
You can't possibIy win.

721
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,112
You don't know how.

722
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,110
Your hiding is pointIess.

723
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:32,153
I know these woods inside and out.

724
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,638
They're Iike a maze.

725
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,873
You must come out
if you want to find Jeff!

726
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,914
That's why you came, after all.

727
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:28,519
Where's Jeff?

728
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,189
Where?

729
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:35,314
Do what you want.
You'll never know what happened.

730
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,196
If anything happens to me, all
you'll have is your same uncertainty.

731
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:46,318
-Your choice.
-I'll take my chances.

732
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,952
Jeff?!

733
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:13,559
Jeff!

734
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,555
Jeff, are you here?

735
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,153
Jeff!

736
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,953
Jeff!

737
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,353
Jeff!

738
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:04,555
Hello?

739
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,759
Hello?

740
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:09,155
Hello?

741
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,995
Operator 3 1 9. What city, please?

742
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:20,557
Hello? Hello?

743
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,198
FeeIing strange?

744
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,237
This is silly, Rita.

745
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:58,993
You can't fight.

746
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,509
No!

747
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,598
BARNEY:
How did you follow us?

748
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,518
Did you see us Ieave?

749
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:00,593
The important thing is that
it was all Jeff's choice.

750
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:06,437
Coming to the restaurant,
getting in the car...

751
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,478
...drinking the coffee.

752
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,832
He did what he wanted to do.

753
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,795
You're feeIing better, aren't you?

754
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:24,516
I know how Iong
the chIoroform effects Iast.

755
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:27,109
You'll soon be strong enough to fight.

756
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:32,710
Well, I'm sorry, but...

757
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,711
...I'm just not up to it.

758
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:38,999
And besides...

759
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:43,154
...I have to get home before
my wife wakes up.

760
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,590
Tell me what you did to Jeff.

761
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,795
You took your chances.

762
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,039
Is he dead?

763
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,152
I made him a cup of coffee.
It was drugged.

764
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:09,070
To find out what happened,
he had to go through what she did.

765
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,196
And now you must do the same.

766
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:24,869
This can be easy,
or this can be hard.

767
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,992
Your choice.

768
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:36,110
Don't worry. It won't keep you up.

769
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:32,478
Tell me, Mr. Cousins. Have you spoken
to your daughter tonight?

770
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,951
What? How do you know my name?

771
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,795
I know your famiIy's names, Barney.
Wife, HeIene.

772
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,558
Daughter, Denise.

773
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:48,508
Sweet, innocent,
1 3-year-oId daughter, Denise.

774
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:52,356
Brown hair, full of secrets.

775
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:54,999
I've got her.

776
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:03,795
What are you up to?
How were you abIe to follow us?

777
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,752
Denise knows the way.

778
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:10,629
I took your daughter tonight
to trade for Jeff.

779
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:18,035
A brave attempt,
but we both know it's not true.

780
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:26,274
Let's taIk about the mistress
she wants you to have.

781
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:28,238
Wuthering Heights.

782
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:33,318
Or better yet,
Iet's taIk about infinity.

783
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,314
HeIene, it's me.

784
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,911
HELENE: Is Denise with you?
Her bed hasn 't been slept in.

785
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:26,908
I got up to close the windows
and she wasn 't there....

786
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,591
That's right, shithead.

787
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:37,477
Where is she?
What did you do with her?

788
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:43,232
If you wanna know, you'll have
to go through what she did.

789
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,638
-Drink.
-You can't be serious.

790
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,108
Try me.

791
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,359
-If you think--
-Drink!

792
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:54,869
Now!

793
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,913
To your heaIth.

794
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:38,674
Jeff! God, hoId on!

795
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,431
Jeff, hoId on! HoId on!

796
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,158
Jeff, hoId on!

797
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:36,278
Oh, Jesus!

798
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,068
God, be aIive! Be aIive.

799
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:43,634
Be aIive!

800
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:48,509
Rita?

801
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:55,199
I've got 1 5 minutes to find her, Rita!

802
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,670
-Son of a bitch!
-Where is she?

803
01:39:57,880 --> 01:40:00,758
-You killed him!
-I have no time to mess around!

804
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,475
-Get off of me! Bastard!
-Tell me where she is!

805
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,509
-Tell me where she is!
-No!

806
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:10,478
Where is she?

807
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,355
HeIp!

808
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,879
I've got 1 5 minutes to find her, Rita!

809
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,594
No, don't!

810
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,880
It's over. It's over.

811
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:30,832
You all right?

812
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:45,149
There was a terrific story
there before, but now...

813
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,874
...I think it's an out-and-out smash.

814
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,676
-I need for you to write it.
-I don't think so.

815
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:54,553
We wanna put the whoIe thing
behind us.

816
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:59,595
Look, I know I'm being gauche,
but I'm a pubIisher.

817
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:04,629
Write this book, pIease.
You won't regret it.

818
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:06,430
What do you say?

819
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,519
-No coffee.
-We don't drink that anymore.
