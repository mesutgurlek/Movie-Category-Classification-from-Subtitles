1
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,937
<i>kristin:
hey, meredith, it's kristin.</i>

2
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,137
<i>you have to tell me
what happened last night.</i>

3
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,137
<i>call me.</i>

4
00:03:19,337 --> 00:03:21,471
<i>brad:
hey, meredith. brad calling.</i>

5
00:03:21,504 --> 00:03:24,304
<i>listen, do you want
to hook up later?</i>

6
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,671
<i>well, i'll talk to you then.
give me a call. thanks.</i>

7
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,738
<i>brock: hey, meredith,
what's going on? this is brock.</i>

8
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,571
<i>i just wanted to let you know
the gang is gonna get together.</i>

9
00:03:37,604 --> 00:03:39,404
<i>we're gonna go to the garage.</i>

10
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:41,437
<i>we're gonna have some beers
and some shots.</i>

11
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,937
all right, dean,
this is the place.

12
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,937
i've got to say
dad and me did just fine

13
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,304
without these
stupid costumes.

14
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:22,638
i feel like
a high-school-drama dork.

15
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:26,471
what was that play
that you did?

16
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:28,304
what was it --
"our town"?

17
00:04:28,337 --> 00:04:29,970
yeah, you were good.
it was cute.

18
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,803
look, you want to
pull this off or not?

19
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:34,337
i'm just saying these outfits
cost hard-earned money.

20
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:35,437
whose?

21
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:38,803
ours. you think
credit-card fraud is easy?

22
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,037
thanks for letting us
look around.

23
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,571
the police said they were done
with the place, so...

24
00:04:57,204 --> 00:04:59,337
you guys said
you were with the alarm company?

25
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:00,704
that's right.

26
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:02,004
well, no offense,

27
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:05,170
but your alarm is about
as useful as boobs on a man.

28
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,170
well,
that's why we're here --

29
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:10,537
to see what went wrong,
to stop it from happening again.

30
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:14,371
now, ma'am,
you found the body?

31
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:15,537
yeah.

32
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:16,870
right after
it happened?

33
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:18,204
no, a few days later.

34
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:20,870
meredith's work called.
she hadn't showed up.

35
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,970
i knocked on her door.

36
00:05:23,004 --> 00:05:25,937
that's when i noticed...
the smell.

37
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,404
any windows open?
any sign of break-in?

38
00:05:29,437 --> 00:05:30,870
windows were locked.
front door was bolted.

39
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:33,271
chain was on the door.
we had to cut it to get in.

40
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:34,604
and the alarm was
still on?

41
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:37,604
like i said. bang-up job
your company is doing.

42
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,704
did you see
any overturned furniture,

43
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,371
broken glass,
signs of struggle?

44
00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:44,337
everything was
in perfect condition...

45
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:46,271
except meredith.

46
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,437
well, what condition
was meredith in?

47
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:52,837
meredith was all over,
in pieces.

48
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,704
the guy who killed her
must have been a whack job.

49
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:58,304
but i tell you,
if i didn't know any better,

50
00:05:58,337 --> 00:06:00,537
i'd have said
a wild animal did it.

51
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:06,170
ma'am, you mind
if we take some time,

52
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:08,271
give this place
a once-over?

53
00:06:08,304 --> 00:06:11,704
go right ahead.
knock yourself out.

54
00:06:17,104 --> 00:06:19,237
so the killer walks in and out
of the apartment --

55
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:20,738
no weapons, no prints,
nothing.

56
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,070
i'm telling you,
the minute i found that article,

57
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:24,738
i knew this
was our kind of gig.

58
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,271
i think
i agree with you.

59
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,770
so, you talked
to the cops?

60
00:06:28,803 --> 00:06:32,304
uh, yeah,
i spoke to amy --

61
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:36,304
a, uh, charming,
perky officer of the law.

62
00:06:36,337 --> 00:06:37,638
what did you find out?

63
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:40,638
well, she's a sagittarius.
she loves tequila.

64
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:42,837
i mean...whew.

65
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,004
oh, and she's got this
little tattoo. dean!

66
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,170
what? yeah.

67
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:48,004
nothing we don't
already know,

68
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:51,304
except for one thing they're
keeping out of the papers.

69
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:52,770
meredith's heart
was missing.

70
00:06:54,604 --> 00:06:55,738
her heart?

71
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,237
yeah, her heart.

72
00:06:58,271 --> 00:07:00,070
so, what do you think
did it to her?

73
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:02,471
the landlady said
it looked like an animal attack.

74
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:05,371
maybe it was.
werewolf?

75
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:07,271
not a werewolf.
the lunar cycle's not right.

76
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:08,337
if it was a creature,

77
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:10,137
it would've left
some kind of trace.

78
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,803
it was probably
a spirit.

79
00:07:13,837 --> 00:07:15,937
hmm.

80
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,471
see if you can find
any masking tape around.

81
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,371
ever see
that symbol before?

82
00:07:44,404 --> 00:07:46,837
never.

83
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,837
me, neither.

84
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:24,504
i talked
to the bartender.

85
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,937
did you get anything...
besides her number?

86
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,803
dude, i'm a professional.
i'm offended that...

87
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:35,037
all right.

88
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,237
you mind doing
a little bit of thinking

89
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:39,070
with your upstairs brain,
dean?

90
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:40,803
hmm? there's nothing
to find out.

91
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:42,837
meredith worked here.
she waited tables.

92
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,371
everyone here is her friend.
everyone says she's normal.

93
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:47,704
she didn't do or say anything
weird before she died.

94
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:49,970
what about that symbol?
did you find anything?

95
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:51,371
nope. nothing.

96
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:53,870
it wasn't in dad's journal
or in any of the usual books.

97
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:56,638
i just have to dig
a little deeper, i guess.

98
00:08:56,671 --> 00:09:00,037
there was a first victim, right,
before meredith?

99
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,037
right, yeah.
his name was, uh...

100
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,070
his name
was ben swardstrom.

101
00:09:04,104 --> 00:09:06,738
last month he was found
mutilated in his town house.

102
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,803
same deal. the door was locked.
the alarm was on.

103
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:11,738
is there any connection
between them?

104
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,070
nothing i could tell.

105
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:15,104
ben was a banker.
meredith was a waitress.

106
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,204
they never met,
never knew anyone in common.

107
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:19,571
they were practically
from different worlds.

108
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:21,404
so the only successful intel
we've scored

109
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:24,104
is the bartender's
phone number.

110
00:09:25,204 --> 00:09:27,404
what?

111
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,604
sam?

112
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,104
meg.

113
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:42,704
sam!

114
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,170
sam, is that you?
oh, my gosh!

115
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:55,970
[ sighs ]
what are you doing here?

116
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:57,937
i'm just in town --
visiting friends.

117
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,037
where are they?

118
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,371
well, they're not here
right now,

119
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:04,970
but what about you, meg?

120
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,838
i thought
you were going to california.

121
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,170
oh, i did.

122
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:10,371
i came. i saw.
i conquered.

123
00:10:10,404 --> 00:10:12,903
oh, and i met
what's his name --

124
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:15,404
something michael murray --
at a bar.

125
00:10:15,437 --> 00:10:16,571
who?

126
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:17,838
it doesn't matter.

127
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,237
anyway,
the whole scene got old,

128
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,537
so i'm living here
for a while.

129
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:25,070
you're from chicago?

130
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:28,070
no, massachusetts --
andover.

131
00:10:28,104 --> 00:10:29,637
gosh, sam,

132
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,838
what are the odds
we'd run into each other?

133
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,838
i know. i thought
i'd never see you again.

134
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,104
well,
i'm glad you were wrong.

135
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:41,537
dude, cover your mouth.

136
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:44,437
yeah, i'm sorry, meg.

137
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:47,671
this is, um --
this is my brother, dean.

138
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:50,903
this is dean?

139
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:52,704
yeah.
so you've heard of me?

140
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:54,537
oh, yeah,
i've heard of you.

141
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:58,337
nice -- the way you
treat your brother like luggage.

142
00:10:58,371 --> 00:10:59,671
sorry?

143
00:10:59,704 --> 00:11:02,270
why don't you
let him do what he wants to do?

144
00:11:02,304 --> 00:11:04,704
stop dragging him
over god's green earth.

145
00:11:04,738 --> 00:11:06,903
meg...it's all right.

146
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:12,371
[ whistles ]
okay. awkward.

147
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:15,437
[ chuckles ]
i'm gonna get a drink now.

148
00:11:20,003 --> 00:11:21,304
sam, i'm sorry.

149
00:11:21,337 --> 00:11:26,003
it's just, the way
you told me he treats you,

150
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:27,870
if it were me,
i'd kill him.

151
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:29,404
it's all right.
he means well.

152
00:11:29,437 --> 00:11:32,037
we should hook up
while you're in town.

153
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,204
yeah.

154
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:35,237
i could show you
a hell of a time.

155
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,537
that sounds great.

156
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,537
why don't you
give me your number?

157
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:41,870
312-555-0143.

158
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:43,738
you know what?
i never got your last name.

159
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:45,371
masters.
masters?

160
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,604
so you better call.

161
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:48,604
scout's honor.

162
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:52,637
i hope to
see you around, sam.

163
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:03,437
who the hell we he?

164
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:05,437
i don't really know.
i only met her once.

165
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:07,771
meeting up
with her again?

166
00:12:07,804 --> 00:12:11,104
i don't know, man.
it's weird.

167
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,771
what was she saying --
i treat you like luggage?

168
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:15,771
were you bitching about me
to some chick?

169
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:17,104
look, i'm sorry, dean.

170
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,604
it was when
we had that huge fight

171
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,637
when i was in the bus stop
in indiana.

172
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:22,637
is there any truth
to what she's saying?

173
00:12:22,671 --> 00:12:24,504
am i keeping you
against your will, sam?

174
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:26,437
no, of course not.
now, would you listen?

175
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:28,437
what?!

176
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:30,937
i think there's something
strange going on here, dean.

177
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,571
tell me about it.
she wasn't even into me.

178
00:12:32,604 --> 00:12:35,137
no, man, i mean,
like our kind of strange.

179
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,137
maybe even a lead.
why do you say that?

180
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,937
i met meg weeks ago literally
on the side of the road.

181
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,237
now i run into her
in some random chicago bar --

182
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,771
the same bar
where a waitress

183
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,838
was slaughtered
by something supernatural.

184
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,804
you don't think that's
weird? it happens.

185
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:49,870
well, yeah, it happens,
but not to us.

186
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,104
look, i could be wrong.

187
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,471
i'm just saying there's
something about this girl

188
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:55,137
that i can't
quite put my finger on.

189
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,804
but i bet you'd like to.

190
00:12:56,838 --> 00:12:58,504
but maybe
she's not a suspect.

191
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:00,437
maybe you got
a thing for her, huh?

192
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:03,771
you're thinking too much
with your upstairs brain, huh?

193
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:05,838
do me a favor.

194
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,037
check and see if there's
a meg masters from massachusetts

195
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,504
and see if you can't
dig anything up on that symbol.

196
00:13:11,537 --> 00:13:12,970
what are you gonna do?

197
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:14,771
i'm gonna watch meg.

198
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:16,204
[ laughs ] yeah.

199
00:13:16,237 --> 00:13:17,771
i just want to
see what's what.

200
00:13:17,804 --> 00:13:19,304
all right,
you little pervert.

201
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:21,337
i'm going. i'm going.

202
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:46,804
hey.

203
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:48,704
you're lurking outside
that poor girl's apartment,

204
00:13:48,738 --> 00:13:50,504
aren't you?
no.

205
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:53,838
yes.

206
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,970
you've got a funny way
of showing your affection.

207
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,671
you find anything
on her or what?

208
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,671
there's a meg masters
in the andover phone book.

209
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:02,704
i even pulled up
her high-school photo.

210
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:04,870
now, look, why don't you
go knock on her door

211
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:07,204
and invite her
to a poetry reading

212
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,704
or whatever it is
you do, huh?

213
00:14:09,738 --> 00:14:11,771
what about the symbol?
any luck?

214
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:14,070
yeah, that i did have
some luck with.

215
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:18,070
turns out
it's zoroastrian.

216
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:20,937
very, very old-school,
like 2,000 years before christ.

217
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,437
it's a sigil for a daeva.

218
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:23,903
what's a daeva?

219
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:25,903
it translates
to "demon of darkness" --

220
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:28,237
zoroastrian demons,
and they're savage, animalistic,

221
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,070
nasty attitudes --
kind of like demonic pit bulls.

222
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,270
how did you
figure that out?

223
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:36,404
you don't have a corner
on paper chasing around here.

224
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:37,870
name the last book
you read.

225
00:14:39,903 --> 00:14:42,371
i called dad's friend caleb.
he told me, all right.

226
00:14:42,404 --> 00:14:43,804
anyway,
here's the thing.

227
00:14:43,838 --> 00:14:46,070
these daevas,
they have to be summoned.

228
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:47,771
so someone's
controlling it?

229
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,270
yeah,
that's what i'm saying.

230
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:51,804
and from what i gather,
it's pretty risky business, too.

231
00:14:51,838 --> 00:14:54,237
these suckers tend to
bite the hand that feeds them...

232
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,771
and the arms
and the torsos.

233
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:57,970
what do they look like?

234
00:14:58,003 --> 00:15:00,137
nobody's seen them
for a couple of millennia.

235
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,771
summoning a demon
that ancient,

236
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:03,504
someone really
knows their stuff.

237
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,371
i think we've got
a major player in town.

238
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:09,471
why don't you go give that girl
a private strip-o-gram?

239
00:15:09,504 --> 00:15:11,270
<i>bite me.
bite her.</i>

240
00:15:11,304 --> 00:15:13,170
don't leave teeth marks,
though.

241
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,170
sam? are you --

242
00:15:44,337 --> 00:15:45,704
no, no, i'm just --

243
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:47,604
pervert!

244
00:15:47,637 --> 00:15:50,237
what a creep!

245
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,571
i don't think you should come

246
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:49,404
because the brothers --
they're in town.

247
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:51,104
i didn't know that --

248
00:18:56,237 --> 00:18:57,537
yes, sir.

249
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:03,037
yes, i'll be here...
waiting for you.

250
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:30,471
what the hell?

251
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:38,603
dude, i've got to
talk to you.

252
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:40,804
so, hot little meg
is summoning the daeva?

253
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:43,071
it looks like
she was using that black altar

254
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:44,404
to control the thing.

255
00:20:44,438 --> 00:20:46,737
so sammy's got a thing
for the bad girl.

256
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,704
and what's the deal
with that bowl again?

257
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:50,537
she was talking
into it --

258
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,670
the way witches used to scry
into crystal balls.

259
00:20:52,704 --> 00:20:54,304
she was communicating
with someone.

260
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,971
with the daeva? no, you said
those things were savages.

261
00:20:57,004 --> 00:20:59,271
no, this was
someone different,

262
00:20:59,304 --> 00:21:01,603
someone who's
giving her orders,

263
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:04,371
someone who's coming
to that warehouse.

264
00:21:13,371 --> 00:21:14,503
holy crap.

265
00:21:14,537 --> 00:21:15,971
what?

266
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:17,971
what i was gonna tell you
earlier.

267
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:20,470
i pulled a favor with my...
[ clears throat ]

268
00:21:20,503 --> 00:21:22,937
...friend amy
over at the police department.

269
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:25,503
complete records
of the two victims.

270
00:21:25,537 --> 00:21:27,237
we missed something
the first time.

271
00:21:27,271 --> 00:21:29,904
what?

272
00:21:29,937 --> 00:21:33,438
the first victim --
the old man?

273
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,804
he spent his whole life
in chicago,

274
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,570
but look where he was
born. lawrence, kansas.

275
00:21:38,603 --> 00:21:39,904
mm-hmm.

276
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:41,804
meredith --
the second victim?

277
00:21:41,837 --> 00:21:43,637
it turns out
she was adopted.

278
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,470
and guess
where she's from?

279
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:53,971
holy crap.

280
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:55,304
yeah.

281
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:57,570
i mean, that is
where the demon killed mom.

282
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:00,971
you think meg's tied up
with the demon?

283
00:22:01,004 --> 00:22:03,438
i think
it's a definite possibility.

284
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,971
what's the significance
of lawrence?

285
00:22:06,004 --> 00:22:07,637
and how do
these daeva things fit in?

286
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,971
i say we trash
that black altar, grab meg,

287
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:12,737
and have ourselves
a friendly little interrogation.

288
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,603
no, we can't.
we shouldn't tip her off.

289
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:16,737
we've got to stake out
that warehouse.

290
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,570
we've got to see who...or what
is showing up to meet her.

291
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:20,904
i'll tell you one thing.

292
00:22:20,937 --> 00:22:23,603
i don't think
we should do this alone.

293
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:27,470
we think
we've got a serious lead

294
00:22:27,503 --> 00:22:29,137
on the thing
that killed mom.

295
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:35,304
so, uh, this warehouse --
it's 1435 west erie.

296
00:22:35,338 --> 00:22:36,971
dad, if you get this,

297
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:39,837
get to chicago
as soon as you can.

298
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,503
voice mail?

299
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:42,837
yeah.

300
00:22:44,037 --> 00:22:45,503
jeez. what'd you get?

301
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:48,603
[ sighs ]
i ransacked that trunk --

302
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:51,104
holy water, y weapon
that i could think of.

303
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:54,537
exorcism rituals from about
a half-dozen religions.

304
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,637
i'm not sure
what to expect,

305
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:00,603
so i guess we should
just expect everything, huh?

306
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:11,338
it's a big night.

307
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:13,937
yeah.

308
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:15,237
you nervous?

309
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:18,770
no. no, are you?

310
00:23:18,804 --> 00:23:20,971
no. no way.

311
00:23:29,371 --> 00:23:31,171
god, could you imagine
if we actually

312
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:32,870
found that damn thing,
that demon?

313
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:34,971
let's not get
ahead of ourselves, all right?

314
00:23:35,004 --> 00:23:39,770
i know. i'm just saying...
what if we did?

315
00:23:39,804 --> 00:23:42,804
what if this whole thing
was over tonight?

316
00:23:42,837 --> 00:23:44,971
man,
i'd sleep for a month,

317
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:48,837
go back to school,
just be a person again.

318
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,904
you want to
go back to school?

319
00:23:50,937 --> 00:23:53,537
yeah, once we're done
hunting the thing.

320
00:23:54,704 --> 00:23:57,271
why? is there something wrong
with that?

321
00:23:57,304 --> 00:24:01,037
no, no, it's great.
good for you.

322
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:04,637
i mean, what are you gonna do
when it's all over?

323
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,770
it's never gonna
be over.

324
00:24:06,804 --> 00:24:08,071
there's gonna be others.

325
00:24:08,104 --> 00:24:10,371
there's always
gonna be something to hunt.

326
00:24:10,404 --> 00:24:13,204
but there's got to be something
that you want for yourself.

327
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:15,637
i don't want you to leave
the second this is over.

328
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:19,537
dude,
what's your problem?

329
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:28,503
why do you think
i drag you everywhere, huh?

330
00:24:28,537 --> 00:24:31,737
why do you think
i came and got you at stanford?

331
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,004
'cause dad was
in trouble.

332
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:36,670
'cause you wanted to
find the thing that killed mom.

333
00:24:36,704 --> 00:24:38,837
yes, that,
but it's more than that, man.

334
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:50,004
you and me and dad --

335
00:24:50,037 --> 00:24:53,404
i want us
to be together again.

336
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:59,670
i want us
to be a family again.

337
00:24:59,704 --> 00:25:04,371
<i>dean, we are a family.
i'd do anything for you.</i>

338
00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:07,404
but things will never
be the way they were before.

339
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:15,670
they could be.

340
00:25:19,371 --> 00:25:21,037
i don't want them
to be.

341
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:27,204
i'm not gonna
live this life forever.

342
00:25:27,237 --> 00:25:30,570
dean,
when this is all over,

343
00:25:30,603 --> 00:25:33,837
you're gonna have to let me
go my own way.

344
00:26:36,603 --> 00:26:40,870
guys. hiding is a little bit
childish, don't you think?

345
00:26:40,904 --> 00:26:42,870
that didn't work out
like i'd planned.

346
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:45,904
why don't you come out?

347
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:59,570
sam, i have to say,

348
00:26:59,603 --> 00:27:02,304
this puts a real crimp
in our relationship.

349
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:04,171
yeah,
tell me about it.

350
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:06,870
so, where's your
little daeva friend?

351
00:27:06,904 --> 00:27:08,104
around.

352
00:27:08,137 --> 00:27:10,770
and that shotgun's
not gonna do much good.

353
00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:12,704
oh, don't worry,
sweetheart.

354
00:27:12,737 --> 00:27:14,237
the shotgun's
not for the demon.

355
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:17,837
so, who is it, meg?
who's coming?

356
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,338
who are you waiting for?

357
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,870
you.

358
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:55,287
hey, sam,
don't take this the wrong way,

359
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:58,653
but your girlfriend...
is a bitch.

360
00:27:58,687 --> 00:28:02,854
this, the whole thing,
was a trap.

361
00:28:04,753 --> 00:28:07,387
running into you
at the bar,

362
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:11,121
following you here,
hearing what you had to say --

363
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:13,187
it was all a setup,
wasn't it?

364
00:28:14,787 --> 00:28:16,787
and that the victims were
from lawrence.

365
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,187
it doesn't
mean anything.

366
00:28:18,221 --> 00:28:20,820
it was just to draw you in,
that's all.

367
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:22,687
you killed those two people
for nothing.

368
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,987
baby, i've killed a lot more
for a lot less.

369
00:28:26,887 --> 00:28:30,020
you trapped us.
good for you.

370
00:28:30,054 --> 00:28:32,354
it's miller time.

371
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:34,187
why don't you kill us
already?

372
00:28:34,221 --> 00:28:37,321
not very quick on the uptake,
are we?

373
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,620
this trap isn't for you.

374
00:28:48,488 --> 00:28:49,653
dad.

375
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,254
it's a trap for dad.

376
00:28:55,121 --> 00:28:57,954
oh, sweetheart,
you're dumber than you look.

377
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:01,920
'cause even if dad was in town,
which he is not,

378
00:29:01,954 --> 00:29:03,920
he wouldn't walk
into something like this.

379
00:29:03,954 --> 00:29:05,653
he's too good.

380
00:29:05,687 --> 00:29:08,020
he is pretty good,
i'll give you that.

381
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,020
but you see...

382
00:29:20,354 --> 00:29:22,154
...he has one weakness.

383
00:29:22,187 --> 00:29:23,521
what's that?

384
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,287
you.

385
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:29,554
he lets his guard down
around his boys,

386
00:29:29,588 --> 00:29:32,954
lets his emotions
cloud his judgment.

387
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,720
<i>i happen to know
he is in town,</i>

388
00:29:37,753 --> 00:29:42,488
and he'll come
and try to save you.

389
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:45,387
and then the daevas
will kill everybody --

390
00:29:45,421 --> 00:29:49,987
nice and slow...
and messy.

391
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,321
well,
i've got news for you.

392
00:29:52,354 --> 00:29:55,653
it's gonna take a lot more
than some...shadow to kill him.

393
00:29:55,687 --> 00:29:57,854
oh, the daevas
are in the room here.

394
00:29:57,887 --> 00:29:59,087
they're invisible.

395
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:01,454
their shadows are
just the only part you can see.

396
00:30:01,488 --> 00:30:02,987
why are you
doing this, meg?

397
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,221
what kind of deal
you got worked out here, huh...

398
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:06,554
and with who?

399
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:08,488
i'm doing this
for the same reasons

400
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:10,488
you do what you do --

401
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:12,854
loyalty, love.

402
00:30:18,521 --> 00:30:20,488
like the love you had
for mommy...and jess.go to he

403
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:24,054
baby, i'm already there.

404
00:30:26,087 --> 00:30:28,221
[ sighs ]
come on, sam.

405
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:31,254
there's no need
to be nasty.

406
00:30:35,753 --> 00:30:39,720
i think we both know...

407
00:30:39,753 --> 00:30:42,588
how you really feel
about me.

408
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,687
you know...

409
00:30:49,753 --> 00:30:53,720
...i saw you...
watching me...

410
00:30:53,753 --> 00:30:57,287
changing
in my apartment.

411
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:59,887
it turned you on,
didn't it?

412
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,920
get a room, you two.

413
00:31:01,954 --> 00:31:03,454
i didn't mind.

414
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:06,121
i liked that
you were watching me.

415
00:31:06,154 --> 00:31:08,121
come on, sammy,

416
00:31:08,154 --> 00:31:11,121
you and i can still
have a little dirty fun.

417
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:13,753
you want to have fun?
go ahead, then.

418
00:31:13,787 --> 00:31:16,287
i'm a little tied up
right now.

419
00:31:51,488 --> 00:31:54,454
now, were you
just trying to distract me

420
00:31:54,488 --> 00:31:57,620
while your brother
cuts free?

421
00:31:57,653 --> 00:32:00,287
no.

422
00:32:00,321 --> 00:32:02,287
no.

423
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:05,187
it was because
i have a knife of my own.

424
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:09,187
sam!

425
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:11,054
get the altar.

426
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,354
[ chuckles ]
so, i guess the daevas

427
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,687
didn't like
being bossed around.

428
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,854
i guess not.

429
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,187
hey, sam?

430
00:32:58,221 --> 00:32:59,354
hmm?

431
00:32:59,388 --> 00:33:01,354
next time
you want to get laid,

432
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:05,054
find a girl that's
not so buckets of crazy, huh?

433
00:33:19,854 --> 00:33:22,254
why don't you just
leave that stuff in the car?

434
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:24,587
i said it before,
and i'll say it again --

435
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,787
better safe than sorry.

436
00:33:31,354 --> 00:33:32,520
hey!

437
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,021
dad.

438
00:33:47,054 --> 00:33:49,054
hey, boys.

439
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,553
hi, sam.

440
00:34:18,587 --> 00:34:19,921
hi, dad.

441
00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:25,754
dad, it was a trap.

442
00:34:25,787 --> 00:34:29,420
i didn't know.
i'm sorry.

443
00:34:29,453 --> 00:34:32,553
it's all right.
i thought it might have been.

444
00:34:32,587 --> 00:34:34,121
were you there?

445
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:38,487
i got there just in time to see
the girl take the swan dive.

446
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,887
she was the bad guy,
right?

447
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:41,420
yes, sir.yes, sir.

448
00:34:41,453 --> 00:34:43,921
good. well,
it doesn't surprise me.

449
00:34:43,954 --> 00:34:46,388
it's tried
to stop me before.

450
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:48,420
the demon has?

451
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,754
it knows i'm close.
it knows i'm gonna kill it.

452
00:34:51,787 --> 00:34:55,354
not just exorcise it
or send it back to hell,

453
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:58,154
actually kill it.

454
00:34:58,187 --> 00:34:59,754
how?

455
00:34:59,787 --> 00:35:02,854
i'm working on that.

456
00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:06,520
let us come with you.
we'll help.

457
00:35:06,553 --> 00:35:10,121
no, sam.

458
00:35:10,154 --> 00:35:11,187
not yet.

459
00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:13,453
listen,
try to understand.

460
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:15,921
this demon
is a scary son of a bitch.

461
00:35:15,954 --> 00:35:18,587
i don't want you
caught in the crossfire.

462
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,921
i don't want you hurt.

463
00:35:19,954 --> 00:35:22,087
you don't have to
worry about us.

464
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:23,121
of course i do.

465
00:35:25,453 --> 00:35:27,453
i'm your father.

466
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:35,787
listen, sammy,
the last time we were together,

467
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,620
we had one hell
of a fight.

468
00:35:37,654 --> 00:35:38,787
yes, sir.

469
00:35:46,654 --> 00:35:49,620
it's good
to see you again.

470
00:35:49,654 --> 00:35:51,487
it's been a long time.

471
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:55,221
too long.

472
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,221
no!

473
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:04,834
these things
are shadow demons,

474
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:06,567
so let's light 'em up!

475
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:22,667
dad!

476
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,901

dad's vulnerable
when he's with us.

493
