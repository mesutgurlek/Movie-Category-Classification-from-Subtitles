<i>Previously on "Hannibal"</i>

2
00:00:01,971 --> 00:00:05,437
Georgia Madchen was murdered
by whoever killed Dr. Sutcliffe.

3
00:00:05,557 --> 00:00:08,259
- Dad? It's for you.
- They know.

4
00:00:08,277 --> 00:00:11,479
He said he got so close to
Garret Jacob Hobbs

5
00:00:11,513 --> 00:00:14,115
- he was becoming him.
- My name is Will Graham.

6
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:16,284
- You think he's mentally ill?
- Whoever killed Marissa Schuur

7
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:18,697
and Cassie Boyle wanted to copy
how Hobbs killed his victims.

8
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:21,732
- Now he has Hobbs' daughter.
- Who Hobbs intended to kill.

9
00:00:21,852 --> 00:00:23,705
- Mind if I sit?
- Did Hannibal tell you?

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,592
- No, he didn't.
- How many people have you killed?

11
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:29,094
- Many more than your father.
- Are you gonna kill me?

12
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,923
(gunshot)

13
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,304
(moaning)

14
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:48,473
(catching his breath)

15
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,127
(dog barking)

16
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,146
- Oh!

17
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:01,520
(suspense music)

18
00:03:02,736 --> 00:03:05,054
(Vehicle approaching)

19
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,141
I went to Minnesota.

20
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:29,829
I took Abigail.

21
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,001
We went to Minnesota and...

22
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:41,090
She didn't come back with me.

23
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,546
Show me.

24
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:08,818
I don't remember
going to bed last night.

25
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,787
But...

26
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:13,289
I must have.

27
00:04:13,323 --> 00:04:16,608
I- I don't know, maybe I

28
00:04:16,626 --> 00:04:20,612
got up to let the dogs out,
and, and, and then...

29
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,166
- When was the last time you saw Abigail?
- I woke up, my feet were muddy.

30
00:04:24,217 --> 00:04:27,136
Will. When was the last time
you saw Abigail?

31
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,171
Yesterday.

32
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:32,842
At her father's cabin.

33
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:36,812
I had...

34
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:38,848
an episode.

35
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,320
Uh, she said something
was wrong with me.

36
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:47,323
She was afraid of me.

37
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:52,311
And she ran away.

38
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:54,296
What happened?

39
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:56,699
Why was she afraid?

40
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,835
I hallucinated
that I killed her.

41
00:05:02,172 --> 00:05:04,790
But it wasn't real.

42
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,595
I know it wasn't real.

43
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:28,147
Will, we have to call Jack.

44
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,350
You can't run from this.

45
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:33,886
It'll only be worse.

46
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,741
Get dressed.

47
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:47,333

What are we gonna find
in Minnesota, Will?

51
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:27,116
I don't know.

52
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:34,380
Go ahead and process him.

Right front pocket.

60

One folding knife.
Right front pocket.

61
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:53,293
Folding knife.

62
00:08:03,454 --> 00:08:06,606
I can't do the
silent treatment.

63
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,109
I can't pretend I don't know
you and I can't pretend

64
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:11,895
we both don't know what
I'm finding under your nails.

65
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:18,952
You called me once because you didn't
trust yourself to know what was real.

66
00:08:18,986 --> 00:08:22,572
- This blood is real, Will.
- I know.

67
00:08:22,623 --> 00:08:24,624
Do you know how it got there?

68
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,965
Not with any certainty, no.

69
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,235
Certainty comes
from the evidence.

70
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:37,570
I didn't want to find
any evidence on you.

71
00:08:37,605 --> 00:08:39,806
I wanted to be certain
about who you are,

72
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,758
but you can't even be
certain with yourself.

73
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,543
Not anymore.

74
00:08:43,561 --> 00:08:46,712
If you weren't certain with yourself,
you shouldn't have been here.

75
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,799
This is the FBI.

76
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:54,637
I thought I would get better.

77
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:59,909
You always said you interpret
the evidence, so do it, Will.

78
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:04,864
Interpret the evidence.

79
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:10,954
According to the evidence...

80
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:18,545
I killed Abigail Hobbs.

81
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:25,018
We analyzed the tissue.

82
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:27,187
It matched Abigail Hobbs.

83
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:29,022
It was her ear,

84
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:31,524
her blood under
Will's fingernails.

85
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,527
Scratches on his arms
are all defensive wounds,

86
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:36,696
like she fought back.

87
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,698
Shut up.

88
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:41,501
- I-
- stop talking.

89
00:09:44,171 --> 00:09:46,272
"He won't get too close."

90
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,775
You said you would cover him.

91
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:52,295
- You could see he was breaking.
- Yes, I could.

92
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,297
And I kept pushing him

93
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:56,733
because he was
saving lives, Alana.

94
00:09:58,252 --> 00:10:00,803
Not Abigail Hobbs' life.

95
00:10:00,838 --> 00:10:03,473
You look me in
the face and tell me

96
00:10:03,507 --> 00:10:05,808
that you couldn't see
that he was breaking?

97
00:10:05,843 --> 00:10:08,478
Of course, I could see it.

98
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:10,647
I told you not to
put him out there!

99
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:12,982
Every decision I made
concerning Will's mental health

100
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:16,069
I made under advisement
of a respected psychiatrist,

101
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:17,554
who you recommended.

102
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:20,973
Hannibal had to know. He had
to see something was wrong.

103
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:22,475
Not until it was too late.

104
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:24,977
Just like everybody else.

105
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:27,813
(Sighing)

106
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:29,866
Hannibal said that Will was

107
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:31,868
exhibiting signs of dementia.

108
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,320
Dementia isn't a disease.

109
00:10:34,338 --> 00:10:36,489
It's a symptom of disease!

110
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:40,093
We have to find out what's
causing it and treat it!

111
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:43,496
The concern is that there
may not be anything to treat.

112
00:10:43,514 --> 00:10:45,682
Will had a brain scan.

113
00:10:45,716 --> 00:10:48,351
They found nothing.

114
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:51,888
Well then, they don't know
what they're looking for.

115
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:56,842
This started with
Garret Jacob Hobbs.

116
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,862
Maybe Will just did
what Hobbs couldn't.

117
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,220
He killed his daughter.

118
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:10,823
Abigail's blood
is on all of us.

119
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:15,545
And so is Will's.

120
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:29,509
(Silent screams)

121
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:04,494
Hi.

122
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:07,447
Hi.

123
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:11,200
You're flushed.
You been yelling?

124
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:16,612
- Screaming is more like it.
- I could use a good scream.

125
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:22,078
I can feel one
perched under my chin.

126
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:26,160
- Let it out.
- I'm afraid that if I started...

127
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:29,769
I wouldn't be able to stop.

128
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:32,705
I'm surprised Jack
let you in here,

129
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,208
given my romantic overtures.

130
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:39,846
Jack doesn't know about
your romantic overtures.

131
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:43,232
Didn't know.

132
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:55,511
(Whispering): I guess you
dodged a bullet with me.

133
00:12:57,031 --> 00:13:00,550
I don't feel like
I dodged a bullet.

134
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:06,055
I feel wounded.

135
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,297
I've been in touch with,

136
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:16,582
um, animal services.

137
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:20,069
I'll go pick up your dogs
in a couple hours.

138
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:25,892
I'll take them back
home with me... (Sniffling)

139
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:28,094
and I'll take care
of them until...

140
00:13:30,414 --> 00:13:31,881
whenever.

141
00:13:31,915 --> 00:13:35,167
Whenever could be
a long time from now.

142
00:13:35,185 --> 00:13:38,855
I'll take care of them
until then.

143
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:41,808
Thank you.

144
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:49,031
We have to do some tests.

145
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:52,368
They'll be the standard
psychopathology tests.

146
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:55,621
I suppose you're gonna ask me to
draw a clock while you're at it.

147
00:13:57,107 --> 00:13:59,575
Did Hannibal
ask you to draw a clock?

148
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:03,079
Said it was an exercise...

149
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:07,250
to ground me
in the present moment.

150
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:12,455
A handle to help me
hold on to reality.

151
00:14:13,974 --> 00:14:15,908
Was the clock normal?

152
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:18,895
Would I be here if it wasn't?

153
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:27,487
Draw me a clock.

154
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:49,842
You see?
It's just a normal clock.

155
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:56,432
Telling the time
isn't my problem.

156
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,938
(Sighing)

157
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:07,360
It's the least of
your problems.

158
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,404
Seems hard
to find words today.

159
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:30,712
(Sighing)

160
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:33,047
Despite the
overwhelming evidence,

161
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:35,717
I find myself searching
for ways

162
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:38,136
that Abigail
could still be alive.

163
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,472
Grieving is an
individual process

164
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,274
with a universal goal:

165
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,277
the truest examination
of the meaning of life

166
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,313
and the meaning of its end.

167
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,648
I know what life means.

168
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,718
We've existed for
a hundred thousand years.

169
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,737
In that time,

170
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:58,072
a hundred billion human lives

171
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:00,308
have had beginnings and ends.

172
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:03,962
A hundred billion lives
haven't impacted yours,

173
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:07,315
but clearly
Abigail Hobbs' life has,

174
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:09,834
and you seem
surprised by that.

175
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,841
I never considered
having a child.

176
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:23,531
But after meeting Abigail,
I understood the appeal.

177
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,170
The opportunity to
guide and support,

178
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,906
and in many ways,
direct a life.

179
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:35,226
You were having
influence on her?

180
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,146
I was hoping I was.

181
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:42,867
Young people are
supposed to be the lenses

182
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,220
through which we see ourselves
living beyond this life.

183
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,574
I think of my earliest memory

184
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:53,594
and project forward to what
I imagine will be my death.

185
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:57,632
I never think about living
beyond that span of time.

186
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,386
Except by reputation.

187
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,655
Even after this loss?

188
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:08,126
More so after this loss.

189
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,312
Will Graham is a loss, too.

190
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:14,198
You might grieve him
as a loss.

191
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,217
I haven't given up on Will.

192
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:19,220
If they do find him guilty

193
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,722
of killing Abigail Hobbs...

194
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:22,223
When.

195
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:24,926
Let's be honest.

196
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,578
I don't recommend

197
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,182
you participate in any
rehabilitation effort.

198
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:39,023
I was so confident in
my ability to help him...

199
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,460
To solve him.

200
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:44,679
To save him.

201
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:51,636
Saving him,

202
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,821
I lost Abigail.

203
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:58,443
It's hard to accept
that I could fail them both

204
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,478
so profoundly.

205
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,379
- Okay Jimmy, what have you got?
- Um, as you know,

206
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:20,965
Will is a big fly fisherman,
and he designs

207
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,334
all of his own lures.

208
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:25,119
Most anglers use feathers, fur,

209
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,171
twine, bits of shell.

210
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:30,141
They design each lure
to catch a specific fish.

211
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,809
This one caught my eye.

212
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:35,796
I noticed the hair color. Took me a
few to accept what I was seeing.

213
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,966
- I ran a chem-set to confirm the connection.
- What connection?

214
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:42,970
Four of the lures are made from
materials including human remains.

215
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,339
And we have a DNA match
for all of them.

216
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,191
This one is Cassie Boyle.

217
00:18:47,242 --> 00:18:50,495
Bits of bone fragments
and pieces of lung.

218
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,247
Marissa Schuur. Antler velvet,

219
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:55,333
a fingernail,
wound with her hair.

220
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,834
Doctor Sutcliffe.

221
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,520
Crushed teeth, soft tissue
from inside his mouth,

222
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,324
bound with cartilage from his jaw.
All victims of the copycat?

223
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,160
And this last lure
was made with hair and fiber

224
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:10,047
- that matches Georgia Madchen.
- He took trophies of all his victims.

225
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:13,601
Trophies. So now Will Graham's a
serial killer who takes trophies?

226
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:16,604
Something's wrong with Will
physically, neurologically.

227
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:18,473
He's not a serial killer.

228
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,149
(Sound of a horse trotting)

229
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:42,296
(Suspense music)

230
00:19:55,055 --> 00:19:57,132
<i>You're sick, Will.</i>

231
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,900
I - I wasn't consistent with

232
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:05,269
taking my antibiotics.

233
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:07,271
The fever came back.

234
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:10,107
We're gonna move you to
a secure medical ward.

235
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,493
We're gonna get to the bottom
of whatever it is that's wrong

236
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:14,996
with you and we're
gonna make sure

237
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,665
that you get whatever kind of
treatment you need.

238
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:19,367
And then what?

239
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:23,871
Baltimore State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane?

240
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,593
Have Chilton fumbling
around in my head?

241
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,345
This job doesn't generally
lend itself to optimism,

242
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,847
all right?

243
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:35,166
But I desperately
want to be optimistic

244
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,187
about an alternative to what every fiber
of the evidence is telling me you've done.

245
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:42,240
I can't confess to something
I don't remember.

246
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,242
The question is,

247
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,511
how much more is there
that you don't remember?

248
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,716
We found your fishing lures.

249
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:55,369
Yeah, I should hope so.

250
00:20:55,404 --> 00:20:58,472
They-they were on my desk
right by the front door.

251
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,625
We found human remains

252
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:04,462
amongst the materials
that you made them from.

253
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,298
The human remains of
Cassie Boyle, Marissa Schuur,

254
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:11,335
Donald Sutcliffe,
Georgia Madchen.

255
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,626
(Whispering): No.

256
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,478
Yes.

257
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,513
(Whispering): I wasn't...

258
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,969
I wasn't sick when
Cassie Boyle was murdered.

259
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:31,622
I wasn't sick when Marissa
Schuur was murdered.

260
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,342
That's not an argument
you want to be making right now.

261
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,361
Not with me.

262
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,551
Because then,
I'd be a psychopath.

263
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:47,038
My biggest fear
is that we'll learn

264
00:21:47,089 --> 00:21:50,041
that you knew what
you were doing the whole time.

265
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,693
Hey, you don't have to be
afraid of that, Jack.

266
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,685
There is something
you should be afraid of, though.

267
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:04,272
- Yeah? What's that?
- Whoever's doing this to me.

268
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:07,658
Someone's doing this to you?

269
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,061
They'll be close to you.

270
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:12,229
It could be someone here.

271
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:14,732
Working with you.

272
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:16,850
So that's it? It's a setup?

273
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,369
They know the cases.

274
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,039
They know forensics.

275
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,211
They know that I'm unstable.

276
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:30,314
Can you hear how
paranoid you sound?

277
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:35,336
Or it could just be you.

278
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,307
Then I'd be really
screwed, wouldn't I?

279
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:49,517
I wanted to be
the one to do this.

280
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,606
Will Graham,
you're under arrest for murder.

281
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,492
You have the right
to remain silent.

282
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,697
♪

283
00:23:53,938 --> 00:23:55,453
Jack: He disarmed his guard.

284
00:23:55,573 --> 00:23:57,900
He threw the guard and the
driver from the vehicle.

285
00:23:57,935 --> 00:24:00,653
We found the ambulance
in an alley in Dumfries.

286
00:24:00,687 --> 00:24:04,707
These are not the actions
of an innocent man.

287
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:07,476
They're the actions of
a man who's impaired.

288
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:10,530
I had Will draw a clock to test
for cognitive dysfunction.

289
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,368
That is extreme.

290
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:22,125
Now this is the clock
he drew for me two weeks ago.

291
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:27,430
It's normal.

292
00:24:30,184 --> 00:24:32,301
What disease
progresses gradually

293
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:34,437
but plateaus for
lengths of time?

294
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:37,106
Will has periods of clarity.

295
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:39,525
We've seen him
lucid and aware one moment

296
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,027
and then the next he's not.

297
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:45,014
Could be some form
of encephalitis.

298
00:24:45,032 --> 00:24:48,117
- Autoimmune encephalitis?
- It's hard to diagnose.

299
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:50,203
There are no tumors,
no lesions.

300
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:52,772
It wouldn't even show up on a brain
scan unless you were looking for it.

301
00:24:52,806 --> 00:24:55,625
Look, just tell me if he could kill
five people and not be aware of it.

302
00:24:57,761 --> 00:25:00,696
This doesn't feel
like dementia.

303
00:25:00,714 --> 00:25:03,199
This is an
intelligent psychopath.

304
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:05,234
Look, this killer

305
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:09,205
called the Hobbs' house,
he warned Abigail's father.

306
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:11,390
I was with Will
that entire time.

307
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:13,593
Did he have an opportunity
to make a phone call?

308
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:17,546
Before we went to interview Garret Jacob
Hobbs, he was alone in the office while

309
00:25:17,564 --> 00:25:21,567
I was outside loading the car with the
files, but that was only for a few minutes.

310
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:25,721
Dumb luck and bad bookkeeping.

311
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:28,224
That's how Will said
he caught Hobbs.

312
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:30,243
Now how would you
say he caught him?

313
00:25:32,246 --> 00:25:34,897
We were looking
through the files

314
00:25:34,915 --> 00:25:38,084
and it was as if
Will plucked his name

315
00:25:38,118 --> 00:25:41,570
out of a hat, based on little
more than an incomplete address.

316
00:25:41,588 --> 00:25:44,257
Let me play the devil here
for a moment, doctor.

317
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:48,277
This clock test, could Will
fake something like this?

318
00:25:48,312 --> 00:25:50,763
Would he be able to do that?

319
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:56,152
Yes.

320
00:26:16,189 --> 00:26:17,857
Hello, Will.

321
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:21,344
How are you feeling?

322
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:23,562
Selfaware.

323
00:26:25,365 --> 00:26:27,283
You frightened Alana Bloom.

324
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:29,802
She's confused about
who I am...

325
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:33,923
Which I can relate to.

326
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:37,977
Are you confused
about who I am?

327
00:26:38,011 --> 00:26:40,680
I'm not confused.
I'm skeptical.

328
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:45,151
Meaning I'm willing to change my
mind should the evidence change.

329
00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:48,004
Do you believe
I killed Abigail?

330
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:51,173
I believe it's
entirely possible,

331
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:54,160
if not nearly indisputable,

332
00:26:54,194 --> 00:26:56,829
based on how you
discovered her ear.

333
00:26:56,863 --> 00:26:58,831
If it was just Abigail,

334
00:26:58,865 --> 00:27:01,200
I would have believed.

335
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:07,840
I would have believed
that I got so far

336
00:27:07,874 --> 00:27:10,543
inside Hobbs' head
I couldn't get out.

337
00:27:10,594 --> 00:27:13,596
But it wasn't just Abigail.

338
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,334
I know who I am.

339
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:20,236
No.

340
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,856
All sense of who you are has
been distorted by your illness.

341
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,508
You know who you are
in this moment.

342
00:27:27,995 --> 00:27:30,229
That's not always
the case, Will.

343
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,115
I didn't kill any of 'em.

344
00:27:36,236 --> 00:27:37,703
And somebody

345
00:27:37,738 --> 00:27:40,373
is making sure

346
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:42,591
that no one believes me.

347
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:47,046
If we're to prove you
didn't commit these murders,

348
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,082
perhaps we should consider
how you could have.

349
00:27:52,252 --> 00:27:54,553
And then disprove that.

350
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:57,723
<i>If you are this killer,</i>

351
00:27:57,758 --> 00:28:01,227
that identity runs
through these events

352
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:03,229
like a thread through pearls.

353
00:28:03,263 --> 00:28:06,565
Cassie Boyle would have been
your first victim.

354
00:28:08,402 --> 00:28:11,404
You said her crime scene was
practically gift-wrapped.

355
00:28:19,196 --> 00:28:21,864
(Suspense music)

356
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:26,118
It told me everything
I needed to know

357
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:28,120
to catch Garret Jacob Hobbs.

358
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:31,123
You had seen one of Hobbs'
victims. You knew how he killed.

359
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:34,276
You may have been
exploring how he killed

360
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:37,263
to better understand
who he was.

361
00:28:37,297 --> 00:28:40,599
I wasn't in Minnesota when
Cassie Boyle was murdered.

362
00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:44,603
She disappeared on a Saturday.
She was found on a Monday.

363
00:28:44,638 --> 00:28:47,473
You would've had the weekend

364
00:28:47,507 --> 00:28:49,475
to do your work.

365
00:28:49,526 --> 00:28:52,194
(Whispering): I know
I didn't kill her.

366
00:28:52,229 --> 00:28:54,029
How do you know?

367
00:28:54,064 --> 00:28:57,533
What did you think when
you first met Marissa Schuur?

368
00:28:57,567 --> 00:29:00,703
How much like Abigail she was?

369
00:29:00,737 --> 00:29:03,539
Same height, same weight,

370
00:29:03,573 --> 00:29:06,775
hair color, same age.

371
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:10,379
- How could I resist?
- So much like his daughter.

372
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:14,116
You may have wondered why Garret
Jacob Hobbs didn't kill her himself.

373
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:16,836
Dr. Sutcliffe wasn't killed

374
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:19,054
how Garret Jacob Hobbs killed.

375
00:29:21,224 --> 00:29:24,009
<i>He was murdered how</i>
<i>you imagined yourself</i>

376
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,896
<i>murdering a woman</i>
<i>only days before.</i>

377
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:30,850
How Georgia Madchen killed.

378
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:33,486
She dreamt she saw me
killing Sutcliffe.

379
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,239
But she couldn't see my face.
And then she was murdered.

380
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:41,076
You catch these killers
by getting into their heads,

381
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:43,195
but you also allow them

382
00:29:43,246 --> 00:29:45,981
into your own.

383
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:49,034
I'm trying to help you, Will.

384
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:55,191
Then take me to Minnesota.

385
00:29:57,444 --> 00:30:00,262
I want to see
where Abigail died.

386
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,245
Have you had any contact with Hannibal
Lecter in the last 24 hours?

387
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:32,246
He didn't make his session
this morning and he didn't

388
00:30:32,281 --> 00:30:34,699
call in, which he
would consider rude.

389
00:30:34,717 --> 00:30:37,018
- Is something wrong?
- I'm on my way to Minnesota.

390
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:40,555
I believe that Will Graham has taken
Hannibal Lecter to Minnesota.

391
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,925
Will thinks he's being framed
for these murders.

392
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:44,890
He's slipping in and out
of delusion.

393
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,879
He could kill Hannibal
and not even know he's doing it.

394
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:51,733
If anyone could've helped Mr. Graham,
it would've been Hannibal.

395
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:57,271
In fact, he may still be trying.

Until she found out
some of yours?

460
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:50,865
You said it felt good
to kill Garret Jacob Hobbs.

461
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:54,018
Would it feel good
to kill me now?

00:35:54,036 --> 00:35:56,186
Oh, Garret Jacob Hobbs

Are you a murderer,

What reason would I have?

00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:15,139
You, you have
no traceable motive...

466

Which is why you were
so hard to see.

467
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:24,265
You were just...

468

curious what I would do.

469
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,405
Someone like me.

how I think.

00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,195
Wind him up...

472
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,500

473
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,919
And apparently,

474
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,088
Dr. Lecter...

475
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,290
this is how I go.

476
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:51,008

antiviral and steroid therapies.

More or less.

485
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:48,084
He's expected to make

00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,053
a substantial recovery.

487
00:37:50,087 --> 00:37:53,773
Would you have gone
to Minnesota with him

488
00:37:53,825 --> 00:37:55,775
if he didn't have
a gun on you?

489
00:37:55,827 --> 00:37:58,111
(Monitor beeping)

490
00:37:58,146 --> 00:38:01,081
I would have wanted to.

491
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:10,406
I believe I've failed to satisfy
my obligation to Will,

492
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:12,459
more than I care to admit.

493
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:16,179
Well he's not
your victim, doctor.

494
00:38:16,214 --> 00:38:19,266
Nor is he yours.

495
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:24,421
You know, in my time I've seen
people broken by the world.

496
00:38:24,455 --> 00:38:28,091
I've seen them broken
in all kinds of hideous

497
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:30,310
and offhanded ways,
but never like this.

498
00:38:32,113 --> 00:38:34,030
Never like this.

499
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,771
No one in this room
will be the same.

500
00:38:41,806 --> 00:38:43,957
(Monitor beeping)

501
00:38:52,466 --> 00:38:56,002
- Good evening.
- Hello, Hannibal.

502
00:38:56,053 --> 00:38:58,321
Please come in.

503
00:38:58,356 --> 00:39:01,291
<i>Tête de veau en sauce verte.</i>

504
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:03,343
Smells like a bonfire.

505
00:39:03,394 --> 00:39:06,513
I smoked the veal
on a pyre of dry hay.

506
00:39:06,564 --> 00:39:08,515
It imparts a unique

507
00:39:08,566 --> 00:39:11,151
smoldering flavor to the meat

508
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:13,486
and to the room.

509
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:16,573
This is an unexpected treat.

510
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,978
Thank you for indulging me.

511
00:39:22,013 --> 00:39:25,081
You seemed like
you needed to talk.

512
00:39:25,116 --> 00:39:27,767
And since you refuse
invitations to my dinner table,

513
00:39:27,887 --> 00:39:29,979
this is the only way
I could cook for you.

514
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:32,839
What's on your mind, Hannibal?

515
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,183
I'm going to see
Will tomorrow.

516
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:45,435
As a patient

517
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:47,437
or as a friend?

518
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,889
As a farewell.

519
00:39:49,941 --> 00:39:51,725
Of sorts.

520
00:39:51,776 --> 00:39:55,729
I thought Mr. Graham
was finally going to be

521
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:58,098
the patient who
cost you your life.

522
00:39:58,132 --> 00:40:00,233
He didn't cost me my life.

523
00:40:00,284 --> 00:40:03,787
He cost Abigail hers.

524
00:40:03,821 --> 00:40:06,289
Your veal is getting cold.

525
00:40:06,324 --> 00:40:08,875
Controversial dish.

526
00:40:08,909 --> 00:40:10,577
Veal.

527
00:40:18,419 --> 00:40:20,337
Mmm.

528
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:25,976
Those who denounce veal
often cite the young age

529
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,478
at which the animals are killed,
when they are in fact

530
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:30,814
older than many pigs
going to slaughter.

531
00:40:32,316 --> 00:40:35,101
You have to be
careful, Hannibal.

532
00:40:35,152 --> 00:40:38,905
They're starting
to see your pattern.

533
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:42,575
What pattern would that be?

534
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,095
You develop relationships

535
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:48,248
with patients who
are prone to violence.

536
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:51,785
That pattern.

537
00:40:51,836 --> 00:40:54,404
Under scrutiny,

538
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:56,723
Jack Crawford's
beliefs about you

539
00:40:56,757 --> 00:40:59,259
might start to unravel.

540
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:02,762
Tell me, Dr. du Maurier...

541
00:41:04,281 --> 00:41:07,901
Have your beliefs
about me begun to unravel?

542
00:41:07,935 --> 00:41:10,804
(Soft opera song)

543
00:41:48,142 --> 00:41:49,809
Hello, Will.

544
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:12,782
Hello, Dr. Lecter.

545
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:20,093
