00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,551
Oh, Miss Keller...

330
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,712
- About my story. I...
- Not now.

331
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,550
Now, listen, sweetie.
Last night I found a tape.

332
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,517
It was one of hers.

333
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,751
And I made it so we'd never
have to see it again.

334
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,751
But if she knows that,

335
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,150
what I did might
make her wanna hurt us.

336
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,791
Am I right?
Do you know something, honey?

337
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,792
Look, if you know why she's here,
you have to tell me.

338
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,314
Aidan...

339
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,039
...is she here to hurt you?

340
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,636
Honey.

341
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,918
[Whispering] She can hear us.

342
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,996
She hears everything.

343
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,711
Except when we sleep.

344
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,916
She can't hear us
when we sleep?

345
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,678
What does that mean?

346
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,069
We have to sleep.

347
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,116
[Knocking]

348
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,237
[Max] Rachel,
may I come in, please?

349
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,072
Yeah.

350
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,030
What happened to your car?

351
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,997
Your car. Apparently it's wrecked.

352
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,550
- Are you guys OK?
- Yeah. We got hit.

353
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,756
[Max] And no one's hurt?

354
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,400
That's good.

355
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,029
Aidan, right? Hi, I'm Max.

356
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,433
- Is he all right?
- He's sick.

357
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,317
How sick?

358
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,278
Max,

359
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,237
I need your help.

360
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,993
Here.

361
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,036
I'll get some more blankets.

362
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,953
The house is yours if there's
anything you need at all.

363
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,156
[Rachel] OK. Thanks.

364
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,878
- Here.
- Thank you.

365
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,758
- Shouldn't he be at a hospital?
- No, he's fine.

366
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,034
The bath?

367
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,714
Just down the hall.
I'll get it started.

368
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,518
Honey.

369
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,549
I'm gonna go home
and get some of our things.

370
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,318
Then we'll leave here
and never come back, OK?

371
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,912
[Rachel] Let's get you warmed up.

372
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,594
Not the best water pressure,
but it works.

373
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,319
It's good, thanks.
I don't know why we lost power.

374
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,594
The block seemed fine.

375
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,558
I have plenty of candles
in case the problem spreads.

376
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,596
Go ahead and get in.
Get you warmed up.

377
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,114
Max, I just need
to go back to my house,

378
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,316
get a few things,
some medicine.

379
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,197
Do you mind if you could?

380
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,589
- I'll watch him. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

381
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,399
Honey, go ahead and get in.
Let's go. Let's go.

382
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,798
We need to raise your temperature.
Now, let's get in.

383
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,917
Aidan, what's wrong?
It's just water.

384
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,356
- We need to raise your temperature...
- I don't want to, Rachel.

385
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,715
Do you want me
to get in with you?

386
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,475
Let's go then.
Aidan. Come on, let's go.

387
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,157
That's it.

388
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,118
Come on, honey.
Let's go. Let's go.

389
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,395
That's it. That's it.

390
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,351
That's better, right?

391
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,069
See? It's nice and warm.

392
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,550
It's OK. Just relax.

[Max] Hello?

397
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,636
Officer Ray. How you doing?

398
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,156
Yeah, good, good. All right,
what do you got for me?

399
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,993
Mm-hmm. Right.

400
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,196
Yeah. Yeah.

401
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,352
Yeah, well, that all
sounds like page 26.

402
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,510
You don't have any headlines?

403
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,397
No?

404
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,710
Well, business is business.

405
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,031
Yeah. No, no, I'm good.
Real good.

406
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,714
Could you do me a little favour
while I've got you?

407
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,075
Could you look into
your accident reports

408
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,197
and see if there was an accident
with a woman and her son?

"K" for Keller.

No, no, I'm just trying
to get a story straight.

Uh, Aidan, could you, uh,
unlock the door, please?

417

[Knocking] Aidan, can you hear me?

He's in the bath.
It was open a second ago.

- Aidan, open the door!
- I'll get something to break it.

Oh, my God.
Baby, I'm sorry.

444
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,117
It wasn't him. It wasn't him.

445
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,872
I was just trying to help.

446
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,748
OK, Rachel, let's just
get him out of there.

447
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,918
Why is she doing this to me?

448
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,353
I'm here now, baby.

449
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,318
- Why is she doing this to me?
- It's OK, Aidan.

450
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,994
- We're gonna get you to a hospital.
- No!

451
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,116
- They can't do anything.
- [Coughing]

452
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,430
You asked for help,
you're gonna get help.

453
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,238
He gets to a hospital. Now.

[Crying]

455
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,239
[Man] We're working to raise
his core temperature.

456
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,197
He was at 90 degrees
when he came in.

457
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,479
- He wasn't outside overnight?
- No. He was at home with me.

458
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,757
A body doesn't develop
severe hypothermia on its own.

459
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,594
Whatever the cause, he's fighting it.
Seems like he's stabilizing.

460
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,036
- And he's just sleeping now?
- Right.

461
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,873
And having some kind of dream.

462
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,674
What's the story, Rachel?

463
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,156
They stabilized his temperature.

464
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,549
I mean the story
with you and Aidan.

465
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,676
You seem awfully hard on him.

466
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,999
Look, I know
it's a stressful time for you.

467
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,231
Moving. It's a whole new life.

468
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,118
Maybe you should tell me.

469
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,677
All I ever tried to do for him
was the right thing,

470
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,149
and it only ever
made things worse.

471
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,357
Then it wasn't
the right thing, was it?

472
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,635
[Rachel] What do you see?

473
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,311
Well, it's Aidan.

474
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,315
- Is that a girl there?
- Why is she in the picture?

475
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,233
- Why? How would I know?
- Why is she in all of them?

476
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,110
Her name's Samara.

477
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,718
She was murdered by her mother.
Left to die at the bottom of a well.

478
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,071
- Wait, she's... she's who?
- She didn't die.

479
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,756
At least, not her ghost.
I kept it alive for Aidan.

480
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,832
I let it out,
it spread and then we ran.

481
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,879
- What are you talking about?
- I know this sounds crazy,

482
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:20,238
but she's here now.
She's found us.

483
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,356
And I thought it was
just to hurt Aidan,

484
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,035
but it's more than that.
She wants to be him.

485
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,635
And she wants to live
for real this time.

486
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,639
You tell me, who can help me?

487
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,198
- Who?
- I'm sure there's a rational...

488
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,794
You take his picture
and tell me why she's in it.

489
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,075
- Rachel.
- You take his picture.

490
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,709
It's proof that he's what?
He's got a ghost inside him?

491
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,588
No. The proof
is what will happen.

492
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,035
[Rachel] Aidan,

493
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:12,079
you said Samara
couldn't hear us when we sleep.

494
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,788
Well, you're sleeping now.

495
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,233
Tell me how to stop her, honey.

496
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,271
Tell me how to help you.

497
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,318
Just tell me,
I'll do anything, I swear.

498

- Aidan?
- Miss Keller?

508
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,593
Hello, I'm Dr Emma Temple.

509
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,753
I'm a consulting physician
at County Child Services.

510
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,673
Well, I was hoping to speak
with Aidan when he wakes up.

511
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,074
Is everything all right in here?

512
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,549
Yeah. It's fine. Thank you.

513
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,234
[Dr Temple] I was hoping
to speak with you as well.

514
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,269
It's Rachel, isn't it?
Yeah, about his situation.

515
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,670
[Rachel] Sorry, what kind
of doctor did you say you were again?

516
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,159
I'm a psychiatrist.

517
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,155
Yeah. I spoke with a Dr, um...

518
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,959
...Koji in Seattle. Aidan's doctor.

519
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,474
Look, if we could
maybe talk later.

520
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,873
Right. Um, Dr Koji mentioned
that you dealt with some PPD

521
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,030
when Aidan was born.

522
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,553
Postpartum depression.

523
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,631
That was the first month.
That's all.

524
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,995
I understand. It's very common.

525
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,198
I mean, a lot of women have trouble
adapting to the stresses of motherhood.

526
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,671
What does this have to do with
what's going on with my son right now?

527
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,070
Have you been
under stress lately?

528
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,596
Have you ever found that you were...

529
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,877
...unable to experience love for Aidan?

530
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,475
- What?
- Have you hurt him,

531
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,993
however unintentionally?

532
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,719
Have you left him alone?
Abandoned him?

533
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,679
I'd like to be with my son,
please, if you don't mind.

534
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,870
Yeah, of course.

535
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,270
I'm sorry, Rachel.

[Beeping]

Until we can talk further,

538
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,635
I cannot let you be alone with him.

539
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,119
I'm his mother.

540
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,592
There are bruises on his body.

541
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,592
He was hypothermic
and very near death.

542
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,830
That is not because of me.

543
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,674
[Dr Temple] He's gonna
be all right. He will.

544
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,035
But you need to leave.

545
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,315
Now, please.

546
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,071
[Whispering] You can't have him,
Samara.

547
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,789
You're going back
to where you came from.

548
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,477
All I wanna know is what her
history was before the Morgans.

549
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,915
I'm sorry, but the
privacy laws still apply.

550
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,993
Well, was she really adopted?
Can you at least tell me that much?

551
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,311
- Was their story true?
- Samara Morgan was adopted, yes.

552
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,073
But you won't tell me from who?

553
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,357
- I'd lose my job if I did.
- [Sighing] Look, ma'am,

554
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,149
my son has a medical condition
that his doctors don't even understand.

555
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,390
This little girl
had the same condition.

556
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,632
Now, if I knew what caused that,
it could save his life.

557
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,599
[Woman] All I can say is you
should speak to the Morgans.

558
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,434
They're dead.
They both killed themselves.

559
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,992
Whoa! Look out. Early birds.

- How'd you get around the gate?
- Well, I just...

Ah! Who cares? Come on.

565
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,154
Make me an offer
over asking and it's yours.

566
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,879
OK, then, don't mind me.

took off flying. [chuckling]

There we go.

What do you think?

570
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:04,753
Um, a little colour will really
turn the place around.

571

And there's even this cute little
tree house thing way up in the barn.

574
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,911
Um, is the place being
sold unfurnished or?

575
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,594
The previous owners
didn't leave anything behind?

576
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:26,038
Well, there were some things
that were left, after they...

577
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,269
...moved.

578
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,794
We're storing all that
in the basement.

579
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,871
There's a basement?

580

Uh... Well, you betcha.
No extra charge.

Gotta open up the gate for everyone.

00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,396
So please,
just make yourself at home.

586
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,792
Do you know what happened
to them? The previous owners?

587
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,030
I believe they bought
a condo in Phoenix.

588

Well, she'll be here soon.

She didn't think that you
were gonna wake up so soon.

[Woman] I'm gonna walk you
just around the corner here.

628
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:00,197
Her name was Evelyn.

629
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:02,669
She came to us
eight months pregnant.

630
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,512
- Did she have her baby here?
- Yes.

631
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,431
And you arranged
for the adoption?

632
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,078
That's right.

633
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:11,948
- And the father?
- There was none.

634
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,870
Half the mothers
that come to us say that.

635
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:18,793
So, what did she think
got her pregnant?

636
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,949
Evelyn wasn't well.

637
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,759
She had been having problems
during the pregnancy:

638
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,195
Hallucinations, visions.

639
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,556
She believed some thing
had come for her baby

640
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,995
from the waters of the world
beyond this one.

641
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,230
I'm sorry. Did you say water?

642
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,916
Well, we all envision
the afterlife differently.

643
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,755
For Evelyn,
it's just what she believed.

644
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:46,799
As you might imagine, she suffered
severe postpartum depression.

645
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,997
She blamed her troubles
on her child.

646
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,878
So she tried to kill it.
