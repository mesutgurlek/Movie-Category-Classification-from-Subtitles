And in their paths,

And the fear of God is not

They have taken the hearts

00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,995
Only a few seconds got on the air.

167
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,332
It's time to forget about breaking in
on top of their signal.

168
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,459
They're only going to jam us out
again and again.

169
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,295
Then we have to send
the shipment out on the street.

170
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,714
No, no, no, that's not
going to work that way.

171
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,007
We've been all through this.

172
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,344
We have no other choice.

173
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,396
Robbing banks,
manufacturing Hoffman lenses

174
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,981
until we're blue in the face.

175
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,983
We're just not going to reach
enough people!

176
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,662
We've got to find new people,
strong people-- people to work with us.

177
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,938
That's my baby.

178
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,194
Just leaving--
you know, your door was open.

179
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,321
Just wanted to close it--
didn't want no one breaking in.

180
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,365
Neighborhood watch.

181
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,492
Yeah, well, let me touch your face.

182
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,162
- Mmm, it's good.
- That's fine.

183
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,621
Now your hands.

184
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,956
- That's fine.
- Good.

185
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,500
- Eh, you're a working man.
- Yes, sir.

186
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,044
Here, it's the revolution.

187
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,504
Let me show you.

188
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,464
I got to be going right now.

189
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,300
Maybe some other time, huh?

190
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,593
Huh?

191
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,845
This world may have blinded me,

192
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,973
but the Lord has let me see.

193
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,892
You'll be back.

194
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,269
You'll be back!

195
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,245
I've been hearing something
on the streets

196
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,206
the last couple of weeks.

197
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,082
Weird stuff.

198
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,584
Some sort of epidemic of violence

199
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,419
what they've been saying.

200
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,338
I was talking to one old boy,

201
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,673
he's from San Anselmo.

202
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,509
He told me they got
some sort of cult up there.

203
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,888
End of the world kind of stuff.

204
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,279
Well, what are they doing?

205
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,241
You know, shooting people,
robbing banks.

206
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,910
Same old thing as always.

207
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:50,998
Whole lot of people gone crazy
over some nutty dream they just had.

208
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,461
You want to know the truth?

209
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,089
This kind of shit happens
the end of every century.

210
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,634
It does-- it's just people
afraid to face the future.

211
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,052
It's all it is.

212
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:15,022
Hey, what's happening?

213
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,732
I was inside there a while.

214
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,611
All kinds of cardboard boxes,
some kind of lab set.

215
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,114
What do you mean?

216
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,532
There's no singing.

217
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,783
It's a tape recorder.

218
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,413
Leave it alone, man.

219
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,747
It ain't none of my business,

220
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,499
ain't none of yours.

221
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,294
Yeah, but our boy, Gilbert's
in there helping them.

222
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,843
Look, I got a job now.

223
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,386
And I plan on keeping it.

224
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,097
I'm walking a white line all the time.

225
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,266
I don't bother nobody,
nobody bothers me.

226
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,310
You better start doing the same.

227
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,570
White line's in the middle of the road.

228
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,782
It's the worst place to drive.

229
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:15,583
I'll see you later.

230
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,464
Step down.

231
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,799
Watch it.

232
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,634
Easy, easy, this way.

233
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,391
All right, now we're going
to cross the road.

234
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,767
It's dirt here.

235
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,188
[sirens blare]

236
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,694
Quickly, quickly!

237
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,102
- Go, go!
- Come on, this way-- this way.

238
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,497
Frank!

239
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,752
We know who you are.

240
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,546
Leave us alone!

241
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,425
We know you!

242
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,095
Don't hurt him either.

243
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,686
God help me!

244
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,773
Though I walk through the valley

245
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,109
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil.

246
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,528
Thy rod and Thy staff will--

247
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:06,957
Jesus! Jesus!

248
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,465
[groaning]

249
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,190
Come on!

250
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,369
Come on in and join the party, man.

251
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,122
You go with them.

252
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,673
[helicopter blades whir]

[sirens]

254
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,060
Somebody start World War III?

255
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,173
Oman's collection puts passion
before fashion.

256
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,800
Dash and trash are back.

257
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:26,388
Out goes glitter
and in comes divine excess.

258
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:30,100
The fall collection revels
in freedom of expression.

259
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,352
Gay abandon rushes to meet

260
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,855
the roaring '90s.

261
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,823
What's your problem?

262
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,372
I said, what's your problem?

263
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,591
How are you today, sir?

264
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,426
- Okay, how's it going?
- Fine, thank you.

265
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,263
Thank you, sir.

266
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,438
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.

267
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,500
Hey, buddy,

268
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,710
you going to pay for that or what?

269
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,844
Look, buddy,
I don't want no hassle today.

270
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,846
Either pay for it or put it back.

271
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,855
Huh.

272
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:55,277

Sleep, sleep, sleep...

Can you believe it?

274
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,144
She didn't even go to Lamaze class.

275
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,731
I told her,
for yourself and for the baby,

276
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,357
go!

277
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:11,978
Did Bob make you go
to John and Mary Ellen's last night?

278
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,106
I was shocked,
she served blue corn tortillas.

279
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,566
It's so dated.

280
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,276
[both laugh]

281
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,619
So depressed,
I don't know what to do.

00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,120
Hey, go for it, man.

283
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:32,165
It's easy for you to say,
you got the promotion.

284
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,501
Look, it'll come, all right?
Just don't worry about it.

285
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:38,129
The feeling is definitely there.

286
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,590
It's a new morning in America--

287
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,425
fresh, vital.

288
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,970
The old cynicism is gone.

289
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,347
We have faith in our leaders.

290
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,809
We're optimistic
as to what becomes of it all.

291
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:55,438
It really boils down
to our ability to accept.

292
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,357
We don't need pessimism.

293
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,442
There are no limits.

294
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,903
It figures it would be
something like this.

295

Uh.

That's what we got.

That's enough out of you.

Call the cops,
you know what you need?

plastic surgeon, that--

It would be easier if we don't have
to splatter your brains.

500
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,519
You know, that really answers
my fucking question.

501
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,021
Well, when you get
some kind of master plan

502
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,690
you let me know, huh?

503
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:32,117
We can't be the only
ones who can see.

504
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,246
We got to find the people
who made these.

505
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:40,208
Yeah, if any of them are still alive.

506
01:04:57,935 --> 01:05:00,687
A long time ago

507
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,356
things were different, man.

508
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:07,152
My own daddy
took me down to the river,

509
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:11,907
kicked my ass, told me
about the power and the glory.

510
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,992
I was saved.

511
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:17,120
He changed when I was little.

512
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,916
Turned mean.

513
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,751
Started tearing at me.

514
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,671
So I ran away when I was 13.

515
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:32,010
Tried to cut me, once.

516
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,889
Big old razor blade.

517
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,642
Held it up against my throat.

518
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,937
I said, "Daddy, please."

519
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:47,317
Just kept moving back and forth.

520
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,904
Like he was sawing down a little tree.

521
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,244
Maybe they've always been with us.

522
01:05:58,245 --> 01:06:00,121
Those things out there.

523
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,375
Maybe they love it.

524
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:06,294
Seeing us hate each other.

525
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,464
Watching us kill each other off.

526
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:12,258
Feeding on our own
cold fucking hearts.

527
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,264
I got news for 'em.

528
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,685
Going to be hell to pay.

529
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:26,690
Because I ain't
Daddy's little boy no more.

530
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,259
Frank?

531
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,816
There's a meeting tonight.

532
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,443
Be at this address at 11 o'clock.

533
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,611
Watch out no one follows you.

536
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:23,997
We're going to phone it in.

537
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:45,101
Hey, brothers.

538
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:49,856
There's something new going down.

539
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:20,512
They're using candy floss packages.

540
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,972
It's like building a park
for a toxic waste dump.

541
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:24,474
They colorized it.

542
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,186
Here's a list of safe houses.

543
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,563
You're going to memorize it
and then destroy the paper.

544
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:31,981
What's a safe house?

545
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:33,983
What kind of gun is that?

546
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,820
Hey, Frank.

547
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,988
- Hey.
- Hey, glad you made it.

548
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:40,907
Oh, you can take your sunglasses off.

549
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,408
We're all human in here.

550
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:50,875
Memorize these safe houses.

551
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,003
Brand new.

552
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:55,755
Got the first shipment today.

553
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,509
They won't hurt.

554
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,594
There's less interference.

555
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:04,430
Go ahead.

556
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:19,487
There is a signal broadcast
every second of every day

557
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,281
through our television sets.

558
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,491
Even when the set is turned off.

- Hey.

- Hi.
- You have any trouble getting here?

561
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,331
No, we made it fine.

562
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,084
Good, the city's crawling with cops
looking for us.

563
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:35,503
And most of the cops are human.

564
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,173
They've been told that we're commies
trying to bring down the government.

565
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,425
And some of them are being recruited.

566
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,719
Creatures are trading wealth, power.

567
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,554
You mean people
are joining up with them?

568
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:46,598
Most of us just sell out right away.

569
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:49,225
Then all of a sudden we get promoted.

570
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,269
Our bank accounts get bigger.

571
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,938
We start buying new houses, cars.

572
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:55,690
Perfect, isn't it?

573
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,942
We'll do anything to be rich.

574
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:00,695
Look around the environment we live in.

575
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:03,615
Carbon dioxide, fluorocarbons,
and methane

576
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,367
have increased since 1958.

577
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,162
Earth is being acclimatized.

578
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:13,499
They are turning our atmosphere
into their atmosphere.

579
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,835
What do these things want
and why are they here?

580
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:17,253
It's in our best interests.

581
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:18,630
They're free enterprisers.

582
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,549
The Earth is just another
developing planet.

583
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,301
Their third world.

584
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:26,304
We are like a natural resource
to them--

585
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:29,390
deplete the planet,
move on to another.

586
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,018
They want benign indifference.

587
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:34,145
They want us drugged.

588
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:35,605
We could be pets.

589
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,106
We could be food.

590
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:40,276
But all we really are is livestock.

591
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,240
Now, we need an assault unit.

592
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,533
Someone to hit them hard
when the time comes.

593

You've got it.

What's that?

01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,214
They all wear these expensive watches.

598
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:03,591
Turns out they're really
two-way radios.

599
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,593
You can listen to their broadcast.

600
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:12,850
There's something else.

601
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:15,853
Some kind of secret code
or hidden control.

602
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:18,898
They push a button
and then all of a sudden-- bang!

603
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,110
They're gone.

604
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,861
I've been trying to figure it out.

605
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:25,947
All right, now everybody listen up.

606
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,533
Now, we're obviously not getting
to enough people

607
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,243
because look at our numbers tonight.

608

There should be twice
as many of us here.

We're getting too sloppy,
that's all there is to it.

610
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:38,001
Now, their detection

611
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,211
is becoming more effective.

612
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:42,505
So we have to be more careful.

KRDA is clear.

All right, this is the point.

636
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,608
It's important to find out exactly
where this signal's coming from.

637
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,777
And the only way we can do--

01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:20,908
[woman's voice] Attention,
your wristwatch has malfunctioned.

665
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:24,245
This entryway is temporary
and will disappear in ten seconds.

666
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:25,663
- Get in there.
- What?

667
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:26,914
- Move.
- I don't know what's down there.

668
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,666
- Now!
- Oh, shit.

669
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,334
[woman's voice]
Seven seconds.

670
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,086
Six seconds.

671
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,879
Five seconds.

672
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,298
Four seconds.

673
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:36,674
Three seconds.

674
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,092
Two seconds.

675
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:39,635
One second.

676
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:46,475
[intercom] If you need assistance
in finding your destination,

677
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:50,396
bilingual instructions are posted
at the end of each corridor.

678
01:16:53,066 --> 01:16:55,359
What language is that?

679
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,736
I don't know.

680
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:58,904
Where the hell are we?

681
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:02,199
I think we're under the city.

682
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,118
Maybe some kind
of underground base or something.

683
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:08,039
There got to be a way out.

684
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:10,499
I just hope that nobody
saw us dropping in.

685
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:20,885
[radio] Operation Steel Fist
has been a complete success.

686
01:17:20,886 --> 01:17:23,220
All security stations stand down
to operational--

687
01:17:23,221 --> 01:17:24,513
Right.

688
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:26,307
- We have eliminated the terrorists.
- Okay.

689
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:29,477
We got 'em, we wiped them out!

690
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:31,646
It's a win, man.

691
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,689
They got to meet the A-team.

692
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,575
[distant applause]

693
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:46,535
I'm hearing something.

694
01:17:51,375 --> 01:17:54,335
[applause closer]

695
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:07,181
Our projections show
that by the year 2025,

696
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,434
not only America,
but the entire planet

697
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:13,062
will be under the protection
and the dominion

698
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:14,897
of this power alliance.

699
01:18:14,898 --> 01:18:17,108
The gains have been substantial,

700
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:19,902
both for ourselves and for you,

701
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,196
the human power elite.

702
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,876
You have given us entrée
to the resources we need

703
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:38,879
in our ongoing quest for
multidimensional expansion.

704
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,633
And in return, the per capita income
of each of you here tonight

705
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:47,680
has grown, in this year alone,
by an average 39o/o.

706
01:18:56,481 --> 01:19:00,568
And I've just received word that
our forces have won a major victory.

707
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:04,196
The underground terrorist network
has been destroyed

708
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:05,656
here on the West Coast.

709
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:07,408
We are off crisis alert.

710
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:09,869
The situation is normal again.

711
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,455
[crowd applause and cheers]

712
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,999
How you doing boys?

713
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,584
I didn't know you'd been recruited.

714
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,169
Welcome aboard.

715
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:21,630
You know you boys really
should have dressed for the party

716
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:23,382
now you can afford it.

717
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,721
I got to tell you,
I sure am proud to be here.

718
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,389
You seen the whole place?

719
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:33,601
I haven't had a chance to yet.

720
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,811
Come on, I'll show you around.

721
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:41,859
You know, I knew me and you
had a lot in common

722
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,737
first time we met.

723
01:19:44,738 --> 01:19:46,864
[speaker] Money isn't
the nicest thing in life,

724
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,908
- Hey, waiter,
- [speaker] the only thing.

725
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:50,868
Thank you, buddy.

726
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,413
Excuse me,

727
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:56,832
where the hell are we?

728
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,709
Back stage at the show, boys.

729
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:01,086
I'll admit it is a little funky,

730
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:02,797
but it serves its purpose.

731
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,883
How did you get here,
use one of these little portable jobs?

732
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,636
I know we ain't supposed to use 'em

733
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,429
except in cases of emergency,

734
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:13,182
but they're so much fun.

735
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:16,685
Now, you think that's something?

736
01:20:16,686 --> 01:20:18,229
Take a look at this.

737
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,649
Go on, take a closer look.

738
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,275
[intercom] Attention commuters,

739
01:20:23,276 --> 01:20:27,154
flight Alpha 7 to Andromeda
is now ready for boarding.

740
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:29,573
Please step in
to the transmission platform.

741
01:20:29,574 --> 01:20:30,866
That's where they come from.

742
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:33,035
All carry-on luggage
must be held securely.

743
01:20:33,036 --> 01:20:36,747
Thank you for waiting and we hope
you have a pleasant trip.

744
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:56,100
I don't know how it works exactly,
but it has to do with some sort

745
01:20:56,101 --> 01:21:01,146
of gravitational lens deal--
bending the light or some damn thing.

746
01:21:01,147 --> 01:21:03,232
But you can move from place to place,

747
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:04,942
world to world if you want to.

748
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:08,529
You see, the whole thing works
like one big airport.

749
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:13,909
Boys, let me tell you,

750
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,203
they got their act together.

751
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:18,080
Believe you me.

752
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,301
Evening, boys.

753
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,094
Looking sharp.

754
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:34,722
Wait until you see what
I'm going to show you now.

755
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:49,111
And here we got the brains
of the whole operation.

756
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:52,031
That's where the signal goes out
from here to the satellite.

757
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:53,782
We bump it out all over the world.

758
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:55,409
Pretty fancy, huh?

759
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,536
Not too familiar with it myself.

760
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:18,140
Well, boys, as far as we go.

761
01:22:18,141 --> 01:22:20,851
A technique called
multispectral analysis.

762
01:22:20,852 --> 01:22:22,728
This would allow space sensors

763
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:25,022
to penetrate natural barriers
and camouflage--

764
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,315
Can you get us inside?

765
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,528
I've never seen the inside
of a TV studio before.

766
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:33,822
You look like the gentleman to ask.

767
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:37,993
Well, I guess it wouldn't be
that much problem.

768
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:39,745
You see them boys over there?

769
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,622
Friends of mine.

770
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:45,125
Hey, fellas, I got a couple
of my buddies here.

771
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:47,252
Thought I'd give them the grand tour.

772
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:48,712
Think we can go inside?

773
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:50,422
Be serious.

774
01:22:50,423 --> 01:22:53,133
You have your authorization cards?

775
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:55,302
Right here.

776
01:22:58,014 --> 01:23:00,140
Watch the door.

777
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:04,186
[knocks on glass]

778
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:06,146
Soundproof.

779
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,857
- Where's that signal?
- It's up on the roof, I think.

780
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:11,568
Holly works in there.

781
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:13,362
If she made it,
maybe we can find her.

782
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,030
Then we can go to the roof
and break that signal, man.

783
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:17,366
Wait boys, wait
you're making a big mistake.

784
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:19,952
You made the mistake.

785
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:22,079
No, no, you got to listen to me.

786
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,789
I thought you boys understood.

787
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,791
It's business, that's all it is.

788
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:30,671
You still don't get it, do you boys?

789
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,090
There ain't no countries anymore.

790
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:34,508
No more good guys.

791
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:36,176
They're running the whole show.

792
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:38,470
They own everything--
the whole goddamn planet.

793
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,139
They can do whatever they want.

794
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,808
What's wrong with having it good,
for a change.

795
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:45,394
And they're going to let us
have it good if we just help 'em.

796
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:46,812
They're going to leave us alone.

797
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:48,147
Let us make some money.

798
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:50,941
You can have a little taste
of that good life too.

799
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:54,153
Now I know you want it--
hell, everybody does.

800
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:57,072
You do it to your own kind.

801
01:23:57,073 --> 01:23:58,907
What's the threat?

802
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:00,993
We all sell out every day.

803
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:03,078
Might as well be on the winning team.

804
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:07,916
See you, boys.

805
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:10,461
Let's go!

806
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,300
Is this the two minute break
or the thirty second break?

807
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:17,676
I think it's the thirty second break.

808
01:24:17,677 --> 01:24:20,137
They dropped 12,
I guess we must be running long.

809
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,472
I think so.

810
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:31,106
We are experiencing
a technical difficulty.

811
01:24:31,107 --> 01:24:32,941
What the hell's going on?

812
01:24:32,942 --> 01:24:34,109
Come on.

813
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:38,363
[people clamoring]

814
01:24:49,959 --> 01:24:52,211
Get down!

815
01:25:02,013 --> 01:25:03,931
[whispers] Now what?

816
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,641
Find out where the hell we are.

817
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,978
Excuse me.

818
01:25:09,979 --> 01:25:11,897
- Come on, man.
- Wait a second.

819
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:13,565
Do you know Holly Thompson?

820
01:25:13,566 --> 01:25:14,900
Come on, man, I mean it.

821
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:18,028
Holly Thompson, assistant program
something-or-other.

822
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:19,822
- Where is she?
- I, I...

823
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:22,241
[intercom] Security alert--
sections delta and x-ray

824
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:24,243
report to the fourth floor immediately.

825
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,578
Who's Holly?

826
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,665
[scream]

827
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:31,625
Oh, shit.

828
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,338
Well, I hate to interrupt you folks,

829
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:38,882
but could someone please guide me
how to get to the roof.

830
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:40,175
Security.

831
01:25:40,176 --> 01:25:42,094
How do I get to the roof?

832
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:43,595
There's an elevator through there.

833
01:25:43,596 --> 01:25:45,264
Turn to your left,
it's at the end of the hall.

834
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:47,099
Thank you very much.

835
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:01,071
Well?

836
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:03,657
Well, there's got to be more than
one way to get up there.

837
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:09,079
Security 9-5-0.

838
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,372
Lock the elevators down.

839
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:11,707
They're on the move.

840
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:14,459
[screams]

841
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:53,081
[beeping]

842
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:55,417
I hear them on the 19th floor
above me.

843
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:56,668
We got you.

844
01:26:56,669 --> 01:26:59,087
We're on the 21st
we'll be waiting for 'em.

845
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:10,140
Go, up.

846
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:23,028
Holly!

847
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:44,299
[alarm beeps]
- Come on, come on!

848
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,592
[intercom]
Security alert.

849
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:47,344
Intruders are here--
head for the roof.

850
01:27:47,345 --> 01:27:49,429
Repeat.
Intruders--

851
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:56,228
Let's go!

852
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:02,567
[gunshot]

853
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,214
Frank,

854
01:28:24,215 --> 01:28:26,091
you and Holly clear?

855
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:28,135
[woman]
I'm clear.

856
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,886
Are you?

857
01:28:33,891 --> 01:28:36,018
Don't do it.

858
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:44,276
Don't interfere,
you can't win.

859
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,496
Drop your weapon.

860
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,376
Stand away from the dish

861
01:29:01,377 --> 01:29:03,170
or we will open fire.

862
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,464
Come inside with me.

863
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:07,090
You have ten seconds.

864
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:09,634
Nine.

865
01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:12,137
Eight.

866
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,097
Seven.

867
01:29:14,098 --> 01:29:16,516
Six.

868
01:29:23,524 --> 01:29:25,067
Fuck it.

869
01:29:59,435 --> 01:30:02,437
The Oscar winners gave
a press conference

870
01:30:02,438 --> 01:30:04,523
and "How to Buy a Sailboat" as--

871
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,441
[man]
Gloria, you look like shit.

872
01:30:06,442 --> 01:30:08,276
[man] I'm out of here.
[woman] What happened?

873
01:30:08,277 --> 01:30:10,070
What's wrong?

874
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:14,908
All the sex and violence on the screen
has gone too far for me.

875
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,284
I'm fed up with it.

876
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:19,579
Filmmakers like George Romero
and John Carpenter

877
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:20,956
have to show some restraint.

878
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:22,374
They're simply--

879
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:25,919
You're filled with lightning
when you hit the road.

880
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,715
You're feeling that V6 power
as you take control.

881
01:30:30,716 --> 01:30:33,343
Nothing can stop you now.

882
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,220
You're moving on.

883
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:37,722
Hey, what's wrong, baby?
