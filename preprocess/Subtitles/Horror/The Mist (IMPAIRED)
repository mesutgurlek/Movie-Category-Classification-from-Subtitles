1
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:07,603
(thunder crashes)

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,507
(swing music playing)

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,169
(rain falling)

4
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,702
(music ceases)

5
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,018
BILLY: Whoa!

6
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,196
STEPHANIE:
All the food's gonna go bad.

7
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,135
Yeah, I drew up a list.

8
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,473
I'll hit the store
before it gets all bought out.

9
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,203
Fuck.

10
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,749
- Can you save it?
- No. No way.

11
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,411
No, I gotta start over from scratch.

12
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,751
I'll call the studio
when the phones get back up,

13
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,414
see if they can extend my deadline.

14
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,319
STEPHANIE:
What choice do they have?

15
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,918
(David sighs heavily)

16
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:10,985
You kiddin'?

17
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,897
They could whip up some bad
Photoshop poster in an afternoon.

18
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,231
They do it all the time.
Two big heads.

19
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,202
I should have brought it downstairs
with me last night.

20
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,932
Just stupid, I guess.

21
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,997
Well, sweetie,
you couldn't exactly know

22
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,009
that a tree was gonna come flying
through the window.

23
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,510
Yeah, I'll hit the hardware store too,

24
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,136
get some plastic sheeting
and duct tape

25
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,374
and seal this up
before it gets dark, you know.

26
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,041
Order in some new glass.

27
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,850
Oh, you know what?
That was your--

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,480
that was your grandfather's tree,
the one he planted.

29
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,286
- Ohh.
- Used to play in that tree.

30
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,519
It's just stuff, though.

31
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:43,118
You know, we're safe.
That's all that counts.

32
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,356
Yeah.

33
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,920
Mom, Dad, you gotta come see!

34
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,728
Hey, Billy, take it easy,
all right?

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,529
I really don't want you running
all over the place.

36
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:50,694
But you gotta come look.

37
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,762
The boathouse is all bashed!
Holy crap!

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,000
Billy.

39
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:58,134
Sorry, Mom, but you just
gotta come! Come on!

40
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,576
Whoa!

41
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,077
Whoa.

42
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,081
- Whoa.
- Come on.

43
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,083
Having spoken,
the Doomsayer departs.

44
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,745
- BILLY: Come on!
- (Stephanie chuckles)

45
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,811
How do you two always manage
to make me laugh?

46
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,553
- You have incredibly low standards.
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,652
Let's go, uh, see the damage.

48
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,718
No.

49
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,728
- Norton's tree.
- (sighs) Yeah.

50
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,273
You mean the dead one
I've been asking him

51
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,502
to take down for three years
before it finally blew over?

52
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,566
That tree?

53
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,805
- Really got smooshed.
- You ain't kiddin'.

54
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,878
Look at that.

55
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,313
What is it, Daddy?

56
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,312
Mist.

57
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,759
- On the lake?
- We've had mist on the lake before.

58
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,762
Coming off the mountain like that?

59
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,321
Two fronts meeting,

60
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,629
left over from the storm,
something like that.

61
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,192
You sure?

62
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,703
Honey, I'm not the weatherman.

63
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,932
Why don't you take Billy,
get him dressed.

64
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,338
I'll take him to town with me.

65
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,807
Okay. Where you going?

66
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,970
I'm gonna go have a little chat
with our neighbor about his tree.

67
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,138
Hon.

68
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,205
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
punch him in the nose.

69
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,614
You know what he's gonna say.

70
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,710
He's gonna say, "Sue me,"
which, I don't know, maybe we should.

71
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,585
Honey, one property dispute
with this guy

72
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,090
is enough to last me a lifetime.

73
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,820
I'm gonna ask
for his insurance information.

74
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:22,883
Okay.

75
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,953
- That's all.
- Yeah.

76
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,795
(Norton grunting,
pulling chainsaw chain)

77
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,495
NORTON: Ohh!
Mother fucker!

78
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,140
Aw, shit!

79
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,676
Ohh, you mother fucker!

80
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,001
Cock sucker!

81
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,170
"Turn on.

82
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,444
"Full choke.

83
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,679
Pull five... choke."

84
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,615
I guess you've seen the--

85
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,183
boathouse.

86
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,593
Yeah, and--?

87
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,291
Nothin'.

88
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:02,698
Just think we should trade
insurance info, you know?.

89
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,758
That's all.

90
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,396
(scoffs)

91
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,963
Oh, my insurance guy's
gonna love me.

92
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,176
Oh.

93
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,237
Shit. The 1980.

94
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,180
NORTON: I was gonna bring
the station wagon, but...

95
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,482
I don't know, the weather was
so beautiful coming out of New York,

96
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,783
I just--
You know, top down.

97
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,584
I'm sorry, man. I mean it.

98
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,147
Sincerely.

99
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,523
- That's nice of you to say.
- No, that car was cherry.

100
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,223
I hate to see it like that.

101
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,658
Okay, I'll tell you what,

102
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,534
I'll find my insurance guy's number,
I'll bring it by later.

103
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,163
- That okay?
- No problem.

104
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,502
So, uh, David--

105
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,683
you're not heading into town today
by any chance, are you?

106
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,295
DAVID:
Well, CMP's out in force.

107
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:12,797
Maybe we'll get our power back.

108
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,897
NORTON:
I know. Some storm, huh?

109
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,271
One for the books, yeah.

110
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,003
For a moment there last night,

111
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,511
I thought we were gonna take off
and head for Oz.

112
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,639
WZON is off the air,

113
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,945
but Portland's still broadcasting.

114
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,006
Daddy, look.

115
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:27,917
Ah.

116
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,852
Guys from the base.

117
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,480
- From up the mountain?
- Uh-huh.

118
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,149
The Arrowhead Project?

119
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:35,983
Well, you're a local.

120
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,825
Any idea what they do up there?

121
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,387
Missile defense research.

122
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,296
You know, I'm sure
you've heard the stories.

123
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,356
Oh, sure.

124
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,835
The woman at the Laundromat
says that, uh,

125
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,998
they have a crashed flying saucer
up there with frozen alien bodies.

126
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,837
Right. Miss Edna. Yeah.

127
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,503
Miss Tabloid.
(chuckles)

128
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,240
"I Had Bigfoot's Baby."

129
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,076
"Satan's Face Appears
in Oil Well Fire."

130
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,483
You know, real reliable stuff.

131
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,714
DAVID: Well, they're in a hurry.

132
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,454
Maybe their power's out too.

133
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,692
Huh. Still no signal.

134
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,968
Why don't you go ahead?
I'm gonna try Steph on a pay phone.

135
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,736
Can I go with Mr. Norton, Daddy?

136
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,608
Sure, if you promise
to hold his hand, I guess.

137
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,668
- BILLY: Yeah.
- Yeah.

138
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,339
Here's a list.

139
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,746
- Sure.
- Okay?

140
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,011
Meet you guys in there.

141
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,075
Hold hands.

142
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,189
MAN: I'm sorry. I didn't know
it was your sister.

143
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,592
(pulsing tone)

144
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:45,597
(clicks phone cradle;
pulsing tone continues)

145
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,724
BOY: That looks so freaky!

146
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,789
Hmm.

147
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:56,597
(chatter)

148
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,234
- Sally, hey.
- Hey, Mr. Drayton.

149
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,869
You guys look jammed up.

150
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,074
Yeah, well, half the staff
didn't show, plus the power's out.

151
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,481
Oh, no. What,
no backup generator?

152
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,041
Only to keep the food cold.

153
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,677
Everything else,
welcome to the Dark Ages,

154
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:09,846
and bring your checkbook.

155
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,413
Hey, Thursday night,
Steph and I want a date night.

156
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,926
- Baby-sit?
- Heck, yeah. I'm there.

157
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,554
Oh, my God.

158
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,120
OLLIE: (humorless chuckle)
The storm.

159
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,292
Everybody's stockin' up.
Been like this since we opened.

160
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:23,528
Crappy day, huh?

161
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,094
Eh, everyone's a little
pissed off this morning.

162
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,003
'Morning, Mrs. Carmody.

163
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,735
With lines like these,
I don't know how good it is,

164
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,041
but I guess we'll have to make do.

165
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,506
- Keep your head down, pal.
- I know it.

166
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,309
Hey, champ.

167
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,820
Your wife should be a doctor.

168
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,052
She could make a fortune
in Manhattan with this handwriting.

169
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,924
Yeah, it takes some getting used to.

170
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:52,157
Why don't you get your stuff?
I'll meet you at the checkout.

171
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,220
Okay, done.

172
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,130
Hey, David,
thanks for helping me out today.

173
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,933
Are you and Mr. Norton
gonna be friends now, Daddy?

174
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,535
Oh, I don't know.

175
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,938
"Friends" might be stretching it a little.

176
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,316
I guess you're not mad
at each other anymore.

177
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,375
I guess not.

178
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,783
And that's a start, huh?

179
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,815
BUD: I'm sorry, ma'am,
the registers are down.

180
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,884
The power outage got us too.

181
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,624
Hopefully we'll have
power up pretty soon.

182
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:29,327
(indistinct conversation)

183
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,393
(chuckles)

184
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,170
- The bus leaves in 30 minutes.
- We'll make it, okay?

185
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,235
You guys get the goodies.
I'll wait in line.

186
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,648
(customers chattering)

187
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,585
BUD: I need some change
on register five.

188
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,246
Good morning, Ms. Reppler.

189
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,586
BILLY: Hello, Ms. Reppler.

190
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,821
Well, hello to you, Billy Drayton.

191
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,556
How'd you hold up in the storm?

192
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,791
We had a tree come through
the picture window last night,

193
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,025
right in my studio.

194
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,069
And the boathouse got all smooshed.
Mr. Norton's tree fell on it.

195
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,125
IRENE: Ouch.

196
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,695
- Yeah.
- IRENE: Sorry to hear that.

197
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,941
DAVID:
How'd you guys make out?

198
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,174
HATTIE: Oh, we're fine.
It's the listings I'm worried about.

199
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,080
At the very least, I'll bet every one
of our "For Sale" signs fell over.

200
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,812
IRENE: We had damage
at the school, wouldn't you know?.

201
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,878
That's what we get for not fixing
that roof when we should've,

202
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,483
but with funds being cut every year...

203
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,027
You'd think educating children

204
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,290
would be more
of a priority in this country,

205
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,457
but you'd be wrong.

206
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,660
Government's got better things
to spend our money on,

207
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,399
like corporate handouts
and building bombs.

208
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,465
(passing sirens wail)

209
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,679
(fire truck horn blares)

210
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,544
Daddy, is there a fire?
Is Mommy all right?

211
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,419
I'm sure she's fine.
Don't worry, okay?

212
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,982
Mind what you're doing, Sally.

213
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,588
SOLDIER: Oh, come on,
we got 10 days' leave.

214
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,687
Check our papers.

215
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,755
Look, I told you,
all leaves are cancelled.

216
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,821
I don't know why.

217
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,891
I gotta go check the pharmacy out.

218
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,437
Three men meet me
back at the Jeep in five minutes.

219
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,494
That's an order.

220
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,500
Shit, man! Another half an hour,
and we'd have been gone.

221
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,117
(Klaxon blares)

222
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,322
(Klaxon continues)

223
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,304
Oh, my God!

224
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,986
Something in the mist!

225
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,921
- (excited shouting)
- Something in the mist...

226
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,481
...took John Lee!

227
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,891
Dan, catch your breath.

228
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,826
Something in the mist took John Lee.

229
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,659
I could hear him screaming.

230
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,667
Shut the doors! Shut the doors!
My God!

231
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,396
Daddy, I'm scared.
Can we go home?

232
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,461
(Klaxon blares)

233
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,896
DAN: Don't go out there.

234
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,205
There's something in the mist.
It took John Lee.

235
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,768
MAN: Screw that!
I'm gettin' in my car.

236
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,337
Mister, no!

237
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,440
(police siren wails)

238
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,179
(police siren ceases)

239
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,622
(keys jangling)

240
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,165
(man screaming)

241
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,104
Please hold me.

242
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,173
- (Billy whimpers)
- It's okay, it's okay.

243
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:09,381
CORNELL: It's a pollution cloud.
The mills down in Rumford.

244
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,549
Some kind of chemical explosion.
Has to be.

245
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,416
MAN: (whispering)
What is it?

246
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,152
What's going on?

247
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,493
It's death.

248
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,558
Aah!

249
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,537
(crashing and rumbling)

250
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,596
(screaming and shouting)

251
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:42,484
(screaming)

252
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,320
(building girders groaning)

253
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,703
- (screaming and shouting)
- MAN: Stay down!

254
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,066
BILLY: Daddy!

255
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,234
(rumbling stops)

256
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,073
(woman coughing)

257
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,736
(woman weeping)

258
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,043
MAN: (faintly)
You okay?

259
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,516
(coughing)

260
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,750
That was an earthquake.

261
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,060
I tell you, the goddamn mills blew up!

262
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:29,589
OLLIE: Is everyone okay?
Is anyone hurt?

263
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,967
Everybody just stay put, okay?
Just stay inside the store.

264
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,905
I can't. I can't stay here.
I gotta get home to my kids.

265
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,069
MRS. CARMODY: No.
No, don't go out there.

266
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,942
It's death out there.
It's the end of days.

267
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,039
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

268
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,949
NORTON: Please, everybody,
everybody just relax, okay?

269
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,010
He's right. Let's just stay cool.

270
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,487
Let's just try to figure out
what happened.

271
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,925
I'm sorry, I-- I can't just stay here.
I have to get home to my kids.

272
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,894
Ma'am, no, you can't go out there.

273
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,657
Could be a poisonous gas cloud.

274
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,221
Didn't you hear that man screaming?

275
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,961
I agree. Let's stay here
until we figure it out.

276
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,400
WOMAN: You're not listening!

277
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,665
I can't stay here.

278
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,640
Wanda's looking after little Victor.
She's only 8.

279
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:15,578
Sometimes she forgets
she's supposed to be watching him.

280
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,913
I told them I'd only be gone
a few minutes.

281
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,419
She's only 8.

282
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,925
For their sakes,

283
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,324
don't.

284
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:37,024
Well, isn't anybody gonna help me?

285
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,503
DAVID: (softly)
Shh. It's okay, pal.

286
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,199
Won't somebody here
see a lady home?

287
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,376
You?

288
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,048
You?

289
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,796
- DAVID: (softly) It's okay, buddy.
- You?

290
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,169
Ma'am, please,
I got my own boy to worry about.

291
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,810
I hope you all rot in hell.

292
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,075
OLLIE:
Ma'am, please, wait until--

293
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,837
(soft weeping)

294
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,744
BUD: Okay,
let's start cleaning up, okay?

295
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,482
Get the spilled bottles,
broken glass, stuff like that.

296
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,218
Aisle three has medical supplies.

297
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,125
- (Billy crying)
- It's okay. It's okay.

298
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,890
All right, easy, champ.
Come on.

299
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:12,953
Come on.

300
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,694
Come on.
All right, hey, hey, hey.

301
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,429
Can't keep crying like this, pal.

302
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,834
Come on!

303
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,895
Come on,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

304
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,305
- Come on, are you all right?
- I want Mommy!

305
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,865
All right, I know you want Mommy.

306
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,411
(very softly)
All right, just try to breathe.

307
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,810
Just try to breathe, okay?

308
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,246
(Billy crying)

309
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,146
Just try to breathe, pal.
That's okay.

310
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,878
- (Billy crying)
- It's all right.

311
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,582
I haven't seen him suck his thumb
like this since he was 2 years old.

312
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,455
AMANDA: He's in shock.

313
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,256
I think we all are.

314
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,693
IRENE: You haven't met.

315
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,597
Amanda Dunfrey.

316
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,826
She's new in town
as of this semester.

317
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,325
Teaches third grade

318
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,668
and the special ed kids,
now that Mosher's retired.

319
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,674
She's wonderful.
The kids love her.

320
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,837
And David's an artist.

321
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,881
He does movie posters and such.

322
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:03,937
And me...

323
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:09,419
Lord, I'm babbling away
like some old biddy at a tea party!

324
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,978
My nerves are jangled, I guess.

325
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,284
Boy settle down?

326
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,847
How is he?

327
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,984
Still hot.

328
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,550
Why don't I get him some aspirin.

329
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,493
- Aisle three.
- Okay.

330
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,088
Thanks.

331
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,655
DAVID: How's Dan?

332
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,564
His nose stopped bleedin'.

333
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,967
He's calmer now.
Somebody gave him a Valium.

334
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,129
Can't believe the way he ran in here.

335
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,302
Never seen him like that.

336
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,675
I need something to cover my boy up.
Got any blankets?

337
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,608
Furniture pads. Loadin' dock.

338
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,743
Gonna keep checkin' on people.
If you need anything, just holler.

339
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,912
You bet. Sally, you mind?

340
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,320
Oh, I'd love to. I really should
help him clean up.

341
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,790
- I'll take him.
- Okay.

342
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,849
Daddy, don't go.

343
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,090
No, I'll be gone two seconds, Big Bill.
Come on, I'm gonna get your blanket.

344
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,064
Mrs. Reppler's here,

345
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,124
and so is Mrs. Turman.

346
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,659
I'll be close by, okay?

347
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,331
- Okay.
- Don't worry, I'm not far. Okay?

348
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,396
Let me look at you.

349
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,267
Hmm?

350
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,139
HATTIE: Wanna lie down?

351
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,204
Yeah.

352
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,546
There you go.

353
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,282
NORTON: Soon as it blows away,
we can walk out of here safe and free,

354
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,789
but we have to be smart about it.

355
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,519
First thing we need to do
is keep our wits about us

356
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,151
and find out what's happened.

357
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,718
MAN: Well, Howe gonna
do that, my man?

358
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,390
We've got no phone signal,
got no radio.

359
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,026
NORTON: I'm sure they're working
on those problems as we speak.

360
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,332
It stands to reason
that restoring communications

361
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,393
would be their top priority.

362
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,463
(machinery hums)

363
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,642
(David coughs)

364
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,344
(coughing)
Jeez!

365
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,893
(coughs)

366
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,034
Oh, shit.

367
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,032
- (sharp crack)
- Ow!

368
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,002
Shit!

369
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,346
(grunts)

370
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,512
God damn it!

371
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,578
Ow! Ow!

372
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,782
Bitch!

373
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,018
NORTON: It's obvious that we're--

374
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,084
we're in some kind
of natural disaster here.

375
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:32,790
MAN: Ain't nothin' obvious
about this sombitch from where I sit.

376
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:35,196
CORNELL: There ain't nothin'
natural about it either.

377
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,256
MAN: That's right.

378
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,997
MRS. CARMODY: It's Judgment Day,
and it's come round at last.

379
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,562
There is nothing more obvious
or natural than that.

380
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,130
MAN: Ohh, fuck, now.

381
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,869
MRS. CARMODY:
You've done that to yourself,

382
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,843
by a life of sin and dissolution.

383
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,889
(metal rumbling and creaking)

384
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,817
(rumbling and creaking cease)

385
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,160
(metal rumbling and creaking)

386
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,334
(creaking loudly)

387
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,852
Hey, whoa! David!

388
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,292
DAVID: Hey, you guys hear that?

389
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,262
The generator?
We're just gonna check it out.

390
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,196
No, no, I turned the generator off.

391
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,257
It-- it was backing up.

392
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,270
- N-nobody else heard that sound?
- What sound?

393
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:51,970
I don't know, like a... weird noise,

394
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,807
back there in the dark.

395
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,370
Like something was, like,
pressing against the door.

396
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,975
Did you hear it
before the lights went out, or after?

397
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,917
No, only after.

398
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,251
After, but, look, I heard it, okay?

399
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,382
- Nobody's calling you a liar.
- That's what it sounds like.

400
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,120
JIM: No, no, no, no.
Now, don't be thattaway, Mr. Drayton.

401
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,253
You had a scare, no doubt.

402
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,991
What say we all go check it out?

403
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,498
Here.

404
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,436
JIM: Oooopf!
(chuckles)

405
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,496
Man.

406
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,668
It's pretty rank in here.

407
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,871
- Myron, go check it out.
- All right.

408
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,113
Go on, fire it up.

409
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,948
(generator whirrs to life)

410
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,124
JIM: (laughing)
All right!

411
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,287
Shut it off!

412
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,093
Holy crow, don't that stink!

413
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:49,432
MYRON: Something's
got the exhaust vent

414
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,128
plugged up from the outside.

415
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,637
You get it running long enough
to raise that door a little,

416
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,195
I'll go out and clear
whatever's blockin' it.

417
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,433
No, no, you can't do that.

418
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,499
MYRON: Why not?
It's an electric door, right?

419
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,569
Well, yeah, but it may not be wise
to send him out there.

420
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:02,977
MYRON: Okay, I'll do it.

421
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,948
No, look, it's not about
who goes out there.

422
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,007
What, don't you think I can do it?

423
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,713
Hey! I want to go!
It was my idea.

424
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,278
Well, wait, just stop, okay?

425
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,948
- J-Jim, right?
- JIM: Mm-hmm.

426
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,515
Myron? You guys are--

427
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,688
you, well, you don't seem
to understand,

428
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,321
or you're tryin' real hard not to.

429
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,059
This is no ordinary mist, okay?

430
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:24,296
You open that door,
and something gets in here.

431
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,529
NORM: Like what?

432
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,738
Well, like whatever
made that noise I heard.

433
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,297
Are you guys being willfully dense?

434
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,707
Mr. Drayton, you'll pardon me,

435
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:36,441
but I'm not convinced
that you heard anything.

436
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,346
I mean, we're not
hearing anything now, right?

437
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,406
Anybody?

438
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,741
See?

439
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,014
(Jim chuckles)

440
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,114
Now, I know, I know--
you're a big shot artist

441
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,682
with connections in New York
and Hollywood and all like that,

442
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,058
but that don't make you better
than anybody else, not in my book.

443
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,494
Hey, I didn't say that.

444
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,896
Nor do I like being talked down to
or called stupid

445
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,935
by a guy who went to college,
just 'cause he's got the jitters.

446
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,164
Fellas, it doesn't even matter
about the generator.

447
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,603
The food'll keep without it.

448
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,403
Kid, I'm gonna start the motor,
you raise the door,

449
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,103
and you yell out
when you got enough room.

450
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,702
Yeah. Okay, good.

451
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,542
DAVID: Wait.

452
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,603
This is--

453
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,582
You guys gonna let
this kid risk his life

454
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,380
over a generator
that doesn't even matter?

455
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,886
Would you just
shut the fuck up already?

456
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,943
OLLIE: Norm!

457
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,013
JIM: Listen, Mr. Drayton,
I tell you what.

458
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,081
The next time
you got somethin' to say,

459
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,524
you count your teeth,

460
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,927
because I'm sick to death
of your bullshit.

461
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,487
All right?

462
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,555
Come on, Myron.

463
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,294
- DAVID: This is crazy!
- OLLIE: Leave 'em be.

464
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,336
What am I, impugning
their manhood or something?

465
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,895
Listen, they've lost
their sense of proportion.

466
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,304
What's going on here?

467
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,137
Out there in the market,
they were scared and confused.

468
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,201
In here, there's a problem
they can solve,

469
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,303
so they're goddamn gonna solve it.

470
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,870
- MYRON: Ready, kid?
- Let's rock.

471
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,314
Norm, come on.

472
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:46,372
Don't, man.

473
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,684
(generator whirrs to life)

474
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,915
DAVID: It's a mistake.

475
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,689
Pussy.

476
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,293
Go up!

477
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,616
So...

478
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,181
any boogeymen?

479
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,750
(Jim laughs)

480
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,586
JIM: Pretty scary, ain't it, Norm?

481
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,723
Yeah, right.

482
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,960
(laughter)

483
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:38,958
MYRON: Norm.

484
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,730
Norm!

485
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,103
What the fuck!

486
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,732
Ahh! Get it off! Get it off!

487
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,709
Get this friggin' thing off me!

488
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,507
Get it off! Help me!

489
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,375
Help me! Help me!

490
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,915
Aah! Aaahhh!

491
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,382
Jesus!

492
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:57,115
(Norm shouting)

493
00:26:03,627 --> 00:26:06,619
There's more! There's more!

494
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,631
Somebody help me.

495
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,159
Somebody help me.

496
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,898
What the fuck are you waitin' for?

497
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,940
(Norm crying and shouting)

498
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,678
Aaahhhh!

499
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,683
Hang on!

500
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,417
Aaahhhh!

501
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,592
Hold him still!
Hold him still!

502
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,425
Aaahhhh!

503
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,565
Oh, Jesus!

504
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:55,178
(Norm grunting and straining)

505
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,782
(monster sniffing)

506
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,255
MYRON: Aah!

507
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:18,758
Aah!

508
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,636
JIM: Shit! Oh, shit!

509
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,803
Oh, shit!

510
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,742
OLLIE: David, it's no good!

511
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,805
Aah!

512
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,374
DAVID: Start the generator.

513
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,012
Aah! Aaaggghhh!

514
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:49,722
Gaaahhhh!

515
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,566
(Norm screams)

516
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,123
(monster shrieks)

517
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:44,918
Hey, I'm sorry.

518
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,086
I mean, how the--

519
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,185
how the hell was I supposed
to know what you meant?

520
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,224
You said you heard something.

521
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,057
How was I supposed to know
what you meant?

522
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,329
You should've said
what you meant better.

523
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,895
I don't know, I thought maybe
it was a big bird or something.

524
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,339
You got that kid killed!

525
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,377
Did you get a good look at it? Huh?

526
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,607
Did you get a good look
at what you did?

527
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:10,875
- Huh?
- David!

528
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,280
Don't hit him anymore!
Doesn't solve anything!

529
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,183
You two assholes,
you got that kid killed!

530
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,244
And I got his fuckin' blood on me!

531
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,750
(groaning)

532
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,065
(David panting)

533
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,136
Okay, I'm done.

534
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:42,235
Okay.

535
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,806
What's next?

536
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,343
Kill the generator.

537
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,014
That's the first thing.

538
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,291
JIM: I'm sorry.

539
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,092
DAVID:
Jesus Christ! Oh, God!

540
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,728
JIM: I'm-- I'm sorry about the kid.

541
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,967
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

542
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,740
We oughta get out of here.

543
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,143
(coughing and retching)

544
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,412
Hey, we didn't twist his arm.

545
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,782
Yeah, he's a fuckin' kid.
He's supposed to be stupid.

546
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,687
What's your excuse, huh?

547
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,223
Get outta here.

548
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,126
Go back in the market.
Stay by the door.

549
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,433
Don't say anything, to anybody.

550
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,027
Not yet.

551
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:41,595
Not yet.

552
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:49,537
(generator whirrs)

553
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:53,606
(generator stops)

554
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,643
OLLIE: (softly)
Shit.

555
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,953
David? Need a little light here.

556
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,566
We have to tell 'em.

557
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:16,470
The people in the market,
we have to stop 'em going outside.

558
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,106
They won't believe us.

559
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,400
They have to.

560
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,743
I'm not sure I believe it.
I was here.

561
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,875
W-what we saw was impossible.

562
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,885
You know that, don't you?

563
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:29,942
I mean, what--

564
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:32,953
what do we say?

565
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,620
How do we convince them?

566
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,623
Ollie, what the hell were
those tentacles even attached to?

567
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,806
Oh, my God!
Are-- are you all right?

568
00:31:51,876 --> 00:31:54,367
DAVID: Shh! Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's not my blood. I'm fine.

569
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,776
W-what the hell happened?

570
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,644
I'll explain. Give me a minute, okay?

571
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,706
I need to deal with something first.

572
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,211
Please, I've got to--

573
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:06,018
I can't let Billy see me like this.
He's scared enough.

574
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,957
Just give me a minute.
Keep him distracted. Okay?

575
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:10,016
Okay.

576
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,702
JIM: Hey, look,
I'm sorry about Norm.

577
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,135
Me too.

578
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,604
I mean, I ain't makin' excuses,
I'm just sayin'.

579
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,971
Look, we need to tell people.

580
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,533
No need to say how it went down
or anything like that,

581
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,376
but, uh, we're in the deep shit here.

582
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,914
People need to know.

583
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,540
MYRON:
What about the out-of-towners?

584
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,381
We got plenty of them in the store.
Where do we even start?

585
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,683
- OLLIE: Brent Norton?
- JIM: That windbag?

586
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,485
He's an important attorney
in New York.

587
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,719
That fellow could be
on the bench one day.

588
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,285
Counts a lot with people of this town,
or-- or anywhere.

589
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,887
- MYRON: Yeah, that's right.
- Do it quick, David.

590
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,900
We've got to discuss how we're gonna
stop that thing getting in here.

591
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,731
W-wait. What do you mean
getting in?

592
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,827
You shut the loading door.

593
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:57,466
Yeah, but the entire front of the store
is plate glass.

594
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,303
Jesus Christ.

595
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,689
NORTON: I was wondering
where you'd gotten to.

596
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,250
DAVID: Um, listen...

597
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,092
that guy that came in here,
the one with the bloody nose...

598
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,826
(conversation continues indistinctly)

599
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:29,096
...they're-- they're--
We saw tentacles.

600
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,606
Ain't goin' very well, is it?

601
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:33,166
Unh-unh.

602
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,735
- You... what?
- Come here, you've got--

603
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,142
Come here.

604
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,207
Tell him.

605
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:44,276
It's true.

606
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,529
Tentacles. Yeah.

607
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,197
Um, gentlemen, um...

608
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,004
I'm sorry, I--
I'm just not that stupid.

609
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,478
I mean, what do you take me for?

610
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,242
I'm shocked.

611
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,305
I'm shocked.

612
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,511
I'm shocked. It's pretty tasteless

613
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,577
using what's happening here
to try to make me look like an idiot.

614
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,316
No, no, that's not
what's going on here.

615
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,358
Look, come back
to the loading dock, okay?

616
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,415
I'll show you.

617
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:26,088
Blood. A chunk of tentacle
on-- on the floor.

618
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,153
No.

619
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,926
No? What do you mean no?

620
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,161
No. We've got real problems
to deal with here,

621
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,398
and this pathetic attempt at a joke

622
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,406
has gone far enough.

623
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:39,466
Mr. Norton, what reason
could we possibly have--?

624
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:41,170
Oh, please! Please!

625
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,736
This is payback for the lawsuit
that I filed against him last year,

626
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,646
and you guys are backing him up.

627
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,377
So winning wasn't enough, huh?

628
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,647
You wanted to humiliate me
some more,

629
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,052
show me a rubber snake
while these-- these hicks

630
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,454
stand around laughing their asses off.

631
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:54,786
- Watch who you callin' a hick!
- Myron! Myron!

632
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,724
- Hey, hey, fuck--!
- JIM: Mr. Norton...

633
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,388
... I swear, you have
got us all wrong.

634
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:03,958
You're not too crazy about,
um, out-of-towners, are you?

635
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:07,061
I only spend my money,
and I pay my taxes here,

636
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:11,006
and I have seen you
talking behind my back.

637
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,843
Y'all stick together.

638
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,842
Well, don't I feel foolish?

639
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,407
I actually thought you were
being kind to me today,

640
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:22,976
and, well, thanks
for setting me straight.

641
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,215
And I'm glad that tree fell
on your boathouse, you know that?

642
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,689
Glad. Smashed it in
pretty good, didn't it? Fantastic.

643
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,350
Now, all of y'all,
just stay out of my way.

644
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:31,987
I know you're scared, man.
I'm scared too.

645
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,122
- Lives are at stake around here.
- David--

646
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,530
Okay, my son's life.
Now, I need you.

647
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:40,162
Brent, please,
get your head out of your ass.

648
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,297
All right, I'll drag you
back there if I have to.

649
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:43,362
Come here.

650
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,433
David, get your goddamn hands
off of me!

651
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,445
I'll sue your ass again!

652
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,777
Sue your ass, and this time
you'll go to jail!

653
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:52,338
This man assaulted me.

654
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:55,044
He assaulted me.
You were witness to it.

655
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,108
This man's crazy.
He's crazy.

656
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,814
No.

657
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,289
He isn't. I wish he was, but he isn't.

658
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,417
(scoffs)

659
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:06,623
E-everyone in the store,
you want to come back here?

660
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,326
There's something you need to hear.
It concerns you all.

661
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,698
Okay.

662
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,761
BUD: W-w-wait. I don't know
what you people think you're doing.

663
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,329
You're drinking?

664
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:17,897
For Christ's sake, Ollie.

665
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,004
Do you want me to report you?
You want to lose your job?

666
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,979
Look, I'm gonna be taking down
names, starting with you.

667
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,016
And I am prepared to file
a police report.

668
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,074
- Fine, Bud, write down your names.
- I will.

669
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:30,985
But in the meantime,
shut the fuck up and listen.

670
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,018
This is Mr. David Drayton.

671
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:37,424
You need to hear what he's got to say
if you're thinking about leaving.

672
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,156
DAVID:...go hang out
with the ladies, all right?

673
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,561
Listen, don't be scared.

674
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:43,722
It's okay.

675
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:46,926
Okay.

676
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,436
This is how it is.

677
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:51,940
Now, I don't know
what this mist is...

678
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,174
but there are things in it, and they're
dangerous, like Dan said.

679
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,235
That's right.

680
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:58,645
That's exactly right.

681
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,581
MAN: What kind of things?

682
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,641
I never saw it.
It happened too fast.

683
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,517
I got knocked down.

684
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,751
Five of us went back
in the loading dock.

685
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:10,419
It was Jim, Myron, Ollie...

686
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,155
me...

687
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,720
Norm, the bag boy.

688
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,288
- We opened the door...
- Where's Norm?

689
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:19,097
...so Norm could go out
and clear the vent for the generator.

690
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,031
Something come out of the mist
and took him.

691
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:23,095
Took him?

692
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,766
What do you mean?

693
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,504
Just... killed him.

694
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,443
I mean dragged him off.

695
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:34,075
Now, guys, I don't know
what these things are.

696
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,642
All we saw were tentacles.

697
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:39,589
(onlookers muttering)

698
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,580
WOMAN: Tentacles?

699
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,354
NORTON: Tentacles, he says.

700
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,024
Tentacles from Planet X.

701
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,431
It's a lie, you know.

702
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,629
I mean, all these people do
is just lie each other up.

703
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:54,932
It's a pile of shit.

704
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,496
Of course it's a lie.
Of course it's a lie.

705
00:37:56,573 --> 00:37:57,562
It's lunacy.

706
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,136
From the look of it, the tentacles
are coming out of the beer cans.

707
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,907
All right, uh, Bud,
don't take our word for it.

708
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,969
Go look.

709
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:11,710
DAVID: (softly)
Over there.

710
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,885
What the hell is that?

711
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,398
(sizzling sound)

712
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:54,695
It appears we may have a problem
of some magnitude here.

713
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,371
Yeah, just keep 'em in line.
Thanks.

714
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,055
Let me...

715
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:30,598
help these people.

716
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,499
Let me--

717
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,561
let me preach your word.

718
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,008
Let me shine your light,

719
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,567
'cause they're not all bad.

720
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:44,911
They can't all be bad.

721
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:51,854
Some can be saved, can't they?

722
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,685
Yes.

723
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,248
Some can be brought...

724
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,525
to heaven's holy gates
through your grace.

725
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:00,825
I have to believe that,

726
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:05,301
though I know most will swim
in the lake of fire forever.

727
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,600
If I can save a few...

728
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,933
even one...

729
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:17,436
then my life will have counted
for something.

730
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,282
I will have pulled my weight.

731
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,719
I will have earned my place
at your side.

732
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:29,123
I will have served a purpose
here on this earth.

733
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,683
Hello?

734
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,798
(Mrs. Carmody sniffles softly)

735
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,073
What?

736
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,375
I just need to use the bathroom.

737
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,437
Oh.

738
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,050
Okay. Well, then, have at it.

739
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,584
Ma'am...

740
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:05,528
I-- I just want you to know
that it's okay--

741
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,258
being scared, I mean--

742
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,891
and, well, if you need a friend--

743
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,401
you know, someone to talk to.

744
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,461
I have a friend--

745
00:41:14,537 --> 00:41:18,439
God up above.
I talk to him every day.

746
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,500
Don't you condescend to me.

747
00:41:20,577 --> 00:41:21,703
I'm sorry?

748
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,306
Not ever.
You don't mock me.

749
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,009
That's not what I was doing.

750
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,009
Well, I'll tell you what--

751
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,918
the day I need a friend like you,

752
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,049
I'll just have myself a little squat
and shit one out.

753
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,559
Maybe you do believe this.

754
00:41:42,632 --> 00:41:45,726
Maybe they're not lies,
they're delusions. Whatever.

755
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:49,034
Uh, the fact remains,
the evidence here is flimsy.

756
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,131
- It's bordering on ludicrous.
- Hey, this isn't a courtroom.

757
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,131
You're not arguing a case,

758
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,768
and you're doing nothing but damage,
talking the way you are.

759
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,837
And you can throw as much cow's blood
around the loading dock as you want to.

760
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,348
You still haven't fooled anyone.

761
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,474
OLLIE: Leave it alone, David.

762
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,245
You can't convince
some people there's a fire

763
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,310
even when their hair is burning.

764
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:05,878
Denial is a powerful thing.

765
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:06,945
Well, keep talking.

766
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,357
I'll have no part of it,
nor would any thinking person.

767
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:13,123
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.

768
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,132
There's no defense
against the will of God.

769
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,395
There's no court of appeals in hell.

770
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,869
There's no defense here, either.

771
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,168
Not even with all the fertilizer
in the world,

772
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,731
not even if you stack it
as high as you can.

773
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:28,334
It's still just bags of shit, isn't it?

774
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,403
Those of you who want to discuss
this thing rationally

775
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:34,508
to find a means of rescue
are welcome to join me.

776
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:37,247
Those who want to stack dog food,

777
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,879
knock yourselves out.

778
00:42:42,625 --> 00:42:44,957
We got those windows taped up
as best we could.

779
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,189
It should help.

780
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:47,594
Yeah, think so?

781
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:51,463
Duct tape and dog food bags.

782
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,002
That bad?

783
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,061
It's not good.

784
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,303
There's none so blind
as those who will not see.

785
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,170
Open your eyes.

786
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,510
Let the scales fall away.

787
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,573
This has all been written.

788
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,418
Revelations, chapter 15:

789
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,820
"And the temple was filled with smoke

790
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:16,052
"from the glory of God

791
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,525
"and from his power,

792
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,086
"and no one could enter the temple

793
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:23,156
until the seven plagues
of the seven angels were completed."

794
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,531
Well, what are you saying?

795
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:26,935
What are you proposing?

796
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,596
That we all prepare...

797
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,506
to meet our Maker.

798
00:43:31,574 --> 00:43:33,735
JIM: Oh, prepare to meet shit!

799
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,303
Lady, your tongue
must be hung in the middle

800
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,281
so that it can waggle at both ends.

801
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,113
MRS. CARMODY:
The end time has come,

802
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,948
not in flames, but in mist.

803
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,009
JIM: Come here!

804
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,214
MYRON: Easy! Back off!

805
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,315
How about if your ass prepares
to meet my size-10 work boot.

806
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,381
How about that?

807
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,950
Hey, there's no call for that.

808
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,588
Myron, please,
calm your friend down.

809
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:56,428
MRS. CARMODY: I'm trying
to save your soul, you stupid man.

810
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,695
- Doubters will doubt till the end.
- It's okay.

811
00:43:58,769 --> 00:43:59,827
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

812
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:02,497
A monstrosity did pull
that poor boy away.

813
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:06,440
Things in the mist--
do you doubt?

814
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,499
Do you?

815
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,013
Then go out.

816
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,447
Go out and say,
"How do you do."

817
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,506
Shut up, lady.

818
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,447
For God's sakes.

819
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,682
Look, you'll have to stop now.
You're scaring the children.

820
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,156
They should be scared.

821
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,921
Oh, yes, they should.

822
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:27,453
Their beautiful, pure little minds

823
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:30,022
have been corrupted with lies.

824
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,089
Lies.

825
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,261
All this talk of a modern God,

826
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,033
or no God.

827
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:37,767
There is one God.

828
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,502
The God of the Israelites.

829
00:44:39,575 --> 00:44:42,408
And he is a stern and vengeful God,

830
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,039
and we have been mocking him
far too long,

831
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:48,778
and now he demands
retribution in blood.

832
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,514
It is time to declare yourselves.

833
00:44:51,587 --> 00:44:53,248
Take sides--

834
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,154
the saved and the damned.

835
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:58,717
Read the Good Book.
It calls for expiation.

836
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:00,627
- Blood!
- What?

837
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,687
Blood.

838
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,561
Little Normie was first,

839
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:07,696
and now God calls the rest of us.

840
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,261
The bill is due.

841
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:10,829
It must be paid.

842
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,900
As Abraham prepared
to sacrifice his only son

843
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:15,467
to prove his love for God, so--

844
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:16,741
- Enough.
- (onlookers gasp)

845
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,354
- Ohh.
- Another down payment.

846
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:26,889
A few more pennies in the jar.

847
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,983
Now, that's nice, see.
I can't smack her, but it's okay for you.

848
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,391
I-I'm sorry everybody,

849
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:34,454
but this lady's perspective is
a little too Old Testament for my taste.

850
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,021
MRS. CARMODY:
They'll come for you.

851
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,558
Maybe tonight,
when darkness comes.

852
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:44,006
They'll come tonight,
and they'll take someone else.

853
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,065
See if they don't.

854
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,872
And when they do,

855
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,573
you will cry to God,

856
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:54,311
and you will beg Mother Carmody
to show you the way.

857
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,715
OLLIE: That's fine.

858
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:59,051
But until then,
if you don't shut up,

859
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:01,114
I'll wrap this tape around your mouth.

860
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,523
You just try it, Ollie Weeks.

861
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,085
And you, bitch...

862
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,053
you hit me again...

863
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,226
if you dare.

864
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,897
You'll be on your knees to me
before this is through.

865
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:22,442
Those of you who aren't local
should know

866
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:25,346
that Mrs. Carmody
is known in town for being...

867
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,405
unstable.

868
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,885
No shit.
What was your first clue?

869
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,447
SOLDIER: Shh.

870
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,324
Hi.

871
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,555
What's up, little dude?

872
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:41,428
How come your friends
don't come get us?

873
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:42,988
They got tanks and stuff, right?

874
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,833
Why can't you just call 'em?

875
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,063
Phones don't work.

876
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,900
But don't you got, like, a radio?

877
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,462
Hey, champ, what's going on?

878
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,668
I want their friends
to come rescue us.

879
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,734
They would if they could, pal.
They're stuck here just like us.

880
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:55,801
But--

881
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,744
Shh. Now, guys, we could use
a hand over there.

882
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:58,804
SOLDIER: Yeah, sure thing.

883
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,315
SOLDIER #2:
Troop, off your asses.

884
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,444
- DAVID: You all right?
- I don't like that scary lady.

885
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,852
Oh, man, I don't either.

886
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,390
But you know what?

887
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,189
Maybe she's scared too.

888
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,184
You think?

889
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,720
You think Mommy's okay?

890
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:18,064
(sighs)
Billy...

891
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,099
I'm sorry about the times
I was bad to her.

892
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,162
Aw, hey.

893
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,336
Mommy loves you very much.

894
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:29,902
And I'll bet she's fine.

895
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,739
And I promise you,

896
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:36,980
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get us back to her.

897
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:39,953
- Okay?
- 'Kay.

898
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,457
- Yeah?
- 'Kay.

899
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,293
So, we can use the charcoal fluid
and the mops

900
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,694
to make torches.

901
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,629
And we've got knives and stuff,
God knows.

902
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,100
This may be
a silly question, Bud, but...

903
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,934
do you happen to have
a gun in the store?

904
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:57,770
Here? No. Please.

905
00:47:57,841 --> 00:47:59,570
This-- this isn't Los Angeles.

906
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:01,303
I've got a shotgun in my truck.

907
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,137
I could try for it if you want.

908
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,478
Oh, God, I don't think that'd be
a good idea, Mr. Cornell.

909
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,539
Hold on.

910
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,520
This gun, um...

911
00:48:11,587 --> 00:48:13,487
my husband's idea.

912
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,548
He's away on business a lot.

913
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:16,786
It's not even loaded.

914
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,487
Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am.

915
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:19,550
AMANDA: Um...

916
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,666
DAVID:
You know how to use that?

917
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,327
Well, I shot it once on a pistol range.

918
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,893
Hit the target a few times.

919
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,500
So, we got a gun.

920
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,509
Anybody know how to shoot it?

921
00:48:33,576 --> 00:48:34,941
Well, I mean?

922
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,001
I do.

923
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:39,771
You?

924
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,683
(scoffs)
Ollie. Please.

925
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,925
Some target shooting.

926
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,188
State champion in '94.

927
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,127
- MAN: You're crazy if you go out there!
- NORTON: Let us pass!

928
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,131
Let us pass, please!

929
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,188
Let's just talk this thing through.

930
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,428
NORTON: We have, and we've
made our decision. We're leaving.

931
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,529
Hey, Mr. Mackey's gonna barbecue
some chicken on the gas grill.

932
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,938
- Why don't we just sit down and just--
- What, and let you keep on talking?

933
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:07,101
No, I've been in far too many
courtrooms to fall for that.

934
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,304
You've already psyched out
half a dozen of my people already.

935
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,368
AMANDA: Your people?

936
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,278
What kind of talk is that?
They're people, that's all.

937
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,782
Now-- now listen, everyone.

938
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,842
We are experiencing
some kind of disaster.

939
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,911
I don't know whether
it's man-made or natural,

940
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:22,891
but I do know that
it's definitely not supernatural

941
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,258
or biblical,
and, no offense, Mrs. Carmody,

942
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,956
but the only way
we're gonna help ourselves

943
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,691
is to seek rescue.

944
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:31,556
We're going out.

945
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,296
- Brent, look.
- I'm not discussing this any further.

946
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,534
I know. I just want to ask a favor.

947
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,733
Tie this around your waist.

948
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:42,972
What for?

949
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,139
It'll let us know you got
at least 300 feet.

950
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:48,373
I'll do it.

951
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,420
Are you throwing in with them?

952
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,581
Me? No thanks.

953
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,148
I think your man there
is a little too tightly wound.

954
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,421
Gonna get somebody killed.

955
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,293
But I'm thinkin' we could use
that shotgun of yours.

956
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,026
I saw where you parked
when I pulled in.

957
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,262
Red pickup, right?
Far entrance?

958
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,327
Son, you got brass balls.

959
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,103
The shells are
in the glove compartment.

960
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,163
Drive it back.

961
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:15,873
All right.

962
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,607
Just see they're paying out this line.

963
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,876
Line's up, I'll cut her loose,

964
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,440
just so you understand.

965
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,507
DAVID: Yeah.

966
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,459
You sure there's no way
I can talk you out of this?

967
00:50:32,528 --> 00:50:33,517
David...

968
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,796
there's nothing out there.
Nothing in the mist.

969
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,859
What if you're wrong?

970
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:42,427
Then, I guess...

971
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:47,466
the joke would be on me after all.

972
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,011
We're gonna send back help.

973
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,484
You'll die out there.
All of you.

974
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,430
Hey, crazy lady,
I believe in God too.

975
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:16,097
I just don't think
he's the bloodthirsty asshole

976
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:17,504
you make him out to be.

977
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,304
Well, you take that up with the devil
when you run into him.

978
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:21,901
You just chat it over at your leisure.

979
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,554
Well, let's strike out
toward the center of town.

980
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:52,868
Keep it loose.

981
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:10,315
DAVID: Nice and easy.

982
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:11,655
OLLIE: (low)
Keep going.

983
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,631
(onlookers murmur)

984
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,301
JIM: Look.

985
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,745
It's going.

986
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,980
They're doing good.

987
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,582
Aah! Aaahhhh!

988
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,819
(onlookers screaming)

989
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,189
(cord whistles sharply)

990
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,267
MAN: Put it down!

991
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,605
Ohh! Pull!

992
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,914
MAN: Oh, my God!
I'm slippin'!

993
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,748
Pull! Back up! Back up!
Back up!

994
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:22,097
(onlookers scream and shout)

995
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:23,154
Get it off!

996
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:33,565
Oh, my God.

997
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,209
(woman sobbing)

998
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:41,750
- JIM: Aw, sh--
- MRS. CARMODY: Blood!

999
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,547
Awww, sh--!

1000
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,281
MRS. CARMODY'
Oh, my God!

1001
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:48,754
- (onlookers shouting)
- Oh, my God!

1002
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,057
(onlookers screaming)

1003
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,570
Cut the rope!

1004
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:08,276
Shut the door!

1005
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,075
Now do you see?

1006
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,578
Now do you believe?
