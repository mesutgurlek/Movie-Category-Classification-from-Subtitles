Preacher on radio: reckless sinful
way throughout this life.

4
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:47,911
The Lord has told me

5
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,245
that the open
gates of Hell

6
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:52,978
are yawning up
widely in our path.

7
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:54,883
Yes, the flames

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,013
of perpetual damnation

9
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,025
are ever ready to grasp
our souls.

10
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,187
We know the way
of the righteous man.

11
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:05,287
Yeah, we know the prayer

12
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,992
of the righteous man.

13
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:19,540
I'm telling you
that the Lord has spoken.

14
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:22,706
Yes, the Lord has spoken
to me.

[bell rings]

16
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:48,635
Hi.

17
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:50,733
Mike Enslin.
Checking in.

18
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:53,301
Honey.
Mr. Enslin.

19
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:54,903
We were afraid you
weren't going to show.

20
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:57,643
Oh it's such an honor
to have you here.

21
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:59,548
- Terrible night out there.
- If I could just get the key,

22
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:01,280
I'll settle in and we can
talk in the morning after...

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,413
You probably want to hear
all about our haunted history.

24
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,753
Well, this staircase here,
this is where the maid

25
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,089
reputedly hung herself
in 1860.

26
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,560
- Oh.
- There's a picture!

27
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:11,085
- Can we do this in the morning?
- Wait wait.

28
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,995
It's printed in
our brochure.

29
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,522
- Did we send you one of these?
- Uh, probably did.

30
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:17,262
- Do you see her in the window?
- Yeah, there she is.

31
00:02:17,302 --> 00:02:20,294
That's a photo that
a guest took in 1986.

32
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:22,307
In your letter
you mentioned that the rooms

33
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,309
with the most
paranormal activity

34
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:26,368
were in the attic.
Could I have one of those rooms?

35
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,880
That's right, because the attic
is on the third floor

36
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:31,041
which is the former
servant's quarters.

37
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,517
People say that all
of Sylvia's children

38
00:02:33,552 --> 00:02:36,419
died up there
of tuberculosis.

39
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:39,288
- All of them?
- Guests have reported strange sounds.

40
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:41,918
At the stroke of midnight
there's been weird noises.

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,588
Now our best advice
is to lock your door from the inside.

42
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,291
- Isn't that right, honey?
- That's right.

43
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:48,891
You take care, you just
lock it from the inside.

44
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:50,663
I will.

45
00:02:50,702 --> 00:02:52,533
As soon as you
give me the key.

46
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:55,701
[laughs]

47
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:58,107
I'm so... right.
Got it right here.

48
00:02:58,143 --> 00:03:01,044
- Number 14, you can't miss it.
- Been a long drive.

49
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,048
- Good luck.
- All right, we'll see

50
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,209
what the night brings.

Mike:
Mrs. Clark, the proprietor,

56
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:20,585
says she hasn't
slept a night

57
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:23,459
since acquiring the inn
and I believe her.

58
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,827
No no no,
I pity her.

59
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:28,526
But in any case, the eggs
Benedict are delicious

60
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,694
and if you call in advance,
Mrs. Clark says

61
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:34,297
she will bake her famous
flourless chocolate cake.

62
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:38,332
On a Shiver Scale, I award the Weeping
Beach Inn six skulls.

63
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,472
Screw 'em, five skulls.

64

- Hi.
- Oh hey.

67
00:04:57,763 --> 00:05:00,425
How's it going?
Can I help you?

68
00:05:00,465 --> 00:05:01,898
Yeah, I'm here
for the big event.

69
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:05,700
All right.
Cool.

70
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:07,068
I'm Mike Enslin.

71
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:09,198
Sorry?

72
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,941
- Book signing.
- Oh, right.

73
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:15,435
Oh, that's you, yeah.
I see the resemblance, yeah.

74
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,539
- That's a good picture.
- Thanks, man.

75
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,141
All right, hold on.

76
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:22,312
Um... attention,
book lovers.

77
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:25,812
Tonight we have noted
occult writer

78
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:27,688
Michael Enslin

79
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:30,456
at the Author's Corner
tonight.

80
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,760
He's the writer of the best-selling
ghost survival guides,

81
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:37,132
um... with such titles
as "10 Haunted Hotels,"

82
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,297
"10 Haunted Graveyards,"

83
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,897
"10 Haunted Lighthouses."

84
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,374
That's tonight, 7:00 pm.

85
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:46,673
Mike: Anyway, so I really
enjoyed writing it,

86
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:48,646
and that's kind of
a history of the book.

87
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,774
And I hope you enjoy it,
or enjoyed it.

88
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:54,308
Uh, you know,
stay scared.

89
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,752
Right?
Any questions?

90
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:58,085
Where's the scariest place
you've ever been?

91
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:00,250
Scariest place
I've ever been?

92
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:02,283
Uh, I've never heard
that question before.

93
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:04,522
- That's a joke.
- [chuckles]

94
00:06:04,563 --> 00:06:06,895
Well, all these places have
very colorful histories.

95
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:08,490
Um...

96
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:10,626
I would say, if I had to
pick a top one,

97
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,660
I would say
Bar Harbor,

98
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:15,730
the site of the grisly
McTeig wedding night murders.

99
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:18,470
That's an intense place.
Or maybe St. Cloud, Minnesota,

100
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,411
where the crazed war widow
threw her baby down a well.

101
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:23,778
I mean, those all have a lot
of... I mean, it's thick.

102
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:26,613
- The air is thick.
- What about poltergeists?

103
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:29,519
Look, I'm a good researcher.
I go into every gig locked and loaded.

104
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:32,785
I travel with an EMF meter,
full-range spectrometer,

105
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:35,520
infrared camera. I mean, look,
nothing would make me happier

106
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,494
than to experience
a paranormal event,

107
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,259
you know, to get a glimpse
of the elusive light

108
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,664
at the end of the tunnel.

109
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,531
[thunder crashes]

110
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:45,866
So you're saying there's
no such thing as ghosts?

111
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:48,666
I'm saying
I've never seen one,

112
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:51,073
but they're awful convenient
for desperate hotels

113
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:53,304
- when the interstate moves away.
- [knocking]

114
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:56,041
This thing has really
gone off the rails. Who has a pen?

115
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,641
- I do.
- Which one?

116
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,915
Uh, but seriously, Mike,
if I want to see a real live ghost,

117
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:03,716
where's my best bet?

118
00:07:03,755 --> 00:07:05,052
- Guaranteed?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,648
Haunted Mansion,
Orlando.

120
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,887
Awesome, thanks.

121
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:11,487
- Stay scared.
- Thank you.

122
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,361
Cashier:
Hey, Ray, can you lock up?

123
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:16,333
I got band practice tonight.

124
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:17,995
Holy shit.

125
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,526
What rock did you
find that under?

126
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:21,596
- Um, eBay.
- eBay, huh?

127
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,665
- [girl laughs]
- How much did it go for?

128
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,234
Well, there weren't
many bidders.

129
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,712
I would think not.

130
00:07:28,747 --> 00:07:31,716
- Wow.
- But it's, um...

131
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,479
- an amazing book.
- Oh.

132
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:36,282
Um, so... unique

133
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:39,256
and inspirational
and honest.

134
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,986
Thanks.
What's your name?

135
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:43,051
- Um, Anna.
- Okay, Anna.

136
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,188
Are you gonna write another
one like this one?

137
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,061
Nah, it's
a different guy.

138
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,067
Um...

139
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,069
- can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

140
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,436
Um, the relationship
in the book

141
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:57,169
with the father and the son...
it's probably too personal,

142
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:00,804
- but, um, it's so authentic and...
- Mm-hm.

143
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:03,406
well-constructed,
and...

144
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:06,349
is it true?

145
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,013
No.

146
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:11,215
Well, thank you for this.
I really appreciate it.

147
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:12,621
My pleasure.

148
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:14,215
Bye.

Just a minute, Tiffany!

152
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:37,577
Yeah, I'm just gonna tie it
inside my suit here.

Yo, Greg, check him out!

Woman:
Did you see what happened?

156
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:41,943
Oh yeah.

157
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:45,806
Are you okay, buddy?

158
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,843
- Hey, are you breathing?

162
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:05,997
We got 325.
That is back here, I think.

163
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:07,800
Uh-huh.

164
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,637
This is the one.
Sign on the line, please, sir.

165
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:12,233
Oh, you mean
right here?

166
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:15,110
- Have yourself a beautiful day.
- Thank you.

167
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:17,410
- Thank you very much.
- Hey, man, you've been gone a while.

168
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:19,747
- Hey, Jackson, what's up?
- Oh by the way, dude,

169
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:22,753
I read your last book...
the "10 Haunted Mansions" thing.

170
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:24,379
Man, that's some
scary shit.

171
00:10:24,422 --> 00:10:26,720
Cool.

172
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:28,385
Later on, dude.

173
00:10:28,426 --> 00:10:32,157
[soft rock playing]

174
00:10:32,197 --> 00:10:33,789
- Hi.
- Hi, how you doing?

175
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:35,993
- Hi.
- Good.

176
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:37,865
Thanks.

177
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:46,433
[customers chatting]

178
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:26,546
That's cute.

179
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,782
Woman: Good evening,
Dolphin Hotel.

180
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:31,345
How might I direct
your call?

181
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:33,254
Mike:
Yeah, hi, I'm calling about room 1408.

182
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,054
One moment please, sir.

183
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:38,426
Man:
How may I help you?

184
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:40,954
Yeah, I'd like to stay in
room 1408 please.

185
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:44,457
That room is
unavailable, sir.

186
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:46,834
I didn't tell you
which date.

187
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,106
How about Saturday?

188
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:51,904
It's unavailable.

189
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:56,878
[laughs]
The following Tuesday?

190
00:11:56,915 --> 00:11:58,644
Unavailable.

191
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:00,446
Next month?

192
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:01,952
Unavailable.

193
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,182
Next summer?

194
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:06,213
[hangs up]

195
00:12:30,148 --> 00:12:33,049
Man: Somebody, anybody,
where's good Chinese near 48th?

196
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:35,382
I got to have lunch with
that idiot from Random House. Anybody?

197
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,411
Sam, Mike Enslin calling
from Los Angeles again.

198
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,855
I'll take it in there.

199
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:41,324
Clay, you got a sec for
Mike Enslin?

200
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,826
- Say yes.
- Yes.

201
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:45,386
Great. Now look, this guy
tends to get a little morose,

202
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,694
so try to keep the energy up.
Otherwise he stews in his own funk.

203
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:49,029
- Mike!
- Mike: Hey, Sam.

204
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,194
Hey hey, read the first
five chapters last night.

205
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:52,863
Spooky shit,
couldn't sleep a wink.

206
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:54,838
Great. Hey, did you take care
of that thing?

207
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:57,842
You'd better believe I did.
And I got our top lawyer here right now.

208
00:12:57,876 --> 00:12:59,002
Mike, Clay,
Clay, Mike.

209
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,272
- Hi, Clay.
- Mike.

210
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:02,176
Talk fast, all right?
This guy's $400 an hour.

211
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:03,703
All right, Clay,
what's up with the Dolphin?

212
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:05,147
Yeah, the Dolphin.

213
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:07,743
That stick-up-its-ass
relic on Lexington.

214
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,811
Too posh for
a free plug, right?

215
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:12,118
Well, you are gonna love
what Clay's cooked up.

216
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:14,682
He dug around and found you...
are you sitting down?

217
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:17,160
- a Federal
Civil Rights law.

218
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:19,220
Like somebody would
discriminate against you,

219
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:22,358
a well-to-do white guy.
But the law's the law, right, Clay?

220
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,061
Ergo, if the room's
not occupied

221
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:26,070
- they have to give it to you.
- Really?

222
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:28,368
Yeah. Now look, the manager there's
gonna put up a stink

223
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:29,634
but he knows the drill.

224
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:31,073
- Nothing you can't handle.
- So, Mike...

225
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:32,633
we'll book the room
and if they refuse

226
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:34,542
we'll rattle our sabers
and file suit.

227
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:37,047
- So it's all done?
- Thanks, Clay. Get lost, all right?

228
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,141
Bye, Clay.

229
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:41,516
Yeah, Mike,
are you there?

230
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:44,920
Yeah, uh, on a more
personal note,

231
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:46,480
are you sure
you want to come here?

232
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:49,391
Yeah, of course. It'll make a solid
closing chapter of the book.

233
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:52,123
Yeah yeah,
I know the routine.

234
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:55,155
But, I mean,
it's New York.

235
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,101
All that happened... you really want
to put yourself through that?

236
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:00,434
- I'll be quick.
- Are you gonna call Lily?

237
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,441
No.
I don't want to impose.

238
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,569
In and out.
Nobody gets hurt.

239
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,344
It's just a job.

240

Woman: It's a beautiful room,
with fabulous views of the city.

245
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:50,645
Pardon me, ladies.

246
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:05,569
Man:
Thanks very much.

247
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:07,093
Welcome to
the Dolphin, sir.

248
00:15:07,138 --> 00:15:09,106
- Are you checking in?
- Mike Enslin.

249
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,368
One night.

250
00:15:10,408 --> 00:15:12,899
And how are we
spelling that today?

251
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:15,208
- N-S-L-l-N?
- N-S-L-l-N.

252
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:16,440
Yeah.

253
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,250
Uh, would you excuse me
for a moment, sir?

254
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:26,018
Sure.

255
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:32,153
Mr. Dempsey, Mike Enslin's
just checked in.

256
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,665
- Where is he?
- He's over at my desk.

257
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:37,099
That's fine, Marie.
I'll take care of it.

258
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:38,500
Okay.

259
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:45,899
It'll just be a minute,
Mr. Enslin.

260
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,639
[baby crying]

261
00:15:50,982 --> 00:15:53,314
Good evening, sir.
Can I help you with your bag?

262
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:55,819
- No.
- Very well.

263
00:15:57,722 --> 00:16:00,384
Mr. Enslin,
I'm Gerald Olin,

264
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:02,188
manager of
the Dolphin.

265
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:05,162
If there's anything that I can do
for you while you're here...

266
00:16:05,196 --> 00:16:07,460
dinner reservations,
theater tickets,

267
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:09,227
maybe a Knicks game?
Anything...

268
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:11,258
just tell me.
I am at your service.

269
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:14,430
Well, if I can just get the key to 1408,
I can get out of your hair.

270
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:18,203
Oh, we were thinking
of upgrading you to a penthouse suite.

271
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,768
1408, please.

272
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,939
Insistent,
aren't we?

273
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:24,846
Could you please
humor me

274
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:28,876
by coming to my office for a more
private conversation?

275
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,320
- Sure.
- Excellent.

276
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:37,860
Come in.
Make yourself comfortable.

277
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:41,428
1408 a smoking room?

278
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:43,764
As a matter of fact,
it is. Yes.

279
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:47,202
Good, one less worry in
the watches of the night.

280
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:49,172
Care for a cigar?

281
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:51,334
No thank you,
I don't smoke.

282
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:53,139
Oh this, yeah.
That's...

283
00:16:53,177 --> 00:16:55,611
in case nuclear war
breaks out.

284
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,807
I gave it up
a long time ago.

285
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:58,713
It's part habit,
part superstition.

286
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,115
It's, you know,
a writer thing.

287
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:01,914
You do drink,
don't you?

288
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:03,716
Of course, I just said
I was a writer.

289
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:07,054
Le Cinquante Sept
Deces, 1939.

290
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:08,888
Exquisite.

291
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,122
About $800 a bottle,
when you can find it.

292
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:14,029
I appreciate the bribe,
but I intend on staying in that room.

293
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,392
- How long?
- How long?

294
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:20,030
My usual is
overnight.

295
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:22,039
I see.

296
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:24,906
No one's ever lasted
more than an hour.

297
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,877
[laughs]
Jesus, man.

298
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,970
You ought to shave your eyebrows
and paint your hair gold

299
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:31,504
if you're gonna try
to sell that spookhouse bullshit.

300
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:32,982
Otherwise, you'll
scare the children.

301
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:35,076
Why are you mocking me
when I am genuinely,

302
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,314
to the best of my ability,
trying to help you?

303
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:39,084
No, you're playing
a little game.

304
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:41,353
You're selling
the mystique.

305
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:43,792
But eventually,
we both know

306
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:46,353
you're gonna give me the key
and I'm gonna go up to the room

307
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:49,093
and I'm gonna write my story
and your bookings are gonna go up 50%.

308
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:52,466
Do you mind if my little friend records
our conversation?

309
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:56,672
I'll take that as a yes.

310
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,109
Sir, you quite
misunderstand the situation.

311
00:18:00,144 --> 00:18:03,443
Now, I know the Dolphin
doesn't have the cachet of the Plaza

312
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,176
or the Carlyle,

313
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:08,344
but we operate
at 90% capacity.

314
00:18:08,386 --> 00:18:09,546
Always.

315
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:12,249
And my concern here
is not for the hotel.

316
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,815
My concern here
is not for you.

317
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:17,123
Frankly, selfishly,

318
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:20,130
I don't want you
to check into 1408

319
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:22,496
because I don't want
to clean up the mess.

320
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:25,934
Now hotels are all
about presentation

321
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,530
and fertile
creature comforts.

322
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:31,542
My training is
as a manager,

323
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:33,544
not a coroner.

324
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:36,877
Under my watch there have
been four deaths... four.

325
00:18:36,914 --> 00:18:39,474
After the last one,
I forbade any guest

326
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:41,781
from checking
into 1408 ever again.

327
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:45,152
The last one was David Hide,
orthodontist, manic-depressive.

328
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:47,316
Slit his wrist,
did a little self-surgery,

329
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:48,825
turned himself into
a eunuch, right?

330
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,351
Yes. So you've
done your homework.

331
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,522
I'm a professional too.

332
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:55,464
Well, grievously, in its
95-year existence,

333
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,900
the hotel has seen
seven jumpers,

334
00:18:57,935 --> 00:18:59,960
four overdoses,
five hangings,

335
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:01,232
- three mutilations...
- Three mutilations...

336
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:02,967
two stranglings.
General manager Gerald Olin

337
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:05,134
is well-versed in
the hotel's tragic history,

338
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:07,974
dryly reciting the docket
of carnage like a bookkeeper

339
00:19:08,012 --> 00:19:09,741
discussing his ledger.

340
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,840
Well, you think
you're clever, don't you?

341
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:13,214
I know the game.

342
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:14,650
Well, during
your investigation,

343
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:17,176
did you discover
the 22 natural deaths

344
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:19,212
that have occurred
in 1408?

345
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:22,323
Natural deaths?

346
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,692
Ah, didn't find out
about them

347
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:28,256
because the newspapers don't
print anything about them.

348
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:31,632
Hmm. All told,
there have been 56 deaths

349
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:33,102
in 1408.

350
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:36,368
56?
You're shitting me.

351
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:38,204
You don't know anything.

352
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:41,268
The causes of death
in 1408 range

353
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:43,746
from heart attack,
stroke, drowning...

354
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:46,477
- Drowning?
- Yes, one Mr. Grady Miller

355
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:48,644
drowned
in his chicken soup.

356
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:51,052
That's hard to do.
How... how did he do that?

357
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:52,681
How indeed?

358
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:55,715
Interesting.
It's all in here.

359
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,127
I will let you have this
and give you access to my office.

360
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:01,495
You can take notes,
put it all in your book.

361
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,727
My only condition

362
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:07,465
is that you do not
stay in that room.

363
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:10,201
You'll let me look
at all that stuff?

364
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:12,232
Hmm.

365
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:22,920
I never did
get that drink.

366
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:29,091
[corks pops]

367
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,872
- Oh, that is good.
- Here, keep it.

368
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:46,934
Compliments
of the house.

369
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:00,251
- I'm still staying.
- Damn it to hell!

370
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,191
I'm sorry.

371
00:21:02,226 --> 00:21:05,286
All right here.
Here, read the godforsaken thing.

372
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:07,422
I guarantee you,
once you've read it

373
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:09,831
you won't want to stay
in 1408.

374
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:14,066
The first victim:
Mr. Kevin O'Malley,

375
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:15,902
sewing machine salesman.

376
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,805
Checked into the hotel
the first week it opened...

377
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:20,777
- October, 1912.
- Cut his own throat, right?

378
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:22,369
Oh, that's not
the horrific part.

379
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:24,438
Afterwards, in a fit
of insanity,

380
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:26,916
he tried to stitch
himself back together

381
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:29,385
using an old sewing needle
before he bled to death.

382
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,115
Easy, man.

383
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:34,147
Look, Mr. Enslin,
you don't have to stay in 1408.

384
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,217
You can take
photographs of 1404.

385
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,787
It has the exact same layout and no one
will ever know the difference.

386
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,492
- My readers expect the truth.
- Your readers?

387
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:45,331
Your readers expect
grotesqueries

388
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:47,530
and cheap thrills.

"The Barking Phantom
of Mount Hope Cemetery."

A direct quote...
how'd you know that?

393
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:59,144
Your books aren't
hard to find.

394
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:01,048
They're on the bargain
shelves

395
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:03,815
of any paperback
novel store;

396
00:22:03,854 --> 00:22:07,381
full of cynicism,
written by a talented, intelligent man

397
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:10,087
who doesn't believe
in anything or anyone but himself.

398
00:22:10,127 --> 00:22:13,028
Guilty as charged.

399
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:15,862
Hey listen, this meeting's over.
Why don't you give me the room?

400
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,391
Oh please, don't act
like a hurt schoolgirl.

401
00:22:18,436 --> 00:22:21,496
- In fact, you surprised me.
- Oh.

402
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,372
You are not
the hack-n-slash I expected.

403
00:22:24,408 --> 00:22:27,002
I rather liked the first one,
the hardcover.

404
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:30,741
What was it called?
"The Last Walk..."

405
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:32,078
"Long Road Home."

406
00:22:32,116 --> 00:22:35,085
"The Long Road Home,"
yes.

407
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,587
I rather thought
the father was a bastard.

408
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,522
Yeah, he was.

409
00:22:39,557 --> 00:22:41,582
Um...

410
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,093
Iook man, just
give me the key.

411
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:46,221
- Mr. Enslin...
- Just give me the key!

412
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,290
Listen, I stayed
at the Bigsby house.

413
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,268
I brushed my goddamn teeth
right next to the tub

414
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:54,601
where Sir David Smith
drowned his whole family.

415
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,608
And I stopped being afraid
of vampires when I was 12.

416
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:01,203
Do you know why I can stay
in your spooky old room, Mr. Olin?

417
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:04,043
Because I know that
ghoulies and ghosties

418
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:06,379
and long-legged beasties
don't exist.

419
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:09,008
Even if they did,

420
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:11,647
there's no God to protect
us from them, is there?

421
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,382
So I can't talk you
out of this?

422
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:17,986
I think we've reached
an understanding.

423
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,463
Very well.

424
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:23,058

That's a nice touch... it's antiquey.

We have magnetic cards also, but
electronics don't seem to work in 1408.

Oh, I'm sorry.

No, you misunderstand.

Whatever's in 1408
is nothing like that.

436
00:23:57,868 --> 00:24:00,666
Then what is it?

there's no 13th floor.

it's got to be filthy.

I mean, the sheets haven't been changed
in what? 11 years?

her out, she was...

her eyes out.

You got to be kidding me.

484

Round one goes to the hideous Mr. Olin
for effective aggressiveness.

485
00:28:45,456 --> 00:28:48,789
I have to admit,
he had me going for a moment.

486
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,893
But where is
the bone-chilling terror?

487
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,694
Show me the rivers
of blood.

488
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:04,140
It's just a room.

This room is evil.

Mike's voice: Olin said hotels are about
fertile creature comforts.

494
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:00,326
It's a good line,
but I wonder

495
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:03,162
whether they're really
about reassuring platitudes,

496
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,691
a prosaic sense
of the familiar.

00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:14,800
There's a sofa,

00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:18,337
a writing desk,
a faux antique armoire,

501
00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:20,509
floral wallpaper.

502
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:22,917
Carpet's unremarkable,
except for a stain

503
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:26,150
beneath a thrift-store painting
of a schooner lost at sea.

504
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,489
The work is done in the
predictably dull fashion

505
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:31,391
of Currier & lves.

506
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:33,919
The second painting
is of an old woman

507
00:30:33,964 --> 00:30:36,194
reading bedtime stories...
a Whistler knockoff...

508
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:37,996
to a group
of deranged children

509
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:41,732
as another Madonna and child
watch from the background.

510
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:45,435
It does have
the vague air of menace.

511
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:49,537
The third and final
painfully dull painting

512
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,571
is the ever-popular
"The Hunt."

513
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:54,243
Horses, hounds
and constipated British lords.

514
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:57,344
Some smartass spoke about
the banality of evil.

515
00:30:57,387 --> 00:30:59,446
If that's true,

516
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,254
then we're in
the seventh circle of Hell.

The panorama is typically cramped
New York City view of nothing:

Dull, grey

That is very unsettling.

That means

I turn around, go to
the bed for the chocolate.

00:32:51,401 --> 00:32:53,369
Then I go into the closet
which would have...

It would have let

[ringing continues]

642
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:19,432
- Hello?
- Woman: Sir, I'm afraid there was

643
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:21,334
a miscommunication
in the kitchen.

644
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:23,532
There's going to be a 10-minute delay
with your sandwich.

645
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:24,699
Sandwich?
What sandwich?

646
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:26,606
I didn't order any sandwich.
What are you talking about?

647
00:42:26,643 --> 00:42:28,133
I'm sorry.
You're welcome to substitute

648
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,146
a side dish for
your French fries.

We have cottage cheese,
macaroni salad,

- coleslaw...
- Listen to me. You win.

651
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:36,151
I'm checking out.
I'm hurt.

652
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:38,416
Do you understand?
My goddamn hand is hurt.

653
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:41,219
I understand. If you leave your dry
cleaning out by 10:00 AM,

654
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:43,384
we'll have it pressed
and returned by 5:00...

655
00:42:43,426 --> 00:42:45,724
Shit, bitch! Call me a cab
to the nearest hospital!

656
00:42:45,762 --> 00:42:48,697
I'm hurt! Do you comprehend
what I'm telling you?

657
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:51,894
Sir, I will not tolerate you speaking
to me in that tone of voice.

658
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:54,870
You're an idiot!
I'm gonna sue your ass!

659
00:42:54,904 --> 00:42:57,338
I'm gonna take legal action!
What's wrong with you?

660
00:42:57,373 --> 00:43:00,604
If you wish, I can connect you
with our manager Mr. Olin.

661
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:02,770
Good! Good good good
good good! Put him on.

662

Put him on. I'm gonna blitz

Man's voice: When staying at
the Dolphin, be certain to enjoy

666
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:14,156
New York's finest dining at the fabled
Sea Bream restaurant

667
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,351
on our mezzanine level.
Muscles tense?

668
00:43:16,392 --> 00:43:18,860
Then make an appointment
to visit our deluxe spa

Get up. Get up.

710
00:47:16,065 --> 00:47:17,623
You're losing the plot.

You're losing
the whole goddamn structure.

in Kansas.

There's a reason for everything.
Just think.

What's that?

719
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:50,458
What is that?
Is that a spycam?

720
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,027
Who is that?
Are you enjoying this?

721
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:56,971
Is that the sadistic owner
of the hotel or is that Olin?

722

Wait a minute.

Did he take a sip?

I can't remember.

He dosed me!

It was the booze
or the chocolates.

728
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,495
Never take candy
from strangers.

729

All right, all right.
I'm just hallucinating.

I've just got to
ride this out.

I've got to
ride this out

00:48:27,503 --> 00:48:29,994
for four or five hours
and I'm straight. Okay.

734
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:32,772
You can do this.

Lily:
Whatever you do, don't turn around.

I can't smell anything.

00:53:21,931 --> 00:53:24,593
you will be.

795

[woman laughing]

[panting]

797
00:53:45,955 --> 00:53:47,980
Mike's voice:
Maybe I'm not real.

798
00:53:50,426 --> 00:53:52,519
Maybe I'm just
having a nightmare...

799
00:53:55,064 --> 00:53:57,328
an incredibly vivid

800
00:53:57,366 --> 00:53:59,800
lucid nightmare.

801
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:04,898
When is the last time
I remember going to bed?

802
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,204
[ticking]

803
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,177
I flew in yesterday.

804
00:54:10,312 --> 00:54:13,611
Or was that... today?

805
00:54:14,617 --> 00:54:16,585
I can't remember.

806
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,610
Was I on a train?

807
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:23,853
I woke up somewhere

808
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,952
and I had breakfast.

809
00:54:25,995 --> 00:54:28,828
Where was I?
What did I eat?

810
00:54:33,135 --> 00:54:35,126
[rumbling]

811
00:54:36,805 --> 00:54:38,295
Here it comes.

812
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:04,293
They say you can't die
in your dreams.

813
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,857
Is that true?

814
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:17,011
[rumbles]

815
00:55:23,085 --> 00:55:25,280
[horns blaring]

816
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:28,813
The shock
would wake you up.

817
00:55:28,857 --> 00:55:30,791
[horn blaring]

818
00:55:33,395 --> 00:55:36,421
So you couldn't
really die.

819
00:55:41,003 --> 00:55:42,868
All right,
what are our options?

820
00:55:42,905 --> 00:55:46,363
Got the hallway,
got guest rooms on either side,

821
00:55:46,408 --> 00:55:49,502
stairwell,
fire exits.

822
00:55:49,545 --> 00:55:51,308
And that's
the next window...

823
00:55:52,748 --> 00:55:54,238
the next room.

824
00:55:55,718 --> 00:55:59,176
How many feet across
is that?

825
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:00,882
One...

826
00:56:00,923 --> 00:56:02,788
[rumbles]

827
00:56:02,825 --> 00:56:04,417
...three,

828
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:05,984
four, five,

829
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:10,055
six, seven, eight...

830
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:11,430
nine.

831
00:56:12,434 --> 00:56:15,335
Nine, nine...
18 feet across.

832
00:56:18,107 --> 00:56:21,235
Okay.
I can do this.

833
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:29,750
If something should happen,
if I should slip and fall,

834
00:56:29,785 --> 00:56:32,948
I want it to be known
that it was an accident.

835
00:56:34,123 --> 00:56:36,057
The room...

836
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:37,956
did not win.

837
00:56:39,495 --> 00:56:41,122
Okay.

838
00:56:41,163 --> 00:56:43,028
Okay, I can do this.

839
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,199
18 little steps.

840
00:56:54,176 --> 00:56:56,144
Four...

841
00:56:56,178 --> 00:56:58,578
Don't look down.
Five...

842
00:56:59,848 --> 00:57:01,748
Keep moving.

843
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:08,020
Here we go.

844
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:16,392
All right.
Okay.

845
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,093
Number nine...

846
00:57:18,133 --> 00:57:19,657
eight...

847
00:57:21,537 --> 00:57:22,902
six...

848
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:29,277
Where is it?
Where is it?

849
00:57:32,548 --> 00:57:35,847

Get ahold of yourself.

860

You're running to places
that aren't real.

[rewinding]

862
01:00:13,642 --> 01:00:15,803
Hotel rooms are naturally
creepy places.

863
01:00:19,948 --> 01:00:22,746
Strangely, the bedroom
has no window.

864

[sobbing]

870
01:00:44,473 --> 01:00:47,704
No. No. Doctors don't
know everything.

871
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,711
We can get another opinion,
look for other treatment.

872
01:00:49,745 --> 01:00:52,111
- You hear about...
- Look at me.

873
01:00:52,147 --> 01:00:53,671
...miracle cures.
- Lily.

874
01:00:53,715 --> 01:00:56,980
Oh God.
Please, something.

875
01:00:57,019 --> 01:01:00,648
Mike: What kind of god would
do this to a little girl?

[Lily sobbing]

Katie:
Daddy, I can't see you.

Daddy, I can't find you.

Daddy, I'm scared.

- Katie.
- I'm scared, Daddy.

882
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:25,371
Help.

883
01:01:25,414 --> 01:01:27,143
Help me.

884
01:01:27,182 --> 01:01:29,047
Daddy, help me.

885
01:02:06,154 --> 01:02:08,019
Okay, how about
the wireless?

886
01:02:08,056 --> 01:02:09,546
Come on.

887
01:02:16,898 --> 01:02:19,230
Give me a signal.
Give me a signal.

888

- [beeps]
- Computer: Good evening, Mike.

Oh, yes!

- [beeps]
- Mike?

01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:31,973
Mike, is that...
is that you?

892
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:33,743
- I can barely see you.
- Yes yes.

893
01:02:33,782 --> 01:02:37,218
- It's like seeing a ghost.
- No no no. Yes, it's me.

894
01:02:37,252 --> 01:02:39,083
- It's me. It's Mike.
- This is a little bizarre.

895
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:41,248
I mean, I haven't talked
to you in a year

896
01:02:41,289 --> 01:02:43,348
and suddenly you pop up
in a box on my computer.

897
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,724
I'm sorry, Lily.
Listen to me, please, quickly.

898
01:02:45,761 --> 01:02:48,355
Look, I'm at work, okay? So why don't
you call me at home tonight?

899
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:51,889
I'm trapped in this room,
this place.

900
01:02:51,933 --> 01:02:54,128
Mike, you're always trapped in weird
places. That's your job.

901
01:02:54,169 --> 01:02:56,034
- No no, please, Lily. Listen to me.
- [phone rings]

- Please.
- Lily Enslin.

- Hi. Yeah yeah.
- Lily!

- I've got those. I'll be right down.
- No. Lily!

01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:04,342
Lily, please!
Call the cops.

906
01:03:04,379 --> 01:03:06,779
Send them
to the Dolphin Hotel.

907
01:03:06,815 --> 01:03:08,544
I'll call you back.

908
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,314
- You're in the city?
- Yes!

909
01:03:13,355 --> 01:03:15,846
- 2254 Lexington.
- What are you doing in New York?

910
01:03:15,891 --> 01:03:19,327
I'll tell you later.
The Dolphin Hotel, room 1408.

911
01:03:19,361 --> 01:03:21,329
- That's just perfect.
- Please.

912
01:03:21,363 --> 01:03:23,194
You walk out, you disappear.
Leaving me what?

913
01:03:23,231 --> 01:03:25,495
Not divorced. Separated?
I don't know, it's not clear.

914
01:03:25,534 --> 01:03:28,264
- Suddenly you need me?
- Lily, I'm in a real bad spot here.

915
01:03:28,303 --> 01:03:31,067
- I'm in danger. You understand?
- Okay, Mike. Slow down.

916
01:03:31,106 --> 01:03:32,334
You're not making
any sense.

917
01:03:32,374 --> 01:03:35,502
There's something trying
to kill me right now.

918
01:03:39,414 --> 01:03:41,177
No, Lily!

919

[mumbling]
That's the way out.

924
01:05:03,765 --> 01:05:05,824
Or that way.
Or that way.

925
01:05:08,837 --> 01:05:10,031
All right,
that's the way out.

[baby crying]

927

- Help! Help!
- Please, sleep.

- Lady, I'm coming through!
- Mike!

930
01:05:20,248 --> 01:05:23,411
Mike, can you help me?
Where'd you go?

931
01:05:23,451 --> 01:05:26,887
Mike: I got to get some cigarettes.
You want something?

I've got to go. I'll be in California.

Mike, you can't do this.

She needs you.
She lost a kid too.

936
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,568
You've got an amazing talent
for stating the obvious, Pop.

937
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:42,831
You think
I don't know that?

938
01:05:42,871 --> 01:05:44,862
I'm trying to talk
some sense into your head!

939
01:05:44,906 --> 01:05:47,670
- Don't put your hands on me, old man!
- Mike!

940
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:50,837
Talk? Why change what appears to be
the habit of a lifetime, Pop?

941
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:52,312
You were always great
at passing judgment,

942
01:05:52,347 --> 01:05:54,247
but the problem is
you never gave a shit.

943
01:05:54,282 --> 01:05:57,217
I never gave a shit
because you're a bullshit writer!

01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,121
Shit!

Alcohol.

958
01:08:26,868 --> 01:08:28,927
I was just checking to see
if the accommodations

959
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,562
are exceeding
your expectations.

960
01:08:30,605 --> 01:08:32,800
You know goddamn well
they are!

961
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:35,708
- What do you want from me?
- No no no.

962
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:38,076
What do you want?

963
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:40,809
What do you want,
Mr. Enslin?

964
01:08:40,849 --> 01:08:43,511
- You sought this room.
- It was a job. I was doing the job.

965
01:08:43,551 --> 01:08:45,576
- I beg your pardon?
- My job! I'm a writer.

966
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:48,589
Oh, that's right.
You don't believe in anything.

967
01:08:48,623 --> 01:08:50,318
You like shattering
people's hopes.

968
01:08:50,358 --> 01:08:51,655
Oh, that's bullshit!

969
01:08:51,693 --> 01:08:53,456
Why do you think people
believe in ghosts?

970
01:08:53,495 --> 01:08:55,861
For fun?
No.

971
01:08:55,897 --> 01:08:59,333
It's the prospect
of something after death.

972
01:08:59,367 --> 01:09:02,598
How many spirits
have you broken?

973
01:09:02,637 --> 01:09:04,434
Mike's voice:
She was in so much pain.

974
01:09:04,472 --> 01:09:06,531
Lily: I'm sure she's smiling down
on us right now.

975
01:09:06,574 --> 01:09:09,543
What do you want
from me?

976
01:09:09,577 --> 01:09:10,874
Huh?

977
01:09:10,912 --> 01:09:13,938
What do you want
from me?

978
01:09:13,982 --> 01:09:15,643
You...

979
01:09:16,651 --> 01:09:17,948
you little...

980
01:09:17,986 --> 01:09:20,955
[muttering]

981
01:09:20,989 --> 01:09:23,549
[yelling]
What do you want?

982
01:09:23,591 --> 01:09:25,582
What?!

983
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:32,430
I want my drink!

984
01:09:44,112 --> 01:09:46,842
You win.
You win.

985
01:09:54,522 --> 01:09:56,319
- Katie: Mommy?
- Lily: Hmm?

986
01:09:56,357 --> 01:09:58,587
Katie:
Why is the Bible purple?

987
01:09:58,626 --> 01:10:00,890
[chuckles]
I don't know why it's purple.

988
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:04,387
It was a wedding present.

989
01:10:04,432 --> 01:10:06,923
My grandmother brought it
all the way from Hungary.

990
01:10:06,968 --> 01:10:08,595
Someday it'll be yours.

991
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,936
Are there people
where I'm going?

992
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:23,111
Hey, you're not
going anywhere, kiddo.

993
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:24,743
You're gonna stay
right here with us.

994
01:10:24,786 --> 01:10:26,811
Daddy...

995
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:29,153
everyone dies.

996
01:10:30,758 --> 01:10:33,090
When they're old.

997
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:34,720
When they're much older.

998
01:10:34,762 --> 01:10:37,026
Okay, and then they go
to a better place.

999
01:10:37,065 --> 01:10:40,057
And it's beautiful there.

1000
01:10:41,202 --> 01:10:43,033
And all your friends
will be there.

1001
01:10:48,843 --> 01:10:50,572
Is God there?

1002
01:10:51,613 --> 01:10:52,739
Yes.

1003
01:10:54,382 --> 01:10:56,247
Do you really
believe that, Daddy?

1004
01:10:57,819 --> 01:10:59,582
Yes.

1005
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:04,081
Mike: You know what I think!
We should have done more!

1006
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:05,786
- We did everything we could!
- No, we didn't!

1007
01:11:05,827 --> 01:11:08,091
- We should have helped her fight...
- Oh my God.

1008
01:11:08,129 --> 01:11:10,359
...instead of filling her head full
of these stories

1009
01:11:10,398 --> 01:11:12,662
about heavens
and the clouds and nirvana

1010
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,531
and all that bullshit!

1011
01:11:14,569 --> 01:11:16,093
Those stories,
she like them.

1012
01:11:16,137 --> 01:11:17,968
I'm going to get
some cigarettes, okay?

1013
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:19,769
[phone ringing]

1014
01:12:55,703 --> 01:12:58,831
Mike's voice:
We ponder the situation.

1015
01:12:58,873 --> 01:13:02,206
I'm trying to
accurately describe...

1016
01:13:03,478 --> 01:13:06,106
Orpheus on
the Orpheum Circuit

1017
01:13:06,147 --> 01:13:08,138
bathed in tango light,

1018
01:13:08,182 --> 01:13:11,447
the kind of light
that makes the dead...

1019
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,915
get out of their graves
and tango.

1020
01:13:14,956 --> 01:13:18,050
Now this is level nine...

1021
01:13:18,092 --> 01:13:20,253
[shivering]

1022
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:22,263
the deepest level of hell,

1023
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:26,063
furthest removed
from all light and warmth.

1024
01:13:28,002 --> 01:13:29,936
This is six.

1025
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:32,599
It's goddamn five.

1026
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,801
I think I see
the pattern.

1027
01:13:34,842 --> 01:13:38,107
Yes, I can see
the pattern.

1028
01:13:38,146 --> 01:13:39,545
Lily:
Mike.

1029
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:42,743
Mike, can you hear me?

1030
01:13:42,784 --> 01:13:45,878
- Michael, where the hell are you?
- Lily.

1031
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,717
Michael?

1032
01:13:47,755 --> 01:13:49,780
- Mike.
- Lily.

1033
01:13:49,824 --> 01:13:52,588
[sighs]
Michael, can you hear me?

1034
01:13:52,627 --> 01:13:54,117
Lily.

1035
01:13:57,465 --> 01:14:00,298
Oh my God. Thank God.
Jesus, I've been trying to get through!

1036
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:02,496
- Did you call the cops?
- Yeah yeah, they're at the hotel.

1037
01:14:02,537 --> 01:14:04,562
- Didn't you say the Dolphin?
- Yes.

1038
01:14:04,605 --> 01:14:07,073
- You're sure?
- Yes yes, 1408.

1039
01:14:07,108 --> 01:14:10,134
Mike, they're in 1408.

1040
01:14:10,178 --> 01:14:12,009
The room's empty.

1041
01:14:12,046 --> 01:14:13,411
Mike?

1042
01:14:14,649 --> 01:14:17,140
Michael,
can you hear me?

1043
01:14:17,185 --> 01:14:18,709
- [grunts]
- Michael?

1044
01:14:18,753 --> 01:14:20,778
Michael,
where the hell are you?

1045
01:14:20,822 --> 01:14:23,518
I'm afraid I can't express
myself in this climate.

1046
01:14:23,558 --> 01:14:25,355
Calm down, okay?
We'll figure this out.

1047
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:27,452
- Don't panic.
- I'm supposed to die here.

1048
01:14:27,495 --> 01:14:29,929
Michael, stop it!
You're not gonna die, okay?

1049
01:14:29,964 --> 01:14:31,898
Don't move.
I can be there in 15 minutes.

1050
01:14:35,236 --> 01:14:37,534
Mike?
Michael?

1051
01:14:37,572 --> 01:14:40,700
15 minutes
isn't enough time.

1052
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:43,142
- It'll be too late.
- No, it won't be too late.

1053
01:14:43,177 --> 01:14:44,644
- Lily.
- Don't...

1054
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:47,079
Actually, 15 minutes
is perfect.

1055
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:49,242
It's perfect.
Just come up. Come now.

1056
01:14:49,283 --> 01:14:50,614
- Good, yes.
- I need you.

1057
01:14:50,651 --> 01:14:52,619
You've always been someone
I can count on.

1058
01:14:52,653 --> 01:14:55,679
I know we haven't talked a lot
since... since Katie died,

1059
01:14:55,723 --> 01:14:58,590
- but I need you, sweetie.
- Wait!

1060
01:14:58,626 --> 01:15:01,026
I can't explain it here. You just have
to come here and talk to me.

1061
01:15:01,062 --> 01:15:02,188
I miss you too, but...

1062
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,959
When you get here,
don't talk to anybody.

1063
01:15:03,998 --> 01:15:05,397
Just come straight up to the 14th floor.

1064
01:15:05,433 --> 01:15:07,594
- Walk through the door.
- Shut up! Shut up!

1065
01:15:07,635 --> 01:15:09,762
- It's life or death, sweetie.
- Do not come up to the room!

1066
01:15:09,804 --> 01:15:11,499
- Okay.
- Don't come up to the room!

1067
01:15:11,539 --> 01:15:13,234
- I need to talk to you about Katie.
- Don't! Shut up!

1068
01:15:13,274 --> 01:15:15,333
- Lily, don't listen to him!
- Yes, good.

1069
01:15:15,376 --> 01:15:17,173
- It's a trick! Don't come up here!
- I'll be right there.

1070
01:15:17,211 --> 01:15:19,008
[crackling]

1071
01:15:22,950 --> 01:15:25,282
Lily! Lily!

My baby! My baby!

Man:
She's heading for the rocks!

1078
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:07,389
I don't want to die!

1079

Oh God!

01:16:26,347 --> 01:16:28,440
Man overboard!

01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:31,577
[screaming continues]

1084
01:16:33,821 --> 01:16:35,482
Come on!

Are you okay, buddy?

01:17:59,874 --> 01:18:01,535
Hey, are you breathing?

1090
01:18:03,344 --> 01:18:05,312
Man:
Come on, talk to me.

1091
01:18:05,346 --> 01:18:07,746
You guys,
give me a hand here!

1092

[machine beeping]

1093

Dr. Edwards to Oncology, please.

1094
01:18:23,564 --> 01:18:26,055
Hey.

1095
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,193
How are you feeling?

1096
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:31,895
- Am I out?
- You're okay. You're okay.

1097
01:18:31,939 --> 01:18:33,236
Lie down,
lie down, lie down.

1098
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:35,401
Lie down, lie down, lie down.
You're okay.

1099
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:37,001
You're in the hospital.

1100
01:18:37,044 --> 01:18:39,205
Hospital where?
In New York?

1101
01:18:39,246 --> 01:18:40,679
New York?
No no, you're in LA.

1102
01:18:40,715 --> 01:18:43,684
You got hit on the head
with your board.

1103
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:45,379
I can't believe
you still surf.

1104
01:18:46,821 --> 01:18:48,618
You flew here
just for me?

1105
01:18:48,656 --> 01:18:51,648
Yeah. Yeah,
I was worried.

1106
01:18:51,692 --> 01:18:53,887
They called.

1107
01:18:53,928 --> 01:18:56,453
I think I'm still listed
as your next of kin.

1108
01:18:56,497 --> 01:18:58,931
Okay, I'm not in New York.

1109
01:18:58,966 --> 01:19:01,434
- I'm out.
- Why do you keep saying that?

1110
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:06,266
I was in New York.
I was trapped.

1111
01:19:06,307 --> 01:19:09,071
In New York,
I was dying

1112
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:11,442
in this Kafkaesque hotel,

1113
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:13,640
the Dolphin.

1114
01:19:13,681 --> 01:19:16,707
- What?
- The Dolphin Hotel on 45th and Lex.

1115
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:18,309
- I spoke with you there.
- 45th and Lex?

1116
01:19:18,352 --> 01:19:20,513
- I called you.
- I've never heard of it.

1117
01:19:23,157 --> 01:19:26,649
You're gonna be okay.
You just need to rest.

1118
01:19:44,111 --> 01:19:47,376
Oh, we have a winner.

1119
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:51,281
600 bucks.

1120
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:05,291
Unbelievable.

1121
01:20:05,332 --> 01:20:07,493
I can see why
you live here.

1122
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:16,441
Why did you leave?

1123
01:20:22,983 --> 01:20:25,474
Because every time
I looked at you,

1124
01:20:25,519 --> 01:20:27,487
I saw her face.

1125
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:40,390
Lily:
I think it's pretty clear.

1126
01:20:40,434 --> 01:20:42,299
I think in the dream
the room's your subconscious

1127
01:20:42,336 --> 01:20:44,167
and it brought up
a lot of stuff.

1128
01:20:44,205 --> 01:20:46,002
That's a good thing
for you.

1129
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,065
But this was... I mean, I was down
the rabbit hole.

1130
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:50,509
I was rattled.
I was shook up.

1131
01:20:50,544 --> 01:20:52,409
And I can't shake it.
I think after dinner

1132
01:20:52,446 --> 01:20:53,913
you should drive me
back to the hospital,

1133
01:20:53,948 --> 01:20:56,849
- check me into the psych unit.
- [chuckles]

1134
01:20:58,552 --> 01:21:00,645
You look really great.

1135
01:21:00,688 --> 01:21:03,213
I can't believe
I'm sitting here with you.

1136
01:21:04,725 --> 01:21:06,249
Tell me about it.

1137
01:21:06,293 --> 01:21:08,488
Is everything all right?
Can I get you anything else?

1138
01:21:08,529 --> 01:21:11,828
I'll have another
glass of wine, please.

1139
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:14,426
The same.

1140
01:21:16,704 --> 01:21:18,194
Mike?

1141
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,866
Yeah, I'll have
another tequila...

1142
01:21:19,907 --> 01:21:21,397
Patron, chilled,
double.

1143
01:21:21,442 --> 01:21:23,000
Be right back.

1144
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:31,576
Katie was there.

1145
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:34,587
Mmm-hm.

1146
01:21:36,924 --> 01:21:38,482
Can you imagine

1147
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:40,892
what it feels like
to have the sensation?

1148
01:21:40,928 --> 01:21:42,953
I mean, the very
real sensation

1149
01:21:42,997 --> 01:21:44,988
that I talked to her,
like, two days ago?

1150
01:21:45,032 --> 01:21:47,796
I talked to her,
saw her, touched her.

1151
01:21:47,835 --> 01:21:50,201
Yeah.

1152
01:21:50,237 --> 01:21:52,933
I see her every night
when I shut my eyes.

1153
01:21:54,742 --> 01:21:56,369
Yeah, but it was so vivid.

1154
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:59,504
It was so real.

1155
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:01,447
Maybe you should
write about it.

1156
01:22:01,482 --> 01:22:04,076
About Katie?
Shit.

1157
01:22:04,118 --> 01:22:06,951
- You always were tougher than me.
- Why not?

1158
01:22:06,987 --> 01:22:09,979
Seriously, it sounds like
you're ready to deal with this stuff.

1159
01:22:14,261 --> 01:22:16,695
Can you stay?

1160
01:22:26,106 --> 01:22:28,472
I'm sorry.

1161
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:35,740
Okay, we have got 148.

1162
01:22:35,783 --> 01:22:38,274
148 is gonna be
right about...

1163
01:22:38,319 --> 01:22:41,083
Uh-huh.

1164
01:22:41,121 --> 01:22:44,181
So if you'd like
to sign on the line.

1165
01:22:46,193 --> 01:22:48,127
Hey!
Hey, man!

1166
01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:50,392
You've been
gone a while.

1167
01:22:50,431 --> 01:22:53,366
Oh, by the way,
dude, I read your book.

1168
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:57,302
What is it?
"10 Most Haunted Motels," right?

1169
01:22:57,338 --> 01:22:59,238
That's some scary shit.

1170
01:23:02,843 --> 01:23:05,539
See you around.

1171
01:23:43,317 --> 01:23:45,080
Did I drop a postcard?

1172
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:46,609
- What?
- Did I?

1173
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,178
- Huh?
- A postcard.

1174
01:23:48,222 --> 01:23:50,816
No, I think I would
have seen it.

1175
01:23:53,427 --> 01:23:55,088
But if I find it,
I'll put it in your mailbox.

1176
01:23:55,129 --> 01:23:56,790
Okay?

1177
01:24:27,227 --> 01:24:30,355
Mike: My experience in the room
was terrifying,

1178
01:24:30,397 --> 01:24:33,889
a fragmented loop
of unease and despair.

1179
01:24:33,934 --> 01:24:36,027
1408 was a horrible dream,

1180
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:40,666
yet somehow
I awoke from it renewed.

1181
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:43,108
Sam:
Mikey! You sound happy.

1182
01:24:43,143 --> 01:24:44,906
- You're scaring me.
- I wouldn't go that far,

1183
01:24:44,945 --> 01:24:47,436
but I must say that the work
is just pouring out of me.

1184
01:24:47,481 --> 01:24:49,847
I think I've actually
reinvented myself

1185
01:24:49,883 --> 01:24:52,750
in the form of a kind
of a fictional memoir...

1186
01:24:52,786 --> 01:24:54,515
"Autobiography
of a Nightmare:

1187
01:24:54,555 --> 01:24:57,023
Truman Capote meets H.R. Giger."
What do you think?

1188
01:24:57,057 --> 01:24:59,855
I love it!
"'ln Cold Blood' with 'Aliens!"'

1189
01:24:59,893 --> 01:25:02,225
That's sexy.
I wanna put it out to auction,

1190
01:25:02,262 --> 01:25:04,753
start a bidding war.
When can I read it?

1191
01:25:04,798 --> 01:25:07,631
Easy, tiger. Any day now.
You're gonna get it as soon as I finish.

1192
01:25:07,668 --> 01:25:09,863
Okay, Mike.
Less talking, more writing.

1193
01:25:09,903 --> 01:25:12,394
Hey, where's that decaf?
I'm dying here.

1194
01:25:38,999 --> 01:25:40,796
Thank you.

1195
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:55,939
Hey, Pop.

1196
01:26:03,857 --> 01:26:06,690
How are you doing,
old boy?

1197
01:26:06,727 --> 01:26:10,163
Can you hear me?

1198
01:26:10,197 --> 01:26:12,392
I don't think so.

1199
01:26:21,942 --> 01:26:23,603
I know I haven't been
here in a few months,

1200
01:26:23,644 --> 01:26:26,408
but I just wanted to...

1201
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:29,177
come by and see
how you're doing and...

1202
01:26:31,151 --> 01:26:34,780
tell you I was doing okay.

1203
01:26:34,822 --> 01:26:38,417
Doing pretty good, actually.

1204
01:26:39,893 --> 01:26:43,351
I started talking
to Lily again.

1205
01:26:43,397 --> 01:26:47,094
And I wrote a new book,

1206
01:26:47,134 --> 01:26:49,967
which I actually think
you would like...

1207
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:54,733
believe it or not.

1208
01:26:54,775 --> 01:26:58,142
[sighs]

1209
01:27:02,049 --> 01:27:03,778
Michael.

1210
01:27:03,817 --> 01:27:06,980
Dad.

1211
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:10,421
Michael.

1212
01:27:10,457 --> 01:27:13,824
Yeah.

1213
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:17,058
Yeah.

1214
01:27:24,204 --> 01:27:26,638
So...

1215
01:27:29,843 --> 01:27:31,504
[horn blowing]

1216
01:27:31,545 --> 01:27:34,844
Man: Hey, you can't park there!
Move it down, will you?

1217
01:27:34,882 --> 01:27:38,283
Hey, I got a package
I need to overnight.

1218
01:27:38,318 --> 01:27:41,481
Is this the right form? I got to get
this to New York by tomorrow morning.

1219
01:27:41,522 --> 01:27:43,149
Man:
I'm sorry, sir, but we're closed.

1220
01:27:48,228 --> 01:27:49,559
Very well.

1221
01:28:56,863 --> 01:28:58,694
[mumbling]

01:29:29,396 --> 01:29:31,227
[squeaking]

1223
01:30:03,363 --> 01:30:05,797
I was out.

1224
01:30:07,801 --> 01:30:09,632
Is that Katie?

1225
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:12,332
[sobbing]
Is that Katie?

1226
01:30:12,372 --> 01:30:14,704
I was out.

1227
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,413
I was out!

1228
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:27,412
I was out.
Please, God.

1229
01:30:27,454 --> 01:30:30,150
I know I was out.

1230

[knocking]

1232
01:31:18,438 --> 01:31:20,633
Yeah.

1233
01:31:25,712 --> 01:31:27,577
Open it.

1234
01:31:27,614 --> 01:31:29,548

[girl giggling]

1240
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:55,765
Katie: Daddy.

1241
01:31:59,479 --> 01:32:03,176
- Daddy?
- No.

1242
01:32:03,216 --> 01:32:05,912
- You're not Katie.
- I need help.

1243
01:32:05,952 --> 01:32:08,682
- [panting]
- Please.

1244
01:32:08,722 --> 01:32:10,053
You're not real.

1245
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:11,523
I'm cold.

I love you, Daddy.

Don't you love me anymore?

1250

Of course I do,
sweetheart.

1251
01:32:43,089 --> 01:32:45,683
There we go.
I got you.

1252
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,321
I got you now, Katie.

1253

- Oh my God.
- They won't let me stay.

1254

- Yes, they will.
- They won't let me stay.

- What?
- They won't let me stay.

1256
01:32:56,970 --> 01:33:00,303
No no no no no. Nobody's ever going
to take you away again.

1257
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:04,174
I got you now, Katie.
Oh my God.

1258
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:05,974
- I'm not gonna let you go.
- Do you love me, Daddy?

1259
01:33:06,012 --> 01:33:08,446
Of course I do. I love you more than
anything in the world.

you, me, and Mommy.

You can't take her twice.

You can't.

Not again.

No.

No.

By the way, Mr. Enslin,
your wife just called.

1306
01:38:10,016 --> 01:38:12,644
She'll be here in five minutes
and we'll send her straight up.

1307
01:38:12,685 --> 01:38:15,017
She's not involved.

1308
01:38:15,054 --> 01:38:17,887
You can't have her.

1309
01:38:17,924 --> 01:38:20,722
I'm done arguing with you.

1310
01:38:23,530 --> 01:38:25,293
I'm gonna end this.

1311
01:38:25,331 --> 01:38:27,356
Five.
This is five.

1312

[voice distorts] Ignore the siren.
Even if you leave this room,

1313

you can never
leave this room.

1314
01:38:32,906 --> 01:38:36,774
Eight.
This is eight.

1315
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:40,075
We have killed
your friends.

1316
01:38:40,113 --> 01:38:42,638
Every friend

1317

is now dead.

I lived the life of a selfish man.

But I don't have
to die that way.

1320
01:39:04,037 --> 01:39:05,436
If I'm going down,

1321
01:39:05,471 --> 01:39:08,634
I'm taking you with me.

1322
01:39:11,811 --> 01:39:13,779
This may not all be real,

1323
01:39:13,813 --> 01:39:16,475
and I may not even be real,

1324
01:39:16,516 --> 01:39:18,814
but this fire...

1325
01:39:21,721 --> 01:39:24,053
that's got to be real.

1326
01:39:34,234 --> 01:39:35,997
Go to hell!

Get out onto the street!

1330
01:39:59,859 --> 01:40:01,884
Out the doors
and onto the street, please.

1331
01:40:01,928 --> 01:40:04,328
Everyone stay calm.

1332

- [honking]
- [sirens wailing]

1333
01:40:07,567 --> 01:40:10,661
- What's going on?
- Driver: I don't know, lady.

1334
01:40:10,703 --> 01:40:13,934
This might take a while.
Something must have happened.

1335
01:40:13,973 --> 01:40:16,339
Thanks.

Keep quiet,
you bastard.

1339
01:40:29,222 --> 01:40:31,053
Please, you've gotta help me.
No, help me.

1340
01:40:31,090 --> 01:40:32,455
- Calm down.
- My husband's inside.

1341
01:40:32,492 --> 01:40:34,551
My husband's inside.
You've gotta help him.

1342
01:40:34,594 --> 01:40:36,357
You've gotta help him,
please!

1343
01:40:36,396 --> 01:40:37,795
What floor?
What floor?

1344
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:39,957
14th floor, 1408.
Mike Enslin.

1345
01:40:39,999 --> 01:40:42,433
Please come here.

1346
01:40:42,468 --> 01:40:46,268
- [moaning]
- You're wasting your time.

1347
01:40:51,778 --> 01:40:54,372
We're here
to do the job,

1348
01:40:54,414 --> 01:40:56,541
and we don't rattle.

The decor is in tatters

1350

and the staff surly.

1351
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:07,626
But on the Shiver Scale...

1352
01:41:09,028 --> 01:41:12,293
I award the Dolphin
10 skulls!

1353

Never kill

Daddy, everyone dies.

[laughing]

1359
01:42:21,734 --> 01:42:24,965
We commend to Almighty God
our brother,

1360
01:42:25,004 --> 01:42:28,064
and we commit his body
to the ground,

1361
01:42:28,107 --> 01:42:31,668
earth to earth,
ashes to ashes,

1362

dust to dust.

1363
01:42:35,314 --> 01:42:36,975
May you rest in peace.

1364
01:42:37,016 --> 01:42:38,813
Amen.

1365
01:42:38,851 --> 01:42:40,580
All: Amen.

1366
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:43,088
Well, they're together now.

1367
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:49,524
Let's go.

1368
01:42:56,969 --> 01:42:59,164
Olin:
Mrs. Enslin?

1369
01:43:03,509 --> 01:43:06,000
I...

1370
01:43:06,045 --> 01:43:08,411
I am sorry to intrude at such
a delicate time,

1371
01:43:08,448 --> 01:43:11,246
but I knew your husband.
I worked at the Dolphin.

1372
01:43:11,284 --> 01:43:13,252
Oh.

1373
01:43:13,286 --> 01:43:16,153
While we were cleaning up,
we came across some of his belongings.

1374
01:43:16,189 --> 01:43:18,555
No, thank you.

1375
01:43:18,591 --> 01:43:20,582
They are of such
a personal nature, ma'am.

1376
01:43:20,626 --> 01:43:22,753
- I figured maybe you would want to...
- No, please.

1377
01:43:22,795 --> 01:43:24,990
It's not how
I want to remember him.

1378
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:27,431
I'm sure you understand.

1379
01:43:27,467 --> 01:43:29,128
Oh yes, yes.
Of course I understand.

1380
01:43:29,168 --> 01:43:31,830
But it's important that you know
that he did a great thing.

1381
01:43:31,871 --> 01:43:34,066
He did not die
in vain.

1382
01:43:34,107 --> 01:43:36,405
What are you talking about?

1383
01:43:36,442 --> 01:43:38,603
Because of him,
the room won't reopen. It's been...

1384
01:43:38,644 --> 01:43:40,737
All right, okay, stop.

1385
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:43,613
Just give
the lady some air.

1386
01:43:43,649 --> 01:43:45,879
She's been through enough,
don't you think?

Mike:
Round one goes to the hideous Mr. Olin

1389
01:44:32,698 --> 01:44:33,995
for effective
aggressiveness.

1390
01:44:34,033 --> 01:44:36,467
I have to admit,
he had me going.

1391
01:44:36,502 --> 01:44:37,935
Get ahold of yourself.

1392
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:40,632
You're running to places
that aren't real.

Katie:
Daddy,

1394
01:44:42,241 --> 01:44:44,232
don't you
love me anymore?

1395
01:44:44,277 --> 01:44:46,404
Mike:
Of course I do, sweetheart.

1396
01:44:46,445 --> 01:44:49,005
- Don't you love me, Daddy?
- Of course I do, honey,

1397
01:44:49,048 --> 01:44:51,243
more than anything.
I got you now.

1398
01:44:51,284 --> 01:44:53,912
I got you right here, sweetie.
Everything's fine.

1399
01:44:53,953 --> 01:44:57,320
I got you, Katie.
Nobody's ever gonna take you away again.
