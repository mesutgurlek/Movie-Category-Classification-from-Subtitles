That's what my parents
used to say about my eyes.

They weren't my real parents.

BRIAN: So, how did you get into this?

202
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,564
Initially my field was abnormal psychology,

203
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,442
which, despite the frightening title,

204
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,863
merely indicates the study of behavior
outside the norm.

You run into a lot of charlatans,
con artists, and mental deficients, Brian,

COUPLAND: I think David used
the character of Mr. Gregor

his mind was wreaking.

Jane is mentally sculpting Evey?

doing these things, David?

215

Mr. Gregor was a character
from a bedtime story

Whatever it was, it scared
the hell out of me.

525

You're scared because you can't
explain what you've seen.

526

So your mind falls back
on the stories that scared you as a child.

I'd call it "teleplasm."

- That was teleplasm? Bloody hell.

which one of you was it?

822
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,562
What if it didn't come from any of us?

823
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:29,192
What if she's just a vessel or a conduit?

824
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,361
She needs to go to the hospital.

825
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:34,572
Try to control your hysteria, Kristina,
it's beneath you.

826
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,242
- She's just expressing what she thinks...
- No one's asking you, Harry!

827
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:40,245
Don't talk to us like we're children.
We are colleagues.

828
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,163
Then think before you speak, colleague.

829
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:45,416
With each paranormal event,
we learn more about how to eradicate it!

830
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:50,547
To probe like scientists,
not school girls.

831
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:52,882
That is so incredibly sexist.

832
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:55,176
Perhaps it doesn't fit
our hypothesis exactly.

833
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:57,262
Well, not if she's possessed, it doesn't!

834
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:58,596
JANE: I can't be.

835
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:03,226
We made her, didn't we, Joseph?

836
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,107
And we can purge her.

837
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,778
You believe that
with all your heart, don't you?

838
01:07:15,739 --> 01:07:18,616
We can stop this experiment
right now if you wish to.

839
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:19,784
No.

840
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,287
I don't want to hear another word

841
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:25,623
of this superstitious nonsense
uttered in this house again.

842
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,962
If any of you are too frightened,

843
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,131
well, you can leave.

844
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,384
I am too frightened.

845
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,804
We should go back to Oxford.

846
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,098
Salvage what's left of the term.

847
01:07:42,474 --> 01:07:43,474
What about Jane?

848
01:07:44,768 --> 01:07:45,935
I'm sorry.

849
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,897
We gave her a break,
now we need one.

850
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,618
Have you seen this sigil before?

851
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:05,997
Does it mean anything to you?

852
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,790
I can't remember.

853
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:10,835
Try, Jane, it's important.

854
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,425
Before I came here,

855
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,803
I was never comfortable with who I was.

856
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:24,515
Have you ever felt like that?

857
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:27,364
You ever heard someone call out your name,

858
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,270
but you couldn't recognize it as your own?

859
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,231
Or looked at old photographs of yourself,

860
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,192
but you couldn't recognize your face?

861
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:39,030
I felt like that for as
long as I can remember.

862
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:47,956
Don't lose faith in Joseph,

863
01:08:49,249 --> 01:08:50,458
or in Evey.

864
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:53,962
Or in me.

865
01:08:56,548 --> 01:08:57,966
We need you.

866
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:07,809
For the first time in my life,

867
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:10,228
I think there's finally
a way for me to be happy.

868
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,565
Evey's making that happen.

869
01:09:17,569 --> 01:09:19,487
- We can't.
- Why not?

870
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:21,906
Not yet.

871
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:23,199

I'll be back as soon as I can. Alright?

884

- Do you understand?
- Does she understand what?

885
01:12:38,478 --> 01:12:40,771
I have to go to the film lab,
get more stock.

What took you so long?

912
01:16:35,882 --> 01:16:38,467
They called themselves "Lilitu."

913
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:43,180
A cult, devoted to an ancient demon
worshipped by the Sumerians

914
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:45,558
5,000 years before Christianity.

915

It's not a joke, it's Evey!

918
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,360
Evey?

919
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:58,821
Evey Dwyer.

920
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,700
As a child
she exhibited a gift for clairvoyance.

921
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:06,537
Their leader Dr. Heinrich Dwyer
became convinced

922
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:09,206
that Evey could reincarnate their idol.

923
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:12,209
On June 6th, 1954,

924
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:15,504
Dr. Dwyer claimed that Evey
had received a message that

925
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:18,549
the Lilitu should lock themselves
inside this building.

926
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:23,762
A massive fire destroyed the building
that night, killing everyone inside.

01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:29,059
Sir.

who was born with a birthmark, a sigil.

930
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:41,906
Evey Dwyer for some reason is

931
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:44,241
a force that possesses Jane Harper.

932
01:17:44,367 --> 01:17:45,409
Oh, my God.

933
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:49,580
Evey's gonna do to us
what she did to the Lilitu.

- (CRYING) She's a...

Or...

941
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:11,185
Or what?

942
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:13,270
The rational explanation.

943
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:16,065
That Jane somehow found
out about this cult.

944
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,274
When she was four?

945
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:18,882
She heard it at the breakfast table,

946
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:20,302
her parents read it in a newspaper.

947
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,112
You make anything fit into your hypothesis.

948
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,865
This only strengthens
my hypothesis actually, Harry.

949
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:28,202
When we ask Jane to go deep
she plucked the name

950
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:30,788
Evey Dwyer out of
the deepest recesses of her mind.

951
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:32,873
That is what she is manifesting,

952
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:34,625
that is what you call her "possession!"

You know about her, don't you?

01:18:49,557 --> 01:18:52,810
You found out about her
or somebody told you about her.

But you knew about her before I found you.
