I'm not a scientist!

I knew I am a very good liar
and I wanted to survive.

You know what's happening in here
and you let it happen.

You shouldn't see this as a sentence.

A lot?

00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:26,644

it was good
you weren't here for it.

He wants to go to Atlanta,

Then you stay.
I'll go.

23
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:52,874
I owe it to Carol.

24
00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:55,377
We all owe Carol.

25

I owe her more.

26
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,487
All right.

27

No.

Should we get him to the church?

61

Well, what's next on the agenda?

At sundown we fire
a shot into the air.

76
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:43,971
Get two of them out on patrol.

77
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:48,276
Then once it's dark enough that the
rooftop spotter won't see us, we go.

78
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,281
<i>We cut the locks on one of the

He slits his throat.

82
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:02,491
This is all about us doing this
quiet, keeping the upper hand.

83

<i>They're not expecting us.</i>

Daryl, you take care
of whoever is in the kitchen.

88
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:19,999

89

<i>If they're smart, the rest
of them will give up.</i>

91

Six on three once we get
a weapon to Beth.

92
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,775
12 on three.
The wards will help.

That's best case.
What's worst case?

94

going down the hall
at the wrong time.

96

Then it's not quiet.
All hands on deck.

97

We're talking about a lot

- If that's what it takes.
- It's not.

99
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:53,130
If we get a couple of her cops

100
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:56,734
alive out here,
we do an even trade.

You say this Dawn, she's just
trying to keep it together, right?

107
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:20,862
Trying and doing
are two different things.

108
00:10:20,864 --> 00:10:23,928
You take two of her cops away,

109
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,731
what choices does she have?

110
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,932
Everybody goes home.

Pick one.

113
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,878
You need to learn
how to defend yourself.

114

We can teach you.

115

<i>Good choice.</i>

127

But you're not holding it right.

128
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:53,576

Yes, actually, there was.

142

The patient in exam room two,

she was half dead

Are we really gonna keep wasting
valuable resources on this lady?

147
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:57,481
How much electricity
does your DVD take?

- Excuse me?
- We have very limited resources here.

Turn off the machines.

154
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:18,037
Tell Edwards to take the
patient off of his rounds.

155

If she pulls through
on her own, then fine.

She's not worth the effort.

There's nothing I can do.

164
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:53,786
So you'll just have to do it.

165
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:57,689
You're gonna save
that woman's life.

166
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:03,259
This is to the drug locker.

167
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:05,128
I don't even trust
Edwards with this.

168
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,896
So take it.

169
00:14:06,898 --> 00:14:08,863
Shepherd on radio: <i>It's Shepherd.
I'm on roof detail.</i>

170
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:12,231
<i>Just heard a gunshot</i>
<i>maybe a mile north-northeast.</i>

171
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:15,502
Grab Lamson, take a car
and track it down.

172
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:17,104
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

173
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,909
Why are you doing this?

174
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:23,277
I thought you were weak.

175
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:27,313
You've proved me wrong.

176
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:32,217
Glenn:
<i>We need more water.</i>

177
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:33,883
There's a creek up the road

178
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:35,784
a few miles southwest of here.

179
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:40,325
Y'all go.
I'll stay here.

180
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:42,824
- You sure?
- I am.

181
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:49,431
Okay.

182
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,308
(walkers snarling)

183
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:19,195
Just stay here, guys.
Don't get up.

184
00:15:19,197 --> 00:15:22,431
There is nothing
for you in Washington.

185
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:24,668
That's not funny.

186
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,337
It's not not not not funny.

187
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:29,874
Hey, I get that we're all dealing
with things in different ways--

188
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:33,944
Listen, I don't know what
to do without DC anymore,

189
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,180
but I'm not dealing with it.
I'm over it.

190
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:38,215
I just want him to be okay.

191
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:41,887
Eugene wasn't strong.
He isn't fast.

192
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:43,689
He doesn't know
how to use a weapon.

193
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:46,057
The truth hurts,
but he's useless.

194
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:48,360
He had one skill
that kept him living.

195
00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:50,430
Are we supposed to be mad
at him 'cause he used it?

196
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,167
Damn right.

197
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:22,033
Get over yourself.

198
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:26,241
You're not the only one
who lost something today.

199
00:17:28,977 --> 00:17:31,380
It's never gonna get
any better than this.

200
00:17:48,136 --> 00:17:50,300
Beth.

201
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,233
Can I?

202
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:55,534
Yeah, sure.

203
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:05,376
The woman in exam room two,

204
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:07,614
what medicine
would you give her?

205
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:09,149
Dawn called it.

206
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:12,182
I know, but if you could,
what would you give her?

207
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:15,751
She was in a car accident.
She suffered internal injuries.

208
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:18,623
- It's just a guessing game.
- So guess.

209
00:18:20,092 --> 00:18:22,995
You have the key.

210
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:26,230
Did you take it
or did she give it to you?

211
00:18:26,232 --> 00:18:28,267
Because if she gave it to
you, she did not do it

212
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:29,569
out of the kindness
of her heart.

213
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:32,536
Don't. Just tell
me what medicine.

214
00:18:32,538 --> 00:18:35,138
I was trying to save my life.

215
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:39,111
I'm still wondering if I did.

216
00:18:42,884 --> 00:18:44,987
Epinephrine drip,
five milligrams.

217
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,092
She won't wake up right away,

218
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,793
but it'll ease her blood
pressure so she'll have a shot.

219
00:18:56,868 --> 00:18:58,601
Hey.

220
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:02,105
Good luck.

221
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:13,378
(sighs)

222
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,914
Perfect.

223
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:19,018
You think it's any
clearer upstream?

224
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,953
<i>(fabric ripping)</i>

225
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:25,125
Probably not.

226
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:27,559
Doesn't matter.

227
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:29,228
Let me see.

228
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:36,871
Tara:<i> So, you just built a water
filter in about two minutes, huh?</i>

229
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:39,110
Eugene taught me.

230
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:42,413
Takes a while, but it'll be clear.
Then we can boil it.

231
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,985
Were you with Abraham
before it all happened?

232
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:48,985
No.

233
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,555
No, I was with other people
just trying to make it.

234
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,295
How'd you wind up together?

235
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:02,498
We crossed paths in Dallas.

236
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,333
Me and my group, we were
fighting off some dead ones

237
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:07,200
and he jumped in
from out of nowhere

238
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:09,333
with that big truck.

239
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:11,403
Rest in peace.

240
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:13,304
He had Eugene in the cab.

241
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:16,242
And afterwards, he told me that
he was trying to save the world.

242
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:20,676
And that he saw what I could do.

243
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,812
And he wanted my help.

244
00:20:25,914 --> 00:20:28,017
He was the first person
to ask me for that

245
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,019
since this all started.

246
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:37,130
Maybe he was lying, too.

247
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:47,347
(splashes)

248
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:49,450
You see that?

249
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:53,385
Those ripples.

250
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:55,221
Those are fish.

251
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:58,692
Okay, how?

252
00:20:58,694 --> 00:21:00,560
Come on.

253
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,061
Lamson:
<i>Shots were from over there.</i>

254
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,762
<i>I swear to God I heard it.</i>

255
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:10,399
-<i> (gunshots)</i>
-<i> There. There!</i>

256
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,805
- Put it down, Noah.
- Put the gun down.

<i>(car door closes)</i>

258

Hands up.
Turn around.

00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:35,885
<i>(zip tie zings)</i>

260
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,787
You let me know
if it's too tight, okay?

261
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:40,758
I thought you were smart, Noah.
You think we wouldn't hear you?

262
00:21:44,828 --> 00:21:46,597
Where are those rotters
you were shooting at?

263
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:49,234
(whistles)
Hands.

264
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:50,670
What do you want?

265
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:54,345
Whatever this is, we can help.

266
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:58,249
You do what we say,
we don't hurt you.

267
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:03,690
Okay.

268
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:09,062
Good.
Now turn around.

269
00:22:09,064 --> 00:22:11,666
Put your guns on
the floor and kneel.

270
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:25,850
We need to talk.

271
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:30,053
There's water if you
need some and food.

272
00:22:33,624 --> 00:22:35,992
Mind if I ask you something?

273
00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:42,497
The way you talk...

274
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:46,332
the way you carry yourself...

275
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,701
were you a cop?

276
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,542
Believe it or not, I was, too.

277
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:58,679
That's Lamson.

278
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,546
He'll be down for this.

279
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:02,516
He's one of the good ones.

280
00:23:02,518 --> 00:23:04,220

Rick. Rick!

293

Rick, three is better than two.

294
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:29,147
Your friend, what's his name?

295
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:32,282
I need to talk to him. Your plan is
going to get me and my friends killed.

296
00:26:32,284 --> 00:26:33,952
We're gonna make it work.

297
00:26:33,954 --> 00:26:36,386
It would work if you had
different cops to trade.

298

<i>Dawn's running Grady</i>
<i>into the ground.</i>

A bunch of us want her out
and she knows it.

300
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,697
Pretty sure she knows we want
Lamson to replace her, too.

301
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:46,431
Dawn doesn't know that.

302
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:48,098
She might.

303
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,298
And she's smart.

304
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,103
So there's a good chance
you can't make this deal work

305
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:54,569
and that'll leave us all dead.
