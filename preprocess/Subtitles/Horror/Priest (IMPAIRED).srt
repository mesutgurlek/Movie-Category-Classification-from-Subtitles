This is what is known,

there has always been man

00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:58,564

always been vampires.

Since the beginning, the two
have been locked in conflict.

15
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,814
The vampires were quicker,
stronger,

16
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:21,551
but man had the sun.

17
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,896
It was not enough.

18
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:52,415
And so it went
like this over many years.

19
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:56,249
The two races destroying
not only each other,

20

but the world itself.

Facing extinction,

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,561
mankind withdrew behind walled Cities
under the protection of the Church.

23
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:13,672
And then the ultimate
weapon was found,

24
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:15,305
the Priests.

25
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:25,451
Warriors with
extraordinary powers,

26
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:29,316
trained by the Church
in the art of vampire combat.

27
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,118
They alone turned
the tide for man.

28
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:38,764
The remaining vampires
were placed on reservations.

29
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:42,328
And, fearing the power
of the weapon they created,

30
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:46,302
the ruling Clergy
ordered the Priests disbanded.

31
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:50,943
The former warriors to be
integrated back into a society,

32
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,104
that no longer needed them.

33
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:57,680
And as the years passed,

34
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:02,316
the few surviving Priests
faded into obscurity

35
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,182
like the vampire menace
before them.

a life outside this outpost.

Monsignor Chamberlain.

168
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:23,742
Thank you. You may sit.

169
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:27,612
I am begging you.

170
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:30,619
Allow me to find her.

171
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:33,885
You must understand
something, Priest.

172
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,291
The sanctity of these
walls is absolute.

173
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:41,460
And the citizens from the
Cities have complete faith

174
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:44,069
in the Church's ability
to keep them safe.

175
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:46,430
You will not shake that faith.

176
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:49,339
What good is that faith
when it's a lie?

177
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:53,776
Questioning the authority of the
Clergy is absolutely forbidden.

178
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,107
If you take any action
to leave the Cities,

179
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,742
it will be seen as an act of
aggression against the Church.

180
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:02,185
You will be stripped from the Order
and excommunicated immediately.

181
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:03,346
Do I make myself clear?

182
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:09,422
I said do I make
myself clear, Father?

183
00:14:11,097 --> 00:14:12,689
Yes, Monsignor.

184
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,761
Try to remember your vow,

185
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:22,497
to go against the Church
is to go against God.

186
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:37,845
(SCREAMING)

187
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,815
Come on, now.

188
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:42,954
Don't be shy.

189
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:45,728
Give us a kiss.

190
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:53,133
BLACK HAT: That's no way
to treat a friend.

191
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:55,905
Please. Let me go.

192
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:58,406
You're in there
for your own protection.

193
00:14:58,744 --> 00:15:01,076
If I let you out,
you'll be torn apart.

194
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:02,909
Piece by piece.

195
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:07,216
My uncle's a Priest.
He'll come after me.

196
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:09,484
Really?

197
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:11,713
What makes you so sure?

198
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:13,855
He'll come after me.

199
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:16,321
He'll come after you!

200
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:20,187
Now that's something
I'm absolutely

201
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,867
counting on.

202
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:30,273
CHAMBERLAIN:
Judgment is final.

203
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:31,938
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:39,015
I sacrificed everything
to serve them.

205
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:42,548
Now they won't listen to me.

206
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:44,246
The war is long over.

207
00:15:44,423 --> 00:15:46,755
You and the other Priests
did your jobs.

208
00:15:46,826 --> 00:15:49,727
It's not over.
Not for me.

209
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:53,995
You can't break your covenant to hunt
down a small group of scavengers.

210
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,260
It would be sacrilege.

211
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:57,068
I have to.

212
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:01,838
That's what I was afraid of.

213
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:02,930
(DOOR BANGING OPEN)

214
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:05,937
GUARD 1: Move.
GUARD 2: Get out of the way.

215
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:07,070
Stand back.

216
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:15,020
If you go out there right now, you
risk stirring things up again.

217
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:20,047
You have to look at the bigger picture.
It's for the greater good.

218
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:22,625
Is this the world I fought for?

219
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:24,320
No,

220
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:27,922
but it's the only world
we have left.

221
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:33,334
I'm begging you,
don't do anything foolish.

222
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,274
Remember your vow,

223
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:39,675
to go against the Church
is to go against God.

224
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:42,978
Then I go against God.

225
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:56,050
(GRUNTING)

226
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:12,709
God help us.

227
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:18,540
PRIEST: Dear Father,
forgive me.

228
00:17:20,186 --> 00:17:22,552
It was never my intention
to offend you.

229
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:27,983
I would like to firmly resolve
with the help of your grace

230
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:34,030
to sin no more, and to avoid
the near occasions of sin,

231
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:36,527
but I can't.

232
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:46,667
(BEEPING)

233
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:36,984
(ALARM SOUNDING)

234
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,524
(GUN COCKING)

235
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:51,035
HICKS: Lootin's not such
a good idea, mister.

236
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:54,496
Well, I'll be damned.

237
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:03,641
Vampires are a vicious lot.

238
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:06,483
I have seen a vampire

239
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:09,855
bite a man clean in half.

240
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:14,288
Salvation is right here
in my very hands.

241
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:17,556
Authenticated by
the Clergy themselves.

242
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:19,858
SALESMAN: Purchase this holy water...
Excuse me a minute.

243
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:22,900
...and keep your loved
ones safe tonight.

244
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:23,957
(GUNSHOT)
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

245
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:30,006
I am tired of you comin'
around here scarin' people

246
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:32,234
selling your superstition.

247
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:33,469
Show's over.

248
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:35,473
And it's time for you to go.

249
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:37,880
Give me one good reason
why I should.

250
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,385
That's one.

251
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:43,579
Two.

252
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:46,089
All right, all right!
All right!

253
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:48,883
Goddamn son of a bitch!

254
00:20:51,497 --> 00:20:52,930
Now, y'all listen up.

255
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:56,862
This stuff is good for nothin'

256
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:59,530
but linin' that man's pockets
with your hard-earned cash.

257
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:01,937
VILLAGER: You don't know that.
You're just a kid.

258
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:03,941
We gotta do somethin'
to keep us safe.

259
00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:05,542
Move out of the way!

260
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,275
I don't blame any
of you for bein' scared,

261
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,249
but the vampires are gone
and they're not comin' back.

262
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:26,929
You'll have to excuse the attention.
Strangers aren't too common out here.

263
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:31,969
Is it true what they say
about Priests?

264
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:34,462
You wield the hand of God?

265
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:41,074
How is he?

266
00:21:42,815 --> 00:21:43,907
He's awake.

267
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,753
The Clergy took away a boy

268
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,762
and returned an old man.

269
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:09,639
After the war was over, Shannon
figured you'd come back.

270
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:12,342
I wanted to.

271
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:18,610
Didn't seem right anymore.

272
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:20,976
I couldn't save her.

273
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:26,785
I tried, but I never
had your gift.

274
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,854
You gave her a life
I no longer could.

275
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,860
I will always be
grateful to you for that.

276
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:39,537
Never a day went by when I didn't
wish she'd forget about you.

277
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:52,283
You find Lucy.

278
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:55,112
You bring her home safe.

279
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,817
And you promise me
somethin', brother,

280
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:02,059
kill 'em all.

281
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:11,533
Most people out here know the Clergy think
of us as a bunch of godless heathens.

282
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:13,366
And that's how we like it.

283
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:16,168
It means they tend to keep their
noses out of our business.

284
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:18,875
So you can imagine
how surprised I was

285
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:21,912
when they contacted me
askin' if I'd seen you.

286
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:26,147
Sayin' that anyone goin' after Lucy
is to be arrested immediately.

287
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:29,919
Said she's in God's hands now.

288
00:23:30,589 --> 00:23:35,492
Problem is, we both know outside
of a week, Lucy will be dead.

289
00:23:35,661 --> 00:23:38,061
Or worse, infected.

290
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:40,222
So with all due
respect to God...

291
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:52,209
You're wasting your time.

292
00:23:52,745 --> 00:23:55,942
No, no, no, you are not
cutting me out of this.

293
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:57,777
I am the one that
came and got you.

294
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,078
People in this town don't think
you can keep them safe here.

295
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:05,349
What makes you think
you'll do any good out there?

296
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:22,139
You any good with a gun?

297
00:24:22,274 --> 00:24:23,866
Better than I am with a knife.

298
00:24:25,477 --> 00:24:26,705
We leave at dawn.

299
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:28,041
All right.

300
00:24:30,282 --> 00:24:34,378
What's with all the bullets, anyways?
I thought Priests didn't use firearms.

301
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:35,884
We don't.

302
00:24:37,256 --> 00:24:38,382
They're for you.

303
00:24:44,763 --> 00:24:46,230
ORELAS: (ON PA)
God protects you.

304
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:48,433
The Church protects you.

305
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:01,971
ORELAS: You have been called
to serve once more.

306
00:25:02,347 --> 00:25:06,511
One of your own
has broken his sacred vow.

307
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:09,613
His actions are a threat
to the entire Order.

308
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:16,586
You will find him
and bring him back to me.

309
00:25:18,096 --> 00:25:20,030
Dead or alive.

310
00:25:28,106 --> 00:25:32,668
PREACHER: "And I will teach transgressors
your ways, and sinners will turn back to you.

311
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:36,337
"Save me from bloodguilt,
O God, the God who saves me.

312
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:39,541
"And my tongue will sing
of your righteousness.

313
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:41,653
"And my mouth will
declare your praise.

314
00:25:42,054 --> 00:25:45,455
"You do not delight in
sacrifice or I would bring it.

315
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:47,990
"You do not take pleasure
in burnt offerings."

316
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:13,511
What is it?

317
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:17,721
Vampire tracks are random.
Sets of two, three, four prints at a time.

318
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:19,085
But these are two by two.

319
00:26:19,224 --> 00:26:21,192
It must have been
one of the Familiars.

320
00:26:21,393 --> 00:26:24,851
Vampires don't bring Familiars on the hunt.
They slow them down.

321
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:27,164
No, this...

322
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:31,331
This was something else.

323
00:26:32,905 --> 00:26:34,668
Tracks head north.

324
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,740
There's a reservation
up that way.

325
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:39,104
Well, then that's

01:02:51,681 --> 01:02:53,706
She was just a baby
when the Clergy took me.

You're lying. I knew Owen.

652
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,514
The child needed a father.

We all made sacrifices.

Hicks,

655
01:03:10,266 --> 01:03:11,756
if you do this,

656
01:03:13,103 --> 01:03:15,571
it won't matter
if you find Lucy.

657
01:03:16,706 --> 01:03:20,699
You won't stop the train, and
you won't be able to save her.

658
01:03:23,346 --> 01:03:24,608
You won't save her.

659
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:37,354
We ride out
and meet this together.

When the time comes, you blow the
tracks, then you get out of there!

661
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:01,982
What if you're still
on the train?

662
01:04:11,928 --> 01:04:12,986
Good luck.

No!

In the depths of that hive,

672
01:06:38,308 --> 01:06:42,210
I crossed the threshold
between life and death.

673
01:06:42,445 --> 01:06:44,106
And do you know what I found?

674
01:06:46,816 --> 01:06:50,718
The Queen we had come to kill,
my angel of mercy,

675
01:06:52,722 --> 01:06:56,715
she turned me into something that
had never existed in this world,

676
01:06:58,828 --> 01:07:00,989
a human vampire.

677
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:04,258
Join me.

678
01:07:04,634 --> 01:07:06,829
Accept the blood of the Queen,

679
01:07:06,936 --> 01:07:12,067
and together, we can return
to the Cities as brothers.

680
01:07:13,076 --> 01:07:14,600
Where's my daughter?

681

They took her to the front.
