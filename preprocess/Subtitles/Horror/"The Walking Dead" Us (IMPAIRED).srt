<i>Dr. Eugene Porter

He's a persistent son of a bitch,
saving the world is just more important.

00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,377
<i>I'm well aware</i>
<i>it sounds bananas.</i>

14
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:35,482
But looking at the fossil
record, knowing what I know

15
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:37,584
about this infection,
you cannot say for certain

16
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:40,022
it isn't what killed off
the dinosaurs.

17
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:42,696
Now, do I believe
that's what happened?

18
00:00:42,698 --> 00:00:44,569
No.

19
00:00:44,571 --> 00:00:47,407
But it's enjoyable as hell to
think about an undead ankylosaur

20
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:49,345
going after a diplodocus.

21
00:00:49,347 --> 00:00:52,152
That there is a video game
worth a preorder.

22
00:00:52,154 --> 00:00:54,326
Oh, hell, yeah.
Score.

23
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,699
A few more of those,
a little aluminum foil

24
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:01,170
and some bleach, you got
yourself some volts, sister.

25
00:01:01,172 --> 00:01:03,205
Homemade battery.

26
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:06,511
- Here.
- For reals?

27
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:08,078
You don't want it?

28
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,714
For reals.

29
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:11,615
Much obliged.

30
00:01:11,617 --> 00:01:13,919
Speaking of video games,
what kind of gamer were you?

31
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:16,556
RPGs, shmup, sim racing?

32
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:27,234
( sighs )

33
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:38,985
Go to sleep.
I got this.

34
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:42,490
No offense, but I'm not leaving
Eugene's life in your hands.

35
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:44,693
You came with us
because you wanted help.

36
00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:47,433
You're support, not point.

37
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:52,240
We'll move north with you till I find
the right vehicle just off the tracks.

38
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:53,742
Then five becomes three.

39
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:56,647
Or two.

40
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,649
We each have our missions.

41
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,972
You need to get some sleep.

42
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:15,047
I haven't seen you do it yet.

43
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:20,689
( chuckles )

44
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,195
Thought it was because
you were in love with him.

45
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:26,897
( chuckles )

46
00:02:28,502 --> 00:02:30,271
A girl in love with a guy

47
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:32,840
she's trying to help
get to his girl.

48
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:37,111
If that were the case...

49
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:42,719
closing your eyes would be
just too damn tragic.

50
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,256
- If that were the case.
- Yeah.

51
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:49,392
I saw the way you were
looking down Rosita's shirt

52
00:02:49,394 --> 00:02:52,629
while she was
serving you dinner.

53
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,098
Hey, the things
are damn near hypnotic.

54
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,133
( laughs )

55
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:00,432
Look, Eugene spends half the
day staring at her ass.

56
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:04,271
I'm not mad, it just means
my theory's shot.

57
00:03:04,273 --> 00:03:06,374
I'm awfully sorry about that.

58
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:08,706
Well, I'm right and I'm wrong.

59
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:12,572
Something you did
or something you didn't do?

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,841
Something I did.

61
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:27,518
You were in the army.

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,557
I get the whole gung ho,

63
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,860
mission is your life bullshit.

64
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:33,795
Yeah, you do.

65
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,798
Yeah.

66
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:39,370
So we both got our reasons.

67
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:41,072
Both got our missions.

68
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:47,716
What do you do
when the mission's over?

69
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,753
Eugene: Been rubbing
me wrong, is all.

70
00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:57,890
I'm an even-Steven
type gentleman.

71
00:03:57,892 --> 00:04:00,124
You help me find the supplies,
we'll share the battery

72
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:02,726
and whatever juice we scare
up, minimal as it may be.

73
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:04,627
Deal?

74
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:27,531

I didn't think he had the

He don't.
Dude left his stuff here.

Yeah, you're right.

96
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:47,650
Shouldn't be fooling around.

97
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:49,986
We should probably--
Carl!

98
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:54,093
I win.

99
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:56,061
Pay up.

Been out here since

You see, the rules of the hunt

115
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:19,576
don't mean jack out here.

116
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:21,711
Now, that rabbit you're holding

117
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:24,178
is claimed, boy.

118
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:29,647
Claimed whether
you like it or not.

119
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:32,183
So I was you, I'd hand it over.

you ain't never even
got out of bed this morning.

122

It ain't yours.

this bitch

00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,495
Am I right?

127
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:52,530
Got you walking around here
like a dead man

128
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,534
who just lost himself
a piece of tail.

129
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,104
Must have been a good'un.

130
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:00,338
Tell me something.

131
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:03,539
Was it one of the little'uns?

132
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,249
'Cause they don't last
too long out here.

133
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,253
- Easy, fellas, easy.
- ( laughing )

134
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:15,023
Let's just put
our weapons down.

135
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:17,560
See if we can't figure out what's
really the problem here, huh?

136
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:23,102
- Did you claim it?
- Hell, yeah.

137
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:27,538
Well, there you go.
That critter belongs to Len.

138
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,339
So let's have it.

139
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:35,581
Looks like you may be
wanting an explanation.

140
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:39,248
See, going it alone, that
ain't an option nowadays.

141
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,916
Still, it is survival
of the fittest.

142
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,886
That's a paradox right there.

143
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:47,157
So I laid out
some rules of the road

144
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,626
to keep things from going
Darwin every couple hours.

145
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:51,795
Keep our merry band
together and stress-free.

146
00:09:53,098 --> 00:09:55,598
All you got to do is claim.

147
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,663
That's how you mark
your territory,

148
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,365
your prey, your bed at night.

149
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:01,735
One word, claimed.

150
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:04,136
I ain't claiming nothing.

151
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,239
We're gonna teach him, right?

152
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,814
The rules say
we got to teach him.

153
00:10:13,116 --> 00:10:15,515
It wouldn't be fair
to punish you

154
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:17,447
for violating a rule
you never even knew existed.

155
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:19,350
There ain't no rules no more.

156
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,985
Oh, there are.
You know that.

157
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:24,654
That's why I didn't kill
you for the crossbow.

158
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,126
- Hey.
- Easy there, partner.

159
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:44,519
Claimed.

160
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:46,888
That's all you got to say.

161
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,222
Hey, ass end is still an end.

162
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:08,478
Hold up!

163

00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:54,744
Glenn.
What are you doing?

326
00:23:54,746 --> 00:23:57,715
- She's not one of them.
- What?

327
00:24:01,152 --> 00:24:02,652
There's no bodies
on the ground.

328
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:04,890
That means Maggie
made it through.

329
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:07,594
She made it through.

330
00:24:09,897 --> 00:24:12,299
We have to get rid of them.

331
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:14,669
- <i> We don't have enough ammo.</i>
- Then we'll push through.

332
00:24:14,671 --> 00:24:17,039
We have to find another way.

333
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:29,016
( exhales )

334
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:31,020
( snarling )

335
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:33,054
( pounding )

336
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:37,355
You got him?

337
00:24:38,356 --> 00:24:39,890
I got her.

338
00:24:53,144 --> 00:24:56,012
<i>( engine starts )</i>

339
00:24:56,014 --> 00:24:58,115
Gonna need to air
this baby out.

340
00:24:58,117 --> 00:25:01,819
Good, it'll give us some time to
figure out how to get back on track.

341
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:06,201
_

342
00:25:16,504 --> 00:25:18,338
- Yo, no, no.
- I'm the navigator.

343
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,672
Then learn to navigate.

344
00:25:20,674 --> 00:25:22,873
Remember Thompson?

345
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:27,013
I'm formally requesting a
straight up do-over on that one.

346
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:30,249
I guided us here from Houston to
northern Georgia without incident.

347
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:32,214
I wouldn't say
without incident.

348
00:25:32,216 --> 00:25:33,849
Minimal incident.

349
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:35,352
Navigation-wise,
at least.

350
00:25:38,924 --> 00:25:40,793
Please?

351
00:25:40,795 --> 00:25:42,897
I cannot abide a reality

352
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:45,903
where you are the chosen navigator
over a son of the South

353
00:25:45,905 --> 00:25:48,172
who has successfully
negotiated the travails

354
00:25:48,174 --> 00:25:50,472
and vagaries of journeys
both real and virtual.

355
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:59,784
All right.

356
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:02,118
We're going north.
Got it?

357
00:26:05,124 --> 00:26:07,227
( snarling )

358
00:26:54,496 --> 00:26:57,999
Tara. What is it?
What is it?

359
00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:00,870
I can't--
( grunting )

360
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:07,072
Get up, get up, get up.

361
00:27:14,803 --> 00:27:16,436
Eugene:
<i>Turn left up here.</i>

362
00:27:16,438 --> 00:27:17,972
This is the third left turn

363
00:27:17,974 --> 00:27:20,242
you've made me make
in the last five minutes.

364
00:27:20,244 --> 00:27:22,511
- You're lost.
- I'm not.

365
00:27:22,513 --> 00:27:24,513
Turn left.

366
00:27:25,982 --> 00:27:27,685
If you're lost,
please just tell me.

367
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,725
The gas in this tank
is worth more than your ego.

368
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:32,561
If you want to talk fuel
efficiency, we could talk--

369
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:34,399
We are not rolling up
the windows.

370
00:27:34,401 --> 00:27:36,837
- It smells like a damn carcass in here.
- Stop the van.

371
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:41,342
Why are we stopping?

372
00:27:48,788 --> 00:27:51,055
( in Spanish )
Liar.

373
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:53,427
Ugh, liar!

374
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:54,964
Nope.

375
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:56,800
This wasn't your plan?

376
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:58,602
Why you insisted on navigating?

377
00:27:58,604 --> 00:28:00,237
Why you told him
to go to sleep?

378
00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:02,472
Nope. I never
claimed otherwise.

379
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:04,473
Now how about you
apologize for the slander

380
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,040
and we call it square?

381
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:09,076
What the hell
is wrong with you?

382
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:10,977
If Glenn and Tara
were still alive

383
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:12,846
and there were
no significant delays

384
00:28:12,848 --> 00:28:15,682
and they continued traveling at
approximately three miles per hour

385
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:18,651
and I timed it
correctly in my head,

386
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:20,418
they might be
somewhere around here.

387
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,089
Those two are not the priority.

388
00:28:23,091 --> 00:28:26,396
The only priority is
getting you to Washington.

389
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:28,964
After I save the world,

390
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:31,101
I still have to live
with myself.

391
00:28:32,537 --> 00:28:34,603
I'm not leaving them behind.

392
00:28:35,904 --> 00:28:38,706
Oh!
Son of a bitch!

393
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:41,913
Why the hell are we stopped?

394
00:28:41,915 --> 00:28:44,382
If they made it out of that tunnel,
they'd be somewhere around here.

395
00:28:44,384 --> 00:28:46,846
You're kidding me, right?

396
00:28:46,848 --> 00:28:49,516
What's your problem?

397
00:28:49,518 --> 00:28:51,452
- My problem?
- You're the one in the driver's seat.

398
00:28:51,454 --> 00:28:53,589
You're the one who put
your damn foot on the brake.

399
00:28:53,591 --> 00:28:56,787
- He told me to stop.
- You don't stop! You never stop!

400
00:28:56,789 --> 00:28:59,659
- I know the rules. - If you know
the rules, the rule is never stop!

401
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:01,763
- When you stop...
- Guys!

402
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:03,798
- Guys!
- Both: What?

403
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:08,969
Len: <i>You've got
to be kidding me.</i>

404
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:11,675
<i>Christ.</i>

405
00:29:11,677 --> 00:29:13,675
Give it here.

406
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:15,610
You step back.

407
00:29:15,612 --> 00:29:18,143
My half was in the bag.
Now it's gone.

408
00:29:18,145 --> 00:29:21,213
Now ain't nobody
around here interested

409
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:25,115
in no half a damn cottontail except you.
Ain't that right?

410
00:29:25,117 --> 00:29:27,018
You're the only one still
thinking about that crap.

411
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,757
- Empty your bag.
- I said step back.

412
00:29:37,602 --> 00:29:40,504
Did you take his rabbit, Daryl?

413
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:42,572
Just tell me the truth.

414
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:44,306
I didn't take nothing.

415
00:29:44,308 --> 00:29:46,141
Joe:
<i>What do we got here?</i>

416
00:29:47,975 --> 00:29:49,742
Come on.

417
00:29:52,877 --> 00:29:56,348
- <i> Well, look at that.</i>
- You put that there, didn't you?

418
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,083
When I went out to take a piss.

419
00:29:58,085 --> 00:29:59,582
- You lied.
- Didn't you?

420
00:29:59,584 --> 00:30:02,452
You lied.
You stole.

421
00:30:02,454 --> 00:30:05,824
- We gonna teach this fool or what, Joe?
- Whoa, whoa.

422
00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:08,792
Now, Daryl says he didn't
take your half of the rabbit.

423
00:30:08,794 --> 00:30:10,495
So we got a little
conundrum here.

424
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:11,997
Either he's lying,

425
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:14,434
which is an actionable offense,

426
00:30:14,436 --> 00:30:17,337
or...
( laughs )

427
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:21,112
or you didn't plant it
on him like some pussy,

428
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:24,012
punk-ass, cheating,
coward cop, did you?

429
00:30:24,014 --> 00:30:27,717
'Cause while that wouldn't be
specifically breaking the rules,

430
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:30,084
it'd be disappointing.

431
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:32,254
- It would.
- Mm-hmm.

432
00:30:32,256 --> 00:30:34,557
- I didn't.
- Good.

433
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,426
Well...

434
00:30:37,428 --> 00:30:40,562
- ( groans )
- ...teach him a lesson, gents.

435
00:30:40,564 --> 00:30:43,032
He's a lying sack of shit.
I'm sick of it.

436
00:30:43,034 --> 00:30:45,035
<i>Teach him all the way.</i>

437
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:49,072
I saw him do it.

438
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:50,573
Why didn't you try to stop him?

439
00:30:50,575 --> 00:30:54,279
He wanted to play that out.
I let him.

440
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:56,582
You told the truth.

441
00:30:56,584 --> 00:30:58,648
He lied.

442
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,550
You understand the rules.

443
00:31:00,552 --> 00:31:02,083
He doesn't.

444
00:31:02,085 --> 00:31:04,519
- <i> ( blows landing )</i>
- <i> ( Len groaning )</i>

445
00:31:06,188 --> 00:31:08,487
Looks like you get
the head, too.

446
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:22,394
( straining )

447
00:31:22,396 --> 00:31:23,762
( panting )

448
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:29,298
Go. Go.

449
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,036
Find Maggie.
Go find Maggie.

450
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:33,969
No, no.

451
00:31:33,971 --> 00:31:37,202
- No.
- Glenn, you can't save me.

452
00:31:37,204 --> 00:31:38,804
( straining )

453
00:31:38,806 --> 00:31:40,740
Even if you got this
off me, I can't run.

454
00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:42,775
And if you help me,
they're gonna get both of us.

455
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:45,576
There's got to be a way.
There's got to be a different way.

456
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:47,644
<i>Glenn, they're coming.</i>

457
00:31:47,646 --> 00:31:49,613
I'm not leaving.
I'm not leaving you!

458
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:52,650
Get out of here!

459
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:54,251
Go!

460
00:31:56,387 --> 00:31:58,454
No.

461
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,265
( gun clicking )

462
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:10,170
Come on!

463
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,407
- <i> ( engine revving )</i>
- Come on!

464
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:15,775
- <i> ( tires squeal )</i>
- <i> ( gunfire )</i>

465
00:32:15,777 --> 00:32:17,613
Abraham:
<i>Get down!</i>

466
00:32:17,615 --> 00:32:19,182
( gunfire )

467
00:32:44,772 --> 00:32:47,309
( crying )

468
00:32:50,716 --> 00:32:52,984
Oh, my God.

469
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:05,435
Hi.

470
00:33:05,437 --> 00:33:07,204
Hi.

471
00:33:20,354 --> 00:33:22,353
God, you are so beautiful.

472
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:27,420
- How'd it go?
- End of the tunnel's secure.

473
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,121
If anything tries to come in,
we'll hear in plenty of time.

474
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:32,055
We didn't get
to officially meet.

475
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:35,353
Oh, I'm sorry.
Tara, this is Maggie.

476
00:33:35,355 --> 00:33:37,020
- <i> Maggie, Tara.</i>
- Hi.

477
00:33:37,022 --> 00:33:38,856
Hi.

478
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,188
He's a big fan of yours.

479
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,959
I met Tara on the road.

480
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:50,127
Couldn't have made it
here without her.

481
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,664
Thank you.

482
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,174
When she heard what I was doing,
she said she had to help me.

483
00:34:02,176 --> 00:34:03,809
She's just that kind of person.

484
00:34:22,222 --> 00:34:23,688
What's up?

485
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,491
He just said

486
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:29,028
that he knows
what caused the outbreak.

487
00:34:30,865 --> 00:34:32,832
Yeah.

488
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:36,632
He does.

489
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:39,868
Let me guess. He asked you
to go to DC with him?

490
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,669
I'm downright tickled
y'all found each other.

491
00:34:42,671 --> 00:34:46,341
Should spend the rest
of the night celebrating.

492
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:49,581
Because tomorrow there's
absolutely no reason

493
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:51,216
why the eight of us
don't stuff ourselves

494
00:34:51,218 --> 00:34:52,918
in that van and head up
to Washington.

495
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,359
Tara:
<i>He's right.</i>

496
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:58,361
I'm gonna go.

497
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:00,932
No, he's wrong.

498
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:04,439
We're 55% of the way
from Houston to Washington.

499
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:06,675
Up until now, we've had an
armored military vehicle

500
00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:08,245
for transport
and we lost eight people.

501
00:35:08,247 --> 00:35:11,546
- That wasn't our fault.
- They're gone.

502
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:13,214
Eugene: <i>I can't imagine
we'd have better luck</i>

503
00:35:13,216 --> 00:35:15,784
<i>with that grocery grabber</i>
<i>we picked up.</i>

504
00:35:15,786 --> 00:35:17,518
We're a day's walk
from Terminus.

505
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,584
Who knows what
they've got there?

506
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:21,919
Rosita: <i>Look, it
couldn't hurt to check.</i>

507
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:26,457
Load up on supplies, maybe even
recruit some of them to come with.

508
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:30,127
I'll go with you guys,
but after.

509
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,895
I have to see Terminus.

510
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,933
My brother could be there.

511
00:35:35,935 --> 00:35:37,967
I got to know.

512
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,536
Me, too.

513
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,473
On both counts.

514
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:46,974
He tells me I'm wrong...

515
00:35:51,045 --> 00:35:53,716
I listen.

516
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,117
Tomorrow we go
to the end of the line.

517
00:35:58,086 --> 00:35:59,921
Then Washington.

518
00:36:02,591 --> 00:36:04,092
I can't believe it.

519
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:06,761
I know.
We were right over there.

520
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:09,261
A whole swarm of them
came at us.

521
00:36:11,098 --> 00:36:13,465
And we didn't have
enough bullets.

522
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:18,869
I tried to think what you
would do if you were here.

523
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:23,072
So I just emptied my clip
into the ceiling

524
00:36:23,074 --> 00:36:24,507
and I hoped for the best.

525
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:26,610
That's unreal.

526
00:36:26,612 --> 00:36:28,445
Kind of like asking
those guys to hold off

527
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:30,143
saving the world while you
go look for your wife?

528
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:31,810
( laughs )

529
00:36:31,812 --> 00:36:34,146
I'm a persuasive guy.

530
00:36:34,148 --> 00:36:35,781
Yeah.

531
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:11,403
Whoa, hey.
What are you doing?

532
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:13,271
Sorry.

533
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,708
This is the only picture
I have of you.

534
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:19,011
You don't need a picture of me.

535
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,181
You never will again.

536
00:37:40,172 --> 00:37:42,173
<i>( loud clang )</i>

537
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:56,558
<i>( door opens )</i>

538
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:39,376
White Lightning.

539
00:38:39,378 --> 00:38:41,947
Easiest thing to make with the
least amount of supplies.

540
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:44,049
I'd start slow if I was you.

541
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:46,715
Your stomach's probably
emptier than you think.

542
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,282
Mmm.

543
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:52,450
I ain't been lit at dawn since

544
00:38:52,452 --> 00:38:55,018
before everything fell apart.

545
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,920
Fell apart. I never
looked at it like that.

546
00:38:57,922 --> 00:39:01,221
Seems to me like things are finally
starting to fall together.

547
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,659
At least for guys like us.

548
00:39:05,661 --> 00:39:08,228
Living like this, surviving.

549
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,131
We've been doing this
from the start, right?

550
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:14,668
Getting closer.

551
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:26,784
You seen this before?

552
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:28,486
Oh, yeah.

553
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:31,055
I'll tell you what it is.
It's a lie.

554
00:39:31,057 --> 00:39:34,125
Ain't no sanctuary for all.

555
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:37,698
Ain't gonna welcome guys like
you and me with open arms.

556
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:41,534
Daryl: <i>So is that
where we're headed?</i>

557
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:44,505
- So now you're asking?
- That's right.

558
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,309
We were in a house
minding our own business

559
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:51,711
and this walking
piece of fecal matter

560
00:39:51,713 --> 00:39:53,613
was hiding in the home.

561
00:39:53,615 --> 00:39:57,050
Strangled our colleague Lou
and left him to turn.

562
00:39:57,052 --> 00:39:59,520
Lou came at all of us.

563
00:40:01,556 --> 00:40:03,222
He lit out.

564
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:05,492
We tracked him to these tracks,

565
00:40:05,494 --> 00:40:08,897
one of those signs, and thus
we've got a destination in mind.

566
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:11,762
- You see his face?
- Only Tony.

567
00:40:11,764 --> 00:40:13,062
That's enough for a reckoning.

568
00:40:17,535 --> 00:40:19,035
Claimed.

569

Hi. I'm Mary.

Looks like you've been
on the road a while.

596
00:42:42,506 --> 00:42:44,338
We have.

597
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,839
Let's get you settled
and we'll make you a plate.

Welcome to Terminus.
