167
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,485
[Katherine]
Heavens bless us!

168
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,206
[dog barking]

169
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,123
Caleb, hold the gate.

170
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,770
Caleb!

171
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,047
[growling]
Get in!

172
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,846
Oh.

173
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,888
[laughing]

174
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,647
I'll have thee quiet.

175
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,087
Wither were you
and Caleb this morn?

176
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,400
How could you disappear?

177
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,326
And thee, I told thee to keep
watch of Jonas and Mercy.

178
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,006
I was, and I bade them help me
and they paid me no mind.

179
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,321
- I was a-getting...
- What's the matter with thee, Thomasin?

180
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,402
What is the matter with thee?

181
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,324
Take thy father's rags to
the brook and wash them.

182
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,290
- They would pay me no mind.
- And brush out his woolens.

183
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,646
Help him!

184
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,925
Wee one, it gave me such
a fright to find thee gone.

185
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,889
I will not be left here alone.
Dost hear?

186
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,966
A morning's work
is well behindhand.

187
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,168
Jonas, leave thy sister be.

188
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,965
- She likes it.
- William.

189
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,486
What, can't a father spend
Godly time with his son?

190
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,800
Jonas!

191
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,486
- Father said stop it.
- Thomasin!

192
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,164
- Stop.
- Stop it!

193
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,169
Each of ya, stop it.

194
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,850
Thomasin, take the twins inside.

195
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,604
[both]
No!

196
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,327
Get inside, get inside, get inside.

197
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,801
As you like.

198
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,726
We went to find apples!

199
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,171
In the valley.

200
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,011
I thought I seen an apple tree
in the valley.

201
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,084
Father brought the gun,
for if we glanced that wolf--

202
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,447
Why did you not tell me?

203
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,921
Father wanted it a surprise,
to cheer you, and...

204
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,931
but there were none.

205
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,849
I thought I seen em.

206
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,528
[Sigh]

207
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,521
I like you not outside
the farm, even to the valley.

208
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,841
Dost hear me?

209
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,447
Caleb, be a good lad
and get some water for thy Mother.

210
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,370
Stray not from the brook.

211
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,124
Why are you dallying?

212
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,045
What then?

213
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,005
What?

214
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,602
Caleb? Caleb!

215
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,560
Stop it.

216
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,603
I meant no harm in it.

217
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,404
What's the matter with thee?

218
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,760
Come hither.

219
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,570
What's the matter with thee, eh?

220
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,246
Shh.

221
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,241
I've seen no apples
since we went from England.

222
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,448
I would thou hadst found them.

223
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,204
I so wish for one.

224
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,611
[makes biting sound]

225
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,250

[rustling]

227
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,080
Hear that?

228
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,491
Aye.

229
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,960
Who's there?

230
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,042
[Mercy]
I be the Witch of the Wood!

231
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,565
Mercy, come out.

232
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,324
I be not Mercy,

233
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,451
I be the Witch of the Wood
and I have come to steal ye.

234
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,444
Hear me stick
a-flying through the trees:

235
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,251
Clickety-clackity,
clickety-clackity!

236
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,448
- Mercy!
- Clickety-clackity.

237
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,931
Why is't when thou dost a wrong,

238
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,128
I be a-washin Father's clothes
like a slave,

239
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,851
- and thou art playing idle?
- Because Mother hates you.

240
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,571
Spoilt child. I'll tell Mother
you've left the farm alone.

241
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,802
Black Phillip saith
I can do what I like.

242
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,331
Devil take your Black Phillip.

243
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,482
It's your fault I can't leave the yard.

244
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,882
I could go to the brook
before you let The Witch take Sam.

245
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,042
- Quiet, thee.
- It were a wolf stole Sam.

246
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,363
A witch. I've seen her in her
riding cloak, about the wood.

247
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,165
- Father showed me the tracks.
- It was a witch.

248
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,009
Aye, it was a witch,
Mercy, you speak aright.

249
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,684
- Thomasin!
- It was I.

250
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,091
Liar.

251
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,563
Twas I what stole him,
I be the witch of the wood.

252
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,689
- Liar! Liar!
- I am.

253
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,524
List not to her, Mercy.

254
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,807
I am that very witch.

255
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,362
When I sleep, my spirit slips
away from my body

256
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,205
and dances naked with The Devil.

257
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,886
- That's how I signed his book.
- No.

258
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,122
He bade me bring him an
unbaptized babe,

259
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,364
so I stole Sam
and I gave him to me master.

260
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,728
And I'll make any man
or thing else vanish I like.

261
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,529
- No.
- Aye.

262
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,682
And I'll vanish thee, too,
if thou displeaseth me.

263
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,525
- Be quiet!
- Mercy, she's but telling fantasies.

264
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,729
Perchance I boil and bake thee
since we're lack of food.

265
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,928
- No!
- Stop, Thomasin!

266
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,843
- I'ts not true!
- It is, thou thing!

267
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,843
How I crave to sink my teeth
into thy pink flesh.

268
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,921
[screaming]

269
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,843
If ever thou tellst thy Mother of this,

270
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,127
I'll witch thee and thy Mother!
And Jonas too!

271
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,168
- Caleb!
- Stop thy tears and swear by silence.

272
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,402
- I swear it.
- You'll not tell Mother nor father.

273
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,086
- I swear.
- Thomasin! Let her alone.

274
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,562
Get away from her, Caleb,
or she'll witch thee!

275
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,329
Why tell Mercy
those horrible fantasies?

276
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,089
- Dost thou hate me now too?
- It was a wolf stole Sam.

277
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,449
Leave me be. Go tell Mother
and father of my wickedness.

278
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,320
- Thomasin...
- I hate thy pity. I need it not.

279
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,924
And forgive us the sins we have
this day committed against thee,

280
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,721
free us from the shame and torment
which are due unto us, Father.

281
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,327
We beseech thee, increase our faith
in the promise of the Gospel,

282
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,246
our fear of thy name
and the hatred of all our sins,

283
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,802
that we may be assured that
the Holy Spirit dwells in us.

284
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,123
That we might be thy children
in thy love and mercy,

285
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,851
but as we hunger
for this food of our bodies

286
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,766
so our souls hunger
for the food of eternal life.

287
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,289
Finish soon our days of sin,
and bring us to eternal peace

288
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,971
through the purifying
blood of Thy Son,

289
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,284
our Lord and only Savior
Jesus Christ.

290
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,966
- Amen.
- [All] Amen.

291
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,327
Thomasin, what's thou done
with the silver cup?

292
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,406
[Thomasin]
Is't not on the shelf?

293
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,323
Nay-

294
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,486
In the six board, then.

295
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,609
T'ain't there neither.

296
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,286
It's been disappeared
for some while.

297
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,606
Didst lose it?

298
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,731
I've not touched it.

299
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,844
Where has it gone then?

300
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,160
[Thomasin]
I haven't touched it.

301
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,208
[Katherine] I've caught thee
trifling with it before.

302
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,851
She says she haven't touched it,
Katherine.

303
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,409
How thou couldst lose my father's
silver wine cup in this hovel,

304
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,845
- I cannot know.
- I haven't touched it.

305
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,764
Peace, child. It's gone.

306
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,967
Did a wolf vanish that too?

307
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,243
She haven't touched it, Katherine.

308
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,245
What is amiss
on this farm? Hmm?

309
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,600
It is not natural.

310
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,484
Caleb, will thou read out
a chapter of the Word tonight?

311
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,207
We must find some light
in our darkness.

312
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,807
Tomorrow we will have a fast day
but for our sins.

313

[sheep bleating]

314
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,410
Thomasin, dist not bed them down
before supper?

315
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,211
Baah, baah.

316

Oh, Holy and blessed Spirit,
be with me and dwell in me heart.

321
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,647
You must sleep tonight, Kate.

322
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,964
This night and evermore, amen.

323
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,087
Thou dost remember I love thee?

324

00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,011
I do.

326
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,401
List me, Kate,

327
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,724
I fear thou dost look
too much upon this affliction.

328
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,081
We must turn our thoughts
towards God, not to ourselves.

329
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,601
He hath never taken a child from us.
Never a one, Kate.

330
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,490
Who might earn such grace?

331
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,766
We have been
grateful of God's love.

332
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,209
[Katherine]
He hath cursed this family.

333
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,566
No.

334
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,441
He hath taken us
into a very low condition to humble us

335
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,048
and to show us more of His grace.

336
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,129
Was not Christ lead into the wilderness
to be ill met by the Devil?

337
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,162
We should ne'er have left
the plantation.

338
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,571
Kate.

339
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,325
- We should never have left!
- That damned church.

340
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,769
- There's naught hither!
- Well, what need we? Silver chalices?

341
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,762
How dare you chide me on a cup?

342
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,083
Tis not for vanity
that I am grieved of it.

343
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,208
[sniffing]

344
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,605
Katherine, I must tell thee--

345
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,206
- We might have sold it.
- What?

346
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,001
What fool would trade for our corn?

347
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,610
[sniffing]

348
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:04,050
List me, our daughter hath beget
the sign of her womanhood.

349
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,843
Thomasin? Caleb?

350
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,241
Are you abed?

351
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,288
Mercy?

352
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,520
Jonas?

353
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,571
She's old enough.
She must leave to serve another family.

354
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,644
[William] Twas not her fault.
Kate, I must tell thee...

355
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,769
[Katherine] Aye, it was thine
for taking thy family hither.

356
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,171
[William]
This is Godly land.

357
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,685
[Katherine]
Godly?

358
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,649
Our children are being fostered up
like savages.

359
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,960
[William]
Kate!

360
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,203
[Katherine] How oft I begged and begged
thee to take Samuel for baptism?

361
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,760
[William] They'd not baptize
outside the congregation.

362
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,729
[Katherine]
Our Sam is in hell!

363
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,644
[William]
Go to.

364
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,522
[Katherine]
God save us, Caleb is well.

365
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,523
[William] We must keep him still.
And Thomasin.

366
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,965
[Katherine]
Our corn is trash!

367
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,088
[William]
We cannot back to that church.

368
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,571
[Katherine]
We will starve!

369
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:02,083
[William] Peace, peace.
You'll wake them, peace.

370
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,050
[Katherine crying throughout]

371
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,487
[William] I'll to the village
with the horse and Thomasin tomorrow.

372
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,006
The Tildens or the Whythings,

373
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,651
they can make use of her.

374
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,644
They're good folk.

375
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,963
Stop, Kate.

376
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,766
We will find food, I know it.

377
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,724
[Thomasin]
Caleb?

378
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,440
What are you doing?

379
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,090
Go to sleep.

380
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,447
What is this?
Tell me, now.

381
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,205
- Running away then?
- No.

382
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,044
- Lie not to me.
- I don't.

383
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,691
Then what?

384
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,250
Tell me!

385
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,120
If thou went back to sleep
and kept silent of this,

386
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,531
I promise thee,

387
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,242
you'll need not leave to serve
the Tildens nor any family else.

388
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,766
I'll be back by mid-day.

389
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,646
- Well, let me along with ya.
- No.

390
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,326
- Let me along.
- I cannot.

391
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,203
If you don't let me along with ya,

392
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,129
I'll wake Mother
and father this instant.

393
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,890
Well?

394
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,370
Aye, but we did!

395
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,090
- Nay.
- We did!

396
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,969
No.

397
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,451
We had glass windows in England.

398
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,961
We haven't been hither
so long you can forget that.

399
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,644
As you like, Thomasin?

400
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,961
You've gone mad.

401
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,964
Dost not remember Fowler
laying on the floor in the sun?

402
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,805
- You must!
- Nay.

403
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,282
And where the sun would shine,
would he warm himself.

404
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,409
Remember once he lay upon the table,
and father saw him and he saith,

405
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,289
"We will have him for meat!

406
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,011
Kate! Kate!
We will roast this beast."

407
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,651
You must remember that!

408
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,248
[Caleb] I remember that day,
but no glass.

409
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,722
Well... it was pretty.

410
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,531
[dog barking]

411
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,004
What is't, boy?

412
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,647
[Caleb] Burt, calm thee!

413
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,451
Fowler! Nay, Fowler!

414
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,725
Stand here with Burt.

415
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,646
- Caleb, no.
- I'll straight back.

416
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,768
He's gone mad!

417
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,046
[yelps]

418
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,322
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

419
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,129
- Thomasin!
- Thomasin!

420
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,564
- Caleb!
- Caleb!

421
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,567
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

422
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,450
[William] Thomasin!

423
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,366
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

424
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,088
[heavy breathing]

425
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,686
Thomasin!

[attempted whistling]

427
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,208
Fowler!

428
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,362
[heavy breathing]

429
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,161
O God, my Lord, I now begin,
O help me and I'll leave my sin.

430
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,727
For I repentant now shall be,
From evil I will turn to Thee.

431
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,367
None ever shall destroy my faith,
nor do I mind what Satan saith.

432
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,161
O God, my Lord, I now begin,
O, help me and I'll leave my sin,

433
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,682
For I repentant now shall be,
from evil I will turn to Thee.

434
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,330
None ever shall destroy my faith,

435
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,368
nor do I mind what Satan saith.

436
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,643
O God, my Lord, I now begin,
O help me and I--

[dog screaming]

439
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,482
<i>Caleb!</i>

440
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,723
<i>Caleb!</i>

441
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,606
- Caleb!
- Father!

442
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,091
Thomasin.

443
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,530
Oh, my girl, my girl.

444
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,088
Where is thy brother?

445
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,565
[thunderstorm]

00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,400
[heavy breathing]

447
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,285
What's the matter with thee, Thomasin?
What's the matter with thee?

448
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,001
I'll set off at first light.
I'll not return until I've found him.

449
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,050
T'would be better to go to the village
to raise up help, I cannot--

450
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,521
[William]
Tis a day's ride and I have no horse.

451
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,125
There's no time to be lost.

452
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,010
Likely you should have left
this morn, then.

453
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,606
You have no gun, William,
nay, not even a dog.

454
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,682
- Be not a fool!
- I am a fool to go.

455
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,161
There is none will help this family.

456
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,927
Let me be!

457
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,440
The moon is bright,
the rain bothers me not.

458
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,404
I'll be back in a two-day,
if any a man will return with me.

459
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,245
- Don't go, Father!
- Enough!

460
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,320
Tell us why you went to the wood.

461
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,801
- I promised.
- I care not!

462
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,608
Let me find favor in your eyes.

463
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,809
Oh, child, tell me and I will!

464
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,840
I, um...

465
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,602
[Katherine]
Speak!

466
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,324
I...

467
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,082
I took thy father's cup.

468
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,164
I sold it.

469
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,882
Forgive me, Kate.
Forgive me, Thomasin.

470
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,840
What is this?

471
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,364
Katherine, I must make confession.

472
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,970
I yestermorn took Caleb
to the wood.

473
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,647
Twas for food,
and the pelts for money, good money.

474
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,722
I knew you were false!
I knew it!

475
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,326
I meant it as a surprise,
that is why I kept secret.

476
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,970
I will trap that wolf, Kate.

477
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,008
You stood by whilst our son lied to me!

478
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,923
Twas for thy sake!
I love thee, Kate.

479
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,571
- You took him to the woods!
- I will find him!

480
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,569
You've broken God's covenant.
You're a liar.

481
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,330
And you've lost another child.

482
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,926
- I will go now.
- You cannot escape the woods.

483
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,525
I Will find him!

484
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,127
And kill thyself too?
Will Jonas be the man of the house?

485
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,202
Will you damn all your family to death?!

486
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,726
- Katherine!
- Let go of me!

487
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,046

Picking apples.

489
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,049
Mother, have the goats
been bedded down yet?

490
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,361
- Nay.
- I'll to it.

491
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,287
Let it wait til the morrow.
They dare not escape with this rain.

492
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,249
[Thomasin]
Nay, I'll to it.

493
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,210
Please you, Mother.

494
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,203
Come hither, child.

495
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,010
Hurry back.

[breathing heavily]

501
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,405
Father!

502
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,970
Caleb, Caleb...

503
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,803
Shh.

504
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,563
[Katherine]
Oh, merciful Father,

505
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,325
both the Lord and giver of life.

506
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,200
Thy sole, Jesus Christ,
we beseech thee.

507
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,282
Look down from Heaven upon him

508
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,284
with those eyes
of grace and compassion.

509
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,044
Pity thy wounded servant...

510
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,122
[rain falling]

511
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:32,131
Baa, baa. Baa, baa, baa.

512
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,771
What ails Caleb, Black Phillip?
What ails him?

513
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,411
Did Thomasin make 'im sick
in the wood?

514
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,766
What say you?

515
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,808
Black Phillip says you are wicked.

516
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,445
Aye, he told me too.

517
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,806
Damn your Black Phillip.

518
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,244
He says you put the Devil
in Caleb, that's why he's sick.

519
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,001
I'd never hurt Caleb,
nor Sam, nor thee.

520
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,923
- You beat me.
- T'was a jest.

521
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,650
- You said you'd eat of me.
- Mercy!

522
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,210
Mother and Father will find out.

523
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,851
- What?
- That you are a witch!

524
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,763
[goats bleat]

525
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,491
Thomasin!

526
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,490
Thomasin?

527
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,846
[Splash]

[Splash]

00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,531
[praying softly]

530
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,840
Dost remember John Kempe's son?

531
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,367
That first winter, he was
tormented of Indian magic.

532
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,249
'Tis not the same.

533
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,530
- This is unnatural providence.
- I know not that.

534
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,841
Look at thy son.

535
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,250
- Will.
- What?

536
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,890
- Think!
- Think what?

537
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,970
- Think!
- I have no thoughts.

538
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,202
Does this not look
like witchcraft?

539
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,850
What witch?

540
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,202
Who does this then? Who?

541
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,527
Thy thoughts are as a child.

542
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,725
What are you doing?

543
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,849
We'll back to the plantation
in the morning.

544
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,124
Find a good family for Thomasin,
take Caleb to the doctor's.

545
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,202
He'll tell if this be
some natural ill or not.

546
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,170
Yet we cannot return as beggars.

547
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,723
I'll scour the field. There must be
some fruit yet untouched by this rot.

548
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,724
I beseech thee, Katherine,
what canst thou do for him presently?

549
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,804
How might we all bare it
to the village with no horse?

550
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,565
Well, the little corn and the goat
should fetch a fair price.

551
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,041
We'll... We'll back with Caleb
and sell them,

552
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,122
return with the horse
for the twins and Thomasin.

553
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,641
- You cannot leave them here!
- Thomasin and thee...

554
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,370
Oh, forget the crop, Will!

555
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,488
What?!

556
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,370
What dost thou want, Katherine?

557
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,966
Tell me and I will give it thee.

558
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,525
I want to be home.

559
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,885
Thou shall be home,
by candle-time tomorrow.

560
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,406
In England.

[Katherine sobs and sighs]

562
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,251
Oh, Will...

563
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,085
I also have a confession to make.

564
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,605
I never meant to be a shrew to thee.

565

[sobs]

566
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,207
I have become as Job's wife,
I know it.

567
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,720
[sobs]

568
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,529
But since Sam, since...

569
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,445
My heart has turned to stone.

570
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,251
[Sigh]

571
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:09,044
I dreamed once,
t'was when I was of Thomasin's years,

572
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,602
that I was with Christ upon Earth.

573
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,642
Oh, I was so very near Him.

574
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,442
And in many tears for the assurance
of the pardon of me sins.

575
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,650
And I was so ravaged
with His love towards me,

576
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,169
I thought it far exceeding
the affection of the kindest husband.

577
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,761
And since Samuel disappeared...

578
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,889
...I have such a sad weakness
of faith, I cannot shake it.

579
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,487
I cannot see Christ's help as near.

580
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,769
I pray and I pray, but I cannot.

581
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:56,007
I fear I cannot ever feel
that same measure of love again.

582
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,891
Thou shall have of it in Heaven.

583
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,604
I'll be in field.

584
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,524
If you can spare a while, do.

585
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,284
We'll leave at dawn.

586
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,124
I promise thee that.

587
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,320

She turned Flora's milk to blood!

She had bade us
keep secret from you!

- It was but a jest to quiet her, I--
- She made bargain with Satan!

00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:25,407
Let us pray,
then we need fear nothing.

648
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,404
We shall never lie open
to the wicked one.

649
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,842
Pray for thy brother.

650
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,005
- You must believe us!
- Evil wretches!

651
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,406
- Thomasin!
- [screams]

652
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,482
Pray.

653
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:44,124
[all] Our Father, which art in
Heaven, hallowed be thy name...

654
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,770
Jonas, pray.

655
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,771
I... I cannot remember my prayer.
[moans]

656
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,764
- What?
- Nor I. I cannot.

657
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,444
What nonsense is this?

658
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,682
Speak, children.

659
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,445
Our Father, which
art in Heaven...

660
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,369
- [cries]
- ...hallowed be thy name

661
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,370
[both crying]
Stop it! Stop it!

662
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,608
Pray, you beasts.
[cries]

663
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,250
- Get on thy knees and pray!
- [screams]

664
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,443
- Thomasin!
- [screams]

665
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,967
I don't hear this. This is not so.

666
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,328
[screams]

667
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,727
[gasps]

668
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,802
It's her!

669
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,769
A cat.

670
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,444
A crow.

671
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,481
A raven. A three-legged dog. A wolf!

672
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,166
[moans]
She desires of my blood.

673
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,810
She desires of my blood.

674
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,087
- Satan upon me!
- She desires of my blood!

675
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,891
[all the children
speaking over one another]

676
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,806
She sends 'em upon me.

677
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,521
My Lord, my Jesus!
Save me!

678
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,683
- Think on Christ!
- She sends her devils!

679
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,129
I am thine enemy, wallowing
in the blood of my sins!

680
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,322
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want

681
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,528
He maketh me to lie
in green pastures,

682
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,934
and leadeth me by the still water...

683
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,565
[Caleb] I am thine enemy...

684
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,809
[prayers overlap]

685
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,160
I am thine enemy,

686
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,368
wallowing on the blood
and filth of my sin!

687
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,450
- ...I will fear no evil
- [Caleb]: For thou art with me.

688
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,251
[panting]

689
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,846
Caleb... Caleb...

690
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,043
Cast a light of countenance
upon me.

691
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,522
Spread over me
the lap of Thy love.

692
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,729
Wash me in the everflowing
fountains of Thy blood.

693
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,362
Holy Thine I am,
my sweet Lord Jesus.

694
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:44,561
My Lord, my love, kiss me
with the kisses of Thy mouth.

695
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,402
How lovely art Thou.

696
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,602
Thy embrace!

697
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,001
My Lord!
[laughs]

698
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,560
My Lord!
My love!

699
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,007
My sole salvation!

700
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,923
Take me to Thy lap!

701
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,889
[laughs]

702
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,371
[gasps]

703
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,410
[moans of joy]

704
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,290
Caleb...

705
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,124
Caleb?

706
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,288
Caleb?

707
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,969
Caleb.

708
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,646
Caleb...

709
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:47,203
[sobs]
Wake up, please! Wake up!

710
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,850
Wake up, wake up.

711
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,685
[sobs]
Wake up.

712
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,126
[wailing]

713
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,767
He is dead!

714
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:07,209
[wailing]
He is dead!

715
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,204
[sobbing]

716
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,601
Jonas, Mercy, get up.

717
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,610
Get up!

718
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,047
Get away from him!
Get thee gone!

719
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,647
[sobbing]

720
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,406
Thomasin!

721
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,209
Thomasin. Thomasin...

722
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,520
My girl...

723
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,846
[weeping]

724
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,961
This tree will be
lovely come spring.

725
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,361
Do you remember
when we came hither?

726
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,681
Such a pretty tree.

727
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,126
Next year I'll just own us
a wheat field.

728
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,924
Start it at this tree
and end it thither.

729
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,446
We'd have been a proper farm then.

730
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,441
Brought us a big fat milk cow,
finished us the barn.

731
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,326
You must tell me, Thomasin.

732
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,729
Tomorrow I cannot keep secret of this.

733
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,406
The council will be called
and thy life is--

734
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,881
- Thy life--
- Will you not believe me?

735
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,884
I saw The Serpent in my son.
You stopped their prayer, Thom--

736
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,726
- They lie!
- I saw it.

737
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,849
Caleb disappeared with thee.

738
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,402
- I love Caleb.
- And who then found him,

739
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,090
pale as death,

740
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,289
naked as sin and witch'd?

741
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,641
Thomasin, listen to me.

742
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,882
The bargain that was made
is of no effect.

743
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,122
- I made no bargain.
- Thy soul belongeth to Christ.

744
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,891
- I made no bargain.
- The Devil hath no interest in thee.

745
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,521
- I am no witch, father.
- What did I but see in my house?

746
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,887
- Will you not hear me?
- Prithee, confess.

747
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,843
Why have you turned against me?

748
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,169
Christ can un-witch us
if you will but speak truth to me.

749
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,881
As I love thee, speak truth.

750
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,851
- You ask me to speak truth?
- I beg thee.

751
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,049
You and Mother planned
to rid the farm of me.

752
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,442
Aye, I heard you speak of it.

753
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,522
Is that truth?

754
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,844
You took of Mother's cup
and let her rail at me.

755
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,321
You confessed not
till it was too late.

756
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,402
- Is that truth?
- Peace thee.

757
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,766
- I will not.
- I am thy father.

758
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:59,003
- You are a hypocrite!
- Hold thy tongue, daughter mine.

759
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,890
You took Caleb to the wood and let me
take the blame of that too.

760
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,689
Is that truth?

761
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,044
You let Mother be as thy master.

762
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,851
You cannot bring the crops to yield!
You cannot hunt!

763
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,649
- Is that truth enough?
- Enough.

764
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,768
Thou canst do nothing
save cut wood!

765
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,080
Bitch!

766
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,481
[screams]
And you will not hear me!

767
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,449
[sobbing]

768
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,330
Must I hear the Devil
wag his tongue in thy mouth?

769
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,209
[sobs]

770
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,129
Ask the twins then!

771
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,004
Go on, ask them!

772
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,526
They spend all day long
babbling to that horned beast.

773
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,840
They know well his voice.

774
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,251
Go to.

775
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,688
The Adversary oft comes
in the shape of a he-goat.

776
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,644
And whispers.
Aye, whispers!

777
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,482
He is Lucifer.
You know it.

778
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,801
- The twins know it too.
- Slander thy brethren no more.

779
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,010
- It is they!
- From my sight!

780
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,082
T'was they and that goat
what bewitched this whole farm.

781
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,400
Lies.

782
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,251
Was't a wolf stole Sam?

783
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,051
I never saw no wolf.

784
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,929
Mercy told me herself
by the stream,

785
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,480
"I be the Witch of the Wood."

786
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,244
Get up. Rise!

787
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,606
[screams]

788
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,444

[gasp]

793
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,088
- What is this?
- [William] Speak.

794
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,003
I am no witch.

795
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,048
Get her from me sight!
I'll not have her in this house!

796
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,884
[William]
She is no witch, Katherine.

797
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,611
What is the cause, daughter?
Tell thy Mother!

798
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,045
I cannot know for certain.

799
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,849
[William]
Thou toldst me well thou knew.

800
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,410
[Katherine]
I cannot look at her.

801
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,121
[William] Aye, but ye shall.
Thomasin. Thomasin!

802
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:02,008
Jonas and Mercy.

803
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,970
They make covenant with the Devil
in the shape of Black Phillip.

804
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,408
[William]
Dost hear that, ye black minions?

805
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,121
Dost hear that, you devils?

806
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,808
Wake! Wake from this!

807
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,844
Did ye makes some
unholy bond with that goat?

808
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,810
Speak, if this be pretense.

[William laughs]

810
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:38,568
Dissemblers!
Grave pretenders all.

811
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,483
Hear me this:

812
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,564
I will not play a fool
to children's games!

813
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,722
This is no sport, William.

814
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:49,168
Yet these lies from our babes' mouths
are but trifles to them.

815
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,164
- I do not lie.
- Silence, creature!

816
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,211
Thy son is dead, damned!

817
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,203

- The Devil!

Thou know it not.

819
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,246
- The Devil will speak scripture too!
- Thou know it not.

820
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,163
- Tis not true!
- We are damned!

821
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,685
Wake!

822
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,969
Fetch the billhook, wife,

823
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,089
and I will smite Jonas as Abraham
would have done his seed.

824
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,446
No, stop it! Stop it!

825
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,524
Fetch the billhook
and I will dash his skull!

[Katherine sobs]

Please, father.
No, it's not safe. Not with them!

831
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,321
Keep me from this goat.

832
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,323
If that old billy be the Devil,
I'd have danced with him myself.

833
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,847
I'll break thee out upon the dawn
and we'll set back to the plantation.

834
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,843
Think on thy sins.

Does father think I am?

Are you?

840
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,405
No.

Oh, my God.

My own fault.

851
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:20,771
I am infected with the filth of pride.

852
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,761
I know it.

853
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,444
I am.

854
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:31,806
Dispose of me how Thou will't...

855
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,410
...yet redeem my children.

856

...and Thine enemy.
