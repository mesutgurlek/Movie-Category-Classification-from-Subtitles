(MAN) There are many villages
not yet ravaged by the pestilence.

175
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,457
There's a village in the north
that burnt 128 witches in one night.

176
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,624
That's 16 an hour for 8 hours.

177
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:21,999
When the night was through,
they'd killed every woman in the village.

178
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:26,040
By the end of that week,
the men were shagging pigs.

185
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:51,915
Where does the Church
believe this pestilence has come from?

186
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:55,540
I don't believe God
is punishing us, like many do.

187
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:59,665
I say from France,
where all foul things emerge.

188

(WOLFSTAN) For once, Swire,
you might not be too far from the truth.

189
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:09,249
Three summers past we fought
a battle at Crecy in Normandy.

190
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,374
King Edward's Army was dwarfed.

191
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:16,207
For every 20 of us
there were 100 Frenchmen at least.

192
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,665
And the French, oh, the French...

193
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:24,249
They could sense victory.
They could smell it.

194
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:29,124
But on that day, for the first time,
our archers used the longbow.

195
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:33,040
Quicker to load, further in flight.

196
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:37,249
Their arrows were useless.
They couldn't reach us.

197
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:41,624
But ours...
ours were like a dark buzzing cloud.

198
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:48,207
At the day's end, the field was littered
with their dead and dying.

199
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:53,707
Custom, no matter how fierce the battle,
is to use the misericorde.

200
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,457
(DALYWAG)
Misericorde is the 'mercy giver'.

201
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,957
You stab through the armpit, directly
into the heart - quick and painless.

202
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,249
(WOLFSTAN) But on this day,
there was an end to chivalry.

203
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:08,457
King Edward
ordered every Frenchman left alive

204
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,915
to be killed without mercy.

205
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,540
Arms, heads, legs...

206
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:17,582
hacked away.

207
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:23,290
God's greatest army
descended into savagery.

208
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:30,832
Forgive me, but how does
that concern the pestilence?

209
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,582
(WOLFSTAN) We invited Death
among us that day.

210

He hasn't left us since.

211
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,124
That woman you killed...
she was no witch.

212
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,290
Why did you volunteer to join us, Monk?

213
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,249
To serve God.

214
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:25,415
Killing witches serves God.

215
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,707
The woman was already dead.

216
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,540
Had I freed her, the mob would have
caught her again and burned her.

217

And real.

645
01:26:13,458 --> 01:26:17,040
This... is real.

646
01:26:25,416 --> 01:26:26,999
(HOB GASPS)

647
01:26:27,166 --> 01:26:30,999
There... is... no... God.

648
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,415
Where are you?

649
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:54,124
Where are you?

650
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,415
(LANGIVA) "Thou shall not kill",
remember?

651
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:06,207
- Remember?
- Averill was in purgatory.

652
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:08,874
(LANGIVA) Perhaps in your twisted mind.

653
01:27:09,041 --> 01:27:12,249
Did you never think
that maybe Averill was never dead?

654
01:27:15,125 --> 01:27:18,832
We found her in the forest.
Injured but very much alive.

655
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,124
No, that's not true.

656
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:25,457
Yes, Osmund, Averill was never dead.
She was alive!

657
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:28,374
I drugged her.

658
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:32,540
- I drugged her.
- No.

659
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:48,415
Why... would you do that?
Why would you bury her?

660
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:51,040
Because people need miracles.

661
01:27:51,208 --> 01:27:55,457
And they worship the miracle-makers
whoever they might be.

662
01:27:59,833 --> 01:28:02,749
The people in this village
believed in me.

663
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:04,499
And so did you.

664
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:06,832
NO! AVERILL WAS DEAD!

665
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,124
You killed her.

666
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:13,290
Averill was dead...

667
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,415
Averill was...

668
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:22,915
.. she was dead.

669
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:30,915
Bring her back!

670
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:36,040
I beg you, bring her back.

671
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:39,790
No. I can't.

672
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:42,290
Pray to your God.

673
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:45,207
See what He can do.

674
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:53,082
Averill was...

675
01:28:54,208 --> 01:28:56,207
.. she was dead...

676
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:25,082
(WOLFSTAN) There's nothing
beautiful or uplifting

677
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:27,582
in returning people to God.

678
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:33,249
There's no place
in Heaven for those who kill.

679
01:29:35,958 --> 01:29:39,999
The pestilence
claimed no higher purpose

680
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:43,415
and those who had survived
our swords that day

681
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:46,249
soon fell foul of its scythe.

682
01:29:47,833 --> 01:29:51,207
They were not protected by the witch.

683
01:29:51,416 --> 01:29:53,915
They were simply remote.

684
01:29:54,083 --> 01:29:57,290
And once the pestilence
crossed their marsh

685
01:29:57,458 --> 01:30:00,582
it killed them too.

686
01:30:02,708 --> 01:30:04,874
(HORSES APPROACHING)

687
01:30:10,541 --> 01:30:13,374
Whoa. Whoa.

688
01:30:20,875 --> 01:30:22,874
Osmund...

689
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:25,040
Osmund...

690
01:30:27,958 --> 01:30:30,082
We're here.

691
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:45,707
Osmund.

692
01:30:48,916 --> 01:30:51,999
That you've returned safe is a miracle.

693
01:30:54,125 --> 01:30:55,790
Who is that?

694
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,499
The necromancer
I'm delivering to the Bishop.

695
01:31:00,916 --> 01:31:03,999
Here. That's it.

696
01:31:13,083 --> 01:31:16,165
- How many of you are left?
- Enough.

697
01:31:18,791 --> 01:31:20,832
Look after him.

698
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,082
There's no need.

699
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:26,374
He's back with God.

700
01:31:48,041 --> 01:31:50,332
(WOLFSTAN) I never saw him again

701
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:53,540
but I heard stories...

702
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:56,290
Dark stories...

703
01:31:56,458 --> 01:31:59,665
that in the years that followed

704
01:31:59,833 --> 01:32:02,832
Osmund's heart turned cold.

705
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,249
That in the shadow of his grief
he found hate.

706
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:09,082
And that in God's name

707
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:13,999
he took up the sword
and vengeance became his creed.

708
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:23,374
Can I help you?

709
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:33,707
Please...

710
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:43,499
Please... Please...

711
01:32:47,125 --> 01:32:49,165
I've done nothing wrong.

712
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:52,332
Please...

713
01:32:57,458 --> 01:33:00,290
You have the wrong woman...

714
01:33:02,708 --> 01:33:05,332
I want a confession
and I want her alive.

715
01:33:13,708 --> 01:33:15,999
(WOMAN SOBS)

716
01:33:30,791 --> 01:33:32,749
Please.

717
01:33:36,708 --> 01:33:38,624
- (CRUNCH)
- (WOMAN SCREAMS)

718
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:53,165
Osmund, she won't confess.

719
01:33:53,333 --> 01:33:55,540
Are you sure she's a witch?

720
01:34:02,041 --> 01:34:04,499
Where is she?

721
01:34:11,708 --> 01:34:16,957
(WOLFSTAN) Some say he found the witch
and that he tortured her and burned her.

722
01:34:21,375 --> 01:34:23,749
Others say it was never her.

723
01:34:26,708 --> 01:34:31,749
It was only her guilt he saw,
in the eyes of the accused.

724
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:51,999
(SHE SCREAMS)

725
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:59,832
I like to think that he found peace.

726
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:04,165
That he continued
seeing beauty in the world...

727
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:07,790
.. goodness.
