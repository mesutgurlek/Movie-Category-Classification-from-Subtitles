Why not? Something Hirschhorn got him.

- Solomon Islands.

83

- (laughs): Solomon Islands.
- Yeah.

84
00:02:52,424 --> 00:02:54,424
- Wow.
- No, it took me a year

85
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:56,628

gonna have to start over.

No. No, I understand, Dr. Daudier,

93

to decimate your budget.

on the retrieval of a meteor.

98

Shut that off!

99
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:28,516
Is there any way we can get
an additional $40 million?

100
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,541
No. No, I might be able to get you five,

101
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:32,455

to personally sign off

Constituent casework.

162
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:30,271
There are eight constituents

163
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:31,820
who want a meeting with the senator.

164
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:33,889
You will investigate their complaints...

165
00:06:33,914 --> 00:06:35,603
this is your brother's office...

166
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,433
and then you'll do what you can
to satisfy their complaints.

167
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:39,643
This...

168
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,211
is where you'll be meeting them.

169
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,196
And then you'll give them these
pens, caps and signed photos.

170
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:48,338
It's all about getting them
to vote next election,

171
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:50,190
so just keep them happy.

172
00:06:50,215 --> 00:06:52,206
I'll be right down the hall
if you need anything. Good luck.

173
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:03,687
Hi. I'm Laurel.

174
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:05,797
You're all meeting with me today.

175
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:07,804
I guess.

176
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:10,211
It's my first day, so, you know...

177
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:12,634
go easy on me. (chuckles)

178
00:07:18,055 --> 00:07:20,134
(clears throat softly)

179
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:23,378
It says here you're having Social
Security problems, Claire?

180
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:25,862
<i>I</i> don't have Social Security problems.

181
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:28,424
<i>You</i> have Social Security problems.

182
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,754
Right. And how may I help you with...

183
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:34,900
<i>my...</i> Social Security problems?

184
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,486
It's a rash, it's not
a preexisting condition.

185
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:40,674
And the Medicare doctor was so rude.

186
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:41,775
He said, uh,

187
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,741
"That's just a rash."

188
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:45,733
(chuckles): Huh! A rash!

189
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:47,718
- I really want to give it to the senator.
- Yes.

190
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:50,317
It's just, the senator's
a bit busy, so...

191
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:52,716
Why are you trying to keep me from him?

192
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,754
Yes, yes. Hi. She's having
Social Security problems.

Why can't you help me? (laughs)

195
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:02,424
No, no, please don't...

196
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:03,810

This is Senator Healy.
What is your name, dear?

Yeah, well, listen, Joan,

I need you to get your ass in gear

or I'm personally cutting

00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:55,262
Do you understand?

221
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:56,287
Good.

222
00:08:57,012 --> 00:08:59,302
You know, don't be afraid
to use my power.

223
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:05,431
Mmm.

224
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:11,255
Ms. Burke.

225
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:13,255
Looks like it's just us now.

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,647
He's not?

230
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:25,954
His manners, his speech, his drinking...

231
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:27,736
- He needs a drug and alcohol program?
- No.

232
00:09:28,006 --> 00:09:29,755
He used to drink a lot.

233
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,236
And now he doesn't.

234
00:09:32,213 --> 00:09:33,318
At all.

235
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:35,541
Okay.

236
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,112
I guess I'm-I'm not really
sure how I can help.

237
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:42,437
He works as an engineer
on a container ship, <i>The Alba.</i>

238
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:44,895
He just got back from a crossing, and...

239
00:09:45,716 --> 00:09:47,005
I found this.

RANDALL: <i>Take the camera. Come on.</i>

246
00:10:06,838 --> 00:10:07,950
MAN: <i>Randall...</i>

<i>Watch your step.</i>

250
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:19,701
Oh, my gosh, something got out, man.

251
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:23,687
- What's in there?
- I don't know.

252
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:26,021
It looks like a big rock.

254
00:10:27,013 --> 00:10:28,005

- What's that?

00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,452
- Oh, man!
- Check it out.

256

00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:37,477
Randall...

261
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:38,817
(Randall screams)

262
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:42,901
Something happened
to Randall on that ship,

263
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:45,325
something that was in that container,

264
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,317
and I need your help finding out what.

265
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:49,762
MAN: Laurel Healy?

266
00:10:49,787 --> 00:10:51,138
Do you have a minute?

267
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:55,215
No. No. Um, could you just fill
out a form in the waiting room,

268
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,231
- and I'll be right with you?
- Oh, no, actually,

269
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:57,455
- I don't have time.
- Sir...

270
00:10:57,938 --> 00:10:59,481
I'm with someone right now.

271
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,387
Okay.

272
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,143
I'm sorry, Ms. Burke.

273
00:11:03,168 --> 00:11:05,077
Have you gone to the police or a doctor?

274
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:06,671
No. I came here first.

275
00:11:06,696 --> 00:11:08,135
Why here?

276
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,346
The crate is yours.

277
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:11,032
I called the navy shipyard.

278
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:13,052
Your office signed off on its delivery.

279
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:15,036
Our office? What was in it?

What do you need?

290
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:38,667
Is there any reason
we would have signed off

291
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:40,573
on a crate being shipped from Russia?

292
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:41,696
Excuse me?

293
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:44,839
But, please, if you ever
need someone to speak to you,

294
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:45,933
don't hesitate to call us.

295
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,326
Nothing. Nothing. I'll handle it.

296
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:52,696
LAUREL: So, you're having problems
with your Viagra prescription, sir?

297
00:11:52,697 --> 00:11:53,867
- (laughs): No.
- Says here,

298
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:56,374
"Viagra not covered
by Medicaid," Mr. Flannigan.

299
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,391
I'm not Mr. Flannigan.
I'm Gareth Ritter,

300
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,327
Legislative Director

301
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:04,158
Red Wheatus?

302
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:07,386
- He's the Republican senator from Maryland?
- Yes. Yes, I know.

303
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:11,740
I mean, I don't...
I don't know, but, um...

304
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:13,638
Would-would you like me to get
a more senior staff person?

305
00:12:13,663 --> 00:12:14,601
No, I don't need senior.

306
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:16,491
I need the sister.
I'm here to offer a deal

307
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:17,476
on behalf of Senator Wheatus.

308
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:18,952
Actually, I'm not here at all.

309
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:20,278
- You're not?
- No.

310
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,942
And if your brother tries
to use this, if he tries

311
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,832
to get mileage out of this
by embarrassing the Republicans,

312
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:25,581
- we'll deny this meeting ever happened.
- Okay, I think I should get somebody.

313
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:28,277
Ms. Healy, there are now 90 minutes
until the government shuts down.

314
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:29,792
My boss is ready to cross the aisle

315
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,127
and vote with the Democrats.

316
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:34,626
All he needs is a $48 million
earmark for autism studies.

317
00:12:34,651 --> 00:12:35,646
It's a pet cause of his.

318
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:38,436
- Okay, seriously, this is my first day...
- I'm out the door.

319
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:40,026
This is my cell.

320
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,595
Get your brother's agreement
in 90 minutes and call me,

321
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,300
or my boss will be forced to stand
with his Republican colleagues.

322
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:47,400
And if anybody finds out
about this, the deal goes away.

323
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:48,646
Do you understand?

324
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:50,885
No.

325
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,088
Ms. Healy, 100,000
government jobs depend

326
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:55,845
on you getting to your brother
in the next 90 minutes

327
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,259
and convincing him to take this deal,

328
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:58,775
so if I were you...

329
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:01,201
I'd run.

330
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,420
(door opens)

331
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:07,841
(door closes)

332
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,676
Luke, you've just been offered a deal

333
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:14,270
by a Republican senator on the budget.

334
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,914
- We have 90 minutes.
- (phone beeps)

335
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:18,082
Yes, hello. It's me.

336
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:22,456
Oh, Dad. Yeah. Yeah, I'm just busy.

337
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:24,137
Yes. I'm just checking in to see

338
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:26,010
how things are going on your first day.

339
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:28,074
It's good. It's good.
Couldn't be better.

340
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,534
Dad, can I call you back?

341
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:31,149
- Why? Is something going on?
- No.

342
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:33,260
Just... I'm gonna call you back.

343
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:35,285
(phone beeps off, sighs)

344
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,710
No running in the Capitol, ma'am.

345
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,049
No fast-walking, either.

346
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:50,480
Laurel? Laurel Healy?

347
00:13:51,237 --> 00:13:53,386
Senator Spitz. I saw
you at your dad's party.

348
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:56,111
Oh, yes, hi. Um, is Luke
on the senate floor?

349
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,274
No, he left for dinner ten minutes ago.

350
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:00,032
Are you all right?
You seem out of breath.

351
00:14:00,057 --> 00:14:01,936
No. I mean, yes. I...

352
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:04,130
I need to know where he went.
Do you know?

353
00:14:04,155 --> 00:14:07,605
Yes, he was here a few minutes
ago, but then he left.

354
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:09,684
Okay, I have 40 minutes
to get in touch with him.

355
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:12,122
Do you know where he went?
Please. I'm his sister.

356
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:14,333
Oh, here's my driver's license.

357
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:16,651
I had pink hair back then.
I wanted to be a poet.

358
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:18,793
I don't know where he went,
but I don't think it was work.

359
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:20,058
He was with a woman.

360
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,189
- Germaine. Thank you.
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

361
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,610
No, a red-headed woman.

362
00:14:29,723 --> 00:14:31,472
(shouting): Scarlett?

363
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,825
It's Laurel.

364
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:35,825
The office said you were home.

365
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,049
(sighs)

366
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:40,246
Luke, I know you're in there.

367
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:41,636
(gasps)

368
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:44,584

369
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:45,728
Crap.

370
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:48,573
- (loud, overlapping chatter over phone)
- Senators, gentlemen, wait.

371
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,372
Do we make the deal?

372
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:53,455
That's all we need to answer,
and we only have...

373
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:54,596
Nine minutes to decide.

374
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:56,317
MAN: <i>Look, the Republicans are scared.</i>

375
00:14:56,342 --> 00:14:58,059
I say we use this to embarrass them.

376
00:14:58,084 --> 00:15:00,082
LAUREL: No, no, he said if you
did that, he would deny it.

377
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,370
<i>Who's "he"? And who is talking?</i>

378
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:05,082
- It's my sister.
- SPITZ: <i>I say we take the deal.</i>

379
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,475
All Red wants is $48 million
in earmarks.

380
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,171
LUKE: <i>Or we collect on their
media hit, then make the deal.</i>

381
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:11,703
<i>Let the Republicans shut down
the government.</i>

382
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:13,756
It's bad for them, bad for
their presidential candidate.

383
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:16,000
Why would we get in the way of them
shooting themselves in the foot?

384
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:18,963
Because it's 100,000 people out of work.

385
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:24,833
LUKE: I apologize. Any other opinions?

386
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,126
They're gonna let it close.

387
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:30,962
It's the smart move.

388
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,407
God, I hate politics.

389
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:36,359
I'm a child of divorce.

390
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:42,427
This isn't serious with your brother.

391
00:15:42,452 --> 00:15:43,626
It's just...

392
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,266
blowing off steam.

393
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,299
Okay.

394
00:15:46,324 --> 00:15:47,612
(door opens)

395
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:48,902
LUKE: Okay.

(clears his throat)

397
00:15:50,102 --> 00:15:51,500
So we're gonna let the deadline pass.

398
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:53,804
Luke, this is wrong.
It's just $48 million.

399
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,896
Yes, and we're looking to the long game.

400
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,212
It's about who'll be the next president,

401
00:15:57,213 --> 00:15:58,962
who'll choose the next
Supreme Court justice.

402
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:00,784
Ow! What's that about?

403
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:02,057
Cheating on Germaine.

404
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:05,120
It-It's, it-it's not cheating.
Well, it's not what you think. Ow!

405
00:16:05,145 --> 00:16:07,449
- Stop it! Ow!
- I will as soon as you do.

406
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:08,558
Are you kidding me?

407
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,042
- She's eight months pregnant.
- Look, it was a mistake.

408
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:14,578
Okay? Now, I need to go
upstairs to change.

409
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:16,292
Are you all right with that,
or do you want to hit me again?

410
00:16:16,293 --> 00:16:18,916
Oh, I do, but I won't.

411
00:16:19,698 --> 00:16:20,994

Hi. It's Laurel. Healy.

416
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:36,268
- So...
- You're passing?

417
00:16:37,477 --> 00:16:39,000
They just...

418
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:42,547
don't want to make a deal... just yet.

00:20:17,004 --> 00:20:18,599
Don't you want to know
who the crew member was?

477
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:19,998
What?

478
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:22,639
I mean, it just seems like a
natural reaction to my question.

479
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:24,769
"Which crew member
are we talking about?"

480
00:20:25,818 --> 00:20:27,334
I'm a little busy right now.

481
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:29,849
Is there anything else you need?

482
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,292
Yes, the cargo manifest.

483
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,370
Why do you need the cargo manifest?

484
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:35,690
I just need to check
on something for my boss.

485
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,519
You know Randall Burke?

486
00:20:42,628 --> 00:20:44,206
No, who's that?

487
00:20:44,613 --> 00:20:45,689
Randall Burke.

488
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,722
You were... you were
seen in a video with him,

489
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,519
below deck, opening a container.

490
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,649
I have no idea what
you're talking about, ma'am.

Okay, I just need the manifest.

495
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:08,466
I wish you congressional aides
would talk to each other.

496
00:21:08,491 --> 00:21:10,559
I gave it out to another guy this morning.

497
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,924
- Who?
- Someone named Gareth?

498
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:16,460
Gareth?

499
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,623
TRUMP (on TV): <i>I turned down
so much money. I feel so foolish.</i>

500
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:30,090
<i>I feel so... You know, my whole
life, I take, right? Greedy.</i>

501
00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:32,139
<i>I take. I take. Greedy! Greedy!</i>

502
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:34,373
<i>The government shutdown, widely blamed</i>

503
00:21:34,374 --> 00:21:36,114
- <i>on the Democrats in Congress,</i>
- (sighs)

00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:38,993
<i>continues to devastate
the local economy.</i>

505
00:21:39,523 --> 00:21:40,530
<i>Angry workers took...</i>

506
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:41,921
Hello?

507
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,994
(loud snoring)

508
00:21:47,414 --> 00:21:50,333
(loud snoring)

509
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:53,448
Hey. You the masseuse?

510
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:55,525
The what?

511
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:56,913
The masseuse.

512
00:21:57,452 --> 00:21:58,911
It's, uh...

513
00:21:58,936 --> 00:22:00,122
(laughs)

514
00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:02,147
It's my adductors.

515
00:22:02,874 --> 00:22:06,124
They... they need special attention.

516
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:08,833
No.

517
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:10,083
(snores)

518
00:22:10,084 --> 00:22:11,623
(phone rings)

519
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:13,992
GARETH: Senator Wheatus' office.

520
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:17,313
I'm sorry, the senator's out
to lunch right now.

521
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:19,784
Can I please take a message?

522
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:22,678
Look, I'm not here about the...

523
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:23,899
stuff yesterday.

524
00:22:23,931 --> 00:22:25,829
You have the ship manifest
for Ms. Bur...

525
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:28,350
The stuff yesterday?

526
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:29,873
You mean the 20 Hill staffers

527
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:31,117
that I sent home unemployed in tears?

528
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,388
Come on.

529
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:36,101
The Republicans are just as much
to blame as the Democrats.

530
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:38,796
And why are you helping
Ms. Burke anyway?

531
00:22:38,828 --> 00:22:40,387
She's our constituent.

532
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:43,862
I saw you in our waiting room,
trying to poach her.

533
00:22:43,887 --> 00:22:46,104
Poaching, seriously?
She only asked for my help

534
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:47,692
because she knew you couldn't handle it.

535
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:50,180
And would you stop following me?

536
00:22:50,181 --> 00:22:53,050
I look like I'm collaborating
with the Democrats.

537
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:55,510
Oh, Gareth, about that pro-choice rally,

538
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:57,511
what are you wearing?

539
00:23:01,362 --> 00:23:03,031
Scientific research materials?

540
00:23:03,056 --> 00:23:04,390
Yeah, for the Smithsonian.

541
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:05,890
Okayed by your brother's office.

542
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:07,310
Did you try the Smithsonian?

543
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:09,181
It was closed, due to
the government shutdown.

544
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:11,876
Did you question the first mate?

545
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:13,866
Yeah. Chuck Sanders.

546
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:16,510
"Everybody comes back a little
changed after four weeks at sea.

547
00:23:16,535 --> 00:23:18,765
"Sometimes it takes your family
a while to adapt to you

548
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,525
and you to adapt to them."

549
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:22,390
That's what the captain said.

550
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:24,050
So?

551
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:26,492
No, that's word for word
what the captain said.

552
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:30,280
They agreed on a story.
Why agree on a story

553
00:23:30,305 --> 00:23:31,797
unless there's a reason
to agree on a story?

554
00:23:31,822 --> 00:23:34,065
Look. It's your second day, right?

555
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:36,540
There are plenty of reasons
to be paranoid in this town,

556
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:37,600
you don't need to create new ones.

557
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:40,106
Oh, please tell me more about this town.

558
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:42,606
I'm eating lunch, so you can go.

559
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:48,720
The senator may still be
interested in a deal.

560
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:52,260
On the budget. You can get this
town back to work tomorrow.

561
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:54,890
All you have to do is get
your brother to say yes.

562
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,220
- I'll talk to him.
- Don't talk to him.

563
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,051
Convince him.

564
00:24:00,431 --> 00:24:02,708
- Why do I trust him?
- Why not trust him?

565
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:05,638
Senator Wheatus? He doesn't
give a damn about $48 million

566
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:08,390
for autism. He only lives
to drink and screw.

567
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:10,271
Now, his legislative director,
Gareth Ritter,

568
00:24:10,296 --> 00:24:12,411
on the other hand,
has a sister who is autistic.

569
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,589
How do you know that?

570
00:24:14,614 --> 00:24:16,180
(clears throat) I had Scarlett check.

571
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:18,298
- Oh, really, Scarlett? How's she doing?
- Oh, don't, don't.

572
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,720
Look, I already broke it off with her.

573
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:20,948
You broke it off like Dad broke it off

574
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:22,424
- with his secretary?
- Oh, Dad?

575
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:24,703
- No, this is not comparable, Laurel.
- You almost killed him

576
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:25,804
when you found out.

577
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:28,373
- I left home when I found out.
- Uh, do we really got to talk about

578
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:29,459
the whole boss-employee

579
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:30,475
- dynamic here? Because...
- Okay, fine, yes.

580
00:24:30,476 --> 00:24:32,851
Just remind me when I can be
a sister again, Senator.

581
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,776
Look, make sure this Gareth guy
isn't freelancing,

582
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:39,890
and I'll consider the deal.

583
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:41,140
- Good.
- All right.

584
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:42,674
What about this?

585
00:24:44,261 --> 00:24:46,352
Well, it's for a Dr. Daudier
at the Smithsonian.

586
00:24:46,377 --> 00:24:49,047
I said I needed to sign off on his
Russian expenditures piecemeal.

587
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:50,312
And, hey, don't get obsessed

588
00:24:50,337 --> 00:24:52,050
with any one constituent, okay?
You've got to keep

589
00:24:52,051 --> 00:24:54,681
a lot of constituents happy.
Are you listening to me?

590
00:24:55,721 --> 00:24:57,350
Have you noticed something weird?

591
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:58,794
What?

592
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:00,470
People are staring at us.

593
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:02,198
Hmm? Who?

594
00:25:02,891 --> 00:25:05,051
Those four people over there.

595
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:09,640
That waiter...

596
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,641
over there.

597
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:14,187
So?

598
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:16,260
We're famous.

599
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:19,390
It's like Hollywood
but with uglier people.

600
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:20,820
Get used to it.

601
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:26,260
(line ringing)

602
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:27,930
BURKE: <i>Hello.</i>

603
00:25:27,931 --> 00:25:30,627
Hi, this is Laurel
from Senator Healy's office.

604
00:25:30,652 --> 00:25:32,245
Oh. Hi.

605
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,058
<i>As part of my casework, I just
wanted to update you, Ms. Burke.</i>

606
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,778
The crate... from your husband's ship...

607
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:39,350
I-I was able to trace it back
to the Smithsonian.

608
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:41,810
<i>A man named Dr. Daudier...
our office signed off</i>

609
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:43,969
<i>- on his deliveries from Russia.</i>
- Who's that, dear?

610
00:25:45,181 --> 00:25:46,446
No one.

611
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:48,360
Just Judy from class.

612
00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:51,600
Judy, why don't we talk tomorrow?

613
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,236
Is that your husband?
Is everything okay?

614
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,470
<i>Yes, thank you. That sounds good.</i>

615
00:25:56,819 --> 00:25:58,458
(beep)

616
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,974
Did you see what the Republicans said?

617
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:02,824
No.

618
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:04,052
They're insane.

619
00:26:04,077 --> 00:26:05,826
What is this world coming to?

620
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:07,105
We need to do something.

621
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:19,976
I'm sorry I haven't been myself.

622
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,285
I think I've been feeling a bit angry.

623
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:24,886
About the world.

624
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:31,152
That's nice. Good night.

625
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:34,836
(chuckles)

626
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:36,861
Randall, I need to get some sleep.

627
00:26:41,221 --> 00:26:43,076
Randall, you need to let me go.

628
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:03,970
I... I said let me go!

629
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,140
Shh, shh, shh. Shh.

630
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:08,136
It's okay, it's okay.

631
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:09,831
Don't struggle, or they'll hurt you.

632
00:27:09,856 --> 00:27:11,107
You're still gonna be yourself,

633
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:12,513
but a better part of yourself.

634
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:14,794
And we're gonna know each other
like never before.

635
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:17,435
I love you.

636
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:29,002
- Are you asking me if I'm freelancing?
- Yes.

637
00:27:29,034 --> 00:27:31,498
We're in the middle of the biggest
budget crisis in four years

638
00:27:31,523 --> 00:27:34,072
and you think that I would make up
a budget offer from my boss?

639
00:27:34,097 --> 00:27:35,439
Yes.

640
00:27:35,464 --> 00:27:37,736
Senator Wheatus doesn't give
a damn about autistic kids.

641
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:39,984
You do. You have an autistic sister.

642
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:42,764
So, you've been investigating me?

643
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:45,644
I always find that best
when I don't trust someone.

644
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:48,203
- Okay, I'm gonna be completely honest.
- How refreshing.

645
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,036
I told my boss that
the Democrats wanted a deal

646
00:27:50,061 --> 00:27:52,661
and they were offering
$48 million for autism to close it.

647
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:54,247
And he said yes,

648
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,084
because I knew he wanted to take a deal.

649
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,897
He just didn't want to be
the first person to offer it.

650
00:27:57,922 --> 00:28:00,031
- So you're lying?
- I'm deal-making.

651
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:01,601
(scoffs)

652
00:28:01,602 --> 00:28:03,506
Oh, come on, are you seriously
walking away from this?

653
00:28:03,531 --> 00:28:05,065
People are going hungry over this.

654
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,482
People can't pay their rent,

655
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:09,856
and all you have to do is
convince your brother to meet.

656
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:11,168
That's all.

657
00:28:18,683 --> 00:28:20,846
- He's not freelancing.
- Who?

658
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:22,191
Gareth Ritter. He's not lying.

659
00:28:22,216 --> 00:28:23,373
Senator Wheatus wants a deal.

660
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:25,076
You want me to set up
a meeting with you two?

661
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:28,139
Let me think about it.

662
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:30,996
Luke, you need to do this.

663
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:32,449
- People are hurting.
- (phone buzzes)

664
00:28:32,474 --> 00:28:33,888
People always hurt.

665
00:28:34,977 --> 00:28:36,000
Yeah.

666
00:28:36,484 --> 00:28:38,094
So, then, what time's the interview?

667
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,119
(continues indistinctly)

668
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:46,907
Laurel, how are you?

669
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:48,704
Good, Dad. Can you do me a favor?

670
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:49,917
Sure. What do you need?

671
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:51,658
Don't tell Luke I told you this, but

672
00:28:51,683 --> 00:28:53,488
I think he has a chance
to make a deal on the budget

673
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:55,368
with a Republican senator,
and he's hesitating.

674
00:28:56,098 --> 00:28:57,166
Why?

675
00:28:57,191 --> 00:28:58,191
I don't know why.

676
00:28:58,216 --> 00:29:00,618
But I think you need to convince
him it's good for his career.

677
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:02,828
If he single-handedly puts
the government back to work,

678
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:04,788
he'll be the leader of the party.

679
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:06,321
Why don't you tell him that?

680
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:08,515
I'm his little sister.
He's not gonna listen to me,

681
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,219
he's gonna listen to you.

682
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:14,328
You may hate politics, Laurel,

683
00:29:14,329 --> 00:29:15,926
but you're not bad at it.

684
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:17,200
(door opens)

685
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:18,708
What?

686
00:29:18,709 --> 00:29:20,288
You did well.

687
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:22,078
(door opens)

688
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,708
This must be her.

689
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:26,165
Laurel, thank you so much
for helping Breanna.

690
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,486
They were just telling me
what a great job you did.

691
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:31,562
Yes, I get a little worried
about Randall being away.

692
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:33,658
Maybe even a little paranoid.

693
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,248
And Laurel was so great
at just hand-holding me.

694
00:29:36,412 --> 00:29:37,912
But now everything is great.

695
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:41,998
Everybody comes back
a little changed from the sea.

696
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:43,748
- You're out there for four weeks.
- Four weeks.

697
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,430
- Sometimes it takes your family
- Sometimes it takes your family

698
00:29:45,455 --> 00:29:47,313
- a while to adapt to you and
- a while to adapt to you and

699
00:29:47,338 --> 00:29:49,025
- you a while to adapt to them.
- you a while to adapt to them.

700
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:54,209
Uh, you know,
they want to give me $2,600

701
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:55,394
for my reelection campaign.

702
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,006
- Isn't that great?
- Anything to stop

703
00:29:57,031 --> 00:29:59,079
those Republicans
from ruining our country.

704
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:02,829
Breanna, do you have a minute?

705
00:30:08,354 --> 00:30:09,626
Is he hurting you?

706
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:11,537
What? No, we're good.

707
00:30:11,562 --> 00:30:13,623
Breanna, if there's some abuse
going on, all you have to do...

708
00:30:13,648 --> 00:30:15,562
Laurel. I'm happy.

709
00:30:16,257 --> 00:30:18,468
Don't question happiness.

710
00:30:19,335 --> 00:30:21,257
- Ready to go, babe?
- Mm.

711
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:26,828
You know why he brought her here?

712
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:28,348
To give to my campaign?

713
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:30,153
He wants to stop me from investigating.

714
00:30:31,044 --> 00:30:33,289
Laurel, this is constituent
care, not Nancy Drew.

715
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:34,641
They're happy. Take yes for an answer.

716
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,734
Senator. Your father's on the line.

717
00:30:36,914 --> 00:30:38,333
(clears throat)

718
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:39,608
Wonder what he wants.

719
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,978
- You must be Gareth Ritter.
- I am, senator.

720
00:30:48,003 --> 00:30:49,752
- You're not gonna screw me, are you?
- Sir?

721
00:30:49,777 --> 00:30:51,549
Get me to meet with your boss,
then leak it to the press

722
00:30:51,574 --> 00:30:53,384
so it looks like the Democrats
are desperate for a deal?

723
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:55,025
- No, sir.
- So, where's Red?

724
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,081
- Right this way.
- Ah.

725
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,805
What the hell?

726
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,808
You didn't tell me it was a Democrat.

727
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:03,817
(both chuckle)

728
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:05,504
- Senator.
- Senator.

729
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,255
You gonna join me for a drink?

730
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,653
Uh, sure. Why not? It's 4:00 somewhere.

731
00:31:10,561 --> 00:31:12,561
(both laughing)

732
00:31:15,036 --> 00:31:16,860
Do you think they're even
talking about the budget?

733
00:31:16,885 --> 00:31:18,208
I think it may not matter.

734
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,118
Hey, I caught that
documentary of yours online.

735
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,788
The yodeling one. What was it called?

736
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:26,038
<i>- Yodeling.</i>
- Right. It was good.

737
00:31:26,063 --> 00:31:27,368
Although it just kind of ends.

738
00:31:27,393 --> 00:31:28,609
Well, it's unfinished.

739
00:31:29,414 --> 00:31:30,930
What's your next one about?

740
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,028
Melanesian choirs.

741
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:34,173
Oh, my God. You're kidding.

742
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,919
- Wait, you know what that is?
- No.

743
00:31:36,943 --> 00:31:38,464
(chuckles)

744
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:40,235
It's religious music
from the Solomon Islands.

745
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,600
Oh, so you're selling out.

746
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:43,248
(chuckles)

747
00:31:44,054 --> 00:31:45,553
Why Melanesian choirs?

748
00:31:46,829 --> 00:31:48,158
You don't want to know.

749
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,707
Yeah, I do. I'm right here.

750
00:31:50,893 --> 00:31:52,902
Okay, well, they're disappearing.

751
00:31:53,249 --> 00:31:55,918
Kids in the Solomon Islands all
want to listen to Taylor Swift.

752
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,498
So you're an idealist?

753
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,703
No. I just don't like it
when things disappear.

754
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:02,134
That's a very Republican thing to say.

755
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:03,727
Liberals love when things disappear.

756
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:04,548
They do not.

757
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:06,142
No, that's actually the
definition of being a liberal.

758
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:07,687
- Oh, my God, what a bigot.
- Wha...

759
00:32:07,712 --> 00:32:09,696
So, their culture is disappearing

760
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:10,831
- because of global warming.
- Mm-hmm.

761
00:32:10,856 --> 00:32:12,526
So tell me... what-what do
Republicans think about that?

762
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:14,578
(laughing)

763
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:15,743
You know...

764
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:18,421
- the biggest problem in this town?
- Hmm?

765
00:32:18,446 --> 00:32:19,383
Ethic rules.

766
00:32:19,408 --> 00:32:21,538
- Amen.
- Yeah. 'Cause lobbyists used to

767
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,594
- throw these great parties.
- Huge parties.

768
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:24,754
Get us all liquored up.

769
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,340
And it was all of us together,

770
00:32:26,365 --> 00:32:29,368
Democrats, Republicans,
all having a good time.

771
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:32,174
Now they can't spend more
than eight dollars on any of us.

772
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:35,918
Got those disgusting
little shrimp plates.

773
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,358
Cash bars.

774
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:40,069
I never talk to any Democrats anymore.

775
00:32:40,094 --> 00:32:41,783
So, do they train you to talk like this?

776
00:32:41,808 --> 00:32:43,368
No, I actually learned it in a book.

777
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:44,918
- I di... Yeah.
- Oh.

778
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:46,199
("You Might Think" by The Cars playing)

779
00:32:46,224 --> 00:32:48,222
There it is again... that song.

780
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:51,057
That's the third time
I've heard it today.

781
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:52,440
Is it suddenly in again?

782
00:32:52,465 --> 00:32:53,877
The '80s are back, right?

783
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:02,320
Something weird is happening.

784
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:04,328
What?

785
00:33:05,374 --> 00:33:06,616
I don't know.

786
00:33:08,335 --> 00:33:10,178
You're very easily distracted,
aren't you?

787
00:33:10,202 --> 00:33:11,499
(chuckles)

788
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,112
- Here we go.
- Okay.

789
00:33:13,113 --> 00:33:15,302
- Noon tomorrow.
- Joint press conference.

790
00:33:15,303 --> 00:33:16,512
(chuckles)

791
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:19,404
Gareth, it's time to leave
these communists.

792
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:22,504
To the Town Car. <i>Avante.</i>

793
00:33:23,981 --> 00:33:25,078
Well?

794
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,510
Well, it's your third day,

795

953
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:38,625
Where do we go?

954
00:41:52,484 --> 00:41:53,992
I'm so sorry, Luke.

955
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:57,203
Why? This is great.

956
00:41:57,907 --> 00:41:59,312
Have some dog.

957
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,043
Why are you not sad?

958
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,856
Because we're gonna destroy them.

959
00:42:05,035 --> 00:42:06,512
And you're gonna help me.

960
00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:10,753
You and Scarlett are gonna
help me kick their ass.

961
00:42:11,135 --> 00:42:12,715
Starting today.

962
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,704
Tell me what to do.

963
00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:23,034
- (chuckles)
- (phone buzzes)

964
00:42:23,035 --> 00:42:24,458
Uh, yeah.

965
00:42:25,035 --> 00:42:28,285
(The Cars' "You Might Think" playing)

966
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:45,261
<i>And as if this year
weren't dramatic enough,</i>

967
00:42:45,286 --> 00:42:47,582
<i>the senate has changed hands</i>

968
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,752
<i>in the midst of a presidential fight
for the future of this country.</i>

969
00:42:51,142 --> 00:42:53,431
<i>Well, how do we unpack all this?</i>

970
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:56,455
<i>Number one, bipartisanship is dead.</i>

971
00:42:56,643 --> 00:42:57,779
<i>Number two...</i>

972
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:03,780
