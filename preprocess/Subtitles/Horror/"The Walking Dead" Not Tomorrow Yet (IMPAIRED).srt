I'm the boss.

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:13,972
They still have Craig.

Negan?

9
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:15,941
They said they'd
return him to us,

10
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,058

Done.

15
00:00:22,983 --> 00:00:25,150
We need to know what you
know about Negan's compound.

16
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,235
We need you to come.

17
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:26,902
It's gonna be a fight.

18
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:35,037
Oh, well.

00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,201
You deserve some cookies.

Oh, no, not with
the kids as hungry--

53
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:45,940
No, there's plenty.
I foraged a lot of acorns.

54
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:54,115
- They're pink.
- Beets.

- Beets?
- It's what makes them sweet.

Oh.

Will you just put it
in your mouth, jerk.

59

They're the best beet and acorn
cookies I've ever eaten.

No.

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,340
She should inventory

67
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:53,612
We'll meet her at the pantry.

- Since we talked.

That's what we did in that cell?
We talked.

81

Why didn't you tell Rick?

Tara, Rosita, Eugene?

83
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:17,588
- Why didn't they...?
- I told them to keep quiet about it.

Why?

You know what I did.

You don't want
to tell anyone, it--

<i>They woulda killed someone

And then they
would try to own us.

And we would try to stop them.

108

it's how we keep this place.

115

It's how we feed this place.

<i>Well, they don't compromise.</i>

This isn't a compromise.

It's a choice you give them.

they always come back.

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,580
Come back
when they're dead, too.

139
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,580
Yeah, we'll stop them.
We have before.

<i>but it's not up to me.</i>

144

<i>I'll discuss it
with the people on guard now, too,</i>

What happened here,

148
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,520
<i>we won't let that happen again.</i>

149
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,370
I won't.

150
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,320
Looks like it's settled.

151
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,130
<i>We know exactly what this is.</i>

152
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,850
We don't shy from it, we live.

153
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,300
We kill them all.

154
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,980
<i>We don't all have to kill.</i>

155
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,860
But if people
are gonna stay here...

156
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,730
they do have to accept it.

157

We need someone on the
perimeter keeping watch.

159
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,940
That could be me.

160
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,040
- That would be safe.
- ( scoffs )

161
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,340
Safer.

162
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,270
Whatever safer looks like now.

163
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,690
Yeah.

164
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,220
I made that deal.

165
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,810
It wasn't my idea,
but I led us into this.

166
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,200
I have to come.

167
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,990
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

168
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,820
Those things'll kill you.

169
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,710
You got another one?

170
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,710
Not for you.

171
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,250
And why is that?

172
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,220
'Cause, asshole.

173
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,920
( chuckles )
Okay.

174
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,560
Couldn't sleep either?

175
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,510
I never could sleep.

176
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,930
Worried about tomorrow.

177
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,990
You going?

178
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,400
No.

179
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,660
You are.

180
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,650
You can
do things that--

181
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,320
that just terrify me.

182
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,290
How?

183
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,380
How do you think
I do those things?

184
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,970
You're a mom.

185
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,640
I was.

186
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,110
You<i> are.</i>

187
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,060
It-- it--

188
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,950
it's not the cookies
or the smiles.

189
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,780
It's--

190
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,280
it's the hard stuff.

191
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,570
The scary stuff.

192
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,990
It's how you can do it.

193
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,580
It's strength.

194
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,670
You're a mom to most
of the people here.

195
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,060
To you, too?

196
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,980
No.

197
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,850
You're something else to me.

198
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,870
Well, it's not tomorrow yet.

199
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,960
Packing your stilettos?

200
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,300
We'll only be gone a night.

201
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm going.

202
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,550
I am, too, but tomorrow.

203
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm leaving.

204
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,230
Why?

205
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,980
<i>It happens.</i>

206
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,070
Are you serious?

207
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,770
This is how I want it.

208
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,410
- Why?
- Why are dingleberries brown?

209
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,580
It's just the way shit is.

210
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,580
No, no. After everything
we've been through,

211
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,420
you are not walking out that
door unless you can tell me why.

212
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,140
Tell me!

213
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,220
Tell me why!

214
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,140
When I first met you,

215
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,980
I thought you were
the last woman on Earth.

216
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,260
You're not.

217
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,270
( sobbing )

218
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,120
You try one of these?
They're chewy.

219
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,460
They, uh...

220
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,930
got some fight in them.

221
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,440
Rick:
<i>Describe it.</i>

222
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,360
Andy: Rectangular building,
big satellites on it.

223
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,140
- Rick:<i> Any windows?</i>
- I don't remember any.

224
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,140
I think they made it
so there's only one way in.

225
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,480
Rick:
<i>Guards outside?</i>

226
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,820
Yeah, two of them, at least.

227
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,030
Michonne: <i>And you don't know
how many people they have?</i>

228
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,490
No.

229
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,240
Uh, I mean, no. I saw a place
where they stored food.

230
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,880
It wasn't that big, so...

231
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,960
- Rick:<i> You've been inside?</i>
- Yeah.

232
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,830
They had us load in
supplies one time.

233
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,330
Glenn: Hmm.
What do you remember?

234
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,000
Are you worried?

235
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,670
No.

236
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,890
No, it's just...

237
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,180
I love you, and I just
wanted to say it before--

238
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,680
you don't have to say it back.

239
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,150
It's--

240
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,020
I'll say it when you come back.

241
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,360
Heath and I are still
going on that two-weeker.

242
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,860
We're gonna leave from there.

243
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,530
Do you want to come?

244
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,080
I mean, I can change it so we
don't leave from the compound.

245
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,620
We could come back and we
could leave from here.

246
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,200
- You know, we're gonna get meds, so...
- I can't.

247
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,210
- No, I didn't-- I'm-- I just-- I need to be here.
- Yeah.

248
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,260
I'm the only doctor now.

249
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,790
So I can't.

250
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,460
Yeah.

251
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,300
But I want to.

252
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,300
( soft laugh )

253
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,060
I'll tell you
when you come back.

254
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,730
( both laugh )

255
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,140
Yeah.

256
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,320
Maggie: <i>And you didn't
see any other rooms?</i>

257
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,410
Andy:
No, it's a big place.

258
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,410
This is the hallway I saw.

259
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,080
There is more.

260
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,880
And every time, they had you
bring things into here?

261
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,330
Jesus.

262
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,890
We brought a couple
spears for them.

263
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,390
Two of the Saviors took
them down this hallway.

264
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,340
Now, they must've
done something with them

265
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,180
because they didn't
come back with them.

266
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,090
Jesus: <i>Maybe a weapons
locker, an armory.</i>

267
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,260
Okay.

268
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,230
We get in there,
secure the armory,

269
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,100
that's how we end it.

270
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,600
That's how Carol ended it here.

271
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,410
But we don't know if they have
an armory or where it even is.

272
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,500
Well, we've got
a lot of good guesses.

273
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,200
We've done more with less.

274
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,500
We go in at night
while they're sleeping.

275
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,290
The guards won't be sleeping.

276
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,120
Like I said, I think
there's only one way in

277
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,340
and there's no way
to bust through that door

278
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,840
<i>without waking up
the rest of them.</i>

279
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,010
We don't need to.

280
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,100
They're going to open it for
us, let us walk right in.

281
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,680
They want Gregory's head, right?

282
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,060
We're gonna give it to them.

283
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,580
<i>( brakes squealing )</i>

284
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,710
( engine stops )

285
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,800
( horns honk )

286
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,390
Aaron, Rosita.

287
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,640
You start here.

288
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,080
We'll peel off
every quarter mile,

289
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,150
meet back here
in a couple of hours.

290
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,980
See what we got.

291
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,960
There's no turning back now.

292
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,490
I could walk.

293
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,830
Maybe run a little, maybe a lot.

294
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,800
I'm not going anywhere.

295
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,250
I wanted to learn and you
taught me for a reason.

296
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,300
Why are you still wearing that?

297
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,680
It's still who I was.

298
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
I think.

299
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,850
And it'll be harder for
them to see me in the dark.

300
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,680
( chuckles )

301
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,030
I almost told everyone
at the meeting.

302
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,540
We're not telling them.

303
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,570
Morgan stood up in that church and
tried to talk us out of this.

304
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,570
What's wrong with that?

305
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,380
Maybe that he didn't know what
the hell he's talking about?

306
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,280
That he should take the win

307
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,010
that we didn't kick his ass out
for hiding that psychopath.

308
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,800
If we told everyone, they'd find
out about Denise, you know that.

309
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,640
That<i> hijo de puta</i>
tried to stand there

310
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,290
and act like we didn't
know what we were--

311
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,860
He doesn't want to kill.

312
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,640
We don't want to kill.
We don't like it.

313
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,830
It happens.

314
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,470
I'm not telling anyone.

315
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,590
( snarling )

316
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,580
What do you think?

317
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,350
Maybe.

318
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,670
If we, um, cut the hair...

319
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,620
<i>trim the beard.</i>

320
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,460
<i>If it's dark.</i>

321
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,600
We're gonna kill those people.

322
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,020
Tonight.

323
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,940
Look, I've been lucky.

324
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,240
I haven't had to do it before.

325
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,140
Have you?

326
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,150
I've been lucky, too.

327
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,410
You nervous?

328
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,710
Have you ever seen
something that, um...

329
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,990
afterwards, you--

330
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,960
you didn't want to sleep

331
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,000
and you weren't hungry because
when you close your eyes

332
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,830
you could see it?

333
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,470
- And when you try to eat--
- Yeah.

334
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,060
Me, too.

335
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,880
Killing somebody has gotta
be worse than that.

336
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,720
It has to be.

337
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,660
So, yeah...

338
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,940
I'm nervous.

339
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,110
For the whole thing, man.

340
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,160
For the whole thing.

341
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,180
Rick: We're gonna
take a look around,

342
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,050
try to get a feel for how
many people are in there.

343
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,360
We like how it looks, we go in.

344
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,810
A couple of hours before dawn.

345
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,280
The guards outside'll be tired.

346
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,730
<i>Everyone inside'll be sleeping.</i>

347
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,200
We don't like what we see, we
head back, make a new plan.

348
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,910
They don't know who we are.

349
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,040
<i>We'll keep Jesus in the shadows.</i>

350
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,610
This is how we eat.

351
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,660
This is how we eat.

352
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,640
We roll out at midnight.

353
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,470
Why is Maggie here?

354
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,630
She's guarding the perimeter.

355
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,100
Yeah, but why is she here?

356
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,740
'Cause it's her choice.

357
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,190
I want to stay
out there with her.

358
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,530
Well, this whole thing's
a race to the armory.

359
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,950
We need as many people
inside as we can get.

360
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,280
She shouldn't
be out there alone.

361
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,620
She shouldn't be out here
in the first place.

362
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,020
Okay.

363
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,460
Good.

364
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,600
She's done with the hair?

365
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,970
What've we got?

366
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,300
- That one.
- Yeah, that's it.

367
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,560
Rick:
<i>All right.</i>

368
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,280
Though, it's probably good
we're doing this at night.

369
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,060
Something wrong with it?

370
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,700
The nose. Gregory's
is a different shape.

371
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,330
He fought back.

372
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,500
He broke your hand, right?

373
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,670
Guess there's no reason
to be subtle about it.

374
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,890
What?

375
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,730
The Saviors, they're scary,

376
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,750
but those pricks
got nothing on you.

377
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:39,680
Man:
<i>Stop right there!</i>

378
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,880
<i>Announce yourself, asshole!</i>

379
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,970
It's Eddie from Hilltop!

380
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,470
It's done!

381
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,550
Man:

383

Man:

384
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,990
Yeah!

385
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,120
Man: <i>Bring it here, shit brain!</i>

386

( door opens )

387
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,010
I don't want the bag,
needle dick.

388
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:42,610
Will you look at this shit?

389
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,130
He broke my hand.
I broke his nose.

390
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,130
That's why he looks that way.

391
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,070

Little bitch broke my nose.

Okay, looks like you learned.

395
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,380
I'll get your guy,
you'll go home,

396
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,000

You still a priest?

412
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,300
Rick and Carl
taught me about guns,

413
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,970
other weapons.

414

How to contribute.

I'm still a priest.

416
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,040
I lied to my girlfriend
this morning.

417
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,990
I, um-- she caught me
thinking about something,

418
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,050
so I told her that I loved her.

419
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,670
For the first time.

420
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,590
That's how I told her,
covering something up.

421
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,340
What were you covering?

422
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,560
That I'd done something
like this before.

423
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,680
That I didn't like it.

424
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,740
Do you?

425
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,940
Do you love her?

426
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,780
Yeah.

Take a couple days before
you and Tara go out again?

No, man. I just want
to get out of here.
