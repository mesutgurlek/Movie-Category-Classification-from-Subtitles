Okay, let me have your

play capture the flag.

Gene is going to explain the rules.

you're going to be wearing white strips

00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:25,428
or blue strips. The guys with the blue
strips have to capture the white flag,

have to capture the blue flag.

sneak into the other guy's territory.

Capture his flag without getting
one of your strips taken off.
