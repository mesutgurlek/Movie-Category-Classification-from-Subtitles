Well, because that's the way
a werewolf works.

You have to shoot him

Maybe there's different

Anyway, I finally let him out.

He ran out into the woods
and he didn't come back.

I tried calling him with that dog

Nothing.

Big predators, they can travel a long
distance if their habitat runs dry.

379
00:36:08,091 --> 00:36:10,986
Just because there hasn't been
anything dangerous in this forest recently

380
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,104
doesn't mean it's always gonna be safe.

We found him on the road, a couple
hundred yards from your house.

He bore the marks of an animal attack.

491
00:50:50,097 --> 00:50:53,772
He's been torn open
by a big animal like a wolf or...

Thor almost took a bite out of Mills.

499
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,172

Yes, Janet.

That wouldn't be the same
animal that killed Mills.

506
00:51:43,651 --> 00:51:46,746
It would've had to travel 200 miles
from Timberline to get here.

That's not what I mean.

My question is...

509
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:54,708
is it possible that...

510
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:58,086
they were committed by a human being?

511

No chance at all, Janet.

512

They were done by a big animal.

513
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:10,720
No man could tear a person apart the way
the beast that butchered those people did.

The same with Mills last night.

515

Wolves are the probable culprits.

516
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,149
Very, very big wolves, but not a man.

517
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,238
Not humanly possible.

I know you love Thor.

he was doing so to protect you.
