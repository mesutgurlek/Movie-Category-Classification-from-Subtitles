1
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,978
First time giving blood?

2
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,488
Yes.

3
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,658
They pay cash here.

4
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,320
And there’s no limit
to how many times you give.

5
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,454
They even buy it
in the jar.

6
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,659
Jared Nomak,
we’re ready for you.

7
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,906
In the past 12 months,
have you gotten a tattoo,

8
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,918
or undergone any ear,
skin, or body piercings?

9
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,453
No.

10
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,955
Where did you get
that scar on your chin?

11
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,160
Childhood accident.

12
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,196
You say you don’t have
any immediate next of kin,

13
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,788
- is that right?
- Not that I’m in contact with.

14
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,959
Nobody to call in case
of an emergency?

15
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,627
No one.

16
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:46,297
- No family?
- I told you, no.

17
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:50,706
Are you telling me
I can’t be a donor?

18
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,075
It depends.
We came up

19
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,137
with some unusual results
on your blood test.

20
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,149
What?

21
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,151
How unusual?

22
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,251
Let me explain.

23
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:05,086
Your blood has
a very rare phenotype,

24
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,524
one we haven’t
encountered before.

25
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,897
What? What are you
talking about?

26
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,403
- Who are you? No.
- Sit down, please.

27
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,096
What is this?

28
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:25,975
This is a good news-bad news
scenario, Jared.

29
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,808
Good news for us...

30
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,009
bad news...

31
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,017
...for you.

32
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:41,679
Forget what you think
you know--

33
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,518
vampires exist.

34
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,696
My name is Blade.

35
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:54,426
I was born half human,
half vampire.

36
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:59,632
They call me
"The Daywalker."

37
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,972
I have all their strengths,

38
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,807
none of their weaknesses.

39
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,404
Except for the thirst.

40
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,982
20 years ago I met a man
that changed that.

41
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:17,454
Whistler.

42
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,321
He taught me how to hold
the thirst at bay.

43
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,827
Taught me the rules.

44
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,489
Gave me the weapons
to hunt with.

45
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:29,126
Silver, garlic,

46
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,329
sunlight.

47
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,998
Two years ago
he was attacked.

48
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,665
They took him,

49
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:39,075
and turned him into
the thing I hate most.

50
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,507
I should have
finished him off.

51
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,778
Now I’m hunting him.

52
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,056
I will find him.

53
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,457
And nothing will stand
in my way.

54
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,484
Daywalker’s here!
Stop him!

55
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,391
Where is he?

56
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,475
Hey!

57
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,883
No, no.

58
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:25,299
Take me to him, and I’ll
consider you a loose end.

59
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,312
Catch you later.

60
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:31,523
Old man... Look at what
they’ve done to you.

61
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,405
Let’s go home.

62
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,958
Lock up your daughters,
boys and girls,

63
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,759
the dark knight returns.

64
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,799
- Need a toke of the smokage, B?
- Later.

65
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,033
Cut the lights.

66
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,342
You found him.

67
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,853
You didn’t kill him.

68
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:46,585
Give me a hand.

69
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,688
I got a bad feeling
about this, B.

70
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,028
Listen to his breathing.
He’s already dying. He’s in pain.

71
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,036
Why don’t you just put him
out of his misery right now?

72
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,231
They had him on stasis
in a halfway house.

73
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:05,141
I’m giving him an accelerated
retro-viral detox.

74
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,476
Like a heroin addict.

75
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,515
Make him go cold turkey
in one night.

76
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,346
Shit ain’t
going to work, man.

77
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,511
I say you kill the motherfucker
right now.

78
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,350
Get out.

79
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,663
If there’s anything left
of you in there, Whistler,

80
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,134
Listen up.

81
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:35,139
In the morning those blinds
are going to open

82
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,334
whether you’re cured...

83
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,343
or not.

84
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,521
Hey, man,
I didn’t mean to call him--

85
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,965
Listen to me, Blade.

86
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,595
You’re going to have
to finish me off.

87
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,070
No.

88
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,597
Give me
that damn gun.

89
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,906
Now walk away.

90
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,578
Stubborn son of a bitch.

91
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,305
How do you feel?

92
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,478
Like hammered shit.

93
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,285
How’d you find me?

94
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,619
I started out in Moscow.
Then Romania.

95
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:10,651
- They kept moving you around.
- How long was I gone?

96
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,566
- Months?
- Too long.

97
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,802
Years.

98
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,677
They tortured me
almost to death.

99
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,808
And then let me heal
in a vat of blood

100
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,786
so they could go
at it again.

101
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,983
Sorry sons of bitches
could have at least

102
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,323
fixed my goddamn leg
while they were at it.

103
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,057
Where’s my arc welder?

104
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,107
What’s up? Nice to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.

105
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:09,621
I’m Josh. You can call me "Scud."
Everybody does.

106
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,464
Tell me something, Skid--

107
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,901
No, man, it’s "Scud,"
like "Stud."

108
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,632
Whatever.

109
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,732
- What are you doing here?
- The pimpmobile?

110
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,334
Just a little aftermarket
modification.

111
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,811
- Nitrous oxide and shit like that.
- Oh, yeah.

112
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,474
You gave it a more aggressive
exhaust profile ramping.

113
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,746
The whole package will crank
that Betty up, maybe 300 horsepower.

114
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,982
You’ll burn the thing out
before your next oil change.

115
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,923
Where did you dig up
this shitbird, anyway?

116
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,823
What the fuck
is your problem, Poppy?

117
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,022
My problem is I’ve been
sucking blood clots for two years.

118
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:55,555
I get out to find some jerkoff
fucking with my life’s work.

119
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,000
We jeopardized our whole
operation to save your ass!

120
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,537
- Our operation?
- Yeah.

121
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:03,564
Our operation? I built
this operation, you ass-wipe!

122
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,747
Motion sensors!
It’s on three, gentlemen.

123
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,680
Human?

124
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,447
Body temperature, 50.
I’d guess suckhead.

125
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,787
Fried. They’re using
magnesium flares.

126
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,991
They’ve got your security
system scoped out.

127
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,126
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don’t trust you--

128
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,410
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

129
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,848
Cool outfit.

130
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,357
Guard lights!

131
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,707
We represent the ruling body
of the Vampire Nation.

132
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,075
They are offering you
a truce.

133
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,847
They want to meet
with you.

134
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,187
Scud.

135
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,863
Take off your mask.

136
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:55,171
My name is Asad.
This is Nyssa.

137
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,135
You have been our most
feared enemy.

138
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,705
But now there’s something else
loose on the streets.

139
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,343
Something worse
than you.

140
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,168
What’s so funny?

141
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,933
They tell stories about Blade
as the Bogeyman.

142
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,837
Frankly,
I’m disappointed.

143
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:34,174
You hear that, B?
She’s disappointed.

144
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,704
He agreed
to come along so easily.

145
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:41,514
Come on, B, show her.
Pretty please?

146
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,380
Semtex.

147
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,527
Enough explosives
to level a city block.

148
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,025
You still disappointed?

149
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:20,157
The guards look human.
They’re probably familiars.

150
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,503
You sure about this?

151
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,013
Well, if I’m not...

152
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,391
The true power
of the Vampire Nation lies here.

153
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,031
Father?

154
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:22,649
Blade, this is
Overlord Eli Damaskinos.

155
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,123
It has been said,
"Be proud of your enemy

156
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,322
and enjoy his success."

157
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:35,423
In that regard,
I should thank you.

158
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,333
- For what?
- Eliminating Deacon Frost.

159
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,668
You did us a favor.
Karel Kounen.

160
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,709
- You’re human.
- Barely. I’m a lawyer.

161
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,008
European Health Consortium.

162
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,413
As you may know,
Vampirism is...

163
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:57,683
a horrible virus, carried
in the saliva of predators.

164
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:01,749
In 72 hours, it spreads through
the human bloodstream,

165
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:05,284
creating new
parasitic organs.

166
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,024
Like cancer.

167
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:12,234
Cancer with a purpose.

168
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,468
Unfortunately,
viruses evolve, too.

169
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,634
We’ve encountered
a new one.

170
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,575
We dubbed it
the Reaper Strain.

171
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:25,082
And like any good pathogen,
it appears to have found a carrier.

172
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,886
There...
Jared Nomak.

173
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,420
Born a vampire,
but an anomaly like you.

174
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,094
Unlike the rest of us,
however,

175
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:46,035
he feeds on not just humans,

176
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,073
but vampires as well.

177
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,008
- Looks like he was doing me a favor.
- You’re missing the point.

178
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,103
Their vampire victims
don’t die...

179
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:59,014
they turn.
They become carriers.

180
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:02,110
You’ve got to understand.
These things are like crack addicts.

181
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:06,954
They need to feed daily.
Nomak’s been up for 72 hours.

182
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:10,791
By our estimates, there are already
a dozen Reapers.

183
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,353
There’ll be hundreds
before the week is out.

184
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:17,458
Thousands within a matter of months.
Do the math.

185
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,469
Wait. Let me get
this right.

186
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:23,735
You want me
to hunt them... for you?

187
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,139
When they are finished
with us,

188
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,475
who do you think
they’ll turn on next?

189
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:31,242
Your precious humans.

190
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,150
Not one of them
will be left.

191
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,984
We spent two years training
a small tactical unit--

192
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,752
The Bloodpack.
We want you to lead them.

193
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,850
Two years?

194
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,390
We’ve been training
to hunt you.

195
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:51,835
So, B-man,
what do you think?

196
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,167
Sounds like a plan.

197
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,230
What do you really think?

198
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:59,174
They’re going to fuck us
the first chance they get.

199
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:03,771
So, we ain’t
gonna do this, right?

200
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,782
We’ll play along for now.

201
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,785
They’ll take us in deeper
than we’ve ever been.

202
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,788
Get a chance to see
how their world really ticks.

203
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,290
I had enough of their world.

204
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,293
They’re just shitting bricks

205
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,455
because they’re no longer
top of the food chain.

206
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,297
Damn, man,
I’m really worried about him.

207
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,302
I know he’s
your friend and all,

208
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,634
but I think you should
watch him.

209
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:32,143
Nobody goes cold turkey
from the thirst in just one night.

210
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,777
Looking to get
hooked up?

211
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,288
Maybe.
What do you have?

212
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,948
No problem.

213
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:24,484
Horse, Hawaiian Ice,
whatever you need.

214
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:27,292
Whatever I need.

215
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:31,165
I like that.
What if I need you?

216
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,045
So, so sweet.

217
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:27,716
They are ready
whenever you are, Daywalker.

218
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:44,173
Blade,
meet The Bloodpack.

219
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:49,543
Lighthammer,
Verlaine,

220
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:53,482
Priest,
Snowman,

221
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,315
Chupa,
and Reinhardt.

222
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,002
Hey, um...

223
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,436
me and the gang
were wondering...

224
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:20,002
What was that?

225
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:23,013
Can you blush?

226
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,572
Here we go.

227
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,852
Oh, I get it.

228
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,753
I see now.

229
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:36,521
You’ve been training for two years
to take me out.

230
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,290
And now, here I am.

231
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:43,164
Ooh, so exciting,
isn’t it?

232
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:46,067
Okay, here’s your chance.

233
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:51,406
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

234
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,341
Here I am.
Right here in front of you.

235
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,005
Adolf here gets the first shot.
Come on.

236
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,174
What are you looking at her for?
You need permission?

237
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,411
Maybe you need
a little bit of incentive.

238
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,454
Okay, I can help
with that.

239
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,782
What’s the matter?
Missed that?

240
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,588
It’s okay,
I can do it again.

241
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,961
Come on.
What, do you need a manual?

242
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,695
- Do it!
- Kill the bastard!

243
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:29,410
Now you’ve got an explosive device
stuck to the back of your head.

244
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,416
Silver nitrate. Rigged to go off
if anybody tampers with it.

245
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,679
I’ll have
the detonator with me.

246
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:39,655
And you-- if you so much
as look at me wrong--

247
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,058
From now on
we work as a unit.

248
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,190
You’ll be taking
orders from me.

249
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,863
Any questions?

250
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,206
Good.

251
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,215
You want to catch the hunter?
You start with the prey.

252
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:12,382
We’ll target all the night places
where vampires congregate.

253
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,084
Blood banks, safe houses.

254
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,649
The bigger the better.

255
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:20,494
So... what’s first?

256
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,131
The House of Pain.

257
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,015
Where’s the entrance?

258
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,610
I don’t see any signs.

259
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,179
No vampire glyphs.

260
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:50,023
No, because of you,
we’ve had to rethink our habits,

261
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,688
tighten our security.

262
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,324
Have a closer look.

263
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,603
Nice.

264
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,473
.38, .45
and 9mm caliber.

265
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,979
All with foil capsules
at the tip

266
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,141
filled with silver nitrate,
and garlic extract.

267
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,309
This hyper-velocity
stake gun

268
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,718
spits out a silver stake
at 6,000 feet per second.

269
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:20,053
Since you suckers
don’t like sunlight,

270
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,924
we’ve modified the gun’s
entry light with a UV filter.

271
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,759
Pop it open--
instant UV light.

272
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,501
Filter’s on,
no problem.

273
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,195
Yo, B, check this out.

274
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,534
It’s got an pneumatic
syringe delivery system.

275
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,438
The vials are filled with
an anti-coagulant called EDTA.

276
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:40,705
One punch with this, you’ll blow
your target up like a balloon.

277
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:43,645
The cartridge ejects.
Automatic reload.

278
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,614
Nice.

279
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,513
- Let’s go.
- You won’t pass for one of us.

280
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:54,524
- Like I give a shit.
- No, he’s right.

281
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,856
Why don’t you post up
on the roof over there?

282
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,396
Cover our backs.

283
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:03,560
So the Bloodpack’s calling
the shots now, huh?

284
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,795
Great.

285
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:11,106
Better curb that dog of yours
or we’ll do it for you.

286
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,909
Keep pushing, asshole.

287
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,663
[M] I ya, I against I [M]

288
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:38,167
[M] Flesh of my flesh
and mind of my mind [M]

289
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,329
[M] Two of a kind,
but one won’t survive [M]

290
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,838
[M] My images reflect
in the enemy’s eye [M]

291
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,671
[M] And his images reflect
in mine the same time [M]

292
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,836
[M] I ya, I ya, I against I [M]

293
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:50,779
[M] Flesh of my flesh
and mind of my mind [M]

294
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,009
[M] Two of a kind,
but one won’t survive [M]

295
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,018
[M] Survive, survive,
survive. [M]

296
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,126
We’re in.

297
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:13,462
You’re about
to enter our world.

298
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,632
You will see things--
feeding.

299
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,505
Just remember
why you’re here.

300
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,772
I haven’t forgotten.

301
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:37,159
What exactly
are we looking for in here?

302
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:40,254
Anything that looks
suspicious.

303
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,596
You got to be
kidding me.

304
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,857
Scud, do you read me?

305
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:52,328
- Scud, you reading me?
- Reading you loud and clear.

306
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,337
The whole place
is a safe house.

307
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,839
The windows are painted black,
one access door.

308
00:37:56,907 --> 00:38:01,276
- 200, 300 suckheads in here.
- That sounds cool.

309
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:03,677
Hey, W, you got me?

310
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,784
W?

311
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,855
Tell me something,
how’s the weather up there?

312
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,792
Walkin’ on sunshine,
toad boy.

313
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,465
Look at them.
Half of these bastards,

314
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,300
they’re not even
pure bloods.

315
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:33,036
I tell you what, why don’t we
just fucking kill everyone?

316
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,805
Just to make sure.

317
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,314
God, it would be
so easy.

318
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,166
He’s got you.

319
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,763
Daywalker.

320
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,204
Mother’s milk.

321
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,875
I say we got about half an hour
till sunrise, Cinderella.

322
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,508
Hurry up.

323
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,066
I spotted one,
but lost it.

324
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,265
Be on the lookout.

325
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,179
Fuck.

326
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:57,373
Whistler, they’re
on the roof.

327
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,170
I got them on the roof
of my bus.

328
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,468
Shhh.

329
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,596
Nomak.

330
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,294
Daywalker.

331
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:34,166
What am I to you?

332
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:37,264
Is the enemy
of my enemy my friend...

333
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,434
or my enemy?

334
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,525
We’re under attack!

335
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:01,461
There’s three of them.
Probably more.

336
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,134
Daylight.

337
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,571
Silver don’t do jack shit.
Don’t waste the bullets!

338
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,177
- Motherfucker.
- You hear me, Chupa?

339
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:04,948
Say, "cheese."

340
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,106
Come on.

341
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,780
How about some daylight,
motherfucker?

342
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,165
Fuck!

343
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:03,785
Listen to me. If you’re under attack,
use your UV lights.

344
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,226
Use your UV lights.
They can’t take the light.

345
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,676
Priest?
We’re not dying here.

346
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:02,115
- Come on.
- Priest is down.

347
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:10,090
Daylight’s coming.
You’re on your own, Blade.

348
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:37,280
You want me so bad, Blade?

349
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,447
Here I am.

350
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,392
Why kill me?

351
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,863
You and I,
we have the same enemy.

352
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,594
We want the same thing.

353
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,492
We need the same thing,
Blade.

354
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:26,813
What happened?

355
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,824
Why didn’t you tell me
these things

356
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:31,986
- were immune to silver and garlic?
- I didn’t know.
