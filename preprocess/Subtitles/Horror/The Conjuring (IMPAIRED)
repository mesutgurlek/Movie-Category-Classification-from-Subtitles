think we're insane.

ED-
Try us. Please, from the start.

4
00:00:34,147 --> 00:00:39,141
DEBBIE- It started out small,
Like a hand or a Leg was in a different position.

5
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,810
Then its head was Looking up
instead of down.

6
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:45,014
And then one day, it was in
a completely different room.

7
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:46,716
It was moving around by itself.

8

to your apartment and was playing a trick?

DEBBIE-
That's exactly what we thought.

10
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:56,095
But never once did we find any
sign or evidence of intrusion.

11
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:58,999

that the doll was possessed?

Yes.

13
00:01:00,707 --> 00:01:04,438
Camilla got in touch with a medium.
We learned from her that a 7-year-old girl...

14
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:07,512
...named Annabelle Higgins
had died in this apartment.

15
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:11,378
She was lonely and took a Liking
to my doll.

16

All she wanted was to be friends.

When we heard this,
we felt reality sorry for her.

I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

So...

to move into the doll.

Wait, you did what?

22
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,367
She wanted to Live with us
by inhabiting the doll.

23
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:30,696
We said yes.

It's something demonic.

So the doll was never possessed?

51
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:37,155
No, no, it was used as a conduit.

52
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:39,656
It was moved around to give
the impression of possession.

they possess people.

So all these are taken from cases
you've investigated?

243
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:32,837
That's right. Everything you see
in here is either haunted, cursed...

244
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:35,940
...or has been used in some kind

right in your home?

once a month to bless the room.

It's safer for these things
to be in here than out there.

and anxiety caused by the presence...

...or imminence of danger.

spoke some of the best Latin I'd ever heard.

He'd been molested by his father,
who had also tortured him repeatedly.

No, I'm not authorized.
But I've assisted on many.

544
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:18,167
See, an exorcism
can be very dangerous...

545
00:44:18,336 --> 00:44:21,362
...not only for the victim,
but for anyone in the room.

546
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:24,473
- What happened to Maurice?
ED- He tried to kill his wife...

547
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:27,973
...but instead shot her in the arm
and then turned the gun on himself.

Maurice had a very troubled Life
with little to Live for...

could bring him back.

00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:38,212
Which brings us to the three stages
of demonic activity-

551
00:44:38,389 --> 00:44:40,584
Infestation, oppression and possession.

552
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:42,157
Now, infestation-

553
00:44:42,326 --> 00:44:46,262
That's the whispering, the footsteps,
the feeling of another presence...

554
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:50,127
...which ultimately grows
into oppression, the second stage.

555
00:44:50,301 --> 00:44:52,531
Now this is where the victim,
and it's usually the one...

556
00:44:52,703 --> 00:44:54,568
...who's the most
psychologically vulnerable...

557
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:57,606
...is targeted specifically
by an external force.

Breaks the victim down.
Crushes their will.

00:49:48,866 --> 00:49:50,834
Mom and Dad tell me
that you have a friend.

641
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:53,196
His name's Rory.
He lives here too.

642
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,201
- Hmm.
- But he's always sad.

643
00:49:55,372 --> 00:49:56,396
Why is that?

644
00:49:56,573 --> 00:50:00,373
He won't tell me but I think
something bad happened to him.

645
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,344
Do you mind if I try to see Rory?

{ROPE SQUEAKING}

652
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:14,803
We bought it at auction from the bank, so,
you know, we never knew who lived here.

653
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:24,681
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that
what your house needs is a cleansing.

654
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:27,183
An exorcism.

655
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:30,225
What, exorcism?

656
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:35,165
I thought that was something
that you do to people.

657
00:52:35,332 --> 00:52:36,697
LORRAINE-
No, not necessarily, no.

658
00:52:37,334 --> 00:52:38,665
We have to get out of here.

659
00:52:38,836 --> 00:52:40,827
I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

660
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:45,137
Lorraine saw something, which-

661
00:52:45,309 --> 00:52:46,606
Go ahead, hon.

662
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:52,379
I've been seeing the dark entity
that haunts your house...

663
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:54,039
...and your Land.

664
00:52:58,622 --> 00:53:02,080
I saw it first when I came
through your door.

665
00:53:02,259 --> 00:53:04,489
It was Latched to your back.

666
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:11,028
And then I saw it again with the girls
when we walked into the Living room.

667
00:53:11,935 --> 00:53:14,233
And it doesn't matter where you go...

668
00:53:14,404 --> 00:53:17,532
...this dark entity has Latched itself
to your family...

669
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:19,198
...and it's feeding off you.

670
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:24,406
Even if we Leave?

671
00:53:24,581 --> 00:53:27,243
Sometimes when you get haunted,
it's Like stepping on gum.

672
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:29,716
You take it with you.

673
00:53:30,654 --> 00:53:33,851
LORRAINE- Look, I gotta tell you,
you have a lot of spirits in here...

674
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:38,654
...but this is the one that I'm most
worried about, because it is so hateful.

675
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:42,365
Okay, so what do we do?
Can we call a priest?

676
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:43,795
ED-
I wish it were that easy.

677
00:53:43,967 --> 00:53:47,960
Performing an exorcism is an archaic
procedure. Requires years of training.

678
00:53:48,872 --> 00:53:52,899
And even then,
I have seen it go horribly wrong.

679
00:53:53,877 --> 00:53:57,574
But before we even get that far,
the church has to authorize it first.

680
00:53:57,748 --> 00:54:00,979
It means we gotta investigate,
gather evidence and provide proof...

681
00:54:01,184 --> 00:54:02,674
...and that's the hard part.

682
00:54:04,821 --> 00:54:06,550
Have your children been baptized?

683
00:54:06,723 --> 00:54:10,989
Uh, no, we never got around to that.
We're not reality a churchgoing family.

684
00:54:11,261 --> 00:54:14,856
Well, you may want to rethink that.
Our presence here could make things worse.

685
00:54:15,032 --> 00:54:16,124
Why?

686
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,665
Because we're a threat.

687
00:54:17,834 --> 00:54:20,735
And whatever you're dealing with here
isn't gonna Like us.

688
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:24,465
So far it hasn't done anything violent,
and that's a good sign.

689
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:27,542
So we're gonna have our guy
do some homework on the property...

690
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:29,474
...to see what we're up against.

691
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:33,511
LORRAINE-
Judy, what are you up to?

692
00:54:33,684 --> 00:54:36,448
- I got you a present.
- Aah.

693
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:39,714

we'll always be together.

00:55:22,733 --> 00:55:24,564
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

707
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:28,171
...who, with her family, has been
experiencing supernatural occurrences.

708
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:29,903
Okay, go ahead.

709
00:55:33,143 --> 00:55:34,940
From the first occurrence.

710
00:55:38,548 --> 00:55:39,810
Nothing.

711
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:41,577
The whole time.

712
00:55:41,752 --> 00:55:44,312
- I don't know. You find anything?
- Lots.

713
00:55:44,955 --> 00:55:47,890
I mean, it's no wonder they're
going through what they are.

714
00:55:48,191 --> 00:55:50,091
That's the original farmhouse.

715
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,354
It was built in 1863 by a man
named Jedson Sherman...

716
00:55:53,563 --> 00:55:56,088
...who was married to a woman
named Bathsheba.

717
00:55:56,466 --> 00:55:59,526
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

718
00:55:59,703 --> 00:56:01,864
She was one of the women
accused of witchcraft in Salem.

719
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:03,973
- She was hung during the trials.
- Wow.

720
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:07,008
After Bathsheba married Jedson,
they had a baby...

721
00:56:07,177 --> 00:56:09,008
...and when the baby was 7 days old...

722
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:12,046
...Jedson caught her sacrificing it
in front of the fireplace.

723
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:14,308
She ran out to that tree by the dock...

724
00:56:14,484 --> 00:56:16,645
...climbed up, proclaimed her Love
to Satan...

725
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,688
...cursed anyone who tried
to take her Land, and hung herself.

726
00:56:22,526 --> 00:56:26,087
Time of death was pronounced at 3-07
in the morning.

727
00:56:26,496 --> 00:56:28,225
Well, that explains a few things.

728
00:56:28,398 --> 00:56:30,093
Yeah, so does this.

729
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:33,434
Her Last name's Walker.
She lived there in the '30s.

730
00:56:33,603 --> 00:56:36,663
She had a boy named Rory who
mysteriously disappeared in the woods.

731
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,603
Then she killed herself in the cellar.

732
00:56:39,676 --> 00:56:40,700
And that's not all.

733
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:48,082
So, what was the original 200-acre farm
has since been subdivided and sold off.

734
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:52,210
There was another boy who drowned in
a pond here. He lived in a house over here.

735
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:56,519
And a woman who worked as a maid in a
neighbouring home, she committed suicide too.
