It's just a big fat arrow
pointing away from the problem.

Especially shows like this.

It's like the lead in the water pipes

"OK, I can ignore it,

"or I can engage with
and alter it from within."

the same mistake till, what, half three?

Yeah, thereabouts.

we fully went through

They might bump tonight's show.

165
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,300
- Why?
- Because of this shit.

166
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,660
One fucking estate on fire
in Newcastle

167
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,980
and a couple of policemen
killed in Liverpool.

(Patrick) Why do people riot,
anyway? It's not the '80s.

173
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:59,560
You know, they've got distractions.
They should stay in, watch telly.

I'm just not feeling this no more.

182
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,780
they can't kill because of
all the preservatives in the steam.

I didn't know what your question was,
cos you kinda stuttered it. "Are you..."?

205
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,100
He said to me, "Oh, how do you feel
about your country?"

206
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,180
And I'm thinking, "I'm African."

I'm gonna make some eggs.
You want some?

There aren't any.

493
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,820
Grayson had a fried-egg sandwich
last night.

I'm surprised you're not...

You haven't had your mike on

Why didn't you say something?

They're idiots, sweetheart.

00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,220
or just tell you to come in
and act weird?

600

(Joplin) Dear Big Brother,
may I say how impressed I was

629
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,420
at your inclusion of a clearly
mentally unhinged woman

630
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,180
into the house?

631
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,660
Maybe something has happened.

632
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:39,300
(Veronica) I just wanna know, is that
fake blood? I just wanna know.

633
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,780
(Joplin) Even if she's not mentally ill,
this is in very poor taste.

634
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:45,700
(Marky) You seriously think
there's a bunch of dead biffers

They're coming to get you, Barbara.

Well, I just want it noted
that I do not approve of this.

638
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,900
Shut up! Shut up, you fucking idiots!

639
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:00,620
You fucking idiots! I'm trying
to tell you there's one in there!

640
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,300
INDISTINCT YELLING

641
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:06,660
YELLING
Calm down. Just calm down.

642
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,740
KNOCKING
(Marky) Oi, mate! Mate!

643
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,540
You're live on Channel 4!
Don't swear or say "fuck" or nothing!

644
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:15,050
Maybe he's deaf and dead.

645
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,660
Hello? Hello?

646
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,260
No, can't hear anything.

647
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,380
Don't do that.
(Marky) There's nothing here.

648
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:25,700
(Veronica) Marky, get away from that.
It's the fire exit.

649
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:27,180
Don't open that door.

650
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,100
What, this door?

651
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:31,300
- Open that door and I'll stab you.
- What?

652
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,780
Marky, don't wind her up.
Seriously, she's fucking weird.

653
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:37,260
Shut the door!
(Angel) Shut the door!

654
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,940
Shut the fucking door!

655
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,740
- Close it! Fucking close the door!
- Marky, close it.

656
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,900
You fucking well
better close the fucking door!

657
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,820
All right! Fucking hell!

658
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,300
What you gonna do with them?

659
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,150
Sorry. I'm just having a look.

660
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:02,300
SCREAMING

661
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,740
In the head.

662
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,050
You've got to get them in the head.
