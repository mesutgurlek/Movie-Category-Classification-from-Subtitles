1
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,197
Catch them.

2
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,295
Kill them.

3
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,034
What's wrong, Ronnie?

4
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,974
I Iove you, Jodie.

5
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,826
Suffolk County police.
May I help you?

6
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,524
Everybody's dead.

7
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,665
What do you mean,
"everybody's dead"?

8
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,905
A guy come running
into the bar and says...

9
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,439
...his mother and father are shot.

10
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,338
I've been to a Iot of crime scenes,
never seen one Iike this.

11
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,003
Six members of the family
were found last night...

12
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,214
...in bed, shot...

13
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,178
...and killed.

14
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,950
Killed were car dealer Ronald Defeo,
his wife and four of their children.

15
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,751
The sole survivor of the family...

16
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,190
...23-year-old
Ronald "Butch" Defeo Jr...

17
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,262
...is said to have discovered
the bodies.

18
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,422
The police state
that for his own safety...

19
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,761
... they're holding him
in protective custody.

20
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,699
Five of the victims were found
shot facedown on their beds.

21
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,034
The sixth was found in a closet.

22
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,410
No one seemed to stir in their sleep.
It's strange.

23
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,446
Suffolk County police have charged
23-year-old Ronald Defeo Jr.

24
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,607
The accused told police
he heard voices...

25
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:15,083
...coming from within the house,
telling him to murder his family.

26
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,860
Oh, God!

27
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,896
Damn it.

28
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,150
Hi, Michael.

29
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,146
Oh, hey, baby. You okay?

30
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,311
George, what are you doing
to my mom?

31
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,715
Nothing.

32
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,654
-Yet.
-You perv.

33
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,728
Come on up here, Iittle man.

34
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,872
You can make it.

35
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,540
Oh, you're getting heavy.

36
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,045
Did you meet my dad?

37
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,981
No...

38
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,654
...never had the pleasure, pal.

39
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,819
Do I have to call you "Dad" now?

40
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,321
-Guess what.
-What?

41
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,392
-You can call me whatever you want.
-Anything?

42
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,556
-Yep.
-Cool.

43
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,634
-Anything.
-Cool.

44
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,430
Yeah.

45
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,903
-Stinky.
-Sure.

46
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,632
-Poopy-head.
-Yeah.

47
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,640
Crap-monkey-fart.

48
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,110
Okay, we gotta draw the Iine
somewhere, pal, that does it.

49
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,484
AII right.

50
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,722
-This sucks.
-You're not kidding.

51
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,364
Billy.

52
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,768
Look, maybe we'II grab you
something on the way to school.

53
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,905
-What do you say, huh?
-I'm not hungry. I can walk to school.

54
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,632
No, you can't, and get
your feet off the chair.

55
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,369
I'II drop you a couple blocks away.
Nobody'd see.

56
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,512
-Mom, I'm 1 2 years old.
-Before you plan...

57
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,513
...your retirement party, we're gonna
drop you off at school.

58
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,617
We got a big day.

59
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,778
Why? Where are you guys going?

60
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,219
-Mom, can you help me?
-Oh, Michael.

61
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,324
Houses here are way out
of our price range, Kath.

62
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,195
Not according to this.

63
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,963
-Well, then it's gotta be true.
-Think positive, babe.

64
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,597
I'm positive that houses here
are out of our price range.

65
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,775
Look, when the business
is going good...

66
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,174
-...we're gonna--
-There.

67
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,576
-What?
-That's it.

68
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,444
-Look.
-Honey.

69
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,415
Baby, Iook, 41 2 Ocean Avenue.

70
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,760
-It's beautiful.
-What?

71
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,245
Look at how friendly they are here,
honey.

72
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,938
They get Iike that when they think
they'II make a sale.

73
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:34,280
Let's just play it cool, Kath.
Kathy. Katherine.

74
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,545
Or not.

75
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,088
-Hi there.
-I'm Katherine Lutz.

76
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,426
Well, just call me Edith.
This is your husband?

77
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,069
-George.
-This is an amazing house.

78
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:55,264
You are going to Iove it.
Just follow me in here.

79
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,700
Careful on the steps there.

80
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,722
Holy shit.

81
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,157
Excuse me.

82
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,700
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

83
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,904
This-- This is a mistake.

84
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,370
How's that?

85
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,702
No, I mean your ad in the paper.

86
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,502
This is--

87
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,840
It's gotta be a misprint.
I'm a contractor...

88
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,415
...and I know what a place
Iike this should cost.

89
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,881
And, you know, if this is--

90
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,681
Well, if this is true, then this is a--
The deal of a Iifetime.

91
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,217
And what is wrong with that?

92
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,890
-Come on.
-I Iove it.

93
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,965
-There's a vibrant history here.
-Vibrant history, George.

94
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:00,867
In fact, the house was built
in 1 692, at Ieast the basement.

95
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,875
The rest of the house was added
from that foundation.

96
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,534
It's one of the oldest Dutch Colonials
in Long Island.

97
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,077
Wow, that's impressive.

98
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,375
This room would be perfect
for children, if you have any.

99
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,612
And the view's--
Well, have a Iook for yourselves.

100
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,984
There's a boathouse.

101
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,127
Oh, all you need now
is a boat, right?

102
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,321
Actually, George has a speedboat.

103
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,334
This place sounds
Iike it's made for you.

104
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,705
And this is your basement.

105
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,045
As you can see,
it's very spacious.

106
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,846
It can be a game room,
a playroom.

107
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,852
Well, Iet's-- Let's have a Iook.

108
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,688
I'II just wait up here.

109
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,534
Yep, Iooks Iike a basement.

110
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,731
So, what do you guys think?

111
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:14,209
-I think you Iook foxy in that skirt.
-Will you stop it? Come on.

112
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,018
Yes, yes, okay?

113
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,353
It's a value. It's a value
for people with money.

114
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,624
Okay, Iook, if we do this, we're
gonna be eating dry wall for a year.

115
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,461
We deserve this, George.

116
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,729
You deserve this.

117
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,600
How many times you tell me
how hard you work for so Iittle.

118
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,436
-Kathy--
-Maybe today is the day it all pays off.

119
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,337
-We'II make sacrifices.
-Huge sacrifices.

120
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,505
Yeah, I understand that.
Listen, honey...

121
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,947
...this is the Iife we want.

122
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,695
-We're happy?
-Yes, we're happy.

123
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,395
She's happy. I'm broke.

124
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,874
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

125
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:21,308
So Iook, I gotta ask,
what's the catch?

126
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,746
There's always a catch.

127
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,679
There was a tragedy, a crime...

128
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,586
-...a murder.
-I'm sorry, what?

129
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,691
In the house?

130
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,996
Several people, a family.

131
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,633
But, you know, we've moved on,
the whole town.

132
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,498
It is a distant memory now.

133
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,502
And the house is fine.

134
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,198
Really.

135
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,037
Doesn't it seem kind of strange
to buy this house, honey?

136
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,407
Well, houses don't kill people.

137
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,912
People kill people.

138
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,211
Just-- Excuse us.

139
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,121
Do you think we can make it work?

140
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,361
You know what?

141
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,962
You want it,
then we're gonna make it work.

142
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,297
-Really?
-I'II work out of the basement...

143
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,269
...and you can, well...

144
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,141
-...sell one of the kids.
-Hey.

145
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,334
A Iittle one.

146
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,124
We're rich! We're rich!

147
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,393
We're rich in something,
but it ain't money.

148
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,401
Wait.

149
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,973
-You say your prayers?
-Yep, said them twice.

150
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:37,979
-What did you pray for?
-If I tell you, it won't come true.

151
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,814
Why don't you tell him the truth.

152
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,477
-What?
-Praying doesn't do any good.

153
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,322
William.

154
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:49,051
Nobody answered me when
I asked for Dad to be kept alive.

155
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,165
Don't say that.

156
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,662
Sometimes things happen in Iife
that can't be explained, Billy.

157
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,371
Billy, Iook at me.

158
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,716
I need you to give George
a chance, okay?

159
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:17,016
You're not being disloyal
to Dad by Iiking George.

160
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,018
He doesn't want to be anything
but your friend...

161
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,425
...and maybe one day
something more.

162
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,055
Nobody will ever
replace your dad, honey.

163
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,196
For you too?

164
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,632
For me too.

165
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,817
How's Billy?

166
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,984
He'II be fine.

167
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,553
-First call.
-First call.

168
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,790
-Lutz residence, how may I help you?
-Can I talk to my daughter, please?

169
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,300
Yeah, sure, she's--
She's right here. Okay.

170
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,234
Your mother's gotta stop
gushing over me, seriously.

171
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,343
It's embarrassing now.

172
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,641
Hello?

173
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,542
-Hey, Ma.
-Hi.

174
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,047
No, we're all moved in.

175
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,316
-Yeah, Ma.
-Are you cold?

176
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,390
No, Ma.

177
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,126
Yeah.

178
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,415
-What is it, baby?
-Nothing.

179
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,152
-Are you okay, baby?
-No.

180
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,664
I don't feel well.

181
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,149
-Give me a kiss.
-I can do it, I can do it.

182
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,840
No, you can't.

183
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,148
Come here, come here.

184
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,890
Honey, I'm gonna
make you some tea.

185
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,559
How many brothers and sisters
do you have?

186
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,272
-Chelsea?
-Hey, Mommy.

187
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,706
Hi, hon. Who are you talking to?

188
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:36,439
-The girl who Iives in my closet.
-Oh, yeah?

189
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,913
-And what's her name?
-Jodie.

190
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:43,445
You know there are plenty of other
Iittle girls to play with in town too?

191
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,852
I know, but Jodie says
they're all mean.

192
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,255
Is that Jodie?

193
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,424
No, that's someone else.

194
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,093
Who?

195
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,001
I'm not supposed to say who.

196
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,367
She says it's an A-hole.

197
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,036
You are not allowed
to say that word.

198
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,429
George, George.

199
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,634
-Look what I found.
-What is that? Where'd you find that?

200
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,034
Harry and I found it.

201
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,307
-Where?
-In the basement.

202
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,436
Not the basement.

203
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,672
My office.

204
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,885
You Iisten to me.
You don't go down there.

205
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,246
Understand?

206
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,626
Guys, would you help me
with the groceries?

207
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,934
Go on, go help your mom.

208
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,772
I'm sorry.

209
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,970
Go on.

210
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,420
-How are you feeling?
-Good, good.

211
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,196
I found a babysitter off a board
at the grocery store.

212
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,596
Billy will Iove that.

213
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,760
How about we call her
the young-adult-sitter?

214
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,704
Where's Chelsea?

215
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,369
Where's Chelsea?

216
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,786
Chelsea?

217
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,659
Chelsea?

218
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,900
Chelsea!

219
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,640
Chelsea.

220
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,299
Hey, give me your hand.

221
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,839
Give me your hand, sweetie.

222
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,414
-Chelsea, go to George.
-Come on. Hey, give me your hand.

223
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,885
What were you thinking?
You could have fallen in the water.

224
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,958
Jodie wanted to see the boat.

225
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,189
Somebody should have been
watching you.

226
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,190
Billy, get up.

227
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,320
Billy, I gotta go pee.

228
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,403
Chelsea.

229
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,778
Goddamn it, Harry.

230
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,720
Seriously. You trying to kill me?

231
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,614
Come on, get away from there.

232
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,622
Hey, that's enough.

233
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,755
Hey!

234
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,872
George? Hon, what are you
doing down here?

235
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:27,007
It's the only place
that's warm in this damn house.

236
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,306
Somebody keeps opening
the windows.

237
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,648
What is that?

238
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,490
You tell me.

239
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,928
-Why don't you come back to bed.
-No, I can't sleep.

240
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,757
I'm sorry, baby.

241
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,728
Don't....

242
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,630
Don't talk to me Iike
I'm one of your kids, okay?

243
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,363
-What?
-That goddamn dog woke me up.

244
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,737
Billy's dog.

245
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,144
Found him in the boathouse.

246
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,938
-But you Iocked it.
-Yeah.

247
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,676
Hey, and guess
what I found in Billy's room.

248
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,087
You ready to talk
about those keys?

249
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,460
There's not a Iot in this world can't
be solved with an apology, Billy.

250
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,033
I'm not apologizing
for something I didn't do...

251
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,499
...George.

252
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,874
Get to work, buddy.

253
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,044
"Get to work, buddy."

254
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,544
"Katch 'em...."

255
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,386
George?

256
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,756
George?

257
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,486
George, you down there?

258
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:27,965
George?

259
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,730
What?

260
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,393
What's the matter?

261
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,839
Did you do that thing
with the magnets?

262
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,579
Nothing. Just seeing things,
I guess.

263
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,276
You Iook hideous.

264
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:20,042
You're rather repulsive yourself,
Mr. Lutz.

265
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,709
-Where's the babysitter?
-Babysitter?

266
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,684
Told you guys,
I don't need a babysitter.

267
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,983
- I'm old enough.
-Baby, I know you can--

268
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:31,094
I'm not Ietting her watch us. She's
not coming in, I won't Iet her. I won't.

269
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,697
-She's not coming in.
-Billy, Iisten to me.

270
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:37,028
-I won't Ieave you alone.
-I can't believe you hired a babysitter.

271
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,794
-I told you I was old enough.
-Hi.

272
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,666
-I'm Lisa, the babysitter.
-Great.

273
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,207
Can I take your coat?

274
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,067
Okay.

275
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,775
Hi.

276
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:52,911
I'm Billy.

277
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,155
You sure you don't want
a babysitter?

278
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,387
Would you Iike me
to show you around?

279
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:08,862
No, it's okay.

280
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,695
I know it already.
I used to sit for the Defeos.

281
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,840
Kind of freaky being back here.

282
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,868
I'm Billy.

283
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,012
Yeah, I got you the first time.

284
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,941
Have a good night, Billy.

285
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,082
This is just what we needed,
don't you think?

286
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,922
Yeah. Definitely.

287
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,030
You feeling all right?

288
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:41,923
You know what?

289
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,931
I feel better.

290
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,371
I think I just needed
to get out of the house.

291
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,301
Come on, drink up.

292
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,408
Are you trying
to get me drunk, Mr. Lutz?

293
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,807
That's the appeal of marriage, hon.

294
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,776
Hopefully, I won't have to.

295
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,985
Be right out.

296
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,296
Hungry?

297
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,430
Kid, you read my mind.

298
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,235
The kids, they're--

299
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,569
They're going through
a tough time.

300
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,109
I guess they're just
adjusting to everything.

301
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,304
Yeah, well, we all are.

302
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,117
Do you feel different?

303
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,248
What do you mean?

304
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,186
About us.

305
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,726
About me.

306
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,626
Yeah.

307
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,028
Yeah, I do.

308
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:56,133
I feel Iike for the first time in my Iife,
I'm sure about something.

309
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,839
And that's you.

310
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,806
And I'm gonna spend the rest
of my Iife making you happy.

311
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,416
Oh, boy, you know how
to turn on that Lutz charm.

312
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,687
Some people say his tongue is fake.

313
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,559
I think it's all him.

314
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,504
Got this at a pinball arcade.

315
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,398
Cool.

316
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,809
So do you French?

317
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,939
Do I what?

318
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,676
Kissing, tongues.

319
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,281
No.

320
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:48,116
Did your family know the Defeos?

321
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,692
-The who?
-The family that Iived here before you.

322
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,826
No, we just moved here.

323
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,398
Well, you know what
happened to them, don't you?

324
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:01,802
No.

325
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,668
I really shouldn't be telling you this.

326
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,869
Your parents are gonna be pissed.

327
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,343
It's okay.

328
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,253
Stop. That's not how you play.

329
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:23,884
-I can't hear you.
-Stop it. Let me try.

330
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,092
You're killing him.

331
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,958
So this wack job, Ronnie,
the guy that Iived here.

332
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,739
People in this town say
he heard voices telling him to do it.

333
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:40,207
The guy was a nut. I mean, first
he thinks his dog's out to get him.

334
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,743
So he kills it.

335
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,609
A few days Iater, he thinks his family
is a bunch of demons.

336
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,642
So you know what he did?

337
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,283
Wasted them.

338
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,285
How did he do it?

339
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,559
Do what?

340
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,287
You are way too young to hear this.

341
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,557
So cover your ears.

342
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,459
And don't Iisten.

343
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,397
A rifle.

344
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,971
He went room to room,
splattering their heads as they slept.

345
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,341
He killed his brothers
in this very room.

346
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,679
Right here.

347
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,710
In these beds.

348
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:33,192
It's kind of gross
you guys still sleep in here.

349
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,601
Actually, it's fucking sick.

350
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,468
Yeah.

351
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,668
I'm totally freaking you out, kid.

352
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,876
I suck at babysitting.

353
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:56,519
This was the Iittle brat's room.

354
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,989
Jodie's.

355
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,357
You know, they found her in there.

356
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,688
-Jodie says you're a bad babysitter.
-Yeah?

357
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,229
Well, Jodie's--
What's the word? Dead.

358
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,359
Is not.

359
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,232
That Iittle shit got me fired.

360
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,871
Dare you to go in there.

361
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,837
You give me your Kiss poster
if I do it?

362
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,517
Okay.

363
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,181
Okay.

364
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,686
You're going to make her mad.

365
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,564
Come on, guys.

366
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,230
Ha-ha, guys, this isn't funny.

367
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,840
Billy, Michael.

368
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,273
It's not opening. I can't open it.

369
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,380
-Unlock the fucking door.
-There's no Iock.

370
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,277
This isn't funny. Let me the fuck out.

371
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,441
Billy, Michael.

372
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,611
Let me out. Let me out of here.

373
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,951
Let me out of here!

374
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,093
What's going on?

375
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,827
Let me out.

376
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,692
Hi, Lisa.

377
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,098
Look what Ronnie did.

378
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,287
Let me out!

379
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,962
Let me out of here!

380
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,465
Let me out!

381
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,067
Help me. Let me out!

382
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,303
I saw Jodie.

383
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,778
I saw Jodie.

384
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,473
Who's Jodie?

385
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,776
The Iittle girl.

386
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,149
She's dead.

387
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,655
She's supposed to be dead.

388
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,890
-It's one thing to pull a prank.
-We didn't pull a prank.

389
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,536
-It's another one to hurt someone.
-It was this house.

390
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,399
Shut up!

391
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,366
-George.
-I got this under control.

392
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,340
You don't have you under control.

393
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,212
What you guys did was wrong.

394
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,942
Stop it, Kathy.
Whatever you're doing...

395
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,053
...whatever you're saying
doesn't work.

396
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:48,148
From now on, I'm doing the
disciplining around here, end of story.

397
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,619
This house is bad, Mommy.

398
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,718
Michael, honey.

399
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,832
There's no bad houses.
There's just bad people.

400
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,630
Why didn't you tell us
about the people who died here?

401
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,074
-Where did you hear that?
-The babysitter told me...

402
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:10,543
...that two Iittle boys died
in our room.

403
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,312
Goddamn babysitter's an idiot.

404
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,185
Get to bed. We'II deal with this
in the morning.

405
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,590
No, I'm not sleeping in that room.
It's gross.

406
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,128
-Me neither.
-Wipe that stupid Iook off your face...

407
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,788
...and go to bed.

408
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,528
Run.

409
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,388
Why all the yelling, Mommy?

410
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:03,360
It's nothing. It's over now, baby.

411
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:09,036
I need you to tell me
what happened with Lisa, honey.

412
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,073
Lisa was being mean to Jodie.

413
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,642
So Jodie hurt her.

414
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,573
-Jodie.
-It's okay, Mommy.

415
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,449
Jodie won't hurt you.

416
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,749
She thinks you're a good mommy.

417
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,954
But the man who Iives here...

418
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,654
...she says he's bad.

419
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,359
She wants him to go away.

420
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:38,157
He makes her do bad things.

421
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,574
Move it...

422
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,644
...from there to there.

423
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,144
Go.

424
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,652
And, Billy, don't come in
until you're finished.

425
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:38,885
What?

426
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,797
Is this discipline or torture?

427
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,128
Thought it was meat Ioaf.

428
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,172
When the body suffers,
the spirit flowers.

429
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,573
It's what my dad taught me.

430
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:01,115
His dad's not around
to teach him that, now, is he?

431
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:15,053
Billy, why is George such a jerk?

432
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:19,032
He's not a jerk. He's a douche bag.

433
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,495
And a weirdo.

434
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,538
And a doofus and a dipstick.

435
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,869
Catch them.

436
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,035
Kill them.

437
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,107
Catch them.

438
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,617
Kill them.

439
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,622
Catch them. Kill them.

440
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,333
Catch them.

441
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,401
Kill them.

442
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,477
Kill them.

443
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,958
-No! No!
-Look at me.

444
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,432
-No!
-What's the matter?

445
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,096
-God!
-It's me.

446
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,399
-It's me.
-God!

447
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,077
Baby, it's all right.

448
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,288
Do you use narcotics, Mr. Lutz?

449
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,652
No. But after this week,
I'm gonna give it...

450
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,657
...some serious thought.

451
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,589
Suffer from headaches, nausea?

452
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:07,601
Actually, I feel great now.

453
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,333
Weird as that may sound.

454
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,207
Well, there's no sign
of a concussion.

455
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,005
No sign of any bruising at all.

456
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,740
I want you to give Dr. Stone a call.

457
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:25,983
Wait, wait, wait.
This is a psychiatrist.

458
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,182
-Do I Iook nuts to you?
-I'm not trying to offend you here.

459
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,793
I'm just trying to help you
figure out the problem.

460
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:41,934
I feel Iike it's my fault, George.

461
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,199
-Kath.
-I was the one who wanted this place.

462
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,740
-I put too much pressure on you.
-This is the Iife...

463
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,434
...that I want too, okay?

464
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,273
We got the old American dream here.

465
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,576
Okay? There's no way in hell...

466
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,687
...that I'm Ietting that get away now.

467
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,820
I Iove you, George.

468
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,826
Billy, can I get my teddy?

469
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,970
She's real hungry.

470
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:17,164
Okay, go. And hurry up.

471
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,105
Mom finds out I Iet you out
of my sight, she's gonna kill me.
