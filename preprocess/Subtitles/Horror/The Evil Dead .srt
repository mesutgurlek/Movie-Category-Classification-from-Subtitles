1
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:20,297
Hey Ash, where are we?

2
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:22,569
Well, we just crossed the Tennessee Border.

3
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:29,418
Which would put us...

4
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:31,754
Yeeeah?

5
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,507
Which would put us...

6
00:01:42,797 --> 00:01:45,069
Right... Here.

7
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:57,870
What the hell was that?  Are you trying to kill us?

8
00:01:58,222 --> 00:01:59,886
Hey!  Don't blame me!  It's your steering wheel!  Damn thing jerked

9
00:02:00,815 --> 00:02:02,447
right out of my hands.

10
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:04,687
I don't understand it.  I had this thing in for a tune-up yesterday

11
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:05,807
and they said they'd go over everything.

12
00:02:06,063 --> 00:02:07,727
Yeah!  Well you better take it back because the damn thing don't

13
00:02:08,432 --> 00:02:10,064
work.  The one thing that does work is this lousy horn.

14
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:15,889
Ah!  Go to hell!  I'm not honking at you!

15
00:02:19,537 --> 00:02:20,657
Jesus Christ.

16
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,409
Hey Scotty!  What's this place like anyway?

17
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:26,834
Well, the guy that's renting it says it's an old place.  Little run

18
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:29,202
down, but it's right up in the mountains.  Yeah, and the best part

19
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:32,786
is that we get it so cheap.

20
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:34,707
Yeah, why are we getting it so cheap?

21
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,139
Well, I don't know.  Might be in real bad shape.

22
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,307
You mean, nobody's seen this place yet?

23
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:42,100
Well, not yet.

24
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:43,893
Well, it might not be that bad.

25
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:44,660
No.

26
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:46,133
Actually, it might be kind of nice.

27
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:47,317
Yeah.

28
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:49,269
It's probably a real pit.

29
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:52,310
Ya, I think this is where we get off.

30
00:02:57,623 --> 00:02:59,222
This is the bridge we're going to cross?

31
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:01,720
Jesus Christ!  The whole thing's falling apart on us!

32
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:06,329
Don't let the noise fool you girls, this thing is solid as a rock.

33
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:18,123
It's supposed to be one of these on here.

34
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,500
Will you stop it?

35
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,461
I would very much like to make a toast for all this evening.

36
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:22,447
"Ah, as a great friend of mine once said, he said, ""I..."" Oh Ok Ok"

37
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:28,304
"""??This miss tu tarine??""."

38
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:31,280
Which means?

39
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:33,072
Party down!  Ya!

40
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,052
What is this?

41
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,028
Whatever it is, it's still down there.

42
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:04,629
I don't like cellars.  Let's just close it up.  It's probably just

43
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:05,781
some animal.

44
00:10:06,838 --> 00:10:12,214
An animal?  An animal?    That is the stupidest thing I

45
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:14,615
ever heard of.  Jesus Christ.

46
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:16,599
There's something down there.

47
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:21,303
Maybe it is just some animal.

48
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:26,040
Yeah, you're probably right.  Probably just some animal.  Here

49
00:10:26,297 --> 00:10:27,640
Cheryl, why don't you go down 'n check, make sure?

50
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:29,433
Scotty!  I'm not going down there!

51
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,376
Ok, Ok you cowards, I'll go.

52
00:10:34,362 --> 00:10:35,034
Be careful.

53
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,826
Back in a minute.

54
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:20,064
Hey Scotty!  You find anything?  Scotty.  Scotty!  Scott!

55
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:28,898
He's just kidding around...  Isn't he?

56
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:35,171
Scotty!!  Scott!  Linda, get me a flashlight.

57
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:37,507
That's the only one we brought up.

58
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:39,235
Then get the lantern.

59
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:13,914
Boo!!  Hahahahahah  Hey, come here, I wanna show you

60
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:30,589
something.  Look at all this stuff.  I bet this still shoots.

61
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:31,260
Probably does.

62
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:46,142
Oh God.  Look at this.

63
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:15,938
Look at this.    This kind of looks like your

64
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:21,411
old girlfriend.    C'mon, let's take this stuff upstairs.

65
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:25,252
I'll grab the recorder and you get everything else now...

66
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:56,232
Ok, shhhh...  Listen to this.  This is the tape I found downstairs.

67
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:01,898
(On tape)  It has been a number of years since I began excavating

68
00:16:02,154 --> 00:16:06,570
the ruins of Candar with a group of my colleges.  Now my wife and

69
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:09,771
I have retreated to a small cabin in the solitude of these mountains.

70
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:15,211
Here I continued my research undisturbed by the myriad distractions

71
00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:20,652
of modern civilization and far from the groves of academe.  I believe

72
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:25,197
I have made a significant find in the Candarian Ruins.  A volume of

73
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:30,221
Ancient Sumarian burial practices and funerary incantations.  It is

74
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:35,374
"entitled ""Morturom Demonto""- roughly translated, ""Book of the Dead""."

75
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:42,831
The book is bound in human flesh and inked in human blood.  It deals

76
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,089
with demons and demon resurrection and those forces which roam the

77
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,952
forest and dark bowers of man's domain.  The first few pages warn

78
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,665
that these enduring creatures may lie dormant but are never truly

79
00:16:55,857 --> 00:17:00,337
dead.  They may be recalled to active life through the incantations

80
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:04,658
presented in this book.  It is through recitation of these passages

81
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:08,018
that the demons are given license to possess the living.

82
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,532
Hey!  What did you do that for?  It was just getting good!

83
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,036
I just don't want to hear it anymore, that's all.

84
00:17:15,572 --> 00:17:17,684
Ooooooooo

85
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,468
Scotty, c'mon.  Leave her alone, man.

86
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:24,213
Hey, c'mon.  I just want to hear the rest of it.  No big deal.

87
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:47,896
Shut it off!  Shut it off!  Shut it off!!!

88
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,931
Cheryl.  Where're you going?

89
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,811
I can't believe this.  Scott, you knew not to play that!

90
00:18:08,092 --> 00:18:09,916
I mean c'mon, you knew it was upsetting her.  You just don't know

91
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,356
when you're taking something too far.

92
00:18:11,677 --> 00:18:13,789
Hey, don't give me that!  You were playing it too.  You could of shut

93
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:19,518
it off.  I mean big deal!  She's nuts.  I mean it's just a joke,

94
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,902
c'mon!  Jesus Christ.  She acts like she's three years old or

95
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:24,606
something.

96
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:42,144
Listen.  Why don't we stay up for a while and listen to the storm?

97
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,985
All right, yeah.  Let me check on Cheryl first to see if she's Ok.

98
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:48,107
Aha!

99
00:19:50,763 --> 00:19:52,811
Ohh!  Stealing from the blind, hunh?  This is for you.

100
00:20:09,678 --> 00:20:10,638
Ash, how sweet of you.

101
00:20:13,902 --> 00:20:14,990
Would you put it on?

102
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:20,206
Oh yeah, sure.  I was going to give it to you before we came up here,

103
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:25,743
but things got so hectic, this is really the first chance we've had

104
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:27,088
to be alone.  Take a look.

105
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:41,106
Oh Ash!  It's beautiful.  I really love it.  I'll never take it off.

106
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,298
Join us!

107
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:14,848
Is anybody out there?

108
00:23:14,857 --> 00:23:25,706
I know someone's out there.  I heard you.  I heard you in the cellar.

109
00:28:10,868 --> 00:28:12,212
Ashley!!!

110
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:23,221
What the hell happened to you?  What's the matter with you?  Did

111
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:24,725
something in the woods do this to you?

112
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:29,366
No!  It was the woods themselves!  They're alive Ashley!  The trees!

113
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:31,095
They're alive.

114
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:33,302
Ash.  Why don't I take her in the back room so she can lie down.

115
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,528
I'm not lying down!  I want to get out of here.  I want to leave

116
00:28:37,976 --> 00:28:39,927
this place right now.  Right now Ashley!

117
00:28:40,536 --> 00:28:42,776
Wait a minute.  I sure as hell am not leaving any place tonight.

118
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:43,833
Cheryl.

119
00:28:44,025 --> 00:28:44,537
Cheryl.

120
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:46,617
Cheryl, there's nothing out there.  Trees do not attack people.

121
00:28:46,874 --> 00:28:48,986
Ashley!  Will you drive me into town or not?

122
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:53,017
What?  Right now?!  Look, sure, sure, I'll take you into town, but

123
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:54,203
just listen to what you're saying.

124
00:28:54,363 --> 00:28:57,435
I don't care how it sounds.  I wanna get out of this place right

125
00:28:57,595 --> 00:28:58,299
now.

126
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:02,044
Ok, maybe you could stay somewhere in town tonight.

127
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:12,261
I know it's not gonna start.  It's not gonna let us leave.

128
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:06,285
Why are you stopping?

129
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:09,838
Wait here a minute.

130
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:34,161
Do you see something?  Where're you going?  Ashley?    Ashley?

131
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,292
It's not going to let us go!  It's not going to let us go!

132
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:51,709
I told you!  I told you!  It's not going to let us go!  Why won't

133
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:53,181
you listen to me?

134
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:10,911
(On tape)  I know now that my wife has become host to a Candarian

135
00:33:11,137 --> 00:33:14,944
demon.  I fear that the only way to stop those possessed by the

136
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:19,457
spirits of the book is through the act of bodily dismemberment.  I

137
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:23,521
believe now to avoid this horror, but for myself, I have seen the

138
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:27,490
dark shadows moving in the woods and I have no doubt that whatever I

139
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:32,259
have resurrected through this book is sure to come calling... for me.

140
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:36,227
Ok, ah, let me think.  Ummm... It's a seven.

141
00:33:37,156 --> 00:33:37,923
Oh!  What suit?

142
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:40,804
Ahh... diamonds.  N-n-no wait!  Ummm, hearts!

143
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:43,012
Oh My!  It's seven of hearts!  You're right!

144
00:33:43,493 --> 00:33:45,285
Hey Ash!  I guessed the card right!

145
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,300
Yeah... truly amazing Linda.

146
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:50,182
I don't know.  I don't know, but I think it's really some sort of

147
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:52,101
extra sense or something, you know, like ESP.

148
00:33:52,327 --> 00:33:53,350
Ok, try this one.

149
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,046
Ok... It's a seven.

150
00:33:55,591 --> 00:33:56,551
I don't believe it!

151
00:33:56,871 --> 00:34:06,408
... of spades.  Queen of Spades.  Four of Hearts.  Eight of Spades.

152
00:34:07,689 --> 00:34:11,625
Two of Spades.  Jack of Diamonds.  Jack of Clubs!

153
00:34:15,273 --> 00:34:19,465
Why have you disturbed our sleep?  Awakened us from our ancient

154
00:34:19,818 --> 00:34:28,204
slumber?  You will die!  Nightmare is before you.  One by one we will

155
00:34:28,363 --> 00:34:29,675
take you.

156
00:34:42,573 --> 00:34:43,693
What happened to her?

157
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,031
Did you see her eyes?  Oh Ash, I'm scared.  What's wrong with her?

158
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:48,822
Cheryl!  Stop it!

159
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,850
Join us!

160
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:43,751
Ash.  I think we ought to get out of here.

161
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:45,896
Yeah.

162
00:37:48,777 --> 00:37:49,993
We still have a few more hours before morning.

163
00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:51,496
I don't think I can wait that long.

164
00:37:53,257 --> 00:37:58,026
You have to.  We all have to!  And then in the morning, we'll get in

165
00:37:58,218 --> 00:38:01,386
the car, and we'll take the bridge.  And-

166
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:07,595
Why does she keep making those horrible noises?

167
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:08,523
I don't know!

168
00:38:11,244 --> 00:38:19,116
Her eyes!  Her eyes... For God's Sake!  What happened to her eyes?

169
00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:36,271
Everything's going to be all right.

170
00:38:55,475 --> 00:38:57,363
Scotty.  I-I think there's something's out there.

171
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,395
Go to bed, and get some sleep.  Ok?

172
00:40:55,972 --> 00:40:56,707
Shelly?

173
00:42:04,878 --> 00:42:10,382
Thank you.  I don't know what I would have done if I remained on

174
00:42:10,735 --> 00:42:17,680
those hot coals, burning my pretty flesh.  You have pretty skin.

175
00:42:19,408 --> 00:42:20,592
Give it to us.

176
00:42:34,515 --> 00:42:36,435
Join us.  Join us...

177
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:20,842
Hit her!  Hit it!

178
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:13,874
Scott.

179
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:17,171
Yeah?

180
00:46:20,756 --> 00:46:22,164
What are-  What are we going to do?

181
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:26,739
We're going to bury her.

182
00:46:28,629 --> 00:46:31,349
We can't bury Shelly.  She's a- she's a friend of ours.

183
00:46:31,605 --> 00:46:41,014
Yeah, she's dead.  Shelly's dead.  We gotta bury her now.

184
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:41,438
Linda's still sleeping.  I think once her leg-

185
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,007
I'm getting out of here.

186
00:47:43,232 --> 00:47:46,208
Scott, we can't take Linda anywhere with her leg like that.  We don't

187
00:47:46,368 --> 00:47:48,224
even know if there is anyway back besides the bridge.

188
00:47:49,184 --> 00:47:51,808
Maybe there's a hiking trail, or an old road or some other way around

189
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:56,353
the cliff.  I mean there's gotta be another way besides the bridge.

190
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,738
Listen to me.  Linda cannot walk with her leg like that.  She can't

191
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:01,793
even stand up.

192
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:05,666
Well, then we'll leave her here.  Until we can send somebody back.

193
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:07,202
What?  Are you crazy?

194
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:12,515
Look!  I'm getting out!  I don't care what happens to her.  She's

195
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,876
your girlfriend, you take care of her.  I'm getting the hell out of

196
00:48:16,068 --> 00:48:17,315
here.  Right now.

197
00:48:37,287 --> 00:48:41,191
Soon all of you will be like me.  And then we'll lock you up in the

198
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:44,648
cellar.  Hahahahaha

199
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:35,183
Ash!  Ash!

200
00:49:35,952 --> 00:49:36,751
Oh My God!

201
00:49:37,424 --> 00:49:38,768
Help me!

202
00:49:50,258 --> 00:49:53,746
Scotty.  You're going to be Ok.  You're going to be just fine.

203
00:49:54,227 --> 00:49:55,218
You'll see.

204
00:50:06,484 --> 00:50:11,892
Ash.  It's not going to let us leave.  Cheryl-  Cheryl was right,

205
00:50:13,942 --> 00:50:15,157
we're all going to die here!

206
00:50:15,734 --> 00:50:16,950
No, we're not going to die.

207
00:50:17,238 --> 00:50:18,710
We're all going to die.  All of us!

208
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:23,606
No, we're not going to die!  We're not going to die!  We're gonna

209
00:50:23,798 --> 00:50:27,831
get out of here.  Now listen to me Scotty.  Is there a way around the

210
00:50:28,088 --> 00:50:34,008
bridge?  Scotty!  Listen to me please for God's Sake!  Scott!!

211
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:42,649
Ash.  Ash.  I don't wanna die.  You're not going to leave me are you

212
00:50:43,578 --> 00:50:44,602
Ash?  Are you?

213
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,226
I don't wanna die.  You're not going to leave me here are

214
00:50:47,483 --> 00:50:49,723
you?  Are you Ash?  Hahahahaha

215
00:50:52,923 --> 00:50:56,507
Scotty!  Now c'mon listen to me for God's Sake!  Is there a way

216
00:50:56,764 --> 00:50:58,012
around the bridge?

217
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:07,773
There's a way.  The trail.  But the trees Ash.  They know.  Don't

218
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,597
you see Ash?  They're alive!

219
00:51:29,345 --> 00:51:31,905
Shut up will you?  Shut up!

220
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:47,939
Kill her!  Kill her!

221
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,491
Kill her if you can, loverboy.

222
00:51:59,205 --> 00:52:00,388
Now, forgive me Linda.

223
00:52:25,321 --> 00:52:36,138
Oh Ash, help me please!  Ash, help me please Ash.  Oh Ash.  Please

224
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:41,739
don't let them take me away again.  Please.

225
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:44,459
No, I won't.  I won't.  I promise.

226
00:52:46,444 --> 00:52:54,125
Ashley.  Ashley, help me.  Let me out of here.  Ashley?  Ash, help me.

227
00:52:55,117 --> 00:53:00,077
Let me out of here.  I'mI'm all right now, I'm all right now Ashley,

228
00:53:00,686 --> 00:53:05,711
I'm all right.  Unlock this chain and let me out.

229
00:53:13,712 --> 00:53:15,248
Cheryl?  Cheryl?

230
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:57,302
I'm all right now Ashley!  Come unlock the chain and let

231
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:04,855
me out!  Hahaha  I'm all right now.  It's your sister, Cheryl.

232
00:54:12,569 --> 00:54:15,864
Ah you bastards!  Why are you torturing me like this?  Why?

233
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:28,058
Shut up!

234
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:32,795
We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.

235
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:42,492
Not another peep.  Time to go to sleep.  We-ahhahahahaha

236
00:54:49,182 --> 00:54:53,855
Useless!  Useless!  In time it will come for him and then it will

237
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:55,583
come for you!

238
00:55:19,458 --> 00:55:25,283
Here.  Here.    Now, the sun will be

239
00:55:25,571 --> 00:55:28,867
up in an hour or so and we can all get out of here together.  You,

240
00:55:29,188 --> 00:55:39,973
me, Linda, Shelly.  Hmm.. Well... not Shelly, she-  We'll all be

241
00:55:40,358 --> 00:55:45,894
going home together.  Wouldn't you like to be going home?  I bet

242
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:50,982
you'd like that, wouldn't you?  Scott?

243
00:56:56,272 --> 00:56:58,224
Join us!  Join us!

244
00:59:19,237 --> 00:59:20,453
Oh Linda...

245
01:05:50,942 --> 01:05:51,742
Back door.

246
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:02,111
Where did I see that box of shells?

247
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:42,766
We're going to get you.  We're going to get you.

248
01:07:43,086 --> 01:07:44,974
Shut up, Linda!  Shut up!

250
01:07:53,329 --> 01:07:54,737

251
01:07:55,056 --> 01:07:57,008

252
01:11:38,737 --> 01:11:41,298
