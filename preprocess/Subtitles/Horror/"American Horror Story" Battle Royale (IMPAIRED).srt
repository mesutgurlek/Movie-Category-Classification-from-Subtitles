I just want to crawl inside
your skins and masturbate.

Got to stay close, man.

178
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:48,389
Thick as thieves.
That's how you get

179
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:50,658
a number-one record--
you make it real.

180
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:53,161
I know how we can get close.

181
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:54,361
Make it real.

182
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:55,863

00:10:02,404 --> 00:10:04,505

(whimpering)

187
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:09,042

Well, almost.

199
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,907
Please call the doctor.
They need help.

200
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:44,611
Not sure what I can do
to help them.

201
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:47,580
They'll be messing themselves
soon enough.

202
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:48,615
I'll come back.

203

Please.

Postmortem excrement

205

After that...

221
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:42,513
this was my spot.

222
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,471
It's the only place
I had ever experienced any real

223
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,308
belonging or happiness.

224
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,910
You have serious
abandonment issues.

225
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:58,515
That's why I saved you.

226
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,517
I'm flattered.

227
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,519
Yeah, well,
I don't want you, bitch.

228
00:12:02,553 --> 00:12:05,121
(exhales)

229
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:07,324
I want John.

230
00:12:07,358 --> 00:12:08,958
And he left.

231
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:11,294
With that battle-ax
of a wife

232
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:16,633
and your sweet angel child.

233
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:20,136
I want him back in the hotel
and I want him dead,

234
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,040
here with me,
forever. So...

235
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm gonna need you to do it.

236
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:34,550
Your timing is off.

237
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,354
I'm gonna get you well.

238
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:40,356
I'm gonna bring you blood.

239
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,724
As much as you need.

240
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:43,726
Not human blood.

241
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,229
I need blood like mine.

242
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,698
Would you bring Donovan here?

243
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:51,272
I can feed off him.

244
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:54,936
Just a little bit at a time.

245
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:56,238
Until I'm well.

246
00:12:57,696 --> 00:12:58,807
Donovan is dead.

247
00:12:58,842 --> 00:12:59,842
(chuckles)

248
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:08,716
He was very beautiful.

249
00:13:20,896 --> 00:13:22,430
(door shuts)

250
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:23,931
Do you remember where

251
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:25,266
your room is?

252
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,568
I'll take you.

253
00:13:33,308 --> 00:13:35,943
You want something to eat?

254
00:13:35,977 --> 00:13:37,812
How 'bout some fruit?

255
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,014
It's rotten.

256
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,419
How long has it been
since you were home?

257
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:47,954
Too long.

258
00:13:49,857 --> 00:13:53,860
Now that we have Holden, it's
gonna go back to the way it was.

259
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:57,359
We're gonna be a family again.

260
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:59,866
How are you going to
explain this to Grandma?

261
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:01,367
He looks like a baby.

262
00:14:01,402 --> 00:14:03,369
Holden's supposed to be
my big brother.

263
00:14:03,404 --> 00:14:05,038
Grandma doesn't have to know.

264
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:06,773
This is our secret.

265
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:08,407
As long as we take our medicine,

266
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:10,342
we'll be healthy.

267
00:14:11,344 --> 00:14:13,145
You mean drink blood?

268
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:15,799
Is that what happened to Jasper?

269
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,417
Are you going to eat me, too?
Of course not.

270
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:19,785
You'll always be safe.

271
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,787
How are you going to eat?

272
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:23,322
JOHN:
That's my job.

273
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:24,997
It's nothing
you have to worry about.

274
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:31,764
(panting)

275
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:33,632

276
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:40,104
(panting)

277
00:14:40,138 --> 00:14:42,640
What the hell
are they doing here?

278
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:44,476
You're getting worse.

279
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,644
You're not healing yourself

280
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,012
the way you should be.

281
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:49,747
You said it. You need blood.

282
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,383
Your blood.

283
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:54,385
No.

284
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:56,153
There must be another way.

285
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:58,122
You don't have a lot of options.

286
00:14:58,156 --> 00:14:59,909
And you need a fix.

287
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:01,826
Now.

288
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:03,828
(Countess sobs)

289
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:06,163
(panting)

290
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,967
It'll kill them.

291
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:14,705
I'd rather die.

292
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:21,845
You're not saving anyone.

293
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,715
What do you think's
gonna happen to your children?

294
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:26,717
Hmm?

295
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:30,654
It won't take long for Iris
and Liz to mow them down.

296
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:32,990
(gasps)

297
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:34,991
No!

298
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:37,994
Please. Please, I can't.

299
00:15:38,028 --> 00:15:39,996
I can't!
It's okay, Mommy.

300
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,898
Let us help you.

301
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,810
COUNTESS:
My sweet... my...

302
00:15:58,381 --> 00:16:01,216
Hold on to Mommy.

303
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,052
(crying)

304
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:04,218
No!

305
00:16:04,253 --> 00:16:05,386
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

306
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:06,755
(echoing):
<i>No!</i>

307
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:18,833
You did it.

308
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:21,870
Big hotel.

309
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:23,730
Big furnace.

310
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:30,879
Thank you.

311
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:32,714
(sniffles)

312
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:34,883
I just couldn't have him
going down that chute

313
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:36,384
like so much trash.

314
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:39,887
Of course not.

315
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:42,423
Is there any sign of her?

316
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,461
Not yet. Hopefully she crawled
into some corner and died.

317
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:48,229
It's not likely.

318
00:16:48,263 --> 00:16:50,664
No.

319
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:53,067
Could I have a minute?

320
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:55,002
Oh.

321
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:13,420
(sighs)

322
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:16,156
(sniffles)

323
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,874
Oh, Donovan.

324
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:41,514
Sweet baby.

325
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,951
You did always have
that mean streak.

326
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:46,485
(chuckles, sniffles)

327
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:52,992
I always said that orneriness
came from your father.

328
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:57,063
But that's not so.

329
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:01,433
That was pure me.

330
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:07,206
Oh, we were so much alike.

331
00:18:09,342 --> 00:18:12,178
Maybe that's why
we couldn't be close.

332
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,031
But I did love you.

333
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:24,490
I swear to God I did.

334
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:29,161
(shuddering breath)

335
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:34,166
(sighs)

336
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:52,283
How are you feeling?

337
00:18:56,122 --> 00:18:59,057
Leave me alone.

338
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,074
My goodness,

339
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:13,170
did we have a little accident?

340
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:16,274
I want every speck of him gone.

341

Oh, my.

Who was that?

343
00:19:21,747 --> 00:19:24,115
My son.

344
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:30,355
Would you like him
back in the can?

345
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:32,223
No.

346
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:35,960
Use the vacuum.

347
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:39,297
Where's the bag?

348
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:41,732
It's bagless.

349
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:44,235
(chuckles)

350
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:48,139

all scooped up in a jiffy!

We can't go back now.
We didn't kill her.

We'll never get another

you let her out of that cage.

359

Ramona and I go way back.

We'll just point her in
the direction of the Countess

368
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:24,296

- Oh, God!

Not another step!

389

either of those things at me!

So...

the Countess sent <i>you</i> here

393

to finish me off.

394

Since when are you working
with the Countess?

No, no, no, no.

399

We're all working
against the Countess.

Not that one.

401
00:23:16,473 --> 00:23:19,074
Bitch put me in that hole

405
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:28,049
- Told you.
- No.

406
00:23:28,084 --> 00:23:29,334
We need her.

407
00:23:29,454 --> 00:23:31,953
We need all of us
if we're going to end

408
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:33,455
the Countess's grip
on this place,

409
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,657
her grip on all of us.
Please,

410
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:38,126
- sweetheart.
- Don't you "sweetheart" me.

411
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,495
I have been scratched at,
conked out,

412
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:42,497

LIZ:
Ramona...

416
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:49,637
I should have listened to you
about the Countess,

417
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:52,083
but I was a love-addled idiot,

418
00:23:52,203 --> 00:23:54,575
so, please... forgive me.

419
00:23:57,912 --> 00:23:59,380
I feel you.

420
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:03,618
But I'm just not feeling
like myself right now.

421
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,154
I fed...

422
00:24:06,188 --> 00:24:09,823
but something
not agreein' with me.

423
00:24:09,858 --> 00:24:12,092
Oh. Oh, but we can fix that.

424
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:13,960
- Oh, yeah.
- I have...

425
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,762
some of the Countess's
purified stash

426
00:24:15,796 --> 00:24:17,096
up at the lounge.

427
00:24:17,131 --> 00:24:19,633
I don't need any
of her baby aspirin.

428
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,301
I need to take a life

429
00:24:21,335 --> 00:24:23,436
to bring me back to life!

430

Hey, either of y'all work here?

Queenie.

Oh, yes, I have you.

you to L.A.?

Drew Carey.

Yeah.

Well, I hope you

453
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:22,994
get called to
"come on down!"

454

455
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,663
That's actually guaranteed.

Between you and me,

457
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:29,234
my Supreme did
a little somethin'-somethin'

458

it's enchanted.

460
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:34,672
I thought you looked familiar!

461
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:36,374
I saw you...

462
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:38,909
I saw you on CNN!

Oh, my God.

Oh! It's this
amazing story.

467
00:25:44,783 --> 00:25:46,417
There's a whole gaggle of them.

468
00:25:46,452 --> 00:25:47,952
They're a bona fide coven.

469
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:50,421
They wear chic black,
and they do spells...

470
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:53,057
Oh, my goodness! I hope
you didn't have to marry Satan

471
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:54,325
or anything to join.

472
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,217
That's actually ignorant
and offensive.

473
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:57,582
We're born that way.

474
00:25:57,702 --> 00:25:59,663
We'll all part
of an ancient bloodline.

475
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:01,064
Blood?

476
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:02,366
Really?

IRIS:
That's fascinating.

478
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:06,403
Liz, why don't you go upstairs

479
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:09,172
and make sure
she has everything in her room

480
00:26:09,206 --> 00:26:10,840
she'll need during her stay.

481
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,009
Oh. Of course.

482
00:26:13,043 --> 00:26:15,245
I'll get right on that.

483

Ooh.

00:26:26,757 --> 00:26:29,058
There's a lot of bad juju
in this room.

Oh, that's... the

Meanwhile, you can freshen up.

Bitch, when's the last time
you saw a dermatologist?

506
00:27:30,152 --> 00:27:32,987
Okay, you are obviously trippin'.
What do you want?

507
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:34,656
(deep voice):
Blood.

508
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:39,293
(gasping)

509
00:27:39,328 --> 00:27:40,962
(laughs quietly)

510
00:27:40,996 --> 00:27:44,094
Yeah, you clearly don't know
who you're messing with.

511
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,500
(gasps)

512
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:47,969
(grunts)

513
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:48,970
(gasps)

514
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:49,971
That's right--

515
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:51,672
I'm a human voodoo doll, bitch.

516
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:54,242
Any hurt on me gonna go
right back to you!

517
00:27:54,276 --> 00:27:56,944
You're a damn witch!

518
00:27:56,979 --> 00:27:59,180
Witch's blood
will make me strong.

519
00:27:59,214 --> 00:28:01,448
I ain't nobody's
protein shake, bitch!

520
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:03,550
(screams, gasps)

521
00:28:05,487 --> 00:28:07,788
(gasps, yells)

522
00:28:07,822 --> 00:28:09,656
(grunting, gasping)

523
00:28:14,729 --> 00:28:15,729
That's all you got?

524
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:18,799
Nothing?

525
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:20,333
(panting)

526
00:28:20,368 --> 00:28:23,272
I'm not letting
some raggedy-ass,

527
00:28:23,392 --> 00:28:25,672
red-dotted, blood-whore freak

528
00:28:25,707 --> 00:28:27,841
take up another
second of my time.

529
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:29,877
It's my vacation, bitch!

530
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:32,413
<i>The Price Is Right</i> is waitin'.

531
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:33,679
Come on down!

532
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:35,403
- (yells)
- (gasps)

533
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:37,550
Why aren't you... (gasps)

534
00:28:38,754 --> 00:28:41,186
Your magic has
nowhere to go, my dear.

535
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:44,056
You see, I'm not alive.

536
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:46,191
You may be a witch...

537
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,346
(Ramona grunts, growls)

538
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:49,128
...but I am a ghost.

539
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:51,597
(sighs)

540
00:28:51,632 --> 00:28:53,265
Ooh.

541
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,534
A shame she had to die.

542
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:56,802
(chomping, sucking)

543
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:59,151
This one had a flair
for the dark arts.

544
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:02,574
(gasping)

545
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,845
Who the hell are you?

546
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,580
James Patrick March.

547
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:13,351
You saved me for a reason.

548
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:16,054
I need you to kill the Countess.

549
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,765
Looks to me
you qualify for the job.

550
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:22,861
And ruin my one chance
for happiness? Oh, no.

551
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:26,300
She must die in this hotel, but she can't
suspect I had anything to do with it.

552
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,266
You're the only one
strong enough.

553
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,069
Then she'll be bound
to the Cortez.

554
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,104
She's on the verge
of absconding forever,

555
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,039
and I will not allow it.

556
00:29:35,074 --> 00:29:36,433
Drink up, darling.

557
00:29:36,768 --> 00:29:39,027
You're going to need
your strength.

558
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,648
(growls quietly)

559
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,267
(muffled grunting)

560
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,502
Do you swear you haven't taken

561
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:06,936
any drugs in the last 30 days?

562
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:07,937
(muffled grunting)

563
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,473
I'm a cop.
I can test you.

564
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,807
Do I have to test you?

565
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:13,510
(muffled grunting)

566
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:26,088
Alex?

567
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,425
Hello?

568
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:39,768
Alex?

569
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:42,771
Scarlett?

570
00:31:05,977 --> 00:31:07,978
(keys jingle, lock clicks)

571
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:16,434
Hello, John.

572
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:17,596
You?

573
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:20,078
What'd you do with my family?

574
00:31:20,198 --> 00:31:21,654
(chuckles):
I didn't do anything.

575
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:23,904
You know I'm trapped here.

576
00:31:24,726 --> 00:31:27,090
And you want nothing more...

577
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:29,360
than for me to be
trapped here with you.

578
00:31:29,394 --> 00:31:32,263
Well, that's right.

579
00:31:32,297 --> 00:31:35,066
And I would've taken a hammer
to the back of your head

580
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,433
the second you walked in, but...

581
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:39,070
he wouldn't let me.

582
00:31:41,139 --> 00:31:43,874
March-- are you saying
he took my family?

583
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:46,442
You made him a promise, John.

584
00:31:46,477 --> 00:31:48,444
Where are they?
One last kill,

585
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:51,381
and then
I can take you to your family.

586
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:53,950
They're safe.

587
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,054
For now.

588
00:31:59,723 --> 00:32:01,858
He's never gonna leave me alone

589
00:32:01,893 --> 00:32:03,500
until I give him what he wants.

590
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,734
"Thou shalt not commit murder."

591
00:32:07,298 --> 00:32:09,299
That's all that's left.

592
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:12,468
I need to find a murderer.

593
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,247
Well, that shouldn't be
too difficult.

594
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,647
LIZ:
Oh.

595
00:32:24,682 --> 00:32:27,417
Damn...!

596
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:29,251
I hate it when a woman

597
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:31,921
looks better in one of
my outfits than I do.

598
00:32:31,955 --> 00:32:34,123
(chuckles):
I know, I <i>know.</i>

599
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:35,658
I ought to be in pictures,

600
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:37,960
'cept I can't be photographed.

601
00:32:37,994 --> 00:32:39,261
Anyways...

602
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:42,932
we have some
accessories for you.

603
00:32:42,966 --> 00:32:44,333
(chuckles)
I don't need

604
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:45,600
any of that.

605
00:32:45,635 --> 00:32:47,937
I got witch's blood in my veins.

606
00:32:47,971 --> 00:32:50,372
Plus, a golden opportunity.

607
00:32:50,406 --> 00:32:52,908
The Countess has never
been more vulnerable.

608
00:32:52,943 --> 00:32:55,644
I don't need any
convincing, sisters.

609
00:32:55,678 --> 00:32:58,580
It's time... for me to rise

610
00:32:58,614 --> 00:33:00,149
and her...

611
00:33:00,183 --> 00:33:01,783
to fall.

612
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,541
(grunts)

613
00:33:35,918 --> 00:33:38,353
(liquid pouring)

614
00:33:49,765 --> 00:33:52,867
It's not the Shalimar
that gives you away.

615
00:33:56,372 --> 00:33:57,638
It's your blood.

616
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:00,737
I've never known another woman

617
00:34:00,857 --> 00:34:03,544
whose blood smelled
like walnuts.

618
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:06,818
Yours still smells
like black licorice.

619
00:34:06,938 --> 00:34:10,151
You look incredible.

620
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:11,685
What have you been eating?

621
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,915
I just had me a witch.

622
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:15,856
Really?

623
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:21,829
I feel like grizzly bears
are running through my veins.

624
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:24,197
I feel strong.

625
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:27,000
Strong enough to take me down?

626
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:29,084
(chuckles)

627
00:34:29,204 --> 00:34:33,106
I could have Yogi Bear
running though my veins

628
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:34,942
and I could take you down.

629
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:37,778
And I imagine that locking you
up in that hallway hasn't

630
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:40,113
softened your rage towards me.

631
00:34:40,148 --> 00:34:43,951
I fantasized about coming here
and ending you

632
00:34:43,985 --> 00:34:45,719
every day.

633
00:34:45,754 --> 00:34:47,788
And what did you settle on?

634
00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:51,023
You always did like to...

635
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:52,325
take your time.

636
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:53,993
I haven't decided yet.

637
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:55,695
I've never been one to plan.

638
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:58,531
I prefer improvisation.

639
00:34:59,533 --> 00:35:02,407
I'm weak, but I'm
still the champ.

640
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,105
You may beat me,

641
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,874
but you're not getting out
of here without

642
00:35:07,908 --> 00:35:09,943
at least
a severe, lifelong limp.

643
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,945
You're bullshitting me?

644
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:16,215
I think everyone
in the world thinks

645
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:18,084
they're either blessed
or cursed.

646
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:22,054
(scoffing laugh)

647
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:24,290
I've come to realize
that I'm neither.

648
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:30,896
I am a curse.

649
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,266
Nobody that gets within
ten feet of me survives.

650
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:39,505
And God help you if you get

651
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:41,507
right up close, skin to skin.

652
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:43,509
Then you're really screwed.

653
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:45,811
You're trying
to make me feel sorry for you?

654
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:47,546
I'm trying to apologize.

655
00:35:48,681 --> 00:35:49,781
(exhales)

656
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,217
I'm not used to this.

657
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:53,419
Cut me some slack, bitch.

658
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,727
What if I gave you the hotel?

659
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:06,964
Hah. Severance pay
for 20 years of hell?

660
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:11,676
I liked staying here
because it made me feel safe.

661
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:16,674
But I see now that it's just
because I was so comfortable

662
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,444
living in heartbreak.

663
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:21,646
I don't want to be here anymore.

664
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:27,618
It's harder to kill you

665
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:29,787
when I'm sitting
in the same room as you.

666
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:33,957
Easier to carve your heart out
of your chest and eat it

667
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,960
when you're just a monster
in my mind.

668
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,796
That sounds
like a dream way to die.

669
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,831
So erotic.

670
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,847
I want to go.

671
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,384
Just me and my baby boy.

672
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,654
Okay... kill me.

673
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:08,834
But screw me first.

674
00:37:08,954 --> 00:37:10,526
♪ You adore me

675
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:14,997
♪ You adore me

676
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:17,967
♪ You adore me

677
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:22,171
♪ I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna be adored ♪

678
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:26,175
♪ I wanna,
I wanna, I wanna be adored ♪

679
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,513
♪ I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna be adored ♪

680
00:37:30,547 --> 00:37:32,348
♪ I wanna, I wanna

681
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:35,283
(elevator bell dings)
♪ I gotta be adored...

682
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:48,764
♪

683
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:56,538
♪ I wanna be adored.

684
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:11,908
Give yourself a smile, John.

685
00:38:12,028 --> 00:38:13,855
Ten Commandments.

686
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:16,390
Each victim a worthy
representative of their sin.

687
00:38:16,424 --> 00:38:20,695
And the last one:
Thou shalt not commit murder.

688
00:38:20,729 --> 00:38:23,064
I suppose you or I could
be sitting on that shelf,

689
00:38:23,098 --> 00:38:26,067
but your choice was inspired.

690
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:29,737
Couldn't have worked out any
better if I had planned it myself.

691
00:38:29,772 --> 00:38:32,439
Aren't you proud
of our boy, Sally?

692
00:38:32,474 --> 00:38:34,608
I always knew he was the one.

693
00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:36,950
How do you feel, John?

694
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,746
- It must be exhilarating.
- Yeah.

695
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:41,615
MARCH: A true sense
of completeness.

696
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,584
I'm completely done.

697
00:38:43,618 --> 00:38:45,986
MARCH: No!
(grunting)

698
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,622
MARCH: No!
He belongs with me!

699
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:50,523
No! I need him alive.
Out in the world.

700
00:38:50,558 --> 00:38:52,525
There's more at stake here
than your womanly desires.

701
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,227
I have great plans for this one.

702
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:56,196
- (grunts) - Stop now before
my addiction demon

703
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,530
becomes your constant companion!

704
00:38:57,565 --> 00:38:58,932
No more plans.

705
00:38:58,966 --> 00:39:01,267
(panting)
Take me to my family.

706
00:39:01,302 --> 00:39:03,770
- John... John!
- Please!

707
00:39:18,541 --> 00:39:20,541
Do you remember
the first time, Miss Evers?

708
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:26,020
When I had intimacies
with the opposite sex?

709
00:39:26,256 --> 00:39:28,849
The first time you realized
you were a ghost.

710
00:39:29,317 --> 00:39:34,421
Oh! Well, I was very
frightened and confused,

711
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,724
but I had you to steady my hand.

712
00:39:36,758 --> 00:39:38,559
You were my rock, Mr. March.

713
00:39:38,594 --> 00:39:39,727
Yes, yes.

714
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:42,296
The Countess
will be similarly unmoored.

715
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,390
It's up to us
to provide that ballast.

716
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,300
I want everything to be perfect.

717
00:39:46,334 --> 00:39:47,635
What's for dinner?

718
00:39:47,669 --> 00:39:49,303
Chipped beef on toast.

719
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,772
To serve my queen?!

720
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,440
This is an outrage!

721
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:55,942
(doorbell rings)

722
00:40:08,556 --> 00:40:11,190
Darling, you look
ravishing. Come in.

723
00:40:11,225 --> 00:40:12,826
Take my hand.

724
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,794
It'll take some time
to acclimate yourself

725
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,030
to your new state.

726
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:21,367
How do you feel?

727
00:40:21,402 --> 00:40:23,703
There's no pain but...

728
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:26,305
no passion.

729
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,307
No passion, no fire.

730
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,476
The passion was
in front of your nose,

731
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,046
if only you'd opened
your eyes to see it.

732
00:40:35,863 --> 00:40:38,418
At least I don't have
to spend an eternity

733
00:40:38,452 --> 00:40:40,753
as a pear-shaped frump.

734
00:40:40,787 --> 00:40:42,755
MARCH:
(chuckles) Well!

735
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:46,459
Yes. Uh... you'll find

736
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:48,961
some frustrations, no doubt,
as you adjust to the vicissitude

737
00:40:48,995 --> 00:40:51,464
of your new life.
The inability

738
00:40:51,498 --> 00:40:54,467
to step outside the confines
of this hotel, for one.

739
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:57,870
But there is no profit
accentuating the limitations.

740
00:40:57,904 --> 00:41:00,673
On the balance, we are blessed.

741
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:02,975
We are together again, my love.

742
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:05,010
That one fact erases
a multitude of sins.

743
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:09,068
I can finally forgive you for
turning me in to the police.

744
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,551
I didn't turn you in.

745
00:41:14,188 --> 00:41:17,856
There is no need for any
further prevarication, darling.

746
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:20,893
We are reduced to our essence.

747
00:41:21,895 --> 00:41:24,362
I'm not lying.

748
00:41:24,397 --> 00:41:25,731
If I wanted you dead,

749
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:27,967
I would have killed you myself.

750
00:41:32,138 --> 00:41:33,939
Then who?

751
00:41:33,974 --> 00:41:35,774
MS. EVERS:
You should've left!

752
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,508
Why didn't you leave?!

753
00:41:39,116 --> 00:41:41,780
I knew
you would eventually get bored.

754
00:41:41,815 --> 00:41:44,783
Why did you have to die here?

755
00:41:44,818 --> 00:41:47,019
It was me.
I did it!

756
00:41:47,053 --> 00:41:48,720
I wanted you for myself!

757
00:41:48,754 --> 00:41:51,723
I left the handkerchief
for the police.

758
00:41:51,757 --> 00:41:53,525
I knew that they would come,

759
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:56,894
and I knew that you would never
allow yourself to be captured.

760
00:41:58,062 --> 00:42:02,046
I wanted us to die together.

761
00:42:04,685 --> 00:42:09,202
So that you can see
the depth of my devotion.

762
00:42:11,577 --> 00:42:14,895
While this one
resented every moment

763
00:42:15,015 --> 00:42:18,150
she was obligated
to be in your presence.

764
00:42:18,184 --> 00:42:21,586
I would happily
stand behind you,

765
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:23,455
waiting to serve,

766
00:42:23,489 --> 00:42:25,923
savoring your every word.

767
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:30,107
Have you seen no evidence
of my love?

768
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:37,434
Do you feel nothing at all?

769
00:42:37,469 --> 00:42:40,672
Can you see me now?

770
00:42:41,674 --> 00:42:45,877
I have laid myself bare.

771
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:49,747
I've dwelt in silence
for so long.

772
00:42:49,782 --> 00:42:51,749
Give me a word, Mr. March.

773
00:42:51,784 --> 00:42:53,679
Let me be happy.

774
00:43:10,968 --> 00:43:12,969
Get out.

775
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,176
You...

776
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:21,610
are banished from my presence.

777
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:36,226
I-I feel...
(shuddering breath)

778
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,161
strangely free.

779
00:43:38,196 --> 00:43:40,030
(sniffles)

780
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:46,603
(low groan)

781
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:49,873
I will no longer wait on you...

782
00:43:51,308 --> 00:43:53,309
...and your whore.

783
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:56,546
COUNTESS:
You have nothing.

784
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,680
What else would you

785
00:43:57,715 --> 00:43:59,515
possibly do?

786
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,554
There are more stains
in heaven and earth

787
00:44:04,588 --> 00:44:07,660
than are dreamt of
in your philosophy.

788
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:21,036
(door opens)

789
00:44:23,073 --> 00:44:24,707
(door shuts)

790
00:44:35,765 --> 00:44:37,093
Mm.

791
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:54,236
A toast.

792
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,209
How thrilled I am
to have you across from me.

793
00:45:00,243 --> 00:45:03,412
Not once a month,
but from now on.

794
00:45:06,944 --> 00:45:10,619
Until the sun falls from the sky

795
00:45:10,653 --> 00:45:14,489
and the heavens burn
in conflagration.

796
00:45:20,993 --> 00:45:22,596
(exhales)

797
00:45:26,802 --> 00:45:37,798
