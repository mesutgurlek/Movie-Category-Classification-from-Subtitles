too long in the tooth.

That was funny.

842
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,754
"Long, tooth."
Funny.

843
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,430
Did I tell you
the one about...

Let's get down to business,
shall we?

848
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,272
I need 12 volunteers.

Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.

01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:12,834
I took it
from the archives.

01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,269
It's written in blood.

855
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,075
It's from
The Book of Erebus.

856
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,629
I think it's what Frost
has been workin' on.

857
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,798
It's somethin'
about the Blood God,

I can't make out
the rest of it.

01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:31,829
Maybe this'll help.

862
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,154
I'll figure out something.

863
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,954
So what's all this?

864
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,470
Took a trip to
the hospital last night,

865

For your
miracle cure?

867
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,076
This is E.D.T.A.

868
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,157
It's an anticoagulant.

869
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,556
We use it
to treat blood clots.

870

Now look what happens
when I introduce it

01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,589
onto a sample
of vampire blood.

I didn't say E.D.T.A.
was a cure.

877
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,639
But maybe
you could use it

878
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,116
to explode
some vampire heads.

879

Why do vampires
need to drink blood?

'Cause their own blood
can't sustain haemoglobin.

Right. So it's

just like
haemolytic anaemia.

that's safe?

a choice, do l?

this could work?

from a bite
like I did.

It's--it's part
of his DNA.

I'm sure I can cure
his thirst,

but it's gonna
take time.

01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:15,835
The disc.

1004
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,269
He decoded it.

1005
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,393
Frost is trying to...

1006
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,150
trigger a fuckin'
vampire apocalypse.

1007
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,111
There's some kind of...

1008
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:32,552
Vampire God he's trying
to resurrect.

1009
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,599
La Magra.

1010
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,512
You're the key.

1011
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,598
He needs
your blood.

1012
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,276
The blood
of the daywalker.

1013
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,314
You're the chosen one.

1014
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:58,954
Listen to me, Blade.

1015
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,919
You can't
go after him.

1016
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,588
Bullshit.

1017
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,792
If Frost gets
his hands on you,

1018
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,549
it's all over.

1019
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,960
There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

1020
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,152
[Groan]

1021
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,555
Shit.

1022
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,631
You're gonna have
to finish me off.

1023
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,231
Don't want me
coming back.

1024
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,917
We can treat
the wounds.

1025
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,879
It's too far gone.

1026
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,356
You know that.

1027
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:42,120
Give me your gun.

1028
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:44,993
No.

1029
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,680
Give me
the god-damn gun.

1030
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,670
Now walk away,

1031
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,315
you stupid
son of a bitch.

1032
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,150
Walk the fuck away.

1033
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,153
[Gun blast]

1034
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,196
By the time you watch this,

1035
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,834
your friend Whistler
should be dead.

1036
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,679
If it makes any
difference to you,

1037
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,314
he put up
quite a fight.

1038
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,320
You can find us
at the Edgewood Towers.

1039
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,510
You seem a bit...

1040
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:28,597
tense.

1041
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,553
A bit pent-up maybe,

1042
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,433
like you need to
release something.

1043
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,117
You know?

1044
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,595
Blade not...

1045
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,990
givin' it to you
maybe.

1046
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,029
I don't know.
I just...

1047
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,351
I see such
a beautiful woman.

1048
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,194
Great skin.

1049
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,518
I'd like to see you
happy, that's all.

1050
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,997
Is this the part where
you offer to turn me?

1051
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,516
Well, it's either that
or a body bag.

1052
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,109
Go ahead.

1053
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,675
Bite me.

1054
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,588
I'll just cure myself.

1055
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:05,950
I did it before,

1056
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,628
and I can do it again.

1057
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,399
There is no cure,
baby.

1058
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,909
There is if you've
been bit,

1059
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,511
if you were once human.

1060
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,669
How'd you get
that scar, Deacon?

1061
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,189
A born vampire

1062
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,870
would have the power
to regenerate from birth.

1063
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,993
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

1064
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:29,350
Isn't that right?

1065
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,678
Vampires like you
aren't a species.

1066
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,714
You're just...infected,
a virus...

1067
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,718
a sexually transmitted
disease.

1068
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,149
I'll tell you
what we are, sister.

1069
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,670
We're the top of
the fuckin' food chain.

1070
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,712
The Blood God's coming.
And after tonight,

1071
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,639
you people
are fuckin' history.

1072
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:48,229
He's a hurricane,

1073
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,238
an act of God.

1074
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,954
Anyone caught
in his path

1075
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,515
will instantly
be turned.

1076
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,588
Everyone you've
ever known,

1077
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,679
everyone you've ever
fucking loved.

1078
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,633
It won't matter
who's pureblood

1079
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,229
and who's not.

1080
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,194
How are you gonna cure
the whole fuckin' world?

1081
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,359
Hmm?

1082
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,557
And Blade's blood
is the key.

1083
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,672
We got an intruder.

1084
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,239
[Elevator bell]

1085
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,433
[Motorcycle engine

1086
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,388
[Revving loudly,
all around]

1087
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,114
[Tyres peeling]

1088
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,390
Deac, I don't think
you understand.

1089
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:46,670
I mean, this dude
is fuckin' bad. What?

1090
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,712
He's, like, he had
20 guys around him--

1091
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,513
and he's got shit
he throws at you--

1092
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,075
Yeah, the swords.

1093
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,396
Throw it in the air,
catch it underneath.

1094
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,034
Yeah. Shut the fuck up!

1095
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,390
[Over radio] There's no
intruder where we are.

1096
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,193
Look, make it happen,
all right?

1097
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,789
It's one guy on foot.

1098
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,918
That's him!
Get him!

1099
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,079
Why am I hearing
gunfire? Huh?

1100
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,750
Did I tell anybody
to start shooting?

1101
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,155
I need him alive.

1102
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,635
No!

1103
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,037
Please!

1104
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,629
I just work for them!

1105
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,279
Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.

1106
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,675
Yes, sir!

1107
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,990
Aah!

1108
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,510
Aieee!
Aah!

1109
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,232
Eric?

1110
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,432
But you died.

1111
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,676
I came back, Eric.

1112
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,348
That very same night...

1113
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,548
when Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

1114
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:55,717
[Shock blast]

1115
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,991
Uhh!

1116
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,235
Jesus Christ. I thought
you'd be happy.

1117
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:08,635
You're finally being
reunited with your mother,

1118
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:10,354
and you act like this?

1119
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,831
Blade, give it up.
It's over.

1120
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,918
She belongs to me,
buddy.

1121
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,315
Uh! Uhh!

1122
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,269
Don't look so surprised.

1123
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:22,119
You spent your whole life

1124
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,835
looking for the vampire
who bit your mother.

1125
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,111
Well, here I am.

1126
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,196
Who would ever guess

1127
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,631
you'd survive
your mother's death?

1128
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:33,956
But you did.

1129
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,549
And here we are--

1130
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,230
one big happy
fuckin' family.

1131
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,832
I need my serum.

1132
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,350
Maybe when we
get outta this,

1133
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,518
I'll take that
miracle cure of yours.

1134
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,439
There's one catch.

1135
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,753
If it works,

1136
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,076
you'll lose
your strength

1137
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:09,308
and your ability
to regenerate.

1138
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:11,671
You'll be
completely human.

1139
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:32,989
Uhh!

1140
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,315
FROST: Blade, Karen,

1141
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,193
glad you could make it.

1142
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:17,835
Hey, man. Thanks
for the shades.

1143
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,116
Our ancestors
called this place

1144
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:23,676
the Temple
of Eternal Night.

1145
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,113
Nice, isn't it?

1146
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,949
Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.

1147
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,630
Fortunately for us...

1148
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,035
I'm what you
might call a...

1149
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,948
student of history.

1150
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,711
Why are we here?

1151
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:58,113
This temple was built
for one glorious moment--

1152
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,711
this night,
for the Blood God.

1153
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:10,869
Thanks.

1154
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,399
Let's see
this sword of yours.

1155
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:21,869
Well.

1156
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:22,991
Titanium, right?

1157
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,351
Acid-etched?

1158
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,719
I'll get used
to a weapon like this.

1159
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:35,751
What?

1160
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,555
You look surprised.

1161
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,149
I told you, Blade,

1162
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,636
I know everything
about you.

1163
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,669
Hold out your arm,
Quinn.

1164
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:45,836
Why, man?

1165
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:46,917
These are--they're,
