We're two members short.

25
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:48,826
Hershel: I think we should make some
new rules before they get back.

26
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:52,413
I hereby declare we have
spaghetti Tuesdays

28
00:02:57,503 --> 00:03:00,288

some spaghetti.

You okay to take over?

30

seconds, squeeze.

You want to help me
go on my rounds?

35
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,230
Yeah.

36
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:36,032
Sure.

37
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:45,056
How long will that
keep him alive?

38
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,979
Just as long
as we're willing to do it.

39
00:03:52,147 --> 00:03:54,566
As long as it takes.

Help me get him on this.

45
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:49,185
Okay, but in a couple
of hours when Henry's dead--

46
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:51,438
- Glenn.
- How are we gonna get his body

down the stairs,
across the cell block

and through those doors
without anyone noticing?

49
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:59,779
If that happens-- if--
you're gonna help me.

50

And what if I'm gone?

51
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:05,524
Shut up and help me

Sawyer" from my room.

read it by tonight.

- I won't finish it.

00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,117
Why?

59

It's gonna get too dark.

Well,

this yet, have you?

64
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:14,368
There was one late last night.

65

Sasha did it.

You didn't have to do anything?

( sniffles )
End stage

168
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:58,080
is a point that no one
comes back from

169
00:13:58,081 --> 00:14:01,056
or they--
or they can't.

170
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:04,896
That's where I am.

171
00:14:04,897 --> 00:14:08,990
No, you need to focus on
the ones that can make it.

172
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,984
I made some more IVs.

173
00:14:14,464 --> 00:14:17,408
If you're not ready
to lose one,

174
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:18,876
you're gonna lose them all.

175
00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:20,769
It's like turning
off a light--

176
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,328
it'll happen one
after the other.

177
00:14:24,224 --> 00:14:26,108
And they don't just die.

178
00:14:26,109 --> 00:14:28,448
We can hold on.

179
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:31,847
Caleb.

180
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:33,920
Caleb.

181
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:36,672
After what happened
in the other cell block,

182
00:14:36,673 --> 00:14:39,521
when I came in here,
I brought these.

183
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:42,624
Get back in bed now.
We're not that bad off.

184
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:47,746
When we are,

185
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:50,272
it'll be too late.

186
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:52,691
You don't understand.

187
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,361
You have a chance.

188
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,079
This is it after this.

189
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,314
I'm not giving up on anyone.

190
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,534
Not yet.

191
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:04,987
Just make sure everyone's
doors are shut.

192
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,269
Caleb...

193
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:14,304
Just make sure!

194
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:16,673
( coughing )

195
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:22,114
Caleb, you've got
to let me look at you.

196
00:15:25,535 --> 00:15:28,192
Okay, Hershel.

197
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,208
Have a look.

198
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:38,806
Drink the tea I left you.

199
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,476
Gonna be back to check
on you in an hour.

200
00:15:41,477 --> 00:15:44,445

204
00:16:24,486 --> 00:16:27,304
Everyone,

205
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:29,524
get back in your cells.

206
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:37,498
Go on, get back in your cells.

207
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:45,423
Let's get him on this.

208

209
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:08,529
( panting )

210
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:13,034
Go rest.

211
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:15,536
Can you make it to your cell?

Rick:
<i>Hershel.</i>

222
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:21,803
Third one we've lost.

223
00:18:21,804 --> 00:18:24,355
We're burning them
behind the blocks.

224
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:26,808
Burning them.

225
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:30,561
That's what it's come to.

226
00:18:32,698 --> 00:18:34,982
Are you okay?

227
00:18:36,535 --> 00:18:39,603
I talked to him yesterday
about Steinbeck.

228
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:42,123
He told me a quote.

229
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:44,876
"A sad soul

230
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:48,246
can kill quicker
than a germ."

231
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:53,951
That's exactly why I didn't want
them all to see what happens.

232
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:58,422
I know they know,

233
00:18:58,423 --> 00:19:01,759
but I didn't want them
to see it right now.

234
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:05,513
They're seeing you, Hershel.

235
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:09,633
They see you

236
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:11,736
keep going.

237
00:19:11,737 --> 00:19:14,906
Even after all the choices
keep getting taken away.

238
00:19:22,414 --> 00:19:25,482
When we get past this thing...

239
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:29,653
it's not gonna be like
how it was, is it?

240
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:32,156
No.

241
00:19:35,827 --> 00:19:39,347
Was that denial?

242
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:41,215
Not seeing things
for how they were?

243
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:43,000
No.

244
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:45,219
You just caught a break.

245
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,890
You needed some time.
You got some.

246
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:51,008
You got lucky.

247
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:53,394
We all did.

248
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:56,781
I still think there's a plan.

249
00:19:57,983 --> 00:20:00,234
I still believe
there's a reason.

250
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:05,289
You think it's all a test?

251
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,293
Life was always a test, Rick.

252
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,468
I need to talk
to you about Carol.

253
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:37,238

Come on.

00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,464
Come on, Sasha.

257
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:07,385
You know how to fight.

258
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,921
<i>Just hold on.</i>

259
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:18,479
<i>Just hold on.</i>
<i>Don't give up on me, now.</i>

260
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:26,335
( growling )

261
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:37,346
I just talked to your dad.

262
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:40,699
He looks good,
all things considered.

263
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,703
If Carl were sick, would
you be up there with him?

264
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,791
If I thought I could help.

265
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:50,592
You don't think I can help?

266
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:57,266
( yelps )

267
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:59,101
- ( grunts )
- Damn.

268
00:22:03,773 --> 00:22:06,141
I'm just glad
you're out here with me.

269
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:21,824
Welcome back.

270
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:25,911
I passed out?

271
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:28,413
You were dehydrated.

272
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,299
Being a hero takes
a lot out of you.

273
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:33,368
You should know.

274
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:39,508
I thought you were an
idiot to come in here.

275
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:41,927
I mean, I was sure
you were just gonna be

276
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:44,513
a dead foolish man.

277
00:22:44,514 --> 00:22:46,848
I can't tell
if that's a compliment.

278
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:49,434
I don't know what I'm saying.

279
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,554
I must have hit my head.

280
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:00,912
I don't believe in magic

281
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,115
or luck.

282
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,619
I do the math

283
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,088
and I don't gamble.

284
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:15,260
But I don't know
if I'd be here right now

285
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:18,130
if you weren't so damn stupid.

286
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:20,432
You know what?

287
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:23,385
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

288
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:31,560

289

I'll check on you
in a little while.

295
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:33,371
How is he?

296
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,123
He's sleeping.

297
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:37,793
You should get
some rest yourself.

298
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:41,513
I don't want to leave him
in case he wakes up.

( rattling )

300
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,968
- Want me to take a look at him?
- No.

301
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:50,055
Just let him sleep.

Everyone stay in your cells.

No.

The fence is more important.
We need to keep it standing.

00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:35,600
I got this.

Keep following me.
Come here.
