DALLAS: Something has attached
itself to him.

339

We have to get him
to the infirmary right away.

340

What kind of thing?
l need a definition.

341

DALLAS:
An organism. Open the hatch.

Wait a minute.

ASH: l would suggest

378

it's feeding him oxygen.

lf we remove it...

that he's got an outer layer
of protein polysaccharides.

441

He has a funny habit
of shedding his cells...

and replacing them
with polarizzed silicone...

443

a prolonged resistance...

01:14:04,487 --> 01:14:06,455
the third junction,

the matter with that box?

[Beeping]

808
01:14:29,346 --> 01:14:32,008
LAMBERT: Dallas,
hold your position for a minute.

809
01:14:33,817 --> 01:14:34,909
l've lost the signal.

810
01:14:35,785 --> 01:14:37,912
DALLAS: What? You sure?

811
01:14:37,954 --> 01:14:39,581
LAMBERT: Are you sure
that it's not there?

812
01:14:39,622 --> 01:14:41,487
lt's got to be around there
somewhere.

813

DALLAS: Check that out, Lambert.

01:14:47,964 --> 01:14:50,159
You may be getting interference.

LAMBERT: Are you sure
there's no sign of it?

lt is there.

[Muttering] l can't

All right.

Uh, am l clear?
l want to get out of here.

it's moving right towards you!

No, not that way!
The other way, Dallas!

-No!
-Take it easy.

[Static]

834
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:55,620
We found this laying there.

nothing.

How come nobody's
saying nothing?

RlPLEY: l'm thinking.

840
01:16:16,086 --> 01:16:18,646
Unless somebody
has got a better idea...

841
01:16:20,757 --> 01:16:22,520
we'll proceed with Dallas' plan.

What?

843
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:26,421
And end up like the others?

Oh, no,

LAMBERT:
l say that we abandon this ship.

We get the shuttle and
just get the hell out of here!

Lambert, shh.
The shuttle won't take four.

01:16:42,745 --> 01:16:44,372
LAMBERT:
Then why don't we draw straws?

851
01:16:44,414 --> 01:16:45,745
l'm not drawing any straws.

l'm for killing that thing
right now.

RlPLEY: OK.

854
01:16:49,752 --> 01:16:51,549
Well, let's talk about
killing it.

855
01:16:51,588 --> 01:16:53,180
We know
it's using the air shafts.

Listen to me, Parker! Shut up!

-We don't know that.
-That's the only way!

01:17:06,436 --> 01:17:07,562
We'll move in pairs.

862
01:17:07,604 --> 01:17:10,732
We'll go step by step
and cut off every bulkhead...

863
01:17:10,773 --> 01:17:12,968
and every vent
until we have it cornered...

864
01:17:13,009 --> 01:17:15,603
and then we'll blow it the fuck
out into space.

Obviously,
it means killing it...

How are our weapons?

of killing it.

lts structural perfection...

943

only by its hostility.

945
01:26:16,091 --> 01:26:17,991
l admire its purity.

l've heard enough of this.

952
01:26:39,314 --> 01:26:41,544
l'm asking you
to pull the plug.

953
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:43,983
ASH: Last word, Ripley.

954
01:26:44,019 --> 01:26:45,213
What?

955
01:26:46,855 --> 01:26:50,586
l can't lie to you
about your chances, but...

956
01:26:53,996 --> 01:26:55,827
you have my sympathies.

957
01:26:59,134 --> 01:27:00,396
RlPLEY:
We're going to blow up the ship.

958
01:27:02,304 --> 01:27:04,431
We'll take our chances
in the shuttle.

959
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,546
-Blow up the ship.
-Good.

960
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:09,112
PARKER: Come on.

961
01:27:36,508 --> 01:27:37,634
RlPLEY:
When we throw the switches...

962
01:27:37,676 --> 01:27:38,904
how long before the ship blows?

963
01:27:38,944 --> 01:27:40,912
-Ten minutes.
-No bullshit.

964
01:27:40,946 --> 01:27:42,243
PARKER: lf we ain't out
in ten minutes...

965

we won't need no rocket
to fly through space.

966

RlPLEY: We'll need coolant
for the air-support system.
