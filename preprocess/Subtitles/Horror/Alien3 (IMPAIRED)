As I thought, Mr. Aaron.

310
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:05,065
- As I thought.
- You called it, sir.

311
00:34:11,546 --> 00:34:16,813
I just wanted to, uh, say thanks for
what you said at the funeral.

312
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,585
My friends would have
appreciated it.

313
00:34:20,689 --> 00:34:23,453
Yeah, well, you don't
wanna know me, lady.

314
00:34:23,558 --> 00:34:26,152
<i>I'm a murderer</i>
<i>and rapist of women.</i>

315
00:34:29,064 --> 00:34:31,726
Really?

316
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:37,303
Well, I guess
I must make you nervous.

317
00:34:52,721 --> 00:34:56,418
- You have any faith, sister?
- Not much.

318
00:34:56,525 --> 00:35:01,360
Well, we've got a lot of faith here.
Enough even for you.

319
00:35:01,463 --> 00:35:04,091
I thought women weren't allowed.

320
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:06,099
Well, we've never had any before...

321
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:10,399
<i>but we tolerate anybody.</i>

322
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:15,135
- Even the intolerable.
- Thank you.

323
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:19,873
<i>That's just a statement of principle.</i>
<i>Nothing personal.</i>

324
00:35:19,981 --> 00:35:23,314
You see, we've got
a good place to wait here.

325
00:35:23,418 --> 00:35:27,013
And until now, no temptation.

326
00:35:32,427 --> 00:35:35,453
What are you waiting for?

327
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:42,994
Huh!
[Chuckles]

328
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:47,503
We're waiting for God to return...

329
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:51,409
<i>and raise his servants to redemption.</i>

330

<i>[Clemens] Dillon and the rest</i>
<i>of the alternative people...</i>

- <i>[Ripley] I'm on medication.</i>

333
00:36:06,494 --> 00:36:08,928
- <i>Hardly.</i>
- <i>What kind of religion?</i>

334
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:14,468
<i>Some sort of apocalyptic, millenarian,</i>
<i>Christian fundamentalist, uh</i>...

335
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:16,901
- <i>Right.</i>
- Exactly.

336
00:36:17,005 --> 00:36:19,803
Point is, when the company wanted
to close the facility down...

337
00:36:19,908 --> 00:36:23,571
Dillon and the rest of the converts
wanted to stay.

338
00:36:23,678 --> 00:36:27,774
And they were allowed
to remain as custodians...

339
00:36:27,882 --> 00:36:30,783
with two minders...

340
00:36:30,885 --> 00:36:33,547
and a medical officer.

341
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:35,714
And here we are.

342
00:36:35,824 --> 00:36:38,054
How did you get
this wonderful assignment?

343
00:36:40,996 --> 00:36:43,294
How do you like
your new haircut?

344
00:36:45,233 --> 00:36:47,133
It's okay.

345
00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:07,949
Now that I've gone out
on a limb for you with Andrews...

346
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:11,287
<i>damaged my already less-than-perfect</i>
<i>relationship with that good man...</i>

347
00:37:11,393 --> 00:37:13,793

348
00:37:13,895 --> 00:37:17,729
on the humdrum history
of Fury 161...

349
00:37:17,832 --> 00:37:20,164
can you not tell me what
you were looking for in the girl?

350
00:37:20,268 --> 00:37:23,294
You attracted to me?

351
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:25,464
In what way?

352
00:37:27,642 --> 00:37:29,610
In that way.

353
00:37:31,446 --> 00:37:33,971
Very direct.

354
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,348
I've been out here a long time.

355
00:37:40,055 --> 00:37:42,023
So have I.

356
00:38:28,568 --> 00:38:30,229
Yech!

357
00:38:39,645 --> 00:38:44,548
Hey, Spike.
Spike? Spikey!

I really appreciate your affections...

361
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:44,910
but I am aware that they...
deflected my question.

362
00:39:46,913 --> 00:39:49,848
In the nicest possible way, of course.

363
00:39:53,653 --> 00:39:55,780
<i>[Ripley]</i>
<i>You're spoiling the mood.</i>

365
00:39:59,825 --> 00:40:02,157
I just want to know why we had to
cremate the bodies.

366
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:05,628
And now that I'm in your cot...

<i>I had a terrible dream in hypersleep.</i>

And I had to be sure what killed her.

373
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,680
Anyway, I made a mistake.

374
00:40:26,786 --> 00:40:29,584
Possibly.

375
00:40:29,689 --> 00:40:33,682
[Sighs] And now I've made
another mistake.

376
00:40:33,793 --> 00:40:35,693
Really? What's that?

377
00:40:35,795 --> 00:40:38,423
<i>Fraternizing with a prisoner.</i>

378

<i>It's against the rules, isn't it?</i>

379
00:40:42,768 --> 00:40:46,864
Definitely. When was this?

380
00:40:46,973 --> 00:40:49,533
I think you know.

381
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,871

But I don't think
now is the moment.

No apologies, Mr. Aaron.
It wasn't your fault.

Well, not much to say, is there?

- Death was instantaneous.
- No shit.

403

I take it he was pulled
into the fan.

404
00:42:52,398 --> 00:42:54,332
A sudden rush of air,
I'd imagine, except...

405
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:56,492

At 0700 hours, I received word

I may point out this is the first
high-level communication...

00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,100
this installation has ever received
to my knowledge.

457
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:01,735
They want this woman looked after.

I have no idea.

But why did you let her
out of the infirmary?

461
00:47:10,421 --> 00:47:13,015
This accident with Murphy
is what happens...

01:01:03,819 --> 01:01:06,310
Then I'll talk to you. It's important.

619
01:01:06,422 --> 01:01:08,822
<i>When I have finished</i>
<i>with my official duties...</i>

620
01:01:08,924 --> 01:01:11,984
I will be quite pleased
to have a little chat, yes?

621
01:01:16,398 --> 01:01:18,992
<i>[Andrews] Let me see if I have</i>
<i>this correct, Lieutenant.</i>

622
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:23,401
It's an eight-foot creature of some kind,
with acid for blood...

623
01:01:23,506 --> 01:01:26,100
and it arrived on your spaceship.

624
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:29,700
<i>It kills on sight</i>
<i>and is generally unpleasant.</i>

625
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:32,337
And, of course, you expect me to accept
all this on your word.

626
01:01:32,448 --> 01:01:34,780
No, I don't expect anything.

627
01:01:34,884 --> 01:01:39,719
- Quite a story, Mr. Aaron.
- Right, sir. It's a beauty.

628
01:01:39,822 --> 01:01:42,757
- Never heard anything quite like it, sir.
- Expect not.

629
01:01:42,858 --> 01:01:44,883
Tell me, Lieutenant,
what would you suggest we do?

630
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,729
Well, what kind
of weapons have you got?

631
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:51,800
This is a prison.

632
01:01:51,901 --> 01:01:54,369
It's not a good idea to allow prisoners
access to firearms.

633
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:56,233
What keeps them from killing you?

634
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:59,273
Fear. There's no way to escape.

635
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:03,311
With the arrival of the next supply ship,
the company will eliminate them.

636
01:02:03,412 --> 01:02:07,280
This is a maximum security prison...

637
01:02:08,818 --> 01:02:12,481
and you have no weapons of any kind?

638
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:18,590
We have some carving knives in the abattoir.
A few more in the mess hall.

639
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:22,095
Some fire axes scattered about the place.
Nothing terribly formidable.

640
01:02:22,198 --> 01:02:24,462
That's all?

641
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:26,501

<i>Mess hall, right away, people.</i>

649
01:03:02,204 --> 01:03:06,265
Isn't there any way off of this place?
Some way to escape?

650
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:10,106
[Laughs] No. Supply ship comes

Sick to my stomach.
Pissed off.

<i>blames everybody for everything.</i>

I don't know a perfect human.

668
01:04:15,677 --> 01:04:17,941
There's no such thing
as a perfect human.

- How about leveling with me?
- Could you be more specific?

684
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,748
When I asked how you got assigned here,
you avoided the question.

685
01:05:34,856 --> 01:05:38,019
And then when I asked about the prison
I.D. tattooed on the back of your head...

686
01:05:38,126 --> 01:05:39,957
<i>you ducked me again.</i>

687
01:05:42,965 --> 01:05:45,160
It's a long, sad story...

688
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,699
and more than
a little melodramatic.

689

Try me.

01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:55,676
- <i>[Liquid Swishing]</i>
- If you insist.

691
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:02,713
After my student years...

692
01:06:03,852 --> 01:06:06,821
despite the fact that I had become...

693
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:09,322
secretly addicted to morphine...

694
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,654
I was considered
to be most promising...

695
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,160
a man with a future.

696
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:21,465
And during my first residency,
I did a 36-hour stretch on an E.R.

697
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:26,298
So, I went out and I got
more than a little drunk.

698
01:06:26,408 --> 01:06:28,535
Then I got called back.

699
01:06:28,644 --> 01:06:30,771
<i>Boiler had blown on a fuel plant...</i>

700
01:06:30,879 --> 01:06:33,973
<i>and there were 30 casualties.</i>

701
01:06:34,082 --> 01:06:36,380
<i>And 11 of them died.</i>

702
01:06:36,485 --> 01:06:38,612
Not as a result of the accident...

703
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,154
but because I prescribed
the wrong dosage of painkiller.

704
01:06:43,325 --> 01:06:47,284
I got seven years in prison
and my license reduced to a 3-C.

705
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:52,596
At least I got off the morphine.

706
01:06:52,701 --> 01:06:54,828
I'm sorry.

707
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:58,765
I think I was let off lightly.

708
01:06:58,874 --> 01:07:01,775
Did you serve your time here?

709
01:07:03,979 --> 01:07:06,880
I got to know
this motley crew quite well.

710
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:10,816
<i>So when they stayed, I stayed.</i>

711
01:07:12,287 --> 01:07:14,585
Nobody else would employ me.

769
01:12:01,107 --> 01:12:03,007
How about showing us
a little leadership?

770
01:12:03,109 --> 01:12:05,043
<i>Forget fucking Shirley Temple.</i>
<i>You take charge.</i>

771
01:12:05,145 --> 01:12:07,375
- Right.
- <i>You run things here anyway.</i>

772
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:12,440
No fuckin' way.
I'm not the officer type.

773
01:12:13,586 --> 01:12:15,713
I just take care of my own.

774
01:12:15,822 --> 01:12:17,790
<i>[Man] Well, what does</i>
<i>this fucking beast want?</i>

775
01:12:21,161 --> 01:12:23,026
Is this mother
gonna try for us all?

776
01:12:26,466 --> 01:12:29,026
- Yeah.
- Well, ain't that sweet?

777
01:12:29,135 --> 01:12:31,865
- So how are we gonna stop it?
- [Clears Throat]

778
01:12:35,475 --> 01:12:38,239
- We have no weapons. Is that correct?
- Right.

779
01:12:38,345 --> 01:12:42,042
I haven't seen one
exactly like this before.

780
01:12:42,148 --> 01:12:44,548
<i>Moves differently.</i>

781
01:12:46,686 --> 01:12:49,177
But the others
were afraid of fire...

782
01:12:49,289 --> 01:12:51,257
Not much else.

783
01:12:52,559 --> 01:12:55,722
- Can we seal off this area?
- No chance.

784
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:57,990
The installation's 10 miles square.

785
01:12:58,098 --> 01:13:00,362
- <i>There's 600 air ducts</i>
<i>running to the surface.</i>
- What about video?

786
01:13:00,467 --> 01:13:03,129
I see these closed-circuit monitors
everywhere. We could try to find it that way.

787
01:13:03,236 --> 01:13:08,367
The video system hasn't worked in years.
Nothing much works here.

788
01:13:08,475 --> 01:13:10,636
<i>We've got a lot of technology,</i>
<i>no way to fix it.</i>

789
01:13:10,744 --> 01:13:13,144
- What 85 is trying to tell you is...
- Don't call me that!

790
01:13:13,246 --> 01:13:16,306
we ain't got no entertainment center,
no climate control...

791
01:13:16,416 --> 01:13:18,976
<i>no video system,</i>
<i>no surveillance...</i>

792
01:13:19,085 --> 01:13:22,577
no freezers, no fucking ice cream...

793
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:25,453
no rubbers, no women, no guns.

794
01:13:25,558 --> 01:13:26,456
All we got here is shit!

795
01:13:27,727 --> 01:13:30,423
Oh, what the hell are we
even talking to her for?

796
01:13:30,529 --> 01:13:33,930
She's the one
that brought the fucker.

797
01:13:34,033 --> 01:13:37,901
Why don't we just get her head
and shove it through the fucking wall?

798
01:13:38,003 --> 01:13:40,233
Sounds good to me.

799
01:13:40,339 --> 01:13:42,842
<i>[Dillon]</i>
<i>Morse.</i>

800
01:13:46,245 --> 01:13:48,338
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

801
01:13:49,549 --> 01:13:51,517
Hmm.

802
01:13:54,353 --> 01:13:56,321
Right.

803
01:13:57,323 --> 01:14:00,349
Right. What are we going to do?

804
01:14:14,807 --> 01:14:17,241
- What's this?
- Um...

805
01:14:17,343 --> 01:14:20,437
that leads from the mess hall
to the infirmary.

806
01:14:20,546 --> 01:14:22,514
It's a ventilation shaft.

807
01:14:22,615 --> 01:14:25,948
Then we go in there, flush it out.

808
01:14:26,052 --> 01:14:29,988
Hey. Hey, look, there's miles and miles
of tunnel through there.

809
01:14:31,023 --> 01:14:32,991
It won't go far.

810
01:14:34,093 --> 01:14:36,357
It'll nest in this area.

811
01:14:36,462 --> 01:14:38,430
Right around...

812
01:14:39,465 --> 01:14:42,923
- here.
- How do you know that?

813
01:14:44,203 --> 01:14:46,728
It's like a lion.

814
01:14:46,839 --> 01:14:49,034
It sticks close to the zebras.

815
01:14:49,141 --> 01:14:51,541
Zebras? Oh, right.

816
01:14:51,644 --> 01:14:54,306
But, look. Running around down here
in the dark... Are you kidding?

817
01:14:54,413 --> 01:14:56,813
Once you get out of this main shaft,
there's no overheads.

818
01:14:56,916 --> 01:15:00,044
- Don't we have flashlights?
- We've got thousands of'em, but no batteries.

819
01:15:00,152 --> 01:15:02,916
- I told you, nothing works.
- Torches?

820
01:15:03,022 --> 01:15:06,014
Do we have the capacity
to make fire?

821
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:09,390
Most humans have enjoyed that privilege
since the Stone Age.

822
01:15:10,496 --> 01:15:12,691
No need to be sarcastic.

823
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:18,402
Never been used. They were gonna
dump a lot of nuclear crap in there.

824
01:15:18,504 --> 01:15:21,598
<i>Never got around to it.</i>
<i>It's clean as a whistle inside.</i>

825
01:15:21,707 --> 01:15:24,175
This the only way in or out?

826
01:15:24,277 --> 01:15:28,008
That's right. Walls are
six feet thick, solid steel.

827
01:15:28,114 --> 01:15:30,514
<i>Really knew how</i>
<i>to build these babies.</i>

828
01:15:30,616 --> 01:15:33,517
You're saying we get
something in there...

829
01:15:33,619 --> 01:15:36,053
there's no way it can get out?

830
01:15:36,155 --> 01:15:39,352
That's right. No fucking way.

831
01:15:43,129 --> 01:15:44,926
[Whistles]

832
01:15:46,465 --> 01:15:48,729
This is where we keep it.
I forget what the stuff's called.

833
01:15:48,834 --> 01:15:52,292
- Quinitricetyline.
- I knew that.

834
01:15:52,405 --> 01:15:55,636
Right. I've got to get these section
arrangements organized with Dillon...

835
01:15:55,741 --> 01:15:58,335
for the paintbrush, uh...

836
01:15:58,444 --> 01:16:00,878
- So, um...
- David.

837
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:04,143
- Yeah. You can get
these drums organized.
- Right, 85.

838
01:16:05,084 --> 01:16:08,451
And, uh, don't call me that.

839
01:16:10,957 --> 01:16:14,859
What's this "85" thing?

840
01:16:14,961 --> 01:16:18,260
A couple of us sneaked a look at
his personnel file the day he arrived.

841
01:16:18,364 --> 01:16:20,332
It's his I.Q.

842
01:16:27,473 --> 01:16:29,600
I saw a drum of this stuff...

843
01:16:29,709 --> 01:16:31,836
fall into a beachhead bunker once.

844
01:16:31,944 --> 01:16:35,402
The blast put a tug
in dry dock for 17 weeks.

845
01:16:35,514 --> 01:16:37,482
Great stuff!

846
01:16:42,054 --> 01:16:45,080
All right. Let me get this straight.

847
01:16:45,191 --> 01:16:48,592
You want to burn it down
and out of the pipes...

848
01:16:48,694 --> 01:16:50,821
force it in here, slam the door...

849
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:53,524
- and trap its ass?
- Right.

850
01:16:53,633 --> 01:16:57,467
And you want help
from us y-chromo boys, huh?

851
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:59,435
You got something better to do?

852
01:16:59,538 --> 01:17:02,302
Why should we put our ass
on the line for you?

853
01:17:02,408 --> 01:17:03,375
<i>Your ass is already on the line.</i>

854
01:17:04,644 --> 01:17:06,236
The only question is...

855
01:17:06,345 --> 01:17:07,607
what are you gonna do about it?

856
01:17:09,013 --> 01:17:11,982
[Chattering]

857
01:17:21,592 --> 01:17:23,560
Look at this.

858
01:17:23,661 --> 01:17:26,152
There's only one of these fucking batteries
in 2,000 that works.

859
01:17:26,264 --> 01:17:28,425
- Hey, it could have been a lot worse.
- Yeah.

860
01:17:28,532 --> 01:17:33,060
We might have got
the paintbrush detail.
