I'm working on a five-year study,
with the help of Mary here,

311
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:03,026

God knows I'm all for helping people,
saving the world,

315
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:18,776
but doesn't everybody have
a problem sleeping these days ?

316

Life's too frantic.

What aboutyou, Nell ?

318
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:28,589
Um, well, it seems that
you all have trouble sleeping,

319
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:30,650
becauseyour lives
are exciting,

320
00:26:30,728 --> 00:26:33,060
and it's complicated, and you think
about it when you go to sleep.

321
00:26:33,131 --> 00:26:36,623
But, um, I don't know.
Nothing's ever really happened to me,

322
00:26:36,701 --> 00:26:38,635
so I don't have a reason
to sleep badly.

323
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:42,696
But in your application
you said you had trouble sleeping.

324
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:45,503
Mm-hmm, yes,
but it's not like them.

325
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:49,012
It's because, uh, there was
always somebody calling me,

326
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,105
there was always
somebody banging.

327
00:26:52,383 --> 00:26:56,342
Ever since I was little,
I took care ofmy mother.

328
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:01,187
And-- And she would wake up
in the middle ofthe night.

329
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:04,786
She would bang with her cane
on the wall.

330
00:27:04,862 --> 00:27:08,298
And it wasjust
this relentless--

331
00:27:08,366 --> 00:27:11,494
it was a relentless banging
all through the night.

332
00:27:12,837 --> 00:27:16,398
That's weird, because even though,
uh, she's dead,

333
00:27:16,474 --> 00:27:18,908

and I wake up.

Who lived here ?

Well, actually, thatmakes
fora verygoodbedtimestory.

360
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,373
Once upon a time,
there was a king who built a castle.

361
00:29:05,449 --> 00:29:07,383
His name was Hugh Crain.

362
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:09,646
A hundred and thirtyyears ago,

363
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,281
towns like Concord and Manchester
were the center ofAmerican industry.

364
00:29:13,357 --> 00:29:15,325
That's where Crain
made a fortune--

365
00:29:15,393 --> 00:29:17,588
on the backs ofworkers
in his textile mills.

366
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:20,187
Now, this man could have
anything he wanted,

367
00:29:20,264 --> 00:29:22,596
but what he wanted
more than anything...

368
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:24,601
was a house filled
with the laughter ofchildren.

369
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:28,070

all the carvings.

They all died at birth.

Then, a fewyears later,
Rene, she passed away,

377
00:29:47,758 --> 00:29:49,988
and Crain became
a total recluse.

378
00:29:50,061 --> 00:29:53,997
But he kept on building,
adding room upon room.

that sometimes at night...

'cause he actually swore me to secrecy.

-Why did she kill herself?
-Well, there are the stillborn children,

00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,944
although I like to think
it was more sinister,

426
00:32:33,012 --> 00:32:35,242
like maybe Hugh Crain was
a horrible monster and drove her to it.

Monster ? But he built this house
for the woman that he loved,

00:32:38,184 --> 00:32:40,118
like the Taj Mahal.

429
00:32:40,186 --> 00:32:42,552
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace.
It was a tomb.

And equally overdone.
