which you are about to see

2

is an account
of the tragedy

3
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,585
which befell a group
of 5 youths.

4
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:18,621
It is all the more tragic
in that they were young,

5
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,990
but had they lived
very, very long lives,

6
00:01:21,058 --> 00:01:23,092
they could not
have expected,

7
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,828
nor would they
have wished to see

8
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:28,964
as much of the mad and macabre
as they were to see that day.

9
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:33,335
For them, an idyllic summer
afternoon became a nightmare.

16

Yet none of the evidence
was more compelling

17
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:04,463
