1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,700
<i>(lecturer)</i> He died for love.

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,000
Born just after the Civil War,
Daniel Robitaille was the son of slaves,

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,000
an artist by trade.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,500
A wealthy landowner commissioned him
to paint the portrait of his daughter.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,600
They fell in love. She became pregnant.

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,400
Her father had his thugs chase
the poor man through the town.

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,000
When they caught him, they sawed off
his right hand with a rusty blade.

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,500
A nearby beehive was raided,

9
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,100
and the honeycomb smeared
over his bleeding, mutilated body.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,600
The crowd that had gathered
fled as the bees came for him.

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,300
He died for love.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,500
His resurrection began as rumor,
and grew into myth.

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,300
Say his name five times
in the mirror and he would appear.

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,600
A hook had replaced his severed hand.

15
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,600
Sorrow and hate fill his eyes.
Bees buzz about his lips.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,800
The myth has traveled
from place to place,

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,200
taking root in the most desperate areas.

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,000
Even here, in New Orleans,

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,800
murders have been
committed in his name.

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Yes, but is he real?

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Cabrini Green, Chicago, 1992.

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,000
Helen Lyle becomes
so obsessed by the myth

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,100
that she takes on
the persona of Candyman,

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
killing her victims with a hook.

25
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,900
Cabrini residents believe
she <i>was</i> the Candyman.

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,500
- What about you, Doctor Purcell?
- Do I believe in Candyman?

27
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,300
I believe in the myth.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,100
But the fact? The flesh and blood? No.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,000
- I'm afraid not.
- Prove it.

30
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Candyman,

31
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,400
Candyman,

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Candyman,

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Candyman,

34
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,300
Candyman.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,700
Well, that <i>is</i> a relief.

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,700
My publisher would never have
forgiven me. Imagine the headlines:

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,500
"Cambridge Scholar Eviscerated
with Hook on Book Tour."

38
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,400
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you
to meet our Candyman, Peter.

39
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,800
<i>- (crash)</i>
<i>- (cat meows)</i>

40
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,100
Oh, I'm sorry. These streets
have got me all turned around.

41
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,900
We were a little shy back there, were we?

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,400
- It's a gift?
- "To Ethan".

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,300
Ethan Tarrant.

44
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,600
Ethan, I'm sorry about
what happened to your father.

45
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,800
- He came to you for help.
- Have you any idea

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,900
- how many people contact me?
- My father wasn't a crackpot.

47
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,900
I'm not saying he was.

48
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,900
You told him there was no Candyman.

49
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,400
You told him to say the name -
and now he's dead.

50
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,900
Look, Ethan, I've seen this happen before.
People get sucked into the myth.

51
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,100
There's no myth.
Daniel Robitaille was real.

52
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,900
Daniel Robitaille has been dead
and buried for a very long time.

53
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,400
He's here.

54
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,500
You called him.

55
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

56
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,500
You're next, Purcell.

57
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,700
- Groin to gullet.
- You're as crazy as your father was.

58
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,800
Give me a shot of single malt.

59
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,400
Fucking murderer!

60
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,600
Hey!

61
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,700
Get him the fuck outta here!

62
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,800
You're next, Purcell.

63
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,800
Get out!

64
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,000
It's... my book.

65
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,500

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,100

<i>So when you pull on your costume</i>

<i>Do not call his name.</i>

91
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
Is he always so angry?

92
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,100
Guess so.

93
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,400
- And why do you think that is?
- Cos he's been hurt.

94
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,700
"Cos he's been hurt"(!)

95
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,300
Who hurt him, Matthew?

96
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,400
- Everyone.
- Hey, Annie. Look.

97
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Come here.

98
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,700
- If you stay there, I can paint you too.
- Ever tried using paper, Liz?

99
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,300
No way. I hate paper.
There's nothing on it.

100
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,600
But that's why it needs you to fill it up.
Besides, you can't keep a mirror, darlin'.

101
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,000
Why not? It's not going anywhere.

102
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,600
- It's your brother.
- It's only a couple of days till Mardi Gras.

103
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,000
- I said I'd get them plaster of Paris.
- I know, for their mask.

104
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,700
Annie, if there's one thing these kids
understand, it's taking care of themselves.

105
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,400
- I'll be back in the morning.
- Just go.

Hey, Pam.

107

No.

No, let's go.

- Annie, please. Don't start with me.

- Mother, what did Ethan say?
- Ah! Well, he barely even spoke to me.

He only wants to see you. Oh, Annie.

Does Dr. Lewis let you drink?

125
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,900
Dr. Lewis thinks I'm dyin' of cancer.

Says it doesn't
make a difference what I do.

127
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,400
We'll get that taken in.

You know the only thing I regret?

129

I never had a chance to grow out the grey.

I can tell you the exact day I got ill.

131
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
It was the day your father died.

132
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,000
- Stay back. Stand back.
- Can you comment on your son's arrest?

133
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,000
Just stay back!

134

Here you go, Octavia.
A cup of java with all the fixings.

137
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,800
It's the chicory in it.
It helps settle my stomach.

138

<i>(Octavia)</i> You are a life-saver, Paul.

00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Course, I'll be food for the worms by then.

141
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,700
I'd like a winter funeral -
especially with <i>this</i> climate.

142
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,700
Mrs. Tarrant? Ma'am.

143
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,300
- Maybe I should see him alone first.
- Yes, maybe that'd be best.

144
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,400
I wouldn't want to upset him.

145
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,300
We'll go to the cafeteria.
I hear the gumbo is good and hot.

146
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,400
Hey! My guardian angel.

147
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,600
- How are you?
- Ah, I've been better.

148
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
How's Mom?

149
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,500
She's coping.

150
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,200
- Do you want me to call the dean?
- There's... there's no need.

151
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,900
- He kicked me out three months ago.
- What?

152
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,800
Come on, Annie. Law school
was Dad's dream, not mine.

153
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,400
- I hated the classes, the teachers...
- The bar-hopping in the Quarter.

154
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,300
Just tell me what happened last night.

155
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,800
This asshole sat down
and he ordered a drink.

156
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,100
He started chewin' on his ice...

157
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,600
You're full of shit, Ethan, and you know it!

158
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,200
What happened?

159
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,800
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- The guy's a fuckin' freak.

160
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,400
- Too much inbreeding, if you ask me.
- Rules, Ray.

161
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,000
Think I'll let some country-club
pissant slip through our fingers?

162
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,400
The boy is getting sloppy.

163
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,900
The first three victims were John Does.

164
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,700
Until number four: Mr. Coleman Tarrant.

165
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,900
- Murdered like all the rest.
- And guess who found Daddy's body?

166
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,100
None other than young Ethan.

167
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,100
What is going on?
Are you protecting someone?

168
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,900
Am I protecting someone?

169
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,200
- I'll call Clay McPherson and...
- No, no, no.

170
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,300
- No lawyers.
- Family has some friends.

171
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,900
Can't help him now.

172
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,400
I knew kids like him in school.

173
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,900
Always thought they were better than me,

174
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,100
cos they lived in some fucking mansion
up on Esplanade Avenue.

175
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,100
You can't charm your way out of this one.
We're talking about murder.

176
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,500
Don't you get it, Annie? I did it.
I confessed. End of story.

177
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,900
Looks like I'm gonna be enjoyin'
Mardi Gras with my husband after all.

178
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,400
I know what this is about.

179
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,600
- Really?
- Sometimes people wanna be punished,

180
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
even when they've done nothing wrong.

181
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,500
You didn't kill Dad, Ethan.

182
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,900
You were just in the house that night.

183
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,800
- This has nothing to do with Dad.
- I think it does.

184
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,200
- Well, drop it anyway.
- What did you see?

185
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,000
- Leave it alone.
- Ethan!

186
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,800
I said, leave it alone!

187
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,500
- Damn!
- Time's up.

188
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,600
- I'm gonna find out what happened.
- No! No!

189
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,900
I'm sorry, Miss Tarrant,
but this is an open-and-shut case.

190
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,300
- He hasn't even hired an attorney yet.
- Your brother made a full confession.

191
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,000
What kind of evidence do you have?
There's no weapon, no blood on him.

192
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,800
- People heard him threaten the victim.
- That doesn't mean he killed him.

193
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,300
Look, we're talking about more
than Dr. Purcell's murder here.

194
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,800
What are you saying?

195
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,500
It's possible that Ethan was involved
in your father's death as well.

196
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,700
They were killed in exactly the same way.

197
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,300
This is insane.
My brother worshipped our father.

198
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,300
You have no idea what he's been through.
Find yourself another scapegoat.

199
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,300
My brother didn't do this.

200
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,000
We'll see.

201
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,700
<i>(Kingfish) This is going out to</i>
<i>the man with the hook. Hey, man, chill.</i>

202
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,400
<i>Relax. Have some gumbo or somethin'.</i>

203
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,500
<i>Even the Kingfish know</i>
<i>when to draw the line.</i>

204
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,100
Going somewhere, Ben?

205
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,900
- Oh, yeah. I got to do the do.
- Oh, oh. He's got to do the do.

206
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,800
Hey, what's the matter?
You don't like my cooking?

207
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
- That too hot for you?
- I'm not hungry.

208
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,400
You're a lightweight.

209
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,800
Do you think a family can be cursed?

210
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,500
When we were growing up, we thought
we were the luckiest kids in the world.

211
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,700
Ethan was so smart.

212
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,200
Daddy thought he'd be the first
Tarrant in the Supreme Court.

213
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,500
But when he died,

214
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,900
there was this... cloud.

215
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,000
Annie. Annie!

216
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,000
You gotta start thinkin'
of the good things in life.

217
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,000
You got a whole classroom full of kids
who give a damn because of you.

218
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,400
Plus, you got a stud-muffin for a husband.

219
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,700
At least, your mama thinks so.

220
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,900
- Whaddaya say we get outta here?
- Thought you'd never ask.

221
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,100
Hey! Get the hell outta here!

222
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,900
Goddamn tourist.

223
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,000
Gotta do the do.

224
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,100
Hm?

225
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,200
- Jesus!
- I'm sorry. I thought you heard me.

226
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,800
It's lookin' good.

227
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,300
I just can't seem to finish it.

228
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,300
<i>(Annie)</i> The happy family.

229
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,100
We'll do better. I promise.

230
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,400
Daddy loved this house.

231
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,500
Even after we moved out,
he'd always drive us past it.

232
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,500
It was as if he was drawn to it.

233
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,800
<i>(Kingfish) Are you with me,</i>
<i>Crescent City? Do you feel it comin' on?</i>

234
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,000
<i>When the Catholic Church realized</i>
<i>they couldn't rid us of our pagan ways,</i>

235
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,900
<i>- they invited...</i>
<i>- (switches off radio)</i>

236
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,200
- What's that for?
- Just in case.

237
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,800
<i>- (switches on car alarm)</i>
- That's a good idea, honey.

238
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,800
Jesus.

239
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,100
This explains a lot.

240
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,100
Paul, I haven't lived here for 13 years.

241
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,600
Annie!

242
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,900
- I don't think we're alone.
<i>- (clinking)</i>

243
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,700
Oh...

244
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,600
You scared the hell out of me.

245
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,900
Keep your fucking hands off my things.

246
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,600
Sorry. I didn't mean to get in your way.

247
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,400
Goddamn fool.

248
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,500
- Just like the others.
- Paul.

249
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,600
Annie, I was just explaining to Mr...

250
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,900
Look, we don't want to bother anyone.
We were just looking around.

251
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,500
You see, I used to live here.

252
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm with her.

253
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,800
And I thought I'd met <i>all</i> your relatives.

254
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,700
No, no, no! Annie,
what are we looking for here?

255
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,000
- Something happened to Ethan that night.
- He found your father.

256
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,200
But it's more than that. Follow me.

257
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,800
This... was my bedroom.

258
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,300
Oh, this is nice.

259
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,400
Ah, see?

260
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,700
You got the room with the view.

261
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,300
Those were the old slave quarters. Ethan
and I were never allowed to play there.

262
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,600
It happened in there.

263
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,000
Ow!

264
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,400
- My God, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

265
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,000
- Let's just get outta here, Annie.
- I'll be right back.

Annie, I really wish you'd take the day off.

275

Right now, those kids are
the only thing that's keeping me sane.

- OK.

278

Guys, what's going on here?
Cut this out and stop fighting.

Boys... Liz, what's his name?

Stop this! Why are you doing this?

00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,100
Drew, Matt, stop it!

282
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,000
- We were making masks...
- I'll take over from here.

283
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,400
Wait a second. Stop it.
What is the problem?

284
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,000
Matthew! Drew! Now stop it!

285
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,100
- What is going on?
- He started it.

286
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,300
- Liar.
- He did. Look.

287
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,200
Matthew?

288
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
What is it?

289
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,800
It's the Candyman. They killed him.

290
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,200
Listen, guys. There's
no such thing as a Candyman.

291
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,700
It's just a story, a really scary story. And
these come from Matthew's imagination.

292
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,500
- But what about all the murders?
- Well...

293
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,200
Sometimes there are people in this world
that do bad things. Horrible things.

294
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,700
When they don't get caught, we blame
imaginary monsters for their crimes.

295
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,700
But that's all the Candyman is.
An imaginary monster.

296
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,400
But he lives in the mirror.
That's how he gets ya, from the mirror.

297
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,900
Five times. If you say his name
five times, he's supposed to come.

298
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,600
You guys don't really
believe that, do you?

299
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,000
Well, I guess I'm just
gonna have to prove it, then.

I can't believe you actually did that.

309
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,100
It was the only way
I could convince them.

310
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
And maybe yourself?

311
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,400
- What does that mean?
- I think you know.

312
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,900
What?

313
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,800
Are you ready for dessert?

314
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,800
Again?

315
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,500
Come on.

316
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,000
There are no monsters.

317
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,600
<i>(hums)</i>

318
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,800
Shit!

319
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,800
Do you need any help out there?

320
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,500
No, no, everything is fine, Annie.

321
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,000
Paul?

322
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,200
Annie.

323
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,100
Annie.

324
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,900
I am the writing on the wall,

325
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,300
the whisper in the classroom.

326
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,400
Annie,

327
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,400
I came for you.

328
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,700
Ready or not...

329
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,100
Paul...

330
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,500
We have a journey to make,

331
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,500
you and I.

332
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,500
McKeever negotiates the steps,
saves the dessert. What a guy!

333
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,700
<i>(tray crashes)</i>

334
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,700
Annie, be with me.

335
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,800
You're mine.

336
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,900
Mardi Gras - every night's
like a full moon.

337
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,700
If you ask me, that family won
the jackpot in the shit sweepstakes.

338
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,300
Give it a rest, Ray.

339
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,600
Take your time.
Anything you can remember.

340
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,700
It was him.

341
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,100
Him? Who is "him"?

342
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,700
He just came out of the shadows.

343
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,600
He had this hook
that came out of his arm,

344
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,100
and bees were crawling out of his face.

345
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,000
Miss Tarrant, it is Mardi Gras. Now, if you
saw some kind of freak in a costume...

346
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,900
It wasn't a mask.

347
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,500
- He's real.
- Of course.

348
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,700
What about my brother?

349
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,400
There's no reason to think
your husband's murder...

350
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,700
That's bullshit and you know it.
He's innocent.

351
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,500
Well, if he is,

352
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,700
then that just leaves you, doesn't it?

353
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,300
Oh, Annie. Annie.

354
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,000
Oh, Mom. Oh, Mom.

355
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
Oh, thank heavens...

356

<i>(whispers)</i> She's lyin'.

00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,500
We're almost home, honey.

359
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,300
Here.

360
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,700
- Do you think I'm crazy, too?
- Annie, don't talk like that.

361
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,100
Why did Daddy
go to the house that night?

362
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:28,300
- What did he know?
- Annie, please. You should rest.

363
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,500
Did he ever talk about him?
Did he ever mention the Candyman?

364
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,700
Just go to sleep. That's what you need.

365
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,500
That's what we <i>all</i> need.

You killed Paul.

Swallow your horror,
and let it nourish you.

No!

Annie! It's all right. It's all right.
You were just dreamin'.

00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:32,500
- Mother, I saw him.
- Annie, death is a return, you know.

382
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,100
We leave life just like we came in.

383
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,900

- Naked, blind,

Oh, no, but not me.

386

00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,500
It's no one, Annie. Why don't you

393
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,600
Send them up.

397
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,400
Now, tell me exactly what happened.

398
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,300
- All we know is that Matthew's gone.
- He disappeared last night.

399
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,600
- The cops have been talkin' to everyone.
- They don't know a thing, but, what if?

400
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,000
<i>(Kingfish) Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.</i>

401
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,000
<i>Now you makin' me proud, New Orleans.</i>

402
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,200
<i>We are eatin' the meat raw.</i>

<i>I tell ya what. I'm not</i>
<i>goin' home till this is over.</i>

404
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,900
<i>I'm on the air full time.</i>

<i>Man, somebody bring me a hurricane.</i>

406
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,000
<i>Somebody find this Kingfish a woman.</i>

407
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,600
<i>Lent starts tomorrow, mes amis,</i>
<i>and me, I want somethin' tasty to give up.</i>

408
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,600
- Who you lookin' for?
- I'm Matthew's teacher.

409
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,000
- I'm lookin' for his father.
- The Reverend's not seeing anyone.

410
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:00,000
- Please. I wanna help.
- Help?

411
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,500
We've had way too much of that already.

412
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,600
- Go on back to your classroom.
- You don't understand...

413
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,100
- We understand, all right.
- Understand what?

414
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,800
I always worried about him
being on the street after dark, but...

415
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,500
he didn't want his daddy taggin' along
when he went to buy his paints, so...

416
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,500
- like a fool, I let him go alone.
- What did the police say?

417
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,300
The police don't give a damn.

418
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:31,400
They figure, one less drug dealer
or potential murderer to worry about.

419
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,800
- But they don't know my son.
- Matthew has seemed withdrawn, lately.

420
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,600
Ever since his mother died,
he's been having nightmares.

421
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,600
- Has he talked about them?
- No, but they must have been pretty bad.

422
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,500
He doesn't sleep in his room any more.
He just sits up all night, painting.

423
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,500
- It's the only thing that calms him.
- Can I see them? The paintings.

424
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,600
He calls this his studio.

425
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,600
Oh, Lord.

426
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,800
Did he ever mention the Candyman?

427
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,200
All the kids have heard of the stories.
But I never thought he'd believe them.

428
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,000
But how did it happen to Matthew?

429
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,100
I see it every day.

430
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,100
The people around here are desperate.
They have no reason for hope.

431
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,100
Some of 'em get sucked into the pit.
They turn to false gods.

432
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,100
I am not gonna let that happen to my son.

433
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,900
But what if it's true?

434
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,100
What if the Candyman does exist?

435
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,500
Then only God can save us.

436
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,400
Come on, guys, let's go home.

437
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,200
No, I'm gettin' this up.

438
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,500
- Come on. Come on, guys.
- I'm tryin' to do this.

439
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,200
- Come on, now, leave me alone.
- Push it.

440
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,000
Damn. What do you want me to do?

441
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,500
Bees got him.

442
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,900
You will all be punished.

443
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,100
<i>(laughter)</i>

444
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,300

<i>(Kingfish) That's right,</i>

<i>Ash Wednesday.</i>

450

<i>Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.</i>

451
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,300
I just stood there and watched Paul die.

452
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,700
And now Matthew.

453
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,400
I said his name to those kids, Ethan.

454
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,600
Oh, Jesus.

455
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,800
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to protect you.

456
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,800
You and Mom.

457
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,900
But it wasn't enough.

458
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,500
- It'll never be enough.
- What did you see that night?

459
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,200
What was Daddy doing there?

460
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,100
He believed, Annie.
He even convinced me.

461
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,400
You weren't around to see
how obsessed he became.

462
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,500
I mean, all Dad ever talked
about was callin' the...

463
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,300
Callin' <i>him.</i> It got so bad,
I was afraid to leave him alone.

464
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,300
But, that night, he got away from me.

465
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,600
<i>I knew exactly where he'd go.</i>

466
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,100
<i>He'd been goin' to the house every night.</i>

467
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,200
<i>(bloodcurdling scream)</i>

468
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,800
I blew it, Annie.

469
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:01,000
- If I'd gotten there five minutes sooner...
- But why? Why did he call him?

470
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,300
Dad said he'd found a way to destroy him.

471
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,000
- What has our family got to do with this?
- I don't know.

472
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,200
Dad wouldn't tell me.

473
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,700
Before he died, he got in touch with this
guy who trafficked in black market stuff.

474
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,700
- Stolen art, weird shit.
- What was his name?

475
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:21,700
- He won't talk to ya. I tried.
- His name.

476
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,500
Thibideaux. He's in the Quarter.

477
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,400
No, don't go. It's too dangerous.

478
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,900
- I must find out what Dad was looking for.
- Wait till I get out.

479
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,200
There isn't time.

480
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,600
Besides, you'll be safe here.

481
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,100
There's always someone watching.

482
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,400
- I think you've done this before.
- Oh, yeah.

483
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,300
- Come on, get it where it's drippin' there.
- I'm gonna try.

484
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,000
Would <i>you</i> care for something sweet?

485
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,500
A small snowball, please.

486
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,800
Cherry?

487
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,400
Cherry would be fine.

488
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,500
Sweets for the sweet.

489
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,000
Would you like something else?

490
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,200
I'm looking for a man named Thibideaux.

491
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:17,600
Well, I don't think I'm acquainted
with anybody by that name.

492
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:24,200
- It's about my father.
- Maybe you should talk to your daddy.

493
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,500
He's dead.

494
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,500
He was murdered.

495
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,200
Coleman Tarrant.

496
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,600
Clara,

497
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:43,500
why don't you run on ahead to that party
and I'll meet you over there, OK?

498
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:49,300
I'll have you know, Honoré, I intend
to collect on that drink you promised me.

499
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,600
<i>(Honoré)</i> Oh, yeah, baby.
I'm countin' on it.

500
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,000
Hello.

501
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,300
You wait here.

502
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,800
I'm gonna take a look.

503
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:17,600
Your father understood the difference
between history and age.

504
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,800
Some pieces are merely old.

505
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,800
Others have history.

506
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,500
And history, because it reflects life,
is not always pretty.

507
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,700
It eats, it - if you'll pardon
the expression - shits.

508
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,900
Most of the objects your father sought

509
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,100
held history within them.

510
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,700
Your father found out that the Candyman
was born here in New Orleans.

511
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,200
His name was Daniel Robitaille.

512
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,900
And she was his lover.

513
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,700
Caroline Sullivan.

514
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,500
Your father was almost as obsessed
with her as he was with the Candyman.

515
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,500
Why?

516
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,200
There was something of hers
he most desperately wanted.

517
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,500
Her mirror.

518
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,500
Those who witnessed the horror

519
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:23,300
said that Robitaille's suffering
was so agonizing,

520
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:29,800
so unbearable, that his soul
became trapped in Caroline's mirror.

521
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,700
And my father thought
he could stop him with it.

522
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,100
Break the mirror, break the curse.

523
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,500
Where's the mirror now?

524
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:46,400
Who knows? Caroline found it next to
Robitaille's body and disappeared.

525
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,500
There were rumors, of course. Suicide...

526
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,800
Your father never believed that, though.

527
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:04,800
Let me go.

528
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,100
<i>(buzzing)</i>

529
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,900
What do you want from me?

530
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,400
There's a life that grows inside you now.

531
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,100
A daughter.

532
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,400
You cannot change who you are.

533
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,800
<i>(yelling)</i>

534
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,600
<i>(whistles)</i>

535
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,400
Come on!

536
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,200
Shit.

537
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,600
<i>You have a life</i>
<i>that grows inside you now.</i>

538
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,600
<i>A daughter.</i>

539
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,200
Oh, Paul.

540
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,900
Who am I?

541
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,600
<i>(children's laughter)</i>

542
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:21,100
<i>(Kingfish) The world is turning, brothers</i>
<i>and sisters, fast towards tomorrow.</i>

543
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,400
<i>And I'm not the man I used to be.</i>

544
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,100
<i>I got hooves on my shoes</i>
<i>and horns on my head.</i>

545
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,700
<i>I want life on a platter, medium rare.</i>

546
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,300
<i>And you can keep the silverware,</i>
<i>cos tonight I'm eatin' with my hands.</i>

547
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,400
Who's there?

548
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:57,600
Robitaille was born
right here in New Orleans.

549
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,500
- I know.
- I called him in front of Matthew.

550
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,200
All slave births were registered here.

551
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,600
Daniel Robitaille.

552
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,200
He was born at the Esplanade Plantation.

553
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,400
That's my family's house.

554
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,900
That's where <i>I</i> was born.

555
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,900
There's more.

556
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,100
If what Matthew believes is true,

557
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,400
I hope you can stop it.

558
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,500
God bless you.

559
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,500
They had a daughter.

560
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,900
Officer, they told me to make a report.

561
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,600
Sit down over here.

562
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,700
Take a look. Take a good look.

563
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,600
- I can't keep doing this.
- Look! More of your sister's handiwork.

564
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,800
- No! Annie didn't do that.
- Come on, cut the bullshit!

565
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,500
I'm on to your sick games!

566
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:07,000
- Why do you keep sayin' this?
- You've been coverin' for her all along.

567
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,600
You don't know what
you're talkin' about! It's him!

568
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:13,100
Who? Your friend the Candyman?

569
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,300
- You afraid, Tarrant?
- Let me go.

570
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,800
Should we call him?

571
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,100
- You're crazy.
- Candyman.

572
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,000
- Candyman.
- No, don't.

573
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:27,100
Candyman. Candyman.

574
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,600
- Don't.
- Candyman.

575
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,400
No!

576
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:46,700
No!

577
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,300
No!

578
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,600
Stop!

579
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,200
I said, stop!

580
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,800
<i>(sirens)</i>

581
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:38,700
We were just wondering if you'd seen
Mrs. Tarrant's daughter, Annie.

582
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,200
No, there's been no activity at all.

583
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,800
<i>No!</i>

584
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,400
<i>No!</i>

585
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:51,100
<i>No! God, no!</i>

586
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,500
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Has there been any sign of her?

587
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,600
No, ma'am.

588
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,200
Oh, Annie.

589
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,800
You lied to us from the beginning.

590
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,500
I've seen the birth certificate.
I've been to the cemetery.

591
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,000
No, it's not true.

592
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:22,600
It's true. Caroline bought the house
because that's where he was born.

593
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:26,500
And she raised their daughter
in that house. Your grandmother.

594
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,500
She was raised a white girl, and no one
suspected the truth. But Daddy did.

595
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:36,000
So Daddy started digging.
My father was trying to stop him.

596
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,500
- But you just kept on lying.
- I did it to protect you.

597
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:46,600
Oh, Annie, you just wait until you have
children of your own. You'll understand.

598
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,400
I'll never lie to my child.

599
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:52,000
Your father was tryin' to
destroy everything we had

600
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:57,100
- by linkin' our name with that monster.
- So you destroyed it instead,

601
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,600
- by denying the truth.
- I am not a part of him!

602
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,500
- We're his family!
- No!

603
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,600
- We're his blood!
- I will not have you talk like that.

604
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,700
You can't wash him away with a bottle!

605
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,800
There is no Candyman.

606
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,300
He does not exist.

607
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,400
My child.

608
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:37,100
You doubted me -
your own flesh and blood.

609
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:45,300
Death is a return, you know.

610
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Annie...

611
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,900
Annie, it's almost time.

612
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,100
Time for our journey.

613
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:21,400
Soon we'll be together,
just the way I planned.

614
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:25,700
You cannot resist what is in your blood.

615
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,800
Our blood.

616
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,000
Your baby's blood.

617
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,700
You can't fight what is meant to be.

618
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:45,400
The choice will be yours, Annie.

619
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,800
I'm so sorry.

620
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,900
No!

621
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,300
Miss Tarrant!

622
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:01,800
<i>(banging)</i>

623
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,800
Go on! Quick! Go around the back there.

624
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,200
Annie, I'm not gonna hurt you.

625
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,700
Ethan's dead.

626
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,800
I'm sorry. He was shot trying to escape.

627
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:35,800
Detective Levesque's body
was found... mutilated.

628
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,100
The guards assumed...

629
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:43,400
I watched the video tape
of what happened in that room.

630
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Ray's body was torn apart
by somethin' powerful,

631
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:51,600
and it wasn't your brother.

632
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:00,100
You better hurry before they get here.

633
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,100
<i>(Kingfish) 29 minutes to go, New Orleans.</i>

634
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,600
<i>29 minutes till judgment.</i>

635
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:28,300
<i>So get drunk, get fatter, and get fucked.</i>

636
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:33,000
<i>Yeah, you're right. I said it.</i>
<i>Y'all can trust the Kingfish.</i>

637
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,000
<i>The heavens have just opened up on us</i>
<i>and the banks of the Mississippi</i>

638
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,600
<i>are about to burst.</i>

639
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:13,900
<i>I don't think they're gonna</i>
<i>hold it back any more.</i>

640
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,900
<i>They're as full as the Kingfish's belly.</i>

641
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,400
<i>Yeah, Mardi Gras.</i>

642
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,500
Where is it?

643
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,500
Where is it?

644
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,300
God damn you!

645
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,800
The slave quarters.

646
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,500
Matthew! Oh, my God!

647
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:50,200
Are you all right?
I was so worried about you.

648
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,500
You should go home.

649
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,300
I knew when you called him, he'd come.

650
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,500
Like before.

651
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,600
You were hiding here.

652
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,200
He's in my dreams, Annie.

653
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,000
- I know.
- I had to see...

654
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:10,500
I wanted to see him for real.

655
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:15,300
Matthew, I need to find the mirror.

656
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,000
It must be down there. Be careful.

657
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,600
Annie!

658
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,600
Go back! Get some help, Matthew!

659
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,300
Annie, don't.

660
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,800
The mirror is the secret of my strength.

661
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,500
The keeper of my soul.

662
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,200
The destiny of our family.

663
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:53,700
Annie, our journey begins.

664
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,400
This is why I brought you here.

665
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,900
I was not always this way.

666
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,100
This is who I've become.

667
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:13,700
You must see what they did.

668
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,800
My only sin was to love Caroline,
and to give her a daughter.

669
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,000
They took everything from me, Annie.

670
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:32,500
Let me go.

671
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,100
My family.

672
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,200
Did you think
you could get away from us?

673
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:42,000
My child. My life.

674
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,200
No!

675
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,500
Be my witness.

676
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:17,800
See how I became
the reflection of their hatred.

677
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,900
<i>Their evil.</i>

678
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,900
<i>(woman)</i> Kill him!

679
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,700
<i>See what it means</i>
<i>to call me by that name.</i>

680
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,600
Candyman.

681
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:40,300
- Candyman.
<i>- (all chant)</i> Candyman, Candyman.

682
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:45,800
- Candyman.
- Sweets to the sweet!

683
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:38,000
My pain was unbearable.

684
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,300
<i>But Caroline's was even greater.</i>

685
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,800
Let him go!

686
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:50,200
Stop her!

687
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:52,400
No!

688
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,800
- Father!
- Caroline.

689
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,300
You will all be damned.

690
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:12,600
You defiled my daughter.

691
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:18,300
- Father.
- Could she even look at you now?

692
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:26,900
Candyman...

693
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:39,100
Now, do you see
what was taken from me?

694
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,400
Yes.

695
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,800
No! No!

696
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,800
<i>They killed me, Annie.</i>

697
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,900
<i>But they could not destroy my soul.</i>

698
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:09,700
Join me, Annie. We will go together

699
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,500
to a world without pain.

700
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:15,700
No more pain.

701
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,900
Death is only the beginning.

702
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:24,700
Your cradle will be your grave.

703
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,600
- Annie.
<i>- (Octavia)</i> Annie.

704

<i>- (Paul)</i> Annie.

710
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,200
Annie!

711
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,700
Grab my arm, Annie!

712
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:54,000
- Annie!
<i>- (Drew)</i> Grab my hand!

713
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:56,700
Grab my hand!
Come here! Grab my hand!

714
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,600
Go! Go!

715
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,200
Go!

01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:21,700
Go!

717
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,500
Annie,

718
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:42,100
the choice is no longer yours.

719
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,600
You are mine.

720
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:54,200
The cradle is <i>your</i> grave, not mine.

721
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,100
No.

722
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:36,800
Go! Let's get out of here. Go!

723
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:16,000
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

724
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:28,900
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

725
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:50,900
<i>(Kingfish) Yeah, it's Lent.</i>
<i>So y'all take it easy.</i>

726
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,400
<i>We made it through another one,</i>
<i>New Orleans.</i>

727
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,800
<i>And the Kingfish hope</i>
<i>you got plenty to atone for.</i>

728
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,700
<i>Hope you all said</i>
<i>a fond farewell to the flesh.</i>

729
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,600
<i>Hey, it's the cycle, Crescent City.</i>

730
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:07,700
<i>And we are startin' it again.</i>

731
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:25,000
- Mommy, let's look at some more.
- Just a few more pages.

732
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,900
That's your mommy. She's pretty.

733
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,800
That's right.

734
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,200
And who's that?

735
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:40,500
That little girl is
your great-grandma, Isabel.

736
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,200
And that's her mommy, Caroline.

737
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:45,700
That's my name, too.

738
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,700
- Who's that?
- That's Isabel's daddy.

739
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:55,700
And when you get a little older,
I will tell you a story about him.

740
01:28:56,100 --> 01:29:00,400
- Tell me now.
- Uh-uh. Right now, it's time for your nap.
