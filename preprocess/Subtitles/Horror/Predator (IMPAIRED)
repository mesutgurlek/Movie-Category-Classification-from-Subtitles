Come on inside.

Eighteen hours ago,
we lost a chopper...

5
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,426
carrying a cabinet minister
and his aide...

6
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,385
from this charming
little country.

7

We´ve got a transponder fix
on their position about here.

8
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:08,016
This cabinet minister...

9
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:10,893
does he always travel
on the wrong side of the border?

10
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:14,730
Apparently
they strayed off course...

11
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:16,648
and we´re fairly certain
they´re in guerrilla hands.

12
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:18,566
Why don´t you use
the regular army?

13
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:20,484
What do you need us for?

14
00:04:20,963 --> 00:04:24,320

accused you of being the best.

17
00:04:41,103 --> 00:04:41,583
What´s the matter?

18
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:44,460
The CIA got you pushing
too many pencils?

19
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:46,378
Huh?

20
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:50,214
Had enough?

21
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:52,132
Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.

22
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:56,927
OK! OK, OK.

Come on. Forget about my tie.

you pulled in Berlin.

-Why´d you pass on Libya?
-That wasn´t my style.

31
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:16,108
DILLON: You got no style.
You know that.

32
00:05:16,588 --> 00:05:18,026
Come on. Why did you pass?

33
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:23,781
We´re a rescue team...
not assassins.

34
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:28,576
Now, what do we got to do?

35
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:31,453
The cabinet minister´s important

36
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:32,412
in this part of the world.

00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:35,289
DILLON: Our friends
are about to get squeezed.

38

We can´t let that happen.
We need the best.

Simple setup.
One-day operation.

42
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:44,879

run ´em down...

43

and cross the border...

44
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:48,716
before anybody knows
we were there.

We all have our orders, Major.

Once you reach your objective...

the situation and take charge.
