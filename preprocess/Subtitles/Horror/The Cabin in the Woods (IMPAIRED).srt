1
00:00:57,742 --> 00:00:59,307
It's hormonal.

2
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:04,641
I mean, I don't usually fall
back on.. It's women's issues.

3
00:01:04,642 --> 00:01:08,104
But child-proofed how?
Gates and stuff?

4
00:01:08,105 --> 00:01:09,497
Dude, she did the drawers.

5
00:01:09,498 --> 00:01:11,813
We don't even know if this
whole fertility thing's going to work..

6
00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:14,679
she's screwed in these little jobbies
where you can't even open the drawers.

7
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,575
At all?

8
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,705
No. They open an inch,
then you got to dig your finger in.

9
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:21,031
- It's a nightmare.
- I guess sooner or later..

10
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:23,509
Yeah, a lot later.
She did the upper cabinets.

11
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,490
Kid will be 30 before he can
reach them, assuming we have a kid.

12
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:31,691
It is natural for
her to feel protective.

13
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,105
Don't even.. You have women's issues.

14
00:01:34,106 --> 00:01:36,985
Please. You of all people.

15
00:01:36,986 --> 00:01:38,583
Oh, come on. It's a jinx.

16
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:41,949
It guarantees that
we won't get pregnant.

17
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,987
And it takes me about 20
minutes to get a fucking beer.

18
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:46,342
Guys. Guys!

19
00:01:46,343 --> 00:01:47,605
Stockholm went south.

20
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:50,722
Seriously?
I thought they were looking good.

21
00:01:50,723 --> 00:01:51,824
What cracked?

22
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:54,938
I haven't seen the footage.
Word's just going around

23
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,042
Well, that's never
been a stable scenario.

24
00:01:57,043 --> 00:01:59,125
Everyone knows you can't trust Swedes.

25
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:01,859
That means there's just Japan.
Japan and us.

26
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,624
It's not the first time
it's come down to that.

27
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,466
Japan has a perfect record.

28
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:06,953
We're number two. We try harder.

29
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:08,532
If we fail, then..

30
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:10,285
Please. We haven't
had a glitch since '98.

31
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:11,719
We know what we're doing, Lin.

32
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,208
Or we have it written down..
somewhere.

33
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,006
You guys better not
be messing around in there.

34
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:19,307
Does this mean you're not in
the betting pool this year? Big money.

35
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:22,408
I'm just saying, it's a key scenario.

36
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,988
No, I hear what you're saying.

37
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:27,199
In '98, it was the chem.
department's fault, right?

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,613
Where do you work, again?
Wait. It's coming back to me, now.

39
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:35,196
It's going to be a long weekend
if everyone's that puckered up.

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,028
You want to come over Monday night?

41
00:02:38,029 --> 00:02:41,737
I'm going to pick up some power drills.
Liberate my cabinets.

42
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,566
Are you even listening to me?

43
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,084
Professor fuckwad.

44
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:34,988
Why haven't you stuck that asshole's
picture on the dartboard yet?

45
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,063
It's not that simple
Oh, my God!

46
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:40,727
Your hair. It's blonde.
- Very fabulous, no?

47
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:43,560
I can't believe you did it.
- But very fabulous, right?

48
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:47,316
Hurry up with the "very fabulous. "
I'm getting insecure about it now.

49
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:50,058
No, it looks awesome.
Curt's going to lose it.

50
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:53,015
Curt's going to thank me.
And so will you..

51
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,975
while we're burning this picture.

52
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:56,159
Not ready.

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,979
Seriously, this isn't his fault.

54
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,326
What's not his fault?

55
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:04,758
Fucking his student or
breaking up with her by email?

56
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,723
I knew what I was getting into.

57
00:04:06,724 --> 00:04:07,434
Oh, please.

58
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:09,247
You know what you're
getting into this weekend?

59
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,428
This.

60
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:15,202
And if Holden's as
cute as Curt says he is..

61
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:16,888
possibly getting out of it.

62
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,106
That is the last thing that I want.

63
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:21,742
If you treat this like a setup,
I'm going to have no fun at all.

64
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:22,887
I'm not pushing..

65
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,226
but we're packing this!

66
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,217
Which means we definitely
won't have room for..

67
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:30,829
What if I get bored?

68
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,213
These will help?

69
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:36,572
Soviet Economic Structures?
Aftermath of the..

70
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:40,649
No! We have a lake and a keg.

71
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,428
No more learning!
- Think fast.

72
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:44,042
Faster than that.

73
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:45,043
{TYRES SQEAKING}

74
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,365
Sorry. Sorry. Move along.

75
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:51,177
Nice!
- Is that Holden?

76
00:04:51,178 --> 00:04:53,980
We'll be right down.
He just transferred from State.

77
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:56,684
Best hands on the team.
He's a sweet guy.

78
00:04:56,685 --> 00:04:58,194
And he's good with his hands.

79
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:00,738
I'm kinda seeing this girl..

80
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:03,158
but you're way blonder than she is.

81
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:06,966
But I was thinking, you know, maybe..
What is this?

82
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:09,244
What.. this?
What are you doing with these?

83
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,692
Okay, I get it. I'll leave the books.

84
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:12,947
No, who gave you these?
Who taught you about these?

85
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:14,817
I learned it from you, okay?

86
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:17,143
I learned it from watching you!

87
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:22,535
Seriously, Professor Bennett, he
covers this whole book in his lectures.

88
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:26,594
You should read this.

89
00:05:26,595 --> 00:05:29,094
Gurovsky. Now this is way
more interesting.

90
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,819
Also, Bennett doesn't
know it by heart..

91
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,486
so he'll think you're insightful.

92
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:35,402
And you have no pants.

93
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,644
Oh, shit!

94
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,620
- That pretty much it?
- Fucking better be.

95
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:47,481
You know, Jules,
it's a weekend, not an evacuation.

96
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:50,742
Trust me when I say there
is nothing in those cases..

97
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:52,084
you won't be glad I brought.

98
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,016
I'm shutting' right up.

99
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:59,808
Oh, my God.

100
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,758
Marty!

101
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:09,351
Fuck is wrong with you, bro?

102
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:17,007
People in this town drive
in a very counterintuitive manner.

103
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,795
That's what I have to say.

104
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,196
Do you want to spend
the weekend in jail?

105
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:24,539
We'd all like to check
out my cousin's country home.

106
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,163
Honey, that's not okay.

107
00:06:26,164 --> 00:06:27,765
Statistical fact..

108
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:31,882
Cops will never pull over
a man with a huge bong in his car.

109
00:06:31,883 --> 00:06:32,494
Why?

110
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:36,454
They fear this man.
They know he sees further than they..

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,102
and he will bind them
with ancient logics.

112
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:44,276
Have you gone gray?

113
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:46,623
You're not bringing
that thing in the Rambler.

114
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:47,925
What?

115
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:50,952
A giant bong in your father's van?

116
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:54,070
What are you, stoned?

117
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:56,934
Hey, man.

118
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:01,962
Dana, you fetching minx!

119
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,590
You have any food?

120
00:07:05,462 --> 00:07:06,734
Everybody ready?
- Yeah!

121
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:10,005
Yeah?
- Okay, I'm ready!

122
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:12,398
Let's get this show on the road!

123
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:33,072
Nest is empty. We're right on time.

124
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:37,744
I hope this is the right road.

125
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:40,174
It doesn't even show up on the GPS.

126
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:42,209
It is unworthy of global positioning.

127
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:46,115
That's the whole point.
Get off the grid, right?

128
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,456
No cell phone reception..

129
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:50,744
no traffic cameras.

130
00:07:50,745 --> 00:07:54,041
Go someplace for one goddamn
weekend where they can't..

131
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:56,634
globally position my ass, man.

132
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:59,117
This is the whole issue.

133
00:07:59,118 --> 00:08:00,875
Is society crumbling, Marty?

134
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:03,536
No. Society is binding. Right?

135
00:08:03,537 --> 00:08:06,823
It's filling in the
cracks with concrete.

136
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:11,418
Everything's filed or
recorded or blogged, right?

137
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:14,829
Chips in our kids' heads
so they won't get lost.

138
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,988
Society needs to crumble.

139
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:19,907
We're all just too
chicken-shit to let it.

140
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:21,595
I've missed your rants.

141
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:24,769
You will come to see things my way.

142
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,692
Identification, please.

143
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:36,040
Mr. Sitterson.

144
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:39,062
Mr. Hadley.
- Thank you.

145
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:41,238
What's your name?
- Daniel Truman, sir.

146
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:43,551
This isn't the military.
You can drop the "sir".

147
00:08:43,552 --> 00:08:47,304
But Sitterson does
like to be called "ma'am. "

148
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:49,948
Or "honey toes. "
- He'll also answer to "honey toes. "

149
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:51,217
You clear on what's
going to be happening here?

150
00:08:51,218 --> 00:08:52,709
I've been prepped. Extensively.

151
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,846
Did they tell you that being prepped
is not the same as being prepared?

152
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:58,443
They told me.
I'll hold my post, Mr. Hadley.

153
00:08:58,444 --> 00:08:59,192
Good man.

154
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:02,618
Okay. System's online.

155
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:06,396
Acquiring target.
Let's see what we got.

156
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:44,682
I'm thinking this thing
doesn't take credit cards.

157
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:48,514
I don't think it knows about money.

158
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:50,915
I think it's barter gas.

159
00:10:12,186 --> 00:10:13,417
Hello?

160
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,514
Hey, Holden.

161
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:28,212
Holden!
- I don't think there's going to be..

162
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:30,527
You come here uninvited?
- Fuck!

163
00:10:36,388 --> 00:10:38,107
Sign says "closed. "

164
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:40,814
Yeah, we were looking to buy some gas.

165
00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:43,187
Does this pump work?

166
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:44,788
If you know how to work it.

167
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:48,209
We also wanted to get directions.

168
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,439
We're looking for.. What's it called?

169
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,012
Tillerman Road.
Do you know if it's this way?

170
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,491
Tillerman Road takes
you up the hill, there.

171
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,532
Dead-ends at the old Buckner place.

172
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:03,563
My cousin bought a house up there.

173
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:05,686
You go through a mountain tunnel,
there's a lake.

174
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:07,990
Would that be the..
- Buckner place.

175
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:11,150
Always someone looking
to sell that plot.

176
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:13,038
You knew the original owners.

177
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,525
Yeah, not the first.

178
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:20,854
I seen plenty come and go.
Hell, I been here since the war.

179
00:11:20,855 --> 00:11:23,396
- Which war?
- You know damn well which war!

180
00:11:23,397 --> 00:11:29,096
Would that have been with
the blue and some in gray?

181
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:33,495
Brother, perhaps,
fighting against brother in that war?

182
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:34,586
You sassing me, boy?

183
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:36,212
You were rude to my friend.

184
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:38,902
That whore?

185
00:11:38,903 --> 00:11:42,413
What'd you say?
- I think we got enough gas.

186
00:11:42,414 --> 00:11:43,661
You got enough to get you there.

187
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,670
Getting back..

188
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,689
that's your concern.

189
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:03,586
Well, good luck with
your business, sir.

190
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:06,678
I know the railroad's coming
through here any day, now.

191
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,679
That's going to be big.

192
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,088
Streets paved with actual street.

193
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:13,196
Fucker.

194
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:31,102
This must be it.

195
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,581
Oh, my God. It's.. beautiful.

196
00:13:47,582 --> 00:13:50,852
One spider and I'm
sleeping in the Rambler.

197
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:52,389
I mean it.

198
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,031
Come on. Give me a hand.

199
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:53,612
This is awesome.

200
00:14:53,613 --> 00:14:55,131
It is kind of cool.

201
00:14:55,132 --> 00:14:57,421
You going to kill us a raccoon to eat?

202
00:14:57,422 --> 00:14:59,056
I will use its skin to make a cap.

203
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:04,853
Everybody get your suits on. In
10 minutes, we're heading to the lake.

204
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:05,837
Yeah.

205
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,876
I was not informed there
would be calisthenics.

206
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,719
Yeah, I don't think so.

207
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,586
Whoa.

208
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:45,419
No way.

209
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,311
Ah, shit.

210
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,152
This is happening.

211
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,193
Hold up!

212
00:16:23,325 --> 00:16:27,185
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

213
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,782
That's just creepy.

214
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:31,311
It was pioneer days.

215
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:34,310
People had to make their
own interrogation rooms.

216
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:35,962
Who did your cousin
buy this place from?

217
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:38,671
We should check the rest of the rooms,
make sure this is the only one.

218
00:16:38,672 --> 00:16:41,023
'Cause you know Marty wants
to watch us pounding away.

219
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:43,861
I didn't even like hearing that.

220
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:50,972
How about we switch?

221
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,169
Not that I'd..

222
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,402
I mean, I'd put the picture back but you
might feel better if we switched rooms?

223
00:16:57,698 --> 00:16:58,849
I really would.

224
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:04,787
Thanks. For being decent.

225
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:05,851
It's the least I could do..

226
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:08,224
since Curt and Jules
sold you to me for marriage.

227
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:10,768
They're not subtle.

228
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:13,527
Well, I'll just be flattered
and keep it to myself.

229
00:17:13,528 --> 00:17:15,970
Yeah, I'm not looking for..

230
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:18,349
But, I'm still grateful
that you're not a creep.

231
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,014
Hey, let's not jump
to any conclusions there.

232
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:23,640
I had kind of an internal
debate about showing you the mirror.

233
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:26,487
Shouting on both sides.
Blood was spilled.

234
00:17:26,488 --> 00:17:28,436
So, you're bleeding internally?

235
00:17:28,437 --> 00:17:29,964
Pretty bad.

236
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:34,386
Well, Jules is pre-med.
You should probably talk to her.

237
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:38,127
Okay.

238
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:06,532
Wow.

239
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:29,522
Yeah, I don't think so.

240
00:18:58,273 --> 00:18:59,502
Places everyone.

241
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,020
We are live.

242
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:03,366
Engineering, we got a room change.

243
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:06,023
Polk is now in two, McCrea is in four.

244
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:09,607
Operations, do you copy?
We need a scenario adjustment.

245
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:10,862
Miss Lin.

246
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:17,058
We've got the blood work
back on Louden. Her levels are good.

247
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:19,353
But we're recommending
a fifty-milligram bump..

248
00:19:19,354 --> 00:19:21,256
of Rhohyptase to increase libido.

249
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:23,948
- Sold. - Do we pipe it in,
or do you want to do it orally?

250
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:26,581
Ask me that again, only slower.

251
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,449
You're a pig.

252
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,431
Guess how we're
slowing down cognition.

253
00:19:30,432 --> 00:19:31,225
I don't know.

254
00:19:31,226 --> 00:19:34,740
The hair dye.

255
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,494
Dumb blonde. Very artistic.

256
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:40,893
Works its way into the blood,
through the scalp. Very gradual.

257
00:19:40,894 --> 00:19:44,196
Chem department keeps their end up.

258
00:19:44,197 --> 00:19:45,913
I'll see it when I believe it.

259
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:47,524
Control?
- Yeah, go ahead.

260
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,826
I have the harbinger on line two.

261
00:19:49,827 --> 00:19:53,216
Oh, Christ. Can you take a message?

262
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:56,931
I don't think so. He's really pushy.

263
00:19:58,424 --> 00:20:00,849
To be honest,
he's kind of freaking me out.

264
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,604
Okay. Put him on.

265
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:06,310
Mordecai, baby, what's happening?
How's the weather up top?

266
00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:10,701
The lambs have passed through the gate.
They are come to the killing floor.

267
00:20:10,702 --> 00:20:12,979
Well, you're doing
a great job out there.

268
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,246
By the numbers, man.
You got us started off just right.

269
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:17,965
So, we'll talk to you later, okay?

270
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,402
Their blind eyes see nothing
of the horrors to come.

271
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:23,466
Their ears are stopped.

272
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:25,639
They are the gods' fools.

273
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,869
Well, that's.. how it works.

274
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:32,816
Cleanse them. Cleanse the
world of their ignorance and sin.

275
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:35,406
Bathe them in the crimson of..

276
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:37,601
Am I on speakerphone?

277
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:41,014
No. Absolutely not.

278
00:20:41,015 --> 00:20:42,995
Speakerphone, no.
No, I wouldn't do that.

279
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:45,117
Yes, I am. I can hear the echo.

280
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,679
Oh, my God. You're right.
Hang on one second, I'll take you off.

281
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,518
That's rude.
I don't know who's in the room.

282
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:54,501
Fine. There. You're off.

283
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:55,650
Thank you.

284
00:20:55,651 --> 00:20:57,867
Don't take this lightly, boy.

285
00:20:57,868 --> 00:21:00,660
It wasn't all by your numbers.

286
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:05,363
The fool nearly derailed
the invocation with his insolence.

287
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,124
The ancient ones see everything.

288
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,637
And they will not be..

289
00:21:09,638 --> 00:21:12,333
I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I?

290
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:16,545
Oh, my God. Mordecai.

291
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:19,306
I can't believe it. I did it again!

292
00:21:19,307 --> 00:21:20,551
Mordy?

293
00:21:20,552 --> 00:21:23,310
What happens next?

294
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:32,552
Oh! That's cold!

295
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:37,009
How cold? Is it worth it?

296
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:39,650
Come on, Jules. Life is risk.

297
00:21:39,651 --> 00:21:42,887
Yeah, I might just risk
lying out in the sun for a while.

298
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:44,172
Boo.

299
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:46,249
Hey, what is that?
- What?

300
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,685
In the lake, right there.

301
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:49,717
Oh, come on. - No you guys,
I'm serious. Right there.

302
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:52,534
There! There!
God, looks just like my girlfriend!

303
00:21:55,204 --> 00:21:56,435
Oh, my God!

304
00:21:56,436 --> 00:21:58,147
There's something else in the lake!

305
00:21:58,148 --> 00:22:02,873
It's a gorgeous man!
- I'm going to kill you!

306
00:22:02,874 --> 00:22:05,324
Don't kill the gorgeous man!
We're endangered!

307
00:22:11,703 --> 00:22:13,740
All right. Last chance.

308
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:18,600
It's post time. Dig deep, people.
Betting windows are closing. Okay.

309
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:19,485
Okay, who's still out?

310
00:22:19,486 --> 00:22:23,944
Let's see. We got engineering,
we got R & D, and we got electrical.

311
00:22:23,945 --> 00:22:25,493
Did you see who they picked?

312
00:22:25,494 --> 00:22:26,861
They're practically
giving their money away.

313
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:28,899
You should talk, Aquaman.

314
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,156
What do you mean?
- Ah, nothing.

315
00:22:32,446 --> 00:22:33,447
Okay, all right.

316
00:22:33,448 --> 00:22:35,827
I'm not even sure
we have one of these.

317
00:22:35,828 --> 00:22:37,100
Zoology swears we do.

318
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:40,178
They'd know. Okay. All right, people.

319
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:41,331
Hey, what do you got?

320
00:22:41,332 --> 00:22:43,601
No, they've already been picked.

321
00:22:43,602 --> 00:22:45,450
What? No. Who took them?

322
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:46,463
Maintenance.

323
00:22:46,464 --> 00:22:48,452
Maintenance?
They pick the same thing every year.

324
00:22:48,453 --> 00:22:49,517
What do you want from me?

325
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:51,122
If they were creative,
they wouldn't be in maintenance.

326
00:22:51,123 --> 00:22:53,245
You're going to have to split
this if you win. You want to switch?

327
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:57,939
I don't know, I don't know.
What do you think?

328
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,928
More than anything,
I just want this moment to end.

329
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:06,533
Not betting?

330
00:23:06,534 --> 00:23:07,833
Not for me. Thanks.

331
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:11,164
Seems a little harsh, doesn't it?

332
00:23:11,165 --> 00:23:13,689
It's just people letting off steam.

333
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:18,821
This job isn't easy,
however those clowns may behave.

334
00:23:18,822 --> 00:23:23,272
Does the director.
Do they know about this downstairs?

335
00:23:23,273 --> 00:23:24,645
The director doesn't
care about this stuff.

336
00:23:24,646 --> 00:23:26,423
As long as everything
goes smoothly upstairs..

337
00:23:26,424 --> 00:23:28,366
as long as the kids
do as they're told.

338
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,748
But then it's fixed.

339
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:31,456
No, no, no.

340
00:23:31,457 --> 00:23:34,706
How can you wager on this
when you control the outcome?

341
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:37,475
No, we just get 'em in the cellar.
They take it from there.

342
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:39,673
No, they have to make the
choice of their own free will.

343
00:23:39,674 --> 00:23:41,572
Otherwise the system doesn't work.

344
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:43,531
It's like the harbinger.

345
00:23:43,532 --> 00:23:48,229
It's this creepy old fuck, practically
wears a sign, "You will die. "

346
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,237
Why do we put him there? The system.

347
00:23:50,238 --> 00:23:52,754
They have to choose to ignore him..

348
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:55,101
and they have to choose
what happens in the cellar.

349
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,105
Yeah, we rig the game
as much as we need to..

350
00:23:57,106 --> 00:23:59,274
but in the end,
they don't transgress..

351
00:23:59,275 --> 00:24:00,573
hey can't be punished.

352
00:24:00,574 --> 00:24:04,263
So what's it going to be, Truman?
You in? Window's closing.

353
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:08,181
I'm fine.

354
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,421
Okay.

355
00:24:11,422 --> 00:24:12,915
That's it, gang!

356
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,511
The board is locked!

357
00:24:14,512 --> 00:24:16,897
Oh, let's get this party started!

358
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:19,393
Let's get this party started!

359
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:31,721
There you go.

360
00:24:31,722 --> 00:24:33,744
Okay, my turn.

361
00:24:33,745 --> 00:24:34,897
Jules.

362
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:39,668
Truth or dare?

363
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:40,858
Let's go dare.

364
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:42,180
All right.

365
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:46,083
I dare you to make out with..

366
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,985
Please say "Dana," please say "Dana. "

367
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,750
That moose, over there.

368
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,846
Marty..

369
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:55,595
have you ever seen a moose before?

370
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:59,872
Whatever that mysterious beast is.

371
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,441
That's a wolf.

372
00:25:02,837 --> 00:25:05,556
I'm living in a womb of reefer,
leave me alone.

373
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:07,638
Jules..

374
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,522
I dare you to make out with that wolf.

375
00:25:11,674 --> 00:25:12,776
No problem.

376
00:25:37,857 --> 00:25:39,016
Who?

377
00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:40,986
Me?

378
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,675
Well, yes, I am new in town.

379
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:45,693
How did you know?

380
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:49,943
Oh, my God.
That is so sweet of you to say.

381
00:25:49,944 --> 00:25:51,904
I just collared it, in fact.

382
00:25:51,905 --> 00:25:53,306
No, no, no.

383
00:25:53,307 --> 00:25:55,700
There's no need to huff and puff.

384
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:58,894
I'll let you come in.

385
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,475
Thank you.

386
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,125
Yeah.

387
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,618
Now,...

388
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:49,667
Dana.

389
00:26:49,668 --> 00:26:50,648
Truth.

390
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:53,494
What's that supposed to mean?

391
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:55,033
I'm just skipping ahead.

392
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:57,150
You're going to say dare.

393
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:58,901
She's going to dare you to
do something you don't like..

394
00:26:58,902 --> 00:27:03,159
and then you'll puss out and
say that you wanted truth all along.

395
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,725
Really?

396
00:27:06,096 --> 00:27:07,878
Okay, Jules.

397
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:09,746
Dare.

398
00:27:11,141 --> 00:27:12,012
What the hell was that?

399
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:14,060
It's the cellar door.

400
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:17,181
The wind must've blown it open.

401
00:27:18,046 --> 00:27:20,119
That makes what kinda sense?

402
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,854
What do you think is down there?

403
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:27,714
Why don't we find out?

404
00:27:30,218 --> 00:27:31,349
Dana.

405
00:27:32,828 --> 00:27:34,098
I dare you.

406
00:27:49,921 --> 00:27:52,835
How long do I have to stay down here?

407
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:55,037
Oh, you know, just 'til morning.

408
00:28:30,391 --> 00:28:31,319
Dana.

409
00:28:32,096 --> 00:28:34,580
You okay?

410
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:36,016
Yeah.

411
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:40,521
Sorry, I just scared myself.

412
00:28:40,522 --> 00:28:42,923
Well, you called for help.
That voids the dare.

413
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:44,658
Take your top off.

414
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:46,128
What?

415
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:47,955
I don't make up the rules.

416
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:51,421
Oh, my God.

417
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:56,510
Look at all this.

418
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:01,674
Guys..

419
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:06,455
I'm not sure it's
awesome to be down here.

420
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:08,446
Guys?

421
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:13,417
Dude, seriously,
your cousin is into some weird shit.

422
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,159
I'm pretty sure this isn’t his.

423
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,083
Maybe it was the people
who put in that mirror thing.

424
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:26,309
Some of this stuff looks really old.

425
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,259
It's beautiful.

426
00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:34,863
Maybe we should go back upstairs.

427
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:41,550
I dare you all to go upstairs.

428
00:30:35,837 --> 00:30:36,687
Guys?

429
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,889
Guys, listen to this.

430
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,440
"April fourth.

431
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:46,694
"Father was cross with me
and said I lacked the true faith.

432
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:49,654
"I wish I could prove my devotion..

433
00:30:49,655 --> 00:30:52,206
"as Judah and Matthew
proved on those travellers. "

434
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:53,186
What is that?

435
00:30:53,187 --> 00:30:59,564
Diary of Anna Patience Buckner, 1903.

436
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:03,133
"Mama screamed most of the night.

437
00:31:03,134 --> 00:31:05,756
"I prayed that she might find faith..

438
00:31:05,757 --> 00:31:08,673
"but she only stopped
when Papa cut her belly..

439
00:31:08,674 --> 00:31:10,169
"and stuffed the coals in.

440
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,575
"Judah told me in my dream..

441
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:16,743
"that Matthew took him to the
black room, so I know he is killed.

442
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:21,891
"I want to understand the
glory of the pain like Matthew..

443
00:31:21,892 --> 00:31:28,155
"but cutting the flesh makes
him have a husband's bulge..

444
00:31:28,156 --> 00:31:30,019
"and I do not get like that. "

445
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,625
- Jesus. Can we not?
- No. Go on.

446
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:33,975
- Why?
- I want to know.

447
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:35,591
"I have found it..

448
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:40,104
"in the oldest books,
the way of saving our family.

449
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:42,964
"My good arm is hacked up..

450
00:31:42,965 --> 00:31:46,178
"and et,
so I hope this will be readable.

451
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:50,818
"That a believer will come
and speak this to our spirits.

452
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:54,719
"Then we will be restored
and the great pain will return. "

453
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,146
And then there's something in Latin.

454
00:31:59,147 --> 00:32:02,714
Okay, I'm drawing a line
in the fucking sand, here.

455
00:32:02,715 --> 00:32:04,175
Do not read the Latin.

456
00:32:06,953 --> 00:32:08,142
What the fuck?

457
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:11,241
- Dolor..
- No, no.

458
00:32:11,242 --> 00:32:13,573
- Stop being a fucking baby.
- Curt!

459
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:14,483
It's a diary.

460
00:32:14,484 --> 00:32:16,493
It doesn't even mean anything.

461
00:32:16,494 --> 00:32:20,305
- Dana!
- "Dolor supervivo caro.

462
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:25,002
"Dolor sublimis caro.

463
00:32:25,003 --> 00:32:29,622
"Dolor ignio annivos. "

464
00:33:00,468 --> 00:33:01,669
We have a winner!

465
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,118
It's the Buckners,
ladies and gentlemen!

466
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:06,691
The Buckners pull a 'W'.

467
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:13,129
All right. That means that
congratulations go to Maintenance!

468
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,932
Who share the pot
with Ronald the intern.

469
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:17,808
Yeah!

470
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:19,809
That's not fair. I had zombies, too.

471
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,887
Yes, you did. You had zombies.

472
00:33:21,888 --> 00:33:25,310
But this is
"Zombie Redneck Torture Family," see?

473
00:33:25,311 --> 00:33:27,243
They're entirely separate species.

474
00:33:27,244 --> 00:33:30,060
Like the difference between
an elephant and an elephant seal.

475
00:33:30,061 --> 00:33:32,745
There's always next year.

476
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:36,159
They're like something
from a nightmare.

477
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,263
No. They're something
nightmares are from.

478
00:33:40,264 --> 00:33:44,459
Everything in our stable
is remnant of the old world..

You get used to it.

483
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:56,457
Should you?

484
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:08,117
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

485
00:34:08,118 --> 00:34:10,236
- He had the conch in his hands.
- I know.

486
00:34:10,237 --> 00:34:12,268
A couple more minutes,
who knows what might've happened?

487
00:34:12,269 --> 00:34:15,517
I am never going to see a merman. Ever.

488
00:34:15,518 --> 00:34:16,798
Dude, be thankful.

489
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:18,384
Those things are terrifying.

490
00:34:18,385 --> 00:34:20,854
And the cleanup on
them is a nightmare.

491
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:25,566
So, the Buckners.

492
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:29,364
Yeah, well, they may be zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots..

493
00:34:29,365 --> 00:34:32,876
But they're our zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots.

494
00:34:32,877 --> 00:34:35,071
With a hundred percent clearance rate.

495
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:36,794
True. So should we call Japan?

496
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,714
Tell them to take the
rest of the weekend off?

497
00:34:39,715 --> 00:34:42,652
Yeah, right. They're Japanese.
What are they going to do? Relax?

498
00:34:42,653 --> 00:34:45,169
I'd just like to see them
fall on their asses, for once.

499
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,198
Oh, God, don't even joke.

500
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,040
Every other branch has air-balled.

501
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:52,153
We need the Japanese crew to get it
done. There's too much riding on this.

502
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:35,471
Fuck, yeah, baby.

503
00:35:36,503 --> 00:35:37,860
This is so classy.

504
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:40,134
Come on, like you wouldn't
want a piece of that.

505
00:35:40,135 --> 00:35:43,594
Can we not talk about people
in pieces any more tonight?

506
00:35:43,595 --> 00:35:47,542
Are you feeling lonely, Marty?

507
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:53,299
Marty and I were sweeties
in our freshman hall.

508
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,588
We made out once.

509
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:58,621
I never did buy that ring.

510
00:35:58,622 --> 00:36:00,517
But we're still..

511
00:36:02,738 --> 00:36:04,146
close.

512
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:11,253
I have a theory about all this.

513
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:13,178
That's our cue to bail.

514
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:17,014
Tommy Chong here has a theory.
Come on, baby.

515
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:20,707
Don't worry,
you can tell it to Egghead, here..

516
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:22,888
if he's not too busy
devirginizing Dana.

517
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,932
Jules, do you want to go lie down?

518
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:29,575
That's exactly the point.
Come on. Mush. Mush.

519
00:36:29,576 --> 00:36:30,623
Don't push me around.

520
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:32,035
Not around, baby. Straight line.

521
00:36:53,667 --> 00:36:56,632
You seriously believe
nothing weird is going on?

522
00:36:57,943 --> 00:36:58,956
Conspiracy?

523
00:37:00,038 --> 00:37:01,880
The way everybody's acting.

524
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:05,235
Why is Jules suddenly a celebu-tard?

525
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:09,807
And since when does Curt
pull this alpha-male bullshit?

526
00:37:09,808 --> 00:37:13,003
I mean, he's a sociology major.

527
00:37:13,004 --> 00:37:15,170
He's on full academic scholarship..

528
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:17,978
and now he's calling
his friend an egghead?

529
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:19,743
Curt's just drunk.

530
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,008
I've seen Curt drunk.

531
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:24,829
Jules, too.

532
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,957
Well, then, maybe it's something else.

533
00:37:30,503 --> 00:37:31,995
You're not seeing
what you don't want to see.

534
00:37:34,273 --> 00:37:36,124
Puppeteers.

535
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,304
Puppeteers?

536
00:37:38,305 --> 00:37:39,475
Pop-Tarts?

537
00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:40,910
Did you say you have Pop-Tarts?

538
00:37:40,911 --> 00:37:44,719
Marty, I love you,
but you're really high.

539
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,430
We are not who we are.

540
00:37:53,858 --> 00:37:57,211
I'm going to go read
a book with pictures.

541
00:37:57,212 --> 00:38:01,528
Thank you.
- "The pain outlives the flesh.

542
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:05,676
"The flesh returns.. "
or "has a meeting place. "

543
00:38:05,677 --> 00:38:06,819
What is that?

544
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,735
The Latin that you
read in the basement.

545
00:38:09,736 --> 00:38:10,493
You speak Latin?

546
00:38:10,494 --> 00:38:14,676
Not well. Not since tenth grade.

547
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:17,156
Weird how it all comes back.

548
00:38:17,157 --> 00:38:19,742
Well, it's a weird kind of night.

549
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,639
I'm sorry about tonight.

550
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,331
Everybody..

551
00:38:24,332 --> 00:38:28,282
Do I lose points if I tell
you I'm having a pretty nice time?

552
00:38:28,283 --> 00:38:33,300
No. You can tell me that.

553
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:41,155
What are you running away for?

554
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:49,895
Don't spill on me!

555
00:38:49,896 --> 00:38:51,420
Did I get a little beer on your shirt?

556
00:38:54,307 --> 00:38:55,705
I guess it'll have to come off, huh?

557
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:59,413
Not here.

558
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:01,907
Baby, come on.

559
00:39:01,908 --> 00:39:03,894
We're all alone.

560
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:15,541
I'm chilly.

561
00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:20,744
Okay, guys. That's it.
Let's go. We've got a job to do.

562
00:39:20,745 --> 00:39:23,650
Your basic human needs disgust me.
Get out of here.

563
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:26,039
- Do we have temperature
control in this sector? - On it.

564
00:39:29,523 --> 00:39:33,947
Engaging pheromone mists.

565
00:40:00,586 --> 00:40:02,162
It's so dark.

566
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:03,585
Take me inside?

567
00:40:03,586 --> 00:40:05,231
Come on. This is why we came here.

568
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:08,953
It's romantic.

569
00:40:25,962 --> 00:40:30,449
Okay, baby. Let's see some boobies.

570
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,300
Show us the goods.

571
00:40:33,972 --> 00:40:36,097
Does it really matter if we see her..

572
00:40:36,098 --> 00:40:37,126
We're not the only ones watching, kid.

573
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:39,341
Got to keep the customer satisfied.

574
00:40:42,056 --> 00:40:43,534
You understand what's at stake, here?

575
00:41:27,245 --> 00:41:28,304
Score.

576
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:02,314
Jules!

577

{SCREAMING LOUDLY}

579
00:43:18,851 --> 00:43:20,860
This we offer in humility and fear.

580
00:43:22,097 --> 00:43:24,652
For the blessed peace
of your eternal slumber.

581
00:43:24,653 --> 00:43:27,983
As it ever was.

582
00:44:18,737 --> 00:44:22,820
Nemo, man, you got to wake up.
Your shit is topsy-turvy.

583
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:27,736
I'm going to go for a walk.

584
00:44:27,737 --> 00:44:31,209
Okay. I swear to fucking God,
somebody is talking.

585
00:44:36,461 --> 00:44:38,938
Or I'm pretty sure someone is.

586
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:41,926
I'm going to go for a walk.

587
00:44:41,927 --> 00:44:43,688
Enough!

588
00:44:43,689 --> 00:44:45,573
What are you saying?

589
00:44:45,574 --> 00:44:48,002
What do you want?

590
00:44:49,797 --> 00:44:52,603
You think I'm a puppet, huh?

591
00:44:52,604 --> 00:44:55,235
You think I'm a puppet.
Going to do a little..

592
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:57,937
fucking puppet dance!

593
00:44:57,938 --> 00:45:01,001
I'm the boss of my own brain,
so give it up.

594
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:07,122
I'm going to go for a walk.

595
00:45:18,528 --> 00:45:19,483
I don't want to..

596
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:21,105
I mean, I've never..

597
00:45:21,106 --> 00:45:24,843
I don't mean "never"..

598
00:45:24,844 --> 00:45:25,739
Hey.

599
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,936
Nothing you don't want.

600
00:45:32,273 --> 00:45:34,329
He's got a husband bulge.

601
00:45:53,093 --> 00:45:54,798
I thought there'd be stars.

602
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:01,102
We are abandoned.

- Fucking run!

Dead bitch!

00:46:37,601 --> 00:46:39,355
Jesus, what happened?

607
00:46:39,556 --> 00:46:40,309
The fuck!

608
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:41,734
Curt, what the fuck?

609
00:46:41,735 --> 00:46:42,878
Where are you hurt?

610
00:46:42,879 --> 00:46:44,270
Is all of this from you?

611
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:46,264
It's okay! Curt, you're okay!

612
00:46:46,478 --> 00:46:47,592
Where's Jules?

613
00:46:49,233 --> 00:46:52,276
She's gone.

614
00:46:53,448 --> 00:46:55,972
We've got to get out of here.

615
00:46:55,973 --> 00:46:58,606
No. No.

616
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,548
Dana, don't open that..

617
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:01,035
I'm not leaving here without Jules.

618
00:47:01,036 --> 00:47:02,671
That dead girl's out there!

619
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:27,251
Dana, come on!

620
00:47:32,124 --> 00:47:33,062
What is that thing?

621
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:34,223
Fuck!

622
00:47:34,224 --> 00:47:35,577
I don't know,
but there's more of them.

623
00:47:35,578 --> 00:47:36,609
More of them?

624
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:38,393
I saw a young girl.

625
00:47:38,394 --> 00:47:40,163
All zombied like him..

626
00:47:40,164 --> 00:47:42,183
but she was missing an arm.

00:47:42,184 --> 00:47:45,875
Oh, my God. Patience.

00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,388
- We got to lock this place down.
- He's right.

630
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:53,573
We'll go room by room.
Barricade every window and door.

631
00:47:53,574 --> 00:47:57,439
We got to play it safe. No matter what
happens, we have to stay together.

632
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,191
Fuck!

633
00:48:00,192 --> 00:48:01,178
Calm down.

634
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:03,455
Watch the master work.

635
00:48:14,303 --> 00:48:15,647
This isn't right.

636
00:48:15,648 --> 00:48:17,346
What? What's the matter?

637
00:48:17,347 --> 00:48:20,973
This isn't right. We should split up.

638
00:48:20,974 --> 00:48:23,905
We can cover more ground that way.

639
00:48:23,906 --> 00:48:25,387
Yeah.

640
00:48:26,856 --> 00:48:28,358
Yeah. Good idea.

641
00:48:29,354 --> 00:48:30,741
Really?

642
00:48:32,941 --> 00:48:34,379
All right,
you guys, get in your rooms.

643
00:48:38,384 --> 00:48:39,635
Lock them in.

644
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:54,477

00:49:01,182 --> 00:49:02,660
What the..?

647
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,152
What the fuck?

648
00:49:13,153 --> 00:49:14,795
That's not good.

649
00:49:14,796 --> 00:49:16,756
Out of the way. Out of the way.
Out of the way.

650
00:49:16,757 --> 00:49:19,899
Chem department,
I need 500 CCs of Thorazine..

651
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,209
pumped into room three.

652
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,287
No, no, no.

653
00:49:22,288 --> 00:49:23,386
Stand by, Chem.

654
00:49:27,387 --> 00:49:29,652
Judah Buckner to the rescue.

655
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,255
What the fuck?

656
00:49:34,135 --> 00:49:36,014
Fuck! What the fuck?

657
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,815
Oh, my God.

658
00:49:42,257 --> 00:49:45,938
I'm on a reality TV show.

659
00:49:49,047 --> 00:49:53,126
{LAUGHING}
My parents are going to
think I'm such a burnout.

660
00:49:55,127 --> 00:49:59,127
{GLASS SHATTERING}

661
00:50:39,834 --> 00:50:44,017
Help me! Help me!

662
00:51:10,055 --> 00:51:12,055
Must be getting excited downstairs.

663
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:14,114
Greatest show on Earth.

664
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:32,957
Somebody help!

665
00:51:35,273 --> 00:51:36,874
Come on!

666
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:48,603
Use the bed!
- Come on! Come on!

667
00:52:03,944 --> 00:52:06,310
It's empty.
- Go.

668
00:52:08,937 --> 00:52:10,408
Curt?
- Unlock the door.

669
00:52:10,443 --> 00:52:12,670
I can't. Get down to the basement.

670
00:52:30,956 --> 00:52:32,271
This is the black room.

671
00:52:32,272 --> 00:52:33,957
Nice.

672
00:52:37,063 --> 00:52:38,102
From the diary.

673
00:52:40,169 --> 00:52:42,070
This is where he killed them.

674
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,082
This is where he kills us.

675
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:48,139
No way. No.

676
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,834
He's not going to kill us

677
00:52:49,835 --> 00:52:51,933
We just got to find a door.

678
00:52:51,934 --> 00:52:53,547
Okay?

679
00:52:57,134 --> 00:52:58,877
Let's just check the walls, okay?

680
00:53:00,057 --> 00:53:01,443
Curt?

681
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,345
I mean, there's got to be..

682
00:53:19,983 --> 00:53:21,645
You like pain?

683
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:27,237
How's that work for you?

684
00:53:50,863 --> 00:53:52,673
These fucking zombies.

685
00:53:52,674 --> 00:53:55,193
Remember when you could
just throw a girl in a volcano?

686
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:56,512
How old do you think I am?

687
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:07,330
Let's move! Come on! Come on! Go!

688
00:54:20,065 --> 00:54:21,166
What about Marty?

689
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:22,406
They got him.

690
00:54:57,903 --> 00:55:00,291
The devil is defeated.

691
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:03,788
Now Kiko's spirit will
live in the happy frog!

692
00:55:15,926 --> 00:55:17,049
Fuck you!

693
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:21,023
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

694
00:55:23,686 --> 00:55:25,908
- You seeing this?
- Perfect record, huh?

695
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:28,940
The Japan crew should've
had this in the bag. They fucked us.

696
00:55:28,941 --> 00:55:30,182
How hard is it to kill nine-year-olds?

697
00:55:30,183 --> 00:55:32,367
Zero fatality. Total wash.

698
00:55:32,368 --> 00:55:36,006
You want good product,
you got to buy American.

699
00:55:36,007 --> 00:55:38,273
Any word from downstairs?

700
00:55:38,274 --> 00:55:40,968
Downstairs doesn't care about Japan.
The director trusts us.

701
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:42,882
You just sweat the chem., Lin.

702
00:55:42,883 --> 00:55:45,741
While these morons are singing
What a Friend We Have in Shinto..

703
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,802
we are bringing the pain.

704
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:50,122
Yeah, and what the fuck's
up with this guy's pot, anyway?

705
00:55:50,123 --> 00:55:53,048
He's supposed to be drooling
and instead he almost makes us?

706
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,455
We treated the shit out of it.

707
00:55:54,456 --> 00:55:56,669
Okay, we've got the Rambler
heading toward the tunnel.

708
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,539
The fool's toast anyway.

709
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,480
And so are we if you
don't get this under control.

710
00:56:01,481 --> 00:56:04,261
Shit.
- What? "Shit" why?

711
00:56:04,262 --> 00:56:05,402
Got to go. Work to do.

712
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,628
You guys are humanity's last hope.
If the ancients rise..

713
00:56:07,629 --> 00:56:10,447
There's no cave-in.
- What?

714
00:56:10,448 --> 00:56:11,919
The fucking tunnel's open!

715
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,735
Control to Demolition.

716
00:56:14,736 --> 00:56:15,763
We're dark on the whole sector.

717
00:56:15,764 --> 00:56:16,992
Try to bypass it.

718
00:56:16,993 --> 00:56:18,814
- What the fuck do you think I'm doing?
- Open the door.

719
00:56:28,996 --> 00:56:31,633
Look out!
Get out of the way! Make a hole!

720
00:56:36,381 --> 00:56:38,503
What the fuck's going on?
- We don't know.

721
00:56:38,504 --> 00:56:40,092
Electrical said there
was a glitch up top.

722
00:56:40,093 --> 00:56:42,308
That tunnel should've blown hours ago.
- We didn't get the order.

723
00:56:55,692 --> 00:56:56,857
Hadley, what is going on?

724
00:56:56,858 --> 00:56:58,809
Hadley?

725
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:01,179
Why hasn't the tunnel blown?

726
00:57:52,353 --> 00:57:55,758
No, no. No fucking way!

727
00:57:58,144 --> 00:57:59,990
Can't believe this, man.
This isn’t happening.

728
00:57:59,991 --> 00:58:03,782
It's right there.

729
00:58:03,783 --> 00:58:06,275
All right.
We got any climbing gear? Ropes?

730
00:58:06,276 --> 00:58:08,478
Yeah. In my fucking dorm room.

731
00:58:08,479 --> 00:58:10,116
We can't go back.

732
00:58:10,117 --> 00:58:11,987
There's no way across.

733
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,595
What're we going to do? Jump?

734
00:58:13,596 --> 00:58:15,628
Dude.

735
00:58:16,831 --> 00:58:18,199
What?

736
00:58:24,744 --> 00:58:25,974
Curt, are you sure about this?

737
00:58:25,975 --> 00:58:27,262
I've done bigger jumps than this.

738
00:58:27,263 --> 00:58:28,675
You've got a smooth run..

739
00:58:28,676 --> 00:58:31,001
and maybe a five foot
differential on the other side.

740
00:58:31,002 --> 00:58:32,881
But you've got to give it everything.

741
00:58:32,882 --> 00:58:34,875
Curt.

742
00:58:38,252 --> 00:58:39,846
Look, you guys,
you stay in the Rambler.

743
00:58:39,847 --> 00:58:41,124
I'll get help.

744
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:44,373
If I wipe out,
I'll fucking limp for help.

745
00:58:44,374 --> 00:58:46,551
But I'm coming back here.

746
00:58:46,552 --> 00:58:49,855
I'm coming back with
cops and choppers..

747
00:58:49,856 --> 00:58:53,329
and large fucking guns,
and those things are going to pay.

748
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,648
For Jules.

749
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:07,088
Don't hold back.

750
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:10,124
Never do.

751
00:59:35,341 --> 00:59:36,984
No!

752
00:59:38,934 --> 00:59:40,018
Curt!

753
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:41,229
Oh, God!

754
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:52,299
He hit something.
There's nothing. What'd he hit?

755
00:59:54,539 --> 00:59:55,728
Puppeteers.

756
00:59:57,203 --> 00:59:59,673
Marty was right.

757
00:59:59,674 --> 01:00:01,530
Get in the van.

758
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:05,040
Dana.

759
01:00:09,336 --> 01:00:12,428
Marty was right.

760
01:00:31,448 --> 01:00:32,700
You're going back.

761
01:00:32,701 --> 01:00:34,417
I'm going through.

762
01:00:34,418 --> 01:00:37,942
And we'll just drive.
There's got to be another road.

763
01:00:37,943 --> 01:00:39,519
Another way out of here.
- It won't work.

764
01:00:41,245 --> 01:00:45,052
Something will happen.
It will collapse, it will wash away.

765
01:00:45,053 --> 01:00:46,945
Then we just leave
the roads altogether.

766
01:00:46,946 --> 01:00:51,922
Drive as far as we can into the
forest and we go on foot from there.

767
01:00:53,497 --> 01:00:55,593
You're missing the point.

768
01:00:55,594 --> 01:01:00,237
Please, do not go nuts on me,
okay, Dana? You're all I've got, now.

769
01:01:03,963 --> 01:01:05,666
I'm okay.

770
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:07,545
Good, okay, 'cause I need you calm.

771
01:01:07,546 --> 01:01:08,546
Okay, no matter what happens,
we got to stay..

772
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:10,762
Goddamn, that was close!

773
01:02:10,763 --> 01:02:12,563
Yeah, photo-fucking-finish.

774
01:02:12,564 --> 01:02:13,844
I don't understand.

775
01:02:13,845 --> 01:02:15,590
You're celebrating?

776
01:02:15,591 --> 01:02:18,546
They're celebrating. I'm drinking.

777
01:02:18,547 --> 01:02:20,335
But she's still alive.

778
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:22,277
How can the ritual be complete?

779
01:02:22,278 --> 01:02:24,806
The virgin's death is optional,
as long as it's last.

780
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:27,717
Main thing is that she suffers.

781
01:02:27,718 --> 01:02:29,219
That she did.

782
01:02:30,686 --> 01:02:32,734
It's so strange.

783
01:02:34,221 --> 01:02:36,068
I'm actually rooting for this girl.

784
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:38,239
She's got so much heart.

785
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,999
And you think of
all the pain and the..

786
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,723
Tequila is my lady! My lady!

787
01:02:46,724 --> 01:02:49,391
Come on in, guys!
Come on in. You're welcome.

788
01:02:49,392 --> 01:02:52,964
Tequila!
From darkness, there is light!

789
01:04:00,204 --> 01:04:02,041
I wish that I could do what you do.

790
01:04:02,042 --> 01:04:04,277
Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it's masterful.

791
01:04:04,278 --> 01:04:07,756
I don't know.
Tonight was solid. I don't know.

792
01:04:07,757 --> 01:04:10,790
Are you kidding? Classic denouement.
When the van hits the lake..

793
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:11,660
I screamed.

794
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:14,207
And the water rushing in,
and the zombies..

795
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:16,696
just think it would've
been cooler with a merman.

796
01:04:16,697 --> 01:04:19,266
Do you know if we get
the overtime bonus on this one?

797
01:04:19,267 --> 01:04:21,769
Accounting's over there. Ask them.

798
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:24,304
I don't need to.
I already know the answer.

799
01:04:24,305 --> 01:04:25,326
I'm an intern.

800
01:04:25,327 --> 01:04:30,000
So I don't qualify for OT.

801
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:32,221
It's funny that you like the ballet..

802
01:04:32,222 --> 01:04:36,881
because I happen to have
two tickets to your favourite..

803
01:04:39,049 --> 01:04:40,803
You knuckleheads.

804
01:04:40,804 --> 01:04:43,087
You almost gave me a
heart attack with that tunnel.

805
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:45,811
Like I said, it wasn't our fault.
We didn't get the order.

806
01:04:45,812 --> 01:04:48,005
I'm just giving you a hard time.

807
01:04:48,006 --> 01:04:51,213
Come on. Give us a hug.

808
01:04:51,214 --> 01:04:53,382
No, seriously. That wasn't our fault.

809
01:04:53,383 --> 01:04:56,173
There was a glitch.
Power re-route from upstairs.

810
01:04:57,573 --> 01:04:59,780
What do you mean, upstairs?

811
01:05:01,781 --> 01:05:05,781
{PHONE RINGING}

812
01:05:08,482 --> 01:05:10,882
{PHONE RINGING CONTINUES}

813
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:14,240
Turn the fucking music off.

814
01:05:16,241 --> 01:05:20,241
{PHONE RINGING CONTINUES}

815
01:05:29,096 --> 01:05:30,143
Hello?

816
01:05:30,144 --> 01:05:33,211
That's impossible. Everything
was done within the guidelines.

817
01:05:33,212 --> 01:05:34,863
The virgin's the only one..

818
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:38,274
No. I am not doubting you.

819
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:42,611
Which one?

820
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:26,288
Marty.
- Hi.

821
01:06:32,774 --> 01:06:34,056
Dana, come on.

822
01:06:59,603 --> 01:07:00,952
Marty. Wait.

823
01:07:00,953 --> 01:07:02,358
We're going in the grave?

824
01:07:03,738 --> 01:07:06,771
Dana, come on!

825
01:07:22,978 --> 01:07:24,205
What is this place?

826
01:07:27,577 --> 01:07:33,454
Yeah. I had to dismember
that guy with a trowel.

827
01:07:36,538 --> 01:07:38,022
What have you been up to?

828
01:07:42,567 --> 01:07:44,594
Nobody else, huh?

829
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:52,582
Yeah, I figured.

830
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:56,218
You figured everything.

831
01:07:56,219 --> 01:07:57,929
Oh, not at all.

832
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:01,415
But, I do know some stuff.

833
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:03,044
As in..

834
01:08:07,477 --> 01:08:10,242
It's an elevator.

835
01:08:10,243 --> 01:08:14,407
Somebody sent those dead
fucks up here to get us.

836
01:08:14,408 --> 01:08:19,693
Now, there's no controls inside, but
there's maintenance overrides in there.

837
01:08:19,694 --> 01:08:22,204
And I think I can get it to go down.

838
01:08:23,465 --> 01:08:25,149
Do we want to go down?

839
01:08:27,879 --> 01:08:29,662
Where else are we going to go?

840
01:08:33,049 --> 01:08:36,876
Come on. Get in.

841
01:08:49,604 --> 01:08:50,341
Come on!

842
01:08:50,703 --> 01:08:52,302
Fucking zombie arm.

843
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:54,060
Oh, shit.

844
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:05,076
We chose.

845
01:11:05,111 --> 01:11:07,442
What? What?

846
01:11:07,443 --> 01:11:08,300
Fuck!

847
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:22,117
All that shit we were playing with.

848
01:11:22,118 --> 01:11:24,224
They made us choose.

849
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:28,439
They made us choose how we die.

850
01:12:07,419 --> 01:12:09,802
We saw them go down the access drop.
They have to be in one of these.

851
01:12:09,803 --> 01:12:11,236
Internal security can..

852
01:12:11,237 --> 01:12:14,706
I don't care if it's not protocol.
Are you fucking high?

853
01:12:14,707 --> 01:12:17,010
It's the fool! Do not touch the girl.

854
01:12:17,011 --> 01:12:19,178
If he outlives her,
this whole thing goes to hell.

855
01:12:19,179 --> 01:12:20,792
Take him out first.

856
01:12:20,793 --> 01:12:23,012
Cleanup says the prep team
missed one of the kid's stashes.

857
01:12:23,013 --> 01:12:25,961
Whatever he's been smoking's
been immunizing him to all our shit.

858
01:12:25,962 --> 01:12:27,552
How does that help us right now? What?

859
01:12:27,553 --> 01:12:30,793
No, if you have a confirmed kill,
take her out, too.

860
01:12:30,794 --> 01:12:31,894
There.

861
01:12:31,895 --> 01:12:33,697
3606.

862
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,220
Gotcha.

863
01:12:36,221 --> 01:12:37,629
Bring 'em down.

864
01:12:55,949 --> 01:12:58,682
Step out of the elevator!
Step out of the elevator!

865
01:12:58,683 --> 01:13:01,766
Why are you trying to kill us?
- Step out! Just the girl!

866
01:13:01,767 --> 01:13:03,189
What? -Just me?

867
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:04,095
Do it!

868
01:13:15,448 --> 01:13:16,786
Good work, zombie arm.

869
01:13:41,989 --> 01:13:43,347
You shouldn't be here.

870
01:13:46,043 --> 01:13:48,258
This should've gone differently.

871
01:13:48,259 --> 01:13:49,977
Ended more quickly.

872
01:13:49,978 --> 01:13:54,274
I can only imagine
your pain and confusion.

873
01:13:54,275 --> 01:13:56,020
But know this.

874
01:13:56,021 --> 01:14:00,338
What's happening to you
is part of something bigger.

875
01:14:00,339 --> 01:14:02,816
Something older than anything known.

876
01:14:02,817 --> 01:14:07,033
You've seen horrible things.

877
01:14:07,034 --> 01:14:09,867
An army of nightmare creatures.

878
01:14:09,868 --> 01:14:13,210
But they are nothing
compared to what came before.

879
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:15,552
What lies below.

880
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:21,026
It's our task to placate
the ancient ones.

881
01:14:22,477 --> 01:14:25,222
As it's yours to
be offered up to them.

882
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:28,013
Forgive us.

883
01:14:28,014 --> 01:14:30,128
And let us get it over with.

884
01:14:30,129 --> 01:14:33,462
Come on. Go in that room.

885
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:57,359
Army of nightmares, huh?

886
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:08,183
Let's get this party started.

887
01:15:10,062 --> 01:15:10,958
Hold fire!

888
01:15:25,632 --> 01:15:26,823
Oh, shit.

889
01:15:42,421 --> 01:15:44,441
Go! Go! Go!

890
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,780
Lead officer Truman
to security command.

891
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:03,022
Requesting immediate reinforcements.
Code black. I repeat, code black.

892
01:17:03,023 --> 01:17:04,807
Where the fuck are you guys?

893
01:17:04,808 --> 01:17:08,513
Sector 12, down. Sector 8, down.

894
01:17:08,514 --> 01:17:11,135
Sector 3, down. Jesus Christ!

895
01:17:11,136 --> 01:17:13,423
Why aren't the defences working?
Where's the fucking gas?

896
01:17:13,424 --> 01:17:15,868
Something chewed through the
connections in the utility shaft.

897
01:17:16,113 --> 01:17:17,859
Something which?
- Something scary!

898
01:17:51,325 --> 01:17:52,895
The north exit is blocked.
You can't go there.

899
01:18:16,015 --> 01:18:17,545
Go, go, go!

900
01:19:09,771 --> 01:19:10,732
Fuck! We're running out of time!

901
01:19:10,989 --> 01:19:12,069
It's on lockdown,
I'm trying to bypass.

902
01:19:25,592 --> 01:19:27,465
Hadley!

903
01:19:57,422 --> 01:19:59,825
Oh, come on!

904
01:20:40,032 --> 01:20:41,213
It's you.

905
01:20:43,849 --> 01:20:49,655
No, no, no. Please, please.

906
01:20:53,633 --> 01:20:55,347
Kill him.

907
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:04,973
Okay, Dana, come on.

908
01:21:04,974 --> 01:21:06,463
Dana.

909
01:21:09,551 --> 01:21:12,035
Here. It's easier with this.

910
01:22:16,411 --> 01:22:18,182
Look at these.

911
01:22:20,912 --> 01:22:23,014
Five of them.

912
01:22:23,015 --> 01:22:24,877
What are they?

913
01:22:27,753 --> 01:22:29,051
Us.

914
01:22:29,052 --> 01:22:31,662
I should have seen it like you did.

915
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:35,914
This is part of a ritual.

916
01:22:35,915 --> 01:22:38,836
A ritual sacrifice?

917
01:22:41,074 --> 01:22:42,217
Great.

918
01:22:42,218 --> 01:22:48,295
You tie someone to a stone, get a
fancy dagger and a bunch of robes.

919
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:50,751
Is that that complicated?
- No.

920
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:52,104
It's simple.

921
01:22:52,105 --> 01:22:54,816
They don't just want to see us killed.

922
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:59,549
They want to see us punished.

923
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:02,254
Punished for what?

924
01:23:02,255 --> 01:23:04,726
For being young.

925
01:23:10,503 --> 01:23:13,548
It's different in every culture.

926
01:23:13,549 --> 01:23:15,979
And it has changed over the years..

927
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:19,025
but it has always required youth.

928
01:23:19,026 --> 01:23:22,350
There must be at least five.

929
01:23:23,564 --> 01:23:25,336
The whore.

930
01:23:25,337 --> 01:23:27,067
She's corrupted.

931
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:28,707
She dies first.

932
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:31,683
The athlete.

933
01:23:31,684 --> 01:23:34,883
The scholar.

934
01:23:35,983 --> 01:23:37,838
The fool.

935
01:23:37,839 --> 01:23:41,296
All suffer and die at the hands of..

936
01:23:41,297 --> 01:23:43,773
whatever horror they have raised..

937
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:47,625
leaving the last, to live or die..

938
01:23:47,626 --> 01:23:50,038
.. as fate decides.

939
01:23:52,233 --> 01:23:53,799
The virgin.

940
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:56,836
Me?

941
01:23:56,837 --> 01:23:58,892
Virgin?

942
01:23:58,893 --> 01:24:01,296
We work with what we have.

943
01:24:01,297 --> 01:24:04,098
But what if you don't pull it off?

944
01:24:04,099 --> 01:24:05,043
They rise.

945
01:24:05,044 --> 01:24:06,134
Who does?

946
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:09,498
What's beneath us?

947
01:24:09,499 --> 01:24:10,928
The ancient ones.

948
01:24:10,929 --> 01:24:13,461
The gods that used to rule the Earth.

949
01:24:13,462 --> 01:24:17,647
As long as they accept
our sacrifice, they remain below.

950
01:24:17,648 --> 01:24:20,580
But the other rituals have all failed.

951
01:24:24,265 --> 01:24:25,683
The sun is coming up in eight minutes.

952
01:24:25,684 --> 01:24:29,063
If you live to see it,
the world will end.

953
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:31,526
Maybe that's the way it should be.

954
01:24:31,527 --> 01:24:34,925
If you've got to kill all
my friends to survive..

955
01:24:34,926 --> 01:24:37,027
maybe it's time for a change.

956
01:24:37,028 --> 01:24:39,025
We're not talking about change.

957
01:24:39,026 --> 01:24:44,145
We're talking about the agonizing death
of every human soul on the planet.

958
01:24:44,146 --> 01:24:45,890
Including you.

959
01:24:45,891 --> 01:24:47,748
You can die with them..

960
01:24:49,634 --> 01:24:52,123
or you can die for them.

961
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:57,310
Gosh, they're both so enticing.

962
01:25:15,497 --> 01:25:18,396
The whole world, Marty.

963
01:25:18,397 --> 01:25:20,567
Is in your hands, Dana.

964
01:25:20,568 --> 01:25:23,277
There is no other way.

965
01:25:23,278 --> 01:25:26,123
You have to be strong.

966
01:25:26,124 --> 01:25:28,698
Yeah, Dana..

967
01:25:31,033 --> 01:25:32,321
you feeling strong?

968
01:25:34,453 --> 01:25:36,302
I'm sorry.

969
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,332
So am I.

970
01:26:24,396 --> 01:26:25,675
Marty..

971
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:32,288
Marty!

972
01:27:25,437 --> 01:27:27,660
Hey.

973
01:27:30,888 --> 01:27:32,671
You know..

974
01:27:36,402 --> 01:27:38,677
I don't think Curt even has a cousin.

975
01:27:46,101 --> 01:27:48,154
How are you?

976
01:27:51,782 --> 01:27:53,549
Going away.

977
01:27:58,199 --> 01:27:59,646
I'm sorry.

978
01:28:01,575 --> 01:28:03,731
I'm so sorry I almost shot you.

979
01:28:03,732 --> 01:28:07,000
I probably wouldn't have.

980
01:28:07,001 --> 01:28:08,777
Hey, no. No.

981
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:12,561
I totally get it.

982
01:28:25,332 --> 01:28:29,914
I'm sorry I let you get attacked by
a werewolf and then ended the world.

983
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:32,286
No.

984
01:28:33,738 --> 01:28:35,558
Hey, you were right.

985
01:28:37,117 --> 01:28:38,780
Humanity..

986
01:28:45,532 --> 01:28:48,671
It's time to give
someone else a chance.

987
01:29:00,984 --> 01:29:03,219
Giant evil gods.

988
01:29:08,547 --> 01:29:11,893
I wish I could've seen them.

989
01:29:12,094 --> 01:29:15,149
I know.

990
01:29:15,182 --> 01:29:19,238
That would have been a fun weekend.

991
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:22,239
