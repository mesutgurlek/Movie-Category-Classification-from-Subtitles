00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,012
<i>Poor thing, poor thing</i>

163
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,948
<i>They're having this
ball all in masks</i>

164
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:13,717
<i>There's no one she knows there</i>

165
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:15,218
<i>Poor dear, poor thing</i>

166
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,288
<i>She wanders tormented and drinks</i>

167
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:18,656
<i>Poor thing</i>

168
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:20,291
<i>The Judge has repented,
she thinks</i>

169
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:21,592
<i>Poor thing</i>

170
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,561
<i>"Oh, where is Judge Turpin?"</i>
<i>she asks</i>

171
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:27,197
<i>He was there all right</i>

172
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:29,233
<i>Only not so contrite</i>

173
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:35,071
<i>She wasn't no match
for such craft you see</i>

174
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,874
<i>And everyone thought it so droll</i>

175
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:40,761
<i>They figured she had
to be daft you see</i>

176
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:43,947
<i>So all of them stood
there and laughed you see</i>

177
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:45,349
(SCREAMING)
<i>Poor soul</i>

178
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,700
(LAUGHING)

179
00:14:46,768 --> 00:14:48,736
<i>Poor thing...</i>

180
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:50,571
(LAUGHING)

181
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:57,628
(SCREAMING) No!

182
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:02,666
Would no one have mercy on her?

183
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:05,469
So, it is you,

184
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:08,005
Benjamin Barker?

185
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:11,458
Where is Lucy?

186
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:15,011
Where is my wife?

187
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,647
She poisoned herself.

188
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:22,135
Arsenic, from the apothecary
around the corner.

189
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:25,556
Tried to stop her, but she
wouldn't listen to me.

190
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,161
And he's got your daughter.

191
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:34,665
He?

192
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:37,418
Judge Turpin?

193
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:41,788
Adopted her. Like his own.

194
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:46,093
Fifteen years.

195
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:49,646
I've sweated in a living
hell on a false charge.

196
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:56,303
Fifteen years dreaming I might
come home to a wife and child.

197
00:15:57,905 --> 00:15:59,606
Well, I can't say
the years have been

198
00:15:59,674 --> 00:16:01,308
particularly kind
to you, Mr. Barker.

199
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:03,910
No. Not Barker.

200
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:06,830
That man is dead.

201
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:10,950
It's Todd now. Sweeney Todd.

202
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,988
And he will have his revenge.

203
00:16:47,989 --> 00:16:49,889
Come in.

204
00:16:49,957 --> 00:16:52,276
Nothing to be afraid of, love.

205
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:42,192
When they came for the girl,
I hid them.

206
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,928
Could've sold them, but I didn't.

207
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:59,727
Those handles is chased
silver, ain't they?

208
00:18:01,546 --> 00:18:03,864
Silver. Yes.

209
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,960
<i>These are my friends</i>

210
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:22,666
<i>See how they glisten</i>

211
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:27,437
<i>See this one shine</i>

212
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:32,292
<i>How he smiles in the light</i>

213
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:35,696
<i>My friend</i>

214
00:18:35,763 --> 00:18:39,983
<i>My faithful friend</i>

215
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,389
<i>Speak to me, friend</i>

216
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:50,994
<i>Whisper, I'll listen</i>

217
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,398
<i>I know, I know</i>

218
00:18:55,734 --> 00:19:02,705
<i>You've been locked out
of sight all these years</i>

219
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:07,010
<i>Like me, my friend</i>

220
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:11,231
<i>Well, I've come home</i>

221
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:15,485
<i>To find you waiting</i>

222
00:19:16,754 --> 00:19:19,273
<i>Home</i>

223
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,377
<i>And we're together</i>

224
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,947
<i>And we'll do wonders</i>

225
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:31,951
<i>Won't we?</i>

226
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:35,889
<i>You there, my friend</i>

227
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:37,924
<i>I'm your friend, too, Mr. Todd</i>

228
00:19:37,992 --> 00:19:39,893
<i>Come, let me hold you</i>

229
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,695
<i>If you only knew, Mr. Todd</i>

230
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:43,430
<i>Now, with a sigh</i>

231
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:45,165
<i>Oh, Mr. Todd</i>

232
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:48,535
<i>You're warm in my hand
You grow warm in my hand</i>

233
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:50,604
<i>My friend</i>

234
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:52,539
<i>You've come home</i>

235
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:54,441
<i>My clever friend</i>

236
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:58,311
<i>Always had a fondness
for you, I did</i>

237
00:19:58,379 --> 00:20:01,098
<i>Rest now, my friends</i>

238
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:03,300
<i>Never you fear, Mr. Todd</i>

239
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,469
<i>Soon I'll unfold you</i>

240
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:06,903
<i>You can move in here, Mr. Todd</i>

241
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:08,305
<i>Soon you'll know</i>

242
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:14,911
<i>BOTH: Splendors you never
have dreamed all your days</i>

243
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:16,546
<i>Will be yours</i>

244
00:20:16,614 --> 00:20:19,215
<i>My lucky friends</i>

245
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:21,317
<i>I'm your friend
and now you're mine</i>

246
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,386
<i>Till now your shine...</i>

247
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:25,588
<i>Don't they shine beautiful?</i>

248
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,758
<i>...was merely silver</i>

249
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:30,494
<i>Silver's good enough for me</i>

250
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:33,363
<i>Friends, you shall drip rubies</i>

251
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:36,333
<i>Mr. T</i>

252
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:41,320
<i>You'll soon drip precious</i>

253
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:46,109
<i>Rubies</i>

254
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:55,184
Leave me.

255
00:21:08,682 --> 00:21:13,353
At last, my arm is complete again.

256
00:21:56,697 --> 00:21:57,714

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,356
<i>How is it you sing?</i>

260
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:25,225
<i>How can you jubilate</i>

261
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:27,444
<i>Sitting in cages</i>

262
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:30,747
<i>Never taking wing?</i>

00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,100
<i>Outside the sky waits</i>

00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:36,336
<i>Beckoning, beckoning</i>

<i>Just beyond the bars</i>

00:22:40,741 --> 00:22:42,542
<i>How can you remain</i>

267
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,943
<i>Staring at the rain</i>

268
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:47,947
<i>Maddened by the stars?</i>

269
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:54,204
<i>How is it you sing anything?</i>

270
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:58,274
<i>How is it you sing?</i>

271
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:14,491

<i>Not even my lark</i>

Thank you, sir!

00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:28,614
Ma'am?

289
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,202
Could you tell me
whose house this is?

290
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,138
That's the great Judge
Turpin's house, that is.

291
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:38,608
And the young lady
who resides there?

292
00:24:38,676 --> 00:24:42,829
Oh, that's Johanna,
his pretty little ward.

293
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:46,866
Keeps her snug, he does.
All locked up.

294
00:24:46,934 --> 00:24:49,369
So don't you go trespassing there,

295
00:24:49,436 --> 00:24:51,688
or it's a good whipping for you,

296
00:24:51,755 --> 00:24:55,758
or any other young man
with mischief on his mind.

297

00:25:12,193 --> 00:25:16,396
<i>Johanna</i>

301
00:25:16,463 --> 00:25:20,583
<i>I feel you</i>

302
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:24,587
<i>I was half convinced I'd waken</i>

303
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:28,658
<i>Satisfied enough to dream you</i>

304
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:34,864
<i>Happily I was mistaken, Johanna</i>

305
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:40,103
<i>I'll steal you</i>

306

Come in, lad. Come in.

309
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,938
You were looking for
Hyde Park, you say?

310
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,689
Yes.

311
00:26:16,757 --> 00:26:20,293
It's very large on the map,
but I keep getting lost.

312
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:23,095
Sit down, lad, sit down.

313
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:25,465
It's embarrassing for a
sailor to lose his bearings,

314
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,801
but there you are.

315
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:34,006
A sailor?

316
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:38,227
Yes, sir. The<i>Bountiful,
out of Plymouth.</i>

317
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:42,815
A sailor must know the
ways of the world, yes?

318
00:26:42,883 --> 00:26:46,386
Must be practiced in
the ways of the world.

319
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:48,605
Would you say you
were practiced, boy?

320
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,307
Sir?

321
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:51,975
Oh, yes.

322
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:56,662
Such practices.

323
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:00,283
The geishas of Japan.

324
00:27:00,351 --> 00:27:02,451
The concubines of Siam.

325
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,754

Yes. I'm sorry.

This girl has a guardian

she dropped this.

Surely a sign that Johanna

If I could keep her here
just for an hour or two,

He didn't have your nice

Why should you?

00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,990
What do you say to that, now,

So, how'd you end up with
that dreadful Italian?

655
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:47,389
Got me from the workhouse.

656
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:49,641
Been there since I was born.

657
00:48:50,276 --> 00:48:51,493
Oh, God!

658
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,613
He's got an appointment with his tailor!
If he's late, he'll blame me!

659
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:55,980
Wait!

660
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:05,173
Signor! You got an appointment!

661
00:49:10,546 --> 00:49:12,247
Signor Pirelli's been called away.

662
00:49:12,315 --> 00:49:15,066
Better run after him.

663
00:49:15,134 --> 00:49:19,521
No, sir. I should stay here,
or it'll be a lashing.

664
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:22,440
He's a great one for the lashings.

665

So,

666
00:49:30,699 --> 00:49:32,584
Mrs. Lovett gave
you a pie, did she?

667
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:34,886
She's a real lady.

668
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:37,188
That she is.

669
00:49:42,011 --> 00:49:44,663
But if I know a growing boy,

670
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,064
there's still room
for more pie, eh?

671
00:49:47,132 --> 00:49:49,635
Yes, sir.

672
00:49:49,702 --> 00:49:52,521
Then why don't you wait for
your master downstairs?

673
00:49:52,588 --> 00:49:54,790
Be another pie in it
for you, I'm sure.

674
00:49:54,857 --> 00:49:56,992
No, I should stay here.

675
00:49:59,712 --> 00:50:03,614
Tell you what, why don't
you tell Mrs. Lovett

676
00:50:03,682 --> 00:50:07,152

a nice big tot of gin.

before this bench.

680

Though it is my earnest wish ever
to temper justice with mercy,

681
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:31,069
your persistent dedication
to a life of crime

682
00:51:31,137 --> 00:51:34,839
is an abomination
before God and man.

683
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:38,393
I therefore sentence you to hang
by the neck until you're dead.

684
00:51:38,461 --> 00:51:41,479
And may the Lord have
mercy on your soul.

Thank you, Your Honor.

688
00:51:55,928 --> 00:51:57,596
Just the sentence we wanted.

689
00:51:57,663 --> 00:51:59,331
Was he guilty?

690
00:51:59,398 --> 00:52:00,698
Well, if he didn't do it,

691
00:52:00,766 --> 00:52:03,101
he's surely done something
to warrant a hanging.

692
00:52:03,169 --> 00:52:04,536
What man has not?

693
00:52:04,604 --> 00:52:05,903
Sorry?

694

No matter. Come.

In order to shield her from
the evils of this world,

698
00:52:22,488 --> 00:52:25,857
I have decided to marry
my dear Johanna.

Oh! Sir, happy news indeed.

700
00:52:28,427 --> 00:52:30,528
Strange though,

701
00:52:30,596 --> 00:52:32,497
when I offered myself to her,

702
00:52:32,565 --> 00:52:36,852
she showed a certain reluctance.

<i>You're looking less

<i>Some eau de cologne
to grace, my lord</i>

Take me to him.

His name is Todd, my lord,

725
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:41,683
and he is the very last
word in barbering.

You ought to slow down a bit, lad.

It'll go straight to your head.

728

They used to give it to us in the
workhouse so as we could sleep.

729

in that place, ma'am.

it's a different matter then.

you'd lost your marbles.

Well, waste not, want not.

So, what are we gonna
do about the boy then?

752
00:55:22,067 --> 00:55:24,418
Send him up.

753
00:55:24,486 --> 00:55:27,489
Oh, we don't need to worry about him.
He's a simple thing.

754

Send him up!

enough for today.

00:59:01,053 --> 00:59:03,388
A pretty little rosebud.

810
00:59:03,455 --> 00:59:05,390
Pretty as her mother?

811
00:59:06,425 --> 00:59:09,026
What? What was that?

812
00:59:09,094 --> 00:59:13,414
Nothing, sir. Nothing.
May we proceed?

813
00:59:15,117 --> 00:59:17,251
<i>Pretty women</i>

814
00:59:17,319 --> 00:59:19,621
<i>Fascinating</i>

<i>Dancing</i>

<i>Pretty women!</i>

818
00:59:27,796 --> 00:59:30,197
<i>Are a wonder</i>

819
00:59:30,265 --> 00:59:32,767
<i>Pretty women</i>

<i>Sitting in the window or</i>

<i>Standing on the stair</i>

<i>Something in them</i>

<i>Cheers the air</i>

<i>Silhouetted</i>

826
01:00:00,996 --> 01:00:03,414
<i>Stay within you</i>

827
01:00:03,481 --> 01:00:06,133
<i>Glancing!</i>

828
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:08,720
<i>Stay forever</i>

829
01:00:08,722 --> 01:00:11,239
<i>Breathing lightly</i>

<i>Pretty women</i>

Blowing out their candles or</i>

<i>Combing out their hair</i>

<i>Combing out their hair</i>

835
01:00:24,269 --> 01:00:26,003
<i>Then they leave</i>

836
01:00:26,071 --> 01:00:29,490
<i>Even when they leave...
Even when they leave you and vanish...</i>

837
01:00:29,557 --> 01:00:32,460
<i>...they still...
...they somehow can still remain...</i>

838
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:35,396
<i>...are there, they're there</i>

839
01:00:35,464 --> 01:00:38,032
<i>...there with you</i>

840
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,484
<i>BOTH: Pretty women</i>

841
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,831
<i>At their mirrors
In their gardens</i>

<i>BOTH: How they make a man sing</i>

<i>Proof of heaven</i>

01:00:51,196 --> 01:00:53,564
<i>As you're living</i>

01:00:53,632 --> 01:00:56,066
<i>Pretty women, sir!</i>

01:00:56,134 --> 01:00:58,268
<i>Pretty women, yes!</i>

<i>Pretty women, pretty women</i>

851
01:01:01,873 --> 01:01:03,474
Mr. Todd! I've seen Johanna

852
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:06,227
and she said she'd
leave with me tonight.

853
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:09,964
You.

854
01:01:10,031 --> 01:01:14,268
There is indeed a higher power
to warn me thus in time.

855
01:01:14,336 --> 01:01:16,270
Johanna elope with you?

856
01:01:18,006 --> 01:01:19,373
I'll make sure that neither you

857
01:01:19,441 --> 01:01:22,843
nor any other man shall
ever set eyes on her again.

858
01:01:23,178 --> 01:01:24,678
As for you, barber,

859
01:01:24,746 --> 01:01:27,298
it's all too clear
what company you keep.

860
01:01:27,365 --> 01:01:29,500
Service them well and
hold their custom,

861
01:01:29,568 --> 01:01:31,402
for you'll have none of mine.

862
01:01:31,469 --> 01:01:33,738
Mr. Todd. You have to help me.
Out.

863
01:01:33,806 --> 01:01:35,139
Mr. Todd, please.
Out.

864
01:01:35,207 --> 01:01:37,191
Mr. Todd!
Out!

865
01:01:42,914 --> 01:01:45,399
All this shouting and running about.
What's happened?

866
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:46,601
I had him.

867
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:49,420
The sailor busted in, I know. And then I
saw them both running down the stairs.

868
01:01:49,488 --> 01:01:50,905
I had him!

869
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:53,141
<i>His throat was
bare beneath my hand</i>

870
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:56,077
There, there, dear. Calm down.
No, I had him!

871
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:57,312
<i>His throat was there</i>

872
01:01:57,379 --> 01:01:58,612
<i>And he'll never come again!</i>

873
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,214
<i>Easy now</i>

874
01:02:00,282 --> 01:02:01,733
<i>Hush, love, hush</i>

875
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,051
<i>I'll keep telling you
When?</i>

876
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:05,987
<i>What's your rush?
Why did I wait?</i>

877
01:02:06,054 --> 01:02:08,105
<i>You told me to wait!</i>

878
01:02:08,172 --> 01:02:10,057
<i>Now he'll never come again!</i>

879
01:02:12,494 --> 01:02:14,561
<i>There's a hole in the world
like a great black pit</i>

880
01:02:14,629 --> 01:02:16,497
<i>And it's filled with people
who are filled with shit</i>

881
01:02:16,564 --> 01:02:19,717
<i>And the vermin of
the world inhabit it</i>

882
01:02:19,785 --> 01:02:22,336
<i>But not for long!</i>

883
01:02:25,407 --> 01:02:29,677
<i>They all deserve to die</i>

884
01:02:29,744 --> 01:02:32,112
<i>Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett</i>

885
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:34,182
<i>Tell you why</i>

886
01:02:34,249 --> 01:02:37,051
<i>Because in all of the whole
human race, Mrs. Lovett</i>

887
01:02:37,118 --> 01:02:39,487
<i>There are two kinds
of men and only two</i>

888
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,689
<i>There's the one staying put
In his proper place</i>

889
01:02:41,756 --> 01:02:42,990
<i>And the one with his foot</i>

890
01:02:43,058 --> 01:02:44,158
<i>In the other one's face</i>

891
01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:46,360
<i>Look at me, Mrs. Lovett,
look at you!</i>

892
01:02:46,428 --> 01:02:50,798
<i>No, we all deserve to die</i>

893
01:02:50,865 --> 01:02:53,200
<i>Even you, Mrs. Lovett</i>

894
01:02:53,268 --> 01:02:55,352
<i>Even I</i>

895
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:58,188
<i>Because the lives of the
wicked should be made brief</i>

896
01:02:58,256 --> 01:03:00,491
<i>For the rest of us,
death will be a relief</i>

897
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:04,895
<i>We all deserve to die</i>

898
01:03:04,963 --> 01:03:11,134
<i>And I'll never see Johanna</i>

899
01:03:11,202 --> 01:03:17,374
<i>No, I'll never hug my girl to me</i>

900
01:03:17,442 --> 01:03:19,209
<i>Finished!</i>

901
01:03:20,545 --> 01:03:24,281
All right!
You, sir. How about a shave?

902
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:28,151
Come and visit your
good friend Sweeney.

903
01:03:28,219 --> 01:03:29,653
You, sir, too, sir.

904
01:03:29,721 --> 01:03:31,088
Welcome to the grave!

905
01:03:31,155 --> 01:03:35,192
<i>I will have vengeance</i>

906
01:03:35,259 --> 01:03:40,430
<i>I will have salvation</i>

907
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:43,367
Who, sir?

908
01:03:43,434 --> 01:03:44,768
You, sir? No one's in the chair.

909
01:03:44,836 --> 01:03:46,136
Come on, come on.

910
01:03:46,204 --> 01:03:49,807
Sweeney's waiting!
I want you bleeders.

911
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:51,542
You, sir! Anybody!

912
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:53,210
Gentlemen, now don't be shy!

913
01:03:53,277 --> 01:03:58,983
<i>Not one man, no, nor ten men</i>

914
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:05,523
<i>Nor a hundred can assuage me</i>

915
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:09,994
<i>I will have you</i>

916
01:04:10,061 --> 01:04:11,996
<i>And I will get him back</i>

917
01:04:12,063 --> 01:04:13,631
<i>Even as he gloats</i>

918
01:04:13,698 --> 01:04:17,034
<i>In the meantime I'll practice
on less honorable throats</i>

919
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:23,407
<i>And my Lucy lies in ashes</i>

920
01:04:23,474 --> 01:04:30,147
<i>And I'll never see my girl again</i>

921
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:33,751
<i>But the work waits!</i>

922
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:38,321
<i>I'm alive at last!</i>

923
01:04:38,389 --> 01:04:44,512
<i>And I'm full of joy!</i>

924
01:04:51,136 --> 01:04:54,137
That's all very well, but what
are we gonna do about him?

925
01:04:58,626 --> 01:04:59,843
Hello?

926
01:05:03,398 --> 01:05:05,115
Do you hear me?

927
01:05:08,069 --> 01:05:09,602
Come on.

928
01:05:10,338 --> 01:05:12,672
You great useless thing.

929
01:05:18,846 --> 01:05:20,313
Sit down.

930
01:05:27,321 --> 01:05:28,321
(SIGHS)

931
01:05:40,335 --> 01:05:42,151
There. Drink it down.

932
01:05:44,221 --> 01:05:47,874
Now, we got a body
moldering away upstairs.

933
01:05:47,942 --> 01:05:50,777
Now, what do you intend we
should do about that, then?

934
01:05:50,929 --> 01:05:53,230
Later on when it's dark,

935
01:05:53,298 --> 01:05:56,633
we'll take it to some
secret place and bury it.

936
01:05:56,701 --> 01:05:59,570
Oh, yeah. Course we could do that.

937
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:03,890
Don't suppose he's
got any relatives

938
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:05,993
that's gonna come poking
around looking for him.

939
01:06:11,282 --> 01:06:14,301
<i>Seems a downright shame</i>

940
01:06:14,368 --> 01:06:15,852
Shame?

941
01:06:17,271 --> 01:06:19,539
<i>Seems an awful waste</i>

942
01:06:21,608 --> 01:06:23,994
<i>Such a nice plump frame</i>

943
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:25,479
<i>What's his name has</i>

944
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:28,398
<i>Had, has</i>

945
01:06:28,466 --> 01:06:31,234
<i>Nor it can't be traced</i>

946
01:06:32,303 --> 01:06:34,955
<i>Business needs a lift</i>

947
01:06:35,723 --> 01:06:38,925
<i>Debts to be erased</i>

948
01:06:38,992 --> 01:06:42,278
<i>Think of it as thrift, as a gift</i>

949
01:06:42,947 --> 01:06:45,615
If you get my drift.

950
01:06:45,817 --> 01:06:49,086
<i>Seems an awful waste</i>

951
01:06:51,372 --> 01:06:54,741
<i>I mean, with the price
of meat what it is</i>

952
01:06:54,808 --> 01:06:56,659
<i>When you get it, if you get it</i>

953
01:06:57,178 --> 01:06:58,278
Ah!

954
01:06:58,346 --> 01:06:59,713
<i>Good, you got it</i>

955
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:03,683
<i>Take, for instance
Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop</i>

956
01:07:03,751 --> 01:07:07,887
<i>Business never better using
only pussycats and toast</i>

957
01:07:07,955 --> 01:07:12,092
<i>Now a pussy's good for maybe
six or seven at the most</i>

958
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:13,844
<i>And I'm sure they can't
compare as far as taste</i>

959
01:07:13,911 --> 01:07:15,595
<i>Mrs. Lovett,
what a charming notion</i>

960
01:07:15,662 --> 01:07:16,996
<i>Eminently practical</i>

961
01:07:17,064 --> 01:07:18,932
<i>And yet appropriate as always
Well, it does seem a waste</i>

962
01:07:18,999 --> 01:07:22,001
<i>Mrs. Lovett, how I've lived without you
All these years I'll never know!</i>

963
01:07:22,003 --> 01:07:26,089
<i>Think about it. Lots of other
gentlemen'll soon be coming for a shave
How delectable! Also undetectable</i>

964
01:07:26,157 --> 01:07:28,358
<i>Won't they? Think of all them...
How choice! How rare!</i>

965
01:07:28,425 --> 01:07:31,828
<i>pies!
For what's the sound
of the world out there?</i>

966
01:07:31,896 --> 01:07:34,197
<i>What, Mr. Todd
What, Mr. Todd</i>

967
01:07:34,265 --> 01:07:35,431
<i>What is that sound?</i>

968
01:07:35,499 --> 01:07:38,735
<i>Those crunching noises
pervading the air?</i>

969
01:07:38,802 --> 01:07:40,003
<i>Yes, Mr. Todd</i>

970
01:07:40,071 --> 01:07:41,805
<i>Yes, Mr. Todd, yes, all around</i>

971
01:07:41,873 --> 01:07:45,124
<i>It's man devouring man, my dear</i>

972
01:07:45,192 --> 01:07:50,230
<i>And who are we
to deny it in here?</i>

973
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:56,636
These are desperate times,
Mrs. Lovett.

974
01:07:56,703 --> 01:07:59,839
And desperate measures
are called for.

975
01:07:59,907 --> 01:08:03,560
Here we are, hot out of the oven.

976
01:08:04,244 --> 01:08:05,561
What is that?

977
01:08:05,629 --> 01:08:07,180
<i>It's priest</i>

978
01:08:07,248 --> 01:08:08,699
<i>Have a little priest</i>

979
01:08:08,766 --> 01:08:10,466
<i>Is it really good?</i>

980
01:08:10,534 --> 01:08:12,202
<i>Sir, it's too good, at least</i>

981
01:08:12,269 --> 01:08:15,572
<i>Then again they don't
commit sins of the flesh</i>

982
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:17,540
<i>So it's pretty fresh</i>

983
01:08:19,177 --> 01:08:20,860
<i>Awful lot of fat</i>

984
01:08:20,928 --> 01:08:22,462
<i>Only where it sat</i>

985
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:26,048
<i>Haven't you got poet
or something like that?</i>

986
01:08:26,116 --> 01:08:28,535
<i>No, you see the
trouble with poet is</i>

987
01:08:28,602 --> 01:08:30,970
<i>How do you know it's deceased?</i>

988
01:08:31,038 --> 01:08:33,106
<i>Try the priest</i>

989
01:08:42,049 --> 01:08:43,950
Lawyer's rather nice.

990
01:08:44,018 --> 01:08:45,852
<i>If it's for a price</i>

991
01:08:45,919 --> 01:08:48,388
<i>Order something else,
though, to follow</i>

992
01:08:48,456 --> 01:08:50,857
<i>Since no one should
swallow it twice</i>

993
01:08:50,924 --> 01:08:52,659
<i>Anything that's lean?</i>

994
01:08:52,726 --> 01:08:54,827
<i>Well, then,
if you're British and loyal</i>

995
01:08:54,895 --> 01:08:57,697
<i>You might enjoy Royal Marine</i>

996
01:08:57,765 --> 01:08:59,449
<i>Anyway, it's clean</i>

997
01:08:59,516 --> 01:09:02,718
<i>Though, of course it
tastes of wherever it's been</i>

998
01:09:02,786 --> 01:09:06,222
<i>Is that squire on the fire?</i>

999
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:08,258
<i>Mercy no, sir, look closer</i>

1000
01:09:08,326 --> 01:09:09,759
<i>You'll notice it's grocer</i>

1001
01:09:09,827 --> 01:09:11,161
<i>Looks thicker</i>

1002
01:09:11,228 --> 01:09:12,862
<i>More like vicar</i>

1003
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:14,931
<i>No, it has to be grocer</i>

1004
01:09:14,999 --> 01:09:16,232
<i>It's green</i>

1005

<i>Do a lot of relatives favors</i>

1008
01:09:26,344 --> 01:09:30,280
<i>Is those below
serving those up above</i>

1009
01:09:30,348 --> 01:09:31,581
<i>Everybody shaves</i>

1010
01:09:31,648 --> 01:09:33,048
<i>So there should be
plenty of flavors</i>

1011
01:09:33,084 --> 01:09:36,218
<i>How gratifying for once to know</i>

1012
01:09:36,286 --> 01:09:41,774
<i>BOTH: That those above
will serve those down below!</i>

1013
01:09:48,098 --> 01:09:49,165
What is that?

1014
01:09:49,233 --> 01:09:50,733
<i>It's fop</i>

1015
01:09:50,801 --> 01:09:52,719
<i>Finest in the shop</i>

1016
01:09:52,786 --> 01:09:54,304
<i>Or we have some shepherd's pie</i>

1017
01:09:54,372 --> 01:09:57,474
<i>Peppered with actual
shepherd on top</i>

<i>And I've just begun</i>

1019

<i>Here's the politician, so oily</i>

1020
01:10:01,962 --> 01:10:04,580
<i>It's served with
a doily, have one</i>

1021
01:10:04,648 --> 01:10:06,315
<i>Put it on a bun</i>

1022
01:10:06,383 --> 01:10:09,652
<i>Well, you never know
if it's going to run</i>

1023
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,889
<i>Try the friar, fried, it's drier</i>

1024
01:10:12,957 --> 01:10:15,058
<i>No, the clergy is really</i>

1025
01:10:15,126 --> 01:10:16,759
<i>Too coarse and too mealy</i>

1026
01:10:16,828 --> 01:10:18,295
<i>Then actor</i>

1027
01:10:18,362 --> 01:10:19,996
<i>It's compacter</i>

1028
01:10:20,064 --> 01:10:23,033
<i>But always arrives overdone</i>

1029
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:26,703
I'll come again when you
have judge on the menu.

1030
01:10:32,893 --> 01:10:36,463
<i>Have charity towards
the world, my pet</i>

1031
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:39,482
<i>Yes, yes, I know, my love</i>

1032
01:10:39,549 --> 01:10:43,186
<i>We'll take the customers
that we can get</i>

<i>High-born and low, my love</i>

1034
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:49,025
<i>We'll not discriminate
great from small</i>

1035
01:10:49,093 --> 01:10:51,227
<i>No, we'll serve anyone</i>

1036
01:10:51,295 --> 01:10:52,862
<i>We'll serve anyone
Meaning anyone</i>

1037
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:57,100
<i>BOTH: And to anyone at all!</i>

1038
01:11:16,537 --> 01:11:18,871
So, it's true.

1039
01:11:18,939 --> 01:11:23,843
Sir, a gentleman knocks before
entering a lady's room.

1040
01:11:23,895 --> 01:11:26,546
Indeed he does, but I see no lady.

1041
01:11:29,383 --> 01:11:31,951
I told myself the sailor was lying,

1042
01:11:32,019 --> 01:11:36,506
that my Johanna would never
betray me, never hurt me so.

1043
01:11:36,574 --> 01:11:39,309
Sir, I will leave this place.

1044
01:11:40,494 --> 01:11:43,196
I think that only appropriate

1045
01:11:43,264 --> 01:11:47,500
since you no longer find
my company to your liking.

1046
01:11:50,003 --> 01:11:53,022
We shall provide you
with new lodgings.

1047
01:11:55,776 --> 01:11:59,595
Until this moment
I have spared the rod.

1048
01:12:00,831 --> 01:12:04,650
But the ungrateful child
has broken my heart.

1049
01:12:06,069 --> 01:12:08,154
When you've learned to
appreciate what you have,

1050
01:12:08,172 --> 01:12:09,889
perhaps we shall meet again.

1051
01:12:09,956 --> 01:12:11,590
Until then

1052
01:12:13,093 --> 01:12:15,945
think on your sins.

1053
01:12:23,153 --> 01:12:24,520
No!

01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:36,582
Tell me or I swear I'll...

1059
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:39,218
You'd kill me, boy? Here I stand!

1060

Mr. T?

1285
01:27:39,485 --> 01:27:41,486
Do you know where
the Old Bailey is?

1286
01:27:41,554 --> 01:27:43,488
Yes, sir.
Not that I ever been there.

1287
01:27:43,556 --> 01:27:45,624
Take this there.

1288
01:27:45,692 --> 01:27:47,793
Seek out a Judge Turpin.
Repeat that.

1289
01:27:47,861 --> 01:27:50,262
Go to Old Bailey.
Find Judge Turpin.

1290
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:51,863
You put that into his hands.

1291
01:27:51,931 --> 01:27:53,749
Only to him, you understand?

1292
01:27:53,817 --> 01:27:55,134
Yes, sir.

1293
01:27:55,201 --> 01:27:57,403
And while I'm out, do you mind if
I stop by the grocer just to pick...

1294
01:27:57,470 --> 01:28:00,138
No. You're not to stop,
you're not to speak.

1295
01:28:00,206 --> 01:28:01,507
You're to deliver the letter.

1296
01:28:01,574 --> 01:28:02,841

1297
01:28:02,909 --> 01:28:04,476
Yes, sir.

1298
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:36,091
Where you been, lad?

1299
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:38,494
We had quite the
rush at dinner time.

1300
01:28:38,561 --> 01:28:40,945
Me poor bones is ready to drop.

1301
01:28:41,013 --> 01:28:43,281
Mr. Todd sent me on an errand.

1302
01:28:43,349 --> 01:28:44,482
And on the way back,

1303
01:28:44,551 --> 01:28:47,352
I went by the workhouse,
just to take a look.

1304
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:51,256
And I was thinking, but for
you, I'd be there now.

1305
01:28:52,324 --> 01:28:54,192
Or someplace worse.

1306
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:56,244
Seems like the good
Lord sent you for me.

1307
01:28:56,312 --> 01:28:59,731
Oh, love,
I feel quite the same way.

1308
01:28:59,799 --> 01:29:01,734
Listen to me, please.

1309
01:29:01,801 --> 01:29:04,085
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

1310
01:29:04,153 --> 01:29:07,339
Say, if there were someone around,

1311
01:29:08,191 --> 01:29:10,492
someone bad?

1312
01:29:10,559 --> 01:29:13,177
Only you didn't know it.

1313
01:29:13,245 --> 01:29:14,329

1314

Here.

No, it's not. Just something
Mr. T gave me for my birthday.

That proves it! We gotta go, ma'am.

They go right down to the
sewers, and the smells come up.

Always a few rats gone
home to Jesus down there.

Now, this'll be the bake oven.

Three dozen at a time.

Always be sure the door is
closed properly, like this.
