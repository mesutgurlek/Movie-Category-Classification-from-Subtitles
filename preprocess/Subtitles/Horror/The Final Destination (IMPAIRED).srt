Say, you're the guy
who stopped that mall fire, aren't you?

944
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,325
You saved a lot of lives, man.

945
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:02,163
I was just at the right place
at the right time.

946
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,164
Mm-hm. Sometimes that's all it takes.

947
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,674
Okay, that was really weird.

-Oh, thanks. I actually just got it.
-Did you? Where?

LORI: Yeah. There's a place
right next to Brevet’s. It just opened.

952
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:25,520
JANET: Brevet’s?
LORI: Yeah, it's in that shopping centre.

953
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,521
There's a grocery store and a card shop'
and then there's a--

954
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:31,326
-It's like a little accessories store.
JANET: Oh, yeah.

955
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:34,327
LORI: It's super cute. If you want one
of these purses, they have it in plaid.

956
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,766
JANET: Ha, ha, is that the only other one?
-Yeah.

They only made two?

Hey, uh, space cadet,
you want to come back down to Earth?

961
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:07,062
What if we didn't change anything?

962
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,731
-What are you talking about?
-Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

963
