1
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,800
You were lucky. You just have
mild hypothermia and some frostbite.

2
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,520
What were you doing out in the cold?

3
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,080
I couldn't find the toilet.

4
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,160
If you can't find the
toilet, Marie, just ask me.

5
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,800
- How's the old lady?
- She just gets a little frostbitten.

6
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,760
It looks nice.

7
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,400
Are you with the closure committee?
Celebrating that we're being shut down?

8
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,520
No. Not everyone's a
bitter old man, Hermann.

9
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,840
- I'm celebrating our time together.
- Some of us might want out.

10
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,360
What a fuss.

11
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,160
Hey, Camilla. Do you think Ole
would want some of this scrap?

12
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,440
No, just throw it out.
We have a garage full of stuff.

13
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,240
Okay.

14
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,160
Hi.

15
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,120
You're being friendly.
How come?

16
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,360
<i>Ole, are you there?</i>

17
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,240
Ole here.

18
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:24,160
<i>I've got a message about an
abandoned car near Stehøtinn.</i>

19
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,360
I'll check it out.

20
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,960
Where were we?
Heard anything more about the job?

21
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,440
I got an offer at Ullevål,
and I said yes.

22
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:48,160
I know we haven't finished talking
about it, but it just slipped out.

23
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,960
- Say something, please.
- It's best I check on that car.

24
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Thanks.

25
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,160
Two to three days, judging by the snow.
Has anyone been reported missing?

26
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,440
No, there aren't any
cabins around here.

27
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,640
At least you have the
license number. Bye.

28
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,040
Damn!

29
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,480
I wrote to him yesterday.

30
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,080
His mother called and asked
if he could stay the night.

31
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,240
- How is it?
- It itches.

32
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:53,920
Itches? That's good.
That means it's healing.

33
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,600
Trouble with Ole?

34
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,840
You know, Ole. He thrives
in an igloo in the mountains.

35
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,680
I'm more for two rooms
and a kitchen in the city.

36
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,520
There's snow and trees in Oslo, too.

37
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,240
Have you tried to tell him that?

38
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,240
It's Ole.

39
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,160
Hi.

40
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,400
I don't see any external injuries,
but there's a lot of blood.

41
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,000
It's not mine.

42
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,360
Right.

43
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,560
Exactly.

44
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,800
You say that you and four friends
were on a snowboarding trip?

45
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,720
A broken leg.

46
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:36,960
So you broke into an abandoned
hotel to find shelter.

47
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,240
And at the hotel your
friends were killed.

48
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,520
And he that did it was a kind of ...

49
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,080
... abominable snowman
who lived in the basement.

50
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,640
And now he and your friends
are at the bottom of a deep crevasse.

51
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:08,880
Why did you bring this?

52
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,080
In case he came back, I thought.

53
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,920
What do you think?

54
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,840
- Is she sane?
- It's a bit early to say.

55
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,320
We'll go up and check, in any case.

56
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,720
Kim, get the snowmobile and climbing
equipment. Arne, get the snow cat.

57
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,440
- Sverre, stay here and keep watch.
- Keep watch?

58
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,280
Keep an eye on her until we
know what this is all about.

59
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,520
Ole, will you help?

60
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:57,600
- Sure.
- Good.

61
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,320
Bye.

62
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:15,720
See you at the garage.

63
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,560
That's ok. I'll heat
it up in the microwave.

64
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,280
Ragnhild, will you record
"Around Norway" for me?

65
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,440
Is it true, you think?

66
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:43,400
We'll soon find out.

67
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:47,840
Could you have a chat with her?
She needs someone to talk to.

68
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,080
- Shouldn't we call someone?
- I called, and they're coming tomorrow.

69
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,720
Until then, I think you're
the best option, Camilla.

70
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,480
Sorry. I just thought
I'd take your temperature.

71
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,240
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

72
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,960
It's getting better.

73
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,960
I brought you some soup.

74
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:10,360
I made it myself.

75
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,680
I know how hospital food tastes.

76
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,680
Yes.

77
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,800
- Please let us know if ...
- Yes.

78
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,960
- Hi.
- Hi.

79
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,800
Well ...

80
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:08,440
<i>- I couldn't find the toilet.
- Let me help you.</i>

81
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,000
Kim?

82
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,840
<i>How much more time do you need?</i>

83
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,560
<i>The wind's starting to blow.</i>

84
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,560
I'm done now.

85
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,800
Are you very sick?

86
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,600
No, not really.

87
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,520
Neither am I. I just have to
wait for Mom to come and get me.

88
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:32,680
- Did you break your arm?
- Yep.

89
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,080
- Did it hurt a lot?
- Yes, but I didn't cry.

90
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,280
- Want to try my cool fighting game?
- No, thanks ...

91
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,880
I'm a little tired right now.

92
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,040
Ok.

93
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,720
Hey...?
What's your name?

94
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,400
Daniel.

95
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:13,520
I'm Jannicke. Maybe we can play
a little tomorrow, if you want to.

96
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:31,600
That was the last.
Let's pack up and go back.

97
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,160
You and Johan stay here.
We have to seal off this area.

98
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,440
Here?

99
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,400
That's what the crime lab
people would want, you know?

100
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:48,320
And when you're done with that,
check out the hotel. I'm sorry.

101
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,680
Sorry.

102
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,680
<i>- Criminal police, this is security.
- This is Einar Stolen, the sheriff.</i>

103
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,920
We need some help. We've found five
bodies in a deep crevasse. Suspected murder.

104
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,320
<i>- Did you track the culprit?
- Yes. He's as dead as the others.</i>

105
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,560
<i>It's a bit too late now, but we
can be there tomorrow morning.</i>

106
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,480
<i>Until then, you're on your own.</i>

107
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,920
I can probably handle five bodies.

108
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,480
Is that a black eye he has?

109
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:38,840
It looks more like a birthmark, I think.

110
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:52,240
What's happening? Should I continue
looking after her, Einar? Einar?

111
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:06,240
Someone ought to tell her
that we found her friends.

112
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:20,960
Here. Put the clothes and
jewellery in these bags, -

113
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,720
- and then remember to
mark them properly, Audhild.

114
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,000
- I should do it by myself?
- I'll be right back.

115
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,000
Missing Persons
Unsolved Cases

116
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,880
"No trace of lost boy"

117
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,920
Hello?

118
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:17,000
- Sorry. Am I disturbing you?
- No, not at all.

119
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,600
Oh, damn...!

120
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:35,120
It's not exactly the average
Norwegian Easter tourist.

121
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,400
Looks more like a Dane who
took the "Rule of 5" literally.

122
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:43,240
Yes. "Be prepared against bad
weather even on short trips."

123
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,240
You know the rules.
Do you like mountain climbing?

124
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,040
No, but an idiot tried to convince me -

125
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,080
- that number four was: "Stay
with experienced mountaineers."

126
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,720
Did you want something specific?

127
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,400
No, I'm just out to
reconnoitre ...

128
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,960
Not reconnoitre. I'm just checking
that everything's in order.

129
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:21,200
Maybe I'll see you later. Bye.

130
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,880
"Your friends are down in the morgue."
How am I supposed to say that?

131
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:46,520
It'll work out.
You're good with people.

132
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:52,320
No. Why do you say that?
I'm not even good with you.

133
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,720
Come here, Camilla.

134
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,480
- I thought you were sleeping.
- No.

135
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,040
They've come down from the mountains.
They brought your friends.

136
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,360
Would you like to see them?

137
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,640
- Would people stop doing that?
- Excuse me.

138
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:34,680
- Did you come to help?
- I brought someone with me.

139
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,280
He's ice cold.

140
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,600
You bastard! I hate you!

141
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,840
Damn. Is that blood?

142
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,080
<i>- Kim, come in.
- Sverre.</i>

143
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,320
- Where are you?
- We just entered the hotel.

144
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,680
<i>- You have to go back to the crevasse.
- Damn ...</i>

145
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:53,000
<i>I think there may be
something else there.</i>

146
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,240
Understood.

147
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,920
"Skiers disappear"
"Without a trace"

148
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,440
"Young people
lost in the mountains"

149
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,120
You ...

150
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,720
- I ...
- It's okay.

151
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,800
Thanks.

152
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,960
May I speak with you, Camilla?

153
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,680
- I'll be right back, ok?
- Yes.

154
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,000
What the hell were you doing, Camilla?
Sightseeing in the morgue?

155
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,440
- I think it helped her.
- Tell her these are vitamins.

156
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:27,520
- You want to drug her?
- She attacked a corpse, Camilla.

157
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,800
- Hermann ...
- Do as I say.

158
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,640
<i>Johan?</i>

159
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,920
Find anything?

160
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,440
<i>What is it, Johan?</i>

161
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:33,160
I have a bad fucking' feeling.

162
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,080
Yikes.

163
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,520
What happened here?

164
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,720
<i>Audhild!</i>

165
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:14,400
- Ok, come on.
- It's stuck.

166
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,560
Stuck?
What the hell do you mean?

167
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,000
Get back.

168
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,720
On the skin.
Clear, clear, clear.

169
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,040
It's happened before. Hypothermia can
prevent cellular breakdown.

170
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:37,600
There are cases where the heart rate
was down to 10-20 beats per minute.

171
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,080
- And when it comes to the wounds ...
- But he was dead.

172
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,240
Now, who's going to take care of this?

173
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,160
There.

174
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,400
- Yuk.
- The blood?

175
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:16,760
I thought that all nurses loved ...
Why did you become a nurse?

176
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,520
Because of the uniform.
Guys like nurses.

177
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:28,640
- That's why I became a policeman.
- You attract many guys in uniform?

178
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,880
No, no.

179
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:33,960
I'm just kidding.

180
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,200
You look very good in it.
Haven't you heard that before?

181
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,200
Yes, once.
It was my mother who said it.

182
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:48,480
Hey ...

183
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,480
You look pretty good
in your uniform, too.

184
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,080
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

185
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:05,600
- Bye.
- Bye.

186
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,800
- I thought you quit.
- I did.

187
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,400
She seemed very alert for someone
given 60mg of tranquilizers.

188
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,560
I understand that you're not
happy with me today, Hermann.

189
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:35,480
I'm sure you'll be a
fantastic doctor, Camilla.

190
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:36,240
Hello?

191
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,200
Sverre?

192
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:47,000
No!

193
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,640
So I didn't know ...

194
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,800
But it wasn't like that.

195
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,560
Ok ...

196
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,760
Shouldn't the emergency
lights have come on?

197
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,080
<i>He went out to play, like usual.</i>

198
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,480
<i>And then didn't come back.</i>

199
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:01,600
<i>- Has he ever done that before?
- No.</i>

200
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,880
<i>He went out to play, like usual.</i>

201
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,880
<i>And then didn't come back.</i>

202
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,640
<i>He went out to play, like usual.</i>

203
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:24,160
<i>... to play, like usual.</i>

204
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,400
"Skinned dog
found on mountain"

205
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:35,920
"Grazing sheep massacred
animal grave in the mountains"

206
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,000
"Grotesque incidents
threaten hotel operations"

207
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:48,560
"Survived the fire
in abandoned mountain hotel"

208
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,800
"He was hanging on by a hair
says medical officer Haldor Mækland."

209
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:04,840
<i>This is Haldor.</i>

210
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,520
- It must local. The streetlights are lit.
- I'll turn on the generator.

211
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,280
See to the patients.

212
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:18,880
Hello?

213
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,480
Oh, God.

214
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:52,640
What?

215
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,640
Did they...?

216
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,440
Audhild?

217
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,000
Audhild?

218
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,440
What the hell?

219
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,120
Stay away.

220
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,880
You stay away from me!

221
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,880
We'd been searching for the family
for five days without result.

222
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:26,200
Everyone was tired
and wanted to go home.

223
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:32,320
Most had already been
looking for the boy for weeks.

224
00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:37,880
So you were alone at the
hotel when the fire broke out?

225
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:41,240
Yes, as far as I know.

226
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,840
Another beer, Haldor?
We're closing now.

227
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,720
The police report concluded
that they died in an avalanche -

228
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,240
- while looking for their son.

229
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,840
That was at least the
official explanation.

230
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,360
The boy was never completely normal.

231
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:11,480
You didn't know?
He was stillborn.

232
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,560
In my 40 years as a physician, I've
never experienced anything like it.

233
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:24,960
He was officially dead for four hours.
A death certificate was written.

234
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,560
Then suddenly his heart
began to beat again.

235
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:40,120
He didn't cry once when he
woke up. He just lay there.

236
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,840
Quiet as a mouse.

237
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:16,440
- Is the power out?
- Hi, Daniel. Can you help me?

238
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:19,480
Help me out of these.

239
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:22,440
Look in the closet for
a sharp pair of scissors.

240
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:29,320
- Why did they tie you down?
- Quiet. Try to find some scissors.

241
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,160
There.

242
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:43,200
But if the doctor has done it,
maybe you should stay there.

243
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:49,520
It's not necessary any longer.
I was just a little restless when I slept.

244
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:52,440
Go and get the scissors. Come on.

245
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:57,560
There. Great.
Just cut here.

246
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:00,080
There.

247
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:09,560
Daniel, is the rest of the
hospital dark like it is here?

248
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:12,080
Yes.

249
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:17,360
Now we're going to go on a little
tour, but you must keep very quiet, ok?

250
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,320
- Hey ...
- I'm alright.

251
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,280
Come on.

252
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,680
What is it?

253
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,040
- Hey ...
- Was there someone there?

254
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:27,440
No.

255
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:33,880
Come on.

256
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,560
But ...

257
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,440
Sit there in the corner. There.

258
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,520
Listen, I have to go out into
the corridor and try to ...

259
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:26,080
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

260
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:30,440
Just wait here a bit and
I'll be back to get you.

261
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:35,560
It's almost like playing hide and
seek. Do you like to play that?

262
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:39,880
Be quiet.
Good. Bye.

263
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,960
Do you think it will snow tonight?

264
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:54,920
<i>Hey, you've reached Ole and
Camilla. Leave a message.</i>

265
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:57,960
Ole? Ole, where are you?

266
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:01,840
Things have gone to hell here.
People have been killed.

267
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
You have to get help.
You have to get help, ok?

268
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:31,040
- Jannicke.
- Stay completely still.

269
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:45,000
It's alright. Nothing came out.

270
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:47,480
It's alright.

271
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:52,520
The telephone ...

272
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,160
Hello?

273
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:26,200
- How many are here?
- Besides us, there are five.

274
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,760
- A little boy.
- Daniel?

275
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,520
An old lady, and Audhild.

276
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,560
No, there's only four.

277
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,640
- Did you count the policeman?
- Three.

278
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:48,960
- And the doctor?
- He went to turn the power on.

279
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,600
Ok. We'll get Daniel first,
and then the old lady. Ok?

280
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,280
Ok.

281
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:19,600
- Come on.
-I have to look for Hermann.

282
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,520
- Come on.
- No.

283
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:57,520
Come on!

284
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:04,640
What are you doing?

285
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:07,720
Hi.

286
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,000
Come on.

287
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,680
Come on.

288
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,320
- We've locked him in the basement.
- Who else is in there?

289
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,360
You can't do that. Kim!

290
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,760
- Now you calm down.
- You have no idea what's in there!

291
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:52,560
I know more than you think.

292
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:58,760
- There are people alive in there.
- Calm down and get in the car.

293
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,320
She just saved my life in there.

294
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:07,360
We can't give weapons to civilians.
Tell me what happened.

295
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:09,560
Does it fit properly? Good.

296
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:12,880
Ole, what are you doing?

297
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:16,200
Ole, don't go in there.

298
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:20,480
It's going to be alright, ok?
Trust me.

299
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,120
I'll be alright.

300
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:45,120
Don't contact me before you hear something,
so you don't give away our position.

301
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,640
Clear.

302
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,800
Ole, cover me.

303
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:08,240
- What do we do now?
- We pull out.

304
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,720
What about the civilians?
And Sverre?

305
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,560
I hear what you're saying, but
that door tells me something else.

306
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:18,720
We pull out and wait
for reinforcements.

307
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,360
<i>- We're coming out.
- Roger.</i>

308
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,520
- Did you get him?
- No, he wasn't in the basement.

309
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,200
<i>Roger.</i>

310
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:39,240
<i>- Repeat last message.
- Ok.</i>

311
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,280
<i>Roger.</i>

312
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:53,480
Cover the front.
Ole, cover the rear.

313
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,600
Fuck.

314
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,840
- It's Sverre.
- Kim, wait!

315
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,320
Ole, behind me!

316
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:42,280
Kim!

317
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,800
Kim!

318
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,560
Einar!

319
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,720
Ole, watch out!

320
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,280
Einar?
Einar, come in.

321
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,960
Einar, come in.
Einar, can you give me a report?

322
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:42,680
<i>Come in, Einar.</i>

323
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:47,000
<i>Einar?</i>

324
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:50,120
Einar, damn it, come in.

325
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:56,200
Let me out and we'll go in together, ok?

326
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:20,360
I was in the bathroom.

327
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,080
Ok. Ok.

328
01:10:29,239 --> 01:10:31,360
Let's go in.

329
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,720
Shit!

330
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,400
Camilla, get the gun!
On the floor!

331
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:00,080
Camilla, you have to get the gun!

332
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:01,680
Come on.

333
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:09,880
Come on!

334
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,960
No!

335
01:11:41,479 --> 01:11:43,680
Ole!

336
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,240
Hi ...

337
01:12:51,319 --> 01:12:53,680
Shit! Damn it!

338
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:58,640
Come on, then, you fucking bastard!

339
01:14:20,199 --> 01:14:22,600
Are you crazy?

340
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:25,200
You're going to die, Jannicke.

343
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,640
"Were here."

344
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,440
Fuck.

345
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,880
What?

346
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,720
Camilla.

347
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,080
Jannicke.

348
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:51,480
He's dead now.

349
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,400
I've killed him before.
