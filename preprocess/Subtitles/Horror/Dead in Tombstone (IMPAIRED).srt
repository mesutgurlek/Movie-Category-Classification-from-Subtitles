I seen the blood
drain out of him

647
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:12,403
when I put the bullet
in his heart.

648
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:16,164
I killed you once.

atone for the sins

down here, boys?

we can hit 100.

to 200, Washington,

behind on deliveries

Yeah, what I'm telling you
is he ain't no damn stranger.

01:03:19,767 --> 01:03:20,961
Who is he?

Yes,

759
01:05:08,447 --> 01:05:11,007
I think you should stay
down until all this
gets sorted out.

760
01:05:11,687 --> 01:05:14,485
Hey, limey!
I just came for Red.

761
01:05:14,567 --> 01:05:16,319
Why don't you come
and get your boy?
JUDAH: Red,

762
01:05:16,807 --> 01:05:19,924
is this the fellow that's
been putting your men
on display at the chapel?

763
01:05:20,007 --> 01:05:22,396
Yeah, but me and the boys
are taking care of it,
obviously.

764
01:05:22,487 --> 01:05:25,559
Really? Because just
the opposite appears
to be the case.

765
01:05:25,647 --> 01:05:28,115
I pay you to run this
operation and keep
our interests secure,

766
01:05:28,207 --> 01:05:30,243
which clearly they are not.
Which begs the question,

767
01:05:30,407 --> 01:05:31,999
where's my gold?

768
01:05:32,167 --> 01:05:33,520
Oh, you're gonna
get it, Judah.

769
01:05:33,607 --> 01:05:34,801
You're gonna get it.

770
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:36,320
You're the one
protecting him?

771
01:05:37,007 --> 01:05:39,646
The federal courts were going
to let the mining rights
revert to Edendale.

772
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:42,195
So if I wanted control
of the mine,

773
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:44,319
I simply needed
control of the town.

774
01:05:44,727 --> 01:05:47,605
Mr. Cavanaugh here
provides that control.

775
01:05:47,687 --> 01:05:49,598
And I...

776
01:05:50,727 --> 01:05:52,046
I pay off all
the right people.

777
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:54,481
So,

778
01:05:54,567 --> 01:05:56,956
if I don't see every
ounce of my gold,

779
01:05:57,327 --> 01:05:58,919
I'll take my men

780
01:05:59,007 --> 01:06:01,396
and leave you in the
predicament in which
I found you.

Please allow me to
take care of this
for you.

01:06:25,327 --> 01:06:26,396

Stop right there,

You ain't going no place.

977
01:22:49,287 --> 01:22:51,596
I made this town.
I put money in all
your pockets!

Is that it?

985
01:23:32,727 --> 01:23:33,716
No, Rojo,

986
01:23:34,327 --> 01:23:36,204
not a hero.
