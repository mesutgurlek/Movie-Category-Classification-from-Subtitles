Kerry, Eric is

not a homicide case.

It's always
somebody's fault.

81
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,162
That somebody isn't you.

82

That someone
is still out there.

83
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:26,842
So put all your anger into
finding them and putting them away.

All right?

85

86
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:33,355
how the hell could Jigsaw
do all of this?

87
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:36,127
He was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him.

88
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:40,402
I'm not so sure
he did.

89
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:42,774
So far this doesn't follow
any of his patterns.

00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,177

91
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,982
Well...how'd
you get in here?

92
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:49,320
We cut the door down.
[Kerry] Why?

93
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:51,658
Because somebody heard
an explosion and

94
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:53,028
called us.

95
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,965
I mean, why did you
have to cut the door down?

96
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:56,802
It was welded shut.

97

I don't follow.

100
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:04,083
If the aim of Jigsaw's game was to
get out before the bomb went off,

101
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:05,954
then why was the door
welded shut?

102
00:11:05,955 --> 00:11:08,391
The guy couldn't
get out if he wanted to.

103
00:11:08,392 --> 00:11:11,531

<i>report to trauma immediately.</i>

166
00:18:56,228 --> 00:18:57,162

168
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:04,109
[Nurse] Pressure down to 70.
He's going into shock.

169
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,247
Get an OR ready.
We gotta crack his chest.

170
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:07,950
[Nurse] Do we get a bolus?
500 wide open?

171
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:08,852
No.

172
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:12,125
What?

173
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:17,602
No air entry on the right side.
- And?

174
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:19,573
Let's get
a chest tube in him.

175
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:22,612
We gotta get him to OR now.

176
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:24,616
[Nurse] His stats are dropping.
He's gonna code.

177
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:27,055
[beeping]

178
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:27,990
I'm doin' it.

179
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,148
I'm getting a rush of air.

180
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:43,321
Stats are improving.
Pressure back to 80.

181
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:45,726
Pressure normal.

182
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:05,883
If you got something on your mind,
just don't bring it in here.

183
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:07,804
We don't have any seconds to spare, Lynn.

184
00:20:07,905 --> 00:20:10,575
The woman standing in front
of me had to be dragged

185
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,548
from the locker room to put a
chest tube in a trauma patient?

186
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:15,452
Lynn Denlon should have
been the first one there.

187
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,195
Lynn.

188
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:22,232
Lynn!

189
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:58,671
What the hell?

190
00:20:58,672 --> 00:20:59,707
I'm locked in!

191
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:01,410

192

Let's go.

207
00:23:17,216 --> 00:23:19,954
What is this place?!
What is this place?!

208
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:22,225
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

209
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,644
What is...this place?
[breathing fearfully]

[screaming]

212
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,010
Hello, Dr. Denlon.

213
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:52,887
You may not remember me, but
I most certainly remember you.

214
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:58,431
I was a guest
at your hospital once.

215
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:02,606
Where am I?

216
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:07,750
Do you remember me?

217
00:24:17,336 --> 00:24:18,571
I've seen you on television.

218
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:22,980
Lawrence Gordon
was your doctor.

219
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:26,453
I was his patient,
and he was mine.

220
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:29,827
As you can see
from that report,

221
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:31,630
my prognosis
isn't good.

222
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:35,438
Would you agree?

223
00:24:41,651 --> 00:24:44,857
There's no preventative
treatment for what you have.

224
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,963
I remember you saying
that to me once before

225
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:50,601
in almost the exact
same tone.

226
00:24:50,602 --> 00:24:54,409
Leave it to a doctor to find
such a cold, clinical way

227
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,582
of saying I'm
a dead man walking.

228
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,355
Looking at me, how long
would you say I have left?

229
00:25:00,356 --> 00:25:03,594
I'd have to examine you.

230
00:25:03,595 --> 00:25:06,533
Even then, a frontal lobe
tumor is unpredictable.

231
00:25:06,534 --> 00:25:10,074
The growth depends on the rate
of mitosis versus apoptosis--

232
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:14,616
I'm sorry, but there's all this
crude medical equipment around me

233
00:25:14,617 --> 00:25:18,190
causing you to believe that
you're still inside a hospital.

234
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:21,130
No.
- Then why are you speaking to me

235
00:25:21,131 --> 00:25:24,202
in that graduate school
medical jargon?

236
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,777
Look at me!

237
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:30,248
Aaahh! Aah! Uhh!

238
00:25:30,249 --> 00:25:32,218
Now, you look at me.

239
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:34,824
I asked you
a simple question.

240
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,660
Based on your experience,

241
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:40,301
how long do you
think I have left?

242
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:42,539
It's not a simple answer.

243
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,615
Based on your file,
I'd say...not long.

244
00:25:47,616 --> 00:25:49,954
[coughing]

245
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:58,437
Death is a surprise party.

246
00:25:58,438 --> 00:26:04,149
Unless, of course...you're
already dead on the inside.

247
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:09,059
Unless you're
the type of person

248
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,967
who swallows antidepressants
to hide the pain, huh?

249
00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:15,238
Turns their back
on their husband.

250
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:17,442
Neglects their child.

251
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:20,081
Who has every possible
advantage in life

252
00:26:20,082 --> 00:26:22,652
but chooses not to advance.

253
00:26:22,653 --> 00:26:24,556
What do you want from me?

254
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:27,897
What do I want?

255
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:31,370
I want to play a game.

256
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:37,449
The rules of the game
are simple.

257
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,356
The consequences for
breaking them are great.

258
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:43,127
Death.

259
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,537
You're being tested.
Your will is being tested.

260
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:50,575
Your will to keep
someone alive.

261
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:53,514
Can you do that?
Can you follow the rules

262
00:26:53,515 --> 00:26:55,451
and grant someone the gift of life?
- What is this?

263
00:26:55,452 --> 00:26:57,723
No! Get it--aah!

264
00:26:57,724 --> 00:27:01,764
No! No! What is this!
What are you doing

265
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:03,367
to me?

266
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:05,104
Aah! Aah!

267
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:13,220
The device that you're wearing is
linked to my heart rate monitor.

268
00:27:13,221 --> 00:27:16,160
The second that heart
rate monitor flatlines

269
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:18,097
or you move out of range,

270
00:27:18,098 --> 00:27:21,069
an explosion will
go off in that collar.

271
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,444
Your life and my life
will end simultaneously.

272
00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:28,885
Please. Please don't
do this to me.

273
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:31,791
I have a family.
I have a family.

274
00:27:31,792 --> 00:27:34,129
Let me give you
the simple version.

275
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,472
You will keep him alive,
whatever it takes.

276
00:27:39,473 --> 00:27:44,115
No excuses.
No equivocations.

277
00:27:44,116 --> 00:27:46,019
[whispers]
No crying.

278
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,692
What do you mean,
keep him alive?

279
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:56,473
Out there, on those screens,
we have another test subject.

280
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,511
A man.

281
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:04,589
He will face
a series of tests.

282
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:09,767
You have to keep John alive
until he makes it through.

283
00:28:10,803 --> 00:28:13,173
If he completes
all of his tests

284
00:28:13,174 --> 00:28:14,977
and John is still breathing,

285
00:28:14,978 --> 00:28:17,515
then I will
remove your collar...

286
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,223
...and you're
free to go.

287
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:22,392
Uhh!

288
00:28:22,393 --> 00:28:24,997
You're a vital piece
of my puzzle, Dr. Denlon.

289
00:28:24,998 --> 00:28:28,672
A critical part of what
could be my final test.

290
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:34,282
Amanda, it's time

you won't let me

I mean, you're

500
00:50:18,525 --> 00:50:21,095
Just do it quietly
so John doesn't hear me die.

501
00:50:21,096 --> 00:50:22,665
Otherwise he's likely
to get upset,

rip off his heart rate monitor.

Then you just have to find
the sensor and disarm it

detonating.

Or you could try and take
the collar off yourself.

could be tricky.

Don't you think
it would be wise

I asked you to tell me
about your husband.

862
01:28:42,497 --> 01:28:44,834
It's like
we're strangers now.

01:28:44,835 --> 01:28:47,306
And?

864
01:28:47,307 --> 01:28:52,048
The last time I saw him,
we were so disconnected.

865
01:28:52,049 --> 01:28:53,116
But now...

866
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:59,897
...I'd give...
anything in the world...

867
01:29:03,639 --> 01:29:05,074
...to see my husband.

868
01:29:06,812 --> 01:29:08,481
Matrimony's always
fascinated me.

869
01:29:08,482 --> 01:29:11,086
Husbands barely able
to look at their wives,

wives on their backs

871
01:29:12,557 --> 01:29:15,962
in motel rooms
with perfect strangers,

872
01:29:15,963 --> 01:29:17,098
people who bear children

873
01:29:17,099 --> 01:29:18,768
only to neglect them.

874
01:29:18,769 --> 01:29:21,507
Till death do us part,
indeed.

875
01:29:21,508 --> 01:29:24,847
I don't know
what you think you know,

876
01:29:24,848 --> 01:29:27,653
but my marriage has
survived more suffering

877
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:30,224
than someone like you
could ever grasp.

878
01:29:30,225 --> 01:29:31,159
Suffering?

879
01:29:32,864 --> 01:29:34,466
You haven't seen
anything yet.

880
01:29:37,607 --> 01:29:39,376
Someone like me?
Who am I?

881
01:29:39,377 --> 01:29:41,814
A monster.

882
01:29:41,815 --> 01:29:42,849
A murderer.

883
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:44,486
I don't condone murder,

884
01:29:44,487 --> 01:29:48,193

despise murderers.

We don't need you.

like human beings?

Yeah, but he's not
all the way out yet.

Undo her collar, Amanda,

No, he's not finished.

He's not all the way.

Amanda, Lynn is more
important than you know.

916
01:31:53,278 --> 01:31:57,386
Unlock her collar
and let her go.

917
01:31:57,387 --> 01:31:59,590
I said no.

918

Amanda, there are rules.

919
01:32:08,776 --> 01:32:10,779
She doesn't deserve
to go free.

on the grounds
of some game?

985
01:37:53,198 --> 01:37:55,535
You are walking us
toward a precipice, Amanda.

986
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:57,137
Step back.

987
01:37:57,138 --> 01:37:58,541

I'll tell you,
she hasn't changed,

And I'm just a pawn

I beg you

This is your

01:47:48,554 --> 01:47:53,430
<i>I made this tape as an insurance
policy, if you will.</i>

1144
01:47:53,431 --> 01:47:55,901
Jeff!

1145
01:47:55,902 --> 01:47:58,039
<i>And if you're</i>
<i>listening to it,</i>

1146
01:47:58,040 --> 01:47:59,809
<i>then it's time to collect.</i>

1147
01:48:01,714 --> 01:48:05,721
<i>I was your final test</i>
<i>of forgiveness.</i>

1148
01:48:05,722 --> 01:48:07,491
<i>And if you are</i>
<i>listening to this,</i>

1149
01:48:07,492 --> 01:48:09,362
<i>then you failed.</i>

1150
01:48:10,832 --> 01:48:14,138
<i>Now you must pay</i>
<i>the price...</i>

1151
01:48:14,139 --> 01:48:16,810
the price for living
<i>for nothing but vengeance.</i>

1152
01:48:16,811 --> 01:48:21,085
<i>Now I will give you</i>
<i>something to live for.</i>

1153
01:48:21,086 --> 01:48:23,924
<i>I told you that</i>
<i>you couldn't kill me, Jeff,</i>

1154
01:48:23,925 --> 01:48:26,329
<i>but I didn't tell you why,</i>

1155
01:48:26,330 --> 01:48:28,133
<i>and the answer is simple.</i>

1156
01:48:28,134 --> 01:48:32,040
<i>I am the person responsible
for the loss of your child.</i>

1157
01:48:32,041 --> 01:48:39,087
I am the only person who
knows where your daughter is.

1158
01:48:39,088 --> 01:48:42,561
<i>She only has a limited</i>
<i>supply of air, Jeff,</i>

1159
01:48:42,562 --> 01:48:43,597
<i>and if you want</i>
<i>to get her back,</i>

1160
01:48:43,598 --> 01:48:45,534
<i>you'll have to play a game.</i>

1161
01:48:51,647 --> 01:48:53,082
Jeff!

1162
