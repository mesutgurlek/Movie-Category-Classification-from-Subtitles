and astrologer, amongst other things.

Right.

203
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,530
I was charged with the compilation
of sundry details

204
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,409

all of great rank and fortune.

207
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,727
I was often given leave of his library,
which holds many a closely guarded tome,

00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,450
to educate myself.

209
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,769

forced me to leave school early

but the master saw something of a...

- Sounds badly paid.
- Ah, well, well.

221
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,928
My master says that knowledge
is its own payment.

222
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,688
Yeah, well, the only knowledge I have is
that God controls my fate as he sees fit,

223
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,525
and I try to draw consolation from that,

of my many faults he's punishing me for now.

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,164
beseeching thee to continue
thy loving kindness unto us,

325
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,841
that our land may yield us her fruits
of increase, divine glory and our comfort.

326
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,002
- Through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
- Amen.

327
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,048
Long walk, that, Gloucester.

328
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,961
Better done on a full stomach.

329
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,926
(SIGHS)

330
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,050
- Sell a lot of them, do you?
- CUTLER: What?

331
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,647
Buttons.

332
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,685
Yeah, loads.

333
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,569
- COOPER: This rabbit?
- No.

334
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,410
Which end of this mysterious
beast do I have, then?

335
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,642
- The arse end.
- (CHUCKLING)

336
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,001
There is nothing like a gnawing hunger
to slow a man's pace.

337
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,605
Or fix a man's resolve.

338
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,203
Eat it, man. You don't have to marry it.

339
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,246
I cannot.

340
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,761
I'm set upon a particular fast.

341
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,970
Give it here, then, Mary.

342
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,291
- Bit sour, but passable.
- (LOW RUMBLING)

343
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,561
No more marching. No more orders.

344
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,968
(SIGHS) Any women at this alehouse?

345
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,247
(CHUCKLES)

346
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,326
What?

347
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,969
A pair of English tits
not good enough for you'?

348
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,448
'Tis indeed a blessed relief
to have been forgotten.

349
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,442
CUTLER: If l may ask a favour of you boys...

350
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,571
I will not stand by like some gentleman
while you pull more than your fair share.

351
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,201
Sounds more like an order.

352
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,884
CUTLER: I will take my weight
right along with you.

353
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,681
- What's at the end?
- Hang on, hang on.

354
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,923
Ah, rowan wood.

355
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,365
More important, what of the alehouse?

356
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,441
After.

357
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,801
You know, that's a fine stake you've got there.
I'll give you that.

358
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,684
I don't pull well on an empty pocket.

359
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,691
Every man has his price.

360
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,088
(HUFFS) My price ain't buttons.

361
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,245
Take your pick.

362
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,001
(SIGHS) Well, I'll be jiggered.

363
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,444
(RUMBLING)

364
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,401
Oh.

365
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,601
Mmm. Hmm.

366
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,240
Ah.

367
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,321
You won't eat?

368
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,044
I do not suffer the same hunger
<i>as</i> our friends.

369
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,327
I believe they would sell any religion
for a jug of beer.

370
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,851
You have an angel about you.
You've been touched for the king's evil.

371
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,925
What was it like to look upon His Majesty?

372
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,207
Curiosity fuels you, then, not food.

373
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,081
Let the King worry on his own magic.

374
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,329
God knows he needs it.

375
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,922
I, however, need yours.

376
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,120
- (GROANS)
- Pull, coward.

377
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,049
- Pull!
- I am!

378
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,607
(GRUNTING)

379
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,241
(GRUNTS) You fuck!

380
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,089
Take the strain. Dig your heel in!
Dig your heel in!

381
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,525
COOPER; All right!

382
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,365
Come on! Come on!

383
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,205
(GRUNTING)

384
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,323
One, two, three.

385
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,130
Heave!

386
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,085
One, two, three.

387
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,525
Heave!

388
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,321
- Pull!
- (GRUNTING)

389
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,920
- He's coming!
- Is that all?

390
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,570
A fucking man?

391
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,921
A cripple perhaps?

392
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,888
Maybe he's uncommonly fat.

393
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,725
I once had to pull
my father-in-law from a bog.

394
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,205
You're in possession of a wife?
I can't believe that possible.

395
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,369
Perhaps, still, there was a misunderstanding
before I left, concerning a small fire.

396
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,007
He's coming!

397
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,368
Get up, you lazy bastard!

398
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,762
Pull, damn you!

399
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,049
What beautiful colours.

400
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,409
(CREAKING)

401
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,806
(INAUDIBLE)

402
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,042
(CREAKING CONTINUES)

403
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,287
(CHIMING)

404
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,604
No more pulling!

405
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,047
(PANTING)

406
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,408
I have brought assistance.

407
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,286
- (THUMPING)
- Oh! Sir! Sir! No, sir!

408
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,762
(THUDDING)

409
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,526
We should intervene.

410
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,611
That is he.

411
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,081
Who?

412
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,371
O'Neil.

413
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,811
The man I was charged with locating.

414
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,929
Then I am vindicated.

415
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,248
(GRUNTING)

416
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,526
Right.

417
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,681
(SQUEALING)

418
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,808
Get up, you bastard!

419
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,844
- (GRUNTING)
- Easy now. Easy now.

420
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,203
Hold him tight, boys. Beg pardon.

421
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,886
- (MARCHING DRUMBEAT)
- (GRUNTS)

422
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,645
(GROANING)

423
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,282
You men will assist me in his detainment.

424
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,561
Mmm.

425
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,525
Like gossamer.

426
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,921
What is it with you and hands?

427
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,768
News is, Cromwell's men marched north
to meet the Engagers.

428
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,562
I heard he exacted terrible revenge
on the Welsh bastards at Pembroke, sir.

429
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,643
Indeed.

430
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,605
This Irish bastard requires his mirror.

431
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,161
CUTLER; (WHISPERS) Sorry, sir.

432
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,966
Here?

433
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,089
What's that he holds?

434
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,890
A scrying mirror.

435
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,283
- A what? His what?
- WHITEHEAD: An occult tool.

436
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,325
A means for telling the past,
present, perhaps even the future.

437
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,244
He must have utilised
some diabolical method

438
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,209
to conceal his presence in the field.

439
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,601
That is why he was not visible.

440
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,851
You think he sees what an arsehole he looks,

441
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,526
standing there like the King himself?

442
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,681
No.

443
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,082
Wasn't sure which one he was at first.
Cowardly type, though.

444
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,970
You should not have any trouble from him.

445
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,600
He was the one
that would not eat mushrooms.

446
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,641
I know which one he is, Cutler.

447
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,961
Come on.

448
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,724
- Ugh.
- Stand up!

449
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,882
What are you doing? Get up.

450
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,123
(SIGHS) I don't feel 'em.

451
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,762
- What?
- My balls.

452
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,042
They've ceased screaming.

453
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,968
That is good, is it not?
Ii means the nettle's sting has run its course.

454
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,930
Maybe I mislaid 'em
when I was pulling the rope.

455
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,569
(CHORTLING)

456
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,211
Whitehead.

457
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,640
O'Neil.

458
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,170
I have my quarry, sir.

459
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,449
You were expected, sir.

460
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,567
Indeed?

461
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,406
A lot of time has passed since we
shared company. Things have changed.

462
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,046
WHITEHEAD: In the absence
of better-qualified men, sir,

463
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,407
I hereby place you under arrest

464
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,930
for the theft of certain documents
from the private collection of my master.

465
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,243
What the fuck is this?

466
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,525
It's a shovel.

467
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,764
In the presence of Merciful God,
I trust you will now surrender yourself

468
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,208
and return willingly
to Norwich to face your accuser.

469
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,046
How is our master?

470
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,405
Well, I pray.

471
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,844
I believe he still has you doing a lot of that.

472
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,524
Praying, I mean.

473
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,288
The master is of advanced years,
as you know.

474
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,843
Your outrageous pillage
has greatly aggravated his dropsy.

475
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,245
CUTLER: Move.

476
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,968
COOPER: What kind of merry band is this?

477
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,600
O'NEIL: I'm sure
he would have come himself.

478
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,283
But instead he sends you.

479
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,569
The faithful servant.

480
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,170
O'NEIL: Come, walk.

481
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,083
You need no invitation.

482
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,607
This is your country, is it not?

483
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,290
Although I've claimed a small corner
which I'm intent on raping a little.

484
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,002
'Tis only fair that I take something
in return for my countrymen's troubles.

485
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,806
Cutler has you marked as a coward.

494
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,844
It would seem the master
has kept you a veritable virgin

00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,281
as to the workings of the world.

Only in my spare time, which is limited,

502
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,086
because of my increased duties
in your absence,

503
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,451
but, um, of the highestquality, I'm told.

504

to the world but to yourself, it seems.

Unfortunately, my constitution was not
suited to the master's pious regiment.

508

509

510
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,443

when the opportunity arises.

513
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,087
I have had little success
in applying the master's arts

514
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,647
in looking for anything of great worth.

515
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,801
Which is why I have conjured you.

516

517
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,529
I am certain of it.

518
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,962
I merely require a keener eye
to pinpoint the particular location.

520

I acknowledge that your gifts
are stronger in certain areas.

521
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,807
But you are now my divining rod.

522
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,203
I have little of my master's art in divination.

523
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,603
