1
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:19,620
You can't just say you don't know.
That's what you said on the phone.

2
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,872
When will you know?

3
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,625
I...don't know.

4
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,920
Do you want me to spend the night
somewhere else?

5
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,380
In a hotel or something?

6
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:34,718
Do you want us to meet later on?
We can talk more calmly. Do you...

7
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,804
Do you need more time?

8
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,681
What...? What do you need?

9
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,350
What has happened?

10
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,645
Bob knows that you are coming back today.

11
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,439
Well, I can...

12
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,818
I can pick him up after school
and take him...

13
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,821
to the zoo or something.

(BOB IMITATES SIREN)

15
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,965
Come and admire him.

16
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,760
BOB: Nee-na, nee-na, nee-na.

17
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,179
Nee-na, nee-na.

18
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,565
ANNA: Maybe all couples go through this.

19
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,983
Yeah.

20
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,361
One mustn't be afraid.

21
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,654
No.

22
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,865
One must speak honestly.

23
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,575
Is that difficult?

24
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,786
Is it difficult?

25
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:50,419
I haven't been much help but
I've finished that job now - it's over.

26
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,839
Maybe I was asking for too much.

27
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,009
I was the one who had the right to ask.

28
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,427
I know.

29
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,970
No, you don't.

30
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,932
Who was I doing it for, after all?

31
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,022
Were you unfaithful to me?

32
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,443
The truth is not really.

33
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,361
Were you?

34
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,446
No.

35
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,656
There's always someone else
when these things happen.

36
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,617
Not in this case.

37
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,120
All right, well...

38
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,581
What's happening to us is just...

39
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,292
It's just natural. Feelings...

40
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,377
change.

41
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,924
But without you I wouldn't feel
anything at all.

42
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,930
What do you feel now?

43
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,476
Are you really interested?

44
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,189
No.

45
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,694
There you are, you see.
It's the same with me.

46
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,529
I don't even want you now.

47
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,324
- What time did you meet him?
- 8.30.

48
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,243
- Where?
- In the park.

49
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,787
- Was he willing?
- Yes, verbally.

50
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,498
Did you sense or detect weariness in him?

51
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,793
No. A correct appraisal of the realities.

52
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,921
- Is it making him bitter?
- No. Greedy.

53
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,839
But you felt his power?

54
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,883
You mean did I feel fear?

55
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,971
No because that would have prevented me
answering all your questions.

56
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,723
- How many vials did he take with him?
- Two.

57
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,102
What procedure have you devised for
contacting him again?

58
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,561
It's all in my report.

59
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:35,440
I suggest it's more economical
to fill in my successor.

60
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,318
We don't feel there is a need
for a successor.

61
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,028
I've completed my job.

62
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,240
Brilliantly. That's why
we want to rehire you.

63
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,783
It's out of the question.

64
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,119
And what would be the reason
for your refusal?

65
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,245
Family.

66
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,831
- Couldn't we be of some help there?
- No.

67
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,750
Wouldn't it be advisable for you
to reconsider?

68
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,210
I'm unable to do that.

69
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,212
Would you be unable for a long time?

70
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,255
I hope not.

71
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,883
Aren't you allowing feelings to prevent
you from answering your own questions?

72
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,137
Exactly why I advise you
to hire my successor.

73
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,179
Good.

74
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,849
Any questions?

75
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,350
No.

I am downtown.

82

Why downtown? I've been waiting all day.

83
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,158
I need some time to think.

84
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,453
What do you mean "to think"?
Think about what?

85
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,788
To think about me.

86
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,998
Wh... Wh... Where are you?

87
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,167

- Margie, this is Mark.

90
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:21,458
Now, I know there's no sympathy
between us and it's...

91
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,962
hard for me to ask you for help but...

92
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,716
you're her only friend.
Now, just tell me the truth.

93
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,593
She has somebody?

94
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,472
She wished you'd say or do something.
Something to reinstall you.

95
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,516
You know, a magic wave of the wand.

96
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,809
You arrived sooner than expected, Mark.

97
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,355
Yes, sure, this is all my fault.
Now, how long has this been going on?

98
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,606
Quite long.

99
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,024
Who is he?

100
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,318
Oh, Mark! I don't...

101
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,071
Your wife keeps her own secrets.

102

Margie...

103
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:59,371
I don't have a magic wand.
I don't intend to hang on.

104
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:04,084
But make her talk to me.
It'll be the way that she wants.

Yes.

- Do you like it?
- Yes.

As you want.

126

Half an hour at the Cafe Einstein.

127

I'm too far for half an hour.

Yes.

Is he listening?

No.

132
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,508
But he is there.

133
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,801
Yes.

134
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,325
Would 800 a month for Bob be enough?

135
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,451
I suppose.

136
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,079
Will you move in with him or
keep the apartment?

137
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,206
I'll keep it if you allow me to.

- At all?
- At all.

140

How can you say that?

141
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,260
He's going to be fucked up
enough as it is.

142
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,514
I don't want to fuck him up even more
by playing Sunday Daddy.

143
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,558
- What were you to him anyway?
- Precisely.

But...

145
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,021
He knows you. He's yours. He needs...

A real father full time?

147
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:36,528
Well, I thought I could be, coming home
from the war, so to speak.

148
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,615
You say it's better with him than with me.

149

I get bored of it.

00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,622
Tell me.

151
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:51,251
I think what you want to do to Bob is...

152
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,838
Inhuman? So what you're doing
must be human.

- How long is it going to last?
- I don't know.

One week? Two weeks?

155
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:04,472
And how do you dispose of ideas
like honesty and loyalty?

156
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:11,020
If I could only believe that it happened
cleanly at first sight.

157
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,481
OK, if it makes things easier,

I met him, if you have to know.

No-one is good or bad

but if you want, I am the bad one

and if I knew he existed in this world,
I would have never had Bob with you.

- Hallo?

00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,223
Mm...

170
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,267
Hallo? Hallo?

How... How long have I...?

175
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,071
How long have I been here?

176
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,574
Three weeks, sir.

177
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,176
What happened? It's Daddy.

178
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,638
Mummy said she would be right back
but she never came.

179
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,849
Then Margie called and told me to be brave

180
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:39,562
because she had broke her leg and
she had to have the cast put on.

181
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,361
You've been alone for a long time?

182
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,908
Look, I got a new boat.

183
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,749
Did you get it from Mummy?

184
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,835
No. From Uncle Heinrich.

185
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,214
Long ago?

186
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,716
Yes.

187
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,176
Yesterday?

188
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,513
No. Before you were coming back
from far away.

189
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,851
OK, little piggy.

190
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,437
Come on, let's get out of this mess.

191
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,773
How did you make such a mess?

(KEY IN LOCK)

193
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,356
This is not always like this, Mark.
Usually I'm on time.

194
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,733
I'm not interested.

195
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,944
I came to tell you that
I can't live without you

196
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,321
and I'm ready to understand
whatever there is

197
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,657
but it doesn't look like
it makes much sense.

198
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,785
- You can't take Bob away from me.
- I'm not trying.

199
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:22,874
You can continue to visit whenever
you want, but I'm taking over here.

200
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,005
Anna, is there anything I can do?

201
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,425
- You could just...
- Yes?

202
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,719
- I must...
- Yes?

203
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,970
I must...

204
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,223
You must restore order.
You must leave him.

205
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,809
You will call him.
You will say it is over.

206
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,520
Now, I don't care if you tell him
you love him

207
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,440
but he's not your family -
your family is here.

208
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,650
You must call him now.

209
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,403
- But I can't on the phone.
- I don't trust you.

210
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,782
- I have to tell him face to face.
- I don't trust you.

211
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,326
On the phone.

212
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,870
Oh Jesus!

213
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:07,460
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

Jesus!

215
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:12,632
If you want to stay, make that call.

216
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:31,943
It's still quite warm. I don't think
you'll need a winter coat or sweater.

217
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,872
I can't stand to see you like this.

218
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:50,294
It could be the way you want.
Just don't cry any more.

He said she won't be coming back.

Anna's not here.
I haven't seen her for weeks.

him to school from now on.

- What?

I'm so sorry. It's impossible.

Have you ever seen my wife?

254

Naturally. Every day of the school year.

You want me to break down
the bloody door?

You don't have to. It's open.

261

We don't have to be brutal to each other
or even impolite.

262
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:16,519
Our situation is like a mountain lake

I am not astonished you are here.

I was thinking about you
just before you came

266
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:28,072
so now that you're here,
let's be open to each other.

267

You can hate me as much as you like.

268
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,372
But it's you who wants
to know things from me.

269
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,833
So please make it possible.

270
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,920
I am suffering as much as you are.

271
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:46,924
The fact that Anna did not inform you
was harmful to everyone

272
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,051
but I always accept Anna's ways,

273
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,805
as I think no-one has a right
to impose his will on anyone.

274
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,559
So that's how you've changed her so much.

275
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,020
Possibly, but is it changing her
or making her open to herself?

276
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:03,607
So open she's inarticulate at night
and you have to speak for her?

277
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,025
What are you talking about?

278
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,736
We spoke on the phone last night,
you and I, didn't we?

279
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,073
Stop it. I just arrived from Hamburg.
You weren't listening to me.

280
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,368
I was just trying to make her comprehend
that I love her.

281
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,830
I left the day you arrived to give her
the chance to decide for herself.

282
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,248
I allowed you your chance.

283
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,583
Bullshit!

284
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,461
I'm not obliged to listen to you speak
in that way. It's offensive.

285
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,671
How long have you been fucking me over?

286
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,089
A year.

287
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,970
All my visits home, all that time.

288
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,096
Yes.

289
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,308
And this is what you mean by
accepting Anna's ways?

290
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,809
Precisely.

291
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,858
The key being the infinitive.

292
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,860
To accept.

293
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,244
I have been honest with you.

294
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,581
Would you permit me to enquire
on a specific point?

295
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:06,003
On your last visit home,
were you content with your wife?

296
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,838
I mean sexually.

297
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,340
Why?

298
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:14,261
Because in that period we reached
a state of perfect harmony.

299
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,263
Er...

300

My mother.

301
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,152
- Is she here all the time?
- Yes.

302
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,030
- Even when you're fucking Anna?
- Of course.

303
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,205
Agh!

304
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:08,232
Why?

305
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,326
Agh!

Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full.

314

One for...the master, one for the dame

315
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:04,371
and one for the little boy
that lives down the lane.

316
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,875
- Can I go out into the back yard?
- Yes, you may.

But you take your sandwich with you.

318

Where were you?

319
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,511
I wrote you. I was at Margie's.

320
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,597
That's not true. I spoke to her.

321
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,723
I was with him.

322
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:26,185
That's not true either. I saw him.
I may...stink from him.

323
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,645
- But he's not lying.
- I was...

324
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,438
- I was with friends.
- Who?

325
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,106
- New friends.
- I'll check.

326
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,734
Yes, check, check, check, check, check!

00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:55,126
I just... I just saw you come in.

491
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:57,628
It'll only take a moment.

492
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,088
But I don't want you to be here.

493
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,049
I quite understand, miss,
but it's me or the police.

494
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,594
A lady got hurt on the sidewalk,
a Turkish woman.

495
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:08,973
You might say she shouldn't be here in the
first place but she lodged a complaint.

496
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,601
So what can I do about it?

497
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,771
Nothing.

498
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,524
Please.

499
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:48,971
Is it OK?

500
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,723
Moment.

501
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,699
So?

502
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,493
Excuse me, the bathroom?

503
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:13,496
The bathroom doesn't have a window.

504
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,831
Are you sure?

505
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,124
Absolutely.

506
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,710
Some bathrooms have windows
this side of the house.

507
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,379
Not in this one.

508
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,590
I'm afraid I still have to check it
before someone else gets...

509
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,551
Would you care for a glass of wine?

510
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,010
- Wine?
- Yes.

511
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,929
I'm afraid I...

512
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,266
Yes, wine!

513
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:37,520
- I'm afraid you...
- Oh, come on. Don't be so formal.

514
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:41,232
Miss, it doesn't make any sense.
I've got k-k-kids.

515
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,485
I only came for the windows.

516
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,281
I'm sorry, miss, but...

517
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,283
I still have to have a look.

518
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,209
Oh! It broke!

519
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,545
(SQUELCHING AND DRIPPING)

00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,759

00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,907

(SHE SCREAMS AGAIN)

523
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,055
How long?

524
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,265
Ah... Ages and ages.

525
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,643
- Much longer than I could.
- (DOOR BUZZER)

526
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,274
BOB: Nee-na, nee-na, nee-na.

527
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:09,570
Hello, I'm sorry to bother you so late.
May I see your wife?

528
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,948
No. She went out.

529
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,116
BOB: Nee-na, nee-na, nee-na.

530
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,494
That's not entirely true. She...

531
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,829
She doesn't live with us any longer.

532
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:19,956
Oh.

533
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,332
It's about Bob.

534
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,250
Ah! Bob!

535
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,002
Bob is fine.

536
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,132
He's just beaten the world record
in tub diving.

537
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:36,180
Oh! (SHE LAUGHS)

538
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,558
- Hello, Bob.
- Come on. Cut it out, Bob.

00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,896
Look, um...

542
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,856
- Would you be so kind?
- (BUZZER CONTINUES)

543
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,776
He's actually been in the bath
for about an hour.

544
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,403
Yes, of course.

545
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,660
I've called many times.

546
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:02,957
I wanted to discuss with you
the redistribution of our parts

547
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,628
in this fundamentally vulgar structure,
the triangle.

548
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,089
In other words, where is she?

549
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:13,718
I've been giving a great deal of thought
to the illogical aspects

550
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,511
of your anger and your defence.

551
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,013
Is Anna with you?

552
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,723
And if?

553
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,976
I would only ask to have a talk with her.

554
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,311
What if I said no?

555
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,148
I'm sorry I used violence with you.

556
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:32,111
Now I'd only apply my psychic process
to make her come to me.

557
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,488
Oh, I'm so sorry, she's not here.

558
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,491
Did I tell you I had a wife
and a daughter?

559
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,784
No!

560
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,536
They live in Cincinnati.

561
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,996
What does that do for you?

562
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,498
They will always remain my first family.

563
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,377
Anna could be the second
and you and Bob in some sense.

564
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,296
Do you have a dog?

565
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:51,964
Would that I had.

566
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,758
You misuse me.

567
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,137
It's stiff and blocked men like you that
lead us to the concentration camp.

568
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:02,808
Who are the crusaders of every
blind principle, so-called ideology

569
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,436
humanity invents to strangle me?

570
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,188
Why don't you like me?

571
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,107
Why don't you draw in
the plentitude of my love

572
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,319
and pull it all over your life
like a veil?

573
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,488
OK, I like you.

574
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:19,575
And I can tell you where Anna lives.

575
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,454
Lives?

576
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:27,249
Only...I don't know the guy's name.

577
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:30,044
It's impossible. It doesn't make sense.

578
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,462
Why not?

579
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,632
Because you think you've given her
the supreme pleasure?

580
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:39,845
You with your yin-yang balls
dangling from your zen brain.

581
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:44,558
OK, maybe it does boil down to
a sexual contest, in which case...

582
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,478
I'm sure you win hands down.

583
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,482
- But is that all?
- BOB: Nee-na, nee-na.

584
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,818
Nee-na, nee-na, nee-na.

585
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,861
(BOB CONTINUES)

586
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,447
I used to be afraid of you.

587
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,492
But I don't think I am any more.

588
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:05,037
There's nothing to fear except God.

589
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,541
Whatever that means to you.

590
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,088
For me God is a disease.

591
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:30,229
That's why through the disease
we can reach God.

592
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:33,649
"Tracking something," said Winnie-the-Pooh
very mysteriously.

593
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,068
"Tracking what?" said Piglet,
coming closer.

594
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:40,114
"That's just what I ask myself.
I ask myself, What?"

595
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,907
"What do you think you'll answer?"

596
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,034
He wants to say good night to you.

597
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,121
Thank you.

598
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,711
You smell clean.

599
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:55,921
Do you like Helen?

600
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:59,592
I think so.

601
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,552
Are you not sure?

602
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,554
Well, I don't know her yet.

603
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,264
Do you like her?

604
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,391
Yes, and who don't you like?

605
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,728
Well, I don't like Heinrich

606
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,856
and I don't like that sailboat.

607
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,399
Why? He's funny.

608
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,027
I don't like...

609
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,947
I don't like Mummy to like him
more than us.

610
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:26,076
Who's prettier? Mummy or Helen?

611
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,287
Who do you think is prettier?

612
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,788
You tell me.

613
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,707
Our Mummy.

614
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,715
Good night, son.

615
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,225
Thank you.

616
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,687
Do you have anyone to help you with him?

617
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,566
Oh it's... It's not a problem. I...

618
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,235
I have plenty of time.

619
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:03,197
Bob won't say anything to me.
He keeps his words for himself.

620
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,035
He knows everything, senses everything.
Children are amazing.

621
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,620
Yeah.

622
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,249
After lunch we have an hour's rest.

623
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,378
Bob very often goes to sleep.

624
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,798
When he does he cries or shouts.

625
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,466
Does he do it at home?

626
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,968
No.

627
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,220
Oh.

628
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,472
He screams.

629
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,475
It is very difficult to calm him down.

630
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,853
When he wakes up he pretends
that nothing happened.

631
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,855
What can I say?

632
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,861
I'm at war against women.

633
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,447
They...have no foresight.

634
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,493
There's nothing about them that is stable,
there's nothing to trust.

635
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,871
They're dangerous.

636
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:57,001
There is nothing in common among women
except menstruation.

637
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,669
Excuse me.

638
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:03,507
I come from a place where evil seems
easier to pinpoint

639
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,260
because you can see it in the flesh.

640
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:11,348
It becomes people so you know exactly
the danger of being deformed by it.

641
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,935
Which doesn't mean I admire your world.

642
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:19,732
But I find pathetic these stories of women
contaminating the universe.

643
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,776
I'm...

644
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,571
I'm one of the contaminated.

645
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,990
Because you never feel free, do you?

646
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:31,201
So sad that for you freedom
seems to mean evil.

647
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,747
And what about lack of freedom?

648
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,542
It's extraordinary.

649
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,762
All right.

650
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:54,308
Together we can listen if Bob cries out.

651
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,919
You don't have to make love to me.

652

It wasn't very wise of me.

CHILDREN: I'm the big boss here.

667
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,196
You're the little boss.

668
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:50,757
Good morning. I phoned you at home
then I thought I might catch you here.

669
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,553
I didn't tell you where
Bob goes to school.

670
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,598
It wasn't difficult.
We have a minor problem here.

671
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,682
Yes?

672
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:02,311
The detective who was in charge of tracing
your wife didn't come home last night.

673
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,395
So?

674
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,398
He wasn't at home this morning and
he hasn't reported to the office.

675
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,858
Before we start to get worried...

676
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,069
When was he going to check it?
Yesterday or today?

677
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,154
I don't know.

678
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,739
Please don't misunderstand me.

679
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:17,117
That detective could've gotten drunk
and spent the night with whores,

680
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,454
although that's not much likely.
He could have died of a heart attack

681
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,665
If our detective doesn't show up
by noon I'll have to notify the police.

682
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:26,543
The police will start digging into your
problem. That's how it is.

683
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,295
You and I can claim professional secrecy

684
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,756
but you have to give me the address
the detective gave you.

685
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,550
Sebastianstrasse 87, floor 1 .

686
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,969
Have you been to that address yourself
or telephoned?

687
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,513
- No.
- Very sensible of you.

688
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,348
But may I ask why not?

689
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,518
I had the impression that you were
tremendously interested

690
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,727
in finding your wife.

691
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:46,480
Yes, I was.

692
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,982
I suppose I still am.

693
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:53,028
But that was out of pure, blind ambition.

694
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,948
And you know something?

695
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,953
I don't feel like there's anything
much ambitious left in me.

696
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:05,916
I see.

697
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:12,631
So I don't even have to ask you
as a personal favour

698
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:15,842
not to come to the office
until I contact you.

699
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,387
Why?

700
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:23,725
Precisely because of the...
delicacy of your feelings,

701
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:26,603
you might be able to understand that...

702
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:30,607
my interest in the case comes
from the fact that I...

703
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,734
live with that detective.

704
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,073

Do I have to answer you?

Well, you have to answer
to someone eventually.

do you call me and not the police?

I called you because we have to do
something to help her.

Why?

994
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:56,676
It isn't normal. It wasn't even human.
It was...

Divine?

996

Are you worried that he's not there

1059
01:42:45,576 --> 01:42:47,410
They should come here.

1060
01:42:47,452 --> 01:42:50,955
I've put clean sheets on the bed

- I went there.
- Where?

1064
01:42:57,921 --> 01:43:00,214
I was worried, you understand.

1065
01:43:00,257 --> 01:43:03,634
There isn't any apartment there
under the address you gave me.

1066
01:43:03,677 --> 01:43:07,847
There's only a smoking hole that the
police won't allow anybody to come near.

And Heinrich was there.

1071
01:43:19,109 --> 01:43:21,736

1072
01:43:21,778 --> 01:43:23,237

1074
01:43:25,490 --> 01:43:28,951
Did you identify him for the police?

1075
01:43:28,994 --> 01:43:33,873
No, it was only Heinrich's body.
But his soul was not there.

1076
01:43:37,169 --> 01:43:40,171
Perhaps he and his soul had
parted company before.

any idea what I'm talking about.

1079
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:49,931
He must have seemed to you better
and more beautiful than you.

1080
01:43:49,973 --> 01:43:53,643
When Anna met him, she immediately
worshipped his soul.

1081
01:43:53,685 --> 01:43:55,978
And you sent him there.

know where Heinrich's soul is.

lives separately from the body.

I had to like both of them...

...since they loved him.

01:52:17,063 --> 01:52:19,356
And he died in a flood of shit.

When I was a boy...

I had a dog and his name was Louis.

1159
01:52:27,657 --> 01:52:32,661
When he crawled under the porch to die,
I stayed there with him.

1160
01:52:32,704 --> 01:52:33,871
So what?

1161
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:42,254
I wanted to see what it was
that made him crawl under there.

1162

Nobody's a boy any more.
