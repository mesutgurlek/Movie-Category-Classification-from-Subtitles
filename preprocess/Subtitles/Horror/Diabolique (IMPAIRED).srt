will you please
tell the table proctors

154
00:12:27,026 --> 00:12:29,426
that no student will be allowed
to leave this room

155
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:31,463
until every plate is clean.

156

A child bride, gentlemen.

That`s what I married,
a child bride.

she grows younger and younger.

Don`t you wish
you had that on tape?

that makes me feel?

You should think
about me sometimes.

now that you are

Well, it must be
the post office, then.

Half the people
that work down there

I`ll send you
another check tomorrow.

I`ll drop by for it.
Tomorrow night, say?

You can bring your house guest,

From behind,
you can really see it.

I`ve been to see a lawyer,

would be very simple.

I could even keep the school.

O.K.

506
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:43,152
Go get the lights.

507

Go.

What do we do now?

525
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:06,168
Wait for the body to surface.

526
00:42:06,237 --> 00:42:08,762
They`ll do an autopsy, maybe.

527
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,434
He was drunk. He fell in.

528

When will it come up?

529
00:42:14,779 --> 00:42:16,610

Oh, come on.
You can`t pull that off.

Why hasn`t he risen yet?

532
00:42:53,718 --> 00:42:55,481
It`ll happen.

533
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:56,815
Be patient.

534
00:42:56,888 --> 00:42:59,755
I`m not going to
be able to do this.

535

Well, I suggest you try.

536

It isn`t like you
burnt the toast, Mia.

537
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:05,761
You killed your husband.

538
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:09,266
It`s a little off the chart
demerit-wise, understand?

539
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:16,439
You`re so calm.

540

Look at you.

This is a day
like any other day.

544

00:43:29,921 --> 00:43:31,354
It was self-defense.

You`ve been taking it
for too long now.

Ms. Horner. While
the cat`s away, the mice will--

00:44:40,057 --> 00:44:40,989
Apparently.

565
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:42,355
Not at all.

566
00:44:42,426 --> 00:44:45,862
Guy and I talked to
a new supplier Friday.

567

to take his classes tomorrow?

00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:04,580
Why are you torturing her?

576
00:45:04,648 --> 00:45:06,673
Isn`t it obvious
she doesn`t know where he is?

577
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:10,243
Miss Horner, please.
The students.

578
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:11,583
I don`t blame you, though.

579
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:14,590
He could make an effort
for your sakes...

580
00:45:14,658 --> 00:45:16,091
uh, for her sake.

581
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:37,439
You`re drawing
attention to yourself.

582
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:39,506
I`m allowed to brood.

583
00:45:40,718 --> 00:45:42,515
My husband`s disappeared.

584
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:46,956
You`ll feel better
when the body surfaces.

585
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:48,252
Yeah.

586
00:45:48,325 --> 00:45:50,259
It always perks me up.

587
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:55,090
What do your saints say?

588
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:57,794
I`m brooding.

589
00:45:57,868 --> 00:45:59,335
I`m not praying.

590
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:02,065
Lost your faith, huh?

591
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:06,075
I never really had
any to begin with, I guess.

592
00:46:06,143 --> 00:46:08,407
Never believed in any of it--

593
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:11,915
God, the Virgin Mary,
that life begins at 40,

594
00:46:11,982 --> 00:46:14,780
and that people are all
just basically good inside.

595
00:46:14,852 --> 00:46:19,289
Pretty soon,
we`ll be the same person.

596
00:46:19,356 --> 00:46:21,824
See how nice things turned out?

597
00:46:24,995 --> 00:46:26,428
I`m going inside.

598
00:46:26,497 --> 00:46:28,590
You know, it wasn`t too smart

599
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,429
changing the food like that.

600
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:33,937
You never would have done that
if he was alive.

601
00:46:34,004 --> 00:46:35,437
Why kill him, then?

602
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:38,441
I like making it
better for the boys.

603
00:46:38,509 --> 00:46:40,943
Still, if it`s
all the same with you,

604
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:43,445
I`d rather not hang
for fried chicken.

605
00:46:43,514 --> 00:46:44,947
Why did you kill him?

606
00:46:45,015 --> 00:46:47,381
You could have left him.

607
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:49,578
You could have left here.

608
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:52,948
I was underestimated.

609
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:05,000
Stop looking at it.

610
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:06,502
People are watching us.

611
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,232
I can`t stand it much longer.

612
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:12,873
Finally.

613
00:47:14,145 --> 00:47:18,411
We`re going to have to get
the net from the shed.

614
00:47:18,482 --> 00:47:20,507
Who wants to go?

615
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:22,677
- Me!
- Me!

616
00:47:22,753 --> 00:47:24,380
Desantis?

617
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:27,522
Ohh!

618
00:47:27,591 --> 00:47:29,491
What are we
going to do now?

619
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,085
We`ll have
to drain the pool.

620
00:47:32,163 --> 00:47:33,687
I`ll get it.

621
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:34,924
No!

622
00:47:34,999 --> 00:47:35,931
Why not?

623
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,092
He`s a child.

624
00:47:37,168 --> 00:47:38,692
See if you can find it!

625
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:57,453
There`s something
down there.

626
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:12,162
It`s a lighter.

627
00:48:12,236 --> 00:48:13,430
Hey, that`s Dr. Baran`s.

628
00:48:13,504 --> 00:48:16,871
Remember the close-up
when he was playing with it?

629
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:18,738
Did you see anything else?

630
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:20,037
No.

631
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,408
That`s enough.
Go inside and change.

632
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:25,073
Take that up to
Dr. Baran`s office.

633
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:27,617
We`ll have to drain the pool.

634
00:48:27,685 --> 00:48:28,913
And refill it?

635
00:48:28,986 --> 00:48:30,920
That`s up to Dr. Baran.

636
00:48:30,988 --> 00:48:32,421
All right, everybody.
That`s enough.

637
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:36,425
Go on inside and get ready
and go back to class.

638
00:48:37,995 --> 00:48:39,929
Mia--

639
00:48:39,997 --> 00:48:42,431
Mr. Gannon,
will you drain the pool?

640
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:44,433
I`ve got orders not to.

641
00:48:44,501 --> 00:48:46,833
But my keys are in there.

642
00:48:46,904 --> 00:48:48,201
Please?

643
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:51,634
Right away, please.

644
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:56,606
Here`s the penis

645
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,444
and the scrotum
that holds the testicles,

646
00:48:59,516 --> 00:49:02,041
or testes, inside.

647
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,053
Now, when you`re around 1 4--

648
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:05,884
maybe sooner, maybe later--

649
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:09,983
the testes start making
a chemical substance called a hormone.

650
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,961
It`s this hormone
that causes the changes.

651
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:16,898
It starts hair growing
here under your arms

652
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:19,265
and on your face.

653
00:49:19,336 --> 00:49:22,203
Mr. Gannon, what is it?

654
00:49:22,273 --> 00:49:23,706
Something blocking the drain!

655
00:49:23,774 --> 00:49:26,402
Since you want
it done right away,

656
00:49:26,477 --> 00:49:28,445
I can`t help the noise.

657
00:49:33,484 --> 00:49:35,748
You all know what sperm is?

658
00:49:38,322 --> 00:49:41,018
Go on, Mr. Nuñez.

01:00:09,953 --> 01:00:11,215
Coffee, please.

844
01:00:13,623 --> 01:00:15,887
I saw you
at the sheriff`s station.

845
01:00:15,959 --> 01:00:18,553
I got your name
off the view request.

846
01:00:18,628 --> 01:00:20,289
Shirley Vogel.

847
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:23,527
You`re the police?

848
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,227
Cagney And Lacey.

849
01:00:25,302 --> 01:00:26,894
That kind of thing.

850
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:28,403
You know, they met with me once?

851
01:00:28,471 --> 01:00:29,403
Research stuff.

852
01:00:29,472 --> 01:00:30,404
Nice girls.

853
01:00:30,473 --> 01:00:33,408
I say ''girls.''
That O.K. with you?

854
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:34,966
Anyway...

855
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:36,478
flash forward 1 0 years,

856
01:00:36,546 --> 01:00:37,979
I`m on medical leave.

857
01:00:38,048 --> 01:00:39,481
The big ''C.''

858
01:00:39,549 --> 01:00:40,538
Air.

859
01:00:40,617 --> 01:00:42,608
I`m sorry.

860
01:00:42,686 --> 01:00:43,618
Ah, whatever.

861
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:45,245
I knew it was coming.

862
01:00:45,322 --> 01:00:48,382
My family--
never two boobs in a coffin.

863
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:51,621
I`m sorry, but I don`t
know why you`re here.

864
01:00:51,695 --> 01:00:53,424
Remember your husband?

865
01:00:55,865 --> 01:00:57,423
Uh...

866
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,991
could I get some coffee, please?

867
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,038
You mean--

868
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:03,834
I`m sure he`ll turn up.

869
01:01:03,907 --> 01:01:05,841
Yeah. Wrapped around
a pier apparently.

870
01:01:05,909 --> 01:01:07,809
You drove all the way from...

871
01:01:07,877 --> 01:01:10,311
That`s very kind of you, but...

872
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:12,314
Who the hell am I, right?

873
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:13,815
I don`t blame you.

874
01:01:13,883 --> 01:01:16,647
I know a guy
in the department in Hazelton.

875
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,655
I could call him,
he`ll visit, get the details.

876
01:01:19,723 --> 01:01:21,884
I don`t want
to make it official.

877
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:24,392
Suppose it`s just intentional.

878
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:25,894
[Waitress]
Here`s your coffee.

879
01:01:25,962 --> 01:01:28,226
Yeah. I know what you mean.

880
01:01:28,298 --> 01:01:29,560
Men.

881
01:01:31,968 --> 01:01:34,232
How do they sleep at night?

882
01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:37,898
They have sex.

883
01:01:37,974 --> 01:01:39,908
That`s how they sleep at night.

884
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:43,172
He might be home already.

885
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,212
This place.

886
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:46,213
Jesus.

887
01:01:46,282 --> 01:01:47,943
It`s no Sizzler, is it?

888
01:01:48,018 --> 01:01:50,714
He`ll be furious
if I`ve gone to the police.

889
01:01:50,787 --> 01:01:53,722
That`s what I`m trying to tell you.
Keep it private.

890
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:55,951
Once the boys
get their hooks into you...

891
01:01:56,026 --> 01:01:57,960
I couldn`t afford you.

892
01:01:58,028 --> 01:01:59,393
We run a school.

893
01:01:59,462 --> 01:02:00,554
A school?

894
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:02,564
Then you can forget the police.

895
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:05,100
You can`t afford
that kind of publicity.

896
01:02:05,168 --> 01:02:07,102
Look, 2, 3 days,

897
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:10,037
I chase him down
to some girlfriend`s house,

898
01:02:10,106 --> 01:02:12,597
and I scare the shit out of him.

899
01:02:12,675 --> 01:02:14,404
That wouldn`t be easy.

900
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:16,577
Look, I--

901
01:02:16,646 --> 01:02:18,341
I don`t want money.

902
01:02:19,482 --> 01:02:21,040
I mean, look at me.

903
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:22,880
I`m chasing all over
Pennsylvania

904
01:02:22,952 --> 01:02:24,385
for lunch dates

905
01:02:24,454 --> 01:02:27,389
with guys I couldn`t stand
1 0 years ago.

906
01:02:27,457 --> 01:02:29,550
Give me something to do.

907
01:02:32,962 --> 01:02:34,395
You ever smoke?

908
01:02:34,464 --> 01:02:35,829
No.

909
01:02:35,899 --> 01:02:37,161
Yeah.

910
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:38,530
Well...

911
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:40,228
look at this security system.

912
01:02:40,303 --> 01:02:41,736
You know, what is this,

913
01:02:41,805 --> 01:02:43,932
a piece of the true cross?

914
01:02:45,141 --> 01:02:46,608
Aren`t you hungry?

915
01:02:46,676 --> 01:02:48,075
Oh.

916
01:02:48,144 --> 01:02:50,442
I thought I should eat.

917
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:52,913
You know what your problem is?

918
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:55,583
You`re feeling guilty.

919
01:02:55,652 --> 01:02:57,415
No.

920
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:59,318
I`m not.

921
01:02:59,389 --> 01:03:01,357
It`s not your fault.

922
01:03:01,424 --> 01:03:03,085
It`s men.

923
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:05,093
Testosterone.

924
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:07,356
They should put it in bombs.

925
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:09,830
You want that?

926
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:04,349
Mrs. Baran would like me
to help...

927
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:05,785
informally.

928
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,557
Well, Ms. Vogel--
or is it detective?

929
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:13,151
Detective.

930
01:04:13,229 --> 01:04:14,662
Well, frankly, Detective,

931
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:16,995
I don`t think
we need to overreact.

932
01:04:17,066 --> 01:04:19,159
We`ve seen this before.

933
01:04:19,235 --> 01:04:20,668
We have?

934
01:04:22,872 --> 01:04:24,203
We, we, we.

935
01:04:24,274 --> 01:04:26,139
What is she,
the school nurse?

936
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:29,144
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

937
01:04:29,212 --> 01:04:31,407
Last Saturday.

938
01:04:32,482 --> 01:04:35,417
He was asleep
when we left at 7:00.

939
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:38,079
Nicole and I
drove out to her duplex.

940
01:04:38,154 --> 01:04:39,416
Oh, look!

941
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:41,753
This must be nice--
when it`s full.

942
01:04:41,824 --> 01:04:44,418
Isn`t it dangerous
keeping it empty like this?

943
01:04:44,494 --> 01:04:47,054
Yeah. Well, we lost
some keys in there.

944
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:49,325
We should get back
to our students.

945
01:04:49,399 --> 01:04:51,264
They`re on work crew this week.

946
01:04:51,334 --> 01:04:52,767
Yeah. So I noticed.

947
01:04:52,835 --> 01:04:55,770
Must save money,
having the kids keep up the place.

948
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:57,271
These older buildings.

949
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,900
None of his friends
know where he is?

950
01:04:59,976 --> 01:05:02,570
We haven`t asked them.
It`s kind of awkward.

951
01:05:02,645 --> 01:05:04,010
''Hey, my husband`s disappeared,

952
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,945
have you seen him?`` You know.

953
01:05:06,015 --> 01:05:07,505
Her husband.

954
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:09,518
It wouldn`t be awkward for me.

955
01:05:09,586 --> 01:05:11,019
If it`s O.K., Mrs. Baran,

956
01:05:11,087 --> 01:05:13,078
I`ll look at his address book.

957
01:05:13,156 --> 01:05:14,589
You know, Detective,

958
01:05:14,657 --> 01:05:17,148
I don`t think we need
to make a mountain

959
01:05:17,227 --> 01:05:18,660
out of a molehill.

960
01:05:18,728 --> 01:05:21,196
Exactly. Imagine
this place crawling with police.

961
01:05:21,264 --> 01:05:24,199
Wouldn`t be something
you`d write home about, would it?

962
01:05:24,267 --> 01:05:25,199
We`ll tiptoe.

963
01:05:25,268 --> 01:05:27,133
May I see your husband`s things?

964
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:28,465
Of course.

965
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:33,475
So nice meeting you,
Ms. Horner.

966

973
01:06:03,206 --> 01:06:05,140
I--I call her there sometimes

974
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:07,676
when she goes there on weekends.

978
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:13,341
Yeah.

979
01:06:14,851 --> 01:06:16,842
This goes through Monday.

980
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:19,888
He didn`t call you there
over the weekend?

981
01:06:19,956 --> 01:06:21,651
No.

982
01:06:21,724 --> 01:06:24,318
What kind of car
does your husband drive?

983
01:06:24,394 --> 01:06:27,329
We have one car--
the Cherokee.

984
01:06:27,397 --> 01:06:29,331
How did you break the taillight?

985
01:06:29,399 --> 01:06:31,833
I don`t know.
It happened a while ago.

986
01:06:32,602 --> 01:06:35,196
What was he wearing
when he disappeared?

987
01:06:35,271 --> 01:06:36,704
Um...

988
01:06:36,773 --> 01:06:38,331
his blue suit.

989
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:40,774
Could I see his closet?

990
01:06:40,843 --> 01:06:42,310
Yes.

991
01:06:46,616 --> 01:06:48,208
It`s missing.

992
01:06:48,284 --> 01:06:50,047
His blue suit...

993
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:52,883
and his belt
with the silver buckle.

994
01:06:52,955 --> 01:06:55,219
You just have to look
and you know.

995
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:56,588
Good for you.

996
01:06:56,659 --> 01:06:58,092

997
01:06:58,161 --> 01:07:00,095
and everything in its place.

998
01:07:01,164 --> 01:07:02,756
I hope we`re not too late.

999
01:07:02,832 --> 01:07:05,494
There`s video cameras out there.

1000
01:07:05,568 --> 01:07:07,001
Is that the news?

1001
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:10,005
Oh, no. It`s just
some PR for the school.

1002
01:07:10,073 --> 01:07:12,268
Is that all, Detective?
I`m really tired.

1003
01:07:12,342 --> 01:07:13,331
Of course.

1004

The address book?

1005
01:07:14,911 --> 01:07:16,845
It`s in his office.

1006
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:18,642
I`ll find it.

1007
01:07:21,084 --> 01:07:22,676
Oh, um...

1008
01:07:22,752 --> 01:07:24,185
it`s just one more thing.

1009
01:07:24,253 --> 01:07:26,847
That isn`t
the suit there, is it?

Like that topped my list--

1174
01:15:05,748 --> 01:15:07,181
God, please send me something

1175
01:15:07,249 --> 01:15:10,184
that`ll wear black nylon socks
to bed every night.

1176
01:15:10,252 --> 01:15:11,685
My idea of heaven

1177
01:15:11,754 --> 01:15:14,348
is a place where
they screw you barefoot.

1178
01:15:14,423 --> 01:15:16,687
I should pass
a hat for you.

1179
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:18,192
Don`t feel sorry for me.

1180
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:19,693
I got him to leave.

1181
01:15:19,762 --> 01:15:21,696
Every cloud has a silver lining.

1182
01:15:21,764 --> 01:15:23,698
He was too dull to kill.

1183
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:25,199
What about her?

1184
01:15:25,267 --> 01:15:27,201
She ever want to kill
her husband?

1185
01:15:27,269 --> 01:15:28,702
Why would she do that?

1186
01:15:28,771 --> 01:15:31,365
Maybe she found out
you were sleeping with him.

1187
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,771
Oh, that`s so clever.

1188
01:15:32,842 --> 01:15:35,777
What`d you do, ask
a faculty member or any student?

1189
01:15:35,845 --> 01:15:38,609
I know. You read it
in the brochure, right?

1190
01:15:38,681 --> 01:15:39,943
So she knew?

1191
01:15:40,015 --> 01:15:41,448
Of course she knew.

1192
01:15:41,517 --> 01:15:42,449
Ask her.

1193
01:15:42,518 --> 01:15:44,281
Come on,
she`s not a murderer.

1194
01:15:44,353 --> 01:15:46,617
She`s an ex-nun
for Christ`s sake.

1195
01:15:46,689 --> 01:15:48,122
Yeah. Remember them?

1196
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:51,125
They disappeared overnight
like dial phones.

1197
01:15:51,193 --> 01:15:53,889
What about you?
What if he wouldn`t leave her?

1198
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:56,898
Honey, if I couldn`t get
a man to leave her,

1199
01:15:56,966 --> 01:15:59,059
I wouldn`t kill him.
I`d kill myself.

1200
01:15:59,134 --> 01:16:00,999
Well, he has left her...

1201
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:02,002
apparently.

1202
01:16:02,071 --> 01:16:03,504
One way or another.

1203
01:16:05,241 --> 01:16:06,503

anything else...

Yeah, there is.
Just one more thing.

1206
01:16:11,914 --> 01:16:13,609
Guy did it barefoot.

''Did,'' Ms. Horner?

1208
01:16:17,686 --> 01:16:19,847
Don`t you mean ''does''?

1209
01:16:29,598 --> 01:16:30,895
Mrs. Baran?

1210
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:34,201
It`s dinner time, Erik.

1211
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:36,864
You should go inside
with the others.

1212
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:38,964
Are you O.K.?

1213
01:16:40,442 --> 01:16:42,307
You know the rules, Erik.

1214
01:16:42,378 --> 01:16:45,313
Your table won`t be able
to eat before you`re there.

1215
01:16:45,381 --> 01:16:47,315
It`s so much nicer here

1216
01:16:47,383 --> 01:16:48,941
since he left.

1217
01:16:49,018 --> 01:16:51,646
I hope he never comes back.

1218
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:01,662
Where did you find those?

1219
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:03,163
I found them yesterday.

1220
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:05,166
Give them to me.

1221
01:17:06,568 --> 01:17:09,162
They`re good, though.
They`re just a little rusty.

1223

Doesn`t mean anything.

1224
01:17:23,752 --> 01:17:25,185
The pool was empty,

1225
01:17:25,254 --> 01:17:27,848
and maybe he saw them
at the bottom.

1226
01:17:28,924 --> 01:17:30,653
I didn`t. Did you?

1227

If they were so plain
to see...

1228
01:17:34,096 --> 01:17:36,030
Don`t you see what it means?

1229
01:17:36,098 --> 01:17:38,032
Yeah. It means
we overlooked them.

1230
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,863
It means Guy`s watching us.

1231
01:17:39,935 --> 01:17:41,527
He`s alive.

1232
01:17:41,603 --> 01:17:42,729
He`s dead,

1233
01:17:42,805 --> 01:17:44,705
and I`m not sorry.

1234
01:17:46,108 --> 01:17:47,541
And neither are you,

1235
01:17:47,609 --> 01:17:49,702
if you`re really honest
with yourself.

1236
01:17:49,778 --> 01:17:51,871
Killing him
is a good thing--

1237
01:17:51,947 --> 01:17:53,972
like planting a tree.

1238
01:17:55,117 --> 01:17:56,709
Maybe there is a God.

So when the pool was empty,

1242
01:18:06,996 --> 01:18:09,931
I thought, maybe there is a God.

1243
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:12,490
And He knows what we did,

1244
01:18:12,568 --> 01:18:14,559
and He`s coming for us.

1245

It`s not God, honey.

1246
