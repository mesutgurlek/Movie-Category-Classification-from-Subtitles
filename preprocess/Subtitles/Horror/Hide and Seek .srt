1
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,333
Ready to go faster?

2
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:14,599
All right. No, no, no!

3
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,334
You're gonna slide off.

4
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:17,466
Oh!

5
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,442
You all right?

6
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:20,705
- Are you sliding?
- Yes.

7
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:23,407
No, if you're sliding,
I'm going to stop.

8
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:25,381
- No, no, no.
- You okay? Okay.

9
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:30,889
More?

10
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,890
Yes!

11
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:01,979
That's funny.

12
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,522
I could've sworn
I saw a little girl

13
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,252
by the name
of Emily come in here.

14
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,987
Come out, come out,

15
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:11,928
wherever you are...

16
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,625
Could she be hiding
in the closet?

17
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:22,029
I wonder where she could be.

18
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:29,680
Hmm...

19
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:33,047
Maybe my eyes
have deceived me.

20
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:36,644
I'm invisible, Mommy.

21
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,587
Well, if you're invisible...

22
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:43,721
...then how could I... do this?!

23
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,098
Did you know where I was?

24
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,066
Not a clue.

25
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,039
You want Alex?

26
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,910
What is it?

27
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:12,615
I love you more
than anything else in the world.

28
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,590
You know that, don't you?

29
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,263
I love you, too.

30
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,136
Good night, sweetheart.

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,501
Make the face.

32
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,037
Please.

33
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,984
- Now, go to sleep.
- Okay.

34
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:52,189
Mommy!

35
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,129
Sorry.

36
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,264
Good night.

37
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,112
You coming to bed?

38
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,950
In a little while.

39
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,392
Something you want to talk about?

40
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,891
Some things are beyond therapy, David.

41
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,154
Honey?

42
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,216
I should've seen it coming.

43
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,551
All the signs were there.

44
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,626
The ones closest to you
are the hardest to judge.

45
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:08,785
No, but I...

46
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:10,987
I could've prevented it.

47
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,655
David, it's not your fault.

48
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:16,895
How long have
we known each other?

49
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:20,029
Trust me when I tell you this.

50
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,630
As difficult
as it may seem, you're...

51
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,336
you're gonna have to try
and start over.

52
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:28,504
We're gonna move.

53
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,047
Upstate.

54
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,309
The country.

55
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,249
That's not exactly what
I meant by "starting over".

56
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,016
What about Emily?

57
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,561
This is a traumatic time for her.

58
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,325
I think it's important she stays
here and works through this.

59
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:47,865
No, here, she's
flooded with memories.

60
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,936
I need to expose her
to a new environment,

61
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,402
new things to do...

62
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,370
She'd be losing another person
she depends on.

63
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:58,338
It's only an hour away.

64
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,936
And... you're always welcome
to come and see her.

65
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:06,246
And right now, I need to do
what's right for Emily.

66
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,684
I need to be
a full-time dad.

67
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:20,732
I have a surprise for you.

68
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,403
When I was your age,
my mom gave me one just like that.

69
00:08:35,514 --> 00:08:38,779
And whenever I was feeling sad,

70
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:42,376
I would open the lid,
and all my sorrows went away.

71
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,285
Do you like it?

72
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:47,654
Give me a hug.

73
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,267
You're going to like it there.

74
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,800
All right, let's go.

75
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,698
Come on.

76
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,596
Let's take a look.

77
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:18,132
Right on time.

78
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,303
Dr. Callaway...

79
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:21,970
Mr. Haskins.

80
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,412
Hello.

81
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:24,880
This is Sheriff Hafferty.

82
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,042
Sheriff.

83
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:27,778
He routinely checks
on the houses up here

84
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,514
to make sure things
run smoothly.

85
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:30,646
I see. Well, this is

86
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,621
my daughter, Emily.
This is Sheriff Hafferty.

87
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:33,953
Emily.

88
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,619
How are you?

89
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,594
This is Mr. Haskins.

90
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,562
He found us the house.

91
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,226
Well, hello there, Emily.

92
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,793
Think your dad did a good job
picking the house?

93
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,008
She's still deciding.

94
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,977
Well, she sure is pretty.

95
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,274
Thank you.

96
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,940
As I mentioned,

97
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,415
Woodland Estates
is mainly

98
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,485
a summer community.

99
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,111
May be a little quiet
up here till then.

100
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,746
Hope that's not a problem.

101
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,688
- Not at all.
- Great.

102
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,316
Let me show you
around the back.

103
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,621
You ever spent

104
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,161
much time in the country?

105
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,457
Not much.

106
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:14,464
I used to camp
when I was little,

107
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:16,727
but I was always scared
of the woods.

108
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,530
Nothing to be scared of
in these woods.

109
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,867
Picked a nice spot.

110
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,703
Biggest house on the lake.

111
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:27,040
Sheriff, if you'd like
to do the honors;

112
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,808
let Dr. Callaway
into his new home.

113
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,439
Figure out which key...

114
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,781
Did you see where
my daughter went?

115
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,320
Emily!

116
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,515
Emily!

117
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,725
Emily!

118
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,667
Honey?

119
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,470
You okay?

120
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,575
Come on.
Let's go back.

121
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,980
Come on.

122
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,746
Come on.

123
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,654
Mr. Haskins, Sheriff...
we'll take it from here.

124
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,003
Spaghetti and meatballs
is your favorite dish.

125
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,604
You're not hungry?

126
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,531
I'd like to go to bed now.

127
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,733
I'll come up
and kiss you good night.

128
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,983
Oh, that's funny.

129
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,320
I could have sworn
I saw a little girl

130
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,054
by the name of Emily
come in here.

131
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,426
I wonder...

132
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,932
where she's hiding.

133
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:33,198
Could she be...
could she be...

134
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,772
under the bed?!

135
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:36,636
No.

136
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,869
Could she be...

137
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:41,969
hiding...

138
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:46,415
Let's see, where
could she be hiding?

139
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,112
Could she be
hiding in the... closet!

140
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,528
Okay...

141
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,800
since it's the first night
in a new house,

142
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:13,275
I thought it would be a good
time to start a new diary.

143
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:14,811
Each day you
can write down

144
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:16,471
your feelings
and thoughts,

145
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,913
and then, one day,
you can look back

146
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:19,347
and see
how much they've changed.

147
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,884
Hmm?

148
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,719
I love you more than anything
else in the world, sweetheart.

149
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,556
You know that.

150
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:33,859
That's what Mommy said.

151
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,661
Hmm?

152
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:39,635
Before she killed herself.

153
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,900
Sweetheart,
she meant what she said.

154
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,140
And so do I.

155
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,377
You want me to put this

156
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,384
over here?

157
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,717
Okay.

158
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,087
All right.

159
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,921
Good night.

160
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,668
Good night, Alex.

161
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:10,011
Emily? Emily!

162
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,953
Em?

163
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,931
Emily?

164
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,297
Oh, there you are.

165
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,132
Come on, sweetheart.

166
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,503
We're going into town.
We have some errands to do.

167
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,203
Oh...

168
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,804
Hello.

169
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,348
Hi... Hi, there.

170
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,816
L-I'm Laura.
I live next door.

171
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,750
Oh, I'm David.
How are you?

172
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:45,152
Uh, here.
These are for you.

173
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,952
Oh, thank you very much.

174
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,550
My husband and I made
the preserves ourselves.

175
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,458
Oh, well...

176
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,361
I didn't even realize
anyone else lived up here.

177
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,764
Well, it does get pretty quiet
in the off season.

178
00:18:58,503 --> 00:19:00,232
Oh, this is my
daughter, Emily.

179
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,864
Emily, say hello to Laura.

180
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:04,032
She's our neighbor.

181
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,609
Isn't she adorable?

182
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,906
You going to say hi?

183
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,710
Well, she gets a little shy

184
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,875
around new faces.

185
00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:14,315
I understand.

186
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,547
It's going to be a real treat
having both of you here.

187
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:23,051
Oh, you're on your way out.

188
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,560
I won't keep you.

189
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,097
Um, if you need anything,
don't hesitate to stop by.

190
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,223
Same here.

191
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,994
And thank you
for all the preserves.

192
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,763
The peach and apricot preserves.

193
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,269
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

194
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:35,567
I'm gonna put this inside.

195
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,814
Amy, don't swing so high.

196
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:52,253
I'm going
to tell your mom.

197
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:09,432
Would you listen to me?

198
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,655
Hi.

199
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,918
Hi.

200
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,257
I have, uh,
a daughter the same age.

201
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:33,962
She's in the car.

202
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,659
Oh.

203
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,861
I'm Elizabeth.

204
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,495
Elizabeth Young.

205
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:44,040
Hi.
David Callaway.

206
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,200
- How are you?
- Good.

207
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,607
Nice to meet you.

208
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:48,110
Are you visiting?

209
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,681
Just moved up
from the city.

210
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,272
Oh, usually it's
the other way around.

211
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,113
I know.

212
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,055
She your kid?

213
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,817
Oh, no. No.

214
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,552
She's my sister's kid.

215
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,457
I'm the honorary baby-sitter.

216
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,052
Watch.

217
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,994
Amy, be careful.

218
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:09,157
Amy...

219
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,597
Oh...

220
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,672
- Amy.
- She all right?

221
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,333
Amy, Jesus,
are you all right?

222
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,004
That's very funny.

223
00:21:22,113 --> 00:21:23,705
Oh, my God, you're
going to make me nuts,

224
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:24,839
you know that?

225
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,844
Is your daughter
this crazy?

226
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,590
Where's Alex?

227
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,165
I don't like her anymore.

228
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,232
Did I just hear
what I think I heard?

229
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,998
Are you mad, Daddy?

230
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,766
No, I'm not mad at all, honey.

231
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:49,841
I think it's great.

232
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:50,908
You do?

233
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,340
Yeah.

234
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,378
Good.

235
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,380
Because I have a new friend.

236
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,576
A new friend? Okay.

237
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:03,449
Let me guess.
Is it, um...

238
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:04,715
Veronica?

239
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,586
No.

240
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:08,955
Uh, is it, uh, Patty?

241
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:11,959
Is it...

242
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:13,189
He's not a doll.

243
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,157
He's...

244
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,736
Not a doll.

245
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,236
He.

246
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:22,568
Okay, well,

247
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,268
if he's not a doll,
then who is he?

248
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,140
He doesn't want me
to talk about him.

249
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,405
Doesn't want you
to talk about him?

250
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,844
No.

251
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,176
Well, what if I promise

252
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,875
to keep it a secret,
could you tell me then?

253
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,255
So, what's his name?

254
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,758
He told me to call him Charlie.

255
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,659
Charlie? Oh, that's
an interesting name.

256
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,493
Charlie.

257
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,499
When did you meet Charlie?

258
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,590
Today.

259
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,636
When we went to town?

260
00:22:52,737 --> 00:22:55,001
It was before that.

261
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:57,666
Before that. Huh.

262
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:02,475
Is he... here right now?

263
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,252
I think he's sleeping.

264
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:11,619
Okay.

265
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,748
Well, in that case,

266
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:16,190
we better not wake him, hmm?

267
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:18,489
It's not unusual

268
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,191
for a traumatized child
to create imaginary friends.

269
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,995
I know, I just wish
she'd confide in me

270
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,660
instead of using fantasy.

271
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,101
Trauma causes pain.

272
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:30,140
Eventually the mind
will find a way to release it.

273
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:31,469
No kidding.

274
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,510
Don't forget: I'm the one
who taught you that stuff.

275
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,671
As a matter of fact, you did, yes.

276
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,873
Just have fun with her, David.

277
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,280
Play with her.

278
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,443
That's what she needs.

279
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:21,156
These are beginner rods.

280
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:29,257
Let's see... two rods,

281
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,927
$41.50 each...

282
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:46,911
Plus bait and tackle...

283
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,246
Sheriff.

284
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,726
You parked in a handicap zone.

285
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,296
Oh, I didn't even realize.

286
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,393
Could you give me a break?
I didn't realize.

287
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,374
Enjoy your day.

288
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,779
Eh, so much for

289
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,282
small town
hospitality, honey.

290
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,977
- Shut the door.
- We broke the law.

291
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:24,021
I know we broke the law.

292
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:25,419
Shut the door.

293
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,196
The Loch Ness Monster.

294
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,457
What?

295
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,964
You know what that is?

296
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,364
It's in Scotland.

297
00:25:39,904 --> 00:25:42,031
This is a good spot, huh?

298
00:26:07,031 --> 00:26:09,158
Honey, what are you doing?

299
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,002
You think that's a good idea?

300
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,270
Emily, we have bait.

301
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,111
See?

302
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:31,518
All right.

303
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,222
Did you have
a nice time today?

304
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:38,761
It was okay.

305
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,854
Just okay?

306
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:42,660
Mm...

307
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,497
Well, then, what could we
have done to make it better?

308
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,698
What if Charlie was there?

309
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,606
Would he have made it better?

310
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,146
He's a lot of fun.

311
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,544
Fun like how?

312
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:03,215
Fun like Mommy.

313
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:12,922
It's a little stuffy in here.

314
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,073
It's stuck.

315
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,519
It's okay, Daddy.

316
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,055
It just...

317
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,635
...three, two, one...

318
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,469
Happy New Year!

319
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,515
Emily, why would you do this?

320
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,218
I didn't do it.

321
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,920
What do you mean,
you didn't do it?

322
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,291
There's nobody here but us.

323
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:28,058
It wasn't me.

324
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,459
This is your writing,
and these are your crayons, honey.

325
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:35,966
It's all right. Just tell me.

326
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,200
You don't have to lie to me.

327
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,707
I'm not lying.

328
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,801
Okay, well,
if you didn't do it,

329
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,573
then who did?

330
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:46,546
It was Charlie.

331
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,989
She thinks I'm responsible

332
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,252
She thinks I'm responsible

333
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,621
for Alison's death.

334
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,924
It's Charlie
that holds you responsible.

335
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,292
Use him, David.

336
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,263
Use him to get through to her.

337
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,028
He's the key.

338
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,831
L-I have to go, I...

339
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,031
I think I found her
a real friend.

340
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,539
Really? That's great.

341
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:11,801
Call me if you need me, okay?

342
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:13,501
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

343
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,607
Hi.

344
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:18,682
- Hi.
- Hi.

345
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:19,772
Hi, Amy.

346
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,612
Glad you came.

347
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,918
Em... we have guests.

348
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,925
Emily?

349
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,760
This is Elizabeth.

350
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:37,892
Hi, Emily.

351
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,299
Emily, this is Amy.

352
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,201
Hi.

353
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,102
Hi.

354
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:47,769
Coffee-maker
has a mind of its own.

355
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,437
Oh, God...

356
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,151
Thank you.

357
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,592
So, is that your wife?

358
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,723
She passed away.

359
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,430
I'm sorry.

360
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,668
No matter how many times I say it,
it still sounds so strange.

361
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,606
Must be hard on Emily.

362
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,440
Have you ever been married?

363
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,174
Actually, I just got divorced.

364
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,147
I'm living with my sister

365
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,708
and her husband till I can
figure out my next move.

366
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:35,487
Best way to get over the past
is to start something new.

367
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,653
That's why we're here.

368
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,229
...baby, wrap it up

369
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,891
in toilet paper,
put it in the incubator.

370
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:46,026
What shall it be?

371
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:49,129
Oh! By the way,
this is Penelope.

372
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,867
Thanks.

373
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,375
You're gonna like it here.

374
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,742
It's a lot of fun.

375
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,179
Well, it's not always fun,

376
00:31:58,282 --> 00:32:01,740
but there are lots
of fun things to do.

377
00:32:03,654 --> 00:32:05,349
Oh...

378
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,981
She's beautiful.

379
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,951
What's her name?

380
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,633
Well, you don't talk much,
do you?

381
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:21,034
You shouldn't be here.

382
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,470
Why not?

383
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,438
You could get hurt.

384
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,219
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

385
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,915
So, um... so,
you have my number.

386
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,719
I'll talk to you soon.

387
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:42,850
Okay...

388
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,019
I guess I should go.

389
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,460
- Yeah.
- Okay.

390
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:47,792
- Bye.
- Bye.

391
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:53,426
Bye, Emily.

392
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,375
So... what'd you
think of Amy?

393
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,282
Did you like her?

394
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,413
I don't need any more friends.

395
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,005
Good, good.

396
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,167
There.

397
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,471
Perfect.

398
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,738
Hi.

399
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:10,313
Hey. Sorry.

400
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:12,143
I didn't mean to intrude.

401
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,308
Oh, uh...

402
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:14,475
I'm Steven.

403
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:15,745
Laura's husband from next door.

404
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:16,911
Oh, yeah. Hi.

405
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,454
It's David, right?

406
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,183
Yes, it's David.

407
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,282
Just wanted to say hi.

408
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,623
Nice to...
nice to meet you, Steven.

409
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,991
Figured, you know...

410
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,258
gonna be neighbors,
you might as well be neighborly, right?

411
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,129
Right.

412
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,203
Uh... well, you're gonna have
to excuse us, Steven.

413
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:34,293
We have a busy day

414
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,169
ahead of us.
Honey, come on.

415
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,509
Emily...

416
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,943
let's go.

417
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:47,774
Bye.

418
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:52,288
Listen, you need anything,

419
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,982
just give a shout, will you?

420
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:56,992
Okay. Thank you.
See you around.

421
00:34:57,094 --> 00:34:58,220
David?

422
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,557
Yeah?

423
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:05,494
You're very lucky to have
such a beautiful daughter.

424
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,538
Thank you.

425
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,479
You remember
what I told you

426
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:23,450
about not talking
to strangers?

427
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:24,851
He's not a stranger.

428
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:25,944
What do you mean?

429
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,285
He's our neighbor.

430
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,655
As far as I'm concerned,
he's a stranger, honey.

431
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,728
Don't walk away
when I'm talking to you.

432
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:32,989
I'm telling you something.

433
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,156
I'm sorry, Daddy.
Weren't you finished?

434
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,290
No, I wasn't finished.

435
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,265
What I'm saying is,
it's very important

436
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,360
for you to listen
when I tell you something.

437
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,495
Okay.

438
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:43,129
Okay?

439
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:25,780
What are you doing,
sweetheart?

440
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:26,941
Nothing.

441
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,313
What's so funny?

442
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,149
Is Charlie here?

443
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,654
He just left.

444
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,315
Where'd he go?

445
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,194
Did you open that?

446
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:46,292
I thought you did.

447
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,039
I want to talk to Charlie.

448
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,732
What would you like
to talk about?

449
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,470
I'd like to talk to him
about all sorts of things.

450
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,602
Like what?

451
00:37:28,712 --> 00:37:32,944
Like, uh... well,
what makes him happy...

452
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,349
what makes him sad...

453
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,512
So, what do you say?

454
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:40,351
You think you can introduce us?

455
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,653
I don't think that's going to work.

456
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,784
Why's that?

457
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,692
He doesn't like you very much.

458
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:50,198
Oh, why doesn't he
like me very much?

459
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:53,793
Does it have something
to do with Mommy?

460
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,963
Honey?

461
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:01,135
What does he tell you?

462
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,328
...three, one thousand,

463
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,694
four, one thousand,

464
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,893
five, one thousand,

465
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,492
six, one thousand,

466
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:27,935
seven, one thousand,

467
00:38:28,038 --> 00:38:29,630
eight, one thousand,

468
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,264
nine, one thousand,

469
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,842
ten, one thousand.

470
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:37,607
Ready or not, here I come.

471
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,534
Charlie...

472
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,739
Charlie...

473
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:36,471
Charlie...

474
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:44,107
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

475
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,646
Charlie?

476
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,915
Is that you?

477
00:41:05,295 --> 00:41:06,922
Emily!

478
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:09,726
Emily!

479
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,111
Emily!

480
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,711
Where are you?

481
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,709
What happened?

482
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,911
Why are you down here?

483
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,921
Emily, talk to me.

484
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,957
He was hiding.

485
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:35,957
Who was hiding?

486
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,391
In the dark.

487
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,897
Can I go to bed now?

488
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,389
Hi.

489
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,551
Hi.

490
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,561
Do you have a minute?

491
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:16,099
Yeah. Oh, sure.
Come on in.

492
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,862
Thank you. Thank you.

493
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,973
I wanted to apologize

494
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,201
for my husband.

495
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,301
He said he had a...
awkward moment

496
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,107
yesterday
with you and Emily.

497
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,476
That's all right.
Don't worry about it.

498
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,607
He's harmless, really.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

499
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,776
That's fine.

500
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,945
It's just that...

501
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:41,821
we lost a child recently...
a girl...

502
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:46,692
and in some ways,
Emily reminds us of her.

503
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:50,096
I see.

504
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,328
He was just... reaching out. Hmm?

505
00:42:57,407 --> 00:43:01,309
There is nothing worse
in this world than losing a child.

506
00:43:45,418 --> 00:43:46,885
Here, taste this.

507
00:43:46,986 --> 00:43:48,977
I think it may be too salty.

508
00:43:49,088 --> 00:43:50,146
Oh. Okay.

509
00:43:52,892 --> 00:43:53,916
- Not bad.
- Really?

510
00:43:54,026 --> 00:43:56,085
- Not bad.
- Oh, good.

511
00:43:56,195 --> 00:43:57,992
Really good.

512
00:43:59,865 --> 00:44:02,993
Wow! You look so pretty.

513
00:44:03,102 --> 00:44:06,230
You didn't have to get
all dressed up for me.

514
00:44:07,873 --> 00:44:09,170
Honey, would you go upstairs

515
00:44:09,275 --> 00:44:11,106
and change
into something else, please?

516
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,542
Don't you like it?

517
00:44:13,646 --> 00:44:16,410
Not for dinner, no.

518
00:44:16,515 --> 00:44:17,743
Why not?

519
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,579
You know why.

520
00:44:19,685 --> 00:44:22,279
She looks so pretty.
Let's just eat.

521
00:44:22,388 --> 00:44:25,846
I think you look
really beautiful.

522
00:44:38,737 --> 00:44:41,706
Did Daddy tell you
that my mommy died?

523
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:47,071
Yes, he did.

524
00:44:47,179 --> 00:44:48,271
And I'm very sorry.

525
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,938
Did he tell you
how she died?

526
00:44:50,049 --> 00:44:53,314
Honey, I don't think Elizabeth
really wants to hear

527
00:44:53,419 --> 00:44:54,613
how that happened,
okay?

528
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,812
She killed herself
in our bathtub.

529
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:57,388
- Emily...
- Slit her wrists with a razor.

530
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,549
Emily.

531
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:02,627
That's enough.

532
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,827
Emily, I brought you something.

533
00:45:09,935 --> 00:45:12,460
Your dad asked me to bring over

534
00:45:12,571 --> 00:45:14,004
some of Amy's books.

535
00:45:14,106 --> 00:45:16,097
These were some
of my favorites

536
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:18,176
when I was your age.

537
00:45:18,277 --> 00:45:20,268
Oh, that's great.

538
00:45:20,379 --> 00:45:23,075
Give you a chance to see
what the other kids are reading

539
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:24,171
before you get started.

540
00:45:24,283 --> 00:45:26,808
You gonna say thanks?

541
00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:32,220
Emily...

542
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:37,828
Emily... Emily, stop it.
That's enough.

543
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:39,329
Do you like her, Daddy?

544
00:45:39,431 --> 00:45:40,955
- Stop this.
- Charlie says you do.

545
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:42,966
- Go to your room.
- He says you like her

546
00:45:43,068 --> 00:45:44,660
- as much as Mommy.
- Go to your room. To your room.

547
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:47,034
If you're going to behave
this way, go to your room.

548
00:45:48,474 --> 00:45:50,704
Let's hope you don't
wind up like her.

549
00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:04,787
I'm sorry.

550
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:05,822
Who's Charlie?

551
00:46:05,925 --> 00:46:08,553
Oh, he's her imaginary friend.

552
00:46:08,661 --> 00:46:10,390
Her only friend.

553
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:20,203
I always wanted her to have
a better childhood than I had.

554
00:46:20,306 --> 00:46:22,035
Now look.

555
00:46:27,279 --> 00:46:29,179
Drive safely.

556
00:46:56,842 --> 00:46:59,037
Attention, please!

557
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:06,278
Maybe after
a few more martinis...

558
00:48:25,264 --> 00:48:27,164
Charlie did it.

559
00:48:28,267 --> 00:48:30,258
You do believe me,
don't you, Daddy?

560
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:32,769
Why are you looking at me
like that?

561
00:48:53,092 --> 00:48:54,150
Mr. Callaway.

562
00:48:54,259 --> 00:48:55,851
I didn't mean to disturb you.

563
00:48:57,763 --> 00:49:00,163
Thought you might
be needing these.

564
00:49:08,574 --> 00:49:10,166
Those are the keys
for the, uh,

565
00:49:10,275 --> 00:49:12,334
different rooms in the house.

566
00:49:12,444 --> 00:49:14,935
I forgot to give them
to you earlier.

567
00:49:15,047 --> 00:49:16,674
I apologize.

568
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:21,379
It's a little late to be
delivering keys, isn't it?

569
00:49:21,487 --> 00:49:24,251
Well, I thought I could slip
them under the door.

570
00:49:24,356 --> 00:49:26,847
Wife and I are going

571
00:49:26,959 --> 00:49:29,257
to Canada first thing
in the morning.

572
00:49:29,361 --> 00:49:32,455
We've got a little cabin
tucked away in the woods.

573
00:49:32,564 --> 00:49:35,897
Good place to clear the mind.

574
00:49:38,437 --> 00:49:40,064
Everything all right?

575
00:49:44,777 --> 00:49:47,211
Well, enjoy.

576
00:50:36,094 --> 00:50:39,063
What's for breakfast?

577
00:50:51,376 --> 00:50:54,971
Honey, why would Charlie
do such a horrible thing?

578
00:50:59,985 --> 00:51:01,247
Is it because of Elizabeth?

579
00:51:04,756 --> 00:51:07,054
Charlie needs to understand
something, honey.

580
00:51:07,159 --> 00:51:09,992
Elizabeth is not trying
to take Mommy's place.

581
00:51:10,095 --> 00:51:11,653
Does he understand that?

582
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:15,322
Honey, I can't help you

583
00:51:15,434 --> 00:51:17,368
if you don't talk to me.

584
00:51:20,472 --> 00:51:22,838
Why doesn't he like Elizabeth?

585
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:24,932
Because she likes you.

586
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:26,442
And?

587
00:51:26,545 --> 00:51:29,514
He doesn't want you to be happy.

588
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:34,912
Honey...

589
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,454
you know this has nothing
to do with Charlie.

590
00:51:37,556 --> 00:51:38,887
You do know that.

591
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:42,483
It's about you, honey.

592
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:44,221
And that's okay.

593
00:51:46,365 --> 00:51:48,196
Charlie doesn't exist.

594
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,825
You shouldn't say that.

595
00:51:50,936 --> 00:51:51,994
Why not?

596
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:56,234
You're going to make him mad.

597
00:51:56,341 --> 00:51:58,741
Oh, well, so what?

598
00:51:58,844 --> 00:52:00,141
I'll get him mad.

599
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:02,372
Let him come out
and yell at me. Good.

600
00:52:02,481 --> 00:52:04,415
I want to see him.
Where is he?

601
00:52:04,516 --> 00:52:07,076
You want to see him?

602
00:52:26,138 --> 00:52:29,266
Who's that supposed to be?

603
00:52:29,374 --> 00:52:31,638
Charlie and Mommy.

604
00:52:31,743 --> 00:52:33,176
She would have liked him.

605
00:52:33,278 --> 00:52:35,542
No, trust me, honey.

606
00:52:35,647 --> 00:52:38,115
Mommy wouldn't like Charlie.

607
00:52:38,216 --> 00:52:41,708
That's not what he says.

608
00:52:45,023 --> 00:52:46,752
What do you mean?

609
00:52:49,661 --> 00:52:52,562
What do you mean?
What does he say?

610
00:52:52,664 --> 00:52:55,394
What does he say?

611
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,831
What does Charlie say?

612
00:52:56,935 --> 00:52:58,766
Talk to me.
What does he say?

613
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,361
He says he would
have satisfied her.

614
00:53:04,476 --> 00:53:05,602
Who told you to say that?

615
00:53:05,711 --> 00:53:07,110
Charlie did.

616
00:53:07,212 --> 00:53:09,271
No, who...
who told you that?

617
00:53:09,381 --> 00:53:10,279
Charlie did.

618
00:53:10,382 --> 00:53:12,111
There is no Charlie.
Who said it?

619
00:53:12,217 --> 00:53:13,206
Charlie did!

620
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:14,285
He did not. Who said it?

621
00:53:14,386 --> 00:53:16,877
Charlie! Charlie!

622
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:19,480
Charlie! Charlie!

623
00:53:19,591 --> 00:53:20,615
Charlie! Charlie!

624
00:53:20,726 --> 00:53:23,593
Charlie! Charlie!

625
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:31,336
Hey...

626
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:34,900
Hey, sweetheart.

627
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:36,235
I'm so happy you came.

628
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:38,468
It's so good to see you.

629
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:42,910
Want to show me the house?

630
00:53:43,015 --> 00:53:44,004
Yeah.

631
00:53:44,116 --> 00:53:45,913
Okay.

632
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:47,918
Hey, David.
How are you?

633
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,146
Good.
Good to see you.

634
00:53:49,254 --> 00:53:50,448
Good to see you, too.

635
00:53:50,555 --> 00:53:52,853
Glad you could come.

636
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,189
Do you like it here?

637
00:53:57,295 --> 00:53:59,024
I'm having a lot of fun.

638
00:53:59,131 --> 00:54:02,396
You are?

639
00:54:02,501 --> 00:54:06,460
Tell me about
your friend Charlie.

640
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:09,438
He doesn't like me
to talk about him.

641
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:12,101
I'm sure he wouldn't mind
if you told me.

642
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,614
Tell me, what do you
guys do together?

643
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:19,206
Play games.

644
00:54:19,317 --> 00:54:20,875
What kind of games?

645
00:54:20,986 --> 00:54:23,216
Hide and seek.

646
00:54:23,321 --> 00:54:25,050
That's our favorite.

647
00:54:25,157 --> 00:54:28,786
Sounds like Charlie's
a lot of fun.

648
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:35,756
So what do you guys talk about?

649
00:54:35,867 --> 00:54:36,834
I don't know.

650
00:54:36,935 --> 00:54:38,562
Bunch of things.

651
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:42,037
Sometimes he even
talks about you.

652
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:47,005
Really.

653
00:54:47,112 --> 00:54:48,739
And what does he say?

654
00:54:52,551 --> 00:54:54,018
You can tell me.

655
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:57,418
He's afraid you're
going to get in the way.

656
00:54:57,522 --> 00:55:00,389
In the...
In the way of what?

657
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:02,858
Our game.

658
00:55:02,961 --> 00:55:05,259
What game is that?

659
00:55:05,363 --> 00:55:08,264
Upsetting Daddy.

660
00:55:12,971 --> 00:55:15,166
Isn't she pretty?

661
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:20,003
David, I'd like
to bring Emily back with me.

662
00:55:20,112 --> 00:55:22,546
At least for a little while,
so she can be evaluated.

663
00:55:22,647 --> 00:55:26,777
I'm just worried bringing her back
will make her worse.

664
00:55:26,885 --> 00:55:27,909
She's not well.

665
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:29,281
I know that.

666
00:55:29,387 --> 00:55:31,116
And she's not your patient.

667
00:55:31,223 --> 00:55:34,192
I know that, too.

668
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:35,554
She thinks it's a game.

669
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:37,685
She's using Charlie
to get to you.

670
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:38,785
I know things

671
00:55:38,897 --> 00:55:40,626
haven't gone
as well as we hoped, but...

672
00:55:40,732 --> 00:55:43,030
do you really think
bringing her back to New York

673
00:55:43,135 --> 00:55:45,103
is going to make
that much of a difference?

674
00:55:45,203 --> 00:55:46,795
It's worth a try.

675
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:51,234
All right, look.

676
00:55:51,343 --> 00:55:53,903
I'll give it two more weeks,

677
00:55:54,012 --> 00:55:55,775
and if there's no improvement,
I'll bring her back.

678
00:57:40,819 --> 00:57:42,844
What are you doing, Daddy?

679
00:57:42,954 --> 00:57:44,387
Nothing.

680
00:57:44,489 --> 00:57:47,390
What were you looking at?

681
00:57:47,492 --> 00:57:50,586
No, I was just getting
ready to tuck you in.

682
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,334
Good night.

683
00:58:13,051 --> 00:58:14,541
Daddy?

684
00:58:16,421 --> 00:58:18,286
Yeah, sweetheart?

685
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,415
Can you close the door?

686
00:58:22,694 --> 00:58:23,922
You don't want the light?

687
00:58:24,029 --> 00:58:27,294
I don't need it anymore.

688
00:58:31,336 --> 00:58:32,462
Okay.

689
00:59:58,757 --> 01:00:00,452
Hi.

690
01:00:00,558 --> 01:00:03,152
Hello. David.

691
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:05,559
I thought I'd return the favor.

692
01:00:05,663 --> 01:00:09,030
Oh, thank you.

693
01:00:10,335 --> 01:00:11,996
Mmm! Apple!

694
01:00:12,103 --> 01:00:13,900
My favorite!

695
01:00:14,005 --> 01:00:15,905
You can make yourself at home.

696
01:00:16,007 --> 01:00:17,065
I'll be back in a second.

697
01:00:17,175 --> 01:00:18,199
Thank you.

698
01:00:59,184 --> 01:01:00,879
You must think
we're pretty crazy

699
01:01:00,985 --> 01:01:02,885
keeping all these toys around.

700
01:01:05,356 --> 01:01:07,051
It's, um...

701
01:01:07,158 --> 01:01:11,185
It's hard to find the right
place for them, you know?

702
01:01:22,407 --> 01:01:25,035
I'm sorry.

703
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:26,701
No, you have nothing
to be sorry about.

704
01:01:26,811 --> 01:01:29,143
It's just, I...

705
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:31,943
I've had no one to talk to.

706
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,644
You know that
I am a psychologist.

707
01:01:34,752 --> 01:01:37,152
I've dealt with many people

708
01:01:37,255 --> 01:01:38,916
in similar
circumstances,

709
01:01:39,023 --> 01:01:40,991
and if you
and your husband

710
01:01:41,092 --> 01:01:43,788
would like to talk about this,
it might help.

711
01:01:43,895 --> 01:01:46,455
He's... been having...

712
01:01:46,564 --> 01:01:48,589
a tough time
this past couple of weeks.

713
01:01:50,034 --> 01:01:53,800
In-In... wh-what sense?

714
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:58,568
You have no idea
how painful it can be.

715
01:01:58,676 --> 01:02:00,507
How painful

716
01:02:00,612 --> 01:02:03,172
he can make it.

717
01:02:08,486 --> 01:02:10,920
I'm sorry.

718
01:02:11,022 --> 01:02:12,785
I've already said too much.

719
01:02:12,891 --> 01:02:13,858
Please, I can...

720
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:15,619
Listen to me.
Please, I can help you.

721
01:02:15,727 --> 01:02:17,285
No, he'll be back any moment.

722
01:02:17,395 --> 01:02:19,625
You just talk to me.
I can help you.

723
01:02:19,731 --> 01:02:21,289
No.

724
01:02:21,399 --> 01:02:22,696
You have to go.

725
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:23,789
Wha...?

726
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:58,900
Hello?

727
01:02:59,003 --> 01:03:01,403
David?

728
01:03:12,517 --> 01:03:14,485
Emily?

729
01:03:38,142 --> 01:03:40,337
Hello?

730
01:03:43,114 --> 01:03:44,581
David?

731
01:03:47,552 --> 01:03:49,076
Emily?

732
01:03:54,192 --> 01:03:56,456
Emily, are you in here?

733
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:02,857
Didn't you hear me calling?

734
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:05,561
Daddy's not here.

735
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:09,128
Well, actually, it was you
that I came to see.

736
01:04:11,242 --> 01:04:13,904
Would you mind
if we talked for a moment?

737
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:19,882
I brought you some daisies.

738
01:04:21,686 --> 01:04:23,449
I wasn't sure which one
was your favorite color,

739
01:04:23,554 --> 01:04:25,920
so I just...
got all kinds.

740
01:04:29,794 --> 01:04:32,558
Thanks.

741
01:04:36,234 --> 01:04:37,599
Emily, I'm really sorry

742
01:04:37,702 --> 01:04:40,136
about what happened
the other night.

743
01:04:40,238 --> 01:04:42,502
I want you to know
that I'm not trying

744
01:04:42,607 --> 01:04:44,097
to come between
you and your dad.

745
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:47,234
Do you think maybe
we could start over?

746
01:04:47,345 --> 01:04:51,304
We could be friends?

747
01:04:51,416 --> 01:04:54,249
Do you like games?

748
01:04:54,352 --> 01:04:56,980
I love games.

749
01:04:57,088 --> 01:05:00,649
Would you like to play one?

750
01:05:00,758 --> 01:05:04,421
I'm already playing.

751
01:05:04,529 --> 01:05:07,430
What game are you playing?

752
01:05:07,532 --> 01:05:10,296
Hide and seek.

753
01:05:11,869 --> 01:05:13,962
Don't you need another person
to play that game?

754
01:05:14,072 --> 01:05:16,097
He's hiding.

755
01:05:16,207 --> 01:05:20,200
Who's hiding?

756
01:05:20,311 --> 01:05:22,370
Charlie.

757
01:05:24,649 --> 01:05:26,844
Charlie's hiding.

758
01:05:26,951 --> 01:05:28,851
Where's he hiding?

759
01:05:42,433 --> 01:05:45,027
You stay here.

760
01:05:48,673 --> 01:05:51,039
Charlie...

761
01:05:51,142 --> 01:05:54,111
Come out, come out,
wherever you are...

762
01:05:56,581 --> 01:05:57,741
No!

763
01:06:13,664 --> 01:06:15,529
Emily?

764
01:06:15,633 --> 01:06:18,727
Em?

765
01:06:56,007 --> 01:06:57,975
Emily?

766
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:03,513
What are you doing?

767
01:07:04,715 --> 01:07:06,945
What are you drawing, honey?

768
01:07:26,237 --> 01:07:27,636
What happened?

769
01:07:27,738 --> 01:07:28,932
Emily,

770
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,405
what happened?

771
01:07:49,827 --> 01:07:50,851
Oh, hello, Sheriff.

772
01:07:53,064 --> 01:07:55,532
Mind if I come in
for a minute?

773
01:07:59,937 --> 01:08:01,837
Afraid I have some bad news.

774
01:08:01,939 --> 01:08:03,270
There's been an accident.

775
01:08:03,374 --> 01:08:06,502
I found Elizabeth Young's car
crashed on the side of the road.

776
01:08:06,611 --> 01:08:07,805
Is she okay?

777
01:08:07,912 --> 01:08:08,970
I don't know.

778
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,240
She wasn't inside.

779
01:08:10,348 --> 01:08:11,406
I spoke to her niece Amy.

780
01:08:11,515 --> 01:08:12,539
Uh-huh.

781
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:14,641
She told me
she came up here to see you.

782
01:08:14,752 --> 01:08:15,878
You seen her?

783
01:08:15,987 --> 01:08:17,318
No, I haven't seen her.

784
01:08:17,421 --> 01:08:19,685
No.

785
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:22,315
Would you mind...

786
01:08:22,426 --> 01:08:23,757
I had a glass of water?

787
01:08:23,861 --> 01:08:25,021
Sure, uh...

788
01:08:25,129 --> 01:08:26,221
Just want, uh,

789
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:28,127
- water, uh...?
- Yeah.

790
01:08:28,232 --> 01:08:30,393
Sure.

791
01:08:34,672 --> 01:08:36,105
At first, I thought

792
01:08:36,207 --> 01:08:38,903
she might have crashed
on the way up.

793
01:08:42,346 --> 01:08:43,973
But taking a second look.

794
01:08:45,182 --> 01:08:47,548
I seen the tire tracks
leading down the hill.

795
01:08:49,987 --> 01:08:52,319
So, she must have
at least stopped by.

796
01:08:54,525 --> 01:08:56,516
Well, maybe she
forgot something,

797
01:08:56,627 --> 01:08:57,719
or turned around, or

798
01:08:57,828 --> 01:08:58,920
I don't know,
but, uh...

799
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:01,225
Maybe, uh...
Maybe Emily's seen her.

800
01:09:01,332 --> 01:09:02,799
No, that couldn't be.

801
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,492
Emily was here upstairs.

802
01:09:04,602 --> 01:09:06,229
Could you call her?

803
01:09:06,337 --> 01:09:07,634
Sure. I...

804
01:09:07,738 --> 01:09:08,932
I can call her, yeah.

805
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,132
I can ask her.

806
01:09:10,241 --> 01:09:11,367
Emily...

807
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:14,744
Emily?

808
01:09:16,847 --> 01:09:19,839
Em?

809
01:09:19,951 --> 01:09:21,885
Honey...

810
01:09:21,986 --> 01:09:24,011
Come on down.
Come on.

811
01:09:27,058 --> 01:09:28,958
Hello, Emily.

812
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:36,293
Emily, you know
Elizabeth Young?

813
01:09:40,338 --> 01:09:44,069
You seen her come by
in the last few hours?

814
01:09:48,512 --> 01:09:51,948
If I stepped away for a minute,

815
01:09:52,049 --> 01:09:55,041
you sure there's nothing
you'd want to tell your daddy?

816
01:09:57,121 --> 01:09:59,214
I'm sure.

817
01:10:02,026 --> 01:10:04,426
Good girl.

818
01:10:04,528 --> 01:10:07,053
You can go on up to your room
and play.

819
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,166
Cute kid.

820
01:10:17,274 --> 01:10:18,366
Thank you.

821
01:10:18,476 --> 01:10:20,671
If you hear anything,
you'll give me a call?

822
01:10:20,778 --> 01:10:22,211
I will, Sheriff.

823
01:10:22,313 --> 01:10:25,077
I will, and you can do the same.

824
01:10:25,182 --> 01:10:27,912
I want to check
around the neighborhood.

825
01:10:28,019 --> 01:10:29,486
You and Emily gonna be here?

826
01:10:29,587 --> 01:10:31,248
We'll be here.

827
01:10:31,355 --> 01:10:34,552
Just making sure.

828
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:38,328
Thanks for the water.

829
01:10:38,429 --> 01:10:40,363
You're welcome.

830
01:10:47,772 --> 01:10:49,364
Emily?

831
01:10:49,473 --> 01:10:51,338
Emily?!

832
01:10:54,445 --> 01:10:56,208
Emily,

833
01:10:56,313 --> 01:10:57,280
where is she?

834
01:10:57,381 --> 01:10:58,473
Where is Elizabeth?

835
01:11:23,841 --> 01:11:25,968
Oh, God.

836
01:11:26,077 --> 01:11:27,339
What did you do?

837
01:11:27,445 --> 01:11:28,673
What did you do?

838
01:11:28,779 --> 01:11:30,371
- I didn't do anything!
- Who did it?

839
01:11:30,481 --> 01:11:32,312
- Who did it, then?
- Charlie.

840
01:11:32,416 --> 01:11:34,350
- Don't say Charlie.
- I'm telling you...

841
01:11:37,154 --> 01:11:38,485
What is going on?

842
01:11:38,589 --> 01:11:39,214
Charlie.

843
01:11:39,323 --> 01:11:40,950
Who is Charlie?
Where is he?

844
01:11:41,058 --> 01:11:43,083
Just, please, help me understand
what's happening here.

845
01:11:43,194 --> 01:11:44,752
I can't. I can't.

846
01:11:44,862 --> 01:11:46,022
Help me!

847
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:48,098
I can't.

848
01:11:51,268 --> 01:11:53,099
Did you have a part in this?

849
01:11:53,204 --> 01:11:55,866
Did you have a part
in this?!

850
01:11:55,973 --> 01:11:58,271
He made me help him.

851
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:00,866
He made me...

852
01:12:02,046 --> 01:12:03,104
He made me.

853
01:12:03,214 --> 01:12:05,079
This is him? Is this Charlie?

854
01:12:05,182 --> 01:12:06,206
I can't tell you.

855
01:12:06,317 --> 01:12:07,284
Who is this?!

856
01:12:07,384 --> 01:12:08,851
Please, I can't.

857
01:12:08,953 --> 01:12:09,920
I'm sorry.

858
01:12:12,723 --> 01:12:14,088
You stay right here.

859
01:12:14,191 --> 01:12:15,852
- Don't move.
- Oh, please don't leave me.

860
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,018
Do not move.
You stay right here.

861
01:12:18,762 --> 01:12:22,220
You can't stop him, Daddy!

862
01:13:19,089 --> 01:13:20,420
Hello?

863
01:13:20,524 --> 01:13:21,786
Emily?

864
01:13:21,892 --> 01:13:23,883
Emily, what's happening?

865
01:13:23,994 --> 01:13:26,121
I don't want to play
with Charlie anymore.

866
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:29,097
Emily, where's your father?

867
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,861
Daddy can't save me now.

868
01:13:30,968 --> 01:13:32,230
Emily?

869
01:13:33,737 --> 01:13:35,170
Emily, sweetie, are you there?

870
01:13:35,272 --> 01:13:37,035
Are you okay?

871
01:13:56,961 --> 01:13:58,895
He just left.

872
01:14:03,067 --> 01:14:04,591
Where is he?

873
01:14:04,702 --> 01:14:06,602
He's hiding!

874
01:14:06,704 --> 01:14:07,966
Where are you?!

875
01:14:08,072 --> 01:14:10,131
Where are you?!

876
01:14:30,628 --> 01:14:32,528
You.

877
01:14:35,332 --> 01:14:37,129
You. What are you doing here?

878
01:14:37,234 --> 01:14:38,462
I heard some noises.
I saw you come out

879
01:14:38,569 --> 01:14:40,400
of the woods with a shovel.
Everything all right?

880
01:14:40,504 --> 01:14:42,267
No.

881
01:14:42,373 --> 01:14:45,001
Emily all right?

882
01:14:45,109 --> 01:14:47,009
You stay away.

883
01:14:47,111 --> 01:14:48,373
I want to see her.

884
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:50,538
You stay away.
I'm gonna call the cops.

885
01:14:50,648 --> 01:14:51,876
I want to see her now.

886
01:14:51,982 --> 01:14:53,006
You sick fuck.

887
01:14:53,117 --> 01:14:54,243
- I want to see her.
- Uh, stay away.

888
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:30,851
Daddy?

889
01:15:30,954 --> 01:15:33,354
Honey... stay upstairs.

890
01:15:33,457 --> 01:15:34,446
Stay upstairs.

891
01:15:34,558 --> 01:15:35,582
Upstairs.

892
01:15:55,012 --> 01:15:56,343
You stay away!

893
01:15:56,447 --> 01:15:58,677
You stay away!

894
01:15:58,782 --> 01:16:00,181
You get out of here!

895
01:16:05,389 --> 01:16:06,413
It's okay, sweetheart.

896
01:16:06,523 --> 01:16:07,717
Charlie's gone.

897
01:16:07,825 --> 01:16:08,951
- He'll come back.
- No.

898
01:16:09,059 --> 01:16:10,151
I know he will.

899
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,285
No, he's gone.
He's gone.

900
01:16:12,396 --> 01:16:15,160
Please don't make me
see Charlie, Daddy.

901
01:16:15,265 --> 01:16:19,065
Please don't make me
see Charlie.

902
01:16:19,169 --> 01:16:20,864
I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you.

903
01:16:20,971 --> 01:16:22,404
I'm so sorry, honey.

904
01:16:22,506 --> 01:16:24,474
Please don't
leave me again.

905
01:16:24,575 --> 01:16:27,305
Please don't leave me again.
Not again.

906
01:16:47,564 --> 01:16:50,829
Please don't make me see Charlie.

907
01:17:36,046 --> 01:17:39,538
Is Charlie here right now?

908
01:17:43,654 --> 01:17:45,087
I think he's sleeping.

909
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:32,635
Come out, come out,

910
01:18:32,736 --> 01:18:33,998
wherever you are.

911
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,310
Can you see now, Daddy?

912
01:19:43,307 --> 01:19:45,298
It's okay.

913
01:19:47,744 --> 01:19:49,735
Daddy's gone now.

914
01:20:01,825 --> 01:20:03,793
Dr. Callaway?

915
01:20:05,896 --> 01:20:08,763
Anybody home?

916
01:20:20,911 --> 01:20:22,071
Hello?

917
01:20:46,203 --> 01:20:48,501
Hello?

918
01:21:01,985 --> 01:21:04,783
Emily? Hey...

919
01:21:04,888 --> 01:21:07,584
where's your dad?

920
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:10,718
Neighbor called.

921
01:21:10,827 --> 01:21:13,057
Said there was a problem.

922
01:21:13,163 --> 01:21:14,255
Everything all right?

923
01:21:17,401 --> 01:21:18,959
What you drawing there?

924
01:21:22,506 --> 01:21:25,168
You. Dying.

925
01:21:31,348 --> 01:21:32,576
Emily?

926
01:21:51,468 --> 01:21:54,369
Marco...

927
01:21:54,471 --> 01:21:56,666
Hello?

928
01:22:11,421 --> 01:22:12,615
Dr. Callaway?

929
01:22:12,723 --> 01:22:14,987
Marco...

930
01:22:55,499 --> 01:22:57,364
Polo.

931
01:24:10,407 --> 01:24:14,571
I can't help but sense
a certain tension between us.

932
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:22,718
What's the matter?
Don't you want to play anymore?

933
01:24:22,819 --> 01:24:24,753
Don't you want to have fun?

934
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:28,189
Hmm?

935
01:24:28,291 --> 01:24:30,851
You want your daddy back?
Is that it?

936
01:24:34,297 --> 01:24:36,492
You like him more than me,
don't you?

937
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,033
No.

938
01:24:38,134 --> 01:24:40,159
Oh, oh, liar.

939
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:42,033
I'm not.

940
01:24:42,138 --> 01:24:44,265
Liar, liar...

941
01:24:44,374 --> 01:24:46,706
You're a big fat liar.

942
01:24:51,748 --> 01:24:54,046
You killed Mommy.

943
01:25:06,062 --> 01:25:08,030
One, one thousand...

944
01:25:08,131 --> 01:25:10,395
Two, one thousand...

945
01:25:12,235 --> 01:25:14,760
Three, one thousand...

946
01:25:14,871 --> 01:25:16,964
Four, one thousand...

947
01:25:17,073 --> 01:25:19,041
Five, one thousand...

948
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,019
Hello?

949
01:26:06,456 --> 01:26:09,084
Hello?

950
01:26:34,084 --> 01:26:37,383
Oh, God, David, you scared me.

951
01:26:40,857 --> 01:26:42,882
David?

952
01:27:21,931 --> 01:27:24,058
That's funny.

953
01:27:25,769 --> 01:27:28,101
I could've sworn
I saw a little girl

954
01:27:28,204 --> 01:27:31,401
by the name of Emily
come in here.

955
01:27:32,442 --> 01:27:34,000
Emily.

956
01:27:35,045 --> 01:27:36,945
I wonder...

957
01:27:37,047 --> 01:27:40,881
where she could be.

958
01:27:40,984 --> 01:27:45,387
Could she be hiding
under the bed?

959
01:27:45,488 --> 01:27:46,955
No...

960
01:27:47,057 --> 01:27:50,720
Could she be hiding
under this bed?

961
01:27:51,928 --> 01:27:53,452
No.

962
01:27:55,965 --> 01:27:58,490
Could she be...

963
01:27:58,601 --> 01:28:02,731
hiding in the closet?

964
01:28:22,525 --> 01:28:24,857
# Papa's gonna buy you #

965
01:28:24,961 --> 01:28:26,861
# A mockingbird #

966
01:28:26,963 --> 01:28:33,926
# And if that mockingbird
don't... sing #

967
01:28:34,037 --> 01:28:38,770
# Papa's going to buy you
a diamond ring #

968
01:28:38,875 --> 01:28:43,039
# And if that diamond ring
turns brass #

969
01:28:43,146 --> 01:28:50,609
# Papa's going to buy you a...
looking glass #

970
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:55,680
# And if that looking glass
gets broke #

971
01:28:55,792 --> 01:29:01,992
# Papa's going to buy you...
a billy goat. #

972
01:29:21,885 --> 01:29:22,977
Emily?

973
01:29:26,589 --> 01:29:28,648
Emily?

974
01:29:40,236 --> 01:29:41,965
Emily, open up for Daddy.

975
01:29:51,447 --> 01:29:52,812
Mommy misses you.

976
01:30:30,653 --> 01:30:32,211
Emily?

977
01:30:53,176 --> 01:30:56,407
Emily!

978
01:31:02,952 --> 01:31:06,189
Emily!

979
01:31:28,511 --> 01:31:34,245
Emily... your daddy's
looking for you.

980
01:31:51,501 --> 01:31:55,130
# Papa's gonna buy you... #

981
01:33:07,643 --> 01:33:08,610
Katherine.

982
01:33:09,946 --> 01:33:11,709
Charlie?

983
01:33:11,814 --> 01:33:14,146
No, it's-it's me. It's David.

984
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:15,512
Where is Emily?

985
01:33:15,618 --> 01:33:16,642
Katherine, I...

986
01:33:16,753 --> 01:33:17,720
- Emily!
- It's all right.

987
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:19,185
I just want to explain
to you what it is...

988
01:33:19,288 --> 01:33:20,880
- Stay right there.
- You were right.

989
01:33:20,990 --> 01:33:22,514
- Emily!
- You were right.

990
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:23,785
I never should've
brought her up here.

991
01:33:23,893 --> 01:33:24,860
It was a mistake.

992
01:33:24,961 --> 01:33:26,952
I mean, Emily's not

993
01:33:27,063 --> 01:33:30,032
the person who's... not well.

994
01:33:30,133 --> 01:33:31,725
It's me.

995
01:33:31,834 --> 01:33:35,565
And you said it...

996
01:33:35,671 --> 01:33:38,697
"Trauma causes pain",
and you were right.

997
01:33:39,942 --> 01:33:42,706
We're going to get you
some help, okay?

998
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:44,847
I'm sorry.

999
01:34:04,834 --> 01:34:06,699
Dad!

1000
01:34:21,617 --> 01:34:24,609
There you are.

1001
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,017
Don't...

1002
01:34:26,122 --> 01:34:28,352
What?

1003
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:31,791
Don't hurt her.

1004
01:34:31,894 --> 01:34:33,953
Why?

1005
01:34:35,164 --> 01:34:37,223
She's my friend.

1006
01:34:42,271 --> 01:34:45,104
I thought I was your friend.

1007
01:34:45,208 --> 01:34:47,972
Please, Charlie.

1008
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:11,964
Hide and seek.

1009
01:35:32,555 --> 01:35:34,182
It's okay. It's okay.

1010
01:35:34,290 --> 01:35:37,191
You're safe now.

1011
01:36:06,148 --> 01:36:08,048
Time for school, sweetheart.

1012
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:09,879
Okay.

1013
01:36:27,002 --> 01:36:28,401
Have you got your homework?

1014
01:36:28,504 --> 01:36:29,493
Yes.

1015
01:36:29,605 --> 01:36:31,402
Did you brush your teeth?

1016
01:36:31,507 --> 01:36:32,667
