Big surprise for the Russians.

460
00:38:42,332 --> 00:38:47,201
There's nothing like them
in the fossil record. I'm sure.

461
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:51,104
Okay, so they predate
the fossil record.

462
00:38:51,174 --> 00:38:55,440
That would make 'em
a couple billion years old.

463
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:59,572
And we've just never seen one
'til now. Right.

464
00:38:59,649 --> 00:39:03,483
I vote for outer space.
No way these are local boys.

[ Chuckles ]

466
00:39:07,924 --> 00:39:12,691
Well, haven't seen a sign
for hours.

467
00:39:12,762 --> 00:39:14,821
Must be long gone.

468
00:39:14,898 --> 00:39:19,665
Yeah, must be. Hey, why don't you
take a little stroll and find out ?

469
00:39:21,571 --> 00:39:25,837
[ Sighs ]
We gotta do something.

470
00:39:36,786 --> 00:39:38,754
"We gotta do something."

471
00:39:38,821 --> 00:39:42,848
I don't know why "we" always
has to be "me" every damn time.

472
00:39:42,926 --> 00:39:46,862
We, we, we. What do I look like ?
An expert on worms ?

00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:49,490
Watch it, Valentine,
it's got a good six-foot reach.

474
00:39:49,565 --> 00:39:51,863
Thank you, Earl.

475
00:39:54,537 --> 00:39:56,630
Son of a bitch !

476
00:39:56,706 --> 00:40:01,473
Son of a goddamn bitch !
Pardon my French.

477
00:40:01,544 --> 00:40:05,605
Shit ! It's been waitin' here all this
time ? How's it know we're still here ?

478
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:10,947
It's got no eyes, right ?
Sure as hell can't smell us underground.

479
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,147
I say it's been listenin'.

480
00:40:13,222 --> 00:40:17,454
Of course !
It senses seismic vibration.

481
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:20,462
It can hear every move we make,
especially on this rock.

482
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,464
It's a perfect conductor !

483
00:40:22,532 --> 00:40:27,333
That means we're stuck.
That pisses me off !

484
00:40:35,478 --> 00:40:39,778
[ Earl ] I hate to be crude,
but I gotta take care of business.

485
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:42,977
- [ Valentine ] Me too.
- [ Rhonda ] Same here.

486
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,781
[ Earl ]
Ahh.

487
00:41:10,146 --> 00:41:11,909
Thanks.

488
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:16,645
Oh. No problem.
Anytime.

489
00:41:28,097 --> 00:41:30,565
Well, what's the plan ?

490
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:35,570
The first thing we gotta do
is see if ol' Stumpy's still out there.

491
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,409
- Can I borrow that shovel ?
- Yeah.

492

[ Roaring ]

493
00:41:48,284 --> 00:41:51,151
Doesn't he have a home
to go to ?

494
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,156
- That's why Edgar never got
down off that damn tower.
- I think I have an idea.

495
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:59,786
We're gonna have to come up
with some sort of plan or
he's gonna wait us to death.

496
00:41:59,862 --> 00:42:03,263
- I was thinking--
- Why don't we make a run for it ?
We outran him yesterday.

497
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:05,300
Run for it ?
Running's not a plan.

498
00:42:05,368 --> 00:42:09,600
Running's what you do when a plan fails.
You're not tryin' to think.

499
00:42:09,672 --> 00:42:12,072
[ Valentine ] It ain't like we got
a hell of a lot of options.

500
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:15,110
There's always options.
We just gotta think of them, that's all.

501
00:42:15,178 --> 00:42:17,339
Well, why don't you
start thinkin' ?

502
00:42:17,413 --> 00:42:19,745
Why in the hell do I always
have to do all the thinking ?

503
00:42:19,816 --> 00:42:24,116
- Who died and made you Einstein ?
- You know how to pole vault ?

504
00:42:26,055 --> 00:42:30,515
We just stay where
he can't get us,

505
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:33,990
on these residual boulders.

506
00:42:34,063 --> 00:42:36,657
My truck's parked
right next to one.

507
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:50,540
Stay on those
residual boulders !

508
00:42:53,116 --> 00:42:57,314
That Tammy Lynn Baxter,
she do much pole vaulting ?

509
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:05,357
Shit !

510
00:43:20,209 --> 00:43:22,370
That's pretty good.

511
00:43:40,396 --> 00:43:44,389
That slimebag ain't gonna give us
much time once we hit that truck.

512
00:43:44,467 --> 00:43:47,493
- I say we all jump together.
- Right.

513
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,538
Wait, wait, wait.

514
00:43:51,674 --> 00:43:53,665
Okay, ready.

Go, go, go, go !

- Uh, can somebody, perhaps, help me ?

[ Valentine ]
No, no !

521
00:44:32,515 --> 00:44:37,248
The snake things are just
their tongues or something.
These animals are huge !

I'm sorry. I'm... having
a real difficult time with this.

- Hey, Walter.

- Where's Burt and Heather ?
- I can't reach 'em.

525
00:44:48,831 --> 00:44:51,800
I guess they're still
driving around somewhere.

526
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:56,327
Rhonda, what's the name you call those
things ? Where do they come from ?

527
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:58,999
- I don't know.
- You're a scientist, aren't you ?

528
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:01,066
Aren't you supposed
to have a theory ?

529
00:45:01,143 --> 00:45:04,670
Look, these creatures
are absolutely unprecedented.

530
00:45:04,747 --> 00:45:08,274
- Yeah. But where do they come from ?
- Yeah !

531
00:45:08,351 --> 00:45:11,787
It doesn't matter
where they come from.

532
00:45:11,854 --> 00:45:14,584
No name. Hmph !

533
00:45:14,657 --> 00:45:17,592
We discovered them.
We should name them !

534
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,959
Walter, forget the damn name !

535
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:24,329
Now me and Earl think we better
get the hell out of this valley.

536
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,834
Hang on, Val.
Let's not go off half-cocked.

537
00:45:26,902 --> 00:45:29,097
Yeah ! Somebody's bound
to come check on us...

538
00:45:29,171 --> 00:45:32,504
once they see the road is out
and the lines are down.

539
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:34,304
Yeah, that's how it works.

[ Flies Buzzing ]

541
00:45:55,031 --> 00:45:58,262
- Or "suckoids."
- "Oids." Oids.

00:45:58,334 --> 00:46:00,325
I like "snakeoids."

543
00:46:00,403 --> 00:46:04,464
One of 'em comes near me, and I'll just
hit him with a five-pound pickax.

544
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,805
You don't understand, Nestor.
They come up from underneath
the ground and grab you.

545
00:46:07,877 --> 00:46:10,505
They sense the slightest vibration
through the ground.

546
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:13,173
Even footsteps.
That's how they hunt.

547
00:46:13,249 --> 00:46:17,583
Hey, so like
we don't vibrate, right ?

548
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:20,087
Maybe they won't even
come through here.

549
00:46:20,156 --> 00:46:22,420
Maybe they'll leave us alone !

That's what I'll use.

Now, look !

00:46:32,635 --> 00:46:35,399
You see,
they're headed right for us.

553
00:46:35,471 --> 00:46:38,907
Look, they trapped Edgar here.
Grabbed Old Fred right here.

554
00:46:38,974 --> 00:46:43,206
Nailed those two
poor suckers on the road,
and the doctor's place is here !

555
00:46:43,279 --> 00:46:46,578
This valley is just
one long smorgasbord.

556
00:46:46,649 --> 00:46:49,675
We have got to get out.

557
00:46:52,922 --> 00:46:57,450
- I'm gonna go get Mindy.
- She's okay. I saw her
playing down the street.

558
00:46:57,526 --> 00:47:01,394
That's what I like... "graboids" !
That's it, graboids !

559
00:47:01,464 --> 00:47:03,398
Jesus, Walter.

560
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:06,435
We're gonna be sorry
if we don't give it a name.

561
00:47:06,502 --> 00:47:11,064
Okay, Val, you say let's get outta here.
Where are we supposed to go ?

562
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,576
Well, Rhonda's got an idea
about that.

563
00:47:14,643 --> 00:47:17,874
Yeah. See, they move very easily
through the Pleistocene alluvials.

564
00:47:21,384 --> 00:47:24,785
The dirt. The loose soil
that covers the valley floor.

565
00:47:24,854 --> 00:47:26,788
But they can't move
through rock.

566
00:47:26,856 --> 00:47:30,417
- So we should
head west to the mountains.
- Up the old Jeep trail.

567
00:47:30,493 --> 00:47:32,859
If those mountains are solid granite,
we'd be safe there.

568
00:47:32,928 --> 00:47:35,897
- And we could hike
along them to Bixby if we--

So now what ?

Could we make it to the mountains,
use Burt's explosives ?

No way.
We'd need 50 of those bombs.
