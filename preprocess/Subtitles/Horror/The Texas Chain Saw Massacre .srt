1
00:02:40,902 --> 00:02:42,802
...this inditement is only one of
a series to be handed down...

2
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:47,438
as result of the respectful
rangery investigation.

3
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:51,441
Ray Robbin, in Texas, is this
hour top news story...

4
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:54,840
and informant led officers at
Marto County sheriff...

5
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:57,652
department, to a cemetery, just
outside the small rude Texas...

6
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,750
community of Newt, early this
morning. Officers there...

7
00:03:00,124 --> 00:03:03,184
discovered what appeared to be
a grizzly work of art...

8
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:06,460
The remains of a badly
decomposed body, wired to a...

9
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,231
large monument. A second body
was found in the ditch near...

10
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:12,297
the perimeter of the cemetery,
subsequent investigation has...

11
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,400
revealed at least a dozen empty
crypts, and it's clear more...

12
00:03:15,774 --> 00:03:18,038
will turn up as the probe
continues deputies report...

13
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:20,741
that in some instances, only
parts of the corpses have been...

14
00:03:21,112 --> 00:03:22,272
removed. The head,
or in some cases...

15
00:03:22,714 --> 00:03:24,706
the extremities removed, and...

16
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,484
the remainder of the corpse left
intact. Evidence indicates the...

17
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:31,619
robberies have occurred over a
period of time.

18
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:34,015
Sheriff Rhesus Maldonado
refuses to give details...

19
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:37,124
in this case and said only...

20
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:39,625
that he did have a strong
evidence linking the crime to...

21
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:43,094
elements outside the state. Area
residents have reportedly...

22
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,302
converged on the cemetery
claiming the remains of relatives

23
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:46,296
have been removed.

24
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,940
No suspects are in custody, as
investigation at the scene...

25
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:54,042
continues.

26
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:22,775
...mental hospital and released.
A 16-story-building downtown...

27
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:25,773
Atlanta, collapsed today, killing
at least 29 persons.

28
00:05:26,148 --> 00:05:29,276
The engineering firm responsible
could offer no explanation for...

29
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:31,552
the collapse although the
construction firm say there's...

30
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:34,151
no logical reason for the
collapse is suspected sabotage.

31
00:05:34,556 --> 00:05:37,492
Police in Gary, Indiana, have
been unable to identify the...

32
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:41,621
bodies of a young man...

33
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:43,795
and four children
who had...

34
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:45,759
their features carved away,
the man's dimples had been...

35
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,109
removed. Police first identified
the victims as 2 women...

36
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:56,875
continuing the program of the
government to overwhelm reaches...

37
00:05:57,581 --> 00:06:00,244
beyond the Amazon today are
ruptured into violence...

38
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:03,087
forces of at least three South
America governments already...

39
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:08,050
have been involved.

40
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:12,387
...this territory it tells it's
sketchy and yet none of...

41
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:16,192
the governments is involved
as its knowledge to a war.

42
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:20,597
...Police in Dallas arrested a
young couple today...

43
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:24,571
complaints by neighbors led
them to discover a 18-month-old

44
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:28,276
daughter the couple...

45
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:32,914
chained in the attic of a
dilapidated house...

46
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:44,228
Franklin!

47
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:57,136
Are you ok?

48
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:06,779
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take...

49
00:07:07,157 --> 00:07:10,490
- much more of this.
- The condition of retro gradation...

50
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:13,728
is contrary or inharmonious to the
regular direction of actual...

51
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:16,759
movement in the zodiac, and is,
in that respect, evil.

52
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:20,331
Hint: When malefic planets are in
retrograde, and Saturn is malefic...

53
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:23,641
their maleficies are increased.

54
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,844
Have you been doing that Reader's
Digest worth our...

55
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,180
Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad
influence. It's just particularly...

56
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,846
bad influence now, because
it's in retrograde.

57
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:36,349
Hey, man, do you believe all that
stuff your old lady is talking me?

58
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,241
My granddaddy is buried here. Can
we find out if anything happened?

59
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:00,513
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- See that big heavy fella...

60
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,249
standing with that big flashlight,
isn't that the sheriff?

61
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:07,519
You go tell him your granddaddy is
buried in there. He'll let you in.

62
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:10,414
Ok. Thank you.

63
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:11,886
Hey, fella, I'm gonna
run off to...

64
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:13,920
- meet him if you don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.

65
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:17,689
- Hey, folks. Let us go see where...

66
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:20,261
her granddaddy's buried.

67
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:27,835
Things happen here about
they don't tell about.

68
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,210
I see things.

69
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:39,919
You see, they say it's just an old
man talking.

70
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:44,361
You laugh at an old man...

71
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,030
this thing that laughs
knows better.

72
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:00,544
Yes, they're sure. The man said the
Tallman's grave had been dug up.

73
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:04,108
Mama, don't worry.
I saw it myself!

74
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:06,110
It didn't look dug up to me.

75
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:12,854
What's that? What smell?

76
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:18,694
What is that stench?

77
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:27,542
Hey. That's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used...

78
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,338
to sell his cattle! We got an uncle
that works in one of those places...

79
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:36,515
outside of Fortworth. See those
buildings there? That's where...

80
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:40,046
they kill him. They bash'em in the
head with a big sledgehammer!

81
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:42,957
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill him.

82
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:01,077
It'd start squealing and freaking
out, they'd have to...

83
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:03,276
come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.

84
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:07,650
They'd scatter them before
they were even dead.

85
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:10,451
That's horrible! People shouldn't
kill animals for food.

86
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,817
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they get this big air gun...

87
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:17,458
that shoots a bullet into the skull
and then retracts it.

88
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:23,668
Franklin, I like me, please
change the subject.

89
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:25,729
That smell's still going on.

90
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,870
Oh, man! It's hot in here.

91
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:40,051
- Hitchhiker!
- Should we take him up?

92
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:42,514
Yeah man, pick him up.
He'll asphyxiate out there!

93
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:44,355
- What does he look like?
- The son of a bitch 's gonna...

94
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,593
- smell like the slaughterhouse.
- Give the guy a break. He can...

95
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:49,487
- sit by Franklin.
- What do you wanna do?

96
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,296
- He's weird looking, no.

97
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:16,716
- I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where're you heading, man?

98
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:21,923
- You work at that place?
- Don't.

99
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,028
- How did you get stuck out here?

100
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,100
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- I got an uncle that works...

101
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:30,441
- at a slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.

102
00:11:31,143 --> 00:11:32,576
My grandfather, too.

103
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:36,505
My family's always been in beef.

104
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:39,013
The whole family are cracked.
Hey man, did you go into that...

105
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:44,087
slaughter room or whatever
they call it?

106
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,390
Where they shoot the cattle
with that air gun thing?

107
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:50,092
- That gun is no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.

108
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:53,523
With the sledge!
That was better.

109
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:57,129
- They died better that way.
- How come? I thought the gun...

110
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:59,199
- was better.
- Oh no. With the new way...

111
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:04,839
- people were put out of jobs.

112
00:12:05,313 --> 00:12:07,008
- You do that?
- Look!

113
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:17,288
- I was the killer!
- Let me see them.

114
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:20,987
- They don't seem to head your way.
- You took these, huh?

115
00:12:21,397 --> 00:12:23,332
- Yeah!
- Franklin.

116
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,760
- Let me see.
- They make hitches...

117
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:36,603
They take the head and they boil,
except for the tongue, and scrape...

118
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,241
all the flesh away from the bone.

119
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:43,677
They use everything,
they throw nothing away.

120
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:49,183
They use jaws, muscles, and
the eyes, and the ligaments...

121
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,722
- and everything!
- Look at this.

122
00:12:52,164 --> 00:12:56,601
- They boil the nose and the gums
down to a big jelly of fat.

123
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:58,833
I don't know it was in that stuff.

124
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:01,936
It's really good. Do you like it?

125
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:07,612
- Yeah, I like it. It's good!
- It sounds horrible. Can't we...

126
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:10,313
- talk about something else?
- You'd probably like it if you...

127
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:12,379
didn't know what was in it.

128
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,447
I wouldn't and I wish you'd
stop talking about it.

129
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:18,484
Take it before everybody's sick.

130
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:37,378
What are you doing?

131
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:42,047
Look. I think that might hurt.

132
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:52,122
Oh, come on!

133
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:55,865
What are you doing to yourself?

134
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:59,899
Oh, what are you doing?

135
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:10,005
Nice, man!

136
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:33,738
I have this knife.

137
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:36,941
Put that away, too.

138
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:42,973
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man. Put it back.

139
00:15:25,797 --> 00:15:27,264
You took my picture!

140
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:32,761
You can take me to my house.
I live right off this road.

141
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:36,832
I don't know, man.
We're in much of a hurry.

142
00:15:38,711 --> 00:15:41,111
- How close is it?
- It's real close.

143
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:45,779
Couldn't you just walk? I mean...
If it's so close.

144
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:49,952
You could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese. My brother...

145
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:52,890
- makes it real good. You'll like it.
- I think we'd better push on, man.

146
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:58,196
Don't we, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry...

147
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:25,485
- It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.

148
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:27,891
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?

149
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:30,596
- 2 dollars. It's a good picture.
- No, man. Franklin...

150
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:33,696
give him back that picture.

151
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:09,364
I'm about to freak. Call a cop.

152
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:12,339
That's the last damn hitchhiker
I ever take.

153
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:21,642
- Listen to Franklin's horoscope:
- I'm sorry.

154
00:18:25,091 --> 00:18:26,922
Travel in the countryside.

155
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,727
Long range plans,
upsetting persons...

156
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:34,530
around you, could make this a
disturbing and unpredictable day.

157
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:39,305
The events in the world are not
doing much, to cheer one up.

158
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:41,672
- That's just perfect!
- Franklin, I think you'll be alright.

159
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:46,004
Hey, Kat, read Alex's. He's
Capricorn.

160
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:56,155
Oh, no.

161
00:18:56,591 --> 00:19:01,393
Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.
There are moments where we...

162
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:03,891
cannot believe that what's
happening is really true...

163
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,492
pinch yourself and you may
find out that it is.

164
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:41,000
Hurry up.

165
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,044
Here comes somebody.

166
00:19:57,691 --> 00:19:58,817
How are you?

167
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:02,522
Would you fill her up, please?

168
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:06,090
I got no gas.

169
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:10,102
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty. Transport won't...

170
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:13,073
be here until this afternoon.

171
00:20:13,876 --> 00:20:16,037
Maybe not even until
tomorrow morning.

172
00:20:16,778 --> 00:20:19,838
Hey, you know where "The Old
Franklin Place" is?

173
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:28,582
- "The Old Franklin Place"?
- It's an old 2-story house and...

174
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:31,825
it's sitting up on the hill. I think
you have to turn on the road...

175
00:20:32,228 --> 00:20:34,025
back there,
but I'm not real sure.

176
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:38,598
Maybe I've seen something like
that up there. But look, you boys...

177
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:44,932
don't wanna go messing around
an old house.

178
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:48,168
Those things are dangerous,
you're bound to get hurt!

179
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,280
- We'll be careful.
- Don't wanna go fooling around...

180
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,381
other folk's property. Some folks
don't like it.

181
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,277
They don't mind
showing you.

182
00:20:57,722 --> 00:21:00,317
- My father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?

183
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,555
- Yeah.
- Look...

184
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:07,360
I got barbecue here. Why don't
you stay a while?

185
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,494
The transport will be by
in a little while...

186
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,308
I can go and get some barbecue.

187
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:20,112
Them girls, they don't wanna go
messing around an old house.

188
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:22,777
Best you stick around here.

189
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:37,429
We should've asked him if there's
another gas station around here.

190
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:39,901
Don't you think he would have told
us if there was?

191
00:21:41,236 --> 00:21:45,229
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I'll go ask.

192
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,612
What the hell, we should have
stopped back there for gas.

193
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,876
Go, damn it.
There.

194
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,548
You think this place has
room service?

195
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:02,692
Franklin, you're cutting the van!

196
00:22:05,396 --> 00:22:08,263
Yeah, I just started doing that.

197
00:22:12,738 --> 00:22:18,074
I bet this is some of that guy's
blood. Look at that.

198
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,435
- Think it's his blood?
- I guess so.

199
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:27,812
That's blood, alright. And I got
cut the hell out of him, chef.

200
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:31,690
You think you could do that
to yourself?

201
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:35,053
Crazy?

202
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:40,900
It takes something, though, I mean,
do that to yourself, like he did.

203
00:22:44,938 --> 00:22:47,066
You think I said something that
made him mad?

204
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:53,003
- What?
- Franklin, you're crazy as he was.

205
00:22:56,618 --> 00:23:00,419
Hey, I got us some barbecue.
Newt's the closest place to get gas.

206
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:11,428
We're going to that Granpa's place.
There's a creek, you can go swimming.

207
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:14,961
Come on, Sally, we're going to
that Granpa's place!

208
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:18,905
- Let's go.
- Hey, that guy smeared blood...

209
00:23:19,276 --> 00:23:23,714
- all over the van.
- Let's not waste time to wipe this up.

210
00:23:24,682 --> 00:23:27,378
What? What did you do?
You're in someone's van?

211
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:50,708
Let me see your knife.

212
00:23:55,415 --> 00:23:56,541
Thank you.

213
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:05,391
Franklin, if we run out of gas
before we get back to that service...

214
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:07,956
station, you're towing us back
in that chair.

215
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,901
Hey...

216
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:22,668
You think that guy was just trying
to scare us by blowing out...

217
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,944
my picture like that?

218
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:14,157
Oh, look, they let the place
fall apart.

219
00:25:17,904 --> 00:25:19,531
Put it over there.

220
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:22,264
- Wanna go over there?
- Let's go.

221
00:25:28,482 --> 00:25:29,972
Oh, Kirk, come on!

222
00:25:30,418 --> 00:25:31,942
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

223
00:25:36,325 --> 00:25:38,885
I want to see the smear
the guy made.

224
00:25:46,735 --> 00:25:50,001
This is weird.
I wonder if that means something.

225
00:25:50,473 --> 00:25:52,498
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's gonna get you.

226
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:56,072
- Why don't you wash it off, ok?
- I want to see inside.

227
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,176
- Jerry!
- Ok!

228
00:26:01,452 --> 00:26:03,044
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

229
00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:08,550
- Get it. You wash it up.
- You don't think that guy...

230
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:11,394
- is trying to follow us, do you?
- What for?

231
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:26,906
Where's my knife?
Kirk?

232
00:26:29,382 --> 00:26:31,213
Looks like it must have been
a nursery room.

233
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:35,185
This was my room. I got to stay
here until I was 8 years old.

234
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:37,987
- Until my grandmother died.
- What happened?

235
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,755
- To my grandmother?
- Yeah, she died.

236
00:27:16,099 --> 00:27:18,966
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- I think it's seen better days...

237
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:22,160
These animals would to put me to
sleep when I was a little girl.

238
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:25,532
Look at the zebra. I had this
fascination for the zebras...

239
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:28,036
Kate?

240
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:56,465
Sally!

241
00:29:05,451 --> 00:29:07,817
Come on, Franklin!
It's gonna be a fun trip.

242
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:20,730
If I have any more fun today,
I don't think I'll take it!

243
00:29:40,622 --> 00:29:43,090
- Hey, Franklin!
- What's wrong?

244
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:47,023
Didn't you say there was a
swimming well out here?

245
00:29:49,732 --> 00:29:51,893
Pam and I would like to go
swimming in there.

246
00:29:55,338 --> 00:29:58,000
There used to be a trail down
between those two old sheds.

247
00:29:59,743 --> 00:30:00,903
Come on.

248
00:30:03,947 --> 00:30:07,974
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- We'll see them in an hour or so.

249
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:13,947
Yeah. See them down in
about an hour or so.

250
00:30:34,213 --> 00:30:38,514
Sally!
Sally...

251
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:58,099
Seed growing in the world...

252
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:01,699
I don't want to miss it.

253
00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:07,479
Man, a scorpion,
there's a scorpion!

254
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,255
Crap!

255
00:31:25,603 --> 00:31:26,900
This must be it!

256
00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:29,168
Are you ok?

257
00:31:31,275 --> 00:31:33,709
What the hell, Franklin would never
get down here anyway.

258
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:36,509
I bet he must have when
he was little.

259
00:31:37,315 --> 00:31:39,476
Franklin never was little.

260
00:31:49,095 --> 00:31:50,858
Gasoline.

261
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:54,766
I can leave my guitar, you know,
I'd give him a couple of bucks...

262
00:31:55,267 --> 00:31:58,236
We gotta come back by here anyway,
I can pick up my guitar and...

263
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:00,470
give him a couple more dollars
and we get more gas...

264
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:03,536
He won't want your guitar,
he's not gonna sell us some gas...

265
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,275
let's just go back now.

266
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:51,086
Hey, come here!
Come here, look at this.

267
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:18,788
- A generator!
- What?

268
00:33:20,193 --> 00:33:22,661
A generator! For electricity!

269
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:28,190
Hey, hello! Is there anybody
in the house?

270
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,909
Hello! Is anybody home?

271
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,607
I got something for you.

272
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:47,146
Let's go!

273
00:34:51,692 --> 00:34:52,716
Hello?

274
00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:56,128
Hello?

275
00:35:06,374 --> 00:35:08,774
- Come look at this!
- Let's go!

276
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:13,571
Hello!

277
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:18,979
Anybody home?

278
00:35:21,123 --> 00:35:21,987
Hello?

279
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,801
Hey, Pam!

280
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,806
Hello!

281
00:36:07,607 --> 00:36:08,665
Kirk!

282
00:36:22,924 --> 00:36:24,222
Kirk!

283
00:36:33,035 --> 00:36:33,865
Kirk!

284
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:44,377
Kirk?

285
00:37:08,907 --> 00:37:09,771
Kirk!

286
00:37:13,946 --> 00:37:14,640
Kirk?

287
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:24,752
Kirk?

288
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,907
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you!

289
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:55,979
You don't think it means anything?

290
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,048
We'll protect you if
he tries to get you.

291
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:01,720
- Maybe it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.

292
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:07,759
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- You worry too much.

293
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,260
He couldn't find us, anyway.
He doesn't even know our names.

294
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:16,274
I gave him your name, Franklin.
And I told him where you lived.

295
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:19,042
I even gave him your ZIP code.
He's gonna kill you.

296
00:41:19,545 --> 00:41:20,512
Jerry...

297
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:24,676
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.

298
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:27,711
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife, remember?

299
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:29,720
When did you have it last?

300
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:35,351
I didn't have it last.
You had it last.

301
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:38,128
I gave it to you, remember?
What did you do with it?

302
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,962
I don't know. Didn't I
give it back to you?

303
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:43,265
No, I didn't have it when I got
out of the van.

304
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:46,501
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right. I'll look for it.

305
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,170
Listen, I think I'll walk down to
the creek before it gets too dark.

306
00:41:51,546 --> 00:41:52,604
How do I get there, Frank?

307
00:41:53,348 --> 00:41:55,976
Well, there's a trail down there.
Between the two old sheds.

308
00:41:57,586 --> 00:42:00,112
- Can I go too?
- I think you'd better stay here.

309
00:42:02,025 --> 00:42:03,390
All right.

310
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:13,498
I can't find it.

311
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:25,278
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

312
00:42:29,187 --> 00:42:31,155
You really are mad, huh?

313
00:42:32,924 --> 00:42:35,450
I don't blame you.

314
00:42:36,662 --> 00:42:38,027
Kirk!

315
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:51,400
You really didn't want me
to come, did you?

316
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:57,348
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.

317
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:06,089
Did you believe all that stuff
Pam was telling about?

318
00:43:06,494 --> 00:43:08,962
Saturn, and retrograde,
and all that?

319
00:43:09,764 --> 00:43:13,531
I don't know. Everything means
something, I guess.

320
00:43:19,508 --> 00:43:21,772
You don't think that guy is
trying to follow us, do you?

321
00:43:22,778 --> 00:43:24,872
I mean, there's no way
that he could follow us.

322
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:31,554
He'd probably find
Kirk and kill him.

323
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:41,656
- Sally...
- What now?

324
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:47,270
Nothing.

325
00:43:50,108 --> 00:43:52,008
Nevermind.

326
00:43:57,382 --> 00:43:58,610
Kirk!

327
00:44:28,983 --> 00:44:30,541
Hello?

328
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:35,880
Is anybody home?

329
00:44:40,529 --> 00:44:43,828
Excuse me, I'm looking for
some friends. Hello?

330
00:44:49,806 --> 00:44:51,569
Is anybody here?

331
00:44:55,078 --> 00:44:56,045
Damn.

332
00:45:13,332 --> 00:45:16,824
Kirk!
Are you guys in there?

333
00:45:21,607 --> 00:45:24,600
Hey, guys! Quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.

334
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,712
Pam, is that you?

335
00:45:39,527 --> 00:45:41,222
Okay, you guys!

336
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:48,260
Come on out.
Come on!

337
00:45:59,582 --> 00:46:01,277
Kirk?

338
00:48:00,346 --> 00:48:04,043
They must be lost. They don't
have a flashlight or anything.

339
00:48:04,517 --> 00:48:06,985
If they 're not back in a minute,
we'd better go look for them

340
00:48:07,987 --> 00:48:10,012
What if we get lost, too?

341
00:48:11,758 --> 00:48:14,886
Sally, we ought to go to that
gas station and get help.

342
00:48:15,362 --> 00:48:17,421
I'm not leaving here
without Jerry.

343
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:21,094
Jerry!

344
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:27,230
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

345
00:48:29,143 --> 00:48:32,510
Jerry!

346
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:34,672
Jerry!

347
00:48:36,385 --> 00:48:37,317
Hey!

348
00:48:42,257 --> 00:48:44,452
They'll probably be back
in a minute or so.

349
00:48:46,729 --> 00:48:49,392
Sally, we ought to go
to that gas station.

350
00:48:52,602 --> 00:48:53,967
Sally...

351
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:57,331
I think we ought to go.

352
00:49:01,378 --> 00:49:03,312
Are the keys in the van?

353
00:49:05,816 --> 00:49:08,080
Could I see the flashlight
for a minute?

354
00:49:08,486 --> 00:49:09,953
What for?

355
00:49:10,521 --> 00:49:12,922
Let me see the flashlight.
I'm gonna go look for them.

356
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:14,155
You don't have to go.

357
00:49:14,693 --> 00:49:16,593
Sally, no, I don't think that's
a good idea, Sally.

358
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,462
I don't think you ought to go.

359
00:49:19,731 --> 00:49:21,961
Look, I'm gonna honk
the horn one more time.

360
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,428
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No, I'm gonna honk the horn...

361
00:49:26,973 --> 00:49:30,500
and we will wait a minute, and
they will come and we will go.

362
00:49:31,477 --> 00:49:32,501
All right?

363
00:49:38,852 --> 00:49:42,549
Sally, they took the keys!
We don't have any keys!

364
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:44,081
They took the keys!

365
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,786
Stop it!
Stop it!

366
00:49:49,864 --> 00:49:53,857
- Now give me the flashlight!
- No, Sally! You can't go!

367
00:49:54,903 --> 00:49:56,962
What if they came back
and we weren't here?

368
00:49:57,405 --> 00:50:00,432
- Franklin, give me that flashlight!
- I'll keep the flashlight!

369
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:03,709
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right! All right!

370
00:50:04,046 --> 00:50:05,604
I'll go with you. I'll go
with you, all right?

371
00:50:06,482 --> 00:50:09,645
I'll go with you, but I'll
keep the flashlight.

372
00:50:10,085 --> 00:50:12,520
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.

373
00:50:13,089 --> 00:50:15,455
I can't push you down the hill!

374
00:50:15,892 --> 00:50:16,984
Sally...

375
00:50:19,663 --> 00:50:23,225
- Look, I'll go with you...
- Never mind, I'll go without it.

376
00:50:25,403 --> 00:50:29,339
All right. Sally, wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.

377
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:33,107
Sally! Hold on a minute now.

378
00:50:34,145 --> 00:50:35,807
All right, let's go.

379
00:50:36,281 --> 00:50:37,976
Let's go, I'll go with you.

380
00:50:39,785 --> 00:50:41,753
Sally, I can't keep up with you!

381
00:50:42,221 --> 00:50:43,313
Sally!

382
00:50:44,156 --> 00:50:45,851
Sally, wait a minute!

383
00:50:52,866 --> 00:50:53,798
Hold on!

384
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:06,646
Jerry!

385
00:51:07,014 --> 00:51:07,912
Jerry!

386
00:51:15,857 --> 00:51:21,022
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

387
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:25,364
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

388
00:51:33,442 --> 00:51:35,000
I thought I heard something.

389
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,047
There's a light!

390
00:51:38,415 --> 00:51:39,746
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

391
00:51:42,886 --> 00:51:45,912
- It looks like a house.
- Come on, push!

392
00:51:56,234 --> 00:51:59,602
- It's a house!
- I can't see it very well.

393
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:05,274
- Franklin, this is impossible.
- Come on, Sally!

394
00:52:06,912 --> 00:52:08,675
Get back and push, damn!

395
00:52:10,015 --> 00:52:11,745
Impossible!

396
00:52:14,654 --> 00:52:19,148
I heard something over there!

397
00:52:23,264 --> 00:52:26,529
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!

398
00:52:35,177 --> 00:52:37,372
Sally, I hear something.
Stop! Stop!

399
00:54:43,882 --> 00:54:45,474
Help!

400
00:54:54,393 --> 00:54:56,987
Help me!

401
00:55:22,357 --> 00:55:24,485
Help!

402
00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:37,669
Help me, please!

403
00:58:29,126 --> 00:58:33,358
- Help! Help!
- Whoa! Whoa!

404
00:58:33,997 --> 00:58:37,832
- Help me! Help me!
- Come over here!

405
00:58:41,306 --> 00:58:43,536
You're all right, girl.
Okay?

406
00:58:44,442 --> 00:58:46,137
Hold on, take it easy, all right?

407
00:58:47,179 --> 00:58:50,376
He killed...

408
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:53,985
- Take it easy...
- He killed Franklin...

409
00:58:54,887 --> 00:58:56,184
Call the police!

410
00:58:57,723 --> 00:58:58,985
Jerry!

411
00:59:00,327 --> 00:59:02,625
I don't know what happened
to the others...

412
00:59:03,029 --> 00:59:04,690
There's nobody out there now!

413
00:59:05,532 --> 00:59:08,023
Take it easy!
Take it easy!

414
00:59:09,236 --> 00:59:10,396
What happened?

415
00:59:11,239 --> 00:59:15,767
- Call the police...
- There's no phone here.

416
00:59:17,645 --> 00:59:21,911
We have to drive to the sheriff's.

417
00:59:23,619 --> 00:59:25,587
Take it easy. Take it easy.

418
00:59:26,221 --> 00:59:27,813
I'll get the truck.

419
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:32,420
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Don't go! Don't go!

420
00:59:40,837 --> 00:59:43,237
The weather is expected to
continue warm and clear...

421
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,202
and partially cloudy tomorrow...

422
00:59:47,611 --> 00:59:51,638
with no chance of precipitation.
Expected high of 90 °F.

423
00:59:51,982 --> 00:59:55,213
Our current temperature is 96°.
Winds blow southeast at 3 ml/h.

424
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:58,247
Community 98, kilometer 29.9.

425
00:59:58,856 --> 01:00:01,291
Acting on a typical day
with some news...

426
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:04,220
the word is that the sheriff's
office began an investigation...

427
01:00:04,629 --> 01:00:06,859
early this morning in the
County Cemetery.

428
01:00:07,365 --> 01:00:10,698
Opening crypts and muslins
where there was evidence of...

429
01:00:11,404 --> 01:00:14,635
tampering, The Sheriff found
a reported dozen coffins were...

430
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:17,509
robbed a part of its contents.
According to the sheriff, Rhesus...

431
01:00:17,944 --> 01:00:20,538
Maldonado, there are ones
from which only the head and...

432
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,281
extremities are removed,
and others

433
01:00:23,817 --> 01:00:25,808
and others from which only a
hand or foot removed, with the...

434
01:00:26,286 --> 01:00:32,054
remainder of the cadaver left
intact. Maldonado linked...

435
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,255
What are you doing?

436
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:02,453
- You will come with me...
- No!

437
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:12,826
- What do you want?
- There's no need to do that...

438
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:15,700
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

439
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:25,506
I had to lock up and
get the lights off.

440
01:03:26,048 --> 01:03:28,846
Because electricity is enough to
drive a man out of business.

441
01:03:59,317 --> 01:04:02,912
I hope you're not too
uncomfortable down there.

442
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:10,219
You got nothing to worry about.
Just take it easy.

443
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:13,926
We're gonna get there soon.

444
01:04:16,669 --> 01:04:19,399
No, no, no.

445
01:04:20,573 --> 01:04:22,734
There's no need to do that.

446
01:04:50,973 --> 01:04:54,704
We always do our best.

447
01:04:55,177 --> 01:04:56,337
Hang on.

448
01:05:00,049 --> 01:05:01,038
No.

449
01:05:05,789 --> 01:05:07,757
Half witch.

450
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:14,457
You little shit!

451
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:25,203
You knock-head idiot!

452
01:05:25,944 --> 01:05:29,004
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.

453
01:05:29,481 --> 01:05:31,711
You damn fool!
You almost got caught.

454
01:05:33,051 --> 01:05:35,850
No! They didn't see me.
They don't know nothing!

455
01:05:36,389 --> 01:05:39,153
I told you to stay away
from that graveyard.

456
01:06:19,201 --> 01:06:20,190
I told you...

457
01:06:20,836 --> 01:06:25,365
I told you never to leave
your brother alone!

458
01:06:26,243 --> 01:06:29,838
Get that girl out of the car!
Get her out!

459
01:06:35,018 --> 01:06:37,817
I hope your brother didn't let any
of those kids get away.

460
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:49,264
Look at what your brother did
to that door!

461
01:06:59,612 --> 01:07:02,775
You let her go!

462
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,380
You goddamn idiot!

463
01:07:29,878 --> 01:07:32,472
I thought you were in a hurry.

464
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,044
Where are the kids?
Where are the children?

465
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,684
Did they get away?

466
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:49,158
Are you sure?

467
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:55,570
You...

468
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:00,306
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!

469
01:08:10,388 --> 01:08:13,586
Hey, come here! Look!
See how nice she looks!

470
01:08:14,193 --> 01:08:16,593
Get upstairs and get
your grandpa!

471
01:08:34,347 --> 01:08:37,078
Take it easy there, huh?

472
01:08:38,052 --> 01:08:40,885
You'll stay here for
a few minutes.

473
01:08:43,691 --> 01:08:45,921
Get back in there!

474
01:08:49,297 --> 01:08:51,492
To the chamber!

475
01:08:56,938 --> 01:08:58,803
You just take it easy.

476
01:09:01,911 --> 01:09:04,243
We'll have something
to eat right away.

477
01:09:33,078 --> 01:09:34,909
Hey, you two!

478
01:09:35,448 --> 01:09:37,245
Give me a hand
with grandpa!

479
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:34,767
Look, grandpa! Look!

480
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:50,622
Knock it off!

481
01:12:51,326 --> 01:12:55,888
Quiet! You act like a pack
of hounds.

482
01:12:56,298 --> 01:13:00,326
- We're just having fun!
- You think this is a party?

483
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:06,606
Please!
You can make them stop!

484
01:13:07,043 --> 01:13:10,672
- No shit?
- Shut your mouth!

485
01:13:12,015 --> 01:13:14,984
Can't be helped, young lady.

486
01:13:15,419 --> 01:13:19,014
Please! You can't let them
kill me!

487
01:13:26,531 --> 01:13:28,362
He likes this face.

488
01:13:42,614 --> 01:13:47,552
He's crazy!
You gotta make him stop!

489
01:13:48,021 --> 01:13:49,352
Please...

490
01:13:50,056 --> 01:13:54,891
- He's just a cook!
- Shut up, you bitch hog!

491
01:13:56,996 --> 01:13:59,488
He always does all the work.

492
01:14:00,034 --> 01:14:02,628
He don't like it. Is that right?
You're just a cook!

493
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:04,403
Shut your mouth!

494
01:14:06,474 --> 01:14:08,669
You don't understand nothing.

495
01:14:09,343 --> 01:14:13,178
I understand you ain't nothing!
We do all the work!

496
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:16,240
I just can take no
pleasure in killing.

497
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:24,692
It's just something we gotta do.
It don't mean you have to like it.

498
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:26,183
Please...

499
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,024
Please...

500
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:37,700
I'll do anything you want.

501
01:15:41,643 --> 01:15:43,804
You don't need to torture the girl.

502
01:15:44,379 --> 01:15:46,506
Please, shut up. Remember
you're just a cook.

503
01:15:46,949 --> 01:15:48,212
Let me and him handle this.

504
01:15:50,286 --> 01:15:52,151
I won't have this.

505
01:15:55,058 --> 01:15:59,085
You ain't in no hurry.
And you ain't going no place.

506
01:16:00,564 --> 01:16:03,624
You don't hear me?
I heard you told me much.

507
01:16:07,304 --> 01:16:10,967
No sense in waiting.
I gotta go to my room.

508
01:16:12,978 --> 01:16:16,345
I'll take her to grandpa.

509
01:16:16,815 --> 01:16:18,146
Grandpa'll have some fun.

510
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,115
You always said he was the best.

511
01:16:20,585 --> 01:16:22,280
He's the best all right.

512
01:16:23,188 --> 01:16:27,182
Let's let him half leg.
Grandpa, we're gonna let you...

513
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,925
have this one!

514
01:16:38,305 --> 01:16:39,863
Have this one!

515
01:16:43,777 --> 01:16:47,942
He won't use you much.
He won't hurt none.

516
01:16:49,217 --> 01:16:52,584
Our grandpa was the best killer
there ever was.

517
01:16:53,421 --> 01:16:56,390
I never took all the guts to see.

518
01:16:56,925 --> 01:16:59,793
I did in 6 in 5 minutes once.

519
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:04,295
I could've done more if the hook
pulled again could've gotten the...

520
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:06,064
beaves out of the way faster.

521
01:17:07,636 --> 01:17:13,166
Now don't you cry. Grandpa is
the best. It won't hurt a bit.

522
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,212
No!

523
01:17:24,755 --> 01:17:25,744
No!

524
01:17:32,463 --> 01:17:36,400
Please! Don't!

525
01:17:51,684 --> 01:17:52,776
Hit her!

526
01:18:08,636 --> 01:18:10,035
Hit the bitch!

527
01:18:11,205 --> 01:18:12,935
Go ahead!

528
01:18:45,242 --> 01:18:48,440
Give me the hammer!

529
01:18:52,383 --> 01:18:54,078
Give me the hammer!
I'll kill her!

530
01:21:41,266 --> 01:21:46,135
Go! Go!
