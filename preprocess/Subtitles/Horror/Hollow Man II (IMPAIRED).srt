Five years ago, a team
of molecular biologists

546
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,610
broke the code
for human invisibility.

547
00:40:41,771 --> 00:40:44,250
But the program was
scrapped, almost overnight.

Why?

00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,810
All but two of the first team
were killed.

Something went
seriously wrong.

551
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:53,049
A year later, Reisner
started up again

552
00:40:53,211 --> 00:40:55,129
with covert funding
from the DOD.

553
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:58,369
The operation was codenamed
Silent Knight, with a "K."

554
00:40:58,531 --> 00:41:00,730
Cute.

555
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,008
The idea was to create
the ultimate national

556
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,529
security weapon, an
undetectable soldier.

557
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,449
Reisner managed to reproduce
the original test results.

558
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,529
Then he called me in
to correct the defects.

559
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,490
There's a flaw
in the invisibility code.

560
00:41:16,651 --> 00:41:18,050
The serum turns
human tissue invisible,

561
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,409
but it also has
horrible side effects.

562
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,769
Simply put, the serum allows
light to pass directly

563
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,330
through us...

564
00:41:24,491 --> 00:41:26,369

567
