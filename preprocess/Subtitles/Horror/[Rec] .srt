1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,873
Good evening,
this is Angela Vidal speaking.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,439
Tonight, as usual,

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,592
we will share this time...

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,989
Just a second...

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,794
- Where does the shot cut?
- Down here.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,111
Down here? You can't see my...
This hand, right?

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,508
- No.
- OK.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,628
Wait, cut.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,555
Good evening,
this is Angela Vidal speaking.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,474
Today on "While you're asleep"we are
accompanying a team of firemen

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,278
on their nightly rounds.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,238
I'm out of breath...

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,115
Good evening,
this is Angela Vidal speaking.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,670
Tonight on "While you're asleep"
we'll accompany a team of firemen

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,513
on their rounds through the city.

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,116
Not only that, but we'll see
things never before revealed:

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,795
How they live, sleep,
what they eat...

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,316
We'll get an inside look
at this fire station.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,517
Join us for "While you're asleep. "

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,351
- OK.
- OK?

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,149
If this is a pain in the ass,
just cut, OK?

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,390
I don't want to waste the tape.

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,598
Andreu, you're the boss, right?

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,751
The organizer...

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,639
Yes, I'm in charge of this shift,

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,031
both inside the fire house
and out fighting fires.

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,389
This is our helmet.
It's a full face helmet.

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,152
You can put it on, it's clean.

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,073
I'm going to be the heroine of
"While you're asleep".

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,799
Should we put them on?

31
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,839
It's easy. You're all so huge,
aren't you?

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,514
We're big, yes.
Theres are the boots.

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,477
Our pants are inside the boots.

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,632
Like in the cartoons, right?
You jump right in them!

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,553
The cartoons copied us,
not the other way around.

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,995
I'm a firefighter.

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,197
Well, let's see if...

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,519
- if there's a call.
- Yeah.

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,955
Will you let me go with you?

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,394
- Of course.
- OK.

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,118
- It's like a lottery.
- Awhat?

42
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,190
A lottery.

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,839
We might get a call,
we might not.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,035
We'll see if we do...

45
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,191
You'll see, I'll help you out.

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,116
Perfect.

47
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,871
OK.

48
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,635
We're going to the dining room.
It's dinner time.

49
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,520
- Will they mind if I come in?
- No, not at all.

50
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,195
- They know you're here.
- We can try that...

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,999
...that delicious food
that firemen make.

52
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,718
- Exactly. Very good.
- Let's go.

53
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,711
Be careful!
You'll hurt yourself.

54
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,153
- Let's go to the dining room.
- This way.

55
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,556
Hello.

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,671
- Bon appetit!
- Thanks!

57
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,354
Enjoy your meal.

58
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,910
This is Manu and Alex,
they will join you this evening.

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,834
Nice to meet you. Please,
keep eating. My name's Angela.

60
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,352
We'll accompany you tonight.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,390
Finish eating, we'll see you later.

62
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,028
- Do you want to go to the museum?
- Yes, after you.

63
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,715
Turn around.

64
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,518
I think I'll put it
in your pocket.

65
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,399
Won't it bother you
when you put on your belt?

66
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,869
I don't think so.
If it does, we can move it.

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,837
Here you have to do everything.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,433
- Let's see...
- Is this right?

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,997
- Say something.
- One, two...

70
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,151
- Hello, hello...
- OK, keep going.

71
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,750
A little more.

72
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,356
Hello, my name is Manu and
tonight the TV is here.

73
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,034
- We'll have fun... I don't know.
- OK.

74
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,475
- Ready?
- Atiny step to your right.

75
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,835
You know what?
I'm going to change sides.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,514
- Lf you don't mind. It's my hair.
- You're here?

77
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,756
So, Alex, tell us what
a normal night is like

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,558
here in the fire house.

79
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,596
A normal night
is pretty monotonous because...

80
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,069
- Normal?
- Yes, normal.

81
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,949
People think we run around

82
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,872
putting out fires, but

83
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,430
around 70% of the calls we get

84
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,636
are for other types of services.

85
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,075
- Like what?
- For example,

86
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,992
broken water mains,

87
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,277
or pet rescue, too.

88
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,193
Even though it sounds cliche,
it's true.

89
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,158
Or to...

90
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,188
This will sound terrible,
but I'd love the alarm to ring now

91
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,749
and everyone to run off.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,070
- I don't want anything to happen.
- Let's hope not.

93
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,233
I mean, just to go with you,
to see what your real work is like.

94
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,517
- Don't get me wrong.
- No, no. I understand.

95
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,592
- It's more interesting for you.
- So we can show it.

96
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,432
It's more exciting...
Let's hope nothing happens.

97
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,477
That everything is fine
and nothing happens.

98
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,835
- A routine call, right?
- Exactly.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,753
So, that's a fireman's life.

100
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,388
Waiting, passing time.

101
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,115
Watching movies

102
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,189
- In the living room, right Alex?
- Let's go there.

103
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,469
OK.

104
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,033
I can't take it.

105
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,909
What should we do?
Should we go to reception?

106
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,274
- All right.
- OK?

107
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,988
We should do something, right?

108
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,439
How exciting!

109
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,470
OK.

110
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,036
- Hello. Good evening.
- Good evening.

111
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,159
Finally! Women in the fire station.

112
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,754
Where are you going?

113
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,115
- I'm sorry...
- Don't be embarrassed.

114
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,389
Time's going by

115
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,630
and it gets quieter.
There's no one here.

116
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,871
The dining room is empty.

117
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,999
They're clean.

118
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,796
Here they're sleeping.

119
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,192
When the alarm rings,

120
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,349
they jump out of bed

121
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,311
and slide down here.

122
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,593
The fire trucks are down there.

123
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,193
We saw them before.

124
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,109
It takes them 3 minutes

125
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,353
to get up.

126
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,077
- We'll finish this later.
- We were winning!

127
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,549
<i>Person trapped in apartment,
in need of rescue.</i>

128
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,753
<i>Bravo 128 take the call.</i>

129
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,873
What'll we do?

130
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,591
I can't slide down with the camera.

131
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,830
Let's go that way. Run.

132
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,472
It's all ready.
They're really fast.

133
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,790
You back there.
On the other side.

134
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,836
I don't know if I can...

135
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,710
It's stuck.

136
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,639
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

137
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,995
Move your legs faster!
One, two, one, two...

138
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,392
Jose's driving.

139
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,313
Alex and Manu are the firemen

140
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,552
we will accompany this evening.

141
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,950
We're going to follow them,
and as we've seen

142
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,669
it's not always fires
that gets them all moving,

143
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,273
because the entire team goes out.

144
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,273
Even if it's stopping

145
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,309
a water leak, or helping someone
out of their apartment,

146
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,515
or a fire...

147
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,478
Don't you put on the...

148
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,358
what's it called... the alarm?

149
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,636
We don't normally use it
for services like these

150
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,313
because it's not urgent.

151
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,790
But if you want,
we can put it on, no problem.

152
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,991
- What do you think?
- No, I don't think so.

153
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,628
No? Well...

154
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,631
What's your show called?

155
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,313
"While you're asleep".

156
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,358
"While you're asleep"?
Then who watches it?

157
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,194
We have to do another take.
I said alarm, not siren.

158
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,353
Did it make sense?
Alarm...

159
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,876
- Ready? Come on.
- Let's go.

160
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,916
Let's go.

161
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,355
- What are you taking with you?
- Tools. We have everything

162
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,750
here in this case, tools

163
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,990
to open locks and doors.

164
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,152
We're here with Alex and Manu.

165
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,552
We're almost at

166
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,757
the house that called for help.

167
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,318
The police are here.

168
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,040
We can see a police car.

169
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,158
Maybe it's more serious
than we thought.

170
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,151
- We'll find out soon.
- No, I don't think it is.

171
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,389
Let's go in.

172
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,710
Good evening.

173
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,355
Don't worry.

174
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,431
Awoman was screaming.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,230
We were called
so we came over.

176
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,799
Please calm down.

177
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,474
- Screams? Noises?
- She lives alone with her cats.

178
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,392
- Did you make the call?
- No.

179
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,516
It was me.

180
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,272
- It was you?
- Yes.

181
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,150
I heard screams
so I called the police.

182
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,072
Let's go. She's upstairs.

183
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,356
Let's go upstairs.

184
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,229
It's about time.

185
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,152
We got a call and came over.

186
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,436
OK, this way please.

187
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,875
- What the hell is this?
- A local TV crew.

188
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,077
Please, stay here.

189
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,708
Sure, we'll sleep here if you want.

190
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,949
Miss, miss!

191
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,472
Please let us work, OK?

192
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,199
- They aren't yours, are they?
- No, they're from a local TV station.

193
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,555
They're doing a report
on how we work

194
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,234
- so they came with us.
- They're your responsibility.

195
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,753
Ladies and gentlemen!

196
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,638
Please stay in the hall.

197
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,597
Am I speaking Greek or what?

198
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,032
If I tell you to stop,
you stop taping.

199
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,519
If I tell you to get lost,
you get lost. Got it?

200
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,069
Ok. But we have permission.

201
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,798
The old lady lives
on the first floor.

202
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,075
What happened?

203
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,753
It looks like she fell.

204
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,275
They heard her scream
and called...

205
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,908
What about
those people downstairs?

206
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,870
She was screaming bloody murder.

207
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,429
The neighbors say
she's really weird.

208
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,354
She never goes out,
has no family...

209
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,511
Please, can you go with them?

210
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,991
Go down there.

211
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,993
Don't they have
anything better to do?

212
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,119
Go downstairs, damn it!

213
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,510
- Get out of the way.
- Sorry, sorry.

214
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,190
- What's the camera doing here?
- They're with the firemen.

215
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,314
We have permission, OK?

216
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,358
I'm going to do an introduction.

217
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,632
- Am I OK here?
- Yeah.

218
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,910
OK.

219
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,594
We're in front of the door

220
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,673
where an elderly resident

221
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,479
has had some sort of problem.
The neighbors heard screams.

222
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,473
Mari Carmen, who called
the fire department

223
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,390
says...

224
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,949
It's OK.

225
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,033
Whoa...

226
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,078
Ma'am, this is the police.

227
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,995
We're here to help you.
Can you hear me?

228
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,233
Ma'am, this is the police.

229
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,960
- Turn off the camera.
- I'm sorry.

230
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,439
Ma'am, can you hear the ambulance?

231
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,116
Don't worry. We're going
to take you to the hospital.

232
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,511
What's her name?

233
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,590
Conchita.

234
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,957
Conchita! Don't worry...

235
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,072
Come on, come on...

236
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,317
Don't worry,
the police are here.

237
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,115
What happened? Is she alright?

238
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,315
Shit...

239
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,997
- The light, please!
- Yeah, turn off the light.

240
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,955
Keep rolling.

241
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,193
- Stop taping!
- Sorry, OK. It's off.

242
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,319
Unit 341, please send
an ambulance immediately.

243
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,279
First floor.

244
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,035
OK. It's very urgent.

245
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,070
The ambulance is here,
don't worry, ma'am.

246
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,756
Sergio, move this, damn it.

247
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,753
I don't want anyone here
while we wait for the ambulance.

248
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,794
Fuck, she's biting him!

249
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,875
Pablo, what do I do?

250
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,631
Get her off him!

251
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,069
Holy shit! Get him out of here!

252
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,715
Help! Help!

253
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,597
- Stay with her, Alex!
- OK.

254
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,797
Help me!
Get out of the way.

255
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,509
Hurry, hurry.

256
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,750
Holy fucking shit!

257
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,717
Get out of the way!

258
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,269
Hurry! Be careful!

259
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,634
- You got him?
- Yeah.

260
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,949
Tape everything.

261
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,349
OK, wait.
Get up!

262
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,390
Pablo, tape fucking everything.

263
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,992
Holy shit, he's going
to bleed to death.

264
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,991
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

265
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,319
Stop, stop.

266
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,833
We have to stop the bleeding.

267
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,831
Come on, quick.
Here.

268
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,912
- I can't!
- Press here!

269
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,951
What the fuck's going on?
The light!

270
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,156
The light!

271
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,356
Quick! The light!

272
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,875
Fuck, come on!

273
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,112
Be careful! Cover it up!

274
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,913
Get out of the way.

275
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,352
They won't let us out.

276
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,478
- Why not?
- I don't know, they said we can't.

277
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,916
This man is wounded.
We have to get him out.

278
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,357
- We have to make a compress.
- Are you a doctor?

279
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,274
- I'm an intern.
- Take him over there.

280
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,557
Be careful with his head.

281
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,518
Hold him up.

282
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,518
Call an ambulance.

283
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,558
The door is blocked from outside.
What the fuck is going on?

284
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,109
We need an ambulance, now!

285
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,879
Calm down, please.

286
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,519
Silence, please!

287
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,511
<i>Please listen.</i>

288
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,874
<i>The health authorities
have decided to seal off</i>

289
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,996
<i>the building for safety reasons.</i>

290
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,030
<i>We're working to get you out
as soon as possible.</i>

291
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,469
<i>We ask for your cooperation.</i>

292
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,435
<i>The agents that are with you</i>

293
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,592
<i>will keep you posted
on what to do.</i>

294
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,988
<i>Follow their instructions</i>

295
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,674
<i>and remain calm. Thank you.</i>

296
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,637
- What the?
- Shit!

297
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,714
341, 341!

298
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,759
Please!

299
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,195
- What do you mean I can't...
- My friend's about to...

300
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,749
<i>We are aware of the situation.
We can't do anything for now.</i>

301
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,195
<i>We'll keep you updated.</i>

302
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,237
- Fuck!
- What did they say?

303
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,595
We have to get him out of here.
He's bleeding to death!

304
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,149
We have to get him out of here.

305
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,160
What's going on?
Why can't we leave?

306
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,118
We just can't.
Just calm down.

307
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,278
Please, stop taping,
for fuck's sake.

308
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,032
- Don't touch the camera!
- Why not?

309
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,754
Do not touch the camera!

310
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,911
We have to let everyone know
what's going on here!

311
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,150
- Fucking hell!
- Calm down.

312
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,108
I'm in charge here, and I say
turn it off and calm down.

313
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,271
Then worry about
what's going on,

314
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,637
not about whether
we tape or not.

315
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,313
Yeah. Find out what's going on.

316
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,789
- Tape this!
- Please!

317
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,234
OK, OK! We have to get
this man out of here!

318
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,317
- What's behind that shutter?
- A textile workshop.

319
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,199
- What do you mean?
- A textile workshop.

320
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,353
OK. Everyone, calm down.

321
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,795
- Is there a way out from there?
- Yes, through the back.

322
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,599
Wait a second,
move over there.

323
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,751
- How does this thing open?
- Please!

324
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,276
I'm not going to repeat this.
Move over there.

325
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,109
- What are you doing?
- Trying to get out of here.

326
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,396
Wait a second!

327
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,075
My husband's outside
and says there are loads of cops.

328
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,312
They've blocked off the street.

329
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,596
He was getting antibiotics for her.

330
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,755
Holy shit!

331
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,716
Alex!

332
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,678
No, don't move him!

333
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,673
- Yes, we have to.
- He has a pulse, don't move him!

334
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,991
- Alex! Alex!
- Shit!

335
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,638
There's somebody upstairs!

336
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,389
- Don't move him!
- Look after him.

337
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,949
Please, come with me.

338
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,672
We're going upstairs.

339
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,836
Nobody move from here, OK!

340
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,316
And you, stop fucking recording!

341
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,071
I don't care what they say,
we have to tape this.

342
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,073
We have to show
what's happening.

343
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,879
- What was that?
- I don't know, be careful.

344
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,189
Fuck!

345
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,357
It's coming from in there.

346
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,956
- Be careful.
- Where are they?

347
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,478
Move over.

348
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,356
Pablo, don't...

349
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,394
- No, Pablo, come here.
- Be quiet.

350
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,913
Pablo, come here!

351
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,159
What's going on?

352
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,071
What the fuck are you doing here?

353
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,390
Be careful.

354
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,314
She's dead.

355
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,870
Don't move, ma'am.

356
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,392
Ma'am.

357
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,278
Don't move!

358
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,588
Let's go.

359
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,918
She jumped on me...

360
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,239
I know, relax.

361
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,630
- You saw her, right?
- Yeah, I did.

362
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,268
- I couldn't do anything.
- Let's go downstairs.

363
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,829
I know, don't worry.
Let's go.

364
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,228
Fucking asshole!

365
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,310
- Did you get it?
- I got everything.

366
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,711
- Let me see it.
- Don't worry. I got it.

367
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,799
Fucking show it to me!
How do I have to say it?

368
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,195
Get this, Pablo! Come on!

369
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,717
You stay here with the wounded.

370
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,677
I'm going to check the exit.

371
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,875
Just a second.

372
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,838
We have strict orders
to stay in the hall.

373
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,592
Help me out here.

374
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,028
These men are dying.
Fuck orders!

375
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,556
He's right.
You shouldn't tell us...

376
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,114
There are two dead people,

377
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,350
that died violent deaths.

378
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,512
And two that need urgent
medical attention.

379
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,671
The police have blocked
off the area,

380
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,912
they are keeping us in here,
with no explanations.

381
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,878
So, we're searching
for another way out.

382
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,519
She's getting worse.

383
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,319
Her fever's gone up.
She needs a doctor.

384
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,311
<i>Listen up.</i>

385
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,631
<i>Do not try to leave the building.</i>

386
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,598
<i>All exits have been sealed.</i>

387
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,678
<i>A BNC protocol situation
has been declared.</i>

388
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,035
<i>Shortly a health inspector
will come to assess the situation.</i>

389
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,156
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

390
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,396
Why are we locked in here?

391
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,154
And what do they mean
by a health inspector?

392
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,118
- I don't know.
- What's an BNC protocol?

393
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,592
What's an BNC protocol?
What does BNC mean?

394
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,159
It's a proceedure used

395
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,278
in Biological, Nuclear,
or Chemical threat situations.

396
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,236
What? Nuclear?

397
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,836
It's more usual than you think.

398
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,117
The wounded are stable,
but they won't hang on much longer.

399
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,511
- We have to get them out of here.
- Obviously not through here.

400
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,194
So, Ladies, Gentlemen,
come this way.

401
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,828
No! There's something more
to this place.

402
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,197
Our cells don't work.
Neither does the TV or radio.

403
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,954
- We're isolated. Why?
- I don't know why.

404
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,031
I can't get through
to my husband.

405
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,158
- And my daughter has a high fever.
- What's wrong with her?

406
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,833
She has tonsilitis.

407
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,588
- She's burning up.
- What can I do?

408
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,355
From the office
we canjump down on the patio.

409
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,999
I'm going with you.

410
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,115
Where are you going?

411
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,196
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, it's not very high up.

412
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,397
How are we going to get in?

413
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,269
What?

414
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,675
The concierge has a copy of the key.

415
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,832
I gave it to him.
I'm in charge of the building.

416
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,399
Let's go.

417
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,438
There was someone else
in the woman's apartment.

418
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,033
What do you mean someone else?
Who?

419
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,633
I don't know. A girl.

420
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,312
Probably the Colombian girl.
Why didn't she come down with you?

421
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,913
She's dead.

422
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,118
Let's go. Open it, quick!

423
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,309
This way.

424
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,349
It's this way.

425
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,079
Let's go.

426
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,435
Help me.

427
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,351
Fuck...

428
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,830
<i>Go back immediately,
for your own safety.</i>

429
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,036
No, listen!

430
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,474
<i>Get back.</i>

431
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,632
<i>We're sealing off the building.</i>

432
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,632
<i>- Ready up there? Go ahead.
- Listen!</i>

433
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,268
Listen to me!

434
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,875
Listen! Can you see me?

435
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,998
Can you hear me?

436
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,512
What are you doing there?
I told you to wait downstairs.

437
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,513
Remember I'm still in charge.

438
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,671
- You knew about this, didn't you?
- About what?

439
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,559
That they're sealing us in.
Like hamsters!

440
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,756
<i>Step back!
For your own safety.</i>

441
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,990
- What the hell is this?
- You tell us!

442
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,354
I don't know!

443
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,636
<i>- I repeat, step back!
- You! That's enough!</i>

444
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,075
- Why?
- Stop messing with the camera.

445
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,312
We have to show
what's going on.

446
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,038
- Don't you get it?
- Don't touch me.

447
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,475
It's the only proof we have.
Can't you see that?

448
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,519
You're locked in herejust like us.
They don't care about you either.

449
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,240
Shut up!

450
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,269
Please, go down to the workshop.

451
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,631
- Let's all calm down.
- Shut up!

452
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,712
Yes, we're going. Put the gun down.

453
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,671
<i>Remain calm.</i>

454
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,595
<i>We apologize for the inconvenience.</i>

455
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,955
<i>It is of utmost importance</i>

456
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,032
<i>that you follow the agent's
instructions.</i>

457
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,395
<i>He is in the building with you.</i>

458
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,028
<i>Do not try to leave the building.</i>

459
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,829
<i>I repeat, do not try
to leave the building.</i>

460
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,758
Hold this. Relax, man...

461
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,952
Let's go with the others.

462
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,279
I'm really sorry.

463
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,752
Please, go downstairs.

464
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,751
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

465
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,790
Let me go up to my apartment.

466
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,709
I have sutures and bandages...

467
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,436
Yes...

468
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,313
It's nearly 2 a. m. And we're
still sealed in this building that

469
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,517
we came to with the firemen
earlier this evening,

470
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,638
to assist an elderly lady
who later attacked a policeman

471
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,793
and a fireman. They're both
in critical condition.

472
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,839
The police won't let us leave
and are giving us no explanations.

473
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,356
The neighbors are scared to death.

474
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,909
They want to go back home,

475
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,832
they want to know
what's going on.

476
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,313
Guillem, do you mind if
I ask you a few quick questions?

477
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,833
I've never been in such
a serious situation before.

478
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,072
I'm an intern. I give shots,

479
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,232
take people's blood pressure.
I live in this building.

480
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,229
Well, the injured are
in critical condition.

481
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,994
This is very serious.

482
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,431
The police have several bite wounds.

483
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,033
He's very injured.

484
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,038
What's obvious is that

485
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,078
Mrs. Izquierdo attacked
and bit them.

486
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,588
I guess

487
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,435
she had a fit of hysteria.

488
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,795
But honestly, it's hard to believe.

489
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,836
That...

490
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,879
an old lady could do
something like this to two adults.

491
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,792
I guess when the doctor arrives,

492
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,589
apart from bringing supplies
to treat the wounded,

493
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,432
he'll tell us what's going on.

494
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,990
We're locked in here, the police
are outside, we can't get out,

495
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,232
we have no explanations.
They know these men are here,

496
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,279
and we have to get them out soon.
They've lost a lot of blood.

497
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,078
I can't do anything else.

498
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,430
Stay with them. Thanks.

499
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,719
We're going to keep on interviewing.
If you don't like something

500
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,632
you can cut. OK?

501
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,190
I would like you to tell us

502
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,193
what's happened this evening,

503
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,432
what's gone on.

504
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,592
I can't say too much because
I was sleeping.

505
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,593
I heard loud screams.

506
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,752
Of course I woke him up,
threw on what clothes I could,

507
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,148
and came down here.

508
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,193
I have to change my clothes,
I can't...

509
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,590
Something strange is going on.

510
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,479
Someone did something,
that's why we're locked in here.

511
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,119
This building has always been...

512
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,068
- Wait! Can I talk?
- Why can't I say it?

513
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,429
There's something...

514
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,990
Yes, someone said that there was a...

515
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,152
- An office, a window...
- I don't know what it's called.

516
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,117
A... That there was a...

517
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,113
what they used to do when
there were atomic bombs.

518
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,874
- A BNC protocol.
- A refuge or something.

519
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,712
What a rucus.

520
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,474
If we knew that when you got here,
we would have said:

521
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,551
Look, this is what happened.
Let everyone know.

522
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,154
- But we have no idea.
- But, in summary...

523
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,512
Fireman, fireman, yes...

524
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,992
Fireman fell! Fireman fell!

525
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,555
- He fell and left...
- Fell from where?

526
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,996
From up there... up, yes.

527
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,429
- You were saying?
- He fell from above.

528
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,874
From where?

529
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,754
Where? I don't know.

530
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,195
But from above, right?
I don't know.

531
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,079
- From the stairwell?
- Yes.

532
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,273
Stairwell like this and...

533
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,753
he fell in the middle. Yes.

534
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,793
Pablo, is this OK or should
I sit lower?

535
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,839
At her level.

536
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,436
What's your name?
I wan't everyone to know.

537
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,354
- Jennifer.
- What a beautiful name, Jennifer!

538
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,035
- How old are you?
- Seven.

539
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,760
She just had her birthday.

540
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,193
Great. So what happened?
Are you sick?

541
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,395
Yes.

542
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,469
We know you can't take
your medicine, right?

543
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,629
Yes.

544
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,916
Why not?

545
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,640
Because my husband isn't allowed in.

546
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,793
Please do not speak right now,

547
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,520
only the girl is in the shot and...

548
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,715
- Sorry.
- Since there is no microphone,

549
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,677
we can't hear your voice
and everything gets messed up.

550
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,400
We'll interview you later, OK?

551
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,913
You don't have to...

552
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,840
So, besides your father...

553
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,718
Who do you live with?

554
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,159
With my mommy, my daddy

555
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,197
and my dog, Max.

556
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,397
Your dog isn't here either, right?
I can't see him.

557
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,715
No, he's not.

558
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,189
- Do you love your dog?
- Yes.

559
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,551
Why isn't he here?

560
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,235
He's at the vet.

561
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,473
- What's wrong with him?
- He got sick.

562
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,195
I knew something would happen
sooner or later.

563
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,591
A fire or something serious.

564
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,916
There must be something upstairs.

565
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,470
If not, I don't get why people
fall like that...

566
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,916
they fall down through
the stairwell, bleeding all over.

567
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,516
I can't go up to my house.

568
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,309
So, here we are.

569
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,796
I am going to sue.

570
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,748
I am definitely going to sue.

571
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,675
I'm going to call the newspapers,

572
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,799
and have them write
about what happened.

573
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,988
From the beginning until the very end.

574
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,793
- Cesar?
- Hello.

575
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,430
Hi. Sorry, but could I ask you
a few questions?

576
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,238
Wait... OK, yes.

577
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,320
We want to cover the story.

578
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,836
- Are you recording already?
- No.

579
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,878
- OK, rolling.
- Wait, I'll sit like this.

580
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,037
If you prefer
one side in particular...

581
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,551
Have you lived here for long?

582
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,713
Yes, I used to live with my mom.
She died, so now I live alone.

583
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,194
It's the Chinese.

584
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,752
They eat raw.

585
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,435
Raw fish. It smells...

586
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,670
They always leave the door open.

587
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,717
I don't know why.

588
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,838
I mean, if they were the nice kind
that do Feng Shui

589
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,594
and cool stuff... But no.

590
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,469
They come in and out screaming
in Chinese all the time,

591
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,474
in Japanese, I don't know.
Something I don't understand.

592
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,597
When are we starting?

593
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,116
- We did.
- Why didn't you tell me?

594
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,999
Don't you see my face is shiny?

595
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,279
I think this profile's better, right?

596
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,398
- Yes. Great.
- Like this, Pablo?

597
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,436
Good.

598
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,436
OK, silence please.

599
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,273
Silence. Ma'am.

600
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,951
- I just spoke to them outside.
- It's about time!

601
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,113
They told me the health inspector
is on his way in.

602
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,869
- Health inspector?
- Yes.

603
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,794
There is a possible infection
in the building.

604
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,995
An infection?

605
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,435
Yes, but please calm down.

606
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,353
They're just going to take
blood samples

607
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,239
of all the residents
to clarify things.

608
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,358
- Only of the residents?
- No, of everyone here.

609
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,995
When they see everything's OK,

610
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,628
they'll let us out.

611
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,391
Great.

612
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,118
We ask you to cooperate.

613
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,716
We're going to check

614
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,030
if everyone is here.

615
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,509
A simple "here"will be fine, OK?

616
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,113
Let's start.

617
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,193
The main floor on the left
is the office where we were before.

618
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,312
Who lives in the apartment
on the right?

619
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,392
That's the Colombian girl's apartment.

620
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,389
First floor, right...

621
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,596
That's where Mrs. Izquierdo
lives, right?

622
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,954
- First floor, left?
- Me.

623
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,588
Me, my daughter and my husband
who's been outside for a long time.

624
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,593
Yes, we know, lady. Calm down.

625
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,591
- Second floor, left?
- Us.

626
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,557
- You?
- No, we're the third.

627
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,597
- No, we live...
- Do you or don't you?

628
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,830
- Third...
- We live on the second.

629
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,072
- I'm lost.
- Calm down, sir, you're tired.

630
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,832
Second, left.

631
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,355
- Yes. Second, right?
- Present.

632
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,158
- Third, left?
- Here.

633
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,390
- Third, right?
- Yes, that's us!

634
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,755
- You three?
- No, four of us.

635
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,989
- Four?
- My father.

636
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,913
- Your father?
- He upstairs.

637
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,640
- Where is he?
- He on bed.

638
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,234
My father sick.

639
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,676
What she means is
he's old and paralytic.

640
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,877
- Exactly, my father is sick.
- Maybe all this is his fault.

641
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,393
Listen up!

642
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,120
We're going to finish.

643
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,998
Does anyone live in the penthouse?

644
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,957
No, nobody lives there.

645
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,554
A man from Madrid owns it,
but he's never there.

646
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,358
It's been closed up for years.

647
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,470
Excuse me?

648
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,915
- My father come down, yes?
- That's not a good idea,

649
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,640
what if he's the cause of all this.

650
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,074
My father's sick!

651
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,073
- He has to come down here with us.
- I don't understand you.

652
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,233
Be respectful. Calm down.

653
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,595
Your child is sick too and...

654
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,432
My daughter has tonsilitis!

655
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,672
Nobody move until the doctor says so.

656
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,439
<i>We're going in.
Don't open the door until we say so.</i>

657
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,353
<i>Wait.</i>

658
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,748
<i>Go ahead, 341.</i>

659
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,273
OK, over.

660
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,553
What's this?

661
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,118
They'll keep telling us
nothing's wrong, right?

662
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,992
Pablo, I'm going in.

663
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,032
- OK.
- As we...

664
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,193
As we were told, the health inspector
is in the building.

665
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,830
There are incredible
security measures in place.

666
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,319
We know nothing,

667
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,278
they haven't told us a thing.

668
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,796
We saw Special Forces,
health inspectors

669
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,110
wearing suits and masks

670
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,159
and it's not very comforting.

671
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,276
That's all we know.

672
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,433
Take me to them.
The rest stay here.

673
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,672
What is a TV crew doing here?

674
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,040
Jennifer! Don't touch that.

675
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,156
- Why?
- Because I say so.

676
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,275
Pablo, can you come here?

677
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,235
Thanks.
What a pain in the ass.

678
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,393
Don't you think this inspection
has to do with that old lady?

679
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,989
I don't know.

680
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,912
The policeman and the fireman
have been bitten.

681
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,834
If it's contagious, they could react
like the old lady.

682
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,797
Don't scare me...

683
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,998
Fuck, what a day.

684
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,997
Pablo, grab the camera.
I can't sit here doing nothing.

685
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,319
It's recording...
and the lens is dirty.

686
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,355
Someone's been messing around here.

687
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,400
It doesn't matter.
Let's try to get something.

688
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,028
Shit!

689
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,475
Come here.

690
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,789
There. Look.

691
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,755
Hold this.

692
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,279
Be careful, Pablo.

693
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,794
Give it to me.

694
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,112
Can you see anything?

695
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,079
What can you see?

696
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,037
- They're handcuffing him.
- Who?

697
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,277
Pablo, what can you see?

698
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,751
Tell me what you see!

699
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,350
Say something!

700
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,351
- What are they saying?
- I can't hear them.

701
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,550
- What's that?
- What?

702
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,958
I don't know. The doctor
has something in his hands.

703
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,829
- It's a needle.
- What's he doing?

704
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,594
- I don't know. Wait.
- What are they doing, Pablo?

705
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,918
They're injecting the fireman
with something.

706
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,635
Pablo!

707
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,036
More handcuffs.

708
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,716
- Holy shit!
- What's going on?

709
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,275
Shit!

710
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,551
What's that, Pablo?

711
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,838
Say something!
What's going on in there?

712
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,998
Why are they screaming?

713
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,352
Pablo, answer me!

714
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,199
Go, go. Run!

715
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,114
- What's going on in there?
- Go, go!

716
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,998
What's going on?

717
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,231
What are you doing?
Guillem's in there.

718
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,709
Guillem's still in there!

719
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,110
He got bitten, we can't let him out.

720
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,999
- What are you talking about?
- He didn't bite me!

721
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,116
It spreads through saliva.

722
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,476
We can't risk letting him out.

723
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,837
We don't know if he's been bitten!

724
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,672
The infected ones are handcuffed.

725
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,308
Just stay away from them.

726
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,152
Infected with what?

727
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,199
- What's going on?
- A minute ago they were fine!

728
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,078
What the fuck is all this about?

729
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,233
The reaction time depends
on the blood type. We can't predict...

730
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,839
Fuck! Hurry up! Run!

731
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,557
Come on, hurry up!

732
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,190
Now tell us
what the hell is going on here.

733
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,352
- I'm not authorized...
- Bullshit!

734
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,671
I just killed a cop
who tried to bite us.

735
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,469
Tell us everything you know.

736
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,437
OK.

737
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,677
Yesterday we received

738
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,235
a call from a vet

739
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,313
who had a dog brought in
with an unknown disease.

740
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,031
The dog went into a coma

741
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,199
and a few moments later came to

742
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,151
and was extraordinarily aggressive.

743
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,959
He started attacking all of
the pets at the clinic.

744
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,509
We had to give him
several tranquilizers

745
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,238
and then put him to sleep.

746
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,188
We followed the chip in his ear
which led us to this building.

747
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,392
- Was the dog called Max?
- Yes.

748
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,915
She only has tonsilitis.

749
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,873
- Bullshit, tonsilitis.
- Relax, ma'am...

750
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,910
We just have to be sure.

751
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,674
Calm down.

752
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,109
It's just tonsilitis.

753
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,477
We think the dog spread the infection

754
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,200
through his saliva.

755
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,679
If that's true...

756
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,354
Handcuffs! Get the handcuffs!

757
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,557
- Hold her!
- Jennifer!

758
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,276
Jennifer!

759
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,156
The cuffs!

760
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,312
Jennifer!

761
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,756
Relax, we'll get her.

762
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,918
Father downstairs.
My father come down!

763
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,640
- What father?
- Her father's sick in bed.

764
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,392
And you didn't tell me?

765
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,197
We can't have infected people
loose out there.

766
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,354
We gave you specific orders
to get everyone together downstairs.

767
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,353
We had no idea. We thought
everyone was here.

768
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,233
Take this. Get her
and inject her with this.

769
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,038
Everyone must come down here.

770
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,159
Get this on tape!

771
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,038
Be careful, Pablo!

772
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,428
Jennifer?

773
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,350
What the hell is that?

774
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,478
Fucking hell!

775
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,432
- The old lady isn't there.
- Neither is the other one.

776
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,959
Jennifer?

777
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,634
Jennifer.

778
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,437
There's no one here. Wait.

779
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,671
She's over there. Look!

780
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,674
Fuck!

781
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,076
Jennifer, relax.

782
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,838
Relax.

783
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,036
Give me the needle.
The needle!

784
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,599
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

785
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,592
Be careful, man.

786
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,875
Jennifer.

787
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,953
Relax.

788
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,632
Give me your hand.

789
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,158
- Be careful.
- Give me your hand.

790
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,476
What happened to her eyes?

791
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,594
Shit!

792
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,708
Be careful!

793
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,314
Shit! Get out of the way!

794
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,916
Go, she bit me!

795
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,954
She bit me, can't you see?

796
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,311
Go, for fuck's sake!

797
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,109
Go!

798
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,679
Let's go!

799
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,960
No down!

800
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,078
Don't go down there!

801
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,758
They're getting away!

802
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,111
Help me!

803
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,633
Take these off of me!

804
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,155
- Don't touch me!
- Son of a bitch!

805
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,834
Take them off!

806
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,512
I don't have it.

807
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,750
I don't have the key!

808
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,353
What do you mean?

809
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,830
- The policeman has it.
- Fuck!

810
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,036
- The shutter!
- What?

811
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,316
Help!

812
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,633
Help, you bastard!

813
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,559
Don't go!

814
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,878
Get away!

815
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,957
We have to get her out of here.

816
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,560
- Let's go.
- No!

817
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,075
I'm sorry!

818
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,549
Don't leave me here!

819
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,510
This way, come on.

820
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,999
Hurry up!

821
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,393
The lock!

822
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,471
It looks like they're leaving.

823
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,232
They're going upstairs.

824
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,072
- Were you bitten?
- No.

825
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,070
- Angela?
- No.

826
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,958
- You?
- No.

827
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,032
- Did you find the little girl?
- Who cares about the girl?

828
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,111
It's out of control.

829
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,917
Pablo, what the hell were they
doing to that woman?

830
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,273
They were eating her alive, Manu.
What the hell is this?

831
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,431
I don't know!

832
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,273
They could all be infected by now.

833
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,470
- We have to get out of here.
- I'm not moving!

834
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,633
No! We can stay here

835
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,554
until they come to get us.
These things...

836
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,314
No one's going to come get us!

837
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,277
- Yes!
- Open your fucking eyes!

838
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,750
They don't give a shit!
They're going to let us die here!

839
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,151
But the doctor
does matter to them.

840
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,039
- They'll come get the doctor.
- The doctor? Why?

841
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,634
- He is in there.
- Son of a bitch!

842
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,518
- Where?
- There!

843
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,319
I'm gonna kill you!

844
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,154
I've been bitten. Go away.

845
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,279
Get lost.

846
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,318
I've been bitten!

847
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,828
Get back!

848
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,594
Go away!

849
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,159
Shit, shit...

850
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,155
The door won't hold.

851
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,596
- Go away.
- Son of a bitch!

852
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,998
Get us out of here!

853
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,355
<i>Stand away from the windows!</i>

854
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,432
<i>We repeat:
Stay away from the windows</i>

855
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,672
<i>or we will be forced
to take drastic measures.</i>

856
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,310
<i>Follow the inspector's
instructions.</i>

857
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,911
There might be a way out.

858
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,993
Pablo, there might be a way out!

859
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,030
Listen!

860
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,476
There's an underground storage
area in the workshop

861
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,315
that has a drain cover that joins
up with the sewers.

862
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,269
Can you hear me?

863
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,076
- In the workshop there's a basement...
- Are you sure?

864
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,233
Yes, we can escape through there.
The problem is the reinforced door.

865
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,551
- How the hell will we open it?
- With the key!

866
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,789
The intern is in charge.
He has all the keys.

867
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,428
- Where?
- In his apartment.

868
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,436
Let's go! Let's go!

869
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,557
He's been bitten!

870
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,431
Hurry up!

871
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,394
They're not there.

872
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,555
Manu, we have to find the way out.
We need the storage key.

873
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,870
Yeah, but... how?

874
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,952
The intern has the key,
but we don't know where he lives.

875
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,712
You checked the list!

876
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,113
- I can't remember.
- Pablo?

877
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,998
I don't remember either.

878
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,793
Manu, think.
I'm sure you can remember.

879
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,590
- I can't remember!
- Think, Manu!

880
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,159
Guillem! The mailboxes!

881
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,079
He's called Guillem...

882
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,149
Downstairs, quick!
Angela, hurry up!

883
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,992
Hurry up!

884
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,229
Guillem Marimn, third floor n2!

885
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,269
She's cuffed.
We can get by.

886
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,389
We have to go upstairs.

887
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,389
Upstairs!

888
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,874
Be careful, Angela!

889
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,273
Pablo, help me!

890
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,310
Wait. OK.

891
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,429
Drop her.

892
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,152
- I got bitten!
- No, you didn't.

893
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,311
I saw it. You didn't.

894
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,550
Let's go upstairs.
Pablo, help.

895
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,156
- Come on, get up.
- I got bitten!

896
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,278
You did not, Angela.
I saw it, you didn't.

897
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,035
Let's go, Pablo! Hurry up!

898
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,234
Hurry up!

899
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,710
Shit!

900
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,997
- The light!
- Where's the switch?

901
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,038
- On the wall!
- I can't find it!

902
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,556
- Pablo, the spotlight! Turn it on!
- I'm trying!

903
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,357
Quickly!

904
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,349
Move it! Move it!

905
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,149
Shit! Go upstairs, hurry!

906
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,874
The mallet, Angela!

907
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,071
Go upstairs, quickly!

908
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,149
It's here.

909
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,715
Move.

910
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,398
Hurry up. I'll wait here.

911
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,074
I'll go there.

912
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,679
Where are they?

913
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,958
Look in the drawers.

914
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,948
Where the hell are they?

915
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,712
We have to get out.

916
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,832
- Here, here!
- Shit, where are they?

917
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,069
Shit!

918
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,399
The keys...

919
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,309
Where are...

920
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,751
The keys!

921
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,189
Which ones are they?

922
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,794
Which ones are they?

923
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,996
I don't know. Grab them all.

924
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,869
Let's go.

925
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,477
Where's Manu?

926
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,151
Upstairs, run!

927
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:18,312
Go to the penthouse!
The key must be in the bunch.

928
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,068
Come on, Angela!

929
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,913
Which one is it?

930
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,193
This one!

931
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:45,034
- Turn on the spotlight.
- I can't!

932
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,119
- The light is loose.
- Fix it, Pablo!

933
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,032
I'm trying!

934
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,476
They're leaving.

935
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,470
- Pablo, turn it on!
- Calm down.

936
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,631
This is the apartment
that was closed up.

937
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:07,873
- No one will be in here.
- Turn it on, please.

938
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,716
OK.

939
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,269
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

940
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,549
What the hell is all this?

941
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,039
Pablo, over here.

942
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,719
Where?

943
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,119
Holy shit!

944
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,591
- What does this mean?
- I don't know.

945
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,555
- Pablo!
- What?

946
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,316
"The Vatican is investigating...

947
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,398
the possible possession
of a Portuguese girl. "

948
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,318
PORTUGAL IS MOVED BY
THE CASE OF A POSSESSED GIRL

949
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,596
- Fuck...
- The possessed girl.

950
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,478
THE MEDEIROS CASE ON HOLD

951
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,278
Pablo, look!

952
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,430
It's the same girl!

953
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,869
What the hell is this?

954
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,070
It's all about the same.

955
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,233
"The hospital denies releasing
the girl who disappeared in the night"

956
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,231
Pablo!

957
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,754
Calm down.

958
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,634
It must be the pipes.

959
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,114
Calm down, we'll find a way out.

960
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,391
We have to get out of here.

961
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,437
Be careful. Stay close.

962
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,552
Didn't they say no one lived here?

963
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,797
Calm down.

964
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,875
Pablo.

965
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,235
Over here.

966
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,313
What's that?

967
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,709
They're still talking about the same.

968
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,156
What the hell is this?

969
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,710
- Angela, let's go.
- Wait!

970
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,838
It must have something
to do with...

971
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,149
Look!

972
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,637
A tape recorder.

973
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,950
- There's no electricity.
- It's off.

974
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,436
There.

975
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,960
<i>I've finally isolated the enzyme.</i>

976
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,315
<i>The problem is that it's unstable.</i>

977
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:45,828
<i>It deteriorates when it
comes into contact with oxygen.</i>

978
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,671
<i>I am, however, optmistic.</i>

979
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,674
<i>If all goes well
we'll have a vaccine soon.</i>

980
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,513
<i>The analyses were successful.</i>

981
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,637
What the hell is he talking about?

982
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,158
<i>Something unexpected has happened.</i>

983
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,153
<i>The enzyme is not only resistant
but has mutated.</i>

984
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,954
<i>It behaves much like the flu.</i>

985
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,240
<i>This leads us
to a horrible conclusion.</i>

986
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:19,677
<i>It might be contagious.</i>

987
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,319
I don't get it.

988
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,231
<i>The telegram from Rome
has arrived.</i>

989
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,876
<i>The Medeiros girl
must die.</i>

990
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:29,235
He's talking about the girl, Pablo.

991
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,959
She was here.

992
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,558
<i>I must eliminate her and erase
all signs of her existence.</i>

993
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,518
What the hell is this guy saying?

994
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,557
<i>Finally my prayers
have been answered.</i>

995
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,597
We have to get out of here.

996
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,558
<i>This decision should
have been made years ago.</i>

997
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,795
<i>This has all been a big mistake.</i>

998
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,913
<i>I must follow the procedures.</i>

999
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,230
<i>The ritual is very specific.</i>

1000
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,435
Come here. Stay close.

1001
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,830
<i>I'm going to seal off the room.</i>

1002
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,759
<i>The seal should keep her in.</i>

1003
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:09,110
<i>If anything goes wrong,
may God help us.</i>

1004
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:20,509
Wait.

1005
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,479
- I'm going to look.
- No!

1006
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:28,632
There might be a way out
through the attic.

1007
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,598
- We have to give it a try.
- What are you going to do?

1008
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,149
I'll record what's up there
and we can look at it.

1009
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,670
Pablo. Bring the camera down.

1010
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:45,115
There are really weird noises.

1011
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,314
- What happened?
- Something hit the camera.

1012
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,040
Turn it on.

1013
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,270
The fucking light broke!

1014
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,274
- Turn it on, Pablo!
- I can't, it's busted.

1015
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,031
- Fuck! What now?
- Relax. Don't move.

1016
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,231
I'll turn on the night vision.

1017
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,680
OK, I can see you now.

1018
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,390
That's good.

1019
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,717
Stick your hand out.

1020
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,440
- I can't see you. Where are you?
- OK, I got you.

1021
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,109
Relax, it's me.

1022
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,072
I can see if I use the camera.

1023
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,595
Get behind me and don't let go.

1024
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,473
We'll be OK.
We're going to get out.

1025
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:49,828
I'll find the way out.

1026
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,638
Don't let go, OK?

1027
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,796
- Stay still.
- Why?

1028
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,831
There's something.
Go back.

1029
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,633
Don't make a sound.

1030
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,429
Get down.

1031
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,828
Keep quiet, for God's sake!

1032
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,908
It can't see us.
If it can't hear us, it won't find us.

1033
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,112
Let's go.

1034
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,716
- Run!
- Pablo!

1035
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,798
Run!

1036
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,197
Answer me!
I can't hear you!

1037
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:48,869
Pablo.

1038
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,150
We have to tape everything, Pablo.
For fuck's sake.
