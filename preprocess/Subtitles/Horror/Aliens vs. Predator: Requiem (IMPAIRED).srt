is because your guidance counselor begged me to give it to you

Negative,
I'll gonna make a final pass by the ridge.

is such a hot idea.

We do not know what we dealing with.

They're so much blood.

They're all gone.
She is dead. She's dead.

310

Ricky, get her inside.
Get her in.

311
00:53:21,564 --> 00:53:24,535
Hey, people are dying.

312
00:53:24,606 --> 00:53:25,598
We need guns.

313

-The National Guard will be here soon.
- Not soon enough.

314
00:53:41,069 --> 00:53:42,814
I can't believe I'm letting you do this.

315
00:53:43,544 --> 00:53:46,202
This plan is stupid.
Let's just leave town now.

316
00:53:46,261 --> 00:53:48,774
Cause we're not gonna make it without weapons.
Dickhead!

317

You just stupid to talk, Dale
Shut up.

318
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:09,764
Where are the guns?
- Follow me.

319
00:54:19,707 --> 00:54:20,624
Here they are.

320
00:54:24,534 --> 00:54:27,221
Dale, pass some bags.
Jessie, load them up.

321

Yeah, I just need some light.

00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:10,350
0-2 has secured the perimeter.

329
00:55:14,176 --> 00:55:16,378
This is Sheriff Morales, to the National Guard,
come in.

330
00:55:16,695 --> 00:55:19,155
Repeat, Sheriff Morales, to the National Guard,
come in.

331
00:55:19,254 --> 00:55:23,554
This is Lieutenant Woods, 89th Troop Command
Colorado National Guard.

332
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:24,854
Go ahead, Sheriff.

333
00:55:25,648 --> 00:55:27,512
What is your location
Lieutenant, over?

334
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:29,674
We are on Main Street.

335
00:55:30,277 --> 00:55:32,308
Listen, Lieutenant, I don't know what
your men is walking into.

336
00:55:32,347 --> 00:55:34,708
But our situation is getting worse.

337
00:55:43,314 --> 00:55:45,178
Lieutenant, come in.
Are you there?

338
00:55:45,868 --> 00:55:47,876
- We've got a missing man.
- Hold on, Sheriff.

339
00:56:07,528 --> 00:56:13,098
We've got gunshots...[indistinct chatter]
It's a fucking ambushed!

340
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:19,584
What the hell's going on out there?

341
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,316
Pull back.
I repeat, pull back.

342
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:34,788
Lieutenant.

343
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:45,688
Lieutenant, are you there?
[Static]

344
00:56:45,764 --> 00:56:48,821
Lieutenant, come in.
Are you there?

345
00:56:56,564 --> 00:56:58,219
We're not gonna make
it are we?

346
00:57:07,762 --> 00:57:09,392
Don't shoot, take what you want.

347
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:12,119
I'm not getting killed for
6.25 an hour.

348
00:57:15,793 --> 00:57:16,512
We've been attacked.

349
00:57:17,406 --> 00:57:18,761
Terrorists had done this sir?

350
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:21,636
I told you they would, one day.

351
00:57:23,877 --> 00:57:24,952
What you guys, stoned?

352
00:57:30,169 --> 00:57:31,201
Do you see that?

353
00:57:50,086 --> 00:57:50,771
Are you hurt?

354
00:57:54,024 --> 00:57:54,948
Come on in.

355
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,444
It should be safe here.

356
00:58:12,185 --> 00:58:13,401
Hold on.

357
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:19,565
No pulse and breathing.
Take him straight to intensive care.

358
00:59:02,514 --> 00:59:03,982
When's the light going back on?

359
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,997
We are on emergency generators,
until the power's restored.

360
00:59:12,123 --> 00:59:13,571
Oh! I think my water just broke.

361
00:59:14,483 --> 00:59:15,217
- Ohh...
-Ok.

362
00:59:16,149 --> 00:59:16,923
I will find the doctor.

363
01:00:02,635 --> 01:00:06,543
- You two look pretty shaken up.
- Hasn't been an easy night for her.

364
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:11,216
And what about you?

365
01:00:13,668 --> 01:00:14,600
I'll live.

366
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:21,760
We're leaving in 5 minutes.

367
01:00:23,724 --> 01:00:24,537
Thank you.

368
01:00:47,054 --> 01:00:47,768
Where is he?

369
01:01:01,084 --> 01:01:03,047
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

370
01:01:08,763 --> 01:01:09,358
Come on.

371
01:01:20,478 --> 01:01:21,073
Mommy.

372
01:01:26,066 --> 01:01:27,157
Turn back.
It's a trap.

373
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:30,033
It's a trap.
It's a trap.

374
01:01:32,782 --> 01:01:33,285
Go.

375
01:01:33,286 --> 01:01:36,400
Molly, took off. Run
Run Molly.

376
01:01:39,297 --> 01:01:42,436
Come here.
- My God.

377
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:45,159
Fuckers...

378
01:01:52,795 --> 01:01:56,308
What is this fucking shit?

379
01:02:03,794 --> 01:02:06,333
What was that thing?

380
01:02:38,243 --> 01:02:39,512
That's not possible.

381
01:02:41,198 --> 01:02:43,340
Something's wrong.
Check the other room.

382
01:03:29,863 --> 01:03:31,854
Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.

383
01:03:32,802 --> 01:03:36,223
What the hell?
- This is our help?

384
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:42,379
What the fuck is going on,
Eddie?

385
01:03:42,439 --> 01:03:45,133
- Where are all the bodies?
- They are gonna kill us all.

386
01:03:45,523 --> 01:03:46,614
We are not dead yet.

387
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:49,490
There may be weapons we can still use.

388
01:03:58,709 --> 01:03:59,899
Radio.

389
01:04:06,511 --> 01:04:07,681
National Guard, come in.

390
01:04:09,327 --> 01:04:11,667
Repeat, any National Guard unit,
come in.

391
01:04:14,316 --> 01:04:16,577
This is Colonel Stevens, US Army.
Identify yourself.

392
01:04:17,872 --> 01:04:20,014
Sheriff Eddie Morales,
Guns in Colorado.

393
01:04:20,475 --> 01:04:23,247
You have to help us, Colonel.
There some kind of infestation and if

394
01:04:23,252 --> 01:04:25,751
And if we don't get help soon,
there won't be any of us left.

395
01:04:26,752 --> 01:04:28,200
What's the Army's evacuation plan?

396
01:04:29,906 --> 01:04:30,342
Colonel?

397
01:04:35,411 --> 01:04:37,256
Colonel, we need immediate evac.

398
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:40,350
Sheriff, all ground routes
have been compromised.

399
01:04:41,173 --> 01:04:45,057
There is an airlift, in 30 minutes
from Gilliam Circle.

400
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:49,350
Confirmed. Airlift. Gilliam Circle.
We will be there in 20 minutes.

401
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:51,115
But that's right in the centre of town.

402
01:04:51,793 --> 01:04:52,805
Will be there,
Colonel.

403
01:05:03,088 --> 01:05:05,448
What the fuck are you.

404
01:05:11,235 --> 01:05:14,250
Everyone, get in the APC.
I'll drive.

405
01:05:19,588 --> 01:05:20,758
Do you think you can
drive that thing?

406
01:05:22,722 --> 01:05:24,586
I will get on the gun.
- Don't miss.

407
01:05:25,578 --> 01:05:26,709
Don't crash.

408
01:05:35,995 --> 01:05:37,423
Hold on.

409
01:07:14,529 --> 01:07:17,365
- Why are we stopping?
- It doesn't make any sense.

410
01:07:17,881 --> 01:07:19,904
Gilliam's Circle is right in the
centre of town.

411
01:07:20,945 --> 01:07:22,690
We will be surrounded
by those things.

412
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:26,481
- Wait a second. Why are you saying?
- I think that the Colonel is lying.

413
01:07:27,618 --> 01:07:29,978
But that is crazy.
The government doesn't never lie to people.

414
01:07:32,485 --> 01:07:36,254
The army thinks about containment first.
They can't risk this getting worse.

415
01:07:36,611 --> 01:07:39,428
Help is a few miles down that road,
and there are waiting for us.

416
01:07:39,917 --> 01:07:41,560
Now if you won't drive us there,
I will.

417
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:44,242
Eddie, if she is right, then the only thing
down that road is more of these things.

418
01:07:44,622 --> 01:07:47,367
- You're not seriously considering this?
- I'm considering whatever keeps us alive.

419
01:07:47,954 --> 01:07:49,640
Which means getting out of this town.

420
01:07:51,152 --> 01:07:53,593
There are only two helicopters in town.
One is at the airport..

421
01:07:53,632 --> 01:07:56,151
- No, that's too far. We'll never make it there.
- The other one is at the hospital.

422
01:07:56,588 --> 01:07:59,165
The people at the hospital probably
used it to get out.

423
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:00,831
That's a chance we have to take.

424
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:04,592
If you have wrong and the helicopter
is gone, we're all dead.

425
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:07,206
If I am right, they'll dead if they follow you.

426
01:08:14,209 --> 01:08:15,855
There's a truck coming.

427
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:29,232
- Dallas, what the hell are you doing in there?
- Never mind that.

428
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:31,314
- You guys heading to the air lift?
- Yeah

429
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:33,634
Ok. Follow us.
We don't have much time.

430
01:08:34,427 --> 01:08:37,802
Alright. Listen up.
Everybody's gotta choose right now.

431
01:08:41,457 --> 01:08:43,421
We're going to the hospital
with the tank.

432
01:08:43,996 --> 01:08:46,218
We all need to go the center of the town.
- That is right.

433
01:08:46,694 --> 01:08:48,327
- I'm going with my brother.
- I'll go along with you.

434
01:08:48,783 --> 01:08:49,993
I'm going in the tank.

435
01:08:51,064 --> 01:08:51,996
Dallas, don't do this.

436
01:08:53,732 --> 01:08:56,227
She's wrong.
And brother or not, he's wrong.

437
01:08:56,794 --> 01:08:58,022
You're gonna get them killed.

438
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,115
We are running out of time, Sheriff,
We gotta move now.

439
01:09:00,353 --> 01:09:02,981
Hold on.
We're coming with you.

440
01:09:07,563 --> 01:09:08,743
Wait.

441
01:09:14,373 --> 01:09:14,908
Take care.

442
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:19,216
I hope we're both wrong.

443
01:09:29,196 --> 01:09:30,062
Lets go.

444
01:09:51,379 --> 01:09:54,811
I didn't help anybody.
I was too scared.

445
01:09:55,842 --> 01:09:57,132
I just watched them die.

446
01:10:09,488 --> 01:10:11,115
All right, put these on.

447
01:10:13,282 --> 01:10:13,798
You too.

448
01:10:41,995 --> 01:10:42,966
All right, listen.

449
01:10:43,135 --> 01:10:47,836
Whatever happens inside, the only person
who can't get hurt is Kelly. We all protect Kelly.

450
01:10:49,492 --> 01:10:52,733
What is this, the Titanic? Screw the
"women and children first shit", man.

451
01:10:52,951 --> 01:10:55,647
Look, asshole, unless you can
fly the helicopter, shut up.

452
01:10:56,046 --> 01:10:57,037
Let's go.

453
01:11:49,319 --> 01:11:50,699
Maybe they are all gone.

454
01:13:35,396 --> 01:13:37,022
Fucking. Shoot it!

455
01:13:43,714 --> 01:13:45,797
- Jesse, no wait.
- Move, now.

456
01:14:51,678 --> 01:14:55,319
Jesse, wait.

457
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:26,908
Ricky, wait.
Motherfucker....

458
01:15:55,557 --> 01:15:56,528
Come on.

459
01:15:58,525 --> 01:15:59,556
Come on, get up.

460
01:16:01,401 --> 01:16:02,849
You're gonna make it. Brother...

461
01:16:08,037 --> 01:16:10,080
We have to go.
Now.

462
01:16:13,734 --> 01:16:15,777
Go. Go. Go. Go.

463
01:16:20,595 --> 01:16:22,976
[Indistinct shouting]

464
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:32,293
Is this everybody?
- This is all that's left.

465
01:16:32,313 --> 01:16:34,693
- What have you heard?
- The air lift will be here soon.

466
01:16:39,909 --> 01:16:40,702
Clear!

467
01:16:43,424 --> 01:16:45,229
- Come. Go go. You're all right?
- Yes.

468
01:16:49,051 --> 01:16:50,420
Come here.

469
01:16:52,324 --> 01:16:54,109
Go go.
Follow your mom.

470
01:16:55,551 --> 01:16:57,674
- Come on.
- Everyone, move.

471
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:00,946
Run Molly.

472
01:17:15,445 --> 01:17:17,071
Dallas.
- I'm trying.

473
01:17:19,344 --> 01:17:22,101
- Are you going to use that thing?
- Hang on.

474
01:17:28,559 --> 01:17:29,868
Lets go.

475
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:38,184
You got her?

476
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:55,917
Colonel Stevens? This is Gunnison County...

477
01:17:55,918 --> 01:17:58,059
Requesting status on your evac,
Over.

478
01:18:04,704 --> 01:18:06,667
Colonel, where's the air lift.

479
01:18:07,718 --> 01:18:11,703
Sheriff, we are still 10 miles out.
Hold your position, over.

480
01:18:13,071 --> 01:18:14,513
Colonel, we're here over.

481
01:18:18,378 --> 01:18:19,786
God help us all.

482
01:18:21,591 --> 01:18:24,090
Alright, get out of here, now.
I will buy us some time.

483
01:18:24,110 --> 01:18:27,068
- I'm not leaving you.
- Get to the chopper.

484
01:18:27,108 --> 01:18:28,576
You don't have to do this, Dallas.

485
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:30,579
Now. Go, go.

486
01:18:32,285 --> 01:18:33,693
Come on, you
Motherfuckers!!!

487
01:18:39,609 --> 01:18:41,116
Come, over here.

488
01:18:54,455 --> 01:18:55,030
Come on.

489
01:19:01,958 --> 01:19:03,228
Okay. Go!

490
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,665
Hey, come on over here!

491
01:20:47,854 --> 01:20:50,393
- We're not leaving without him.
- We have to go.

492
01:20:51,047 --> 01:20:51,860
He will make it.

493
01:20:57,758 --> 01:20:59,127
Die.

494
01:21:21,384 --> 01:21:22,316
Let's go.

495
01:23:59,678 --> 01:24:00,690
Close your eyes.

496
01:24:06,725 --> 01:24:08,312
- Hang on.
- Mommy.

497
01:24:08,331 --> 01:24:08,986
Hang on.

498
01:24:33,781 --> 01:24:38,105
- Hey, you're all right? Ricky?
- Press here, yes, hard.

499
01:24:59,508 --> 01:25:00,619
Drop your weapons.

500
01:25:11,842 --> 01:25:14,777
- You bastards killed the entire town.
- We're just following orders.

501
01:25:15,651 --> 01:25:17,406
Put down your weapons.

502
01:25:39,016 --> 01:25:40,622
We need a medic, for my brother.

503
01:25:42,031 --> 01:25:42,963
Medivac is inbound.

504
01:25:44,287 --> 01:25:47,183
Secure any weapons and lets
set up a perimeter.

505
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:48,591
Go, move it.

506
01:26:11,581 --> 01:26:15,745
I told you not to crash.

507
01:26:19,075 --> 01:26:20,027
Mommy?

508
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,869
Are the monsters' gone?

509
01:26:24,832 --> 01:26:26,935
They are gone.

510
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:21,525
The world isn't ready
for this technology.

511
01:27:23,674 --> 01:27:27,125
But this isn't for our world,
is it Miss Yutani?
