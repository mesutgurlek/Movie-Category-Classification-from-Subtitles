on the Mayflower, on the fire.

do things that we don't want to do?

slit his own throat.

00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,395
<i>Terrence Berry.</i>

472
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,469
<i>Wait one sec.</i>

473
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,950
<i>- I think I got him. You still there?</i>
- Yeah.

474
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,030
<i>- Your guy murdered his whole family.</i>
- I already know that.

475
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,439
<i>He's dead.</i>

476
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,958
(SIGHING) Damn it.

477
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,599
Can you tell me where he was committed
before he died?

478
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,551
DR. MORRIS: You know, Mr. Carson, when
one starts to perceive one's own reflection

479
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,437
as a completely separate being,

480
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,557
one is suddenly confronted
with two entirely separate egos,

481
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,189
two entirely separate worlds
that can surface at any given moment.

482
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,397
A feeling of self-hatred,
usually triggered by a psychological shock

483
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,232
can split the personality in two.

484
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,471
Hence creating two or more personalities
with distinct memories

485
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,996
and distinct behavior patterns
within the same individual.

486
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,278
The patient then has
the false perception of the existence

487
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,433
of two distinct worlds, the real world
and the world inside a mirror.

488
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,640
These recordings were used
in Terrence's trial.

489
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,597
You'll see they speak for themselves.

490
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,597
<i>DOCTOR: Why did you set</i>
<i>the department store on fire?</i>

491
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,672
<i>In order to destroy the mirrors.</i>

492
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,950
<i>Only fire can destroy mirrors,</i>
<i>isn't that right, Doctor?</i>

493
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,473
<i>DOCTOR:</i>
<i>What made you think you absolutely</i>

494
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,358
<i>had to destroy those mirrors, Terrence?</i>

495
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:31,550
<i>They killed my Helen</i>
<i>and my three children.</i>

496
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,639
<i>DOCTOR: For what reason?</i>

497
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,039
<i>Why would mirrors</i>
<i>want to kill your family?</i>

498
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,714
<i>- Because I didn't...</i>
<i>- DOCTOR: Didn't do what?</i>

499
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,712
<i>They asked me to find Esseker.</i>

500
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,789
Oh, my God.

501
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,552
<i>We all are looking for Esseker.</i>

502
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,232
Amy.

503
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,311
Excuse me, I have to go.

504
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:54,037
<i>DOCTOR: Tell me about Esseker, Terrence.</i>
<i>Who is Esseker?</i>

505
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,634
<i>I don't know who Esseker is!</i>

506
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,200
<i>I don't know who Esseker is!</i>

507
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,034
<i>I don't know.</i>

508
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,036
ROSA: Mrs. Carson? It's Rosa.

509
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,356
(WHISPERING) Mr. Ben is here.
He's moving all of the furniture around.

510
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,913
- Hey. How was school today?
- Good.

511
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,150
Good. I'll be right back.

512
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,269
Dad...

513
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,830
BEN: Sweetheart, just give me a second.
I gotta take care of a couple of things.

514
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,431
Daddy, what are you doing?

515
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,395
Honey, don't look scared.
Everything's fine.

516
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,233
I think it looks nicer like this. Don't you?

517
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,031
AMY: Rosa, what's happening?

518
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,392
Take the kids downstairs, right now.
Right now.

519
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,955
What the hell are you doing?

520
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,156
Amy, you're gonna have to trust me.
This is for your own protection.

521
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,470
Get out of the house, right now!

522
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,512
Hey, are you listening to me?
You are scaring the kids!

523
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,033
If you don't leave immediately,
I'm calling the police,

524
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,997
and I warn you,
you will never see your kids again!

525
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,310
Amy, I am not crazy.
These mirrors are dangerous.

526
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,278
At first I thought it was just the ones
in the store, but after Angela was killed,

527
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,554
I realized they can get at you anywhere.

528
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,394
I promise I will leave the house.
Just let me cover these damn mirrors.

529
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,311
What's wrong with you?

530
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,516
I know what you've been going through
hasn't been easy.

531
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,036
But guess what?
It hasn't been easy for us, either!

532
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,953
Angela was a part of our lives, too,
you know that?

533
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,759
It's not fair what you're doing to us, Ben!

534
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,435
Michael... He's acting so strange now.

535
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,354
He always wants to be alone. He won't
talk to me. He's having nightmares.

536
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,193
Ben, your behavior is rubbing off on him!

537
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,078
He is six years old. I have to protect him!

538
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,430
I want to show you something.
