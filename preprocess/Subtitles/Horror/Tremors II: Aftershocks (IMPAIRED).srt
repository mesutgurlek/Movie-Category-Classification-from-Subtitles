[Passenger] This is beautiful

I had great difficulty finding
you, but I'm glad I did.

35
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:47,122
You see, we have had to close down
one of Mexico's biggest oil fields.

have been killed.

You mean...
there's more of them?

Yes. The company is facing
very expensive delays.

44
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:21,740

there are many isolated people

Freeze-dried, foil sealed.

510
00:40:16,816 --> 00:40:20,612
It's got to be foil. Plastic

Yeah, everybody should have
been here a long time ago.

I don't like this.
This is not good.

771
01:01:22,707 --> 01:01:25,126
Okay, stay here
with the seismos.

772
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:27,546
I'm going to go look for them
right now.

What are they?

We don't know.
The worms change somehow.

They-- They--

01:02:35,155 --> 01:02:38,408
- I know. I know.
- We got them, though.
We just blew 'em away?

789
01:02:40,702 --> 01:02:44,039
No. They jumped his truck.

Did he get back?

No. I tried to call him. I tried you.
The radio-- Uh, excuse me.

793
01:02:56,718 --> 01:02:59,971
But I think
we should get goin'.

Uh-huh. Yeah.

[Growls]

799
01:03:24,913 --> 01:03:30,126
They wrecked our car,
Pedro's truck, the radio tower.
How can they be so smart?

800
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,420
Let's get
our butts inside.

801

[Grady]
What the hell
we gonna do?

802
01:03:36,716 --> 01:03:40,804
Get these windows shut!
It's like they got
the whole thing planned.

803
01:03:40,887 --> 01:03:44,975
Grady! Grady! Come on!
All right. How many
do you think there are?

804
01:03:45,058 --> 01:03:46,977
All right,
I remember. I remember.

805
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:50,939
There was three big sacks,
or bags, in that one
we saw split open.

806
01:03:51,022 --> 01:03:55,068
Huh, Earl? Can't be more
than three of those things
in each worm.

807
01:03:55,151 --> 01:03:57,445
Yeah, I-- I--
That's right, I guess.

808
01:03:57,529 --> 01:04:00,282
Kate, how many big worms
were left out there?

809
01:04:00,365 --> 01:04:03,660
You killed all but eight
graboids. I was watching.

810
01:04:03,743 --> 01:04:07,581
So if all eight of them changed,
that would make, uh--

811
01:04:07,664 --> 01:04:09,708
Twenty-four!
Twenty-four
of those things left!

812
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:12,544
How many have you killed?
Well, let's see--

813
01:04:12,627 --> 01:04:16,214
We, uh-- We killed
one on the radio tower
and-- and one out there...

814
01:04:16,298 --> 01:04:19,050
and, um, on top of the car.

815
01:04:19,134 --> 01:04:22,637
That's it?
Well, I'm sorry.

816
01:04:22,721 --> 01:04:26,266
No. It's just that I mean--
[Rumbling]

Oh, man!
Now what?

Thank God, it's Burt.

01:04:35,609 --> 01:04:38,028
Yes!
They didn't get him.

820
01:04:52,959 --> 01:04:54,878
I think they did get him.

826
01:05:20,946 --> 01:05:24,324
I feel I was denied...

827
01:05:24,407 --> 01:05:29,871
critical, need-to-know
information.

828
01:05:31,248 --> 01:05:33,166
Well, we're sorry, Burt.

829
01:05:34,876 --> 01:05:37,295
They just changed
all of a sudden, man.

830
01:05:37,379 --> 01:05:41,675
We would have warned you,
but they knocked out
the radio tower.

831
01:05:43,176 --> 01:05:45,095
Come on, Burt!
What happened?

832
01:05:45,178 --> 01:05:48,890
Well, when the radios
went out,

833
01:05:48,974 --> 01:05:51,476
I decided to return
to the refiney.

834
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:56,856
But en route, I find
I'm in an ambush situation.

835
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:59,568
Must have been a couple
of dozen of these things!

836
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:05,282
I dropped the first wave
with semiauto fire,
but they just kept coming.

837
01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:10,287
Most were in front of the truck,
so I popped it in six-wheel
and ran 'em down.

838
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:13,415
The ones that got on board,
I handled with a combination...

839
01:06:13,498 --> 01:06:16,835
of small arms fire
and hand-to-hand techniques.

840
01:06:20,547 --> 01:06:24,467
I am completely out of ammo.

841
01:06:29,848 --> 01:06:31,766
That's never
happened to me before.

842
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:34,811
Well, shit!
Who cares, Burt?

843
01:06:34,895 --> 01:06:37,480
Sounds like you
killed 'em all, huh?

844
01:06:37,564 --> 01:06:40,984
I hope not.
These creatures
are very important.

You know,
I mean scientifically.

846
01:06:46,531 --> 01:06:48,783
That fact was
not lost on me.

847

When it was all over,
I saw one of the little

It doesn't hear us;
it doesn't actually see us;

872
01:09:21,144 --> 01:09:24,231
it senses the heat
of our bodies.

must be the heat sensor.

The sound doesn't matter.

882
01:10:01,268 --> 01:10:05,230
They make noise,
but they signal each other
with their body heat.

883
01:10:05,313 --> 01:10:09,192
It only sees heat?
Yes, that's not so weird.

884
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:11,695
A rattlesnake
strikes at body heat.

885
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,075
That's why
they tore up the cars--
because the engines were hot.

886
01:10:17,158 --> 01:10:19,703
They thought it was food.

887
01:10:19,786 --> 01:10:22,205
[Kate]
And the same thing
with the radio tower.

888
01:10:22,289 --> 01:10:24,916
That electronic gear
puts off all kinds of heat.

889
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,711
So basically, they bite
anything that's warm.

890
01:10:27,794 --> 01:10:30,505
They been actin' so smart
'cause they're so stupid?

How does he know to eat that?

892
01:10:46,938 --> 01:10:49,399
Well, it tastes it
with its tongue.

893

Hey, it was my food!

909
01:12:20,448 --> 01:12:24,703
Whenever one of them gets
enough food, they just bla-a-ah,
and there's another one.

910
01:12:24,786 --> 01:12:27,789
Then one makes two,
two makes four,

911
01:12:27,873 --> 01:12:30,000
four makes eight--
It's exponential.

912

Well, uh, hell.
That gives 'em quite an edge.

01:13:05,952 --> 01:13:07,871
Go! Go!

925
01:13:07,954 --> 01:13:10,582
Yeah! Yeah!

926
01:13:10,665 --> 01:13:13,335
[Kate]
The warehouse! We
gotta close the warehouse!

927

- [Kate]
oh! oh!
- [Screaming]

928
01:13:16,963 --> 01:13:19,674
This way!
Grady! No!

929
01:13:19,758 --> 01:13:22,761
No! Not that way!
Grady!

930
01:13:24,137 --> 01:13:26,389
Grady, damn it!

931
01:13:26,473 --> 01:13:29,768
[Earl]
All right! All right!
This isn't gonna work.

932
01:13:29,851 --> 01:13:32,395
[Guys]
Shit!

933
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:35,398
[Growling]

934
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:47,577
[Panting]
They stopped.

935
01:13:47,661 --> 01:13:50,956
They're just milling around.

936
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:53,833
Looks like they
lost track of us.
That's not gonna last.

937
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:58,547
We're like
sittin' ducks here!

938
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,091
Well, it looked like
a goddam building!

939
01:14:01,174 --> 01:14:05,762
Why didn't you listen to me?
These little snappers
are blind and deaf.

940
01:14:05,845 --> 01:14:07,889
We've gotta
be able to beat them.

01:14:21,778 --> 01:14:23,697
[Growling]

942
01:14:34,207 --> 01:14:37,627
I told ya,
they can't see us.

943
01:14:37,711 --> 01:14:40,839
Great, now what?
Now, move with me.

944
01:14:40,922 --> 01:14:43,133
Move?

945
01:14:43,216 --> 01:14:46,511
It's gonna work, damn it.
Now move! And step, and step,

946
01:14:46,595 --> 01:14:51,391
and step and step--
I don't know how you
come up with this shit.

947
01:14:51,474 --> 01:14:53,977
I think on my feet.

948
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,979
Come on! It's working.

949
01:14:56,062 --> 01:15:00,108
Comin' at ya.
Okay. All right.

950
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:02,569
And down.

951
01:15:13,163 --> 01:15:16,333
So...

952
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:19,127
where are we going?

953
01:15:20,587 --> 01:15:22,505
Are there
any more cars left?

954
01:15:22,589 --> 01:15:24,674
Um, uh, yeah.

955
01:15:24,758 --> 01:15:28,803
One. Julio's.
It's by the storage tank.

956
01:15:28,887 --> 01:15:32,057
- Which way?
- Left. Move left.

957
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:36,436
Okay. Ready and moving left,

958
01:15:36,519 --> 01:15:41,191
and step, and step, and step,

959
01:15:41,274 --> 01:15:43,985
and step and step.

960
01:15:49,324 --> 01:15:51,284
Okay, it's
not much further.

961
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:55,288
oh!

962
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:59,459
[Kate]
There's one
of them out there!

963
01:15:59,543 --> 01:16:02,462
Oh, shit!
Did it see you?

964
01:16:02,546 --> 01:16:06,675
Well, if it had, I think
we'd be hearing about it by now.

965
01:16:06,758 --> 01:16:08,677
How far is it?

966
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,304
Uh, uh, 100 yards about.

967
01:16:11,388 --> 01:16:14,266
[Earl]
That's a heck of a shot.

968
01:16:14,349 --> 01:16:16,560
Uh-huh.

969
01:16:16,643 --> 01:16:19,729
Whoa! You got
only one shot?
Then you gotta hit it...

970
01:16:19,813 --> 01:16:24,401
before it sends one of those
heat signals to the others.

971
01:16:24,484 --> 01:16:26,653
I know.

What?

984
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:37,265
I didn't know.
How could I've known?

985
01:17:39,392 --> 01:17:43,480
We're supposed to be
up against graboids!
I wanted maximum penetration.

01:17:43,563 --> 01:17:45,815
- Well, you've got it.

Now what?

987
01:17:45,899 --> 01:17:49,069
[Earl]
We can't stay here.
We've got to get inside.

got a plan, I think!

We're gonna head for those
oil towers and climb.

01:20:44,744 --> 01:20:47,581
Yes! Earl,
you're a genius.

1019
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:52,836
Come on!
It's clear. Hurry.

1020
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:58,967
You're okay.
They can't climb.

1021
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:01,386
Watch your shin.
Oh, man!

1022
01:21:01,469 --> 01:21:04,890
They can't climb.
Pretty slick, my man.

1023
01:21:04,973 --> 01:21:07,225
Slick?
That was brilliant.

1024
01:21:07,309 --> 01:21:09,519
You really do think
on your feet, don't you?

1025
01:21:09,603 --> 01:21:11,521
Yeah, well.

1026
01:21:12,772 --> 01:21:14,691
Hey, where's Burt?

1027
01:21:14,774 --> 01:21:18,820
Oh, over here.
And don't worry, they can't
even find him in there.

1028
01:21:18,904 --> 01:21:21,865
Oh, man.
I think he's gonna
be okay for now.

Oh, I'm just dandy!

1031
01:21:30,165 --> 01:21:32,500
So what do we do now?

1032
01:21:35,921 --> 01:21:38,215
Hey, Burt!

1033
01:21:38,298 --> 01:21:42,302
Are you sure you don't
have any more bullets?
Did you check all your pockets?

1034
01:21:44,387 --> 01:21:50,060
You know, as I lie here,
I can't help but comment:

1035
01:21:50,143 --> 01:21:55,106
The reason I am out
of nine millimetre rounds
is I was not properly briefed.

1036
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:59,694
And the reason
for that is this mission
was not properly researched.

1037
01:21:59,778 --> 01:22:03,657
If certain people had bothered
to gather intelligence
on the creatures...

1038
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:06,076
before bumbling
into the situation--

1039
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:09,371
Knock it off, Burt!
Nobody made you come.

1040
01:22:09,454 --> 01:22:14,334
when we should be packing
full-auto, preferably belt-fed!

1041
01:22:14,417 --> 01:22:17,379
[Snorting]
Shut up!

1042
01:22:17,462 --> 01:22:23,051
They're Precambrian life forms.
How's anybody supposed to
research Precambrian life?

1043
01:22:23,134 --> 01:22:25,595
What difference
does it make now?

1044
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:29,558
We're stuck on a goddam roof
with a bunch of whatsits
tying to eat us.

1045
01:22:29,641 --> 01:22:32,435
I've done this before,
and I did not like it.

1046
01:22:32,519 --> 01:22:37,148
Okay. It's all my fault!
So things didn't work out
exactly the way we planned.

1047
01:22:37,232 --> 01:22:39,401
If I had the right tools,
I'd finish the job!

1048
01:22:39,484 --> 01:22:42,988
Jeez! Would you
just all relax?

1049
01:22:43,071 --> 01:22:48,118
Now, look. Nobody's
heard from us since last night,

1050
01:22:48,201 --> 01:22:52,956
which means pretty soon
they're going to be up here
looking for us, right?

1051
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:58,378
So all we have to do
is sit and wait. Okay?

1052
01:23:02,132 --> 01:23:04,092
Burt?

1053
01:23:04,175 --> 01:23:05,927
[Growling]

1054
01:23:07,304 --> 01:23:09,222
Okay.

some Spanish, and six months in
Mexico would be an adventure.

01:23:41,254 --> 01:23:43,215
[Laughs]

01:23:46,092 --> 01:23:49,095
So, uh--
[Sighs]

1061
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:52,098
Seeing anybody?

1062
01:23:57,896 --> 01:24:01,066
Not since
the monsters arrived.

[Exhales]
Well, you know, you...

1064
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:09,199
spend a couple of days
almost getting killed,
you start, uh,

1065
01:24:09,282 --> 01:24:11,493
thinking about your future
and--

1066
01:24:11,576 --> 01:24:14,412
Thinking you
should date more?

1067
01:24:14,496 --> 01:24:17,123
Well, uh,
yeah, actually.

[Both Laugh]

1069
01:24:19,209 --> 01:24:22,045
Uh, look, uh,

1070
01:24:22,128 --> 01:24:26,049
I just don't meet that many
women who can keep their cool...

1071
01:24:26,132 --> 01:24:28,176
in a situation like this.

1072
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:35,100
What I mean is that, uh--
What matters to me is that
a woman can handle herself.

1073
01:24:35,183 --> 01:24:37,185
It's much more important
than what she looks like.

1074
01:24:37,269 --> 01:24:41,147
Thanks a lot. Aw, come on!
You look great.

1075
01:24:42,482 --> 01:24:46,069
Enough guys have told you that.
Yeah, well.

1076
01:24:46,152 --> 01:24:49,072
Believe it or not, I made my living
as a model once upon a time.

1077
01:24:49,155 --> 01:24:51,074
I put myself
through college.

1078
01:24:51,157 --> 01:24:53,243
I believe it.
I was a--

1079
