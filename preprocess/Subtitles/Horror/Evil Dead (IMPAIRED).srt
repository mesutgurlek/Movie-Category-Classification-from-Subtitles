You're going to die here,
you pathetic junkie!

843
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,725
I've had enough
of this shit.

(MIA SCREAMING)

845
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:58,002
I will feast on your soul.

846
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,287
Feast on this, motherfucker!

847

(SIGHS)

851
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,090
PROFESSOR KNOWBY: I believe I
have made a significant find

852
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,049
in the Candarian Ruins...

853
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,680
a volume of ancient
Sumerian burial practices

854
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,808
and funerary incantations.

855
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:42,483
It is entitled
"Naturom Demonto."

856
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:45,211
Roughly translated,
"Book of the Dead."

857
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:49,405
The book is bound in human flesh
and inked in human blood.

858
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:53,008
It deals with demons,
demon resurrection...

859
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,089
those forces
which roam the forest

860
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,163
and dark bowers
of man's domain.

861
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:01,169
The first few pages warn that
these enduring creatures...

862
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:04,324
may lie dormant
but are never truly dead.

863
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:06,763
They may be recalled
to active life

864
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,360
through the incantations
presented in this book.

865
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,091
It is through recitation
of these passages

866
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:13,525
that the demons
are given license...

867
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,168
to possess the living.

868
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:52,285
I have seen the dark shadows
moving in the woods...

869
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:55,046
and I have no doubt that
whatever I have resurrected

870
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,326
through this book...

871
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:59,768
is sure to come
calling for me.
