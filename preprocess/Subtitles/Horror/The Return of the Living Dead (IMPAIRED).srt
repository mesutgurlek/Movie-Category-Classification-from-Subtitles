00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:24,025
Hey, Frank! Let's
wrap it up and go home.

3
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:25,359
What do you say?

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,445
Well, I got another
hour's work to do.

5
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:30,030
The kid's gonna stick with me,
and then I'll show him the ropes.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,949
Okay. You lock up for
me before you go?

7
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,410
4th of July weekend, buddy boy.
Got to move.

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,579
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Well, you have a nice 4th,

9
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,748
and I'll see you Sunday
at the barbecue.

10
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:41,500
You'd better believe it.
I'll be there with bells on.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,670
Kid, I wanna tell you something,
and I mean this sincerely.

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,798
No matter what happens,
don't name it after me.

13
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,258
[Laughs]

14
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,594
Take it easy, Frank.

15
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,638
That Burt's a joker.

16
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,557
Okay, Freddy, follow me
and learn something.

17
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,225
Okay.

18
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,770
We got an order here from the St.
Louis University Medical School.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,939
They want two adult female
skeletons with perfect teeth.

20
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,734
That's a 2-AF-PT.

21
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,736
Okay? So you come over
here to the "A" section.

22
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,905
- That's "A" for adult, see?
- Okay.

23
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,199
Then that's divided up
into two sections.

24
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:15,951
That's divided into the "M"
for male and the "F" for...

25
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,870
- Female.
- Good boy.

26
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,538
Now the "PT."

27
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,374
Suppose you think that's
"pretty tough", but no, that's...

28
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,211
- Perfect teeth.
- Very good.

29
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:28,005
Now you get some excelsior over
there and lay it in that crate.

30
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:31,133
Make a nice little beddy-bye
for this little lady.

31
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,135
Okay.

32
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,555
Good work. We want
her to be comfortable.

33
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:38,682
Now help me get her in.
Grab her legs.

34
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,226
Okay.

35
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:43,562
Now you get some of
that styrofoam popcorn,

36
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,898
spread it all around.

37
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:49,109
Don't be stingy.
Uncle Burt's paying for this.

38
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,029
More, Freddy, more.
Okay, that's fine.

39
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,865
Now spread it around.
That's right.

40
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,535
- You're doing very nice work.
- Thanks.

41
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:59,578
You're gonna be fine in the
warehouse business.

42
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,372
Where do we get all
these skeletons from?

43
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:03,916
- Oh, they come from India.
- India?

44
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,836
International treaty.
All skeletons come from India.

45
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:08,254
No kidding. How come?

46
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:09,880
How the hell do I know "how come"?

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,799
The important question is,

48
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,134
where do they get all the
skeletons with perfect teeth?

49
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,136
I'm going to ask you a
serious question.

50
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,305
How many people you know die

51
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,767
with a beautiful, perfect set
of choppers in their puss, huh?

52
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,435
Nobody I can think of.

53
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,772
No. I think that there's a
skeleton farm over in India.

54
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,983
[Laughs]
Jesus!

55
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:32,278
Come on, kid.
Follow your uncle here.

56
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:33,904
Here we go.

57
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,865
I don't have to tell
you what these are for.

58
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:37,283
Ba ba ba boom!

59
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,453
Here we've got the prosthetic
devices, all around here.

60
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,664
Look under there. Wheelchairs.

61
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,583
Right. These are great.

62
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,084
Here's something you
don't see very often.

63
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,128
You're a privileged person.

64
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:52,756
These are split dogs.
Yep, for veterinarian schools.

65
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,675
Oh, we get a lot of
orders for split dogs.

66
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:55,843
- That's really rad.
- Yeah.

67
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,888
- [Growls]
- Don't fool around, you're learning.

68
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:02,892
Over here, Freddy, is where
we keep the fresh cadavers.

69
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,810
We sell these to medical schools

70
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,396
and to the U.S. Army
for ballistic tests.

71
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,279
Well, say hello.

72
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,624
We usually got
more inventory than this,

73
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,543
but, ah, we're expecting
a shipment on Monday.

74
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,089
H-how many bodies are in here usually?

75
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,258
Well, you know, you don't
want to be overstocked.

76
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,177
Kind of like the restaurant business,

77
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,597
you don't want your inventory
to lose its freshness.

78
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,642

79
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,268
Tell you what I'll do, kid.

80
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,479
Teach you how to fill
out these shipping forms.

81
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,107
Look alive.

82
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:59,990
- We gonna party tonight or what?
- Yeah, we are gonna party.

83
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,450
Well, where?
Where we gonna party?

84
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,161
- I don't know. Somewhere.
- Hey, we could go to the park.

85
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,248
Oh, no, we can't. The cops will
shoot us if we go back to the park.

86
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,874
And I ain't in no mood to die tonight.

87
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,417
I like death.

88
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,253
I like death with sex.
How 'bout you, Casey?

89
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,546
- You like sex with death?
- Yeah, so fuck off and die.

90
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,131
So, when we gonna
party tonight, Tina?

91
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,257
Oh you guys,
that'd be really rad,

92
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,134
but I'm supposed to meet Freddy
when he gets off work.

93
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,844
Yeah, where you
supposed to meet him?

94
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,513
At this medical supply warehouse
where he's working.

95
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,848
Oh, no, he got a job?
What a dick.

96
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,558
Shit, why didn't you say so?

97
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,644
Why don't we all go pick Freddy up?

98
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,771
Freddy always knows where
there's a place to party.

99

Yeah, kid?

What's the weirdest thing
you ever saw in here?

102
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,998
Oh, kid,

103
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,375
I have seen weird things come,

104
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,169
and I have seen weird things go.

105
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,422
But the weirdest thing I ever saw

106
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,590
just had to cap it all.

107
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,260
Oh, yeah? What's that?

108
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,262
Let me ask you a question, kid.

109
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:09,059
Did you see that movie,
Night of the Living Dead?

110
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,020
Yeah, yeah, that's the
one where the corpses

111
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,312
start eating the people, right?

112
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,565
Sure. Wh-what about it?

113
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:18,152
Did you know that movie
was based on a true case?

114
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,696
Come on, you're shitting me, right?

115
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,240
I've never been more serious in my life.

116
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,659
That's not possible.

117
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,495
I mean, they showed
zombies taking over the world.

118
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,541
They changed it all around.
What really happened was

119
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,628
back in 1969, in Pittsburgh,
at the V.A. hospital,

120
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,797
there was a chemical spill

121
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,216
and all that stuff

122
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,053
kinda leaked down into the morgue

123
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,305
and it made all the dead bodies

124
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,474
kinda jump around as
though it was alive.

125
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,017
What chemical?

126
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,978
2-4-5-Trioxin,
it's called.

127
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,357
It was to kinda spray on
marijuana or something.

128
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,484
And the Darrow Chemical Company

129
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,652
was trying to develop it
for the Army.

130
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:04,239
And they told the guy who
made the movie

131
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:08,327
that if he told the true story,
they'd just sue his ass off.

132
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:11,663
So he changed all the
facts around.

133
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,999
So what really happened?

134
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,127
Well, they closed it all down, see,

135
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,839
and the Army shipped all
that contaminated dirt

136
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,926
and all those dead bodies out.

137
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,762
And they kept it a secret. Shh.

138
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,098
What...

139
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,683
So how come you know about it?

140
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,812
A typical Army fuck up.

141
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:38,565
The Transportation Department
got the orders crossed,

142
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:43,320
and they shipped those bodies here

143
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,281
instead of to the
Darrow Chemical Company.
