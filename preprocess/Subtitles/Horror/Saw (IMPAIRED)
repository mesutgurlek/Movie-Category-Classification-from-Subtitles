1
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,430
(Water trickling)

2
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,340
(Gasping and coughing)

3
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,630
(Groaning)

4
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,070
Help! Someone help me!

5
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,190
Is someone there?

6
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,190
Hey!

7
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,350
Oh, shit, I'm probably dead.

8
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,030
MAN: <i>You're not dead.</i>
- Who's that?

9
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,030
Who's that?

10
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,710
<i>There's no point in yelling, I already tried that.</i>

11
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,950
Turn on the lights!

12
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,150
<i>I would if I could.</i>

13
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,390
What the fuck is going on? Where am I?

14
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,870
- <i>I don't know yet.</i>
- What is that smell?

15
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,950
<i>Shh. Hang on a second.</i>
<i>I think I found something.</i>

16
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,190
(Groans)

17
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,270
Holy shit.

18
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,030
(Vomits)

19
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,230
Aaaargh! Help!

20
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,910
Help!

21
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,310
<i>Help!</i>

22
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,870
Help!

23
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,870
No-one can hear you.

24
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,070
What the fuck is this?

25
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,670
- Calm down. Just calm down.
- (Breathes heavily)

26
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,900
Are you hurt?

27
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,190
I don't know. Yeah!

28
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,750
- What's your name?
- My name is Very Fucking Confused.

29
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,350
What's <i>your</i> name? What's going on here?

30
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,220
My name is Lawrence Gordon, I'm a doctor.
I just woke up here, like you.

31
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,950
Aaaargh!

32
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,430
<i>Recognize him?</i>

33
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,070
No.

34
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,790
Do you have any idea how you got here?

35
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,550
No.

36
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,390
- What's the last thing you remember?
- Nothing.

37
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,670
I went to bed in my shit-hole apartment,
and woke up in an actual shit-hole.

38
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,860
What about you, huh?

39
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,310
There's... There's not much to tell.

40
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,630
<i>I was on my way home from work, and...</i>

41
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,670
I don't remember anything else.

42
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,230
First dead body I've ever seen.

43
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,950
<i>They look different in real life.</i>

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,950
They don't move.

45
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,270
From the looks of these chains,

46
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,990
someone didn't want <i>us</i> to go very far, either.

47
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,190
- Can you see any scars?
- What?

48
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,990
Man, they kidnap you and drug you.

49
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,870
Before you know, you're in a bath
and your kidneys are on eBay.

50
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,470
No-one has taken your kidneys.

51
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,150
How can you tell from way over there?

52
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,430
You'd either be in terrible agony,
or you'd be dead by now.

53
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,830
Trust me.

54
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,870
- What are you, a surgeon?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

55
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,110
So...

56
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,060
Are you gonna tell me
your name, or what?

57
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,350
Adam.

58
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,430
Well, Adam...

59
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,150
What we need to do...

60
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,470
is start thinking about why we're here.

61
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,950
<i>Whoever brought us here</i>
<i>could have killed us by now.</i>

62
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,260
<i>But they didn't.</i>

63
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,110
They must want something from us.

64
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,910
The question is, what?

65
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,430
- <i>That clock.</i>
- <i>What about it?</i>

66
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,350
- It's brand-new.
- So?

67
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,190
So...somebody obviously
wanted us to know the time.

68
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,750
<i>Wait, I think I might be able to reach the door.</i>

69
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,790
(Grunting)

70
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,550
What is that?

71
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,140
Excuse me.

72
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,110
It's a tape.

73
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,990
- Where did you find it?
- It was in my pocket.

74
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,910
<i>It says, "Play me."</i>

75
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,070
Come on. Come on.

76
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,510
<i>Throw it over here.</i>

77
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,270
Fuck.

78
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,420
No?

79
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,990
(Key clatters to the floor)

80
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,070
(Strains)

81
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,750
- Use your shirt.
- What?

82
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,790
<i>Your shirt.</i>

83
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,990
(Groans) <i>Come on.</i>

84
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,830
- It won't work.
- Look around.

85
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,870
There must be something else you can use.

86
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,550
- There's nothing.
- Well, there must be something.

87
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,990
<i>Come on. You can do it.</i>

88
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,740
Come on. Come on.

89
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,060
<i>Again.</i>

90
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,110
SINISTER VOICE: <i>Rise and shine, Adam.</i>

91
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,550
<i>You're probably wondering where you are.</i>

92
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,020
<i>I'll tell you where you might be.</i>

93
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,870
<i>You might be in the room that you die in.</i>

94
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,630
<i>Up until now, you've simply sat in the shadows,</i>
<i>watching others live out their lives.</i>

95
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,830
<i>But what do voyeurs see</i>
<i>when they look into the mirror?</i>

96
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,310
<i>Now, I see you as a strange mix</i>
<i>of someone angry yet apathetic.</i>

97
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,310
<i>But mostly just pathetic.</i>

98
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,430
<i>So, are you going to watch</i>
<i>yourself die today, Adam,</i>

99
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,470
<i>or do something about it?</i>

100
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,830
I don't get it.

101
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,870
Throw me the player.

102
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,870
No. You throw me your tape.

103
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,780
Look, we're gonna have to work together,
if we want to get out of here.

104
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,230
- <i>Throw it to me.</i>
- I'm not gonna risk breaking it.

105
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,270
<i>You throw me your tape.</i>

106
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,710
(Groans)

107
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,390
SINISTER VOICE: <i>Dr. Gordon...</i>

108
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,860
<i>this is your wake-up call.</i>

109
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,630
<i>Every day of your working life,</i>
<i>you have given people the news</i>

110
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,990
<i>that they're gonna die soon.</i>

111
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,750
<i>Now you will be the cause of death.</i>

112
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,590
<i>Your aim in this game is to kill Adam.</i>

113
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,670
<i>You have until 6 on the clock to do it.</i>

114
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,380
<i>There's a man in the room with you.</i>

115
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,940
<i>When there's that much poison in your blood,</i>

116
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,470
<i>the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.</i>

117
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,670
<i>(Coughing)</i>

118
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,470
<i>There are ways to win this,</i>
<i>hidden all around you.</i>

119
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,680
<i>Just remember,</i>
<i>X marks the spot for the treasure.</i>

120
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,510
<i>If you do not kill Adam by six,</i>

121
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,190
<i>then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon.</i>

122
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,430
<i>And I'll leave you in this room to rot.</i>

123
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,630
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

124
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,070
(Click)

125
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,630
Give me that.

126
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,780
Now.

127
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,910
(Rewinds)

128
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,710
<i>Then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon...</i>

129
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,510
<i>...and I'll leave you in this room to rot.</i>

130
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,540
- Any idea who that is?
- <i>Let the game begin.</i>

131
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,150
- He knows us.
- Wait a minute.

132
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,190
What do you think? Probably a joke, right?

133
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,710
Shh!

134
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,910
- <i>Let the game begin.</i>
- Listen. Listen.

135
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,870
(Whispered) <i>Follow your heart.</i>

136
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,180
(Static)

137
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,830
(Turns off tape)

138
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,470
<i>What the hell does "follow your heart" mean?</i>

139
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,870
There, right next to you, on the toilet.

140
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,950
Come on. Come on.

141
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,430
Oh, man!

142
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,110
(Groans)

143
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,510
(Gasps)

144
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,910
(Spits)

145
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,630
- Anything?
- No solids.

146
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,990
Take off the lid.

147
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,990
<i>Come on.</i>

148
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,630
I really wish I had've checked in there first.

149
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,790
Huh! What is it?

150
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,710
Hey.

151
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,670
Mind passing me the other one?

152
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,590
Fuck! Fuck!

153
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,430
(Panting)

154
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,740
He doesn't want us to cut through our chains.

155
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,470
He wants us to cut through our feet.

156
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,430
I think I may know who's done this to us.

157
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,820
What did you say?

158
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,870
Well, it's not someone I know personally.

159
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,310
It's just someone I know of.

160
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,710
<i>Jesus Christ! Tell me. Who is it?</i>

161
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,030
Last I heard...

162
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,760
..the police still hadn't caught him.

163
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,070
<i>And the only reason I know that...</i>

164
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,110
<i>is because I was a suspect.</i>

165
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,390
<i>I'll start from the beginning.</i>

166
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,910
(Flies buzzing)

167
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,190
This one's not fresh any more.
At least three weeks out.

168
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,390
<i>Victim's a 46-year-old male.</i>

169
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,350
<i>Died of massive blood loss,</i>
<i>mostly through the femoral artery.</i>

170
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,190
He started at the back and tunneled
through that razor wire so fast,

171
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,230
it's amazing he got as far as he did.

172
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,190
<i>Cut himself so deep,</i>
<i>we found traces of stomach acid on the floor.</i>

173
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,470
We also found this.

174
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,670
(Click)

175
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,910
SINISTER VOICE: <i>Hello, Paul. You are a</i>
<i>perfectly healthy, sane, middle-class male,</i>

176
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,270
<i>yet last month,</i>

177
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,920
<i>you ran a straight razor across your wrists.</i>

178
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,590
<i>Did you cut yourself</i>
<i>because you truly wanted to die,</i>

179
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,190
<i>or did you just want some attention?</i>

180
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,710
<i>Tonight, you'll show me.</i>

181
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,630
<i>The irony is that if you want to die,</i>

182
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,020
<i>you just have to stay where you are.</i>

183
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,580
<i>If you want to live,</i>
<i>you'll have to cut yourself again.</i>

184
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,710
<i>Find a path through the razor wire to the door.</i>

185
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,070
<i>But hurry.</i>

186
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,990
<i>At three o'clock that door will lock.</i>

187
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,460
<i>And then this room becomes your tomb.</i>

188
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,750
<i>How much blood will you shed</i>
<i>to stay alive, Paul?</i>

189
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,950
(Screams)

190
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,470
Door was on a timer.
It was unlocked until three o'clock.

191
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,150
Then it slammed shut. He was given two hours.

192
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,430
(Screaming)

193
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,550
You sick fuck!

194
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,750
<i>A jigsaw piece.</i>

195
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,350
(Camera whirs)

196
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,150
I think we're gonna be here for a while, Sing.

197
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,780
LAWRENCE: <i>The newspapers started</i>
<i>calling him "the jigsaw killer".</i>

198
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,070
Actually, technically speaking,

199
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,550
he's...not really a murderer.

200
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,990
He never killed anyone.

201
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,990
<i>He finds ways for his victims</i>
<i>to kill themselves.</i>

202
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,630
SINISTER VOICE ON TAPE:
<i>Hello, Mark. If you're so sick,</i>

203
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,790
<i>then why do I have so many photos of you</i>
<i>up and about?</i>

204
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,590
<i>Let's put your so-called illness to the test.</i>

205
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,580
<i>Right now, there's a slow-acting</i>
<i>poison in your veins.</i>

206
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,550
<i>The antidote is inside the safe.</i>

207
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,620
Help!

208
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,630
<i>The combination to the safe...</i>
<i>is written on the wall.</i>

209
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,710
<i>Hurry up and program it in.</i>

210
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,830
<i>But watch your step.</i>

211
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,940
<i>By the way, that's a flammable substance</i>
<i>smeared on your body.</i>

212
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,110
<i>So, I would be careful</i>
<i>with that candle, if I were you.</i>

213
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,710
<i>Or all the people you've burned with your act</i>
<i>just might have their revenge.</i>

214
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,180
Aaaargh!

215
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,790
I found something else.

216
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,790
Well, two things, actually.

217
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,990
There was someone standing outside,
watching through this hole.

218
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,710
Our friend Jigsaw likes to book himself
front-row seats to his own sick little games.

219
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,990
<i>He was there at the last one as well.</i>

220
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,270
Only, this time...he left us his penlight.

221
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,510
Hm...

222
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,470
Get a rush on the prints.

223
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,830
Copy that.

224
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,750
This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe
tumor extending across the midline.

225
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,550
It started as colon cancer.

226
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,750
The patient has come in for a standard checkup,

227
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,310
by which we can monitor the rate
at which his condition is declining.

228
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,700
- The patient had...
- His name is John.

229
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,910
Dr. Gordon. He's a very interesting person.

230
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,430
Thank you for that information, Zep.

231
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,300
<i>As you can see, our orderlies</i>
<i>form very special bonds with the patients.</i>

232
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,550
<i>Continuing on, the patient had...</i>

233
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,350
TANNOY: <i>Dr. Gordon, please page the operator.</i>

234
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,150
Someone doesn't want me to tell you
what the patient had! Excuse me.

235
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,940
Dr. Gordon.

236
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,110
I'm Detective Tapp, this is Detective Sing.
City homicide.

237
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,710
- Very impressive.
- Oh, thank you.

238
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,470
I do my best.

239
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,390
- Sorry to interrupt you while you work.
- <i>Fine.</i>

240
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,430
Now, how can I help you gentlemen?

241
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,150
Are you able to tell us where you were
between the hours of 11 PM and 1 AM last night?

242
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,990
Why is it that you're interested?

243
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,380
We'd like to ask a few questions about it.

244
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,950
For your sake, I think it's best
if we do it down at the station.

245
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,470
- Would you like to follow us there?
- I'm afraid that's out of the question.

246
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,670
I can't just leave, I have work to do.
Plus my wife has the car today.

247
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,990
That's OK. You can ride with us.

248
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,350
Doc?

249
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,710
(Laughs) I'm sorry.

250
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,310
You'll have to tell me again.
What is this all about?

251
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,350
Is this yours, Doctor?

252
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,870
<i>So you have no idea how your penlight</i>
<i>showed up at the murder scene?</i>

253
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,910
Of course not, Brett.

254
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,310
Well, I have to ask.
What <i>were</i> you doing last night?

255
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,070
I was seeing someone.

256
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,950
Who?

257
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,750
Look, if you can't be honest with me...

258
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,790
I was visiting someone, It wasn't a patient.

259
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,670
<i>All right?</i>

260
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,910
What am I gonna do?

261
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,460
Well, as your lawyer and your friend,

262
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,630
my advice to you is to bite the bullet
and give them your alibi now,

263
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,790
<i>cos no-one's gonna believe you later.</i>

264
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,390
(Sighs)

265
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,070
That was five months ago.

266
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,510
He tried to set me up for murder.

267
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,790
OK.

268
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,110
We checked your alibi, It holds up.

269
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,230
Good. Can I go home now?

270
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,470
We have one of the victims
who managed to escape.

271
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,750
Want to know if you wouldn't mind sticking
around and listening to her testimony.

272
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,750
Maybe it'll trigger something.

273
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,750
- I'd like to help, really, but...
- Well, we'd appreciate it.

274
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,220
- She's the only one who made it.
- OK.

275
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,550
Amanda...

276
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,900
In your own time...

277
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,560
tell me the first thing you remember.

278
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,270
AMANDA: <i>I woke up.</i>

279
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,430
<i>All I could taste was blood.</i>

280
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,990
(Groaning)

281
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,550
<i>And metal.</i>

292

<i>Think of it like a reverse bear trap.</i>

293

<i>There's only one key to open the device.</i>

297
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,710
<i>It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.</i>

298
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,990
<i>Look around, Amanda.</i>

299
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,150
<i>Know that I'm not lying.</i>

300
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,540
<i>You'd better hurry up.</i>

301
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,590
<i>Live or die.</i>

302
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,430

(Sniffs)

307
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,310
And then I saw the body.

(Hyperventilates)

310
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,950
There was a knife.

<i>He'd been injected with an opiate overdose.</i>

<i>Couldn't move or feel much of anything.</i>

318

You mean...he was alive?

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,780
Was.

320
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,350
What happened after you took it off?

321
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,150
(Screams)

322
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,590
(Wails hysterically)

323
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,710
(Squeaking)

324
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,430
SINISTER VOICE:
<i>Congratulations. You are still alive.</i>

325
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,870
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.

326
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,110
But not you. Not any more.

327
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,950
You are, in fact, a drug addict.
Isn't that right, Mandy?

328
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,980
Do you think that is why he picked you?

329
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,030
(Sobs)

330
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,670
<i>Are you grateful, Mandy?</i>

331
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,110
He...helped me.

332
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,950
(Sobbing)

333
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,670
(Light buzzes)

334
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,070
Are you sure it's him?

335
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,780
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- <i>How do I know you're telling the truth?</i>

336
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,390
You could be the one who <i>put</i> me in this room!

337
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,110
I'm in exactly the same situation you're in.

338
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,350
Wrong. Wrong! You've got one thing I don't.

339
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,470
Information. You know who did this.

340
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,380
Now, you either tell me what is really going on,
or I'll cut you with this!

341
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,430
I'll cu...

342
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,220
- What?
- It's a two-way mirror.

343
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,710
MAN: I can see you.

344
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,230
<i>So, that's what this is. Reality TV.</i>

345
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,830
MAN: Don't look at me, I can't help you.

346
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,510
Can you hear me in there? Huh?
I'm having a blast.

347
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,750
This is the most fun I've had without lubricant.

348
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,550
Make sure you're getting everything.

349
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,750
That's not gonna do anything.

350
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,310
- <i>You want to leave it running on us?</i>
- <i>You won't stop it.</i>

351
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,510
That's why we can't cut through these chains
or why you won't break that glass.

352
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,710
Every possible angle
has been pre-thought out by him.

353
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,550
You make it sound like you admire this prick.

354
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,230
To overcome something, you have to
understand what a perfect engine it is.

355
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,950
<i>That's how you fight disease.</i>

356
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,270
<i>The tape told us to find an X.</i>

357
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,710
That X has to be somewhere in this room.
Help me find it.

358
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,030
How can you be the calm doctor when
your wife and kid are out there?

359
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,710
<i>He has them too.</i>
<i>He could be doing anything to them now.</i>

360
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,830
- <i>Are you thinking about that?</i>
- I <i>am</i> thinking about that.

361
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,190
I've been thinking about
the last thing I said to my daughter.

362
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,150
(Ticking)

363
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,550
Diana, honey, are you OK?

364
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,710
Diana, honey, can you hear me?

365
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,070
- Mommy...
- What is it, sweet pea?

366
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,670
There's a man in my room.

367
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,190
Oh, honey, are you sure he's not
just hiding in your imagination?

368
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,230
He talked to me.

369
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,430
OK, I'll come and check your room.

370
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,430
I want Daddy. He'll get the scary man.

371
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,950
All right, if you want. Come on.

372
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,950
Larry, sorry to bother you,
but your daughter had a bad dream again.

373
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,390
Just a minute.

374
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,700
She wants you to check her room.

375
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,150
Mm-hm. Just got to finish this paragraph.

376
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,430
Come on, sweetie, I'll check with you.

377
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,430
Nope, I'm done.

378
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,230
See? There's no-one in your room.

379
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,430
There's no such thing as the Bad Man.

380
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,190
- Now can you go to sleep?
- <i>I'm still scared.</i>

381
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,470
You are? Give me your tootsie.

382
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,750
Oh, what a big tootsie.

383
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,950
Remember this one?

384
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,150
This little piggy went to market.

385
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,390
This little piggy stayed home.

386
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,590
This little piggy had roast beef.

387
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,710
This little piggy had none.

388
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,830
This little piggy ran...

389
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,710
Whee! All the way home!

390
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,310
(Pager bleeps)

391
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,030
I hate that thing.

392
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,350
Well, I have to go to work, sweetheart.

393
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,070
You know what Daddy's job is like.
Now, come on.

394
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,950
Let's see.

395
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,110
Try and get some sleep, now, OK?

396
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,550
You're not gonna leave us, are you, Daddy?

397
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,110
What?

398
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,150
What are you talking about?

399
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,950
You mean, leave you and Mommy?

400
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,230
No. No, sweetheart, I...

401
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,270
I would never do that.

402
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,350
- Who gave you that idea?
- No-one.

403
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,870
Well, it's not true. OK?

404
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,990
- <i>OK.</i>
- How much do I love you?

405
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,910
- Love you very much.
- That's right. That's right.

406
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,880
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night, Daddy.

407
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,510
Tomorrow...I'll read you your favorite story.

408
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,990
OK.

409
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,790
ALISON: <i>I don't know</i>
<i>how much longer I can do this.</i>

410
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,830
- What are you talking about?
- How can you pretend you're happy?

411
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,070
- I am happy.
- That is complete bullshit.

412
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,350
ALISON:
<i>I'd rather you just tell me you hate me.</i>

413
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,740
<i>At least there would be some passion in it.</i>

414
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,430
(Ticking)

415
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,670
Would you like to see her?

416
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,910
- She's beautiful.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

417
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,150
You gonna have any more kids?

418
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,110
Ah, we've...talked about it, but er...

419
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,190
..with our schedules,

420
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,710
it's difficult enough to concentrate on one.

421
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,390
So, where's the lucky wife?

422
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,590
There's another picture
behind the one you're looking at.

423
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,990
<i>It's my favorite one because...</i>
<i>we're all in it together.</i>

424
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,470
Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera,

425
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,470
<i>which means I'm always missing</i>
<i>from the photos.</i>

426
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,990
It's er... It's not here.

427
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,670
What?

428
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,990
This photo you're talking about's not here.

429
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,110
Really? Are you sure?

430
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,150
Yeah. Just...

431
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,870
Why, he... he must have taken it, I...

432
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,870
ALISON: <i>How can you pretend you're happy?</i>

433
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,580
- I am happy.
- That is complete bullshit.

434
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,590
I'd rather you just tell me you hate me.

435
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,630
At least there would be some passion in it.

436
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,510
We'll talk about this later. OK?

437
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,310
Just leave.

438
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,510
(Door creaks)

439
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,990
(Footsteps)

440
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,390
(Panting)

441
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,590
MAN: <i>Good night, little girl.</i>

442
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,750
(Screams)

443
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,510
Diana?

444
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,750
Diana? (Gasps)

445
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,340
(Screams)

446
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,350
Diana!

447
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,750
(Diana cries)

448
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,630
<i>Mommy!</i>

449
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,870
ALISON: Shh.

450
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,630
(Diana whimpers)

451
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,430
(Alison breathes heavily)

452
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,870
(Muffled) Don't you dare!

453
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,870
Get away from her!

454
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,910
(Heartbeat pounds)

455
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,670
Mommy!

456
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,270
(Rapid heartbeat)

457
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,300
Mommy!

458
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,550
Mommy! Mommy!

459
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,270
(Muffled)
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!

460
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,270
Get off of her!

461
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,910
(Wailing)

462
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,910
(Diana sobs hysterically)

463
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,790
(Tapp whispers)
<i>Oh, you little man! I see you.</i>

464
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,430
<i>Does Dr. Gordon know</i>
<i>you're at home with his wife?</i>

465
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,070
<i>I know you know something.</i>

466
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,110
<i>What are you doing in there?</i>

467
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,870
<i>Waiting for the doctor?</i>
<i>I'm waiting for the doctor, too.</i>

468
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,630
Huh!

469
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,790
I never should have let you go.

470
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,470
(Screaming)

471
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,910
WOMAN: <i>There was someone</i>
<i>standing outside here watching.</i>

472
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,750
SINISTER VOICE: <i>I want to play a game.</i>

473
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,750
TAPP: <i>Jigsaw piece.</i>
<i>We're gonna be here for a while. Sing.</i>

474
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,790
SINISTER VOICE: <i>Hello, Amanda.</i>

475
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,670
<i>Dr. Gordon, are you able to tell us</i>
<i>where were you last night?</i>

476
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,590
<i>You have no idea how your penlight</i>
<i>showed up at the murder scene?</i>

477
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,350
- We checked your alibi, it holds up.
- Isn't that right?

478
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,470
TAPP: <i>I never should have let you go.</i>

479
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,230
Here we are.

480
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,150
That was er...

481
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,540
quite an amazing story that poor woman told.

482
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,780
Look, I'm...

483
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,390
I'm sorry I can't be of more help
to your investigation.

484
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,830
You know, we arrested a dentist last week.

485
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,990
He liked to play with kids a bit too much.

486
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,710
He lived two blocks from here.

487
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:05,510
The sewer lines run under <i>this</i> neighborhood,
too...Doctor.

488
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,350
(Starts engine)

489
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,470
SINISTER VOICE: <i>Hello, Amanda.</i>

490
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,150
<i>You don't know me, but I know you.</i>

491
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,270
<i>I want to play a game.</i>
<i>Here's what happens if you lose.</i>

492
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,230
<i>There's a timer at the back</i>
<i>of the device you're wearing.</i>

493
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,310
<i>When the timer goes off...</i>

494
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,830
(Forwards tape)

495
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,310
- I'll catch you guys down there.
- <i>...like a reverse bear trap.</i>

496
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,390
<i>I'll show you.</i>

497
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,790
- Hey, Tapp.
- Hmm?

498
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,950
We're gonna go down to get a beer.
You want to come?

499
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,750
I don't think so. But thanks, anyway.

500
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,510
Well, you know, I always ask.

501
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,030
- <i>There is one key to open the device.</i>
- Have fun.

502
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,470
<i>It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.</i>

503
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,830
Hey, Tapp.
I don't mean for this to be disrespectful.

504
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,270
Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.

505
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,790
(Both chuckle)

506
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,830
<i>It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate.</i>
<i>Look around...</i>

507
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,550
<i>Look around, Amanda. Know that I'm not lying.</i>

508
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,590
<i>You'd better hurry up.</i>

509
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,590
Wait, wait, wait. Sing.

510
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,790
- Get back here.
- What?

511
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,750
(Sighs)

512
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,790
What?

513
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,550
Remember 118th Street?

514
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,710
Er...K2K. That gang's territory
was only about four blocks.

515
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,750
Now, listen to this.

516
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,510
(Static)

517
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,270
(Alarm ringing faintly)

518
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,310
Check the records for all fire emergencies
in that area within the last two weeks.

519
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,670
<i>Go - right now.</i>

520
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,790
Mmm!

521
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,270
On Tuesday 17th, a fire alarm went off
in the rear wing of 213 Stygian Street.

522
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,190
It's an old listing.
Used to be a mannequin factory.

523
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,230
Think we have enough for a warrant, though?

524
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,270
Who said anything about a warrant?

525
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,710
Right now?

526
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,470
Why not?

527
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,150
Yeah, why not?

528
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,230
(Loads gun)

529
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,630
TAPP: At least we'll have the cover of darkness.

530
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,950
SING: Yeah, well, so will anybody else.

531
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,750
(Banging)

532
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,870
(Tapp grunts)

533
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,230
I got you.

534
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,870
What the hell is this?

535
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,830
Shit.

536
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,150
- (Groaning)
SING: Oh, fuck!

537
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,790
(Moaning)

538
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,270
(Door opens)

539
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,390
Wait, Sing. Let's see what he's gonna do.

540
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,390
- Why? We fuckin' got him.
- We don't know what he looks like.

541
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,150
- Let's see what he's gonna do.
- No fucking way.

542
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,950
Fuck that, I'm gonna take him.

543
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,030
What the fuck? Shit!

544
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,950
(Muffled shouts)

545
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,990
(Muffled moaning)

546
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,550
(Moaning)

547
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,180
- (Moaning)
MAN: Awake already, Jeff?

548
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,390
I need more-powerful tranquillizers next time.

549
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,310
Don't cry, I've given your life a purpose.

550
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,350
You're a test subject
for something greater than yourself.

551
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,550
Freeze!

552
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,020
- Hold it right there!
- Put your hands in the air!

553
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,260
(Whimpers)

554
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,750
(Drills whir)

555
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,390
MAN: Now you'll make a choice.
In 20 seconds, the life of this man will be ended.

556
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,070
- Get down here!
- Turn it off!

557
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,870
<i>Sing, stop that thing, I'm taking him down.</i>

558
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,940
Fine.

559
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,310
Move!

560
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,390
- How do you turn it off?
- Tell him, asshole!

561
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,860
MAN: One key will unlock it.
- Where is it?

562
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,030
- It's in the box.
- Box?

563
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,630
Fuck!

564
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:20,510
- Which key? Which key?
- Tell him which key it is!

565
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,790
- Time's running out.
- Shut up and get down here!

566
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,070
<i>Now, asshole!</i>

567
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,150
What's more important to you, Officer?
Arresting me or the life of a human being?

568
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,350
Get down on your knees, asshole!
Hands behind your head!

569
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,950
- Tapp!
- Sick bastard!

570
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,740
- Yes, I'm sick, Officer.
- Tapp, there's a hundred keys here!

571
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,350
Sick from the disease eating away at me inside.

572
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,910
Sick of people
who don't appreciate their blessings.

573
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,790
Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.

574
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,670
I'm sick of 'em all!

575
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,630
Tapp!

576
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,870
(Groans)

577
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,510
(Tapp groans)

578
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,750
No! No! Tapp! Tapp!

579
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,750
Shit! You're OK. Let me see.

580
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,670
I'll be back, I'm gonna be back, OK? I'll be back.

581
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,030
Freeze, or I'll shoot!

582
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,870
(Empty cartridge falls)

583
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,310
(Groans)

584
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,510
(Groans)

585
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,630
I had you.

586
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,020
I had you on your knees.

587
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,950
But you're running. You're running.

588
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,340
You're running scared cos...
cos we had you.

589
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,670
We're gonna close this case.

590
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,670
Gonna close it. Right, Sing? Right?

591
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,710
We're gonna close it, Sing.

592
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,180
LAWRENCE: <i>"X" marks the spot.</i>
<i>"X" marks the spot.</i>

593
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,070
<i>We need to search this room again.</i>

594
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,070
<i>What are you doing over there?</i>

595
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:57,550
<i>Excuse me.</i>

596
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,710
Just because I'm stuck in this room with you

597
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,750
<i>doesn't mean I have to report</i>
<i>to you every 10 seconds.</i>

598
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,030
I really don't see the point
in us not helping one another.

599
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,190
<i>What do you want me to do? I'm on a leash.</i>

600
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,430
That's exactly why we need to talk and think.

601
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,590
- I am thinking!
- Then don't keep me in the dark

602
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,630
<i>about what you're thinking!</i>

603
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,590
Turn off the lights.

604
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,950
<i>What?</i>

605
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,830
Turn them off now, please.

606
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,630
- Why?
- Just turn them off for a second.

607
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,910
Jesus. Behind you.

608
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,190
LAWRENCE:
How come we didn't see that before?

609
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,060
The lights in here hadn't charged it.
It's glow-in-the-dark paint or something.

610
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,230
- Open it!
- It's locked.

611
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,310
The key... the one from my envelope.
Where is it?

612
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,540
Where the fuck? Here.

613
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,950
A cellphone.

614
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,230
<i>The most beautiful invention on this planet.</i>

615
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,910
<i>Make that second-most beautiful invention.</i>

616
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,510
Give me that.

617

<i>Are you joking? You're going to put something</i>
<i>you found in this room in your mouth?</i>

00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,550
Yes, I'm willing to risk it.

619
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,230
<i>Give me that sweet cancer.</i>

<i>I don't care, I really don't.</i>

621
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,230
<i>Give me one of those.</i>

SINISTER VOICE: <i>The cigarettes</i>

May I please have a cigarette?

626
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,430
I'm trying the police.

(Beeping)

628
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,310
(Beeping)
- Shit.

629
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,390
This was meant to receive calls, not make them.

630
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,310
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

631
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,350

00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,630
<i>I thought I was alone, but...</i>

635
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,630
<i>...I'm sure someone else was there.</i>

636
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,870
(Camera clicks)

637
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,750
(Busy signal)

638
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,230
Great.

639
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,710
(Dialing beeps)

640
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,990
(Beeping)

641
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,630
(Vicious roaring)

642
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,390
That...thing...was waiting for me.

643
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,560
How did you know to turn off the lights?

644
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,670
- Who cares? It worked.
- Yeah, but how did you know?

645
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,270
Instinct.

646
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,670
Instinct?

647
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,470
- Yeah.
- <i>You know what?</i>

648
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,150
You're a terrible liar.

649
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,750
You say that like you know me.

650
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,710
What else aren't you telling me?

651
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,310
Well, um, let's see...

652
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,390
On my sixth birthday, my best friend at the time,
Scott Tibbs,

653
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,830
<i>stabbed me with a rusty nail -</i>
<i>I didn't tell you that.</i>

654
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,670
My last girlfriend, a feminist vegan punk,

655
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,110
broke up with me because <i>I</i> was too angry.

656
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,670
- One of my toenails is slightly...
- Just stop it!

657
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,790
You knew to turn off these lights.

658
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,750
- Whatever.
- I'm dealing with a juvenile.

659
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,510
- You wanna know?
- Yeah!

660
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,750
Here it is.

661
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,990
Come.

662
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,030
Oh, God.

663
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,670
W-Where did you get this?

664
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,030
It was in your wallet.

665
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,030
<i>Behind the photo of your daughter.</i>

666
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,820
- Why didn't you show me this before?
- I couldn't.

667
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,510
I'm sorry.

668
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,310
(Lawrence whimpers)

669
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,350
What are you doing to them, you bastard?

670
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,630
OK. OK.

671
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,630
OK, I've got to think now.

672
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,190
<i>Think about this -</i>

673
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,630
<i>you don't need a gun to kill Adam.</i>

674
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,350
<i>When there's that much poison in your blood,</i>

675
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:23,510
<i>the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.</i>

676
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,030
<i>What are you doing?</i>

677
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,670
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

678
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,870
LAWRENCE:
(Whispers) <i>Shh. Adam, listen to me.</i>

679
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,070
<i>I want you to play along with me on this.</i>

680
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,430
(Indistinct whispering)

681
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,910
LAWRENCE: <i>You got that?</i>

682
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,390
So, you er... You still want that cigarette?

683
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,430
Um...yeah.

684
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,470
Sure.

685
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,150
(Chokes)

686
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,740
(Chokes)

687
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,310
There! I've done it!

688
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,550
<i>I've killed him with the poison like you wanted!</i>

689
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,590
Now where's my family?

690
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,070
Where are they?

691
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,070
(Electricity buzzes)

692
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,270
Aaaargh!

693
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:09,230
- Aagh! Jesus Christ!
- What are you...?

694
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,230
(Panting)
I-I-I just got electrocuted!

695
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,230
What?

696
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,700
Jesus. That was our way out!

697
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,470
Did you hear what I said? Get this thing off me!

698
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,790
- <i>Get it off!</i>
- Stop acting!

699
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:25,950
You think I would make that up just to mess up
your stupid fucking charade?

700
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,590
<i>All right, that's it.</i>

701
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,150
(Grunts)

702
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,430
Damn it!

703
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,470
(Panting)

704
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,750
I remember everything now.

705
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,030
I remember how I got here.

706
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,740
(Music on headphones)

707
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,110
(Music stops)

708
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,030
(Gasps)

709
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,070
(Sighs)

710
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,750
Oh...

711
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,820
(Snorts in disgust) Great.

712
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,870
(Door closes)

713
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,470
(Door creaks)

714
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,310
Is someone there?

715
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,030
(Flash whines)

716
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,510
(Floorboards creak)

717
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,350
I can hear you.

718
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,190
(Flash whines)

719
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,590
(Floorboards creak)

720
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,070
(Electronic laughter)
- Huh!

721
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:00,590
What the...?

722
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,430
What the Christ...?

723
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,790
(Laughter stops)

724
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,110
(Panting) What the...?

725
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,630
- (Rattling)
- Huh!

726
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,590
Who is that?

727
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,270
- Who's in there?
(Creaking)

728
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,270
Come out!

729
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,310
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

730
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,150
(Door creaks)

731
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,390
Aagh!

732
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,590
(Ticking)

733
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,350
(Cellphone rings)

734
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,790
(Beep)

735
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,390
Who is this?

736
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,750
DIANA: <i>Daddy?</i>

737
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,030
Diana.

738
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,110
(Crying) Daddy, is that you?

739
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,760
Yeah, baby, it's me, I'm here.

740
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,140
I-I'm scared, Daddy. (Sobs)

741
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,230
Don't worry, honey. Everything's gonna be OK.

742
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,860
- <i>Where's Mommy?</i>
- She's here with me.

743
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,990
Let me talk to her, sweetie.

744
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,070
OK? Put Mommy on.

745
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,390
The bad man from my room is here.

746
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:44,230
<i>He has us tied up...</i>

747
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,470
And he has a gun.

748
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,190
Wh-What man?

749
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,230
<i>Please come home, Daddy.</i>

750
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,550
Hello?

751
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,590
Hello?

752
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:57,550
Diana?

753
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,750
<i>Diana?</i>

754
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,310
Diana!

755
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,630
Larry.

756
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,790
Ali? Is that you?

757
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,830
Is Adam there?

758
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,150
<i>Well, how do you know...</i>

759
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,670
Ali...

760
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,630
What is going on?

761
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,550
Don't believe Adam's lies.

762
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,660
<i>He knows you.</i>
<i>He knew all about you before today.</i>

763
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:29,630
(Gasps)

764
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,670
(Dialing tone)

765
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,710
Hello? Ali?

766
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,510
Ali?

767
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,150
Hello!

768
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,150
Goddamn you!

769
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:45,470
If you so much as lay a finger on them,
I'll kill you.

770
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,020
You hear me, you son of a bitch? I'll kill you!

771
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:51,830
(Sobs)

772
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,910
Damn!

773
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,260
Are they OK?

774
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,590
My wife, she er... She mentioned your name.

775
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,870
What did she say?

776
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,550
She told me...

777
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,630
not to believe you.

778
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,270
Believe me about what?

779
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,310
She told me you knew me.

780
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,110
Who are you?

781
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,110
You know who I am.

782
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:35,870
Stop the lies! You're a liar!
I need to know the truth!

783
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,270
I'm a liar?

784
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,430
What did you do last night, Lawrence?

785
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,940
<i>Work at a hospital, saving sick children?</i>

786
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,670
You told me
that after you left your house last night,

787
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,670
<i>you went to work at a hospital.</i>

788
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,910
- That's because it's the truth.
- <i>No, it's not.</i>

789
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,110
Your wife is right, Larry.

790
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,790
<i>You don't recall getting your picture taken</i>
<i>in that parking lot?</i>

791
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,790
I can prove that you didn't go anywhere near
a hospital last night.

792
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,740
It's not the first time I've done it either, Larry.

793
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,190
<i>I've been taking pictures of you for days now.</i>

794
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,550
- Why?
- <i>You want to know what I do?</i>

795
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,020
I get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you,

796
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,420
who go to seedy motels to fuck their secretaries.

797
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,030
<i>Last night, I went to your house.</i>

798
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,270
<i>and watched you leave.</i>

799
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,710
<i>I followed you...</i>

800
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,830
<i>...all the way to that shit-bag hotel.</i>

801
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:03,510
You've er...had these with you the whole time?

802
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,390
I found them in there with the hacksaws.

803
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,270
<i>I don't know how they got there.</i>

804
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:14,910
- Right! You're so full of it!
- Face it, Larry, we're both bullshitters!

805
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,670
<i>But my camera isn't. It doesn't know how to lie.</i>

806
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,590
It only shows you what's put right in front of it.

807
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,710
Just out of curiosity,
what did you do in that motel room?

808
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,150
<i>You got out of there pretty fast.</i>

809
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,350
Why did you um...

810
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,390
deem it necessary to page me
when you knew I was at home?

811
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:42,390
I didn't know if you were going to make it.

812
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,070
I gave you a precise time at which to page me.

813
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,870
You can't do that.

814
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,630
It's not like I know the rules for this sort of stuff.

815
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:00,220
- What's wrong, Dr. Gordon?
- Look, um...

816
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,790
It was wrong of me to make you come here.

817
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,390
- But I thought we've...
- No, no. Please.

818
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,540
I'm sorry.

819
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,830
(Rings)

820
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,110
You tell anyone you were here?

821
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,670
No.

822
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,310
Hello.

823
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,670
- It's for you.
- For me?

824
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,190
Hello.

825
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,630
MAN: <i>I know what you're doing... Doctor.</i>

826
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,550
- I...
(Line goes dead)

827
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:15,830
(Hangs up)

828
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,270
I have to go.

829
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,510
- What happened?
- I gotta go.

830
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:40,030
- (Sighs)
(Camera clicks)

831
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,550
Who was it?

832
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,190
Who was what?

833
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,310
The person who paid you to follow me.
Who was it?

834
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:51,270
He calls himself Bob and he gives me
the money upfront. 200 bucks a night.

835
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,950
If I'd known I'd end up here,
I'd have asked for a lot more.

836
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,950
What does that mean?
Does that mean you saw what happened to me?

837
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,870
What I saw was you get into your car. That's it.

838
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,310
<i>I didn't ask your name.</i>
<i>I didn't know who you were.</i>

839
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,830
I don't know how I got here.
I don't know how you got here.

840
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,110
<i>I took the shots and went straight home</i>
<i>to develop them.</i>

841
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,950
Next thing I know, I'm chained to a pipe

842
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,510
in some prehistoric bathroom, staring at
the guy I've been taking shots of.

843
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,590
Clearly, whoever paid you to take pictures of me
is the one who put us here.

844
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,630
Maybe.

845
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:23,670
Of course it is! What did he look like?

846
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,830
- <i>Just a guy.</i>
- Was he tall? Skinny? Obese?

847
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,870
- I don't take notes.
- You must remember something about him.

848
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,390
- I can't.
- You don't remember a thing about the guy?

849
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:33,990
- I told you, I...
- For fuck's sake! I give up!

850
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,190
He's a tall black guy.
He's got a scar around his neck, OK?

851
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,430
Tapp.

852
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,790
- Detective Tapp.
- <i>Whoa.</i>

853
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,870
The guy who paid me to take these photos
was <i>not</i> a cop.

854
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,750
No, no. He was discharged from the police force.

855
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,220
He broke down after his partner was killed.

856
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,470
<i>But that didn't stop him harassing me.</i>
<i>The guy became obsessed.</i>

857
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:09,870
He's convinced I must have somehow
been involved with the murders.

858
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,470
He's crazy. And you helped him.

859
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,180
You took money from him to invade my privacy.

860
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,110
How could you do that?

861
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,760
- Call it my need to eat.
- <i>Right.</i>

862
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:24,510
Right. You know what, Adam,
you're not a victim of this game.

863
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,470
- You're part of it.
- <i>Oh, really?</i>

864
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,940
This cop thinks you're the one behind it all.

865
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,550
I told you, he's not a cop.
He's a bottom feeder, just like you!

866
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,350
What are you pissed off about?
The fact I took shots of you

867
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,670
or the fact that I took shots of you
while you cheated on your wife?

868
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:42,230
- I did not cheat on her!
- <i>What do you care what I think anyway?</i>

869
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:47,180
I don't give a crap if you covered yourself in
peanut butter and had a 15-hooker gangbang.

870
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,870
How did I get here? I had...

871
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:05,710
I had everything in order.

872
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,990
My whole life was in perfect order.

873
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,030
(Both sob)

874
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,790
(Door closes)

875
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,550
(Spits)

876
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,710
Sweetheart, are you OK?

877
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,990
Mommy just needs you to be
really, really, really, really strong right now.

878
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,950
I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.

879
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,750
<i>You got that?</i>

880
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,400
OK. That's my good girl.

881
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:21,470
ADAM: <i>Hey, was there someone else</i>
<i>at your house last night.</i>

882
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,470
<i>besides your wife and daughter?</i>

883
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:26,120
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>Well, there's someone here.</i>

884
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,590
I know him.

885
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:47,140
- Zep.
- <i>Who?</i>

886
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:51,020
His name is Zep. He's an orderly at my hospital.

887
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,630
Zep.

888
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:54,710
<i>You perverted little psychopath.</i>

889
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,070
I'm gonna take great pleasure
in seeing you pay for this,

890
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,110
<i>you bastard fuck!</i>

891
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,190
Look.

892
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,590
We're out of time.

893
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:36,380
- (Sobs)
- Shh, sweetie...sweetie.

894
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,670
- Mommy, help me!
- Ssh...

895
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,700
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

896
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:02,190
Now I've got to do what I've got to do, and...

897
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:06,430
..I'm afraid it has to be you
that tells him he failed.

898
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,830
(Cellphone rings)

899
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,230
(Panting)

900
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:17,710
(Beep)

901
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,430
Is that you, Zep, you bastard?

902
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,790
I know it's you, you son of a bitch!

903
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,790
ALISON: <i>La... Larry.</i>

904
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,350
Ali?

905
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,070
You failed.

906
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,270
Hello?

907
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:31,910
Hello?

908
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,910
- You!
- Wait.

909
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,950
(Panting)

910
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:41,790
Don't move! Stay on the ground.

911
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,670
Give me... Give me the phone.

912
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,590
Give it to me!

913
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:58,670
Larry?

914
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,270
Ali! Honey, are you all right?

915
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:04,350
No... No, we're not. Get down!

916
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,270
- Larry, where are you?
- I don't know.

917
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,740
I'm being held captive in a room somewhere.

918
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:13,430
(Sobs)
Wh-What are you talking about?

919
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,710
- <i>I'm so sorry, Ali.</i>
- Honey, we need you here.

920
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,990
<i>So sorry for everything. It's my fault.</i>

921
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,460
Forgive me, I've always been happy with you.

922
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,230
Mommy!

923
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,390
- Aagh!

Aargh! Aaargh!

<i>Oh, no!</i>

935

(Gun clicks)
- What the fuck?

936
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,310
- Yaaaa!
- Ya!

937
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:40,230
(Sobs)

938
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,630
Argh! Urgh!

(Panting)

940
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,510
Mrs. Gordon?

941
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,150
Diana!

942
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,510
I'm gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon.

Lawrence!

(Buzzing stops)

948
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,350
Lawrence, get up!

949
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,510
Lawrence! Get up!

950

<i>I need you!</i>

Oh, thank God, I thought you were dead.

(Groans)

953
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:21,710
He...He... He electrocuted me.

954
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,910
I told you.
The same thing happened to me. See?

955
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,030
<i>I wasn't lying. See?</i>

956
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,950
Fuck this shit!

957
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:50,870
- (Grunts)
- (Cellphone rings)

958
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,030
(Ringing)

959
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,830
No!

960
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,510
Lawrence, calm down.

961
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,710
- There must be a way out of this.
- Shut up!

962
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,230
Just shut up! My family needs me!

963
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,900
No! God!

964
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,910
God! No!

965
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,350
Argh!

966
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:58,110
(Screams)

967
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,630
Lawrence! I have a family too.

968
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:04,470
I don't see them, that's my mistake.
It's a mistake I'd like to fix.

969
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,380
I'm gonna kill you, you sick asshole.

970
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,190
(Screams)

971
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,340
<i>Lawrence!</i>

972
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:16,620
Stop it.

973
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,430
(Phone rings)

974
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,910
<i>Lawrence, just calm down.</i>

975
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,510
There's a way out of here.
There's a way out!

976
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,430
Lawrence!

977
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:30,350
No! What are you... No!

978
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,870
Oh, my God! Lawrence!

979
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:37,060
What are you doing?

980
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,790
(Both scream)

981
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,870
What...are you doing?

982
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:11,030
What are you... What are you...

983
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,710
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

984
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:19,070
<i>Lawrence, don't! No!</i>

985
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:21,070
<i>No, Lawrence, please!</i>

986
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,460
<i>I'm begging you!</i>

987
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:26,070
Lawrence! It's not me who did this to you!

988
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:30,230
- You have to die.
- No! I want to live!

989
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,230
- I'm sorry.
- I want to live!

990
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,550
- My family...
- Argh!

991
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,350
(Sobs)

992
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,190
There! I've done it!

993
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:53,230
Now show them to me!

994
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,430
Show them to me.

995
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,710
- Thank you very much, Officer.
- Larry?

996
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,710
Did you get through to him?

997
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,180
- There's still no answer.
- I've called the police.

998
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,230
Everything is OK.

999
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:15,750
(Banging)

1000
01:29:22,040 --> 01:29:23,550
<i>You bastard!</i>

1001
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:26,670
I'll fucking kill you! I'll fucking kill you!

1002
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,670
You fucking bastard!

1003
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:32,270
I'll fucking kill you!
You fucking bastard!

1004
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,390
- I'll fucking kill you!
(Gun clicks)

1005
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,950
I'll fucking kill you.

1006
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:47,230
<i>You're too late.</i>

1007
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:49,950
- Why?
- It's the rules.

1008
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,150
Argh!

1009
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,350
(Gunshot)

1010
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,950
(Gunshot)

1011
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,910
You're gonna be all right.

1012
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,510
You're just wounded... wounded in the shoulder.

1013
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,190
I have to go and get help.

1014
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,540
Don't leave me!

1015
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:44,860
No!

1016
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,910
No! No!

1017
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,750
No! Ow!

1018
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,150
D-Don't worry.

1019
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:02,670
<i>I'll bring someone back.</i>

1020
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,310
I promise.

1021
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,360
Key.

1022
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,950
Key. Key!

1023
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:08,670
SINISTER VOICE: <i>Hello, Mr. Hindle.</i>

1024
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,030
<i>Or as they called you around the hospital...</i>

1025
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:13,060
<i>...Zep.</i>

1026
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,110
<i>I want you to make a choice.</i>

1027
01:32:15,880 --> 01:32:17,790
(Diana screams)

1028
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:22,750
<i>There's a slow-acting poison</i>
<i>coursing through your system</i>

1029
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,630
<i>which only I have the antidote for.</i>

1030
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:28,100
<i>Will you murder a mother and her child</i>

1031
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,470
<i>to save yourself?</i>

1032
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,430
Dr. Gordon's time is up.

1033
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,710
Mrs. Gordon!

1034
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,710
<i>Listen carefully, if you will. There are rules.</i>

1035
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:40,100
- Why?
- It's the rules.

1036
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:04,830
(Groans)

1037
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:29,140
The key to that chain is in the bathtub.

1038
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:42,350
He's a very interesting person.
His name is John.

1039
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:44,740
He has an inoperable frontal-lobe tumor.

1040
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:48,030
- <i>Sick from disease eating away at me inside.</i>
- Sounds like Jigsaw.

1041
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,870
<i>I'm sick of people</i>
<i>not appreciating their blessings.</i>

1042
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:54,350
He books himself front-row seats
to his own sicko games.

1043
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:58,140
<i>Hello, Mark, Paul, Amanda,</i>
<i>Zep, Adam, Dr. Gordon.</i>

1044
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,870
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

1045
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:07,470
(Electricity buzzes)

1046
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:28,430
<i>Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.</i>

1047
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:30,870
<i>But not you.</i>

1048
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:34,030
<i>Not any more.</i>

1049
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:36,070
(Screams)

1050
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,110
Game over.

1051
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,990
Argh! Argh!

1052
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:45,790
Don't! Don't!

1053
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:49,470
Don't! Argh!

1054
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,510
(Screaming fades)
