took

But
Dad,
didn't
you
ever
want
to
do
something
else?

Something
besides
noodles?
I
thought
about
running
away
and
learning
how
to
make
tofu.

So,
why
didn't
you?
Can
you
imagine
me
making

I

sucked

anyone

in

in

the

How

Shifu

going

turn
me
into
the

I

I'm

the

I've

no

no

Quit,

You

too

with
what
was

There's

there

when
Master
Shifu
-
actually
used
to
smile.
-
Yes.
-
Before
what?
We're
not
really
supposed
to
talk
about
him.
Well,
if
he's
going
to
stay
here,
he
should
know.
Guys,
guys,
I
know
about
Tai
Lung.
He
was
a
student.
The
first
ever
to
master
the
thousand
scrolls
of
kung
fu.
And
then
he
turned
bad
and
now
he's
in
jail
and...
He
wasn't
just
a
student.
-
'Shifu
found
him
as
a
cub.'
-
'And
he
raised
him
as
his
son.'
'And
when
the
boy
showed
talent
in
kung
fu,
'Shifu
trained
him.'
'He
believed
in
him.
He
told
him
he
was
destined
for
greatness.'
-
Ya!
'He
wanted
the
Dragon
Scroll,
'but
Oogway
saw
darkness
in
his
heart
and
refused.'
'Outraged,
Tai
Lung
laid
waste
to
the
valley.'
'He
tried
to
take
the
scroll
by
force
'and
Shifu
had
to
destroy
what
he
had
created.'
'But
how
could
he?'
SHIFU
PANTS
'Shifu
loved
Tai
Lung
like
he
had
never
loved
anyone
before...'
Hi-ha-hoo!
Huh!
-
A-ha.
'..or
since.'
SHE
SIGHS
And
now
he
has
a
chance
to
make
things
right,
to
train
the
true
Dragon
Warrior,
and
he's
stuck
with
you,
a
big
fat
panda
-
who
treats
it
like
a
joke.
-
Oh,
that
is
it!
I
accidentally
tweaked
his
facial

And
may
have
also
stopped
his

Ah,

There

There
is
no

Master,
your
vision.
Your
vision
was
right.
Tai
Lung
has
broken
out
of
prison.
He's
on

That
is
bad

..if
you
do
not

that
the
Dragon

can
stop
him.
The
panda?
Master,
that

is
not
the

He
wasn't

be
here!
It
was
an

There

the

will
never
fulfil
his
destiny
nor
you
yours

you
let
go

the
illusion
of
control.
-
Illusion?
I
cannot
make
it
blossom
when
it
suits
me,
nor
make
it
bear
fruit
before
its
time.
-
But
there
are
things
we
can
control.
I
can
control
when
the
fruit
will
fall.
-
HE

Ya!
..where
to
plant
the
seed.
Ha-ya!
That
is
no

Master.
Ah,
yes.
But
no
matter
what
you
do,
that
seed
will
grow
to
be
a
peach
tree.
You
may
wish
for
an
apple
or
an
orange
but
you
will
get
a
peach.
-
But
a
peach
cannot
defeat
Tai
Lung!
if
you
are
willing
to
guide
it,
to
nurture
it,
to
believe
in
it.
But
how?
How?
-
I
need
your
help,
Master.
Promise
me,
Shifu.
Promise
me
you
will
believe.
I...
I
will

Hm,

You

can
survive
for
months
at
a

on
nothing
but
the
dew
of

and
the

I

You're

Then
why
didn't
you

You

I
wanted

you

I

it
hurt,
but
it
could
never
hurt
more
than
it
did
every

just
being

I
stayed
because
I
thought
if

could
change

could

it
was

Guys?!
They're
dead!
No,
they're
breathing.
They're
asleep?
No,
their
eyes
are
open.
-
We
were
no
match
for
his
nerve
attack.
Who?
Tai
Lung?
Stronger?
-
He's
too
fast!
Sorry,
Po.
-
I
thought
we
could
stop
him.
-
Why
didn't
he?
-
but
it
won't
work.
I
mean,
a
little.
I'm
pretty
scared.
-
You
can
defeat
him,
panda!
They're
five
masters.
I'm
just
one
me.
But
you
will
have
the
one
thing
that
no-one
else
does.
-
You
really
believe
I'm
ready?
Po.
HE
BREATHES
HEAVILY
Behold
the
Dragon
Scroll.
-
It
is
yours.
No-one
knows,
but
legend
says
you
will
be
able
to
hear
-
a
butterfly's
wing
beat.
Yes.
And
see
light
in
the
deepest
cave.
You
will
feel
the
universe
in
motion
around
you.
Wow!
Can
I
punch
through
walls?
C-C-Can
I
do
a
quadruple
back
flip?
-
Focus.
Read
it,
Po,
and
fulfil
your
destiny.
Read
it
and
become
the
Dragon
Warrior.
Whoa!
HE
GRUNTS
It's
impossible
to
open.
PO
GRUNTS:
OK.
Come
on,
baby.
Come
on,
now.
POPPING
Thank
you.
I
probably
loosened
it
up
for
you,
though.
CLEARS
THROAT
OK,
here
goes.
HE
SCREAMS
ALL
GASP
-
It's
blank.
Blank.
I
don't...
I
don't
understand.
OK.
So,
like,
Oogway
was
just
a
crazy
old
turtle
after
all.
No.
Oogway
was
wiser
than
us
all.
Oh,
come
on!
Face
it,
he
picked
me
by
accident.
Of
course
I'm
not
the
Dragon
Warrior.
Who
am
I
kidding?
But
who
will
stop
Tai
Lung?
He'll
destroy
everything
and
everyone.
No.
Evacuate
the
valley.
You
must
protect
the
villagers
from
Tai
Lung's
rage.
-
What
about
you,
Master?
-
What?
But
Shifu,
he'll
kill
you.
Then
I
will
finally
have
paid
for
my
mistake.
Listen
to
me,
all
of
you.
It
is
time
for
you
to
continue
your
journey
without
me.
I
am
very
proud
to
have
been
your
master.
-
We've
got
to
get
them
out
safely.
-
Let's
find
your
mama.
Mantis,
the
north.
Crane,
light
the
way.
Look,
it's
the
Dragon
Warrior
-
Hey,
Dad.
Good
to
have
you
back,
son.
-
Good
to
be
back.
CREAKING
So,
for
our
next
shop
it's
time
to
face
it.
The
future
of
noodles
is
dice-cut
vegetables,
no
longer
slices.
Also,
I
was
thinking
maybe
this
time
we'll
have
a
kitchen
you
can
actually
stand
up
in.
Hm?
You
like
that?
Uh,
Po,
I-I'm
sorry
if
things
didn't
work
out.
I-I-It
just
wasn't
meant
to
be.
Po,
forget
everything
else.
Your
destiny
still
awaits.
We
are
noodle
folk.
Broth
runs
deep
through
our
veins.
I
don't
know,
Dad.
Honestly,
sometimes
I
can't
believe
I'm
actually
your
son.
Oh!
Po,
I
think
it's
time
I
told
you
something
I
should
have
told
you
-
a
long
time
ago.
The
secret
ingredient
of
my
Secret
Ingredient
Soup.
Oh!
Come
here.
The
secret
ingredient
is...
-
..nothing!
You
heard
me.
Nothing!
There
is
no
secret
ingredient!
Wait,
wait.
It's
just
plain
old
noodle
soup?
-
You
don't
add
some
kind
of
special
sauce
or
something?
To
make
something
special,
you
have
to
believe
it's
special.
THUNDER
There
is
no
secret
ingredient.
LIGHTNING

This
is
no
longer
your
home
and
I
am
no
longer
your
master.
Oh,
yes.
You
have
a
new
favourite.
So
where
is
this
"Po"?
Did
I
scare
him
off?
This
battle
is
between
you
and
me.
-
So,
that
is
how
it's
going
to
be.
HE
GROWLS
AND
SNARLS
HE
SCREAMS
-
HE
GRUNTS
I
rotted
in
jail
for
20
years
-
because
of
your
weakness!
You
knew
I
was
the
Dragon
Warrior.
'You
always
knew.'
'But
when
Oogway
said
otherwise,
what
did
you
do?'
'What
did
you
do?!'
-
Nothing!
-
That
was
not
my
fault!
Who
filled
my
head
with
dreams?!
Who
drove
me
to
train
until
my
bones
cracked?!
Who
denied
me
my
destiny?!
Hya!

It

All
I
ever
did,

are,
Shifu!

Tell

Tell

SHIFU
GRUNTS

I...
I
have
always
been
proud
of
you.
From
the
first
moment,
I've
been...
proud
of
you.
And
it
was
my
pride
that
blinded
me.
I
loved
you
too
much
to
see
what
you
were
becoming...
..what
I...
was
turning
you
into.
I'm
s...
I'm
sorry.
-
HE
GROWLS:
I
want
my
scroll!
What?!
Where
is
it?!
Dragon
Warrior
has
taken
the

halfway

China

Wow.

Oogway

You
