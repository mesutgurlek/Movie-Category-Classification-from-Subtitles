version
Well,
we
all
do.
That's
why
we're
making
the
new
version.
Right,
OK,
let's
go.

Yep,
solid

God,
I'm
so
late.
You
sure
you
don't
mind
No,
really.
I'm
just
feeling
so
rotten.
-
I
love
you.
I
love
you
even
when
you're
sick
I
know.
Now,
go
or
you
will
actually
miss
it.
Right.
-
Did
I
mention
that
I
love
you?
Karen,
it's
me
again.
I'm
sorry,
I
literally
don't
have
Absolutely.
Horrible
moment,
though.
Of
course.
Doesn't
mean
I'm
not
terribly
concerned

Er,
bugger
off,
call
me
later.
So
what's
this
big
news?
We've
been
given
our
parts
and
I'm
the
lobster.

The
lobster?
-
In
the

play?
There
was
more
than
one
lobster
present
Duh.
Best
sandwiches
in
Britain.
Try
my
lovely
nuts?
Beautiful
muffin
for
a
beautiful
lady.
Morning,
my
future
wife.

OK,
you
can
stop
there.
Thanks.

I
need
a
couple
of
orange
gels.
By
the
way,
he
introduced
me
as
John
Oh,
fine.
Nice
to
meet
you,
Jack.
He
got
me
right,
though.
I'm
just
Judy.
Great,
Just
Judy!
-
No
surprises?
-
Not
like
the
stag
night?
-
You
admit
the
prostitutes
were
a
mistake?
And
it
would've
been
much
better
That
is
true.
Good
luck,
kiddo.


Prime
Minister,
over
here!

Thank
you.
-
Welcome,
Prime
Minister.
How
are
you?
-
How
are
you
feeling?
Cool.
Powerful.
Would
you
like
to
meet
Yes,
I
would
like
that
very
much
indeed.
Anything
to
put
off
-
This
is
Terence.
He's
in
charge.
Good
morning.
Hated
him,
I
think
he
was
a
pervert.
-
This
is
Pat.
Good
morning,
sir.
I'm
the
housekeeper.
Oh,
right.
I
should
be
easier
than
the
last
lot.
No
nappies,
no
teenagers,
no
scary
wife.
And
this
is
Natalie.
She's
new,
like
you.
-
Hello,
Natalie.
Shit,
I
can't
believe
I've
just
said
that.
And
now
I've
gone
and
said
"shit".
You
could've
said
"fuck"
Thank
you,
sir.
I
had
a
premonition
Oh,
piss
it!
Right,
I'll
get
my
things
Yeah,
I
can't
see
why
not.
-
It's
all
right.
-
Yes,
I
did.
-
Hello
there.
Yeah,
I'm
in
here.
OK.
Good.
Thank
you.
Ah.

Oh,
no.
That
is
so
inconvenient.
In
the
presence
of
God,
and
made
their
marriage
vows
They've
declared
their
marriage
I
therefore
proclaim

And
you
resisted
Yeah,
I'm
mature
now.
(?
Wedding
March
becomes

Love,
love,
love
?
Love,
love,
love
-
?
Love,
love,
love...?
Er,
no.
?
Love,
love,
love,
love
?
There's
nothing
you
can
do
Oh,
it...
?
There's
nothing
you
can
sing
?
There's
nothing
you
can
say
?
It's
easy
?
All
you
need
is
love
?
All
you
need
is
love
?
All
you
need
is
love,
love
?
Love
is
all
you
need...?
Look,
it's
Pikey.
Hello!
What
the
hell
are
you
doing
here?
Oh,
I
just
popped
over
-
The
lady
of
the
house
let
you
in,
did
she?
-
Lovely,
obliging
girl.
I
thought
I'd
pop
back
and
see
-
Oh.
I
think
we
ought
to
take
Mum
out
for
-
I
just
feel
we've
been
bad
sons
this
year.

Hurry
up,
big
boy!
I'm
naked
and
I
want
you
at
least
twice


I
am
so
happy
to
see
you!
-
Delicious
delicacy?
Taste
explosion?
-
Food?
Yeah,
a
bit
dodgy,
isn't
it?
Looks
like
a
dead
baby's
finger.
Oooh.
Oh.
Tastes
like
it,
too.
I'm
Colin,
by
the
way.
-
I'm
Nancy.
-
What
do
you
do,
Nancy?
-
Ever
do
weddings?
-
They
should've
asked
you
to
do
this
one.
-
God,
I
wish
you
hadn't
have
turned
it
down.

Right.
-
I've
worked
out
why
I
can't
find
true
love.
English
girls.
They're
stuck
up,
you
see.
And
I
am
primarily
attractive
to
girls
Like
American
girls.
I'd
get
a
girlfriend
there
instantly.
I
think
it's
crap,
Colin.
That's
where
you're
wrong.
American
girls
would
dig
me
-
You
don't
have
a
cute
British
accent.
Colin,
you're
a
lonely,
ugly
arsehole.
Never.
I
am
Colin,
God
of
Sex.
Bit
of
quiet
-
The
traffic
today
was
just...
Judy,
could
you
take
the
top
off
this
time?
Lighting
need
to
know
when
we're
gonna
Yes,
OK.
Right.
Not
always
the
case,
is
it?
I
was
standing
in
for
Brad
Pitt
once
-
Yes,
yeah.
Guys,
time's
tight
-
Fine.


Right,
let's
have
Can
you
just
put
your
hands
on
her
breasts?
-
OK,
yeah.
Is
that
all
right?
I'll
warm
them
up!
-
And
massage
them,
please.
It's
junction
13
that's
just
murder,
isn't
it?
Jo
and
I
had
a
lot
of
time
Some
of
her
requests,
for
instance,
that
I
should
bring
I
was
confident
she
expected
me
to
ignore.
But
others
she
was
pretty
damn
clear
about.
When
she
first
mentioned
I
said,
"Over
my
dead
body.
"
And
she
said,
"No,
Daniel,
over
mine.
"
And
as
usual,
my
darling
girl...
and
Sam's
darling
mum
was
right.
So
she's
going
to
say
her
final
farewell
inevitably,
ever
so
coolly,
through
the
immortal
genius

?
Goodbye
baby,
baby
bye
bye
?
Bye
bye
baby
?
Don't
make
me
cry
?
You're
the
one
girl
in
town
I'd
marry
?
Girl
I'd
marry
you
now
if
I
were
free
?
I
wish
it
could
be
?
I
could
love
you
but
why
begin
it?
?
Cos
there
ain't
any
future
in
it
?
She's
got
me
but
I'm
not
free
so...?

?
Goodbye
baby,
baby
bye
bye
?
Bye
bye
baby,
don't
make
me
cry
?
Goodbye
baby,
baby
bye
bye
?
Wish
I
never
had
known
you...?
Do
you
love
him?
Er,
er,
what?
No,
I-I
just
thought
I'd
ask
bluntly
and
you
needed
someone
to
talk
to
about
it
No.
No.
No
is
the
answer.
Absolutely
not.
?...
on
my
finger...?
So
that's
a
no,
then?
Yes.
Erm...
?
Bye
bye
baby,
baby
goodbye
?
Goodbye
baby,
baby
bye
bye...?
This
DJ,
what
do
you
reckon?
-
The
worst
in
history?
I
think
it
all
hangs
on
the
next
song.
Now
here's
one
for
the
lovers.
That's
quite
a
few
of
you,

?
And
they
called
it...?
-
He's
done
it,
it's
official.
?
Oh,
I
guess
they'll
never
know...?

Sarah's
waiting
for
you.
Oh,
yes,
of
course,
erm...
Great,
er,
good,
good.
How
are
you
doing,
Mia?
Absolutely.
-
Harry?
switch
off
your
phone
and
tell
me
exactly
Two
years,
seven
months,
three
days
and,
I
suppose,
what,
two
hours?
And
how
long
have
you
been
in
love
Um...
Two
years,
seven
months,
three
days
Thought
as
much.
-
Do
you
think
everybody
knows?
-
Do
you
think
Karl
knows?
Oh,
that
is...
that
is
bad
news.
I
just
thought
that
maybe
the
time
-
Like
what?
then
casually
mention
you'd
like
to
marry
-
You
know
that?
And
so
does
Karl.
Think
about
it,
for
all
our
sakes.
It's
Christmas.
Certainly.
Excellent.
Will
do.
Thanks,
boss.
-
Hi,
Sarah.


Babe.
Absolutely,
fire
away.
Mia,
Mia,
would
you
turn
that
down?
What
is
that?
That
was
the
Christmas
effort
Oh,
dear
me,
how
are
the
mighty
fallen.
I
can
safely
say
that
is
the
worst
record
Oh,
and
coincidentally,
on
my
friend
Mike's
show
Welcome
back,
Bill.
Billy,
welcome
back
to
the
airwaves.
New
Christmas
single,
Except
we've
changed
Yes,
is
that
an
important
message

Not
really,
Mike.
Christmas
is
a
time
for
people
-
And
that's
not
you?
When
I
was
young
and
successful,
and
now
I'm
left
with
no
one,
-
Wow.
Thanks
for
that,
Bill.
For
actually
giving
It
doesn't
often
happen
here
-
Ask
me
anything,
I'll
tell
you
the
truth.
-
Britney
Spears.
No,
only
kidding!

-
She
was
rubbish.
How
do
you
think
the
new
record
Come
on,
Mikey,
you
know
as
well
as
I
do

But
wouldn't
it
be
great
wasn't
some
smug
teenager
but
an
old
ex-heroin
addict
Those
young
popsters
come
Christmas
with
a
cute
bird
balancing
on
their
balls
and
I'll
be
stuck
in
some
dingy
flat
ugliest
man
in
the
world,
fucking
miserable
because
So
if
you
believe
in
Father
Christmas,
buy
my
festering
turd
of
a
record.
And
particularly
enjoy
of
the
moment
we
try
to
squeeze
I
think
you're
referring
to
"If
you
really
love
Christmas...
"
"Come
on
and
let
it
snow.
"
Ouch.
So,
here
it
is
one
more
time,
the
dark
horse
for
this
year's
Christmas
Is
All
Around.
Is
the
new
prime
minister
in
trouble
already?
?
I
feel
it
in
my
fingers
-
OK.
What's
next?
Ah,
yes,
yes.
I
fear
this
is
going
to
be
There's
a
strong
feeling
in
the
party
-
like
the
last
government.
This
is
our
first
really
important
test,
Right.
Right.
I
understand
that
not
to.
Not
this
time.
Let's
not
forget
that
America
I'm
not
going
to
act
like
a
petulant
child.
Who
do
you
have
to
screw
round
here
Right.

Yeah,
come
in.
-
These
are
from
the
Treasury...
...and
these
are
for
you.
Excellent.
Thanks
a
lot.
I
was
hoping
you'd
win,
not
that
just
always
given
him
the
boring
biscuits
Thanks
very
much.
Thanks...
Natalie.
God,
come
on,
get
a
grip.
So
what
do
you
reckon
Oh,
I
like
him.
I
can't
understand
You
know
the
type,
he's
married
to
his
job.
Either
that
or
gay
as
a
picnic
basket.
Excuse
me,
Judy,
if
you
could
-
and
cheat
them
a
bit
to
the
left?
I
have
to
say,
Judy,
this
is
a
real
pleasure,
it's
lovely
to
find
someone
-
Thank
you!
-
And
ditto.
The
move
again,
please,
Judy.
-
Ooh,
sorry.
-
Exciting
news!
I've
bought
a
ticket
to
the
States.
-
No.
-
To
a
fantastic
place
called
Wisconsin.
Yes!
Wisconsin
babes,
No,
Col!
There
are
a
few
babes
in
America,
but
they're
going
out
Tone,
you're
just
jealous.
You
know
perfectly
well
contains
ten
girls
more
beautiful
-
than
the
whole
of
the
United
Kingdom.
No,
I'm
wise.
Stateside
I
am
Prince
William
-
No,
Colin,
no!
-
Nyet!
-
Nein!
Right,
the
Christmas
party,
and
your
unhappy
job
to
organise.
-
Tell
me.
Find
a
venue,
over-order
on
the
drinks,
and
advise
the
girls
to
avoid
Kevin
-
Wives
and
family
and
stuff?
But
their
wives
and
girlfriends,
et
cetera.
Oh,
Christ,
you
haven't
got
some
horrible
No.
I'll
just
be
hanging
around
the
mistletoe,
Really?
Right.
He
now
spends
all
the
time
in
his
room.
-
That's
not
unusual.
My
horrid
son...
Bernard.
Stays
in
his
room
all
the
time.
Yeah,
but
Karen,
this
is
all
the
time.
I'm
afraid
that
there's
something
I
mean,
clearly
it's
about
his
mum
but
Christ,
he
might
be
injecting
heroin

At
the
age
of
11?

Well,
maybe
not
his
eyeballs,
then.
The
problem
is
his
mum
I
don't
know,
this
whole
stepfather
thing
like
it
never
did
before.
Listen,
it
was
always
going
to
be
Just
be
patient.
And
maybe
check
the
room
for
needles.
And
then
when
he
sometimes
does
It's
just
such
a
ridiculous
waste.
And
now
if
it's
going
to
ruin
I
just
don't
know.
Get
a
grip.
People
hate
sissies.
No
one's
ever
gonna
shag
you
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Helpful.
So,
what's
the
problem,
Samuel?
Is
it
just
Mum
or
is
it
something
else,
huh?
Maybe
school?
Are
you
being
bullied?
Or
is
it
something
worse?
Can
you
give
me
any
clues
at
all?
-
You
really
want
to
know?
Even
though
you
won't
be
able
to
help?
Even
if
that's
the
case,
yeah.
OK.
Well...
truth
is,
actually...
I'm
in
love.
Sorry?
I
know
I
should
be
thinking
I
was
before
she
died
-
Aren't
you
a
bit
young
to
be
in
love?
Ah,
well.
OK,
well...
I'm
a
little
relieved.
-
Why?
thought
it'd
be
something
worse.
Worse
than
the
total
agony
of
being
in
love?
Er...
No,
you're
right.
Total
agony.
-
Night,
Sarah.

Yeah,
absolutely.
Free
as
a
bird.
Fire
away.
Alone
again.
Naturally.
-
I'll
deal
with
it.
-
Ah.
Natalie.
Thanks.
Natalie.
Erm,
I'm
starting
to
feel...
uncomfortable
about
us
and
me
knowing
so
little
about
you,
Well,
there's
not
much
to
know.
Well,
erm,
where
do
you
live,
for
instance?
Wandsworth.
The
dodgy
end.
-
Ah,
my
sister
lives
in
Wandsworth.
So
which
exactly
is
the
dodgy
end?
At
the
end
of
the
high
street,
-
Oh,
yeah,
yeah,
that
is
dodgy.
Erm,
and
you
live
-
Three
illegitimate
but
charming
children?
I've
just
split
up
with
my
boyfriend,
so
-
Ah.
Sorry.
I'm
well
shot
of
him.
-
He
said
I
was
getting
fat.
He
said
no
one'd
fancy
a
girl
Not
a
nice
guy,
actually,
in
the
end.
No.
You
know,
erm...
being
Prime
Minister,
Thank
you,
sir.
I'll
think
about
it.
Do.
The
SAS
are
absolutely
charming.
Ruthless,
trained
killers
Oh,
God.
Did
you
have
this
kind
of
problem?
Yeah,
course
you
did,
you
saucy
minx.
So,
let's
go.
We
can
definitely
crack
this.
Remember,
I
was
a
kid
once,
too.
So,
come
on,
it's
someone
at
school.
Right?
-
Yeah.
And
what
does
she,
he,
feel
about
you?
SHE
doesn't
even
know
my
name.
And
even
if
she
did,
she'd
despise
me.
She's
the
coolest
girl
in
school.
And
everyone
worships
her
Good.
Good.
Well,
basically
you're
fucked,
aren't
you?

Hi
there
and
welcome
back.
So,
three
weeks
till
Christmas,
looks
like
I
saw
them
on
the
show
last
week.
No.
Little
scamps.
But
very,
very
talented
musicians.
Yeah.
I
understand
you've
got
a
prize
Yes,
I
have,
Ant
or
Dec.
It's
a
personalised
felt-tip
pen.
Oh,
great.
It's
brilliant.
It
even
writes
on
glass,
so
if
you've
got
a
framed
picture,
you
can
just
write
on
it.


Er,
a
lot
of
kids
watching,
Billy.
Hiya,
kids.
Here's
an
important
message
don't
buy
drugs.
Become
a
pop
star
And
I
do
believe
it's
a
commercial
break.
?
All
I
want
for
Christmas
is
you?
-
Look
at
him!
Eurh!
Actually,
they're
not
funny.
They're
art.

OK,
let's
say,
er,
Thursday,
my
place.
Great.
I've
got
Juliet
on
the
other
line,
-

OK,
fine.
-
I'm
always
nice.
-
I'm
always...
Hi.
How
was
the
honeymoon?
It
was
great.
-
So,
what
can
I
do
for
you?
I've
just
tried
the
wedding
video
-
'Lt's
come
out
all
blue
and
wibbly.
'
I
remember
you
filming
a
lot
To
be
honest,
I
didn't
really...
Please.
All
I
want
is
one
shot
of
me
I'll
have
a
look
but
I'm
pretty
sure
I
wiped
it,
-
'Must
go.
'
Any
progress
with
our
matchmaking
plans?
No.
I've
done
fuck-all
and
never
will
How
true.
-

Stop.
And
of
course,
your
mobile
goes.
Hello.
Hi.
How
you
doing?
-
So,
how's
the
Christmas
party
going?
Think
I've
found
a
venue.
-
What's
it
like?
It's
an
art
gallery.
Full
of
dark
corners
Oh.
Right.
Good.
Well,
I
suppose
I
should
You
should.


Ah,
bonjour,
Eleonore.
Bonjour,
Monsieur
Bennett.
Welcome
back.
And
this
year
you
bring
a
lady
guest?
No.
There's
a
change
of
situation.
Just
me.
-
Oh.
Am
I
sad
or
not
sad?
-
And
you
stay
here
till
Christmas?
Good.
Well,
I
find
you
This
is
Aurelia.
Ah.
-
Er,
bonjour,
Aurelia.

Er,
je
suis,
er,
trs
heureux
Unfortunately,
she
cannot
speak
French,
She's
Portuguese.

Ah,
ah,
buongiorno.
Eusebio,
er,
er...

Er,
molto
bueno...
I
think
she's
ten
years
too
young
And
"molto
bueno"
is
Spanish.
Right.
Anyway,
it's
nice
to
meet
you
and...
Can
you
drive
her
home
after
her
work?
Oh,
absolutely,
yes.
Which
is
what?
Turkish?

Bello.
Er,
bella.
Er,
mon-montagno,
arvarez...
No,
right.
Silence
is
golden.
As
the
Tremeloes
said.
Clever
guys,
although
I
think
the
original
version
was
Gr-great
band.
(?
High-pitched
humming:
Oh,
shut
up.


Mr
President!
-
Over
here,
sir!
Mr
President,
welcome.
It's
a
pleasure
to
meet
you.
Come
through.
So
is
she.
Although
she
would
have
been
Yes.
Pathetic,
isn't
it?
Just
never
been
able
to
tie
a
girl
down.
Not
sure
that
politics
and
dating
go
together.
Really?
I've
never
found
that.
Yeah,
you're
still
sickeningly
handsome,
-
Very
jealous
of
your
plane,
by
the
way.
Ah,
Natalie.
Hi.
Morning,
ma'am.
How's
your
day
so
far?
-


My
goodness,
Did
you
see
those
pipes?
Yeah,
she's
terrific.
At
her
job.
No,
absolutely
not.
We
cannot
That
is
unexpected.
Well,
it
shouldn't
be.
The
last
administration
We're
being
consistent
with
their
policies.
With
all
respect,
they
were
bad
policies.
Thanks,
Alex.
I
don't
think
Let's,
erm...
move
on,
shall
we?
Well,
now,
that
was
an
interesting
day.
Sorry
if
our
line
was
firm
but
there's
then
just
disappointing
you
for
four
years.
I
have
plans
and
I
plan
to
see
them
through.
Absolutely.
It's
very
close
to
my
heart.
I'll
give
you
anything
you
ask
for.
As
long
as
it's
not
something
Hi.
Pathetic.
It's
great
Scotch.
I'll,
erm...
I'll
be
going,
then.
Er,
Natalie,
I
hope
to
see
much
more
of
you
Thank
you,
sir.
Er,
yes,
Peter.
Mr
President,
has
it
been
a
good
visit?
Very
satisfactory
indeed.
We
got
what
we
came
for
and
our
special
relationship
Prime
Minister?
I
love
that
word
"relationship".
I
fear
that
this
has
become
A
relationship
based
on
and
casually
ignoring
all
those
things
Britain.
We
may
be
a
small
country
The
country
of
Shakespeare,
-
Sean
Connery,
Harry
Potter.
-
David
Beckham's
right
foot.
David
Beckham's
left
foot,
come
to
that.
And
a
friend
who
bullies
us
And
since
bullies
only
respond
to
strength,
I
will
be
prepared
to
be
much
stronger.
And
the
President

Mr
President!
Joe.
It's
your
sister
on
line
four.
All
right.
Er,
yes,
I'm
very
busy
Have
you
gone
completely
insane?
-
You
can't
always
be
sensible.
-
It's
the
Chancellor
on
the
other
line.
-
'I'll
call
you
back.
'
The
trouble
with
being
the
Prime
Minister's
What
did
my
brother
do
today?
What
did
I
do?
What
is
this
we're
listening
to?
Joni
Mitchell.
I
can't
believe
you
still
listen
to
Joni
Mitchell.
I
love
her
and
true
love
lasts
a
lifetime.
Joni
Mitchell
is
the
woman
who
taught
Did
she?
Oh,
well,
that's
good,
Which
doll
for
Daisy's
friend
Emily?
The
one

looks
like

transvestite

almost
enough

If
you
want

for

Jump
in

And
feel
my
touch

you
wanna
taste

Jump
for
my
love

I'll
take
you
down,
I'll
take
you
down

gone?

Mary,
can
we
move
the
Japanese
-
Certainly,
sir.
Erm.
Would
you
like
the
last,
er?

Thank
you
very
much
but
no.
If
you
saw
my
sister,
you'd
understand
why.
That's
all
right,
more
for
me.

you're
getting
chubbier
every
day.
I'm
very
lucky
I've
got
a
constitution

-
Hello.
Oop.
Sorry.

Hello?
-
Thank
you.
-
Eu
peo
imensa
desculpa.
-
God,
it's
half
the
book.
Oh,
no.
Just
leave
them,
please!
They're
not
worth
it!
Stop!
Stop.
Aa-ahh.
It's
all
just
rubbish.
Just
leave
it.
Oh,
God,
she's
in.
And
now
she'll
think
I'm
a
total
spaz

Fuck
-
it's
cold!
Fuck
-
it's
freezing!
Fuck!

This
stuff
better
be
good.
It's
not
worth
it,

I
don't
want
to
drown
saving
some
shit
my
grandmother
Just
stop.
Stop.

What
kind
of
idiot
I
really
must
do
copies.
There'd
better
not
be
eels
in
here.

Try
not
to
disturb
the
eels.
Oh,
what
the
hell
is
that?
Thank
you.
Thank
you
so
much.
I
know.
I'll
name

Maybe
you
could
name
Or
give
me
50/o
of
the
profits.
Or
I
could
give
you
5/o
of
the
profits.

What
kind
of
book
is
it?
-
Romance?
It's,
erm...
Ah,
er...

Thriller...
crime...

Sim.

Er,
scary?
Yes,
sometimes
scary.
And,
er,
sometimes
not.
Mm.

I'd
better
get
back
to
work.
-
Ah.
Sure.
It's
my
favourite
time
of
day...
driving
you.

It's
the
saddest
part
Sorry.

'And
coming
up
?
There's
no
beginning,
there'll
be
no
end

?
Cos
on
Christmas...
'here
at
10:30.
Do
not
switch
off.
'
Banoffee
pie?
No,
thanks.
Thank
God.
You
would've
broken
my
heart
Right,
well,
lucky
you.
-
Can
I
come
in?
I
was
just
passing
and
I
thought
I
thought
I
might
be
able
or
maybe
Munchies?
Actually,
I
was
serious
-
I
don't
know
Mark,
can
I
say
something?
Yeah.
I
know
you're
Peter's
best
friend
and
I
know
you've
never
Look,
don't,
don't
argue.
We've
never
got
friendly.
But
I
wanted
to
say,
I
hope
that
can
change.
I'm
nice.
I
really
am.
It
would
be
great
if
we
could
be
friends.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Great.
Doesn't
mean
we'll
be
able
I
had
a
real
search
when
you
first
called
This
one
says
Do
you
think
we
might
be
on
the
right
track?
Er,
yeah,
well...
Wow.
That-that
could
be
it.
-
Do
you
mind
if
I?
Almost
everything's
episodes
of
West
Wing.
Oh.
Oh,
bingo.
That's
lovely.
Well
done,
you.
Oh,
that's
gorgeous.
Thank
you
so
much,
Mark,
I
look
quite
pretty.
You've
stayed
rather
close.
They're
all
of
me.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
But...
you
never
talk
to
me.
You
always
talk
to
Peter.
You
don't
like
me.
I
hope
it's
useful.
Don't
show
it
around
too
much.
Needs
a
bit
of
editing.
Look,
I've
got
to
get
to
a...
lunch.
Early
lunch.
You
can
just
show
yourself
out,
can't
you?
It's
a...
self-preservation
thing,
you
see.

?
Oh
I
am
what
I
am
?
I'll
do
what
I
want
?
But
I
can't
hide
?
And
I
won't
go
?
I
won't
sleep
?
And
I
can't
breathe
?
Until
you're
resting
here
with
me
?
And
I
won't
leave
?
And
I
can't
hide
?
I
cannot
be
?
Until
you're
resting
here
?
And
I
won't
go
?
And
I
won't
sleep
?
And
I
can't
breathe
?
Until
you're
resting
here
with
me?
-

Annie,
my
darling,
my
dream,
my
boat.
Ah...
-
Need
you
to
do
a
favour
for
me.
Anything
for
the
hero
of
the
hour.
Don't
ask
me
why,
it's
just
a
weird
personality
thing.
But,
erm,
you
know
Natalie
who
works
here?
The
chubby
girl?
Ooh,
would
we
call
her
chubby?
I
think
there's
a
pretty
sizeable
arse
there,
Yeah.
Well,
whatever,
erm...
I'm
sure
she's
a
lovely
girl
redistribute
her?
It's
done.
Hey,
Sammo.
Can't
sleep?
I
got
some
terrible
news
today.
Let's
have
it.
-
Joanna's
going
back
to
America.
Yes,
she's
American.
And
she's
not
my
girl.
And
she's
going
back
to
America.
That
is
bad
news.
Well,
we
need
Kate
and
we
need
Leo,
and
we
need
them
now.
Come
on.
'Hold
on.
Hold
on.
'Keep
your
eyes
closed.
-
'Do
you
trust
me?
'
-
Do
you
trust
me?
-
Fool!
'All
right,
open
your
eyes.
'
You
know,
Sammy,
but
general
wisdom
is
that
in
the
end,
there
isn't
just
one
person
for
each
of
us.
There
was
for
Kate
and
Leo.
There
was
for
you.
And
there
is
for
me.
She's
the
one.
Fair
enough.
And
her
name's
Joanna?
Yeah,
I
know.
Same
as
Mum.
-

-
Prime
Minister.

Grande,
er...
grande
familio,
Stupido.
Well,
goodbye.

Thank
you.
Erm,
it
was,
erm...

I
will
miss
you.
And
your
very
slow
typing...
and
your
very
bad
driving.

?
You
know
I
love
Christmas,
I
always
will
?
My
mind's
made
up,
the
way
that
I
feel
?
There's
no
beginning,
there'll
be
no
end
?
Cos
on
Christmas
you
can
depend?
Daniel!
-
I
have
a
plan.
-
Well,
girls
love
musicians,
don't
they?
-
Even
the
weird
ones
get
girlfriends.
Meat
Loaf
definitely
got
laid
at
least
once.
For
God's
sake,
Whatever.
There's
this
big
concert
I
thought
if
I
was
in
the
band
she
might
fall
in
love
with
me.
I
think
it's
brilliant,
I
think
it's
stellar.
Apart
from
the
one
obvious
-
I
don't
play
a
musical
instrument?
A
tiny,
insignificant
detail.


?
I
go
out
of
my
mind
?
I
can't
see
anything
?
Cos
this
love's
got
me
blind
?
I
can't
help
myself
?
I
can't
break
this
spell
?
I
can't
even
try
?
Baby,
I'm
too
lost
in
you
?
Caught
in
you
?
Lost
in
everything
about
you
?
So
deep
I
can't
sleep,
I
can't...?
I
suppose
I'd
better
do
the
duty
round.
You're
a
saint.

Any
chance
of
a
dance
with
the
boss?
Yeah,
sure,
sure.
As
long
as
your
boyfriend
doesn't
mind.
Not
my
boyfriend.
?
And
you're
all
I
see
?
And
you're
all
I
need
?
Help
me,
baby
?
Help
me,
baby
?
Oh
baby,
I'm
too
lost
in
you
?
Caught
in
you...?
You're
looking
very
pretty
tonight.
It's
for
you.
Sorry?
It's
all
for
you,
sir.
?
You
do
?
I'm
too
lost
in
you
?
Baby,
I'm
too
lost
in
you
?
Caught
in
you
?
Lost
in
everything
about
you
?
So
deep
I
can't
sleep?
'This
must
be
very
exciting
for
you,
-
'How's
it
looking
so
far?
'
'Blue
are
outselling
me
five
to
one
'but
I'm
hoping
for
a
late
surge.
'And,
if
I
reach
number
one,
'I
promise
to
sing
a
song
stark
naked
-
'Do
you
mean
that?
'
'Do
you
want
a
preview?
You
old
flirt.
'

'That'll
never
make
number
one.
'

?
And
I
burn
every
track
I
suppose
it's
his
job
Some
more
than
others.
Just
one
dance?
-
Before
we
run
out
of
chances.
-
Unless
you
just...
Yes.
Thanks.
?
You're
a
good
girl
?
Late
at
night
I
talk
to
you
?
Hey
?
You
will
know
the
difference
when...?


?
Like
a
flower
?
Waiting
to
bloom
?
Like
a
light
bulb
?
In
a
dark
room
?
I'm
just
sitting
here
?
Waiting
for
you
?
To
come
on
home
?
And
turn
me
on
?
Like
the
desert
?
Waiting
for
the
rain
?
Like
a
schoolkid
?
Waiting
for
the
spring
?
I'm
just
sitting
here
?
Waiting
for
you
to
come
on
home
?
And
turn
me
on
?
Turn
me
on?
Well,
then.
I'd
better
go.
OK.
-
Good
night.
Actually...
-
I
don't
have
to
go.
-
I
mean...
Just,
erm,
would
you
excuse
me
-
Sure.
Erm,
OK,
that's
done.
Erm...
Why
don't
you
come
upstairs
-
Ten
seconds.

?
For
you
?
There'll
be
no
crying
?
For
you
?
The
sun
will
be
shining
?
Cos
I
feel
that
when
I'm
with
you
?
It's
all
right...?
-
Just
tug
it.
?
I
know
it's
right
?
And
the
songbirds
?
Keep
singing
like
they
know
the
score
?
And
I
love
you,
I
love
you,
I
love
you...?
You're
beautiful.
?
Like
never
before...?

L-
I'd
better
answer
that.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello,
darling.
No,
no,
I'm
not
busy.
No,
fire
away.
Right.
Yes,
I...
I'm
not
quite
sure
to
get
the
Pope
on
the
phone
tonight
but...
Yes.
Yes,
I'm
sure
he's
very
good
Well,
I'm
sure...
Jon
Bon
Jovi
is
as
well
OK?
OK,
I'll
talk
to
you
later.
All
right,
bye-bye.
-
Sorry
about
that.
It's
my
brother,
he's
not
well,
he
calls
a
lot.
-
I'm
sorry.
I
mean,
it's
not
really
fine,
it
is
what
it
is,
and
there
being
no
parents
now
it's
my
job
to
keep
an
eye
on
him.
That's
OK.
Life
is
full
So...

Will
it
make
him
better?
No.
Then
maybe...
don't
answer.
Hey.
How
you
doing?
Right,
right.
Oh,
no,
please.
Oh,
please,
please
don't,
little
darling.
Between
the
two
of
us
we'll
find
the
answer
No,
no.
I'm-I'm
not
busy.
I...
Of
course,
if
you
want
me
OK.
That
was
a
good
night.
-
Except
I
felt
fat.
It's
true.
Nowadays
the
only
clothes
I
can
get
into
I
always
think
Pavarotti
dresses
very
well.
Mia's
very
pretty.
Is
she?
You
know
she
is,
darling.
Be
careful
there.
Have
you
been
watching
stuff
on
TV?
Yeah.
-
Every
night.
And
every
day.
-
The
nurses
are
trying
to
kill
me.
Thank
you.
Don't
do
that,
my
darling.
Thank
you.
Don't
do
that.

Right.
Back
at
three.
Christmas
shopping,
Are
you
gonna
get
me
something?
Er...
I
don't
know,
I
hadn't
thought.
Where's
Sarah,
by
the
way?
She
couldn't
make
it
in.
Family
thing.
There's
a
word
for
hangover
-
See
you
later.
A
lot.
Are
you
gonna
give
me
something?
I
thought
I
made
it
clear
last
night.
When
it
comes
to
me,
So,
erm,
what
do
you
need?
Something
along
the
stationery
line?
No.
I
don't
want
something
I
need.
I
want
something
I
want.
Something
pretty.
Right.
Right.
Sorry
I'm
late,
I
had
to
drop
off
Right,
listen,
you
keep
yourself
occupied
while
I
do
the
boring
stuff
for
our
mothers.
-
Thank
you.
Looking
for
anything
in
particular,
sir?
Yes.
That
necklace
there,
how
much
is
it?
It's
270.
-
Erm,
all
right.
Er,
I'll
have
it.
Would
you
like
it...
giftwrapped?
-
Yes,
all
right.
Let
me
just
pop
it
in
the
box.
There.
-
Look,
could
we
be
quite
quick?
Ready
in
the
flashiest
of
flashes.
-
There.
Not
quite
finished.
-
I
don't
need
a
bag,
I'll
put
it
in
my
pocket.
-
Really?
Ooh!
Could
we
be
quite
quick,
please?
Prontissimo.
-
What's
that?
-
Actually,
I
really
can't
wait.
Want
to
bet?
'Tis
but
the
work
of
a
moment.
There
we
go.
Almost
finished.
Are
you
gonna
dip
it
in
yogurt?
No,
sir,
we're
going
to
pop
it
I
don't
want
a
Christmas
box.
-
But
you
wanted
it
giftwrapped.
-
The
final
flourish.
-
All
we
need
now...
...is
a
sprig
of
holly.
-
No
bloody
holly.
-
Leave
it.

to

out
my
flat

pay
for
my

You're
not
actually
going
ahead
I
bloody
am.
You
think
this
is
full
of
clothes?
It
is
chock-a-block
full
of
condoms.
Excellent.
Excellent.

Look,
erm...
sorry
to
be
a
bit
forward
and
all
that
but...
you
don't
fancy
going
for
a
Christmas
drink,
Just
maybe
go
and
see
something
Obviously,
if
you
don't
want
to,
I'm
rambling
now,
sorry.
No.
That
would
be
lovely.
Oh,
great.
Yay!
You
know,
that
is
really
great.
Normally,
I'm
really
shy,
takes
me
ages

again
why
you're
so
late.
We've
been
waiting
for

What
the
hell
are
you
doing
here?
Well,
I
was
there
for
a
minute
or
two
-
Really?
Come
on.
Just
come
up.
So
what
was
this
epiphany?
Erm,
it...
it
was
about
Christmas.
You
realised
it
was
all
around.
No.
I
realised
that
Christmas
is
the
time

And
I
realised
that,
as
dire
chance
here
I
am,
mid-fifties,
and
without
knowing
it,
with
a
chubby
employee.

And,
much
as
it
grieves
me
to
say
it,
it
might
be
that
the
people
I
love
is,

you.

is
a
surprise.
Yeah.

minutes
at
Elton
John's
and
you're
gay?
No,
look.

serious
here.
I
left
Elton's
and
a
hefty
number
in
order
to
hang
out
with
you
at
Christmas.
-
Well,
Bill...
but
you
turn
out
to
be
And
to
be
honest,
we
have
had
a
wonderful
life.
Well...
thank
you.
I
mean,
come
on,
it's
been
an
honour.

feel
very
proud.

don't
be
a
moron.

on,

fucking
coat?

is

mum
and
my
dad

erm...
this
is

Prime
Minister.
Yes,
we
can
see
that,
darling.
And
erm,
unfortunately,
we're
very
late.
It's
the
school
Christmas
concert,
All
the
local
schools
have
joined
together,
-
Too
much
detail,
Mum.
Well,
I...
just
needed
Natalie...
on
some
state
business.
-
Oh.
Right,
er...
Well,
perhaps
you
should
Er,
Natalie.
I
don't
want
to
make
you
late
for
the
concert.
-
No,
it's
nothing,
really.
-
No,
really,
it
doesn't
matter.
Eight
is

lot
of
legs,
David.
Mm.
Erm...
Listen,
why
don't
I
give
you
a
lift
and
then
we
can
talk
about
OK.
-
Lovely,
yes.
Hold
tight,
everybody.
-
How
far
is
this
place?
Ah,
right.
Well,
er...
I
just
wanted
to
say...
thank
you
for
the
Christmas
card.
You're
welcome.
Look,
I'm
so
sorry
about
that
day.
I
came
in
and
he
slinked
towards
me
and
he's
the
President
of
the
United
States
I
just
felt
like
such
a
fool
because...
I
think
about
you
all
the
time,
actually.
-
And
I
think
you're
the
man
that
I
really...
...love.
That
really
was
just
round
the
corner.
Er...
Erm...
Ow!

Well,
look,
I...
I
think
I'd
better
not
come
in,
you
know?
Nobody
wants
some
politician
No,
please
come.
It'll
be
great.
No,
I'd...
I'd
better
not.
But
I
will
be
very
sorry
to
drive
away
from
you.
Just
give
me
one
second.
John's
been
very
mysterious.
-
Erm...
erm...
No!
Come
on
in.
We
can
watch
from
backstage.
OK.
Terry,
I
won't
be
long.
Look,
this
has
to
be
a
very
secret
visit,
OK?
Don't
worry.
This
was
my
school.
Look,
the
sheep
are
ready
already
-
Oh,
David.
Oh,
how
are
you?
Hi,
guys.
Hey,
hey,
hey.
You
all
right?
What
the
hell
are
you
doing
here?
-
Well,
you
know...
that
these
things
are
going
on
but
it
never
I
thought
it
was
time
I
did.
I
didn't
want
anyone
to
see,
Good
luck,
Daisy,
good
luck,
Bernie.
I've
never
been
gladder
-
Thank
you.
Oh,
now.
We
haven't
been
introduced.
Right.
Well,
this
is
Gavin.
-
Hello,
Gavin.
And
this
is
Natalie,
who's
my,
erm...
-
who's
my,
erm,
catering
manager.
-
Hi.
Watch
he
keeps
his
hands
off
you.
20
years
ago,
you'd
have
been
his
type.
I'll
be
very
careful.
Don't
try
something,
sir,
-
No,
seriously.
Come
on.
Showtime.
Quickly.
-
Look,
see
you
after,
yeah?
-
Thank
you,
Prime
Minister.
-
Come
on.

So

And

sound
of
children's
laughter

Laughter

Everyone

I

Right.
So,
not
quite
as
secret
as
we'd
hoped.
-
What
do
we
do
now?
Little
bow.
And
a
wave.
Absolutely
no
idea.
I'll
see
you
later,
all
right?
I'll
speak
to
you.
Bye.
Tell
me,
if
you
were
in
my
position,
What
position
is
that?
Lmagine
your
husband
and,
come
Christmas,
-
Oh,
Karen...
-
Good
night.
Would
you
wait
around
to
find
out
or
if
it's
sex
and
a
necklace
or
if,
worst
of
all,
it's
a
necklace
and
love?
Would
you
stay?
Knowing
life
-
Or
would
you
cut
and
run?
I
am
so
in
the
wrong.
A
classic
fool.
Yes,
but
you've
also
made
a
fool
out
of
me.
You've
made
the
life
I
lead
foolish,
too.
Darling.
Ooh,
darlings!
Oh,
you
were
wonderful.
My
little
lobster,
you
were
so...
What
is
that
word?
Orange.
Come
on,
I've
got
treats
at
home.
Sammy!
Fantastic
show!
-
Thanks.
Plan
didn't
work,
though.
-
Tell
her
what?
No
way.
Anyway,
they
fly
tonight.
Even
better.
Sam,
you've
got
nothing
to
lose
I
never
told
your
mum
enough.
I
should
have
told
her
every
day
You've
seen
the
films,
kiddo.
OK,
Dad.
Let's
do
it.
Let's
go
get
the
shit
Yes.
-
Just
give
me
one
sec.
-
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
That's
OK.
-
My
fault.
You're
Sam's
dad,
aren't
you?
Yeah.
Stepdad,
actually.
-
Daniel.
Carol.
-
OK,
I'm
back.
Let's
go.
I
hope
we'll
meet
again,
Karen.
Carol.

-
I'll
make
sure
we
do.

-
Tell
her.
-
You
know...
-
Look,
there
she
is.
Over
there.
Oh,
no.
It's
OK,
we'll
go
to
the
airport.

Good
evening.
-
Senhor
Barros?
I
am
here
to
ask
your
daughter
for
her
hands
in
marriage.
You
want
to
marry
my
daughter?
Yes.
Come
here,
there
is
a
man
at
the
door.
He
wants
to
marry
you.
But
I've
never
seen
him
before.
Who
cares?
You're
going
to
sell
me
Sell?
Who
said
sell?
I'll
pay
him.
Pardon
me.
I'm
meaning
She's
not
here
-
she's
at
work.
I'll
take
you.
You!
Stay
here.
As
if
I
would.
Stupid!
Father
is
about
to
sell
Aurelia
Wait.
Wait.
Oh,
no.
You
better
not
say
yes,
Father.
Shut
up,
Miss
Dunkin'
Donut
2003.
-
Look,
we're
not
actually
flying.
Not
even
to
let
the
boy
say
goodbye
No.
-
I'm
sorry,
Sam.
Just
a
moment,
I
know
I've
got
it.
-
Unless...
-
Do
you
want
to
make
a
run
for
it?
-
You
think
I
should?
-
OK.
I
must
have
left
them



Apparently
he
is
going
to
kill
Aurelia.
Cool!
Joanna.
Sam?
-
I
thought
you
didn't
know
my
name.
Oh,
Jesus.
Here,
I've
gotta
run.
-

Where
is
Aurelia?
This
man
wants
to
marry
her.
He
can't
do
that
-
she's
our
best
waitress.
Boa
noite,
Aurelia.
Boa
noite,
Jamie.
Beautiful
Aurelia...
I've
come
here
with
a
view
to
asking
you...
to
marriage
me.
I
know
I
seems
an
insane
person
but
sometimes
things
are
so
transparency,
they
don't
need
evidential
proof.
And
I
will
inhabit
here,
Definitely
go
for
England,
girl.
You'll
meet
Prince
William
-
Of
course
I
don't
expecting
you
and
of
course
I
prediction
you
say
no...
but
it's
Christmas
Oh,
God
-
say
yes,
you
skinny
moron.

Thank
you.
That
will
be
nice.
Yes
is
being
my
answer.
Easy
question.

What
did
you
say?
Yes,
of
course.

Bravo!

You
learned
English?
Just
in
cases.

?
I
may
not
always
love
you
?
But
long
as
there
are
stars
above
you...?
Hello,
Daisy.
-
This
one's
Greta.
?
I'll
make
you
so
sure
about
it...?
Here
she
is.
This
is
Aurelia.
-
Mark,
didn't
see
you
there.
Jamie's
friends
are
so
good-looking.
He
never
tells
me
this.
I
think
maybe
now
picked
wrong
Englishman.
She
can't
speak
English
properly.

Dad!
Dad!
Oh,
God.
-
Did
you
get
us
any
presents?

Thanks,
Dad.
-
How
are
you?
Good
to
have
you
back.
Come
on.
Home.
There
she
is.
-
Hi.
-
Aw,
he
should
have
kissed
her.
-
All
right?
-
I
might
get
a
shag
at
last.
-
Got
to
go.
Yahoo!
Now,
this
is
Harriet.
-
Hi.
Really
pleased
to
meet
you.
I
hope
you
don't
mind,
This
is
Carla.
She's
real
friendly.
Hello,
you
must
be
Tony.
I
heard
you
were
gorgeous.

Love
can
be
a
many
splendored
thing
?
Can't
deny
the
joy
it
brings
?
A
dozen
roses,
diamond
rings
?
Dreams
for
sale
and
fairy
tales
?
It'll
make
you
hear
a
symphony
?
And
you
just
want
the
world
to
see
?
But
like
a
drug
that
makes
you
blind
?
It'll
fool
ya
every

The
trouble
with
love
is

It

tear
you
up

See

no

Now
I
was
once
a
fool,
it's
true

I
played
the
game
by
all
the
rules
?
But
now
my
world's
a
deeper
blue
?
I'm
sadder
but
I'm
wiser
too
?
I
swore
I'd
never
love
again
?
I
swore
my
heart
would
never
mend

Said
love
wasn't
worth
the
pain

my
