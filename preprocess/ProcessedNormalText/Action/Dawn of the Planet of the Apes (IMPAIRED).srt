Caesar...
They
are
close.
Koba!

Now,

Son,
stay...
















Thank
you,
Koba.
Think
before
you
act,
son.



Don't
feel
bad,
Blue
Eyes...
Scars
make
you
strong.







Come
meet
your
new
brother.
Another
son.

Makes
me
think
how
far
we've
come,
Seems
long
ago.

Still
think
about
them?
Humans?
Sometimes.
Didn't
know
them
like
you
did.
Only
saw
their
bad
side.
Good,
bad...
doesn't
matter
now.
Humans
destroyed
each
other.
Apes
fight
too.
But
we
are
family.
Wonder
if
they're
really
all
gone.
Ten
winters
now...
Last
two...
no
sign
of
them.
They
must
be
gone.

That

I'm
quick!
Shut
up,
Ash!

Shh.
Oh,
God.
It's
okay.
Shh.

It's
okay.
It's
okay.
Freeze!





Stay!
Help!
Help!
No!
Hey!
Over
here!
I
shot
him!
I
shot
him.





They
shot
Ash!
Shot
my
son!
Rocket,
wait...
We
don't
mean
any
harm!

They're
apes,
man.
You
think
they
understand
Do
they
look
like
just
apes
to
you?

Dad.
ALEXANDER:
-
Dad?
It's
okay.
Put
your
guns
down.
-
You
can't
be
serious.
Go!
Holy
shit.
Holy
shit.

Okay.
Okay,
we're
going.
Go!
-
Slowly.
Go,
go,
go!
My
bag!
Go!


Koba!
Follow!



Did
you
find
it?
We
need
to
talk.
What?
What's
wrong?
The,
um...
The
dam
is
pretty
much
intact.
It
could
probably
start
But
there
is
a
problem.
Get
in.

CARVER:
I
shot
him.
I
was
scared.
I
didn't
know
what
to
do.
Jesus
Christ.
How
many
were
there?
A
lot.
Like,
80.
-
At
least.
you're
not
hearing
what
he's
saying.
That
is
not
possible.
I'm
telling
you,
Dreyfus,
Incredible?
They're
talking
apes!
-
With
big-ass
spears!
I
don't
know
exactly
but
you
have
to
calm
down,
okay?
What
about
the
virus,
Ellie?
We're
all
genetically
immune
You
don't
know
that
for
sure.
She
worked
with
the
CDC.
She
knows.
What
are
we
gonna
do?
I
don't
know.
We
need
that
power.
He
could've
killed
us,
but
he
didn't.
Maybe
he
kept
us
alive,
They
find
out
where
we
are,
What
do
you
mean,
"he"?
That's
what
we're
trying
to
tell
you.
It
was
unlike
anything
He
was
remarkable.
CARVER:
Really?
-
Is
that
what
you
thought?
Yeah,
it's
what
we
all
saw.
Not
a
word
of
this
back
at
the
colony,
Not
a
word
until
You
gotta
be
kidding.
No,
I'm
not
kidding.
I
don't
want
to
create
a
panic.
How
are
you
doing,
pal?
Are
you
okay?
-
I
dropped
my
bag.
-
Was
your
sketchbook
in
there?
Carver
just
told
me
we're
not
gonna
Not
yet.
No.


Must
attack
them
now!
Before
they
attack
us!
We
don't
know
how
many
there
are.
How
many
guns
they
have?
Or
why
they
came
up
here?


They
shot
your
son,
Rocket!
Don't
you
want
to
fight?
I
follow
Caesar.
Koba's
right!
They
almost
killed
you,
Ash!
No!
If
we
go
to
war...
We
could
lose
all
we've
built...
Home.
Family.
Future.

I
will
decide
by
morning.
KOBA:
Caesar.
For
years
I
was
a
prisoner
in
their
lab...
They
cut
me...
Tortured
me.
You
freed
me.
I
would
do
anything
you
ask.
But
we
must
show
strength!
We
will,
Koba.



Coming
through.
Coming
through.


That's
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
than
eighty!

Malcolm!
Apes...
do
not
want
war...
but
will
fight...
if
we
must.
Ape
home.
Human
home.
Do
not
come
back.





Everyone!
Everyone,
you
have
to
calm
down!

Everybody.
Everybody!
Please!
We're
all
immune!
We're
all
immune,
MAN:
How
did
they
find
us?

We
found
them.
MAN:
You
knew
they
were
out
there!
WOMAN:
What
if
they
come
back?
ALL:
Yeah!
If
they
come
back...
If
they
come
back...
they'll
be
sorry
they
ever
did!
Now,
this
city
may
not
have
but
it
has
the
firepower.
Those
stockpiles
left
behind...
by
FEMA,
the
National
Guard,
we
have
it
all.
Look...
I
know
why
you're
scared.
I'm
scared,
too,
believe
me.
But
I
recognize
the
trust
We've
been
through
hell
together.
But
you
all
know
what
we're
up
against.
We're
almost
out
of
fuel.
Which
means
no
more
power...
which
means
we
could
slip
back
That
dam
up
there
was
the
answer.
We
just
had
no
idea
they
were
up
there,
too.
So,
what
do
we
do
now?
ALL:
Yeah!
We
find
another
way...
because
that
power...
is
not
just
about
keeping
the
lights
on.
It's
about
giving
us
the
tools...
to
reconnect
to
the
rest
of
the
world.
To
find
out
who
else
is
out
there...
so
that
we
can
start
to
rebuild...
and
reclaim...
the
world
we
lost.

That
was
a
great
speech.
There
is
no
alternative
power
source.
That
dam
is
the
only
option.
Well,
then,
we
fight
them.
We're
two
weeks
away
Maybe
three,
tops.
I
know.
And
once
that
happens...
I
won't
be
able
to
go
out
and
calm
everybody
down.
We
need
that
power
It's
our
only
chance
We
have
to
find
other
survivors.
Yeah.
There's
not
that
many
of
us
left.
We
can't
afford
any
more
casualties.
We
founded
this
place...
-
you
and
I...
On
the
idea
that
power
If
we
can't
stick
together,
I
lost
everything.
The
idea
of
losing
what
little
I
have
is...
I
want
to
go
back
up
there.
Listen
to
me.
Give
me
three
days.
Let
me
talk
to
him.
And
what
if
it
backfires?
I
mean,
how
do
you
know
He's
more
than
just
an
ape.
I'm
gonna
take
some
men
up
to
Fort
Point.
I'm
gonna
go
through
the
armory.
I'm
gonna
see
what's
still
working.
Three
days.
You're
not
back
in
three
days...
we're
going
up
there,
Carver
is
getting
the
trucks
ready.
He'll
be
here
with
Foster
and
Kemp
You're
really
taking
Carver?
I
mean,
he
shot
one
of
them.
I
don't
really
have
any
choice.
He
used
to
work
at
the
water
department.
He's
the
only
one
Malcolm...
what
are
you
gonna
do
up
there?
What
are
you
gonna
say?
I'll
tell
him
the
truth.
Hope
I
catch
him
in
a
good
mood.
You
think
I'm
crazy.
I'm
worried.
Yeah,
so
am
I.
I've
gone
over
it
in
my
head...
and
I
think
if
I
don't
at
least
try
this...
there's
gonna
be
a
war.
Take
me
with
you.
What
if
someone
gets
hurt?

I
love
you.
But
I
need
you
to
stay
here.
I
don't
want
Alexander
to
be
alone.
ALEXANDER:
I'm
coming,
too.
Son,
it's
not
safe.
But
I'm
safer
with
you
than
I
am
down
here.
I'm
coming.
Please.
MALCOLM:
No
one
gets
out
of
the
trucks.
No
one.
If
I'm
not
back
in
two
hours,
you
get
everyone
back
to
the
city.
It's
gonna
be
okay.










Oh,
please.
Please.
Please.

Please
don't
kill
me.
Just
hear
what
I
have
to
say.
I
know.
"Don't
come
back."
I
know.
I
wouldn't
be
here
unless
it
were...

Okay!
Okay!
Okay!
Okay,
okay,
okay.
I
need
to
show
you
something.
It's
not
far.
Human
lies!

No,
no,
no.
I
swear.

If
I
could
just
show
you,

Please.

Show
me.
This
is
what
we
used
to
call
a
"small
hydro."
It
was
built
to
service
areas
but
we've
been
working
because
the
city
used
to
run
off
nuclear
So,
we've
been
using
But
if
we
can
just
get
this
dam
working...
then
we
have
a
shot
Is
any
of
this
making
any
sense
to
you?
The...
lights.
Yes.
The
lights.
This
is
your
home...
and
I
don't
want
to
But
if
you
can
let
us
do
our
work
here...
You
brought
others?

Just
a
few.
I'm
not
a
threat.
If
I
am...
then
I
guess
you
can
kill
me.


CARVER:
Come
on!
ELLIE:
Wait,
wait,
wait!
ALEXANDER:
Stop,
stop.

We
need
to
give
them
our
guns.
That's
the
one
condition.
What
does
that
mean?
We
can
stay.

If
they
get
power,
they'll
be
more
dangerous!
Why
help
them?!
They
seem
desperate...
If
we
make
them
go,
they'll
attack.
Let
them.
We'll
destroy
them
while
they're
weak.
And
how
many
apes
will
die?
We
have
one
chance
for
peace...
Let
them
do
their
human
work.
Then
they'll
go.
Human
work?
Human
work.
Human
work.
Human
work!
Koba
say...
Apes
should
hate
humans...
Enough!
From
humans
Koba
learned
hate...
But
nothing
else.
Hey.
You
need
to
eat.
Okay.
That
was
brave,
what
you
did
today.
Malcolm.
I
know
everyone's
depending
on
you...
I
don't
care
about
that.
I
care
about
him.
He
saw
things
that
no
kid
should
see,
and
I'm
not
letting
us
go
back
to
that.
I
know.
ELLIE:
I
have
been
trying
But...
You
will.
FOSTER:
You
know
They
don't
need
power,
lights.
Heat.
Nothing.
MALCOLM:
Hey,
pal.
That's
what
makes
them
stronger.
Malcolm,
I'm
thinking
With
what?
They
took
our
guns.
If
they
wanted
us
dead,
Maybe
they're
just
taking
their
time.
They
killed
off
half
the
planet
already.
-
Come
on.
You
can't
honestly
blame
the
apes.
Who
the

else
am
I
going
to
blame?

You're

Huh?
Didn't
you
have
a
little
girl?
MALCOLM:
Carver,
that's
enough.
CARVER:
-
How
did
she
die?
Or
your
wife,
for
that
matter.
FOSTER:
Carver,
you
better
shut
up...
before
I
kick
your
ass.

CARVER:
Okay.
I'm
the
asshole.
Are
you
okay?


You
sound
sick...
You
ok?
Just
need
rest.

You
worry
about
the
humans...



Where's
Koba?
Still
angry.
Said
he
was
going
hunting...


Look,
humans
below!

Why
are
we
here?
Caesar
trusts
humans...
Koba
does
not.
Most
of
the
arsenal
seems
functional.
Good.
We're
testing
them
out
back.



McVEIGH:
Hey!
Don't
you
move!
Don't
move,
do
you
understand
me?
Huh?
Terry!
Terry,
get
in
here,
quick!
Holy
shit.

What
do
we
do?
Huh?
What
do
we
do?
Where
did
he
come
from?
McVEIGH:
Should
we
shoot
him?
TERRY:
Maybe.
Yeah,
I
don't
know.

are

son

bitch,
aren't
you?


Whoa,

must
have

lost?
Trying
to
get

Go
on!
Get
out

stupid
monkey!
Go
on.
You
heard
him.
Go!
Enough
guns
here
to
kill
every
ape...
Must
warn
Caesar.
Who
knows
what
humans


MALCOLM:
We
gotta
clear
this
blockage.
I
didn't
know
you
had
a
daughter.
Yeah.
What
was
her
name?
Sarah.
I'm
really
sorry.
Well,
now
I
have
you
and
your
dad,
so...
Yeah.
MALCOLM:
All
right,
you
got
that
straight?

Whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
That's
all
the
wire
we
got.
Brace
yourselves.
Three,
two,
one.



ALEXANDER:
Dad!

Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Dad?
FOSTER:
I
can't
see
Carver.





Don't!
-
Leave
it
there.
ELLIE:
It's
not
broken.
Let
go.
Good.
Thank
you.
You
saved
our
lives.
We've
got
a
lot
of
debris
to
clear
now.
We
might
need
a
bit
more
time.
How
long?


Oh.


ALEXANDER:
Hey,
buddy.


ALEXANDER:
Hey...
hey...
CARVER:
What
are
you
doing?
What
are
you
looking
at?

Hey!
Hey!

Hey,
get
out
of
there!
-
Hey!
I'll
kill
you!


MALCOLM:
Don't!
Don't!
Caesar,
no!
No.
Said
no
guns!
-
No,
don't.

I
didn't
know.

Human
leave
now!







Man,
we
screwed
now.
Malcolm?
Malcolm,
where
are
you
going?
Malcolm.



MALCOLM:
Please,
please,

I'm
sorry.
That
was
all
my
fault.
This
my
home.
You
should
not
be
here.
I
understand.
Malcolm.

She's
sick.
How
long
has
she
been
this
way?
I
have
medicine.
Antibiotics.
Maybe
she
can
help.
Do
not
trust
you.
I
don't
blame
you.
But
believe
me...
we
are
not
all
like
him.
ELLIE:
Please.
Let
us
help
you.
One
day.
You
stay
one
day.
Father,
no...!
-
We
might
need
more
time.
Ape
will
help.
I
will
not
help!
CARVER:
This
is
bullshit,
man!
FOSTER:
Move!
That's
enough.
Come
on,
man.
Okay?
Move,
come
on!
Get
in!

See
you
tomorrow,
asshole.

Just
came
from
the
city.
Humans
very
dangerous!
Where
is
Caesar?
With
the
humans...
Yo,
Alex.
This
relay's
busted.
Yeah.

Caesar.

Hey!

No!
No,
no,
no,
don't!
No!
No!
No!

Where
Caesar?
Want
Caesar.
Caesar!

Humans
attack
your
sons.
You
let
them
stay!
Put
apes
in
danger!
Caesar
love
humans
more...
than
apes!
More
than
your...
sons.








Ape...
not...
kill...
ape.


Forgive
me.
You
are
my
son...
I
need
you
to
listen...
You
didn't
tell
Caesar
about
the
guns
we
found?
Neither
will
you.
Your
father
doesn't
trust
me
now.
You
need
to
protect
him.
His
love
for
humans...
Makes
him
blind.
I
know...
As
long
as
they
are
here...
I
fear
for
Caesar's
life.
For
yesterday.

My...

I

Try

speak.
You
need
to
rest.
Hold.
He's
lost
a
lot
of
blood.
Is
he
going
to
make
it?
I
don't
understand.
Where
did
Carver
get
the

Why
would
he
do
this?
CAESAR:
Ape...
What?
Ape...
did...
this.
Get
in

Followed
the
humans
here.
Hiding
everywhere!
We
must
catch

all!




Kill
him.
MAN:
No,

Go

ELLIE:
Malcolm,

ALEXANDER:
I

MALCOLM:
It

We
just

a

to
hide
him

MALCOLM:
Go

the
table.

ELLIE:
Okay.
Right
here.

Okay.
Dad,
look.
Look.
We
need
to
operate.
I
don't
have
anything.
There's
a
surgical
kit
I'll
go.
It's
not
safe.
He's
the
only
one
that
can
stop
this.

KOBA:
Humans!
You
ape
prisoner
now!
You
will
know
life
in
cage.
More
humans
out
there.
Go!
Find
them!


Maurice...?
Koba
said...
...we're
too
loyal
to
your
father.
Protect
yourself.







Shit!





MALCOLM:
Hey,
wait.
Your
father.
He's
alive.

MALCOLM:
I
got
it.
How
is
he?
Your...
mother.
Brother.
Safe?
For
now.


No.
No.
Not
human.
Koba.
ELLIE:
Malcolm.
Yeah.
Caesar.
We
need
to
do
this
now.
Son.

How
is
he?
We'll
see.
He's
very
strong.
It's
gonna
be
okay.

I'm
so
sorry...
For
everything.
No.
I...
am
to
blame.
But
Koba
betrayed
you.
I...
chose
to
trust
him...
because
he
is
ape.
I
always
think...
ape
better
than
human.
I
see
now...
how
much
like
them
we
are.
Where
Koba
now?
On
the
human
tower...
Loyal
apes
around
him.
And
those
who
not
follow?
Prisoners.
Maurice.
Rocket.

Koba
killed
Ash.
Fear
makes
others
follow.
But
when
they
see
you
alive...
They
will
turn
from
Koba.
Not
if
I
am
weak.
Ape
always
seek
strongest
branch.
I
must
do
something
to
stop
him.
Father.
Let
me
help
you.



MAN:
Please,
let
us
out
of
here!



















WILL:
Okay.
Caesar,
look.
Apple.
Apple.
Good.
Home.
Home.
Home.
Yes.

This
is
your
home.
Your
home.
Good.
Good.
That's
good.




MALCOLM:
Sorry.
I
didn't
mean
to
intrude.
It's
been
two
days.
Your
son
is
not
back
yet?

Who
was
that?
On
the
video.
A
good
man.
Like
you.


They
need
to
get
to
the
tower
I'm
gonna
take
him
through
the
subway.
I
love
you.
Koba
sent
for
the
females
and
young.
They're
on
their
way.
Mother
too.
Must
go.
Now!
Are
you
okay?

FINNEY:
Who's
there?
If
you're
human,
you
better
say
so!
It's
me!
It's
Malcolm!
Don't
shoot!
Take
the
stairs.
They'll
bring
you
around
Go.
Thank
you.
Trust.
All
right,
I'm
coming
out!
Don't
shoot!
FINNEY:
Hey!
Look
who
I
found.
I
didn't
know
if
you'd
made
it
out.
Good
to
see
you.
Don't
worry.
We're
gonna
turn
all
this
around.
What
do
you
mean?
What's
going
on?
The
apes.
They're
all
over
the
tower.
WERNER:
I
lost
the
signal.
It
dropped
out.
Keep
trying.
Malcolm,
look
at
this.
C-4.
Five-pound
blocks.
We
just
started
setting
them.
They're
gonna
take
down
the
whole
tower.
Blast
them
all
at
once.
We
could
use
your
help.

Can

I'm

but
I
can't
let
you
do
this.
We
need
to
give
him
a
chance.
We
need
to
give
him
some
time.
He's
up
there
right
now.
Who's
up
there?



Caesar
has
no
place
here.
Apes
follow...
Koba
now.
Follow
Koba...
to
war.
Apes
win
war!
Apes
together
strong!
Caesar...
weak.
Koba
weaker.







Are
you
out
of
your
fucking
mind?
No,
I've
seen
things.
They
want
what
we
want,
to
survive.
They
don't
want
a
war.
They're
animals!
They
attacked
us!
Because
they
thought
we
attacked
them.
They
think
that
he's
dead,
but
he's
not...
Sit
down,
Finney!
Sit
down!

Trusted
Koba
like
brother.
Caesar
brother
to
human!

Koba
fight
for
ape!
Free
ape!

Kill
ape.
Koba
fight
for
Koba.

Koba...
belong
in
cage.









I
know
how
this
must
sound.
I
don't
think
you
have
any...

Do
you
think
stopping
me
will
matter?
They're
coming.
Now,
we
made
contact
They're
already
on
their
way!
It's
true.
Dreyfus!
What
are
you
doing,
man?
I'm
saving
the
human
race.
No!



















Ape...
not
kill...
ape.

You
are...
not
ape.
No!





Leave
him!
You're
not
safe
here.
They
made
contact.
You
have
to
leave
now.
Everyone.
If
you
don't
go,
it'll
be
all-out
war.
War...
has
already...
begun.
Ape
started
war.
And
human...
Human
will
not
forgive.
You
must
go...
before
fighting
begins.
I
am
sorry...
my
friend.
I
thought
we
had
a
chance.
I
did,
too.
CORNELIA:
Mmm.
