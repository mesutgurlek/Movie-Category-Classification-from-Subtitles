WILL:
I
don't
have
time.
I
don't
have
time
to
It
is
what
it
is.
We're
enetically
engineered
The
trouble
is,
we
live
only
one
more
year
unless
we
can
get
more
time.
Time
is
now
the
currency.
We
earn
it
and
spend
it.
The
rich
can
live
forever.
And
the
rest
ofus?
I
just
want
to
wake
up
than
hours
in
the
day.
Hey,
Mom.
You
got
in
late
last
night.
I
put
in
some
overtime.
Where'd
it
go?
On
you.
They
drink
it
in
New
Greenwich.
Fifty?
That's
right.
Twenty-five
for
the
25th
time.
Oh,
I
was
sure
I'd
have
a
grandchild
by
now.
Here
we
go.
Bela's
daughter
is
always
asking
about
you.
Who
has
time
for
a
girlfriend?
What
do
you
got?
Three
days.
Not
even.
We
owe
half
that
in
rent.
Eight
for
the
electric
and
I
can
make
extra
on
the
side,
you
know.
-
I
could...
Nobody
wins.
Yeah.

Remember,
I'm
not
here
tonight.
I
got
two
days'
work
in
the
garment
district.
-
I
know.
-
After
I
pay
off
the
loan,
I
won't
have
long.
Will...
I
just
wouldn't
know
what
to
do
if
I
lost
you.
I'm
late.
Let
me
give
you
3o
minutes
I
love
you.
Happy
birthday,
Mom.
When
you
get
back,
GIRL:
Will!
Will!
You
got
a
minute?
What
are
you
talking
about,
Mya?
Not
a
year
I
can
use
yet.
Come
on,
Will.
I've
got
bills
to
pay.
Here,
take
five
minutes.
Get
out
of
here.
Four
minutes
for
a
cup
of
coffee?
Yesterday,
it
was
three.
You
want
coffee
or
you
want
to
reminisce?
Two
coffees.
-
How
many
shifts
you
got
today,
Borel?
Really
excited
about
it.
If
you
had
any
of
your
father
in
you,
I
don't
fight.
There's
another
one.
Broad
daylight.
Whoa,
what
is
this?
Where's
the
rest?
Never
met
the
quota.
My
units
are
up
from
last
week.
So's
the
quota.
Next.
That's
a
joke,
right?
-
Next.

You
in,
Will?
I
don't
have
time
to
gamble
anymore.
Oh,
thank
God.
Because
ever
since
you
stopped
playing,
You
still
owe
me
an
hour.
You
seen
Borel?
-
Will!
Your
wife's
looking
for
you.
You're
not
gonna
believe
it.
This
madman's
been
buying
drinks
all
night.
Come
on,
let
me
get
you
home.
Soon
as
I
finish
this
drink.
Hey!
You!
You!
More
everything!
Do
you
want
to
come
home
with
me?
You
can
take
us
both
home.
Excuse
me.
You
need
to
get
out
of
here.
Somebody's
gonna
clean
that
clock.
Yes!
I
mean,
they
aren't
going
to
rob
you.
They
can't
take
that
much
time
and
let
you
live
to
tell
about
it.
Yes.
I
don't
think
you
understand.

BOREL:
Will.
Will!
Minutemen!
Minutemen!
Walk
away,
Will.
Those
gangsters
aren't
playing
around.
Wait,
wait.
He's
asking
for
it.
Let's
go.
You
think
he'd
help
us?
Don't
worry.
I
won't
do
anything
stupid.
Go.
The
name's
Fortis.
And
that,
sir,
is
a
very
nice
watch.
Do
you
mind
if
I
try
it
on?
FORTIS:
I'll
tell
you
what.
I'll
fight
you
for
it.
Come
on.
I'm
an
old
man.
Turned
75
last
week.
I
need
a
moment.

You
ready
to
go?
Ready
to
go.
Let's
get
you
out
of
here.
Get
him!
Stop.
What
are
you
doing?
Yeah,
it
looked
like
it.
I
know
what
I'm
doing.
Run.
Run!


WILL:
Come
on!
Here!
Hurry!
Move!
Where
the
hell
are
you
going?
Get
in
here!

I
know
who
took
him.
I
know
who
he
is.
Who
he
was.


Damn
it,
damn
it.

What
the
hell
are
you
doing
here?
Flashing
all
that?
You
out
of
your
mind?
Henry
Hamilton.
Will
Salas.
Ugh.

God.
Drink
more,
it
gets
better.

Not
much
better.
You'll
be
safe
till
morning.
I'll
get
you
out
of
here.
You're
from
New
Greenwich.
Does
it
show?
Nah.
Looks
like
you
could
use
some
help
yourself.
No,
thanks.
How
old
are
you?
In
real
time?
Twenty-eight.
I'm
1o5.
Good
for
you.
You
won't
see
1o6,
you
have
too
many
You
are
right.
But
the
day
comes
when
you've
had
enough.
Your
mind
can
be
spent,
We
want
to
die.
We
need
to.
That's
your
problem?
You
ever
known
anyone
who's
died?
For
a
few
to
be
immortal,
many
must
die.
What
the
hell
is
that
supposed
to
mean?
You
really
don't
know,
do
you?
Everyone
can't
live
forever.
Why
do
you
think
there
are
Time
Zones?
Why
do
you
think
taxes
and
prices
go
up
the
same
day
in
the
ghetto?
The
cost
of
living
keeps
rising
to
How
else
could
there
be
while
most
live
day
to
day?
But
the
truth
is
there's
more
than
enough.
No
one
has
to
die
before
their
time.
If
you
had
as
much
time
what
would
you
do
with
it?
I'd
stop
watching
it.
I
can
tell
you
one
thing.
If
I
had
all
that
time,
I
sure
as
hell
wouldn't
waste
it.

Get
some
rest.
Don't
worry.
I
won't
take
it
in
the
night.
And
I
won't
take
yours.

It
does
get
better.




-
Oh,
hey,
Will.
Is
Borel
in?
Yeah.
Borel?
Look
at
that.
A
shame
we
gotta
wait
25
years.
We
could
use
that
year
right
now.
Borel?
I'm
here.
You'd
better
get
her
inside,
Greta.
Look
at
this.
Where
did
you
get
that?
The
guy
at
the
bar.
They
were
going
to
kill
him.
He
gave
it
to
me.
He
timed
himself
out
No
one
gives
anybody
1oo
years.
He
didn't
just
give
me
this.
He
gave
me
the
truth
about
it.
You
can't
let
anyone
see
that.
Hey.
You
know
that
time
will
get
you
killed.
How
long
have
we
been
friends?
What,
1o
years?
Here.
A
decade.
You've
been
like
a
brother.
Where
are
you
going?
Where
this
won't
look
out
of
place.
I
finally
got
the
time
to
take
my
mom

I'm
going
out!

Around

What

Interesting.
How

What

Trust

What

are
you?
You
do
everything
a

too
fast.
Not

What's
that

across

The

Can
anybody

Not

Good
luck.
Sir,
you
were
right.
If
you
turn
back
the

and
look
at

checks,
someone
spent
years
crossing
To
New
Greenwich.
The
cameras
picked
up
He's
conscious
of
the
surveillance,
he
doesn't
have
a
bodyguard,
and
he
runs.
But
if
he
has
time,
he
doesn't
need
to
run.
It's
a
hard
habit
to
break.
You're
looking
for
a
match?
His
name
is
Will
Salas.
You
know
him?
No.
I
remember
his
father.

Good
evening.
I
assume
my
time
is
as
good
as
anyone's.
Indeed
it
is.
However,
for
non-members.
Most
give
a
year.
What's
your
game?
Poker.
Right
this
way.
What's
the
limit?
There
is
none.
I
don't
believe
we've
had
the
pleasure
Salas.
Will
Salas.
Philippe
Weis.
You
must
come
from
time.
You
could
say
I'm
gambling
my
inheritance.
You
don't
have
a
guard,
Mr.
Salas?
I
assumed
I
was
amongst
friends.
Bet
you
5o
years.
You
must
be
young.
When
you've
been
25
for
85
years,
knowing
only
a
random
act
of
violence
you
learn
to
appreciate
what
you
have.
And
you
seem
to
have
a
lot
to
appreciate.
I
call.
Of
course,
The
time
difference
between
Zones.
I've
heard
that.
But
isn't
this
just
the
next
logical
step
And
hasn't
evolution
always
been
unfair?
It's
always
been
survival
of
the

Raise
you

This
is
merely

Natural

Absolutely.

It
appears
you're

Well
played.
That
was
some

It
wasn't
a

No

I

I
was
going
to
win.

Confusing

hoping

told.
Very
beautiful.

Will
Salas.
Congratulations,
Mr.
Salas.
You've
taken
years
off
my
father's
life.
Which
is
normally
what
you
do.
We're
having
a
party
tomorrow
night.
Perhaps
you'll
give
him
a
chance
to

love
to.
Carl

am.
Good
night,
Mr.

Delivery?
To

Display
it?
Hell,
I'm
going
to
drive

Will
Salas.
Allow
me
to
introduce
my
wife,
Michele,
and
my
daughter,
Sylvia.
I
believe
you
two
have
already
met.
Nice
to
meet
you
all.
PHILIPPE:
I'll
come
find
you
later
for
our
game.
I
look
forward
to
it.
Having
fun,
Mr.
Salas?
Please,
call
me
Will.
It's
okay,
Constantin.
Do
you
always
have
a
hired
hand
No.
I
usually
have
two.
That
doesn't
make
it
very
easy
I
think
that's
the
idea.
Your
idea?
My
father's.
I
understand.
You
all
have
a
lot
to
lose.
So
do
you.
What
do
you
do,
Will?
I
haven't
quite
figured
that
out
yet.
Yes,
why
bother?
What's
the
hurry?
Right.
Why
do
today
what
I
know
one
thing
we
can
do.
Dance
with
me.

Do
you
really
come
from
time?
Why
would
you
doubt
that?
I
saw
you
run.
Reminds
me
of
people
Sometimes
I
envy
them.
You
don't
know
anything.
Oh,
no?
The
clock
is
good
for
no
one.
The
poor
die
and
the
rich
don't
live.
We
can
all
live
forever
as
long
as
Doesn't
that
scare
you?
That
maybe
Or
courageous
or
anything
worth
a
damn?
Come
with
me.
JAEGER:
This
was
tonight.
He's
only
an
hour
ahead
of
us.
Look
at
that.
I've
never
seen
anything
like
it.
What
are
you
doing?
We
don't
go
in.
You're
insane.
You
have
this
in
your
backyard.
And
I'm
insane?
Well?
What
are
you
waiting
for?
Sylvia,
come
on!
What
happened
to
doing
something
foolish?

I
don't
know
you.
We
could
change
that.
I
get
it.
You're
out
here,
all
alone,
with
a
stranger.
You
can't
be
too
careful.
Maybe
you
can.
Sylvia!
Sylvia!
I
have
to
go
back.
To
what?
You
should
go
back.
-
Have
you
seen
my
daughter?
She's
with
her
guards.
Right
behind
you.
Thank
God.
Now,
how
about
that
game?


It's
all
right,
everyone.
What's
this
about?
I'm
sorry
to
have
to
I
just
need
a
word
with
your
friend.
My
friend?
Very
well.

I'm
Timekeeper
Raymond
Leon.
I'm
Will
Salas.
I
know.
What
are
you
doing
in
this
Zone?
It's
not
illegal,
is
it?
To
change
Time
Zones?
No,
it's
not
illegal.
It's
just
rare.
Where
did
you
get
that?
I
won
it.
Gambling.
All
of
it?
No.
A
man
named
Henry
Hamilton
He
said
he
didn't
need
it
anymore.
He
timed
himself
out.
Henry
Hamilton
was
He
could
practically
live
forever.
You
expect
me
to
believe
that
I
don't
expect
you
to
believe
it.
But
it's
the
truth.
It
was
a
gift.
I'm
not
a
thief.
But,
hey,
if
you
guys
maybe
you
should
arrest
everyone
here.
Oh,
I
see.
You're
talking
about
justice.
Well,
I
am
a
Timekeeper.
I
don't
concern
myself
with
"justice.
"'
I
only
concern
myself
Seconds,
minutes,
hours.
I
keep
time.
And
that
time
is
in
the
wrong
hands.
That
time
will
be
held,
along
with
you.
We'll
leave
you
two
hours
Why
are
you
investigating
a
suicide?
There's
mass
murder
That
is
fascinating.
Huh.
I
heard
another
man
talk
like
that.
It
was
over
2o
years
ago.
You're
probably
too
young
We'll
arrange
safe
transport.
This
is
New
Greenwich,
after
all.
Sylvia?
Do
as
I
say
and
go
with
the
guards.
Oh,
for
God's
sake,
Father.
If
we
can't
stop
one
man
from
killing
us,


Stop
him!
Move!
Get
out
of
the
way!
-

Put
it
down
or
I'll
blow
her
head
off.
Thanks.

You're
going
to
kill
us!

What
are
you
doing?
Do
you
even
know
how
to
drive?
What's
there
to
know?

-
Oh,
shit.



Give
me
some
time.
I
guess
you
really
are
What
the
hell
do
you
know
about
Or
you're
gonna
kill
me,
Lend
me
an
hour.
I'm
not
giving
you
a
second.
I
should
have
listened
to
my
father.
Please,
take
me
home.
Please.
-
I
can't
do
that.
You're
keeping
me
alive.
Keep
that
covered.
Anybody
sees
it,
you're
definitely
dead.

Now
that
worked
too
well.
You
guys
wasted
a
gorgeous
car.
Look
who
it
