When
I
was

I'd
wake
up
and
My
father
would
get
angry.

I
no

gaijin.
I
never

Who
hired
you?
Uh-oh.
Take
me
to
Noburo.
Logan...
I
need
to
tell
you
something.
Do
it.
Now.
You
wait
in
the
car.
Logan.
I
saw
you
die.
What?
I
saw
you
die.
When?
Just
now?
Awhile
ago.
But
it's
not
like
More
like
looking
But
I'm
always
right.
All
I
can
see
is
one
part
their
death.
And
I
saw
yours.
So,
what
did
you
see?
I
see
you
on
your
back.
You're
holding
your
own
It's
not
beating.
I
don't
have
time
When
I
was
five,
I
knew
how
Then
I
watched
it
happen
Look
at
me.
A
lot
of
people
have
tried
to
Yeah...
but
you're
different
They
can
hurt
you.
They
can
kill
you.
Just
wait
in
the
car.
I
said,
wait
in
the
car.
You're
not
safe,
Just
think
of
me



WOMAN:
Sexy.
NOBURO:

WOMAN:
Okay,

And

It's
true.
Mariko
would
have
never
gone
not
once
the
will
was
revealed.
She
never
took
to
me.
Oh,
really?
Shingen
promised
me
So,
you
put
a
hit
on
his
daughter.
Political
careers
That's
right.
Wait!
Wait!
No!
You
wanted
the
truth.
I
didn't
like
it.
Wow.
How

there's
I
didn't.

You've
gone
insane.
I'm
just

up.
If
you
kill
me,
what
little
Fear
not
Mariko.
I
don't
want
to
hurt
you.
I
want
to
help
you.
Help
you
end
your
pain...
what
that
mutant
stopped
you...
from
doing
last
week.
I
never
wanted
to
die,
Father.



It's
alright,
Mariko.

Come
with
me.
What
is
happening?!
More
than
you
can
imagine.
You.
Me.
Sorry
to
interrupt,
but
I
What
are
you?
A
chemist,
a
nihilist...
a
capitalist,
a
mutation.
A
viper.



Where
is
the
security?
Yakuza.
Shingen?

Logan.
This.
This
here.
Where
is
this?
Master
Yashida's
birthplace.
The

built
a
facility
How
far?
500
kilometers
from
here.




I
gotta
get
that
How?
No,
stop,
Logan.
I
saw
you
die.
I'm
never
wrong.
You
didn't
know
the
old
I
saw
you
die
in
a
room

this
I
can't

her
with
I'm
the
only
chance
she's
got,
but
You're
going
to
die,
Logan.
Maybe
that's
okay.
No,
listen
to
me,
Logan!
No,
stop.
Logan!
You're
not
gonna
want
to
watch
this
part.
No!
Listen
to
me!
No,
stop.
Logan!

Move!
Stay
away
from
him.

He
killed
your
master.
Put
hands
on
your
sister.
And
now
you
want
him?

Oh,
no.
I
can't
see.
You'll
always
be
a
beggar.
You're
crazy.
LOGAN:
Oh,
no.





Yukio.



Logan!

Logan!
Logan!
Logan!
Don't
hit
my
friends.
Where's
Mariko?
She's
gone.
That
Viper
It
was
my
father's
obsession...
with
mutation,
like
you
and
her,

You
tried
to
kill
Live
with
that.

What
kind
of
monster
are
you?
The
Wolverine.
Hey,
come
here,
I
was
wrong.
I
told
you.
Let
me
have
a
look
at
you.
It's
nothing.
Hey,
thank
you.
It's
a
trap,
Logan.

Why
have
you
brought
me
here?
What
are
you
hiding?
You
will
soon
find
out.
Welcome,
Mariko.
It's
all
right,
Mariko.
She
also
MARIKO:
She
serves
herself.
She
infected
Logan.
Hmm...
And
what
about
Grandfather?
What
did
you
infect
him
with?
I
granted
his
dying
wish.
I
helped
him
rest.
Now,
it's
your
turn.


Listen
to
me,
mutant.
She
will
be
fine.
So
long
as
you
do
your
job.
Logan
will
be
here
soon,
It
was
easy
to
lure
him
here.
It's
another
thing
We're
ready.
He's
never
Yes,
well...
Dip
your
arrows
in
this.
It
won't
kill
him,
but
it
will
slow
him
down.
Keep
your
potions.
He's
no
challenge
Okay.
But
when
you
fail...
you
have
this.
VIPER:
Did
you
have
I
don't
know
to
deceive
Harada
Now,
now,
calm
down.
Your
grandfather
sought
me
out.
I
am
the
head
And
why
do
you
suppose
that
is?
Why
do
you
think
Because
you
are
strong?
Or
because
you
are
weak?
I
see
you've
come
to
fight.
It's
pointless.
You're
weak.

Black
Clan

that
all
the
men

her.
We
are

for
your
But
there
is
one
more
sacrifice
Go
fuck
yourself,
pretty
boy.








Yukio,
run!





Logan.


KAYLA:
Logan.
LOGAN:
Kayla.
I
love
you.
Logan.
MARIKO:
Logan!
Jean.
JEAN
GREY:
Save
me.




Stand
back.
Where
is
she?
Where
is
she?
"Where
is
Mariko?"
Still
pining
away?
That's
so
sweet.
Impressive,
no?
He
is
made
of
adamantium,

Oh,
Logan,
you
know
what,
I
get
it.
I
know
she's
here.
You
want
answers.
Yes,
I
want
answers!
I'm
sorry,
but
I
was
hired
in
I'm
sure
you
were.
That“
and
a
certain
talent
for
combining
High-grade
toxins
It
helps
to
be
to
every
poison
And
immune
to
the
toxin
as
I
am.
I'll
tell
you
what,
why
don't
you
and
we'll
see

The
claws.


I
know
you
care
for
him.
You
need
to
let
go
of
that.
You
are
a
Yashida.
She
betrayed
my
grandfather...
and
so
have
you.
No
Mariko.
We
grew
up
together.
You
need
to
trust
me.
Let
me
go
to
him!
He
saved
my
life!
Let
him
go,
Mariko!
This
isn't
easy
for
me
but...
I'm
following
The
suppressant
bug
you
found
You
took
it
out
on
your
own.
I
didn't
see
that
coming.
The
Viper
woman
is
evil...
we
both
know
that.
But
she's
a
means
to
an
end...
LOGAN:

An
end
your
grandfather
wanted.
VIPER:
You
are
strong.
You
have
courage.
Real
courage.

But
that
won't
help
much
now.
What
the...?
You
need
to
trust
me.
Is
that
hard?
We
were
meant
to
be
together.
We
still
can
be.
Perhaps.


MARIKO:
Stop!

This
is
madness.
Let's
go.
Go!
Run!


Come
on.
Mariko,
come!


Mariko,
get
out!







Ahhh!






Come
on.
This
is
not
the
way.

Two
hands.
Master...
Hey!
Bub!



MARIKO:
Harada.

I'm
sorry.






Now,
you
die.
Today
is
not
my
day.





Hey!
Logan-san.
Don't
look
so
shocked.
With
you
at
my
side,
Surely,
I
could
survive
this.
It's
all
right.
Dr.
Green
and
I
have
been
waiting.
It's
only
this
armor
We
built
it
to
make
me
strong,
so
I
And
transfer
your
to
my
body.
My
legacy
must
be
preserved.
Your
mistake
was
to
believe
can
have
no
meaning.
It
is
the
only
life
that
can.
Hold
on.
We
are
almost
there.
The
peace,
Your
reward.
You
know,
I'm
giving
you
longed
for.


This
feeling...
to
be
invincible...
like
you.


You
are
a
monster.
Mariko.
It's
me.
I
buried
my
grandfather.






You
asked
me
to
Sayonara.



Are
you
all
right?
Logan.
JEAN
GREY:

Logan.
Logan.
You're
here.
Of
course.
Can
you
stay?
I
can't.
Yes,
you
can.
This
is
what
you
wanted.
Not
anymore.
I'm
all
alone
here.
You
put
me
here.
You
were
hurting
people,
Jean.
I
had
to.
I
love
you,
Jean.
I
always
will.

You
are
my
only
family.
Be
well,
sister.
Am
I
wrong
to
think
Stay.
I
can't,
princess.
I'm
a
soldier,
and
I've
been
hiding
too
long.
