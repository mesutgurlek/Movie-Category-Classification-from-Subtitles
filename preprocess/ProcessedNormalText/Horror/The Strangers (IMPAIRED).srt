-Hi
-Is

See
you

weird
She
seems

said
if
she
wasn't.

It's
cold
outside

"Kill...."
-I'm
out
of
cigarettes
-No,
I
didn't
mean

to,
just
go
to
sleep,
I'm
tired
anyway
-I'll
drive
Let
me
light
you
a
fire
-I
was
thinking
when
you
were
taking
a
bath,
I
want
you
to
take
the
car
back
tomorrow
I
don't
think
a
roadtrip
is
such
a
good
idea
right
now.

I
called
Mike,
he's
gonna
come
out
get
me
in
the
morning.
Are
you
sure
that's
what
you
want?
Yeah....
Okay,
I'll
be
back,
...if
you
want,
we
could
talk
some
more,
you
don't
have
to,
OK?
-You
gonna
be
OK
here?

Yeah,
I'll
be
fine


"Should
we
go
outside,
should
we
play
somewhere?"

Hello

-You
already
came
by
here




Oh,

keeps
knocking
on
the
door.
What
do
you

heard
her
voice
No,
I
didn't
open
the
door.
I
don't
know,
the
battery's
dead,
I'm
charging
it
right
now.
Ok,

I
just
want
you
to
come
home

No,
I'm
fine,

Kristen,

She's
watching
us
-She
looks
like
a
ghost,
-Want
me
to
go
talk
to
her?

-They
don't
want
to
talk

-Well,
They
want
something
-Shit..

-what?
-I
left
my
phone
in
the
car,
-Why?
Kristen,
nobody

She's

Fuck...
Shit...

What

-I

you
to
get
your
things,
put
your
shoes
on.
Did

find
your
phone?

-No!
I
plugged
it
into
the
wall,
and
when
I
came
back,
it
was
gone
I
just,
I
don't
understand,
I
checked
the
whole
house,
there's
nobody
in
here.
Let
me
see
your
hand..
What
are
you
thinking..?
It's
since
we've
been
here,
I
haven't
heard
a
dog
park,
not
a
car
pass.

Nothing.
Just
us
and
"them"
-Why
are
they
doing
this?
Don't
think
about
it..
It
doesn't
matter
right
now.
The
only
reason
is
if
they'd
come
through
that
door..Ok?
-What
is
it?
-Shit!

-Who
is

Get
out
of
the
car..!
Oh!
Shit!
Come

-James,

a
gun
-Does

a
gun?

Let's

Got

don't
know
how
to
use
this
thing..

-What
-But

said

used
to
hunt
with
your
dad..
-No,
I
never
did,
it's
just
something
that
I
said.
I'm
gonna
open
the
door,

I
just
want
