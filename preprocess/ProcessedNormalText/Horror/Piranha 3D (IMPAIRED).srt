It
was
a
mistake.
Can't
we
just
work
something
out
here?
Mistake
or
no
mistake,
you
just
destroyed
private
property.
And
from
the
smell
of
your
breath,
Maybe
get
a
ride
home
with
your
friends.
I
don't
know,
I
thought
you'd
take
you
home.
Touching
an
officers
uniform
is
considered
an
assault?
Were
you
aware
of
that?
You
look
pretty
hot
in
tan.
It's
not
tan,
it's
beige!
Hey,
take
it
easy!
Another
step
and
you'll

lightning
bolts

next
week,

average

No,

Let's

boobs.
Shut

sunscreen.
Sunscreen?

We

We

No,
I'm

homework,
and
stuff
for
school.
Laura
has
been
telling
me
that
you
may
I
don't
know
what
she's
talking
about.
I'm
100%
baby-sitting.
What?
No,
we
don't
want
babysitter.
Yeah
mum.
Especially
not
Jake.
I'm
serious,
mum,
we
dont
need
one.
Out,
out,
out.
Jake,
you
know
I
don't
have
a
backup.
I
know
mum.
Don't
worry,
you
know
how
crazy
this
week
is
for
you.
And
dont
worry,
I'll
take
care
of
the
nitwits,
ok?
Remember,
if
you
do
not
fulfill
their
responsibilities,
I
have
power
to
arrest
and
imprison
you.
Mum,
I'm
not
12.
playing
on
the
sheriff
card
doesn't
work.
No?
As
I
said,
I'll
take
care
of
them,
ok?
OK.
Now
get
outta
here
OK?
Oh
and
Jake.
It's
time
for
dinner.
OK,
alright,
I'll
be
right
there.
Hope
I
didn't
wake
the
kids?
They'll
sleep
through
anything.
So,
Maggy
said
yesterday
was
the
last
time
she
saw
him?
Yeah,
just
before
midnight.
She
said
Matt
took
a
boat
to
catch
some
bass.
She
drove
around
the
lake
all
night
looking
for
him.
Where's
the
boat?.
Feeling
like
a
skinny
dip?
Yeah,
if
we
can
make
it
to
the
end
of
the
pier
You
mean
I'm
to
old,
or
too
heavy?
I
think
you're
too
chicken-shit!
By
the
way,
Gordon
called
last
night.
Yeah?
He
said
that
U.S.G.S.
recorded
heavy
seismic
activity
below
the
lake.
Really?
Yeah,
they're
sending
in
a
team
of
seismologist
divers
And
he
told
them
that
you're
gonna
escort
them
out!
Jesus
Christ.
We've
just
been
invaded
by
20,000
kids
makes
us
a
little
busy
at
the
moment.
I
know.
That's
what
I
told
him

This
doesnt
sound
too
good
So,
what
time
are
the
divers
gonna
get
here?
He
said
around
10.
Shit.
Come
on,
just
a
little
more.
I
can't
get
it
-
Jules!
Give
me
your
hand!
Do
you
think
a
propeller
could've
done
this?
I
doubt
it.
Look
at
the
bones.
Nothing
broken
It
looks
like
toxic,
are
acidic
decomposition
it's
as
it
this
body
has
been
in
the
water
for
weeks
What
would
you
say
if
I
told
that
I'm
...at
least
until
we
get
an
autopsy
report
It'd
be
easier
to
drain
this
lake,
than
close
it.
I's
a
big
financial
week
for
this
town.
I'm
gettin
too
old
for
this
We're
not
liying
to
mum.
Come
on
guys,
every
year
it's
the
same.
and
miss
all
the
spring
break
fun.
You
mean
spring
break
boobies!
What
if
I
give
you
guys
the
cash
for
the
baby-sitting?
Sixty
bucks
and
you
gotta
deal.
Sixty?
But
I'm
only
getting
paid
forty.
Twenty
dollar
deception
surcharge!
Don't
pick
up
the
phone,
don't
answer
the
door
and
don't
leave
the
house.
OK?
I'm
counting
on
you
guys.
Alright?
Town
rules
son.
You
throw
a
peice
of
trash
in
the
lake,
After
the
dive,
our
presence
is
requested
at
'Cocomos'
Hi,
I'm
Sheriff
Forester.
Bob
Gordon
asked
me
to
take
you
out
to
the
site.
It's
nice
to
have
a
welcoming
committee
around
here
I
assume
that's
technical
equipment
too?
Yeah,
Sam,
give
them
back.
According
to
the
epicenter
coordinates
we
need
to
go
here.
Ok,
that's
about
20
minutes
out
Ready
when
you
are.
You
dont
see
many
women
working
Law
Enforcement
You
dont
see
a
lot
of
cowboys
though
Kelly.
Jake.
Who
exactly
are
you
baby-sitting
here?
This
is
a
funny
story
actually.
Wow.
Look
at
those
idiots.
Yeah,
it's
terrible.
Sandrat!
Hey
Sandrat,
I'm
talking
to
you.
Where
the
hell
have
you
been?
We've
got
the
girls
lubed
up
We're
ready
to
roll.
I'm
docking
your
paycheck!
Let's
go.
Now
I
see
what
you've
been
scouting
last
15
minutes.
Kelly,
it
was
great
to
see
you,
I
know
you
gotta
get
going...
Hi
Kelly,
I'm
Derick
Jones.
Hi
You
know
this
guy?
Jake?
Jake
is
my
boy!
He's
the
man
with
the
plan!
The
insight,
the
knowledge!
Great.
Those
girls,
they
aren't
with
you
are
they?
Yes,
why?
Are
you
into
girls?
No,
I'm
just
showing
him
around
town.
All
the
hotspots,
stuff
like
that.
The
job
is
called
location
scout,
and
Kelly
you
should
come
with
us.
Today
we're
gonna
be
making
movie
history.
No,
she's
got
other
plans
already.
Kelly
do
you
like
champagne?
I
love
champagne,

I
would
love
to
come
on
your
boat
Derek,
thanks.
Come

let

let
me
help
you
aboard.
Hey
Kelly
baby.
What
happened
to
hanging
with
us
today?
Who's
that
guy?
Is
he
your
boyfriend
or
something?
...who
said
he
has
back-stage
passes,
when
actually,
he
doesn't!
Come

Kelly!
T-shirts

fuck.
That

Derick
Jones!
Is
that
Jake
Forester?
See
you

4
in
wet
t-shirt
contest.
Dave,
we
have
to
talk
about
this
We
told
Jake
that
we'd
stay
at
the
house.
I
told
him
that
I
would
fish.
I
can't
if
there
are
no
fish.
The
lake's
too
busy.
Come
on.
Sand
Island
is
really
close
I
should've
brought
my
trombone.
No
way!
"Be
a
girl
and
sunbathe
or
something!
When
I
become
a
rock
star,
just
see
if
I
let
YOU
be
in
my
group!
Give
me
a
break!
You
play
the
trombone!
Here
we
go
ladies...
a
little
Champagne...
Cheers!
to
our
newest
'Wild
Wild
Girl'
That's
why
we
came
here.
Derick
wants
to
capture
innocence.
It's
all
about
innocence
Just
like
her.
Don't
worry.
Derick's
just
making
his
play.
It's
the
rules.
Show
a
girl
a
camera
and
she
WILL
perform.
It's
like
a
law
of
physics.
I've
seen
that
guy
charm
the
pants
off
a
lot
of
ladies.
She's
not
messing
up
your
party
is
she?
What
do
I
care.
She's
not
my
girlfriend.
This
is
great.
I'm
having
a
great
time.
We're
going
wild,
I'm
going
wild.
Hey,
Jake.
How
far
is
this
place?
Come
on!
Yeah,
yeah,
we're
almost
there
Speaking
of
going
wild...
you
haven't
seen
anything
yet!
Why
not
join
us?
Hey,
what's
up
guys?
Come
on
Sandrat.
Get
with
the
program.
Here
they
come,
here
they
come.
Here
come
my
nymphs.
Oh
my
God!
Check
it
out!
The
fish,
with
boobies
If
all
fish
look
like
that,
I
would
fuck
fish!
Looking
good
ladies.
You
like
this,
right
Jake?
You
should
be
paying
us
today,
not
the
other
way
around!
Look
at
these
goddess
aquatic
bitches.
This
is
hot
Andy!
This
is
so
hot.
This
is
what
it's
all
about
Beer,
sun
and
naked
hunnies
making
out
under
water!
Mum,
what's
going
on
there?
How
come
you
didn't
pick
up
the
home
phone?
I've
been
trying
to
reach
you.
I
was
outside.
I
can
go
and
get
it
if
you
need
me
to.
No,
that's
okay.
Oh
my
God!
What?
Nothing,
just
kids.
They're
outside
fishing...
...
and
it's
really
nice
to
see
them
...
...
playing
with
each
other.
Put
your
ass
on
the
glass!
Jake
is
someone
there
with
you?
No,
no,
no.
Just
the
kids
on
the
lake.
It's
crazy
here.
You
know
how
it
is.
Honey,
I
don't
want
Zane
or
Laura
near
the
lake
today,
you
hear
me?
OK,
we
will
stay
home
and
we'll
watch
TV.
OK,
I
gotta
go.
Thank
you
so
much
for
this
I'll
try
to
come
home
early,
ok?
Ok,
ok.
I
love
you.
I
gotta
go.
Kelly?
Kelly,
where
are
you?
Kelly?
Jake,
you
missed
the
rest
of
the
show.
Let's
go.
Towels
for
the
girls.
Wow!
Great!
good
work.
Way
to
tie
up
a
canoe
I
must've
gotten
my
knots
mixed
up.
So
you
catch
zero
fish,
and
lose
us
our
only
boat.
Jake's
gonna
kill
us.
Somebody
will
see
us.
See,
there
are
some
boats
over
there.
Don't
waste
your
time.
They'll
never
see
us,
it's
way
too
far.
Hello!
Hello!
We
need
help!
We're
over
here!
Help
us,
somebody.
We're
over
here,
help!
Woah!
Look
at
the
size
of
that!
What
is
it?
A
cavern
system?
Looks
to
me
like
a
subterranean
lake.
You
see
this
gap
here?
The
quake
opened
that
up,
now
it's
a
connecting
passage.
A
lake
under
a
lake?
That's
right.
I'm
afraid
it's
still
your
jurisdiction.
This
is
part
of
an
old
volcanic
ridge
all
over
this
area.
That's
the
beauty
of
it.
We're
gonna
be
the
first
ones
to
explore
it.
I
don't
know
why
you
get
s
o
excited
by
that
crap.
All
we
ever
see
is
rocks
and
sand.
I
should
warn
them,
it's
not
very
pretty
down
there.
Tourists
treat
this
lake
like
it's
a
garbage
can.
How's
it
going
down
there?
Sheriff
said
that
it's
a
real
treasure
trove
down
there
so
I've
got
dibs
on
the
old
body
spray,
and
'Jugs'
magazines
-
I
got
dibs
on
home
appliances.
Oh
my
God!
This
is
the
longest
one
I've
ever
seen.
Focus
on
the
task.
At
least
200
feet
Novak
Almost
full
visibility.
You
should
see
this.
It's
amazing!
Novak,
do
you
hear
me?
You're
about
90
feet
to
the
entrance
of
the
connecting
cave
It
looks
like
single
file
time
I'll
go
first
No,
I
should
de
the
preliminary
scout.
Anyway,
you'll
get
us
stuck!
Baby,
I'm
like
an
eel.
Electrical
eel
can
get
into
small
spaces
that
it
is
shocking.
That's
weird
Here
they
are
and
they're
splitting
up
Is
everything
alright?
I'm
losing
you
a
little
bit
here.
I'm
getting
a
serious
drop
in
temperature
it's
at
least
30
degrees
colder.
You're
probably
at
the
mouth
of
the
underwater
lake
Do
you
see
anything?
I'm
entering
the
cave
Jesus!
It
seems
endless.
You
gotta
see
this.
This
is
incredible
What
do
you
see
down
there?
Something
just
bit
me!
Yes,
okay,
I
thought
you
like
that
kinda
stuff?
Sam!
Sam!
Answer
me!
Something's
happening.
Oh
my
God!
Your
body
is
a
temple,
and
now
it
is
time
to
thank
the
Gods.
Andrew,
camera.
Come
on
you.
No,
thanks.
I
think
I've
already
had
too
much.
Come
on,
don't
you
want
to
worship
at
a
beautiful
altar.
I
know
you
prefer
champagne,
but
you
believe
us,
Come
on
Derick,
she
said
no.
No,
she
said
'no
thanks',
there's
a
difference.
Kelly,
come
on,
trust
us.
It's
never
cheating
Come
on.
Come
on,
it's
fun
Have
fun,
do
it!
Everybody's
doing
it
You're
not
trying
to
take
away
her
fun
are
you?
She's
er...
she's
not
my
girlfriend.
Fine!
I'll
do
it.
First
you
lick
the
salt
Here
we
go,
come
over
here
Then
you
suck
up
the
tequila.
You
don't
have
to
do
it.
OK.
And
to
try
with
Jake
and
Kelly?
What?
I
think
not.
Come
on
guys,
are
we
shooting
porn
today
or
not?
Thanks
Crystal.
Come
Kelly.
Yes,
and
salt.
A
little
tequila.
Let's
go.
Mr.
Goodman?
Coming.
I'm
coming,
hold
your
horses
The
store
is
closed
I
want
to
know
what
the
hell
this
thing
is
doing
in
my
lake?
Where
did
you
catch
this?
In
the
middle
of
the
lake.
Where
there
are
2
people
dead!
-
Oh
my!God!
Excuse
me,
but
is
that
a
fucking
Piranha?
And
it's
not
the
only
one.
Thousands!
And
they're
pissed!
I
heard
about
these
things
happening.
It's
like
those
baby
alligators
in
New
Jersey,
someone
leaves
them
...
...
and
then
they
bread.
Who
released
these
fish
into
the
lake?
What
are
you
talking
about?
This
particular
of
piranha
vanished
from
the
face
of
the
earth
more
than
two
million
years
ago!
Where's
he
going?
Allow
me...
to
introduce...
The
Pygocentrus.
The
original
piranha
They
used
to
swim
the
Colorado
River
Right
up
until
the
Ice
Age.
I
don't
understand
how
you
found
one...
alive?
We
discovered
a
subterannean
lake,
How
could
it
have
survived
so
long,
cut
off
from
the
surface?
Cannibalism.
They
must
have
fought
each
other
to
survive.
See.
Scars.
See
the
eyes.
Jesus.
It's
like
they're
staring
abck
at
you
No,
no,
no.
Not
staring.
Sensing.
God!
Dont
do
that.
Piranhas
hunt
in
packs.
Not
for
protection,
but
for
overwhelming
force.
They're
organised,
methodical
The
first
bite
draws
the
blood,
the
blood
draws
the
pack
How
do
I
stop
them?
Sorry,
you're
not
actually
thinking
about
They
are
killing
machines
but
they
are
still
fish.
But
if
there
really
are
thousands
...
Yesterday
would
have
been
a
good
time
to
start.
Shit.
My
little
brother
and
sister.
Are
they
waving
for
help?
I
don't
know.
They
should
be
home.
I
should
be
home.
Jake,

are
you
doing?
You're
gonna
miss
my
money
shot

Oh

Whatever

enter
the
water!
You
don't
understand,
Mum.
Our
boat
is
sinking.
Where
are
you?
What
are
you
doing?
I'm
coming
with
you.
Let's
go.
That's
mum.
Mum!
Hey!
How
are
we
gonna
get
the
boat

The
rope.
Do
you
think
it
will
reach?
Jake,
I'm
gonna
throw
you

rope.
Okay,
Mum.
Tied?
Back
up
a

Watch

I'll

her.
I'm
not
leaving
without

mum!
Jesus,

The
only
way
to
get
to
her
is
for
you
to
get
into
the
water
I'm
not
gonna
let
you
do
that!
The
reason
she
got
on
this
boat
was
coz
of
me
This
is
my
fault.
I'm
not
going
without
her.

Yes,

Julie.
Julie,
we
have
a
major
problem.
I'm
looking
out
at
a
school
of
dead
piranha.
You
don't
understand.
The
specimen
you
left
with
me
has
no
mature
reproductive
organs.
-
What?
The
piranhas
that
killed
those
divers,
the
ones
you're
hunting
for...
They're
not
fully
developed!
They're
the
babies!
Babies?
Well,
where
are
the
parents?
