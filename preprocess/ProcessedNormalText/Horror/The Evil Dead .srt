Hey
Ash,
where
are
we?
Well,
we
just
crossed
the
Tennessee
Border.
Which
would
put
us...
Yeeeah?
Which
would
put
us...
Right...
Here.
What
the
hell
was
that?

Are
you
trying
to
kill
us?
Hey!

Don't
blame
me!

It's
your
steering
wheel!

Damn
thing
jerked
right
out
of
my
hands.
I
don't
understand
it.

I
had
this
thing
in
for
a
tune-up
yesterday
and
they
said
they'd
go
over
everything.
Yeah!

Well
you
better
take
it
back
because
the
damn
thing
don't
work.

The
one
thing
that
does
work
is
this
lousy
horn.
Ah!

Go
to
hell!

I'm
not
honking
at
you!
Jesus
Christ.
Hey
Scotty!

What's
this
place
like
anyway?
Well,
the
guy
that's
renting
it
says
it's
an
old
place.

Little
run
down,
but
it's
right
up
in
the
mountains.

Yeah,
and
the
best
part
is
that
we
get
it
so
cheap.
Yeah,
why
are
we
getting
it
so
cheap?
Well,
I
don't
know.

Might
be
in
real
bad
shape.
You
mean,
nobody's
seen
this
place
yet?
Well,
not
yet.
Well,
it
might
not
be
that
bad.
No.
Actually,
it
might
be
kind
of
nice.
Yeah.
It's
probably
a
real
pit.
Ya,
I
think
this
is
where
we
get
off.
This
is
the
bridge
we're
going
to
cross?
Jesus
Christ!

The
whole
thing's
falling
apart
on
us!
Don't
let
the
noise
fool
you
girls,
this
thing
is
solid
as
a
rock.
It's
supposed
to
be
one
of
these
on
here.
Will
you
stop
it?
I
would
very
much
like
to
make
a
toast
for
all
this
evening.
"Ah,
as
a
great
friend
of
mine
once
said,
he
said,
""I...""
Oh
Ok
Ok"
"""??This
miss
tu
tarine??""."
Which
means?
Party
down!

Ya!
What
is
this?
Whatever
it
is,
it's
still
down
there.
I
don't
like
cellars.

Let's
just
close
it
up.

It's
probably
just
some
animal.
An
animal?

An
animal?



That
is
the
stupidest
thing
I
ever
heard
of.

Jesus
Christ.
There's
something
down
there.
Maybe
it
is
just
some
animal.
Yeah,
you're
probably
right.

Probably
just
some
animal.

Here
Cheryl,
why
don't
you
go
down
'n
check,
make
sure?
Scotty!

I'm
not
going
down
there!
Ok,
Ok
you
cowards,
I'll
go.
Be
careful.
Back
in
a
minute.
Hey
Scotty!

You
find
anything?

Scotty.

Scotty!

Scott!
He's
just
kidding
around...

Isn't
he?
Scotty!!

Scott!

Linda,
get
me
a
flashlight.
That's
the
only
one
we
brought
up.
Then
get
the
lantern.
Boo!!

Hahahahahah

Hey,
come
here,
I
wanna
show
you
something.

Look
at
all
this
stuff.

I
bet
this
still
shoots.
Probably
does.
Oh
God.

Look
at
this.
Look
at
this.



This
kind
of
looks
like
your
old
girlfriend.



C'mon,
let's
take
this
stuff
upstairs.
I'll
grab
the
recorder
and
you
get
everything
else
now...
Ok,
shhhh...

Listen
to
this.

This
is
the
tape
I
found
downstairs.


It
has
been
a
number
of
years
since
I
began
excavating
the
ruins
of
Candar
with
a
group
of
my
colleges.

Now
my
wife
and
I
have
retreated
to
a
small
cabin
in
the
solitude
of
these
mountains.
Here
I
continued
my
research
undisturbed
by
the
myriad
distractions
of
modern
civilization
and
far
from
the
groves
of
academe.

I
believe
I
have
made
a
significant
find
in
the
Candarian
Ruins.

A
volume
of
Ancient
Sumarian
burial
practices
and
funerary
incantations.

It
is
"entitled
""Morturom
Demonto""-
roughly
translated,
""Book
of
the
Dead""."
The
book
is
bound
in
human
flesh
and
inked
in
human
blood.

It
deals
with
demons
and
demon
resurrection
and
those
forces
which
roam
the
forest
and
dark
bowers
of
man's
domain.

The
first
few
pages
warn
that
these
enduring
creatures
may
lie
dormant
but
are
never
truly
dead.

They
may
be
recalled
to
active
life
through
the
incantations
presented
in
this
book.

It
is
through
recitation
of
these
passages
that
the
demons
are
given
license
to
possess
the
living.
Hey!

What
did
you
do
that
for?

It
was
just
getting
good!
I
just
don't
want
to
hear
it
anymore,
that's
all.
Ooooooooo
Scotty,
c'mon.

Leave
her
alone,
man.
Hey,
c'mon.

I
just
want
to
hear
the
rest
of
it.

No
big
deal.
Shut
it
off!

Shut
it
off!

Shut
it
off!!!
Cheryl.

Where're
you
going?
I
can't
believe
this.

Scott,
you
knew
not
to
play
that!
I
mean
c'mon,
you
knew
it
was
upsetting
her.

You
just
don't
know
when
you're
taking
something
too
far.
Hey,
don't
give
me
that!

You
were
playing
it
too.

You
could
of
shut
it
off.

I
mean
big
deal!

She's
nuts.

I
mean
it's
just
a
joke,
c'mon!

Jesus
Christ.

She
acts
like
she's
three
years
old
or
something.
Listen.

Why
don't
we
stay
up
for
a
while
and
listen
to
the
storm?
All
right,
yeah.

Let
me
check
on
Cheryl
first
to
see
if
she's
Ok.
Aha!
Ohh!

Stealing
from
the
blind,
hunh?

This
is
for
you.
Ash,
how
sweet
of
you.
Would
you
put
it
on?
Oh
yeah,
sure.

I
was
going
to
give
it
to
you
before
we
came
up
here,
but
things
got
so
hectic,
this
is
really
the
first
chance
we've
had
to
be
alone.

Take
a
look.
Oh
Ash!

It's
beautiful.

I
really
love
it.

I'll
never
take
it
off.
Join
us!
Is
anybody
out
there?
I
know
someone's
out
there.

I
heard
you.

I
heard
you
in
the
cellar.
Ashley!!!
What
the
hell
happened
to
you?

What's
the
matter
with
you?

Did
something
in
the
woods
do
this
to
you?
No!

It
was
the
woods
themselves!

They're
alive
Ashley!

The
trees!
They're
alive.
Ash.

Why
don't
I
take
her
in
the
back
room
so
she
can
lie
down.
I'm
not
lying
down!

I
want
to
get
out
of
here.

I
want
to
leave
this
place
right
now.

Right
now
Ashley!
Wait
a
minute.

I
sure
as
hell
am
not
leaving
any
place
tonight.
Cheryl.
Cheryl.
Cheryl,
there's
nothing
out
there.

Trees
do
not
attack
people.
Ashley!

Will
you
drive
me
into
town
or
not?
What?

Right
now?!

Look,
sure,
sure,
I'll
take
you
into
town,
but
just
listen
to
what
you're
saying.
I
don't
care
how
it
sounds.

I
wanna
get
out
of
this
place
right
now.
Ok,
maybe
you
could
stay
somewhere
in
town
tonight.
I
know
it's
not
gonna
start.

It's
not
gonna
let
us
leave.
Why
are
you
stopping?
Wait
here
a
minute.
Do
you
see
something?

Where're
you
going?

Ashley?



Ashley?
It's
not
going
to
let
us
go!

It's
not
going
to
let
us
go!
I
told
you!

I
told
you!

It's
not
going
to
let
us
go!

Why
won't
you
listen
to
me?


I
know
now
that
my
wife
has
become
host
to
a
Candarian
demon.

I
fear
that
the
only
way
to
stop
those
possessed
by
the
spirits
of
the
book
is
through
the
act
of
bodily
dismemberment.

I
believe
now
to
avoid
this
horror,
but
for
myself,
I
have
seen
the
dark
shadows
moving
in
the
woods
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
whatever
I
have
resurrected
through
this
book
is
sure
to
come
calling...
for
me.
Ok,
ah,
let
me
think.

Ummm...
It's
a
seven.
Oh!

What
suit?
Ahh...
diamonds.

N-n-no
wait!

Ummm,
hearts!
Oh
My!

It's
seven
of
hearts!

You're
right!
Hey
Ash!

I
guessed
the
card
right!
Yeah...
truly
amazing
Linda.
I
don't
know.

I
don't
know,
but
I
think
it's
really
some
sort
of
extra
sense
or
something,
you
know,
like
ESP.
Ok,
try
this
one.
Ok...
It's
a
seven.
I
don't
believe
it!
...
of
spades.

Queen
of
Spades.

Four
of
Hearts.

Eight
of
Spades.
Two
of
Spades.

Jack
of
Diamonds.

Jack
of
Clubs!
Why
have
you
disturbed
our
sleep?

Awakened
us
from
our
ancient
slumber?

You
will
die!

Nightmare
is
before
you.

One
by
one
we
will
take
you.
What
happened
to
her?
Did
you
see
her
eyes?

Oh
Ash,
I'm
scared.

What's
wrong
with
her?
Cheryl!

Stop
it!
Join
us!
Ash.

I
think
we
ought
to
get
out
of
here.
Yeah.
We
still
have
a
few
more
hours
before
morning.
I
don't
think
I
can
wait
that
long.
You
have
to.

We
all
have
to!

And
then
in
the
morning,
we'll
get
in
the
car,
and
we'll
take
the
bridge.

And-
Why
does
she
keep
making
those
horrible
noises?
I
don't
know!
Her
eyes!

Her
eyes...
For
God's
Sake!

What
happened
to
her
eyes?
Everything's
going
to
be
all
right.
Scotty.

I-I
think
there's
something's
out
there.
Go
to
bed,
and
get
some
sleep.

Ok?
Shelly?
Thank
you.

I
don't
know
what
I
would
have
done
if
I
remained
on
those
hot
coals,
burning
my
pretty
flesh.

You
have
pretty
skin.
Give
it
to
us.
Join
us.

Join
us...
Hit
her!

Hit
it!
Scott.
Yeah?
What
are-

What
are
we
going
to
do?
We're
going
to
bury
her.
We
can't
bury
Shelly.

She's
a-
she's
a
friend
of
ours.
Yeah,
she's
dead.

Shelly's
dead.

We
gotta
bury
her
now.
Linda's
still
sleeping.

I
think
once
her
leg-
I'm
getting
out
of
here.
Scott,
we
can't
take
Linda
anywhere
with
her
leg
like
that.

We
don't
even
know
if
there
is
anyway
back
besides
the
bridge.
Maybe
there's
a
hiking
trail,
or
an
old
road
or
some
other
way
around
the
cliff.

I
mean
there's
gotta
be
another
way
besides
the
bridge.
Listen
to
me.

Linda
cannot
walk
with
her
leg
like
that.

She
can't
even
stand
up.
Well,
then
we'll
leave
her
here.

Until
we
can
send
somebody
back.
What?

Are
you
crazy?
Look!

I'm
getting
out!

I
don't
care
what
happens
to
her.

She's
your
girlfriend,
you
take
care
of
her.

I'm
getting
the
hell
out
of
here.

Right
now.
Soon
all
of
you
will
be
like
me.

And
then
we'll
lock
you
up
in
the
cellar.

Hahahahaha
Ash!

Ash!
Oh
My
God!
Help
me!
Scotty.

You're
going
to
be
Ok.

You're
going
to
be
just
fine.
You'll
see.
Ash.

It's
not
going
to
let
us
leave.

Cheryl-

Cheryl
was
right,
we're
all
going
to
die
here!
No,
we're
not
going
to
die.
We're
all
going
to
die.

All
of
us!
No,
we're
not
going
to
die!

We're
not
going
to
die!

We're
gonna
get
out
of
here.

Now
listen
to
me
Scotty.

Is
there
a
way
around
the
bridge?

Scotty!

Listen
to
me
please
for
God's
Sake!

Scott!!
Ash.

Ash.

I
don't
wanna
die.

You're
not
going
to
leave
me
are
you
Ash?

Are
you?
I
don't
wanna
die.

You're
not
going
to
leave
me
here
are
you?

Are
you
Ash?

Hahahahaha
Scotty!

Now
c'mon
listen
to
me
for
God's
Sake!

Is
there
a
way
around
the
bridge?
There's
a
way.

The
trail.

But
the
trees
Ash.

They
know.

Don't
you
see
Ash?

They're
alive!
Shut
up
will
you?

Shut
up!
Kill
her!

Kill
her!
Kill
her
if
you
can,
loverboy.
Now,
forgive
me
Linda.
Oh
Ash,
help
me
please!

Ash,
help
me
please
Ash.

Oh
Ash.

Please
don't
let
them
take
me
away
again.

Please.
No,
I
won't.

I
won't.

I
promise.
Ashley.

Ashley,
help
me.

Let
me
out
of
here.

Ashley?

Ash,
help
me.
Let
me
out
of
here.

I'mI'm
all
right
now,
I'm
all
right
now
Ashley,
I'm
all
right.

Unlock
this
chain
and
let
me
out.
Cheryl?

Cheryl?
I'm
all
right
now
Ashley!

Come
unlock
the
chain
and
let
me
out!

Hahaha

I'm
all
right
now.

It's
your
sister,
Cheryl.
Ah
you
bastards!

Why
are
you
torturing
me
like
this?

Why?
Shut
up!
We're
going
to
get
you.

We're
going
to
get
you.
Not
another
peep.

Time
to
go
to
sleep.

We-ahhahahahaha
Useless!

Useless!

In
time
it
will
come
for
him
and
then
it
will
come
for
you!
Here.

Here.



Now,
the
sun
will
be
up
in
an
hour
or
so
and
we
can
all
get
out
of
here
together.

You,
me,
Linda,
Shelly.

Hmm..
Well...
not
Shelly,
she-

We'll
all
be
going
home
together.

Wouldn't
you
like
to
be
going
home?

I
bet
you'd
like
that,
wouldn't
you?

Scott?
Join
us!

Join
us!
Oh
Linda...
Back
door.
Where
did
I
see
that
box
of
shells?
We're
going
to
get
you.

We're
going
to
get
you.
Shut
up,
Linda!

Shut
up!


So
sweet
of
you...


...is
through
bodily
dismemberment.


Hit
her!

Hit
it!
Oh
come
on...
come
on...

don't...
like
this...
Linda....
