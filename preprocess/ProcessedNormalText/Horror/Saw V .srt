the
same
helplesness
But

it's
onto
you.
I
call
it
justice.
Now

five
years
of
what
should

been
A
technicality
gave
you
freedom,
but
it
inhibited
you
from
understanding
Today,
I
offer
you
true
freedom.
In
thirty
seconds,
to
touch
your
body.
Within
sixty
seconds,
it
will
cut
you
in
half.
To
avoid
the
pendulum,
all
you
have
to
do
...your
hands.
You
must
insert
your
hands
and
push
the
buttons
Your
bones
will
be
crushed
to
dust.
Will
you
destroy
the
things
that
have
Make
your
choice.
No!
It
was
an
accident!
God!
Please!
Wait!
Ok,

Where

NO
SIGNAL
Hello,
Agent
Strahm.
If
you're
hearing
this,
then
you've
finally
found
But
is
the
discovery
of
my
body
enough?
Or
will
your
insatiable
hunger
to
uncover
the
truth
push
you
deeper
into
the
abyss?
Heed
my
warning:
do
not
proceed.
For
this
room
can
either
be
you
sanctuary,
The
choice
is
yours.
Fuck
you.
Hey!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Go,
go!
Its
ok.
Lets
go.
Move
it,
move,
move!

Wheres
my
dad?
Wheres
my
mum?
-
Hoffman.
Did
you
get
them
all?
What
the
hell
happened?
I
tried
to
help.
He
didnt
make
it.
Nobody
made
it.
We
got
a
live
one!
Hello?
Right
away.
Miss
Tuck.
Have
a
seat.
Its
nice
to
meet
you
Mr.
Feldman.
Why
am
I
here?
I
represent
your
ex-husband
John.
In
the
event
of
his
death,
You
can
understand
my
surprise,
when
I
found
out,
John
left
something
for
you.
If
youre
watching
this
Jill,
Im
long
gone
from
this
world.
You
are
my
heart,
you
always
have
been,
you
always
will
be.
Im
not
going
to
try
to
explain
the...
...my
actions
of
leave.
Suffice
it
to
say
that
I
find
it
difficult
for
what
happened
at
the
clinic.
I
permited,
indeed
encouraged
your
decisions
I
saw
a
danger
and
I
should
have
acted
sooner.
Im
leaving
you
a
box
today
Even
though
you
and
I
dont
always
see
I
deeply
believe
in
you
and
I
believe,
that
you
will
know
Miss
Tuck,
if
you
dont
mind,
Thank
you
for
your
time
Mr.
Feldman.
I
want
to
thank
you
all
and
Id
like
to
be
the
first
to
say
that
the
Jigsaw
murders
are
over.
Why
isnt
this
a
joint
press
conference
with
the
FBI?
Please
not
today
miss
Jenkins.
The
officers
who
gave
their
lives
But
today
Id
like
to
offer
special
honor
to
the
detective,
who
has
been
on
this
case
Who
proved
through
hard
work
and
dedication
that
the
people
who
died
Today
we
honor
the
newly
promoted
?Hes
all
right.
God
bless
him.?
Thank
you.
Throughout
this
ordeal,
if
weve
learnt
anything,
...human
life
is
sacred.
And
weve
learnt
that
every
day.
Life
should
be
cherished.
Justice
is
the
backbone
to
every
peacefull
society.
And
I
believe
that
true
justice
has
been
served.
Doctor
Rayburn,
53.
Doctor
Rayburn...
Sorry
about
agent
Perez.
Shouldnt
you
be
resting?
Im
fine
Erickson.
?Knock
it
out
Peter.?
I
was
supposed
to
die
in
that
trap.
You
never
should
have
been
there
without
back-up.
I
want
to
talk
to
Jill
Tuck
one
last
time.
Youre
not
longer
handling
the
case,
Peter.
What?
Read
it.
Over
a
dozen
dead
bodies
Two
of
which
were
cops.
Jigsaw
is
dead.
By
endangering
yourself
and
others
-
...you
are
off
the
case.
Mine.
Im
sorry
Peter,
its
over.
Hello
agent
Perez
and
welcome
to
the
world,
Heed
my
warning
agent
Perez.
-
Open
the
door.
I
am
truly
sorry
about
agent
Perez.
She
said
your
name
you
know...
Last
thing
she
said
wais
"detective
Hoffman".
Why
did
she
said
that?
-
I
dont
know.
How
did
you
walk
out
of
that
building?
How
did
you?
On
a
gurney,
with
a
fucking
hole
in
my
throat!
And
you...
couple
of
scratches,
and
a
story
about
Is
this
you
theorising
again?
Im
not
talking
about
him.
My
department
is
gone.
Theres
no
one
left
Besides
you.
Ive
been
chasing
Jigsaw
from
the
beginning.
And
I
got
him.
So
unless
youve
got
something
else
to
say...
...back
the
fuck
off.
And
read
the
papers.
Oh
my
god.
What
is
this?
Hey,
dont
move.
What
did
you
do
to
me?
I
didnt
do
anything.
Its
Jigsaw.
-
What
is
it?
This
is
what
he
does.
No
it
is
not
Jigsaw.
He
is
dead.
Havent
you
watched
TV
lately?
Yeah,
well
whoever
it
is.
Theyre
watching
us.
Make
sure,
we
follow
the
rules.
Which
are
what?
I
wouldnt
do
that
if
I
were
you.
Unless
you
want
your
head
to
pop
off
How
do
you
know
that?
Because
I
have
eyes.
One
pulled
pin
starts
the
timer
for
all
of
us.
You
dont
want
to
do
that,
This
shit
is
freakin'
me
out,
dude.
Hello
and
welcome.
From
birth,
you've
all
given
Yet,
through
poor
moral
decisions,
you've
used
these
advantages
to
selfishly
Well
today,
this
singular
way
of
thinking
Today,
five
will
become
one
You
are
all
connected.
It
can
be
pulled
so
tight
that
you
The
only
way
to
remove
the
collar
is
with
the
keys
However,
if
one
of
you
moves
to
retrieve
a
key,
In
choosing
how
to
react
to
the
situation,
your
life-long
instincts
will
tell
you
to
do
one
thing,
but
I
implore
you
to
do
the
opposite.
Let
the
games
begin.
Somebody
has
to
die.
No,
no,
it
says
don't
listen
to
your
instincts.
-
That
means
don't
go
for
the
keys.
How
are
we
supposed
to
live
Maybe
it's
testing
our
endurance.
We've
got
to
move
back.
No,
it
didn't
say
anything
about
those
jars.
They're
a
nail-bomb.
How
the
fuck
do
you
know
that?
She's
a
fire
inspector.
How
do
you
know
me?
Hey,
man,
she's
asking
you
a
question.
How
do
you
know
her?!
-
Answer
me!
-
Maybe
we
can
figure
this
out.
We're
all
connected.
-
What
did
you
do?
It,
it,
it
said
we
were
all
born
with
advantages,
right?
Me
was
born
for
money.
-
I'm
not.
Nice
fucking
try,
Nancy
Drew.
Well,
then
what
does
it
mean?
We
all
did
something
wrong
That
doesnt
have
to
mean
money.
What
are
you
not
telling
us?
Huh?
You
know
about
her.
What
do
you
know
about
the
rest
of
us?
-
Would
you
fucking
talk
to
me?!
-
I
am
fucking
relaxed!
The
less
you
know
about
me,
the
better.
The
reason
why
you
fucked
up
your
charm
existences
Fuck
you.
Fuck
you!
Been
play
with
matches
again,
have
we?
Fuck
all
of
you!
Not
yet!
Unless
you
wanna
be
shredded
when
What
are
you
doing?
Being
smart.
Special
agent
Strahms
office.
This
is
detective
Hoffman.
He
is
not,
but
i
can
connect
you

Hes

all
enquiries.
You
have
reached
the
voicemail
box
of
Yeah,
this
is
detective
Hoffman.
I
needed
to
discuss
something
with
agent
Strahm,
Could
you
give
me
a
call?
There
you
are.
....
...
...
...
Peter.
-
Cowan,
take
it
to
Alistair.
What
do
you
do
here?
Just
grabbing
some
stuff
from
the
office.
Taking
some
time-off,
huh?
Yeah,
well
I
have
to
heal
up,
you
know?
You
know?
Ill
keep
in
touch.
Hoffman
weve
got
another
body.
Looks
like
another
Jigsaw
victim.
Youre
after
this?
Typical
???
murder
convict.
Served
five
years,
I
know
him.
My
sisters
ex-boyfriend.
This
is
the
guy
that
murdered
your
sister?
He
was
sentenced
to
25
years.
Well
Id
say
justice
was
served.
You
killed
him.
Made
it
look
like
Jigsaw
trap.
I
got
you.
Not
yet!
Dont
close
the
door.
-
Do
you
know
that
for
sure?
What
we
need
to
do
is
figure
out
-
Well,
we
know
the
dead
woman
worked
for
the
fire
department.
-
She
got
canned
a
month
ago.
You're
responsible
for
this
sh...!
-
I'm
closing
the
door!
I'm
gonna
close
the
fucking
door!
Please.
What's
your
story?
I
work
for
the
Department
of
City
Planning.
-
Married?
Kids?
Your
turn.
Youre
not
gonna
tell
them
about
daddy?
My
dad
is...
Richard
Gibbs.
You
remember
the
Cougars?
He's
been
trying
to
build
a
new
stadium
for
years.
Little
did
he
know
all
he
had
to
do
was
And
you?
What
about
you?
What
sort
of
shady
shit
have
you
been
up
to?
I'm
a
senior
VP
for
a
real
estate
development
company.
So
you're
boring,
too.
The
Marshford
group.
You
know
you
can't
get
permit
in
this
town
-
Right?
What
about
you?
No
wife,
no
kids
that
I
know
of,
no
job.
Trust
him,
baby.
Anyone
surprised.
I'm
so
fucking
sick
of
your
Its
your
turn.
I'm
an
investigative
journalist
for
The
Herald.
The
Harold?
xxx
you
work
for
a
gossip
rag?
Bite
your
fucking
tongue.
What
the
hell
are
in
those
jars?
Let's
do
this
fucking
thing
before
the
bombs
go
off.
Fuck!
Hello
and
welcome
to
the
next
lesson.
These
walls
hold
four
chambers.
These
chambers
offer
safety.
However,
to
access
them,
a
key
is
needed.
but
only
three
of
the
keys
will
fit
the
locks.
These
keys
are
in
the
glass
jars
Move
quickly,
though.
Because
when
the
clock
ticks
down,
the
explosives
in
the
corners
of
the
room
will
detonate.
With
only
three
points
of
safety,
which
of
you
will
be
the
odd
man
out?
Make
your
choice.
Fuck!
Fuck
its
blank.
Mr.xxx
is
not
going
anywhere!
-
Stop
it!
Blank.
Blank.
Shit.
I
got
it.
Yes!
Better
luck
next
time
you
rich
boy.
Survival
of
the
fittest
my
ass.
Wait!
After
Seth
you
were
involved
in
every
investigation.
When
did
you
first
meet
Jigsaw?
OUT
OF
ORDER
Do
you
mind
?!
-
Going
up?
What
story
are
you
going
to?
I
think
were
both
going
to
the
same
place.
You
know,
why
youre
here,
dont
you?
They
say
imitation
is
the
sincerest
form
of
flattery.
But
I
find
it
somewhat...
distasteful.
To
be
given
credit
for
work
that's
not
mine.
...
Especially
inferior
work.
Like
you,
I
know
what
it's
like
to
lose
family.
I
know
what
it's
like
not
to
be
able
It's
a
powerless
feeling.
I
wouldn't
do
that.
Hair-trigger.
What
do
you
see?
Vengeance
can
change
a
person.
Make
you
into
something
you
never
thought
But,
unlike
you,
I've
never
killed
anyone.
I
give
people
a
chance.
-
You
call
this
a
chance?
Our
game's
just
begun.
Our
game?
You
dont
even
know
me.
No.
I
know
you.
I
know
you.
I
know
about
your
sister.
I
know
how
you
cared
for
her.
I
know
she
was
your
only
family.
Leave
me
alone!
No!
You
sit
in
bars
until
closing.
You
drink
so
you
can
sleep.
You
stagger
to
your
car
and
then
you
And
I
discovered
what
you
do
for
recreation.
You
can
dispense
justice.
You
can
give
people
a
chance
And
by
the
way:
the
blade
on
your
pendulum
was
inferior.
If
you
want
a
true
edge,
you
have
to
use
tempered
steel.
Tempering's
better
for
the
long
haul.
You
in
this
for
the
long
haul,
detective?
I've
been
a
cop
for
20
years.
Then
you
and
I
both
know
the
statistics
67.5%
of
criminals
are
back
in
prison
What
do
you
want
from
me?!
So
you
might
look
at
what
you
did
to
Seth
She
was
my
only
family.
He
didn't
deserve
a
chance!
Everybody
deserves
a
chance!
You
didn't
see
the
blood!
You
didn't
see
what
he
fucking
did
to
her!
Killing
is
distasteful...!
To
me.
There
is
a
better,
more
efficient,
way.
What
do
you
see?
Look!
-
What
do
you
see?
I
want
to
know
if
you
have
what
it
takes
to
survive.
Fuck
you.
Fuck
you.
You
see,
it's
a
different
method
that
I'm
talking
about.
If
the
subject
survives
my
method,
he
or
she
is
instantly
rehabilitated.
Now,
you
want
a
chance?
You
want
a
chance?
I'll
give
you
a
chance.
I
am
the
man
you
call
"Jigsaw".
It's
your
duty
to
bring
me
in.
But
I
know
who
you
are
and
I
know
what
youve
done.
So
this
is
blackmail?
No,
no,
no...
This
is
redemption.
Just
giving
you
an
option.
That's
all.
Now,
you
can
arrest
me,
but
in
doing
so,
your
life
ends
as
you
know
it.
Or...
you
could
explore
a
method
of
rehabilitation
Or
I
can
kill
you
right
now.
But
you're
not
a
true
killer.
That's
your
dilemma.
And
the
information
I
have
on
you
And
it
will
be
released
in
the
event
of
my
disappearance.
They'll
never
believe
your
word
over
mine.
You're
willing
to
take
that
risk?
The
risk
of
ruining
your
own
life
in
order
to
protect
a
corrupt
legal
system
How
would
your
sister
feel?
We're
at
a
crossroads,
detective.
Make
your
choice.
Did
you
help
Jigsaw
get
hold
of
them?
Detective
Hoffman,
You
had
something
you
needed
to
discuss
Yes,
I
stopped
by
agent
Strahms
room
tonight
-
I
hope
hes
all
right.
Agent
Strahm
was
theorizing
...other
than
Amanda
Young.
Someone
who
might
be
currently
unknown.
Did
he
ever
metioned
anything
like
that
to
you?
No.
But
then
again,
I
knew
the
case.
Yeah,
well,
maybe
you
can
get
him
Will
do.
And
in
his
theorizing,
who
exactly
did
you
suspect
to
be
an
accomplice?
Well,
he
suspected
someone
on
the
inside.
Someone
with
access.
That's
an
interesting
theory.
Detective...
what
do
you
say
we
reconnect
in
the
morning?
You
got
it.
God.
The
guy
was
an
asshole
but
he
was
smart.
We
could
have
used
him.
Well,
someone
had
to
die.
Would
you
rather
it
have
been
you?
How
did
they
get
you?
I
will
kill
you!
I
will
kill
you!
?all
right,
kill
me?
Hello
Paul.
Did
you
cut
yourself
because
you
truly
wanted
to
die
or
did
you
just
want
some
attention?
Tonight,
you'll
show
me.
If
you
want
to
live,
you'll
have
to
cut
yourself
again.
How
much
blood
will
you
shed
to
stay
alive,
Paul?
I
didn't
expect
to
feel
any
remorse.
The
heart
cannot
be
involved.
Emotionally,
there
can
be
nothing
there.
It
can
never
be
personal.
-
Lets
go.
Youre
not
done
yet.
Tonight,
you
will
see
the
difference
There's
another
detective
His
name's
Tapp
He's
smart.
He's
getting
closer.
I
know
who
he
is.
I
need
you
to
lead
him
to
somewhere
for
me.
A
doctor.
A
healer
who
needs
some
healing.
Is
this
yours,
doctor?
You
supplied
these
police
files,
didnt
you?
Youre
assuming
this
is
gonna
play
out
I
assume
nothing.
I
anticipate
the
possibilities
Then
why
do
you
need
Amanda
in
the
game?
To
ensure
that
the
rules
are
followed.
-
She
won't
make
decisions
for
anyone.
...offer
choices.
A
little
to
your
left.
That
leaves
it
up
to
chance.
If
you're
good
at
anticipating
the
human
mind,
it
leaves
nothing
to
chance.
Its
time.
Jesus
Christ!
Great.
More
bombs.
All
right,
what
did
you
do
to
get
here?
I...
I
did
something
...and
a
bunch
of
people
were
killed.
I
didnt
mean
to.
There're
still
deads.
-
And
that's
why
you're
here?
Shouldn't
you
have
gone
to
jail
Nobody
else
knows.
Somebody
does.
I
didn't
kill
anybody
I
wasnt.
I
grant
building
permits.
And
yes,
some
people
might
have
been
more
deserving
than
others.
So
if
someone
tells
you
different,
Or
naive.
Or
both.
Bullshit.
You
take
bribes,
you're
a
fucking
liar,
Yeah...
But
I'm
sure
she's
not
exactly
No,
Im
not.
I
don't
give
a
shit.
Close
the
fucking
door,
Hello
and
welcome.
You
must
all
be
eager
to
learn
The
game
before
you
is
designed
to
bridge
the
gap
between
you
all.
In
order
to
open
the
five
locks
on
the
door
the
five
electrical
circuits
The
only
way
to
do
this
is
to
find
a
way
Close
the
circuits,
and
the
door
will
open.
But
you
must
work
quickly
for
in
three
minutes,
an
electrical
current
will
surge
Who
will
bridge
the
gap?
The
choice
is
yours.
Jesus
Christ!
Its
not
gonna
reach.
Come
on!
No,
don't
do
it!
Please,
no.
You
killed
her.
I
didnt
trust
her.
Jesus
Christ
what
is
it
with
you
too?
Just
shut
up
and
help
me
with
the
body.
Wait,
wait.
No.
Oh
my
god,
its
a
hook.
Stick
it
in
her
head
or
we
dont
get
out!
Just
do
it!
Come
in.
Sir,
thats
Jill
Tuck.
Good
evening.
Thank
you
for
seeing
me
so
late
today.
Not
a
problem.
That
will
be
all.
Please,
have
a
seat.
So,
what
do
you
need
from
us?
I
think
I'm
being
followed.
Well,
that
sounds
more
like
police
work,
Ms.
Tuck.
I
don't
think
they
can
help
me.
Because...?
Because
it's
you.
The
FBI.
I
dont
understand.
It
started
when
John
was
first
identified
as
Jigsaw
killer.
It
didn't
surprise
me
then,
but
I'm
still
being
followed.
By
who,
Ms.
Tuck?
I
think
it's
the
agent
who
interrogated
me.
Agent
Strahm.
And
why
would
he
be
following
you?
I
don't
know.
Who
else
have
you
told
about
this?
Only
you.
What's
going
on
with
Amanda?
Didn't
you
tell
me
the
only
way
to
truly
offer
enlightment
is
by
detaching
emotionally?
But
you
can
have
something
Amanda
doesn't.
?A
longevity?.
Thats
the
greatest
protection.
That's
what
I've
given
you.
I
need
you
to
set
up
a
game.
It
may
not
be
entirely
clear,
to
you
right
now.
But
I
assure
you
the
people
being
tested
Theyre
connected.
So
in
the
end,
all
the
pieces
will
fit
together.
And
it'll
be
clear.
Who
are
you!
Amanda
will
fail
you.
We'll
see.
What
are
you
doing?
-
Whats
this?
Its
time
to
play
a
game.
Help!
Help
me!
What
is
it
Christ!
Why
are
you
keeping
me
here!
We
were
all
supposed
to
die.
Jigsaw
is
fucking
testing
you!
Where
is
my
daughter!
He
didnt
make
it.
Nobody
made
it.
You
were
supposed
to
be
the
hero!
Peter,
where
the
hell
are
you?
Hello?
You
have
reached
the
voicemail
of
a
special
agent
Peter
Strahm.
Cowan,
I
want
to
put
a
locate
on
Strahms
mobile
phone.
Right
away
sir.
Call
me
right
back.
All
right.
...
...
There
you
are,
Strahm.
All
right.
Back
up.
What
the
hell
is
that?
It's
our
next
nightmare.
There
are
blades
in
here.
It's
connected
to
the
door.
When
the
beaker
fills
up,
the
door
opens.
Fills
with
what?
Blood.
Our
blood.
I'm
thinking...
our
wrists
are
supposed
to
go
in
there
Wait.
Why
can't
we
just
use
the
water
from
the
other
room?
No,
it's
locks
are
closed.
We
need
to
close
that
door.
So
what?
We
fight
to
the
death
and
the...
the
winner
gets
freedom
Wait,
wait,
wait.
-
Do
you
still
have
the
keys
from
that
first
room?
-
Try
one
of
them
on
that
door.
No,
no.
It
might.
Its
not
even
the
same
lock.
Why
are
there
five
slots
in
this
machine?
Shouldn't
there
be
only
one?
They
all
would've
worked.
-
Where
are
you
going?
I
don't
think
this
is
a
good
idea.
The
tub
wasn't
meant
for
one
person.
We
were
supposed
to
hold
one
cable
each
It
was
meant
for
five
people.
We
only
needed
one
key
in
the
first
room.
They
all
worked
and
any
one
of
them
would've
opened
every
collar.
In
the
second
room,
the
three
chambers
We
were
supposed
to
work
together
so
we
all
survived.
Thats
the
game.
"Your
lifelong
instincts
will
tell
you
to
do
one
thing
Oh
god.
Whoops...
Yeah,
big
fucking
whoops.
Hello
and
welcome.
This
journey
has
been
one
of
discovery
and
hopefully
you've
discovered
The
human
body,
for
instance,
It
contains
approximately
ten
pints
of
blood.
Yet
it
is
still
able
to
operate
with
just
half
of
that.
The
device
before
you
is
one
of
sacrifice.
A
sacrifice
of
blood.
In
order
to
open
the
door,
A
level
that
is
of
no
coincidence.
This
amount
can
come
from
anyone
of
you.
What
does
matter
is
time.
For
in
15
minutes,
if
the
beaker
is
not
filled,
and
the
doors
will
be
sealed
forever.
So
now
I
ask
you,
Fuck!
Fuck!
All
right.
So
one
person
can
fill
the
beaker
Or
two
people
can
fill
it
with
5
pints...
...and
maybe
live.
What
are
we
gonna
do?
I
lied.
I
know
the
investigative
journalist
in
there.
What'd
you
do?
A
dealer
gave
me...
an
ounce
of
heroin
But
it
was...
Oh,
god!
It
wasn't
abandoned.
...died.
And
the
Feds
got
involved
and
I
got
caught
but
I
made
a
deal
But
the
guy
who
hired
me
disappeared
The
fire.
The
fire
inspector
who
worked
The
city
planner
who
pushed
through
The
journalist
that
beared
the
investigated
story.
The
rich
kid
junkie
who
was
the
patsy.
And
the
real-estate
developer
who
set
it
all
in
motion.
We
killed
eight
people
Why
did
they
all
do
it?
Was
it
for
money?
There
was
eight
people
still
living
in
that
building!
I
cant
do
this
alone!
Look
at
me!
-
I
cant!
We
have
to
do
it
on
three.
One!
Two!
I
cant
enter
the
hole!
Three!
Hello
agent
Strahm.
If
you
are
hearing
this,
then
you
have
once
again
Or
so
you
think.
But
I
ask
you:
As
the
old
addage
goes,
"Fool
me
once,
shame
on
you".
"Fool
me
twice,
shame
on
me."
The
situation
you
find
yourself
in
is
one
of
trust.
So
I
ask
you,
Special
Agent
Strahm:
The
only
way
to
survive
this
room
Pain
will
be
incurred,
We
did
it.
We
won.
We
won.
I
got
you,
you
motherfucker!
Drop
it!
Who
did
this
to
you?
We
won.
We
won.
We
worked
together...
...in
it...
I
need
immediate
medical
assistance.
Jesus,
Peter.
Tell
me
how
to
open
it.
How
do
I
open
it?
However,
if
you
choose
not
to,
Your
body
will
never
be
found.
I
ask
you,
Special
Agent
Strahm:
Have
you
learned
enough
to
trust
me?
-
Will
you
heed
my
warning?
For
if
you
do
not...
...this
room
will
forever
be
your
tomb.
And
my
legacy
will
become
yours.
If
you're
good
at
anticipating
the
human
mind...
I
think
Im
being
followed.
Who
would
be
following
you?
I
want
to
talk
to
Jill
Tuck
one
last
time.
He
suspected
someone
on
the
inside.
It
leaves
nothing
to
chance.
We
were
all
supposed
to
die.
You
were
supposed
to
be
the
hero.
Make
your
choice.
Cowan,
it
is
Ericksson.
I
want
you
to
put
out
an
A.P.B.
Suspects
name
is
Peter
Strahm.
Yeah,
that's
right.
Special
Agent
Peter
Strahm.
Tell
me
how
to
stop
it
you
son
of
a
bitch!
I
know
who
you
are!
