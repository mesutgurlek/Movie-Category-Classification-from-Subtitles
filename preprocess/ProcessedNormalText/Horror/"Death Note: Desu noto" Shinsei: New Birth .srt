Shinigami

What
?
Two
death's-heads
?
Hehe,
I
win
again
!
Lucky
me
!
Hey,
Ryuk.
Wanna
play
?
Join
in
once
in
a
while.
No
thanks.
I'll
pass.
So.
I
didn't
even
do
anything
but
he
got
all
pissed.
Really
?
Then
what
?
Yagami-kun...
are
you
listening
?
Will
you
translate
that
last
part
?
You
should
follow
god's
teachings.
If
you
do,
the
sea
will
remain
quiet
and
the
storm
will
not
come.
Today
at
11a.m...
at
an
apartment
complex
in
Yokoshama
in
the
Karnagawa
Prefecture,
Police
have
ruled
the
killing
to
be
a
homicide
and
are...
Our
next
story...
Today
in
Shibuya,
Tokyo.
Naoki
Toiuji,
age
35,
was
arrested
for
suspicion
of
murdering
his
roommate,
a
25-year
old
woman.
Day
after
day...
The
same
old
thing.
What
a
waste...
This
world
is...
Rotten...
Rebirth
You
went
to
see
that
?
What
a
waste
of
time.
I
should
get
a
refund.
"Death
Note"...
?
A
Notebook
of
Death
?
"How
to
Use
It...
The
human
whose
name
is
written
in
this
note
shall...
Die."
Ridiculous.
Really,
talk
about
sick.
This
is
as
bad
as
those
chain-letters.
The
person
whose
name
is
written
dies,
my
ass.
Sheesh,
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
me.
"This
note
will
not
take
effect
unless
the
writer
has
the
person's
Therefore,
people
sharing
the
same
name
will
not
be
affected."
"If
the

of

not
specified,

Hmm.
So
you
can
let
people
die
peacefully,
Impressive
that
someone
would
put
so
Write
in
their
name,
and
they
die...
?
Really,
how
stupid.
Wait
a
minute.
If
someone
actually
dies,
would
that
make
me
a
murderer
?
Heh,
as
if
it
could
really
happen.
The
man
who
indiscriminately
killed
and
wounded
is
still
barricaded
inside
this
nursery
school
The
Metropolitan
Police
have
determined
the
man's
identity
They
are
currently
trying
to
negotiate
with
him.
Forty
seconds
and
it's
a
heart
attack,
right
?
...and
we
don't
know
that
as
of
yet.
I'm
so
worried
about
the
hostages.
Me
too.
That's
the
report
from
the
scene.
Thank
you
very
much.
What
are
you
thoughts,
Hashimoto-san
?
I
hope
the
situation
is
resolved
soon.
In
the
end,
nothing
happened,
I
knew
it.
What
was
I
expecting
?
Ah,
wait
a
minute
!
We
have
a
new
development
!
The
hostages
are
coming
out
!
They
all
seem
to
be
all
right.
And
noe
the
police
are
going
in
!
Will
Yes
!
This
message
just
in
!
The
captor
has
died
inside
the
nursery
school
!
It
appears
the
suspect
is
dead
!
Dead
?!
The
police
are
emphasizing
that
they
did
not
shoot
him.
Could
that
mean
he
committed
suicide
?
Well,
the
hostages
are
apparently
A
heart
attack...
N-no
!
A
coincidence
!
It
has
to
be
!
Light
!
It's
6:30pm
already.
You
have
your
prep
course
today,
right
?
Uh,
yeah.
I
was
just
getting
ready
to
go.
Death
Note...
If
this
is
real...
I
should
test
it
one
more
time.
So
I
guess
it
has
to
be
a
criminal
after
all...
But
not
anyone
too
major...
or
the
cops
might
keep
it
secret
for
a
while.
I
need
the
results
right
away.
Hey.
Ryo
baby.
Uh...
what.
Sudou-kun
?
Lend
me
some
money.
Two
thousand
will
do.
Eep.
Again
?
Sudou.
Try
killing
him
?
No.
I
should
avoid
anybody
I
actually
know...
No,
it
doesn't
even
matter.
A
guy
like
that,
nobody's
even
going
to
care...
Sweet
!
We're
going
to
the
arcade
tonight
!
Hey,
Maki.
Wanna
go
on
a
group
date
tomorrow
?
Yeah,
totally
!
My
mom
isn't
here
yet
?
What's
that
bitch
doing,
geez
!
Damn...
Start
looking
around
you...
And
all
you
see
are
people
the
world
Onee-san~
!
How
'bout
havin'
some
fun
with
us
tonight
?
Hey
Taku-san,
you
got
good
taste,
man.
My
name's
Shibuimaru
Takuo,
that's

Come
on,
Onne-san,
how
about
it
?
I...
don't
think
so...
She
doesn't
think
so,
dude
!
Aww,
so
cute
!
Let's
take
off
all
her
clothes
!
Hah.
You
sure
?
Hehehe
!
Please
stop
!
STOP
!!!
Now...
What
will
happen
?!
Wait
!
Taku,
watch
out
!
This...
proves
it
!
The
Death
Note
is
real
!
Oh...
Taku
!
God...
damn
idiot,
what
the
hell
were
you
thinking
?
'Bout
time
I
got
going.
It's
been
five
days.
'Bout
time
I
got
going.
Hm
?
Where
you
off
to,
Ryuk
?
Anyplace
you
go
around
here,
it's
all
barren
anyway.
I
dropped
my
Death
Note.
Whoops
!
You
really
screwed
up,
man
!
Hey,
weren't
you
carrying
around
a
second
You
sayin'
you
lost
both
?
So,
you
got
any
idea
where
you
dropped
it
?
The
Human
World.
Ah
?!
Welcome
Home
!
You're
back
early,
Light.
Yeah.
I'm
home,
mother.
Oh,
yeah.
The
results
of
the
national
exam.
Hurry.
Here.
Oh,
my
!
You
placed
first
again
!
Great
job,
Light
!
Well.
I'll
be
studying
so
don't
bother
me,
okay
?
Sure,
dear.
Oh,
Light.
Is
there
anything
you've
been
wanting
?
Anything
at
all
?
Nothing
in
perticular.
Mom.
I
already
have
what
I
want.
You
seem
to
be
enjoying
it.
Why
are
you
so
suprised
?
I'm
Ryuk,
the
Shinigami
who
dropped
that
notebook.
The
way
you
were
acting
just
now...
I
can
tell
you
know
it
just
any
old
notebook...
right
?
Shinigami,
huh
?
I'm
not
surprised
to
see
you,
Ryuk.
In
fact...
I've
been
waiting
for
you...
Ryuk.
Oh
?
Not
that
I
doubted
that
this
was
a
"Death
God's
notebook",
but
seeing
things
with
my
own
eyes
like
I
see.
Gotta
say.
I'm
the
one
who's
surprised.
I've
heard
of
Death
Notes
reaching
down
But
this
is
the
first
time
I
have
seen
someone
Most
people
would
be
too
scared.
I'm
ready
for
anything,
Ryuk...
I
used
the
notebook,
knowing
it
belonged
to
a
Shinigami...
And
now
the
Sinigami's
here...
What
happens
to
me
now
?
You
going
take
my
soul
or
something
?
Huh
?
What's
that
?
Some
fantasy
you
humans
came
up
with
?
I'm
not
going
to
do
anything
to
you.
The
moment
a
Death
Note
lands
in
the
humans
world...
that
Notebook
belongs
to
the
human
world.
So
it's
yours
now.
Mine...
If
you
don't
want
it,
give
it
to
another
human.
So
there
really
is
no
to
pay
for
using
the
Death
Note
?
One
could
say...
the
terror
and
torment
that
only
humans
who've
And
when
you
die...
I'll
be
the
one
writing
your
name
down
in
my
notebook,
but...
Don't
think
that
any
human
who's
used
the
Death
Note...
can
go
to
Heaven
or
to
Hell.
That's
all.
Something
to
look
forward
to
when
you
die.
Light.
It'll
be
fine.
Answer
it.
What
?
I
brought
some
apples.
You'll
damage
your
eyes.
What's
going
on
?
She
can't
see
him
?
That
originally
was
my
notebook.
Since
you've
used
what
was
my
notebook.
you're
the
only
one
who
can
see
me.
Nobody
else
can
hear
me
either,
of
course.
You
could
say
that
the
Death
Note...
is
the
bond
between
Light
the
human
and
Ryuk
the
Shinigami.
Yum.
Okay,
one
more
question.
Why
did
you
choose
me
?
Hey,
are
you
listening
?
Wow,
human
world
apples
are
great.
What
do
they
call
this
?
Juicy
?
Answer
the
question.
Ha,
I
didn't
choose
you.
All
I
did
was
drop
the
notebook.
You
thought
I
chose
you
cause
you're
so
smart
or
something
?
It
just
happened
to
land
somewhere
around
here
An
you
just
happened
to
pick
it
up.
That's
all.
That's
why
I
wrote
the
instructions
in
English,
Then
why
did
you
drop
it
?
Don't
tell
me
it
was
by
mistake.
after
you
went
wrote
all
those
instructions.
Why
you
ask
?
Because
I
was
bored,
that's
why.
Bored
?
THe
fact
is,
Shinigami
these
days
have
a
lot
to
do
All
they
do
is
nap,
or
gamble.
If
they
see
you
scribbling
humans'
names
"What're
you
working
so
hard
for
?"
and
laugh
at
you.
Writing
names
of
those
in
the
Shinigami
realm
won't
kill
them.
And
killing
people
in
the
human
world
It's
more
fun
to
be
here,
is
how
I
figured
it.
Gotta
say,
though,
you
really
wrote
a
lot
of
names
in
here.
But
how
come
you
only
specified
the
cause
of
death
If
you
don's
specify
the
cause
of
death,
That's
the
best
thing
about
the
Death
Note,
Ryuk.
Huh
?
I've
already
covered
the
most
vicious
criminals.
So
now
the
level
of
atrocity
is
coming
down.
So
what
about
that
?
Even
a
fool
is
going
to
notice
that
somebody
I'm
going
to
make
the
whole
world
know
of
my
existence.
That
somebody
is
passing
righteous
judgment
!
But
I
was
wondering
why
you
would
go
through
all
that
trouble
?
I...
was
also
bored...
Of
course.
I
didn't
believe
it
at
first.
But
that
notebook
has
a
power...
that
makes
anybody
want
to
try
using
it,
at
least
once.
I...
I've
killed...
I've...
killed...
two
people...
It's
life...
It
can't
be
so
easy
Do
I
have
the
right
to
punish
others...
?
No,
wait...
This
is
waht
I've
been
thinking
all
along...
This
world
is
a
rotten
mess.
Those
who
are
rotten
should
die
!
Somebody...
Somebody,
has
to
do
it
!
Even
if
it
costs
them
their
mind
and
soul
!
This
world
needs
to
be
cleansed
!
Suppose
someone
else
picked
up
this
notebook...
could
they
get
rid
of
the
useless
people
of
this
world
?
Of
course
not
!
But
I
can...
I
can
do
it
!
No,
I'm
the
only
one
who
could
do
it
!
I'll
use
the
Death
Note...
to
change
the
world
!!
First,
to
cleanse
the
world
I
wrote
down
the
names
of
all
the
major
criminals.
Soon,
nobody
will
commit
crimes
anymore.
And,
while
people
who
obviously
deserve
to
I'll
gradually
be
killing
off
immoral
people,
and
people
Then
the
world
will
start
to
become
a
better
place.
And
I'll
make
this
a
world
inhabited
by
But
then
you'll
be
the
only
bastard
left...
What
are
you
talking
about,
Ryuk
?
I'm
a
serious,
straight-A
student...
And
I..
...will
be
the
God
of
the
new
world
!
I
was
right,
humans
are...
interesting
!
To
be
continued...
I
had
a
dream
that
no
one
else
could
have
and
I
threw
away
everything
that
I
didn't
need
Thoughts
that
I
can't
surrender
dwel
in
my
chest
Even
if
I'm
still
in
the
rift
between
reality
and
ideals
and
my
feet
are
bound
by
shacles
of
sacrifice
My
overflowing
impulses
aren't
fully
repressed
Because
I
have
a
heart
that
yearns
powerfully
"Lies"
"Fear"
"Facade"
"Grief"
I
won't
be
weak
enough
To
be
apprehended
by
the
various
negative
things
I'm
a
trickster
who
doesn't
know
loneliness
