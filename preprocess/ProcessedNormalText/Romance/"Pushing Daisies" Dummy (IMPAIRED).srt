WHO
ARE
YOU?
YOU
WERE
MY
FIRST
KISS.
YOU
WERE
MY
FIRST
KISS,TOO.
YOU
TOUCH
MURDER
VICTIMS,
YOU
ASK
WHO
KILLED
THEM.
YOU
TOUCH
THEM
AGAIN,
THEY
GO
BACK
TO
BEING
DEAD,
AND
YOU
COLLECT
THE
REWARD?
THAT'S
IT
IN
A
NUTSHELL.

ARE
YOU
THE
BUSINESS
PARTNER?
DOESN'T
SHE
LOOK
A
LOT
LIKE
THAT
DEAD
GIRL?
SHE
LOOKS
EXACTLY
LIKE
THAT
DEAD
GIRL.
DO
YOU...TOUCH
ANYTHING?
I
T-TOUCH
LOTS
OF
THINGS.
DOES
HE
TOUCH
YOU?
I'D
KISS
YOU
IF
IT
WOULDN'T
KILL
ME.
Emerson:
ARE
YOU
IN
LOVE
WITH
HER?
IT'S
THAT
LEVEL
OF
STUPID.
I
KIND
OF
KILLED
HER
DAD
WHEN
I
WAS
10.
SHE
DOESN'T
KNOW.
I
JUST
THOUGHT
MY
WORLD
WOULD
BE
A
BETTER
PLACE
IF
YOU
WERE
IN
IT.
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
ELSE
I
SHOULD
KNOW?
NO.

STOOD

THE
EXACT
SPOT
WHERE,
4
WEEKS
AND
2
DAYS
PREVIOUSLY,
HIS
FATHER
HAD
DEPOSITED
HIM
AT
THE
LONGBURROW
SCHOOL
FOR
BOYS.
AS
YOUNG
NED'S
MOTHER
HAD
DIED
RECENTLY,
THERE
WAS
REASSURING
PHYSICAL
CONTACT
AND
PARTING
WORDS.
"I'LL
BE
BACK."
HE
LIED.
THE
SADNESS
AND
DREAD
WHICH
THE
BOY
FELT
WERE
NOT
SO
MUCH
A
PRODUCT
OF
THE
LONGBURROW
SCHOOL.
YOUNG
NED'S
ACUTE
DISCOMFORT
CAME
FROM
THE
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
WHEN
HE
TOUCHED
A
DEAD
THING,IT
CAME
BACK
TO
LIFE.
THE
OTHER
BOYS
ASSUMED
HIS
INTROVERTED
NATURE
WAS
A
PRODUCT
OF
WEAKNESS
AND
CODDLING.
THINKING
OF
REVENGE
AND
ALSO
NOT
THINKING
AT
ALL,
YOUNG
NED
VOLUNTEERED
TO
ASSIST
WITH
THAT
DAY'S
SCIENCE

IN
PLACE
OF
GREAT
JOY.
HE
VOWED
TO
KEEP
THE
STRANGE
DETAILS

HIS
STRANGE

SECRET

FOREVER.
ARE
YOU
RESPONSIBLE
FOR

28
YEARS,24
WEEKS,3
DAYS,
11

WAS
MURDERED.
IS
THIS
STRANGE?
THIS
IS
NOT
STRANGE.UNUSUAL,
MAYBE
ECCENTRIC,
IN
A
QUAINT
WAY,
LIKE
DESSERT
SPOONS.
Narrator:
REVIVED
BY
THE
PIE
MAKER
AND
GIVEN
A
SECOND
CHANCE
AT
LIFE,
SHE
HAD
MANY
QUESTIONS.
I
HAVE
SO
MANY
QUESTIONS,
MY
MIND
WANDERS.
YOU
NEED
TO
FEED
IT
WARM
MILK
AND
A
TURKEY
SANDWICH.
LET
IT
CURL
UP
IN
A
SUNNY
SPOT
AND
TAKE
A
NAP.
I
MISS
MY
AUNTS.
OF
COURSE.
DO
YOU
MISS
THEM
A
LOT?
A
LITTLE.
ALL
THE
TIME?
NOW
AND
THEN.
Narrator:
AS
CHUCK
SPOKE,SHE
REALIZED
HER
SECRETS
WERE
"REALLY
A
LOT"
AND
"EVERY
MINUTE,"
IN
THAT
ORDER.
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
HAVE
YOU
TOUCHED?
PEOPLE
OR
ANIMALS?
CROSSING.
DIGBY
DOESN'T
COUNT.
DIGBY
DOES
COUNT.
NO
ONE'S
BEEN
THROUGH
AS
MUCH
WITH
ME
AS
DIGBY.
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
HAVE
YOU
BROUGHT
BACK
TO
LIFE?
IT'S
NOT
LIKE
I
WALK
AROUND
REVIVING
CHILDHOOD
SWEETHEARTS
WILLY-NILLY.
WELL,WHAT
ABOUT
EMERSON,HUH?
OH,COMING
THROUGH!
YOU
TOUCHED
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
WITH
EMERSON.
FOR
WORK.
JUST
BECAUSE
YOU
KILL
THEM
AGAIN
AS
SOON
AS
YOU
GET
WHAT
YOU
WANT
DOESN'T
MAKE
IT
ANY
DIFFERENT.
YES,IT
DOES.
COMING
THROUGH.
AND
CAN
WE
NOT
SAY
"KILL"?
I
TOUCH
THEM
AGAIN
IS
ALL,
AND
THEY
SNAP
RIGHT
BACK
TO
THE
WAY
THEY'RE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE.
AM
I
THE
RUBBER
BAND
THAT
BROKE?
CHUCK,YOU'RE
THE
ONLY
HUMAN
BEING
I'VE
EVER
MADE
ALIVE
AGAIN
TO
STAY.
Narrator:
HE
LIED.
IN

HAD
KEPT
ONE

A
MINUTE.
USING
THE
GIFT
TO
TEMPORARILY
REVIVE
HIS
OWN
MOTHER,
THE
UNINTENDED
EFFECT
ON
CHUCK'S
FATHER
HAD
BEEN
MORE
PERMANENT.
THPIE
MAKER
OFTEN
ASKED
HIMSELF
IF
HE
WOULD
EVER
BE
ABLE
TO
TELL
CHUCK
THIS
SECRET.
YOUR
EYE'S
TWITCHING.
IS
IT?
THIS
IS
SUCH
A
SMALL
CHEESE
BOX.
Narrator:
THE
AUNTS
WHO
HAD
RAISED
CHUCK
HAD
TAUGHT
HER
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
LARGE
WHITE
APPLIANCE
IN
THE
KITCHEN
HAD
A
FAIRLY
NARROW
PURPOSE.
AUNT
LILY,IS
IT
OKAY
TO
FREEZE
THE
CAMEMBERT?
I'D
RATHER
NOT
WEDGE
IT
BETWEEN
THE
EDAM
AND
THE
PANEER!
OR
I
COULD
AIR
OUT
THE
GOUDA!
Narrator:
IN
FACT,YOUNG
CHUCK
DID
NOT
REFER
TO
A
REFRIGERATOR
AS
ANYTHING
BUT
A
CHEESE
B
UNTIL
SHE
WAS
17.
AS
CHUCK
CONSIDERED
THE
LIFE
SHE
COULD
NEVER
GO
BACK
TO,
OLIVE
SNOOK
CONSIDERED
THE
CHANGES
IN
HER
OWN
LIFE
--
FOREMOST,THE
MYSTERIOUS
BRUNETTE
ENCROACHING
ON
THE
MAN
SHE
HERSELF
LOVED.
FROM
HER
PERCH,THE
JEALOUS
YET
AGILE
NEIGHBOR
WAS
ABLE
TO
CONFIRM
ONLY
ONE
PLEASING
DETAIL.
THERE'S
A
SURPRISING
LACK
OF
PHYSICAL
CONTACT.
OH,CRAP.
Narrator:
ONE
MILE
TO
THE
WEST,
EMERSON
COD
WAS
ALSO
NOT
THRILLED.
DURING
TIMES
OF
STRESS
OR
ANXIETY,HE
LIKED
TO
KNIT.
SINCE
THE
ARRIVAL
OF
THE
DEAD
GIRL
WHO
WAS
NOT
DEAD,
HE
FOUND
THE
STOCKINETTE
STITCH
TO
BE
ESPECIALLY
RELAXING.
EMERSON
COD.
Narrator:
BUT
NO
STITCH
WAS
A
SUBSTITUTE
FOR
A
GOOD
MURDER
CASE.
THANKS.
GOT
IT.
MEET
ME
AT
THE
MORGUE
IN
15
MINUTES.
Narrator:
AS
HE
FINISHED
PEARLING
THE
ROW,
HE
WISHED
ALOUD...
SHE
BETTER
NOT
COME.
HI,EMERSON.
ISN'T
THIS
EXCITING?
HEY!
WHAT'S
SHE
DOING
HERE?
SAID
SHE
DIDN'T
CLIMB
OUT
OF
A
COFFIN
FOR
ME
TO
KEEP
HER
IN
A
BOX.
SHE
THE
BOSS
OF
YOU?
I'M
THE
BOSS
OF
ME.
DEAD
GIRL'S
GOT
TO
GO.
DEAD
GIRL'S
NOT
GOING
ANYWHERE.
YOU
DON'T
KNOW
NOTHING
ABOUT
HER
EXCEPT
SHE
HAD
SOFT
LIPS
WHEN
SHE
WAS
10.
THAT
SHOULD
BE
ENOUGH.
WELL,I
DON'T
LIKE
IT.

HEY!
WHAT
DID
YOU
GUYS
TALK
ABOUT?
I'D
REALLY
LIKE
TO
GET
OUT
OF
THIS
CAR
SOON.
IS
HE
UPSET
YOU
BROUGHT
YOUR
CHILDHOOD
SWEETHEART
BACK
TO
LIFE?
HE
BARELY
KNOWS
YOU'RE
HERE.
Narrator:
IN
FACT,EMERSON
COD
HAD
FINISHED
KNITTING
A
SWEATER
VEST
AND
TWO
HANDGUN
COZIES
IN
THE
WEEK
SINCE
CHUCK'S
RETURN.
SWEET.
DO
I
REALLY
HAVE
TO
SIT
IN
BACK
FROM
NOW
ON?
IT'S
FOR
YOUR
OWN
SAFETY.
YOU
SOUND
LIKE
MY
DAD.
IF
MY
HAND
BRUSHES
YOURS,
YOU'D
BE
DEAD.
HE
DIDN'T
SAY
THAT.
SO
IT'S
PROBABLY
BETTER
IF
YOU
STAY
IN
THE
CAR
FOR
THESE
MORGUE
VISITS.
SOMEONE
MIGHT
RECOGNIZE
YOU.
YOU
REALLY
CAN'T
COME
IN.
DID
I
SAY
"CAN"?BECAUSE
I
SWALLOW
MY
CONSONANTS
SOMETIMES.
"N'T.
N'T."CAN'T
COME
IN.

GOT

HIT-AND-RUN?
WE'RE

...THE
APPARENT
VICTIM
OF
A
HIT-AND-RUN
DRIVER.
Narrator:
AS
THERE
WERE
NO
WITNESSES,
THE
POLICE
ARE
OFFERING
A
REWARD
FOR

LEADING
TO
THE

KILLER.
I'M
GONNA
WAIT
BACK
HERE.
YOU
DON'T
LIKE
DEAD
BODIES,
DO
YOU?
NOT
WHEN
THEY
SIT
UP
AND
TALK.
POOR
MAN.
JUSTOUCH
IT.
I'M
STARTING
THE
WATCH.
HEY.
HEY.
WHY
IS
EVERYTHING
SO
BLURRY?
PROBABLY
BECAUSE
YOUR
EYEBALLS
ARE
FLAT.
ASK
THE
QUESTION.
MR.
SLAYBECK,DO
YOU
--
DO
YOU
HAVE
ANY
LAST
REQUESTS,
UNFINISHED
BUSINESS
FROM
THIS
LIFE
WE
CAN
HELP
YOU
WITH?
DON'T
LET
HER
DO
THIS.
IS
THIS
HEAVEN?
COULD
BE.
NO,IT'S
NOT.
IS
THAT
GOD?
NO,IT'S
NOT.
I'M
CONFUSED,
BECAUSE
I'M
A
BUDDHIST.
BUDDHISM
IS
FASCINATING,
ISN'T
IT?
DID
IT
HELP
YOU
IN
YOUR
FINAL
MOMENTS?
SHE'S
WASTING
MY
MINUTE.
WHAT'S
WITH
THIS
MINUTE?
AND
WHEN
DID
IT
BECOME
YOUR
MINUTE?
SURE
THE
HELL
AIN'T
YOURS.
HEY,IT'S
EVERYONE'S
MINUTE,
OR,UH,22
SECONDS.
CAN
YOU
GET
A
MESSAGE
TO
EARTH?
CAN
YOU
TELL
JEANINE
IN
PROMOTIONS
THAT
I
LOVED
HER?
OF
COURSE.
MR.
SLAYBECK,IF
YOU
COULD
REMEMBER
ANYTHING
ABOUT
WHOEVER
WAS
DRIVING
THE
HIT-AND-RUN
VEHICLE
THAT
KILLED
YOU,
I
THINK
WE
CAN
GET
YOU
SOME
JUSTICE.
WHAT
HIT-AND-RUN?
I
WAS
KILLED
BY
A
CRASH-TEST
DUMMY.
I'M
NOT

I'D
BE
AN
ANGRY
GOD.
OH,WE
GAVE
IT
OUR
BEST
SHOT.
SO,A
CRASH-TEST
DUMMY
KILLED
BERNARD.
BERNARD
WAS
DELUSIONAL.
IT'S
STILL
A
CLUE.
IT'S
A
DEAD
END.
AND
NOT
THE
KIND
OF
DEAD

YOU
CAN
UNDEAD
AND
THEN
REDEAD
AGAIN,
LIKE

IT'S
MY
FAULT?
WHEN
YOU
GET
ALL
JABBERWOCKY
IN
MY

IT'S
HARD
TO
FOLLOW
UP
ON
"THE
DUMMY
DID

NOW.
ISN'T
THAT
WHAT
A
P.I.'s
SUPPOSED
TO
DO?
INVESTIGATE?
ISN'T
THAT
THE

PART?
THE
FUN
PART'S

AN
EQUALLY
CHILLING
SIGHT
OF
HER
OWN.
ONE
OF
THESE
DUMMIES
IS
NOT
LIKE
THE
OTHERS.
WHERE
DID
HIS
CLOTHES
GO?
WHERE
DID
HIS
FACE
GO?
MAYBE
BERNARD
WASN'T
CRAZY.
THE
DUMMY
DID
IT.
OR
AT
LEAST
SOMEONE
IN
DUMMY
MASK
AND
AN
ORANGE
JUMPSUIT.
CHUCK
FOUND
THE
CLUE.
I
FOUND
THE
CLUE.
"CLUE"
IS
A
BOARD
GAME.
THE
PROFESSOR
DID
IT
IN
THE
PARLOR
WITH
A
RUBBER
MALLET.
THAT'S
A
CLUE.
WE
FIND
EVIDENCE.
YOU
GOT
TO
ADMIT,THIS
MEANS
SOMETHING.
IT
COULD
BE
A
LEAD.
WHO
WOULD
HAVE
ACCESS?
LOOPY
DANDY
LION
MODELS,ANGRY
TECHNICIANS
--
COULD
BE
ANYBODY.
I
DID
SOME
CHECKING
ON
THAT
CAR
COMPANY.
THEY
GOT
A
LOT
RIDING
ON
THIS
DANDY
LION.
LOOF
ANGRY
COMPETITORS,TOO.
WE
GOT
TO
GET
BACK
IN
THERE
TONIGHT.
OH,THAT'S
NOT
HOW
WE
DO
IT.
WE
GOT
TO
GET
BACK
IN
THERE
TONIGHT,
SEE
IF
WHOEVER
TOOK
THAT
DUMMY
MASK
LEFT
ANY
EVIDENCE.
OLIVE?
HIYA!
WE'RE
GOING
OUT
LATE
TONIGHT,A
PRIVILEGE
THING,
HARDLY

EXPLAINING.
CAN

ENTERING
WITH
NO

CONTACTED
THE
COMPANY
THAT
MAKES
THESE

GAVE

A

I.D.
BADGE,
WHICH
I
DIGITALLY
ALTERED
USING

MATCHES
THE

IS

GAVE

MY

DISTRACTED
HIM

CALL

Narrator:
AT
THAT
MOMENT,
THE
PIE
MAKER
FELT
A
MIXTURE
OF
HAPPINESS
AND
TREPIDATION.
WHY
IS
IT
ALWAYS
A
MIXTURE?
WHAT
DO
YOU
KNOW
ABOUT
EMERSON

IS
SO
GREAT
ABOUT
KNOWING?
WHEN
YOU
LIFT

NO,YOU
FIND
WORMS.
I
SAY
NO

KNOWING.
WE
HAVEN'T
SEEN
EACH
OTHER

20
YEARS.
DON'T
YOU
WANT
TO
KNOW
ABOUT

I
WANT
TO
KNOW
EVERYTHING
ABOUT
YOU.
LOOK,WE'VE
ALL
DONE
THINGS
WE'RE
NOT
PROUD
OF.
WE
ALL
HAVE
SECRETS.
WHAT
SECRETS?
SKELETONS
IN
THE
CLOSET.
EXACTLY.
HOW
LG
HAVE
YOU
BEEN
LISTENING?
THERE
ARE
SKELETONS
IN
THE

THOSE

YOU

WHAT'S
HAPPENING
RIGHT

UH,LAST
THING
I
REMEMBER,
I
WAS

GEEZ,THOSE
THINGS
ARE
DULL.
YOU
EVER
HEARD
OF
THE
DANDY
LION

NOPE.
YOU
WANT
TO
OPEN
THE
KIMONO
ON
WHY
I'M
WEARING
A
SILVER
LEOTARD
AND
HANGING
FROM
A
HOOK?

YOU
HAVE
ANY
LAST
REQUESTS
OR
THOUGHTS?
IF
I
WANTED
TO
MINGLE
WITH
A
BUNCH

GEEKS
WEARING
LEOTARDS,
I'D
HAVE
STAYED
IN
ART
SCHOOL.
YOU
WENT
TO
ART
SCHOOL?
DIDN'T
KNOW
THAT,DID
YOU?
STOP
IT!
I
WAS
JUST
RIDING
THE
FERRIS
WHEEL
AT
THE
STATE
FAIR,
AND
THE
TEENAGER
RUNNING
IT
SAID
I
COULD
RIDE
AN
EXTRA...TURN.
DID
YOU
EVER
HEAR
OF
THE
DANDY
LION
CAR
COMPANY?
NO.
MOVING
ON.
WAIT
A
SEC.
I
DID
CHECK
A
BOX
THAT
SAID
I
COULD
BE
USED
TO
TEST
AUTOMOBILE
SAFETY.
SOUNDS
SCARY,BUT
WHEN
YOU'RE
DEAD,YOU'RE
DEAD.
AM
I
DEAD?
THERE'S
NOTHING
ILLEGAL
ABOUT
ANY
OF
THAT?
AND
WHY
WOULD
DANDY

REPLACE
ALL
THEIR
CRASH-TEST
DUMMIES
WITH
DEAD
BODIES?
AND
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
ALL
THE
REAL
DUMMIES?
Narrator:
BEFORE

SLIGHTLY
INSULTING

Shh,Shh.
SEE
THAT?
JEANINE?
what?
I
COULDN'T
TELL
YOU
ANYTHING
BEFORE
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
WATCHING
ME.
I
HID
AT
WORK
TO
MAKE
SURE
NO
ONE
WOULD
FOLLOW
ME
HOME.
THE
TRUTH
IS
BERNIE
AND
I
WERE
SO
IN
LOVE.
IT
ALL
STARTED
WHEN
HE
CAME
TO
SEE
THIS
SALES
TRAINING
THING
ON
HIS
LONG
LUNCH
BREAK,AND
IT
WAS
LOVE
AT
FIRST
SIGHT.
I
COULDN'T
TAKE
MY
EYES
OFF
HIM.
HE
JUST
MESMERIZED
ME.
MY
HEART
LEAPT
OUT
OF
MY
CHEST,AND
I
JUST
COULDN'T
LOOK
AWAY.
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHAT
IT
WAS.
I
GOT
ALL
MISTY-EYED,YOU
KNOW?
Narrator:
AND
AS
JEANINE
CONTINUED
TO
EAT
HER
TRIPLE-BER
PIE,
SHE
TOLD
THEM
THE
STORY
OF
HER
LOVE
AFFAIR
WITH
BERNARD
SLAYBECK.
PRESENT,PRESENT,PRESENT,PRESENT,PRESENT,PRESENT,
AND
GIGGLE,GIGGLE,GIGGLE,GIGGLE,GOOD
GIRLS.
Narrator:
THEY
HAD
MET
WHEN
THE
SCIENTIST
HAD
COME
TO
WATCH
SALES
TRAINING
ON
A
LONG
LUNCH.
THE
ATTRACTION
WAS
INSTANTANEOUS,
AND
THEY
WOULD
BOTH
CONFESS
TO
REPLAYING
THIS
FIRST
ENCOUNTER
AS
THEY
FELL
ASLEEP
IN
THEIR
BEDS
THAT
NIGHT.
HE
WOULD
REMEMBER
HER
HAIR
AS
BEING
SLIGHTLY
REDDER,
HER
SWEATER
SLIGHTLY
TIGHTER,
BUT
THE
SMILE
HE
WOULD
GET
JUST
RIGHT.
SHE
WOULD
REMEMBER
HIS
LOOK
AS
SHY
BUT
FLIRTATIOUS,
HIS
TIE
AS
RED
BUT
VERY
THIN,
AND
THAT
HIS
SANDWICH
WAS
AN
ANGUS
BEEF
PATTY
WITH
BUTTERHEAD
LETTUCE,ROMA
TOMATOES,
ON
A
SESAME-SEED
WHOLE-WHEAT
BUN,
AND
A
GLASS
OF
2%
MILK.
AS
THEY
TALKED,THESE
ARE
THE
THINGS
SHE
CAME
TO
KNOW
FIRST.
THE
SCIENTIST
WAS
KIND.
THE
SCIENTIST
WAS
LONELY.
THE
SCIENTIST
CAME
ALIVE
WHEN
HE
TOLD
HER
ABOUT
HIS
HOBBY
OF
CATCHING
BUTTERFLIES.
WHEN
HE
ADMITTED
THAT
HE
ALWAYS
SET
THEM
FREE,
SHE
FELT
DIZZY
AND
GIGGLED
FOR
NO
REASON.
Narrator:
THE
WAIF
AND
THE
SCIENTIST
FELL
DEEPLY
IN
LOVE,
HIDING
THEIR
AFFAIR
FROM
THE
WORLD
LIKE
A
TRADE
SECRET.
BUT
JEANINE
FROM
PROMOTIONS
FELT
A
CHASM
GROWING
BETWEEN
THEM.
AS
THE
LAUNCH
OF
THE
FLOWER
CAR
GREW
CLOSER,
BERNARD'S
HOURS
GREW
LONGER.
HE
BECAME
DISTANT
AND
HARD
TO
REACH.
SUSPECTING
HER
SAFETY
SCIENTIST
OF
STEPPING
OUT
ON
HER,
SHE
BEGAN
TO
SPY.
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
OTHER
FLOWER,
ONLY
MYSTERIOUS
TRIPS
INTO
THE
DARKNESS.
WHERE
DID
SHE
GO?
SORRY.
RESTROOM.
MINT,ANYONE?
NO,THANKS.
WHERE
WAS
SLAYBECK
GOING
ON
THESE
NIGHT
DRIVES?
I
COULD
NEVER
SEE.
AND
WHEN
I
CONFRONTED
HIM
ABOUT
IT,
HE
WOULDN'T
TELL
ME
ANYTHING.
I
THOUGHT
I
WAS
BEING
PARANOID
TILL
HTURNED
UP
DEAD.
YOU
GONNA
FINISH
THAT?
YES.
I
WISH
WE
KNEW
WHAT
HE
WAS
DOING.
OH,I
FIGURED
IT
OUT.

IT'S
EASIER
IF
I
SHOW
YOU.
FOLLOW
ME.
SHOTGUN!
CHUCK!
I
HATE
THE
BACK.
DEAD,AGAIN,FOREVER.
FINE.
Chuck:
SHE'S
NOT
GOING
VERY
FAST.
Ned:
THAT
CAR
CAN'T
HAVE
A
VERY
BIG
ENGINE.
MAYBE
SHE
ATE
IT.
THAT'S
NOT
FUNNY.
SHE
OBVIOUSLY
HAS
A
VERY
SERIOUS
DISORDER.
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN?
SERIOUSLY?
THE
GIRL'S
GOT
A
WHOLE
SECRET
LIFE
IN
THE
BATHROOM.
AND
I
KNOW
EXACTLY
HOW
SHE
FEELS.
SO
DO
I.
I
HATE
HAVING
SECRETS.
NOW

AM

ALL
THESE
DISGUISES,HIDING

YOUR

I
HATE

LITTLE
HALF-SECRET,HALF-HUMAN

MISS
MY

THEN
ALL
I
HAVE
IS
YOU.
WHICH
IS
GREAT,BUT...
I
DON'T
KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
YOU
SINCYOU
WERE
9.
IT'S
PRETTY
MUCH
I
BAKE
PIES
AND
WAKE
THE
DEAD.
I
LIVE
A
VERY
SHELTERED
LIFE.
I
ALREADY
LIVED
A
SHELTERED
LIFE
ONCE.
BUT
IT
WASN'T
AS
SHELTERED

AUNT

EXTENSIVE

HIDDEN

THE

CELLAR.
THE
CHEESE
FLOOR,THE
SPOOKY
PLACE

I
WILL
PAY
BOTH
OF
YOU
NOT

HAVE
THIS
CONVERSATION
IN
FRONT
OF

IT'S
NOT

YOU
CAN'T

TRAGICALLY

SAT.

GOOD

LOOK
OKAY?
RUNWAY
READY.
REALLY?

ALWAYS
THIS
SWEET?

LOOK,SOME
CAR
BOMBER

WENT

A
LOT
OF
TROUBLE

KEEP
YOU
FROM
SHOWING
US
WHATEVER
IT
IS
YOU
WANTED
TO
SHOW
US.
THE
BODIES.
WHAT
BODIES?
THE
DEAD
BODIES?
WE
ALREADY
FOUND
THE
DEAD
BODIES.
NO.
THE
ONES
IN
THE
BIG
HOLE.
HOW
SAD.
WHY
WOULD
SOMEBODY
DO
THIS?
ONE
WAY
TO
FIND
OUT.
WHAT
IS
ALL
THAT?
EACH
ONE
OF
THESE
GUYS
IS
FITTED
WITH
A
COMPUTER
HARD
DRIVE
TO
RECORD
ANY
OF
THE
CRASH-TEST
DATA.
YOU
BURY
THE
DUMMIES,YOU
BURY
THE
DATA.
COULDN'T
THEY
JUST
ERASE
IT?
YOU
NEVER
CAN
COMPLETELY
ERASE
ANYTHING.
WHY
ARE
DEAD
PEOPLE
ON
HOOKS
AND
PLASTIC
DUMMIES
IN
A
GRAVE?
THE
COMPANY
MUST
HAVE
SWITCHED
TO
CADAVERS
SO
THAT
THERE'D
BE
NO
PERMANENT
RECORD
OF
THE
CRASH-TEST
RESULTS,
'CAUSE
DEAD
PEOPLE
DON'T
TALK...
USUALLY.
Narrator:
AS

PIE
MAKER'S
BRAIN
CRACKLED
WITH
10,000
VOLTS
OF
ELECTRICITY
AND
THEN
LOST
CONSCIOUSNESS,
OLIVE
WOULD
HAVE
NO
SUCH
LUCK.
DIGBY,YOU
AWAKE?
I
CAN'T
SLEEP,EITHER.
Narrator:
CLOSING
HER
EYES

VISIONS

LATE-NIGHT
DATE

THE
PERKY
BRUNETTE
FROM
NOWHERE
MORE
VIVID
AND
UNCENSORED.
OH!
YUCK.

THE
FACTS
WERE
THESE.
THROUGH
A
SERIES
OF
CRASH-TEST
EXPEMENTS,
BERNARD
SLAYBE
HAD
LEARNED
THAT
THE
DANDY
LION
WAS
A
DEADLY
DUD.
BERNARD
BEGGED
THE
PRESIDENT
TO
CANCEL
THE
CAR'S
LAUNCH,
BUT
MARK
CHASE
HAD
OTHER
PLANS.
LIKE
A
SMOKING
GUN,THE
SMOKING
DUMMIES
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
BURIED.
THE
COMPANY
HAD
INVESTED
MILLIONS
IN
THE
DANDY
LION,
AND
HE
KNEW
THAT
KEEPING
THIS
TERRIBLE
SECRET
WOULD
STILL
BE
CHEAPER
THAN
HALTING
PRODUCTION
OF
THE
CAR.
A
DECISION
WAS
MADE,A
COVER-UP
UNDERTAKEN.
IF
THE
DUMMIES
HAD
TO
GO,
SO
WOULD
ANY
DUMMY
WHO
GOT
IN
THE
WAY.
AS
HE
REGAINED
CONSCIOUSNESS
AND
HURTLED
TOWARD
THE
CRASH-TEST
WALL,
BERNARD'S
ONLY
THOUGHTS
WERE
OF
JEANINE
AND
HOW
HE
WISHED
HE'D
TOLD
HER
HE
LOVED
HER.
MARK
CHASE'S
ATTENTION
TO
DETAIL
AND
GIFT
FOR
PLANNING
HAD
SERVED
HIM
WELL
AS
A
C.E.O.,AND
NOW
AGAIN
AS
A
MURDERER.
HIS
COVER-UP
COMPLETE,
HIS
ONLY
THOUGHTS
WERE
THAT
THE
DANDY
LION
SX
WOULD
BLOOM
ON
TIME
AND
NO
ONE
WOULD
STOP
HIM.
THE
DANDY
LION
CAR
IS
THE
CULMINATION
OF
MY
LIFE'S
WORK.
IT
IS
A
FLOWER-POWERED
PHENOMENON
BORNE
OF
A
THOUSAND
SLEEPLESS
NIGHTS,
INTENSE
RITALIN
ABUSE,
AND
A
LONG-SUBLIMATED
INTEREST
IN
BOTANY.
SO
WHAT
IF
IN

UNLIKELY
BUT
NOT

EVENT
THAT
THE
CAR
GETS
UP
TO
A
SPEED
OF
70
MILES
