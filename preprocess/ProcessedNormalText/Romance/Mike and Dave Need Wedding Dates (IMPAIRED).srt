RANDY:
Look,
Mike,
I

you.
But
no
one's
looking
They've
got
the
three...
What
is
it?
The
Cuervo,
the
other
one,
And
they
don't
need
more
tequila.
-
If
I
can't
sell
it,
it's
not
gonna
sell.
-
The
"new-new"?
They
want
that
new-new.
No!
What
if
I
could
sell
this
tequila
-
Would
I
have
your
order
then?
And
I'm
just
gonna
pick
a
customer
Excuse
me,
sir.
Do
you
enjoy
the
taste
of
tequila?

Why,
yes,
I
do.
But
I
only
drink
my
particular
brand,
-
It's
a
perfect
candidate.
I
know
that's
your
brother.
He
dated
my
niece.
Look,
mate,
I
don't
know
your
niece.
-
Okay.
I'd
say
she
was
a
little
clingy,
We

Friends

Dave,

His
name's
Rick.
I
know
he's
your
brother.
Look,

this
every
couple
weeks...
All
right,
I'll
take
10
cases.
-
Fuck,
yes!
Yes!
I
knew
it!
-
We
sold
your
ass,
Randy!
I
don't
know
if
that's
what
happened.
-
It
was
the
hat,
right?
I
just
found
this
over
there.

MIKE:
No,
dude.
I
loved
it,
Do
you
realize
that
that
sale
puts
us
The
Stangle
bros
are
killing
it
right
now!

MIKE:
It's
not
an
actual
hat.
If
you
wear
two,
they
break.
-
It's
an
urban
legend...
Mom,
Dad?
DAVE:
Jeanie.
Eric.
Don't
freak
out.
Just
come
on
in.
BURT:
Why
don't
we
all
just
sit
down?
We
gotta
talk
to
you.
We
wanna
discuss
-
DAVE:
Oh!
Sweet.
DAVE:
Are
you
guys
thinking
DJ
or
band?
No.
People
want
to
hear
the
real
songs.
You
don't
want
to
hear
a
guy
You
just
want
to
hear
Beyoncé.
Oh.
Yeah,
but
we
want
to
talk
about...
is
you
two.
Now,
over
the
years...
a
theme
has
emerged
Everyone's
having
a
good
time...
-
That's
right.
Party
time.
And
then
you
two
show
up...
stag...
and
you
hit
on
girls...
you
act
like
idiots...
and
you
ruin
it.
Ruin
it.
-
What?
We
are
not
party
ruiners!
We're
party
creators!
And
besides,
when
have
we
ever
Ah!
We
thought
you
might
say
that.
ROSIE:
BURT:
Apple
TV.
We
just
need
your
password.

Bryan's
baby
dick

BURT:
Bryan's
baby
dick
69.
What
the
fuck,
guys?
Really?
-
Got
it.
Yep.
BURT:
Good.
Happy
Fourth
of
July!

Oh,
shit!

It
was
fun
up
to
that
point.
-


God
damn
it!
My
trailer!



Oh,
shit.
Actually,
this
is
what
-

-
The
both
of
you
are
fucking
idiots.


JEANIE:
Grandpa,
wake
up!
Take
his
tie.
Are
you
saying
we
had
something
to
do
He
died
five
years
after
that!
That
is
a
lot
of
guilt
to
put
us.
Plus,
this
video
only
shows
the
screw-ups.
Where's
the
epic
tracking
And
everybody
looking
at
us,
just
going...
"God,
I
love
Mike
and
Dave.
"They
made
this
whole
party
worth
it."
When
are
the
two
of
you
going
to
grow
up?
This
shtick
was
cute
for
a
while...
but
it's
gotten
stale.
Mom,
come
on,
what
are
you...
You're
talking
about
us
like
BURT:
What
we
don't
want
you
to
do
is
-
You
understand?
-
You
can
each
talk
to
one
girl.
-
What
do
you
mean?
-
That's
two
dates.
-
Excuse
me?
Nice,
respectable,
smart
girls!
-
What
the
fuck?
-
Are
you
insane?
You
are
not
screwing
up
this
wedding.
Mom,
do
you
hear
this
river
of
horse
shit
We
don't
want
you
showing
up
stag
-
We
don't
rile
each
other
up!
-
I
don't
get
riled!
Look
at
you
right
now!
You're
riled!
-
Take
your
head
out
of
your
ass,
Dad!
Everybody
stop
yelling!
Okay?
You
guys
bringing
wedding
dates
Look,
I
love
the
shit
out
of
you
guys.
But
everyone
is
already
stressed
out
and
I
just
need
you
to
be
cool.
Of
course,
Jeanie!
Please?
For
me?
I
promise.
We
would
never
do
anything
MIKE:
Jeanie,
we
love
you.
We
want
this
to
be
Yeah.
You,
too,
Eric.
-
Oh.
Mostly
you,
though,
Jeanie.

If
you
want
us
to
bring
dates,
All
right,
it's
settled
then.
Wedding
dates!
Dave,
buddy,
let
me
talk
to
you
I'm
sorry
to
lump
you
in
with
Mike...
but
if
I
only
told
your
older
brother
he'd
get
all
weird
about
it.
I
just
feel
like
he's
holding
you
back.
Dad,
I
don't
mind
Do
you
remember
when
Mom
made
those
cupcakes...
and
I
called
them
moist?
-
Mm-hmm.
till
Mike
took
a
cupcake...
and
shoved
it
in
Tom
Ginty's
face.
He
said,
"Now
you're
moist,
Moist."
That's
the
kind
of
guy
Mike
is.
So,
think
on
that...
Dad.
I'm
sorry,
I
didn't
mean
to
end
that
-
I
love
you.
And
thanks.
I'm
not
even
mad.
I'm
not
even
upset.
We're
gonna
find
some
dates.
TATIANA:
I
gotta
say,
some
nights,
But
tonight
is
not
one
of
those
nights!

-
Do
you
like
my
hair?
-
You
look
good.
We're
gonna
make
a
lot
of
tips
tonight.
Good.
We
need
it.
We
don't
have
any
money.
Uh,
you
got
money
for
this
ride,
don't
you?
-
Oh,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah!

'Cause
you
have
money?
I
thought
you
had
money.
I
don't
have
any
money.
You
know
I
don't
have
money.
Yeah,
y'all
are
whispering
like
people
Check
it
out.
I'mma

you
right
now.
Boop.
I
Apple
Paid.
I
don't
even
have
Apple
Pay.
Yo,
Siri,

this
man.
He's
already
paid.
God
damn
it!
I'm
not
gonna
take
shit
from
you,
You
shouldn't
take
shit
from
us.
-
You
should
kick
us
out!
You
know
what?
I'm
gonna
kick
you
Yeah,
just
go
three
more
blocks
up
and
then
kick
us
out!
-

Get
out
of
my
cab.
Thank
you.
You're
a
really
good
person.
Okay,
God
bless
you.
I'm
just
gonna
start
driving
for
Uber.
Ooh.
I
got
a
good
idea.
Let's
pop
off,
get
a
couple
of
drinks
Just
a
few,
Yeah,
of
course
not.
Just
a
light
buzz.

Hey,
hey,
hey!
Welcome
to
Sake
Bombers...
where
your
first
Sake
Bomb
is
on
us!
-
Kaboom!
You're
doing
that
thing
but
you're
really
yelling.
Because
I'm
upset
with
you.
Oh,
what
the
hell?
ALICE:
I
don't
understand
why
you
just
-
What
the
hell
is
going
on
here?
Straight
up.
She's
been
going
through
a
hard
time.
-
Are
you
guys
talking
about
me?
You
know
how
many
times
and
she
is
drunk
off
her
fucking
ass,
Only
when
Rihanna
comes
on,
I
am
a
strong
independent
woman.
And
I
will
get
on
a
table
Because
it's
my
right.
America!
Feminism!
You
just
push
your
tits
up
Yeah.
Read
a
Twitter.

RONNIE:

do
that!
Who
put
her
jam
on?
Queen
RiRi,
forever!
I'm
really
sorry
that
I
got
us
fired.
I'm
just
sort
of
surprised
-
but
I'm
still
really
sorry.
Alice,
you
do
not
apologize
You
didn't
do
one
thing
wrong.
-
Okay.
Right.
You're
right.
Alice,
why
are
you
watching
FATHER
MIKE
ON
VIDEO:

ALICE:
Because
it's
therapeutic.
FATHER
MIKE:

Oh,
man.
Fuck
you,
Luke.
Oh,
fuck
that
guy.
Fuck
him
right
in
his
dick.
No!
Because
now
I'm
picturing
his
dick
And
it
makes
me
want
to
protect
it.
Oh,
my
God,
girl!
Damn!
You're
better
than
this.
Come

We're

Or
gave

balloon
tits
and
we
won
Oh,
yeah,
they
were
so
nice.
I
know,
dude.
We
need

shit.
I'm
tired
of
living
like

Welcome
back.
I'm
here
with
Mike
and
Dave
Stangle...
who
posted
an
ad
on
Craigslist...
looking
for
dates
in
Oahu,
Hawaii.
Well,
the
ad
went
viral.
Mm-hmm.
WENDY:
It
racked
up
over
6,000
responses...
from
women
who
actually
wanted
to
go.
Yeah,
well,
who's
counting?
You
know,
I
guess
we
all
are.
Is
this
my
close-up?
WENDY:
You
guys,
come
on.
Craigslist?
MIKE:
Honestly,
this
is
about
to
go
with
us
to
Hawaii
And
I
just
want
to
reiterate...
we're
footing
the
bill
for
this
Free
trip
to
Hawaii?

I'm
awake!
-
WENDY:
Come
on.
Craigslist.
That's
where
you
go
You
know
what
else
you
can
find
Mm-hmm.
-
Love.
That's
right.
I
said
it.
-
Love.
He
has
a
kind
soul.
Yeah,
and
he's
also
super
hot.
Yeah,
he's
hot
as
fucking
balls.
But
just
to
repeat,
Like,
girls
that
our
mom
and
our
sister
Okay,
look,
dude,
we
are
going
to
Hawaii.
Let's
go
on
vacation.
But
it's
not
a
vacation.
It's
a
wedding.
Do
you
really
think
a
wedding's
Since
the
last
wedding
I
went
to
and
it
didn't
turn
out
very
well.
I
hear
you,
but
look...
this
shit
is
why
this
shit
Because
ever
since
Luke
left,
You
need
to
get
over
that,
And
this
our
shot,
man.
That
dude,
This
right
here
is
an
opportunity
and
you
know
we
are
entrepreneurs.
You
know
what?
Let's
make
these
guys
take
us
to
Hawaii!
You're
right!
Let's
do
it!
Let's
just
do
it!
-
Yes,
bitch.
-
We'll
be
right
back.
TATIANA:
We
gonna
go
to
Hawaii!
We
gonna
go
to
Hawaii!
Whoa!
Whoa!
-
Hold
up!
Those
boys
said
they
wanted
nice
girls.
Yeah,
I
guess
Fine,
well,
you
know
what
we're
gonna
do?
We're
gonna
look
respectable
as
fuck.
Like
nice
girls.
Ugh.

Dude,
it's
like
that
Jesus
rag!
Ow!
It's
part
of
me.
Tatiana,
your
underwear
Whoa!
Oh,
this
dress
is
my
bitch!
Dude,
we
have
met
37
insane
women.
We
can't
bring
any
of
these
girls.
Maybe
Dad'll
just
forget
about
Why
would
Dad
forget
about
an
old
tomato?
No,
his
ultimatum.
-
Old
tom...
Are
you
saying
"old
tomato"?
Ultima-tomb.
Like
a
tomb
or
a
crypt.
Ultimatum.
Well,
we
gotta
figure
something
out,

BOTH:
And
I
said
that
first,
so
actually,
ALICE:
So
what
time
are
we
meeting
them?
Technically,
no
time.
Yeah,
because
I
was
thinking
about
but
then
I
was
thinking,
um...
what
kind
of
floozy-ass
bimbo
Um...
Us.
Yeah,
but
we're
not
like
those
idiots.
Because
they're
all
like,
it's
like
the
guys
interviewing
the
girls.
Like,
it
immediately
would
put
us
We're
gonna
flip
the
script
-
Those
guys
would
be
lucky
to
have
us.
-
We
just
gotta
make
them
think
so.
But,
you
know,
because
I
always
try
to
start
small
and
I
make-up
stuff
Baby,
you
can
do
this.
Okay.
-
Um,
what
do
you
like
to
do?
Just
sweet
teas.
Sweet
teas
and
biscuits
on
blimps.
All
right,
straight
up,
I
was
doing
an
accent?
And
definitely
don't
bring
up
blimps.
Shit!
They're
leaving.
If
it
was
a
competition,
I
won
it.
All
right,
don't
worry.
It's
all
part
of
the
plan.
-
Is
it?
What
does
that
mean?
What
plan?
Whoa!
Ahh!
-
Oh,
fuck!
-

Tatiana!
Oh!
Holy
shit.
Babe.
Are
you
okay?
I'm
okay.
Yell,
"She
can't
breathe!"
She
can't
breathe!
She
can't
breathe!
Somebody
help
her!
Somebody
give
her
CPR!
-
She
can't
breathe!
-
Great!
Hey,
don't
worry.
I
took
a
class.
I
know
what
I'm
doing.
-
ALICE:
She
has
a
weak
heart!
-
Ma'am?
I'm
an
EMT.
I'm
like
a
doctor,
basically.
I'm
here
to
save
your
fucking
life,
okay?
-
She's
my
only
friend!
We
got
a
pulse!
Okay.
Don't
let
her
die!
Don't
you
fucking
let
her
die,
Mike!
Just
shut
the
fuck
up,
Dave!
Both
of
you,
shut
up!
Okay?
I'm
gonna
save
her
life!

Plug
the
nose.

MIKE:
Oh!
Are
you
okay?

I
am
now.
-
I
saved
her
life!
-
She's
okay?

Thank
you!
Thank
you!
-
OFFICER:
You're
under
arrest.
TATIANA:
It
happens
all
the
time.
That
was
a
vicious
hit.
It's
crazy.
-
Almost.
-
Let
me
help
you
with
that
ice.
Oh,
no.
Seems
like
it's
going
pretty
well
Dude,
I'm
fucking
crushing
it!
So
hard!
-

The
kids
in
my
class
I'm
a
school
teacher.
You're
a
school
teacher?

Wow.
Oop.
I
think
they
spelt
"frittata"
I
always
notice
words
and
spelling...
because
I'm
a
teacher...
and
that's
what
I
do.

That's...
So,
Alice,
um,
what
do
you
do?
Manage
a
hedge
fund.
You
manage
a
hedge
fund?
I
don't
even
know
what
a
hedge
fund
is.
Oh.
So
there's
a
regular
fund,
And
our
fund...
Uh,
we
hedge
it.
We
hedge
it
hard.
Oh,
wow.
I
get
in,
in
the
morning,
and
I'm
like...
"How's
the
hedging
coming?
And
it's
like,
too
big
to
fail.
Corporate
greed,
bailouts.
In
a
New
York
minute,
On
the
floor
of
the
NASDAQ
and
the
U.N.
And
then,
Fannie
Mae.
Bernie
Mac
and
D.L.
Hughley...

Alice,
you
want
some
water?

That's
so
smart.

a
particular
set
of
skills.
"Skills
I
have
acquired
"Skills
that
make
me
a
nightmare
Click.
That's
it.
That
was
amazing.
It
was
like
Dave
was
not
even
here...
and
I
was
just
standing
in
a
bar
Like,
"Hello,
Liam
Neeson's
over
here."
You're
a
professional
comedian
What?
No.
I
sell
liquor
with
my
brother.
-
Oh.
-
I
do
like
to
draw.
Yeah,
I
have
drawings
here
Oh,
shit,
not
that.
Sorry.
Here.
So,
they're
like
The
Avengers...
but
they're
different
types
of
alcohol.
So,
you
have
Tequila,
And
his
name
is
Lil'
Mez.
Because
he'll
"Mez"
you
up.
The
next
one
right
there,
that's
Gin.

When
he
flips
his
cap
off,
"Yo,
I'll
pop
you
off.
Guaranteed.
Done.
Next,
Whiskey.

and
kill
bad
guys.
Dude,
this
is
objectively
amazing.

Thanks.
What's
the
hardest
thing
I
don't
know.
Oh,
um...
The
hardest
thing
about
being
a
teacher...
is
teaching
cursive.
That's
awesome.
-
What
about
you?
-
Are
you
seeing
anyone?
My
ex
is
gone.
Long
gone.
What
do
you
mean?
He
died.
Of
cancer.
Oh,
my
God.
And
AIDS.
He
died
twice?

And
then
he
died
Whoo!
That's
a
lot
to
take
in.
I
know!
Thank
you.
Thank
you,
brotha.
Dude.
We
should
take
these
girls
Mine's
a
sexy
school
teacher...
and
yours...
hedges
funds.

Just
keep
doing
sexy
eyes.
Keep
doing
sexy
eyes.
I
like
Alice.
And
she's
smart,
she's
funny,
she's
weird.
MIKE:
We
invite
these
girls
to
the
wedding,
We're
winners!
TATIANA:
Here
they
come.
They're
coming.
Hey,
uh,
this
might
sound
crazy...
but
our
little
sister
is
getting
married
and
we
wanted
to
know
-
Um...

Can
you
just
give
us
a
second
to...
Of
course.
Okay,
so
just
whisper
like
we're
not
sure
if
we
wanna
go
or
not.
ALICE:
Oh,
like...
What
the
fuck
are
you
doing?
ALICE:
I
thought
we
wanted
to
go.
All
right,
fuck
it.
Let's
go
to
Hawaii!

Yes!
Fuck

Hi.
For

Let

get
you
gentlemen
checked
in,
yeah?
Holy
shit,
this
place
is
nice!
It's
gonna
be
more
nice.
Nice
girls
don't
show
off
their
ecstasy.
One
of
these
is
a
multivitamin.
Is
this
shit
free?
I
can
smoke
weed
out
of
this,
Look
at
that
teacher,
Look
at
that
personality
from
behind.
It
is,
dare
I
say...
-
well-rounded.
TATIANA:
Look
at
Mike.
He
looks
like
a
funhouse
mirror
version
but
he
is
just
that
dude.
Dave,
it
is
so
on
this
weekend.

I
am
not
touching
this
guy
He
thinks
just
because
he
brought
me
here
Check
it
out.
If
this
was
Mike's
dick,
I'd
be
like...
-

Doo,
doo,
doo,
doo,
doo...
I'd
get
close,
but
I'd
never
touch
it.
They
have
such
beautiful
flowers
here.
She's
throwing
out
I'm
like,
I'm
hungry.
I'm
gonna
butter
them
biscuits.
I'm
gonna
baste
them
ham
hocks.
I'm
gonna
be
like
a
sex
chef.
Mr.
Grey
will
see
you
now.
I'm
gonna
touch
Dave.
Every
time
he
says
something
sweet...
I
wanna
get
some
rope
and
chain
and
just
see
where
it
takes
us,
you
know?
That
is
messed
up.
Ladies,
your
wedding
itineraries.

DoingItForJeanie.
DAVE:
Today,
we
have
And
then
after
that,
Friday
is
the
rehearsal
dinner.
Mmm-hmm.
That's
where
Dave
and
I
are
gonna
be

ALICE:
Yeah,
'cause
I
gotta
I
gotta
call
my
stocks
It
happens
a
lot.
Mm-kay,
I
think
we
are
right
up
here.
Great.
So
which
one
Uh...
I
don't
know.
Or
I
was
thinking
that
maybe
you
and
I...
would
stay
in
the
same
room.
That
sounds
interesting...
but
I
don't
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea.
Why
not?

Because
I
don't
You
can
trust
me.
I
do
trust
you.
Let's
trust
each
other.
There's
so
much
trust.
Sorry.
I
didn't
mean
to
do
that.
I
respect
you
so
much,
Yeah,
we're
gonna
cover
for
up
to
$50
per
day.
Oh,
my
God.
You
don't
have
to
do
that.
I'm
a
very
strict
teacher.
You
be
Michelle
Pfeiffer
I'll
be
Coolio.
-
Coolio's
not
in
that
movie.
He
is
in
song
and
spirit.
I'm
gonna
call
and
tell
them
what
a
bad
boy
you
are.
Please
don't
tell
my
mommy.
Please
don't
tell
my
daddy.
I
think
Wi-Fi
is
included,
too,
so...
-
That's
always
nice.
Yeah.
If
I
were
to
give
you
a
grade,
A
big,
hard
D.
Why?
I
deserve
an
A.
-
What
are
you
talking
about?
Nothing.
In
conclusion...
I'm
gonna
stay
in
the
room...
with
Alice.
That
one,
with
Alice.
Cool,
cool.
No
doubt.
Somebody
overcooked
the
soft
pretzel.
My
dick
is
hard.
That's
what
I'm
saying.
Oh,
my
God.
Ew!

Lift
it,
drop
it,
shake
it
It's
going
down
for
real
It's
going
down
for
real
Grandma,
I'd
like
you
to
meet
Alice.
She's
super
smart,
great
conversationalist,
But
I'm
one
of
the
good
ones.

I
think
she
is.
TATIANA:
I
am
a
teacher,
yeah.
And
you
know
what?
You'd
be
surprised
how
stupid
they
are.

Jeanie!

-
Hey,
you!
I'm
so
proud
-
Tatiana.
Hi!
-
Oh,
the
bride.
The
gorgeous
bride.
This
weekend
is
all
about
you
-
Oh.
Thank
you.
Check
out
your
arms.
How'd
you
get
those
guns

Eric...
you
are
two
points
hotter
TATIANA:
Try
10
points
hotter.
-
Try
a
million.
-
Wow,
and
Jeanie,
nice
snag.
TATIANA:
I'm
liking
this.
Huh?
Maybe
you
two
-

I'll
just
keep
him
on
a
leash.
-
Maybe
don't
hurt
him.
I
like
these
girls.
They're
so
fun.
Unlike
my
maid
of
honor.
She's
having
a
time.
How
is
ol'
Becky
Grammerstein?

She's
coming.
-
Jeanie.
I'm
in
crisis
mode.
I
ordered
Prosecco
for
the
Mani-pedis...
and
all
they
have
is
champagne!
Aren't
they
the
same
thing?
-
No.
No,
they're
not.
No.
Hello,
Michael.
Hi,
Dave.
Look,
I'm
trying
to
make
your
dreams
-
Right.
If
this
is
bad
news,
-
Sorry.
Purple.
It
better
be
purple.
I
should
probably
go
see
to
that.
-
You'll
come?
Thank
you
so
much
for
being
here.
Guys,
good
job
with
these
two.

I

I
wanna
give
you
a
hug.
It's
so
nice
to
meet
you.
Fucking
A.
You
distracted
me,
man.
This
dress
is
lucky
to
be
on
you.
-
My
Mike?
-
I
can't...
Wow.
That's
fantastic.
Mike,
Tatiana
was
just
telling
me...
that
you
saved
her
life.
I
most
certainly
did,
Father.
You
see
how
great
it
is
-
I
mean,
these
are
nice
girls.
Absolutely.
They
are.
And
we
brought
them,
so...
KEITH:
Excuse
me.
Excuse
me.
See
you
in
a
minute.
Honey,

Can

everybody's
attention?

Put
your

his
lovely
bride,
Jeanie.

Give

up!
Jeanie!
Hey,
everybody.
A
big
thank
you
We
love
you,
Eric!
Thank
you.
And
to
my
own
family,
I
must
say...
Portland,
Oregon
in
the
house!

I'm
really
happy
-
which
means
"family."
And
as
the
Hawaiians
say...
Kale
maluna!
Which
translates
loosely
But
more
closely
translated,
"your
butts
to
the
sky"...
which
is
inappropriate.
This
is
gonna
be
magic.
Thank
you
all
again,
We
are
so
happy

Wedding.
Wedding.
Wedding.
-
Put
the
mic
on
the
stand.
-
Alice.
Hi!
What
happened?
You
sort
of
zoned
out
for
a
sec.
Yeah!
We're
at
a
wedding.
You
just
said
"wedding"
three
times.
I'm
fine.
Yeah!
Let's
just
forget
about
the
past,
To
the
bar!
To
the
bar?
Mmm.
Mmm.
Ooh.
I
don't
think
these
are
shots.
I
mean,
we're
drinking
'em
but
I
don't
think
they're
Your
face
is
funny.



Oh.
Hey,
Mike.
I
was
just
talking
Tatiana,
this
is
my
cousin,
Mike.
She
knows
who
I
am.
She's
my
date.
Why
would
someone
this
attractive
Are
you
gonna
hit
on
my
date
all
weekend,
I
don't
think
it's
gonna
take
all
weekend.
So,
you
guys
are
cousins?
She's
been
jealous
of
me
What
could
I
possibly
be
jealous
of?
Your
outfit
looks
like
Jimmy
Buffet's
Do
you
guys
always
do
this?
Okay,
this
is
actually
No,
you
look
like
the
wallpaper
TATIANA:
Cool.
while
you
guys
do
Okay?
Good
idea.
Look
at
that.
Pink
little
ass
just
bouncing
away,

Terry,
come
get
me
No,
it's
saying...

Mike,
crawl
up
in
this
Whoa.
What's
up,
double
trouble?
Terry.
Cousin
of
the
bride.
Get
at
me
later,
Don't
touch
her.
She
has
chlamydia.
-
Everybody
does.
Not
everyone
does.
Saw
you
and
Dave
are
doing
your
Mmm-hmm.
I'm
going
to
bring
the
house
down
And
why
do
you
think
You
know
Chris
Rock?
He's
my
neighbor.
And
he
gave
me
seven
killer
jokes.
Suck
on
that,
cousin.
Terry
out.
Chris
Rock?
Fuck!
That
sounds
awesome.
-



Oh,
my
God.
You
were
right.
I
know.
Being
a
good
girl
is
hard.
I
know.
It
sucks.
You
were
hitting
that
booze
You
need
to
get
Luke
out
of
your
head.
-
Yeah.
And
what
better
way
to
do
that...
than
good
old-fashioned
dick
flicks.
-
Yes.
Tatiana.
Mike
Stangle.
From
the
meet
and
greet.
One
second.
Fuck.
Hey.
It's
you.
It
is
me.
I
was
hoping
maybe
I
could
come
in

Do
whatever
you
wanna
do.
Why
are
you
whispering?
'Cause
that's
what
we
were
doing
before.
They've
got
Cockbusters.
Is
that
supposed
to
be
like
Ghostbusters?
Why
would
you
wanna
get
rid
of
the
cocks?
-
What's
that?
She
says
the
craziest
stuff
in
her
sleep.
It
looks
like
his
dick
is
gonna
pop.
-
Tatiana!
Julio.
My
student.
I'm
doing
and
he's
having
a
really
hard
time
If
you
don't
get
in
here,
Oh,
phooey.
I've
gotta
go.
That
sounds
like
you
guys
are,
-
No.
Does
it
smell
like
weed
in
here?
-
You
guys
smoking
weed?
I've
gotta
go,
because
a
bunch
of
kids
if
they've
failed
second
grade
or
not.
Well,
I
am
doing

are
getting
an
A
plus.
Thank
you
so
much.
Mmm.

WOMEN:
And

win!
BURT:
Cheers

Tatiana

Alice.
We're
so
glad
you're

MIKE:
Yes.
Cheers.

big
pile
of
shit."
"Oh,

not
so
scary,
little
guy."

What
is
going
on
here?
Oh!
Oh!
I
wish
we
could
do
that...
but
we
have
a
date
with
the
dolphins...
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean,
so...
Don't
you
think
we
should
do
I
mean,
it
is
her
wedding
after
all.
Right,
Mike?
I'm
so
happy
we're
here!
This
is
where

ALICE:

flocking
this
way!"
Here's
a
T-Rex!
"Life
finds
a
way."
Jeanie!
Eric!
Hey!
Hi!
Sorry,
I
lost
Eric.
I
wasn't
lost.
Stay
there.
We'll
come
to
you.
All
right,

better
go
around.
Oh,

Mike's
right.
It's
a
good
thing

ALICE:
Whoo!

Oh,
God!
Oh,
my
God,
she's
Superman!
Oh,
my
God!
A-Money!

Oh!
I
still
think
we
should
go
around.
She
just
got
some
serious
air,
bro!

You
call
that
serious
air?
Whoa!
Suck
my
clit,
fuckers!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Oh,
not
again.
Yeah,
baby!
Easy
does
it.
Nothing
fancy.

-
Oh,
my
God.
Look
at
what
she's
doing!
Sweet
candied
nuts.

Oh!
Who
are
these
girls?
Whoa!
Um...

Where
did
you
guys
learn
to
do
that?
-
We
lived
in
Baja.
Tore
up
a
lot
of
trail
down
there.
Made
a
lot
of
friends.
Made
even
more
enemies.
God,
I
miss
Baja.
Your
turn,
Mike!
Don't
be
a
pussy!
I'm
not
gonna
do
it.
TATIANA:
Mike,
it'll
turn
me
on
ERIC:
Turn
me
on
if
you
don't.
Still
not
going
to,
still.
I'm
not
gonna
do
it.
Like
we
would
ever
do
that.
-
No
way.
Come
on!
Do
it.
He's
not
gonna
do
it.
Do
it!
Do
not
do
it.
No,
definitely
don't
do
that.
It's
a
bad
idea.
It's
a
stupid,
dumb
idea.
-
And
it's
dangerous,
and
it's
foolish.
-
I'm
gonna
do
it!
Mike!

-
Oh,
shit!
Oh!
I'm
never
gonna
die!

-
Oh,
shit.
Oh,
no.
Keep
it
straight!
Oh,
he's
shanking
it.

Whoo!
Got
it,
got
it!


Oh,
no,
God!
Jeanie,
move!
No!
No!
No!
No!

It's
gonna
be
fine.
Your
face
is
making
me
think
I'm
sure
it's
not
as
bad
as
you
think.
-
You
know?
BECKY:
and
it'll
be
fine.
-
Okay.
-
Is
it
okay?
-
DAVE:
Oh,
my
God!
Wow!
Don't
you
look
good?
-

-
Your
face!
You
shut
up,
Becky!
Oh,
God!
What?
It
looks
like
you
were
making
meth,

You
look
like
Burn
Victim
Barbie.
Hush
it
up!
And
you're
Black
Ken.
-
Stop!
It's
like
an
exaggerated
smoky
eye.
Dave,
be
honest.
Is
it
bad?
This
side,
there's
a
little...
-
There's
a
little
discoloration
there.
Which
side
is
it?
DAVE:
You
could
do
a
dance
the
whole
night
where
you
just
hold
a
hand
over
your
face.
-
MIKE:
Oh,
that's
smart.
It's
like
a
new
thing.

Do
the
Jeanie,
do
the
Jeanie
Like
this?
-
Come
on,
everybody!
Do
the
Jeanie.
-
I'm
doing
the
Jeanie.
It's
a
one-two
step.
All
right,
that's
enough.
Enough
dancing!
You
and
you...
outside,
now!
Honey,
calm
down.

-
Honey,
calm
down.
Do
you
understand
they've
deformed
the
day
before
her
goddamn
wedding?
She
looks
like
Seal,
for
Christ's
sake!
Oh!
Why,
Dad?
Ow!
Do
you
think
he's
gonna
spank
us?
What?
Never
mind.
I
haven't
seen
him
this
pissed
OOP-
Yeah.
It's
the
other
door.
They
meet
in
the
middle.
-
They
meet
in
the
middle.
DAVE:
Dad,
listen.
-
You're
right.
-
Right?
Not
what
I
was
gonna
say.
Let's
Erin
Brockovich
this
bitch.
Mike,
stop!
You've
got
to
own
this.
It's
not.
If
anything,
it's
the
girls'
fault.
They're
crazy.
The
girls
aren't
the
problem!
You
are.
What
the
hell
did
you
think
What
did
you
think
was
gonna
happen?
We
had
a
plan.
The
plan
was
to
swim
with
dolphins...
and
eat
bananas
afterwards.
See,
Dad,
I'm
not
gonna
but
indirectly...
we
wouldn't
have
been
on
ATVs
And
who
made
us
bring
dates
-
Not
pointing
fingers.
All
right.
I'm
gonna
take
back
I
am
going
to
lump
you
in
together.
All
right,
you
are
lumped!
The
hell
is
wrong
with
you,
huh?
What
the
hell
is
wrong
with
you?
Dad.
Fuck.
Everyone
get
the
fuck
away
from
me.
Move!
Adult
Swim!
It's
all
fucked
now.
Jeanie's
special
weekend,
and
I
ruin
it.
Hey,
hey,
hey,
Alice?
That's
two
weddings
that
I've
ruined.
Look,
it's
too
bad
that
but
this
is
supposed
to
be
our
vacay.
Remember?
We're
supposed
and
going
on
adventures.
Get
in
here
with
me.
I'm
gonna
find
her.
No,
no!
You're
not
listening
to
me.

Ah!

Oh.
Hmm?
Thanks
again
for
letting
me
It's
not
like
you
asked
or
anything,
What
did
you
guys
do
Did
it
get
crazy?
where
you
go
to
Vegas
and
you
go
out
and
there's
a
contest...
to
see
who
can
get
the
most
money
but
then
you
tell
him,
and
they,
like,
beg
that
you
don't
tell
and
they
piss
themselves,
And
then
you
put
it
on
YouTube
Did
you
do
that
thing?
-
No.
I
didn't
actually
end
up
having
one,
so...
Why?
Every
bride
I'm
sorry
Cabo
didn't
work
out,
Jeanie.
I
know.
It's
fine.
You
know
I
couldn't
get
the
time
off
work.
And
it
would
have
ruined
it
for
you,
Is
there
some
tension
about
this?
So
I
just
thought,
"Let's
cancel
Jeanie,
can
you
keep
it
down?
Did
I
bring
up
something
uncomfortable?
Also,
I
caught
the
shingles

'Cause
it
feels
like
I
did.
BECKY:
Plus
they
have
Mexican
bed
bugs.

I
need
you
guys
to
stop
it!
Oh,
that
fucking
gaping
mouth
of
yours,
Shut
it!
I
just
want
to
relax!
Please!
I
just
wanna
relax.
KEANU:
How
are
you
feeling,
Jeanie?
A
little
stressed
out.
-
I'll
give
you
a
minute
to
disrobe.
Face
down
on
the
table.
Hi,
um,
that
is
my
best
friend
in
there...
and
she's
getting
married
tomorrow,
And
I
was
wondering
if
you
could,
um,
You
know?
Give
her
the
"Hawaii
Five
Oh"
experience?
The
wink-wink,
nudge-nudge
massage,
I
can't
really
wink,
-
Are
you
okay?
Looks
like
you
had
a
bit
of
a
fit.
No,
no.
That's
wink...
That's
wink-wink...
I
feel
like
I've
gotten
-
Great.
-
You
didn't
really
communicate
it
to
me.
Yes,
you
want
the
special
-
Yeah.
Um...
-
How
blissful
is
that?
Physically,
no
penetration.
Classy.
Spiritually,
I'll
be
doing
Oh,
you're
gonna
be
good
in
there.

How's
the
temperature
in
here,
Jeanie?
Oh,
it's
good.
Good.
Comfy.
Good.
Take
down
the
light
a
little
bit.
So
you're
getting
married,
huh?
I
am.
Yeah.
I
know
it
can
be
a
stressful
time.
You
know
it's
like,
"Who
is
this
for,
Yeah.
I've
recently
had
which
I'm
a
little
stressed
out
about.
Are
you
okay
with
oil?
Yeah,
sure.
-

they
call
oil
"God's
beautiful
lubricant."
It
sounds
better
in
my
language.

Oh,
that's
lovely.
'kay.
Some
ground
rules.
One,
no
emotions.
-
Okay.
Ahh...

Three,
there
is
no
penetration,

What
is
happening?
I
call
this
"The
Bent
Penguin."
This
one
is
just
"The
Ham
and
Eggs."
This
one
is
called
"When
Moons
Collide."
"Angry
Hummingbird."
"Angry
Hummingbird."
This
one
is
called
"House
by
the
Airport."
Just
checking
in.
Everything
good?
Hope
you're
enjoying
this.

-

This
one
is
just
called
A
little
break.
That's
nice.

Here
we
go
again.

Are
you
even
touching
me?
No,
but
my
aura
is.
Yes,
it
is!
Sweet
baby
Jesus!

-
How's
it
going?
Shit,
I
thought
I
was
alone
in
here.
Oh,
yeah.
You're
not.
I
mean,
we're
alone.
How's
Mike?
Still
really
jealous
of
me?
It's
like,
yeah,
okay,
Do
I
make
a
shit-ton
of
money,
Yes.
But
it's
like,
who
cares?
Do
I
get
backstage
tickets
to
Rihanna?
Do
I
have
a
glass
blowing
Hold
up,
backstage
tickets
to
Rihanna?
Yeah,
she
likes
to
have
me
around.
-
RiRi
is
Alice's
jam.
-
Yes.
She
would
freak
out
if
I
got
her
Well,
you
could
get
her
tickets.
Are
you
serious?
Oh,
God,
steam
rooms
just
open
up
They
open
up
everything.
Backstage
at
RiRi
is
very
fun.
You
know,
just
scratching
records.

Shit,
man.
That's...
Are
you
saying
you
want
me
to
No.
No,
no,
no.
No.

Yes.
Tatiana?
-
Tatiana?
Whoa.
Sorry
about
that.
Tatiana?
JEANIE:
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah...


Please
leave,
sir.
What
are
you
doing
to
my
sister?
-
Mike,
I'm
coming.



Get
out!

TERRY:
Oh,
sure.
Oh,
sure.
Oh,
sure.
So,
are
we,
like,
close,
or...
Let's
put
the
washing
machine

What
the...
Tatiana!
Terry!
Terry!
-
Tatiana!

Whoa!
MIKE:
I'm
gonna
kick
your
ass.

He
is
losing
this
fight!
Oh,
God!
I
can
see
your
nipple!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Get
your
butt
out
of
my
face!


Well,
thank
you
so
much.
Um,
I
definitely
needed
this.
I
know.
-
All
you
need
is
load-bearing
ribbons.
-
And
a
reinforced
ceiling.
I
should
warn
you...
you
may
experience
some
Oh.
So,
I
wouldn't
operate
any
heavy
machinery
That
is
not
a
euphemism
for
penis.
-
tractors,
cranes,
big
boats.
Good
to
know.
-
Oh,
and
please
hydrate.
I
cannot
stress
this
enough.
You
could
develop
cancer.
You
have
a
very
good
friend.
Wait,
you
did
that?
Yeah,
well,
I
felt
so
bad
and
I
wanted
to
make
it
up
to
you.
Aw!
Thank
you.
Hey,
who
needs
a
bachelorette
party

-
He
rubbed
my
butt.
But
with
his
butt.
It
was
like...
He
was
on
ribbons.
I
don't
know
what
you
did
but
she's
in
a
great
mood.
Yeah,
no
problem.
Oh,
um,
I
had
an
idea
for
your
graphic
novel.
I
thought
you
could
do
who's
like
Rastafarian,
and
he's
like...
"I'm
Rum
Rum,
get
in
my
tum-tum,

"You
can
rum,
but
you
cannot
hide,
man."
Yeah,
that's
awesome.
No,
that's
such
a
good
idea.
I
think
when
I
get
back,
and
start
drawing
full
time.
-
Really?
That's
amazing.
Do
you
know
how
few
people
But
then
I
think
about
and
he's
gonna
hate
that
idea.
He's
so
clingy.
When
we
were
kids,
he
would
always
wake
me
up
-
That's
kinda
sweet.
I
don't
know.
I
just...
Do
you
ever
get
that
feeling...
that
you're
not
good
enough
so
you're
too
scared
to
try?
All
the
time.
-
Really?
-
It
is,
it's
terrifying.
You're,
like,
stuck.
-
Totally.
Thanks.
It's
nice
talking
to
you
Hey.
Where
you
going?
Is
there
a
gang
bang
in
the
ballroom
Don't
be
such
a
drama
king.
Yeah,
I'm
totally
overreacting.
When
you
invite
someone
to
a
wedding...
they
obviously
are
supposed
to
That's
common
courtesy!
Okay,
hold
up.
I
am
a
grown-ass
woman.
I
can
finger
diddle
whomever
I
want.
Just
because
you
say
"whomever"
It's
not
a
big
deal.
-
Oh.
Swipe
right,
swipe
right,
swipe
left.
That's
very
graphic.
That
is...
Rotating
your
photos.
Are
you
deliberately
trying
to
hurt
me?
What?
No!
to
make
my
best
friend
feel
better,
okay?
We're
on
vacay.
No...
You
are
invited
to
my
sister's
wedding.
and
do
what
I
want
you
to
do.
That's
the
deal.
I
thought
that
we
had
a
connection.
Like
a
spark.
You
thought
you
were
gonna
bring
me
here
Yes.
No!
What?
Yeah,
right.
Really?
Yes,
obviously.
You
are
so
hot.
And
you
smell
good.
It's
not
a
weird
thing
that
I
wanna
have
because
you
are
very
sexy...
and
you
were
leading
me
on,
which
is
a
sexy
place,
God,
dude,
Alice
and
I
just
saw
you
on
TV...
-
wanted
to
go
to
Hawaii.
Fuck.
You
saw
us
on
TV?
No,
I
don't
even
watch
Wendy
Williams.
-

What?
-
What?
I
thought
you
dug
me.
Are
you
even
a
teacher?
No.
What
about
little
Julio...
the
dyslexic
boy
Made
it
up.
All
of
it.
Although
I
did
have
sex
and
I'm
pretty
sure
he
couldn't
read.
Here
I
thought
you
were
Michelle
Pfeiffer
Turns
out,
you're
Michelle
Pfeiffer
And
you
didn't
even


Oh,
come
on,
man.
Mike.

I'm
really
sorry.
Um...
I've
been
acting
crazy.
It's
probably
about
Luke,
my
ex.
Oh,
yeah.
The
guy
who
with
cancer,
and
AIDS,
and
stuff.
Yeah,
that's
the
one.
Except
none
of
that
stuff
happened,
I
lied.
You
lied?
I
can't
do
this.
Wait.
Sorry.
-
That's
okay.
That's
okay.
I
just
forgot
my
phone.
Sorry,
I
still
don't
want
to
get
married.

-

That's
almost
as
bad
Why
didn't
you
just
tell
me?
I
didn't
want
you
to
think
I
would
never
think
that.
"Love
hurts.
"Love
scars.
"Love
wounds,
and
mars."
That's
from
a
really
old
song,
Why
are
you
so
nice?

'Cause
I
think
you're
nice.
MIKE:
David!
David,
I
need
you
here
with
me
now.
No.
No.
Stangles,
assemble.
Now!
-
Let's
go.
Yeah,
I
think
he's
fine.
He's
just
got
a
lot
on
his
mind.
Let's
go!
Okay,
I'm
coming,
dude.
Jeez.

Oh...
I...
You
gave
me
a
boost
up.
Okay.
A
line
has
been
drawn,
David.
A
clear
line
in
the
sand.
Is
that
why
you
brought
me
so
you
could
literally
I'm
a
visual
thinker,
David.
-
God
damn
it!
These
girls,
they've
gotta
go.
They
pretended
to
dig
us
They're
liars!
So
what,
man?
So
they
lied.
I
was
talking
to
Alice.
You
have
no
idea
She
needed
this
trip.
We
should
be
practicing
our
speech
Not
babysitting
the
twins

Oh,
my
God.
Why
are
you
laughing
at
me?
You
sound
like
mom
and
dad
Well,
no,
fuck
that
noise.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Guess
what!
You're
gonna
love
this.
Tatiana
was
jerking
off
our
cousin
Terry.
-
What?
Cousin
Terry
has
a
dick?
No,
not
"jerking
off"
jerking
off.
The
female
version
of
jerking.
Dude,
let's
just
chill
out...
focus
on
Jeanie,
for
the
rest
of
the
weekend,
okay?
I
can't
do
that,
David.
Because
I
saw
our
little
sister...
What?
Well,
let's
just
say

What?
She
saw
a
ghost?

She
really
had
to
pee?

Doing
vocal
warmups?
What
are
you
doing?
She
was,
David!
With
the
masseuse.
-
What!
Oh,
my
God!
-
She
orgasms
like
a
star.
What's
next?
I'm
gonna
walk
in
on
mom
What's
a
Push
Pop?
I
made
it
up,
Dave.
-
What's
a
Push
Pop?
-
What's
a
Push
Pop?
What's
a
Push
Pop?
I've
been
to
the
bowels
of
the
Internet,
God,
just
tell
me!
What's
a
Push
Pop?
It's
a
whole
hand
up
an
ass,
David.
Is
that
what
you
want
me
to
say?
-
Oh,
God!
-
Oh,
God.
I'll
send
you
some
links.


-
We're
at
table
two.
-
I
said
table
two.
You're
out
of
control!
Thank
you.
Trouble
in
paradise?

Freaking
I
don't
care
if
I
cause
a
scene.
Freaking
I
will
punch
you
17,000
times
Take
a
shot.
You
look
like
Don
Johnson
Wait
till
Tatiana
hears
your
shitty
speech
She's
never
gonna
Thriller-Terry
out!

So
sad!
DAVE:
Oh,
my
God.
just
following
you
everywhere.
-
Like
The
Truman
Show.
Hey,
Dave!
Dave!
Hey,
what's
up?
I
need
you
to
come
backstage
right
now
Uh...
Dude,
I'm
kind
of
Which
is
a
conversation
Our
speech
needs
to
kill.
Terry
got
a
punch
up
from
Chris
Rock.
I
didn't
want
to
tell
you
before
I'm
not
freaking
out.
Calm
the
fuck
down,
Dave!
You
calm
the
fuck
down!
Mike,
you
look
like
You
gonna
come
or
what?
Let's
go.
I'll
see
you
backstage.

Uh...
-
I'm
gonna
go
deal
with
this
real
quick.
I'll
just
talk
to
myself
for
a
while.
ALICE
ON
PHONE:
What's
wrong
with
me?
TATIANA:
Don't
fucking
look
at
her.
Everybody
get
the
fuck
out
of
here.
Fuck
you,
Luke.
I'm
just
gonna
have


Hi!
-
Hi!
Did
you
need
to
No.
Why?
Are
you?

Well...
You
know,
you
think
that
warm
and
glowy...
and
absolutely
magical.
But,
then,
some
stuff
happens.
-
Sure
does.

Well,
if
you
want
I
have
just
the
thing.
I
don't
leave
home
without
it.

-
Ecstasy.
Every
bride
deserves
to
have
a
little
fun
Yeah.
I
deserve
to
have
a
little
fun.
You
are
so
nice
to
me.
Aww.
This
is
gonna
be
so
much
fun!

We
should
find
something
to
suck
on.
What?
Oh.
-

Here.
Put
these
on.
-
We
need
headsets?
There's
a
lot
of
dancing
Gotta
go
hands
free.
This
is
how
we
do
it,
baby.
Come
on.
Hey,
check
this
out.
I'm
going
to
"wedding
crash"
cousin
Terry.
What?
Put
a
few
eye
drops
in
her
drink.
That
way
she
shits
all
night,
Just
like
in
the
movie
Wedding
Crashers.
Mike,
that
is
a
terrible
idea.
-
You've
seen
the
movie!
-
You
love
that
movie.
How's
it
a
bad
idea
if
you
love
the
movie?
I
love
Taken.
But
we
shouldn't
wedding
crash
I'm
worried
about
you,
man.
I'm
really
worried
The
look
in
your
eyes
right
now...
You
haven't
blinked
Oh,
Davie,
Davie,
Davie!
What?
I've
never
been
in
more
control
-

-
Whoo!
This
is
really
intense.

Yeah,
it's
hitting
me
really
hard.
This
is
good
ecstasy.
I
don't
know.
I
wouldn't
know.
-
Wait,
what?
Why
would
you
take
ecstasy
on
the
night
before
your
wedding?
What?
That
is
so
baller!
Like
a
tiny
blonde
gangsta!
This
little
gangsta
would
kill

-
Do
you
wanna
go?
Okay,
let's
go.
Hello,
everyone.
Please
take
your
seats.
Welcome
to
the
rehearsal
dinner...
-
for
my
man,
Eric...
and
his
bride-to-be,
the
lovely
Jeanie.
They're
two
of
the
sweetest,
best
people
All
right.
Our
first
speaker
tonight...
is
resident
nasty
girl...
Cousin
Terry.

We
can't
let
Terry
crush.
It's
not
fair!
No.
Give
it
to
me.
My
eyes
are
dry.
Just
give
it
to
me.
Do
you
guys
know
who
Chris
Rock
is?
He's
my
neighbor,
and
he
helped
me
out
"My
speech."
Stop.
You're
wasting
it.
Mike,
this
is
baby
safe.
They
removed
the
active
ingredient,
It
worked
on
Wedding
Crashers!
That
was
not
real
life!
Now
let's
talk
about
destination
weddings!
It's
like
a
vacation...
without
the
relaxation!

That's
true.
Why
aren't
you
on
my
side,
Dave?
What?
I'm
done
with
this
shit,
man.
In
fact,
I'm
quitting
our
liquor
business.
There
it
is!
-
Really?
And
what
are
you
gonna
do?
I'm
gonna
draw!
I'm
gonna
work
on
my
graphic
novel,
Boom!
You
traitor!
TERRY:
I
ain't
gotta
rehearse!
I
know
how
to
eat
dinner.

Keith,
can
you
turn
me
up
a
little
bit?
MIKE
ON
SPEAKERS:
You
turn
your
back
Backstabbing,
treacherous
lying
coward!
Ooh,
I
don't
think
they
know
they're
on.
What?
Where
is
that
coming
from?
I
don't
know
what
I
did!
DAVE:
It
doesn't
matter,
Mike.
You're
losing
your
mind.
You
just
tried
to
poison
our
cousin
Terry!

Try
a
little
harder.
Am
I
right?
You're
goddamn
right
I
did.
Because
I
wanted
her
to
shit
That
is
unacceptable.
The
mics
are
on,
boys.
I
wanted
her
butt
to
explode
The
mics
are
on!
You're
just
fucking
pissed
off
-

It
was
for
tickets
to
Rihanna.
You're
sad,
man.
You
are
sad.
I'm
gonna
kick
your
ass
-

-
ALL:
Oh!
-
Do
you
wanna
go?
These
are
coming
your
way.
Just
stop!

God!
That
had
to
hurt.
-
Don't
do
it
again.
ALL:
Oh!


MIKE:
Why
do
you
keep
punching
me?
DAVE:
Why
do
you
keep
rushing
at
me?
Get
him,
Dave.
Oops,
who
said
that?
This
wedding
is
going
to
hell!
Yes.
MIKE:
They're
out
there,
And
they
don't
realize
the
bride...
is
getting
off
at
massage
parlors...
like
a
goddamn
Vietnam
War
veteran.

I
think
they
misunderstood
what
happened.
MIKE:
I
walked
in
and
saw
little
Jeanie...
the
bride-to-be,
orgasming.
The
masseuse
got
her
off.
God
damn
it!
Jeanie!
I
hate
you!


KEITH:
The
rehearsal
dinner
is
over.
Drinks
by
the
pool,
everybody.


Everything
feels
so
good,
right?
Yep.
You
know
what
Tell
me.
Eric
is
so
sweet
and
sensitive.
Kind,
good,
fiancé.
Probably
great
husband
and
stuff,
but...
Do
you
think
Eric
is
boring?
Boring?
Like
for
my
honeymoon...
all
I
wanted
to
do
to
different
countries
around
the
world.
And
just
be
surrounded
by
wicker.
We
could
have
wicker
picnic
baskets...
and
I
could
make
picnic
hats
We
would
be
wearing
-
And
he
vetoed
it.
Because
he
wants
to
go
to
a
resort,
-
...perch.
I
am
a
young
woman...
-
Preach!
-
Yes.
I
don't
even
know
what
Amsterdam
is
like.
I
haven't
been
to
Seattle.
You've
never
been
to
Seattle?
No!
-
Seattle's
gonna
change
your
fucking
life!
You
need
to
get
out
of
this
cage!
I
am
in
a
cage...
just
like
these
horses
are
caged.
Just
let
them
out.
Huh?
Let
them
all
out.
Be
free!
No
one
can
hold
you
down!
Be
free,
my
friends!
Follow
your
dreams!
Here
to
pile
on?
Go
ahead.
Any
insult
you
can
think
of...
I've
probably
told
myself
a
million
times.
Why
were
you
trying
to
poison
your
cousin?
I
was
jealous
of
the
whole
That
is
some
crazy
shit.
This
one
time
in
high
school...
this
bitch
tried
to
hit
on
my
boyfriend...
and
I
cut
off
her
ponytail
and
I
wore
it
to
school
for
a
month.
What
the
fuck?
But
you
tried
to
poison
your
cousin.
Look.
I'm
sorry
I've
been
so
rough
I
honestly
think
it's
You
act
all
confident...
but,
inside,
you're
scared
of
everything.
You
act
like
you
don't
care
but
you
really
care
what
people
think.
And
you
try
to
act
so
smart...
but
sometimes...
you're
just
afraid
I'm
so
dumb.
I'm
constantly
saying
words
Like,
I
use
this
word,
"assuage"...
all
the
time.
Can
you
assuage
me
the
ketchup?
Can
I
assuage
you
a
few
questions?
-
Is
that
the
meaning
of
it?
But
it's
like,
I'm
so
stupid...
but
I
act
all
confident,
And
it's
fucked
up.
Me,
too.
I'm
a
natural
born
leader.
Like
George
Washington.
Yeah.
Or
another
leader.
All
right,
here's
one.
But
I'm
about
to
get
super
real
I
thought
I
was
destined
but
I
may
never
achieve
anything.
Sister.
Have
you
been
reading
my
diary?
Yes.
Okay.
ALICE:
You
are
beautiful!
JEANIE:
On
to
Seattle!
Alice?
Am
I
glowing?
I
can
see
sounds
and
hear
colors.
-

What
the
fuck
are
the
horses
doing
out?
Who
the
fuck
are
you
guys?
Fucking
gypsies!
Francisco!
Francisco,
run!
Whoa!
Shit!
Hey.
Dave!
Hi.
What's
up?
What's
up
with
you?
-
What's
going
on?
Are
you
okay?
Yeah.
I'm
fine.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well...
Yeah.
See,
what
happened
was
that...
there
was
a
tsunami,
but
it
brought
these
horses.
What?
And
then,
we
wanted
to
get
naked
but
then
horses
can't
eat
chocolate.
They
could
have
an
aneurysm.
Where's
Jeanie?
Hey,
don't
yell
at
her
-
that
told
me
to
go
to
Seattle.
-
I've
always
wanted
to
go!
That
is
not
her
fault.
-
Oh,
my
eyes!
Stop
yelling.
Why
are
you
yelling?
You're
being
loud.
And
this
a
happy
time.
This
a
really
good
time.
There's
nothing
wrong.
So
who's
at
fault?
Did
you
know
that
Hitler's
parents
-
Do
you
have
any
water?
I'm
a
woman,
Dave.
Deal
with
it.

Because
this
is
the
bush
I
didn't
come
from
that
bush.
I
came
from
Mom's
bush.
And
you
know
that.
Jeanie!
Oh,
my
God!
You're
completely
naked!
-
Hi,
Becky!
-
You
look
tall.
I
told
you
to
stay
away
Alice,
seriously,
are
you
tripping?
No.
God,
no.
Why
would
say
that?
Please.
Just
tell
me
the
truth.
Are
you
on
drugs?
We're
super
fucked
up.
Yeah.
What?
We
started
with
ecstasy,
Why
the
fuck
would
you
do
that?
Don't
you
judge
me,
David.
I
don't
think
you're
supposed
to
the
night
before
the
wedding.
We
brought
you
here
But
Mike
was
right
about
you
two.
This
whole
wedding
weekend
Dave,
I'll
be
honest
with
you.
I
need
some
clothes.
I
can't
continue
to
wear
this
horse.
Oh,
my
God.
Oh,
the
wind
feels
so
nice.
Come
on,
come
on,
come
on.

We
should
go
in
the
ocean.
I'm
so
thirsty!
Dave,

Please,
please,
please,
I
love
this
song.
There's
no
music
playing.
JEANIE:
Baby,
wait.
Don't
worry.
Only
our
butts
touched.
Stop
it.
Don't
freak
out
anymore,
Pumpkin!
Don't
freak
out?
Don't
freak
out?
Tell
me
one
thing.
Did
you
enjoy
it?
No.
That
is
such
a
"yes"
no.
No.
I'm
gonna
ask
you
again.
Did
you
enjoy
it?
Yes!
Oh.
Well...
Cat's
out
of
the
frigging
bag,
isn't
it?
JEANIE:
I
went
for
a
normal
massage...
but
Alice,
she
had
asked
And
then
it
just
kept
coming,
Who
are
these
fucking
girls
You
are
clearly
on
drugs.
And
we're
getting
married
tomorrow!
I'm
scared,
Pumpkin.
Aren't
you
scared?
Well,
yeah,
now
I
am.
JEANIE:
It's
just
that...
I'm
just
a
little
worried
that
you
are...
boring.
What
are
you
saying?
You
don't
want
to
marry
me?


Well...
No,
she
doesn't
mean
that.
because
she's
just
rolling
You
rolled
her!
-
You're
the
roller!
I
was
gonna
draw
Rum
for
you.

You've
made
me
so,
so
sad.
But
a
little
bit
mad.
But
mostly
just
sad.
Oh!
-
Dad!
Mike,
for
once
in
your
life...
please
don't
say
a
fucking
word.
I
hate
them
sometimes.
Fucking
love
them
and
they're
dicks.
Sometimes
I
love
them,
Everything
okay
over
there?
I
can't
find
my
other
sock.
Did
you
take
my
sock,
bro?
No.
I
think
you
took
my
fucking
sock,
bro.
God
damn
it.
I
can't
believe
Jeanie
and
Eric
and
it's
all
our
fault.
It's
slightly
our
fault.
It's
totally
our
fault.
Fuck.
We
got
selfish.
We
got
distracted.
I
don't
think
we
were
We
weren't
#DoingltForJeanie.
Our
fucking
little
sister.
She
is
Stanglita.
The
one
little
girl
The
Stangle
Dangle.
The
smallest
plane
in
the
Stangar.
Don't
do
it,
dude.
We're
supposed
to
be
her
protector.
Don't
you
cry.
We're
supposed
to
look
out
for
her.
Stop
it.
We're
supposed
to
be
the
two
dudes
If
you
start,
I'm
gonna
start.
We
broke
up
her
marriage.
Of
course
I'm
fucking
doing
it,
man.
I'm
doing
it,
too.
-


Oh,
man,
we
fucked
up
this
wedding.
Yeah.
We
fucked
it
in
the
dick.

You
know
I
don't
like
it
when
you
say
that.
I
know,
but
we
fucked
it
so
hard.
Fuck.
I
think
the
reason
we
get
ourselves
we're
always
telling
each
other
when
we're
definitely
not
being
awesome.
That's
deep.
Yeah,
you
know
what?
Um...
I
wanted
you
to
feel
better...
and
get
your
groove
back...
but
not
all
the
way
better
to
where...
you
wouldn't
need
me
anymore.
Because
if
you
don't
need
me...
then
nobody
needs
me,
and,
um...
Anyway,
that's
what
I
was
thinking
Dude,
we're
always
gonna
need
each
other.
Okay.
Okay,
here's
the
thing.
But
I
think
occasionally...
we
should
think
about
Like
Jeanie?
Yeah,
like
Jeanie.
-
Oof.
Oh,
fuck.
This
feels
fucking
terrible.
This
does
not
feel
good.
Like,
Dave's
so
special
and...
He
must
be
so
mad
at
me.
Poor
Mike.
He's
less
special,
They
must
be
so
mad
at
us!
They
must
hate
us.
Fuck!
I
would
hate
us.
I
would
fucking
hate
us!
I
hate
us,
man.
I
hate
us!
I
hate
us,
too!
But
you're
the
best,
dude.
I
love
you.
Don't
lump
yourself
in
with
me.
I'm
like
a
little
troll...
who
lives
on
nothing
but
Your
drawing?
-
So
go.
You
go
right
now.
Go!
Don't
let
your
loser
older
brother
You
are
not
a
loser.
Thanks,
Dave.
Dude,
you
introduced
me
Taught
me
Donatello
was
a
pussy.
That
Raphael
was
actually
dope...
because
he
didn't
give
a
fuck
He's
cool,
but
rude.
Exactly.
When
all
those
kids
kicked
at
me
you
stopped
eating
muffins
They
were
too
moist.
Made
you
an
easy
target.
You're
my
brother.
And
I
love
you.
Heroes
in
a
half
shell.
Turtle
power.

We're
not
going
anywhere...
until
our
little
sister,
is
getting
married.


You
just
killed
the
TV.
I
was
aiming
for
it.
MIKE:
We
are
such
idiots.
We
are
so
stupid.
We
ruined
your
whole
wedding...
and
we
finally
just
realized
that.
All
right.
Please
just
stop
talking,
okay?
Not
another
word.
My
head
hurts
so
bad.
Jeanie,
Eric.
We
can't
let
you
not
get
married
DAVE:
We
love
you
so
much,
Jeanie.
We
love
you,
Eric.
-
Just
love
each
other.
-

Jeanie,
Eric.
We
can't
let
you
not
get
married.
ALICE:
Yeah.
Just
because
I
mean,
we
want
you
guys
Love
each
other.
Okay.
This
is
bizarre,
BOTH:
...exact
same
thing.
We're
even
doing
this
hand
motion.
Yeah,
all
that
was
ours.
The
point
is,
this
shit
is
all
our
fault.
No,
it's
our
fault.
No,
it's
definitely
our
fault.
It
is
our
fault
for
sure.
No,
no,
no.
For
real.
If
anything,
it's
my
fault.

Shh!
Please
stop.
Everyone
shut
the
fuck
up!
Jesus
Hussein
Christ.
God
damn
it!
Been
trying
to
read
this
same
paragraph...
for
20
minutes.
But
you
four
fucking
morons
We've
only
been
here
for
three
minutes...
so
those
other
17
minutes...
-
that's
kind
of
on
you...
I'm
using
hyperbole.
I
don't
know
what
that
means,
Mike,
do
me
a
favor.
Shut
the
fuck
up.
Go
Eric.
Shut
up
too!
I
mean,
God
damn
it!
You're
all
self-absorbed,
codependent
weirdos!
-
Yeah.
-
MIKE:
That's
pretty
spot-on.
-
Those
are
not
good
qualities.
-
It's
been
a
long
time.
We're
both
very
confused.
ALICE:
No,
no.
You're
not
confused.
You're
just
coming
down
off
MDMA.
Sorry.
Which
I
gave
you.
And
Eric,
you
can't
blame
her
I've
done
so
much
stupid
shit
on
E.
I
got
so
dehydrated
that
and
I
had
to
go
to
the
hospital...
'cause
puddles
are
really
dirty.
DAVE:
One
time
I
was
on
peyote...
and
I
signed
up
for
a
T-Mobile
plan.
TATIANA:
One
time
I
got
high.
I
read
the
back
of
a
shampoo
bottle
Because
it
said
"repeat."
-
Rinse
and
repeat.
Jeanie,
I
know
you
think
Enough
of
this
talk
of
boring!
Damn
it!
Sixty
percent
of
my
investments
I
don't
always
look
both
ways
I've
been
known
to
have
with
my
dinner,
every
now
and
then.
I
once
went
to
see
a
movie...
walked
across
the
hallway,
Didn't
pay
till
after.
Is
that
boring?
Is
that
boring?
-
What'd
you
say?
-
You're
right.
We
were
wrong.
Well,
how
about
this
for
boring?
-
Bam!
Two
hot
air
balloon
tickets

I
know
you
really
wanted
to
go...
so
I
got
these
tickets
a
while
ago
Surprise.
ALL:
Aww!
Baby,
you're
so
afraid
of
heights.
-
Baby,
I'm
fucking
terrified
of
heights.
But
my
biggest
fear...
is
to
not
be
the
husband
that
you
deserve.
JEANIE:
Baby,
I'm
sorry
but
I
promise
that
masseuse...
He
didn't
touch
my
lavender
juice
box.
Oh
God,
baby.
I
love
you.
And
I
know
I
want
to
marry
you.
Today,
if
you'll
still
have
me.
Babe,
of
course.
Are
you
kidding
me?
Kiss
her.
Baby,
I'm
crazy
about
you.
BOTH:
Aww!
I
want
to
marry
you
right
now...
but,
baby,
we
already
canceled
I
don't
think
they're
going
to
Leave
that
to
us.

Leave
that
to
all
of
us.
-
Yeah!
This
way!
Oh,
fuck!
We'll
actually
just
head
around.
-
Girl.
So
what
part
you
like,
brah?
-
We
need
the
whole
pig.
But
we
need
to
feed
100
people.
Could
we
please,
please
For
the
last
time,
we're
out
of
venues.
-
Hold
me
back.
Hold
me
back,
please.
Give
us
a
place!
Everybody
out
of
the
way!
It's
hot.
So
hot!
-
Out
of
the
fucking
way!
What
if
I
supplied
all
the
liquor...
for
every
bar
in
this
hotel...
at
wholesale
prices
-
Deal.
I'll
get
you
guys
a
venue.

Ahh!

BECKY:
Keith,
get
it
together.
We
need
to
move,
move,
move.
I'm
doing
my
best.
Hell
yeah!

DAVE:
And
now...
a
reading...
from
the
children's
book
-
Oh.
"Aloha
sea.
"Aloha
you.
"Aloha
me."
-
I
do.
MIKE:
By
the
power
vested
in
me...
by
the
website
www.beyourowndeacon.com...
I
now
pronounce
you
husband
and
wife.
Those
assholes
kind
of
did
it.

Yeah.
Those
assholes
kind
of
did.
You
may
kiss
the
bride.
MIKE:
Okay.
Kiss
the
bride.
Kiss
the
bride.

Uh-huh.


Yeah!

-
MIKE:
You
designed
this?
Insane.
We're
at
a
wedding,
That
was
a
really
good
idea.
I
have
so
many
good
ideas.
At
my
last
job,
I
was
on
fire
with
ideas.
Huh?
Actually,
I
need
a
new
partner...
because
Dave
is
bailing
on
me
Would
you
wanna...
maybe
come
work
for
me?
Really?
What
do
you
know
about
liquor?
Um,
only
that
it's
delicious
and
I
love
it.
And
those
are
You
are
hired.

Great.
When
do
I
start?
You
can
start
right
away...
but
just
know
that
there

Keep
it
in
your
pants,
okay?
If
we're
going
to
work
together,
keep
it

Okay.
-
We'll
keep
it
professional,
then.
-
All
right.
-
Okay.

Okay.

Are
you

Excuse

Could

My

Mike
and
Dave
have
asked
so
we
would
like
to
invite
them
up.
Come
on,
boys.
Thank
you,
Jeanie.
We
never
got
to
give
our
speech
Because
we
ruined
it.
With
fights.
But
we
just
wanted
exactly
how
we
feel
about
you.
MIKE:
Lights.

You

this
was
coming?

I

man's
thumb.
Dave

13
Pokemon
pugs
shoved
up
my
butthole.
I
just
had
to
wait
to
poop
them
out.
Pikachu.
Pikachu.
Charmander.
That's
okay.
No,
no.
Keep
your
dick
in.

For
most
of
