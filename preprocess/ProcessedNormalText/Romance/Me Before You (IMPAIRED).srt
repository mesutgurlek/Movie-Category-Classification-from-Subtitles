ALICIA:
Now,
you
see,
this
is
Not
all
the
hiking-up-mountains
stuff

Tickles.
Tickles.
You
want
me
to
stop?
No.
But
it's
6:15.
-
6:15?
Oh,
I
gotta
go.
I'll
cook
tonight.
ALICIA:
Don't
even
think
about
it.
It's
pouring.
-
Freddie!
Ooh,
whoa!
Yeah,
listen,
I'm
on
it.
All
right,
the
West
Coast
I'll
call
Carmichael
now
Taxi!
Yeah,
we
won't.
Don't
worry.
-
MAN:
Look
out!
JOHN:
Bye
now!
LOU:
Take
care,
John!
CUSTOMER:
Um...
How
many
in
this
one?
LOU:
170
calories.
You
did
have
that
one
yesterday.
What
about
that
one,
then?
220.
But
it
is
less
-
BOTH:
Oh!
-
Please.
Come
on.

I
don't
think
I
can
finish
this.
Shall
we
wrap
it
up
for
you,
Daphne?
Have
it
later?
Yeah.
I'm
really
sorry.

BERNARD:
A
month's
money.
Given
she's
worked
like
a
Trojan
He's
closing
down,
love.
He
had
no
choice.
What
the
hell
is
she
gonna
do
now?
Treena
can't
get
any
more
Lou
will
get
another
job.
There
are
no
jobs,
Josie.
I
should
know.
Look,
I'm
just
saying,
Let's
not
panic,
eh?
She'll
find
something.
Won't
you,
Lou?
MAN:
That's
it,
Callum!
Go
on!
PATRICK:
Run
with
me,
babe!
-
Come
on!
-
Only
got
two
laps
to
go.
You
just
gotta
get
back
out
there.
Think
what
you
wanna
do.
-
Estate
agent,
maybe.
-
Shop
assistant.
Catering.
Do
we
have
to
discuss
this
again?
Well,
you
can't
just
mope
around.
All
the
best
entrepreneurs,
they
fight
Just
look
at
me,
eh!
Oh!
But
I'm
not
you,
Pat.
I
toast
tea
cakes.
Look,
can't
you
slow
down?
I'm
wearing
the
wrong
bra.


I'm
just
saying,
put
on
a
smile,
Don't
worry
about
the
holiday.
I'll
pay.
-

So
the
last
two
weeks,
we've
tried
I'm
still
having
nightmares
-
We've
tried
beautician.
I'm
running
out
of
options
Syed,
please!
I'll
take
anything.
SYED:
Oh!
This
is
new
in.
It's
not
far
from
your
home.
But
you
might
need
to
do
something
Hmm?
Care
and
companionship
for
a
disabled
man.

What
kind
of
care?
Needs
someone
to
drive,
feed
and
assist.
Six-month,
fixed-term
contract.
Oh!
And
it's
good
money.
It's
actually
excellent
money.
It's
the
fifth
time
They're
desperate.
There's
nothing
on
here
It's
perfect
for
you.
Yeah?
I
know
it's
not
how
you
like
to
dress.
Is
it
how
anyone
likes
to
dress?
-
It
served
me
very
well.
In
1983!
Styles
change,
love,
-
but
smart
remains
smart.
-
Thank
you.

-

-
You
must
be
Louisa
Clark.
I'm
Camilla
Traynor.
Do
come
in.
Please,
sit
down.
Oh,
okay.
Do
you
have
any
experience
of
caregiving?
Um,
I've
never
done
it,
Do
you
have
any
experience
Er,
no.
We
are
talking
about
complete
and
very
limited
use
Would
that
bother
you?
Not
as
much
as
it
would
Sorry.
Sorry.
No,
I
didn't...
No,
uh...
-

-
Are
you
all
right?
I'm
just
a
little
hot.
Do
you
mind
if
I
take
off
my
jacket?
Your
previous
employer,
here,
says
you
are
a
warm,
chatty
and
life-enhancing

Yes,
I
paid
him.
So,
what
exactly
do
you
Sorry?
Do
you
have
aspirations
for
a
career,
or
a
professional
dream
-
Um,
well...
why
should
I
employ
you
Um...
Really,
you
can't
think
of
a
single
reason
Well,
no.
Yes,
Mrs.
Traynor.
I'm
a
fast
learner.
And
I'm
never
ill.
And
I
only
live
on
And
I'm
stronger
than
I
look.
I
make
a
mean
cup
of
tea.
You
know,
there
really
isn't
much
that
Not
that
I'm
saying
that
your
husband's
-
can
be
solved
by...
It's
my
son.
Your
son.
Will
was
injured
in
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
When
I'm
nervous,
I
just
say
stupid
stuff.
-

Oh,
another
interviewee.
Will
you
be
back
this
evening?
I'll
do
my
best.
Why?
No,
darling.
Fine.
Hello.
I'm
Stephen.
Will's
father.
-

Louisa
Clark.
Nice
to
meet
you.
Lovely
to
meet
you.
-
See
you
later,
darling.
-
So.
Hmm.
Would
you
like
the
job?
Yes!
Can
you
start
immediately?
Yes!
Good.
Then
let's
go
and
meet
Will.
Right,
yeah.
Okay.
Um,
sure.
The
hours
are
8:00
to
5:00,
If,
for
whatever
reason,
you're
running
-
please
call
and
let
me
know.
I
must
stress
that
Will
should
not
be
And,
uh...
You
might
want
to
wear
something
Oh,
yes,
of
course.
This
is
the
annex.
It
was
the
stables
before
Um,
I'll
give
you
a
set
of
car
keys,
Nathan
will
show
you
how
to
use
the
ramp.
There's
a
bathroom
in
here.
Tea
and
coffee
are
in
this
cupboard
here.
You're
welcome
to
help
yourself.
And
there
is
always
food
in
the
fridge.
You
and
Will
can
work
out
Um,
obviously...
Well,
I
would
hope
that
you
could
get
on.
It
would
be
nice
if
he
could
rather
than
a
paid
professional.
Do
you
have
any
questions?
No.
Then
let's
introduce
you
to
Will.
He
should
be
dressed
by
now.

He
has
good
days
and
bad
days.
Mrs.
Traynor,
I
won't
let
you
down.
Good.
-

NATHAN:
Yeah,
he's
decent,
Mrs.
T.
Will,
this
is
Louisa
Clark.

I'm
Lou!

-
CAMILLA:
Will.
William.
William,
please.
Hello,
Louisa
Clark.
I'm
Will
Traynor.
You
appear
to
have
a
problem
You're
a
bad
man,
Mr.
T.
G'day.
I'm
Nathan.
CAMILLA:
Right.
Well,
I'll
leave
you
to
get
on.
Miss
Clark,
Nathan
will
talk
you
You
don't
have
to
talk
across
me,
Mother.
My
brain
isn't
paralyzed.
Yet.

I'm
Lou!
Yeah.
You
already
said
that.
Shall
I
make
us
all
a
cup
of
tea?
Wrench!
Where's
my
wrench?
Mum,
did
you
turn
down
the
gas
on
my
veg?
That's
the
cutlery
drawer,
Bernard.
And
you're
getting
oil
everywhere.
Everything
will
be
soggy
again.
Yeah,
well,
things
turn
up
in
-
Auntie
Lou!
Auntie
Lou!
-
You
got
it,
didn't
you?
Yeah!

Yay!
Louisa
Clark,
working
for
the
Traynors.
Wonders
will
never
cease.
-
LOU:
Uh,
yeah.

NATHAN:
Okay.
This
tells
you
pretty
much
Now,
I
do
most
of
the
heavy
lifting,
but
there's
a
timetable
here
I
have
to
handle
drugs?
Blood-pressure
meds
to
raise
it
Anti-spasm
tablets.
Four
times
a
day
Tablets
for
nerve
pain.
Um,
now,
you
can
give
him
Just
try
to
resist
giving
him
They
tend
to
make
him
No,
uh...
More
irritable.
It's
a
lot
to
remember.
Well,
it's
all
written
down.
You
know,
he
knows
what's
what.
Though,
he
might
deny
it.
And
you
got
my
number.
Most
of
my
other
patients
are
nearby,
What
if
he
needs
to...
Uh...
No,
don't
worry.
You're
not
here
for
What
am
I
here
for?
To
cheer
him
up,
I
guess.
Hello.
Hello.
LOU:
So
I
thought
we
could
WILL:
Where
do
you
have
in
mind?
Well,
I
was
told
that
you
had
a
car
And
you
thought
a
drive
A
breath
of
fresh
air.
What
do
you
usually
do?
I
don't
do
anything,
Miss
Clark.
I
sit.
I
just
about
exist.
Okay.
Well,
I
could
get
you
your
computer.
Have
you
found
a
good
quad
Quads
"R"
Us?
The
Tin
Wheels
Club?
Or
perhaps
we
could
You
know,
because
then
you
could
tell
me
May...

Maybe.
Here's
what
I
know
about
you,
Miss
Clark.
My
mother
says
you're
chatty.

Yeah.
Can
we
strike
a
deal?
Whereby
you
are
very
un-chatty
around
me?
Okay.
Yeah,
well,
I'll
just
be
in
the
kitchen
Lovely.

NATHAN:
So,
how
was
he?
He
done
his
Stephen
Hawking
impression
yet
Ah,
he's
fine!
Okay.
Well,
you
can
take
lunch
now.
Me
and
Mr.
T.
have
a
few
things




Good
morning!
Hi!
Not
a
great
day.
Would
you
like
a
cup
of
tea?


-
Sorry.
WILL:
Val
d'lsère.
Good
snow
that
year.
Sorry.
I
was...
I
was...
You
were
just
looking
at
my
photographs,
thinking
how
awful
it
must
be
to
have
The
rest
are
in
the
drawer
-

Good
morning.
LOU:
Every
time
I
speak,
TREENA:
To
be
fair,
you
are
pretty
stupid.
-
Yeah,
but
he
doesn't
know
that
yet.
Maybe
he's
like
that
with
everyone
until
he
I
mean,
it's
only
been
10
days.
Feels
like
a
lifetime.
Well,
you
can't
quit,
Lou.
Yeah?
Watch
me.
Um...
Look,
I'm
thinking
of
Someone's
dropped
out
of
business
studies
What?
What
about
Thomas?
There's
a
nursery
on
campus.
-

I
don't
think
I'm
ever
gonna
I
need
this.
Oh,
I
get
it.
You
just
need
me
to
stay
here
in
my
-
I've
done
my
fair
share.

I
can't
stay
here.
You
know
I
can't.
Please,
for
me
and
Tom.
Louisa,
some
visitors
are
on
their
way.
Friends
of
Will's.
It's
unexpected.
You
might
need
to...
Oh,
I'll
make
some
tea
or
coffee.

And
I'll
make
myself
scarce.
Yes,
that
would
be
good.
I
think
I'll...
I
think
I'll
leave
them
to
it.
RUPERT:
So
how's
the
physio
and
stuff?
All
coming
on?
Any
improvements?
No.
Well,
you
look
great.
-
Yeah.

So.
To
what
do
I
owe
this
pleasure?
I'm
sorry
it's
been
so
long.
They've
been
really
working
me
hard.
Yeah,
things
are
manic
at
the
office,
too.
New
chap
from
New
York.
Bains!
You
ever
come
across
him
at
all?
No.
Fearsome.
Total
monster!
Most
days
I
feel
I
can

ALICIA:
Please
say
something.
Congratulations.
Neither
of
us
meant
for
this
to
happen.
We
were
just
friends
for
ages.
And
if
truth
be
told,
Rupert
was
the
most
Big
of
him.
Oh,
Will,
please.
I...
We
should
probably
go.
I'm
sorry,
Will.
I
really
am.
We
both
are.
And
I...
We
really
do
hope

Thank
you.
You
know,
I
tried
for
months.
He
just
pushed
me
away.
You
can
only
help
someone
I
was
wondering
if
you
wanted
me
to...

Right,
well,
you
better
not
move
I've
got
no
idea
what
I'd
do
It
was
awful!
It's
his
girlfriend
and
his
best
friend.
You
can't
blame
her.
Are
you
really
saying
that
if
I
was
paralyzed
from
the
neck
down?
Of
course
I
would.
Well,
I
wouldn't
want
someone
I
mean,
strangers
wipe
your
arse.
Jesus!
And
think
of
all
the
things
No
more
running,
no
more
cycling.
No
more
sex.

Of
course,
you
could
have
sex.
It's
just
the
girl
would
-
Oh,
well,
we'd
be
doomed,
then.
-
Hey,
listen.
-
About
the
holiday.
-
How
do
you
fancy...
Norway?
Norway.
Wow.
Yeah!
Okay.
Whoo!
-
Great!

Boys,
I'm
in.
-
What?
Um,
no,
wait.
The
Viking
Triathlon.
Sixty
miles
on
a
bike,
30
miles
on
foot,
and
then
a
nice
swim
Yeah!
That's
our
holiday?
Yeah,
but
not
all
of
it.
Just
the
beginning,
Look,
I
have
never
been
fitter,
Lou.
This
is
the
year
to
do
it.
I
just
thought
I'd
see
Or,
um,
if
you
wanted
to
get
new
ones,
Or
we
could
both
go.
Do
you
know
what,
Louisa?
Me
smashing
those
photographs
Sorry.
I
didn't
think...
You
thought
you
knew
best.
Well,
I
don't
want
those
every
time
I'm
stuck
in
bed,
waiting
for
I
wasn't
going
to
fix
the
one
of
Alicia.
I'm
not
that
stupid.
Spare
me
the
cod
psychology.
Just
go
and
raid
your
grandma's
wardrobe,
or
whatever
it
is
you
do
You
don't
have
to
be
an
arse!
Your
friends
got
the
shitty
treatment.
Fine.
They
deserved
it.
I'm
just
trying
to
do
my
job
So
it
would
be
really
nice
if
you
didn't
as
you
apparently
make
everyone
else's.
What
if
I
said
I
didn't
want
you
here?
I'm
not
employed
by
you.
So
unless
she
says
she
doesn't
want
me
Not
because
I
care
about
you,
but
because
I
need
the
money.
I
really
need
the
money.
Just
put
them
in
the
drawer.
Hi.
Am
I
needed?
DVD
weather,
I
think.
Des
Hommes
Et
Des
Dieux.

Something
about
men?
Yes,
it's
French
gay
porn.
You
really
don't
enjoy
sarcasm,
do
you?
Sarcasm
is
fine.
You
must
hate
me,
then.
I've
never
hated
anyone.

Let
me
know
if
you
need
anything.
Have
you
seen
it?
I
don't
really
like
those
kind
of
films.
Those
kind
of
films?
Films
with
subtitles.
What,
did
your
school
Sit
down.
Watch
this
with
me.
That's
an
order.



-
So?
-
They
chose
to
stay.
Being
there
gave
their
lives
more
meaning.
-
But
that's...
Well,
to
sacrifice
themselves
like
that!
I
mean,
could
you
even
imagine?
But
you
liked
the
film?
I
loved
it.

Oh,
if
you're
laughing
at
me,
I
swear
I'm
not
laughing
at
you.
The
sky
is
clearing.
I'm
just
amazed
that
you
could
Twenty-six.
Twenty-six,
and
never
have
Oh,
well,
I'm
just
amazed
without
being
locked
in
a
cupboard

What?
E.
T.
is
my
favorite
film.
E.
T.
is
everyone's
favorite
film.
-
I've
seen
every
Bond.
And
I've
got
a
soft
spot
for
Armageddon.
Bruce
Willis.
Oil
driller
has
to
save
the
world
That's
better.
So
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
I,
uh...
I
spend
time
with
my
family.
And
I
go
to
the
pub.
I
watch
TV.
I...
Oh,
I
watch
Patrick
running.
-
Patrick's
your
boyfriend?
But
you
don't
run
with
him?
I'm
not
exactly
built
for
it.
This
is
an
impressive
list
of
hobbies.
Well,
no,
no.
Okay,
I
read
a
bit.

And
I
like
clothes.
You
like
clothes?
I
don't
do
much,
okay?
I
go
to
work
and
I
go
home,
and
that's
it.
Wow.
Your
life's
even
duller
than
mine.
He's
in
a
good
mood.
He
told
me
all
about
you
offering
him
I've...

I've
never
No,
whatever.
It's
all
good.
It's
a
long
time
since
Hey.
NURSE:
Hello
there,
Mr.
Traynor.
How
are
you
doing
today?
Nathan,
what
are
they
doing
in
there?
He
has
a
checkup
every
six
months.
To
see
if
he's
getting
better?
No,
it's
a
spinal-cord
injury.
He's
not...
He's
not
going
to
get
better.
But
you
do
all
those
exercises
with
him.
Yeah.
That's
to
stop
Will's
body
no
longer
works
below
here.
Yeah,
but
he's
still
trying,
right?
He
threw
everything
and
all
he
got
from
it
was
Then
the
first
bout
of
pneumonia
hit,

What
does
that
mean?
Right.
So
his
blood
pressure
-
goes
up
and
down.
He's
constantly
open
to
infection.
But
there's
medical
advances
Well,
yeah.
But
no
one's
worked
out
Oh,
I
hear
this
one's
good.
Oh,
because
we
suddenly
speak
Spanish?
No,
it's
got
subtitles.
It
gets
so
you
don't
notice
after
a
while.
-

Oh.
Is
he
okay?
He's
not
great.
Bit
of
a
chill.
Where's
Nathan?
I've
called
him.
He'll
be
here
soon.
Look,
Camilla's
had
to
go
up
to
London.
Are
you
going
to
be
all
right?
-
Of
course.
Yeah.
I'm
on
my
mobile,
if
you
need
me.
Okay.
Will,
can
I
do
anything?
My
pillows
aren't
right.
Um,
what
do
I
do?
Put
your
hand
under
my
head,
Okay.
-
Oh,
Jesus.
Your
hands
are
freezing.
Better.
Can
I
get
you
some
painkillers?
-
Yeah?
Okay.
Will.
Will?
Will?
It's...
It's
Lou.

I
know.

Is
there
something
Some
drugs
or
something?
I'm
just
getting
really
worried.

VOICEMAIL:
Hello.
This
is
Stephen.
Please
leave
your
name
and
number,
Hi,
Mr.
Traynor.
It's
Lou.
I'm
just...
I'm
getting
concerned
about
Will
and
I
was
Okay.
Thanks.
Bye.
ON
VOICEMAIL:
G'day.
This
is
Nathan.
WILL:
Don't
ring
Mum.
What?
We'll
be
fine,
Clark.

NATHAN:
Oi!
Sorry.
Had
to
walk
here.
Took
ages,
the
bloody
weather,
you
know.
How's
things?
Not
great.
He's
in
and
out
How
long's
he
been
like
this?
Maybe
four
or
five
hours.
I
tried
to
call.
Might
as
well
have
given
him
M&Ms.
Well,
he
said
he
just
wanted
to
sleep.
Yeah,
it's
in
the
folder,
Lou.
Will
doesn't
sweat
the
way
we
do.
If
he
gets
even
a
slight
chill,
-
Yeah,
but
he
said...
-
and
a
damp
towel,
real
quick.
Hey,
buddy.
You
all
right?
Will?
You
all
right?
I
got
you,
mate.
Come
on.
Come
on.
Yeah.
Here.
Hey,
focus.
Lou,
you
gotta

Sorry.
He's
going
to
be
okay.

RUPERT:
So,
Will,
any
final
thoughts,
bro?
I'm
thinking
you
should
be
next,
mate.
RUPERT:
Yeah,
right!

RUPERT:
We're
all
thinking
it.
Is
there
really
nothing
he
can't
do?
-
Do
we
hate
him?
Yes.
RUPERT:
But
there's
no
point
RUPERT

FREDDIE:

Ah,
stop!
WILL:
You're
watching
Wi-Fi

not
strong
enough.
What
time
is
it?
Where's...
Where's
Nathan?
Half
eight.
He
had
to
Snow
got
pretty
bad.
Shouldn't
you
be
at
home?
You're
stuck
with
me.
Will,
can
I
ask
you
something?
I
suspect
you're
going
to.
What
happened?
My
mother
didn't
tell
you?
Some
sort
of
traffic
accident...
-
Motorbike.
Actually,
I
wasn't.
The
bike
hit
me.
Sorry.
Sorry,
I'm
being
chatty
again,
and
you
need
to
rest.
No.
Stay.
Tell
me...
Tell
me
something
good.
I
used
to
say
that
to
my
dad.
But
if
I
told
you
what
he
said
back,
Oh,
that
ship
has
sailed,
Clark.
When
I
had
a
nightmare
or
Go
on.
He
used
to
sing
the
Molahonkey
song.
-
The
what?
I
thought
everyone
knew
it.
Trust
me,
Clark.
I'm
a
Molahonkey
virgin.
You're
gonna
make
me
sing
it
now?



You're
insane.
Your
whole
family
is
insane.
And
you're
a
God-awful
singer.
I
hope
your
dad
was
better.
I
think
what
you
mean
to
say
is,
"Thank
you,
Okay,
Clark.
Tell
me
something
else.
Something
that
doesn't
involve
singing.
About
what?
Anything.
Well...
When
I
was
little,
my
mum
got
me
a
pair
of
glittery
wellies,
and
I
refused
to
take
them
off.
I
wore
them
in
bed,
in
the
bath,
My
favorite
outfit
was
the
glittery
boots
Bumblebee
tights?
-
Black
and
yellow
stripes.
I
just...
I
really,
really,
really
So
what
happened
to
these
gorgeous
wellies
Ah!
I
outgrew
them.
It
broke
my
heart.
And
they
don't
make
those
tights
anymore.
Not
for
grown
women,
anyway.
Strange,
that.
Oh,
you
can
mock.
Didn't
you
Yes.
Yes,
I
did.
WILL:
Interesting
choice
of
footwear.
Patrick
says
they
make
me
look
He
was
being
nice.
-
Don't
smile
at
me
like
that.
Because
I
don't
know
what
it
means.
Where
did
you
pick
up
your
exotic
tastes?
-
What
do
you
mean
by
that?
Why
not?
Because
this
is
the
kind
of
when
they've
got
tired
of
actually
living.
People
here
think
excitement
is
a
new
"Please
be
quiet"
sign

You
should
be
out
there,
Showing
your
leprechaun
shoes
-
I
like
my
life.
-
I'm
happy
here.
Oh,
you
want
me
to
be
more
Go
to
London,
marry
somebody
like
Rupert.
I
believe
he's
taken.
And
ignore
the
fact
that
he's
shagging
And
bitch
about
him
at
dinner
parties,
knowing
he
won't
leave
because
And
have
sex
once
every
six
weeks,
and
listen
to
him
going
on
and
on
about
while
doing
nothing
And
have
perfect
hair,
through
never
saying
And
develop
an
insane
Pilates
habit,
and
develop
a
crush
And
watch
your
husband
take
up
jogging
And
know
that
every
day,
and
looks
at
the
young
men,
And
leave
him
anyway,
and
come
back
here
Whoa!
There
were
a
lot
of
divorce
Sorry.
How
did
you
end
up
in
that
café?
Treena
made
a
bet
I
proved
her
wrong.
And
stayed
there
six
years.
Way
to
go!
I
was
supposed
to
leave.
I
had
a
place
at
Manchester.
What
were
you
going
to
study?
Fashion.
Mmm.
So,
why
didn't
you
go?
You
know
what
I
see
when
I
look
at
you?
-
Don't
say
"potential."
You
need
to
widen
your
horizons,
Clark.
You
only
get
one
life.
It's
actually
your
duty
Well,
you
need
a
shave!
If
that
beard
gets
any
longer,
And
then
I'll
have
to
sue
you
-
You're
changing
the
subject.
I
am.
Fine.
I'll
let
you.
You're
really
going
to
do
this?
I'm,
uh...
I'm
really
gonna
do
this.
My
mother's
gonna
be
so
happy.
Yes,
well,
we
won't
let
that
put
us
off.

You've
got
a
funny
look
on
your
face.

Please
don't
tell
me
Only
the
one.

CAMILLA:
Freedom?
You
call
this
freedom?
STEPHEN:
We
all
agreed
to
it.
Not
the
specifics.
Jesus!
If
I
hadn't
noticed
the
Swiss
postmark...
We
made
an
agreement
with
Will.
Six
months.
No.
I
only
agreed
so
that
we
I
cannot
believe
that
you
are
willing
STEPHEN:
I'd
rather
that
than
It
wasn't
a
cry
for
help,
Camilla.
He
meant
it.
You
know
that.
Now,
this
way
we
can
be
with
him,
-
He's
my
son!
It's
his
choice.
This
is
what
he
wants.
You
know
how
much
pain
he's
in.
He
gave
me
six
months.
We
can
still
persuade
him.
And
you
think
the
pretty
waitress
-

Now,
can
I
have
the
letter,
please?
Please.
Apparently,
the
shave
was
your
idea.
Nice
one!
It
looks
great.
COMMENTATOR
ON
TV:
Now,
-

I
need
you.
LOU:
I
know
we
need
the
money,
I'm
basically
just
on
suicide
watch.
I
am
not
going
back.
-
Yeah.
Come
on.
Say
it.
I
was
thinking
about
him.
Lou,
you
can't
leave
him.
They've
got
money,
right?
I
don't
want
their
money!
No,
not
for
you,
idiot-girl!
Look.
If
this
is
what
he
really
wants,
Make
it
special.
Ask
the
Traynors
for
a
budget
Organize,
I
don't
know,

A

sexy

Katrina
Clark!
A
bucket
list.
Show
him
how
good
this
time
can
be.
Take
him
places.
Make
him
laugh.
Bloody
hell.
But,
Treen,
what
if
that
list
What
if
it
could
make
him
change
his
mind?

CAMILLA:
Will's
barely
left
We
have
tried.
Yes,
but
we
haven't
succeeded.
that
Will
is
able
and
prepared
to
do,
Sports,
concerts.
I'd
love
to
see
him
Okay.
Okay.
Louisa,
if
you
can
get
me
a
schedule,
I'll
see
if
I
can
shift
things
STEPHEN:
No!
Let
him
do
it
for
himself.
Will
needs
to
be
allowed

There
you
go.
WILL:

Oh,
my
God!
What
have
you
come
as?
I
don't
care
what
you
think.
Even
if
you
have
got
a
new
haircut.
You
look
like
a
madwoman.
An
oddly
cheerful
madwoman.
We're
taking
Nathan
Horse
racing?
Yeah.
Nathan's
never
been.
Yeah.
It's
true.
And,
besides,
I've
got
at
eight
to

My
dad's
mate,
Jimmy,
Just
a
wild
guess,
but
you
haven't
been
LOU:
The
perfect
spot.
Look,
we're
so
lucky.
Are
you
sure?
This
is
too
soft,
LOU:
Oh,
no.
He'll
be
fine.
Right.
That's
all
right.
Yeah?
-
Ah...
Um...
-
What,
do
we
need
to?
-
LOU:
Okay.
Oh!
Shit.
Um...
Don't
worry.
It's
only
cashmere.
NATHAN:
Yeah.
He's
stuck
I
know,
it's
going
to
be
fine.
-
Oh,
excuse
me!
Hi!
-
Hi.
Sorry.
Do
you...
Would
you
be
able
to
help
us?
-
Because
we're
a
bit
stuck.
-
We're
fine.
We're
fine.
Yeah?
Would
that
be...
Very
kind.
-
Come
on,
Will.
You
okay?
Yeah!
You're
okay,
aren't
you?
There
we
go.
There
we
go.
Brilliant!
Thank
you
so
much.
-
Thank
you.
Thanks.
MAN:
No
worries!

Guys,
we're

ANNOUNCER:
Just
a
quick
recap
now...
Look,
look,
look.
There
he
is.
Don't
you
think
he
looks
like
Will?
You're
going
to
lose.
How
would
you
know
that?
His
ears
are
flat,
his
coat
is
dull,
Great.
So,
you
know
everything
No.
I
just
look,
process
information
And
that

is
Yeah,

I

Can
I
call
you
Sharon?
Yeah?
So
it's

afternoon
We

to

expensive
meal.
We
don't
want
to

Oh,
I'm
really
sorry.
You
need
a
Premier

Okay,
okay,
okay.
So
how
much
What
are
we
talking,
like,
We
don't
sell

madam.
This
is
a
restaurant.
You'll
have
to
go
to
the
ticket
office.
Louisa.
Let's
go.
LOU:
No,
no,
no.
This
is
nuts.
We've
come
all
this
way.
WILL:
Louisa.
I'm
not
hungry.

I'm
just
gonna
run
and
get
We'll
be
fine
once
we've
eaten.
Yeah.
NATHAN:

I
think
Will
wants
to
go
home.
You

what,
Sharon?
You
can
stick
your
Premier

Okay.
Okay.
Everything's
fine.

Great.
So
we're
going
to

So,
maybe
horse

But
this,
I
think
you'll
enjoy.
So
Nathan's
never
been
to
No.
I
haven't.
Will
you
please
come
with
me?
I
bought
the
tickets
a
week
ago.
You
can
say
"no."
A
wind
concerto?
I've
been
assured
There's
no
chance
of
Jay-Z?
Sadly,
his
tickets
had
just
sold
out.

Mozart
it
is,
then.
Okay.
Would
this
be
the
right
sort
of
thing
Metallica,
no.
Neil
Diamond,
possibly.
I
thought
Pat
was
training
tonight.
Oh,
no.
He
is.
He
is.
I'm
taking
Will
to
a
concert
thing.
Sorry,
you're
going
on
a
date?
It's
too
booby.
Way
too
booby.
Given
it's
a
man
for
whom
your
-
Oh,
you're
so
annoying!
You
are
so
going
on
a
date
Get
the
red
dress
out.
Really?

Kapow!

Lose
the
scarf.
The
scarf?
Why?
If
you're
going
to
wear
you
have
to
wear
it
with
confidence.
Only
you,
Will
Traynor,
would
tell
a
woman

-
Here?
-
Am
I
good?
Yep,
yep,
yep.
Yep.
-
Okay.

Is
everything
okay?
Mmm-hmm.
Actually,
no,
there's
something
Okay.
It's
a
tag.
Have
we
got
any
scissors
in
the
bag?
I
don't
know,
Clark.
Believe
it
or
not,
Um...
Okay,
hang
on.


Got
it!
We
should
just
be
grateful
Oh,
look.
They're
starting.

So
you're
not
a
classical
Hated
every
minute.
Yeah,
I
could
tell.
Especially
during
that
oboe
solo.
There
was
something
in
my
eye.
I
loved
it.
Did
you?
Yeah.
Right,
we'd
better
get
you
in.
Wait
a
minute,
Clark.
You
okay?
I
don't...
I
don't
want
to
go
in
yet.
I
just
want
to
be
a
man
who
has
been
Just
a
few
minutes
more.

So,
um...
Running
man?
Why?
I
think
he
wants
to
know
who
I'm
spending
My
parents
do,
too.
I
get
nervous
when
a
girl
They
wanted
me
to
invite
you
to
But
don't
worry,
I
said
Why?
Because
you
hate
strangers
and
you
Seemed
pretty
obvious.
I'll
come.
If
you
want
me
to.
BERNARD:
Ah!
Lads,
welcome.
Bernard
Clark.
Oh,
I'm
sorry.

I
didn't...
A
curtsy
will
be
fine.

Curtsy.
Nice
one.
-
This
is
Josie.
My
wife.
-
Come
on
in.
WILL:
Thank
you.
Listen,
have
fun.
-
Thank
you!
Dear
Lord,
thank
you
for
the
food
we
eat,
Thank
you
for
the
and
the
strength
to
face
the
challenges
Amen.
ALL:
Amen.
BERNARD:
So,
Will.
You
bought
and
sold
companies?
Something
like
that.
Would
you
know
this
fella,
The
one
who...
What
is
it?
Asset
stripped
our
firm?
I'm
afraid
I
trained
him.
-
Hmm.
Oh,
well...
That's
the
door.
Some
chicken,
love?

Six
miles
in
28
minutes.
And
a
happy
birthday
to
my
girlfriend!
Yes!
Happy
birthday!
-
Sorry
I'm
a
bit
late.
Only
28
minutes.
So
couldn't
you
go
back
to
it,
Will?
I
mean,
clearly
you're
-
Dad!
Truth
is,
I
thought
I
could
as
if
nothing
had
changed.
Uh,
I
was
wrong.

This
is
delicious,
Mrs.
Clark.
Oh!
Josie,
please!
Well,
we
wanted
to
make
today
special.
Wish
Treena
could
have
been
here.
She's
the
brains
of
the
family.
She
got
put
up
two
years
at
school,
Overtook
our
Lou.
BERNARD:
Not
bright
enough
to
stop
herself
Pat,
shall
I
help
you
So,
Patrick,
Louisa
tells
me
Um,
life
coaching,
Local
young
entrepreneur
of
the
year,
Lou
tells
me
you
were
Pat.
I
bet
if
we
got
you
on
There's
actually
a
Swedish
study
about
Patrick!
What?
I'm
just
trying
to...
Yeah,
well,
don't.
I'll
bear
it
in
mind.
Thank
you.




Um,
so,
I
just
wanted
to
say
And,
um...
I
don't
know
what
we
would
Aw,
Dad.
And,
Will,
thank
you
for
employing
her.
-
Someone
had
to.
Pleasure's
all
mine.
Really.
-
Oh!
It's
not
much,
but...
Granddad
saw
something
on
TV

Aw!
Granddad,
thank
you.
Thank
you.

I
love
it.
Mum,
thank
you.
Thank
you.
Mine
next.
Oh!

Go
on,
open
it.
-
I
had
it
made
specially.
Thank
you,
Patrick.
Oh!
BERNARD:
Oh,
wow.
There's
something
for
you
You
got
Lou
a
present?
Wasn't
that
kind,
Bernard?
That's
very
kind.
Okay.
Oh!

It's
very
lovely.
Oh!

Oh,
my
God!
I
don't
believe
it!
-
What?
It's
a
secret.
Tights?
Only
the
best
pair
of
tights,
ever!
Oh,
I'm
gonna
go
try
them
on.
I'm
gonna
go
try
them
on!
-

I
can't
tell
you
how
much
I
love
them.
Really!
Thank
you.

I
put
some
cake
in
your
bag.
Thank
you,
Josie.
It's
good
to
meet
you
all.
And,
Patrick,
thank
you
for
the
fitness
advice.
Just
helping
my
girlfriend
Oh,
you're
a
lucky
man.
She
certainly
gives
a
good
bed
bath.

BERNARD:
Funny
guy.
I
like
him.
So,
I
could
take
you
It's
happening
today
and
tomorrow.
Or
there's
a
sculpture
park
Or
there's...
Ooh,
there's
wine
tasting.
This
came.
LOU:
Ah.
Can
I
take
you
somewhere?
WILL:
First
kiss
I
ever
had
Probably
didn't
hurt
Maybe
I
should
have
told
her.
She
dumped
me
a
week
later
for
a
boy

You're
never
gonna
fit
through
there.
LOU:
Oh,
wow.
It's
amazing!
Will?
Will!
No,
please!
Will,
stop!
Are
you
coming?

This
is
a
very
bad
idea.
It's
very
dangerous.
It's
very,
very
high
up.

-
And
windy.
When
I
was
a
kid,
this
used
to
in
the
whole
world.

Did
you
walk
around
up
here
Even
nicked
a
sword
Weighed
a
ton.
I
think
this
would
still
be
-
That's
because
you
haven't
been
anywhere.
So
where's
better
than
this,
then?
Val
d'lsère?
Paris.
Place
Dauphine,
right
by
the
Pont
Neuf.
Sitting
outside
a
café
and
a
warm
croissant
So,
let's
go!
We
could
get
on
-
No.
You
don't
get
it,
Clark.
I
want
to
be
in
Paris
as
me.
The
old
me.
With
pretty
French
girls
Could
be
something
to
look
forward
to.
If
I
shut
my
eyes
now,
I
know
exactly
how
it
feels
I
remember
every
sensation.
I
don't
want
those
memories
erased
the
taxi
drivers
who
refuse
to
take
me,
and
my
wheelchair
power
pack
I'll
tell
you
where
we
will
go,
though.
Where?
Alicia's
wedding.
Really?
Will
you
come
with
me?
If
you
want
me
to.
-

-
Whoo!
Jesus,
Mum,
hello!
Oh,
sod
it.
I
don't
care.
BERNARD:
We
are
celebrating,
Lou.
-
I've
got
a
job!
Dad,
that
is
fantastic!
You
are
looking
at
the
new
-
God,
that's
just...
Mr.
Traynor
rang
me
himself.
So
I'm
starting
tomorrow
Isn't
it
brilliant?
It's
good
money,
Lou.
-
And
he
gets
his
own
van.
See
you.
Okay.
I
thought
you'd
be
pleased.
LOU
ON
PHONE:
No,
I
am!
I
am
pleased.
I
just...
I
don't
know.
I
feel
weird.

Well,
don't.
Your
dad
needed
a
job,
Yeah,
but
it's
just
the
timing.
It's
just
a
bit...
It's
good.
Your
dad
will
be
great.
And
it
means...
It
means
what?
WILL:
It
means...
It
means
that
one
day
without
worrying
about
everyone
else.
Put
yourself
first,
for
once.

Hello.
Michael
Lawler.
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
You've
got
the
wrong
door.
-
He
lives...
How
was
traffic,
Michael?
Oh,
you
know.
Once
you're
out
of
London...
WILL:
We'll
sit
in
the
courtyard.
You
can
leave
us.
Thanks,
Clark.
How
have
you
been?
Oh,
well,
thank
you.
I
thought
he
seemed
happier.
Me,
too.
Well,
thank
you
for
telling
me.
-
Louisa.
You
will
look
after
him

LOU:
I
still
don't
know
WILL:
We're
going
to
behave
admirably.
Just
so
you
know,
I
will
drive
home
and
leave
you
stuck
here

Spoilsport.


FREDDIE:
Ah!
Will,
hi.
It's,
uh...
It's
so
good
to
see
you
again.
The
office
isn't
the
same
without
you.
One
minute
you
were
there
and
the
next,
well,
-
It's
kind
of
you
to
say
so,
Freddie.
Ah,
oh...
Louisa
Clark,
Freddie
Foster.
Yes!
Yes,
I
saw
you
at
the
church.
Life
isn't
all
bad
then,
eh?
Will.I.Am.

Anyway,
anyway,
must
mingle.
It's
good
to
see
you,
Will.
And
you,
Miss
Clark.
He's
a
nice
guy.
He
fancies
you.

He
needs
glasses.
Don't
do
that.
You
look
beautiful.
Well,
you
don't
look
so
shabby
yourself.

Ladies
and
gentlemen.
I
give
you
the
bride
and
groom,


MARY:
Oh,
God!
There
ought
to
be
a
law
Bride
or
groom?
Oh,
neither.
You?
Godmother
to
the
bride.
Which
makes
me
morally
Not
one
of
my
finer
acts.
Oh,
you
don't
think
much
of
her,
then?
This
is
a
bit
depressing.
Mmm.
Still,
one
can't
do
these
things
sober.
Oh,
no,
wait,
Absolutely,
darling.
And
I
firmly
encourage
you
I
hear
rumors
that
the
father
of
the
bride
-
is
going
to
inflict
another
speech
on
us.
Oh,
no.
I'm
supposed
to
be
Ah,
yes.
Young
Will.
He
was
her
chance,
you
know.
Only
one
of
that
lot
Terrible
shame.
Well,
he's
not
dead.
No,
I
meant
for
her,
not
him.
No,
Rupert's
an
arsehole.
You
take
care
of
him.
He's
a
good
one.
Take
it
from
one
who
knows.


Thank
you
so
much
for
coming,
Will.
It
was
a
lovely
day.
I
wouldn't
have
missed
it
for
the
world.
You
remember
Louisa?
ALICIA:
Oh,
yes.
Yes.
Anyway,
you're
a
real
star
for
being
here.
And
thank
you
for
the,
um...
-
For
the...
Yes,
the
mirror.
Anyway,
thank
you.
You
didn't
buy
her
a
mirror.
-
I
know.
Okay,
you.
And,
what
do
you
say?
What?
How
many
of
those
did
you
drink?
Come
on,
let's
give
these
tossers
-
All
right.
-

-
He's
ruining
everything.
WILL:
Are
they
all
appalled?

Yes.
Yeah.
Move
closer.
You
smell
fantastic.
You
never
would've
let
those
breasts
Oh,
yeah?
Well,
you
never
would've
been
if
you
hadn't
been
in
a
wheelchair.
What?
Of
course,
I
would.
No,
you
wouldn't.
You
would've
been
too
busy
The
ones
who
can
smell
And,
anyway,
I
would've
been
One
of
the
invisibles.
Am
I
right?
-
Yes,
but
in
my
defense...
I
was
an
arse.
Yep.
Do
you
know
something,
Clark?
You
are
pretty
much
the
only
thing
that
Then
let's
go
somewhere.
Anywhere
in
the
world.
Just
you
and
me.
What
do
you
say?

Say
yes,
Will.
Go
on.
-
Okay.
All
the
way
to
the
hotel.
This
is
going
to
go
very
wrong.
No,
this
is
going
to
be
brilliant!
-

I
don't
think
you're
driving

CAMILLA:
Why
didn't
you
return
I
was
worried
sick.
Are
you
all
right?
I
think
I'm
old
enough
to
spend
a
night
in
Okay.
Right.
I'm
guessing
she
didn't
do
your
tubes.
She
did
manage
to
get
the
This
is
not
good,
mate.
You're
sweating.
Look
at
me.
How's
your
eyesight?
I'm
pretty
sure
you're
Nathan.
Am
I
right?
Yeah,
I'm
pretty
sure
you've
I'll
be
fine.

Jesus,
Will.
We
had
a
nice
time.
You
what?
I'm
not
coming
to
To
Norway.
They
need
me
at
work!
But
you
said
you'd
support
me.
I
am
supporting
you,
Patrick!
I
hate
cycling,
and
you
know
I
do.

But
there's
this
trip
Why
can't
they
just
get
an
agency
nurse?
Because
it's
my
job!
-

Your
job
seems
to
take
priority
Patrick,
this
is
important,
okay?
But
it's
Norway!
It's
meant
to
be
our
holiday!
I
just
can't.

Oh,
Pat.

He's
stable.

But
pneumonia?
He
only
had
a
cough
on
Saturday
morning.
His
lungs
are
weak,
Can
I
go
in?
Oh,
Camilla's
with
him.
Best
leave
her
to
it.
It's
his
fourth
bout
in
two
years.
The
last
one
nearly
killed
him.
Thank
you.
How's
he
doing?
He's
a
little
better,
I
think.
Would
you
like
me
to
I
would
really
like
to
change
my
clothes.
Sure.
Hey.
How
are
you
feeling?
Been
better.
Oh,
I
don't
know.
You'll
do
anything
I
don't
think
I
can
do
witty
today,
Clark.

Hey,
just
dropping
off
-
some
meds
for
when
he
gets
back.
You
all
right?
Yeah,
yeah.

You
know,
don't
you?
Yeah.
Oh,
I've
been
with
him
two
years.
His
life
is
hard.
He
hides
his
pain
when
he's
with
you.
But
there
have
been
times
when
I've
In
his
dreams,
he's
still
doing
things,
you
know.
And
then
he
wakes
up
Now,
I
can't
judge
what
he
wants
to
do.
That's
his
choice.
But
that
was
before
me.
Yeah,
and
I
know
that
he
did
pretty
much
Look,
I
want
him
to
live,
Lou.
But
only
if
he
wants
to
live.
I
can't
just
let
this
happen.
I
can't.
And
we're
running
out
of
time.
So,
if
I
could
come
up
with
another
trip
would
you
come
with
us?
Yeah.
Of
course
I
would.
Hi.
This
is
unexpected.
I've
bought
your
parents
cinema
tickets
and
Granddad's
in
his
room.
You
bribed
my
parents
Good.
I
am
an
idiot.
But
this
job
of
yours
Things
will
soon
be
back
to
normal.
I
should
be
proud
that
you're
I
don't
want
to
argue
with
you,
Lou.
-
Less
than
300
calories.
What's
this?
Oh,
it's
the
trip
I
told
you
about.
I
thought
you
meant
Lourdes
or
something.
"Hot
tub
under
the
stars."
"Massages.
Swim
with
dolphins."
Oh,
look.
"Five-star
luxury,
This
isn't
work.
Do
you
really
expect
me
to
just
sit
here
while
you
swan
off
with
His
other
caregiver's
coming,
too.
Oh,
two
guys.
That's
all
right,
then.
Patrick,
this
is
really
important.
Do
you
know
how
this
feels?
It's
like
I'm
running
permanently
just
It's
like,
there's
something
and
everyone
seems
to
Patrick...
Seven
years
we've
been
together,
Lou.
You've
known
him
five
months.
But
he
needs
me.
And
I
don't?
I'm
sorry.

Well,
you
got
him
here.
-
Cheers,
mate.
WOMAN:
Bienvenue.
Let
me
show
you
to
your
rooms.
Hey,
you.
How
are
you
feeling?
Better.
So,
what's
the
plan
for
today?
Um,
well,
we
can
stay
here
for
a
bit.
Because
they
rent
DVDs
at
the
front
desk.
We
didn't
come
all
this
way
Stop,
stop.
Hey!
-
Oh!

Is
there
alcohol
in
that?
Rum,
vodka
and
Cointreau,
sir.
She'll
have
two,
please.
-
Yes,
sir.
Oh,
I
booked
you
in
Even
after
I
said
I
didn't
want
to.
Will!
-
Hey!
-
NATHAN:
Hey.
I'm
gonna
walk
Karen
back
to
her
hotel.
I'm
just
not
sure
she
should
Very
chivalrous
of
you.
Yeah,
it's
very
civic-minded.
-
Oh,
piss
off,
the
both
you.
Yeah,
I've
got
everything
We'll
be
fine.
All
right.
Yeah,
we'll
see
you
later.
-
Bye!

No,
don't.
Leave
them
open.
I
wanna
see
it.
Don't
go
back
to
your
room
tonight,
Clark.
-
WILL:
Just
do
it.
It's
gonna
be
too
deep,
so
I
can't.
You
can.
You
can
do
anything.
Mmm-mmm.
Why
didn't
you
make
me
do
that
earlier?
That
was
amazing!
WILL:
I
don't
know,
Clark!
Some
people
just
won't
be
told!



I
don't
wanna
go
home.
This
has...
This
has
been
the
best.
You're
glad
you
came,
right?
Yes.

WILL:
You.
You
are
something
else,
Clark.
Well.
I
have
to
tell
you
something.
I
know.
I
know
about
Switzerland.
I
have
known
for
months.
Listen,
I
know
this
is
not
but
I
can
make
you
happy.
-
No.
No,
Clark.
I
get
that
this
could
be
a
good
life.
But
it's
not
my
life.
It's
not
even
close.
You
never
saw
me
before.
I
loved
my
life.
I
really
loved
it.
I
can't
be
the
kind
of
man
You're
not
giving
it
a
chance.
You're
not
giving
me
a
chance.
I
have
become
a
whole
new
person
I
know.
And
that's
why
I
don't
want
you
to
miss
all
the
things
that
And
selfishly,
I
don't
want
and
feel
even
the
tiniest
bit
I
would
never
think
that!
You
don't
know
that.
I
can't
watch
you
wandering
around
the
annex
Or
see
you
naked
and
not...

Not
be
able
to
do...
Oh,
God,
Clark,
if
you
had
any
idea

I
can't
live
like
this.
Please.
Will,
please.

Listen.
This,
tonight,
being
with
you
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
But
I
need
it
to
end
here.
No
more
pain
and
exhaustion
and
waking
up
every
morning
It's
not
going
to
get
better
than
this.
The
doctors
know
it
and
I
know
it.
When
we
get
back,
So
I'm
asking
you
if
you
feel
come
with
me.

I
thought
that
Nothing
was
ever
going
to
change
my
mind.
I
promised
my
parents
six
months,
No!
No.
Don't
say
another
word.
You're
so
selfish.
I
tore
my
heart
out
in
front
of
you,
And
now
you
want
me
to
come
and
watch
the
worst
thing
Do
you
have
any
idea
what
you're
asking?
I
wish
I
had
never
taken
this
stupid
job!
I
wish
I
had
never
met
you.
-

Louisa!
You
all
right?
Fine.



Oh,
look
at
you.
-
You
look
wonderful!
Great
photos
of
you
on
the
beach.
Yeah,
it
was
great.
How
was
the
flight?
Well,
we
got
here
in
one
piece.
Are
you
hungry?
'Cause
we
can
eat
-
I
could
eat.
Louisa,
let
me
give
you
a
hand
with
those.
Actually,
I
need
to
get
home.
Come
on.
We
want
to
know
how
you
got
on.
Let
her
go.
Louisa!
Louisa!
Louisa!
Wait.
Louisa,
please.
You
don't
need
to
pay
me.
I'm
sorry.


Well?

Sit
down,
Josie,
love.
Please.
Lou's
upset
enough.
And
his
parents
know?
I
mean,
what
kind
of
people
are
they?
Mrs.
Traynor
doesn't
know
It's
his
choice.
Some
choices
you
don't
get
to
make.
He's
not
in
his
right
mind.
People
that
are
vulnerable
It's
complicated,
Mum.
-
It
is
not.
It's
simple.
No.
You
can't
be
a
part
of
this.
It's
no
better
than
murder.

I
tried,
Dad.
I
tried
so
hard,
but
I
failed.
Who
says
you
failed?

I'm
not
sure
anyone
in
the
world
could
ever
persuade
that
man,
You
can't
change
who
people
are.
Then
what
can
you
do?
You
love
them.

No
one
could
have
done
more
than
you.
You
have
a
heart
as
big
as
that
castle,
Have
you
seen
them?
Mr.
Traynor?
They
left.
This
morning.
Dad,
have
I
made
a
huge
mistake?
Call
them.
You
still
have
time.
TREENA:
Don't
worry.
Mum
will
come
round.
I'll
talk
to
her.
You're
doing
the
right
thing,
Lou.
You
have
to
go.
You
were
useless
until
you
met
him.
Hello.
Hello.
He's
just
through
there.
Okay.
Here.
Oh,
thank
you.
Thanks.

-

Sorry,
I
didn't
mean
to...
The
familiar
sound
of
Louisa
Clark

We'll
leave
you
be.
Thank
you.
Don't
tell
me.
You're
here
to
make
my
last
cup
of
tea.

Actually,
no.
I'm
here
to
kidnap
you.
I'm
gonna
steal
you
and
WILL:
Where?
-
LOU:
Rio.
LOU:
Or
my
mum
and
dad's.
Open
the
doors,
Clark.
Come
here.
Closer.
Look
at
me.
Please,
look
at
me.
I
can't.
Tough.
I
need
to
see
that
face.
I
need
to
see
that
face
of
yours.
Even
if
it
is
all
pink
and
blotchy.

You
really
are
the
most
And
the
world
will
definitely
No.
No,
it
won't.

Don't
be
sad,
Clark.
Tell
me
something
good.

Will
you
stay?
For
as
long
as
you
want
me
to.
Can
you
call
my
parents
in?
WILL:
Clark.
A
few
weeks
should
have
passed
If
you
followed
the
instructions,
on
one
of
those
chairs
that
never
sit
I
hope
it's
still
sunny.
Across
the
bridge
to
your
right
You
should
try
the
scent
I
always
did
think

There
are
a
few
things
because
you
would
have
got
all
emotional
So,
here
it
is.
When
you
get
back
home,
Michael
Lawler
that
contains
enough
Don't
start
panicking.
It's
not
enough
for
you
to
sit
around
but
it
should
buy
you
your
freedom.
At
least
from
that
little
town
Live
boldly,
Clark.
Push
yourself.
Don't
settle.
Wear
those
stripy
legs
with
pride.
Knowing
you
still
have
Knowing
I
might
have
given
them
to
you
So,
this
is
it.
You
are
scored
on
my
heart,
Clark.
You
were
from
the
first
day
you
walked
in
with
your
sweet
smile
And
your
bad
jokes
and
your
complete
inability
to
ever
hide
Don't
think
of
me
too
often.
I
don't
want
you
getting
sad.
Just
live
well.
Just
live.
I'll
be
walking
beside
you
Love,
Will.
