I'm
so
happy
you
picked
this
dress,
Veruca!
You
look
beautiful.
Doesn't
she?
You
guys,
I'm
getting
married!
I'm
getting
married!
Not
without
your
veil,
you're
not.
Where
is
that
bad
boy?
Oh,
I
think
I
left
it
upstairs.
Don't
worry.
I'll
get
it,
sis.
She
is
so
annoying.
And
so
ugly.
She
looks
like
Karl
Malden.
I
know,
and
she's
gonna
be
my
sister-in-law
in
an
hour!
COLBY:
How
are
you
gonna
deal
with
that?
VERUCA:
I'm
just
gonna
lay
down
the
law
for
Danny.
We're
seeing
his
goofy
family
as
little
as
possible.
DANA:
You
sure
he's
gonna
go
along
with
that?
VERUCA:

Danny
doesn't
say
no
to
me.
Believe
me,
I
have
him
well-trained.

So,
tell
us,
what
happened
with
Eric
last
night?

So,
I
told
him
if
he
wanted
to
stop
the
wedding,
he
had
to
speak
now
or
forever
hold
his
peace.
And
what'd
he
say?
He
said
he's
never
gonna
settle
down,
and
I
should
just
go
ahead
and
marry
Danny.

Did
he
give
you
a
wedding
present,
huh?
You're
so
horny!
Yeah.
I
guess
you
could
call
it
that.
DANA:
You're
so
bad!

It's
the
last
time,
I
swear.
Yeah,
right!
Danny
is
so
sweet
and
considerate.
And
he's
gonna
be
a
cardiologist.
So,
I'm
marrying
him
and
that
zucchini
in
the
middle
of
his
face.
JANA:
His
parents
are
disgusting,
too!
COLBY:
Close
your
eyes
when
he's
on
top!
DANA:
And
your
thighs!
Cuz,
I'm
so
sorry.
DANNY:
Yikes,
that
hurt.
That
was
me,
Danny
Maccabee,
20
years
ago.
Pathetic,
huh?

So,
I'm
halfway
done
boozing
away
my
sorrows,
when
something
pretty
interesting
happened.
Oh,
baby,
you're
like
a
Pop
Tart,
hot
and
sweet!

Hey,
mami!
You
must
play
the
trumpet
or
something,
'cause
you're
making
me
feel
all
horny
and
stuff!
You
dropped
your
purse.
Can
I
just
sit
for
10
seconds
and
not
get
hit
on?
Thank
you.
I
was
just
letting
you
know
you
dropped
your
purse.

I'm
sorry.
I
thought...
That's
fine,
that's
fine.
I'm
sure
you
didn't
meet
the
in
a
meat
market
like
this.
School
cafeteria.
How
long
you
been
married?
DANNY:
I
was
gonna
tell
her,
I
really
was.
But
I
didn't
want
her
to
know
what
a
loser
I
was,
so
I
stretched
the
truth
a
little.
Six
years.
Where's
your
wife
tonight?
I
stopped
asking
that
question
a
long
time
ago.
That's
terrible.
My
wife
says
I
work
too
much.
Trying
to
provide
for
her,
her
shopping
addiction,
and
crack.
Why
don't
you
just
leave
her?
The
children.
All
14
of
them.
I
just,
I
like
to
adopt,
and
I
don't
wanna
stop
doing
that.
You
poor
guy.
You
wanna
get
outta
here?
DANNY:
And
so
I
discovered
the
power
of
the
wedding
ring.
The
symbol
of
my
humiliation
had
become
a
tool
to
get
back
on
the
horse.
Are
you
kidding
me?
Snuffleupagus!
I
switched
my
specialty
from
got
rid
of
the
big
honker,
and
the
ring
became
my
thing.
I
just
assumed
after
we
got
married
You
need
to
put
this
wedding
band
on
a
true
heart.
This
is
a
good
moment.
Yeah.
Should
we
go
make
it
last,
for
a
while,
somewhere?
Okay,
let's
go.
To
your
dorm.
DANNY:
Sometimes
I
think
about
throwing
the
ring
into
the
ocean.
I
know
how
wrong
it
is.
But
I
can't.

It's
my
Precious.
Besides,
being
fake
married
is
the
perfect
way
to
make
sure
I
never
get
my
heart
broken
again.
What
are
these?

Boobie
bags.
The
women,
they
stick
them
in
their
flat
chesties,
make
them
big.
These
are
not
the
boobie
bags
that
I
ordered.
What
is
that?
It's
like
a
syrup
dispenser
at
an
IHOP.
I
don't
know
what
that
is.
Come
on.
These,
they
don't
feel
like
these.
No...
Seriously?
I
just
trying
to
learn.
Listen,
Dr.
Maccabee
would
Would
you
please
just
get
me
what
I
ordered
and
tell
Omar
that
I
would
like
a
Yes,
ma'am.
Thank
you,
Simon.
My
4:00
here?
KATHERINE:
Yeah.
Room
one,
Kirsten
Brant.
Don't
laugh.

Well,
I,
uh...
I
had
bad
plastic
surgery.
Should've
known
this
doctor
was
a
quack.
His
office
was
in,
like,
a
warehouse.
I
see,
I
see.
Questions?
No,
no.
Just,
please
help
me,
Doctor.
Absolutely.
It's
usually
easier
to
do
these
things
right
the
first
time,
but...
What?
You
seem
dubious.
Hmm?
Oh,
no,
not
at
all.
I
mean,
I
hear
you're
the
best,
Dr.
Maccabee.
I
don't
know
about
that,
but
I
think
we
can
figure
something
out
here.
Relax,
relax.
That's
relaxed?
Hmm.
Here,
let
me
just
pull
it
down
for
a
sec.
And
I
let
go.
Okay,
shoots
right
I'm
sorry.
Oh.
Sorry
about
what?
Oh,
my
God!
It's
just...
That
just
really
went
right
up
there.
That
was
high.
You
gotta
watch
that.
It's
gonna
get
caught
in
your
hair.
I
don't
know,
maybe
I
should
just
keep
it
like
this.
It
seems
to
make
other
people
happy.
No.
But,
seriously,
are
you
available

DANNY:
That's
too
much.
I'm
sorry!
Let
me
give
you
a
hug.
That's
what
you
need
first.
We'll
fix
this.
Mmm.
Oh,
God!
Okay,
I
gotta...
I'm
gonna
excuse
myself.
I'm
sorry.
Ding-dong!
Eddie's
here.
Hey.
My
cousin.
Oh.
Oh,
my
gosh.
Brows
gone
wild
over
here.
I'm
actually
digging
it.
And
what
are
you
doing
later?

Oh!
Oh,
sorry,
I'm
kind
of
seeing
Oh,
browch.

My
gosh.
Look,
I
don't
know
who
you're
seeing,
but
whoever
they
are,
they
don't
have
what
this
guy's
got
down
All
right,
Eddie.
Yeah,
it's
a
very
good
one.
I
should
know,
I
installed
it.
Oh,
you
had
a
penile
enlargement?
Yes.
People
really
do
that?
That
is
hilarious!
See
you
on
the
28th,
Dr.
Maccabee!
Dude,
why
are
you
telling
everybody
Am
I
hiding
the
secrets
around
here?
You
don't
think
Katherine
knows
about
this?
Katherine
was
in
the
room
when
I
did
that.
She
held
the
magnifying
glass.
I
did.
And
the
tweezer.
Real
nice.
Did
you
get
a
chance
to
try
it
out
yet?
Uh,
yeah.
I've
banged
it
up.
It's
got
a
couple
dents.
I'm
not
gonna
lie.
Yeah.
You
did?
Not
from
a
human.
It's
got...
From
this
doll
I
made.
Oh.

Hey,
Adon.
Yo,
yo.
Danny!
I
am
so
happy
you
could
be
here!
How
are
you,
baby?
Did
you
bring
any
Botox?
I
didn't
bring
the
Botox.
I
brought
my
cousin,
Eddie.
Nice
to
meet
you,
Eddie.
Is
this
a
Halloween
party?
Are
you
kidding
me
right
now?
You
got
a
little
more
work
done,
huh?
Yeah,
just
a
little
bit,
just
tweaking,
tweaking.
Maintenance,
maintenance.
I
just
wanna
stay
in
the
game,
Danny.
I
don't
wanna
hit
home
runs,
You
gotta
stop,
though,
I'm
telling
you.
Do
you
have
any
feeling
in
your
face?
Just
in
this
one
spot
right
here.
And
then
from
the
eyebrows
down,
dead,
dead.

Is
that
a
car
alarm?
He's
laughing,
he's
laughing.
Oh,
okay.
I
wanted
to
go
to
your
cousin
Danny
here,
but
he
refused
to
do
any
work.
He
didn't
wanna
put
his
fingers
in
the
pie.
Ooh!
It
was
getting
dangerous.
This
amount...
You
gotta
slow
it
down.
Okay,
see?
That
shouldn't
be
happening
right
now.
Adon!
Adon,
Adon,
Adon!
Ariel
cut
open
his
knee.
It
looks
awful.
What
happened?
Settle,
settle.
What
do
you
expect
me
to
do
about
it?
It's
bleeding.
You
know
what?
I
could
stitch
him
up.
Why
don't
you
go
get
me
my
bag?
All
right.
So,
you
fell
down
the
stairs,
huh?
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.
Did
you
trip
over
something?
Was
there
a
skateboard
there,
or...
No,
I
was
distracted
by
something.
What
distracted
you?
A
girl.
A
girl,
okay.
Was
it
your
mother?
No!
'Cause
she
just
looks
good.
That's
your
stepmom.
I
can
talk
like
that.
All
right.
This
is
lidocaine.
Don't
think
about
it.

Ow!
Don't
think
about
it.
Think
about
your
face.
Good,
good.
Blonde,
brunette,
redhead?
Blonde,
tan,
tall,
rocking
body.
Nipples.
Want
me
to
numb
something
else
for
you?
You're
getting
a
little
nutty
over
there.

No!
No,
I'm
good.
I'm
good.
I'm
alive!
I'm
alive,
everybody!
Good
job,
Doctor.
That
was
really
nice.
The
distraction,
I'm
guessing.
The
what?
The
boy
was
distracted.
That's
why
he
fell.
So,
I'm
taking
the
rap
for
this.
Yes.
Your
hotness
basically
pushed
Good
luck
proving
that
in
court,
Wisengruber.
Wisengruber?
Is
that
what
they're
saying
on
the
Gossip
Girl
nowadays?
I
knew
you
two
would
eventually
find
each
other!
But
be
careful,
Palmer,
these
plastic
surgeons,
they
really
know
how
to
operate.

Yeah,
all
right,
Adon.
All
right.
PALMER:
I
just
don't
know
about
plastic
surgery.
I
mean,
doesn't
it
always
look
so
fake?
Depends
who's
doing
it.
I'm
pretty
Some
of
my
patients
are
here
tonight.
Oh,
really?
Really,
really.
Look
around,
see
if
you
can
find
someone
decent-looking.
How
'bout
her?
The
lady
from
Saw?
Fine.
Who
did
you
do?
All
right.
I
hate
to
rat
the
guy
out,
but
see
that
guy
over
there?
You
mean
Sexy
Ass?
Before
I
met
him,
he
was
No
Buns
Bobby.
Really?
His
back
went
straight
to
his
legs.
No
kidding.
He'd
go
to
the
bathroom,
he'd
slide
right
in
the
toilet.
I
know,
I
know,
that's
really
romantic,
isn't
it?
So,
North
Carolina,
how
long
I've
been
here
almost
two
years.
Uh-huh.
That's
a
lot
of
auditioning
for
you.
You
think
I'm
an
actress?
I
guarantee
you're
an
actress.
Well,
guess
again,
Doc.
I
teach
sixth
grade
math.
They
got
no
schools
in
North
Carolina
to
teach
at?
My
parents
divorced.
Had
a
pretty
nasty
one,
actually,
when
I
was
in
the
eighth
grade.
Mmm-hmm.
And...
I
don't
know.
I
got
tired
of
picking
sides,
so...
Okay.
I
thought
I'd
make
a
change
You
came
to
the
right
place.
Mmm-hmm.
I've
never
hung
out
with
a
girl
your
age.
This
is
nice.
Oh,
no.
Your
first
lie
to
me.
You're
good.
All
right.
I've
never
hung
out
with
a
girl
your
age
and
connected
the
way
we
are
right
now.
Actually,
I've
never
connected
with,
I
don't
think
any
girl
at
any
age.
See?
I
can
tell
when
you're
lying
and
when
you're
telling
the
truth.
Oh.
Yeah.
The
second
thing
I
said
was
the
truth.
I
know.
Oh,
my
God.
That
was
the
greatest
night
of
my
life.
Yeah.
This
feels
like
it
could
be...
I
don't
know,
a
real
thing.
It's
a
thing
all
right,
Palmer.
Well,
I
have
to
get
to
work,
but
how
'bout
I
take
your
number
and
then
you
can
take
me
out
I
got
a
business
card
in
my
pocket
You
better
call.

You
better
not
just,
just
leave
me
hanging.
I'd
get
it
for
you
myself,
but
I
don't
want
you
to
see
me
naked
in
the
daylight.
It
could
be
a
deal
breaker.
What's
this?
A
circle?
A
wedding
ring?
You're
married?
No,
no,
no,
I'm
not,
I'm
not
married.
That
is
a...
That
is...
That's
not
mine.
Whose
wedding
ring
is
in
your
pants,
Danny?
All
right,
listen,
just
give
me
a
minute
to
explain
this.
Please.
It's
gonna
take
more
than
a
minute.
I
am
such
an
idiot!
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Don't
call
me!
No,
Palmer!

I
told
you
that
this
whole
fake
marriage
thing
was
just
gonna
come
and
bite
you
in
the
ass.
Why
don't
you
just
tell
her
the
truth?
You
think
I
can
tell
her
the
truth?
Let
me
practice.
You
be
her
right
now.
Oh,
good.
Okay,
hold
on.
Okay.
She's
not
like
that,
but
anyways.
Um,
I
wear
this
fake
wedding
ring
sometimes...
You're
a
pig.

Sorry.
You're
a
pig.
What's
wrong?
You're
walking
really
weird.
My
back.
I
slept
on
the
beach
last
night.
God
Almighty.
When
are
you
gonna
strengthen
your
spine?
Seriously,
Flomax.
You
gotta
work
out
more
than
once
a
month.
I
can't,
I
don't
have
time
to
work
out.
You
do.
You
can't
say
that,
Danny.
My
mother
always
said
Cary
Grant
Only
took
the
stairs,
every
day,
never
an
elevator.
You
wanna
hear
my
impression
Watch.
What?
Hello?
No,
he's
dead.
Okay,
bye-bye.
That's
good.
That's
funny.
Mom,
give
me
some
money.
Hi.
How
are
you?
Nice
to
see
you,
kids.
Please
be
polite
and
say
hello
to
Dr.
Maccabee.

'Ello,
Dr.
Danny.
'Ow
is
you
today?
Is
that
my
associate,
Dr.
Doolittle?
Why
is
she
talking
like
that?
She's
been
working
on
some
accents.
I
am
takin'
an
acting
class
this
summer,
I
is.
Gonna
be
the
next
Miley
Cyrus,
I
am.
How
'bout
you,
young
man?
Do
No.
I
like
Californication.
When
do
you
ever
watch
Californication?
Rosa
lets
us
watch
Showtime
Eat
the
mushroom!
Eat
the
mushroom!
Yes!
Mmm.
You
run
a
tight
ship
at
home,
huh?
MICHAEL:
Dr.
Danny?
Yeah?
Will
you
take
me
to
Hawaii
so
Take
you
to
Hawaii?
No.
I
saw
a
show
on
the
Discovery
Channel.
They
say
in
Hawaii
they
have
dolphins
that
you
can
swim
with
if
you
pay
money.
Okay.
But
I
don't
have
any
money.
And
Michael!
No,
it's
fine.
Maybe
you
should
make
your
own
money.
Maybe
a
paper
route
or
something
like
that?
'Cause
rich
people
don't
give
other
people
trips.
That's
why
they
remain
rich.
You
understand?
But
my
mom
says
you
do
charity
for
kids
all
the
time.
I
do
charity
work
like
I
fix
a
cleft
I
don't
take
them
to
Hawaii.
What
if
I
was
deformed?
Then
If
you
were
deformed,
I'd
bring
you
to
Hawaii,
but
I'd
leave
you
there,
'cause
Okay.
Here's
the
money,
and
I
want
change.
And
I
wanna
hear
back
that
you
actually
ate
the
food
that
I
am
paying
for.
Mom,
before
we
go,
can
I
make
a
Devlin?
Sure.
Down
the
hall.
Will
you
please
go
with
him?
We
open
in
five
minutes
and
I
am
Bloody
hell
right,
I
will,
Mumsy!
All
right,
Winston
Churchill.
He
said,
"I
gotta
make
a
Devlin."
What
does
that
mean?
Uh...
It's
just
a
friend
of
mine
who
named
Devlin
Adams,
and...
Well,
I
wouldn't
say
friend.
I'd
say
more
my
nemesis.
Oh,
so
she
was
a
frenemy?
Yes.
You'd
probably
like
her.
She's
really,
really
fake.
Ah.
Always
had
to
have
the
coolest
clothes
and
the
hottest
boys
and,
you
know...
She
bothers
you.
A
lot.
So,
one
night,
I
was
just
having
a
glass
of
wine.
A
bottle.
A
bottle.
And,
uh...
And
I
just
got
so
tired
of
the
kids
saying
things
like,
"I
gotta
take
a
crap.
"I
gotta
take
a
dump."
So,
I
told
them
that
it
was
called
"making
a
Devlin,"
and
they
liked
it.
And
it
stuck.
I
always
call
it
making
a
black
pickle.
Making
a
what?
I
don't
say
that.
Out
loud?
Good.
To
others.
No.
What
are
we
gonna
do
about
my
love
life,
though?
Oh,
Danny,
I
would
feel
terrible
for
you
if
I
had
any,
even
the
slightest,
investment
in
you
successfully
banging
23-year-olds.
Holy
Devlin,
you're
not
listening
to
me.
This
is
like
not
some
bull-Devlin
fling.
I
mean,
I'm
serious.
This
is
the
real
Devlin.
I
could...
I
swear
to
God,
I
could
see
myself
Oh.
You're
right.
You
can't
tell
her
the
truth.
High
score!
Oh,
God.
Sorry.
I'm
glad
someone's
doing
good.

You
know
what?
You
don't
wanna
get
serious,
'cause
when
you
get
serious,
that
leads
to
marriage,
and
then
marriage
leads
to
divorce,
I
mean,
look
at
these
poor
kids.
You
know,
their
dad
was
supposed
He
was
a
no-show?
Again.
But
you
know
what?
At
least
I
got
my
head
together
and
I
divorced
him.
Yeah,
yeah.
Wait
a
minute.

You
go
ahead
without
me.
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
Palmer,
Palmer,
Palmer,
Palmer,
Palmer.
I
told
you
I
didn't
want
to
see
you.
I
just
want
to
explain
something
to
you.
Let
me
explain
something
to
you.

I
do
not
date
married
men.
My
father
cheated
on
my
mom
when
I
was
young.
I
am
not
going
to
be
the
other
woman!
Adulterer!
Fornicator!
All
right,
take
it
easy,
Damien,
all
right?
Okay,
his
name
is
Silas,
leave
him
out
of
this.
I'll
kill
you.
What?
Anytime!
Listen!
I
am
married.
But
it
is
a
horrible
marriage.
She
doesn't
even
talk
to
me
anymore.
Danny,
that's
what
all
married
men
say.
If
it's
so
bad,
why
don't
you
get
divorced?
I
am.
You
are?
Yes!
It's
over.
Oh,
my
God,
I
can't
believe
this.
I
destroyed
a
marriage!
I
really
feel
like
I'm
gonna
be
sick.
I
can't...
No,
no,
it
wasn't
'cause
of
you!
I
filed
a
long,
long
time
ago.
We're
gonna
sign
the
papers
in
a
couple
of
days
and
it's
like,
she's
dead
to
me.
What's
her
name?
Mrs.
Maccabee.
You
mean
her
first
name?
Her
first
name
is
Devlin.
Her
name's
Devlin?
Isn't
that
a
shitty
name?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
But
Devlin
and
I
are
splitting
up,
fortunately,
'cause
I
caught
her
cheating
on
me
with
another
guy.
I
didn't
catch
her.
The
television
show
Cheaters
caught
her
and
the
guy.
And
I
told
them
not
to
air
it,
though,
because
it's
too
painful.
They
actually
burned
the
tape
so
you
can't
see
it.
But
I
would
love
you
to.
There's
another
man?
There's
another
guy,
yes.
Dolph.
Dolph?
Dolph
Lundgren.
Yeah.
Like
the
guy
from
Rocky
IV?
No,
no,
a
different
Dolph
Lundgren.
Apparently,
if
you
bring
that
one
up,
this
one
gets
really
angry,
so
don't.
Danny,
guys
always
say
they're
They
never
do.
I'm
telling
you,
she's
happy
with
this
Dolph
guy,
good
for
her.
Now
I
wanna
be
happy.
And
the
only
way
I
can
be
happy
is
if
I'm
with
you!
All
right?
Just
wanna
be
able
to
be
with
you
and
not
be
called
a
"fornicator"
or
an
"adulterer"
or
whatever
that
Children
of
the
Corn
kid
was
calling
me.
Okay.
Okay?
I
just
need
to
hear
it
from
her.
How
about
if
she
texts
you,
would
that
be
good?
I
need
to
meet
her.
Let's
do
it.
KATHERINE:
You
want
me
to
be
And
you
couldn't
think
of
another
I
practically
took
a
Devlin
in
my
"What's
her
name?"
I
got
panicked.
I
get
nervous
around
this
girl.
You
got
panicked?
You
who
invents
a
fake
wife
every
Friday
night?
Yeah.
Doesn't
that
say
something
about
what
I
feel
about
this
girl?
Have
you
ever
thought
about
the
time
that
she's
actually
gonna
walk
...and
sees
that
I'm
your
assistantlreceptionist?
So
easy.
I'm
a
plastic
surgeon,
you
will
never
look
like
you
again.
Snip,
snap.
Chip,
chap.
What
are
you
talking
about?
I'm
kidding.
I'll
get
you
a
fake
mustache.
Oh,
my
God,
you've
really,
really
Will
you
please
just
look
at
some
clothes?
Look
at
that.
I
don't
wear...
I
have
clothes,
by
the
way.
I
do
not
need
to
do
any
of
this.
I'm
fine.
Yes.
You
have
the
best
clothes
that
Old
Navy
sells.
I'm
just
saying
you
gotta
look
I
want
to
create
the
illusion
I
had
a
hot
first
wife.
You're
so...
Not
this!
Okay,
come
on,
let's
go,
you
asked
for
it.
I'm
ready.
Wow!
These
are...
Oh,
geez.
Nice,
nice.
It's
just
been
a
while
since
I've
been
in
heels,
sorry.
Okay,
okay.
Oh,
gosh.
Okay.
Get
there.
Yeah,
great.
Oh,
my
God!
These
are
gorgeous!
How
much
are
these?
$1,700.
$1,700?
What,
do
you
come
with
them?
My
parents'
house
costs
$1,700.
No,
no.
No.
What,
did
Mickey
Mantle
sign
those?
Why
are
they
$1,700,
they
made
outta
panda?
Walk
away.
Yeah.
You
know
what?
We
won't
really
be
needing
them
anyway.
'Cause
I'm
actually
starting
to...
I'm
actually
starting
to
feel
not
Whoo.
I'm
not
sure
I'll
be
able
to
make
it
this
evening.
Very
good.
Okay,
you
know
what?
We'll
take
them.
It's
your
Christmas
bonus.
Oh,
really?
Okay,
then
I
would
like
them
in
blue,
too.
In
case
a
heel
breaks
or
I
just
want
to
cuddle.
It's
beautiful.
You
sicken
me.
Yes,
well,
that's
why
we're
getting
a
divorce.
We're
getting
a
divorce
because
you're

Actually,
I
think
you
need
to
Yeah,
I
think
I
should.
Mmm.
Thank
you,
Laurie.
I
agree.
All
the
girls
are
sticking
together.
Isn't
that
sweet?
Mmm-hmm.
She's
on
your
side,
what
a
shock.
You
asked
for
this.
Trust
me.
Uh-huh.
You
asked
for
this.


No.
No.
Hell,
no!
No,
no,
no!
What
do
you
mean,
no?
No?
No
what?
No
hope.
Okay?
There's
only
one
word
for
it.
What
is
it?
Neglect.
Okay?
This
is
the
one
word
for
the
whole
thing.
Are
you
the
husband?
I'm
the
soon
to
be
ex-husband.
We're
getting
a
divorce.
Well,
you
know
he's
not
divorcing
you.
He's
divorcing
your
head.
True
'dat,
Ernesto.
Right
on
the
money.
Your
hair
is
so
messed
up,
I
don't
even...
Let
me
count
the
ways.
It's
dull,
it's
dead,
it's
flat.
Don't
forget
smelly.
It
don't
smell,
particularly...
Okay,
I
think
we
got
it.
You
bad.
You
is
bad.
Give
me
a
little
bit.
That's
bad,
though.
You
guys,
come
on,
seriously.
do
something,
so
we
can
be
home
and
I
can
get
out
of
here?
Hurricane
Katrina
could
do
something,
baby.
I'm
gonna
do
something
transcendent.
Katya!
Yuri,
Mrs.
Hwiggins!
We
going
in
deep,
y'all.
You
seem
nervous,
Danny.
No,
no,
I
just...
It's
weird,
she
gets
me
very
tense.
I'm
sorry
to
put
you
through
this.
No,
I
understand
why
we're
doing
this.
I'm
just
looking
forward
to
getting
and
moving
on
to
the
good
part.
We
will.
Soon.
Tonight.
Good
God,
yes.

Is
that
her?
I
think
so.
She's
stunning.
I
love
her
shoes.
Yeah,
well,
she
got
about
five
pairs
of
them.
Maybe
she'll
give
you
one.
Henderson!
Do
you
see
Dr.
Maccabee
anywhere
in
this...
Oh!
There
he
is.
Keep
the
car
running,
shan't
be
long.
Hello,
boring!
Hey.
You
went
with
a
limo
driver?
I'm
just
playing
the
part.
Okay.
Palmer!
Hi.
Devlin
Maccabee.
Soon
to
be,
single-abee.
Waiter!
Excuse
me.
Anybody?
Yes,
yes.
Something
to
drink,
madam?
Well,
hello.
I
would
like
a
tall
glass
of
you.
Is
that
possible?
Meow!
I'm
just
kidding.
Unless
you're
really
into
it.
Kidding
again.
No,
I'm
not.
We
don't
know.
Grey
Goose
martinis,
just
keep
'em
coming.
Okay.
Ooh!
Make
that
a
dirty
martini.
Okay?
Okay,
that
was
a
good
one.
Well,
so,
Palmer.
I
heard
you
and
Danny
had
sex.
Yes.
I
am
so
sorry,
I
had...
Please,
honey,
it
is
fine.
I'm
just
happy
to
hear
that
his
thing-a-ding
'Cause
he's
got
a
serious
small
issue
with
ED.
Over
here.
Okay.
What's
ED?
I
don't...
Oh,
gosh.
I
forgot.
You're
fifteen.
Erectile
dysfunction,
my
darling.
Think
about
it
as
if
you're
trying
to
throw
darts
and
you
just...
All
you
really
got,
you're
shooting
with,
like,
overcooked
spaghetti.
Okay.
Yeah.
I
just
think
that
my
spaghetti
wasn't
loving
the
meatballs
that
was
being
served.
They
were
a
little
too
lumpy.
Oh.
I've
heard
from
a
lot
of
men
that
I
serve
the
finest
meatballs
in
Southern
California.
Of
course.
A
lot
of
homeless
men
have
said
this.
They'll
eat
anything,
you
know.
I'm
just
very
shocked
that
you
remember
anybody
you've
ever
been
with.
With
all
the
pills
that
are
in
your
system.
She
likes
the
pills,
this
one.
At
night
I
come
home,
"What's
for
dinner?"
"Well,
we
have
purple
pills,
and
the
green
ones
"and
some
lovely
yellow
bombers
"I
just
took
out
of
the
oven."
Remember
that?
I
had
to
do
something
to
amuse
myself
while
this
one
sat
on
the
throne
for
hours
dealing
with
his
irritable
bowel
syndrome.
I
got
another
disease.
Okay.
Can
I
tell
you,
I
spent
the
eve
of
our
wedding
sitting
on
the
bed,
listening
to
what
sounded
like
of
French
horns
and
bassoons
coming
out
of
our
hotel
bathroom.
Mix
that
with
the
smell
of
like
and
you've
got
what
you
call
yourself
a
severely
diminished
libido.

Ow!
Did
you
just
kick
me?
No.
Did
you?
You
kicked
her?
Why'd
you
kick
her?
Yeah,
I
don't...
I...
Yes.
I...
I
have
leg
spasms.
Ow!
It's
a
side
effect.
Terrible
side
effect
from
all
the
pill
popping.
But,
you
know,
it's
all
better
now.
I'm
clean
and
sober
and
I
apologize.
It's
okay.
Thirteenth
step,
right
there.
Back
to
drinking.
Oh,
Henderson,
you
thoughtless
oaf,
stop
texting,
open
that
door.
Why
do
you
keep
calling
me
Palmer,
so
lovely
to
meet
you.
Likewise,
really.
I
mean,
look
at
you
two.
I
mean,
it's
like,
Barbie
and...
Yes.
...Grandpa
Ken.

I
mean...
And
even
though
it
did
not
work
out
between
us
at
all...
It's
like
it
never
happened.
You
know?
It
really
isn't.
I
still
want
my
Danny
to
be
happy.
Oh,
look
at
that.
Happy,
happy,
happy.
Good
night,
kiddo.
Okay.
Hello.
It's
her
drug
dealer
I'm
thinking.
Okay,
please
put
her
on
the
phone
right
now.
Are
you
kidding
me,
honey?
You
know
how
I
feel
about
you
selling
your
brother's
stuff
on
eBay.
Hey,
hey,
hey.
Take
that
in
the
car.
No.
It's
okay.
I
will
deal
with
you
when
I
get
I
mean,
you
would
think...
You
have
kids?
Hmm?
Hmm?
You
have...
You
have
children?
We
have
sort
of
a
little
bit...
A
little
bit
of
children,
right?
When
were
you
planning
on
telling
me
about
these
children,
Danny?
I
don't
know,
but
listen,
I
have
to
go
get
to
those
little
munchkins.
Palmer,
so
nice,
seriously.
Danny.
No,
no,
no,
hey,
hey.
Okay.
Are
you
freaked
out
right
now
about
all
this
or...
Actually,
just
the
opposite.
The
opposite
of
freaked
out?
You
know
that
I
love
kids.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I
just
never
pegged
you
as
a
kids
guy.
I'm
a
huge
kids
guy.
I
love
kids.
Kids,
kids,
kids.
Is...
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
that's
my
thing.
What
are
their
names?
What
are
their
names
again?
There
is
the
girl
who,
of
course,
is
Kiki
Dee.
And
then
the
boy's
name's
Bart.
Which
of
course
is
short
for
Barto.
Well,
I
wanna
meet
them!
Of
course
you
do.
MAGGIE:
So
our
mom
doesn't
Not
yet.
You
know
this
is
kidnapping.
Stranger
danger.
What?
No.
Is
the
guy
from
Dateline
NBC
gonna
walk
in?
No!
I
know
you
two
a
long
time
and
Rosa's
here.

Doing
whatever
that
Rosa
does.
God,
she's
freaky.
DANNY:
Yeah.
So
here's
the
deal.
How
would
you
like
to
be
my
pretend
children
for
one
afternoon?
Why
don't
you
just
tell
that
poor
girl
the
truth?
You
know?
Our
mother
tells
us
everything.
Wedding
ring
boy.
What?
Oh,
my
goodness!
Did
you
see
Gossip
Girl
last
night?
It
was
so
good!
No,
she's
not
like
that.
Your
mother's
presenting
her
in
a
weird,
weird
way.
I'm
just
saying,
telling
the
truth
is
not
in
the
cards
right
now.
I
thought
you'd
be
excited
to
have
an
acting
job.
If
it's
an
acting
job,
we
should
get
paid.
Yeah,
you're
gonna
get
paid
in
experience.
I
wanna
actually
get
paid.

All
right,
what
do
you
want?
$600
for
the
day,
plus
overtime
if
we
go
over
eight
hours.
I'll
do
my
own
hair
and
makeup.
And
I
want
you
to
pay
for
the
six-week
that
my
mom
can't
afford.
$50
for
the
day
and
a
two-week
acting
$500
and
a
four-
week
acting
class.
$300
and
a
three-week
class.
Done.
I
would
have
done
it
for
$500.

I
would
have
done
it
for
the
experience.
Michael,
you're
up.
Opener?
I
want
you
to
take
me
to
Hawaii
so
I
can
swim
with
the
dolphins.
You're
not
gonna
let
that
one
go,
are
you?
We're
not
going
to
Hawaii,
pal.
Anything
else?
Find
someone
else
then.
Ooh,
the
Mafia
stare
down.
Very
good,
Michael.
We're
here
to
negotiate.
Do
you
have
anything
else
you
might
like?
I
want
a
flying
pony.
I
want
a
flying
pony
too,
Michael,
but
they
don't
exist.
Then
I
want
a
regular
pony.
And
How
about
a
Playstation
3
and
we
name
him
Nelson?
Keep
talking.
We'll
include
four
video
games.
Five
games.
And
I
want
the
meeting
with
blondie
How
'bout
Charlie
Choo-Choo's
'cause
it's
right
down
the
street
from
me.
Mention
that
slop-hole
again
and
I
walk.
All
right,
take
it
easy,
son.
Take
it
easy.
And
I
want
unlimited
tokens.
If
I
can
spend
'em,
I
wanna
have
'em.
I
don't
wanna
be
like
playing
Skee-Ball
and
all
of
a
sudden
run
out
of
tokens.
All
right,
I
can
make
that
happen.
So
do
we
have
a
deal?

Deal.
Deal's
off
unless
you
eat
that
pizza,
though.
Seriously.
Can
I
do
an
accent?
Let
me
hear
some.
'Ello!
No.
Okay.
My
kids?
Have
you
completely
lost
your
mind?
Are
you
kidding
me
right
now?
You're
the
one
who
picked
up
your
cell
phone.
That
is
not...
Mrs.
Harrington...
The
doctor
will
see
you
now.
I
can't
believe
you're
doing
all
of
It's
just
gross.
You're
just
pathetic.
I'm
not
trying
to
get
some.
I
already
got
some.
And
yes,
I'd
like
to
continue
getting
some.
I'm
pro
me
getting
some.
Have
a
seat
right
there,
Mrs.
Harrington.
Remove
your
shirt,
if
you
could.
I
smell
something.
You
smell
something?
I
smell
perfume.
Is
that
coming
from
you?

Maybe.
What,
you
got
a
date
or
something?
I
don't
have
a
date.
I
have
a
lunch.
You
got
a
lunch?
Who
you
got
a
lunch
with?
Dr.
Gervitz's
office
manager,
His
name
is
Brian.
The
guy
with
the
gray
soul
patch?
You
know
what?
Hey,
man,
I'm
Brian.
You're
mean!
Wow,
you
wanna
go
to
lunch
sometime?
Is
he
gonna
take
you
there
right
after
the
big
protest?
Hey,
man,
we
gotta
stop
these
squirrels.

He
plays
bass,
don't
he?


You
can
take
the
brassiere
off,
too.
And
by
the
way,
he
does
play
the
bass.
And
he
writes
songs.
What
does
he
write
songs
about,
how
bad
his
ponytail
stinks?
Mrs.
Harrington,
could
you
put
your
Okay,
so,
one
of
the
funbags
All
right,
what
happened
anyways?
Well,
I
hit
it
with
the
car
door
yesterday...
Right.
...and
I
heard
a
pop
and
then
some
sloshing
sound
when
I
walk.

Yeah.
I
think.
What
are
you
doing?
Could
be
the
kids
or
could
be
Brian.
Okay.
Stop
that.
Do
you
mind
just
for
one
second?
Let
me
just
talk
to
this
guy.

Stop!
Yeah.
Hello?
Yeah,
man!
Brian?
You
can
lie
down.
Yeah,
hi!
We
sure
are.
Yeah,
no,
sushi
would
be
groovy.
Okay,
I'll
see
you
at
1
:00
in
the
lobby.
Okay,
bye.
What
voice
was
that?
That
was
my
voice.
Really?

I
didn't
sound
like
that.

One
o'clock...
You're
excited
about
this
guy,
huh?
Mrs.
Harrington,
this
is
numbing
Oh.
Oh,
okay.
It's
gonna
be
one
afternoon.
Why
are
we
making
such
a
big
deal
out
of
this?
Because
you
know
what?
You're
in
your
dysfunctional,
sick
little,
When
I
was
negotiating
with
your
son,
Michael,
he
had
the
biggest
smile
I've
When
I
told
him
we
could
do
it
at
J.D.
McFunnigan's,
the
kid
looked
like
he
won
the
Heisman
Trophy,
I'm
not
kidding
you.
I
think
that's
enough.
Do
you
feel
that?
No.
No,
but
do
you
feel
that?
No.
We're
good.
By
the
way,
did
you
make
this?
Mmm-hmm.
We'll
have
to
give
it
to
the
Smithsonian
when
we've
done
the
operation.
Terrific
job.
Did
he
really
smile?
Swear
to
God,
like
the
cutest
little
smile.
And
I
got
Maggie
to
eat.
You
did?
Yeah.
Pizza.
Deep
dish.
Three
pieces.
I
can't
get
her
to
eat
anything.
I
know
you
can't.
Don't
do
this
for
me.
Do
it
for
the
children.
Yeah!
Oh,
stop!
Come
on,
you're
late!
What
are
you,
in
character
right
away?
Come
on,
let's
go!
She's
inside.

What
is
that?
What?
Did
Victoria
Beckham
have
a
yard
Are
you
kidding
me?
This
is
what
you
bought
for
me.
I
know,
I
know.
I'm
just
saying
is
it...
All
right,
we're
stuck
with
it,
I
just
think
it's
a
little
over
the
top,
but...
Thanks.
Happy
to
be
here
to
help
you.
The
first
rule
of
improv
is
always
If
someone
says
something,
just
go
with
it.
No
negating.
Gotcha.
That
sounds
good,
that's
smart.
In
my
acting
class,
when
someone
the
whole
class
yells,
"Die!"
No.
I
mean,
no
one
will
say
"no"
then.
Don't
yell
"die."
Who's
up
for
some
warm-up
exercises?
No,
honey,
I'm
not
gonna
do
that.
The
what?
The
tip
of
the
tongue,
the
teeth,
the
lips.
The
tip
of
the
tongue,
the
teeth,
the
lips.

I
got
one
for
you.
Shut
up!

All
right,
let's
go
already.
Are
you
ready
there,
Mafia?
Hell,
yeah.
Let's
do
it!



Stinks.
Smells
like
kids'
feet
and
like
skidmark
underwear.
Mmm.
Happy
Father's
Day.
DANNY:
Oh!
Jeez!

Mommy!
That
man
put
his
pee-pee
on
my
face!
What?
He
put
his
face
on
my
pee-pee.
Danny!
I'm
saying
he's
the
one.
I
don't
think
it
matters.
No,
I
get
you.
Oh,
oh!
Palmer,
darling.
Hi.
Devlin.
Thank
you
so
much
for
bringing
the
kids
today.
I
don't
think
she
was
the
only
one
who
brought
them.
You
know
what
I'm
saying?
They
are
my
pride
and
joy.
So
I'd
like
to
introduce
you
to,
the
one
and
only,
Kiki
Dee,
who
came
out
at
nine
pounds
four
ounces.
Yeouch.
And
then
the
whopper,
we
call
him,
Bart,
because
he
was
a
1
2-pounder
and
did
some
damage.
Okay.
So...
Hi,
you
guys.

Hello,
Palmer.
Heard
so
much
about
you.
You're
British?
So
you're
the
bird
what's
been
given
We
sent
her
to
boarding
school
last
year
in
England.
See?
So
she
picked
up
a
slight
accent.
It's,
you
know,
very
Madonna.
Well,
it
is
a
pleasure
meeting
you,
Kiki
Dee.
Wish
I
could
say
the
same.
You
see,
before
you,
I
had
meself
a
father.
I
was
the
apple
of
his
eye.
It
was
all
giggling
and
chasing
butterflies
in
the
meadows,
and
what
have
you.
And
now
what
do
I
got?
An
hour
and
a
half
every
other
week
at
J.D.
McFunnigan's
with
him
and
his
whore.
Koko!
Kiki!
Kiki!

God,
she's
in
such
pain.
No,
that's
the
pills
that...
She
took
some
out
of
her
mother's
bureau.
Are
you...
All
right,
let
me
go
see
her.
How
are
you
doing,
sweetie?
I'll
be
better
when
I
start
seeing
some
tokens.
He's
American.
Excuse
me.
Yo!
What
was
that
all
about?
That
was
raw
and
real
and
in
the
moment.
You
know,
I
feel
very
good
about
it.
You
do?
Well,
I
don't!
So
if
you
wanna
get
your
money
you
better
start
doing
things
right
from
now
on.
No
more
sob
stories.
And
we're
stuck
with
the
English
accent
now,
Ringo,
so
commit
to
it.
Don't
choke,
got
it?
Got
it.
Now
hug
me
and
laugh
and
let's
get
back
into
the
show.
Okay.
Papa!
You're
not
a
whore,
Palmer.
Okay.
That's
so
nice.
See
what
they
do,
they
fight,
then
they
make
up
and
it's
good.
Good.
We're
doing
good.

Are
you
kidding
me?
Got
a
hamburger
here
for
Bart,
Art
the
Water
Fart.
Here
you
go,
kid.
Look
at
that,
sweet!
And
two
quesadillas
for
Kiki
Sneaky
Here's
the
waters.
No
soda
for
you.
You're
battling
diabetes,
remember?
Huh?
Kiki
Dee?
I
got
you
two
quesadillas
'cause
it's
your
Well,
yes!
And
that's
why
I'm
going
All
right,
let's
see.
Yummy!

Thank
you.
Hey,
I
think
we
forgot
napkins.
We
did?
Okay.
Well
let
me
get
the
napkins.
Because
I
know
she's
not
gonna
get
up
and
do
it
because
she
doesn't
like
to
get
up
and
do
anything.
Oh,
nice.
Everybody
be
cool.
So,
Bart,
your
dad
tells
me
you
When
I
feel
it,
I
do
it.
What
else
do
you
like?
I
don't
know.
That's
our
Bart.
He's
a
man
of
very
few
words.
Ah.
Okay.
Maybe
I'm
upset.
Upset
about
me
and
your
father
dating?
No.
You
seem
to
make
my
dad
But
what?
Nothing.
Hey,
I
want
you
to
feel
comfortable
telling
me
anything.
Well,
I
just
hate
that
he
broke
his
promise
to
me.
What
promise?
Yeah,
what
promise?
He
promised
me
last
year
that
to
swim
with
the
dolphins.
They
have
this
lagoon
there
with
dolphins
and
people
get
to
swim
with
them.
What
are
you
doing?
But
without
warning,
my
dad
canceled
the
trip.
Why
would
he
do
that?

He
met
you.
He
what?
No!
Die!
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no!
I'm
saying
that
did
not...
You
misread
what
I
said.
I
said
we
have
to
go
to
Hawaii
earlier.
Because
I'm
excited
for
all
of
us
to
hang
out
there.
We're
going
to
Hawaii!
I
can't
believe
I
let
a
six-year-old
blackmail
me.
I
saw
my
shot
and
I
took
it.
You're
angry
at
yourself
'cause
you
got
us
into
this
whole
situation.
I
did?
You
really
did.
I
think
old
Mary
Poppins
with
the,
"You
can't
say
no.
You
can't
say
no,
Guv'nor."
Okay,
listen,
my
tolerance
for
these
continued
shenanigans
is
right
here.
And
if
it
gets
up
to
here,
I'm
taking
my
kids,
I'm
selling
you
out
and
I'm
going
home.
I
am
so
happy
we
are
doing
this,
Danny.
Are
you
kidding
me?
We're
going
to
Hawaii,
we're
gonna
swim
with
dolphins.
It's
gonna
be
so
much
fun.
I
was
just
telling
the
squirt.
And
Seventeen
magazine.
You
brought
that
for
these
guys
or
is
that
for
you?
It's
mine.
It's
my
favorite.
See
that?
Did
you
ever
read
that
magazine?
Thirty
years
ago
you
did.
And
hopefully
we're
gonna
have
EDDIE:
Wait!
Wait!

Danny,
wait!
Muffinstein,
I
could
not
stand
to
be
without
you.

Uh-oh!
Is
this
him?
I
see
the
Colonel
von
Generous
Okay,
I'm
confused
right
now.
I'm
so
sorry.
I've
not
introduced
myself,
we
have
talked
on
the
phone,
Devlin's
man-friendl
love
monkey.
Oh,
kill
me
now.
Devlin
said
you
had
to
stay
back
and
work.
I
did.
She
what
said?
Nein,
nein
to
the
work.
I
will
work
when
I
am
kaput.
You
know,
I
think
this
is
so
great
of
all
of
you,
so
mature.
I
would
have
loved
if
my
parents
when
they
got
divorced.
That's
why
I
was
thinking
we
Yeah,
I'm
glad.
I'm
glad.
It's
important
for
the
children
to
see
us
as
a
unit.
And
also
I
cannot
stay
away
from
this
potato
pancake.
She
loves
the
schnitzel,
you
know
what
I
mean?

You
know
what?
Tongue
feels
a
little
dry.
Let's
go
get
you
some
water,
honey.
We'll
be
back.
That's
a
big
tongue,
big
tongue.
Get
over
here,
get
over
here.
Ew!
What
are
you
doing
here?
I
don't
know,
saving
the
day.
Helping.
Hello?
Who
are
you
talking
to?
What
are
you
looking
at?
I
can't
see
in
these
things.
This
is
what
you're
gonna
do.
You're
gonna
tell
them
that
you
ate
a
and
that
you
are
feeling
like
you're
Katherine,
I
can't
go.
Okay?
Why?
Because
I
texted
a
picture
of
my
new
Oh,
you're
disgusting.
And
I
forgot
she's
engaged
to
a
UFC
fighter.
He
wants
to
punch
me
in
the
face.
I
wanna
punch
you
in
the
face.
Hey,
guys,
how
we
doing?

I
am
just
waiting
for
the
money
for
the
ticket.
Mmm-hmm.
So
you
are
coming?
And
I
am
paying?
Yes.
Dolph
has
zero
dollars.
Whoops!
Okay.
Let
me
see
if
I
can
find
my
credit
card.
Oh,
here
it
is.
That's
for
sleeping
with
my
wife,
pal.

There
you
go.
Thank
you.
Hey,
hey!
Didn't
have
time
to
make
any
reservations,
but
I
need
two
rooms,
please.
Oh,
of
course.
Unfortunately,
we
only
have
our
suites
left.
Oh,
boy.
The
Waldorf
Astoria
at
$8,000
per
night
and
the
Presidential
at
$12,000.
$12,000
a
night?
Mmm-hmm.
Do
the
Rolling
Stones
come
and
What
the
hell
are
you
talking
Is
it
made
out
of
panda?
I've
used
that
somewhere
else,
but
is
it?
No,
but
you've
made
some
terrific
suggestions
and
I'm
gonna
jot
them
down.
Are
you
a
member
of
the
Hilton
No,
I'm
not.
Oh.
That's
too
bad.
You
should
join.
Yeah.
Yay!
Just
got
reamed.
I
mean,
I
got
the
rooms.
Who
wants
to
go
to
the
beach?
Me!
Who
wants
to
start
drinking?
BOTH:
Me!

Okay,
yeah,
I
would
create
a
fake
family
for
that.
Oh,
my
God!
You
know
what?
You're
disgusting.
Mumsy,
please
do
come
in.
The
water's
as
lovely
as
Westminster
in
May.
No,
honey,
I'm
good.
I
don't
really
feel
like
swimming
right
now.
What
is
this
from,
my
Liebchen?
Don't
you
be
intimidated
by
which
is
perfect.
Oh,
come
on.
Like
she's
intimidated.
I
hope
when
I'm
her
age
I
look
that
good.
Yes,
right?
You
can
look
that
good
if
you
don't
take
the
elevators
and
only
take
the
stairs
like
Cary
Grant.
Take
the
stairs.
Take
the
stairs.
EDDIE:
Hey,
why
are
we
stopped
here?
Uh,
what's
the
matter?
I
can't
look
at
engagement
rings?
Engagement
rings?
Yeah,
you
heard
me.
Look
all
you
want,
but
you
and
I
both
know
that
you're
gonna
get
sick
of
this
hottie
and
you're
gonna
be
back
on
the
prowl
next
week.
Nope.
I'm
telling
you,
is
this
girl
not
cute?
Yeah,
she's
really
cute.
Is
she
not
the
sweetest?
The
nicest
person
I've
ever
met.
Did
you
ever
see
her
lips?
I
think
she
has
the
best
lips
I've
ever
seen.
They're
like
an
inner
tube
and
I
just
wanna
sit
on
it.
You
know
what
I
mean?
And
just,
like...
Do
you
want
me
to
knock
you
out,
or...
No,
I'm
saying
you
should
sit
on
her
lips.
Anyways...
You
know,
this
whole
situation
reminds
me
of
a
song.
Danny
is
a
big
plastic
surgeon
Who
never
had
time
for
a
wife
And
he's
friends
with
Davy
Who's
still
in
the
Navy
Piano
Man?
Why
Piano
Man?
No,
it's
"Piano
Dan."
That's
based
on
your
life.
It's
a
little
Eddie
remix.
Uh-huh.
Eddie
used
to
have
an
afro
And
So
he
popped
and
he
poked
'em
But
ladies
still
greet
him
with
mace

I
was
maced
one
time.
Five
times.

So,
guys,
we're
here
to
get
to
know
each
other
better.
Yes.
Yeah.
Dolph,
let's
start
with
you.
So,
what
line
of
work
are
you
in?
Well,
Palmer,
I
am
in
sheep.
I'm
sorry.
I
don't
know
what
you
mean.
I
am
a
sheep
shipper.
Oh.
Yes.
You
know,
people,
they
don't
buy
the
sheep
from
the
local
sheepherder
anymore.
Really?
They
don't?
No,
they
don't.
They
go
online!
Yes!
They
go
on
the
Interweb,
to
my
website,

And
leave
this,
please.
Thank
you.
Now,
people
go
on.
They
see
the
pictures
of
the
sheep,
and
they
pick
the
ones
they
want.
You
know,
it's
like,
"I
want
that
one.
"You
know,
it's
very
stylish.
You
Goes,
"Oh,
no,
I
want
the
shy
Or
they
buy
the
sassy
one,
who's
like,
"Hey,
I
see
you,
baa,
baa."
So,
what
do
the
people
do
with
these
sheep?
Whatever
they
want!
Sky
is
the
limit.
You
know,
some
have
them
as
pets.
Some
have
them
as
security
for
the
house.
A
lot
of
the
people...
The
new
thing
is
training
them
to
fight
each
other
in
the
Sheep
Fight
Club.
Sheep
Fight
Clubs?
Yes.
All
the
sheeps,
they
get
together.
They
baa,
all
you
hear
is,
"Baa,
baa,
baa."
And
then
you
see
hoof,
kick,
hoof,
kick,
hoof,
kick,
baa,
baa,
baa,
baa,
baa!
And
then
he's
out.
And
that
is
how
we
met.
She
bought
a
sheep
from
me.
Really?
Why?
Children?
Okay,
tune
out.
Okay,
'cause
some
secrets
are
coming
She
likes
to
shave
the
sheep
for
the
pelt
for
the
sex,
sexuals,
yes.
She
has
got
a
real
fetish
for
the
wool
and
stuff,
you
know.
We
do
this
thing
called
"sheepstenein."

Danny?
Would
you
come
with
me,
please?
Yeah.
Absolutely.
So,
we're
gonna
leave
right
now.
So
you
guys
play
that
game
Nobody
Talk
game.
And
start
now.
I'm
sorry,
we're
leaving.
I
can't
do
it.
No.
I'm
gonna
kill
that
guy.
He's
lost
it.
He
was
going
sheep-crazy,
I'll
give
you
that.
Where
is
your
hand
right
now?
You
wanna
see
where
it
is?
It's
not
even
here
anymore!
It's
gone!
How
about
I
beat
him
up?
You
can
beat
him
up
with
me.
It'll
be
fun.
I
don't
want
to!
I
have
to
go.
Don't
bail
on
me
right
now!
Don't
I
cannot
stand
that
face.
DEVLIN:
Katherine?
Katherine
Murphy?
Oh,
my
God,
Devlin
Adams.

Devlin?
Devlin
as
in
taking
a...
Taking?
From
what
I
see...
It's
my
favorite
college
Devlin!
Both
of
us
here
at
this
resort
at
the
same
time.
I
didn't
know
you
came
to
places
like
this.
Here
we
go.
Honey!
Honey,
I
want
you
to
meet
someone.
This
is
one
of
my
best
friends
from
my
sorority.
Katherine,
this
is
my
husband,
lan
Maxtone
Jones.
Pleasure.
You
might've
heard
of
him.
He
invented
the
iPod.
Well,
of
course
he
did.
The
iPod.
The
idea
just
came
to
me
in
the
shower.
A
shower
that
I
was
taking
with
Devlin.

So,
this
is
a
cabana
you
guys
Because
my
skin
is
so
white.
Even
at
night?
Well,
in
Hawaii,
you
never
know
with
the
sun.
Very,
very
strong.
So
you
mean
like
a
moonburn
or...

You
look
fantastic.
Oh...
You
look
great.
I'm
so
glad
you
got
your
teeth
fixed.
Much
better.
You
are
just
the
same
glorious
Devlin
that
I
remember.
Oh,
my
God,
I
ran
into
Sandra
Wernick
last
month.
The
poor
thing.
She's
already
She's
a
single
mother.
It's
a
disaster.
I
feel
so
bad
for
her.
Are
you
married?
Mmm-hmm.
Yes.
Oh!
I've
neglected
to
introduce
you
to
Danny,
Daniel
Leroy
Maccabee
Ill,
my
husband.
Yes.
If
you
want
me
to
stay,
will
you
just
go
with
it,
honey?
Come
here
and
please
meet
Devlin
and
lan.
Hey.
This
is
Daniel.
IPod,
what's
up?
How
are
you?
I'm
fine.
Invented
it.
Pleasure.
I
heard.
Devlin,
I
think
I
spoke
about
you
with
my
wife
in
the
bathroom
one
or
two
times,
right?
We
did.
Number
two.
We
did
it
twice,
yes.
So,
chief,
tell
me,
what
do
you
do
for
a
living?
I'm
also
an
inventor,
just
like
you.
I
invented
the
barking
hand.

I
got
you.
But
you're
sunburned?
No.
What?
You
are
a
surgeon.
He's
a
plastic
surgeon,
and
he's
one
of
the
best
according
to
Los
Angeles
Magazine.
Touchdown!
Yes.
Well,
that,
yeah.
Touched
it
down.
We
gotta
go
back.
We
have
to
We
have
to
get
back
to
our
kids.
So...
You
have
kids?
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah,
two,
actually.
We
couldn't
wait
to
start
creating
lives.
And
by
the
way,
I
created
these
children
in
the
shower.
Right?
You
did.
You
know
what
I'm
saying,
homeboy?

That
is
funny.
Wow,
you've
been
together
a
long
time.
Am
I
gonna
leave
this
girl?
Look
at
her.
Still
gets
the
flag
up
the
pole,
if
you
know
what
I
mean.
Bing-bang.
An
iRod,
I
should
say.
Oh.
Come
on,
hit
that.
Why'd
you
You're
so
clever.
That's
so
silly.
The
four
of
us
should
get
together
and
have
dinner
one
night.
Oh!
That
would
be
almost
like
a
dream
of
mine.
If
we
could
ever
get
ourselves
out
of
the
bedroom.
Katherine
Murphy,
look
at
you!
Oh,
no,
not
Murphy
anymore.
Leroy
Maccabee.
That's
right.
The
third.
Anyway,
so
it
was
great
The
big
E.
Love
the
Shuffle,
by
the
way.
Good
to
meet
you.
Bye!
Thanks.
You,
too!
What
are
you
talking
about?
She
was
nice.
I'm
gonna
kill
you.
Come
on.
I
don't
believe
that
just
happened.
I
like
that
you
need
me.
How's
that
make
you
feel?
Please,
it
feels
like
a
car
door
Come
here!
Listen.
What?
Do
you
know
how
I
feel
right
now?
You
were
getting
me
so
upset,
bringing
me
into
that
web
of
lies.
My
hand's
right
here
right
now.
Oh,
my
hand's
right
there.
You
know
what?
I
hate
you
right
now.
I've
gotta
write
out
a
bunch
of
index
cards
just
to
keep
up
with
these
lies.
Yeah,
and
you're
gonna
make
me



DANNY:
Oh,
my
God,
why
are
we
DANNY:
Oh,
my
God,
why
are
we
Why
did
you
wake
me
up?
Because,
Grandpa,
I
signed
us
up
for
the
all-day
adventure
tour.
We're
gonna
go
hiking
in
the
rainforest,
and
swimming
under
waterfalls.
Swimming.
I
hope
you
mean
skinny-dipping.
I'm
gonna
suggest
swimming.
I,
however,
am
fine
with
some
man
nudity,
Danny.
Okay,
so
Swiss
Family
nightmare
is
coming
with
us.
That's
so
we
can
bond?
Oh,
that'll
be
great!
MAGGIE:
It's
bloody
breathtaking
out
here!
Is
this
where
the
blue
Avatar
people
live?
Yeah,
the
blue
Avatar
people
and
I
think
that
black
pig.
KATHERINE:
Where?
The
pig.
Look,
how
cute.
Looks
like
Babe.

Oh,
my
God!
Go,
Go!
Come
on,
go,
go!

The
pig
is
eating
my
body!



Keep
your
eyes
on
the
river,
sweetheart.
Yes.
I
was
looking
at
the
canyon.

Hey,
what're
you
guys
doing?
That
bridge
can
only
handle
one
person
at
a
time!

Go,
go,
go!
DANNY:
What'd
he
say?
What'd
you
say?


Holy
Devlin!
Ow!
EDDIE:
Come
on,
let's
go.
Piggyback
times
are
magical
times,
aren't
they?
Yeah,
aren't
they?
You're
warping
my
spine
now.

I
think
Kiki
slipped.
Oh,
Father,
I
just
love
spending
time
with
you!
Oh,
my
God!
You
guys,
look
at
this!
KATHERINE:
Oh,
my
God!
MAGGIE:
It's
lovely!
KATHERINE:
Wow!
That
is
unbelievable.
I
don't
know
about
you
guys,
Really?
There
could
be
black
pigs
in
there.
I
agree.
Look
at
that.
That's
terrific.
Does
the
hotel
know
you
took
those
She
really
wears
that
bikini
well.
Yeah.
You
know
what
she'd
wear
well?
Don't
say
that.
Absolutely
gross.
EDDIE:
Oh,
my
God!
Gorgeous!
KATHERINE:
Perfect.
That
was
a
ten!
A
perfect
ten!
Yay!
So,
Al
Jolson,
you
mind
jumping
in
the
water
and
also
screaming
on
the
way
Okay.
Yeah,
do
it,
do
it
for
me.
Do
it
for
Da-da.
KATHERINE:
I
love
my
daddy.
Daddy
is
my
favorite
adult!

You're
paying
her
enough
for
this,
right?
And
I
love
you,
my
little
British
crumpet!
All
right,
homeboy,
you're
up
next.
Let's
go.
Come
up
with
something
on
your
own.
You
gotta
squeeze
out
another
log?
What
happened?
What'd
he
whisper
to
you?
Water's
too
deep.
Water's
too
deep
for
what?
He
can't
swim.
He
can't
swim?
And
you
wanna
swim
with
the
dolphins?
That
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
Hadn't
thought
it
through.
No
kidding
you
didn't
think
it
through.
Thought
about
spending
all
my
Danny!
I'm
saying,
I'm
not
the
kid's...
Okay.
No
one
taught
you
how
to
swim,
huh?
Well,
my
dad's
supposed
to,
but
he's
busy.
Uh-huh.
Busy
being
an
idiot.
You
guys
have
to
come
in,
the
water
feels
magical!
I
got
something
magical,
too.
I
don't
high-five
when
it's...
Downstairs
area!
No,
put
it
away.
Sorry.
No,
stop.
You
know
what?
I
think
Mommy's
gonna
Honey,
are
you
okay
to
hang
Sure.
Really?
You're
gonna
get
undressed?
What
are
you
doing?
What?
You
got
a
bathing
cap,
too?
You're
the
worst.
A
1920s
swimming
gown
on,
honey?
Don't
do
it.
Don't
take
it
off.
Yeah.
I
have
to
be
alone.
Okay.
God,
I
gotta
start
taking
the
stairs
more.
Don't
buy
that
line.
She
takes
spinning
classes
like
they're
M&M's.
I
think
he's
wearing
my
underwear.
What
is
he
doing?
Yo,
I
guarantee
you
fall!
I'm
all
set.

Ow!
Thank
you,
God.
I
wanna
climb
Palmer
Mountain,
so
what
do
you
say
we
get
rid
of
these
kids?
No.
They
had
them
last
night.
It's
our
turn.
Isn't
that
how
things
work?
We
alternate?
What?
No.
I
get
the
kids...
I
had
them
today.
That
counted
as
a
"me"
day
and
then
she
gets
them
at
night.
That's
how
we
do
it.
Oh.
Dolph,
Devlin,
do
you
want
us
to
watch
the
kids
so
that
you
guys
can
have
a
little
alone
time?
I
don't
think...
Yes!
Absoshnutely!
We
are
sleeping
together!
You
guys
have
your
own
beds
and
it's
our
time!
So
we're
gonna
watch
them.
Good.
You
guys
wanna
come
take
a
look
at
the
balcony?
I
think
I
saw
some
dolphins
around
here.
Dolphins?
Hey,
he
loves
those,
right?
Dolphins.
Sorry.
Okay,
go.
All
right,
let
go.
Come
on.
Get
the
dolphins.
Bye,
you
guys.
That's
why
we're
here,
the
dolphins.
See
you
out
there.
Listen,
if
anything
happens
and
you
need
any...
And
I
mean
anything,
you
have
to
call
me.
I'm
good
at
this,
I
swear
to
you.
I
used
to
baby-sit
Eddie
when
we
were
children.
Eddie
is
your
fault?
No,
no,
no.
But
I
want
you
to
enjoy
tonight.
Come
on,
it's
like
a
free
night.
You
can
do
whatever
you
want.
You
can
knit
yourself
some
socks
or
shock
people
with
your
sneaky
hot
body.
I
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about.
Cary
Grant?
I'm
just
gonna
sit
in
my
room
and
worry
about
you
and
them
and
everything.
What
about
just
hang
out
platonically
with
Eddie
tonight?
Have
some
dinner?
Or
is
he
not
good
enough?
You
need
Brian,
the
guy
from
Foghat,
around
here.
That
really
bothered
you
that
I
went
to
lunch
with
that
guy.
What
do
you
mean,
you
went
to
lunch
with
him?
I
told
you
I
was
going
to
lunch
with
him.
I
thought
it
was
he
asked
you
to
lunch
and
you
were
gonna
like
scoff
at
it.
But
you
did?
You
fell
for
his
charms?
I
don't
even
understand
what
this
is.
It's
the
beard,
man.
It
doesn't
move!
Well,
yeah,
in
the
wind,
man.
It's
flapping
around.
All
right.
You
know
what?
I'll
tell
you
this.
The
guy
made
it
through
an
entire
lunch
with
a
woman
without
making
up
a
fake
life.
Ah.
You
just
hurt
me.
That
was
not
nice,
but
it
was
the
truth.
And
I
speak
the
truth.
Please
pay
attention
to
my
children.
Everything
will
be
nice.
They
serve
room
service
in
the
hallway.
I'm
so
nauseous.
Okay.
Bye.
Alone
at
last!


Let's
play
the
game.
We
were
doing
so
good
with
the
game.
"If
you
could
be
one
person
besides
yourself,
"who
would
you
be?"
Rachael
Ray,
because
I've
always
wanted
to
know
how
to
cook.
Really?
Oh,
she's
darling.
You
know
what?
I
don't
really
wanna
be
anyone
else.
I'm
happy
with
who
I
am.
I
choose
me.
Or
Captain
Kirk.
Either
one.
See,
that's
a
good
one.
All
right.
What
about
you,
Bart?
Mr.
DeCesare.
Our
mailman?
Why?
He
just
seems
like
he's
got
it
all
figured
out.
We're
getting
deep.
Okay,
moving
on.
Uh...
Okay.
"Name
something
that
makes
you
sad."
That
Judi
Dench
has
never
won

It's
a
travesty.
That
'N
Sync
broke
up.
Yeah.
That
was
rough
on
all
of
us.

Who's
'N
Sync?
Sadness.
Bart,
you're
up.
I
don't
wanna
say
mine.
Okay.
Let's
move
on
then.
Hey!
Honey,
come
on.
You
can
share
anything
with
us.
Yeah,
share.
He
looks
like
he's
about
to
lose
it,
but
okay.
When
my
dad
doesn't
have
time
for
me.
Come
on,
it's
okay.
We're
okay.
We're
okay.
It's
fine.
It's
all
gonna
be
okay.
Come
on.
We
don't
need
him
in
our
lives.
Wow.
No,
no,
no,
he's...
MAGGIE:
We're
okay.
It's
fine.
It's
all
gonna
be
okay.
This
has
nothing
to...
This
is,
like,
from
a
long
time
ago!
It's
okay.
What
are
you
doing?
DANNY:
Well,
that
was
a
major
setback.
"When
my
dad
doesn't
have
time
We're
sorry.
I
know
you're
sorry.
I
know
you
got
real
stuff
going
on
with
your
family.
And
it's
painful.
But
you
gotta
just
hold
it
in
till
you
get
to
the
mainland
again.
You're
the
ones
who
wanted
to
come
here
and
go
swimming
with
the
dolphins
or
standing
with
the
dolphins
because
you
can't
swim.
Can
you
act
professional?
BOTH:
Yes,
sir.
For
at
least
two
more
days,
until
I
kill
you
off
in
a
boarding
school
train
accident?
I
thought
it
was
a
car
accident.
I
don't
know.
Either
that
or
a
science
explosion,
just
something.
You're
gonna
be
dead
soon.
That's
So,
can
you
just
focus
for
a
few
more
days?
BOTH:
Yes.
Good.
So,
give
me
some
fake
hugs
right
like
we're
the
happiest
family
on
earth.
Okay.
Is
that
possible?
And
laughing,
laughing,
laughing.
Okay,
that's
it.
Laugh
louder,
louder.

DANNY:
I
love
you
guys!
Hey,
sweetie!
What's
going
on?
What's
up?
So,
kids,
I
just
got
off
the
phone
with
your
mom
and
you
guys
are
gonna
have
plenty
of
time
to
spend
with
your
dad
tomorrow
because
she
and
I
are
gonna
ALL:
Aw!
Awesome!
Awesome,
awesome.
You
guys
are
so...
I'll
see
you
in
a
minute,
okay?
I
love
you.

Okay,
he's
losing
it.
Okay,
good
night.
He's
losing
it.
DANNY:
All
right,
here
we
go.
Everybody
out.
So,
what
are
we
doing?
Palmer
forgot
her
camera
in
the
room
so
I'm
gonna
have
a
surprise
for
her
when
she
gets
back
from
the
spa.
MAGGIE:
A
stolen
camera?
No,
some
pictures
of
us
having
a
great
time
reassuring
her
of
all
the
fun
we
have
together.
I
forgot
to
flush
the
toilet
before
I
left
the
hotel.
So
she's
gonna
have
two
surprises.
Okay.
No
one's
supposed
to
crap
as
much
as
you
do.
You
gotta
look
into
that
Pepto
Bismol
or
something.
Here's
your
putters.
Bing.
And
a
bam.
Thank
you.
Let's
just
look
right
in
the
camera.
And
we're
a
family.
We
love
each
other.
And
boo!

All
right,
let's
do
the
old
Michael-hit-a-putt
shot.
Okay?
So
boom,
that's
in
the
hole.
And
you're
excited
about
that,
and
we're
happy
for
him,
and...
Maggie
just
hit
the
ball,
but
you
and
it
made
you
fall
on
your
back.
Okay,
but...
Look
at
this.
You're
laughing,
but
I'm
a
concerned
"Oh,
my
God."

All
right,
now,
let's
just
laugh
at
something
I
You're
very
close
with
me,
and
Why
are
we
always
laughing?
Is
there
something
wrong
with
us?
No.
You're
just
amused
by
everything
Can
we
take
a
break?
Do
something
really
fun?
No,
we're
not
doing
anything
fun,
man.
We're
here
to
fake
having
fun.
Come
on.
Right
to
the
camera.
Don't
worry.
We
never
have
Oh,
man.

All
right.
How's
this?
I'll
teach
you
how
to
swim,
okay?
Before
your
mother
gets
back
from
the
"spa
day"
in
four
hours?
Is
that
even
possible?
Yeah.
But
we're
gonna
take
one
more
Make
that
two
pictures.
Maggie.
Throw
this
straight
in
the
air.
Make
it
look
like...
On
the
count
of
three,
one,
two,
Okay.
Now,
Michael,
lay
down.
On
your
back.
And...
Yeah,
all
the
way
over.
See
if
you
can
clench
this.
Now
look
like
you're
in
pain.
DANNY:
Ooh!

It
took
my
friend
a
whole
summer
How're
you
gonna
teach
me
so
quick?
I'm
gonna
do
it
the
same
way

Don't
worry.
It
took
Grandpa
eight
hours
to
teach
us.
It
was
a
nightmare.
But
there's
two
of
us
here
now,
and
we're
sober.
You're
gonna
be
fine.
All
right.
You're
doing
great.
Is
he
doing
great?
He's
doing
great.
Okay.
We
want
to
advance
a
little,
though.
I
need
you
to
swim
to
Uncle
Eddie.
If
you
get
there
without
touching
the
bottom,
we'll
give
you
a
dolphin
cookie.

Is
that
what
your
grandpa
gave
you?
No,
Grandpa
gave
us
something
he'd
call
a
Heineken.
I
want
one
of
those.
No.
Stick
with
the
dolphin
cookie.
Yeah.
They
hurt
less
when
they
God,
he
was
a
sick
man.
Yeah.
Okay?
Are
we
ready?
Don't
think
about
it.
Commit.
Kick,
kick.
Get
the
cookie.
Move
your
feet.
Kick,
kick!
Right
there!
Reach
for
it!
You
got
it!
Doing
good,
buddy!
There
you
go!
My
boy!
That
was
terrific,
buddy.
Have
your
cookie.
We're
gonna
move
on,
though.
PALMER:
Hey,
Devlin?
Devlin?
Yeah?
So,
Danny's
birthday
is
next
week,
and
I
have
no
idea
what
to
get
him.

Well,
don't
get
him
a
tie.
He
has
100
of
them
and
he
never
wears
them.
That's
good
to
know.
He
loves
books
on
tape
for
his
car.
Fishing
gear.
Loves
it.
Doesn't
use
it.
Can't
take
the
fish
off
of
the
hook
once
he
catches
it,
so
he
just
collects
it.
He
loves
candy.
Jelly
Bellies.
Loves
them,
his
favorite.
But
he
only
likes
the
Cotton
Candy
So
you
have
to
buy
the
bag
of
the
Jelly
Bellies,
separate
the
Cotton
Candy
and
the
Peanut
Butter
and
put
them
into
a
little...
It's
a
kind
of
Ziploc
baggies
that
I
got
online.
You
know
so
much
about
him.
Yeah.
I've
known
the
guy
forever.
Music.
Loves
music.
But
anything
after
'95,
don't
bother.
You'll
lose
him.
That's
when
I
finished
my
Girl
Scouts.
All
right.
How
many
cookies
do
we
got
left?
Maybe
about
forty!
What
do
you
think,
40
feet
for
40
cookies?
Can
you
handle
that?
You
need
a
little
rest?
Let's
do
this.
Really?
Okay,
he's
ready!
He's
ready
to
rock!
Almost.
What?
No.
Oh,
my!
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
off
come
the
floaties!
This
is
getting
serious!
Are
you
sure
about
this,
Michael?
Hell,
yeah.
All
right.
No
matter
what,
you're
a
good
man,
okay?
Keep
kicking.
I'm
here
if
you
need
me.
You
got
this.
Go!
Go,
Michael!
DANNY:
Go!
Breathe!
Yeah!
Kick
it!
Go!
Move
your
arms!
Yeah!

He
doesn't
have
floaties
on!
Oh,
my
God!
DANNY:
Get
the
cookies!
KATHERINE:
Come
on,
sweetheart!
You've
got
it!
A
little
bit
more,
little
bit
more.
Swim!
Swim!
KATHERINE:
Oh,
my
God!
EDDIE:
Come
on!
Just
a
little
bit
more!
Keep
going,
Michael!
Don't
give
up!

EDDIE:
Very
nice!
That's
my
boy!
Yeah,
buddy!
I
did
it!
I
did
it!
Thank
you!
No
way,
that
was
you,
buddy.
That
was
awesome.
Way
to
go!
What
are
we
looking
at?
Jeez.
Oh,
God.
Devlin.

Devlin.
Oh,
God.
You
snuck
up
on
me.
Did
I?
Oh...
Yes.
Do
you
startle
easily?
That's
a
sign
of
menopause.
Hmm...
Devlin?
Palmer
Dodge,
this
is
Devlin.
She
and
I
went
to
college
together.
This
is
Palmer
Dodge.
DEVLIN:
Aloha,
Palmer.
Is
this
your
daughter?
No,
no,
no.
I'm
actually
the
girlfriend.
Whose
girlfriend?
Yes,
hi.

I
am
the
Dolph.
Willkommen.
Married,
flattered.
Thanks.
Where's
Danny?
Danny
is
in
the
water
teaching

Hi,
Doctor!
He
was
so
sweet.
You
know
what's
so
crazy
is
that
with
the
first
name
Devlin
before.
You
know,
and
here
you
are,
and
Shark
attack!
We
are
playing
Bavarian
pool
rugby
Okay,
bye!
She's
trying
to
beat
me,
but
she
won't.
No
one
can!

This
is
fun!
Anyway,
something's
opened
So,
we
were
wondering
if
you
and
Danny
were
good
to
go
for
dinner.
Oceano's.
Seven
o'clock.
Oh,
no...
Oh,
no,
you
don't!
She's
like
a
shark.
Come
on.
Is
it
a
bad
night?
Are
you
two
fighting?
No!
We're
not
fighting.
No,
we
just,
we're
delighting.
We're
just
fine.
No,
that's
great.
Tonight's
gonna
Perfect.
Anyway,
see
you
tonight!
Okay,
Devlin.
Oh,
my
God!
Dolph,
let
her
breathe!
Yes,
I...

Dolph!
What?
What
was
that?

I
was...
Were
you
under...
I
don't
understand.
Why
would
you
say
yes?
Because
I
didn't
know,
I
didn't
say
no.
I'm
not
leaving
here.
What
would
I
tell
Palmer?

What's
going
on,
sweetie?
So,
today,
you
know,
with
Dolph
It
was
weird,
right?
No,
no,
no.
He's
a
sheepherder.
That's
what
those
guys
do,
you
know?
They
do
a
lot
of
horseplay
and
that's
kind
of
initiation
time
for
you.
You're
in
the
gang,
I
think.
Okay.
Yeah.
Well,
I
was
thinking
for
tonight,
maybe
we
could
have
a
little
me
and
you
time?
Oh!
I'll
get
my
rubber
duck
and
see
you
in
a
sec.
Yeah,
no,
I'm
not
doing
this
tonight.
It's
like
my
first
night
alone
with
the
girl.
All
I'm
asking
you
is
one
favor!
Just
get
this
one
dinner
with
me
so
I
can
save
face
with
this
horrible,
heinous
human
being.
What
am
I
gonna
tell
Palmer?
Would
you
just
put
her
on
the
phone?


Oh,
God.
Tell
me
she
is
not
listening
to
'N
Sync.
No,
no,
no.
It's
coming
from
the
elevator.
Hey!
Danny,
that
is
my
jam.
Someone
on
the
phone
for
you.
I
don't
know
who.
PALMER:
Okay.
Hello?
What
is
that?
It's
Palmer.
So?
I
need
you
to
get
on
the
phone.
I
need
you
to
take
her
as
far
away
Would
you
please
just
do
this
for
me?
No,
I'm
already
eating.
I
just
wanna
hang
out.
Ow!
Seriously,
I
need
you.
What
are
you
doing?
No.
Ow!
My
gosh.
Take
it.
All
right.
Go
for
Dolph.
It's
Dolph.
Okay,
I
got
an
idea.
How
about
you
and
me,
we
go
and
get
the
dinner
tonight?
To
supper?
Tonight?
Yes,
and
we
get
to
know
each
other,
because
I
think
it's
important
for
the
kids
to
have
good
symmetry
in
the
family
unit.
Yeah,
hang
on.
Let
me
check
with
Danny.
Dolph
wants
to
do
dinner
tonight.
No.
No,
no,
no.
All
right,
tell
him
yeah.
Yeah,
that's
fine.
Awesome.
Thank
you
so
much.
What
am
I
supposed
to
say
to
her
all
night?
You
spout
crazy
nonsense
for
hours
in
Eurotrashenese.
Just
do
it,
but
just
do
it
far
away
from
the
hotel.
Okay,
fine,
I'll
do
it,
but
if
I
do
good,
can
I
sleep
in
the
bed
with
you?
No.
Why?
You've
got
a
great
private
room.


Hmm,
really?
Because
when
they
said
that
wasn't
a
good
time
of
year
for
Merlot.
Oh.
How
about
the
Verite
Cabernet?
Isn't
Cabernet
really
grapey?
I
mean,
I
like
grapey,
but
not
overly
grapey.
Did
you
go
over
the
index
cards?
I
glanced
at
them,
yes.
You
glanced
at
them?
I
graduated
med
school
without
reading
a
book.
Just
relax.
Just
give
us
the
most
expensive
bottle
you
have
and
it'll
probably
be
good
enough.
Perfect!
Look
at
us,
Katherine.
Both
so
Can
you
believe
it?
Everything
I
always
hoped
for,
right,
Yogi?
Mmm.
Boo-Boo.
My
Yogi
Bear.
My
Boo-Boo.
IAN:
Never
enough.



IAN:
Hold
on
a
second.
I
love
the
way
you
smell.
Nothing
smells
as
good
as
Devlin.
Smelling
Devlin,
always
a
good
thing.

This
is
really
where
we're
eating?
Oh,
yes.
No,
the
hotel
says
it's
amazing
und
very
far
away.
Yeah,
it's
good.
Hey.
I
want
that
car.
I'll
give
you
two
chickens
for
it.
Two
chickens,
that's
very
nice
of
you,
but...
Don't
be
scared.
We're
just
here
for
dinner.
Also,
this
car's
worth
about
10,000
chickens.
Don't
pour
over
me.
Don't
pour
over
me.
I'll
bring
my
glass
to
you.
So,
Danny,
you're
a
plastic
surgeon.
Yes.
Very
convenient
for
you,
Katherine.
DANNY:
No,
this
girl's
had
nothing
done.
She's
just
a
natural
beauty.
She
really
is.
Sweetie.
What
about
me?
What
would
you
do
to
fix
me?
Professionally
speaking?
Nothing.
I
wouldn't
do
a
thing
to
you.
Nothing?
You're
too
sweet.
They
already
took
too
much
fat
out
of
your
arms,
but
that's
what
sleeves
are
for.
So,
where
did
you
two
meet?
We
just,
we
met
at
a
concert.
Sting.
Yeah.
Live
at
the
Index
Card.
It
was
a
benefit
for
the
rainforest.

Someone's
on
the
phone
for
you.
I
think
it's
the
guy
from
The
Omen.
Go
for
the
iMan.
Hold
on
a
second.
Can
I
say
something
before
you
Seeing
the
man
who
invented
the
iPod,
on
the
iPhone,
saying,
"Go
for
the
iMan..."
Yeah.
...that
was
like
watching
Ronald
McDonald
eat
a
cheeseburger
off
the
Grimace.
I'm
serious.
That
was
serious
stuff.
That,
to
me,
was
like
watching
Oh,
no.
I'm
sorry.
This
is
one
of
my
foundations.
I've
gotta
take
this.
Your
virtue,
your
intelligence,
your
passion.
Your
beauty,
your
drive,
and
your
womanhood.

It's
something
we
do
whenever
the
other
leaves.
We
say
what
we
love
most
about
the
other.
That's
really
nice.
That's
big.
I
like
that.
You
guys
should
try
it.
Yes,
we
should.
We
should.
We'll
try
that
later.
We
have
to.
Not
everyone
can
do
it.
We'll
do
it
now.
Right
now.
Okay.
So,
broke
and
penniless,
I
took
to
the
streets
to
sell
my
wares.
And
by
wares,
I
mean
my
body.
And
by
body,
I
mean
my
schnitzel.
Mmm.
Help!
Is
there
a
veterinarian
in
the
house?
My
pet
sheep,
he
passed
out.
He's
not
breathing!
I
don't
know
what's
wrong
with
him!
Him!
Him!
He's
not
a
vet,
but
Oh,
me,
yes.
I
do,
yes.
I
am
that.
Please
come
this
way!
Now?
Yes!
This
way,
this
way!
What
is
this?
Is
that
a
real
sheep?
Okay.
Yes,
um...
Hello...
Yes?
Yes,
in
my
expert
opinion,
that
sheep
is
dead.
I'm
very
sorry.
Let's
go
eat.
Okay,
show's
over.
Let's
go.

Oh!
He's
still
alive!
Please,
you
have
to
do
something!
Oh,
shit
on
me.
You
look
each
other
in
the
eyes
and
you
say
what
you
love
about
We
can't
just
say
it?
We
gotta
look
Okay.
Yes.
We're
so
ready.
Are
you
ready?
Go
ahead.
You're
on.
Okay.
Come
on.
Um...
I
love
your
sense
of
humor.
You
do?
Mmm-hmm.
All
of
it?
Every
dirty
bit
of
it.
I
love
your,
uh,
stories.
Yes.
They
can
go
long,
but...
It's
okay.
...I
try
to
finish
strong.
Always
entertaining.
And
I
love
that
you...
Love
that
you
read
the
index
cards.
Of
course.
And
I
love
that
you
secretly
have
a
huge
heart,
and
it's
just
filled
with
kindness
and
humility.
And
blood?
I'm
sure
there's
blood.
I
don't
know,
I...
I
just
think
you're
a
really
nice
I
really
love
spending
time
with
you.
That's
good
enough
for
me
right
there.
Yeah,
game
over.
Danny?
Game
back
on?
We
gotta...
Um...
Well,
I'd
like
to
start
off
by
saying
that
I
love
the
most
that
you
fixed
your
teeth.

Why
did
I
know
that...
They
were
horrible,
I
agree.
No,
no.
Um...
You
know
what
I
love?
Mmm-hmm?
How
you
just
do
everything
for
everybody
else
and
you
never
expect
anything
back.
In
fact,
when
I
say
thank
you,
I
don't
It's
cute.
And
I
love...
I
just
love...
You're
the
only
person
I've
never
lied
to
in
my
life.
I
swear
to
God.
I
just
trust
you
more
than
anybody
in
the
world.
You
know
every
secret
about
me.
I
love
your
smile.
That
smile
is
the
magic.
When
I'm
in
the
operating
room
all
I
think
about
is,
"All
right,
20
more
minutes,
I
get
to
see
the
smile."
It's
just
like...
It
starts
my
day,
that
smile.
I
won
best
smile
at
our
sorority
three
years
straight,
right,
Katherine?
Not
little
Bucky
here.
Okay,
here
we
go!
Hi,
yes!
Wee!
We
do
the
sheep
dance,
right?
We
want
to
live
and
dance
more,
yes.
Okay,
all
right.
Here
we
go.
Eat
some
food.
Eat
the
food.
Come
on,
here
we
go.
Couple
more
zings.
Make
the
milk.
Yes,
he
makes
the
milk.
You
love
it.
You
give
milk
to
the
baby.
All
right.
One,
two,
three,
here
we
go!
Come
on!
We
got
a
couple
things
that
I
know
how
to
do!

Yes,
this
is
a
good
test,
so
why
not?
All
right.
Here
we
go.
You're
killing
him!



The
sheep
lives!
The
sheep
lives!
Yes!
Here
we
go,
one
more
time.
Here
we
go.
Yes!
This
is
what
I
did.
You
saw
this.
Yes!
Welcome.
I
am
Tanner
Patrick,
Jr.
We're
ready
for
the
legendary
Legendary?
Never
heard
of
it!

Legendary
like
the
day
you
were
once
sober.
So...

She
talks
the
talk,
who
will
walk
the
walk
and
walk
with
me
to
the
Ladies'
Lounge?
Feeling
it...
I
think
you
should
do
it,
Devlin.

Because
she
would
win.

I'll
do
it!
Oh!
Good
show!
Katherine?
How
about
you?
Come
on,
this
isn't
Katherine's
thing.
Right,
Katherine?
No,
no,
not
my...
Her
speed.
Not
mine.
Some
people
are
just
more
comfortable
on
the
sidelines,
so
don't
judge
her,
honey.
Your
honesty,
your
fearlessness,
and
your
tickle
spot.
Your
creativity,
your
bravery,
and
your
taffy
nipples.

Let's
go!
How
do
I
win
this
thing?
I'm
gonna
do
this
hula
thing.
Oh,
don't
feel
any
pressure,
Katherine.
I'm
not
the
one
who
should
feel
the
pressure.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
a
warm
welcome

These
are
my
stars.
And
here's
the
key,
you
decide
how
brightly
they
shine
tonight.
You
the
audience,
judge
and
jury.
I
like
what
I
see.

This
is
my
hula
palooza.
You're
the
judges.
You're
voting
for
your
favorite
hula
girl.
How
about
we
do
one
over
here?
Can
I
get
a
little
something-something

Has
anybody
got
a
conscience
here
tonight?
Come
on,
you
did
well.
You
did
well.
ALL:
Aw!
TANNER:
It's
tough.
What
do
I
got
over
here?
Anybody?
How
tall
do
you
think
that
guy
is?
Who?
The
Tanner
guy?
I
don't
know.
Yeah,
that
Tanner.
Looks
pretty
tall,
I'd
say
he's
like
6'3".
Yeah,
I
don't
know.
Can
I
get
a
positive
reaction?

Thank
you.
How
about
this
little
girl?
Let's
I
like
it.
Keep
the
mojo
going.
How
about
Big
Country
in
the
corner?
Do
I
got...
Sorry.
This
is
fixed!
Tall
fellow
is
lucky
to
get
away.
TANNER:
Let's
pick
up
the
tempo,
boys.

What?
What
is
that?

Okay.
This
is
a
lot
faster.


Fabulous!

Yeah,
baby!

KATHERINE:
What?
Come
on.

Nobody
got
cheated
here
tonight.
These
are
two
of
the
hottest
chicks
we
have
ever
had
up
here.
But
our
job
is
not
done.
I
need
your
help,
because
I
need
a
winner.
Let
me
hear
you.

Beautiful!
Wow,
that
is
gonna
be
tough
to
beat.
Let's
not
kid
anybody.
How
about
over
here?

There
you
have
it.
We
have
ourselves...
That's
my
Boo-Boo!
A
tie!
We
have
ourselves
a
tie.
That's
great.
We
both
win.
Good...
What's
the
tiebreaker?
What's
the
tiebreaker?
This
is
how
we
settle
ties
in
my
house.
It's
something
I
like
to
call
Coconut
Smoochie.
The
object
of
the
game
is,
the
coconut
is
in
their
midsections.
It
must
move
all
the
way
up
to
their
mouths
without
the
use
of
their
hands.
Focus,
focus.
If
you
touch
the
coconut,
you
are
disqualified.
Okay.
Ready?
One,
two,
three,
get
coconutty!
Okay.
Slow.
Okay,
all
right.
Calm
down,
calm
down.
Let
me
just
bring
it
up
to
you.
Okay,
do
it.
Get
it
up
there.
Come
on.
Bring
your
coconuts
down
to
me.
Okay.
Oh,
my
coconuts.
Pull
up.
All
right.
I'm
so
low.
Squeeze
your
coconuts.
Squeeze
them.
Use
every
crevice
you
can.
Don't
be
afraid.
I
can't
get
it
up
here.
I'm
trying.
Would
you
be
quiet?
Stay
there.
Wait.
Okay,
that's
good.
Is
that
good?
Sorry
about
this,
by
the
way.
Really?
You're
really
sorry
about
this?
No,
I'm
not.
I
like
it.

Oh,
yeah!
Pick
it
up,
pick
it
up!
Not
with
your
hands,
you
buffoon!
Come
on!
Look
what
he's
doing!
What
happened?
I
can't
see.
Focus.
Take
it
slow,
take
it
slow.
He's
got
it!

That's
not
fair.
He
can't
do
that.
No,
that's
a
clean
pick-up
right
there.
Okay.
Bring
it
over
here.

Go!
Go!
Go!
I
got
it.

There's
still
time.
Let's
go.
You
can
touch
each
other,
you
cannot
touch
the
coconut.
Hang
on,
hang
on.
What's
going
on?
What
is
that?
What
do
you
use?
What's
the
hold-up?
You
still
got
that
perfume
on,
huh?
Would
you
stop
it?
Smells
good.
Come
on,
let's
go.
Have
you
got
it
to
your
mouth
yet,
Boo-Boo?
Stop
putting
your
ass
in
my
face.
TANNER:
I
like
it.
That's
my
girl.
Okay.

We've
got
a
winner!
We
have
Coconut
Smoochie
champions
right
here.
Awesome.
You
suck
at
everything!
Boo-Boo.
Great
teamwork,
guys.
How
long
have
you
two
been
married?
Eight
years.
Ten
years.
Ten
years.
Eight.
Very
long
time.
A
very
long
time.
KATHERINE:
Did
you
see
the
look
KATHERINE:
Did
you
see
the
look
Do
you
understand
what
joy
that
brought
me?
How
about
the
look
on
her
face
when
you
were
doing
the
juggling,
though?
The
juggling
was
the
highlight
for
me.
That
was
pretty
good.
You
liked
that?
It
was
so
cute.
And
when
you
talked
about
her
arms
getting
done?
The
good
news
is
she's
beating
the
hell
out
of
the
iPod
guy
right
now.
Right
now,
I
know.
That
was
good.
That
was
really
fun.
You
know
what,
I
think
that
was
the
first
time
that
you
and
I
have
ever
gone
out,
you
know,
just
us.
I
know.
I
do.
I
feel
bad
for
the
Soul
Patch
now.
I
do.
Now
that
you've
been
out
with
a
real
man.
And
by
a
real
man,
I
mean
a
man
who
showers.

I
think
it's
so
adorable
how
obsessed
you
are
with
this
guy.
I
just
can't
picture
you
guys
on
Who
said
it
was
a
date
ever?
You.
You.
You
get
very
excited
when
you
talk
to
this
man.
Listen,
Dr.
Gervitz
is
moving
his
Yeah.
Brian
is
not
gonna
go
with
him,
and
he...
He's
just
been
asking
me
if
I
would
want
to,
you
know,
replace
him.
You're
going?
No.
You
can't
do
that
to
me.
I
just
wanted
to
see
how
you'd
react.
Look
at
you.
You
can't
live
without
me.
"What
do
I
do?
How
do
I
sign
it?
"How
do
I
pay
for
it?"
No.
You
kind
of
played
with
me
a
little
bit,
though.
You
could've
told
me
that
earlier.
You're
just
messing
with
me?
Trying
to
get
me
a
little
jealous,
weren't
you?
No.
I
just
was
having
fun
teasing
you.
That
was
fun.
Why?
Were
you
jealous?
No.
Get
outta
here.
Was
I
jealous?
No.
Look
at
you.
You're
grinning,
you
I
didn't
know
you
had
that
many
teeth.
I
know.
I
got
like
55
teeth.

No.
So
there's
nothing?
You
and...
There's
nothing?
No
love
connection?
No.
Mmm-mmm.
Nothing.
Well,
then,
that's
a
shame.
What?
That
coconut
getting
in
the
way
tonight.
That's
a
shame,
don't
you
think?
Oh.
No.
No,
that
was
bad.
The
coconut.
You're
lucky
that
coconut
was
there.
You
couldn't...
You
wouldn't
Maybe
you're
right.
You
got
more
tricks
that
I
don't
know
about?
I
don't
know.
Okay.
I
don't
know
anything.
Mommy?
Mommy?
Hi,
guys!
Hey!
What're
you
doing?
The
babysitter
fell
asleep.
Oh,
great.
I
mean,
come
on,
it's
like
a
Hawaiian
Rosa,
huh?
Is
it?
Oh,
my
God.
DANNY:
Yeah,
that's
asleep.
KATHERINE:
Look
at
that.


DANNY:
Wow.
KATHERINE:
She's
out
deep.
All
right.
Good
to
see
you
guys.
Good
night.
Good
job.
One
more
day
of
lying,
guys.
We're
almost
done.
Home
stretch.
All
right.
So,
you
gotta
go
to
sleep.
Yeah.
Tired?
Yes.
Good
night.
Okay.
That
was
fun.
Good
job.
Good
night.
Good
night.
Good
night.
All
right.
Okay,
Danny.
Okay,
good
luck.
I'll
see
you
in
the
morning.

She
ain't
going
to
sleep.

Hello!
There
he
is,
Danny!
It's
nice
to
meet
you.
Where
were
you
going?
What?
I
was
going...
I
was
going
to...
Where
were
you
guys?
I
was
looking
for
you
guys
at...
What
happened?
How
was
the
dinner?
Dolph
gave
mouth-
to-mouth
to
a
sheep.
Yeah.
And
then
we
had
a
few
drinks.
Yes.
It
was
choking
and
so
I
gave
him
sheep-P-R.

But
he
was
the
black
sheep
of
the
family,
but
he
was
also
white,
if
that
makes
any
sense.
And
we've
been
talking
about
how
and
how
amazing
you
are.
Yeah,
all
joking
aside,
it
really
has
been
first-class.
And
that,
if
the
kids
and
I
hadn't
kept
you
so
busy,
that
you
might've
had
the
time
to
do
something
you've
been
thinking
about
doing?
The
one
ringy-dingy?
Uh...
Yeah,
you
told
her
about
that?
I
don't
need
you
to
get
me
a
ring,
Danny.
Let's
just
get
married.
Right
here.
What
now?
Why
not?
We're
in
Hawaii.
Let's
do
it
tomorrow.
I
mean,
this
has
felt
special
from
And
I've
seen
the
way
that
you
are
with
the
kids,
and
it's
exactly
the
way
I
always
Oh,
man...
I
don't
wanna
wait.
I
just
wanna
start
my
life
with
you.
Hi!

Hi,
everybody!
Dolph.
There
you
are.
I
have
been
looking
everywhere
for
you.
For
me?
Yes.
Come
here.
Come
on,
let's
go.
No
way,
we
can't
go.
What?
My
little
Oompa
Loompa.
Danny
and
Palmer,
they're
getting
married
tomorrow!
What?
No,
no,
I
mean,
why?
Yeah,
we
are.
But
what
do
you
think?
What
do
you
mean,
what
do
I
think?
I
mean,
what
does
it
matter
what
I
think?
I
think
that's
great.
Thank
you,
Devlin.
I
really
hope
that
you
can
be
there
tomorrow.
I
can't.
It's
really...
It's
bad
luck
for
the
ex
to
be
at
the
wedding.
Come
on,
Dolph.
Let's
go.
Where
are
we
going?
They
are
here.
We
gotta
have
the
sweet
sex.
What?
Okay?
Come
on.
Okay.
Congratulations,
though.

PALMER:
I'm
trying
them
on
as
we
speak.
I
know,
but
I
just
bought
them.
I
had
some
with
me
and
the
one


Michael!
Nincompoop!
Nincompoopenschtic!
Michael,
the
crap
is
the
stinking...

Hello?
DANNY:
Hey,
you
up?
Hi.
Yeah.
Glad
you
called.
Are
you?
Um...
Yeah,
I
was,
uh,
just
checking
flights
for
your
parents
tomorrow
and
I
found...
No,
no,
no.
You
don't
have
to
do
that.
Her
parents
aren't
coming
in
and
she
wants
it
to
be
kind
of
elope-y.
Elope-y.
Got
it.
Okay,
uh,
so,
are
you
all
set
for
what
you
need
to
wear
tomorrow?
Do
you
think
this
is
a
good
idea?
What?
The
wedding?
Yeah,
the
wedding...
Just
the
whole
Palmer
thing.
Well,
that's
why
we
came
out
here,
right?
I
guess.
You
don't
think
it's
crazy?

Um,
Danny,
you
don't
need
my
permission.
Okay?
You're
a
big
boy.
I
know,
I
just...
I
know
if
I
do
this
that...
Just,
things
could
get
weird
between
you
and
me
at
the
office,
so...
Well,
you're
not
gonna
have
to
worry
about
that.
You
going
to
New
York?
Yeah.
I
just,
you
know,
I
mean...
As
much
as
I
was
looking
forward
to
you,
um,
reconstructing
my
face,
I
really
just
need
to
start
fresh,
you
know?
Hello,
are
you
there?
You
understand?
I
guess.
It's
an
awful
lot
of
guessing
I've
been
divorced,
I
have
two
kids,
I
don't
have
time
for
guessing.
Got
a
big
day
tomorrow,
Doc,
all
right?
So
why
don't
you
just
get
yourself
some
sleep?
So
that's
it.
You
have
nothing
else
to
worry
about.
We
have
the
flowers,
the
music
and
the
location,
which
is
ha-wowie,
by
the
way,
you're
gonna
love
it.
I
promise
you
it
is
going
to
be
the
most
wonderful
day
of
your
life,
guaranteed.
Devlin.
Yeah.
Oh!
Palmer!
I
didn't...
Well,
you
just
look
absolutely
beautiful.
Really?
Thank
you.
Yes.
Devlin,
can
I
ask
you
something?
'Course.
Do
you
still
want
to
be
with
Danny?
Wait.
What?
Because
I
think
that
he
still
may
be
in
love
with
you.
Really?
Why
would
you
think
that?
He's
always
glowing
when
you're
around.
And
he
laughs
at
your
jokes.
He
doesn't
laugh
at
mine.
Palmer,
trust
me,
there
is
nothing
We're
just,
you
know,
we're
familiar.
And
you
are
the
girl
for
him.
He
even
told
me
that
last
night.
My
God,
Devlin,
this
is
such
a
relief
because
I
could
never
stand
a
Turn
around.
Tell
me
if
this
fits.
Put
the
hanger
up
your
nose.

Stop!
Excuse
me.
Here
you
go.
Thank
you.
Katherine!
Katherine!
Oh,
Devlin.
That
was
so
much
fun
last
night.
I
know.
I
am
still
trying
to
work
out
how
you
cheated.
I
didn't.
That's
what
happened.
So,
where's
Danny?
Devlin...
Danny's
at
his
wedding.
Come
again?
I
was
never
married
to
him.
All
a
big
lie
that
I
made
up.
Why?
'Cause
I
couldn't
stand
the
thought
Really?
So,
yeah,
I'm
a
single
mother.
I
have
two
kids
that
I
love
more
than
anything
in
the
world.
I
drive
a
Honda.
Still
have
dial-up
internet.
I
got
a
2.7
GPA
in
college,
not
a
3.4.
And
while
I'm
at
it
telling
the
truth,
I
named
my
kids'
poop
after
you.
And
I
work
for
Danny.
I'm
his
assistant.
That's
it.
Really,
I
would
never
have
guessed
this.
I
mean,
you
two
had
a
real
connection.
He's
great.
He's
the
greatest
guy.
And
I
might
even
be
in
love
with
him,
but
that
doesn't
really
matter
at
this
moment
because
he
is
getting
married
lan
and
I
are
breaking
up.
What?
What
happened?
Well,
for
starters,
he's
gay.
He's
gay?
I
mean,
look
at
him.
That's
a
strong
muscle
right
there.
I'm
squeezing.
Devlin,
I
gotta
tell
you,
last
night,
with
the
ass
grab
of
the
coconut,
little
bit
of
a
red
flag.

I've
seen
him
do
that
with
the
soap.


What
about
the
iPod?
Oh,
he
didn't
invent
shit.
He
didn't?
No!
He
made
his
money
suing
the
Dodgers
after
he
got
hit
by
a
foul
ball.
Oh,
God!
That's
so...
What?
Well,
this
is
different.
Yeah,
why
didn't
we
try
this
truth-telling
thing
before?
I
don't
know.
Hey.
Hey.
What?
That's
nice.
It's
nice
to
tell
the
truth.
That's
good.
The
truth
is
fun,
isn't
it?
Like,
were
you
telling
the
truth
when
you
said
you
might
be
in
love
with
me?
I'm
gonna
leave
you
two.
Okay.
I'm
gonna
go
get
a
divorce.
Good
luck.

Wait,
where
are
my
kids?
Palmer
took
them
out
for
ice
cream.
So,
how
was
the
wedding?
Okay.
All
right.
So,
we're
standing
on
top
of
this
beautiful
cliff.
Uh-huh.
I
start
looking
out
into
the
Pacific,
and
I
think
to
myself,
"Wow.
I
am
about
to
start
my
life
"with
the
one
I
love."
And
the
only
problem
was,
the
one
I
love
was
not
with
me.
She
wasn't?
She
was
not.
So
you
didn't?
I
couldn't.
You
couldn't.
I
mean,
don't
we
have
something
extra
happening
with
us?
Danny,
I...
What
happens
when
we're
not
on
fake-cation
and
you
wake
up
and
realize
this
is
real?
You
are
the
only
real
thing
I've
ever
had
in
my
life.
Danny,
come
on,
man.
I
don't...
She's
beautiful
and
she's...
I'm
not
twenty-three.
I'm
not
that.
She's
good,
she's
very
nice,
there's
only
one
problem.
She's
not
you.
She's
not
you.
I
have
two
kids.
I
can't
just
drive
them
off
a
cliff.
You
know?

I
love
those
kids
more
than
anything
in
the
world,
Guv'nor.

No,
I
wanna
be
with
those
guys
like
23
hours
a
day.
What
about
the
other
hour?

SAILOR:
Good
job!
That's
what
I'm
talking
about.
Whatever!

DANNY:
Well,
everything
turned
out
pretty
good
for
everybody.
Squirt
got
to
swim
with
the
dolphins.

Palmer
met
some
tennis
player
her
who's
an
even
bigger
fan
of
'N
Sync.
And
Maggie's
about
to
start
a
three-week
acting
class
with
the
actual
Dolph
Lundgren.
And
what
happened
for
me?
Well,
I'm
finally
wearing
my
wedding
ring
for
real.
And
now
when
women
ask
me
about
it,
I'm
gonna
tell
them
I'm
married
to
a
woman
who
doesn't
beat
me,
doesn't
cheat
on
me,
doesn't
drink...
Well,
doesn't
drink
that
much.
And
who
I'm
gonna
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
with.
A
woman
named
Katherine.
Would
you
like
to
dance
with
Yes,
I
would,
Mrs.
Maccabee.
Yeah,
it's
okay.
One
more.

You
were
right,
Soul
Patch
is
going
hard
on
that
bass.
What
did
I
tell
you?
Uh-huh.
Hey.
Encore,
man.
I'm
just
kidding.
Stop.
I
get
it.
It
is
long
and
it's
gross.
You
don't
need
wind
for
that
thing
to
swing
around.
