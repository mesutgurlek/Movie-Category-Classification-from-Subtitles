him...

One

Maxim
Gorky

The

Hurry

How

the
horns,
comrade?

Ten

Ten
marks.

Look,
I'll

you
five.

No
way.
Ten.

Dad,
what
do
you
want
with
it?
-
One
horn
for
five
marks.
One
million
horns,
five
million
marks.
Isn't
it,
comrade?
-
Sure.
-
How
much
for
the
washing
machine?
-
Fine
machine.
Extra
good.
-
Comrade.
Let
me
tell
you
something
even
better...
-
No
way.
280.

Sold.
-
Should
I
help,
Dad?
-
The
other
side!
-
Careful,
Dad!!
-
The
washing
machine...!
-
Hey!
-
The
Russians
have
fucking
scammed
us
once
again!
-
Come,
have
a
look.
-
We
got
water,
not
Diesel!
-
What?
-
I'm
sayin',
water.
Have
a
look.
-
What
the
hell?
-
That's
Diesel
all
right!
-
This
is
water!
-
Both
barrels?
:
"The
cold
rain
falls
at
dawn..."
-
Why
is
she
wearing
spy-glasses
-
She's
expectant!
-
Here's
money
for
your
surgery.
-
Thanks,
uncle
Grga!
God
bless
uncle
Grga!
-
This
is
too
little!
-
Mother
will
have
twins,
the
u'trasound
has
told
us!
-
Piss
off,
back
into
your
gypsy
mother
and
away
from
me!
-
Gate,
gate!
-
Halt,
what
do
you
want?
-
G'day.
-
I'm
Matko
Destanov.
...hands
up!
-
Goose,
come
in!
-
I
was
planning
to
...to
the
fair
in
Pécs.
-
Go
to
the
fair
wherever
you
like,
:
-
All
right,
everyone
get
the
fuck
out!
-
Oh
Little
bird,
you
have
returned?
-
Me...?
Back
from
where?
-
You've
been
here
before...5
years
ago.
-
Don't
lie
to
me!
...big
players
like
you
relocate
often!
-
Eight
years
ago
then.
...oh
yes,
yes,
hats
off!
My
compliments,
uncle
Grga!
-
Look
into
my
eyes.
-
Why
are
you
here?
And
don't
tell
lies.
...I
would
do
anything
for
your
father.
...he
saved
my
life
twice.
...in
Genova,
and
in
Marseille.
...he
beat
up
half
the
city...to
get
me
out
of
jail.
...he
is
a
gentlemen.
-
Was.
May
he
rest
in
peace.
-
Who
should
rest
in
peace?
...so
unexpectedly...Would
you
have
thought?
...I
became
an
orphan...just
like
my
little
finger!
...unprotected...at
everyone's
mercy...
-
I
know
that
you
lot
ruined
his
life.
-
Allright,
allright,
that
didn't
last
too
long!
Everyone
makes
mistakes
in
life...
...but
now
I
understand
I
was
on
the
wrong
path
and
have
shown
them
the
finger
as
the
it's
said...
...Uncle
Grga,
I
have
a
bloody
good
business
proposition!
-
What
kinda
plan?
-
A
train?
...wagons
loaded
with
gasoline.
-
Twenty
wagons
altogether.
...but
Uncle
Grga,
since
my
father
died...
...I
have
nobody
to
help
me.
-
That's
business
for
the
big
guys.
-
They'll
screw
you.
-
No,
Uncle
Grga.
I've
got
it
all
...I'll
bring
the
paperwork,
it's
all
here,
clear
as
water.
....son!
Son!
-
Don't
come
back
without
a
wife!
-
What
are
you
up
to
now?
You
want
to
swindle
him?
-
Smile
you
dumbass.
-
I
received
this
urgent
fax.
...all
the
details!
-
Birdy!
Come
here.
Come
here.
-
Goose,
over...come
in....goose...
-
I'm
here,
uncle
Grga.
Everything's
in
the
fax.
...
I'd
need
70,000
marks...
-
What,
boss?
-
Goose,
the
labourers
can
go
home.
-
All
right,
boss.
-
If
you
loan
me
70,000
within
a
-
Do
you
see
that?
-
I
see
it,
uncle
Grga.
I
see
it.
...Uncle
Grga,
you
sure
have
a
lot
of
dosh.
-
I'll
help
you,
but
only
because
of
your
father.
...and
I
fully
expect
you
to
report
back
to
me
all
about
this
'bloody
lucrative
business'
...or
else
I'll
send
my
grandsons
after
you...
...and
splinter
your
bones!
-
Am
I
making
myself
clear?
-
Weirdo.
-
Why
did
you
say
that
Granddad
had
died?
-
He's
in
a
hospital,
or
dead...
...he
has
a
large
cement
factory
...Zare,
my
son.
With
this
money
...and
your
children's
future.
-
Leave
me
be.
-
Zare!
-
Zare!
-
What
do
you
want
now?
-
Come
son,
take
a
look
at
this
miracle!
-
Now
that's
what
I
call
an
invention.
...only
those
Germans
can
...but
your
daddy
promises
you...
...if
we
become
rich,
he'll
buy
you
a
ship
like
that...
-
Zare!
...Dadan...
...he's
here!
Our
benefactor
has
arrived!

"Pitbull.
-
Fortune
favours
the
bold.
-
Your
mother....I
keep
you
fed
and
this
is
how
you
thank
me?!
-
"The
dice
is
cast."
-
Welcome,
my
dear
brother.
-
What
the
fuck
do
you
care?
-
Well
shut
the
fuck
up!
Ehh...
-
Ohhh
fuck...
-
What
are
you
staring
at?
Stop
staring.
Chill
out!
Read
something!
-
Why
did
you
come
here?
-
I'm
sick
of
these
thieves
around...
-
What
are
you
waiting
for?
-
I've
know
of
a
lucrative
plan.
-
Trust
me,
it's
100%
fail-safe.
...it's
the
plan
of
the
millennium.
...I've
got
a
connection
in
Jordan.
He
sells
me
a
train
full
of
gasoline.
...brilliant.
A
great
buy.
-
I'm
broke...
...listen...I'd
need
a
person
to
help
me
out
at
the
customs...
-
Don't
worry
about
customers
old
pal.
...The
Bulgarians
always
say:
"Brother,
if
you
...solve
it
with
a
lot
of
money.
"
-
Lil'o
whiskey...
-
What's
this,
eh?
What's
this?
...you're
giving
him
whisky
in
a
gin
glass?
...you
stupid
bitch!
Get
the
hell
out!
-
Get
lost
all
of
you!
Get
the
fuck
out!
...you
too,
out!
-
He
said
nothing!
...what?!
-
Piss
off!
Piss
the
fuck
off!
....get
the
hell
out,
suckers!
...I
have
no
racial
prejudices!
...huh,
Matko?
...ever
since
you
were
a
kid...
-
I
would
have
been
okay
drinking
out
of
the
bottle
too.
...on
our
deal!
Let's
drink!
-
Ah
you're
such
a
cutie!
-
You
should
find
a
wife
for
your
son
soon.
-
Is
he
honest?
-
Good
for
you.
You're
the
image
of
a
real
man.
...this
happens
ever
again
and
I'll
fuck
your
junkie
mothers
you
sons
of
bitches!!
-
What
you're
whining
about?
-
What's
that
to
me?
Tell
me.
...am
I
successful?
Yeah!
I
have
a
house
as
large
as
a
castle.
...2,500
square
metres.
...Take
a
look
at
the
Old
Man's
mausoleum.
-
Ain't
it
beautiful?
...why
are
you
crying,
Dadan?
Don't
cry.
...why
shouldn't
I
cry?
Lemme
cry!
-
It's
a
shame.
A
shame.
-
I
can't
marry
out
my
sister.
...it's
a
disgrace!
-
Don't
you
worry,
my
brother.
...But...we
should
close
our
little
deal
here...
...cheers.
-
Hello!
Hello!
Hello,
Aksim?
...I'm
in
deep
shit...I
could
do
with
a
bit
of
help
here...
...I've
heard
you
have
a
singer
who
can
pull
a
nail
out
of
logs
using
her
ass?
-
Go
serve
the
customer.
-
He'll
let
us
know
if
he
wants
something.
-
What's
her
name?
Black
Obelisk?
...this
fucking
phone,
it's
killing
me,
it's
eating
my
nerves!
...it's
eating
my
whole
life!
...damn
it.
Go
water
the
telephone
pole.
-
May
your
phone
die
a
horrible
death...
-
Hey
you.
Come
here.
-
Who?
Me?
-
Stop
pretending
you're
waiting
for
someone.
-
I
only
want
a
lemonade.
-
Of
course.
-
How
many
times
I
need
to
tell
you
to
water
the
pole?!
Get
on
with
it!
-
What's
up?
-
What
a
"man"...lol.
-
Get
goin'!
-
Hey
Aksim,
I
can't
hear
a
fucking
word...nothing!
-
What
are
you
waiting
for?
-
I
can
hear
you
now
better,
...listen!
Get
on
the
fast
train
and
be
here
by
tomorrow
as
there's
a
show
to
be
done!
-
Hey,
no
lemonade
for
me?!
-
You'll
get
that
-
Music!
-
My
dear
grandson.
-
I
got
your
stuff
for
you.
-
What
does
the
doc
say?
-
All
sorts
of
bollocks.
I'll
live
to
be
a
hundred
unless
the
devil
takes
me!
-
And
your
liver?
-
You
shouldn't
drink
that
much.
-
What
do
you
mean?
This
time
I'll
be
getting
really
drunk
for
once!
...time
for
me
to
get
wasted!
-
This
is
a
hospital!
-
Doctor,
you've
got
to
make
-
Imagine
what
it
would
be
like
if
-
Ma'am,
you
really
needn't
be
so
cross!
No
need
for
it
at
all,
no
need!
...here's
a
bit
of
money
for
you!
-
Freedom!!
-
Excellent
booze.
Burns
my
intestines...
-
Grandson,
I've
got
to
tell
you
something.
...your
mother
is
dead,
and
your
father
is
a
filthy
bastard.
-
I
sold
the
cement
factory.
-
Aye,
that
I
did.
It's
gone
now,
just
like
if
I
never
had
it
in
the
first
place!
...check
this
out!
...I
sold
it
to
that
dirtbag
Dadan.
...your
future
is
safe.
If
you
need
money,
...whom
I
haven't
seen
in
25
years.
-
I
know.
Grga
Pitic.
-
You've
told
me
about
your
friendship
-
A
seven-foot-tall
giant
with
...he's
got
two
rows
of
teeth.
...one
the
regular,
but
the
other
is
golden!
...elegant
as
a
vampire.
-
Music...
attack!!
-
Shoot
here
you
asshole,
shoot
here!
...Here's
a
flowerpot!
And
another
one.
Have
this
too!
-
What
are
you
doing?!
-
Hey,
leave
me
alone!
It's
okay,
I'm
goin',
I'm
goin'!
...careful
now,
I'll
beat
the
shit
out
of
you!
...
I'll
get
you!
-
I
shit
on
Death!
-
I'll
get
you,
you're
mine
now,
I'll
smash
your
bloody
face!
"Louis,
I
think
this
is
the
beginning
-
Boss,
try
this
please,
what
do
you
think
about
the
tase?
-
Our
whisky
is
better
than
the
real
thing.
-
Logical.
Our
method
is
better.
-
Where
are
you,
children?
-
Sit
down.
-
That's
enough,
children.
-
You,
what
have
you've
been
up
to?
-
We've
been
to
ten...twenty
fairs!
-
I
asked
something,
jackass.
-
I
can
find
women
for
entertainment
or
to
foul
around
with,
but
good
wife-to-be...that's
difficult!
-
Be
ashamed.
All
your
friends
are
married
...when
I
was
your
age
I
had
...it's
all
about
taste.
...don't
be
fussy.
Find
a
girl
and
get
it
over
with.
-
Granddad,
tell
us
about
number
five
...we
love
listening
to
that
story
a
lot.
-
My
darling.
...even
the
memory
of
her
is
...my
little
dove...
-
Blood
doesn't
turn
into
water.
...if
you
managed
to
find
the
right
one
for
yourself,
so
will
I!
-
When
will
that
be?
-
Why
won't
you
be
a
good
boy
and
-
Yesterday
I
had
another
stroke.
-
Again?
-
I
beg
you
for
the
last
time:
...take
me
to
the
hospital
...I'll
get
out
for
your
wedding.
...bring
me
a
daughter
in
law.
-
Ok,
grandad.
-
Kssss,
cat.
-
Black
cats
are
bad
luck.
-
Take
care
of
the
passenger
train,
-
My
lil'o
train!
-
One...
...two,
three...
...five...
...six...

...eighteen...
-
Boo!
-
All's
well?
...this
calls
for
a
celebration.
Drink
up!
-
I
am
scared
shitless
of
being
screwed.
-
I
made
a
promise,
a
promise
is
a
promise!
-
And
money
is
money!
Everyone
got
what
they're
after.
...I'm
paranoid
to
think
about
what
will
happen
once
the
train
is
at
the
customs.
-
Cheers.
-
Why
are
you
hiding?
...I
call
the
shots
around
here.
...get
in
here!
...I'll
keep
the
suitcase!
-
But
I
gave
everybody
their
share.
-
That's
it
guys,
that's
all
there
is.
-
It's
all,
I
swear
on
the
Bible.
-
Brother!
There
must
be
a
misunderstanding.
-
Thou
shall
die
now!
...filthy
rat!
-
Shame
on
you.
-
Here's
the
little
birdy.
-
My
suitcase!
...rot,
die!
You
filthy
fucktard!
...stop
jumping
around,
jackass!
...come
back
down
dammit!
...fuck
I
don't
need
your
shoes!
...so
be
it!
I'm
coming
for
you!
...it
is
time
...to
look
each
other
in
the
eye.
...just
you
and
me.
You
worthless
dumbass!
You
second
class
cum!
...there...finally!
...man,
this
is
way
too
high.
-
That's
Dadan,
thank
God!
-
Dadan,
It's
me.
Matko.
-
The
train
has
disappeared!
...didn't
it
cross
the
border?
...answer
me.
Where
are
my
17
wagons
-
It
crossed
the
border
30
minutes
ago.
-
Here?
Where?
-
I
can't
remember
anything.
Somebody
bloody
drugged
me.
-
Ah
come
on,
who
would
do
such
a
thing?
-
He
did.
This
cum!
...it
was
him.
-
My
Bulgarian
custom
officers
-
They're
lying.
They're
double
crossing,
-
A
train
rides
on
track,
...it
can't
just
have
gone
up
in
smoke,
-
No
way,
dammit.
-
My
dear
audience...
...after
a
triumphant
tour
in
...I'm
proud
to
present
to
you
in
your
quiet
riverside
village:
...an
act,
never
seen
before:
...to
pull
a
nail
from
a
beam
-
It
wasn't
an
ordinary
fight,
-
Which
one?
-
That
big
ol'
chunky
Bulgarian!
...I've
never
seen
a
man
that
big!
That
jerk
could
only
pass
the
-
What's
your
name?
-
A
warm
welcome
for
this
-
Your
moment
has
come!
Hit
it!
...the
great,
unforgettable,
...a
moment
you'll
remember
throughout
your
life!
-
I
proposed
an
honest
fight.
I've
said
it:
"honest
fight!"
...but
he
kicked
me
in
the
balls.
...I
grabbed
him
by
the
hair
and
whirled
...but
I
really
paid
attention
not
to
foil
our
plan
in
front
of
the
Customs
officers...
-
You'll
return
all
my
money
tonight.
...if
you
don't,
I'll
hang
you
by
the
balls
...so
you
can
get
your
head
aired
a
bit...
-
Awful...
-
So
how
will
it
be?
Will
I
have
the
money?
-
There's
a
bit
of
an
issue.
...three
wagons
were
supposed
to
be
mine.
-
I've
got
a
better
plan.
Yesterday
I
bought
your
father's
factory
-
The
cement
factory?
...ask
him
if
you
don't
believe
me.
-
But
it's
not
enough
to
cover
your
debt.
...I
have
an
even
better
plan!
Much
better!
-
You
have
a
marriageable
son.
-
We
arrange
a
big
fat
wedding
-
I'll
give
you
anything
you
want,
Dadan.
-
I'll
bet
on
the
nail.
-
Name?
-
Dadan,
don't
do
this
to
me,
you
can't
ask
such
as
huge
favour!
...your
sister
is
25,
my
son
17.
-
Younger
men
like
ripe
women.
-
That's
not
all,
Dadan.
-
What
else?
...she
looks
like
a
little
Smurf.
-
So
what?
A
diamond
is
small,
-
Final
bets
please!
Anyone?
-
Hands
off!
-
Do
we
have
a
deal?
Give
me
your
hand!
-
No.
I've
got
it
figured
now.
...I
know
who
stole
my
train
...and
who
messed
with
my
father!
-
Safet.
Kazatchok.
-
You
stole
from
my
father!
And
from
me
too!
-
This
way!
Bit
further
down!
-
Watch!
The
moment
of
truth
has
come!
-
I
love
the
huge
ass!
-
I
certainly
don't
envy
your
husband!
-
Attention!
...one,
two,
three...
freedom!
-
Oi!
What
are
you
doing?!
-
Is
this
seat
taken?
-
What
do
you
want?
-
Hey
you.
-
Get
me
an
ice
cream!
-
I'm
not
an
errand
boy.
-
Come
on,
you're
always
following
me
around,
-
Don't
you
think
so?
-
Out
of
the
way!
-
Strawberry
or
vanilla?
-
Strawberry
and
vanilla.
Four
servings.
-
You're
off?
...come
back.
...I've
got
to
tell
you
something.
...you're
in
a
hurry
or
what?
-
Shame
you're
getting
married.
...you're
a
bit
young
for
me
but
rather
handsome.
...I
could
fall
in
love
with
you...
...but
there's
no
point
when
you're
getting
married.
-
Married?
Who's
getting
married?
...I'm
only
thinking
of
you.
...you're
the
only
reason
for
my
presence
here.
-
Hardly
matters
now...
-
You've
been
fouled.
...I'm
way
too
young
to
get
married.
-
But
you
are
actually
engaged!
...I
overheard
your
father
and
Dadan
...they
agreed
last
night.
...it's
a
shame.
Here.
-
Woe
to
my
head...aaargh!
...Dadan
has
the
factory
now.
All
gone.
Whoosh!
-
And
now
he
wants
me
too.
-
He
got
the
train,
the
factory...
-
What
else?
...his
mother's
pussy.
-
The
Russians
are
here.
-
The
water
is
nice.
-
There's
something
else...
...that
Dadan.
-
he
wants
to
arrange
a
marriage
-
A
marriage?
-
For
our
child
Zare
and
his
sister.
...The
Lady-bird.
-
That
bawler,
the
midget?
...that
ass-plug
dwarf!
-
We
need
to
ask
for
assistance.
...he's
my
friend,
he'll
help
us.
-
It's
a
bit
late
for
that.
-
It's
a
bit
late
for
that.
...Grga
Pitic...is
dead.
-
Dead?
-
God
have
mercy
on
his
soul.
...but
I'll
have
one
now
-
Grandfather.
-
There's
my
grandson.
...ain't
he
handsome?
-
Grandfather,
I
got
you
some
oranges.
-
Now
be
nice
and
say
hello.
-
Hello,
nurse.
-
Have
you
seen
her?
-
The
girl.
-

No.
-
She's
the
nurse.
...they
call
her
Candy.
...those
boobies,
that
body.
...and
that
tiny
butt.
All
so
delicate.
-
You
know
for
me
it's
love
at
first
sight,
-
Love
at
first
sight?
Ridiculous.
-
The
son
of
your
deceased
friend
Zarija
...he
came
for
help.
...all
his
money
has
been
stolen.
...can
we
settle
this,
together
with
Little
Grga?
...we'll
skin
them
alive,
and
pump
them
full
of
lead.
-
Nah,
I
first
want
to
see
the
grave
of
Zarija.
-
As
you
will,
granddad.
...it
was
only
a
proposition.
-
Nobody
listens
to
me.
I'm
talking
to
you!
-
I'm
not
getting
married
this
way.
-
Miss,
let
me
take
measurements
please!
-
You're
my
greatest
enemy.
...you're
no
brother
to
me.
-
Must
our
parents
-
No,
no
no
and
no!!
I
don't
want
to
marry.
...I'm
not
getting
married.
Do
you
hear
me?
...I
am
not
doing
it!
Not
even
if
you
kill
me.
I'll
wait
for
my
true
love!
-
168.
...tell
me.
Who
is
it?
The
true
love?
-
I've
seen
him
in
my
dreams.
I'll
find
him
one
day.
...I
saw
him
a
hundred
times
in
my
dreams.
...I
know
his
eyes,
...He's
big,
very
big...
-
Which
big
man
would
want
you,
...an
ass-plug
like
yourself?
-
You'll
see,
he'll
come
one
day!
-
Breast,
88.
-
Safet.
...cool
her
down.
-
Stop
arguing
with
me
in
my
own
home!
-
Let
me
go!
-
Pull.
-
Aaaaye,
my
little
sister!
...what
are
you
doing?
Our
father
is
looking
down
upon
us!
-
Changed
your
mind
yet?
...I'll
turn
you
into
a
garden
gnome!
...son
of
a....go
on.
-
I
don't
want
to!
I'll
marry
the
man
I
love!
-
Do
you
even
have
a
soul?
-
They
can't
see
shit,
it's
cloudy!
-
Party!
-
Come
on!
Party
I
said!
-
That's
great
Dadan,
good
luck
to
you!
-
Move
over,
let
the
lady
sit.
-
Congratulations.
-
Do
you
want
something
to
drink?
-
Only
coffee?
-
You
need
any
help?
-
Ask
Matko,
that
dumbass.
...make
sure
there's
food,
I
don't
trust
him.
-
The
one
who
looks
like
a
vampire
...so
only
the
little
one
is
left.
...the
poor
Lady-bird
-
That
midget?
-
Yes,
in
her
bridal
gown.
...all
yours,
take
her!
-
Never.
-
I'm
here
for
business.
-
What
business,
Sujka?
-
You
marry
my
Ida.
...I
see
she
pleases
you.
-
You
won't
find
a
prettier
girl
...I
fed
her
from
her
birth.
...we've
been
everywhere.
...gave
her
medicines
...to
buy
her
Italian
clothes...
...we
went
to
Rome
and
Napels.
...I
showed
her
all
countries.
...in
the
end
we
went
to
Sweden.
-
I
know.
To
beg.
-
Still
better
to
beg
than
to
scavenge
in
the
rubbish.
-
How
much
do
you
want
for
her?
-
Give
me
35,000
marks.
-
Grandma.
-
15,000,
in
two
installations.
-
What
do
you
think
I
am?
-
17,000
in
three
parts?
...and
I
don't
want
see
you
ever
again.
-
She's
selling
you
like
cattle.
-
Never.
-
Carry
me.
...come
on,
carry
me!
...you're
really
handsome
you
know.
..and
now...kiss
me.
-
Damn
tie.
...save
me,
grandpa.
Don't
let
me
be
married.
...I'll
drink
his
blood.
-
Where
you're
off
to?
...let
go
of
that!
-
Aren't
you
ashamed
of
yourself?
Give
it
to
me!
-
Let
it
go!
You
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself!
...Relax.
Keep
your
cool!
-
Look
at
this.
Watch.
-
I'll
teach
him.
-
I
know
what
I
have
to
do.
-
I
don't
want
to.
...Listen,
listen,
let
me
tell
you
something!
...her
brother
Dadan...
...he
almost
killed
me.
He'll
exterminate
our
family.
He'll
drink
our
blood.
-
O
mirror,
the
dead
with
the
dead...
-
...the
living
with
the
living,
-
For
two
months.
Then
you
get
a
divorce.
-
...the
dead
with
the
dead...
-
I
said
no
and
that's
it!
...leave
me
be!
-
I'll
prevent
the
marriage
in
an
-
Zare.
-
Help
me
climb
up
or
else
I'll
beat
you
up!
-
Zare!
...damn
you
stupid
kid!
-
Where
is
he?
-
Who?
-
Aye,
you
keep
sitting
here
and
playing!
...don't
even
be
bothered
by
Dadan
making
mince
meat
out
of
all
of
us.
-
Where
is
my
son?
-
Where
is
he?
-
Get
out
of
there.
...out!
Hiding
is
futile.
...today's
his
wedding.
...you
disgraceful
lot!
-
The
dead
with
the
dead,
...the
dead
with
the
dead,
-
Granddad.
-
He's
not
breathing.
-
Grandpa
is
dead.
-
Did
you
hear
me?!
-
The
old
man's
dead!
...I
said,
grandpa
is
dead.
-
His
heart
stopped
beating.
-
Dead?
...did
you
have
to
die
on
the
day
your
The
day
he
marries...
-
Grandpa
wanted
to
saved
me...
...we'll
flee
together
after
the
mourning
ends.
-
Ah
now
I'll
need
to
get
a
new
costume,
shoes,
...wreaths
of
flowers,
candles...and
so
on...
-
Definitively
dead.
-
It's
okay...cry...
-
Ah
it's
you,
Matko,
you
womaniser.
...you're
early.
Eight
o'clock,
you
said.
...where's
the
son
in
law?
-
I
need
to
speak
with
you
immediately!
...it's
urgent.
-
Hope
it's
not
bad
news!
Today
I
only
want
to
hear
good
news.
-
I'm
listening.
-
My
father
is
dead.
-
Really?
-
My
condolences.
...a
wedding
and
a
funeral
don't
-
You're
right.
How
about
he
dies
in
three
days?
-
Three
days?
But
he
died
this
morning.
-
Who
says
so?
Who
knows?
-
I
know
it.
Zare...
...I
came
straight
to
you
to
tell
you!
-
I'll
mourn
with
you...
in
three
days.
...you're
a
wise
man.
...you're
not
postponing
the
wedding.
-
We'll
have
to!
-
You're
mad?
Should
my
father
turn
in
his
grave?
That's
what
you
want?
-
Of
course
not
Dadan.
-
Don't
tell
anyone
about
the
old
man.
...it
doesn't
matter
to
him
if
he
dies
on
...death's
forever.
...it
doesn't
matter
when
it
begins.
...did
you
hear
anything?
-
We
didn't
hear
anything.
-
Me
neither.
...get
the
guests
-
As
you
like,
Dadan.
-
He's
not
impressed.
-
Even
if
he
kills
us
and
places
us
dead
at
-
I
won't
do.
No
way.
-
Don't
be
daft.
He'll
rip
my
head
off!
...take
this...
...for
your
soul,
daddy.
...take
his
legs.
We
are
going
to
the
attic.
...turn
him
aside.
...bring
up
some
ice.
...hurry
up!
...quick!
...don't
do
this
to
me.
...put
his
legs
on
the
chair.
-
Get
the
grandchildren
of
Grga
Pitic
here!
-
I
left
six
messages.
...who
knows
where
they
are?
...daddy,
forgive
me.
-
Hold
it
above
the
bride.
-
Hold
it
above
her
head.
-
Get
away
you.
-
Take
the
child,
it
will
bring
you
luck.
-
My
dear
ones...This
is
the
most
beautiful
day...

of
your
lives.

She
said
'of
course
yes'

Let
her
say
it.
Yes
or
no.
-
I
want
an
answer.
-
So
yes
it
is.
...I
don't
see
any
legal
objection.
...I
now
declare
you
man
and
wife...
...in
my
presence...
...and
in
the
presence
of
this
crowd.
-
Hurry
up,
make
sure
everything's
okay.
-
I
don't
want
to.

You
know
my
hands
can
be
very
swift.
...thunder
in
one
hand,
-
Please
sign
this.
-
I
cannot
wait
on
his
wedding.
-
Why
do
you
care
about
his
wedding?
-
As
the
community's
administrative
officer...
...I
declare
married:
...Zare
Destanov
and
Afrodita
Karambolis.

Do
you
cry
for
him?
-
Then
cry.
...cry,
baby,
cry.
-
I
will
buy
you
a
convertible
...and
three
houses

girl,

if
you
were
mine,
...at
daytime
a
queen

Come
on!

Come
on,
hands
up
everyone!
-
Way
to
go,
Dadan.
...a
real
businessman
and
patriot.
-
Come
and
dance,
little
sister.
-
Fuck
off.
-
Ok,
let
her
go.
-
Respect
your
brother
in
law,
a
sensible
man.
-
Dance
with
your
brother,
it's
tradition.
-
I
don't
want
to.
-
Fine.
It's
your
wedding.
...freedom.
-
Daddy,
I
hope
you
see
this.
-
Let's
see
who
has
spent
the
most
on
gifts.
...a
portable
record
player...
...from
Nada
Adzovic.
...Zudija
Adzovic
donates
...Spaho
Ahmetovic,
pots
and
pans.
-
Keep
going,
pal!
-
Something's
amiss.
I
am
going
to
look
how
daddy
is
doing.
...stay
here
and
please
-
Nebojsa
Palanovic
-
Don't
show
the
people
you
are
crying.
-
Promise
you're
not
going
to
do
anything
stupid.
-
I
am
a
-
I
am
going
to
give
new
ice
to
daddy.
-
You
live
poorly.
Repair
your
roof.
-
There
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
roof.
-
It's
daddy
who
needs
to
be
repaired.
-
Wipe
your
nose.
...do
you
want
to
marry
someone
you
don't
love?
-
No.
-
Neither
do
I.
-
Do
you
love
her?
-
Then
help
me
run
away.
-
What?
-
There
is
a
big
shutter
near
the
table...
...on
the
floor...
...turn
left
at
the
oil-barrels.
-
Ahh,
what
a
joyful
moment,
fuck
me!
-
For
once
be
honest
with
me,
daddy.
...where
is
your
money
from
the
factory
sale?
-
Safet.
...bring
grenades!
-
What?
Grenades?
-
But
why?
Your
husband
can't
see
it.
-
You,
stop
wandering
around,
come
and
dance
instead!
-
Where
is
the
bride?
-
Everybody
listen.
...the
bride
is
gone!
-
Chief,
the
bride
is
gone!
-
Chief,
your
sister
is
gone.
-
What
sort
of
a
husband
are
you,
letting
your
wife
run
away?
-
My
dress!
-
Hey,
what's
happening?!
-
My
sister...
-
Stop
this,
sister!
...don't
worry.
...your
brother
will
not
abandon
you.
...I
will
find
the
guilty
one.
-
How
could
she
remove
her
dress
and
escape?
-
You
let
your
wife
escape?!
...you
son
of
a
bitch!
...what
have
you
done?
-
Has
your
sister
escaped?
-
Then
why
the
fuck
are
crying?
-
Stupid
junkies.
-
What
is
she
doing
here,
eh?
-
Searching
for
smurfette.
-
How
did
you
call
her?
-
Smurfette.
-
Shame
on
you.
-
You
don't
call
my
sister
smurfette.
...understood?
...do
you
even
know
who
I
am?
-
Leave
her
be,
she
knows
nothing!
...it's
not
her
fault,
-
She
does
know
something.
-
Stop
it.
Everybody
calls
her
-
Grandfather!
-
Grandfather?
You
are
unrealistic,
boy.
-
Grandfather!
-
Let
him
go,
he
doesn't
know
anything!
-
Don't
bother
your
grandfather,
he
is
dead.
-
Leave
him,
he
doesn't
know
anything.
-
Where
is
she?
-
Let
go
of
him,
bastard.
-
Where
is
she?
She
hasn't
vaporised.
-
Tell
me,
suckers.
Or
I
will
kill
you.
...you're
not
telling
me
where
she'd
gone?
-
Shall
I
shoot
him?
-
Dadan.
-
What
are
you
doing
here?
...I
have
important
news.
...my
balls
are
stuck.
-
Shame
on
you.
Repair
that
roof.
-
Who
cares?
I
have
seen
the
bride.
-
Where?
-
Safet.
-
Not
there,
friend.
This
way,
she
came
this
way!
...this
way!
-
Granddad,
do
you
hear
me?
-
Yes,
what's
the
matter?
-
We
should
turn
back.
-
We
need
some
things
sorted!
-
You
can
visit
his
grave
another
time.
-
No,
now.
-
You'll
get
a
stroke
in
this
heat,
Granddad!
...it's
a
hundred
degrees
out
there...
-
I'll
live,
plus,
Zarija
deserves
to
my
visit.
-
Ok
then.
...I
said
it
for
your
own
good.
-
Afrodita.
-
Sister.
...I
will
not
harm
you.
-
There
she
is.
-
My
sister.
-
All
ends
well.
-
She
is
not
here.
-
Maybe
she
is
in
the
woods.
-
What
a
shame
the
bride
runs
...everybody
will
talk
about
it
for
years.
...it's
my
shame
that
she'd
gotten
away.
-
I
will
find
her.
The
wedding
will
continue.
-
Chief,
it's
a
shoe.
-
Sister!
-
I
will
kill
you!
-
Wakey,
wakey!
We're
stuck!
...wake
up!
An
earthquake.
Earthquake!
-
Why
am
I
listening
to
you
in
the
first
place?
...where
did
you
get
that
stupid
map?
-
Hey,
Dad,
you're
asleep
or
what?
...I
think
we're
lost...
...what's
going
on
with
you?
...they're
gone!
-
This
is
my
destiny!
-
Why
destiny?
-
All
this.
I
will
still
marry
you.
-
Yes.
-
Who
could
have
thought
Ladybird
...I
don't
know
anyone
daring
to
go
up
against
Dadan...
-
She
is
indeed
brave.
-
I
am
so
afraid.
-
Of
what?
We'll
drown
this
filthy
son
of
a
bitch
in
his
own
shit!
-
Congratulations,
son.
Brilliant
idea.
-
I
thought
I
saw
the
devil
itself.
...but
it's
destiny.
-
And
my
other
shoe?
-
We
will
find
it.
-
Don't
be
silly.
-
I
was
looking
for
someone,
just
like
you...that
matches
my
taste!
-
Me
too.
-
I
looked
and
looked,
found
-
Me
too.
-
Let's
introduce
ourselves.
I
am
Grga.
-
Me
too.
I
mean,
I
am
-
We
must
celebrate,
-
My
sister...
-
Hey,
what
are
you
doing,
stop
it,
stop
it,
hey!
...it's
a
misunderstanding!
...you
silly
sod,
stop
shooting
like
that.
-
Excuse
me.
If
the
lady
has
any
debts
-
What
the
fuck
you're
waiting
for?
Take
action!
-
Grga.
-
Give
me
back
my
sister.
-
I'll
shoot
holes
in
you,
filth!
-
Fuck
off.
Come
here,
sis.
-
You're
a
shit
driver!
...you
lost
your
old
man,
you
lost
me...you
suck!
-
Look
what
I
have
got.
-
Don't
come
any
closer
...I
swear
to
God.
You
think
I'm
kidding?
-
Sister
in
law...
-
Who
are
they?
-
Don't
move!
-
She
is
my
sister.
Understand?
...and
she's
fled
her
own
wedding!
-
Oh
well,
she's
my
trouble
now
-
Shame
on
you.
And
you!
Give
me
back
my
sister!
-
She's
coming
with
me.
If
you
are
really
her
brother,
...I
want
to
marry
her
immediately.
-
She
just
ran
away
from
her
wedding.
-
You
can
run
away
from
a
fake
marriage,
-
Ewww,
what
a
sharpshooter.
-
Who
the
fuck
is
that?
-
Drop
the
guns!
-
You
call
this
driving,
idiot?
...Why
didn't
you
take
the
other
road?
-
Ok,
but
look
what
I
found.
-
Very
cute.
-
Chill
out!
...this
isn't
necessary.
-
How's
it
going,
consignor
Grga?
-
Is
it
you,
worthless
piece
of
shit?
...what
are
you
doing
here?
-
We
were
just
talking.
-
Talking
about
what?
...are
you
here
to
pay
off
your
debt?
-
Do
you
know
each
other?
-
Last
time
I
was
in
Italy...in
1982...
...he
was
a
newbie
in
my
gang.
...the
worst
kind.
...I
lost
the
landfills
in
Trieste
and
Udine
because
of
him.
-
So
don't
you
want
to
marry
her?
-
I
want
her.
-
A
bit
later
about
that
one...
-
Now.
-
And
you,
do
you
want
my
grandson?
-
Yes!
-
And
you
do
not
object
to
your
-
Of
course
not,
if
they
love
each
other.
-
What
the
heck's
making
you
unhappy?
...what's
wrong?
...ahh
the
cement
factory...
....and
the
three
wagons
of
petrol
he
nicked
from
you...
...you'll
pay
him
back,
understood?
...he
will
pay
at
once.
-
And
the
wedding
must
-
The
wedding
can
begin.
-
What
counts,
is
that
love
conquers
all.
-
Cheers!
-
Has
he
drank
it
yet?
-
My
beautiful
sisters.
-
You
will
swim
in
your
own
shit.
-
Do
you
need
anything,
uncle
Grga?
-
Have
fun,
I
am
going
visit
-
The
grave?
-
Where
is
it?
Tell
me.
...don't
you
want
to
drink
something
first?
...a
refreshment.
Eat
something
as
well.
...at
this
hour
there
are
...by
the
time
we
get
there,
-
As
you
wish.
...my
servants
will
bring
...but
where
should
the
grave
be?
-
Give
me
the
money.
-
Traitor.
-
It
was
only
ethical.
...I
think
we're
sorted
then.
...be
jolly.
Your
sister
is
happy,
so
is
my
son.
...like
our
benefactor,
uncle...
...What's
going
on?!
-
What's
the
matter?
-
What's
the
matter
with
him?
-
He
is
dead.
-
Really
dead.
-
No.
He
will
die
the
day
after
tomorrow,
...the
wedding
must
continue.
I
can't
-
Am
I
right?
-
Shall
we
put
him
in
the
attic?
-
We
told
his
grandchildren,
-
What
about
the
registrar?
-
He
must
cancel
the
first
wedding
-
Don't
worry,
-
Chill
out!
-
Goddammit...
-
Two
sixes.
-
A
bit
of
refreshments...
-
Duh,
that's
sweeeet!
-
The
more
natural,
the
sweeter.
-
Fifty
marks.
-
Look,
Dadan...
...500
horns
at
5
marks
is
2500
marks.
...I
know
someone
in
Düsseldorf
who'll
buy
the
whole
lot.
-
Are
you
crazy?
-
Wait,
Dadan.
...be
a
gentleman.
...my
stake
is
the
factory.
-
You
have
lost
that
one
already.
-
Ok,
I
still
have
a
house.
-
You
have
lost
that
one
too,
idiot.
-
But
you
do
have...
...a
nice
golden
tooth.
...that
will
be
the
stake.
500
marks,
ok?
-
What's
with
the
ice?
-
Get
lost.
-
Damned
black
cat.
-
I
am
soaked.
She
has
pissed
on
me.
-
Brother.
-
You're
alive?
-
I
was
told
you
were
dead.
-
They
have
lied
to
you.
-
Daddy.
I
am
glad
you
are
alive...again.
-
Of
course
you
are...
...dead
cows
can't
be
milked!
-
Granddad!
-
Your
father
is
alive.
-
I
will
now
explain
to
you
...the
holy
matremony...
...and
the
responsibility
of
marriage.
...I
wish
everything
will
be
beautiful
for
you...
...may
it
last
a
life
long...
...and
enjoy
each
others
company.
...think
of
it
as
this...what
happens
today...
...is
a
prelude
to
fulfilling
the
most
important
-
It's
kicking
in...
-
Be
jealous,
not
with
each
other,
...honor
it
and
protect
it
-
Consider
it...
-
When
you
died,
-
What
has
fallen?
-
Very
wise.
There
is
no
sun
here.
-
Forget
your
glasses.
Hurry
up.
-
Agreed?
-
I
agree.
But
don't
tell
that
to
anyone.
-
I
have
been
drinking
-
Don't
forget
the
accordion.
...in
it
you
will
find
enough,
-
Shit,
I
got
the
death
certificate
-
Are
you
crazy?
Junkie.
-
My
reputation...
...shall
I
call
the
police?
-
Here.
...everything
is
allright.
...the
signatures
please.
-
The
ladies
don't
marry
each
-
He
knows
his
job,
chill
out!
-
Keep
making
sure
it's
all
legal!
-
Do
you,
Afrodita
Karambolo...
...take
to
be
your
husband...
...Grga
Pitic
junior?
-
Yes.

Grga
Pitic
junior...
...take
to
be
your
wife

Yes.

Sister!
Someone,
help
me!

can't
work
like
this.
-
There
it
is.
-
It's
amazing.
-
Quickly!
-
We
are
not
married
yet.
-
Mr.
Dadan,
you're
in
deep
trouble.
-
You
always
spoil
everything.
-
I
haven't
had
this
much
fun
for
a
long
while!
-
I
can't
work
like
that.
-
It
can't
just
be
done.
It's
a
ceremony!
...hey,
I'm
an
official!
-
We
are
missing
the
boat.
Get
going!
-
The
boy
has
guts.
-
Zare,
my
grandson.
-
You're
just
a
kid,
what
do
you
want
from
me?
-
I
want
you
to
marry
us.
-
Don't
forget
the
accordion.
-
Come
back,
we
need
to
finish
the
ceremony!
-
Sit
down!
-
You
don't
have
any
witnesses.
-
Who?
-
Oi,
wait
for
me!
-
You
stink,
boss.
-
Ida,
will
you
take
Zare
as
your
husband?
-
Yes.
-
Of
course!

Children...
...have
a
good
journey!
-
Good
bye
granddad!
-
My
dear
friend...Shall
we
drink
to
it

Grandmother!
-
You
have
fooled
me,
daddy!
-
Don't
forget
about
your
loving
father!
-
It's
all
chaos!!
-
Nice
stuff.
-
Thanks,
daddy,
-
My
soul
is
on
fire.
-
Ah,
children...
-
Dadan,
brother.
-
Hey,
stop
it!
-
It
doesn't
smell
at
all!
I
don't
mind
it...
-
"Louis,
I
think
this
is
the
beginning
-
Jesus,
you
smell!
