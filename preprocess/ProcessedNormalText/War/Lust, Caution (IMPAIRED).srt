Next
round!
Now
that
we've
moved
to
paradise,
there's
nothing
to
eat.

Speaking
of
moving,
I
forgot
to
congratulate
you
on
Mr.
Liang's
promotion.
Can
you
even
call
that
a
promotion?
He
only
supervises
the
rations.
You
can't
even
get
rice
from
India
now.
Those
in
charge
of
rice
are
more
powerful
than
those
who
guard
the
treasury.
Mrs.
Yee
is
right.
Me?
I'm
not
a
living
Buddha.
But
you
should
listen
to
me.
If
he
takes
a
consignment,
he
won't
be
home
for
3
days.
You'll
be
free
then.
I
don't
have
the
time.
His
relatives
are
always
coming
around.
They
pack
the
place,
even
the
corridors.
I'll
take
that.

I
still
have
to
settle
their
meals.
It's
not
even
as
though
I'm
getting
paid
for
this.
Yeah.
Don't
mislead
Mrs.
Mak
into
thinking
government
officials
are
the
tiles
we're
playing
with
now.
Isn't
that
so?
The
Japanese
would
never
have
thought
that,
even
the
emperor
gets
henpecked.
Eat
while
it's
hot.
I
can't
eat
any
more,
I'm
getting
fat...
Everyone
hoards
up
stuff
now.
Since
we
can't
do
anything
else,
just
hoard
up
fat
then.
What
else
is
good
to
stock
up
on,
Mrs.
Yee?
You
know
my
husband
is
in
the
import
business.
I'll
take
that!

Even
though
Hong
Kong
has
fallen,
the
ships
still
need
to
call.
I'll
eat
that.

Western
medicine.
The
last
shipment
sold
out
very
quickly.
He
should
get
more
of
them.
I
heard
you
went
to
Shu
Yu
yesterday?
Yes,
with
some
others.
Mrs.
Mak
hasn't
been
there
before.
It's
embarrassing
that
I
haven't.
There're
two
new
branches
in
Hong
Kong.
The
Sichuan
and
Hong
Kong
chefs
couldn't
get
along,
and
besides
Hong
Kongers
can't
take
spicy
food.
Isn't
it
spicy?
Yes,
it
really
was.
9
Wan

2
Wan.
I'll
take
that.
Mrs.
Mak
didn't
go
yesterday?
She
hasn't
come
for
a
few
days.
I
had
things
to
take
care
at
home.
Since
you
had
enough
players,
I
decided
to
take
a
break.
An
excuse
to
hide
eh?
Who
was
it
who
said
she
wasn't
free
a
few
days
ago
over
the
phone?
That
day
doesn't
count,
I
went
to
fetch
Mrs.
Mak.
You
can
ask
her
if
you
don't
believe
me.
I
specially
chose
to
treat
you
to
a
meal
that
day,
Mrs.
Mak.
She
did
it
deliberately.
I'll
take
that
tile.
Do
you
still
have
more
of
those
stockings?
Yes,
but
I
gave
them
all
away.
If
you
want
I
can
bring
more
the
next
time.
Ok.
Goods
are
running
scarce
in
Shanghai.
There's
even
a
black
market
for
soap
and
toothpaste.
You
should
come
more
often.
There's
a
place
for
you
to
stay.
I
think
he's
had
enough.
The
Kempeitai

will
demand
for
him.
They
didn't
specify
whether
he
should
be
dead
or
alive.
Just
give
it
to
him.
How
will
you
account
to
Miura?
They're
investigating
the
arms
the
Americans
supplied
to
Chongqing.
I'll
meet
him
tonight.
His
secretary
called
to
say
today's
dinner
was
cancelled.
He
wants
you
to
report
directly
to
headquarters
tomorrow.
You're
not
returning
to
the
office
today?
I
still
have
an
appointment.
My
relatives
asked
someone
to
get
some
from
the
Russians.
Rings,
jewels
from
the
aristocracy.
They're
begging
for
cigarette
butts
on
the
streets.
Afraid
of
getting
fakes.
You
women
started
early
today.
That's
a
good
hand
you
have.
Mr.
Yee
is
here
to
show
his
support.
Sorry...my
turn?
That's
a
good
one
you
have.
How
many
carats
is
yours,
three
carats?
What
do
you
think
of
this?
I
tire
of
it.
It's
no
longer
fashionable,
I
was
thinking
of
getting
it
changed.
Pin
Fen
has
new
stock.
There's
a
new
five
carat
one.
It's
large,
but
not
as
bright
as
yours.
Why
didn't
you
call
me
then?
I
only
took
a
brief
glance.
Pin
Fen
has
some
stuff
that
can't
be
gotten
outside.
They
wouldn't
sell
that
fire
gem
to
me.

How
much
is
it
worth
now?
That
fire
gem
of
yours
is
ten
carats.
It's
not
as
though
it's
a
pigeon's
egg.
Gems
are
just
stones.
If
you
wear
such
large
jewellery,
you
can't
even
play
mahjong.
Nagging
at
me
even
though
you
wouldn't
buy
it
for
me.
Ah,
I
won!
Combo
win.

I
was
about
to
win
myself.
It's
all
Mr.
Yee's
fault,
for
saying
you
can't
play
mahjong
if
you
wear
jewellery.
He
did
it
on
purpose.
Thank
you
Mr.
Yee.
Mr.
Yee
should
treat
us
to
a
meal.
Sure,
where
do
you
want
to
go?
Shu
Yu.
Western
medicine?
Not
Shu
Yu,
let's
choose
somewhere
more
expensive.
Oh
dear,
I
forget.
I
have
an
appointment
at
three.
And
I
forgot
all
about
it.
That
won't
do,
who'll
play
then?
You
should
have
said
so
earlier!
I
need
to
discuss
something
with
someone.
And
I
forgot
all
about
it...
Why
don't
you
sit
in
for
me,
Mr.
Yee?
I'll
be
right
back.
And
my
luck
had
just
turned
for
the
better.
Not
today,
I
have
something
on.
I'll
play
overnight
with
you
ladies
some
other
day.
Mrs.
Mak
is
too
inconsiderate.
My
husband
has
some
money
owed
to
him,
it's
been
a
few
years
already,
the
debtor
finally
agreed
to
to
pay
up
a
portion.
Let's
ask
Mrs.
Liao
then.
Shen-ma,
could
you
call
Mrs.
Liao
over?
You
owe
us
a
treat.
Mrs.
Mak,
Mrs.Yee
says
you
can
use
the
car.
The
car
is
waiting
for
you.
I
really
couldn't.
Isn't't
Mrs.
Mak
going...?
Ok,
thank
you.
I'll
be
right
down.
There
are
less
cars
in
Shanghai
than
in
Hong
Kong.
Gas
is
expensive.
Even
those
who
have
cars
don't
drive
any
more.
Mrs.
Mak,
your
Shanghainese
is
very
good.
My
Mum
is
from
Shanghai.
When
I
was
young
some
relatives
of
mine
moved
over
to
Hong
Kong
when
the
war
started.
Really?
These
foreigners,
they
can
only
redeem
this
much
a
day.
They
can
only
get
hard
bread
to
eat.
Do
you
need
me
to
fetch
you
later?
No,
I
can
call
a
cab.
Coffee,
please.
Sure.
May
I
use
your
phone?
Of
course.
Strange,
did
I
call
the
wrong
number?
Hello.
Second
brother,
it's
me.
Yes?
I'm
at
the
Keseling
cafe
now.
Is
everything
alright
at
home?
Yes.
I'm
good,
just
too
busy
recently
to
call
back
home.
I'm
going
to
go
shopping
today.
I
have
a
date,
I'm
going
now.
Ok.
Well,
then,
there's
nothing
else.
I
know,
it'll
be
ok.
I'm
going,
goodbye.
We're
moving
out
now.
If
you
guys
win
we'll
marry
you!
I
didn't
say
I'd
be
the
one
marrying
them.
The
men
have
all
gone
to
war.
Who's
going
to
marry
this
truckload
of
girls?
I'm
not
going
to,
you
marry
him
then!
I
heard
from
teacher
that
Guangzhou
has
been
lost.
Will
it
be
safe
in
Hong
Kong?
I
never
thought
that
we'd
have
to
rely
on
the
Brits
to
protect
us.
Isn't
your
Dad
in
Britain?
Why
didn't
he
bring
you
with
him?
He
took
my
younger
brother.
When
my
Mum
died
he
said
he'd
take
me.
But
two
years
later,
war
broke
out.
I'm
not
going
back
again.
War
gave
me
the
chance
to
go
to
Hong
Kong.
I
want
to
go
overseas
and
see
the
world
outside.
See
you
by
the
pond
after
class
tonight.
Let's
go
back
to
our
apartment
together.
Ok.
Hey,
Lai
Shu
Jin!
I
was
just
looking
for
you.
Kuang
Yumin,
you
still
remember
me?
Yes,
I
saw
you
acting.
Lingnan
University's
Women's
Drama
Society.
We've
set
up
a
new
drama
society.
We're
auditioning
for
members
today.
But
the
women's
drama
society
has
never
collaborated
with
males.
Since
we're
borrowing
Hong
Kong
University's
premises
for
classes
and
we
have
a
lack
of
manpower,
we
should
work
together.
We
can
do
Ibsen's
"A
Doll
House"!
I
know
Nora's
lines
at
the
back
of
my
hand.
At
this
kind
of
time
who
has
the
mood
to
see
this
kind
of
bourgeoise
show?
We're
intending
to
stage
a
patriotic
play
to
raise
funds
for
the
war.
You
should
come
for
the
audition
tomorrow
too.
But
I'm
only
a
freshman,
I've
never
acted
before.
It
doesn't
matter.
Everyone
should
play
their
part
for
the
resistance
movement.
While
the
soldiers
are
fighting
on
the
frontlines,
the
Hong
Kongers
are
relaxing.
We
need
to
awaken
them
from
their
complacency.
What
a
typical
director,
he
doesn't
listen
to
anyone.
But
since
it's
the
resistance,
we
girls
can't
lose
out
to
the
guys.
I
just
can't
stand
the
thought
of
following
his
beck
and
call.
He's
quite
passionate
isn't
he?
Not
long
after
his
brother
graduated
from
the
military
academy,
he
got
killed
in
the
war.
So
his
family
wouldn't
let
him
join
the
army.
So
that's
why
he's
so
agitated.
I
don't
want
him
to
get
drafted
either.
I
return
myself
to
the
land
which
nurtured
me.
And
my
soul...
More
to
the
left,
more.
Ok,
that's
fine.
Let's
try
it
out.
What's
up?
My
Dad
got
married.
I'm
writing
a
letter
to
congratulate
him.
The
pre-stage
jitters
will
disappear
once
the
curtains
open.
Auntie
Zhao!
They
found
this
officer
behind
the
hills.
Xiao
Hong,
has
your
brother
come
home?
Shh!
Come
in
quickly.
My
son!
Quickly,
go
boil
some
water.
What
happened
to
you?
He's
an
army
officer,
not
your
son.
My
son
is
coming
home
tonight.
Coming
home
to
eat
dinner.
I
should
slaughter
a
chicken
for
him.
My
son
is
coming
back!
He's
coming
back
today!
My
son
is
coming
back.
My
son
is
coming
back.
Ever
since
she
knew
my
brother
died
on
the
warfront,
my
Mum
took
ill.
I
made
this
for
my
brother.
I
just
finished
knitting
it,
but
he'll
never
get
to
wear
it.
Please
have
it!
I
can't,
you
saved
my
life.
I
don't
have
anything
to
repay
you
with.
Saving
our
country
is
payment
enough!
Killing
the
enemy
is
taking
revenge
for
my
brother!
I
hate
myself
for
being
a
woman,
and
I
promised
my
brother
to
take
care
of
Mum.
I
want
to
set
his
mind
at
rest...
Your
brother...
He
was
the
same
age
as
you.
Ever
since
my
Dad
died,
he'd
been
taking
care
of
the
family.
He'd
work
faster
than
everyone
else.
Every
year
during
the
harvest,
he'd
help
others
after
harvesting
our
own
crops.
He
was
also
as
rugged
as
you.
I'd
always
follow
him
wherever
he
went.
He'd
always
say
Heaven
would
bless
the
honest
and
kind.
Our
family
had
our
hopes
pinned
on
him.
I'll
kowtow
to
you!
For
this
country,
for
my
dead
brother,
for
the
generations
of
people,
China
cannot
fall!!
China
cannot
fall!
China
cannot
fall!
China
cannot
fall!
China
cannot
fall!
Cheers!
This
calls
for
a
celebration!
That
was
really
great,
everyone
was
shouting
out:
"China
cannot
fall!"
China
cannot
fall!
600!
600
people
seated
in
the
audience.
And
those
standing
in
the
aisle
too!
Don't
underestimate
these
Hong
Kongers
eh?
When
we
performed
at
Lingnan,
we
never
had
such
an
enthusiastic
response.
What
we
staged
is
the
reality.
The
audience
can
emphasise,
so
naturally
they're
touched.
During
the
fund-raising
I
saw
many
people
tearing.
Cheers
to
everyone,
for
raising
this
sum
of
money,
and
doing
our
bit
for
the
war.
We
must
drink
to
our
heart's
content
tonight.
Let's
worry
about
the
nation
tomorrow.
Cheers,
bro!
I
have
an
idea,
listen
to
me.
We
should
sell
tickets.
And
write
on
the
door:
"While
stocks
last!"
If
it's
you,
it's
more
like:
"It's
hard
to
sell
even
one
ticket"
Here,
give
me
the
drinks.
Careful!
Cheers
to
our
leading
man
and
lady!
Our
ticket
sales
depend
on
her!
To
our
leading
man
and
lady!
I'm
not,
I'm
not.
We're
the
peach
blossoms

of
today,
The
pillars
of
society
tomorrow,
We're
singing
together
today,
Saving
the
people
tomorrow
on
a
giant
wave,
A
giant
wave,
continuously
expanding,
Classmates,
my
dear
students,
let
your
strength
prop
up
the
rise
and
fall
of
this
world,
A
giant
wave,
a
giant
wave,
Hurry!
To
the
top!
Have
you
lighted
it?
It
won't
do
if
peformers
don't
smoke.
Try
it,
it'll
come
in
useful
during
acting.
Wong
Chia
Chi
took
a
blow,
who
wants...
Gimme!
Let
me
take
a
drag!
Thank
you.
Why?
Wong
Chia
Chi.
Come
up!
I
met
a
fellow
villager
from
my
hometown
called
Tsao
De
Xi.
He
went
to
the
same
school
as
my
brother,
so
we're
familiar
with
each
other.
I
heard
he's
an
Assistant
Officer,
working
for
the
guy
in
charge
of
the
"Peace
Exercise".
His
name
is
Yee.
He's
Wang
Jingwei's
aide,
in
charge
of
espionage
and
spying.
He's
now
in
Hong
Kong.
Wang
Jingwei's
runs
the
"Peaceful
Exercise",
but
he's
just
a
lackey
of
the
Japanese.
He's
a
traitor
who
betrayed
our
country.
Wang
is
now
accumulating
troops.
Hong
Kong
is
under
Yee's
purview.
This
Tsao
guy
I
met...
This
is
a
chance.
What
chance?
This
isn't
theatre.
No
matter
how
much
we
trade
on
our
audience's
tears
and
shout
our
voices
hoarse,
it's
incomparable
to
killing
a
real
traitor.
We
can
do
it
this
holidays
so
the
school
won't
find
out.
We
need
to
disguise
ourselves
and
think
of
a
way
to
infiltrate
the
Yee
household.
I'll
get
a
favour
from
Old
Tsao
and
get
him
to
introduce
us.
And
then
we'll
get
guns,
But
which
of
us
knows
how
to
kill
a
person?
We've
only
killed
people
on
stage.
When
you
see
a
traitor
in
front
of
your
eyes,
you'll
know
that
killing
isn't
difficult
at
all.
It's
only
a
matter
of
how
many,
how
fast.
This
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death,
I
want
everyone
to
consider
it
carefully.
If
you're
in,
then
let's
make
this
a
big
one.
Knives
together,
let's
not
waste
our
youth,
and
slay
one
of
Wang
Jingwei's
lackeys!
I'm
in!
Count
me
in.
Then
we'll
too...
I
don't
want
to
force
anyone.
I'm
in
too.
'lil
un,
I
didn't
expect
you'd
come
find
me.
We
haven't
met
since
we
left
our
hometown.
Less
talk.
Cheers!
Drink
up.
I
should
also
thank
Brother
Tsao.
From
now
on
you
must
take
care
of
us.
Sure,
sure
sure.
Here's
one
to
you!
Brother,
can
you
see
if
you
can
help
us?
Can
you
help
us
find
work?
It's
tough,
but
let
me
think
of
something.
Where's
Liang
Junsheng?
He's
still
up
there.
What's
he
doing?
We
only
have
enough
for
Tsao.
Maybe
he
can
get
more
information.
Just
on
those
few
glasses
of
cat's
piss?
The
caucasians
have
all
gone
on
holiday.
We
can
use
the
second
floor
for
two
months.
Where'd
you
get
the
money
from?
My
Dad
left
me
some
money
in
Hong
Kong
in
case
of
emergencies.
I
didn't
ask
you
to
get
something
so
luxurious.
If
you
want
Auyang
to
be
Mr.
Mak,
a
businessman
and
Wong
Chia
Chi
to
be
Mrs.
Mak,
a
rich
housewife,
this
is
the
kind
of
place
they
should
live
in!
Let's
decorate
this
place
and
get
some
furniture.
And
get
a
maid.
Does
Mr.
Mak
need
a
moustache?
Hold
on.
Don't
use
my
best
tie
to
wipe
your
mouth
with!
This
isn't
a
rehearsal,
there
won't
be
a
second
chance.
Remember
your
own
roles.
Don't
say
what
you're
not
supposed
to
say.
You
too...
They're
here!
Mr.
Mak,
Mrs.
Mak.
This
is
Mr.
Mak's
cousin,
a
friend
from
my
hometown,
Kuang
Yumin.
This
is
Mr.
Yee,
and
Mrs.
Yee.
You
accompany
them,
I'll
take
my
leave
first.
Sorry
about
making
you
drive
all
the
way
here
to
get
me.
Old
Tsao
said
you
were
familiar
with
Hong
Kong.
If
not
we'd
have
used
my
husband's
car.
It's
no
problem,
it's
along
the
way.
Mrs.
Yee,
do
you
want
to
visit
Chung
Wan?
Though
we've
been
in
Hong
Kong
for
a
few
months
already,
the
only
places
we
know
are
Chung
Wan
and
Repulse
Bay.
How
about
Tsim
Sha
Tsui
then?
We
can
take
a
stroll
there
too.
Sure.
To
Tsim
Sha
Tsui,
Queen's
Harbour.
Can
you
drop
us
off
before
you
return
to
the
office?
It
won't
matter
if
we
make
a
slight
detour
right?
I
wouldn't
want
to
inconvenience
Mr.
Mak's
official
business.
It's
a
family
business,
it's
all
right.
What
line
are
you
in,
Mr.
Mak?
Export
trading.
We
also
do
importing.
Mrs.
Yee,
where
you
live
is
pretty
good.
When
we
were
looking
for
a
house,
did
we
look
here?
It's
just
a
rental.
Once
war
broke
out
on
the
mainland,
we
moved
here
hastily.
Mrs.
Mak,
were
you
born
here?
I
married
here,
my
Mum's
hometown
is
in
Guangzhou.
My
Mum
is
from
Shanghai.
Then
your
Shanghainese
must
be
good.
I
can
speak,
but
not
well.
I've
forgotten
it
all.

My
hometown
is
Anhui.
My
Shanghainese
isn't
too
good
either.
Thanks,
sorry
for
bothering
you,
and
helping
me
carry
my
stuff.
No,
I
should.
You're
welcome,
since
he's
my
husband's
cousin.
He
also
just
arrived
in
Hong
Kong.
We
brought
him
along
to
see
the
sights.
What
do
you
do
in
Guangzhou?
I
teach,
in
an
elementary
school
in
the
village.
As
expected,
you
have
a
scholarly
air.
Either
a
college
student
or
a
teacher.
Mrs.
Yee,
you
have
a
good
eye.
Didn't
you
see
those
plainclothes
bodyguards?
There's
no
way
we
can
make
a
move
on
him
at
his
own
place.
Whenever
he
goes
out
there're
at
least
a
few
bodyguards
by
his
side
in
addition
to
the
chaffeur.
Even
if
we
get
him
out
there're
at
least
three
people
we'll
have
to
deal
with.
We
need
at
least
two
guns.
But
it's
still
better
than
attacking
him
at
home.
Be
more
patient,
we're
already
on
track.
Mrs.
Yee
has
a
good
impression
of
Wong
Chia
Chi.
She's
already
arranged
a
second
meeting.
Sorry,
I'm
tired.
Can
I
come
in?
Come
in.
I
pressed
the
tailor
to
hurry.
Thank
you.
What
does
Yee
look
like?
I
only
got
a
glimpse,
he
wasn't
what
I
expected.
Our
cook,
he
just
left
like
that.
He
didn't
take
anything,
but
the
man
just
disappeared.
So
we
moved
to
the
Ban
Dao
hotel.
It's
already
five
days,
and
we
don't
dare
to
go
back...
My
husband
says
it
isn't
safe,
so
we
need
to
find
somewhere
else
to
stay.
You
can't
trust
the
people
here.
These
Cantonese,
I
can't
catch
a
word
of
what
they're
saying.
Exactly,
I'm
quite
irritated.
Where
can
I
find
a
cook,
who
can
whip
up
some
decent
Shanghainese
dishes
now?
I
know
there's
a
place
in
Hong
Kong,
which
serves
decent
Shanghainese
food.
They
have
good
fried
shallot
carp
and
drunken
chicken.
Then
bring
us
there!
Hey,
Old
Yee,
Mrs.
Mak
just
said
there's
a
good
Shanghainese
restaurant
in
Hong
Kong.
Old
Yee
is
a
fussy
eater.
He
compalains
no
matter
how
good
the
resturant
is.
Really?
Which
one?
It's
the
Zhu's,
at
Kowloon.
It's
the
main
branch
of
the
Shanghai
Restaurant
in
Hong
Kong.
I
think
I've
heard
of
it.
I'll
be
back
late
tonight.
Don't
remember
we
have
guests
tomorrow.
Good
night.
We're
not
invited
tomorrow?
He
didn't
tell
me
who
the
guest
is.
It
must
be
Wang
Jingwei's
wife,
Chen
Bijun.
They're
forming
a
new
government.
They
sent
for
Old
Hsiao
already.
That
means
Mr.
Yee
is
going
to
be
promoted
isn't
he?
As
she
said...

Why're
you
so
late?
Was
playing
mahjong.
Sorry,
I
lost
again.
What
about
Mr.
Yee?
Barely
saw
him
for
a
minute.
He
left
and
didn't
come
back.
Hey,
move
aside,
I'm
bushed.
Hey,
I
killed
a
beer
bottle.
It's
already
been
a
month.
What's
so
great
about
shooting
one
or
two
beer
bottles?
You
might
as
well
shoot
me!
To
spare
my
Dad
from
doing
the
job.
The
house,
car,
losing
at
mahjong.
Shopping
for
expensive
stuff,
buying
a
whore
for
you,
Are
we
here
on
holiday
or
to
kill
a
traitor?
How
many
Dads
do
you
think
I
have?
Wong
Chia
Chi
needs
expensive
jewellery,
and
you
want
to
be
a
Resistance
hero,
What
about
me?
I'm
a
chauffeur
in
the
day
and
a
sentry
at
night.
My
Dad
has
been
asking
around.
He
thinks
I've
been
fooling
around
in
Hongkong.
He
wants
to
break
off
all
ties
with
me.
Why
don't
you
guys
think
about
that!
We
have
guns.
Why
don't
we
kill
some
easy
ones
first?
If
not
school
will
be
starting
soon.
Everyone's
here
voluntarily.
We
can't
blame
it
all
on
Kuang
Yumin.
I
know
we're
in
financial
difficulties.
I
should
have
planned
for
this.
I
admit
we
don't
have
any
experience.
But
we
committed
ourselves
to
this.
We
finally
inflitrated
the
Yee
household
after
so
much
effort.
We
can't
just
give
up
now.
The
guards
are
now
familiar
with
me.
I'll
find
a
chance
to
do
it
myself.
Don't
worry,
I'll
take
care
of
the
consequences.
Don't
be
dumb,
you
think
you
can
do
it
alone?
That's
my
problem.
My
documents
are
in
the
study.
Mr.
Yee.
Mrs.
Mak.
The
car
broke
down
halfway.
And
it
started
raining.
Send
Mrs.
Mak
in.
Hongkong's
so
humid.
You
can
wring
out
water
even
in
a
handshake.
Yeah,
even
Shanghai
isn't
that
bad.
I'm
still
not
used
to
it
even
now.
Mrs.
Hsiao.
I
thought
you
wouldn't
be
coming
because
of
the
weather.
Why
are
you
back?
Rain's
too
heavy,
I
changed
my
plans.
Mrs.
Mak,
Mrs.
Zhu,
you're
here?
We're
waiting
for
Mrs.
Hsiao.
Just
nice,
we
need
one
more
player.
I
still
have
something
to
do.
Why
don't
you
just
play
for
a
while?
You
haven't
played
for
ages.
Mr.
Yee,
Mrs.
Yee's
getting
angry.
Ok.
Mr.
Yee
liked
the
material
we
chose
that
day.
He
didn't
like
the
last
one.
Is
there
any
tailor
you're
familiar
with?
Yes,
I
know
of
one,
he's
quite
good.
We
make
our
suits
and
dresses
there.
Want
to
try
making
one
there?
I'll
leave
it
to
you.
But
it's
the
peak
season
now.
They're
busy
with
tourists'
requests.
Will
it
take
a
few
months?
No,
not
that
long.
We're
old
customers
anyway.
I
can
hurry
him.
When
Mr.
Yee
is
free,
Mrs.
Yee
can
give
me
a
call.
Mrs.
Mak,
I
have
your
phone
number.
We
can
probably
get
a
discount
if
we
make
one
or
two
more.
Mr.
Yee
prefers
UK
imports
they
don't
give
discounts
for
those.
Really?
I've
won!
Your
luck
today
is
pretty
good.
I
didn't
even
realise
I'd
won.
The
God
of
Fortune
must
have
come.
Ah,
Mr.
Yee.
I
recognised
your
voice.
It'll
complement
your
face
more
if
the
collar
is
narrower.
Yes,
a
smaller
collar
looks
better.
Shorten
the
sleeves
a
little
more.
I
said,
you
should
shorten
the
sleeves.
It'll
make
you
look
more
sprightly.
I'll
leave
it
to
you.
This
is
a
more
modern
design.
The
collar
looks
good.
Your
dress
is
ready.
I'll
try
it
on.
Go
and
eat
first,
don't
wait
for
me.
Does
Mrs.
Mak
often
make
her
clothes
here?
Yes.
She's
a
frequent
customer
of
ours.
It's
too
fitting,
I
can't
breathe
properly.
Mrs.
Yee
originally
chose
this
one.
But
she
didn't
want
it
so
I
took
it.
I'll
leave
it
as
it
is
then.
I'll
take
it
off.
Wear
it.
Alright.
Is
Mrs.
Yee
ok?
Old
Cao
will
bring
her
to
the
doctor.
She
said
she
had
a
headache
when
we
were
about
to
leave.
Must
be
the
mahjong.
My
husband
doesn't
like
me
to
play
mahjong
too.
I
said,
men
have
many
ways
to
entertain
themselves
outside.
But
for
women,
we
can
only
shop
and
play
mahjong.
Mahjong
isn't
that
bad,
at
least
we
stay
at
home.
When
I
called
today
did
I
disturb
you?
My
husband
isn't
home,
he
went
to
Singapore.
So
his
friends
came
over
to
accompany
me
in
case
I
was
bored.
But
in
fact
he's
getting
them
to
keep
watch
on
me.
I
had
an
excuse
to
escape
because
you
called.
Really?
I
don't
mind
going
out
alone
when
I'm
free.
My
husband
isn't
interested
in
the
things
I
like.
What
do
you
like?
Watching
movies.
He
doesn't
want
to
go
so
I
go
alone.
He's
always
talking
business
with
those
friends
of
his.
They're
not
interested
in
the
movies
at
all.
I
don't
watch
movies
too.
Mr.
Yee
is
a
busy
man.
Only
frivolous
people
watch
movies.
No,
that's
not
it.
I'm
afraid
of
the
dark.
Will
you
drink
some?
I'll
drink
a
little
with
you.
We
don't
know
many
people
in
Hongkong,
so
we're
always
troubling
you.
It's
trivial
stuff,
you
don't
have
to
stand
on
airs.
If
you're
observant,
nothing
is
trivial.
There
don't
seem
to
be
many
customers
here.
It's
because
their
food
sucks.
Sorry.
But
it's
convenient
to
talk
here.
No
one
will
disturb
you.
Is
Mr.
Mak
busy
with
his
work?
I
don't
even
know
what
he's
busy
about.
He
went
to
Singapore
in
the
past
two
days.
But
as
long
as
the
men
don't
come
home,
everything
else's
fine.
Isn't
it?
What
kind
of
business
does
Mr.
Mak
do?
Import
and
export.
If
you're
so
interested
in
Mr.
Mak,
I'll
bring
him
along
the
next
time.
At
least
men
have
more
conversation
topics
among
themselves.
With
women
they
can
only
talk
about
trivial
matters.
To
me,
a
chance
to
talk
relaxedly
like
this
is
hard
to
come
by.
The
people
I
associate
with
are
those
with
high
reputations.
They
talk
all
the
time
about
politics.
The
fate
of
generations
hang
by
their
mouths.
It
doesn't
matter
what
their
views
are.
In
all
of
their
eyes
I
see
the
same
thing:
What?
Fear.
What
about
you?
You're
different
from
the
rest.
You're
not
afraid,
are
you?
What
about
you?
You're
smart,
but
you're
not
very
good
at
mahjong.
Yeah,
I
always
lose.
I've
only
won
you
before.
Your
suit
is
ready,
do
you
want
me
to
collect
it
for
you?
I'll
call
you.
I
have
an
appointment
later.
I
still
have
some
time,
so
I'll
send
you
home
first.
Is
it
convenient?
Yes.
They're
here!
Turn
off
the
lights,
guard
the
outside.
Thanks.
I'll
send
you
to
the
door.
You
don't
have
to.
Wait
for
me.
They're
coming!
Turn
off
the
lights!
They're
about
to
come
in.
Don't
blame
me
if
you
miss
your
appointment.
Too
bad
you
have
an
appointment...or,
you
can
send
the
car
away.
Come
up
for
some
tea.
Give
me
a
stiff
drink.
He's
very
careful,
when
we
were
at
the
tailor's
he
sent
away
Old
Hsiao
and
the
bodyguard.
That
means
even
Old
Hsiao
isn't
someone
he
trusts.
No
worries,
just
do
the
same
thing
the
next
time
and
get
him
into
the
house,
we'll
get
him
with
one
bullet.
He's
wary
of
"Mr.
Mak",
so
he
won't
come
in.
He
meets
at
very
obscure
places.
Possibly
Old
Hsiao
might
not
even
know
of
them.
Is
he
interested...
Mr.
Mak
isn't
pleased.
Not
yet.
But
I
know
his
intentions.
Otherwise
he
wouldn't
have
sent
me
to
the
door.
It's
just
that
he's
too
afraid
to
come
in.
He
was
dallying
by
the
entrance.
He
said
he
wanted
to
see
me
again.
I
originally
thought
of
meeting
at
the
cinema.
Since
it'll
be
easier
to
make
an
escape
there.
But
he's
a
really
careful
man.
He
said
he
wouldn't
go
to
dark
places.
If
he
calls
again
it'll
be
serious.
I'll
have
to
agree
to
be
his
mistress.
And
then?
Have
you
guys
thought,
what
next?
Do
you
know
how
to
do
it?
Between
a
man
and
a
woman...?
You've
all
discussed
this
before
already?
Who?
Only
Liang
Junsheng
has
experience.
With
a
whore?
Do
you
want
to
drink?
No
need.
The
lights.
You
seem
to
be
more
responsive
today.
I
don't
want
to
discuss
this
with
you.
We
cooked
some
porridge.
Hello?
Mrs.
Mak,
how
are
you?
I
called
you
two
days
ago.
But
you
weren't
in.
I
wanted
to
ask
if
you've
tailored
the
clothes?
You're
not
having
it
done
any
more?
Why?
Going
back
to
Shanghai?
Well,
congratulations
then.
I'll
go
over
right
now.
You
haven't
called
for
the
past
few
days.
So
I
thought
I'd
drop
by.
I'll
go
to
the
airport
tomorrow
then.
I
should
really...
I
should
really
see
you
off,
right?
You're
leaving
just
like
that?
I
see.
Give
Mr.
Yee
my
regards.
Bon
voyage.
Goodbye.
Moving
house?
Hope
I'm
not
disturbing.
Huang,
you're
no
longer
driving?
A
mover
now
are
you?
What
are
you
doing
here,
Cao?
To
pay
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Mak
a
visit.
And
their
cute
friends.
What
do
you
want?
Right
from
the
start
I
knew
something
was
wrong.
I
kept
quiet
about
it
so
I
could
see
what
you
were
up
to.
So
Mr.
Mak
is
from
Lingnan
University.
Cao,
don't
do
anything
reckless.
Mr.
Yee
didn't
take
me
to
Shanghai.
Why
don't
I
repent
my
ways?
I
know
a
lot
more
than
you
guys.
Your
superiors
must
know
that
I'm
more
valuable
than
you
guys.
How
much
money
do
you
want?
I'd
say
at
least
10
gold
taels.
And
that
doesn't
include
Mrs.
Mak's
price.
I'm
thinking
Mr.
Yee
would
pay
even
more
for
her.
You're
asking
for
it!
You
really
have
it
going,
bro.
I
didn't
know
you
were
a
spy.
You
should
be
the
one
helping
me
out.
Instead
why
are
you
making
use
of
me?
Even
though
we're
fellow
villagers.
You
helped
a
traitor!
You
should
have
known
what
was
coming
for
you!
He's
not
dead
yet.
You're
back?
Morning.
You're
back.
Morning.
Aunt,
I'm
back.
Has
your
father
written?
I'll
check
the
mail
later.
Aunt,
I'm
going
to
school.
You're
still
letting
her
study?
I
sold
off
the
house
her
father
left
for
her.
In
return
I
agreed
to
let
her
finish
her
studies.
I'm
a
person
who
keeps
her
word.
It
is
the
time
for
victory!
In
the
past
500
years,
having
endured
the
tyranny
of
Imperialism
the
whole
of
Asia
has
now
broken
free
and
achieved
freedom.
Asia
is
now
returning
to
Asians'
hands!
For
every
day
it
is
not,
we
will
fight
unceasingly
for
freedom!
You'd
never
have
expected
that
our
actions
in
Hongkong
were
being
observed
secretly.
After
you
left
that
night,
they
appeared
and
cleaned
up
the
mess.
They
smuggled
us
out
of
Hongkong.
Who's
"they"?
They're
from
Chongqing,
they're
the
ones
who
assassinated
the
Shanghai
mayor.
Now
you
know
how
childish
we
were.
It
was
really
ridiculous.
Yes,
especially
me.
I
was
just
dumb.
It
was
my
fault.
We
all
paid
a
price.
How's
everyone?
They're
all
still
around.
Where?
A
few
places.
It's
not
convenient
to
say.
I've
been
looking
for
you.
I
didn't
go
back
to
school.
I
later
taught
language
lessons
at
a
community
centre.
