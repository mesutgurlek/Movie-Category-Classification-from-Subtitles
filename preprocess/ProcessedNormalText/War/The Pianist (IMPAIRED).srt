Mr.
Szpilman?
Hello.
I
came
specially
to
meet
you.
I
love
your
playing.
Who
are
you?
My
name's
Dorota.
I'm
Jurek's
sister.
You're
bleeding!
It's
nothing.
Come
on,
Dorota.
You
can
write
him
a
fan
letter
later.
This
isn't
the
best
time.
Jurek,
where
have
you
been
hiding
her?
I
don't
know
what
to
take.
You
always
take
too
much.
How
many
suitcases
are
you
taking?
What
do
you
think?
Should
I
take
Uncle
Szymon's
portrait?
Take
it,
don't
take
it.
Take
what
you
like.
Can't
you
see
I'm
worried
sick?
Oh,
he'll
come
home.
He'll
be
all
right.
You
have
another
case
just
like
this.
Mama,
Wladek's
home.
Oh,
thank
God!
Wladek--
You're
wounded?
No,
no,
a
little
cut.
It's
nothing.
I've
been
worried
sick.
I
told
her
not
to
worry.
You
had
your
papers
on
you.
If
you'd
been
hit
by
a
bomb,
they'd
know
where
to
take
you.
Henryk,
don't--
Don't
say
things
like
that.
God
forbid,
God
forbid.
Papa,
Wladek's
home.
What
did
I
tell
you?
What
are
you
doing?
Anybody
seen
my
hat
with
the
wide
brim?
They
bombed
us.
We're
off
the
air.
Warsaw's
not
the
only
radio
station.
Pack,
darling.
Get
your
things.
Pack.
Where
are
we
going?
Out
of
Warsaw.
Out
of
Warsaw?
Where?
You
haven't
heard?
Heard
what?
Haven't
you
seen
the
paper?
No.
Where's
the
paper?
I
used
it
for
packing.
She
used
it
for
packing!
The
government's
moved
to
Lublin.
All
able-bodied
men
must
leave
the
city,
set
up
a
new
line
of
defense.
There's
hardly
anybody
left
in
this
building,
only
the
women.
The
men
have
gone.
What
do
you
think
you'll
do
while
setting
up
your
new
line
of
defense?
Wander
around
lugging
your
suitcases?
Pack,
Wladek.
I'm
not
going
anywhere.
Good.
I'm
not
going
anywhere
either.
Don't
be
ridiculous.
We've
got
to
keep
together.
Look,
look.
If
I'm
going
to
die,
I
prefer
to
die
in
my
own
home.
I'm
staying
put.
God
forbid.
I've
got
something.
Listen.
Received
from
the
BBC
in
London.
The
British
government,
having
received
no
reply...
to
the
ultimatums
presented
to
the
German
government,
has
declared
war
on
Nazi
Germany.
Ho-ho!
That's
wonderful,
wonderful!
It
is
expected--

Within
the
next
few
hours,
France
will
make
a
similar
declaration.
Poland
is
no
longer
alone.

Wonderful,
wonderful!
Mama,
that
was
a
great
dinner.
Yes,
it
certainly
was.
When
there's
something
to
celebrate,
you've
got
to
make
an
effort.
Here's
to
Great
Britain
and
France.
I
told
you.
Didn't
I
tell
you?
All
will
be
well!
Oh!
Five
thousand
and
three.
Huh?
Is
that
all?
Yes!
-Five
thousand
and
three
zlotys.
All
we
got
left.
-It's
3,003
zlotys
too
much.
Look.
"Re:Further
restrictions
regarding
liquid
assets:
Jews
will
be
allowed
to
keep
a
maximum
of
2,000
zlotys
in
their
homes."
What
are
we
supposed
to
do
with
the
rest?
Deposit
it
in
a
bank.
A
blocked
account.
Banks?
Who'd
be
stupid
enough
to
deposit
money
in
a
German
bank?
We
could
hide
the
money.
Look
here.
We
can
hide
the
money
under
the
flowerpot.
No,
we'll
use
tried-and-tested
methods.
Know
what
we
did
in
the
last
war?
Eh?
We
made
a
hole
in
the
table
leg,
and
hid
the
money
in
there.
-
And
suppose
they
take
the
table
away?
-
What,
take
the
table
away?
The
Germans
go
into
Jewish
homes
and
take
what
they
want.
Furniture,
valuables,
anything.
Idiot.
What
would
they
want
with
a
table?
A
table
like
this?
What
on
earth
are
you
doing?
Listen.
Look.
This
is
the
best
place.
No
one
will
think
oflooking
under
the
flowerpot.
No,
no,
no.
Listen.
I've
been
thinking.
Really?
That's
a
change.
You
know
what
we
do?
We
use
psychology.
We
use
what?
We
leave
the
money
and
the
watch
on
the
table.
And
we
cover
it,
in
full
view.
-
Are
you
stupid?
-
The
Germans
will
search
high
and
low.
They'll
never
notice.
That's
the
stupidest
thing
I've
ever
seen.
Of
course
they'll
notice
it.
Look
here.
-
Idiot.
-
And
you
call
me
stupid.
-
That
is
very
good.
-
This
will
take
hours!
-
We're
not
in
a
hurry.
-
It
won't
take
hours.
How
will
you
get
them
out?
Tell
me
that!
-
Pull
each
one
out
individually!
-
No
one
listens
to
me.
Quiet,
please.
Quiet!
Order,
order,
please!
She's
a
lawyer,
she
likes
order.
Just
listen!
The
watch
we
put
under
the
flowerpots
and
the
money
we
stuff
in
the
violin.
Will
I
still
be
able
to
play?
Well,
you'll
find
out.
Jurek?
It's
Wladek
Szpilman.
How
are
you?
Fine,
fine.
We're
fine,
thank
you.
And
you?
Fine.
We're
fine
in
the
circumstances.
I
guess
what
you
called
about--
There's
nothing
we
can
do.
They
won't
reopen
the
station.
Yes,
I
know.
But,Jurek--
Not
even
music.
Nothing.
No
radios
for
the
Poles.
Jurek--
I'm
sure
you'll
find
work,
a
pianist
like
you.
Maybe,
maybe
not.
But--
Listen,
don't
be
offended,
but
I
didn't
call
to
discuss
my
future
career.
I
nagged
Jurek
for
weeks
and
weeks.
At
last
he
gave
in
and
said,
"All
right,
come
with
me
tomorrow."
So
I
came,
and
they
bombed
the
station.
Meeting
you
like
that
was
absolutely
wonderful.
Really?
Yes.
It
was--
It
was
unforgettable.
I've
always
loved
your
playing,
Mr.
Szpilman.
Call
me
Wladek,
please.
No
one
plays
Chopin
like
you.
I
hope
that's
a
compliment.
Of
course!
I
mean
it.
I
know.
I
was
just
trying
to
be
funny.
Shall
we
go
to
the
Paradiso,
have
a
coffee?
I'd
like
that.
And
you?
What
do
you
do?
I
finished
at
the
conservatoire.
You're
a
musician!
Yes.
What
instrument--
I'm
sorry.
What
instrument?
The
cello.
Oh.
I
love
to
see
a
woman
playing
the
cello.
Here
we
are.
This
is
disgraceful!
How
dare
they!
You
know
what
people
are
like.
They
want
to
be
better
Nazis
than
Hitler.
I'm
going
in
there
to
complain.
No.
It's
better
not,
believe
me.
It's
so
humiliating,
someone
like
you.
We'll
find
somewhere
else.
We
could
walk
in
the
park.
No,
we
can't.
It's
an
official
decree.
No
Jews
allowed
in
the
park.
My
God,
are
you
joking?
I'm
not
joking.
I'd
suggest
we
sit
on
the
bench.
But
it's
another
official
decree.
No
Jews
allowed
on
public
benches.
This
is
absurd.
I'll
tell
you
what
we
can
do.
We
can
just
stand
here
and
talk.
I
think
we're
allowed
to
do
that,
don't
you?
So
you
play
the
cello,
Dorota.
That's
nice.
And
who's
your
favorite
composer?
Chopin?
Really?
You'll
have
to
learn
to
play
his
cello
sonata,
won't
you?
"And
what
about
you,
Wladek?"
Perhaps
I
can
accompany
you,
me
on
the
piano,
you
on
the
cello.
Mr.
Szpilman,
you
are
quite,
quite
wonderful.
Call
me
Wladek,
please.
"Re:

the
Warsaw
District.
"I
hereby

I

I
won't
wear
it.
I'm
not
going
to
be
branded.
Let--
Let
me
see
this.
Doesn't
it
say
we
have
to
provide
these
armbands
ourselves?
Where
will
we
get
them?
We're
not
going
to
get
them.
We're
not
going
to
wear
them.
Have
you
seen
this?
What?
What?
I'm
working.
What?
What
is
it?
It's
where
they're
going
to
put
us.
What
do
you
mean,
"put
us"?
"By
order
of
the
governor
of
the
Warsaw

Dr.
Fischer,
"concerning
the

District
by
31st
of

They
won't
get
all
of
us.
It's
too
small.
There's
400,000
of
us
in
Warsaw.
No.
360,000,
so
it'll
be
easy.
What
am
I
supposed
to
do?
You
tell
me
what
I
do
now.
Mama?
Mama,
what
is
it?
Twenty
zlotys.
That's
all
we
have
left,
20
zlotys.
What
can
I
buy
with
20
zlotys?
I
am
sick
of
cooking
potatoes,
potatoes,
potatoes.
That's
the
price.
That's
what
I'm
offering.
My
advice
is
to
accept.
You
won't
get
more
from
anyone
else.
But
it's
a
Bechstein,
Mr.
Lipa.
2,000...
and
my
advice
is
to
take
it.
What
are
you
gonna
do
when
you're
hungry,
eat
the
piano?
Get
out,
you
dirty
bastard!
What's
the
matter
with
you?
We'd
rather
give
it
away!
Go
on,
get
out!
Haven't
you
eaten
today?
What're
you
suffering
from?
You
people
are
crazy.
I'm
doing
you
a
favor.
Two
thousand,
and
I'm
paying
for
the
removal.
I'm
not
even
charging
for
the
removal!
You
haven't
eaten
today.
You're
crazy.
Take
it.
Dorota.
Hi.
I
didn't
want
to
come.
I
didn't
want
to
see
all
this,
but
I--
I
couldn't
stop
myself.
How
are
you
doing?
Fine.
Good.
No,
not
really.
They
arrested
my
cousin.
Jurek
says
they'll
let
him
out.
This
is
disgraceful.
It
won't
last
long.
Don't
worry.
That's
what
I
said,
it's
so--
It's
too
absurd.
I,
uh,
I
should--
Well,
I'll--
I'll
see
you...
soon.
Good-bye.
Well,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
I
thought
it
would
be
worse.
Where
will
we
sleep?
I'll
sleep
in
the
kitchen
with
the
girls.
You,
Henryk
and
Papa
in
here.
Look!
Come
and
look.
Go
away,
go
away!
Papa?
Papa?
Papa!
Papa.
Sell
anything?
Just
one.
Dostoyevsky,
The
Idiot.
Three
zlotys.
It's
better
than
yesterday.
Three
lousy
zlotys.
And
there
are
people
here
making
millions.
I
know.
You
don't
know,
believe
me.
They
bribe
the
guards.
The
guards
turn
a
blind
eye.
They're
bringing
in
cartloads:
food,
tobacco,
liquor,
French
cosmetics.
And
the
poor
are
dying
all
around
them,
they
don't
give
a
damn.
Excuse
me.
Have
you
seen
my
husband,
Izaak
Szerman?
A
tall,
handsome
man
with
a
little
gray
beard.
No?
Afraid
not.
All
right,
excuse
me.
Good-bye.
Sleep
well.
But,
but
if
you
see
him,
write
to
me.
Yes?
Izaak
Szerman.
Why
do
we
have
to
have
a
gentile
street
running
through
our
area?
Why
can't
they
go
around?
Don't
worry
about
it.
They're
about
to
build
a
bridge.
Haven't
you
heard?
A
bridge?
A
bridge?
A
shmidge.
The
Germans
claim
to
be
intelligent.
You
know
what
I
think?
I
think
they
are
totally
stupid.
I
have
a
family
to
feed.
I
spend
half
my
time
here
waiting
for
them
to
let
us
through.
Why
do
they
think
I
come
here?
To
listen
to
the
music?
Come.
Come.
Dance!
Good,
they're
here.
Yitzchak
Heller's
been
waiting
for
you.
What's
this
about?
Sit
down,
have
tea.
I'll
start
lunch
when
the
girls
get
back.
So,
what
are
you
doing
here?
He
brought
cakes.
His
father's
back
in
the
jewelry
business.
He's
doing
well,
eh?
Amazing.Jewelry.
We're
recruiting.
Who's
recruiting?
Don't
be
clever
with
me.
I've
come
here
as
a
friend.
They're
bringing
Jews
in
from
all
over
the
country.
Soon
there'll
be
a
half-million
people
in
the
ghetto.
We
need
more
Jewish
police.
Oh!
More
Jewish
police.
You
mean
you
want
me
to
beat
up
Jews
with
my
truncheon
and
catch
the
Gestapo
spirit.
I
see!
Somebody's
got
to
do
it,
Henryk.
But
why
me?
I
thought
you
only
recruited
boys
with
rich
fathers.
Look
at
my
father.
Look
at
us.
I
mean--
Yes,
I'm
looking!
That's
why
I'm
here.
Your
whole
family
can
have
a
better
life.
-
You
want
to
go
on
struggling
for
survival,
selling
books?
-
Yes,
please.
I'm
doing
you
people
a
favor.
What
about
you,
Wladek?
You're
a
great
pianist.
And
we've
got
an
excellent
police
jazz
band.
They'd
welcome
you
with
open
arms.Join
us.
You've
got
no
work.
Thank
you.
I've
got
work.
Right.
Yes,
of
course.
I'm
sorry,
Wladek,
he
wants
you
to
stop.
Who
wants
me
to
stop?
I
always
say,
look
on
the
bright
side!
You're
in
the
small
ghetto.
Intellectuals,
professional
people.
You're
better
off
than
us.
Here
in
the
large
ghetto,
it's
a
cesspool.
Jehuda,
give
me
something
to
do.
You're
an
artist.
You
keep
people's
spirits
up.
You
do
enough.
But
I
want
to
help.
I
want
to
do
something.
You're
too
well-known.
And
you
know
what?
You
musicians
don't
make
good
conspirators.
You're
too...
too...
musical!
What
was
that?
Symche.
Majorek.
There
are
notices
going
up.
The
city's
to
be
cleansed
of
undesirables.
There
are
always
notices
going
up.
Hello,
Symche.
Dolek.
Mrs.
Zyskind.
Jehuda,
working
hard?
Majorek,
this
is
the
greatest
pianist
in
Poland,
maybe
the
whole
world.
Wladyslaw
Szpilman.
Meet
Majorek.
I
know
your
name.
I've
never
heard
you
play.
Majorek
used
to
be
in
the
army.
Brilliant
man.
The
only
thing
I've
got
against
him
is
he's
not
a
socialist.
You
better
go
now,
Wladek.
It's
nearly
curfew.
You
know
how
many
copies
we
print
of
our
newspaper?
Five
hundred.
You
know
how
many
people
on
average
read
one
copy?
Twenty.
That
makes
10,000
readers.
These
will
start
the
uprising.
Majorek
hides
them
in
his
underpants,
and
leaves
them
in
toilets.
Toilets,
huh?
As
many
toilets
as
I
can
find.
Germans
never
use
Jewish
toilets.
They're
too
clean
for
them.
Please.
Please,
help,
sir.
Stop
it!
Stop
it!
Stop
it!
C'mon,
c'mon,
c'mon.
Come
on,
boy.
Stand
up.
Stand
up!
Stand
up!
Stand
up.
Stand
up.
And,
please,
tonight,
for
once,
I
don't
want
anything
bad
talked
about.
Enjoy
our
meal.
Fine.
Then
I'll
tell
you
something
funny.
Do
you
all
know
who
I
mean
by
Dr.
Raszeja?
-
The
surgeon?
-
The
surgeon.
For
some
reason--
don't
ask
me
why--
the
Germans
allowed
him
into
the
ghetto
to
perform
an
operation.
On
a
Jew?
They
allowed
a
Pole
to
come
in
to
operate
on
a
Jew?
He
got
a
pass.
That's
all
I
know.
Anyway.
He
puts
the
patient
to
sleep
and
starts
the
operation.
He's
just
made
the
first
incision
when
the
SS
burst
in,
shoot
the
patient
on
the
table,
then
shoot
Dr.
Raszeja
and
everybody
else
who
was
there.
Isn't
that
a
laugh?
The
patient
didn't
feel
a
thing,
he
was
anesthetized.
I
said
nothing
bad,
Henryk.
What's
the
matter
with
you
all?
Huh?
Huh?
You
lost
your
sense
of
humor?
It's
not
funny.
You
know
what's
funny?
You're
funny
with
that
ridiculous
tie.
What
are
you
talking
about
my
tie
for?
What
does
my
tie
have
to
do
with
anything?
I
need
this
tie
for
my
work.
Your
work?
-
That's
right,
I
work.
-
Yes.
Playing
the
piano
for
the
parasites
in
the
ghetto.
-
Parasites.
-
Boys.
Boys!
-
They
don't
give
a
damn
about
people
suffering.
-
You
blame
me
for
their
apathy.
I
do.
I
see
it
every
day.
They
don't
even
notice
what's
going
on
around
them.
-
I
blame
the
Americans.
-
For
what?
For
my
tie?
American
Jews,
and
there
are
lots
of'em.
What
have
they
done
for
us?
What
do
they
think
they're
doing?
People
here
are
dying,
haven't
got
a
bite
to
eat.
The
Jewish
bankers
there
should
be
persuading
America
to
declare
war
on
Germany.
Lights,
lights!
You!
Up!
Shh,
Mama.
What?
Oh,
my
God.
Shh.
Oh,
my
God.
Excuse
me.
I'm
Mr.
Szpilman's
sister.
Yes,
go
in.
Not
you.
What's
happened?
What?
God.
It's
terrible.
They're
hunting
people
in
the
streets.
They've
taken
Henryk.
Go
home,
all
right?
Go
home.
I'll
take
care
of
it.
Excuse
me.
Have
you
seen
my
husband,
Izaak
Szerman?
I'm
afraid
not.
He's
tall,
handsome,
a
little
gray
beard.
If
you
see
him,
write
to
me.
Don't
forget.
Izaak
Szerman.
What
happened
here?
They've
got
my
grandson.
They
pick
him
up.
They
take
him
away.
What
do
they
do
to
them?
I've
stopped
believing
in
God.
Excuse
me.
Excuse
me.
Yitzchak?
Yitzchak.
Wladek
Szpilman.
Henryk's
in
there.
I
haven't
seen
him.
Believe
me,
they've
picked
him
up.
Tough
luck.
Can
you
help?
Ha!
Now
you
need
me.
Yes,
now
you
need
me.
-
Can
you
help
us?
-
It
costs.
I've
no
money.
Then
there's
nothing
I
can
do.
You
should've
joined
us
when
you
had
the
chance.
Yitzchak,
they
told
me
you
had
influence.
Who
told
you?
People.
People
I
know.
They
said
you're
an
important
man.
Yitzchak?
Bandit!
Boom!
Boom!
Kaput.
Kaput!
Zigarette?
Mm.
Danke
schoen.
Help!
Help!
A
snatcher!
A
snatcher!
Help!
Help!
A
snatcher!
Why'd
they
pick
you
up?
So
you
go
to
Yitzchak
Heller.
Did
I
ask
you
to
talk
to
him?
You're
out,
aren't
you?
Did
you
beg?
Did
you
grovel
to
that
piece
of
shit?
No,
I
asked
him
to
help
you.
What
did
you
pay
him?
With
what
could
I
pay
him?
With
what?
Every
zloty
I
earn
we
spend
on
food.
I
can
look
after
myself.
They
were
taking
you
away.
It's
got
nothing
to
do
with
you!
It's
me
they
wanted,
not
you.
Why
do
you
have
to
interfere
with
other
people's
business?
You're
mad.
That's
your
trouble,
is
you're
mad.
That's
also
my
business.
Hold
it.
What's
the
matter?
What's
the
matter?
Are
you
sick?
Hungry.
Employment
certificate?
What's
that
mean,
no
employment
certificate?
You
have
to
have
an
employment
certificate...
to
work
for
one
of
the
German
firms
in
the
ghetto,
otherwise--
Otherwise,
what?
You
will
be
deported.
So
the
rumors
are
true.
They're
going
to
resettle
us.
Send
us
to
labor
camps
in
the
East.
And
they're
closing
the
small
ghetto.
My
God.
Wladek?
Wladek?
I
thought
you'd
be
off
on
tour
playing
London,
Paris,
New
York,
Chicago.
Not
this
week.
You
look
terrible.
Have
you
heard
the
rumors?
They're
going
to
resettle
us
in
the
East.
Rumors!
You
take
it
all
too
much
to
heart.
What's
the
trouble?
I've
been
trying
to
get
the
certificate
of
employment
for
my
father.
I've
managed
to
get
one
for
me
and
the
rest
of
my
family.
But
I
need
another
one
for
my
father.
I've
been
to
all
the
firms
and
shops.
Why
didn't
you
come
to
me?
I
didn't
know
you
were
in
the
certificate
business.
I'm
not,
but
Majorek
is.
Can
you
help?
I
have
no
money.
Please,
don't
insult
us.
Can
you
do
something
for
him?
Be
at
the
Schultz
Workshop
tomorrow,
4:00.
See
what
a
wonderful
piece
of
luck
you've
had
today?
That's
the
historical
imperative
in
action.
That's
why
I
always
say,
look
on
the
bright
side.
The
bright
side.
Yes,
I
know.
How's
your
back?
Better.
Better?
Better
than
last
week.
Thank
you.
My
pleasure.
It
won't
help
you
anyway!
Thank
you,
Mr.
Schultz.
Well,
at
least
we
got
work
in
the
ghetto.
At
least
we're
still
together.
Du.
Du.
Du.
Du.
Du.
Du.
I'm
sorry.
I
did
my
best.
I
thought
the
certificates
would
save
us.
Stop
it,
Wladek!
Let's
just
hope
that
Henryk
and
Halina
will
be
better
off.
Where
will
we
be
going?
You're
going
to
work.
You'll
be
much
better
off
than
in
this
stinking
ghetto.
Move.
Why
did
I
do
it?
Why
did
I
do
it,
huh?
Why
did
I
do
it?
Why
did
I
do
it?
Why
did
I
do
it?
Why
did
I
do
it?
Why
did
I
do
it?
Why
did
I
do
it?
Why
did
I
do
it?
Why
did
I
do
it?
Don't
you
have
a
drop
of
water?
He's
dying.
My
child's
dying
of
thirst.
No.
I'm
sorry.
I
beg
you.
I
beg
you.
Don't
you
have
a
drop
of
water?
I
beg
you.
Can
you
hear
what
I'm
saying?
I'm
telling
you
it's
a
disgrace!
I
can
hear
you!
We
let
them
take
us
to
our
death
like
sheep
to
the
slaughter.
Not
so
loud.
Why
don't
we
attack
them?
There's
half
a
million
of
us
here.
We
could
break
out
of
the
ghetto.
At
least
we
could
die
honorably,
not
as
a
stain
on
the
face
of
history.
Why
are
you
so
sure
they're
sending
us
to
our
death?
I'm
not
sure!
You
know
why
I'm
not
sure?
Because
they
didn't
tell
me.
They're
gonna
wipe
us
all
out.
What
do
you
want
me
to
do?
Do
you
want
me
to
fight?
To
fight
you
need
organization--
He's
right.
What
do
you
think
I
can
do,
fight
them
with
my
violin
bow?
The
Germans
will
never
squander
a
huge
labor
force
like
this.
They're
sending
us
to
a
labor
camp.
It's
obvious.
Oh,
sure!
Look
at
that
cripple
there.
Look
at
the
old
people,
the
children.
They're
gonna
work?
Look
at
you?
You
gonna
carry
iron
girders
on
your
back?
Henryk!
Halina!
Henryk!
Halina!
Henryk!
We
heard
you
were
here.
We
wanted
to
be
with
you.
We
wanted
to
be
with
you.
Stupid,
stupid.
Why
did
I
do
it?
Why
did
I
do
it?
She's
getting
on
my
nerves.
What
did
she
do,
for
God's
sake?
She
smothered
her
baby.
They
prepared
a
hiding
place,
so,
of
course,
they
went
there.
But
the
baby
cried
just
as
the
police
came.
She
smothered
the
cries
with
her
hands.
The
baby
died.
Apoliceman
heard
the
death
rattle,
found
where
they
were
hiding.
Mama.
What
are
you
reading?
"If
you
prick
us,
do
we
not
bleed?
"If
you
tickle
us,
do
we
not
laugh?
"If
you
poison
us,
do
we
not
die?
And
if
you
wrong
us,
shall
we
not
revenge?"
Very
appropriate.
Yes,
that's
why
I
brought
it.
Idiot.
What's
he
think
he's
going
to
do
with
the
money?
Hey,
boy?
Come
here.
Come
here.
How
much
for
a
caramel?
Twenty
zlotys.
What,
for
one
caramel?
What
do
you
think
you're
going
to
do
with
the
money?
Twenty
zlotys.
Have
we
got
20
between
us?
I
got
ten,
I
think.
Why?
Why
did
I
do
it?
Why
did
I
do
it?
Why
did
I--
Halina?
What?
It's
a
funny
time
to
say
this,
but--
What?
I
wish
I
knew
you
better.
Thank
you.
Szpilman!
Szpilman.
Fuck
off,
stupid.
Go!
Papa.
Papa!
Papa!
Mama!
Halina!
Halina!
Mama!
What
do
you
think
you're
doing,
Szpilman?
I've
saved
your
life!
Now,
get
out!
Just
go.
Go!
Don't
run!
Mama!
Mama!
Mama!
Well,
off
they
go
to
the
melting
pot.
Ja.
What
are
you
doing?
She's
pregnant!
Left-Hut!
Forward!
Wladek!
Why
are
you
here,
Wladek?
It's
like
this,
I--
I--
We--
All
of
them.
All
of
them.
All
of
them.
Perhaps
they
are
lucky.
The
quicker,
the
better.
It's
not
finished
yet.
We'll
stay
here
for
a
couple
of
days...
until
things
die
down.
I've
bribed
a
policeman.
He'll
come
when
it's
over.
My
God.
I
haven't
been
outside
in--
it
must
be
two
years.
Don't
get
overexcited.
Gold.
A
very
good
price.
Someone
you
know?
A
beauty.
Who
is
she?
She's
a
singer.
I
know
her
well,
actually.
Her
husband's
an
actor.
They're
good
people.
I'd
like
to
talk
to
her.
Don't
forget,
they
hang
them
for
helping
Jews.
Achtung!
How
long
have
you
been
here?
Since
last
night.
I
was
pleased
to
see
you.
They're
going
to
start
a
final
resettlement
now.
We
know
what
it
means.
We
sent
someone
out--
Zygmunt.
A
good
man.
His
orders
were
to
follow
the
trains
out
of
Warsaw.
He
got
to
Sokolow.
A
local
railway
man
told
him
the
tracks
divided,
one
branch
leading
to
Treblinka.
He
said
every
day
freight
trains
carrying
people
from
Warsaw...
branched
off
to
Treblinka
and
returned
empty.
No
transports
of
food
are
ever
seen
on
that
line.
And
civilians...
are
forbidden
to
approach
the
Treblinka
station.
They're
exterminating
us.
It
won't
take
them
long.
We're
60,000
left
out
ofhalf
a
million.
Mostly
young
people.
And
this
time
we're
gonna
fight.
We're
in
good
shape,
organized.
We're
prepared.
If
you
need
help,
I--
You!
Come
here!
Oh,
Shit.
Shit.
Sorry.
I'm
sorry.
I--
I--
I
don't
know
what
I
was
thinking.
No.
Please,
don't.
Please.
Please.

I
hope
you
play
the
piano
better
than
you
carry
bricks.
He
won't
last
long
if
he
goes
on
like
this.
I'll
see
if
I
can
get
him
something
better.
Trouble.
Fall
in!
Only
the
Jews!
Poles
go
on
working!
Only
the
Jews!
I
have
good
news
for
you.
There
are
rumors
go
around...
that
we
like
to,
uh--
Umsiedlung--
resettle
you.
I
promise
you
that
now
and
in
the
future,
nothing
else
is
plan-ned.
Ja?
For
this
reason,
we
put
information
posters
on
the
wall.
To
show
you
our
goodwill,
you
should
vote
one
of
you...
to
be
allowed-ed
to
go
in
town
daily...
and
bring
three
kilos
kartoffel--
potato,
ja?
And
one
loaf
of
bread...
for
each
of
your
workers.
So,
why
should
we
do
something
else
like
this...
if
we
would
resettle
you?
You
can
make
good
business...
out
of
the
things
you
don't
eat.
Isn't
that
something
where
you
Jews
are
good
in?
Make
money?
That
one--
with
the
string.
The
others
are
tied
by
wire.
Now.
Majorek.
I've
a
favor
to
ask.
I
want
to
get
out
of
here.
It's
easy
to
get
out.
It's
how
you
survive
on
the
other
side
that's
hard.
I
know.
I
know.
Last
summer
I
worked
for
a
day
in
Zelanzna
Brama
Square.
I
saw
someone
I
knew.
She's
an
old
friend.
A
singer.
Her
husband's
an
actor.
I've
written
their
names
down
and
their
address--
if
they're
still
there.
Janina
Godlewska
and
Andrzej
Bogucki.
They're
good
people.
Would
you
try
and
make
contact?
They
go
to
town.
Would
you
just
ask
them?
Ask
them
if
they'll
help
me
get
out
of
here.
Uh--
I,
uh--
I
tried
your
friends.
They
don't
live
there
anymore.
But...
you
made
contact?
Be
ready
to
leave.
When?
Soon.
Halt!
Oh,
shit.
Shit.

Und

Und

Und

Und

Und

Und

Und

Und

Und

Und

Nein.
Achtung!
Marsch!
?
Their
ranks
unite
?
?
And
follow
the
white
eagle
?
?
Stand
up
and
fight
?
?
Our
mortal
enemies
?
?
Rifle,
grenade
?
?
Let's
give
them
fire
and
brimstone
?
Now.
I'm
sorry.
I'm
dirty.
I'm
so
filthy.
We
haven't
much
time.
Come
on.
-
We
must
hurry.
Here.
See
if
these
fit.
Going
to
have
to
keep
moving.
Germans
are
hunting
down
indiscriminately
now.
Jews,
non-Jews.
Anybody.
Everybody.
Oh,
and,
uh,
Wladek,
better
shave.
Use
my
razor
on
the
shelf.
You'll
be
looked
after
by
Marek
Gebczynski.
He's
on
the
other
side
of
town.
You'll
stay
there
tonight,
then
we'll
find
you
somewhere
else.
I'll
bring
you
food.
All
right.
Let's
go.
I'll
show
you
where
you're
going
to
sleep.
You
have
to
stay
here
until
tomorrow
afternoon.
We
have
a
flat
for
you
near
the
ghetto
wall.
But
it's
safe.
It's
not
going
to
be
very
comfortable.
I'll
be
fine.
Thank
you.
I'll
take
it.
Yeah.
Give
it
to
me.
Go
as
near
to
the
front
as
possible,
to
the
German
section.
I'm
going
to
draw
the
curtains
now.
But
you
leave
them
open
during
the
daytime.
Don't
forget.
Must
feel
better
of
this
side
of
the
wall,
huh?
Yes.
But
sometimes
I'm
still
not
sure
which
side
of
the
wall
I'm
on.
Some
bread...
potatoes,
onions.
I
will
come
again.
And
Nina
Bogucki
will
visit
twice
a
week,
bring
more
food,
see
how
you
are.
Luck.
Oh.
This
is
very
important.
In
case
of
emergency--
I
mean,
emergency--
go
to
this
address.
Ohhh.
Ohhh.
Puppy-dog,
what
do
you
mean
you
forgot?
What
do
you
think
I
mean,
kitten.
I
forgot,
that's
what
I
mean.
You
know
what?
You
treat
me
like
dirt.
I
treat
you
like
dirt
because
you
are
dirt.
Pig.
Pig!
Bitch!
Dirty
pig!
You
are
a
dirty
pig.
Takes
one
to
know
one,
pig!
Mmm.
You
play
like
an
angel,
kitten.
If
I
play
like
an
angel,
why
don't
you
listen?
I
was
listening,
kitten.
Liar.
You
fell
asleep.
Pig.
-
Fire!
-
Fire!
Schiessen.
Thank
you.
I
wanted
to
come
earlier,
but--
No,
no,
no.
Thank
you.
No
one
thought
they'd
hold
out
so
long.
I
never
should
have
come
out.
I
should
have
stayed
there
and
fought
with
them.
Wladek,
stop
that.
It's
over
now.
Just
be
proud
it
happened.
My
God,
did
they
put
up
a
fight.
Yes,
well,
so
did
the
Germans.
They're
in
shock.
They
didn't
expect
it.
Nobody
expected
it.
Jews
fighting
back.
Who
would've
thought?
Well,
what
good
did
it
do?
What
good?
Wladek,
I'm
surprised
at
you.
They
died
with
dignity,
that's
what
good
it
did.
And
you
know
something
else?
Now
the
Poles
will
rise.
We're
ready.
We'll
fight
too.
You'll
see?
Get
your
things
together.
You
have
to
leave.
What?
What's
happened?
I'm
on
the
run.
Why?
What's
happened?
The
gestapo
found
our
weapons.
They've
arrested
Janina
and
Andrzej.
They're
bound
to
find
out
about
this
place
too.
You
must
get
away
at
once.
Where
do
you
want
me
to
go?
Look
at
me.
I'm
not
leaving.
Can't
I
take
my
chances
here?
That's
your
decision.
But
when
they
storm
the
flat,
throw
yourself
out
the
window.
Don't
let
them
get
you
alive.
I
have
poison
on
me.
They
won't
get
me
alive
either.
Open
up.
Open
the
door
at
once
or
we'll
call
the
police!
Are
you
from
this
flat?
You're
not
registered.
It
belongs
to
a
friend
of
mine.
I
just
came
to
visit,
but
I
must
have
just
missed
him.
-
Have
you
got
your
identity
card?
-
Huh?
-
Let
me
see
your
identity
card!
-
Yes.
Of
course.
-
I
want
to
see
your
identity
card!
-
What's
happening?
He's
a
Jew!
A
Jew!
Stop
the
Jew!
Don't
let
him
out!
Stop
him!
Ohhh.
Yes?
Mr.
Gebczynski
sent
me.
Wladyslaw
Szpilman.
Dorota.
Oh.
Come
in.
I--
I'm
sorry.
I-I'm
sorry.
I
was
given
this
address.
I'm
looking
for
a
Mr.
Dzikiewicz.
Michal
Dzikiewicz.
He's
my
husband.
Come
in.
Sit.
I
need
help.
He'll
be
back
before
curfew.
I've...
been
in
hiding.
I
need
somewhere
to
stay.
He'll
be
here
soon.
How
long
have
you
been
married?
Just
over
a
year.
And
how's
Yurek?
Dead.
Oh.
Um--
And
when--
when's
your
baby
due?
Christmas.
This
is
not
a
good
time
to
have
children,
but
then--
This
is
my
husband.
Wladyslaw
Szpilman.
Marek
Gebczynski
sent
him.
Oh,
yes.
I
remember.
M-Mr.
Gebczynski
said
to
contact
you
only
in
case
of
emergency.
Uh,
don't
worry
now.
We
can't
move
you
tonight.
You'll
sleep
on
the
sofa.
Oh.
Excuse
me.
I'm
sorry.
Could
I
have
a
piece
of
bread?
Y-Yes.
Of
course.
We'll
eat.
Sit.
Please,
sit.
Thank
you.
You're
in
a
very
German
area.
The
building
opposite
is
a
hospital
taking
in
wounded
from
the
Russian
front.
And
next
door
is
the
Schutzpolizei.
Safest
place
to
be.
Right
at
the
heart
of
the
lion's
den.
I'll
be
locking
you
in.
No
one
knows
you're
here,
so
keep
as
quiet
as
possible.
All
well?
Thank
you.
This
is
Antek
Szalas.
He
will
be
looking
after
you.
How
do
you
do?
Thank
you.
Oh.
How
do
you
do?
I've
given
him
a
second
key.
He'll
bring
you
food,
see
that
you're
all
right.
He's
with
the
underground.
He's
a
good
man.
You
don't
remember
me,
Mr.
Szpilman.
No.
I
don't
think
so.
Warsaw
Radio.
I
was
a
technician.
I
saw
you
almost
every
day.
Sorry.
I
don't
remember.
I--
Doesn't
matter.
You've
nothing
to
worry
about.
I'll
visit
often.
You'll
be
pleased
to
hear
that
the
Allies
are
bombing
Germany...
night
after
night
after
night.
Cologne.
Hamburg.
Berlin.
And
the
Russians
are
really
giving
them
hell.
It's
the
beginning
of
the
end.
Oh.
Let's
hope
so.
Still
alive
then?
Here.
Sausage.
Bread.
You've
still
got
that
vodka?
Mmm.
How
long
is
this
meant
to
last?
Not
long
now.
I
thi--
I
think
I've
got
jaundice.
Don't
worry
about
that.
It
just
makes
you
look
funny.
My
grandfather
was
jilted
by
his
girlfriend
when
he
got
jaundice.
Drink
up.
Why-Why
didn't
you
come
sooner?
It's
been
over
two
weeks.
Problems.
Money.
I've
got
to
raise
money
to
buy
the
food.
I
need
things
to
sell.
It's
not
easy.
Here.
Sell
this.
Food's
more
important
than
time.
Oh,
yes.
I
meant
to
tell
you.
The
Allies
have
landed
in
France.
The
Russians
will
be
here
soon.
They'll
beat
the
shit
out
of
the
Germans.
Any
day
now.
No,
no,
no.
Wladek?
Wladek.
I
knew
it.
I
knew
this
would
happen.
I'll
get
a
doctor.
You
can't.
It's
too
dangerous.
I'll
get
Doctor
Luczak.
We
can
trust
him.
Dorota,
don't
be
ridiculous.
He's
a
pediatrician.
He's
still
a
doctor.
No.
You
stay.
I'll
go.
We
came
to
say
good-bye.
We're
going
to
stay
with
my
mother
in
Otwock.
The
baby's
already
there.
It's
safer.
There's
talk
that
the
uprising
will
begin
any
day
now.
That
man
Szalas
should
be
shot.
He's
been
collecting
money
on
your
behalf
all
over
Warsaw.
Apparently,
people
gave
generously.
So
he
collected
a
tidy
sum.
My
God.
Liver
the
size
of
a
football.
Acute
inflammation
of
the
gall
bladder.
But
he'll
live.
I'll
try
to
get
him
some
levulose.
But
it's
not
easy.
Can
you
visit
him
again?
Who
knows?
Doctor?
Doctor,
thank
you.
Don't
speak.
Rest.
Thank
you
so
much
for
coming.
We
brought
you
some
food.
I'll
prepare
something
now
for
you.
Then
we
must
go.
Get
out!
Get
out,
get
out!
Get
out
in
the
street.
Go
on
the
street!
Get
out
now,
the
Germans
are
surrounding
the
building!
No.
No!
Someone.
Somebody.
Somebody
help
me!
Oh!
Hu--
What?

Ja.
Achtung!
Szpilman.
Szpilman.


German!
German!
No,
don't
shoot!
I
am
Polish.
Please!
Ah!
I'm
Polish.
I--
Come
out
with
your
hands
up.
Please.
I
beg
of
you.
Don't
shoot.
Don't
shoot,
I
beg
you.
I'm
Polish.
I'm
Polish.
Come
down!
Please.
I'm
Polish.
Please.
Please.
He's
Polish.
Yes,
he's
Polish.
Why
the
fucking
coat?
I'm
cold.
Look
at
them.
German
fuckers!
Murderers!
Murderers!
Dirty
bastards!
Assassins!
Bastards!
Look
at
you
now.
You
took
everything
I
had.
Me,
a
musician.
You
took
my
violin.
Sons
of
bitches!
You
took
my
soul.
Ja.
It
was
here.
I'm
certain
of
it.
Well,
it's
not
here
now.
I
shouted
abuse
at
them.
I'm
not
proud
of
it,
but
that's
what
I
did.
And
I'm
certain
I
stood
where
you
are
now.
There
was
barbed
wire,
and
this
German
came
up
to
me.
-
You
didn't
catch
his
name.
-
No.
I'll
ask
at
the
factory.
They
may
know
something.
