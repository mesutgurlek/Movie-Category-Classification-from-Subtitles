how
was
your

Successful
I
hope,
for
all
our
sakes.

Ragnar:
The

attacked
us
in
great
force,

But
we
defeated
them!

You
are
the
man
that

say
you
are...
A
great
adventurer...
And
I
am
happy
to
salute
your
achievements
and
to
share
in
the
profit
of
your
raid.
But
I
don't
see
my
friend,
Knut,
where...
where
is
he?
Knut
is
dead.
Dead?
Did
he
die
in
the
battle?
No.
Then
how
did
he
die?
I
killed
him.
You
killed
him.
For
what
reason?
Because
he
tried
to
rape
my
wife,
Lagertha.
I
find
it
too
convenient
that
you
would
make
an
excuse
to
kill
my
friend
and
my
agent
on
your
voyage.
What
did
you
think
that
you
would
gain
by
getting

It's,
um...
It's
a
delicate
matter.
You...
You
are

brother
of
Ragnar
Lothbrok,
are
you
not?
I
am.
A
spirited
man,
your
brother.
Is
he
a
fair
man?
Does
he
treat
you
equally
Up
to
a
point.
Forgive
me,
but
I
think
And
that
whatever
he
says,
in
actual
fact,
he
considers
himself
to
be
first
among
equals.
Am
I
correct?

I
get
the
impression
that
he
wants
to...
To
take
the
credit
for
everything...
For
building
the
boat,
for
sailing
west.
He
wants
to
be
the
hero.
Is
that
what
it
comes
down
to?
To
him?
Would
he
have
achieved
what
he
has
achieved
if
it
wasn't
for
you?

What
do
you
say,
Rollo?
Of
course
not.
It
would
have
been
impossible.
As
long
as
I
am
Earl,
Ragnar
Lothbrok
can
give
you
nothing.
I,
on
the
other
hand,
can
I
could,
for
example,
that
you
brought
back
from
england...
And
offer
you
a
goodly
portion
of
it.
Would
you
do
that,
lord?
I
might.
Depends.
On
what
would
it
depend?
Your
ambition.
You
want
to
stand
out.
You
want
to
be
someone,
Rollo.
You
want
the
gods
to
notice
you,
yes?

would
have
noticed
me
already.

is
my
daughter,
Thyri.
She
is
soon
to
get
married
and
I
must

very
carefully

must

man
of
ambition
and
prospect,
as
you
can
understand.

used
to
have
two
boys
So
the

that
I
choose
will
hold
a

and

place,

is

brother
of

Lothbrok.

lot
about
you.

say
that
you
are
a
great
warrior.

prisoner.

Woman:
That
murderer!

Bjorn:
Look
at
him!
He's
in
chains.
It's
all
right,
boy.
We
are
all
aware
of
the
sacred
You
stand
before
us
accused
of
Knut,
my
brother.
Knut,
as
some
of
you
may
know,
was
the
bastard
son
of
my
father.
But
I
loved
him...
Like
a
brother.
I
asked
Knut
to...
To
go
with
Ragnar
Lothbrok
to
england,
where
they
raided
a
town
and
And
while
they
were
raiding
this
town,
Ragnar
Lothbrok
took
it
upon
himself
to
cold-bloodedly
kill
my
brother.
It's
easy
to
imagine
why
a
man
like
this
would
do
such
a
thing.
This
is
an
ambitious
man.
He
doesn't
care
to
share
his
spoils,
and
he
resents
the
fact
that
he
owes
me
loyalty
and
obedience,
as
his
chieftain.

is

man

does

Haraldson:
What
do
you
have
to
say,
when
you
stand
before
us,
and
know
that
you
must
tell
the
truth?
It
is
that
true
that
I
killed
Knut,
sadly,
your
brother.
But
I
killed
him
when
I
found
him
trying
to
rape
my
wife.
I
ask
all
of
you
freemen,
what
would
have
you
done
Would
have
you
just
stood
back,
encouraged
the
culprit?
I
don't
think
you
would.
And
even
if
I
had
of
known
at
the
time
he
was
your
brother,
I
would
have
carried
out
the
same
sentence.
Svein:
Do
you
seriously
ask
I
can
confirm
the
story.

You
are
the
wife
of
Ragnar
Lothbrok?
I
am,
lord.
How
extraordinary
that
at
the
same
time.

Your
husband
is
lying
and
you
are
so
under
his
thumb
that
he
has
persuaded
you
to
lie
for
him.
May
Thor
strike
you
dead!

Earl
Haraldson:
What
did
you
say?
My
husband
did
not
kill
Knut
Tjodolf.
Svein:
Then
who
did?
Lagertha:
I
did!
I
killed
him.
I
stabbed
him
in
the
heart
when
he
tried
his
best
to
rape
me.
Svein:
A
murder
is
committed
and
the
only
witnesses
are

Unfortunately,
we
can't
tell
because
they
both
claim
credit
for
it.
You
didn't
kill
my
brother.
Look
at
you,
how
could
you?
He
killed
my
brother.
Ragnar
Lothbrok
killed
my
brother.
We
have
proof.
We
have
a
witness
to
the
killing.
(Whispers
of
surprise
Svein:
You
say
you
are
a
witness
Yes.
Svein:
You'll
swear
this
Yes,
I
was
there.
I
saw
everything.
Earl
Haraldson:
So,
who
killed
my
brother?

Ragnar
Lothbrok
killed
him.

In
cold
blood?
No,
lord.
For
a
good
reason.
What
Ragnar
Lothbrok
has
sworn
is
true.
Your
half-brother
was
caught
Then
he
attempted
to
rape
Lagertha,
the
shield-maiden.

You
cannot

him.

it.
