NARRATOR".
One
small
fact.
You
are
going
to
die.
Despite
every
effort,
no
one
lives
forever.
Sorry
to
be
such
a
spoiler.
My
advice
is,
It
doesn't
seem
to
help.
I
guess
I
should
introduce
myself
properly.
But
then
again,
Not
before
your
time,
of
course.
I
make
it
a
policy
to
avoid
the
living.
Well,
except
sometimes.
Once
in
a
very
long
time...
I
can't
help
myself.
I
get
interested.


I
don't
know
exactly
what
it
But
she
caught
me.
Mama.
NARRATOR:
And]
cared.



She
would
have
kept
you
if
she
could
have.
You
know
that,
don't
you?
Here
we
are.
Come,
Liesel.
Meet
your
new
parents.
Come.
Hans
Hubermann.
Heinrich.
Heinrich.
Where
is
the
boy?
He
died.
What
do
you
mean?
On
the
way
here.
They
had
to
bury
him
by
the
tracks.
They
promised
us
Rosa,
you
cannot
blame
the
boy
for
dying.
ROSA:
No,
I
blame
his
mother.
Dragging
them
HANS:
She
was
running
for
her
life.
Have
you
seen
that
girl?
Filthy.
Everything
they
say
about

I'll
speak
as
loud
as
I
want.
Come.
Come!
What
is
the
matter
with
her?
Your
Majesty.
What
are
you
brats
looking
at?

This
is
Heaven
Street,
your
new
home.
Hey,
lover
boy!
Please,
go
in.
Well,
go
on.
What
do
you
say?
They
have
given
us
a
mute.
Go
upstairs.
Where
is
it?
That
one.
It's
for
you.
ROSA:
Hans!
Yes,
my
sunshine?


Good
morning,
Your
Majesty.
Would
you
stop
that
racket?

What
do
you
say?
Thank
you.
It
speaks?
Now,
listen,
Say
it.
Mama.
Good.
And
that
Saukerl,
that
lazy
pig
over
there...
you
call
him
"Papa."
Understood?
Papa.

Who
is
that?
Who
is
it?
Rudy
Steiner,
Frau
Hubermann.
What
do
you
want?
RUDY:
My
mother
says
ROSA:
What's
it
to
you?
I'm
here
to
take
her
to
school.
Why
can't
people
ever
Hello,
Rudy.
Hello!
And
what
makes
you
think
you
Rudy.
I'm
almost
12.
Liesel,
eat
your
soup
Stay
outside,
you
filthy
bastard.
Hurry
up,
Liesel.
Do
you
like
to
run?
I
bet
I
could
beat
you.
No
one
has
ever
beaten
me
in
a
race.
You
don't
say
much,
do
you?

Is
that
one
spit,
"Yes,"
and
two
spits,
"No"?

I'm
glad
we
understand
each
other.
My
mother
I
just
thought
you
might
need
a
friend.


-
RUDY:
Dan/re
beautiful!
What
are
you
up
to?
Nothing,
Papa.
Then
get
to
school.


Come
on.
You
are?
Frau
Hubermann's
new
daughter.
I
was
not
addressing
you,
Steiner.
Girl,
speak.
Liesel
Meminger.
Chalk,
board,
name.
Come,
girl.
We
don't
have
all
day.
Write
it.

Silence.

Silence!
Back
to
your
seat,
now.

Silence.
ALL:

fool!
Hey,
fool.
Can't
you
even
read
yet?
Go
on.
Read
one
word.
Read
something.
Fool.

She's
killing
him!
RUDY:
I
bet
that
wasn't
your
first
fight.
Franz
German
hasn't
been
hit
like
that...
since
he
peed
in
Tommy
Muller's
lunchbox.
Franz
German
doesn't
sound
very
smart.
He's
the
dumbest
kid
in
school.
But
he
shaves.
You
remember
how
to
get
home?
Just
because
I
can't
read
All
right.
I'll
follow
you,
then.
You
could
join
our
soccer
team,
you
know?
Look,
you
should
because
I
won't
be
here
long
enough.
Why
not?
I'm
running
away.
That's
why
not.
Where
to?
None
of
your
business.
Well,
let
me
know
when.
Why?
Sol
can
come
with
you.
You
don't
understand.
I'm
serious.
I
have
to
find
my
mother.
Frau
Hubermann?
No,
fool
My
real
mother.
Great.
I'd
like
to
meet
her.
What
are
you
doing
now?
Racing
you.
I'll
bet
you
a
kiss
I
can
beat
you.
Why
would
I
want
to
kiss
you?
I
don't
know.
What
does
that
matter?
I'm
the
one
who's
going
to
win.
Just
to
the
end
of
the
street.
And
what
if
I
win?
You
don't
have
to
kiss
me.
Ever?
What
do
you
care?
You're
not
sticking
around,
right?
Hey!
Saumensch!

You
cheated.
So
what?
-
I
beat
you.
It
was
a
draw.
Draw
means
I
get
the
kiss.
You
can
stick
your
kiss.
Oh,
my
God.
She's
going
to
kill
you.
Who?
If
you
think
that
I
am
you
are
very
much
mistaken.
Do
you
hear?
I
have
just
come
to
say
good
night.
What
is
this?
Is
it
yours?
Why
would
a
nice
girl
like
you
Are
you
sure
this
is
yours?
It
wasn't
always
mine.
It
belonged
to
my
brother.
I
see.
Your
brother...
his
name
was
Pieter
Strauss?
Do
you
know
what
this
says?
Do
you
want
to
know
what
it
says?
I'm

Listen,
he
told
me
he
can
only
take
one.
-
Take
Max.
Take
him!
Go!
I
won't
leave
without
you.
Yes,
you
will.
Upon
your
father's
grave,
you
will.
There's
no
time
for
heroics,
Max.
One

none.
Come.

are
inside.
They
don't
look
great,
but
they'll
have
to
do.
Go
find
him.
Forgive
me.

NARRATOR:
When
I
finally
it
was
this
moment
For
leaving
his
mother.
For
feeling
that
awful,
light-headed
relief...
that
he
would
live.

can
you
do?

I

Can
we

Come.
I
have
a
surprise
for
you.
It's
very
dark
here.
We
had
better
turn
on
the
light.
It's
a
dictionary.
Some
of
the
words
we
have
learned.
Add
as
many
as
you
like.

yours.
Thank
you,

He's
done
it!
He's
made

Hey!

Ow!
You
want
to
remain

Why?
Why

Why?
He's

The
fastest

is
crazy.

RUDY:
Ow!
That
hurts.
It's
even
in
his
earholes.

Fine,
you
deal
with
him.
Son...
you
can't
go

Why
not?
Because
you
shouldn't

Because
I
say
so.
Yes?

HANS:
Liesel,
I
know
you
like
it
down
here...
but
don't
you
think
I'm
writing
Mama
a
letter.
Well,
that's
very
good.
Please
tell
her,
from
me,
Not
that
mama.
I
see.
What
are
you
telling
her?
Everything.
About
you
and
Mama
and
Rudy.
Can
you
send
it
for
me?
Well...
You
could
give
it
Frau
Heinrich?
Yes.
I'm
sure
she
would
do
her
best
to
pass
it
on.
Ah,
found
it.

is
she
doing

her
mother.

not
going

money...

was
I
to

Good
man.
Are
you
ready
to
go?
Of
course
he
is.

Hey,
Jesse
Owens.
Push
off,
Franz.
Leave
him
alone.
Did
you
like
the
speech,
What
about
it?
Your
mother
was
one,
wasn't
she?
A
communist?
That's
what
they
say.
Who's
"they"?
You
even
look
like
one.
What
are
you
talking
about?
I'm
not
talking
to
you,
Steiner.
She
knows.
Burn
a
book.
Go
on,
burn
a
book.
Go
on!
I'll
be
watching.
Both
of
you.
What
was
that
about?
Nothing.


HANS:
Liesel.
Where
have
you
been?
Sorry,
Pa
pa.
Let's
go
now.

What
is
it?
Nothing.

Are
you
sick?
No.
I'm
fine.
Tell
me,
what
is
the
matter
with
you?

What
the
hell
is
this?
You
stole
it?
Sorry,
Pa
pa.
Are
you
going
to
tell
Mama?
Papa?
Did
anyone
see
you?
I'll
tell
you
what.
Let's
make
this
our
secret.
We'll
read
it
like
the
other
book.
In
the

Thank
you,
Papa.
Good,
now.
We
better
get
back
Liesel,
come.
What
is
it?
Liesel?
My
mother
isn't
coming
back,
is
she?
Is
she
a
communist?
-
Who
told
you
that?
Did
the
Fuhrer
take
her
away?
Then
I
hate
the
Fuhrer.
No.
You
can't
say
that.
Don't
ever
say
that.

you

Quickly.

What
is
this?
-
Max.
No.
No.
Help
me.
We'll
put
him
upstairs.
Liesel,
everything
is
fine.
Here
we
go.
I'll
warm
him
some
soup.
Who
is
he,
Papa?
I
have
something

must
listen.

is
not

who
owns
that

looking
after

Did

I
need
you
to
promise
me.
I
need
you
to
give
me
your
word
that
you
will
not
tell
Nobody.
Not
a

Not

I
mean
it,
Liesel.
Not
a

Understand?

good

I
have
yours?
Yes,

I
promise.
Did

talk

Yes.

trust

looks
like
death.

him
on?

have
enough
to
feed
ourselves!
We
will
make
do.

will
make
do."
We
have
always
known

could
turn
him
in

would
understand.

could
say

was
late
at
night...

know.
-

everything.

that's
all.
We'll
just
go
about
things

Hello.
What
were
you
dreaming
about?
My
mother.
Is
that
your
book?
Yes.
No,
it...
It
wasn't
always
mine.
Did
you
steal
it?
No.

Can
I
see
it?
it's
not

Ah.
Good
morning,
Max.
You
have
met
Liesel?
Liesel.
Don't
worry.

a
good
girl.
Not
a
word.

the
rush?

have
to
get
home.

you.
I
have
to
go
inside.
What
do
you
want?
My
permission?
No.
I'm
just
telling
you.
Fine.
See
you,
Saumensch.
Where
have
you
been?
You're
late.
Iran
as
fast
as
I
could.
And
you
mentioned
nothing
to

No,

asleep.

At
least
someone
knows
I'm
sorry.
I'm
sorry.

Is
he
going
to
be
all
right?
Of

curious

didn't

is

about?

you

from

Yes.

you

communist?

he
take
away
your

Probably.
Don't
worry.

cried
a
lot
when
I
first
came,

soup
is
terrible,
isn't
it?

may
find

hard
to
believe,

ever
thrown

how

A

Do
you
think
my

really
loved
me?
Of
course.

loves

I
tell?
Th
e
Burgermeister's
wife.
She
lets
me
read
her
books.
I
memorize
them.
"Memory
is
the
scribe
of
the
soul."
Do
you
know
who
said
that?
A
man
called
Aristotle.
Can
you
do
me
a
favor?
Can
you
describe
the
day
for
me?
What's
it
like
outside?
It's
cloudy.
No,
no,
no.
Make
the
words
yours.
If
your
eyes
could
speak...
what
would
they
say?
It's
a
pale
day.
"Pale."
Good.
Go
on.
Everything's
stuck
behind
a
cloud.
And
the
sun...
doesn't
look
like
the
sun.
What
does
it
look
like?
Like
a
silver
oyster?

Thank
you.
I
saw
that.

We're
hiding
a
Jew.

Johann?
No.
It's
Liesel.

What's
the
meaning
of
this?
And
he
didn't
say
why?
I
don't
understand
it.
I've
always
ironed
Maybe
they
can't
afford
it
any
longer.
They
can't
afford
it?
We
can't
afford
it.
It's
another
customer
gone.
And
four
mouths
to
feed.

Well.
It's
two
meals
a
day
from
now
on,
not
three.
That's
all
there
is
to
it.

I've
made
you
a
suit.
I
want
you
to
wear
it
on
your
14th
birthday.
You'll
be
back
then,
Papa.
Won't
you?

ROSA:
Hans!
Rosa...
I'm
asking
you,
I'm
begging
you...
would
you
please
I
brought
you
something.
-
Is
this
today's?
A
gift
from
Franz
German.
That
boy
doesn't
know
how
generous
he
is.
"Hitler
poised
to
take
Moscow."
The
world
has
turned
mad.
But...
aren't
we
winning
the
war?
Max?
Where's
my
weather
report?
You're
full
of
wonders.
I've
got
an
idea.

What
on
earth
are
you
doing?


Go,
go,
go!
Max.
I
have
no
more
snow!
LIESEL:
Get
him,
Max!
ROSA:
What
in
God's
name
Rosa!
There's
a
madwoman
I'm
unarmed!

This
is
the
stupidest
thing
And
look
how
happy
you
are.
What
do
we
do
when
it
melts?
You
mop
it
up,
Saumensch.
It
won't
melt.
it's
freezing
down
here.
I
don't
know
how
you
do
it
every
night.
Please,
don't
think
about
me.
Nonsense.
We
all
think
about
you.
This
is
the
best
Christmas.
This
is
my
first
Christmas.
Now
you
know
We
should
call
it
a
night.
No,
Papa.
Please.
ROSA:
Listen
to
your
father.
You
can
stay
a
little
longer.
Oh,
you're
too
soft
on
that
girl.
I've
made
you
a
Christmas
gift.
It's
all
I
had.
But...
Open
it.
"For
Liesel...
"from
Max."
What
does
it
say?

"Write."
In
my
religion...
we're
taught
that
every
living
thing...
every
leaf,
every
bird...
is
only
alive
That's
the
only
difference
between
Words
are
life,
Liesel.
All
those
blank
pages...
they're
for
you
to
fill.


My
God.
Is
he
going
to
die?
Shut
up!
I
won't
have
that
talk
I
haven't
starved
us
all
just
so
that
he
could
die.
It's
my
fault.
Why
is
it
your
fault?
It
was
my
idea
to
build
that
snowman.
Why
did
we
build
it?
Because
we
had
to.
You
said
you
weren't
going
anywhere,
Max.
You
promised.
"The
Invisible
Man...
"by
H.G.
Wells."
"The
stranger
came
early
in
February...
"one
wintry
day...
"through
a
biting
wind
and
a
driving
snow.
"The
last
snowfall..."
"And
none
other
will
know
of
them...
"until
he
dies."
"The
End."
Max?
"Chapter
One."


Ilsa?

LIESEL:
"The
eyes
in
the
faces
"seemed
to
look
inside
him
"But
things
were
out
of
his
control.
"He
had
cut
himself
loose...
"and
was

the
dustiness

the

realization

Did
you
lose
something?
What
are
you
doing?
Spying
on
you,
obviously.
Give
me
that!
So,
let
me
guess.
I've
got
to
hand
it
stealing
from
the
Burgermeister.
Keep
it
down.
I'm
not
stealing.
I'm
borrowing.
Whatever
you
are
"borrowing"...
I
just
wish
you
let
me
in
on
it.
It's
not
what
you
think.
Then...
what
is
it?
I'm
borrowing
books.
That's
all.
Books?
Are
you
nuts?
We
are
starving
out
here
Stop
using
that
word.
How
about
food?
Did
you
ever
even
think
No.
We
could
have
I'm
sorry.
I
couldn't.
You
know,
for
a
best
friend,
What's
that
supposed
to
mean?
Who's
Max?
Who
is
he?
Liesel!
Tell
me
what's
going
on!
Te“
ma,
Saumensch,
who
is
he?
Is
he
your
boyfriend?
What?
Is
that
what
you
think?
Then
what?
Tell
me,
who
is
he?
I
can't.
Why
not?
It's
a
secret.
You
don't
trust
me?
It's
not
like
that,
Rudy.
I
can't.
If
I...
lf
l
told
you,
I'd
have
to
go
away.
Papa
would
have
to
go
away.
God
knows
what
would
happen
to
him.
"Him"?
You're
hiding
someone?
You're
hiding
someone,
aren't
you?
Liesel!
One
spit,
"Yes."
Two
spits,
"No."
I
knew
it.
No
one
can
know,
Rudy.
I
mean
it.
You
can
trust
me.
Don't
worry.
I
won't
tell
anybody.
You
won't
tell
anyone
what?
Hello,
Steiner.
Hello,
Fool
What's
that
behind
your
back?
Give
it
to
me.
LIESEL:
Leave
him
alone!
I
said,
give
it
to
me!
Give
it
to
me!
What
was
that?
What
was
it?
None
of
your
business,
German.

LIESEL:
Leave
him!
You're
done
for,
Steiner.
I'm
reporting
you.
For
what?
Having
a
diary?
I
know
you're
up
to
something.
Come
on!
Come
on!
What
are
you
doing?
I
know
where
it
is!
I
watched
it!
It's
freezing,
Rudy.
You'll
die
in
there.
Rudy!
Rudy?
Rudy!
Rudy?
Rudy,
I
can't
swim!
Rudy!
Please!
Igor
it!
Rudy!
I
thought
you
were...
Never
mind.
Trust
me
now?
Yes.
Then,
how
about
that
kiss?
Come
on.
You're
going
to
freeze.
Good
night...
book
thief.
Good
night,
fish.
I
told
Rudy.
-
Here,
come
on!

Look!
LIESEL:
What
are
they
doing?
Checking
basements.
For
what?
Can
we
get
on
with
it
now?
BOY
1:
Come
on!
BOY
2:
Here!
Pass
it!
RUDY:
Are
you
nuts?
I
have
to
go
inside.
Oh,
great.
RUDY:
She's
hurt.
Never
stopped
her
before.
I'm
fine.
-
Mama!
They're
coming.
Who?
They're
checking
basements.
Hans,
come
quickly!
-
What
is
it?
They
are
checking
basements.
We
have
to
hide
him.
Get
him
up
here,
under
the
bed.

-Max!
Max!
Come
on.
Come
on.
So,
do
they
give
you
a
gun
Mama!
Oh,
my
God.
Hans,
leave
that!

Wolfy.
What
a
surprise.
How
are
you?
You
want
Hans?
Hans!
No,
No,
No.
Oh,
Liesel,
will
you
get
Herr
Edel...
-a
glass
of
water?
This
shouldn't
take
a
second.
You
should
bandage
that.
Oh,
my
God,
Liesel!
Yes!
and
get
me
Where
is
the

The

The
door
to
your
basement.

Ah!
Wolfa.
I
heard
you
were
coming.
Heard
from
who?
Who
was
it
collecting
our
washing?
Frau
Schneider.
Frau
Schneider,
fa.
She
mentioned
it.
Come.
WOLFGANG:
ls
there
a
light
in
here?
HANS:
Yes,
of
course.
I
should
probably
You
wouldn't
believe
what
we
Oh,
it
wouldn't
surprise
me.
Liesel,
she
is
always
playing
down
here.
I
keep
telling
her
to
get
out
in
the
fresh
air.
What
is
this
about,
anyway?
WOLFGANG:
What's
this?
My
brushes.
You
should
look
after
them
better.
Liesel,
you
know,
she
never
listens
to
me.


Still
no
work,
eh,
Hans?
Not
a
lot.
You
should
have

your
wife
wouldn't
washing
people's
underwear
to
feed
you.
Isn't
that
right,
Rosa?
Yes.
What's
wrong
with
you?
I've
never
heard
you
to
give
this
one
some
lip.

Well...
if
the
Saukerl
would

give
him
all
the
lip
that
he
deserves.

I
don't
know
how
you
live
with
her.
Neither
do
I.
Never
too
late
to
join,
Hans.
So,
how's
our
basement?
Perfectly
useless.
The
ceiling
is
too
low.
What
for?
Air
raid
shelters.
You
should
be
more
careful.
Yes,
Herr
EdeL.
Hans...
What
if
he
does
die?
We
can't
just
leave
him
there.
The
smell
will
give
us
away.
Hans,
I'm
afraid.
Look,
if
it
happens...
if
he
dies...
we'll
simply
have
to
find
a
way.
He's
not
dead
yet.
All
right?

Frau
Hubermann?
I
need
to
speak
to
Liesel.
Of
course.
Liesel?
-
Ow!
What
did
you
do
with
it,
you
little
thief?
What,
Mama?
Don't
"what"
me.
I
have
told
you
a
hundred
times
to
leave
that
thing
alone,
but
do
you
listen?
TEACHER:
Back
to
work.
I'm
sorry.
Mama,
what
is
it?
It's
Max,
isn't
it?

He
said
that
this
belongs
to
you.
Who
said?
He
woke
up.
He's
going
to
live!
Mama!
Careful.
I'm
sorry
if
I
hurt
you.
I
couldn't
think
of
any
other
way
to
tell
you.
I
know
it's
silly
of
me.
I
know.
No,
Mama,
it's
not.
Thank
you.
Well,
you'd
better
Just
go
back
in
there...
and
act
like
I'm
the
witch,
you
know?
Yes?
Yes.
Just
know
that...
that
l
...
Go
on.
Do
you
need
a
bit
of
help
with
that
smile?
If
I
ever
catch
you...
doing
that
sort
of
thing
again,
so
help
me...
I
will
string
you
up
by
your
toes.
Do
you
hear
me,
Saumensch?
Understood?
Max!
Max!
I
knew
you'd
live.
With
all
that
reading,
You
heard
me?
Of
course.
Thank
you.
So...
How's
Rudy?
I
don't
know.
Rudy's
a
pain
in
the
neck.
The
only
thing
worse

ROSA:
Liesel,
it's
an
air
raid!
Go
on,
then.
What
about
you?
I'm
here.
I'll
be
fine.
It's
a
basement,
isn't
it?

Did
you
hear
me,
Saumensch?
Yes,
Mama.

I'm

you.

much.


He's
a
Jew.
They
found
his
birth
certificate.
He's
a

LEHMAN:
Please!
My

is
in
the

He's
fighting
on
the

Please!

I'm

Please...
I've
known

He's
a
good
person.
What's
your
name?
Hans
Hubermann.
-
Please!
He's
a
good
man.
LIESEL:
Papa!
Papa!
Liesel!
Rudy!
Rudy.
Keep
still.
What
was
I
thinking?
He
took
my
name.
Christ
on
the
cross,
what
have
I
done?

I've
ruined
us!
I've
ruined
us!
I'm
sorry,
Rosa.
I'm
sorry.
I
don't
understand.
What
did
he
do
so
wrong?
He
reminded
people
of
their
humanity.
Can't
he
apologize?
To
who?
Hitler?
Will
they
take
him
away?
I
don't
know.
But...
if
they
come
and
find
me
here...
they'll
take
all
of
you
away.
No,
Max.
I
have
to,
Liesel.
I'm
sorry.
But
you
promised.
It's
for
your
own
good.
For
your
family.
But
you're
my
family.
You've
kept
me
alive,
Liesel.
Don't
ever
forget
that.
I
can't
lose
someone
else.
I'm
not
lost
to
you,
Liesel.
You'll
always
be
able
That's
where
I'll
live
on.
Max...
please.
Thank
you.
Here.
It's
two
blankets
and
a
pair
of
socks.
And
a
nice
piece
of
cheese

it's
yours.
Come.

Leave
her.

Hans?
I'll

What?
I'm
here
to
talk
about
your
son,
Rudy.
Rudy
Steiner.
He
lives
next
door.
What
do
you
want
with
him?
He's
been
selected
for
elite
training.
He
starts
in
the
summer.
I'm
sorry,
Barbra.
Hans
Hubermann?

What's
"conscripted"?

Look
how
you've
grown.
I
had
not
noticed.
I
will
miss
you.
Everyone's
leaving.
Even
Rudy.
Rudy
is
going
to
be
fine.
Look
after
your
Mama,
fa?
I
know.
Good
girl.
Papa?
Come
home.

What
do
you
think?
LIESEL:
The
shoes
let
you
down.
And
the
face.
Coming?
Where
are
you
going?
Isn't
it
obvious?
I'm
running
away.
LIESEL:
Have
you
thought
this
through?
RUDY:
Yes.
I
don't
want
to
die.
There.
All
thought
through.
Rudy,
where
are
you
going
to
stay?
"You"?
What
about
"we"?
I
didn't
think
you
were
this
serious.
What
do
you
call
this?
Packed
lunch?
Is
there
anything
in
there
I
miss
my
dad.
I
don't
even
know
if
he's
alive.
I'm
not
ready.
I
want
to
grow
up
before
I
die.
So
did
my
brother.
I'm
sorry.
I
didn't
ask
for
this.
Who
would?
I
hate
Hitler.
Me,
too.
I
hate
Hitler!
I
hate
Hitler!
I
hate
Hitler!
-
I
hate
Hitler!
Stick
you,
Hitler!
You're
all
I've
got,
Rudy.
Let's
go
home.

Nothing.

is.
Me,
too.
I'm
not
sure
what
it
all
meant.
Everything
he
went
through.
Everything
we
did.
We
were
just
being
people.
That's
what
people
do.
Liesel...
you
are
all
grown
up.
LIESEL:
AH
I
have
So
I
had
better
get
started.
I
have
always
tried
to
ignore
it...
but
I
know
this
all
started
with
a
train...
and
some
snow...
and
my
brother.
Outside
the
car,
And
on
a
place
called
Heaven
Street...
a
man
with
an
accordion
waited
for
their
new
daughter.

He
lived
under
our
stairs
until
the
sun
forgot
what
his
face
was.
The
book
floated
down
the
river...
like
a
red
fish
being
chased
For
Max,
who
gave
me
eyes.
Good
night,
Your
Majesty.
NARRATOR:
I've
always
quite
liked
Dark
and
formidable.
Unfortunately,
I'm
far
more
No
one
intended
to
destroy
It
was
a
misread
on
a
map.
No
sirens
that
evening.
First
were
Rudy's
brothers.
I
read
their
simple
dreams.
Then,
I
kissed
his
mother.
And
stole
the
meanness
Rosa,
I
caught
mid-snore.
I
could
swear
I
heard
her
call
me
a
bastard.
Then
I
felt
her
regrets
As
for
Hans,
his
soul
was
I
felt
his
itch
and
heard
his
final
thought...
"Lies
e].
"

Over
here!
Just
over.
Your
hand.
Mama?
Papa?
Papa?
Papa.
Rudy?

Saumensch.
Liesel.

I
need
to
tell
you...
Don't
speak.
I
need
to
say
it.
L...
Rudy?
Rudy,
No.
Rudy,
wake
up.
Rudy,
No!
Wake
up,
Rudy!
Rudy,
wake
up!
Rudy,
kiss
me.
NARRATOR:
Rudy,
his
sou!
In
my
job,
lam
always
finding
and
their
wars
t.
I
see
their
ugliness,
and
their
beauty...
and
I
wonder

Liesel!


Max!
NARRATOR:
I
have
seen
I've
attended
and
worked
for
the
greatest
of
villains.
And
I've
seen
the
greatest
wonders.
But
it's
still
like
I
said
it
was.
No
one
lives
forever.
When
I
finally
came
for
Liesel...
I
took
selfish
pleasure
in
the
knowledge
that
she
had
lived
her
90
years
so
wisely.
By
then,
her
stories
Some
of
whom
I
came
to
know
in
passing.
Max,
whose
friendship
lasted
Almost.
In
her
final
thoughts...
she
saw
the
long
list
of
lives
Her
three
children.
Her
grandchildren.
Her
husband.
Among
them,
lit
like
lanterns...
were
Hans
and
Rosa...
her
brother...
and
the
boy
whose
hair
I
wanted
to
tell
the
book
thief
she
was
one
of
the
few
souls...
that
made
me
wonder
what
it
was
to
live.
But
in
the
end,
there
were
no
words.
Only
peace.
The
only
truth
I
truly
know...
is
that
I
am
haunted
by
humans.
