Get
in
there!
Spyglass,
this
is
cobra
one.
Open
bravo
south.
Over.
You
bitches!
You
bad
man!
You
got
to
shoot
them
in
the
head!
You
torture
me...
I
torture
you!
12-hour
rotations.
Suicide
watch
every
3
minutes.
Do
not
let
that
repetition
lower
your
guard.
That's
exactly
what
these
guys
are
looking
for.
You
got
to
remember...
some
of
these
dudes
have
been
locked
up
in
here
for
eight
years.
They've
been
in
here
before
some
of
you
were
even
in
high
school.
They
know
the
procedure
better
than
you
do.
They
will
test
you,
and
they
will
best
you.
And
make
no
mistake
about
it...
this
is
a
war
zone.
Now,
they
ain't
using
roadside
bombs,
and
we're
not
using
f-16s.
This
is
still
a
war
zone.
Now...
Some
of
you
might
think
you're
here
to
prevent
them
from
leaving.
You're
not.
The
walls
do
that
for
us.
You
are
here
to
prevent
them
from
dying.
Yes?
Uh,
how
often
do
we
move
the
prisoners?
Detainees.
What?
You
will
refer
to
them
as
"detainees."
You
will
not
call
them
"prisoners."
You
all
got
that?
No
exceptions.
De-tai-nees.
Why
can't
we
call
them
prisoners?
Prisoners
are
subject
to
the
geneva
convention...
detainees
are
not.
Rec
yard
is
right
down
there.
Showers
are
right
beside
'em.
Unless
they're
going
to
medical,
being
transferred...
that's
it.
That's
their
world.
Is
that
door
shut?
Good.
This...
this
is
your
world.
No
detainees
back
here.
On
your
right,
gun
sally.
Remember,
on
the
walk,
the
only
weapon
you
have
is
your
radio.
Don't
be
afraid
to
use
it.
Over
here,
this
is
our
security
command
or
observation...
our
eyes
and
ears
on
the
whole
block.
So
if
you
find
yourself
going
up
against
an
uncooperative
detainee,
remember
you're
being
watched.
Last
but
not
least,
the
mess
hall.
Like
most
places
on
earth,
the
chicken
fingers
are
the
only
thing
worth
eating.
Hard
to
fuck
those
up.
And
don't
bother
telling
me
the
coke's
flat
'cause
I
already
fucking
know.
Echo
one,
cobra
one,
charlie
bronson.
I'll
say
again.
Hold
on...
the
natives
is
getting
restless.
Over.
Roger,
echo
one.
Charlie
bronson,
echo
one.
Oscar
mike,
over.
"Charlie
bronson's"
our
brevity
code
for
an
irf...
that's
initial
reaction
force.
It's
a
four-man
team
called
in
when
shit
hits
the
fan
on
the
walk.
Anybody
feel
like
getting
their
feet
wet?
Listen.
All
you
need
to
worry
about
is
his
right
hand,
okay?
Each
of
us
takes
one.
Leg,
leg,
arm,
head.
Don't
worry
about
nothing
else.
You
just
keep
your
eye
on
his
right
hand,
and
you
gain
control
of
it...
got
it?
Roger.
And
stay
behind
me.
Let
us
get
the
rest
of
him
under
control.
Hold
up.
Hold
up.
No
names
on
the
block.
Yeah.
Okay?
Yeah.
You
can
talk
to
'em,
but
do
not
let
these
guys
know
anything
about
you.
Do
not
let
them
get
inside
your
head.
You
got
it?
Yeah.
All
right,
grab
our
shields.
Let's
go.
Spyglass,
pop
1-9.
Stay
tight.
Stay
tight,
all
right?
We
got
this.
Detainee,
get
back!
Get
back,
detainee!
Get
back!
Get
him
pinned
up.
Let's
go.
Go!
Come
on.
Private,
give
me
those
cuffs!
Shit!
Get
your
ass
down!
Ohh!
You
piece
of
shit!
Get
his
arm
back!
Get
him
on...
get
down,
you
piece
of
shit!
Get
his
other
hand.
Get
the
fuck
up.
Out
of
here...
get
him
out
of
here.
That's
it...
get
down.
All
right,
pull
that
strap
down.
You
want
his
hand
all
the
way
secure.
Make
it
as
tight
as
you
can.
Check
his
waist.
Check
the
belt
around
his
waist.
Check
that
side.
We
don't
want
this
guy
going
anywhere
on
us.
Let's
roll
him
out.
Welcome
to
gitmo.
Oh,
jackson,
did
you
copy
those
dvds
for
me?
And
when
exactly
was
I
supposed
to
do
that?
I
mean,
I
had
c.O.
Standing
over
my
shoulder
all
day.
Dude,
what
the
fuck?
Johnson
is,
like,
up
my
ass
about
getting
it
back.
Copy
that
shit
for
me.
Wait.
Don't
you
got
kids,
anyway?
Why
don't
you...
Yeah.
You
ass.
So,
what...
I
can't
watch
porn?
Are
you
telling
me
your
dad
didn't
have
a
stack
of
nudie
mags?
He'd
to
have
something
to
put
over
your
mom's
face.
Oh!
Oh,
you're
so...
That's
cold.
That's
cold
as
ice.
You
all
right?
Yeah.
I'm
good.
Thanks.
Yo,
what
was
that
irf
like?
Loud.
Shit.
You
didn't
think
I
could
handle
it?
No,
that's
not
what
I'm
trying
to
say.
You
know,
I
just
didn't
think
you'd
want
to.
I
got
to
say,
of
all
the
companies
I've
rotated
through
here,
I
never
had
someone
get
their
ticket
punched
on
the
first
day.
Just
be
glad
it
wasn't
a
shit
cocktail.
What's
a
shit
cocktail?
What
the
fuck
do
you
think
that
is,
rico?
Hey,
cole,
what
happened?
Uh.
We...
we
followed
two
other
guys
in,
and,
um,
I
was
on
the
left
arm.
It
was
my
only
thing,
and
I
went...
pop!
She
got
an
elbow
right
to
the
lip...
knocked
her
mask
clean
off.
Ohh,
does
it
hurt?
Yeah,
it
fucking
hurts.
It
looks
pretty
bad.
Did
medical
check
it
out?
It's
fine.
You
know
what
it
looks
like?
It
looks
like
you
got
herpes.
Hey,
no.
Oh,
shit!
It
kind
of
does.
You
guys.
No.
You're
not
gonna
get
any
on
the
island
now,
cole.
Fuck
that...
I'd
hit
it,
anyway.
What
do
you
say,
cole?
Well,
then,
I
really
would
get
herpes.
Ohh!
Thank
you!
She
got
you...
Oh,
damn.
Whoo!
Mom?
Oh!
Honey,
how
are
you?
Well,
things
are
fine.
Um,
the
base
is
real
nice.
There's
a
subway.
A
subway?
A
subway
restaurant,
mom.
Oh!
Yeah.
And
is
that
your
room?
Yeah.
Can
I
see
it?
How
is
everything
back
home,
mom?
Oh.
Nothing
much
ever
happens
back
here...
nothing
as
exciting
as
what
you're
doing,
i'm
sure.
It
is
what
it
is.
I
don't
know.
I,
um...
Honey,
you
can't
just
leave
him
hanging
and
expect
him
to
be
there
when
you
get
back.
I'm
not
leaving
him
hanging,
and
I
told
you
I'm
not
coming
back.
I'm
going
on
another
deployment,
remember?
All
right.
So,
how
about
on
the
base?
Have
you
met
anyone
down
there?
Mom,
seriously,
stop.
I'm
not
dating
an
army
guy,
and
I
did
not
join
the
military
to
find
a
husband.
Oh,
yeah.
Oh!
Look
who
wants
to
say
hello.
Say
hi,
scribbles.
Look
who
it
is!
Look
who
it
is!
Say
hi,
scribbles.
The
weather
today...
bright
and
sunny.
High
of
85...
Tomorrow,
there
is
a
chance
of
rain...
Thank
you,
private.
Last
week...
Come
down
here.
Make
sure
you...%-
uh.
You
want
a
book?
Do
you
want
a
book?
Hey,
calm
down.
Calm
down.
Take
a
step
back.
Take
one
step
back
from
the
glass.
I
can't
understand
what...
yo,
haji!
Chill
the
fuck
out.
I'll
take
that
book,
but
you
give
it
to
me.
All
right,
all
right.
Chill
out.
I
got
this.
Did
I
do
something
wrong?
No.
These
guys
just
don't
like
girls.
It's
an
arab
thing.
You
want
me
to
take
over?
No.
It's
okay.
I
can
handle
it.
All
right.
Suit
yourself.
Do
you
know
those
books?
What
about
them?
Do
you
like
them?
You
were
watching
the
books.
I'm
asking
you
a
question.
What
do
you
want
from
the
cart?
Do
you
have
the
new
harry
potter
book?
No.
This
is
not
the
new
harry
potter
book.
This
is
the
old
one.
I
already
read
this
one.
I
want
the
last
book.
Which
one's
that?
The
last
book?
It's,
you
know...
you...
you
see
that
book
there?
It
has
no
cover
on
it,
huh?
Uh-huh,
yes.
That
book...
it
used
to
have
a
cover.
I
remember
I
read
this
cover,
you
know,
when
it
has
a
cover
on
it.
It
was
saying
that
harry
potter,
it
has
seven
book,
you
know?
You
guys
only
have
six
book.
Huh?
I
don't
know
what
to
tell
you...
I...
you
know
how
long
I'm
asking
for
this
book?
No,
you
don't.
You're
new.
Two
years.
Imagine,
two
years
I'm
asking
you
guys
to
give
me
this
last
book.
You
know
what
happens
at
the
end
of
book
six?
No.
No.
I...
you
know,
me,
always,
always
thinking
that
snape
is
a
bad
guy,
okay?
Then
I
was
thinking,
no,
actually,
he
is
not
a
bad
guy...
he
is
the
good
guy.
Then
after
I
read
the
book
six,
I
don't
know
what
to
think
now.
Do
you
want
this
book
or
not?
You're
not
listening,
huh?
I
read
this
book...
No,
no.
You
are
not
listening
tome.
10
times.
I
read
this
book.
I
want
the
new
book.
I'm
telling
you
we
don't
have
it.
It
ain't
here.
What
we
have
is
on
the
cart.
What
do
you
want?
Give
me
the
"azkaban"
instead.
Is
that
one
of
these
arab
books?
"Prisoner
of
azkaban,"
book
number
three.
Yeah.
Here
you
go.
Hey.
What...
what...
what
else
do
you
got?
I
got
books,
and
I
got
newspapers.
Use
your
eyes.
I'm
using
my
eyes.
That
newspaper
is
two
months
old.
Now,
why
do
I
have
to
know
the
news
for
two
months
old?
So,
you're
good
then?
Hold
on
your
horses,
huh?
No
one
is
going
nowhere
here...
at
least,
I'm
not.
What
is
that
picture?
That
book.
No,
no,
go.
Go,
go.
Go.
Too
much.
Go
back.
Uh-huh.
What
is
it?
"My
antonia."
Is
it
a
good
book
or...
I
don't
know.
I
haven't
read
it.
Okay.
Just
tell
me
what
the
cover
says,
on
the
back.
"In
19th
century
nebraska,
the
spirited
daughter
of
an
immigrant..."
nebraska?
You
said...
what
was
it?
It...
it's
a
place
in
america.
Okay.
Uh-huh.
That...
what
kind
of
place
is
this?
Nebraska?
Flat.
Flat.
Time's
up.
Hey.
Keep
it
moving.
Hey,
I...
moptop?
Bad
timing,
okay?
Me
and
blondie...
we
were
having
a
very
beautiful
conversation.
Uh-huh.
And
you
come
here
always
trying
to
be
a
big
fucking
asshole.
You
know
what?
I
think
you
guys
don't
have
the
last
harry
potter
on
purpose.
You
like
to
drive
us
crazy.
But
I'm
not
going
crazy.
Huh?
Happy
me.
I'm
not
going
crazy...
not
me!
At
2100,
detainees
on
charlie
block
complained
of
a
foul-smelling
odor
coming
from
ventilation.
Maintenance
was
called.
At
2200,
detainee
9-1-2
was
found
with
seven
strings
of
different
colors.
He
appeared
to
be
weaving
them
together,
possibly
to
form
a
weapon.
At
0500,
detainee
4-9
was
transferred
to
medical
for
pain
in
the
abdomen.
Diagnosis
was
constipation.
We
have
3-6
moves
scheduled,
3-8
moves
completed.
All
detainees
accounted
for.
Atten-hut!
Honor
bound.
To
defend
freedom.
Hey,
blondie,
tell
me...
how
do
you
like
it
here
so
far?
Huh?
Blondie.
Where
are
you
from?
Okay,
tell
me
your
name.
No?
My
name
is
ali...
ali
amir.
Here,
they
call
me
4-7-1.
You
don't
like
to
talk?
Always,
it's
like
that.
Why?
I
don't
know
why
you
guys...
you
don't
like
to
talk
with
us.
You
and
us...
we
are
both
stuck
here.
It
is
boring
for
both
of
us.
And
you
and
me
got
nothing
to
say
to
each
other.
Okay.
You
don't
like
to
read
harry
potter
book?
You
don't
like
to
read
that
book
about...
what
was
that
place,
the
flat
place?
Uh,
nebraska?
Tell
me
what
you
like
to
read,
huh?
Oh!
You
are
a
soldier.
And
soldiers...
they
don't
like
books.
I
thought
you
only
read
the
qur'an.
The
qur'an,
yes.
We...
I-I've
read
it
one
million
times.
You
know
what?
Ehan,
there
in
108...
he
has
memorized
it,
the
whole
book.
Hey,
ehan!
Tell
something
to
blondie
from
the
qur'an.
I
think
he's
trying
to
tell
you
to
leave
me
alone.
Ehan!
Hey,
blondie.
You
know,
I
read
your
bible,
too.
My
opinion
about
bible
is
the
first
half
of
the
book...
it
is
very
good.
It
has
armies,
plenty
of
magic,
which
I
like
very
much...
things
like
that.
But,
you
know,
the
second
half...
it
has
some
magic,
but
not
too
much.
It
is
boring.
Well,
you
don't
diss
my
holy
book...
I
won't
diss
yours.
So
you're
christian?
Tell
me
something...
how
did
you
pick
your
christianity?
It
was
your
parents,
hmm?
And
cut
the
hannibal
lecter
shit.
Just
keep
it
down.
What?
What
is
hannibal
lecter?
I
said,
keep
it
down.
Yeah.
I'm...
I'm
trying
to
understand
what
you
are
telling
me.
You
were
saying
that
stop
hannibal
lecter,
so
I
have
to
know
what
hannibal
lecter
is,
then
I
stop
doing
that.
He's
a
guy
in
a
movie
that
talks
too
much.
I
haven't
heard
about
this
movie.
Well,
it's
probably
banned
where
you're
from,
anyway.
You
mean
in
germany?
Huh?
I'm...
hey.
I'm...
hey!
I'm
talking
with
you,
blondie!
Okay.
I-I-it's...
it's
no
more
talking,
huh?
Huh?
You
are
always
trying
to
be
all
of
you
assholes.
I
don't
know
how
I
cannot
get
one
soldier
here
who
likes
to
talk
about
books.
Okay.
You
don't
like
to
talk.
Bring
me
some
water,
please.
Blondie.
I'm
thirsty.
Where's
your
qur'an?
Are
you
giving
me
some
water,
please,
or
not?
Okay,
you
bring
me
the
water...
I
stop
talking,
I
promise.
You
wouldn't
need
this
if
you
didn't
talk
so
damn
much.
Ah!
Shit.
Shit.
Are
you
all
right?
Oh,
man,
let
me
help
you.
Motherfucker.
Clean
yourself
up.
We'll
take
care
of
this.
Hey,
back
the
fuck
up
and
shut
the
bean
hole.
He's
probably
got
another
cocktail.
Oh,
fuck.
Quiet
down.
4-7-1,
take
the
towel
down
now.
Fuck
you!
Take
it
down
now!
No,
no.
We
need
to
call
an
irf.
Hold
on.
Open
that
thing.
No,
no.
No.
We
need
to
call
an
irf.
Calm
down.
I'm
already
covered
in
his
shit!
Open
it
up!
We
are
not
opening
the
fucking
bean
hole.
Now,
you
need
to
calm
down.
No,
we
are
not
opening
that
up.
You
stupid
fuckers...
Huh?!
I
went
to
university!
I
know
my
rights!
Hey,
back
up,
fucker!
Shit.
One
more
time.%-open

skippy.
Get
undressed.
Clock's
ticking.
Get
your
pants
off.
And
shorts
off.
Come
on.
Get
your
fucking
shorts
off.
Get
your
fucking
shorts
off,
or
I'll
call
in
an
irf
and
we'll
get
them
to
take
them
off
for
you.
Get
them
off.
You
guarding
the
fence,
or
you
guarding
him?
This
is
completely
out
of
line.
Let
me
ask
you
something...
are
you
a
soldier,
or
are
you
a
female
soldier?
'Cause
I
don't
have
these
kind
of
problems
with
soldiers.
You
got
to
watch
him.
That's
your
job.
Look
at
him.
Hey,
cole,
I
thought
that
was
you.
What
are
you
doing
back
here?
Drinking.
No
shit.
What's
wrong?
You
had
a
bad
day
or
something?
Not
particularly.
Not
as
bad
as
yours,
I
hear.
What
do
you
mean?
I
heard
some
detainee
just
covered
his
cell
on
feces.
Probably
wasn't
fun.
When...
today?
On
delta
pod?
No,
it
was
just
pretty
quiet
all
day.
Yeah.
Must
have
been
another
pod.
No,
nothing
like
that
happened
on
any
of
the
pods.
If
it
did,
I
would've
saw
it.
Come
in,
boys!
It's
shot
time!
That's
what
I'm
talking
about!
Oh,
hey.
What
do
you
want?
Jackie
chan
got
one.
Shh!
Shh!
I'm
not
following
you
here.

Soldiers
shouting
cadences

Private
first
class
cole
reporting
as
ordered,
sir.
At
ease.
Have
a
seat,
private.
Candy?
No,
thank
you,
sir.
I've
read
your
report.
I've
also
spoken
to
corporal
ransdell.
In
your
report,
you
say
that
you
were
escorting
a
detainee
to
the
showers
after
rec...
is
that
correct?
Affirmative.
And
you
filed
the
report
because
this
was
uncomfortable.
Well...
No,
I-it
made
him
uncomfortable.
Who?
The
detainee.
So
you
filed
against
a
fellow
soldier
because
the
detainee
was
uncomfortable?
It
was
not
the
proper
way
to
treat
him,
sir.
Did
the
detainee
take
a
shower?
Yes,
sir.
Sounds
like
he
wasn't
that
uncomfortable
with
it,
then.
It
was
a
blatant
violation
of
standard
operating
procedure,
which
is
why
I
filed
the
report.
Since
you
knew
what
was
happening
was
against
s.O.P.,
what
exactly
were
you
doing
there?
I
was
ordered
to
be
there,
sir.
Corporal
ransdell
gave
you
a
direct
order?
He
had
lied
about
being
shorthanded.
Did
he
order
you,
or
did
he
lie
to
you?
Sir...
'cause
it
seems
to
me
there'd
be
no
point
to
lie
to
you
if
he
simply
ordered
you.
He...
he...
and
there's
nothing
going
on?
You
don't
have
a
personal
relationship
with
him,
nothing
going
on
outside
the
wire?
No,
sir.
Is
that
what
he
told
you?
4-7-1,
the
detainee...
you
two
are
friends.
No,
sir.
You're
not
friendly
with
him?
No,
sir.
You
don't
talk
to
him?
We
have
spoken.
I
am...
Not...
I...
Like
I
said
in
my
report...
I've
read
your
report.
I
know
what
it
says.
I
also
know
what
corporal
ransdell
says
about
it.
But
what
I
don't
know
and
will
probably
never
know
is
what
is
really
going
on
here.
Do
you
like
it
here,
son?
Sir?
Do
you
like
it
here...
In
guantánamo
bay?
Yes,
sir.
It's
fine.
I
hate
it.
This
ain't
the
kind
of
post
a
guy
makes
his
stars
on.
Nobody
gives
you
a
medal
when
you
do
it
right...
they
just
give
you
a
demotion
when
you
do
it
wrong.
My
granddad...
he
flew
25
missions
over
germany,
blew
up
a
dozen
nazi
installments.
What
do
we
get?
We
get
to
babysit
a
bunch
of
sheep
farmers.
Like
I
said,
I
hate
it
here,
and,
yet,
here
I
am.
And
do
you
know
why?
I'm
here
because
my
commanding
officer
told
me
to
come
here.
Yes,
sir.
The
review
board
will
have,
uh,
a
hearing
for
both
of
you
next
month.
I
didn't
do...
you're
dismissed.
Yes,
sir.
Good
morning,
sir.
Hey.
Hey.
How's
your
enchilada?
It's
about
as
good
as
it
looks.
I
should
have
went
with
the
chicken
fingers.
Hard
to
mess
those
up,
right?
Hear
about
what
happened
on
delta
pod?
What?
Another
cocktail?
No.
A
dude
tried
to
hang
himself
last
night.
How?
It's
not
even
possible.
We
watch
these
guys
24-7.
No,
not
a
detainee.
It
was
a...
it
was
a
guard.
The
dude
tied
himself
off
to
a
ceiling
fan
and...
get
this...
the
piece
of
shit
pulled
out
of
the
wall.
Can
you
believe
that
shit?
The
dude's
life
got
saved
by
shitty
army
contractors.
It's
funny,
right?
He's
lucky.
It's
crazy
though,
right...
that
he
tried
to
kill
himself?
I
mean,
I
get
it.
It's
a
tough
mission,
you
know.
But
what
the
fuck,
man?
It's
our
fucking
job.
You
got
to
get
over
it,
you
know?
Yeah.
I
know.
It's
got
to
be
hard
for
some
people,
though.
It's...
It's
not
as
black
and
white
as
they
said
it
was
gonna
be.
What's
that
mean?
I
don't
know
what
he
was
expecting,
but
I'm
sure
it
wasn't
this.
Come
on,
though.
It's
not
as
bad
as
that.
A
lot
of
these
guys
aren't
even
that
tough.
Exactly.
Makes
you
feel
fucking
guilty.
It's
like...
Guilty?
Come...
what
the
fuck
you
got
to
feel
guilty
for?
No,
man.
Hell,
you
shouldn't
feel
guilty
about
shit.
These
motherfuckers
did
9/11,
and
now
they're
in
jail...
end
of
story.
The
motherfuckers
that
did
9/11
died
there.
You
know
what
your
problem
is?
You've
been
talking
too
much
to
the
fucking
translators.
They've
gotten
all
in
your
head,
and
you've
forgotten
how
lucky
you
really
are.
We
could
be
in
iraq
right
now.
You
realize
that?
I
mean,
you'd
rather
be
dodging
cocktails
than
bullets,
right?
No.
Whatever.
10
minutes,
faggots.
Smoke
'em
if
you
got
'em.
Hey...
You
smoke
now?
Yeah.
What
are
you
gonna
do,
cole?
Tell
on
it?
Based
on
the
detainees'
preferences...
Yo.
What's
up?
Here
you
go.
You've
been
transferred.
What?
Where?
Night
shift.
Yeah.
Just,
uh,
skip
tomorrow.
Rotate
in
on
the
next.
Your
new
o.I.C.
Will
come
get
you.
It's
all
there.
Why?
Why?
Shit,
cole.
You
know
ain't
no
why
in
the
army.
Hey.
Hey.
Is
that
clock
right?
Yeah.
So...
W-where
is
blondie?
Huh?
Detainee
1-0-8
was
heard
singing
a
song
in
arabic
that
had
the
english
words
"bin
laden"
in
it.
At
1700
hours,
detainee
9-1
complained
that
his
chow
smelled
rotten.
He
was
given
another
meal,
which
he
said
tasted
bad.
At
1900,
detainee
2-3-5
was
given
a
water
bottle.
He
drank
it,
asked
for
another,
and
proceeded
to
drink
six
more
bottles
in
the
span
of
five
minutes.
He
then
complained
of
feeling
bad.
We
had
2-5
moves
scheduled,
2-8
moves
completed.
Atten-hut!
Honor
bound.
To
defend
freedom.
Blondie?
Blondie?
It
is
you.
Hey,
don't...
don't
get
up.
Go
back
to
sleep.
No.
No.
No.
I-I-I-I
can
never
sleep
well...
you
know,
here,
anyway.
I
didn't...
I
didn't
know
they
kept
the
lights
on
all
night.
All
day
and
all
night.
How
is
it
that
you're
here?
I
mean,
uh,
you're
a
night
guard.
Oh.
Um,
I'm
sorry.
You
cannot
say.
I-it's
okay.
No.
Actually,
uh...
I
snitched
on
someone.
What...
what...
what
is
it...
snitch?
It's
like
golden
snitch
and...
No.
Um,
to
snitch
on
someone
is,
uh...
It's
to
tell...
like,
if
someone
does
something
wrong,
you
turn
them
in.
Who...
who
did
you
snitch
on?
I
can't
say.
It's
moptop,
huh?
What...
what
did
he
do
to
you?
You
should
get
some
sleep.
See
you
later.
I'm
not
gonna
tell
you
what
he
did.
Okay.
So,
tell
me
this
one...
how
did
you
end
up
here?
I
told
you...
they
reassigned
me.
No,
no.
How
did
you
end
up
here
in
this
place?
How
did
you
end
up
here?
Me?
How
did
I
end
up
here?
I
could
tell
you
that
I
was
not
with
al-qaeda
or
a
terrorist
or...
you
wouldn't
believe
me,
anyway.
Nobody
believes
me
here.
So
you're
from
germany?
Yeah.
You
remember.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
From
germany,
yeah.
Actually,
I
was,
you
know,
from
bremen.
Do
you
know
the
city...
bremen?
Bremen?
You
don't
know?
No.
I
can't
even
say
it.
Huh?
Sprechen
sie
deutsch?
No
speak
deutsch?
Mm,
dutch?
What?
Nein.
Um,
no.
Have
you
been
in
germany
before?
No?
No.
No.
No.
I'd
like
to...
plan
to.
So,
tell
me...
where
have
you
been?
I
mean,
you're...
you're
probably
gonna
laugh.
Me?
Laugh?
No.
At
you?
Uh,
I-I
never
laugh
at
you.
This
is
my
first
time
out
of
the
country...
I
mean,
it's
pretty
lame,
right?
No.
No,
it's
not.
It's...
you're...
you're
young.
You're
very
young,
and
you're...
you're
a
beginner,
huh?
Yeah.
There
are
more
people
on
this
base
than
in
my
hometown.
Small,
huh?
Yeah,
tiny...
gets
smaller
every
day.
And
is
this
the
reason
that
you
came
here?
Part
of
it,
yeah.
What
is
the
other
part?
A
lot
of
reasons.
Um.
I
wanted
to
do
something.
You
know,
I...
I
wanted
to
do
something
important.
Yeah.
I
understand.
Hey.
Thank
you.
It's
hard
making
the
switch,
huh?
Yeah,
it's
all
right.
It
takes
a
few
days.
Of
course,
uh,
you
won't
be
a
night
owl
for...
for
too
long,
right?
I
guess
not.
Or...
I
hated
the
day
shift...
bunch
of
detainees
chatting
your
ear
off.
I'd
hate
that.
Thanks
for
the
coffee.
Hey.
Are
you
still
awake?
What
day
is
today?
Wednesday.
No,
what
date
is
today?
Um,
july
14th.
So
you're
leaving
next
month?
Yeah.
How'd
you
know
that?
They
always
change
the
guards
in
august.
So,
when...
when
you
leave,
will
you
sign
up
again
here?
Like,
you
know,
there
are
guards
here
that
have
been
for
many
years.
No,
I
don't
think
so.
So
you
want
to
go
to
your
home,
your...
your
small
town?
No.
What
do
you
want
to
do,
then?
I
don't
know
yet.
Travel,
maybe.
Go
to
bremen.
I
don't
like
this
month.
Always
these
new
guards...
Treating
us
like
very
bad
guys.
They'll
learn...
Like
I
did.
What
did
you
learn?
Huh?
Tell
me.
You
must
learn
something,
huh,
when
I
throw
that
shit
on
you...
you
learned
something,
huh?
Or
when
we're
trying
to
kill
ourselves
here,
with
hunger
strike,
you
learned
something...
huh?...
You
said.
So
tell
me...
what
is
that?
I
want
to
know.
What
did
you
learn?
Only
you
think
you
know,
but
you
know
nothing.
You
know
nothing
about
me.
You
and
me...
We
are
at
war.
I
don't
see
it
like
that.
Then
you
see
nothing.
What
is
that?
Hey,
hey,
hey,
hey!
If...
if
you
call
on
your
radio,
you're
not
going
to
make
it.
You're
not
going
to
make
it.
Bring
it
down.
Bring
it
down.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Just
don't
do
anything
crazy,
okay?
You
think
I'm
crazy?
No.
No,
I
said
just
don't...
don't
do
anything
crazy.
Is
this
crazy
to
you?
If
you
was
me,
you
wouldn't
do
this?
Give
me
one
reason
why...
one.
Maybe
to
try
to
not...
not
die
in
this...
this
fucking
shithole.
I
don't
like
to
die
in
this
shithole!
But
one
way
or
another,
this
is
the
place
I
will
die.
Look,
you
don't
know
that.
You
can't
know
that.
Ali,
things
can
change.
Things...
things
can
always
change.
You...
you
can't
just,
uh...
you
can't
just
fucking
give
up.
You
got
to...
give
up,
blondie...
what
is
"give
up"?
Three
years
ago,
they
took
me
to
these
interrogations.
And
one
of
your
guys
here,
one
of
those
guys
who
don't
wear
uniform...
he
told
me
that
I'm
innocent.
He
told
me
that
he
knows
I'm
innocent,
but
I
still
cannot
go
home...
Because
there's
no
country,
no
city,
no
fucking
person
in
this
planet
will
take
me
because
I've
been
here.
I
have
no
place
to
go,
blondie.
This
is
the
only
thing
that
can
change
something.
Everything
okay?
Yeah.
Yeah,
everything's
fine.
Um.
My...
my
radio's...
it's...
it's
on
the
fritz.
Can
you
get
me
another
one?
Uh,
yeah.
Blondie,
you...
you
are
a
good
guy.
Yeah,
thanks.
Am
I
a
bad
guy
or
a
good
guy
to
you?
Ali...
It
doesn't
matter
right
now.
It's
the
only
time
it
matters.
So
you're
gonna
just...
you're
gonna
be
a
martyr?
Is
that
what
you
think
you're...
you
think
you're
gonna
go
to
heaven?
That's
what
you
want
to
do?
I
don't
believe
in
this
anymore.
Well,
then,
why
are
you
doing
this?
Look
at
me.
You're
asking
me
why
do
I
want
to
die,
but
you
don't
see
that
I'm
not
even
living.
You
guys
control
everything.
You
tell
us
what
to
eat,
when
to
sleep.
Even
when
we
don't
want
to
eat,
you
tell
me
we
must.
It
is
your
life...
it
is
not
ours.
I
don't
expect
you
to
understand
that.
I-I
like
you.
I
do.
But...
but
you'll
never
understand
this.
It's
amy.
You
keep
calling
me
"blondie,"
but...
My
name's
amy
cole
from
moore
haven,
florida.
And
I
like
you,
ali.
I
really
do.
Ah,
fuck!
Hey,
hey!
Is
there
a...
is
there
a
zoo
in
bremen?
What?
When
I
was
a
kid,
I
went
to
the
zoo
with
my
dad.
It
was
just
outside
where
we
lived
and,
uh...
It's
really
small,
one
of
those
zoos
where
they
keep
the
animals
locked
up
in
these...
these
tiny,
little
cages,
these
tiny,
little,
like,
concrete
boxes
with
tires
in
them
or
something.
I
was
really
excited
about
going.
I
really
wanted
to
see
something
outside
my
town.
I
wanted
to
be...
I
wanted
to
be
so
close
to
something
so
wild
and...
It
just
wasn't
okay.
I
didn't
I
didn't
like
it.
And
my
dad
kept
trying
to
fucking
tell
me
that
it
was
okay,
that...
that
this
lion
could
never
go
back
home
because...
because
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
survive
in
the
wild,
having
been
locked
up
for
so
long.
Okay.
You're
trying
to
tell
me
that
the
zoo
people...
they
are
not
guilty.
They
have
no
choice.
No.
I
thought
they
had
a
choice.
If
they
had
the
choice,
they
should've
given
it
to
him.
They
should
have
let
the
lion
choose.
You're
the
new
guy,
huh?
