Even
now
I
can
feel
it
Buried
somewhere
deep
inside.
...
watching
me.
...
waiting.
But
you
know
what
scares
me
the
most?
When
I
can't
fight
it
anymore...
...
when
it
takes
over
...
...
when
I
totally
lose
control
...
...
I
like
it.
Who
am
I?
You
sure
you
want
to
know?
The
story
of
my
life
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart.
If
somebody
said
it
was
a
happy
little
tale,
If
somebody
told
you
I
was
just
your
average
ordinary
Somebody
lied.
But
let
me
assure
you
This
like
any
story
worth
telling,
That
girl.
The
girl
next
door.

Mary
Jane
Watson.
The
woman
I've
loved
since
before
I
even
liked
girls.
I'd
like
to
tell
you
that's
me
next
to
her,
Aw
heck,
I'd
even
take
him.
Hey
stop
the
bus!

That's
me.
Tell
him
to
stop
please!
Hey
stop
the
bus!
Stop
the
bus!
He's
been
chasing
us
since
Woodhind
Blvd.
Thank
you.

Sorry
I'm
late.
Don't
even
think
about
it.
You're
so
lame
Parker.
Midtown
High
Seniors,
No
wandering.
Remember,
it
is
a
privilege
to
be
here.
We
are
guests
of
Columbia
University
Let's
not
have
a
repeat
of
our
C'mon
people,
let's
stay
together.
Dad
would
you
ask
Hoskins
to
drive
around
the
corner
please.
Why?
The
entrance
is
right
there.
Dad
these
are
public
school
kids,
You
want
me
to
trade
in
my
care
for
a
Jetta
just
because
It
wasn't
for
me.
Of
course
it
was.
Don't
ever
be
ashamed
of
who
you
are.
I'm
not
ashamed
of
who
I
am,
it's
just..
Forget
it.
Hey
Pete!
Hiya
Harry.
Harry!
Won't
you
be
needing
this?
Thanks
Dad.
Um,
Peter
may
I
introduce
my
father,
Norman
Oswald.
Peter,
I've
heard
so
much
about
you.
It's
a
great
honour
to
meet
you
sir.
Harry
tells
me
you're
quite
the
science
whiz.
Y'know,
I'm
something
of
a
scientist
myself.
I
read
all
your
research
on
nanotechnology.
Really
Brilliant.
And
you
understood
it?
Yes,
I
wrote
a
paper
on
it.
Impressive.
Your
parents
must
be
very
proud
of
you.
I
live
with
my
aunt
and
uncle,
they
are
proud.
Hey
you
two!
Let's
move!
Nice
to
meet
you.
He
didn't
seem
so
bad.
Not
if
you're
a
genius.
There
are
over
32,000
known
species
of
spiders
Wow,
that's
amazing!
This
is
the
most
advanced
It's
unreal.
Arachnids
from
all
three
groups

example,

we
have

spins

Leave
him
alone.
Or
what?
Or
his
father
will
fire
you

What's
Daddy
gonna
do?

Sue
me?
What
is
going
on?
The
next

who
talks
This

spider

using
a
set
of
that
some
researches
believe
it
-Those
guys
are
jerks.
Hey
look
at
that
spider.
Some
spiders
change
colours
to
blend
into
their
environment.
It's
a
defense
mechanism.
Peter,
what
makes
you
think
I
would
want
to
know
that?
Who
wouldn't?
Over
five
painstaking
years
Columbia's
genetic
research
facility
has...
Gonna
talk
to
her
now?
No,
go
on,
you
talk
to
her.
-Disgusting.
-I
love
'em.
You
know,
spiders
can
change
their
colour
to
blend
into
their
environment.
Really?
Yeah,
it's
a
defense
mechanism.
Cool.
...combining
the
genetic
information
from
all
three
spiders
into
these
fifteen
genetically
designed
super-spiders.
There's
fourteen.
I
beg
your
pardon?
One's
missing.
I
guess
the
researchers
are
working
on
that
one.
Did
you
know
that
this
is
the
largest
You
were
talking
throughout
this
entire
I
don't
know
what
it's
like
at
those
fancy
private
schools
but
...
Hey,
could
I
take
your
picture?
I
need
one
with
a
student
in
it.
Sure.
Yeah,
where
do
you
want
me?
Over
here?
Yeah,
yeah
that's
great.
Don't
make
me
look
ugly.
That's
impossible.
Perfect.
-That
good?
That's
great.

MJ,
let's
go.
Wait,
thanks!
Parker.

Let's
do
it.
We've
solved
the
horizon
glide.
And
the
multi-G
balance
issues.
I've
already
seen
the
glider.

That's
not
what
I'm
here
for.
General
Slocum,
good
to
see
you
again.
Mr.
Balkan,
Mr.
Farthus.
-Norman.
Always
a
pleasure
to
have
our
board
of
directors
pay
us
a
little
visit.
I
want
to
see
the
progress
report
on
Human
performance
enhancers.
We
tried
vapour
inhalation
with
rodent
subjects.
They
showed
an
800
percent
increase
in
strength.
Any
side
effects?
-In
one
trial
yes.
All
the
tests
since
then
have
been
successful.
And
in
the
trial
that
went
wrong
what
were
the
side
effects.
-Violence,
aggression
...
and
insanity.
That
was
only
one
test.
With
the
exception
of
Dr.
Strom
our
entire
staff
Dr.
Strom?
We
need
to
take
the
whole
line
back
to
formula.
Back
to
formula?
Dr.
Osbourne!

I'm
going
to
be
frank
with
you.
We
have
my
predecessor
to
thank
for
that.
Norman,
the
General
gave
the
go-ahead
to
request
aerospace
to
build
a
prototype
of
their
exoskeleton
design.
They
test
in
two
weeks.
And
if
your
so-called
performance

I'm
going
to
pull
your
funding.
I'm
going
to
give
it
to
them
Gentlemen,
ladies.
And
the
Lord
said,
"Let
there
be
light."
And
Voila!

There
is
light!
Forty
soft
glowin'
watts
of
it.
Oh
good
boy,
God
will
be
thrilled.

Just
don't
fall
on
your
ass.
I'm
already
on
my
ass,
May.
When
the

off
I
am

I'm

old
for

I
love
you

loves
you.

we've

well,
I'm
going
to

You
won't
have

No
thanks,

Dr.
Osbourne,
please.

The

aren't

The

doesn't
justify
this

I'm
asking
you
for
the
last
time.

We
can't
do
this.
Don't
be
a
coward.
Risks
are
part
of

science.
Look
let
me
reschedule.

With
the

staff
and

-If
you

me

We'll
have
lost

right?
I'm
fine.
Are

morning?
Change?
Well,
hurry
up!

You're
going
to
be
late.
Right.
-Goodness
me.
-I
thought
you
were
sick.
You
haven't
eaten
anything,
Yeah
I've
got
it.
Hey
Michaelangelo
don't
forget
-Got
it?
-Don't
start
without
me.
Teenagers,

hormones

You're
always

like

-I
have

Hi
MJ
...Hey
MJ,
I
don't
know
if
you
realize
and
I
was
wondering
if
maybe
we
could
get
or
I
don't
know,
I
thought
it'd
be
fun
to
get
to
know
each
other
...
...or
not...
Hey,
stop
the
bus.
Dad?
Dad,
are
you
all
right?
Harry,
...
What
are
you
doing
on
the
floor?
I
don't
know.
Have
you
been
there
all
night?
I
...
last
night
I
was
...
What?
I
don't
remember.
-Mr.
Osbourne.
-I'm
sorry
my
father's
not
feeling
well-
-What?
He's
been
murdered
sir.
What
are
you
talking
about.
-And
the
flight
suit
and
the
glider,--
It's
been
stolen,
sir.
Wow!
Great
reflexes.
-Thanks.
Hey,
blue
eyes.

I
didn't
notice
without
Well,
see
ya.
Parker?
Think
you're
pretty
funny
don't
you,
freak?
-Flash
it
was
just
an
accident.
-C'mon
Flash,
stop.
I
wouldn't
want
to
fight
me
neither.
Help
him
Harry.
Which
one?
All
yours
man.
Jesus
Parker,
you
are
a
freak.
Peter,
that
was
amazing.
Peter.
Go

Fly!

go!
Tally-ho...

Were
you
listening
to
that?
No.

Well,
I
heard
but
I
was
just
taking
out
the
trash.
I
guess
you
can
always
hear
us.
Well,
everybody
shouts.
Your
aunt
and
uncle
don't.
Oh,
they
can
scream
pretty
good
sometimes.
Listen,
MJ,
about
today
...
at
school
with
Flash
...
You
really
freaked
us
out.
I'm
sorry.
Is
he
ok?
He's
just
happy
you
didn't
give
him
a
black
eye
for
graduation.
So
where
you
going
after
you
graduate?
I
want
to
move
into
the
city
and
hopefully
get
a
job
as
a
photographer.
Work
my
way
through
college.
What
about
you?
Headed
for
the
city
too.
Can't
wait
to
get
out
of
here.
-I
wanna
...
C'mon,
try
me.
I
wanna
..
act.

On
stage.
Really?

That's
perfect.

You
were
awesome
in
all
the
school
plays.
Really?
Yeah,
I
cried
like
a
baby
when
you
played
Cinderella.
Peter,
that
was
first
grade.
Well,
even
so.
Sometimes
you
know
people.
You
can
just
see
what's
coming.
What
do
you
see
coming
for
you?
I
don't
know.

Whatever
it
is...
It's
something
I've
never
felt
before.
And
what
for
me?
For
you,
you're
going
to
light
up
Broadway.
You
know,
you're
taller
than
you
look.
I
hunch.
Don't.
Come
take
a
ride
in
my
new
birthday
present.
I
gotta
go.
Bye.
Oh
my
god,
gorgeous!
Look
at
it!
Hop
in.
Pretty
exciting
huh?
Don't
scratch
the
leather.
Cool
car.
Peter,
what's
going
on
in
there?
I'm
exercising.

I'm
not
dressed
Aunt
May.
Well,
you're
acting
so
strangely
Peter.
Ok,
thanks.

Something's
bothering
him.
Maybe
I'm
too
embarrased
to
ask
him.
I
don't
know,
I
just
don't
know
anymore.
I'm
going
to
the
downtown
library,
I'll
see
you
later.
-Oh,
wait
Pete!
I'll
drive
you
there
buddy.
-No
I
need
the
exercise.

Just
go
on,
go
go
go.
-Thanks
for
the
ride
Uncle
Ben.
-We
can
talk
later.
What
do
we
have
to
talk
about,
why
now?
Because
we
haven't
talked
at
all
for
so
long,
You
shirk
your
chores,
you
have
all
-You
start
fights
at
school.
-Well
you
sure
as
hell
finished
it.
No,
no
you're
not
supposed
to
run
away.
But,
Pete
look,
you're
changing.

I
know,
I
No,
Not
exactly.
Peter,

are
the
years

Stop

Cut

You
could
have
taken
that

apart.

Now
he's
going

I
missed

my
problem.
You

He's
headed
south

We
got
three
cars
in
pursuit.
Who's
there?
Don't
hurt
me.
Just
give
me
a
chance.
Just
give
me
a
chance!
What
about
my
Uncle?
Did
you
give
him
a
chance?!
Did
you?!
Stop
that
guy!
Thanks.
See

Freeze!
We've

completely
surrounded!

evening
General.-

Slocum.
If
it
does

you
say
it
can
I'll
sign
that
contract
tomorrow.
I
assume
you're
confident
about
this
test.
Absolutely,
Captain
Curtis
is
our
top

Now
what
about
your
commitment
to
Oscorp?
Nothing
would
please
me
more
than
to
put
Norman
Osbourne
out
of
business.
We
are
picking
up
an
unidentified
object
closing
fast.
What
the
hell
is
that?
Can
you
see
anything?
Oh
my
God!
-Say
chess.
Oh
Darling,
I'm
so
proud
of
you,
you
look
so
handsome
up
there.
Pete.
Good
news.
My
Father
got
the

in
New

we're
all
set

Oh
that's
great!
You
made
it.
It's
not

I've
been
proven
wrong.
-Congratulations.
Peter.

The
science
award.
-That's
terrific.
I
know
this
has
been
a
difficult
time
for
you.

But
I
want
you
to
try
to
enjoy
this
day.
Commencement,
the
end
of
one
thing.
The
start
of
something
new.
You're
like
a
brother
to
him,
that
makes
you
family.

And
if
you
ever
need
anything
just
give
me
a
call.
Can
I
fix
you
something.
No
thanks.
I
missed
him
a
lot
today.
I
know.
I
miss
him
too.
But,
he
was
there.
I
can't
help
thinking
about
the
last
thing
I
said
to
him.
He
tried
to
tell
me
something
important
and
I
threw
it
in
his
face.
You
loved
him
and
he
loved
you.
He
never
doubted
the
man
you
would
grow
into.

That
you
were
meant
for
great
things.
You
won't
disappoint
him.
'With
great
power
comes
great
responsibility'.

Remember
that
Pete.

Remember
that.
Hurry
up!
This
is
not
a
man.
My
brother
saw
him
building
a
nest
in
the
Lincoln
Center
fountain.
They
think
he's
human.

They
think
he's
a
man.

Could
be
a
woman.
Tommy,
get
a
load
of
this.
...the
ropes
come
out
and
he
climbs
up
the
ropes
like
a
spider
web.
I
see
the
web
and
it's
a
signature
and
I
know
Spiderman
was
here.
The
guy
protects
us.

You
know,
he
protects
the
people.
Some
kind
o'
freaky-loo
or
somethin'.
Wakadoo.
He
stinks
and
I
don't
like
him.
Don't
move!
Guy
with
8
hands.

Sounds
hot.
He
has
those
tights
and
tight
little--
We
should
all
just
give
him
one
big
hug
look
out
here
comes
the
Spiderman.
Who
is
Spiderman?!
He's
a
criminal,
that's
who
he
is.
A
vigilante.
What's
he
doing
on
my
front
page?
Mr.
Jameson
your
wife
is
on
line
one
she
needs
to
know
if--.
Mr.
Jameson
there's
a
page
six
problem.
-Well?!
-These
are
really
important
clients
they
can't
wait.
-He
pulled
six
people
off
that
subway
car.
Something
goes
wrong
and
this
creepy-crawler
is
there.
He's
not
fleeing,
he's
probably
going
to
Then
why's
he
wear
a
mask,
hmm?
What's
he
got
to
hide?
She
just
needs
to
know
if
you
want
the
chintz
or
the
chanel
in
the
dining
room.
Whichever
one's
cheaper.
Mr.
Jameson
it's
like
this,
we
double-booked
page
six.
-We
sold
out
four
printings.
Every
copy.
Tomorrow
morning.
Spiderman.
Page
one
with
a
Make
it
page
eight
and
give
'em
10
percent
off.
No
make
it
5
percent.
-That
can't
be
done
--
Problem
is
we
don't
have
a
decent
picture.
Eddie's
been
on
it
for
weeks,
we
can
barely
get
a
glimpse
of
him.
Aw,
what
is
he,
shy?
We
can
get
a
picture
of
Julia
Roberts
in
a
thong
we
can
certainly
get
a
picture
of
this
weirdo.
Put
an
ad
on
the
front
page.

Cash
money
for
a
picture
of
Spiderman.
He
doesn't
wanna
be
famous?

Then
I'll
make
him
infamous!
Hey!
Buzz
off!
MJ.
It's
me.
Peter.
Hi!
Hey.
What
are
you
doing
around
here.
I'm
begging
for
a
job.
How
about
you?
I'm
headed
to
an
audition.
An
audition?
So
you're
acting
now?
Yeah,
I
work
steady.
That's
great
MJ.
You're
doing
it.

You're
living
your
dream.
Hey
counter
girl!

Your
drawer
was
short
six
dollars!
Next
time
that
happens,
I'm
gonna
take
it
outta
your
cheque!
Excuse
me
Miss
Watson!

I'm
talkin'
to
you.
Hey!
Yes
Enrique,
I
get
you.
Well,
it
better
not
happen
no
more,
Some
dream
huh?
It's
nothing
to
be
embarrassed
about.
Don't
tell
Harry.
Don't
tell
Harry?
Aren't
you
guys
living
together?
Oh
yeah,
right.
I
think
he'd
hate
the
idea
of
my
waiting
tables.
He'd
think
it
was
low
or
something.
It's
not
low.
You
have
a
job.
Harry,
doesn't
live
on
a
little
place
I
like
to
call
earth.
No,
no
I
guess
not.
Thanks
Pete.
We
should
catch
up
sometime.
Let's
get
some
lunch
some
evening.
Uh,
I'll
come
by
and
have
some
of
your
moondance
coffee
some
day.
And
I
won't
tell
Harry.
No,
don't
tell
Harry.
I
won't.
I
won't
tell
Harry.
Stormin'
Norman's
making
his
weekly
inspection.
He's
spent
half
of
it
on
the
phone.
I'm
glad
you're
here.
I
need
your
help.
I'm
really
lost
here.
Are
you
all
right?
You
look
like
you
just
got
second
place
in
the
science
fair.
No
I,
uh,
was
late
for
work
and
Dr.
Connors
fired
me.
You
were
late
again?
I
don't
get
it.
Where
do
you
go
all
the
time?
Around.
Peter
Parker.
Maybe
you'll
tell
me
who
she
is.
Who's
that?
This
mystery
girl
Harry's
been
dating.

When
do
I
get
to
meet
her?
Oh,
sorry,
Harry
hasn't
mentioned
her.
Hey
Peter
you're
probably7
looking
for
a
job
now
right?
Dad
maybe
you
can
help
him
out.
No
I
appreciate
it
but
I'll
be
fine.
It's
no
problem.

I'll
make
a
few
calls.
No
I
couldn't
accept
it
sir.
I'd
like
to
earn
what
I
get.
I
can
find
my
own
work.
I
respect
that.
You
want
to
make
it
on
your
own
steam.
That's
great.
That's
great.
What
other
skills
do
you
have
Parker.
I
was
thinking
of
something
in
photography.
Hello.
Let's
go!
Let's
move
it!
Watch
the
street!
Cheese!
They're
crap.
Crap.
Crap.
Mega-crap.
I'll
give
you
200
bucks
for
all
of
'em.
That
seems
a
little
low.
Take
'em
somewhere
else
then.
Sir
your
wife
said
that
tile
you
want
in
the
foyer
is
out
of
stock.
Tell
her
we'll
just
put
a
rug
there.
Sit
down!
I'll
give
you
300.

That's
a
standard
freelance
fee.
-Tear
up
page
one.

Run
that
photo
instead.
-'Spiderman
Hero
or
Menace?
-Menace?
He
was
protecting
that--
That
ok
with
you.
Yes
sir.
Goodie.
Give
this
to
the
girl
up
front.
She'll
see
you
get
paid.
I'd
like
a
job
sir.
No
jobs.
Freelance!
Best
thing
in
the
world
for
a
kid
your
age.
Bring
me
some
more
shots
of
that
newspaper
selling
clown,
maybe
I'll
take
'em
off
your
hands.
But
I
never
said
you
have
a
job.
Meat!
I'll
send
you
a
nice
box
of
Christmas
meat.
Best
I
can
do.
Get
outta
here.

Bring
me
more
photos.
Hi.
Mr.
Jameson
told
me
to
give
that
to
you.
Oh,
welcome
to
the
Daily
Bugle.
Thank
you.
I'm
Peter
Parker.
I'm
a
photographer.
Yes,
I
can
see
that.
As
of
today,
Oscorp
Industries
has
surpassed
Quest
In
short
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
board,
costs
are
Wonderful
news
Norman.
Wonderful.
In
fact,
it's
the
reason
for
selling
the
company.
What?
Yes,
Quest
Aerospace
is
recapitalizing
in
the
wake
of
the
bombing.
Expanding.
They
made
a
tender
offer
that
we
can't
ignore.
Why
wasn't
I
told.
The
last
thing
they
want
is
a
power
struggle
with
entrenched
management.
The
deal
is
off
if
you
come
with
it.
The
board
expects
your
resignation
in
30
days.
You
can't
do
this
to
me.
I
started
this
company.
You
know
how
much
I
sacrificed?!
Oh
Max
please.
Norman,
the
board
is
unanimous.
We're
announcing
the
sale
after
the
World
Unity
Festival.
I'm
sorry.
You're
out
Norman.
Am
I?
Welcome
to
Oscorp
Industries'
Let's
hear
it
for
Macy
Gray!
MJ,
why
didn't
you
wear
the
black
dress?
It's
just,
I
wanted
to
impress
my
father.
He
loves
black.
Well,
maybe
he'll
be
impressed
no
matter
what.
You
think
I'm
pretty.
I
think
you're
beautiful.
MJ
would
you
do
me
a
favour?
I
forgot
my
drink
inside.
Oh
hi
Mr.
Fargus.

Have
you
seen
my
father
around.
Well,
I'm
not
sure
if
he's
coming
today.
What
is
that?
It
must
be
new
this
year.
That's
our
glider!
What
the
hell
was
that?
Ha
ha
ha
ha!
Oh
my
God!
Harry!
MJ!
OUT
AM
I!?
Hello
my
dear.
It's
Spiderman.
C'mon
move
kid.
Mommy!
Hold
it
right
there.
I
surrender.
Oh
boy.
Hold
it
right
there.
Impressive!
Help!
Mary
Jane!
Hold
on!
Watch
out!
We'll
meet
again
Spiderman!
Well,
beats
takin'
the
subway.
Don't
mind
us,
she
just
needs
to
use
the
elevator.
Wait!
Who
are
you?
You
know
who
I
am.
I
do?
Your
friendly
neighbourhood
Spiderman.
Incredible?
What
do
you
mean
he's
incredible?
No
alright.
Wait,
stay
there,
I'm
going
to
come
over.
No,
I'm
going
to
come
ove--alright
fine
will
you
call
me
in
the
morning.
And
we'll
go
and
have
breakfast
and
I
want
to
buy
you
something.
Because
I
want
to,
it'll
make
you
feel
better.
Ok,
and
what
do
you
mean
incredible.
Alright,
I'm
sorry.

Sleep
tight,
don't
let
the
bedbugs--
.
She's
alright.
She's
just
a
little
rattled.
Look
Pete,
I
should
have
told
you
about
us.
You
should
know
I'm
crazy
about
her.
You're
right,
I
didn't.
I'm
going
to
get
some
rest.
I'm
going
to
stay
up
for
a
while.
What
was
that
thing?
I
don't
know.
Whatever
it
is,
somebody
has
to
stop
it.
Somebody
there?
Somebody?
Who
said
that?
You've
known
all
along!
Where
are
you?
Follow
the
cold
shiver
running
down
your
spine.
I'm
right
here!
I
don't
understand.
Did
you
think
it
was
coincidence.
So
many
good
things
all
happening
for
you.
All
for
you
Norman.
What
do
you
want?
To
say
what
you
won't.
To
do
what
you
can't.
The
board
members.
You
killed
them?
We
killed
them.
Remember?
Your
little
accident
in
the
laboratory.
Performance
enhancers.
Bingo.
Me!
Your
greatest
creation.
Bringing
you
what
you've
always
wanted.
Power,
beyond
your
wildest
dreams.
And
it's
only
the
beginning.
There's
only
one
who
can
stop
us.
Spiderman.
And
the
Green
Goblin.
Green
Goblin.
Like
that?
Made
it
up
myself.
Hoffman,
call
the
patent
office,
copyright
the
name
Green
Goblin,
I
want
a
quarter
every
time
somebody
says
it.
Spiderman
wasn't
attacking
the
city
he
was
trying
to
save
it.
That's
slander.
It
is
not!
I
resent
that.
Slander
is
spoken.
In
print
it's
libel.
You
don't
trust
anybody,
that's
your
problem.
I
trust
my
barber.
What
are
you
his
lawyer?
Get
out
of
here!
Let
him
sue
me,
get
rich
like
a
normal
person.
That's
what
made
this
country--
Jameson,
you
slime!
Who's
the
photographer
who
takes
the
pictures
of
Spiderman?
I
don't
know
who
he
is.

His
stuff
comes
in
the
mail.
-You're
lying!
He's
the
one
who
can
bring
me
to
him.
I
don't
know
who
he
is.
-You
are
useless
you...
-Speak
of
the
devil.
Hey
kiddo.
Let
mom
and
dad
talk
for
a
minute
will
you?
Sleep!
Wake
up
little
spider.

Wake
up.
No,
you're
not
dead,
yet.

Just
paralyzed,
temporarily.
You're
an
amazing
creature
Spiderman.
You
and
I
are
not
so
different.
I'm
not
like
you.

You're
a
murderer.
Well,
to
each
his
own.
I
chose
my
path,
you
chose
the
way
of
the
hero.
And
they
found
you
amusing
for
a
while.

The
people
of
this
city.
But
the
one
thing
they
love
more
than
a
hero
is
to
see
a
hero
fail.
Fall.
Die
trying.
In
spite
of
everything
you've
done
for
them,
eventually
they
will
hate
you.
Why
bother?
Because,
it's
right.
Here's
the
real
truth.

There
are
8
million
people
in
this
city
and
those
teeming
masses
exist
for
the
sole
purpose
You
and
me,
we're
exceptional.
I
could
squash
Join
me.
Imagine
what
we
could
accomplish
together,
what
we
could
create.
Or
we
could
destroy.
Cause
the
deaths
of
countless
innocents
in
selfish
battle
again
and
again
and
again
until
we're
both
dead!
Is
that
what
you
want?
Think
about
it
hero!
In
spite
of
everything
you've
done
for
them,
eventually
they
will
hate
you.
Hey,
it's
me
again.
Hey.
How
was
your
audition?
How'd
you
know.
The
hotline.

Your
Mom,
told
my
Aunt,
told
me.
So
you
just
came
by?
I
was
in
the
neighbourhood,
needed
to
see
a
friendly
face.
I
took
two
buses
and
a
cab
to
get
in
the
neighbourhood
but
...
So
how'd
it
go?
They
said
I
needed
acting
lessons.
A
soap
opera
told
me
I
needed
acting
lessons.
Let
me
buy
you
a
cheese
burger.
The
sky's
the
limit
up
to
seven
dollars
and
eighty
for
cents.
I'd
like
a
cheese
burger,
oh
but
I'm
going
out
to
dinner
with
Harry.
Come
with
us.
How's
it
going
with--
Ah
nevermind.
It's
none
of
my
business.
It's
not?
Why
so
interested?
I'm
not.
You're
not?
Well,
why
would
I
be?
I
don't
know.
Why
would
you
be?
I
don't
know.
Sorry
you
won't
come
with
us.
I
better
run
tiger.
Hey
check
it
out
man..
Hey
where
you
going
baby,
come
on.
Get
off
me!
Wait.
You
have
a
knack
for
getting
in
trouble.
You
have
a
knack
for
saving
my
life.
I
think
I
have
a
superhero
stalker.
I
was
in
the
neighbourhood.
You
are
amazing.
Some
people
don't
think
so.
But
you
are.
It's
nice
to
have
a
fan.
Do
I
get
to
say
thank
you
this
time?
Wait...
I
have
to
get
in
there!
My
baby's
in
there!
My
baby's
in
there!
-Let
me
go!
My
baby!
Look,
up
there!
Save
my
baby
please!
No!
It's
ok,
your
baby's
fine.
Oh
my
baby!
Bless
you
Spiderman!
Bless
you.
There
he
is,
don't
let
him
get
away!
Hold
it
right
there!
You're
under
arrest,
I'm
taking
you
in.
Oh
my
God,
there's
somebody
still
up
there.
I'm
going.
I'll
be
here
when
you
get
back.
Not
coming
back
chief.
Go!
Go!
Where
are
you?!
I'm
going
to
get
you
out
of
here!
It's
ok!
You're
pathetically
predictable,
like
a
moth
to
the
flame.
What
about
my
generous
proposal?
Are
you
in
or
are
you
out?
It's
you
who's
out
Gobby.
Out
of
your
mind.
Wrong
answer!
Oh
great.
No
one
says
no
to
me!
MJ
would
you
stop
goofing
around?
Harry
relax!
He's
here.
Are
you
ready?
Yeah.
Ah,
Aunt
May,
I'm
sorry
I'm
late.
Work
was
murder.
I
picked
up
a
fruit
cake.
Why
thank
you
Mr.
Osbourne,
we're
so
glad
you
could
come.
-You
look
great.
Who's
this
lovely
new
lady?
MJ
I'd
like
you
to
meet
my
father,
Norman
Osbourne.
Dad,
this
is
Mary
Jane
Watson.
Hi.
How
do
you
do?
I've
been
looking
forward
to
meeting
you.
Happy
Thanksgiving
sir.
Now
where
is
Peter.
He'd
better
have
remembered
that
cranberry
sauce.
Oh,
that's
weird,
I
didn't
know
he
was
here.
Peter?
Peter?
Is
that
you?
Pete?
How
strange.
There's
nobody
here.
Bit
of
a
slob
isn't
he?
All
brilliant
men
are.
Hey
everyone!
Peter!
Sorry
I'm
late.
It's
a
jungle
out
there,
I
had
to
beat
an
old
lady
with
a
stick
to
get
these
cranberries.
Thank
you.
Now
then
everybody
sit
down
and
we
can
say
grace.
It
all
looks
delicious.
Norman!
Will
you
do
the
honours?
Why
Peter,
you're
bleeding.
Oh,
yeah,
I
stepped
off
a
curb
and
got
clipped
by
one
of
those
bike
messengers.
Let
me
see.
Oh
my
goodness.
Oh
that
looks
awful.
-It's
nothing.
Then
we'll
say
grace.
This
is
the
boys'
first
Thanksgiving
in
this
apartment
and
we
are
going
to
do
things
properly.
How
did
you
say
that
happened.
Bike
messenger.
Knocked
me
down.
If
you'll
excuse
me,
I've
got
to
be
going.
Why?
Something
has
come
to
my
attention.
Are
you
all
right?
I'm
fine,
just
fine.
Thank
you
Mrs.
Parker,
everyone,
enjoy
the
fruitcake.
Dad!
Dad,
what
are
you
doing?
I
plan
this
whole
thing
so
you
can
meet
MJ
and
now
you've
got
to
leave?
I've
got
to
go.
Dad,
this
girl
is
important
to
me.
Harry,
please.
Look
at
her.
Do
you
think
a
woman
like
that
is
sniffing
around
because
she
likes
your
personality?
Your
mother
was
beautiful
too,
they're
all
beautiful,
until
they're
snarling
after
your
trust
fund
like
a
pack
of
ravening
wolves.
You're
wrong
about
her
Dad.
A
word
to
the
not
so
wise
about
your
little
girlfriend,
do
what
you
need
to
with
her,
then
broom
her
fast.
Thanks
for
sticking
up
for
me
Harry.
You
heard?
Everyone
heard
that
creep!
That
creep
is
my
father.
If
I'm
lucky
I'll
become
half
of
what
he
is
so
just
keep
your
mouth
shut
about
stuff
you
don't
understand.
Harry
Osbourne!
I'm
sorry
Aunt
May.
Spiderman
is
all
but
invincible
but
Parker
--
we
can
destroy
him.
I
can't.
Betrayal
must
not
be
countenanced!
Parker
must
be
educated.
What
do
I
do.
Instruct
him
in
the
matters
of
loss
and
pain.
Make
him
suffer.
Make
him
wish
that
he
were
dead.
-Yes.
But
how?
The
cunning
warrior
attacks
neither
body
nor
mind.
Tell
me
how!
The
heart
Osbourne!
First
we
attack
his
heart!
Give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread.
And
forgive
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
those
who
tresspass
against
us.
Lead
us
not
into
temptation
but
deliver
us
--
Deliver
us!
Finish
it!
Finish
it!
..Evil!
Aunt
May!
Is
she
going
to
be
ok?
What
happened?
Yes
she's
going
to
be
ok.
Look
you're
going
to
have
to
leave
right
now.
Those
eyes,
those
horrible
yellow
eyes.
He
knows
who
I
am.
I'm
sorry.
Will
she
be
ok?
She's
going
to
be
fine.
She's
been
sleeping
all
day.
Thanks
for
coming.
Of
course.
How
are
you?
You
ok
about
the
other
night?
I
just
feel
bad
about
leaving
Aunt
May.
Have
you
talked
to
Harry?
He
called
me.
I
haven't
called
him
back.
The
fact
is,
I'm
in
love
with
somebody
else.
You
are?
At
least,
I
think
I
am.
It's
not
the
right
time
to
talk
about
it.
No,
no,
go
on.
Would
I
know
his
name,
this
guy?
You'll
think
I'm
a
stupid
little
girl
with
a
crush.
Trust
me.
It's
funny.
He
saved
my
life
twice
and
I've
never
even
seen
his
face.
Oh
him.
You're
laughing
at
me.
No,
no
I
understand.
He
is
extremely
cool.
But
do
you
think
it's
true
all
the
terrible
things
they
say
about
him?
No,
no,
not
Spiderman,
not
a
chance
in
the
world.
I
know
him
a
little
bit,
I'm
sort
of
his
unofficial
photographer.
Has
he
mentioned
me.
Yeah.
What'd
he
say?
I
said...
he
he
asked
me
what
I
thought
about
you.
And
what
did
you
say?
I
said...
uh,
Spiderman,
I
said,
the
great
thing
about
MJ
is
that
when
you
look
in
her
eyes
and
she's
looking
back
in
yours
everything
feels
not
quite
normal
because
you
feel
stronger
and
weaker
at
the
same
time
you
feel
excited
and
at
the
same
time
terrified.
The
truth
is,
you
don't
know
what
you
feel,
except
to
know
the
kind
of
man
you
want
to
be.
It's
as
if
you've
reached
the
unreachable...
And
you
weren't
ready
for
it.
You
said
that?
Well,
something
like
that.
Hey.
Dad?
Dad
is
that
you?
What
is
it?
Well,
you
were
right
about
MJ.
You
were
right
about
everything.
She's
in
love
with
Peter.
Parker.
And
how
does
he
feel
about
her.
Well,
he's
loved
her
since
the
fourth
grade.
He
pretends
like
he
doesn't
but
there's
no
one
Peter
cares
for
more.
I'm
so
sorry.
I
haven't
always
been
there
for
you
have
I?
You're
busy.
You're
an
important
man,
I
understand.
That's
no
excuse.
I'm
proud
of
you.
And
I've
lost
sight
of
that
somewhere
but
I'm
going
to
make
it
up
to
you
Harry.
I'm
going
to
rectify
certain
inequities.
Wake
up
little
spider.
Wake
up.
Go
home
dear.
You
look
awful.
You
look
beautiful.
I
don't
like
to
leave
you
here.
Oh
but
I'm
safe
here.
Can
I
do
anything
for
you?
You
do
too
much.
College,
a
job,
all
this
time
with
me.
You're
not
Superman
you
know.
A
smile.
Finally,
I
haven't
seen
one
of
those
on
your
face
since
Mary
Jane
was
here.
Hey,
you
were
supposed
to
be
asleep.
You
know,
you
were
about
six
years
old
when
MJ's
family
moved
in
next
door.
And
when
she
got
out
of
the
car
and
you
saw
her
for
the
first
time
you
grabbed
me
and
said,
"Aunt
May,
Aunt
May
is
that
an
angel?"
Did
I
say
that?
You
sure
did.
Well,
Harry's
in
love
with
her.

She's
still
his
girl.
Isn't
that
up
to
her?
She
doesn't
really
know
who
I
am.
Because
you
won't
let
her.

You're
so
mysterious
all
the
time.
Tell
me,
would
it
be
so
dangerous
to
let
Mary
Jane
know
how
much
you
care?
Everybody
else
knows.
I'll
be
right
back.
Oh
come
on
pick
up.
Hi
it's
me
sing
your
song
at
the
beep.

Hi
MJ,
it's
Peter.
Are
you
there.
Well,
I'm
just
calling
to
check
up
on
you.
Will
you
call
me
when
you
get
in
ok?
Alright,
well
...
don't,
don't
go
up
any
dark
alleys.
Hello?
Ha
ha
ha
ha
ha.
Can
Spiderman
come
out
to
play?
Where
is
she?
Itsy
bitsy
Spider
went
up
the
water
spout,
down
came
the
Goblin
and
took
the
Spider
out.
Ha
ha
ha
ha...
Goblin,
what
have
you
done?
Spiderman!
This
is
why
only
fools
are
heroes.
Because
you
never
know
when
some
lunatic
will
come
along
with
a
sadistic
choice.
Let
die
the
woman
you
love,
or
..
suffer
the
little
children.
Make
your
choice
Spiderman!
And
see
how
a
hero
is
rewarded.
Don't
do
it
Goblin!
We
are
who
we
choose
to
be.
Everyone
stay
still.
Aghh...
Ahoy
up
there!
We're
going
to
bring
the
barge
right
under
you.
Aiiee,
he's
coming
back!
Listen,
I
need
you
to
climb
down.
-I
can't!
MJ,
you
can
do
it.

You
have
to.
Trust
me.
Hold
on
tight.
Go
quickly.
Hurry!
I
can't
I
can't
do
it.
Hang
on
Mary
Jane!
-He's
not
gonna
make
it.
It's
time
to
die!
Come
on
up
here
dumb
guy
I
got
a
little
something
for
ya.
Leave
Spiderman
alone.

You
gonna
pick
on
a
guy
trying
to
save
a
bunch
of
kids?
You
mess
with
Spidey
you
mess
with
New
York.
You
mess
with
one
of
us
you
mess
with
all
of
us.
Spiderman
watch
out!
Misery.
Misery.
Misery.
That's
what
you've
chosen.
I
offered
you
friendship
and
you
spat
in
my
face.
You've
spun
your
last
web
Spiderman.
Had
you
not
been
so
selfish,
your
little
but
now
you've
really
pissed
me
off
I'm
going
to
finish
her
nice
and
slow.
MJ
and
I
we're
going
to
have
a
hell
of
a
time!
Peter!
Stop!
Stop..
It's
me.
Mr.
Osbourne.
Peter,
thank
God
for
you.
You
killed
those
people
on
that
balcony.
The
Goblin
killed
them,
I
had
nothing
to
do
with
it!
Don't,
don't
let
him
take
me
again!
Help
me.
Protect
me!
You
tried
to
kill
Aunt
May.
You
tried
to
kill
Mary
Jane.
But
not
you.
I
tried
to
stop
it.
I
couldn't
stop
it.
I
would
never
hurt
you.
I
knew
from
the
beginning,
if
anything
ever
happened
to
me
It
was
you
that
I
could
count
on
you
Peter
Parker
would
save
me
and
so
you
have.
Thank
God
for
you.
Give
me
your
hand.
Believe
in
me.
As
I
believed
in
you.
I've
been
like
a
father
to
you.
Be
a
son
to
me
now.
I
have
a
father.
His
name
was
Ben
Parker.
Godspeed
Spiderman.
Oh.
Don't
tell
Harry.
What
have
you
done?
What
have
you
done?!
Hey.
I'm
so
sorry
man.
I
know
what
it's
like
to
lose
a
father.
I
didn't
lose
him.
He
was
stolen
from
me.
One
day
Spiderman
will
pay.
I
swear
on
my
father's
grave,
Spiderman
will
pay.
Thank
God
for
you
Peter,
you're
the
only
family
I
have.
No
matter
what
I
do,
no
matter
how
hard
I
try,
the
ones
I
love,
will
always
be
the
ones
who
pay.
You
must
miss
him
so
much.
It's
been
so
hard
without
him.
There's
something
I've
been
wanting
to
tell
you.
When
I
was
up
there,
and
I
thought
I
was
going
to
die,
there's
only
one
person
who
I
was
thinking
of.
And
it
wasn't
who
I
thought
it'd
be.
It
was
you
Pete.
I
kept
thinking,
"I
hope
I
make
it
through
this,
so
I
could
see
Peter
Parker's
face
one
more
time."
Really?
There's
only
one
man
who's
always
been
there
for
me.
Who
makes
me
feel
like
I'm
more
than
I
ever
thought
I
could
be.
That
I'm
just,
me,
and
that's
ok.
The
truth
is
...
I
love
you.
I
love
you
so
much
Peter.
All
I
wanted
was
to
tell
her
how
much
I
loved
her...
I
can't.
You
can't
what?
Tell
you,
everything
I
mean.
There's
so
much
to
tell.
Yeah,
there's
so
much
to
tell.
I
want
you
to
know
that
I
will
always
be
there
for
you.
I
will
always
be
there
to
take
care
of
you.
I
promise
you
that.
I
will
always
be
your
friend.
Only
a
friend,
Peter
Parker?
That's
all
I
have
to
give.
Whatever
life
holds
in
store
for
me,
I
will
never
forget
these
words,
'With
great
power
comes
great
responsibility.'
This
is
my
gift,
my
curse.
Who
am
I?
I'm
Spiderman.
