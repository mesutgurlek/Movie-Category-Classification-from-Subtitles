Hello?
I
wondered
when
I'd
be
seeing
you,
Mr.
It
seems
only
yesterday...
...that
your
mother
and
father
were
in
here
buying
their
first
wands.
Here
we
are.
Give
it
a

Apparently
not.
Perhaps...
...this.
No,
no,
definitely
not.
No
matter.
I
wonder....
Curious.
Very
curious.
Sorry,
but
what's
curious?
I
remember
every
wand
I've
ever
sold,
It
so
happens
that
the
phoenix...
...whose
tail
feather
resides
in
your
wand,
gave
another
feather.
Just
one
other.

is
curious
that
you
should
be

brother
gave
you
that

who
owned
that
wand?

do
not
speak
his
name.

wand

I
think
it
is
clear...
...that
we
can
expect
great
things
After
all,
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...
...did
great
things.
Terrible...
...yes,

I
know
you
do.
First,
and
understand
this
because
Not
all
wizards
are
good.
Some
of
them
go
bad.
A
few
years
...there
was
a
wizard
who
went
as
bad
as
you
can
go.
His
name
was

His
name
was

No,

one.
Except
you.
Me?
Voldemort
tried
to
kill
me?
Yes.
That
ain't
no
ordinary
cut
on
A
mark
like
that
only
comes
from
being
touched
by
a
curse,
an
evil
curse.
What
happened
to
V--?
To
You-Know-Who?
Well,
some
say
he
died.
Codswallop,
in
my
opinion.
Nope,
I
reckon
he's
out
there
still...
...too
tired
to
carry
on.
But
one
thing's
certain.
Something
about
you
stumped
him
that
night.
That's
why
you're
famous.
That's
why
everybody
knows
your
name.
You're
the
boy
who
lived.
What
are
you
looking
at?
Blimey,
is
that
the
time?

Baron!
Hello,
Sir
Nicholas.
Have
a
nice
Dismal.
Once
again,
my
request
to
join
the
Headless
Hunt
has
been
denied.
I
know
you.
You're
Nearly
Headless
I
prefer
Sir
Nicholas,
if
you
don't
"Nearly"
headless?
How
can
you
be
Like
this.
Gryffindors,
follow
me,
please.
Keep
Ravenclaw,
follow
me.
This
way.
This
is
the
most
direct
path
to
the
Keep
an
eye
on
the
staircases.
They
Keep
up,
please,
and
follow
me.
Quickly
now,
come
on.
Come
on.
That
picture's
moving.
-
Look
at
that
one.
-
Look!
Welcome
to
Hogwarts.
Password?
Caput
Draconis.
Follow
me,
everyone.
Keep
up.
Quickly,
Gather
around
here.
Welcome
to
the
Gryffindor
common
room.
Boys'dormitory
is
upstairs
to
the
left.
Girls,
the
same
on
your
right.
Your
belongings
have
already
been
Made
it!
Can
you
imagine
the
look
on
old
McGonagall's
face
if
we
were
late?
-
That
was
bloody
brilliant!
It'd
be
better
if
I
transfigured
Mr.
Potter
and
you
into
a
watch.
-
Then
one
of
you
might
be
on
time.
Then
perhaps
a
map?
I
trust
you
don't
need
one
to
find
your
seats.
There
will
be
no
foolish
wand-waving
or
silly
incantations
in
this
class.
As
such,
I
don't
expect
many
of
you
to
...the
subtle
science
and
exact
art
However,
for
those
select
few...
...who
possess
the
predisposition...
...I
can
teach
you
how
to
bewitch
the
...and
ensnare
the
senses.
I
can
tell
you
how
to
bottle
fame...
...brew
glory
and
even
put
a
stopper
Then
again,
maybe
some
of
you
have
come
to
Hogwarts
in
possession
of
...so
formidable
that
you
feel
...to
not
pay
attention.
Mr.
Potter.
Our
new
celebrity.
What
would
I
get
if
I
added
root
of
asphodel
to
an
infusion
of
wormwood?
You
don't
know?
Let's
try
again.
Where
would
you
look
if
I
asked
you
to
I
don't
know,
sir.
What
is
the
difference
between
I
don't
know,
sir.
Pity.
Clearly,
fame
isn't
everything...
...is
it,
Mr.
Potter?

Can
I
borrow
this?
Thanks.
Look,
Neville's
got
a
Remembrall.
I've
read
about
those.
The
smoke
turns
red
when
you've
forgotten
something.
The
problem
is,
I
can't
remember
what
Somebody
broke
into
Gringotts.
Listen.
"Believed
to
be
the
work
of
Dark
...Gringotts
goblins
acknowledge
the
breach
but
insist
nothing
was
taken.
The
vault
in
question,
number
713,
had
been
emptied
earlier
that
same
day."
That's
odd.
That's
the
vault
Hagrid

Good
afternoon,
class.
Good
afternoon,
Amanda.
Good
Welcome
to
your
first
flying
lesson.
What
are
you
waiting
for?
Step
up
to
Come
on
now,
hurry
up.
Stick
your
hand
over
the
broom
and
say,
"Up."
Up!
Up.
Up.
Up.
Up!
With
feeling.
Shut
up,
Harry.
Now,
once
you've
got
hold
of
your
broom,
I
want
you
to
mount
it.
Grip
it
tight.
You
don't
wanna

When
I
blow
my
whistle,
I
want
you
to

for

lean
forward
slightly

Mr.
Longbottom.
-
Mr.
Longbottom!
Neville!
Come
back
down
this
instant!
Everyone
out
of
the
way!
Is
he
all
right?
Oh,
dear,
it's
a
broken
wrist.
Poor
boy.
Come
on
now,
up
you
get.
Keep
your
feet
on
the
ground
while
I
take
him
to
the
hospital
wing.
Understand?
If
I
see
a
single
broom
in
...the
one
riding
it
will
be
expelled
before
they
can
say
Quidditch.
Did
you
see
his
face?
If
he
had
squeezed
this,
he'd
have
remembered
to
fall
on
his
arse.
Give
it
here,
Malfoy.
No.
I'll
leave
it
somewhere
for

about
on
the
roof?
What's
the
matter,
Potter?
Bit
beyond
Harry,
no
way!
You
heard
what

Besides,
you
don't
know
how
to

What
an
idiot.
Give
it
here
or
I'll
knock
you
off
Is
that
so?
Have
it
your
way,
then.
-
Nice
going,
Harry.
Harry
Potter!
Follow
me.
You
wait
here.
Professor
Quirrell,
excuse
me.
Could
I
borrow
Wood
for
a
moment?
Yes,
of
course.
Potter,
this
is

A
century,

says.
Well
done,
Harry.

told
us.
Fred

Go
on.
Quidditch

there
is,

you'll
be
great
too.
I've
never

I'm
telling
you,
it's
spooky.
She
knows
more
about
you
than
you
do.
Who
doesn't?
What's
happening?
The
staircases
change,
remember?
-
Let's
go
this
way.
Does
anybody
feel
like
we
shouldn't

We're
not
supposed
to

This
is

It's

go.

It's

Quick,
let's
hide

-
It's
locked!

over!
Alohomora.
Get

Anyone
here,
my
sweet?
Come
on.
-
Filch
is
gone.
-
It
was
locked.
What
are
they
doing,
keeping
a
thing
like
that
locked
up
in
a
school?
Didn't
you
see
what
it
was
standing
I
wasn't
looking
at
its
feet!
I
was
preoccupied
with
its
heads.
Or
maybe
you
didn't
notice.
There
were
It
was
standing
on

door.

It's

something.
That's
right.

worse,

needs
to
sort
out

priorities.

Chasers,

Beaters,
one
Keeper
and
a
Seeker.
That's
you.
There
are
three
kinds
of
balls.
This
one's
called
the
Quaffle.
The
Chasers
handle
the
Quaffle
and
try
to
put
it
through
one
of
those
hoops.
The
Keeper,
that's
me,
defends
the
I
think
so.
What
are
those?
You
better
take
this.
Careful
now,
it's
coming
back.
Not
bad,
Potter.
You'd
make
a
fair
What
was
that?
Bludger.
Nasty
little
buggers.
But
you
are
a
Seeker.
The
only
thing
I
want
you
to
worry
The
Golden
Snitch.
-
I
like
this
ball.
Just
wait.
It's
wicked
fast
and
damn
What
do
I
do
with
it?
You
catch
it.
Before
the
other
team's
You
catch
this,
the
game's
over.
You
catch
this,
Potter,
and
we
win.
One
of
a
wizard's
most
rudimentary
...or
the
ability
to
make
objects
fly.
Do
you
have
your
feathers?
Good.
Now,
don't
forget
the
nice
wrist
movement
we've
been
practicing.
The
swish
and
flick.
Everyone.
The
swish
and
flick.
Good.
Oh,
and
Wingardium
Leviosa.
Off
you
go,
then.
Wingardium

Wingardium
Leviosa.
No,
stop,
stop,
stop!
You're
going

Besides,
you're
saying
it
wrong.
It's
You
do
it
then,
if
you're
so
clever.
Wingardium
Leviosa.
Well
done!
See
here,
everyone,
Miss
Splendid!
Well
done,
dear.
I
think
we're
going
to
need
another
"It's
Leviosa,
not
Leviosar."
She's
a
nightmare,
honestly!
No
wonder
she
hasn't
got
any
friends.
I
think
she
heard
you.
Where's
Hermione?
Parvati
said
she
wouldn't
come
out
of
She
said
that
she'd
been

Troll
in
the
dungeon!
Troll
in
the
dungeon!
Thought
you
ought
to
know.
Silence!
Everyone
will
please
not
panic!
Now...
...prefects
will
lead
their
house
back
Teachers
will
follow
me
to
the
Gryffindors,
keep
up,
please,
and
stay
How
could
a
troll
get
in?
Not
on
its
own.
Trolls
are
really
stupid.
Probably
people
playing
jokes.
-
What?
I
think
the
troll's
left
the
dungeon.
It's
going
into
the
girls'bathroom.
Hermione,
move!
