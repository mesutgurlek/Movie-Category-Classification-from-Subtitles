M
really
doesn't
mind
you
earning
a
little
money
on
the
side,
Dryden.
She'd
just
prefer
it
if
it
wasn't
selling
secrets.
If
the
theatrics
are
supposed
to
scare
me
you
have
the
wrong
man,
Bond.
If
M
was
so
sure
that
I
was
bent
she'd
have
sent
a
double-0.
Benefits
of
being
section
chief...
...l'd
know
if
anyone
had
been
promoted
to
double-0
status
wouldn't
I?
-
Your
file
shows
no
kills,
and
it
takes-
-
Shame.
I
know
where
you
keep
your
gun.
-
True.
How
did
he
die?
Not
well.
Made
you
feel
it,
did
he?
Well,
you
needn't
worry.
The
second
is-
-
Yes.
Considerably.
So
how
do
I
trust
this
man
that
I've
never
met
with
my
money?
You
asked
for
the
introduction.
I
suppose
our
friend
Mr.
White
will
have
told
you
...for
many
other
freedom
fighters
over
the
years.
-

Do
you
believe
in
God,
Mr.
Le
Chiffre?
I
believe
in
a
reasonable
rate
of
return.
Agreed.
-
And
I
can
access
it
anywhere
in
the
world?
I
have
the
money,
so
short
another
million
shares
of
Skyfleet
stock.
Sir,
you
must
know
you're
betting
against
the
market.
No
one
expects
this
stock
to
go
anywhere
but
up.
Just
do
it.
Looks
like
our
man.
I
wonder
if
bomb-makers
are
insured
for
things
like
that.
He's
on
the
move.
Stop
touching
your
ear.
-
Sorry?
Holster
the
bloody
weapon,
Carter.
Weeping
blood
comes
merely
Nothing
sinister.
All
in.
I
have
two
pair,
When
does
Ellipsis
expire?
-
We
have
less
than
36
hours.
I
can--
That's
all
the
time
I
have
anyway.
Give
our
guests
five
minutes
to
leave
or
throw
them
overboard.
Who
the
hell
do
they
think
they
are?
I
report
to
the
prime
minister,
Have
you
ever
seen
such
a
bunch
of
self-righteous,
arse-covering
prigs?
They
don't
care
what
we
do,
they
care
what
we
get
photographed
doing.
And
how
the
hell
could
Bond
be
so
stupid?
I
give
him
double-O
status
and
he
celebrates
by
shooting
up
an
embassy!
Is
the
man
deranged?
In
the
old
days,
if
an
agent
did
something
Christ,
I
miss
the
Cold
War.
-
You've
got
a
bloody
cheek.
I'll
shoot
the
camera
first
next
time.
You
stormed
into
an
embassy.
You
violated
the
only
And
why?
So
you
could
kill
a
nobody.
For
God's
sake.
I
did.
Exactly.
One
bomb-maker.
We're
trying
to
find
out
how
an
entire
...and
you
give
us
one
bomb-maker
hardly
the
big
picture,
The
man
isn't
even
a
true
believer.
And
thanks
to
your
over
developed
trigger
finger,
-
And
how
the
hell
did
you
find
out
where
I
lived?
I
thought
M
was
a
randomly
assigned
letter.
Utter
one
more
syllable
and
I'll
have
you
killed.
I
knew
it
was
too
early
to
promote
you.
Well,
I
understand
double-0s
have
a
very
short
life-expectancy...
...so
your
mistake
will
be
short-lived.
Bond,
this
may
be
too
much
for
a
blunt
instrument
to
understand...
...but
arrogance
and
self-awareness
seldom
go
hand
in
hand.
-
So
you
want
me
to
be
half
monk,
half
hit-man?
I
want
you
to
take
your
ego
out
of
the
equation
I
have
to
know
I
can
trust
you,
and
that
you
know
who
to
trust.
And
since
I
don't
know
that,
I
need
you
out
of
my
sight.
Go
and
stick
your
head
in
the
sand
Because
these
bastards
want
your
head.
And
I'm
seriously
considering
feeding
you
to
them.
And
Bond...
...don't
ever
break
into
my
house
again.
Ma'am.
Good
day,
sir,
and
welcome
to
the
Ocean
Club.
Hey.
Hey.
Hello.
Are
you
going
to
take
this
or
make
me
wait?
Certainly,
sir.
Sorry,
sir.
-
Security
to

park.
Security
to
car
park.
Welcome
to
the
Ocean
Club,
sir.
Yes.
Okay.
-
We
have
an
ocean-view
villa.
Could
you
do
me
a
favor?
...and
I
parked
my
car
next
to
a
very
beautiful
1964
Aston
Martin.
And
I'm
ashamed
to
say
I
nicked
the
door.
-
Mr.
Dimitrios.
If
he
hasn't
noticed,
I'm
not
sure
I'd
mention
it.
But
if
I
felt
compelled
to
find
him?
-
He
has
a
house
just
up
the
beach.
-
What?
You
woke
me
to
share
his
holiday
plans?
Well,
he's
logged
into
our
secure
website
using
your
name
and
password.
-
Well,
how
the
hell
does
he
know
these
things?
-
Who's
he
looking
at?
That
slimy
bugger.
Now
known
associates....
Le
Chiffre.
-
We've
had
a
good
night,
we've
had
a
few
drinks.
Good
evening.
-
Look
what
just
happened.
Yeah.
Do
you
mind
if
I
join?
-
Oh,
good
evening.
-
Small
blind,
big
blind.
Bet's
to
you.
If
that
was
for
luck,
you're
two
hours
late.
Two
hundred
to
you.
-
Bet's
to
you.
Five
to
call.
-
Action's
to
you.
-
Ace
high.
-
Check.
Five
thousand.
Five
to
call.
-
Check.
All
in.
No,
wait.
Twenty
thousand.
Table
stakes.
I'm
sorry,
sir.
Okay.
This
is
on
the
table.
I'm
sorry,
Mr.
Dimitrios.
Please,
no.
Give
him
a
chance
to
win
his
money
back.
All
right,
show
me,
gentlemen.
Three
kings.
There
you
go
with
my
night.
Trip
aces.
Aces
win.
Oh,
and
the
valet
ticket.
Thank
you.
Sir.
-
Thank
you.
No
wonder
he
was
in
such
a
foul
mood.
My
mistake.
Can
I
give
you
a
lift
home?
That
would
really
send
him
over
the
edge.
Well,
perhaps
you're
just
out
of
practice.
Perhaps.
Well,
what
about
a
drink
at
my
place?
Your
place?
-
Is
it
close?
One
drink.
-
Good
evening,
sir,
and
welcome
back.
I'm
having
a
hard
time
seeing
how
this
is
my
fault.
It's
your
plan.
A
man
who
was
under
surveillance
by
the
British
Secret
Service.
Which
makes
me
wonder
if
I
can
trust
you
at
all.
Then
don't.
I
couldn't
care
less.
But
I
do
care
about
my
reputation.
I
have
someone
else
willing
to
do
the
job.
He
just
needs
the
particulars
and
payment.
You
like
married
women,
don't
you,
James?
It
keeps
things
simple.
What
is
it
about
bad
men?
You,
my
husband
I
had
so
many
chances
to
be
happy...
...so
many
nice
guys.
Why
can't
nice
guys
be
more
like
you?
Well,
because
then
they'd
be
bad.
Yes.
But
so
much
more
interesting.
What
makes
your
husband
a
bad
man?
His
nature,
I
suppose.
The
nature
of
his
work?
A
mystery,
I'm
afraid.
I'm
also
afraid
you
will
sleep
with
me
in
order
to
get
to
him.
How
afraid?
Not
enough
to
stop.
Can
I
ask
you
a
personal
question?
Now
would
seem
an
appropriate
time.
Does
"ellipsis"
mean
anything
to
you?
Should
I
ask
him
about
it?
Perhaps
later.
Yes,
dear?
I'm
on
the
last
flight
tonight
to
Miami.
Don't
wait
up.
Okay,
I
understand.
See
you
tomorrow.
Bye-bye.
Apparently
he's
on
the
last
flight
to
Miami...
...so
you
have
all
night
to
question
me.
In
that
case
we're
gonna
need
some
more
champagne.
Good
evening.
Room
Service.
Good
evening.
-
With
everything?
-
And
would
that
be
for
two,
sir?
-
For
two?
Wait
here.
There
you
go.

Yes.
I'm

Listen,
you
go

find

I
think
a

is
about
to
go
off,
and
you
do
it
now.
-
Sorry,
can
I
put
you
on
hold?
Bond?
What
the
hell
are
you
up
to?
I'll
call
you
back.

I'm
gonna
get
a

more

Quite
the

you're
stacking
up.
She
was
tortured
first.
As
you'd
already
killed
her
husband
Did
she
know
anything
that
could
compromise
you?
No.
-
Not
your
name,
what
you
were
after?
Dimitrios
worked
as
a
middleman.
Always
knew
where
to
He
worked
with
anyone
who
had
money.
For
years
he
was
involved
with
a
man
we
knew
as
He
invested
their
money
and
gave
them
access
to
it
wherever
they
wanted.
Oh,
good.
You're
here.
Albanian,
we
believe.
A
bit
of
a
mathematical
genius
and
liked
to
prove
it
by
playing
poker.
So
you
can
keep
an
eye
on
me?
Yes.
When
they
analyzed
the
stock
market
after
9/11...
...the
CIA
discovered
a
massive
shorting
of
airline
stocks.
When
the
stocks
hit
bottom
on
9/12,
somebody
made
a
fortune.
The
same
thing
happened
this
morning
with
Skyfleet
stock
or
was
supposed
to.
With
their
prototype
destroyed,
the
company
would
be
near
bankruptcy.
Instead,
somebody
lost
over
$100
million
betting
the
wrong
way.
You
think
it's
this
man
Le
Chiffre.
Which
would
explain
how
he
could
set
up
a
Ten
players,
$10
million
buy-in,
5
million
re-buy.
Winner
takes
all.
Good.
Do
you
want
a
clean
kill,
or
do
you
want
to
send
a
message?
We
want
him
alive.
Has
he
been
playing
the
stock
market
with
his
clients'
funds?
They're
not
gonna
be
too
happy
when
they
find
out
it's
gone.
We
can't
let
him
win
this
game.
We'll
give
him
sanctuary
in
return
for
everything
he
knows.
I'm
putting
you
in
the
game
replacing
someone
who's
playing
for
a
syndicate.
According
to
Villiers,
you're
the
best
player
in
the
Service.
Trust
me,
I
wish
it
wasn't
the
case.
I
would
ask
you
if
you
could
remain
emotionally
detached...
...but
I
don't
think
that's
your
problem,
is
it,
Bond?
No.
Don't
worry
about
keeping
in
touch.
You
can
stop
pretending.
You
knew
I
wouldn't
let
this
drop,
didn't
you?
Well,
I
knew
you
were
you.
Thank
you.
I'm
the
money.
Every
penny
of
it.
The
Treasury
has
agreed
to
stake
you
in
the
game.
"Vesper."
Well,
I
do
hope
you
gave
your
parents
hell
for
that.
Thank
you.
Your
boss
must
be
well-connected.
I've
never
seen
so
much
go
out
the
door
so
quickly.
Or
quite
so
stylishly.
May
I
ask
you
where
it
is?
Ten
million
was
wired
to
your
account
in
Montenegro...
...with
a
contingency
for
5
more
if
I
deem
it
a
prudent
investment.
I
suppose
you've
given
some
thought
to
the
notion
that
if
you
lose...
...our
government
will
have
directly
financed
terrorism.
What
looks
good?
So
you're
telling
me
it's
a
matter
of
probability
and
odds.
I
was
worried
there
was
some
chance
involved.
Well,
only
if
you
assume
the
player
with
the
best
hand
wins.
So
that
would
be
what
you
call
"bluffing"?
You've
heard
the
term.
Then
you'll
also
know
that
in
poker
you
never
play
your
hand.
You
play
the
man
across
from
you.
-
And
you're
good
at
reading
people?
Which
is
why
I've
been
able
to
detect
I'm
now
assured
our
money
is
in
good
hands.
You
don't
think
this
is
a
very
good
plan,
do
you?
So
there
is
a
plan?
I
got
the
impression
we
were
risking
millions
of
dollars
What
else
can
you
surmise,
Mr.
Bond?
About
you,
Miss
Lynd?
Well,
your
beauty's
a
problem.
You
worry
you
won't
be
taken
seriously.
Which
one
can
say
of
any
attractive
woman
with
half
a
brain.
True,
but
this
one
overcompensates
by
wearing
slightly
masculine
clothing...
...being
more
aggressive
than
her
female
colleagues
...and
ironically
enough,
makes
it
less
likely
for
her
to
be
accepted
...who
mistake
her
insecurities
for
arrogance.
Now,
I'd
have
normally
gone
with
only
child
but,...
...you
see,
by
the
way
you
ignored
the
quip
about
All
right.
By
the
cut
of
your
suit,
you
went
to
Oxford
or
wherever
But
you
wear
it
with
such
disdain
my
guess
is
you
didn't
come
from
money...
...and
your
school
friends
never
let
you
forget
it.
Which
means
you
were
at
that
school
by
the
grace
And
since
your
first
thought
about
me
ran
to
orphan
Oh,
you
are.
I
like
this
poker
thing.
And
that
makes
perfect
sense
since
...that
give
little
thought
to
sacrificing
others
You
know
former
SAS
types
with
easy
smiles
and
expensive
watches.
-
Rolex?
Beautiful.
Now,
having
just
met
you
I
wouldn't
go
-
No,
of
course
not.
You
think
of
women
as
disposable
pleasures
rather
than
meaningful
pursuits.
So
as
charming
as
you
are,
Mr.
Bond
...and
off
your
perfectly
formed
arse.
You
noticed?
Even
accountants
have
imagination.
How
was
your
lamb?
Skewered.
One
sympathizes.
Good
evening,
Mr.
Bond.
Good
evening,
Miss
Lynd.

sir?

Thank
you,
sir.
It's
just
last-minute
details.
Apparently
we're
very
much
in
love.
Do
you
usually
leave
it
to
porters
to
tell
you
this
sort
of
thing?
Only
when
the
romance
has
been
necessarily
brief.
I'm
Mr.
Arlington
Beech,

-
I
am
not.
Oh,
no,
I
don't.
We've
been
involved
for
quite
a
while
hence
the
shared
suite.
But
my
family
is

I
do
hate
it
when
religion
comes
between
us.
Religion
and
a
securely
locked
door.
Am
I
going
to
have
a
problem
with
you,
Bond?
No,
don't
worry.
You're
not
my
type.
Smart?
Single.
Welcome
to

You'll

Welcome,
Mr.
Bond.
You
represent
the

Thank
you.
Enjoy
your
stay.
I
will.
Thank
you.
Very
funny.
Look,
if
Le
Chiffre
is
that
well-connected,
Which
means
he's
decided
to
play
me
anyway.
So
he's
either
desperate
or
he's
overly
confident
but
either
way,
And
all
he
gets
in
return
is
a
name
he
already
has.
And
now
he
knows
something
about
you.
Take
the
next
one.
There
isn't
enough
room
for
me
and
your
ego.
Mr.
Bond?
-
It
was
left
for
you.
I
love
you
too,
M.
My
name
is
Mathis.
Rene
Mathis.
Does
he
know
we've
been
watching
him?
Le
Chiffre?
I
don't
think
so.
Probably
because
there's
no
"we."
I'm
afraid
if
you
get
into
trouble
here...
...the
cavalry
won't
be
coming
over
the
nearest
hill.
Le
Chiffre
arrived
yesterday
and
spent
The
chief
of
police
and
he
are
now
quite
close.
That's
him,
with
the
mustache.
Over
my
left
shoulder.
Well,
that
could
make
life
quite
difficult.
Yeah,
and
quite
possibly
shorter.
He's
not
a
very
subtle
man.
I
thought
about
trying
to
buy
his
services,
but
we
frankly...
...couldn't
afford
to
outbid
Le
Chiffre.
I
hate
to
say
it
Oh,
not
that
I
have
anything
against
accountants.
Many
of
them
are
lovely
people.
So
I
decided
that
it
was
cheaper
to
supply
his
deputy...
...with
evidence
that
we
were
bribing
the
chief.
It's
amazing
what
you
can
do
with
Photoshop
these
days,
isn't
it?
I
think
your
odds
are
improving,
Mr.
Bond.
Yes?
For
you.
Something
you
expect
me
to
wear?
I
need
you
looking
fabulous.
So
that
when
you
walk
up
behind
me
and
kiss
me
on
the
neck,
...and
not
about
their
cards.
I'll
do
my
best.
Thank
you.
I
have
a
dinner
jacket.
There
are
dinner
jackets
and
dinner
jackets.
This
is
the
latter.
And
I
need
you
looking
like
a
man
who
belongs
at
that
table.
How--?
It's
tailored.
I
sized
you
up
the
moment
we
met.
-
Good
evening,
sir.
Thank
you.
And
you
must
be
Mr.
Bliss'
replacement.
Welcome,
Mr.
Beech.
Well,
we
wouldn't
want
that,
would
we?
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
welcome.
As
you
know,
the
game
is
no-limit
hold
'em
poker.
Five
communal
cards,
two
in
the
hole.
Monsieur
Mendel
here
represents
the
Basel
Bank,
You
have
each
deposited
$10
million
buy-in.
A
further
buy-in
of
5
million
can
be
made
by
electronic
transfer.
The
money
will
remain
in
escrow
until
I
return
...into
the
encryptor
whereupon
the
entire
sum
will
be
Mr.
Bond?
We
proceed
alphabetically.
Please
be
so
kind
as
to
enter
a

of
your
choice.
Six

more.

It's

Mr.
Kaminofsky
is

...and
Mr.
Fukutu,
the

Well,
enjoy
the

It's

Monsieur
Le
Chiffre.
Bet.
One
hundred
thousand.
Weren't
you
supposed
to
enter
so
the
others
could
see
you?
Was
I?
Forgive
me.
Good
luck,
darling.
It's
up
to
you,
Monsieur
Bond.
Monsieur
Bond?
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
What
was
the
bet?
Call.
Hello.
I
suppose
I
don't
have
to
tell
you
how
beautiful
you
look.
Half
the
people
at
that
table
are
still
watching
you.
Champagne.
Monsieur
Le
Chiffre.
Bet.
Two
hundred
thousand.
Monsieur,
you
have
been
called.
A
full
house
to
Monsieur
Le
Chiffre.
Mr.
Bond?
Fold.
Send
the
barman
over,
please.
-
A
dry
martini.
Wait.
Three
measures
of
Gordon's,
one
of
vodka,
-
...and
then
add
a
thin
slice
of
lemon
peel.
-
You
know,
I'll
have
one
of
those.
Certainly.
My
friend,
bring
me
one
as
well.
That's
it?
-
Anyone
want
to
play
poker
now?
Would
you
excuse
me?
You
taste
nice.
-
I
thought
we
dispensed
with
covers.
We
dispensed
with
one
that
was
of
no
use
and
created
another
that
is.
-
Is
he
watching?
Good.
This
is
me
in
character
pissed
off
because
Oddly,
my
character's
feelings
mirror
my
own.
Check.
-
You
know,
that's
not
half
bad.
I'm
gonna
have
to
think
up
a
name
for
that.
It
was
worth
it
to
discover
his
tell.
What
do
you
mean?
The
twitch
he
has
to
hide
when
he
bluffs.
-
Bluffs?
He
had
the
best
hand.
The
odds
against
were
23-to-1,
and
he'd
know
that.
When
he
did
his
first
raise
he
had
nothing.
Winning
was
blind
luck.
-
Did
you
get
the
bug?
-
Bet.
One
hundred
thousand.
-
It's
your
play,
Monsieur
Fukutu.
Call.
Monsieur
Le
Chiffre.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
Mesdames,
Messieurs
It's
time
for
a
short
break.
Well,
I
think
I'll
report
on
the
evening's
frivolities.
So?
You
want
to
do
what
to
me?
You've
lost
me
completely.
You
just
said
you
can't
wait
to
get
me
back
to
the
room.
Come
on.
So,
what's--?
I'm
sorry.
Where
is
my
money?
-
Good
evening.
You're
holding
a
parcel
for
me.
Thank
you.
Do
you
think
you
can
lose
that
kind
of
money
and
no
one
would
notice?
Your
money
is
safe.
Open
that.
You'll
have
it
tomorrow.
All
of
it.
I
would
take
a
hand
for
this
betrayal,
but
you
need
it
to
play
cards.
Hold
out
your
arm.
Hold
out
your
arm,
my
beauty
or
I
will
take
your
head.
Go
to
the
room.
Wait
for
me
there.
Stairs.
Not
a
word
of
protest.
You
should
find
a
new
boyfriend.
Go
find
Mathis.
Tell
him
I've
hidden
the
bodies
down
here,
Do
that
now.
Go.
Go,
go!
You
changed
your
shirt,
Mr.
Bond.
I
hope
our
little
game
isn't
causing
you
to
perspire.
A
little.
But
I
won't
consider
myself
to
be
in
trouble
until
I
start
weeping
blood.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
if
everybody's
ready,
let's
continue
the
game.
It's
like
there's
blood
on
my
hands.
Here,
let's
see.
That's
better.
You
cold?
Yeah.
Here.
You
have
any
trouble
with
the
bodies?
Less
than
some.
Being
dead
doesn't
mean
one
can't
still
be
helpful.
That'll
keep
Le
Chiffre
looking
over
his
shoulder.
He'll
be
wondering
who's
gonna
come
for
him
next.
How's
our
girl?
Melted
your
cold
heart
yet?
Call.
Fold.
And
call.
Three
players.
Three
hundred
grand.
Bet.
Three
hundred
thousand.
Call.
And
call.
Three
players.
Check.
Monsieur
Bond?
Bet.
Five
hundred
thousand.
Look.
It's
the
tell.
He
is
bluffing.
My
God,
James
was
right.
It's
up
to
you.
Raise.
One
million.
Seems
someone
knows
something
I
don't.
Fold.
Heads
up,
gentlemen.
It's
up
to
you.
Two.
Re-raise.
Two
million.
And
it's
up
to
you.
I'm
all
in.
Well,
it's
14
million
and
500,000.
Bond
will
have
to
go
all
in
to
call
his
bluff.
-
Call.
Gentlemen,
showdown,
please.
Full
house.
Kings
and
aces.
It's
four
jacks.
You
must
have
thought
I
was
bluffing,
Mr.
Bond.
Please.
We
will
now
break
for
one
hour.
Good
game.
Well,
I'm
gonna
need
the
other
5
million
to
buy
back
in.
I
can't
do
that,
James.
Look,
I
made
a
mistake.
I
was
impatient,
maybe
I
was
arrogant,
but
I
can
beat
him.
-
I'm
sorry.
Sorry?
Why
don't
you
try
putting
that
in
a
sentence,
like
maybe,
"Sorry
Le
Chiffre's
gonna
win,
continue
funding
terror
You
lost
because
of
your
ego,
and
that
same
ego
can't
take
it.
-
All
you're
going
to
do
now
is
lose
more.
-
I'm
sorry?
Look
in
my
eyes.
I
can
beat
this
man,
you
know
that.
Get
your
hand
off
my
arm.
Vodka
martini.
-
Shaken
or
stirred?
-
James.
Funny
game,
right?
Felix
Leiter,
a
brother
from
Langley.
You
should
have
a
little
faith.
If
you
keep
your
head
about
you,
I
think
you
have
him.
Had.
Excuse
me.
You're
not
buying
in?
No.
Listen,
I'm
bleeding
chips.
You
have
a
better
chance.
I'm
saying
I'll
give
you
the
money
to
keep
going.
Just
one
thing.
And
what
about
the
winnings?
Does
it
look
like
we
need
the
money?
Shall
we
up
the
blinds?
Why
not?
Bet.
Raise.
And
fold.
Excuse
me,
please.
Call.
Raise.
Raise.
Five
hundred
thousand.
-
Fold.
Fold.
Fold.
Thank
you.
Wins.
Deal
me
out.
Sorry,
sir.
You
are
the
big
blind.
Small
blind,
please.
-
Who
is
it?
Bond's
been
poisoned.
Stay
calm
and
don't
interrupt.
Because
you'll
be
dead
-
I'm
all
ears.
-
Do
we
know
what
it
is
yet?
Attach
the
leads
to
your
chest.
Ventricular
tachycardia.
Digitalis.
What
the
hell
do
we
give
him?
-
As
soon
as
it
reads
charged--
Bond,
don't
push
the
red
button
yet.
His
heart's
gonna
stop.
There's
only
time
for
one
charge
before
he
passes
out.
Take
the
blue
combipen,
Bond.
That'll
counteract
the
digitalis.
You're
going
to
pass
out
in
a
few
seconds
Push
the
red
button
now,
Bond.
-
Bond,
push
the
damn
button!
-
You
okay?
-
Thank
you.
-
Now
get
yourself
off
to
a
hospital.
As
soon
as
I've
won
this
game.
You're
not
seriously
going
back
there?
I
wouldn't
dream
of
it.
Bet.
One
million.
-
All
in.
Two
pair.
Aces
and
sevens.
Queen
plays.
Wins.
Oh,
I'm
sorry.
Gentlemen,
with
this
chip
exchange,
...which
means
no
more
buy-ins.
The
big
blind
is
now
1
million
dollars.
Four
players.
It's
your
bet.
-
Monsieur
Bond?
-
Check.
Check.
And
check.
All
check.
Four
players.
-
Check.
All

Six

Bet.
Six

Five

All

Bet
is

Twelve

Heads

Forty
million,
500,000.
All

Raise.
All

Well,
I
think
I
will
call
you
on
that
one.
Call.
One
hundred
and
fifteen
million
in
the
pot.
Gentlemen,
showdown,
please.
Flush.
Ace,
king,
queen.
Full
house.
Eights
full
of
aces.
A
higher
full

Aces
full
of
sixes.
Monsieur
Bond.
Five
and
seven
of
spades.
A
straight
flush.
Four
to
the
eight.
The
high
hand.
Monsieur
Bond
wins.
-
For
you.
Congratulations.
-
He's
all
yours.
Congratulations.
You
know,
I
think
a
celebration's
in
order.
You
were
almost
dead
an
hour
ago.
Come
on,
I'm
famished.
Thank
you.
Mathis
says
the
Americans
have
made
contact
with
Le
Chiffre.
They're
going
to
extract
him
before
dawn.
-
You
know,
I
think
I'll
call
that
a
Vesper.
No.
Because
once
you've
tasted
it,
that's
all
you
want
to
drink.
-
I
thought
that
was
quite
a
good
line.
But
you're
laughing
at
it.
-
Not
so
much
it
as
you.
I
figured
out
what
that
is.
It's
an
Algerian
love
knot.
Really?
I
thought
it
was
just
something
pretty.
No,
you
didn't.
Someone
gave
that
to
you.
He's
a
very
lucky
man.
You
can
switch
off
so
easily,
can't
you?
It
doesn't
bother
you,
killing
those
people?
Well,
I
wouldn't
be
very
good
at
my
job
if
it
did.
I
don't
believe
you.
You've
got
a
choice,
you
know?
Just
because
you've
done
something
Why
is
it
people
who
can't
take
advice
always
insist
on
giving
it?
You
think
I
can't
take
my
own
advice?
I
think
something
is
driving
you.
And
I
think
I'll
never
find
out
what
that
is.
Mathis
needs
me.
Good
night.
Congratulations
again.
Mathis.
I'm
afraid
your
friend
Mathis
is
really...
...my
friend
Mathis.
You've
taken
good
care
of
your
body.
Such
a
waste.
You
know
I
never
understood
all
these
elaborate
tortures.
It's
the
simplest
thing
to
cause
more
And
of
course
it's
not
only
the
immediate
agony,
but
the
knowledge...
...that
if
you
do
not
yield
soon
enough...
...there
will
be
little
left
to
identify
you
as
a
man.
The
only
question
remains
will
you
yield
in
time?
I
want
the
money.
Miss
Lynd
will
give
me
the
account
number,
if
she
hasn't
already.
So
all
I
need
from
you
is
the
password.
The
password,
please.
I've
got
a
little
itch
down
there.
Would
you
mind?
No!
No!
No!
No.
To
the
right.
You
are
a
funny
man,
Mr.
Bond.
Yeah!
Yes,
yes,
yes.
Now
the
whole
world's
gonna
know
that
you
died
scratching
my
balls.
I
died?
-
I
died?
Because
no
matter
what
you
do,
I'm
not
gonna
give
you
the
password,...
...which
means
your
clients
are
gonna
hunt
you
down
and
Because
if
you
kill
me
there'll
be
nowhere
else
to
hide.
But
you
are
so
wrong!
Because
even
after
I
slaughtered
you
and
your
little
girlfriend...
...your
people
would
still
welcome
me
with
open
arms...
...because
they
need
what
I
know.
The
big
picture.
Give
me
the
password
and
I
will
at
least
let
her
live.
Bond.
Do
it
soon
enough
and
she
might
even
be
in
one
piece.
-
You
really
aren't
going
to
tell
me,
are
you?
So
I
think...
...I'll
feed
you
what
you
seem
not
to
value.
I'll
get
the
money.
Tell
them
I'll
get
the
money.
Money
isn't
as
valuable
to
our
organization
as
knowing
who
to
trust.
Francesco.
Francesco.
Vesper.
Vesper.
No.
Not
him.
Not
Mathis.
No.
I'll
get
the
doctor.
Not
him.
Any
ideas?
-
What?
Where
is
she?
Sleeping.
Well,
I'm
supposed
to
get
you
to
drink
this.
It's
just
odd
killing
everyone
else
but
leaving
you
and
her
untouched.
Almost
as
if
someone
was
trying
to
tell
us
something.
Get
a
look
at
the
killer?
No.
Shame.
Drink
up.
Anything
else
you
remember?
-
Anything
that
can
help
us?
Or
help
you?
-
Hello.
You
all
right?
I
can't
resist
waking
you.
Every
time
I
do,
you
look
at
me
as
if
you
haven't
seen
me
in
years.
It
makes
me
feel
reborn.
If
you'd
just
been
born
wouldn't
you
be
naked?
You
have
me
there.
You
can
have
me
anywhere.
I
can?
Yeah.
Here,
there,
anywhere
you
like.
Does
this
mean
that
you're
warming
to
me?
Yeah.
That's
how
I
would
describe
it.
It's
just
that
not
so
long
ago
...I'm
trying
to
think
of
a
better
word
than
"loathing."
I'm
afraid
I'm
a
complicated
woman.
That
is
something
to
be
afraid
of.
-
Hello.
Monsieur
Mendel.
My
apologies,
I
do
not
mean
to
rush,
but
a
120
million
is
a
large
sum
of
money.
It
certainly
is.
I'm
afraid
not.
If
you
would
type
in
the
account
number.
And
now
the
password.
You
can
do
that.
I
would
if
I
knew
what
it
was.
V-E-S...
...-P-E-R.
The
funds
have
been
transferred.
Sorry
for
disturbing
you.
-
Auf
Wiedersehen.
You
know,
James...
...I
just
want
you
to
know
that
if
all
that
was
left
of
you...
...was
your
smile
and
your
little
finger...
...you'd
still
be
more
of
a
man
than
anyone
I've
ever
met.
That's
because
you
know
what
I
can
do
with
my
little
finger.
-
I
have
no
idea.
You're
not
going
to
let
me
in
there,
are
you?
You've
got
your
armor
back
on.
That's
that.
I
have
no
armor
left.
You've
stripped
it
from
me.
Whatever
is
left
of
me...
...whatever
I
am
I'm
yours.
I
suppose
M
won't
miss
me
for
a
couple
of
days.
-
She'll
be
too
busy
sweating
Mathis.
Remember
I
told
you
about
Le
Chiffre's
tell?
Well,
Mathis
told
Le
Chiffre.
That's
how
he
wiped
me
out.
Same
goes
for
the
implant.
I
can't
believe
it.
No,
neither
could
I.
I
thought
he
had
my
back.
But
there
you
go,
lesson
learned.
Does
everyone
have
a
tell?
Yes.
Everyone.
Everyone
except
you.
I
wonder
if
that's
why
I
love
you.
You
love
me?
Enough
to
quit
and
float
round
the
world
with
you
But
I
think
that's
gonna
have
to
be
you.
You're
serious.
Like
you
said...
...you
do
what
I
do
for
too
long
I'm
leaving
with
what
little
I
have
left.
Is
that
enough
for
you?
-
Come
on.
No,
stop
it.
Stop.
What's
the
time?
How
much
do
you
think
we
need
to
float
for
a
month?
I've
got
plenty.
No,
I
want
to
pay
for
my
half
of
our
aimless
wanderings.
You
stopped
wearing
the
necklace.
Yeah.
It
was
time.
Time
enough
to
get
over
someone?
To
realize
sometimes
you
can
forget
the
past.
Though
apparently
not
your
employer.
Back
in
one
month.
Come
on.
I'll
get
the
money
you
get
supplies.
I'll
see
you
back
here
in
half
an
hour.
-
Hello,
M.
-
Yes?
Right
now
I
have
a
lovely
man
from
the
Treasury
here
That's
a
shame.
Yes.
Well,
I
told
them
not
to
worry.
So
you'll
be
depositing
it
today.
On
my
way
to
the
bank
right
now.
James
Bond
for
Mr.
Mendel.
Hello.
Mr.
Mendel?
It
was
transferred
to
the
account
number
your
company
gave
us,
Mr.
Bond.
It
appears
the
funds
are
being
withdrawn
as
we
speak.
-
Where?
Is
there
a
problem,
Mr.
Bond?
I'll
kill
her!
Allow
me.
I'm
sorry,
James.
She
had
a
boyfriend.
They
were
very
much
in
love.
He
was
kidnapped
by
the
organization
behind
Le
Chiffre.
And
they
blackmailed
her,
threatening
to
kill
him
unless
she
cooperated.
We
should've
picked
up
on
it
but
sometimes
we're
so
How
are
you
doing?
She
left
her
cell
phone.
She
must
have
known
I'd
check
it.
She
knew
you
were
you.
-
Well,
at
least
this
clears
Mathis.
-
No?
We
just
proved
that
she's
guilty,
not
that
he's
innocent.
It
could've
been
a
double
blind.
-
You
don't
trust
anyone,
do
you,
James?
Then
you've
learnt
your
lesson.
Get
back
as
soon
as
you
can.
Will
do.
-
If
you
do
need
time....
The
job's
done,
and
the
bitch
is
dead.
James
did
you
ever
ask
yourself
why
you
weren't
killed
that
night?
Isn't
it
obvious?
She
made
a
deal
to
spare
your
life
in
exchange
for
the
money.
I'm
sure
she
hoped
they
would
let
her
live.
But
she
must
have
known
she
was
going
to
her
death.
And
now
we'll
never
know
who
was
behind
this.
The
trail's
gone
cold.
-
Hello.
We
need
to
talk.
Who
is
this?
The
name's
Bond.
James
Bond.
