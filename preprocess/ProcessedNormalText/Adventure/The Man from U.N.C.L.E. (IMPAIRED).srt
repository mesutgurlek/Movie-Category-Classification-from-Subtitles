WOMAN
:

You
look
important.
Or,
at
least,
your
suit
does.
Well,
I
can
get
you
over
the
Wall.
Would
you
consider
that
important,
A
smart
mouth
to
go
with
the
suit.
Statements
like
that
can
get
you
Or
they
can
get
you
out
of
it.
Make
yourself
comfortable,
Okay,
Mr.
Important-Suit.
I'm
here
to
have
a
chat
I
don't
have
a
father.
I
don't
mean
your
late
foster
father,
I
mean
your
real
father.
Dr.
Udo
Teller.
-
Hitler's
favorite
rocket
scientist.
You're
wasting
your
time.
Well,
after
the
war,
He'd
been
enjoying
the
American
dream.
Had
a
great
job
working
pleasant
house
in
the
suburbs...
a
new
Cadillac
and
a
fat
little
dog
Then,
two
years
ago,
he
disappeared

Until
now.
This
was
taken
Which
one
is
supposed
to
be
my
father?
Funny.
I'm
told
that
if
your
father's
knowledge
things
could
get
a
little
messy.
You
know,
end
of
the
world.
What
makes
you
think
I
know
where
he
is?
I
don't
think
you
do,
but
I
think
Your
mother's
brother:
Uncle
Rudi.
I've
also
been
told
actually
a
Nazi.
He
was
forced
to
work
for
them.
So
I'm
here
to
help
him.
-
Why
don't
you
help
me.
If
I
had
15
minutes,
I'd
talk,
you'd
laugh,
Unfortunately,
I
don't.
So
my
offer
is
come
with
me
now...
and
be
at
a
chic
little
hotel
Or
stay
here
and
spend
the
night
hanging
from
a
pipe,
That
is
what
I
was
looking
for.
Do
you
mind
terribly
Could
you
pass
me
that
brown
paper
bag
Are
they
still
following
us?
Yes.

Is
there
one
of
them?
Just
hum
if
there
is.
-
Mm-hm.
Mm.
SOLO:
Does
he
have
just
one
hand
Mm-hm.
When
you
hear
something
drive.


Did
you
get
him?
Let's
hope
he
doesn't
drive

I
got
news
for
you.
He
does.
SOLO:
Make
a
right.

And
then
an
immediate
left.

Nicely
done.
Hold
on.

GABY:
Is
he
gone?
You
know,
I
don't
think
so.
Reverse
down
the
sidewalk...
then
drive
around
the
block.
And,
uh,
meet
me
back
here.

You

You
can't

He's
trying
to
stop
the
car.

GABY:
We're
struggling
here.
Why
don't
you
take
a
shot
at
him.
Somehow
it
just
doesn't
seem
like

First
left,
then
immediate

-
This
road
isn't
going
anywhere.
-
It's
getting
narrower.
Put
your

down

Good
plan.
All
we
have
to
do
is
get
over
Now
what?

Take
another

After

Hug
me.

SOLO:
Jones,
reverse!

Step
back.
This
place
isn't
chic.
It
isn't
even

No.
But
it's
safer.
What's
that?
Smells
like

Expensive

He's

Our

I

Miss
Teller
was
helpful.
You
were
right.

That's

That's

He

I

Don't

for

You
should've
seen

Grow

Solo.
Contrary
to
what
you
may
think,
I
don't
think
you
understand.
Remind
me,
Solo.
You
owe
me
five
more
years.
Now,
I
know
you've
been...
taking
care
of
yourself
on
the
side.
You're
wetting
your

so

We

Well,

She's

that

she's

about

what

is
what

counteract

at
the
end
of
a
very
long
leash
I'm
sure
you
understand
humiliation.
Really?
-
How
so?
I
thought
I
should
read
up
on
you.
Rather
a
sad
story,
what
with
your
dad
and
a
top
government
official
right
up
until
he
was
caught
How
old
were

I
do
wonder
if
it
was
your

Or...
was

I
understand
that
she

extremely
popular

was

to
Siberia.
GABY:
America
is
teaming
up
with
Russia.
Is
this
a
joke?
It
should
tell
you
To
everyone.
I'm
not
going
back
behind

And
at
the
end
of
this,
You
don't
have

Because

No,

no.
No!
Smoothly
done.

Wait.
Give

of

he's

He's
also
managed
to
secure

naturally,
you'd

about

What's
your

much
of

You'll

fine.
No.

These

are
all
in
your
size.

architect
traveling
to
Rome...
would
never
dress
his
woman
You
tried
to
dress
her
like
someone
someone
dress
behind
the
Iron
Curtain.
She's
from
behind
the
Iron
Curtain.
That
doesn't
mean
We
need
two
purses,
please.
And
grab
that
belt.
Uh,
no.
No,
not
the
Dior,
the
Rabanne.
You
can't
put
a
Paco

belt

She's
not
going
to
wear

Nothing.
If
you're
fat.
The
Dior
goes
with
the
Rabanne.
It
won't
match.
It
doesn't
have
to
match.
GABY:
It
costs
more
than
my
car.
You
can
get
back
I'll
see
you
in
Rome.
Not
bad.
I
like
this.
Yes.
But
it's
missing...
a
little
something.
Now
we
are
engaged.
Congratulations.
-
Enjoy
your
stay,
Mr.
Waverly.
Jack
Deveny.
Checking
in.
-
Welcome
to
Rome,
Mr.
Deveny.
I
have
a
quick
errand
to
run.
Could
you
have
my
bag
taken
-
Of
course.
Luigi.

GABY:
Where
are
we
going?
The
same
place
every
architect
goes
To
see
the
sights.
GABY:
Mm.
So,
Mr.
Architect...
I'm
sure
you've
done
your
homework.
Why
don't
you
tell
me
a
bit
Good
question.
The
Steps
were
constructed
in
1723...
credited
to
two
Italian
architects.
Really,
built
by
Russian.
Sergei
Ivanov.
Now,
Sergei
also
had
mother,
Yagoda...
who
introduced
him
and
whom
he
revered
as
his
muse.
Unfortunately
for
Sergei,
his
mother
died
So
in
memory
of
his
beloved
Yagoda...
he
make
one
step
of
his
mother's
life.
So
she
died
at
135.
No.
She
died
at
100.
He
was
35.
So
135
steps.
Impressive.
So
she
gave
birth
at
the
age
of
65?
No.
I...
Evening,
comrade.
You're
not
supposed
-
You're
being
followed.
Two
men

They

So
I
imagine
I
will
handle
them.
"Handle"?
Just
to
avoid
any
confusion,
you
do
mean
"Scared"?
-
What's
going
on?
Someone
is
trying
to
make
sure
and
not
someone
KGB
agent,
for
example.
I
said,
you
are
not
needed
here.
I
think
you
should
do
as
he
says.
And
remember:
Take
it
like
a
pussy.
This
is
not
the
Russian
way.

Nice
shoes.
Thank
you.
Perhaps
you
give
them
to
me.
I
think
your
feet
are
a
little
small.
Then
give
me
some
money
for
coffee.
Hmm?
Dearest...
give
the
gentlemen
something
for
coffee.
Enjoy
your
coffee.

Nice
watch.
-
Darling,
give
him
the
watch.
Mm.
Thank
you.
Give
me
the
watch!
Give
him
the
watch!
GABY:
Illya.
Do
as
he
says.


Calm
down.

Not
very
good
That
man
stole
my
father's
watch.
Aren't
you
supposed
Da,
but
a
Russian
architect
would
fight.
Russian
agent
would've
killed
them
both.
So
it's
no
trouble
unless
you
continue
So
you've
actually
thought
this
through.
Would
you
like
GABY:
Don't!
You
two
are
supposed
So
why
am
I
playing
mother,
huh?
Either
you
start
to
look
like
you
know
or
I'm
out
of
here.

It's
open.
Good
evening,
Mr.
Deveny.
With
the
compliments
of
the
hotel.
I
apologize
it
wasn't
Thank
you
very
much.
Is
there
anything
else
I
can
do
for
you?
It's
a
fine
bottle
of
champagne.
Oh.
Uh...
I'm
still
on
duty,
Mr.
Deveny.
Pity.
But
my
shift
ends
in
five
minutes.
I'm
sure
we
can
find
something
to
do


There's
a
party
tomorrow
of
Vinciguerra
Shipping.
Uncle
Rudi
has
invited
us.
-
Drink?

Would
you
like
bigger
glass?
I
will
finish
this
bottle.
The
only
question
is...
are
you
gonna
help
me
or
not?
No.
Thank
you.

is
fun?

enjoyed

night.
Is
better

What
does

try
not
to
disappoint.
You
see,
each
one
of
us
has
a
destiny.
And
I

I
can
help
you
with
yours.
You
can
see

Darling,
time
to

Sorry.

GABY:
Darling,
I'll
be
a
minute.
What
are
you
doing?
Another
time,
perhaps.
-
Leaving
so
soon?
But
we've
had
a
wonderful
time.
Where's
Peril?
He's
been
in
there
half
an
hour.
You've
been
spending
a
lot
of
time
Apparently,
you
put

He

And

They
had
it
coming.
You
need
to
control

Your
new

is
a

How
did
you
find
Alexander

I
think
he's
an
athletic,
who's
offered
me
a
job
ILLYA:
Still
a
Nazi.
I
quite
like
him.
Yes,
but
is
he
up
to
no
good?
If
you
mean
by
"no
good,"
is
he
trying

The
answer's
yes.
I
don't
know
what
you're
upset
about.
As
far
as
he
is
concerned,
I
am.
And
for
the
purpose
So,
like
I
said,
it's
not
happening.

you

I'm
gonna
go
sleep
on
this.

Is
this
what
you
call
sleeping
on
it?
You're
welcome.
The
thing
is...
I
work
better
alone.
I
work
better
alone
too.
I'm
not
leaving.
We
have
approximately
10
minutes
Want
to
sit

talk
about

Okay.
I'll
let

it's

we
both
forget

Is
there
anything
I
can
do

help?

Just
let
me
do
it.

Pfft.
Shall
we?

your
work,

You

I'll
take

Meet
me

not

I
didn't
find
anything.


Wait.

Why?
I
thought
that
was
my
father's
watch.
And,
uh,
what
exactly
did
you
do
to
him?
At

we
call
it

It

The

It's
a
flaw
I
intend
to
exploit.
Still...
very
difficult

open.
But
it's

And
the
flaw
was...

You're

ILLYA:
Just
shut
up
and
watch
me
work.

Hold
on,

Hmm.

Keep
quiet.

Follow
me.




Mr.
Deveny's
room,
please.

VICTORIA
:

Hello?
RUDI
:

Gaby.

Room
304,
please.
The
meeting
is
confirmed.
Sorry,
Mrs.
Vinciguerra,
Key.
What's
going
on?
Where's
my
case?

Hello,
Victoria.
Grape?

You've
bugged
him?
He
tried
to
bug
me.





He
doesn't
sound
You
sure
Victoria
believed
you?
I
gave
it
everything
I
had.
Believe
me.
I
also
got
another
meeting
So,
what,
we
just
let
Gaby
go
If
there's
a
chance
he'll
lead
us
This
could
be
like
leading
lamb
Going
soft,
Peril?
What
you
talking
about?

-
Good
morning.
Your
tracker's
not
sending
a
signal.
Have
you
turned
it
on?
I
think
so.
Or
do
you
want
to
check
it?
Be
my
guest.
It's
your
tracker.
You're
the
expert.

They're
still
cold.
Sorry.
What
are
you
doing
down
there?
Trying
not
to
get
lost.
-
You're
trembling.
It's
going
to
be
okay.
How
do
you
know?
I'll
be...
I'll
be
close
by.
All
turned
on
now?
Uncle
Rudi's
car
has
arrived.
Are
you
ready?

GABY:

(WHIRRING
AND

So
your
Uncle
Rudi
thinks
I
know
my
father
is
here.
And
that
he
works
for
you.
And
how
is
that?
Simple.
I
think
I
need
to
make
a
telephone
call.
Perhaps
you've
come
to
us
Your
father's
work
ethic
has
been,
Your
presence
will
provide
You
leave
my
father
to
me.

Madame
Vinciguerra
will
be
She
would
like
it
Thank
you.
Help
yourself
to
a
drink.

So
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting.
You
don't
look
like
you
slept
much
Funny
you
should
say
that,
Don't
think
this
Scotch
If
I
were
a
suspicious
man,
It's
much
easier
to
trust
a
drink
But
how
did
you
know
I
didn't.
I
laced
all
the
drinks.
I
don't
like
to
leave
much
to
chance...
Mr.
Solo.
-
I
thought
I
was
doing
so
well.
You
were
doing
fantastically
well.
The
fault
doesn't
lie
However,
you
couldn't
control
She
gave
you
up
like
an
unwanted
kitten.
GABY:
I
know
my
father
is
here.
ALEXANDER:
And
how
is
that?
Simple.
My
fiancé's
a
KGB
agent.
And
the
American
your
wife
has
The
Russians
and
Americans
thought
but
I
was
using
them
to
get
to
you.
Really?
She
seemed
so
innocent.
You're
not
the
first
man
for
the
charms
of
a
pretty,
young
woman.
GABY:
It's
a
tracking
device.
He's
probably
out
there
in
the
woods.
Watching
us
right
now.
I'm
sure
my...
fiancé
can
confirm
everything
I've
said.
If
you
can
catch
him.
I
think
I
need
to
make
a
telephone
call.


What
are
you
doing?
I've
been
here
before.
And
last
time,
I
fell
rather
badly
I'm
afraid
that
isn't
going
Sleep
well,

Only
my

hello.
You
may
have

and
my
personal
favorite:
the
Fifth

What
history
has
failed
to
relate
is
but
the
tireless

And
today,
you
have
the
privilege...
of
experiencing
his
work
firsthand.
Hello
again,
Mr.
Solo.


My
apologies.
There's
a
short
in
the
wiring.
I
thought
I'd
located
it.

I
keep
telling
the

he's
a
hopeless
sentimentalist.
(ELECTRICITY

We
have
contact.
RUDI:
My
apologies.
Won't
happen
again.

So
sorry
I
can't
stay
Rudi's
never
in
a
rush,
but
sadly,
I
am.
And
I
want
it
to
be
slow.
I'll
send
your
regards
to
little
Gaby.

Once
upon
a
time,
You
wouldn't
describe
him...
as
a
particularly
special
little
boy.
He
was
neither
tall
nor
handsome,
In
fact,
he
appeared
Because
of
this
boy's
he
was
bullied
mercilessly...
and
relentlessly
by
the
other
children.
Year
merged
with
miserable
year...
as
life
continued
to
be
a
living
hell.
But
what
the
other
boys
didn't
that
he
didn't
see
them
as
enemies.
He
saw
them
as
instruments
of
learning.
A
priceless
lesson
was
gleaned
Man...
has
only
two
masters
in
this
world.
And
their
names
are
Pain
and
Fear.
The
boy
found...
he
had
quite
a
talent
for
eliciting
So
on
the
principle
of
playing
he
decided
to
make
their
cultivation
Fortunately
for
this
boy...
history
gave
him
A
world
war.


The
canvas...
Mr.
Solo...
on
which
he
would
produce
You
will
go
here,
Mr.
Solo.
A
whole
page
just
for
you.
And
not
in
black
and
white,
Kodachrome.
The
colors
are
so
real,
Ready?



There
are
two
kinds
of...
torture,
Mr.
Solo.
One
is
for
the
extraction
The
other...
is
for
its
own
sake.


I
must
admit
this
does
get
frustrating.
Ah!
But
fortunately...
I'm
in
an
old-fashioned
mood.
I
think
we'll
start...
with
the
pliers.
I
never
thought
I'd
say
this.
I'm
actually
quite
pleased
to
see
you.
You
doing
okay,
cowboy?
-
SOLO:
I
thought
I
found
all
your
trackers.
Just
not
the
ones
in
your
shoes.

Do
you
mind?
You
don't
have
to
do
things
to
me
to
You
won't
be
able
to
stop
me.
-
What
about
Gaby?

SOLO:
Don't
kick
yourself.
-
She
fooled
me
too.


-
They
have
a
glitch.
Wait.
Please,
wait.
-
SOLO:
Do
you
still
have
Teller?
Has
he
succeeded
Oh,
we
are
way
beyond
that.
There's
already
a
bomb,
The
Reichsmarschall
will
take
delivery
They're
sending
a
submarine.
Between
that
time
and
now,
on
Vinciguerra
Island,
I'll
appear
in
court.
I
don't
even
need
to
know
them.
Heh.
I'm
yours
to
command.
Will
you
give
us
a
minute?
Don't
go
anywhere.
I'll
be
right
here.
What
should
we
do?
-
We
have
to
get
to
that
island.

(ELECTRICITY
CRACKLING
It's
your
call.
You're
the
one
On
the
one
hand...
we
need
him,
But
on
the
other
hand...
I
know
exactly
what'll
happen.
He'll
strike
a
deal
He's
prepared
to
sell
his
ass
on
this,
He'll
be
out
within
months.
Or
worse.
They'll
offer
him
a
job.
A
man
with
that
skill
set's
-
So,
what
do
you
think
we
should
do?
Huh.
He
fixed
the
glitch.
Damn.
I
left
my
jacket
in
there.
I'll
let
you
two
get
reacquainted.
ILLYA:
Okay.
Thank
you.
That
got
their
attention.
They'll
have
chopper
waiting
for
us

Gaby.

Mr.
Solo.
We
meet
again.
Mr.
Kuryakin.
My
name's
Waverly.
I
believe
your
instructions
are
follow
me.

Very
well
done,
my
darling.
They
will
send
an
army
to
stop
us.
Then
we
must
give
them
WOMAN:
The
line
is
secured.
You
will
report
to
Commander
Waverly...
of
British
Naval
Intelligence
OLEG
:
It
is
vital
you
retrieve
Dr.
Teller
They
are
the
key
to
the
U.S.
of
A.
Kill
the
Russian,
if
necessary.
OLEG:
Gentlemen,
can
you
hear
me?
Well,
now
if
the
Nazis
are
due
of
this
bomb
at
0800,
that
gives
us...
a
luxurious
14
hours
in
which
and
winkle
out
poor
Professor
Teller.
There
is
also,
of
course,
the,
uh,
-
You
have
British
agent
in
this?
-
"She"?
I'm
starting
to
smell
the
irony.
Gaby's
working
for
you,
isn't
she?
Well
done,
Solo,
yep,
yeah.
You
got
there
in
the
end.


My
father
has
been
unwell.
That
and
the
stress
led
to
self-doubt.
-
A
daughter's
touch.
To
assure
I
finish
in
time.
-
Now
that
is
a
good
idea.
The
thing
is,
Kuryakin,
we
assumed
his
Nazi
colleagues
would
so
we
recruited
her,
and
waited.
And
what
we
got,
of
course,
was
you
two.
I've
been
meaning
to
thank
you
very
much
You're
wrong.
Yes.
I
told
her
to.
The
meeting
is
confirmed.
WAVERLY:
You
were
about
to
be
exposed,
Kuryakin.
The
only
way
she
could
stay
in
the
game.
She
knew
the
ring
and
you'd
be
listening
If
you
can
catch
him.
WAVERLY:
and
you
are
not
average,
SOLO:
You
told
Gaby
to
drop
us
in
it,
But
now
you've
lost
her,
so
you
need
us
Well,
that
is
a
very
poor
translation,
Well,
in
a
nutshell,
yes,
please,
I
think
it's
rather
nice.
We're
obviously
all
very
fond
of
Gaby

Terrific.
We're
a
little
early.
What
is
that?
It's
an
aircraft
carrier,
Kuryakin.
For
a
special
agent,
you're
not
having
TELLER:
Reflector
lens.
So,
what
does
that
do?
Well,
it's
known
as
a
coupler.
It
sends
a
signal
to
lock
onto
this
one
It's
left
over
from
when
this
was
a
warhead
Now
that
we
are
converting
it
GABY:
I'm
sorry.
We're
nearly
done,
Victoria.
Those
are
the
words
-
What
are
you
doing?
Put
her
in
a
cell.
If
you
don't
hear
from
me
That's
how
long
you
have
to
finish
this.
You
can
start
by
putting
back
WAVERLY:
So
Vinciguerra
Island.
The
plot
is,
and
stop
me
a
stealth
attack
on
the
island
We
shall
go
in
through
the
front
door
Jockelson
and
his
men
will
get
you
The
rest
is
up
to
you.
It's
done.
And
with
three
minutes
to
spare.
The
computer
disk
And
the
backup.

What
about
Gaby?
She'll
be
joining
you
shortly.


Looks
like
we
found
Dr.
Teller.

ILLYA:
The
bomb
was
here.

Hmm.
SOLO:
Illya,
come
in.
I'm
here.
Alexander
has
Gaby
and
the
bomb.





Illya!

Hold
on!




GABY:
Solo!



Cowboy.
I'll
be
okay,
Peril.

It's
okay.

Well
done,
chaps.
Just
one
small
snag.
Wrong
warhead.
SOLO:
So
it's
a
decoy.
No,
no,
no,
it's
a
real
bomb.
But
not
nuclearized.
There
was
a
second
warhead
in
the
lab.
Did
you
check
everything
I
asked?
Radar,
sonar,
aerial
patrols...
all
report
no
other
vehicles
That
includes
submarines.
What
about
fishing
boats
leaving
The
boats
go
out
every
morning
at

I
saw
them.
How
many
of
them

there?
Almost
100.
They
are

you

You
can
get

we
keep
them
broadcasting
I
have
an
idea




Ten
minutes
and
counting.
Mr.
Solo,
this
is
your
cue.
Thank
you.
Diadema,
this
is

Solo.
Hello,
Victoria.
I
suspect
so
I'll
give
you
this
message
directly.
Earlier
today...
I
killed
your
husband.
We're
wasting
our
time.
If
you
could
just
shut
up,
Ramp
it
up,
please,
Solo.
I'd
like
to
report
that
he
died
honorably,
But
he
didn't.
Instead,
it
was
a
rather
pitiful
affair
and
offers
to
trade
anything
so
that
I
would
spare
his
life.
Napoleon.
I
appreciate
your
message...
and
now
I
hope
you'll
appreciate
mine.

blood
relation
of
yours
still
living
They
will
die
slowly
and
painfully.
And
you
know
from
personal
experience,

Bearing
0-4-5,
captain.
There's
nothing
you'll
be
able
to
do
as
you
await
your
own
death,
-
This
I
vow
on
my
husband's
soul.
Won't
you
have
to
inform
After
we
deliver
the
warhead
it
will
be
the
first
item
on
my
agenda.
And
you
will
die,
Solo,
We
have
the
professor's
disk.
We
can
build
as
many
bombs
as
we
need.

SMITH:

I
see
one
flaw
in
that
plan.
Entertain
me.
While
you've
been
telling
me
we've
been
locking
on
You
can
get

we
keep
them

we
have
your
general
location.
It
won't
help
you
much.
I
haven't
finished.
The
coupling
device
that
you
so
considerately
is
accurate
to
10
feet.
I
have
an
idea
It's
known
as
a
coupler.
A
signal,
which
enables
to
lock
onto
this
one
The
coupling
device
is
now
activated,
SOLO:
That
warhead...
although
not
nuclear...
shouldn't
have
any
trouble
obliterating
The
aforementioned
warhead
launched...
-
Ready.
45
seconds
ago...
giving
you
about
30
seconds
It
won't
trigger
the
nuclear
warhead...
as
that
requires
fission.

SOLO:
So...
if
you
do
want
to
make
good
I
suggest
you
abandon
ship
immediately.
How's
that
for
entertainment?
Very
good.
Well
done,
Solo.
GABY:
All
packed?
The
bellboy
is
on
his
way
up.
It's
time
to
go
home.
How
about
you?
I'm
not
going
back
to
East
Germany.
No,
that
is
probably
not
a
good
idea
I'm
sorry.
I
really
wanted
to
tell
you,
but...
It's
okay.
I
would
have
done
exactly
Mm.
I'm
sorry
about
your
father.
I
lost
him
a
long
time
ago.
Cowboy's
invited
us
for
a
drink
up,
I
have
to
see
Waverly.
In
case
we
don't
see
each
other
again.
No.
You
should
keep
it.
As
souvenir.
That
way
I
can
keep
track
of
you.




Hello.


OLEG:





Come
in.
Just
finishing
up.
Fix
us
a
couple
of
drinks.
I
guess
it's
business
as
usual
now.
Back
to
how
things
were.
Politics
being
what
they
are.
You
feeling
okay?
So,
what
now?
Mission
accomplished?
Head
back
to
Russia?
Something
like
this.
Yes.
You?
New
York.
Almost
forgot.
Got
something
for
you.
You
know
what
my
mission
is?
Same
as
mine
was.
Kill
me
if
necessary...
to
get
that.

Absolutely
hated
working
You're
a
terrible
spy,
Cowboy.

Good
evening,
gentlemen.
Rather
touching
scene.
Nice
view,
glass
of
whiskey...
and
a
little
bonfire
to
keep
you
warm.
Rather
good
idea.
So
I
have
news.
A
fresh
little
unpleasantness
I've
spoken
to
your
superiors,
they've
kindly
agreed
to
let
me
keep
-
We
leave
in
an
hour.
Istanbul,
Kuryakin.
You'll
need
your
curly-wurly
shoes.
-
Oh,
and
you
have
a
new
code
name.
Yes,
rather
a
good
one:
U.N.C.L.E.
