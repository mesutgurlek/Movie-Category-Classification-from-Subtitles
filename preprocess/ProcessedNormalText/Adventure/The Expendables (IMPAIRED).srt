Why

like
a
A
Charlette's
Web
on
your
head
Something
different,
something
exciting
...
I
can
put
a
web
on
the
top
of
the
head...
Maybe
a
pregnant
Charlette
coming
out
of
your
ear
Making
sure
them
bugs
don't
come
inside...
Her
long
legs
dangling
down

-
General!
Now
we
can
see
inside
of
him
And
I
see
lies
He
wasn't
stealing
from
you,
he
was
stealing
from
us
Both
Want
to
rate
respect?
Let's
just
keep
it
simple,
if
the
money's
right
Let's
quit
jerkin'
off...
Get
down
to
business,
see
who's
hungry.
You
don't
need
to
know
my
name
The
only
thing
you
need
to
know
is
that
the
job's
real...
and
the
money's
real.
And
since
we're
in
this
beautiful
place
Just
Call
me
Mr.
Church
Ok,
Church,

can
I
do
for
you?
In

Still
waiting
for
one
more
guy.
Who?
You
know
him?
-
What's
my
oldest
worst
friend
doin'
here?
Both
your
names
came
to
the
top
of
the
list.
Is
this
a
problem?
Yeah,

a
chance.
Big

Praying

work?
Could

Have

You've

weight
Really?
Well,
whatever

pal.
You

aren't
gonna
start
sucking
Let's
get
down
to
business,
Ever
hear
of
an
island
called
Valiena?
No
Yes
It's
a
little
island
in
the
Gulf
-
You
should
read
more
Thanks
There
are
resources
on
that
island
that
my
But
a
general
by
the
name
of
Garza
has
overthrown
That's
right
My
people
are
having
a
problem
with
this
fanatic
Garza
So
you
want
Garza
gone
-
All
it
takes
is
a
little
army.
Only
an
idiot
would
do
this
job
How
much?
Well,
like
I
said...
I'm
busy
anyway,
so
give
this
job
to
my
Right?
Right
-
Why
don't
we
have
dinner?
Sure,

In
a
thousand
years
Too
soon
What's
his
fuckin'
problem?
He
wants
to
be
governor
I
gotta
recon
this
island
first
I
have
a
contact
for
you
on
the
island
Good
riddance
I
got
the
feelin'
that
everyone
else
has
passed
5
million?
I
want
half
up
front,
the
other
half
in
an
offshore
account,
No
What
I
have
a
problem
with
is
people
who
try
to
fuck
me
over
So
if
you
take
this
money
And
you
don't
deliver
or
you
try
to
fuck
me
with
some
kinda
weird
Me,
and
my
people
are
gonna
come
get
you
and
your
people
and
chop
you
up
into
little
fucking
dog
treats
You
gotta
problem
with
that?
Let's
talk
Valiena
-
They
got
work
there?
Come

I
ain't
got
shit
for
you,
Gunner
Don't

me
I'm

You're
still

I
can't
trust
you
anymore,
man
You
can't
trust
me?
-
You
can't
trust
me?
Be
careful
You
threatening
me,
Gunner?
No
I
am
a
nice
guy
So,
going
over
the
info
this
guy
Church
gave
me,
there's
How
many
soldiers?
Perhaps
a
few
hundred
Wouldn't
take
much
more
than
that
Great.
They
got
a
small
army
And
what
have
we?
Four
and
a
half
men
Not
so
funny
I
need
a
raise.
-
I
need
the
money
for
my
son
I
want
to
send
him
to
a
better
school
When
did
Yen
Yang
get
a
family?
I
have
no
idea
-
I
no
tell
Anyway...
The
pay
share
will
stay
the
same.
Now,
the
target
on
the
island,
a
guy
named
What's
the
problem?
-
We
have
problems
here
is
enough
for
us
That
we
can
not
get
rid
of
them
Totally,
when's
the
last
time
you
seen
your
analyst?
This
morning
-
Avoidant
Personality
Disorder
You
think
too
much
-
You're
an
unusual
guy.
And
you're
always
gonna
Unusual?
You
are
talking
about
my
ear
Oh,
come
on,
don't
start
with
the
ear
again.
Not
again,
we
all
know
the
ear
story
We
all
know
Let's
just
concentrate
on
the
job
-
We
all
know
I
wrestled
in
college
Right
A
common
injury
associated
with
that
sport
is
trama
to
the
ear
a
clot
Which,
if
left
unattended,
causes
a
contraction
in
the
cartilage
And
your
point
is?
-
In
any
case
Me
and
Christmas
are
gonna
head
down
to
Valiena
How
much
pay?
What
family?
My
family
Listen,
that
girl
wasn't
your
type
Her
lost,
right?
-
Maybe
if
you
were
lucky
he
could've
broke
yours
Impossible
You
know,Christmas
I
understand,
but
Let's
just
say
you
were
with
her
for
a
couple
of
hours,
But
after
that,
think
about
it...
What
do
you
do
for
the
rest
of
the
day?
She
probably
did
you
a
favor
You
have
more
time
to
feel
sorry
for
yourself
You
are
a
great
bastard
Good
morning
Good
morning
Good
Morning
-
Big
plane,
huh?
Yeah,
we
use
it
to
tranport
injured
animals
-
Ornithologist
We
are
photographing
exotic
packs
You're
nervous?
-
Why?
-
Do
I
look
nervous?
Yeah,
your
skin
looks
a
little
dry,
I
think
It's
the
altitude
It
is
the
altitude,
it'll
get
to
you
What
is
the
address?
Yes,
it's
in
my
head
Wanna
share
it?
Canteen
Gloria
Spanish
Who
are
you?
Zoro?
Army

You

on
the
suit
Got

Look
at
these
clowns,
hand
picked
monkeys
What's
wrong
with
this
picture?
Everything
Let's
get
out
of
here
What's
the
point?
I
mean,
you
think
you
know
Aren't
you
the
guy
who
said
"The
man
who
can
best
That's
bullshit
Truthfully,
she
wasn't
your
type
I
wasn't
finished
-
Yeah,
you
wait
'til
it
happens
to
you
-
Contact's
late
Alright,
let's
go
Chill
You
ever
been
rejected?
You're
really
pushing
the
boundaries
of
Is
that
our
contact?-
I'll
bet
she's
all
about
it
-
You
the
contact?
-
What
are
your
names?


Follow
me,
please
Buda...Pest...nice.
You
do
all
these?
Yes
Take
one
A
gift
-
How
much
do
you
want
for
it?
-
Taking
nothing
for
something
is-
Is
it
like
this
all
the
time?
This
place
was
a
beautiful
place
Then,
one
day,
they
came
with
money
and
And
the
people
who
fight
back
are
killed
You
said
"THEY
came
with
money".

Who's
they?
Some
Americans
But
one
day
all
this
will
change
You
really
believe
that?
-
The
best
day
will
be
the
one
when
we
can
say
Do
you
have
family,
Sandra?
My
mother
died
when
I
was
small
Sandra,
how
close
can
you
get
to
the
palace?
The
palace?
I
just
wanna...check
out
the
view
there
There
is
no
view
Why
don't
we
just
go
there
anyway,
ok?
Where
is
my
growth?
Where
is
your
manpower?
Do
you
know
how
long
it
takes
Of
course
you
don't,
let
me
tell
you
We
are
8
weeks
behind
schedule
Kick
your
peasants'
asses,
When
you
talk
like
this
to
me
in
front
of
my
men
It's
no
good
I
am
your
lifeline.

I
am
the
one
who
I
am
making
you
rich
And
being
wealthy
is
very
good
It
allows
people
to
be
the
real
ass-wipes
Sometimes
Things
are
just
not
worth
the
money
Sure
they
are
Sandra,
are
we
close?-
Pull
over
please
Where
are
you
going?
Where
am
I
going.
Well,
I
suppose
you
could
say
Do
not
lose
my
hat
We
should
get
goin'
He's
very
emotional
What
are
you
looking
for?
Sandra...
How
do
I
know
you're
not
setting
us
up?
What
does
"setting
us
up"
mean?
You
don't
look
like
the
kind
of
person
we
deal
An
American
came
here.
He
asked
He
was
afraid,
so
he
asked
me
to
And
you're
not
afraid.
I'm
afraid
But
he
said
that
maybe
you
can
help
the
Valiena
I
don't
think
so
Listen
If
I
were
you,
I'd
leave
Just
leave
You
should
leave
Do
not
say
anything,
let
me
speak
Run!
Get
her
-
Are
you
crazy?!
You
could
have
killed
me!
-
Alright,
speed
it
up!
We
are
on
the
way
We
get
out
of
here
it's
a
miracle
She's
coming
with
us,
right?
-
How
can
we
leave?
-
No,
I
can
not
leave
Well,
you
don't
have
no
choice
-
They'll
find
you
in
an
hour
-
Stay
for
what?
Not
to
you
Look,
you
stay
here,
you're
dead.
I
got
the
guys
inside
-
Go.
Go.
Go.
Come
on
Get
in
Get
in!
-
Let's
go
-
There
is
no
time
-
You
look
nervous
Run!
Run,
you
burfbag!
Where
is
the
girl?
-
Won't
leave?
Don't
know
of
anybody
I
don't
believe
this
shit
Climb,
baby,
climb
Goin'
back?
Yeah
-
Ride
&
Die,
Great
job
That
was
a
statement?
How
did
two,
obviously
professionals,
pass
kill
41
soldiers
and
get
away?
With
help,
that's
how
Everything
is
under
control
except
for
A
daughter
Who
wants
her
father
and
company
dead
Some
how
the
Company
parasites
got
to
her.
But
blood
or
not,
she
goes
To
hell
with
the
price
of
lemons
You
don't
kill
your
family
-
Nice
bird
First
of
all,
I
do
not
feel
comfortable
talking
business
Pretty
boy
wouldn't
give
it
up
Not
if
you
wanna
know
where
they
are
What
do
you
know?
I
was
one
of
them
Why
are
you
turning
on
them?
-
We
settled
on
50
-
We
settled
on
a
hundred
grand,
This
guy
thinks
he's
a
real
bad
ass
This
case
is
a
bloody
joke
Life
is
a
joke,
shitface!
If
you
don't
want
that
Fu
Man
Chew
knocked
back
into
Bring
it
Hey!
Be
nice
Need
a
face
lift,
pretty
boy?
Back
off,
Peyton
-
We
need
him
Back
off!
This
is
what
I
think
is
happening.
This
guy
who
calls
So,
we're
working
for
the
Agency
-
Church
hired
us
to
take
out
the
General
but
the
He
used
to
be
with
the
Agency,
but
got
greedy,
And
that's
a
big
cash
plus.
But
Church
and
the
Agency
That
would
be
a
bad
head
line,
so
they
hire
us
to
kill
'em
Then
they're
back
in
business
And
we're
taken
out-
Is
it
still
5
million?
We'd
never
live
to
spend
it.
Sound
about
right?
It's
about
right
-
Where
is
he?
Who
the
hell
is
this?
Some
punk
Do
not
worry
about
it
We
got
your
back
If
he
comes
over
here
What
do
you
want?
Your
life
I
was
thinking
about
taking
it
-
But
I
don't
do
so
well
in
tight
spaces,
You
shouldn't
have
bruised
her
face
-
Would
have
like
to
have
kept
it
the
way
it
was
Well
keep
the
bitch
'cause
I'm
done
with
it
I'd
still
like
to
deflate
your
real
balls
Friend
Now
you
know
what
I
do
for
a
living
I'm
not
perfect,
but
you
should
have
waited
I
was
worth
it
So
your
daughter
paints
too
This
is
how
it
starts!
Let's
go,
there's
nothing
-
What's
the
matter,
Barney?
Don't
you
ever
sleep?
Nah.
What
happened
to
your
girlfriend?
Ha.
Another
one
bites
the
dust,
brother
I
was
going
to
paint
this
for
her
and
uh...
Then
I'm
just
gonna
smash
the
shit
out
of
it
Want
be
alone?
Not
really
On
the
island,
there
was
this
girl
Yep,
usually
are
Yeah
She
showed
us
around,
she
was
the
target's
daughter
When
she
had
a
chance
to
leave...
she
didn't
do
it
Ump,
she
had
some
guts
Why
can't
I
get
that
out
of
my
mind?
'Cause
she
stands
for
something
We
don't,
man,
we
don't
stand
for
shit.
That
dried
all
up
like
this
is
gonna
dry
all
up
It's
your
paint
is
gonna
dry
What
dried
up?
Just
belief.
Just
belief
in
the
soul.
Just...
I
don't
know,
the
human
parts,
brother.
You
remember
that
time
we
were
up
in
Bosnia?
We
took
down
them
Serb
bad
boys?
All
our
guys
were
gettin'
chopped
up
all
around
us
and...
there
was
blood
everywhere
I
never
thought
I
was
gonna
make
it
out
of
there,
and
you
didn't
either
-
Kinda
feelin'
like...dead
too,
ya
know?
My
head's
all
very,
very
black
place.
Just
goddamn
directly
to
black
I
remember
I
got
this
bottle
of
this
local
shit
they
have
And
I
ain't
feelin'
no
pain
now
...
and
I
come
up
on
this,
uh...
I
come
up
on
this
overland
bridge,
and
I
see
this
....
I
see
this
I
see
this
woman
standing
there,
ya
know?
I
stepped
out,
and
she
saw
me,
right
in
my
eyes.
And
I
was
lookin'
I
knew
what
she
was
going
to
do
She
looked
at
me,
and
I
knew
You
know
what
I
did,
man?
Until
I
heard
that
splash
And
she
was
gone.
after
taking
all
of
them
lives...
she
was
one
that...
I
could
have
saved
What
I
realized
later
on
was
uh...
if
I'd
have
saved
that
woman...
I
might
have
saved
what
was
A
wise
dead
man
once
told
me
that
a
real
man...
never
strikes
a
woman
You
push
some,
if
you
have
to
but
you
never
strike
It's
the
way
I
was
raised
This
man,
however,
....
This
man
...well
So
the
question
is,
Sandra...
Why
were
the
Americans
here?
Again
What
did
the
American
tell
you?
What
are
they
after?
Continue
I'm
going
back
to
Valiena
-
What
is
the
plan?
-
We
need
a
strategy
-
What?
-
Are
you
out
of

your
mind?
-
You
don't
owe
that
woman
nothing
-
If
you
want
to
kill
yourself,
fine.
Your
call
Listen,
I
don't
want
to
kill
myself.
I
gotta
do
this
Hey,
hey!-
Don't
lay
this
guilt
crap
on
us.
Hey,
this
is
my
choice,
there's
no
guilt
There's
no
guilt
Take
care
Yeah,
fuck
it,
his
choice
Yeah...
I
said
I'm
going
alone
I'm
going
too
Come
on,
Yang,
get
out
Just
drive
Do
not
lose
your
nerve
Don't
talk
to
me,
cockroach
Why
are
you
doing
this?
Friends
die
together
Hey!
Give
me
the
good
luck
ring.
Come
on
Don't
make
me
hurt
you,
Yang.
Come
on
Speed
better
than
luck
Whatever...
It's
difficult
What
is?
My
life
is
difficult.
I
need
more
money
Why's
that?
I
work
harder
than
the
rest
-
Yes
I
do
Because
they're
taller
When
I
get
hurt,
the
hole
is
bigger
Because
I'm
smaller
When
I
travel,
I
need
to
go
further
-
Yes
My
life
is
harder
than
you
think
I
need
more
money
I
know,
you
told
me
For
your
family,
right?
I
don't
have
family
I
know
Maybe
one
day
I
will
Get
out
there!
-
Because
you're
smaller
Oops
Do
that
again,
I'll
kill
ya!
Gunner!
Aww!
Beautiful!
That's
good
What
are
you
doin'?
Insects
Shit!
What
are
you
wearing?
Size
3?
My
turn!
Gunner!
Shit!
You
shot
me
Don't
say
that.
You
were
gonna
kill
him
I
was
just
gonna
scare
him
Don't
put
that
on
me,
you
never
liked
him
Am
I
dying?
Shot
you
a
couple
of
inches
above
your
heart
I'll
take
that
as
a
"yes"
Gunner,
who
sent
you?
Who
hired
you?
Who
cares?
Do
yourself
a
favor,
don't
let
go
until
you
That
better
make
me
right
You
got
it
Who
sent
you?
Who
sent
you?
Is
the
girl
still
alive?
-
You
know,
it's
not
easy
being
your
friend
That's
true
Man,
we'll
die
with
you.
I
know
the
lay
out.
What
the
hell
happened
to
you?
It's
too
sad
to
talk
about
it
Let's
fly
You
know,
the
enemy
will
Especially
shotguns
With
this
big
boy
spittin'
out
250
rounds
a
minute,
Absolutely
zero
So
let
me
get
this
right:
Gunner
tries
to
kill
you,
It
was
something
like
that
I
would
have
win
-
You
know
what?
I
trust
you
Want
you
to
meet
my
girlfriend

You
lost
me
there
When
Oomaya's
primer
strikes,
she
gets
off
And
when
that
happens,
anything
that
gets
in
my
And
if
that
doesn't
work...
Her
sister
will
You
should
meet
my
doctor
Too
late
It's
3:36.
We
have
20
minutes
to
take
this
We've
got
company
I've
got
him.
You
guys
take
off
Is
there
a
reason
you've
taken
the
soldiers
this
They
look
like
warriors
Warriors
loyal
to
me
I
thought
the
people
of
Valiena
hired
But
then
I
think,
maybe
this
is
your
plan
Because
you
can
not
control
me
And
torturing
Sandra
Works
for
you
You
want
to
kill
her
to
make
me
suffer
A
man
can
never
kill
a
child
But
you
can
Bring
Sandra
here
Bring
her
now
Or
I
will
kill
you
Go
get
her!
It's
me
It's
me
I
won't
hurt
you
How
are
you
here?
I
just
am
Can
you
move?
Yes
Ok
Time's
up.
Where's
Barney?

If
he's
not
come
in
10
minutes,
we're
gonna
This's
what
he
wants
-
Let's
go
Stop!
Don't!
No,
don't
kill
him!
It's
not
his
fight,
it's
mine!
-
Seal
the
building
Stand
him
up
If
you
didn't
have
this
kevlar
vest
your
insides
are
gonna
be
like
fuckin'
mush
Well
ain't
that
a
shame?
You
know
you're
a
lucky
man
Well,
I
ain't
feelin'
lucky,
man
You
are
a
lucky
man
He
told
me
to
keep
you
conscious
Did
he?
Alright.
First...

a
real
tough
guy,
aren't
you?
What?

Look

me

piece
of
trash

men

got?
Just

is
your
last
time
You

me
the
right
answer
I'll
cut
you
a
break
You
give
me
the
wrong
answer
you
will
die
Yes

breathe
Loosen

you?
Your

Everything
bad
that
has
happened

Take

you.
I'm
not
goin'
anywhere

You
can't
succeed
without
me
I
am
the
leader!
You're
a
puppet
in
a
hat!
Shut
up!
-
NOW!
Get
back!


Shit's
gettin'
old!
Your
lucky
ring
stinks
I
know
Let's

-
The
Agency's
parasites
hired
you,
didn't
they?
I'd
have
paid
you
twice
as
much...
You
have
to
think
I'm
pretty
freakin'
Why
would
I
do
that?
I
created
this
I
made
it
all
happen
And
they
wanted
me
out.
Why?
Stop
walking
And
what
about
me
and
you?
We
both
the
same...
we're
both
mercenaries
We're
both
dead
inside
Why
the
hell
did
you
come
after
me?
I
didn't
come
after
you,
dipshit.
I
came
for
her
Call
it
a
tie
Yeah,
I
guess
so
You're
not
as
fast
as
you
think
I'm
beginning
to
sense
that
Same
account
number
as
mine.
