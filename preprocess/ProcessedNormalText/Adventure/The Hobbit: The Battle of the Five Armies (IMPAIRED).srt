And

bargain?

You
call

fair
trade?

honor
such
terms?
Because
you
gave
us
your
word.

that
mean
nothing?
Be
gone!
Ere

arrows...

cannot

one
thing.

Aye.

worth
more

done,

Yes.
Sorry...

that.
I
came...
...to
give
you...

The
Heart
of
the

The
King's
Jewel.
And
worth
a

ransom.
How
is
this...

no

I'm
not
doing
it
for

They're
suspicious
and

...with
the
worst

loyal

I've
grown...

this

for

as

Imagine
what

I'm
not
afraid
of

Well,

BILBO:
The

I
gave
it

You?
I
took
it
as
my

No,

No!

See

He's
