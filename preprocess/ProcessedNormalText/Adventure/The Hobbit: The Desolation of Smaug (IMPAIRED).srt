MAN
1:
I'm
dying
of
thirst
over
here.
-
Here
you
are.

BETSY:
Oh,
watch
it!
-
There
you
are.
MAN
4:
GANDALF:
I'll
have
the
same.
I
should
introduce
myself.
Gandalf
the
Grey.
I
know
who
you
are.
Well,
now.
This
is
a
fine
chance.
What
brings
Thorin
Oakenshield
to
Bree?
I
received
word
that
my
father...
...had
been
seen
wandering...
...the
Wilds
near
Dunland.
I
went
looking.
I
found
no
sign
of
him.
Thorin,
it's
been
a
long
time...
...since
anything
but
rumor
was
heard...
...of
Thrain.
He
still
lives.
I
am
sure
of
it.
My
father
came
to
see
you
What
did
you
say
to
him?
I
urged
him
to
march
upon
Erebor,
...the
seven
armies
of
the
Dwarves...
...to
destroy
the
dragon
and
take
back...
...the
Lonely
Mountain.
And
I
would
say
the
same
to
you.
Take
back
your
homeland.
This
is
no
chance
meeting,
No.
It
is
not.
The
Lonely
Mountain
troubles
me...
...Thorin.
That
dragon
Sooner
or
later...
...darker
minds
will
turn
towards
Erebor.
I
ran
into
some
unsavory
characters...
...whilst
traveling
on
the
Greenway.
They
mistook
me
for
a
vagabond.
I
imagine
they
regretted
that.
GANDALF:
It
is
Black
Speech.
A
promise
of
payment.
For
what?
Your
head.
Someone
wants
you
dead.
Thorin,
you
can
wait
no
longer.
...the
heir
to
the
Throne
of
Durin.
Unite
the
armies
of
the
Dwarves.
Together,
you
have
the
might
and
power...
...to
retake
Erebor.
Summon
a
meeting
Demand
they
stand
by
their
oath.
The
seven
armies
swore
that
oath
The
Arkenstone.
It
is
the
only
thing
that
will...
...unite
them,
...that
jewel
was
stolen
by
Smaug.
What
if
I
were
to
help
you
reclaim
it?
How?
The
Arkenstone
lies
half
a
world
away...
...buried
beneath
the
feet
Yes,
it
does.
Which
is
why
we're
going
to
need
a
burglar.




THORIN:
Too
close.
A
couple
of
leagues,
no
more.
-
Have
the
Wargs
picked
up
our
scent?
-
We
have
another
problem.
They
saw
you.
No,
that's
not
it.
What
did
I
tell
you?
Quiet
as
a
mouse.

Excellent
burglar
material.
Will
you
listen?
Will
you
just...
...listen?
I'm
trying
to
tell
you
What
form
did
it
take'?
Like
a
bear?
Ye--
Yes,
but
bigger.
Much
bigger.
You
knew
about
this
beast?
I
say
we
double
back.
THORIN:
There
is
a
house...
...it's
not
far
from
here,
Whose
house?
Are
they
friend
or
foe?
Neither.
He
will
help
us
or...
...he
Will
kill
us.
What
choice
do
we
have?

None.
GANDALF:


This
way!
Quickly!
THORIN:
Bombur,
come
on!
GANDALF:
Run!
Come
on,
get
inside.
Open
the
door!
Quickly!

DORI:
Push!
THORIN:
DWALIN:
ORI:
...that?
That
is
our
host.
His
name
is
Beorn.
And
he's
a
skin-changer.
Sometimes
he's
a
huge
black
bear.
Sometimes
he's
a
great
strong
man.
The
bear
is
unpredictable...
...but
the
man
can
be
reasoned
with.
...he
is
not
overfond
of
Dwarves.

He's
leaving.
Come
away
from
there.
It's
not
natural.
None
of
it.
It's
obvious.
He's
under
some...
...dark
spell.
GANDALF:
He's
under
no
enchantment
but
his
own.
All
right,
now
get
some
sleep.
All
of
you.
You'll
be
safe
here
tonight.

I
hope.

How?

Now

You

Yes.
You

lies
upon

Fell

There
is
an

the

I

not

in
great

We
will
take

Elven

That

still
safe.
BEORN:
The

They're

it

not.
What

And
you
are

You
will
never

I
don't

They're

Blind

did.

could

pack
on
our
tail.
BALIN:
To
the
mountain.
We're
so
close.
A
lake
lies
between
us
and
that
mountain.
-
We
have
no
way
to
cross
it.
The
Orcs
will
run
us
down,
We've
no
weapons
to
defend
ourselves.
Bind
his
leg,
quickly.
You
have
two
minutes.
BARD:
...and
you're
dead.
BALIN:
...but
you're
from
Lake-town,
That
barge
over
there...
...it
wouldn't
be
available
for
hire,
What
makes
you
think
I
would
help
you?
Those
boots
have
seen
better
days.
As
has
that
coat.
No
doubt
you
have
How
many
bairns?
A
boy
and
two
girls.
And
your
wife,
I
imagine
she's
a
beauty.
BARD:
She
was.
I'm
sorry.
I
didn't
mean
to--
Oh,
come
on,
come
on.
What's
your
hurry?
What's
it
to
you?
I
would
like
to
know
who
you
are...
...and
what
you
are
doing
in
these
lands.
We
are
simple
merchants
...journeying
to
see
our
kin...
...in
the
Iron
Hills.
Simple
merchants,
you
say?
We
need
food...
...supplies,
weapons.
Can
you
help
us?
BARD:
...barrels
came
from.
What
of
it'?
I
don't
know
what
business
you
had
...but
I
don't
think
it
ended
well.
No
one
enters
Lake-town...
...but
by
leave
of
the
Master.
All
his
wealth
comes
from
trade
He
would
see
you
in
irons
before
Offer
him
more.
BALIN:
...ways
to
enter
that
town
unseen.
Aye.
But
for
that...
...you
would
need
a
smuggler.
For
which
we
would
pay
double.

THRANDUIL:
Such
is
the
nature
of
evil.
...the
vast
ignorance
of
the
world...
...it
festers
and
spreads.
A
shadow
that
grows
in
the
dark.
A
sleepless
malice
as
black...
...as
the
oncoming
wall
of
night.
So
it
ever
was.
So
will
it
always
be.
In
time,
all
foul
things
come
forth.

Why?

Not
anymore.
The
young
one...
...the
black-haired
archer...
...we
stuck
him
with
a
Morgul
shaft.
The
poison's
in
his
blood.
He'll
be...
...choking
on
it
soon.
Answer
the
question,
filth.

I
would
not
antagonize
her.
You
like
killing
things,
Orc?
You
like
death?
Then
let
me
give
it
to
you.
THRANDUIL
:


...dead
Dwarf.
Answer
the
question.
You
have
nothing
to
fear.
Tell
us...
...what
you
know
LEGOLAS:
What
is
Thorin
Oakenshield
to
you?

LEGOLAS:
There
is
no
King
Under
the
Mountain,
None
would
dare
enter
Erebor...
...whilst
the
dragon
lives.
You
know
nothing.
Your
world
will
burn.
LEGOLAS:
Speak!
Our
time
has
come
again.
My
master
serves
the
One.
Do
you
understand
now,
Elf
ling?
Death
is
upon
you.
The
flames
of
war...
...are
upon
you.
Why
did
you
do
that?
You
promised
to
set
him
free.
And
I
did.
I
freed
his
wretched
head
LEGOLAS:
...the
Orc
could
tell
us.
There
was
nothing
more
he
could
tell
me.
What
did
he
mean
by
"the
flames
of
war"?
It
means
they
intend
to
...it
will
destroy
all
before
it.
I
want
the
watch
doubled
at
our
borders.
Nothing
moves,
but
I
hear
of
it.
No
one
enters
this
kingdom.
And
no
one
leaves
it.
LEGOLAS
:
ELROS
:
ELROS:


Watch
out!
THORIN:
...to
do,
drown
us?
I
was
born
and
bred
on
these
waters,
If
I
wanted
to
drown
you...
...I
would
not
do
it
here.
Oh,
I've
had
enough
of
this
lippy
Lakeman.
I
say
we
throw
him
over
the
side
-
Bard,
his
name's
Bard.
Uh,
I
asked
him.
I
don't
care
what
he
calls
himself.
BALIN:
We
simply
have
to
pay
him.
Come
on
now,
lads.
Turn
out...
...your
pockets.
How
do
we
know
he
won't
betray
us?
We
don't.
BALIN:
...just
a
wee
problem.
We're
10
coins
short.
Gloin.
Come
on.
-
Give
us
what
you
have.
I
have
been
bled
dry...
...by
this
venture.
What
have
I
seen...
...for
my
investment?
Naught
but
misery
and...
...grief
and--
GLOIN:
Take
it.
-
Take
all
of
it.
The
money,
quick.
Give
it
to
me.
THORIN:
...get
our
provisions
but
not
before.
If
you
value
your
freedom,
There
are
guards
ahead.

What's
he
doing?
BILBO:
He's
pointing
right
at
us.
Now
they're...
...shaking
hands.
-
What?
He's
selling
us
out.




BARD:
We're
approaching
the
tollgate.
PERCY:
Goods
inspection!
Papers,
please!
Oh,
it's
you,
Bard.
Morning,
Percy.
Anything
to
declare?
Nothing,
but
that
I
am
cold
and
tired...
...and
ready
for
home.
You
and
me
both.
There
we
are.
All
in
order.
Not
so
fast.
"Consignment
of
empty
barrels
Only...
...they're
not
empty...
...are
they,
Bard?
If
I
recall
correctly...
...you're
licensed
as
a
bargeman.
Not...
...a
fisherman.
That's
none
of
your
business.
Wrong.
It's
the
Master's
business,
Oh,
come
on,
Alfrid,
have
a
heart.
These
fish
are
illegal.
Empty
the
barrels...
-...over
the
side.
Come
on.
Get
a
move
on.
Folk
in
this
town
are
struggling.
Times
are
hard.
Food
is
scarce.
That's
not
my
problem.
BARD:
And
when
the
people
hear
...back
in
the
lake...
...when
the
rioting
starts...
...will
it
be
your
problem
then?
Stop.
Ever
the
people's
champion...
...eh,
Bard?
Protector
of...
...the
common
folk.
You
might
have
their
favor
now,
...but
it
won't
last.
Raise
the
gate!
The
Master
has
his
eye
on
you.
You'd
do
well
to
remember:
We
know
where
you
live.
It's
a
small
town,
Alfrid.
Everyone
knows
where
everyone
lives.

ALFRID:
Someone's
been
stirring
the
pot,
sire.

Gout
playing
up,
sire?
It's
the
damp.
It's
the
only
possible
explanation.
Get
me
a
brandy.
The
mood
of
the
people,
sire,
They're
commoners,
Alfrid.
It's
not
my
fault
they
live
in
a
place...
...that
stinks
of
fish
oil
and
tar.
Jobs,
shelter,
food.
It's
all
they
ever
bleat
about.
It's
my
belief,
sire,
they
are
MASTER".
...troublemakers
and
arrest
them.
My
thoughts
exactly,
sire.
MASTER:
And
all
this
talk
of
change
Can't
afford
to
let
the
rabble
...and
start
making
noises.
...you
know,
they'll
start
...forming
committees...
...launching
inquiries.
Out
with
the
old,
in
with
the
new?
What?
That's
what
they've
been
saying,
sire.
There
is
even
talk...
...of
an
election.
An
election?
Heh.
That's
absurd.
I
won't
stand
for
it.
Ha!
I
don't
think
they'd
ask
you
to
stand,
sire.
Shirkers.
Ingrates.
Rabble-rousers.
Who
would
have
the
nerve
Who
would
dare?
Who--?
Bard.
You
mark
my
words:
That
trouble-making
bargeman...
...is
behind
all
this.

Get
your
hands
off
me.
BARD:
You
didn't
see
them.
The
fish
you
can
have
for
nothing.
Follow
me.
BAIN:
Our
house,
it's
being
watched.

BARD:
You
can
tell
the
Master
...for
the
day.
Da!
Where
have
you
been?
Father!
There
you
are!
I
was
worried.
Here,
Sigrid.
Bah,
get
them
'm.
If
you
speak
of
this
to
anyone...
...I'll
rip
your
arms
off.
Get
off.
Up
there.
SIGRID:
...why
are
there
Dwarves
Will
they
bring
us
luck?
They
may
not
be
the
best
fit...
...but
they'll
keep
you
warm.
Thank
you
very
much.
A
Dwarvish
windlance.
BILBO:
...you've
seen
a
ghost.
He
has.
The
last
time
we
saw...
...such
a
weapon...
...a
city
was
on
fire.
It
was
the
day
the
dragon
came.

The
day
that
Smaug...
...destroyed
Dale.
Girion,
the
Lord
of
the
City...
...rallied
his
bowmen...
...to
fire
upon
the
beast.
But
a
dragon's
hide
is
tough.
Tougher
than
the
strongest
armor.
Only
a
Black
Arrow
fired
from
a
windlance...
...could
have
pierced
the
dragon's
hide.
And
few
of
those...
...arrows
were
ever
made.
The
store
was
running
low...
...when
Girion...
...made
his
last
stand.
Had
the
aim
of
Men
been
true
that
day...
...much
would
have
been
different.
You
speak
as
if
you
were
there.
All
Dwarves
know
the
tale.
Then
you
would
know
He
loosened
a
scale
under
the
left
wing.
One
more
shot
and

That's
a
fairy
story,
lad.
Nothing
more.
You
took
our
money.
Where
are
the
weapons?
Wait
here.
THORIN:
...the
last
days
of
autumn.
Durin's
Day
falls
the
morn
after
next.
We
must
reach
the
mountain
before
then.
And
if
we
do
not?
If
we
fail
to
find
the
hidden
door
Then
this
quest
has
been
for
nothing.

What
is
this?
Pike
hook.
Made
from
an
old
harpoon.
-
And
this?
Fashioned
from
a
smithy's
hammer.
It's
heavy
in
hand,
I
grant...
...but
in
defense
of
your
life,
We
paid...
...you
for
weapons.
Iron-forged
swords...
...and
axes!
It's
a
joke!
BARD:
...better
outside
the
city
armory.
All
iron-forged
weapons
are
held
there...
...under
lock
and
key.
BALIN:
...why
not
take
what's...
...on
offer
and
go?
I've
made
do
with
less.
So
have
you.
-
I
say
we
leave
now.
What
did
you
say?
There
are
spies
watching
this
house...
...and
probably
every
dock
You
must
wait...
...till
nightfall.
Thorin.
Da?
Don't
let
them
leave.

30

your

You

I
would
come.
The

angry...

For
600
years...
...my
father
has
protected
you,
You
defied
his
orders.
You
betrayed
his
trust.



...roam
our
lands.
Yet
he
would
let
this
Orc
pack
cross

It
is
our
fight.
It
will
not
end
here.
With
every
victory,
this
evil
will
grow.
If
your
father
has
his
way,
We
will
hide
within
our
walls...
...live
our
lives
away
from
the
light...
...and
let
darkness
descend.
Are
we
not
part
of
this
world?
Tell
me,
mellon.
When
did
we
let
evil
Hello,
Bard.
What
you
after?
BARD:
An
old
one!
Where's
it
gone?
What
tapestry
you
talking
about?
This
one.
HILDA:
They
were
Dwarves,
I
tell
you.
...out
of
nowhere.
Full
beards.
Fierce
eyes.
I've
never
seen
the
like.
What
are
Dwarves
doing
in
these
parts?
-It's
the
prophecy.
MAN

Prophecy.
Prophecy.
The
old
tales
will
come
true.
Vast
halls
of
treasure!
Can
it
really
be
true?
Has
the
lord
of
silver
fountains
returned?
The
lord
of

The

come
into

At
the

return
But
all
shall
fail
in
sadness
And
the

will
shine
and
burn
Da,
I
tried
to
stop
them.
How
long
have
they
been
gone?
BILBO:
Can
you
see
anything?
THORIN
:
As
soon
as
we
have
the
GO,
go!
DORI
:
Next.
You
all
right?
I
can
manage.
Let's
just
get
out
of
here.



Run!
GLOIN:


Get
off
me!
Get
off!
GUARD:
BRAGA:
What
is
the
meaning
of
this?
BRAGA:
We
caught
them
stealing
weapons,
sire.
Enemies
of
the
state,
eh?
ALFRID:
...mercenaries,
if
ever
there
was,
sire.
Hold
your
tongue!
You
do
not
know
to
whom
you
speak.
This
is
no
common
criminal.
This
is
Thorin...
...son
of
Thrain,
son
of
Thror!

We
are
the
Dwarves
of
Erebor.
We
have
come
to
reclaim
our
homeland.
I
remember
this
town
Fleets
of
boats
lay
at
harbor...
...filled
with
silks
and
fine
gems.
This
was
no
forsaken
town
on
a
lake.
This
was
the
center
of
all
trade
I
would...
...see
those
days
return.
I
would
relight
the
great
forges
...and
send
wealth
and
riches...
...flowing
once
more

BARD:
That
is
what
you
will...
...bring
upon
us!
Dragon
fire
and
ruin.
If
you
waken
that
beast...
...it
will
destroy
us
all.
THORIN:
...but
I
promise
you
this:
If
we
succeed...
...all
will
share
in
the
wealth

You
will
have
enough
gold
...10
times
over!

All
of
you!
Listen
to
me!
You
must
listen!
Have
you
forgotten
Have
you
forgotten
those...
...who
died
in
the
firestorm?!
And
for
what
purpose?
The
blind
ambition
of
a
Mountain
King...
...so
riven
by
greed,
he
could
not...
...see
beyond
his
own
desire!
MASTER:
We
must
not,
any
of
us...
...be
too
quick
to
lay
blame.
Let
us...
...not
forget
that
it
was...
...Girion,
Lord
of
Dale...
...your
ancestor...
...who
failed
to
kill
the
beast!
ALFRID:
We
all
know
the
story.
Arrow
after
arrow,
he
shot.
Each
one
missing
its
mark.
You
have
no
right.
No
right
to
enter
that
mountain.
I
have
the
only
right.
I
speak
to
the
Master...
...of
the
Men
of
the
Lake.
Will
you
see
the
prophecy
fulfilled?
Will
you...
...share
in
the
great
wealth
What
say
you?
I
say
unto
you...
Welcome!
Welcome!
And
thrice...
...welcome...
...King
Under
the
Mountain!
BILBO:
You
do
know
we're
one
short.
-
If
he's
not
here,
we
leave
him
behind.
If
we're
to
find
the
door
before...
...nightfall,
we
can
risk
no
more
delays.
Not
you.
We
must
travel
at
speed.
What
are
you
talking
about?
Not
now.
I'm
going
to
be
there
When
we
first
look
upon
Kili,
stay
here.
Rest.
Join
us
when
you're
healed.
OIN:
My
duty
lies
with
the
wounded.
Uncle.
We
grew
up
on
tales
of
the
mountain.
Tales
you
told
us.
You
cannot
take
that
away...
-...from
him!
I
will
carry
him
if
I
must!
One
day
you
will
be
king
I
cannot
risk
the
fate
of
this
quest
Not
even
my
own
kin.
Fili,
don't
be
a
fool.
You
belong
with
the
company.
I
belong
with
my
brother.


By
my
beard,
is
that
the
time?!
Ah!
MASTER:
...and
good
wishes.
-
And
may
your
return
bring
good
fortune...
...to
all!

Good
bye.
BOFUR:
No!
No!
Ha.
So
you
missed
the
boat
as
well?
Kili?
Kili!

No.
I'm
done
with
Dwarves.
Go
away.
No,
no...
...no!
Please!
No
one
will
help
us.
Kilt's
sick.
He's
very
sick.
BILBO:
BALIN:
Now
it
is
a
ruin.
The
desolation
of
Smaug.
The
sun
will
soon
reach
midday.
We
must
find
the
hidden
door
This
way.
Wait.
Is
this
the
overlook?
Gandalf
said
to
meet
him
here.
-
On
no
account
were
we
to--
We
have
no
time...
...to
wait
upon
the
Wizard.
We're
on
our
own.
Come!
Dol
Guldur.
The
Hill
of
Sorcery.
It
looks
completely
abandoned.
As
it
is
meant
to.
A
spell
of
concealment...
...lies
over
this
place,
which
means...
...our
Enemy
is
not
yet
ready
He
has
not
regained
his
full
strength.
Radagast,
I
need
you
to
carry
Tell
her
we
must
force
his
hand.
RADAGAST:
I'm
going
in
alone.
On
no
account
come
after
me.
Do
I
have
your
word?
Yes,
yes,
yes!
RADAGAST:
What
if
it's
a
trap?!
Turn
around
and
do
not
come
back.
It's
undoubtedly
a
trap.

THORIN:
The

door.
Let
all
those
who
doubted
us...
...rue
this
day!

Right,
then.
We
have
a
key.
Which
means
that
somewhere...
...there
is
a
key-hole.
THORIN:
...will
shine
upon...
...the
key-hole."
Nori.

We're
losing
the
light.
Come
on.
NORI:
I
can't
find
it.
It's
not
here!
It's
not
here!
THORIN:
Break
it
down!
Come
on!
DWALIN:
It
has
to
break.
BALIN:
The
door's
sealed.
Can't
be
opened
by
force.
There's
a
powerful
magic
on
it.
No!
"The
last
light
of
Durin's
Day...
...will
shine
upon
the
key-hole."
That
is
what
it
says.
What
did
we
miss?
What
did
we
miss?
Balin?
We've
lost
the
light.
There's
no
more
to
be
done.
We
had
but...
...one
chance.
Come
away,
lads.
It's
over.
-
Wait
a
minute.
BILBO:
You
can't
give
up
now!
Thorin.
You
can't
give
up
now.
"Stand
by
the
gray
stone...
...when
the
thrush
knocks."
The
setting
sun.
And
"the
last
light
of
Durin's
Day
The
last
light.
Last
light.

The
last
light!
The
key-hole!
Come
back!
Come
back!
It's
the
light
of
the
moon!
The
last...
...moon
of
autumn!
Ha,
ha,
ha!
Where's
the
key?
Where's
the
key?
It
was
here.
Come
on,
it
was--
It
was
here.
It
was
just--

Erebor.
Thorin.
I
know
these
walls.
These
halls.
This
stone.
You
remember
it...
...Balin.
Chambers
filled
with
golden
light.
I
remember.
"Herein
lies...
...the
Seventh
Kingdom
of...
...Durin's
Folk.
May
the
Heart
of
the
Mountain
...Dwarves
in
defense
of
this
home."
The
Throne
of
the
King.
Ah.
And
what's
that
above
it?
The
Arkenstone.
Arkenstone.
And
what's
that?
That,
Master
Burglar...
...is
why
you
are
here.

Can
you
not
do
something?
I
need
herbs.
I
have
nightshade.
I
have
feverfew.
They're
no
use
to
me.
No,
it's
a
weed.
We
feed
it
to
the
pigs.
Pigs?
Weed.
Right.
Don't
move.
You
want
me
to
find
a
jewel?
A
large,
white
jewel.
Yes.
That's
it?
Only,
I
imagine
There
is
only
one
Arkenstone...
...and
you'll
know
it
when
you
see
it.
Right.
In
truth...
...lad...
...I
do
not
know...
...what
you
will
find
down
there.
You
needn't
go
if
you
don't
want
to.
No,
Balin.
I
promised
I
would
do
this...
...and
I
think
I
must
try.

It
never
ceases
to
amaze
me.
What's
that?
The
courage
of
Hobbits.
Go
now...
...with
as
much
luck
as
you
can
muster.
Oh,
Bilbo?
If
there
is,
in
fact...
...a
live
dragon...
...down
there...
...don't
waken
it.





GANDALF
:

Where
is
he?!
AZOG:


NECROMANCER:

Sauron!




Not
at
home.
Ahem.
Good.
Good,
good,
good.
What's
that?
Shush.Shush.
Arkenstone.
Arkenstone.
A
large,
white
jewel.
Very
helpful.


Well...
...thief.
I
smell
you.
I
hear
your
breath.
I
feel...
...your
air.
Where
are
you?
Where
are
you?
Come,
now...
...don't
be
shy.
Step
into
the
light.
Hmm.
There
is
something
about
you.
Something
you...
...carry.
Something
made
of
gold.
But
far
more...
...precious.
VOICE
OF
THE
RING:
There
you
are...
...Thief
in
the...
...Shadows.
I
did
not
come
to
steal
from
you...
...O
Smaug...
...the
Unassessably
Wealthy.
...to
gaze
upon
your
magnificence.
To
see...
...if
you
really
were
as
great
I
did
not
believe
them.
And
do
you
now'?!
Truly...
...the
tales
and
songs...
...fall
utterly
short
of
your
enormity...
...O
Smaug
the
Stupendous.
Do
you
think
flattery
will
keep
you
alive?
No,
no.
No,
indeed.
You
seem
familiar
with
my
name...
...but
I
don't
remember
smelling
Who
are
you...
...and
where
do
you
come
from...
...may
I
ask?
I
come
from
under
the
hill.
Underhill?
BILBO:
...and
over
hills
my
path
has
led.
And--
And...
...through
the
air.
Impressive.
What
else
do
you
claim
to
be?
I
am--
Luck-wearer.
Riddle-maker.
Lovely
titles.
Go
on.
Barrel-rider.
Barrels?
Now
that
is
interesting.
And
what
about...
...your
little
Dwarf
friends?
Where
are
they
hiding?
Dwarves?
No.
No,
no.
No
Dwarves
here.
You've
got
that
all
wrong.
Oh,
I
don't
think
so,
Barrel-rider!
They
sent
you
in
here...
...to
do
their
dirty
work
while
they...
...skulk
about
outside.
Truly...
...you
are
mistaken...
...O
Smaug,
Chiefest
You
have
nice
manners...
...for
a
thief
and...
...a
liar!
I
know
the
smell
and
taste
of
Dwarf.
No
one
better!
It
is
the
gold!
They
are
drawn...
...to
treasure
like...
...flies
to
dead
flesh.
Did
you
think
I
did
not
know...
...this
day
would
come?!
That
a
pack
of...
...canting
Dwarves...
...would
come
crawling
back...
...to
the
mountain?!


DORI:
That,
my
lad...
...was
a
dragon.


SIGRID:
It's
coming
from
the
mountain.
You
should
leave
us.
Take
your
children.
Get
out
of
here.
And
go
where?
There
is
nowhere
to
go.
Are
we
going
to
die,
Da?
No,
darling.
TILDA:
It's
going
to
kill
us.
Not
if
I
kill
it
first.
The
King
Under
the
Mountain
is
dead.
I
took
his
throne.
I
ate
his...
...people
like
a
wolf
among
sheep.
I
kill
where...
...I
wish,
when...
...I
Wish.
My
armor
is
iron.
No
blade
can
pierce
me.
All
right.
A
Black
Arrow?
Why
did
you
never
tell
me'?
Because
you
did
not
need
to
know.

Listen
to
me
carefully.
I
need
you
to
distract
the
guards.
Once
I'm
at
the
top
of...
...the
tower,
I'll
set
the
arrow
to
the
bow.
BRAGA:
Bard!
-
After
him!
BRAGA:
GUARD
1:
Stop!
BARD:
Keep
it
safe.
Don't
let
anyone
find
it.
-
I'm
not
leaving
you.
Braga.
You're
under
arrest.
-
On
what
charge?
GUARD
2:
What
about
Bilbo?
Give
him
more
time.
Time
to
do
what?
To
be
killed?
You're
afraid.
Yes,
I'm
afraid.
I
fear
for
you.
A
sickness
lies
upon
that
treasure
hoard.
A
sickness
which
drove...
...your
grandfather
mad.
I
am
not
my
grandfather.
You're
not
yourself.
The
Thorin
I
know
would
not
hesitate
THORIN:
...this
quest
for
the
life
of
one
burglar.
Bilbo.
His
name
is
Bilbo.
It's
Oakenshield...
...that
filthy
Dwarvish
usurper.
He
sent
you
in
here...
...for
the
Arkenstone,
didn't
he?
No.
No...
...no.
I
don't
know
Don't
bother
denying
it.
I
guessed
his
foul
purpose
But
it
matters
not.
Oakenshield's
quest
will
fail.
The
darkness
is
coming.
It
will
spread
to
every
corner
of
the
land.




SMAUG:
...in
the
Shadows.
...ever
a
means
to
an
end.
The
coward...
...Oakenshield
has
weighed...
...the
value
of
your
life...
...and
found
it
worth
nothing.
No.
No.
No,
you're
lying.
What
did
he
promise
you?
A
share
of
the
treasure?
As
if
it
was
his...
...to
give.
I
will
not
part
with...
...a
single
coin.
Not
one
piece
of
it.
My
teeth...
...are
swords.
My
claws
are
spears.
My
Wings...
...are
a
hurricane.
So
it
is
true.
The
Black
Arrow
found
its
mark.
What
did
you
say?
I
was
just
saying
your
reputation
...the
Tyrannical.
Truly.
You
have
no
equal
on
this
earth.
I
am...
...almost
tempted
to
let
you
take
it.
If
only
to
see
Oakenshield...
...suffer.
Watch
it...
...destroy
him.
Watch
it
corrupt
his
heart...
...and
drive
him
mad.
But
I
think
not.
I
think
our
little
game
ends
here.
So
tell
me...
...thief...
...how
do
you
choose
to
die?


Nah.

SIGRID:



-
Aah!



Get
down!

FIMBUL:
You
killed
them
all.
LEGOLAS:
Tauriel.
Come.

We're
losing
him.
Tauriel.

Athens
.
Athens
.
What
are
you
doing?
I'm
going
to
save
him.

-
You're
alive!
-
Did
you
find
the
Arkenstone?
The
Arkenstone.
Did
you
find
it?
We
have
to
get
out.
Thorin.
Thorin.


SMAUG:
-Run!
DORI:

Come
on.

Hold
him
down.

Unh!
Tilda.
Shh,
Shh,
Shh!
We've
given
him
the
slip.
No.
He's
too
cunning
for
that.
So
where
to
now?
The
western
guardroom.
There
may
be
a
way
out.
It's
too
high.
There's
no
chance...
-...that
way.
We
have
to
try.
Come
on.

I've
heard
tell
of
That
was
a
privilege
to
witness.
Tauriel.
Lie
still.
You
cannot
be
her.
She
is
far
away.
She
is
far...
...far
away
from
me.
She
walks...
...in
starlight
in
another
world.
It
was
just
a
dream.
Do
you
think
she
could've
loved
me?
THORIN:
DWALIN:
There's
no
way
out.
BALIN:
They
must
have
come
here...
...hoping...
...beyond
hope.
We
could
try
to
reach
the
mines.
We
might
last
a
few
days.
No.
I
will
not
die
like
this.
Cowering.
Clawing
for
breath.
We
make
for
the
forges.
He'll
see
us,
sure
as
death.
Not
if
we
split
up.
BALIN:
...we'll
never
make
it.
THORIN:
Lead
him
to
the
forges.
We
kill
the
dragon.
If
this
is
to
end
in
fire...
...then
we
will
all
burn
together.
This
way.

SMAUG:
Flee.
Run
for
your
lives.
There
is...
...nowhere
to
hide.
ORI:
DORI:
Come
on!
Run!
DWALIN:
Here!





This
way.
It's
this
way!
Come
on!
Thofin!
Follow
Balin!
-
Thorin.

Thofin!
DWALIN:

NORI:
Go.
Go!
DWALIN:
The
plan's
not
gonna
work.
BALIN:
...fire
hot
enough
to
set
them
ablaze.

Have
we
not?
I
did
not
look
to
see
you
so
easily
outwitted.
You
have
grown...
...slow
and
fat...
...in
your
dotage...
...slug!
Take
cover.
Go!
THORIN:
Get
those
bellows
working.
Go!
THORIN:
Up
there.
On
my
mark...
...pull
that
lever.
Balin!
Can
you
still
mix
a
flash-flame?
Aye.
It'll
only
take
a
jiffy.
Come
on!
We
don't
have
a
jiffy.
BALIN:
DORY.
...you're
doing?
BALIN:
NOW!



Lead
him
to
the
Gallery
of
the
Kings.

Keep
going,
Bilbo!
Run!
You
think
you...
...can
deceive
me,
Barrel-rider?
You
have
come
from
Lake-town.
This
is
some...
...sordid
scheme
hatched
between
...and
those
miserable
Those
sniveling
cowards...
...with
their
long
bows...
...and
Black
Arrows.
Perhaps
it
is
time...
...I
paid
them
a
visit.
Oh,
no.
This
isn't
their
fault!
Wait!
You
cannot
go
to
Lake-town!
You
care
about
them...
you?
Good.
Then
you
can...
...watch
them
die.
THORIN:
You
witless
worm.
You.
I
am
taking
back
what
you
stole.
SMAUG:
...will
take
nothing...
...from
me...
...Dwarf.
I
laid
low
your
warriors...
...of
old.
I
instilled
terror
in...
...the
hearts
of
Men.
I
am...
...King
Under...
...the
Mountain.
THORIN:
These
are
Dwarf
lands.
This
is
Dwarf
gold.
And
we
will...
...have
our
revenge.


SMAUG:

Revenge?!
I
will
show
you
revenge!

Listen
to
me!
Do
you
not
know
what
is
coming?
I
am
fire.
I
am...
...death.
What
have
we
done?
