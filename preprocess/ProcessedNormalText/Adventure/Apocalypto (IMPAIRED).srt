The
heart...
...for
Smoke
Frog.
Thank
you.
This
liver
for
Curl
Nose.

Thank
you.
Cocoa
Leaf...
...the
ears.
Thank
you.
And
for
you
Blunted...
...the
balls.
Not
this
again.
I'm
helping
you.
Then
you
eat
them!
I
don't
need
them.
Do
you
fellows?

No.
Of
course
not!
Sometimes!
What
do
you
think?
No!
No,
no!
But
how
many
times
does
it
take?
I
have
eight
older
sisters
Father
took
tapir
balls
all
ten
times.
Shall
I
tell
him?
I'm
sorry.
The
balls
are
useless.
You've
never
had
them?
Couldn't
tell
you
what
they
taste
like.
None
of
you?
No,
but
it's
been
fun
watching
you...
This
was
your
idea!
Get
him
off
me!
-

Calm
down!
Why
do
you
let
them
treat
you
like
this?
Be
strong.
Where
is
your
pride?
It
all
works...
Yes?
Yes...
...I
just
can't
make
children.
There
is
something
I
will
tell
you...
...but
I
warn
you,
it's
very
powerful.
What
do
you
speak
of?
The
soanzo
leaf.
The
soanzo
leaf?
From
the
great
marshes
in
the
south...
This
is
what
gave
me
my
ten
children.
No!
No!
Wait...
You
have
to
rub
them
on...
down
there.
Just
before
you
next
try.
Apply
it
generously...
I
don't
know
how
to
thank
you.
If
this
works...
Your
wife?
No,
her
mother.
The
old
hag
wants
grandchildren.
Give
me
some
meat.
Here,
work
on
this...
...pure
meat...
...ball
breath.

What
do
you
want?
What
do
you
want?

I
am
Flint
Sky.
I
have
hunted
My
father
hunted
this
forest
Jaguar
Paw,
my
son.
He
hunts
this
forest
with
me.
He
will
hunt
it
with
his
son
A
good
catch?
Good
waters
here.
The
forest
gives
much
here.
We
ask
only
to
pass
through.
Pass.
Keep
safe
as
you
pass.
Let's
go.
-

Our
lands
were
ravaged.
We
seek
a
new
beginning.
Your
lands
were
ravaged?
Yes...
We
seek
a
new
beginning...
Be
still.
My
son!
Be
still.
Back
to
the
village.


I
ask
you
not
to
speak
You
are
troubled.
Yes,
I
am.

Those
people
in
the
forest,
I
do
not
understand.
Fear.
Deep
rotting
fear.
They
were
infected
by
it.
Did
you
see?
Fear
is
a
sickness.
It
will
crawl
into
the
soul
It
has
tainted
your
peace
already.
I
did
not
raise
you
Strike
it
from
your
heart.
Do
not
bring
it
into
our
village.
At
first
light
...at
the
sacred
hill
of
our
fathers.
There
we
will
call
on


Oh,
here
he
is!
The
big
lump!
He's
useless.
He
can't
do
it.

You!
Yes
you!
With
your
height
and
your
girth.
Get
inside!
Damn
you!
Get
in
there!
Old
woman,
please.
Move
it!
You
don't
work!
What
are
you
laughing
about?
Give
me
a
grandchild
Mother,
that's
enough.
Do
not
come
out
until
you
make
a
child.
Two
would
be
better!
What?
Twins
you
oaf.
Mother.
Can
you
go
away?
Just
get
busy.
Mom...
She's
gone.

Mother,
what
do
you
say
we
should
I
have
tapir...

I
say
boy.
Roasted!
The
tapir
smells
better.
No
Dad!
No!
It's
me!
It's
me!
I'll
just
hang
the
boy
here
Wait...
That's
our
Turtles
Run.
Yes
it's
me.
It's
your
eldest!
In
that
case,
a
crush
for
my
eldest...
...and
a
crush
for
my
youngest.

Tapir
it
is.



One
day,
old
man!
One
day
you
won't
be
able

And
a
Man
sat
alone.
Drenched
deep
in
sadness.
And
all
the
animals
"We
do
not
like
to
see
you
so
sad...
"Ask
us
for
whatever
you
wish
The
Man
said:
The
vulture
replied:
The
Man
said:
"I
want
to
be
strong."
The
jaguar
said:
"You
shall
be
strong
like
me."
Then
the
Man
said:
"I
long
The
serpent
replied:
And
so
it
went
with
all
the
animals.
And
when
the
Man
had
...he
left.
Then
the
owl
said
to
the
other
animals:
"Now
the
Man
knows
much
"Suddenly
I
am
afraid."
The
deer
said:
"Now
his
sadness
will
stop."
But
the
owl
replied:
"No."
"I
saw
a
hole
in
the
Man...
"Deep
like
a
hunger
"It
is
what
makes
him
sad
"He
will
go
on
taking
and
taking...
"Until
one
day
the
World
will
say:
"I
am
no
more


Come
back
to
me...
Come
back
to
me.
My
son
is
dancing.
Your
son
is
happy.


What
do
you
want?

Run!

Now
that
you're
up,
The
dog.


Get
up!
Get
up!
Now!

-



Go
to
the
forest.
Run!
Do
not
look
back.

No!
No!
I
am
afraid!
Look
into
my
eyes.
Look
into
my
eyes.
Be
strong...
I
am
afraid!
Be
strong.
-


Tie
him
up!

Father!
The
others.
I
have
to
help.
No,
don't
leave
us!
I
will
come
back,
I
promise.
Don't
you
leave!
I
promise.
Stay,
please
stay.
Father,
don't
go.


-


-

Very
nice.
Stop!
Tie
him
up!
I
want
him
alive.
Sorry
Father.
That's
enough!
Stand
him
up.
Move
away.
My
son.
Don't
be
afraid.

Almost...

...that's
your
name.
"Almost".


Our
life
is
over.
Shame...
Shame!
Cowards!



-

Let's
move!




We
move
out
now.
They
are
back.
Get
up!
Heave!
Cut
Rock,
you
forgot
to
duck.
Hold
still.
Can
you
see?
Yes.
Get
back
to
your
line.
-


Come
with
us...

Get
up.
Leave
him
alone,
"Almost".
I
said
get
up.
-

Up,
up...
...that's
it.
Let's
go!
This
man
is
a
good
friend
of
yours...


Don't
worry...
I'll
take
care
of
them.
They
are
mine
now.
Gentle
Ixchel.
Tender
mother
of
mercy.
Keep
them
from
harm.
Please.
Keep
them.

One
more.
Ready?



Hold
on!
Hold
on!
Wait...
...let's
see
what
happens.
That's
it!
Hurry!
Pull!
Be
strong!
Yes!
You
did
it!

Good
work!
Can
you
breathe...?
Good.


Wait
here.
What's
become
of
my
capture?
Dead
weight.
He
nearly
took
the
rest
with
him.
I
let
him
go.
You.
Let
him
go?
Shall
we
now
do
what
you
want?
Let
us
try
that.

Don't
let
any
others
go.
Let's
move.


Get
up
"Almost".
We
don't
want
to
lose
you
just
yet.


Stand
up,
boy.
You
proved
yourself
today,
my
son.
You're
now
worthy
to
stand
Thank
you
Father.
Take
it...
...it's
yours.
It
has
taken
many
lives.
Get
some
rest.
Resting
brothers...
...fathers,
mothers,
wives.
You
felt
the
cold
Now
you
cannot
feel
She
stopped
screaming...
...too
long
before
they
returned,
We
saw
how
she
fought
them.
But
in
the
final
moment?
If
she
let
them...
...the
Goddess
of
the
Scaffold
Her
soul
waits
for
yours
I
need
to
know.
Before
this
day's
end
I
will
take
as
many
And
I
will
gladly
embrace
...if
I
do
not
find
my
Sky
Flower
there.

Don't
rain.
-


I
am
walking
here.

Keep
away,
she
has
the
sickness.

Get
back!
-

You
fear
me?
So
you
should...
...all
you
who
are
vile.
Would
you
like
to
know
how
you
will
die?
The
sacred
time
is
near...
Beware
the
blackness
of
day.
Beware
the
man
who
brings
the
jaguar.
Behold
him
reborn
from
mud
and
earth...
For
the
one
he
takes
you
to
...and
scratch
out
the
earth.
Scratch
you
out.
And
end
your
world.
He's
with
us
now.
...day
will
be
like
night.
And
the
man
jaguar

Where
are
they
taking
us?
We
tell
stories
of
a
place
stone-built.
What
happens
there?
I
do
not
know...
...but
the
earth
bleeds.
We
are
near.
Salvation!
He
has
the
laughing
sickness.
He
likes
you!
Help
me!
Save
me.
Die
like
a
man.



Welcome
back.
Have
you
been
successful?
Ask
my
son.
How
many
captives?
Deal
with
my
son.
A
fair
price.
As
always,
trust
me.
Good.

How
much
will
you
give
me?



Who
will
buy
this
woman?
No...
she's
too
old.
She
can
be
useful.
She
can
cook...
clean...
Useless
old
woman!
No
sale.
Go!
Go
on.
