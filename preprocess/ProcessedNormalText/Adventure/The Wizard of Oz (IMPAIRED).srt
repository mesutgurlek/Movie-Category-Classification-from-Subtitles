"I've
been
mad
for
fucking
years,
absolutely
years,
been
over
the
edge
for
yonks,
been
working
me
buns
off
for
bands..."
"I've
always
been
mad,
I
know
I've
been
mad,
like
the
most
of
us...very
hard
to
explain
why
you're
mad,
even
if
you're
not
mad..."

Breathe,
breathe
in
the
air.
Don't
be
afraid
to
care.
Leave
but
don't
leave
me.
Look
around
and
choose
your
own
ground.
Long
you
live
and
high
you
fly
And
smiles
you'll
give
and
tears
you'll
cry
And
all
you
touch
and
all
you
see
Is
all
your
life
will
ever
be.
Run,
rabbit
run.
Dig
that
hole,
forget
the
sun,
And
when
at
last
the
work
is
done
Don't
sit
down
it's
time
to
dig
another
one.
For
long
you
live
and
high
you
fly
But
only
if
you
ride
the
tide
And
balanced
on
the
biggest
wave
You
race
towards
an
early
grave.


"Live
for
today,
gone
tomorrow,
that's
me,
HaHaHaaaaaa!"

Ticking
away
the
moments
that
make
up
a
dull
day
You
fritter
and
waste
the
hours
in
an
offhand
way.
Kicking
around
on
a
piece
of
ground
in
your
home
town
Waiting
for
someone
or
something
to
show
you
the
way.
Tired
of
lying
in
the
sunshine
staying
home
to
watch
the
rain.
You
are
young
and
life
is
long
and
there
is
time
to
kill
today.
And
then
one
day
you
find
ten
years
have
got
behind
you.
No
one
told
you
when
to
run,
you
missed
the
starting
gun.
So
you
run
and
you
run
to
catch
up
with
the
sun
but
it's
sinking
Racing
around
to
come
up
behind
you
again.
The
sun
is
the
same
in
a
relative
way
but
you're
older,
Shorter
of
breath
and
one
day
closer
to
death.
Every
year
is
getting
shorter
never
seem
to
find
the
time.
Plans
that
either
come
to
nought
or
half
a
page
of
scribbled
lines
Hanging
on
in
quiet
desparation
is
the
English
way
The
time
is
gone,
the
song
is
over,
Thought
I'd
something
more
to
say.
Home,
home
again.
I
like
to
be
here
when
I
can.
When
I
come
home
cold
and
tired
It's
good
to
warm
my
bones
beside
the
fire.
Far
away
across
the
field
The
tolling
of
the
iron
bell
Calls
the
faithful
to
their
knees
To
hear
the
softly
spoken
magic
spells.

"And
I
am
not
frightened
of
dying,
any
time
will
do,
I
don't
mind.
Why
should
I
be
frightened
of
dying?
There's
no
reason
for
it,
you've
gotta
go
sometime."
"I
never
said
I
was
frightened
of
dying."

Money,
get
away.
Get
a
good
job
with
good
pay
and
you're
okay.
Money,
it's
a
gas.
Grab
that
cash
with
both
hands
and
make
a
stash.
New
car,
caviar,
four
star
daydream,
Think
I'll
buy
me
a
football
team.
Money,
get
back.
I'm
all
right
Jack
keep
your
hands
off
of
my
stack.
Money,
it's
a
hit.
Don't
give
me
that
do
goody
good
bullshit.
I'm
in
the
high-fidelity
first
class
travelling
set
And
I
think
I
need
a
Lear
jet.
Money,
it's
a
crime.
Share
it
fairly
but
don't
take
a
slice
of
my
pie.
Money,
so
they
say
Is
the
root
of
all
evil
today.
But
if
you
ask
for
a
raise
it's
no
surprise
that
they're
giving
none
away.
"HuHuh!
I
was
in
the
right!"
"Yes,
absolutely
in
the
right!"
"I
certainly
was
in
the
right!"
"You
was
definitely
in
the
right.
That
geezer
was
cruising
for
a
bruising!"
"Yeah!"
"Why
does
anyone
do
anything?"
"I
don't
know,
I
was
really
drunk
at
the
time!"
"I
was
just
telling
him,
he
couldn't
get
into
number
2.
He
was
asking
why
he
wasn't
coming
up
on
freely,
after
I
was
yelling
and
screaming
and
telling
him
why
he
wasn't
coming
up
on
freely.
It
came
as
a
heavy
blow,
but
we
sorted
the
matter
out"

Us,
and
them
And
after
all
we're
only
ordinary
men.
Me,
and
you.
God
only
knows
it's
noz
what
we
would
choose
to
do.
Forward
he
cried
from
the
rear
and
the
front
rank
died.
And
the
general
sat
and
the
lines
on
the
map
moved
from
side
to
side.
Black
and
blue
And
who
knows
which
is
which
and
who
is
who.
Up
and
down.
But
in
the
end
it's
only
round
and
round.
Haven't
you
heard
it's
a
battle
of
words
The
poster
bearer
cried.
Listen
son,
said
the
man
with
the
gun
There's
room
for
you
inside.
"I
mean,
they're
not
gunna
kill
ya,
so
if
you
give
'em
a
quick
short,
sharp,
shock,
they
won't
do
it
again.
Dig
it?
I
mean
he
get
off
lightly,
'cos
I
would've
given
him
a
thrashing
-
I
only
hit
him
once!
It
was
only
a
difference
of
opinion,
but
really...I
mean
good
manners
don't
cost
nothing
do
they,
eh?"
Down
and
out
It
can't
be
helped
but
there's
a
lot
of
it
about.
With,
without.
And
who'll
deny
it's
what
the
fighting's
all
about?
Out
of
the
way,
it's
a
busy
day
I've
got
things
on
my
mind.
For
the
want
of
the
price
of
tea
and
a
slice
The
old
man
died.


The
lunatic
is
on
the
grass.
The
lunatic
is
on
the
grass.
Remembering
games
and
daisy
chains
and
laughs.
Got
to
keep
the
loonies
on
the
path.
The
lunatic
is
in
the
hall.
The
lunatics
are
in
my
hall.
The
paper
holds
their
folded
faces
to
the
floor
And
every
day
the
paper
boy
brings
more.
And
if
the
dam
breaks
open
many
years
too
soon
And
if
there
is
no
room
upon
the
hill
And
if
your
head
explodes
with
dark
forebodings
too
I'll
see
you
on
the
dark
side
of
the
moon.
The
lunatic
is
in
my
head.
The
lunatic
is
in
my
head
You
raise
the
blade,
you
make
the
change
You
re-arrange
me
'till
I'm
sane.
You
lock
the
door
And
throw
away
the
key
There's
someone
in
my
head
but
it's
not
me.
And
if
the
cloud
bursts,
thunder
in
your
ear
You
shout
and
no
one
seems
to
hear.
And
if
the
band
you're
in
starts
playing
different
tunes
I'll
see
you
on
the
dark
side
of
the
moon.
"I
can't
think
of
anything
to
say
except...
I
think
it's
marvellous!
HaHaHa!"

All
that
you
touch
All
that
you
see
All
that
you
taste
All
you
feel.
All
that
you
love
All
that
you
hate
All
you
distrust
All
you
save.
All
that
you
give
All
that
you
deal
All
that
you
buy,
beg,
borrow
or
steal.
All
you
create
All
you
destroy
All
that
you
do
All
that
you
say.
All
that
you
eat
everyone
you
meet
All
that
you
slight
everyone
you
fight.
All
that
is
now
All
that
is
gone
All
that's
to
come
and
everything
under
the
sun
is
in
tune
but
the
sun
is
eclipsed
by
the
moon.

"I've

town
Waiting
for
someone
or
something
to
show
you
the
way.
Tired
of
lying
in
the
sunshine
staying
home
to
watch
the
rain.
You
are
young
and
life
is
long
and
there
is
time
to
kill
today.
And
then
one
day
you
find
ten
years
have
got
behind
you.
No
one
told
you
when
to
run,
you
missed
the
starting
gun.
So
you
run
and
you
run
to
catch
up
with
the
sun
but
it's
sinking
Racing
around
to
come
up
behind
you
again.
The
sun
is
the
same
in
a
relative
way
but
you're
older,
Shorter
of
breath
and
one
day
closer
to
death.
Every
year
is
getting
shorter
never
seem
to
find
the
time.
Plans
that
either
come
to
nought
or
half
a
page
of
scribbled
lines
Hanging
on
in
quiet
desparation
is
the
English
way
The
time
is
gone,
the
song
is
over,
Thought
I'd
something
more
to
say.
Home,
home
again.
I
like
to
be
here
when
I
can.
When
I
come
home
cold
and
tired
It's
good
to
warm
my
bones
beside
the
fire.
Far
away
across
the
field
The
tolling
of
the
iron
bell
Calls
the
faithful
to
their
knees
To
hear
the
softly
spoken
magic
spells.

"And
I
am
not
frightened
of
dying,
any
time
will
do,
I
don't
mind.
Why
should
I
be
frightened
of
dying?
There's
no
reason
for
it,
you've
gotta
go
sometime."
