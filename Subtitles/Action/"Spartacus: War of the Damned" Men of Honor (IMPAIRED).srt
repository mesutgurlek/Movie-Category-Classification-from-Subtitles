00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:55,795
A Roman that shall
never raise hand against us.

173
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:59,799
I have never held love
for any of such name,

174
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:00,967
Yet he held no threat --

175
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:04,637
Men such as him hold the greatest.

176
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,806
True intent, shrouded behind mask

177
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:08,808
of kind and gentle face.

178
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,577
Have you known his reflection?

179
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:19,018
Before I came to the mines of Lucania.

180
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:25,825
This one carried gentle name of Herius.

181
00:11:28,095 --> 00:11:29,296
Husband.

182
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:30,764
Father of two young daughters.

183
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:32,265
He saw me fed.

184
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,533
Bathed.

185
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:34,734
Allowed me to feel safe

186
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:36,136
for the first time since being turned

187
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:39,840
from the House of Batiatus.

188
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,275
When his family took to sleep,
he came to me.

189
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,014
Lifting me in his arms.

190
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:54,790
I thought it a dream at first.

191
00:11:54,857 --> 00:11:58,594
There was a place,

192
00:11:58,662 --> 00:12:03,132
removed from the grounds of his villa,

193
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,503
where wagons were crafted and repaired.

194
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:14,911
He applied his many tools inside me.

195
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:17,147
[ screaming ]

196
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,617
Before turning them to outward flesh.

197
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,958
I wish I had power to seize memory,

198
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:34,663
and with hands strip it from life.

199
00:12:34,731 --> 00:12:37,667
It is not the one that shadows mind.

200
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:41,438
What I saw in morning light,

201
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:43,573
forever darkens thought.

202
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:46,376
The man himself,

203
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:52,449
greeting his wife with
kiss and warm smile.

204
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:57,488
His daughters laughing upon his knee.

205
00:12:57,555 --> 00:13:01,692
The beast from
the previous night transformed,

206
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:08,265
into a man who held no threat.

207
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:12,402
I have no words.

208
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,140
You do not need them.

209
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:19,275
Knowing, you are at my side

210
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:21,144
gives comfort enough.

211
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:23,112
I will always stand so.

212
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,426
All the fucking stalls
bear same misfortune.

213
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:38,394
And of the remainder?

214
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:39,662
How long will it see us fed?

215
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,863
Two weeks.

216
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:41,964
Perhaps more, if we're cautious

217
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:43,866
and our numbers do not swell.

218
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:46,769
Fuck the gods.

219
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:48,737
Spartacus.

220
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:50,239
Ships weigh anchor off our coast.

221
00:13:57,348 --> 00:14:00,751
It seems we have drawn notice.

222
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:02,686
Sanus.

223
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:04,188
What do your eyes fall upon?

224
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:06,624
Four men approach.
Armed.

225
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:08,893
One with cask perched atop shoulder.

226
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,927
Romans?

227
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:12,496
Not fucking likely, by appearance.

228
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,400
Raise the gate.

229
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:32,516
What shit is this?

230
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:34,584
Brigands of Cilicia.

231
00:14:34,652 --> 00:14:36,119
Pirates?

232
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:39,722
I would speak with the man

233
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,591
that has claimed this city.

234
00:14:45,028 --> 00:14:47,629
Your words fall upon his ear.

235
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,168
What business do you break?

236
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:54,937
You are Spartacus?

237
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:57,540
I stand so named.

238
00:14:57,607 --> 00:14:58,741
The same fiend that brought down

239
00:14:58,808 --> 00:15:00,643
the arena in Capua?

240
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,879
Defeated Glaber at Vesuvius?

241
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:06,515
Wrought untold suffering

242
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,051
upon the Republic and its people.

243
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:11,887
All deeds claimed with pride.

244
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,497
Then I call you fucking brother!

245
00:15:27,737 --> 00:15:30,606
Let us share gift of wine,

246
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:33,709
and break words towards common enemy!

247
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:52,528
Gaius!

248
00:15:52,596 --> 00:15:54,363
It has been too many years.

249
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:56,199
They have been
unkind to you, old friend.

250
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,266
[ laughing ]

251
00:15:57,334 --> 00:16:00,103
At least I do not
stand woolly fucking goat!

252
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,538
Crassus denies me sharpened blade.

253
00:16:02,606 --> 00:16:04,173
Under what purpose?

254
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,175
A personal matter,

255
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:08,911
concerning only those
within his confidence.

256
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:11,981
Regrettably none stand so here.

257
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:13,083
You have received message

258
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,585
in advance of our arrival, Mummius?

259
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:18,255
We stand ready to march
upon your command.

260
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:21,192
<i>Have use of my tent until such a time.</i>

261
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:22,293
Come!

262
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:24,595
I would leave these boys
to their plotting

263
00:16:24,663 --> 00:16:27,698
and hear of your
adventures with Antonius.

264
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:31,636
Impudent shit.

265
00:16:31,704 --> 00:16:33,071
He brushes you aside in favor

266
00:16:33,138 --> 00:16:35,807
of swallowing Caesar's cock.

267
00:16:35,874 --> 00:16:37,975
Let us pray he chokes upon it.

268
00:16:40,512 --> 00:16:41,412
Adherbal!

269
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,314
Break open cask so we may share drink.

270
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:44,916
I would break words in advance.

271
00:16:44,984 --> 00:16:46,885
While mind is yet unclouded.

272
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:48,887
Heracleo is your guest,

273
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:50,655
and I am at your will.

274
00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:52,690
It is an honor for me
to be across from the man

275
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:54,926
who steals an entire fucking city!

276
00:16:54,993 --> 00:16:58,329
It was the fucking Romans
who stole freedom from us.

277
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:00,631
We merely seize what is owed.

278
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:02,299
I favor turn of your reason,

279
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,101
brothers.

280
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:07,071
Some Romans yet live within Sinuessa?

281
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:08,105
A few.

282
00:17:08,173 --> 00:17:09,640
The Aedile among them?

283
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:16,080
He does not.

284
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,081
You are sure of this?

285
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:18,849
His villa now stands ours.

286
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:21,385
His claim to it severed by my own hand.

287
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:23,120
Then I too have been injured.

288
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:27,825
This man speaks in fucking riddles.

289
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:29,026
<i>Hmm.</i>

290
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:33,265
Straighten tongue,

291
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:37,103
or fall from presence.

292
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,540
The Aedile and I had an arrangement.

293
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,542
He brokered such with men
of your calling?

294
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:47,614
Openly, no.

295
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:50,583
Yet many things are
born of dark corners.

296
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:52,118
The seas are fraught with dangers...

297
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:54,086
especially for those who,

298
00:17:54,154 --> 00:17:57,823
consider themselves his competitor.

299
00:17:57,891 --> 00:17:59,992
In return for your "services"?

300
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:04,764
Knowledge of time and route
of unfortunate vessels.

301
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:07,700
All goods aboard, added to my own,

302
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:10,636
with the seal of the Aedile

303
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:12,872
pressed upon new manifest.

304
00:18:14,741 --> 00:18:16,375
What cause does thief upon wave

305
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:18,243
<i>need of parchment and seal?</i>

306
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:22,814
<i>The official seal removes</i>
<i>unwanted attention when</i>

307
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:26,384
trading acquisitions in respected ports.

308
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:29,488
Advantage snatched from hand,

309
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:32,825
by fucking action of your own.

310
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:34,761
<i>To shit with this grinning cunt.</i>

311
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:35,796
Agron.

312
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:37,998
What threat does he hold?

313
00:18:38,065 --> 00:18:40,166
Pissing on us from the sea?

314
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:41,167
You would be surprised

315
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:43,503
by the reach of my stream, boy.

316
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:46,573
Let's us take breath then,

317
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,309
remove ourselves from heated words.

318
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:51,811
There is yet drink to be had.

319
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:54,547
Return when sun gives way to moon.

320
00:18:54,615 --> 00:18:58,485
And discover if there
stands cause to share cup.

321
00:18:58,552 --> 00:19:02,489
As you command, King Spartacus.

322
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:03,824
As you command.

323
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,067
The man swings cock
to rival Jupiter himself.

324
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:17,771
Close gate upon ass,
and be done with him.

325
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:20,607
He may yet be of use.

326
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:22,509
Find Aedile's seal,

327
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:25,045
and let us weigh advantage it brings.

328
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:26,713
<i>Cilicians!</i>

329
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:29,283
Shit rises to fill mouth.

330
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,119
Have you laid eyes upon it or not?

331
00:19:32,186 --> 00:19:35,823
I forge steel,
not trade at fucking ports.

332
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,125
What need would I have of Aedile's seal?

333
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:39,927
Words I would have greeted sooner.

334
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:41,962
Is that what it was like,

335
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,030
before you gained your freedom?

336
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:46,800
Were you made to fight
as an animal would,

337
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:49,169
as you made poor Ulpianus?

338
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:50,637
I prompted no contest.

339
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:52,505
Yet you did not stop it.

340
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:54,574
What fate did you believe

341
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:56,509
when deciding to aid in taking the city?

342
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:58,178
I held no fucking choice.

343
00:19:58,245 --> 00:20:00,914
Every man holds such at time's end.

344
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:03,884
You hold no love
for these people, Attius.

345
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,186
Do not now raise vaunted concerns now.

346
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:07,754
"These people."

347
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:10,057
Am I not Roman, as they were?

348
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:14,328
As some yet are?

349
00:20:14,395 --> 00:20:16,930
You stand for yourself alone.

350
00:20:16,998 --> 00:20:20,534
As I once stood.

351
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:22,236
You are proof then.

352
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,305
That basest clay

353
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:27,408
may yet be molded into
something of worth.

354
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:32,447
Turn from past,

355
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:34,716
set eye toward new horizon,

356
00:20:34,783 --> 00:20:37,118
far from this place
and the man that you were.

357
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:57,671
Praise fucking gods,
I've found men of worth.

358
00:20:57,738 --> 00:21:00,106
What crude form do you deposit at feet?

359
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:01,508
Sinuessa.

360
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:04,911
Spartacus has taken Sinuessa en Valle.

361
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:07,147
Summon Mummius.

362
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:08,281
Wine.

363
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:13,086
Gratitude.

364
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:15,488
Repay favor with gift of words.

365
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:17,124
I have few of note.

366
00:21:17,191 --> 00:21:19,193
We thought the gate secure.

367
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,462
Yet Spartacus is of the underworld,

368
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,965
able to spirit himself
through wood and stone.

369
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,466
He is but a man.

370
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,836
I've laid eyes upon him.

371
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:29,237
Bathed in blood and gore.

372
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:31,406
The city trembling in his wake.

373
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:33,308
Spartacus is no man.

374
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,709
He's the Bringer of Death.

375
00:21:34,777 --> 00:21:38,613
And yet you live.

376
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:40,148
Your skill in combat must equal

377
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,417
that of the legend himself.

378
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:43,718
I was paid but a few coin

379
00:21:43,786 --> 00:21:45,187
by the Aedile to aid in curfew.

380
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:46,121
I'm no soldier.

381
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:47,756
Put such question aside.

382
00:21:47,824 --> 00:21:50,158
How many men does Spartacus now hold?

383
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,593
I do not know.

384
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:53,195
<i>The streets were filled with them,</i>

385
00:21:53,263 --> 00:21:55,364
slaughtering all in their path.

386
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:56,364
I barely made escape

387
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:58,199
to the bay before they took the docks.

388
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,668
Now it becomes clear.

389
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,336
<i>In place of falling a hero,</i>

390
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,205
you chose to flee.

391
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:06,473
And fall a coward.

392
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:13,281
Have you lost mind?

393
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:15,684
The man held no worth,
by his own tongue.

394
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,920
You are not in fucking command.

395
00:22:20,723 --> 00:22:22,290
Apologies.

396
00:22:22,358 --> 00:22:23,391
I slip from reason...

397
00:22:23,459 --> 00:22:25,694
when presented with
the faults of lesser men.

398
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,798
Let us see body removed,
and discuss--

399
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:33,969
The time for words has ended.

400
00:22:34,037 --> 00:22:35,137
Break camp,

401
00:22:35,205 --> 00:22:37,239
and return to my father
with news of Spartacus.

402
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:41,444
He gave order to remain at your side.

403
00:22:41,512 --> 00:22:43,980
I am the word and the will

404
00:22:44,048 --> 00:22:46,316
of Marcus Crassus.

405
00:22:46,384 --> 00:22:49,553
You are not at my side, Gaius.

406
00:22:49,621 --> 00:22:50,888
You serve beneath me.

407
00:22:56,928 --> 00:22:58,429
I fall to command.

408
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:05,536
Gather what remains of your men.

409
00:23:05,604 --> 00:23:07,638
We move for Sinuessa en Valle.

410
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:31,094
Leave us.

411
00:23:37,368 --> 00:23:40,336
This stood my home.

412
00:23:40,404 --> 00:23:42,171
No longer.

413
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:51,147
I will not beg for my life.

414
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:52,948
I do not seek it.

415
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:56,352
Only your aid.

416
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,523
You rob me of my husband.

417
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:03,292
Lay waste to my city.

418
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,094
And now you call upon fucking aid?

419
00:24:05,162 --> 00:24:07,096
We are at war.

420
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:09,566
You and your people stand casualty.

421
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:13,403
My own ranks question sparing
a few that yet draw breath.

422
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,106
I give chance to prove wisdom of it.

423
00:24:17,174 --> 00:24:18,307
So we may live out our days

424
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:21,677
as party favors for
your fucking amusement?

425
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:24,714
As word carries of Ulpianus?

426
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:26,882
Ulpianus?

427
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,718
Your men made him fight
for crust of bread.

428
00:24:29,786 --> 00:24:32,187
And claimed hand even
though he stood victor.

429
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:33,822
A thing I did not know of.

430
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,257
<i>It shall not pass again.</i>

431
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:42,430
I took belief in your
reassurance once before.

432
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:43,765
And now stand widow for it.

433
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,400
I do not turn from what I have done.

434
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:47,569
He was an honorable man!

435
00:24:47,636 --> 00:24:49,838
Forever stricken from this world by you!

436
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,466
You elevate the dead beyond their worth.

437
00:24:51,507 --> 00:24:54,643
You did not know him.

438
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:58,347
Nor I fear did you.

439
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:01,551
The name Heracleo holds meaning?

440
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:05,121
A plague upon the sea.

441
00:25:05,189 --> 00:25:07,825
My husband devoted
much coin toward his capture.

442
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:09,460
He devoted greater sum,

443
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:11,896
towards secret pact.

444
00:25:11,964 --> 00:25:13,231
You lie.

445
00:25:13,298 --> 00:25:15,833
Your husband provided seal of office

446
00:25:15,901 --> 00:25:19,270
in exchange for
dispatching of his rivals.

447
00:25:19,338 --> 00:25:21,239
Presented to me by Heracleo himself.

448
00:25:31,016 --> 00:25:32,416
Know that I do not take pleasure

449
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:34,352
in staining cherished memory.

450
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:35,553
You tear world from grasp,

451
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,088
and whisper of kindness.

452
00:25:37,155 --> 00:25:40,424
I whisper of opportunity.

453
00:25:40,492 --> 00:25:42,993
Heracleo seeks the Aedile's seal.

454
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:44,495
With it I will forge trade

455
00:25:44,563 --> 00:25:46,364
that will see us fed.

456
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:48,933
It eludes discovery.

457
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,669
You know of the seal's location?

458
00:25:52,737 --> 00:25:54,004
Ennius feared rebellion,

459
00:25:54,072 --> 00:25:56,940
and took measure
to protect what was his.

460
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:59,209
There are many places hidden to eye

461
00:25:59,277 --> 00:26:01,779
among his holdings throughout the city.

462
00:26:01,846 --> 00:26:03,580
Aid in revealing them,

463
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,415
and you and your people will share equal

464
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:10,887
portion from what we gain
in bargain with the Cilician.

465
00:26:10,954 --> 00:26:12,856
I would have freedom as price.

466
00:26:12,923 --> 00:26:16,526
For all of us.

467
00:26:16,594 --> 00:26:19,597
Do this thing,

468
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:20,431
and you will be released,

469
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:23,334
when we take leave of Sinuessa.

470
00:26:23,402 --> 00:26:25,770
Am I to trust your word?

471
00:26:25,838 --> 00:26:28,340
The reason is simple.

472
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:32,777
You stand absent choice.

473
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:45,022
Hidden within blushed eye,
the guardian spirits.

474
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:48,191
Is it a wonder the gods
turned on your husband

475
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:49,459
and this fucking city?

476
00:26:49,527 --> 00:26:50,860
Let us turn from past

477
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:52,696
and set gaze towards favored bargain.

478
00:26:52,763 --> 00:26:54,431
And fall to much needed drink!

479
00:26:58,036 --> 00:26:59,569
How much would you have for it?

480
00:26:59,637 --> 00:27:01,972
I ask for nothing.

481
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,673
Upon our abandoning the city,

482
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:05,308
the seal is yours.

483
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:07,477
And until such fated day?

484
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:09,412
An agreement of trade.

485
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,681
Coin for food.

486
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:14,284
First shipment from what stores
you have aboard your ships.

487
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:20,191
You would entreat Poseidon

488
00:27:20,258 --> 00:27:22,927
to shun robes and present ass!

489
00:27:22,994 --> 00:27:24,595
If he stood before me.

490
00:27:24,663 --> 00:27:27,398
Yet he does not.

491
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:30,768
My supplies are of finest quality.

492
00:27:30,836 --> 00:27:32,270
Eighteen thousand denarii

493
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:34,505
easily fetched if sold at port.

494
00:27:34,573 --> 00:27:36,074
Absent the Aedile's seal?

495
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:43,282
You are not the man one expects.

496
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,117
Hmm.

497
00:27:49,356 --> 00:27:51,524
Ten thousand denarii.

498
00:27:51,591 --> 00:27:53,592
If Aedile's wife is added
to the bargain huh.

499
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,496
You mistake me for a Roman.

500
00:27:56,563 --> 00:27:58,097
I do not trade in slaves.

501
00:28:02,002 --> 00:28:03,903
Nor would I, if possessed with such

502
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:06,839
a ripe cunt.

503
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:15,649
Twelve thousand denarii.

504
00:28:15,716 --> 00:28:17,784
In hour before sun's rising,

505
00:28:17,852 --> 00:28:20,787
upon landing beyond city walls.

506
00:28:20,855 --> 00:28:21,888
Beyond the city?

507
00:28:21,956 --> 00:28:24,090
Ground absent advantage, brother.

508
00:28:24,158 --> 00:28:26,660
I would not sail into port,
only to be set upon.

509
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:33,100
