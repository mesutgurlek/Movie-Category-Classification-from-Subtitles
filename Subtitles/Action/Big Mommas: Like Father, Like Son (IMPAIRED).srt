00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,387
They haven't called in yet and you
have no idea where they are.

322
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,014
You're the FBI!

323
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,100
What good is a leak if you can't tell me anything?

324
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,144
Just send me the photo.

325
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,646
How's the leg, boss? The leg's fine!

326
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,486
The FBI's run travel records, rental cars. Nothing.

327
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,156
They haven't left the area, at least not yet.

328
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,992
What about the flash drive?

329
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,494
Turner knows where it is.

330
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,038
We find Turner, we find the flash drive.

331
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,582
Right now, our biggest problem's his kid.

332
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,709
He saw me shoot Canetti.

333
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,836
I want him dead.

334
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,468
I got 15 MP3s of original stuff that ain't been mixed.

335
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,969
You can have that.

336
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,848
Georgia Girls School for the Arts.

337
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,226
You know what, just do like Pac's mom did.

338
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,435
After I'm shot down in the streets,

339
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,853
just release it as a double jam.

340
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,148
Would you knock off the crazy talk?
We gonna get out of this.

341
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,235
Yeah. That's probably what Biggie thought

342
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,861
when he was staring down the barrel.

343
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,906
Or Pac, when he was chilling on the Strip.

344
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,952
I got a plan.

345
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,453
You know what? Malcolm,

346
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,955
just promise me one thing.

347
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,081
What?

348
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,041
Don't let them do a clean version for Walmart.

349
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,794
Preserve who the Prodi-G was.

350
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,587
I'm going to hide you.

351
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,880
Hide?

352
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,510
I mean, come on. How you gonna
hide a swag as big as this?

353
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,097
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

354
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,816
I'm gonna need a shrink after this, you realize that?

355
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,776
You didn't seem to mind when you was little and

356
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,111
I caught you trying on your mother's...

357
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,237
Shh!

358
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,865
You promised never to bring that
up. I was putting on a play.

359
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,199
(IN WOMANLY VOICE) Lord, Lord!

360
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,202
You a difficult child, Charmaine Daisy Pierce.

361
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,037
Who are you talking about?

362
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,164
(IN NORMAL VOICE) My great-niece.

363
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,540
And you better start sounding like her

364
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,624
before you scare someone.

365
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,168
Oh, right. (CHUCKLES)

366
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,669
In that case, how's this?

367
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,838
(SINGING IN LOW VOICE) Swing low, sweet...

368
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,464
(SQUEALING)

369
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,800
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Holy mother of...

370
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,846
Yeah. Yeah, right there. Now remember that feeling.

371
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,601
Fine! If I gotta be a chick, can I at least be a cute one?

372
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,437
Next time I'll buy my own damn clothes!

373
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,398
(IN WOMANLY VOICE) And pull down that skirt!

374
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,442
I can see straight to the Promised Land.

375
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,444
It's pulled down!

376
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,782
After a while, you realize it's just not worth the fight.

377
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,327
I wasn't even talking to you.

378
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,787
Nosy and all in my business!

379
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,581
Wait up!

380
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,213
(WOMAN SINGING) You think you might
have a chance I don't think so

381
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,591
You telling me to be nice I don't think so

382
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,761
You wanna get in my pants I don't think so

383
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,471
(TRENT GRUNTING)

384
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,312
I don't think so

385
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,563
I don't understand

386
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,316
how we're gonna find a 4-inch
flash drive in 3-inch heels.

387
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,151
Canetti had a buddy who works here.

388
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,821
We start by finding out who that
is, and what they know.

389
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,823
Canetti.

390
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,742
Canetti, yeah.

391
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,203
Canetti said something to me right before he died.

392
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,538
He looked at me and he said...

393
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,583
What'd he say?

394
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,834
"It's in the music."

395
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,671
Yeah. You know, something like that.

396
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,340
And I thought he recognized my talent,
knew who the Prodi-G was.

397
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,841
"It's in the music"? Yeah.

398
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,969
Doesn't make sense,

399
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,513
just like everything else that comes out of your mouth.

400
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,307
What? I'm gonna tell you what don't make sense.

401
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:12,270
How they gonna let two fat ladies
go poking around this joint.

402
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,064
They have an opening for a house mother.

403
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,941
(IN GIRLISH VOICE) Say what?

404
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,444
(IN WOMANLY VOICE) Park your tush.

405
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,072
Tuck it! Right over there.

406
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,283
Hi, girl. Hi. Hi.

407
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,868
Hi.

408
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,627
She's expecting me. I's running a little late.

409
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,379
GAIL: Come in!

410
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,633
May I help you?

411
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,261
Honey, it's me who's gonna help you,

412
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,264
and those poor, house motherless girls you got

413
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,266
just waiting for a positive role model.

414
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,603
Hattie Mae Pierce at your service,
but you can call me Big Momma.

415
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:59,442
Oh, yes. You e-mailed your résumé
for the house mother position.

416
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,444
Very qualified, but I think...

417
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,487
Well, thank you!

418
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,407
I will watch over those girls like they were my own.

419
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,242
But, Miss...

420
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,829
Big Momma, we haven't scheduled
any interviews, let alone...

421
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,831
(WHIMPERING)

422
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,751
Look at what those children did to me!

423
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,754
Performance art, my ass!

424
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,630
Beverly, what on earth?

425
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,801
Double-ply? A public school can afford double-ply

426
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,595
and I got to bring in my own Sweet'N Low?

427
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,848
Child, nobody deserves to be treated like that.

428
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,850
That's not the half!

429
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,354
Damn!

430
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,316
Child, you should quit while you
can still do a comb over.

431
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,070
No, Beverly, you promised us two weeks' notice.

432
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:48,407
You know, every day you don't demand
respect, you die just a little.

433
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,118
You die a little.

434
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,373
You know, she's right. Nothing's worth
living with those demon spawn!

435
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,541
"No child left behind."

436
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,336
Well, you watch me. I quit!

437
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,803
Can you start today?

438
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:12,139
Me? Oh, thank you! Sure!

439
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,599
Now, we don't pay very much.

440
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,393
Oh, don't worry about that.

441
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,228
Shoot, I grew up so poor,

442
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,146
we used to go down to Kentucky Fried Chicken

443
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,731
and lick other people's fingers.

444
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,650
Because we couldn't afford the chicken.

445
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,820
And you know, all the grease from
the chicken, we were like...

446
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,865
You know, there is one tiny little issue.

447
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,867
What's that?

448
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,246
Hey. What up?

449
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:41,043
Miss Gail, this is my great-niece,

450
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,170
Charmaine Daisy Pierce.

451
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,672
Hello. Hey.

452
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,092
So many girls! I feel like I'm at a Baskin-Robbins.

453
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,052
A festival of flavors!

454
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,182
(CLEARS THROAT) I mean, um, it's so diverse here.

455
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,978
Ah, yes. Well, we do pride ourselves on diversity.

456
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,983
So tell me, Charmaine, do you think
that you're a good fit for GGSA?

457
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:07,695
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Mmm-hmm. I like to read.

458
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,157
And, uh, I like to, uh,

459
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,658
play music.

460
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,494
And I like salad.

461
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,582
Sweet, delicious, fresh fruit salad.

462
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,919
She's had a stressful few days.

463
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,131
She's only with me because of some family problems.

464
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,717
Mmm-hmm. My parents don't support my art.

465
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,135
They think it's a waste of time.

466
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:35,097
Oh, dear, that is awful. Well, you
have come to the right place.

467
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,308
And my stepfather's always working.

468
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,268
He has an important job in the government.

469
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,145
Which he uses to spy on me.

470
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,939
Ever told the truth, wouldn't have to.

471
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:50,029
Charmaine, you can audit classes
until your transcripts get here,

472
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,822
but I'm afraid, since it's the end of the year,

473
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,407
we don't have a roommate for you.

474
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,284
Oh, any ol' girl will do.

475
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,244
Oh, no. We don't want to put you out.

476
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,747
Charmaine'll just stay with her Big Momma.

477
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,667
But my shrink in juvie said I'd do better
with a role model my own age.

478
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,503
You'll be on the same floor as your peers.

479
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,837
Before you know it, you'll be bosom buddies.

480
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,590
(GASPS) Charmaine likes the sound of that!

481
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,433
GAIL: Welcome to your new home.

482
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,644
I'll just show you to your room.

483
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,354
Some of the girls have gone to dinner,

484
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,980
so you'll just see them there.

485
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,023
Okay.

486
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,483
Oh, there's Mia! Mia.

487
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,152
(GASPS) Damn!

488
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,115
Mia, this is your new house mother, Big Momma,

489
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,701
and this is her niece, Charmaine, your new classmate.

490
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,786
Hi.

491
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,121
Mia is a very promising young actress.

492
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,459
Oh, I'm okay. I mean, I can do light
comedy, like Sandra Bullock.

493
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,670
Well, you know, before the Oscar.

494
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,713
But I really need to work on expanding my range,

495
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,340
in the way that Kate Winslet does.

496
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,051
And Mrs. Orth from Movement says that
I need to listen to my inner voice,

497
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,553
but there's just so many of them,

498
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:59,390
and the loudest one's always screaming,
"Delanté's pulling away!"

499
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,891
My God! Delanté's pulling away.

500
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,353
I think I should go now.

501
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,938
Girl, you need a hug!

502
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,484
She gets a little emotional. Who the hell is Delanté?

503
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,820
Delanté is the boyfriend.

504
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,196
Oh.

505
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,659
Gail, maybe we should freshen up before dinner.

506
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:22,580
All this transition is a bit much for Charmaine.

507
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,748
She should probably rest her eyes

508
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,585
or become unconscious for a moment or two.

509
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,838
I totally understand. Your room
is at the end of the hall.

510
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,634
Well, look at the wallpaper! It's so nice!

511
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,681
Look. There's a ballerina on the bed.

512
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,766
I'm Jasmine.

513
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,895
And here's the 411 you probably
didn't get on your tour.

514
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,814
I call the shots around here.

515
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:49,940
So, if you two stay out of the way,

516
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,567
we shouldn't have any problems.

517
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,818
Okay?

518
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,656
Now you listen to me, Tinker Bell.

519

523
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,215
I'm going to unpack.

Thank you. I have an announcement.

00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,574
Last night, an antique music box was stolen

684
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,659
from our library's special collection.

Now, I know we have a tradition of pranks.

But this is not stealing the mascot
from the boys at St. Ignatius.

No, this is a crime

689

against one of our own, which will not be tolerated!

690
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,636
So I strongly suggest that the guilty party,

691

or anyone who knows anything
about this, come forward

Yeah, the first graduating class gifted it to the school.

would want to steal it.

down the reference room,

836

And so is the music box.

837

Hmm.

838
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,977
I saw a picture of a man in your office.

839

He looked familiar.

840

972
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,160
(GROANING)

973
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:10,000
Now I know why they call it The Nutcracker.

974
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,503
I was twirling.

975
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,341
CHIRKOFF: Have you seen this guy?

976
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,425
BOTH: No.

977
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,303
I'm looking for this Prodi-G. Have you seen him?

978
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:25,599
I'm a record producer. I'm very
interested in talking to him.

979
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:29,186
Oh, for realsie? You're standing before his DJ!

980
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,730
Yeah, and, um, I'm his business partner.

981
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:32,982
You're not his partner.

982
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,483
You're his hype man. Whatever.

983
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,485
Have you seen him?

984
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,404
MIA since Sunday.

985
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,824
The Prodi-G, he's been known
to go on personal retreats

986
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,367
to exorcise his demons.

987
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,703
Let me give you my card.

988
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,830
If you see him, call me.

989
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:49,957
Maybe we can all do business.

990
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:54,628
Most definitely! Business sounds
good, baby. Take care now.

991
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,715
Let me see that card.

992
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,550
TRENT: So, tell me once again.

993
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,718
Why do I have to go to art?

994
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:02,219
Because you're a student here

995
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,138
and you need to keep up your cover.

996
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,431
This ain't even my type of art.

997
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,557
Oh, shut up!

998
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,602
Oh!

999
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,897
You must be our new student, Charmaine.

1000
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,106
Hey!

1001
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,566
Just in time for figure day.

1002
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,985
Oh! Here's our nude model!

1003
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,447
Now, you just disrobe whenever you feel comfortable.

1004
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,158
Now that's my type of art!

1005
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:32,249
Oh, no, no! Ain't nobody getting naked!

1006
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,709
That'd be shameful.

1007
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:38,589
What on earth do you mean, Big
Momma? This is a fine art class.

1008
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,216
We're studying the human form.

1009
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,303
Yep. That's right, Big Momma. This is fine art.

1010
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,722
And she is mighty fine.

1011
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,767
And besides, we're all women here.

1012
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,187
(STAMMERS) Well, of course. I know that.

1013
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,733
But what you're doing, you know, with
this woman getting naked...

1014
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,569
What you're doing is you're reinforcing

1015
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,863
a terrible stereotype.

1016
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,658
Yeah, um,

1017
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,703
92.6 % of the females in this country

1018
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,497
are size 12 or bigger!

1019
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,916
Really? Yeah!

1020
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,627
What with the media images

1021
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,338
telling girls that they won't be happy

1022
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,715
unless they're a size negative zero,

1023
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,802
well, that just distorts our body image!

1024
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,013
And causes eating disorders.

1025
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,099
And alopecia.

1026
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,558
Oh. Yeah.

1027
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,811
And no offense, young lady,

1028
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:37,982
but you got a little body and a big-ass head! Yeah.

1029
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:40,234
The circumference on that thing is like...

1030
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,486
Oh, don't listen to her!

1031
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,739
She's having hot flashes. Go ahead,
girl, show us what you got!

1032
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,574
Wait. No.

1033
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,618
You know,

1034
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,705
I think I agree with Big Momma.

1035
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,164
You do? Yes.

1036
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,710
We have never once had a full-figured model.

1037
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,670
(STAMMERING) It's shameful.

1038
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:02,172
Shameful!

1039
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,382
So how about it, Big Momma?

1040
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,426
Excuse me?

1041
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,761
I think you should be our model.

1042
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,430
Amen!

1043
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,807

(CLEARING THROAT)

1045
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,894
Yeah, it's all clear in here.

1046
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,896
Pipes are great.

1047
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,773
I think you should be our model.

1048
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,568
Big Momma don't be getting butt naked for nobody!

1049
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,777
Oh, come on. No, I don't get down like that.

1050
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,862
You're beautiful!

1051
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,114
I know I'm beautiful, but I don't get down like that.

1052
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,824
Oh! No.

1053
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,890
I need more pastels.

1054
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,476
I need a huge canvas.

1055
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:59,897
Excuse me, but shouldn't I be eating some grapes,

1056
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,857
or a cheeseburger or something?

1057

You are an inspiration just as you are.

1058

Okay. Class.

1059
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:10,491
It's time for a new pose. Artists, grab a new canvas.

Oh, okay. Well, um...

Very good.

00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,212
Don't be shy.

1067
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:27,841
Like you said, these girls need role models.

1068

Well, I got a lot of rolls, but they're
not exactly the kind...

Oh, come on, Big Momma, let it all hang out!

Wrapped in that sheet, you look like Aphrodite.

More like the centerfold for Thick and Juicy.

00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,220
A little tip about Big Momma.

The more she resists, the more she wants you.

What you talking? That's terrible!

Uh, I do now.

Okay. All right.

All right, all right. I had to get
dressed! What is all this...

Oh, my God.

1105
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,686
You told me she was going to kill herself.

Calm down. Tell Big Momma what happened.

1109
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,861
We bought hair dye at Walgreens

1110
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,030
and the directions were in Spanish.

1111
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,531
She takes French.

1112
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:18,035
Child, don't you know cheap
hair dye is like an old man?

1113
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,662
It don't last long and it marks up the furniture.

1114
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,039
I thought if I looked different,

1115
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,291
Delanté would fall back in love with me.

1116
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,001
You look different, all right.

1117
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,669
But now, listen.

1118
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:30,589
He has got to love you for all the
stuff you can't buy in no store.

1119
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,007
And if he don't,

1120
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:35,135
then don't change yourself, change your man.

1121
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,429
Huh? We feeling the deepness?

1122
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,473
Huh? Think about that.

1123
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,770
What about my hair?

1124
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,480
Oh, well, that's got to go.

1125
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,607
Yeah, we're gonna wash that
fella right out of your hair.

1126
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,948
Ew, not that.

1127
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,950
Definitely not that! (GASPS)

1128
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:00,661
This. Mmm-mmm.

1129
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,871
I'm not sure that's me. You know?

1130
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,123
I know what's you. Trust me.

No way.

I could hook you up with, girl.

Really? Yep.

01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,364
Who? He's my cousin.

1241
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:14,951
His name is Trent. Hottie. Buff. Right?

1242
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:18,455
He's our age. Plus, he's like a hip-hop lyrical miracle.

1243
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,248
You've probably seen him perform at the Promenade.

(GIRLISHLY) Yeah, yeah!

1247
01:05:24,628 --> 01:05:26,212
Thinks he's all that and then some?

1248
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,839
Talks about himself in the third person

1249
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:31,217
and thinks that every girl on the planet is after him?

1250
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:33,303
No offense, Charmaine,

1251
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,930
but your cousin is the last kind
of guy I'd ever hook up with.

So, uh,

1256
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,195
what is your type?

1257
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:52,322
He's artistic.

1258
01:05:52,656 --> 01:05:56,117
Sensitive. Interested in people besides himself.

1259
01:05:58,329 --> 01:05:59,996
And he likes long,

1260
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:03,041
sweet, slow, lingering kisses.

1261
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:06,252
Damn.

1262
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:08,171
Damn!

1263
01:06:08,672 --> 01:06:10,590
What? Are you making fun of me?

1264
01:06:10,674 --> 01:06:14,260
Oh, no, girl. No, I'm saying that's exactly Trent.

1265
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,305
Sure, he can be all puffed up on the outside,

1266
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:18,473
but once you get to know him,

1267
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:19,891
I'm saying, he's a real sweetheart.

1268
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:23,436
I mean, you guys should, like, be a couple!

1269
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:25,397
He was thinking about going
to the Showcase tomorrow.

1270
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,774
Maybe you guys can hook up,
you know, after the dance.

1271
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:29,442
Tomorrow night.

1272
01:06:29,693 --> 01:06:31,111
I don't know. Can I meet him before?

1273
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:33,905
(CHUCKLING) No! It's tomorrow night.

1274
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,075
Well, how about tonight, then?

1275
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,620
Oh, he'll be there.

01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,414

and what did you do? You go shopping.

1281
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:57,011
Look, shopping is a very big deal for girls.

1282
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:00,098
It's like their sports. If they ain't
doing it, they're talking about it.

1283
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:02,517
Comparing stats, tracking sales.

1284
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:03,810
It's like a fantasy league, you know?

1285
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,688
So help me, Trent, if you're
falling for that Haley girl...

(STAMMERING) I'm not going for Haley. I mean... No.

01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:18,491
Okay, so, why don't we just go
down there and intercept it?

1290
01:07:18,742 --> 01:07:21,202
MALCOLM: Not yet. Surveillance is a waiting game.

1291
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,371
We can't do anything that could blow our cover.

1292
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:25,540
Besides, if Mia is spinning us,

1293
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,834
let's just hope that if it is the music box,

1294
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,919
that the flash drive's still inside it.

1295
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,629
Oh, okay.

1296
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:35,967
(SIGHS) So we just wait here.

1297
01:07:36,343 --> 01:07:38,636
(HUMMING)

1298
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,018
Wait a minute. Is that the Tempts?

1299
01:07:45,769 --> 01:07:47,562
Not too old school for you?

1300
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:50,148
No, actually, I was thinking about
sampling it for my mix tape.

1301
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:51,941
Can you sing it?

1302
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,068
I'd rather hum.

1303
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:58,156
I mean, but if you sing it, I can catch a
vibe and I can have a dope mix tape

1304
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:01,409
with some old-school jams on
there. Then we can like...

1305
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:02,994
All right.

1306
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,164
(SINGING) Papa was a rolling stone

1307
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,709
Wherever he laid his hat was his home

1308
01:08:09,793 --> 01:08:10,793

1310
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:16,591
And we in the place and we on a case

1311
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:19,010
Vibin' out to an old-school jam

1312
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,429
(LAUGHS) I like that.

1313
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:24,224
I like how you put the little new
school with the old school.

1314
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,017
I could feel that.

1315
01:08:26,101 --> 01:08:29,604
I could jam to that. I could, you
know, do this little thing I do.

1316
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:31,189
Now, what's that?

1317
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:33,358
A little something I used to do back in the day

1318
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,442
called the Cleveland Shuffle.

1319
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,277
Oh, no, I need that. Come on.

1320
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:37,487
Well, it's two to the right.

1321
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:38,613
Okay.

1322
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:41,241
Two to the left. Now freak with it.

1323
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:44,702
Freak with it. Freak with it, freak with it.

1324
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:48,039
Kick. Now you get your spin on. Right?

1325
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:49,958
Right? Bring it back.

1326
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,085
(EXCLAIMS) Then you freak with it.

1327
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:54,045
Freak with it. That's right.

1328
01:08:54,129 --> 01:08:56,798
And your arms got to be in a little T. rex position.

1329
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,633
Okay. So a little something...

1330
01:08:58,717 --> 01:08:59,801
Now freak with it.

1331
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,302
So it's like the Soulja Boy, right?

1332
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:04,681
No, Soulja Boy, that's a little hop thing.

1333
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,683
I know what you're talking about,
but that's a little hop thing.

1334
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:08,434
This is... This is more like this?

1335
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,687
This is Tempts. When them boys was...

1336
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,480
I like that. You know, "Oooh!"

1337
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,065
You know, that kind of thing.

1338
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:16,484
That's why I like doing this move.

1339
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:18,903
'Cause it's not that complicated.

Wait, what's up?

1342
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:28,288
There are the girls. All right.

1343
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:31,040
Chirkoff must have gotten to Kurtis Kool

1344
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,251
and Kurtis Kool got the girls to steal the music box.

1345
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:34,627
I can't believe that.

1346
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,672
Look, Trent. Get back in that dress, all right?

1347
01:09:37,756 --> 01:09:38,840
I'm gonna check it out.

1348
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:39,966
Okay.

brings a man to his knees

Wow, a security guard with stalkers.

1358
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,473
I'm a curious woman.

1359
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,643
Why don't you come and throw
back some juice with me?

1360
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,811
Let me satisfy that curiosity.

1361
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:40,026
Well, all right. A little juice.

What's up? How you doing?

1369
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:23,236
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late. These poetry
readings always run long.

Yeah.

1372
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:32,954
And I like slow, lingering kisses.

1373
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:36,124
You know, it's weird that you would say that.

1374
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:38,918
Yeah, 'cause you feel the same way, too, right?

1375
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,838
No, it's just weird that you would say that.

1376
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:50,138
Right, right. Because rap don't allow
me to get my sensitivities out.

1377
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:53,391
And I got a lot of sensitivities

I like to get out. As a man, it's like...

They're deep. It's like an ocean inside me.

we get all our sensitivities out,
you know what I'm saying?

This isn't who I am. This is...

1394

Okay, then, who are you?

1395
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:46,194
I don't know. I don't know who I am.

1396
01:12:46,278 --> 01:12:48,654
I'm still trying to figure that out.

Can you hear this? No...

1448
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:18,137
Yeah. Yeah, we found our boy!

1449
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:19,805
(ENGINE STARTING)

1450
01:15:27,272 --> 01:15:29,607
Trent! Yo!

1451
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:34,278
Whoa! Rembrandt. Wow.

1452
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,031
Yeah. This is my crew.

1453
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:38,532
This is Rembrandt and Scratch.

1454
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:39,659
Hey.

1455
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:41,160
How you doing? How you doing?

1456
01:15:41,244 --> 01:15:43,287
Yo, you got your step-pop to sign the contract yet?

1457
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,872
Yeah, man, I'm on it.

1458
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,290
Come on, I want to take you somewhere.

1459
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,042
Okay.

1460
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:50,086
See you guys later. See you guys.

1461
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:51,170
All right.

1462
01:15:51,254 --> 01:15:52,380
Yeah, you do that!

1463
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:54,298
'Cause we got somebody we want you to meet.

1464
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,133
Yeah, I'll holler. Okay.

1465
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,718
Yeah, yeah! Tomorrow, Trent!

1466
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:01,555
Scratch and Rembrandt, they're like,
I don't know, one's tall, one's short.

1467
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,516
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I noticed that.

1468
01:16:05,268 --> 01:16:06,519
We found him.

1469
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:09,981
CHIRKOFF: Just stay with him. See
if he leads you to the father.

1470
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,232
Okay.

1471
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,490
Let the games begin.

1472
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:23,995
You know, these girls of mine are driving me up a wall.

1473
01:16:24,287 --> 01:16:26,580
You know Jasmine Lee and Isabelle Parada?

1474
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:29,000
No, refresh my memory.

1475
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:30,835
Left foot, red.

1476
01:16:34,589 --> 01:16:36,966
They gave you a bag about an hour ago.

1477
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:40,302
Right foot, yellow.

1478
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:47,101
Oh! That Jasmine and Isabelle.

1479
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,979
(GRUNTS) Sorry, Big Momma.

1480
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:54,316
You know, those girls could be in a
lot of trouble. And so could you.

1481
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:56,902
So who you holding that bag for?

1482
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:59,113
Someone outside the school?

1483
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,365
You really want to see that bag?

1484
01:17:02,617 --> 01:17:03,743
Damn!

1485
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:07,121
Right hand, blue.

1486
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,081
Are you...

1487
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:11,292
Is it blue?

1488
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,419
Mmm-hmm. Right hand, blue.

1489
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,135
Come to papa.

1490
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:39,070
(BOTH GRUNTING)

1491
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:41,072
KURTIS: Left hand, green!

1492
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,699
Oh, well...

1493
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:46,827
Looks like we're all out of green. Game over.

1494
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:50,039
No, no, no. I got your green.

1495
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,709
(GRUNTS)

1496
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:56,670
Okay. Go ahead. Reach for the stars, baby.

1497
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,130
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Oh, hell, no!

1498
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,466
What's wrong with your voice?

1499
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:03,260
You heard me. Get your ass up.

1500
01:18:06,473 --> 01:18:07,598
Sister, you a brother?

1501
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:11,811
Not again.

1502
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,814
You touch me again, I'll knock you into next Sunday.

1503
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:18,025
Hand over the bag. Hand over the bag, now!

1504
01:18:20,403 --> 01:18:23,531
Every time I try to meet somebody,
it's ding-a-ling-a-ling!

1505
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:25,116
Be quiet! All right?

1506
01:18:25,325 --> 01:18:28,702
I'm undercover. FBI. Now give me the damn bag.

1507
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,830
Wow. (EXCLAIMS IMPATIENTLY)

1508
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:40,673
What the hell?

1509
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:52,309
What the hell is a grown man
doing with a damn rooster?

1510
01:18:52,727 --> 01:18:55,146
(SIGHS) The girls stole it from St. Ignatius.

1511
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:57,731
The boys' school? They're the Gamecocks.

1512
01:18:58,191 --> 01:19:00,151
They were gonna give it back after the Showcase.

1513
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,237
(CLUCKING)

1514
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:06,448
You want to finish the game?

1515
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:10,744
Come on.

1516
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:11,996
Where are we going?

1517
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,664
You'll see. Okay.

1518
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,216
Wow.

1519
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:26,760
It's my home away from home.

1520
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,470
This is nice.

1521
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:29,597
Tomorrow night's the Showcase

1522
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:32,183
and it's my best shot at getting
a scholarship for composition.

1523
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:34,685
Without a scholarship, I'm out.

1524
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,563
Everyone is gonna be there, you know?

1525
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:40,024
Juilliard, Berklee, Peabody and Oberlin.

1526
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:43,235
All right, look. Okay. So, I see
a beautiful woman right now.

1527
01:19:43,403 --> 01:19:45,112
I see a dope piano.

1528
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,615
And nobody's playing it.

1529
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:50,201
You want me to play?

1530
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:52,369
Yeah.

1531
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:53,454
Right now.

1532
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,539
All right, I guess I gotta play it.

1533
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,875
No, no, don't touch my piano.

1534
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:01,086
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1535
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:03,380
(CLEARING THROAT)

1536
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:08,093
Okay, please don't judge. It's rough.

1537
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:12,223
(PLAYING SOULFUL TUNE)

(SINGING WORDLESS MELODY)

1539
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,359
See? It's not totally there yet.

1540
01:20:23,443 --> 01:20:24,735
I don't know, something's missing.

1541
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:27,112
No, it's not missing nothing. It's tight.

1542
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,573
You just got to feel it, you know what I mean?

1543
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,451
You got to, like, speed it up a little bit.

1544
01:20:32,535 --> 01:20:33,994
Speed it up? Yeah.

1545
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:36,121
Okay, um...

1546
01:20:36,539 --> 01:20:38,540
(PLAYING SLIGHTLY FASTER)

1547
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:41,085
Yeah. Yeah.

01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,920
That's better, right? Yeah.

Yeah, I like that, I like that.

01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:14,201
You like that?

1555
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:15,995
Should we syncopate it?

1556
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:19,957
(SIGHS) Look, normally, I don't syncopate
on the first date, but...

01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:35,889
All right, this is what we're gonna do next, right?

1560
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:38,100
You're gonna go up a little higher.
You know what I mean?

1561
01:21:38,184 --> 01:21:39,935
Up an octave?

1562
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,687
Yeah, an octave.

It's perfect, right?

Thank you!

I can't believe you don't want to go to college.

I mean, all of those writers and poets you could study.

You know, I just figured I got
to strike while the iron's hot.

Jay-Z didn't drop Reasonable Doubt until he was 27.

1930
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:19,984
Shut your mouth!

1931
01:43:20,819 --> 01:43:23,070
You just gonna hurt these innocent children?

1932
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,447
Give me the flash drive.

1933
01:43:24,531 --> 01:43:25,781
What if I say no?

1934
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:27,575
I'm pretty good with this gun.

1935
01:43:27,659 --> 01:43:29,660
My late husband Othar taught me how to use it

1936
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:32,038
in case of a home invasion.

1937
01:43:36,001 --> 01:43:39,712
Give him the gun, or I shoot the kids.

1938
01:43:48,055 --> 01:43:49,388
Now,

1939
01:43:50,932 --> 01:43:52,016
the flash drive.

1940
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:00,733
Very good, Agent Turner.

1941
01:44:00,817 --> 01:44:04,070
It took me a while to figure out. Then I remember.

1942
01:44:04,821 --> 01:44:07,156
You're the master of disguise.

1943
01:44:13,747 --> 01:44:16,582
Take off the fat suit. I want to check you for weapons.

1944
01:44:22,714 --> 01:44:25,508
Look, don't shoot the kids, all right?

1945
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:27,385
He don't remember what he saw.

1946
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:30,304
Kill them.

1947
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:33,099
And this time, no witnesses.

1948
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,309
My pleasure. Hey, Trent.

1949
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:36,852
CHIRKOFF: I'm checking the flash drive.

1950
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:40,356
I'm sorry. I was wrong to think we could pull this off.

1951
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,816
This is my fault.

1952
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,026
No. You was just trying to protect me.

1953
01:44:44,111 --> 01:44:47,446
I lied to you and everything. I'm sorry, Dad.

1954
01:44:49,616 --> 01:44:52,118
All right, this family hour has to
end. I'm going to throw up.

1955
01:44:52,202 --> 01:44:54,829
Hey, whoa. Just let me say one last thing to my boy.

1956
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,709
You know, I'll go to my grave
wishing we could have done

1957
01:45:00,794 --> 01:45:02,211
that Cleveland Shuffle together.

1958
01:45:02,295 --> 01:45:04,046
Remember? Mmm.

1959
01:45:04,131 --> 01:45:05,756
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

1960
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:08,551
Killer step. If I just had one more chance.

1961
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:10,261
Remember, it'd be two to the right,

1962
01:45:10,345 --> 01:45:11,679
(GRUNTING IN RHYTHM)

1963
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:13,722
two to the left.

1964
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:16,767
BOTH: Now freak with it, freak with
it. Freak with it, freak with it.

1965
01:45:22,482 --> 01:45:24,692
Enough! No more mistakes.

1966
01:45:25,819 --> 01:45:27,653
I never leave a witness.

1967
01:45:29,322 --> 01:45:30,656
Wait.

01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:38,998
My name is Kurtis Kool

Kurtis Kool.

1973
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:49,383
You saved my boy. Thank you, man.

1974
01:45:49,468 --> 01:45:52,261
Just protecting the next generation of hip-hop.

1975
01:45:57,559 --> 01:45:59,268
Haley, hi.

1976
01:45:59,352 --> 01:46:01,020
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1977
01:46:01,354 --> 01:46:02,396
I knew she was a narc.

1978
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:04,190
Hey, he's not a narc, he's a fed.

You know, I realize there's no rush to greatness.

1996
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:15,594
I mean, you only get one chance to be the new guy.
