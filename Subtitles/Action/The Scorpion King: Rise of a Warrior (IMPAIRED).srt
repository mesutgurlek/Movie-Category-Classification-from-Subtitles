Good.
Then riches and glory will be yours.

But, Mathayus,
betray me even once

00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,212
and you will pray to the gods
for a quick death.

I'm a quick learner, I hope.

Bring in the prisoner.

178
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,325
He was overheard
slandering my name.

179
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,961
And the punishment is death.

Wait. But this is my...
I know.

You do the deed yourself,

you prove your loyalty to me
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

to make it quick.

because there are pirates,

You know, this may come
as a shock to you,

291
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,849
but not everything
in the world happens because of you.

292
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,508
Then why are you
going to Egypt?

293
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:07,915
Because...

294
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:12,479
Everyone should go and see the pyramids
once in their lives.

295

Why are you going to Egypt?

296
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,054
Personal matters

297
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,521
which don't concern you.

298
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,857
Don't play coy with me.
You know I'll get it out of you anyway.

299
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,161
All right.

300
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:31,606
My father once fought for the pharaoh's
private guard and saved his life.

301
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:34,201
So, I'm going to ask if in return
he'll let me borrow

302
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,271
the Spear of Osiris
to help me defeat Sargon.

303
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,175
The Pharaoh of Egypt

304
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:44,150
is going to lend one of the most
fabled weapons in history

305
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,282
to a 19-year-old kid
he's never even heard of?

306
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,157
I don't remember
asking your opinion.

307
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,854
Actually,

308
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,297
I'm afraid she's right.
It wouldn't work.

309
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,931
But mainly for the simple reason
that the Spear of Osiris

310
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,903
is only effective
against Egyptian monsters.

311
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:04,499
Such as the winged scarab,
sphinxes and cursed mummies.

312
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,768
And you know this how?

313
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,873
Let's just say
I'm well connected.

314
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,281
Really? And who
are you exactly?

315
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,716
Aristophanes of Naxos.

316
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:20,417
Not to be confused with the Aristophanes
from Corinth. That hack.

317
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,484
I speak 20 languages fluently
and another 20 passably.

318
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,426
So if you need
any translation services...

319
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,660
Yes, yes. How did you learn
about the Spear of Osiris?

320
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:32,134
I am a poet and playwright by trade
and sometimes a musician.

321
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:35,900
And was most recently
court poet to the king of Elam.

322
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:41,044
Petty despot. May he rot in the
underworld for his lack of esthetic taste.

323
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,309
And learned of it from one of
his high priests.

324
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:47,317
But you are thinking
along the right path.

325
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,120
To defeat a man like Sargon,
well-versed in the black arts,

326
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,022
one would require
a potent weapon indeed.

327
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,686
Like?

328
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,694
Let's see.

329
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,927
There's the Hammer of Zeus.
No, too unwieldy.

330
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,662
The Shield of Cronos.
That's completely discredited.

331
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,067
The Cloak of...

332
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:10,665
I've got it!
The Sword of Damocles!

333
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,004
The what?

334
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,011
Damocles. You know.

335
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,638
The one condemned to die
a thousand deaths

336
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:22,550
by the very hand of the sword that he used
to kill King Philpman.

337
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:25,488
(GROANS)

338
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,456
What do they teach you
in Akkadian schools these days?

339
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,960
Not to touch
other men's swords.

340
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,521
Well, in any case,

341
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,590
according to Book Five of
Herodotus' <i>Histories,</i>

342
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,570
Damocles' infamous sword was transformed
by a lightning bolt from Zeus

343
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:44,665
into a wondrous weapon whose blade
could cut through anything.

344
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,767
Mortal or immortal.

345
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,372
And presented as a gift
to the Queen of the Underworld.

346
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:53,246
You're saying this sword
can cut through anything?

347
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:54,751
Oh, please.

348
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,784
Anything.

349
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,388
And you know
where this sword is?

350
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,052
This has to be the most harebrained
scheme I've heard yet today,

351
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,254
and that is saying plenty.

352
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,696
Oh, and you
have a better idea.

353
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,765
Okay. I've decided.

354
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,400
We're gonna continue
on our journey to Knossos.

355
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:18,567
And you're gonna lead me
to the Sword of Damocles.

356
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:22,272
My friend, such a journey would be
fraught with perils.

357
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,373
The Underworld is a grim and
dangerous place of condemned souls

358
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,439
suffering unspeakable...

359
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:28,508
How much do you want?

360
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,714
Exclusive rights to compose
an epic ode of your quest

361
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,814
and one hundred silver staters,
for expenses.

362
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,950
Wait. A hundred?

363
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,688
For risking my life,
it's a pittance.

364
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,863
A lady doesn't part
with her dowry that easily.

365
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,392
Here we go.

366
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,166
First of all,
I'm coming along.

367
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,331
Wait. Forget it.

368
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,036
Second, you will treat me with respect
and as your equal.

369
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,412
If not, your superior.

370
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:07,783
LAYLA: Thirty-fifth, you will launder my
undergarments daily in fresh rosewater.

371
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,656
Forty-seventh, you will bathe and
rub my feet with olive oil once a day.

372
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,289
Don't push it.

373
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,530
Hey, Greek.

374
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,865
Call me Ari, my sweet.

375
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,065
In case you get any funny ideas
about losing us

376
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,267
or making off with my money,
just remember this.

377
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:27,243
Akkadian women are just as handy with
a dagger as Akkadian men.

378
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:30,543
I'm sure that's not the only thing
you're handy at, fair maiden,

00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,812
whose beauty makes even
goddesses blush with envy.

380

Hey, save your flowery words
for your scribblings.

381
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:38,281
Focus on the task at hand,

382
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,984
which is getting
us into that.

383
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,691
Alive.

384
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,464
Of course.

385
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,852
(WHISPERING) Perhaps, Layla here might use
her feminine wiles

386
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,127
to distract the guards
whilst we slip past them.

387
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,139
This I have to see.

388
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,403

Nice night, isn't it?

389

390

00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,276
isn't she?

392
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,151
You should see her
in a bad mood.

393
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,385
Hmm.

Come on, let's go.

396
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,468
These keys
should get us into the palace.

397
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,530
But then we need
to find the labyrinth.

398
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:06,338
The portal to the Underworld
lies within the labyrinth.

399
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:07,742

The Minotaur.

427

A creature
half man, half bull.

428

A crazed monster whose appetite must
be satisfied daily with human flesh.

429

King Minos believes that the Minotaur

00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,830
Where are you going?

487
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,490
Now I'm scared.

488
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,731
Let's go.

489
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,160
Now!

490
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,361
Shouldn't we
be following him?

491
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,270
He's out of his mind.

492
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:25,905
Or not.

00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,947
You've gotta be kidding me.

MATHAYUS: Layla!

(ROARING)

502
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,923
Ugly old slab of beef!

503
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,362
Your mother was a cow!

00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:36,005
MATHAYUS: Don't worry.

509
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,303
It didn't go too deep.

510
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,740
A little higher up and you would
have been in trouble.

511
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:45,941
A little higher up and you might
be in trouble.

You'll be okay.

514
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:53,955
Wait here.

515
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,399
Your silence is praise enough.

516
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,430
That was you?

517
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,103
Music has charms
to soothe the savage beast.

518
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,842
Say, that's good.

519
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,591
I'm sorry for your loss,

520
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,889
but most grateful
for your help.

521
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,563
It was a debt
I owed your father.

522
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,733
We fought together in the war against
the Hittites.

523
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,771
And he saved my life.

524
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:47,268
Your debt is repaid then.

525
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,877
Damn right it is.
Let's go, men.

526
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,612
Where we're going we could use
some brave fighters.

527
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:59,315
There's strength in numbers
and great riches to be had.

528
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,820
Where?

529
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:02,857
Tell him.

530
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,252
You tell him.

531
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,789
I'll tell him.

532
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,061
The Underworld.

533
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:12,932
Oh, the Underworld.

534
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:17,005
There's a portal inside the center
of this labyrinth.

535
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,409
Well, good luck to you.

536
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,240
No one has ever returned alive
from that place.

537
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,942
MATHAYUS: Gilgamesh did it.
Never heard of him.

538
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,279
So did Herodotus.

539
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:29,410
So he claims.

540
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:30,748
Do you know
what else he claims?

541
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,652
When he visited the Underworld
he saw with his own eyes

542
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:36,090
enough gold, diamonds and rubies
to fill a thousand arenas.

543
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,095
He was literally crunching on a fortune
with every step.

544
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:43,691
But you, veteran warriors, wouldn't be
interested in such a hazardous journey

545
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:46,565
as that taken
by an old Greek historian.

546
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:51,301
And soon by a poet, a young Akkadian lad
and a girl.

547
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:55,434
Greeks. Greeks.

549
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:08,917
Okay.

550
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,826
(SPEAKING CANTONESE)

551
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,437
Wait. Why is he coming?

552
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:25,139
Well, I thought
we could use the extra body.

553
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:28,804
I told him the Underworld
was a shortcut back to China.

554
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:51,995
Now what?

555
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,435
ARI: The portal is
in here somewhere.
