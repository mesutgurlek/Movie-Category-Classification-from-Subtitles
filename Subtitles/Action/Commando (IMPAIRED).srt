of discipline.

Why tell me?

Because you're going
to return to Val Verde,

We went to a lot

We had to pretend
Captain Bennett's death...

138
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,509

Nothing like old war buddies.

Well, have a nice trip, now.

Take care.
Oh, here.

Have some beers in Val Verde.

168
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:36,527
It'll give everyone more time
with your daughter.

169
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:40,423
You're a funny guy, Sully.
I like you.

170
00:20:40,468 --> 00:20:42,402
That's why I'll kill you last.

And you're 7b, sir.

Any carry-on luggage?

176
00:21:26,147 --> 00:21:27,341
Just him.

177
00:21:31,118 --> 00:21:34,315
Open your mouth again,
I'll nail it shut.

178
00:21:35,623 --> 00:21:37,352
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

179
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:38,722
Thank you.

180
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,750
Could I have
a blanket and a pillow?

181
00:21:40,795 --> 00:21:41,819

Fasten your seat belts
and extinguish all cigarettes.

187

Once we reach
our cruising altitude,

188
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:09,421
we'll be serving
complimentary beverages...

189

00:22:11,425 --> 00:22:14,087
After that, we'll be showing
our feature film.

Excuse me.
How long is the flight?

195
00:22:38,018 --> 00:22:40,486
We land in Val Verde
in 11 hours.

196
00:22:40,521 --> 00:22:42,489
Thank you.
And do me a favor...

197
00:22:42,523 --> 00:22:44,923
Don't disturb my friend.
He's dead tired.

198
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:53,425
Upright, please.
Thank you.

199
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:56,265
Sir, during takeoff,
you must remain seated.

200
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:57,861
I'm airsick.

00:25:51,876 --> 00:25:55,437
Yeah, the bird has flown.
The cargo's aboard.

203
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,641
Now go to the drop-off point.

204
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:01,015
Yes. Gracias, Sully.

205
00:26:04,155 --> 00:26:06,419
We are right on schedule.

206
00:26:06,457 --> 00:26:08,425
With any good fortune,

207
00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:12,418
today will be my last day
as a civilian.

208
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,934
Your father seems
to be cooperating.

209
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:20,699
You will be together
with him soon.

210
00:26:21,973 --> 00:26:23,668
Won't that be nice?

211
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:27,371
Not nearly as nice as
watching him smash your face in.

212
00:26:30,948 --> 00:26:32,108
Take her below.

213

Well, my 7:40 flight
to Vancouver was canceled.

215
00:27:07,018 --> 00:27:09,452
So, how about dinner?

216
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:10,818
Yeah.

217
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,023
I could go to bed early, too.

218

OK. Well, I like you, too.

All right.
Talk to you soon. Bye.

221
00:27:34,712 --> 00:27:38,580
Love and careers. It's tough.
Sounds like you need a date.

222
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:39,605
Well, I don't.

223

Girls like you meet
a lot of nice boys at airports.

Listen, you're really
bugging me.

Hey!

226
00:28:36,941 --> 00:28:38,340
Hey, slow down.

227
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:48,615
-I got something to give you.
-I'm not interested.

228
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:50,143
You don't know
what you're missing.

229
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:53,987
It looks like a nightmare.
Please leave me alone!

I knew you would say that.

240

Don't get offended, but are you
going to kill me or something?

241
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:22,437
No.

242
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,778
You wouldn't tell me
if you were.

-Sure, I would.
-Really?

WOMAN: Can you tell me
what this is about?

249
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:46,194
A guy I trusted for years
wants me dead.

250
00:30:46,237 --> 00:30:49,604
I've only known you 5 minutes,

He's the only chance I've got
of finding her.

256
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:37,339
If he sees me or I lose him,
they'll kill her.

I need you to follow him,
tell him you're crazy about him.

Somewhere

653
01:27:14,331 --> 01:27:16,196
Somehow

654
01:27:16,967 --> 01:27:18,730
Someone

655
01:27:20,404 --> 01:27:22,372
I fight with fire

656
01:27:23,073 --> 01:27:26,236
As I watch them conspire

657
01:27:26,277 --> 01:27:29,303
To blow my world apart

658
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:31,875
Between the light

659
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:35,045
And the endless night

660
01:27:35,085 --> 01:27:38,987
You will always be in my heart

661
01:27:39,823 --> 01:27:41,984
We fight for love

662
01:27:44,595 --> 01:27:46,620
We fight for love

663
01:27:49,566 --> 01:27:51,363
Fight for love

664
01:27:54,271 --> 01:27:56,501
We fight for love

665
01:28:00,544 --> 01:28:01,943
Somewhere

666
01:28:02,947 --> 01:28:04,414
Somehow

667
01:28:05,382 --> 01:28:06,815
Someone

668
01:28:10,054 --> 01:28:11,578
Somewhere

669
01:28:12,523 --> 01:28:14,047
Somehow

670
01:28:14,992 --> 01:28:16,516
Someone

671
01:28:19,697 --> 01:28:21,289
Somewhere

672
01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:23,689
Somehow

673
01:28:24,635 --> 01:28:26,159
Someone

674
01:28:29,473 --> 01:28:30,997
Somewhere

675
01:28:31,909 --> 01:28:33,342
Somehow

676
01:28:34,278 --> 01:28:35,802
Someone

677
01:29:17,755 --> 01:29:19,222
Somewhere

678
01:29:20,057 --> 01:29:21,649
Somehow

679
01:29:22,526 --> 01:29:23,993
Someone

680
01:29:27,231 --> 01:29:28,789
Somewhere

681
01:29:29,767 --> 01:29:31,200
Somehow

682
01:29:32,102 --> 01:29:33,694
Someone

683
01:29:36,907 --> 01:29:38,465
Somewhere

684
01:29:39,443 --> 01:29:40,910
Somehow

685
01:29:41,879 --> 01:29:43,437
Someone

686
01:29:46,617 --> 01:29:48,141
Somewhere

687
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:50,609
Somehow

688
01:29:51,488 --> 01:29:53,080
Someone

689
01:29:56,226 --> 01:29:57,921
Somewhere

690
01:29:58,729 --> 01:30:00,253
Somehow

691
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:02,927
Someone

692
01:30:05,936 --> 01:30:07,699
Somewhere...
