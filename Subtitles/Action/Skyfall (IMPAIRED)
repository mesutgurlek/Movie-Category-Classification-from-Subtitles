1
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:26,811
<i>Ronson's down.</i>

2
00:01:26,996 --> 00:01:28,728
<i>He needs a Medical evacuation.</i>

3
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,322
<i>Where is it? Is it there?</i>

4
00:01:30,572 --> 00:01:32,653
<i>- Oh, the drive is gone.
- Are you sure?</i>

5
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:38,514
<i>It's gone.
Give me a minute.</i>

6
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,845
<i>They must have it.
Get off to them.</i>

7
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:47,879
<i>- I'm stabilizing Ronson.
- We don't have the time.</i>

8
00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:51,087
<i>- I have to stop the bleeding.
- Leave him!</i>

9
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,666
<i>Have you got him?</i>

10
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:29,957
<i>He is in the black Audi.</i>

11
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:32,930
<i>- What about Ronson.
- He's been hit.</i>

12
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:34,701
<i>I'm sending an emergency
evacuation squad.</i>

13
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:37,060
<i>Well, that'll be too bloody late.</i>

14
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:39,131
<i>Have they seen us?</i>

15
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:43,373
<i> Medical evacuation, for Ronson,
five minutes way.</i>

16
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:50,921
<i>It's all right?
You'll wait using it.</i>

17
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,390
<i>I wasn't using that one either.</i>

18
00:03:40,123 --> 00:03:41,605
<i>Keep your head down!</i>

19
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,628
<i>Just get clear!</i>

20
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:20,921
<i>Tanner, which way?</i>

21
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:22,912
<i>Keep going.
I can direct you from here.</i>

22
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:24,231
<i>We both know
what's at stake here.</i>

23
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,407
<i>We cannot afford
to lose that list.</i>

24
00:04:26,497 --> 00:04:27,775
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

25
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:58,283
<i>Where are they now?</i>

26
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:01,240
<i>They're on the top roof
of the grand bazaar.</i>

27
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:55,675
<i>Take the left, there's a bridge.
You can cut him off.</i>

28
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:49,723
<i>- What happened?
- They're on the train, ma' am.</i>

29
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:50,687
<i>What do you mean
on the train?</i>

30
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:52,249
<i>I mean they're on the top
of the train.</i>

31
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:54,455
<i>Well, get off to them,
for God's sake.</i>

32
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:25,370
<i>He's going out of range.</i>

33
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:26,944
<i>We've lost tracking.
We are blind here.</i>

34
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:28,711
<i>- What's going on?
- I'm still with them.</i>

35
00:07:28,835 --> 00:07:31,263
<i>There is CCTV satellite,
end of it.</i>

36
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:22,358
<i>What was that?</i>

37
00:08:22,988 --> 00:08:26,108
<i>VW Beetles, I think.</i>

38
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,172
<i>He's uncapping the cars.</i>

39
00:09:31,849 --> 00:09:35,489
<i>- 007, are you alright?
- Just changing carriages.</i>

40
00:09:37,195 --> 00:09:38,494
<i>What's going on?
Report!</i>

41
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,475
<i>It's rather hard
to explain, ma'am.</i>

42
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:43,037
<i>007 is saying proceed.</i>

43
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:50,932
<i>This side here isn't much more road.
I do not think I can go any further.</i>

44
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:27,711
<i>I may have a shot.</i>

45
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:35,536
<i>It's not clean.</i>

46
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:38,231
<i>Repeat.
I did not have a clean shot.</i>

47
00:11:44,952 --> 00:11:47,109
<i>There's a tunnel ahead.
I'm going to lose them.</i>

48
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:50,490
<i>- Can you get into a better position?
- Negative. There's no time.</i>

49
00:11:52,572 --> 00:11:53,550
<i>Take the shot.</i>

50
00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:57,193
<i>I said, "Take the shot!"</i>

51
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:00,519
<i>Well, I can't.
I may get Bond.</i>

52
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,262
<i>Take the bloody shot.</i>

53
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:25,358
<i>Agent down.</i>

54
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:41,285
<i>It's like going
into the headmaster study.</i>

55
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:43,540
<i>It's new chairman's
just a standard procedure.</i>

56
00:17:43,882 --> 00:17:46,243
<i>Bloody waste of my time,
that's what I'd call it.</i>

57
00:17:46,334 --> 00:17:48,174
<i>I'm sorry to have
to deal with such...</i>

58
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,051
<i>a delicate subject
at our first encounter...</i>

59
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,225
<i>But...</i>

60
00:17:54,984 --> 00:17:57,315
<i>I have to be frank with you.</i>

61
00:17:57,365 --> 00:17:59,647
<i>And it would be a good idea.</i>

62
00:18:02,185 --> 00:18:03,648
<i>The Prime Minister
is concerned.</i>

63
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:07,657
<i>You can tell him my operatives
are pursuing every avenue.</i>

64
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:09,501
<i>Have you considered
pulling up the agents?</i>

65
00:18:09,707 --> 00:18:10,987
<i>I've considered every option.</i>

66
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:13,259
<i>Forgive me,
but that sounds like an evasion.</i>

67
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:15,618
<i>Forgive me,
but why am I here?</i>

68
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:19,590
<i>Three months ago
you lost the computer drive</i>

69
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:22,526
<i>containing the identity
of almost every NATO agent</i>

70
00:18:22,576 --> 00:18:25,924
<i>embedded in terrorist organizations
across the globe.</i>

71
00:18:26,758 --> 00:18:28,652
<i>A list which,
in the eyes of our allies,</i>

72
00:18:28,677 --> 00:18:29,922
<i>never existed.</i>

73
00:18:29,972 --> 00:18:33,522
<i>So, if you'll forgive me,
I think you know why you're here.</i>

74
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,347
<i>How you should call it,
a civilian oversight?</i>

75
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:37,483
<i>No, what we call this is...</i>

76
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,657
<i>a retirement planning.</i>

77
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:43,000
<i>Your country has only
the highest respect for you</i>

78
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,021
<i>and your many years
of service.</i>

79
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:46,686
<i>When your current posting
is completed,</i>

80
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:49,070
<i>you'll be awarded to JCMG</i>

81
00:18:49,158 --> 00:18:50,796
<i>with full honours.</i>

82
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,477
<i>Congratulations.</i>

83
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:55,489
<i>You are firing me?</i>

84
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,634
<i>No, ma'am, I'm here to oversee
the transition period...</i>

85
00:18:57,709 --> 00:19:00,877
<i>leading to your voluntary retirement
in two months' time.</i>

86
00:19:01,102 --> 00:19:03,413
<i>Your successor has yet to be appointed,
so we'll be asking you...</i>

87
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:05,280
<i>I'm not an idiot, Mallory.</i>

88
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,831
<i>I know I can't do this job
forever.</i>

89
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,336
<i>But I'll be damned if I'm going
to leave the department</i>

90
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:12,509
<i>in worse shape than I found it.</i>

91
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:15,415
<i>M... you've had a great run.</i>

92
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:18,834
<i>- You should leave with dignity.
- Go to hell with dignity.</i>

93
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:22,670
<i>I'll leave when the job's done.</i>

94
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:40,732
<i>Yes?</i>

95
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,043
<i>Now?</i>

96
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:47,015
<i>Main alert from Q Robson,</i>

97
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,703
<i>trying to decrypt
the stolen hard drive.</i>

98
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:52,417
<i>We are tracing
the encryption signal.</i>

99
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,031
<i>Localizing now.</i>

100
00:19:56,422 --> 00:19:59,676
<i>It's sent here in the UK.</i>

101
00:20:00,146 --> 00:20:01,567
<i>London.</i>

102
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,399
<i>Get to inspect the basis
as soon as possible.</i>

103
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:13,409
<i>- It's coming from MI6.
- What?</i>

104
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:16,448
<i>The data back,
it is linking to our network.</i>

105
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,968
<i>Corrupted.
This is behind our firewall.</i>

106
00:20:19,104 --> 00:20:21,766
<i>- We should shut down.
- No, track it.</i>

107
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,473
<i>We have to know
where it's coming from.</i>

108
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:26,005
<i>Strip the head
and try the source.</i>

109
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:27,898
<i>How the hell
it entered in our system?</i>

110
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:30,110
<i>Get in trace right now.</i>

111
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:40,687
<i>- It is your computer, ma'am.
- Shut it down.</i>

112
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,211
<i>What is this?</i>

113
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:11,257
<i>For God's sake!</i>

114
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:14,194
<i>Just get out of the way.</i>

115
00:21:15,477 --> 00:21:16,967
<i>- Don't you recognize the car?
- Madam...</i>

116
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:44,648
<i>I'm going to find
whoever did this.</i>

117
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:35,449
<i>Where the hell
have you been?</i>

118
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:39,255
<i>Enjoying death.</i>

119
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:42,785
<i>007, reporting for duty.</i>

120
00:25:49,704 --> 00:25:51,416
<i>Why didn't you call?</i>

121
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:53,126
<i>Didn't you get the postcard?</i>

122
00:25:54,235 --> 00:25:55,191
<i>You should try it sometimes.</i>

123
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:58,128
<i>Get away from it all,
it really lends perspective.</i>

124
00:25:58,385 --> 00:26:00,855
<i>Run out of drink.
Were you awarded, eh?</i>

125
00:26:00,905 --> 00:26:01,948
<i>What it was you said?</i>

126
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:04,516
<i>Take the bloody shot.</i>

127
00:26:04,566 --> 00:26:06,528
<i>I made a judgement call.</i>

128
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:09,004
<i>You should have trusted me
to finish the job.</i>

129
00:26:09,054 --> 00:26:10,481
<i>It was the possibility
of losing you...</i>

130
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:13,520
<i>or the certainty of losing
all those other agents.</i>

131
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,452
<i>I made the only decision I could
and you know it.</i>

132
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:18,859
<i>I think you've lost your nerve.</i>

133
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:21,271
<i>What do you expect,
a bloody apology?</i>

134
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:24,816
<i>You know the rules of the game.
You've been playing it long enough.</i>

135
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,366
<i>- We both have.
- Maybe too long.</i>

136
00:26:29,077 --> 00:26:32,662
<i>Speak for yourself.</i>

137
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:34,974
<i>Ronson didn't make it, did he?</i>

138
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,277
<i>No.</i>

139
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:41,749
<i>So, this is it.</i>

140
00:26:42,636 --> 00:26:44,001
<i>We are both played out.</i>

141
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,895
<i>Well, if you believed that,
why did you come back?</i>

142
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,429
<i>Good question.</i>

143
00:26:51,188 --> 00:26:52,701
<i>Because we are
under attack...</i>

144
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,799
<i>and you know
we need you.</i>

145
00:27:01,236 --> 00:27:02,527
<i>Well, I'm here.</i>

146
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,369
<i>You'll have to be debriefed...</i>

147
00:27:05,462 --> 00:27:07,310
<i>and declared fit
for active service.</i>

148
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:11,401
<i>You're going to return to duty
when you've passed the tests.</i>

149
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:12,643
<i>So take them seriously.</i>

150
00:27:13,747 --> 00:27:15,717
<i>The shower
might be an order.</i>

151
00:27:16,616 --> 00:27:18,747
<i>I'm going home
and change.</i>

152
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:20,184
<i>Oh, we sold your flat.</i>

153
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:22,622
<i>Put your things
into storage.</i>

154
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:24,637
<i>Standard procedure...</i>

155
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,207
<i>on the death of an unmarried
employee with no next of kin.</i>

156
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,740
<i>You should have called.</i>

157
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,360
<i>I'll find a hotel.</i>

158
00:27:32,876 --> 00:27:34,997
<i>Well, you're bloody
will not sleep in here.</i>

159
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,827
<i>They attacked into the
environmental control system</i>

160
00:28:05,843 --> 00:28:09,095
<i>locked out the safety protocols
and have turned on the gas.</i>

161
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,930
<i>Well, that should
have been impossible.</i>

162
00:28:11,177 --> 00:28:13,528
<i>I was told that they have hacked
into our files.</i>

163
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:14,911
<i>They knew her appointments.</i>

164
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:17,165
<i>They knew she would be
out of the building.</i>

165
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:18,530
<i>They weren't targeting her.</i>

166
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,544
<i>They wanted us to see it.</i>

167
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:26,076
<i>- Where are we, lieutenant?
- New digs.</i>

168
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:36,558
<i>The old building was declared
strategically vulnerable.</i>

169
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,830
<i>That's putting it marvels.</i>

170
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:42,186
<i>Their aim is to breach the most secured
computer system in Britain.</i>

171
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:44,568
<i>So we are at war
with them now.</i>

172
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,421
<i>This is part of Churchill's bunker.</i>

173
00:28:47,471 --> 00:28:50,368
<i>Some of these tunnels
are dating back to the 18th century.</i>

174
00:28:50,386 --> 00:28:52,729
<i>Quite fascinating,
if it wasn't for the rats.</i>

175
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:55,576
<i>- When do I see M?
- Tomorrow, you'll see M...</i>

176
00:28:56,313 --> 00:28:58,544
<i>and Mallory too
if you're lucky.</i>

177
00:28:58,594 --> 00:28:59,233
<i>Who is Mallory?</i>

178
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:01,466
<i>The new chairman of the
Intelligence and Security Committee.</i>

179
00:29:01,813 --> 00:29:04,754
<i>A charming man, I think.
You and him will really going to hit it off.</i>

180
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:08,886
<i>Welcome to the new MI6.</i>

181
00:29:25,608 --> 00:29:27,851
<i>We've have attempted to trace
the computer message, but...</i>

182
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:31,152
<i>it was sent by an asymmetrical
security algorithm...</i>

183
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:33,036
<i>with the chance to signal
all over the globe</i>

184
00:29:33,088 --> 00:29:35,279
<i>through thousands
of different servers.</i>

185
00:29:35,346 --> 00:29:36,750
<i>And now that they've accessed
M's code,</i>

186
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,555
<i>it's only a matter of time before
they are able to decrypt the list.</i>

187
00:29:39,635 --> 00:29:43,019
<i>Q branch has been analyzing pictures.,
But so far, nothing.</i>

188
00:29:43,155 --> 00:29:45,372
<i>General feeling it's probably
something from her past</i>

189
00:29:45,664 --> 00:29:47,873
<i>Perhaps when she was
running things in Hong Kong.</i>

190
00:29:48,374 --> 00:29:51,606
<i>- It is no idea what it all means?
- And you believe that?</i>

191
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:54,684
<i>The truth is we don't have
a clue of what's on the list...</i>

192
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,864
<i>or what they are trying
to do with it.</i>

193
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:05,613
<i>We can always do this later.</i>

194
00:30:05,926 --> 00:30:09,314
<i>You know what?
Let's.</i>

195
00:31:15,738 --> 00:31:18,423
<i>I'd like to start with some
simple words' sensations.</i>

196
00:31:18,473 --> 00:31:21,107
<i>Just tell me the first word
that punch into your head.</i>

197
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,567
<i>For example I might day,
and you might say...</i>

198
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:25,593
<i>Wasted.</i>

199
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:30,985
<i>All right.</i>

200
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,331
<i>Gun.</i>

201
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:38,062
<i>Shot.</i>

202
00:31:38,112 --> 00:31:40,150
<i>- Agent.
- Provocative.</i>

203
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,596
<i>- Woman.
- Provocatrix.</i>

204
00:31:43,223 --> 00:31:45,725
<i>- Heart.
- Target.</i>

205
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:48,616
<i>- Bird.
- Sky.</i>

206
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:50,922
<i>- M.
- Bitch.</i>

207
00:31:53,907 --> 00:31:55,962
<i>- Sunlight.
- Swim.</i>

208
00:31:56,072 --> 00:31:57,699
<i>- Moonlight.
- Dance.</i>

209
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:03,688
<i>- Murder.
- Employment.</i>

210
00:32:04,011 --> 00:32:05,662
<i>- Country.
- England.</i>

211
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,680
<i>Skyfall.</i>

212
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,404
<i>Skyfall.</i>

213
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,977
<i>Done.</i>

214
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,124
<i>This is going well.</i>

215
00:33:09,915 --> 00:33:11,228
<i>Get these analyzed.</i>

216
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:14,366
<i>When arrives, on me.</i>

217
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:43,533
<i>She's ready for you.</i>

218
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:46,017
<i>I'm sorry.
Have we met before?</i>

219
00:33:47,499 --> 00:33:49,318
<i>I am the one
who should say "sorry".</i>

220
00:33:51,998 --> 00:33:53,346
<i>It was only four ribs.</i>

221
00:33:54,062 --> 00:33:55,938
<i>There's nonetheless
vital organs.</i>

222
00:33:57,932 --> 00:33:59,952
<i>Nothing major.</i>

223
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:06,544
<i>No enough excitement
in Istanbul?</i>

224
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,042
<i>I've been reassigned.</i>

225
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:10,407
<i>Temporary suspension
from field work.</i>

226
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:13,742
<i>- Really?
- Something to do with killing 007.</i>

227
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:17,574
<i>- Well, you gave it your best shot.
- It was hardly my best shot.</i>

228
00:34:18,226 --> 00:34:19,946
<i>I'm sure
I can survive your best.</i>

229
00:34:20,381 --> 00:34:22,134
<i>Time you'll get the chance.</i>

230
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,487
<i>Would you do me a favour,
will you?</i>

231
00:34:23,523 --> 00:34:25,619
<i>If they'll do let you back
out there...</i>

232
00:34:26,838 --> 00:34:28,740
<i>Warn me first.</i>

233
00:34:28,954 --> 00:34:31,543
<i>I'm assisting Gareth Mallory
in the transition...</i>

234
00:34:31,593 --> 00:34:33,795
<i>and then I'll be back
in the field.</i>

235
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:36,538
<i>- That's what you want?
- Yes, of course.</i>

236
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:39,814
<i>- This is not for everyone.
- Ah, 007...</i>

237
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,986
<i>It's this way.</i>

238
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:43,570
<i>In your defence...</i>

239
00:34:43,927 --> 00:34:46,615
<i>a moving target
is much harder to hit.</i>

240
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:51,011
<i>Then you better
keep moving.</i>

241
00:35:01,068 --> 00:35:04,857
<i>The whole office goes off in smoke
and that bloody thing survives.</i>

242
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:09,274
<i>Your interior decorating tips
have always been appreciated, 007.</i>

243
00:35:09,786 --> 00:35:11,889
<i>007, Gareth Mallory.</i>

244
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:15,340
<i>I hope I haven't miss anything
that P.M. does prattle in line of a crisis.</i>

245
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:18,046
<i>- Bond.
- Mallory.</i>

246
00:35:22,892 --> 00:35:25,040
<i>I have just been reviewing
Bond's tests.</i>

247
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:28,882
<i>Seems you passed.
Mind the scheme of your tiff?</i>

248
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:30,934
<i>You're back
on active service.</i>

249
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:34,799
<i>- Congratulations.
- Thank you.</i>

250
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:39,031
<i>- I'll be outside.
- I may have one question.</i>

251
00:35:40,462 --> 00:35:43,037
<i>Why not stay dead?</i>

252
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:45,508
<i>You have
the perfect way out.</i>

253
00:35:45,558 --> 00:35:47,229
<i>Go and live quietly
somewhere.</i>

254
00:35:47,672 --> 00:35:51,155
<i>Not many field agents
get to live this cleanly.</i>

255
00:35:51,205 --> 00:35:53,110
<i>Do you get out
in the field much?</i>

256
00:35:54,011 --> 00:35:56,724
<i>You don't need to be an operative
to see the obvious.</i>

257
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,824
<i>It's a young men's game.</i>

258
00:36:01,216 --> 00:36:02,378
<i>Look, you've been
seriously injured.</i>

259
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:04,930
<i>There's no shame in saying
you have lost a step.</i>

260
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:08,166
<i>The only shame, it would be
not admitting until it's too late.</i>

261
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:12,794
<i>I'm in, or fire me.
Entirely up to you.</i>

262
00:36:13,032 --> 00:36:14,964
<i>If he says he is ready,
he is ready.</i>

263
00:36:16,202 --> 00:36:18,293
<i>Perhaps
you can't see at all.</i>

264
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,122
<i>Maybe you will.</i>

265
00:36:19,172 --> 00:36:20,816
<i>What exactly
are you implying?</i>

266
00:36:21,275 --> 00:36:23,193
<i>You are sentimental
about him.</i>

267
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:25,887
<i>As long as I am the head
of this department,</i>

268
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:28,536
<i>I'll choose my own
operatives.</i>

269
00:36:30,285 --> 00:36:31,778
<i>Fair enough.</i>

270
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,592
<i>Good luck, 007.</i>

271
00:36:39,001 --> 00:36:41,125
<i>Don't cock it out.</i>

272
00:36:46,816 --> 00:36:49,751
<i>We've analyzed
these shrapnel fragments.</i>

273
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:53,611
<i>You're lucky it wasn't a direct hit.
It would have cut it you in half.</i>

274
00:36:53,939 --> 00:36:56,962
<i>It's a depleted uranium shell.
A military grade.</i>

275
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,981
<i>Hard to get,
extremely expensive</i>

276
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:03,750
<i>and only used by select few.</i>

277
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,192
<i>You recognize anyone?</i>

278
00:37:06,904 --> 00:37:08,226
<i>Him.</i>

279
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,324
<i>Okay, the name is Patrice.</i>

280
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,347
<i>He's a ghost.</i>

281
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,225
<i>An unknown resident
without country of origin.</i>

282
00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:15,818
<i>How do we find him?</i>

283
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:19,154
<i>Well, luckily I used to have one
or two friends left in the CIA.</i>

284
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:22,060
<i>They're after him for the Yemeni
ambassador's murder.</i>

285
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,343
<i>And they're getting close.</i>

286
00:37:23,393 --> 00:37:27,425
<i>Intel is he's going to be in Shanghai
in two days time. Probably a new job.</i>

287
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:30,005
<i>You have to go there
and wait further instructions.</i>

288
00:37:30,056 --> 00:37:32,030
<i>If he turns up, it's yours.</i>

289
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,345
<i>Find out who he worked for
and who has the list.</i>

290
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:39,134
<i>- Then, terminate him for Ronson.
- With pleasure.</i>

291
00:37:40,155 --> 00:37:43,367
<i>Is there anything else
you want to tell me?</i>

292
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,788
<i>No.</i>

293
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:48,703
<i>Report to the new quarter master
for a few documentation.</i>

294
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:52,606
<i>He hasn't set up sharp yet, but
Tanner will put you two together.</i>

295
00:37:52,656 --> 00:37:53,782
<i>Good luck.</i>

296
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:55,552
<i>Thank you.</i>

297
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,571
<i>007...</i>

298
00:38:02,604 --> 00:38:04,197
<i>You are ready for this?</i>

299
00:38:05,465 --> 00:38:06,797
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

300
00:38:10,572 --> 00:38:11,967
<i>I didn't know
Bond passed the tests.</i>

301
00:38:13,081 --> 00:38:14,750
<i>He didn't.</i>

302
00:38:44,174 --> 00:38:46,297
<i>Always makes me feel
a little melancholy.</i>

303
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,964
<i>A grand whole warship being
ignominiously hold the way to scrap.</i>

304
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,420
<i>Inevitability of time,
don't you think?</i>

305
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:00,127
<i>What do you see?</i>

306
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,784
<i>A bloody big ship.</i>

307
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:06,156
<i>Excuse me.</i>

308
00:39:06,616 --> 00:39:07,784
<i>007...</i>

309
00:39:09,157 --> 00:39:10,695
<i>I'm your new
Quarter master.</i>

310
00:39:12,656 --> 00:39:14,480
<i>You must be joking.</i>

311
00:39:15,205 --> 00:39:16,952
<i>Why, because I'm not wearing
a lab coat?</i>

312
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:19,428
<i>Because you still have spots.</i>

313
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:21,971
<i>My complexion
is hardly relevant.</i>

314
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:23,459
<i>And your confidence is.</i>

315
00:39:25,017 --> 00:39:26,770
<i>Age is no guarantee
of efficiency.</i>

316
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:29,285
<i>And youth is no guarantee
of innovation.</i>

317
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,345
<i>Oh, how's it I can do more damage
on my laptop</i>

318
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,247
<i>sitting in my pyjamas before
my first cup of Old Grey</i>

319
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,268
<i>than you could do
in a year in the field.</i>

320
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:38,951
<i>So why do you need me?</i>

321
00:39:40,273 --> 00:39:42,538
<i>Every now and then
a trigger has to be pulled.</i>

322
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,159
<i>Or not pulled.</i>

323
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,786
<i>It is hard to know which
in your pyjamas.</i>

324
00:39:52,158 --> 00:39:57,415
<i>- Q...
- 007.</i>

325
00:40:00,048 --> 00:40:01,920
<i>Ticket to Shanghai.</i>

326
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:04,173
<i>- Documentation and passport.
- Thank you.</i>

327
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:07,427
<i>And this.</i>

328
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,455
<i>Walter PPK, it's 9mm short.</i>

329
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:15,334
<i>There's a micro dermal sensor
in the grip...</i>

330
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,203
<i>encoded to your palm print,
so only you can fire it.</i>

331
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:23,548
<i>That's a random killing machine
more than a personal statement.</i>

332
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,559
<i>And this?</i>

333
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,415
<i>Standard as your
radio transmitter.</i>

334
00:40:29,822 --> 00:40:32,788
<i>Activated and broadcast
your own location.</i>

335
00:40:33,513 --> 00:40:34,758
<i>Distress it.</i>

336
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:39,428
<i>And that's it.</i>

337
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:43,567
<i>A gun, and a radio.</i>

338
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:47,603
<i>Not exactly Christmas, isn't it?</i>

339
00:40:48,715 --> 00:40:51,213
<i>Were you expecting
an exploding pen?</i>

340
00:40:52,861 --> 00:40:55,022
<i>We don't really go in
for that anymore.</i>

341
00:41:02,901 --> 00:41:04,531
<i>Good luck out there
on the field.</i>

342
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,928
<i>And please return
the equipment in one piece.</i>

343
00:41:13,316 --> 00:41:15,030
<i>Brave new world.</i>

344
00:49:35,963 --> 00:49:37,576
<i>Who got the list.</i>

345
00:49:42,171 --> 00:49:44,585
<i>Tell me, who you working for.</i>

346
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:16,432
<i>Tanner, he has posted
the first five names.</i>

347
00:51:17,293 --> 00:51:18,180
<i>Their cover is blown.</i>

348
00:51:18,595 --> 00:51:20,884
<i>They're in danger.
Get them out now.</i>

349
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:01,438
<i>Room service.</i>

350
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,942
<i>I didn't order anything.</i>

351
00:52:12,464 --> 00:52:13,600
<i>Not even you.</i>

352
00:52:13,843 --> 00:52:15,472
<i>I have got some
new information.</i>

353
00:52:16,554 --> 00:52:19,723
<i>Are not you a little too qualified
to be delivering messages?</i>

354
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:22,839
<i>It's all part
of the learning curve.</i>

355
00:52:23,242 --> 00:52:25,217
<i>And Q is afraid of flying.</i>

356
00:52:27,745 --> 00:52:31,624
<i>So, whoever stole the list
has already decrypted it.</i>

357
00:52:32,255 --> 00:52:34,746
<i>They posted the first five names
on the web.</i>

358
00:52:34,796 --> 00:52:38,187
<i>- It was only a matter of time.
- That should be the start.</i>

359
00:52:38,237 --> 00:52:41,579
<i>They're posting five more
next week and the week after.</i>

360
00:52:42,486 --> 00:52:44,658
<i>It's some kind of
sadistic game.</i>

361
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:51,071
<i>Cut through razor.</i>

362
00:52:52,709 --> 00:52:54,504
<i>How very traditional.</i>

363
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:58,873
<i>Well, I'm going to do some things
the old-fashion way.</i>

364
00:53:01,188 --> 00:53:03,808
<i>Sometimes the old ways
are the best.</i>

365
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,771
<i>Are you putting your life
in my hands again?</i>

366
00:53:19,468 --> 00:53:24,089
<i>Tans, already briefed me
on the list...</i>

367
00:53:25,544 --> 00:53:29,627
<i>raising the tantalizing question
of what you are really doing here.</i>

368
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:33,850
<i>The official directive
was to help...</i>

369
00:53:35,227 --> 00:53:38,639
<i>in any way I can.</i>

370
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:41,549
<i>Like spying for Mallory.</i>

371
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,498
<i>You know, Mallory
is not as bad as you think.</i>

372
00:53:47,073 --> 00:53:49,218
<i>He is a bureaucrat.</i>

373
00:53:49,776 --> 00:53:51,657
<i>You should do
your homework.</i>

374
00:53:52,598 --> 00:53:54,520
<i>Gareth Mallory
was Lieutenant Colonel...</i>

375
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:57,772
<i>Lieutenant Colonel in Northern
Ireland Herford regiment.</i>

376
00:53:57,822 --> 00:54:00,457
<i>He spent three months
at the hands of the IRA.</i>

377
00:54:02,012 --> 00:54:04,487
<i>So there's more to him
that meets the eye.</i>

378
00:54:07,638 --> 00:54:09,124
<i>We'll see.</i>

379
00:54:10,832 --> 00:54:12,343
<i>Keep still.</i>

380
00:54:14,574 --> 00:54:17,174
<i>This is the tricky part.</i>

381
00:54:28,669 --> 00:54:30,624
<i>That's better.</i>

382
00:54:31,479 --> 00:54:34,375
<i>- You know the part now.
- Mmh, mmh.</i>

383
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:38,052
<i>And what part is that?</i>

384
00:54:40,227 --> 00:54:41,590
<i>Old dog...</i>

385
00:54:42,621 --> 00:54:44,910
<i>new tricks.</i>

386
00:55:56,526 --> 00:55:57,764
<i>Good evening.</i>

387
00:55:58,268 --> 00:55:59,490
<i>Good evening.</i>

388
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,602
<i>Don't you touch your ear.</i>

389
00:56:02,689 --> 00:56:04,151
<i>There are three exits.</i>

390
00:56:05,456 --> 00:56:07,475
<i>And lots of blind spots.</i>

391
00:56:08,027 --> 00:56:09,949
<i>I've got them covered.</i>

392
00:56:15,819 --> 00:56:17,251
<i>You look beautiful
in that dress.</i>

393
00:56:18,222 --> 00:56:19,454
<i>You could scrub out
about yourself.</i>

394
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:22,682
<i>It's amazing what one could do
with an extra pair of hands.</i>

395
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,592
<i>You're telling mean.</i>

396
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,422
<i>You gamble?</i>

397
00:56:27,944 --> 00:56:30,417
<i>Don't like you a little flatten
now and then?</i>

398
00:56:32,403 --> 00:56:34,808
<i>He doesn't like
to take chances.</i>

399
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,212
<i>Good evening, sir.
How may I help you?</i>

400
00:56:42,362 --> 00:56:44,131
<i>I'd like to cash this in,
please.</i>

401
00:56:51,061 --> 00:56:52,430
<i>One moment, sir.</i>

402
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:27,080
<i>Good fortune tonight, sir.</i>

403
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,377
<i>Let's hope so.</i>

404
00:57:43,221 --> 00:57:45,205
<i>With compliments
of the house.</i>

405
00:57:46,082 --> 00:57:47,669
<i>Thank you.</i>

406
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:09,802
<i>Now you can afford
to buy me a drink?</i>

407
00:58:12,362 --> 00:58:14,886
<i>Maybe I could give
a stretch or two.</i>

408
00:58:16,233 --> 00:58:19,168
<i>I guess I got good
4 million Euros in here.</i>

409
00:58:19,634 --> 00:58:20,803
<i>Not bad.</i>

410
00:58:20,928 --> 00:58:23,854
<i>- I like this game.
- Why don't we play another?</i>

411
00:58:24,995 --> 00:58:26,464
<i>I don't gamble.</i>

412
00:58:29,962 --> 00:58:31,630
<i>I'm not very lucky.</i>

413
00:58:32,067 --> 00:58:34,478
<i>With lucky old friend
in Shanghai.</i>

414
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:41,351
<i>I've been waiting to see
who'll redeem the chip.</i>

415
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:45,575
<i>You made such a gold entrance
into our little drama.</i>

416
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:47,878
<i>Do I have
a complicated plot?</i>

417
00:58:49,011 --> 00:58:51,248
<i>Who doesn’t appreciate
the occasion of twists?</i>

418
00:58:51,716 --> 00:58:56,157
<i>- Mr...
- Bond. James Bond.</i>

419
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:59,734
<i>Severing,
so Mr. Bond...</i>

420
00:58:59,784 --> 00:59:03,206
<i>shall we discuss your next
performance with all that drink?</i>

421
00:59:03,411 --> 00:59:04,975
<i>Not bad.</i>

422
00:59:07,766 --> 00:59:11,135
<i>Are your friends
be joining us?</i>

423
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:15,140
<i>I'm afraid... it's inevitable.</i>

424
00:59:18,575 --> 00:59:20,816
<i>- She's pretty.
- No, no.</i>

425
00:59:20,874 --> 00:59:23,902
<i>Do you like that ass,
don't you think?</i>

426
00:59:23,952 --> 00:59:25,425
<i>Well, I'll keep you posted.</i>

427
00:59:37,065 --> 00:59:38,362
<i>Perfect.</i>

428
00:59:40,697 --> 00:59:43,388
<i>Would you mind if I ask you
a business question?</i>

429
00:59:44,974 --> 00:59:47,688
<i>Depends on the question.</i>

430
00:59:47,738 --> 00:59:50,404
<i>It has to do with... death.</i>

431
00:59:51,305 --> 00:59:53,516
<i>A subject in which
you're well versed.</i>

432
00:59:54,342 --> 00:59:56,349
<i>How would you know that?</i>

433
00:59:57,496 --> 01:00:00,404
<i>Only a certain kind of woman
wears a backless dress</i>

434
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:03,436
<i>with a Beretta .70
strapped to her thigh.</i>

435
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,703
<i>One could never be
too careful when...</i>

436
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:09,706
<i>a handsome man in tuxedos
carry Walters...</i>

437
01:00:12,244 --> 01:00:15,176
<i>I'm correct in assuming
you'll killed Patrice?</i>

438
01:00:16,383 --> 01:00:17,565
<i>Yes.</i>

439
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,064
<i>Might I ask why?</i>

440
01:00:22,387 --> 01:00:24,517
<i>I want to meet
your employer.</i>

441
01:00:36,623 --> 01:00:40,166
<i>Be careful
what you wish for.</i>

442
01:00:40,664 --> 01:00:42,095
<i>You are scared.</i>

443
01:00:43,212 --> 01:00:45,241
<i>Thank you
for the drink...</i>

444
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:48,392
<i>Mr. Bond.</i>

445
01:00:56,325 --> 01:00:58,013
<i>You put on a good show.</i>

446
01:01:00,345 --> 01:01:01,793
<i>But ever since
we sat down here</i>

447
01:01:02,015 --> 01:01:04,790
<i>you haven't stop looking
at your bodyguards.</i>

448
01:01:06,268 --> 01:01:08,529
<i>The three of them
have been excessive.</i>

449
01:01:09,007 --> 01:01:10,720
<i>They're controlling you.</i>

450
01:01:11,214 --> 01:01:12,628
<i>They're not protecting you.</i>

451
01:01:14,817 --> 01:01:16,120
<i>Tattoo on your wrist...</i>

452
01:01:16,688 --> 01:01:18,125
<i>is Macao's sex trade..</i>

453
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:21,286
<i>You belonged to one of the houses
when were you, 12?</i>

454
01:01:21,859 --> 01:01:23,452
<i>13?</i>

455
01:01:24,391 --> 01:01:26,405
<i>I can see images
of a way out.</i>

456
01:01:27,194 --> 01:01:29,797
<i>I hope she told
you were in love.</i>

457
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:33,842
<i>But that was a long time ago.</i>

458
01:01:35,964 --> 01:01:38,011
<i>You know nothing about it.</i>

459
01:01:38,539 --> 01:01:42,005
<i>Right, when a woman is afraid
and pretending not to be.</i>

460
01:01:45,223 --> 01:01:47,200
<i>How much do you know
about fear?</i>

461
01:01:47,761 --> 01:01:50,019
<i>All there is.</i>

462
01:01:50,824 --> 01:01:52,624
<i>Not like this.</i>

463
01:01:53,392 --> 01:01:58,255
<i>And... not like him.</i>

464
01:01:58,305 --> 01:01:59,764
<i>I can help you.</i>

465
01:02:00,603 --> 01:02:03,371
<i>- I don't think so.
- Let me try.</i>

466
01:02:05,657 --> 01:02:06,982
<i>How?</i>

467
01:02:08,018 --> 01:02:09,668
<i>Bring me to him.</i>

468
01:02:12,344 --> 01:02:16,006
<i>- Can you kill him?
- Yes.</i>

469
01:02:16,313 --> 01:02:20,012
<i>- Will you?
- Someone usually dies.</i>

470
01:02:24,648 --> 01:02:28,022
<i>Perhaps you can.</i>

471
01:02:34,268 --> 01:02:36,281
<i>When I leave,
they're going to kill you.</i>

472
01:02:37,573 --> 01:02:40,274
<i>If you survive,
I'm on the Caimira.</i>

473
01:02:40,754 --> 01:02:41,941
<i>North Harbour...</i>

474
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:44,463
<i>Berth 7.</i>

475
01:02:45,616 --> 01:02:49,007
<i>We cast off in an hour.</i>

476
01:02:53,324 --> 01:02:55,732
<i>Very nice to have met you,
Mr. Bond.</i>

477
01:02:57,384 --> 01:02:58,794
<i>Good luck.</i>

478
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,263
<i>Good luck with that.</i>

479
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:51,670
<i>Thank you.</i>

480
01:04:56,379 --> 01:04:58,573
<i>Put it all on red.</i>

481
01:05:00,698 --> 01:05:03,030
<i>That's the circle of life.</i>

482
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:28,295
<i>Yes?</i>

483
01:05:31,906 --> 01:05:34,994
<i>It's time to cast off.</i>

484
01:05:35,594 --> 01:05:37,034
<i>All right.</i>

485
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:35,041
<i>I like you better
without putting you on red.</i>

486
01:06:38,809 --> 01:06:42,861
<i>I feel naked without it.</i>

487
01:06:58,275 --> 01:06:58,965
<i>Good evening.</i>

488
01:06:59,089 --> 01:07:00,832
<i>The controversy surrounding
the Ministry of Defence...</i>

489
01:07:00,957 --> 01:07:02,415
<i>has escalated today</i>

490
01:07:02,661 --> 01:07:06,330
<i>as images of the Hussein
assassination continue to circulate.</i>

491
01:07:06,587 --> 01:07:10,100
<i>We should warn you, some viewers
might find these images disturbing.</i>

492
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:15,061
<i>Captain Hussein, an MI6 operative
embedded in the Middle East</i>

493
01:07:15,269 --> 01:07:18,803
<i>was one of the five agents exposed
in what is now been considered</i>

494
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:22,844
<i>the greatest internal security breach
in modern British history.</i>

495
01:07:23,115 --> 01:07:26,746
<i>The Prime Minister continues
to express public support for MI6</i>

496
01:07:27,158 --> 01:07:29,104
<i>while the opposition has taken
the position...</i>

497
01:07:29,154 --> 01:07:31,723
<i>has taken the position where a bunch
of antiquate bloody idiots</i>

498
01:07:31,875 --> 01:07:35,054
<i>are fighting a war we don't understand
and can't possibly win.</i>

499
01:07:35,512 --> 01:07:37,680
<i>Look, three of my agents
are dead already.</i>

500
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,921
<i>Don't you bring me
in politics now.</i>

501
01:07:39,946 --> 01:07:41,196
<i>The Prime Minister
has ordered an enquiry.</i>

502
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:42,768
<i>You'll have to appear.</i>

503
01:07:42,817 --> 01:07:46,326
<i>Standing in the stocks of midday?
Who is antiquated now?</i>

504
01:07:46,351 --> 01:07:48,528
<i>For Christ sake, listen to yourself.
We are a democracy</i>

505
01:07:48,529 --> 01:07:51,060
<i>and are accountable to the people
we are trying to defend.</i>

506
01:07:51,085 --> 01:07:52,506
<i>We can't keep working
in the shadows.</i>

507
01:07:52,557 --> 01:07:54,894
<i>There are no more shadows.</i>

508
01:07:54,919 --> 01:07:56,746
<i>You don't get this, do you.</i>

509
01:07:57,597 --> 01:08:00,501
<i>Whoever is behind this,
whoever is doing it, he knows us.</i>

510
01:08:01,194 --> 01:08:02,308
<i>He is one of us.</i>

511
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,425
<i>He comes from
the same place as Bond.</i>

512
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:07,007
<i>The place you say
doesn't exist.</i>

513
01:08:07,549 --> 01:08:09,309
<i>The shadows.</i>

514
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:48,276
<i>It's not too late.</i>

515
01:09:34,747 --> 01:09:36,979
<i>They abandoned it
almost in the night.</i>

516
01:09:38,446 --> 01:09:41,837
<i>He made them think there was
a leak at the chemical plant.</i>

517
01:09:43,271 --> 01:09:47,212
<i>It is amazing the panic you can
cause with a single computer.</i>

518
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,613
<i>He wanted the island.</i>

519
01:09:49,732 --> 01:09:51,639
<i>So he took it.</i>

520
01:09:52,692 --> 01:09:54,811
<i>Does he always get
what he wants?</i>

521
01:09:55,968 --> 01:09:57,853
<i>More than you know.</i>

522
01:10:01,563 --> 01:10:02,783
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

523
01:10:31,208 --> 01:10:34,138
<i>Hello, James.
Welcome.</i>

524
01:10:34,484 --> 01:10:35,989
<i>You like the island?</i>

525
01:10:39,563 --> 01:10:41,099
<i>My grandmother
had an island.</i>

526
01:10:41,701 --> 01:10:42,825
<i>Nothing to boast off.</i>

527
01:10:43,204 --> 01:10:44,907
<i>You could walk along
within an hour.</i>

528
01:10:45,146 --> 01:10:47,583
<i>But still it was,
it was a paradise for us.</i>

529
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:51,154
<i>One summer,
we went for a visit...</i>

530
01:10:51,386 --> 01:10:55,001
<i>and discovered the place
had been infested with rats.</i>

531
01:10:55,732 --> 01:10:59,244
<i>They'd come on a fishing boat
and gorged themselves on coconut.</i>

532
01:11:00,334 --> 01:11:03,852
<i>So, how do you get rid
of the rats on an island?</i>

533
01:11:03,902 --> 01:11:05,122
<i>My grandmother showed me.</i>

534
01:11:06,279 --> 01:11:08,846
<i>We buried an whole drum
and changed the lead.</i>

535
01:11:09,146 --> 01:11:11,139
<i>Then we wired the coconut
to the lead as bait...</i>

536
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:15,026
<i>and the rats will come
for the coconut, and...</i>

537
01:11:15,317 --> 01:11:16,804
<i>They would fall
into the drum.</i>

538
01:11:18,047 --> 01:11:22,144
<i>And after a month
you've trapped all the rats.</i>

539
01:11:22,389 --> 01:11:25,007
<i>But what did you do then?</i>

540
01:11:25,057 --> 01:11:27,060
<i>Throw the drum
into the ocean?</i>

541
01:11:27,769 --> 01:11:29,917
<i>Burn it? No...</i>

542
01:11:30,485 --> 01:11:32,178
<i>You just leave it...</i>

543
01:11:33,445 --> 01:11:35,761
<i>and they begin
to get hungry.</i>

544
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:40,439
<i>And one by one...</i>

545
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:42,505
<i>they start
eating each other...</i>

546
01:11:42,555 --> 01:11:46,299
<i>until there are only two left,
the two survivors.</i>

547
01:11:46,676 --> 01:11:48,889
<i>And then what,
do you kill them? No.</i>

548
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:52,658
<i>You take them
and release them into the trees.</i>

549
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:55,622
<i>And now they don't eat
coconut anymore.</i>

550
01:11:56,314 --> 01:11:58,720
<i>Now they only eat rat.</i>

551
01:11:59,947 --> 01:12:02,511
<i>You have changed
their nature.</i>

552
01:12:04,454 --> 01:12:05,864
<i>The two survivors.</i>

553
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:09,104
<i>This is what you made us.</i>

554
01:12:11,137 --> 01:12:13,234
<i>I made my own choices.</i>

555
01:12:14,203 --> 01:12:15,826
<i>You think you did.</i>

556
01:12:16,894 --> 01:12:18,456
<i>That's sheer genius.</i>

557
01:12:20,463 --> 01:12:21,952
<i>Station H.</i>

558
01:12:22,865 --> 01:12:24,548
<i>Am I right, Hong Kong?</i>

559
01:12:25,742 --> 01:12:27,866
<i>'86 to '97.</i>

560
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,802
<i>Back then,
I was her favourite.</i>

561
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:32,729
<i>And you're not nearly
the agent I was.</i>

562
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:34,450
<i>I can tell you that.</i>

563
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:37,069
<i>Just look at you.</i>

564
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:40,265
<i>Barely held together
by your pills, and your drink.</i>

565
01:12:40,266 --> 01:12:42,922
<i>Don't forget my pathetic
love of country.</i>

566
01:12:45,003 --> 01:12:47,931
<i>You're still clinging to your faith
in that old woman</i>

567
01:12:48,804 --> 01:12:51,312
<i>- when all she does is lie to you.
- She never lied lied to me.</i>

568
01:12:51,362 --> 01:12:53,233
<i>- No?
- No.</i>

569
01:12:53,406 --> 01:12:55,477
<i>What do you score on your
maximum ship evaluation?</i>

570
01:12:55,478 --> 01:12:57,233
<i>70.</i>

571
01:12:57,984 --> 01:12:59,530
<i>40.</i>

572
01:13:01,538 --> 01:13:03,808
<i>Did she tell you the psychologist
cleaned you for duty?</i>

573
01:13:03,809 --> 01:13:05,079
<i>- Yes.
- No.</i>

574
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:06,581
<i>No.</i>

575
01:13:15,191 --> 01:13:17,135
<i>Medical evaluation; Fail.</i>

576
01:13:17,216 --> 01:13:19,170
<i>Physical evolution; Fail.</i>

577
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:25,241
<i>Psychological evaluation, alcohol
and substance addiction indicated.</i>

578
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,577
<i>Pathological rejection
of authority</i>

579

<i>based on unresolved
childhood trauma.</i>

<i>Subject is not approved
for field duty</i>

581
01:13:40,363 --> 01:13:43,559
<i>and immediate suspension
from service advised.</i>

582
01:13:43,648 --> 01:13:45,664
<i>What is this,
if not betrayal?</i>

583
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:48,570
<i>She send you off to me,
knowing that you're not ready</i>

584
01:13:48,582 --> 01:13:49,794
<i>knowing you will likely die.</i>

585
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:52,683
<i>Mommy was very bad.</i>

586
01:14:16,488 --> 01:14:18,567
<i>See what she's done to you?</i>

587
01:14:19,643 --> 01:14:22,917
<i>Well, she never tied me
to a chair.</i>

588
01:14:22,968 --> 01:14:27,352
<i>I loss.</i>

589
01:14:28,109 --> 01:14:30,514
<i>Are you sure
this is about her?</i>

590
01:14:30,618 --> 01:14:32,256
<i>It's about her...</i>

591
01:14:32,823 --> 01:14:35,428
<i>and you and me.</i>

592
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,679
<i>You see,
we are last two rats.</i>

593
01:14:39,442 --> 01:14:41,358
<i>We can either
eat each other.</i>

594
01:14:48,707 --> 01:14:50,256
<i>Or eat everyone else.</i>

595
01:14:52,846 --> 01:14:56,376
<i>How you're trying to remember
your training now?</i>

596
01:14:57,810 --> 01:15:00,476
<i>What's the regulation
to cover this?</i>

597
01:15:03,636 --> 01:15:06,033
<i>Well, first time
for everything.</i>

598
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:07,635
<i>Yes.</i>

599
01:15:09,804 --> 01:15:12,728
<i>What makes you think
this is my first time?</i>

600
01:15:13,854 --> 01:15:17,726
<i>Oh, Mr. Bond...</i>

601
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:22,133
<i>All the physical stuff's so dull.
So dull.</i>

602
01:15:25,128 --> 01:15:26,467
<i>Changing spies.</i>

603
01:15:27,037 --> 01:15:28,796
<i>So old-fashioned.</i>

604
01:15:31,906 --> 01:15:33,699
<i>Your knees
must be killing you.</i>

605
01:15:38,619 --> 01:15:39,797
<i>England...</i>

606
01:15:40,664 --> 01:15:43,117
<i>the Empire, MI6.</i>

607
01:15:43,529 --> 01:15:45,358
<i>You're living
in the ruins as well.</i>

608
01:15:45,789 --> 01:15:47,252
<i>You just don't know it yet.</i>

609
01:15:48,567 --> 01:15:51,084
<i>At least here there are no
old ladies giving orders...</i>

610
01:15:51,294 --> 01:15:54,073
<i>and no little...</i>

611
01:15:55,327 --> 01:15:58,120
<i>gadgets from those fools
in Q print.</i>

612
01:16:00,751 --> 01:16:01,939
<i>If you'd want it,</i>

613
01:16:02,536 --> 01:16:04,914
<i>you could pick
your own secret missions...</i>

614
01:16:04,964 --> 01:16:06,890
<i>as I do.</i>

615
01:16:07,942 --> 01:16:08,918
<i>Name it.</i>

616
01:16:10,242 --> 01:16:11,859
<i>Name it.</i>

617
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:18,638
<i>You destabilize a multinational
by manipulating stocks. Easy.</i>

618
01:16:19,574 --> 01:16:23,191
<i>Interrupt transmission
from a spy satellite over Kabul.</i>

619
01:16:23,226 --> 01:16:24,792
<i>Done.</i>

620
01:16:24,842 --> 01:16:28,804
<i>Rig an election in Uganda.
All to the highest bidder.</i>

621
01:16:28,963 --> 01:16:30,920
<i>Or a gas explosion in London.</i>

622
01:16:32,351 --> 01:16:34,429
<i>Guess the point, angelic.</i>

623
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:37,822
<i>Well, everyone needs a hobby.</i>

624
01:16:41,975 --> 01:16:44,840
<i>So what's yours?</i>

625
01:16:46,186 --> 01:16:49,851
<i>Resurrection.</i>

626
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:53,681
<i>Let me show you something.</i>

627
01:17:06,241 --> 01:17:09,050
<i>Tells a story, doesn't it?</i>

628
01:17:12,181 --> 01:17:14,006
<i>They left the island so quickly</i>

629
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:18,041
<i>that couldn't decide what to take
what to leave, what was important.</i>

630
01:17:18,808 --> 01:17:22,240
<i>And this every day reminds me
to focus on the essentials.</i>

631
01:17:22,574 --> 01:17:26,457
<i>There is nothing...
nothing superfluous in my life.</i>

632
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,099
<i>When a thing is redundant,
it is... eliminated.</i>

633
01:17:40,483 --> 01:17:42,106
<i>Fifty years old McClellan.</i>

634
01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:45,760
<i>A particular favourite of yours,
I understand?</i>

635
01:17:48,082 --> 01:17:50,749
<i>So... what's the toast?</i>

636
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:55,697
<i>To the women we love?</i>

637
01:18:06,205 --> 01:18:07,139
<i>Darling...</i>

638
01:18:08,497 --> 01:18:11,439
<i>Darling,
your love is out here.</i>

639
01:18:11,725 --> 01:18:12,680
<i>No, no, no, no...</i>

640
01:18:13,746 --> 01:18:15,868
<i>Stand up straight,
keep still...</i>

641
01:18:18,016 --> 01:18:19,402
<i>and whatever you do,
don't lose your head.</i>

642
01:18:19,793 --> 01:18:22,642
<i>Don't lose your head.</i>

643
01:18:24,932 --> 01:18:26,533
<i>Don't lose your head.</i>

644
01:18:27,844 --> 01:18:30,827
<i>Time to redeem
your maximum ship scores.</i>

645
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:33,762
<i>Let's see.</i>

646
01:18:39,671 --> 01:18:40,866
<i>You can be the first...</i>

647
01:18:41,844 --> 01:18:44,643
<i>to knock the gloss
from her head.</i>

648
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:53,113
<i>And just to be sporting,
I'll let you go first.</i>

649
01:19:11,177 --> 01:19:12,914
<i>Let's see
who it's up on top.</i>

650
01:19:26,234 --> 01:19:27,901
<i>Oh, can't believe it.</i>

651
01:19:28,544 --> 01:19:30,241
<i>Can't believe it.</i>

652
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:32,248
<i>Did you really die that day?</i>

653
01:19:32,945 --> 01:19:36,977
<i>Is there any,
any of the old 007 left?</i>

654
01:19:45,539 --> 01:19:47,003
<i>My turn.</i>

655
01:19:50,532 --> 01:19:53,177
<i>I win.
What do you say to that?</i>

656
01:19:56,759 --> 01:19:58,133
<i>So waste of good scotch.</i>

657
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:10,569
<i>What are you
going to do now?</i>

658
01:20:10,755 --> 01:20:13,192
<i>Take me back to her?
All on your own?</i>

659
01:20:13,805 --> 01:20:15,704
<i>Who says
I'm on my own?</i>

660
01:20:34,583 --> 01:20:36,361
<i>Latest thing
from Q branch.</i>

661
01:20:37,656 --> 01:20:39,504
<i>On the radio.</i>

662
01:21:34,857 --> 01:21:36,979
<i>You are smaller
then I remembered.</i>

663
01:21:38,233 --> 01:21:40,444
<i>Well, as I bet you remember
you were tall.</i>

664
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:44,036
<i>Strange, for me it feels just...
like yesterday.</i>

665
01:21:45,948 --> 01:21:48,788
<i>- Are you surprised?
- Not particularly.</i>

666
01:21:48,871 --> 01:21:51,131
<i>But then you always were
a slippery one.</i>

667
01:21:51,293 --> 01:21:53,736
<i>Maybe that's why
you liked me so much.</i>

668
01:21:53,786 --> 01:21:57,476
<i>- You flatter yourself.
- No remorse.</i>

669
01:21:59,302 --> 01:22:01,676
<i>Just as I can imagine it.</i>

670
01:22:02,261 --> 01:22:04,511
<i>Regret is unprofessional.</i>

671
01:22:10,744 --> 01:22:11,898
<i>"Regret is unprofessional"...</i>

672
01:22:12,186 --> 01:22:16,164
<i>They kept for five months
in a room with no air.</i>

673
01:22:16,214 --> 01:22:17,055
<i>They tortured me.</i>

674
01:22:17,822 --> 01:22:20,990
<i>And I isn’t protected your secrets.
I protected you.</i>

675
01:22:21,973 --> 01:22:23,651
<i>But they made me suffer...</i>

676
01:22:23,886 --> 01:22:25,292
<i>and suffer...</i>

677
01:22:26,745 --> 01:22:28,356
<i>and suffer.</i>

678
01:22:29,503 --> 01:22:31,171
<i>Until I realized...</i>

679
01:22:32,917 --> 01:22:35,547
<i>it was you...
who betrayed me.</i>

680
01:22:36,631 --> 01:22:38,350
<i>You betrayed me.</i>

681
01:22:39,736 --> 01:22:42,659
<i>So I had only one thing left.</i>

682
01:22:44,539 --> 01:22:48,161
<i>My cyanide capsule
in my back lift molar.</i>

683
01:22:48,211 --> 01:22:51,212
<i>You remember, right?</i>

684
01:22:54,358 --> 01:22:56,114
<i>So I broke the tooth...</i>

685
01:22:57,481 --> 01:23:00,158
<i>and bit into the capsule.</i>

686
01:23:04,856 --> 01:23:07,018
<i>Burned all my insights...</i>

687
01:23:07,985 --> 01:23:09,511
<i>but I didn't die.</i>

688
01:23:13,006 --> 01:23:15,228
<i>Life clamed to me
like a disease.</i>

689
01:23:20,224 --> 01:23:21,286
<i>And then...</i>

690
01:23:21,506 --> 01:23:22,934
<i>I understood...</i>

691
01:23:23,167 --> 01:23:25,275
<i>why I had survived.</i>

692
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:31,846
<i>I needed to look in your eyes
one last time.</i>

693
01:23:35,169 --> 01:23:37,318
<i>Well, I hope it was worth it.</i>

694
01:23:39,342 --> 01:23:40,533
<i>Mr. Silva...</i>

695
01:23:40,566 --> 01:23:42,830
<i>you are going to be transferred
to Belmarsh Prison...</i>

696
01:23:42,909 --> 01:23:44,988
<i>where you will be remanded
in custody...</i>

697
01:23:45,595 --> 01:23:48,892
<i>until the Crown prosecution service
deem you fit to stand trial...</i>

698
01:23:49,543 --> 01:23:52,040
<i>Say my name.
Say it.</i>

699
01:23:52,058 --> 01:23:53,586
<i>My real name.</i>

700
01:23:54,815 --> 01:23:56,521
<i>I know you remember it.</i>

701
01:23:57,718 --> 01:24:02,011
<i>Your name is on the memorial wall
of the very building you attacked.</i>

702
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:04,530
<i>I will have it struck off.</i>

703
01:24:05,131 --> 01:24:09,780
<i>Soon, your past will be
as non-existent as your future.</i>

704
01:24:10,273 --> 01:24:12,182
<i>I'll never see you again.</i>

705
01:24:15,104 --> 01:24:17,180
<i>Did you know
what it does to you?</i>

706
01:24:19,331 --> 01:24:21,622
<i>Hydrogen cyanide?</i>

707
01:24:33,994 --> 01:24:36,883
<i>Look at what you've done,</i>

708
01:24:37,627 --> 01:24:39,390
<i>Mother...</i>

709
01:25:17,556 --> 01:25:19,615
<i>Let's me know what you recover
from its computers.</i>

710
01:25:19,755 --> 01:25:21,591
<i>Has he transmitted the list?
If such, to who.</i>

711
01:25:21,859 --> 01:25:24,394
<i>- I want this resolved.
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

712
01:25:30,765 --> 01:25:32,695
<i>His name is
Tiago Rodriguez.</i>

713
01:25:33,906 --> 01:25:35,510
<i>He was a brilliant agent.</i>

714
01:25:36,398 --> 01:25:39,930
<i>But he started operating beyond
his brief hacking the Chinese.</i>

715
01:25:40,261 --> 01:25:42,979
<i>The hand over was coming up
and they were hunting him, so...</i>

716
01:25:43,002 --> 01:25:44,135
<i>I gave him up.</i>

717
01:25:44,321 --> 01:25:45,813
<i>I got six agents in return...</i>

718
01:25:46,405 --> 01:25:47,988
<i>and a peaceful transition.</i>

719
01:25:48,013 --> 01:25:50,275
<i>We should go, ma'am.
Board enquiry begins in 30-minutes.</i>

720
01:25:51,282 --> 01:25:53,533
<i>I want to know
what's on that computer.</i>

721
01:26:06,363 --> 01:26:08,765
<i>Now, looking
at Silva's computer...</i>

722
01:26:09,499 --> 01:26:12,732
<i>it seems to me he's done a number
of slightly unusual things.</i>

723
01:26:13,283 --> 01:26:15,103
<i>It's established
failed saved protocols...</i>

724
01:26:15,289 --> 01:26:18,456
<i>to wipe the memory if there's
any attempt to access certain files.</i>

725
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,359
<i>Only about six people in the world
can program safe guides like that.</i>

726
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,522
<i>Of course there are.
Can you get past them?</i>

727
01:26:25,353 --> 01:26:27,074
<i>I invented them.</i>

728
01:26:30,261 --> 01:26:31,689
<i>Right then.</i>

729
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:36,480
<i>Let's see what you got for us...
Mr. Silva.</i>

730
01:26:38,614 --> 01:26:40,286
<i>We're in.</i>

731
01:26:46,173 --> 01:26:47,016
<i>Sir...</i>

732
01:26:47,245 --> 01:26:48,760
<i>What do you make of this?</i>

733
01:26:54,072 --> 01:26:55,696
<i>This is Omega site.</i>

734
01:26:56,591 --> 01:26:58,628
<i>What encrypted level it has.</i>

735
01:27:00,223 --> 01:27:03,191
<i>Looks like overstated code
to consider its true purpose.</i>

736
01:27:05,052 --> 01:27:07,301
<i>Security through obscurity.</i>

737
01:27:08,744 --> 01:27:10,865
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
if I might have order.</i>

738
01:27:12,564 --> 01:27:14,393
<i>I'd like to begin
the proceedings.</i>

739
01:27:16,179 --> 01:27:18,722
<i>We are gathered today
to adjust some important issues</i>

740
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:22,191
<i>concerning the future
of our national security.</i>

741
01:27:27,703 --> 01:27:29,709
<i>Going somewhere?</i>

742
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:35,459
<i>So you believe your stewards of MI6
during the recent crisis</i>

743
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:36,821
<i>has been up to scratch?</i>

744
01:27:36,856 --> 01:27:40,249
<i>Well, I believe we have
apprehended the responsible party</i>

745
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:41,775
<i>undertaking all
the necessary steps</i>

746
01:27:41,776 --> 01:27:44,805
<i>to ensure that the sensitive
information is contained.</i>

747
01:27:44,855 --> 01:27:47,764
<i>Ugh! Such a job well done.</i>

748
01:27:48,082 --> 01:27:49,794
<i>I'm not saying
it all gone perfectly, but...</i>

749
01:27:49,911 --> 01:27:52,361
<i>You forgive me for not
putting up the banking.</i>

750
01:27:52,831 --> 01:27:56,181
<i>I find rather difficult to overlook
the monumental security breaches</i>

751
01:27:56,182 --> 01:27:59,797
<i>and dead operatives which you were
singled handily responsible.</i>

752
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:05,326
<i>He's using a polymorphic engine
to mutate the code.</i>

753
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,910
<i>Whenever I try to gain an access,
it changes.</i>

754
01:28:08,124 --> 01:28:11,313
<i>It's like solving the Rubik's cube
that's fighting back.</i>

755
01:28:16,538 --> 01:28:17,985
<i>Stop.</i>

756
01:28:19,573 --> 01:28:21,010
<i>Go into that.</i>

757
01:28:27,817 --> 01:28:29,295
<i>Greensborough.</i>

758
01:28:29,342 --> 01:28:30,795
<i>Greensborough Road,
it's an old...</i>

759
01:28:31,189 --> 01:28:33,352
<i>tube station
on the metropolitan line.</i>

760
01:28:33,361 --> 01:28:35,272
<i>Been closed for years.</i>

761
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:38,906
<i>Use that as a key.</i>

762
01:28:49,744 --> 01:28:51,725
<i>Now, look. It's a map.</i>

763
01:28:54,152 --> 01:28:56,160
<i>It's London.</i>

764
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:58,659
<i>Subterranean London.</i>

765
01:29:00,209 --> 01:29:01,671
<i>What's going on?</i>

766
01:29:01,721 --> 01:29:03,133
<i>Why the doors open?</i>

767
01:29:13,733 --> 01:29:16,432
<i>Can someone tell me how the hell
he got into our system?</i>

768
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:21,810
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

769
01:29:22,428 --> 01:29:25,014
<i>Shit, shit, shit.</i>

770
01:29:26,397 --> 01:29:28,977
<i>He hacted this.</i>

771
01:29:35,491 --> 01:29:37,100
<i>Oh, no.</i>

772
01:29:44,857 --> 01:29:46,139
<i>Q...</i>

773
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,484
<i>He is gone.</i>

774
01:29:57,695 --> 01:29:59,842
<i>I'm on the stairway
of the low isolation.</i>

775
01:30:00,068 --> 01:30:01,285
<i>Are you with me, Q?</i>

776
01:30:01,426 --> 01:30:03,396
<i>I can hear you.
I'm looking for you.</i>

777
01:30:14,057 --> 01:30:15,722
<i>I've got him.
Tracking the location.</i>

778
01:30:15,928 --> 01:30:17,108
<i>Just keep looking forward.</i>

779
01:30:17,956 --> 01:30:19,978
<i>Enter the next service door
on your right.</i>

780
01:30:26,575 --> 01:30:28,486
<i>If you enter through that door,
you should be in the tube.</i>

781
01:30:29,416 --> 01:30:30,701
<i>I'm in the tube.</i>

782
01:30:32,299 --> 01:30:35,372
<i>Bond, this isn't an escape.
This was years in the planning.</i>

783
01:30:35,617 --> 01:30:38,296
<i>He wanted us to capture him,
he wanted us to access his computers.</i>

784
01:30:38,527 --> 01:30:39,446
<i>It was all planned.</i>

785
01:30:40,075 --> 01:30:43,294
<i>Blowing up HQ,
only emergency protocols.</i>

786
01:30:43,839 --> 01:30:46,044
<i>And all we have retrieved
down here.</i>

787
01:30:46,094 --> 01:30:46,977
<i>I got all that.</i>

788
01:30:47,707 --> 01:30:50,150
<i>What it's got planned next
it worries me.</i>

789
01:30:50,314 --> 01:30:51,579
<i>The district line is the closest,</i>

790
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:53,952
<i>there should be
a service door on your left.</i>

791
01:30:55,032 --> 01:30:56,834
<i>Got it.</i>

792
01:31:00,502 --> 01:31:01,448
<i>It won't open.</i>

793
01:31:01,548 --> 01:31:02,998
<i>Of course it will.
Put your back into it.</i>

794
01:31:03,008 --> 01:31:05,391
<i>Why don't you come down here
and put your back into it?</i>

795
01:31:08,792 --> 01:31:10,597
<i>No, it's studded.</i>

796
01:31:11,366 --> 01:31:12,549
<i>Not good.</i>

797
01:31:13,052 --> 01:31:14,859
<i>There's a train coming.</i>

798
01:31:19,059 --> 01:31:21,266
<i>Hmm. That's vexing.</i>

799
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:35,562
<i>I'm through.</i>

800
01:31:35,794 --> 01:31:36,825
<i>I told you.</i>

801
01:31:37,386 --> 01:31:40,142
<i>We've alerted security.
Police are on the way.</i>

802
01:32:17,158 --> 01:32:17,936
<i>Where are you now?</i>

803
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:19,771
<i>Temple tube station.</i>

804
01:32:20,022 --> 01:32:22,449
<i>Along with half of London.</i>

805
01:32:26,231 --> 01:32:27,289
<i>Oh I see. Here you are.</i>

806
01:32:28,266 --> 01:32:30,178
<i>I know where I am, Q.</i>

807
01:32:31,114 --> 01:32:32,036
<i>Where is he?</i>

808
01:32:32,232 --> 01:32:34,666
<i>Give us a second.
I'm looking for him.</i>

809
01:32:42,673 --> 01:32:44,887
<i>There's too many people.
I can't see him.</i>

810
01:32:44,937 --> 01:32:46,436
<i>Welcome to rush hour
on the tube.</i>

811
01:32:47,281 --> 01:32:49,667
<i>Something you don't know
much about.</i>

812
01:32:59,781 --> 01:33:01,157
<i>The train's leaving.</i>

813
01:33:01,539 --> 01:33:03,009
<i>Do I get on the train?</i>

814
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:06,216
<i>Don't get on the train unless
he's on it. Give us a minute.</i>

815
01:33:08,456 --> 01:33:10,169
<i>Tell me if I get on the train.</i>

816
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,482
<i>- Bond...
- What?</i>

817
01:33:17,816 --> 01:33:19,362
<i>Get on the train.</i>

818
01:33:32,865 --> 01:33:34,686
<i>He's keen to get home.</i>

819
01:33:35,295 --> 01:33:36,864
<i>Open the door, please.</i>

820
01:33:39,252 --> 01:33:41,259
<i>Open the door.</i>

821
01:33:44,241 --> 01:33:46,880
<i>I'm from Safety.
Carry on.</i>

822
01:33:53,266 --> 01:33:56,314
<i>- Where are you?
- Take a wild guess, Q.</i>

823
01:33:56,928 --> 01:33:59,657
<i>He's in disguise, now.
Disguised as a policeman.</i>

824
01:34:22,141 --> 01:34:23,433
<i>Where is he going?</i>

825
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,240
<i>Where is he going?</i>

826
01:34:32,209 --> 01:34:33,079
<i>He's going for M.</i>

827
01:34:33,201 --> 01:34:35,125
<i>Tell Tanner.
Get her out of there.</i>

828
01:34:35,150 --> 01:34:37,500
<i>You overlooked
or chosen to ignore</i>

829
01:34:37,693 --> 01:34:38,855
<i>hard evidence...</i>

830
01:34:39,472 --> 01:34:42,596
<i>and consistently,
almost obstinately...</i>

831
01:34:42,878 --> 01:34:44,221
<i>Silva has escaped.</i>

832
01:34:44,732 --> 01:34:45,466
<i>Bond's in pursuit.</i>

833
01:34:45,717 --> 01:34:48,414
<i>We need to get you to a secured
location immediately, ma'am.</i>

834
01:34:48,496 --> 01:34:50,753
<i>Like hell am I going
to show him my back.</i>

835
01:34:51,046 --> 01:34:53,116
<i>Are we straining your attention?</i>

836
01:34:53,273 --> 01:34:56,891
<i>No. Please, Minister.
Proceed.</i>

837
01:35:04,793 --> 01:35:06,255
<i>Excuse me.</i>

838
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:30,768
<i>It's as if you insist on pretending</i>

839
01:36:30,819 --> 01:36:33,263
<i>we still live in the
golden age of espionage,</i>

840
01:36:33,313 --> 01:36:36,519
<i>when human intelligence
was the only resource available.</i>

841
01:36:36,637 --> 01:36:38,982
<i>Well, I find this rather
old-fashioned belief</i>

842
01:36:39,246 --> 01:36:41,900
<i>demonstrates
a reckless disregard for every...</i>

843
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:44,283
<i>Excuse me, Minister.
I don't mean to interrupt but...</i>

844
01:36:44,371 --> 01:36:45,962
<i>Just for the sake of variety,</i>

845
01:36:46,743 --> 01:36:49,320
<i>might we actually hear
from the witness?</i>

846
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:51,874
<i>Of course.</i>

847
01:36:55,152 --> 01:36:56,906
<i>Thank you.</i>

848
01:37:25,123 --> 01:37:27,315
<i>I won't miss next time,
Mr. Silva.</i>

849
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:28,254
<i>Not bad.</i>

850
01:37:28,363 --> 01:37:31,088
<i>Not bad, James,
for a physical wreck.</i>

851
01:37:31,382 --> 01:37:32,943
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

852
01:37:33,402 --> 01:37:34,824
<i>You caught me.</i>

853
01:37:36,584 --> 01:37:39,723
<i>Now, here's your prize.</i>

854
01:37:39,773 --> 01:37:43,119
<i>The latest thing
from my local toy store.</i>

855
01:37:43,502 --> 01:37:46,433
<i>It is called "radio".</i>

856
01:37:54,477 --> 01:37:56,305
<i>I do hope that wasn't for me.</i>

857
01:37:56,663 --> 01:37:57,707
<i>No.</i>

858
01:37:58,501 --> 01:37:59,630
<i>But that is.</i>

859
01:38:51,323 --> 01:38:52,342
<i>Chairman, Ministers...</i>

860
01:38:52,517 --> 01:38:54,815
<i>Today I've repeatedly heard how</i>

861
01:38:55,133 --> 01:38:57,547
<i>irrelevant my department
has become.</i>

862
01:38:57,722 --> 01:39:00,219
<i>Why you we need agents
for Double-O section.</i>

863
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:02,416
<i>Isn't that all rather quaint?</i>

864
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:06,443
<i>Well, I suppose I see a different
world than you do.</i>

865
01:39:07,571 --> 01:39:11,049
<i>And the truth is that
what I see frightens me.</i>

866
01:39:12,745 --> 01:39:16,482
<i>I'm frightened because our enemies
are not longer known to us.</i>

867
01:39:17,256 --> 01:39:19,268
<i>They do not exist on the map.</i>

868
01:39:19,367 --> 01:39:21,218
<i>They're not nations.</i>

869
01:39:21,647 --> 01:39:23,086
<i>They are individuals.</i>

870
01:39:24,681 --> 01:39:26,571
<i>But look around you,
who do you fear?</i>

871
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:30,836
<i>Can you see a face,
a uniform, a flag? No.</i>

872
01:39:31,675 --> 01:39:33,792
<i>Our world is not
more transparent now.</i>

873
01:39:34,017 --> 01:39:35,477
<i>It's more opaque.</i>

874
01:39:35,911 --> 01:39:37,687
<i>It's in the shadows.</i>

875
01:39:38,758 --> 01:39:41,092
<i>That's where we must
do battle.</i>

876
01:39:42,098 --> 01:39:45,236
<i>So, before you declare
us irrelevant, ask yourselves:</i>

877
01:39:46,385 --> 01:39:49,055
<i>How safe do you feel?</i>

878
01:39:53,470 --> 01:39:55,117
<i>Just one more thing to say.</i>

879
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:58,364
<i>My late husband was
a great lover of poetry.</i>

880
01:39:58,781 --> 01:40:00,394
<i>And, um...</i>

881
01:40:00,444 --> 01:40:02,358
<i>I suppose some of it sunk in,</i>

882
01:40:02,383 --> 01:40:04,529
<i>despite my best intentions.</i>

883
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:06,478
<i>And here today,
I remember this.</i>

884
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:09,399
<i>I think, from Tennyson.</i>

885
01:40:12,007 --> 01:40:14,778
<i>We are not now that strength</i>

886
01:40:15,467 --> 01:40:18,180
<i>which in old days
moved earth and heaven.</i>

887
01:40:19,514 --> 01:40:21,460
<i>That which we are, we are.</i>

888
01:40:22,492 --> 01:40:25,499
<i>One equal temper
of heroic hearts.</i>

889
01:40:26,436 --> 01:40:30,590
<i>Made weak by time and fate,</i>

890
01:40:31,222 --> 01:40:34,316
<i>but strong in will...</i>

891
01:40:34,365 --> 01:40:37,702
<i>to strive, to seek, to find</i>

892
01:40:38,118 --> 01:40:41,385
<i>and not to yield.</i>

893
01:42:04,028 --> 01:42:05,294
<i>Move.</i>

894
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:07,915
<i>Move. Move.</i>

895
01:42:47,723 --> 01:42:49,469
<i>007, what the hell
are we doing?</i>

896
01:42:49,585 --> 01:42:50,887
<i>You're kidnapping me.</i>

897
01:42:50,912 --> 01:42:53,176
<i>That would be one way
of looking at it.</i>

898
01:42:55,438 --> 01:42:57,840
<i>Too many people are dying
because of me.</i>

899
01:42:58,201 --> 01:43:00,139
<i>If you wants you,
he's going to have to come and get you.</i>

900
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:02,580
<i>We've been one step behind Silva
from the start.</i>

901
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:04,991
<i>It's time to get out in front
and change the game.</i>

902
01:43:05,854 --> 01:43:07,570
<i>And I'm to be the bait?</i>

903
01:43:09,787 --> 01:43:11,245
<i>All right.</i>

904
01:43:11,822 --> 01:43:14,133
<i>Just us.
No one else.</i>

905
01:43:15,091 --> 01:43:17,382
<i>Q, I need help.</i>

906
01:43:17,519 --> 01:43:19,314
<i>I'm tracking the car.
Where are you going?</i>

907
01:43:19,594 --> 01:43:21,834
<i>I got M.
We're about to disappear.</i>

908
01:43:22,225 --> 01:43:23,163
<i>What?</i>

909
01:43:23,364 --> 01:43:24,521
<i>I need you to lay
a trail of breadcrumbs</i>

910
01:43:24,522 --> 01:43:26,823
<i>impossible to follow
for anyone except Silva.</i>

911
01:43:26,848 --> 01:43:28,347
<i>You think you can do it?</i>

912
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:31,631
<i>I'm guessing
this isn't strictly official.</i>

913
01:43:31,807 --> 01:43:33,151
<i>Not even remotely.</i>

914
01:43:33,322 --> 01:43:36,485
<i>So much for my promising
career in espionage.</i>

915
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:47,429
<i>Well, I'm not hiding in there
if that's your brilliant plan.</i>

916
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:49,487
<i>We're changing vehicles.</i>

917
01:43:50,076 --> 01:43:53,366
<i>The trouble with company cars
is they have trackers.</i>

918
01:44:02,868 --> 01:44:05,806
<i>And I suppose that's completely
inconspicuous.</i>

919
01:44:06,744 --> 01:44:08,187
<i>Get in.</i>

920
01:44:30,507 --> 01:44:32,347
<i>It's not been accountable, is it?</i>

921
01:44:34,296 --> 01:44:36,134
<i>Are you going to complain
the whole way?</i>

922
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:38,043
<i>Oh, go on and eject me.</i>

923
01:44:38,093 --> 01:44:39,383
<i>See if I care.</i>

924
01:44:41,942 --> 01:44:43,188
<i>Where are we going?</i>

925
01:44:44,943 --> 01:44:45,860
<i>Back in time.</i>

926
01:44:47,068 --> 01:44:49,072
<i>Somewhere we'll have
the advantage.</i>

927
01:44:51,129 --> 01:44:52,258
<i>It's a fine line.</i>

928
01:44:52,861 --> 01:44:55,340
<i>If a breadcrumb’s too small
then he might miss it.</i>

929
01:44:55,481 --> 01:44:57,854
<i>Too big and Silva
will smell the rat.</i>

930
01:44:57,904 --> 01:45:00,774
<i>That's what you think, even Silva
will be able to spot that?</i>

931
01:45:01,147 --> 01:45:02,525
<i>He's the only one who could.</i>

932
01:45:05,438 --> 01:45:06,517
<i>Sir...</i>

933
01:45:09,514 --> 01:45:10,745
<i>What are you doing?</i>

934
01:45:10,770 --> 01:45:12,177
<i>We just monitoring...</i>

935
01:45:12,427 --> 01:45:15,826
<i>Creating a false tracking signal
for Silva to follow.</i>

936
01:45:16,122 --> 01:45:17,262
<i>Well, sir...</i>

937
01:45:18,195 --> 01:45:20,086
<i>Excellent thinking.
Get them isolated.</i>

938
01:45:20,179 --> 01:45:21,985
<i>Send him on the I89.
It's the direct route.</i>

939
01:45:22,075 --> 01:45:24,194
<i>You can monitor his progress
more accurately</i>

940
01:45:24,579 --> 01:45:26,697
<i>and confirm it
with the traffic cameras.</i>

941
01:45:26,747 --> 01:45:28,824
<i>But what if PM finds out?</i>

942
01:45:29,931 --> 01:45:31,583
<i>Then, they're all bugged.</i>

943
01:45:32,148 --> 01:45:33,813
<i>Carry on.</i>

944
01:46:15,929 --> 01:46:17,405
<i>This is where you grew up?</i>

945
01:46:18,627 --> 01:46:19,841
<i>Mmhh...</i>

946
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:24,298
<i>How old were you
when you died?</i>

947
01:46:27,744 --> 01:46:29,668
<i>You know the answer to that.</i>

948
01:46:31,839 --> 01:46:33,763
<i>You know the whole story.</i>

949
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:44,786
<i>Orphans always make
the best recruits.</i>

950
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:52,548
<i>The storm's coming.</i>

951
01:47:52,534 --> 01:47:54,372
<i>Christ...</i>

952
01:47:56,635 --> 01:47:58,379
<i>I wonder
you never came back.</i>

953
01:48:49,334 --> 01:48:50,750
<i>James...</i>

954
01:48:50,922 --> 01:48:52,594
<i>James Bond.</i>

955
01:48:52,644 --> 01:48:54,269
<i>Good God.</i>

956
01:48:55,721 --> 01:48:57,373
<i>You're still alive.</i>

957
01:48:58,954 --> 01:49:01,329
<i>Nice to see you too.</i>

958
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:04,541
<i>M... this is Kincade.</i>

959
01:49:05,203 --> 01:49:07,499
<i>Kincade is keeping here
since I was a boy.</i>

960
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:10,338
<i>- Please to meet you, Emma.
- Mr. Kincade.</i>

961
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:15,173
<i>You're a tad late. They sold the place
when they thought you were dead.</i>

962
01:49:15,238 --> 01:49:17,027
<i>Seems they were wrong.</i>

963
01:49:17,926 --> 01:49:19,189
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

964
01:49:19,661 --> 01:49:21,489
<i>Some men are coming to kill us.</i>

965
01:49:22,868 --> 01:49:24,430
<i>We're going to kill them first.</i>

966
01:49:26,251 --> 01:49:28,599
<i>Then we'd better get ready.</i>

967
01:49:30,143 --> 01:49:31,647
<i>Do we still have
a gun room?</i>

968
01:49:35,401 --> 01:49:39,897
<i>They sold a lot to a collector
from Idaho or some such place.</i>

969
01:49:40,009 --> 01:49:42,537
<i>They were shipped up
weeks ago.</i>

970
01:49:43,154 --> 01:49:48,467
<i>There's just your father's
old hunting rifle.</i>

971
01:49:49,336 --> 01:49:51,520
<i>We couldn't let that go.</i>

972
01:49:57,417 --> 01:49:58,818
<i>And this is what we've got.</i>

973
01:50:00,363 --> 01:50:03,418
<i>There might be a couple of sticks
of dynamite from the quarry.</i>

974
01:50:04,454 --> 01:50:07,956
<i>But if all else fails,
sometimes...</i>

975
01:50:08,448 --> 01:50:11,717
<i>the old ways
are the best.</i>

976
01:50:16,773 --> 01:50:19,303
<i>So, who are we
supposedly fighting?</i>

977
01:50:19,734 --> 01:50:21,680
<i>No "we", Kincade.</i>

978
01:50:22,288 --> 01:50:24,133
<i>This is not your fight.</i>

979
01:50:24,158 --> 01:50:27,337
<i>Try to stop me,
you jumped-up little shit.</i>

980
01:50:29,008 --> 01:50:32,604
<i>Now, remember what I taught to you.
Don't let it pull to the left.</i>

981
01:50:33,924 --> 01:50:35,652
<i>I'll do my best.</i>

982
01:50:44,459 --> 01:50:46,752
<i>What did you say
you did for a living?</i>

983
01:51:02,113 --> 01:51:03,428
<i>Emma...</i>

984
01:51:04,299 --> 01:51:06,339
<i>I brought you some things.</i>

985
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:11,105
<i>The nights get cold here.</i>

986
01:51:11,967 --> 01:51:13,646
<i>Thank you, Mr. Kincade.</i>

987
01:51:15,290 --> 01:51:16,636
<i>It's a beautiful old house.</i>

988
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:18,139
<i>She is.</i>

989
01:51:18,431 --> 01:51:20,333
<i>And like all great ladies,</i>

990
01:51:20,915 --> 01:51:23,237
<i>she still has
her secrets ways.</i>

991
01:51:23,912 --> 01:51:25,374
<i>Let me show you this.</i>

992
01:51:30,469 --> 01:51:31,644
<i>A priest hole.</i>

993
01:51:31,695 --> 01:51:34,070
<i>Yes, from
Reformation times.</i>

994
01:51:34,587 --> 01:51:36,234
<i>The tunnel leads
under the moor.</i>

995
01:51:36,284 --> 01:51:38,986
<i>If you get in danger,
this is the place to come.</i>

996
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:41,957
<i>The night I told him
his parents have died...</i>

997
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:45,420
<i>he's hidden here
for two days.</i>

998
01:51:47,315 --> 01:51:48,860
<i>But he did come out.</i>

999
01:51:49,403 --> 01:51:51,337
<i>He was no boy anymore.</i>

1000
01:51:52,452 --> 01:51:54,517
<i>We must get on.</i>

1001
01:53:54,864 --> 01:53:57,140
<i>I fucked this up,
didn't I?</i>

1002
01:53:58,480 --> 01:53:59,813
<i>No.</i>

1003
01:54:01,608 --> 01:54:03,422
<i>You did your job.</i>

1004
01:54:08,586 --> 01:54:10,328
<i>I read your obituary of me.</i>

1005
01:54:11,988 --> 01:54:14,283
<i>- And?
- Appalling.</i>

1006
01:54:15,133 --> 01:54:16,843
<i>Yeah, I knew you'd hate it.</i>

1007
01:54:19,159 --> 01:54:21,258
<i>It called you 'An example
of the British fortitude.'</i>

1008
01:54:22,208 --> 01:54:23,582
<i>I think that was all right.</i>

1009
01:54:29,088 --> 01:54:30,405
<i>Are you ready?</i>

1010
01:54:30,414 --> 01:54:33,040
<i>I was ready before
you're were born, son.</i>

1011
01:55:53,323 --> 01:55:55,181
<i>Welcome to Scotland.</i>

1012
01:57:11,878 --> 01:57:13,716
<i>You dropped something?</i>

1013
01:57:39,955 --> 01:57:41,101
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

1014
01:57:41,143 --> 01:57:42,689
<i>Only my pride.</i>

1015
01:57:42,873 --> 01:57:44,697
<i>I never was a good shot.</i>

1016
01:57:49,619 --> 01:57:50,647
<i>He's not here,</i>

1017
01:57:51,627 --> 01:57:52,851
<i>and he's not here.</i>

1018
01:58:27,437 --> 01:58:29,608
<i>Always good
at making an entrance.</i>

1019
01:58:30,654 --> 01:58:32,526
<i>You two, go to
the kitchen. Now!</i>

1020
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:58,800
<i>Go behind the yard.</i>

1021
01:59:41,468 --> 01:59:43,582
<i>Go to the chapel.
Use the tunnel.</i>

1022
02:01:04,587 --> 02:01:07,750
<i>Everyone listen to me.
Don't you dare touch M.</i>

1023
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:09,343
<i>She's mine.</i>

1024
02:01:26,054 --> 02:01:28,447
<i>And your friends
come out and say 'hello'?</i>

1025
02:02:35,207 --> 02:02:38,106
<i>Come on. This way.</i>

1026
02:03:35,313 --> 02:03:37,606
<i>I always hated this place.</i>

1027
02:03:47,647 --> 02:03:49,813
<i>Are you getting warm?</i>

1028
02:05:17,702 --> 02:05:19,723
<i>Just make sure
Bond is dead.</i>

1029
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:25,590
<i>Now it's me and her.</i>

1030
02:07:23,544 --> 02:07:27,360
<i>You see what comes of all
this running around, Mr. Bond?</i>

1031
02:07:28,263 --> 02:07:30,943
<i>All this jumping
and fighting.</i>

1032
02:07:30,969 --> 02:07:32,459
<i>It's exhausting.</i>

1033
02:07:35,876 --> 02:07:37,081
<i>Relax.</i>

1034
02:07:39,037 --> 02:07:40,743
<i>You need to relax.</i>

1035
02:08:00,234 --> 02:08:02,197
<i>Well, mother's calling.</i>

1036
02:08:04,016 --> 02:08:06,436
<i>I'll give her
a goodbye kiss for you.</i>

1037
02:10:25,429 --> 02:10:27,083
<i>Of course.</i>

1038
02:10:27,408 --> 02:10:29,128
<i>It had to be here.</i>

1039
02:10:31,695 --> 02:10:33,849
<i>It had to be this way.</i>

1040
02:10:34,896 --> 02:10:36,529
<i>Thank you.</i>

1041
02:10:36,687 --> 02:10:37,880
<i>- I can't find it, though.
- No.</i>

1042
02:10:42,227 --> 02:10:43,275
<i>Please.</i>

1043
02:10:44,019 --> 02:10:45,425
<i>Don't.</i>

1044
02:11:00,182 --> 02:11:01,775
<i>You're hurt. You're hurt.</i>

1045
02:11:06,733 --> 02:11:09,014
<i>What have they
done to you?</i>

1046
02:11:09,498 --> 02:11:11,619
<i>What have they
done to you?</i>

1047
02:11:43,836 --> 02:11:45,221
<i>Free the both of us.</i>

1048
02:11:45,903 --> 02:11:47,196
<i>Free the both of us.</i>

1049
02:11:49,025 --> 02:11:50,795
<i>With the same bullet.</i>

1050
02:11:52,067 --> 02:11:53,107
<i>Do it.</i>

1051
02:11:54,085 --> 02:11:55,370
<i>Do it!</i>

1052
02:11:56,862 --> 02:11:58,451
<i>Only you can do it.</i>

1053
02:11:59,281 --> 02:12:00,372
<i>Do it!</i>

1054
02:12:42,911 --> 02:12:44,445
<i>Last rat standing.</i>

1055
02:12:55,056 --> 02:12:56,707
<i>007.</i>

1056
02:12:56,769 --> 02:12:57,896
<i>What took you so long?</i>

1057
02:12:58,545 --> 02:12:59,545
<i>Oh, I...</i>

1058
02:12:59,546 --> 02:13:01,762
<i>got into some
deep water.</i>

1059
02:13:17,356 --> 02:13:18,822
<i>I suppose it's...</i>

1060
02:13:19,782 --> 02:13:22,471
<i>too late to hang around
and fret.</i>

1061
02:13:28,394 --> 02:13:30,440
<i>Well, I'm game if you are.</i>

1062
02:13:40,633 --> 02:13:43,301
<i>I did get one thing right.</i>

1063
02:15:07,388 --> 02:15:08,336
<i>Wow!</i>

1064
02:15:09,891 --> 02:15:12,241
<i>I didn't even know
you could come up here.</i>

1065
02:15:13,431 --> 02:15:15,445
<i>I hate to waste a view.</i>

1066
02:15:15,495 --> 02:15:17,511
<i>I can see why.</i>

1067
02:15:19,307 --> 02:15:22,047
<i>I thought you were going back
out on active service.</i>

1068
02:15:23,463 --> 02:15:25,099
<i>I declined.</i>

1069
02:15:26,867 --> 02:15:28,320
<i>You said it yourself.</i>

1070
02:15:28,923 --> 02:15:30,913
<i>Field works
are not for everyone.</i>

1071
02:15:31,814 --> 02:15:34,554
<i>If it helps,
I feel a lot safer.</i>

1072
02:15:39,943 --> 02:15:41,666
<i>Her will was read today.</i>

1073
02:15:42,717 --> 02:15:44,456
<i>She left you this.</i>

1074
02:15:56,477 --> 02:15:59,139
<i>Maybe it was her way of telling you
to take a desk job.</i>

1075
02:16:00,257 --> 02:16:01,852
<i>Just the opposite.</i>

1076
02:16:05,125 --> 02:16:06,847
<i>Thank you.</i>

1077
02:16:25,397 --> 02:16:27,848
<i>You know, we've never formally
been introduced.</i>

1078
02:16:31,663 --> 02:16:33,372
<i>My name is Eve.</i>

1079
02:16:34,008 --> 02:16:35,573
<i>Eve Money penny.</i>

1080
02:16:36,140 --> 02:16:38,798
<i>I look forward to our time together,
Miss Money penny.</i>

1081
02:16:39,394 --> 02:16:40,637
<i>Me too.</i>

1082
02:16:41,224 --> 02:16:43,854
<i>I'm sure we will have
one or two clear shaves.</i>

1083
02:16:45,748 --> 02:16:46,910
<i>Good morning, 007.</i>

1084
02:16:47,190 --> 02:16:49,852
<i>- Good morning, Tanner.
- He will see you now.</i>

1085
02:17:05,058 --> 02:17:06,284
<i>How's the arm, sir?</i>

1086
02:17:06,780 --> 02:17:07,558
<i>What?</i>

1087
02:17:07,881 --> 02:17:09,260
<i>Oh, it's fine.</i>

1088
02:17:09,441 --> 02:17:10,721
<i>It will get better.</i>

1089
02:17:10,857 --> 02:17:12,301
<i>All pretty shocking
for someone</i>

1090
02:17:12,302 --> 02:17:14,906
<i>unused to field work.</i>

1091
02:17:16,735 --> 02:17:18,575
<i>So, 007...</i>

1092
02:17:18,996 --> 02:17:21,122
<i>Lots to be done.</i>

1093
02:17:24,456 --> 02:17:26,641
<i>Are you ready
to get back to work?</i>

1094
02:17:28,295 --> 02:17:29,895
<i>With pleasure, M.</i>

1095
02:17:32,432 --> 02:17:34,030
<i>With pleasure.</i>
