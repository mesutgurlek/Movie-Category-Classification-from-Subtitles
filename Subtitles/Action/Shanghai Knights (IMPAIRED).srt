00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,843
Sherlock Holmes.

644
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,476
Which province do you represent,
Your Highness?

645
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:54,084
Nevada.

646
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:17,803
May l present
Major General Sherlock Holmes

647
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,874
and His Highness,
the maharaja of Nevada.

648
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,934
How are the security
arrangements?

649
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:41,164
Oh , everything seems to be
going swimmingly, my Lord .

650
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,432
And if l may say so. . .

651
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:45,134
it is an honor to guard
Your Lordship tonight.

652
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,643
l speak for all of us
at Scotland Yard

653
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,680
when l say that no matter how
far you are from the throne. . .

654
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,376
you'll always be number one
in our hearts.

655
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,053
Okay, here's the plan .

656
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,615
We're gonna get
a little chow.

657
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,422
Then we're gonna
sneak out of here.

658
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,929
-Start looking for that seal .
-Okay.

659
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,124
-Spotted Dick, sir?
-What?

660
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,928
Spotted Dick.

661
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,531
Can you believe this guy?

662
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,697
l'm trying to get
something to eat.

663
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,638
He's asking me
if l got the clap.

664
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,643
l think
he's offering you food .

665
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:23,703
Oh . Spotted Dick.

666
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,248
Oh , no.
l think l'll pass.

667
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,748
l'm not really
a dessert man .

668
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:30,116
Perhaps my friend might like
some Spotted Dick.

669
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,087
[ Laughs ]

670
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:34,090
l might try
one of these sausages.

671
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,921
A little smoky Joe.

672
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,855
Mmm ! This is good !

673
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,024
l thought the food here
was supposed to suck.

674
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,295
The haggis is fresh
from Scotland , sir.

675
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:48,099
lt's made from
the finest sheeps' bladders.

676
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,306
l'm gonna get some whiskey
and wash my mouth out.

677
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,312
You should try the quail .

678
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,848
l shot them myself
this morning .

679
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,923
How do you do, Your Lordship?

680
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,723
Very well , thank you .

681
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:16,129
l'm not acquainted
with the Nevada province.

682
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,863
But l haven't been to lndia
since '81 .

683
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,373
l spent most of my time
in the Orient.

684
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:27,035
l hear you've just returned
from China.

685
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:30,238
You are well-informed ,
maharaja.

686
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,544
lt is my dream
that the Chinese people

687
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:35,949
will follow lndia's example and
one day embrace British rule.

688
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,577
The Chinese are very proud .

689
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:41,112
They place family and honor
above all else.

690
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,627
Well , l'm sure
we can break them of that.

691
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:51,233
lf you'll excuse me,
l have a matter to attend to.

692
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,633
Until we meet again .

693
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:01,810
Patience.
l'm proud of you , Chon .

694
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,370
We must find the seal .

695
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,112
What do you see?

696
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:10,153
Shh , shh , shh !

697
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:17,084
He just pulled a fancy
dragon key out of his desk.

698
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,627
That was my father's!

699
00:48:18,695 --> 00:48:20,185
l must avenge his honor.

700
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,664
Hey, slow down , tiger.
Slow down .

701
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,201
Quit going all Chinese on me.

702
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:30,198
Where is he?

703
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,970
Damn it. Remember
your puzzle box. Patience.

704
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,407
Okay, there are no windows.

705
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,505
We just came in
through the only doorway.

706
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,243
That leaves one explanation .

707
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,080
Remember in "Roy O'Bannon
vs. The Mummy"

708
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,312
how the zombie king got away

709
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,218
when l chased him
into the pharaoh's tomb?

710
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:48,019
There's a secret passageway
behind the sphinx.

711
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,458
There's gotta be a lever
or a button over here.

712
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,553
Help me lift some stuff up.

713
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:08,466
Roy!

714
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:10,911
The painting .
lt's looking at me.

715
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,243
-Look!
-Oh , yeah .

716
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:14,409
Looks like it's looking at me.
That's great.

717
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,645
No, real eyes.
Moving !

718
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,086
That kid got to you ,
didn't he?

719
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,420
Unbelievable!
We're not in a haunted house.

720
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,550
That's a technique
that an artist uses.

721
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,619
"Ubiquitous gaze" or "pursuant
eyes" is the technical term .

722
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,689
lt's unnerving , though .
l'll give you that.

723
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:37,740
Roy.
Now, those eyes. Look!

724
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,241
Whatever you say, Chon .

725
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,179
Let's see what you got here,
Rathbone.

726
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,750
Roy!

727
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,118
What, Chon?
Are the statues moving now?

728
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:07,693
Wow.

729
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,232
Mm-mmm !

730
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:37,863
Roy!

731
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:42,800
l can't hear myself think
with you shouting at me.

732
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,099
Chon?

733
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,340
Chon? Chon?

734
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:52,910
This is ridiculous.

735
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,611
lf you want to act
like a child and play games. . .

736
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:57,152
then find someone else. . .

737
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,619
'cause l take
this stuff seriously.

738
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,486
l'm here to work.
l'm on a mission .

739
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,485
Chon?

740
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:07,357
Okay, Chon .

741
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,491
Okay, you little
Chinese otter.

742
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,898
Let's play.

743
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,195
Ha!

744
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:28,743
Chon , demons!

745
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:50,504
She's gonna fight
my battles for me.

746
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,304
Come on .
Let's go.

747
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,969
What? What are you doing?

748
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,607
lt's kinky.
l like it.

749
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,150
Wow! Look at this.

750
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,053
Wait. There's something
different about this room .

751
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,401
Hey.
