1
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeow!

2
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,900
Next time amigo.

3
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,700
Finished.

4
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,900
- Where's my girl?
- Fool.

5
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
Oh she's cool man. She in there.

6
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,400
She's still fine as hell. So that's it?

7
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,200
Badda Bing. You out of the game.

8
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,100
- Done with the whole trade?
- Yeah.

9
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,300
Well that's the whole problem
Bosco. You either keep doing that

10
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,400
or you can do a fifteen year
bid in the Mexican prison

11
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,400
with Chito's cousin
and them. Same old shit.

12
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,000
You choose how to flush the
toilet brother. That's right.

13
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,200
Easy way or the hard way

14
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,300
Watch yourself B.A now. You gonna
lose your order of spin here.

15
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,800
What's up girl? You miss me?

16
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
'Cause I missed you. I did.

17
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,200
It's been too long baby. Way too long.

18
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,000
Heck of a place. Just a
heck of a beautiful place.

19
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,300
Is this a time share? I'd
love to get in on this.

20
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,700
I like this whole Santa Fe
motif you've got going here Rico.

21
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,200
Very Arizona, very Tex Mex. It's good.

22
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,900
Maybe we can get the guy in my six to
whip up a couple quesadillas you know.

23
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,000
Americano, Gringo Army intelligence.

24
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,400
- Who's that?
- You man.

25
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,400
- Not so intelligent because you're
stuck in some tires man.
- I'm happy. I'm happy.

26
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,100
It doesn't get any better than this right?

27
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,300
I'm living the dream.

28
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,900
You're think you're going to come here...

29
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,700
Well fist of all, she's so hot and uh...

30
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,600
we both hate you so
that's just sort of how...

31
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,100
Good Morning!

32
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,200
Now it's a party! Is that your best shot?

33
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,800
Now it's a party!

34
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,900
Whoa!

35
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,000
- Oh, hell no.
- Slide over... slowly.

36
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,100
You jackin' me? What is this?

37
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,100
Opposite day?

38
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,600
I'm not a thief but if I
don't reach my friend in time,

39
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,100
then he dies.

40
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,600
If you ain't a thief I
guarantee you ain't a killer.

41
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,000
Take your left hand off the wheel,
and your right hand off the shifter.

42
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,100
- Now.
- You ain't gonna shoot me in the head Pops.

43
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,600
You know that ain't happenin'.

44
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,800
What the hell's wrong with you
man? You shoot a total stranger?

45
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,400
I don't even know you fool. Damn!

46
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,300
Oh it will heal I promise.

47
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,200
Here wrap it in this.

48
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,800
I know how to make a tourniquet fool.

49
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,700
I know it hurts but I had
to make a point with you.

50
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,400
That ain't what's pissin' me off.

51
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,300
You shooting my van that's
what's pissing me off man.

52
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,400
What's wrong with you?

53
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,600
- You Army Ranger son?
- Be real careful what you say next Pops.

54
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,900
You be ready to empty that burner if
you start shit talkin' my battalion.

55
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,900
- Colonel Hanibal Smith. 75th Ranger Regiment.
- 4th Battallion. Fort Bean, Georgia.

56
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,100
I know who you are sir.
Corporal B.A. Baracus.

57
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,600
I mean the words out. Dishonorable
discharge For some bullshit.

58
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,500
I don't subscribe to coincidence Corporal.

59
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,100
I believe that no matter how
random things might appear,

60
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,100
there still a plan.

61
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,400
Out here in the middle of the Mexican
desert, when I need it the most.

62
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,300
I find a fellow Ranger.

63
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,100
Now I need your help to save another.

64
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,800
Your rescue is on the way.

65
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Your rescue is coming? We
fed him to the rotweillers

66
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,300
about an hour ago.

67
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,800
Do you realize that you
actually believe that you got me.

68
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,000
You actually think
you're going to kill me.

69
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,000
- Can you drive?
- Better than anybody you've ever seen sir.

70
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,000
In two minutes I'm going
to be having a cold beer.

71
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,900
And you will be on fire.
Take care my friend.

72
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,600
Alpha, Mike...

73
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,900
Foxtrot.

74
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,600
Think about it.

75
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,800
Adios! Mother Fu...

76
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,600
Hannibal.

77
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,900
What are you doing?

78
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,800
Get in.

79
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,200
B.A. Move!

80
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,700
This is bullshit!

81
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,900
Please stop, please stop, ow! Please stop.

82
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,200
How's your day going?

83
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
This is not gonna taste good.

84
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,400
Oh baby, I just threw
up. Let me get some gum.

85
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,900
Did you see that? Did you see Tuco's face?

86
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,700
When you came over that was unbelievable!

87
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,500
- How many times did I say it?
- I mean your timing was perfect.

88
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,000
- How many times did I say it Face?

89
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,600
I told you to take down Tuco alone.

90
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,100
You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't
have the Hannibal Smith "How To" manual.

91
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,100
- I had to move.
- That move snowballed, Face.

92
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,300
You almost got yourself killed.

93
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,900
You almost got me killed.

94
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,200
You almost got him killed.

95
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,500
Thank you Peck.

96
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,100
Baracus. It's all good.

97
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,500
I was trying to save her.

98
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,600
Save her?

99
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah.

100
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,200
Save her?

101
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,700
Yeah.

102
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,300
How?

103
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,900
Please do share with us your plan Face.

104
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,900
Okay, I hadn't thought about that yet.

105
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,700
Exactly. I had to.

106
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,800
- Pike.
- Boss.

107
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,800
- Still trampling the same dirt?
- I am unfortunately.

108
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,200
- So what have you got for me?
- I've got a fast bird doin' pizza runs.

109
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
- Call sign it Hatchet.
- Hatchet?

110
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,200
This is yours. And your pilot, if you
want to call him that is somewhere inside.

111
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
- Be careful boss.
- I owe you one.

112
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,500
- Okay, let's not wait to brag though.
- Three years.

113
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,000
How am I going to leave my girl like this?
After all that I had to fight to get her back.

114
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,100
Leave the keys and
we'll come back for her.

115
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
Find a treatment room
Corporal. Make it quick.

116
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,100
I'm going to find our pilot.

117
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,500
Oh hey doc. You got a
second for a wounded vet?

118
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,600
Hardly that great of a combat pilot. You ask
him, he thinks he's the best in the world.

119
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,200
But he's a functioning lunatic.

120
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,400
Last week he tried to escape
by jump starting an ambulance.

121
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,800
My kind of guy.

122
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,200
- It almost hit your tattoo there.
- Has anybody seen Mr.. Murdock?

123
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,700
The old Ranger tatt.

124
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,300
Would you think I was crazy if
I told you I had one of these?

125
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,800
- Stuck on two eyes man.
- Mr. Murdock?

126
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,700
Not while I'm operating nurse.

127
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,500
- Not now.
- Why are you off the ward?

128
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,600
Is that gas? Is that you?

129
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
- I smell gas.
- What do you mean ward?

130
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,200
- This man is a patient here.
- Don't listen to her, she's crazy.

131
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,400
- Honestly, I am practicing
doctor at John Hopkins...
- Is he actually working on you?

132
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,800
- You asked him to do a lightning bolt?
- I didn't ask for no lightning bolt.

133
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,700
What's wrong with this fool?

134
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,200
- You're on fire man.
- What? What's that?

135
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,000
- You Rangers are awesome.
- Are you crazy?!

136
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,000
Hey! Hey! Come on!

137
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,600
Back off!

138
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,700
Back off! This is a hospital.

139
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,600
- Everybody's met Mr. Murdock.
- Met him? He lit my arm on fire.

140
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,500
- He stitched a lightning bolt in mine man.
- Look at me son.

141
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,900
I'm told you're a hell of a chopper pilot.

142
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,600
- The best sir.
- I'm not getting on a chopper with this nut job.

143
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,000
- That's a good... is he
another one of your projects?
- I'm a real soldier

144
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,500
- I'm a Ranger baby!
- I'm worried!

145
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,500
- I'm a Ranger sir.
- That's good enough for me.

146
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,100
You've been released into our
care and reinstated... Captain.

147
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,500
Thank you sir.

148
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,000
Let's get the hell out of here.

149
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,300
You gorgeous old rust bucket
you, did you miss your daddy?

150
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,500
Face, what's the most important
part of a well oiled plan?

151
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,900
To be one step ahead of the enemy.
Not be running away from him.

152
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,000
- Who say's we're running away?
- What. We're going to go in this
dinosaur with this freak show?

153
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,100
You spin me right round
baby right round...

154
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,700
- Rotors are good sir.
- Who is this guy?

155
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,200
- Come on let's go.
- Murdock, get this thing in the air.

156
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,700
Hold on boys! I'm goin' to try
something I saw in a cartoon once.

157
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,100
What are you talking about cartoons
for? Get us the hell out of here!

158
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,700
We got a hot chopper to the six!

159
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm awesome boys! I'm awesome!

160
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,400
Oh heads up!

161
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,100
- I see you gringo.
- You pancaked my van!

162
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,700
- I'm going to kill you fool.
- You, you can't park there
that's a handicapped zone.

163
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,700
- I knew you were crazy! I knew you were crazy!
- This is a mistake

164
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,600
Fire! Fire! Fire!!

165
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,000
Low man's cut!

166
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,200
I've never done this before.

167
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,400
- Did you see that?!
- Did you see how he turned the helicopter?

168
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,500
- You got to love some good
air to air combat hey boys?
- Don't look at me look out there!

169
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,300
- He's only got heat seekers left!
- Captain, get us out of here!

170
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,700
Hold on this could get ugly. Here we go.

171
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,700
Come on... come on baby, climb.

172
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,400
- Fire the missiles!
- Whoah! Missiles.

173
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,700
Come on. That's how we deal
with heat seekers chaps!

174
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,500
We go cold.

175
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,700
Face, get him in here!

176
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,200
Oh shit!... Oh shit!!

177
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,200
- Get a hold!!
- Restart... restart...

178
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,000
Close the door! I know you're Airborn
Rangers but that was ridiculous!

179
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,500
You're going to be okay.

180
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,400
Boss, the idea's to kill
Tuco, not the other way around!

181
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,300
One step ahead of the
game isn't the plan kid.

182
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,300
Two to three steps ahead.

183
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,600
Beating an enemies move before
it's even made. That's a plan.

184
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,700
Hatchet, Hatchet. Lock on my LC.

185
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,700
General Tuco, you are currently
engaged in unauthorized

186
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,600
warfare on United States
military personnel.

187
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,400
No no no no no no. You engaged me!

188
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Repeat! You are engaged
in unauthorized warfare

189
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,900
on United States military personnel.

190
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,000
Over United States air space.

191
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,100
- What?
- Alpha, Mike...

192
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,500
Foxtrot!!

193
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,100
In other words... Adios! Mother Fu... !!

194
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,200
- Well done Captain.
- That was awesome!

195
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
- That wasn't awesome!
- You are a genius!

196
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,400
- I'm never flying again that's it.
- Oh! I never should have doubted you boss!

197
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,200
There's a plan in everything kid.

198
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,200
And I love it when a plan comes together.

199
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:39,600

corrected by chamallow [addic7ed]

200
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,300
Dung batter cooking nothing like it.

201
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,900
Face, you want it napalmed or nuked?

202
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,800
Oh nuke it... nuke it!

203
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,900
Murdock, burn the hell out of that thing.

204
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,600
- Like it was damned.
- Burn the whole place down buddy.

205
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,700
- You want secret sauce?
- No no no no no not antifreeze.

206
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,300
The secret sauce? You
crazy, everybody knows.

207
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,300
No one can do an antifreeze
marinade like you can Murdock.

208
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,200
But, I got a little bells
palsy the last time I ate that.

209
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,300
It's only partial paralysis.
Come on, take it like a man.

210
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,600
Yes sir, having that conversation
right now I've got it well in hand sir.

211
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,800
I don't think you want me to be in
the field partially paralyzed bud.

212
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,100
Visitors...

213
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah...

214
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
Wow. I'm a little taken
back I'm not going to lie.

215
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,700
- Lieutenant...
- Oh I'm sorry am I supposed
to call you Lieutenant back?

216
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,100
- No, you're supposed to call me Captain.
- Captain... Captain?

217
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,700
- That's right.
- Captain Crust. Look at you.

218
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,200
Wow! So I guess you said no
to the kids, no to the family.

219
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,600
- Just no ladder you can't climb huh?
- No honey, I just said no to you.

220
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,700
Hello my name's Percy
Would you like some pork?

221
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,600
If I broke every bone in your
hand could you still do that?

222
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,200
This is crazy, three years. We haven't seen each other
for three years.. this is what we're going to talk about?

223
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,200
What would you like to discuss?

224
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,500
- Did you take my Steely Dan CD?
- I'm not even going to respond to that.

225
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,400
We listened to it like
nine times in a row,

226
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,300
we were drinking that crappy
Cabernet remember that?

227
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,700
We were doing something
else... what were we doing?

228
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,000
Do you remember what it was we were doing?

229
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,900
It was in a bedroom... you don't remember?

230
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,000
The only thing I remember is leaving.

231
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,500
Which is... my fondest memory of you.

232
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,900
You guys are the best.
Stay out of trouble.

233
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,900
- You hear me?
- Take care.

234
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,100
Keep that on.

235
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,900
Colonel, my name is Lynch,
I'm with Central Intelligence.

236
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,700
I knew a company man named Lynch
back in the first Desert Storm.

237
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Yeah, I come from a long line of Lynches.

238
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,900
You ever stop to consider maybe
the reason nobody trusts the CIA

239
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,500
is because nobody knows your real names?

240
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,900
What can I do for you Mr. Lynch?

241
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,400
I need you to help me stop
Saddam's former flunkies

242
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,200
from stealing over a billion
dollars in the next thirty hours.

243
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,000
Now the only mint outside of the
US capable of printing our money,

244
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,500
belonged to the Shah of Iran. During
the Iran/Iraq war, it went missing.

245
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,300
Rumor was Saddam had stolen it.

246
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,300
And we stole it back during Desert Storm.

247
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,900
Well we didn't get the engravement plates.

248
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,800
That didn't matter. They would have had to
rebuild the mint just to print those bills.

249
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,100
Well sir, that's happening as we speak.

250
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,000
Thadine thugs have seized what's left

251
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,900
of the Iraqi national mint to
run off billions of dollars,

252
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,600
in unbacked American currency.

253
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,900
How are they planning on moving the plates
and a billion dollars out of Baghdad?

254
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,000
Armored convoy, manned with
former... Iraqi spec ops.

255
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,500
- Yeah.
- High speed shoot to kill types.

256
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,800
So how do you plan on stopping them?

257
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,200
Listen... there's some rumors
about some top secret plates

258
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,600
being smuggled out of the
city by Saddam loyalists.

259
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,400
Do you know anything about this?

260
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,100
Seriously, if you're going to make a play
for these plates I'm waving you off right now.

261
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,700
Because it's my
responsibility and it's my ass.

262
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,900
I'm serious... Face? I'm
court marshalling you.

263
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,900
Ooh... okay.

264
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,900
Hey! Get the memo.

265
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,000
Tell your beloved Colonel Smith.

266
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,300
And stay the hell out of Baghdad.

267
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,600
You know... you never came back. I
thought you were going to come back.

268
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,000
Well, this is me... coming back.

269
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,600
You think those clowns
could really pull this off?

270
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,100
Listen, listen I would never tell him this

271
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,000
but they are the best damn
section unit in the four branches.

272
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,400
- And they specialize in the ridiculous.
- Diablo!

273
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,200
I'm getting the rest of them. Do
not let them out of your sight!

274
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,300
- Doesn't Diablo mean devil?
- Yeah man!

275
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,200
God damn it Hannibal,
what do you want me to do?

276
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,700
If this were my operation and you
wanted it, you'd have the mission.

277
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,100
You let Black Forest deploy on this
and it's an international incident

278
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,500
I promise you. They're not soldiers...
They're frat boys with trigger fingers.

279
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,700
- Who's running the ground team?
- Brad Pike.

280
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:08,100
Pike? He's a thug... he's
a cartoon character, come on!

281
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,500
Hannibal we have been
ordered. Ordered, mind you,

282
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,200
to stay out of Baghdad.
Cut, dried, the end.

283
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,300
General, we should find him a
little wiggle room. Don't you think?

284
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,500
You know, I knew another Lynch CIA stooge.

285
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,200
Stationed in Laos '68.

286
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,600
No relation.

287
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,000
Are you sure? Because
you remind me of him.

288
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,700
I'm due in Kabul in a few hours.

289
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,900
Back here in 48 assuming
we're green and go.

290
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,700
Notify me otherwise.

291
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,400
He's wearing body armour in the HQ.

292
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,800
And that should tell you everything
you need to know about the CIA.

293
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,100
I want you to know this is not
about you losing a step Hal.

294
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,900
Hey, hey! I'm ten times the
man I was when you met me.

295
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,200
- And twice as fast.
- Uh huh.

296
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,000
Russ, the boys and I can get
this done minus the bloodshed.

297
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,100
Those plates can do all kinds of damage.

298
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,300
- Don't make me beg.
- I'd hate to se you beg Hal.

299
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,600
You've been my friend for a long time.

300
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,000
More importantly you and those boys have

301
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,100
possibly been the most
valuable military asset

302
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,700
I have ever had at my disposal.

303
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,800
Now... you asked me not to make you beg.

304
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,000
Right now I'm begging you.

305
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Hannibal... please...

306
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Let this one go.

307
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,700
Listen BA, we're extending
our stay a little bit.

308
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,600
We're going back into Baghdad.

309
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,900
I thought we was ordered
to stay out of Baghdad?

310
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,500
- That's true but I'm...
- Smith.

311
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,200
Pike.

312
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,700
I understand you and your grunts are
now stealing my gigs. I don't like that.

313
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,000
I figured you Black Forest guys would
be busy installing a dictatorship or

314
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,900
overthrowing a democracy somewhere.

315
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,600
It's still the weekend yet.
That's nine to five stuff... Pops.

316
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,200
Look at you clowns you're not soldiers.

317
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,000
You're assassins in polo shirts.

318
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
We make in a week what
you guys make in a year.

319
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Cash don't buy guts kid...

320
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,100
or brains.

321
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,600
And you're short on both.

322
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,400
This is Morrison's base. Bug out of my op.

323
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,200
I'm telling you, there's
a reason she came back.

324
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,100
Face, I told you forget about her.

325
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,400
- The level of ambition on this woman...
- I ain't stepping foot in any
type of aircraft Hannibal.

326
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,600
No gliders... paper planes ultralights.

327
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,800
- Are you ever going to let me live that down?
- No

328
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,400
Mexico was a long time
ago and I saved your life.

329
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
How about thanking me for not
whooping your ass at that hospital.

330
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,900
I was an Airborn Ranger until I met you.

331
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,800
- And you chickened out just like...
- 263 jumps.

332
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,000
- Just a thank you would have been nice.
- And one helicopter ride with you screws it up.

333
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
- Airborn Ranger with a
fear of flying... like a punk.
- B.A., for the last time.

334
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,100
Nobody leaves the truck
once we take it over.

335
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,500
Okay?

336
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,600
Staging, movement, action plan.

337
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,600
And here's a nice read for you.

338
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,300
Aw, hell yeah Hannibal,
this is it right here.

339
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,300
This is bat shit insane.

340
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,400
- It's perfect.
- I don't man... this is beyond nuts boss.

341
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It gets better.

342
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,800
BA, you'll need a piece of
contoured metal to make a skid plate.

343
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,000
- Let's go fool.
- Murdock, we'll need a car battery too.

344
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,400
See if the boys at Black
Forest can help us out.

345
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,500
Press credentials... we need them.

346
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,000
Hit the media tent.
See what's lying around.

347
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,100
Oy, my friend. I see you've put the
South African microphone at the bottom.

348
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
You can't always put the CNN on top.

349
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,400
There's two mike stands you
gotta make sure there's someone...

350
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,700
Murdock, we need a news camera.

351
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,000
See what you can do.

352
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,300
Hi sorry, uh... sorry
oh... sorry... sorry.

353
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,200
Hello I'm... I'm in love with you.

354
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,000
Listen.. we're doing preliminary
cov... of what are we talking about?

355
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,200
the pullout!

356
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,000
We're going to need airbags. Lots of them.

357
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,400
- Le Monde.

358
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,100
Oh, you're French...

359
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,500
- Hello this is General Parker I need...
- It's for you.

360
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,000
You can call an air strike on yourself.

361
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,600
- We're good mate... meet you back there.
- No, okay I think we need to get back to the...

362
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,000
I think you need to understand
what I'm telling you right now.

363
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,500
BA we're going to need a magnet.

364
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,000
Yeah!!

365
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,800
A powerful one.

366
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,700
Have you ever seen Blue Man group?

367
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,100
I'll pick up the rest.

368
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,300
I'm just going to go for it.

369
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,300
Ooh la la.

370
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,700
What would you give for one chance,

371
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,200
to come back here and tell our enemies,

372
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,100
that they may take our lives
but they'll never take...

373
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:40,200
our freedom!!

374
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Ready to go downtown? Good luck.

375
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,600
Give 'em hell.

376
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,200
General Morrison...
where is Hannibal Smith?

377
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,500
They go mobile in three hours.

378
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,600
The plates...

379
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,500
and over a billion dollars will be
loaded in the back of a semi at the mint.

380
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,500
They're over land for exactly 4.6
miles before they reach the bridge.

381
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,600
That's our window and it closes fast.

382
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,400
These guys will go weapons hot
at the first whisper of trouble.

383
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,200
Face, your point of
entry is under the hotel.

384
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,700
It will be packed with foreign
press and private security.

385
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,900
BA, you're in this
alleyway with a stopwatch.

386
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,400
- Make sure the bike is V twins or better.
- I got something a whole lot better.

387
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,200
What about me boss man?

388
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,600
I had a little helicopter here someplace.

389
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,900
You got some battle
rolls... some mid air stalls?

390
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,100
I'm looking for my next
near death experience.

391
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,600
Only on support this time Captain. But
I'll get you in on th next one... I promise.

392
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:25,500
BA, I need you to pop
that clutch at 06:30.

393
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,900
Is that me? Oh no I forgot I'm
in an Iraqi sewer. Thanks boss!

394
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,100
Timing... is everything Face.

395
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,800
This is all about the bulls-eyes.

396
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,100
Why not?

397
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,900
Under the semi, you will take
out the truck directly behind you.

398
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,600
Now these guys are going to be on to you
Face. BA that's your cue for throttle.

399
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,000
Be sure to look both ways before crossing.

400
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,400
And have a nice full tank of gas.

401
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,300
There will be multiple
hostiles on board BA.

402
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,200
Escort them from the premises.

403
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,100
If any stragglers sneak up behind
don't worry, I got your back.

404
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Got ya kid!

405
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,000
That's all fine in theory but I still
don't see how we get out of Baghdad.

406
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,300
I do.

407
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,500
- BA! Hang a right.
- All right, hang on!

408
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,700
- Watch out, watch out.
- Heads down.

409
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,800
Nice one BA!

410
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,500
Face, get the airbags!

411
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:42,300
Got to make sure this thing
stays locked for later.

412
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,400
Beautiful.

413
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,600
One... two... three.

414
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,300
Hey boss! The airbags do
deploy on impact right?

415
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,500
BA get in the container!

416
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,300
Contact rear!

417
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,300
Okay this is the part of
the plan I don't trust.

418
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,100
Don't worry Face, the ropes will hold.

419
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,900
If I was worried I'd be nailing
myself to the container right now.

420
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,600
Hang on boys!

421
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,900
Come on I smoked you! Did
you boys see that down there?

422
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,800
- Colonel!
- What is that fool doing here? Don't lock me in here.

423
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,200
Hey boss, you ever play that game at the fun fair
where you try to pick up a stuffed animal with the claw?

424
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,600
- This is a lot like that.
- Taking!

425
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,700
Did you lock this? !
You locked me in here!

426
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,200
- Would you... are you listening?!
- I got you.

427
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,700
- I'm going to kill you fool!
- Boss... is that Bosco?

428
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,800
- Get me out of here!!!
- Oh that's not good... he is not happy.

429
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,600
- Boss... we are in the net.
- Copy that.

430
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,700
I will be there in five I've got
a big bottle of blue label waiting.

431
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,800
A bottle? Make it a
case. See you in a few.

432
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,700
- Who's going to let him out?
- You!

433
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,200
What you don't realize is...
now I got to kill all y'all.

434
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,700
I'll kill all y'all!!!

435
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:10,600
Boss, maybe... let me try something.

436
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,400
Go for it.

437
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,200
Is it weird that I'm more
scared now than what we just did?

438
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,900
- Bosco... it's Murdock.
- Murdock open this door!!

439
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,200
I'll make you some of that coconut
curry tapenade that you love.

440
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,700
Ooh that might work.

441
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,100
- With toast points?
- Well hell yeah with toast points.

442
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,900
You thought we were going to
have that with plain old chips?

443
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,400
- You tricked me!
- There he is...

444
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,800
- Come on!
- Get away from me man!

445
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,000
My arteries just about... you should
know better! You know I hate flying.

446
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,000
I'm sweating! I stink! And I
can't spend none of that money.

447
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,700
- Money can't buy happiness.
- Damn man!

448
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,400
Hey Murdock, you cook it tonight!
You better get your apron on.

449
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,500
I love it when a plan comes together.

450
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,100
- Hannibal, who was that?!
- Was that the General?!

451
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,100
General! Ross?!

452
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,300
My God.

453
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,200
Pike.

454
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,400
Contact rear!

455
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,700
After conferring, we've decided to demote
you to the rank of first lieutenant.

456
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,800
Lieutenant Sosa, it's nothing
personal but you lost those plates.

457
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,500
- Those were your responsibility.
- Consider yourself lucky, others are going to

458
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,500
- prison over this.
- Good day Director MacReady.
Lieutenant, you're dismissed.

459
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,900
Colonel Smith, this court has been unable to
recover any direct order from General Morrison,

460
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,200
for you to conduct the mission
for which you're being tried.

461
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,100
Your Honor this was a covert operation
and no official orders were given.

462
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,200
So the one individual who could verify the legitimacy
of this operation is deceased. Is that correct Colonel?

463
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,100
No Your Honor, not deceased.

464
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,200
- General Morrison was murdered.
- Colonel, I've been on a long time

465
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,300
seen units like yours they're outlaws

466
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:04,900
units like that pose a direct threat to
the fabric and fundamentals of our military.

467
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,800
Your Honor, why hasn't Black
Forest been brought to trial?

468
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,100
Black Forrest and its personnel are
not subject to military jurisdiction.

469
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,800
Where's the plan boss?
Where's the escape package?

470
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,500
This mission isn't over Lieutenant.

471
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,200
I'll clear our names. We
find Pike and the plates.

472
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,800
No matter what.

473
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,200
Your Honors, these men were
acting under my command.

474
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,700
Any judgment should be levied
against me and me alone.

475
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,900
Absolutely not sir, we were all
participating in this operation willingly.

476
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,700
- I don't want to be tried separately.
- I refuse to be tried separately sir.

477
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,200
In accordance with the uniform
code of military justice

478
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,800
this court is rendering guilty verdicts
for each member of this Alpha unit.

479
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,700
Or 'A-Team'.

480
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,300
And mandating incarceration in
separate maximum security facilities

481
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,500
for a period of up to ten years. You
are all hereby stripped of formal rank.

482
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,400
and dishonorably discharged.

483
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,000
- This is bullshit man.
- This session is adjourned.

484
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:19,800
- At Black Forest what... ?
- You disgraced me.

485
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,600
- Absolute disgrace!
- Are you happy?

486
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,700
- Colonel, control your men!
- Get your hands off me!

487
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,300
Well hello Mr. Lynch. Long time.

488
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,000
You look very relaxed Lynch.
A lot of cameras in here.

489
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,700
Yeah there are. Yeah well, they seem to be
having some technical issues at the moment.

490
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,400
I may not show up until playback.
Hannibal, can I call you Hannibal?

491
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,400
Can't call you Colonel any more.

492
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,700
Six months been waiting for you.

493
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,800
Bust out of here and round up the rest of the
Backstreet Boys and lead me to those plates.

494
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,800
Six months and not a peep.

495
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,800
Everybody thought you and your
team were working with Pike.

496
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:32,400
Everybody except you.
Pike murdered Morrison.

497
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,000
Set me and my boys up
and stole those plates.

498
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,100
And I know where he is.

499
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,700
Nobody knows where he is.

500
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,200
There's a single image of him. Taken
about a month ago somewhere in Europe.

501
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,200
We think it's a grab from the CCTV camera.

502
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,200
Frankfurt, Germany.

503
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,500
- How did you get that in here?
- Time, Lynch.

504
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,800
Give me a minute, I'm good.
If I've got an hour, I'm great.

505
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,700
You give me six months, I'm unbeatable.

506
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,600
I know Pike, who's the Arab?

507
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,300
We don't know.

508
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,400
We think he's the 'Deep Dark'.
Hidden hand in this whole thing.

509
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,400
Maybe a broker, maybe a buyer.

510
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,300
Lynch, we have common enemies
and you have limited choices.

511
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,800
My team is still your best shot
at getting those plates back.

512
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,000
- I wouldn't be so sure?
- Then why did you make
the long drive out here?

513
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,800
You and your boys at Langley want
your own private printing press.

514
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,700
That's about as deep
as your patriotism goes.

515
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,400
So what would you need from me?

516
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,400
I swore to my team that
I would clear our names.

517
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,000
You of all people must
understand the value of a name.

518
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:04,100
Listen, I want full reinstatement and
clean records for myself, and my team.

519
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,600
I can't get you out here.
Not legally at least.

520
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,200
This is something the boys
in Langley do very very well.

521
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,000
Make sure the dosage is right.

522
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,100
And when I say right I mean perfect.

523
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,800
Cuban... what a shame.

524
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:25,200
You are not... permitted...
in... my... dojo!!!

525
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,900
So, Satan walks into this bar.

526
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,300
Wait a minute what's this?
A lap pool? A dry steam room?

527
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,900
Yeah. It will go a long way with the boys.

528
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,700
How in the hell do you pull this off?

529
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,600
- It's not who you know Bob,
it's how you know them.
- Oh, did your boy get back from Afghanistan?

530
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,600
Yeah thanks for getting him home.
His mother and I are real grateful.

531
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,300
- Captain...
- Hey

532
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,900
You left something on the bed.

533
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,900
- You could have hid those.
- Why would I want to do that?

534
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,100
Drive me crazy. I'll see you at eight.

535
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:08,200
- Hey LT thanks for the boots.
- Ah come on, it's my pleasure baby.

536
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,400
Smith has escaped Lieutenant.

537
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,500
Let me go after him.

538
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,500
Smith and his team are working
with Brock Pike and Black Forest.

539
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,000
I can get those plates back for you sir.

540
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,000
You know I can.

541
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,400
Holler what? Holler who?

542
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,200
Hey, hey! Let me out!

543
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,600
Hey, hey hey!!!

544
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,400
You are... really tanned.

545
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,100
Seal that up nobody goes in there.

546
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:06,400
Log in pages from day in
question have been removed.

547
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,700
- Why does that not surprise me?
- Torn out.

548
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,400
The cigar was in the spine of that book.

549
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,700
- Wow, subtle.
- Now, get this.

550
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,000
Now, this is surveillance from
all around the prisoner right?

551
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,300
Now what you're watching is a signal
jammer this is high tech stuff.

552
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,100
It sends a jamming signal in front of every
camera every time we might get a glimpse of him.

553
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,600
We see nothing. Nobody knows who he is.

554
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,300
Which begs a bigger question.
Did the CIA visit Smith in prison?

555
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,500
it sounds kind of crazy but
I think the CIA broke him out.

556
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,400
- Who put us on?
- The same guy who put us on in Baghdad.

557
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,700
Lynch, CIA.

558
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,800
What are we talking about?
Clean records? Reinstatements?

559
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,400
- All of the above.
- What about Pike? And the plates.

560
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,500
Payback.

561
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,600
- I take it you didn't get religion inside.
- No, I got revenge.

562
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,300
Good.

563
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,200
I know a couple guys that
will feel the exact same way.

564
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,900
I'm counting on it.

565
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:34,700
Emergency exit now... Hannibal.

566
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,100
Baracus! Don't do it!

567
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,000
Where's he going?

568
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,400
Baracus, god damn it!

569
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,900
- Sosa.
- Baracus and Peck are already gone.

570
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,300
- What?
- Murdock is the only one left, and he's in Germany.

571
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,700
How did you know that once that door was
extracted that it would take his weight.

572
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,300
- I just did, he's you know he's what 225... 230lbs?
- 230 yeah.

573
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,300
Do you remember the gag we did in...

574
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,800
- Venezuela seven years ago?
- Venezuela yeah, yeah yes.

575
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,400
But that was a midget.

576
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,200
- There he is.
- He's back.

577
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,600
- It's good to be back man.
- My man.

578
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,600
- It's good to see you brother.
- You too bro, you too.

579
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,100
- Thanks man.
- You're welcome.

580
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,000
Good to see you guys.

581
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,200
- What?
- Where's the mohawk?

582
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,700
What? You don't like my new do man?

583
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,900
Do I like it? We got you
the clippers, I thought...

584
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,300
Yeah I used them.

585
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,700
Hey, what's up big guy?

586
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,600
Come on, you can speak to us.

587
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,300
You guy's, hmm...

588
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,000
I can't kill anybody.

589
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,900
- What do you mean?
- I've taken a vow.

590
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:25,700
- Vow?
- I'll still do things with you guys. You know that.

591
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:31,300
But I just can't kill man.
Old habits may die hard but,

592
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,600
they still gotta die.

593
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,600
When I was a kid, all you'd
hear in the 'hood was...

594
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:43,100
Bosco's a bad ass out collecting scalps.

595
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,700
That's where the mohawk came from.

596
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,200
- I was always at war.
- That's what warriors are for.

597
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,900
I don't know man. I don't miss that life.

598
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,600
I'll help you get Murdock right
there ain't a problem, but...

599
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,200
- I can't kill.
- Even Pike?

600
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,900
- Even if killing him would clear your name?
- My conscience is the only thing I need.

601
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:10,800
Now, where is that crazy ass fool?

602
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,800
Hey Murdock, you got a
package from Annabelle Smith.

603
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,100
Wow it's so real.

604
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,900
I now knight you... sir you have to put
your head down. Stand up and do it again.

605
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,800
When you kneel put your
head down straight away.

606
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,000
Looking me in the eye is
disrespectful you understand?

607
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,200
Movie, movie...

608
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,600
You're looking me in the
eye now, that's wrong.

609
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:56,500
Movie, movie, movie. Movie, movie, movie.

610
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:02,500
Movie shit.

611
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,400
- Excuse me, can I help you with something?
- Yes, Captain Murdock. Where is he?

612
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,200
- Right through there.
- Thank you.

613
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,100
El Diablo...

614
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,500
Okay, , settle down. No
talking during the movie.

615
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,600
Captain Murdock. You
remember me? From Baghdad.

616
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,300
- Okay this is pointless, this guy is fried.
- Yeah, there's a reason why he's here.

617
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,700
And his entire team
has escaped except, him.

618
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,300
- Movie!

619
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:50,900
Take a look around anyway
just to make sure he's alone.

620
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,000
- Oh Captain! Your chariot awaits.
- Sorry boys, gotta run.

621
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,200
Can't finish the movie.
Do let me know how it ends.

622
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,200
Charisa where are you
hiding? Stay beautiful baby.

623
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,100
Get the truck!

624
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,500
- These guys are shooting at us!
- I can see these bullets in 3D!

625
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,100
- Get in here!
- It's like we're actually being shot at!

626
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,600
You are getting shot
at you crazy ass fool.

627
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,600
- Stop right there!
- Ram it!

628
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,800
Hey! I said halt!

629
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,200
Yaa whoo hoo hoo!

630
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,100
Damn! Sorry dude.

631
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,500
- It looks like they're heading for the tarmac.
- Lets go, let's go, let's go.

632
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,300
- Gentlemen.
- Holy shit!

633
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,400
Are any of you armed and/or
wanted federal fugitives?

634
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,300
- No.
- Well we're both, which means.

635
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,100
- You're taking the plane?
- And that's why I joined the army.

636
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,200
- Man up and get in there!
- Best and brightest, appreciate
it boys that will be all.

637
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,500
- Anyone got the keys? I just need the keys.
- What! What? What you talking about keys?

638
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,100
- I do need keys.
- For what? This is a bad idea.

639
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,200
We just broke this guy
out of the psych ward.

640
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,800
- Hannibal, you let the real pilots go?
- BA relax, you're going to be fine.

641
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,500
- Here take one of these.
- Will they knock me out?

642
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,900
They better knock me out.

643
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,800
- Cause if they don't I'm gonna knock you out.
- Bosco, the buttons are confusing me I don't...

644
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,900
- Shut up Murdock!
- Come on Murdock, let's go.

645
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,300
- I'm turning myself in.
- Come on, come on Murdock.

646
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,100
I got lucky.

647
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,900
Hang on boys.

648
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,900
Stop.

649
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,100
- Face, your girlfriend's back.
- Reverse now.

650
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,400
Move your ass!

651
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,600
- The C130 vs. the Mercedes Benz.
- Take us off Murdock.

652
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,700
- Faster!
- I've got it pinned!

653
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,400
Holy!

654
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,700
Get us to flight control.

655
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,900
Ladies and Gentlemen we are expecting slight
turbulence, please remain in your seats,

656
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,400
until the captain has turned
off the fasten seatbelt sign.

657
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,300
Don't worry boys! Turbulence
has never brought down a plane!

658
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,300
- What the hell is that?
- That...

659
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,600
We've got sub swirling
UAV's and missile lock!

660
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,700
And they bring down planes all the time.

661
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:10,000
Okay they're coming in
launching counter measures!

662
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,800
Did you see that? That's my dialed vision.

663
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,700
Hang on, Hold on! We're going over!

664
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,900
Murdock, what the hell are you doing?

665
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,400
Whooo hoo hoo! You boys remember Mexico?!

666
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,200
Ladies and gentlemen from the flight deck.
If you look out of the right hand side of

667
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:51,000
the aircraft you'll notice
that the right wing is on fire.

668
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,800
Tango, re-acquired.
Missile lock pending sir.

669
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:57,000
This is a DCIS Major, do
not shoot that aircraft down.

670
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,300
Scramble fighters and force them to land.
There are federal fugitives on that plane.

671
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,000
They've also stolen
property from the US Army.

672
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,300
Billy, Billy I need to get the O
scan view off my monitor right now.

673
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,100
Missile away sir.

674
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,500
We have shoot down. Hercules has
been intercepted and destroyed.

675
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

676
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,900
- I don't believe it.
- Sir we have chute deployment on the Beauford.

677
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,300
What?

678
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,900
I want these drones taken off line right
now! Whoever's running these drones... !

679
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,200
- Get me the direct line! Whoever...
- We gotta get these drone down,
I'm gonna be on bitch duty.

680
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,800
We need to get those men alive!

681
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,500
- Everybody okay?
- What are the chances they think we're dead?

682
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,800
- Not great!
- Tell me we ain't still on that plane.

683
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,700
We ain't on that plane.

684
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,700
Hannibal if we're under 20,000
feet we can still breathe right.

685
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:09,500
- What you talking about 20,000 feet!?
- Let's fire up the old weapon system.

686
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,300
Hey Bosco! It's a little stuffy.
I'm going to pop a window!

687
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:21,700
Yeah! What you got
bitches! ! What you got!!

688
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:25,900
Yeah!!

689
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,100
- Let me at them too Face, come on!
- Why are we in a falling can?!!

690
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,700
Because the plane exploded!!

691
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:34,700
- What? What?!! When?
- Recently, the Reaper shot it down.

692
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,500
What Reaper?!

693
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,400
- The flying ones that are still trying to kill us!
- I blame you Hannibal!

694
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,100
- Technically, we're not flying.
- I know, we falling fool!

695
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,900
Oh Jesus!

696
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,700
UAV2 has splashed down. We
just lost one of the drones.

697
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,300
Hannibal, we're in trouble!!

698
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,800
Awesome!

699
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,700
Face, get onto the main gun. There's a
lake a half mile away from this position.

700
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:15,000
- What the hell am I trying to hit?!!
- Trust me! Rotate the turret at 82 degrees!

701
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,400
Fire in the hole!

702
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,500
Yeah! Boom!

703
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,200
Fire!

704
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:31,100
- Is he trying to shoot down that other drone?
- No, they're trying to fly that tank.

705
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,800
- He's flying the tank!
- You can't fly a tank fool!

706
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,200
Rotate 16 degrees. Fire!

707
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,600
- Rotate 34 degrees. Now!
- Hannibal!!

708
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,300
Wait... Fire!!

709
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,400
- Control, we have lost UAV.
- Is that a confirmed hit?

710
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,400
Right turn full front and wait!!

711
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,600
- Murdock, close the hatch!
- Hatch! Okay!

712
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,700
Come on baby.

713
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,700
- I'm too young to die!!
- Boss! I'm aiming at nothing.

714
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,200
- Come on.
- It's been an honor gentlemen.

715
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,800
- Come on baby.
- The greatest ride is the last ride Colonel.

716
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,600
- Fire everything!!
- Come on baby!!

717
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Come on!!

718
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:11,200
All right busy bees, busy bees.

719
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,300
Guys you can take your coats off.

720
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,400
It's hot as hell in here.
Sweating like a whore in church.

721
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,800
- Sir?
- Yeah

722
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,800
Smith and his team were engaged
in a C130 over Mannheim, Germany,

723
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,600
by two Reaper drones.

724
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,100
I'm not sure if it's an encryption glitch

725
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,000
but it says that they
were shot down in a tank.

726
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,500
NORAD's calling it an exhale
but there's an afflicting report.

727
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,000
I'm sure there is.

728
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:37,400
We got a German housebrau
who says she saw a tank

729
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,300
driving up and out of lake Volgelstein
with a guy resembling Murdock.

730
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:44,900
- Excuse me! Which way to Berlin?
- Asking for directions to Berlin.

731
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,500
- That's impossible.
- Well this will be the second time

732
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:52,300
Smith has died this
week. Is that possible?

733
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,200
What have you got for me?

734
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:04,300
We just got the unscrambled composite
of Smith's visitor in prison.

735
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,900
But with no ID on the subject yet.

736
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,400
Hello handsome.

737
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,200
Wait, I've seen this person before.

738
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,800
I know this guy.

739
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,100
Baghdad.

740
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,600
Get me a clean patch to
Langley we're going fishing.

741
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:26,400
- I heard bits and pieces but...
- Sir?

742
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,100
- I have...
- I was talking.

743
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,800
Can you stop? I have a D.O. D
hardline from Lieutenant Sosa.

744
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,900
She's looking for Agent Lynch.

745
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,700
Yeah, he's not available... ever.

746
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,400
Agent Lynch, from Baghdad?

747
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,000
General Morrison's tent?

748
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,700
Out.

749
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,300
Why do we have her?

750
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,700
She's got a fantastic
personality, that's why.

751
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,700
With whom am I speaking?

752
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,800
This is Capt... uh Lieutenant
Sosa. Is this Agent Lynch?

753
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:00,500
- Sorry, I don't have a first name.
- Neither do I.

754
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,200
So what can I do you for Lieutenant?

755
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,500
I'm looking at an image of you from the
disciplinary barracks of Fort Carson.

756
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,700
She's hot.

757
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,300
Did you visit former Colonel
Hannibal Smith in prison?

758
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:19,800
I don't know what you're
talking about former Captain.

759
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,900
Agent Lynch, if you facilitated
Smith's escape and are

760
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,100
currently aiding and abetting him...

761
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,800
oh buddy...

762
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,000
If you could make
something like that stick,

763
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,500
your next promotion should
be in the five star range.

764
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,100
And if you're helping to
retrieve those engraving plates,

765
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:41,500
I'm going to have to go out
of my way to disappoint you.

766
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,400
I want her phones, her computers,
any support packages she operates.

767
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,900
I want to know everything. I want active
intercept ops on everything she's got.

768
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,800
I want every move monitored
from this moment forward.

769
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:04,000
- You realize she's D.O.D?
- I don't care if she's G.O.D, do it.

770
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,700
Boss, check this out.

771
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:11,500
We've tracked this photograph of
Pike to the Konigsbank in Frankfurt.

772
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,600
Our surveillance has him and
an unknown Arab making regular

773
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,000
trips from the train station to the bank

774
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,500
- all over the last month.
- Pikes getting sloppy.

775
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,700
Yeah but if we're on to him what
are the odds that Smith and his team

776
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:22,500
are on to Pike and the Arab too?

777
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,300
This is a direct pull-down
from the Pentagon's database.

778
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:28,100
There's absolutely no way Smith
and his team could have this stuff.

779
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:32,400
I think we should assume they have
more information than us at all times.

780
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,900
Pike has been moving the
stolen engraving plates to the.

781
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:37,600
Konigsbank tower in
Frankfurt over the past month.

782
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,700
Tomorrow the last of the cases
containing these plates will be

783
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,500
transferred to the Arab.

784
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:44,900
This will mark the only
time in the last six months

785
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,200
that all the plates have
been in one location.

786
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,200
It's our best and only
shot at getting them back.

787
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,900
They leave the Konigsbank tower
for the 7:15 train to Zurich.

788
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:58,700
Gentlemen, we're going to
make sure they miss that train.

789
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,600
- Face.
- Yeah.

790
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,800
Time to bring in your former flame.

791
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,500
If she's as good as I think then
she'll be on her way to Frankfurt

792
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:09,300
to intercept those plates.

793
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,100
Why would you tip her off?

794
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,400
She's a crusader and we're
going to need her at some point.

795
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,500
Keep your eyes and ears open boys.

796
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,800
Now the wrinkle. If Sosa's on to us

797
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,400
we can assume that Lynch is on to her.

798
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,300
And if he thinks she stands
between him and those plates,

799
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:35,200
he won't hesitate to kill her.
Face, get to the train station.

800
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,200
This is Sosa.

801
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,800
If there's a threat
from Lynch deal with it.

802
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,500
Hello?

803
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,500
Shooter's green, say
again... shooter's green.

804
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,500
Hello?

805
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,400
Something's wrong.

806
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,500
We're marked guys, pull back.
I don't like this at all.

807
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:07,100
See, don't be seen.

808
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,600
- Hello beautiful...
- You've got some balls you
put a drop phone on me?

809
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,200
I had to baby, it's the only way I could
talk to you. Lynch has all your comm lines.

810
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,500
- I want you to pull your team now.
- I'm going to find you Face.

811
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,400
But do not engage her
or anyone else directly.

812
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,700
Not if I find you first.

813
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,700
Oww !! Jesus.

814
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,200
- What the hell are you doing?
- Trying to save you.

815
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,600
Charisa, come on you know we're innocent.

816
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,000
- You know this.
- You're lying.

817
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:55,200
- Like you lied in Baghdad.
- I did not, no I knew nothing about the plates.

818
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,800
At that... at that time.

819
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,700
You are completely full of shit!

820
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,300
Would you stop selling yourself on that
voiding the fact that you lied to me.

821
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,500
- When?
- Oh come on, you want to go there?

822
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,500
Okay you heard I was in
play and you wanted to play.

823
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,600
- Then I got serious, and you freaked!
- Oh I freaked?

824
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:16,200
- I did not freak!
- You panicked, and you ran.

825
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:27,000
Charisa, come on, I am a federal
fugitive, you know exactly how wanted I am.

826
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:30,800
You think I came to Frankfurt to
hash out some old heart break, no.

827
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,300
I'm here because we didn't do this.
I'm here because we were set up.

828
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,700
I'm here because in the end
the truth is worth the risk.

829
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:44,400
And I believe in you even
if you don't believe in me.

830
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,100
God, I forgot how beautiful you are.

831
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,600
Hold on to that phone.

832
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,200
Sucker.

833
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:23,200
- Oh shit, where's Peck.
- Excellent question, find him!

834
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:35,900
Okay, let's dance... coming
down positions, prepare to move.

835
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,500
As always, stay close to me sir.

836
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,400
- I can't see anything.
- How we doing there big man?

837
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:08,700
- Murdock, here comes the Arab.
- It's a long drive deep into left center field.

838
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:13,500
Murdock is back, he's at the
wall and he makes the catch!

839
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:39,800
BA, I lost the case. I'm
taking fire, I'm out of here.

840
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,900
BA, get to those plates.

841
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:46,000
A bunch of federals responding to explosions
and shots fired at the Konigsbank building.

842
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,700
All right get us out of this place and
to that building as soon as possible.

843
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,500
Whooo.

844
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:11,500
You made me work for this one Baracus.
I didn't think I was this out of shape.

845
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:16,300
I am unfortunately. Where's
the rest of the team huh?

846
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:22,000
Smith, Peck, that idiot pilot,
the asshole. What's his name?

847
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,600
I'm gonna take this one out on your
ass Baracus, let's see what you got.

848
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,300
- Come on, what are you doing? Are you tired?
- I'm not going to hurt you man.

849
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:41,000
No you're not going to hurt
me I'm going to hurt you.

850
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,900
I don't want to kill you man.

851
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,900
You don't want to kill me, you're not going
to kill me. I'm going to kill you Baracus.

852
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:52,600
- I'm not playing with you Pike.
- Here we go, 'cause I've got two guns, one
is on my left here, remember that, right?

853
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,100
As soon as that hammer goes back, it's on.

854
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:59,000
- I swear to God I'll do it.
- You're not a killer, are you?

855
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:02,100
Are you?

856
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,500
- Whoopsie.
- Damn!

857
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:09,700
- You all right big fellow?
- You're a lifesaver man, I couldn't shoot him.

858
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:21,300
Get out of the way!

859
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,100
- US Military, we got him.
- Yeah, this is about the right amount of cops.

860
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:57,000
That's cute. You're lucky
there are people around.

861
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,400
No sweetheart, you're lucky.

862
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:08,500
All right, not a peep out of the Arab.

863
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,300
Sosa was at the train station.

864
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,500
- You saw her?
- Yeah.

865
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,000
- Did you talk to her?
- I had no choice okay just...

866
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,700
- trust me on that.
- Oh I trust you...

867
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,800
to make historically bad decisions
where women are concerned.

868
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,200
What part of you is
thinking at the moment?

869
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,800
Well Lynch's men moved in
on her and I had to react.

870
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:31,100
- Please, somehow I doubt that.
- Hey, what are you so pissed about?

871
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:34,100
We got the plates, you wanted
her teed up, she's teed up.

872
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,400
She knows we didn't steal them.

873
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,000
She'll be thrilled to find out who did.

874
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:45,300
- What?
- He had to know.

875
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,900
You had to know.

876
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:54,200
You had to know if you left
me alive that this was coming.

877
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:01,800
How could you not?

878
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,200
Hannibal?

879
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,000
Do you know who this is?

880
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,300
We all do.

881
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,400
- Morrison?
- Oh, hell no.

882
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,400
Jesus Christ.

883
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:35,500
Not so sure that it is a blessing
but, good hunting my friend.

884
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:40,400
- Thank you.
- You son of a bitch.

885
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:48,200
Morrison, holy shit.

886
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:53,700
Outside, all of you. Outside now!

887
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:59,000
I knew if Lynch helped me
escape, you had to be part of it.

888
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:05,800
You and Pike were making a play on those
plates with Lynch, and you turned on him.

889
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:10,900
- The way you turned of us.
- Lynch was never going to cut us in.

890
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:16,800
He was going to use us he
brought you on as insurance.

891
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:21,000
You never thought you'd betrayed
your oldest living friend?

892
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,500
I just hit first Hannibal.
I'm a fighting man.

893
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,600
You're a liar and a traitor.

894
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,300
You knew Morrison was masquerading
as the Arab. Why not share that?

895
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,800
- I wasn't one hundred percent sure.
- How about ninety nine percent?

896
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:36,800
Would you think it was
worth mentioning then?

897
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:41,000
Lynch, what did you think? Did you
think I would just kill him on the spot?

898
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:43,100
Well I was certain of it I still am.

899
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,900
- Do you have the plates?
- I wouldn't be calling you if I didn't.

900
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:51,900
Smith, return the plates, kill
Morrison and reclaim your lives.

901
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:55,700
I want signed and authorized
Amnesty agreements for myself

902
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,500
and for each of my men,

903
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:01,500
from the White House, the State
Department and the joint Chiefs of Staff.

904
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,700
You hear me?

905
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:09,500
- Well I'm going to need a little more time.
- How much?

906
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:18,900
- Give me five minutes.
- I'm waiting.

907
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:39,600
I saw your tomb at Arlington.

908
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,700
You died a National hero.

909
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:56,600
Death is too easy.

910
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,600
- And the last thing we need is another lie.
- Don't do this, Hannibal please.

911
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:04,400
- You owe me that much.
- You owe me!

912
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:08,900
You're going to tell them
we're innocent. You owe me.

913
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,700
Hannibal, it's meaningless
what are you fighting for now?

914
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,300
You and those boys.

915
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:20,100
Your rank, your reputation. They're shit!

916
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:25,700
You're convicts, plates or no
plates you're federal fugitives.

917
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:29,400
And when they're done with you
Hannibal, they'll just burn you.

918
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,200
Zulu 1 Zulu, 1 this is broadsword
you are clear to engage.

919
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,800
Broadsword? Did you come up
with that? That's awesome.

920
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,500
Boss could you do that?

921
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,900
To us What Morrison did?

922
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:54,800
No, I'd rather Face a firing
squad than betray you boys.

923
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,100
Yeah but you didn't see it coming though.

924
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:03,400
No I... I didn't see it coming.

925
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,400
Move!

926
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:24,100
Wow, that's awesome.

927
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,700
That looks exactly like
Call of Duty doesn't it.

928
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:31,000
All right here's the deal, no press release
keep local law enforcement and media off site.

929
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,500
Get a three mile quarantine
dead over the no fly zone.

930
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:38,400
Get me an agency scrub team out there
and get me the God damn plates back.

931
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:44,000
The German police have your entire
team in custody in Konigsbank Tower.

932
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:49,300
I don't do teams babe, that's
Smith's bag. I'm strictly a solo act.

933
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:04,700
I like to travel light. Stuff like uh...
loyalty doesn't fit in the overhead bins.

934
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I thought you and Smith
were working together.

935
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,000
You thought wrong.

936
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,800
Yes we have weapons.
No, you may not wand us.

937
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:18,200
You want a deal? I'll make you a deal.

938
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:22,800
How about I dedicate my immediate future

939
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:27,700
- to destroying yours?
- How about you get smart

940
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:31,600
and start dealing before
somebody else does.

941
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,700
Former Captain. Whoa, whoa whoa.

942
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,000
Unless you've got a piece of paper
that looks exactly like this one,

943
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,900
then this troubled young
loner belongs to me.

944
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,000
Let's go.

945
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,800
How the hell did they
get an extradition order?

946
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,100
Sorry Pike, at least
with me there are rules.

947
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,900
The CIA's got rules. Our rules
are just cooler than yours.

948
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:54,500
Go.

949
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,800
You know Lynch, if I could
seal this room with you inside,

950
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,800
I'd be doing the world a big favor.

951
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,900
That's not nice.

952
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:05,600
- Answer me.
- Stay close to the fires boys.

953
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,500
If that gun ship is still around
it won't read our body heat.

954
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:13,500
Idiot Lynch, was so quick to kill
us didn't bother locating the plates.

955
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,600
Where do we stand in non violence now BA?

956
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,900
Are you pissed? You should be.

957
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:22,000
Who gives a shit about the plates?
Morrison was the only way to clear us,

958
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,900
and without Morrison, we got nothing.

959
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,200
- What do we do boss?
- I don't know Murdock.

960
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,300
- I don't know.
- I do.

961
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:35,900
This guy Lynch, I think
I've got him figured out.

962
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,400
- You got a plan kid?
- How do we get out of here?

963
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,200
Give me twenty minutes.

964
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,500
So Morrison's dead Smith
and his team are dead.

965
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,400
Another fifteen minutes or so
we'll locate those engraving plates.

966
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,000
- This is you gloating?
- No this is me beating you.

967
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,600
After you burned me.
We had a deal, remember?

968
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,600
- Not you and me.
- You, me and Morrison.

969
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:04,100
- Not you and me directly.
- And you two collude and cut me out?

970
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:09,000
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Are we going to do this in the car?

971
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:13,200
- He's going to do it?
- Way to go, that's brilliant right there.

972
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:17,500
- What are you doing? What is he doing?
- How's it going Kyle, are you all right?

973
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,500
- I'm good.
- Brother you are far from good.

974
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:23,800
What are you doing?

975
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,000
It's a suppressor counter clockwise.

976
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,800
You're holding a gun like that?
You've held a gun like that before

977
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,500
and you're still here? That's amazing.

978
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:34,000
Jesus, hey, final request don't
let this guy shoot me please.

979
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:44,200
- So if Sosa knows we're alive.
- She'll think Morrison's alive too.

980
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:47,900
Let's just hope that Lynch
still has Sosa's comm line.

981
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:55,000
- This is Sosa.
- General Morrison is in my possession.

982
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,600
What? I'm sorry I can't
hear you who is this?

983
01:21:57,900 --> 01:22:01,200
- Okay this was not well thought out.
- No shit?

984
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,700
I mean I gotta teach you how to
kill me hey, do me a favor all right?

985
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,400
- Put the barrel, put the gun flush to my head.
- Are you sure?

986
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:10,900
- There you go, right there.
- Is that going to go right through?

987
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,400
We're okay.

988
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,000
Never cuff a man ia a seated position
with his hands behind his back

989
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
makes it impossible to see the hands.

990
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,800
- That was cool.
- You liked that?

991
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:24,700
Oh I liked that, I liked that a
lot. Are you all right, you idiot?

992
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,300
- Yeah it was a good hit.
- Please handcuff him.

993
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,600
We don't need to use them
again we don't need the cuffs.

994
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,800
Who are you talking to?

995
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:34,100
Brad, phone or gun phone or gun, pick.

996
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:38,100
- Put the gun down.
- Hey, I didn't burn you, Morrison did.

997
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:41,400
- I really want to shoot you.
- You've got to hear this sir.

998
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,400
- Is this Smith?
- I'm a former Colonel to a former Captain.

999
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:48,600
I know I've got about thirty
seconds before you lock this signal.

1000
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,800
So listen, we can prove our innocence.

1001
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:56,600
Okay now go back to.. did you say you
have Morrison? You have General Morrison.

1002
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,700
- Correct.
- You have him alive?

1003
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,100
And well.

1004
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,300
That's why Lynch is trying
to wipe us out wholesale.

1005
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:06,600
Too much to explain now, but
Morrison's testimony frees us,

1006
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:09,300
and fries Lynch.

1007
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:11,500
Uh Oh.

1008
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:15,700
- Well not without the plates.
- Also in my possession.

1009
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,300
Remember, Lynch thinks we're dead

1010
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,400
- and I want to keep it that way.
- Give me a pen.

1011
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,100
You still use a pen?

1012
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:27,700
LA docks, 48 hours, dawn. If I
deliver Morrison and the plates.

1013
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:32,400
In return, I want a re-trial
in front of a civilian court.

1014
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,400
All right we'll deal. LA
docks 48 hours from now.

1015
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:41,300
Any bullshit from your end
and that's it, deals off.

1016
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:46,400
- Did we get him?
- No.

1017
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:52,100
Pike, do you believe in second chances?

1018
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,800
Ahhh... I do now.

1019
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
- Too much?
- I thought you were spot on.

1020
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,900
My turn.

1021
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:15,200
Hold on to that phone.

1022
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:26,200
- This is Sosa.
- Hello, beautiful.

1023
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:28,900
Thank you.

1024
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:38,100
Well they got the raw end
of the deal, didn't they?

1025
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:41,500
Look at BA He looks like a huge banana

1026
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:44,700
- Good morning my friend.
- Good morning.

1027
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,200
Rabbi Binky Rabinowits?

1028
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:56,600
- What passport did I give you?
- You are from Tanzania?

1029
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:00,100
- My mother is from Tanzania.
- Oh shit, what the hell happened?

1030
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:12,100
Converting.

1031
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,700
Let's go right into move.
There's three to my right.

1032
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:17,400
There's two behind me and
one at the northeast exit.

1033
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:28,400
Shalom.

1034
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,200
- There is a God.
- You speak Swahili?

1035
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,700
You don't?

1036
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,700
You got enough to work with kid?

1037
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,700
We will, you and I have some
major favors moving across

1038
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:46,800
the Atlantic right now.

1039
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,000
Some deep sea freighters with
some strictly black market merch.

1040
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,400
How do we get out to her?

1041
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,200
A boat, a plain old boat. That's
what I'm talking about Murdock.

1042
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:57,800
I'm talking overseas in style. That's
how I like to travel, classy like.

1043
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,700
These things are safe,
we don't need planes.

1044
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:04,400
You know Bosco, hopefully one day
we'll get you over your fear of flying.

1045
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:10,900
- Hey, that ain't no boat!
- That did it.

1046
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,800
Murdock just remember what I
said I said you have to catch him,

1047
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,500
after you inject him.

1048
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,400
My bad.

1049
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:50,200
Oh dammit! My head man.

1050
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
- Coconut curry tapenade, your favorite.
- Give me that fool.

1051
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,400
You got them toast points?

1052
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:02,700
Voil! Toast points.

1053
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,300
You had to knock me out again huh?

1054
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:12,400
Okay now, the whole injection
knocking out, Hannibal and Face.

1055
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:15,900
The curry tapenade, Murdock.

1056
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:21,200
Why do I feel like I fell
on my face huh? Tell me that.

1057
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:27,200
Lynch's paradox... Murdock,
are you done with that?

1058
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:32,500
This a guy who needs anonymity.
But he love the attricountaby.

1059
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,800
He's an administrator,
he's not an operator.

1060
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:41,100
Where is it?

1061
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:46,500
Very nice. So he stays as far away
from the point of impact as possible

1062
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:49,100
and never gets his hands
dirty if he can help it.

1063
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,900
But we're going to change all of that.

1064
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:53,700
You can't hustle a hustler fool.

1065
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:58,800
No sparks, no flames not even
a flashlight near this stuff.

1066
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:05,200
This guy's never at the
flashpoint of everything.

1067
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:10,600
He's safe and sound
somewhere pulling the strings.

1068
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,700
Mama mama.

1069
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:14,800
Hey boss, why so many of
these damn things anyway?

1070
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:19,400
Because overkill is underrated my friend.

1071
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:23,200
So we're going to bring this
guy down to ground level.

1072
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:27,400
Mama. Lynch.

1073
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:31,300
The last place he'd ever want to be.

1074
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,800
And you put him on display
for the whole world to see.

1075
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:38,700
Any questions?

1076
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:44,400
- What's up boss man?
- Hey, BA.

1077
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:50,800
- This is going to get heavy isn't it?
- Well, I can't promise you it won't

1078
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,000
I'm going to read you
something real quick.

1079
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,400
Victory attained by violence

1080
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:01,600
is tantamount to defeat
for it is momentary.

1081
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:04,100
Ghandi.

1082
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:07,600
It is better to be violent if
there is violence in our hearts

1083
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:12,700
than to put on the cloak of
non-violence to cover impotence.

1084
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:17,100
- Who said that?
- Same guy.

1085
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:21,700
Ghandi wasn't afraid to fight
for the things he believed in.

1086
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:25,400
What is it you believe in BA?

1087
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,000
What's wrong?

1088
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,700
I don't know man, just
thinking about this.

1089
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:56,300
We've always come back
alive the four of us

1090
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:58,200
because of the old man.

1091
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,600
- I know.
- I'm not him.

1092
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:05,000
- Face, I know this.
- Murdock, I'm not Hannibal.

1093
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:12,600
Who has the most to lose on
this Face? Me, and I trust you.

1094
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:19,300
Yeah I know but that... you're crazy.

1095
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:26,300
Not that crazy.

1096
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,000
All eagles may have landed
everybody ready to roll?

1097
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Copy, team one on the move.

1098
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,600
Acknowledged, team two en route.

1099
01:30:55,100 --> 01:31:00,000
All right guys, everybody ready?
The curtains about to come up.

1100
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,100
Showtime.

1101
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:11,600
That's Smith right there, watch him.

1102
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:16,400
- All teams in position?
- Standing by.

1103
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,300
In position.

1104
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,800
- Shoot team one affirmative.
- Spotter 1, 10-8.

1105
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,500
Less chatter, mark on comms now
Morrison's the primary tango,

1106
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:31,400
- the plates are the package.
- Yeah?

1107
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:35,100
Okay, okay, he's talking
to Sosa, I want this call.

1108
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:37,200
You lied to us we had a deal!

1109
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,800
I want that god damn
call in my... thank you.

1110
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:43,700
- We had a deal but I'm changing the deal.
- Are you kidding me Sosa!

1111
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:46,600
This is a complicated exchange
and you have no play here.

1112
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:50,100
Listen, or remain at large
fugitives for the foreseeable future.

1113
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,900
- No, no no no.
- I've got Morrison here with the plates!

1114
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:55,100
I'm exposed Sosa, exposed!

1115
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,700
We're not doing this on the docks.

1116
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:59,300
Now listen to me, we're
not turning ourselves in.

1117
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:01,000
Now you listen to me, we're
not turning ourselves in.

1118
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,300
I need you to do it on my
terms, or nothing at all.

1119
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,200
To hell with that, to hell with you Sosa!

1120
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:06,700
Ahh... she burned him.

1121
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:09,900
Face, B.A we're booking
out. Sosa shafted us.

1122
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:13,700
Murdock, get the chopper down here in ten.

1123
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:17,000
Okay, he's moving him you
got him, he's moving him.

1124
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,100
For the love of god, relax.

1125
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:20,800
I am relaxed, he's moving him.

1126
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:23,500
Don't do this Hannibal, please.

1127
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:24,400
There, that's Morrison
right there. Take him!

1128
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,300
Vance!, does he have the plates?

1129
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:27,400
Smith has the plates go now!

1130
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,700
I've got Morrison taking the shot.

1131
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:36,300
- A little too close for comfort kid.
- What just happened?

1132
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,500
What the hell is he doing?

1133
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:39,800
Where are they? Somebody talk to me.

1134
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:43,400
Come on, did that thing
crush them or what?

1135
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:47,200
Oh, this was a hell of a lot easier
when it was just three plastic cups.

1136
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:54,000
Everybody just be cool, pay
attention, no hasty moves.

1137
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:58,500
So you beat a guy like Lynch by
drawing him in with three things.

1138
01:32:58,700 --> 01:32:59,900
What the hell are they doing?

1139
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:03,800
Distraction

1140
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:04,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1141
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,100
What is happening?

1142
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,800
Diversion.

1143
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:17,300
This is a diversion stay
eagle on those containers.

1144
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,500
They're making for the exits, open fire!

1145
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:21,800
- Do not engage! Back off!
- All teams engage.

1146
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,600
Holy shit!

1147
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:35,200
You are being played
by Smith. He's trying to

1148
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:37,800
draw your eye line
Lynch. Come on, be smart.

1149
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,100
Take him, take him, take him!

1150
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:46,100
Contact! Tower house and
bow. It's Peck and Baracus!

1151
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,200
And evasion.

1152
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:58,600
It's a trap! Pull back! Fall
back! Get the hell out of there!

1153
01:33:58,600 --> 01:33:59,800
No, no, no

1154
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,400
What is happening? What is going on?

1155
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,100
Nice one kid.

1156
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:11,900
- It's Peck and Baracus.
- Shoot the...

1157
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:15,100
- Shut up I know what I'm doing.
- Okay paint-ballers, time to go pro.

1158
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:21,200
BA, get to your secondary position.

1159
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:25,900
Okay, game-changer... here's what
I think of your best laid plans.

1160
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:33,100
Shit

1161
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:34,900
Jesus Christ!!

1162
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:38,700
- So much for the grand scheme Smith.
- What the hell was that?

1163
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,000
- Face, what the hell was that?
- I think this ships going to blow.

1164
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,600
- He punched a hole in the hull!
- What about the plan?

1165
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:47,200
Pike just blew up the
plan we are ad libbing!

1166
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,300
- Bosco, get out of there!
- I'm going for Hannibal!

1167
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:53,500
- Cover me, I'm going for those plates.
- Yes sir.

1168
01:34:56,100 --> 01:35:01,500
- The boat's going over get out of there!
- Face hang on!

1169
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:50,900
Bosco, Pike's got the high ground
I'm running low on ammo man.

1170
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:03,100
Shit!

1171
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:08,500
How are you doing handsome? Shit
can you cycle that weapon, nice work.

1172
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:11,600
Geez, close friends and bullets.
Where are they when you need them?

1173
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:20,400
Don't take this too personally but uh...
look here, smile, and wait for the flash.

1174
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,100
Baracus!

1175
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:37,600
Bosco!

1176
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,800
Lynch.

1177
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,900
Lynch.

1178
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:04,100
Come on Lynch.

1179
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:07,600
Lynch.

1180
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:15,600
- Come on Smith, stop bullshitting.
- Come on Lynch.

1181
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:23,300
Lynch... where am I?

1182
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,800
Come on Lynch.

1183
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:30,800
Lynch.

1184
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:33,700
Where am I Lynch!

1185
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:39,700
Lynch... Lynch... Lynch Lynch... Lynch.

1186
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:43,700
Lynch!!

1187
01:38:56,700 --> 01:39:01,200
There you are Hannibal. I've
been looking all over for you.

1188
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:04,200
Hey, don't let the scarf fool
you. My Muay Thai is pretty good.

1189
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,900
Jujitsu's a little better
but I got this whole...

1190
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:12,400
slight of hand thing going with
the containers and the cars...

1191
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,000
and the fireworks. Lynch, Lynch, Lynch.

1192
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:20,500
God that's annoying. But
you give Pike a rocket...

1193
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:24,100
there's your monkey wrench.

1194
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:25,900
Hannibal don't do this.

1195
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:29,200
You know Smith, you could have
the best recipe in the world.

1196
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:32,700
- You owe me that much.
- But you drop a few bullets in the batter.

1197
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:33,800
- Hannibal don't do this.
- Lynch, no!

1198
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,800
And that cake don't bake.

1199
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:45,200
Uh oh, your witness,
your gun... your problem.

1200
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:52,600
You served your country well. Excuse me.

1201
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:58,400
Ahh hello Ben. Where
have you been all my life?

1202
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,700
Hannibal, you're slowing down,

1203
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:08,000
and bleeding, you're bleeding?
Da da da don't get up.

1204
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,100
God damn it!

1205
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:19,800
Your Muay Thai is as bad
as your Jujitsu Lynch.

1206
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:23,300
You better stick with a gun.

1207
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:27,300
You put a loaded weapon in my hand.
I'm going to put a bullet in your head.

1208
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,100
I told you I would shoot you.

1209
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,400
Kevlar saved your life. The thing is...

1210
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,600
doesn't do much good if
I pop you in the head.

1211
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,400
It does if you melt it down.

1212
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,600
Hannibal don't do this. Hannibal please.

1213
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,700
See you beat a guy like that by
drawing him in with three things.

1214
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,100
- Distraction.
- Whoa whoa what is happening?

1215
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:06,200
- Diversion.
- Division.

1216
01:41:09,700 --> 01:41:13,800
And you put him on display
for the whole world to see.

1217
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,100
That's good.

1218
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:37,100
Surprise.

1219
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:40,800
- Agent Burris.
- What did you call me?

1220
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:43,200
Agent Vance Burris isn't that your name?

1221
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:46,800
At least that's the name I've got
on this warrant here. Unless you have

1222
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:51,400
a piece of paper that
looks exactly like...

1223
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:54,200
No, that wouldn't help you either.

1224
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,400
Easy, easy.

1225
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:01,300
You're under arrest for attempted murder
violations of the civil false claims act

1226
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:05,800
and theft of top secret
government engraving plates.

1227
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:12,600
Well I guess the plan went okay.
Considering Pike didn't blow up the boat

1228
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:14,700
which I didn't account for at all.

1229
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:17,000
The bullets didn't go through.

1230
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:24,400
- How are you feeling man?
- Not... not good... not good.

1231
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,400
I feel sane.

1232
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,500
I should have shot you in
the head a long time ago.

1233
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:33,700
Okay Agent Burris, that will be
all. Take him out of here guys.

1234
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:43,100
What's the difference between
a concussion, and a contusion?

1235
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:48,400
Murdock that was beautiful, you were right.
The helmet worked, ketchup worked great.

1236
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:51,600
You did a great job are you okay?

1237
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:56,600
Got your bell rung? Just let
Hannibal make the plans next time.

1238
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:01,100
- Oh... Okay.
- How's the conscience big guy?

1239
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:05,400
At peace.

1240
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
- Which one of you is Sosa?
- I am.

1241
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:24,300
As of right now, your prisoner is
to be remanded into federal custody.

1242
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:26,600
- I have a warrant for this man's arrest.
- As of right now...

1243
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:29,800
I'm a doctor, I'm going to help
you out. Hey you need stitches?

1244
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:32,400
Please tell me you need stitches.
I could stitch you up really good.

1245
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,500
Gentlemen.

1246
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:41,100
Central Intelligence Agency believes
in and invensys a crown moral ethic

1247
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:43,400
as well as an unshakable
professional standard.

1248
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:49,500
As such, we would like to extend our most
sincere apologies for what's happened here.

1249
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,800
- Good day and god bless.
- Where are you taking him?

1250
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,500
Who?

1251
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,500
I never got your name.

1252
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:11,000
- My name in Lynch.
- Of course it is.

1253
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:15,800
Did he just say Lynch.

1254
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,600
- Easy guys.
- Everybody, stand down.

1255
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:34,800
Control this place.

1256
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:41,000
When did you arrive I had no idea...

1257
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:42,900
Yes sir.

1258
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:46,500
Get your hands off me tough guy.

1259
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:52,400
Well that's one hell of a
mess. But we did get the plates.

1260
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:57,000
But unfortunately, I'm going to have to
charge you all with escaping lawful custody.

1261
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:59,000
What?! Hannibal what is
this guy talking about?

1262
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
We were wrongly convicted but it's
still illegal to break out of jail.

1263
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Director, Smith and his men were
instrumental in recovering the plates.

1264
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,900
They're still level ten fugitives
and I need that off my desk.

1265
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:10,800
This is chicken shit sir.

1266
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:14,100
Well perhaps for them, it is chicken
shit, but for you... Captain...

1267
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:16,600
we're re-promoting you
to your former rank.

1268
01:45:16,600 --> 01:45:19,700
So look, they're going to be delivered
to the US Marshalls here in Long Beach,

1269
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:25,600
- I understand sir but...
- This needs to be done!

1270
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:28,300
I'm a Harry Houdini.

1271
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,600
- Let's go keep moving.
- Stop, wait.

1272
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:39,200
- This is so wrong.
- Don't worry about it.

1273
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:41,500
I'm going to do
everything I can to fix it.

1274
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:45,900
- I know you will.
- I'm so sorry Face.

1275
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:21,000
Nice plan Face.

1276
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:25,000
Yeah, we just traded Lynches
and we're going back to prison.

1277
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
We returned the plates, we can hold
our heads high, we did the right thing.

1278
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,600
Yeah after what they did
to us. This is bullshit.

1279
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:36,000
They burned us again Hannibal. We
trusted the system and it turned on us.

1280
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:39,900
Remember boys, no matter how random
things might appear, there is still a plan.

1281
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:44,000
Kid...

1282
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,300
Well, I don't mean to steal
your line boss, but uh...

1283
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:57,400
I love it when a plan comes together.

1284
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:07,100
They survived as soldiers of fortune.

1285
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:10,400
If you have a problem.

1286
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,200
If no one else can help.

1287
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:17,500
And if you can find
them, maybe you can hire.

1288
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:22,900
The A-Team.

1289
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:43,000
