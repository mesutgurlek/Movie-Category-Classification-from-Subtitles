00:31:39,812 --> 00:31:41,723
ROGER: We busted him,
we can talk to him.

628
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:44,042
WALTERS: Captain.
MURPHY: Riggs. Murtaugh.

629
00:31:44,132 --> 00:31:46,202
MURPHY: Get your asses back here.

630
00:31:49,172 --> 00:31:50,844
You'll be needing these.

631
00:31:51,572 --> 00:31:53,483
I'm reinstating both of you.

632
00:31:53,972 --> 00:31:56,440
ROGER: Don't you just love him?
RIGGS: Yeah.

633
00:31:56,532 --> 00:31:57,647
ROGER: God!

634
00:31:59,572 --> 00:32:01,085
You really are a beautiful man.

635
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:02,764
Just get rid of the blues.

636
00:32:02,852 --> 00:32:06,322
MURPHY: They don't go with your ponytail.
RIGGS: Absolutely not.

637
00:32:07,212 --> 00:32:08,361
RIGGS: Yeah, right.

638
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:09,487
Get a haircut!

639
00:32:09,572 --> 00:32:10,687
Of course, I won't.

640
00:32:10,772 --> 00:32:12,842
WALTERS: You've exceeded your authority,
Captain.

641
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:15,526
MURPHY: That's not how I see it.
WALTERS: That's how the chief will see it.

642
00:32:15,612 --> 00:32:17,489
- Take it up with him.
- I think I will.

643
00:32:17,572 --> 00:32:21,167
Catch up with them. We don't want this
screwed up with cowboy tactics.

644
00:32:21,252 --> 00:32:22,446
Son of a bitch.

645
00:32:24,772 --> 00:32:25,807
Hi, Billy.

646
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:29,727
Jack!

647
00:32:29,812 --> 00:32:30,927
Bye, Billy.

648

[Multiple silenced gunshots]

649
00:32:38,212 --> 00:32:39,725
See you, Billy.

650
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:48,089
OFFICER: Sergeant,
did you get what you need?

651
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:50,686
Not really. It's a dead issue, I'm afraid.

652
00:32:52,252 --> 00:32:54,288
RIGGS: How long has Phelps
been doing this?

653
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,091
LORNA: Doing what?
RIGGS: This armored-car thing.

654
00:32:57,252 --> 00:33:00,164
I wouldn't know.
I'm not interested in armored cars.

655
00:33:12,972 --> 00:33:15,247
I don't think she's telling us everything.

656
00:33:15,332 --> 00:33:16,560
I think you're right.

657
00:33:16,652 --> 00:33:19,212
Boy, these six days are going to be rough.

658
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:21,010
ROGER: God, be good to me.

659
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:26,767
MURPHY: Shit, son of a bitch knew
there was a camera in the wall.

660
00:33:27,532 --> 00:33:28,169
Damn it!

661
00:33:28,252 --> 00:33:30,812
He didn't know there was one
in the interrogation room.

662
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:32,291
ROGER: There isn't.

663
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:34,363
LORNA: We installed them six months ago.

664
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:36,522
LORNA: Every station.
MURPHY: That's great.

665
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:38,967
Six months and we don't know about it?

666
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:40,644
This is the "police police," Captain.

667
00:33:40,732 --> 00:33:44,088
"Police police." Very good. Can you say
that three times in a row, real fast?

668
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:46,481
RIGGS: Why? Am I getting to you?
LORNA: Are you trying to bait me?

669
00:33:46,572 --> 00:33:47,925
I'm a master at it.

670
00:33:48,012 --> 00:33:49,206
That figures.

671
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:51,886
Baiting master. Great, man,
try all the tricks.

672
00:33:51,972 --> 00:33:53,610
Freeze that. Stop it.

673
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:55,211
MURPHY: Jack Travis.

674
00:33:55,292 --> 00:33:56,202
BOTH: Who?

675
00:33:56,292 --> 00:33:58,522
Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.

676
00:33:58,972 --> 00:34:00,087
He was one of us.

677
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:03,642
MURPHY: Hell of a brutal cop.
He could beat a confession out of anyone.

678
00:34:03,732 --> 00:34:04,608
A dirty cop.

679
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:06,683
LORNA: I've never seen
so many suspensions...

680
00:34:06,772 --> 00:34:08,763
<i>... and reprimands and charges</i>
<i>of misconduct.</i>

681
00:34:08,852 --> 00:34:11,082
He's also as tough as they come.

682
00:34:11,612 --> 00:34:12,840
What happened to him?

683
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:14,047
I don't know.

684
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:17,727
His partner and him were on a stakeout.
He went for coffee, never came back.

685
00:34:17,812 --> 00:34:20,280
Looks like he's had
one cappuccino too many.

686
00:34:20,452 --> 00:34:22,170
We'd better brief Walters.

687
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:24,602
LORNA: Excuse me, cute stuff.

688
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:27,923
RIGGS: That's harassment.
ROGER: Cute stuff. That's you.

689
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:31,368
RIGGS: Captain.
LORNA: Boys, boys. Just the captain.

690
00:34:31,492 --> 00:34:34,848
Your involvement in this case ended
when Phelps hit the floor.

691
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:37,731
Why don't you just go back
and beat your street?

692
00:34:38,212 --> 00:34:41,010
LEO: Now's the time to buy.
MURPHY: Not now.

693
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:43,163
- Hey, Roger, Roger!
- Not now, Leo!

694
00:34:43,252 --> 00:34:45,812
- Not now!
- We got to talk, babe, okay?

695
00:34:45,892 --> 00:34:47,723
You're in trouble. You've got termites.

696
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:49,006
Termites?

697
00:34:49,332 --> 00:34:51,368
- Oh, God!
- You're infested!

698
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,770
The only thing holding up your house
is the paint.

699
00:34:53,852 --> 00:34:54,921
We should go.

700
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:57,162
Leo, could you get the place fumigated?

701
00:34:57,252 --> 00:34:59,561
We should pull every file on this guy.

702
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:01,961
I know this guy.
Are you watching <i>Geraldo</i>?

703

RIGGS: What?
LEO: I know the guy.

704

RIGGS: How do you know him?
LEO: I've seen the guy before.

ROGER: Where?
LEO: I don't know. I recognize him...

706
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:10,886
His name is Jack Travis.
Does that ring a bell?

707
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:13,689
Hands off the clothes. Okay?

708
00:35:14,052 --> 00:35:15,883
I'm thinking. Let me think.

709
00:35:16,612 --> 00:35:18,125
It was a big party.

710
00:35:18,212 --> 00:35:21,329
Someone brought a monkey
that knocked over the salad bar.

711
00:35:21,492 --> 00:35:24,609
And this guy comes in
and introduces me to another guy...

712
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,524
...who wants a favor.

713
00:35:27,012 --> 00:35:28,684
- I got it! I got it!
- What?

714
00:35:28,892 --> 00:35:29,927
He's got it!

715
00:35:30,052 --> 00:35:31,770
- I remember!
- You remember!

716
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:34,726
Don't do it. Don't let the earring fool you.

717
00:35:35,252 --> 00:35:37,447
- We're back. We're back!
- Yeah. Yeah.

wanted me to do favors for them!

724
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:58,967

another guy wanted Cuban cigars.

Probably by the glass.

mean anything to you?

it'd be like old times.

You had a tip on Travis.
You should have shared it with me.

944

No, I take that back.

945

You were required to share it with me.

LORNA: But it never got there.

982
00:50:19,292 --> 00:50:22,204
Instead, it found its way
into the hands of a 15-year-old boy...

983
00:50:22,292 --> 00:50:24,601
...who fired it on a police officer,
your partner.

984

I thought it looked familiar.

985
00:50:25,932 --> 00:50:27,888
LORNA:
That gun and 15,000 others like it...

986
00:50:27,972 --> 00:50:31,521
...were stolen from a police storage facility

...getting these weapons out of circulation
and now they're headed back out.

990
00:50:42,452 --> 00:50:46,968
By busting Phelps, you stumbled onto
something the LAPD's tried to keep quiet.

991
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:50,568
That's why Internal Affairs is onto this.
They think this is an inside job.

992
00:50:50,652 --> 00:50:53,246
LORNA: That's right.
They knew police procedures.

993
00:50:53,332 --> 00:50:55,527
They knew where the guns were stored
and how to get in.

994
00:50:55,612 --> 00:50:58,001
They even knew the sorting codes
on the containers...

995
00:50:58,092 --> 00:51:00,731
...because they took the automatics
and left the junk behind.

996
00:51:00,812 --> 00:51:03,485
LORNA: It all pointed to a cop.
RIGGS: Or an ex-cop.

997
00:51:03,572 --> 00:51:04,402
Right.

Close, Riggs?

1002
00:51:14,892 --> 00:51:17,690
Close is a lingerie shop
without a front window.

RIGGS: What is this place?

1008
00:51:33,692 --> 00:51:35,967
LORNA: I accessed Billy Phelps'
phone records on my computer.

1009
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:38,168
LORNA: He made a dozen calls
to this address.

1010
00:51:38,252 --> 00:51:40,368
RIGGS: That was nice of you
to steal that information.

LORNA: Semantics, Riggs.
RIGGS: "Semantics"?

LORNA: What?

Never mind. One, two, three.

01:48:09,532 --> 01:48:11,170
ROGER: You know something?
RIGGS: What?

2033
01:48:11,252 --> 01:48:14,767
When I do retire,
I hope your next partner is just like you.

2034
01:48:15,172 --> 01:48:18,881
There's winners and there's losers,
and God wouldn't do that to me.

2035
01:48:19,052 --> 01:48:20,451
He did it to me.

2036
01:48:21,052 --> 01:48:22,007
I know.

2037
01:48:23,372 --> 01:48:24,691
See what I mean?

2038
01:48:26,612 --> 01:48:27,965
My point, exactly.

2039
01:48:28,052 --> 01:48:29,451
Son of a bitch!

2040
01:48:32,852 --> 01:48:34,365
ROGER: <i>Stay away from my daughter!</i>

2041
01:48:34,452 --> 01:48:36,841
RIGGS: <i>You can't be serious?</i>
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

2042
01:48:36,932 --> 01:48:38,411
ROGER: <i>I saw you kiss Rianne.</i>

2043
01:48:38,492 --> 01:48:40,448
RIGGS: <i>She kissed me.</i>
<i>She finds me irresistible.</i>

2044
01:48:40,532 --> 01:48:41,726
ROGER: <i>That's not the point!</i>

2045
01:48:41,812 --> 01:48:43,689
RIGGS: <i>It was a platonic peck</i>
<i>on the cheek.</i>

2046
01:48:43,772 --> 01:48:46,206
ROGER: <i>If it's just friendship,</i>
<i>try shaking hands next time.</i>

2047
01:48:46,292 --> 01:48:47,725
RIGGS: <i>Are you getting enough fiber</i>
<i>in your diet?</i>

2048
01:48:47,812 --> 01:48:49,245
ROGER: <i>I'm getting enough fiber!</i>

2049
01:48:49,332 --> 01:48:51,163
RIGGS: <i>I'm spoken for, okay?</i>

2050
01:48:51,252 --> 01:48:53,971
RIGGS: <i>I'm gonna pick Lorna up</i>
<i>from the hospital this afternoon.</i>

2051
01:48:54,052 --> 01:48:55,371
RIGGS: <i>We're practically...</i>

2052
01:48:55,452 --> 01:48:57,886
ROGER: <i>You're serious?</i>
RIGGS: <i>We've got a dog and everything.</i>

2053
01:48:57,972 --> 01:49:00,532
RIGGS: <i>I figure I can make ends meet.</i>

2054
01:49:09,012 --> 01:49:11,970

01:49:12,052 --> 01:49:14,566
ROGER: <i>Don't even think about it.</i>
<i>Don't even try.</i>

2056
01:49:14,652 --> 01:49:17,724
RIGGS: <i>This is us, rolling to Code 2, High,</i>
<i>at Verrina Place.</i>

2057
01:49:17,812 --> 01:49:20,610
ROGER: <i>Shit. This time we wait</i>
<i>for the bomb squad.</i>

2058
01:49:20,692 --> 01:49:23,684
RIGGS: <i>Do you think I want to end up</i>
<i>in uniform again?</i>
