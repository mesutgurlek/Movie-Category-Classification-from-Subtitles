The fifth bronze head did exceptionally well.
It was a surprise to us.

66
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,120
Recent buyers, this auction season,
were all businessmen,

who just love their country.

68

That's because they'll do anything
for their own relics, won't they?

<i>And 6 for the Pig.</i>

there's a massive bonus in it for him.

84
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,749
As long as the money is right,
JC will get you anything.

85

Well, then, you tell him it's €1 million each.

86

And if he gets us the dragon <i>as</i> well,
I'll add another zero.

<i>National Geographic</i> is <i>very well-respected.</i>

Especially from credible and respected
media sources such as yours.

94

You are the expert.

We want to learn from you.

97
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,541
The Pyramids of Egypt,

98
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,084
the Parthenon in Greece,

99
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,750
and Cambodia's Angkor Wat,

100
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,957
are just like China's Old Summer Palace.

101
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,752
<i>The building of the Old Summer Palace
began in 1709.</i>

102
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,258
<i>It took over 150 years.</i>

103
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,765
<i>They say its magnificence stunned the world.</i>

104
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,760
<i>Envoys called it "The Garden of Gardens".</i>

105
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,309
<i>Haiyan Hall was its largest Western mansion.</i>

106
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,145
<i>This is where
the 12 Chinese zodiac statues stood,</i>

107
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,061
<i>each majestically spouting water at noon.</i>

108
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,571
<i>In July, 1860,</i>

109

<i>foreign armies breached Fort Dagu,</i>

<i>and shattered the Empire's feeble defences.</i>

<i>On October 6th,</i>

<i>the invaders stormed

<i>Many imperial treasures,
including the 12 bronze zodiac statues,</i>

114
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,255
<i>were ruthlessly pillaged, or burned.</i>

115
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,003
<i>The fire lasted three nights and days.</i>

116
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:48,256
<i>This 150 year old architectural masterpiece
was razed to the ground.</i>

117
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,931
Everybody!

118
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,350
One, two, three!

119
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,766
These students come from all over.

120
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,896
They've been working here for years.

121
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,195
Repatriating relics to their own countries.

122
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,322
We need everyone to work hard.

123
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,909
It takes centuries to create a miracle.

124
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,830
<i>But a bomb or fire
can destroy it in an instant.</i>

125
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,824
After much detailed research,

126
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,082
we came up with almost
exact replicas of the statues.

127
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,253
And you are the first reporter to see them.

128
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,756
- No pictures!
- Oh.

129
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,382
Sorry.

130
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,798
Five have been auctioned. And the rest?

131
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,304
There are many rumours
of their whereabouts.

132
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:39,689
One of my students in Paris
is an expert on ancient antiquities.

133
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,318
She recently examined
two of the auctioned heads.

134
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,894
Which two?

135
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,155
Rabbit head and the Rat head.

136
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,276
How can I contact her?

137
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,990
I'll contact her for you now.

138
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,117
Thanks.

139
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,992
- Can I touch?
- Of course.

140
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,076
Thank you.

141
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,383
Oh. Don't worry about doing that.

142
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,836
But I should.

143
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,971
It's here!

144
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,563
The Rat head is finished. Is it very valuable?

145
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,391
Depends on what you think is valuable.

146

We will voice our concerns peacefully.

155
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,892
JC: Guan's student lives here?

156
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,220

157
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,347
JC: Wait here.

00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,146
Ooh! Paris!

Are you Shangguan Ma-ding?

160
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,230
Ah! Yes.

161
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,781
But my research says

162
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,109
that Shangguan Ma-ding

Coco.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,797
Coco.

492
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,387
These things happened so long ago.

493
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,435
Back then, if a woman wore too little clothes,

494
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,726
someone might throw a stone at you.

495
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,307
No, her.

496
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:20,688
Sorry.

497
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,231
(IN MAN DARIN) Sorry for what?

498
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,607
Don't be a bleeding heart.

499
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,405
She should be the one apologising.

500
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:26,648
What did she say?

501
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,651
Did she say something?

502

(IN MANDARIN) I don't need you to translate.

503

504

They came to our country a century ago,
burnt, raped, murdered and pillaged.

505
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,629
(IN FRENCH) It's you who should apologise.

506
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:46,552
Over a century ago, your ancestors came
to our country to rape, pillage and murder.

507
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:50,965
Even 100 years later,
these memories still hurt the Chinese.

508
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,518
(IN FRENCH) It's true.

509
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,769

510

512
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,488
these things did indeed happen.

513
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,782
Sorry.

514
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,320
But at the end of the day,
all of these now belong to the bank.

515
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,495
This is worthless to me.

516

524

- Your one great grandfather's ship?
- Yes?

525
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,973
Did it sink, or was it grounded?

526
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,516
Who knows?

527
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,232

We're getting very interested

528

one great grandfather back.

529
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,070
If we stay another couple of days,

530

we might be able to help.

Thank you! Thank you so much!
It's wonderful.

Come on.

No stealing.

Who <i>says</i> we can't?

544

They stole it from us first.

545
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:18,893
If we take it, we're retrieving it, not stealing.

546

A good point!

547

could fetch a fortune?

No, no. This ring.
It's my family's crest. I found it here.

715
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:45,251
On our way here,
we come across graves and a few skeletons.

716
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,913
The ones outside must belong
to the ship's crew.

717
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,467
But judging from the decomposition
of those inside,

718
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,380
they're different from the others.

719

Some of them were stabbed as well.

720
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,307
They must have fought before they died.

721
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,434
Probably men who came
with her great grandfather.

722
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,103
They didn't die from natural causes.

723
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:07,265
I think they killed each other.

724
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,438
They killed each other?

725
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:13,488
So his son came back to look
for the spoils of war his father left behind?

- Yeah !
- Pee-pee.

733
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:28,620
Hey, it goes downhill.

734
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:33,042
And the path is lined with logs.
No wonder they cut so many trees.

Hey, look up there!

737
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:39,464
That's a huge anchor!

738
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,724
SIMON: Weird. Why's it hung up there?

739
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,349
It's a clever lever device.

740
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,059
As the anchor descends,
the chain rod will ascend,

741
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:54,237
and it sends the trunk downhill
via the pulley.

742
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:58,112
No wonder I couldn't find
a single pulley on the ship.

743
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:02,411
This is how we benefit
from our ancestors' wisdom!

744

You don't seem excited.

I'm thinking about
how to take this trunk back with us.

If it's really filled with...

747
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,087
It's not an "if".

You came for the gold and the bronze heads!

997
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,027
You could say that.

998
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:59,367
Whenever you recover a bronze head,
you end up auctioning it.

- What do you plan to do with these two?

They will be picked up at the port.

Why can't we profit a little from them?

What about national dignity?

1006
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,886
These battered heads
have nothing to do with dignity.

of our cultural heritage!

1134
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:24,349
What?

1135
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:28,274
<i>COCO". My brother, Lily and Michelle.</i>

1136
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,522
Before my father passed away,

1137
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,731
he asked me to always look after him.

1138
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,325
He's my only family now.

1139
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,825
He is our family's future.

1140
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:47,536
We're all passionate about each making
our own contributions to our countries.

1141
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:52,089
But now, two of us are lying in hospital beds,
and three of us are missing.

1142
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,751
And we don't even know
if they are alive or dead.

1143
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:55,835
I beg you.

1144
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:57,962
Did you call the police?

1145
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:00,966
I've tried everything.

1146
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:03,642
There's nothing else to do.
You're my last resort.

1147
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:07,055
Of course if I can help you, I will.

1148
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,231
But these people...

1149
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:11,985
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

1150
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,483
And because Professor Guan
gave me the data,

1151
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:20,989
he's been detained by the police.

1152
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,713
Why are you crying?

1153
01:11:55,061 --> 01:12:02,070
Mom and Dad, do you really have to do this?

1154
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:08,541
Coco said her brother disappeared

1155
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:11,165
while spying on the MP
after the Dragon head auction.

1156
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:12,712
MP must have something to do with this.

1157
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,373
There are trees, nothing else.
Where's the proof'?

1158
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,458
Find it! Aren't you a compassionate person?

1159
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:19,590
I feel more for you. Is this what you want?

1160
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:23,389
- We can't even tolerate each other.
- What, tolerate each other?

1161
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:25,432
Do you stink?
Does he embarrass you in public?

1162
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,226
Don't just give up until you've really tried.

1163
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:31,022
Stop patronising me and go and save them,
or it will be too late!

1164
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:33,816
Promising to help them is easy. But how?

1165
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,610
You're the one who said
you mustn't give up until you've tried!

1166
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:38,654
- Hey, JC!
- Hey! Jonathan!

1167
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:39,772
<i>What's up?</i>

1168
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:42,530
You won't believe it.
I just found the <i>Roses</i> painting.

1169
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,531
<i>Great, I'll come right over!</i>

1170
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,987
See, that's the way!

1171
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,367
BONNIE: Speak!

1172
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:49,574
I didn't lie about MP's address.
Why would I lie about it?

1173
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:50,909
JC: I believe you.

1174
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:55,418
But you knew that MP had the Dragon head.
And we'll never get the bonus, would we?

1175
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:58,424
How would I know'?
We're old partners. Why would I lie to you?

1176
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:02,129
- You never lied to me?
- No way! Why would I lie to you?

1177
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,051
What are you doing?

1178
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:07,885
JC: This is the world's most powerful acid.
I made it just for you.

1179
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,311
BONNIE: And don't move!
JC: Have you lied to me?

1180
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:14,140
Yes. I lied to you from day one.
From day one!

1181
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:21,363
I told the truth, so why'd you do that?

1182
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,160
(CHUCKLING) Fruity salts.

1183
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:27,577
Genius!

1184
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:31,749
JC: Did you find Simon and David?
BONNIE: Probably on a date.

1185
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:37,919
You came all the way out here to see me,
or is this visit just to cut out the middleman?

1186
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:41,752
JC: They are blood-suckers.
Jonathan lied about the Dragon head.

1187
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:46,469
Can't really blame him.
We've had the Dragon head for ages.

1188
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,094
Even I forgot about it.

1189
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,141
Never mind.

1190
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:52,516
In our business, we all cheat each other.
I'm used to it.

1191
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,306
Where's the <i>Roses?</i>

1192
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:07,030
We wouldn't have brought it here
if it was a fake.

1193
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,361
I still have to examine it.

1194
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,038
- But it can't leave our sight.
- Fine.

1195
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:17,162
Just go ahead.

1196
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:18,959
Check this out for me.

1197
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:22,967
I can't clone one so quickly.

1198
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,054
Verify this, please.

1199
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,472
Wait here.

1200
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,474
Can we look around, too?

1201
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:31,968
MICHAEL: Be my guest.

1202
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,600
BONNIE: Who'd have thought they could hide
a huge lab under a vineyard?

1203
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,681
JC: Actually, it's a hub for counterfeiting.

1204
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:39,608
They make billions every year.
They control everything.

1205
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:42,316
Hey! What are those guys doing there?

1206
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:46,741
They're sandblasting a porcelain vase,
which will then be chemically treated.

1207
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:50,286
After that,
it will end up looking like an old antique.

1208
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:53,660
Chinese Xuan paper is layered
and can be separated.

1209
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,993
This is an original.
Peel it apart, get two originals.

1210
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,329
- Can't you make five or six?
- They'd be too thin.

1211
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:02,165
- What about that?
- That one's silk, no layers.

1212
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:05,297
So they slice it up into eight parts for sale.

1213
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,382
BONNIE: I'm impressed they thought of it.

1214
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:12,008
See? The pieces of old relics
can be perfectly restored.

1215
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,889
They just combine the parts with replicas.

1216
01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:16,433
BONNIE: So it's partly real, partly fake?

1217
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:21,313
After exposure to X-ray, a brand new vase
can gain 1,000 years of history.

1218
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,983
They're very resourceful.
How much on the market is real?

1219
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,735
90% are fakes now.

1220
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:28,691
I pity those rich people.

1221
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,276
Hey. This way.

1222
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,700
BONNIE: Wow. What is this?

1223
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:37,033
JC: This is a special furnace
to emulate carbon emissions.

1224
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:39,539
Designed to fool antique experts.

1225
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:41,750
But is not perfect yet.

1226
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:45,584
So the fuel and the catalyst
still have to be added by hand.

1227
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,011
I can't believe they'd try this.

1228
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:51,635
Well, it looks very crude. Is it dangerous?

1229
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:55,472
JC: Anything involving deception
is dangerous.

1230
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,145
(LAUGHS) Hey! Nice to see you, JC!

1231
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:05,270
Did you lose your tongue?

1232
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:08,697
- I don't want to see you.
- Come on, man.

1233
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:11,492
- Who's this guy?
- This is JC.

1234
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,657
A big name in the business.

1235
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:15,742
Reputations can be deceiving.

1236
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,282
Competitor?

1237
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:21,164
We are not the same.
We will never do what he does.

1238
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,790
Hey, don't be so cocksure, all right?

1239
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,423
Whatever you do, I can do better.

1240
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:34,011
Vulture, you stole a Buddha
from a Southeast Asian temple.

1241
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,934
That's right. And those people still think

1242
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:39,603
that it was the work
of a neighbouring country.

1243
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:43,266
It sparked a border war,
killing thousands of people.

1244
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:44,851
People die.

1245
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,143
That's their business.

1246
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:49,196
You're the scumbag of our business.

1247
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:53,450
You know, the last person who called me that
is no longer breathing.

1248
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:54,743
Oh, yeah?

1249
01:16:56,695 --> 01:17:01,371
S-C-U-M-B-A-G.

1250
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:03,752
Scumbag.

1251
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:07,252
I can kick your ass
without leaving this couch.

1252
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:13,261
Show me.

1253
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,362
You lose!

1254
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:36,235
Still touching.

1255
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:47,139
Hey!

1256
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:50,980
(LAUGHING)

1257
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:53,820
(LAUGHING)

1258
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,148
Touching.

1259
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:58,533
Stop!

1260
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,781
You can all go now. Have a good vacation.

1261
01:19:02,863 --> 01:19:03,864
Good night!

1262
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,497
MICHAEL: What are you guys doing?

1263
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:13,708
Just checking the furniture.

1264
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,344
Cheap imitation.

1265
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:20,886
Hey, boys, take it outside. Not here. Okay?

1266
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:23,509
-It's real.
- The <i>Roses!</i>

1267
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:25,432
Eleven o'clock.

1268
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:28,185
MICHAEL: Leave them here when you're done.
We'll clear them later, okay?

1269
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:32,522
You'll be paid tomorrow. As usual.

1270
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,028
Your price is very high.
I think we should wait for Dad.

1271
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,736
I can give you a discount.

1272
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,195
But I want three people.

1273
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:40,742
What?

1274
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:44,038
The students you have up there.

1275
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:48,125
I don't quite understand.

1276
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:50,123
Let me show you.

1277
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:55,465
That confirms I'm right.

1278
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,219
Fine, then. Prove it if you can.

1279
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:01,971
JC: Hey.

1280
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,681
I will then.

1281
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,142
(m FRENCH) Stop him!

1282
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:12,771
GUARD: I said stop!

1283
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:13,851
Don't move!

1284
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,697
Don't let him get away!

1285
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:20,573
Stop!

1286
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:24,862
Stop him!

1287
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:46,217
There he is, let's go!

1288
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,307

(IN MANDARIN) HOW is JC?

1444
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:54,345
He's awake. You can go and see him.

1445
01:38:54,429 --> 01:38:55,772
I'll go to see him now.

1446
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:56,973
Okay-

Mama!

1450

SIMON: Only the efforts
of two half-decent people

1451
01:39:13,739 --> 01:39:16,242
can give her a decent environment
to grow up in.

If you're willing, we can start this over.

Hey! It's a girl! Come and see! Come and see!

WU: Congratulations! What's her name?

1456
01:39:34,385 --> 01:39:36,638
- DAVID: Pax. It's Latin for "peace".
- Pax?

1457
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:38,394
JC gave me four names, and I...

1458
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:40,983
- Sister?
- Sister?

1459
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,188
- Who's she?
- She's the woman from the voice-mail.

1460
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:47,569
- Let's see.
- DAVID: I'll be right back.

1461
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:54,364
Come here. Come here. Here.

1462
01:39:54,739 --> 01:39:55,740
Who is she?

DOCTOR: He's going to be fine.
In fact, he is healing quickly.

1464
01:39:58,242 --> 01:40:00,836
Well, you should be able to check him out of
here within a week or two.

1465
01:40:00,912 --> 01:40:02,038
SISTER: Thank you.

1466
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,757
- I was just thinking...
-it's okay.

1467
01:40:09,212 --> 01:40:13,012
That was an old message.
Now that I know what you've been up to...

1468
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:14,262
Get up!

too close to the edge! It's dangerous!

1478
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,854
I just saw the volcano explode next to me.

1479
01:41:47,226 --> 01:41:49,775
Don't worry. Volcanoes are scared of me.

1481

NG, stupid!

1483
01:43:01,634 --> 01:43:02,635
Was it okay?

1484

We were not the same.
