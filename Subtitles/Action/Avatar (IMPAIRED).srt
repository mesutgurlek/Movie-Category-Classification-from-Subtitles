1
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,214
<I>Sooner or later though, ...

2
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:55,306
<I> ... you always have to wake up.

3
00:02:11,616 --> 00:02:14,301
<I>In Cryo you don't dream at all.

4
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:16,079
<I>It doesn't feel like 6 years.

5
00:02:16,313 --> 00:02:19,519
<I>More like a fifth of
tequila and ass-kicking.

6
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:28,307
<I>Tommy was the scientist, not me.

7
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:32,822
<I>He was the one who wanted to get shot
light-years out in space to find the answers.

8
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:34,591
Are we there yet?

9
00:02:34,627 --> 00:02:35,825
Yeah, we're there sunshine.

10
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:37,927
We're there.

11
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:41,148
<I>It's about your brother.

12
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:46,590
<I>So, a week before Tommy
was going to ship out...

13
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:49,151
<I>A guy with a gun ends his journey ...

14
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:51,598
<I>... for the paper in his wallet.

15
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:55,714
Being in Cryo for 5 years,
9 months and 22 days.

16
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:58,754
You will be hungry,
you will be weak.

17
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:01,401
If you feel nauseous please use the ...

18
00:03:01,435 --> 00:03:03,601
<I>Yeah, Tommy was the scientist.

19
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:08,317
<I>Me, I'm just another dumb grunt
going someplace he's going to regret.

20
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:23,446
<I>Up ahead was Pandora.

21
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:28,847
<I>You grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there.

22
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:41,615
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

23
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:44,653
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

24
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:47,253
And since your genome is identical to his,

25
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:49,854
you could step into his shoes.

26
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,658
So to speak.

27
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,381
<I>It'd be a fresh start,
on a new world.

28
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:11,344
And the pay is good.

29
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,065
Very good.

30
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,640
Exo-Packs on!
Let's go, Exo-Packs on!

31
00:04:37,675 --> 00:04:41,677
Remember people, you lose that mask
you're unconscious in 20 seconds.

32
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:44,879
You're dead in 4 minutes.
Let nobody be dead today.

33
00:04:44,913 --> 00:04:48,280
It looks very bad on my report.

34
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:51,090
This is TAD-1-6 on approach.

35
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,299
Crossing outer marker.
Monument in sight

36
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:33,379
<I>One life ends...

37
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,698
<I>Another begins.

38
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:46,201
Harnesses off. Get your packs ...
-- Put it together. Let's go.

39
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,057
One minute, let's go.

40
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:52,426
When the ramp comes down, go
directly into the base. Do not stop.

41
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:55,705
Go straight inside.
Wait for my mark!

42
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:03,629
Go! Go! Go! Go! ..

43
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,430
Get out of there!

44
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:05,916
Keep moving. Let's go!

45
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:13,079
<I>There's no such thing
as an ex-Marine.

46
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:14,275
<I>You may be out...

47
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:16,313
<I> ... but you never lose the attitude.

48
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:21,795
<I>I told myself I could pass
any test a man can pass.

49
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:28,286
<I>They can fix the spine,
if you got the money.

50
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:32,122
<I>But not on Vet benefits,
not in this economy.

51
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,204
Let's go Special K.
Do not make me wait for you!

52
00:06:36,243 --> 00:06:38,724
Well, well, ladies.

53
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:42,126
Look at all this fresh meat!

54
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:51,023
<I> Back on Earth, these guys
were Army dogs. Marines.

55
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:53,953
<I>Fighting for freedom.

56
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,067
<I>Look out hot rod.

57
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:06,684
<I>But out here they're just hired guns,
taking the money, working for the company.

58
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:11,340
Check this out man.
Meals on wheels.

59
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,839
Aww, man , that is just wrong.

60
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:30,892
You are not in Kansas anymore.

61
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,877
You are on Pandora,
ladies and gentlemen.

62
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:40,412
Respect that fact,
every second of every day.

63
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:44,513
If there is a hell,

64
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:49,887
you might want to go there for some
R and R after a tour on Pandora.

65
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:55,268
Out there beyond that fence,
every living thing that

66
00:07:55,307 --> 00:08:00,728
crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to
kill you and eat your eyes for Juju Beads

67
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:06,510
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

68
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,139
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

69
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,729
that will stop your heart in one minute.

70
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,064
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occurring carbon fibber.

71
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,248
They are very hard to kill.

72
00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:24,579
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

73
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:29,397
I will not succeed.

74
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,494
Not with all of you.

75
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:38,150
If you wish to survive you need to
cultivate a strong mental attitude.

76
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,362
You've got to obey the rules.

77
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,254
Pandora rules.

78
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:46,545
Rule number one...

79
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:50,918
It's nothing like an old school safety
brief to put your mind at ease.

80
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:56,623
Jake, you're Jake right?

81
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:59,048
Tom's brother.

82
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:01,405
You look just like him.

83
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,775
Sorry, I'm Norm Spellman.
I went through Avatar training with him.

84
00:09:05,809 --> 00:09:09,269
The Bio-Lab. We're going to
spend a lot of time here.

85
00:09:09,303 --> 00:09:13,249
How you doing,
Norm, Avatar driver.

86
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:15,528
Here's the link room right here.

87
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:19,305
This is where we're
connecting to the Avatar.

88
00:09:19,306 --> 00:09:24,646
Me and Norm are here to drive these
remotely controlled bodies called Avatars.

89
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:29,744
And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.

90
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,717
Hey, welcome.

91
00:09:31,752 --> 00:09:34,686
Welcome to Pandora,
good to have you.

92
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:40,187
Damn, they got big. - They fully
mature on the flight out.

93
00:09:40,222 --> 00:09:43,397
So the progress up the stem
seem to work really well.

94
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,370
Yeah, they got great muscle tone.

95
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:47,413
It'll take us a few hours
to get them prepared,

96
00:09:47,414 --> 00:09:49,420
but you can take them out tomorrow.

97
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,231
There's yours.

98
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:56,162
Doctor, Norm Spellman.
- Pleasure to meet you.

99
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:23,831
Looks like him.

100
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:26,848
Looks like you.

101
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:30,255
This is your Avatar now, Jake.

102
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:36,521
The concept is that every driver
is matched to his own Avatar.

103
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,413
So that their nervous system are in tune.

104
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:43,104
Or something...

105
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:48,968
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's Avatar.

106
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,128
Which is insanely expensive.

107
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:53,095
Is this right?

108
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:55,297
I just say whatever
to the video log?

109
00:10:55,332 --> 00:10:57,793
Yeah, we got to get the habit
of documenting everything.

110
00:10:57,827 --> 00:11:00,217
What we see, what we feel,
it's all part of the science.

111
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:03,335
And good science is good observation.
- Plus it'll help keep you sane

112
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,337
for the next 6 years.

113
00:11:06,372 --> 00:11:08,538
Whatever.

114
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:10,352
So uh, ...

115
00:11:11,742 --> 00:11:13,942
Here I am.

116
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:17,423
Doing science.

117
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:19,307
They're coming out.

118
00:11:19,343 --> 00:11:22,665
<I>Attention, drivers coming out of the lane.

119
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:30,543
Oh God ...

120
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:34,032
<I>- Where's the lab coat?
- Where's her lab coat?

121
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:37,654
Who's got my goddamn cigarette!?

122
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:41,278
Guys, what's wrong with this picture?

123
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:43,124
Thank you!

124
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,922
Grace Augustine is a legend.

125
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,725
She's the head of the Avatar
program. She wrote the book.

126
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,682
I mean literally wrote the
book on Pando ran botany.

127
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:53,445
That's because she likes
plants better than people.

128
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:55,331
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

129
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:59,768
Grace I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

130
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:04,568
Norm, I hear good things about
you. How's your Na'vi?

131
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:22,665
Grace, this is Jake Sully.

132
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,549
Yeah yeah, I know who you are
and I don't need you.

133
00:12:25,584 --> 00:12:28,190
I need your brother.
You know, the PHD

134
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:30,868
who trained for three
years for this mission...

135
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:33,073
He's dead.

136
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:35,468
I know it's a big
inconvenience for everyone.

137
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:38,390
How much lab training have you had?

138
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,591
I dissected a frog once.

139
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:42,956
You see?

140
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,797
They're just pissing on us with out
even a courtesy of calling it rain.

141
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:48,316
I'm going to Selfridge.
- No Grace!

142
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,879
No man, this is such bullshit!

143
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:52,481
I'm going to kick his corporate butt.

144
00:12:52,827 --> 00:12:55,921
He has no business sticking
his nose in my department.

145
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:58,529
Here tomorrow, 08:00.

146
00:12:58,564 --> 00:13:00,725
Try and use big words.

147
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:12,865
<I>Scorpion 2 Hotel, Hell's Gate Tower.
You are cleared for South departure. ...

148
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:22,382
Did you see that?
- Yes sir.

149
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:27,419
No you didn't, you were looking at
the monitor. I love this putter Ronnie.

150
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,987
Parker...

151
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:34,823
I used to think it
was benign neglect,

152
00:13:34,824 --> 00:13:37,624
but now I see that you're
intentionally screwing me.

153
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,627
Grace, I enjoy our little talks...

154
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:48,911
I need a researcher,
not some jar-head drop out.

155
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:50,831
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

156
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:52,397
Lucky?
- Yeah.

157
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:54,598
How is this in any way 'lucky'?

158
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:56,507
Lucky your guy had a twin brother.

159
00:13:56,913 --> 00:13:59,508
And lucky that brother
wasn't some oral hygienist or something.

160
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:03,320
A Marine we could use. I'm assigning him
to your team as security escort.

161
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:07,407
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there.

162
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:09,503
Look, you're supposed to be
winning the hearts and the

163
00:14:09,504 --> 00:14:11,564
minds of the natives, isn't that the
whole point of your little puppet show?

164
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:15,047
You look like them, you talk like
them and they'll start trusting us.

165
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:17,215
We build them a school,
we teach them English...

166
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:21,050
But after how many years relations with
the indigenous are only getting worse.

167
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:24,252
That tends to happen when you
use machine guns on them.

168
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:26,534
Right, come here.

169
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,422
This is why we're here, Unobtanium.

170
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,542
Because this little gray
rock sells for 20 million a kilo.

171
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:41,863
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

172
00:14:41,898 --> 00:14:45,143
It's what pays for
your science. Comprendo??

173
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:48,351
Now, those savages are
threatening our whole operation.

174
00:14:48,385 --> 00:14:50,787
We're on the brink of war and you're

175
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:53,189
supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

176
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,952
So use what you've got
and get me some results.

177
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:10,557
How much link-time have you logged?

178
00:15:10,596 --> 00:15:13,759
About 520 hours.
- That's good.

179
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,649
You're in there.
You're here.

180
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,285
How much have you logged?
- Zip.

181
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:22,046
But I read a manual.

182
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:24,407
Tell me you're joking.

183
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,088
This is cool.

184
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:29,090
Let's go.

185
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:35,094
Don't. I got this.

186
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,196
So you just figured you'd come out here

187
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:43,899
to the most hostile environment
known to man...

188
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:47,618
with no training of any kind
and see how it went?

189
00:15:47,652 --> 00:15:49,985
What was going through your head?

190
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:53,506
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

191
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:56,707
Biometrics are good.
- 1-3 is ready.

192
00:15:56,741 --> 00:15:58,989
Keep your arms in,
hands in.

193
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,710
Head down.

194
00:16:02,223 --> 00:16:03,122
Down.

195
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:06,030
Just relax and let your mind go blank.

196
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,591
That shouldn't be hard for you.

197
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:12,595
Kiss the darkest part of my...
- Initiate link.

198
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:16,517
Run sequence, Unit 3.
- Launching.

199
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,521
I have the first congruency.

200
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:35,009
That's a gorgeous brain.
Nice activity.

201
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:40,053
Go figure.
- Phase lock 40%.

202
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:45,652
I'm going in.

203
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,266
I'm going in in 4.

204
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:52,617
Phase lock 99%.
Link is stable.

205
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,448
Jake, can you hear me?

206
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:13,251
Can you hear me, Jake?

207
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:16,073
Pupillary reflex is good.

208
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,835
Hearing response normal.
How are you feeling Jake?

209
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,236
Hey guys.

210
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,754
Welcome to your
new body Jake.

211
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:27,216
<I> Good.

212
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:29,326
We're going to take this
nice and easy Jake.

213
00:17:29,404 --> 00:17:30,793
And touch your thumb to your fingers.

214
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:32,189
Thumb to your fingers.

215
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:34,800
No problem.
- Good. I can see you remember that one.

216
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:35,804
Got it.

217
00:17:35,828 --> 00:17:37,892
Well, if you want to
sit up, that's fine.

218
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:41,615
Let's take it nice and slow Jake.
No tranquil attacks here, that's good.

219
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:43,704
Do you feel lightheaded or dizzy?

220
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,624
Wiggling your toes.
- Good Jake.

221
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:50,838
System motor control is good.

222
00:17:50,878 --> 00:17:53,484
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

223
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,340
Take it easy, don't get
ahead of yourself, okay?

224
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:02,865
There are few more sensory and motor
reflex tests we need to run, so take it easy.

225
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:06,873
Sit down.
- Jake listen to me.

226
00:18:08,718 --> 00:18:12,084
Jake I need you to sit down.
- It's OK, I got this.

227
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:15,712
Jake you need to sit down.
- Guys get him back on the gurney now.

228
00:18:15,748 --> 00:18:19,300
You need to sit down.
you need time to adjust to atm..

229
00:18:22,106 --> 00:18:22,808
Yeah!

230
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:25,314
Sedate him!

231
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,761
1,000 mg of Secondly.

232
00:18:26,946 --> 00:18:27,973
Stop! ...
-- Stop!

233
00:18:28,422 --> 00:18:29,940
Woah ... Woah.

234
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:32,421
- Jake!
- Jake, listen to me.

235
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:34,936
You're not used to your
Avatar body, this is dangerous.

236
00:18:34,978 --> 00:18:38,144
This is great.
- Come on, they're going to put you out.

237
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:43,042
Sit down!

238
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:44,477
No no, ...
I got to get out of these leads.

239
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:46,014
God dammit!
Bring them!

240
00:18:50,893 --> 00:18:53,299
Come on, you isn’t got no skills.

241
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:57,308
I don't even have to
play defence. - Hey guys.

242
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:00,715
It's OK, I'll get him.
- Jake you have to come inside.

243
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:07,130
Sorry.

244
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:12,344
You're not supposed to be running!

245
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:23,968
Sorry.
- Watch it.

246
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:48,186
Hey Marine!

247
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,550
Damn...

248
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:52,599
Grace?

249
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:55,519
Who did you expect numb nuts?

250
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:58,212
Think fast!

251
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:01,133
Motor control is looking good.

252
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:12,939
C'mon everybody quiet down.

253
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:15,249
Lights out.

254
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:17,408
C'mon Louise, chop chop.

255
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:21,700
Don't play with that,
you'll go blind.

256
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:24,507
That's kind of freaky.
- C'mon.

257
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:25,510
Scat.

258
00:20:29,717 --> 00:20:33,326
Lights out, see you at dinner kitties.

259
00:20:56,176 --> 00:20:58,585
Welcome back.

260
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,526
You all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

261
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:12,896
I'm Trudy, I fly all the Scientzoids.

262
00:21:12,936 --> 00:21:15,542
And this here is my baby.

263
00:21:15,577 --> 00:21:17,707
Hold on a second.

264
00:21:17,747 --> 00:21:21,120
Hey Wainfleet, get it done.

265
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,843
We bounce at 09:00.
- I'm on it captain.

266
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:29,934
Mine-Strike's still loose.
- You guys are packing some heavy gear.

267
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,138
Watch it!

268
00:21:32,178 --> 00:21:34,784
That's cause we're not the only
thing flying around out there.

269
00:21:34,818 --> 00:21:36,557
Or the biggest.

270
00:21:36,592 --> 00:21:39,678
But I need you on a Door-Gun.
I'm a man short.

271
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:41,883
Thought you'd never ask.

272
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:46,412
There's your man.
See you on the flight lane.

273
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:59,085
You wanted to see me Colonel?

274
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:02,209
This low gravity
will make you soft.

275
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:05,536
You get soft...

276
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,828
Pandora will shit you out
dead with zero warning.

277
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:15,019
I pulled your record Corporal.

278
00:22:15,053 --> 00:22:18,167
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

279
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:22,054
Nothing like this here though.

280
00:22:23,696 --> 00:22:26,949
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighbourhood.

281
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:31,716
Figured it's just another hell hole.
- I was the first Recon myself.

282
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:35,803
Few years ahead of you,
well maybe more than a few.

283
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,011
Three tours in Nigeria,
not a scratch.

284
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:41,097
I come out here...

285
00:22:41,137 --> 00:22:44,942
Day one. Think I felt
like a shave tail Louie?

286
00:22:45,827 --> 00:22:49,513
They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

287
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:52,119
Make me pretty again.

288
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,129
But you know what,
I kind of like it.

289
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:58,137
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

290
00:22:59,781 --> 00:23:02,344
The Avatar program is a bad joke.

291
00:23:02,384 --> 00:23:06,133
Bunch a limp dick
science majors.

292
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:10,491
However, it does present
an opportunity

293
00:23:10,526 --> 00:23:14,813
most timely and unique.
Clear!

294
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:23,076
A Recon GI-re in an Avatar body.

295
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:26,683
That's a potent mix,
Gives me the Goosebumps.

296
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:32,134
Such a Marine could provide the
Intel I need, right on the ground.

297
00:23:33,055 --> 00:23:35,826
Right in the hostile's camp.

298
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:41,153
Look Sully, I want you to learn
these savages from the inside.

299
00:23:41,188 --> 00:23:43,122
I want you to gain their trust.

300
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:44,882
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

301
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:46,559
or hammer them hard if they won't.

302
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:51,377
Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.

303
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:53,900
You walk like one of her science pukes. ...

304
00:23:53,936 --> 00:23:56,067
You quack like one...

305
00:23:56,788 --> 00:23:59,634
But you report to me.

306
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,478
Can you do that for me son?

307
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:05,286
Hell yeah sir.

308
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:08,092
Well all right then.

309
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:21,129
Son, I take care of my own.

310
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:23,650
You get me what I need,
I'll see to it you get

311
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:26,134
your legs back when you rotate home.

312
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:29,261
Your real legs.

313
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:33,351
That sounds real good sir.

314
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:41,770
Link's ready.

315
00:24:42,893 --> 00:24:46,983
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

316
00:24:50,011 --> 00:24:50,741
<I> Link 3 ready.

317
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:54,722
All right, I'm going in.

318
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,765
Shut it down, we're going to stay a while.

319
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:12,095
Norm, your pack.

320
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,588
Stay with the ship.

321
00:26:17,627 --> 00:26:20,515
One idiot with a gun is enough.

322
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,524
You the man, Doc.

323
00:27:00,407 --> 00:27:04,495
Prolemurs, they're not aggressive.

324
00:27:06,106 --> 00:27:10,630
Relax Marine, you're making me nervous.

325
00:27:15,314 --> 00:27:20,361
So, how will they know we're here?
- I'm sure they're watching us right now.

326
00:27:23,164 --> 00:27:26,126
Keep moving Norm.
- Keep up guys.

327
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,131
And here I go.
- Scanning.

328
00:27:35,338 --> 00:27:37,577
It's that fast?

329
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,746
Amazing isn't it?
- Yeah

330
00:27:40,781 --> 00:27:43,503
That is signal transduction

331
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:46,270
from this route to the route
of the tree next to it.

332
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:48,711
So, we should take a sample.

333
00:27:48,711 --> 00:27:50,352
Okay, ... Sample.

334
00:27:52,274 --> 00:27:56,558
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

335
00:27:57,081 --> 00:28:01,083
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

336
00:28:01,485 --> 00:28:02,286
Oh, right.

337
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,548
Don't shoot.

338
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,370
Don't shoot. You'll piss him off.

339
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:08,119
It's already pissed off.

340
00:29:08,154 --> 00:29:11,557
Jake, that armour is
too thick, trust me.

341
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:21,570
It's a territorial threat display,
do not run or he'll charge.

342
00:29:21,605 --> 00:29:23,691
So what do I do?
Dance with it?

343
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:27,574
Just, hold your ground.

344
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,651
C'mon, what you got?!

345
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:47,316
Oh yeah. Who's bad?
That's right.

346
00:29:48,515 --> 00:29:51,323
That's what I'm talking about bitch.

347
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:55,692
That's right, get your
punk ass back to mommy.

348
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:59,890
You got nothing, keep running.
Why don't you bring back some friends.

349
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:19,749
What about this one?
Run, don't run, what?!

350
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:23,833
Run, definitely run!

351
00:34:09,477 --> 00:34:14,002
We're going to have to call it guys,
we're not allowed to run Night Ops. Col's orders.

352
00:34:15,482 --> 00:34:18,565
Sorry doc, he's just going to
have to hang on till morning.

353
00:34:18,605 --> 00:34:21,610
He won't make it till morning.

354
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:15,892
I don't have all goddamn night.

355
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:18,736
Come on!

356
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:34,696
Wait, don't!

357
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:39,100
Great.

358
00:38:35,758 --> 00:38:39,483
I know you probably
don't understand this.

359
00:38:40,043 --> 00:38:42,166
But...

360
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:48,056
Thank you.

361
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:54,059
Thank you.

362
00:38:57,182 --> 00:39:00,066
That was pretty impressive.

363
00:39:01,587 --> 00:39:04,912
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along.

364
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:10,998
Wait a second,
where are you going?

365
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,101
Wait up.

366
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:15,964
Slow down.

367
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:19,284
I just wanted to say thanks
for killing those things...

368
00:39:21,686 --> 00:39:24,093
Don't thank.

369
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:27,294
You don't thank for this.

370
00:39:27,335 --> 00:39:30,239
This is sad.

371
00:39:30,274 --> 00:39:32,846
Very sad, only.

372
00:39:32,881 --> 00:39:35,424
OK, I'm sorry.

373
00:39:35,944 --> 00:39:38,827
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

374
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:45,119
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

375
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:47,316
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

376
00:39:47,356 --> 00:39:49,144
Your fault!
- Aye, wooo.

377
00:39:49,522 --> 00:39:50,750
Your fault.
-- Easy.

378
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:56,645
You're like a baby, making noise,
don't know what to do.

379
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:00,494
Fine

380
00:40:03,456 --> 00:40:06,138
If you love your
little forest friends...

381
00:40:07,177 --> 00:40:09,981
Why not let them just kill my ass?

382
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:12,427
What's the thinking?

383
00:40:12,462 --> 00:40:15,748
Why save you?
- Why save me?

384
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,392
You have a strong heart.

385
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:25,997
No fear.

386
00:40:29,282 --> 00:40:33,364
But stupid, ignorant like a child.

387
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:41,776
Well if I'm like a child, then ..

388
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:44,264
... maybe you should teach me.

389
00:40:44,298 --> 00:40:48,421
Sky people cannot learn. You do not see.
- Teach me how to see.

390
00:40:48,457 --> 00:40:51,386
No one can teach you to see.

391
00:40:52,425 --> 00:40:55,390
Come on, can't we talk?

392
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,932
Where did you learn to speak English?

393
00:40:57,965 --> 00:41:00,433
Dr. Augustine's school?

394
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,401
You're like a baby.

395
00:41:12,205 --> 00:41:15,009
I need your help.

396
00:41:15,044 --> 00:41:17,814
You should not be here.

397
00:41:17,854 --> 00:41:21,417
OK, take me with you.
- No, go back.

398
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:25,062
No.

399
00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:27,821
Go back.

400
00:42:16,513 --> 00:42:18,596
What are they?

401
00:42:19,397 --> 00:42:22,119
Seeds of the sacred tree.

402
00:42:22,155 --> 00:42:25,723
Very pure spirits.

403
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:50,431
What was that all about?

404
00:42:52,035 --> 00:42:54,034
Come.

405
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,323
Where are we going?

406
00:43:09,851 --> 00:43:11,376
Come.

407
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:17,541
What's your name?

408
00:44:17,603 --> 00:44:19,606
What's going on?

409
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:26,936
What's happening?

410
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,731
What's he saying?

411
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:14,612
What's he saying?

412
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,733
My father is deciding
whether to kill you.

413
00:46:18,773 --> 00:46:20,418
Your father?

414
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:23,860
It's nice to meet you sir.

415
00:46:32,938 --> 00:46:35,736
That is mother, she is Tsahik,

416
00:46:35,771 --> 00:46:38,533
the one who interprets the will of Eywa.

417
00:46:38,935 --> 00:46:41,619
Who's Eywa?

418
00:46:47,228 --> 00:46:49,431
What are you called?

419
00:46:49,465 --> 00:46:51,633
Jake Sully.

420
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:03,013
Why did you come to us?

421
00:47:03,048 --> 00:47:05,140
I came to learn.

422
00:47:05,175 --> 00:47:08,779
We have tried to teach
other sky people.

423
00:47:08,815 --> 00:47:12,386
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

424
00:47:13,107 --> 00:47:16,557
My cup is empty,
trust me.

425
00:47:16,592 --> 00:47:19,596
Ask Dr. Augustine,
I'm no scientist.

426
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:21,798
What are you?

427
00:47:23,122 --> 00:47:25,608
I was a Marine.

428
00:47:27,209 --> 00:47:30,376
A warrior, of the jarhead clan.

429
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,542
It is decided.

430
00:48:02,664 --> 00:48:04,867
My daughter will teach you our ways,

431
00:48:04,902 --> 00:48:09,157
Learn well Jake Sully.

432
00:48:09,193 --> 00:48:14,399
And we will see if your
insanity can be cured.

433
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:33,790
Good evening.

434
00:48:36,195 --> 00:48:38,438
Please don't get up.

435
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:45,728
Sorry.

436
00:48:47,812 --> 00:48:50,214
Hey, how you doing?

437
00:49:34,507 --> 00:49:37,049
Jake. ... Jake.
- He's coming out.

438
00:49:37,867 --> 00:49:38,611
Jake!

439
00:49:40,434 --> 00:49:44,020
Come on back kid.
Come on. That's it.

440
00:49:45,342 --> 00:49:47,627
There you go.

441
00:49:50,548 --> 00:49:53,513
You were talking like a tick.

442
00:49:56,437 --> 00:49:59,244
Is the Avatar safe?
- Yeah Doc.

443
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,449
You are not going to
believe where I am.

444
00:50:04,048 --> 00:50:07,514
The last thing we see
is this Marine's ass

445
00:50:07,548 --> 00:50:10,982
disappearing in the bush with this
angry Thanator coming after him.

446
00:50:11,017 --> 00:50:13,466
It's not something you can teach.

447
00:50:14,065 --> 00:50:18,674
For reasons I cannot fathom
the Omaticaya have chosen you.

448
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:20,875
God help us all.

449
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:23,400
Jarhead clan?

450
00:50:24,361 --> 00:50:26,050
And it worked?

451
00:50:26,085 --> 00:50:28,368
I'm practically family.

452
00:50:28,408 --> 00:50:31,857
They're going to study me,
I have to learn to be one of them.

453
00:50:31,892 --> 00:50:35,099
That's called taking initiative son.
I wish I had ten more like you,

454
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:39,422
Sully, just find out what
the blue monkeys want.

455
00:50:40,424 --> 00:50:44,911
You know, we tried to give them
medicine, education...

456
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:47,718
... roads, but no, they like mud.

457
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:51,925
And that wouldn't bother
me, it's just that their uh ...

458
00:50:52,926 --> 00:50:56,330
Can somebody just...
Sector 12.

459
00:50:59,616 --> 00:51:00,059
Stop.

460
00:51:00,398 --> 00:51:01,832
Where .. Stop. Jesus.

461
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,898
Their damn village
happens to be resting on

462
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:12,153
the richest Unobtanium deposit
within 200 clicks in any direction.

463
00:51:12,189 --> 00:51:14,959
I mean, look at all that cheddar.

464
00:51:18,282 --> 00:51:21,248
Who gets them to move?
- Guess?

465
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:24,854
What if they won't go?

466
00:51:24,894 --> 00:51:27,259
I'm betting that they will.

467
00:51:30,464 --> 00:51:33,189
Killing the indigenous looks bad.

468
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:36,991
But there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press.

469
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:40,477
And that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

470
00:51:40,518 --> 00:51:44,084
So just find me a carrot
that will get them to move,

471
00:51:44,123 --> 00:51:45,851
otherwise it's going to
have to be all stick.

472
00:51:46,361 --> 00:51:47,083
Okay?

473
00:51:47,929 --> 00:51:51,537
You got three months.
That's when the dozers get there.

474
00:51:51,572 --> 00:51:54,219
Well we're wasting time.

475
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:57,022
I like this guy.

476
00:51:57,058 --> 00:51:59,227
OK, let's run through them again.

477
00:51:59,308 --> 00:52:02,430
Moat: Dragon lady.

478
00:52:03,312 --> 00:52:05,524
Eytuken.
- Eytukan

479
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:08,523
He's the clan leader.
She's their spiritual leader.

480
00:52:08,563 --> 00:52:11,047
Like a Shaman.
- Got it.

481
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:15,137
Tsutey.
- Tsu'tey

482
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:18,057
He'll be the next clan leader.

483
00:52:18,858 --> 00:52:21,342
Neytiri.
- She'll be the next Tsahik.

484
00:52:21,382 --> 00:52:23,665
They become a mated pair.

485
00:52:24,386 --> 00:52:27,070
So who's this Eywa?
- Who's Eywa?!

486
00:52:27,672 --> 00:52:31,377
Only their Deity. Their Goddess
made up of all living things.

487
00:52:31,412 --> 00:52:34,909
Everything they know. You'd know this if
you had any training whatsoever.

488
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,406
Who's got a date with
the chief's daughter?

489
00:52:38,969 --> 00:52:41,291
Let's go. Village life starts early.

490
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:46,021
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

491
00:53:04,328 --> 00:53:06,731
Easy boy.

492
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:09,135
It's a female.

493
00:53:12,941 --> 00:53:15,265
Easy girl

494
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:46,273
That is Sa'helu, the bond.

495
00:53:48,276 --> 00:53:50,278
Feel her.

496
00:53:53,082 --> 00:53:55,605
Feel her heart beat.

497
00:53:55,639 --> 00:53:58,533
Her breath.

498
00:54:00,216 --> 00:54:02,418
Feel her strong legs.

499
00:54:04,421 --> 00:54:08,307
You may tell her what to do, inside.

500
00:54:08,947 --> 00:54:12,834
For now, say where to go.

501
00:54:14,714 --> 00:54:16,719
Forward.

502
00:54:33,785 --> 00:54:35,930
You should go away.

503
00:54:35,966 --> 00:54:38,221
Nah, you'd miss me.

504
00:54:38,257 --> 00:54:40,477
I knew you could speak English.

505
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,272
Again.

506
00:55:00,306 --> 00:55:03,212
If you want to hit this thing,
it's going to be complicated.

507
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:06,422
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

508
00:55:05,939 --> 00:55:09,087
There's an outer row of columns,
real heavy duty.

509
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:11,814
There's a secondary ring here,
and an inner ring.

510
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:15,027
There's a core structure like a spiral.

511
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,796
That's how they move up and down.

512
00:55:16,832 --> 00:55:19,640
We're going to need accurate
scans of every column.

513
00:55:19,676 --> 00:55:21,331
Roger that.

514
00:55:21,365 --> 00:55:24,017
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

515
00:55:24,052 --> 00:55:27,382
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load bearing.

516
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:33,561
Where are we going?

517
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:36,053
Getting out of Dodge.

518
00:55:36,089 --> 00:55:40,266
I'm not about to let Selfridge and
Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

519
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:45,716
There's a mobile link up as site 26, we can
work out of, way up in the mountains.

520
00:55:46,398 --> 00:55:48,764
The Hallelujah mountains?

521
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,132
That's right.
- Are you serious?

522
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:52,176
Yeah.

523
00:55:52,591 --> 00:55:53,349
Yes!

524
00:55:56,670 --> 00:56:00,442
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora, heard of them?

525
00:56:14,002 --> 00:56:15,972
We're getting close.

526
00:56:16,007 --> 00:56:18,417
Yeah, look at my instruments.

527
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:22,105
We're in the flux vortex.

528
00:56:22,144 --> 00:56:25,314
VFR from here on.
- What's VFR?

529
00:56:25,956 --> 00:56:28,644
Means you got to see
where you're going.

530
00:56:28,678 --> 00:56:31,255
You can't see anything.
- Exactly.

531
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:33,742
Isn’t that a bitch.

532
00:56:51,112 --> 00:56:54,603
Oh my God...

533
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,958
You should see your faces.

534
00:57:33,238 --> 00:57:35,766
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

535
00:57:54,301 --> 00:57:56,306
Welcome to Camp.

536
00:57:59,318 --> 00:58:04,131
So, this is my bunk.
- This stuff is nasty.

537
00:58:05,534 --> 00:58:07,621
Norm, go under.

538
00:58:07,663 --> 00:58:09,868
<I>Grace didn't miss a thing.

539
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:13,444
<I>She knew I was
talking to the Colonel.

540
00:58:13,479 --> 00:58:17,089
<I>But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan.

541
00:58:17,123 --> 00:58:19,375
<I>So she's playing nice.

542
00:58:20,178 --> 00:58:22,750
Jake, hang a left.

543
00:58:22,786 --> 00:58:25,116
You'll be in the link at the end.

544
00:58:27,121 --> 00:58:29,689
Unit 1, Beulah.

545
00:58:29,729 --> 00:58:32,337
She's the least glitch.

546
00:59:20,459 --> 00:59:22,450
Holy shit.

547
00:59:22,483 --> 00:59:25,173
Do not look in her eye.

548
00:59:33,075 --> 00:59:35,883
Ikran is not horse.

549
00:59:35,923 --> 00:59:38,932
When Sa'helu is made...

550
00:59:41,823 --> 00:59:43,910
Ikran will fly well.

551
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:47,441
Only one hunter
in the whole life.

552
00:59:56,065 --> 00:59:58,752
To become Aron'yu, hunter...

553
00:59:58,793 --> 01:00:03,287
You must choose your own
Ikran and he must choose you.

554
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:07,700
When?
- When you are ready.

555
01:00:57,713 --> 01:00:58,621
Okay, ...

556
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:01,823
This is video log 12.

557
01:01:01,857 --> 01:01:04,355
Time is 21:32.

558
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:08,561
Do I have to do this now?
Like, I really need to get some rack.

559
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,173
No, now, when it's fresh.

560
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,586
Location, shack.

561
01:01:16,626 --> 01:01:19,715
The days are starting to blur together.

562
01:01:21,318 --> 01:01:23,892
<I>The language is a pain, but...

563
01:01:23,929 --> 01:01:28,058
<I>I figure it's like field stripping a
weapon, repetition, repetition...

564
01:01:33,957 --> 01:01:37,450
If only you were stronger.

565
01:01:41,059 --> 01:01:43,067
<I>Neytiri calls me Scoun.

566
01:01:43,106 --> 01:01:45,994
<I>It means moron.

567
01:01:48,201 --> 01:01:50,609
<I>Norm's attitude is
improved lately.

568
01:01:50,644 --> 01:01:53,015
But it's not just I'm
seeing you in front of me

569
01:01:53,049 --> 01:01:54,699
I see into you...

570
01:01:54,738 --> 01:01:57,749
<I>It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a Scoun too.

571
01:02:00,036 --> 01:02:02,324
You've got to run, OK?

572
01:02:02,364 --> 01:02:03,068
Let's go.

573
01:02:03,493 --> 01:02:06,138
<I>I feel me getting tougher.

574
01:02:06,173 --> 01:02:09,026
<I>I can run farther every day.

575
01:02:09,061 --> 01:02:12,351
<I>I have to trust my body
to know what to do.

576
01:02:17,315 --> 01:02:18,569
Yeah, check it out!

577
01:02:19,918 --> 01:02:20,796
Crap.

578
01:02:25,383 --> 01:02:27,504
<I>Every day it's reading the trail,

579
01:02:28,365 --> 01:02:31,756
<I>track's of the wora'hon,
tiniest scents and sounds.

580
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:40,205
<I>She's always going on
about the flow of energy

581
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,948
<I>the spirits of animals.

582
01:02:43,418 --> 01:02:45,922
<I>I really hope this tree hugging
crap isn't on the final.

583
01:02:46,615 --> 01:02:49,494
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there you know.

584
01:02:50,082 --> 01:02:52,269
You need to listen to what she says.

585
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:56,215
Try to see the forest
through her eyes.

586
01:02:56,281 --> 01:02:59,214
Excuse me, this is my video log here.

587
01:03:14,179 --> 01:03:16,328
<I>With Neytiri it's
learn fast or die.

588
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:19,962
You got to be kidding me.

589
01:03:49,122 --> 01:03:51,688
<I>I talked Moat into letting Grace into the village.

590
01:03:52,596 --> 01:03:54,631
<I>1st time since her school was closed down.

591
01:03:58,143 --> 01:04:01,197
No you don't, come back here.

592
01:04:03,204 --> 01:04:05,409
Bon appetite.

593
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,737
Come on, Marine.

594
01:04:58,572 --> 01:05:00,945
<I>I'm trying to understand
this deep connection

595
01:05:01,278 --> 01:05:03,785
<I>the people have to the forest.

596
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:07,115
<I>She talks about a network of energy.

597
01:05:07,163 --> 01:05:11,153
<I>That flows through all living things.

598
01:05:11,193 --> 01:05:15,344
<I>She says, all energy is only borrowed.

599
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:19,495
<I>And one day you
have to give it back.

600
01:06:01,112 --> 01:06:03,064
A clean kill.

601
01:06:05,525 --> 01:06:07,449
You are ready.

602
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:36,488
Learning to ride an Ikran,
we call them Banshees,

603
01:06:36,524 --> 01:06:39,518
is the test every young
hunter has to pass.

604
01:06:41,302 --> 01:06:45,454
But to do that, you got to go
where the banshees are.

605
01:06:45,455 --> 01:06:46,456
Ooh-rah

606
01:08:49,204 --> 01:08:51,455
Jake Sully will go first.

607
01:09:24,385 --> 01:09:26,545
Now you choose your Ikran.

608
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:28,949
This you must feel inside.

609
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:31,428
If he also chooses you
move quick like I showed.

610
01:09:31,614 --> 01:09:34,663
You will have one chance Jake.

611
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,461
How will I know if he chooses me?

612
01:09:37,496 --> 01:09:40,058
He will try to kill you.

613
01:09:40,094 --> 01:09:42,977
Outstanding.

614
01:10:42,028 --> 01:10:44,548
Let's dance.

615
01:11:18,094 --> 01:11:20,392
Make the bond!

616
01:11:26,929 --> 01:11:28,924
Jake!

617
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:44,899
Sa'Helu Jake!

618
01:11:46,396 --> 01:11:48,396
Sa'Helu!

619
01:11:57,712 --> 01:12:00,192
Stop!

620
01:12:09,068 --> 01:12:12,064
That's right, you're mine.

621
01:12:25,979 --> 01:12:29,296
First flight seals the bond,
you cannot wait.

622
01:12:30,259 --> 01:12:32,895
Think fly.
- Fly?

623
01:12:41,053 --> 01:12:43,292
God damn...

624
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:49,047
Oh shit!

625
01:12:57,843 --> 01:13:01,281
Shut up and fly straight!

626
01:13:09,758 --> 01:13:11,241
That's it.

627
01:13:11,276 --> 01:13:13,478
Bank left.

628
01:13:21,672 --> 01:13:24,550
Level out!
That's it.

629
01:13:28,751 --> 01:13:30,498
Go Jake Sully!

630
01:14:15,647 --> 01:14:18,523
Yeah baby I got this!

631
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,444
Oh shit!

632
01:14:25,122 --> 01:14:28,722
<I>I may not be much of a horse guy,
but I was born to do this.

633
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:34,083
I came like this,
this you,

634
01:14:35,181 --> 01:14:38,694
I turn, I feel the wind,
I turn very strong.

635
01:14:38,728 --> 01:14:40,767
I see, I bank so hard.

636
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,339
The Tree of Souls.

637
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:50,885
Aybetraya Ramunam
It's their most sacred place.

638
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:53,401
See the flux vortex and
these full colour images?

639
01:15:53,998 --> 01:15:56,080
That's what messes up my instruments.

640
01:15:56,115 --> 01:16:01,582
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

641
01:16:01,617 --> 01:16:03,162
I would die to get samples.

642
01:16:03,772 --> 01:16:05,927
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

643
01:16:06,865 --> 01:16:07,990
You lucky swine.

644
01:16:15,366 --> 01:16:17,709
<I>I was a stone cold
aerial hunter.

645
01:16:18,252 --> 01:16:19,526
<I>Death from above.

646
01:16:20,447 --> 01:16:23,608
<I>Only problem is,
you're not the only one.

647
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,234
Dive!

648
01:17:00,615 --> 01:17:01,767
Follow me!

649
01:17:48,632 --> 01:17:50,944
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

650
01:17:51,896 --> 01:17:56,035
It is Toruk, Last Shadow.

651
01:17:56,915 --> 01:18:01,026
Right, it's the last one
you ever see.

652
01:18:04,595 --> 01:18:08,767
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Makto.

653
01:18:08,806 --> 01:18:11,679
Rider of last shadow.

654
01:18:12,177 --> 01:18:14,673
He rode this?

655
01:18:15,389 --> 01:18:17,352
Toruk chose him.

656
01:18:17,386 --> 01:18:21,457
It has only happen five times since
the time from the first songs.

657
01:18:21,492 --> 01:18:23,935
That's a long time.
- Yes.

658
01:18:23,970 --> 01:18:26,526
Toruk Makto was mighty.

659
01:18:27,442 --> 01:18:31,433
He brought the clans together
in a time of Great Sorrow.

660
01:18:31,468 --> 01:18:35,344
All Na'vi people know the story.

661
01:18:40,493 --> 01:18:43,171
<I>Everything is backwards now.

662
01:18:43,206 --> 01:18:47,077
<I>Like out there is the true world,
and in here is the dream.

663
01:19:08,347 --> 01:19:11,738
It's hard to believe it's
only been three months.

664
01:19:14,089 --> 01:19:16,726
I barely remember my own life.

665
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:21,963
I don't know who I am anymore.

666
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:43,300
Haven't got lost in
the woods, have you?

667
01:19:46,508 --> 01:19:49,836
Your last report was more
than two weeks ago.

668
01:19:51,761 --> 01:19:54,850
I'm starting to doubt your resolve.

669
01:19:56,775 --> 01:20:00,265
Way I see it, it's time to terminate
the mission. - I can do this.

670
01:20:01,067 --> 01:20:03,838
You already have.

671
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:06,000
You've given me good usable Intel.

672
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:08,853
This Tree of Souls place...

673
01:20:08,889 --> 01:20:12,298
Yeah, I got them by the balls with
that when this turns into a shit fight

674
01:20:12,332 --> 01:20:14,669
which it will.

675
01:20:14,704 --> 01:20:18,034
Now is time to come in.

676
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:23,008
By the way, you're going to
get your legs back.

677
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:26,935
Yeah, I got you Corporate approval.

678
01:20:26,971 --> 01:20:29,663
It's a done deal,
going to have you on a shuttle tonight.

679
01:20:29,698 --> 01:20:32,752
I'm a man of my word.

680
01:20:34,557 --> 01:20:36,966
I got to finish this.

681
01:20:38,568 --> 01:20:40,974
It's one more thing.

682
01:20:41,008 --> 01:20:42,900
Ceremony...

683
01:20:43,701 --> 01:20:47,190
It's the final stage of becoming a man.

684
01:20:48,273 --> 01:20:51,080
If I do it, I'm one of them.

685
01:20:51,923 --> 01:20:54,490
They'll trust me.

686
01:20:57,418 --> 01:21:00,946
And I can negotiate the
terms of their relocation.

687
01:21:14,182 --> 01:21:17,992
Then you better get
it done Corporal.

688
01:21:34,397 --> 01:21:38,249
<I>The Na'vi say, every person is born twice.

689
01:21:40,335 --> 01:21:42,847
<I>The second time is
when you earn

690
01:21:42,847 --> 01:21:46,951
<I>your place among
the people, forever.

691
01:22:46,591 --> 01:22:48,598
Come.

692
01:23:06,163 --> 01:23:09,775
This is a place for
prayers to be heard.

693
01:23:10,374 --> 01:23:13,585
And sometimes answered.

694
01:23:20,202 --> 01:23:23,412
We call this tree Utral Aymokriyä

695
01:23:23,446 --> 01:23:26,620
The Tree of Voices.

696
01:23:27,621 --> 01:23:31,033
The voices of our ancestors.

697
01:23:44,668 --> 01:23:47,074
I can hear them

698
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:54,694
They live Jake.

699
01:23:54,727 --> 01:23:57,700
Within Eywa.

700
01:24:00,711 --> 01:24:03,198
You are Omaticaya now.

701
01:24:03,237 --> 01:24:07,007
You may make your bow
from the wood of Home tree.

702
01:24:11,962 --> 01:24:14,764
And you may choose a woman.

703
01:24:16,365 --> 01:24:19,248
We have many fine women.

704
01:24:19,286 --> 01:24:22,569
Nenat is the best singer.

705
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:27,451
I don't want Nenat.

706
01:24:30,493 --> 01:24:33,575
Paral is good hunter.

707
01:24:34,257 --> 01:24:36,978
Yes, she is a good hunter.

708
01:24:38,378 --> 01:24:41,259
I've already chosen.

709
01:24:43,781 --> 01:24:47,383
But this woman must also choose me.

710
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:53,387
She already has.

711
01:25:22,524 --> 01:25:25,965
I'm with you now Jake.

712
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,408
We are mated for life.

713
01:25:34,289 --> 01:25:37,011
<I>What the hell are you doing Jake?

714
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:10,631
Don't forget the phase
integration, middle button.

715
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:12,752
You got to eat something.

716
01:26:20,519 --> 01:26:21,388
Jake!

717
01:26:23,038 --> 01:26:26,040
Wake up. Jake please!

718
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:29,763
Don't make me force feed a cripple.

719
01:26:57,479 --> 01:26:59,127
There, I'm done, let's go.

720
01:26:59,721 --> 01:27:01,361
And when was the last
time you took a shower?

721
01:27:01,899 --> 01:27:04,863
I don't need a shower.
- Jesus Marine.

722
01:27:08,195 --> 01:27:09,464
Jake!

723
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:17,416
Jake!

724
01:27:17,417 --> 01:27:18,238
Wake up!

725
01:27:18,339 --> 01:27:19,239
Jake!

726
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:20,340
Wake up!

727
01:27:24,541 --> 01:27:25,434
Hey!

728
01:27:26,817 --> 01:27:29,276
Stop!

729
01:27:36,081 --> 01:27:37,787
Hey boss...

730
01:27:41,701 --> 01:27:43,823
What? - I got a native
doing a funky chicken here.

731
01:27:44,133 --> 01:27:45,491
He's blocking my blade.

732
01:27:46,990 --> 01:27:48,369
Keep going, he'll move.

733
01:27:49,254 --> 01:27:50,932
These people have to
learn that we don't stop.

734
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:52,304
Come on, go, go go ..

735
01:27:54,715 --> 01:27:55,740
Stop!

736
01:27:57,103 --> 01:27:59,037
Go! Go!

737
01:28:00,315 --> 01:28:02,156
There, see, he moved.

738
01:28:13,032 --> 01:28:15,977
Woah, woah, ...
Dude, woah, dude, no!

739
01:28:16,238 --> 01:28:18,917
Oh! I'm blind!

740
01:28:30,311 --> 01:28:32,834
Jake!
- Neytiri!

741
01:28:34,234 --> 01:28:36,636
Come on!

742
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:03,331
Freeze it, right there!

743
01:29:04,733 --> 01:29:07,614
Scale up, enhance.

744
01:29:08,934 --> 01:29:11,136
Son of a bitch.

745
01:29:12,015 --> 01:29:13,938
Unbelievable.

746
01:29:14,418 --> 01:29:17,060
Get me a pilot.
- Yes sir.

747
01:29:37,386 --> 01:29:39,634
You do not speak here!

748
01:29:50,958 --> 01:29:53,159
Don't do this!

749
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,762
You!
- Listen, brother...

750
01:30:01,644 --> 01:30:05,649
You mated with the human!
- Oh shit...

751
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:08,690
Is this true?

752
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:14,136
We are mated before Eywa.
It is done.

753
01:30:14,173 --> 01:30:17,859
Brother please, do not
attack the sky people.

754
01:30:17,894 --> 01:30:22,177
Many Omatacaya will die if you do.
- You are not my brother!

755
01:30:25,258 --> 01:30:28,061
And I am not your enemy!

756
01:30:28,102 --> 01:30:31,503
The enemy is out there!
And they are very powerful!

757
01:30:38,386 --> 01:30:40,587
I can talk to them!
- No more talk!

758
01:30:48,712 --> 01:30:52,194
I am Omaticaya,
I am one of you.

759
01:30:52,229 --> 01:30:55,517
And I have the right to speak.

760
01:31:08,804 --> 01:31:12,007
These words are like
stones in my heart.

761
01:31:15,528 --> 01:31:17,094
Sir, I'm sorry.

762
01:31:17,128 --> 01:31:19,810
You can't interrupt
a link in progress.

763
01:31:21,011 --> 01:31:22,892
It's very dangerous!

764
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:25,701
Grace!

765
01:31:28,593 --> 01:31:30,069
Wait!
- Stay down sir!

766
01:31:33,709 --> 01:31:34,468
Look, ...

767
01:31:35,218 --> 01:31:37,701
I was sent here to ...

768
01:32:04,356 --> 01:32:07,957
Are you out of your Goddamned mind?!
- You crossed the line.

769
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:13,963
Wheel this meat out of here.

770
01:32:14,921 --> 01:32:17,844
Jake! What the hell
is going on here?

771
01:32:20,764 --> 01:32:23,247
You let me down son.

772
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:26,449
So what, you...

773
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:29,892
You found yourself some local tail

774
01:32:29,893 --> 01:32:32,454
and you completely forget
what team you're playing for?

775
01:32:32,488 --> 01:32:35,174
Parker, there is time to
salvage this situation...

776
01:32:35,210 --> 01:32:37,734
Shut your pie hole!

777
01:32:37,775 --> 01:32:40,222
Or what, Ranger Rick?

778
01:32:40,257 --> 01:32:42,920
You going to shoot me?
- I could do that.

779
01:32:42,954 --> 01:32:45,349
You need to muzzle your dog.

780
01:32:45,383 --> 01:32:47,741
Can we take this down a
couple of notches please?

781
01:32:47,783 --> 01:32:50,263
You say you want to keep
your people alive?

782
01:32:50,298 --> 01:32:52,349
Start by listening to her.

783
01:32:52,385 --> 01:32:55,866
Those trees were sacred to
Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine.

784
01:32:55,867 --> 01:32:56,870
You know what?

785
01:32:56,882 --> 01:32:59,152
You throw a stick
in the air around here

786
01:32:59,188 --> 01:33:02,830
it's going to land on some
sacred fern for Christ's sake.

787
01:33:02,866 --> 01:33:06,437
I'm not talking about
some kind of pagan voodoo

788
01:33:06,472 --> 01:33:08,633
I'm talking about something real,

789
01:33:08,634 --> 01:33:10,795
something measurable in
a biology of the forest.

790
01:33:10,831 --> 01:33:13,160
Which is what exactly?

791
01:33:13,195 --> 01:33:16,643
What we think we know,
is that there's some kind of

792
01:33:16,678 --> 01:33:20,159
electro chemical communication
between the roots of the trees.

793
01:33:20,201 --> 01:33:22,366
Like synapses between neurons.

794
01:33:22,402 --> 01:33:27,205
And each tree has 10 to the fourth
connections to the trees around it.

795
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:30,487
And there are 10 to the
twelfth trees on Pandora.

796
01:33:31,286 --> 01:33:33,287
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

797
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:36,810
It's more connections
than the human brain.

798
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:39,771
Get it?
It's a network.

799
01:33:39,811 --> 01:33:43,095
It's a global network, and
the Na'vi can access it.

800
01:33:43,129 --> 01:33:45,260
They can upload and download data.

801
01:33:45,295 --> 01:33:49,779
Memories, at sites like the
one you just destroyed.

802
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:50,781
Yes!

803
01:33:52,018 --> 01:33:56,302
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

804
01:33:56,981 --> 01:34:00,304
They're just Goddamn trees.

805
01:34:00,984 --> 01:34:04,306
You need to wake up Parker.
- No, you need to wake up.

806
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:07,039
The wealth of this world isn't in
the ground, it's all around us.

807
01:34:07,608 --> 01:34:11,266
The Na'vi know that, and
they're fighting to defend it

808
01:34:11,508 --> 01:34:14,096
If you want to share
this world with them,

809
01:34:14,194 --> 01:34:16,079
you need to understand them.

810
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:20,942
I'd say we understand them just
fine, thanks to Jake here.

811
01:34:22,364 --> 01:34:24,483
Hey Doc, come take a look.

812
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:27,365
<I>They're not going to
give up their home.

813
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:31,307
<I>They're not going to make a deal.

814
01:34:31,836 --> 01:34:34,357
<I>For light beer?

815
01:34:35,089 --> 01:34:36,877
<I>And blue jeans?

816
01:34:39,235 --> 01:34:42,813
<I>There's nothing that
we have that they want.

817
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:47,976
<I>Everything they sent me out
here to do is a waste of time.

818
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:55,495
<I>They're never going to
leave Home tree.

819
01:34:58,830 --> 01:35:03,829
Since a deal can't be made I guess
things get real simple, Jake.

820
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,031
Thanks.

821
01:35:06,067 --> 01:35:10,456
I'm getting all emotional.
I might just give you big wet kiss.

822
01:35:16,706 --> 01:35:20,041
I'll do with minimal
casualties to indigenous.

823
01:35:20,681 --> 01:35:23,646
I'll drive them out with gas first.

824
01:35:24,569 --> 01:35:26,974
It'll be humane.

825
01:35:27,777 --> 01:35:30,383
More or less.

826
01:35:30,464 --> 01:35:33,509
Alright, let's pull the trigger.

827
01:35:40,727 --> 01:35:42,890
This is how it's done.

828
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:48,590
When people are sitting on shit you want,

829
01:35:48,623 --> 01:35:51,954
you make them your enemy,
then you justify taking it.

830
01:35:52,752 --> 01:35:54,838
Quatrich just rolled in the gunships.

831
01:35:54,873 --> 01:35:57,724
He's going to hit Home tree.
- My God.

832
01:36:03,657 --> 01:36:06,785
Dr. Augustine, you cannot be up here!

833
01:36:06,819 --> 01:36:07,753
Back off!

834
01:36:07,789 --> 01:36:10,237
Parker, wait, stop,

835
01:36:10,273 --> 01:36:12,644
These are people
you're about to...

836
01:36:12,678 --> 01:36:16,406
They're fly bitten savages
that live in a tree.

837
01:36:16,441 --> 01:36:18,055
Alright, look around.

838
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:20,296
I don't know about you
but I see a lot of trees.

839
01:36:20,329 --> 01:36:22,179
They can move.

840
01:36:22,219 --> 01:36:24,424
Can you guys just please...
- There are families in there.

841
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:27,670
There are children, babies...
Are you going to kill children?

842
01:36:27,705 --> 01:36:30,438
You don't want that kind
of blood on your hands, believe me.

843
01:36:32,444 --> 01:36:34,607
Let me try to talk them out.

844
01:36:34,647 --> 01:36:37,012
They trust me.

845
01:36:39,538 --> 01:36:41,542
Calibrate the path.
We're going in right now.

846
01:36:41,744 --> 01:36:43,629
<I> Calibrating 3 and 4

847
01:36:44,266 --> 01:36:47,168
<I>Run sequence
-Initiating 30 seconds

848
01:36:51,365 --> 01:36:53,135
Listen to me,
you've got one hour.

849
01:36:53,169 --> 01:36:55,575
Unless you want your girlfriend in
there when the axe comes down

850
01:36:55,611 --> 01:36:59,385
you get them to evacuate.
One hour.

851
01:37:26,243 --> 01:37:28,248
Tell them they're going to
be here soon.

852
01:37:30,253 --> 01:37:32,578
You have to leave,
or you're going to die.

853
01:37:32,614 --> 01:37:35,545
Are you certain of this?

854
01:37:38,350 --> 01:37:40,757
They sent me here...

855
01:37:40,797 --> 01:37:43,046
to learn your ways.

856
01:37:43,082 --> 01:37:47,411
So one day I could bring this message,
and that you would believe it.

857
01:37:49,295 --> 01:37:51,264
What are you saying Jake?

858
01:37:51,299 --> 01:37:53,986
You knew this would happen?

859
01:37:55,829 --> 01:37:57,677
Yes.

860
01:37:57,714 --> 01:38:00,643
At first, it was just orders.

861
01:38:01,522 --> 01:38:03,848
And then, everything changed.

862
01:38:03,884 --> 01:38:06,298
I fell in love.

863
01:38:06,335 --> 01:38:09,101
I fell in love with the forest.

864
01:38:09,135 --> 01:38:11,867
With the Omaticaya people.

865
01:38:12,667 --> 01:38:14,671
With you.

866
01:38:17,238 --> 01:38:20,364
I trusted you.
- Trust me now, please.

867
01:38:27,381 --> 01:38:29,846
You will never be
one of the people!

868
01:38:29,882 --> 01:38:32,313
He tried to stop them!

869
01:38:42,735 --> 01:38:46,102
You have to go,
they are coming!

870
01:39:22,425 --> 01:39:24,830
Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

871
01:39:26,315 --> 01:39:28,323
They want to destroy this place.

872
01:39:28,357 --> 01:39:30,444
Neytiri, you must go now.

873
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:36,536
Get to the forest!
Run!

874
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:40,111
Run!

875
01:40:02,114 --> 01:40:04,484
Goddamn it, run!

876
01:40:11,897 --> 01:40:14,703
That is one big damn tree.

877
01:40:21,758 --> 01:40:23,608
Well, well, well ...

878
01:40:23,643 --> 01:40:26,730
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

879
01:40:27,852 --> 01:40:30,141
Alright people, let's get this done.

880
01:40:30,176 --> 01:40:32,744
I want every gas round you
got right in the front door.

881
01:40:32,785 --> 01:40:35,387
Roger, CS-40's going hot.

882
01:40:35,424 --> 01:40:37,474
Fire.
- Firing.

883
01:40:48,218 --> 01:40:50,223
Bingo, good shooting ace.

884
01:40:57,839 --> 01:40:59,842
Sir, they've opened fire.

885
01:41:01,446 --> 01:41:04,012
You got to be kidding me.

886
01:41:15,761 --> 01:41:18,331
These dumb bastards
isn’t getting the message.

887
01:41:18,366 --> 01:41:21,372
Let's turn up the heat.
Switch incendiaries.

888
01:41:22,857 --> 01:41:24,861
Fire.

889
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:49,556
And that's how you
scatter the roaches.

890
01:41:52,844 --> 01:41:54,848
Neytiri...

891
01:42:02,945 --> 01:42:05,592
We got to move, he's going to
blow the columns!

892
01:42:25,396 --> 01:42:27,401
Moat, no!

893
01:42:27,442 --> 01:42:29,925
If you are one of us...

894
01:42:30,449 --> 01:42:32,612
Help us.

895
01:42:39,668 --> 01:42:41,834
All call signs switch missiles.

896
01:42:41,638 --> 01:42:44,403
<I>Give me HE to the
base of the West columns.

897
01:42:45,846 --> 01:42:47,729
This way!

898
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:55,946
Yeah baby, get some!

899
01:42:57,869 --> 01:43:00,354
Bring it down.

900
01:43:06,446 --> 01:43:08,450
Come on Grace, move!

901
01:43:10,694 --> 01:43:12,698
Get down!

902
01:43:23,919 --> 01:43:26,289
Screw this.

903
01:43:26,324 --> 01:43:27,972
What the hell are you doing?

904
01:43:28,007 --> 01:43:31,414
I didn't sign up for this shit!

905
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,323
Go! Go! Go!

906
01:46:09,121 --> 01:46:11,205
Good work people.

907
01:46:11,244 --> 01:46:13,329
First round's on me tonight.

908
01:46:13,364 --> 01:46:15,132
Let's boogie.

909
01:47:09,718 --> 01:47:11,723
Neytiri!

910
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:23,806
I'm sorry.

911
01:47:23,841 --> 01:47:26,552
Get away!

912
01:47:27,593 --> 01:47:29,997
Get away from here!

913
01:47:31,079 --> 01:47:34,006
Never come back!

914
01:47:50,198 --> 01:47:52,159
Pull the plug.

915
01:47:52,195 --> 01:47:54,125
You can't do that!

916
01:48:13,281 --> 01:48:16,247
<I>I was a warrior who
dreamed he could bring peace.

917
01:48:17,571 --> 01:48:20,034
<I>Sooner or later though...

918
01:48:20,069 --> 01:48:22,500
<I>You always have to wake up.

919
01:48:38,211 --> 01:48:40,936
You murderers!

920
01:49:27,585 --> 01:49:29,992
What's going on brother?
Long time no see.

921
01:49:32,235 --> 01:49:35,201
Personally I don't feel these
tree hugging traitors deserve steak.

922
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:38,127
They got steak?
That's bullshit. Let me see that.

923
01:49:39,529 --> 01:49:42,013
Yeah, you know what that is.
Down.

924
01:49:42,053 --> 01:49:44,740
Trudy
- All the way down.

925
01:49:47,944 --> 01:49:50,751
Max!

926
01:49:59,167 --> 01:50:01,251
Trudy, fire up the ship.

927
01:50:02,293 --> 01:50:03,776
Here.

928
01:50:15,398 --> 01:50:17,523
Clear, come on.

929
01:50:17,558 --> 01:50:18,524
Here you go.

930
01:50:33,714 --> 01:50:35,318
Max, stay here.

931
01:50:35,357 --> 01:50:37,516
I need someone on
the inside I can trust.

932
01:50:37,546 --> 01:50:39,566
Okay, go.

933
01:50:52,471 --> 01:50:54,394
Clear.

934
01:50:55,676 --> 01:50:57,163
Come on baby.

935
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:00,287
Colonel, sir.
I got a situation here.

936
01:51:03,611 --> 01:51:07,298
It's sector 1-6
Unauthorized engine start.

937
01:51:13,791 --> 01:51:16,197
Come on!

938
01:51:16,918 --> 01:51:19,403
Mask on!

939
01:51:24,051 --> 01:51:26,055
I'm taking fire, let's go!

940
01:51:47,577 --> 01:51:49,702
Colonel!

941
01:52:01,604 --> 01:52:03,574
Crap.

942
01:52:03,609 --> 01:52:06,294
Everybody all right back there?
- Yeah baby.

943
01:52:06,334 --> 01:52:08,297
Norm, you good?
- Yeah.

944
01:52:09,339 --> 01:52:12,145
This is going to ruin my whole day.

945
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:14,794
Grace is hit.
- What?

946
01:52:14,831 --> 01:52:17,434
Get the trauma kit.
Keep the pressure on Grace.

947
01:52:17,469 --> 01:52:20,042
Trauma kit's forward,
on the bulk head.

948
01:52:20,077 --> 01:52:22,846
Hang on Grace.
- Doesn't matter.

949
01:52:23,449 --> 01:52:26,253
It's fine.

950
01:52:27,934 --> 01:52:31,142
Good to go?
- Take it up.

951
01:52:31,182 --> 01:52:33,186
Hold on.

952
01:52:37,795 --> 01:52:39,798
You're clear!

953
01:52:47,173 --> 01:52:50,219
Keep going north,
get us deep into the mountains.

954
01:52:50,254 --> 01:52:52,505
Copy that.

955
01:52:58,396 --> 01:53:00,118
Norm, you all good up there?

956
01:53:00,154 --> 01:53:02,644
<I>Yup, still here.

957
01:53:03,726 --> 01:53:06,029
At least they can't
track us up here.

958
01:53:06,064 --> 01:53:08,300
Not this far into the vortex.

959
01:53:08,335 --> 01:53:10,418
It's strongest at the
Tree of Souls, right?

960
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:12,802
Yeah.
- Good.

961
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:15,147
Cause that's where we're going.

962
01:53:22,831 --> 01:53:23,734
Ouch!

963
01:53:27,771 --> 01:53:30,057
You big baby.

964
01:53:30,096 --> 01:53:32,266
Are we moving?

965
01:53:32,300 --> 01:53:34,706
I'm going to get you
some help Grace.

966
01:53:35,107 --> 01:53:38,312
I'm a scientist, remember?

967
01:53:38,347 --> 01:53:41,363
I don't believe in fairy tales.

968
01:53:41,397 --> 01:53:45,607
The people can help you,
I know it.

969
01:53:47,209 --> 01:53:50,216
Why would they help us?

970
01:54:05,165 --> 01:54:08,851
<I>The people say,
Eywa will provide.

971
01:54:10,134 --> 01:54:13,741
<I>But no home,
no hope...

972
01:54:13,781 --> 01:54:16,547
<I>There was only one
place they could go.

973
01:54:30,093 --> 01:54:34,100
Link's running.
What's the plan here Jake?

974
01:54:34,136 --> 01:54:36,585
There's no plan.

975
01:54:36,627 --> 01:54:38,990
Tsu'Tey is the chief now.

976
01:54:39,030 --> 01:54:41,795
He's not going to let
you near that place.

977
01:54:41,836 --> 01:54:44,321
I've got to try.

978
01:54:46,324 --> 01:54:48,327
Launching.

979
01:55:09,049 --> 01:55:11,052
<I>Outcast...

980
01:55:11,093 --> 01:55:13,457
<I>Betrayer...

981
01:55:13,499 --> 01:55:15,461
<I>Alien...

982
01:55:15,982 --> 01:55:19,188
<I>I was in the place,
the eye does not see.

983
01:55:30,290 --> 01:55:32,554
<I>I needed their help.

984
01:55:32,590 --> 01:55:34,783
<I>and they needed mine.

985
01:55:34,818 --> 01:55:37,104
<I>But to ever face them again...

986
01:55:37,143 --> 01:55:39,908
<I>I was going to have to take
it to a whole new level.

987
01:55:47,924 --> 01:55:51,372
<I>Sometimes your whole life
boils down to one insane move.

988
01:55:54,056 --> 01:55:56,341
There's something we got to do.

989
01:55:56,380 --> 01:55:59,065
You're not going to like it.

990
01:56:08,285 --> 01:56:12,090
<I>The way I had it figured,
Turok is the baddest cat in the sky.

991
01:56:12,125 --> 01:56:14,377
<I>Nothing attacks him.

992
01:56:14,416 --> 01:56:16,064
Easy boy.

993
01:56:16,018 --> 01:56:18,620
<I>So why would he ever look up?

994
01:56:18,655 --> 01:56:21,222
<I>That was just a theory.

995
01:58:12,692 --> 01:58:14,776
I see you.

996
01:58:16,859 --> 01:58:19,782
I see you.

997
01:58:26,992 --> 01:58:29,794
I was afraid Jake.

998
01:58:29,831 --> 01:58:32,400
For my people.

999
01:58:34,403 --> 01:58:37,286
I'm not any more.

1000
01:58:57,634 --> 01:59:00,003
You are the leader.

1001
01:59:00,037 --> 01:59:02,441
And a great warrior.

1002
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:05,244
I can't do this without you.

1003
01:59:11,731 --> 01:59:14,136
Toruk Makto.

1004
01:59:21,345 --> 01:59:24,269
I will fly with you.

1005
01:59:26,393 --> 01:59:29,196
My friend is dying.

1006
01:59:30,477 --> 01:59:32,681
Grace is dying.

1007
01:59:34,002 --> 01:59:36,686
I beg the help of Eywa.

1008
01:59:47,701 --> 01:59:49,904
Look where we are Grace.

1009
01:59:56,912 --> 01:59:59,917
I need to take some samples.

1010
02:00:22,546 --> 02:00:26,552
Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is...

1011
02:00:27,675 --> 02:00:30,158
In this body.

1012
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:33,443
Is that possible.

1013
02:00:33,482 --> 02:00:38,569
She must pass through the
eye of Eywa, and return.

1014
02:00:39,290 --> 02:00:41,451
But Jake Sully...

1015
02:00:41,493 --> 02:00:44,256
She is very weak.

1016
02:00:44,898 --> 02:00:48,262
Hold on Grace.
They're going to fix you up.

1017
02:01:44,659 --> 02:01:46,661
Jake...

1018
02:01:47,382 --> 02:01:49,465
Grace...

1019
02:01:50,466 --> 02:01:52,748
I'm with her Jake.

1020
02:01:54,351 --> 02:01:57,396
She's real.

1021
02:01:58,467 --> 02:02:00,322
Grace.

1022
02:02:00,628 --> 02:02:01,269
Grace.

1023
02:02:02,817 --> 02:02:04,052
What's happening?

1024
02:02:11,796 --> 02:02:12,338
Grace.

1025
02:02:13,497 --> 02:02:15,500
Grace...

1026
02:02:16,902 --> 02:02:18,904
What's happening?

1027
02:02:24,791 --> 02:02:26,915
Did it work?

1028
02:02:31,601 --> 02:02:33,844
Her wounds were too great.

1029
02:02:34,404 --> 02:02:36,128
It was not enough time.

1030
02:02:37,328 --> 02:02:39,452
She is with Eywa now.

1031
02:03:12,855 --> 02:03:15,980
With your permission,
I will speak now.

1032
02:03:17,983 --> 02:03:20,306
You would honour me
by translating.

1033
02:03:27,516 --> 02:03:29,798
The sky people have
sent us a message...

1034
02:03:33,203 --> 02:03:35,686
That they can take
whatever they want.

1035
02:03:37,408 --> 02:03:39,693
And no one can stop them.

1036
02:03:42,817 --> 02:03:45,300
But we will send them a message.

1037
02:03:47,143 --> 02:03:49,545
You ride out as fast as
the wind can carry you.

1038
02:03:52,229 --> 02:03:54,752
We tell the other clans to come.

1039
02:03:58,438 --> 02:04:00,920
You tell that Turok Makto
calls to them.

1040
02:04:02,922 --> 02:04:04,845
You fly now!

1041
02:04:04,886 --> 02:04:06,808
With me!

1042
02:04:06,847 --> 02:04:09,852
My brothers, sisters...

1043
02:04:10,453 --> 02:04:12,935
And we will show the sky people.

1044
02:04:13,456 --> 02:04:15,982
That they cannot take
whatever they want!

1045
02:04:16,861 --> 02:04:21,747
And that this,
this is our land!

1046
02:05:33,365 --> 02:05:35,849
<I>We rode out to the four winds...

1047
02:05:37,691 --> 02:05:40,174
<I>To the horse clans of the plain...

1048
02:05:44,381 --> 02:05:46,903
<I>To the Ikran people of
the eastern sea.

1049
02:05:47,784 --> 02:05:50,788
<I>When Turok Makto
called them, they came.

1050
02:06:31,762 --> 02:06:37,369
Everyone on this base, everyone of you is
fighting for survival, and that's a fact.

1051
02:06:38,732 --> 02:06:41,856
There's aboriginal horde out there,
massing for an attack.

1052
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:47,544
These orbital images tell me,

1053
02:06:47,783 --> 02:06:50,988
that the hostiles numbers have
gone from few hundred

1054
02:06:51,068 --> 02:06:53,873
to well over two
thousand in one day.

1055
02:06:54,194 --> 02:06:56,676
And more are pouring in.

1056
02:06:58,599 --> 02:07:01,162
In a week’s time, there
could be 20.000 of them.

1057
02:07:02,083 --> 02:07:05,169
At that point they will
overrun our perimeter.

1058
02:07:05,288 --> 02:07:07,811
That's not going to happen.

1059
02:07:08,292 --> 02:07:11,577
Our only security lies in
pre-emptive attack.

1060
02:07:11,977 --> 02:07:14,501
We will fight terror
with terror.

1061
02:07:18,706 --> 02:07:23,661
Now the hostiles believe that this
mountain stronghold of theirs is protected

1062
02:07:23,890 --> 02:07:27,719
by their Deity.

1063
02:07:28,119 --> 02:07:29,920
And when we destroy it...

1064
02:07:30,241 --> 02:07:33,045
We will blast a crater in their
racial memory so deep

1065
02:07:33,127 --> 02:07:36,009
that they won't come within a 1000
clicks of this place ever again.

1066
02:07:36,249 --> 02:07:39,735
And that too, is a fact.

1067
02:07:51,951 --> 02:07:55,395
<I>Jake it's crazy here, full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.

1068
02:07:55,436 --> 02:07:58,841
<I>They got these huge
palettes of mine explosives

1069
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:01,083
<I>for some shock
and awe campaign.

1070
02:08:01,163 --> 02:08:03,247
Freaking daisy cutters.

1071
02:08:04,686 --> 02:08:07,250
<I>Quaritch has taken over, he's
rolling them and there's no stopping him.

1072
02:08:07,291 --> 02:08:09,375
When?
- 06:00 tomorrow.

1073
02:08:09,495 --> 02:08:11,577
<I>I got to go.

1074
02:08:13,579 --> 02:08:15,904
We're screwed.

1075
02:08:16,463 --> 02:08:20,188
And I was hoping for some sort of tactical
plan that didn't involved martyrdom.

1076
02:08:22,473 --> 02:08:25,276
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1077
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,722
I have 15 clans out there.

1078
02:08:31,684 --> 02:08:33,606
That's over 2000 warriors.

1079
02:08:35,209 --> 02:08:36,228
We know these mountains.

1080
02:08:36,609 --> 02:08:38,075
We fly them,
You fly them.

1081
02:08:39,134 --> 02:08:40,496
They don't.

1082
02:08:40,815 --> 02:08:44,503
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking, won't work.

1083
02:08:45,302 --> 02:08:48,426
They'll have to fire a line of sight.
If they bring the fight to us...

1084
02:08:49,227 --> 02:08:51,549
then we have the
home field advantage.

1085
02:08:53,031 --> 02:08:56,116
You know he's going to commit
that bomber straight to the Tree of Souls.

1086
02:08:56,636 --> 02:08:57,718
I know.

1087
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:00,123
If they get to it, it's over.

1088
02:09:00,443 --> 02:09:04,248
That's their direct line to
Eywa, their ancestors.

1089
02:09:04,284 --> 02:09:06,415
It'll destroy them.

1090
02:09:06,450 --> 02:09:08,934
Then I guess we better stop them.

1091
02:09:24,555 --> 02:09:26,876
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1092
02:09:29,282 --> 02:09:31,604
But if you're there...

1093
02:09:32,568 --> 02:09:34,889
I need to give you a heads up.

1094
02:09:36,571 --> 02:09:38,493
If Grace is with you...

1095
02:09:39,495 --> 02:09:42,019
Look into her memories.

1096
02:09:42,298 --> 02:09:44,823
See the world we come from.

1097
02:09:45,502 --> 02:09:47,704
There's no green there.

1098
02:09:48,828 --> 02:09:51,110
They killed their mother.

1099
02:09:51,632 --> 02:09:53,914
And they're going to
do the same here.

1100
02:09:55,714 --> 02:09:58,201
More sky people are going to come.

1101
02:09:58,440 --> 02:10:00,924
They're going to come like
rain that never ends.

1102
02:10:02,605 --> 02:10:04,929
Unless we stop them.

1103
02:10:08,614 --> 02:10:10,938
You chose me for something.

1104
02:10:11,658 --> 02:10:13,821
I will stand and fight.

1105
02:10:14,542 --> 02:10:16,625
You know I will.

1106
02:10:18,626 --> 02:10:20,951
But I need a little help here.

1107
02:10:27,039 --> 02:10:30,162
Our Great Mother does
not take sides Jake.

1108
02:10:31,965 --> 02:10:35,049
She protects only the
balance of life.

1109
02:10:47,065 --> 02:10:49,389
It was worth a try.

1110
02:11:37,052 --> 02:11:39,537
<I>This is group leader,
we're entering the flux vortex.

1111
02:11:40,857 --> 02:11:42,861
<I>Switch to manual flight mode.

1112
02:12:19,311 --> 02:12:21,391
This is papa dragon.

1113
02:12:21,433 --> 02:12:24,517
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

1114
02:12:31,844 --> 02:12:33,207
Suit team, go.

1115
02:12:33,447 --> 02:12:35,732
<I>Alright ladies, let's bring the pain.

1116
02:13:09,095 --> 02:13:11,100
Eyes up, check that overhead.

1117
02:13:12,180 --> 02:13:14,304
Watch those thermal scans.

1118
02:13:14,583 --> 02:13:16,706
<I>All call signs,
papa has lead.

1119
02:13:16,742 --> 02:13:18,789
<I>Pushing the target.

1120
02:13:18,870 --> 02:13:20,991
<I>Escorts, be close on my shuttle.

1121
02:13:25,397 --> 02:13:27,400
We are going to lose
some paint in here.

1122
02:13:28,802 --> 02:13:30,804
<I>Gun crews keep
your head on a swivel.

1123
02:13:31,606 --> 02:13:35,131
<I>Make no mistake people,
they're out there.

1124
02:13:36,093 --> 02:13:39,417
Alright people, target in sight.
Range four clicks.

1125
02:13:40,098 --> 02:13:42,621
Valkirye 1-6, get your payload ready.

1126
02:13:45,025 --> 02:13:47,027
Push to the ramp!

1127
02:14:00,765 --> 02:14:03,850
Hold position, we got
movement out there.

1128
02:14:03,889 --> 02:14:05,651
<I>Hold position.

1129
02:14:12,661 --> 02:14:15,266
Sir, ground has movement.

1130
02:14:17,187 --> 02:14:19,751
Fire in line!
- Targets closing.

1131
02:14:19,791 --> 02:14:21,673
Range 400 meters.

1132
02:14:22,073 --> 02:14:24,678
Can't you clean it up?
- No sir, it's the flux.

1133
02:14:53,116 --> 02:14:55,318
Brother, I'm going to punch
a hole, you follow me through.

1134
02:15:37,576 --> 02:15:40,259
All aircrafts, weapons free.

1135
02:15:41,462 --> 02:15:43,384
Brake right, come around.

1136
02:15:55,318 --> 02:15:57,602
Break formation.
Engage all hostiles.

1137
02:16:45,666 --> 02:16:47,949
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1138
02:16:58,364 --> 02:17:00,366
Jake, Jake you copy?

1139
02:17:00,687 --> 02:17:02,889
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1140
02:17:03,490 --> 02:17:05,093
Copy, get out of there.

1141
02:17:09,397 --> 02:17:11,422
That's him, get after him!

1142
02:17:27,721 --> 02:17:29,145
Take him out!

1143
02:17:33,293 --> 02:17:34,346
Oops.

1144
02:17:37,856 --> 02:17:39,860
Light her up!

1145
02:17:49,752 --> 02:17:51,956
You're not the only
one with a gun bitch.

1146
02:17:52,276 --> 02:17:53,957
Keep her in your sights!

1147
02:18:00,686 --> 02:18:01,970
That's it!

1148
02:19:37,377 --> 02:19:39,899
Rogue 1 is hit!
I'm going in!

1149
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:42,823
Sorry Jake.

1150
02:19:50,714 --> 02:19:52,717
Fire.

1151
02:20:09,941 --> 02:20:12,544
Tsu'Tey, brother do you read?

1152
02:20:15,228 --> 02:20:17,231
Rogue 1, you copy?

1153
02:20:18,873 --> 02:20:20,353
Trudy?

1154
02:20:31,088 --> 02:20:34,975
Time to target, 2 minutes.
- Valkyrie 1-6, you are clear in hot.

1155
02:20:35,094 --> 02:20:37,577
Copy dragon, we are
starting our bomb run.

1156
02:20:43,105 --> 02:20:45,708
Fire number one!

1157
02:20:45,789 --> 02:20:47,591
Number one armed!

1158
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:49,715
Jake!

1159
02:20:51,476 --> 02:20:53,480
I read you!

1160
02:21:01,811 --> 02:21:03,893
<I>Neytiri.

1161
02:21:04,413 --> 02:21:06,617
They are very close,
there are many.

1162
02:21:08,299 --> 02:21:10,386
Do not attack.

1163
02:21:10,422 --> 02:21:11,904
<I>Do you read me Neytiri?

1164
02:21:14,827 --> 02:21:16,310
Do not attack!

1165
02:21:16,549 --> 02:21:19,834
<I>Fall back now, get out of there.
That's an order!

1166
02:21:27,845 --> 02:21:29,648
Neytiri!

1167
02:21:31,249 --> 02:21:32,731
<I>I've got movement.

1168
02:21:33,052 --> 02:21:34,454
Hold position.

1169
02:21:34,854 --> 02:21:37,423
Something's coming.

1170
02:21:37,459 --> 02:21:39,459
We've got movement,
200 meters.

1171
02:21:39,495 --> 02:21:41,343
Get ready.

1172
02:22:04,774 --> 02:22:06,777
Get out of here!

1173
02:22:07,979 --> 02:22:09,984
Fall back!

1174
02:22:19,234 --> 02:22:20,315
Jake!

1175
02:22:20,916 --> 02:22:23,120
Eywa has heard you.

1176
02:22:28,926 --> 02:22:31,130
Eywa has heard you!

1177
02:23:21,316 --> 02:23:23,999
Sir, all escorts are
down or falling back.

1178
02:23:24,041 --> 02:23:26,204
Let's get this done.

1179
02:23:26,405 --> 02:23:29,488
<I>Valkirye 1-6, this is dragon,
press the target.

1180
02:23:30,010 --> 02:23:33,014
Copy, pressing the target.
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1181
02:23:53,160 --> 02:23:55,643
On my mark,
2, 1, mark.

1182
02:23:55,684 --> 02:23:58,648
Drop!

1183
02:24:50,116 --> 02:24:52,120
It's Sully!

1184
02:25:05,137 --> 02:25:07,540
Masks on!
- Breach alarm!

1185
02:27:44,270 --> 02:27:46,833
Come on, come to papa.

1186
02:28:14,070 --> 02:28:16,393
Give it up Quaritch.

1187
02:28:18,797 --> 02:28:20,719
It's all over.

1188
02:28:21,600 --> 02:28:23,802
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

1189
02:28:24,084 --> 02:28:26,326
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1190
02:29:22,562 --> 02:29:24,565
Come on!

1191
02:29:39,984 --> 02:29:43,991
Sully, how does it feel to
betray your own race?

1192
02:29:48,237 --> 02:29:50,719
You think you're
one of them?

1193
02:29:51,640 --> 02:29:54,325
Time to wake up.

1194
02:31:37,864 --> 02:31:39,866
Jake!

1195
02:31:52,363 --> 02:31:54,365
Jake...

1196
02:32:11,509 --> 02:32:13,511
Jake...

1197
02:32:28,934 --> 02:32:31,055
Jake! My Jake!

1198
02:33:12,591 --> 02:33:15,114
I see you.

1199
02:33:19,601 --> 02:33:22,284
I see you.

1200
02:33:32,417 --> 02:33:35,542
<I>The aliens went back
to their dying world.

1201
02:33:37,545 --> 02:33:41,028
<I>Only a few were chosen to stay.

1202
02:33:52,645 --> 02:33:56,170
<I>The time of Great Sorrow was ending.

1203
02:33:57,251 --> 02:34:00,335
<I>Toruk Makto was no longer needed.

1204
02:34:12,191 --> 02:34:17,078
<I>Well, I guess this is
my last video log.

1205
02:34:17,998 --> 02:34:20,803
<I>Whatever happens tonight...

1206
02:34:20,838 --> 02:34:23,094
<I>Either way, I'm not going to

1207
02:34:23,094 --> 02:34:27,211
<I>be coming back to this place.

1208
02:34:29,213 --> 02:34:31,296
<I>Well I guess I better go.

1209
02:34:34,021 --> 02:34:36,984
<I>I don't want to be late
for my own party.

1210
02:34:40,389 --> 02:34:43,232
<I>It's my birthday after all.

1211
02:34:45,315 --> 02:34:47,717
<I>This is Jake Sully signing off.
