Turn me around.

00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,833
Shit!

17
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,424
Good run, Kable.

00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,178
- My name is Tillman.
- Whatever your name is,

- you got to the save point fast.
- Who the fuck cares?

20
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,850
No one is getting out of here alive.

21
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,893
I am. I'm gonna make it out.

22
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,562
Sure you will.

23
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:14,648
They said you got 3 battles left

Bob!

25
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,455
Let me handle this.
Bob!

26
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,790
- Do we have the interview or don't?
- Yes,

27
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,208
we are cunt hair close.

28
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,295
Look I'm not going to blow the
3 asian wars for close.

29
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,340
With all do respect, Bob,
nobody cares about dead orientals.

30
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,801
- They care about Ken Castle.
- Can I hear it from Gina, please?

31
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,428
Okay, Bob...

32
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:49,933
Bob, are you aware that Castle has clocked
exactly one media appearance state,

33
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:53,729
and that was Walter's last interview
before she died, that would be 9 fucking years ago!

34
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,691
Stop menstruating and just tell me
whether we fucking have it?

35
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,860
We fucking, have it.

36
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,487
Good!

37
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,241
Okay, focus.
Let's get lunch.

38
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,951
Iranian, sushi or mexican?

39
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,870
Burger chili fried?

40
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,580
I could eat a burger.

41
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,584
We live in society.

42
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,087
We visit society.

43
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,839
I mean,

44
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,968
which one, which one is
more real? Really?

45
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,929
I mean, which one is really real?
You know what I mean?

46
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,521
<i>You're watching
Gina Parker Smith, alive!</i>

47
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,524
<i>World link tonight exclusive!</i>

48
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,151
This motherfucker is
off the charts.

49
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,903
You realize he could
buy the network.

50
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,530
Yeah, why would he?
The son of a bitch pulls

51
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,449
650 millions pay-per-views
for one single broadcast.

52
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:52,329
Going live in...
5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

53
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,166
First, there was "Society".

54
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,961
The ultimate sim environment,
where players don't control

55
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:02,548
virtual animated characters,
but actual,

56
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:05,175
living, breathing human beings.

57
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:09,138
They walked them, they talked them,
they juiced them, they rocked them.

58
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,017
Rickidy dickidy doo.
We had that on t-shirts
back on 2010.

59
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:15,394
The creation of reclusive genius
Ken Castle...

60
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,146
"Who is Ken Castle?"

61
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,231
"Society" took the
world by storm,

62
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,234
becoming the number one guilty
pleasure of billions.

63
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:25,070
You can get paid
to be controlled,

64
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,114
or you can pay to control.

65
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:30,284
And generating one of the world's
largest private fortunes,

66
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:33,245
surpassing Bill Gates
practically, over night.

67
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,251
Nine months ago,
Castle availed a new simulation.

68
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:44,131
One that would take gaming into new heights
of thrilling excess...

69
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,176
and controversy.

70
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,594
SLAYERS

71
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:52,348
Slayers, if "Society" let us
live through others,

72
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:55,309
"Slayers" could let us
die through others.

73
00:07:55,309 --> 00:08:00,189
Slayers gives the gamer full control
of a flesh and blood human being,

74
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,358
in full scale
kill or be killed combat.

75
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,652
And when we say "flesh and blood"

76
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:09,073
We mean, flesh...
and blood.

77
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:20,334
- Slayers.
- Slayers!

78
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,253
Why isn't it murder?

79
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,966
Gina, when was the last time you saw someone
volunteer to be murdered?

80
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:31,011
I'm sure you know that every last one
of our Slayers is a bonified death row inmate.

81
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,514
Each one offered the chance to participate
as an alternative to their sentences.

82
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:36,016
If you stay alive for 30 sessions,
you can get set free.

83
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,643
That's not a bad goddamn deal.

84
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,148
And has any of these men or women have
actually survived long enough to be set free?

85
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,944
Well I remind the audience that Slayers
was put together with a full cooperation

86
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,154
and approval, of the United States
Federal government.

87
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,781
That the revenue that produces...

88
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,367
is responsible for funding
our entire prison system...

89
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,661
keeping the bad guys
behind bars.

90
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:59,164
And that the prop was voted
for by a cock solid 68% of the american public.

91
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,042
In an election tainted by
a suspected digital fraud.

92
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,670
Let's talk about the
so called "genericons".

93
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,755
Sent into the Slayers environment,

94
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,843
With a set of pre programmed actions,
with no one controlling them,

95
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:14,221
and no way to react, their chances
of survival next to nil?

96
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,349
There's plenty of men and women in prison
who can never cut it to Slayers

97
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,853
shouldn't they be given the same chance,
roll the dice for a ticket out?

98
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,230
Besides they only need to survive
one session.

99
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,524
Right.

100
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,651
So Mr. Castle,
how the hell does it work?

101
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:31,739
It begins with a single nano cell
planted in the motor cortex of the brain.

102
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,034
This cell can replicate,

103
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:37,328
replacing the cells around it
with perfect copies.

104
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:42,666
And these copied cells contain
remote access functionality.

105
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,628
Therefore nano plus cortex,
equals a "nanex".

106
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,547
Is it true, that every human
that undergoes this procedure,

107
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,675
will have a distinct "ip" address,
like a mobile device...

108
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,677
- or a notebook computer?
- Similar, yes.

109
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:57,640
But control is strictly localized
with the parameters of our gaming environment.

110
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,642
You take "Society" for instance.

111
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:02,811
Once our cast member has left the workplace
they're completely free,

112
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,189
from the control and
monitoring of their player.

113
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,733
Oh well that's a relief!

114
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,735
For some, maybe.

115
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,362
For some...

116
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:20,412
Don't you suspect some folks wouldn't
mind a bit of controlling?

117
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,790
Someone else making all the
decisions for you?

118
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,753
No tough choices,
no responsibilities?

119
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,550
- Think about it.
- We will, Mr. Castle.

120
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,052
We will!

Oh, shit!

His arms are just so...
well I know they're terrible!

128

What the hell is that?

129
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,875
Ken Castle wants you to believe that
we are living in a better, safer world.

130
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,879
- His a liar! When mind controlling his Slayers...
- Mr. Castle, we have no idea where this is...

131
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,758
We will all be his dogs if we allowed
this evolution to continue.

132

That's a goddamn hoot!

Ah, Mr.Castle, we can't stop every
virus that sneaks in.

136

You might want to let my home boys

anybody but Kable. Kable, because
you're sitting and looking, huh man?

158
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:08,599
You're gotta plan in your head, you gotta mission,
you never break, you never snap,

159
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:13,562
you never say shit either, but you
take care of your business, don't you?

160
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:17,024
Niggers can get spooked by that kind of
single mindness, you know what I mean?

161
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,026
Cause you're spooky.

162
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,237
You spook me.

163
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,823
Whatcha in for?

- Sign it. Please Tillman.

My son David is your biggest fan.
He prays for you.

I need to prove it's authentic.
Makes it worth more.

173

Why would anyone want my name?

You don't even know what's

So what's your damage?

192
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:18,849
You know, just hanging out.
Just looking to meet people.

193
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,102
...meet people.

194
00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:24,397
Lucky you. You met me.

195
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:36,450
- I'm Nika.
- I'm Dale. I like your fur.

<i>Yeah it was.

214
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:05,248
<i>Sounds like fun.</i>

<i>Seriously, these Humanz cock suckers,

Who are they?

224
00:25:05,256 --> 00:25:11,429
Who the fuck are they?
Who the fuck is playing us man?

225
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,818
Shut up, fish.

226
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:57,934
Gay, gay, gay, tardily gay.

- Swarmers.
- Swarmers.

228
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:01,729
The latest innovation
from Browning,

229
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:03,564
this self detonating cartridge...

230

offers the widest

231

from a full tracking, cornering coordinates.

232
00:26:06,901 --> 00:26:08,152
- Daddy like it.
- Simon!

233
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:10,613
Fan girl, stop hacking me.

234
00:26:10,613 --> 00:26:13,866
You suck Simon. You're going to get
my boyfriend killed...

235
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:17,036
before he gets out of jail and
before he can fill me up with his!

236
00:26:17,036 --> 00:26:18,746
Simon!
I just wanna play you.

237
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:21,249
- Forget about that star fucker.
- Shut up bitch!

238
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,460
So when am I going to get to meet you,
for like, real?

239
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,212
What's that?

240
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:28,840
What's up looser?

241
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,259
Mum says: Go to college,
move the fuck out, and...

242
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:33,845
Oh yeah! You're a sick retard!
You're pathetic.

243
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,346
You smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.

244
00:26:35,346 --> 00:26:37,223
- Wanna make out?
- You wish.

245
00:26:37,223 --> 00:26:39,559
I can't wait until they
cut you out, Simian.

246
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,560
Your balls bitch.

247
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,603
- Simon?
- Maybe.

248
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:43,271
Oh my God! Is really you!

249
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:47,317
- Nice.
- Do you want to see our tits, Simon?

250
00:26:47,317 --> 00:26:48,109
Yes, yes I do.

251
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:52,488
Now that we have your attention, here's
an offer that you can't refuse.

252
00:26:52,488 --> 00:26:54,782
- Here we go.
- 50 million euros...

253
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:56,284
for control of Kable.

254
00:26:56,284 --> 00:26:59,495
instant transfer to the account
of your choice.

255
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:01,372
Kable is not for sale,
thank you.

256
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:02,498
Baby, make a hundred...

257
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:04,876
Spin the reel!

258
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:13,718
What the fuck?

259
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:29,984
If you want to talk to Kable,
we can show you how.

260
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,535
Look at it.
The new face of Slayers.

261
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:42,121
Pure, crystalized horror,

262
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:45,333
two stories high and
bathed in bloody red.

263
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:46,709
He is what they want.

264
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:47,794
They love Kable.

265
00:27:47,794 --> 00:27:49,170
They do now,

266
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,382
but when they watch their hero die
right in front of their eye balls...

267
00:27:52,382 --> 00:27:53,883
so sharp and vivid...

268
00:27:53,883 --> 00:27:56,886
if feels like it could've reach out and
touch the wet flesh.

269
00:27:56,886 --> 00:28:01,391
They're going to change their point of view
Be seduced by the power.

270
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:05,853
The violence, the dominance.
Is human nature.

271
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:08,731
Kable made it to 28 battles, every
player in the game is going to take him out.

272
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:10,817
Yeah, Kable is a perfect soldier,

273
00:28:10,817 --> 00:28:13,152
he's a tactical killing computer.

274
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:17,949
His only vulnerability is
the nanex itself. The...

275
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:19,826
delay between Simon's commands

276
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:22,996
and Kable's ability to execute.

277
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:25,164
So why should this one be any different?

278
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:27,876
Who controls him?

279
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:33,423
No one.

280
00:28:44,976 --> 00:28:47,186
Get it out of me!

281
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:09,125
What the hell happened
to this one?

282
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:11,252
Looks like he escaped.

283
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:20,803
Hi girls. Back to your exercise.

284
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,982
That's Hackman,
Hackman, Hackman, knack man.

285
00:29:32,982 --> 00:29:35,568
They say he killed a
whole bunch of people, man.

286
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:37,654
Killed himself all kinds of people.

287
00:29:38,655 --> 00:29:42,575
And then one day, he just walks up
and turns himself in...

288
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:45,870
like he wants to be inside
or some crazy shit like that.

289
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,372
You know what I'm saying?

290
00:29:47,372 --> 00:29:49,958
So it's going to be all
kinds of Slayers, man.

291
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:53,253
As long as you got motherfuckers like
that running around killing...

292
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:57,465
Kable! Let's go!
Upgrades, come on.

293
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:02,011
Why don't you upgrade
a brother man?

294
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:04,514
Why don't you shut the fuck up?!

295
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:11,479
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

296
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:14,065
Fucking, shut the fuck up.

297
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:43,970
- Who wimps?
- What?

298
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,724
Who wimps,
the player or the slayer?

299
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:57,108
Someone, somewhere else is the eye.

300
00:30:57,108 --> 00:30:59,319
It's tripped out, man.

301
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:04,908
Sometimes, they take over.
Completely, they...

302
00:31:04,908 --> 00:31:07,702
move you around like a robot.

303
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:11,080
- But that don't work so good.
- Why?

304
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:13,625
The delay.

305
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:17,253
Yeah the ping.
They talk about that.

306
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:20,924
About how long it takes the
Slayer to respond to the command.

307
00:31:20,924 --> 00:31:23,343
Whatever they call it,

308
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:28,640
the slice of a second out there,
is the difference between living and dying.

309
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:32,143
When that trigger pulls...

310
00:31:36,856 --> 00:31:39,275
it's just me.

311
00:32:00,755 --> 00:32:02,424
Hey, Kable.

312
00:32:03,883 --> 00:32:06,010
Look.

313
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:08,972
I just killed someone.

314
00:32:09,973 --> 00:32:12,350
This is the blood.

315
00:32:14,352 --> 00:32:15,979
Look.

316
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,776
He's back here.

317
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:23,403
Wanna see?

318
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:28,366
No your head
ain't working straight.

319
00:32:32,412 --> 00:32:35,623
I'm going to kill you too,
on sunday.

320
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:36,958
Yeah, probably.

321
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:38,960
That's why they put me here.

322
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,838
I got no strings.

323
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:46,718
I got no strings,
so I have fun.

324
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:50,597
I'm not tied up to anyone.

325
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:55,143
They got strings,
but you can see,

326
00:32:55,977 --> 00:33:01,024
there are no strings on me.

327
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:03,193
You go two whores, Kable.

328
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:06,946
- What the fuck you said?
- Outside.

329
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:12,035
I'm sorry,
I met your pretty girls.

330
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:16,831
So you want to get back to them.

331
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:19,250
But I'm going to visit them first.

332
00:33:31,471 --> 00:33:33,556
Alright.

333
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,856
Kable.

334
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:47,028
Kable. Kable, dude. It's me.
It's me.

335
00:33:47,028 --> 00:33:48,196
Who?

336
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:51,366
Simon, I'm playing you.

337
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:55,328
- How come I can hear you?
- Well it's mud.

338
00:33:55,328 --> 00:33:57,789
Gamers can't talk to cons.

339
00:33:57,789 --> 00:33:59,416
I know.

340
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:03,253
It's fucking unbelievable.
This is amazing.

341
00:34:19,853 --> 00:34:21,521
Cool yeah?

342
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:23,314
No it's not cool.

343
00:34:24,274 --> 00:34:26,943
Pay attention to the fucking game!

344
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:37,620
Okay, okay.
I got it, I got it.

345
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,955
What are you, 12?

346
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:41,958
I'm 17 actually,
thank you.

347
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:49,883
This is unbelievable.

348
00:34:49,883 --> 00:34:52,719
How am I not dead yeat?

349
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:55,764
Cause I'm a badass,
motherfucker.

350
00:35:08,693 --> 00:35:10,695
Shit!

351
00:35:17,077 --> 00:35:21,247
Freek, you shouldn't be here.

352
00:35:42,102 --> 00:35:43,979
- Gibs.
- What?

353
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:47,899
Like giblets. Chunks.
Pieces. Pieces everywhere.

354
00:35:47,899 --> 00:35:50,443
These are real humans fucker.

355
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,661
Death row, psychos...  so what?

356
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:02,289
They had it coming anyway, right?

357
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,846
I guess that goes for me too.

358
00:36:17,846 --> 00:36:19,931
Yeah, but you're different.

359
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,934
Different, how?

360
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:25,645
I don't know, because
you're in my side.

361
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:28,523
Damn new area.

362
00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:37,365
Think about it Kable, all the shit
we've been through together,

363
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:40,076
what an epic run, man.

364
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:42,245
It's gonna suck to see it end.

365
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:43,955
Are you fucking kidding me?

366
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:47,459
Oh yeah, I get that for you is different.

367
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:52,464
This way.

368
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,469
- There's nothing there.
- Trust me, kid.

369
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:00,388
It's restricted area. It's beyond
the border of the game

370
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:02,807
I couldn't put you there if I tried.

371
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:03,892
Warning.

372
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:05,518
Access denied.

373
00:37:12,943 --> 00:37:15,612
Very well.

374
00:37:16,446 --> 00:37:18,198
Shit.

375
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:32,629
Bye, Kable.

376
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:49,062
Come on.

377
00:37:49,062 --> 00:37:52,440
This kid will get me killed.

378
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,442
Dude I'm right here, man.
I can hear you.

379
00:37:54,442 --> 00:37:56,987
Listen to me.

380
00:37:56,987 --> 00:37:59,614
I don't know who's behind it or why,

381
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:03,577
but I was supposed to die tonight.
Lucky for us,

382
00:38:03,577 --> 00:38:06,288
I can beat them...

383
00:38:06,288 --> 00:38:08,331
but not with you controlling me.

384
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:10,000
What the hell are you talking about?

385
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,671
Turn me lose, kid.
You want to win? Turn me lose.

386
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:16,506
Find a way.

387
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:20,010
Bastard.

388
00:38:25,974 --> 00:38:30,770
So Ms Roth. Says here you're
applying for custody of your daughter?

389
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,356
Delia, her name is Delia.

390
00:38:34,149 --> 00:38:37,277
Spouse incarcerated, left without the possibility of parol.

391
00:38:37,277 --> 00:38:40,614
- You use your maiden name?
- huh-huh.

392
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:43,992
My husband, is...

393
00:38:43,992 --> 00:38:47,245
it's not entirely true
regarding his sentence.

394
00:38:47,245 --> 00:38:49,581
In fact,
he's due to be released soon.

395
00:38:49,581 --> 00:38:53,919
Ms. Roth,
your husband was charged and...

396
00:38:56,087 --> 00:38:58,465
charged and convicted
of first degree murder,

397
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:01,176
I can't hardly
consider his release,

398
00:39:01,176 --> 00:39:05,680
or if it happened at all..
I don't think it would be a good thing.

399
00:39:08,517 --> 00:39:10,644
So it's says you're an actor?

400
00:39:12,604 --> 00:39:15,315
I don't know that I've
seen you in anything.

401
00:39:15,315 --> 00:39:17,484
I work in "Society".

402
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:20,070
It's a job.

403
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,822
Ms. Roth, your child has been exceedingly well placed,

404
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:25,742
the new family is very wealthy,
she won't have to work for anything.

405
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:28,787
Now I can understand that
you love your daughter.

406
00:39:28,787 --> 00:39:32,958
Probably very much. But do you really
think she would be better off...

407
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:35,085
with...

408
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:36,878
people like you?

409
00:39:38,296 --> 00:39:42,801
Yes, I do.
I'm her mother.

410
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:49,724
We will give your application on
the consideration of merits.

411
00:40:13,582 --> 00:40:16,585
<b>Body armor purchased</b>

412
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:20,922
Do you like the software?

413
00:40:20,922 --> 00:40:22,007
Software?

414
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:23,967
The walkie talkie, player.

415
00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:25,594
No shit.

416
00:40:25,594 --> 00:40:28,889
You're the guy from the TV,
the Humanz.

417
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:30,098
That's right, baby.

418
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:32,309
You think about
what the brother said?

419
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:34,394
What brother do you refer,
brother?

420
00:40:34,394 --> 00:40:37,105
Kable wants the freedom to ass kick.

421
00:40:37,105 --> 00:40:38,899
Do shit his way.

422
00:40:38,899 --> 00:40:41,359
- Are you going to give it to him?
- You were listening?

423
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,153
We see and hear everything...

424
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:46,531
everything that goes on inside
that so called game.

425
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:49,743
Alright then,
Kable said we got lucky...

426
00:40:49,743 --> 00:40:52,496
They were gunning for us.
What's that all about?

427
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:54,664
Kable got a past,
he knows things.

428
00:40:54,664 --> 00:40:56,750
Things you don't even know.

429
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,711
- What things?
- Things that Castle is afraid of.

430
00:40:59,711 --> 00:41:03,799
As long as you boy stays on the him inside,
Castle knows he can keep him quiet.

431
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:08,804
But if he ever got out... Castle
would never let that happen.

432
00:41:08,804 --> 00:41:10,055
There's one battle left,

433
00:41:10,055 --> 00:41:11,890
I think I can handle my own business,
thank you very much.

434
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,600
You're not hearing me.

435
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,270
This is not something you can control.

436
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,272
They're gonna kill his ass, Simon.

437
00:41:19,272 --> 00:41:21,525
In the eyes of the world,
and then what?

438
00:41:21,525 --> 00:41:25,946
You're just another poor
little rich honky.

439
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:29,032
No cable, no pussy, no shit.

440
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:34,913
Look man, this... this is too heavy. I don't
even know what the hell are you talking about.

441
00:41:34,913 --> 00:41:38,125
- I just play games, man. Games.
- That's right.

442
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,085
It is a game.
You want to win, don't you?

443
00:41:40,085 --> 00:41:41,336
Yeah, I intent to.

444
00:41:41,336 --> 00:41:44,381
Then you need to cut your
strings puppet master.

445
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:48,093
Imagine a slave that don't got
to wait to be told what to do.

446
00:41:48,093 --> 00:41:49,970
No ping, you dig?

447
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:51,888
That would be cheating.

448
00:41:51,888 --> 00:41:54,307
A mod.
That's all it would be.

449
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:58,437
You know why?
Because the game's got to evolve.

450
00:41:58,478 --> 00:42:01,273
- You feel me?
- I do.

451
00:42:02,149 --> 00:42:04,568
I do feel you my,
giant brother.

452
00:42:04,568 --> 00:42:07,446
Well then,
let's rock baby.

453
00:42:13,118 --> 00:42:17,998
Tillman...
he knows you talked to him.

454
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:20,917
Your player.

455
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:27,466
- Who are you?
- A friend.

456
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,385
I don't have any.

457
00:42:30,385 --> 00:42:32,429
Listen to me.

458
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:37,017
Simon is going to give you what you want.
What you asked him for.

459
00:42:39,394 --> 00:42:42,814
- How do you know that?
- I know something else.

460
00:42:42,856 --> 00:42:45,275
Whether or not he's controlling you,

461
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:48,195
you will never reach the save point.

462
00:42:48,236 --> 00:42:49,905
Castle won't allow it.

463
00:42:49,905 --> 00:42:52,699
- We'll see.
- No, you have to escape.

464
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:55,744
Your wife and your
daughter need you, Tillman.

465
00:42:57,287 --> 00:42:59,623
If you want to get out and see
the people in the picture...

466
00:42:59,623 --> 00:43:02,042
you will have to find another way.

467
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:09,549
I need you to get me something.

468
00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:11,927
What? Tell me.

469
00:43:13,178 --> 00:43:16,348
Drunk.

<i>Kable's Last Stand</i>

00:44:01,852 --> 00:44:04,062
Kable, what the hell is that?

473
00:44:12,404 --> 00:44:14,031
Put it down.

474
00:44:15,198 --> 00:44:16,867
Put it down!

475
00:44:20,287 --> 00:44:24,458
Fuck face!
Throw the bottle in the trash!

476
00:44:43,852 --> 00:44:47,564
Oh, I see it was a great idea
turning you lose.

477
00:44:55,864 --> 00:44:57,949
- What happened?
- You happened!

478
00:44:57,991 --> 00:45:00,952
You wanted control,
you got it.

479
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:16,802
What's the matter with you, Kable?
Kill something!

480
00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:43,036
This is unbelievable.

481
00:45:43,036 --> 00:45:45,664
Kable, listen.
This is the last game

482
00:45:45,664 --> 00:45:48,667
you're going to end up dead and I'm
going to look like a total asshole...

483
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:51,670
if you don't pull your balls together, man!

484
00:45:54,881 --> 00:45:56,508
Damn it!

485
00:46:22,868 --> 00:46:24,453
Kable, what the hell are you doing?

486
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,922
Aw, what the hell?

487
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:40,469
That's just gross, bro.

488
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:12,125
Go, go, go, go!

489
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:15,671
I'm not your fucking cheerleader!

490
00:47:29,935 --> 00:47:32,104
Motherfucker!

491
00:47:46,827 --> 00:47:50,080
Kable, please, please,
I beg you, get back in the game.

492
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,708
You're screwing my ass, Kable.

493
00:47:58,797 --> 00:48:02,134
This is a restricted area.
Return to the battle zone.

494
00:48:02,134 --> 00:48:03,760
RESTRICTED

495
00:48:09,766 --> 00:48:11,768
I'm dead.

496
00:48:22,613 --> 00:48:27,492
<i>Sweet dreams are made of these</i>

497
00:48:27,492 --> 00:48:32,414
<i>Who am I to disagree?</i>

498
00:48:32,414 --> 00:48:37,920
<i>Travel the world and the seven seas</i>

499
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:43,050
<i>Everybody's looking for something</i>

500
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:47,638
<i>Some of them want to use you</i>

501
00:48:47,638 --> 00:48:53,268
<i>Some of them want to get used by you</i>

502
00:48:53,268 --> 00:48:58,357
<i>Some of them want to abuse you</i>

503
00:48:58,357 --> 00:49:03,278
<i>Some of them want to be abused</i>

504
00:49:38,564 --> 00:49:41,233
PLEASE STAND BY

505
00:49:43,151 --> 00:49:45,279
What the fuck just happened?

506
00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:47,990
Initial reports are that Kable,

507
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,951
the most recognizable face
of the Slayers phenomenon...

508
00:49:50,993 --> 00:49:53,495
next to Ken Castle himself,

509
00:49:53,495 --> 00:49:55,873
is officially listed as fragged.

510
00:49:55,873 --> 00:49:59,251
Just one session away from being
the first Slayer ever...

511
00:49:59,251 --> 00:50:02,129
to win a full pardon and release.

512
00:50:02,129 --> 00:50:06,008
And in NetCast, fledged by technical
difficulties and dead spots

513
00:50:06,008 --> 00:50:08,260
the report could not be confirmed,

514
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:12,222
however Kable, born
John Tillman of Albany, New York

515
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:14,850
and convicted of murder just 4 years ago,

516
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:19,021
has been removed from Slayers
rosters and upcoming events listings.

517
00:50:19,021 --> 00:50:21,857
His player, gaming mega star, Simon Silverton,

518
00:50:21,857 --> 00:50:23,650
could not be reached for comment.

519
00:50:25,194 --> 00:50:26,695
Do you have a question?

520
00:50:26,695 --> 00:50:28,780
Tillman left her away for the outside, right?

521
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,284
- Tillman, yeah.
- Find her.

522
00:51:01,688 --> 00:51:04,358
<i>Blink, activated.</i>

523
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,269
She's not home.

524
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:44,231
But Castle's personal security will be,
soon enough and trust me...

525
00:51:44,231 --> 00:51:47,526
- You don't want to meet them.
- Who are you?

526
00:51:47,526 --> 00:51:49,862
You asked me that once before

527
00:51:50,863 --> 00:51:53,240
- Your voice.
- You know, you should really come with me.

528
00:51:54,324 --> 00:51:55,951
Like now!

529
00:52:51,882 --> 00:52:54,218
See that's why you're a fool!
That's what I'm talking about!

530
00:52:55,803 --> 00:52:59,598
Could you stop

531
00:52:59,598 --> 00:53:02,017
Come one man, that's why
it's a game of deception, man!

532
00:53:08,107 --> 00:53:10,234
That's bullshit, man!
You know that's bullshit!

533
00:53:10,234 --> 00:53:12,236
So you're the ones who broke me out?

534
00:53:12,236 --> 00:53:15,030
- We only freed your mind.
- And your ass follows.

535
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,949
Holly shit...
You made it!

536
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:23,997
You're really here.
Kable. You're great.

537
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:29,753
- You got questions.
- A few.

538
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:31,922
So she took my blood.
Why?

539
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:33,924
The nanex.

540
00:53:33,924 --> 00:53:36,927
It modifies the actual cell
structure of your brain.

541
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:40,889
We can crack it, but it's not one size fits all,
we need your DNA

542
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:43,517
so that we can generate costume code.

543
00:53:43,517 --> 00:53:45,060
Alright, then why me?

544
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,812
Because Castle
is afraid of you man.

545
00:53:46,812 --> 00:53:49,982
It ain't just a game, Tillman.
Every day there's more people stepping forward.

546
00:53:49,982 --> 00:53:53,694
Want to be a part of Castle's world,
throwing away everything that means to be human.

547
00:53:53,694 --> 00:53:55,529
Right now is the desperate ones.

548
00:53:55,529 --> 00:53:59,908
Convicts, addicts, the sick, the poor.
The ones that fell through the cracks.

549
00:53:59,908 --> 00:54:01,869
The federal prison system
is growing out of control.

550
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:03,954
Set to bankrupt the whole damn USA,

551
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:06,373
then Castle rides in on a white horse

552
00:54:06,373 --> 00:54:09,460
Says he has a plan to bail us all out
and we just fall in line?

553
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,086
The healthcare system is collapsing.

554
00:54:11,086 --> 00:54:13,756
And this time he's pushing for
total control over genetic diseases.

555
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:15,841
Birth defect is no longer an issue.

556
00:54:15,841 --> 00:54:18,218
All we have to do is exchange our cells
for the ones he wants to give us.

557
00:54:18,218 --> 00:54:20,220
Promise of a longer life
and a fatter wallet...

558
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,222
- Do you think people will refuse?
- Fuck no.

559
00:54:22,222 --> 00:54:23,849
Then the next thing you know...

560
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:27,936
we're all slaves.

561
00:54:29,855 --> 00:54:31,482
I can't help you.

562
00:54:32,983 --> 00:54:35,778
Tillman.
We know where she is.

563
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,845
Hi, Nika.

564
00:55:43,637 --> 00:55:46,724
- Oh hi. Rick Rape, right?
- Rick Rape, right?

565
00:55:48,183 --> 00:55:51,145
I thought you weren't allowed
to come here anymore.

566
00:55:56,692 --> 00:55:59,028
That was last month.
I was a bad boy.

567
00:56:01,697 --> 00:56:06,785
Are you still a bad boy?

568
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:07,888
- Please, don't kill me.
- Please, don't kill me.

569
00:57:07,888 --> 00:57:09,682
No.

570
00:57:10,975 --> 00:57:13,727
- I'll do anything.
- Don't say that.

571
00:57:17,898 --> 00:57:19,275
Stop!

572
00:57:19,275 --> 00:57:22,361
Stop!
Goddamn it.

573
00:57:23,028 --> 00:57:26,782
You, in there controlling...
Let her talk!

574
00:57:26,782 --> 00:57:29,743
I can't she has to say what I tell her.

575
00:57:30,452 --> 00:57:32,496
You can hear me.
I know you can.

576
00:57:35,165 --> 00:57:36,500
I love you.

577
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,127
I love you too.

578
00:57:39,003 --> 00:57:40,838
Shut up!

579
00:57:41,922 --> 00:57:44,925
Don't say anything else.
I'm going to find you...

580
00:57:44,925 --> 00:57:48,012
and I'm going to rip you to fucking pieces,
do you understand me?

581
00:57:48,012 --> 00:57:50,055
I'm getting you out of here.

582
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:56,979
I'm going to take you to some place
where you can turn it off, the program.

583
00:57:58,105 --> 00:58:00,065
Hi Kable.

584
00:58:14,246 --> 00:58:17,082
Look at me bitch!

585
00:58:19,084 --> 00:58:21,045
Anybody in there?

586
00:58:39,188 --> 00:58:41,148
Go on.

587
00:58:41,148 --> 00:58:42,775
Do it.

588
00:59:44,295 --> 00:59:46,589
What the fuck do we do?

589
01:01:50,588 --> 01:01:52,506
I can get you out of here.

590
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:05,895
Oh shit!
I can't believe it's you!

591
01:02:05,895 --> 01:02:11,567
This is... listen, Tillman,
you can trust me, I swear.

592
01:02:12,693 --> 01:02:16,614
If not...
you're dead!

593
01:02:16,614 --> 01:02:18,324
Okay.
Faster! Faster!

594
01:02:35,883 --> 01:02:37,343
I guess you remember that day, huh?

595
01:02:37,343 --> 01:02:41,347
You just gotten Kable through his
10th consecutive session alive.

596
01:02:42,306 --> 01:02:45,017
No one ever thought an icon could last that long.

597
01:02:45,017 --> 01:02:47,228
Pretty hot shit, aren't you?
King player.

598
01:02:47,228 --> 01:02:49,146
Good times.

599
01:02:49,146 --> 01:02:52,608
Sure, on the outside.
Now look at these.

600
01:02:54,902 --> 01:02:56,821
That's what it's like on the inside.

601
01:02:56,821 --> 01:03:00,116
Wonder how long you would last
on the other side of the screen?

602
01:03:00,783 --> 01:03:03,494
You know, Simon...
you being held here today...

603
01:03:04,745 --> 01:03:07,707
suspected of aiding an escape
of a convicted murder

604
01:03:07,707 --> 01:03:10,042
from a maximum security penitentiary.

605
01:03:10,042 --> 01:03:12,712
The charges are beyond serious.

606
01:03:14,964 --> 01:03:17,174
Your hard drives have been seized.

607
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:21,387
Forensics are depicting the content
as we speak.

608
01:03:21,387 --> 01:03:24,014
Your internet activity over
the last 10 years,

609
01:03:24,014 --> 01:03:26,684
is being scrutinized and catalogued.

610
01:03:26,684 --> 01:03:28,394
In minute...

611
01:03:29,103 --> 01:03:30,855
vivid detail.

612
01:03:30,855 --> 01:03:33,899
In addition, your father's bank
accounts have been frozen,

613
01:03:33,899 --> 01:03:35,818
pending further investigation.

614
01:03:36,777 --> 01:03:40,698
After all, it was essentially his money
that funded Mr. Tillman's escape.

615
01:03:41,741 --> 01:03:43,325
Now I need you to tell me...

616
01:03:43,325 --> 01:03:46,746
everything that happened leading
up to yesterday afternoon.

617
01:03:46,746 --> 01:03:51,417
Anybody you talked to,
everything you saw, everything you did.

618
01:03:52,501 --> 01:03:55,755
And I need you to tell me that
right now.

619
01:03:55,755 --> 01:03:57,381
Yeah, huh...

620
01:03:58,591 --> 01:04:00,926
I'm going to need something too.

621
01:04:03,304 --> 01:04:07,224
Oh really?
And what might that be?

622
01:04:08,017 --> 01:04:11,354
Could you guys do a sandwich like...

623
01:04:11,354 --> 01:04:14,690
peanut butter,
or almond butter, walnut butter...

624
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:17,735
huh, pecan butter, pistachio butter..

625
01:04:19,403 --> 01:04:23,282
pretty much any kind of...
you know, nut butter

626
01:04:23,282 --> 01:04:24,909
with some grape jelly.

627
01:04:27,912 --> 01:04:29,872
Pistachio butter.

628
01:04:29,872 --> 01:04:32,958
- They make that?
- It's awesome.

629
01:04:48,057 --> 01:04:49,600
Now what?

630
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,396
Now we just put the DNA into the suit,
light it up, extract it...

631
01:04:53,396 --> 01:04:56,107
a few modifying sequences into the code and

632
01:04:56,107 --> 01:04:57,483
we're good to go.

633
01:04:57,483 --> 01:04:59,735
- It's an anti-spyware program.
- Basically.

634
01:04:59,735 --> 01:05:02,279
We can't quarantine the foreign
cells per say, but...

635
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:05,074
we can disable their ability to transmit and receive.

636
01:05:05,074 --> 01:05:07,618
Fuck that.
I'll make you cut it out me.

637
01:05:07,618 --> 01:05:09,745
That would be like cutting out
a part of your brain.

638
01:05:09,745 --> 01:05:12,581
The nanex cells replace the cells,
they replicate.

639
01:05:12,581 --> 01:05:14,208
They become you.

640
01:05:15,876 --> 01:05:18,587
We're going to have to keep her sedated
until we kill the link.

641
01:05:18,587 --> 01:05:21,590
Otherwise she will be broadcasting
everything she sees and hears,

642
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:23,509
30 minutes.
You give us a robot...

643
01:05:23,509 --> 01:05:26,971
we give you back a super hot female.

644
01:05:26,971 --> 01:05:28,639
Tillman!

645
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:30,266
We need to talk.

646
01:05:32,143 --> 01:05:34,312
- So talk.
- Come on.

647
01:05:43,446 --> 01:05:46,157
They tested on soldiers.

648
01:05:46,157 --> 01:05:48,784
The first volunteer was
the corporate Travis Scotch

649
01:05:48,784 --> 01:05:51,203
a friend of yours, I believe.

650
01:05:51,203 --> 01:05:53,497
And the second,
it was you.

651
01:05:58,252 --> 01:06:00,630
The idea was to replace your brain,

652
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:03,674
bit by bit,
cell by cell.

653
01:06:03,674 --> 01:06:07,261
The new tissue would never break down,
never deteriorate.

654
01:06:08,638 --> 01:06:12,266
A new era in human longevity, that's what they told us.

655
01:06:12,266 --> 01:06:14,393
9 weeks later Scotch was dead.

656
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:16,562
and you were serving life at maximum.

657
01:06:16,562 --> 01:06:18,272
Castle's project was shut down.

658
01:06:18,272 --> 01:06:20,942
But the same technology
resurfaced within a year

659
01:06:20,942 --> 01:06:22,234
in a game.

660
01:06:22,234 --> 01:06:24,570
Castle called it "Society".

661
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:28,616
Tillman, listen man, whatever happened in that
project, is something Castle wanted buried.

662
01:06:28,616 --> 01:06:32,036
We need that shit man.
What you saw, what you know.

663
01:06:34,288 --> 01:06:35,831
I don't know what to tell you.

664
01:06:35,831 --> 01:06:37,833
You gotta tell me shit.

665
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:39,502
I want you to show me.

666
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,049
Okay, we're ready to rock.
We're ready to break the link in...

667
01:06:45,049 --> 01:06:47,843
3... 2... 1.

668
01:06:57,895 --> 01:06:59,480
Who's there?

669
01:07:05,278 --> 01:07:07,196
What are you doing here?

670
01:07:08,656 --> 01:07:11,492
- Who are you?
- Tech support.

671
01:07:11,492 --> 01:07:13,119
SOCIETY
LINK FAILURE

672
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:25,631
- What are we looking at?
- His memories.

673
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:28,426
Translating into raw audiovisual data.

674
01:07:29,886 --> 01:07:31,596
I read something about this.

675
01:07:31,596 --> 01:07:34,682
But that tech is not supposed to be
available for another decade.

676
01:07:34,682 --> 01:07:37,768
They'll have better shit than
this in Best Buy in 18 months.

677
01:07:46,277 --> 01:07:48,905
Son of a bitch!
John Tillman.

678
01:07:48,905 --> 01:07:52,491
Man I never thought I would be so
happy to see your ugly face.

679
01:07:53,576 --> 01:07:56,871
Scotch.

680
01:07:58,539 --> 01:08:01,876
<i>Is it me or is this place fucked?</i>

681
01:08:02,585 --> 01:08:05,087
<i>They got me hooked up to
computers 5 hours a day.</i>

682
01:08:06,255 --> 01:08:09,217
Feed me vitamins, and pills,
and god knows what

683
01:08:09,217 --> 01:08:11,677
giving me injections, taking and giving me blood...

684
01:08:11,677 --> 01:08:16,057
These nurses are whipping my ass...
and there are male nurses to bro!

685
01:08:17,308 --> 01:08:19,310
I can't believe I let you
talk me in to this.

686
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:23,731
And I'm having these, like, blackouts...
and is scaring the shit out of me.

687
01:08:23,731 --> 01:08:25,566
I don't even know how long I've been here

688
01:08:28,528 --> 01:08:30,780
Hey man...

689
01:08:32,823 --> 01:08:35,076
<i>Are they letting you out already,
you son of a bitch?</i>

690
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:39,288
I'm not getting out.

691
01:08:39,288 --> 01:08:40,957
Okay.

692
01:08:45,419 --> 01:08:47,713
Johnny...
Are you good?

693
01:08:49,632 --> 01:08:50,758
I'm fine.

694
01:08:50,758 --> 01:08:52,552
Man you don't look fine.

695
01:08:55,137 --> 01:08:56,472
I'm sorry.

696
01:08:56,472 --> 01:08:58,099
Yeah that's okay.

697
01:08:59,392 --> 01:09:01,811
It's not like you ever been that
good in the first place.

698
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,945
What's the gun for, John?

699
01:09:10,945 --> 01:09:12,572
What's happening?

700
01:09:13,823 --> 01:09:16,284
Really you're scaring me man.
What's the gun for?

701
01:09:16,284 --> 01:09:17,743
I can't st...

702
01:09:17,743 --> 01:09:19,620
I can't stop.

703
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:22,123
Stop what?
What did they do to you man?

704
01:09:24,834 --> 01:09:27,128
John, stop it! You're scaring me now.
Stop it.

705
01:09:27,128 --> 01:09:28,754
Sorry Scotch, I...

706
01:09:30,089 --> 01:09:31,716
John, no! Don't!
Stop!

707
01:09:44,187 --> 01:09:46,564
Not the best commercial for Ken Castle.

708
01:09:46,564 --> 01:09:47,982
They made them do it.

709
01:09:47,982 --> 01:09:49,942
- Castle made them do it.
- It was a test.

710
01:09:49,942 --> 01:09:51,110
Touching.

711
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:53,029
Excuse me,
media whore.

712
01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:54,906
This isn't just a story.

713
01:09:54,906 --> 01:09:56,991
The whole world is splitting down the middle.

714
01:09:56,991 --> 01:09:59,410
Sooner or later,
everyone is going to have to take a side,

715
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:01,037
even scavengers like you!

716
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:42,870
It's you.

717
01:10:50,461 --> 01:10:52,672
I missed you, so much!

718
01:10:52,672 --> 01:10:54,966
You are the reason I held on.

719
01:11:00,138 --> 01:11:02,682
- I love you.
- Where's our daughter?

720
01:11:08,771 --> 01:11:10,565
I couldn't stop them. I'm sorry.

721
01:11:10,565 --> 01:11:12,817
Nobody could.

722
01:11:12,817 --> 01:11:16,446
The foster parents paid good money
to remain anonymous.

723
01:11:16,446 --> 01:11:19,073
But there's always a data trail
if you know where to look.

724
01:11:19,073 --> 01:11:20,450
Where is she?

725
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:21,993
I'm sorry, Tillman.

726
01:11:21,993 --> 01:11:23,953
She's with Castle.

727
01:11:40,303 --> 01:11:41,929
Tillman!

728
01:11:43,806 --> 01:11:46,184
That's all the story
you're going to get.

729
01:11:59,447 --> 01:12:01,074
Silverton, get up.

730
01:12:03,367 --> 01:12:05,578
What's going on man?

731
01:12:05,578 --> 01:12:08,915
Looks like someone up the chain
has decided you're no longer a threat.

732
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,801
CHEATER

733
01:12:19,801 --> 01:12:22,303
FUCK YOU CHEATER!

734
01:12:28,351 --> 01:12:32,897
NANEX
ACCESS DENIED

735
01:12:37,652 --> 01:12:39,404
We'll find him.

736
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:42,156
Don't worry.

737
01:12:42,824 --> 01:12:44,534
We'll come to us.

738
01:12:46,285 --> 01:12:49,455
KABLE, THE FALLEN HERO OF SLAYER
REST IN PEACE

739
01:14:00,026 --> 01:14:02,779
- Not bad for a video, huh?
- What?

740
01:14:02,779 --> 01:14:06,366
The latest and greatest, I defy you
to tell it from real life...

741
01:14:06,366 --> 01:14:08,201
could you imagine porn on this thing?

742
01:14:49,492 --> 01:14:55,623
<i>I've got you under my skin</i>

743
01:14:55,623 --> 01:15:01,879
<i>I've got you deep
in the heart of me.</i>

744
01:15:02,422 --> 01:15:04,841
<i>So deep in my heart</i>

745
01:15:04,882 --> 01:15:08,886
<i>that you're really a part of me</i>

746
01:15:09,929 --> 01:15:15,310
<i>I've got you under my skin</i>

747
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:20,231
<i>I'd tried so not to give in</i>

748
01:15:22,358 --> 01:15:27,697
<i>I said to myself:
this affair never will go so well</i>

749
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:34,787
<i>But why should I try to resist
when, baby, I know so well</i>

750
01:15:34,787 --> 01:15:41,044
<i>I've got you...</i>

751
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:44,297
<i>under my skin.</i>

752
01:15:46,132 --> 01:15:49,260
<i>I'd sacrifice anything come what might</i>

753
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:52,680
<i>For the sake of havin' you near.</i>

754
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:56,601
<i>In spite of a warnin'
voice that comes in the night</i>

755
01:15:56,601 --> 01:15:59,896
<i>And repeats, repeats in my ear...</i>

756
01:15:59,896 --> 01:16:05,985
<i>Don't you know, little
fool, you never can win?</i>

757
01:16:05,985 --> 01:16:12,241
<i>Use your mentality,
wake up to reality.</i>

758
01:16:12,784 --> 01:16:18,164
<i>But each time that I do
just the thought of you</i>

759
01:16:18,164 --> 01:16:20,625
<i>Makes me stop before I begin</i>

760
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:24,462
<i>'Cause I've got you under my skin</i>

761
01:16:27,799 --> 01:16:32,220
<i>under my skin.</i>

762
01:16:36,432 --> 01:16:37,725
You're awesome!

763
01:16:37,725 --> 01:16:39,102
Castle.

764
01:16:39,102 --> 01:16:40,728
Kable.

765
01:16:42,021 --> 01:16:43,523
I don't care about you.

766
01:16:43,523 --> 01:16:45,900
You just want your little
sugar pie, I know.

767
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,568
So don't do anything stupid.

768
01:16:48,361 --> 01:16:49,946
My house, my rules.

769
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,657
Come on, I want to show you something

770
01:16:59,205 --> 01:17:01,791
I wanted to thank you for
leading me into them,

771
01:17:01,791 --> 01:17:04,335
the Humanzuz's cell, that is.

772
01:17:05,753 --> 01:17:08,673
Of course sooner or later they
would be whistling my tune

773
01:17:08,673 --> 01:17:10,466
just like everybody else, but...

774
01:17:10,466 --> 01:17:13,845
Meantime, there's that little cracker
program they dreamed of that got my attention.

775
01:17:13,845 --> 01:17:15,972
That was a genuine disuse, no doubt about it

776
01:17:15,972 --> 01:17:18,266
One thing even they didn't know, though,

777
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,393
I'm wired too.

778
01:17:20,393 --> 01:17:25,523
I replaced 98% of my own noodle
with nano-tissue years ago.

779
01:17:25,523 --> 01:17:29,068
But mine's different.
It's built to send,

780
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:32,530
to transmit,

781
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:34,991
whereas every other nano-cell
that I've put out there,

782
01:17:34,991 --> 01:17:37,952
including the ones
in your head Kable,

783
01:17:37,952 --> 01:17:40,246
are designed to receive.

784
01:17:40,246 --> 01:17:42,916
I think it, you do it.

785
01:17:50,715 --> 01:17:53,635
We're talking every Slayer,
everyone in Society city.

786
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:56,179
I believe your better half would
fall under that category,

787
01:17:56,179 --> 01:17:58,848
provided they were within
range of my transmitters.

788
01:17:58,848 --> 01:18:02,352
Very nice, Castle. So you got
an army of psychotics

789
01:18:02,352 --> 01:18:04,771
and deviants to dance around for you?

790
01:18:04,771 --> 01:18:10,235
You're thinking small, Kable.
But not as small as me.

791
01:18:10,235 --> 01:18:12,529
See, nano-cells are real small.

792
01:18:12,529 --> 01:18:16,115
A thousand times smaller than
these dust particulars.

793
01:18:17,075 --> 01:18:19,619
You inhale it. They go to work;
replicating, spreading

794
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:22,664
like a virus, multiplying
in exponentials.

795
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:26,125
Six months time, I can have a
hundred million people converted.

796
01:18:26,125 --> 01:18:28,795
Ditch diggers, porn stars,
and presidents.

797
01:18:28,795 --> 01:18:30,213
Not one would be the wiser.

798
01:18:30,213 --> 01:18:33,258
A hundred million people who buy
what I want them to buy,

799
01:18:33,258 --> 01:18:35,426
vote how I want them to vote,

800
01:18:35,426 --> 01:18:39,180
do pretty much damn well anything
I figure they ought to do.

801
01:18:39,931 --> 01:18:41,516
For instance...

802
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:20,305
You should have let him
fight for himself.

803
01:19:21,514 --> 01:19:23,224
Maybe you would've had a shot.

804
01:19:23,224 --> 01:19:26,436
- I think you're missing the point, my man.
- No no, I get it.

805
01:19:26,436 --> 01:19:27,937
You're pulling all the strings around here.

806
01:19:27,937 --> 01:19:30,607
Which makes my next move pretty...

807
01:19:32,775 --> 01:19:34,569
Neglected to mention my smart boys reversed

808
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:36,905
that crack the Humanz worked for you.

809
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:39,782
Easy breezy once I had access to their drives.

810
01:19:49,667 --> 01:19:53,379
<i>You're mine boy.</i>

811
01:20:10,897 --> 01:20:12,816
Come one, let's boogey wooguey
rock n' roll.

812
01:20:20,281 --> 01:20:23,284
I think that badass Slayer of the game
don't seem like much, does he?

813
01:20:31,334 --> 01:20:32,961
Lucky shot

814
01:20:35,338 --> 01:20:36,965
Not really.

815
01:20:49,102 --> 01:20:51,563
I need an audience
boys...

816
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:14,878
No no no, you crawl...
on your belly like a toad.

817
01:21:14,878 --> 01:21:17,172
Is this bad?
I'm really bad.

818
01:21:17,797 --> 01:21:19,841
<i>Is this bad?
I'm really bad.</i>

819
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:28,475
That's sweet.

820
01:21:31,269 --> 01:21:34,939
Alright boys are you ready?
It's time for a true test.

821
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:38,818
Just like last time, remember?

822
01:21:41,613 --> 01:21:44,616
Yeah, you're stronger now,
a little more fighting...

823
01:21:44,616 --> 01:21:47,619
But I think the end result
will be just about the same.

824
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:08,681
What the hell was that?

825
01:22:08,681 --> 01:22:11,226
Someone from the outside
is sending him commands...

826
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:13,311
We're being broadcast live.

827
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:16,898
Jam the signal!

828
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:19,442
Goddamn retards!

829
01:22:19,442 --> 01:22:21,069
We're working on it...

830
01:22:22,779 --> 01:22:24,406
I think it,

831
01:22:24,948 --> 01:22:27,450
You... fucking... do it...

832
01:22:36,376 --> 01:22:38,461
Look at this knife...

833
01:22:38,461 --> 01:22:40,547
imagine me sticking it into your gut.

834
01:22:42,132 --> 01:22:45,635
Think about it...
make it real!

835
01:23:17,709 --> 01:23:19,335
Yes!

836
01:23:40,398 --> 01:23:44,402
- Are you okay?
- Are you my daddy, Tillman?

837
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:48,656
I'm your daddy.

838
01:23:53,745 --> 01:23:55,372
Wait.

839
01:23:56,915 --> 01:23:59,042
- Shut it off.
- Pardon?

840
01:23:59,042 --> 01:24:01,127
The nanex.

841
01:24:02,128 --> 01:24:05,840
It's nothing to you.
Just a mouse click.

842
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,425
Set us free.

843
01:24:13,473 --> 01:24:15,183
Well played, Kable.
