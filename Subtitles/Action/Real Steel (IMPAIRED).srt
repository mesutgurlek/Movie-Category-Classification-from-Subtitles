What are you doing?

You want five dollars? Seriously?

- Yes, sir. We did.

Well, Charlie, I'll tell you something.

- Twenty grand, winner takes all.

- You got 20 grand, Charlie?
- In a safe in my truck.

69
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,250
All right, Charlie.
I'll tell you what,

00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,670
twenty grand it is,
but if you lose and you welch,

Now, listen, friends, I understand,

00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:54,163
we can't all afford to go all
the way over there to Dallas

because there will be one.

Sure. For five dollars.

One more step
and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.

152

Charlie, relax.

153
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,537
I'm not paying you.
That was a bogus fight.

154
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,789
- It cost me my last robot.
- Just listen to us.

- She's my ex-girlfriend.

I haven't seen her in like ten years.
What does she want?

00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:14,632
- Nothing. She died.
- Do you recall Max Kenton?

158
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,094
He's my son.
He's got to be like nine.

159
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:19,929
- Eleven.
- Eleven. OK.

160
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,848
[sighs] Is he dead, too?

161
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,851
No, he's fine.
That's why we're here.

162
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,521
[soft music playing]

163
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,798
[man] This court is convened
to address the custodial status

164
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:59,010
of one Max Kenton, age 11.

165
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,095
Mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased.

166
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,888
Father, Charles Kenton.

167
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,099
Debra Fallon Barnes,
you're the boy's aunt.

168
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:08,728
Yes. As I've already told you,

169
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,855
my husband, Marvin, is wealthy,

170
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:14,191
and we can more than provide for Max.

171
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,987
I appreciate that, but per Texas
state law, without a written will

172
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,739
next of kin retains custody.

173
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,950
Charles Kenton, who is aware
of this custody hearing,

174
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,619
and we are expecting him...

175
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,288
[Charlie] No, I need a new robot now.

176
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,624
I had a big fight
for Ambush next Saturday.

177
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,292
I got to show up with something.

178
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,544
Noisy Boy is for sale?

179
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,214
In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.
How much?

180
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,550
That's a good deal.
What's wrong with him?

181
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,636
I can live with that.

182
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,180
Well, I don't have it have it.

183
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:47,058
Charles Kenton waived all
of his rights to custody

184
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:51,062
right after the boy was born.
I can more than provide for Max.

185
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,272
Whoa.

186
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,690
Please be Charles Kenton.

187
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,402
Uh... Charlie, yeah.

188
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,489
[stammers] I'm here to sign some paper

189
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:04,950
that releases my rights
to the custody of my son.

190
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,036
That's why I'm here.
Do I need to be here?

191
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,455
Charlie.

192
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,166
Do you even remember me?

193
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,877
- Debra, Caroline's sister.
- Yeah, sure, Debra. How are you?

194
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,045
- Mr. Kenton.
- Yeah.

195
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,254
Please take a seat.

196
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,510
Your Honor, may I please go
and see my nephew now?

197
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,011
Yes, you may.

198
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,389
- How about you, Mr. Kenton?
- What?

199
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,557
You can spend some time with him,
if you'd like.

200
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,351
- With the kid?
- [Debra] Yeah, the kid.

201
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,311
- Max. Your son?
- All right, all right.

202
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,231
You've been working with those robots
for so long, you've become one.

203
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,651
Honey, you wait right here.
I'm going to be back.

204
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,445
You take all the time you need,
sweetheart.

205
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,079
Your Honor,
I'd like to, at this juncture,

206
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,957
step out and call my attorney,
if that's all right.

207
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,417
[judge] Please.

208
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,548
Come on. Come on.

209
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,591
There you are.

210
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,177
He'll be in a foster home.

211
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,180
No, they find good families.

212
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,015
Young, energetic. Yeah.

213
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,228
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.

214
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,563
- [phone beeps]
- Oh, hey.

215
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,690
Hey, um...

216
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,901
- Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband.
- Right, yeah.

217
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,863
You know,
Debra really wants to adopt Max.

218
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,449
And...

219
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,618
- I'm up for it, but...
- Seventy-five grand.

220
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:31,746
$75,000?

221
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:35,124
- You're serious?
- Mm-hmm.

222
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,461
The thing is...

223
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,088
...we're supposed to go
to Italy this summer

224
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,925
with my oldest friend and his wife.
Two months in Tuscany and all over.

225
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,594
Just the four of you. Sounds nice.

226
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,972
We'll be back in New York
by the end of August.

227
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,267
In August. A hundred.

228
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,352
- $100,000?
- You heard me.

229
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,772
- You're crazy.
- Not nearly as crazy as your wife

230
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,192
if you tell her I just signed
over that kid to the state of Texas.

231
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,987
The way I see it, there's a real way
everyone gets what they want here.

232
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,281
So here's what you're going to do.

233
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,326
You're going to tell your wife
I'll only sign over custody to her

234
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,787
if I get to spend the summer
with the kid first.

235
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,372
Just tell her how guilty
she made me feel

236
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,543
for being such a terrible absentee dad
how I want to make good with junior,

237
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,712
a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.

238
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,175
She'll buy it, you get to be the hero,
and everybody wins.

239
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,890
OK. But not a word about the money
to Debra, you understand?

240
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,267
I understand.

241
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,812
I'll give you 50 grand tonight
when we drop off Max

242
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,980
and the other 50
when we get back in August

243
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,233
and you deliver him to us in New York.

244
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,610
Pleasure doing business with you.

245
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,698
Your Honor, I'm really happy
we all took the time

246
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,408
to make the best decision for everyone.

247
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,330
- Happy?
- [Charlie] Yeah, it's me.

248
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,500
I'm buying Noisy Boy.
I got the money.

249
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,837
Take him to Tallet's Gym
and I'll meet you there.

250
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,644
Hello?

251
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,272
Bailey?

252
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,065
Some guy is here
with the robot you're buying,

253
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,358
and I gotta tell ya, Charlie,

254
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,278
- it smells like disaster to me.
- Nice to see you, too, Bailey.

255
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,406
- Might I also say how cute you look.
- Give it up, Charlie.

256
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:32,491
God, I need a shower.
You want to take a shower?

257
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,536
- Come on.
- Let me make something clear.

258
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,539
A creepy dude with a robot in a box

259
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,083
has been sitting outside my gym
for two hours.

260
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,377
Now, putting aside the fact
that you're doing

261
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,130
what I'm guessing is a black market deal
on my doorstep,

262
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,215
how are you gonna pay him
when Ambush just got destroyed?

263
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,551
The money is on its way.
Just, you know, distract him.

264
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,595
- I have been. It's exhausting.
- You're the best.

265
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,846
- Yeah? Really?
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,973
Is that why
you're buying a $45,000 robot

267
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,141
when you owe me six grand in rent?

268
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,267
- Because I'm the best?
- Three.

269
00:16:58,435 --> 00:16:59,560
- No, six.
- Whoa.

270
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:03,689
No, listen, Charlie. There is a guy with
real money who wants to buy this place.

271
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,025
Come on, like you're really
going to sell your dad's gym.

272
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,776
If you don't make rent,
I can't make payments

273
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,278
and I won't have a choice.

274
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,947
Your father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass if you sold this place.

275
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:15,075
My father would climb out of his grave
and kick your ass.

276
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,243
[sighs]

277
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,580
Bailey.

278
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,502
- Don't.
- Don't what?

279
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,296
Don't do that. Don't... that...

280
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,089
Hey.

281
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,216
- Don't what?
- Don't do that thing.

282
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,679
- No, you like that thing.
- No.

283
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,973
- Yeah.
- No, I don't like that thing.

284
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,059
I used to. Once. Briefly.

285
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,061
Now I like money more.

286
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:45,939
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

287
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,566
[clears throat]

288
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,610
Marvin.

289
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:51,904
Your money has arrived.

290
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,908
Marv.

291
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,873
Fifty grand, as promised.

292
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,001
- Now, here are all our numbers
- Right.

293
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,462
- and contact info over in Europe.
- All right.

294
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,047
So that's everything there.

295
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,095
So Marvin tells me you want
this time with Max.

296
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,472
- Yeah, yeah.
- You did the right thing

297
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,141
giving me custody. I think
Caroline would have wanted that.

298
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,768
Yeah.

299
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,270
Now, have him back in New York
on August 27th.

300
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,648
That's a deal.

301
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,818
- OK, well, let's go get Max.
- OK.

302
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,654
OK? Let's get Max.

303
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:39,284
It's OK. You want me to go on the
other side here and I'll get Max?

304
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,871
Hey, Max.

305
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,249
See you, pal.

306
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,960
[Debra] Max, we'll see you
at the end of the summer, honey.

307
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,138
I'm Charlie.

308
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,853
It's been a long time.
You know, I'm your...

309
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,063
- You screwed me.
- Nice mouth.

310
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,273
Do you know where they're going?

311
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,442
- Italy?
- Yeah, Italy.

312
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,652
- So how did I get stuck here with you?
- Relax, kid.

313
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,113
You got a whole life
of fine living ahead of you.

314
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,908
Charlie, dude's pissed.
He's going to take off.

315
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,327
- Yeah, OK.
- Did Marvin give you that money?

316
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,789
Here, just close the deal.
I'll be right there, OK?

317
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,667
- OK?
- Hey.

318
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,127
Hey.

319
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,046
- I'm Bailey.
- Max.

320
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:36,258
Max Kenton.

321
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,261
- Wow, OK, so this is your...
- Yeah, it's him.

322
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,555
Don't worry about it, OK?

323
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:42,973
I'm standing here looking at you two...

324
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,185
Just go and put Noisy in the shop,
please? Thank you.

325
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,981
[sighs]

326
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,568
So listen, you're going to stay here
with her while I'm on the road.

327
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,986
How much did he give you, huh?

328
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,030
You're coming
at this the wrong way, kid.

329
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,323
No, tell me. I want to know.

330
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,868
50,000. OK?

331
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,162
He gave me $50,000
to sign you over to her.

332
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,247
Will you shut up now?

333
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,624
You sold me?

334
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,376
Sounds worse than it is.

335
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,171
- Really.
- It's just to take care of you.

336
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,256
Give me half the money
and you won't have to.

337
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,259
- Where are you going to go?
- Give me the money. I'll be fine.

338
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,011
I told your aunt I'll get you
to New York at the end of the summer.

339
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,721
Now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?

340
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,099
You sold me for 50 grand.
You owe me half!

341
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,143
I don't have it!
I spent the money on a robot.

342
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:30,521
It's gone! OK? Gone!

343
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,314
I'm through here.

344
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,990
All right, what do we got?

345
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,202
Noisy Boy has arrived.

346
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,080
That's a lot of airline stickers
and customs tags.

347
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,500
- Yep, he's been all over the world.
- London, Japan, Brazil, São Paulo...

348
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:54,253
Hasn't seen North American soil
in over two years.

349
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,755
Maybe that's why you got such
a good price, genius.

350
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:02,010
[Charlie] Decided to stay, huh?

351
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,304
This is Bailey. She'll be looking
after you for a few weeks.

352
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,389
- What?
- By the way,

353
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,975
I need you to look after the kid
for a few weeks or, like, eight.

354
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:12,187
- I want half that money.
- Are we back to this again?

355
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,565
Is there a real robot boxer in there?

356
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,275
Noisy Boy's in there.
Have you ever heard of him?

357
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:20,445
Of course. He fought Rubicon
for the WRB belt in 2016.

358
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,198
- [chuckles]
- [beeps]

359
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,453
Holy crap, he looks amazing.

360
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,332
Well, his composite armor
has been replaced.

361
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,959
Let's see if the insides look as good.

362
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,796
I've watched that fight
with Rubicon like 20 times.

363
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,840
He should have had him
in the third round

364
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,843
but Rubicon got lucky
with a huge right and ended it.

365
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:45,971
[beeping]

366
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,025
[Charlie] Relax, kid. he's on our side.

367
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,736
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.

368
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,446
You know he
has voice recognition, right?

369
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,448
- No, he doesn't.
- He didn't in the League.

370
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,491
When Noisy fought in Brazil,
they must have put it in.

371
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,286
Brazilians are crazy about
that talk-to-your-robot crap.

372
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,874
Right, left, uppercut!

373
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:21,006
Doesn't work.
Right, left, uppercut!

374
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:23,383
I knew that price was too good
to be true. We got screwed.

375
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:24,801
Give me a second.
Let me see if I can fix it.

376
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,762
God, look how good he looks, too.

377
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,347
Give me two seconds.
Let me look at something!

378
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,765
Why didn't you ask the guy
to have a look at it?

379
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:31,099
Relax!

380
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,267
[speaks Japanese]

381
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,272
Whoa, whoa.
What was that? Was that Japanese?

382
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,733
[speaks Japanese]

383
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,404
Let me see if I can reset him
to English. Hang on.

384
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,407
- How the hell do you know Japanese?
- Video games.

385
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,160
[Charlie] You play video games
in Japanese?

386
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,079
Japanese bootlegs are always better.

387
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,129
- Give me that.
- OK, so he's reset to English,

388
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,340
and I found his command matrix.

389
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:05,008
They have pre-loaded a bunch
of combinations.

390
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:08,345
- They should be listed here.
- Right.

391
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,973
Uh... Top salvo!

392
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,268
- [laughing]
- What did I tell you?

393
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,271
Gravity One Downtown!

394

[chuckling]
I was due for some good luck!

395
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,321
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

396
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,366
Bailey, help me put him in the truck.
I am going to go and get your money.

397
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,173
- Give me the keys.
- I'm coming with you.

398
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,842
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

399
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,802
Because I don't want you with me, OK?

400
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,764
I'm either coming with you, or you're
fishing for your keys in the sewer.

401
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,018
Your choice.
What's it going to be, old man?

402
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,394
[jingles]

403
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:01,148
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?

404
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,274
Don't do that again.

405
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:05,027
- Don't, don't, don't.
- That's scaring you, isn't it?

406
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:08,030
- Don't do this again? Whoa, whoa!
- Get in. Just get in, will ya?

407
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,197
Give me the keys first.

408
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,699
No, you can wait
till I get in the truck.

409
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,993
Thanks, Big Pops.

410
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,000
[Max] Sweet ride.

411
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,169

and don't talk.

All right, all right.

- Hey, Finn.

420
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:25,816
- Is that Noisy Boy?
- The one and only.

- That's Noisy Boy!
- [cheering]

422
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:34,825
Noisy's been in Japan.
Softer bots over there.

423
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,243
You sure you want
to fight him tonight?

424
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,496
What do you got, Finn? He can take any
bot in this place. You know it.

[laughs] You can have

- Come on, man.

A thousand
every round your bot survives.

00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:13,752
Scimitar right!

467
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,673
Did you see that?

468
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,801
Easy money, easy money all night.
All night long!

469
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:25,096
Come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!

470
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:27,390
Skull salvo! Firefight!

471
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,896
- Yeah! Go, Noisy!
- Undercard, huh?

00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,863
Get in there. Shogun Trinity!

Let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!

475
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,705
This son-of-a-bitch is crazy!

476
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:51,998
Get up!

477
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,418
Full Metal Feud! Bring it!

478
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,548
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!

479
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:03,259
I got something for you.

480
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,556
Don't you run from me!
You can't run from me!

481
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,642
Get up!

482
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,271
That's illegal!

483
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,273
This is the underworld, kid.
There are no rules!

484
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,692
[Finn] Now we're seeing
the Midas touch.

485
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,069
No. Hands up!

486
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:24,322
Get back in that corner, bitch,
and take this whooping like a man!

487
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,786
He's getting killed in there!

488
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:36,584
It's a headset! You talk into it
and you tell him what to do!

00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,169
Panic Shield!

490
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,172
That's it. One-Two Overlord!

[grunting]

492
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,595
No, no. Shatter Punch!

- Five Recall!
- Get some!

494
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,649
Jeez, damn it.

00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,192
Jab, jab!

496
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,285
Right roundhouse! Roundhouse!

497
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:13,163
[Finn] Did he just spit
his juice in Midas's face?

498
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,832
No, you did not spit in Midas's face!

499
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,752
- It's party time now, Crash Palace!
- Use your left!

500
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,922
[Finn] Noisy's trying to do something
with his one arm!

501
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,717
But Midas pins him,
and Daddy goes to work!

502
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,600
No, no, no! Get up!

503
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:36,144
Get some!

He's got...
Just gotta get to the bell.

00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,106
Move! Get out of the corner!

[crowd chanting] Midas! Midas! Midas!

507
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,865
Somebody's ready
to serve up a decappuccino!

508
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:51,951
I got something for you!
You ready?

509
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:56,414
[Finn] Good night!
That's a home run for Midas.

510
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:59,626
And so long to Noisy Boy.

511
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,222
[screaming]

512
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:15,808
[crowd chanting] Midas! Midas! Midas!

513
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,577
Well, that sucked. You hungry?

514
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:36,955
I saved what's left
of Noisy's voice recognition board.

515
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,958
Other than that, he's trash.
I got to get a new robot together.

516
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,545
I need to find a mainframe. What?

517
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,547
- I hate hamburgers.
- What kid hates burgers?

518
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,215
Fine, more for me.

519
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,925
Here, drink this.

520
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:50,677
You never should have taken that fight.

521
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,555
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.

522
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,474
Do you even think about the stuff you do
before you do it?

523
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,726
You had no idea how to fight that fight.

524
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:02,397
Those combination codes, you didn't
know what half of them even meant.

525
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:04,816
You threw them in there cocky
and half-assed.

526
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,734
Of course he lost.
You never gave him a chance.

527
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,487
- He wasn't that good.
- Noisy Boy was a great robot.

528
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,407
Was. Was a great robot back
in the League, back in the day.

529
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:14,117
But look around you, kid. This place...

530
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,536
This place is where once great robots
go to die.

531
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:19,289
So throw him away.
That's what you do, right?

532
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,332
Anything you don't need
you just throw away.

533
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,378
Wow.

534
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:28,006
It's been a long night.

535
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,134
If you want to sleep indoors tonight,
shut up and get in the truck.

536
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:33,886
Don't look at me like that way.
Get in the truck!

537
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:04,292
Well, they gave me 400 for his head.

538
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,479
You stay put.
I'm going to go look for some parts.

539
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:26,230
- I'm coming with you.
- Huh?

540
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:27,774
That drink has my heart pounding.

541
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,109
If I sit in this truck by myself,
my head will explode.

542
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,736
Whatever. Just keep up.

543
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:41,954
[thunder crashing]

544
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,248
Crap.

545
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:45,625
Stay back, stay back, stay back.

546
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,847
All right, keep up.

547
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:01,974
These searchlights are automated,

548
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,435
but you got to time them right,
so stay close.

549
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:07,021
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

550
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,941
Keep up. It's all right.

551
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:12,610
All right. Come on, come on.

552
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,238
- We're going to get caught.
- Come on.

553
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,908
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

554
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:23,037
Quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!

555
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,209
Robots are on the east side.
We got to be quick in here.

556
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:32,213
Once we're through here,
there's no more searchlights.

557
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,173
Quick! Go, go, go!

558
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,316
- Here it is.
- What are we looking for?

559
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,236
Anything. Anything I could use
to put a fighting bot together.

560
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:56,654
- Hey, look.
- What?

561
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,409
It's so small.

562
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:04,620
Yeah. That's before your time.
That's a Generation One,

563
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,832
the very first fighting bot.
They wanted them to look like us.

564
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,917
The more human, the better.

565
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,628
Crazy how quick everything changed.
Here, put that in the cart.

566
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,005
What changed?

567
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,048
A good question.
Boxing, human boxing.

568
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,009
- It just faded.
- Why?

569
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,303
Because the money moved on.

570
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:22,972
People wanted more carnage,
more show.

571
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,349
You had the whole Brazilian
underground,

572
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,352
the Gracies, the Machados,
jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai,

573
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,564
and 1,000 styles in between.
Full-on ground-and-pound.

574
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:32,857
- Look at this.
- What's that?

575
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,818
- I don't know.
- Not bad. Good spot, kid.

576
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:39,113
You still had human fighters,
human bodies

577
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,449
so you couldn't
give the people what they really wanted:

578
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:44,786
true, no-holds-barred violence.

579
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,664
So the next logical step:

580
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:51,876
get the humans out of there
and let the machines kill each other.

581
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,087
Do you miss it?

582
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,467
- Boxing. Do you miss it?
- Careful.

583
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,135
What? I want to know.

584
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:02,970
Careful, you're on a cliff.

585
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,099
Whoa!

586
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:10,603
That's a long way down.
If you fell, you'd definitely...

Wait! Just easy, easy.
Give me your hand. Nice and easy.

Very slowly. Good. OK, don't look down.

Look at me. Look at me.
That's it! I've got you, Max!

You don't have to be scared. I got you!

- It's so far!
- It's OK. I got you.

Give me your other hand.
Nice and slow.

601
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,966
Just give me your other hand
very slowly.

602
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:24,260
Reach back. Come on. Reach!

603
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,471
All right, look at me.
We're going to do this together.

604
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,390
You and me.
Just look at me.

605

623
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:37,083
Could you just bring the cart to the
edge? I'll use the winch to get him out.

624
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,795
You want that piece of junk? You get
the cart yourself. I'm through here.

625
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:41,772
[wheels whirring]

626
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,902
This is what's left of Noisy Boy?

627
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,196
That's it.
His head does make a nice addition

628
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,032
to the front of the Crash Palace.

629
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,743
- [scoffs] It's not funny.
- Let's get a robot, you and me.

630
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:39,038
Yeah, good idea. You're broke.
I'm almost there myself.

631
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:41,749
- You destroyed the best shot you had.
- We'll put one together.

632
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:44,001
You're brilliant at this.
There's good stuff here.

633
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,711
- No, there's nothing here.
- There is. Look.

634
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:50,257
Charlie, all your junk is... it's junk.

635
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,843
You're not even
in the game anymore, Charlie.

636
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,929
- It's all garbage.
- I heard you. It's garbage.

637
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,847
Don't get loud with me.

638
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,141
- You're your problem, Charlie.
- What's that supposed to mean?

639
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:03,354
I have been here for you a long time.
In the ring, out of the ring,

640
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:05,606
and the whole ugly spiral down,
and I'm tired.

641
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:09,193
My father invested everything
he had in your fight career.

642
00:42:09,361 --> 00:42:10,653
We loved...

643
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:16,784
He loved you like family.
And this is his home.

644
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:19,620
I'm just trying not to let it die.
That's my plan.

645
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,331
What's yours?

646
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,376
[sighs]

647
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,636
You're done, right?

648
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:36,971
You're finally done?

649
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:40,558
Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.

650
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,227
I got nothing left.

651
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,313
All right.

652
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:51,402
Maybe there's something here.

653
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,946
This robot the kid brought
in last night.

654
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:55,781
Would you look at it for me?

655
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:57,449
Please?

656
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,161
Bailey?

657
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:08,127
I've never seen
anything like it before.

658
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:10,296
He's Generation Two, but barely.

659
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,423
I found a power cell that fits him,

660
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:15,843
and I hooked him up
to this old G-2 remote that I had, so...

661
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,970
You can at least move him around,
Charlie, but he's crap.

662
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:20,973
Maybe I can get a sparring gig for him,
make a few hundred bucks.

663
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:24,101
- Charlie, stop.
- [Max] It's my robot!

664
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:27,313
It took me half the night
dragging him out of there.

665
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,064
- He's mine.
- He's yours? Yeah.

666
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,692
But the parts we're
putting in him are mine!

667
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:36,447
You idiots should see if he powers up
before you start fighting over him.

668
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:37,865
What happened to you?

669
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,412
Hey.

670
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,997
[beeping]

[electronic whirring]

673
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,467
Whoa. Whoa.

674
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,344
Watch out. Stay back.

675
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:19,782
Looks like he's got a shadow function.
That's pretty rare.

676
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,910
He can mime your movements
and store them in memory, Max.

677
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:25,245
[Charlie] You think there's
anything here we could use?

678
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,247
- [Bailey] Not much.
- There's a bucket...

679
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:30,417
There's a bucket
I use to wash the truck sometimes.

680
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,462
Use it and clean him up.
He smells like crap.

681
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,548
Wash yourself off, too,
while you're at it. You stink.

682
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:40,260
I switched him to remote.
It's pretty basic.

683
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,972
Just use the toggles here
to steer him and walk him.

684
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,891
- You play video games, right?
- Of course.

685
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,852
Same idea, only this one's
a thousand-pound robot.

686
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:50,562
Cool.

687
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,306
"Atom."

688
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:36,942
[Max] His name is Atom.
Can we get him a fight?

689
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,694
I don't think he
was ever a boxing robot.

690
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:42,614
He's a G-2, built in early 2014.
He was a sparring bot.

691
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,283
They must have built robots
like this one

692
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:46,285
that could mirror the fighting style
of any other robot.

693
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:48,704
OK, so can we get him a fight?

694
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:51,206
Are you not listening?
He's a sparring bot.

695
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:54,084
Built to take a lot of hits, but never
dishing out any real punishment.

696
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,836
You could always sell him off for parts.

697
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:57,296
Can't you get him a fight?

698
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:59,506
"Why can't you get him a fight?
Get him a fight."

699
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,467
God, you don't quit, do you?

700
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,470
You want me to put him in some
bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?

701
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,389
I saw how scared you were
at Crash Palace.

702
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:09,850
The places that would
let you fight this robot

703
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:11,727
would make you pee your little pants.

704
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:14,313
Excellent. Get him a fight.

705
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,358
[mechanical chirping]

706
00:46:20,403 --> 00:46:21,361
Stubborn kid.

707
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,489
Surprise, surprise.

00:47:29,264 --> 00:47:31,473
[Atom whirrs]

714
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:17,394
Can you understand me?

715
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:28,530
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

716

[whirrs]

717
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:56,016
[Max] You've known Charlie a long time.

718
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:59,519
Too long.
We both kind of grew up in this gym.

719
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,814
My dad, he trained him.

720
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,652
That's them. That's Charlie.

721
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:10,989
- [Max] What was he like?
- [Bailey] As a boxer?

722
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,491
As anything.

723
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:17,287
He was something.
He was lean, tough.

724
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,289
No quit, no fear.

725
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:26,546
Come here.
I want to show you something.

726
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,677
I have this newspaper article
from Phoenix 2007

727
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:35,430
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy,
the top contender.

728
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:38,392
- You were at the Nico Tandy fight?
- I was.

729
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,228
Charlie was just supposed
to be a warm-up fight, an easy win.

730
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:45,023
Nico wasn't
even supposed to break a sweat

731
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:50,278
but nobody told Charlie that, so he just
kept coming and coming at him.

732
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:51,780
Check this out.

733
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,493
[Bailey] That's Charlie.

734
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:59,371
First, Nico couldn't believe the balls

735
00:49:59,706 --> 00:50:00,747
on this nobody.

736
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:05,127
But Charlie kept coming,
and that's when Nico looked scared.

737
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,129
- Really?
- Really.

738
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,047
He was toying with Nico.

739
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,092
The top contender,
number two in the world

740
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,554
and Charlie was dancing with him.
Pop! Pop! Bam! Pop!

741
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:18,765
Charlie was floating inches
off the canvas that night.

742
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,768
He was like a ghost.
Nico couldn't even see him.

743
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,062
I could.

744
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:31,028
He was beautiful.

745
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:36,533
So what happened?
Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?

746
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:40,495
No, Nico Tandy put me on my ass
in the 12th round. Twice.

747
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,330
Second time for good. Lights out.

748
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:44,583
You were ahead on the scorecards
going into the 12th round.

749
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,627
Nico Tandy rung my bell
and went on to be the undefeated

750
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,129
world champ for the next three years.

751
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:52,007
- So he knocked you out?
- Yeah, so did a lot of guys.

752
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:53,341
You knocked a lot of guys out, too.

753
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,385
24 and 19.
It's not exactly a career.

754
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,012
But every fight a knockout.

755
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,056
- Yeah.
- Win or lose, fight's not over

756
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,515
- till someone's on the mat.
- Till someone's on the mat.

757
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,185
- Your old man taught me that.
- Damn straight he taught you that.

758
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:05,604
- [Max] Who else did you fight?
- Go get your stuff together.

759
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:07,647
I don't need to.
Did you fight for the title?

760
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:11,068
Yeah, you do.
We leave in an hour. Go.

761
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,570
Wow. Here.

762
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,323
Keep it.

763
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,202
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

764
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:26,583
I like that kid.

765
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:28,835
He likes you.

766
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:37,302
- What I said yesterday was...
- No, nothing more to say.

767
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,140
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight
to see if I can get a partner

768
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:43,934
or raise money to get a new bot.

769
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:49,022
That's what you wanted, right?
Me gone?

770
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:55,529
Yeah, that's what I wanted.

771
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,038
OK.

- OK.

You're very kind,

the mind behind Zeus

798
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:57,275
belongs to the great Tak Mashido.

801
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:04,199
and arguably the most
important bot designer

in the history of the sport
out of retirement?

Is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?

806
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,635
Zeus is autonomous and constantly
evolving during a fight.

807
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:27,847
With his adaptive operating system
he recognizes patterns

808
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:32,185
and rewrites his fight code
instantaneously.

809
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:35,689
For myself and Joe Sixpack out there,
are you saying that Zeus...

810
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:40,694
I'm saying that no matter
what happens in that ring,

811
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:44,281
the result of any fight is inevitable.

812
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,992
What Zeus sees...

813
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:49,828
...he kills.

814
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:52,956

Finn. C'mon.

You got that old bot truck out there.

00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:29,034
- You always got something in there.
- I got an old G-2 sparring bot,

821
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:32,162
ain't worth the paint left on it.
What am I supposed to do with that?

The Zoo. Take him to the Zoo.
They fight there tomorrow.

823

Even I wouldn't be caught dead
at the Zoo.

824
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:39,878
I just need a little loan. Something...

00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,466
- You're serious, Charlie?
- A loan.

Something. A couple hundred. Few
hundred. Whatever you got.

That's what's left of Axelrod.

Where you been?
I told you to stay put.

You should have seen him.
Zeus was, like, amazing!

00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:30,261
- Amazing, huh?
- Unbelievable, yeah.

840
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,431
He was just peppering Axelrod
with punches, but so fast.

841
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,226
It was incredible.
Axelrod didn't even land a punch.

842
00:56:36,394 --> 00:56:38,061
He didn't even survive the first round.

843
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:39,479
Is that what you think boxing is?

844
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,731
Zeus beating up some piece
of steel that they feed him?

845
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:44,651
Axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
And that is what boxing is now.

846
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,404
Deal with it.
And I love it, and I'm in it now.

You're in it now, are you?
You and your G-2 sparring bot?

He's more than that. And if you'd
just get us a fight, you'd see.

There's a lovely place called the Zoo.

Let's just say he does.
