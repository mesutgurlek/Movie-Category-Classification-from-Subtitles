Okay, Yuri,
listen to me, all right?
We're almost done.

528
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,019
As soon as we get that key,
we're gonna grab the file,

529
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:46,022

out of Russia, all right?

530

It means "tough,"
"hard."

In America, it means
"juvenile delinquent."

most of the time,
when you're a cop.

working all the time
was a good thing, you know?

at all.
