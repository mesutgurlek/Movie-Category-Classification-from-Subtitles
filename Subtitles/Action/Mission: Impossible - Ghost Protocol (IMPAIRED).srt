Until a new question
crossed my mind.

What happens after

IMF now believes
this man,

531
00:48:43,302 --> 00:48:47,439
Kurt Hendricks, is the nuclear extremist,
code name Cobalt.

532
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,541
Today he was seen
leaving the Kremlin,

533
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:52,043
with what is likely
a nuclear launch device.

534
00:48:54,614 --> 00:48:57,516
Two days ago,
Sabine Moreau killed one of our agents in Budapest

00:48:57,584 --> 00:49:00,285
and relieved him of Russian nuclear launch codes.

the Burj Hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.

Marius Wistrom is a known
operative of Cobalt.

538
00:49:08,661 --> 00:49:10,812
Wistrom is currently
en route to Dubai.

539
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,633
For the launch device to work,
Cobalt needs the activation codes.

540
00:49:14,684 --> 00:49:17,519
He's sending Wistrom
to buy them from Moreau.

No satellite, safe house, support,

The four of us and the contents of this car

547
00:49:40,693 --> 00:49:43,361
are all that remain
of the IMF.

Our mission
is Hendricks.

551
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,204
We're all that stands
between him and his goal.

Nothing can be
left to chance.

Everyone connected
with this man

is considered an asset with valuable
information about our target.

555

No one can know
we're still on line.

556
00:50:17,563 --> 00:50:19,898
We lose Hendricks now,
we lose him forever.

557
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:21,816
So, what's the play?

558
00:50:21,884 --> 00:50:24,269
Wistrom will take delivery from Moreau in 36 hours.

559
00:50:24,337 --> 00:50:26,505
Now we cannot let the launch codes leave the hotel,

560
00:50:26,572 --> 00:50:29,474
but we need Wistrom
to lead us to Hendricks.

561
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:31,826
He'll only do that
if he has the codes.

562
00:50:31,894 --> 00:50:33,178
JANE: Or if he thinks
he has them.

563
00:50:33,246 --> 00:50:35,480
Our objective is to
intercept the sale,

564
00:50:35,548 --> 00:50:37,832
replace the authentic
codes with counterfeits

565
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,667
and follow Wistrom
to Hendricks.

566
00:50:39,735 --> 00:50:43,438
Well, that's simple enough.
We snatch the codes, we gin up some fakes.

567
00:50:43,506 --> 00:50:48,343
Jane, you double Moreau,
and sell the codes to Wistrom and Bob's your uncle.

568
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:51,680
And how do you propose we just
snatch the codes from Moreau?

569
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:53,015
We take her out.

570
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,952
Yeah, we take her out.
But, you know, discreetly.

571
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,137
Discreetly?

572
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:01,656
Yeah.

573
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:05,127

BENJI: All right.

576
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:10,699
Or Moreau.

577
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:15,953
She'll answer for Hanaway,
but it has to be when I say.

double Wistrom and Moreau,

583
00:51:58,731 --> 00:52:00,966
how do we keep them
in separate rooms

584
00:52:01,033 --> 00:52:03,835
while having them think that
they're in the same room?

ETHAN: We give
the hotel a facelift.

586
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:08,656
Wistrom will think he's arriving at Moreau's suite,

587
00:52:08,724 --> 00:52:11,159
but, really, he'll be
walking into our decoy room.

588
00:52:11,227 --> 00:52:12,960
Where I'll double Moreau.

but nothing to worry about.

612

We're just going to have to go into

615

I mean, this
would be a cinch

if I could call Youssef
back at headquarters,

617

but Youssef doesn't exist anymore,
and neither do we.

I could hack it, but it would take too long.
Then hardwire in.

so hard to grasp?

1157

about the heat.

1163
01:35:27,586 --> 01:35:30,437
And then there's that.
What heat?

1164
01:35:30,505 --> 01:35:31,739
Well, it's like any
computer, isn't it?

1165
01:35:31,807 --> 01:35:35,009

it's gonna get really hot!

1451
02:00:37,061 --> 02:00:38,344
I'm fine, by the way.

1452
02:00:39,730 --> 02:00:41,480
I mean, I'm not actually
sleeping, per se.

1453
02:00:41,548 --> 02:00:44,350
You know. Cold sweats.
Middle of the night.

1454
02:00:46,003 --> 02:00:48,604
All these people are just happy and smiling

1455
02:00:48,672 --> 02:00:50,439
and they are completely
oblivious to the fact

1456
02:00:50,507 --> 02:00:52,775
that they were
almost vaporized.

1457
02:00:53,677 --> 02:00:55,344
And if it hadn't
been for...

1458
02:00:55,412 --> 02:00:57,113
Dumb luck?

1459
02:00:57,181 --> 02:00:58,414
ETHAN: Was it?

1460
02:00:59,667 --> 02:01:03,086
I mean, look,
we were unprepared, in the dark.

1461
02:01:03,671 --> 02:01:05,004
Disavowed.

1462
02:01:06,206 --> 02:01:08,124
And the only thing
that functioned properly

1463
02:01:08,925 --> 02:01:10,460
on that mission

1464
02:01:11,395 --> 02:01:12,895
was this team.

1465
02:01:14,982 --> 02:01:17,683
I don't know how
we ended up together,

1466
02:01:19,336 --> 02:01:20,770
but I'm glad we did.

1467
02:01:28,245 --> 02:01:29,645
Your missions.

1468
02:01:30,397 --> 02:01:32,264
Choose to accept them.

1469
02:01:37,821 --> 02:01:39,722
Hey, look, I'm in.

1470
02:01:39,790 --> 02:01:41,457
Seriously. It's not
as if any mission

1471
02:01:41,524 --> 02:01:43,826
is gonna be rougher
than the last one, is it?

1472
02:01:43,894 --> 02:01:46,379
(GIGGLES) I mean,
that's just...

1473
02:01:46,446 --> 02:01:48,080
Bomb... Is it?

1474
02:01:49,149 --> 02:01:50,616

1475
02:02:06,450 --> 02:02:08,017
Thanks, Ethan.

1476
02:02:08,084 --> 02:02:09,285
Thank you.

Agent Hunt.

1478
02:02:12,372 --> 02:02:13,839
Agent Carter.

02:02:22,449 --> 02:02:23,382
Brandt.

1480
02:02:27,037 --> 02:02:28,737
I'm not picking up
that phone, Ethan,

1481
02:02:28,805 --> 02:02:31,474
because I don't think
you want me in the field.

1482
02:02:34,411 --> 02:02:36,211
I know your wife
is dead.

1483
02:02:38,381 --> 02:02:40,850
I was there in Croatia.

1484
02:02:42,319 --> 02:02:44,019
I was there
for one reason.

1485
02:02:44,087 --> 02:02:45,054
One.

1486
02:02:45,823 --> 02:02:47,289
And I failed.

1487
02:02:51,829 --> 02:02:54,063
It was my job
to protect her.

1488
02:02:54,131 --> 02:02:55,797
How do you know
she's dead?

1489
02:02:58,968 --> 02:03:00,436
There was a body.

1490
02:03:00,504 --> 02:03:01,954
Did you see it?

1491
02:03:05,442 --> 02:03:07,676
You killed
those Serbians.

1492
02:03:07,744 --> 02:03:08,761
I had to get her back.

1493
02:03:08,829 --> 02:03:10,413
You were sent
to Rankow Prison.

1494
02:03:10,481 --> 02:03:12,181
That was a sacrifice
I was willing to make.

1495
02:03:12,249 --> 02:03:15,217
IMF suspected Hendricks
had people in Rankow.

1496
02:03:17,770 --> 02:03:20,539
And six dead Serbians
was the ideal cover.

1497
02:03:22,275 --> 02:03:24,309
Waste not, want not.

(CHUCKLES)

1500
02:03:41,127 --> 02:03:43,228
The Secretary
never told me.

1501
02:03:46,767 --> 02:03:50,386
I accepted the Rankow Prison
mission on one condition:

1502
02:03:50,454 --> 02:03:52,854
That no one could know
she was still alive.

1503
02:03:54,224 --> 02:03:56,759
But you're telling me.

1504
02:03:58,545 --> 02:03:59,578
(CHUCKLES)

1505
02:04:04,601 --> 02:04:07,770
When did you find out
that I was in Croatia?

1506
02:04:07,837 --> 02:04:10,005
I pulled your file
after India.

1507
02:04:10,673 --> 02:04:11,874
Right.

1508
02:04:13,843 --> 02:04:17,280
So you had to fake
your wife's death.

1509
02:04:17,347 --> 02:04:21,483
As long as we were together,
she could never be safe.

1510
02:04:21,551 --> 02:04:24,369
It wasn't your job
to protect her, Brandt.

1511
02:04:26,874 --> 02:04:28,307
It's mine.

1512
02:04:30,510 --> 02:04:31,410
Okay.

1513
02:04:35,382 --> 02:04:36,649
So we're good.

1514
02:04:37,934 --> 02:04:39,301
We're good.

MAN ON HEADPHONES:
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

1518
02:06:02,902 --> 02:06:06,322
36 hours ago, there was a breach in
our military's communication network.

1519
02:06:06,390 --> 02:06:09,792
Now, an emerging terror
organization known as The Syndicate

1520
02:06:09,860 --> 02:06:13,829
has control of our entire drone fleet.
Their targets: Unknown.

02:06:14,114 --> 02:06:16,615
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it...
