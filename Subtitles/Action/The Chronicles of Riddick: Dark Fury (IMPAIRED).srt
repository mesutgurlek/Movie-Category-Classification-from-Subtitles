Each, at one time,

162
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,708
the most wanted man
or woman in the known universe.

163
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,687
The number oflives ended
at the hands of those...

164
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:48,386
living and breathing
in this room is incalculable.

165
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,394
Ain't what I'd call living.

166
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:56,025
Just the same, I assure you
they are all very much alive.

167
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,401
Each one sustained
in a form of cryo so profound...

168
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,633
that seconds seem weeks...

169
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,643
and to blink an eye is a day's work.

170
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:10,148
The brain, however,
continues to function unimpeded.

171
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,946
The mind continues
to think and feel,

172
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,818
swarming with whatever dark thoughts
it's trapped alone with,

173
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,653
as it will be for hundreds of years.

174
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:24,662
So much more fitting a fate than
dropping them off at the nearest slam.

175
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,757
Here, they are appreciated
for what they truly are,

176
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,736
transformed into objects
on par with their lives'work.

177
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:37,902
And why? Because I gave them the
audience they so desperately desired,

178
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,741
the recognition they bought
with the blood of others.

179
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:46,251
I understood their actions,
stripped free of moral convention.

180
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,754
Don't you see? They're
something greater now, Riddick.

181
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:54,259
Something more than
they ever were before. Art.

182
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,921
Lady, your taste sucks.

183
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,431
I expected as much.

184
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,229
Junner.

185
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,650
You see, Riddick,

186
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,187
there is a fundamental difference
between you and I.

187
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,588
Yeah. You're a psychopath.

188
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:30,151
You don't appreciate art.

189
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,756
But I believe the reason for this
is something very different...

190
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,096
than you or anyone else
might think.

191
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,796
You're an artist.

192
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,102
I've been called
a lot of things in my day.

193
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,108
That ain't one of'em.

194
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,873
You make art, Riddick,
not analyze it.

195
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,111
You shape it with your own hands,
carve it from flesh and bone.

196
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:56,951
But a man like you does not understand
such a thing by being lectured.

197
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,820
You must experience it.

198

200

What do you want?
To watch you work.

201
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:21,308
I've spent the latter half of my life
observing fantastic things...

202
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,316
the work of terrible men,
men such as yourself...

203
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,512
but it's always after the fact...

204
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,523
when the moment of bloody creation
is cold and passed.

205
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,786

I need to see it with my own eyes
as it happens.

So we can escape?

323
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,435
It is over.

324
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,444
We have survived.

325
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,649
[Breathing Heavily]

326
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,312
Back to hell with you,

327
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:27,825
you bloody stinking savage!

328
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,668
Im...

329
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,674
Yeah, we made it.

330
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:51,581
Awfully uncivilized thing
you just did there, Jack.

331
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:08,326
Riddick.
Trouble?

332
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,094
Yes.

333
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,432
It is nothing back there.

334
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,097
What worries me
lies ahead of us.

335
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:19,803
- Jack.
- I am concerned for her, Riddick,

336
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,813
that she'll become...

337
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,576
Like me.

338
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,588
[Beeping]

339
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:43,065
- What is that place?
- That's nowhere.

340
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:48,071
I'm dropping you guys
on New Mecca.

341
00:31:55,847 --> 00:32:00,147
Riddick.
We ain't done, boy.

342
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,278
Not by a long shot.

343
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,592
[Riddick]
Hold your breath.

344
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:18,830
[Junner] There is a man inside this
vessel who is something far worse...

345
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:22,839
than anyone here
has ever encountered.

346
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,004
[Riddick]
Hold your breath.

347
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,479
[Junner]
Should you survive this day,

348
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:34,917
it is one you will remember
for the rest of your life.

349
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:40,185
Do not underestimate
the importance of such a thing.

350
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,988
[Riddick]
Hold your breath.

351
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:49,933
[Rock]

352
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:15,156
[Junner, Echoes]
Fall back. Everyone fall back.

353
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:21,390
[Woman] Here, they are appreciated
for what they truly are,

354
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:26,123
transformed into objects on par
with their lives'work.

355
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:35,132
Because I gave them the audience
they so desperately desired,

356
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:39,834
the recognition they bought
with the blood of others.

357
00:34:40,307 --> 00:34:50,834
