* The sky won't fall forever *

1099
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:18,758
* And though the night seems long *

1100
01:39:18,829 --> 01:39:22,094
* Your tears won't fall *

1101
01:39:22,166 --> 01:39:25,101
* Your tears won't fall *

1102
01:39:25,169 --> 01:39:31,438
* Your tears won't fall *

1103
01:39:31,509 --> 01:39:40,110
* Forever **

1104
01:39:58,302 --> 01:40:03,399
* Drivin' faster in my car *

1105
01:40:06,477 --> 01:40:12,245
* Falling farther
from just what we are *

1106
01:40:14,652 --> 01:40:19,248
* Smoke a cigarette
and lie some more *

1107
01:40:19,323 --> 01:40:22,759
* These conversations kill *

1108
01:40:22,827 --> 01:40:28,595
* Falling faster in my car *

1109
01:40:30,334 --> 01:40:33,098
* Time to take her home *

1110
01:40:33,170 --> 01:40:37,766
* Her dizzy head
is conscience laden *

1111
01:40:37,842 --> 01:40:40,936
* Time to take a ride *

1112
01:40:41,012 --> 01:40:45,608
* lt leaves today
no conversation *

1113
01:40:45,683 --> 01:40:48,618
* Time to take her home *

1114
01:40:48,686 --> 01:40:53,385
* Her dizzy head
is conscience laden *

1115
01:40:53,457 --> 01:40:58,554
* Time to wait too long
to wait too long *

1116
01:40:58,629 --> 01:41:02,395
* Way too long **
