1
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:17,171
M really doesn't mind you earning a little money on the side, Dryden.

2
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,943
She'd just prefer it if it wasn't selling secrets.

3
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:34,850
If the theatrics are supposed to scare me you have the wrong man, Bond.

4
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:40,560
If M was so sure that I was bent she'd have sent a double-0.

5
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,768
Benefits of being section chief...

6
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,342
...l'd know if anyone had been promoted to double-0 status wouldn't I?

7
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:54,136
- Your file shows no kills, and it takes- -
- Two.

8
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:15,394
Shame.
We barely got to know each other.

9
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:24,697
I know where you keep your gun.
I suppose that's something.

10
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:31,924
- True. How did he die?
- Your contact?

11
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:33,808
Not well.

12
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,059
Made you feel it, did he?

13
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,740
Well, you needn't worry.

14
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,867
The second is- -

15
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:38,978
Yes. Considerably.

16
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:36,954
So how do I trust this man that I've never met with my money?

17
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:42,163
You asked for the introduction.
That's all my organization will guarantee.

18
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:27,801
I suppose our friend Mr. White will have told you
that I have provided reliable banking services...

19
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,603
...for many other freedom fighters over the years.

20
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,319
-  Do you believe in God, Mr. Le Chiffre?
-  No.

21
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:44,660
I believe in a reasonable rate of return.
I want no risk in the portfolio.

22
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,919
Agreed.

23
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:49,522
- And I can access it anywhere in the world?
- Yes.

24
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,586
I have the money, so short another million shares of Skyfleet stock.

25
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:16,853
Sir, you must know you're betting against the market.

26
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,219
No one expects this stock to go anywhere but up.

27
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,922
Just do it.

28
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:00,365
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

29
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,563
I wonder if bomb-makers are insured for things like that.

30
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:24,928
He's on the move.
He's on the move, and he's heading straight for me.

31
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,617
Stop touching your ear.

32
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,886
- Sorry?
- Put your hand down.

33
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:39,059
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

34
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:14,619
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct my dear general.

35
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,842
Nothing sinister.

36
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,485
All in.

37
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:31,727
I have two pair,
and you have a 17.4 percent chance of making your straight.

38
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,488
When does Ellipsis expire?

39
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:04,055
- We have less than 36 hours. I can--
- No. No, no.

40
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,792
That's all the time I have anyway.

41
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:13,238
Give our guests five minutes to leave or throw them overboard.

42
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,546
Who the hell do they think they are?

43
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:30,853
I report to the prime minister,
even he's smart enough not to ask me what we do.

44
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:34,753
Have you ever seen such a bunch of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

45
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,658
They don't care what we do, they care what we get photographed doing.

46
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,623
And how the hell could Bond be so stupid?

47
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,699
I give him double-O status and he celebrates by shooting up an embassy!

48
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:46,302
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?

49
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:50,669
In the old days, if an agent did something
embarrassing he'd have the good sense to defect.

50
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,707
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

51
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,687
- You've got a bloody cheek.
- Sorry.

52
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,588
I'll shoot the camera first next time.
Or yourself.

53
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:18,786
You stormed into an embassy.

54
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:23,532
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule of international relationships.

55
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:28,069
And why? So you could kill a nobody.
We wanted to question him, not to kill him.

56
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:32,075
For God's sake.
You're supposed to display some kind of judgment.

57
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:36,445
I did.
I thought one less bomb maker in the world will be a good thing.

58
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,245
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

59
00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:42,475
We're trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed...

60
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:46,517
...and you give us one bomb-maker hardly the big picture,
wouldn't you say?

61
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,956
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.

62
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:54,892
And thanks to your over developed trigger finger,
we have no idea who hired him and why.

63
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:59,198
- And how the hell did you find out where I lived?
- The same way I found out your name.

64
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,239
I thought M was a randomly assigned letter.
I've no idea it stood for--

65
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,809
Utter one more syllable and I'll have you killed.

66
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,207
I knew it was too early to promote you.

67
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:13,884
Well, I understand double-0s have a very short life-expectancy...

68
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,080
...so your mistake will be short-lived.

69
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:27,430
Bond, this may be too much for a blunt instrument to understand...

70
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:30,999
...but arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand in hand.

71
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:36,232
- So you want me to be half monk, half hit-man?
- Any thug can kill.

72
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:41,758
I want you to take your ego out of the equation
and to judge the situation dispassionately.

73
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,708
I have to know I can trust you, and that you know who to trust.

74
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,545
And since I don't know that, I need you out of my sight.

75
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:54,180
Go and stick your head in the sand
somewhere and think about your future.

76
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,260
Because these bastards want your head.

77
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:00,920
And I'm seriously considering feeding you to them.

78
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,264
And Bond...

79
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,272
...don't ever break into my house again.

80
00:25:17,248 --> 00:25:19,148
Ma'am.

81
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,889
Good day, sir, and welcome to the Ocean Club.

82
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,928
Hey. Hey.

83
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,739
Hello.

84
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,274
Are you going to take this or make me wait?

85
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,585
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

86
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:50,031
<i>- Security to car park. Security to car park.
- Absolutely incredible.</i>

87
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,624
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?

88
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:35,272
Yes.
But it's a spur-of-the-moment thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

89
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,672
Okay.

90
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,543
- We have an ocean-view villa.
- Perfect.

91
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,114
Could you do me a favor?
I was here for dinner last night,...

92
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:51,277
...and I parked my car next to a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

93
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,782
And I'm ashamed to say I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know--?

94
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,025
- Mr. Dimitrios.
- Right.

95
00:29:56,661 --> 00:30:01,269
If he hasn't noticed, I'm not sure I'd mention it.
Isn't the type to take bad news well.

96
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,902
But if I felt compelled to find him?

97
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:10,904
- He has a house just up the beach.
- Thank you.

98
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,899
- What?
- He's in the Bahamas.

99
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:17,440
You woke me to share his holiday plans?

100
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:21,970
Well, he's logged into our secure website using your name and password.

101
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:27,447
- Well, how the hell does he know these things?
- Well, I'm doing my best to find out.

102
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:31,686
<i>- Who's he looking at?
- Alex Dimitrios.</i>

103
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,516
That slimy bugger.

104
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,002
Now known associates....

105
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,148
Le Chiffre.

106
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:20,899
- We've had a good night, we've had a few drinks.
- How can I assist you, sir?

107
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,535
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

108
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,376
- Look what just happened.
- Good job, big boy.

109
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:27,605
Yeah.

110
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:36,653
Do you mind if I join?

111
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,084
- Oh, good evening.
- Good evening.  - How are you?

112
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:54,369
- Small blind, big blind.
- I'm in.

113
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,436
Bet's to you.

114
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:04,076
If that was for luck, you're two hours late.

115
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,713
Two hundred to you.

116
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,552
- Bet's to you.
- I heard you.

117
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,957
Five to call.

118
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:22,863
- Action's to you.
- Pair of sevens.

119
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:27,582
- Ace high.
- Check or bet.

120
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,472
- Check.
- And to you.

121
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,408
Five thousand.

122
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,811
Five to call.

123
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:51,225
- Check.
- Check to you, sir.

124
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,024
All in.

125
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,496
No, wait.

126
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,368
Twenty thousand.

127
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,103
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

128
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:07,901
Okay. This is on the table.
That's my car. Wanna bet?

129
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,445
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

130
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,641
Please, no. Give him a chance to win his money back.

131
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,391
All right, show me, gentlemen.

132
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,835
Three kings.

133
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,773
There you go with my night.

134
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,377
Trip aces.

135
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,673
Aces win.

136
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,716
Oh, and the valet ticket.

137
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,491
Thank you.

138
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,160
Sir.

139
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,659
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

140
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,860
No wonder he was in such a foul mood.

141
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,295
My mistake.

142
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:40,064
Can I give you a lift home?

143
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:45,995
That would really send him over the edge.
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

144
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,535
Well, perhaps you're just out of practice.

145
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,317
Perhaps.

146
00:35:57,521 --> 00:35:59,250
Well, what about a drink at my place?

147
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:02,148
Your place?

148
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,426
- Is it close?
- Very.

149
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,701
One drink.

150
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,732
- Good evening, sir, and welcome back.
- Welcome to my home.

151
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:58,239
<i>I'm having a hard time seeing how this is my fault.</i>

152
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:01,111
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

153
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:05,812
A man who was under surveillance by the British Secret Service.

154
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,093
Which makes me wonder if I can trust you at all.

155
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,662
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

156
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,831
But I do care about my reputation.

157
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,230
I have someone else willing to do the job.

158
00:37:18,235 --> 00:37:22,632
He just needs the particulars and payment.

159
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:37,446
You like married women, don't you, James?

160
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,650
It keeps things simple.

161
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,391
What is it about bad men?

162
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:51,565
You, my husband I had so many chances to be happy...

163
00:37:51,635 --> 00:37:54,001
...so many nice guys.

164
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,901
Why can't nice guys be more like you?

165
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,338
Well, because then they'd be bad.

166
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:02,541
Yes.

167
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:08,115
But so much more interesting.

168
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,990
What makes your husband a bad man?

169
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,752
His nature, I suppose.

170
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,623
The nature of his work?

171
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:23,493
A mystery, I'm afraid.

172
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:29,670
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me in order to get to him.

173
00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:32,141
How afraid?

174
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,508
Not enough to stop.

175
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,348
Can I ask you a personal question?

176
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,587
Now would seem an appropriate time.

177
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,161
Does "ellipsis" mean anything to you?

178
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,474
Should I ask him about it?

179
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,007
Perhaps later.

180
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,138
Yes, dear?

181
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:11,446
<i>I'm on the last flight tonight to Miami.</i>

182
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,277
<i>Don't wait up.
I'll be back in the morning.</i>

183
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,617
Okay, I understand.

184
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:19,585
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

185
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:25,728
Apparently he's on the last flight to Miami...

186
00:39:25,729 --> 00:39:29,893
...so you have all night to question me.

187
00:39:32,736 --> 00:39:38,163
In that case we're gonna need some more champagne.

188
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,413
<i>Good evening. Room Service.</i>

189
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:50,896
Good evening.
Can I get a bottle of chilled Bollinger Grand Année and the beluga caviar?

190
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,723
<i>- With everything?
- Yes, with everything.</i>

191
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,017
<i>- And would that be for two, sir?
- What?</i>

192
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:59,291
<i>- For two?
- No, for one.</i>

193
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,125
Wait here.

194
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:41,365
There you go. Number 53.

195
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:50,938
<i>Dr. Von Hagens' Body Worlds invites visitors
to observe the body's various locomotive, digestive...</i>

196
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,711
<i>...nervous and vascular systems.</i>

197
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,911
<i>Please may I have your attention, ladies and gentlemen?</i>

198
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,814
<i>I believe it is something very special, what we see here.</i>

199
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,179
<i>This is edutainment.</i>

200
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,707
<i>--fixed in dramatic and athletic poses...</i>

201
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:35,783
<i>...that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.</i>

202
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,257
Hello.

203
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:53,368
Hello.

204
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,538
<i>Do not leave your vehicle unattended.</i>

205
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,509
<i>Welcome to Miami International Airport.</i>

206
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,847
<i>Curbside parking in front of the terminal is restricted....</i>

207
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,842
- Yes.
- It's Bond. I need her now.

208
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,783
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

209
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,255
Listen, you go and find her,
tell her to call Security at Miami Airport...

210
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,020
...because I think a bomb is about to go off, and you do it now.

211
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:02,158
- Sorry, can I put you on hold?
- I thought you might.

212
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,333
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

213
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,164
I'll call you back.

214
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:38,398
- The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
- What about it?

215
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,733
"The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

216
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:23,970
Oh, my God!

217
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:26,073
<i>Bond? Bond!</i>

218
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:33,078
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.
It's launching today.

219
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,219
I gotta go.

220
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,288
Stop! Stop!

221
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:09,122
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

222
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:47,019
The puts expired.
I'm sorry, I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

223
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:52,627
One hundred and one million, two hundred and six thousand dollars.

224
00:53:58,968 --> 00:54:01,129
Someone talked.

225
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:27,061
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah, I have.

226
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:29,122
I'm gonna get a few more photos....

227
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:46,539
Quite the body count you're stacking up.

228
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:53,180
She was tortured first. As you'd already killed her husband
she must have been the only one left to question.

229
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,916
Did she know anything that could compromise you?

230
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:57,092
No.

231
00:54:57,093 --> 00:55:00,751
- Not your name, what you were after?
- No.

232
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:05,867
Dimitrios worked as a middleman. Always knew where to
put his hands on weapons and people who could use them.

233
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,629
He worked with anyone who had money.

234
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:13,514
For years he was involved with a man we knew as
Le Chiffre a private banker to the world's terrorists.

235
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:17,168
He invested their money and gave them access to it wherever they wanted.

236
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,943
Oh, good. You're here.

237
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,709
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

238
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:26,380
A bit of a mathematical genius and liked to prove it by playing poker.

239
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,242
So you can keep an eye on me?

240
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,078
Yes.

241
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:08,322
<i>When they analyzed the stock market after 9/11...</i>

242
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,830
...the CIA discovered a massive shorting of airline stocks.

243
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,866
<i>When the stocks hit bottom on 9/12, somebody made a fortune.</i>

244
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:20,372
The same thing happened this morning with Skyfleet stock or was supposed to.

245
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:24,543
With their prototype destroyed, the company would be near bankruptcy.

246
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:29,374
Instead, somebody lost over $100 million betting the wrong way.

247
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:31,486
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

248
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:36,523
Which would explain how he could set up a
high-stakes poker game at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

249
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:40,987
Ten players, $10 million buy-in, 5 million re-buy.

250
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:43,961
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

251
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:46,527
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.

252
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,904
Do you want a clean kill, or do you want to send a message?

253
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:53,371
We want him alive.
Le Chiffre doesn't have a 100 million to lose.

254
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:56,977
Has he been playing the stock market with his clients' funds?

255
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,013
They're not gonna be too happy when they find out it's gone.

256
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:03,861
We can't let him win this game.
If he loses, he'll have nowhere to run.

257
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,053
We'll give him sanctuary in return for everything he knows.

258
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:11,885
I'm putting you in the game replacing someone who's playing for a syndicate.

259
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:15,622
According to Villiers, you're the best player in the Service.

260
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:17,663
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

261
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:26,839
I would ask you if you could remain emotionally detached...

262
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:30,206
...but I don't think that's your problem, is it, Bond?

263
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:32,544
No.

264
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:38,984
Don't worry about keeping in touch.
We'll know where you are.

265
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:40,353
You can stop pretending.

266
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:43,449
You knew I wouldn't let this drop, didn't you?

267
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,725
Well, I knew you were you.

268
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:06,976
Thank you.

269
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,355
I'm the money.

270
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,922
Every penny of it.

271
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,957
The Treasury has agreed to stake you in the game.

272
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,495
"Vesper."

273
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:29,394
Well, I do hope you gave your parents hell for that.

274
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,406
Thank you.

275
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:33,269
Your boss must be well-connected.

276
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:36,110
I've never seen so much go out the door so quickly.

277
00:58:36,512 --> 00:58:38,139
Or quite so stylishly.

278
00:58:40,249 --> 00:58:41,682
May I ask you where it is?

279
00:58:41,884 --> 00:58:44,609
Ten million was wired to your account in Montenegro...

280
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:49,155
...with a contingency for 5 more if I deem it a prudent investment.

281
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:52,384
I suppose you've given some thought to the notion that if you lose...

282
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:55,496
...our government will have directly financed terrorism.

283
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:00,067
What looks good?

284
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:10,308
So you're telling me it's a matter of probability and odds.

285
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:12,481
I was worried there was some chance involved.

286
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:15,344
Well, only if you assume the player with the best hand wins.

287
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,785
So that would be what you call "bluffing"?

288
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,454
You've heard the term.

289
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,350
Then you'll also know that in poker you never play your hand.

290
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:26,726
You play the man across from you.

291
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:29,495
- And you're good at reading people?
- Yes, I am.

292
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:33,728
Which is why I've been able to detect
an undercurrent of sarcasm in your voice.

293
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,304
I'm now assured our money is in good hands.

294
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:40,569
You don't think this is a very good plan, do you?

295
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:42,066
So there is a plan?

296
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:47,478
I got the impression we were risking millions of dollars
and hundreds of lives on a game of luck.

297
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,508
What else can you surmise, Mr. Bond?

298
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,880
About you, Miss Lynd?

299
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:53,680
Well, your beauty's a problem.

300
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:56,148
You worry you won't be taken seriously.

301
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:59,551
Which one can say of any attractive woman with half a brain.

302
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:03,360
True, but this one overcompensates by wearing slightly masculine clothing...

303
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:08,602
...being more aggressive than her female colleagues
which gives her a somewhat prickly demeanor...

304
01:00:08,604 --> 01:00:14,337
...and ironically enough, makes it less likely for her to be accepted
and promoted by her male superiors...

305
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:17,508
...who mistake her insecurities for arrogance.

306
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:22,041
Now, I'd have normally gone with only child but,...

307
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:28,015
...you see, by the way you ignored the quip about
your parents I'm gonna have to go with orphan.

308
01:00:30,993 --> 01:00:32,927
All right.

309
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:39,132
By the cut of your suit, you went to Oxford or wherever
and actually think human beings dress like that.

310
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:43,335
But you wear it with such disdain my guess is you didn't come from money...

311
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:46,099
...and your school friends never let you forget it.

312
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:51,313
Which means you were at that school by the grace
of someone else's charity, hence the chip on your shoulder.

313
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:56,015
And since your first thought about me ran to orphan
that's what I'd say you are.

314
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,947
Oh, you are.

315
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:04,256
I like this poker thing.

316
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:09,023
And that makes perfect sense since
MI6 looks for maladjusted young men...

317
01:01:09,031 --> 01:01:13,895
...that give little thought to sacrificing others
in order to protect Queen and country.

318
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:19,345
You know former SAS types with easy smiles and expensive watches.

319
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:22,008
- Rolex?
- Omega.

320
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:24,042
Beautiful.

321
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:29,348
Now, having just met you I wouldn't go
as far as calling you a cold-hearted bastard.

322
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,717
- No, of course not.
- But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine.

323
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:37,383
You think of women as disposable pleasures rather than meaningful pursuits.

324
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:43,828
So as charming as you are, Mr. Bond
I will be keeping my eye on our government's money...

325
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,001
...and off your perfectly formed arse.

326
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:47,793
You noticed?

327
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:49,995
Even accountants have imagination.

328
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,537
How was your lamb?

329
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:53,499
Skewered.

330
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:55,336
One sympathizes.

331
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,880
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

332
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,213
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

333
01:02:16,732 --> 01:02:19,701
- Hotel Splendid, sir?
- That's right.

334
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:24,201
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

335
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,518
It's just last-minute details.

336
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:43,954
Apparently we're very much in love.

337
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,863
Do you usually leave it to porters to tell you this sort of thing?

338
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:50,760
Only when the romance has been necessarily brief.

339
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:55,899
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech, professional gambler
and you're Miss Stephanie Broadchest--

340
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,300
- I am not.
- You're gonna have to trust me on this.

341
01:02:58,307 --> 01:03:00,275
Oh, no, I don't.

342
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:04,776
We've been involved for quite a while hence the shared suite.

343
01:03:04,942 --> 01:03:10,638
But my family is strict Roman Catholic
so for appearances' sake, it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

344
01:03:10,647 --> 01:03:13,912
I do hate it when religion comes between us.

345
01:03:14,017 --> 01:03:16,417
Religion and a securely locked door.

346
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,788
Am I going to have a problem with you, Bond?

347
01:03:18,789 --> 01:03:21,753
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

348
01:03:21,792 --> 01:03:22,884
Smart?

349
01:03:23,494 --> 01:03:25,189
Single.

350
01:03:44,414 --> 01:03:46,805
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

351
01:03:46,817 --> 01:03:49,884
James Bond. You'll find the reservation under Beech.

352
01:03:49,886 --> 01:03:52,816
- Welcome, Mr. Bond.
- You sign that, dear.

353
01:03:53,256 --> 01:03:55,588
You represent the Treasury.

354
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:02,592
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

355
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,391
I will. Thank you.

356
01:04:07,404 --> 01:04:08,564
Very funny.

357
01:04:08,572 --> 01:04:13,202
Look, if Le Chiffre is that well-connected,
he knows who I am and where the money's coming from.

358
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:15,640
Which means he's decided to play me anyway.

359
01:04:15,645 --> 01:04:20,711
So he's either desperate or he's overly confident but either way,
that tells me something about him.

360
01:04:20,717 --> 01:04:23,442
And all he gets in return is a name he already has.

361
01:04:23,553 --> 01:04:27,590
And now he knows something about you.
He knows you're reckless.

362
01:04:28,191 --> 01:04:30,022
Take the next one.

363
01:04:30,227 --> 01:04:33,294
There isn't enough room for me and your ego.

364
01:04:33,497 --> 01:04:35,055
Mr. Bond?

365
01:04:35,265 --> 01:04:37,597
- It was left for you.
- Thank you.

366
01:05:08,732 --> 01:05:10,256
I love you too, M.

367
01:05:49,439 --> 01:05:54,838
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

368
01:05:58,148 --> 01:05:59,706
Does he know we've been watching him?

369
01:05:59,916 --> 01:06:02,578
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

370
01:06:02,786 --> 01:06:07,320
Probably because there's no "we."
Just me.

371
01:06:07,757 --> 01:06:09,925
I'm afraid if you get into trouble here...

372
01:06:09,926 --> 01:06:13,857
...the cavalry won't be coming over the nearest hill.

373
01:06:15,198 --> 01:06:21,195
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday and spent
the time reestablishing old relationships.

374
01:06:21,571 --> 01:06:24,706
The chief of police and he are now quite close.

375
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:26,608
That's him, with the mustache.

376
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:28,368
Over my left shoulder.

377
01:06:29,446 --> 01:06:31,841
Well, that could make life quite difficult.

378
01:06:31,848 --> 01:06:33,816
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

379
01:06:34,017 --> 01:06:36,645
He's not a very subtle man.

380
01:06:36,853 --> 01:06:40,216
I thought about trying to buy his services, but we frankly...

381
01:06:40,223 --> 01:06:43,420
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

382
01:06:51,535 --> 01:06:57,095
I hate to say it
but the accountants seem to be running MI6 these days.

383
01:06:57,941 --> 01:07:01,338
Oh, not that I have anything against accountants.

384
01:07:01,344 --> 01:07:03,608
Many of them are lovely people.

385
01:07:05,148 --> 01:07:08,442
So I decided that it was cheaper to supply his deputy...

386
01:07:08,451 --> 01:07:12,246
...with evidence that we were bribing the chief.

387
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:16,789
It's amazing what you can do with Photoshop these days, isn't it?

388
01:07:19,529 --> 01:07:22,357
I think your odds are improving, Mr. Bond.

389
01:07:27,637 --> 01:07:29,002
Yes?

390
01:07:29,673 --> 01:07:31,334
For you.

391
01:07:32,509 --> 01:07:35,000
Something you expect me to wear?

392
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,811
I need you looking fabulous.

393
01:07:39,015 --> 01:07:43,813
So that when you walk up behind me and kiss me on the neck,
the players across from me will be thinking about your neckline...

394
01:07:43,817 --> 01:07:48,416
...and not about their cards.
Do you think you can do that for me?

395
01:07:48,425 --> 01:07:50,359
I'll do my best.

396
01:07:51,428 --> 01:07:53,362
Thank you.

397
01:08:05,575 --> 01:08:06,803
I have a dinner jacket.

398
01:08:08,011 --> 01:08:10,543
There are dinner jackets and dinner jackets.

399
01:08:10,547 --> 01:08:11,707
This is the latter.

400
01:08:11,915 --> 01:08:15,312
And I need you looking like a man who belongs at that table.

401
01:08:15,552 --> 01:08:17,179
How--?

402
01:08:17,988 --> 01:08:19,455
It's tailored.

403
01:08:19,656 --> 01:08:22,216
I sized you up the moment we met.

404
01:09:15,912 --> 01:09:18,540
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

405
01:09:20,483 --> 01:09:22,144
Thank you.

406
01:09:32,929 --> 01:09:35,256
And you must be Mr. Bliss' replacement.

407
01:09:35,265 --> 01:09:41,248
Welcome, Mr. Beech.
Or is that Bond? I'm a little confused.

408
01:09:41,571 --> 01:09:44,005
Well, we wouldn't want that, would we?

409
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:55,441
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

410
01:09:55,652 --> 01:09:58,446
As you know, the game is no-limit hold 'em poker.

411
01:09:58,455 --> 01:10:00,389
Five communal cards, two in the hole.

412
01:10:00,857 --> 01:10:05,091
Monsieur Mendel here represents the Basel Bank,
Switzerland holding the stakes.

413
01:10:07,364 --> 01:10:10,089
You have each deposited $10 million buy-in.

414
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,201
A further buy-in of 5 million can be made by electronic transfer.

415
01:10:13,203 --> 01:10:18,436
The money will remain in escrow until I return
and the winner of the contest enters his or her password...

416
01:10:18,441 --> 01:10:24,281
...into the encryptor whereupon the entire sum will be
wired to any bank account in the world you nominate.

417
01:10:24,447 --> 01:10:26,176
Mr. Bond?

418
01:10:26,616 --> 01:10:27,976
We proceed alphabetically.

419
01:10:27,984 --> 01:10:30,618
Please be so kind as to enter a password of your choice.

420
01:10:38,828 --> 01:10:40,288
Six letters or more.

421
01:10:53,076 --> 01:10:55,738
High card for dealer position.

422
01:11:02,786 --> 01:11:04,083
It's Signor Gallardo.

423
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:07,513
Mr. Kaminofsky is the small blind, $5000...

424
01:11:07,524 --> 01:11:11,182
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind, $10,000.

425
01:11:13,096 --> 01:11:15,121
Well, enjoy the game.

426
01:11:38,988 --> 01:11:40,080
Four players.

427
01:11:42,692 --> 01:11:44,023
It's your bet.

428
01:11:45,562 --> 01:11:47,029
Check.

429
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:49,027
Check.

430
01:11:53,336 --> 01:11:55,395
Bet. Fifty thousand.

431
01:12:08,618 --> 01:12:09,880
Call.

432
01:12:13,156 --> 01:12:14,418
Fold.

433
01:12:16,626 --> 01:12:19,026
Fold. Heads up.

434
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:24,766
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

435
01:12:36,279 --> 01:12:38,839
Bet. One hundred thousand.

436
01:12:41,951 --> 01:12:45,143
Weren't you supposed to enter so the others could see you?

437
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:48,180
Was I? Forgive me.

438
01:12:48,725 --> 01:12:50,920
Good luck, darling.

439
01:12:54,731 --> 01:12:57,131
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

440
01:12:59,102 --> 01:13:00,296
Monsieur Bond?

441
01:13:00,503 --> 01:13:03,365
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

442
01:13:03,973 --> 01:13:05,702
Call.

443
01:13:10,847 --> 01:13:12,007
Hello.

444
01:13:12,215 --> 01:13:16,010
I suppose I don't have to tell you how beautiful you look.

445
01:13:16,019 --> 01:13:19,347
Half the people at that table are still watching you.

446
01:13:19,355 --> 01:13:20,522
Champagne.

447
01:13:24,027 --> 01:13:25,892
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

448
01:13:36,973 --> 01:13:38,670
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

449
01:13:44,681 --> 01:13:48,947
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

450
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:53,482
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

451
01:13:53,489 --> 01:13:55,286
Mr. Bond?

452
01:13:58,194 --> 01:13:59,525
Fold.

453
01:14:06,903 --> 01:14:09,235
Send the barman over, please.

454
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:20,178
- A dry martini. Wait.
- Oui, monsieur.

455
01:14:20,383 --> 01:14:24,318
Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka,
half a measure of Kina Lillet, shake it over ice,...

456
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,353
- ...and then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
- Yes, sir.

457
01:14:27,357 --> 01:14:30,424
- You know, I'll have one of those.
- So will I.

458
01:14:31,194 --> 01:14:32,422
Certainly.

459
01:14:33,363 --> 01:14:37,465
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

460
01:14:38,134 --> 01:14:39,465
That's it?

461
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:43,942
- Anyone want to play poker now?
- Someone's in a hurry.

462
01:14:52,749 --> 01:14:54,683
Would you excuse me?

463
01:15:08,197 --> 01:15:09,528
You taste nice.

464
01:15:09,732 --> 01:15:12,867
- I thought we dispensed with covers.
- No.

465
01:15:12,869 --> 01:15:16,766
We dispensed with one that was of no use and created another that is.

466
01:15:16,773 --> 01:15:18,497
- Is he watching?
- Yes.

467
01:15:18,508 --> 01:15:19,566
Good.

468
01:15:19,776 --> 01:15:24,540
This is me in character pissed off because
you're losing so fast we won't be here past midnight.

469
01:15:24,714 --> 01:15:27,883
Oddly, my character's feelings mirror my own.

470
01:15:28,317 --> 01:15:29,875
Check.

471
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,551
- You know, that's not half bad.
- Up to you.

472
01:15:32,555 --> 01:15:34,655
I'm gonna have to think up a name for that.

473
01:15:35,992 --> 01:15:38,552
It was worth it to discover his tell.

474
01:15:38,895 --> 01:15:40,157
What do you mean?

475
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:42,755
The twitch he has to hide when he bluffs.

476
01:15:42,765 --> 01:15:47,095
- Bluffs? He had the best hand.
- Which he got on the last card.

477
01:15:47,103 --> 01:15:49,498
The odds against were 23-to-1, and he'd know that.

478
01:15:49,505 --> 01:15:51,673
When he did his first raise he had nothing.

479
01:15:51,674 --> 01:15:53,198
Winning was blind luck.

480
01:15:53,409 --> 01:15:55,240
- Did you get the bug?
- Yes.

481
01:15:55,445 --> 01:15:59,040
- Bet. One hundred thousand.
- Thank you.

482
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:05,583
- It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.
- Maybe he can actually pull this off.

483
01:16:06,355 --> 01:16:07,788
Call.

484
01:16:09,392 --> 01:16:11,360
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

485
01:16:13,896 --> 01:16:18,591
Ladies and gentlemen, Mesdames, Messieurs
we've now been playing for four hours.

486
01:16:18,601 --> 01:16:23,261
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

487
01:16:51,901 --> 01:16:57,869
Well, I think I'll report on the evening's frivolities.

488
01:16:59,275 --> 01:17:01,140
So?

489
01:17:01,344 --> 01:17:03,471
You want to do what to me?

490
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:05,010
You've lost me completely.

491
01:17:05,214 --> 01:17:08,349
You just said you can't wait to get me back to the room. Come on.

492
01:17:32,108 --> 01:17:35,737
So, what's--?
What's so damn important?

493
01:17:38,181 --> 01:17:39,773
I'm sorry.

494
01:17:42,652 --> 01:17:44,610
Where is my money?

495
01:17:48,758 --> 01:17:49,952
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

496
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,389
You're holding a parcel for me.

497
01:17:57,033 --> 01:17:58,694
Thank you.

498
01:17:59,969 --> 01:18:04,333
Do you think you can lose that kind of money and no one would notice?

499
01:18:04,674 --> 01:18:06,471
Your money is safe.

500
01:18:08,277 --> 01:18:10,006
Open that.

501
01:18:26,028 --> 01:18:28,087
You'll have it tomorrow.

502
01:18:29,031 --> 01:18:30,328
All of it.

503
01:18:43,813 --> 01:18:48,072
I would take a hand for this betrayal, but you need it to play cards.

504
01:18:52,321 --> 01:18:54,050
Hold out your arm.

505
01:18:55,324 --> 01:18:59,551
Hold out your arm, my beauty or I will take your head.

506
01:19:09,272 --> 01:19:12,207
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

507
01:19:25,554 --> 01:19:26,721
Stairs.

508
01:19:31,027 --> 01:19:33,655
Not a word of protest.

509
01:19:34,263 --> 01:19:36,823
You should find a new boyfriend.

510
01:21:38,488 --> 01:21:40,183
Go find Mathis.

511
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:44,021
Tell him I've hidden the bodies down here,
and I want him to get rid of them.

512
01:21:44,026 --> 01:21:46,852
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

513
01:22:49,692 --> 01:22:52,286
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

514
01:22:52,629 --> 01:22:56,526
I hope our little game isn't causing you to perspire.

515
01:22:56,532 --> 01:22:57,760
A little.

516
01:22:57,967 --> 01:23:01,728
But I won't consider myself to be in trouble until I start weeping blood.

517
01:23:01,738 --> 01:23:05,965
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's ready, let's continue the game.

518
01:24:07,003 --> 01:24:11,572
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

519
01:24:12,408 --> 01:24:14,273
Here, let's see.

520
01:24:29,859 --> 01:24:31,690
That's better.

521
01:24:35,765 --> 01:24:37,096
You cold?

522
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:38,699
Yeah.

523
01:24:38,901 --> 01:24:40,801
Here.

524
01:25:37,527 --> 01:25:39,791
You have any trouble with the bodies?

525
01:25:40,163 --> 01:25:42,290
Less than some.

526
01:25:56,078 --> 01:26:00,409
Being dead doesn't mean one can't still be helpful.

527
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:03,646
That'll keep Le Chiffre looking over his shoulder.

528
01:26:03,653 --> 01:26:06,083
He'll be wondering who's gonna come for him next.

529
01:26:07,523 --> 01:26:09,753
How's our girl?

530
01:26:10,293 --> 01:26:13,490
Melted your cold heart yet?

531
01:26:31,414 --> 01:26:32,608
Call.

532
01:26:32,815 --> 01:26:34,214
Fold.

533
01:26:34,417 --> 01:26:36,385
And call.

534
01:26:37,687 --> 01:26:39,746
Three players.

535
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:45,122
Three hundred grand.

536
01:26:45,328 --> 01:26:47,389
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

537
01:26:48,865 --> 01:26:50,526
Call.

538
01:26:52,268 --> 01:26:53,935
And call.

539
01:26:58,407 --> 01:26:59,704
Three players.

540
01:27:04,046 --> 01:27:05,235
Check.

541
01:27:10,553 --> 01:27:12,013
Monsieur Bond?

542
01:27:21,597 --> 01:27:24,031
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

543
01:27:35,711 --> 01:27:40,011
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

544
01:27:40,216 --> 01:27:42,841
My God, James was right.

545
01:27:43,352 --> 01:27:45,286
It's up to you.

546
01:27:51,427 --> 01:27:53,827
Raise. One million.

547
01:28:01,103 --> 01:28:03,669
Seems someone knows something I don't.

548
01:28:04,507 --> 01:28:05,701
Fold.

549
01:28:05,908 --> 01:28:07,671
Heads up, gentlemen.

550
01:28:07,877 --> 01:28:09,435
It's up to you.

551
01:28:23,626 --> 01:28:25,093
Two.

552
01:28:25,861 --> 01:28:27,954
Re-raise. Two million.

553
01:28:29,932 --> 01:28:31,991
And it's up to you.

554
01:28:43,078 --> 01:28:44,943
I'm all in.

555
01:28:52,354 --> 01:28:57,260
Well, it's 14 million and 500,000.
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

556
01:28:59,695 --> 01:29:04,264
Bond will have to go all in to call his bluff.

557
01:29:05,001 --> 01:29:07,731
- Call.
- Call.

558
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:10,536
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

559
01:29:12,274 --> 01:29:16,974
Full house. Kings and aces.
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

560
01:29:29,859 --> 01:29:33,756
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

561
01:29:37,566 --> 01:29:40,929
You must have thought I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

562
01:29:41,604 --> 01:29:42,764
Please.

563
01:29:42,772 --> 01:29:48,770
We will now break for one hour.
When we return, the big blind will be 200,000.

564
01:29:56,052 --> 01:29:57,713
Good game.

565
01:30:25,848 --> 01:30:29,381
Well, I'm gonna need the other 5 million to buy back in.

566
01:30:29,752 --> 01:30:32,084
I can't do that, James.

567
01:30:32,621 --> 01:30:35,021
Look, I made a mistake.

568
01:30:35,825 --> 01:30:39,227
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant, but I can beat him.

569
01:30:39,228 --> 01:30:41,161
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

570
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:43,163
Sorry?

571
01:30:43,365 --> 01:30:46,028
Why don't you try putting that in a sentence, like maybe,

572
01:30:46,034 --> 01:30:49,863
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win, continue funding terror
and killing innocent people." That kind of sorry?

573
01:30:49,871 --> 01:30:54,241
You lost because of your ego, and that same ego can't take it.
That's what this is about.

574
01:30:54,343 --> 01:30:58,511
- All you're going to do now is lose more.
- Then you're an idiot.

575
01:30:58,314 --> 01:31:01,381
- I'm sorry?
- I said, you're a bloody idiot.

576
01:31:03,085 --> 01:31:05,349
Look in my eyes.

577
01:31:06,121 --> 01:31:08,484
I can beat this man, you know that.

578
01:31:10,526 --> 01:31:13,120
Get your hand off my arm.

579
01:31:36,018 --> 01:31:37,378
Vodka martini.

580
01:31:37,386 --> 01:31:40,384
- Shaken or stirred?
- Do I look like I give a damn?

581
01:31:58,374 --> 01:32:00,638
- James.
- Get the girl out.

582
01:32:07,916 --> 01:32:12,383
Funny game, right?
Sorry, I should've introduced myself, seeing as we're related.

583
01:32:12,921 --> 01:32:16,415
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

584
01:32:18,026 --> 01:32:19,625
You should have a little faith.

585
01:32:19,628 --> 01:32:22,319
If you keep your head about you, I think you have him.

586
01:32:22,331 --> 01:32:24,595
Had. Excuse me.

587
01:32:25,033 --> 01:32:26,967
You're not buying in?

588
01:32:28,670 --> 01:32:30,035
No.

589
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:37,511
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

590
01:32:37,513 --> 01:32:40,375
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

591
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:43,543
I'm saying I'll give you the money to keep going.

592
01:32:43,552 --> 01:32:48,621
Just one thing.
If you pull it off, the CIA bring him in.

593
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:52,124
And what about the winnings?

594
01:32:52,828 --> 01:32:55,388
Does it look like we need the money?

595
01:33:06,942 --> 01:33:09,035
Shall we up the blinds?

596
01:33:11,246 --> 01:33:12,941
Why not?

597
01:33:16,418 --> 01:33:17,908
Bet.

598
01:33:19,988 --> 01:33:21,649
Raise.

599
01:33:37,172 --> 01:33:39,106
And fold.

600
01:33:41,343 --> 01:33:43,311
Excuse me, please.

601
01:33:45,013 --> 01:33:46,640
Call.

602
01:33:48,116 --> 01:33:49,344
Raise.

603
01:33:49,551 --> 01:33:53,009
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

604
01:33:55,524 --> 01:33:57,458
- Fold.
- Thank you.

605
01:33:59,828 --> 01:34:00,988
Fold.

606
01:34:05,267 --> 01:34:06,791
Fold.

607
01:34:11,707 --> 01:34:13,140
Thank you.

608
01:34:13,342 --> 01:34:14,509
Wins.

609
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:36,790
Deal me out.

610
01:34:37,599 --> 01:34:40,727
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

611
01:34:42,704 --> 01:34:44,462
Small blind, please.

612
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:51,170
- Who is it?
- It's 007.

613
01:35:52,441 --> 01:35:55,401
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

614
01:35:57,179 --> 01:36:02,643
Stay calm and don't interrupt. Because you'll be dead
within two minutes unless you do exactly what I tell you.

615
01:36:02,751 --> 01:36:06,211
- I'm all ears.
- Remove the defibrillator from the pouch.

616
01:36:06,214 --> 01:36:08,586
<i>- Do we know what it is yet?
- We're still scanning.</i>

617
01:36:13,829 --> 01:36:16,559
Attach the leads to your chest.

618
01:36:25,207 --> 01:36:27,675
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

619
01:36:27,676 --> 01:36:32,174
What the hell do we give him?
The kit has amphetamines, antihistamines hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?

620
01:36:32,314 --> 01:36:35,544
<i>- As soon as it reads charged--
- Lidocaine. That'll work.</i>

621
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:38,018
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don't push it.

622
01:36:38,019 --> 01:36:39,552
His heart's gonna stop.

623
01:36:39,554 --> 01:36:42,120
<i>There's only time for one charge before he passes out.</i>

624
01:36:42,924 --> 01:36:46,992
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

625
01:36:46,995 --> 01:36:49,293
<i>That'll counteract the digitalis.</i>

626
01:36:52,601 --> 01:36:56,228
You're going to pass out in a few seconds
and you need to keep your heart going.

627
01:36:56,238 --> 01:36:57,766
Push the red button now, Bond.

628
01:37:03,578 --> 01:37:06,572
- Bond, push the damn button!
- Do it now!

629
01:37:53,895 --> 01:37:56,263
- You okay?
- Me?

630
01:37:59,201 --> 01:38:01,795
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

631
01:38:02,003 --> 01:38:05,228
- Now get yourself off to a hospital.
- I will do.

632
01:38:06,675 --> 01:38:08,274
As soon as I've won this game.

633
01:38:08,276 --> 01:38:11,006
You're not seriously going back there?

634
01:38:13,582 --> 01:38:15,482
I wouldn't dream of it.

635
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:19,111
Bet. One million.

636
01:38:22,457 --> 01:38:27,115
- All in.
- Call. All in. Gentlemen, showdown, please.

637
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:31,030
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

638
01:38:34,669 --> 01:38:37,103
Queen plays. Wins.

639
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:50,074
Oh, I'm sorry.
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

640
01:38:51,086 --> 01:38:55,281
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game...

641
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:56,653
...which means no more buy-ins.

642
01:38:56,858 --> 01:39:00,055
The big blind is now 1 million dollars.

643
01:39:07,135 --> 01:39:08,461
Four players.

644
01:39:11,072 --> 01:39:12,437
It's your bet.

645
01:39:16,478 --> 01:39:18,038
- Monsieur Bond?
- Check.

646
01:39:18,046 --> 01:39:21,880
- Check.
- Twenty-four million in the pot already.

647
01:39:24,553 --> 01:39:28,780
Check. And check. All check.

648
01:39:29,057 --> 01:39:30,451
Four players.

649
01:39:35,263 --> 01:39:37,662
- Check.
- Check.

650
01:39:42,571 --> 01:39:44,932
All in. Six million.

651
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:48,265
Bet. Six million. All in.

652
01:39:53,615 --> 01:39:55,947
Five million. All in.

653
01:39:56,151 --> 01:39:58,711
Bet is 6 million.

654
01:40:06,228 --> 01:40:07,559
Raise.

655
01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:10,524
Raise.

656
01:40:10,532 --> 01:40:13,797
Twelve million. Heads up.

657
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:47,727
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

658
01:40:49,971 --> 01:40:51,802
Raise. All in.

659
01:41:10,692 --> 01:41:14,487
Well, I think I will call you on that one.

660
01:41:21,136 --> 01:41:22,330
Call.

661
01:41:34,215 --> 01:41:38,613
One hundred and fifteen million in the pot.

662
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:41,350
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

663
01:41:44,993 --> 01:41:47,527
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

664
01:41:55,503 --> 01:41:58,495
Full house. Eights full of aces.

665
01:42:16,658 --> 01:42:18,785
A higher full house.

666
01:42:18,994 --> 01:42:20,861
Aces full of sixes.

667
01:42:26,468 --> 01:42:27,662
Monsieur Bond.

668
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:47,210
Five and seven of spades.

669
01:42:47,422 --> 01:42:48,889
A straight flush.

670
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:50,387
Four to the eight.

671
01:42:50,592 --> 01:42:52,685
The high hand.

672
01:42:57,399 --> 01:42:59,323
Monsieur Bond wins.

673
01:42:59,934 --> 01:43:02,232
- For you.
- Thank you very much.

674
01:43:04,672 --> 01:43:05,866
Congratulations.

675
01:43:06,074 --> 01:43:09,801
- He's all yours.
- Much appreciated, brother.

676
01:43:16,784 --> 01:43:18,144
Congratulations.

677
01:43:18,152 --> 01:43:20,017
You know, I think a celebration's in order.

678
01:43:20,021 --> 01:43:22,546
You were almost dead an hour ago.

679
01:43:23,425 --> 01:43:26,417
Come on, I'm famished.

680
01:43:36,838 --> 01:43:38,703
Thank you.

681
01:43:46,314 --> 01:43:50,416
Mathis says the Americans have made contact with Le Chiffre.

682
01:43:50,418 --> 01:43:53,246
They're going to extract him before dawn.

683
01:43:53,755 --> 01:43:59,223
- You know, I think I'll call that a Vesper.
- Because of the bitter after taste?

684
01:43:59,227 --> 01:44:03,891
No. Because once you've tasted it, that's all you want to drink.

685
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:09,194
- I thought that was quite a good line.
- It was a very good line.

686
01:44:10,238 --> 01:44:11,728
But you're laughing at it.

687
01:44:12,073 --> 01:44:16,539
- Not so much it as you.
- Well, that's fine then.

688
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:24,208
I figured out what that is.

689
01:44:26,654 --> 01:44:28,918
It's an Algerian love knot.

690
01:44:29,124 --> 01:44:32,521
Really? I thought it was just something pretty.

691
01:44:32,527 --> 01:44:34,254
No, you didn't.

692
01:44:35,063 --> 01:44:36,630
Someone gave that to you.

693
01:44:40,235 --> 01:44:41,964
He's a very lucky man.

694
01:44:48,476 --> 01:44:51,309
You can switch off so easily, can't you?

695
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:54,374
It doesn't bother you, killing those people?

696
01:44:54,482 --> 01:44:57,708
Well, I wouldn't be very good at my job if it did.

697
01:44:58,453 --> 01:45:00,683
I don't believe you.

698
01:45:01,322 --> 01:45:03,483
You've got a choice, you know?

699
01:45:03,691 --> 01:45:07,823
Just because you've done something
doesn't mean you have to keep doing it.

700
01:45:07,829 --> 01:45:10,930
Why is it people who can't take advice always insist on giving it?

701
01:45:10,932 --> 01:45:13,200
You think I can't take my own advice?

702
01:45:13,801 --> 01:45:16,563
I think something is driving you.

703
01:45:17,005 --> 01:45:19,330
And I think I'll never find out what that is.

704
01:45:24,979 --> 01:45:27,106
Mathis needs me.

705
01:45:27,782 --> 01:45:29,044
Good night.

706
01:45:29,250 --> 01:45:31,181
Congratulations again.

707
01:45:49,871 --> 01:45:51,702
Mathis.

708
01:47:43,651 --> 01:47:46,787
I'm afraid your friend Mathis is really...

709
01:47:48,856 --> 01:47:50,653
...my friend Mathis.

710
01:49:33,628 --> 01:49:36,358
You've taken good care of your body.

711
01:49:42,903 --> 01:49:45,394
Such a waste.

712
01:50:02,657 --> 01:50:08,188
You know I never understood all these elaborate tortures.

713
01:50:08,195 --> 01:50:14,185
It's the simplest thing to cause more
pain than a man can possibly endure.

714
01:50:15,636 --> 01:50:20,166
And of course it's not only the immediate agony, but the knowledge...

715
01:50:20,174 --> 01:50:23,036
...that if you do not yield soon enough...

716
01:50:23,544 --> 01:50:27,373
...there will be little left to identify you as a man.

717
01:50:33,254 --> 01:50:39,154
The only question remains will you yield in time?

718
01:50:40,895 --> 01:50:44,023
I want the money.

719
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:06,386
Miss Lynd will give me the account number, if she hasn't already.

720
01:51:06,387 --> 01:51:08,753
So all I need from you is the password.

721
01:51:18,532 --> 01:51:21,763
The password, please.

722
01:51:26,006 --> 01:51:30,374
I've got a little itch down there.

723
01:51:31,145 --> 01:51:32,612
Would you mind?

724
01:51:40,354 --> 01:51:43,755
No! No! No!

725
01:51:44,725 --> 01:51:48,622
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

726
01:51:48,629 --> 01:51:51,063
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

727
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,490
Yeah!

728
01:51:55,736 --> 01:51:59,035
Yes, yes, yes.

729
01:52:04,712 --> 01:52:10,350
Now the whole world's gonna know that you died scratching my balls.

730
01:52:11,452 --> 01:52:13,443
I died?

731
01:52:13,654 --> 01:52:14,951
- I died?
- Yes.

732
01:52:15,156 --> 01:52:18,525
Because no matter what you do, I'm not gonna give you the password,...

733
01:52:18,535 --> 01:52:23,396
...which means your clients are gonna hunt you down and
cut you into little pieces of meat while you're still breathing.

734
01:52:23,397 --> 01:52:27,066
Because if you kill me there'll be nowhere else to hide.

735
01:52:27,268 --> 01:52:30,066
But you are so wrong!

736
01:52:30,271 --> 01:52:33,463
Because even after I slaughtered you and your little girlfriend...

737
01:52:33,474 --> 01:52:36,472
...your people would still welcome me with open arms...

738
01:52:37,812 --> 01:52:41,441
...because they need what I know.

739
01:52:42,683 --> 01:52:44,742
The big picture.

740
01:52:52,660 --> 01:52:57,030
Give me the password and I will at least let her live.

741
01:53:00,701 --> 01:53:03,995
Bond. Do it soon enough and she might even be in one piece.

742
01:53:16,884 --> 01:53:20,211
- You really aren't going to tell me, are you?
- No.

743
01:53:22,857 --> 01:53:24,757
So I think...

744
01:53:29,296 --> 01:53:32,932
...I'll feed you what you seem not to value.

745
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:48,144
I'll get the money.

746
01:53:49,049 --> 01:53:51,540
Tell them I'll get the money.

747
01:53:51,752 --> 01:53:56,412
Money isn't as valuable to our organization as knowing who to trust.

748
01:54:19,847 --> 01:54:21,246
Francesco.

749
01:54:22,182 --> 01:54:24,082
Francesco.

750
01:54:36,797 --> 01:54:38,924
Vesper.

751
01:54:40,801 --> 01:54:42,701
Vesper.

752
01:54:44,838 --> 01:54:46,362
No.

753
01:54:47,174 --> 01:54:48,505
Not him.

754
01:54:48,709 --> 01:54:50,609
Not Mathis.

755
01:54:52,446 --> 01:54:53,606
No.

756
01:54:54,448 --> 01:54:56,473
I'll get the doctor.

757
01:54:59,253 --> 01:55:01,050
Not him.

758
01:55:02,957 --> 01:55:04,417
Any ideas?

759
01:55:07,861 --> 01:55:11,895
- What?
- Why they left the two of you alive.

760
01:55:13,701 --> 01:55:15,134
Where is she?

761
01:55:16,170 --> 01:55:18,070
Sleeping.

762
01:55:18,672 --> 01:55:22,137
Well, I'm supposed to get you to drink this.

763
01:55:23,043 --> 01:55:29,014
It's just odd killing everyone else but leaving you and her untouched.

764
01:55:29,016 --> 01:55:32,549
Almost as if someone was trying to tell us something.

765
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:35,647
Get a look at the killer?

766
01:55:36,190 --> 01:55:37,919
No.

767
01:55:39,393 --> 01:55:40,826
Shame.

768
01:55:42,496 --> 01:55:44,225
Drink up.

769
01:55:47,634 --> 01:55:49,795
Anything else you remember?

770
01:55:50,004 --> 01:55:53,869
- Anything that can help us?
- Help us?

771
01:55:54,074 --> 01:55:56,304
Or help you?

772
01:56:36,683 --> 01:56:39,843
- Hello.
- Hello.

773
01:56:41,588 --> 01:56:42,885
You all right?

774
01:56:43,524 --> 01:56:45,685
I can't resist waking you.

775
01:56:45,893 --> 01:56:50,723
Every time I do, you look at me as if you haven't seen me in years.

776
01:56:51,665 --> 01:56:53,656
It makes me feel reborn.

777
01:56:57,404 --> 01:57:03,398
If you'd just been born wouldn't you be naked?

778
01:57:04,211 --> 01:57:06,406
You have me there.

779
01:57:09,083 --> 01:57:11,779
You can have me anywhere.

780
01:57:13,854 --> 01:57:15,378
I can?

781
01:57:15,589 --> 01:57:19,457
Yeah. Here, there, anywhere you like.

782
01:57:20,461 --> 01:57:23,562
Does this mean that you're warming to me?

783
01:57:23,564 --> 01:57:26,059
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

784
01:57:26,066 --> 01:57:31,469
It's just that not so long ago
I would have described your feelings towards me as....

785
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:35,768
...I'm trying to think of a better word than "loathing."

786
01:57:36,143 --> 01:57:39,044
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

787
01:57:39,580 --> 01:57:42,071
That is something to be afraid of.

788
01:57:44,852 --> 01:57:48,481
- Hello.
- Oh, perfect timing.

789
01:57:49,923 --> 01:57:53,053
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

790
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:57,261
My apologies, I do not mean to rush, but a 120 million is a large sum of money.

791
01:57:57,264 --> 01:58:00,297
It certainly is.
You didn't bring any chocolates with you?

792
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:01,927
I'm afraid not.

793
01:58:03,637 --> 01:58:06,504
If you would type in the account number.

794
01:58:13,580 --> 01:58:15,079
And now the password.

795
01:58:15,782 --> 01:58:16,942
You can do that.

796
01:58:17,651 --> 01:58:19,710
I would if I knew what it was.

797
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:24,110
V-E-S...

798
01:58:24,111 --> 01:58:26,911
...-P-E-R.

799
01:58:37,538 --> 01:58:39,335
The funds have been transferred.

800
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:42,407
Sorry for disturbing you.

801
01:58:44,244 --> 01:58:47,675
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

802
01:58:54,054 --> 01:58:55,453
You know, James...

803
01:58:58,058 --> 01:59:01,159
...I just want you to know that if all that was left of you...

804
01:59:01,161 --> 01:59:04,660
...was your smile and your little finger...

805
01:59:04,665 --> 01:59:07,595
...you'd still be more of a man than anyone I've ever met.

806
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:20,673
That's because you know what I can do with my little finger.

807
01:59:23,350 --> 01:59:27,418
- I have no idea.
- But you're aching to find out.

808
01:59:30,490 --> 01:59:34,626
You're not going to let me in there, are you?

809
01:59:35,162 --> 01:59:37,289
You've got your armor back on.

810
01:59:37,497 --> 01:59:38,725
That's that.

811
01:59:40,234 --> 01:59:42,794
I have no armor left.

812
01:59:44,037 --> 01:59:46,528
You've stripped it from me.

813
01:59:47,407 --> 01:59:53,275
Whatever is left of me...
Whatever is left of me...

814
01:59:54,047 --> 01:59:58,715
...whatever I am I'm yours.

815
02:01:00,007 --> 02:01:03,339
I suppose M won't miss me for a couple of days.

816
02:01:03,884 --> 02:01:07,115
- She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.
- Mathis?

817
02:01:07,321 --> 02:01:09,546
Remember I told you about Le Chiffre's tell?

818
02:01:09,556 --> 02:01:11,990
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

819
02:01:12,559 --> 02:01:14,117
That's how he wiped me out.

820
02:01:14,328 --> 02:01:18,191
Same goes for the implant.
Can't say I'm too sorry about losing that.

821
02:01:18,198 --> 02:01:20,393
I can't believe it.

822
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:22,192
No, neither could I.

823
02:01:22,669 --> 02:01:25,069
I thought he had my back.

824
02:01:25,739 --> 02:01:27,736
But there you go, lesson learned.

825
02:01:28,942 --> 02:01:31,342
Does everyone have a tell?

826
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:35,009
Yes.

827
02:01:37,951 --> 02:01:39,714
Everyone.

828
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:41,951
Everyone except you.

829
02:01:46,426 --> 02:01:48,451
I wonder if that's why I love you.

830
02:01:50,497 --> 02:01:52,431
You love me?

831
02:01:52,966 --> 02:01:57,830
Enough to quit and float round the world with you
until one of us has to find an honest job.

832
02:01:58,271 --> 02:02:02,532
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

833
02:02:03,243 --> 02:02:04,676
You're serious.

834
02:02:05,645 --> 02:02:07,545
Like you said...

835
02:02:08,115 --> 02:02:13,015
...you do what I do for too long
and there won't be any soul left to salvage.

836
02:02:13,019 --> 02:02:16,086
I'm leaving with what little I have left.

837
02:02:17,891 --> 02:02:19,984
Is that enough for you?

838
02:04:04,331 --> 02:04:06,731
- Come on.
- No. No.

839
02:04:06,733 --> 02:04:10,130
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

840
02:04:10,136 --> 02:04:12,331
What's the time?

841
02:04:14,574 --> 02:04:16,833
How much do you think we need to float for a month?

842
02:04:17,110 --> 02:04:18,873
I've got plenty.

843
02:04:19,079 --> 02:04:23,215
No, I want to pay for my half of our aimless wanderings.

844
02:04:25,952 --> 02:04:28,284
You stopped wearing the necklace.

845
02:04:28,488 --> 02:04:31,651
Yeah. It was time.

846
02:04:31,858 --> 02:04:34,588
Time enough to get over someone?

847
02:04:39,366 --> 02:04:42,933
To realize sometimes you can forget the past.

848
02:04:51,444 --> 02:04:53,344
Though apparently not your employer.

849
02:04:57,784 --> 02:05:01,015
Back in one month.

850
02:05:02,088 --> 02:05:06,888
Come on. I'll get the money you get supplies.

851
02:05:36,523 --> 02:05:38,957
I'll see you back here in half an hour.

852
02:06:03,450 --> 02:06:06,084
- Hello, M.
- I got your note.

853
02:06:06,086 --> 02:06:09,787
<i>- Yes?
- We'll talk about that later.</i>

854
02:06:09,990 --> 02:06:15,982
Right now I have a lovely man from the Treasury here
wondering if you're ever going to deposit the winnings.

855
02:06:19,466 --> 02:06:22,499
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

856
02:06:22,502 --> 02:06:25,801
<i>Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.</i>

857
02:06:26,006 --> 02:06:28,467
So you'll be depositing it today.

858
02:06:28,508 --> 02:06:31,136
On my way to the bank right now.

859
02:06:31,544 --> 02:06:34,240
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

860
02:06:34,714 --> 02:06:35,874
<i>Hello.</i>

861
02:06:36,082 --> 02:06:39,683
Mr. Mendel?
I'm having trouble accessing the funds in my account.

862
02:06:39,686 --> 02:06:44,017
It was transferred to the account number your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

863
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:50,261
It appears the funds are being withdrawn as we speak.

864
02:06:52,766 --> 02:06:56,397
- Where?
- The Venice branch, of course. St. Mark's Square.

865
02:06:58,405 --> 02:07:00,100
<i>Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?</i>

866
02:09:12,806 --> 02:09:14,266
I'll kill her!

867
02:09:14,974 --> 02:09:16,468
Allow me.

868
02:13:36,102 --> 02:13:38,070
I'm sorry, James.

869
02:16:49,729 --> 02:16:52,659
<i>She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.</i>

870
02:16:52,665 --> 02:16:54,724
<i>They were very much in love.</i>

871
02:16:55,134 --> 02:16:58,462
<i>He was kidnapped by the organization behind Le Chiffre.</i>

872
02:16:58,471 --> 02:17:03,631
And they blackmailed her, threatening to kill him unless she cooperated.

873
02:17:03,643 --> 02:17:09,478
We should've picked up on it but sometimes we're so
focused on our enemies we forget to watch our friends.

874
02:17:10,816 --> 02:17:12,681
<i>How are you doing?</i>

875
02:17:13,019 --> 02:17:15,249
She left her cell phone.

876
02:17:15,454 --> 02:17:17,820
She must have known I'd check it.

877
02:17:18,624 --> 02:17:20,785
She knew you were you.

878
02:17:21,861 --> 02:17:24,291
<i>- Well, at least this clears Mathis.
- No.</i>

879
02:17:24,297 --> 02:17:25,924
- No?
- No.

880
02:17:26,132 --> 02:17:28,823
We just proved that she's guilty, not that he's innocent.

881
02:17:28,834 --> 02:17:31,366
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

882
02:17:31,971 --> 02:17:35,574
- You don't trust anyone, do you, James?
- No.

883
02:17:36,075 --> 02:17:38,339
Then you've learnt your lesson.

884
02:17:39,145 --> 02:17:41,940
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

885
02:17:42,081 --> 02:17:43,241
Will do.

886
02:17:45,518 --> 02:17:48,683
<i>- If you do need time....
- Why should I need more time?</i>

887
02:17:49,488 --> 02:17:52,753
The job's done, and the bitch is dead.

888
02:17:53,693 --> 02:17:59,690
James did you ever ask yourself why you weren't killed that night?

889
02:18:00,132 --> 02:18:01,827
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

890
02:18:02,034 --> 02:18:06,193
<i>She made a deal to spare your life in exchange for the money.</i>

891
02:18:06,205 --> 02:18:08,566
<i>I'm sure she hoped they would let her live.</i>

892
02:18:09,942 --> 02:18:13,134
But she must have known she was going to her death.

893
02:18:14,046 --> 02:18:17,181
<i>And now we'll never know who was behind this.</i>

894
02:18:17,183 --> 02:18:19,743
<i>The trail's gone cold.</i>

895
02:19:47,073 --> 02:19:49,173
<i>- Hello.
- Mr. White?</i>

896
02:19:49,375 --> 02:19:50,865
<i>We need to talk.</i>

897
02:19:51,076 --> 02:19:52,941
Who is this?

898
02:20:23,042 --> 02:20:27,383
The name's Bond. James Bond.
