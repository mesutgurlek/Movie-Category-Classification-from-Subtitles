1
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,960
Whoo-hoo!

2
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,360
- Come on, we're outta here!
- Easy, Rocky.

3
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,360
All right, guys,
we're 15 seconds from the drop zone.

4
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,360
All right, pinheads,
the Stealth Eagle's about to fly.

5
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,360
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.

6
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,760
Well, lead on, flyboys.

7
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,160
- That's a lotta air!
- After you, Skull!

8
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,160
What are you? Crazy? This was your idea!

9
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,360
Hey, guys. You might wanna slip those on.

10
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,960
Good idea.

11
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
We're three seconds away
from the target zone. Aisha, you're on!

12
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,960
Yes!

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,760
Stylin'!

14
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,960
On your tail! Whoo!

15
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,760
All systems go!

16
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,360
Banzai!

17
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,760
Whoo-hoo!

18
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,760
- Show 'em your stuff.
- You got it. Surf's up!

19
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,560
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

20
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,560
Catch you on the flip side.

PA: With the arrival
of Ryan"s Comet two days away,

39
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,960
the Angel Grove jump-a-thon will
breathe new life into the old observatory.

40
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Tickets to see the comet
are at the Fire Department booth.

41
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,360
Now, folks, raise your eyes to the skies, cos
here comes the team from Angel Grove High!

42
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,560
All right, Dad, pay close attention.
This is how the pros do it.

43
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,160
- I didn't do so bad.
- You landed in the parking lot.

44
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,960
- It was embarrassing.
- Well...

45
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,560
PA: The first of the team
is beginning his final approach. It"s Adam!

46
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,560
As he rounds the turn, he looks awful low...

47
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,760
but he pulls up just in time
and hits the target dead centre.

48
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,160
Right behind him is skydiver Billy...
who manages a perfect landing!

49
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Skydiver number three is Kimberly!

50
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,160
Her landing is flawless!

51
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,560
And here comes Rocky...

52
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,360
who lands right on target!

53
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,960
Here comes Aisha! She makes it a perfect five
out of five landing and ties the 1986 record.

54
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,960
So now it"s all up to Tommy Oliver.
Can he make it six for six?

55
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,760
Yeah! Go, Tommy!

56
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,960
PA: He"s making his final approach.
Looks a bit wide, but still OK.

57
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,360
Almost to the ground now. Can he do it?

58
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,960
He does! The Angel Grove team
sets a new city record! Way to go, guys!

59
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,760
- Let's go.
- OK.

60
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,960
PA: Remember, folks, Ryan"s Comet
will be passing in just two days.

61
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,560
- Looking good up there.
- Thanks. Maybe next time you can join us.

62
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,360
Really? Could l?

63
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,160
Yeah, well, we'll talk about that, Fred...
in about 10 or 1 2 years, all right?

64
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,760
Congratulations, Tommy.
The observatory just got a new lease on life.

65
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,160
- Yeah. Thanks, man.
- FRED: Awesome.

66
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,160
- Ryan's Comet is passing over in two days!
- Guys, we did it!

67
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,800
- That was awesome, Tommy.
- Wonderful.

68
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,520
- Thanks, guys. You too, man.

69
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,320
- Hey, has anybody seen Bulk and Skull?

70
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,120
Ernie's is serving a free dessert with lunch.
They probably landed on the roof.

71
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,520
- PILOT: Hurry up. We're runnin' out of fuel.
- BULK: I gotta be the eagle.

72
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,920
I'm gonna be the eagle!

73
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,320
Be the swallow!

74
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,720
- Be the swallow.
- Come on, baby!

75
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,720
- BULK: Let go of me!
- SKULL: I want my mommy!

76
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,520
TOMMY: Rock and roll!

which way to go #

80
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,320
# So I've come here to
give you a hand #

81
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,920
# And lead you into the promised land #

82
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,520
- Air time!
- Up and away!

83
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
# Come on and take it be my side #

84
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,320
# Come on and take a tree ride #

85
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,120
- Let's take a shortcut.
- Right behind you!

86
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,320
# Come on and take a free ride #

87
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,520
# Come on and take it by my side #

88
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,120
SKULL: Hey, this doesn't look like the target
landing zone! Where's the free food?

89
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,320
You idiot! Your screaming threw off
the Stealth Eagle's sense of direction.

90
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Stealth Eagle? Lame duck is more like it.

91
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,320
- Hey!
- Uh-oh.

92
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,120
- You guys, what do you think you're doing?
- Uh...

93
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,920
We're from the Angel Grove
Building lnspector's office.

94
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,920
Yeah. That building's
supposed to be over there!

95
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,520
And what's that man doing
without proper foot protection?

96
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,920
- Who's in charge around here, huh?
- Huh?

97
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,520
- Huh?
- Huh?

98
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,920
Hey, Dave! Come and have a look at this.

99
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,920
Go on, Dave.

100
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,000
- That was a close one.
- Uh-huh.

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,720
- You hungry?
- Always.

102
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,320
What in the world is this?

103
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,320
It sure as heck ain't DWP.

104
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,720
Let's get a crane in here.

105
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,720
OK, take it up!

106
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,320
Incredible.

107
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,320
What do you think it is?

108
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,720
No... idea.

109
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,520
Aaaaarrgghh!

110
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,520
John, you all right?

111
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,320
ROCKY: Let's get somethin' to eat.

112
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,520
(bleeping)

113
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,320
TOMMY: Hang on.

114
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,520
Let's go over there.

115
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,920
- What's up, Alpha?
- Rangers, Zordon needs you. It"s urgent.

116
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,320
We're on our way.

117
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,480
Aye-yai-yai-yai! The subtronic
interphasers are short-circuiting.

118
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,080
I have to find a way to alternate
the frequency modulators.

119
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,880
What's goin' on?

120
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,080
A massive surge of evil energy is
overloading our sensors. Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!

121
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,480
Rangers, you must act swiftly.

122
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,080
- The planet is in grave danger.
- Danger from what?

123
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,880
6,000 years ago a morphological being
known as lvan Ooze ruled the world

124
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,880
with a reign of unparalleled terror.

125
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,480
He was on the verge of completing
construction of his ultimate weapons:

126
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,880
the Ecto-Morphicon Titans, twin machines
capable of enslaving the entire universe.

127
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,080
What happened to him?

128
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,280
A group of warriors like yourselves
lured him to into a hyperlock chamber

129
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,080
and buried him deep underground.

130
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,080
But now the chamber
has been accidentally uncovered.

131
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,280
You must return it to the depths
before it is opened and lvan is released.

132
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,080
His Ecto-Morphicons were buried near
the chamber. If lvan escapes, he'll find them.

133
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,880
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You're dealing
with an evil that is beyond all imagination.

134
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,560
( snoring )

135
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,360
- What do I care about some stupid egg?
- This is no ordinary egg!

136
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,560
- Well, I say we hard-boil the thing!
- I'm with her. I'm hungry.

137
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,360
- That's cos you're a pig!
- Hey, Kurt, take a look at this.

138
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,160
No need to wake him. In fact,
why don't you take a little nap yourself?

139
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,560
PIG: Yeah, I could do that.
I just choose not to.

140
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,960
Zip your lips.

141
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,560
After 2,000 years of searching...

142
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,560
you are finally within my grasp.

143
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,560
And now... Iet's crack this egg.

144
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,160
Excellent.

145
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,960
Yuck!

146
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,560
What?! You spent 2,000 years
looking for a tub of snot?!

147
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,560
Patience, motor-mouth. Watch.

148
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,960
( laughs )

149
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,760
Yes!

150
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,160
Cool!

151
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,360
( yawns loudly )

152
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Ladies and gentlemen!

153
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,960
The Ooze is back!

154
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,160
Yeah!

155
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,160
- He's so handsome!
- Why, thank you.

156
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,360
I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy
of all that is good and decent.

157
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,160
- It is a supreme honour to finally meet you.
- How can I ever repay you?

158
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,360
Do you recall the name Zordon of Eltar?

159
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,160
I think he's heard of him.

160
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,760
I want you to destroy Zordon... so that
my evil may once again reign supreme!

161
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,760
I will not only destroy him...

162
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,760
I will obliterate his entire legacy.

163
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,360
It will be as if Zordon of Eltar never existed!

164
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,360
- Finally, a real man!
- ( growls )

165
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,160
We shall leave you to weave your evil ways.

166
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,960
Let's go, Rita.

167
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,160
What is that odious stench?

168
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,360
Smells like...

169
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,560
teenagers.

170
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,960
Anybody see anything?

171
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,360
Let's take a look up there.

172
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,960
Ugh!

173
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,560
- AISHA: What is it?
- ROCKY: It reeks.

174
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Hey! What are you kids doin' here?

175
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,960
You haven't seen a morphological being
lurking around here?

176
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,960
- A morphological being?
- Yeah.

177
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,360
What the heck is that?

178
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,160
Wait a second.

179
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Did it look something like this?

180
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,560
- Ew, gross!
- Too kind. Allow me to introduce myself.

181
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,560
I am the galactically feared,
globally reviled, universally despised...

182
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,160
They call me lvan Ooze.

183
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,760
Well, pack your bags, cos we're sending
you back where you came from.

184
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,360
Gee, a teenager with a big mouth.

185
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,360
Not much has changed in 6,000 years.

186
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,560
You obviously don't know
who you're dealing with, Mr Raisin Head.

187
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,560
- Really?
- Yeah. We're the Power Rangers.

188
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,160
Where's my autograph book? Ha!

189
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,160
Power Rangers, huh?

190
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,560
So Zordon's still usin'
a bunch of kids to do his dirty work.

191
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,160
Well... meet my kids!

192
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,560
Ew.

193
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,760
From this moment forth
the world as you know it shall cease to exist!

194
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,560
Welcome to my nightmare!

195
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,160
Bye-bye, kiddies!

196
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,720
He's gone.

197
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,520
- What are we gonna do?
- ROCKY: There's plenty of room down there.

198
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,320
Go, guys!

199
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,920
- Let's take these beasts!
- Spread out!

200
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,320
( # "Are You Ready?!" by Devo )

201
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,520
Welcome to my nightmare.

202
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,920
# Action boy now #

203
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,720
# Action girl now #

204
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,120
# Be prepared to climb
another mountain #

205
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,320
Ever play Kick The Can?

206
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,720
# Action boy now #

207
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,520
# Action girl now #

208
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,520
# Be prepared to surf across
the ocean #

209
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,120
Kiss and make up.

210
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,320
# To fill your plate #

211
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,520
# Be prepared #

212
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,720
# Don't hesitate #

213
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,520
# Be prepared #

214
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,920
# For a great big bust #

215
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,520
# Be prepared #

216
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,720
# To do what you must #

217
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,520
# Be prepared #

218
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,320
# To take a hit #

219
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,120
Let me get the door.

220
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,120
# Be prepared #

221
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,920
# For a sneak attack #

222
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,120
You ooze, you lose.

223
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,920
Sit down!

224
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,320
See ya!

225
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,320
Right behind you, Kimberly.

226
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,920
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

227
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,120
Adam!

228
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,920
- AISHA: They got us cornered!
- BILLY: We can't hold them off!

229
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,320
- BILLY: There's too many of 'em.
- Let's do it, guys! It's morphin' time!

230
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,720
Pterodactyl!

231
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,320
Triceratops!

232
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,520
Tyrannosaurus!

233
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,720
Mastodon!

234
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,520
Sabre-toothed tiger!

235
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,120
White tiger!

236
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,520
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

237
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,320
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

238
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,720
# Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #

239
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,520
- Where'd they go?
- Keep your eyes peeled.

240
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,120
Heads up, guys! Over there!

241
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,720
- Careful. It could be a trap.
- Right.

242
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,800
Let's go.

243
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,120
Alpha, my sensors tell me
the Rangers were too late.

244
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,120
- lvan is on his way here.
- Don't worry.

245
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,720
Nobody enters the command centre
without a power coin.

246
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,520
( squelching )

247
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,920
Well, almost nobody.

248
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,520
Hey, pretty fancy-schmancy.

249
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,120
I guess if you invest
your money well over 60 centuries,

250
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,520
you can buy something pretty nice.

251
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,920
Uh-oh.

252
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,720
( laughs )

253
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,320
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai....

254
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,720
You haven't changed, Ooze. You're still
picking on creatures smaller than yourself.

255
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Put a sock in it, Z! 10 minutes out of the egg
and I'm listening to one of your lectures.

256
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,720
You locked me into your
stuffy hyperlock chamber

257
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,320
and tossed me away in the depths
like yesterday's trash.

258
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,320
You any idea what it's like to be locked up
in a rotten egg for 6,000 years? It's boring.

259
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Not to mention I've had a charley horse
since the Renaissance.

260
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,720
- You won't get away with this, Ooze.
- You robbed me of my prime.

261
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,520
I was the supreme ruler
of the most foul empire in the universe.

262
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,120
And now... it's time to pay the piper.

263
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,320
Oh, the things that I have missed!

264
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,120
The Black Plague!

265
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,720
The Spanish lnquisition!

266
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,720
The Brady Bunch reunion!

267
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,720
( laughs )

268
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,120
- BILLY: This place gives me the creeps.
- AISHA: I heard that.

269
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,120
TOMMY: I've got a bad feelin'
about this place.

270
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,520
( squawking )

271
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,720
- KIMBERLY: Anybody see anything?
- We need some light.

272
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,120
Activating power beam.

273
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,120
- They gotta be around here somewhere.
- Activating power scope.

274
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,320
TOMMY: Talk to me, Rocky. What do we got?

275
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,720
I don't know what these purple creeps
are made of, but I can't lock 'em down.

276
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,120
TOMMY: All right. Stay alert.

277
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,720
- Over there!
- Let's power up!

278
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,120
- ALL: Right!
- AISHA: Here they come!

279
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,320
You guys make me sick, sick, sick!

280
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,720
Back off!

281
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,520
Have a nice flight!

282
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,920
Later, dudes.

283
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,920
It's gonna be one messy night.

284
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,920
- Up and over?
- Let's do it!

285
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,120
ADAM: Rocky, behind you!

286
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,120
Goin' airborne!

287
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,720
These guys don't know when to quit.
Double whammy?

288
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,520
You're on.

289
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,520
Uh-oh!

290
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,520
Whoaaaa!

291
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,520
That does it. Stegastinger!

292
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,720
Did you miss me?

293
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,320
Pterodactyl Thunderwhip!

294
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,720
Have a nice trip! See you next fall.

295
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,120
Bye-bye.

296
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,120
Gotta love it.

297
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,520
Hold on, Aisha!

298
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,320
One, two, three, four, five, six!

299
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,720
Aisha!

300
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,320
- You OK?
- They're tough.

301
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,320
- Let's finish these purple parasites.
- You said it.

302
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,720
I want you guys to meet Saba.

303
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,320
ALL: Uh-oh!

304
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,920
ALL: Yeah!

305
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,520
TOMMY: Now let's go find lvan.

306
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,080
KIMBERLY: Hey, what's happening?

307
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,280
BILLY: We're losing power.

308
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,680
- What's goin' on?
- Alpha, come in.

309
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,880
- Something's wrong.
- We'd better get back. Let's go, guys.

310
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,280
BILLY: Oh, no.

311
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,080
- Ooze.
- TOMMY: Let's get it open.

312
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,480
TOMMY: Look at this place.

313
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,880
TOMMY: I can't believe it.

314
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,880
AISHA: What happened here?

315
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,880
KIMBERLY: Oh, no.

316
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,280
ADAM: Zordon!

317
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,280
What's happening to him?

318
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,680
Outside of his time warp, he's dying.

319
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,680
BILLY: He needs power.

320
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,880
Rangers.

321
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,280
Thank goodness you are safe.

322
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,280
Come on, we gotta get you back inside.

323
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,880
I'm afraid that is impossible.

324
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,080
The power has been destroyed.

325
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,680
It is gone.

326
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,480
The Zords...

327
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,280
the weapons...

328
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,680
all of it.

329
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,880
The Power Rangers are no more.

330
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,280
Ivan Ooze has won.

331
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,880
- We're losing him.
- Zordon, you can't leave us!

332
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,880
Ever since you came into our lives,
you've been like a father to us all.

333
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,080
You must be strong.

334
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,680
Rangers!

335
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,480
TOMMY: Alpha.

336
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,680
- Are you OK?
- I'll be fine.

337
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,280
There may be a power
that can save Zordon.

338
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,880
- What power?
- It is on the distant planet of Phaedos.

339
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,080
It's very dangerous.
All who have tried for it have perished.

340
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,880
- But we have to try, Alpha.
- Zordon's life force will not last long.

341
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,880
- You won't have much time.
- How can we get it?

342
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,080
Maybe if I can download the last plasmatic
morphing gem into the transport core,

343
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,080
I might have just enough power
to get you there.

344
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,280
- But there won't be any left to get you back.
- So, how do we get back?

345
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,280
We have to hope that the power is there.

346
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,280
Zordon's life depends on it.

347
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,880
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

348
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,080
We may not have our powers,
but we're still the Power Rangers.

349
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Remember, Rangers,
Zordon doesn't have much time.

350
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,680
Oh, no! Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!

351
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,080
Please hold on, Zordon!

352
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,680
I can't believe it! How could he
let them slip through his hands?!

353
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,680
He's no better than the rest of the hired help!

354
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,080
Oh, give it a rest.

355
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,280
- Hi, honey, I'm home!
- You egg-sucking purple pinhead!

356
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,680
The Rangers are going after the great power!

357
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,280
I thought you said this guy
was the master of disaster!

358
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,680
He's nothing but
a slime-infested jelly doughnut!

359
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,280
Finally someone shut her up.

360
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,480
Your feebleness is staggering.

361
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,480
You obviously need a vacation.

362
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,280
I think circumstances
force us to choose a new leader...

363
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,280
and I pick... me!

364
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,280
Who does this clown think he's dealing with?

365
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,280
The bogeyman is taking over.

366
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,480
No one double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives!

367
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,280
Oh, stop it! It tickles!

368
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,480
My turn.

369
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,480
- RITA: (squeaky voice) Way to go, bonehead!
- ZEDD: You can't trust anyone in this galaxy!

370
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,080
- I love snow globes.
- RITA: Earthquake! Earthquake!

371
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,080
Now you have a choice. You either serve me...

372
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,080
or you can join these
insufferable dingledorks!

373
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,680
- Goldar, get us out of here!
- Don't listen to that purple booger!

374
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,480
ZEDD: Don't you dare betray me!

375
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,280
- We never liked those dingledorks.
- PIG: You said it. They stink.

376
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,680
So... what are we going to do about
the Power Rangers, oh my hideous one?

377
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,080
Ah, yes.

378
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,480
The Power Rangers.

379
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,680
( snorts )

380
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,480
- Good distance.
- Yeah.

381
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,680
( squawking )

382
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:04,280
Shut your beaks! Now,
my Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos,

383
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,480
you will find the Power Rangers
and you will tear them apart!

384
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,280
- GOLDAR: Go sic 'em, Tweety!
- PIG: Happy hunting!

385
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,680
Wow.

386
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,880
My gosh. Look at this place.

387
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,480
AISHA: You guys! Over here! Quick!

388
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,680
AISHA: Whoa. Looks like
somebody had a bad day.

389
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,880
- What is it?
- I think the question is "What was it?"

390
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,480
Definitely not the welcoming committee,
that's for sure.

391
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,880
Come on, guys, we got a job to do.

392
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Taking over the world is one thing.

393
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,280
Finding good help to run it for you,
that's the killer.

394
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,280
Would you like me to make a few calls?

395
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,680
No need. I'm going to recruit
the parents of Angel Grove.

396
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,880
No offence, boss,
but they might find you a little disgusting.

397
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,080
( belches )

398
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,080
Well, I suppose you'd be the experts on that.

399
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,480
- You forget. I'm a master of disguise.
- How could I forget? I never knew.

400
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,480
First I'll turn them into zombies

401
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,080
and then order them
to dig up my Ecto-Morphicons.

402
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,880
How you gonna do that?

403
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,880
By showing them the wonders
of being wicked with a little bit of lvan's ooze.

404
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,480
( laughs )

405
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,280
Ooh!

406
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:57,080
Finally I get to finish
what I started 6,000 years ago!

407
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,880
Little do they know my weapons of
destruction lie buried beneath their feet.

408
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,480
( all laugh )

409
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,880
- Stop it! Get to work!
- PIG: Yes, Your Royal Heinous Highness.

410
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,480
Hey.

411
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,920
You OK?

412
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,880
I was just thinking about Zordon.

413
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,680
You know, everything
we've been through together.

414
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,680
Look, he's gonna make it.

415
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,680
We'll find this power

416
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,080
and then send that slimeball lvan Ooze
back to the sewer he crawled out of.

417
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,880
Come on.

418
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,080
What the heck was that?

419
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,680
BILLY: Get down!

420
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,680
TOMMY: Let's move!

421
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,880
ROCKY: Look out!

422
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,080
They're everywhere!

423
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,880
Take cover!

424
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,880
Back off.

425
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,080
- Know the funny thing about morphin'?
- What?

426
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,480
You don't appreciate it till you can't do it!

427
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,280
TOMMY: Kimberly, behind you!

428
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,280
Hang on, Kimberly!

429
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,480
Somebody help me!

430
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,080
- They're too strong!
- We need our powers!

431
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,840
Let me go, Big Bird!

432
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,640
( whistling noise )

433
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,040
( whistling noise continues )

434
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,840
That was amazing. Thanks.

435
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,840
If you want to thank me,
go back to wherever it is you came from.

436
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,840
- We can't.
- We were told there was a great power here.

437
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,240
- Is it true?
- Yes.

438
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,040
The ground is littered with the bones
of those who have tried for it and failed.

439
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,440
Well, we're different. We won't fail.

440
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,640
Leave Phaedos... before it's too late.

441
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Look, we don't want any trouble.
Our leader Zordon got hurt...

442
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,240
Zordon?

443
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,640
Did you say Zordon?

444
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,640
You know Zordon? Who are you?

445
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,640
I am Dulcea, master warrior
of the planet Phaedos.

446
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,640
What has happened to Zordon?

447
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,640
He was attacked by
this cosmic being named lvan Ooze.

448
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,640
- lvan Ooze is free?
- You've heard of him?

449
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,040
Ivan Ooze is a monster.

450
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,640
If we don't hurry, your planet is doomed.

451
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,440
Follow me.

452
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,240
Alpha, I am deeply concerned
about the Rangers.

453
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,640
Please, Zordon, save your strength.

454
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,040
You need to rest.

455
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,840
We must try to communicate with them.
It is possible I can help them.

456
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:00,240
If I could locate a vertical deflector, we could
make contact through the viewing globe.

457
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,840
Please... please hurry.

458
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,240
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai! Hold on.

459
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,640
Guys and girls, girls and guys,
gather round and feast your eyes.

460
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,040
I promise you all, you just can't lose,

461
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,040
when you've got
your own supply of lvan's ooze.

462
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,240
- BOY: What are we supposed to do with it?
- Show it to parents, show it to friends.

463
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,240
When you've got your ooze,
the fun never ends.

464
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,040
This is kinda gross.

465
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,040
You may have heard
that looks can be deceiving.

466
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,040
I'm sure that when you've tried it,
you all will be believing.

467
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,440
And did I mention it's free?

468
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,840
- I'll take some.
- Here you go. Who else?

469
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,440
OK, there's enough for everybody.
Take it home in boxes, take it home in cases.

470
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,640
If your parents try to stop you,
just throw it in their faces!

471
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,840
BILLY: Dulcea, where are you taking us?

472
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,840
You shall know soon enough.

473
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,440
KIMBERLY: We have to hurry.
Zordon won't last much longer.

474
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,840
TOMMY: Wow.

475
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,840
- AISHA: Amazing.
- TOMMY: What is this place?

476
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,040
DULCEA: These are the ancient ruins
of the Ninjetti Temple.

477
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,240
There, beyond the Niola Jungle,
is the monolith.

478
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,840
Inside awaits the power of the universe.

479
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,440
The monolith
is heavily guarded against intruders.

480
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,640
No one has ever survived
an attempt to reach it.

481
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,040
Then how can we?

482
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,440
You were chosen by Zordon.

483
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,040
I have faith in his wisdom.

484
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,440
Can you help us?

485
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,840
We will call upon
the sacred animals of the Ninjetti for help.

486
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,600
Fred!

487
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,600
There, that should do it. Let's give it a whirl!

488
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,400
Police have been fielding
hundreds of calls from concerned citizens

489
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,400
as the number of missing parents
continues to grow.

490
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,600
Hi, folks. Ivan Ooze here.
Are you bored with your work?

491
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,400
Are you bored with your life? Then come on
down to Ooze City and let"s get sticky!

492
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,800
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!

493
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,200
Ivan's evil plot is taking shape.

494
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,520
I just hope they're not too late.

495
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,440
Buried deep within each of us
is an animal spirit waiting to be released.

496
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,640
Close your eyes and look deep inside.

497
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:58,840
Aisha, you are the bear,
fierce and unstoppable.

498
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:06,040
Rocky, powerful, smart,
you are the mighty ape.

499
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,840
Billy, you are the wolf, cunning and swift.

500
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:22,240
Agile Kimberly, light as a feather,
you are the crane.

501
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,080
Adam...

502
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,640
- Adam, what's wrong?
- I'm a frog.

503
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,640
Yes, a frog. Like the one you kiss...
to get a handsome prince.

504
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,040
And you, Tommy, are the falcon,
winged lord of the skies.

505
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:53,440
To be in harmony with a sacred animal
spirit is to have the force of the Ninjetti.

506
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,840
To those who are Ninjetti,
anything is possible.

507
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,440
But... I am afraid
you must do this on you own.

508
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,640
You're not coming with us, Dulcea?

509
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,640
If only I could.

510
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:18,640
One step beyond this plateau and I would
begin to age as rapidly as Zordon is now.

511
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,040
The strength is inside you. Trust it.

512
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,440
Your sacred animals will be your guide.

513
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,040
May your animal spirits watch over you.

514
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,040
Dad?

515
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,040
Dad?

516
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,840
Dad? Where are you?

517
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,240
IVAN: I forgot how slow parents are.

518
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,840
I thought my Ecto-Morphicons
would be dug up by now.

519
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,640
Oh, Goldie, I'm bored.

520
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,640
Let's have some fun. Hey, you!

521
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,240
Dance.

522
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,040
( rock and roll music )

523
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,240
Do the swim.

524
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,040
- Ballet!
- (ballet music)

525
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,840
( Ivan and Goldar laugh )

526
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,040
Hey.

527
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,040
Hey, boss! They're back!

528
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,640
Ah!

529
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,440
My Tengu.

530
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,440
(squawking)

531
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,440
Stop your screeching.

532
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,840
- How did you fare?
- It couldn't have gone better.

533
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,840
Threw one of 'em off a mountain,
one into a ragin' river.

534
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,840
So, they've all been destroyed?

535
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,840
- Well, we were about to destroy them, but...
- What?

536
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,640
You didn't kill them? You call yourself Tengu
warriors? You're more like Tengu turkeys!

537
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,640
I'll have you all stuffed and roasted!

538
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,440
But, master, there was this monster with
these huge sticks and it kept twirling them...

539
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,640
Sticks? Did these sticks
have a whistling sound?

540
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,240
It was more like nails on a chalkboard.

541
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,040
Dulcea.

542
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,840
That miserable, manipulating,
loathsome she-devil of a witch!

543
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,840
If she leads them to the great power,
everything will be ruined.

544
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:51,640
- Do you want us to take another whack at it?
- How about takin' another quack at it?

545
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:00,040
No time to waste. My Ecto-Morphicon
machines must be unearthed by sundown.

546
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,440
It's time.

547
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,440
BILLY: Man, this jungle goes on for ever.

548
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,640
TOMMY: We've gotta keep movin', guys.
Zordon's time is runnin' out.

549
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,600
Dad!

550
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,200
Dad!

551
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,600
Hey, Dad!

552
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,600
Dad, what's wrong with you?

553
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,800
It's me - Fred.
Dad, we gotta get outta here!

554
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,600
Hey, you!

555
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,200
Get back to work!

556
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,400
PIG: Yeah! Pick up those rocks!
Tote that barge! Lift that bale!

557
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,000
GOLDAR: Put your weak backs into it!

558
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
PIG: Yeah, I had a weak back
about a week back.

559
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:12,800
Feast your eyes on the exoskeleton
of the Barbaric Hornitor!

560
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,800
The Dreaded Scorpitron
should be close by.

561
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,400
Once my lovely little Ecto-Morphicon
machines are up and running,

562
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
spreading ooze throughout the world,

563
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,800
I shall annihilate Angel Grove,
and then... the universe!

564
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,200
PIG: # We're takin' over the world!
We're takin' over the world #

565
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,400
- AISHA: What is this place?
- BILLY: Looks like some kind of graveyard.

566
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,400
- KIMBERLY: I wonder what happened.
- ADAM: Personally, I'd rather not find out.

567
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,600
- Welcome to Jurassic Park.
- AISHA: Very funny, Adam.

568
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,400
TOMMY: Aisha, get outta there!

569
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,000
Rocky!

570
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,200
Uh-oh.

571
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,200
Wait for me!

572
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,400
- Tommy!
- Hang on!

573
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,800
Tommy!

574
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,000
All right, bonehead!

575
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,600
- Tommy, hang on!
- Whoa! Whoa!

576
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,200
Tommy!

577
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,200
Whoa!

578
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,200
Hold on tight, Tommy!

579
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,800
Yo, fossil head!
I've got a bone to pick with you!

580
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,600
Huh? Whoa!

581
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,000
Are you OK?

582
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,200
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Biology finally paid off for you, huh?

583
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,200
We should get outta here
before he pulls himself together.

584
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,000
Yeah.

585
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:41,560
GOLDAR: You there! Let's show a little
initiative! And you, get your rear in gear!

586
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:52,960
Pick up the pace! We haven't got all day!

587
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,760
- Hey, boss, construction is completed.
- PIG: Yeah, when's lunch?

588
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,760
Parents of Angel Grove!

589
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,360
You have completed my Ecto-Morphicons!

590
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,760
But, frankly, I'm sick of your ugly faces
and your dull personalities.

591
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,560
- Yeah!
- (giggles/snorts)

592
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:15,160
You will return to the construction site
and leap to your doom.

593
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,960
- Leap to your doom.
- Bye-bye.

594
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,960
- GOLDAR: Bye-bye!
- GOLDAR: Aloha!

595
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,760
GOLDAR: Arrivederci!

596
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,160
- Dad!
- IVAN: Hasta la vista, baby.

597
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,560
GOLDAR: See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya!

598
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,760
Ciao.

599
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,960
See ya later, alligator.

600
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:36,160
Finally, the moment of truth!

601
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,360
Mordant, let the ooze flow!

602
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,760
Comin' right up.

603
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,160
Ooze, give my creatures life!

604
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,360
Life, I tell you! Life!

605
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,360
Excellent!

606
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,560
Now my machines will destroy the city!

607
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,720
ADAM: Wow.

608
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,120
Hey, guys, check this out.

609
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,320
BILLY: lncredible.

610
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,520
Let's go, guys. Nice and easy.

611
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,120
What do you think?

612
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,520
Wait here.

613
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,720
Tommy!

614
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,320
- What now?
- Ninjetti!

615
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,120
- Falcon!
- The frog!

616
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,920
- The ape!
- The crane!

617
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,320
- The wolf!
- Bear!

618
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,920
These things are made of rock.

619
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,720
These guys are strong.

620
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,920
Yikes.

621
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,720
Back off, boulder breath!

622
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,920
Hang tight, Adam!

623
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,720
Ever play leapfrog?

624
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,320
- Adam!
- Hang on, Rocky!

625
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,920
Hey, lava head!

626
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,720
Thanks, Adam. Thought I was finished.

627
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,720
That's one down, and three to go.

628
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,720
Whoa!

629
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,720
Somebody help!

630
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,720
Let's talk about this.

631
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,120
Guess not.

632
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,920
Come on, roll!

633
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,720
Hang on, Kimberly!

634
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,520
They're strong, but they're not too smart.
Help me push.

635
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,720
Right.

636
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,320
KIMBERLY: Let's rock his world.

637
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,920
What is this, pick-on-the-frog day?

638
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,120
- Hey, Adam, could you use a hand?
- The thought crossed my mind.

639
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:32,720
Adam!

640
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,720
Elevator goin' up.

641
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,320
BILLY: Elevator goin' down.

642
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,320
Talk about a splitting headache.

643
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,120
Whoa! That was close.

644
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,120
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

645
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:00,920
Go!

646
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,520
Ninjetti corkscrew kick!

647
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,720
Eightball, corner pocket!

648
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,920
What now?

649
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,920
- Whoa. What's happening?
- TOMMY: Look.

650
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,240
The great power.

651
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,640
The sacred animals.

652
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,240
ROCKY: New Zords!

653
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,440
- We did it!
- Our morphers are on line.

654
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,240
- We got the power!
- Hang on, Zordon!

655
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,640
- We're on our way.
- Let's do it.

656
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,440
DULCEA: Good luck, Rangers.

657
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:46,040
Citizens of Angel Grove,
how do you like my friends, huh?

658
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,640
The boys are back in town!

659
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,760
Long live the King of Ooze!

660
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:21,480
The mayor has declared a state of emergency.

661
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,080
He"s asked that the city
be immediately evacuated.

662
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,480
Angel Grove has never before known...

663
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,680
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai! Ivan's evil machines
are destroying Angel Grove!

664
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,080
Alpha...

665
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,480
keep trying.

666
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,880
TV: Where are the Power Rangers?

667
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,080
I love the smell of destruction in the evening.

668
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,880
Me, too.

669
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,680
What's that smell?

670
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,280
Inconceivable.

671
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,280
The Power Rangers!

672
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,280
- Oh, man! Look at this mess.
- This is lvan's handiwork.

673
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,280
- Let's get back to the command centre.
- Wait. What was that?

674
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,680
I think we're about to find out. Look!

675
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:20,280
- Whoa. What is that thing?
- lvan's been busy while we were away.

676
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:25,080
Whoa!

677
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,480
- What's that?
- AISHA: There's another one.

678
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,880
KIMBERLY: And it's even uglier.

679
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:37,080
- Whoa.
- We've gotta stop these things.

680
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:40,680
- We've got new Ninja Zords. Let's use 'em!
- Right!

681
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,480
Ninja crane Zord!

682
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,280
Ninja wolf Zord!

683
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,480
Ninja frog Zord!

684
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:46,680
Ninja ape Zord!

685
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,680
Ninja bear Zord!

686
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,480
Ninja falcon Zord!

687
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,680
GOLDAR: Uh-oh!

688
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,280
- Check it out!
- Ninja Zords!

689
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:06,480
Cool!

690
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,680
- Yes!
- Awesome!

691
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,680
Oh, no! It's the Zords!

692
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:20,280
Ah, Zords, schmords.
I'll crush 'em like roaches.

693
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,280
- Let's do it!
- Right! Ninja Zords power up!

694
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,680
Ready to ride. Yes!

695
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,280
- All systems on line.
- Activating weapon systems.

696
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,680
- Nice stereo.
- We're outta here!

697
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,880
(parents chanting) Leap to our doom.

698
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,280
Leap to our doom.

699
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,280
Leap to our doom.

700
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,480
# Uh-oh, we're in trouble #

701
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,480
# Something's come along
and it's burst our bubble #

702
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,280
# Yeah, yeah #

703
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,480
Hey, everyone!

704
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:28,080
Listen up! You all think
this is one big party, don't you?

705
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:31,680
- Yeah!
- Well, you've all been brainwashed.

706
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:36,480
Ivan's taking over the planet
and he's using all of us in his plans!

707
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,480
- And he's got our parents.
- What are you talking about?

708
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,880
Look, lvan Ooze is evil.

709
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:47,280
And if you don't come with me right now, our
parents are gonna die! You gotta believe me!

710
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:54,480
TOMMY: Rangers, I'm over the east quadrant.
My sensors are pickin' up a disturbance.

711
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,880
I'm goin' in.

712
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,480
Somebody call for an exterminator?
I've got a lock.

713
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,280
Rockets away!

714
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,480
I've been hit! I'm pullin' out!

715
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:18,480
Don't worry, Tommy, Frog Zord is in position.

716
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:22,080
We got 'em now, boss.

717
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,680
Touch me again,
you'll be chicken wings in the morning.

718
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,680
ADAM: Tongue-tied and twisted.

719
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,480
Yee-hah!

720
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:40,080
Bad move, sparky.
You play with fire, you're gonna get burned.

721
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,880
- I need backup!
- BILLY: l"m on my way!

722
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,280
Wolf Zord approaching target.
Keep him tied up. I'm loading hydraulics.

723
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,280
ADAM: I'm losin' him!

724
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,080
Here goes!

725
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,680
All right! Got him.

726
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,680
Time to boogie with the bear.

727
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,480
Whoa!

728
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,880
I've been hit hard!

729
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,080
Ape Zord locked on target.

730
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,680
Yee-hah!

731
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,080
Ride 'em, cowboy!

732
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,280
- Hang in there, Rocky!
- I'm hangin'! I'm hangin'!

733
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,480
FRED: Come on! We'll take the monorail!

734
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,480
Let's get down to the construction site!

735
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,080
All right, guys,
I've got a lock on the ooze man.

736
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:02,880
Ah!

737
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,880
Here comes that cute
little Pink Ranger to the rescue.

738
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,480
Oh, you think she's cute too, huh?

739
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,280
(lvan growls)

740
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:15,480
- One order of toasted slime comin' up.
- So, you wanna play, huh?

741
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,880
Ivan's got me in an electromagnetic deadlock!
I can't break free!

742
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,280
TOMMY: Hang on, Kimberly!

743
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,480
I'm getting airsick up here!

744
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:34,080
My stabilisers have ruptured!
I can't hold on much longer!

745
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,480
- I'm burning up in here!
- AISHA: Kimberly, use your thrusters!

746
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,880
Right! Now, which button?

747
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:44,880
Aaaaaggghhh!

748
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,480
- I'll deal with you later.
- Yeah, later.

749
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,080
Ah. Oozed.

750
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,080
I'm losing my grip!
I can't hold on much longer!

751
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:10,680
Falcon Zord is back in the game.
Adam, disengage. I've got a clear shot!

752
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,480
He's all yours.

753
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:16,080
All right, big guy, it's lights out for you.

754
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,680
Rockets away!

755
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,680
- He's outta there!
- Target neutralised. Let's get the other one.

756
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,880
He's too strong! I can't take him down!

757
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,880
Everybody close in. This street's a dead end.

758
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,080
IVAN: They've destroyed
my beautiful creation.

759
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:59,880
Now I'm beginning to get really angry!

760
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,880
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

761
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,680
IVAN: I feel big again!

762
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,680
Go get 'em, booger man!

763
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:26,280
Whoa. Somebody call a plastic surgeon.

764
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,080
Oh, no!

765
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,880
I'm outta here!

766
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,480
Time for a little swordplay.

767
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,640
- He destroyed the monorail track.
- We need Ninja Megazord power now!

768
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,640
Ninja Megazord, power up!

769
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,440
Monorail's in trouble.
I'll complete docking sequence later.

770
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,840
KIMBERLY: We"ll take care of lvan.

771
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,440
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

772
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,440
# Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #

773
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,240
Crane Zord locked on.

774
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,040
Checking out.

775
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,440
Ninja battle mode now!

776
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,640
- Activating Ninja Megazord battle mode.
- Power Sword, now!

777
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,040
Shall we tango?

778
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,440
- Oh, no.
- What is that?

779
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,840
- The track's broken!
- Oh, no!

780
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,640
Hang on, kids.

781
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,240
- Falcon Zord is comin' in for a landin'.
- Everybody hang on!

782
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,240
All right! Yeah! Whoo!

783
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,840
Good luck, kids.

784
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,640
Power Sword has been destroyed.

785
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,640
- Pressure's dropping!
- Negative control!

786
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:27,840
- Tommy, we need your help!
- Hang tight, guys. I'm on my way.

787
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,440
- Everybody hang on!
- IVAN: Next stop, Angel Grove First National.

788
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,640
Whoaaa!

789
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,440
ADAM: Brace for impact!

790
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,440
- All systems down!
- He's closing in!

791
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,640
- Tommy, get your butt down here!
- Comin' in to complete the sequence.

792
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,240
Ninja Falcon Megazord!

793
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:03,240
Let's get Ooze outta here
before he destroys everything.

794
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,640
- I'll set a course for outer space.
- Good idea.

795
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,840
Let's do it!

796
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,640
You can run, but you can't hide.

797
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,640
Yee-hah!

798
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,280
(chanting) Leap to our doom.

799
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,480
Leap to our doom.

800
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,480
Leap to our doom.

801
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,480
Leap to our doom.

802
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,280
It's our parents!

803
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:04,880
You guys try and stop them.
And you two come with me.

804
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:22,280
- Guys, I think I know a way to get rid of lvan.
- Really? How?

805
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,680
- Ryan's Comet.
- Billy, that's brilliant!

806
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,080
- What?
- We get lvan in the comet's path...

807
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,480
And kaboom! He's space dust.

808
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,880
- All right, guys, main thrusters.
- Right!

809
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,480
- We can't hold 'em back!
- We have to keep on trying!

810
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,880
Turn it on!

811
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:30,080
Well, if it isn't that
double-dealing dough head!

812
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:34,280
I hope those Rangers
put that lousy lowlife out of my misery!

813
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,880
- Go, Rangers! Go, Rangers!
- Go, Rangers! Go, Rangers!

814
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,480
We're approaching the comet's coordinates.

815
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,080
All right, guys, this is it.
We'll wait here and lure him in.

816
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:48,080
I'm gonna rip you apart Zord by Zord.

817
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,680
TOMMY: Here he comes. Brace yourselves!

818
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,680
(lvan laughs)

819
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,480
- Micropressure's in the red!
- We're imploding!

820
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,480
Bearing 009. We're in the comet's trajectory.

821
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,680
We need to break free.

822
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:09,680
IVAN: Have you hugged your Zords today?

823
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:15,680
- Here it comes!
- We have to break his grip!

824
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,680
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

825
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:22,280
- What are you doing?
- Taking care of business.

826
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,880
- We're outta here.
- Right!

827
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,480
Oh, no.

828
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,080
Yeah.

829
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,480
- Skull!
- Bulk...

830
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,280
Dad!

831
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:13,280
- Fred!
- Dad!

832
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,680
I love you, son.

833
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,520
Alpha!

834
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,520
Rangers, you made it!

835
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:41,120
But... I'm afraid you're too late.

836
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,520
BILLY: Too late?

837
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,520
This can't be happening.

838
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,320
Remember what we learnt?

839
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:23,720
To those who possess the great power,
all things are possible.

840
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:32,120
Come on.

841
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:45,320
Zordon!

842
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:47,120
Rangers!

843
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,120
He's alive! He's alive! He's alive!

844
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:54,320
- We thought that you had...
- It is good to see you again, too.

845
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,600
( # The Power" by Snap )

846
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,000
- SKULL: We were awesome.
- BULK: lncredible!

847
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,000
Ivan and his 50-foot monsters
had us surrounded.

848
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,600
- There was no escape.
- We knew we were facing death in the eye.

849
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,200
- We could smell death's breath.
- And death could use a mint.

850
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,000
Can you believe those guys?

851
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,000
I'm so hungry.

852
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,400
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Fred!

853
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,600
- Hey! Rumour has it you're quite the hero.
- That's my man!

854
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,200
I helped a bit.
The Power Rangers did most of the work.

855
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:36,000
Hey, things got tough, you didn't panic.
You, my friend, demonstrated true bravery.

856
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,200
It's like what you taught me about martial
arts: use your head, and above all, stay calm.

857
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,800
I heard you're in line to be
a Ranger yourself one of these days.

858
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:48,600
- Nah, that's impossible.
- Hey, anything's possible.

859
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,600
- You really think so?
- I know so.

860
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:58,200
- Fred Kelman, the Silver Ranger.
- It does have a certain ring to it.

861
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,400
Fred Kelman the Gold Ranger.

862
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,800
Check it out!

863
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
# We'll get higher and higher #

864
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,800
# Straight up we'll climb #

865
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
# We'll get higher and higher #

866
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:21,000
# Leave it all behind #

867
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:26,400
# So, baby, dry your eyes #

868
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,400
- All right!
- I don't believe it.

869
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,000
- Power Rangers?
- Bulk and Skull!

870
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:39,600
# Cos we belong #

871
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,600
# In a world that must be strong #

872
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:48,120
# Oh, that's what dreams are made of #

873
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:55,920
# Oh, that's what dreams are made of #

874
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,920
I am King Goldar,

875
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:40,920
the ruler of the universe!

876
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,320
Uh-oh.

877
