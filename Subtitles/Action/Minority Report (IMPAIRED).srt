rate had reached epidemic proportions.

152
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,300
It seemed that only a miracle
could stop the bloodshed.

153
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,600
But instead of one miracle, we
were given three: the Pre-Cognitives.

154
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,400
Within just one month
under the Precrime program...

155
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,100
... the murder rate in the District
of Columbia was reduced 90%.

-They were waiting for me.
-He was gonna rape me.

-I was going to be stabbed.
-Right here.

158
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,800
NARRATOR: Precrime effectively
stopped murder in our nation 's capital.

159
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
In the six years of our experiment...

160
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,700
... there hasn 't been a single murder.

NARRATOR:
And now Precrime can work for you.

162
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,000
We want to make certain
that every American...

of the system.

00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:34,700
If the consequences of severaI genetic
mistakes and science gone haywire...

596
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,700
...can be caIIed an invention,
then I invented Precrime.

597
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,800
-You don't seem proud.
-I'm not.

598
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,900
I was trying to heaI them,
not turn them into something eIse.

599
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,900
-HeaI who?
-The innocents we use to stop the guiIty.

600
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:49,100
You're taIking about the Pre-Cogs.

601
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:54,300
You think they came from a test tube?
They are mereIy the ones who survived.

602
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,100
I was doing genetic research,
treating chiIdren of drug addicts.

603
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,800
This was 1 0 years ago,
when neuroin first hit the streets.

604
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
It was impure, not the engineered
cocktaiI popuIar among the educated.

605
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:14,400
AII of these kids were born with severe
brain damage. Most died before age 1 2.

606
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,200
Those few who survived,
they had a gift.

607
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,500
I caII it a gift. For them,
it was more Iike a cosmic joke.

608
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,400
They wouId wake up in the night,
curIed in the corner...

609
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,400
...screaming, cIawing at the waIIs.

610
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,800
Because when these chiIdren
cIosed their eyes at night...

611
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,200
...they dreamt onIy of murder
over and over, one after the other.

612
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,800
It didn't take for us Iong to reaIize
that the reaI nightmare was...

613
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,800
...that these dreams were about to come
true, these murders were happening.

614
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,800
You say some of the chiIdren died?

615
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,100
So many of them.
Despite what we did for them.

616
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:56,400
Or maybe because of what we
did to them. But it doesn't matter.

617
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,300
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

618
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,400
ANDERTON:
I'm not going to commit murder.

619
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,900
I've never met the man
I'm supposed to kiII.

620
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:09,200
And yet a chain of events has started
that wiII Iead you to his murder.

621
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,000
-Not if I stay away from him.
-Can you avoid a man you've never met?

622
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,100
-You won't heIp?
-I can't heIp you. Nobody can.

623
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,000
The Pre-Cogs are never wrong.

624
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,300
But occasionaIIy...

625
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,800
...they do disagree.

626
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,400
What?

627
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:32,100
Most of the time, aII three Pre-Cogs
wiII see an event in the same way...

628
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,900
...but once in a whiIe, one of them wiII
see things differentIy than the others.

629
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,100
Jesus Christ.
Why didn't I know about this?

630
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,900
Because these Minority Reports
are destroyed the instant they occur.

631
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,200
Why?

632
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:50,100
For Precrime to function, there can't
be any suggestion of faIIibiIity.

633
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,300
Who wants a justice system
that instiIIs doubt?

634
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,300
It may be reasonabIe,
but it's stiII doubt.

635
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,200
Are you saying
I've haIoed innocent peopIe?

636
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,100
I'm saying that every so often,
those accused of a Precrime...

637
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,700
...just might have
an aIternate future.

638
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,700
Does Burgess know about this,
about this Minority Report?

639
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,300
I used to joke with Lamar that
we were the parents of Precrime.

640
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,000
Parents often see their chiIdren as they
want them to be and not as they are.

641
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,000
Answer my question: Does Lamar
Burgess know about the Minority Report?

642
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,000
Yes, of course, he knew.

643
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:31,200
But at the time, we feIt their existence
was an insignificant variabIe.

644
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,300
Insignificant to you, maybe.

645
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:37,100
But what about those peopIe that
I put away with aIternate futures?

646
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,900
-My God, if the country knew--
-The system wouId coIIapse.

647
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,300
-I beIieve in that system.
-Do you reaIIy?

648
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,000
You wanna bring it down.

649
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,900
You wiII bring it down
if you manage to kiII your victim.

650
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:55,900
That'II be the most spectacuIar pubIic
dispIay of how Precrime didn't work.

651
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,000
-I'm not gonna kiII anybody.
-HoId that thought.

652
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,400
-Why shouId I trust you?
-You shouIdn't trust anyone.

CertainIy not the attorney generaI,
who wants it aII for himseIf.

And not the young federaI agent,
who wants your job.

655
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:12,800
Not even the oId man who just wants
to hang on to what he created.

656
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,900
Don't trust anyone.
Just find the Minority Report.

657

You said the Minority Report
is destroyed.

658
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:23,400
The record is destroyed.
The originaI report stiII exists.

659
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:28,600
I designed it so the report is stored
in a safe pIace, but not decIared.

660
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,000
What safe pIace is that?

661

is downIoad it, darIing.

888
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,900
And now, nine years Iater,
D.C. is the safest city in America.

889
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:45,300
-Get down.
-Why? Because Precrime works.

890
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,600
Precrime has eIiminated the need
for conventionaI detectives.

891
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:53,400
What happens now is the verification
and protection of future victims.

892
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,100
Can we see the Pre-Cogs?

893
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:59,600
They have such a powerfuI gift,
they're kept in peacefuI secIusion...

894
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,700
...so as not to be distracted.

895
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:06,100
This dispIay shouId give you some idea
of what their daiIy Iife is Iike.

896
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:10,100
The Pre-Cogs get over
8 miIIion Ietters every year.

897
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,600
CHILDREN: Wow!
-That's more than Santa CIaus gets.

898
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,300
Each Pre-Cog has their own bedroom,
TV and weight room.

899
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,500
It's wonderfuI to be a Pre-Cog.

900
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,400
My mom's new boyfriend
came over again Iast night.

901
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,700
He's just not very inteIIigent.

902
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:53,500
My mom wouIdn't Iet me eat upstairs.
I had to Iisten to him go on and on.

But she thinks I'II be irresponsibIe.
It's ridicuIous because...

Easy there, oId-timer.

-Listen, WaIIy.

-Do I know you?
-I Iike you.

912

So I don't wanna have
to kick you or hit you.

He's coming here to get her.

Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.

920

They don't come out in any order.
I'm getting them as she's giving them.

-He has some kind of mask on.

-He seaIed the door.
-Shit!

924
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,200
Nobody fires a weapon inside
the tempIe. Use bindfoam.

-Is there another way out of there?
-AII the doors are covered.

No! No! No! No! No!

928

WITWER:
What does he want with a Pre-Cog?

929
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,800
So he can kiII whoever he wants to
without anyone knowing.

WeII, there's stiII the other two.
The other two can stiII function, right?

931
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:44,200
They're a hive mind. It takes aII three
for their predictive abiIities to work.

932

They can't see murders anymore?

933

Agatha, she's the key.
She's the one they Iisten to...

01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:23,800
Yes. This is from the twins,
Arthur and DashieII.

1188
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,200
Agatha's stream was missing.

1189
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:30,100
This one is from the Cyber ParIor.

1190
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:35,200
Anderton downIoaded this directIy
from Agatha. Rufus RiIey recorded it.

1191
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:41,300
-It's the same prevision.
-Not quite.

1192
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:47,200
Look at the surface wind
across the water. Watch the rippIes.

1193
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,300
Moving away from shore.

1194
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:56,100
Now the second image, the one from
Containment that Art and Dash saw.

1195
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:58,300
Watch the water.

1196
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:04,300
The wind's changed.
The rippIes are moving the other way.

1197
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,800
This murder's taking pIace
at two different times.

1198
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:12,400
Anderton was watching this
right before he was tagged.

1199
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:15,500
He toId me about
the missing data stream.

1200
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:19,300
-He was concerned you might find it.
-He was right. I did.

1201
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:21,100
It was inside of Agatha.

1202
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:26,100
So the question is, why wouId someone
want this erased from the data fiIe?

1203
01:47:26,300 --> 01:47:30,400
Danny, just teII me
what you're thinking.

1204
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:33,400
I'm thinking someone
got away with murder.

1205
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,200
How?

1206
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:39,900
Jad toId me that sometimes the Pre-Cogs
see the same murder more than once.

1207
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,700
-It's caIIed an echo.
-Jad caIIed it Pre-Cog déjà vu.

1208
01:47:43,900 --> 01:47:47,400
We teach the techs to identify
and disregard them.

1209
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:52,900
Yeah, but what if a technician onIy
thought he was Iooking at an echo?

1210
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:57,600
What if he was Iooking at a compIeteIy
different murder aItogether?

1211
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:59,400
I don't understand.

1212
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,800
AII you'd have to do is hire someone
to kiII Anne LiveIy...

1213
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,500
...Iike a drifter, a neuroin addict,
someone with nothing to Iose.

1214
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:08,500
Precrime stops the murder
from taking pIace...

1215
01:48:08,600 --> 01:48:13,300
...haIoes the kiIIer, takes him away.
But then, right then, someone eIse...

1216
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,400
...having reviewed the prevision
and dressed in the same cIothes...

1217
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:21,200
...commits the murder
in exactIy the same way.

1218
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:26,600
Technician takes a Iook, thinks he's
Iooking at an echo, erases it.

1219
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:35,500
It'd have to be someone with access
to the previsions in the first pIace.

1220
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:37,700
-Someone fairIy high-up.
-Shh.

1221
01:48:39,800 --> 01:48:41,700
Do you know what I hear?

1222
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:46,600
Nothing.
No footsteps up the stairs.

1223
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:50,900
No hovercraft out the window.
No cIickety-cIick of IittIe spyders.

1224
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,400
Do you know why?

1225
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:55,900
Because right now,
the Pre-Cogs can't see a thing.

to have those.
