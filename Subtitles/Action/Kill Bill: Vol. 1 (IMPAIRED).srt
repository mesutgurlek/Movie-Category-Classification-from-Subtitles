But still...

823
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:49,820
But still nothing.

824
01:39:51,070 --> 01:39:54,410
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

825
01:39:54,490 --> 01:39:57,990
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.

826
01:39:58,490 --> 01:40:01,370
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

827
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:04,540
The first reason is information.

828
01:40:04,630 --> 01:40:07,420
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blond!

829
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:09,170
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blond!
I'll tell you nothing.

830
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:14,800
But I am gonna ask you questions.

831
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:18,810
And every time
you don't give me answers,

832
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:21,980
I'm gonna cut something off.

833
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:28,230
And I promise you,
they will be things you will miss!

834
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,900
- Give me your other arm!
- [Screaming]

835
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:38,280
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

836
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:39,580
[BILL]
If you had to guess...

837
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:40,620
[THE BRIDE]
What they've been doing.

838
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:41,870
[BILL]
Why she left you alive...

839
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:43,830
[THE BRIDE]
And where I can find them.

840
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:46,290
[BILL]
What would be your guess?

841
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:50,710
Guessing won't be necessary.

842
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,050
She informed me.

843
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:59,260
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

844
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:01,220
[THE BRIDE]
As I said before,

845
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:06,060
I've allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons.

846
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:11,440
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,

847
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:14,570
everything that happened
here tonight.

848
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:18,780
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

849
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:22,160
by witnessing
your deformed body.

850
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:26,580
I want you to tell him all the
information you just told me.

851
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:29,590
I want him to know what I know.

852
01:41:29,670 --> 01:41:33,960
I want him to know
I want him to know.

853
01:41:34,050 --> 01:41:36,300
And I want them all to know

854
01:41:36,380 --> 01:41:42,640
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

855
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:11,500
Revenge is never a straight line.

856
01:42:14,460 --> 01:42:16,420
It's a forest.

857
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:20,340
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...

858
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,720
...to get lost... to forget where you came in.

859
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:32,480
That woman deserves her revenge.

860
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:41,570
And we deserve to die.

861
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:48,870
She must suffer
to her last breath.

862
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:03,970
How did you find me?

863
01:43:04,810 --> 01:43:06,720
[BILL]
I'm the man.

864
01:43:10,350 --> 01:43:13,060
One more thing, Sofie.

865
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:18,820
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?
