1
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,035
{Explosion}

2
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:47,820
{Newscasters overlapping}
You know the economy is going
to crash. That's why I'm here.

3
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,421
The problem is
the bail-out plan.

4
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:50,923
It's only going to make the
problem worse

5
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:52,224
and exacerbate things.

6
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:54,193
The politicians have
to resist the urge...

7
00:01:54,194 --> 00:01:55,861
Coast Guard and environment
cleanup organizations

8
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:57,229
are working overtime

9
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,749
to clean up the disastrous
53,000-gallon spill

10
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,384
that left over 30 miles
of pristine coastline

11
00:02:02,385 --> 00:02:03,952
soaked with sludge and oil.

12
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:06,855
It's still unclear how long it
will take to clean up this mess

13
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:09,257
and what long-term effects it
will have on the environment...

14
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:10,759
We need to do
something fast.

15
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,694
Adjustable rate mortgages
have already done enough damage

16
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:13,962
and we have not seen
anything yet.

17
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:18,300
{Sirens}

18
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,864
...just like President Richard
Nixon did to the Vietnamese

19
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:33,014
back in the late '60s...

20
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:35,183
Osama bin Laden,
al Qaeda,

21
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:37,119
these people are out
to kill us. People don't--

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,887
All of these things
contribute to

23
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:41,824
the problem
of overpopulation...

24
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:43,108
People don't comprehend
the danger

25
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:45,761
that this country
creates for the world...

26
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:48,563
If just 15 millilitres is
released and becomes airborne,

27
00:02:48,564 --> 00:02:50,031
this chemical could kill
a million people...

28
00:02:50,032 --> 00:02:52,551
Oil is not only one
of the reasons,

29
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:55,019
but the main reason
to go to war in Iraq,

30
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,255
despite what federal
governments are saying.

31
00:02:57,256 --> 00:02:59,090
Thousands of Australian
troops have been sent--

32
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:01,125
As mentioned in that story,

33
00:03:01,126 --> 00:03:03,228
the soaring prices of oil is
a world-wide problem...

34
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:06,148
Efforts to reduce emissions
and pollution are required

35
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:09,451
immediately to reduce the
effects of global warming.

36
00:03:09,452 --> 00:03:10,802
If we do not react soon...

37
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,575
Monetary policy allows
American citizens

38
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:18,142
to borrow trillions of dollars

39
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:19,343
without the ability to
pay any of the money back...

40
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:20,845
What were the beachgoers
thinking

41
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:22,948
when they left ten tons of
garbage behind on the beach

42
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:25,016
this Labour Day weekend?
The bottom line is...

43
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:26,918
The shooting happened in a
supermarket parking lot

44
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,020
in broad daylight with
dozens of people around.

45
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,155
Yeah, I couldn't believe it.
I was shocked.

46
00:03:31,156 --> 00:03:32,958
I was just standing there,
and he came up shooting.

47
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,410
I saw him fall...

48
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:38,180
He's killed
a lot of people here.

49
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:42,700
{TV broadcasts overlapping}

50
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:55,914
Bill, are you up?
Come and have breakfast.

51
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:59,484
TV:
Beautiful woman's ring,
straight out of Africa.

52
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:03,855
Retails at $699.99...

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,327
Hey, darling.

54
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:10,895
Hey, honey.
How are you doing?

55
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:11,880
Did you sleep okay?

56
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:14,449
I did. You were
a tiger last night.

57
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:17,452
Oh, did you put
milk out already?

58
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:19,454
Yeah.
Okay.

59
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:20,856
I want to see if there's a
mirror I can--

60
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:22,624
Hey, honey. How are you doing?

61
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,625
Good.

62
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:24,760
Oh, you've already got
everything.

63
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:26,494
Sweetheart, you're
taking care of business.

64
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,729
That's fantastic.

65
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,964
I've got your coffee.
Let's move things along.

66
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:30,532
Sweetie, I just want to mention

67
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:33,001
that these should have
been put away, okay?

68
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:35,704
I mean,
you've got to chip in.

69
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:37,706
I thought I--
I thought I did that.

70
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:47,348
Okay, but find
a way that's not--

71
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:49,350
because you know what--

72
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:53,288
I don't want to do this
on a rush,

73
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:54,723
because it's an important thing.

74
00:04:54,724 --> 00:04:57,225
But your mother and I were
talking last night.

75
00:04:57,226 --> 00:05:01,129
We didn't get a lot of sleep--
not for the reason you think.

76
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,465
That's gross.

77
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:06,835
We think it's time you
moved on and moved out.

78
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:10,271
Fuck!

79
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:11,272
Oh, don't worry about it.

80
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:12,273
Okay.

81
00:05:12,274 --> 00:05:13,274
I'll get a napkin.

82
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:15,310
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:18,313
Help your father.

84
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:19,414
You got it, Dad?

85
00:05:19,415 --> 00:05:21,783
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

86
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:23,184
Sorry, Mom.

87
00:05:23,185 --> 00:05:24,285
No, it's okay.

88
00:05:24,286 --> 00:05:26,521
But it's just that,
look, you're 23...

89
00:05:26,522 --> 00:05:28,223
You've got to get your
own place, right?

90
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:29,591
I know. You keep saying that.

91
00:05:29,592 --> 00:05:30,859
You just spilt more on me.

92
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,960
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:34,462
But you-- I know you
guys keep saying that.

94
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:35,664
Sorry.

95
00:05:35,665 --> 00:05:38,834
You keep saying that,
but it takes time,

96
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:41,737
because I have to, obviously,
raise the money

97
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:46,008
for my own post-education,
right?

98
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:49,978
So the deal was is that
I would do that by own,

99
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,813
do my best to
save up that money.

100
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:54,883
In the meantime,
I would stay with you guys.

101
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:57,452
How about putting some of that
money into some rent?

102
00:05:57,453 --> 00:05:59,237
What did I do last month?

103
00:05:59,238 --> 00:06:01,072
We talked about the fridge.

104
00:06:01,073 --> 00:06:02,874
Remember, when you
first suggested it?

105
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,159
I said I didn't--
Honey, what did--

106
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,178
And then you said that that
would buy me some--

107
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:09,915
That's a classic guilt trip by
the way, and I appreciate that.

108
00:06:09,916 --> 00:06:11,315
No, but he did say--

109
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:13,284
I know what you're doing.
You learned from the best.

110
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:14,653
If you guys want me
to go back to school,

111
00:06:14,654 --> 00:06:16,655
then obviously I have to have a
little bit of money

112
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:18,790
to do that too.

113
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,726
Look, honestly, Bill,
you don't want to be the--

114
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:22,961
We shouldn't have
gotten into it now,

115
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:24,462
because you and I--
we have to go.

116
00:06:24,463 --> 00:06:26,330
Yeah.

117
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,398
I'm just saying--
I'm just saying, okay--

118
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,000
Five o'clock, mister,

119
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:31,085
we're going to have
a roundtable discussion.

120
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:32,687
Do me a favour.

121
00:06:32,688 --> 00:06:34,288
Do me a favour. Do me a favour.

122
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,007
--you guys need to
help me out a little.

123
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:37,025
Give me a call at work.
Give me a call at work.

124
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:39,027
We're going to-- we're going to
have a bite to eat.

125
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:40,495
We'll grab some lunch.

126
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:41,630
We'll grab a newspaper.

127
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:43,231
We'll go look at some
apartments,

128
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:45,534
and we'll have you in a new
place by the end of the week.

129
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:49,204
Okay, just as long as you're
paying for the lunch, because--

130
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:50,905
Wow, man.

131
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:52,541
Now, you guys.

132
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,377
You can push each other's
buttons like no one,

133
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:57,579
birds of a feather.

134
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,683
I'm fine. I thought we had a
good situation, but obviously--

135
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:05,019
We have a good situation.
But let's not make it a bad one.

136
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,454
That's what we're saying.

137
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:08,022
We're going to help you out
for the first--

138
00:07:08,023 --> 00:07:09,558
for the first couple
of years, okay?

139
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:11,359
We will help you out.

140
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm not saying that we're
going to pay 100 percent,

141
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:14,195
but we will help you out.

142
00:07:14,196 --> 00:07:16,131
Okay, here's what
we're going to do.

143
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:18,033
We're going to meet here. I'm
going to pick up some pizzas,

144
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:19,867
and then we're going to sit
and have a nice discussion.

145
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:21,236
But I have to go.

146
00:07:21,237 --> 00:07:22,703
I mean, if you guys are willing
to help me out, I'm cool.

147
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:23,971
Yeah.

148
00:07:23,972 --> 00:07:25,440
Okay?
Yeah.

149
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:26,807
We still love you, man.
It's not to, you know--

150
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:29,110
I know.

151
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:30,678
Okay, have a good one today.
Okay?

152
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:31,746
Okay.

153
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:32,747
Give me a call at work.

154
00:07:32,748 --> 00:07:34,249
Be safe.

155
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,601
{Radio chattering}

156
00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:35,760
There you go, enjoy.

157
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:36,894
Hey, how are you doing?

158
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:38,163
Good, man.

159
00:08:38,164 --> 00:08:40,298
A double espresso macchiato
with extra foam.

160
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,134
Sure, that will be $4.50.

161
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:48,757
There you go.
Thanks, man.

162
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,496
Extra foam, man.

163
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:57,382
You got it.

164
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:05,440
There you go.

165
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:07,542
That's not what I ordered, man.

166
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:09,311
Yeah, it is.

167
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:12,180
That's not a macchiato.
There's no foam in there at all.

168
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,581
Yeah, there is.
There's some right there.

169
00:09:13,582 --> 00:09:14,749
No, no, no.

170
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,584
No, a lot of foam,
a lot of foam.

171
00:09:16,585 --> 00:09:19,320
Dude, look,
this is like half milk.

172
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:20,722
That's not a macchiato.

173
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:22,724
Look, there's--
there's foam in there.

174
00:09:26,294 --> 00:09:27,595
There you go, more foam.

175
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:29,898
Yeah, but take-- take some of
the milk out of it, man.

176
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:30,965
I'm not taking any
of the milk out.

177
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:33,234
That's a perfectly good
macchiato.

178
00:09:33,235 --> 00:09:34,368
Give me back my money, man.

179
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:35,369
I'm not giving you--

180
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,404
Give me back my money.

181
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:37,839
I'm not giving you
your money back.

182
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,273
Just take your coffee.

183
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:40,875
I'm not paying for something
that I didn't order, man.

184
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:42,010
Give me back my money.

185
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:43,745
I make the best
coffees in this town.

186
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:44,879
Take your coffee and go.

187
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,480
I don't give a f--
what you make, bro.

188
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:48,433
But I didn't-- I didn't order
this, so I don't want it.

189
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:49,834
I don't care.

190
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:51,369
That's a good coffee.
Take it.

191
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,539
You know, just take it and shove
it up your ass, all right?

192
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:01,963
Fucking idiot, man.

193
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:10,788
Hey, man, you don't want
to give me back my $4.50?

194
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:13,675
You don't want to give
me back my $4.50?

195
00:10:13,676 --> 00:10:14,676
No.

196
00:10:14,677 --> 00:10:15,677
No?

197
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:17,679
No.

198
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:20,415
All right, man.

199
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:22,149
Here, take a--

200
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,386
take a fucking roll while you're
going out the door.

201
00:10:29,174 --> 00:10:30,408
Fuck.

202
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:33,311
{Radio chattering}

203
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:52,847
Bill!

204
00:10:52,848 --> 00:10:54,649
Bill!

205
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,650
Bill!

206
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,587
Bill!
Yeah, what?

207
00:10:59,588 --> 00:11:01,739
Come on. Your lunch has been
over like 15 minutes ago.

208
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,424
What do you mean? I took my
lunch break 15 minutes ago.

209
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:06,478
Bill, take the mask off.
I've got tons of cars in there,

210
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:09,314
and you're wasting
time on this van?

211
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:11,282
All right?

212
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:12,166
I already finished
three cars today, Jim.

213
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:14,469
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Three cars?

214
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,973
Come on. Get in there.

215
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:20,341
Okay, the clock says work, work.

216
00:11:20,342 --> 00:11:22,510
Okay, you should check
your clocks, though.

217
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:24,695
Maybe I should clock you, eh?

218
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:32,436
I don't think you should treat
your best worker like that, Jim.

219
00:11:32,437 --> 00:11:33,704
Bill, just get in there and make
some money for us, okay?

220
00:11:33,705 --> 00:11:35,857
How about a raise?

221
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:37,125
Yeah, Bill?
Why don't you fuck off?

222
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:38,126
Nine bucks.

223
00:11:38,127 --> 00:11:40,061
Yeah, nine bucks.

224
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:02,766
That's it, yeah. Right.

225
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:04,768
It's all prepped and ready.

226
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,405
RADIO:
The stresses from war do not
make a man do this.

227
00:12:24,406 --> 00:12:28,092
What makes a man do this are
shame and rage.

228
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:30,211
{Singing}
What do you do when
the sun sets?

229
00:12:30,212 --> 00:12:32,480
Gonne get down
when the sun sets.

230
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:33,648
Yeah!

231
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:35,683
Late.

232
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:38,152
Sorry, I'm late.

233
00:12:38,153 --> 00:12:40,555
The funniest thing is that you
and this piece of shit--

234
00:12:40,556 --> 00:12:42,757
only you would do a burn out

235
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:44,125
coming into a
shit hole like this.

236
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:45,827
Yeah, it's $300.

237
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:48,579
I know you've got to work for
six months to make that, but...

238
00:12:50,032 --> 00:12:53,201
Hey, I got you a present.

239
00:12:53,202 --> 00:12:54,436
Why? What the fuck, man?

240
00:12:54,437 --> 00:12:55,803
Read up.

241
00:12:55,804 --> 00:12:57,939
Listen, by the way, you've got
to stop having these things

242
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,140
sent to my fucking house, man.

243
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:00,908
Yes, these are
the last ones, man.

244
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:02,843
Yeah, but my dad
is getting pissed, okay?

245
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:04,946
And what the fuck is in this?

246
00:13:04,947 --> 00:13:06,647
What did he say?

247
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:08,316
He was asking what it was.

248
00:13:08,317 --> 00:13:10,017
What did you tell him?

249
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:11,419
To mind his own
fucking business.

250
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,855
Good, good.

251
00:13:14,856 --> 00:13:16,774
No one can know.
It's a surprise.

252
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:18,475
Piece of shit.
Watch your head.

253
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:24,165
Fuck. Yeah!

254
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,866
Let's go eat.

255
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:27,535
Do you really want
to fucking eat

256
00:13:27,536 --> 00:13:29,070
in this shit hole Chicken Den
piece of shit?

257
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:32,457
This is America, man.
This is what we eat, okay?

258
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,458
I love it.

259
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:34,692
Dude, Chicken Den?

260
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:35,793
Do you know what they do with
these animals?

261
00:13:35,794 --> 00:13:37,094
It's all-American.
This is America, baby.

262
00:13:37,095 --> 00:13:38,312
They sit in cages,
sitting in their shit all day.

263
00:13:38,313 --> 00:13:41,832
You're such a fucking prick.

264
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:42,966
How are you doing?

265
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:44,735
Welcome to Chicken Den.
How may I help you?

266
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,537
Give me, uh...

267
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:49,106
Give me the four-piece,

268
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:50,608
a four-piece mixed meat.

269
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:51,609
Do you want the combo?

270
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,077
Combo.

271
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:56,781
Fuck.

272
00:13:56,782 --> 00:14:01,385
A salad, a garden salad.

273
00:14:01,386 --> 00:14:03,054
A four-piece combo?
Hi, sorry.

274
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:04,588
A four-piece combo,
you said?

275
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:05,723
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

276
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:08,143
You're just going to have salad?

277
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,678
Draw cartoon chickens
saying, "Eat me."

278
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,979
$10.70, please.

279
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,980
Yes, ma'am.

280
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:22,056
How is your day, love?

281
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:23,891
Perfect. How is yours?

282
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:26,377
Sunshine and rainbows.

283
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:32,116
A combo and a salad.

284
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:33,685
She seem a little bit
pissed off, huh?

285
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,553
Yeah.
Thank you.

286
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:36,554
High-five.

287
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:37,922
Don't leave me hanging.

288
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:42,961
This is a fresh, fresh salad.

289
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:45,296
I'll bet they went out and
picked it this morning.

290
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:48,999
That looks disgusting.

291
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,735
Your salad probably has bugs
crawling all over it.

292
00:14:51,736 --> 00:14:54,838
Dude, move this.

293
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,006
You're going to knock
it off the fucking edge.

294
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:57,708
So tomorrow, 1:00.

295
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:59,043
Yeah. Tomorrow, 1:00.

296
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:00,611
Paintball, right?
No problems with work?

297
00:15:00,612 --> 00:15:02,447
Dude, I've got to call in sick.

298
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:03,681
You haven't done that yet?

299
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:06,284
Well, dude, I have
to call it on the day.

300
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:07,751
I'm not going to
call today and say,

301
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:09,853
"Listen, tomorrow I'm not going
to be in, because I'm sick."

302
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:12,090
I talked to you about
this two weeks ago.

303
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:13,657
Yeah, I have to call in
tomorrow.

304
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:15,059
I said, you said--

305
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,860
Can I have the tray?

306
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:18,496
I took the day off work too.
We have to play.

307
00:15:18,497 --> 00:15:20,932
Holy shit!

308
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,934
Crap!

309
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,838
Would you get me a napkin?

310
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,006
Like, she didn't even say
anything.

311
00:15:29,007 --> 00:15:30,241
She didn't go, "I'm sorry."

312
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:31,458
No like, "I'm sorry."

313
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:33,661
Hi!
You brought napkins.

314
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:36,297
No, no. We'll probably need
like-- I don't know-- a mop.

315
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:37,531
Are you going to apologize?

316
00:15:37,532 --> 00:15:39,000
I mean, you fucking got
this shit all over us.

317
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:40,435
Look, I'm sorry.

318
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:41,602
I'm laughing because you got it
on him, and he's a prick.

319
00:15:41,603 --> 00:15:43,637
Could you
get me more chicken,

320
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:44,772
because this is right
all over the place.

321
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:45,707
Yeah, I'll make that.

322
00:15:45,708 --> 00:15:46,824
What's your problem?

323
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:47,825
I don't have a problem.
I'm sorry.

324
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:49,276
Is there something
wrong with you?

325
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:50,428
Look, I'll get
this replaced. That's fine.

326
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:51,929
She's upset with her life.

327
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,764
Jesus!

328
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:54,682
Can I get my money back?

329
00:15:54,683 --> 00:15:56,367
Look, I'll get you more stuff,

330
00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:57,669
but I'm not giving
you your money back.

331
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,803
I don't want more stuff.

332
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:01,005
I'm sorry I dumped stuff on you,

333
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:02,272
but I'll just have
it replaced, okay?

334
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:03,741
Lady!

335
00:16:03,742 --> 00:16:05,509
It's okay.

336
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,944
Do you have a manager?

337
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,312
Hey, it's okay. It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

338
00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:10,481
Hold on. No, no, no.
Do you have a manager?

339
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:12,850
Don't worry about it. It's fine.
It will dry.

340
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:16,086
This is why I don't want to eat
in these fucking places, man.

341
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:17,355
Look at this shit.

342
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:18,489
Do you think she likes it?

343
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,325
Dude, do you think that I like

344
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:24,061
having whatever-the-fuck this
kind of salad is,

345
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:28,633
this salad dressing,
extra ranch?

346
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:30,868
Is this quality service?

347
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:32,136
Hello? Hello?

348
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:38,726
Yeah, don't forget
the tray, right?

349
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,798
That's great. It's all clean.

350
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,966
Thank you.

351
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,067
Like, take this guy.

352
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:49,420
You see him walking
down the street?

353
00:16:49,421 --> 00:16:51,105
Smile on his face.

354
00:16:51,106 --> 00:16:53,991
He's got nice clothes on.

355
00:16:53,992 --> 00:16:55,993
What's he doing? What do you
think he does?

356
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:59,563
I don't know. What's he do?

357
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:01,532
Maybe a banker.

358
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:03,101
He's delirious, though.

359
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:06,204
Maybe a travelling salesman?

360
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:08,806
He's delirious, why?

361
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:10,407
That guy helps to
wreck the economy.

362
00:17:10,408 --> 00:17:12,076
He helps to wreck the world.

363
00:17:12,077 --> 00:17:16,414
He eats in Styrofoam
fucking cups.

364
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:18,549
He's terrible, delirious.

365
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,951
That's not what the world needs.

366
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,803
What does the world need?

367
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:24,638
The world needs change, man.

368
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:26,607
What kind of change?

369
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:30,511
Who is going to do it?

370
00:17:30,512 --> 00:17:31,912
Dude, the problem is--

371
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:33,747
As one person,
what could you do?

372
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:35,516
--that this fucking world grows

373
00:17:35,517 --> 00:17:37,635
by like 70 million people a
year. That's the problem.

374
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:39,904
There's too many people.

375
00:17:39,905 --> 00:17:41,872
And so our natural resources
are running out.

376
00:17:41,873 --> 00:17:44,308
And no one, and no one--
look, we have trains.

377
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:47,311
We have-- we have cars,
tons of cars

378
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:50,280
that are just burning up gas and
making this place disgusting.

379
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:51,749
We've got a hole in the ozone.

380
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,818
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

381
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:56,788
You have chicken that looks
like-- yeah, of course, man.

382
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:58,589
It's just disgusting.
That's all.

383
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,624
It's just absolutely
fucking sick.

384
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,660
It makes me just sick.

385
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:05,229
But what are you supposed
to do, stop living?

386
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,448
There's two kinds of people--
leavers and takers.

387
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:11,468
And the leavers coexist.

388
00:18:11,469 --> 00:18:14,304
We need people that coexist.

389
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:17,608
And the takers is the
society of the world.

390
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:20,011
The takers is the
people that fucking--

391
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:24,949
that just, like, drive
Ferraris not caring.

392
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,467
Because people
have to make money.

393
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:28,369
No, people don't
have to make money.

394
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,871
People have to make money.

395
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:31,338
That's the thing. That's what
I'm talking about, man.

396
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:32,973
People don't have to.

397
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:34,642
That's the thing that society
drills in your head

398
00:18:34,643 --> 00:18:36,444
over and over and over since
you've been fucking 5-years-old

399
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:38,145
that you have to have
a big bank account.

400
00:18:38,146 --> 00:18:39,480
You have to make a lot of money.
You have to have a fast car.

401
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:42,349
It makes life a lot easier,
doesn't it?

402
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,684
Dude, but what happens--

403
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:45,920
Would you want to be poor?
Do you want to be poor?

404
00:18:45,921 --> 00:18:47,455
Do you want to have no money?

405
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:49,490
You keep going down this road.
Do you know where it's going?

406
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:51,258
So you just think just keep
going down the reckless path,

407
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:53,678
just fucking-- pile straight
ahead, because there's no--

408
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,845
We're all just fucked.

409
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:56,113
What's the point?

410
00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:57,347
That's the most pessimistic
point of view

411
00:18:57,348 --> 00:18:58,749
I've ever heard in my life.

412
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:02,436
You're a prodigy of the world,
my son, a prodigy of the world.

413
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:04,104
You're all talk, buddy.
You're all talk.

414
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:05,990
Oh, snap.

415
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:08,459
All talk?

416
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,993
All talk, no action.

417
00:19:38,774 --> 00:19:41,241
That's helping. I stood on my
feet all day today.

418
00:19:41,242 --> 00:19:44,845
Not to change the subject,
but when is dinner?

419
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:46,247
No-- hi.

420
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:48,883
Hey, hey, hey.

421
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:49,917
Yeah?

422
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:51,669
No phone call?

423
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,870
Sorry.

424
00:19:52,871 --> 00:19:53,888
Where have you been?

425
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:54,989
What are you guys doing?

426
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,056
What do you mean,
what have we been doing?

427
00:19:56,057 --> 00:19:57,458
We've been waiting for you?

428
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:59,676
Remember, we had this meeting
planned, right?

429
00:19:59,677 --> 00:20:00,677
I was going to pick up pizza--

430
00:20:00,678 --> 00:20:01,979
How long is
it going to take?

431
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,415
Oh, come on.

432
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,618
It's just going to
take as long as it takes.

433
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:11,488
No, no, no, no.
Can we do it tomorrow morning?

434
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:14,225
I've got some very exciting
news for you guys,

435
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:18,412
and I actually ate at the
Chicken Den--

436
00:20:18,413 --> 00:20:20,181
Oh, come on, Bill.

437
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:21,582
We organized this.

438
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:22,683
I know.

439
00:20:22,684 --> 00:20:24,252
We talked about it this
morning, remember?

440
00:20:24,253 --> 00:20:26,354
It was like nine hours ago.

441
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:27,688
Tomorrow--
Oh, jeez.

442
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:29,089
We'll talk about
it at breakfast,

443
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,826
and I've got very, very exciting
news for you guys, okay?

444
00:20:31,827 --> 00:20:34,128
Okay, are you going to
be on time for once?

445
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:35,195
Yes, on time.

446
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:36,330
That's exciting news.

447
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:37,398
Okay, well, I will make a
special breakfast.

448
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:41,802
No-- no coping out this time.

449
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,454
No, absolutely, I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

450
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:45,689
You promise?

451
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,458
Promise. Good night, guys.

452
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:50,962
Wow, I kind of figured
that would happen.

453
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:53,130
Yeah, that's typical.

454
00:20:53,131 --> 00:20:57,568
That's typical, every,
every time.

455
00:20:57,569 --> 00:20:59,420
Why is he resisting
this so much?

456
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:00,588
I don't know.

457
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:03,057
Do you think he's hiding
something? Is he okay?

458
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:05,092
I just think he's--

459
00:21:05,093 --> 00:21:07,428
{Newscasters overlapping}
...Psychiatrist Michelle His tow
has a theory about Kyle.

460
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:12,049
When I saw him, he had already
murdered seven people.

461
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,285
Our work is gripping and
unpredictable.

462
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:19,023
This is not the way
conventional psychiatry works.

463
00:21:19,024 --> 00:21:21,892
Up next, an interview with
Michelle His tow.

464
00:22:05,253 --> 00:22:07,888
We have the right to drive
whenever, wherever,

465
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:10,624
and whatever we want, but we
need to understand the effects

466
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,058
of the carbon footprint

467
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:13,527
and realize the
environmental damage

468
00:22:13,528 --> 00:22:15,312
cars are causing
to our planet.

469
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:17,732
Al Qaeda is all over Iraq.

470
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:19,199
The administration
of the U.S. president

471
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,135
will likely
double the bounty on...

472
00:22:21,136 --> 00:22:22,870
The BTK killer has confessed

473
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:24,638
to killing 10 people and
tonight...

474
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:26,773
The United States will deploy
30,000 additional troops...

475

EVAN:
The global population grows by
over 70 million people a year.

476
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:32,947
At the same time, our natural
resources are dwindling--

477
00:22:32,948 --> 00:22:35,049
coal oil, gas, water.

478
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,084
Okay, and with the development
of the third world

479
00:22:37,085 --> 00:22:38,686
we're just creating a ticking
time bomb,

480
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:42,289
and even though we know that
forests are essential

481
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,444
to reducing carbon emissions,
we continue to cut them down,

482
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:51,148
whether it's for housing,
farming, alternative energy,

483
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:52,849
or just useless furniture

484
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,919
instead of truly getting
together and fighting

485
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,140
for something, fighting
against global warming,

486
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:02,710
against political
and social unrest.

487
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:05,713
Our politicians are using the
same lame band-aid techniques

488
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:09,066
up for re-elections,
over and over.

489
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:11,302
What we need is change.

490
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:13,137
We can't stand
for this anymore.

491
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:15,655
Any why do we accept this?

492
00:23:15,656 --> 00:23:18,125
Because we're a society
built on wants.

493
00:23:18,126 --> 00:23:19,360
Not needs.

494
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:21,595
What are we taught
to want from childhood?

495
00:23:21,596 --> 00:23:24,064
Hmm? Big bank accounts.

496
00:23:24,065 --> 00:23:28,702
Fast cars, plasma screen TVs,
liposuction.

497
00:23:28,703 --> 00:23:30,070
Okay, facelifts.

498
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:31,872
Does this help anyone? No.

499
00:23:31,873 --> 00:23:34,674
What is this? This is ego.

500
00:23:34,675 --> 00:23:37,778
This doesn't help the world.

501
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:39,880
We need to bind together.

502
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:41,315
We don't need to be
individuals.

503
00:23:41,316 --> 00:23:46,270
We need to become whole as a
country, as world.

504
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:49,140
We need someone who
will stand for something.

505
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:52,376
We need someone who
believes in what they say

506
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:54,862
and believes in actions
changing the way

507
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:56,497
that we view our world.

508
00:24:30,882 --> 00:24:34,901
We can't survive with our
politicians focusing their time

509
00:24:34,902 --> 00:24:36,870
on fighting religious wars,

510
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:40,507
fighting over control
of natural resources.

511
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:43,677
Can anyone do this?

512
00:24:43,678 --> 00:24:46,180
Well, I don't know.

513
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:48,048
Do you have any thoughts?

514
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:54,121
We're so precious, aren't we?

515
00:24:54,122 --> 00:24:56,056
Everyone has got to live.

516
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:58,492
Everyone has got to be happy.

517
00:24:58,493 --> 00:25:01,361
It's a joke.

518
00:25:01,362 --> 00:25:03,097
It's an absolute joke.

519
00:25:03,098 --> 00:25:05,115
Humanity can't survive
over the next 100 years.

520
00:25:05,116 --> 00:25:06,616
The facts don't lie.

521
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:09,219
We need someone who will
stand for something.

522
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,506
We need someone who
believes in what they say

523
00:25:12,507 --> 00:25:15,409
and believes in action,
believes in positive action.

524
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:20,214
It's an absolute joke.

525
00:25:20,215 --> 00:25:23,217
Evan, that's what
you didn't get.

526
00:25:23,218 --> 00:25:24,751
That's what you didn't get.

527
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:27,187
You think people are equal.
They're not.

528
00:25:27,188 --> 00:25:30,273
They're not.

529
00:25:30,274 --> 00:25:41,851
¶

530
00:25:54,883 --> 00:25:57,150
{Newscasters overlapping}
...just like President Richard
Nixon did to the Vietnamese

531
00:25:57,151 --> 00:25:58,752
back in the late '60s--

532
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:01,105
Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda,

533
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:03,307
these people are out
to kill us. People don't--

534
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:05,075
All of these things
contribute

535
00:26:05,076 --> 00:26:07,444
to the problem of
overpopulation.

536
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:09,046
People don't comprehend
the danger

537
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:11,615
that this country
creates for the world.

538
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:14,451
If just 15 millilitres is
released and becomes airborne,

539
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:16,453
this chemical could kill a
million people.

540
00:26:16,454 --> 00:26:19,390
--About society and people
in the humanitarian sense.

541
00:26:19,391 --> 00:26:20,624
We need to changes
to protect the--

542
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:28,265
Thessalonians 3:10 says,

543
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:31,585
"For even when we are with you,
this we commanded you,

544
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:35,322
that if any would not work,
neither should he eat."

545
00:26:35,323 --> 00:26:38,108
The global population grows by
over 70 million people a year.

546
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:49,803
And why do we accept this?

547
00:26:49,804 --> 00:26:52,539
Because we're a society
built on wants.

548
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,974
Not needs. What are we taught
to want from childhood?

549
00:26:54,975 --> 00:26:56,576
Hmm?

550
00:26:56,577 --> 00:26:58,678
Big bank accounts.

551
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,831
Fast cars, plasma screen TVs,
liposuction.

552
00:27:01,832 --> 00:27:03,300
Okay, facelifts.

553
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:04,901
Does this help anyone? No.

554
00:27:04,902 --> 00:27:06,920
What is this? This is ego.

555
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:09,223
We need someone who
will stand for something.

556
00:27:09,224 --> 00:27:12,459
We need someone who
believes in what they say

557
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,663
and believes in action,
believes in positive action

558
00:27:16,664 --> 00:27:18,482
and changing the way
that we look at things,

559
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:21,652
changing the way that
we view our world.

560
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:23,320
BILL:
So that's what I'll do.

561
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:24,454
My name is Evan Drince.

562
00:27:24,455 --> 00:27:26,456
Why not?

563
00:27:30,594 --> 00:27:32,428
Bill?

564
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:33,813
Breakfast is ready, Bill.

565
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:37,718
What?

566
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:39,486
I said breakfast!

567
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:41,722
I'll be up in 15 minutes!
I'm working out!

568
00:27:53,852 --> 00:27:55,285
Good morning, honey.

569
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:57,354
Morning.
That smells really good.

570
00:27:57,355 --> 00:27:59,155
I'm glad we're actually having a
nice breakfast together,

571
00:27:59,156 --> 00:28:02,009
because yesterday
was a bit tense.

572
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,878
Well, you guys dropped a--
dropped a bomb on me.

573
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:07,213
I know, but I feel like--

574
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:09,850
I think we've reached some
kind of agreement, right?

575
00:28:09,851 --> 00:28:12,602
And today, what I'm
going to do for you guys

576
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:15,856
is that I'm going
to be proactive.

577
00:28:15,857 --> 00:28:18,575
And today, I'm going to stay in.
I've got the day off.

578
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:20,661
I'm going to fill out some
college applications,

579
00:28:20,662 --> 00:28:21,828
and I'm thinking--

580
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:24,565
What did my ears just hear?

581
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:28,669
That I'm going to fill out some
college applications,

582
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,704
mechanical engineer.

583
00:28:30,705 --> 00:28:31,705
Honey!

584
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:33,040
Who kidnapped our son?

585
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,808
What's going on?
That's fantastic!

586
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,376
Yeah, it makes sense, right?

587
00:28:36,377 --> 00:28:37,544
Okay, you know, I--

588
00:28:37,545 --> 00:28:39,112
That's fantastic. Good job.

589
00:28:39,113 --> 00:28:40,714
So are you guys happy?

590
00:28:40,715 --> 00:28:43,449
I've got to say
I'm really proud of you.

591
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,885
Uh-huh.

592
00:28:44,886 --> 00:28:46,619
Well, I think it's
about time, right?

593
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,123
I think our little talk maybe
got in there somewhere, huh?

594
00:28:50,124 --> 00:28:54,478
You guys kicked my little
tushie out the door.

595
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:55,779
With love.

596
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,481
Absolutely.

597
00:28:57,482 --> 00:28:58,431
You know what?
Here's the thing.

598
00:28:58,432 --> 00:28:59,967
You're going to feel better
about yourself

599
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:01,768
once you have, like, goals.

600
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:04,004
I know. I do have goals, Mom.

601
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:05,805
Look, I've got to go.

602
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:07,808
We'll talk about
it more later.

603
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:08,809
Okay, chin up.

604
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,376
Okay. Bye, Dad.

605
00:29:10,377 --> 00:29:11,728
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

606
00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:14,298
Okay, we'll talk at dinner.

607
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:15,365
I'm really, really
proud of you.

608
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:16,866
I think what you're
going to feel

609
00:29:16,867 --> 00:29:21,305
is that you have goals in life
now and a direction.

610
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:22,306
Right.

611
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:23,573
Yeah.

612
00:29:23,574 --> 00:29:27,210
Yeah, I woke up today
feeling enthusiastic.

613
00:29:27,211 --> 00:29:30,713
My little boy,
he's growing up.

614
00:29:30,714 --> 00:29:32,632
Come here.

615
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:37,170
It's out of love that we kick
your bum-- your bum.

616
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:38,605
Sorry about the language.

617
00:29:38,606 --> 00:29:40,190
Have a good day at work, okay?

618
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:42,909
I will, sweetheart.
I'm very excited for you,

619
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,911
and I want to see how this turns
out with the applications.

620
00:29:44,912 --> 00:29:46,079
Okay.
Okay.

621
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,080
I'll see you tonight.

622
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:48,082
Bye, honey.

623
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:51,085
All right.

624
00:29:51,086 --> 00:29:54,487
BILL:
Evan, you think
people are equal.

625
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:58,007
They're not. They're not.

626
00:29:58,008 --> 00:30:00,377
Evan, Evan, Evan, Evan.

627
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:03,746
You're such an idiot.

628
00:30:03,747 --> 00:30:06,850
They're like a drop in a bucket.

629
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:10,704
I just poured the bucket out.

630
00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:14,141
Yeah, you couldn't do anything.

631
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:17,511
All you could do is talk--
meaningless.

632
00:30:17,512 --> 00:30:20,380
Do anything.

633
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:24,284
Well, I guess I did.

634
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:26,619
{Newscasters overlapping}
...shot about five or six
times and everybody...

635
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,455
...most of the shooting right
here at this location

636
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:30,674
where most of the
bullet casings are...

637
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:32,909
BILL:
In nature, there's
survival of the fittest.

638
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,829
What separates us
from the animals?

639
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,781
It's our consciousness.

640
00:30:38,782 --> 00:30:40,516
It's our ego.

641
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:42,652
It's our sense of self...

642
00:30:42,653 --> 00:30:46,622
So, all of a sudden, we care
about ourselves too much.

643
00:30:46,623 --> 00:30:49,893
We care about our
fellow man too much.

644
00:30:53,564 --> 00:30:55,232
We have to do anything that
we can to keep them alive.

645
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:58,168
You know, the animals
just want to eat.

646
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:01,754
They just want to eat.

647
00:31:01,755 --> 00:31:04,757
They'll kill you
so they can eat.

648
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:14,267
EVAN:
Can anyone do this?

649
00:31:14,268 --> 00:31:16,269
I don't know.

650
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,571
Do you have any thoughts?

651
00:31:28,065 --> 00:31:29,999
BILL:
Let's face it.

652
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,804
If we could just kill everybody,

653
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:38,842
you know, in the third world,

654
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:41,811
people with cancer, you know,

655
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:44,715
people that are sucking up
our resources,

656
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,650
maybe we could survive.

657
00:31:46,651 --> 00:31:48,017
{Voices overlapping}
The Bible says
we must not kill.

658
00:31:48,018 --> 00:31:50,120
The bible says we must not
commit adultery.

659
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:51,588
...Most of the shooting right
here at this location

660
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:52,756
where most of the bullet
casings are,

661
00:31:52,757 --> 00:31:54,090
and then ran off
in that direction

662
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:55,525
while still shooting...

663
00:31:55,526 --> 00:31:59,263
Survival of the fittest is
really, is a real theory.

664
00:31:59,264 --> 00:32:03,199
That's a way to create balance.

665
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,700
I don't believe in god.

666
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:08,538
I believe in what I see,
the pain and suffering I see.

667
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:10,106
I believe that when I go out in
the street

668
00:32:10,107 --> 00:32:11,674
and I see a mother who can't
feed her child...

669
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:14,777
Described as a loner who never
fit in with his classmates...

670
00:32:14,778 --> 00:32:16,746
Couldn't do anything.

671
00:32:16,747 --> 00:32:19,416
All you could do was talk...
Meaningless.

672
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:29,492

What kind of change?
Who's going to do it? You?

I don't know.

00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:49,305
Do you have any thoughts?

681
00:34:09,293 --> 00:34:12,346
All talk, no action.

682
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:24,608

Open the back.

Oh, hi.

You're scared as shit, huh?

705
00:38:58,315 --> 00:38:59,649
Here we go.

Hey, man, how are you?

710
00:40:54,347 --> 00:40:56,933
Oh, hey, man,
you remember me?

711
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:58,418
Uh...

712
00:41:01,088 --> 00:41:06,042
Why don't you make me
a double espresso macchiato

713
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:07,777
with extra foam?

714

You got it.

715
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:10,313
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

716
00:41:10,314 --> 00:41:12,465
Why don't you make it like
your life depends on it?

With extra foam!

718

You like to take your sweet
fucking time, don't you?

There you go.

720
00:41:42,363 --> 00:41:45,265
Why is this so difficult?

721
00:41:45,266 --> 00:41:50,019
I mean, how hard can it be?

722
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,937
I'm going to give you
five seconds

723
00:41:50,938 --> 00:41:52,272
to get the fuck out of here.

724

Are you serious?

Yeah, yeah!
I'm pretty fucking serious!

Again, we are strongly advising
people to stay inside,

734

as early reports indicate that
chaos in downtown Centerville

is caused by a
heavily-armed individual

No, calm down. No, no.

You get over there.
You get over there.

Hey, ladies. Out of the kitchen.

Go join your pretty friends.

No one?

It's just us here.

754
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,861
What about this door?

755

Come on, ladies.

Right.

And we are still getting
reports that a brown van

was seen smashing into the
front of the police station

838
00:50:37,046 --> 00:50:38,781
just moments before
the massive explosion

839
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:42,001
that woke Centerville
residents up this morning.

Everybody get

Ladies, back the fuck up!

Nobody presses the alarm!
Let's go!

Ladies, back the fuck up!

845

Don't touch those alarms!

846

You too.

847
00:51:09,462 --> 00:51:11,864
Let's go, big shot.

Don't be scared, big shot.

Ahh!

What the fuck was that?!

Anybody else want
to play hero, huh?

855

What are you doing in here?

Give me your fucking phone!

Everyone is out there.
What are you doing in here?

Money.

00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:29,892
Come on,
quick.
Money, money.

867
00:52:29,893 --> 00:52:31,994
Money? Oh, you're
a smart one, genius.

868
00:52:31,995 --> 00:52:32,995
Get in the back!

869
00:52:32,996 --> 00:52:34,029
It's in the safe.

870
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,330
Where? In the safe? Go!

871
00:52:35,331 --> 00:52:36,699
I don't have the key.
I don't have the key.

872
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,000
You don't have the fucking key?
Where is the fucking key?

873
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:39,001
In my office.

874
00:52:39,002 --> 00:52:40,686
Go get it.

875
00:52:40,687 --> 00:52:42,654
Don't fuck around!

876
00:52:42,655 --> 00:52:46,658
You, you work here or do you
just dress like an idiot?

877
00:52:46,659 --> 00:52:48,961
Empty the registers, fuck face.

878
00:52:48,962 --> 00:52:50,762
Empty the registers.

879

Open the safe. Open the safe.

885
00:53:07,363 --> 00:53:09,748
Hurry up. What are you,
retarded?

886
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:19,892
Give me-- give me the bag.
Give me the bag.

887
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,330
Keep it.

888
00:53:28,651 --> 00:53:31,353
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

889
00:53:31,354 --> 00:53:34,289
Bro, calm down.

890
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,375
Calm down, all right?

891
00:53:36,376 --> 00:53:38,310
Everything is going to be okay.

892
00:53:38,311 --> 00:53:39,294
I'm not going to kill you.

893
00:53:39,295 --> 00:53:43,215
I don't know why I'm not.

894
00:53:43,216 --> 00:53:46,051
Is this your first time?

895
00:53:46,052 --> 00:53:49,555
Is this your
first time?

896
00:53:49,556 --> 00:53:51,990
What the fuck is wrong
with you, huh?

897
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:53,976
What the fuck is wrong
with you, huh?

898
00:53:53,977 --> 00:53:55,978
Punch in the code!

899

I got it! I got it!

900

There you go.
There it is.

You see? You see?

904
00:54:11,861 --> 00:54:13,695
It's money.

905
00:54:13,696 --> 00:54:16,732
It's about as
worthless as you are.

906
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:17,766
Hurry up.

907
00:54:17,767 --> 00:54:18,967
I'm hurrying.

908
00:54:18,968 --> 00:54:19,768
Hurry up.

909
00:54:19,769 --> 00:54:21,987
Please, just don't shoot.

910
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:25,440
That's it. That's all of it.

911
00:54:25,441 --> 00:54:28,060
Give me the fucking bag.
Stay there.

912
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:29,461
Thank you.
Pinhead.

913
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:56,738
Your fucking money
doesn't mean anything,

914
00:54:56,739 --> 00:54:59,007
because all you use it for

915
00:54:59,008 --> 00:55:02,544
is stupid and senseless shit!

916
00:55:02,545 --> 00:55:05,381
What is he doing out there?

917
00:55:16,893 --> 00:55:18,226
Say goodbye!

918
00:55:23,967 --> 00:55:25,433
Lock the door!

919
00:55:25,434 --> 00:55:28,370

00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,581

Yes, yes! Killing people!

he killed people?

No, not just yet, sweetheart.

I mean, I'll be here.

970
00:58:39,979 --> 00:58:42,147
Yes, stay there, okay?

971
00:58:42,148 --> 00:58:44,216
Sweetie, I love you.
Please be safe, okay?

972
00:58:44,217 --> 00:58:45,617
Okay, stay safe.

973
00:58:45,618 --> 00:58:47,885
All right, baby. I love you.
Bye-bye.

974
00:59:06,622 --> 00:59:09,091
{Horn honking}

975
00:59:28,911 --> 00:59:31,362
Fuck!

976
00:59:31,363 --> 00:59:32,881
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, man!

977
00:59:32,882 --> 00:59:34,849
{Phone ringing}

978
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:35,634
Evan.

979
00:59:35,635 --> 00:59:36,718
Billy.

980
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:37,636
Hey.

981
00:59:37,637 --> 00:59:38,720
Yeah, where are you?

982
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:39,721
I'm running some
errands right now, man.

983
00:59:39,722 --> 00:59:41,123
What errands?

984
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:42,808
I'm coming right now, Bro.
Don't go anywhere, okay?

985
00:59:42,809 --> 00:59:44,342
Yeah, I'm not going.

986
00:59:44,343 --> 00:59:46,244
Don't go anywhere. I'm getting
in my car right now. Okay, bye.

987
01:00:06,149 --> 01:00:08,549
Oh, I'm going fucking nuts.

988
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:14,205
Yeah, who's the winner, Bill?

989
01:00:14,206 --> 01:00:16,207
Who is the winner?
No, I'm not going to shoot you.

990
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:18,176
Oh, I'm just fucking kidding.

991
01:00:18,177 --> 01:00:21,380
Seriously, though, seriously.

992
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:23,382
Have you ever seen
a fucking cowboy?

993
01:01:31,951 --> 01:01:33,835
Fuck this kid.

994
01:01:33,836 --> 01:01:35,270
Fucking...

995
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:38,906
{Dialling}

996
01:01:42,945 --> 01:01:45,947
{Phone ringing}

997
01:01:49,252 --> 01:01:50,252
Hello!

998
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:52,987
Evan.

999
01:01:52,988 --> 01:01:54,989
I'm leaving.
I'm fucking leaving!

1000
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,624
No, you're not, man.

1001
01:01:56,625 --> 01:01:57,792
Dude, you're taking
for fucking ever!

1002
01:01:57,793 --> 01:01:59,660
I've had a lot of shit
to do today, okay?

1003
01:01:59,661 --> 01:02:02,731
It's been a fucked up afternoon.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

1004
01:02:02,732 --> 01:02:03,732
Don't go anywhere.

1005
01:02:03,733 --> 01:02:05,700
I've been wait--
Dude, I've been waiting.

1006
01:02:05,701 --> 01:02:07,235
Ten minutes, my fucking ass.

1007
01:02:07,236 --> 01:02:09,304
I've been waiting here for
fucking 45 minutes.

1008
01:02:09,305 --> 01:02:11,673
Paintball. Paintball.
Paintball, bro.

1009
01:02:11,674 --> 01:02:12,590
So?

1010
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:15,509
We're going to play paintball.

1011
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:16,695
Give me a fucking good reason--

1012
01:02:16,696 --> 01:02:19,664
and I want a fucking articulate
reason-- why I should stay.

1013
01:02:19,665 --> 01:02:20,499
Why should I stay?

1014
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:23,818
I'm going to fucking
kill you, man.

1015
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:25,019
Listen, you're the one--
You're going to be needing

1016
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,354
some fucking target practice,
all right?

1017
01:02:26,355 --> 01:02:29,924
You're not going to
go anywhere, right?

1018
01:02:29,925 --> 01:02:31,792
Just stay there for ten
minutes, okay?

1019
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:34,195
I'm coming. I promise.
I love you, man.

1020
01:02:34,196 --> 01:02:35,530
All right. I'll see you soon.

1021
01:02:35,531 --> 01:02:36,681
Okay.

1022
01:02:54,417 --> 01:02:57,619
We can go a little faster, Ray.

1023
01:03:02,942 --> 01:03:05,410
{Explosion}

1024
01:03:34,207 --> 01:03:37,809
{Siren wailing}

1025
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,231
Closer, Ray.

1026
01:03:59,348 --> 01:04:12,493
¶

1027
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:25,390
Shit.

1028
01:04:25,391 --> 01:04:26,791
Bump him.

1029
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:51,025
{Explosion}

1030
01:06:03,555 --> 01:06:06,324
{Laughing}

1031
01:06:26,078 --> 01:06:27,645
This is Sheriff Malvoy.

1032
01:06:27,646 --> 01:06:29,214
I'm at the roundabout
in the County Park.

1033
01:06:29,215 --> 01:06:30,815
I've got two more
deputies down.

1034
01:06:30,816 --> 01:06:32,984
I'm pursuing the
suspect on foot.

1035
01:07:29,859 --> 01:07:31,977
{Groaning}

1036
01:07:31,978 --> 01:07:33,979
{Gunshot}

1037
01:07:41,653 --> 01:07:43,621
You got blood on me.

1038
01:07:55,734 --> 01:07:57,735
60 to 80 seconds.

1039
01:08:55,461 --> 01:08:56,461
You ready?

1040
01:08:56,462 --> 01:08:58,129
What the fuck?

1041
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:59,830
Is that what you took two
fucking hours doing?

1042
01:08:59,831 --> 01:09:02,400
I'm glad you
didn't leave, buddy.

1043
01:09:02,401 --> 01:09:04,402
I brought you a gift.

1044
01:09:08,907 --> 01:09:10,375
What the fuck?

1045
01:09:10,376 --> 01:09:11,376
Check it out.

1046
01:09:11,377 --> 01:09:13,478
Dude!

1047
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:15,213
Dude, this is real money.

1048
01:09:15,214 --> 01:09:18,015
It's a shit-load of money.

1049
01:09:18,016 --> 01:09:21,619
Where the fuck did you get all
of this fucking money?

1050
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:22,887
Hey, Evan?

1051
01:09:22,888 --> 01:09:24,456
Yeah?

1052
01:09:24,457 --> 01:09:25,623
Check it out.

1053
01:09:25,624 --> 01:09:27,992
{Electrical buzzing}

1054
01:09:27,993 --> 01:09:29,026
{Moaning}

1055
01:09:29,027 --> 01:09:31,929
You all right?

1056
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:34,365
Give me your hand.

1057
01:09:34,366 --> 01:09:38,269
Hold this. Hold this.

1058
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:41,372
You kind of asked
for it, right?

1059
01:09:41,373 --> 01:09:43,774
I kind of made you the martyr
you always wanted to be.

1060
01:09:45,978 --> 01:09:47,812
{Gunshot}

1061
01:12:05,033 --> 01:12:07,801
EVAN:
You are a prodigy of the world,
my son, a prodigy of the world.

1062
01:12:07,802 --> 01:12:10,154
DAD:
We'd like you to...

1063
01:12:10,155 --> 01:12:12,940
EVAN:
Stop having these things
sent to my fucking house.

1064
01:12:12,941 --> 01:12:14,775
BILL:
Last ones, man.

1065
01:12:14,776 --> 01:12:16,410
You're making me pay
for my own post education.

1066
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:18,529
EVAN:
I've been waiting
for fucking 45 minutes.

1067
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:21,281
BILL:
I made you the martyr
you always wanted to be.

1068
01:12:21,282 --> 01:12:24,335
MOM:
Okay, sweetie.
I love you. Be safe.

1069
01:12:24,336 --> 01:12:28,739
WOMAN:
You're going to pay for this!
Do you hear me?

1070
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:31,342
BILL:
What do you think I want?
Come on, quick.

1071
01:12:31,343 --> 01:12:33,945
MANAGER:
Money! Money! Money!

1072
01:12:33,946 --> 01:12:36,464
EVAN:
I don't know.
My name is Evan Drince.

1073
01:12:36,465 --> 01:12:38,382
Do you have any thoughts?

1074
01:12:38,383 --> 01:12:40,384
BILL:
Your fucking money
doesn't mean anything!

1075
01:13:15,454 --> 01:13:18,489
TV:
...dozens of Centerville
residents and police officers

1076
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:21,525
earlier today, during what can
only be described

1077
01:13:21,526 --> 01:13:23,878
as a massacre.

1078
01:13:23,879 --> 01:13:26,447
The rampage began with
a massive explosion

1079
01:13:26,448 --> 01:13:27,732
that destroyed Centerville
police station.

1080
01:13:27,733 --> 01:13:31,101
MOM:
Oh, God, honey.
There you are, sweetheart.

1081
01:13:31,102 --> 01:13:32,352
This is just so awful.

1082
01:13:32,353 --> 01:13:35,589
I'm so glad you're here.

1083
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:37,959
You're okay, though, yeah?

1084
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:41,628
I'm so glad you
weren't out in this. This was--

1085
01:13:41,629 --> 01:13:42,964
Are you okay, Bill?

1086
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:44,198
You were back here
when this started?

1087
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:46,267
I drove by the bakery,

1088
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:47,969
and the whole glass was
shattered out of the bakery.

1089
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:49,136
This is the forest.

1090
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:52,506
Look, this is where
they found the guy.

1091
01:13:52,507 --> 01:13:53,507
They found the shooter already?

1092
01:13:53,508 --> 01:13:54,541
Yeah.

1093
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:55,542
Wait a second.
One guy did all of this?

1094
01:13:55,543 --> 01:13:57,111
It was Evan.

1095
01:13:57,112 --> 01:14:00,047
Evan got shot?
Did Evan get shot?

1096
01:14:00,048 --> 01:14:03,634
No, Mom. Evan did it.
My friend, Evan.

1097
01:14:03,635 --> 01:14:05,069
Oh, my God.

1098
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:06,904
Shot all of the--?

1099
01:14:06,905 --> 01:14:09,540
Have they announced his name or
you just recognized him?

1100
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:11,608
They just said it,
Evan Drince, Evan Drince.

1101
01:14:11,609 --> 01:14:14,178
Breaking news.
Unbelievable.

1102
01:14:14,179 --> 01:14:16,980
How did they find him? Like,
what? Did he give himself up?

1103
01:14:16,981 --> 01:14:18,482
They just found
him in the woods.

1104
01:14:18,483 --> 01:14:20,017
He shot himself in the head.

1105
01:14:20,018 --> 01:14:21,218
He's dead?

1106
01:14:21,219 --> 01:14:23,987
He committed suicide.
He committed suicide.

1107
01:14:23,988 --> 01:14:25,656
This is insane.

1108
01:14:25,657 --> 01:14:27,058
This world is a crazy place,
isn't it?

1109
01:14:27,059 --> 01:14:28,759
He was a fucked up kid.

1110
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,611
Oh...

1111
01:14:30,612 --> 01:14:32,480
I thought he was--
I thought he was a bit odd,

1112
01:14:32,481 --> 01:14:34,147
but I didn't think
he was a--

1113
01:14:34,148 --> 01:14:36,066
Psychopath?

1114
01:14:36,067 --> 01:14:38,135
He looked like he had secrets.

1115
01:14:38,136 --> 01:14:40,137
I mean, I'm just
an armchair psychologist,

1116
01:14:40,138 --> 01:14:42,507
but a mother knows.

1117
01:14:42,508 --> 01:14:44,642
Like, you just intuit.

1118
01:14:44,643 --> 01:14:46,010
Yeah.

1119
01:14:46,011 --> 01:14:48,963
Nevertheless, it must be a shock
for his parents.

1120
01:14:48,964 --> 01:14:50,564
Have you spoken to them?

1121
01:14:50,565 --> 01:14:52,132
Uh, yeah.

1122
01:14:52,133 --> 01:14:53,367
I don't even want to ask you

1123
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:54,835
about the college
applications now.

1124
01:14:54,836 --> 01:14:59,523
It all seems
so trite, I guess.

1125
01:14:59,524 --> 01:15:01,191
I'm glad you guys
are okay, right?

1126
01:15:01,192 --> 01:15:02,192
Oh, yeah.

1127
01:15:02,193 --> 01:15:05,329
Oh, we're fine.

1128
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:06,880
Presently, the only
thing we know...

1129
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:08,782
This is where I drove by.

1130
01:15:08,783 --> 01:15:10,051
I told you I saw
that poor woman.

1131
01:15:10,052 --> 01:15:12,753
Do you think
it's Mrs. Blakeslee?

1132
01:15:12,754 --> 01:15:15,589
I didn't want to stay around
long enough to find out?

1133
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:17,391
Guys, I'm so tired.
I'm going to go to sleep.

1134
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:19,861
Oh, of course, honey.

1135
01:15:19,862 --> 01:15:21,262
I'm really sorry
about your friend.

1136
01:15:21,263 --> 01:15:22,730
I'm really sorry.

1137
01:15:27,502 --> 01:15:29,170
You give us a shout if
you need anything, okay?

1138
01:15:29,171 --> 01:15:30,971
All right.
Take care, guys.

1139
01:15:30,972 --> 01:15:32,406
Get some sleep.

1140
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:34,008
Yeah, sweetheart. Bye-bye.

1141
01:15:34,009 --> 01:15:36,410
I think he's
holding it in.

1142
01:15:36,411 --> 01:15:38,512
Maybe we should take
him to see somebody.

1143
01:15:38,513 --> 01:15:40,181
Well, for sure after this.

1144
01:15:40,182 --> 01:15:41,682
He's going to have
to go talk to someone.

1145
01:15:41,683 --> 01:15:43,718
Yeah.

1146
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:46,520
Just, I don't want anyone to
know that we're taking him.

1147
01:15:46,521 --> 01:15:47,988
Yeah, fair enough.

1148
01:15:47,989 --> 01:15:49,790
I don't want people to know and
think he's crazy or something.

1149
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:52,459
Oh, my God.
This is awful.

1150
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:54,228
Let's have a drink
or something, huh?

1151
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:57,198
Yeah, make me a
double, something.

1152
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:00,417
TV:
Stay tuned to this station for
an update of this tragic story

1153
01:16:00,418 --> 01:16:02,553
as more details
become available.

1154
01:16:24,409 --> 01:16:26,977
Centerville resident
Lloyd Drince,

1155
01:16:26,978 --> 01:16:30,498
the father of Evan Drince
was arrested at his home

1156
01:16:30,499 --> 01:16:32,350
when local authorities

1157
01:16:32,351 --> 01:16:34,618
attempted to enter the
premises.

1158
01:16:34,619 --> 01:16:37,955
Close sources reveal that Lloyd
Drince used to be a radical

1159
01:16:37,956 --> 01:16:42,926
and extreme protester
in the '60s and '70s,

1160
01:16:42,927 --> 01:16:45,629
especially at the height
of the war in Vietnam

1161
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:48,265
and has always been
strongly outspoken

1162
01:16:48,266 --> 01:16:50,334
against the government.

1163
01:16:50,335 --> 01:16:53,571
With the current evidence that
his son, Evan Drince,

1164
01:16:53,572 --> 01:16:56,507
has been identified as being
behind the massacre

1165
01:16:56,508 --> 01:16:58,876
in downtown Centerville today,

1166
01:16:58,877 --> 01:17:01,211
it appears that
radical measures

1167
01:17:01,212 --> 01:17:04,915
to get your opinions
out runs in the family.

1168
01:17:04,916 --> 01:17:07,651
To recap, the offender
has been identified

1169
01:17:07,652 --> 01:17:12,189
as 21-year-old Centerville
resident Evan Drince,

1170
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:15,726
who took his own life
in a nearby forested area

1171
01:17:15,727 --> 01:17:18,729
after completing his
destruction and killing spree.

1172
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:20,264
LLOYD DRINCE:
You've got the wrong kid!
My kid wouldn't do this!

1173
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:22,032
My kid's innocent!

1174
01:17:22,033 --> 01:17:23,734
Bill Williamson!

1175
01:17:23,735 --> 01:17:27,671
Bill Williamson did this!

1176
01:17:27,672 --> 01:17:30,040
Check Bill Williamson's house!

1177
01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:34,144
My kid is not a murderer!

1178
01:17:34,145 --> 01:17:37,581
My son is innocent!
Bill Williamson!

1179
01:17:37,582 --> 01:17:40,034
NEWSCASTER:
The authorities have not
pressed any charges

1180
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:43,737
or revealed information
about suspects

1181
01:17:43,738 --> 01:17:46,407
since they feel a thorough
investigation is needed...

1182
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:59,703
BILL:
It's a...

1183
01:17:59,704 --> 01:18:02,239
It's a downward spiral

1184
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:06,176
to the end of all times.

1185
01:18:06,177 --> 01:18:10,413
And there's no chance
that we can survive.

1186
01:18:10,414 --> 01:18:11,682
I mean...

1187
01:18:11,683 --> 01:18:14,484
70 million
people every year

1188
01:18:14,485 --> 01:18:16,654
are brought onto this Earth.

1189
01:18:16,655 --> 01:18:17,788
What are they doing?

1190
01:18:17,789 --> 01:18:19,556
Sucking up our resources.

1191
01:18:19,557 --> 01:18:22,860
There's too many people,
so what do we do?

1192
01:18:22,861 --> 01:18:24,895
Just keep them around?

1193
01:18:24,896 --> 01:18:26,497
Let's kill them.

1194
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:28,766
Let's get rid of them.

1195
01:18:28,767 --> 01:18:30,234
Good, thank you.

1196
01:18:30,235 --> 01:18:32,503
Thanks for--
thanks for coming out.

1197
01:18:32,504 --> 01:18:34,005
But you know what?

1198
01:18:34,006 --> 01:18:36,073
We're at capacity.

1199
01:18:36,074 --> 01:18:37,207
We're at capacity now.

1200
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:40,611
So... sorry, no more.

1201
01:18:40,612 --> 01:18:42,146
No more.

1202
01:18:42,147 --> 01:18:44,498
So that's what I'll do.

1203
01:18:44,499 --> 01:18:46,467
Why not?

1204
01:18:46,468 --> 01:18:48,069
That's my plan.

1205
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:49,603
That's what I want to do.

1206
01:18:49,604 --> 01:18:52,606
Let's just clean the world,

1207
01:18:52,607 --> 01:18:56,077
so maybe the rest of us can
sustain a little bit of life.

1208
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:02,500
So maybe that's what
I'll do in the future.

1209
01:19:02,501 --> 01:19:05,302
I'll help you out.

1210
01:19:05,303 --> 01:19:06,904
I'll help you out,

1211
01:19:06,905 --> 01:19:10,674
and I will cleanse,

1212
01:19:10,675 --> 01:19:13,744
make more room for you.

1213
01:19:13,745 --> 01:19:18,615
I will exhibit my own brand of
population control...

1214
01:19:18,616 --> 01:19:20,617
for you.

1215
01:19:23,554 --> 01:19:25,555
That's it.
