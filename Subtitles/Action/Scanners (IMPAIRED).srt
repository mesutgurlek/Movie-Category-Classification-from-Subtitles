1
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,788
Look at that fellow over there.

2
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:39,026
I have never seen anything
so disgusting in all my life.

3
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:43,549
I'll tell you something, he's staring.
I think he's looking at us.

4
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:46,669
I think we're being picked up.
- Oh, it's too awful.

5
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:50,790
Can you believe
they allow creatures like that in here?

6
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,890
Really.

7
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
(White noise humming)

8
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,160
Uh...

9
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,867
Uh-uh-uh...

10
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:07,997
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh...

11
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,490
Oh, help, someone, please.

12
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,620
(White noise intensifies)...

13
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,285
...(White noise fades)...

14
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,640
...(Man) She's going to be all right.
It's all right. Stand back.

15
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Ugh.

16
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,590
Damn it.

17
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,959
You're 35 years old, Mr. Vale.

18
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,747
Why are you such a derelict,

19
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:39,142
such a piece of human junk?

20
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,948
The answer is simple.

21
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:47,703
You are a scanner, which you don't realize.

22
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,255
That has been the source of all your agony.

23
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,390
But I will show you now
that it can be a source of great power.

24
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Let them in.

25
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,395
(People's thoughts echoing)

26
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Hurry up.

27
00:06:34,888 --> 00:06:36,916
(Muttering intensifies)

28
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Hurry up.

29
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,035
(Distorted, haunting voices)...

30
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,715
...(Distorted voices fading)...

31
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,188
...(Distorted voices end)

32
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:45,288
You can talk now.

33
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,865
I would like to scan all of you
in this room, one at a time.

34
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:03,628
I must remind you that the scanning
experience is usually a painful one,

35
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:08,548
sometimes resulting in nosebleeds,
earaches, stomach cramps, nausea,

36
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:11,786
sometimes other symptoms
of a similar nature.

37
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:14,707
There's a doctor present. Dr. Gatineau.

38
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:20,107
I know that you've all been prepared for this
but I thought I'd remind you just the same.

39
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:23,788
There is one other thing.
No one is to leave this room,

40
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:26,430
once the demonstration has begun.

41
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,440
At this point I'd like to call for volunteers.

42
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,629
(Audience muttering)

43
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:36,939
Anyone. It doesn't matter.

44
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Fine.

45
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,832
Just sit right here, please.

46
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,709
Now, I'd like you to think
of something specific,

47
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:11,345
that will not breach
the security of your organization,

48
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:13,708
and that can be disclosed to this group.

49
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:17,208
Something personal, perhaps.
- All right.

50
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,067
I have something. Shall I close my eyes?
- It doesn't matter.

51
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:24,972
All right, yes, I have something.

52
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,389
(Screaming)

53
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,050
Get everybody out, now.
Call ConSec leader.

54
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,750
I want you to come with me.
- I didn't do anything.

55
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,108
I said I want you to come with me.

56
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,388
Come on.

57
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:54,755
Gatineau, come with us.

58
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,480
Down there. Quick.

59
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,560
Move it.

60
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Get down.

61
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,228
Give him a shot of Ephemerol.

62
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,328
Come on.

63
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,280
OK.

64
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
(Thunderclap)

65
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,505
Take it easy.
All we need is to get stopped by a cop.

66
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:20,029
It would serve him right. Why the hell
do they have to send us to the old factory?

67
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:26,060
If this guy's a scanner, they don't want him
down at Central. They're afraid of him.

68
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
He is a scanner.

69
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,000
Hey, where's Security 2?

70
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,908
He's moving up fast on the left.

71
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:39,303
Hey, man, what's happening?

72
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,525
Ray. What the hell's the matter with you?

73
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,114
You gotta pull back behind him, man.
Come on.

74
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,295
Ray, I'm gonna kill you if you don't do it.

75
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,110
Ray.

76
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Oh, my God.

77
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:08,826
Don't stop. Move it.

78
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:11,816
No, we gotta get him out of there.

79
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,107
(Shouting in distance)

80
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:24,207
Come on now, let's go.

81
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:26,428
There are people inside.

82
00:15:26,528 --> 00:15:28,528
Get up.

83
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,789
Let's get out of here, man.
Do you want to get us killed?

84
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:42,034
All right, now. Pipe down. All right.

85
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,944
Last night, we at ConSec
chose to reveal to the outside world...

86
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:52,399
...our work with those telepathic curiosities
known as scanners.

87
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,158
The result, six corpses...

88
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,786
...and a substantial loss in credibility
for our organization.

89
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:07,229
So this morning we have a new director
of internal security, Mr. Braedon Keller.

90
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,066
Thank you.

91
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,385
Mr. Trevellyan, gentlemen,

92
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:14,669
we're in the business
of international security.

93
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:17,587
We deal in weaponry and private armies.

94
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:21,869
We do not trade
in fantasy and pipe dreams.

95
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:26,585
Let us leave the development of dolphins
and freaks as weapons of espionage...

96
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:28,426
...to others.

97
00:17:28,526 --> 00:17:32,065
With all due respect to Dr. Paul Ruth.

98
00:17:32,165 --> 00:17:37,520
I recommend that we drop
our scanner programme immediately, sir.

99
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,435
Dr. Ruth, what's your response?

100
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,709
Mr. Keller, who composed
our audience last night?

101
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:49,107
We had 25 financial and political VIPs
from all over North America.

102
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:51,947
Were these VIPs carefully screened?

103
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:55,665
The screening process used
was very sophisticated, yes.

104
00:17:55,765 --> 00:17:59,845
Yet an assassin managed
to infiltrate this group.

105
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,365
Yes.
- And kill six of our people?

106
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:07,469
Yes.
- How did he kill them?

107
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:12,584
We have reason to believe
he used scanning techniques.

108
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:15,404
Then do you suggest, Mr. Keller,

109
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,748
that this highly skilled
assassin, very deadly,

110
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,624
who embarrassed us all in front of
the community we were trying to impress...

111
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:25,270
...was himself a scanner?

112
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,370
We believe so, yes.

113
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:30,259
That, gentlemen, is my response.

114
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,389
The weapons capability
of these telepathic...

115
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,705
Curiosities?

116
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:38,805
...is obvious.

117
00:18:38,848 --> 00:18:46,946
If I may, Doctor? Your programme is based
on a list of 236 known scanners, is it not?

118
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:49,046
It is.

119
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:54,467
Of that number... Of that number,
how many are now working with us?

120
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,567
As of last night, none.

121
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,466
Well, then, we don't even have
a programme to drop, do we?

122
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:04,828
It shouldn't be very painful for anyone.

123
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:09,545
ConSec Surveillance has gradually lost
contact with all the names on our list.

124
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:12,270
I submit that this is not an accident.

125
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,985
I think we've lost them to a programme
far in advance of ours.

126
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:18,085
(Muttering)...

127
00:19:18,128 --> 00:19:21,388
You might elaborate, Dr. Ruth.
- In my study of the situation

128
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:23,508
I've come to the conclusion...

129
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:27,305
...that there is a scanner underground
developed at North America.

130
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:31,068
It has an organization that's well motivated,
it has a leader.

131
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:34,705
That's ridiculous. You can't get
two of them to sit in the same room...

132
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:36,669
...without going berserk.

133
00:19:36,769 --> 00:19:40,544
You're making
a very provocative allegation, Dr. Ruth.

134
00:19:40,644 --> 00:19:42,466
Who controls this group?

135
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:45,546
If you study the descriptions in this report,

136
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:49,726
you'll find that you probably met him
last night.

137
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,066
His name is Darryl Revok.

138
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,166
And he was on our list.

139
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,627
This is total fiction. Mr. Trevellyan...

140
00:19:57,727 --> 00:20:01,382
One moment, Mr. Keller.
What do you suggest?

141
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,840
Eliminate the competition.
- How?

142
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,584
Contact a scanner who is as yet
unknown to the underground,

143
00:20:09,684 --> 00:20:15,349
convert him to our cause, and then send
him out to infiltrate the underground.

144
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:17,346
(Keller) Convert him, Doctor? How?

145
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:21,427
They're all pathetic social misfits.
Unstable, unreliable.

146
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:25,304
That is because their unique gifts
are not understood, Mr. Keller.

147
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:28,429
There's one point about which
there's no doubt at all,

148
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:31,674
and that is that ConSec was attacked.

149
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,670
For our own peace of mind,
we have to retaliate in some way.

150
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:40,146
And I think Dr. Ruth's suggestion
is a very interesting one.

151
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:46,679
Except that... we don't have
any scanners left to send into the field.

152
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,230
As a matter of fact...

153
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,716
I do have one still unaffiliated.

154
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
A very special one.

155
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,035
I don't suppose you speak much.

156
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
(Revok) No.

157
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:17,648
It's not surprising.

158
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:21,906
With all those other voices in your head,
how can you hear your own voice?

159
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:25,576
How can you develop a self, a personality?

160
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
How do you feel?

161
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,474
I feel... crystal clear.

162
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,477
How do you like it? Clarity.

163
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
I'm not sure.

164
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,149
I think I'm a bit afraid.

165
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:47,276
Why?

166
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,067
I feel so exposed.

167
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:54,268
I can hear myself.

168
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:56,918
You hear your own voice?
- Yes.

169
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:59,559
Good.
- You called me a scanner.

170
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
What is that?

171
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,635
A freak of nature,
born with a certain form of ESP.

172
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,919
A derangement of the synapses,
which we call telepathy.

173
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,508
It could be a disease, possibly.

174
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:24,858
Or a result of radiation.
We don't really know why.

175
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
Who are you?

176
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,245
My name is Dr. Paul Ruth.

177
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,506
I'm a psycho-pharmacist by trade,

178
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:39,176
specializing
in the phenomenon of scanners.

179
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,450
The woman in the shopping mall,
what were you doing to her?

180
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,628
I wasn't doing anything to her.

181
00:22:49,728 --> 00:22:51,785
It was her.

182
00:22:51,885 --> 00:22:56,192
She was... forcing me...

183
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
'To what?'

184
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
'To think about her.'

185
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,466
'The 50 people that were here
appeared to disturb you.

186
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:09,706
'Why was that?'
- 'They talked too loud.

187
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,510
'They talked, and they talked...'
- 'Really?

188
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,825
'I didn't see their lips move, did you?'

189
00:23:14,925 --> 00:23:20,589
'No, it was the other voices, the ones
without lips. They were drowning me.'

190
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:22,875
I couldn't stop them.

191
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,667
The injection I gave you, with the needle,

192
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:31,422
what happened to the voices?
- They stopped.

193
00:23:31,448 --> 00:23:35,427
The drug is called Ephemerol.

194
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:37,628
It's a scanner-suppressant.

195
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:41,308
It does nothing
when it's given to ordinary human beings.

196
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:45,829
When given to a scanner,
it prevents the flow of telepathy.

197
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:48,906
It stops the voices.

198
00:23:49,006 --> 00:23:52,625
It can help you.
- How do you know these things?

199
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:55,234
It's my profession.

200
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,985
This is Mr. Keller.

201
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,975
Will my car be ready this evening?

202
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,075
'Tell us what you did, please, Darryl.'

203
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,787
'I drilled a hole in my head.'
- 'Where? '

204
00:24:34,887 --> 00:24:38,712
'It's kind of obvious, isn't it? Right here.'

205
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,145
'Why did you do it, Darryl?
Why did you drill the hole?'

206
00:24:43,245 --> 00:24:45,245
'Too much pressure.

207
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
'To lessen pressure.'

208
00:24:48,608 --> 00:24:55,578
'You wanted to let the pressure out? You
wanted to let something out of your head?'

209
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,146
'Listen, I can't get anything past you, can I?'

210
00:24:59,246 --> 00:25:01,747
'You wanted to let something
out of your head?'

211
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:03,847
'Uh-huh.'
- 'What?'

212
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:05,926
'People.

213
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,269
'The people in my head.
They're from the Devil.'

214
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:14,369
'You mean the voices?'

215
00:25:14,408 --> 00:25:18,829
'No. All people. Arms, legs, hands.'

216
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:21,347
'What's that you've put over the hole?'

217
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:23,719
'It's a door. I put an eye on it so they won't...

218
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:25,948
...know it's a door and
they can't get back in...

219
00:25:26,048 --> 00:25:32,508
'cos they'll see the eye, you know...'
- 'Do you think that will fool them? '

220
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,306
'Sure. Sure it will.

221
00:25:34,406 --> 00:25:38,866
'I mean, sure it will, you know.'
- 'I mean, if that's the only way...'

222
00:25:38,966 --> 00:25:41,105
'No.

223
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:44,665
'What do you know?
You don't know nothing, do you?

224
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:51,140
'You want to see if I can do it again?
Do you? You want to see how I did it?

225
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,120
'Aaaargh.'

226
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,910
'Darryl...'
- 'Get your hands off me.

227
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:24,109
'Get your hands... Get your hands off me.

228
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,249
'Get your hands off me.'

229
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,840
(Thunder in distance)

230
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,625
That's me, isn't it?

231
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:47,725
As you were...

232
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,835
...without Ephemerol, without guidance.

233
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,880
Is he still like that?

234
00:26:54,928 --> 00:26:58,188
Worse.
- How could he be?

235
00:26:58,288 --> 00:27:01,585
At the age of 22,
he was extremely self-destructive.

236
00:27:01,685 --> 00:27:05,869
Now, at the age of 35,
he is simply destructive.

237
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:10,186
In many ways, Cameron, he is your enemy.

238
00:27:10,286 --> 00:27:12,286
And mine.

239
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,668
But I don't even know him.

240
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:18,991
He... knows you.

241
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,309
Somehow he was able to gather
a master list...

242
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:27,827
...of all the scanners who were ever born.

243
00:27:27,927 --> 00:27:29,868
He has sought them out, one by one,

244
00:27:29,968 --> 00:27:33,692
asked them to join him
in an insane crusade...

245
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:37,100
...to destroy the society that created him.

246
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
And me?

247
00:27:39,248 --> 00:27:42,705
He was looking for you but I found you first.
You can help me.

248
00:27:42,805 --> 00:27:44,669
I don't understand.

249
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,049
All the scanners...

250
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:49,109
...who didn't agree to
join him were murdered.

251
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:55,348
These murders represent a loss to mankind
of the most spectacular human beings...

252
00:27:55,448 --> 00:27:58,027
...that ever walked the face of this planet.

253
00:27:58,127 --> 00:28:01,186
You, Cameron,
and your brothers and sisters,

254
00:28:01,286 --> 00:28:07,780
can bring a glory and a brilliance to our
society that has never been seen before.

255
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,155
We must stop Revok. Now.

256
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,880
(Whistle)

257
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,275
ConSec are not ready
to give up their programme.

258
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,788
Paul Ruth... came up with a secret weapon.

259
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:05,888
What?

260
00:29:05,928 --> 00:29:08,667
Someone you've been looking for, I think.

261
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:11,997
A scanner. Calls himself Cameron Vale.

262
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,428
I've seen him.

263
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:19,928
And Ruth knew exactly where to find him.

264
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,005
He's in indoctrination right now.

265
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,260
Can he do anything?
What kind of shape is he in?

266
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,360
He seems to function.

267
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,425
But he's nothing to worry about.

268
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:35,525
He's weak.

269
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Very weak.

270
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,305
Welcome to our little psychic gymnasium...

271
00:29:44,405 --> 00:29:46,545
...(Heart monitor beeping)...

272
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:48,645
...Cameron Vale.

273
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,880
And please meet...

274
00:29:53,928 --> 00:29:57,037
...yoga master Dieter Tautz.

275
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,545
Mr. Tautz has kindly consented
to be your psychic sparring partner.

276
00:30:06,645 --> 00:30:11,270
He has publicly demonstrated
on many occasions.

277
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,229
By the power of his will,
he can control his heart rate,

278
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:18,827
his alpha-wave rhythm,

279
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:23,828
and many other supposedly uncontrollable
functions of the human body.

280
00:30:23,928 --> 00:30:26,138
Are we ready?
- Just about.

281
00:30:26,165 --> 00:30:28,165
Proceed.

282
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:33,053
If you'd be kind enough
to sit facing this gentleman here.

283
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
I want you...

284
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,305
I want you to slowly release your scan.

285
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:48,789
Slowly, with focus.

286
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,108
I want it to touch... his heart.

287
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:56,098
But not his brain. You understand?

288
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,830
Telepathy is not mind-reading.

289
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,267
It is the direct linking...

290
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:04,947
...of two nervous systems...

291
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:07,047
...separated by space.

292
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,272
I want you to make a link...

293
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,029
...from your brain... to his heart.

294
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,590
I want your brain to make his heart...

295
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,320
...beat faster.

296
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,594
If his heart beats too quickly,

297
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,430
then he will take over control of his heart...

298
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
...and slow it down.

299
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:43,348
Don't worry about him. All you have to do...

300
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,425
...is make his heart beat faster.

301
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:50,525
Fast...

302
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,080
Fast.

303
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Fast.

304
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,229
Fast.

305
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:02,359
Faster. Faster...

306
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
Faster. Faster.

307
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,309
Faster.

308
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,760
Aaargh.

309
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,105
End your scan.

310
00:32:25,205 --> 00:32:27,205
End it.

311
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,600
Stop him.
- End it.

312
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,560
End it.

313
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,640
(Heart monitor beeping steadily)

314
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,548
You were right, Dr. Ruth.

315
00:32:52,648 --> 00:32:54,648
It was easy.

316
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,746
This man's name is Benjamin Pierce.

317
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:08,456
These photographs were taken in a prison
for the criminally insane.

318
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
There's another one.

319
00:33:13,128 --> 00:33:16,266
This is a plaster cast of him
at present on display...

320
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:18,831
...in the Crostic Art Gallery

321
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,640
He's our only lead.

322
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,885
A known scanner who may or may not
be part of Revok's underground.

323
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Why was he in prison?

324
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,935
He tried to kill his entire family.

325
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,228
His father, his sister,

326
00:33:37,328 --> 00:33:39,226
mother.

327
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:45,429
At the age of ten. That was in 1958.
A few years later, he was released.

328
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
They say here...

329
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,145
'Rehabilitation through art.'

330
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,987
The man has incredible power, doesn't he?

331
00:34:25,087 --> 00:34:27,087
Power?

332
00:34:27,128 --> 00:34:29,148
Oh, yes, he does.

333
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,248
I'm Arno Crostic.

334
00:34:31,326 --> 00:34:34,301
I'm pleased you came to my gallery.

335
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,325
Are you an aficionado of Benjamin Pierce?

336
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,384
I'm interested in buying this piece
for my apartment in Paris.

337
00:34:42,484 --> 00:34:44,705
Yes?
- I don't think it'll work out...

338
00:34:44,805 --> 00:34:48,630
...unless I can get to meet the artist first.

339
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
I'm afraid, no.

340
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:55,030
I hope it won't prejudice you
against acquiring this piece...

341
00:34:55,130 --> 00:35:01,145
...but I would lose Benjamin Pierce for good
if I even approached him with the idea.

342
00:35:01,245 --> 00:35:04,305
You see, it's part of our agreement.

343
00:35:04,326 --> 00:35:06,709
He will not meet his public.

344
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,627
Maybe you could just
tell me where he lives.

345
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:14,989
Then I could approach him myself
and you wouldn't be involved.

346
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:17,089
I'm afraid I can't.

347
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,951
Then maybe you could just
think about where he lives.

348
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Excuse me.

349
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,460
I'm suddenly... feeling ill.

350
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,440
Arno, what's the matter?

351
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,709
Are you OK?
- I will be all right.

352
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:53,388
Let me take you back to your office.
You've got to lie down.

353
00:35:53,488 --> 00:35:56,718
That's it, take my arm. I'll help you.

354
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Benjamin Pierce?

355
00:37:10,848 --> 00:37:13,313
Why don't you leave me alone?

356
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,080
I need some help.

357
00:37:24,128 --> 00:37:27,953
You're the only one that could give it to me.

358
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,240
Is that right?

359
00:37:30,288 --> 00:37:32,635
Me?
- Yes.

360
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,794
(Cackles)

361
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,605
Then I think you're in big trouble, chum.

362
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,780
I've heard you know
a man named Darryl Revok.

363
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,196
Who are you?

364
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
I was told...

365
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,375
...you were coming to
pay me a visit, Mr. Vale.

366
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,400
How did you know that?

367
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,380
How did I know that? Well...

368
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
I have friends.

369
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,948
I don't want them...

370
00:38:42,048 --> 00:38:44,048
...but I have them.

371
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Scanner friends?

372
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,028
What do you mean by that?

373
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:00,190
I'm one of you.

374
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
You're one of me.
- Yes.

375
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
You know what I think?

376
00:39:14,528 --> 00:39:18,693
I think you'd better tell me
what you really want.

377
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,675
It's the voices in my head.
They're driving me crazy.

378
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,631
How do you stop them, your voices?

379
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,120
My art.

380
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,911
My art keeps me sane.

381
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,560
My art...

382
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,680
Sane...

383
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,709
I don't have anything like this.

384
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:03,124
That's why I have to find Darryl Revok.

385
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,865
You,

386
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:10,965
my friend...

387
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,880
...are a liar.

388
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,308
Get out.
- Look...

389
00:40:18,408 --> 00:40:23,763
I'm not leaving until you tell me
where I can find Darryl Revok.

390
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
No?

391
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:29,111
All right. Well, then, I'll get out.

392
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,070
Aaaargh.

393
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,440
Aaargh.

394
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,664
Ow.

395
00:40:56,764 --> 00:40:58,764
No.

396
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,147

404
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,468
Good evening, sir. Can I help you?

405
00:43:15,568 --> 00:43:17,508
Are there any messages for me?

406
00:43:17,608 --> 00:43:20,469
Your name, sir?
- Cameron Vale.

407
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:22,864
And your room number?
- 802.

408
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,290
Yes, this package is for you, sir.

My name is Cameron Vale.

413
00:45:21,168 --> 00:45:24,908
I've got to talk to Kim Obrist.
- Come on in.

414
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,025
Oh, God... They killed Ben Pierce.

415
00:45:40,125 --> 00:45:43,396
Yes.
- Come on upstairs.

416
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,120
Just wait here a sec.

417
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,306
Kim, Revok got to Ben Pierce. He's dead.

418
00:46:06,406 --> 00:46:10,669
This guy's name is Cameron Vale.
I scanned him. He's for real.

419
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,320
He was there when it happened.

420
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,360
Sit down.

421
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,920
I know you.

422
00:46:35,968 --> 00:46:38,008
You were at the gallery.

423
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,546
You were looking for Pierce.

424
00:46:40,646 --> 00:46:42,646
I need help.

425

Hurry.

Get in.

Kim.

Kim, come on. Kim.

446
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,240
Now I know...

447
00:50:04,288 --> 00:50:06,753
...what it feels like to die.

448
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,309
Everywhere you go, somebody dies.
Who are you?

449
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:13,226
Who sent you?

450
00:50:13,326 --> 00:50:15,668
I'm a scanner.
- Who sent you?

451
00:50:15,768 --> 00:50:18,470
I was found by ConSec.

452
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:21,800
ConSec?
- They wanted me to find Revok.

453
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:24,399
I think they want to kill him.

454
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:27,645
But they never told me about you.

Excuse me, outside, ma'am.
OK, let's move out.

470

We'll be all right here for a while.

00:53:30,928 --> 00:53:32,928
It doesn't matter.

472
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,920
It's finished.

473
00:53:35,968 --> 00:53:39,396
And nothing can stop Revok now.

474
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,820
We're the dream, he's the nightmare.

475
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,318
There's still us. I can help you.

476
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,905
We can destroy Revok together.

477
00:53:58,005 --> 00:54:00,005
You?

478
00:54:00,048 --> 00:54:02,048
You're barely human.

479
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,360
I'm sorry.

480
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,629
I'm sorry, but you don't understand.
You don't know Revok,

481
00:54:17,729 --> 00:54:19,668
you don't know how evil he is,

482
00:54:19,768 --> 00:54:23,508
how powerful he is, you
don't know anything.

483
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,640
What are you doing?

484
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:28,853
He must have something
that will lead us to Revok.

485
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,120
Us? No, not me.

486
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,320
There it is.

487
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,480
That's it.

488
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,520
That's it.

489
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,085
Dr. Ruth, telephone call, sir.
You can take it right here.

490
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,560
Yes.

491
00:58:53,608 --> 00:58:55,608
'It's Cameron Vale.'

492
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,160
We missed you.

493
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:01,425
I made a breakthrough to Revok.

494
00:59:01,525 --> 00:59:06,860
I want to come in. I want to bring you
an informant from Revok's group.

495
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,635
That's excellent.
I'll arrange for you to be brought in.

496
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,350
Can you call me back in about ten minutes?

497
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,955
OK. Goodbye, Dr. Ruth.

498
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,520
All set?

499
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:28,568
Ten minutes.

500
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,585
(Whistle)

501
00:59:51,685 --> 00:59:54,310
We may have developed a serious problem.

502
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:58,467
Vale's coming in. He says
he has an informant from your group.

503
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:00,567
Now, is that possible?

504
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,720
No, he's lying.

505
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,185
Then why is he coming in?

506
01:00:07,285 --> 01:00:09,285
Maybe he's homesick.

507
01:00:09,328 --> 01:00:14,148
Vale must know something or his informant
does. It could be about me and you.

508
01:00:14,248 --> 01:00:17,386
Then you'd better be the one
to interrogate the informant.

509
01:00:17,486 --> 01:00:20,546
Ruth will talk to Vale.
I won't be able to prevent that.

510
01:00:20,646 --> 01:00:25,321
If Ruth finds out anything,
anything at all... kill him.

511
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,680
Really?

512
01:00:29,728 --> 01:00:32,749
I thought you didn't want...
- Kill him.

513
01:00:32,849 --> 01:00:34,849
Really.

514
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:47,706
One-six, Central,
this is ConSec two-niner. Clear to land.

515
01:00:47,806 --> 01:00:53,070
'ConSec two-niner, this is ConSec Central.
Security is in place. You are clear to land.

516
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,720
'Repeat, affirmative to land.'

517
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:54,309
I'm afraid I'm going to have to
give you both an injection of Ephemerol.

518
01:01:54,409 --> 01:01:58,025
Well, Braedon, no apologies,
no vote of confidence,

519
01:01:58,125 --> 01:02:00,505
and my man brought back the goods.

520
01:02:00,605 --> 01:02:04,225
We save the party until
we've unwrapped the presents.

521
01:02:04,325 --> 01:02:07,748
It won't take long.
I have a way with these creatures.

522
01:02:07,848 --> 01:02:09,848
I know that.

523
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,440
So has Trevellyan.

524
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,149
That's why he's asked me
to take the informant.

525
01:02:19,249 --> 01:02:21,305
You can do what you like with Vale.

526
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:27,185
What if that won't work?
Police-state tactics simply won't work, sir.

527
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,465
Really? Why don't you send a letter
to the Board about that, Doctor?

528
01:02:32,565 --> 01:02:35,795
I'm sure they'd love to hear from you.

529
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,780
(Knocking on door)
- Come in.

530
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,560
Welcome.

531
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,240
Congratulations.

532
01:02:51,288 --> 01:02:53,228
It's good to have you back home.

533
01:02:53,328 --> 01:02:55,747
Where's the girl? She should be here.

534
01:02:55,847 --> 01:02:58,986
She's in another room, being interrogated.

535
01:02:59,086 --> 01:03:01,296
I thought it would be you.

536
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,150
So did I. That's why I
made sure the needles

537
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,946
I gave you both were harmless.

538
01:03:06,046 --> 01:03:09,425
She'll be able
to protect herself if there's any problem.

539
01:03:09,525 --> 01:03:11,266
Why did you do that?

540
01:03:11,366 --> 01:03:14,875
Gesture of trust, dear friend.

541
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,867
I have my own methods.

542
01:03:18,967 --> 01:03:20,908
And I've nothing to hide.

543
01:03:21,008 --> 01:03:23,008
Nothing at all to hide.

544
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,868
Not even the RIPE programme?

545
01:03:26,968 --> 01:03:28,968
The what?

546
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:35,500
Do you know of a drug laboratory
called Biocarbon Amalgamate?

547
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:39,036
Yes, of course. I founded it in 1942.

548
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,510
You?
- I sold it to ConSec. That's why I'm here.

549
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:50,675
Let's say that
we have a... genial working relationship.

550
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,508
Do you know what that lab does?

551
01:03:54,608 --> 01:03:58,108
It's been so long
since I've been in touch with them...

552
01:03:58,208 --> 01:03:59,535
As far as I know,

553
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:02,905
they make some sort
of chemical weaponry,

554
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,869
among other things.

555
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:08,228
It manufactures Ephemerol
for Darryl Revok.

556
01:04:08,328 --> 01:04:11,303
It may even be run by Darryl Revok.

557
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,920
That's impossible.

558
01:04:13,968 --> 01:04:16,872
No. I was there.

559
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,060
I took the place of one of Revok's men.

560
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,880
I saw Revok in the control room.

561
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,535
The production of Ephemerol
is computerized.

562
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:33,500
It's being manufactured
and sent out in huge tankers.

563
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,420
Ephemerol is being sent out?

564
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,628
Sent out where?

565
01:04:44,728 --> 01:04:47,227
The answer is in your own computer.

566
01:04:47,327 --> 01:04:51,466
The programme that controls everything
is called RIPE.

567
01:04:51,566 --> 01:04:53,946
And it's a ConSec programme.

568
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:01,633
That means that someone,
here at ConSec, is a traitor.

569
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,895
That someone is working with Revok.

570
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:16,266
I want you to access the RIPE programme.
I do not have ConSec computer clearance.

571
01:05:16,366 --> 01:05:18,388
Neither do I.

572
01:05:18,488 --> 01:05:20,466
You do have a nervous system.

573
01:05:20,566 --> 01:05:22,994
So does a computer.

574
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:29,916
And you can scan the computer
as you would...

575
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,520
...another human being.

576
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,320
Come.

577
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:58,594
Hello.
- Hello.

578
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,005
What a pleasant surprise.

579
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,240
You're very attractive.

580
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,875
OK, let's do it the formal way.

581
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Your name.

582
01:06:15,448 --> 01:06:17,448
Kim Obrist.

583
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,640
Your name?

584
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,800
Not relevant.

585
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:34,066
Now... Tell me everything you know
about Darryl Revok's organization.

586
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:36,631
Before I tell you anything...

587
01:06:36,687 --> 01:06:39,666
I want to know
how you're going to protect me.

588
01:06:39,766 --> 01:06:43,421
When Revok finds out that I've come here...

589
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,845
...he'll try and kill me.

590
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,560
Miss Obrist,

591
01:06:50,608 --> 01:06:52,989
your best protection...

592
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,227
...is to tell us everything we need to know.

593
01:06:57,327 --> 01:06:58,986
As soon as you do.

594
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:02,656
Revok will cease to be a threat to anyone.

595
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,040
Not good enough.

596
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,680
Revok's people are everywhere...

597
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,560
...and that scares me.

598
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,385
To be honest with you, Kim...

599
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,545
...the only one you should be afraid of...

600
01:07:21,645 --> 01:07:23,645
...is me.

601
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,630
Why should I be afraid of you?

602
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,720
I came here of my own free will.

603
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,560
Because...

604
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,115
I know you're not what you say you are.

605
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,975
I want to see someone else.

606
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,175
Listen to me. Listen to me.

607
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:01,189
Now, I have acquaintances
in Revok's group. They tell me...

608
01:08:01,289 --> 01:08:04,825
They tell me
that you have never been one of them.

609
01:08:04,925 --> 01:08:07,593
Why are you here?

610
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,680
Why?

611
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,275
Goodbye, Kim.

612
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,910
(Alarm hooter)

613
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,985
It must be Kim. Where is she?

614
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,468
Where is she?
- This is more important.

615
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:13,568
No.

616
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,026
(Thinking) 'No, this is more important.

617
01:09:21,126 --> 01:09:23,867
'The computer is more important.

618
01:09:23,967 --> 01:09:25,908
'Access the RIPE programme.

619
01:09:26,008 --> 01:09:28,008
'More important...

620
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,989
'But the RIPE programme is the past.

621
01:09:33,089 --> 01:09:38,614
'Therefore to access the RIPE programme
is to access the past, no?

622
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,515
'Access the past...

623
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,987
'Access the past...'

624
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,087
(Alarm continues)

625
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,400
Security.

626
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:00,200
The scanners. Find them and kill them.
Put it on the air.

627
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,600
Find them and kill them.

628
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,390
It mustn't happen again.

629
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,787
It's always been there inside me,

630
01:10:15,887 --> 01:10:20,732
lurking away, sucking out my joy
and rotting my successes.

631
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,586
Cameron...

632
01:10:25,686 --> 01:10:27,686
Poor Cameron.

633
01:10:27,728 --> 01:10:30,363
I have a way with you, Cameron.

634
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,600
It mustn't happen again.

635
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,116
RIPE. Ripe, indeed.

636
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,910
The RIPE programme... must be stopped.

637
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:56,826
This isn't the same thing, you understand.
Not the same thing at all.

638
01:10:56,926 --> 01:10:58,926
It's different.

639
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,155
The first time was an accident.

640
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,400
Fortunate for some.

641
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,400
Unfortunate for others.

642
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,511
The RIPE programme is cold and cruel.

643
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,640
Very...

644
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,200
Very cold...

645
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,040
Very cruel...

646
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,640
...(Gunshot)...

647
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,946
What happened?
- Keller tried to kill me.

648
01:12:16,046 --> 01:12:18,634
Keller? Then he's the one.

649
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,525
(Distorted) Oh, my God...

650
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:46,460
...(Distorted) Mom, what
are you doing here?

651
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,996
I'm sorry, Mom.

652
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,067
Mom...

653
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:56,167
I didn't...

654
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:58,208
I didn't mean...

655
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,440
Mom...

656
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,995
...(Distorted) I didn't mean it, Mom. Please...

657
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,390
There's blood on my hand.

658
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:15,625
Secure the computer room.

659
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:17,725
Blood on my hand...

660
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,800
What's going on?

661
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,210
What the hell is going on?

662
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,900
It's the scanners, sir. They're out.

663
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,188
Is this the only way we can do it?

664
01:13:53,288 --> 01:13:59,323
If we don't plug into the computer now,
they're going to reprogramme it.

665
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,560
What does that mean?

666
01:14:18,608 --> 01:14:19,608
It means...

667
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:21,389
...someone has reprogrammed
the computer...

668
01:14:21,489 --> 01:14:24,307
...so that the RIPE programme
is locked away inside.

669
01:14:24,407 --> 01:14:28,232
He threw away the key
and plugged the keyhole.

670
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,905
Try it again. Try it again.

671
01:14:31,005 --> 01:14:33,005
OK.

672
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,267
That's as deep into it as we're going to get.

673
01:14:50,367 --> 01:14:53,745
Hey, Lee, punch up your internal monitor.

674
01:14:53,845 --> 01:14:56,820
Access is IM 863.
- Why, what is it?

675
01:14:56,889 --> 01:15:02,414
Someone's inside this thing right now,
getting the RIPE programme.

676
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:16,907
How can this happen?
This room is max security.

677
01:15:17,007 --> 01:15:20,407
We're plugged into the telephone system.

678
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:26,795
Anybody who has the proper access codes
could get in here long-distance.

679
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,228
Someone's getting in there right now?
- Yeah.

680
01:15:30,328 --> 01:15:32,328
Damn.

681
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,880
It's him.

682
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:14,745
It's Vale. He's inside.

683
01:16:14,845 --> 01:16:17,735
Is that possible?
- It's got to be.

684
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,588
It's got to be. I want to hurt him.

685
01:16:20,688 --> 01:16:24,789
How can we hurt him before he gets out?
- Hurt him? I don't understand.

686
01:16:24,889 --> 01:16:29,186
Vale's nervous system and the computer's
nervous system are joined.

687
01:16:29,286 --> 01:16:31,069
He's scanning it.

688
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:33,108
I want to cripple them both.

689
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,673
Or maybe kill them both. How?

690
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,227
Well, I don't know if it's what you want,

691
01:16:39,327 --> 01:16:42,945
but I could override
the max security self-destruct.

692
01:16:43,045 --> 01:16:45,826
It blows all the circuits,
in case data is taken...

693
01:16:45,926 --> 01:16:47,985
...by unauthorized and unfriendly forces.

694
01:16:48,085 --> 01:16:50,667
Do it now.
- That would entail a total loss...

695
01:16:50,767 --> 01:16:52,746
...of all programmes in the ConSec system.

696
01:16:52,846 --> 01:16:57,011
I'd need written authorization
from ConSec Leader.

697
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,468
Mister, this is your authorization.

698
01:16:59,568 --> 01:17:01,568
Sit down.

699
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,588
Do it now or I'll kill you.

700
01:17:09,688 --> 01:17:11,983
Yes, sir, I'm doing it now.

701
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:43,020
Sir, I have to finish it over there.

702
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:14,445
Sir, this is the last step. Are you sure?
- Do it.

703
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,868
There's no need for that. It's all very quiet.

704
01:18:30,968 --> 01:18:33,433
It's just internal switching.

705
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:38,877
Really? No one's ever switched off
a scanner before.

706
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,840
Oh, shit.

707
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,784
See? I told you,

708
01:19:28,884 --> 01:19:30,884
no fireworks.

709
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:40,080
(Siren)...

710
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:36,370
I'll go find the doctor.
- All right, I'll keep an eye on the door.

711
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,265
Excuse me.
Is the receptionist coming back soon?

712
01:21:50,365 --> 01:21:53,000
Erm, yeah, I guess so.
- Thanks.

713
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:37,347
Please. I'll be with you in a moment.
- I have to talk to you right now.

714
01:22:37,447 --> 01:22:40,273
Would you please get out of here?

715
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,200
It's about this drug, Dr. Frane.

716
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:50,400
I understand
you've been prescribing it to some patients.

717
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:55,125
Excuse me. I'll be back in just a moment.

718
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,154
Just relax. Read a magazine.

719
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:11,385
Where did you get this?
What do you want with me? Who are you?

720
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,269
What happened?

721
01:23:16,369 --> 01:23:18,369
I was scanned.

722
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,789
The woman in the... in the waiting room...

723
01:23:23,889 --> 01:23:26,148
She scanned you?

724
01:23:26,248 --> 01:23:28,248
No, not her.

725
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,920
Her child.

726
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,140
Her unborn child scanned me.

727
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:40,228
That's what the RIPE programme is.

728
01:23:40,328 --> 01:23:45,900
The doctors on the computer list are giving
Ephemerol to their pregnant patients.

729
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,635
I don't understand.
- Ephemerol.

730
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,415
Ephemerol is creating new scanners.

731
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,190
Hold still.
- Ow. God...

732
01:23:57,290 --> 01:24:00,426
Hold still.
- Oh, God... Ow.

733
01:24:00,526 --> 01:24:02,526
OK. OK.

734
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:06,295
Oh, God...
- Come on, let's get out of here.

735
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,280
Come on.

736
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,890
Come on, you can make it. Come on.

737
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,720
Kim... Kim...

738
01:24:18,768 --> 01:24:20,768
Vale.

739
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,840
Kim...

740
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,320
Sleeping beauty awakes.

741
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,305
Where is Kim?

742
01:24:53,405 --> 01:24:55,405
The next room.

743
01:24:55,448 --> 01:24:58,083
She'll be awake in a few hours.

744
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:02,185
We don't want anyone in here with us.

745
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,224
This is just between you and me.

746
01:25:05,324 --> 01:25:08,588
Where's your partner, Keller?
He should be here.

747
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:13,278
Keller? It seems he died
when you blew up his computer.

748
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:17,505
By the way, that was very impressive.

749
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:21,593
Keller murdered Dr. Ruth.
He deserved to die.

750
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,627
You shouldn't mourn the doctor's death.
Celebrate it with me.

751
01:25:26,727 --> 01:25:33,187
Dr. Ruth was a great man.
He tried to help us. He helped me.

752
01:25:33,287 --> 01:25:38,550
Great man. There's only one person on
earth who tried to help you, and that's me.

753
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:41,669
You?. You sent your soldiers out to kill me.

754
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:46,189
Never. Never you.
I've spent years looking for you.

755
01:25:46,289 --> 01:25:48,705
Then when Keller told
me Ruth had dressed...

756
01:25:48,805 --> 01:25:51,108
...you up and sent you
out as an amateur spy.

757
01:25:51,208 --> 01:25:56,308
I tried to take care of you,
look after you, guide you to me.

758
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,690
Now, why would you try to do that?

759
01:26:01,727 --> 01:26:03,915
Who's your mother?

760
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,840
I don't know.

761
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,546
Who's your father?
- I don't know.

762
01:26:14,646 --> 01:26:17,147
What was your first childhood memory?

763
01:26:17,247 --> 01:26:19,247
I don't have any.

764
01:26:19,288 --> 01:26:22,346
No, you don't.
And it's no accident that you don't.

765
01:26:22,446 --> 01:26:24,446
You were kept on ice.

766
01:26:24,488 --> 01:26:28,706
It wasn't till ConSec had trouble putting
me away that they thawed you out.

767
01:26:28,806 --> 01:26:32,228
You've been monitored all your life,
allowed to live like garbage.

768
01:26:32,328 --> 01:26:36,270
Scum. He knew where you were
but it wasn't till he needed you...

769
01:26:36,370 --> 01:26:40,638
...that he hauled you out of the slime.
- Who?

770
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,080
Your father.

771
01:26:44,128 --> 01:26:46,156
Dr. Paul Ruth.

772
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,596
Our father.

773
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,600
No...

774
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,028
You're my brother, Cameron.

775
01:27:01,128 --> 01:27:03,026
My kid brother.

776
01:27:03,126 --> 01:27:05,588
No...

777
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:16,035
Sit down. I want to show you something.

778
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:27,985
This was a test campaign
used in 1947 to market a new product.

779
01:27:28,085 --> 01:27:30,085
The product was a drug,

780
01:27:30,128 --> 01:27:32,707
a tranquillizer called Ephemerol.

781
01:27:32,807 --> 01:27:35,669
It was aimed at pregnant women.
If it had worked,

782
01:27:35,769 --> 01:27:38,347
it would have been marketed
all over North America.

783
01:27:38,447 --> 01:27:41,309
But the campaign failed and the drug failed.

784
01:27:41,409 --> 01:27:47,274
It had a side effect on the unborn children.
An invisible side effect.

785
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:50,829
It created scanners.
- Yes.

786
01:27:50,929 --> 01:27:55,944
The man who invented Ephemerol was very
excited by this weird mutation it caused,

787
01:27:56,044 --> 01:28:00,229
and so was ConSec.
They offered to finance his experiments,

788
01:28:00,329 --> 01:28:03,729
so he sold them his company and himself.

789
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:07,188
And that man was Dr. Ruth?

790
01:28:07,288 --> 01:28:09,288
That was Daddy.

791
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:15,910
I said the side effects of Ephemerol were
invisible but that's not completely true.

792
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:18,667
Daddy could see them.
He could see them in us.

793
01:28:18,767 --> 01:28:23,668
He had given the prototype of Ephemerol
to his pregnant wife, our mother,

794
01:28:23,768 --> 01:28:27,225
four years before it hit the market,
and then again a year later.

795
01:28:27,325 --> 01:28:29,625
His children turned out to be difficult,

796
01:28:29,725 --> 01:28:36,580
till he realized that the only thing that would
calm them down was his drug, Ephemerol.

797
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:40,335
That's why we're older than all the others.

798
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:43,070
Not only older, more powerful.

799
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,065
The rest of them,
they're nothing compared to us.

800
01:28:47,165 --> 01:28:49,305
Then what did you need Keller for?

801
01:28:49,405 --> 01:28:52,550
ConSec had hardware, it had contacts.

802
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,228
Keller could see the future.

803
01:28:55,328 --> 01:28:57,328
The future?.

804
01:28:57,368 --> 01:28:59,408
You murdered the future.

805
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,789
That's negative, Cam. Defeatist.

806
01:29:04,889 --> 01:29:07,707
It disappoints me to hear you talk that way.

807
01:29:07,807 --> 01:29:10,387
You're starting to sound like them.

808
01:29:10,487 --> 01:29:16,106
A generation of scanner soldiers is a few
months from being born. We'll find them,

809
01:29:16,206 --> 01:29:17,989
train them to be like us,

810
01:29:18,089 --> 01:29:20,907
not like Obrist and her band of cripples,

811
01:29:21,007 --> 01:29:23,667
bring the world of normals to their knees.

812
01:29:23,767 --> 01:29:29,226
Build an empire so brilliant, so glorious,
we'll be the envy of the whole planet.

813
01:29:29,326 --> 01:29:31,914
You sound just like him.

814
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,480
Like Ruth.

815
01:29:34,528 --> 01:29:37,150
No, not like him. Like...

816
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:39,625
Revok. Darryl Revok.

817
01:29:39,725 --> 01:29:42,792
No... Like him.

818
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:47,865
It's as though he's been
reincarnated in you.

819
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:52,015
You're not listening to me.

820
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,706
You're not cooperating, Cam.

821
01:29:56,806 --> 01:30:00,036
You're not cooperating with me at all.

822
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:08,550
I've been counting on you
for years, Cameron.

823
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:13,585
Tell me you're not going to betray me
like all the rest. Tell me you're not.

824
01:30:13,685 --> 01:30:15,685
No.

825
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:29,228
All right, we're going to do it the scanner
way. I'm going to suck your brain dry.

826
01:30:29,328 --> 01:30:32,269
Everything you are is going to become me.

827
01:30:32,369 --> 01:30:34,708
You're going to be with me, no matter what.

828
01:30:34,808 --> 01:30:39,568
After all, brothers should be close,
don't you think? Hm?

829
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,320
(Distorted growling)

830
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:44,640
Cameron?

831
01:34:44,688 --> 01:34:46,688
Kim.

832
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,592
It's me, Kim. Cameron. I'm here.

833
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,640
We've won.

834
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,160
We've won...
