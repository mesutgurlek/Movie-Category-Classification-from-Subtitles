00:02:44.50,00:04:58.00


00:04:58.50,00:05:00.00
LEADER:[br]Bio-readouts are in the green.

00:05:00.50,00:05:02.00
Looks like she´s alive.

00:05:02.50,00:05:05.00


00:05:05.50,00:05:07.00
There goes our salvage, guys.

00:05:07.50,00:05:35.00


00:05:35.50,00:05:36.00
MED-TECH: How are we today?

00:05:36.50,00:05:38.00
RIPLEY: Oh. Terrible.

00:05:38.50,00:05:40.00
MED-TECH:[br]Better than yesterday, at least.

00:05:40.50,00:05:42.00
Where am l?

00:05:42.50,00:05:43.00
MED-TECH: You´re safe.

00:05:43.50,00:05:46.00
You´re at Gateway Station.[br]Been here a couple of days.

00:05:46.50,00:05:50.00
You were pretty groggy at first,[br]but now you´re OK.

00:05:50.50,00:05:52.00
Looks like you´ve got a visitor.

00:05:52.50,00:05:54.00


00:05:54.50,00:05:57.00
Jonesy! Come here!

00:05:57.50,00:05:59.00
Hey, come here.

00:05:59.50,00:06:02.00
How are you, you stupid cat?

00:06:02.50,00:06:03.00
How are you?

00:06:03.50,00:06:05.00
Where have you been?

00:06:05.50,00:06:08.00
BURKE:[br]Guess you two have met, huh?

00:06:08.50,00:06:12.00
I´m Carter Burke.[br]I work for the Company.

00:06:12.50,00:06:15.00
Don´t let that fool you.[br]I´m really an OK guy.

00:06:15.50,00:06:16.00


00:06:16.50,00:06:18.00
I´m glad you´re feeling better.

00:06:18.50,00:06:22.00
They tell me the weakness and[br]disorientation should pass soon.

00:06:22.50,00:06:24.00
That´s just[br]natural side effects...

00:06:24.50,00:06:28.00
of such an unusually long[br]hypersleep.

00:06:28.50,00:06:30.00
What do you mean?

00:06:30.50,00:06:33.00
How long was I out there?

00:06:33.50,00:06:34.00


00:06:34.50,00:06:36.00
Has no one discussed this[br]with you?

00:06:36.50,00:06:38.00
No.

00:06:38.50,00:06:43.00
But, I mean,[br]I don´t recognize this place.

00:06:43.50,00:06:46.00
No, I know. Uh...OK.

00:06:46.50,00:06:49.00
This might be a shock.[br]It´s long--

00:06:49.50,00:06:51.00
How long?

00:06:51.50,00:06:53.00
Please.

00:06:53.50,00:06:55.00


00:06:55.50,00:06:56.00
Fifty-seven years.

00:06:56.50,00:06:57.00


00:06:57.50,00:06:59.00
What?

00:06:59.50,00:07:03.00
BURKE: You were out there[br]for fifty-seven years.

00:07:03.50,00:07:06.00
You drifted[br]right through the core systems.

00:07:06.50,00:07:09.00
It´s really just blind luck...

00:07:09.50,00:07:12.00
that a deep-salvage team[br]found you.

00:07:12.50,00:07:15.00
It´s one in a thousand, really.

00:07:15.50,00:07:17.00
You´re damn lucky[br]to be alive, kiddo.

00:07:17.50,00:07:19.00
You could be floating[br]out there forever.

00:07:19.50,00:07:21.00


00:07:21.50,00:07:22.00
You OK?

00:07:22.50,00:07:23.00


00:07:23.50,00:07:24.00
[Hiss]

00:07:24.50,00:07:25.00
Oh.

00:07:25.50,00:07:28.00
[Heartbeat]

00:07:28.50,00:07:29.00


00:07:29.50,00:07:32.00
-[Hiss][br]-Oh!

00:07:32.50,00:07:34.00
BURKE: You OK?

00:07:34.50,00:07:39.00


00:07:39.50,00:07:40.00
[Hiss]

00:07:40.50,00:07:42.00
Oh!

00:07:42.50,00:07:44.00
God!

00:07:44.50,00:07:45.00


00:07:45.50,00:07:47.00
BURKE: Nurse! Please!

00:07:47.50,00:07:49.00


00:07:49.50,00:07:51.00
Someone get in here now!

00:07:51.50,00:07:52.00
RIPLEY: No!

00:07:52.50,00:07:54.00
BURKE: Now!

00:07:54.50,00:07:56.00
-Hold--[br]-Please.

00:07:56.50,00:07:59.00
DOCTOR: Hold her.

00:07:59.50,00:08:01.00
Kill me!

00:08:01.50,00:08:09.00


00:08:09.50,00:08:10.00
No!

00:08:10.50,00:08:11.00
No!

00:08:11.50,00:08:18.00


00:08:18.50,00:08:20.00
MED-TECH: Bad dreams again?

00:08:20.50,00:08:21.00
You want something[br]to help you sleep?

00:08:21.50,00:08:23.00
No.

00:08:23.50,00:08:24.00


00:08:24.50,00:08:26.00
I´ve slept enough.

00:08:26.50,00:08:27.00


00:08:27.50,00:08:29.00
Jonesy.

00:08:29.50,00:08:30.00
Come here.

00:08:30.50,00:08:32.00
[Meow]

00:08:32.50,00:08:34.00
Shh.

00:08:34.50,00:08:38.00


00:08:38.50,00:08:39.00
It´s all right.

00:08:39.50,00:08:41.00


00:08:41.50,00:08:42.00
It´s all right now.

00:08:42.50,00:08:45.00


00:08:45.50,00:08:47.00
It´s over.

00:08:47.50,00:08:49.00


00:08:49.50,00:08:51.00
[Birds chirping]

00:08:51.50,00:09:06.00


00:09:06.50,00:09:08.00
[Chirping stops]

00:09:08.50,00:09:12.00


00:09:12.50,00:09:15.00
BURKE: Hi. Sorry l´m late.[br]Been running behind all morning.

00:09:15.50,00:09:17.00
RIPLEY: ls there[br]any word about my daughter?

00:09:17.50,00:09:18.00


00:09:18.50,00:09:22.00
Uh...l think we should[br]worry about the hearing now.

00:09:22.50,00:09:23.00
We don´t have a lot of time.

00:09:23.50,00:09:25.00
I read your deposition,[br]and it´s great.

00:09:25.50,00:09:27.00
If you stick to that,[br]we´ll be fine.

00:09:27.50,00:09:30.00
The thing is, there are gonna be[br]a lot of heavyweights in there.

00:09:30.50,00:09:32.00
Feds, lnterstellar[br]Commerce Commission...

00:09:32.50,00:09:35.00
Colonial Administration,[br]insurance company guys.

00:09:35.50,00:09:38.00
Do you have any news[br]about my daughter?

00:09:38.50,00:09:39.00


00:09:39.50,00:09:41.00
We did come up[br]with some information.

00:09:41.50,00:09:44.00
Why don´t we sit down?

00:09:44.50,00:09:47.00
I was hoping to wait[br]until after the inquest.

00:09:47.50,00:09:48.00
Uh...

00:09:48.50,00:09:51.00


00:09:51.50,00:09:53.00
´´Amanda Ripley McClaren--´´

00:09:53.50,00:09:55.00
married name, I guess--

00:09:55.50,00:09:57.00
´´age sixty-six.´´

00:09:57.50,00:10:00.00
That was at the time[br]of her death...

00:10:00.50,00:10:01.00


00:10:01.50,00:10:03.00
which was two years ago.

00:10:03.50,00:10:05.00


00:10:05.50,00:10:07.00
I´m real sorry.

00:10:07.50,00:10:17.00


00:10:17.50,00:10:18.00
Amy.

00:10:18.50,00:10:21.00


00:10:21.50,00:10:23.00
BURKE:[br]She was cremated and interred...

00:10:23.50,00:10:26.00
at Westlake Repository,[br]Little Chute, Wisconsin.

00:10:26.50,00:10:28.00
No children. I checked.

00:10:28.50,00:10:34.00


00:10:34.50,00:10:36.00
I promised her...

00:10:36.50,00:10:39.00
that I would be home[br]for her birthday.

00:10:39.50,00:10:42.00


00:10:42.50,00:10:44.00
Her eleventh birthday.

00:10:44.50,00:10:48.00


00:10:48.50,00:10:50.00
Ohh...

00:10:50.50,00:10:53.00
INVESTIGATOR: l´d like to[br]go back to this point...

00:10:53.50,00:10:55.00
about the override[br]destruct elements.

00:10:55.50,00:10:57.00
I don´t understand this.

00:10:57.50,00:11:00.00
We have been here[br]three and a half hours.

00:11:00.50,00:11:04.00
How many different ways[br]do you want the same story?

00:11:04.50,00:11:07.00
VAN LEUWEN: Look at it[br]from our perspective, please.

00:11:07.50,00:11:09.00


00:11:09.50,00:11:10.00
Please?

00:11:10.50,00:11:13.00


00:11:13.50,00:11:16.00
You freely admit to[br]detonating the engines of...

00:11:16.50,00:11:19.00
and thereby destroying[br]an M-Class star freighter...

00:11:19.50,00:11:21.00
a rather expensive piece[br]of hardware.

00:11:21.50,00:11:24.00
INVESTIGATOR: Forty-two million[br]in adjusted dollars.

00:11:24.50,00:11:27.00
That´s minus payload, of course.

00:11:27.50,00:11:29.00
VAN LEUWEN: The lifeboat´s[br]flight recorder...

00:11:29.50,00:11:32.00
corroborates some elements[br]of your account...

00:11:32.50,00:11:34.00
in that, for reasons unknown...

00:11:34.50,00:11:37.00
the Nostromo[br]set down on LV-426...

00:11:37.50,00:11:39.00
an unsurveyed planet[br]at that time...

00:11:39.50,00:11:41.00
that it resumed its course...

00:11:41.50,00:11:45.00
and was subsequently set[br]for self-destruct by you...

00:11:45.50,00:11:46.00
for reasons unknown.

00:11:46.50,00:11:48.00
Not for reasons unknown.

00:11:48.50,00:11:49.00
I told you.

00:11:49.50,00:11:52.00
We set down on Company orders[br]to get this thing...

00:11:52.50,00:11:57.00
which destroyed my crew[br]and your expensive ship.

00:11:57.50,00:11:59.00
The analysis team...

00:11:59.50,00:12:01.00
which went over the lifeboat[br]centimeter by centimeter...

00:12:01.50,00:12:04.00
found no physical evidence[br]of the creature you describe.

00:12:04.50,00:12:08.00
Good! That´s because I blew it[br]out of the goddamn air lock.

00:12:08.50,00:12:10.00


00:12:10.50,00:12:11.00
Like I said.

00:12:11.50,00:12:14.00


00:12:14.50,00:12:15.00
INVESTIGATOR:[br]Are there any species...

00:12:15.50,00:12:18.00
Iike this hostile organism[br]on LV-426?

00:12:18.50,00:12:21.00
ECA REP: No. It´s a rock.[br]No indigenous life.

00:12:21.50,00:12:23.00


00:12:23.50,00:12:26.00
Did IQs just drop sharply[br]while I was away?

00:12:26.50,00:12:29.00
Ma´am, I already said[br]it was not indigenous.

00:12:29.50,00:12:32.00
It was a derelict spacecraft.[br]It was an alien ship.

00:12:32.50,00:12:34.00
It was not from there.

00:12:34.50,00:12:37.00
Do you get it?[br]We homed in on its beacon.

00:12:37.50,00:12:40.00
And found something[br]never recorded once...

00:12:40.50,00:12:43.00
in over three hundred[br]surveyed worlds.

00:12:43.50,00:12:48.00
´´A creature that gestates[br]inside a living human host.´´

00:12:48.50,00:12:50.00
These are your words.

00:12:50.50,00:12:52.00
´´And has concentrated acid[br]for blood.´´

00:12:52.50,00:12:53.00
RIPLEY: That´s right.

00:12:53.50,00:12:54.00


00:12:54.50,00:12:58.00
Look.[br]I can see where this is going...

00:12:58.50,00:13:01.00
but l´m telling you[br]that those things exist.

00:13:01.50,00:13:03.00
Thank you, Officer Ripley.[br]That will be all.

00:13:03.50,00:13:04.00
Please! You´re not listening.

00:13:04.50,00:13:06.00
Kane--the crew member...

00:13:06.50,00:13:11.00
Kane, who went into that ship,[br]said he saw thousands of eggs.

00:13:11.50,00:13:13.00
Thank you. That will be all.

00:13:13.50,00:13:15.00
God damn it, that´s not all!

00:13:15.50,00:13:18.00
If one of those things gets[br]down here, that will be all!

00:13:18.50,00:13:21.00
And all this bullshit[br]you think is important...

00:13:21.50,00:13:23.00
you can kiss all that good-bye!

00:13:23.50,00:13:30.00


00:13:30.50,00:13:33.00
It is the finding[br]of this court of inquiry...

00:13:33.50,00:13:35.00
that Warrant Officer[br]E. Ripley...

00:13:35.50,00:13:38.00
N-O-C-one-four-four-seven-two...

00:13:38.50,00:13:41.00
has acted[br]with questionable judgment...

00:13:41.50,00:13:44.00
and is unfit[br]to hold an ICC license...

00:13:44.50,00:13:45.00


00:13:45.50,00:13:47.00
as a commercial flight officer.

00:13:47.50,00:13:51.00
Said license is hereby[br]suspended indefinitely.

00:13:51.50,00:13:52.00


00:13:52.50,00:13:54.00
No criminal charges...

00:13:54.50,00:13:57.00
will be filed against you[br]at this time...

00:13:57.50,00:14:00.00
and you are released[br]on your own recognizance...

00:14:00.50,00:14:02.00
for a six-month period[br]of psychometric probation...

00:14:02.50,00:14:08.00
to include monthly review by[br]an ICC psychiatric technician.

00:14:25.50,00:14:26.00


00:14:26.50,00:14:27.00
Look, I think--Ripley.

00:14:27.50,00:14:29.00
RIPLEY: Van Leuwen.

00:14:29.50,00:14:32.00
Why don´t you just[br]check out LV-426?

00:14:32.50,00:14:34.00
VAN LEUWEN:[br]Because I don´t have to.

00:14:34.50,00:14:37.00
People have been there[br]for over twenty years...

00:14:37.50,00:14:39.00
and they never complained[br]about any hostile organism.

00:14:39.50,00:14:41.00
RIPLEY: What people?

00:14:41.50,00:14:43.00
VAN LEUWEN: Terraformers.

00:14:43.50,00:14:44.00
Planet engineers.

00:14:44.50,00:14:47.00
They go in,[br]set up atmosphere processors...

00:14:47.50,00:14:48.00
to make the air breathable.

00:14:48.50,00:14:50.00
It takes decades.

00:14:50.50,00:14:53.00
It´s what we call[br]a shake ´n´ bake colony.

00:14:53.50,00:14:57.00
How many are there?[br]How many colonists?

00:14:57.50,00:15:00.00
I don´t know.[br]Sixty, maybe seventy families.

00:15:00.50,00:15:01.00
Do you mind?

00:15:01.50,00:15:04.00


00:15:04.50,00:15:05.00

00:16:27.50,00:16:29.00
-Al?[br]-What?

00:16:29.50,00:16:31.00
-Hey, Al.[br]-What?

00:16:31.50,00:16:33.00
LYDECKER: Remember you sent[br]some wildcatters...

00:16:33.50,00:16:34.00
out in the middle of nowhere[br]last week...

00:16:34.50,00:16:36.00
out past the llium Range?

00:16:36.50,00:16:39.00
One´s on the horn,[br]a mom-and-pop survey team.

00:16:39.50,00:16:42.00
He´s onto something,[br]wants his claim honored.

00:16:42.50,00:16:44.00
AL:[br]Why wouldn´t it be honored?

00:16:44.50,00:16:48.00
LYDECKER: Because you sent them[br]on Company orders maybe?

00:16:48.50,00:16:51.00
AL: Christ. Some haunch in[br]a cushy office on Earth says...

00:16:51.50,00:16:53.00
´´Go look at a grid reference.´´

00:16:53.50,00:16:56.00
We look. They don´t say why,[br]and I don´t ask...

00:16:56.50,00:17:00.00
because it takes two weeks[br]to get an answer out here.

00:17:00.50,00:17:02.00
The answer is always,[br]´´Don´t ask.´´

00:17:02.50,00:17:04.00
LYDECKER:[br]What do I tell this guy?

00:17:04.50,00:17:08.00
AL: As far as l´m concerned,[br]if he finds something, it´s his.

00:17:08.50,00:17:10.00
-Lydecker?[br]-What?

00:17:10.50,00:17:11.00


00:17:11.50,00:17:13.00
LYDECKER: You kids know[br]you´re not supposed to be here!

00:17:13.50,00:17:14.00
Get out!

00:17:14.50,00:17:47.00


00:17:47.50,00:17:49.00
TIMMY:[br]You go in places we can´t fit.

00:17:49.50,00:17:52.00
NEWT:[br]So? That´s why l´m the best!

00:17:52.50,00:17:54.00
MOTHER: Knock it off.

00:17:54.50,00:17:57.00
If I catch you playing in the[br]air ducts, l´ll tan your hides.

00:17:57.50,00:17:59.00

00:18:02.50,00:18:12.00


00:18:12.50,00:18:15.00
Folks,[br]we have scored big this time.

00:18:15.50,00:18:22.00


00:18:22.50,00:18:23.00
What is it, Dad?

00:18:23.50,00:18:28.00


00:18:28.50,00:18:29.00
I´m not sure.

00:18:29.50,00:18:31.00


00:18:31.50,00:18:33.00
Let´s see if we can´t get[br]a closer look at this thing...

00:18:33.50,00:18:35.00
maybe through that crack[br]on the side.

00:18:35.50,00:18:37.00
MOTHER: Shouldn´t we call in?

00:18:37.50,00:18:39.00
Let´s wait till we know[br]what to call it in as.

00:18:39.50,00:18:43.00


00:18:43.50,00:18:45.00
That´s about as close[br]as we can get.

00:18:45.50,00:18:46.00


00:18:46.50,00:18:48.00
Should we look inside?

BURKE: Hiya, Ripley.

00:21:29.50,00:21:32.00
This is Lieutenant Gorman[br]of the Colonial Marine Corps--

00:21:32.50,00:21:33.00


00:21:33.50,00:21:35.00
Ripley, we have to talk.

00:21:35.50,00:21:39.00
We´ve lost contact[br]with the colony on LV-426.

00:21:39.50,00:21:46.00


00:21:46.50,00:21:48.00
I don´t believe this.

00:21:48.50,00:21:50.00
You guys throw me[br]to the wolves...

00:21:50.50,00:21:53.00
and now you want me[br]to go back there?

00:21:53.50,00:21:55.00
Forget it.[br]It´s not my problem.

00:21:55.50,00:21:56.00


00:21:56.50,00:21:57.00
-Can I finish?[br]-No.

00:21:57.50,00:21:59.00
There´s no way.

00:21:59.50,00:22:00.00


00:22:00.50,00:22:02.00
GORMAN: You wouldn´t be[br]going in with the troops.

00:22:02.50,00:22:05.00
I can guarantee your safety.

00:22:05.50,00:22:08.00
BURKE: These Colonial Marines[br]are very tough hombres.

00:22:08.50,00:22:11.00
They´re packing[br]state-of-the-art firepower.

00:22:11.50,00:22:13.00
There´s nothing[br]they can´t handle.

00:22:13.50,00:22:14.00
Lieutenant, am I right?

00:22:14.50,00:22:18.00
We´ve been trained to deal[br]with situations like this.

00:22:18.50,00:22:21.00
Then you don´t need me.[br]I´m not a soldier.

00:22:21.50,00:22:24.00
BURKE: But we don´t know[br]exactly what´s going on.

00:22:24.50,00:22:26.00
It may be a downed transmitter.

00:22:26.50,00:22:28.00
But if it´s not...

00:22:28.50,00:22:32.00
I´d like you there[br]as an advisor, and that´s all.

00:22:32.50,00:22:35.00


00:22:35.50,00:22:38.00
What´s your interest[br]in all this? Why are you going?

00:22:38.50,00:22:39.00


00:22:39.50,00:22:42.00
The Corporation co-financed[br]that colony...

00:22:42.50,00:22:44.00
along with[br]Colonial Administration.

00:22:44.50,00:22:46.00
We´re getting into a lot[br]of terraforming now...

00:22:46.50,00:22:47.00
and building better worlds--

00:22:47.50,00:22:50.00
RIPLEY:[br]Yeah. I saw the commercial.

00:22:50.50,00:22:53.00
I don´t have time for this.[br]I´ve got to get to work.

00:22:53.50,00:22:56.00
Right. I heard you´re[br]working the cargo docks.

00:22:56.50,00:22:58.00
That´s right.

00:22:58.50,00:22:59.00
Running loaders and forklifts.

00:22:59.50,00:23:01.00
Yeah. So?

00:23:01.50,00:23:04.00
Nothing. I think it´s great[br]that you´re keeping busy.

00:23:04.50,00:23:07.00
I know it´s the only thing[br]you could get.

00:23:07.50,00:23:09.00
There´s nothing wrong with it.

00:23:09.50,00:23:11.00


00:23:11.50,00:23:13.00
What would you say[br]if I told you...

00:23:13.50,00:23:16.00
I could get you reinstated[br]as a flight officer?

00:23:16.50,00:23:18.00
The Company´s already agreed[br]to pick up your contract.

00:23:18.50,00:23:19.00


00:23:19.50,00:23:21.00
If I go.

00:23:21.50,00:23:22.00


00:23:22.50,00:23:24.00
Yeah, if you go.

00:23:24.50,00:23:26.00
Come on.[br]That´s a second chance, kiddo.

00:23:26.50,00:23:28.00
I think personally for you...

00:23:28.50,00:23:31.00
it would be the best thing[br]to go and face this thing.

00:23:31.50,00:23:32.00
Get back on the horse.

00:23:32.50,00:23:35.00
Spare me.[br]I´ve had my psych evaluation.

00:23:35.50,00:23:37.00
I know. I´ve read it.

00:23:37.50,00:23:39.00
You wake up every night,[br]soaked in sweat--

00:23:39.50,00:23:41.00
I said no, and I mean it!

00:23:41.50,00:23:44.00


00:23:44.50,00:23:46.00
Now please leave.

00:23:46.50,00:23:47.00
I am not going back...

00:23:47.50,00:23:51.00
and I would not be[br]any good to you if I did.

00:23:51.50,00:23:52.00
OK.

00:23:52.50,00:23:53.00
Shh.

00:23:53.50,00:23:55.00


00:23:55.50,00:23:58.00
Would you do me a favor?[br]Just think about it.

RIPLEY:[br]Just tell me one thing, Burke.

00:25:20.50,00:25:23.00
You´re going out there[br]to destroy them, right?

00:25:23.50,00:25:25.00
Not to study.

00:25:25.50,00:25:27.00
Not to bring back.

00:25:27.50,00:25:29.00
But to wipe them out.

00:25:29.50,00:25:33.00
That´s the plan.[br]You have my word on it.

00:25:33.50,00:25:35.00

00:29:00.50,00:29:01.00


00:29:01.50,00:29:03.00
APONE:[br]Want me to fetch your slippers?

00:29:03.50,00:29:05.00
Gee, would you, sir?[br]l´d like that.

00:29:05.50,00:29:06.00
Look into my eye.

00:29:06.50,00:29:08.00
Fall in, people!

00:29:08.50,00:29:10.00
Come on, let´s go.

00:29:10.50,00:29:12.00
FROST: I hate this job.

00:29:12.50,00:29:15.00
APONE: Crowe, Wierzbowski,[br]on your feet.

00:29:15.50,00:29:18.00


00:29:18.50,00:29:20.00
FROST: l´m talking about[br]breathing, not this frozen shit.

00:29:20.50,00:29:21.00


00:29:21.50,00:29:22.00
DIETRICH:[br]Yeah, Top, how about it?

00:29:22.50,00:29:26.00


00:29:26.50,00:29:29.00
APONE: First assembly´s[br]in fifteen, people. Shag it.

00:29:29.50,00:29:31.00


00:29:31.50,00:29:34.00
VASQUEZ: Hey, mira.[br]Who´s Snow White?

00:29:34.50,00:29:37.00
FERRO: She´s supposed to be[br]some kind of consultant.

00:29:37.50,00:29:38.00


00:29:38.50,00:29:40.00
Apparently,[br]she saw an alien once.

00:29:40.50,00:29:42.00
HUDSON: Whoopee-fucking-do!

00:29:42.50,00:29:43.00
Hey, l´m impressed.

00:29:43.50,00:29:45.00
VASQUEZ: Qué bonita.

00:29:45.50,00:29:47.00


00:29:47.50,00:29:49.00
HUDSON: Hey, Vasquez.

00:29:49.50,00:29:52.00
Have you ever been[br]mistaken for a man?

00:29:52.50,00:29:54.00
No. Have you?

00:29:54.50,00:29:56.00
DRAKE: Ha ha! Oh, Vasquez.

00:29:56.50,00:29:57.00


00:29:57.50,00:29:59.00
You´re just too bad.

00:29:59.50,00:30:09.00


00:30:09.50,00:30:12.00
HUDSON: Hey, Top, what´s the op?

00:30:12.50,00:30:14.00
APONE: A rescue mission.[br]You´ll love it.

00:30:14.50,00:30:16.00
There´s some juicy[br]colonists´ daughters...

00:30:16.50,00:30:18.00
we have to rescue[br]from their virginity.

00:30:18.50,00:30:19.00


00:30:19.50,00:30:21.00
SPUNKMEYER: Dumbass colonists.

00:30:21.50,00:30:24.00


00:30:24.50,00:30:27.00
SPUNKMEYER:[br]What´s this crap supposed to be?

00:30:27.50,00:30:29.00
FROST: Cornbread, I think.

00:30:29.50,00:30:31.00
HICKS:[br]lt´s good for you, boy. Eat it.

00:30:31.50,00:30:34.00
FROST: I wouldn´t mind getting[br]more of that Arcturian poontang.

00:30:34.50,00:30:35.00


00:30:35.50,00:30:36.00
Remember that time?

00:30:36.50,00:30:39.00
SPUNKMEYER: Yeah, but the one[br]you had was a male.

00:30:39.50,00:30:42.00
FROST: It doesn´t matter[br]when it´s Arcturian.

00:30:42.50,00:30:44.00
HUDSON: Hey, Bishop,[br]do the thing with the knife.

00:30:44.50,00:30:46.00
BISHOP: Oh, please.

00:30:46.50,00:30:49.00
HUDSON: Come on. All right!

00:30:49.50,00:30:51.00
APONE: I don´t want to see that.

00:30:51.50,00:30:53.00
HUDSON: All right!

00:30:53.50,00:30:56.00
What are you doing, man?

00:30:56.50,00:30:58.00
Quit messing around, Drake.

00:30:58.50,00:31:00.00
Bishop. Hey, man.

00:31:00.50,00:31:02.00
-Do it.[br]-Hey, not me, man!

00:31:02.50,00:31:04.00
DRAKE: Yeah, you. Don´t move.

00:31:04.50,00:31:06.00
Trust me.

00:31:06.50,00:31:08.00


00:31:08.50,00:31:19.00
Aah!

00:31:19.50,00:31:21.00
APONE: All right, knock it off.

00:31:21.50,00:31:23.00
Thank you.

00:31:23.50,00:31:24.00


00:31:24.50,00:31:26.00
[Laughter]

00:31:26.50,00:31:28.00
DRAKE: Enjoy your meal.

00:31:28.50,00:31:30.00
That wasn´t funny, man.

00:31:30.50,00:31:34.00


00:31:34.50,00:31:36.00
BISHOP:[br]Lieutenant Gorman? Mr. Burke?

00:31:36.50,00:31:37.00
BURKE: Yeah, thanks.

00:31:37.50,00:31:42.00
Looks like the new lieutenant´s[br]too good to eat with us grunts.

00:31:42.50,00:31:44.00


00:31:44.50,00:31:47.00
FROST: Boy´s definitely[br]got a corncob up his ass.

00:31:47.50,00:31:48.00


00:31:48.50,00:31:51.00
BURKE: I thought you[br]never missed, Bishop.

00:31:51.50,00:31:54.00


00:31:54.50,00:31:57.00
You never said anything about[br]an android being on board.

00:31:57.50,00:31:58.00


00:31:58.50,00:32:01.00
It never occurred to me.

00:32:01.50,00:32:04.00
It´s common practice[br]to have a synthetic on board.

00:32:04.50,00:32:07.00
I prefer the term[br]´´artificial person.´´

00:32:07.50,00:32:09.00
Right.

00:32:09.50,00:32:10.00
Is there a problem?

00:32:10.50,00:32:11.00


00:32:11.50,00:32:14.00
BURKE: l´m sorry. I don´t know[br]why I didn´t even...

00:32:14.50,00:32:15.00
Ripley´s last trip, the syn--

00:32:15.50,00:32:17.00
the artificial person[br]malfunctioned.

00:32:17.50,00:32:18.00
Malfunctioned?

00:32:18.50,00:32:22.00
There were problems,[br]and a few deaths were involved.

00:32:22.50,00:32:23.00
I´m shocked.

00:32:23.50,00:32:24.00


00:32:24.50,00:32:25.00
Was it an older model?

00:32:25.50,00:32:27.00
Yeah.[br]The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A-2.

00:32:27.50,00:32:28.00


00:32:28.50,00:32:31.00
That explains it. The A-2s[br]always were a bit twitchy.

00:32:31.50,00:32:34.00
That could never happen now[br]with our behavioral inhibitors.

00:32:34.50,00:32:35.00
It is impossible for me[br]to harm...

00:32:35.50,00:32:38.00
or allow to be harmed[br]a human being.

00:32:38.50,00:32:40.00
Sure you don´t want some?

00:32:40.50,00:32:41.00


00:32:41.50,00:32:43.00
[Crash]

00:32:43.50,00:32:45.00
Just stay away from me.[br]You got that straight?

00:32:45.50,00:32:48.00


00:32:48.50,00:32:50.00
FROST: Guess she don´t like[br]the cornbread, either.

00:32:50.50,00:33:05.00


00:33:05.50,00:33:07.00
APONE: Squad, ten-hut![br]Officer on deck!

00:33:07.50,00:33:09.00
GORMAN: As you were.

00:33:09.50,00:33:10.00
APONE: Quickly, quickly.

00:33:10.50,00:33:12.00
Settle down.

00:33:12.50,00:33:13.00
All right, listen up!

00:33:13.50,00:33:14.00


00:33:14.50,00:33:16.00
GORMAN: Good morning, Marines.

00:33:16.50,00:33:20.00
I´m sorry we didn´t have time[br]to brief you before we left--

00:33:20.50,00:33:21.00
HUDSON: Sir!

00:33:21.50,00:33:23.00
What is it, Hicks?

00:33:23.50,00:33:24.00
HUDSON: Hudson, sir.

00:33:24.50,00:33:26.00
He´s Hicks.

00:33:26.50,00:33:27.00


00:33:27.50,00:33:29.00
What´s the question?

00:33:29.50,00:33:33.00
Is this gonna be a stand-up[br]fight or another bug-hunt?

00:33:33.50,00:33:37.00
All we know is there´s still[br]no contact with the colony...

00:33:37.50,00:33:39.00
and a xenomorph may be involved.

00:33:39.50,00:33:41.00
APONE: Excuse me, sir. A what?

00:33:41.50,00:33:43.00
GORMAN: A xenomorph.

00:33:43.50,00:33:44.00
HICKS: lt´s a bug-hunt.

00:33:44.50,00:33:45.00


00:33:45.50,00:33:47.00
What exactly[br]are we dealing with?

00:33:47.50,00:33:48.00
GORMAN: Ripley.

00:33:48.50,00:33:50.00


00:33:50.50,00:33:51.00
RIPLEY:[br]l´ll tell you what I know.

00:33:51.50,00:33:52.00


00:33:52.50,00:33:55.00
We set down on LV-426.

00:33:55.50,00:33:57.00
A crew member[br]was brought back on board...

00:33:57.50,00:33:59.00
with something attached[br]to his face...

00:33:59.50,00:34:01.00
some kind of parasite.

00:34:01.50,00:34:04.00
We tried to get it off.[br]It wouldn´t come off.

00:34:04.50,00:34:07.00
Later, it seemed to come off[br]by itself and die.

00:34:07.50,00:34:09.00
Kane seemed fine.

00:34:09.50,00:34:12.00
We were all having dinner.

00:34:12.50,00:34:14.00
It must have laid[br]something inside his throat...

00:34:14.50,00:34:16.00
some sort of embryo.

00:34:16.50,00:34:19.00
He started...Um, he--

00:34:19.50,00:34:23.00
VASQUEZ: Look, man,[br]I only need to know one thing--

00:34:23.50,00:34:25.00
where they are.

00:34:25.50,00:34:26.00
DRAKE: Vasquez, kick ass.

00:34:26.50,00:34:28.00
VASQUEZ: Anytime, anywhere.

00:34:28.50,00:34:30.00
HUDSON:[br]Right. Somebody said ´´alien...´´

00:34:30.50,00:34:33.00
she thought they said[br]´´illegal alien´´ and signed up.

00:34:33.50,00:34:35.00
-Fuck you, man.[br]-Anytime, anywhere.

00:34:35.50,00:34:37.00
RIPLEY: Are you finished?

00:34:37.50,00:34:42.00


00:34:42.50,00:34:46.00
I hope you´re right.[br]I really do.

00:34:46.50,00:34:48.00


00:34:48.50,00:34:50.00
GORMAN: Yeah, OK. Right.[br]Thank you, Ripley.

00:34:50.50,00:34:54.00
We have Ripley´s report on disk.[br]I suggest you study it.

00:34:54.50,00:34:55.00
RIPLEY: Because just one[br]of those things...

00:34:55.50,00:34:59.00
wiped out my crew[br]in less than twenty-four hours.

00:34:59.50,00:35:01.00
If the colonists[br]have found that ship...

00:35:01.50,00:35:03.00
there´s no telling how many[br]have been exposed.

00:35:03.50,00:35:04.00
Do you understand?

00:35:04.50,00:35:08.00


00:35:08.50,00:35:11.00
GORMAN: Anyway, we have it[br]on disk, so look at it.

00:35:11.50,00:35:13.00
Any questions?

00:35:13.50,00:35:14.00


00:35:14.50,00:35:16.00
What is it, Private?

00:35:16.50,00:35:19.00
How do I get out[br]of this chickenshit outfit?

00:35:19.50,00:35:21.00
You secure that shit, Hudson.

00:35:21.50,00:35:23.00


00:35:23.50,00:35:25.00
All right.

00:35:25.50,00:35:26.00


00:35:26.50,00:35:28.00
Now listen up.

00:35:28.50,00:35:30.00


00:35:30.50,00:35:34.00
I want this thing to go smooth[br]and by the numbers.

00:35:34.50,00:35:35.00


00:35:35.50,00:35:39.00
I want DCS and tactical database[br]assimilation by 0830.

00:35:39.50,00:35:41.00
Ordnance loading,[br]weapons strip...

00:35:41.50,00:35:44.00
and drop-ship prep details[br]will have seven hours.

00:35:44.50,00:35:45.00


00:35:45.50,00:35:46.00
Now move it, people!

00:35:46.50,00:35:47.00


00:35:47.50,00:35:50.00
You heard the man,[br]and you know the drill.

00:35:50.50,00:35:52.00
Assholes and elbows!

00:35:52.50,00:35:54.00
Hudson, come here.[br]Come here!

00:35:54.50,00:36:09.00


00:36:09.50,00:36:12.00
APONE: I don´t care if you are[br]short, Hudson. Get it done.

00:36:12.50,00:36:14.00
HUDSON: You´ll get lip cancer[br]smoking those.

00:36:14.50,00:36:18.00
APONE: I want this loading lock[br]sealed. Now!

00:36:18.50,00:36:20.00
-How many more, Spunkmeyer?[br]-Last one.

00:36:20.50,00:36:21.00
Good. Take it away.

00:36:21.50,00:36:39.00


00:36:39.50,00:36:41.00
SPUNKMEYER: Clear behind.

00:36:41.50,00:36:48.00


00:36:48.50,00:36:50.00
APONE:[br]Did you check number three?

00:36:50.50,00:36:54.00
Hi. I feel like a fifth wheel.[br]Is there anything I can do?

00:36:54.50,00:36:57.00
I don´t know.[br]Is there anything you can do?

00:36:57.50,00:37:00.00


00:37:00.50,00:37:02.00
Well, I can drive that loader.

00:37:02.50,00:37:05.00
I have a Class Two rating.

00:37:05.50,00:37:07.00


00:37:07.50,00:37:08.00
Be my guest.

00:37:08.50,00:37:53.00


00:37:53.50,00:37:55.00
Where you want it?

00:37:55.50,00:37:59.00


00:37:59.50,00:38:01.00
Bay twelve, please.

00:38:01.50,00:38:57.00


00:38:57.50,00:39:01.00
APONE: We´re a team, and there´s[br]nothing to worry about.

00:39:01.50,00:39:03.00
We come here,[br]and we gonna conquer...

00:39:03.50,00:39:06.00
and we gonna take some.[br]Is that understood?

00:39:06.50,00:39:09.00
That´s what we gonna do.[br]We are going to get some.

00:39:09.50,00:39:12.00

00:43:14.50,00:43:16.00
Drake, check your camera.

00:43:16.50,00:43:18.00
There seems to be a malfunction.

00:43:18.50,00:43:19.00
That´s better.

00:43:19.50,00:43:22.00

00:45:18.50,00:45:26.00

APONE: Sir, you copying this?

00:48:37.50,00:48:40.00
Looks like hits[br]from small-arms fire.

00:48:40.50,00:48:45.00
We got some explosives damages,[br]probably seismic survey charges.

00:48:45.50,00:48:47.00

00:52:05.50,00:52:07.00
Let´s go check their computer.

00:52:07.50,00:52:10.00
-It´s not secure.[br]-The area´s secured.

00:52:10.50,00:52:13.00
GORMAN:[br]First team, head for Operations.

00:52:13.50,00:52:15.00
Hudson, get their CPU on-line.

00:52:15.50,00:52:16.00
HUDSON: Affirmative.

00:52:16.50,00:52:18.00
Hicks,[br]meet me at the south lock.

00:52:18.50,00:52:19.00
We´re coming in.

00:52:19.50,00:52:21.00
HUDSON: He´s coming in.

00:52:21.50,00:52:23.00
I feel safer already.

00:52:23.50,00:52:26.00
VASQUEZ: Pendejo jerkoff.

00:52:26.50,00:52:45.00


00:52:45.50,00:52:49.00
HUDSON: Sir, we got[br]the CPU on-line. No problem.

00:52:49.50,00:52:51.00
GORMAN:[br]Good. Stand by in Operations.

00:52:51.50,00:52:53.00


00:52:53.50,00:52:55.00
OK, let´s go.

00:52:55.50,00:53:15.00


00:53:15.50,00:53:17.00
Are you all right?

00:53:17.50,00:53:18.00


00:53:18.50,00:53:20.00
Yes.

00:53:20.50,00:53:36.00


00:53:36.50,00:53:37.00
DRAKE: Sir...

00:53:37.50,00:53:38.00


00:53:38.50,00:53:41.00
they sealed off this wing at[br]both ends, welded the doors...

00:53:41.50,00:53:44.00
and blocked off the stairs[br]with heavy equipment.

00:53:44.50,00:53:47.00
But it looks like[br]the barricade didn´t hold.

00:53:47.50,00:53:50.00
-Any bodies?[br]-No, sir.

00:53:50.50,00:53:52.00
FROST: Last stand.

00:53:52.50,00:53:53.00
DRAKE: Must have been[br]a hell of a fight.

00:53:53.50,00:53:54.00


00:53:54.50,00:53:56.00
HICKS: Looks that way.

00:53:56.50,00:53:58.00


00:53:58.50,00:54:01.00
GORMAN:[br]All right, Drake, this way.

00:54:01.50,00:54:04.00
We should be able to cut through[br]the med lab to Operations.

00:54:04.50,00:54:56.00


00:54:56.50,00:54:57.00
HICKS: Lieutenant.

Gorman.

00:55:18.50,00:55:20.00
Are those the same ones?

00:55:20.50,00:55:34.00


00:55:34.50,00:55:35.00
Careful, Burke.

00:55:35.50,00:55:45.00


00:55:45.50,00:55:48.00
HICKS: Looks like[br]love at first sight to me.

00:55:48.50,00:55:49.00


00:55:49.50,00:55:51.00
Oh, he likes you, Burke.

00:55:51.50,00:55:54.00
BISHOP: Two are alive.[br]The rest are dead.

They killed him taking it off.

[Beeping]

00:56:09.50,00:56:10.00
FROST: Yo, Hicks.

00:56:10.50,00:56:11.00


00:56:11.50,00:56:13.00
I think we got something here.

00:56:13.50,00:56:18.00


00:56:18.50,00:56:19.00
HICKS: Behind us.

RIPLEY: One of us?

00:56:21.50,00:56:23.00
GORMAN:[br]Apone, where are your people?

00:56:23.50,00:56:25.00
Anybody in D-Block?

00:56:25.50,00:56:27.00
APONE: Negative.[br]We´re all in Operations.

00:56:27.50,00:56:31.00


00:56:31.50,00:56:33.00
DRAKE: Talk to me, Frosty.

00:56:33.50,00:56:35.00
FROST: Let´s keep moving, baby.

00:56:54.50,00:56:55.00
DRAKE: Which way?

00:56:55.50,00:56:57.00
FROST:[br]lt´s coming straight for us.

Straight up.

It´s all right.

RIPLEY: Don´t be afraid.[br]Come on. We won´t hurt you.

00:58:10.50,00:58:12.00
Shh. It´s all right. It´s OK.

GORMAN:[br]Frost, get your light up here.

00:58:23.50,00:58:25.00
RIPLEY: Where´d she go?

00:58:25.50,00:58:26.00


00:58:26.50,00:58:28.00
FROST: She´s on the other side.

00:58:28.50,00:58:30.00
RIPLEY: Shine the light!

Wait. No, you don´t.

00:59:25.50,00:59:27.00
It´s OK.

00:59:27.50,00:59:29.00
You´re gonna be all right now.

00:59:29.50,00:59:30.00
Shh.

00:59:30.50,00:59:35.00
Easy. Easy.[br]It´s gonna be OK.

00:59:35.50,00:59:37.00
It´s all right.[br]You´re gonna be OK.

00:59:37.50,00:59:39.00
Shh, shh, shh.

00:59:39.50,00:59:42.00
Easy. Easy.

01:00:20.50,01:00:22.00
DIETRICH: Rebecca.

01:00:22.50,01:00:25.00
GORMAN: Now think, Rebecca.[br]Concentrate.

01:00:25.50,01:00:26.00


01:00:26.50,01:00:28.00
Just start at the beginning.

01:00:28.50,01:00:30.00
Where are your parents?

01:00:30.50,01:00:31.00


01:00:31.50,01:00:32.00
Look, Rebecca, you have to try--

01:00:32.50,01:00:33.00


01:00:33.50,01:00:36.00
Gorman, give it a rest,[br]why don´t you?

01:00:36.50,01:00:39.00


01:00:39.50,01:00:41.00
GORMAN: Total brainlock.

01:00:41.50,01:00:43.00
DIETRICH: Physically, she´s OK.

01:00:43.50,01:00:47.00
Borderline malnutrition,[br]but no permanent damage.

01:00:47.50,01:00:49.00
GORMAN:[br]Come on. We´re wasting time.

01:00:49.50,01:00:58.00


01:00:58.50,01:01:00.00
RIPLEY: Try this.

01:01:00.50,01:01:01.00


01:01:01.50,01:01:03.00
It´s a little hot chocolate.

01:01:03.50,01:01:05.00


01:01:05.50,01:01:06.00
There you go.

01:01:06.50,01:01:07.00


01:01:07.50,01:01:08.00
Whoop.

01:01:08.50,01:01:10.00


01:01:10.50,01:01:11.00
That good, huh?

01:01:11.50,01:01:16.00


01:01:16.50,01:01:17.00
Uh-oh.

01:01:17.50,01:01:20.00
I made a clean spot here.

01:01:20.50,01:01:21.00
Now l´ve done it.

01:01:21.50,01:01:23.00
Guess l´ll have to do[br]the whole thing.

01:01:23.50,01:01:33.00


01:01:33.50,01:01:36.00
Hard to believe there´s[br]a little girl under all this.

01:01:36.50,01:01:38.00


01:01:38.50,01:01:40.00
And a pretty one, too.

01:01:40.50,01:01:46.00


01:01:46.50,01:01:47.00
You don´t talk much, do you?

01:01:47.50,01:01:56.00


01:01:56.50,01:01:58.00
HUDSON: Smoking or non-smoking?

01:01:58.50,01:02:00.00
GORMAN: Tell me what[br]you´re scanning for.

01:02:00.50,01:02:02.00
BURKE: PDTs.

01:02:02.50,01:02:04.00
Personal data transmitters.

Every colonist had one[br]surgically implanted.

If they´re within twenty klicks,[br]we´ll read it out here.

01:02:10.50,01:02:12.00
So far, zippo.

01:02:12.50,01:02:15.00
I don´t know how you[br]stayed alive...

01:02:15.50,01:02:18.00
but you´re one brave kid,[br]Rebecca.

01:02:18.50,01:02:20.00


01:02:20.50,01:02:22.00
Newt.

01:02:22.50,01:02:23.00


01:02:23.50,01:02:25.00
What´d you say?

01:02:25.50,01:02:27.00
Newt.

01:02:27.50,01:02:29.00
My name´s Newt.

01:02:29.50,01:02:34.00
Nobody calls me Rebecca[br]except my brother.

01:02:34.50,01:02:36.00
Newt.

01:02:36.50,01:02:38.00
I like that.

01:02:38.50,01:02:40.00
I´m Ripley.

01:02:40.50,01:02:43.00
It´s nice to meet you.

01:02:43.50,01:02:45.00


01:02:45.50,01:02:48.00
And who is this, hmm?

01:02:48.50,01:02:50.00
Casey.

01:02:50.50,01:02:52.00
Hello, Casey.

01:02:52.50,01:02:55.00
What about your brother?[br]What´s his name?

01:02:55.50,01:02:56.00
Timmy.

01:02:56.50,01:02:59.00
RIPLEY:[br]ls Timmy around here, too?

01:02:59.50,01:03:01.00
Maybe hiding like you were?

01:03:01.50,01:03:05.00


01:03:05.50,01:03:06.00
Any sisters?

01:03:06.50,01:03:10.00


01:03:10.50,01:03:12.00
Mom and Dad?

01:03:12.50,01:03:14.00


01:03:14.50,01:03:18.00
Newt, look at me.

01:03:18.50,01:03:19.00
Where are they?

01:03:19.50,01:03:22.00
They´re dead, all right?[br]Can I go now?

01:03:22.50,01:03:25.00


01:03:25.50,01:03:27.00
I´m sorry, Newt.

01:03:27.50,01:03:28.00


01:03:28.50,01:03:30.00
Don´t you think you´d be safer[br]here with us?

01:03:30.50,01:03:34.00


01:03:34.50,01:03:36.00
These people are here[br]to protect you.

01:03:36.50,01:03:38.00
They´re soldiers.

01:03:38.50,01:03:41.00
It won´t make any difference.

01:03:41.50,01:03:55.00


01:03:55.50,01:03:57.00
SPUNKMEYER:[br]Need anything else?

01:03:57.50,01:03:59.00


01:03:59.50,01:04:02.00
Hello, Bishop.[br]Do you need anything else?

01:04:02.50,01:04:04.00


01:04:04.50,01:04:06.00
No.

01:04:06.50,01:04:08.00


01:04:08.50,01:04:10.00
Nice pet you got there.

01:04:10.50,01:04:14.00
Magnificent, isn´t it?

01:04:14.50,01:04:17.00
Yo! Stop your grinnin´[br]and drop your linen!

01:04:17.50,01:04:19.00
Found them.

01:04:19.50,01:04:20.00
GORMAN: They alive?

01:04:20.50,01:04:23.00
HUDSON: Unknown, but it looks[br]like all of them...

over at[br]the processing station...

01:04:26.50,01:04:28.00
sub-level three...

under the main cooling towers.

01:04:30.50,01:04:34.00
HICKS: It looks like[br]a goddamn town meeting.

01:04:34.50,01:04:36.00
Let´s saddle up, Apone.

01:04:36.50,01:04:37.00
APONE: Aye, sir.

01:04:37.50,01:04:38.00


01:04:38.50,01:04:43.00
Let´s go. They ain´t payin´ us[br]by the hour. Head ´em out.

01:04:43.50,01:04:45.00
OK, Frost, you´re driving.

01:04:45.50,01:04:57.00


01:04:57.50,01:05:00.00
It´s OK. Don´t worry.[br]It´ll be OK.

01:05:00.50,01:05:41.00


01:05:41.50,01:05:43.00
GORMAN: I want[br]a straight ´´V´´ deployment...

01:05:43.50,01:05:45.00
second team on left flank.

01:05:45.50,01:05:47.00
Advance on axial six-six-four.

01:05:47.50,01:05:52.00
Tracker on-line. Set the V-gain[br]to filter R-F ambient.

01:05:52.50,01:05:56.00
APONE: Hudson, tracker on-line.[br]Left and right, little buddy.

01:05:56.50,01:05:57.00


01:05:57.50,01:06:00.00
GORMAN: Forty meters in,[br]bearing two-two-one...

01:06:00.50,01:06:02.00
there should be a stairwell.

01:06:02.50,01:06:03.00
APONE: Check. Got it.

01:06:03.50,01:06:05.00


01:06:05.50,01:06:07.00
GORMAN:[br]You want sub-level three.

01:06:07.50,01:06:09.00


01:06:09.50,01:06:11.00
APONE: Let´s go, people.

01:06:11.50,01:06:12.00
Hudson, you got the point.

01:06:12.50,01:06:14.00
Hicks, watch our tails.

01:06:14.50,01:06:16.00
Nice and easy.

01:06:16.50,01:06:17.00
Check those corners.

01:06:17.50,01:06:19.00
Check those corners.

01:06:19.50,01:06:23.00


01:06:23.50,01:06:25.00
GORMAN: Watch your spacing.

01:06:25.50,01:06:28.00
APONE: You heard the man.[br]Don´t bunch up. Stay loose.

01:06:28.50,01:06:31.00
GORMAN: Your transmission´s[br]showing a lot of break-up.

01:06:31.50,01:06:33.00
HUDSON: Probably getting some[br]interference from the structure.

01:06:33.50,01:06:35.00
APONE: Use those lights.

01:06:35.50,01:06:37.00


01:06:37.50,01:06:42.00
GORMAN: Next one down,[br]and proceed on a two-one-six.

01:06:42.50,01:06:44.00
APONE: Roger.[br]That´s a two-one-six.

01:06:44.50,01:06:46.00


01:06:46.50,01:06:48.00
GORMAN: l´m not[br]making that out too well.

01:06:48.50,01:06:50.00
What is it, Hudson?

01:06:50.50,01:06:52.00
HUDSON:[br]You tell me. I only work here.

01:06:52.50,01:07:07.00


01:07:07.50,01:07:09.00
What is that?

01:07:09.50,01:07:12.00
I don´t know.

01:07:12.50,01:07:13.00


01:07:13.50,01:07:15.00
Proceed inside.

01:07:15.50,01:07:31.00


01:07:31.50,01:07:34.00
APONE: Watch your fire[br]and check your targets.

01:07:34.50,01:07:37.00
Remember, we´re looking[br]for civvies in here.

01:07:37.50,01:07:46.00


01:07:46.50,01:07:48.00
APONE: Easy.

01:07:48.50,01:07:51.00
HICKS: Tighten it up, Frost.[br]We´re getting a little thin.

01:07:51.50,01:07:53.00


01:07:53.50,01:07:54.00
APONE: Nice and easy.

01:07:54.50,01:07:57.00


01:07:57.50,01:07:59.00
DIETRICH: Looks like[br]some sort of secreted resin.

01:07:59.50,01:08:03.00
HICKS:[br]Yeah, but secreted from what?

01:08:03.50,01:08:06.00
APONE: Nobody touch nothing.

01:08:06.50,01:08:09.00
BURKE:[br]Busy little creatures, huh?

01:08:09.50,01:08:11.00
FROST: Hot as hell in here.

01:08:11.50,01:08:13.00
HUDSON: But it´s a dry heat.

01:08:13.50,01:08:15.00
APONE: Knock it off, Hudson.

01:08:15.50,01:08:23.00


01:08:23.50,01:08:26.00
Lieutenant,[br]what do those pulse-rifles fire?

01:08:26.50,01:08:29.00
GORMAN: Ten millimeter[br]explosive-tip caseless.

01:08:29.50,01:08:31.00
Standard light[br]armor-piercing round. Why?

01:08:31.50,01:08:33.00
RIPLEY: Look where your team is.

01:08:33.50,01:08:37.00
They´re right under[br]the primary heat exchangers.

01:08:37.50,01:08:38.00
So?

01:08:38.50,01:08:41.00
So if they fire their weapons[br]in there...

01:08:41.50,01:08:43.00
won´t they rupture[br]the cooling system?

01:08:43.50,01:08:46.00
BURKE: Oh, ho ho. Yeah.[br]She´s absolutely right.

01:08:46.50,01:08:47.00
So what?

01:08:47.50,01:08:51.00
This whole station is basically[br]a big fusion reactor.

01:08:51.50,01:08:53.00


01:08:53.50,01:08:54.00
Right?

01:08:54.50,01:08:57.00
So she´s talking about[br]a thermonuclear explosion...

01:08:57.50,01:08:58.00
and, ´´Adiós, muchachos.´´

01:08:58.50,01:08:59.00


01:08:59.50,01:09:01.00
Oh, great. Wonderful.

01:09:01.50,01:09:04.00
Shit!

01:09:04.50,01:09:06.00


01:09:06.50,01:09:07.00
Look.

01:09:07.50,01:09:10.00
Uh...Apone.

01:09:10.50,01:09:11.00


01:09:11.50,01:09:15.00
We can´t have any firing[br]in there.

01:09:15.50,01:09:18.00
I want you to collect[br]magazines from everybody.

01:09:18.50,01:09:20.00
HUDSON: ls he fuckin´ crazy?

01:09:20.50,01:09:23.00
FROST:[br]What do we use, harsh language?

01:09:23.50,01:09:25.00
GORMAN: Flame units only.[br]I want rifles slung.

01:09:25.50,01:09:26.00
APONE: Sir, l--

01:09:26.50,01:09:29.00
GORMAN: Just do it, Sergeant.[br]And no grenades.

01:09:29.50,01:09:30.00


01:09:30.50,01:09:32.00
APONE: You heard the man.

01:09:32.50,01:09:34.00
Pull ´em out. Let´s have ´em.

01:09:34.50,01:09:35.00


01:09:35.50,01:09:38.00
Come on, Vasquez.[br]Clear and lock.

01:09:38.50,01:09:41.00


01:09:41.50,01:09:42.00
Damn!

01:09:42.50,01:09:43.00


01:09:43.50,01:09:45.00
You, too. Give it up, Ski.

01:09:45.50,01:09:48.00
Crowe, I want it now.[br]Give it up.

01:09:48.50,01:09:50.00
DRAKE: Right on, Vas.

01:09:50.50,01:09:52.00


01:09:52.50,01:09:54.00
APONE: Let´s go. Give it up.

01:09:54.50,01:09:56.00
Frost, you got the duty.[br]Open that bag.

01:09:56.50,01:09:57.00
FROST: Thanks a lot, Sarge.

01:09:57.50,01:09:58.00


01:09:58.50,01:09:59.00
APONE: Hicks, cover our ass.

01:09:59.50,01:10:01.00
Head ´em out, people.

01:10:01.50,01:10:03.00


01:10:03.50,01:10:07.00
HICKS: I like to keep this handy[br]for close encounters.

01:10:07.50,01:10:09.00
FROST: I heard that.

01:10:09.50,01:10:18.00


01:10:18.50,01:10:19.00
GORMAN: Any movement?

01:10:19.50,01:10:21.00
HUDSON: Nothing.

01:10:21.50,01:10:22.00
Zip.

01:10:22.50,01:10:35.00


01:10:35.50,01:10:38.00
APONE: Holy shit.

01:10:38.50,01:10:50.00


01:10:50.50,01:10:53.00
RIPLEY: Newt, go sit up front.

01:10:53.50,01:10:54.00
Go on!

01:10:54.50,01:10:55.00
Now!

01:10:55.50,01:11:24.00


01:11:24.50,01:11:27.00
APONE: Steady, people.[br]Let´s finish our sweep.

01:11:27.50,01:11:30.00
We´re still Marines,[br]and we got a job to do.

01:11:30.50,01:11:31.00
Keep it moving.

01:11:31.50,01:11:32.00


01:11:32.50,01:11:34.00
Easy.

01:11:34.50,01:12:06.00


01:12:06.50,01:12:07.00
-Top![br]-What?

01:12:07.50,01:12:09.00
DIETRICH: We got a live one!

01:12:09.50,01:12:11.00
You´re gonna be all right.

01:12:11.50,01:12:14.00
Please...kill me.

01:12:14.50,01:12:16.00
DIETRICH:[br]Stay calm. We´ll get you out.

01:12:16.50,01:12:18.00
It´s gonna be all right.

01:12:18.50,01:12:19.00
We´ve got to get her[br]out of here.

01:12:19.50,01:12:20.00


01:12:20.50,01:12:21.00
APONE: What is it, Dietrich?[br]What´s going on?

01:12:21.50,01:12:22.00
Convulsion!

01:12:22.50,01:12:24.00
RIPLEY: Ohh!

01:12:24.50,01:12:26.00
APONE: Dietrich, get back!

01:12:26.50,01:12:28.00
Aah! Aah!

01:12:28.50,01:12:34.00


01:12:34.50,01:12:35.00
No!

APONE: Frost, flamethrower!

01:12:37.50,01:12:40.00
Get back! Flamethrower! Move!

01:13:12.50,01:13:13.00
What´s the position?

01:13:13.50,01:13:14.00


01:13:14.50,01:13:16.00
I can´t lock in!

01:13:16.50,01:13:19.00
Talk to me, Hudson!

01:13:19.50,01:13:21.00
Multiple signals.

01:13:21.50,01:13:23.00
They´re closing.

01:13:23.50,01:13:24.00

APONE: Go to infrared, people.[br]Look sharp!

01:13:28.50,01:13:31.00
GORMAN: What´s happening, Apone?[br]We can´t see anything in here.

01:13:31.50,01:13:33.00
RIPLEY:[br]Pull your team out, Gorman.

01:13:33.50,01:13:39.00


01:13:39.50,01:13:42.00
HUDSON: I got readings[br]in front and behind.

01:13:42.50,01:13:44.00
FROST: Where, man?[br]I don´t see shit.

01:13:44.50,01:13:47.00
HICKS: He´s right.[br]Nothing´s back here.

01:13:47.50,01:13:49.00
HUDSON: Something´s moving,[br]and it ain´t us!

01:13:49.50,01:13:51.00


01:13:51.50,01:13:52.00

HUDSON:[br]Tracker´s off-scale, man.

01:13:54.50,01:13:57.00
They´re all around us, man![br]Jesus!

01:13:57.50,01:14:01.00
DIETRICH: Maybe they don´t[br]show up on infrared at all.

01:14:01.50,01:14:05.00

Lay down a suppressing fire[br]with the incinerators...

and fall back by squads...

01:15:17.50,01:15:18.00

01:26:05.50,01:26:22.00


01:26:22.50,01:26:23.00
HICKS: That´s everything, right?

01:26:23.50,01:26:24.00


01:26:24.50,01:26:26.00
This is absolutely everything[br]we could salvage...

01:26:26.50,01:26:29.00
out of the APC wreckage.

01:26:29.50,01:26:33.00
We got four pulse-rifles[br]with about fifty rounds each.

01:26:33.50,01:26:35.00
That ain´t so good.

01:26:35.50,01:26:38.00
We got fifteen[br]of these M-40 grenades.

01:26:38.50,01:26:42.00
Don´t touch that.[br]Dangerous, honey.

01:26:42.50,01:26:43.00
RIPLEY:[br]ls that the only flamethrower?

01:26:43.50,01:26:44.00


01:26:44.50,01:26:47.00
HICKS: Yeah. It´s only[br]half-full, but it´s functional.

01:26:47.50,01:26:49.00
And another one´s damaged.

01:26:49.50,01:26:51.00
I don´t know about that one.

01:26:51.50,01:26:53.00
But the good news...

01:26:53.50,01:26:56.00
we got four of these[br]robot sentries...

01:26:56.50,01:26:57.00


01:26:57.50,01:27:00.00
with display[br]and scanners intact.

01:27:00.50,01:27:03.00
They really kick ass.[br]They´ll come in handy.

01:27:03.50,01:27:07.00
How long after we´re declared[br]overdue can we expect a rescue?

01:27:07.50,01:27:10.00


01:27:10.50,01:27:12.00
Seventeen days.

01:27:12.50,01:27:14.00
Seventeen days?

01:27:14.50,01:27:17.00
Hey, man, I don´t wanna[br]rain on your parade...

01:27:17.50,01:27:20.00
but we´re not gonna last[br]seventeen hours.

01:27:20.50,01:27:23.00
Those things are gonna come here[br]like they did before, and--

01:27:23.50,01:27:25.00
Hudson! Hudson!

01:27:25.50,01:27:26.00


01:27:26.50,01:27:29.00
This little girl[br]survived longer than that...

01:27:29.50,01:27:31.00
with no weapons and no training.

01:27:31.50,01:27:33.00
Right?

01:27:33.50,01:27:36.00


01:27:36.50,01:27:38.00
Why don´t you put her in charge?

01:27:38.50,01:27:40.00
You better just start[br]dealing with it, Hudson.

01:27:40.50,01:27:44.00
Deal with it,[br]because we need you...

01:27:44.50,01:27:46.00
and l´m sick of your bullshit.

01:27:46.50,01:27:51.00
Now get on a terminal[br]and call up a floor plan file.

01:27:51.50,01:27:52.00
Construction blueprints.[br]I don´t care.

01:27:52.50,01:27:53.00


01:27:53.50,01:27:54.00
Anything that shows the layout.

01:27:54.50,01:27:56.00
-Are you listening?[br]-Yeah.

01:27:56.50,01:28:00.00
RIPLEY: I need to see air ducts,[br]electrical access tunnels...

01:28:00.50,01:28:01.00
sub-basements...

01:28:01.50,01:28:02.00


01:28:02.50,01:28:04.00
every possible way[br]into this complex.

01:28:04.50,01:28:05.00


01:28:05.50,01:28:07.00
We don´t have much time.

01:28:07.50,01:28:09.00
OK.

01:28:09.50,01:28:10.00


01:28:10.50,01:28:11.00
OK, l´m on it.

01:28:11.50,01:28:12.00
RIPLEY: Hudson!

01:28:12.50,01:28:14.00
Just relax.

01:28:14.50,01:28:21.00


01:28:21.50,01:28:22.00
I´ll be in med lab.

01:28:22.50,01:28:23.00


01:28:23.50,01:28:25.00
I´ll check on Gorman,[br]continue my analysis.

01:28:25.50,01:28:26.00


01:28:26.50,01:28:27.00
Fine.

01:28:27.50,01:28:29.00
You do that.

01:28:29.50,01:28:35.00


01:28:35.50,01:28:36.00
RIPLEY: This service tunnel...

01:28:36.50,01:28:39.00
must be how[br]they´re moving back and forth.

01:28:39.50,01:28:40.00
HUDSON: That´s right.

01:28:40.50,01:28:41.00
It moves from[br]the processing station...

01:28:41.50,01:28:44.00
right into the sub-level.

01:28:44.50,01:28:45.00


01:28:45.50,01:28:47.00
Come down on that.

01:28:47.50,01:28:49.00
OK, come over.

01:28:49.50,01:28:51.00
Hold it. Go back.

01:28:51.50,01:28:52.00
Punch that in there.

01:28:52.50,01:28:57.00


01:28:57.50,01:28:59.00
HICKS: No. It´s back here.

01:28:59.50,01:29:00.00
RIPLEY: OK.

01:29:00.50,01:29:01.00


01:29:01.50,01:29:04.00
There´s a pressure door[br]at this end.

01:29:04.50,01:29:08.00
Couldn´t we put a remote[br]sentry unit in the tunnel...

01:29:08.50,01:29:09.00
then seal that door?

01:29:09.50,01:29:10.00
HICKS: That´ll work...

01:29:10.50,01:29:13.00
but we gotta figure on them[br]getting into the complex.

01:29:13.50,01:29:14.00
RIPLEY: That´s right, so...

01:29:14.50,01:29:17.00
we repair the barricades[br]at these two intersections...

01:29:17.50,01:29:18.00
HICKS: Right.

01:29:18.50,01:29:22.00
...and weld plate steel over[br]these ducts here and here...

01:29:22.50,01:29:24.00
and here.

01:29:24.50,01:29:27.00
Then they can only come at us[br]from these two corridors.

01:29:27.50,01:29:31.00
HICKS: Right. Then we put[br]the other sentry units here...

01:29:31.50,01:29:33.00
and here, right?

01:29:33.50,01:29:35.00
-Right.[br]-Outstanding.

01:29:35.50,01:29:38.00
Now all we need[br]is a deck of cards.

01:29:38.50,01:29:40.00


01:29:40.50,01:29:42.00
Let´s move[br]like we´ve got a purpose.

01:29:42.50,01:29:44.00
HUDSON: Affirmative.

01:29:44.50,01:29:45.00
NEWT: Affirmative.

01:29:45.50,01:30:00.00


01:30:00.50,01:30:02.00
HUDSON: Do your thing, baby.

01:30:02.50,01:30:05.00
Come on, Vasquez,[br]let´s get out of here.

01:30:05.50,01:30:07.00
´´A´´ and ´´B´´ sentries[br]are in place and keyed.

01:30:07.50,01:30:10.00
HICKS: Roger.[br]Stand by. Arming now.

01:30:10.50,01:30:12.00
Test it, Hudson.

01:30:12.50,01:30:14.00
-Do it.[br]-Fire in the hole!

01:30:14.50,01:30:18.00


01:30:18.50,01:30:21.00
HUDSON: Great.[br]Let´s get the hell out of here.

01:30:21.50,01:30:22.00
We´re sealing the tunnel.

01:30:22.50,01:30:24.00
Come on, baby.

01:30:24.50,01:30:36.00


01:30:36.50,01:30:38.00
HICKS: For what it´s worth.

01:30:38.50,01:30:40.00


01:30:40.50,01:30:42.00
I want you to put this on.

01:30:42.50,01:30:43.00


01:30:43.50,01:30:45.00
RIPLEY: What´s it for?

01:30:45.50,01:30:46.00
It´s a locator.

01:30:46.50,01:30:49.00
Then I can find you anywhere[br]in the complex on this.

01:30:49.50,01:30:51.00


01:30:51.50,01:30:53.00
It´s just a precaution.

01:30:53.50,01:30:54.00


01:30:54.50,01:30:55.00
Thanks.

01:30:55.50,01:30:58.00
Doesn´t mean we´re engaged[br]or anything.

01:30:58.50,01:31:00.00
All right, what´s next?

01:31:00.50,01:31:30.00


01:31:30.50,01:31:31.00
RIPLEY: Last stop.

01:31:31.50,01:31:36.00


01:31:36.50,01:31:37.00
Get in.

01:31:37.50,01:31:39.00
Scoot down.

01:31:39.50,01:31:41.00


01:31:41.50,01:31:42.00
That´s good.

01:31:42.50,01:31:45.00
Now lie here and have a nap.

01:31:45.50,01:31:46.00
You´re very tired.

01:31:46.50,01:31:50.00
I don´t want to.[br]I have scary dreams.

01:31:50.50,01:31:52.00


01:31:52.50,01:31:55.00
Well, I bet Casey[br]doesn´t have scary dreams.

01:31:55.50,01:31:57.00
Let´s take a look.

01:31:57.50,01:32:00.00
Nope. Nothing bad in there.

01:32:00.50,01:32:01.00
See?

01:32:01.50,01:32:03.00
Maybe you could just[br]try to be like her.

01:32:03.50,01:32:07.00
Ripley, she doesn´t[br]have bad dreams...

01:32:07.50,01:32:10.00
because she´s just[br]a piece of plastic.

01:32:10.50,01:32:11.00
Right.

01:32:11.50,01:32:13.00
I´m sorry, Newt.

01:32:13.50,01:32:20.00


01:32:20.50,01:32:22.00
RIPLEY: There.

01:32:22.50,01:32:25.00
My mommy always said[br]there were no monsters...

01:32:25.50,01:32:29.00
no real ones, but there are.

01:32:29.50,01:32:32.00
Yes, there are, aren´t there?

01:32:32.50,01:32:34.00


01:32:34.50,01:32:36.00
Why do they tell[br]little kids that?

01:32:36.50,01:32:38.00


01:32:38.50,01:32:40.00
Most of the time it´s true.

01:32:40.50,01:32:44.00
Did one of those things[br]grow inside her?

01:32:44.50,01:32:45.00


01:32:45.50,01:32:46.00
I don´t know, Newt.

01:32:46.50,01:32:49.00
That´s the truth.

01:32:49.50,01:32:51.00
Isn´t that how babies come--

01:32:51.50,01:32:53.00
I mean, people babies?

01:32:53.50,01:32:55.00
They grow inside you.

01:32:55.50,01:32:57.00
No. That´s very different.

01:32:57.50,01:32:59.00
NEWT: Did you ever have a baby?

01:32:59.50,01:33:00.00
Yes, I did.

01:33:00.50,01:33:02.00
I had a little girl.

01:33:02.50,01:33:04.00
Where is she?

01:33:04.50,01:33:05.00


01:33:05.50,01:33:07.00
She´s gone.

01:33:07.50,01:33:09.00


01:33:09.50,01:33:11.00
You mean dead.

01:33:11.50,01:33:12.00


01:33:12.50,01:33:14.00
Here.

01:33:14.50,01:33:15.00


01:33:15.50,01:33:17.00
Take this.

01:33:17.50,01:33:18.00


01:33:18.50,01:33:20.00
For luck.

01:33:20.50,01:33:23.00


01:33:23.50,01:33:24.00
How´s that?

01:33:24.50,01:33:28.00


01:33:28.50,01:33:29.00
Don´t go, please.

01:33:29.50,01:33:31.00
Newt, l´m gonna be[br]right in the next room.

01:33:31.50,01:33:33.00


01:33:33.50,01:33:35.00
And you see that camera?

01:33:35.50,01:33:38.00
I can see you[br]through that camera...

01:33:38.50,01:33:40.00
to see if you´re safe.

01:33:40.50,01:33:44.00


01:33:44.50,01:33:47.00
I´m not gonna leave you, Newt.

01:33:47.50,01:33:50.00
I mean that.

01:33:50.50,01:33:51.00
That´s a promise.

01:33:51.50,01:33:53.00
You promise?

01:33:53.50,01:33:54.00


01:33:54.50,01:33:56.00
I cross my heart.

01:33:56.50,01:33:58.00
And hope to die?

01:33:58.50,01:33:59.00


01:33:59.50,01:34:01.00
And hope to die.

01:34:01.50,01:34:15.00


01:34:15.50,01:34:17.00
Now go to sleep...

01:34:17.50,01:34:20.00
and don´t dream.

01:34:20.50,01:34:24.00


01:34:24.50,01:34:25.00
Sneak.

01:34:25.50,01:34:35.00


01:34:35.50,01:34:37.00
BISHOP:[br]The molecular acid oxidizes...

01:34:37.50,01:34:39.00
after the creature´s death,[br]completely neutralizing it.

01:34:39.50,01:34:43.00
Bishop, that´s interesting,[br]but it gets us nowhere.

01:34:43.50,01:34:45.00
I´m trying to figure out[br]what we´re dealing with.

01:34:45.50,01:34:47.00
Let´s go through it again.

01:34:47.50,01:34:50.00
They grab the colonists,[br]they move them over there...

01:34:50.50,01:34:54.00
and they immobilize them[br]to be hosts for more of these.

01:34:54.50,01:34:58.00
Which means there would have[br]to be a lot of these parasites.

01:34:58.50,01:35:00.00
One for each colonist.[br]That´s over a hundred, at least.

01:35:00.50,01:35:02.00
Yes. That follows.

01:35:02.50,01:35:06.00
Each one of these things[br]comes from an egg, right?

01:35:06.50,01:35:09.00


01:35:09.50,01:35:11.00
So who´s laying these eggs?

01:35:11.50,01:35:12.00


01:35:12.50,01:35:13.00
I´m not sure.

01:35:13.50,01:35:16.00
It must be something[br]we haven´t seen yet.

01:35:16.50,01:35:19.00
Hey, maybe[br]it´s like an ant hive.

01:35:19.50,01:35:22.00
-Bees have hives.[br]-You know what I mean.

01:35:22.50,01:35:25.00
There´s, like, one female[br]that runs the whole show.

01:35:25.50,01:35:27.00

01:35:33.50,01:35:35.00


01:35:35.50,01:35:37.00
Bishop, I want[br]these specimens destroyed...

01:35:37.50,01:35:39.00
as soon as[br]you´re finished with them.

01:35:39.50,01:35:41.00
Mr. Burke gave instructions...

01:35:41.50,01:35:45.00
they were to be kept alive[br]for return to the Company labs.

01:35:45.50,01:35:47.00


01:35:47.50,01:35:51.00
He was very specific about it.

01:35:51.50,01:35:53.00
Those two specimens[br]are worth millions...

01:35:53.50,01:35:55.00
to the bio-weapons division.

01:35:55.50,01:35:58.00
If you´re smart, we can both[br]come out of this heroes...

01:35:58.50,01:36:01.00
and we will be set up for life.

01:36:01.50,01:36:03.00


01:36:03.50,01:36:04.00
You´re crazy, Burke.[br]Do you know that?

01:36:04.50,01:36:07.00
Do you think you can get[br]a dangerous organism...

01:36:07.50,01:36:09.00
past ICC quarantine?

01:36:09.50,01:36:12.00
How can they impound it[br]if they don´t know about it?

01:36:12.50,01:36:15.00
But they will know[br]about it, Burke. From me.

01:36:15.50,01:36:17.00
Just like they´ll know[br]you were responsible...

01:36:17.50,01:36:20.00
for the deaths of one hundred[br]fifty-seven colonists.

01:36:20.50,01:36:21.00
BURKE: Wait a second!

01:36:21.50,01:36:23.00
-You sent them to that ship.[br]-You´re wrong.

01:36:23.50,01:36:25.00
I just checked[br]the colony log...

01:36:28.50,01:36:31.00
You sent them out there[br]and didn´t even warn them.

01:36:31.50,01:36:34.00
Why didn´t you warn them, Burke?

01:36:34.50,01:36:36.00
What if that ship[br]didn´t even exist?

01:36:36.50,01:36:38.00
Did you think about that?[br]I didn´t know.

01:36:38.50,01:36:41.00
So if I made a major[br]security situation out of it...

01:36:41.50,01:36:42.00
everybody steps in...

01:36:42.50,01:36:44.00
and there´s no[br]exclusive rights for anybody.

01:36:44.50,01:36:48.00
Nobody wins. I made a decision,[br]and it was wrong.

01:36:48.50,01:36:51.00
It was a bad call, Ripley.

01:36:51.50,01:36:54.00

I´m gonna make sure[br]they nail you right to the wall.

You´re not gonna sleaze your way[br]out of this one.

01:44:26.50,01:44:28.00
-Right.[br]-Lean into it.

01:44:28.50,01:44:30.00
HICKS:[br]All right, it will kick some.

01:44:30.50,01:44:32.00


01:44:32.50,01:44:35.00
When the counter[br]reads zero here, you...

01:44:35.50,01:44:37.00
-I press this up?[br]-That´s right.

01:44:37.50,01:44:39.00


01:44:39.50,01:44:42.00
Get another one in quick.[br]Slap it in hard.

01:44:42.50,01:44:45.00
Now you´re ready[br]to rock ´n´ roll.

01:44:45.50,01:44:46.00


01:44:46.50,01:44:48.00
-What´s this?[br]-The grenade launcher.

01:44:48.50,01:44:49.00


01:44:49.50,01:44:51.00
I don´t think you want[br]to mess with that.

01:44:51.50,01:44:55.00
You started this.[br]Show me everything.

01:44:55.50,01:44:57.00
I can handle myself.

01:44:57.50,01:44:59.00


01:44:59.50,01:45:01.00
Yeah, I noticed.

01:45:01.50,01:45:11.00


01:45:11.50,01:45:13.00
RIPLEY: How do you feel?

01:45:13.50,01:45:17.00
GORMAN: All right, I guess.[br]One hell of a hangover.

01:45:17.50,01:45:19.00
Look, Ripley, I just want--

01:45:19.50,01:45:22.00
RIPLEY: Forget it. Excuse me.

01:45:22.50,01:46:14.00


01:46:14.50,01:46:17.00
[Newt moaning]

01:46:17.50,01:46:19.00
RIPLEY: Shh, shh, shh.

01:46:19.50,01:46:22.00
It´s OK. It´s OK.

01:46:22.50,01:47:32.00


01:47:32.50,01:47:35.00
[Whispering][br]Newt. Wake up.

01:47:35.50,01:47:38.00
-What?[br]-Be quiet.

01:47:38.50,01:47:40.00
We´re in trouble.

01:47:40.50,01:47:58.00


01:47:58.50,01:48:00.00
-No![br]-Aah!

01:48:00.50,01:48:02.00
Move, Newt!

01:48:02.50,01:48:24.00


01:48:24.50,01:48:25.00
RIPLEY: Hey!

01:48:25.50,01:48:26.00
[No sound]

01:48:26.50,01:48:34.00


01:48:34.50,01:48:36.00
NEWT: Help!

01:48:36.50,01:48:38.00
Help!

01:48:38.50,01:48:40.00
RIPLEY: Hicks!

01:48:40.50,01:48:42.00
HICKS: Say again, Bishop?

01:48:42.50,01:48:44.00
You´ve got it[br]into auto-refuel mode...

01:48:44.50,01:48:45.00
and it´s sequencing right?

01:48:45.50,01:48:47.00
BISHOP: That´s right.

01:48:47.50,01:48:49.00
HICKS: Good. Stay on it.

01:48:49.50,01:48:54.00
Get back to me when you´ve[br]activated the launch cycle.

01:48:54.50,01:48:56.00
He´s at the uplink tower.

01:48:56.50,01:48:57.00
BURKE: Terrific.

01:48:57.50,01:49:00.00


01:49:00.50,01:49:04.00
-Hicks! Hicks![br]-Help! Help!

01:49:04.50,01:49:06.00
Hicks! Help us!

01:49:06.50,01:49:07.00
Break the glass!

01:49:07.50,01:49:09.00
Break it, break it.

01:49:09.50,01:49:11.00
RIPLEY: l´ll try.

01:49:11.50,01:49:32.00


01:49:32.50,01:49:35.00
Ripley, l´m scared.

01:49:35.50,01:49:37.00
Me, too.

01:49:37.50,01:49:42.00


01:49:42.50,01:49:44.00
Stay here.

01:49:44.50,01:49:53.00


01:49:53.50,01:49:56.00
[Alarm sounds]

01:49:56.50,01:49:59.00
HICKS: lt´s the med lab.[br]Hudson!

01:49:59.50,01:50:03.00
Vasquez! Meet me in med lab.[br]We got a fire.

01:50:03.50,01:50:04.00
HUDSON: We´re on our way.

01:50:04.50,01:50:07.00


01:50:07.50,01:50:11.00
They´re coming, Newt.[br]Oh, please.

01:50:11.50,01:50:16.00


01:50:16.50,01:50:17.00
Aah!

01:50:17.50,01:50:18.00
Uh!

01:50:18.50,01:50:25.00


01:50:25.50,01:50:26.00
Aah!

01:50:26.50,01:50:33.00


01:50:33.50,01:50:35.00
Aah!

01:50:35.50,01:50:37.00
Aah!

01:50:37.50,01:50:42.00


01:50:42.50,01:50:44.00
Shoot it out!

01:50:44.50,01:50:48.00


01:50:48.50,01:50:50.00
-Hudson![br]-Jesus!

01:50:50.50,01:50:52.00


01:50:52.50,01:50:53.00
Oh!

01:50:53.50,01:50:54.00


01:50:54.50,01:50:55.00
Christ, kid, look out!

01:50:55.50,01:51:03.00


01:51:03.50,01:51:05.00
Fucking die!

01:51:05.50,01:51:16.00


01:51:16.50,01:51:18.00
-Over there![br]-Yeah!

01:51:18.50,01:51:20.00
-Ready?[br]-Yeah!

01:51:20.50,01:51:24.00


01:51:24.50,01:51:25.00
HICKS: Hudson!

01:51:25.50,01:51:28.00
HUDSON: Yeah, all clear.[br]Nailed the other one.

01:51:28.50,01:51:30.00
It´s history, man.

01:51:30.50,01:51:31.00


01:51:31.50,01:51:32.00
HICKS: Jesus.

01:51:32.50,01:51:34.00


01:51:34.50,01:51:37.00
RIPLEY: Burke. It was Burke.

01:51:37.50,01:51:39.00


01:51:39.50,01:51:43.00
I say we grease this rat-fuck[br]son of a bitch right now.

01:51:43.50,01:51:46.00
HICKS: It just doesn´t make[br]any goddamn sense.

01:51:46.50,01:51:48.00


01:51:48.50,01:51:51.00
RIPLEY: He figured[br]that he could get an alien...

01:51:51.50,01:51:56.00
back through quarantine[br]if one of us was impregnated...

01:51:56.50,01:51:59.00
whatever you call it--

01:51:59.50,01:52:02.00
and then frozen[br]for the trip home.

01:52:02.50,01:52:07.00
Nobody would know about[br]the embryos we were carrying...

01:52:07.50,01:52:08.00
me and Newt.

01:52:08.50,01:52:10.00


01:52:10.50,01:52:12.00
Wait, now. We´d all know.

01:52:12.50,01:52:16.00
Yes. He could only do it by[br]sabotaging certain freezers...

01:52:16.50,01:52:19.00
on the way home, namely yours.

01:52:19.50,01:52:20.00


01:52:20.50,01:52:25.00
He could jettison the bodies[br]and make up any story he liked.

01:52:25.50,01:52:28.00
HUDSON: Fuck! He´s dead.

01:52:28.50,01:52:30.00
You´re dog meat, pal.

01:52:30.50,01:52:31.00


01:52:31.50,01:52:36.00
This is so nuts.[br]Listen to what you´re saying.

01:52:36.50,01:52:40.00
It´s paranoid delusion.[br]It´s really sad.

01:52:40.50,01:52:42.00


01:52:42.50,01:52:43.00
It´s pathetic.

01:52:43.50,01:52:47.00
Burke, I don´t know[br]which species is worse.

01:52:47.50,01:52:51.00
They don´t fuck each other over[br]for a goddamn percentage.

01:52:51.50,01:52:54.00
HICKS: All right, we waste him.[br]No offense.

01:52:54.50,01:52:56.00
RIPLEY:[br]No, he´s got to go back--

01:52:56.50,01:52:57.00


01:52:57.50,01:52:59.00
They cut the power.

01:52:59.50,01:53:02.00
HUDSON: What do you mean ´´they´´[br]cut the power? They´re animals.

01:53:02.50,01:53:05.00
I want you two with trackers[br]checking the corridors! Move!

01:53:05.50,01:53:07.00
-Gorman, watch Burke.[br]-I got him.

01:53:07.50,01:53:09.00
Newt, stay close.

01:53:09.50,01:53:12.00


01:53:12.50,01:53:15.00
-I´ll go this side.[br]-You do that, man.

01:53:15.50,01:53:39.00


01:53:39.50,01:53:40.00
Anything?

01:53:40.50,01:53:41.00


01:53:41.50,01:53:42.00
HUDSON: There´s something.

01:53:42.50,01:53:45.00
-[Beeping][br]-It´s inside the complex.

01:53:45.50,01:53:46.00


01:53:46.50,01:53:47.00
You´re just reading me.

01:53:47.50,01:53:50.00
-[Beeping][br]-No, it ain´t you.

01:53:50.50,01:53:52.00


01:53:52.50,01:53:56.00
They´re inside the perimeter.[br]They´re in here.

01:53:56.50,01:53:59.00
RIPLEY: Hudson, stay cool.[br]Vasquez?

01:53:59.50,01:54:04.00


01:54:04.50,01:54:06.00
[Beeps louder]

01:54:06.50,01:54:08.00
Hudson may be right.

01:54:08.50,01:54:10.00
RIPLEY: Get back.

01:54:10.50,01:54:11.00
HUDSON: The signal´s weird.

01:54:11.50,01:54:15.00
Must be some interference[br]or something.

01:54:15.50,01:54:17.00
There´s movement[br]all over the place.

01:54:17.50,01:54:21.00
Get back to Operations.[br]It´s game time.

01:54:21.50,01:54:22.00
Newt.

01:54:22.50,01:54:24.00


01:54:24.50,01:54:28.00
RIPLEY: Seal the door. Hurry!

01:54:28.50,01:54:31.00
HICKS: Come on.[br]Come on, get back.

01:54:31.50,01:54:33.00
Work fast.

01:54:33.50,01:54:37.00


01:54:37.50,01:54:40.00
Cover your eyes, Newt.[br]Don´t look at the light.

01:54:40.50,01:54:44.00
Movement. Signal´s clean.[br]Range, twenty meters.

01:54:44.50,01:54:47.00
RIPLEY: They found a way in,[br]something we missed.

01:54:47.50,01:54:49.00
HICKS: We didn´t miss anything.

01:54:49.50,01:54:53.00
HUDSON: Eighteen.[br]Seventeen meters.

01:54:53.50,01:54:56.00
RIPLEY: Something under[br]the floor, not in the plans.

01:54:56.50,01:54:58.00
-Fifteen meters.[br]-Ripley!

01:54:58.50,01:55:00.00
Definitely[br]inside the barricades.

01:55:00.50,01:55:01.00
Let´s go.

01:55:01.50,01:55:03.00


01:55:03.50,01:55:05.00
RIPLEY: That´s right outside[br]the door. Get back!

01:55:05.50,01:55:08.00
HUDSON:[br]This is a big fucking signal.

01:55:08.50,01:55:11.00
-How you doing, Vasquez?[br]-Almost there.

01:55:11.50,01:55:12.00


01:55:12.50,01:55:14.00
That´s it.

01:55:14.50,01:55:15.00


01:55:15.50,01:55:16.00
HUDSON: Twelve meters.

01:55:16.50,01:55:17.00


01:55:17.50,01:55:20.00
Eleven. Ten.

01:55:20.50,01:55:23.00
-They´re right on us.[br]-Nine meters.

01:55:23.50,01:55:25.00
Remember--[br]short, controlled bursts.

01:55:25.50,01:55:27.00
Eight meters.

01:55:27.50,01:55:29.00


01:55:29.50,01:55:30.00
Seven.

01:55:30.50,01:55:32.00


01:55:32.50,01:55:33.00
Six.

01:55:33.50,01:55:37.00
-That´s inside the room.[br]-It´s reading right!

01:55:37.50,01:55:38.00
You´re not reading it right.

01:55:38.50,01:55:41.00


01:55:41.50,01:55:46.00
HUDSON: Five meters, man.[br]Four. What the hell?

01:55:46.50,01:55:48.00


01:55:48.50,01:55:50.00
HUDSON: Oh, my God.

01:55:50.50,01:55:52.00
HICKS: Give me the light.

01:55:52.50,01:56:07.00


01:56:07.50,01:56:08.00
Aah!

01:56:08.50,01:56:10.00


01:56:10.50,01:56:12.00
There they go! Get them !

01:56:12.50,01:56:14.00


01:56:14.50,01:56:17.00
-Come on![br]-Get them !

01:56:17.50,01:56:18.00


01:56:18.50,01:56:19.00
BURKE: Do something, Gorman!

01:56:19.50,01:56:21.00


01:56:21.50,01:56:23.00
HUDSON: Look out! Look out![br]Look out!

01:56:23.50,01:56:25.00
There´s more of them !

01:56:25.50,01:56:27.00
Medical! Get to medical!

01:56:27.50,01:56:29.00
Do it! Now!

01:56:29.50,01:56:30.00


01:56:30.50,01:56:31.00
HICKS: Hudson, look out!

01:56:31.50,01:56:33.00


01:56:33.50,01:56:36.00
Aah!

01:56:36.50,01:56:38.00
Now!

01:56:38.50,01:56:40.00


01:56:40.50,01:56:41.00
Burke!

01:56:41.50,01:56:43.00


01:56:43.50,01:56:48.00
Open this door![br]Burke! Open it!

01:56:48.50,01:56:50.00
Aah!

01:56:50.50,01:56:52.00
Come on! Let´s go![br]Fall back!

01:56:52.50,01:56:54.00


01:56:54.50,01:56:55.00
HICKS: Go!

01:56:55.50,01:56:58.00
HUDSON: Die, you bastards![br]Die, motherfucker!

01:56:58.50,01:57:00.00
GORMAN: Burke!

01:57:00.50,01:57:02.00
HICKS: Hudson!

BISHOP: He´s gonna be all right.

02:23:00.50,02:23:04.00
He´s just out. I had to give him[br]another shot for the pain.

02:23:04.50,02:23:07.00
We need a stretcher[br]to carry him up to medical.

02:23:07.50,02:23:09.00

That platform[br]was becoming too unstable.

02:23:19.50,02:23:21.00
I had to circle and hope[br]things didn´t get too rough...

02:23:21.50,02:23:22.00
to take you off.

02:23:22.50,02:23:26.00
