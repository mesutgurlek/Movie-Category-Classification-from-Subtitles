1
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,208
-Valik's here!
-He's here?

2
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:16,481
They've found another one.

3
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,481
There's going to be not a treasure left
by the time she gets here.

4
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:21,066
Mark the location!

5
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,546
That's the French mast!

6
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:26,318
And over there, crystals!

7
00:03:26,478 --> 00:03:27,731
They're all coming.

8
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:30,000
All except one

9
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,152
All right, follow Crystals.

10
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:34,868
When he dives, we dive.

11
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,206
Maybe we'll get luck and find what it is down there.

12
00:03:40,948 --> 00:03:42,714
Hey! Look at that, Jimmy, look!

13
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:44,705
Why isn't she slowing down?

14
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,663
-You ask her.
-No way.

15
00:04:14,245 --> 00:04:16,393
Hello, boys! You're wet!

16
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:21,132
Half the world's trade is already here.

17
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:22,174
And you make us wait.

18
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,478
But you know I can't resist to be defied.

19
00:04:28,422 --> 00:04:30,994
Lara, tell us, what's all this fuss about it?

20
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:32,988
What does everyone think is down there?

21
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:35,033
I don't know what everybody thinks is down there, but

22
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:37,454
I think it's the Luna Temp.

23
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:39,582
The Luna Temp?

24
00:04:40,494 --> 00:04:43,520
My sons, if it is not on television, forget it.

25
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:45,533
It's a temple built by Alexander the Great.

26
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:47,663
who was Greek, in case you don't know.
-Yeah, yeah.

27
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:49,895
Alexander collected treasures from all over the world.

28
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:51,854
He stored them in two places.

29
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:54,490
The majority went to his library in Egypt.

30
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:57,786
But his most priced possessions,

31
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,193
went here,

32
00:04:59,503 --> 00:05:00,690
the Luna Temple.

33
00:05:01,363 --> 00:05:03,877
By law, no one was allowed to record its location.

34
00:05:03,878 --> 00:05:05,880
And in 330 B.C., it was...

35
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:07,808
swallowed by the sea...

36
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,199
destroyed, during a volcanic eruption,

37
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,050
lost forever,

38
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:14,327
until yesterday.

39
00:05:16,154 --> 00:05:17,789
Even half the temple is intact,

40
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:21,053
it would still be the greatest find
since the pyramids.

41
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,242
The others heading to this area here
along the shore

42
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:26,219
-That's based on the currents.
-Yes.

43
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,660
-Oh. This is it goes, it's why I was late. -Oh.

44
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:31,897
It's geological.

45
00:05:32,153 --> 00:05:33,863
Take him two hours after the quake.

46
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:35,439
The epic enter was here,

47
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,558
five miles northeast of us.

48
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:40,579
But, look at the current along the shore now

49
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:45,080
Wait, they've shifted.

50
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:47,529
So, while they're all diving there,

51
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,349
the wind will actually be...

52
00:05:51,982 --> 00:05:52,656
Here.

53
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:55,491
Let's go!

54
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,126
Something wrong?

55
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,945
First Alexander doesn't report the temple's location.

56
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:27,355
Then God washed it from the earth
with a volcano.

57
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:30,143
Now even the currents changed.

58
00:06:30,903 --> 00:06:35,513
Lara, maybe this temple is not meant to be found.

59
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:38,609
Everything lost is meant to be found.

60
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:41,615
Don't worry!

61
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:47,565
Incredible!

62
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:50,960
It's unbelievable!

63
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:53,722
God!

64
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:55,100
It's huge.

65
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:03,468
Wonderful!

66
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:06,584
Jimmy, this is wonderful

67
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:11,153
-Do you see what I see?
-Oh my god!

68
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,697
Oh my god!
-It's incredible!

69
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:16,555
Nicky, look at these!

70
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:18,394
We're going to be rich!

71
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:24,275
Hey, Lara!

72
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,006
What do you say to two handsome Greek partners?

73
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:30,529
When you find two, let me know.

74
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:32,821
Heard? She's talking about you. -No, you

75
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:39,877
Luckily gold coins...give me that...

76
00:10:18,046 --> 00:10:19,792
Lara, what is that?

77
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:21,573
It's mine.

78
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:36,625
What is she doing?

79
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:02,359
Lara! That column is collapsing!

80
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:12,317
After shows.

81
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,468
I think that's the sign leave!

82
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,711
Two minutes.

83
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:18,851
Lara, we need to leave now!

84
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:20,568
We've got to go!

85
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:34,321
-Keep packing! -Do you think it's going to collapse?
-You take those two.

86
00:11:35,348 --> 00:11:36,631
We have to hurry up!

87
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:38,788
We're going to go,
we're going to go now. Come on!

88
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:14,938
They're coming up!

89
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:35,963
Lara!

90
00:16:36,112 --> 00:16:38,283
Lara, it's us, Hillary and Bryce!

91
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:44,738
She's disorientated, that's normal after three days.

92
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,234
Nice day for a dip?

93
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,331
Gentlemen, there is an expression,

94
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,548
"It's not nice to fool mother nature."

95
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:02,156
Yet that is precisely what
I've been doing for some time now.

96
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:08,934
The will be sorren gas for Mr. Zap.

97
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:12,828
improved typhoid for Mr. Croft to use in the Balkans...

98
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,417
enhanced colorof for Mr. Devalia

99
00:17:15,418 --> 00:17:19,043
But, while these weapons served their purpose,

100
00:17:19,258 --> 00:17:22,473
there have always been limitations.

101
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,517
Stable diseases aren't lethal.

102
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:29,008
deadly ones burn out too quickly.

103
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:32,631
Mother Nature can only be fooled so much.

104
00:17:34,523 --> 00:17:38,104
Deploy my weapon, and your enemies, however great,

105
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:40,598
will collapse...

106
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,758
not unlike Mr. Monza is collapsing right now

107
00:17:58,262 --> 00:18:00,282
What the hell is going on?

108
00:18:00,283 --> 00:18:03,439
Monza told MI-6 about this meeting.

109
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,648
That's why the changed orfication

110
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,952
He was going to turn me over

111
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:10,040
to the menasic asylum of the West

112
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:16,599
A smart man would have known
I was onto him.

113
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,166
would never have got on the plane

114
00:18:18,466 --> 00:18:20,646
but I knew you would, Mr. Monze

115
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:23,624
because you actually thought you could fool me.

116
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:29,570
That, gentlemen,

117
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,209
is the sound of a traitor dying.

118
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:45,316
That was an accelerated form of Ebola,

119
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:47,165
the deadliest disease known to man

120
00:18:48,187 --> 00:18:49,509
highly contagious

121
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:56,083
However, as with all known diseases

122
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:59,508
there exist dog piles of anti serums in the West.

123
00:19:27,928 --> 00:19:31,538
There is no anti-serum for what I'm offering you

124
00:19:32,288 --> 00:19:33,164
no treatment

125
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:34,951
no vaccine, no cure.

126
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:38,903
The modern world has never seen
anything like what I've uncovered.

127
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:40,298
Uncovered?

128
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:42,964
Yes, I branched that.

129
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:44,647
Archaeology.

130
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:53,851
07744681, that is the account at the
largest bank in Bonn.

131
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:58,585
$100 million dollars each, if you please.

132
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,480
[Hong Kong Chai Wan Private Airport]

133
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,150
Where's Chen Lo?

134
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:26,723
He's got the orb, but MI-6 is onto him.

135
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:28,222
How?

136
00:20:28,223 --> 00:20:28,918
He doesn't he know,

137
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:31,419
but rather than risk bringing it to you,
he's waiting.

138
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:35,220
I have just told a cabin full of men
about Pandora.

139
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:37,321
the clock cannot be researched

140
00:20:37,322 --> 00:20:39,900
Tell Chen Lo to bring the orb to me at once.

141
00:20:58,863 --> 00:20:59,664
Find the killers,

142
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:01,254
don't take it out on me

143
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:21,301
Bryce, what have we got?

144
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:23,835
I haven't even finished loading
the images from your camera yet.

145
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:30,615
We've got references to an orb.

146
00:21:30,616 --> 00:21:32,170
I took the liberty of checking.

147
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:34,994
Historic inventories of the Luna Temple
do not list any ore.

148
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:36,861
I want you both to list

149
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:40,027
every orb ever mentioned in Greek history.

150
00:21:44,362 --> 00:21:47,125
Ah

151
00:21:52,165 --> 00:21:56,676
That's a...libel...to be.

152
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:01,980
Thousands

153
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,457
Then we'll read thousands

154
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:10,976
Start with that one.

155
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:09,141
Perhaps you gentlemen would like
some tea while you're waiting?

156
00:23:09,142 --> 00:23:11,009
No, they wouldn't.

157
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,069
Tea is for guests.

158
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,224
The door is for intruders.

159
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,303
Lara, these men are from MI-6.

160
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:21,813
Yes, I can tell from their soft hands and pressed suits.

161
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:23,197
that these are the men who made decisions

162
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,522
and leave the dirty work for others

163
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:26,111
I have no interest in...

164
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:27,213
His name is Chen Lo

165
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,336
along with his brother Xien,

166
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:32,916
he run a gang of Chinese bandits
known as Shay Ling.

167
00:23:33,318 --> 00:23:36,097
They deal in gun, diamonds and antiquities, anything that

168
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:37,990
Chen Lo can sell them in the black market.

169
00:23:38,191 --> 00:23:40,449
They've followed you the moment
you arrived at Santralina.

170
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,853
where they killed your friend Gus
and sank his boat.

171
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:43,800
Why?

172
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:44,702
For this.

173
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:47,638
After you were picked up in sea

174
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:49,970
our listening post in Mota intercepted that fax

175
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:53,071
it was sent from Chen Lo to a
man named Jonathan Reiss.

176
00:23:53,072 --> 00:23:54,060
What, a scientist?

177
00:23:54,511 --> 00:23:55,814
won a Nobel Prize.

178
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:59,173
He is now the foremost designer of
biological weapons in the world.

179
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:01,414
His creation has been in the heart of

180
00:24:01,415 --> 00:24:04,316
every active bio-terror in the past 15 years.

181
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:07,091
Reiss's disdain for life is legendary.

182
00:24:07,092 --> 00:24:07,775
He has no political agenda,

183
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:09,845
He doesn't care who his weapons kill or why.

184
00:24:11,882 --> 00:24:13,885
A modern-day Dr. Mengelen.

185
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:20,861
We know Chen Lo followed you
in order to obtain the orb.

186
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:22,709
we also know he'll deliver it to Reiss.

187
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,129
What we don't know is why.

188
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,415
Candidly, that terrifies us

189
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:31,071
Pandora's box.

190
00:24:34,817 --> 00:24:37,844
Reiss is going to use the orb
to find Pandora's Box.

191
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:40,696
Do you mean the Greek myth?

192
00:24:41,562 --> 00:24:43,200
Pandora was given a box by God,

193
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:44,364
told not to open it, she does

194
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:45,869
and unleashes pain into the world.

195
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:48,316
That's the Sunday school version, yes.

196
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,577
How do you think life began?

197
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:54,405
Shooting stars, primordial ooze.

198
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:58,205
In 2200 B.C.. an Egyptian pharaoh

199
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:00,448
found a place he named the
Cradle of Life

200
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:03,269
where, we life, we began

201
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,137
and there he found a box

202
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:07,247
the box which brought life to earth

203
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:08,601
the pharaoh opened the box

204
00:25:08,602 --> 00:25:11,418
but all that was left inside
was ramonte, or empty life,

205
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:14,572
the plague which came as the companion to life.

206
00:25:14,644 --> 00:25:15,617
Companion?

207
00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:17,454
Nature is about balance.

208
00:25:17,455 --> 00:25:19,179
All the world comes and passes.

209
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,187
yin and yang, right and wrong, men and women,

210
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:22,486
what's a pleasure with pain?

211
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,044
What did this plague do?

212
00:25:24,045 --> 00:25:25,680
It leveled the pharaoh's army.

213
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,057
The pharaohs's son dispatched

214
00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:29,871
the finest soldiers to take the box,

215
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,772
and transport it to the end of the world.

216
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:38,819
2000 years later, Alexander the Great reached India

217
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:41,184
where his army was ravaged by a plague.

218
00:25:41,264 --> 00:25:44,873
After one of his men found a box
among some of the men

219
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:47,286
India, that's what the pharaoh's men wrote it.

220
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:49,698
Alexander felt that

221
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:51,535
the box was too powerful to be trusted to
any man

222
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,926
so he returned it to its home
the Cradle of Life.

223
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:56,655
And it has not been seen since.

224
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,136
And this Cradle of Life is where?

225
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:01,142
No one knows.

226
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:03,069
Alexander found it using a map
that was with the box.

227
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:05,827
a map he then hid from the world

228
00:26:05,828 --> 00:26:08,167
But the name he gave this map

229
00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:13,344
was Mati and the literal translation for
the word Mati is "eye".

230
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:16,292
it orbits the map

231
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:19,477
hidden in the Luna Temple by Alexander

232
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,852
And Reiss will use it to find
Pandora's Box

233
00:26:21,853 --> 00:26:23,566
And when he does he opens it

234
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:34,540
The markings definitely form a pattern, but

235
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:37,698
even if I figure out what they represent

236
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:38,298
we still can't read the whole map

237
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,653
because we're going to get past
the view of these, see?

238
00:26:41,953 --> 00:26:43,656
We have to figure out how to read it.

239
00:26:43,657 --> 00:26:44,901
Right, thank you.

240
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,668
On behalf of her Majesty, we firmly request

241
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:51,268
that you find and recover this box before Dr. Reiss.

242
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:55,747
Oh! Now that I have her Majesty's permission

243
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,390
Tell me where to find the orb.

244
00:26:58,274 --> 00:27:00,379
The last we heard, it was somewhere in China

245
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,712
with Chen Lo and Sha Ling

246
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:03,752
finding them would be never to impossible

247
00:27:03,753 --> 00:27:05,623
we'll assign two of our best agents to help.

248
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,619
I don't want them.

249
00:27:07,387 --> 00:27:10,267
With due respect, your expertise is archaeology, doesn't...

250
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:11,809
I didn't say that I don't need help

251
00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:14,627
But your agents would never get me to Chen Lo in time

252
00:27:14,728 --> 00:27:17,740
I need an insider
someone who knows the Shei Ling

253
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,977
their methods, their hideouts.

254
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,899
I need Terry Sheridan.

255
00:27:25,503 --> 00:27:26,529
Not in a million year

256
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:28,265
not if you're the last man on earth.

257
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,537
Terry Sheridan, former commander of the Royal Marine

258
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:35,795
turned a mercenary, and a traitor.

259
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:38,350
You don't honestly expect me to put that man

260
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:39,219
on a trail to hold weapons

261
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,002
you can turn around and
sell to the highest bidder?

262
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:48,634
[Kazahkstan, Barla Kala Prison]

263
00:27:58,085 --> 00:27:59,574
Open!

264
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:03,213
I'm your host, Armika.

265
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,701
Welcome to Fantasy Island!

266
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:58,802
Croft.

267
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,177
Hello, Terry.

268
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,523
So what do you think of my new place?

269
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,548
Not quite Croft manner.

270
00:29:16,872 --> 00:29:18,424
What, a key to your heart?

271
00:29:19,253 --> 00:29:21,096
To a flat in Zurich.

272
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:25,671
You can pick another city if you want.

273
00:29:25,576 --> 00:29:28,267
Your record will be expound, your citizenship restored.

274
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:28,924
Why?

275
00:29:29,306 --> 00:29:30,397
MI-6.

276
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:31,557
MI-6.

277
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:33,834
Now, without meet me first with devil?

278
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,260
Well, you can pick one.

279
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:39,361
because MI-6 would also arrange a new identity

280
00:29:39,563 --> 00:29:41,688
Oh yeah, do you think I need their help?

281
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:44,353
Oh, having two faces doesn't count.

282
00:29:46,114 --> 00:29:48,166
So what do I have to do?

283
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:50,825
You need to take me to the Shay Ling.

284
00:29:50,826 --> 00:29:51,710
She who?

285
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:53,892
There's a man named Chen Lo

286
00:29:53,937 --> 00:29:56,352
who took something from me and
I want it back.

287
00:29:56,353 --> 00:29:58,739
Yeah. Is that you, or MI-6?

288
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:00,468
Also, I've arranged the government

289
00:30:00,469 --> 00:30:02,837
to wire you 5 million in sterling
when we succeed.

290
00:30:02,837 --> 00:30:04,724
you can call it second chance, man.

291
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:06,026
All right, then insurance for you?

292
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:08,101
I don't need any.

293
00:30:12,528 --> 00:30:14,609
You and I working alone?

294
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,254
And it's easier to see through you, that way.

295
00:30:18,592 --> 00:30:20,582
So what if afterwards

296
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:24,820
MI-6 decide that me back in the world
isn't such a great idea?

297
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:29,150
Then I'll feel sorry for whomever
they get to come after you.

298
00:30:33,452 --> 00:30:36,145
Do you have authorization to kill me, Croft?

299
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:38,251
Any time, for any reason.

300
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:40,436
So why don't you just do it now?

301
00:30:40,437 --> 00:30:43,070
What is it they see?

302
00:30:43,071 --> 00:30:45,413
Hell have no fury.

303
00:30:45,414 --> 00:30:46,446
You're not that good.

304
00:30:47,251 --> 00:30:49,742
Shay Ling and the groove's Croft.

305
00:30:51,546 --> 00:30:52,993
They move constantly.

306
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,691
And they're in almost the most
remote mountain region in China.

307
00:30:57,104 --> 00:30:58,391
Region?

308
00:30:59,243 --> 00:31:00,892
You have to do better than that.

309
00:31:13,722 --> 00:31:17,892
Get me into China, and I'll get you to them in a day.

310
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:22,236
No guns, no women, no weapons, when you come.

311
00:31:41,743 --> 00:31:43,796
Shay Ling has spies all over China.

312
00:31:43,797 --> 00:31:45,770
We have to get into country undetected

313
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:48,142
so we'll slip into Beijing, and we go by truck.

314
00:31:48,142 --> 00:31:48,879
Truck?

315
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:52,369
I wasn't thinking about
something a little faster.

316
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:00,538
A little faster?

317
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:07,313
Well, this is a little faster.
But the Chinese will pick the part.

318
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,627
There won't be any part to find.

319
00:32:11,646 --> 00:32:13,306
Will there be any of us to fight?

320
00:32:21,018 --> 00:32:23,245
-Ready? now!
-Ready for what?

321
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:45,691
What you did was good, Croft.
I'll give you that.

322
00:32:46,871 --> 00:32:49,930
But we're never going to feign
the equal of a place like this

323
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:55,933
ni3 hao3

324
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:56,619
ni3 hao3

325
00:32:57,787 --> 00:32:59,261
It's lovely to see you

326
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:04,129
So is everything ready?

327
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:08,295
Yes. Your clothes, guns, and knives, are over there.

328
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:12,832
And I took the liberty of tuning your bike.

329
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:14,747
-May I?
-Yes.

330
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:33,676
Lara.

331
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:36,175
Ah, what is the happy couple up to?

332
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:37,814
Accessorizing.

333
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:40,504
Where are we all on reading the orb?

334
00:33:40,505 --> 00:33:43,328
All maps have a key, Lara, scale or legend, yes?

335
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:45,364
The orb's key is not on orbit,

336
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:46,426
it must have been lost.

337
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:48,637
or somewhere in the temple

338
00:33:48,938 --> 00:33:50,859
Go through every image I took

339
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:52,294
start with the ones near the orb.

340
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:55,419
key must have been linked to it in some way.

341
00:33:55,591 --> 00:33:58,445
Right, well then...

342
00:33:58,446 --> 00:34:01,304
It's unlike Lara to take a partner.

343
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,251
Where are you two going?

344
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:05,742
We're taking a nice little trip.

345
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,893
breathe some fresh mountain air

346
00:34:09,493 --> 00:34:11,792
stop by my friends the Shay Ling

347
00:34:24,876 --> 00:34:27,131
Shay Ling watch all the roads.

348
00:34:27,227 --> 00:34:28,782
We have to go around the back.

349
00:34:28,782 --> 00:34:30,337
We'll go straight.

350
00:34:31,252 --> 00:34:32,252
Maybe you didn't hear me

351
00:34:32,854 --> 00:34:35,857
Shay Ling have men on every road
from here to Luo Yang.

352
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:38,314
Not every road.

353
00:35:12,251 --> 00:35:13,996
Getting rusty, are we?

354
00:35:13,997 --> 00:35:15,288
Oh, I think it's coming back.

355
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,187
I expect the move is gone.

356
00:35:18,187 --> 00:35:20,969
I don't expect anything from an English woman.

357
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:23,661
Good, cause you're not going to get anything.

358
00:36:03,574 --> 00:36:04,696
Party's over.

359
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,154
From now on it's by foot.

360
00:36:10,447 --> 00:36:13,018
I see you can reconsider that no gun rule.

361
00:36:13,419 --> 00:36:14,076
No.

362
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:27,533
And don't be looking at my ass.

363
00:36:29,784 --> 00:36:31,194
So where do I fit in?

364
00:36:31,195 --> 00:36:32,281
What do you mean?

365
00:36:32,282 --> 00:36:33,010
You'll the guide.

366
00:36:33,011 --> 00:36:35,378
I mean...when you think back

367
00:36:35,379 --> 00:36:38,468
on the vast scheme of hugely adventurous life

368
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,681
where do I fit in?

369
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:42,595
Is that a love of your life?

370
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:44,684
Or just another bump on the road?

371
00:36:45,185 --> 00:36:47,285
Was that time well spent?

372
00:36:47,227 --> 00:36:48,828
Four months, whether good or bad.

373
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,170
Come on I had to be more than that, am I right?

374
00:36:56,452 --> 00:36:57,367
All right.

375
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:00,341
It was five months.

376
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:04,471
You're not laughing at me?

377
00:37:04,645 --> 00:37:06,897
No. It's the fact that I used to find you charming.

378
00:37:09,473 --> 00:37:10,940
I am charming.

379
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:38,951
You're late.

380
00:37:44,707 --> 00:37:47,628
The bank, do it.

381
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,798
You won't see again in a hour, maybe.

382
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:07,208
What's this?

383
00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:09,284
It's not there.

384
00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:11,267
There's no orb.

385
00:38:13,315 --> 00:38:15,237
Is it anything you can tell me about this?

386
00:38:31,738 --> 00:38:32,460
Hello.

387
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,853
I take it you don't like your messenger

388
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,374
I didn't, but I did like the men lost in a temple.

389
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:40,977
You underestimated Lady Croft.

390
00:38:41,204 --> 00:38:45,478
I underestimated how much this orb is worth.

391
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:48,367
So many horrible diseases in the world

392
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:51,930
things that are particularly susceptible to our children

393
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:54,504
You'll never know when you'll be holding a little sheal or

394
00:38:54,505 --> 00:38:59,366
or tie by the hand with the mysterious illness in their bodies

395
00:39:00,034 --> 00:39:01,012
If you kill them,

396
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:04,429
and I'll give your orb to Lady Croft.

397
00:39:04,557 --> 00:39:08,364
My men tell me, she's a few miles away from here
as we speak.

398
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:10,740
I wonder how much she would pay

399
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:14,202
I'll pay you an additional $12 million dollars.

400
00:39:14,203 --> 00:39:17,233
It will be yours when she has delivered the orb to me

401
00:39:17,234 --> 00:39:19,702
along with Lady Croft's body.

402
00:39:19,928 --> 00:39:22,249
I don't think you know where they are.

403
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,251
You're impossible you know that.

404
00:39:23,252 --> 00:39:26,898
I think you pretended to know
so I would get you out.

405
00:39:26,899 --> 00:39:31,026
This isn't a tomb Croft,
and Shay Ling aren't mummies.

406
00:39:31,227 --> 00:39:32,494
They're killers.

407
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,580
But if you don't trust me,

408
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:42,293
I'm sorry I have to do this
but you're wasting time.

409
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,639
You want to shoot me, shoot me.

410
00:39:49,734 --> 00:39:54,027
Personally, I'd rather you do it than them.

411
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:06,635
bu xu dong (Stay right there!)

412
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,507
Well, Terry, what part of "never come back again"

413
00:40:16,908 --> 00:40:18,478
didn't you understand?

414
00:40:22,402 --> 00:40:24,080
You wanted to fight the Shay Ling.

415
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:31,497
The only way to get into their place
is as their prisoners.

416
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:34,142
You want to tell me that in jail before.

417
00:40:34,143 --> 00:40:35,003
Would you have believed me?

418
00:40:35,275 --> 00:40:38,780
Make Chen Lo a better offer than his buyer

419
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:39,820
you cross them.

420
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,313
Even if his buyer is Jonathan Reiss.

421
00:40:43,837 --> 00:40:46,055
You may have told me that lot in gem before.

422
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:32,083
Were you really going to kill me?

423
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:33,996
Oh, I bet you would have

424
00:41:35,543 --> 00:41:36,795
I've seen her in action.

425
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:38,729
Didn't Terry tell you?

426
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:41,421
The last time any of us saw him,

427
00:41:41,772 --> 00:41:43,987
he was riding away with a truck

428
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,202
full of my many vases

429
00:41:47,646 --> 00:41:53,034
and sitting next to him, was his sister

430
00:41:55,437 --> 00:41:56,337
Oh, how is she?

431
00:41:56,338 --> 00:41:57,502
You

432
00:41:57,904 --> 00:42:00,070
shouldn't come here

433
00:42:01,797 --> 00:42:02,850
They got me out of prison

434
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,417
this here lady has a good offer

435
00:42:06,184 --> 00:42:07,452
better than Reiss.

436
00:42:07,932 --> 00:42:09,159
Really?

437
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,786
Should I take it?

438
00:42:11,558 --> 00:42:12,384
Take it.

439
00:42:12,385 --> 00:42:14,366
Or better yet,

440
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:17,593
you and I run some horrendous thing
back to the British for triple.

441
00:42:20,064 --> 00:42:21,016
Let's talk.

442
00:42:22,051 --> 00:42:23,249
Not you, Terry.

443
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:26,746
Lady Croft and I.

444
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:28,145
You wait here.

445
00:42:29,725 --> 00:42:30,769
Catch up.

446
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:33,001
There will be four minute.

447
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:36,093
Terrific!

448
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:41,947
There's something I think you will have appreciated

449
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:55,924
This is the largest terracotta warriors I've found.

450
00:42:57,087 --> 00:42:59,007
The king of Qin made them

451
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,924
for use in the afterlife

452
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:04,927
to fend off enemies he may

453
00:43:04,928 --> 00:43:07,243
Sounds like we could both use it there.

454
00:43:09,123 --> 00:43:11,049
I'd be happy to sell some to you.

455
00:43:12,101 --> 00:43:14,306
I hope you're as entrepreneurial with the Orb.

456
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,116
You've lost men, I've lost men

457
00:43:18,216 --> 00:43:20,470
I see no reason we should both lose again.

458
00:43:20,471 --> 00:43:23,874
If I want double, would Reiss offer it to me?

459
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:24,331
Is it here?

460
00:43:25,007 --> 00:43:26,266
It's worth a lot.

461
00:43:26,267 --> 00:43:27,926
Well then, if you know that,

462
00:43:27,926 --> 00:43:30,633
you'll know Reiss will also kill you
the moment you give them to him.

463
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:33,409
And your government would guarantee my safety?

464
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:34,560
No.

465
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:35,930
But I will.

466
00:43:36,432 --> 00:43:40,373
That must hurt, saying that to me.

467
00:43:41,564 --> 00:43:42,695
Take the offer.

468
00:43:51,749 --> 00:43:53,438
You presume to give me orders?

469
00:43:53,836 --> 00:43:56,422
Take the offer before it expires.

470
00:43:56,423 --> 00:43:58,308
No.

471
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,427
Then I would have to force you.

472
00:44:00,528 --> 00:44:01,858
Then I would have to kill you.

473
00:45:13,894 --> 00:45:15,156
Has it been four minutes yet?

474
00:45:59,936 --> 00:46:01,288
Loverboy,

475
00:46:03,141 --> 00:46:05,273
It's too bad, you're on the wrong side

476
00:46:07,915 --> 00:46:10,974
Tell me where the orb is,
and I'll spare your life.

477
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:17,194
The Flower Pagoda in Shanghai, 9 PM.

478
00:46:21,476 --> 00:46:22,743
This is mine.

479
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,572
Now, we're even.

480
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:44,985
Freeze! Put your hands up!

481
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:10,771
Remember that no gun rule? I reconsidered.

482
00:47:43,562 --> 00:47:46,214
Lara, there was a staircase we could have used.

483
00:48:13,405 --> 00:48:14,669
Lorie, are you all right?

484
00:48:15,056 --> 00:48:17,984
rushing, I'm on my way to Shanghai

485
00:48:18,107 --> 00:48:19,722
And I need you to look at something for me.

486
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:23,367
It's in the Luna Temple near the orb.

487
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:26,220
And I'm betting it's key to those markings.

488
00:48:27,762 --> 00:48:30,471
She's holding some sort of musical instrument.

489
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:33,846
It's sound.

490
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:36,017
That's brilliant.

491
00:48:36,124 --> 00:48:38,690
Key must have linked into it some way

492
00:48:38,691 --> 00:48:40,605
I'll start decoding the images we have.

493
00:48:40,605 --> 00:48:42,585
-Good.
-You give us the rest, bye, Lara.

494
00:48:42,707 --> 00:48:43,255
-Miss you.
-Bye.

[Shanghai]

496
00:49:01,113 --> 00:49:04,162
Flower Pagoda, 8:50 pm

497
00:49:39,167 --> 00:49:42,370
Trouble is coming, let's go.

498
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:55,551
well.

499
00:49:56,282 --> 00:49:57,382
Just like old times.

500
00:50:02,495 --> 00:50:07,424
I think that's the first time you've
actually smelt because of me

501
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:15,923
Why did you do it?

502
00:50:16,653 --> 00:50:18,240
I started thinking.

503
00:50:18,241 --> 00:50:21,861
I was...tired of doing things for somebody else's way

504
00:50:21,862 --> 00:50:24,393
and it was always going to be somebody else's way.

505
00:50:24,494 --> 00:50:27,037
So you abandoned your men and
betrayed your country.

506
00:50:28,546 --> 00:50:30,467
Leaving my men and my country

507
00:50:30,468 --> 00:50:33,090
that didn't actually hurt as much as I thought.

508
00:50:34,472 --> 00:50:36,307
Believe me you would do it.

509
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,824
that hard to follow Croft.

510
00:50:47,365 --> 00:50:50,600
Do you know why you and I got
along for a while?

511
00:50:51,335 --> 00:50:51,885
No.

512
00:50:53,872 --> 00:50:56,539
We are two of a kind, me and you.

513
00:51:00,247 --> 00:51:01,908
We are nothing alike.

514
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:03,343
-I don't think we're alike.
-Um hm.

515
00:51:04,915 --> 00:51:06,502
But do you think we're a pair?

516
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:09,466
say it's the same coin.

517
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:36,882
My men have the roof covered.

518
00:51:36,883 --> 00:51:38,969
Why don't you set down at the square instead.

519
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:42,373
That way, my men would also have things covered.

520
00:51:42,488 --> 00:51:44,123
Okay, fine.

521
00:51:44,528 --> 00:51:46,357
Okay, so, let's go!

522
00:51:50,888 --> 00:51:52,779
We're arriving at the square.

523
00:51:54,698 --> 00:51:55,973
We're in the wrong position.

524
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,701
-Steels? -No time.

525
00:51:57,833 --> 00:51:59,012
-Wet tapes?
-No.

526
00:51:59,466 --> 00:52:00,547
I've got a plan!

527
00:52:01,181 --> 00:52:03,512
Stay here, wait for my signal.

528
00:52:07,953 --> 00:52:10,308
Here's your money, come and get it.

529
00:52:18,857 --> 00:52:20,405
Wait for my signal, pal.

530
00:52:20,706 --> 00:52:21,699
Give me that box!

531
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,712
You give me the money first.

532
00:52:37,594 --> 00:52:38,516
Get out of here.

533
00:53:22,002 --> 00:53:23,643
Go, run her over!

534
00:53:38,871 --> 00:53:41,288
-Yeah.
-We tried it your way,

535
00:53:41,288 --> 00:53:42,499
now we'll do it mine.

536
00:53:42,732 --> 00:53:44,879
Bring it...now.

537
00:53:45,002 --> 00:53:45,981
Okay!

538
00:54:37,494 --> 00:54:39,753
Come on, come on! Hold it up!

539
00:54:55,608 --> 00:54:57,548
Now we're going to your brother.

540
00:54:57,573 --> 00:54:58,623
We're too late.

541
00:55:01,217 --> 00:55:02,713
Lara, what are you doing?

542
00:55:14,218 --> 00:55:15,250
Take us up!

543
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:21,187
Move! Go!

544
00:55:28,344 --> 00:55:31,119
Let's go, move!

545
00:55:43,877 --> 00:55:46,003
I'm getting tired of you
pointing that thing at me.

546
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:48,781
-Are you okay?
-Never better.

547
00:55:48,782 --> 00:55:50,051
It looks like we've lost the orb.

548
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:56,219
Actually you don't think I'd go
vaulting in the thin air for nothing, do you?

549
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:57,946
I've put a tracer on the crate.

550
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:01,940
Got it!

551
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,372
Look!

552
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:08,702
Impressive!

[Hong Kong]

554
00:56:37,351 --> 00:56:41,563
Our weapons...in the middle of the city, no way.

555
00:56:41,936 --> 00:56:44,193
He must have dumped that in the crater

556
00:56:44,587 --> 00:56:45,502
No, it's here

557
00:56:47,457 --> 00:56:48,693
One of the buildings?

558
00:56:50,275 --> 00:56:50,829
No.

559
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:54,535
It's exactly where we're standing.

560
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:03,188
There's part of me that always
allow for the possibility

561
00:57:03,189 --> 00:57:05,617
that Pandora's Box was just a legend.

562
00:57:06,493 --> 00:57:08,450
But now I know it's there.

563
00:57:14,355 --> 00:57:15,461
She escaped.

564
00:57:16,362 --> 00:57:18,092
She has no idea where we are.

565
00:57:18,492 --> 00:57:19,991
We take no chances.

566
00:57:20,775 --> 00:57:24,745
Have everything we need
to manufacture an antidote transferred to the jet.

567
00:57:28,561 --> 00:57:30,991
I need an orb for two people

568
00:57:31,205 --> 00:57:33,135
Mid city, soon.

569
00:57:35,287 --> 00:57:36,515
What? Are you crazy?

570
00:57:39,484 --> 00:57:40,243
Who is that?

571
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:41,460
Piece of cake

572
00:58:49,398 --> 00:58:51,129
