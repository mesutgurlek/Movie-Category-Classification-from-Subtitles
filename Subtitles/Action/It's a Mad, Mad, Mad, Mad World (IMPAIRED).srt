00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,170
- We all went down.
- [All chattering]

165
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,047
Was he dead?

166
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,882
Was he already dead?

167
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,094
I said, "Was he already dead
when you got down here?"

168
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,472
Practically.

169
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,059
He was still alive.
Did he say anything?

170
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,106
- Did he say anything before he died?
- What about?

171
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,942
[Shouts] What do you mean, "what about?"

172
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,945
Did he say anything
or didn't he say anything?

173
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,536
- He was raving, Officer.
- Raving? What about?

174
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:53,414
Well, he said...
What he said was sort of...

175
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,916
Embarrassing.

176
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,085
What was? Come on.

177
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,588
He thought
that this fellow was his aunt.

178
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,383
- His aunt?
- Yeah. His Aunt Belle.

179
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,426
Must have had an aunt
named Aunt Belle.

180
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,095
All right!

181
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,099
Did he make any kind of statement?
Any last messages?

182
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,227
He didn't make that clear at all.

183
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,896
He didn't make anything clear.
Can we get going?

184
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,898
Just a minute.

185
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,442
I'll get your names
and where you can be reached.

186
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,153
We're on our honeymoon.
We don't know where we'll be.

187
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,572
We can't stick around.

188
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:29,701
We're due in Las Vegas.
We don't know how long we'll stay there.

189
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,204
I got a van of furniture to get to Yuma
before I get back to...

190
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,248
We stopped to see if we could help.

191
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,458
We was too late. Let us go, okay?

192
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,378
We'll hold services for him later.
We got our lives to live.

193
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,506
- We ain't had breakfast yet.
- All right.

194
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,967
I'll have to get your name, anyway.

195
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,303
Hold it.

196
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:51,472
Me?

197
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,894
- Why?
- In case the coroner wants a statement.

198
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,481
J. Russell Finch,
2790 Penrose Boulevard, Fresno.

199
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:04,319
I won't be home for a few weeks
but you can get me through my office.

200
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,988
- What'd you say?
- Where is your office?

201
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,950
Pacific Edible Seaweed Company
and it's in Fresno.

202
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,703
- You can call my secretary.
- Ambulance is on its way.

203
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,829
Yeah.

204
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,539
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

205
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,501
We'd better shift those cars.
They're on the curb.

206
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,004
That's all we can get from this group.

207
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,964
Thank you, gentlemen.

208
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,341
Thanks.

209
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,391
Well...

210
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,102
There's an unexpected twist for you.

211
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,813
They're not going to like this
down at Santa Rosita.

212
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,858
- Culpeper's going to scream.
- Yeah.

213
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,028
- We better get our story straight if...
- What story?

214
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,614
He woke up as usual.
He started driving his car.

215
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,240
He stopped for breakfast.

216
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,993
He went to the gents' room,
climbed out the back window.

217
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,956
So what? Even Culpeper can't say
we should've been in there with him.

218
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,084
What got me is the way
he went sailing out there.

219
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,463
If I have to climb much more,
I'll be laying there with him.

220
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,631
Poor soul.

221
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,467
[Man coughing]

222
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,264
[All] Uh...

223
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,226
Melville, what happened?

224
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,646
We couldn't do anything for him.
Nothing we could do. Come on.

225
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,064
[Woman] Well?

226
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,193
Uh...

227
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,071
- It was a terrible thing.
- Russell, I feel sick.

228
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,698
Take it easy. These things happen.

229
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,534
What kind of attitude is that,
"these things happen"?

230
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,787
They only happen because this country
is full of people...

231
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,748
...who, when things happen,
just say, "These things happen."

232
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,585
- And that's why they happen!
- Let's try not to get upset.

233
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,087
Come on.

234
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,464
We got to have control
of what happens to us.

235
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,342
If we left it up to you,
we'd never hear the last of it.

236
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,095
- [Woman continues]
- [Russell] You're right.

237
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:03,104
[Woman] Do you know what those half-wit
morons up in Sacramento do about it?

238
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,649
They just sit there with their big feet
up on their big desk...

239
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:11,612
...milking 15 million people of...
- Listen, I want to say something.

240
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,115
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I've got to say something.

241
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,285
- What are you looking at?
- I'm watching something.

242
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,454
Benjy, turn around, sit still.

243
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:23,249
- Play it straight.
- They're not kiddin'. They went for it.

244
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,626
Yeah? What are you going to do now?

245
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,380
I want you to tell me everything
that man told you, word for word.

246
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,465
Don't leave out anything.

247
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,508
But do you think he really meant it?

248
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:38,723
Monica, I don't know about anybody else,
but some of them believed it.

249
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,934
Like those two back there.
[Shouts] Don't look over there!

250
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,438
I know where it is. It's under a big W.
That's what he said.

251
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,899
Like a windmill or a waterfall
or something.

252
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,777
I hope it's not under a waterfall.
[Chuckles]

253
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,446
Think of something that starts with a W.

254
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,157
Wealth. Which.

255
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,409
Let's see. Where.

256
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,995
Work. That's it.
I got to work on where it is.

257
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:05,416
One thing Dr. Carroll said was Russell
was to have no undue excitement...

258
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,168
...for at least two weeks
because of his condition.

259
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,128
- But...
- That's why we came on this trip...

260
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,006
...so Russell could relax.
You should have told the police.

261
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,759
You keep saying that.
What's the police got to do with it?

262
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,096
I think the police were chasing him.
They drove up so fast.

263
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,182
Why shouldn't they've been chasing him?
He was speeding.

264
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,184
I'm only thinking
of Russell's condition.

265
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:27,855
You mean his financial condition.
That's the only condition he has.

266
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,526
Do you know why your husband
had a nervous breakdown?

267
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:36,322
It's because he has sunk $40,000,
including $15,000 of my money...

268
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,909
...into a company that makes
seaweed for people to eat.

269
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,246
Not only does nobody like it,
it costs $4 a can.

270
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,540
- Yeah, but...
- "Yeah, but," what?

271
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,708
Most people like it and I like it.

272
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,086
I'm working hard,
trying to keep the costs down.

273
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,380
You were working hard
to keep the costs down...

274
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,716
...the day you ran
into the street screaming.

275
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,137
- Mother!
- Emmeline, shut up! And you, too!

276
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,722
Maybe he was playing
a trick on everybody.

277
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,517
Did you think about that?
He might have been a practical joker.

278
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,937
Oh... Monica! Practical!

279
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,732
What kind of man is going to play a
practical joke on complete strangers...

280
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,485
...with every bone in his body broken?

281
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,738
- Watch! Watchtower!
- No.

282
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:18,948
- Wall...
- No.

283
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,867
- Walnut tree.
- No, no!

284
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,160
- Walnuts.
- No!

285
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,911
- In bags.
- No!

286
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,291
Why are we doing only 35?
Step on it! See what happens.

287
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,459
- Mother!
- They'll see what we're doing.

288
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,587
Go ahead and try it.
What've you got to lose?

289
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:35,089
Mother, he's not that good a driver.

290
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,100
- Uh-huh.
- A-ha!

291
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,477
Going to leave the big boy behind?

292
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,905
[Tires screeching]

293
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,541
What are you doing?
Why are we slowing down?

294
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,960
It's no use.
We can't lose them this way.

295
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,755
The inside of my stomach...

296
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,147
What's that idiot in the truck doing?

297
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,483
What's he doin' back there?

298
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,486
I bet he's running out of gas. Good!

299
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,453
[Man] What happened to you?

300
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,456
- Having trouble with your engine?
- Run out of gas?

301
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,877
- What, you bend your tailpipe?
- No. It was just one of my tires.

302
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,671
I thought...

303
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,549
Shucks! Okay, so I was trying to...

304
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,633
Rats.

305
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,261
This whole thing...
I think we're making a big mistake.

306
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,638
- I absolutely agree.
- So?

307
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,890
We're being silly
running around like this.

308
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,476
- Sure. We're getting nowhere.
- By george, he's right.

309
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,730
Let's do something sensible.
Let's just discuss this thing...

310
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,357
...and reason something out.
- I'm with you.

311
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,444
And we can come to some conclusion
like intelligent people.

312
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,404
- Let's do that: What he said.
- [Horn honking]

313
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,699
Yeah. That way nobody will have an
advantage on one another, right?

314
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,034
It's fair.

315
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,869
We'd better get the cars off that curve.

316
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,913
Let's not talk here, but over there.
There's plenty of room.

317
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,582
Fine, see you over there.

318
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,876
Over there.

319
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,213
You're through to Homicide.

320
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,426
Santa Rosita Police Station...

321
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,178
...Detective Division.

322
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,598
I'm connecting you now.
Santa Rosita Police Station.

323
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,600
Detective Division. Matthews.

324
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,771
No, Sheriff, the Chief isn't here.
He's a little late this morning.

325
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,273
I'll stay late after school. Who is it?

326
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,734
- Sheriff, Crockett County.
- Who?

327
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,612
- That's where the Smiler is.
- I wonder if anything happened.

328
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,365
Gertie, will you put
that call through here?

329
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,575
How about some coffee, Schwartz?

330
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,668
Hello, Sheriff. Culpeper.

331
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,879
What'd he do, make a break?
What happened?

332
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,964
Afraid I got some bad news.

333
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:07,218
- Grogan's cashed in his chips.
- He what?

334
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,429
[Man] He crashed his car
about 20 minutes ago.

335
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,681
He was making a break, all right.

336
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,435
How did it happen?
Where did it happen?

337
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:22,775
On 39, about 18 miles east
of Danby Junction.

338
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:27,154
- Nine miles west of Valley Center.
- Were there any witnesses?

339
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,865
[Man] A few people went down
to see if they could help.

340
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:33,160
- Was he killed outright?
- I don't know, but I can find out.

341
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,121
[Culpeper] Do that. See what they said.

342
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,164
Thanks very much, Sheriff.

343
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,504
Well...

344
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,507
It's a great way to start the day.

345
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,760
You wait for 15 years
to solve a really important case...

346
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,262
...and just when you...

347
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,013
[shouts]

348
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,768
It's all right, Chief.
I'll get it for you.

349
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,731
He did it again.

350
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,958
[Laughs]

351
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,335
[Culpeper] Get that fella's number!
Get his number!

352
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,880
Get that fella's number!
Get his number!

353
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,300
[Siren wailing]

354
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:35,723
[Man on radio] Item: One large furniture
van. Item: One red Volkswagen.

355
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,100
That's them. Call in.

356
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,769
2-1-6-2, 2-1-5-8.

357
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,564
We just made all four of them
parked alongside the road.

358
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,233
They're standing there talking. Over.

359
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:50,488
[Man on radio] Sammy, let that ambulance
go. And stay by the radio.

360
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:55,242
The man said there was a certain amount
of money buried in this park.

361
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,452
Under a big W.

362
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,162
What is a big W?

363
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,080
We find out, we'll send you a wire.

364
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,582
[Laughs]

365
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,044
It's only a possibility
that this man was telling the truth.

366
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:10,591
If it was the truth, then it is a fact
this place is almost 200 miles away.

367
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,052
I suggest we quietly get
into our cars...

368
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,306
...and drive down there
at a safe, sound speed...

369
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,850
...keeping in sight of each other.

370
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,812
When we get there, we dig up the money,
providing there is money...

371
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,274
...and if we do find it, we share it
amongst us in a simple manner.

372
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,068
He's got a point. He's got something.

373
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,279
- We should go straight to the police.
- The police? Why?

374
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:36,534
It's all right, she's with us.
What's this "fair shares for everybody"?

375
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:41,372
We arrived in four vehicles. I think
we should split it up in four quarters.

376
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,167
Four quarters?
What are you talking about? Quarters?

377
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,712
You mean you three each get a quarter
and we have to split a quarter?

378
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,215
- That's right.
- What are you trying to pull?

379
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,385
- Seems fair to me.
- Naturally, it's fair to you.

380
00:25:54,553 --> 00:26:00,266
- It just cheats us, that's all.
- $350,000 divided by four is...

381
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,018
[mutters]... let's say, $87,500.

382
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,687
That's what it is.

383
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:08,232
The three of you get $87,500
and Benjy and I have to split.

384
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,694
There was five of us down at the wreck.
We should split it five ways.

385
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,903
He's right. We should.

386
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,656
I'm perfectly willing to discuss it
in a five-way manner.

387
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,492
We can discuss it in a five-way manner,
five shares...

388
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,828
...each share would be $70,000...

389
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,621
$70,000?

390
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,831
Holy mackerel!

391
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:28,002
You realize how many loads
I'd have to haul from Modesto to Yuma...

392
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,587
You're overlooking one thing.

393
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,755
- We're overlooking...
- What little thing?

394
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,174
- What little thing?
- We can all count.

395
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,760
- There were eight of us.
- There were eight of us.

396
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,597
Speaking for my wife and myself,
we'd be just as happy...

397
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,309
Happy with two-eighths instead
of a quarter? Awfully big of you.

398
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,395
Wait a minute, hold it.
Put it back the way it was before.

399
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,772
Either one quarter for each car,

400
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,900
including the van,
or one fifth for each guy.

401
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:56,614
- Because this old bag has to stick...
- How dare you!

402
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:01,285
Chief, we got a situation here
that is absolutely incredible.

403
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,538
- Look, Smiler Grogan... Remember him?
- Yes.

404
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,374
Smiler Grogan spent the night here, see?

405
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,627
Made his break this morning.

406
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:14,173
He drove up this way, got to here,
crashed and killed himself.

407
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:17,718
But before he died,
some people stopped to help him.

408
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,013
They are now stopped here, talking.

409
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,224
I think they're arguing about something.

410
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:28,729
And a Crockett County unit
has got them under observation.

411
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,982
We give shares to everybody
and for everything.

412
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,068
Now, there are eight of us.

413
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,071
There's eight shares for that.
Then there were four vehicles.

414
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,407
If we give four shares for that,
that's 12 shares already.

415
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,743
There were five of us
who went down to the wreck.

416
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,411
We give five shares for that.

417
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,288
That makes it 17, right?

418
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,290
Now, 17 shares and then we add...

419
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,293
...the same number of shares
as people in each vehicle.

420
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,755
Three for your group, two for yours,
two for us, and one for you.

421
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,424
That adds up to 25 shares.

422
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:02,763
25 into 350,000 is $14,000 per share.

423
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,640
Figured like that would mean...

424
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,102
...you'd get three shares for being
three people, one for the car...

425
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,854
...one share for going down
and looking at the wreck...

426
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,482
...and three for being
three more people in the car.

427
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:18,570
A total of eight shares,
giving you $112,000.

428
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:22,157
That should cover everything,
including the emancipation of women.

429
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,450
Let's see now.

430
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,704
I got one share for being one person...

431
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,290
...one share for going down the hill,
one share for the truck...

432
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,127
...one share for being a person
in the truck.

433
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:38,757
But no matter how you figure it out, I
still don't get as much as anybody else.

434
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,051
Let me explain it once more.

435
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:46,265
Their group, they, those three of them,
they get $112,000, right?

436
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,685
Those over there, them,
they get $97,000.

437
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,312
We, us, we get $84,000.

438
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,775
And you, by yourself,
you get $56,000...

439
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:57,818
...alone.

440
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,988
- That's tax-free money.
- What do you mean, tax-free?

441
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:05,117
If we go down to this park
and we uncover the money...

442
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,995
I'm sure he's not going
to declare anything.

443
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,997
I know he's not going
to declare anything.

444
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,668
- I'm not going to declare...
- What are you talking about, declare it?

445
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,421
I mean, it's like non-taxable income.

446
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,715
It's like a gift.

447
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:23,218
If we find the money,
we still have to report the taxes.

448
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:26,180
Otherwise, it's like stealing
from the government.

449
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,515
[Mutters] You explain it to him, please.

450
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,893
Who me?

451
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,813
If we find the money,
there may not be taxes to pay on it...

452
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,523
...because we found it.

453
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:40,611
- What he was trying to say is...
- Everybody has to pay taxes.

454
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,990
Even businessmen that rob,
steal and cheat people every day...

455
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,825
...even they have to pay taxes.

456
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,621
I give up. Anybody got a better,
fairer plan, go ahead.

457
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,666
There were eight of us there,
so that simply means eight shares.

458
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,628
- Three for us, two for you...
- This is hopeless.

459
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,881
We'll get no place if we continue
listening to this old bag.

460
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:04,635
Lady, you trying to split us up
so every man's for himself?

461
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,220
And every woman for himself?

462
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,055
One more funny remark from you...

463
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,225
- Let's get out of here.
- Please, don't argue anymore.

464
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,686
We figured it 17 different ways.

465
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,064
Every time we figured it,
it was no good.

466
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,818
No matter how we figured it,
somebody didn't like it.

467
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,196
Now there's only one way to figure it.

468
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,073
And that is, every man...

469
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,867
...including the old bag, for himself!

470
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:32,079
- Good luck and may the best man win!
- Right!

471
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:36,250
Except you, lady.
May you just drop dead!

472
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,585
All right. We all agree on that.

473
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:43,757
Let's be sensible about this thing.
There's money in this for all of us.

474
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,094
There's enough for you.
There's enough for you...

475
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,805
...for me...

476
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,099
...and for you...

477
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,934
...and there's enough for...

478
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,187
Melville, my shoe!

479
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,106
Get in the car!

480
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:32,222
[Man] 2-1-5-8, 2-1-6-2, four cars under
observation are passing this checkpoint.

481
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,224
Lead car is Plymouth station wagon.

482
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,226
Next, the Ford van, the Volkswagen...

483
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,146
...and the Chrysler Imperial
convertible, all doing about 50.

484
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,356
Yep, they're on their way.

485
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,400
[Culpeper] All traveling
in the same direction?

486
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,193
Right. According to my boys...

487
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:48,238
...they're all
on reckless driving charges already.

488
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:52,993
None of those people must suspect
that anybody's interested in them.

489
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,537
Now, Sheriff,
will you get on to Capt. Hardesty...

490
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,123
...and see how many helicopters
he can let us have?

491
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,793
I'll see what we can do
and I'll call you back.

492
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,840
Now, where have I always told you
that the Smiler hid the dough?

493
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,926
- I know.
- Where?

494
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,512
- Right there.
- That's right, yeah.

495
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,515
If these merrymakers
decide to go for it...

496
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,560
...they'll go to the crossroads
and turn south.

497
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,022
But why did Smiler head east
when he made his break...

498
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,358
...if the money is down here somewhere?

499
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,734
- Oh!
- [Chuckles]

500
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:30,197
Aloysius, the guy is just being clever.
You can't...

501
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,449
5 will get you 10...

502
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,536
...they turn south at the crossroads.
- You got yourself a bet.

503
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,298
[Tires screeching]

504
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,886
"Mount Shasta National Forest."
Are we near...

505
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,681
That's on the top!
Look down near the bottom.

506
00:32:57,016 --> 00:33:00,310
- Are we near Oregon?
- That's 700 miles from here.

507
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,235
[Tires screeching]

508
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,284
Don't pass it!

[Tires screeching]

510
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,210
You'll lose your license.

511
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:33,135
We've got the Imperial
and we're running last?

512
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,303
I can't pass them on the curves.

513
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:38,098
Go on. Go ahead. Look, there's a space!

514
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,184
You waiting for an engraved invitation?

515
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,812
[Russell] Get over!

516
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,939
[Woman] Get over to the side
where you belong!

[Rattling]

520
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,913
I said it before and I'll say it again.

521
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,499
I didn't want to move to California.

522
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,804
- Did you find it yet?
- I can't find it anywhere.

523
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,514
Take the wheel. Give me the map.

524
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,557
Take the wheel! Give me the map.

525
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,977
It must be here.
Right over here. Valley Center!

526
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,270
It's right here.

527
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,022
There's an airfield not far...

528
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,858
- [both yelling]
- Get it off your face!

529
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,947
- Get it off me!
- Don't go in there!

530
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,366
Swing over! Watch out!

531
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:25,997
- Take it off.
- Get it off!

532
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,749
I've had enough.

533
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,392
- They're going to hire airplanes.
- Never mind. Go!

534
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,854
- But they'll be there hours before...
- I said never mind. Let's go!

535
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,148
Nobody's getting me up in the air.

536
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,154
[Metal rattling]

537
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:07,664
I wanted to be reasonable,
give them reasonable shares.

538
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,417
No. They wanted every man for himself.

539
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,503
I'm going to show them
what kind of man they're dealing with.

540
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,926
[Engine sputtering]

541
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,973
[Man] It's stalled, Benjy.
We got dust in the carburetor.

542
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,442
When the people who own this see this,
I sure hate to think...

543
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,736
Never mind.

544
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,904
Here's the bike.

545
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,948
Get to the nearest phone
and hire the best car you can find.

546
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:46,953
But this is a girl's bike.
This is for a little girl.

547
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,915
I've got to get this stuff back
so I can lock up the van.

548
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,834
We'll put everything away.
Will you get going? Hurry.

549
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,045
Okay.

550
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,339
I got to admit...

551
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,800
...I feel kind of silly.

552
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,719
You know what I mean?

553
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,855
Will you take us or won't you?

554
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,316
For $250, I guess I will.

555
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:20,237
You take care of the plane.
We'll leave our car here till tomorrow.

556
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,572
- I'll give you a check.
- Check?

557
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,158
Traveler's check from
the Bank of America. Don't worry.

558
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,744
- Oh, boy.
- Hey!

559
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,372
Are you a pilot?
Is there a plane around?

560
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,539
Right both times.

561
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,792
Where's an airplane? I don't see any.

562
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,835
There's only one. We've chartered it.

563
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,672
- So you and your friend...
- Did you make a deal with them?

564
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,008
- Right.
- Where can we charter another plane?

565
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,886
- Nearest place is North Valley.
- Where's that?

566
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,807
Other side of Valley Center,
about 12 miles, 15 miles.

- Excuse us.
- Filibuster, filibuster.

568
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,145
You can stick around
and watch us take off.

569
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,731
Listen, dentist. I hate dentists.

570
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:00,819
I hate you so much, I'm not able to tell
you how much in front of your wife.

571
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,737

00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,796
Good morning.

00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,965
- Good morning.
- Had an accident?

00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,926
- Anyone hurt?
- No, but we've got to get to a phone.

576
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,262
Can you give us a lift?

577
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,348
Of course, I should be
absolutely delighted.

578
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,978
Upsy-daisy. I'm afraid you
caught me on the hub there.

579
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,522
Madam, do be careful.
I have some cactus specimens...

580
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,942
- Oh!
- I'm most frightfully sorry.

581
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,904
I've been gathering some samples
of desert flora.

582
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,573
Where shall I put this?

583
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,159

00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,121
Good morning.

00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,291
It certainly is. We're in a hurry.
We've got to get to a phone.

586
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,501
Of course, with pleasure.

587
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,796
Jolly nasty accident there.
Jolly lucky nobody was hurt.

588
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:05,300
Where did you get that funny accent?
Are you from Harvard or something?

589
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,136
Harvard? Rather not. I'm English.

590
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,013
Sounds so foreign.

591
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,974
Really? I say,
we haven't introduced ourselves.

592
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,602
My name is Algernon Hawthorne...
Col. Hawthorne.

- You're a colonel?
- Lieutenant colonel, actually.

My name is Finch. This is my wife.

This is my mother-in-law, Mrs. Marcus.

Do stuff those in the back.

Cactus. It's rather a hobby of mine.

598
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,410
Spent the last 10 days
gathering some for my collection.

599
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,704
Nothing spectacular, actually.

600
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,208
Cereus echinocactus, opuntia.
That sort of thing.

00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,710
Been enjoying a spot of leave
from Vandenberg.

602
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,171
- From what?
- Vandenberg.

603
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,756
The missile place.

604
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,301
I've been attached there
for the last 10 months. Liaison work.

605
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,096
All very hush-hush and whoosh-whoosh.

606
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,472
[Laughs]

607
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,140
That sort of thing, you know.

[Chuckling]

609
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,395
Please, will you look at the road?

610
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,981
Yes. Whoosh-whoosh.

611
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,656
- Don't stop! Keep moving!
- Mother!

612
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:13,243
That big stupid lout! He ran into us.
Keep moving!

613
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,963
I won't fly in this old...
Listen to it.

614
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,923
Look at how it's shuddering.

615
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:31,052
Can't we go on our second honeymoon
and forget all about this?

616
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,514
Honey, please, darling.
Believe me, everything is all right.

617
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,891
Do you think I'd take a chance with you

618
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,977
if there was any danger
in flying this thing?

619
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,104
This plane is really built.

620
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,898
When was this plane built?

1916.

622
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:51,281
1916. These planes are tried and true.

623
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,033
There's nothing experimental
about these planes.

624
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:57,162
So, come on.
Let's have one big adventure.

625
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,706
Get up there and have some fun.
Here we go.

Are you sure you can't rent us
that truck? I'll pay.

I told you, we can't.

632
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,830
This is our first week open.
How could we do without our truck?

633
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,790
We're in business.

634
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:46,336
We'll have to speak to the Englishman.
If we tell him what happened...

635
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,046
How can you admit we're involved...

- He'll say he's entitled to a share.
- He would be if he drove us there.

If we don't tell him, he won't.

What's with the kiddy bicycle?
Are you some kind of a nut?

643

No. I had an accident.

going to believe it could've happened.

a little while back...

It involved $350,000.

It may be a little flat.
Is there an airport anyplace around?

If the spare's flat, don't fix it.
Give me a new tire.

672
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,657
You ain't got a new tire, fix the spare.

will get behind a resolution...

You can, Al.

upon the department.

Mr. Fitzgerald, listen. Please, sir.

774
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:49,336
We hate to disturb your sleep,
but it's an emergency.

775
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,464
You've no right to crash in here.

[Coughing, grunting]

That's a head cold.

778
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,928
Mr. Fitzgerald,
you know where Rosita Beach is?

779
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:01,807
- Only you can get us there.
- It's a matter of life and death.

780
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,726
Right, a matter of life and death.

781
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,645
- It's our grandmother. She's dying.
- Who's dying?

782
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,982
Our grandmother is dying
and she's sent for us.

783
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:14,487
She's in Rosita Beach.
She's dying and we're up here.

784
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,698
She'd like us with her when she goes.

785
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,825
Otherwise, she won't go.

786
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:23,329
- She'll go.
- Sir, they forced their way in here.

787
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,290
No, we didn't. Let me introduce myself.

788
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,334
I'm Dingy Bell. This is Benjy Benjamin.

789
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,170
- How do you do?
- Don't start with that!

790
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,673
Sir, we'd like you to help us out
by taking us down...

791
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,345
- What's the matter?
- Wait just a minute.

792
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,891
I can't see!
Something's happened to my eyes.

793
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,559
[Stammering] I can't see!

794
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,311
You can't see? He can't see.

795
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:51,357
- Must be an eye cold.
- George, I can't see.

796
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,860
- [George] One minute, Mr. Fitzgerald.
- I can't see! George!

Mr. Fitzgerald!

We want to make sure
he doesn't get loose.

801
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,999
I'll kill that dirty rotten bum...

802
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:12,002
...if I get my hands on him.
What's the matter?

803
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,046
How come I'm tied up like this?

804
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,549
Just sit there.
Everything will be all right.

805
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,218
Yeah. Friends are coming
to take care of you.

806
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,512
What friends?
What are you talking about?

807
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,556
Get this stuff off me. Turn me loose.

808
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,558
Take it easy. You've been sick.

809
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:29,436
Who's been sick?
And where's that bum with the glasses?

810
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,982
[Stammering] Now just sit still,
because the doctor is going...

811
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,986
What doctor? I don't know no doctor.
What are you guys, crazy or something?

812
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,822
I'm warning you.
Get this stuff off me, you understand?

813
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,992
- Get this stuff off me!
- Watch him, Ray, watch him!

814
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,996
I'm warning you!
I'm going to have to hit you again.

[Grunting]

You keep this up
and I'm going to get sore.

819
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:20,613
Okay. That's the way you want it,
that's the way you're going to get it.

- Help! He's ruining our place!
- Come on, Ray!

- Leave us alone!

I was thinking that if Reggie,
my brother-in-law...

If Reggie got hold of information
like this information...

Madam, I must say I find your attitude
somewhat less than helpful.

00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:18,428
And what's all this got to do with you,
if you don't mind telling me?

909
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:22,140
If we have quite decided
to withdraw from this affair...

my keys so that I could press on.

You keep out of this!

No!

913
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:38,323
We are not. And I'll tell you why.
Because your son, Sylvester...

...is an irresponsible, unreliable,
big loudmouth, no-good bum...

it's only because...

even to become a crook.

you'll force us to take them from you!

Here, here.

Give us those keys.

I'll get them.

- Give us those keys.

- What's wrong?

1226
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,183
[Mrs. Marcus] Can you hear me?

1227
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,101
There's a whole fortune in cash.

1228
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:37,605
You can get it before anybody else,
but you've got to hurry!

1229
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,858
What's the matter? What's going on
there? Are you all right?

1230
01:19:41,026 --> 01:19:43,694
Of course I'm all right. Sylvester!

1231
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,112
Are Russell and Emmeline with you?

1232
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:49,283
Forget about Russell.
Will you shut up and let me talk?

1233
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,827
What's going on? Where's Russell?

1234
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:53,996
Don't even mention Russell!

1235
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:57,500
- When I tell you what Russell did...
- Just tell him about the dough.

1236
01:19:57,667 --> 01:19:59,001
Keep out of this! Shut up!

1237
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,712
- [Mrs. Marcus] Don't talk. Just listen.
- What did Russell do?

1238
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,508
He assaulted me, if you wanna know!
He grabbed me beside the road.

1239
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:08,052
He and this Englishman
I don't even know!

1240
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,554
Who's with you and where are you?

1241
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:14,683
I'm with this truck driver
in Peterson's Garage in Plaster City.

1242
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:17,186
Will you shut up a minute
so I can tell you what happened?

1243
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:21,857
Listen to me close! Stay there,
'cause I'm coming to get you right now.

1244
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:22,983
Shut up and listen!

1245
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:26,862
Everything's going to be all right.
Your baby's coming to get you.

1246
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:29,240
- Sit there. Relax. Take it easy.
- [Mrs. Marcus] Sylvester!

1247
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:32,326
I'm coming.
Everything's going to be all right.

1248
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:37,581
Well?

1249
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:42,628
So he's coming here,
and I'm not to worry about a thing.

1250
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,840
Because everything
is going to be all right.

1251
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:50,719
[Shouting] Exactly like your father:
A big, stupid, muscle-headed moron!

1252
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:53,681
The burglar alarm.

1253
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:57,685
We just throw it on, people hear it,
they come, and we're out.

1254
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:00,229
Don't be frightened
if it makes a big bell noise.

1255
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:02,606
Okay? All right? Here we go.

1256
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:10,948
- I don't hear anything.
- Neither do I. There's no bell.

1257
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:17,663
Look at it. It just stands there.

1258
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:20,124
Wait a minute.

1259
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:23,836
Stand back.

1260
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:38,309
[Grunts]

1261
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:41,020
Burglar alarm!

1262
01:21:41,187 --> 01:21:43,314
The stupidest burglar in the world
could come in...

1263
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:46,233
...and walk away with everything,
and we can't even get out.

1264
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:49,153
Sheesh! [grunting]

1265
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:51,155
Come here!

1266
01:21:55,952 --> 01:21:58,787
[Shouting]

1267
01:21:58,955 --> 01:22:01,832
[Monica] Melville? Melville!

1268
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,836
Even if you do get the bell to ring
and somebody comes...

1269
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:07,922
...what about the damage?

1270
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:12,343
They're the ones who locked us in!

1271
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:16,513
This thing has got to work.

1272

No!

1274

Please, help me! I'm frying!
Ah! Please! Help me!

Uh... Don't make them
so sweet this time.

1278
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:46,919
You've had two already.
Can't you wait till we're on the ground?

1279
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,672
What are you talking about?
I'll make the next batch.

1280
01:22:49,839 --> 01:22:51,215
You take the controls.

1281
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:54,969
- I don't know how to fly an airplane.
- There's really nothing to it.

1282
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:59,431
- But Benjy can't fly!
- Nonsense. Anybody can fly a plane.

1283
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:02,893
I'll check you out.
Put your little hands on the wheel.

1284
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:05,771
That's it. Now you have it.
Now the feet on the rudder.

1285
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:07,856
There you are, feet on the rudder.

1286
01:23:08,024 --> 01:23:11,235
Who says this boy can't fly a plane?
There you go.

1287
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:13,862
I'm making an Old Fashioned
the old-fashioned way...

1288
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:16,073
...the way dear old Dad used to.

1289
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,783
What if something happens?

1290
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:21,036
What can happen
to an Old Fashioned, all right?

1291
01:23:23,206 --> 01:23:26,458
I know you don't know what to do,
so don't do nothing.

1292
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:30,754
- I won't do nothing.
- That boy's a natural-born flyer.

[Engine droning]

1294
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:44,768
Wait a minute. Benjy! Benjy!
Ease back on her!

1295
01:23:44,936 --> 01:23:46,729
- I'm easing.
- Ease back a little!

1296
01:23:46,896 --> 01:23:50,315
- I'm trying my best.
- All kidding aside...

1297
01:23:50,483 --> 01:23:53,235
I'm not kidding any longer.
It's making me...

1298
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:56,864
...nervous!
Hey! We've got an accident back here!

1299
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,615
- What happened?
- I don't know!

Oh!

1302

It's good that truck pulled over.
I can't stand this anymore.

1303
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:11,211
In the name of reason,
pull yourself together.

1304
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:12,880
You were 10 feet over the line.

- [Billie Sue] I'm at the bus station.

to my daughter and me today...

...only happened for one reason:
Because you were too stupid...

...to look where you were going,
and wrecked our car!

Just a couple blows
with the sledgehammer and we're out.

1376
01:28:39,605 --> 01:28:40,939
Ah!

1377
01:28:44,235 --> 01:28:45,319
Eh...

1378
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:00,208
Hey! Wait a minute!

1379
01:29:01,085 --> 01:29:02,627
I can't cross here!

1380
01:29:02,795 --> 01:29:06,631
You said the main road.
This is Niagara Falls.

1381
01:29:06,799 --> 01:29:09,343
All right, look. You're a little boy.

1382
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:12,804
If you want to be a big boy,
which way to the main road?

1383
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:23,065
Don't!

1384
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:25,776
It's no! The answer is no.

1385
01:29:25,943 --> 01:29:29,613
He won't back any increase in pensions.
He won't even talk about it.

1386
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:33,283
There won't be any increase in pensions.
Do you know why?

1387
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:35,202
Because they got a solid majority...

1388
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,537
...of Republicans and Democrats
who've agreed...

1389
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:39,831
...that if anything
is said about pensions,

1390
01:29:39,999 --> 01:29:41,958
they'll actually reduce your pension!

1391
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:44,836
Why? Because they know
that you personally...

1392
01:29:45,004 --> 01:29:48,715
...were more responsible than anybody
else for closing down the houses.

1393
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:51,301
Could I do anything?
Would he listen to me?

1394
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:54,888
Ha! All right.
So you're an honest cop...

1395
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,557
...and you've spent a lifetime
being an honest cop...

1396
01:29:57,725 --> 01:30:00,519
...and you've got that,
and that's all you've got!

1397
01:30:00,686 --> 01:30:02,854
It's no good saying I'm sorry.

1398
01:30:03,022 --> 01:30:06,149
I'm too angry and sick at my stomach
to be sorry.

1399
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:08,068
[Billie Sue] You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

1400
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,654
That's the trouble with this family.

1401
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:15,033
- Melville, I smell something burning.
- Ah...

1402
01:30:18,037 --> 01:30:20,330
- Oh!
- Whoa!

1403
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:23,250
We're on fire! Come over here.

1404
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:26,336
Come on. This way.
Go down. Now. Go.

1405
01:30:26,504 --> 01:30:28,004
Hurry up!

1406
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:30,132
Put it out!

1407
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:32,676
I don't know how! Get something!

1408
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:35,011
- The extinguishers.
- Get one!

1409
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,265
- What'll I do?
- Use it!

1410
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:39,975
Not on me! On the fire!

1411
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:41,518
It's too deep!

1412
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:43,019
This is a car, not a canoe!

1413
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:45,188
Come on! It's easy!

1414
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:48,567
If I don't get out of here...
Why? Why?

1415
01:30:51,821 --> 01:30:54,698
All right! Here I come!

1416
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,078
It's too deep!

1417
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:02,497
It's too deep, you little rat fink!

1418
01:31:02,665 --> 01:31:04,875
Why didn't you tell me it was...
What do I...

1419
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:07,961
Don't stand there!
Get somebody! Don't...

1420
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,005
This is no place for a convertible!

1421

[Grunting]

1422
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:14,384

Look! I'm bleeding!

1426
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:28,064
[Sobbing] Mama!
What did they do to my Mama?

1427
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:30,567

Benjy!

1430
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,341
[Ginger] It's your father's fault.

1431
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:57,093
- The whole thing is your father's fault.
- [Billie Sue] Mommy.

1432
01:31:57,261 --> 01:31:59,095
[Ginger] It's your father's fault.

1433
01:31:59,263 --> 01:32:02,098
What's the matter, Chief?
Something wrong?

1434
01:32:02,266 --> 01:32:05,268
- [Ginger] You know as well as I do...
- [Billie Sue] Listen and stop yelling!

1435
01:32:05,436 --> 01:32:06,895
[Ginger] Stop it, Billie.

1436
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:09,105
- Billie, you're not listening.
- [Billie Sue sobbing]

[Overlapping chatter]

# Well, step into the lobby

# For whatever is your hobby

01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,954
# To drink or smoke or repeat some joke

[Monica whimpering]

Now stop it. Stop it, Monica!

1444
01:32:53,317 --> 01:32:55,986
It's only two pieces of small dynamite.

1445
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:58,697
[Stammering] And they're 70 feet away
in the other room.

1446
01:32:58,864 --> 01:33:02,742
This is a strong counter.
We can't possibly get hurt from there.

1447
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:23,930
Please, go and stop it.
Stamp on it or something.

1448
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:27,267
- You know I hate explosions.
- It's perfectly all right.

1449
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:31,313
I just want to blow a small hole
in the wall, then we'll be out of here.

1450
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:45,160
Something's happened to the fuse.

1451
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:47,787
- What could possibly...
- Hold it. Sh!

1452
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:49,164
Listen.

1453
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:53,418
The fuse has gone out.
I can't hear it anymore.

1454
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:57,297
- Stay down. Don't get up.
- I just want to take a look, okay?

1455
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:03,720
Huh! Now I see.

1456
01:34:05,222 --> 01:34:07,223
It's the fire extinguisher stuff.

1457
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:10,060
The fire extinguisher stuff got
on the fuse and put it out.

1458
01:34:10,227 --> 01:34:12,479
Melville, don't go in there.
You'll be killed.

- You'll be blown to bits.

I just want to take a look!

Why do you always imagine
I can't do things for myself?

1462
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,951
Don't you think I got any sense at all?

1463

a little confidence in me?

How long I been flying?

- I know how to work it, Benjy!

It's a Twin Beech.
I saw one here this morning.

Who's got a Twin Beech?
It's that Col. Wilberforce.

He was at maintenance.
If he's still there, get him over here.

so you can take it easy.

We're making necessary preparations
to talk you down.

Rancho Conejo over.

1510
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:19,749
[Dingy] Rancho Conejo tower, listen,
we can't land this thing!

1511

We're in real trouble. Over!

You'll be perfectly all right
as long as you follow instructions.

1513

The man at the controls should
also be the man on the radio.

- Here. Put 'em on.
- No. I don't want to!

Put 'em on!

He said the fella flying
should be on this thing.

1517
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:40,895
Am I supposed to do everything?
You want me to fly, work the radio?

1518
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:43,314
What are you? The hostess?

1519
01:37:44,149 --> 01:37:46,860
No, he's got to take charge.
What's the matter with him?

1520
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:48,987
He's just sitting there, rigid-like.

1521
01:37:49,154 --> 01:37:52,532
If he catches you at that keyhole,
you'll be rigid-like.

1522
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:55,785
- He didn't want to be disturbed.
- He keeps looking at the wall.

1523
01:37:55,953 --> 01:37:58,621
He'll have to be disturbed
if any of this develops further.

1524
01:37:58,789 --> 01:38:03,084
I bet you any amount of money that
we could get on the ball and get...

1525
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:07,630
Everything's under control, Chief.

1526
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:11,801
- You okay, Chief?
- Yes. Why?

1527
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:14,345
- How's it going?
- Something's bound to happen soon.

1528
01:38:14,513 --> 01:38:15,763
Take a look at this.

1529
01:38:15,931 --> 01:38:18,308
Those two in the basement
started a fire...

1530
01:38:18,475 --> 01:38:21,144
...then set off fireworks.
They still didn't get out.

1531
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,897
Those two guys in the airplane
had an accident...

1532
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:25,481
...knocked the pilot unconscious.

1533
01:38:25,649 --> 01:38:27,984
The control tower
is trying to talk them down.

1534
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:30,153
[Both yelling]

1535
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:31,654
[Man] The others...

1536
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:34,407
Aerial report that the man,
Otto Meyer, had an accident.

1537
01:38:34,575 --> 01:38:37,076
He tried to cross a river
and he lost his car.

1538
01:38:37,244 --> 01:38:39,996
Now he's on foot,
walking back to the main road.

1539
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:43,499
This fella Pike, he's here...

1540
01:38:43,667 --> 01:38:47,629
...coming in on 94 with Mrs. Marcus
and her daughter, Mrs. Finch.

1541
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:52,842
Mr. Finch and this Algernon,
whatever his name is. The limey.

1542
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:54,844
They're about five
or six miles behind...

1543
01:38:55,012 --> 01:38:57,805
...in an Avis Chevrolet they rented
in Canyon City.

1544
01:38:57,973 --> 01:39:00,683
And this Sylvester Marcus,
the one the old lady called...

1545
01:39:00,851 --> 01:39:03,186
...he's about here going
in the other direction.

1546
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:08,441
They all ought to be meeting up
in about five minutes.

1547
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:26,167
You know what I believe I'd like?

1548
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:33,341
A chocolate fudge sundae
with whipped cream and a cherry on top.

1549
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:38,930
[Engine droning]

1550
01:39:48,565 --> 01:39:53,069
Dingy, don't let this worry you.
We're gonna get killed.

1551
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:55,363
[Man on radio] Men,
this is Col. Wilberforce speaking.

1552
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:59,242
These gentlemen here have asked me
to take charge of this situation...

1553
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:03,705
...so I immediately said
that I'd be glad to take charge of it.

1554
01:40:03,872 --> 01:40:05,748
Before I say anything else...

1555
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:08,042
I don't think he's going to
help us, Dingy.

1556
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:10,211
Yes he is, Benjy. He'll help us.

1557
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:13,589
Now, just have confidence in him.
He's a colonel. Listen to him.

1558
01:40:14,049 --> 01:40:15,466
Steady, men.

1559
01:40:15,634 --> 01:40:18,803
I'm told that neither of you
has had flying experience.

1560
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:20,763
Before I say anything else...

1561
01:40:20,931 --> 01:40:24,308
...I want to congratulate you
on having done so well...

1562
01:40:24,476 --> 01:40:26,269
...uh, so far.

1563
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:30,481
Now, first of all, men,
I'll explain what we intend to do.

1564
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:34,277
You can't land the airplane
until you've made your approach.

1565
01:40:34,445 --> 01:40:39,407
And you can't make your approach until
you've made a long slow turnaround...

1566
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:41,200
...down to the south.

1567
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:43,995
And we've got to be clear
on a few things

1568
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:46,956
before you can start
that long slow turn.

1569
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:51,836
Now, the stick that you're holding,
that is, I assume that...

1570
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:53,796
Men, are you holding that stick?

1571
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:55,882
Is somebody holding that stick? Over!

1572
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:59,427
[Benjy] What stick? The wheel.
I'm holding it.

1573
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:01,679
- [Dingy] We're both holding it.
- Good.

1574
01:41:01,847 --> 01:41:05,141
For a second there, I was afraid...
Never mind that.

1575
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:08,644
Now I'll explain the controls.
It's important that you understand that.

1576
01:41:08,812 --> 01:41:11,522
Because if you don't,
I'm afraid what might...

1577
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:13,524
[engine droning]

1578
01:41:32,503 --> 01:41:34,962
- You want a lift?
- Yes, thank you very much.

1579
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:37,173
It's nice of you to stop.

1580
01:41:37,341 --> 01:41:40,343
- I'm going as far as Santa Rosita Park.
- That's out of my way.

1581
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:41,886
- We're blocking traffic.
- We are?

1582
01:41:42,054 --> 01:41:43,179
Let's move it. Move it.

1583
01:41:58,195 --> 01:41:59,779
There we go. All right.

1584
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:03,032
You hide behind the counter.
I'll light up a fuse.

1585
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:07,411
Melville, will you just do one thing
for me before you use the dynamite?

1586
01:42:07,579 --> 01:42:10,289
Try hitting the door just once more.

1587
01:42:10,457 --> 01:42:14,544
Honey, I broke my back on that door.
That's a hard door. I mean...

1588
01:42:18,048 --> 01:42:19,799
Okay.

1589
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:22,051
Where's the sledgehammer?

1590
01:42:28,934 --> 01:42:33,437
This staircase isn't safe anymore.
The fire burned it all out.

1591
01:42:33,605 --> 01:42:34,814
Please?

1592
01:42:37,192 --> 01:42:38,526
All right.

...now let's forget about the door, huh?

01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:16,814

01:43:16,982 --> 01:43:18,983
- What?
- They've spotted us.

01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:21,194
- Who have?
- Don't stop. Keep going.

1602
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:23,404
- What is this?
- Helicopter. They've seen us.

1603
01:43:23,572 --> 01:43:24,947
What helicopter?

1604
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:30,620
- That's a police helicopter.
- They always use them.

- Who?
- Who do you think? Look...

1606

I don't want to talk about this,
but they got me hemmed in.

- Who?
- Will you shut up and listen?

1608
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:42,548
I'm going to break a rule that says
we must never reveal our true identity.

1609
01:43:42,716 --> 01:43:45,468
This is a matter of life or death,
a desperate situation.

- What is?
- Will you shut up and listen?

so if you love your country...

...if you're a patriot, you'll listen,
and listen hard.

1613

and make a call.

- You got to call Intelligence.

- What on earth...
- Now, listen!

1617

You tell 'em you heard from X-27.
You got it? X-27.

1618
01:44:05,906 --> 01:44:09,367
X-27 told you to tell them they've made
three attempts on my life today.

1619
01:44:09,534 --> 01:44:11,202
They tried to drown me.

Can you handle a gun? Now, look... Oh!

01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:50,212
Russell, if you don't pull over,
I'll kill you!

1676
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:52,381
I'm warning you,
pull over and stop.

1677
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:53,924
I said stop!

1678
01:47:54,092 --> 01:47:55,718
You asked for it.

1679
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:03,392
[All shouting]

1680
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:05,311
[Sylvester] Russell,
when I get my hands on you...

1681
01:48:06,354 --> 01:48:08,063
What are you doing?

1682
01:48:08,231 --> 01:48:09,732
- I said stop!
- Are you crazy?

1683
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,067
- We'll get killed!
- Pull over!

1684
01:48:22,454 --> 01:48:25,915
Don't you know what I mean?
I said stop that car!

1685
01:48:26,082 --> 01:48:28,626
- [All shouting]
- [Horn honking]

1686
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:34,590
When I get my hands on you, Russell,
I will kill you!

1687
01:48:36,468 --> 01:48:37,718
[Sylvester screams]

1688
01:48:53,443 --> 01:48:55,110
Are you crazy?

1689
01:48:55,278 --> 01:48:57,321
Ah!

1690
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:06,622
I've never seen anything
like this bunch.

1691
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:09,458
He ran right into them,
ran them right off the road.

1692
01:49:10,627 --> 01:49:14,296
- You guys, come on out of there!
- Fellow's absolutely beside himself.

1693
01:49:14,464 --> 01:49:16,882
- What are you trying to do?
- Let's go!

1694
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:19,510
- What did you do to my mother?
- We wouldn't do any...

1695
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:21,637
Move! Move!

1696
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:25,307
- What did you do to my mother?
- I didn't do anything! Let me explain.

1697
01:49:25,475 --> 01:49:26,809
Look here.

1698
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:29,144
She called me. She phoned me.

1699
01:49:29,312 --> 01:49:31,981
What she told me was so horrible,
I thought she'd gone nuts!

1700
01:49:32,148 --> 01:49:33,649
- It was true, wasn't it?
- It's not true.

1701
01:49:33,817 --> 01:49:36,610
Whoever told you was a liar.
It's not true.

1702
01:49:36,778 --> 01:49:39,530
- It is true!
- Now, look here!

1703
01:49:41,074 --> 01:49:43,200
Are you English? Just answer me!

1704
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:46,662
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.
Don't you like the English?

1705
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:49,039
[Screaming]

1706
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:51,417
There was an Englishman.

1707
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:54,628
She said that you and this Englishman...
I'll kill you!

1708
01:49:56,006 --> 01:49:57,673
What did you do to my Mama?

1709
01:49:57,841 --> 01:50:00,801
- Emmeline!
- Mama!

1710
01:50:00,969 --> 01:50:03,762
Why couldn't you listen?
Why couldn't you shut up...

1711
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,514
...when I was trying
to tell you to listen?

1712
01:50:05,682 --> 01:50:08,642
That chap's run absolutely amok!

1713
01:50:09,811 --> 01:50:11,353
Few minutes, we'll have 'em in position.

1714
01:50:11,521 --> 01:50:14,356
In a couple of minutes,
we'll have you in position.

1715
01:50:14,524 --> 01:50:16,900
- You're doing a great job, Colonel.
- Thank you.

1716
01:50:17,068 --> 01:50:19,528
Why not just shoot 'em down?

1717
01:50:20,113 --> 01:50:23,032
None of these people must suspect...

1718
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:26,035
...that they have ever been
under observation.

1719
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:29,204
Now, none of them have ever seen me.

1720
01:50:29,372 --> 01:50:30,914
None of them know me...

1721
01:50:31,082 --> 01:50:33,792
...so I'll be moving in alone.

1722
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:37,963
The minute I move in,
I'll give you the word.

1723
01:50:38,131 --> 01:50:40,132
And when you pass the word...

1724
01:50:41,384 --> 01:50:44,845
...I don't want to have another
policeman within miles of me.

1725
01:50:45,013 --> 01:50:46,388
- Right?
- Right.

1726
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:50,768
I, uh...

1727
01:50:50,935 --> 01:50:54,396
I won't like it
if I see another policeman.

1728
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:57,024
I give you my word.

1729
01:50:57,192 --> 01:51:00,736
I wanted to stop for you.
My wife and he wanted to stop for you.

1730
01:51:00,904 --> 01:51:03,197
Tell him how my mother-in-law
made us drive by him.

1731
01:51:03,365 --> 01:51:05,658
Anything you have to say
about your mother-in-law...

1732
01:51:05,825 --> 01:51:07,242
...you don't have to explain to me.

1733
01:51:07,410 --> 01:51:08,494
You know what I mean?

1734
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:11,622
If she were a star
of a real crummy horror movie...

1735
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:14,333
...I'd believe it.
- [Horn honking]

1736
01:51:15,085 --> 01:51:16,001
Yeah!

1737
01:51:16,169 --> 01:51:17,211
That's him!

1738
01:51:17,379 --> 01:51:20,589
If I catch you, I'll kill you!
I tell you, I'll kill you!

1739
01:51:20,757 --> 01:51:22,925
You dirty robber!

1740
01:51:23,093 --> 01:51:24,718
Someone you know?

1741
01:51:40,276 --> 01:51:42,152
I'll drive. All set?

1742
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,987
All set, Chief.

1743
01:51:44,155 --> 01:51:45,823
Culpeper, all set?

1744
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:46,907
[Man on radio] Yes, sir.

1745
01:51:47,075 --> 01:51:49,785
Airport just reported
and they're starting an approach now.

1746
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:51,078
Right.

1747
01:51:58,962 --> 01:52:01,380
What's the matter, Chief?
You forgotten something?

1748
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:06,552
No. I don't think
I've forgotten a thing.

1749
01:52:17,897 --> 01:52:22,192
Now, men, about the brakes...
You've got to know about the brakes.

1750
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:26,488
[Stammering] I'll tell you
in just a minute. Just hold it a second.

1751
01:52:26,656 --> 01:52:28,907
What the hell is with this wire?

1752
01:52:29,075 --> 01:52:31,118
Just hold it a second.

1753
01:52:31,286 --> 01:52:32,661
- [Engine droning]
- What was that?

1754
01:52:32,829 --> 01:52:33,912
Men, look.

1755
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:38,417
Be calm. This is it.
Just one minute more, it'll be all over.

1756
01:52:38,585 --> 01:52:41,128
I mean, it'll all be over.
I mean, courage, men.

1757
01:52:41,296 --> 01:52:44,339
We're all with you every second.

1758
01:52:44,507 --> 01:52:47,176
We're pulling for you
as hard as we can.

1759
01:52:47,343 --> 01:52:49,970
Now it's just hold onto
your nerves, men,

1760
01:52:50,138 --> 01:52:52,055
and not get excited
or do anything foolish.

1761
01:52:52,223 --> 01:52:54,516
But just keep calm.
That's all we'll do.

1762
01:52:54,684 --> 01:52:56,935
Keep calm. Calm, men!

1763
01:53:00,815 --> 01:53:02,524
Not that calm, you idiot!

1764

[Both screaming]

1765
01:53:07,238 --> 01:53:09,114
Pull up!

1766
01:53:22,086 --> 01:53:24,171
Now, don't worry. Just keep calm.

1767
01:53:24,339 --> 01:53:25,214
[Whistling]

1768
01:53:25,381 --> 01:53:28,050
What's this?
What's this that's coming?

1769
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:32,679
- That's good. That's cement.
- What? Wait a minute! Hold it!

1770
01:53:32,847 --> 01:53:34,890
What are you doing, Benjy?

[Screaming]

1772

- What, are you trying to scare me?
- No!

01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:44,566
Well, you did.

1774
01:53:47,028 --> 01:53:50,239
It's just a couple of sticks
of dynamite, that's all.

1775
01:53:50,406 --> 01:53:54,076
How much noise could it make?
Boom. It's all over.

1776
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:56,078
Get it over right! Get it over!

Help!

1782
01:54:07,549 --> 01:54:11,093
[Screaming] Help!
I'm the Colonel, you know!

Help! Get me down!

1785

We're not going to land
and we'll never make it.

1786
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:23,605
What do you mean, we'll never make it?
Don't freeze.

1787

Benjy, don't freeze.

1788

- Damn it, come to!
- You hit me.

We're down!

- We're on the ground.
- Hooray!

1793

It's just a noise, that's all.
It's way over there.

1794
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:55,512
Put on the brakes.

Okay. Where are they?

1796

Never mind him.
An ambulance will come.

Sure. What happened?

Excuse us. Here's your bag.

You see, the lock didn't work.

Go.

01:56:51,754 --> 01:56:54,297
What's the matter?
What happened to you? Initiation?

1831
01:56:54,465 --> 01:56:56,258
We had an accident. Hurry up!

1832
01:56:57,093 --> 01:56:59,720
[Man on radio] Benjamin and Bell stopped
at a gardener supply place

1833
01:56:59,887 --> 01:57:01,847
and bought picks and shovels.

1834
01:57:02,015 --> 01:57:04,558
Hold it, Chief.
Here's a report on the Crumps.

1835
01:57:04,726 --> 01:57:09,104
Their cab turned onto 101 moving south
toward your present position.

1836
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:13,316
Wait. The other taxi's
also turning onto 101...

1837
01:57:13,484 --> 01:57:16,528
...and they're moving north.
They're both coming your way.

1838
01:57:16,696 --> 01:57:17,779
Understood.

1839
01:57:17,947 --> 01:57:19,281
Stand by.

1840
01:57:19,449 --> 01:57:22,409
- They ought to be here any minute.
- Uh-huh.

1841
01:57:45,975 --> 01:57:47,225
Look.

1842
01:57:47,393 --> 01:57:51,104
It's the two idiots, the little one and
the one with the marbles in his mouth.

1843
01:57:51,272 --> 01:57:54,024
- It's that hokey dentist.
- Yeah.

1844
01:57:54,192 --> 01:57:55,400
Pass that cab.

1845
01:57:55,568 --> 01:57:57,235
- What's the rush?
- Whaddaya mean "rush"?

1846
01:57:57,403 --> 01:57:59,780
No rush. We're just in a hurry.

1847
01:58:08,289 --> 01:58:09,831
Culpeper.

1848
01:58:09,999 --> 01:58:11,500
Now.

1849
01:58:11,667 --> 01:58:13,502
Give the order to pull away.

1850
01:58:19,842 --> 01:58:22,219
- Come on. Hurry up.
- Shouldn't I wait around?

1851
01:58:22,386 --> 01:58:23,345
No. Here's $5.

1852
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:27,140
- What's with the pick and shovel?
- Mind your own business. Come on.

1853
01:58:28,434 --> 01:58:32,479
Hey! Hey!

1854
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:35,232
- Think anybody is here?
- Didn't see any cars.

1855
01:58:35,399 --> 01:58:37,067
Wait a minute!

1856
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:40,028
- Let's talk this over.
- I got nothing to talk about.

1857
01:58:40,196 --> 01:58:41,822
Wait a minute.

1858
01:58:41,989 --> 01:58:43,365
Think anybody else has been here?

1859
01:58:43,533 --> 01:58:45,784
- How should I know?
- Wait!

1860
01:58:45,952 --> 01:58:48,703
If you think we're the first ones here,
why not make a deal?

1861
01:58:48,871 --> 01:58:49,830
The four of us?

1862
01:58:49,997 --> 01:58:52,332
Nobody knows where to look,
so we'll look together.

1863
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:57,045
We'll find it before the others.
Incidentally, where are all the others?

1864
01:58:57,213 --> 01:59:00,882
How come you two just got here?
You had the plane.

1865
01:59:01,050 --> 01:59:04,553
Yeah... What happened to you?

1866
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:07,389
They're up to something funny,
you hear?

1867
01:59:07,557 --> 01:59:11,393
Did you see the blonde I brought,
covered in paint with her dress ripped?

1868
01:59:11,561 --> 01:59:13,103
What's that all about?

1869
01:59:13,271 --> 01:59:16,898
Yeah. And what about
the picks and shovels?

1870
01:59:25,658 --> 01:59:29,119
You run back to headquarters.
Wait till you hear from me.

1871
01:59:29,287 --> 01:59:30,412
Let me come, Chief.

1872
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:33,290
I'd like to,
but it might snarl things up.

1873
01:59:34,333 --> 01:59:36,251
Thanks for everything.

1874
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:38,211
Lots of luck, Chief.

1875

[Tires screeching]

1876
02:00:12,955 --> 02:00:15,916
Benjy! Did you see anything, pal?

1877
02:00:16,083 --> 02:00:18,501
No, but there must be
something somewhere.

1878
02:00:18,669 --> 02:00:21,338
Yeah... Hey! Hey!

1879
02:00:22,673 --> 02:00:24,299
- See anything?
- Not a thing.

1880
02:00:24,467 --> 02:00:27,636
Are you sure he didn't say
something you've forgotten?

1881
02:00:27,803 --> 02:00:31,556
He said it's buried under a big W
and that we'd see it.

1882
02:00:31,724 --> 02:00:33,975
- It's gotta be here.
- I tell you what we do.

1883
02:00:34,143 --> 02:00:36,353
You go how we came.
We'll go how you came.

1884
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:38,897
We might have missed something.
Hold it.

1885

You go the way we came...

1886
02:00:42,109 --> 02:00:44,027
That's right. Okay, let's go.

1887
02:00:51,661 --> 02:00:54,162
They're looking for something
buried under a big W.

1888
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:57,040
I heard one of them,
the stutterer, say it.

1889
02:00:57,208 --> 02:00:59,542
Yeah, I heard. But what?

1890
02:01:48,009 --> 02:01:49,217
Hey!

1891
02:01:49,385 --> 02:01:50,677
Did you see anything?

1892
02:01:50,845 --> 02:01:52,137
- No. Did you?
- Nothing.

1893
02:01:52,305 --> 02:01:54,889
That guy hid it so good,
he couldn't find it himself.

1894
02:01:55,057 --> 02:01:56,057
I think...

1895
02:02:06,235 --> 02:02:07,402
Who's he?

1896
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:10,238
- I don't know.
- But he had a shovel.

1897
02:02:10,406 --> 02:02:11,865
Maybe he's a prospector.

1898
02:02:12,033 --> 02:02:14,117
- What are you talking...
- We're wasting time.

1899
02:02:14,285 --> 02:02:16,036
Harder. We gotta look harder!

Let's look harder. Come on, let's go.

but he hasn't got a shovel.

- Yes, sir. That's his car.

- I'll get that phony.
- Somebody must've come in those cabs.

Mrs. Finch,
aren't you the teeniest bit curious?

1912

No. I'm not even curious,
just disgusted.

1913

I say, that really is a pity.
Do forgive me, I must go.

Psst!

- [Mrs. Marcus] Shut up!

I don't care what you say,
I don't think they're here yet.

1918
02:03:29,193 --> 02:03:31,820
They're here somewhere.
That means they haven't found it.

1919
02:03:31,987 --> 02:03:34,155
That's all he said? "Under a big W"?

1920
02:03:34,323 --> 02:03:36,616
Actually, I joined the party after that.

1921
02:03:36,784 --> 02:03:39,160
Yes, sir, that's what he said.
It's under a big W.

- Let's look...
- Will you shut up and follow me?

- From this morning?
- Yes.

- Who's he?
- I don't know.

- I don't know!

Mama, how many people
are mixed up in this?

1930
02:04:52,610 --> 02:04:55,278
Mama, who are they? Cabbies?

1931
02:04:55,446 --> 02:04:57,363
Mama, this thing's like a convention.

1932
02:05:34,568 --> 02:05:37,237
Is anything wrong, ma'am?
I didn't mean to startle you.

1933
02:05:37,404 --> 02:05:41,157
Who are you? Are you with the others,
the ones that are looking?

1934
02:05:41,325 --> 02:05:43,660
- I am, in a way. Aren't you?
- No.

1935
02:05:43,827 --> 02:05:46,913
I mean, I didn't want anything
to do with it right from the start.

1936
02:05:47,081 --> 02:05:48,957
And you know what?

1937
02:05:49,124 --> 02:05:53,628
I know where it is. I'm the only one,
and I wasn't even looking.

1938
02:05:53,796 --> 02:05:55,088
You know where it is?

1939
02:05:55,256 --> 02:05:57,298
Yes! What should I do?

1940
02:05:58,884 --> 02:06:00,843
Ugh!

Come on out, everyone!
This is ridiculous.

- I absolutely agree.
- Come on out.

1943

We all know we're all here.
Nobody's fooling anyone.

1944
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:09,811
So we all know. So what?

1945
02:06:09,979 --> 02:06:12,146
Don't talk to my mama
in that tone of voice!

1946
02:06:12,314 --> 02:06:13,648
- You hear?
- Shut up!

1947
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:17,694
Listen, we ain't the only ones here.
I seen four or five others.

1948
02:06:17,861 --> 02:06:19,320
Those two cab drivers.

1949

We're all here.

1952
02:06:27,538 --> 02:06:31,040
Even if somebody finds the money,
nobody gets away with it...

1953
02:06:31,208 --> 02:06:33,251
...unless everybody gets a share.

1954
02:06:33,419 --> 02:06:36,296
Let's all get sensible
and get this organized.

1955
02:06:36,463 --> 02:06:39,173
Did you all hear what Mama said?

1956
02:06:39,341 --> 02:06:41,884
- Come on, Mama.
- Now, wait a minute.

1957
02:06:42,052 --> 02:06:45,179
Did any of you see a guy with glasses...

1958
02:06:45,347 --> 02:06:47,974
...with a sneery expression on his face?

1959
02:06:48,142 --> 02:06:51,311
This guy was ugly.
I mean, like, real ugly.

1960
02:06:55,357 --> 02:06:59,902
If you help dig it up,
you can have half and I'll have half.

1961
02:07:00,070 --> 02:07:02,697
Is that okay? I mean, is that fair?

1962
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:05,742
If I have half of the money...

1963
02:07:05,909 --> 02:07:09,203
...I can go away somewhere
where nobody can find me.

1964
02:07:09,371 --> 02:07:14,375
Not Russell or my mother
or Sylvester, anybody.

1965
02:07:15,336 --> 02:07:17,587
You don't know what that'd mean.

1966
02:07:17,755 --> 02:07:19,047
If I had enough money...

1967
02:07:19,214 --> 02:07:22,592
...I might be able to live
in a convent or something.

1968
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:24,719
- In a convent?
- Uh-huh.

1969
02:07:24,887 --> 02:07:27,555
We all know we're all here.

1970
02:07:27,723 --> 02:07:30,725
It seems intelligent to me
that we should all share...

1971
02:07:30,893 --> 02:07:33,019
...in one equal share apiece, right?

1972
02:07:33,187 --> 02:07:34,228
Right. Mel was right.

1973
02:07:34,396 --> 02:07:36,939
- We all know that. Lookit...
- [clanging]

- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah. Mm-hm.

1975
02:07:39,860 --> 02:07:42,153
It's him, all right. Yeah!

1976
02:07:43,113 --> 02:07:46,240
You got this wrong.
I came to apologize.

1977
02:07:46,408 --> 02:07:49,535
Forgive and forget! I'm your friend.

1978

He's so neurotic.
Can't you do something?

1979
02:07:52,247 --> 02:07:53,039
I'll get you.

1980

Sure. Look!

It's the big W, I tell you!

It's the big W!

1986
02:08:19,775 --> 02:08:20,692
Look at this.

1987
02:08:20,859 --> 02:08:23,444
- Look at it!
- [All chattering]

1988
02:08:28,117 --> 02:08:29,909
I'm sorry, Mrs. Finch.

1989
02:08:31,328 --> 02:08:33,496
I'm afraid it's too late.

1990
02:08:33,664 --> 02:08:35,623
I think they've found it.

1991
02:08:37,167 --> 02:08:40,128
Right here all the time!
He wasn't kidding!

1992
02:08:40,295 --> 02:08:44,465
- He was telling the truth!
- Folks, isn't this great?

1993
02:08:45,134 --> 02:08:47,927
Congratulations. Well done.

1994
02:08:48,095 --> 02:08:51,639
Listen, I think the big boy
should get an extra share.

1995
02:08:51,807 --> 02:08:53,850
After all, it was he who found it.

1996
02:08:54,017 --> 02:08:57,270
Yes! I insist he gets an extra share.

1997
02:08:57,438 --> 02:08:59,731
That's right.
He deserves an extra share.

1998
02:08:59,898 --> 02:09:02,483
- Well, I...
- Let's start digging.

1999

Suppose somebody comes along.
What do we tell him?

2000
02:09:04,987 --> 02:09:07,739
We're here with
an anthropological expedition.

2001
02:09:07,906 --> 02:09:09,615
- Nah.
- We don't tell them anything!

2002
02:09:09,783 --> 02:09:12,201
We tell them to scram
or we beat their brains in.

2003
02:09:12,995 --> 02:09:14,912
It was a nice dream.

Let us do it.

02:11:00,102 --> 02:11:03,604
Wait. There's not enough room.
You're bugging me.

2017
02:11:03,772 --> 02:11:05,857
- "Bugging"?
- Cut out, cut out.

What's this "cut out" talk?

- Out, baby. Out!
- Don't call me baby.

- Will ya come on?

- What was that?

- That's it.
- Sounded like a chest.

- It's a satchel.
- Hold it up!

- It's a satchel!
- I got it.

shouldn't we find a spot of cover?

There's nobody around.

Come on. Count it out.

- What are we waiting for?
- Now wait a second!

2038
02:12:07,294 --> 02:12:11,505
Everybody's going to get something, so
no arguments. We all get equal shares!

2039
02:12:11,673 --> 02:12:12,840
He's right.

2040
02:12:13,008 --> 02:12:15,927
That's the only way to do it.
Shares for everybody.

2041
02:12:16,094 --> 02:12:18,220
Now, how many are we?

2042
02:12:18,388 --> 02:12:20,264
One, two...

2043
02:12:20,432 --> 02:12:24,727
...three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...

because now you're out.

Listen!
You can't cut me out now, you hear?

All right. Okay.

2056

I'm going straight to the police.

- The police?
- What makes you think the police...

I've never met him, Mr. Pike,
but I've come to feel that I know him.

He didn't come with us.
We thought he came with you.

[Dingy] No.

2073
02:13:52,941 --> 02:13:57,153
If he didn't come with us,
then who are you?

2074
02:13:58,030 --> 02:14:00,114
I'm Capt. Culpeper...

2075
02:14:00,282 --> 02:14:02,408
...of the Santa Rosita
Police Department.

2076
02:14:07,914 --> 02:14:10,416
- [Man] Will you come to the point?
- Yeah, I'm coming to it.

2077
02:14:10,584 --> 02:14:14,295
Point is, I have enough stuff
in my private files...

2078
02:14:14,463 --> 02:14:16,630
...stuff relating to civic building...

2079

...road contracts,
harbor and cannery projects...

2080
02:14:20,218 --> 02:14:22,970
...enough stuff to put you,
the D.A., myself...

2081
02:14:23,138 --> 02:14:27,475
...and a two-thirds majority behind bars
for the next 20 years.

2082
02:14:27,642 --> 02:14:31,645
And I give you my word, that's
exactly where everybody's going...

2083
02:14:31,813 --> 02:14:36,192
...unless things start happening now.
- [Man] Like what, for instance?

2084
02:14:36,359 --> 02:14:39,445
I want the pension
for Culpeper's grade trebled.

2085
02:14:39,613 --> 02:14:43,908
Not doubled, trebled.
I want Culpeper to retire with honor.

2086
02:14:44,076 --> 02:14:48,162
I want it on paper that
that's exactly what's going to happen.

2087
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:51,123
And I want it in my hands
in 15 minutes...

2088
02:14:51,291 --> 02:14:54,251
...or I'll have all the reporters
in town in here in 20.

2089
02:14:55,003 --> 02:14:59,256
You know the word for this, Your Honor.
It's called blackmail.

2090
02:15:17,484 --> 02:15:21,237
Sir, could you possibly see
your way clear to give us a break?

2091
02:15:21,404 --> 02:15:23,489
You kidding? Him give you a break?

2092
02:15:23,657 --> 02:15:26,450
We had a pretty rough day already.

2093
02:15:26,618 --> 02:15:30,204
We was all covered with dirt,
and we fell down in an airplane...

2094
02:15:30,372 --> 02:15:32,998
...and my grandmother's dying in Oxnard.

2095
02:15:33,166 --> 02:15:35,376
I know we don't deserve
any kindness, Captain.

2096
02:15:35,544 --> 02:15:39,505
But if you could help us,
I'm sure we'd all be inspired...

2097
02:15:39,673 --> 02:15:41,382
...to live better lives.

2098
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:43,634
Well, there is one thing.

2099
02:15:44,594 --> 02:15:46,929
I don't know
whether it would help or not.

2100
02:15:47,097 --> 02:15:51,433
But if, instead of my turning you in...

2101
02:15:51,601 --> 02:15:54,061
...you went and turned yourselves in...

2102
02:15:54,229 --> 02:15:58,065
...juries sometimes look very favorably
on things like that.

2103
02:15:58,233 --> 02:16:00,734
[Stammers] You'd let us do that?

2104
02:16:00,902 --> 02:16:03,320
What are we waiting for?
Let's turn ourselves in.

2105
02:16:03,488 --> 02:16:05,072
You must be a fine human being.

2106
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:07,992
After all, why should you worry
whether we get a break?

2107
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:11,245
Well, Mr. Meyer,
no matter what you've all done today...

2108
02:16:11,413 --> 02:16:14,582
...you're not really criminals.
- [Chuckles]

2109
02:16:14,749 --> 02:16:17,668
So if you like,
you can all hop into those two cabs...

2110
02:16:17,836 --> 02:16:20,880
...and drive over to Santa Rosita...

2111
02:16:21,047 --> 02:16:24,258
...and, uh, just walk in.

2112
02:16:24,426 --> 02:16:27,928
- [Stammers] Then let's do that.
- But, sir, we can't all fit.

2113
02:16:28,096 --> 02:16:32,391
You can't take the stolen vehicles.
Those have to stay to be picked up.

2114
02:16:32,559 --> 02:16:35,352
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go.

2115
02:16:35,520 --> 02:16:37,104
[All chattering]

2116
02:16:37,272 --> 02:16:38,939
Back in the back.

2117
02:16:42,152 --> 02:16:43,194
Drive carefully.

2118
02:16:43,361 --> 02:16:45,905
They may be the last passengers
you'll ever carry.

2119
02:16:46,072 --> 02:16:47,573
Funny. That's funny.

2120
02:16:47,741 --> 02:16:48,949
Funny, right? Funny?

2121
02:16:49,117 --> 02:16:51,952
You could be the most
comical cop I ever met.

2122
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:53,245
Yeah.

2123
02:17:20,649 --> 02:17:22,983
- Culpeper.
- [Man] Yes, sir.

2124
02:17:23,610 --> 02:17:25,945
Everything is under control here.

2125
02:17:26,112 --> 02:17:29,198
It'll take a little longer
because there was a joker in the deck...

2126
02:17:29,366 --> 02:17:31,825
...that nobody knew about. All right?

2127
02:17:31,993 --> 02:17:33,535
[Man] Yes, sir.

2128
02:17:33,703 --> 02:17:36,872
So don't make a move of any kind
until you hear from me.

2129
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:38,082
[Man] Yes, sir.

2130
02:17:44,923 --> 02:17:48,926
Listen, why does the man
want to give everybody a break?

2131
02:17:49,094 --> 02:17:52,054
- What's his angle there?
- I was wondering about that, too.

2132
02:17:52,222 --> 02:17:55,849
Something funny's going on.
How's he know what we're going to do?

2133
02:17:56,017 --> 02:17:58,477
We're in enough of a mess.
We better do what he said.

2134
02:17:58,645 --> 02:18:01,021
I'm tellin' you,
the man has got some angle.

2135
02:18:01,189 --> 02:18:02,773
Wait, wait. Hold it!

2136
02:18:02,941 --> 02:18:04,233
Can you see him?

2137
02:18:14,286 --> 02:18:17,913
- Just what does he think he's doing?
- That certainly is strange.

2138
02:18:18,081 --> 02:18:20,165
- Sure is.
- What is he doing?

2139
02:18:20,333 --> 02:18:23,544
- He's going the other way.
- Why are we standing here?

- Ah!
- Holy mackerel. Almost didn't make it.

2146
02:19:04,836 --> 02:19:07,254
No other cops around. He planned it.

2147
02:19:07,422 --> 02:19:11,300
We found the money and he was waiting
to take it away from us.

2148
02:19:11,468 --> 02:19:15,763
But if we all find the money first
and turn it in, we're all in the clear.

2149
02:19:15,930 --> 02:19:19,099
Let's just get the dough
and worry about the rest later.

2150
02:19:19,267 --> 02:19:22,561
- Look. He's slowing down.

02:21:12,589 --> 02:21:14,590
We should stop
and call the police station!

2158

You shut up!

2159

We're going to get that money.
Keep driving!

2160
02:21:19,053 --> 02:21:21,388
That woman is something else.

2161
02:21:21,556 --> 02:21:23,390
Take your foot off the brake!

2162
02:21:23,558 --> 02:21:25,058
Stop hitting me. I'm driving.

2163

- Yeah, come on, let's go!

[Man on radio] F-14 to Central.

2165

Come in. What is it?

2166
02:21:41,326 --> 02:21:42,910
[Man on radio]
There's something phony here.

2167
02:21:43,077 --> 02:21:45,954
We're on 101 by Cortez
checking a mad-dog report.

2168
02:21:46,122 --> 02:21:47,915
Orders were to maintain silence.

2169
02:21:48,082 --> 02:21:50,375
Capt. Culpeper wants
this channel kept clear.

2170
02:21:50,543 --> 02:21:52,252
[Man on radio] We know it,
but we saw Capt. Culpeper.

2171
02:21:52,420 --> 02:21:55,464
He just went by doing 90 miles an hour.

2172
02:21:56,341 --> 02:21:58,634
I don't think I understand that.

2173
02:21:59,260 --> 02:22:01,094
Are you sure it was Capt. Culpeper?

2174
02:22:01,262 --> 02:22:03,263
- [Man on radio] Yep.
- Was he chasing anybody?

2175
02:22:03,431 --> 02:22:05,974
- [Man on radio] Nope.
- Could he have been chasing anybody?

2176

[Man on radio] Not a chance.
That's what struck us so funny.

02:22:09,354 --> 02:22:12,397
There were about 15 people
in two cabs behind him.

02:22:12,565 --> 02:22:14,441
It looked like they were chasing him.

They were chasing him?
What's going on here?

02:34:35,641 --> 02:34:38,810
You know, even for a policeman...

2293
02:34:38,978 --> 02:34:42,105
...your behavior was ruddy outrageous.

2294
02:34:42,273 --> 02:34:44,899
You could've taken a fair share
like the rest of us...

2295
02:34:45,067 --> 02:34:49,320
...but no, you had to grab up
the whole scene, baby.

2296
02:34:49,488 --> 02:34:54,784
We had $350,000 right in our hands.

2297
02:34:54,952 --> 02:34:58,496
Fourteen into $350,000...

2298
02:34:58,664 --> 02:35:01,040
- [all groaning]
- Shut up.

2299
02:35:03,210 --> 02:35:06,045
I wish I knew what
they were gonna do to us.

2300
02:35:06,213 --> 02:35:11,509
But no matter what happens to us, I hope
what happens to you will be worse.

2301
02:35:13,721 --> 02:35:16,889
I don't think you have to worry
too much about that.

2302
02:35:17,057 --> 02:35:19,017
My wife is divorcing me.

2303
02:35:20,060 --> 02:35:22,812
My mother-in-law
is suing me for damages.

2304
02:35:24,106 --> 02:35:27,734
My daughter is applying to the courts
to have her name changed.

2305
02:35:28,861 --> 02:35:30,903
My pension has been revoked.

2306
02:35:31,071 --> 02:35:34,699
And the only reason
that you 10 idiots...

2307
02:35:35,534 --> 02:35:38,911
...will very likely get off lightly...

2308
02:35:39,079 --> 02:35:43,333
...is because the judge will have
me up there to throw the book at.

2309
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:45,960
Aw, that's tough. Oh!

2310
02:35:46,128 --> 02:35:48,629
[Chuckles]

2311
02:35:49,757 --> 02:35:54,510
I'd like to think that sometime,
maybe 10 or 20 years from now...

2312
02:35:55,679 --> 02:35:58,890
...there'd be something
I could laugh at, anything.

2313
02:36:08,776 --> 02:36:12,236
Now, see here, you idiots,
it's all your fault because...

2314
02:36:12,404 --> 02:36:14,197
Oh!

2315
02:36:14,365 --> 02:36:18,451
- Mama!
- [All laughing]

2316
02:36:26,293 --> 02:36:28,461
Get away from me!

2317
02:36:28,629 --> 02:36:29,921
Let me go!

2318
02:36:34,426 --> 02:36:36,844
[All continue laughing]

2319
02:36:55,239 --> 02:37:00,493
[Chorus vocalizing] # Mad

2320
02:37:00,661 --> 02:37:02,328
# World #

2321
02:37:05,749 --> 02:37:08,501
[instrumental theme song plays]
