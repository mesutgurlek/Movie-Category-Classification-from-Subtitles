Hey, can we go one more game before...

You're the guy who beat up my dad.

Big difference. But don't worry.

Yeah. Sad, isn't it?

So, um, how much would you charge

489

You know, the thing about
keeping your mouth closed is

00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,081
it prevents you from speaking.

This is Amelia's protest group.

She's in there somewhere, so have at it.

She started it.

Yeah, but she's holed up
somewhere hiding.

- Amelia?

Any of you know why you're protesting?

Okay.

Evening. What can I get you?

1284
01:05:08,068 --> 01:05:10,987
HOLLAND: Information.
Have you seen this girl?

1285
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:13,306
She probably came in in the last half hour.

Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
That's why I'm asking you.

Hmm. Memory gets

Oh, not for me.

HOLLAND: He makes
a strong argument, though.

1314
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:09,673
You see? Reasonable. Very reasonable.

1315
01:06:09,792 --> 01:06:10,990
Now, your buddy,

1316
01:06:11,113 --> 01:06:12,791
that was the problem, he wasn't reasonable.

1317

- Our buddy?
- Yeah, we don't have friends.

he wasn't with you?

1319
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:19,193
Where'd he go?

1320
01:06:19,312 --> 01:06:20,871
Got in the elevator
right before you guys came in.

1321
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:24,273
- Did you get a name?
- John something.

1322
01:06:24,392 --> 01:06:25,913
Did you actually witness him
getting into the elevator?

1323
01:06:26,032 --> 01:06:28,233
No, it was told to me
by a wise old Indian.

1324
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:30,471
Of course I fucking witnessed it.

1325

- Right.
- What the hell's going on?

1326

Oh, it just makes sense.

- It connects up.
- What makes sense?

1328
01:06:34,834 --> 01:06:38,071
John Boy. Oh, just something
that Blueface mentioned, yeah.

1329
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:39,634
What do you mean, he mentioned?

1330
01:06:39,753 --> 01:06:40,713
Mentioned how?

1331
01:06:40,832 --> 01:06:42,234
Oh, you know, he...

1332
01:06:42,353 --> 01:06:43,632
"There's a guy coming to kill you."

1333
01:06:43,755 --> 01:06:46,074
That kind of crap. Yeah.

1334
01:06:46,593 --> 01:06:48,632
We should probably just stay here.

1335
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:49,914
Smart move.

1336
01:06:52,073 --> 01:06:54,795
Unless, of course, he's up
there killing her right now.

1337
01:06:54,914 --> 01:06:57,314
Nobody's getting killed
at the Burbank Airport Hotel.

Because?

1339
01:06:59,073 --> 01:07:01,274
- That would be national news.
- Yeah, so?

1340
01:07:01,393 --> 01:07:03,155
Oh, so when's the last time
you were on national news?

1341
01:07:03,274 --> 01:07:04,672
- February.
- Really?

1342
01:07:04,795 --> 01:07:06,316
- Yeah.
- For what?

1343
01:07:06,435 --> 01:07:09,154
- I got shot, in a diner.
- Where?

1344
01:07:09,273 --> 01:07:11,673
In my arm. I told you this last night.

1345
01:07:12,714 --> 01:07:15,075
- We should call the cops.
- No. It'll take too long.

01:07:15,195 --> 01:07:16,193
I mean, she could die.

1347
01:07:16,316 --> 01:07:18,635
You just said it was the right
move to stay down here.

No, I said smart move. Different.

They have memos proving that
Detroit conspired to suppress the converter,

1434
01:11:34,409 --> 01:11:35,407
proving they would rather

1435
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:37,250
poison our air than spend
a little bit of money.

1436
01:11:37,369 --> 01:11:38,767
But my mom, she's gonna say
that's not enough.

1437
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:41,528
She's gonna lie because...
Because she's on the take.

1438
01:11:41,647 --> 01:11:43,890
Money again, right?
Mammon, that's her god.

1439
01:11:44,009 --> 01:11:46,010
That fascist crony...

1440
01:11:46,129 --> 01:11:47,170
- Okay, okay.
- ...bogart!

1441
01:11:47,289 --> 01:11:49,689
All right, all right, just...
Just back up a little bit.

1442
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:51,129
(SIGHS)

1443
01:11:51,329 --> 01:11:52,488
Why not just go straight to the police?

1444
01:11:52,611 --> 01:11:54,289
(LAUGHING) She is the police.

1445
01:11:54,408 --> 01:11:56,451
She's the head of the Justice Department.

1446
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:58,890
- You... You've got a point.
- Okay, or the newspaper?

1447
01:11:59,009 --> 01:12:00,449
They all work together.

1448
01:12:00,572 --> 01:12:02,530
God, have you been living under a rock?

1449
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:05,372
All right, so then your solution

1450
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:07,530
- was you make a porn film.
- (SIGHS)

1451
01:12:07,649 --> 01:12:08,771
It's not a porno!

1452
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:10,172
HOLLAND: You know, I have neighbours.

1453
01:12:10,292 --> 01:12:11,889
- I made a statement.
- JACKSON: Right.

1454
01:12:12,012 --> 01:12:15,050
And yeah, yeah,
my statement contained nudity.

1455
01:12:15,172 --> 01:12:16,209
- Porno nudity.
- AMELIA: Art.

1456
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,732
That's just the commercial element, okay?

1457
01:12:18,851 --> 01:12:21,010
Okay? Sid said we had to have that.

1458
01:12:21,132 --> 01:12:23,333
And the reality was
we were getting our message out there.

1459
01:12:23,452 --> 01:12:25,491
And... And it was all in the film,

1460
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:27,692
names and dates and everything,

1461
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:28,894
everything that my mom was doing,

1462
01:12:29,013 --> 01:12:30,971
and once it was out there,
once it was in theatres,

1463
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:32,050
there's no way that
they could suppress it.

1464
01:12:32,173 --> 01:12:34,892
There's no way that they could cover it up.

1465
01:12:35,011 --> 01:12:36,451
HOLLAND: So let me get this straight.

1466
01:12:36,574 --> 01:12:39,212
You made a porno film
where the point was the plot?

1467
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:40,852
(SIGHS) What's your hang-up, man?

1468
01:12:40,971 --> 01:12:42,254
JACKSON: It's not the sex.

1469
01:12:42,373 --> 01:12:44,531
It's... It's what's in the story.

1470
01:12:44,654 --> 01:12:46,693
My mom found out.

1471
01:12:48,252 --> 01:12:49,331
(SIGHS)

1472
01:12:49,492 --> 01:12:51,812
She killed Dean and destroyed the film.

1473
01:12:51,935 --> 01:12:54,535
- Your mom killed Dean?
- Of course.

1474
01:12:55,932 --> 01:12:58,932
- She killed Misty, too.
- And Sid Shattuck?

1475
01:13:00,414 --> 01:13:01,535
Yeah.

1476
01:13:01,654 --> 01:13:02,895
Okay, so it's like Jack the Ripper

1477
01:13:03,014 --> 01:13:05,015
and then your mom, basically.

1478
01:13:05,134 --> 01:13:06,132
(SIGHS)

1479
01:13:06,535 --> 01:13:08,855
- So what are you gonna do?
- AMELIA: I don't know.

1480
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:12,695
I'm just really tired, you know.

1481
01:13:13,812 --> 01:13:16,454
Uh, all right, okay. So, uh, you...

1482
01:13:16,574 --> 01:13:19,895
We're just gonna talk about it and
we'll think and you get some rest.

1483
01:13:20,014 --> 01:13:21,535
Yeah, just get some rest.

1484
01:13:27,134 --> 01:13:28,494
What do you think?

1485
01:13:28,616 --> 01:13:31,093
- I like her.
- I like her dress.

1486
01:13:31,216 --> 01:13:32,814
It's a nice dress.

1487
01:13:32,937 --> 01:13:34,857
But she's a loon.

1488
01:13:34,976 --> 01:13:36,497
According to her,
her mother's single-handedly

1489
01:13:36,616 --> 01:13:38,935
gonna wipe out all of Western society.

1490
01:13:39,054 --> 01:13:40,897
Well, yeah.

1491
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:44,976
However, there are people
trying to kill her, right?

1492
01:13:45,095 --> 01:13:47,215
- Like John Boy.
- Who's John Boy?

1493
01:13:47,337 --> 01:13:50,498
- He's on <i>The Waltons.</i>
- No, different John Boy.

1494
01:13:50,617 --> 01:13:53,578
- Well, we think.
- Think, yeah. Pretty sure.

1495
01:13:53,697 --> 01:13:55,897
- (TELEPHONE RINGING)
- Can't be sure, though. Yeah.

1496
01:13:56,457 --> 01:13:59,979
Mr March, I just got a call from Judith.

1497
01:14:00,098 --> 01:14:01,899
She didn't explain herself.

1498
01:14:02,018 --> 01:14:04,898
Said she needed $100,000 in cash.

1499
01:14:05,017 --> 01:14:07,061
- $100,000? Why?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

1500
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,100
<i>I think she's involved</i>

1501
01:14:09,219 --> 01:14:10,379
in something shady maybe.

1502
01:14:10,498 --> 01:14:12,541
Well, her daughter
certainly seems to think so.

1503
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,699
What, Amelia? You found Amelia?

1504
01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:15,740
<i>Yes.</i>

1505
01:14:15,859 --> 01:14:17,660
She fell on our car.

1506
01:14:17,779 --> 01:14:19,580
We were just talking and she fell on our car.

1507
01:14:19,699 --> 01:14:21,220
Anyway, she's here.
You should come over.

1508
01:14:21,339 --> 01:14:23,582
I... I'll send the family doctor.

1509
01:14:24,062 --> 01:14:25,222
(SIGHS)

1510
01:14:25,341 --> 01:14:26,263
Okay, look,

1511
01:14:26,382 --> 01:14:28,582
<i>- Mr March...</i>
- Holland, please.

1512
01:14:28,702 --> 01:14:30,821
<i>I've got a bad feeling about this.</i>

1513
01:14:30,941 --> 01:14:35,461
Would you be willing
to carry the money for me?

1514
01:14:42,785 --> 01:14:45,784
I wish I knew who to believe on this one.

1515
01:14:45,903 --> 01:14:47,942
Well, the kid's a write-off,
I'll tell you that much.

1516
01:14:50,343 --> 01:14:51,906
Maybe they're both telling the truth.

1517
01:14:52,025 --> 01:14:53,945
We're downstairs.

1518
01:14:54,943 --> 01:14:56,065
She's coming down.

1519
01:14:58,304 --> 01:14:59,786
What do you mean,
they're both telling the truth?

1520
01:14:59,905 --> 01:15:01,027
What the fuck does that mean?

1521
01:15:01,146 --> 01:15:03,465
I got a friend, right?

1522
01:15:03,584 --> 01:15:05,466
Secret Service. Worked the Nixon detail.

1523
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:07,986
This was after they threw him out of office.

1524
01:15:08,988 --> 01:15:10,148
No. Anyway, you know,

1525
01:15:10,267 --> 01:15:12,187
Nixon's driving around one day
around San Clemente.

1526
01:15:12,306 --> 01:15:14,587
- Just him and a few agents.
- Yeah.

1527
01:15:14,706 --> 01:15:16,707
And they come across
this car accident, right?

1528
01:15:16,826 --> 01:15:19,108
There's a guy pinned under a car.

1529
01:15:19,227 --> 01:15:23,228
Anyway, Nixon gets out,
runs over to check on the guy,

1530
01:15:23,348 --> 01:15:25,149
you know, leans down,
and Nixon says to him,

1531
01:15:25,268 --> 01:15:28,471
"You're gonna be okay, son.
You're gonna be all right."

1532
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:31,109
And right then the guy dies.

1533
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:34,988
I don't get it.

1534
01:15:35,111 --> 01:15:37,388
Think about it from that guy's
point of view, okay?

1535
01:15:37,511 --> 01:15:38,471
The guy who died.

1536
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:39,670
He's lying there on the ground,

1537
01:15:39,789 --> 01:15:41,509
staring up at the sky, near death,

1538
01:15:41,632 --> 01:15:43,752
and then former president
Richard Nixon appears before him

1539
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:44,912
and tells him he's gonna be fine.

1540
01:15:45,031 --> 01:15:47,873
Now, did he think that's normal, right,

1541
01:15:47,992 --> 01:15:50,630
that before they die, everybody sees Nixon?

1542
01:15:50,753 --> 01:15:52,550
You're expecting an angel and you get Nixon.

1543
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,152
- Exactly. Right?
- Yeah.

1544
01:15:54,271 --> 01:15:56,994
It's the same situation,
just a vastly different point of view.

1545
01:15:57,113 --> 01:15:58,353
So there's two ways to look at something.

1546
01:15:58,472 --> 01:15:59,394
Yeah.

1547
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:00,554
That's the point of the story?

1548
01:16:00,673 --> 01:16:01,595
- Yeah.
- Yeah, just say that.

1549
01:16:01,714 --> 01:16:02,632
What?

1550
01:16:02,755 --> 01:16:04,832
Well, you just lead me on this
epic fucking journey with this story,

1551
01:16:04,955 --> 01:16:07,555
and 10 minutes later, the point is
that there's two ways to look at something.

1552
01:16:07,674 --> 01:16:09,314
Just... You could just say that.

1553
01:16:09,433 --> 01:16:10,593
You didn't like that story?

1554
01:16:12,993 --> 01:16:14,514
- That would be awful.
- Wouldn't it, right?

1555
01:16:14,633 --> 01:16:16,315
- Yeah.
- It would suck, right?

1556
01:16:16,434 --> 01:16:17,794
- Oh.
- HOLLAND: Hey.

1557
01:16:17,917 --> 01:16:19,077
Thank God.

1558
01:16:19,196 --> 01:16:21,915
$100,000. Packed it myself.

1559
01:16:22,034 --> 01:16:23,835
Just...

1560
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:27,837
It's not common you find
such nice people in the world.

1561
01:16:28,274 --> 01:16:29,438
(LAUGHS)

1562
01:16:31,155 --> 01:16:32,196
I'm sorry about him.

1563
01:16:32,318 --> 01:16:34,196
He just wanted to come along.
I don't know why.

1564
01:16:34,315 --> 01:16:37,557
But I'll call you, you know,
when we make the drop.

1565
01:16:39,277 --> 01:16:40,598
Thank you.

1566
01:16:44,116 --> 01:16:45,357
HOLLAND: Are you nervous at all?

1567
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:48,798
Me? No. I got insurance.

1568
01:16:48,917 --> 01:16:52,201
- This baby right here.
- Is that an ankle gun?

1569
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,400
- That is an ankle gun, yeah.
- That's pretty sweet.

1570
01:16:55,519 --> 01:16:56,440
Uh-huh.

1571
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,401
I'm falling asleep at the wheel here, man.

1572
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,519
I'm gonna need you to drive.

1573
01:17:00,642 --> 01:17:02,919
I'm gonna pull over up here.

1574
01:17:03,879 --> 01:17:06,322
You don't have to pull over.
The car can drive itself.

1575
01:17:07,121 --> 01:17:08,480
What?

1576
01:17:08,922 --> 01:17:11,042
Just take your hands off the wheel, man.

1577
01:17:21,883 --> 01:17:22,844
Hmm.

1578
01:17:25,881 --> 01:17:27,802
I didn't know it could do that.

1579
01:17:28,604 --> 01:17:30,525
Where you been, man?

1580
01:17:32,203 --> 01:17:34,123
Every car can do this.

1581
01:17:34,246 --> 01:17:36,366
Yeah, March, where the fuck
have you been, man?

1582
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:37,806
Idiot. You didn't know that?

1583
01:17:39,365 --> 01:17:41,243
You fly everywhere. You don't even drive.

1584
01:17:41,366 --> 01:17:42,326
What do you know?

1585
01:17:42,445 --> 01:17:43,966
He's got a point there, Bumble.

1586
01:17:44,085 --> 01:17:45,725
Yeah, whatever.

1587
01:17:45,844 --> 01:17:47,046

World's worst detective, huh?

1748
01:28:06,402 --> 01:28:07,842
You did see your niece, Mrs Glenn.

1749
01:28:07,961 --> 01:28:11,483
You saw her on that wall,
at a desk, in a pinstriped suit.

1750
01:28:11,602 --> 01:28:14,682
So what she saw was a movie?

1751
01:28:14,801 --> 01:28:16,683
Not a movie. The movie.

1752
01:28:17,482 --> 01:28:20,043
- The movie.
- But the film burned up.

1753
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:23,765
Well, how did she see it
two days after it supposedly burned up?

1754
01:28:23,884 --> 01:28:25,685
And the wardrobe matches perfectly.

1755
01:28:25,804 --> 01:28:28,684
So Amelia had a second print?
She had a copy?

1756
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:30,205
Wouldn't you?

1757
01:28:30,324 --> 01:28:32,444
And she gave that copy to Misty.

1758
01:28:33,404 --> 01:28:34,526
So she comes here,

1759
01:28:34,645 --> 01:28:36,285
checks the film against that wall...

1760
01:28:36,404 --> 01:28:38,166
Lily sees it through that window.

1761
01:28:38,285 --> 01:28:40,644
And Amelia splits and takes the film.

1762
01:28:40,766 --> 01:28:42,967
And goes where?

1763
01:28:43,086 --> 01:28:44,565
Oh, for fuck...

1764
01:28:44,684 --> 01:28:45,767
I mean, can't we get to the next...

1767
01:28:51,646 --> 01:28:54,008
She was screening it for the distributors.

1768
01:28:54,726 --> 01:28:56,128
She was showing them the film.

1769
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:57,568
It's out there. The film exists.

01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:31,842
Yeah. I feel great.

2062
01:45:33,002 --> 01:45:36,003
- You know, nobody got hurt.
- A few people got hurt.

2063
01:45:36,126 --> 01:45:37,363
I'm saying I think they died quickly, though,

2064
01:45:37,486 --> 01:45:38,726
so I don't think that they got hurt.

2065
01:45:39,725 --> 01:45:41,446
Look at this.

2066
01:45:44,366 --> 01:45:47,009
- I'm sorry you look Filipino.
- I do.

2067
01:45:47,128 --> 01:45:48,811
Or I look Mexican.

2068
01:45:48,930 --> 01:45:51,331
HOLLAND: And we already got our first case.

2069
01:45:51,531 --> 01:45:53,133
- Old lady in Glendale.
- Mmm-hmm.

2070
01:45:53,252 --> 01:45:54,893
Thinks her husband's
sleeping with Lynda Carter.

2071
01:45:55,012 --> 01:45:56,495
Wonder Woman?

2072
01:45:56,614 --> 01:45:58,216
Or Lynda Carter.

2073
01:45:58,335 --> 01:45:59,656
That's what we have to figure out.

2074
01:45:59,775 --> 01:46:00,694
Right.

2075
01:46:00,816 --> 01:46:03,294
But he's 82, so it's time-sensitive.

2076
01:46:03,417 --> 01:46:04,578
- What do you say?
- (BUZZING)

2077
01:46:05,619 --> 01:46:06,617
Shit.

2078
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:09,299
(CLEARS THROAT)

2079
01:46:10,659 --> 01:46:13,179
- To the birds.
- Hallelujah.

2080
01:46:14,101 --> 01:46:15,861
