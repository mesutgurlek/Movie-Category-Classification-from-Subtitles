00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,760
it would mean that Kraven
is in league with him.

323
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,386
What's so pressing?

324
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,763
Take a look.

00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,576

[OVER SPEAKERS]
I want to speak with Selene!

327
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,292
Is that Michael?

328
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,710
Is it Michael?

329
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,378
What the hell is going on?

330
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,838
What's happening to me?

331
00:52:57,924 --> 00:52:58,966
I'm coming out.

332
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:04,555
If you go to him, you'll never
be welcome in this house again.

333
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,936
Now that Viktor's awake, we'll see
what he has to say about that.

334
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,451
Get in.

335
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:54,480
Look, I warned her.
I warned her,
but she didn't listen.

336
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,315
She never listens.
I should've told you sooner.

337
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,942
Told me what?

338
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,821
Her human, Michael...

339
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,492
he's not a human at all.

340
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,826
He's a Lycan.

341

MAN:
What's this ruckus?

343

You can never come here again.

Why? Who are you people?

Whether you like it or not,
you're in the middle of a war

347
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,987
that's been raging
for the better part of 1000 years.

348
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,240
A blood feud between
Vampires and Lycans.

349
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,076
Werewolves.

350
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,466
Consider yourself lucky.

351
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,886
Most humans die within an hour
of being bitten by an immortal.

352
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,929
The viruses we transmit
are deadly.

353
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:54,350
And if you bit me, what,
I'd become a Vampire instead?

354
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,851
No, you'd die.

355
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:00,064
No one's ever survived
a bite from both species.

356
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,775
By rights, I'd stop the car
and kill you myself--

357
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,068
Then why are you helping me?

358
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:07,446
I'm not!
I track down and kill your kind.

359
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:11,283
My only interest is finding out
why Lucian wants you so badly.

360
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,623
Do you know why I've
been awakened, servant?

361
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,625
No, my lord.

362

But I'll soon find out.

You mean when you find her.

00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,922
Yes, my lord.

00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,132
You must let her come to me.

We have much to discuss,
Selene and I.

She has shown me
a great many disturbing things.

368
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:42,481
Things that will be dealt with
soon enough.

369
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:46,610
This coven has grown weak,
decadent.

370
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:51,240
Perhaps I should have left someone
else in charge of my affairs.

There's no sense of time.

Please, my lord,
let me summon assistance.

You're in need of rest.

378
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,848
I've rested enough.

379
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,810
What you will do
is summon Marcus.

But he still slumbers, my lord.

Wait.

I'm seeing these things,
these hallucinations.

393
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,331
SELENE:
They're not hallucinations,
they're memories.

00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:08,293
You've been bitten. His memories
have been passed to you.

395

This is one of the places we use
for interrogations. It should be safe.

First there was synthetic plasma,
now this.

Once it's approved,
it should be our newest cash crop.

00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,703
It's cloned blood.

What are these for?

402
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,880
Lycans are allergic to silver.

If we don't get our bullets out quickly,
they die during questioning.

What do you do with them after?

The war had spilled into our house.

the Lycans for days.

I realized that part of the engine

I think she was in shock
because she just

You know, if I knew then what
I know now, I could have saved her.

There's no doubt in my mind
about that.

about two minutes before
the ambulance arrived.

01:58:26,224 --> 01:58:28,934
I loved my daughter!

812
01:58:31,229 --> 01:58:33,605
But the abomination growing
in her womb

813
01:58:33,773 --> 01:58:36,483
was a betrayal of me
and of the coven!

814
01:58:41,656 --> 01:58:45,492
I did what was necessary
to protect the species,

815
01:58:45,660 --> 01:58:49,079
as I am forced to do yet again.

816
01:58:53,126 --> 01:58:55,210
No!

[ROARS]

818
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:49,175
Time to die.

SELENE:
Though I cannot predict the future,

821
02:05:11,962 --> 02:05:15,548
the consequences of tonight
will reverberate through the halls

822
02:05:15,716 --> 02:05:18,843
of both great covens
for many years to come.

823
02:05:20,304 --> 02:05:23,097
Two Vampire elders
have been slain,

824
02:05:23,265 --> 02:05:25,517
one by my own hand.

825
02:05:27,269 --> 02:05:31,105
Soon, Marcus will take the throne.

826
02:05:32,358 --> 02:05:36,945
And a tide of anger and retribution
will spill out into the night.

827
02:05:38,697 --> 02:05:41,366
Differences will be set aside.

828
02:05:41,951 --> 02:05:44,285
Allegiances will be made.

829
02:05:44,828 --> 02:05:46,412
And soon...

830
02:05:46,580 --> 02:05:49,249
I will become the hunted.

02:05:55,339 --> 02:05:58,466
