in a civilised manner.

or some point you were trying to make.

111
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:25,024
- Where's Verona?
- I'm not affiliated with Ricky Verona.

Don't try to fucking!

114

Easy. All right? Look, clearly
you're operating under false pretences.

115
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:38,580
Ricky Verona and myself
did not pull the Anselmo job.

116

fucked me on the Anselmo job.

117
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:45,141
In fact, Ricky Verona
still owes me $7500.

- Not how I heard it.
- That's the way it is.

119
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,543

122
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:01,660

That's what I'm talking about.

125
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:16,141
Just get me some coke, OK?
You got any coke?

126
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:19,742
- So now you're just gonna insult me?
- Come on! I don't have time!

127
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:23,427
Just give me something.

128
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:26,021
- I'm really dying here.
- I can see that.

129
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:28,496
You don't understand.
I'm really fucking dying.

130
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,226
You saying this is medicinal-use coke?

131
00:10:31,307 --> 00:10:33,298
That's right.

132
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:39,347
Well?

133
00:10:39,427 --> 00:10:43,102
- What?
- The shit ain't free, nigger.

134
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,658
That's enough.

135
00:10:57,507 --> 00:11:02,820

00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:09,104
(yelling and smashing glass)

155
00:12:24,587 --> 00:12:26,578
(phone rings)

156
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:32,376
- Doc?
- What' up, Doc?

157
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:36,457
- Fucking motherfucker.
- Why aren't you dead? What you doing?

158
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,936
Coming for you, asshole.
Fucking believe me.

159
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:42,542
Whatever. I'll be waiting for you.
You ain't gonna make it, though.

160
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:46,825
I'm all about hooking up with that
little Miss Chica you've been banging.

161
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:49,740
I know about that shit.
As soon as your ass is underground.

162
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:52,864
I forgot to say so on that gay
James Bond tape I left for you.

163
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:56,496
Yeah, yeah. What, and then
you're gonna rape my grandmother?

164
00:12:56,587 --> 00:13:00,466
Blah, blah, fucking blah.
Now, listen to me, you little mug.

165
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,983
What do you think Carlito's gonna do
when he finds out what you did?

166
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:07,218
- Your whole crew is history.
- Driver, pull over.

167
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:10,185
- Fuck! Great.
- (sirens wail)

168
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:12,906
Carlito? That's some fucking funny shit,

169
00:13:12,987 --> 00:13:16,024
cos me and Carlito,
we're boys now, we're tight.

170
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:19,304
You haven't been tight since
your brother fucked you.

171
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:23,824
That's snappy. But I did you
pretty good, though. You could admit it.

172
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:27,104
- We'll see.
- (police) Pull over.

173
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:29,826
- You know what the best part is?
- (bleeping)

174
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:32,296
Sorry, must go. Bye-bye.

175
00:13:35,987 --> 00:13:39,866
- Dr Miles.
- What took you so long?

176
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:42,017
Sorry, Chevy. I just got the message.

177
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:44,143
Forget it. Listen, I'm dying.

178
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:47,424
I've been poisoned with some kind
of Chinese synthetic shit.

179
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:50,340
- What?
- You've gotta fucking do something.

180
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:52,543
What are your symptoms?

181
00:13:52,627 --> 00:13:54,538
I'm slowing down, caught in a tar pit.

182
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:56,743
- Blurred vision?
- Yeah.

183
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:58,704
- Dizzy?
- Sure.

184
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:02,177
- Any pain in your chest?
- Not really. I'm feeling pretty good.

185
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:06,064
- What are you doing?
- In a mall, cops chasing me.

186
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:18,536
The flow of adrenaline's
what's keeping you alive.

187
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:22,415
- I'm having trouble hearing you, Doc.
- You gotta keep moving, Chevy.

188
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:26,262
Explain.

189
00:14:26,347 --> 00:14:32,138
If I'm right, they gave you the
Beijing Cocktail. It's very nasty shit.

190
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:38,141
Works on the adrenal gland,
blocks the receptors.

191
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:45,703
The only thing you can do is to keep
the flow of adrenaline constant.

192
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:51,064
- Meaning if you stop, you die.
- Hang on.

193
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:58,465
Jesus. What?
Are you there? Are you OK?

194
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:03,416
- What'd you say, Doc?
- If you stop, you die.

195
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:11,020
That's what I'm trying to do,
keep moving, keep the blood pumping.

196
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:15,978
Chev, are you there? Chevy?

197
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:20,936
Every time I slow down,
it's... like my brain starts to rust.

198
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:23,780
- Have you taken anything?
- Couple of grams of coke.

199
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:27,655
I'll be in LA in about an hour.
I'll call you as soon as I get there.

200
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:30,898
But do not stop moving.
Keep yourself pumped up.

201
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:38,905
Taxi! Yo, yo, yo, yo!

202
00:15:42,227 --> 00:15:44,104
- Go.
- Where we go?

203
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:46,178
Just drive.

204
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:52,227
- Make a right.
- Where do you wanna go, man?

205
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:54,423
Right.

206
00:15:54,507 --> 00:15:57,658
(siren wails)

207
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:03,856
- Oh, shit.
- A right. Make a right.

208
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:17,538
Crank the music up.

209
00:16:19,027 --> 00:16:21,825
(# "Achy Breaky Heart"
by Jarrett and Long)

210
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:23,943
Crank it!

211
00:16:26,147 --> 00:16:29,457
# Don't tell my heart
My achy break heart

212
00:16:29,547 --> 00:16:33,256
- # I just don't think he'd understand
- (heart beats slowly)

213
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:37,101
# And if you tell my heart
My achy break heart

214
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:39,985
# It might blow up and kill this man

215
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:43,742
# Whoo-ooh!

216
00:16:48,187 --> 00:16:50,576
Pull over, pull over.

217
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:54,903
Thanks, mate. Don't go anywhere.
I'll be back in one minute!

218
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:57,182
(taxi driver) OK, cowboy.

219
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,378
Hiya, mate.

220
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:07,378
You move, you die.

221
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,378
(ringing tone)

222
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:44,056
Hey, this is Eve. I'm glad you called...

223
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,580
Fuck!

224
00:17:56,267 --> 00:17:58,417
Where do you wanna go, man?

225
00:17:58,507 --> 00:18:00,498
Beverly Hills.

226
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:14,296
(Spanish rap music)

227
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:59,183
- Chevy.
- Hey, boss.

228
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:01,542
Something urgent's come up.

229
00:19:01,627 --> 00:19:05,176
So I've heard. Word travels fast.

230
00:19:05,267 --> 00:19:08,304
Listen, Carlito, I need your help.
I don't have a lot of time.

231
00:19:08,387 --> 00:19:10,742
No, not much.

232
00:19:10,827 --> 00:19:13,466
You've gotta find an antidote
or something.

233
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:18,782
- What's the matter?
- The shit they gave you.

234
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:22,462
Chinese shit. There is no antidote.

235
00:19:22,547 --> 00:19:26,859
- What, that's it?
- Honestly, you should be dead already.

236
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:28,744
It's a miracle.

237
00:19:28,827 --> 00:19:31,421
- A miracle?
- We give that shit to horses.

238
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:34,977
You don't have to be
so damn fucking cool about it!

239
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:39,258
What do you expect me to do, hm?

240
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:42,498
You're gonna find that punk Verona
and his whole fucking crew

241
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:46,262
and feed them to a cage of wolverines.

242
00:19:46,347 --> 00:19:49,020
What is this?

243
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:53,498
- What, are you boys now or something?
- Verona?

244
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:56,101
That's a small-time punk.

245
00:19:56,187 --> 00:19:58,462
That's not to say
there isn't an opportunity.

246
00:19:58,547 --> 00:19:59,536
Opportunity?

247
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:02,380
Everyone knows
the love I have for you, Chev.

248
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:07,746
Maybe this makes up for the Don Kim
heat which was perhaps ill-advised.

249
00:20:07,827 --> 00:20:10,341
Ill-advised?

250
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:13,658
The heat from Hong Kong has been
much more than we anticipated.

251
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:15,738
That's outstanding, Carlito.

252
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:19,217
Glad to know that my death
can be of some fucking use to you.

253
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:22,583
- Don't be difficult.
- I'm not being difficult.

254
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:27,024
I don't know if you'd noticed, but I'm
having a difficult fucking day, brother!

255
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:36,020
Yah. I'm outta here.

256
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:02,742
Ah! You're not getting in my cab wet.

257
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:04,863
I gave you $200
to wait for three minutes.

258
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,939
You're not getting in my car! No way!

259
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:12,943
Yeah, you're right.
I'm not getting in your cab.

260
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:15,936
Al-Qaeda! Al-Qaeda!

261
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:20,422
I'm American! Get off me!

262
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:31,778
(phone rings)

263
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:36,862
- Yeah.
- Hey, Chev. My flight's been delayed.

264
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:39,336
- Shit.
- No, no, it' all right. Relax.

265
00:21:39,427 --> 00:21:41,418
Don't relax. Listen to me.

266
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:44,385
That shit they gave you
is cutting off your adrenaline.

267
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:49,336
Excitement, fear, danger, it causes
your body to manufacture ephedrine.

268
00:21:49,427 --> 00:21:50,826
Huh?

269
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:53,944
- They've introduced an inhibitor.
- Fuck's sake!

270
00:21:54,027 --> 00:21:59,181
Your only chance is to increase the
ephedrine to force out the inhibitors.

271
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:01,986
Get to the emergency room,
get some epinephrine.

272
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:05,980
It's an artificial adrenaline.
It comes in 10-milligram syringes.

273
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:08,103
It gets potent, so don't overdo it.

274
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:10,143
Probably a fifth of an injection'll do.

275
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:13,264
Chevy? Did you get that?

276
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:17,141
- Did you get that, Chevy?
- Epi-something, yeah.

277
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:20,663
- Nephrine, man.
- OK, OK, OK, I've got it.

278
00:22:20,747 --> 00:22:24,422
- I'll call you when I get there.
- (bleeping)

279
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:26,498
- Yeah.
- Chev.

280
00:22:27,787 --> 00:22:30,506
Yeah? What is it?

281
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:33,263
- Hello?
- (bleeping)

282
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:37,656
- Come on!
- (phone rings)

283
00:22:39,987 --> 00:22:42,296
- Chev.
- Yes. Fuck.

284
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:46,175
I just saw Verona's brother
walk into the Prince.

285
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:49,225
- Interesting. The Prince.
- Yeah. I was getting a taco.

286
00:22:49,307 --> 00:22:52,185
He just walked right in two minutes ago.

287
00:22:56,227 --> 00:23:00,379
- Where are you now?
- Across the street. Where are you?

288
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:03,140
I'm there. Meet me on 7th.

289
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,658
(grunts)

290
00:23:08,747 --> 00:23:10,738
One more.

291
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:24,937
Huh?

292
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:27,018
Is he in there now?

293
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:30,262
Did anyone go in with him?

294
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:36,098
Right, wait here.

295
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,658
(yelps)

296
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:22,498
(yelps)

297
00:24:33,267 --> 00:24:36,020
Shit! Agh!

298
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,462
How'd you like that one, tough guy?

299
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:41,778
How freakin' awesome
was that, huh? Huh?

300
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:51,097
Well, well, well. Feel like talking
to me? Where's your fucking brother?

301
00:24:51,187 --> 00:24:54,497
Doing your mother
like a fucking whore, you bitch.

302
00:24:54,587 --> 00:24:59,138
Nice. Wonder how many steaks
I could carve out of you.

303
00:24:59,227 --> 00:25:01,787
You're dying, motherfucker.

304
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:06,737
# I was born to run
I was born to dream

305
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:09,660
# The craziest boy you ever seen

306
00:25:09,747 --> 00:25:11,863

00:38:36,707 --> 00:38:40,097
There's probably a psychopath
heading over to kill you as we speak.

463
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:42,417
Don't get out of bed.
I'll be there in a flash.

464
00:38:42,507 --> 00:38:44,896
Maybe you can fry me up
a waffle or something, OK?

465
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:48,138
Sure, yeah. Come on over. I'll be here.

466
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:50,183
Right, you'll be there. OK.

467
00:38:50,267 --> 00:38:52,064
(kissing sounds) Bye.

468
00:38:55,347 --> 00:38:57,144
(squeals)

469
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:23,818
(laughs)

470
00:39:36,227 --> 00:39:37,899
So let's go get the bitch.

471
00:39:48,627 --> 00:39:52,939
- (doorbell rings)
- Come on. Please.

472
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:54,824
(doorbell rings)

473
00:39:54,907 --> 00:39:57,296
All right, all right. Jesus.

474
00:39:59,787 --> 00:40:01,459
Oh, my God.

475
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:05,265
(she laughs)

476
00:40:05,347 --> 00:40:07,417
Is this your new look or something?

477
00:40:07,507 --> 00:40:10,146
- Yeah. You into it?
- It's gross.

478
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:16,504
Are you looking for my other boyfriend?

479
00:40:16,587 --> 00:40:18,339
(gasps) Yes.

480
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,658
You haven't turned on the TV today?

481
00:40:21,747 --> 00:40:25,342
- No. Why?
- Didn't think so. We're leaving.

482
00:40:25,427 --> 00:40:28,021
- What? Don't be such a freak.
- Honey, get dressed.

483
00:40:28,107 --> 00:40:31,816
Actually, I'm glad you're here. Can you
change the clock on my microwave?

484
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:33,898
- I never changed it back.
- What?

485
00:40:33,987 --> 00:40:36,547
The microwave.
Can you change the clock?

486
00:40:36,627 --> 00:40:40,142
The daylight savings time,
I never changed it back.

487
00:40:40,227 --> 00:40:42,980
- The microwave?
- Yes.

488
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:46,980
Hey, listen, I bought you some flowers.
They got fucked up on the way over.

489
00:40:47,067 --> 00:40:49,297
That is sweet.

490
00:40:49,387 --> 00:40:52,936
You OK? You look like
you're on drugs or something.

491
00:40:53,027 --> 00:40:55,939
Listen, you love me, yeah?

492
00:40:56,027 --> 00:40:57,779
Yes.

493
00:40:57,867 --> 00:40:59,937
I need you to do something for me.

494
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:02,222
What? What's wrong?

495
00:41:02,307 --> 00:41:06,937
I need you to put some clothes on,
sweetheart, and come with me right now.

496
00:41:07,027 --> 00:41:09,143
- Yeah?
- No.

497
00:41:09,227 --> 00:41:11,980
I'll change the clock
on the microwave. Yeah?

498
00:41:12,067 --> 00:41:14,058
All right.

499
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:34,058
- The shit's wearing off.
- Oh, darn. I forgot.

500
00:41:34,147 --> 00:41:36,581
The waffle iron's on
if you wanna make one.

501
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:39,465
Great. Great.

502
00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:59,338
Agh!

503
00:41:59,707 --> 00:42:01,698
Agh!

504
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:05,143
You're so stressed out.
Do you want some pot or something?

505
00:42:05,227 --> 00:42:07,343
Yeah! No!

506
00:42:07,427 --> 00:42:09,145
(she hums)

507
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:11,183
Ready! What's the matter?

508
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,064
- I burned my hand.
- Oh, my God.

509
00:42:13,147 --> 00:42:15,707
- Let's go, Eve. Don't worry about it.
- I wanna see.

510
00:42:15,787 --> 00:42:17,061
- Hey!
- (screams)

511
00:42:17,147 --> 00:42:19,217
What the?

512
00:42:19,307 --> 00:42:21,104
I'm sorry.

513
00:42:21,187 --> 00:42:25,465
- That was completely uncalled for.
- Can we just?

514
00:42:25,547 --> 00:42:27,538
Fine.

515
00:42:38,427 --> 00:42:40,816
- I parked out the back.
- Oh.

516
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:44,580
- Darn. That... thing.
- What thing?

517
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:47,818
The waffle thing. I gotta turn it off.

518
00:42:55,947 --> 00:42:57,938
(phone rings)

519
00:43:02,387 --> 00:43:03,536
Hello.

520
00:43:04,307 --> 00:43:06,298
Hello.

521
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:14,056
(Eve) All right. Very funny.

522
00:43:15,827 --> 00:43:17,704
God, I hate that.

523
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:22,657
- Whoo!
- Trying to burn the building down?

524
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:34,179
- Oh! My keys.
- Oh, sorry, honey.

525
00:43:34,267 --> 00:43:35,905
Nice one.

526
00:43:35,987 --> 00:43:37,659
(Eve mutters)

527
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:42,697
I swear to God, Chev.

528
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:47,702
I don't know where you are these days,
but it's not working for you.

529
00:43:49,747 --> 00:43:52,705
Ah, my hand cream.
That's where you were.

530
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:04,184
Chev, can I have some help here?

531
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,897
Where is your car?

532
00:44:10,987 --> 00:44:13,217
My car? Actually, I took a cab.

533
00:44:13,307 --> 00:44:15,298
A c?

534
00:44:23,947 --> 00:44:25,938
(hearts beat)

535
00:45:00,947 --> 00:45:02,938
- This isn't gonna be...
- (hiccups)

536
00:45:03,027 --> 00:45:05,746
This isn't gonna be easy, as they say.

537
00:45:05,827 --> 00:45:07,897
(hiccups)

538
00:45:07,987 --> 00:45:11,297
Oh, fuck. All right. Here it is.

539
00:45:11,387 --> 00:45:13,264
Sorry.

540
00:45:14,787 --> 00:45:17,301
(hiccups)

541
00:45:17,387 --> 00:45:22,905
You know I told you I was a video game
programmer? Well, that was a lie.

542
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:24,978
Actually, uh...

543
00:45:27,427 --> 00:45:29,179
I kill people.

544
00:45:29,267 --> 00:45:35,183
Professional hit man. Freelance for
a major West Coast crime syndicate.

545
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:38,543
Last night was a job like
a hundred others, nothing special.

546
00:45:39,907 --> 00:45:44,423
The Triads from Hong Kong had been
moving in on the local drug cartels.

547
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:49,103
My target was the number one man
in Los Angeles, Don Kim.

548
00:45:57,067 --> 00:46:00,776
Well? What are you waiting for?

549
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:05,299
Then this insane idea comes in
through the back of my head

550
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,855
like a.45 slug at close range.

551
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:12,338
Congratulations.

552
00:46:13,827 --> 00:46:17,422
- Did I win something?
- Your life, jackass.

553
00:46:19,267 --> 00:46:23,180
They want you dead,
so sooner or later it's gonna happen,

554
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:25,258
but I'm not doing it.

555
00:46:26,267 --> 00:46:28,576
I see.

556
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:33,582
Instead you're gonna do something
for me. Get out of town, disappear.

557
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:36,977
I don't care where you go,
I don't care what you do,

558
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:39,627
so long as you're invisible
for 48 hours.

559
00:46:39,707 --> 00:46:42,267
That's all I ask.

560
00:46:42,347 --> 00:46:44,338
48 hours?

561
00:46:45,707 --> 00:46:49,586
Or if you prefer,
we'll do it the other way,

562
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:53,342
the way where I go to work
and you meet Buddha.

563
00:47:07,587 --> 00:47:10,465
See, I... I quit.

564
00:47:10,547 --> 00:47:12,936
I quit the business for you.

565
00:47:15,387 --> 00:47:17,947
- For me?
- Yeah.

566
00:47:18,027 --> 00:47:20,018
I figured I'd tell you everything.

567
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:24,419
If you understand, we'd get on a plane
together, never come back.

568
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:27,419
Pretty crazy, huh?

569
00:47:27,507 --> 00:47:29,896
You are so weird.

570
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:32,938
So are we going on a trip?

571
00:47:33,027 --> 00:47:38,055
Well... I might be going on a trip,
but you're not coming with me.

572
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:39,977
(hiccups)

573
00:47:40,307 --> 00:47:43,344
- Eve, Eve, please!
- Mob hits, Chev?

574
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:47,215
Chinese poison? Do you know
how ridiculous you sound?

575
00:47:47,307 --> 00:47:51,300
If you're gonna break up with me,
at least you can tell me the truth.

576
00:47:51,387 --> 00:47:54,106
(distant) Chev? Chev?

577
00:47:55,467 --> 00:47:57,378
What's the matter with you?

578
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:02,465
- Wait a minute. Do you trust me?
- No.

579
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,344
Make love to me.

580
00:48:05,267 --> 00:48:07,064
- What?
- I think it'll help.

581
00:48:07,147 --> 00:48:09,707
Help what? Are you kidding? Get off me.

582
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:12,859
- Take your clothes off.
- No!

583
00:48:12,947 --> 00:48:15,302
Get off me! No!

584
00:48:15,387 --> 00:48:19,016
- You wanna be more spontaneous.
- You're insane!

585
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:21,940
You're like an adrenaline junkie
with no soul.

586
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:25,463
- Save me, Eve. Save my life.
- Stop it!

587
00:48:28,787 --> 00:48:31,096
I'm sorry.

588
00:48:31,187 --> 00:48:34,065
Oh, my God. Are you OK? Are you OK?

589
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:36,658
Oh.

590
00:48:37,627 --> 00:48:40,300
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No.

591
00:48:40,387 --> 00:48:42,378
No! No!

592
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:45,819
Get off!

593
00:48:46,547 --> 00:48:49,015
Get off!

594
00:48:58,747 --> 00:49:04,265
You filthy animal.
Take me right now in front of everyone.

595
00:49:04,947 --> 00:49:07,859
That's it. Ugh. Ah!

596
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:11,257
Come on. Do it!
What are you waiting for?

597
00:49:11,347 --> 00:49:12,905
- Jesus Christ.
- Come on!

598
00:49:12,987 --> 00:49:15,820
I'm trying. Shush, Eve.

599
00:49:15,907 --> 00:49:19,217
- Oh, God. Now you can't get it up?
- Shush, shush.

600
00:49:19,307 --> 00:49:21,298
Come on. Come on! Get it up!

601
00:49:21,387 --> 00:49:23,537
I'll fucking get it up! Jesus!

602
00:49:30,827 --> 00:49:33,182
- Goddamn it, Chev.
- Shut up! Fuck!

603
00:49:34,507 --> 00:49:37,101
(screaming)

604
00:49:46,107 --> 00:49:48,177
I'm alive! I'm alive!

605
00:49:48,267 --> 00:49:50,861
Verona, you motherfucker!

606
00:49:52,947 --> 00:49:54,938
All right! Yes!

607
00:49:55,027 --> 00:49:57,336
Wow! Oh!

608
00:49:58,627 --> 00:50:01,187
- (phone rings)
- Oh, my God!

609
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:05,021
Oh! Yes! Chev!

610
00:50:05,107 --> 00:50:07,746
- Yeah.
- What are you doing? Huh?

611
00:50:07,827 --> 00:50:09,977
- Yeah.
- I've got Verona.

612
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:13,059
- Kaylo?
- I've got Verona, man.

613
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:17,700
- What?
- No shit? Where are you?

614
00:50:17,787 --> 00:50:21,666
- Don Kim' shirt factory. I'm upstairs.
- What's the matter with you?

615
00:50:21,747 --> 00:50:25,217
- Fifth and Alameda?
- Who's at Fifth and Alameda?

616
00:50:25,307 --> 00:50:28,504
You don't let that motherfucker
out of your sight. You hear me?

617
00:50:28,587 --> 00:50:31,260
- I'll be there in ten minutes. Got it?
- Yeah, Chev.

618
00:50:31,347 --> 00:50:33,258
Out.

619
00:50:33,347 --> 00:50:35,144
Honey, I gotta go.

620
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,544
I'll call you!

621
00:50:38,627 --> 00:50:42,222
Oh, God. What are you looking at?

622
00:50:54,267 --> 00:50:57,976
Hey, man. What's the matter with you?
You a crackhead?

623
00:50:58,067 --> 00:51:00,945
No, no. Just step on it, all right?

624
00:51:01,027 --> 00:51:05,418
You're not gonna die in my cab,
crackhead. I got something for you.

625
00:51:07,187 --> 00:51:09,257
(sinister laughter)

626
00:51:10,107 --> 00:51:13,463
You take this Haitian shit, crackhead.
This is some hardcore shit.

627
00:51:13,547 --> 00:51:16,345
It's made from plant shit.

628
00:51:19,707 --> 00:51:21,857
Hey, what are you laughing at?

629
00:51:21,947 --> 00:51:26,145
Look at this. You see that?
That's what a man look like, crackhead.

630
00:51:26,227 --> 00:51:29,537
That's power. Now look at you.

631
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:35,858
What the...

632
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:43,298
(echoing laughter)

633
00:51:45,747 --> 00:51:47,738
Yeah?

634
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:50,618
Tastes like ass.

635
00:51:53,827 --> 00:51:56,500
Well, that's right, devil. You wait.

636
00:52:19,667 --> 00:52:21,385
- (groans)
- Shut the fuck up!

637
00:52:21,467 --> 00:52:22,456
Say goodbye.

638
00:52:22,547 --> 00:52:24,663
- No!
- Get the fuck open!

639
00:52:24,747 --> 00:52:26,260
No!

640
00:52:32,747 --> 00:52:35,307
Oop, there it is.

641
00:52:35,387 --> 00:52:37,378
Fuck him.

642
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:44,498
We're here.

643
00:52:49,627 --> 00:52:54,018
- What'd you say was in this stuff?
- I told you, it's hardcore.

644
00:52:59,867 --> 00:53:01,858
That'll be 5.35.

645
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:07,138
So are you, man.

646
00:53:08,467 --> 00:53:10,458
Have a nice day, devil.

647
00:53:15,387 --> 00:53:17,378
This is fucked.

648
00:53:19,227 --> 00:53:21,218
Where's he going?

649
00:53:25,347 --> 00:53:27,497
Yeah, OK.

650
00:53:27,587 --> 00:53:31,865
How the fuck you gonna call me
talking shit? I don't know where he at.

651
00:53:31,947 --> 00:53:33,938
I ain't baby-sitting the motherfucker.

652
00:53:34,027 --> 00:53:36,495
Fucking call me talking shit. Shit.

653
00:53:38,987 --> 00:53:41,899
I'm doing my job. I'm doing my shit.

654
00:53:43,827 --> 00:53:47,456
I'm out here just chilling,
doing what I do, on the rooftop...

655
00:53:47,547 --> 00:53:51,904
Whoa, Chevy, Chevy. What's up, dog?
Everything all right? You chilling?

656
00:53:51,987 --> 00:53:54,740
- What a fucking coincidence.
- What you talking about?

657
00:53:54,827 --> 00:53:58,740
- You waiting for a bus?
- I thought a helicopter'd pick me up.

658
00:53:58,827 --> 00:54:00,624
- What the fuck is this?
- What?

659
00:54:00,707 --> 00:54:02,823
- You working for the Chinese?
- Chinese?

660
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:04,898
You crazy? I wouldn't do that to you.

661
00:54:04,987 --> 00:54:08,138
- I am crazy. Where's Kaylo?
- Uh...

662
00:54:08,227 --> 00:54:11,264
- OK, ding. Time's up.
- What d'you mean, ding?

663
00:54:11,347 --> 00:54:13,144
What d'you mean, ding? Ah!

664
00:54:13,227 --> 00:54:15,218
(thuds)

665
00:54:18,907 --> 00:54:21,296
(Chev) Where is that motherfucker?

666
00:54:21,387 --> 00:54:23,378
Chev.

667
00:54:24,947 --> 00:54:29,737
- What the fuck is this?
- Chev, baby. Take it easy.

668
00:54:29,827 --> 00:54:31,624
You mean like this?

669
00:54:33,747 --> 00:54:38,218
Now you tell me where that
little toerag motherfucker is. Verona.

670
00:54:38,307 --> 00:54:40,980
Verona's got nothing to do with this.

671
00:54:42,387 --> 00:54:44,105
What?

672
00:54:44,187 --> 00:54:47,497
Don Carlos wants you off the streets.

673
00:54:47,587 --> 00:54:51,216
- Carlito?
- You've totally lost your shit, dog.

674
00:54:51,307 --> 00:54:56,062
You're all over TV, destroying property,
making unauthorised hits.

675
00:54:56,147 --> 00:55:00,663
You're causing the organisation
a great deal of embarrassment.

676
00:55:00,747 --> 00:55:03,386
You're telling me Carlito wanted this?

677
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:06,186
Don't worry about Verona.
We'll take care of him.

678
00:55:06,267 --> 00:55:10,624
The best thing for you to do
is find some nice, dark, quiet place

679
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:13,096
and... just die.

680
00:55:20,027 --> 00:55:26,375
Just die. What, do you think
I've got "cunt" written on my forehead?

681
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:36,945
- Maybe you're right.
- We all gotta die sometime, right?

682
00:55:37,027 --> 00:55:39,461
Yeah.

683
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:42,061
We all gotta die sometime.

684
00:55:42,147 --> 00:55:45,025
(Chev) So I'll just die.

685
00:55:49,147 --> 00:55:50,865
What the?

686
00:55:55,747 --> 00:55:58,136
(gunfire)

687
00:56:14,627 --> 00:56:16,424
(Eve screams)

688
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:20,625
Oh, my fucking arm!
You miserable motherfucker!

689
00:56:20,707 --> 00:56:23,096
- Oh!
- Jesus! Eve, move!

690
00:56:28,227 --> 00:56:30,661
(he continues shouting)

691
00:56:39,227 --> 00:56:42,139
- Asshole. What d'you want?
- Don't talk to him like that!

692
00:56:42,227 --> 00:56:44,457
My boyfriend kills people.

693
00:56:44,547 --> 00:56:45,821
Nice.

694
00:56:45,907 --> 00:56:47,898
(continues shouting)

695
00:57:25,467 --> 00:57:27,662
(gunfire)

696
00:58:13,387 --> 00:58:15,776
I had to see
if you were telling the truth.

697
00:58:19,227 --> 00:58:20,740
Come on.

698
00:58:21,987 --> 00:58:23,659
No, wait!

699
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:31,458
Now come on.

700
00:58:33,107 --> 00:58:34,984
Oh, God! Ooh!

701
00:58:37,587 --> 00:58:40,784
Oh, damn it.
I forgot to take my birth-control pills.

702
00:58:40,867 --> 00:58:43,017
- What?
- Yeah.

703
00:58:43,107 --> 00:58:44,699
- Where are the keys?
- Chev.

704
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:47,096
- Eve, the keys.
- Here. Ow.

705
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:53,783
- (Chev) Come on, come on.
- My stuff!

706
00:58:54,507 --> 00:58:57,101
All my stuff!

707
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:26,740
- You weren't lying.
- Welcome to my life.

708
00:59:28,627 --> 00:59:32,222
No. I mean,
that you would give it all up for me.

709
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:34,295
Yeah.

710
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:39,986
- And the other part?
- The poison? Yeah, that's true too.

711
00:59:40,067 --> 00:59:42,786
Then that means...

712
00:59:42,867 --> 00:59:44,698
Pretty much.

713
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:51,937
- How can we stop it?
- Adrenaline slows it down.

714
00:59:54,827 --> 00:59:58,615
- So when were in Chinatown?
- Yeah, sorry.

715
01:00:02,827 --> 01:00:05,785
- Eve, what are you doing?
- This'll get you going.

716
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:08,859
- What?
- Come on. Finish what you started.

717
01:00:08,947 --> 01:00:10,539
Oh, boy.

718
01:00:12,507 --> 01:00:16,295
Oh, that's it.
That's really working for me.

719
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:19,497
- You like that?
- Stay down!

720
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,862
Motherfucker!

721
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:33,583
Oh! Jesus! Oh, yeah, that's it, baby!
Just a little more.

722
01:00:37,547 --> 01:00:40,345
Stay down, Eve.

723
01:00:47,827 --> 01:00:51,103
- Ah, Jesus.
- Oh, you're so big.

724
01:00:52,707 --> 01:00:54,823
Oh, my God.

725
01:00:58,107 --> 01:01:00,098
Just a touch...

726
01:01:01,547 --> 01:01:03,185
What's the matter?

727
01:01:03,267 --> 01:01:08,182
So you can fall asleep
like you always do? I don't think so.

728
01:01:08,267 --> 01:01:09,939
Jesus fuck!

729
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:52,697
Are they really?

730
01:01:52,787 --> 01:01:55,381
They're dead.

731
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:58,578
How can you do that?

732
01:01:59,547 --> 01:02:02,266
- I told you, baby. I quit.
- (phone rings)

733
01:02:02,907 --> 01:02:03,896
Yeah.

734
01:02:03,987 --> 01:02:07,138
Chev, I've been trying
to get hold of you for half an hour.

735
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:10,822
- Where the fuck have you been?
- In my office. Can you make it here?

736
01:02:10,907 --> 01:02:13,296
Sure. Why not?

737
01:02:16,187 --> 01:02:22,456
Chocolate, what's this fucking receipt
from Gold Food's Market for $254?

738
01:02:22,547 --> 01:02:23,900
Snacks.

739
01:02:34,187 --> 01:02:35,984
I owe you again, Doc.

740
01:02:36,067 --> 01:02:38,740
Chevy, you're my best customer.

741
01:02:41,107 --> 01:02:44,179
- What is this stuff?
- Synthetic ephedrine.

742
01:02:44,267 --> 01:02:46,735
Delivered with some saline.

743
01:02:46,827 --> 01:02:48,624
Feels sort of good.

744
01:02:48,707 --> 01:02:54,896
I got a little meth in there too, so
that's the endorphins you're feeling.

745
01:02:56,787 --> 01:02:59,745
Wait a minute. What, so I'm not better?

746
01:02:59,827 --> 01:03:04,105
Fuck, no, you're not better.
You're in such shit shape it's stunning.

747
01:03:04,187 --> 01:03:10,660
I can't believe your heart's beating.
Should be in a fucking medical journal.

748
01:03:15,627 --> 01:03:17,424
So what are you gonna do?

749
01:03:17,507 --> 01:03:20,544
This solution is acting
as a competing inhibitor.

750
01:03:20,627 --> 01:03:23,425
It's pushing the poison
out of your receptors

751
01:03:23,507 --> 01:03:25,304
and replacing it with a chemical.

752
01:03:25,387 --> 01:03:28,220
- But this is a temporary fix.
- Then what?

753
01:03:28,307 --> 01:03:30,980
You're fucked.

754
01:03:31,587 --> 01:03:37,344
Uh, I can put you on life support, Chev,
and string this out for a few days.

755
01:03:37,427 --> 01:03:41,215
But you're gonna go into a coma
at some point and...

756
01:03:41,307 --> 01:03:43,696
Does she know?

757
01:03:46,507 --> 01:03:52,184
Why don't you let me load you up
and you can go out in a beautiful dream?

758
01:03:53,507 --> 01:03:55,498
Dream.

759
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:58,858
Can I do that for you?

760
01:04:01,707 --> 01:04:04,460
No, no, no.

761
01:04:04,547 --> 01:04:06,742
That's not what I want.

762
01:04:06,827 --> 01:04:09,261
What do you want?

763
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:11,338
One hour.

764
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:16,181
I want one hour.

765
01:04:24,787 --> 01:04:27,176
I don't fucking believe it.

766
01:04:29,747 --> 01:04:34,298
So the wild rampage that began at 9am
in West Los Angeles continues,

767
01:04:34,387 --> 01:04:38,175
the mysterious suspect still at large.

768
01:04:38,267 --> 01:04:41,498
Maybe we should have given him
more of that Chinese shit.

769
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:43,578
Oh, you think?

770
01:04:45,547 --> 01:04:48,061
(phone rings)

771
01:04:48,147 --> 01:04:49,944
Dude, it's him.

772
01:04:50,027 --> 01:04:52,746
- (gunfire on video game)
- Turn this thing off.

773
01:04:52,827 --> 01:04:55,819
- What's up, corpse?
- Bonjour, douchebag.

774
01:04:55,907 --> 01:04:58,785
Thought you might be interested
in a little deal.

775
01:04:58,867 --> 01:05:02,701
- You a dealer? That what you are now?
- Don't you worry about what I am.

776
01:05:02,787 --> 01:05:04,937
Listen, I want the antidote.

777
01:05:05,027 --> 01:05:07,985
Oh. Oh, the antidote.

778
01:05:08,067 --> 01:05:11,821
- That' right. The antidote.
- What are you prepared to give me?

779
01:05:11,907 --> 01:05:16,378
The jewellery I got off that faggot
brother of yours, fucking cocksucker?

780
01:05:16,467 --> 01:05:19,937
- Hm.
- Don't pop a blood vessel, you penis.

781
01:05:20,027 --> 01:05:22,302
- All right.
- You like that deal, do you?

782
01:05:22,387 --> 01:05:25,618
- Whatever.
- I'll be at the Lint in 20 minutes.

783
01:05:25,707 --> 01:05:27,504
- You know the spot?
- I know it.

784
01:05:27,587 --> 01:05:31,421
Don't be late, or I'll trade this thing
to some whore for a fucking hand job.

785
01:05:31,507 --> 01:05:35,420
Look, I said I'll fucking be!
If you don't fucking be there!

786
01:05:35,507 --> 01:05:37,941
- See you later, sunshine.
- Turn that shit off!

787
01:05:38,027 --> 01:05:40,222
Goddamn it. Fuck.

788
01:05:45,427 --> 01:05:50,342
Yo, it's Verona. You're not gonna
believe this call I just got.

789
01:06:04,187 --> 01:06:07,862
- (Chev) lt' gonna be all right, baby.
- (Eve) But you said...

790
01:06:07,947 --> 01:06:12,498
(Chev) I know. Things have changed.
There' an antidote.

791
01:06:12,587 --> 01:06:16,580
Gonna make a deal for it,
but I've gotta go alone.

792
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:19,261
- (Eve) I'm scared.
- Of course.

793
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,695
(Chev) You'll be safe now,
and I'll be back.

794
01:06:23,907 --> 01:06:25,704
Promise?

795
01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:27,980
I promise.

796
01:06:58,027 --> 01:07:00,621
(heart beats)

797
01:07:03,107 --> 01:07:05,177
(heart beats faster)

798
01:07:25,387 --> 01:07:27,378
What's happening, bro?

799
01:07:47,827 --> 01:07:52,423
- (woman' voice) Where did I go wrong?
- Did you fucking just say something?

800
01:07:52,507 --> 01:07:54,975
It's like talking to the wall.

801
01:07:56,987 --> 01:07:57,976
Mum?

802
01:07:58,067 --> 01:08:00,820
I'm amazed you remember
you have a mother.

803
01:08:00,907 --> 01:08:03,705
Mum, please,
I haven't got time for this.

804
01:08:03,787 --> 01:08:07,143
- (Orlando) You got no time, period.
- Orlando?

805
01:08:07,227 --> 01:08:10,344
You're a persistent motherfucker,
Chev Chelios.

806
01:08:10,427 --> 01:08:13,897
- They pop you and you keep getting up.
- I'm the Terminator.

807
01:08:13,987 --> 01:08:17,900
(Verona) You was, maybe,
but there's a new gun in town.

808
01:08:17,987 --> 01:08:22,936
I don't get it. Why didn't you just cut
me up alive when you had the chance?

809
01:08:23,027 --> 01:08:25,257
Too easy, motherfucker. Look at you.

810
01:08:25,347 --> 01:08:28,623
Bipolar, sadomasochistic tendencies.

811
01:08:28,707 --> 01:08:31,699
(Chev) Adrenaline junkie.
Addicted to violence.

812
01:08:31,787 --> 01:08:36,224
Carving up a guy like that while he
screams in his own blood and excrement

813
01:08:36,307 --> 01:08:40,585
would be like a gift, a warrior's death.

814
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:42,703
Hell, you'd probably get off on it.

815
01:08:42,787 --> 01:08:44,778
What the hell are you, anyway?

816
01:08:48,227 --> 01:08:51,742
- I think I'm starting to figure it out.
- Well, better late than never.

817
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:56,662
- You know you're gonna die up there?
- Yeah, maybe.

818
01:08:56,747 --> 01:08:58,703
But I'm taking you with me.

819
01:09:01,947 --> 01:09:03,938
Some pills, Doc.

820
01:09:18,827 --> 01:09:22,024
- Chelios.
- Hello, girls.

821
01:09:29,547 --> 01:09:31,538
Hold up.

822
01:09:32,307 --> 01:09:34,298
Give me the piece.

823
01:09:53,267 --> 01:09:55,735
Now, isn't that a fucking picture?

824
01:09:55,827 --> 01:09:59,581
Chelios.
What a fucking nightmare you are.

825
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:02,864
- No shit.
- Why don't you sit down?

826
01:10:04,147 --> 01:10:06,786
Wait a minute. You pat him down again.

827
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:09,335
I know he's carrying something.

828
01:10:13,107 --> 01:10:15,063
Let me see that.

829
01:10:17,707 --> 01:10:22,144
- Fuck.
- It's clever. Is this an insulin pump?

830
01:10:22,227 --> 01:10:25,503
- Basically.
- What the fuck is insulin, man?

831
01:10:26,627 --> 01:10:29,187
- Ephedrine, right?
- Yeah.

832
01:10:30,027 --> 01:10:32,416
Very resourceful.

833
01:10:34,507 --> 01:10:38,420
- Found a new master, little bitch?
- I'm nobody's little bitch.

834
01:10:38,507 --> 01:10:42,500
We'll see what kind of a bitch you are
when Carlito hires you and you take it.

835
01:10:42,587 --> 01:10:44,100
(Carlito) That's enough.

836
01:10:44,187 --> 01:10:47,975
You'll throw him a reach-around to show
him what a good little bitch you are.

837
01:10:48,067 --> 01:10:51,821
I'm nobody's little bitch!
You fucking hear me?

838
01:10:51,907 --> 01:10:53,898
And he'll pay me when I tell him to pay.

839
01:10:53,987 --> 01:10:56,660
I said that's enough! Now sit down!

840
01:11:01,307 --> 01:11:04,140
It's been a long fucking day.

841
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:07,742
But in the end, you have to admit,
it all works out quite nicely.

842
01:11:07,827 --> 01:11:11,137
Don Kim gets his bullet, thanks to you,

843
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:13,582
and Hong Kong
gets a goat to take the fall.

844
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:15,146
(goat bleats)

845
01:11:15,227 --> 01:11:19,220
Please understand, Chev,
it's truly nothing personal.

846
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:21,423
You speak for yourself.

847
01:11:21,507 --> 01:11:23,225
(blows kiss)

848
01:11:23,307 --> 01:11:26,856
That what I think it is?

849
01:11:26,947 --> 01:11:29,177
It's the Chinese shit.

850
01:11:29,267 --> 01:11:31,622
Hold him down.

851
01:11:33,547 --> 01:11:36,664
Not so fast, motherfucker.

852
01:11:37,787 --> 01:11:39,982
What does this guy think he's doing?

853
01:11:42,347 --> 01:11:43,985
Whatever, psycho.

854
01:11:46,627 --> 01:11:50,176
I'm afraid the Houdini act
is over, my friend.

855
01:11:50,547 --> 01:11:53,186
(trigger clicks)

856
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:54,495
Boosh.

857
01:11:57,827 --> 01:12:00,057
- Our Father, who art in heaven...
- Shut up.

858
01:12:00,147 --> 01:12:02,945
So this is how it is.

859
01:12:04,747 --> 01:12:07,181
It's Don Kim. He's supposed to be dead.

860
01:12:07,267 --> 01:12:08,541
Presto.

861
01:12:29,107 --> 01:12:30,222
Go, go, go, go!

862
01:12:30,307 --> 01:12:33,458
Police have moved to surround
the downtown Hotel Lint,

863
01:12:33,547 --> 01:12:36,186
where the madman
behind today's mayhem

864
01:12:36,267 --> 01:12:40,260
is believed to be holed up
and making a desperate last stand.

865
01:12:40,347 --> 01:12:42,941
Officials have confirmed gunfire
on the sundeck.

866
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:47,737
Our news chopper will be bringing
live coverage from above the hotel.

867
01:12:47,827 --> 01:12:52,981
This coverage is live and uncensored,
so if you have small children present,

868
01:12:53,067 --> 01:12:55,376
you may wanna have them
leave the room.

869
01:13:06,947 --> 01:13:09,336
Get me out of here now!

870
01:13:16,747 --> 01:13:20,183
- I'll kill you for this, Chelios!
- Too late.

871
01:13:26,147 --> 01:13:28,297
Look out!

872
01:13:28,387 --> 01:13:30,423
Thanks, boss.

873
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:50,179
Get us outta here now! Let's go!

874
01:14:56,267 --> 01:14:58,417
Present from Kaylo...

875
01:15:05,947 --> 01:15:09,496
- Now what? Now you say shit!
- Where the fuck were you?

876
01:15:10,427 --> 01:15:13,100
Who's the bitch now?

877
01:15:18,627 --> 01:15:21,221
You fly, motherfucker!

878
01:15:22,747 --> 01:15:25,978
Motherfucking fly!

879
01:15:54,147 --> 01:15:55,341
(chuckles)

880
01:16:12,107 --> 01:16:13,096
You're dead!

881
01:16:14,347 --> 01:16:16,338
Oh, my God.

882
01:16:28,387 --> 01:16:31,140
You're dead! You're dead, motherfucker!

883
01:16:59,747 --> 01:17:02,784
Told you I'd kill you, you little bitch!

884
01:17:02,867 --> 01:17:04,459
(neck cracks)

885
01:17:21,547 --> 01:17:23,538
(ringing tone)

886
01:17:24,627 --> 01:17:27,699
Hey, this is Eve.
I'm glad you called, but I'm not here.

887
01:17:27,787 --> 01:17:32,065
Leave a message. Unless you're trying to
sell something, cos I'm not interested.

888
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:35,457
If you're not, then just...
Oh, wait. Time' up.

889
01:17:35,547 --> 01:17:37,936
- (bleeps)
- Hey, doll.

890
01:17:40,027 --> 01:17:43,463
Looks like I let you down again.

891
01:17:43,547 --> 01:17:50,897
Seems like all my life
I've just been going, going, going...

892
01:17:50,987 --> 01:17:56,380
I wish I'd taken more time to stop
and smell the roses, so to speak.

893
01:17:57,587 --> 01:18:00,659
But I guess it's too late for that now.

894
01:18:05,267 --> 01:18:07,656
You're the greatest, baby.

895
01:18:07,747 --> 01:18:11,535
# If only you believe
like I believe, baby

896
01:18:11,627 --> 01:18:13,618
# Like I believe

897
01:18:13,707 --> 01:18:15,857
# We'd get by

898
01:18:15,947 --> 01:18:18,017
# If only you believe

899
01:18:29,307 --> 01:18:31,582
