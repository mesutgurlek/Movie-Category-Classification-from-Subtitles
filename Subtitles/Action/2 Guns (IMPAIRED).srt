With Little Toro off the board,
Jessup's pulling you out.

314
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,635
Not if you
don't tell him.

I'm your control, Bobby.
That's correct.

That's why I need you

318
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,511
to let me rob
Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.

319
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:24,248
No, Stig wants to rob
the bank. It's his idea.

320
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,516
So there's no entrapment.

321
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,186
What I want
is access to that money

322
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,421
that Papi's got
in the safe deposit box.

323
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,756
You know no judge
is gonna give you

324
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,725
a blanket warrant
for the boxes.

325
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,527
We don't need a warrant.
Not if the money's evidence in a crime.

326
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,129
We just trace it
back to ownership,

327
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:40,631
we got Papi on tax evasion,
possible RICO.

Yeah.

329

330
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,269
What about him?

331
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:46,604
He's a side dish.

332

that matters, right?

it takes, baby.

like that happen to you before?

that to say what?

be Papi's money.

open the vault.

opinion, Gomer?

a coincidence,

supposed to come out of that bank

at most, sir.

Bobby Beans was DEA?

585
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:32,556
No offense, sir,
but you really need to work on your surprised face.

586
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,093
Well, if he was DEA,
he helped you rob a bank.

587
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:38,462
Which means he's dirty,
and for that, I have no mercy.

588
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,332
Where'd you leave him?
In the desert.

589

Is he dead?
More than likely.

"More than likely."

You wanna tell me
what that means?

592
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:53,944
The whole point of you
working with Bobby Beans

593
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,345
was to kill him off
and create a cut-out

594

so the op couldn't
get traced back to us.

There's no way it'll trace back.

There's no way it'll trace back, sir.

above your pay grade.

Yes, sir.

the money back at the naval base.

00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,005
Oh, shit!

943
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,544
Come on, Bobby,
I ain't got all damn day!

What do you wanna do?

947
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:47,976
(BOTH GRUNTING)

948
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:51,013
Ow!

949
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,031
All right. All right, all right.
All right, let me go.

950
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,099
You let me go first.

951
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:11,467
No, you let me go.

952
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:13,001
On three.
On three.

953
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:16,071
One. Two. Three.

954
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:18,707
See? Now you're making me
not be able to trust you.

955
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,409
On the count of three,
we'll let each other go.

956
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:21,510
All right?
All right. That's fair.

957
00:56:21,512 --> 00:56:22,911
One. Two.

958
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:23,979
Three.

959
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,115
I knew it.
Let me go.

960
00:56:26,117 --> 00:56:28,550
No! I'm gonna let you go.
I'm gonna let you go.

961
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:29,718
All right.
One...

962
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,789
(SIGHS)

963
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,124
(LAUGHING)
Ow!

964
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,693
Ow!

965
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:40,429
Come on, man. You gotta admit,
that was kind of fun, no?

966
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,031
You didn't like that?

967
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:44,566
Who are you?

968
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:45,734
(CHUCKLES) Shit.

969
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,905
U.S. Navy Intel.
Yeah?

970
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:51,540
Or I was.

971
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:53,876
My commander
FUBARed my jacket.

972
00:56:53,878 --> 00:56:55,944
And now I'm AWOL
after stabbing an MP.

973
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:59,782
You're lucky.
They got me framed for killing my boss.

974
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:01,884
Did your boss order your four closest friends to kill you?

975
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,421
No, you got me there.

976
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:12,461
DEA Officer Bobby Trench,
but I guess you know that already.

977
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:13,629
Pleasure.

978
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:15,998
So, what,
you just happened to pick me,

979
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,100
or you got orders to
set me up on purpose?

980
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,035
I had orders, man.
I didn't know you were DEA.

981
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:21,437
My people did.
But they're Intel.

982
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:22,438
There's not much
they don't know.

983
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,872
Your people?

984
00:57:23,874 --> 00:57:27,509
So I can take it over my
commander's head to the Admiral.

985
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:29,111
That's why they wanna kill me
and why I wanted to talk to Papi.

986
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,046
Right.

987
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,916
Well...

988
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:37,786
I guess we can both talk to him at the same time.

989
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:38,987
What, like we're
workin' together?

990
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:40,222
No, not like we're
working together.

991
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:43,091
No, like we're workin'
in the same vicinity.

992
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:45,127
Together.
In the same area code.

993
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:46,895
Together.
The same county.

994
00:57:46,897 --> 00:57:48,997
And don't get all <i>We Are The World on me either.</i>

995
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:51,800
When this is over, I'm still gonna shoot you.
But we're partners.

996
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,469
Come on, man,
<i>Ebony and Ivory.</i>

997
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:55,204
Shit, I think he puked.
He's puked or he's dead.

998
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:57,973
Oh, yeah, he puked.

999
00:57:58,541 --> 00:57:59,675
Hey.

1000
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,112
(GROANING) I'm gonna
fuckin' kill you both.

1001
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:05,647
This might take a while.

1002
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,149
STIG: I got
all day, partner.

1003
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:10,018
Let me put that in there with ya.
Put that on ya.

1004
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:19,595
So, partner,
how you wanna do this?

1005
00:58:19,597 --> 00:58:21,497
I like that,
it's got a nice roll off your tongue there.

1006
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:24,800
We're not that close.
Don't kumbaya with me. Don't kumbaya.

1007
00:58:24,802 --> 00:58:27,936
I'm gonna get my bucket and
towel and waterboard his ass.

1008
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:30,539
No, we gotta give him a chance to talk.
You got anything to say?

1009
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:32,674
I hope you guys like
the taste of balls,

1010
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,978
because I'm gonna chop yours off,
stuff 'em in your mouths.

1011
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,713
See?

1012
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:40,983
Or maybe I'll put yours in his and his in yours.

1013
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:42,050
Want me to get
the bucket?

1014
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,051
Kumbaya.
(LAUGHS)

1015
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:48,957
So why were you puttin' so much money in Tres Cruces?

1016
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,126
It's <i>Tres Cruces.</i>

1017
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:53,829
We thought you just stashed a little cash there

1018
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:56,798
until we robbed the place,
found 40 million. Why is that?

1019
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,966
You robbed <i>Tres Cruces?</i>

1020
00:58:57,968 --> 00:58:59,201
That's correct.
Why is that?

1021
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:00,802
(LAUGHING)

1022
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,939
BOBBY: That's funny, huh?

1023
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:05,674
PAPI: (CHUCKLING)
You're dead.

1024
00:59:05,676 --> 00:59:07,142
Yeah, that is funny,
isn't it? You're both dead.

1025
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:08,243
(GROANS)

1026
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,313
And I didn't even
have to kill you.

1027
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:15,083
I thought you were sharp.
"I-know-a-guy" Bobby.

1028
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,586
But you...

1029
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:19,187
You just
ripped off the CIA.

1030
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,190
(CHUCKLING SOFTLY)

1031
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,326
The CIA?

1032
00:59:24,328 --> 00:59:26,228
The CIA.

1033
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,697
He's full of crap. Why would he have
money in the same bank as the CIA?

1034
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:30,799
Why would you have money
in the same bank as the CIA?

1035
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:32,334
I don't have shit
in that bank.

1036
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:35,103
The only money I deliver to <i>Tres Cruces</i>

1037
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:38,006
is a payment.
To the CIA?

1038
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:41,977
The CIA.
They take 7% of my revenue.

1039
00:59:41,979 --> 00:59:44,913
In return,
they let me use their planes

1040
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,214
so I can get my shit
across the border.

1041
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:52,020
I could do it a lot cheaper,
but there was really no negotiations.

1042
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:54,222
You know...

1043
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:56,191
They take it from
all the cartels.

1044
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:58,360
Bullshit.

1045
00:59:58,362 --> 01:00:00,228
Okay.

1046
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,730
They're still
gonna kill you.

You said stop by anytime.

01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:16,945
You kidnapped a drug kingpin!
That's correct.

And you tied him up in my garage!

We never put a name on it.

you broke his heart or he broke yours?

Wow, this guy will really ask
anyone anything at anytime.

Why don't you go and
check on Papi, huh?

You can have the yogurt. Here.

you can trust this guy?

01:11:11,568 --> 01:11:14,469
You got 24 hours
to bring me the money.

1254
01:11:14,471 --> 01:11:16,004
Or I'm gonna shoot her
right in the head.

1255
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:19,407
Then I'm gonna find you,

1256
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:21,609
and I'm gonna
gut you like a pig!

1257
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:23,411
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

(SLOW ROCK SONG PLAYING)

1259
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:26,607
Stig!

1260
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,840
When this is over,
I'm still gonna shoot you.

1261
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:01,909
Whatever it takes, Bobby.

1262
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,087
STIG: Pick one.
I can get in anything.

1263
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:17,392
No, I don't do German, okay?
Locks are tricky, too many alarms.

1264
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:19,060
Okay. Suburban?

1265
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:22,764
It's gonna get like two miles a gallon.
I ain't payin' for all that gas.

1266
01:13:22,766 --> 01:13:24,732
For a car thief,
you are mighty particular.

1267
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:26,067
I'll break
into the Honda.

1268
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:27,168
I look like I'm gonna ride
in that Honda to you?

1269
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:29,003
You could.

1270
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:30,171
And you could pick somethin' with a little more class.

1271
01:13:30,173 --> 01:13:31,739
I hate to remind you,
but we're breakin'

1272
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,040
onto a high-security
Navy base.

1273
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:35,977
It ain't no (MISPRONOUNCES)
<i>Les Misérables for you tonight.</i>

1274
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:38,012
Oh, man,
whatever the fuck, man.

1275
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:42,984
Look, it's not my fault Quince
took the money back to the base.

1276
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:44,585
I thought you said you took the money back to the base.

1277
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,087
No, I never said that.

1278
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,555
So the money
could be anywhere.

1279
01:13:47,557 --> 01:13:49,457
It could be in East Jabip,
the Cayman Islands...

1280
01:13:49,459 --> 01:13:50,958
No, the money
is on the base, okay?

1281
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,794
I gave it to Commander Quince at the Camino Real,

1282
01:13:52,796 --> 01:13:56,964
Right before he took you out and tried to kill you.

1283
01:13:56,966 --> 01:13:59,000
That doesn't mean
he's lyin' about the base.

1284
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:02,136
Not everybody's as paranoid as you, Bobby. Jeez.

1285
01:14:02,138 --> 01:14:04,172
What about the Prius?
You like the Prius?

1286
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:06,707
Camino Real.

1287
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:07,809
Yeah, it's a hotel.

1288
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,077
I met Debbie
at the Camino Real.

1289
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:11,446
No shit?

1290
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:15,049
She said she was there to meet her boyfriend, Harvey.

1291
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:16,818
Wait. Your girlfriend
has a boyfriend?

1292
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,019
She's not my girlfriend.

1293
01:14:19,154 --> 01:14:20,054
Holy shit.

1294
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,024
Yeah, just pick a car.

1295
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:24,926
Right here.

1296
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:26,994
You picked that one?

1297
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:28,863
Yeah.

1298
01:14:28,865 --> 01:14:30,465
Fuck you want,
a fuckin' Bentley?

1299
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:32,066
I got it.

1300
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:50,952
WOMAN: Hi.
Hey.

1301
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:53,988
Crazy question,

1302
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,591
you wouldn't have anybody
knows how to fix a snowmobile?

1303
01:14:56,593 --> 01:15:00,127
Would you check for me?
I really need it fixed by tonight.

1304
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:01,762
Why, a big storm coming?

1305
01:15:01,764 --> 01:15:03,631
You never can be too sure.

1306
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,933
I'll be right back.

1307
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,270
Up with that?
What?

1308
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:11,672
She smiled at you,
you didn't wink at her?

1309
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:13,875
I don't wink
at every woman I see.

1310
01:15:13,877 --> 01:15:17,512
Snowmobile in Texas, huh?
You must be in some serious shit, sailor.

1311
01:15:17,514 --> 01:15:19,013
You got yourself
a new claw, huh?

1312
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,982
Gimme claw.
Give it a pound. It's a beaut.

1313
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:22,917
You still got
my rainy-day stash?

1314
01:15:22,919 --> 01:15:24,085
Yeah.

1315
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,524
See ya later, Stig.

1316
01:15:29,526 --> 01:15:30,691
All right.

1317
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:37,064
STIG: You know what they say,
talk softly and carry an M-4 with a grenade launcher.

1318
01:15:37,066 --> 01:15:38,165
BOBBY: Wow.

1319
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,202
Which one you want?

1320
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:42,937
This one.

1321
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:44,639
What's your plan
for gettin' on the base?

1322
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:45,740
I'm workin' on it.

1323
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:02,590
Remember, once we get
to the command building,

1324
01:16:02,592 --> 01:16:06,227
If he's not in the field,
that's where he lives 18 hours a day.

1325
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:07,795
Right, right.
But you still haven't told me

1326
01:16:07,797 --> 01:16:09,630
what the plan is to get through the gate.

1327
01:16:09,632 --> 01:16:12,066
I got a plan. I mean,
I'm capable of comin' up with a plan.

1328
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:14,669
I'm just sayin' you haven't told me.
What is it?

1329
01:16:14,671 --> 01:16:16,137
I'm workin' on it.

(SIGHS)

1331
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,306
Better work faster.

1332
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:25,746
Much faster.

Quickly.

He's going through!

1337
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,290

1338
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:40,761

Let's go! On the radio now!

(SIRENS BLARING)

1342
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:54,909
That was your plan?

1343
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:59,080
That's not a plan.
Nobody in their right mind breaks into a naval base.

1344
01:16:59,082 --> 01:17:00,815
That's why it's a brilliant plan.
No one expected it.

1345
01:17:00,817 --> 01:17:03,884
You shoulda seen your face.
Damn, they were surprised.

1346
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:05,319
Your stop comin' up.
I'll play decoy,

1347
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:07,121
lead 'em away,
try to get to the Admiral, okay?

1348
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:09,924
All right. Things go wrong,
I'll see you back at the boat yard.

1349
01:17:09,926 --> 01:17:14,161
I'm gettin' a medal. I get to the Admiral,
I'm gettin' a medal. Watch.

1350
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:18,065
You're gonna wish
me luck, aren't ya?

1351
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:19,400
Come on, man,
let's hear it! Good luck.

1352
01:17:19,402 --> 01:17:21,168

what's the problem? (GRUNTS)

1359
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,433
Shit, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do that to you, man.

1360
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,102
Sir. (PANTING)

1361
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:58,239
I've never stepped foot in an officers' mess,
much less crashed it.

1362
01:17:58,241 --> 01:17:59,807
Please, sir,
it's an emergency.

1363
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:01,976
Stand outside, please.

1364
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:06,313
Leave us alone.
Thank you, sir.

1365
01:18:06,315 --> 01:18:10,017
I didn't mean to hit you like that.
I apologize.

1366
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:12,186
I'm listening,
sailor. Sit.

1367
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,287
Thank you, sir.

1368
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,261
QUINCE: Try the Admiral again for me.
RECEPTIONIST: Yes, sir.

1369
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:38,713
ADMIRAL: And you believed
this stolen money

1370
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:42,016
would all be used
to fight drug cartels?

1371
01:18:42,018 --> 01:18:44,452
Yes, sir. I thought the orders came
down the valid chain of command.

1372
01:18:44,454 --> 01:18:46,754
Blind loyalty
is not loyalty.

1373
01:18:46,756 --> 01:18:48,489
I know that, sir,
and that's why I'm here.

1374
01:18:48,491 --> 01:18:50,424
Well, you've shown
a lot of tenacity

1375
01:18:50,426 --> 01:18:52,727
and a lot of guts
bringing this to me.

1376
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:55,262
Thank you, sir.
That means the world comin' from you.

1377
01:18:55,264 --> 01:18:59,500
Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do for you.

1378
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:01,736
Of course, sir. I mean,
you can just lock down the base.

1379
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:03,170
You can arrest
Commander Quince.

1380
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:06,173
The United States Navy
does not rob banks.

1381
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:08,375
Its personnel
did not rob a bank.

1382
01:19:08,377 --> 01:19:12,213
I'm not gonna tarnish the integrity
of the Navy over one crooked sailor.

1383
01:19:12,215 --> 01:19:13,781
If there was money
taken from the bank

1384
01:19:13,783 --> 01:19:16,917
that was part of
an illegal CIA slush fund,

1385
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:19,253
the Navy had no knowledge
the fund existed.

1386
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,457
Your jacket has you
six months AWOL?

1387
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:24,992
Yes, sir.

1388
01:19:24,994 --> 01:19:26,794
It's gonna stay that way.

1389
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:33,367
Commander Quince's jacket will likewise
be amended so he's also AWOL,

1390
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:36,036
making none of this
the Navy's problem.

1391
01:19:36,038 --> 01:19:37,938
Sir, this isn't right.

1392
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,040
Well, I'd offer more,

1393
01:19:40,042 --> 01:19:41,275
but when the hand
has gangrene,

1394
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:44,245
you chop it off
to save the body.

1395
01:19:44,247 --> 01:19:47,982
You don't keep the pinkie around
just because it meant well.

1396
01:19:56,525 --> 01:20:00,361
Have Petty Officer Stigman
dropped outside the main gate.

1397
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:04,265
He sets foot on a military base anywhere in the world,

1398
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:07,268
I want him shot.

1399
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:11,138
You know,
men like me fight and die on the orders of men like you!

1400
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,841
Without us,
those stars on your shoulder are a fucking costume!

1401
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:33,828
Open the safe.

1402
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:34,895
Does your boss know
you're doin' this?

1403
01:20:34,897 --> 01:20:38,165
Or did the CIA kill her
like they did Jessup?

1404
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:40,401
