1
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,491
Come, come.

2
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:11,038
You have authorization
to dress him like that?

3
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:12,870
Oh, yes, sir.

4
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,876
Circus ape, huh?

5
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,145
The only one ever to have been
trained as a bareback rider

6
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:21,326
in the entire history of the circus.

7
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:23,329
Circuses are past history .

8
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:25,593
Not while I live and breathe.

9
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,636
Go ahead, Senor Armando.

10
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,638
Thank you.
Come, come.

11
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:46,658
Come, come.

12
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:57,310
- Did I do all right?
- Yes, yes, yes.

13
00:03:57,378 --> 00:03:59,870
But walk more like
a primitive chimpanzee.

14
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:04,183
Your arms should move
from the shoulder, like so.

15
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:07,682
Yes, that's better.

16
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,027
After 20 years,
you've picked up evolved habits from me.

17
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,933
That could be dangerous.
Even fatal.

18
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:16,938
Armando, I don't understand.

19
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:21,536
Caesar, there can be only one
talking chimpanzee on Earth,

20
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:24,742
the child of the two talking apes,
Cornelius and Zira,

21
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:28,585
who came from the future
and were brutally murdered

22
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:32,423
for fear that one very distant day
apes might dominate the human race.

23
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:36,455
But outside of you,
nobody even knows I exist.

24
00:04:36,533 --> 00:04:39,264
We must keep it that way.

25
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:43,105
The mere fact of your existence would be
regarded as a great threat to mankind.

26
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:44,575
- I--
- Shh!

27
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:47,274
Come, come.

28
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:03,605
Attention.
This is the watch commander.

29
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:06,268
Attention.
This is the watch commander.

30
00:05:06,342 --> 00:05:09,710
Disperse apes gathering in the mall.

31
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,274
Repeat. Disperse apes
gathering in the mall.

32
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:17,723
Take the serial number of each offender
and notify Ape Control immediately.

33
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:19,350
Repeat.

34
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:23,559
Take these rial number of each offender
and notify Ape Control immediately.

35
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:26,569
Their masters
are to be cited and fined.

36
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:28,071
Repeat.

37
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,042
Their masters
are to be cited and fined.

38
00:06:19,177 --> 00:06:22,148
Attention, attention.
This is the watch commander.

39
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,149
Attention, attention.

40
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:28,121
Disperse unauthorized
ape gathering at ramp six.

41
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,524
Repeat, disperse
unauthorized ape gathering

42
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:33,529
at the foot of ramp six.

43
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:36,864
No citation or fine
in this instance.

44
00:06:36,936 --> 00:06:39,098
Repeat.
No citation or fine.

45
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:41,368
But how did it happen?

46
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,876
Shh.

47
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:50,887
Go!

48
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:52,924
Go!

49
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:54,186
No!

50
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,591
No!

51
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:57,028
Aah!

52
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:07,207
Go.
You go.

53
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:15,184
But you said humans
treated apes like pets.

54
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:18,527
They did, in the beginning.

55
00:07:18,595 --> 00:07:20,996
- They've made slaves of them.
- Shh!

56
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:33,448
They all died eight years ago,
every dog and cat in the world.

57
00:07:33,516 --> 00:07:35,450
It was like a plague.

58
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:38,455
The disease that killed them
was a mysterious virus

59
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:40,992
brought back from outer space
by one of the astronauts.

60
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,995
- Didn't the disease affect humans?
- No, no, we were immune.

61
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,998
And so were simians,
even the smallest.

62
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:48,000
That's how it began--

63
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:52,234
humans wanting little pets
to replace those they'd lost.

64
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:56,076
When people realized
how quick they were to learn,

65
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:58,082
how easy to train,

66
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,087
the pets became larger and larger

67
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:04,716
until now...

68
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,954
It's monstrous.

69
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:14,028
Now you understand
why I've kept you away.

70
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:16,074
Yes, Lisa.

71

Yes?

75

Could you be so kind
as to display it in your window?

76
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,525
- When I have the time.
- Thank you.

Thank you, Frank.

Now that I know
they won't kill me,

85
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:32,074
I don't enjoy them.

86
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:37,406
Well, for heaven's sakes, a circus.

Oh, I was wondering,

91
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:31,222
would you be kind enough
to display these posters?

I'll comb you out in a minute.

97
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:45,302
I want to be combed out now.
I have to go to a luncheon.

98
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,607
Thursday, then.

99
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,273
Thursday.

Oh, I'm out of raisins.

- Take mine.

He's a performing ape for my circus.

- No!

00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,319
It's the only way.

168
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:35,629
I'll say I couldn't find you,

169
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:39,901
that, uh, you've run away before,
that big cities frighten you.

170
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:42,911
- But where would I go?
- You wait right here.

171
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:46,245
- If this works,
I'll be back by nightfall.
- But what if it doesn't?

172
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:49,844
- What if they don't let you go?
- They will. They will.

173
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:55,824
But just in case,
if I am not back by then,

174
00:14:55,897 --> 00:15:00,336
these steps go down to a tunnel
that leads to the harbor.

175
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:03,567
Cargoes of apes
are frequently unloaded at night.

176
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:06,702
You must infiltrate
one of them.

177
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:09,612
Apes imported from overseas
arrive naked.

178
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:12,346
- You'll have to
get rid of these clothes.
- I don't want to.

179
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,356
We must have an alternate plan.
Don't you see?

180
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:21,793
Right now,
the only safe hiding place for you

181
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:23,801
is among your own kind.

182
00:15:38,456 --> 00:15:40,391
I shouldn't be long.

183
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:55,921
Why would you say "human"?

184
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:59,192
That's a very odd thing
for another human being to say.

185
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:02,497
I didn't say "human," Mr. Governor.
I said "inhuman."

186
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,504
"Lousy inhuman bastards."

187
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:08,407
And by the blessed St. Francis,
who loved all animals, I meant it.

188
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:10,412
I run a circus, and--

189
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,642
- We know that.
- From 20 years back.

190
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:14,652
From the year, Senor Armando,

191
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,747
when the two talking apes
arrived and conceived a baby

192
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:21,557
whose survival could have threatened
the future of the entire human race.

193
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,590
Mr. Governor, it's my understanding
the baby was shot dead.

194
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:27,637
Or so it was believed.

195
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:29,639
However, ever since this morning

196
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:33,235
I'm beginning to wonder
if they shot the right baby.

197
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:36,875
They could have switched their baby
with one from a zoo.

198
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:38,852
Or perhaps a circus.

199
00:16:38,921 --> 00:16:40,616
Surely you can't be serious.

200
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:44,718
Hoskyns, the cassette, please.

201
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:49,301
This is a recording
of the recommendations

202
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:52,532
made to the then president
of the United States

203
00:16:52,606 --> 00:16:55,941
by the chairman of
the presidential committee.

204
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:03,378
We believe that the talking apes,
Cornelius and Zira,

205
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,514
have come from the future.

206
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,822
We believe their spoken testimony

207
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:10,261
thatsome2,000yearshence,

208
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:14,793
their descendants will have
all but exterminated the human race.

209
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:18,639
The female ape
is now pregnant with child.

210
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,612
The commission therefore recommends

211
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:27,086
that the ape child's birth
should be prevented,

212
00:17:27,154 --> 00:17:30,147
and that both the male and the female

213
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:34,027
should be rendered incapable
of begetting another.

214
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:42,808
But, Mr. Governor, every zoo, public
and private, was searched by the police,

215
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:44,845
and every circus,
including my own.

216
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:46,848
Where a small chimpanzee was found.

217
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,852
The only chimpanzee
ever to be born in a circus,

218
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,515
and legally certified
to have been born

219
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:57,154
a month before the talking apes
arrived on earth.

220
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,165
- Where is he now?
- I wish I knew.

221
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:02,397
- I've searched everywhere.
- Senor Armando!

222
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:05,739
Let me remind you

223
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:09,941
of the seriousness
of our problem.

224
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:14,043
Now, your circus travels
mainly in the provinces?

225
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,850
Yes, sir.

226
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:17,915
Undoubtedly, you are unaware

227
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:21,691
of the rising tide of disobedience
and outright defiance

228
00:18:21,764 --> 00:18:26,328
among the servant apes
in our cities.

229
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:29,807
Mr. Governor, many of the reported
offenses have been proved minor.

230
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:33,369
That ape who was killed while trying
to escape from the city last night,

231
00:18:33,448 --> 00:18:35,280
would you call his offense minor?

232
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:37,047
No, I would not.

233
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,749
He physically assaulted his own master.

234
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:42,259
But only after what must
have been severe provocation.

235
00:18:42,327 --> 00:18:46,628
The ape's body was covered
with bruises from a beating.

236
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:49,829
Which he no doubt richly deserved.

237
00:18:49,904 --> 00:18:54,137
How many more out there
are just like that ape,

238
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,806
all burning with resentment,

239
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:59,715
all waiting for an ape
with enough intelligence,

240
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:02,414
with enough will to lead them?

Waiting for an ape
who can think, who can talk.

242
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:14,232
Senor Armando,
has your ape ever talked

243
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:17,833
or shown any signs
of being articulate?

244
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,345
Never in my presence
or anyone else's.

00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:22,747

I assembled that data, Morgan.
You summarized the wrong part.

has increased about the same percentage,

You're quite right,
Mr. MacDonald,

but not for any of your
bleeding-heart reasons.

381
00:33:44,683 --> 00:33:47,882
Reconditioning.
That's all you ever think of.

382
00:33:47,955 --> 00:33:52,188
If we took every ape who muffed
an assignment or disobeyed an order

and sent him back

the latest ape disobedience figures.

487
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:03,209
There's been a marked increase
in property damage.

488
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:05,908
It couldn't all be carelessness,
Mr. MacDonald.

489
00:44:05,983 --> 00:44:09,216
Arrange for distribution
of the Achilles' List,

490
00:44:09,288 --> 00:44:11,723
copies to each police precinct.

491
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:15,228
Details are to be left
to the individual commanders,
but I want every ape on that list

492
00:44:15,296 --> 00:44:20,133
rounded up and delivered to
the reconditioning center
by 0600 tomorrow morning.

493
00:44:20,203 --> 00:44:23,230
I'm sorry , 309.
The cages are full.

494
00:44:23,307 --> 00:44:26,243
We cannot accommodate any new intakes

495
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:28,473
until after Tuesday's auction.

496
00:44:28,547 --> 00:44:31,244
I repeat that.
After Tuesday's auction.

497
00:44:36,626 --> 00:44:40,723
"Collect one repaired Colt .45."

498
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:43,768
Add...

499
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:49,572
1 00 rounds ammunition.

500
00:44:56,154 --> 00:45:00,615
The Achilles' List,
referring to our Achilles' heel,

501
00:45:00,692 --> 00:45:03,561
contains the name of every ape
who over the past year

502
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:05,758
has been guilty of overt disobedience.

503
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:11,001
- The charge against them is nonsense.
- It will do for my purposes.

504
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:15,240
They constitute the hard core of our
problem, and I'm going to crush them.

505
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:18,751
You will only further
aggravate the problem.

506
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:24,020
This action is folly,
and I wish to protest it
in the strongest possible terms.

507
00:45:24,093 --> 00:45:26,528
Very well, Mr. MacDonald.

508
00:45:26,596 --> 00:45:29,725
Your protest has been duly noted.

509
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,501
From now on, you have one assignment--
to find that talking ape.

What is this?
A red alert?

513
00:45:51,364 --> 00:45:52,798
Sort of.

00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:57,202
Ape Management computer's
come up with a rather intriguing error.

Shipment 507-l for Indonesia

516
00:45:59,775 --> 00:46:02,210
comprised three orangutans
and one chimpanzee.

517
00:46:02,279 --> 00:46:03,770
So?

518
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:07,751
There are no chimpanzees in Borneo.

519
00:46:07,821 --> 00:46:09,846
Yes, sir. One moment.

520
00:46:09,923 --> 00:46:12,358
State Security Chief Inspector Kolp
on line three.

521
00:46:12,426 --> 00:46:13,860
Yes, Inspector?

522
00:46:13,929 --> 00:46:17,867
Give me the Indonesian file
for last month.

523
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:21,531
That's 507 ex-Borneo.

524
00:46:21,606 --> 00:46:23,871
Right, Inspector.
Let me check.

525
00:46:23,943 --> 00:46:27,346
507 ex-Borneo.
Yes, sir.

526
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:29,576
That chimpanzee was sold
to Governor Breck.

527
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:31,586
Just as I first thought!

528
00:46:31,654 --> 00:46:34,590
We've had him under our noses
all the time!

529
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:38,562
I'll have the ape executed immediately
on your verbal orders alone.

530
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,997
- You'll have it in writing.
- Thank you, sir.

531
00:46:41,067 --> 00:46:43,730
Get Mr. MacDonald
at the command post.

532
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:45,796
Suppose he won't speak?

533
00:46:45,874 --> 00:46:47,843
I don't understand.

534
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:51,347
What the chief inspector means is,
there'd still be a doubt.

535
00:46:51,415 --> 00:46:54,408
If the chimpanzee keeps his mouth shut,
the case stays open.

536
00:46:54,486 --> 00:46:56,579
We'd like to close the file.

537
00:46:56,655 --> 00:46:59,751
You shall.

What kind of disturbance?

540
00:47:05,802 --> 00:47:10,036
MacDonald speaking.
Yes, sir.

541
00:47:10,108 --> 00:47:13,977
You want me to turn
Caesar over to Kolp?

542
00:47:14,046 --> 00:47:16,607
He's on your Achilles' List?

543
00:47:16,684 --> 00:47:20,382
Mr. MacDonald,
do not question an order.

544
00:47:20,456 --> 00:47:23,255
No, I'm not questioning the orders.

545
00:47:25,263 --> 00:47:29,167
I sent him out on an errand.
He should be back momentarily.

546
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:34,565
Yes, sir.
I'll do just as you say.

547
00:47:47,394 --> 00:47:48,656
Come.

are you near a phone?

554
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,733
Mr. MacDonald,
it is imperative

555
00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:24,904
that you get to a phone.

556
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,787
Come in, Mr. MacDonald.
Do you hear me?

557
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:33,298
Get to a phone and come in.

558
00:48:34,367 --> 00:48:36,302
Now come in.

559
00:48:39,074 --> 00:48:40,473
Yes, Mr. Governor?

560
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,807
Kelp is on his way.

561
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,508
- Is Caesar back yet?
- Not yet, sir.

562
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:49,520
- I'll keep a lookout.
- Notify me the moment he's handed over.

563
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,023
Yes, sir.

564
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:12,115
I wish...

565
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:16,625
I wish there was some way we could
communicate so you'd understand that l--

566
00:49:20,365 --> 00:49:23,494
I understand,

567
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:25,504
Mr. MacDonald.

568
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:34,640
Yes, l--

569
00:49:34,718 --> 00:49:37,244
I'm the one they're looking for.

570
00:49:47,337 --> 00:49:51,274
I never believed it.
I thought you were a myth.

571
00:49:51,342 --> 00:49:55,007
Well, I'm not.

572
00:49:55,081 --> 00:49:58,017
But I will tell you
something that is.

573
00:49:58,085 --> 00:50:00,520
The belief that
human beings are kind.

574
00:50:00,588 --> 00:50:02,580
No, Caesar.
There are some--

575
00:50:02,658 --> 00:50:05,594
A handful, perhaps, but not most.

576
00:50:05,662 --> 00:50:09,532
They won't learn to be kind
until we force them to.

577
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:13,538
We can't do that
until we are free.

578
00:50:13,606 --> 00:50:17,544
How do you propose
to gain this freedom?

579
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:22,244
By the only means left to us--
revolution.

580
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,914
But it's doomed to failure.

581
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,890
Perhaps.

582
00:50:26,959 --> 00:50:28,756
- This time.
- And the next.

583
00:50:28,827 --> 00:50:31,730
- Maybe.
- But you'll keep trying.

584

You above every one else
should understand.

585
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:39,575
We cannot be free
until we have power.

586
00:50:39,643 --> 00:50:43,478
How else can we achieve it?

587
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:53,693
Go!

588
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:11,714
Mr. MacDonald, I have an order to have
the ape Caesar taken into custody.

589
00:51:11,788 --> 00:51:13,723
I know.
I've been looking for him.

590
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,816
- He's not in the command post?
- No.

591

It's really quite simple.

596
00:53:15,895 --> 00:53:18,091
The ape has intelligence.

597
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:20,464
He learned Armando was dead.

598
00:53:20,535 --> 00:53:23,937
He assumed the man
betrayed him under torture.

against flame throwers?

815
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:10,555
Where there is fire, there is smoke.

816
01:22:10,626 --> 01:22:15,122
And, in that smoke,
from this day forward,

817
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:20,731
my people will crouch
and conspire and plot and plan

818
01:22:20,807 --> 01:22:23,972
for the inevitable day
of man's downfall,

819
01:22:24,046 --> 01:22:27,949
the day when he finally
and self-destructively

820
01:22:28,017 --> 01:22:30,782
turns his weapons against his own kind,

821
01:22:30,854 --> 01:22:33,916
the day of the writing in the sky

822
01:22:33,993 --> 01:22:37,361
when your cities lie buried
under radioactive rubble,

823
01:22:37,431 --> 01:22:39,423
when the sea is a dead sea,

824
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,833
and the land is a wasteland

825
01:22:41,904 --> 01:22:46,883
out of which I will lead my people
from their captivity.

826
01:22:47,017 --> 01:22:51,854
We shall build our own cities in which
there will be no place for humans

827
01:22:51,924 --> 01:22:54,416
except to serve our ends.

828
01:22:54,494 --> 01:22:58,626
We shall found our own armies,
our own religion,

829
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,497
our own dynasty.

830
01:23:00,569 --> 01:23:05,372
That day is upon you now!

831
01:23:56,014 --> 01:23:59,382
N-N-N-No!

832
01:24:01,488 --> 01:24:04,014
N-N-N...

833
01:24:07,029 --> 01:24:10,057
But now...

834
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:14,196
now we will put away our hatred.

835
01:24:14,272 --> 01:24:19,109
Now we will put down our weapons.

836
01:24:21,116 --> 01:24:24,986
We have passed through
the night of the fires,

837
01:24:26,356 --> 01:24:29,520
and those who were our masters

838
01:24:29,595 --> 01:24:32,622
are now our servants!

839
01:24:32,699 --> 01:24:36,967
And we, who are not human,

840
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:41,772
can afford to be humane.

841
01:24:41,844 --> 01:24:44,974
Destiny is the will of God,

842
01:24:45,049 --> 01:24:50,045
and if it is man's destiny
to be dominated,

843
01:24:50,123 --> 01:24:52,422
it is God's will

844
01:24:52,493 --> 01:24:57,296
that he be dominated with compassion

845
01:24:57,367 --> 01:25:00,360
and understanding.

846
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:06,302
So cast out your vengeance.

847
01:25:08,048 --> 01:25:11,212
Tonight we have seen

848
01:25:11,286 --> 01:25:15,122
the birth of the planet of the apes!

849
01:25:15,192 --> 01:25:17,184
