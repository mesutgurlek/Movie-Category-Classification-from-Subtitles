Sure, you betcha.

328

I told you that upteen times.

329
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:47,455
A guy in a rubber-type boat was headed
for the Goodhue place, you know?

330
00:27:47,522 --> 00:27:49,490
Yeah, sure, yeah.

331
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:51,185
Okay then?

332
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:53,227
Sure, after how many beers?

333
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:56,958
I ain't touched a drop of liquor
since I quit singing with ABBA.

334
00:27:57,032 --> 00:28:00,661
Was that the night of
the Hibbing Goodhue murder?

-You seem awful interested in this case.
-No.

about the Goodhue killing?
- No.

- Do you have any real stories
to tell us?
- No.

338
00:28:09,144 --> 00:28:12,341

and write a check here.

- What are you doing here?

- How did you get in?
- The door was open.

371

I locked that door.

372

A key.

373

Lauren is missing. She gave you a key,
sent you to do evidence housecleaning.

No, I painted Hibbing's portrait.

He gave me this key to let myself in.

00:31:40,955 --> 00:31:43,423
I have no idea where Lauren is.
The killer could be stalking her.

377
00:31:43,491 --> 00:31:46,688
Stalking, schmalking. She lied
about me on the witness stand.

378
00:31:46,761 --> 00:31:48,786
She set me up to come here
the night of the murder.

379
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,296
She couldn't do anything like that.

Coulda, woulda, shoulda.
She dida!

I understand her.
You see, I think she's my sister.

Sister?

383
00:31:58,173 --> 00:32:00,539
It's like a brother,
only you do each other's hair.

384
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:03,702
I think she's in grave danger.
I came to look for clues.

385
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:06,804
Ryan, I know you're innocent.

another way to meet guys?

No.

Now all I've got
is a one-way ticket to Palookaville.

is here somewhere.

about the bartender.

That was Hibbing's money
for the portrait.

I gave it to the bartender
to give back to Hibbing.
