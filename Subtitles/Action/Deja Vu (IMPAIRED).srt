For her to have washed up

00:26:33,832 --> 00:26:37,029
She washed up before the explosion
and against the tide.

- Do you have a scenario?
- Yes, I do.

315
00:26:40,272 --> 00:26:44,038
I believe that somebody abducted her
in her home, taped her mouth,

316
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:46,940
bound her wrists, burned her alive,
dumped her in the river

317
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:50,071
so she would appear to be
just another disaster victim.

318
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,641
A disaster that hadn't happened yet.

319

that the bomber came in direct contact
with the victim.

It's a tan and red Bronco.

is that we have exactly one look
at any one time.

00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:43,285
we can look anywhere

Always. You understand?

It's like a single trailing moment of now,

421
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:59,494
Okay. So if you can't move forward
or backward in time,

422
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:01,574
how is it the image keeps
speeding up like that?

423
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:04,906
It's not the image that's moving faster,
it's just our shifting point of view.

424
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:07,775
The passage of time remains constant,
but we can shift our point of view

425
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:10,111

00:45:50,212 --> 00:45:52,009
<i>See, I need the vehicle
Tuesday morning.</i>

622
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:54,776
<i>Is there anyone else there
that can show me the car?</i>

623
00:45:54,883 --> 00:45:56,578
<i>- No. Sorry.
- He's thinking.</i>

624
00:45:56,685 --> 00:45:58,175
<i>I'll tell you what. There's a K5 Blazer...</i>

625
00:45:58,286 --> 00:46:00,083
A date means
somebody's gonna be expecting her

626
00:46:00,188 --> 00:46:01,746
and will miss her
if she doesn't show up.

627
00:46:01,857 --> 00:46:04,052
That could ruin his plans.
Shanti, I want to see this guy.

628
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,595
No good. It's an outdoor phone booth.
Three miles out of range.

629
00:46:08,263 --> 00:46:09,753
<i>CLAIRE: I hope to hear from you.</i>

630
00:46:09,865 --> 00:46:12,925
Can we get someone out there
with a goggle rig?

631
00:46:15,504 --> 00:46:17,438
What's that do? Extend the range?

632
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:19,404
Yeah, it's immediate line of sight.

633
00:46:19,508 --> 00:46:22,102
But we can use it to gather data
outside the target area.

634
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,541
Provided there's any data to gather.

635
00:46:23,645 --> 00:46:25,306
How long is this guy
gonna be at the phone booth?

636
00:46:25,413 --> 00:46:26,710
Not long.

637
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,407
<i>- Have a good night.
- Thanks.</i>

638
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:29,484
<i>Bye.</i>

639
00:46:30,786 --> 00:46:32,219
<i>Story of my life.</i>

640
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,878
Yeah, story of my life, too.

641
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:35,889
All right, now we heard
the voice of our bomber,

642
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:37,788
now we're gonna go after him
the old-fashioned way.

643
00:46:37,893 --> 00:46:40,088
Can we get video surveillance
on that phone booth?

644
00:46:40,195 --> 00:46:43,392
We can access all surveillance
available to any government agency.

645
00:46:51,206 --> 00:46:53,766
Okay, this is from the ATM camera
across the street.

646
00:46:55,877 --> 00:47:00,439
All right. Let's fast-forward to the exact
time of his phone call to Claire.

647
00:47:03,952 --> 00:47:05,419
Where are we supposed to be looking?

648
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,283
Behind the guy on the left.

649
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,383
Can you enhance it, Gunnars?

650
00:47:11,726 --> 00:47:13,626
GUNNARS: Not enough for an ID.

651
00:47:16,331 --> 00:47:18,959
Wait, go back.
Can you rewind it just a little bit?

652
00:47:19,067 --> 00:47:21,558
Stop. What is that on the ground?

653
00:47:23,605 --> 00:47:25,732
Looks like a camcorder bag, maybe.

654
00:47:25,841 --> 00:47:28,537
- We have facial recognition software?
- Yeah.

655
00:47:28,643 --> 00:47:29,837
Let's use it on the bag.

656
00:47:29,945 --> 00:47:32,345
Cross-match it to all the bags
on the south side of the city

657
00:47:32,447 --> 00:47:35,314
in the 48 hours leading up
to the explosion, all right?

658
00:47:38,453 --> 00:47:40,080
GUNNARS: Don't think it's ever been
used this way.

659
00:47:40,188 --> 00:47:42,383
Yeah, that's kind of a simple image
to go for a match.

660
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:44,355
Well, we got nowhere else to go.

661
00:47:48,797 --> 00:47:51,493
- PRYZWARRA: Look, same bag.
- Bingo.

662
00:47:57,806 --> 00:47:59,171
Okay, freeze it.

663
00:48:01,476 --> 00:48:04,001
Yeah, looks like the same guy, too.
Where is this?

664
00:48:04,112 --> 00:48:06,512
Security camera
at the Algiers ferry dock.

665
00:48:06,615 --> 00:48:08,014
Okay, when is this?

666
00:48:08,116 --> 00:48:11,574
Two nights before the explosion.
Seven hours from now.

667
00:48:12,254 --> 00:48:14,449
Two nights before the explosion
is seven hours from now?

668
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:18,754
Seven hours from now, we will be able
to access this point in our time window.

669
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:20,054
CARLIN: Gotcha.

670
00:48:28,837 --> 00:48:33,035
Kind of creepy, seeing that lady's life
go down in flames.

671
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:34,565
Yep.

672
00:48:35,343 --> 00:48:37,334
Makes you appreciate life.

673
00:48:38,346 --> 00:48:40,974
I suggest you go home
and jump on whoever you got.

674
00:48:41,082 --> 00:48:43,676
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- Nobody home.

675
00:48:43,885 --> 00:48:45,876
How'd you let that happen?

676
00:48:47,889 --> 00:48:51,552
Everything you have, you lose, right?
Mother, father, gone.

677
00:48:52,093 --> 00:48:54,288
Good looks, Pryzwarra, gone.

678
00:48:55,063 --> 00:48:56,792
Loved ones gone in a second.

679
00:48:56,898 --> 00:48:59,230
That's what this job teaches you,
doesn't it?

680
00:48:59,334 --> 00:49:00,926
No matter what,

681
00:49:01,336 --> 00:49:05,136
no matter how hard you grab
onto something, you still lose it, right?

682
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:08,903
Well, we're gonna grab onto this guy
in a couple hours.

683
00:49:09,444 --> 00:49:11,935
We're gonna nail this son of a bitch.

684
00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:15,382
What's wrong?

685
00:49:18,253 --> 00:49:20,653
No matter what, we still lose her.

686
00:49:23,091 --> 00:49:24,217
Right?

708
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:32,383
- What the hell's going on?
- Shanti, are we back online?

709
00:50:32,494 --> 00:50:33,791
SHANTI: I don't know.
Something broached the field.

710
00:50:33,895 --> 00:50:36,329
- What broached the field?
- That broached the field, right there.

711
00:50:36,431 --> 00:50:39,127
That broached the field, right there.
That's what broached the field.

712
00:50:39,234 --> 00:50:41,225
Now, you wanna tell me
what the hell this thing is?

713
00:50:41,336 --> 00:50:44,737
It's not surveillance, Paul.
It's not electronic thermal imaging.

714
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:47,501
You guys have figured out a way
to look into the past. Yes or no?

715
00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:48,576
- No.
- You're lying.

716
00:50:48,676 --> 00:50:51,144
- You're lying, and you know it.
- I've told you everything I can.

717
00:50:51,246 --> 00:50:53,976
She saw it, Paul.
I pointed this thing at her just now,

718
00:50:54,082 --> 00:50:56,778
and she responded to it
from four and a half days ago.

719
00:50:56,885 --> 00:50:59,149
- Explain that to me.
- All right.

720
00:50:59,521 --> 00:51:01,455
CARLIN: Somebody explain it!

721
00:51:03,124 --> 00:51:04,614
Hit it, Shanti.

722
00:51:06,761 --> 00:51:08,092
For three years,
Cambridge has been working

723
00:51:08,196 --> 00:51:10,187
for National Reconnaissance
on an R & D grant.

724
00:51:10,298 --> 00:51:11,356
Okay.

725
00:51:11,466 --> 00:51:13,866
We were attempting
to use concentrated bursts of energy

726
00:51:13,968 --> 00:51:16,402
to enhance the sensitivity
of optical telescopes.

727
00:51:16,504 --> 00:51:17,903
In the process, we had a breakthrough.

728
00:51:18,006 --> 00:51:20,440
Given enough energy,
we could warp the very fabric of space.

729
00:51:20,542 --> 00:51:23,102
I said explain it to me, not talk science.

730
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:24,838
- They found a way to...
- Look, I'll tell you what.

731
00:51:24,946 --> 00:51:27,608
Why don't you guys just keep talking?
I'll just sit here

732
00:51:27,715 --> 00:51:29,842
until you figure out
what it is you really wanna tell me.

733
00:51:29,951 --> 00:51:33,011
They found a way
to fold space back onto itself.

734
00:51:34,923 --> 00:51:39,053
All right, look. We're used to viewing
space as flat, right?

735
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,149
- Like this piece of paper.
- Right.

736
00:51:40,261 --> 00:51:42,627
To see something from a distance,
light has always had to travel

737
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,288
the long way
across the flat space in between.

738
00:51:44,399 --> 00:51:45,798
But given what I was trying to explain,

739
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,664
we can fold the space,
bring the target closer to us,

740
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,601
create what's known as
an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

741
00:51:50,705 --> 00:51:53,731
otherwise known as a wormhole,
suspend it via gravitational field.

742
00:51:53,842 --> 00:51:55,070
- That's what we're looking at?
- That's it.

743
00:51:55,176 --> 00:51:57,110
What's on the other end of the bridge?

744
00:51:57,212 --> 00:51:58,736
Claire's house.

745
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:01,739
Wow.

746
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,909
Basically, we're folding space
in a higher dimension

747
00:52:04,018 --> 00:52:06,680
to create an instantaneous link
between two distant points.

748
00:52:06,788 --> 00:52:08,779
- Instantaneous?
- Well, that's what we hoped for

749
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:11,120
and that's what we expected.
But the electrical force...

750
00:52:11,226 --> 00:52:13,717
We used huge amounts of energy
to create this bridge.

751
00:52:13,828 --> 00:52:14,954
All right, how huge?

752
00:52:15,063 --> 00:52:17,156
You remember that little blackout
we had a few years back?

753
00:52:17,265 --> 00:52:18,323
- Yes, I do.
- New York blamed Canada.

754
00:52:18,433 --> 00:52:19,593
- Right.
- Canada blamed Michigan.

755
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:21,601
Half the Northeast.
You're saying you guys...

756
00:52:21,703 --> 00:52:23,728
- Fifty million homes. Right.
- My bad.

757
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:25,499
Well, I still say we blame Canada, but...

758
00:52:25,607 --> 00:52:27,973
Okay, so why can't I see this bridge?

759
00:52:28,076 --> 00:52:30,476
It's not visible to the human eye.
I mean, it's real, though.

760
00:52:30,578 --> 00:52:31,772
It's just as real and just as solid

761
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,279
as a cell phone signal or a radio wave.

762
00:52:33,381 --> 00:52:35,679
Right. Well, I don't know
how a cell phone works.

763
00:52:35,783 --> 00:52:39,378
I just know how to use it.
So how do we use this?

764
00:52:39,687 --> 00:52:41,052
We can look back four and a half days.

765
00:52:41,156 --> 00:52:43,989
- And what, we can look anywhere?
- Limited radius.

766
00:52:44,092 --> 00:52:46,151
Right, right, right.
Looking into the past.

767
00:52:46,261 --> 00:52:48,252
In a sense,
we're always looking in the past.

768
00:52:48,363 --> 00:52:50,991
Even light reflected
from yourself in the mirror

769
00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:52,566
takes some time to reflect back.

770
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:53,634
Let me get this straight.

771
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:57,569
You're trying to tell me
that on the other side of this bridge

772
00:52:58,039 --> 00:52:59,734
- is the actual past?
- Yes.

773
00:52:59,841 --> 00:53:01,240
- Wow.
- DENNY: Yeah. But look, look, look.

774
00:53:01,342 --> 00:53:03,469
We created this thing by pure accident.
All right?

775
00:53:03,578 --> 00:53:08,106
This space and time...
This time window is a complete fluke.

776
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:12,215
All right? And everybody is terrified
of screwing with it for fear of losing it

777
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,447
or suffering the consequences
of God knows what,

778
00:53:14,556 --> 00:53:16,547
which is why it can only be used
as a retroactive tool...

779
00:53:16,658 --> 00:53:18,785
Hey, let me ask you something.
Is she alive or is she dead?

780
00:53:18,893 --> 00:53:20,451
- You went to her funeral, Doug.
- I know that,

781
00:53:20,562 --> 00:53:23,554
but I think the question still applies.
Is she alive or is she dead?

782
00:53:23,665 --> 00:53:27,362
All right. Life, like time and space,
is not merely a local phenomenon.

783
00:53:27,468 --> 00:53:28,833
All right!

784
00:53:30,138 --> 00:53:32,003
Am I asking a hard question?

785
00:53:32,106 --> 00:53:34,574
[CLEARS THROAT] Looks like I picked
a bad week to stop snorting hash.

786
00:53:34,676 --> 00:53:35,870
All right, I tell you what.

787
00:53:35,977 --> 00:53:40,505
I'll speak slow, so those of you with
Ph.D.'s in the room can understand.

788
00:53:40,648 --> 00:53:42,843
It... Here. Look. Here's a monitor, right?

789
00:53:45,853 --> 00:53:48,879
Now the monitor is broken. It's dead.

790
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:52,790
It is not temporarily transitioned
to another state of entropy.

791
00:53:52,894 --> 00:53:58,059
It's dead, right?
Now, is she alive or is she dead?

792
00:53:58,233 --> 00:53:59,632
- She's alive.
- All right.

793
00:53:59,734 --> 00:54:00,701
Now we're getting somewhere.

794
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:02,770
All right, now, you said
light could go back. What else?

795
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:04,428
- Nothing.
- Something else could be sent back.

796
00:54:04,539 --> 00:54:06,530
Come on, Paul. Something.
What? A body? A human being?

797
00:54:06,641 --> 00:54:08,734
- No.
- Not a person. Not alive, anyway.

798
00:54:08,843 --> 00:54:10,868
- Why not?
- Because you can't beat the physics.

799
00:54:10,979 --> 00:54:13,470
The electromagnetic field.
Look, you transition across

800
00:54:13,581 --> 00:54:15,412
what's known as
the Wheeler Boundary, all right?

801
00:54:15,516 --> 00:54:17,711
An EM pulse annihilates
all electrical activity.

802
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:19,753
That's your heartbeat,
that's brainwaves, that's everything.

803
00:54:19,854 --> 00:54:21,719
So what? You haven't tried a person?

804
00:54:21,823 --> 00:54:23,085
Let's just say
that we've done enough tests

805
00:54:23,191 --> 00:54:25,125
to know that it's not even possible.

806
00:54:25,226 --> 00:54:27,786
It's not even theoretically possible.
The hamster goes back, dead.

807
00:54:27,895 --> 00:54:30,090
- A drosophila fly, dead.
- What about a radio signal?

808
00:54:30,198 --> 00:54:31,426
What about that?
We could send a radio...

809
00:54:31,532 --> 00:54:32,692
- A radio signal?
- Yeah, a radio signal.

810
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,631
- Won't work. Electrical.
- The field would scramble it.

811
00:54:34,736 --> 00:54:37,102
- All right, then a note, a warning note.
- No.

812
00:54:37,205 --> 00:54:38,900
- A single piece of paper. One sheet.
- No.

813
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:40,440
- If we keep the mass low...
- No!

814
00:54:40,541 --> 00:54:41,633
This could work! It could work.

815
00:54:41,743 --> 00:54:42,971
Sure. We know
where the guy's gonna be.

816
00:54:43,077 --> 00:54:44,567
We can apprehend him
and put him away

817
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:45,668
before he even blows up the boat.

818
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,112
- And how do we do that, exactly?
- We send it to ourselves!

819
00:54:48,216 --> 00:54:50,741
You send it to me. Yeah, send it to me.
Send it to my office.

820
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:52,786
Send it to my office
four and a half days ago,

821
00:54:52,887 --> 00:54:56,015
an anonymous tip, and we can capture
this guy before he even meets Claire.

822
00:54:56,124 --> 00:54:57,921
We know he's gonna be at the dock.

823
00:54:58,026 --> 00:54:59,152
Whatever you did, you did it already.

824
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:02,058
Whether you send this note or you
don't send this note, it doesn't matter.

825
00:55:02,163 --> 00:55:05,098
You cannot change the past.
It's physically impossible.

826
00:55:05,633 --> 00:55:07,658
What if there's more than physics?

827
00:55:09,704 --> 00:55:11,934
Okay. Something spiritual, right?

828
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,838
- Yeah, something spiritual.
- Okay, okay, okay. Look.

829
00:55:14,942 --> 00:55:16,375
Just try to think of it this way.

830
00:55:16,477 --> 00:55:18,502
God's mind is made up about this.
All right?

831
00:55:18,613 --> 00:55:21,241
I mean, you know,
call it fate, call it destiny, whatever.

832
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:23,681
But it already happened,
it will keep happening,

833
00:55:23,785 --> 00:55:26,185
- and it always will happen.
- Maybe.

834
00:55:26,287 --> 00:55:28,551
And why don't we call it fate,
since we're calling it something?

835
00:55:28,656 --> 00:55:31,250
Maybe you're right. Maybe you guys
are exactly right. I don't know.

836
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:33,589
All I know is this. For all of my career,

837
00:55:33,695 --> 00:55:36,789
I've been trying to catch people
after they do something horrible.

838
00:55:36,898 --> 00:55:37,922
For once in my life,

839
00:55:38,032 --> 00:55:40,592
I'd like to catch somebody
before they do something horrible.

840
00:55:40,702 --> 00:55:42,567
All right? Can you understand that?

841
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:48,654
Address is in range.

842
00:55:48,689 --> 00:55:49,500
Address is in range.

843
00:55:54,482 --> 00:55:56,575
Two L's. "Surveilling," two L's.

844
00:55:58,052 --> 00:56:00,612
Since this is such a tremendous waste
of taxpayer money,

845
00:56:00,722 --> 00:56:02,280
the least we could do
is get the spelling right.

846
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:03,379
That's not necessarily true.

847
00:56:03,491 --> 00:56:05,186
Branching universe theory holds
that you can do...

848
00:56:05,293 --> 00:56:07,523
- Oh, branching universe theory.
- SHANTI: Look, hold it. All right.

849
00:56:07,628 --> 00:56:09,562
- No, no, no.
- I'll show you.

850
00:56:10,064 --> 00:56:11,827
The traditional view of time is linear,

851
00:56:11,933 --> 00:56:14,902
like a river flowing from the past
toward the future.

852
00:56:15,002 --> 00:56:16,993
But you can change
the course of a river, right?

853
00:56:17,105 --> 00:56:20,939
Exactly. Introduce a significant enough
event at any point in this river

854
00:56:21,042 --> 00:56:22,771
and you create a new branch,

855
00:56:22,877 --> 00:56:26,313
still flowing toward the future,
but along a different route.

856
00:56:26,414 --> 00:56:27,506
Changed.

857
00:56:27,615 --> 00:56:29,742
Yeah, but that river is the Mississippi,

858
00:56:29,851 --> 00:56:31,842
and we're lobbing
what amounts to a pebble into it.

859
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:35,320
That's a very few tiny ripples in a kind
of big body of water, don't you think?

860
00:56:35,423 --> 00:56:36,856
Traditionalist.

861
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,585
Say we do create this new branch.

862
00:56:38,693 --> 00:56:40,888
What happens to the old one?
To this one?

863
00:56:40,995 --> 00:56:42,553
Ask the radical.

864
00:56:43,498 --> 00:56:46,797
Well, it might continue
parallel to the new branch,

865
00:56:47,235 --> 00:56:49,294
but most likely it ceases to exist.

866
00:56:49,404 --> 00:56:51,895
The idea is, we cease to exist.

867
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:54,667
All right? This version of us, anyway.

868
00:56:55,343 --> 00:56:57,538
You know, we never came here.
We didn't meet Doug.

869
00:56:57,645 --> 00:57:00,136
We don't remember it ever happening.

870
00:57:00,248 --> 00:57:02,580
Well, that's worth $ 10 billion
right there.

871
00:57:07,555 --> 00:57:10,251
Would've been a lot faster
if you'd written it yourself.

872
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:12,223
Right. Then I recognize
my own handwriting

873
00:57:12,326 --> 00:57:14,317
and the universe blows up.

874
00:57:30,244 --> 00:57:31,268
We're ready.

875
00:57:31,379 --> 00:57:34,746
All right, third floor, southwest corner.
That's where we are.

876
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:37,907
<i>MINUTI: How'd you
get that information?</i>

877
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:39,043
<i>CARLIN: Good police work.</i>

878
00:57:39,153 --> 00:57:40,142
That's me. I can hear me.

879
00:57:40,254 --> 00:57:41,744
<i>- I don't wanna play games with you.
- Where am I?</i>

880
00:57:41,856 --> 00:57:43,118
<i>- I'm not playing games.
- Yeah, you are.</i>

881
00:57:43,224 --> 00:57:44,919
<i>- No, I'm not.
- There are protocols... Yeah, you are.</i>

882
00:57:45,026 --> 00:57:47,324
- There I am.
- Is that Minuti?

883
00:57:47,428 --> 00:57:49,293
<i>- There's procedures...
- Yep. That's my partner, Larry.</i>

884
00:57:49,397 --> 00:57:51,524
<i>Look, I know how this job works,
you know how this job works.</i>

885
00:57:51,632 --> 00:57:53,497
Jesus, I forgot all about this part.

886
00:57:53,601 --> 00:57:56,536
All right, let's find a nice, happy place
to push the note onto.

887
00:57:56,637 --> 00:57:58,502
- That your desk?
- Yeah, that's my...

888
00:57:58,606 --> 00:58:00,198
Okay. Line us up.

889
00:58:00,508 --> 00:58:04,069
<i>When I peg a guy on a hunch,
that's good police work,</i>

890
00:58:04,178 --> 00:58:07,170
<i>not some conspiracy
to keep you out of the loop, all right?</i>

891
00:58:07,281 --> 00:58:09,511
<i>- You know what, Doug?
- Okay, kid, start pushing.</i>

892
00:58:09,617 --> 00:58:10,879
Expand the wave past the note.

893
00:58:10,985 --> 00:58:12,748
<i>I can't watch your back
if you're holding out on me.</i>

894
00:58:12,854 --> 00:58:13,843
<i>Why not?</i>

895
00:58:13,955 --> 00:58:15,980
If my memory serves me right,
we better hurry up,

896
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,614
'cause I think I'm about to leave.

897
00:58:17,725 --> 00:58:19,420
- I need more cowbell.
- GUNNARS: I'm trying.

898
00:58:19,527 --> 00:58:20,858
<i>- Okay, well, I...
- Good!</i>

899
00:58:20,962 --> 00:58:21,929
Just give me a second.

900
00:58:22,029 --> 00:58:24,190
- Don't talk to each other.
- DENNY: Expand.

901
00:58:24,298 --> 00:58:25,287
I'm about to leave.

902
00:58:25,399 --> 00:58:27,026
<i>... another partner?
How about that? How about that?</i>

903
00:58:27,134 --> 00:58:28,726
<i>- Everybody relax.
- Okay. Yeah.</i>

904
00:58:28,836 --> 00:58:30,030
- Let's go.
- I'm working on it.

905
00:58:30,137 --> 00:58:31,798
Prepare for the final power surge.
Ready?

906
00:58:31,906 --> 00:58:35,171
<i>- Have a good vacation.
- All right. Go, go, go!</i>

907
00:58:36,844 --> 00:58:38,277
<i>Walk away.</i>

908
00:58:48,756 --> 00:58:49,780
PRYZWARRA:
What the hell happened?

909
00:58:49,891 --> 00:58:50,880
DENNY: I don't know.

910
00:58:50,992 --> 00:58:52,789
It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
Pull it back!

911
00:58:52,894 --> 00:58:54,521
- Did it go through?
- I don't know! I don't know!

912
00:58:54,662 --> 00:58:55,629
Pull it back.

913
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:05,700
- There it is.
- It went through.

914
00:59:05,806 --> 00:59:07,239
- That's right.
- It's through.

915
00:59:07,341 --> 00:59:08,535
PRYZWARRA: It went through!
SHANTI: Great.

916
00:59:08,643 --> 00:59:10,270
Whoa, whoa.
No, wait a minute. Hang on.

917
00:59:10,378 --> 00:59:12,403
It ain't great yet. I don't come back.

918
00:59:27,395 --> 00:59:30,159
Put it down, Larry. I'm not coming back.

you were rejected again.

1133
01:16:32,593 --> 01:16:34,857
Why do you think they did that?

1134
01:16:36,396 --> 01:16:38,762
Because they don't want patriots.

1135
01:16:39,466 --> 01:16:42,560
The military no longer recognizes
commitment and purpose.

1136
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:46,528
They thought I was overcommitted
and psychologically unstable.

They didn't want to understand
my value.

- No, well, something

- that couldn't be traced back to me.
- Right.

1161
01:17:55,825 --> 01:17:58,589
I had one ready till that cop showed up.

1162
01:17:59,228 --> 01:18:01,856
That cop was a federal agent.

1163
01:18:01,964 --> 01:18:04,330
Lawrence Minuti. My partner.
You shot him.

1164
01:18:04,433 --> 01:18:07,402
He... I was about to burn him
and he was waking up, you know?

1165
01:18:07,503 --> 01:18:09,095
I mean, I'm not cruel.

1166
01:18:11,607 --> 01:18:15,745
Well, why didn't you "do that"
for Claire Kuchever?

1167
01:18:17,446 --> 01:18:22,907
Well, because I needed her
to look like a ferry victim,

1168
01:18:23,019 --> 01:18:24,199
- and a bullet would've given it away.
- I see.

1169
01:18:24,234 --> 01:18:25,380
- And a bullet would've given it away.
- I see.

1170
01:18:25,488 --> 01:18:28,821
I went to her house
on the pretense of buying her car.

1171
01:18:28,924 --> 01:18:32,155
I took her from behind, taped her mouth
and threw a hood over her head.

1172
01:18:32,261 --> 01:18:33,228
Then?

1173
01:18:33,329 --> 01:18:36,355
<i>I bound her wrists and her ankles
and I drove her back to my place.</i>

1174

1175
01:18:38,401 --> 01:18:39,959
<i>and then I soaked her

Jesus.

1177
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:42,294
And?

1178
01:18:42,538 --> 01:18:43,937
I think you know
what happened after that.

1179
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,940
No, I don't know. I want you to tell me.
You gotta talk.

1180
01:18:46,042 --> 01:18:48,067
I mean, you know, come on, hero.
What happened after that?

1181
01:18:48,177 --> 01:18:49,337
I'll tell you what happened after that.

1182
01:18:49,445 --> 01:18:52,881
You killed 543 people.
How do you feel about that?

1183
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:01,649
I think that you were a murderer
right from the beginning.

1184
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,721
Sometimes a little human collateral
is the cost of freedom.

1185
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:09,695
To me,
those people were war casualties,

1186

<i>but to you, they're just evidence.</i>

1190
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:21,366
I know where you're going.

1191
01:19:21,777 --> 01:19:25,440

for a long time. I know that.

1192
01:19:26,449 --> 01:19:28,940

1196
01:19:40,629 --> 01:19:43,291
I told you earlier I have a destiny,

1197
01:19:43,399 --> 01:19:44,730
a purpose.

1198
01:19:45,434 --> 01:19:48,528
Satan reasons like man,
but God thinks of eternity.

1199
01:19:49,105 --> 01:19:53,633
Well, I prostrate myself before a world
that's going to hell in a handbag,

1200
01:19:53,742 --> 01:19:56,836
'cause in all eternity,
I am here and I will be remembered.

1201
01:19:56,946 --> 01:19:58,538
That's destiny.

1202
01:19:59,248 --> 01:20:01,011
A bomb has a destiny,

1203
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:04,610
a predetermined fate
set by the hand of its creator.

1204
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:08,019
And anyone who tries to alter
that destiny will be destroyed.

1205
01:20:08,124 --> 01:20:11,491
Anyone who tries to stop it
from happening will cause it to happen.

1206
01:20:11,594 --> 01:20:13,494
And that's what you don't understand.

1207
01:20:13,596 --> 01:20:17,430
We're not here to coexist.
I'm here to win.

1208
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:20,633
So you'd better have
some divine intervention, buddy.

1209
01:20:21,437 --> 01:20:23,564
You're gonna need it.

1210
01:20:23,873 --> 01:20:27,400
You'd better have some K-Y.
You're gonna need it.

1211

- We're shutting you down.
- What?

1213
01:20:45,628 --> 01:20:46,617
Yeah, we got what we need.

1214
01:20:46,729 --> 01:20:49,197
The forensics, the suspect,
a confession. We're done.

1215
01:20:49,298 --> 01:20:52,790
Sir, perhaps we should continue
and watch the actual crime.

1216
01:20:52,902 --> 01:20:54,426
- The ferry bombing.
- Right. He's right.

1217
01:20:54,537 --> 01:20:56,664
I mean, we can't just
go on the confession alone.

1218
01:20:56,772 --> 01:20:59,002
We need an airtight case.
We need to collect more evidence.

1219
01:20:59,108 --> 01:21:01,372
Well, collecting evidence
would've been fine, Agent Carly.

1220
01:21:01,477 --> 01:21:04,037
- You took it a little further than that.
- Agent Carlin. Carlin.
