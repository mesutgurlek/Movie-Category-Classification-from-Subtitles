1
00:03:05,105 --> 00:03:09,268
Hey, okay ...
now...

2
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:12,871
let's go again.

3
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:19,205
Which one's this, number 9?
- Yeah, number 9.  Bright eyes.

4
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,155
Are you watching this?

5
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,021
This, this is unbelieveable.

6
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,496
Oh, my God.

7
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:35,240
Oh, my God.

8
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,841
How many moves was that?
- 20.

9
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:44,257
The perfect score is 15.
God, what, what are you giving her?

10
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,603
Hey, give me that video!

11
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,837
Chimp number 9, just one dose.

12
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:56,493
Couldn't I see you later?
- We're good to go.

13
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:58,874
I'm going to call you back. Yeah,
all right.  Thanks, Bye.

14
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,699
112, it works.

15
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:04,459
On just the one primate?
- One is all we need.

16
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:06,262
Full cognitive recovery.

17
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,180
We're ready.

18
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,856
Look, are you sure you're
not rushing this?

19
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:13,248
I've been working on this for
five and a half years.

20
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:16,661
The data is clear.
We're ready, Steven.

21
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:19,034
All I need is your approval
for human trials.

22
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,263
Oh, for this, you're going to need
the Board's approval.

23
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,788
There's a lot of money riding
on this, Will.

24
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:26,829
You only get one shot.
- One shot is all I need.

25
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:30,014
[sighs]

26
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:33,712
All right. I'll need to see
all the research.

27
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:34,771
You got it!

28
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,580
Oh, and Will ...
- Yeah?

29
00:04:36,813 --> 00:04:39,234
Keep your personal emotions
out of it.

30
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,832
These people invest in results,
not dreams.

31
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:43,363
Okay!

32
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:50,962
Meet chimp 9. Here she's tasking at
what is called the Lucas Tower.

33
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:54,131
The object of which is to move the tower
from peg to peg

34
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:57,811
without placing a larger block
on top of a smaller block.

35
00:04:57,946 --> 00:05:02,003
As expected, she was unable
to complete the puzzle at all.

36
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:08,155
Then, we gave her what we call,
ALZ-112, a gene therapy

37
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:13,100
that allows the brain to create its
own cells in order to repair itself.

38
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:16,114
In biology, this is
called neurogenesis.

39
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:18,070
Here, at GEN-SYS,

40
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,743
we call it a cure to Alzheimer's.

41
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:28,066
Donnie, you get her ready?
- She's got stage fright.

42
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,532
Is that what it is?

43
00:05:33,895 --> 00:05:35,895
Hey, ape.

44
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,589
She's gonna break my arm!

45
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,006
Bright Eyes!
Let go!

46
00:05:47,484 --> 00:05:49,017
Are you all right?

47
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:58,081
We're ready to move
on to the next phase.

48
00:05:58,187 --> 00:06:00,374
Human trials.

49
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,127
Here you go, Bright Eyes.
It's your favorite fizzy soda.

50
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:06,237
Come on, let's go, Donnie.

51
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:07,765
We should have her downstairs already.

52
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:10,662
Okay. Good girl!

53
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:14,020
Come on out, girl, that's right.

54
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,872
That's for you.

55
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:21,970
Around the neck!

56
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,234
Jesus!

57
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:28,667
Donnie, open the cage!
Open up! Open up!

58
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:32,471
Going to sedate her!

59
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:35,107
No, no!
- Get the door!

60
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:43,386
No, no! Hold it! Now!

61
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,633
Call help! Donnie, Donnie!

62
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:48,768
There have been absolutely no side
effects associated

63
00:06:48,818 --> 00:06:51,201
with 112, with one exception.

64
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,149
For some reason,

65
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:55,367
the chimps irises exhibit
flecks of green.

66
00:06:55,473 --> 00:06:58,202
Actually, we first noticed it in chimp 9,

67
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,376
hence her nickname, Bright Eyes.

68
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:02,120
You'll see when we bring her in.

69
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:08,436
Move!

70
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,234
In theory, this therapy
can be used

71
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:14,318
to treat a wide range
of brain disorders.

72
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,948
It's virtually limitless.

73
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:23,431
As are the potential profits.

74
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:25,311
which is why we are confident that

75
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:29,465
you will vote to approve human trials.

76
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:37,200
No, no, no!

77
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,920
Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Jacobs I am begging you,

78
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,844
I am begging you, not to do this.

79
00:08:00,954 --> 00:08:02,046
Look, it costs a small fortune to

80
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,358
run lab workups on all of those chimps

81
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:06,151
only to tell me what I already know,

82
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:08,197
that they are contaminated.

83
00:08:08,286 --> 00:08:09,395
There are lives at stake here.

84
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,540
These, these are animals
with personalities,

85
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,531
with attachments.

86
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:16,111
Attachments?
- Yeah.

87
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:19,214
I run a a business,
not a petting zoo.

88
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:22,720
Find the most cost effective way
to put those apes down.

89
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,573
I can't do that.

90
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:25,200
You're the chimp handler.

91
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,349
Handle it.

92
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:28,454
Steven!

93
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:30,192
Well, that was fun!

94
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:31,573
They've taken the 112.

95
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:33,163
Board has rejected your proposal.

96
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,958
They've chosen to advance other programs.

97
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,778
Well, there must be something
that you can do.

98
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:39,250
Yes. There is, I could fire you.

99
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:41,446
Believe me, we talked about it.

100
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,804
We have five years of conclusive data.

101
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,273
Parade all the data you want,

102
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:48,419
you will never convince anyone
to invest another dime.

103
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,880
This drug has the potential
to save lives!

104
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:53,937
Bankrupt this company, more like.

105
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:56,856
I swear, you know everything
about the human brain

106
00:08:56,985 --> 00:08:59,576
except the way it works.

107
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:05,569
Go back to the drawing board
on the 112.

108
00:09:05,662 --> 00:09:07,988
Start again in
molecular development.

109
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,357
Find a way to get there
before someone else does.

110
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:14,341
And, clean up this mess.

111
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,086
Franklin!

112
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:43,500
It's very small. She must have been

113
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,350
pregnant when we brought her in.

114
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,670
So that's why ...

115
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,203
She wasn't being aggressive.
She was just being protective.

116
00:09:51,306 --> 00:09:53,326
She thought we were going to
hurt her baby.

117
00:09:57,176 --> 00:09:58,022
I would take it myself,

118
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,121
but my brother-in-law works for security.
He'd rat me out in a seceond.

119
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:04,768
What, you want me to take it home?

120
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:06,615
I can't take care of a monkey.

121
00:10:06,726 --> 00:10:09,378
He's not a monkey! He's an ape.
- Franklin ...

122
00:10:09,498 --> 00:10:10,860
You know, it's just for a couple days until

123
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,175
I find a sanctuary.  That's all I need.

124
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:14,122
Franklin, no!

125
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:16,404
Look, this isn't my responsibility.

126
00:10:16,454 --> 00:10:18,378
This, this is company property.

127
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:22,414
Okay ...

128
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,183
I tell you what, Doc.

129
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:26,973
Jacobs made me put down the other 12.

130
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:28,710
I'm done.

131
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:32,674
Be my guest.

132
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,475
Hey!
- Oh, hi.

133
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:02,433
You look beat.
- Yeah. How's he doing?

134
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:05,167
Well, he has good days and bad days.

135
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,617
Today, not so good, although he

136
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,814
has been quoting Shakespeare.

137
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:13,073
Oh, you got a pet?

138
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:16,335
Uh, it's just a temporary house guest.

139
00:11:16,506 --> 00:11:18,255
Well, maybe that'll be good for him.

140
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,255
Good night!

141
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:26,919
[discordant piano playing]

142
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:34,460
Hi, Dad!

143
00:11:38,361 --> 00:11:39,754
Dad?

144
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:43,868
Will! I didn't hear
you come in.

145
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:46,940
Today's the day, right?

146
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,556
You thought I'd forget?

147
00:11:48,606 --> 00:11:50,748
You have a big test today, right?

148
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,745
Chemistry?

149
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:56,551
Hey, Dad ...

150
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,078
You want to see something?
- What?

151
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:11,304
What is that? Is he injured?

152
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:14,475
No, I think that's a birthmark.

153
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:23,599
"As for Caesar, kneel down,
kneel down and wonder!"

154
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:25,600
Yeah, don't get too attached.

155
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:29,388
He's a cute little guy, isn't he?

156
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,670
Where's my car keys?

157
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:22,339
My car keys, where'd you put 'em?

158
00:13:22,446 --> 00:13:27,177
Dad, ... you a, you don't drive anymore.

159
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,417
I know that.

160
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,692
Here ...

161
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,527
Why don't you feed him.
Can you do that?

162
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:40,993
Of course, I can..

163
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,023
Will! ... Look at this!

164
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,509
How old is he?
Like, a day old? Two days old?

165
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,622
Yeah ...

166
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,174
He's a smart one, isn't he?

167
00:14:04,224 --> 00:14:07,000
What are you going to name him?

168
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:10,455
I do not know ...

169
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:21,597
Three years later

170
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:24,443
Right away, Caesar displayed signs
of intelligence heightened intelligence,

171
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:27,986
so I kept him.   And, brought
my work home.

172
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:43,853
By 18 months,
Caesar was signing up to 24 words.

173
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:53,049
By age two,
Caesar completing puzzles and models

174
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:56,275
designed for children
eight years and up.

175
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,215
At age three,

176
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:05,585
Caesar continues to show cognative skills

177
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:09,049
that far exceed
that of his human counterpart.

178
00:15:09,106 --> 00:15:12,239
Home ... home.

179
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:17,096
He completed the Lucas Tower in
15 moves, a perfect score.

180
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:21,791
I maintain my hypothesis that:
A. The green in his eyes indicate

181
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:26,061
that the ALZ-112 was passed
genetically from mother to son

182
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:30,342
and, B. That in the absence of damaged
cells that need to be replacing

183
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:36,534
the drug in his system has radically
boosted healthy brain functioning.

184
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,599
And, ...

185
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:44,298
he plays chess pretty well.

186
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:48,135
[shouting]

187
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:51,383
Dad!

188
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:55,331
I'm sorry.
- I can't do this, anymore.

189
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:56,960
He belongs in a home.

190
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,243
This is no way for him to live.

191
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:07,618
No way to live?

192
00:16:09,105 --> 00:16:11,896
I broke my lamp ...

193
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,182
It'll make you better, Dad.

194
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:26,664
[Shhh...]

195
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:49,398
Dad!

196
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:51,816
Dad!

197
00:17:52,587 --> 00:17:54,587
[exuberant piano playing]

198
00:18:14,842 --> 00:18:17,350
Todd, come inside for breakfast.

199
00:18:36,243 --> 00:18:38,630
I'll need to keep track of
what I take from the lab,

200
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,537
although I don't see you needing
more than one treatment a month.

201
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,199
Something amazing has happened!

202
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:47,291
I'll need a blood test,
a scan and the dosage ...

203
00:18:47,411 --> 00:18:49,033
carefully monitored.

204
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,952
Now, if I can sneak ...

205
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:54,057
Will!  I'm not sick, anymore!

206
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:56,065
It was nothing, Dad.

207
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:59,505
Ceasar.  Where's Caesar?
I want to see him.

208
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:08,338
Caesar!

209
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,541
Caesar!

210
00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:17,221
He can't have gone far.

211
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:19,287
Caesar!

212
00:19:20,739 --> 00:19:22,079
Daddy!

213
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:23,612
Caesar!

214
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:25,715
Get out of here! Get out!

215
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:29,676
Get out!

216
00:19:31,992 --> 00:19:35,006
Hey, hey, hey ...
Enough! Enough!

217
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,673
It doesn't matter what you do.

218
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:38,908
If I catch that animal anywhere
near my house or my kids, again ...

219
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:40,341
He's not dangerous.

220
00:19:40,391 --> 00:19:42,074
It won't happen again.

221
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,663
Damn right, it won't!

222
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:47,720
Come on, Dad.
- He, he just wanted to play.

223
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,854
Stay in the house!
Daddy's got you.

224
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,571
I told you not to go out without us.

225
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,032
It's okay ...

226
00:20:00,342 --> 00:20:01,745
How bad is it?

227
00:20:02,516 --> 00:20:03,929
I do not know.

228
00:20:23,866 --> 00:20:25,748
He likes you.
- Uh, huh.

229
00:20:26,899 --> 00:20:28,701
Don't worry. It'll be over soon.

230
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:30,325
Then, we can go get a treat.

231
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:33,022
I'm thinking, ice cream.

232
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:39,610
Good idea!

233
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:43,839
You taught him to sign?

234
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:46,098
Just, handful of things, basic stuff.

235
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,061
What's he saying?

236
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:50,893
Nothing.

237
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:55,157
So, when do you think we should come back?

238
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:55,678
Well, you won't need to come back.

239
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:59,164
because, um,
the stiches are dissolveable.

240
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:01,542
I would just say, watch for
signs of infection.

241
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:03,608
Fever ... redness ...

242
00:21:05,991 --> 00:21:08,555
Okay, what's he saying, now?

243
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:09,896
Um,

244
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:11,339
well, ...

245
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:15,396
he thinks that you and I should
have dinner together.

246
00:21:19,896 --> 00:21:20,896
(chuckling) I ... know ...

247
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:27,224
Caesar! Come on!

248
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:29,529
Good to see you, again, Caroline.

249
00:21:29,937 --> 00:21:31,667
You coming, Caesar?

250
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:33,477
So, what's your secret?

251
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:37,222
Oh, I can't take any credit.
It's in his genes.

252
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:39,215
I think you're being very modest.

253
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:40,205
He's pretty amazing.

254
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:46,144
I think you've built a pretty good
home for Caesar, here.

255
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:50,337
You know he won't stay this way for long.

256
00:21:51,082 --> 00:21:52,935
He's going to soon grow into

257
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:54,703
a large, powerful, animal.

258
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:56,327
Come here!

259
00:21:57,531 --> 00:21:59,461
How's he been doing?

260
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:00,855
Okay, I think.

261
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,890
I love chimpanzees.

262
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,536
I'm also afraid of them.

263
00:22:07,364 --> 00:22:10,004
And, it's appropriate to
be afraid of them.

264
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:11,963
Caesar will never hurt anyone.

265
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,726
He's happy here.

266
00:22:16,907 --> 00:22:18,582
Yeah, I see that.

267
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,862
We can at least give him some open space?

268
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:25,130
- Yeah. That would prpbably be a good idea.

269
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:31,608
I know a place right across the bridge,

270
00:22:31,658 --> 00:22:33,772
the Redwoods.  It's a paradise.

271
00:22:48,593 --> 00:22:50,803
Come on!

272
00:22:51,915 --> 00:22:53,159
Come here.

273
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,408
Doesn't need a leash!
He'll be fine. Come on!

274
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,701
Just to be safe.
- Come on, Caesar!

275
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:05,097
It's the redwoods.

276
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:15,146
Caesar!

277
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:16,176
All right.

278
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:21,381
If I take this off you can
not leave my sight.

279
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:23,549
I'll never find you again.

280
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,480
Okay.

281
00:23:26,777 --> 00:23:29,491
What's this?
- What's he doing?

282
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:32,364
I don't believe that!
- What?

283
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:34,718
He's asking your permission.

284
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:37,024
It's a supplicating gesture.

285
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:39,553
It's okay.

286
00:23:41,098 --> 00:23:43,591
Come on, Caesar!
Off you go!

287
00:23:54,653 --> 00:23:56,388
Look at him go!

288

There you are ...

293

Caesar!

294
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:24,012
Come on, Caesar, climb!

295
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:29,872
Go higher!

296
00:24:33,368 --> 00:24:34,847
Climb!

297
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:42,286
Be careful!

298
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:46,565

What's going on, buddy?

302
00:25:43,616 --> 00:25:45,473
Give some love.

303
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:47,888
Come on, honey.

304
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:50,733
Is that a chimpanzee?

Come on!

312
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:15,097
It's all right. Come on.

313

Come on!

314
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,053
Let's go.

315
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:30,688
Are you getting in?

316
00:26:30,738 --> 00:26:32,393
Caesar ...

317
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,279
You okay, pal?

318
00:26:55,687 --> 00:26:57,539
Are you pet? ... No.

319
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,850
You're not a pet.

320
00:27:07,176 --> 00:27:09,122
I am your father.

321
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,194
What is Caesar?

322
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:20,654
Okay ...

323
00:27:27,956 --> 00:27:30,930
Caesar, this is where I work.

324
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,748
This is were you were born.

325
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:37,756
Your mother was here
with other chimpanzees.

326
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:44,343
But she's not here, anymore ...

327
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:45,120
so ...

328
00:27:46,566 --> 00:27:49,936
... that's why I took home
to live with me.

329
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:58,299
Yeah.

330
00:27:59,702 --> 00:28:02,104
Your mother's dead.

331
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,690
The thing is, she was given medicine,

332
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:11,140
like the medicine I give to Charles.

333
00:28:11,527 --> 00:28:13,868
She passed it on to you.

334
00:28:13,918 --> 00:28:16,555
That's why you're so smart.

335
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:21,407
Let's take him home.

336
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:40,444
Come on, explain it to me.

337
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:41,171
All right.

338
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,164
I snuck him out of the lab
to save his life.

339
00:28:45,304 --> 00:28:49,155
I had no idea that the effects had
been transfered vertically from his mother.

340
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,132
But, since then, he's been displaying
incredible signs intelligence.

341
00:28:53,242 --> 00:28:57,694
I designed the 112 to repair,
but Caesar's gone way beyond that.

342
00:28:57,844 --> 00:29:00,654
Here's his IQ from last year.

343
00:29:00,761 --> 00:29:03,468
Since then, it's doubled.

344
00:29:05,164 --> 00:29:06,708
This is all wrong.

345
00:29:06,802 --> 00:29:09,898
My father was on gone
this drug brought him back.

346
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,854
You never saw how bad he was.

347
00:29:11,904 --> 00:29:13,306
He has his life again.

348
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,569
And, what about Caesar?
- What about him?

349
00:29:15,677 --> 00:29:18,357
How does he fit in?

350
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:21,799
With me, ... with us ...

351
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:23,106
Listen, ...

352
00:29:23,156 --> 00:29:25,706
I know it has been hard for you,

353
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,220
but you are trying to control things
that were never meant to be controlled.

354
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,524
The 112 works.

355
00:29:30,574 --> 00:29:33,074
Do you realize how you sound?

356
00:29:33,183 --> 00:29:35,409
All I'm saying is
this is a good thing.

357
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:37,746
Caesar's proof of that.

358
00:29:37,796 --> 00:29:39,186
So's my father.

359
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,101
Caesar, eat your food.

360
00:30:11,183 --> 00:30:14,730
Dad, are you okay?

361
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,549
Yeah, I'm fine.

362
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:25,798
Antibodies.

363
00:30:26,028 --> 00:30:29,180
His system has found a way
to fight the 112 virus

364
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,721
so that it can't deliver
its therapy.

365
00:30:32,276 --> 00:30:35,949
My father's disease is going
to return with a vengence.

366
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:26,432
Stop!

367
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,314
Stop, right now!

368
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,390
Hey! Get out there!
Get out of that car!

369
00:31:36,947 --> 00:31:40,354
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of my car!

370
00:31:40,404 --> 00:31:42,585
I said, get out of my car!

371
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:45,382
I'm a pilot! I've got to get
to the airport!

372
00:31:45,432 --> 00:31:47,609
How am I gonna get there now, huh?

373
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,097
Answer the God-damn question!
What were you doing?

374
00:31:50,217 --> 00:31:52,329
I have a car just exactly ...

375
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:54,885
I'm done ...
the police can handle it.

376
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:58,674
Stay right there!
You aren't going nowhere, mister!

377
00:31:58,778 --> 00:32:00,637
You will pay!

378
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:03,608
This is your problem,
you make it happen!

379
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:09,762
... not through with you!
Stay right there!

380
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:55,844
Caesar, stop!

381
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:57,932
Daddy!

382
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,041
Caesar!

383
00:33:19,024 --> 00:33:21,273
It's okay.

384
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:23,884
It's okay.

385
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:25,801
He didn't mean it.

386
00:33:26,453 --> 00:33:28,316
It's okay ...

387
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:54,431
Hey, hey, take that thing off of him!

388
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,440
Take that thing off of him!

389
00:33:57,491 --> 00:33:59,770
Look, I'll take him in, okay?

390
00:33:59,878 --> 00:34:01,782
No, he's under court orders.
We can't do that.

391
00:34:01,903 --> 00:34:03,308
It's fine! Let him.

392
00:34:03,358 --> 00:34:05,666
Bring him in when you're ready.

393
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:07,322
Take it off.

394
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,876
Thank you!

395
00:34:09,442 --> 00:34:12,346
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar,
... Caesar, Caesar.

396
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,974
Not right now.
It's going to be okay.

397
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:18,463
Let's just see what it's like
inside, okay.

398
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,469
Come on, Caesar.

399
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,246
Let's go.

400
00:34:26,053 --> 00:34:29,265
Come on, ... trust me.

401
00:34:44,152 --> 00:34:45,792
It's okay.

402
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,952
Go.

403
00:34:57,457 --> 00:35:00,776
He hasn't spent any time with other chimps.

404
00:35:00,826 --> 00:35:02,590
Oh, we're used to that.

405
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,665
He'll be a little skittish at first,
but we'll integrate him.

406
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:12,382
You'd be surprised
how quick they adapt.

407
00:35:12,598 --> 00:35:15,285
We provide a stimulating environment.

408
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:17,215
He's going to thrive here.

409
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,675
Come, let's do some paperwork.

410
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:22,552
Make sure you lock that door
when you come in.

411
00:35:46,566 --> 00:35:48,172
Caesar!

412
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,882
You'll be okay!

413
00:35:51,895 --> 00:35:55,019
Everything's going to be okay!

414
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,724
Don't be scared.

415
00:35:56,845 --> 00:35:59,027
You're going to stay here, now.

416
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:06,133
No ... Not going home right now.

417
00:36:06,184 --> 00:36:07,248
It's OK.

418
00:36:08,028 --> 00:36:11,570
The longer you drag out the good-byes,

419
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,191
the harder it is.

420
00:36:13,582 --> 00:36:15,909
Can I sign that later?

421
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:20,555
You'll probably miss him more than
he'll miss you.

422
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,811
You'd best give him a couple of weeks
to get used too the place.

423
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:25,174
Will, we have to go.

424
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,887
We have to go home.

425
00:36:27,024 --> 00:36:30,301
Coming back soon, okay?

426
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:37,966
Just call ahead, before you do.

427
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:43,786
Hey, over here!

428
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:47,523
Hey, I can get you out!

429
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:54,143
Come on!  Over here!

430
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:09,606
Hey, down here.

431
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:24,023
Stupid monkey ...

432
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:51,421
So you? Come on, make it!

433
00:37:58,888 --> 00:38:01,305
Court order hasn't been filed,
so it's not in the system.

434
00:38:01,398 --> 00:38:02,334
Once it comes through,

435
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:04,768
it will take about 90 days before
you receive an appeal date.

436
00:38:04,881 --> 00:38:06,421
90 days?
- Yes, sir, 90 days.

437
00:38:06,545 --> 00:38:08,187
You'll be notified by mail.

438
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:10,956
Here's what's going to happen.

439
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:12,982
You're going to go back to your computer,
you know, shift things around

440
00:38:14,062 --> 00:38:16,745
and you're going to get me a date for
my appeal, this week, you got it?

441
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:18,747
I can't help you.

442
00:38:18,898 --> 00:38:20,445
All right, then we have a problem.

443
00:38:20,496 --> 00:38:22,182
Because, I'm not moving until you do.

444
00:38:22,521 --> 00:38:26,389
90 days, sir. Be thankful
you're talking about court dates.

445
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:29,057
You're lucky they
didn't put that animal down.

446
00:38:31,658 --> 00:38:34,325
I promised to get him back
soon, Dad.

447
00:38:36,825 --> 00:38:38,967
Dad?

448
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:48,151
My father's immune system
continues to reject the 112 virus,

449
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:51,125
rendering the gene therapy obsolete.

450
00:38:51,234 --> 00:38:56,605
his health is deteriorating,
and the disease is progressing rapidly.

451
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,846
I need a more aggressive virus strain,

452
00:38:59,942 --> 00:39:02,413
a faster delivery method,

453
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,026
because at this rate ...

454
00:39:13,482 --> 00:39:15,482
I can't lose them both.

455
00:39:19,787 --> 00:39:21,968
I won't lose them both.

456
00:39:25,023 --> 00:39:26,505
Hi .... Can we talk?

457
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:29,093
Make it fast.  I've got a meeting.

458
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:32,604
The ten years you have been
running GEN-SYS,

459
00:39:32,744 --> 00:39:36,781
how many drugs have come down the pipeline
that could save millions of lives?

460
00:39:36,895 --> 00:39:39,060
That could change everything?

461
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:40,675
What are you talking about?

462
00:39:41,825 --> 00:39:42,677
The ALZ-112.

463
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:46,672
What happened to you, Will?

464
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:50,453
You used to be the star of this lab.
Now, you hardly ever show

465
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:52,549
and when you do, you waste your time
and that of your team's

466
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,492
fixating on a drug

467
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,578
that, after what happened,
is never ever going to get approved.

468
00:39:57,702 --> 00:39:59,588
The 112 is dangerous, Will,

469
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:01,029
and it doesn't work.

470
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,493
I treated my father with it.

471
00:40:03,543 --> 00:40:04,618
It does work.

472
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:07,976
You did, what?

473
00:40:08,026 --> 00:40:09,299
You did, what!?

474
00:40:09,425 --> 00:40:11,604
Beat the disease, like we predicted.

475
00:40:11,732 --> 00:40:12,265
Brilliant.

476
00:40:12,315 --> 00:40:13,854
There's been a complication.

477
00:40:13,982 --> 00:40:15,447
Well, does it work or doesn't it?

478
00:40:15,484 --> 00:40:18,037
My father's disease eventually
outran the cure.

479
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,583
Oh, for goodness sake.

480
00:40:19,677 --> 00:40:22,957
The immune system produced antibodies
to beat the viral component,

481
00:40:23,095 --> 00:40:24,516
but it will work.

482
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,855
I've have already developed a virus strain

483
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:28,870
that I think will be more aggressive.

484
00:40:28,978 --> 00:40:30,145
You think?

485
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:32,673
Just, let me test it.

486
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:35,489
You're wasting my time.

487
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:36,837
There's more!

488
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:41,204
The applications go beyond the disease.

489
00:40:41,301 --> 00:40:45,339
There are indications that show the
therapy can improve cognitive functioning,

490
00:40:45,471 --> 00:40:46,729
memory quality ...

491
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:49,102
What, what are you saying?

492
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,768
My father didn't just recover.

493
00:40:51,923 --> 00:40:52,968
He improved.

494
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,937
You mean, increased intelligence?

495
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:57,382
It's not conclusive, but yes.

496
00:41:00,118 --> 00:41:04,818
I want you, to start testing the
revised 112 on chimps, A-S-A-P.

497
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,370
Okay.

498
00:41:06,462 --> 00:41:08,462
I'll give you whatever you need,
but get started.

499
00:41:13,488 --> 00:41:14,842
Dinner time!

500
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:28,730
Great Ape, primate!

501
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,747
Go on, don't you know food
when you see it?

502
00:41:46,574 --> 00:41:48,277
You think that's funny, huh?

503
00:41:50,238 --> 00:41:51,960
I show you something funny!

504
00:42:05,544 --> 00:42:07,897
You'll learn who's boss, soon enough.

505
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:11,187
What about his clothes?

506
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,093
What about 'em?

507
00:42:12,223 --> 00:42:16,805
I don't know ... May cause problems
with the other apes.

508
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,236
Good!

509
00:43:23,008 --> 00:43:24,353
I counted ten apes, correct?

510
00:43:24,403 --> 00:43:25,074
Yep.

511
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:28,334
Good.  All the way to the back.

512
00:43:30,528 --> 00:43:33,804
You guys are moving really quick on this.
What's the big rush?

513
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:36,248
First day back,
you're still complaining.

514
00:43:51,835 --> 00:43:54,998
Koba. Hi, I'm Will.

515
00:44:04,321 --> 00:44:06,580
This one.

516
00:44:06,482 --> 00:44:07,886
He's very calm.

517
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:08,387
Yeah.

518
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:12,084
He's been through a whole lot of labs.
He knows the drill.

519
00:44:14,097 --> 00:44:17,354
Could I join you,
what's our progress.

520
00:44:18,168 --> 00:44:19,862
Get him prepped.

521
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:26,689
Tighten your masks.

522
00:44:26,739 --> 00:44:28,333
Pass me the 113.

523
00:44:29,368 --> 00:44:32,686
Pulse-ox is good,
blood pressure is steady.

524
00:44:37,011 --> 00:44:39,146
Perisol delivery, in place.

525
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:46,605
Releasing the 113.

526
00:45:03,177 --> 00:45:05,001
We have a break!

527
00:45:05,095 --> 00:45:07,096
Franklin, get your mask on!

528
00:45:09,557 --> 00:45:10,953
Got it?

529
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:11,993
Yeah.

530
00:45:12,098 --> 00:45:14,070
You okay?

531
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,693
Yeah, okay.

532
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:23,846
Move it!  Let's go!

533
00:45:24,895 --> 00:45:27,512
Get up and do some exercises
you lazy baboons!

534
00:48:10,881 --> 00:48:13,124
Intelligence results are remarkable.

535
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:14,375
There are no adverse effects.

536
00:48:14,497 --> 00:48:16,543
Apes have amazingly strong
immune systems.

537
00:48:17,837 --> 00:48:19,772
All right, keep an eye on him.

538
00:48:19,822 --> 00:48:21,365
Okay. [Franklin sneezes]

539
00:48:21,427 --> 00:48:22,628
Sorry about that.

540
00:48:22,678 --> 00:48:25,610
These guys are more resiliant than I am.

541
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:30,457
Excuse me a second.

542
00:49:02,037 --> 00:49:05,390
Hurt bad?

543
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:10,375
Do you know sign language?

544
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:14,252
Circus monkey.

545
00:49:24,984 --> 00:49:26,294
He's good.

546
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:33,561
Careful. The Humans do not like
intelligent monkeys.

547
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:42,454
You're working late tonight.

548
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:44,637
GEN-SYS needs three more.

549
00:50:10,305 --> 00:50:12,031
Hey, Caesar!

550
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:17,024
Are you hurt?

551
00:50:18,157 --> 00:50:19,773
Show me.

552
00:50:22,797 --> 00:50:26,900
Caesar, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

553
00:50:26,995 --> 00:50:29,088
Sometimes, the new kid on the
block gets picked on.

554
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:32,502
Stay calm. What did they do?

555
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,081
That's bullshit!

556
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:38,028
What's the problem here?

557
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:42,037
I'm taking him out of here, right now.

558
00:50:42,087 --> 00:50:44,207
Not without a court order, you're not.

559
00:50:44,438 --> 00:50:46,528
He's not yours, anymore.

560
00:50:46,698 --> 00:50:48,793
I promise, if I find out he's been
mistreated in any way,

561
00:50:48,903 --> 00:50:51,848
I'll have this place shut down.

562
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:54,873
Go on ...

563
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:07,597
No.  No, we're not going home,
right now.

564
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:12,286
I'm going to get you out of here,
I promise.

565
00:51:14,703 --> 00:51:16,370
You have to trust me.

566
00:51:16,496 --> 00:51:18,957
Caesar, you have to trust me, okay?

567
00:51:19,007 --> 00:51:20,900
I think this visit's over.

568
00:51:21,174 --> 00:51:22,332
Trust me.

569
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:24,329
You'll be okay.

570
00:52:07,744 --> 00:52:09,773
Come on, move it!
Let's go!

571
00:52:57,879 --> 00:53:00,936
There are hundreds of them!
Looks like you're own private zoo!

572
00:53:01,051 --> 00:53:03,322
Rather like a prison
for hairy dudes.

573
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:05,053
They watch TV?

574
00:53:05,103 --> 00:53:07,534
We call it enrichment.

575
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:12,706
Aw, this one's so cute!

576
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,055
What's his name?

577
00:53:15,105 --> 00:53:17,819
Uh, name's Cornelia. It's a she.

578
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:18,529
[shreek]

579
00:53:19,648 --> 00:53:20,438
Oh, my God!

580
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,278
Don't get too close!

581
00:53:21,395 --> 00:53:23,310
This one scared me half to death.

582
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,216
That big guy is called, Maurice.

583
00:53:25,607 --> 00:53:27,433
It's no fun.

584
00:53:27,548 --> 00:53:30,349
Here, I'll show you something fun.

585
00:53:34,082 --> 00:53:35,608
Check this out!

586
00:53:39,058 --> 00:53:40,755
It's crazy!

587
00:53:40,912 --> 00:53:43,181
You shouldn't be in here.

588
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:44,766
Hey, you're next!

589
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,706
Come on, let's go.

590
00:53:52,756 --> 00:53:55,670
We spent too much time in here,
as it is.

591
00:53:57,805 --> 00:53:58,977
Come on!

592
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,724
Check out this guy.

593
00:54:00,774 --> 00:54:04,639
Hey, Alan, he's a pain in the ass.
He thinks he's special, or something

594
00:54:06,154 --> 00:54:07,886
Freaky!

595
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:10,572
Hey, come here.

596
00:54:11,066 --> 00:54:13,115
I think he's thinking or something.

597
00:54:14,427 --> 00:54:16,782
Oh, my God, he's got him by the throat!

598
00:54:16,832 --> 00:54:17,478
Let him go!

599
00:54:17,573 --> 00:54:19,008
Let go!

600
00:54:20,834 --> 00:54:22,598
Are you okay?

601
00:54:22,648 --> 00:54:23,173
Yes.

602
00:54:23,723 --> 00:54:25,903
I told you not
to get too close, man.

603
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:28,198
Come on, guys, let's get out of here.

604
00:59:17,691 --> 00:59:20,562
Some things aren't meant
be changed.

605
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,090
You need to accept that.

606
00:59:27,053 --> 00:59:28,228
Hey!

607
00:59:28,278 --> 00:59:29,453
Hey!

608
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:31,508
What's going on here?

609
00:59:31,618 --> 00:59:33,160
More 113 trials.
We're just prepping ...

610
00:59:33,274 --> 00:59:35,845
Oh, no, we have to analyze
Koba's blood work first!

611
00:59:35,953 --> 00:59:37,884
Franklin knows this.
Where is he?

612
00:59:37,935 --> 00:59:39,510
He's out sick for two days.

613
00:59:39,603 --> 00:59:42,084
Well, I didn't authorized this.

614
00:59:42,134 --> 00:59:43,052
No!

615
00:59:43,144 --> 00:59:44,601
I did.

616
00:59:44,705 --> 00:59:47,029
We agreed to test sparingly
on one subject.

617
00:59:47,144 --> 00:59:49,712
And, that one subject is stunning!

618
00:59:49,808 --> 00:59:52,496
It's a virus. We don't know the human
related effects.

619
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:54,280
The drug works, Will.

620
00:59:54,331 --> 00:59:55,581
Tell him, Linda.

621
00:59:55,749 --> 00:59:58,595
For starters, Koba scored
a perfect 15 on the Lucas Tower.

622
00:59:59,717 --> 01:00:01,717
Every test result verifies
its effectiveness.

623
01:00:01,929 --> 01:00:03,440
No more tests.
- What are you ...?

624
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,452
Not until we have a better understanding
of what we're dealing with.

625
01:00:05,563 --> 01:00:07,540
Look, I'll tell you exactly
what we do. Look ...

626
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:08,357
Give us a minute.

627
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:11,084
Excuse me!   Put the ape
back in the cage. Be gentle.

628
01:00:11,196 --> 01:00:14,271
Will, I'll tell you exactly what
we're dealing with, here.

629
01:00:14,423 --> 01:00:16,584
We're dealing with a drug
that is worth more

630
01:00:16,687 --> 01:00:19,745
than everything else
we are developing, combined.

631
01:00:19,915 --> 01:00:21,813
You make history,

632
01:00:21,863 --> 01:00:23,227
I make money.

633
01:00:23,336 --> 01:00:25,749
Isn't that our arrangement?
- No! There are risks.

634
01:00:25,844 --> 01:00:27,624
Don't you tell me about risks.

635
01:00:27,735 --> 01:00:30,791
You give your own father
an experimental drug.

636
01:00:30,959 --> 01:00:33,433
I could finish your career
with one phone call.

637
01:00:33,552 --> 01:00:35,934
I'll save you the trouble. I quit.

638
01:00:37,277 --> 01:00:40,167
We will proceed without you.

639
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,724
Look ... You do not know what you're doing.

640
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:45,662
These tests need to be contained.

641
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:48,014
You have no idea if the 113 is stable,

642
01:00:48,064 --> 01:00:50,607
what kind of damage it can
do to people ...

643
01:00:50,701 --> 01:00:55,669
Well, that is why we test it
on chimps, ... isn't it?

644
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:59,888
Dr. Rodman, it's, me, Franklin!
I need to talk to you!

645
01:00:59,987 --> 01:01:02,014
Can you come to the door?

646
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,456
Doc!
[coughing]

647
01:01:16,787 --> 01:01:18,985
Who the hell are you?
[Franklin sneezes on neighbor]

648
01:01:22,197 --> 01:01:23,837
Get out of here!

649
01:01:23,945 --> 01:01:26,147
I'm sorry, ... I'm sorry.

650
01:01:41,826 --> 01:01:44,904
You wouldn't be trying to entrap me,
would you?

651
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:51,251
Well, ... I can't say that I approve.

652
01:01:51,301 --> 01:01:53,975
They're not people, you know.

653
01:01:54,084 --> 01:01:55,909
You gonna to let him go or not?

654
01:02:09,127 --> 01:02:12,167
Caesar, ... hey, come on.

655
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,300
Come on, we're go home.

Yeah, well, if I've didn't
take the cookies,
