(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

2
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,556
Would you like
something sweet?

3
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:31,581
Oh.

4
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,743
What do we got here, fellas,
an antique show?

5
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,545
All right, boys, fan out!

6
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,912
What a wrinkle fest this is.

7
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,150
Hey, beat it, you broads!
Come on!

8
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,621
All right, sit down
and shut up!

9
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,461
We're the Red Eyes.
So, everybody, freeze!

10
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,998
Get their valuables, boys.
I want watches,
wallets, jewelry.

11
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:15,526
Get me some silver chains.
I want wigs. I want toupees.

12
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,964
Keep an eye out
for me, will ya?

13
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:25,211
No, not mine! Leave me alone!
I'm a veteran!

14
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:28,204
No! Not that!

15
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,344
I love crashing parties!

16
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,855
Hey, cake!

17
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,285
RAJA: Pardon me, Fatty.

18
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:46,356
But if you're going
to eat cake, you ought
to use a fork.

19
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:49,959
You might just as well
shovel it in.

20
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,176
People who don't close
their mouths when they chew

21
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,509
make me furious.

22
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,280
One for you. Drat.

23
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,083
And for you!

24
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,863
Come on, come on.

25
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,794
Want a little whipped cream,
Mr. Cherry Top?

26
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,030
Get him, get him.

27
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,609
Is that all you got, huh?
Is that all you...

28
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,549
Throw it!

29
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,916
Not today,
my vermilion-eyed varlet.

30
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,355
Oh, blast.

31
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,915
Out of the way!

32
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,203
Yes, this one should stick.

33
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:06,035
Oh, my! That's way
too tight, man!

34
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,078
(EXCLAIMING)

35
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,289
It's Captain Amazing!

36
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,768
It's Amazing! I'm out of here!

37
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:55,320
C.A., you were,
if I may say, amazing.

38
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,629
Yeah?
Yeah.

39
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,530
Let's go meet the press.

40
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,096
He is good.

41
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,402
He is rather ripping,
isn't he?

42
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,929
The spinning and the hurting
and the kicking.

43
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,836
I guarantee you he hogs
the credit on this one.

44
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,043
Well, I think we have to

45
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,536
at least concede him
the assist here, Roy.

46
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,982
No, no. You see?
That's exactly what's
holding us back.

47
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,985
Don't put him on the pedestal,
put us on the pedestal.

48
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,579
Here he comes.

49
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,958
Bravo and huzzah, Captain.
Splendid work, as usual.

50
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,727
No autographs till
we finish with the press.

51
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,463
We're not...
Allow me to introduce myself.

52
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,465
Blue Raja,
master of silverware,

53
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,401
forks a specialty,
at your service.

54
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,869
My colleague, the Shoveler.

55
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,270
Big fan of your work.

56
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,907
And standing rather painfully
aside is our cohort,
Mr. Furious.

57
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,042
How's it hanging?

58
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:44,169
So you guys...

59
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,071
They're superheroes.

60
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,083
We fight crime.
Call it what you will.
Quite right.

61
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,553
That's great. Just, you know,

62
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,788
keep up the good work.

63
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,722
You as well, sir. You as well.

64
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,864
Did you see... Did you...

65
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,459
Did you hear that?
"Keep up the good work."

66
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:08,667
The good work.

67
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,802
He's making fun of us.

68
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,538
No, Roy.
He saluted us.
That was real.

69
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,573
I thought he was sincere.
What's up, fellas?

70
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,508
Hello.
Nice to see you.

71
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,012
I saw the action
out there tonight.

72
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:23,313
What you guys need is
a little bit of firepower.

73
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,650
Well...

74
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,380
I'm a weapons designer.

75
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,121
I've got what you need.

76
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,590
All right.
We'll come back.

77
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,294
We'll visit all of
you people later.
Thank you, sir.

78
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,492
I don't live here.
I'm here for the ladies.

79
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,559
Here, take my card.

80
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,397
My name's Heller.
Say it with me.

81
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,274
Heller.
Heller.

82
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,800
All right. Thank you.

83
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,746
Goodnight.

84
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,514
I don't know why you encourage
those people.

85
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,449
Those people look up to us.

86
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,112
Oh, that's true.

87
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,420
You know the drill.

88
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,480
Please sign my hat,
Captain Amazing.

89
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,952
Herman, give me a flash.

90
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,761
Hey, how are you tonight?

91
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,730
Captain, how did you know
where to find the Red Eyes?

92
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,566
Becky, it's what I do.

93
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,568
Thanks to you,
the city's almost crime-free.

94
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,868
So what do you do
with your free time?

95
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,140
I wish that I had
some free time.

96
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,810
People are saying that you're
so "amazing" you're gonna put
yourself out of a job.

97
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,211
Have any comments on that?

98
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,681
That's one problem
I look forward to.

99
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:32,379
And is it true that you lost
your Pepsi endorsement?

100
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,051
I hadn't heard that.

101
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,457
Thanks so much
for your questions.
Thank all of you so much.

102
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:42,292
You sure, you have
no comments regarding
your Pepsi situation?

103
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,771
Look who we got.

104
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:55,332
You again. Wannabes.

105
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,177
This city already
has a superhero.

106
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:01,013
Perhaps you've heard of him.
Captain Amazing.

107
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,243
Thank you.

108
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,851
Do yourself a favor, Maguire.

109
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,886
Don't flip my switch tonight.

110
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:12,382
And what exactly
would that do?

111
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,095
Don't turn around, Roy.
Don't do it.
Don't turn around.

112
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,497
It's nothing. Keep walking, Roy.
Keep walking.

113
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,466
It's not worth it.

114
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:27,606
I think you know
exactly what that would do,
checkerhead.

115
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,606
What?

116
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,476
Don't mess with
the volcano, my man.

117
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:42,511
'Cause I will go Pompeii
on your butt.

118

POLICEMAN: Oh, my golly.
Good grief.

120
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:51,529
You keep dreaming, wannabe.

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,163
Let's go.
Dream on, moron.

122
00:08:57,504 --> 00:09:00,633
I will keep dreaming.
I will keep dreaming,
my friend.

123
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,533
And when I wake up,
you better hope,

124
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,678
you better hope you're asleep.

125
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,048
Don't reengage him.
He's a silly...

126
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,215
Sweet dreams!

127
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,316
He's immature.

128

Lilac.

129
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,023
C.A., I'm doing my best.

130
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:22,894
Your best?
Quick question:
Is this your best?

131
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,930
I realize you're upset.

132
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,598
Victor, I'm positioned.

133
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:31,136
Do you understand
what that means?
On a very personal level here,

134
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,906
to know that the companies
that make these fine products

135
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,899
want me to be
their spokesperson?
Their voice?

136
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,079
I think right now we should
focus on the positive.

137
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,775
Tonight was good.

138
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,681
Yeah? You think so?

139
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:48,477
'Cause I was worried it was,
I don't know, pathetic!

140
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,389
"Amazing triumphs
at a nursing home!"

141
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,051
That's great copy, Vic.

142
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,250
I'm a publicist,
not a magician.

143
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,562
You want big news,
you have to have big fights.

144
00:09:56,563 --> 00:10:00,522
A superhero needs
a supervillain and, thanks
to you, we've got none left.

145
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:04,203
Then get the Death Man.

146
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,364
Death Man is dead.

147
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,239
Okay. Father Doom.

148
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,571
Life without parole.

149
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,944
Apocalypta's doing 50 years.
Armagezzmo's in exile.

150
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,745
Baron Von Chaos got the chair.

151
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:14,847
Really?

152
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,249
Casanova Frankenstein
is locked up in a nuthouse.

153
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,048
Casanova Frankenstein.

154
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,987
Now, there was a supervillain.

155
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,924
You know, he just...

156
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,660
He's got those eyes, you know?

157
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,024
I can't do it, but...

158
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,164
And that voice...
Such pure evil.

159
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,967
The battles we used to have.
Extraordinary.

160
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,299
"Used to."

161
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,765
That's the problem,

(MEN SHOUTING)

163
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,041
CHAIRMAN: Let the record show

164
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,410
that this parole hearing
has officially begun.

165

(GAVEL BANGING)

166
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:40,058
We now commence
the 17th parole hearing
of Casanova Frankenstein.

167
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,699
Dr. Leek, you may begin.

168
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,162
Thank you.

169
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,108
Gentlemen of the board,
the man who sits before you,

170
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:54,774
the once infamous evil genius,
is entirely cured.

171
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,215
What?

172
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,282
I give you my word

173
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:01,550
that he's of no more danger
to the city than I am.

174
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,355
This is outrageous.

175
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,721
Yes.

176
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,222
CHAIRMAN: Mr. Casanova
Frankenstein,

177
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:11,052
do you have anything to say
on your own behalf?

178
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:15,659
Blessed disciples
of Hippocrates,

179
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,571
my heart is split in two.

180
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,306
It brims

181
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,871
with such sorrow
for my abominable crimes.

182
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,812
And yet,

183
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,086
it swells with love

184
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,115
for you,

185
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,992
for this sanctuary,

186
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,860
this place of healing.

187
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,696
Within my soul,
I feel the choir singing

188
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,133
Beethoven's immortal
Ode to Joy

189
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,197
where all men

190
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,410
become brothers.

191
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,401
(DOOR OPENING)

192
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,147
Am I too late to cast my vote?

193
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:09,120
Not at all, Lance.
I was just about to
remind the board

194
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,725
that Casanova once
had our city in
a stranglehold of terror.

195
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:18,323
Parole is not an option
for this man, this monster.

196
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,932
We cannot risk
the danger of releasing him.

197
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,535
I could not agree
with you more.

198
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:24,526
Excellent.

199
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:30,409
However, I did just
have dinner with
an old friend recently.

200
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,378
Maybe you've heard of him?
Captain Amazing.

201
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,579
Captain Amazing?

202
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,210
He asked if I would read this.

203
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,088
"Dear members of the board,

204
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:45,557

00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,754
"without absolute justice,

206
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:53,896
"but society is also
built upon compassion.

208

00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,715
"a second chance."

With Captain Amazing's
recommendation and protection,

213
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:21,252
I suppose we could consider.

214
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,419
I pronounce you

215
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,762
cured.

216
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,937

(EXCLAIMING)

219
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,033
Hi, everybody.

220
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,703
You know, tooth decay
and gingivitis can be a crime.

221
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,139
That's why I use
Mighty Whity toothpaste.

222
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:11,102
Because I want my teeth
to look amazing.

223
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,813
I'm gonna bring this up again.

224
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:17,048
It's 150 bucks apiece.
We each chip in.

225
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,484
My cousin knows this guy who
knows a publicist.

226
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,355
What are we gonna publicize?
The fact that we get
our butts kicked a lot.

227
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,291
Maybe if you didn't smack me
in the face with the shovel
every time we went out...

228
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,360
All right now.
...we'd have some more
wins to brag about.

229
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:31,229
I'm sorry, I just have
a tendency to lose
my concentration

230
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,398
when I've got a salad fork
stuck in my rear end.

231
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,568
I get it. Your shovel
in his face is my fault.

232
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,871
You threw a spoon
at the guy, Jeff.

233
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,072
What was up with that?

234
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,207
I'm embarrassed about that.

235
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,308
I thought it was a fork.

236
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,409
You're the master of cutlery.

237
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,746
You can't throw a knife
sometimes when someone's
trying to kill me?

238
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,614
You can't use
a rake sometimes?

239
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,715
No, I'm the Shoveler.

240
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,084
I'm the Blue Raja.
I'm not Stab Man.

241
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,121
I'm not Knifey Boy.
I'm the Blue Raja.

242
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,189
That's another thing.

243
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,290
What?

244
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,659
You could get a little bit
of blue in the uniform
somewhere.

245
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,296
You've got green.
There's a little
flowery thing.

246
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,165
It doesn't make
a lot of sense.

247
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,965
Just step out of
our literal minds
for a moment.

248
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,771
Hey, look what I'm doing.
Look at that.

249
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,073
I'm putting 150 right
on the table.
Who's in with me?

250
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,209
I don't have 150, do I?

251
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,845
If I did, I wouldn't have
plundered my mother's
silverware.

252
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,046
It's a waste of money.

253
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,846
You know who doesn't think
it's a waste of money?

254
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,350
Little Mr. Captain Amazing.

255
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:26,451
Well, Captain...

256
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,221
If we had a billionaire
like Lance Hunt
as our benefactor,

257
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,189
yeah, we could spend 150.

258
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,058
Lance Hunt is Captain Amazing.

259
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:35,892
Don't start that again.

260
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:40,599
Lance Hunt wears glasses.
Captain Amazing doesn't
wear glasses.

261
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,601
He takes them off
when he transforms.

262
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:46,004
That doesn't make any sense.
He wouldn't be able to see.

263
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,076
Hi, thanks for waiting.

264
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,909
Hey, thanks for dropping by.

265
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,013
Do you know what you want?

266
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,015
Allow me to begin, my dear.

267
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,384
The Blue Raja is quite partial
to the salad ni9oise.

268
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,987
My dressing of choice
is ranch lite,

269
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:05,048
and I'd appreciate it
if you'd hold the Bacon Bits.

270
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,860
Seeing as it's your
first night and all,
I suppose I'll "fork-give" you

271
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,996
if you "fork-get."

Who's next?

274
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,301
Can I get a meatball sandwich
on white with mayo?

275
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:19,371
I'll have a steak, please.
Very rare. That means pink,
not bloody.

276
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,006
And could I get some ice?

277
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:24,109
I had a little mishap
defending justice
at the nursing home.

278
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,909
I thought I heard on TV
that was Captain Amazing.

279
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,810
(LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY)

280
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,883
Let's all be good little
automaton droids and believe
everything we hear on TV.

281
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:39,119
I'll just go place
your order now.

282
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,396
A trifle strident with
that bit of crumpet,
weren't we, Furious?

283
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,127
I am a ticking
time bomb of fury.

284
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,669
All I'm saying is,
when we split the check
three ways,

285
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,338
the steak-eater picks
the pocket of the salad man.

286
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,973
Just give me the money, Jeff.

287
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,241
Yes, fine.

288
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,710
Every time we split it
three ways.

289
00:17:58,711 --> 00:17:59,701
It's flipping robbery.

290
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,381
Well, you should order more.

RAJA: Hello?

294
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:10,989
SHOVELER: It's Tony C.

295
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,517
And Tony P,
leader of the Disco Boys.

296
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,297
But why, pray tell,
would he be back in town?

297
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,377
Maybe it's time to do
a little following
to find out.

298
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:34,176
SHOVELER: No,
it's already 10:30.

299

I'm gonna get killed
by my wife as it is.

300
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:40,146
Yes, and I've had quite enough
excitement for one night,
thank you.

301
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,522
My mistake. I thought I was
hanging out with
serious superheroes:

302
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,157
The Shoveler
and the Blue Raja.

303
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:50,261
But, apparently,
I'm hanging out with
Lazy Boy and...

Good night, Roy.

Yes, toodle-oo.

Yeah, Lazy Boy
and the Recliner!

Guys, are you coming?
Are you...

310
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,549
Okay, fine. I guess tonight

the lone wolf

00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,584
Well, it's my vest too.
I bought it for him.

320
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:22,213
The only thing I need...

321
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,655
Okay.

322
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,249
How long you gonna
do this, Eddie?

323
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,159
It's been 12 years.

324
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,150
I know.

325
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,797
You got a family
to look after, Eddie.

326
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,491
The kids are worried sick
about you.

327
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:39,796
But still you go out,
night after night, running
around the city for what?

328
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:44,032
Lucille, God gave me a gift.

329
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,779
I shovel well.
I shovel very well.

330
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,984
Oh, baby, you shovel better
than any man I've known

331
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,720
but that does not make you
a superhero.

332

Oh, no.

334
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,126
You're a good husband

335
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,459
and a good father,

336
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,960
but that's all, nothing more.

337
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,435
You're right.

338
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,102
I believe in you, Daddy.

encourage your father.

Well, if it isn't
our old friends, the Red Eyes.

Yeah?

345
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:49,974
Mom, how many times have I
asked you not to barge
in here?

346
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,976
What's burning?

Incense.

00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,680
I can't even count
how many rules you're breaking
right now.

349
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,783
One: Always knock.
Two: Don't sniff around
outside my door.

350
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,019
Three: Do not interrogate me.

Jeffrey.

352
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,179
What?

353
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,117
Are you into marijuana?

354
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,293
You're cheesing me off
so bad right now.

355
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:09,861
Just, please... Good night.

356
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:12,096
I'm sorry.
Jeffrey, please...

Goodnight.

358
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,223
Okay. Goodnight.

Just as I left it.

366
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:06,472
You've been locked up
for 20 years. A lot of things
have changed since then.

367
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:12,042
It must have been hard
for you, the way times
and styles have changed,

368
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,854
to hear the people saying
that disco is dead.

369
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:19,882
Disco is not dead!
Disco is life!

Yes, Tony, that is the passion
I remember.

00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,037
Stick with me, Tony,
and you will dance again

Have you met
my psychiatrist?

Come out, come out

00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:50,288
There we go.

00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,590
Looks like we got
a little terrace party.

I want you to spread
the word to all of my gangs.

Casanova Frankenstein is back

00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,360

00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,759
And now, if you will
excuse me, I am

This is a fine,

Captain Amazing.
What a surprise.

392
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,927
Really? I'm not
so sure about that.

393
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,666
Your first night of freedom,
and you blow up the asylum.

394
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,500
Interesting choice.
I knew you couldn't change.

395
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:12,937
I knew you'd know that.

396
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,072
Oh, I know that.

397
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,803
And I knew you'd know
I'd know you knew.

398
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:21,206
But I didn't.
I only knew that you'd know
that I knew.

Did you know that?

Oh, quick thought.

00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,860
Would you mind removing
the submicronic laser

405
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,463
in the ring on
the index finger
of your left hand?

Of course.
And, if it wouldn't be
too much trouble,

00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:43,034

You see, here in
Champion City,

419
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,233
we still do
a fairly brisk trade

in justice.

the publicity and keeping
your sponsors happy.

See, it's that kind
of cynicism that I truly feel

Oh, Lancie,

435
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,252
you really are so predictable.

00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,701

Yes, I know.

I was up all night,
trying to defend
the city from evil,

440
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,741
but I'm sure you don't
really care about that.

00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:34,078
Work starts at 0:00!
It's 0:25!

probably ruined by now.

Sucker, when are you gonna
tear down that jeep
like I told you to?

00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,953
I thought we went
through this yesterday.

445
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:45,723
That old jeep is actually
an armored car of some type.

446
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,192
It was meant to
withstand bombs. I can't just
rip it apart with a crowbar.

447
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,025
Just junk it.

448
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,730
If you gave me
the proper tools, I could...

449
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,721
Junk it!

450
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,735
I'm willing to have
this discussion with you,

451
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:01,297
but I think we should deal
with it like two people
who respect...

452
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,809
I want it junked.

00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,811
Okay.

454
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:09,212
Right now, I'm kind of like
a powder keg

455
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,716
and you're the match.

456
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:14,251
If you tell me to
junk it one more time...

457
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,620
Junk it now! You got that?

of Captain Amazing in
the search for Hunt,

00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:16,845
but have, so far, failed
to contact the city's
beloved superhero.

He makes a wonderful trophy,
don't you think?

I really think we need
to talk about your plans here.

Here are my plans, Lancie.

Tomorrow night,
I'm going to kill you.

469

Right. That's the part
that really doesn't work
for me.

00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,974
you will be dead,

472
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:47,503
and my city will be given
a new state of mind.

473
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,780
Clearly you gotta go with
what you're comfortable with,

474
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,583
but, I don't know,
I just keep coming back
to this place.

I'm spitballing here,
but maybe

476
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:59,423
we release the captain
to the authorities.

477
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,026
I say that you're
completely reformed.
Wink, wink.

478
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,028
There is rejoicing
in the streets.

479
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:08,532
At that point, you do
the whole destruction
of the city thing.

480
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,402
I mean, is it
a perfect plan? No.

481
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,305
And I think that's what
I like about it.

482
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,842
Jeez. Okay.

483
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:18,832
(DOOR SLAMMING)

484
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,446
That's great.
Turn off the lights now.

485
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,882
It was just an idea!
Wait, I got a better one.

486
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,285
You let me live,
I am your sidekick.

487
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:32,553
I'm like Amazing Boy
or... Casanova?

488
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,559
RAJA: Are you sure
Captain Amazing is in there?

489
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,654
FURIOUS: Yeah, I'm sure.
Let's go.

490
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,232
(SHUSHING)

491
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,065
(WHISPERING)
Wait! Hear that?

492
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:19,636
We must have hit
a trip wire.

493
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:22,606
It could be a photon
eviscerator heating up.

494
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:26,010
It could be a cybernetic
atom scrambler.
They target moving objects.

495
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:28,979
Sounds more like
a heat-seeking anthrax
projection gun to me.

496
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,848
Quickly,
cover your mouth.
No, let's bolt!

497
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,883
Don't move! Don't breathe!
Let's bolt!

498
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,185
Don't move! Don't breathe!

499
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,319
Let's bolt!

500
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,719
(EXCLAIMING)

501
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,356
It's the sprinkler.

502
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:46,330
Isn't that just fabu?
I'm positively soaked.

503
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:47,321
(SHUSHING)

504
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:53,137
What do we got here?

505
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:56,403
I think they're supposed to be
jive superheroes.

506
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,940
They made a big mistake
coming to Casanova's place.

507
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,103
(TITTERING)

508
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:05,916
What's so funny?

509
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,546
That's your power?
You have guns?

510
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:11,121
Couldn't you be a little more
creative than that?

511
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,057
Do forgive the impertinence,

512
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:16,060
but what the devil does
a pistol have to do
with disco?

513
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,161
Weak.

514
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,254
At best.

515
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,658
Check out the guy
with the pipe.
Are you the disco plumber?

516
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,636
There's no theme
at all here, mates.

517
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:29,073
Buddy, if you're gonna
carry a chain,
make it a gold chain.

518
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,775
See what I'm saying?
And that's just off
the top of my head.

519
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,377
Yo, what's up, Tiger Lily?

520
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:35,176
The top of your head, huh?

521
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:45,155
SHOVELER: We'll never
get in there. There are
too many Disco Boys.

522
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,259
FURIOUS: Look, I'm telling
you. Amazing's in there.
I saw him go in.

523
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,561
There's never any evil trios,
are there?

524
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:54,226
No, they've all got to travel
in gangs like little babies.

525
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,668
Maybe it's time
to level the playing field.

526
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:58,659
How?

527
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,206
I'm talking about recruiting.

528
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,075
There's plenty of guys
out there who would kill
to get in on our action.

529
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,144
Plenty of posers,
you mean.

530
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,512
Yeah, maybe a few.

531
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,415
But there's got to be
a couple of guys
out there, like,

532
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,350
like a human torch.

533
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:17,521
Or like a guy who can shoot
stinging foam into your eyes

534
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,252
or something like that.

535
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:22,960
There's the Sphinx,
of course.

536
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,061
The what?

537
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,362
The Sphinx.

538
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,530
I know this guy.

539
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:30,000
Big crime fighter
from down south.
Big-league hitter down there.

540
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,435
What's his power?

541
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:32,836
He's terribly mysterious.

542
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,539
That's it? That's his power?

543
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,041
He's mysterious?

544
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:39,076
Terribly mysterious.

545
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,738
Plus, he can, like,

546
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,814
cut guns in half
with his mind.

547
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:46,910
Really?
I hadn't heard that.
I think.

548
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,986
We'll have to track
this Sphinx guy down.

549
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:52,616
Meantime, I have an idea
where we can get another guy.

550
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,225
I'm free for lunch tomorrow.
How about you?

551
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,928
Nothing I couldn't
move around.

552
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:12,309
Why don't you guys
go on ahead?

553
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:15,177
I gotta take care
of something.

554
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,508
RAJA: Oh, I see.

555
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,151
FURIOUS: Good cause there,
saving homeless animals.

556
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,860
Yeah.

557
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:35,264
Hog queen?

558
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,334
What?

559
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,666
You're into motorcycles.

560
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,966
Oh. No. Not really.

561
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:44,403
'Cause I got a motorcycle.

562
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,311
Yeah, what kind?

563
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,579
It's a Harley.

564
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,638
A Harley.

565
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:54,952
Compatible. It's a Harley
compatible. Basically,
the same engineer.

566
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,521
Look,

567
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,355
I hope we're cool
about last night.

568
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,359
Last night?

569
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,058
Like I said,
I was kind of in
scary mode back there.

570
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:10,059
Sometimes that comes off
as a little threatening
or whatever.

571
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:11,935
I don't find you threatening.

572
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,406
You're very kind.

573
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:16,704
MONICA: At all.

574
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,710
Listen, I still feel like

575
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:23,113
I should make it up
to you somehow,
just in some way.

576
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:27,317
I should take you out
to dinner or something
to make up for being so scary,

577
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,419
or whatever.

578
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,717
I'm really busy.

579
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,292
Right.

580
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,631
Our little chess game
continues.

581
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,467
Yeah?

582
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,836
We're looking for the one
they call "The Invisible Boy."

583
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,274
All my life,
I've been ignored by people.

584
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,843
Finally, after years
of being overlooked,

585
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:56,212
I found I have
the power to disappear.

586
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,749
It's real ironic how
it happened 'cause...

587
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,740
Can we come in?

588
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,286
Yeah, sure. Come on.

589
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:03,387
Thank you.

590
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,619
Dad, I'm going to my room
with three strange men.

591
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,227
INVISIBLE BOY:
And that's pretty much it.

592
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,030
So, let me get this straight.

593
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:15,693
You do have the ability
to become invisible?

594
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,434
INVISIBLE BOY: Yes.

595
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,403
But you can't give us
a demonstration?

596
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,466
No, I can only
become invisible
when no one's watching.

597
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:27,377
So, you're only invisible
to yourself?

598
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:31,816
No. If I look at myself,
I become visible again.

599
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:38,379
So, you can only become
invisible when absolutely
nobody is watching you?

600
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,825
Yes.

601
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,453
Do forgive our incredulity,

602
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:48,257
but I'm wondering how you can
be certain you've achieved
transparency at all?

603
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:54,194
When you go invisible,
you can feel it.

604
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:57,908
I'm leaving.

605
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,276
Thanks a lot.
It was nice to have met you.

606
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,479
Wait, guys. Don't go.
Where you guys going?
Don't go.

607
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,449
Can I come?

608
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,618
Look, no offense, kid,

609
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,387
we're about to go up
against a really
powerful supervillain,

610
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,523
Casanova Frankenstein.

611
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:15,325
That means we gotta
find a lot of superheroes
really quickly.

612
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,794
And to tell you the truth,
we have no idea where
to even start, so...

613
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,593
I know tons of superheroes.

614
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:21,799
I'm sure
you know a lot...

615
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,900
No, no, no, seriously.

616
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:26,170
I'm out there all the time
at the costume shops,
martial arts stores

617
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:28,238
talking to guys
and making connections.

618
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,765
If you want to break in,
you gotta network,

619
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,844
and I know how to network.

620
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,142
Sorry, kid.

621
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,875
Come on.

622
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:39,375
Haven't you guys
ever been a kid?

623
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:43,051
Haven't you guys
ever had a dream?

624
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,731
Let me see,
who else have I met?
There's the Pincher.

625
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:55,799
"Pincher."

626
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,900
The Pickler.

627
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,368
Princess Headbutt.

628
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,470
White Flight and
the Black Menace.
They work together.

629
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,962
Slow down, slow down.

630
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,707
Then there's,
Professor Pink Belly,

631
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,243
and Lucky Pierre
and The French Tickler.

632
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,276
"French Tickler."

633
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,915
You've got all
their telephone numbers?

634
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,016
Yeah, most of them.

635
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,385
We've got to figure out a way
to get them all in one place.

636
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,854
That's quite right.

637
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,522
Some kind of a tryout.

638
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,013
Yes, a tryout.

639
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:23,293
Throw in a barbecue
and a couple of kegs,
they'll all show up.

640
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,596
The mooch factor's pretty high
with this crowd.

641
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:27,588
A barbecue,
that's a good idea.

642
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:32,236
What?
Bugger all, it's the Spleen.
Play dead.

643
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,303
Who's that?

644
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,102
Turn your head.
Don't say anything.

645
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,154
Hiya, fellas.

646
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:54,625
Word on the street is
you're looking
for superheroes.

647
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:55,726
Not really.

648
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,027
Actually,
we're just leaving.

649
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:59,096
Rotten luck.

650
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:01,265
Oh, here we go.

651
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:02,399
Perfect timing.

652
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,424
That's for you.

653
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:05,936
Hamburger, right?

654
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:07,029
Yes, thank you.

655
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:08,537
Enjoy.

656
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:12,509
Why are you guys
always dissing me?
It hurts my feelings.

657
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,845
I'm a superhero too.
I have powers.

658
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:17,247
Really? Like what?

659
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,715
So glad you asked.

660
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:19,783
Oh, no.

661
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:20,851
Excuse me.

662
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,615
Excuse me. Excuse me.

663
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:28,459
It all started
when I was just
13 years of age.

664
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,527
One day, while walking
with some friends,

665
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,895
I accidentally cut the cheese.

666
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:36,133
Well, in my
adolescent awkwardness,

667
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:39,661
I blamed it on an old gypsy
woman who happened
to be passing by.

668
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,862
Big mistake!

669
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:45,375
The gypsy woman placed a curse
upon my head.

670
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,311
Because I smelled it,

671
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:51,840
she decreed I would
forevermore be he
who dealt it!

672
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,750
Let me illustrate.

673
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:54,851
SHOVELER: No,
you don't have to.

674
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,787
It's not necessary, really.

675
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:00,791
Let's see.

676
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:04,057
Distance: 7 meters.

677
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,857
Air speed: Normal.

678
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:09,723
Compensate for
air conditioning.

679
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:12,903
Pull my fingers.

680
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:13,894
SHOVELER: Don't do it.

681
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,339
Oh, dear God.

682
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:20,067
S.B.D.!

683
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,120
Silent but deadly.

684
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:31,788
That's good shooting.

685
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:32,923
That was amazing!

686
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:35,359
It's disgusting.
Don't encourage him.

687
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,725
You guys are recruiting
for superheroes.

688
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,432
Where you holding
the tryouts?

689
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,900
We don't know yet,

690
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,734
as soon as we figure that out,
we'll get in touch
immediately.

691
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:51,706
Bet we'd get a big turnout
if we did it somewhere
with a swimming pool.

692
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:54,504
Oh, no. No, no, no.

693
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:58,407
Absolutely not. Nope. No.

694
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,056
I don't deserve this.

695
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:07,183
I know.

696
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,194
A lot of other men
I could have married.

697
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,496
I understand.

698
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:16,695
If one person vomits
in my pool,
I'm gonna divorce you.

699
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:18,862
That's fair.

700
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,038
Come on, kids!

701
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:29,341
State your name and power.

702
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,348
I am the Waffler.

703
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:34,618
With my griddle of justice,
I bash the enemy in the head

704
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,520
or I burn them like so.

705
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:37,587
(SIZZLING)

706
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,656
(EXCLAIMING) Don't do that.

707
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:43,860
I also have
my truth syrup,
which is low fat.

708
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,962
And I've been working
on a theme song.

709
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,865
Waffle man,
I am the Waffler

710
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:52,234
Golden crispy,
bad guys are history

711
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:56,039
And I'm running.
Just think about it.

712
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,508
Do you have a health plan?
Maybe dental? Eye?

713
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,576
Next.

714
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,569
Hi. I am Pencilhead.

715
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,548
And I am
Son of Pencilhead!

716
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,917
We erase crime.

717
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,051
Two generations of...

718
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,786
Right.
Yes, thank you.

719
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:10,887
Did I do all right?

720
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,789
Yeah, I think they liked us.

721
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,850
RAJA: Now, say...

722
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,254
I'm the Ballerina Man.

723
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:21,924
I don't need to see that.

724
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,366
Thanks.

725
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,342
I am...
Hey!

726
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,746
You copied me.
You copied me.

727
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:38,148
Did not!
Liar!

728
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:40,743
Ladies, now let's play nicely.

729
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,492
I'd say there's potential.

730
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:58,928
I be the Bullfighter.
I fight the bull!

731
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:02,236
Greetings,
fellow crime fighters.
I am Radio Man.

732
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,174
I am Squeegeeman.

733
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:05,442
Do you sense its power?

734
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:06,543
Yes.

735
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:11,106
P.M.S. Avenger.
I work 4 days a month.
Is there a problem with that?

736
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,849
No.
No.

737
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,917
Whatever you say.

738
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:15,085
We'll get back to you.

739
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:16,186
Quite all right.

740
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:17,287
Whatever.

741
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:18,881
Okay, that's it.

742
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:32,062
That was
a complete waste of time.

743
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,429
Like so many things we do.

744
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:40,210
Hi. Hi, you guys.
Am I too late to try out?

745
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:42,279
What time is it?
I don't have a watch on.

746
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,341
Yeah. Sorry. You'll have to
pretend to be a superhero
somewhere else.

747
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,781
Really? I see.

748
00:44:49,487 --> 00:44:51,421
That's fine.

749
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,434
Look out!

750
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:16,913
Look out!

751
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:30,492
I guess I'll just have to
take my ball and go home.

752
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:33,029
INVISIBLE BOY:
No. You can't go.
SHOVELER: Miss, please.

753
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,031
Where you going?
That was cool.

754
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,728
Wait. Stop her.

755
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,502
Hold on. Stop her.
Settle down.

756
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,338
That was great.

757
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:42,872
We might be able to squeeze in
one more interview.

758
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,709
Yes, seeing as how
you schlepped your ball
all this way.

759
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:46,843
Appreciate that. Thanks.

760
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,312
You're really good.

761
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,605
What's up?
I'm the Spleen.

762
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:53,617
I'm the Bowler.
How you doing?

763
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:55,245
You're very attractive.

764
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,254
BOWLER: That's because
it's ambrosia.

765
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:01,358
Why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself.

766
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,927
Help us understand why
we should choose you

767
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,062
over all the other
qualified applicants.

768
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,163
What other
qualified applicants?

769
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,860
Eddie, please.

770
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,665
Start at the top.
Where did you get your powers?

771
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,529
I got my powers
from my father.

772
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:17,470
Okay. Who's he?

773
00:46:17,742 --> 00:46:19,943
Have you ever heard of
Carmine the Bowler?

774
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,311
Have we ever heard...

775
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:25,281
Cor blimey, don't tell us
you're the Bowler's daughter.

776
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,618
I seem to remember there being
a little controversy
around his death.

777
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,420
That's right.
The police said
it was an accident.

778
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:33,623
He'd come home late one night
and fell down
an elevator shaft

779
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,191
onto some bullets.

780
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,395
I've always suspected
a bit of foul play.

781
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:40,023
As have I.

782
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:42,432
So now daddy's little girl
is all grown up,

783
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:44,768
looking for a little revenge,
is that it?

784
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:47,499
Yeah, that is it.
Is there a problem with that?

785
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,738
Why don't you tell me?

786
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:49,839
I don't know. You tell me.

787
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,708
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?

788
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:53,376
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?

789
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:56,446
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?

790
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:57,547
(SCOFFING)

791
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:58,538
(TAUNTING)

792
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,185

a pair of matching gloves
and boots.

So you're a British man
who converted to Islam
like Cat Stevens?

822
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:18,292
No. Until the early part
of this century, India was
part of the British Empire,

823
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:20,897
whose government there
was called the British Raj,

for "sovereignty."

you've inserted
your father's skull

832

inside of that ball
for bowling?

833
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:44,844
No. The guy at
the pro shop did it.

834
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,659
That was Casanova's limo.

You're the Sphinx.

952
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,828
And you are fools.

953
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:12,969
Tonight

954
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:15,000
you proved

955
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,765
your inexperience.

956
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,510
The wise man knows
that he is weakest

957
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,446
when he thinks himself strong.

958
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:25,815
Whoa.

959
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:27,648
This is serious.

960
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:29,742
Terribly mysterious.

961
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,887
Casanova Frankenstein

962
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,851
is no ordinary villain.

963
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:35,725
To fight him,

964
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:39,695
you must have
extraordinary skill.

965
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,231
Thank you for that
little piece of information.

966
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,000
I wouldn't have thought...

967
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,434
BOWLER: Excuse me!

968
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:47,136
Does anybody have any manners?

969
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,237
I don't know. Do I?

970
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,505
I don't know. Do you?
Do I?

971
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:50,840
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?

972
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:52,375
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?

973
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:54,310
I don't know. You tell me.
Do I mind what? Do I?

974
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:55,611
Silence!

975
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:58,681
We'll have to
separate you two.

976
00:56:58,682 --> 00:57:01,413
Is that what you want?
You want to be separated?

977
00:57:01,685 --> 00:57:03,084
He started it.

978
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:08,452
You must be
like the wolf pack,

979
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,894
not like the six pack.

980
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,659
Teamwork. Yes!

981
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:17,461
You were not ready to face
so great an enemy.

982
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:22,266
Not until you have vanquished
the enemy within yourselves.

983
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:23,696
Yes!

984
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,742
It's cool, isn't it?

985
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:30,313
It goes right up to
the point of being,
like, confusing.

986
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:34,410
It's leadership.
It's what we've been missing.

987
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,717
RAJA: Yes, I quite agree.

988
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:41,023
Sphinx, will you guide
our motley little gang
of men at arms?

989
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,793
Hey! Wait a minute.

990
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,728
Are you serious? Come on.

991
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:48,097
Will you shape us,
mold us?

992
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:51,133
Please unify us
and make us whole.

993
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,034
To learn my teachings,

994
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:56,198
I must first teach you

995
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,202
how to learn.

996
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,221
Learn to hide your strikes
from your opponent,

997
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:15,317
and you'll more easily
strike his hide.

998
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,769
How many weapons do you wield?

999
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:27,828
Just one, Sphinx.

1000
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:31,673
No. The fist, the knee,
the elbow, the head!

1001
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,609
You must lash out
with every limb

1002
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,170
like the octopus
who plays the drums.

1003
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,814
Why am I doing this again?

1004
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,388
When you can balance
a tack hammer on your head,

1005
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:48,586
you will head off your foes
with a balanced attack.

1006
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,461
And why am I wearing the
watermelon on my feet?

1007
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,668
I don't remember
telling you to do that.

1008
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:07,870
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait.

1009
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,789
I believe in my powers.

1010
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,296
I believe in my powers.

1011
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:34,798
I believe in the powers
of my teammates.

1012
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:38,165
I believe in the powers
of my teammates.

1013
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:40,910
I trust in my powers.

1014
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,845
I trust in my powers.

1015
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:45,846
I trust in the powers
of my teammates.

1016
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:49,745
I trust in the powers
of my teammates.

1017
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:54,390
This team must learn
to work together

1018
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:58,555
or, mark my words,
it will be torn apart!

1019
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,861
Now, gather round.

1020
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,894
Gather round.
Embrace one another.

1021
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:09,438
Gather round.
Embrace one another quickly.

1022
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,736
Roy.

1023
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:17,079
Why do you stand aside
while the others practice?

1024
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,878
"Practice?"

1025
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:21,584
That's not practicing.
That's group hugging.

1026
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:24,213
We should be busting in
on Casanova right now.

1027
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:28,981
He who questions training,
only trains himself
at asking questions.

1028
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:32,660
What?

1029
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:40,736
Who was looking for
the pinking shears?

1030
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:41,871
Oh, that was me.

1031
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:46,536
Yes, work well on
your new costumes, my friends.

1032
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,869
For when you care
for what is outside,

1033
01:00:50,514 --> 01:00:53,278
what is inside cares for you.

1034
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:55,417
The clock is ticking here.

1035
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:59,021
Are we gonna sew dresses
all day or are we gonna
rescue Amazing?

1036
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:00,723
I need a thimble.
Does anybody...

1037
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:02,091
Patience, my son.

1038
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:04,260
To summon your power for
the conflict to come,

1039
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:07,389
you must first have power
over that which conflicts you.

1040
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:11,327
Am I the only one
who finds these sayings
just a little formulaic?

1041
01:01:11,568 --> 01:01:14,203
"If you want to push something
down, you have to pull it up."

1042
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:16,272
"If you want to go left,
you have to go right."

1043
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:21,043
Your temper is very quick,
but until you learn
to master your rage...

1044
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,536
Your rage will
become your master?

1045
01:01:24,748 --> 01:01:26,482
That's what you
were gonna say, right?

1046
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:27,950
Right?

1047
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:29,248
Not necessarily.

1048
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,980
That's it. I'm out of here.

1049
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,891
Thanks for all the advice,
Mr. Misterioso, but it's time
to get busy with it.

1050
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,059
Come on, Eddie.
Let's go.

1051
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,127
No, Roy.

1052
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:39,595
I think he's getting results.

1053
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,463
Yeah, and the biggest one is
that we're all out of here.

1054
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:44,992
Come on, Jeff.
Let's peel some wheelies.
Let's go.

1055
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,803
I don't want to leave
the Sphinx.

1056
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:49,738
Okay, how about
the rest of you?

1057
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,441
Do you want to play
Suzie Homemaker with
Captain Conundrum

1058
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:54,536
or do you want
to be superheroes?

1059
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:06,180
Okay, I don't need
a compass to tell me
which way the wind shines.

1060
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:09,024
Roy, wait.
Let's talk about this.

1061
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,859
No, let's not talk about it!

1062
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,262
You want to sit here,
make Halloween outfits with
Little Red Riding Hood

1063
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:15,755
or you want to
take care of business?

1064
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:21,834
Well, I guess from now
on I ride in
a wolf pack of one.

1065
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,081
We should go after him.

1066
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:34,216
He's okay.
Just let him go.
He's a baby.

1067
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,385
We've never gone
into battle without him.

1068
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:38,053
If you love him so much,
why don't you marry him?

1069
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,922
I don't know.
Why don't you marry him?
Why don't you?

1070
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:41,523
Why don't you?
Why don't you?

1071
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:43,492
Bowler, Shoveler, please!

1072
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:48,497
Sphinx, what wisdom
can you give us in this,
our most clouded hour?

1073
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,193
Yeah, what do we do?

1074
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:54,069
The loss of manpower
can be replaced

1075
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,198
by the addition
of firepower.

1076
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:02,111
Well, I won't use guns.
I've been crystal clear
about that.

1077
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:03,445
He won't even
use a knife.

1078
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,015
You're not going to start
with that again, are you?

1079
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:08,007
Casanova will have
many weapons.

1080
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:12,911
To beat him, you will have
to have more than forks
and flatulence.

Why does he live in a
deserted amusement park?

1086
01:03:56,933 --> 01:03:58,992
Because he's
an eccentric genius.

1087
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:02,071
I'll take point.
You two flank.
Let's triangulate.

Equilateral or isosceles?

to rent a chicken?

This is weird in here.
It's scary and weird.

Half hour. Why?

maybe I could...

01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:27,162
The pleasure's all mine,
Frankenstein.

1264
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:30,198
We're about to perpetrate
some evil on these
Champion City people.

1265
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:32,701
Rapping,
snapping,
capping.

1266
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:37,435
Tonight, we are having quite
a party, a surprise party.

1267
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:40,999
I have a little something
up my sleeve,

1268
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:44,804
and I'm not just talking about
the wart on my elbow.

1269
01:14:50,353 --> 01:14:53,982
I have created
a beautiful machine

1270
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:57,454
that is going to encourage
our fellow citizens,

1271
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:00,729
to share my vision

1272
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,330
of the world!

1273
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,965
(CHEERING)

1274
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,627
Can you dig it?

1275
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,997
What about Captain Amazing?

1276
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:14,440
That is an excellent
question, Big Tobacco.

1277
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:19,344
What are we gonna do about
the greatest superhero
Champion City has ever known?

1278
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:24,477
For the answer,
I want you all
to walk this way.

1279
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:27,481
Dude, can we bring
the brewskis?

1280
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,793
Yes, of course.
You may absolutely
bring the brewskis.

1281
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,667
SPLEEN: Things look
pretty quiet to me.

(SNIFFING)

1283
01:15:47,143 --> 01:15:49,144
Invisible Boy,
did you just let one go?

1284
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:50,645
No, that wasn't me.

1285
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:51,807
Well, it wasn't me.

1286
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,115
Don't run! He'll shoot!

(GRUNTING)

1289
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,061
Is he doing what
I think he's doing?

1290
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:18,905
Just go with it.

1291
01:16:29,552 --> 01:16:30,819
BOWLER: (WHISPERING)
Can anybody see anything?

1292
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:31,986
AMAZING: Hey!

1293
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,755
FURIOUS: Who said, "Hey"?
SHOVELER: Not me.

1294
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,623
FURIOUS: Eddie, you don't
have to say, "Not me," okay?

1295
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:38,626
If someone says, "Who?"
And you say...

1296
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:40,391
AMAZING: Hey, morons,
over here.

1297
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,022
BLUE RAJA:
It's Captain Amazing!

1298
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,433
We've been looking for you.

1299
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,926
Turn on the light switch
behind you.

1300
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:54,999
My, my. Well, well.
We meet again, Captain?

1301
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:56,578
SHOVELER: We're here
to rescue you.

1302
01:16:56,579 --> 01:16:57,705
Yeah.

1303
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:02,083
I'm Blue Raja.
Do you recall me?
Master of silverware.

1304
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:04,919
You told me to keep up
the good work after
the Red Eye skirmish.

1305
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,356
I meet so many people
in this business,
but I think so.

1306
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:11,593
Could you two locate
the master ignition switch
on the main console?

1307
01:17:11,594 --> 01:17:13,728
Maybe you could open that up?

1308
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:15,697
Have you out in two shakes
of a lamb's tail.

1309
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:17,165
Frightfully
uncomfortable.
Great.

1310
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:18,433
BOWLER: How does this work?

1311
01:17:18,434 --> 01:17:20,068
I've seen one of these things.

1312
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:22,871
You've got to push
this thing in and twist it.

1313
01:17:22,872 --> 01:17:24,139
Don't force it!

1314
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,640
She's right,
my little friend.

1315
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,610
This contraption is, in fact,
a weapon of mass destruction.

1316
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:30,912
Casanova plans to turn it
against the city at midnight.

1317
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:32,881
Something's happening.

1318
01:17:33,349 --> 01:17:38,119
Okay, very good. On the wall
to your left you should see
two toggles side-by-side.

1319
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:41,249
"Toggles"? What do you mean?
You talking about switches?

1320
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:42,991
BOWLER: I see them, Captain.

1321
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,125
Thank you.

1322
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,660
Flip the first toggle.

1323
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,719
BOWLER: Flipping.

1324
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:50,298
Excellent work.

1325
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:51,366
Now, flip the...

1326
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:52,467
RAJA: Jolly good work, team!

1327
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:55,528
Could you just
stay over there, please?

1328
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:57,431
Of course.

1329
01:18:00,209 --> 01:18:01,472
Sorry.

1330
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,112
Now flip the second toggle.

1331
01:18:04,113 --> 01:18:05,513
Do as he says.

1332
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,539
The man knows
what of he speaks.

1333
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,351
I'm just gonna
ask you directly:

1334
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,320
Do you know billionaire
Lance Hunt?

1335
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:13,846
It's me.

1336
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,392
No, I'm kidding with you.
I've always wanted to do that.

1337
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:18,526
BOWLER: What's next?

1338
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,461
I just told you,
flip the second toggle.

1339
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:22,163
Again?

1340
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:23,222
What do you mean?

1341
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:25,500
Flip the toggle twice?

1342
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:26,668
No, no, no.

1343
01:18:26,669 --> 01:18:29,900
Don't do that.
Just flip it again now,
one time. Flip it.

1344
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:32,040
Does he understand
what I'm asking?

1345
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:36,477
Hold on a second.
Exactly how many
toggle flips in total,

1346
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:38,470
are involved
in this procedure?

1347
01:18:38,614 --> 01:18:42,380
I just... It's... Seven!

1348
01:18:42,985 --> 01:18:44,485
Seven?
Flip it!

1349
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:45,753
Seven?

1350
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:47,689
Everybody, hold the phone.

1351
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:51,626
You phrased that incorrectly.
We need to know how many
toggle flips are needed,

1352
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:54,762
not counting
the gratuitous toggle flip
you may have asked for

1353
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:55,830
in a moment of panic.

1354
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:56,764
Flip it!

1355
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,033
Could we just start again?

1356
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:01,069
Is there some sort of
reset button on this thing?

1357
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,638
AMAZING: No, you little freak,
there's no button
for resetting.

1358
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:05,540
Flip the switch, lady.
Don't stare at me.

1359
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:07,041
Lift your left arm.
Flip it, you moron!

1360
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:08,376
You're a moron!

1361
01:19:08,377 --> 01:19:09,477
I am not a moron.

1362
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,746
Do not call her a moron.
That's not cool.

1363
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:13,448
I will do it!

1364
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:15,149
Flip the switch, lady!
Don't look at me like that!

1365
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,948
It's this one, yes?

1366
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:20,411
Wrong switch.

1367
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:40,942
Everybody heard me say
"reset button," right?

1368
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,810
Oh, my God,
we killed him.

1369
01:19:44,213 --> 01:19:46,613
What do you mean "we"?
I was right here.

1370
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:03,996
I'm gonna check his pulse.

1371
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:11,339
I don't think
he's gonna pull through.

1372
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,832
SHOVELER: Somebody's coming.
We gotta get outta here.

1373
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:16,906
Everybody should just keep
holding their horses.

1374
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:20,649
BOWLER: Go, go, go.

1375
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,722
MAN: What the hell, man?

1376

(CURSING IN GERMAN)

1377
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:36,597
This sucker's dead.

1378
01:20:36,598 --> 01:20:38,396
What happened to him?

1379
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:44,196
As you can see,
I have taken Captain Amazing

1380
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:46,608
out of the picture.

1381
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:49,704
It's time for us to rule.

1382
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:56,317
Tonight at midnight,
I'm going to do to
Champion City

1383
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:58,844
what I have done
to its greatest superhero.

1384
01:20:59,755 --> 01:21:04,022
And there'll still be time
to go up, get down and boogie.

1385
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:07,128
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

1386
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:08,858
SPLEEN: Where's
Captain Amazing?

1387
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:10,965
RAJA: There's been
a bit of a cock-up.

1388
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:14,425
FURIOUS: Guys, I think we got
a little bigger fish to fry
right now.

1389
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:17,238
What the hell was
that machine in there?

1390
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,901
I don't know.
But I know where
we can go to find out.

1391
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:28,709
The vermin are back, Tony.

1392
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:33,247
Vermin should be
exterminated, Casanova.

1393
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:38,752
A fish fork is no match
for my machine!

1394
01:21:40,162 --> 01:21:42,995
But I think we should take out
some insurance.

1395
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:45,800
Don't you think?

1396
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:47,635
HELLER: It's
a psychofrakulator.

1397
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:51,973
It creates a cloud of
radically fluctuating
free-deviant chaotrons

1398
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:53,941
which penetrate
the synaptic relays.

1399
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:57,208
It's concatenated
with a synchronous
transport switch

1400
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,544
that creates
a virtual tributary.

1401
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:04,452
It's focused onto
a biobolic reflector.

1402
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:08,856
And what happens is that
hallucinations become reality

1403
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,759
and the brain is literally
fried from within.

1404
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,827
Where would you get
something like that?

1405
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:13,895
I don't know.

1406
01:22:13,896 --> 01:22:15,930
They used to say
it couldn't be built.

1407
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:19,734
The equations were so complex
that most of the scientists
who worked on it

1408
01:22:19,735 --> 01:22:21,202
wound up in the insane asylum.

1409
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:24,605
Which is where Casanova's been
hanging for the last 20 years.

1410
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:27,441
If he turned that thing
on the city, it'll waste
everything in sight.

1411
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,643
BOWLER: Not "if." When.

1412
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:29,811
We need Captain Amazing.

1413
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:32,079
Yes, but, unfortunately,
we just killed him.

1414
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,276
Unfortunately,
you killed him.

1415
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:36,184
Just because you're having
problems at home

1416
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:37,652
don't mean you can go around
killing people.

1417
01:22:37,653 --> 01:22:42,113
"Oh, sorry. Mummy.
I'm English.
I didn't mean it."

1418
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:45,126
K-I-L-L-E-D.
You killed him.

1419
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:47,662
You killed him. You did.
You were the one who
flicked the switch.

1420
01:22:47,663 --> 01:22:50,792
It's the same difference.
He's still dead.

1421
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:52,667
You did kind of...

1422
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:53,862
Sphinx!

1423
01:22:56,238 --> 01:22:58,940
What in heaven's name
do we do?

1424
01:22:58,941 --> 01:23:00,408
Sometimes,

1425
01:23:00,776 --> 01:23:04,974
the true hero is the one
with the courage to run away.

1426
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:07,281
I like the way
this man thinks.

1427
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:08,443
Let's run.

1428
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:10,551
We can't run.

1429
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:13,351
Oh, yes.
It's been established
that we can run.

1430
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:19,725
This is egg salad loaded
with cholesterol. The wife
won't even let me touch it.

1431
01:23:20,863 --> 01:23:25,300
Hardly seems to matter now.
'Cause chances are,
we're already dead.

1432
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:27,735
Amazing is gone.

1433
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:30,771
There's no use waiting
for the cavalry, because
as of this moment,

1434
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,740
the cavalry is us.

1435
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:34,709
Yeah, but I don't
wanna get frakulated.

1436
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,210
Psychofrakulated.

1437
01:23:36,211 --> 01:23:37,512
We still get frakulated.

1438
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,247
This is our fight,
whether we like it or not.

1439
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:40,815
Just we few.

1440
01:23:40,816 --> 01:23:43,046
We're not your
classic superheroes.

1441
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:46,250
We're not the favorites.
We're the other guys.

1442
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:49,782
We're the guys nobody
ever bets on.

1443
01:23:51,293 --> 01:23:53,027
But I tell you what I think.

1444
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:56,828
You and that ball of yours
have an appointment
that you've gotta keep.

1445
01:23:57,232 --> 01:23:59,997
Invisible Boy,
I think it's time
you were seen.

1446
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:02,696
Sphinx, you have
trained us well.

1447
01:24:03,305 --> 01:24:07,575
Dr. Heller, you might
just have given us
the edge we need.

1448
01:24:07,576 --> 01:24:10,636
Spleen, I don't wanna
stand behind you.

1449
01:24:10,946 --> 01:24:13,176
But I'll fight beside you
with pride.

1450
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:16,209
Jeff, you've got
a rare and beautiful gift.

1451
01:24:16,952 --> 01:24:19,717
The city needs you
tonight. And, Roy,

1452
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:21,689
in all the years
I've known you,

1453
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:24,182
I've never seen you
walk away from a fight.

1454
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:26,694
Why, you lifted
a city bus once, man.

1455
01:24:26,695 --> 01:24:29,926
I think you've got
what it takes
to handle Casanova.

1456
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:33,659
We're all in
over our heads,
and we know it.

1457
01:24:33,869 --> 01:24:37,038
But if we take on this fight,
those of us who survive it

1458
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:41,442
will forever after show
our scars with pride
and say, "That's right.

1459
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:44,677
"I was there.
I fought the good fight."

1460
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:46,747
So, what do you say?

1461
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:51,743
Do we all gather together and
go kick some Casanova butt,

1462
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:55,156
or do I eat this sandwich?

1463
01:24:55,157 --> 01:24:58,752
I say, what the fork.
Let's do it.

1464
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:02,697
If we're gonna bust
into that mansion,

1465
01:25:02,698 --> 01:25:04,332
you're gonna need more than
a station wagon.

1466
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:06,367
At the auto yard,
there's this old
Herkimer battle jitney.

1467
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:07,702
Sally's always telling me
to junk it.

1468
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:10,204
Wait. You have
a Herkimer battle jitney?

1469
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:13,374
That's the finest non-lethal
military vehicle ever made.

1470
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:16,210
All right, we'll meet
at the junkyard.
We'll go from there.

1471
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:18,578
I shall need more forks,
I'm afraid.

1472
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:21,615
Those of you with loved ones,
say good-bye before we go.

1473
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:23,585
You may not get
another chance.

1474
01:25:29,825 --> 01:25:31,759
Sei gesund.

1475
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:42,668
Hey, Mom.

1476
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:45,605
Jeffrey, what are you doing?

1477
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:48,068
I was just...

1478
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:57,579
I'm a superhero, Mother.

1479
01:25:58,186 --> 01:25:59,820
A superhero?

1480
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:02,056
An effete British superhero,
to be precise.

1481
01:26:02,057 --> 01:26:05,186
I am pilfering your tableware
because I hurl it.

1482
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:09,730
I hurl it with
a deadly accuracy.
The Blue Raja is my name.

1483
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:12,733
Yes, I know. I don't wear
much blue, and I speak
in a British accent.

1484
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:14,702
But if you know your history,
it really does
make perfect sense.

1485
01:26:14,703 --> 01:26:18,339
The point is, your boy's a
limey fork-flinger, Mother.

1486
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:21,208
Hard cheese to swallow,
but there it is.

1487
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:23,371
What will the bridge
club think?

1488
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:29,675
You need more forks?

1489
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:32,576
(GASPING)

1490
01:26:33,455 --> 01:26:36,516
These belonged to your
great-great grandmother.

1491
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:39,226
I was saving these
for your wedding day.

1492
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:44,222
But from the looks of it,
that day, it's probably
a long way off.

1493
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,463
Mom, you're taking this
incredibly well.

1494
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,305
I've always known
you were special,

1495
01:26:51,306 --> 01:26:55,209
but I just never realized
how special.

1496
01:27:00,816 --> 01:27:02,340
I'd better get going.

1497
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:04,452
I've got a city to save.

1498
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:06,182
Jeffrey?
Yeah?

1499
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:07,913
Do the accent.

1500
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:13,961
I'd love to stay and chitchat,
but I fear I must
away with me.

1501
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:17,164
Our metropolis is in
the clutches of madmen.

1502
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:19,500
Jeffrey? Cheerio.

1503
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:20,668
I really should get going.

1504
01:27:20,669 --> 01:27:22,034
Okay.

1505
01:27:25,307 --> 01:27:27,241
Thanks, Ma.

1506
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:39,312
I said I was
gonna leave you,
and I meant it.

1507
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:44,782
The city's in peril, Lucille.
We're the best hope
they've got.

1508
01:27:45,527 --> 01:27:48,087
Eddie, please don't start.

1509
01:27:48,563 --> 01:27:50,598
I don't expect you
to believe me.

1510
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:54,262
I just came by
to tell you that I love you.

1511
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:56,766
Tell the kids I love them.

1512
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:00,435
And now, good-bye.

1513
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:02,600
Good-bye, Eddie.

1514
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:06,241
I won't be here
when you come home.

1515
01:28:06,715 --> 01:28:08,883
Well, that's a chance
I'm gonna have to take.

1516
01:28:08,884 --> 01:28:12,684
Otherwise, there may not be
a home to come back to.

1517
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:24,360
Wish me luck.

1518
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:33,841
Hi.

1519
01:28:33,842 --> 01:28:34,942
Hi.

1520
01:28:34,943 --> 01:28:35,976
You okay?

1521
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:38,212
I wanted to say
I had a great time tonight.

1522
01:28:38,213 --> 01:28:40,381
And you were
really nice to me.

1523
01:28:40,382 --> 01:28:43,918
And I would love to,
to ask you out sometime.

1524
01:28:43,919 --> 01:28:47,388
But if I don't call you,
I want you to know
it's because I'm dead.

1525
01:28:47,389 --> 01:28:50,624
Me and my team,
we're gonna take on
Casanova Frankenstein.

1526
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:53,294
And it's pretty much
a suicide mission.

1527
01:28:53,295 --> 01:28:57,527
So, if there is anything that
you wanna say to me,

1528
01:28:57,799 --> 01:29:01,569
now would probably be
a good time to say it,
just 'cause...

1529
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:03,637
Yeah, I got
a question for you.

1530
01:29:03,638 --> 01:29:04,905
Cool. Kick it.

1531
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:06,602
What's your name?

1532
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:09,677
Do you mean
my secret identity?
'Cause I couldn't.

1533
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:12,408
No, I just,
you know, mean your name.

1534
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:15,239
My name.

1535
01:29:17,152 --> 01:29:18,346
Okay.

1536
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:23,515
It's Phoenix.

1537
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:27,024
Phoenix Dark.

1538
01:29:28,063 --> 01:29:30,361
Dirk. Phoenix...

1539
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:32,700
Dark-Dirk.

1540
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:36,103
It was...
I was christened Dirk Steele,

1541
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:37,371
and I changed it to Phoenix.

1542
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:39,500
Forget about it.
It's okay.

1543
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:47,848
It's Roy.

1544
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:51,645
That's my name.
My name is...

1545
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:55,489
My real name is Roy.

1546
01:30:15,043 --> 01:30:17,637
Just be Roy.

1547
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:31,525
Roy, the Roy. Yes, I'm Roy.

1548
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:33,193
Who is Roy? Roy is who?

1549
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:35,062
He's freaking out, man.

1550
01:30:35,063 --> 01:30:37,798
Where's the guy who pretends
not to be Roy?

1551
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:39,967
We've had quite enough
of that. Just stop it.

1552
01:30:39,968 --> 01:30:42,970
Just snap out of it.
We're tired of it.

1553
01:30:42,971 --> 01:30:47,431
I'm a wannabe. A true wannabe,
in the worst sense of the...

1554
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:49,677
You guys are gonna have to go
fight this battle without me.

1555
01:30:49,678 --> 01:30:52,179
You start doubting
your super powers,
you are shafted.

1556
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:55,683
If I had any super powers,
I guess I would be
in trouble, but I don't.

1557
01:30:55,684 --> 01:30:57,311
What do I do?
I go...

1558
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:58,686
(GROWLING)

1559
01:30:58,687 --> 01:31:01,121
What are you talking about?
You lifted a bus once.

1560
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:03,991
Precisely.
That story's legendary.

1561
01:31:03,992 --> 01:31:07,087
It was really more of a push,
really, than a lift.

1562
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:10,026
That still takes incredible
superhuman strength.

1563
01:31:10,398 --> 01:31:12,833
It does, to push
an entire bus out the way.

1564
01:31:12,834 --> 01:31:15,903
Actually, the driver
kind of had his foot
on the accelerator,

1565
01:31:15,904 --> 01:31:18,105
just in the beginning,
just to get it going,

I get the girl.

1722
01:44:33,868 --> 01:44:36,064
No!

1723
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:07,566
Don't worry.
It will all be over
so very quickly.

1724
01:45:12,006 --> 01:45:13,339
What are you doing?

1725
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:16,009
They must have ripped
the "Q" section
out of my dictionary,

1726
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:19,275
'cause I don't know
the meaning of
the word "quit."

1727
01:45:20,447 --> 01:45:22,313
(HISSING)

1728
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:36,255
You want
a little fisticuffs? Okay.

1729
01:45:39,967 --> 01:45:41,628
Get him, Roy.

1730
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:48,536
Come on, Roy!

1731
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:04,324
It's the funkyskunkulator!

1732
01:46:04,325 --> 01:46:05,458
We've got to stop it.

1733
01:46:05,459 --> 01:46:07,052
Don't touch any toggles.

1734
01:46:08,729 --> 01:46:11,357
FURIOUS: Rage taking over.

1735
01:46:11,498 --> 01:46:13,933
Ja. We've heard
all that before.

1736
01:46:15,569 --> 01:46:16,969
No, no.

1737
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,730
Rage really taking over.

1738
01:47:10,357 --> 01:47:13,156
Frak-you later, Frankenpuss.

1739
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:21,995
Yeah!

1740
01:47:40,587 --> 01:47:42,146
Get out of here.

1741
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:49,122
Hit the deck.

1742
01:47:52,966 --> 01:47:55,026
How do we shut
this thing down?

1743
01:47:56,003 --> 01:47:58,237
Group hug!

1744
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:00,036
Yeah! Okay!
Yeah!

1745
01:48:05,913 --> 01:48:07,013
Hurry up!

1746
01:48:07,014 --> 01:48:08,846
Get her closer to the hole!

1747
01:48:12,286 --> 01:48:14,948
Dad, this is the way
it has to be.

1748
01:48:15,255 --> 01:48:18,657
The upshot is you won't
be killed because
you're already dead.

1749
01:48:18,859 --> 01:48:20,693
No, I'm not going with you.

1750
01:48:20,694 --> 01:48:24,597
If there's a time
for separation, let me tell
you something, this is it.

1751
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:25,732
Lift me up.

1752
01:48:25,733 --> 01:48:26,799
FURIOUS: Push her up.

1753
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:29,769
SHOVELER: Help me lift her up.
Help her.

1754
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:33,502
INVISIBLE BOY:
You can do it. Hold on.

1755
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:38,244
FURIOUS: Do it!

1756
01:48:38,245 --> 01:48:39,406
I love you, Dad!

1757
01:48:50,157 --> 01:48:52,225
Run! Run!

1758
01:48:52,226 --> 01:48:53,489
Let's get out of here!

1759
01:48:53,627 --> 01:48:55,721
Run for your lives!

1760
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:01,299
Run!

1761
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:11,000
Go!

1762
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:21,481
Go! Go!

1763
01:49:33,834 --> 01:49:36,636
NEWSCASTER ON TV: No one
could survive the chaos
we've just witnessed here.

1764
01:49:36,637 --> 01:49:40,630
But as the dust begins
to settle over the ruins
of the Casanova's mansion,

1765
01:49:40,941 --> 01:49:43,009
the question remains.

1766
01:49:43,010 --> 01:49:47,072
Who were these brave heroes
that gave their lives
to save our city tonight?

1767
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:50,283
Did that frakulator work,
or what?
What's the deal there?

1768
01:49:50,284 --> 01:49:52,618
MAN: Look. Something's moving.
People are coming out.

1769
01:49:52,619 --> 01:49:54,520
MAN: Could you tell us
what's going on?

1770
01:49:54,521 --> 01:49:56,055
NEWSCASTER: Hi. Excuse me.

1771
01:49:56,056 --> 01:49:59,026
Can you tell us
what happened here tonight?

1772
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:00,860
INVISIBLE BOY: We did it.
BOWLER: We won.

1773
01:50:00,861 --> 01:50:02,056
Hey, that's my team.

1774
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:05,793
We struck down evil with
the mighty sword of teamwork

1775
01:50:06,033 --> 01:50:07,633
and the hammer
of not-bickering.

1776
01:50:07,634 --> 01:50:10,970
We are number one.
All others are number two
or lower.

1777
01:50:10,971 --> 01:50:12,370
REPORTER: Who are you guys?

1778
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:14,407
They call me the Shoveler.

1779
01:50:14,408 --> 01:50:16,843
That's my dad.

1780
01:50:18,011 --> 01:50:19,579
My hero.
I'm the Bowler.

1781
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:20,706
Hello.

1782
01:50:23,484 --> 01:50:26,586
Blue Raja,
master of silverware. Hi, Mom.

1783
01:50:26,587 --> 01:50:29,454
I mean, cheerio, Mummy.

1784
01:50:29,723 --> 01:50:31,324
Jeffrey.

1785
01:50:31,325 --> 01:50:32,492
REPORTER: And you, sir.

1786
01:50:32,493 --> 01:50:34,760
What's your name
and your superpower?

1787
01:50:34,761 --> 01:50:35,751
My name's Roy.

1788
01:50:36,797 --> 01:50:39,599
I'm in a super amount of pain
right now. Could you please
leave me alone?

1789
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:44,103
His name's Mr. Furious,
and his power comes from
his boundless rage.

1790
01:50:44,104 --> 01:50:48,074
Excuse me. Could I say
something? I think we would
all like this victory

1791
01:50:48,075 --> 01:50:50,209
to go out to
all the other guys.

1792
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:52,912
I'm talking about the people
in this city who are super
good at their jobs

1793
01:50:52,913 --> 01:50:56,182
but never get any credit,
like the lady in the D.M.V.

1794
01:50:56,183 --> 01:50:57,483
That's a rough job.

1795
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:58,684
To the people
that remember jingles

1796
01:50:58,685 --> 01:51:00,686
from tons of old commercials.

1797
01:51:00,687 --> 01:51:03,389
And people that support
local music and seek out
independent film.

1798
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:06,692
And the guy that drives
the snow plow.
And the school nurse...

1799
01:51:06,693 --> 01:51:08,594
Eddie, Eddie,
I think they got the point.

1800
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:10,463
What's the name of this group?

1801
01:51:10,464 --> 01:51:11,731
INVISIBLE BOY:
The Super Dudes.

1802
01:51:11,732 --> 01:51:13,432
No, not the Super Dudes.

1803
01:51:13,433 --> 01:51:16,769
We don't have a name yet,
but definitely not
the Super Dudes.

1804
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:18,571
SHOVELER: I gotta get home.
It's late.

1805
01:51:18,572 --> 01:51:20,802
Picture, picture time.

1806
01:51:23,677 --> 01:51:27,446
Whatever you call them,
Champion City will forever
owe a debt of gratitude

1807
01:51:27,447 --> 01:51:29,439
to these mystery men.

1808
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:34,610
Wait. That's it.
We are the Super Squad.

1809
01:51:35,055 --> 01:51:39,993
No! Alliteration in
these situations is corny.

1810
01:51:40,627 --> 01:51:44,597
What? Yes, we're all
very aware that you
saved the day,

1811
01:51:44,598 --> 01:51:48,626
and I'm sure we'll be
hearing about it
for the rest of our lives.
