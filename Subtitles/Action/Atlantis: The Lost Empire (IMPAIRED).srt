MILO: Good afternoon,
gentlemen.

8
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:40,930
First off, I'd like
to thank this board...

9
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:43,238
for taking the time
to hear my proposal.

10
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:45,403
Now, we've all heard
of the legend ofAtlantis...

11
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:47,743
a continent somewhere
in the mid-Atlantic...

12
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:49,840
that was home
to an advanced civilization...

13
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:52,408
possessing technology
far beyond our own...

14
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,818
that, according
to our friend Plato here...

15
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:57,255
was suddenly struck
by some cataclysmic event...

16
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,917
that sank it
beneath the sea.

17
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,860
Now, some of you may ask,
why Atlantis?

18
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:03,487
It's just a myth, isn't it?

19
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,758
Pure fantasy.

20
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:08,165
Well, that is
where you'd be wrong.

21
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:10,294
1 0,000 years
before the Egyptians...

22
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:11,304
built the pyramids...

23
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:14,364
Atlantis had electricity,
advanced medicine...

24
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:16,602
even the power of flight.
Impossible, you say?

25
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:18,270
Well, no.
No, not for them.

26
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:20,279
Numerous ancient cultures
all over the globe agree...

27
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:23,180
that Atlantis possessed
a power source ofsome kind...

28
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:25,616
more powerful than steam,
than--than coal.

29
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:26,879
More powerful than
our modern...

30
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:28,284
internal combustion engines.

31
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:32,052
Gentlemen, I propose
that we find Atlantis...

32
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:33,923
find that power source...

33
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,791
and bring it back
to the surface.

34
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:39,026
Now, this is a page
from an illuminated text...

35
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:42,262
that describes a book called
the Shepherd's Journal...

36
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:44,463
said to have been
a first-hand account...

37
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:46,768
ofAtlantis
and its exact whereabouts.

38
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:49,866
Now, based on a centuries-old
translation of a Norse text...

39
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,606
historians have believed
the Journal resides in lreland.

40
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:55,581
But after
comparing the text...

41
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:58,607
to the runes
on this Viking shield...

42
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:01,052
I found that
one of the letters...

43
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:02,554
had been mistranslated.

44
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:04,988
So, by changing this letter...

45
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,152
and inserting
the correct one...

46
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:08,490
we find that
the Shepherd's Journal...

47
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:10,120
the key to Atlantis...

48
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:14,099

00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:27,973
Did you really
know my grandfather?

165
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:31,074
Oh, yeah. Met old Thaddeus
back in Georgetown.

166
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,277
Class of '66.
We stayed close friends...

167
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:34,479
till the end of his days.

168
00:09:34,554 --> 00:09:36,545
[Grunting]
Even dragged me along...

169
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:38,420
on some ofhis
danged fool expeditions.

170
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,926
Thatch was crazy
as a fruit bat, he was.

171
00:09:40,994 --> 00:09:42,256
He spoke ofyou often.

172
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:44,354
Funny. He--he never
mentioned you.

173
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:45,364
Oh, he wouldn't.

174
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:46,695
He knew how much
I liked my privacy.

175
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:48,625
[Grunting]

176
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:50,067
I keep a low profile.

177
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:52,162
Mr. Whitmore, should I be
wondering why I'm here?

178
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:53,331
Look on that table.

179
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:55,975
WHITMORE: Ah!

180
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,670
It's for you.

181
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,440
It's--it's from my grandfather.

182
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,141
He brought that package
to me years ago.

183
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:03,978
He said if anything
were to happen to him...

184
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:05,006
I should give it to you...

185
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:06,018
when you were ready--

186
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:08,646
whatever that means.

187
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:10,552
MILO: lt--

188
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,354
It can't be.
It's the Shepherd's Journal.

189
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:16,157
Mr. Whitmore,
this journal is the key...

190
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:18,686
to finding the lost
continent of Atlantis!

191
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:21,825
Atlantis! Ha ha ha!
I wasn't born yesterday, son.

192
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:23,130
No, no, no.
Look--Iook at this.

193
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:25,660
Coordinates. Clues.
It's all right here.

194
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:27,366
Yeah, looks like
gibberish to me.

195
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:28,874
That's because it's
been written in a dialect...

196
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:30,239
that no longer exists.

197
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:32,506
-So it's useless.
-No, no, just difficult.

198
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,513
I've spent my whole life
studying dead languages.

199
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:36,014
It's not gibberish to me.

200
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:37,277
Ah, it's probably a fake.

201
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:40,816
Mr. Whitmore, my grandfather
would have known...

202
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:42,855
if this were a fake.
I would know.

203
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:45,881
I will stake everything I own,
everything that I believe in...

204
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:48,052
that this is the genuine
Shepherd's Journal.

205
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:49,186
All right,
all right.

206
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:50,296
So what do you want
to do with it?

207
00:10:50,296 --> 00:10:51,820
Well, I'll--I'll--
I'll get funding.

208
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:53,388
I mean, I'll--The museum--

209
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:54,400
WHITMORE: They'll
never believe you.

210
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:57,301
I'll show them!
I will make them believe.

211
00:10:57,337 --> 00:10:58,326
Like you did today?

212
00:10:58,371 --> 00:11:00,737
Yes! Well, no.
How did you...

213
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:02,604
Forget about them,
OK? Never mind!

214
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:04,507
I will find Atlantis
on my own.

215
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:06,307
I mean, if I have
to rent a rowboat!

216
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:09,111
Congratulations, Milo.

217
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:11,810
This is exactly
what I wanted to hear.

218
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:13,408
But forget the rowboat, son.

219
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:17,353
We'll travel in style.

220
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:23,086
It's all been arranged,
the whole ball of wax.

221
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:24,118
Why?

222
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:25,790
For years your granddad
bent my ear...

223
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:27,322
with stories
about that old book.

224
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:28,698
I didn't buy it for a minute.

225
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:29,997
So finally I got fed up...

226
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,230
and made a bet
with the old coot.

227
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,204
I said, "Thatch, if you
ever actually find...

228
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,263
"that so-called journal...

229
00:11:34,307 --> 00:11:35,831
"not only will I
finance the expedition...

230
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,365
"but I'll kiss you
full on the mouth."

231
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,434
Imagine my embarrassment...

232
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:40,810
when he found
the darn thing.

233
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:42,940
Now I know your
grandfather's gone, Milo...

234
00:11:42,982 --> 00:11:45,246
God rest his soul,
but Preston Whitmore...

235
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:46,717
is a man who keeps his word.

236
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:47,720
You hear that, Thatch?

237
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:48,846
I'm going to the afterlife...

238
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:51,219
with a clear conscience,
by thunder!

239

[Sighs]

241
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:00,889
Your grandpa was a great man.

242
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,924
You probably don't
realize how great.

243
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:06,871
Those buffoons at the museum
dragged him down...

244
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:08,339
made a laughingstock of him.

245
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,267
He died a broken man.

246
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,643
If I could bring back
just one shred of proof...

247
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,147
that'd be enough for me.

248
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,041
Ah, Thatch.

249
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:21,485
What are we
standing around for?

250
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:22,510
We got work to do.

251
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:24,112
But, Mr. Whitmore, you know,
in order to do...

252
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,817
what you're proposing,
you're gonna need a crew.

254
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:28,827
You'll need engineers
and--and geologists.

Don't let her age fool you.

261
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:41,903
She's forgotten more
about engines...

262
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:43,465
than you or I will ever know.

263
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:45,238
They're the same crew that
brought the Journal back.

264
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:46,245

So it's decision time.

269
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:57,146
You can build on the foundation
your grandfather left you...

270
00:12:57,223 --> 00:12:59,191
or you can go back
to your boiler room.

have to quit my job.

Your granddad had a saying.

00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:23,546
"Our lives are remembered...

in the Book of Job.

to the Journal...

456
00:20:12,658 --> 00:20:14,626

will take us down a tunnel...

457

at the bottom of the ocean,
and we'll come up a curve...

00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:18,623
into an air pocket
right here...

459

until I was older...

that I realized
that the arrowhead...

747

was just
some compressed shale...

01:32:53,448 --> 01:32:55,848
Oh, yeah

1765
01:32:55,884 --> 01:32:59,911
There's a world
that waits for you

1766
01:32:59,954 --> 01:33:02,650
You're not alone

1767
01:33:02,724 --> 01:33:05,625
You'll find your home

1768
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:07,127
Where the dream takes you

1769
01:33:07,195 --> 01:33:10,995
Try to change your mind

1770
01:33:11,032 --> 01:33:12,932
Where the dream takes you

1771
01:33:12,967 --> 01:33:16,801
Try to change your heart

1772
01:33:16,838 --> 01:33:18,669
Where the dream takes you

1773
01:33:18,706 --> 01:33:23,666
But you must go

1774
01:33:23,711 --> 01:33:25,076
Where the dream
takes you
