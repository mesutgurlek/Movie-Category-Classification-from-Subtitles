With human head.

Yeah. He eats dogs

Does he?

54
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:13,036
Sean thought him up.
You see, sir,

55
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:14,837
we kinda have
this monster club, okay?

56
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:17,340
And we draw those pictures to put
on our clubhouse walls.

57
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:19,108
Correction,
Mr. Crenshaw.

58
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:22,378
You draw pictures
during Mrs. Carlson's science class

59
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,547
when you're supposed
to be paying attention.

60
00:07:24,548 --> 00:07:26,149
Wait. I just want
to say one thing.

61
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,851
I mean, Ms. Carlson's
a nice teacher and all,

62
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:31,154
but she's boring and
has an odd-shaped head.

63
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:33,189
That's why Sean and the guys
call her "Meow Mix,"

64
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,191
'cause her head's
shaped like a cat head.

65
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:37,527
But I don't, sir,
'cause-- how rude.

[chuckles]

70
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:47,537
I was a kid once.

71
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:49,672
I thought monsters
were cool.

72
00:07:49,673 --> 00:07:51,607
And maybe, well--
well, gosh...

73
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:52,942
maybe I'm
just a big kid,

74
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:54,043
because, Sean, Patrick...

75
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:57,780
...I think science

76
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:58,548
is cool.

77
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:01,851

79
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:05,655
Now, I'm sure
both of you know

80
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:07,190
a great deal
about monsters,

81
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:09,058
but that's not the issue here.
The issue is...

82
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:12,862
...science is real.

83
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:14,564
Monsters are not.

84
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,034
We don't
know that, sir.

85
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,806
God, can you believe
Mr. Metzger?

86
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,676
Tell me about it. He touched me
and patted my shoulders and stuff.

87
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:27,877
The guy was fully
homo-ing out.

88
00:08:27,878 --> 00:08:29,245
I smell like the '40s.

89
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:30,780
I mean, when they send you to school,
why don't they

90
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:33,182
tell you about the homos and
people with cat heads--

91

Ooh!
Oh!

92

Oh, my God! Some guy
kisses her at night?

96
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,735
I mean, a priest said,
"I now pronounce you man and wife,"

97
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:53,903
and it was
okay with him?

98
00:08:53,904 --> 00:08:54,604
Hey.
Where's Fat Kid?

99
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:01,077
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to our show.

Tonight's question:
What makes Fat Kid fat?

101
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:04,781
Fat kid?

102
00:09:04,782 --> 00:09:06,382
Get out of here,
E.J.

103
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:07,784
"Get out of here, E.J."
Nope.

104
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:09,419
Not a good answer.
Doesn't make any sense.

105
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,320
Let's go to our man on the street. Derek.
Hi. I'm Derek,

106
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:13,389
and I'm in the street
where Fat Kid is blocking traffic.

107
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,624
Fat Kid, can't you
stop eating?

108
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,630
Look, I have
a glandular problem, okay?

109
00:09:20,631 --> 00:09:23,633
At least I don't have a...
stupidity problem.

Oops.
I tore it.

115
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:38,081
I guess I must have
a stupidity problem.

[whispers]
What'd you say, faggot?
What'd you say?

117
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:43,186

"You're an asshole."

Wolfman cannot drive a car.
Yes, he can.

No, he can't!
Yes, he can.

136
00:10:57,528 --> 00:10:59,696
All I'm saying is,
Sean, he could if he had to.

137
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:01,230
He could not. You're
being such a dork!

138
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:02,699

What are you
talkin' about?

145
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:14,143
He walks around.
He wears pants.

146
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:17,380
He had to wear pants
'cause those movies
were made in the '40s.

147
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:19,382
He had to wear 'em
so you wouldn't see his--

wolf dork.

00:11:32,229 --> 00:11:33,596

Sean, he give me
the creeps.

Oh, he's just
a dude on welfare.

Maybe he's
a German spy.

Oh, good one.
We're not at war

Do you think we could
talk him into joining
the Monster Club?

Can we?

00:29:02,312 --> 00:29:03,446
Wha?

484
00:29:03,447 --> 00:29:05,982
There's a monster
in my closet.

485
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,454
Damn, son, look!

486
00:29:11,455 --> 00:29:13,456
All of these monsters!

487
00:29:13,457 --> 00:29:15,124
Come on,
all of you monsters,
outta here!

488
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:17,560
Everyone,
out of this room!
Come-- Ahh, ahh!

489
00:29:17,561 --> 00:29:20,830
You, on the bed.
Come on. Out. Out.
Take a hike.

490
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:21,497
There he goes.

491
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:24,133
[sighs]

492
00:29:24,134 --> 00:29:25,001
You see
any more monsters?

493
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:31,507
In the closet?

494
00:29:32,976 --> 00:29:34,977
Sure. We can go
into the closet.

495
00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:36,012
We can do that.

496
00:29:38,148 --> 00:29:40,016
Okay, monsters!

497
00:29:41,985 --> 00:29:43,786
Whoo!

498
00:29:43,787 --> 00:29:46,322
Look at that big,
scary monster!

499
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:47,523
Ooh!

500
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:51,494
Listen. You are
not gonna sleep

501
00:29:51,495 --> 00:29:52,628
with your mother
and me tonight,

502
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:53,796
so you can
forget it.

503
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:55,264
And keep this up,

504
00:29:55,265 --> 00:29:57,567
and you're not gonna look
at those monster magazines.

505
00:29:57,568 --> 00:29:58,534
Understand?

506
00:30:04,074 --> 00:30:05,541
[closet door opens]
Uhh?

507
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,419
Okay.
We're all here.

508
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,687
What's
the deal?

509
00:30:17,688 --> 00:30:19,655
Yeah.
What the hell's
Monster Squad?

510
00:30:19,656 --> 00:30:21,024
It's us.

511
00:30:21,025 --> 00:30:22,759
We're
the Monster
Squad.

512
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,793
Since when?

513
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:24,861
Since now!

514
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:26,863
What's a "squad"?

515
00:30:26,864 --> 00:30:28,064
<i>It's like
Miami Vice, I think.</i>

516
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,534
Look. I think
there's monsters.

517
00:30:31,535 --> 00:30:32,702
Like, real ones.

518
00:30:32,703 --> 00:30:34,370
I heard my dad talking
on the telephone

519
00:30:34,371 --> 00:30:35,905
to a guy down
at the police station.

520
00:30:35,906 --> 00:30:38,274
There was a guy screaming
he was a werewolf.

521
00:30:38,275 --> 00:30:41,344
And they shot him.
And the body disappeared
from the coroner van.

522
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:43,212
And the coroner guy
was dead.

523
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:46,315
So what? He got shot,
and the werewolf
took his body?

524
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:49,819
<i>No, you pinhead!
He was a werewolf!
Maybe.</i>

525
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,953
But if they shot him...

526
00:30:50,954 --> 00:30:52,255
They must've been
regular bullets,

527
00:30:52,256 --> 00:30:54,057
not silver ones.

528
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:56,025
Look, I know
this will sound
pretty stupid,

529
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:58,828
but a mummy disappeared
from the museum tonight.

530
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:01,097
Mummy came
in my house.

531
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:05,068
And, guys...

532
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:06,602
Dracula might
be here, too.

533
00:31:08,305 --> 00:31:10,306
Aw, man,
Fat Kid farted!

534
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:11,674
Oh, God.
Did not.

535
00:31:11,675 --> 00:31:13,743
Can't you
hold it? God!

536
00:31:13,744 --> 00:31:16,479
God damn it,
would you shut up?

537
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,814
Did you hear
a word I said?

538
00:31:17,815 --> 00:31:20,249
The guys are dead!
Get a clue!

539
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,151
Something's out there,
and it's killin' people!

540
00:31:22,152 --> 00:31:25,121
And if it's monsters,
nobody's gonna do a thing
about it but us.

541
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:28,624
So, what do we do?

542
00:31:30,194 --> 00:31:31,761
Think this book
might be important.

543
00:31:31,762 --> 00:31:33,229
Look. It's
Van Helsing's diary.

544
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,764
Mom said they found it
in an old house

545
00:31:34,765 --> 00:31:36,432
on Shadowbrook Road.

546
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:38,334
But I can't read it.
It's all in German.

547
00:31:38,335 --> 00:31:40,269
My sister takes German
in high school.

548
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,538
Your sister
doesn't speak German.
All she does

549
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,041
is hang around,
and the guys
touch her tits.

550
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:46,943
Your sister wouldn't
happen to live next-door,
would she?

551
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,277
So what?

552
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:50,113
That girl's
your sister?

553
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:54,650
So, what do you say?
Are we Monster Squad...

554
00:31:55,953 --> 00:31:56,652
...or what?

555
00:32:03,127 --> 00:32:05,094
Cool.
All right.

get up here, anyways?

so listen
very carefully.

566
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,735
Van Helsing's diary...

567
00:33:19,903 --> 00:33:20,737
...is missing.

568
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:23,740
I want you
to retrieve it
for me.

569

I want you
to find them
and take the diary.

574

If they do not
cooperate...

Gentlemen, I'd just like
to say three words:

577
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:53,269
Scary German Guy.

578
00:33:56,907 --> 00:33:58,775
Who else are we
gonna get to translate
this thing?

579
00:34:01,245 --> 00:34:03,079
Come on. Somebody
go up and knock.

580

<i>You knock.
You're our leader.</i>

581
00:34:08,452 --> 00:34:09,852
[Fat Kid]
Firstly, he's scary, okay?

582
00:34:09,853 --> 00:34:12,255
And "B,"
he's German.

583
00:34:12,256 --> 00:34:14,457
Maybe he doesn't
even speak English.

584
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:16,292
Okay, so what's
German for...

Thanks, Mister, uh, guy.

were we?

<i>Ah... ja.</i>

"The amulet itself
is fairly small

and carved with

601
00:35:18,622 --> 00:35:19,355
Oh.

602
00:35:20,724 --> 00:35:22,125
Rather an odd-looking
thing,

603
00:35:22,126 --> 00:35:23,426
don't you think?

00:35:23,427 --> 00:35:25,094
Scary German
Guy's bitchin'.

605
00:35:25,095 --> 00:35:27,497
Sir, the thing
I don't understand is

606
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:28,798
the part about
the equilibrium.

607
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:31,100
Well, according
to this rather
curious book

608
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:32,535
you have
brought me,

609
00:35:32,536 --> 00:35:35,972
"The forces
of good and evil--"

610
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:39,776
Uh, that is a B-17,
in case you are
wondering.

611
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:40,376
It's rad!

612
00:35:41,812 --> 00:35:42,812
"Good and evil

613
00:35:42,813 --> 00:35:44,280
"are
in constant flux,

614
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:45,481
"back and forth.

00:35:45,482 --> 00:35:48,418
"Only once,

00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:52,588
And what about
the amulet?

618
00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:56,526
The amulet,
so nearly as I
can translate,

619
00:35:56,527 --> 00:36:00,697
is "concentrated good.

620
00:36:00,698 --> 00:36:02,231
"It is a talisman

621
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:06,369
which wards off evil
and is..."

622
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,904
how you say, uh...

623
00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:11,040
"indestructible"?

624
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,909
That means
it can't be
destroyed.

625
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,711
Or, in any case,

626
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:17,814
normally destroyed.
However,

627
00:36:17,815 --> 00:36:20,550
and this part
is underlined...

628
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:24,153
"Once
every hundred years,

"and at that moment,

632
00:36:33,263 --> 00:36:35,131
it can be
shattered."

633
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:37,133
And if it is?

634
00:36:38,669 --> 00:36:39,669
Then the balance

635
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,204
between
good and evil

636
00:36:41,205 --> 00:36:44,640
will shift,
and evil will rule.

637
00:36:47,077 --> 00:36:49,812
However, our friend
Mr. Van Helsing

638
00:36:49,813 --> 00:36:54,751

those forces himself.

657
00:37:48,272 --> 00:37:49,806
Interesting.

Tomorrow night.

662

Thank you very much.
Thanks.

Bye. Thank you
very much
for all your time.

664
00:38:13,964 --> 00:38:15,932
Thank you.
I expect
you boys thought

665
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:19,068
I was some kind
of monster myself?
Hmm?

666
00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:20,937
A vampire, perhaps?

667
00:38:20,938 --> 00:38:22,939
That's quite
all right.

668
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,841
But I am not,
you know.

669
00:38:24,842 --> 00:38:26,743
If I were
a vampire,

670
00:38:26,744 --> 00:38:29,245
then I wouldn't have
a reflection.

671
00:38:32,683 --> 00:38:33,750
Now, would I?

672
00:38:35,352 --> 00:38:38,488
Man, you sure know
a lot about monsters.

673
00:38:38,489 --> 00:38:41,858
Now that
you mention it...

674
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:43,760
I suppose I do.

675

[Fat Kid]
Guys, wait up!

676
00:38:53,203 --> 00:38:55,538
Tomorrow night?
What do we have to
do again?

677
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:56,806
Blow a hole
in Dumbo?

678
00:38:56,807 --> 00:38:58,041
Limbo, stupid.

679
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:59,275
So, how do
we know

680
00:38:59,276 --> 00:39:00,977
the amulet's
there, anyway?

681
00:39:00,978 --> 00:39:04,080
Because, you dweeb,
Dracula's obviously
here looking for it.

682
00:39:04,081 --> 00:39:07,383
If we don't find it
before he does,
we're beast bait.

683
00:39:07,384 --> 00:39:08,818
Okay, so,
say we get
the amulet.

684
00:39:08,819 --> 00:39:09,886
Then what?

685
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:11,387
Wait till
midnight...and?

686
00:39:11,388 --> 00:39:12,388
We get
a virgin.

687
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:13,723
A virgin?
Yeah.

688
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:16,225
Okay, right.
Then what?

689
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:18,461
Well, our virgin
takes the amulet,

690
00:39:18,462 --> 00:39:20,063
reads the magic spell
from the book,

691
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:22,899
and, blamo, we blow
a hole in Limbo.

692
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,067
That's so easy.

693
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:25,802
Oh, a cinch.
Piece of cake.
Yeah.

694
00:39:29,907 --> 00:39:31,574
Rudy. Question.

695
00:39:31,575 --> 00:39:32,575
Shoot.

696
00:39:32,576 --> 00:39:33,309
Know any virgins?

697
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,880
[Sean]
Okay. Rudy, find
some silver bullets.

698
00:39:37,881 --> 00:39:40,149
And where the hell
am I supposed to find
silver bullets?

I don't know.
Gimme a break.

Find Shadowbrook
Road.

What, do I look
in the index for
"big, scary mansion"?

702
00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:48,024
Oh, you're a riot.

You guys!

704
00:39:52,529 --> 00:39:54,564
How can we trust
Scary German Guy?

705
00:39:54,565 --> 00:39:56,699
Why would he lie
about a thing
like this?

706
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,934
Sean!

707
00:39:57,935 --> 00:39:59,068

Okay?

717

Come on.
I want to show you

00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:04,233
Oh, go for it.

D-Dead?

725
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:20,683
Does Mom know
about him?

726
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:22,285
No. Only us.

Hey, guys,

He's great!

Uhh!

to leave, okay?

You're not still
scared, are you?

get an adult.

00:42:01,058 --> 00:42:03,459
And your dad's a cop,
so if we get your dad--

[Sean]
Absolutely no
grown-ups. Okay?

745
00:42:06,063 --> 00:42:07,730
They'll lock him up
in a cage or something.

746
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:08,731
Dissect him.
