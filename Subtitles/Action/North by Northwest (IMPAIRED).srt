1
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,581
Even if you accept the belief that the
high Trendex means a rising sales curve...

2
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:22,040
- Mr. Thornhill.
- Good night.

3
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,668
- Say hello to the missus.
- We're not talking.

4
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:26,545
My recommendation is still the same.

5
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,756
Spread the good word
in as many small-time segments as we can.

6
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:33,886
Let the opposition have their high ratings
while we cry all the way to the bank.

7
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,221
Why don't we colonize
at the Colony next week?

8
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,016
Let me hear from you, Sam.
Uh, happy thoughts, et cetera.

9
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:40,642
You better walk me to the Plaza.

10
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,729
MAGGIE: I didn't put a coat on.
- Use your blood sugar, child. Come on.

11
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,647
- Next?
- Gretchen Sabinson.

12
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:49,151
Oh, yes. Send her a box of candy
from Blum's, $10. You know the kind.

13
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,653
Each piece wrapped in gold paper.
She'll like that.

14
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:53,280
She'll think she's eating money.

15
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:56,116
Just say to her:
"Darling, I count the days, the hours..."

16
00:02:56,284 --> 00:02:58,160
- You sent that one last time.
- I did?

17
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:02,372
Well, put: "Something for your sweet tooth,
baby, and all your other sweet parts."

18
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,625
- I know.
- Could we take a cab, Mr. Thornhill?

19
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:06,835
- For two blocks?
- You're late and I'm tired.

20
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,546
That's your trouble, Maggie,
you don't eat properly.

21
00:03:09,714 --> 00:03:11,173
Here. Taxi.

22
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,301
I have a very sick woman here.
You don't mind, do you?

23
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:15,928
- Well, no.
ROGER: Thank you very much.

24
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,137
Perfectly all right.

25
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:21,183
- First stop, the Plaza. Don't throw the flag.
- Poor man.

26
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:23,435
Oh, come, come, come.
I made him a happy man.

27
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,814
- I made him feel like a good Samaritan.
- He knew you were lying.

28
00:03:27,982 --> 00:03:31,151
Ah, in the world of advertising,
there's no such thing as a lie.

29
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,280
There's only the expedient exaggeration.
You ought to know that.

30
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:38,283
- Say, do I look heavyish to you?
- What?

31
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,868
I feel heavyish.

32
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:42,537
Put a note on my desk in the morning:
"Think thin."

33
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:44,498
"Think thin."

34
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:47,584
- Better make it the 59th Street entrance.
- Okay.

35
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:50,462
Oh. Soon as you get back,
call my mother.

36
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,173
Remind her we've got those theater tickets
for tonight.

37
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,092
Dinner at 21, 7:00.

38
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,179
I'll have had two martinis at the Oak Bar,
so she needn't bother to sniff my breath.

39
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:02,182
- She doesn't do that.
- Sure she does. Like a bloodhound.

40
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,852
Bigelow at 10:30 is your first tomorrow,
the Skin Glow rehearsal at noon...

41
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,021
...then lunch with Falcon and his wife.

42
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,482
- Oh, yeah. Where was that?
- Larry and Arnold's, 1:00.

43
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,609
- Oh.
- Will you check in later?

44
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:13,819
Absolutely not.

45
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,739
Here, driver, take this lady
back where she belongs.

46
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:19,908
- Right.
- That ought to cover it.

47
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:23,161
- Don't forget, call my mother right away.
- I won't.

48
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,206
- Good night, Mr. Thornhill.
- Good night, sweetie.

49
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:32,045
Oh, wait, Maggie. You can't call her.
She's at Mrs...

50
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:55,402
- Good evening.
ROGER: Good evening.

51
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,988
I'm looking for Mr. Weltner
and two other gentlemen.

52
00:04:58,156 --> 00:04:59,906
Yes, sir. Right this way.

ROGER: Herman.
- Roger.

54
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,036
- I'm a little late.
- Roger Thornhill.

55
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,662
- Fanning Nelson.
- How do you do?

56
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,372
- How do you do?
- Larry Wade.

57
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,584
- We got a little head start here.
- Oh, that won't last long.

58
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:15,255
I was telling Larry and Fanning you may be
slow on starting but there's nobody faster.

59
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:18,842
- What's the matter? You've got the fidgets.
- I just did something stupid.

60
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,596
I told my secretary to call Mother.
I realized she won't be able to reach her.

61
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:25,724
HERMAN: Why not?
- She's playing bridge at one of her cronies'.

62
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,310
- Your secretary?
- No. My mother.

One of those new apartments.
Wet paint and no telephone yet.

MAN: George Kaplan.
- Perhaps if I send her a telegram.

65
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:35,734
- Mr. George Kaplan?
ROGER: Boy.

66
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,326
- Kaplan.
- I've got to get off a wire immediately.

67
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:46,787
Could you send it for me
if I write it out for you?

68
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:49,456
Oh, I'm not permitted to do that, sir,
but if you'll follow me.

69
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:52,459
- Oh. Will you excuse me, gentlemen?
- Go right ahead.

70
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,839
- Right through there, sir.
- Yeah, thanks.

00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,674
Thank you, sir.

Wait, what's that supposed to be?

73
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:06,765
The car's waiting outside.
You will walk between us saying nothing.

74
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,101
- What are you talking about?
- Let's go.

75
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:12,312
Let's go where? Who...? Who are you?

76
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,564
Mere errand boys
carrying concealed weapons.

His is pointed at your heart. So, please,
no errors of judgment, I beg of you.

00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,654
What is this, a joke or something?

79
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:24,157
- Yes, a joke. We will laugh in the car.
- Come.

ROGER:
But this is ridiculous.

Don't tell me where we're going,

00:06:51,853 --> 00:06:54,521
You know, I left some friends back there
in the Oak Bar.

83
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,565
They're going to think I'm awfully rude.

84
00:06:56,732 --> 00:06:59,526
I mean, uh, couldn't we stop off
at a drugstore for a moment...

85
00:06:59,694 --> 00:07:03,947
...so that I could explain
I'm being, uh, kidnapped?

86
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:06,700
Well, that is what's happening, isn't it?

Really?

91
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,230
Interesting.

92
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,193
- Where is he?
- Upstairs, dressing.

93
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,779
- Tell him I'm here.
- The dinner guests are expected.

94
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:27,989
Never mind that. Say to him: "Kaplan."

By the way,
what are we having for dessert?

- Is anyone in the library?
- No.

This way.

98
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:46,132
You will wait here.

Good evening.

102
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:59,581
Not what I expected. A little taller.

103
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,375
A little more polished than the others.

104
00:10:03,252 --> 00:10:06,212
Oh, I'm so glad you're pleased,
Mr. Townsend.

105
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,716
But I'm afraid just as obvious.

106
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,178
What the devil is all this about?
Why was I brought here?

107
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:17,891
Games? Must we?

108
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:20,894
Not that I mind a case of abduction...

109
00:10:21,062 --> 00:10:23,688
...but I have tickets
for the theater this evening.

110
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:28,401
To a show I was looking forward to. And I
get unreasonable about things like that.

111
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:32,530
With such expert play-acting,
you make this very room a theater.

112
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:37,160
Oh, Leonard,
have you met our distinguished guest?

113

He's a well-tailored one, isn't he?

114
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:44,584
My secretary is a great admirer
of your methods, Mr. Kaplan.

115
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:48,838
- Elusiveness, however misguided...
- Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

116
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:51,966
- Did you call me "Kaplan"?
- I know you're a man of many names...

...but I'm perfectly willing to accept
your current choice.

118
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:56,179
Current choice?

119

My name is Thornhill. Roger Thornhill.
It's never been anything else.

00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:01,351
Of course.

121

Your friends picked up the wrong package
when they bundled me out here in the car.

Do sit down, Mr. Kaplan.

Now, shall we get down to business?

I'm all for that.

129
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:26,459
Simply, I'd like you to tell me
how much you know of our arrangements...

130
00:11:26,627 --> 00:11:28,753
...and how you've come by
this information.

00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,464
- I don't expect to get this for nothing.
- Of course not.

Don't misunderstand, I don't expect you
to fall in with this suggestion...

133
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:39,764
...but the least I can do is afford you
the opportunity of surviving the evening.

What the devil is that supposed to mean?

Why don't you surprise me,
Mr. Kaplan, and say yes?

00:11:47,898 --> 00:11:50,734
ROGER: I've already told you...
- We know where you're headed for.

137
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:51,985
I know where I'm headed.

138

I'm headed for the Winter Garden Theater in
New York, and I think I'd better get going.

00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:07,125
Townsend,
you're making a serious mistake.

140
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:11,337
This is not going to lead
to a very happy conclusion, Mr. Kaplan.

141
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:14,507
ROGER: I'm not Kaplan.
- I do wish you'd reconsider.

00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:19,262

since Jason committed suicide.

What people?
The house is completely closed up.

Just the gardener and his wife
living on the grounds.

Now, Mr. Kaplan, suppose you tell me

...which he gave to an attendant in the
General Assembly Building was false.

503
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:53,271
A possible motive for the slaying
was suggested by the discovery...

504

...that earlier today, Thornhill appeared
at Glen Cove police court...

How can he get mistaken for
George Kaplan when he doesn't even exist?

Don't ask me how it happened.
Obviously, it happened.

515

No, my dear woman,

somewhere before.

Mm-hm.

611
00:47:39,715 --> 00:47:43,718
Funny how I have that effect on people.
It's something about my face.

612
00:47:43,886 --> 00:47:46,178
It's a nice face.

- You think so?
- I wouldn't say it if I didn't.

ROGER:
Honest.

Not really.

617
00:47:57,065 --> 00:48:00,818
- Good. Because honest women frighten me.
WOMAN: Why?

618
00:48:00,986 --> 00:48:03,821
I don't know. Somehow,
they seem to put me at a disadvantage.

619
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:07,241
- Because you're not honest with them?
ROGER: Exactly.

Like that business
about the seven parking tickets?

621

Well, what I mean is,
the moment I meet an attractive woman...

622

...I have to start pretending
I've no desire to make love to her.

What makes you think you have
to conceal it?

624
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:24,008
She might find the idea objectionable.

Then again, she might not.

Think how lucky I am
to have been seated here.

He didn't tell me anything.

No. I assumed Chicago.

01:38:46,111 --> 01:38:48,529
Come on. We'll discuss it on the plane.

1218

[SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]

1219
01:39:09,885 --> 01:39:14,138
Now, look. You started this decoy business
without me, you finish it without me.

1220
01:39:14,306 --> 01:39:16,391
We might have
if you hadn't stumbled into it.

1221
01:39:16,558 --> 01:39:20,228
You ought to give me a medal
instead of asking me to be a target...

1222
01:39:20,396 --> 01:39:23,398
...just so your special agent or whatever
doesn't get shot at.

1223
01:39:23,565 --> 01:39:28,611
Not shot at, Mr. Thornhill. Found out.
Once found out, they're as good as dead.

1224
01:39:28,779 --> 01:39:32,573
Thanks to you,
clouds of suspicion are already forming.

1225
01:39:32,741 --> 01:39:34,325
Thanks to me?

1226
01:39:34,493 --> 01:39:36,911
- If you'll get on the plane...
- You listen to me.

1227
01:39:37,079 --> 01:39:41,666
I'm an advertising man, not a red herring.
I've got a job, a secretary, a mother...

1228
01:39:41,834 --> 01:39:44,585
...two ex-wives and several bartenders
dependent upon me...

1229
01:39:44,753 --> 01:39:48,047
...and I don't intend to disappoint them all
by getting myself killed.

1230
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:50,466
The answer is no.

1231
01:39:50,634 --> 01:39:52,927
- Is that final?
- Yes.

1232
01:39:53,095 --> 01:39:55,179
- Goodbye, then.
- Goodbye.

1233
01:39:55,347 --> 01:39:58,850
If there was a chance of changing
your mind I'd talk about Miss Kendall.

1234
01:39:59,935 --> 01:40:01,769
Of whom you so obviously disapprove.

1235
01:40:01,937 --> 01:40:05,440
Yes, for using sex
like some people use a fly swatter.

1236
01:40:06,025 --> 01:40:07,942
I don't suppose it would matter to you...

1237
01:40:08,110 --> 01:40:12,113
...that she was probably forced to do
whatever she did to protect herself.

1238
01:40:12,281 --> 01:40:14,490
To protect herself from what?

1239
01:40:14,658 --> 01:40:17,535
Exposure and assassination.

1240
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:20,788
You see, Mr. Thornhill, she...

1241
01:40:21,457 --> 01:40:23,332
She's one of our agents.

1242
01:40:24,334 --> 01:40:26,836
- Oh, no.
- I know you didn't mean it...

1243
01:40:27,004 --> 01:40:31,591
...but I'm afraid you have put her
in an extremely dangerous situation.

1244
01:40:32,968 --> 01:40:35,344
And much more than her life is at stake.

1245
01:40:49,985 --> 01:40:53,237
- Suppose they don't come?
- They'll come.

1246
01:40:54,865 --> 01:40:58,159
ROGER: I don't like the way
Teddy Roosevelt is looking at me.

1247
01:40:58,327 --> 01:41:02,205
Perhaps he's trying to give you
one last word of caution, Mr. Kaplan.

1248
01:41:02,372 --> 01:41:04,415
Speak soft, and carry a big stick.

1249
01:41:04,833 --> 01:41:08,086
He's trying to tell me not to go through
with this harebrained scheme.

1250
01:41:08,253 --> 01:41:11,506
He doesn't know to what extent
you're the cause of our present trouble.

1251
01:41:12,007 --> 01:41:14,675
I don't know that I care
to accept that charge, professor.

1252
01:41:14,843 --> 01:41:18,262
Dear, fellow, if you hadn't made yourself
so attractive to Miss Kendall...

1253
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:20,890
...that she fell for you...
- And vice versa.

1254
01:41:21,058 --> 01:41:24,352
- Our friend Vandamm wouldn't
be losing faith in her loyalty now.

1255
01:41:24,895 --> 01:41:28,689
It was quite obvious to him last night
that she had become emotionally involved.

1256
01:41:28,857 --> 01:41:33,111
Worst of all, with a man he thinks
is a government agent.

1257
01:41:33,570 --> 01:41:35,780
Are you trying to tell me
that I'm irresistible?

1258
01:41:35,948 --> 01:41:39,450
I'm trying to remind you it is your
responsibility to help us restore her...

1259
01:41:39,618 --> 01:41:41,035
...to Vandamm's good graces...

1260
01:41:41,203 --> 01:41:44,205
...right up to the point
he leaves the country tonight.

1261
01:41:44,373 --> 01:41:45,706
All right, all right.

1262
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:47,875
But, after tonight...

1263
01:41:48,877 --> 01:41:50,878
My blessings on you both.

1264
01:42:05,394 --> 01:42:07,019
Here they are.

1265
01:43:00,532 --> 01:43:03,534
- Good afternoon, Mr. Kaplan.
- Not her.

1266
01:43:12,669 --> 01:43:15,421
Did I misunderstand you
about bringing her here?

1267
01:43:15,589 --> 01:43:17,798
We'll get to that later.

1268
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:20,593
I suppose you were surprised
to get my call.

1269
01:43:20,761 --> 01:43:24,597
Not at all. I knew the police
would release you, Mr. Kaplan.

1270
01:43:24,765 --> 01:43:27,642
By the way, I want to compliment you
on your colorful exit...

1271
01:43:27,809 --> 01:43:29,977
...from the auction gallery.

1272
01:43:30,145 --> 01:43:31,312
Thank you.

1273
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:34,440
And now, what little drama
are we here for today?

1274
01:43:34,608 --> 01:43:38,361
I don't for a moment believe that you've
invited me to these gay surroundings...

1275
01:43:38,528 --> 01:43:40,905
...to come to a business arrangement.

1276
01:43:42,491 --> 01:43:46,702
Suppose I tell you I not only know the exact
time you're leaving the country tonight...

1277
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:49,413
...but the latitude and longitude
of your rendezvous...

1278
01:43:49,581 --> 01:43:51,832
...and your ultimate destination.

1279
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,669
You wouldn't care to carry my bags for me,
would you?

1280
01:43:54,836 --> 01:43:58,089
Perhaps you'd be interested in the price,
just the same.

1281
01:43:58,257 --> 01:44:01,842
- The price?
- For doing nothing to stop you.

1282
01:44:03,053 --> 01:44:05,346
How much did you have in mind?

1283
01:44:06,014 --> 01:44:07,765
I want the girl.

1284
01:44:10,060 --> 01:44:12,937
I want the girl to get
what's coming to her.

1285
01:44:13,105 --> 01:44:16,482
Turn her over to me, I'll see there's
enough pinned on her to keep her...

1286
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:19,360
...uncomfortable for the rest of her life.

1287
01:44:20,195 --> 01:44:23,072
You do that,
and I'll look the other way tonight.

1288
01:44:23,615 --> 01:44:25,616
She really did get under your skin.

1289
01:44:25,784 --> 01:44:28,619
We're not talking about my skin.
We're talking about yours.

1290
01:44:28,787 --> 01:44:32,790
- I'm offering you a chance to save it.
VANDAMM: To exchange it.

1291

Put it any way you like.

1292
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:37,712
I'm curious, Mr. Kaplan.

1293
01:44:37,879 --> 01:44:41,299
What made you arrive at the deduction that
my feelings for Miss Kendall...

1294
01:44:41,466 --> 01:44:46,804
...have deteriorated to the point where
I would trade her in for peace of mind?

1295
01:44:46,972 --> 01:44:50,057
I don't deduce. I observe.

I'm going back to the house now.

Just a second, you.

Stay away from me. Let go.
Let go of me.

Stay away from me. Let go.

01:45:15,667 --> 01:45:17,335
Let go of me.

1301

- Now, save the phony tears.
- You just get back.

1302
01:45:22,799 --> 01:45:26,010
- You little fool.
- You just stay away from me.

Mr. Thornhill?

01:46:42,838 --> 01:46:44,338
Don't be long.

Hello.

Yes, I think so.

I asked the professor
if I could see you again.

1314
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:04,066
There's not much time.

Isn’t there?

I mean, apologize.

No need.

I understand.

All in the line of duty.

I hated you for it.

I didn't want you to go on
thinking that I...

1325
01:47:32,971 --> 01:47:36,724
And I... I used some pretty harsh words.
I'm sorry.

1326
01:47:36,892 --> 01:47:38,726
They hurt deeply.

1327

- Well, naturally, if I'd known...
- I couldn't tell you.

- Of course not.
- Could I?

No, I guess not.

1330
01:47:49,404 --> 01:47:52,531
EVE: You didn't get hurt. I'm so relieved.
- Of course I was hurt.

1331
01:47:52,699 --> 01:47:55,409
- How would you have felt?
- In the cafeteria, when you fell.

- When I shot you with the blanks.
- Oh, that. No.

1333

EVE: You did it rather well, I thought.
- Yes, I thought I was quite graceful.

Considering
it's not really your kind of work.

Well, I got into it by accident.
What's your excuse?

01:48:14,179 --> 01:48:18,641
I met Phillip Vandamm at a party one night
and saw only his charm.

Oh.

I guess I had nothing to do
that weekend, so I...

I decided to fall in love.

Well, that's nice.

Eventually, the professor and his
Washington colleagues approached me...

1342
01:48:35,992 --> 01:48:40,454
...with a few sordid details about Phillip
and he told me that...

1343
01:48:40,622 --> 01:48:44,583
...my relationship with him
made me uniquely valuable to them.

1344

Mm-hm.

So you became a Girl Scout, huh?

Maybe it was the first time anyone
ever asked me to do anything worthwhile.

How come?

Men like you.

What's wrong with men like me?

They don't believe in marriage.

See what I mean?

01:50:07,876 --> 01:50:11,920
It's much safer now, thanks to you,
my darling decoy.

1368
01:50:12,088 --> 01:50:14,340
Don't thank me. I couldn't stand it.

1369
01:50:14,507 --> 01:50:16,091
All right. I won't.

1370
01:50:16,259 --> 01:50:19,511
After your malevolent friend Vandamm
takes off tonight...

1371
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:23,849
...you and I are gonna get together and do a
lot of apologizing to each other in private.

1372
01:50:24,017 --> 01:50:27,311
- You know that can't be.
- Of course it can be.

1373
01:50:30,565 --> 01:50:32,733
He has told you, hasn't he?

1374
01:50:33,234 --> 01:50:36,278
- Told me what?
- Miss Kendall, you gotta get moving.

1375
01:50:36,446 --> 01:50:39,740
- Wait a minute. What didn't you tell me?
- Why didn't you?

1376
01:50:40,742 --> 01:50:43,911
She's going off with Vandamm tonight
on the plane.

1377
01:50:45,455 --> 01:50:47,081
She's going off with Vandamm?

1378
01:50:47,248 --> 01:50:50,250
We went to such lengths
to make her a fugitive from justice.

1379
01:50:50,418 --> 01:50:53,420
So that Vandamm couldn't very well decline
to take her along.

1380
01:50:53,588 --> 01:50:56,423
I needn't tell you how valuable
she can be to us over there.

1381
01:50:57,384 --> 01:50:59,426
You lied to me.
You said that after tonight...

1382
01:50:59,594 --> 01:51:02,304
- I needed your help.
- Well, you got it, all right.

1383
01:51:02,472 --> 01:51:03,597
Don't be angry.

1384
01:51:03,765 --> 01:51:06,016
You think I'm gonna let you
go through with this?

1385
01:51:06,184 --> 01:51:08,852
- Oh, she has to.
- Nobody has to do anything.

1386
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:11,105
I don't like the games
you play, professor.

1387
01:51:12,107 --> 01:51:15,067
War is hell, Mr. Thornhill,
even when it's a cold one.

1388
01:51:15,944 --> 01:51:18,362
If you can't lick the Vandamms
of this world...

1389
01:51:18,822 --> 01:51:21,740
...without asking girls to bed down
and fly away with them...

1390
01:51:21,908 --> 01:51:23,450
...and never come back...

1391
01:51:23,618 --> 01:51:26,286
...perhaps you ought to learn
how to lose a few cold wars.

1392
01:51:26,996 --> 01:51:29,498
I'm afraid we're already doing that.

1393
01:51:35,964 --> 01:51:40,259
- I'm not gonna let you do this. Get out.
- Please don't spoil everything. Please.

MAN [ON RADIO]: Mr. Kaplan twice in full
view of horrified men, women and children...

1395
01:51:49,602 --> 01:51:52,980
...who had come to the park to see
the famed Mount Rushmore monument.

1396
01:51:53,148 --> 01:51:58,652
Witnesses described Kaplan's assailant
as an attractive blonde in her late twenties.

1397
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:02,614
Kaplan, who was removed to the
Rapid City Hospital in critical condition...

1398
01:52:02,782 --> 01:52:06,785
...has been tentatively identified
as an employee of the federal government.

1399
01:52:06,953 --> 01:52:09,371
The tragedy developed
with startling suddenness.

1400
01:52:09,539 --> 01:52:12,750
Chris Swenson,
a busboy in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria...

1401
01:52:12,917 --> 01:52:15,919
...stated that he heard voices raised in...

1402
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:24,011
- Here we are.
- Hello.

1403
01:52:24,179 --> 01:52:26,847
Slacks, a shirt and these.

1404
01:52:27,015 --> 01:52:28,182
Thanks.

1405
01:52:28,349 --> 01:52:31,935
That'll do for you around here
for the next couple of days.

1406
01:52:32,687 --> 01:52:35,022
For the next couple of days?

1407
01:52:35,648 --> 01:52:36,690
- Hey.
- What?

1408
01:52:36,858 --> 01:52:37,941
What's this?

1409
01:52:38,109 --> 01:52:41,236
That's where I hit the chair
doing that phony fall in the cafeteria.

1410
01:52:41,404 --> 01:52:43,572
You and your dopey schemes, shootings.

1411
01:52:43,740 --> 01:52:47,534
- Otherwise, feeling all right?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

1412
01:52:47,702 --> 01:52:50,829
Considering your driver
has a sledgehammer for a hand.

1413
01:52:50,997 --> 01:52:52,873
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1414
01:52:53,041 --> 01:52:55,584
No, that's all right. I guess I deserved it.

1415
01:52:56,377 --> 01:52:58,545
I guess I deserve that locked door too.

1416
01:52:58,713 --> 01:53:02,633
You seen wandering about in good health
could've proved fatal to Miss Kendall.

1417
01:53:03,551 --> 01:53:06,553
- I've begun to forget her already.
- Good.

1418
01:53:06,721 --> 01:53:09,223
- Better that way.
- Yeah, much.

1419
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:12,017
Inside of an hour, she'll be gone.

1420
01:53:14,562 --> 01:53:18,440
- How's everything out in Rapid City?
- Oh, everything's fine.

1421
01:53:18,608 --> 01:53:22,653
Mr. Kaplan's untimely shooting has now
acquired the authority of the printed word.

1422
01:53:22,821 --> 01:53:25,280
Everyone's been cooperating beautifully.

1423
01:53:25,448 --> 01:53:27,032
Well, now you can include me.

1424
01:53:27,742 --> 01:53:29,910
- I'm a cooperator.
- I'm most grateful.

1425
01:53:30,411 --> 01:53:33,497
- Care to do me a favor in return?
- Anything.

1426
01:53:33,665 --> 01:53:36,792
I'd like a drink. Will you get me a...?
Get me some bourbon?

1427
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:38,502
A pint will do.

1428
01:53:39,003 --> 01:53:40,087
Can I join you?

1429
01:53:40,255 --> 01:53:43,382
Well, if you're gonna join me,
you better make it a quart.

1430
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:46,385
- See you in a few minutes.
- Yeah.

1431
01:54:50,491 --> 01:54:53,243
- Stop.
- Oh, excuse me.

1432
01:54:53,411 --> 01:54:55,162
Stop.

Oh, thanks.

VANDAMM: There's nothing to worry about.
EVE: I just lost my head.

1437

VANDAMM: I'm not just saying this
to make you feel better.

1438
01:58:14,779 --> 01:58:16,154
I mean it.

VANDAMM: He wanted to destroy you.
You had to protect yourself.

1441
01:58:21,202 --> 01:58:23,703
EVE: But not endanger you.
VANDAMM: Ah, rubbish.

1442
01:58:24,372 --> 01:58:28,542
Soon we'll be off together and I shall
dedicate myself to your happiness.

1443
01:58:30,044 --> 01:58:31,878
What's the situation, Leonard?

1444
01:58:32,046 --> 01:58:34,256
- About the plane, you mean?
- Of course.

What was the last report?

Over Whitestone on the hour,
6000, descending.

1447
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:42,389
VANDAMM: About ten minutes, huh?
LEONARD: At the most.

1448
01:58:42,557 --> 01:58:44,474
And now, uh...

1449
01:58:44,642 --> 01:58:47,561
I wonder if I might have a few words
of parting with you, sir?

1450
01:58:47,728 --> 01:58:49,354
Certainly.

1451
01:58:49,730 --> 01:58:51,439
In private?

1452
01:58:52,483 --> 01:58:54,401
I'll go up and get my things.

1453

VANDAMM:
Well, Leonard...

1454
01:58:56,445 --> 01:59:00,282
...how does one say goodbye
to one's right arm?

1455
01:59:06,747 --> 01:59:09,374
I'm afraid you're gonna wish
you had cut it off sooner.

Mm-hm.

LEONARD: I know how terribly fond you are
of Miss Kendall...

1458
01:59:16,549 --> 01:59:19,467
I don't find this a terribly attractive...

1459
01:59:22,847 --> 01:59:26,057
- She is not to be trusted.
- You're being mysterious.

1460
01:59:26,225 --> 01:59:28,560
I'm not being mysterious at all.

1461
02:00:01,677 --> 02:00:03,678
It couldn't have been anything.

1462
02:00:07,058 --> 02:00:09,809
You must've had some doubts
about her yourself.

1463
02:00:11,312 --> 02:00:13,980
- And still do.
VANDAMM: Rubbish.

1464
02:00:14,398 --> 02:00:16,983
LEONARD: Why else would
you have decided not to tell her...

1465
02:00:17,151 --> 02:00:19,945
...that our little treasure here
has a bellyful of microfilm?

You seem to be trying to fill mine
with rotten apples.

does taste like worms.

The truth? I've heard nothing
but innuendoes.

1469

Call it my woman's intuition if you will,
but I've never trusted neatness.

Neatness is always the result
of deliberate planning.

She shot him in a moment
of fear and anger.

- You were there yourself. You saw it.
LEONARD: Yes.

And thereby wrapped everything up
into one very neat and tidy bundle.

A, she removed any doubts
you may have had about her, uh...

Now, what did you call it, her devotion?

1476
02:00:54,021 --> 02:00:58,275
B, she gave herself a new and urgent reason
to be taken to the other side with you...

I found it in her luggage.

to show that you're not one of them.

Well, we better get moving.

1517
02:05:40,140 --> 02:05:43,643
He should have his wheels on the ground
inside of three minutes.

EVE: All right.

1519
02:05:51,819 --> 02:05:55,488
I think I left my earrings upstairs.
I'll be right down.

We can get out through the window.
There's a car.

You'll ruin everything.

They're going to do away with you!

- Leonard found the gun in your luggage.

1524
02:06:19,513 --> 02:06:22,557
The figure they got at the auction
is filled with microfilm.

- That's how he's been getting it.

leave the house until we're...

I'll wait, sir. I certainly will. Safe journey.

02:08:44,324 --> 02:08:45,992
I was wondering about my earrings.

VANDAMM:
They'll turn up.

1542
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:54,917
When you return to New York,
say goodbye to my sister for me.

1543
02:08:55,085 --> 02:08:57,754
And thank her for her superb performance
as Mrs. Townsend.

VANDAMM: Tell your knife-throwing chum...

02:09:00,591 --> 02:09:01,841
...that I've reassured his wife.

it was that same silly gun of yours.

- I see you've got the pumpkin.
- Yes.

1552
02:10:14,164 --> 02:10:16,916
This is no good.
We're on top of the monument.

We can't.

It's a proposal, sweetie.

What happened
to the first two marriages?

1562

My wives divorced me.

- Well, I think they said I led too dull a life.
