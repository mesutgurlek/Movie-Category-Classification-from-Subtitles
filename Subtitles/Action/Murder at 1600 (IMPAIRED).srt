00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,888
You see that jagged edge
on the wound there?

169
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,723
It's not big enough
to be scissors,

170
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:24,891
so I figure it must be
something smaller.

171
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:28,194
Excuse me. All film
stays in house.

172
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,696
Orders.

173
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,699
Whose orders,
tepper?

174
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,574
Anyone know what she
was doing here so late?

175
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,977
You're not cleared.

176
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,246
Who invited you here
anyway?

177
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,849
We did.

178
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,483
Sir,
he's not cleared.

179
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,719
He's
a D.C. homicide cop.

180
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,921
Well, if I'm not mistaken,
Mr. spikings,

181
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:56,956
what I see over there
is a homicide.

182
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,124
Spikings:
But jurisdiction...

183
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,558
jurisdiction
can go to hell.

184
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,960
With all due respect,

185
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,862
I'm in charge
of white house security.

186
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:06,733
With all due respect, I'm the
president's national security adviser.

187
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:09,335
A woman murdered
in the white house

188
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,270
40 yards from where
the president sleeps

189
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,173
is a matter
of national security.

190
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,408
Alvin Jordan.

191
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,810
Yes. Harlan Regis,
homicide.

192
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,612
Sir, do you happen
to know what she was doing

193
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,248
working here so late
on a Friday night?

194
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,251
Well, the government doesn't shut
down just because it's Friday.

195
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:28,087
Ah, yes. I understand.

196
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,725
Oh, and do you know how many
people were in the white house?

197
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,495
31.

198
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,230
31?

199
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,231
Yeah.

200
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,232
Yeah.

201
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,834
Carry on, detective.

202
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,070
Thank you, sir.

203
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:46,973
We'd like you to avoid
using 2 words

204
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,841
if you give any statements
to the media.

205
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:50,743
The words
are woman and murder.

206
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,645
You say all information
will be forthcoming

207
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,715
on an appropriate
and timely basis.

208
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,684
Mr. spikings...

209
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,119
One more thing.

210
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,553
I'm gonna need
everything you have

211
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,755
on what she was
working on...

212
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,223
you'll get
what's material.

213
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,959
Well, this is D.C., and,
unfortunately, she's mine.

214
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,194
She was murdered
in the white house,

215
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,595
not in some alley
out in southeast.

216
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:10,596
She was killed
in my city.

217
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,133
She was killed
in my house.

218
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,836
Don't you ever forget that.

219
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,473
He's all yours.

220
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,413
Hey, I'm just trying
to do my job.

221
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,649
Oh,
I guess I'm supposed

222
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,019
to get my briefings
from CNN, right?

223
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,021
No, you get it from
your secret service liaison

224
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,622
for the task force.

225
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,457
Well, he didn't
assign me one.

226
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:40,493
Yes, he did.
Nina chance.

227
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,533
I see. They think
I'm boo boo the fool.

228
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:48,935
Excuse me?

229
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:51,170
So I guess he figures that
I'll be easier on you

230
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,139
than I would some rookie
with acne, right?

231
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,741
Detective,
I'm an on-line agent

232
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,910
for the United States
secret service,

233
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,245
which means,
among other things,

234
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,647
that I'm fully qualified
to answer any questions

235
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:03,282
relating to white house
security.

236
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,483
Furthermore, I resent
the implication...

237
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:07,153
furthermore, you resent
the implication?

238
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:08,487
Man.

239
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,424
People don't even speak
English in this town anymore.

240
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,662
[Sighs]

241
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,231
Detective,
it's this way.

242
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,666
I know that.

243
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:21,901
There's been
no statement yet

244
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:24,103
about what's happening
in the white house.

245
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,072
We've been told only
that the first family

246
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,007
is at camp David
for the weekend.

247
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,708
As you can see behind me,

248
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:32,278
the immediate area
has been sealed off.

249
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,048
Sheldon turcott,
CNN, at the white house.

250
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:41,120
Why kill someone from
the office of protocol?

251
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,789
Maybe she sat some ambassador
in the wrong seat.

252
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,591
Oh, they kill you
for that now?

253
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:46,692
Tough town.

254
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:47,860
If I would have known,

255
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:49,161
I would have put
a turnstile in here

256
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,997
and charged admission
or something.

257
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:51,998
Who else was here?

258
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,065
Um, secret service.

259
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,500
They started
around 11:15.

260
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,136
And can you believe they
even took her garbage?

261
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,570
Anyway,
if you guys want me,

262
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,571
I'll be downstairs,
101.

263
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,806
Thank you
very much.

264
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,009
Anytime.

265
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,757
Wait a minute.

266
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,392
The body's found at 11:00,

267
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,130
and the feds arrive here
15 minutes later.

268
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,065
How do they do that?

269
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:30,002
Yeah. They don't even have
cool sirens like we do.

270
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,039
Look at her photo album.

271
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,474
Look at this, Regis.

272
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,743
Is this the only one?

273
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,811
It's the only one
I see,

274
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,280
but, you know,
I just got here.

275
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,882
I can tell you that the
apartment is registered

276
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,884
in the name of,
uh...

277
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,553
Brookland
associates,

278
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,523
but that is about all
I have right now.

279
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,070
Psst.

280
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:13,079
Wow. 1.2 on the beach.

281
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,480
White house giving out

282
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:17,683
some pretty sweet Christmas
bonuses this year.

283
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:19,486
Yeah,
looks that way.

284
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,557
I want a complete list of
everybody in-house last night

285
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:26,959
between 9:00 and 11:00,

286
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,396
and don't tell me
that is classified.

287
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:37,270
Quick on the draw,
huh, agent chance?

288
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,376
There's only 30 names here.

289
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,345
All whereabouts
accounted for.

290
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,516
Spikings told me
that there were 31.

291
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,621
I mean,
I see his name here.

292
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,457
So whose name
is missing?

293
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,762
Well, apparently, agent
spikings was mistaken.

294
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,665
The count is 30
in-house.

295
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,706
Better check it out.

296
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,708
I'm on it.

297
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,850
So, agent chance,
where you from?

298
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,586
Iowa.

299
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,121
Iowa, huh?

300
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,123
So why
the secret service?

301
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,991
I mean, why not...

302
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,360
Why not
kindergarten teacher?

303
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,195
No, you don't look like
one of those at all.

304
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,596
I was in the Olympics.

305
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,465
The Olympics?

306
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,967
That's how I got
in the secret service.

307
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,369
Is that right?

308
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,570
I was on
the sharpshooting team.

309
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,273
I met president Reagan.
It was in 1988.

310
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:50,042
One of his agents
was a woman.

311
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,278
She sort of took me
under her wing.

312
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,248
Mmm. Sharpshooting. Ha.

313
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,649
I feel safe already.

314
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,188
I brought home the gold.

315
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,491
Wow.

316
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,929
Chance: Where are we going?

317
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,466
Regis: To my place.
I gotta change.

318
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,304
You're being evicted?

319
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,471
The whole damn building.

320
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,739
The feds
are tearing it down

321
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,909
to put up a parking
garage for the, uh...

322
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,245
For the, uh...

323
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,846
Interstate commerce
commission.

324
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:29,248
Yeah.

325
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,016
What do they need a parking
lot around here for?

326
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,785
Hell if I know. I've been
trying to figure that out.

327
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,356
Whole building thinks that I
can fix it because I'm a cop.

328

00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,093
Mrs. Wallace.

330
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:42,628
Look, in less than a month,

out on garbage cans.

332

I'm making progress,
Mrs. Wallace.

333
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,699
Truly I am.
Progress?

334
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,435
Is that what you call it?

335
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:50,469
Progress.

336
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,671
I should say you are
making some progress.

337
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,241
You better take care of your business, boy.
You know that?

338
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,775
That's what you
should be doing

339
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,010

Making progress.

All right, make
yourself comfortable.

Washington city,
July 21, 1861.

343
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:27,306
And this is manassas,
first battle of bull run.

344
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,376
Come here. I want
to show you something.

345
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:35,481
Right here, that's where stonewall
Jackson got his nickname.

346
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,184
That's sutley Springs there.

347
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,386
Civilians used to come
on that crest over there

348
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:43,054
and take carriages and
picnics to watch the battle.

You did this
all by yourself?

Mm-hmm.

My father was
a history buff,

358
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,844
so I guess it kind
of rubbed off on me.

00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,279
And what did he do?

360
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,782
He worked at the Smithsonian

I mean, first, I gotta
take it all apart,

365
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,395
and then I gotta put it
all back together again.

366
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:25,597
Oh, no. Hell, no.

367
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:26,998

her credit card,

her bank account all impounded
and now classified.

387
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,274
She had a shuttle flight
to New York,

The evidence indicates
a crime of passion.

There's clear evidence
of vaginal penetration.

There's traces of lubricant
in the vaginal tract

and under the fingernails.

The blows were from the left
and powerful.

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,382
A condom was used.

401

00:53:38,749 --> 00:53:40,784
We're being patient.

823
00:53:40,785 --> 00:53:42,452
And prudent.

824
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:43,987
Mr. president...

825
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:45,822
I feel duty-bound
to tell you

826
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:48,693
that your lack of action here
borders on the criminal.

827
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:54,231
Then you've done
your duty, general.

828
00:53:57,768 --> 00:54:01,438
Now I'll do mine.

829
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:05,942
I expect your resignation
on my desk in the morning.

830
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:08,579
You shall have it.

831
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:13,016
That's all, gentlemen.

832
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:15,953
Alvin?

833
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,382
What's the matter?

834
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:47,718
[Paper rustling]
Here.

835
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:54,558
This is Carla's tape from
my answering machine.

836
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,461
Well, how'd you get it?
That's right.

837
00:54:58,729 --> 00:54:59,929
I stole it.

838
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,632
Look...

839
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:03,900
Here's what you need.

840
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:06,570
In her appointment book,

841
00:55:06,571 --> 00:55:08,204
she has
a meeting in there

842
00:55:08,205 --> 00:55:10,375
scheduled for tomorrow
in New York.

843
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:16,413
Craig nisker
and associates?

844
00:55:16,414 --> 00:55:18,014
He's the king of tell-all.

845
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:23,019
His agency sold 5 of the top 10
scandal memoirs of all time.

846
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,455
That's his motive.

847
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:28,692
I'll be damned.

848
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:31,361
Jack, Kyle,

The oval office
threesome.

850
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:35,599
Figure she was going
to burn the whole family.

851
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,201
She was going
to score big with this.

852
00:55:38,202 --> 00:55:40,770
I guess Kyle
found out about it.

853
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:43,139
We can place him at
the scene of the crime,

854
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,341
and we know that he had a history
of violence against women.

855
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,810
[Tires screeching]

856
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:47,912
That's it.

00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:50,880
Oh, he's mine.

858
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:53,850
Well, you just don't
get it, do you?

859
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,954
These people can
make us disappear.

860
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:01,925
I've got to get
out of here.

861
00:56:01,926 --> 00:56:04,193
Where are you going?

862
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,996
I checked into a motel.

863
00:56:06,997 --> 00:56:08,064
I'll call you.

864
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:09,834
Be careful.

865
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:20,276
The court
may direct what?

866
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:22,345
Mr. Peterson?

867
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:25,949
Uh, under 21.98
of the criminal code,

868
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:29,886
the court may allocate a fine
for the children of the victim.

869
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,555
Please,
Mr. Peterson, please.

870
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:33,557
What is it,
the porch light's on,

871
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:35,258
but nobody's home,
is that it?

872
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:37,093
Peterson:
Or the victim's spouse.

873
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:39,463
Incorrect, Mr. Peterson.

874
00:56:39,464 --> 00:56:42,899
The court may direct that the
amount of the fine when paid

875
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,302
be paid for the use of the
female seduced or her child

876
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:48,505
if she have any.

877
00:56:48,506 --> 00:56:50,306
Now, pursuant
to this statute,

878
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:54,911
we have Desmond vs.
Presley, which states...

879
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,647
Where testimony
in rape prosecution

880
00:56:57,648 --> 00:57:00,484
concerning clothing of
defendant was technically...

881
00:57:00,485 --> 00:57:01,618
what is it, Mr. Neil?

882
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:04,353
[Laughter]
Heavy date?

883
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:06,691
That's... that's
pretty funny.

884
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,286
Hey.

885
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,623
You look good.

00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:48,297
What's going on?

888
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,867
I just need your car,
all right?

889
00:58:24,468 --> 00:58:25,468
Hey!

890

Jesus Christ, man,
you are a son of a bitch.

I'm going to have your goddamn
badge, you know that?

894
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:34,343
Why didn't you just shoot
her if you had this, huh?

895
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,012
You know who I am? You know
who you're dealing with?

896
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,313
I don't give a shit
who you are.

897
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:39,482
You're going down.
Turn around.

Just like a big fish.

901
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,022
Fell right for the bait.

902
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,825
Or a man who wants to know
who's trying to frame him.

903
00:58:48,826 --> 00:58:50,126
You were with her
that night.

904
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,427
You had sex with her,
and then you offed her.

905
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:52,762
Oh, Jesus.

906
00:58:52,763 --> 00:58:54,163
You think
it was an accident

907
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:56,332
she was murdered an hour
after I slept with her?

908
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:58,835
Someone knew I'd be there
with her that night.

909
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:01,470
Yeah, maybe somebody with
a motive as good as yours.

910
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,706
What motive?

911
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:04,708
Did your father
have sex with Carla town?

912
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:07,043
I don't know my
father's sexual resume.

913
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,845
You knew that she was
leaving town, though.

914
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:10,513
Yeah, I read
the newspapers.

915
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:11,748
2 nights in New York,

916
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:13,182
a connecting ticket
to the Virgin Islands,

917
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:14,383
and a hertz rent-a-car.

918
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,685
So?

919
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:18,288
So, Carla town didn't
have a driver's license.

920
00:59:20,357 --> 00:59:22,258
You think
I killed Carla?

921
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:23,760
Yeah.

922
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:25,696
You think you
could prosecute me?

923
00:59:26,631 --> 00:59:29,066
Your arms don't reach
that high, detective.

924
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:32,637
Still don't understand
why you showed up.

925
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:35,939
I go to sleep
every night

926
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,007
thinking about a woman
with 8 stab wounds.

927
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:41,444
A woman that I slept
with an hour before.

928
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:43,147
You try that
as a sleeping pill.

929
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,819
Hey, you forgot
something.

north Korean hostage-taking

01:00:11,676 --> 01:00:13,810
as an issue of concern
for the white house,

932
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:16,512
the murder of Carla town
remains unsolved.

As the attention of Washington

934
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:20,549
turn to Kyle Neil,

935
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,552
and the president's approval
ratings continue to plummet,

936
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:24,954
we must ask...

937
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:27,456
Will Carla town be
Jack Neil's chappaquiddick?

938

At this hour, no one knows
where the trail will end.

939
01:00:29,994 --> 01:00:32,095
We do know
that for an administration

940
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:33,629
already knee-deep
in troubled waters

941
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:37,834
of a potentially international
confrontation in north Korea,

942
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:39,635
a serious domestic
concern of this nature

943
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:44,407
is especially dangerous to the
president's public image.

944

Who was where?

956
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:16,200
The president
and the first lady.

957
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,668
They weren't at camp David
when Carla was murdered.

958
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:21,037
They were in
the white house!

How do you know this?

That morning, I almost
shot their golden retriever.

961
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,611
They never go anywhere
without that dog.

962
01:02:28,846 --> 01:02:32,281
Tonight, I saw footage of them coming
back from camp David with the dog.

963
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:35,051
Their alibi
is complete bullshit.

964
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:36,786
So, that means they
took them to camp David

965
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:38,287
after the body
was discovered.

have smuggled them out.

968
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:46,429
How?

969
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,898
The tunnels underneath
the white house.

970
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:52,635
Now, hey, look, I built
this city, remember?

971
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:55,171
I just can't
believe this.

972
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:57,273
They covered it up,
and they got them out?

973
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,341
Why?

974
01:02:58,342 --> 01:03:00,076
Because then they'd
be considered suspects

975
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:02,012
just like
everybody else.

976
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,481
Why should they be,
though?

977
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:06,782
That's the question.

978
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,518
Nina: Because he's the president
of the United States.

979
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,920
Regis:
What does that mean?

980
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:12,355
That he doesn't
have a motive?

981
01:03:12,356 --> 01:03:14,557
He has a mistress about
to drop a tell-all.

982
01:03:14,558 --> 01:03:15,925
That's

01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:18,027
The wounds are
from the left.

984
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:19,863
President Neil
is right-handed.

985
01:03:19,864 --> 01:03:22,565
Yeah, I noticed that.

He writes
with his right hand,

987
01:03:24,869 --> 01:03:26,269
but he swings
a baseball bat

988
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,837
and a golf club
with his left.

Yeah, she's still there.

Now, do you want me
to finish this?

where we want them.

Thanks, Regis.
I appreciate it.

I can take care
of myself.

I want you to lay low until I

about Nina chance, huh?

pulled last night, detective.

Last night had nothing
to do with me.

01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:39,295
I was off-duty.

Why do I find that
difficult to believe?

I don't care
what you believe.

01:06:42,566 --> 01:06:44,767
I want to know why the

the night
of the murder,

and you
didn't tell me.

The president's
not to be involved.

1029
01:06:49,539 --> 01:06:52,041
The president is about to
become an official suspect.

Look, it's my duty
to question...

1033
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,147
you're not questioning
the president.

1034
01:06:58,148 --> 01:07:01,550
The presidency is an
institution, not a person.

1035
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:04,520
That institution will
be protected at all costs.

Why do you think we got them
out of there that night?

It's a little bit
off your turf.

Let me tell you
something.

1045
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:27,843
I've known Jack Neil
for 3 decades.

1046
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:29,545
I'm godfather
to his son.

1047
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,214
Your suspicions
are ludicrous.

1048
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:33,182
Luchessi's a stooge.

1049
01:07:33,183 --> 01:07:34,883
How?
Then prove it.

1050
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,486
Nobody can pinpoint the
actual time of death,

1051
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:39,622
and he can't prove his
whereabouts for an hour.

1052
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:43,793
There are 27 cameras covering the
hallways of the working white house.

1053
01:07:45,129 --> 01:07:48,931
You're telling me none of them
captured her walking down a hallway

1054
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:51,066
within 3 minutes
of her death?

1055
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:54,571
Or are you trying
to tell me?

1056
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,807
The tapes
are classified.

1057

Out of my reach.

in a sea of its own bullshit.

Those 13 men aren't risking
their lives over bullshit, pal.

1061
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:13,789
Well, this is not
about those 13 men.

1062
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:16,259
It's about a dead woman
in the white house.

1063

You know...

a man's longevity

1066
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:26,570
by the first thing he turns
to in the morning paper.

1067

thing about luchessi.

Nobody saw him until 11:02.

have a trash compactor

The loop on the top of this
"L" is smooth and continuous.

In the day planner,

1102

here, there's an obvious
pause in the writing.

Carla town wasn't killed to
protect the administration.

She was murdered
to destroy it.

What do you mean?

I'm saying that somebody dumped
the dead body in the white house

1129
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:29,572
so that the blood trail could
lead right to the first family.

Response time?

Well, officially
5-7 minutes.

But realistically 10 or 11.

By that time
we'll either be fired,

or we're going to be dead.

01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:36,637
It's in my back.

1465
01:39:36,638 --> 01:39:37,605
Agent?

1466
01:39:37,606 --> 01:39:39,506
Mr. president, Carla
town was killed

1467
01:39:39,507 --> 01:39:40,442
to destroy you.

1468
01:39:40,443 --> 01:39:42,309
To force your
resignation.

1469
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:44,311
Then Jordan had
spikings shot

1470
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:46,214
because
he saw the tape.

1471
01:40:01,129 --> 01:40:02,329
Arrest him.

1472
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:04,398
What?

1473
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:05,766
Not him.

1474
01:40:05,767 --> 01:40:07,269
Him.

1475
01:40:17,879 --> 01:40:19,280
My god, Alvin.

1476
01:40:19,281 --> 01:40:22,283
You really had her killed,
didn't you?

1477
01:40:22,284 --> 01:40:25,319
I think president Teddy
Roosevelt said it best.

1478
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:29,823
If I must choose between
righteousness and peace,

1479
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:33,128
I choose righteousness.

1480
01:40:35,097 --> 01:40:37,564
She was 25 years old.

1481
01:40:37,565 --> 01:40:39,032
She was a child.

1482
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:41,569
She was a casualty of war.

1483
01:40:45,107 --> 01:40:46,574
Mr. president.

1484
01:40:51,346 --> 01:40:53,481
Get him out of here.

1485
01:40:56,851 --> 01:40:59,053
Thank you, son.

1486
01:41:01,789 --> 01:41:03,325
Gun!

1487
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:15,602
Nina, just stay easy.

1488
01:41:15,603 --> 01:41:17,003
Stay easy.

1489
01:41:17,004 --> 01:41:19,873
Just stay easy.
I'm right here.

1490
01:41:19,874 --> 01:41:21,843
All right, hold on.

1491
01:41:25,547 --> 01:41:28,749
No, there's absolutely
no truth whatsoever

1492
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:30,151
to any of those rumors.

1493
01:41:30,152 --> 01:41:33,154
At no time was
president Neil planning

1494
01:41:33,155 --> 01:41:35,189
on resigning from office.

1495
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:37,057
Here's what we know so far.

1496
01:41:37,058 --> 01:41:40,327
The murderer of Carla town
is dead.

1497
01:41:40,328 --> 01:41:41,762
He was killed today

1498
01:41:41,763 --> 01:41:44,865
as he fired upon authorities
attempting to arrest him.

1499
01:41:44,866 --> 01:41:48,402
In that same gun battle,

1500
01:41:48,403 --> 01:41:51,672
national security advisor
Alvin Jordan

1501
01:41:51,673 --> 01:41:55,909
and senior secret service
agent Nicholas spikings

1502
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:57,512
were also killed.

1503
01:42:00,315 --> 01:42:03,317
Did the killer actually
penetrate the white house

1504
01:42:03,318 --> 01:42:05,719
with the objective
of killing miss town?

1505
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:06,987
In 180 years,

1506
01:42:06,988 --> 01:42:09,055
there has never been a
penetration of the white house.

1507
01:42:09,056 --> 01:42:12,293
President and Mrs. Neil will
have a statement for you later.

1508
01:42:12,294 --> 01:42:13,394
Thank you very much.

1509
01:42:13,395 --> 01:42:15,929
[Shouting questions]

1510
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:17,398
Call D.C. homicide.

1511
01:42:17,399 --> 01:42:19,300
Tell them the detective
we found in the tunnel

1512
01:42:19,301 --> 01:42:21,302
is on his way to
university hospital.

1513
01:42:21,303 --> 01:42:23,837
Paramedics say
he's going to be fine.

1514
01:42:23,838 --> 01:42:25,907
Neil: How is she?

1515
01:42:27,242 --> 01:42:28,876
She's stable.

1516
01:42:30,178 --> 01:42:31,846
You saved my life.

1517
01:42:33,548 --> 01:42:36,351
Thank you.

1518
01:42:38,786 --> 01:42:41,188
And detective,

1519
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:42,789
how can I ever repay you?

1520
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:44,391
Mmm, don't bother.

1521
01:42:44,392 --> 01:42:46,327
Just doing my job.

1522
01:42:46,328 --> 01:42:48,895
Well,
there is one thing.

1523
01:42:48,896 --> 01:42:50,531
Yes, detective?

1524
01:42:50,532 --> 01:42:53,200
Have you ever heard of the
interstate commerce commission?

1525
01:42:53,201 --> 01:42:54,601
Sure.

1526
01:42:54,602 --> 01:42:56,136
Secretary Randall's office
is right down the street.

1527
01:42:56,137 --> 01:42:57,538
Right down the street?

1528
01:42:57,539 --> 01:42:58,340
Yeah.

1529
01:42:58,341 --> 01:43:00,341
See? It's not
what you know,

1530
01:43:00,342 --> 01:43:01,942
it's who you know.

1531
01:43:01,943 --> 01:43:03,744
What are you doing
for dinner?

1532
01:43:03,745 --> 01:43:06,948
What... what... i mean,
I'm not trying to...
