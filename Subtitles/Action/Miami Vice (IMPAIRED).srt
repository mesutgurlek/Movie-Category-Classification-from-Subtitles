Do we run an undercover

a load for Yero
into this group?

'cause presumably you're both
too smart and too fast
to get jacked again.

It'll show up

321

How'd they test?

322
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,061
And who tested them?

323
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:05,897
TRUDY: Helene in NYPD.

324
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:08,162
And she worked through
your false identities,

325
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:11,605
and then she found your

Nicholas say you
run a tight group.

344

That's nice, 'cause we got
product that's got to move.

345
00:34:51,388 --> 00:34:52,685
Real tight.
We move as fast as FedEx.

346
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:53,950
Move to where?

347
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:56,049
To New York,
through South Florida.

348
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:58,151
Move when?
Right now.

349
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:00,491
That's kind of all of
an instant.

RICO: That means
only one thing, real fast.

351
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:04,463
So, the price, is it right?

352
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,570
Price is right.

353
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:11,739
But how I know if you
any good at this shit?

354
00:35:15,745 --> 00:35:16,939
What's that?

355
00:35:17,114 --> 00:35:20,572
Yeah, your business.
How much volume you do?

356
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,911
Whose product you move?
Who you work with?

357
00:35:22,986 --> 00:35:26,353
Other than Nicholas,
who the fuck knows you?

358
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,153
Well, my mommy
and daddy know me.

00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:36,023
And we don't talk about
who we work with.

360
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:37,930
And we didn't come down here
to audition for business.

361
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:39,901
Business auditions for us.

And knows all about us,
before they call Nicholas.

they gonna say?

373

They're gonna look around
and they're gonna go...

374

"That's some crazy

What is that?

"Jackson Pollock?"

(ISABELLA SPEAKING SPANISH)

381
00:37:18,034 --> 00:37:19,524
So let's talk equipment.

382
00:37:19,603 --> 00:37:23,004
Adam A500s, carbon composite,
real stealthy.

383
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:25,598
1,400 nautical-mile range,
low and slow.

384
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:28,644
We like Caravelles and 727 s
to move the product
from source countries

385
00:37:28,712 --> 00:37:30,339
to transshipment
places like here.

386
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:32,506
Big loads, we like containers.

387
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:35,608
Smaller loads
into South Florida,
we do go-fast boats.

388
00:37:36,186 --> 00:37:37,448
So, what's the weight?

389
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,420
First, let's talk logistics.
Okay.

390
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:43,482
You pick up a load,
you fly it in the hole,
we tell you the drop point,

391
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,187
and our people then
move it on up the road.

392
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:49,028
Now, not so fast. People
at the drop point are
our people, not yours.

393
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,499
You know,
so there's no tweakers,

394
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:53,832
dopers, first-timers,
people we don't know.

395
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:57,101
They didn't do time with us,
they ain't doing
crime with us.

396
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:59,573
Once we pick up the load,
the next time you hear from us

397
00:37:59,643 --> 00:38:01,372
it'll be a date, time,
and a place.

398
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:03,275
Like, "There's a 18-wheeler
in a parking lot

399
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:05,109
in north Miami with the keys
in the ignition."

400
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:08,912
You pick it up,
you drive away.
Smooth, that's how we do it.

401
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:13,549
So, when you
looking to move it?

402
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:17,389
Never.

403
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:21,222
'Cause how you drop loads,
I don't like,
so maybe this don't work.

404
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,027
Then it don't work.

Red light, green light, José.

406

They also call me <i>Cochi Loco.</i>

407
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,531
That means "crazy pig."

408
00:38:33,176 --> 00:38:36,236
'Cause I run security
and counterintel.

409
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:39,942
I get people to tell me
what they don't ever
want to say.

410
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:43,179
And I have eyes everywhere.

411
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:47,579
That part of what I do,
you never want to
find out about.

412
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:53,861
Other people negotiate money,
and go and no go.

413
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,763
Yes, no, maybe so.

414
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:00,466
Not me.

415
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:03,131
So, what the hell
are we talking to you for?

416
00:39:03,206 --> 00:39:04,901
I had to lay my eyes on you.

417
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:06,236
Why is that?

418
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:08,941

420
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:19,912
You seem okay.

421
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,456
But him,

422
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:27,062
I don't like how he looks.

423
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:33,633
Do you want to
fuck my partner, or do you
want to do business with us?

424
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,905
'Cause I don't give a shit
how you think he looks.

425
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:40,873
Wait by the phone
in the hotel.

426
00:39:42,379 --> 00:39:45,348
You get a call,
or maybe you don't.

427

And then you can piss off
back to where you come from.

428
00:40:44,674 --> 00:40:47,541
Yero said New York
through South Florida.

429
00:40:48,578 --> 00:40:51,172
Then this load
does not go
to the Miami group.

430
00:40:51,848 --> 00:40:54,112
That may take load number two.

Excuse me,
because I am very busy.

I have many things to do,
so this will be brief. Yes?

you must do

you will do.

In this business with me,
I do not buy a service.
I buy a result.

448

If you say
you will do a thing,

449

you must do
exactly that thing.

01:06:29,117 --> 01:06:31,779
Lucinda somebody's wedding.

627

Everybody is with couples.

Husbands and wives,

But she is the most special.

630
01:07:49,531 --> 01:07:52,056
Let's talk
a different kind of deal.

631
01:08:00,175 --> 01:08:01,836
You pay us zero.

632
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:07,041
Is it December?

633
01:08:07,282 --> 01:08:08,374
Why?

634
01:08:08,883 --> 01:08:11,215
Did Christmas
come early this year?

635
01:08:11,586 --> 01:08:12,712
No.

636
01:08:13,855 --> 01:08:16,847
We become partners
on the loads we run.

637
01:08:17,525 --> 01:08:20,653
What we want is
25% of that load in product.

would I be crazy enough
to cut in these <i>gringos</i>
like that?

640
01:08:29,337 --> 01:08:33,569
It's because Sonny and Ricardo
can deliver to me
what no one else can.

641
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:36,667
We guarantee loads.

642

Your operation will run
from now on out risk-free.

645
01:08:53,161 --> 01:08:54,321
You?

646
01:08:55,663 --> 01:09:00,191
What if I tell you
your ideas are too big
for your skin?

647
01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:05,238
And merely to propose this
is a dangerous thing.

648
01:09:07,175 --> 01:09:10,167
Then I would say to you,
this has been fun.

649
01:09:10,245 --> 01:09:11,940
Okay. So?

650
01:09:18,353 --> 01:09:20,617
Think of the cash
you don't have to front.

651
01:09:20,688 --> 01:09:23,248
Cash is not difficult.

Seventeen.

653
01:09:36,104 --> 01:09:39,699
I would say you're
five percentage points
away from a deal.

654
01:09:40,008 --> 01:09:42,340
Maybe I'm only one.

1091
01:57:04,282 --> 01:57:05,340
Stall.

1092
01:57:05,584 --> 01:57:06,915
Copy that.

1093
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:18,259
Where's the product?

1094
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:19,763
Where's the money?

1095
01:57:20,799 --> 01:57:23,097
How do I know
what you say is there,
is there?

1096
01:57:23,168 --> 01:57:24,829
Here's how that works,

1097
01:57:24,903 --> 01:57:27,269
somebody from my side
lays eyes on the money.

1098
01:57:27,339 --> 01:57:29,000
Only then do we
call in the dope.

1099
01:57:29,074 --> 01:57:31,872
Then somebody from your side
can go look at the product.

1100
01:57:31,943 --> 01:57:35,310
The money's right here,
so send somebody over.

1101
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:37,571
CASTILLO:
Can't find the shooter.

1102
01:57:46,658 --> 01:57:48,148
Where's Yero?

1103
01:57:48,927 --> 01:57:50,258
YERO: Right here!

1104
01:57:51,096 --> 01:57:54,998
And I brought your friend.
<i>Oye, 'mano,</i> she mine now.

1105
01:57:57,002 --> 01:57:58,697
Jesús gave her to me

1106
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:02,536
to ask questions
and find out
interesting things.

1107
01:58:05,143 --> 01:58:06,838
We a couple now.

1108
01:58:07,312 --> 01:58:12,079
After work, she and me go
catch a movie and grab a bite.

1109
01:58:16,121 --> 01:58:18,214
When I get tired,
I throw her away.

1110
01:58:18,290 --> 01:58:21,259
Her leg in one place,
her head someplace else.

1111
01:58:21,793 --> 01:58:23,784
You guys ever see that?

1112
01:58:27,566 --> 01:58:29,625
Anyway, she here now

1113
01:58:30,102 --> 01:58:32,161
to make sure
everything go right.

1114
01:58:40,679 --> 01:58:42,544
<i>CASTILLO: Still no shooter.</i>

1115
01:58:43,748 --> 01:58:46,774
My guy, show him the money.

1116
01:58:48,019 --> 01:58:49,350
I don't want him!

1117
01:58:49,988 --> 01:58:51,080
Why?

1118
01:58:51,623 --> 01:58:52,954
What difference
does it make, Sonny?

1119
01:58:53,024 --> 01:58:54,286
Listen to me, asshole,

1120
01:58:54,359 --> 01:58:56,452
I do not want that
motherfucker near me.

1121
01:58:56,528 --> 01:58:59,691
You wanna see your dope?
You send Isabella.

1122
01:59:01,933 --> 01:59:03,161
Or it travels.

1123
01:59:13,111 --> 01:59:14,476
Stay here, bitch.

1124
01:59:21,086 --> 01:59:22,417
Let her go.

1125
01:59:28,126 --> 01:59:29,616
Check the dope,

1126
01:59:30,428 --> 01:59:32,157
then come right back.

1127
02:00:01,993 --> 02:00:03,517
Got one.

1128
02:00:07,599 --> 02:00:10,295
On the container. Hold it.

1129
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:24,009
I got number two.

1130
02:00:24,082 --> 02:00:27,347
Port side, third deck,
middle of the superstructure.

1131
02:00:31,156 --> 02:00:32,316
Fire.

1132
02:00:38,897 --> 02:00:40,296
(GUNS FIRING)

1133
02:00:40,799 --> 02:00:42,426
(ALL CLAMORING)

1134
02:01:29,547 --> 02:01:30,946
Go!

1135
02:01:37,289 --> 02:01:39,052
Go!

1136
02:01:45,730 --> 02:01:47,061
Go!

1137
02:02:08,219 --> 02:02:09,618
GINA: Go!

1138
02:02:11,423 --> 02:02:14,517
Move it, man. Run, run, run!

1139
02:02:57,569 --> 02:02:59,799
Crockett. I'm on your right.

1140
02:04:14,579 --> 02:04:15,944
Who are you?

1141
02:04:24,756 --> 02:04:26,383
Who are you?

1142
02:05:03,928 --> 02:05:05,395
Get up.

1143
02:05:05,563 --> 02:05:07,292
Get up.

1144
02:05:33,057 --> 02:05:35,924
Get in. Get in!

1145
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:45,092
Zito?
Yeah, he's okay.

1146
02:06:25,877 --> 02:06:27,208
Fuck you.

1147
02:08:14,719 --> 02:08:17,279
What is this?
It's a house we use.

1148
02:08:38,209 --> 02:08:40,677
Gloria? Sonny.
Is Frank around?

1149
02:08:44,882 --> 02:08:47,214
All right. Just get him
to call me right back.

1150
02:09:26,524 --> 02:09:29,459
A man named Frank
is going to come in a boat.

1151
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:31,653
He will run you
into Cayo Sotavento.

1152
02:09:31,729 --> 02:09:34,823
And from there,
you can find your way
to Havana.

1153
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:38,493
And nobody will follow you.

1154
02:09:42,707 --> 02:09:44,174
Including me.

1155
02:09:58,823 --> 02:10:00,085
Remember,

1156
02:10:01,959 --> 02:10:03,119
I said

1157
02:10:04,929 --> 02:10:06,396
time is luck.

1158
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,092
Yeah.

1159
02:10:12,737 --> 02:10:14,204
Luck ran out.

1160
02:10:20,311 --> 02:10:22,336
This was too good to last.

1161
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:57,534
Nurse?
