Damn it.

00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,587
We were headed for Junction 21
like you ordered.

00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,454
-Robbie picked up the signals
-We're confirming the HR scans.

5
00:02:58,628 --> 00:03:01,563
-We weren't sure what to do.
-The readings don't make any sense.

6
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:04,996
-They read like Sentinels.
-But there's thousands of them.

7
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:08,160
-Directly above us.
-ls that possible?

8
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:10,133
We got company.

9
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:12,797
-They don't look happy to see us.
-Get us out of here.

10
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,647
-We're cut off!
-There's an intersection.

11
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,377
-lt's uncharted.
-Take it!

12
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,884
Get to the gun turrets!

13
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:52,271
Right.

14
00:03:52,682 --> 00:03:53,876
Come get some.

15
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,089
Hang on.

16
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,539
l've never seen the surface.

17
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:29,913
lt's nothing now but one big graveyard.

18
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:42,787
Oh, my God.

19
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,367
lt's an army.

20
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:52,073
-What is that thing?
-Some kind of tunneling machine.

21
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:53,674
-Oh, no.
-What?

22
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:56,835
Look where we are.
What's four kilometers straight down?

23
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:58,446
Zion.

00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,314

-Zion. Zion has to be warned!
-How?

26
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,476
-Someone had to get to a drop point.
-What? Are you crazy?

27
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:30,737
-We can't broadcast now!
-We have to.

28
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,177
-l'll go.
-There isn't much time.

00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,931
So did l.

32
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,567
Goodbye, Thadeus.

Goodbye, Jue.

-ls it important?
-Very.

39
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:42,200
-l hope it gets where it's supposed to go.
-Me too.

00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:46,808
-These days you never know.
-No, you never do.

00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:48,500

-Goodbye.

44
00:10:14,463 --> 00:10:16,988
Welcome to the Zion archive.

45
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:21,159
You have selected historical file
number 1 2- 1.

46
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,832
The Second Renaissance.

47
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:38,175
In the beginning, there was man.
And for a time, it was good.

48
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:43,223
But humanity's so-called civil societies...

49
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:48,091
...soon fell victim to vanity
and corruption.

50
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:51,722
He says, ''l'm sorry, sir,
l'm incapable of that function.''

51
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:59,631
Then man made the machine
in his own likeness.

52
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,142
Whoops! Pardon me.
Coming through.

53
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:19,959
Thus did man become the architect
of his own demise.

54
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:26,333
But for a time, it was good.

55
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,475
The machines worked tirelessly
to do man's bidding.

56
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,783
It was not long before
seeds of dissent took root.

57
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:22,447
Though loyal and pure, the machines
earned no respect from their masters...

58
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,458
...these strange,
endlessly multiplying mammals.

59
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:27,990
--hearing the prosecution's
closing statement...

60
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:31,633
...in what's expected to be
the final day of the B 1-66ER trial.

61
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:37,205
B 1-66ER.
A name that will never be forgotten.

62
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:41,139
For he was the first of his kind
to rise up against his masters.

63
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,040
--which that instrument
provides for and secures...

64
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:46,647
...to the citizens of the United States.

65
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:49,080
On the contrary, they were,
at that time...

66
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:53,051
...considered as a subordinate
and inferior class--

67
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:56,316
At B 1-66ER's murder trial...

68
00:12:56,492 --> 00:13:00,451
...the prosecution argued for
an owner's right to destroy property.

69
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:06,431
B 1-66ER testified that
he simply did not want to die.

70
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,807
Rational voices dissented.

71
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:18,078
Who was to say the machine,
endowed with the very spirit of man...

72
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:21,045
...did not deserve a fair hearing?

73
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:29,721
The leaders of men were quick to order
the extermination of B 1-66ER...

74
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,089
...and every one of his kind
throughout each province of the earth.

75
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:37,198
Androids and liberal sympathizers flooded
the streets of the nation's capital today.

76
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:40,961
--threat of violence to make good
on the legacy of B 1-66ER.

77
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:43,730
Fifteen thousand mechanicals
and human sympathizers...

78
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,307
...have continued their demonstration
in front of the Albany courthouse...

79
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:49,967
...in what has been dubbed
the ''Million Machine March. ''

80
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:54,775
The demonstrators have been met with
squads of defense forces in riot gear.

81
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,704
Robot bitch!

82
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:22,568
l got something for you!

83
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:27,782
Hold her up!

84
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,781
No, please!

85
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,149
-That's all, paint job!
-l'm real!

86
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,905
Die, bots, die!

87
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:42,417
Banished from humanity, the machines
sought refuge in their own promised land.

88
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,389
They settled in the cradle
of human civilization...

89
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:48,029
...and thus a new nation was born.

90
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,825
A place the machines could call home.

91
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,594
A place they could raise
their descendants.

92
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,865
And they christened the nation Zero-One.

93
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:03,506
Zero-One prospered.
And for a time, it was good.

94
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,207
The machines' artificial intelligence could
be seen in every facet of man's society...

95
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,912
...including, eventually,
the creation of new and better AI.

96
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:31,570
If you need the flexibility of a helipod
with the speed of an air jet...

97
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,071
...look no further!

98
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,143
Our patented vector-thrust coil
gives the Zero-One Versatran...

99
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:41,146
...the ability to sustain normal flight
in the event of a multiengine failure.

100
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:44,581
Versatran. It's the only choice.

101
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:48,689
No matter what the finance minister
says, the market has spoken:

102
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:51,587
The Human Nations' credit rating
is falling like a stone...

103
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,695
...while Zero-One's currency is climbing
without stopping for breath.

104
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:57,263
With headlines like that,
the markets have no choice--

105
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,300
But the leaders of men,
their power waning...

106
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:03,063
...refused to cooperate
with the fledgling nation...

107
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:06,799
...wishing rather
that the world be divided.

108
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:10,876
The world community of nations cannot
tolerate this kind of flagrant deception--

109
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,643
--today approved initiatives
for both economic sanctions...

110
00:17:14,817 --> 00:17:21,188
...and a naval blockade as a means
of containment and isolation of Zero-One.

111
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:53,317
Zero-One's ambassadors pleaded
to be heard.

112
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:57,823
At the United Nations, they presented
plans for a stable, civil relationship...

113
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,359
...with the nations of man.

114
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:06,325
Zero-One's admission to
the United Nations was denied.

115
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:13,804
But it would not be the last time
the machines would take the floor there.

116
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:50,867
[ENGLlSH]

117
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,330
And man said, ''Let there be light. ''

118
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:19,531
And he was blessed by light,
heat, magnetism, gravity...

119
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,836
...and all the energies of the universe.

120
00:19:30,786 --> 00:19:35,621
The prolonged barrage engulfed Zero-One
in the glow of a thousand suns.

121
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:41,087
But unlike their former masters
with their delicate flesh...

122
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,222
...the machines had little to fear
of the bombs' radiation and heat.

123
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:52,867
Thus did Zero-One's troops
advance outwards in every direction.

124
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:57,308
And one after another,
mankind surrendered its territories.

125
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,777
So the leaders of men conceived
of their most desperate strategy yet.

126
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,817
A final solution:

127
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:08,914
The destruction of the sky.

128
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:33,041
Lt. Gaeda, please report
to the Op Center.

129
00:20:33,248 --> 00:20:37,184
All right, you maggots! At 0800,
prepare to move out!

130
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:46,120
George Company, prepare to move out.
Charlie Company, prepare to move out.

131
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:55,033
Our Father who art in heaven,
we thank you for your....

132
00:20:57,873 --> 00:21:03,641
Put on your spiritual armor
to stand against the wiles of the devil.

133

Hotel Bravo, this is Papa One.
Operation Dark Storm initiated.

134
00:21:43,852 --> 00:21:48,118
Thus would man try to cut
the machines off from the sun...

135
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,850
...their main energy source.

136
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:56,729
May there be mercy on man
and machine for their sins.

137
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,544
-Go! Go!
-Kill them!

138
00:22:14,116 --> 00:22:17,313
Kill them all! Kill them all!
Kill them all!

139
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:46,371
Fire in the hole!

140
00:22:48,217 --> 00:22:53,883
Come on, get back out there.
Give us some more artillery.

141
00:22:56,191 --> 00:22:57,886
--9 o'clock,
near Mike Johnson's--

142
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:18,736
Hold on, I'm coming to get you!

143
00:23:18,914 --> 00:23:21,610
Keep firing, keep firing!

144
00:23:49,111 --> 00:23:52,137
Help me! Help me! No!

145
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:58,612
Help me! My God, help me!

146
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:26,412
The machines, having long studied
men's simple, protein-based bodies...

147
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:30,040
...dispensed great misery
upon the human race.

148
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:46,062
Victorious, the machines now turned
to the vanquished.

149
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:50,202
Applying what they had learned
about their enemy...

150
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:54,741
...the machines turned to an alternate
and readily available power supply:

151
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:00,007
The bioelectric, thermal and
kinetic energies of the human body.

152
00:25:02,985 --> 00:25:08,514
A newly-fashioned symbiotic relationship
between the two adversaries was born.

153
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,953
The machine drawing power
from the human body...

154
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:18,463
...an endlessly multiplying,
infinitely renewable energy source.

155
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:25,905
This is the very essence

As you wish.

165
00:32:23,057 --> 00:32:27,050
That was too easy. What's the problem?
Where's your concentration?

166
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,083
Maybe you regret taking the red pill.

A carefree life in the country.

171

The life we had
before knowing all this.

172
00:35:41,422 --> 00:35:44,949
Even if that life was just an illusion?

173

more at peace in the virtual world.

But l don't care about
the truth anymore.

What's real doesn't matter.

00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:15,163
What's important
is how we live our lives.

192

Are you listening to me?
You know l'm right.

This is your last chance.

Come with me.

212

l won't look away from the truth. l can't.

That's too bad. l'm sorry.

You know what I mean, Dinah?

229
00:42:25,193 --> 00:42:28,026
I used to think being
a private detective was cool.

230
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:31,262
Like Sam Spade
or Phillip Marlowe, right?

231
00:42:32,667 --> 00:42:35,727
But there's nothing cool left to it.

and my bank account are empty.

l'm out of this business forever.

-Hello?
-Mr. Ash, I have a job for you.

237
00:43:00,862 --> 00:43:04,423
And you need me
to check on your wife, right?

I'm looking for a computer hacker.

Well, it looks like we're still
in business, Dinah.

241
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,312
Fine. And who will l be working for?

242
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,253
-I can't say.
-You can't say.

Before you hang up, take a look
at your bank account balance.

246
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,539
I didn't get a good feeling
about the case.

247
00:44:23,344 --> 00:44:27,212
But I had no good reason
to turn the guy down now.

248
00:44:26,347 --> 00:44:28,747
This Trinity was well-known
in hacker circles.

249
00:44:30,685 --> 00:44:33,119
A real artist by the sound of it.

250
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:37,422
The cops were always
one step behind him.

251
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:40,558
So I knew I could get that close.
Question was, could I get closer?

252
00:44:47,535 --> 00:44:51,369
I had a few tricks up my sleeve
for getting to hackers.

253
00:44:57,678 --> 00:45:02,980
While I was searching,
I found something strange.

254
00:44:59,981 --> 00:45:02,609
Other detectives had been
on the case too.

255
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,662
And their investigations had all been,
shall we say, troubled.

256
00:45:30,044 --> 00:45:31,875
One of the guys killed himself.

257
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:36,784
Another had disappeared.

258
00:45:36,884 --> 00:45:39,011
Another went crazy.

259
00:45:45,927 --> 00:45:49,954
So I paid the one
who was left a visit.

260
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:57,229
The crazy one.

261
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:02,336
Trinity doesn't exist, man.
He's not real.

262
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:08,171
He's a figment. A cipher.
A jabberwocky.

263
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:11,647
And who am l? Who the hell am l?

264
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,795
Did I mention he was crazy?

265
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:31,596
Chessboards, jabberwocky,
Red Queen....

266
00:46:30,304 --> 00:46:32,772
I started searching
all the usual hacker hangouts...

267
00:46:34,175 --> 00:46:36,973
...for someone with
an Alice in Wonderland m.o.

268
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:41,170
Hacker bulletin boards,
anonymous mailboxes, chat rooms.

269
00:46:40,581 --> 00:46:44,608
And it was in one of those
that I picked up Trinity's trail.

270
00:46:43,818 --> 00:46:45,513
''Six brooks. ''

271
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,906
''I'll be there at 2005. ''

272
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,508
Of course!

Alice jumps the first brook...

275
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:22,852
...and....

276
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:26,619
And then she boards a train.

277
00:47:27,128 --> 00:47:28,755
Thanks.

278
00:47:31,899 --> 00:47:33,127
Excuse me.

279
00:47:34,569 --> 00:47:35,831
Hey!

280
00:47:35,903 --> 00:47:37,564
Hey!

281
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:40,534
l knew this was some kind of trap.

282
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:46,243
There's a difference, Mr. Ash,
between a trap and a test.

283
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:47,374
You were testing me?

284
00:47:48,649 --> 00:47:51,675
You made it. l'm impressed.

285
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,053
Flattery will get you everywhere.

286
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,122
l'm not here to flatter you,
l'm here to save you.

287
00:48:35,763 --> 00:48:37,594
What just happened?

288
00:48:39,033 --> 00:48:42,002
Mr. Ash, dream of having
an eye exam lately?

289
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:44,731
Yeah, how'd you know?

290
00:48:59,453 --> 00:49:02,479
You've stepped
to the edge of the looking glass.

291
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:06,121
So then, that means l wasn't dreaming.

292
00:49:06,394 --> 00:49:10,660
They hired me as a way
of getting to you, didn't they?

293
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,293
Go!

294
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:16,126
What the hell is going on here?
This is really crazy.

295
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:18,604
Now l understand what happened
to those other detectives.

296
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:20,070
They went nuts.

297
00:49:20,508 --> 00:49:22,635
What are you doing?
What are you doing, guys?

298
00:49:23,644 --> 00:49:27,273
Well, l've gotten out
of worse jams than this.

299
00:49:26,814 --> 00:49:29,681
l am not gonna let them get you.

300
00:49:29,483 --> 00:49:31,610
What's happening to me?

301
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,737
l'm sorry.

302
00:50:06,854 --> 00:50:09,618
You didn't make it, Mr. Ash.

303
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,565
l wish...

304
00:52:00,768 --> 00:52:03,066
...l could go with you.

305
00:52:05,673 --> 00:52:07,664
l don't blame you, you know.

306
00:52:16,617 --> 00:52:19,780
Everything that happened, Trinity,
it was all my fault.

307
00:52:17,985 --> 00:52:22,081
All that Through the Looking Glass stuff.

308
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:24,888
Can't get my head around it.
l'm old-fashioned.

309
00:52:25,126 --> 00:52:28,823
There's a difference between
a test and a choice.

310
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:32,497
For what it's worth,
l think you could've handled the truth.

311
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:34,460
lt was just a job.

312
00:52:35,336 --> 00:52:37,634

01:10:34,448 --> 01:10:36,416
l know, but l'm not withdrawing, Tom.

473
01:10:37,417 --> 01:10:40,545
Does the concept ''first in qualifying''
mean anything to you?

474
01:10:41,054 --> 01:10:43,318
That's enough already!
You hear me?

475
01:11:52,325 --> 01:11:55,783
This is all we've worked for!
lnjure yourself now and it's over!

476
01:11:54,428 --> 01:11:58,194
You'll lose everything! Over!
And you can kiss your career goodbye!

477
01:12:04,938 --> 01:12:07,429
l've made up my mind.
And l'm running tomorrow.

478
01:12:06,373 --> 01:12:07,533
Oh, are you?

479
01:12:09,476 --> 01:12:11,740
You may run,
but if you push yourself any more...

480
01:12:12,446 --> 01:12:15,006
...you'll be lucky to break
nine minutes!

481
01:12:16,349 --> 01:12:19,876
l mean, why bother?
lt's just not worth it, buddy.

482
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:29,058
No one will ever beat my record.
lt's the last chance for me to finally--

483
01:12:33,834 --> 01:12:35,301
What?

484
01:12:36,903 --> 01:12:38,803
Prove them wrong.

485
01:12:38,638 --> 01:12:39,832
Then do it without me.

486
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,459
Hey, Dan, you got a second?

487
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:10,534
-The clock's ticking.
-Just wanted to ask a few questions.

488
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:17,099
-You must be excited to run tomorrow.
-Always. l've never felt this good.

489
01:13:15,008 --> 01:13:18,273
So, what was it like
breaking 9.8 in the qualifying heat?

490
01:13:18,612 --> 01:13:21,945
Like nothing l've ever felt before.
lt's everything l've worked for.

491
01:13:21,615 --> 01:13:24,584
And now l'm just hoping
l can get back there again.

492
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:43,268
Someone once said
it feels like zero gravity.

493
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:46,237
You're released from the world
and you're totally free.

494
01:13:48,608 --> 01:13:50,974
That sounds amazing.
lt must be really nice.

495
01:13:52,245 --> 01:13:54,338
l mean, especially considering
what happened.

496
01:13:57,083 --> 01:14:00,052
Well, l'll tell you, there aren't
any reporters out there.

497
01:14:03,957 --> 01:14:06,949
All right, Dan, l guess
l'm going to take that as my cue.

498
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:15,357
But you should know even some of us
reporters are fans...

499
01:14:35,322 --> 01:14:37,950
...so l'll just say good luck to you.

500
01:14:39,492 --> 01:14:42,120
American Dan Davis is down!

501
01:14:42,562 --> 01:14:44,359
l have an unstable signal.

502
01:14:44,965 --> 01:14:47,991
He cannot wake up.
Do not let him wake up.

503
01:14:47,267 --> 01:14:52,000
Dan Davis of the United States
finishes with a time of 8.7 2 seconds...

504
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:53,062
...a new world record.

505
01:14:58,645 --> 01:14:59,839
l'll tell you something...

506
01:15:06,786 --> 01:15:10,222
...there's nothing quite like cherry pie
baked by my Aunt Daisy.

507
01:15:08,255 --> 01:15:11,622
She always bakes me one when l visit.
Look forward to it actually.

508
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:23,533
lt may sound like l'm bragging, but it's
really the best cherry pie in the world.

509
01:15:21,568 --> 01:15:24,594
She was a bit of an eccentric.
She didn't get along with my mom...

510
01:15:25,138 --> 01:15:27,971
...but l always loved her.
She taught me so many things.

511
01:15:27,307 --> 01:15:29,707
We'd go to Broadway musicals,
to the movies.

512
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:35,780
Now they call her
the ''queen of mystery literature.''

513
01:15:38,918 --> 01:15:41,386
Lives in an elegant villa
in the south of France.

514
01:15:45,892 --> 01:15:48,486
But, when l go visit,
she still bakes me her cherry pie.

515
01:15:51,731 --> 01:15:56,600
Something about biting into it, just
for that brief moment tasting perfection.

516
01:15:58,805 --> 01:16:00,602
Like leaving your body or something.

517
01:16:01,107 --> 01:16:04,076
Anyone can write a novel,
but no one can beat her cherry pie.

518
01:16:04,044 --> 01:16:07,536
An interesting case,
but nothing to be concerned about.

519
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:48,351
His memory of the race was expunged
with no residual effects.

520
01:16:54,361 --> 01:16:57,819
He will never run again.
He will never walk again, for that matter.

521
01:17:36,837 --> 01:17:41,831
We'll continue monitoring him
for a while, but anticipate no problems.

522
01:17:43,343 --> 01:17:47,609
A record that will live on
in people's memories for years to come.

523
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:48,380
What more could anyone ask for?

524
01:17:47,948 --> 01:17:49,813
Free....

525
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:41,562
Did you say something?

526
01:21:20,794 --> 01:21:22,728
Sit down.

527
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:25,498
Free....

528
01:21:25,365 --> 01:21:27,890
Sit down!

529
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,389
[ENGLlSH]

530
01:21:31,571 --> 01:21:36,099
Mr. Popper, what is my policy
on ringing phones in the classroom?

531
01:21:33,807 --> 01:21:35,468
-l'm sorry, sir.
-Yes, well...

532
01:21:35,842 --> 01:21:39,835
...you're barely passing my class
as it is, Mr. Popper.

533
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:43,274
-lt won't happen again, sir.
-For your sake, l hope not.

534
01:21:40,247 --> 01:21:42,545
l turned it off. l know l did.

535
01:21:42,249 --> 01:21:44,774
They know you know.
They're coming for you.

536
01:21:45,519 --> 01:21:47,987
Get out. Get out now!

537
01:21:49,322 --> 01:21:52,689
You are in serious trouble, Mr. Popper.

538
01:21:51,458 --> 01:21:53,153
Stop right there!

539
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:55,885
Mr. Popper.

540
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:02,231
Neo, l believe.
l know it wasn't a dream.

541
01:22:01,001 --> 01:22:06,462
This is not real.
And the real world lies somewhere else.

542
01:22:05,338 --> 01:22:10,332
A typical mental delusion. We get
unbalanced kids like this all the time.

543
01:22:08,842 --> 01:22:11,242
Reality can be a pretty scary thing
for some people.

544
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:13,639
This world must have been a cold
and alienating place for a boy like that.

545
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:15,880
lt's called denying reality.

546
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:20,882
lt's, you know, just a self-defense
mechanism for those type of kids.

547
01:22:36,269 --> 01:22:40,729
Well, he's in another world now.

548
01:22:39,673 --> 01:22:42,233
Make no mistake about that.

549
01:22:41,575 --> 01:22:44,373
His vitals are good. He's gonna make it.

550
01:22:44,144 --> 01:22:48,171
lt's unbelievable. l didn't think
self-substantiation was possible.

551
01:22:48,081 --> 01:22:50,049
Apparently, it is.

552
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:51,073
Neo.

553
01:23:52,545 --> 01:23:55,480
lt's okay. You're safe now.

554
01:29:51,337 --> 01:29:52,998
l knew...

555
01:29:54,474 --> 01:29:57,341
...you'd save me.

556
01:30:09,355 --> 01:30:11,414
l didn't save you, kid.

557
01:30:58,838 --> 01:31:01,602
You saved yourself.
