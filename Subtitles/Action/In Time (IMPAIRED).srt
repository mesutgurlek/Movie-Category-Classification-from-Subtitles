You got in late last night.

15

That's right.

Twenty-five for the 25th time.

22

Oh, I was sure I'd have a grandchild by now.

Here we go.

24

Bela's daughter is always asking about you.

25
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,754
Who has time for a girlfriend?
Besides, what's the hurry?

27

Three days. Not even.

28

We owe half that in rent.

Eight for the electric and
we're still late on that loan.

I can make extra on the side, you know.

31
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,102
- I could...
- What, start fighting?

32
00:02:58,778 --> 00:02:59,767
Nobody wins.

33

- Meet me at the bus stop tomorrow.

I just wouldn't know what to do if I lost you.

I'm late.

42

Let me give you 3o minutes
so you can have a decent lunch.

43
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,806
I love you.

44
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,809
Happy birthday, Mom.

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,948
When you get back,
we're going to celebrate.

Will!

48
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,824
You got a minute?

49
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,868
What are you talking about, Mya?
You have a whole year.

50
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,071
Not a year I can use yet.

51
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,904
Come on, Will. I've got bills to pay.

52
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,208
Here, take five minutes.

Yesterday, it was three.

56
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,439
You want coffee or you want to reminisce?

57
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,039
Two coffees.

58
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,104
- How many shifts you got today, Borel?
- Just the two.

59
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,880
Really excited about it.

Never met the quota.

65
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,003
My units are up from last week.

66
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,934
So's the quota. Next.

67

That's a joke, right?

To New Greenwich. The cameras picked up
on his suspicious behavior.

He's conscious of the surveillance,
