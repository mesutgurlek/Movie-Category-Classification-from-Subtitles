325
00:28:29,835 --> 00:28:32,133
When you gonna
give me the time of day?

326
00:28:32,204 --> 00:28:34,764
Well, let me call your wife
and see when you're available.

327
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,799
Aah. Why you gotta bring her
up? Talk about a buzz kill.

328
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:42,472
- You have a good one.
- You too.

329
00:28:42,548 --> 00:28:44,709
Now, how is it
that after eight years

330
00:28:44,783 --> 00:28:47,217
you have
only gotten younger?

331
00:28:48,554 --> 00:28:51,421
Oh, my God.
Will.

332
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,754
I can't believe it.

333
00:28:53,826 --> 00:28:55,987
- When did you get out?
- This morning.

334
00:28:56,061 --> 00:28:58,256
You should've let me know,
I would've picked you up.

335
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,265
That's all right. Agent Harland
was kind enough to give me a lift.

336
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:06,032
You're kidding. That guy needs
to get laid, like, yesterday.

337
00:29:06,105 --> 00:29:07,766
[clears throat]
Hmm.

338
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,138
Let me get you a drink.
Tequila?

339
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:12,507
Yes, ma'am.

340
00:29:12,578 --> 00:29:15,638
What the hell, Riley,
you're working in a cop bar?

341
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:19,374
Yeah, well, you know, it's a good way to
guarantee I don't go back to wrong.

342
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,311
Back to wrong?

343
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,877
Yeah. Self-restraint
was never my strong suit.

344
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:32,155
I'm honored
to be your first stop.

345
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:35,166
Actually, I dropped
by Alison's first.

346
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:36,895
Oh. And how is she?

347
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:41,969
Not as honored.

348
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,372
Don't worry, Will,
she'll come around.

349
00:29:44,443 --> 00:29:48,880
I missed you, Will. I never got to
thank you after all that went down.

350
00:29:48,947 --> 00:29:52,348
- Don't mention it.
- I wasn't allowed to come visit.

351
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:56,148
My lawyer wouldn't let me, and Harland
never really stopped sniffing around.

352
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:59,019
- So I just...
- I know. I know.

353
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:03,892
But you not ratting us out
really means something in my book.

354
00:30:03,962 --> 00:30:05,862
Like I said...

355
00:30:05,931 --> 00:30:07,523
You could've
ratted out Hoyt, though.

356
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,726
- That I wouldn't have minded.
- Hoyt.

357
00:30:09,802 --> 00:30:12,896
Yeah, I'm looking
for that guy.

358
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:17,670
And I take it
you heard about Vince.

359
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:19,005
Yes. That's terrible.

360
00:30:19,077 --> 00:30:21,272
I mean, he went really dark.

361
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,743
Well, I mean, do they
know who killed him?

362
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:31,085
No, I don't think so. He was
hanging out with the sketchy crowd.

363
00:30:31,156 --> 00:30:34,489
Looking for the new you,
I suppose.

364
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,993
It's good
to see you again, Riley.

365

366
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:45,497

your package.

369
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:56,178

- <i>I wanted to be there for you</i>
<i>at the prison.</i> - Vincent?

376
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:24,939
<i>Give you a welcome</i>

377
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,241
<i>But you know how it is,</i>
<i>time just slipped away.</i>

378
00:31:28,313 --> 00:31:30,281
Well, hallelujah, man.
You're alive.

379
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:34,786
Shit. You know what? Everybody's
telling me you're dead.

380
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:38,653
<i>I suppose that depends on your</i>
<i>interpretation of the word "dead."</i>

381

Well, where are you?
Can we meet? How are you?

383
00:31:46,732 --> 00:31:49,667
The years you've been gone
have not been kind to me, Gum.

384
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:51,794
Constantly running
from loan sharks,

385

<i>a dead-dicked dog.</i>

387

I am sorry
to hear about that.

388
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,841
You listen to me, Gum.

389
00:32:00,913 --> 00:32:03,814
I have been waiting
eight years for this.

390
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:05,543
Go ahead.

391
00:32:05,617 --> 00:32:07,847
I had to change my name,
erase everything.

392
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,616
And then there's that little
matter of the bullet in my leg.

393
00:32:10,689 --> 00:32:15,524
A constant friendly reminder of the
partner who ruined my life that night.

394
00:32:15,594 --> 00:32:17,960
Come on, man. Really?
We're gonna go back there?

395
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,327
You did that to yourself.

396
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:21,958
Semantics.
I want my share.

397
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:25,470
I want my share
of the $10 million

398

<i>that was gonna</i>
<i>change our lives forever.</i>

Vinnie, there is no cash.

400
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:36,977
[coughs] I had a feeling
you'd say that, Gum.

401
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:39,483
I burned it just before
Harland got to me.

402
00:32:39,551 --> 00:32:42,384
No. Stop it.

403

Wait a minute. Who...
That voice, who was that?

407
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,793
Oh, that's right, you don't
know. I'm a cab driver now.

408
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:58,392
My fare
is this sweet little girl

409
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,062
trying to get
to her shrink's office

410
00:33:00,138 --> 00:33:02,072
so she can discuss
her daddy issues

411
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:06,577
and how they have manifested
into an unhealthy disdain

412
00:33:06,645 --> 00:33:09,580
...for the world at large.
- Hey, what are you doing?

413
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:12,742
Hold on, please, Gum.

414

426
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:14,979
<i>What are we doing?</i>
<i>Why are we in here?</i>

427
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:18,039
I hope you understand
this is not my preference.

428
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:22,285
Help me!
No! Help!

429
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:24,618
I mean,
considering your father,

430
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:26,657
I would never want
to add to your suffering.

431

But you see, Alison?

432
00:34:32,164 --> 00:34:35,065
I've got a sickness.
I'm not well.

433
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:42,405
Your father abandoned me
in my time of need...

434
00:34:42,474 --> 00:34:46,467
So I know what it is to be in the
position you're in. Really, I do.

435
00:34:46,545 --> 00:34:51,278
I know what it is to be left
high and dry by Will Montgomery.

436
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:55,445
And you and me,
we're kindred spirits,

437
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,920
and I am going to make him
pay for the both of us.

whether she's going to remain fine.

00:38:52,157 --> 00:38:56,093
- Shit!
- Will Montgomery is here to see you.

479
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:58,891
Send him in.

480
00:38:58,963 --> 00:39:02,729
So your dead former partner, Vincent
Kinsey, has kidnapped your daughter

481
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:04,735
and is holding her
somewhere in New Orleans?

482
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:07,397
- In a cab. - The cab, yes,
that's right. In a cab, yeah.

483
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:10,032
And what does
he want in return?

484
00:39:10,108 --> 00:39:13,077
- $10 million.
- $10 million.

485
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:16,238
Remind me why that's a familiar figure.

486
00:39:16,314 --> 00:39:19,249
I burned the cash.

487
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:24,421
Just before
you grabbed me.

488
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:26,457
<i>(Harland)</i>
<i>William Montgomery.</i>

489
00:39:26,524 --> 00:39:28,458
That's the God's honest truth.

490
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:31,620
'Cause I knew I'd get less
time if I ditched the money.

491
00:39:31,696 --> 00:39:39,034
I don't have it, but he has my
daughter and I need your help.

492
00:39:39,104 --> 00:39:41,038
Why would I be here
if I had the money?

493
00:39:41,106 --> 00:39:43,370
I would just pay Vincent off
and get my little girl back.

494
00:39:43,441 --> 00:39:44,931
This is how
I see it, Will.

495
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:46,601
You're a thief,
a crook, and a scumbag,

496
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:48,942
but you're also
a very clever tree frog.

497
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:53,313
So you concoct this Kinsey-is-alive-
and-has-snatched-my-kid fantasy

498
00:39:53,385 --> 00:39:56,149
so that, A, you can show
that you don't have the money,

499
00:39:56,221 --> 00:39:58,052
otherwise, why wouldn't you
pay the ransom,

500
00:39:58,123 --> 00:40:01,320
or, B, send us
running around all over town

501
00:40:01,393 --> 00:40:03,953
searching for your daughter
and her abductor

502
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:06,963
to afford you the time
to dig up the dough

503
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:08,999
and jump onto
a cigarette boat

504
00:40:09,067 --> 00:40:12,093
and zip down to the Bahamas
where you can sip rum

505
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:16,231
for the rest of your days
and listen to classic rock

506
00:40:16,307 --> 00:40:20,471
played by bands with muscular
guitars and dead drummers.

507
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:27,681
Oh, my faithful bloodhound.

508
00:40:27,752 --> 00:40:30,550
Couldn't find your couch
in the living room.

509
00:40:31,923 --> 00:40:33,982
This is Vincent's file.

510
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:36,526
The prints match,
as you can see.

511
00:40:36,594 --> 00:40:39,324
They cut his body up
before they burnt it.

512
00:40:39,397 --> 00:40:44,926
We got the prints off the few
fingers that survived the fire.

513
00:40:45,003 --> 00:40:47,028
We can visit
his grave if you want.

514
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:49,869
No, we can't, because he's
alive. He faked his own death.

515
00:40:49,941 --> 00:40:55,243
Please. Tim.
I'm running out of time.

516
00:40:55,313 --> 00:40:59,374
I'm not being played
by you again, Will.

517
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:00,941
- Fletcher?
- Yeah.

518
00:41:02,454 --> 00:41:04,718
All right, let's go.

519
00:41:06,191 --> 00:41:07,556
Please help me.

520
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,794
Escort our pal out of
the building, will you?

521
00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:16,059
A little help, guys.

522
00:41:16,134 --> 00:41:19,570
Well, Montgomery, on behalf of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation,

523
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:23,903
we'd like to thank you
for stopping by today.

524
00:41:23,975 --> 00:41:25,636
Hold up. Hold up.

525
00:41:36,154 --> 00:41:39,715
- Harland thinks you're some kind of
criminal mastermind. - Criminal mastermind?

526
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:42,555
I don't share this belief
because criminal masterminds

527
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:44,754
don't go away for
eight-year jolts, or do they?

528
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:47,423
[grunting, shouting]

00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:08,781
One more, please.

530
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,157
Thank you.

531
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:18,526
We called Montgomery's
ex home and cell.

532
00:42:18,596 --> 00:42:20,154
Both voicemails
say she's out of town.

533
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,465
Have you tried
his daughter's cell phone?

534
00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:29,939
The account's been suspended
per request of the stepfather.

535
00:42:34,646 --> 00:42:36,739
Get local PD on it.

536
00:42:36,814 --> 00:42:39,305
If she has been kidnapped, we're
FBI, we do something about it.

537
00:42:39,384 --> 00:42:40,976
You don't think
he's telling the truth?

538
00:42:41,052 --> 00:42:41,541
No, I do not.

539
00:43:08,746 --> 00:43:11,613

anybody out there?

Yeah, you are the exactly the woman
I want to see in clothes that tight.

551

The only thing
with any balls

552
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:48,810
to come to this town
was the hurricane.

- Cab's off duty, man.

Yeah, mate?
Mate, I'm trying.

565
00:45:30,354 --> 00:45:34,916

Hey mate, so let me tell
you about these sheilas, eh?

569
00:45:44,202 --> 00:45:46,466
So the preggers one,
she seemed most interested.

00:45:46,537 --> 00:45:49,005
Buggered if I know why, but
my willie's about as lonely

572

I don't know
about these chicks.

They're quite different
in New Orleans, aren't they?

574
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,639
New Orleans
all comes back...

575
00:45:59,717 --> 00:46:03,153
to a pudgy kid by the
name of King Louis XV.

576

King Louis XV,
he owned all this.

So in order to get
some use out of it,

You're more like him than I

You were young, I guess, and
I did look a little different.

686

I had all my fingers then,

Ah, nice fingers,

But one day
I came up with a plan.

691
00:56:30,481 --> 00:56:32,472
Yeah, I dug up a body.
See, it wasn't hard.

692
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:34,449
Resemblance was reasonable.

693
00:56:34,518 --> 00:56:36,611
Then I cut him up
into small pieces.

694
00:56:36,687 --> 00:56:39,656
And added a little
of myself to the mix.

I was a golden boy,
doll face.

696

Now I'm a freakin' Picasso.

- It's a meter.

No, I know what a meter
is, asshole. Not that, this.

703

It's a GPS. Everyone has 'em
in case the cars are stolen.

- Tells you their location?
- Within a few blocks, yeah.

to put on a biohazard suit,

that crap out there.

- Looked like boogers or jalapeno
jelly, Bertrand. - I got a question for you.

Nine inches, and can reload
after 14 minutes and a tickle.

- <i>What else do you want to know?</i>
- About the driver.

Is this about me docking your pay
again 'cause of the fender bender?

The same policy applies for
everybody, and I ain't lifting it.

- No, it's not about that.
- White guy with a fake leg.

- He's a white man with a fake leg.
- Maybe some missing fingers.

- Really?
- Tell him!

00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:09,679
And maybe
missing some fingers.

719
00:58:09,746 --> 00:58:11,873

with me today?

<i>I give a snot, huh?</i>

He's stealing fares.
Pocketing.

- Get his location.
- Where is he right now?

727

What you wanna
know that for?

728
00:58:32,269 --> 00:58:34,601
I'll confront him for you.
Get the truth.

729
00:58:39,009 --> 00:58:41,034
You would do that
for me, Bertrand?

You're a good boss.

787
01:04:09,406 --> 01:04:11,271
I don't have it.

788
01:04:11,341 --> 01:04:13,241
Or better yet, why don't
you tell me how Hoyt's doing,

789
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:15,073
<i>seeing as that's</i>
<i>where you were anyway?</i>

790
01:04:15,145 --> 01:04:17,773
I don't have the money.

791
01:04:17,848 --> 01:04:19,577
What did I say to you
about lying to me?

792
01:04:19,649 --> 01:04:22,618
I'm sorry,
I just, I just...

793
01:04:22,686 --> 01:04:27,623
- Your daughter's dead.
- No, wait! Wait!

794
01:04:27,691 --> 01:04:30,888
You really
don't have it, do you?

795
01:04:30,961 --> 01:04:33,452
- I'll get you the money.
- <i>(Vincent) Good.</i>

796
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:34,861
May I ask how?

797
01:04:39,336 --> 01:04:41,361
By going back to wrong.

798
01:04:50,814 --> 01:04:52,782
He got away on foot.
He went down the alley, okay?

799
01:04:52,849 --> 01:04:54,441
We gotta
set up a perimeter.

800
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:56,485
Let's move.
Clear out!

801
01:05:33,757 --> 01:05:35,884
(phone ringing)

802
01:05:41,865 --> 01:05:42,695
Hello?

803
01:06:35,452 --> 01:06:37,079
What's going on?

804
01:06:37,153 --> 01:06:39,018
- Why are the feds after you?
- There's no time.

805
01:06:39,089 --> 01:06:41,387
- Vincent's alive.
- What? What are you talking about?

806
01:06:41,458 --> 01:06:45,724
He wants $10 million. He wants it
in three hours, and he has Alison.

807
01:06:45,795 --> 01:06:46,591
Oh, my God.

808
01:06:48,565 --> 01:06:50,089
The bank
we robbed that night,

809
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:52,066
there was something else
in the vault.

810
01:06:52,135 --> 01:06:54,933
A gold reserve, there must've
been 100 million, easy.

811
01:06:55,005 --> 01:06:56,768
There's no way
you can walk in there

812
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,570
and steal $10 million
worth of gold bricks

813
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:01,109
in the middle
of a business day.

814
01:07:01,177 --> 01:07:03,737
But that's why
I need your help.

815
01:07:03,813 --> 01:07:05,838
I already told you,
this isn't my life anymore.

816
01:07:05,915 --> 01:07:08,782
- I know. I know.
- It's not yours either.

817
01:07:08,852 --> 01:07:12,049
He's going to kill her.

818
01:07:12,122 --> 01:07:15,114
I, I can hear it
in his voice.

819
01:07:15,191 --> 01:07:18,422
He's not the same person.

820
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:22,294
He's going to kill
my little girl.

821
01:07:28,538 --> 01:07:29,903
Okay.

822
01:07:29,973 --> 01:07:31,201
Okay.

823
01:07:34,944 --> 01:07:36,935
(sirens)

824
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,186
Oh, man.

825
01:07:49,726 --> 01:07:53,321
- You LeFleur?
- Yes sir, I am. LeFleur, yes sir.

826
01:07:53,396 --> 01:07:56,126
A guy jacked your cab a little while
ago. He was looking for someone?

827
01:07:56,199 --> 01:07:59,635
Well, he was looking for
that mope, Jimmy Morgan, sir.

828
01:07:59,702 --> 01:08:01,670
Be a peach and show me
his hack license, will you?

829
01:08:01,738 --> 01:08:03,933
Yes, yes, officer, sir.

830
01:08:04,007 --> 01:08:05,838
I'll look it up
for you, inspector.

831
01:08:05,909 --> 01:08:07,774
<i>He been with us</i>
<i>two years.</i>

832
01:08:07,844 --> 01:08:10,005
Never any problem.

833
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:12,776
Although he do
scare my kids

834
01:08:12,849 --> 01:08:16,478
when they come to visit
their daddy at work.

835
01:08:16,553 --> 01:08:18,350
My kids
are in their 20s.

836
01:08:23,093 --> 01:08:24,424
Vincent Kinsey.

837
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:27,923
Much obliged.

838
01:08:29,265 --> 01:08:30,197
Let's go.

839
01:08:37,607 --> 01:08:39,598
(sirens)

840
01:08:44,447 --> 01:08:47,382
Fat Tuesday,
everybody go crazy.

841
01:09:25,655 --> 01:09:28,249
We're six blocks away from
the bank, you do realize that.

842
01:09:28,324 --> 01:09:30,155
- Have a little faith.
- Okay.

843
01:09:33,429 --> 01:09:36,159
(Will) I've considered doing
this for the last 8 years.

844
01:10:15,205 --> 01:10:17,503
(Will) Thirty meters, then we go left.

845
01:11:26,776 --> 01:11:30,507
Montgomery doesn't have the
money, but he needs the money,

846
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:32,980
which means he's only got
one play left to make.

847
01:11:33,049 --> 01:11:37,213
Get me a list of every bank that he's
stepped into in the city of New Orleans.

848
01:11:37,287 --> 01:11:40,017
My guess is one of them
he's going to step into again.

849
01:11:52,302 --> 01:11:53,098
We're through.

850
01:11:55,305 --> 01:11:57,603
- Five minutes till the alarm.
- Think that'll be enough?

851
01:12:06,716 --> 01:12:07,944
<i>(Will)</i>
<i>Here it comes.</i>

852
01:12:52,662 --> 01:12:54,960
(alarm buzzing)

853
01:12:55,031 --> 01:12:57,795
Fire alarm just went off
at Parish Community Bank.

854
01:12:57,867 --> 01:13:00,199
<i>(Harland) That's him.</i>
<i>Get us there now!</i>

855
01:13:06,576 --> 01:13:08,237
<i>(Firefighter)</i>
<i>Let's go, boys.</i>

856
01:13:26,796 --> 01:13:28,821
The alarm will have
triggered by now. We gotta go.

857
01:13:28,898 --> 01:13:31,128
I just want to see if I can get
a little more gold out of it.

858
01:13:35,004 --> 01:13:38,405
Come on, guys, let's go!
Go, go, go!

859
01:14:06,502 --> 01:14:07,867
Could you please
hurry up, sir?

860
01:14:07,937 --> 01:14:08,767
(vault beeping)

861
01:14:10,606 --> 01:14:12,437
Come on, Will,
we gotta go.

862
01:14:14,877 --> 01:14:16,276
Come on!

863
01:14:28,257 --> 01:14:29,121
Huh.

864
01:14:31,527 --> 01:14:33,188
<i>(Harland)</i>
<i>Well, what do you know.</i>

865
01:15:16,072 --> 01:15:18,939
So, you worked all this out from prison?

866
01:15:19,008 --> 01:15:20,600
I was bored.

867
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:26,114
Boss, hey. Listen to this. Say again.

868
01:15:26,182 --> 01:15:28,776
<i>We have the two suspects.</i>
<i>They're in Rileys truck</i>

869
01:15:28,851 --> 01:15:30,546
<i>on North Reters</i>
<i>headin' towards the ferry.</i>

870
01:15:30,620 --> 01:15:32,520
Do not take them
until they're off the ferry.

871
01:15:32,588 --> 01:15:35,455
I repeat, do not take them
until they're off the ferry.

872
01:15:35,525 --> 01:15:37,959
We take them now.
We got 'em boxed in.

873
01:15:38,027 --> 01:15:40,359
<i>(Harland) You don't corner a weasel</i>
<i>unless you wanna get bit.</i>

874
01:15:40,429 --> 01:15:42,590
I hope you know what you're
doing. Takes eight minutes

875
01:15:42,665 --> 01:15:45,463
...to get across the river on that ferry.
- Wait for strength in numbers.

876
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,901
And when we get Montgomery,
he'll be as red-handed

877
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:52,737
as the boy who put his palm on the
gas stove to see how hot it really was.

878
01:15:52,808 --> 01:15:53,797
Okay.

879
01:16:00,983 --> 01:16:04,817
Don't make a move until all
four wheels touch Louisiana soil.

880
01:16:04,887 --> 01:16:06,081
<i>(Agent)</i>
<i>Copy that.</i>

881
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,012
Hands in the air.

882
01:16:36,085 --> 01:16:37,245
Hands in the air now!

883
01:16:40,523 --> 01:16:43,083
Happy Fat Tuesday, officer.

884
01:17:39,115 --> 01:17:41,208
Come on.
Come on.

885
01:17:41,283 --> 01:17:44,411
Come on, get out.
Get out!

886
01:17:44,487 --> 01:17:47,251

887

<i>(Vincent)</i>
<i>Time is up, buddy.</i>

888
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:50,183
I've got it.

889
01:17:50,259 --> 01:17:53,558
Ah, I am impressed.

890
01:17:53,629 --> 01:17:56,063
You listen to a little
Creedence before you went in?

891
01:17:56,132 --> 01:18:02,037
No, I didn't listen to CCR. That didn't
work out so well the last time, did it?

892
01:18:02,104 --> 01:18:03,628
I missed you, old buddy.

893
01:18:03,706 --> 01:18:05,503
I want to talk to her.

894
01:18:05,574 --> 01:18:07,542
No, you'll talk to her
when you give me the money.

895
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:09,237
I wanna talk
to my daughter now!

896
01:18:09,311 --> 01:18:12,075
<i>I wanna hear her voice now!</i>

897
01:18:12,148 --> 01:18:13,615
It's your father.

898
01:18:13,683 --> 01:18:15,583
- Hello?
- Alison.

899
01:18:15,651 --> 01:18:17,448
Alison, did he hurt you?

900
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,580
No, but he scares me.

901
01:18:20,656 --> 01:18:22,886
I'm gonna be there soon.
I'm gonna get you outta this.

<i>(Will)</i>
<i>This is my fault.</i>

904
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:45,806
Sorry, boss.

905
01:18:45,881 --> 01:18:49,817
Finally starting to recognize the
skills of Will Montgomery, huh?

906
01:18:49,885 --> 01:18:51,978
You got those listings
from the cab dispatcher?

907
01:18:52,054 --> 01:18:54,488
GPS breakdowns?
Yeah, why?

908
01:18:54,557 --> 01:18:56,582
I told you Kinsey
ditched his GPS

909
01:18:56,659 --> 01:18:58,650
in the back of a cab
in the French Quarter.

910
01:18:58,728 --> 01:19:01,253
I'm not interested in today's.
I wanna see the last few weeks.

911
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:03,389
Kinsey's gonna get the
money from Montgomery,

912
01:19:03,466 --> 01:19:06,026
then he's gonna have to have
some kind of neutral rendezvous.

913
01:19:06,102 --> 01:19:08,502
And if that's the case,
he's been casing it for weeks.

914
01:19:08,571 --> 01:19:10,801
Uptown, Lakefront,
Beauvoir, Gretna,

915

- West Bank.
- Beauvoir?

916
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:15,802
- Is that the fairground?
- Yeah, I think so.

917
01:19:15,878 --> 01:19:17,937
Twenty minutes
from out of town?

918
01:19:18,013 --> 01:19:20,447
- That doesn't sound like a cab ride to me.
- Nicely done, boss.

919
01:19:20,516 --> 01:19:21,983
We might actually
catch this prick.

920
01:20:00,022 --> 01:20:01,387
Where's Alison?

921
01:20:06,395 --> 01:20:08,090
In the trunk?

922
01:20:10,299 --> 01:20:14,201
You look good, Will.
The same.

923
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:16,704
Where is she?

924
01:20:16,772 --> 01:20:18,603
She's safe.

925
01:20:40,329 --> 01:20:42,559
The money.
Hand her over.

926
01:20:45,167 --> 01:20:47,158
I said, hand her over!

927
01:20:48,671 --> 01:20:50,730
You got the money.
You win.

929
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:54,233
Over a janitor.

930
01:20:54,310 --> 01:21:01,079
You piss away 14 years of
friendship over an old man janitor?

931
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:03,744
We're not killers.

932
01:21:03,819 --> 01:21:05,616
Well, maybe not then.

933
01:21:05,688 --> 01:21:10,250
None of this has anything
to do with my daughter.

934
01:21:10,326 --> 01:21:12,089
But it does, Will.

935
01:21:12,161 --> 01:21:14,629
Because you truly
love Alison.

936
01:21:14,697 --> 01:21:18,565
And in that single act
of betrayal eight years ago,

937
01:21:18,634 --> 01:21:24,300
you destroyed the only
thing I ever truly loved.

938
01:21:26,809 --> 01:21:28,037
Me.

939
01:21:34,717 --> 01:21:36,207
No! No!

940
01:21:39,555 --> 01:21:40,613
Daddy!

Are you gonna
send him back to jail?

Now, why would I do that?

976
01:26:41,089 --> 01:26:42,920
I'm sure that Vincent
Kinsey stole that gold.

He's got it. He's got that
missing ten pounds of gold.

- Don't do it. No, no, no.

1001
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:22,180
Do it.

1002
01:29:29,691 --> 01:29:32,455
Sure, yeah,
keep it, sell it.

Get rich.

1004
01:29:34,663 --> 01:29:36,028
And then
go back to jail.

1005
01:29:38,867 --> 01:29:41,859
Okay. All right.
It's going in.

1006
01:29:54,015 --> 01:29:56,779
Oh, thank you, Will.
