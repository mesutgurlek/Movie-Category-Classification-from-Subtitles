-Yeah.

-Apparently you like a little edge.
-All I can get, sir.

He's no animal of any kind. Remember.

units that will be on duty by dark tonight.

310
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,788
-Double shifts and overtime.
-Just at nighttime.

311
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,874
Daylight hours, the helicopters
will keep him off the roofs.

312
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:32,087
We're going for high visibility. Units
will make themselves very noticeable.

BRESSLER: Right. The North Beach area.

We're saving that for him.

315
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,719
-Have you found a good stakeout?
-I think so.

316
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:44,057
It's a building that overlooks the roof
where they spotted him yesterday.

317
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,309
Something bothering you, Gonzales?

318
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:50,355
-No, no, nothing.
-Well, speak up. You're among friends here.

319
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,692
It seems like a long shot
that he'd come back to the same roof.

320
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,112
I mean, there are a lot of rooftops
in San Francisco.

321
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,866
Most of them are locked.
This particular one'll be open for him.

00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,870
You see, these sick guys
have behavior patterns.

323
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:09,082
We know for a fact they'll rob the very
same store three, four times in a row.

00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,002

superego or something.

They like that feeling.

327
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,802
There's one other reason
why he might pick the same rooftop.

328
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,097
It's got a very clear view
of the St. Peter and Paul's Church.

00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,516

-Yeah, he wanted to.

...you've got a right
to kick down doors, torture suspects?

What I'm saying is,
that man had rights.

Well, I'm all broken up
about that man's rights.

to leave the hospital, he walks.

He's free!

-You mean you're letting him go?
-We have to. We can't try him.

619
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,467
And why is that?

620
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:12,762
Because I'm not wasting a half-million
dollars of the taxpayers...

621
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,181
...on a trial we can't possibly win.

622
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,142
The problem is,
we don't have any evidence.

623
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:21,312
-Evidence? What the hell do you call that?
ROTHKO: I call it nothing.

624
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:22,980
Zero.

625
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:28,236
Are you trying to tell me Ballistics
can't match the bullet up to this rifle?

626
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,489
It does not matter what Ballistics can do.

627
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,784
This rifle might make a nice souvenir.

628
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:38,454
-But it's inadmissible as evidence.
-Who says that?

629
01:13:38,622 --> 01:13:39,831
It's the law.

630
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,041
Well, then the law is crazy.

631
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:46,045
This is Judge Bannerman
of the appellate court.

632
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:51,175
He also holds classes in constitutional law
at Berkeley. I've asked him for an opinion.

633

Your Honor?

634
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:58,641
Well, in my opinion, the search
of the suspect's quarters was illegal.

635
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:03,020
Evidence obtained thereby,
such as that hunting rifle, for instance...

636
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,523
...is inadmissible in court.

637
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:09,360
You should have gotten
a search warrant. I'm sorry...

638
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:12,864
-...but it's that simple.
-Search warrant? There was a girl dying.

639
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:16,200
She was, in fact, dead
according to the medical report.

640
01:14:16,368 --> 01:14:17,618
But I didn't know that.

641
01:14:18,078 --> 01:14:19,829
The court would have to recognize...

642
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:23,040
...the police officer's legitimate concern
for the girl's life...

643
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:27,503
...but there is no way they can
possibly condone police torture.

644
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:31,757
All evidence concerning the girl,
the suspect's confession...

645
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:35,845
...all physical evidence
would have to be excluded.

646
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:43,769
There must be something
you can get him on.

647
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:47,023
Without the evidence
of the gun and the girl?

648
01:14:47,774 --> 01:14:50,568
I couldn't convict him
of spitting on the sidewalk.

649
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:54,697
Now, the suspect's rights...

650
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,741
...were violated...

651
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:59,118
...under the 4th and 5th...

652
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:02,205
...and probably the 6th
and 14th Amendments.

653
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:04,999
And Ann Mary Deacon,
what about her rights?

I mean, she's raped and left in a hole
to die. Who speaks for her?

What is that supposed to mean?

That means sooner or later,
he'll stub his toe and I'll be there.
