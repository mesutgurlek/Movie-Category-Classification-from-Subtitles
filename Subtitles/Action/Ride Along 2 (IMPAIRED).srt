What you got here?

This looks like
more than just drugs.

JAMES: Mayfield is out for
weeks because of you,

182
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,710
and you bring him flowers?
It's a bad choice.

183
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Well, I disagree.

184

I'm the only one that got
Mayfield something, James.

Because you the one
that got him shot!

186
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,349
Okay, well, listen. I went to the
gift shop. They had two choices.

187
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,960
He's not pregnant,
so I went with this.

I just thought it
was a better fit.

189

This is
next-level hacking.

209
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,919
The only way we
got lucky is because

210

our guy has an ego
and he left his tag.

This guy, out of Miami.

let me talk to Brooks.

JAMES: No.

So Troy's
trying to become

218
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,556
the new kingpin of Atlanta,
and what do you do?

219
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,392

of the city's money,

a parking structure,

you get your
partner shot? Nice.

222
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,749
Well, in his defense,
Mayfield wasn't his true partner.

00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,876
The grown-ups
are speaking, Ben.

224

You need to get me
something on this guy.

I've got three,
maybe four days

226

before I have
to let him go.

227

Look, I found
a guy in Miami

228

that encrypted
Troy's flash drive.

229
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,714
I think he can lead me
to Troy's supplier.

230
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,677
I need to go down there
and scoop this dude up.

put that team together...

an inch from being fired.

can't teach what I have.

Hmm?

The Psych department
wants me to take less responsibility.

Mr. Barber here

is still technically in
his work placement,

250
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,395
so if you wanna take
him to Miami, you can.

251
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,637
But if he screws up,
in any way, it's on you.

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,994

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,634
I'll fly solo.
All right.

256
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,268
What was that, man?

257
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,476
You're supposed to have
my back back there, James.

258
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,800
We family.
Family's not supposed

259
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,909
to be letting shit
go down like that.

260
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,036
Stop. Stop.
It's not about family.

261
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,435
It's not about friends.
It's not about feelings.

262
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,909
It's about you not knowing
how serious this work is.

263
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,240
I know how serious
this work is.

264
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,633
That's why I know
I need to be on the team.

265
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,359
No, you don't.
You're just a rookie.

266
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,875
You got lucky on your
first little police case, man.

267
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,871
That was the worst thing
to ever happen to you.

268

Turned you into a monster.

269

ready, but you're not.

That's why you need
to take me with you,

272
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,640
so I can prove it to you, Lieutenant,
and everybody else.

273
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,871
Whoa! You don't gotta prove nothing to me.
You almost got us killed.

274

Don't let one
incident define me.

with a straight face?

Do you wanna be responsible
for ruining my career?

277

I don't care!
And you shouldn't either.

You're getting
married in a week.

279

You should stay here and help
Angela with the wedding.

it's a milk run.

Two days, tops.
Those are your words.

282
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,837
I can't go back to
marry Angela as no scrub.

283
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,040
You told me to prove myself,

284
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,760
that's what I'm trying to do!
Let me do it!

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,353
Nope. You don't listen.

286

00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,719
AUTOMATED VOICE: Game over.
(CORI CHUCKLES)

321
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,519
ANGELA: That is why I hired you, Cori.
You're the best.

322
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,635
CORI: I know.

323
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,598
CORI: We have
12 tables over here.

324
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,148
If we put flower arrangements
at about half,

325
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,879
and then we can do a vase
with crystal around it.

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,240
ANGELA: (GASPS) I love it.
Cori?

327
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,435
Ben.

328
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,668
I didn't know we were
having a meeting today.

329
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,593
I didn't get
that memo.

330
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,189
We just thought
we could do some

331
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,952
last-minute wedding
details, that's all.

332
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,439
Oh.

333
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,115
Without me?

334
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Huh.

335
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,353
If that's the case, then I'll just...
(CLICKS TONGUE)

336
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,674
Listen from afar.

337
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,474
Thank you, Ben.
BEN: Yep.

338
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,837
I am so excited
to tell you,

339
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,558
my associate
has the best

340
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,359
hydrangea connection
in all of Atlanta.

341
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,033
BEN: No.

342
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,629
Now, for the
final seating chart,

343
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,955
I've decided to move
everyone to Table Five,

344
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,474
because I don't want anything
overshadowing your wedding.

345
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,232
Perfect.
Table Five, that's the perfect table.

346
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,998
No, we can't sit
them right there.

347
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,115
We can't do that?
Why?

348
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,589
We can't put my uncle and
Carol at the same table.

349
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,119
They used to be
on that stuff together.

350
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,792
You want all these people
Electric Sliding all night?

351
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
That's what'll happen.

352
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,638
Fine. I'll move him.

353
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,393
Angela, no! You're
not moving anyone.

354
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,948
Ben.

355
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,393
You've had
your opportunities.

356
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,072
And you've
ignored them all, Cori.

357
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,269
Let me ask
you a question.

358
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,351
Have you looked at my Dreamboard
that I posted online?

359
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,351
Looked at my color wheel?
My glam shots?

360
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,034
Why am I doing this?
Why am I going back and forth with you?

361
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
This is my wedding!

362
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,958
Okay. And I got
a vision for my wedding.

363
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,271
A magnificent vision
that will not be ignored by you.

364
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,429
She's not ignoring.

365
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,556
No. Baby, she is ignoring it.
She hasn't addressed it.

366
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,789
Excuse me?
Cori.

367
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,154
Who are you walking
up on, all swelling up?

368
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,390
Do you know the level
of who you're dealing with?

369
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,948
I'm a First Ballot Hall of Famer.
(SCOFFS)

370
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,837
I crap out high-end clients.

371
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,319
That's a little too much
information for me.

372
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,549
CORI: And they
keep coming back.

373
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,995
Why? Because I have taste.

374
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,440
I'm not gonna do
this with you. No.

375
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,391
Reason why is because I'm not...
What are you doing?

376
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,640
Baby...
Baby, just help me up.

377
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,591
I'm not intimidated
by you.

378
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,995
I'm a cop.
Real badge. Authentic.

379
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,433
What you gonna
do is respect it.

380
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,353
Also respect the fact
that you are my employee!

381
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,759
Your employee?
That's right.

382
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,633
Don't you step...
Look, cop.

383
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,553
What you need to do,
is you need to step the hell back

384
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,359
and let me create
the wedding of your dreams!

385
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,635
What I'm gonna do
is step up!

386
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,914
No!
I'm sick of this shit!

387
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
(SCREAMS)

388
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Ben...

389
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,313
(BEN GROANING)

390
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,356
So, I guess we'll go
with my vision now.

391
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,953
Get out of my house, Cori!

392
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,875
ANGELA: Look, just let Cori do her job,
which is to plan the wedding.

393
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,428
Cori's job should be
to show a little respect.

394
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,671
I specifically told Cori,
I said, "No hydrangeas."

395
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,035
And what does she show up here with?
Hydrangeas!

396
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,519
I keep forgetting
that you're the bride.

397
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,558
Why does nobody want
to show me respect!

398
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,113
That's what
I wanna know, Ang.

399
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,879
Oh, I respect you.

400
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,718
Well, obviously not,
because we're sitting here

401
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,677
talking about
my passion and...

402
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Wow!

403
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,749
I respect that.

404
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,349
I do.

405
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,909
A lot.

406
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,798
Practice run for
the wedding night?

407
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,310
Yeah. I mean, we're here.

408
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,674
I'm taking you
into custody.

409
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,598
And we're going downtown.

410
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,115
Well, I like that.

411
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,752
Because of the play on words.
Uh-huh.

412
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,353
Yeah. What are you...

413
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,509
What is that?
What you trying to do?

414
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,834
No, stop. Don't do that.

415
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,275
No, no. Stop that. Stop.

416
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,874
You have the right
to stay silent...

417
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,757
You have the right
to "remain" silent...

418
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,274
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything...

419
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,839
Let me stop you right here, babe.
Just for a second.

420
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,473
Because I want
you to Mirandize me.

421
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,074
I want you to Mirandize
the hell out of me.

422
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,276
But first, what I need to do,
I need to go in that bathroom,

423
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,590
and wash all this
Atlanta crime off my butt.

424
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,433
Now, when I'm done, I'mma come
out clean and give myself to the law.

425
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,476
Take me.
Handcuff me to the bed.

426
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,595
Mmm-hmm.
All right.

427
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Babe, put that baton down

428
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,557
because if you break it,
I'mma have to pay for it.

429
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,119
Whoo. What is going on
in my stomach?

430
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,350
I gotta get in the bathroom.
(SIGHS)

431
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,515
Okay.

432
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,393
Hey, sis.
Everything okay?

433
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,959
I need you to do something for me,
for the wedding.

434
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,156
Look, if this is about me
not bringing a date...

435
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,231
That's not what I'm
calling you about.

436
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,393
I was wondering,
did you get me a gift for the wedding yet?

437
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,398
Sound like you
want a favor.

438
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,113
(BEN GRUNTS)
(SIGHS)

439
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,395
Ben really wants
to go to Miami.

440
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,879
He told me you
wouldn't take him.

441
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,269
Oh, hell, no. Are you crazy?
James,

442
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,480
it would mean
so much to him.

443
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,238
I don't care what
it'd mean to him.

444
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,639
Look, is this about him,

445
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,869
or is this about
you getting him

446
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,234
out of your hair
for a few days?

447
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,548
BEN: Ang!

448
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,709
A little bit of both.

449
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,835
No can do, sis.

450
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,512
Look, you get
the dwarf a sedative.

451
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,670
He's not going with me.
This is way too important.

452
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,160
But, James, he just wants to prove himself.
The answer is no.

453
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,595
(CALL DISCONNECTS)
Uh... Hello?

(CHUCKLES) This girl crazy.

455
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,233
Now, why would you want me
to take this little flea to Miami?

456
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,754
To show what kind
of a idiot he...

Someone's at the door.

All right.
They'll go away, Ang.

No, they're not. They're not going away.

I didn't break in.

At least, not this time.

What are you wearing?

Talking about
"what am I wearing?"

469
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,793
It's called a kimono, James.
They make them for men.

That's your problem.
You need to expand your horizons.

just please

don't bring this bullshit
to Miami with us.

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,390
You taking me to Miami?
I'm leaving in five minutes.

477
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,549
If you're going,
you better hurry up.

478
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,959
Come here, man.

479
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,314
All right.
No. It's too soon.

480
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,118
Baby steps.
I'm okay with that.

481
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,792
I knew you were
gonna change your mind.

482
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,869
Because when
we were talking,

483
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,269
you looked at me,
you were like...

484
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,833
And I was like, "He's thinking about it."
You were mulling it over.

485
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,956
God damn, I'm pumped up.

486
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,189
Oh!

487
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,993
Okay, this is
a little awkward, babe.

488
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
Uh...

489
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,996
James wants me to go away
with him for a couple days

490
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,911
on official police business.

491
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,160
(WHISPERING)
I don't wanna go.

492
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,509
I don't.
But James needs me.

493
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,760
ANGELA: Okay, yeah.
BEN: Okay?

494
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,751
Baby, do what you need to do.
Really?

495
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,717
Yeah. Just make sure
you're back in time

496
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,313
to make me Mrs. Black Hammer.

497
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,790
What? Yes! Stop it. Of course!
I can't wait to get back.

498
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,711
Because, as soon as I
get here, you and I,

499
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,600
we are gonna marry
the hell out of each other.

500
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,109
We're gonna marry our asses off.
(CHUCKLING) Okay.

501
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,269
Okay? Okay?
Give me three.

502
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
(KISSING NOISILY)

503
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,550
I love you.
I love you. All right. You!

504
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,549
Hey, what can I say?
You just... Miami! Oh.

505
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,076
Hurry up!
I'm hurrying.

506
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,990
Don't think I'm not grateful.
Mmm-hmm.

507
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,230
But why did you
change your mind?

508
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,629
Ben is never
gonna make Detective.

509
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,233
And everybody on
the force knows this.

510
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,869
But he thinks if he makes
this Miami run with me,

511
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,558
that he'll prove us
all wrong.

512
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,949
So, I'm taking him,
so he can see for himself.

513
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,476
Because I don't wanna hear him
complaining for the rest of my life

514
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,391
that I never
gave him a chance.

515
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,238
You never know, he may surprise you.
I doubt it.

516
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,992
He's done it before.
Beginner's luck.

517
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,230
Oh. Okay.

518
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,673
You'll be careful, right?

519
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,988
Don't worry.

520
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,399
I'll have your
little man-child

521
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,748
back here safe and sound.

522
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,154
Oh, he's all man.

523
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,639
BEN: Hey, Ang?
Yeah, babe?

524
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,960
BEN: You know
where my thong is?

525
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,189
The silver, or the gold?

526
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,680
BEN: I'm looking
for the silver one.

527
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,069
Check my top-right drawer.
Wow.

528
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,800
Don't mix up our thongs again, please.
I'm out.

529
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,599
BEN: Oh, I got them.
They were in my panty drawer, not yours.

530
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,238
Thank you.
ANGELA: You're welcome!

531
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Whoo! James!

532
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,869
Look at this, man!

533
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,279
James, do you see this?

534
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,510
This is Miami!
This is the 305!

535
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,198
Remember,
this ain't no vacation.

536
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,510
First thing we gonna do
is go by Miami PD.

537
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,789
Let them know we here.
Okay.

538
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,552
You can't just slide
into somebody's backyard,

539
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,712
start doing police work without
letting them know you in town.

540
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,870
If that's the case, then we gotta stop
somewhere, so I can change.

541
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,473
Why? What's the reason?

542
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,957
This is just wrong.

543
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,400
If linen is wrong, then I don't
wanna be right, James.

544
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,993
You look like
you're in a damn cult.

545
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,513
Does Tommy Bahama
run a cult?

546
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,232
If so, good,
and where can I sign up?

547
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,389
James, let me
tell you something.

548
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,596
If we're gonna be a team,
you gotta start to coordinate.

549
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,033
Listen to me, James!

550
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,872
We gotta complement
each other, all right?

551
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,916
I'm not trying to
compliment no marshmallow.

552
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,991
A good detective knows
how to blend in with the locals,

553
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,195
so his prey never
sees him coming.

554
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,833
Oh, yeah,
you blending, all right.

555
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,555
James, let me
tell you something,

556
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,914
the right gust of
wind hit this thing,

557
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,594
I'm giving you '90s P. Diddy.
Look at this, James.

558
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,429
All right.
Wait here.

559
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,589
Why I gotta wait here?

560
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,398
Why you gotta talk?

561
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,110
Detective,
I'm asking nicely.

562
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,350
Please, I need a suspect.

563
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,115
You're the Atlanta fella.

564
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,395
Captain Pedro Hernandez.
Honored to meet you.

565
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,953
Detective James Payton.

566
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,359
We just wanted to
give you a heads-up.

567
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,118
We're gonna be working
in your jurisdiction,

568
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,633
questioning
a possible witness.

569
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,199
HERNANDEZ: Thanks
for the heads-up.

570
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,709
(TYPING)

571
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,674
BEN: What? Hydrangeas?

572
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
Ugh.

573
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,477
(MEN LAUGHING AND APPLAUDING)

574
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,754
What's up with this?

575
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,920
It's the Antonio Pope
Foundation's annual fundraiser.

576
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,673
That's Antonio himself.

577
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,988
He's a big donor.

578
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,197
He owns one of the largest shipping
companies on the East Coast.

579
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,273
Oh! What is your problem?

580
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,429
You're at my desk.

581
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,073
I'm sorry. I was looking at some
floral arrangements.

582
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,594
Well, don't. Don't touch my computer.
Don't look at my computer.

583
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,795
This stuff is sensitive.

584
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,996
That is fine. I'll log out.
Oh, you're gonna log out?

585
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,639
Oh! Girl...

586
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,039
I said, don't touch!
Oh!

587
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,675
(GROANS)

588
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,228
It hurts, I know.
(GRUNTING) James? Oh!

589
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,956
Soft-tissue manipulation.

590
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,832
Pressure points.
(CONTINUES GRUNTING)

591
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,239
Come on, Ben, you should be able
to get out of that.

592
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,118
She got my appendix, James.
She locked this whole side up.

593
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,151
Can he get out of this?
(GROANING) Ooh!

594
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,912
(GRUNTING)
I don't know about that one.

595
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,671
Whoa! Come on, Ben.
You're embarrassing me.

596
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,949
Man up.
MAYA: Yeah, you're embarrassing him.

597
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,951
I tap out! I tap out!
You're pathetic.

598
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,031
Detective Payton,
Atlanta Vice.

599
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,078
Down here a couple
of days on assignment.

600
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,957
Oh, my hat!
Detective Cruz. Homicide.

601
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,713
And I'm Officer Ben Barber,
and I am his partner.

602
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,153
No, he's not.

603
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,680
I'm not shaking
your hand after that.

604
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,792
(OBJECTS CLATTERING)
Come on, James. Let's go.

605
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,155
Before I have to bust her ass.
Let's go.

606
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,840
Come on, James.
'Cause she's too much.

607
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,200
I don't know
what her problem is.

608
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,240
James, it's really cool
that you needed me

609
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,389
to come down here
and all, man.

610
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,072
But I feel bad,

611
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,040
because I know you had to
cancel all your plans.

612
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,155
What plans?

613
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,749
My bachelor party.

614
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,875
I didn't have
nothing planned.

615
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,554
Yeah, right.
Boy, if you don't stop...

616
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,112
Seriously, you didn't
have anything? Nothing?

617
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,959
James, I'm not even
into that. Strippers and...

618
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,508
I'm not trying to come home to the
Lady Hammer with glitter all on me.

619
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,669
I'm not... Come on.

620
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,432
Mmm-hmm.
Hey, on a more serious note,

621
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,431
Angela need to know who
you're bringing to the wedding, James.

622
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,593
Either Nicki Minaj
or Patti LaBelle.

623
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,600
You know what you're doing?
You're road-blocking.

624
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,392
That's what you're doing, man.
You're road-blocking.

625
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,993
You're still
holding onto something.

626
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
I know what it is.

627
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,953
You're afraid that when me and
Angela go sail off into the sunset,

628
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,473
that you're
gonna be by yourself.

629
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,549

You know why, James?
Because it's just banter.

Is that right?

It's a trademark of all great partnerships,
to be honest with you.

No, no. It's a trademark

What the hell's going on?

948
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,514
Well, I'll tell you what's not going on,
a Pilates class.

949
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,520
I dunno what you're dressed for,
but it's stupid.

950
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
What happened?

951
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,393
One shooter. Obviously a professional.
Went right after AJ.

952
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,515
Who the hell is AJ?

953
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,989
AJ's the hacker that we
came out here to question.

954
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,435
Now, your guys think
it's gang related.

955
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,794
I say that's bullshit.

956
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,518
Because you're
an expert on local gangs?

957
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,238
No, I'm an expert
on bullshit.

958
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,271
Well, expert,
how'd he get the gun in?

959
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
Gun was ceramic.

960
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,469
Or plastic. I saw it.
It was a FN 5.7.

961
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,430
It's undetectable. It's a downloadable
super pack in my video game.

962
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,830
Let me tell you something,
you get that pack, game over! Okay...

963
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,832
That's how he
got the gun in.

964
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,073
The case I'm
working on right now,

965
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,037
shooter got a gun
inside of a secured area.

966
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,348
And get this,

967
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,431
the threads on the bullet matched
the casings of an FN 5.7.

968
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,511
Same M.O. Could be
the same shooter.

969
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,198
Who was shot?
Port Commissioner.

970
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,120
Could be connected.
Could be connected.

971
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,112
Ugh. It's like
watching rams mate.

972
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,272
Why would somebody hire
a professional hitman

973
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,311
to take out a computer guy

974
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,152
for a mid-level
Atlanta dealer?

975
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,349
Because he's annoying.

976
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,079
If that was the case,
you'd be dead a long time ago.

977
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,200
I'm just spit-balling.

978
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,599
Fact is, he wouldn't.

979
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,999
So, the guy who hit
the Port Commissioner

980
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,714
is the same guy who
tried to hit your hacker.

981
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,791
Maybe he's involved
with something bigger.

982
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
You know what?

983
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,880
She should be your "plus one"
for the wedding.

984
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,560
You know what?
You should get in the car.

985
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,477
I need to get somebody for you.
You need to get in the car.

986
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,755
You wanna just have an empty plate there...
I'm getting in the car.

987
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,149
I'm not gonna keep doing this with you.
There's so much disrespect.

988
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,912
I mean, what's
funny to me, James...

989
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,991
The plastic gun,
I detected that.

990
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,593
But you don't say nothing
about that, do you?

991
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,000
A professional hitter
on a hacker?

No, you're not.

00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,678
Because this stinks.

out of the car.

No sign of him at the house.

1016

He's not going back to the house.
He's a wanted man.

Look, whoever's after AJ,
really needs to get to him.

00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,553
Not my brother.
Hey.

1098
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,358
That would be incest,
and that would be nasty.

1099
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,509
You're twisting stuff.

1100
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,795
You twist things because you
don't have the ability to love, James.

1101
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,880
That's your problem.

1102
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,518
I'll prove it to you right now.
Let me take the lead.

1103
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,312
I'll show you I could be a detective.
Hell, no.

1104
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,549
Tell me why.

1105
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,875
This girl's probably not even
gonna wanna talk to us in public,

1106
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,428
so it's not gonna be a good look
if you get all screechy,

1107
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,595
or you accidentally
shoot the girl.

1108
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,079
Why can't you let
the past be the past?

1109
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,240
You can't even handle Cori!

1110
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,639
She's irrelevant right now.

1111
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,676
The girl is the devil's
spawn with lady parts.

1112
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,955
Look, I'm taking the lead
because I'm the detective.

1113
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,314
Fine.

1114
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,955
It's like I'm
dealing with a child.

1115
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,272
BEN: Oh, my God.

1116
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,271
James, do you see this?
Yep.

1117
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,759
BEN: It's like
a Costco for supermodels.

1118
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,840
Look at this.

1119
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,195
James? Look up!
She's like a dolphin.

1120
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,633
Hey, stay focused.
I'm focused, James.

1121
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,188
At the same time, I'm not.
Look at this.

1122
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,354
(CLEARS THROAT)
Hello.

1123
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,037
Can I help you?
Yep.

1124
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,835
Where's Tasha?

1125
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,558
Um, okay,
just give me a second.

1126
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,113
I gotta get her
from the back.

1127
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,200
Tasha?
TASHA: Yeah?

1128
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,000
There's two police officers
here to see you.

1129
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,598
All right.
Thanks.

1130
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,829
Can I get anybody
a bottled water?

1131
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,354
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I'm about to get married.

1132
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,193
Oh.
I'm engaged right now, so...

1133
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,191
Didn't nobody ask you that.
I'm just letting her know.

1134
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,639
Okay, you can't put
a fish in the water

1135
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,790
if you don't
want him to swim.

1136
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,880
I don't know
where he is,

1137
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,558
and if I did
I wouldn't tell you.

1138
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,831
You will if you wanna
see him alive again.

1139
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,754
Now, AJ is in
way over his head

1140
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,040
and we just
trying to help him.

1141
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,314
And why
should I believe you?

1142
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,628
I didn't come here
to play with you.

1143
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,676
You think I'm gonna give up my man?
Oh, you're gonna give him up.

1144
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,155
Guaranteed, you're
gonna give him up... Nope, I'm not.

1145
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,355
BEN: Stop.
It's a little too much.

1146
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,555
Tasha...

1147
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,028
James may not understand
what you're saying, but I do.

1148
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,872
I mean, you and AJ
obviously have a connection,

1149
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,951
and you're trying to
honor him right now.

1150
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,268
Right, James?

1151
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,397
My question to everyone
standing here is,

1152
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,798
is he honoring
you, Tasha?

1153
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,518
Because when I went
through this phone, here...

1154
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,600
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1155
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,640
I was kinda thrown off

1156
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,517
by what was going on
in the contact list.

1157
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,919
Especially Favorites,

1158
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,355
because the first name I
came across was Colette.

1159
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,475
I said, "Who is Colette?"

1160
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,198
More importantly,
"What's her ringtone?"

1161
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,633
So I played it.

1162
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,558
(DIRTY SONG PLAYING)

1163
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,996
I don't know about you,
but that throws me off.

1164
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,274
'Cause it's hyper-sexual.

1165
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,588
What's that
relationship about?

1166
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,113
So I said, "Maybe
that's the only one."

1167
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,880
But then right underneath it,
I see "Bree."

1168
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,428
Bree? Yeah. Who is that?
What's her ringtone?

1169
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,794
So I played it.

1170
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,832
(EXPLICIT SONG PLAYING)
Ugh.

1171
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,520
James, do you hear that?

1172
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,033
Let me see.

1173
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,951
Yeah, he licking that
up and down, no doubt.

1174
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,680
James, that's a little graphic.
It's true.

1175
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,358
Well, disregard that.

1176
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,877
So, then I started
thinking about you.

1177
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,791
You're priority.
At least, I thought you were.

1178
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,200
But, then, I see your name
at the bottom of the list.

1179
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,396
So, I said, "Maybe he
saved the best for last."

1180
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,879
Then I played
your ringtone, Tasha.

1181
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,000
This is where it got dark.

1182

1183
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,879
Tasha, that's a Apple chime.

1184
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,471
That's a factory ringtone.
That costs absolutely nothing.

1185
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,150
That's the guy that
you wanna take up for?

For My Lady"?

I'm just asking.

1188
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,749
That is how you
talk to a woman.

1189
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,432
I got AJ's cell phone burner
number just like that.

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,880
And, here's the thing...

1191
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,516
Okay. When did we
start doing that?

1192
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,675
All right, Maya,
what you got?

1193

My guy Alonso's following a lead
on the explosives.

He said it's definitely
not from the States.

No, Ben got a number on AJ.

stole some money,

know from who.

when you find him.

to say the word "we"?

What's wrong with you?

saved to your phone already?

next to it?

out is what you're doing now?

than being focused.

all the male human parts?

AJ, your girlfriend told us
about the money you stole.

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

in on trying to kill me?

If I wanted to smoke you,
you'd be dead already.

to understand is

you got some

that your skinny ass can't take.

00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,914
I launder his money.

1405
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,116
You just admitted to about
four or five crimes right there.

1406
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,474
No, it's Fifth Amendment.

1407
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,788
A couple of days ago,

1408
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,270
I may have taken some money
from his account

1409
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,713
and put it into mine.

1410
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,835
BEN: You "may have"?
MAYA: What?

1411
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,876
I didn't think he'd notice.
Apparently, he did.

1412
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,949
Maya, what the
hell is that...

1413
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,308
Stop right there!

1414
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,880
Drop your gun, man!
You put it down!

1415
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,035
Drop it!
MAYA: Hold on!

1416
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,315
(SCREAMING)
AJ, stop screaming!

1417
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,400
I'll shoot your face!

1418
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,595
This is Alonso,
my explosives guy.

1419
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,160
I don't give a damn!
Put it down, now!

1420
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,310
Alonso, holster your weapon. They're cops.
JAMES: Don't do it, man.

1421
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,799
You better drop it!
Put your gun away.

1422
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,920
JAMES:
Put it down, Castro!

1423
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,029
Drop it!

1424
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,749
It's down, okay?
You put it down.

1425
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,717
Ben, we're good.
BEN: All right.

1426
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,277
(GRUNTS)
MAYA: What the hell?

1427
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,837
Again?
You've done this before?

1428
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,148
I don't know what to tell you, James!
(AJ WAILING)

1429
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,434
Okay, I'm on edge.
We're cop killers.

1430
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,748
My nerves is bad, man!

1431
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,751
I told you to focus!
You think I meant to do it!

1432
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,875
I thought he shot.

1433
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,279
You didn't shoot, so I shot!
(GASPING)

1434
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,910
Oh, my God!
He a zombie! Head shot!

1435
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,399
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

1436
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,118
Hold up! Hold up!
Hold up! (GUNSHOT)

1437
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,595
It's a vest!

1438
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,235
Idiots.

1439
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,519
It's a vest.

1440
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,030
That's why I need a vest, James.
Accidents like this.

1441
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,680
Who are these two fools,
and what are they doing in my house?

1442
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,988
They're the officers
from Atlanta.

1443
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,957
It was their car that exploded.
Hey, man.

1444
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,393
I'm Ben Barber.
I apologize.

1445
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,278
Hey, man. Cállate la boca.
What?

1446
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,636
Or I reach into your chest and
snatch out your midget heart.

1447
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,199
Okay, I came over
here to apologize.

1448
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,713
You shot me.
Well, I take it back.

1449
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,392
Take the sorry with you and leave!
Fine!

1450
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,789
Can we just stay focused?
Did you find anything out?

1451
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,234
The explosive from the car
and the detonator, both rare.

1452
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,514
Eastern-European,
actually.

1453
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,715
It's freaking Pope!

1454
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,835
Can you stop with that!

1455
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,717
Hold on, Maya. He could
be telling the truth.

1456
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,074
It would take someone
with serious reach

1457
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,991
to locate that kind of
untraceable device.

1458
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,631
You're gonna help me get
some hard evidence on him.

1459
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,517
Pope ain't gonna stop
shooting at your ass,

1460
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,953
so we the only
choice you got.

1461
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,429
You set up his
computer, right?

1462
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,714
So, can you
get us into it?

1463
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,960
Someone would need to
get to his home computer,

1464
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,070
and download
the shipping manifests.

1465
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,196
Well, Pope's having a party
at his mansion tonight.

1466
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,032
Security's gonna be tight.

1467
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,838
There's gonna be a lot of
foreign dignitaries there.

1468
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,069
No problem.

1469
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,718
We're gonna get in
there undetected,

1470
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,075
he's gonna let us know
where the computer is,

1471
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,673
and he gonna
talk us through.

1472
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,478
How do we get in undetected?

1473
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,680
Name?

1474
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,748
(IN GRUFF VOICE)
My name.

1475
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,589
My name.

1476
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,840
Prince Admiral
Steven Matumbe.

1477
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:20,748
Nigerian Consul.

1478
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,199
Plus two.

1479
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,633
My two servants.

1480
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,233
I don't have you
on the list.

1481
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,197
Then check the VIP list.

1482
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,350
And do not look me
in my eye.

1483
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,879
Don't look at me.

1484
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,110
You look at the pad,
you read the names.

1485
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,077
And you look at me,
and you close your eyes.

1486
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,434
Look at me.
Don't look at me.

1487
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,069
Look at me!

1488
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,752
That was a test.
You failed.

1489
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,274
You aren't on it.

1490
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,429
All right,
stall him, guys.

1491
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,389
AJ's on it.

1492
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,600
GUARD:
Step aside, por favor.

1493
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,075
Wait!

1494
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,593
This is all your fault.

1495
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,753
You know I do what
I am supposed to do.

1496
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,313
I clothe you,
I feed you,

1497
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,796
and yet your incompetence
furiates me.

1498
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,915
Sir.

1499
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,788
I'm your bodyguard,
not your servant.

1500
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,360
(GRUNTS)

1501
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,155
You are what I say you are!

1502
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,600
Oh, God.

1503
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,235
Sorry, sir.

1504
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,432
You got a fly on your face.

1505
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,520
Ooh.

1506
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,635
Traditional.
A sign of respect.

1507
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,560
AJ: Okay, try it now.
Check the list one more time.

1508
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,678
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)
There it is.

1509
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,518
Sorry about that.
Head right in.

1510
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,794
I will go.

1511
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,035
No, no, no!

1512
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,678
BEN: Release me!
This way.

1513
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,360
Where are we?
I cannot feel my face.

1514
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,473
And you're welcome.

1515
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,871
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1516
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,995
Hello.

1517
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,719
Remember, we're
on the defense.

1518
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,554
AJ is on the earpiece.

1519
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,359
All you gotta do is
download the file.

1520
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,994
You trust him
to do this?

1521
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,275
Of course not.
Do we have a choice?

1522
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,675
First of all,
Ben can hear you.

1523
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,080
Oh, James,
look at that!

1524
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,957
They got a Baccarat
diamond dolphin.

1525
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,917
Yeah, he probably got
a Gucci toilet, too.

1526
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,230
Do I look like I care? Stay on point.
Just walk.

1527
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,040
If he got a Gucci toilet,
I'm sitting on it.

1528
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,235
There he is.
AJ, can you hear us?

1529
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,548
AJ: Hey, is this
a passed-app event?

1530
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,517
Because I'd love
a wonton or two.

1531
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,033
It's not racist if I say it.

1532
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,189
Where are we going?

1533
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,271
First, you have to get
to the north hallway.

1534
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,920
It leads to
the other wing of the house.

1535
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,151
I'm gonna create
a distraction.

1536
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,232
You guys, act casual
until you see an opening.

1537
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,120
What you doing?
Put your hands down.

1538
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,355
I'm waving.

1539
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,032
Law enforcement is always
welcome at my functions.

1540
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,835
So, Mr. Pope,
do you dance?

1541
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,069
Do I dance?

1542
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,114
You're in for a treat.

1543
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,476
(LATIN DANCE-POP
MUSIC PLAYING)

1544
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,355
Are you dancing?
Yes.

1545
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,475
Well, stop.

1546
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,638
Okay, it worked.

1547
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,634
Let's get busy.

1548
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,837
He's really good, though.
I'm not sure... Let's go.

1549
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,313
Okay, Ben, go up the first set of stairs.
BEN: Roger that.

1550
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,311
And, proceed to
the end of the hallway.

1551
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,348
All right, James,
it's stealth mode time.

1552
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,436
Do you even know what
"stealth mode" mean?

1553
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,839
Yes, it's from
Assassin's Creed.

1554
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,069
It means to be
undetectable.

1555
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,037
The double doors to his
office are on the left.

1556
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,120
BEN: Okay.

1557
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,960
Tell me when you're there.
All right, AJ, this must be it right here.

1558
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,320
It's locked, AJ.
Okay, you know what?

01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,510
Guest bathroom is down the hallway.
We'll get in from there.

01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,079
Okay. Let's go, man.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)

1562
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,436
Go, go, go.
I got this.

1563
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,879
Hey, man.

1564
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,313
Did you see her?
See who?

1565
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,355
I think she went
down there.

1566
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,589
She said she was
gonna have my baby.

1567
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,954
No, man, you can't be up...
(RETCHING)

1568
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,234
Get downstairs.

1569
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,833
Use the bathroom downstairs.
Get down there.

1570
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,593
AJ: Okay, I need you
to go over to the window and open it.

1571
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:39,069
Okay, I see it.
I see it. I see it.

1572
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,469
Okay.
All right, it's open.

1573
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,993
Climb out.
I'm sorry, what?

1574
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,389
You heard me.
I said climb out.

1575
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,358
Uh, AJ, I'm two stories up.

1576
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,032
Look we're here now.
So own it.

nothing to me about

This has got a Spanish kick to it.
What kind of cheese is that?

1608
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,718
Manchego cheese.

that he had a alligator?

No. It's gator-free

gonna tell me that?

need-to-know information, AJ?

just get to the desk quietly.

I'm at the computer.
Guide me through it.

seven-digit code

that he inputted himself,
so I don't know it.

But I use my own personal code
on there, as well.

but it can keep you up all night.

01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:30,595
When are you going to let Ben
make his own mistakes, James?

1719
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,036
Yes, that's right.
I know your names.

1720
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:34,633
Does that surprise you?

1721
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,920
Perhaps the bigger
question is,

1722
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,878
why are the Atlanta police
crashing my party?

1723
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,350
Well, we thought that you
might have a problem with theft.

1724
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,199
Now that you
mention it, I did have

1725
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:48,271
an embezzlement
issue this week.

1726
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,749
Don't remember
reporting it, though.

1727
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,751
I'm guessing that you
found the culprit.

1728
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,909
Hmm?

1729
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,638
Oh, you douchebag.

1730
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,199
I think you know
who took from me.

1731
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,635
And if I don't get
some answers soon,

1732
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,676
a few of my city official
friends in Atlanta

1733
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,079
won't be
too happy to learn

1734
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,628
that one of their benefactors
is being harassed.

1735
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:07,073
In his own home,
no less.

1736
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,428
What, you gonna
snitch on us?

1737
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,669
Do you think we care?

1738
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,957
It is true that one of you
might just receive a reprimand.

1739
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,834
But what if one of you
is still on his probationary period?

1740
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,633
That particular officer,
he could be eliminated.

1741
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,677
Just like that.
BEN: Wait, wait, wait.

1742
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,671
I don't think we need to ruin
anybody's careers here.

1743
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,472
Especially with
the unemployment rate

1744
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:27,993
being so high
amongst blacks now.

1745
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,149
Tranquilo.

1746
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,679
I'm sorry, what?

1747
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,070
Listen, all I know is that I'm a
victim of a hacker who stole from me.

1748
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,394
I don't even want
to have him arrested.

1749
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,873
I just want to
figure out how he got in,

1750
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,560
so I can prevent it
from happening again.

1751
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,635
I'm worried that
my charities are vulnerable.

1752
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,391
So, if you are
not here to help,

1753
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:46,869
why did you come?

1754
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,393
I heard you had
a Gucci toilet.

1755
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,512
I think we're done here.

1756
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,473
My men will show you out.

1757
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,712
And the next time
you want to come

1758
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,995
to one of my parties,
just ask.

1759
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,759
Your parties suck.

1760
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,400
POPE: What went wrong?

1761
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,319
Now, I'm feeding
these people sliders,

1762
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,710
and having conversations
I don't want to be having?

1763
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,553
Take it easy. I'm not
going to shoot you.

1764
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,279
This is just a prop
to make my point.

1765
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,749
We are multi-national now.

1766
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,956
Any mistakes will
be way too costly.

1767
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,040
Hmm?

1768
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,598
No more
annoying conversations.

1769
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,158
No more excuses.

1770
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:33,398
Just get the job done.

1771
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,358
Sorry, Antonio.

1772
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,713
Definitely kill them.

1773
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,712
I just don't want to
get blood on my pants.

1774
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,681
Okay, I found a discussion
he tried to erase on his big solar project.

1775
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,354
Looks like Pope
orders his guy

1776
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,715
to delete certain shipments
from the manifest.

1777
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,836
But he specifically
tells that guy

1778
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,120
to leave other
shipments alone.

1779
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:59,310
Why would he wanna hide
shipments of solar panels?

1780
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,072
Because it's not
solar panels.

1781
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,800
He's got one of them hidden
shipments arriving tomorrow.

1782
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,518
JAMES: We need to find out
what's in that shipment.

1783
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,669
Wait.

1784
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,200
Does that mean
what I think it means?

1785
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,873
BEN: We are on a stakeout!

1786
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,474
Long-time dream achievement,
unlocked.

1787
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,840
You know, I think I
really proved myself this trip.

1788
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,350
And, I guarantee you, James,
that truck gonna be full of drugs.

1789
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,589
All right, man, slow down.

1790
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:23,639
If the Port Commissioner wasn't
cooperating, it could be a problem.

1791
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,994
One to kill for.

1792
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,958
He tried to cooperate,
but Pope still killed him anyway.

1793
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,676
How do you know that?
I was there, on Pope's yacht.

1794
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:31,994
When I told you to tell me
everything you know,

1795
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,991
why you didn't tell me
everything you knew?

1796
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,360
I didn't see anything,
all right?

1797
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,680
I was listening in
on his phone.

1798
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,432
Well, then, shut up
with all that hearsay.

01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,952
Is it my birthday?

1873
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,440
No!

1874
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,879
Okay, it must be Christmas!

1875
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:12,880
What we got?

1876
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,391
HERNANDEZ: Department's about
to get sued for harassment.

1877
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:21,914
And, I get to explain
to the new Port Commissioner,

1878
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,070
why we've made a mess
of his front yard!

1879
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,519
We had good intel.

1880
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,909
It was an unregistered,
off-the-books shipment.

1881
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,479
It was a clerical error.

1882
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,676
I really don't understand

1883
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,079
what I gotta do
to get off

1884
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,469
whatever shit list
I seem to be on, here.

1885
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,358
Mr. Pope,
let me apologize.

1886
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,239
See, I don't get it.

1887
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,080
I've tried to be nice.
I've tried to be cool.

1888
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:45,357
Did I press charges when you
three crashed my party? No.

1889
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:46,880
But, now...

1890
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,434
See, now, I'm pissed.

1891
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,074
I have a reputation
to protect.

1892
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,915
This is gonna
come out weird,

1893
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,992
but I'm really,
really rich.

1894
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,752
I mean, I make
sick money.

1895
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,308
And, do you know what
that money buys me?

1896
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,440
Hmm?

1897
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,509
Access.

1898
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,473
So, you can imagine

1899
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,028
that I have already
begun to make calls

1900
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,838
up the chain of command.

1901
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,918
So, James, it looks to me
like your training day is officially over.

1902
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,833
But hey, good luck on
your future careers,

1903
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,633

1905
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:32,829
Can I have a word?

1906
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,434
HERNANDEZ: You, come with me.

1907
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:40,036
You can help me explain this mess
to the new commissioner.

1908
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,155
Shit.

1909
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,469
Ouch.

1910
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,113
That went really badly.

1911
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,034
It's kind of hard to
think of any outcome

1912
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,752
that's gonna be worse
than that, right there.

01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,720
Hello?

1916
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,109
Milk run, huh? I'm gonna assume you've
been chewed out already,

1917
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,553
so I'm gonna save my voice.

1918
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,790
James, we're talking about
a lengthy suspension.

1919
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:05,438
Ben, you're
still probationary,

1920
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:06,509
so there's really no choice.

1921
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,716
Wait, Lieutenant Brooks.
Hold on, now.

1922
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,199
There'll be a hearing,
but it's just a formality.

1923
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,759
You're done as a cop, Ben.

1924
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:12,840
Like "done," done?

1925
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,514
Lieutenant, you don't wanna hear
my side of the story?

1926
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,920
No! Just get your
asses back here!

1927
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,035
Please, don't do this.

1928
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,429
You did this!
You and James!

What the hell
did we miss?

1932
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,952
I know that shipment ain't
nothing but a front to move coke.

1933
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,873
Yeah, but the containers
was empty, James.

1934
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,555
Maybe the container
was made of coke.

1935
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,188
I'll put a pin in that.

just went pear-shaped.

we missed bad, Ang.

I lost my job,

but then I started
thinking like,

"No, just wait till
you get home, because..."

Hey, guys.

1961
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,430
I was just thinking about
the Port Commissioner's replacement.

1962
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,750
It's weird how he showed up
on the bridge right after Pope.

1963
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:49,840
So?

1964

You don't kill
the Port Commissioner

1965
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,078
if you don't control
the replacement.

Makes sense.

Got that Taylor Swift song
you wanted, player.

1969
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,476
Look, if Nuñez is in on it,

1970
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,199
that means Pope is moving
contraband through the port.

1971
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,157
Nuñez? Charlie Nuñez?

1972
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:11,508
That was one of the names on Pope's
payroll report on his computer. (CHUCKLES)

1973
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,200
Was that important?

on his computer,

let us find that container,
got us to prove his innocence,

1977
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,438
so that the other containers
could skate through.

1982
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,957
I should have put that together.
Can I talk to you?

1983
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,314
Okay. James?

1984
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,392
Look, I knew
about the containers,

1985
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,118
but my thing is,
I didn't think further than that.

And, that's where
I went wrong.

Stop, stop.

You don't have to say it.
I already know what you're gonna say.

Listen, man, I just
brought you over here

1990

to tell you,
you're not going.

What are you talking about?

1992
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,998
I am going.
No, you're not.

You know what, James?

1996
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,034
I've been out here
putting my life on the line,

1997
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,951
to prove to you that
I can be a detective.

1998
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,793
I don't know what your real problem is,
James, but this is what I wanna...

1999
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,915
Listen!

you can end up in jail.

2002
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:11,954
Or worse.

2003
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,509
You can end up dead.

2004

BEN: What... Oh.

2005
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,240
I'm sorry, Ben,
but this is for your own good.

2006
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,276
Okay, look, they're not gonna let us
within a mile of the port.

2007
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,475
We gotta take
a boat and head north.

2008
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,278

James! Hey, stop!

2009

2010
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,278
I'll tell you
how it goes.

just let you take out

2018
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,392
Hey, don't shoot me, man!

2019
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,311
Ain't nobody gonna shoot you.
Show me your hands!

2020
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:03,913
Man, stop it! Come on, get up.
I need your help.

2021
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,109

2022
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,958
(INAUDIBLE)

2023
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,912

I need you to hide.

01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:53,600
What do you wanna do?

2026
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,680

take him down?

Wow. (STAMMERING)

2028
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,433
That's a bit aggressive.

2029
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,829
I think there's a different way
we could do this.

2030
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,790
Hey, man, do you know
where South Beach is?

2031
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:18,279
'Cause my GPS ain't
working worth a...

2032
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,669
(GRUNTING)
That is pretty impressive.

2033
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,751
Wanna give it a try?
Can I get him under here?

2034
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:23,840
Yeah, now twist.

2035
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,120
(GRUNTING)

2036
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,269
Right?
Oh! Yeah.

2037
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:27,554
You know,
I gotta do this on Ben.

2038
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,440
Let me show you how we do it in
the A, though.

2039
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,595
Yeah. Well,
that works, too.

2040
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,120
We got him.

2041
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,752
Send a car over to
pick up Pope's ass.

2042
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,840
POPE: I'm already here.

2043
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,200
Freeze!

2044
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:51,276
As a matter of fact,
I'm everywhere.

2045
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,114
Psst! God! You scared
the shit out of me.

2046
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,952
Hey, how'd you get out of...
Don't worry about it.

2047
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:01,268
Where's James and Maya at?

2048
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,759
Checking a container
somewhere over there.

2049
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,273
The container yard.

2050
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:06,157
This is classic boss level.

2051
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,276
Something always goes down
in the container yard.

2052
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:09,908
And it's not just cocaine.

2053
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:12,474
I'm opening a contraband
super highway.

2054
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,870
Guns, drugs, freaking
whale meat. Whatever.

2055
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,390
I think there's even a pygmy
giraffe in one of these.

2056
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,480
Fun.

2057
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,190
I had to come down
to see it for myself.

2058
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,032
And, look what I find.

2059
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,600
BEN: Shit, Pope's got them.

2060
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,440
You stay here.
I got an idea.

2061
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:37,600
(CHUCKLING)

2062
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,357
You look discouraged.

2063
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,312
I feel bad
for you guys.

2064
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,551
It's like when my nephew
loses a soccer game. I wanna...

2065
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,234
I wanna give you
a hug and a Capri Sun.

2066
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,794
But I feel worse
for these guys.

2067
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:51,916
I mean, they have to kill
two rogue cops

2068
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,712
who they mistook
for terrorists.

2069
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,594
Uncool. They have
to live with that.

2070
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,759
I have a better idea.

2071
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:06,553
How about having a professional
take care of it, hmm?

2072
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:11,515
Ben Barber, bitches!

2073
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:19,072
BEN: Hold up, James!
Now, I got it!

2074
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,395
Yeah!

2075
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:29,314
(GRUNTING)

2076
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:30,435
Did I do that?

2077
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,360
Oh, shit!

2078
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,360
(GRUNTING)

2079
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,280
Oh, shit!

2080
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,160
Help!

2081
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,239
Backup! I need backup!

2082
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,432
Help! Help!

2083
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,078
Hey! Hurt Locker!

2084
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:51,440
Oh, God!

2085
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,760
(GROANS)

2086
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:00,633
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

2087
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,520
(GRUNTS)

2088
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,080
(GRUNTS)

2089
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:18,434
Maya, down!

2090
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,838
You're welcome.
Let's go.

2091
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:29,311
You have been
a real nuisance.

2092
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:33,148
I swear,
I'm a double-secret-spy.

2093
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,878
I volunteered to infiltrate
myself in the crew.

2094
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,040
(SCREAMS)

2095
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:46,680
Shit.

2096
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,431
Ah! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I won't do it again!

2097
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,520
(GRUNTS)

2098
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:09,355
Look!

2099
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,995
Here we go!

2100
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,360
(SCREAMING)

2101
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:29,959
Oh, shit!

2102
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,389
Come on, Ben!

2103
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,435
Oh, I got you now.

2104
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:53,635
(LAUGHS)

2105
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,754
Take this, Pope!

2106
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:56,960
(TIRES SCREECHING)

2107
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:14,875
All right, Pope!

2108
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,435
It's over!

2109
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:17,754
Let me see them hands!

2110
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,393
Out the cab, now!

2111
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,113
Get out, Pope! I will...

2112
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,437
It's clear!
POPE: Oye, chicos.

2113
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:26,873
Are you looking
for something?

2114
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,109
Put the gun down, please.

2115
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,033
Put down your weapons, now!

2116
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,558
Now, this is the part
where I needlessly

2117
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:41,313
tell you that you are going to die.
Blah, blah, blah.

2118
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,229
But, of course,
you already know that.

2119
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:47,480
So, which one of you
would like to go first, hmm?

2120
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:51,113
James, let's start with you.

2121
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:52,800
(SCREAMING)

2122
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:03,875
Ben!

2123
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:05,314
Why'd you
do that, man?

2124
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,479
You're always trying some
Assassin's Creed, Call of Duty stuff.

2125
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:12,480
Got on a vest.

2126
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,632
You got on a vest?
(GROANS)

2127
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:17,160
BEN: See that?

2128
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,919
We protect each other, James.

2129
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,069
I don't know about that.

2130
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:21,798
Technically, you got a vest on.
I know.

2131
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,836
I definitely
saved your life, man.

2132
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,638
(CHUCKLES)
Don't go too far, now.

2133
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,278
He could've shot me
in the damn head, James.

2134
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:28,400
He didn't!

2135
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,675
Maya, did I save his life?
Maybe a little.

2136
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:31,795
Thank you.

2137
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:40,520
(GUNSHOT)

2138
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,035
James!

2139
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,354
MAYA: It's clear!

2140
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:58,635
JAMES: You know what?

2141
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:00,240
You might have
saved my life that time.

2142
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:01,548
(HOARSELY)
I'm telling Angela.

2143
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,039
Come on, walk it off.

2144
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,189
I can't walk.

2145
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,280
Rub some dirt on it.

2146
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,351
I'm not puttin' no dirt
on no bullet holes!

2147
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,914
Hey, man, we the brothers-in-law!
Not anymore.

2148
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,109
Offer is
off the table.

2149
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:17,950
No brother-in-law of mine
would do that to me.

2150
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,557
You tried to kill me.

2151
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:24,552
HERNANDEZ: You took down a drug-dealer
and a crooked politician in three days.

2152
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:26,312
I'm impressed.
I know.

2153
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,800
That's how we do
it in Atlanta, Cap.

2154
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:28,995
It's a pleasure.

2155
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,274
Thanks, Captain.

2156
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,475
Thanks for
everything, Cap.

2157
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:32,560
Good luck, guys.

2158
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:35,392
Okay, look, we got eight hours
to make it back.

2159
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:37,471
James, the only way we're going
to make it back is by plane.

2160
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:38,675
Do I look like a bird?

2161
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:39,715
James, stop, man,
I'm serious.

2162
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:41,153
That's the only way
we're going to make it back.

2163
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:42,240
I don't fly.

2164
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:43,469
This is my wedding, James.

2165
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,600
Hey!

2166
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:48,160
After all that, you guys were gonna leave
without saying anything?

2167
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,434
Nah, we was actually trying to figure
out how we was gonna get back.

2168
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,714
Figured that.

2169
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,153
So I got you something.

2170
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,599
It's one of
Pope's cars.

2171
01:31:58,280 --> 01:31:59,679
Oh, my God!

2172
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,835
Oh! Let me have it.

2173
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:02,114
James!
It's nice.

2174
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,635
MAYA: Bring it back with no bullet holes.
BEN: Oh, man!

2175
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:08,395
James! You gotta make her
your "plus one," James!

2176
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:10,909
Ask her how to open it.
I don't see the handle.

2177
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,195
You've got to
let me drive this!

2178
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,153
So, um...
Sure.

2179
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:16,600
Huh?

2180
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,197
You were inviting me
to the wedding, right?

2181
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:22,554
I guess so.

2182
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,636
I answered too quick, didn't I?
When I said, "Sure"?

2183
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:25,755
It's okay.

2184
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,991
I was waiting for you to...
But I thought that you...

2185
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,798
