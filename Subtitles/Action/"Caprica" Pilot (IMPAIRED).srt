Her biggest concerns in life
were partying with her friends

638
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:27,473
The way?

639
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,807
There is good and there
is evil in this world.

640
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,214
There is a right
and there is a wrong,

641
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,983
but only through the one true
God can we know the difference.

642
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:41,549
And Zoe knew.
Because Zoe knew God,

643
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,724
and God touched her heart,

644
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,422
and gave her
the ability to create

645
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,127
life itself.

646
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,086
ZOE: Why did you
bring him here?

647
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,851
He needs you, Zo.

648
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,098
Hi, Daddy.

649
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:32,372
ZOE: I thought that was you
at the club yesterday.

650
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,937
Thought I got away
before you saw me.

651
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:39,275
Guess I wouldn't make
a very good spy.

652
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:44,445
You're an avatar, a virtual
representation of Zoe.

653
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:47,884
Nothing more.

654
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,516
I'm a little more
than that.

655
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,785
A lot more, actually.

656
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,928
I'm sort of her.

657
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,601
Crazy as that sounds,

658
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:02,530
I am her.

659
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,035
I'm Zoe Graystone.

660
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,342
Zoe is dead.

661
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,106
I know,

662
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,046
and I'm so sorry
about that,

663
00:44:14,718 --> 00:44:16,583
more than you can know.

664
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:21,451
She was like...
Like my twin sister.

665
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,388
No, that's not right, either.
She was more than that.

666
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:32,334
We were like
echoes of one another.

667
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,663
It's hard to describe.

668
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,970
(STAMMERING) So,
what is this, really?

669
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:43,312
Did Zoe hack some kind of rudimentary
emulation software or something?

670
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,211
She said it was a combination
of hacks and some...

671
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,910
Okay, that's enough.
What was the purpose of this thing?

672
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,009
I'm not a thing.

673
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:51,554
I'm not going to argue
with a digital image.

674
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:56,218
The human brain contains roughly
300 megabytes of information.

675
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,654
Not much, when you get
right down to it.

676
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:03,258
The question isn't how to store it.
It's how to access it.

677
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,063
You can't download
a personality.

678
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,229
There's no way
to translate the data.

679
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,398
But the information
being held in our heads

680
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:14,171
is available
in other databases.

681
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:18,610
People leave more than footprints
as they travel through life.

682
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:22,585
Medical scans, DNA profiles,
psych evaluations,

683
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:26,749
school records, e-mails,
recording videolaudio,

684
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,348
CAT scans,
genetic typing,

685
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,450
synaptic records,
security cameras,

686
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,290
test results,
shopping records,

687
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,330
talent shows, ball games,

688
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,423

689

690
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,393
movie tickets, TV shows.

691
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,839
Even prescriptions
for birth control.

692
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:01,456
You do not tell the Guatrau you
need time to think about anything.

693
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:04,551
You say, "Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
May I have another?"

694
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,960
You swore allegiance
to him, Sam. Not me.

695
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,966
You have no problem
taking his cubits.

696
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,892
I don't care if he put me
through law school or not.

697
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,165
I'm tired of doing
his dirty work for him.

698
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,031
You just fire me
if you don't like it.

699
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:23,709
You of all people should know that the
Ha'la'tha does not fire people, Joseph.

700
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:26,043
They bury them.

701
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:32,944
<i>ZOE: Yeah.</i>

702
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:34,885
I remember that.

703
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,653
You put me up on your shoulders so I
could see the band as it marched by,

704
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:43,191
but we were standing
under a lamppost,

705
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,325
(LAUGHS)

706
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:47,859
and I smacked my head
so hard I saw stars.

707
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:52,103
Took you to the emergency
room just as a precaution.

708
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,176
I hated that.
- Yeah.

709
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:57,240
The lights
and the doctors

710
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,573
and that smell.

711
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,518
But I remember you holding
my hand the whole time.

712
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,417
You said you
wouldn't let go.

713
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,592
She could've programmed
those memories into you.

714
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,363
But it is a lot of detail
for such a minor event.

715
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,403
It's possible she
could've found a way

716
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,168
to translate synaptic
records into usable data.

717
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,401
She did.

718
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:29,206
Yes, but a person
is much more than just

719
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:32,510
a bunch of usable data.

720
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,984
You might be
a good imitation,

721
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,917
you might be
a very good imitation,

722
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,080
but you're still
just an imitation.

723
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:40,416
A copy.

724
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,823
I don't feel like a copy.

726
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,238

727
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:03,143
May I hold you, Zoe?

doing to her?

Stop it, Dr. Graystone! Stop!

What did you do to her?

731
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,823
I captured the code Zoe
used to create the avatar.

732
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,869
Why?
- It's time for you to leave.

00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:26,726
Sister Clarice,
you wanted to see me?

739
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,265
Lacy, I'd like you
to meet Agent Duram.

740
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,096
Hello, Miss Rand.

741
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:36,196
Agent Duram has a few
questions he wants to ask.

742
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,835
Lacy, why don't
you have a seat?

743
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:51,310
I understand you were
friends with Ben Stark.

744
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,382
Sure. I knew Ben.

745
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:58,287
We have evidence to suggest that he
was involved in the attack on the lev.

746
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:01,921
That's crazy.

747
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:05,635
I have to agree with Lacy.
That's an absurd allegation, Mr. Duram.

748
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:09,001
I'm afraid we have forensic
evidence linking him to the bombing.

749
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,965
Were you aware of his involvement
with the Soldiers of the One?

750
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,238
CLARICE: Ben Stark was
a good and decent boy.

751
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:20,011
He would never be involved with some kind of a...
Of a terrorist organization.

752
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:23,018
Lacy, did you know
that Ben was involved?

753
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,553
No, and I don't believe it.

Were you aware that
she was a member

of Soldiers of the One,
as well?

She's just gone through an
incredibly traumatic event.

759
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:53,907
Where does the
Athenian Academy stand

760
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,975
on the question of
monotheism, Sister?

761
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,146
Are we under
investigation now?

00:50:58,455 --> 00:50:59,820
Just a question.

763
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:05,117
The Academy is dedicated to
following the path of the Gods,

764
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,095
the Goddess Athena
being our patroness.

765
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,997
We are, however, open
to all forms of worship,

766
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,461
including belief
in a singular God.

767
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,800
That's very tolerant.

768
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:18,139
And how many of your students
are practicing monotheists?

I can't answer that.

concern you, Sister,

00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:53,969
I know who you are,
Mr. Jenkins.

796
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:56,096
So, how do you think
we did tonight?

797
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,299
Not that great.

798
00:52:57,374 --> 00:53:00,343
(LAUGHS) Keep it positive.
You're among champions here, pal.

799
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,607
I'd like to speak with your father if
you don't mind hanging out with the team.

800
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,170
Is that okay?
- Sure.

801
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,716
This is Sean. If you want something,
anything, you just ask him.

802
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:08,910
Okay.

803
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,816
Now, you behave, Son.
- Okay, Dad.

804
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:12,650
You know,
that was the first time

805
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:14,849
I've seen him really light up
since the accident,

806
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:17,792
so thank you so much
for doing this.

807
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,227
Please, please,
it's easy.

808
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:22,629
And you?

809
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,062
How are you holding up?

810
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,469
You know us Taurons.

811
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,472
We're nothing
if not a stoic people.

812
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,506
(CHUCKLES)

813
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:41,042
Do you mind if I ask you a somewhat
strange and personal question?

814
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:49,353
What would you do if you had the
chance to be with your daughter again?

815
00:53:58,268 --> 00:53:59,599
You don't have to answer that.
I'm sorry.

816
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,136
No, no.

817
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:02,262
It was
a personal question.

818
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,204
I just hadn't
thought about it.

819
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:15,344
Most of my family, including my parents,
died in the Tauron civil war,

820
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,712
so my brother and I
came here as orphans.

821
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:22,391
When we arrived,
they drove us to this orphanage.

822
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:26,956
I remember this field of
wildflowers on the side of the road.

823
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:31,966
It might seem strange to a Caprican,
but there are no flowers on Tauron.

824
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:34,497
Not one.

825
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:38,807
It was the most beautiful
thing I'd ever seen in my life.

826
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,308
All the colors,

827
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,805
the petals,
the softness, and

828
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,117
I wept openly,

829
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,986
for the first
and last time.

830
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:58,692
So I guess that's
what I'd tell Tamara,

831
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:02,626
to find those things in life
that make you cry,

832
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,332
that make you feel.

833
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,996
Because they're what
make you human.

834
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,767
I guess that's what
I'd tell Tamara

835
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,004
if I could.

836
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,419
Wow.

837
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:32,661
William, I'm guessing you'd
like to see the game room, yes?

838
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,789
Yeah.
- Serge?

839
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:35,888
Go have fun.
SERGE: <i>Yes, Daniel?</i>

840
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,728
Please escort William
down to the game room.

841
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,132
Show him how to use
the equipment.

842
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:40,794
<i>Right this way, William.</i>

843
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,809
It's quite a place
you got here.

844
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:51,210
I still miss tinkering down in
my parents' basement, you know?

845
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:52,976
This all seems
a bit much.

846
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,827
Ever tried one of these?

847
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:12,628
Uh...

848
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,699
I'm not much
for that stuff.

849
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,297
Indulge me, please.

850
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,634
Sure.

851
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,042
Just step right in here,

852
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:24,944
if you would. Right there.

853
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,645
This is what happens
when you buy a Holoband

854
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,184
at any retail store.

855
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:30,412
I saw it on the news.

856
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:34,423
Basically, I'm going to scan
your image for your avatar,

857
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,691
which is, in essence, a
virtual copy of you, physically.

858
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,389
Now, just stand still.
- Okay.

859
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:44,160
You're gonna feel a slight
tingling sensation in your skin,

860
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,668
but I assure you,
it's not harmful.

861
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:58,136
You can step out now.

862
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:00,972
There you are.

863
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:03,142
I've looked better.

864
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,119
If you will
just sit here,

865
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,713
we are ready to go.

866
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:11,827
Now, just relax,
close your eyes.

867
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:15,426
Remember, it's going
to seem real,

868
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:19,264
very real,
but it's all virtual.

869
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,201
Just an illusion.

870
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,399
Okay.

871
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,383
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

872
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,183
It takes getting used to.

873
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:45,856
Can I talk?

874
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,359
I guess I can.
Where are we?

875
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:53,392
Inside a very basic
computer program.

876
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,837
I haven't had time to do any
decorating yet. Step over here.

877
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,503
Just tell yourself to walk.

878
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:16,153
What are you
doing, Daddy?

879
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:18,558
Working.

880
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:21,796
Joseph,

881
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,398
this is Zoe,

882
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:28,434
my daughter.

883
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,545
My Gods.

884
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,482
(GASPS)
Boo.

885
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:50,250
Frak!

886
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,119
(JOSEPH GRUNTS)

887
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,856
What the hell is this?

888
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,261
What kind of sick, twisted
thing are you doing here?

889
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:56,593
There's nothing
twisted about it.

890
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,395
And I didn't do it.
Zoe did.

891
00:58:58,468 --> 00:58:59,526
Zoe did?

892
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:02,867
Turns out she was kind of
a chip off the old block.

893
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,167
That's not her.

894
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,936
Our daughters, they're gone.
- Yes.

895
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,170
You know this.

896
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:12,010
Yes, but what if
they could come back?

897
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,073
You're insane.

898
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:15,549
Do you know what
your brain is, Joseph?

899
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:17,313
It's a database and a
processor, that's all.

900
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,753
Information and
a way to use it.

901
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:21,050
And what my daughter
figured out was...

902
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:23,149
Was how to harness
all the information

903
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,989
that made her
who and what she was.

904
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,323
It's genius, really.

905
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,695
She took a search engine and
turned it into a way to cheat death.

906
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:32,428
No, it's... It's an illusion.
You said so yourself.

907
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:34,595
Yes. You're right.
You're right. She's a copy.

908
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:38,266
But she's a perfect copy
in every way.

909
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:39,672
Still doesn't make her
your daughter.

910
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:40,800
There's an axiom
in my business,

911
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:44,108
"A difference that makes no
difference, is no difference."

912
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,172
She looks like Zoe,
she talks like Zoe, she thinks like Zoe,

913
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,774
remembers all the events
of her childhood,

914
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:52,912
has all the same likes, dislikes,
flaws, strengths, all of it.

915
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:56,086
Who's to say her soul
wasn't copied, too?

916
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,592
You can't copy a soul.

917
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,025
And you would
know that how?

918
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:02,030
Hmm? How can you prove
or disprove that idea?

919
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,396
Look, I know
what I know, okay?

920
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:05,900
And I know you can't
copy a person.

921
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,561
I know that
she's my daughter.

922
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:09,935
I know that
she is my daughter,

923
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,104
and I know it in the only
place that matters. Here.

924
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:17,404
The only difference between her and the
Zoe that lived in this house is just that.

925
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,779
She lived in this house
instead of a virtual world.

926
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:23,216
I want to bring her here.

927
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,983
Joseph, I want her to live
in this world once more.

928
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:30,184
I want to hold her in my arms,
and I want to kiss her,

929
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:33,251
and I want her to feel
the sun shine on her face.

930
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,730
I want her to see the flowers
at the side of the road, Joseph.

931
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:43,396
But for me to be able to transfer
the virtual representation of Zoe

932
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:46,465
you just saw in there into
a physical body out here,

933
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:50,103
I need a very special, very
particular piece of equipment.

934
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,476
A physical body... What do you mean?
- Yes.

935
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:52,775
Like a robot?

936
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:55,317
"Robot" is a crude name
for what we're talking about.

937
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:56,477
This is a cybernetic
life-form node.

938
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:57,814
It's still a machine!

939
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:00,412
It's artificial skin, eyes, hair, make-up.
- It's cold. It's dead. It's...

940
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,219
Yes, but these are
surface details.

941
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:04,384
That's what we always tell
our children, isn't it?

942
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:06,394
What matters
is on the inside.

943
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:11,263
The device that I need is called
a Meta-Cognitive Processor.

944
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:15,703
The problem is, there's only
one company that has this device,

945
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,262
and it's not mine.

946
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,432
Okay.

947
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:21,800
The only one in existence is
owned by the Vergis Corporation.

948
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,740
Ever heard of them?
- Yeah, sure.

949
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:31,285
I know your connection
to the Ha'la'tha.

950
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,312
I know who
and what you are.

951
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,916
I also know about the
pit in your stomach.

952
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:39,393
I know about the
sleepless nights.

953
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:41,054
I know about the
wishing and praying

954
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,327
to whatever Gods will listen that you
could have everything back the way it was.

955
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,766
Well, I can bring
Tamara back.

956
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:48,326
I can bring her back.
- Get out of my way.

957
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:49,701
You can see
your daughter again.

958
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:51,865
Isn't that worth whatever
price you have to pay?

959
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:54,171
If you leave now,
you'll never know for sure.

960
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:57,371
You'll always wonder.
You'll walk by her room,

961
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,210
you'll see her pictures
on the wall,

962
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:02,080
and you'll ask yourself every
day for the rest of your life

963
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,984
whether you had a chance
to bring her back.

964
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,723
Now, if I'm wrong,

965
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,850
have me beat up, have me killed.
I don't care.

966
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:13,157
But if I'm right...

967
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:19,424
(SIGHING) If I'm right and you have
a chance to see your daughter again,

968
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:22,929
possibly even your wife,

969
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,811
isn't it worth trying?

970
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:52,999
Good morning.

971
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:56,463
Hey.

972
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:00,904
Morning.

973
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:03,644
What's this?

974
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,644
I made you breakfast.

975
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,715
You made breakfast?

976
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:11,213
Excuse me.
I used to cook for you all the time.

977
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,754
Eggs  la Graystone,
wild-mushroom sausage,

978
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:20,262
rosemary bread and, of
course, your black tea.

979
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:24,494
Enjoy.

980
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,095
I miss you.

981
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,575
We can make it
through this.

982
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:43,477
We can.

983
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:46,982
Together.

984
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,890
Just the two of us.

985
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:53,154
Yeah.

986
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:04,636
Thank you.

987
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:13,172
Eat, and maybe later on, I'll give you
a chance to lose to me in straight sets.

988
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,614
JOSEPH: I need
a favor, Sam.

989
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:24,486
I don't even know
if it can be done,

990
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,525
but I need
something stolen.

991
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:28,788
(CHUCKLING)

992
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,332
Really? You?

993
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:36,532
I'm listening.
- From the Vergis Corporation.

994
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:38,005
On Tauron.

995
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,772
Tomas Vergis is a good
friend of the Guatrau's.

996
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:45,546
I doubt he'd sanction
stealing from a friend.

997
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:48,049
What if I agreed to deliver
the message he wanted

998
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,879
to Minister Chambers?

999
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,480
Isn't this one of those
big lines of yours

1000
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:56,218
you're always so worried
about crossing, Joseph?

1001
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,487
Are you sure you really
want to do that?

1002
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,068
You're not actually
threatening me, are you?

1003
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:11,732
Minister Chambers,
I'm simply delivering a message.

1004
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:15,601
There's no threat, real or implied,
in anything I've told you.

1005
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,076
(LAUGHING)

1006
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:23,045
You Taurons, you've got stones,
I'll give you that.

1007
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,246
Are you making
a racial comment, sir?

1008
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,653
No more than
you're making a threat.

1009
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:31,149
Let's be clear.

1010
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:34,292
I don't like your boss,

1011
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,892
I don't like your planet
and I don't like your people,

1012
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:41,834
so you crawl under that rock
where your Guatrau lives,

1013
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:45,932
and you tell him that not only will
I not be pressured or blackmailed,

1014
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:50,411
but the government of Caprica is going
to take a very special interest in him,

1015
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,003
his business

1016
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,507
and his low-life lawyers.

1017
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:01,419
Perhaps you should
sleep on it.

1018
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,981
Deliver the message,
errand boy,

1019
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:06,888
word for word.

1020
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:16,196
Goodbye, Minister Chambers.
Have a safe journey.

1021
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:21,233
I'm not going anyplace,
you frakking dirt-eater.

1022
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:15,684

1031
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:39,605
Hey there, you.

1032
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:41,775
Always in the books.

1033
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,002
Missed you
at the club last night.

1034
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:47,243
Missed you
for two hours.

1035
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:48,544
Sorry.

1036
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:51,177
I haven't been much of
a friend lately, have I?

1037
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,751
That's fine.
It doesn't matter.

1038
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:58,619
Look,

1039
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:00,659
I found something.

1040
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:05,091
It changed my life.
I want to share it with you.

1041
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:06,694
Changed your life?

1042
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:07,997
Sounds stupid, huh?

1043
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:11,938
Look, it's not.
It's real.

1044
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:14,733
Come with us.

1045
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:15,868
To what?

1046
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:17,301
A prayer meeting.

1047
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,403
Because I don't go
to enough of those.

1048
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,538
This one is different.

1049
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:20,946
You pray, Lace,

1050
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:24,148
but your Gods
don't answer.

1051
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:26,613
You hurt,
but your Gods don't heal.

1052
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:29,521
You go to the V-Club
for sex and sin,

1053
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:32,220
but it doesn't fill
the void in your soul.

1054
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,594
There is truth
in the world, Lace.

1055
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,830
There is a right
and there is a wrong.

1056
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:45,405
And there is a God,

1057
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:48,904
a God who knows
the difference.

1058

<i>LACY: That's</i>
<i>how it started.</i>

1059
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:06,556
That's how
I got involved.

1060
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:11,259
I didn't know
what to do, Sister,

1061
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:14,330
where to go.

1062
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:19,431
You did the right thing by
coming to see me with this, Lacy.

1063
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:24,645
I, too, used to feel
a void in my soul.

1064
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:30,352
I, too, once hungered
to know right from wrong.

1065
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:35,547
But not anymore.

1066
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,133
Sister?

1067
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,604
You're not alone.

1068
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:03,379
(CRYING)

1069
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,988
So then, Ben did have something
to do with the bombing.

1070
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,359
He was the terrorist.

1071
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:22,630
Labels like "terrorist" are what
this corrupt and decadent culture

1072
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:25,868
calls people who are trying to
fight the real evil in this world.

1073
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:30,339
Ben was eager to strike against all that
was slowly choking this world to death,

1074
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:33,347
and so he did
something premature,

1075
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,109
something unauthorized.

1076
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:42,781
But was blowing up that
train evil, wrong? No.

1077
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:48,285
He was fighting evil
with all his heart.

1078
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:54,364
And Zoe?

1079
01:12:57,773 --> 01:13:01,038
You have no idea how
special Zoe was to us.

1080
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,145
Or is.

1081
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:20,393
DANIEL: Oh!

1082
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,732
I gotta hand it to Vergis,

1083
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,729
it's an elegant design.

1084
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:28,826
But will it work?

1085
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:33,937
Well, I won't know until I
put it into a cybernetic body

1086
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:36,500
and try and download
Zoe's avatar into it.

1087
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:37,909
How long?

1088
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:41,143
Well, a couple of days,
at least.

1089
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,252
I do have a surprise
for you, though.

1090
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:49,621
Your daughter's
avatar is ready.

1091
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:50,749
What?

1092
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:52,691
I used Zoe's original
avatar program

1093
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:55,423
to search and download
any data on Tamara Adams.

1094
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:58,125
School records,
medical DNA, you name it.

1095
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,168
About 300 megabytes' worth.

1096
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:03,068
You mean,
she's in there?

1097
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:04,765
Yeah, the more I work
with Zoe's code,

1098
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:08,003
the more I realize she was
nothing short of a computer genius.

1099
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:09,566
I want to see her.

1100
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:11,841
Thought you might.

1101
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:31,124
Baby?

1102
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:36,929
Baby?
- Daddy?

1103
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:38,831
Tammy?

1104
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:43,369
My Gods!

1105
01:14:45,848 --> 01:14:47,042
Daddy.

1106
01:14:50,552 --> 01:14:51,883
My Gods.

1107
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:53,182
(CRYING)

1108
01:14:55,424 --> 01:14:58,450
It's okay, baby.
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1109
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:03,320
I'm so scared.
What is this place? What's going on?

1110
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,055
It's okay.

1111
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,464

I know,
but you're fine.

1113
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:09,966
It's not fine.
It's not fine.

1114
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:12,165
This is wrong.
This is so wrong. No.

1115
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:15,369
I know, I know, I know.
But the important thing is we're together.

1116
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:16,536
We can be
a family again.

1117
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:18,307
I can't remember
how I got here.

1118
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,780
And I can't remember
where I was before now.

1119
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,680
It's confusing. I know.
This is gonna take some time.

1120
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,309
This isn't real.
This doesn't feel real, Dad!

1121
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,718
I don't feel real.
I'm real... This isn't real!

1122
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:28,688
It's not real.
- Willie misses you! I miss you!

1123
01:15:28,757 --> 01:15:32,420
We can be a family together.
We can be a family again.

1124
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,526
My heart isn't beating.
- I miss you.

1125
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:37,531
Daddy, my heart
isn't beating.

1126
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:40,159
Daddy, why isn't
my heart beating?

1127
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:43,068
Why isn't my heart beating?
Why isn't it...

1130
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:52,108
My baby.
- I know.

1131
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,148
She couldn't
feel her heart.

1132
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,707
She couldn't feel her heart beat.
- She'll adjust.

1133
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:59,913
She's probably very confused by
everything. It's only natural.

1134
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:02,616
No! No, it's not natural.

1135
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:05,751
No, it's wrong.
It's an abomination.

1136
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:07,556
Well, define "natural."

Artificial limbs and organs
help millions to live.

1139
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,460
You'd hardly call
those aids "natural,"

1140
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:15,696
but I doubt you'd
call them abominations.

1141

That's not what I mean
and you know it.

1142
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:22,266
Ah. Uh-huh.

1143
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:26,814
You mean, only the Gods
have power over death.

1144
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:32,448
Well, I reject that notion.
I reject that notion!

1145
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:35,285
And I'm guessing that you
don't put too much stock

1146
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:36,756
in those ideas, either.

1147
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,688
We have a chance to have
our daughters back.

1148
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:45,164
And your wife. Think of what that
would mean to your son, Joseph.

1149
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:50,494
How much would it mean to William
to be held by his mother again?

1150
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:54,207
You're not right.

1151

You're out of your

that's supposed to mean.

Why do you think your daughter was on
a lev train instead of being in school?

1170
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:59,230
Do you think she was
just cutting school?

Going shopping?

1172
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:03,710
She was leaving Caprica,

1173
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:04,837
and she wasn't
coming back.

1174

You don't know what
she was doing, okay?

1175

You can't know
because you weren't there.

1176
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,412
I know where
she was going.

1177
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,611
She told me
she had a plan.

1178
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,844
She was going to Gemenon.

1179
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:16,356
And you know why?
Because she found God.

1180
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:17,653
The real God.
- Stop it!

1181

are lost, Daddy. Okay?

don't turn to the light.

We'll talk about this later.

1184
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:28,002
When are you going to realize
that later is too late?

1185
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,201

ever want to listen?

1187

You and Mom,
you knew it all.

1188

Your arrogance was
killing your daughter.

And that's how
you lost her.

Dr. Graystone, you've not only
secured a long-term contract

1232
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,707
but you've done a great

The Vergis Corporation

If they really thought
they had a case,

1236
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:56,511
they'd have us
in court by now.

1237
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:59,348
Yes. But no matter.
It was never our intention
