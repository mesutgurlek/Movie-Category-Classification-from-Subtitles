Oswald:<i> There is a war coming...</i>
<i>a terrible war.</i>

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,138
<i>There will be chaos!</i>

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,239
Rivers of blood
in the streets.

4
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,575
I know it!
I-I can see it coming!

5
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,243
Mooney:<i> It's time.</i>
<i>Somebody has to take over.</i>

6
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,544
It might as well be me.

7
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,481
(screaming)

8
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,216
Gordon:<i> My name's james gordon,</i>
<i>a detective.</i>

9
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:18,984
My name is bruce wayne.
<i>I promise I will find</i>

10
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:20,252
The man who did this.

11
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,420
Stop or I'll shoot!

12
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:22,788
(gunshot)

13
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,089
Oswald:
<i>Mario pepper was framed</i>

14
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,491
By fish mooney and the cops.

15
00:00:25,493 --> 00:00:27,393
Why snitch on your own boss?

16
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:28,861
You want to push fish out.

17
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,162
(grunts)

18
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:32,898
I told you this is important.

19
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,199
<i>I ain't looking for no girl.</i>

20
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,868
<i>I'm looking for a weapon.</i>

21
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,436
The old man has to go.

22
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:40,906
He figures out we're working
together, we're cooked.

23
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,441
Allen: You're under
arrest for the murder

24
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:43,742
Of oswald chesterfield
cobblepot.

25
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,078
Holy crap.

26
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,581
I... Am oswald cobblepot.

27
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,454
You son of a bitch!

28
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,034
Mooney:
<i>He's alive?!</i>

29
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,302
<i>Alive?!</i>

30
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,205
No!

31
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:14,973
Boss, what's wrong?

32
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,476
Gordon didn't kill penguin
like he was told.

33
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,044
What?

34
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,113
Penguin is still alive
and working for maroni?

35
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:23,949
No.

36
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:27,586
You go find gordon,
and you bring him to me.

37
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,721
Still breathing.

38
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,524
I want to talk
to that son of a bitch.

39
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,059
Barbara (recorded):
Hey, guys. Leave a message.

40
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,695
Barbara, if you're at home,
listen to me.

41
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:39,398
I need you to get out right now.

42
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,570
I thought we were friends.
Harvey!

43
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,638
Shut up! Game's over.

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,174
Now I got to kill you and take
your body back to falcone,

45
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,510
And beg, beg him for mercy!

46
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,178
Listen to me. I screwed up.

47
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,080
But I have a plan
to make things right.

48
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:56,882
Don't kill me. Help me.

49
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,217
You think I'm an idiot?

50
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:00,819
Walk away!

51
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,121
Walk away.

52
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,425
(groans)

53
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:08,427
Help me.

54
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,095
We don't have
to go out like this.

55
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,331
You better hope
you never see me again.

56
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,169
(phone vibrating)

57
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,143
Wow.

58
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,544
What a place, huh?

59
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:32,851
A beautiful home
for a beautiful lady.

60
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,321
Please tell me what you want.

61
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,424
I guess there's no
harm in the truth.

62
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,994
See, your boyfriend
was supposed to kill

63
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,328
A certain person
for somebody.

64
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,597
Only, he didn't.

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,568
And now that somebody
is real mad.

66
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,003
Cobblepot.

67
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,437
What?

68
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,173
He didn't kill cobblepot.

69
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,508
There you go!
(gasps)

70
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,377
You're hip.

71
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,279
You are hip.

72
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:03,882
That jim gordon is
one lucky son of a gun.

73
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:07,786
What are you, like,
a hundred pounds?

74
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,589
110?

75
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:11,591
(sniffs)

76
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,392
(sighs):
Oh.

77
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:17,229
I bet that's your
real hair color, too.

78
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,365
What are you gonna...
Do to jim?

79
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,235
You ever been
with a criminal?

80
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:25,437
Some ladies
find it a turn-on.

81
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,408
Jim.
Hey!

82
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,410
Speak of the devil.

83
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,078
I was just getting
to know your lovely lady.

84
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,112
You're trespassing.
Get out.

85
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:36,114
Whoa. Slow down, hoss.

86
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:39,084
You're misreading the situation.
I'm the shot caller here.

87
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,253
The situation is you've been
told to bring me in alive,

88
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,788
Or I'd be dead already.

89
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,756
But I'm happy to kill you
right here and now.

90
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:45,958
Don't be such a hard-ass.

91
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,426
Come on, you know the rules.

92
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:50,996
You play nice,
you take your lumps...

93
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:52,898
Nobody else gets hurt.

94
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,967
Tell your friend to drop his gun
or I'll blow his brains out.

95
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,768
Oh, my god, jim.
It's okay. It's under control.

96
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,737
Drop your gun.

97
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,944
Okay.

98
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,379
Have it your way.

99
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:11,383
But now, after we kill you,
we're gonna kill blondie, too.

100
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,986
Nice and slow.

101
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,892
We've got to go.

102
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,361
Right now.

103
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,396

What?

108
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,071
Listen.

109
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,407
No, no. No.

110
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,943
Just a couple of days
and I'll join you.
No.

111
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,411
There are things
I need to do.

112
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,413
Fine. Then if you stay, I stay.

113
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,382
Okay? Because I love you, jim.

114
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:44,384
I cannot leave you.

115
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,417
I love you, too.

116
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,953
That's why you
need to leave.

117
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:51,256
If I know you're safe, there's
nothing they can do to me.

118
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:55,661
I'll make things right,
and then I'll come join you.

119
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,031
And what if you don't?

120
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,802
Don't come back.

121
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,373
Don't come back to gotham.

122
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,275
No, jim.

Gordon must die,
bullock must die,

Penguin must die today!

And maroni, too,
I suppose?

If need be.

141
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,944
You're overreacting, my dear.
This penguin's a nobody.

142
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,446
You want to start a war

143
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,148
Over the guy that
carried your umbrella?

144
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,483
He was on my hip
everywhere with me.

145
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:59,951
He knows things.

146
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:00,953
Like what?

147
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,621
Too much.

148
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,389
He knows too much!

149
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,690
Go to maroni

150
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,326
And ask him politely
to hand over your little man.

151
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,394
Politely.

152
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,029
If he refuses,

153
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,365
We can talk about
stronger measures.

154
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,367
Boss, this is
weak response.

155
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:19,171
I hate to agree with fish, but
we need to show strength now.

156
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,473
We need to hit back hard.
No talk.

157
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,708
Penguin dead, gordon dead, done.

158
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,243
Relax, niko.

159
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,545
I know what I'm doing.

160
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,979
Where is gordon?

161
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,347
I thought you were
bringing him with you.

162
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,417
No. He wouldn't come
without a struggle.

163
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,953
Now, I don't know
if he's playing tough or crazy,

164
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,589
But he's at work
like nothing's wrong.

165
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,524
I'll send victor to fetch him.

166

No need. My guys can handle him.

167
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,496
I'll send victor.

168
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,167
That's a nice
handsome bird, huh?

169
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,103
I don't know chickens.

170
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,039
(chicken squawking)

171
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,779

The old man is
right there.

Screw him. He's done.

175
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,618
Now's the time to strike.

176

not yet.
Not yet, not yet.

177

If not now, when?
Look at him.

178
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,124
Maroni clan are laughing at us,
and he plays with chickens.

179
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,193
Mooney:
That's what has me worried.

180
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,362
The chickens.
He's happy, relaxed,

181
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:19,498
As if he doesn't have
a care in the world.

182
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,167
That girl of yours
is doing her job then.
No.

183
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,169
She says he hasn't
even touched her.

184
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,104
She cooks
and she cleans for him.

185
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:27,939
He likes to watch her do chores.

186
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,474
Weird.

187
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:31,943
But if that's his thing...
No.

188
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,045
He's acting as if he knows
something important

189
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,348
That no one else knows.

190
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,691
What the hell
are you doing here?

191
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,393
I work here. It's my shift.

192
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,794
Where else should I be?

193
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:52,163
How about alaska?

194
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,032
Arrest warrants?

195
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,200
For who?

196
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,068
Mayor aubrey james,
carmine falcone

197
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,537
And their close associates.

198
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,739
On charges of conspiracy
and perversion of justice

199
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,140
In the wayne murder case.

200

Are you insane?

201
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,477
No.

202
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,145
Maybe a little.

203
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,780
Feels good.

204
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,882
They're gonna try
and kill me anyway.

205
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,617
Might as well make them
pay a price for it.

206
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,587
You're gonna arrest the mayor
and don falcone. How?

207
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,989
My testimony is attached
to the warrants.

208
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,458
That alone is enough to
indict them on a dozen counts.

209
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,094
Sure, if you could execute
the warrants, which you can't.

If the d.A. Would prosecute,
which he won't.

211
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:26,898
There's not
a single cop or lawyer

00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,504
You won't bite him, will you?

334
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,146
Hello, penguin.

335
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,749
Hello, ms. Mooney.

336
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,819
Maroni: Penguin,
ms. Mooney and her boss,

337
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:12,023
Mr. Falcone,
feel disrespected by you.

338
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,391
Oh, dear.

339
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:16,227
Well, that certainly
has never been my intention.

340
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,996
Maroni: Well, respect is
very important to them.

341
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,999
Now, I want a sincere apology
from you

342
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,601
For making them feel that way.

343
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,404
Oh, gosh, of course.

344
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,473
If I've in any way

345
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,775
Caused anyone to feel
a lack of respect,

346
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,410
I apologize.

347
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:34,679
Sincerely.

348
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,414
Maroni:
There you go.

349
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,449
Can't say
fairer than that.

350
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,922
Bloodshed, then.

351
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,991
I'm glad.

352
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,227
Jolly fat men are so tiresome.

353
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,030
And you...

354
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,666
You little

355
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:59,303
Scaly-faced bitch.

356
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,972
(inhales sharply)

357
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:04,475
Oh... What I'm gonna do to you.

358
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:10,781
"torture" is far too nice
of a word.

359
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:14,018
I'm sorry you feel
that way, fish...

360
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,353
(grunts)

361
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:26,063
Only my friends... Call me fish.

362
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,740
(laughing)

363
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,980
(church bell tolling)

364
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,827
Hey, sisters!

365
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,597
How's it hanging?

366
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,076
Holy...!

367
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,744
(horn blaring)

368
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,247
(women screaming)

369
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,482
(tires screeching)

370
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,460
Tell your boss
falcone won't let

371
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,362
Any of maroni's trucks
over the bridge.

372
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,697
Not till he
gives up penguin.

373
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,899
So, listen, you got
to get hurt a little.

374
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,634
You want a beating or a bullet?

375
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:37,969
Why we got to get hurt?

376
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:40,771
Because we're sending a message
this is a serious issue.

377
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,607
We'll tell him it's serious.
No problem.

378
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,208
Ah, you know what?

379
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,377
(men screaming)

380
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,350
How did they find out
about the gun truck, huh?!

381
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,819
That's $3 mil per
week right there!

382
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,721
Son of a bitch!

383
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,723
$4.5 mil per, gross. Cash.

384
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,291
Very aggressive move,
isn't it?

385
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:02,159
An overreaction.

386
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,527
They want to scare you.

387
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,196
Oh, is that right?
You think that they think

388
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:06,330
That don maroni can be scared?

389
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:08,532
Of course, you're right. No.

390
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:11,369
But why, then, would they
react so ferociously?

391
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:12,870
Why do they want me
back so badly?

392
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,138
I know why.

393
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,973
Because they know I got

394
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,408
A stone moneymaker here.

395
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,010
A golden goose.

396
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:21,345
They know it, and they
don't want us to have him.

397
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,347
Right, penguin?

398
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,181
Honk, honk.

399
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,750
(chuckles)

400
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,885
What?

401
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:29,487
Honk, honk.

402
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,088
It's what geese say.

403
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,256
(laughs):
Oh, right, right.

404
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,491
Honk, honk.

405
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,426
So, fine, he's a goose.

406
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:37,428
Maybe we can negotiate a price,

407
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,330
Pay them off.
Yeah.

408
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:40,464
Yes.

409
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,266
Caution is wise.

410
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:45,136
The falcone clan still is
number one, after all.

411
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,305
Paying them off is
the safe thing to do.

412
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,839
Screw safe.

413
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:51,275
They want to push me?
They think I'm gonna fold?

414
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:52,843
I'll push right
back, harder.

415
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:55,846
Hit them where
it hurts. Today.

416
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,281
You know best.

417
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:59,417
If that's how you want
to play it,

418
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:02,553
I think I know
just the spot to hit them.

419
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,230
Montoya:
I owe you an apology.

420
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:16,233
You were telling the truth,
and I wouldn't believe you.

421
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,802
Maybe my personal feelings
towards barbara

422
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,103
Got tangled up in there.

423
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:20,304
And that was wrong.

424
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,539
Forget it.

425
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:23,307
Anyhow, I-I'm sorry
for misjudging you,

426
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:26,010
And I'm very glad
that we're on the same side now.

427
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,783
Yeah, me, too.

428
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,820
So barbara's safe though?

429
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,455
You're sure she's safe?

430
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:40,524
I'm sure.

431
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,528
(allen groans)

432
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,230
Gordon, is that you?!

433
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,300
It's all right, alfred.

434
00:22:49,302 --> 00:22:50,701
It's all right. He's a friend.

435
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,969
We couldn't risk
a direct approach;

436
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,137
There's people looking for me.

437
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,172
Ah, right.
(groans)

438
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,408
Sorry about that, mate.

439
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,210
Can't be too careful.

440
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,581
In a spot of bother,
are we, sir?

441
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,152
Gordon: Renee montoya
and crispus allen.

442
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:11,422
Pleased to meet you.

443
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:14,558
Bruce, I promised I would find
your parents' killer.

444
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,328
I'm not sure I'm going to be
able to keep that promise.

445
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,331
It's a long story, but I'm
kind of in a tight spot.

446
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,266
I've upset some powerful people.

447
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,268
Stop treating me like a child.

448
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,405
Explain.

449
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,606
Bruce, you are a child.

450
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:29,774
You don't need to know...

451
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:30,941
You expect to die!

452
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,145
I'd like to know why.

453
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,349
Is it connected
to my parents' murder?

454
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:41,085
Yes, it's all connected.

455
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,488
Somehow.

456
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,324
Bruce...

457
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:49,794
I will do my best
to work this thing out.

458
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,328
But if I don't,

459
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,199
Montoya and allen here will
take over your parents' case.

460
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:56,534
I've told them
everything I know.

461
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,702
You can trust them,
one hundred percent.

462
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:00,104
One hundred percent.

463
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,278
Bruce, these are
good detectives.

464
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,448
If anyone can find
the truth, it's them.

465
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,390
Thank you.

466
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,060
Sir, what can we do
to help you now?

467
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:24,728
Nothing.

468
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,831
From here on in,
I have to go it alone.

469
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,666
I don't want anyone
else caught up in this.

470
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,634
I have to go.

471
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,036
You can hardly walk.

472
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,905
I'll be fine.

473
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:57,428
(men chattering in russian,
laughter)

474
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,005
This way.

475
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,542
Not much further.

476
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,750
It's there.

477
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,164
(chatter continues)

478
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:41,171
(men screaming)

479
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,613
(gunfire stops)

480
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,587
Oswald:
Told you.

481
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,422
Easy as pie.

482
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,558
There must be a million
dollars' worth here.

483
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,094
Yeah, you told us, all right.

484
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,096
You're clever.

485
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:08,799
You're very clever.

486
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:11,702
I sense a sarcastic
and hostile edge to your tone.

487
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:12,970
Hostile?

488
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,606
You got that right.

489
00:26:15,608 --> 00:26:18,976
You ain't no golden goose,
you're a yellow rat snitch,

490
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,245
And you got maroni
all twisted.

491
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,281
I'm so glad we're finally
clearing the air at last.

492
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,783
That's it.

493
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,585
Act smart, okay?

494
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,787
'cause all I got
to do right now

495
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:32,222
Is put a bullet in
your brain right here.

496
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,724
Bang.

497
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:35,759
See, then I go back
and I tell the boss

498
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,227
That one of niko's
men shot you.

499
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,696
Gee, that's too bad.

500
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,030
End of story.

501
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,566
(chuckles)

502
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:45,202
Yes, that's clever enough.

503
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:48,505
I never doubted
your intelligence.

504
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:49,974
That's not your problem.

505
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:53,043
Oh, I got a problem, huh?
I got a problem.

506
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,845
No, you got a problem.

507
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,146
What's my problem, schmo?

508
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,082
What drives you?

509
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,484
What's your passion?

510
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:04,054
When you know what a man loves,

511
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:06,357
You know what can kill him.

512
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,059
Do you believe this guy?

513
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:11,195
For you, it's money.

514
00:27:11,197 --> 00:27:13,030
You love money.

515
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:16,367
More than power
and respect.

516
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:19,236
You're a skinflint, mr. Carbone.

517
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,107
A cheapskate.

518
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,177
What are you guys playing at?
Let me go!

519
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,846
Sorry, frankie.

520
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,582
As I say, a cheapskate.
Carbone: Hey, come on!

521
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:33,550
Hey...
Consequently,

522
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:35,686
You don't pay
your people enough.

523
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,688
No, you know me.
You don't want to do this.

524
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,924
It is a sad fact...
You don't want
to do this.

525
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:42,693
No. No. No, no!

526
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:44,728
...That there is no loyalty
among thieves.

527
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,499
(grunts)

528
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,700
(groaning)

529
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:52,536
The simple offer
of a substantial pay raise

530
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:55,372
Is all it took to sway
these fine men.

531
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,975
(screaming)

532
00:27:57,977 --> 00:28:01,178
So, you see,
<i>that's</i> your problem!

533
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,347
Your greatest passion

534
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,216
Becomes your greatest weakness!

535
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,422
(chuckling)

536
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,663
Love, mr. Carbone.

537
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:22,299
(chuckles)

538
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,368
Love conquers all.

539
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,939
Shh.

540
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,394
My friend.

541
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:53,664
My good friend,
today is a sad day.

542
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:56,133
Nikolai was
like a son to me,

543
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,902
Just as frankie
was a son to you.

544
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:02,072
We've both lost
precious family members.

545
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,074
My condolences to you.

546
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,909
And mine to you.

547
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,845
I want this violence to stop.

548
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:09,346
Business is good.

549
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,615
The arkham project
is a gold mine.

550
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:14,251
Wayne enterprises
is back in play.

551
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,819
Life is good
for all of us.

552
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:19,690
Why risk all of that
and go to war over trifles?

553
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:24,294
Your little man there is
obviously very valuable to you.

554
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,029
We'll let you have him.

555
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:27,264
Unharmed.

556
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,666
Our gift to you.

557
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,335
And as a show of

558
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:34,772
Mutual respect,
you give us something in return.

559
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:37,641
Like such as what?

560
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,010
How about real estate?

561
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:42,880
One of your warehouses
on the river maybe.

562
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44,782
That's not gonna work.

563
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,183
I mean, I like this fella,

564
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:50,020
But we're talking about
a warehouse on the river.

565
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,293
Maroni:
Yeah.

566
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,495
Indian hill.

567
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,898
I'll give you
indian hill.

568
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,400
I'm not familiar with the name.

569
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:04,835
It's in arkham.

570
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,570
It's a toxic waste dump

571
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,539
On top of
an indian burial ground.

572
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:10,073
It's worthless.

573
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,542
Falcone:
No.

574
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:13,911
Nothing is worthless.

575
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,512
Even nothing is
worth something.

576
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:16,814
We'll take it.

577
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,817
As a token of
our mutual respect, yes?

578
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,652
You got it, my friend.

579
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,288
It's all love.

580
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,625
It's a pleasure
seeing you all.

581
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,397
Um, I heard vic zsasz
tore up the gcpd,

582
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:34,998
Tracking down gordon.

583
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,767
Did you catch him yet?

584
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:38,769
We're working on it.

585
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:40,404
Well, good luck
with that.

586
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:43,407
There's nothing more dangerous
than an honest man, huh?

587
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,498
(knocking)

588
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,334
Bullock: Jimbo,
it's me. Open up.

589
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,069
(knocking)

590
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,438
Hey.

591
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,206
Don't worry, I'm
not gonna kill you.

592
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,208
I should, but I ain't.

593
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,943
Glad to hear it.

594
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:22,546
Obviously, you figured you'd go
to the last place they'd look,

595
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,214
Because it'd be
the first place they'd reject

596
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:25,282
As being too obvious.

597
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:27,885
I-I'm sorry,
I'm being rude.

598
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:29,987
This is the duchess
of devonshire.
(laughs)

599
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:32,256
Duchess, jim gordon, putz.

600
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:33,390
Marsha. Hi.

601
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,225
Right.

602
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,793
Baby, why don't you
explore a little bit.

603
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,829
Find the bedroom,
put on your birthday suit.

604
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:40,030
(laughs)

605
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,867
And I'll find you
in a jiffy, okay? Hmm?

606
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,569
So I've been thinking.

607
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,271
You're still
a douche bag.

608
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:48,772
But you have
the moral high ground.

609
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,073
So I'm gonna back your play,

610
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,075
Whatever it is.

611
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,643
I figure
I'm doomed anyhow.

612
00:31:52,645 --> 00:31:54,811
I might as well join
the good guys.

613
00:31:54,813 --> 00:31:56,580
Thank you.

614
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:57,814
So what is your play?

615
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,549
I mean, you got one, right?
You said you did.

616
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,152
Tomorrow morning, I'm arresting
falcone and the mayor

617
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,621
For the framing
of mario pepper.

618
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,291
Conspiracy, poj,
rico, the works.

619
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,660
Well, that's a...
That's a hell of a plan.

620
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:11,061
You sit down with
a panel of chimpanzees

621
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:13,563
And a bucket of crack
and come up with that one?

622
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:16,066
I figure whatever else happens,
we'll stir things up.

623
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,467
We might even make the papers.

624
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,002
Oh, yeah, we're gonna make
the papers, all right.

625
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,604
We're gonna be dead
in the streets

626
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,406
In time for the evening edition.

627
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:24,174
Well, at least the people
will know the truth.

628
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:25,809
And we'll go out
doing our jobs,

629
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,110
Enforcing the law.

630
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,012
That's the best
inspirational speech you got?

631
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:30,580
Doing our jobs?

632
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:31,848
You don't have to join me.

633
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,050
No, I'm game.

634
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,818
Like I said, I'm doomed anyhow.

635
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,721
Now, if you'll excuse me
for one minute,

636
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:40,390
Just gonna take care
of some business.

637
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:41,792
Duchess!

638
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,529
Marco!

639
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:47,464
Marsha:
Polo!

640
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,349
Jumping catfish.

641
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,050
Good morning,
mayor james.

642
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,385
Gordon, you scared...

643
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:09,920
Scared the bejeebers
out of me.

644
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,355
Almost spilled
my coffee.

645
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,589
Sorry.

646
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:13,857
Sir, you're
under arrest.

647
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,192
That's not funny.

648
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:17,627
Depends where you're sitting.

649
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:21,465
Might want to take
a look at this.

650
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,978
How you doing, guys?

651
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,980
I'm here to have a chat
with mr. Falcone.

652
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:38,982
Sure thing, mr. Mayor.

653
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:54,231
(door opens, closes)

654
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,740
Carmine falcone,
you're under arrest.

655
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:06,276
Bullock:
Move.

656
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,880
Lie down right over there.
Stay quiet.

657
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,182
What on earth are you thinking?

658
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,750
We're thinking
we'll take you both to jail

659
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,719
And charge you with conspiracy

660
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,921
To pervert the course
of justice.
Try and take me in,

661
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:19,756
You won't make it
to the end of the street.

662
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:21,591
That's exactly what I said.

663
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,960
This is a lawful arrest.
If you resist, you will be shot.

664
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,362
I see.

665
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:28,198
We all die together
in a blaze of glory.

666
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,833
If that's how it works out,
that's fine with me.

667
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:31,101
How about you, harvey?

668
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:32,436
Fine by me.

669
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:34,604
Oh, god.
Falcone:
I envy you boys.

670
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:37,340
Having nothing to lose
must be liberating.

671
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:38,975
Must feel pretty good.

672
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,444
Yes, it does.

673
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:41,478
Suppose you did have
something to lose.

674
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
What would you do then?

675
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:44,181
Suppose,
for instance,

676
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:47,684
I had a knife to barbara kean's
throat right now.

677
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,386
Would you still
be so brave?

678
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:50,454
You don't.

679
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:51,955
I'm telling you I do.

680
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:53,290
You're a liar.

681
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,558
I have many faults,

682
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,893
But I'm not a liar.

683
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:59,196
Victor zsasz has barbara.

684
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:00,931
You know victor.

685
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,401
You're lying. She's far away.

686
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:05,969
She came back.

687
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:08,338
Came right to me
to plead for your life.

688
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,474
You have a good
woman there.

689
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:12,542
She loves you
very much.

690
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:14,411
Too much.

691
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,415
Prove it.

692
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:19,883
Prove you have her.

693
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:21,685
I could.

694
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,453
But I won't.

695
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,022
I want you to believe me.

696
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,658
It's obvious, jim. He's lying.

697
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,393
Am I?

698
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:32,596
If you think so,

699
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:35,132
Go ahead and try to bring me in.

700
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,733
You'll be dead,

701
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:39,436
So you won't know what
happens to barbara.

702
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:41,304
But it won't be pretty.

703
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,506
Lying.

704
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:44,941
On my mother's grave.

705
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,244
Drop your gun,

706
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,713
And barbara won't be
harmed in any way.

707
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,453
Those muffins
smell good.

708
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:59,256
None for you, creep.

709
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:02,058
She can have one
if she wants.

710
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,262
No, thank you.

711
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,164
(ringtone playing)

712
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,511
Got it.

713
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,419
What a shame.

714
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,790
Oh, this is embarrassing;
he straight-up

715
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,559
Bluffed you into folding.

716
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,761
We could've gone out like
heroes; now we're fish food.

717
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,633
Okay, so it
wasn't a bluff.

718
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,069
Falcone:
I'm sorry if she was

719
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,737
Mistreated a little.
We needed to be

720
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,040
Sure she had nothing
useful to tell us.

721
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:51,341
Untie her, victor.

722
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,078
I'm sorry.

723
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,080
It's okay.
It's okay.

724
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:58,815
What am I gonna do with you?

725
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:01,718
By rights, you
have to die.

726
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,020
Whoa, hello.
Uh, I'm late for work.

727
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,490
Quite an adventure.
I'll be on my way.

728
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,126
Falcone:
Such a waste though.

729
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:12,562
Gotham needs men like you,
both of you.

730
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,965
Strong men
with principles.

731
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:16,299
I wish I could
make you see

732
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:17,934
I'm not the enemy.

733
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,769
The system is
not the enemy.

734
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,938
The enemy is anarchy.

735
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,075
But I told you that
before, didn't I, jim?

736
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,543
Yes, you did.

737
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:28,812
You didn't listen though.

738
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:31,848
Do we get a last meal or a smoke
or anything, or just talk?

739
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,217
Falcone: But today,
you believed me.

740
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,152
You trusted my word.

741
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:38,922
That's a good first step.

742
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,824
Perhaps there's still
hope for you.

743
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:49,532
Yes.

744
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:52,002
Go. Get out of here
before I change my mind.

745
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:53,837
Wait a minute.
Quiet.

746
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,542
It's been a
pleasure, barbara.

747
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:02,012
I do admire
a brave woman.

748
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,315
What's the catch?

749
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:07,083
Jim, he said we could go.
Let's not haggle here.

750
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,919
What's the catch, mr. Falcone?

751
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:12,756
I want you to think
about what I said.

752
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:16,393
I want you to
understand the truth.

753
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:17,794
That's all I ask.

754
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,330
The catch is...

755
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:23,033
Someday soon,
you'll see I'm right.

756
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,952
Barbara...

757
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,954
I'm sorry.

758
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:48,792
I was just trying
to help, and...

759
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:51,027
I don't know what...

760
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,301
I love you so much.

761
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,138
(thunder rumbling)

762
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,519
Mmm.

763
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:17,821
Excellent.

764
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:19,089
Delicious!

765
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:20,357
Yes.

766
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:21,925
I followed the recipe.

767
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,893
You're right, mr. F.,
cooking is easy.

768
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,264
I'm sorry you had
to see all that earlier.

769
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:30,433
Not pleasant.

770
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:31,901
I understand.

771
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,236
Business is business.

772
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:34,471
Mm-hmm.

773
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:36,940
Yes, it is.

774
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:39,676
I'll go see to
the chickens.

775
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,581
(chickens clucking)

776
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,616
(falcone clucking)

777
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:48,685
Any eggs, my dears?

778
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,764
Don falcone.

779
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,470
My friend.

780
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:09,105
Good to see you.

781
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,607
I was just thinking

782
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:12,642
About the night
we met.

783
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:20,183
Cut them down.

784
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:23,553
Where's the snitch?

785
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:25,388
I want to
speak to him.

786
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:32,462
Cobblepot, is it?

787
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:38,568
Condemned men are
honest men, I find.

788
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,371
What can you tell me
before you go?

789
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,712
Don falcone.

790
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:51,815
It is a great
honor, sir.

791
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:56,519
Indeed, I can tell a secret
of great value to you...

792
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:58,822
If you grant me
one last request.

793
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,657
Which is what?

794
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,192
(sniffles)

795
00:41:02,194 --> 00:41:04,527
Give the job of killing me
to james gordon.

796
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:07,030
Why him?

797
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:09,065
He's the only man
under your sway

798
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:10,500
Who has a conscience.

799
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:12,368
The only one
who might be persuaded

800
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,570
To spare my life.

801
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:16,039
Why would I agree to that?

802
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,907
I want you dead.
You're a snitch.

803
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:23,246
If you agree
and gordon spares me,

804
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:25,114
Then I will become<i> your</i> snitch.

805
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,517
For life.

806
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,487
I will come back to gotham
under a different name,

807
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:32,755
And I will work my way
into the maroni family,

808
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,290
And I will snitch for you.

809
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:36,993
I am excellent at
this sort of work.

810
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,628
I have a gift for it.

811
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,997
I really do, sir.

812
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,178
Deal.

813
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,081
Gordon will get the
job of killing you.

814
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:01,951
Thank you, sir.

815
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:05,855
What is the valuable secret?

816
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,992
Oh, yes.

817
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:10,493
Fish mooney
and nikolai the russian

818
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:13,196
Only pretend to hate each other.

819
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,664
They're lovers.

820
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,033
And fish is
pushing nikolai

821
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,102
To take your place.

822
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,539
Is that so?

823
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,773
Yes, sir.

824
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:27,110
But only so fish
can take over from him.

825
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,449
That is a good secret.

826
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,587
It's almost uncanny.

827
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:40,924
Everything played out
exactly as you said it would.

828
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:43,560
We got rid of
nikolai painlessly,

829
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,828
And maroni thinks
you're a wizard.

830
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:49,165
You really do
have a gift.

831
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,900
But I think we're
making a mistake

832
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,835
Letting gordon live.

833
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,337
He's trouble.

834
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:58,107
Thank you so much
for sparing him.

835
00:42:58,109 --> 00:42:59,809
I appreciate the favor.

836
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,277
(thunder rumbling softly)

837
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:02,979
Don't worry.

838
00:43:02,981 --> 00:43:04,781
He'll see the light.

839
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:06,015
One way or another.

840
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:08,084
I guarantee it.
