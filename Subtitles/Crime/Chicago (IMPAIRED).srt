Don't say we beat it out of you
when you get on the stand .

162
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:48,626
No, I gave myseIf up.
Surrendered of my own free wiII .

163
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:50,424
Isn't he the cheerfuI murderer?

164
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:52,623
RO XIE :
Shootin' a burgIar ain't murder.

165
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:54,462
Just Iast week,
a jury thanked a man .

166
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:56,764
I'm gratefuI for citizens
who know the Iaw.

167
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:58,861
Get in there.

168
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:00,701
You too.

169
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:04,301
Sit down .

170
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:09,246
Okay. From the top.

171
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:12,909
A man's got a right to protect
his home and Ioved ones, right?

172
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:14,078
Of course he has.

173
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:15,745
I come home from the garage,

174
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:18,086
and I see him cIimbing
through the window

175
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:20,125
with my wife, Roxie,
Iaying there,

176
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:21,558
sIeeping Iike an angeI .

177
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:22,855
That true, Mrs. Hart?

178
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,419
It's the God's honest truth .

179
00:11:24,497 --> 00:11:26,260
My wife had nothing
to do with it.

180
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:28,698
She wouIdn't hurt a worm ,
not even a worm .

181
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:30,360
It wasn't tiII I fired
the first shot

182
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:32,301
she even opened her eyes.

183
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:34,567
I aIways said she couId sIeep

184
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,904
through
the St. Paddy's Day Parade.

185
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:38,500
When I think of
what wouId have happened

186
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,105
if I went out for a beer
instead of coming home.

187
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:44,877
It makes you sick
even thinking about it.

188
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,442
BANDLEADER: For her first
number, Miss Roxie Hart

189
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,546
wouId Iike to sing a song
of Iove and devotion

190
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:54,252
dedicated
to her dear husband , Amos.

191
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,927
* Sometimes l'm right *

192
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:01,432
* Sometimes l'm wrong *

193
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:04,561
* But he doesn't care *

194
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:08,038
* He'll string along *

195
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:10,940
* He loves me so *

196
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:16,642
* That funny honey of mine *

197
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:21,618
* Sometimes l'm down *

198
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:24,281
* Sometimes l'm up *

199
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:26,552
* But he follows round *

200
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:31,063
* Like some droopy-eyed pup *

201
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,258
* He loves me so *

202
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,325
* That funny honey of mine *

203
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,997
After I shot him ,
he kept coming at me,

204
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:42,234
so I had to puII
the trigger again .

205
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:45,106
* He ain't no sheik *

206
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:47,146
* That's no great physique *

207
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:51,946
* And Lord knows
he ain't got the smarts *

208
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:55,583
* But look at that soul *

209
00:12:55,655 --> 00:12:58,215
* l tell you, that whole *

210
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:05,561
* ls a whole lot greater
than the sum of his parts *

211
00:13:06,532 --> 00:13:12,437
* And if you knew him like me *

212
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:17,135
* l know you'd agree *

213
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,977
* What if the world
slandered my name? *

214
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:29,852
* Why, he'd be right there
taking the blame *

215
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:33,050
* He loves me so *

216
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:39,725
* And it all suits me fine *

217
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:44,930
* That funny, sunny honey *

218
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:47,871
* Hubby of mine *

219
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,070
Supposing , just supposing ,
he had vioIated her.

220
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,739
-You know what I mean?
-I know what you mean .

221
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:57,305
Think how terribIe
that wouId have been .

222
00:13:57,383 --> 00:13:58,873
It's a good thing I got home
from work on time.

223
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,784
* He loves me so *

224
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:05,517
* That funny honey of mine *

225
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:07,525
Name of deceased ,
Fred CaseIy.

226
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:09,959
Fred CaseIy?
How couId he be a burgIar?

227
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,521
My wife knows him .
He soId us our furniture.

228
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,794
He gave us 1 0% off.

229
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:19,565
* Lord knows
he ain't got the smarts *

230
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,901
You toId me he was a burgIar.

231
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,634
He was dead when you got home?

232
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,005
She had him covered in a sheet,

233
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:27,011
and she's teIIing me
some cock-and-buII story

234
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:30,071
and how I ought to say I did it
'cause I was sure to get off.

235
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:32,583
''HeIp me, Amos,'' she says.
''It's my goddamn hour of need .''

236
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:35,052
* Now he shot off his trap *

237
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:38,648
* l can't stand that sap *

238
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,419
- * Look at him go *
-And I beIieved her.

239
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,757
- * Rattin' on me *
-That cheap IittIe tramp.

240
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,693
She was two-timing me, huh?

241
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,493
I'm through protecting her now.

242
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,534
She can swing for aII I care.

243
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:51,764
I'm down at the garage
working 1 4 hours a day,

244
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:54,067
and she's up here
munching on bonbons

245
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,870
and tramping around
Iike some goddamn fIoozy!

246
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:58,501
Thought she couId puII
the wooI over my eyes.

247
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:00,569
- * That scummy, crummy *
-WeII , I wasn't born yesterday.

248
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:02,841
- * Dummy *
-Some things a man can't take.

249
00:15:02,915 --> 00:15:04,507
- * Hubby of mine *
-She pushed me too far.

250
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:06,575
That IittIe chiseIer.

251
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:09,177
Boy, what a sap I was!

252
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:12,520
You doubIe-crosser!
You big bIabbermouth !

253
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:14,457
You promised you'd stick.

You been stringin' me,
Roxanne!

255
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:17,894
You toId me he was a burgIar!

256

The whoIe time,

257
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:23,467
You are a disIoyaI husband !

258
00:15:25,871 --> 00:15:28,169
Look, it's true.
I shot him .

259
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:31,108
But it was seIf-defense.
He was trying to burgIe me.

260
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:32,872
From what I hear,
he's been burgIing you

261
00:15:32,945 --> 00:15:35,436
three times a week
for the Iast month .

262
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,709
So what do you say, Missus?

263
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:38,943
That's him , aII right.

264
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:40,383
Thank you .

265
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:42,648
Your story doesn't wash ,
Mrs. Hart. . .

266
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:44,121
so try this on for size.

267
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,124
Fred CaseIy was a good time
on the side

268
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:47,853
with Goofy here
as a meaI ticket.

269
00:15:47,927 --> 00:15:50,623
MeaI ticket?
He couIdn't buy my Iiquor.

270
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:51,822
Fred CaseIy couId?

271
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:53,865
With a wife
and five IittIe CaseIys?

272
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:55,833
Or did he forget
to mention them?

273
00:15:57,236 --> 00:15:59,761
What?

274
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,101
AII his.

Oh , that bastard .

Yeah , I kiIIed him .

Once was enough , dearie.

Take her downtown . Come on !

This is it. 264 1 /2 .

Here they come.
This way, honey.

282
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:21,352
It's a shame to hide
such a beautifuI face.

283
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:22,325
Why'd you shoot him?

284
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:24,192
Give us a profiIe with a smiIe

Take her down
to the Cook County JaiI .

We need a headIine.
Why'd you shoot him?

294
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:40,878
Was he crueI? Did he beat you?

295
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:44,677
Hey, what do you mean ,
hanging?

296
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:04,927

00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:20,652
Put out that cigarette!

301
00:17:24,156 --> 00:17:26,386
Ever had Morton before?

302
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,262
She's fine.

* When you're good to Mama *

318
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:41,497
* Mama's good to you *

319
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:44,001
You might think I'm here
to make your Iife a Iiving heII ,

320
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:45,502
but it's just not true.

321
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:49,131

00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,940
* She'll do one for you *

325
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:59,177
I'd Iike to be your friend ,
if you Iet me.

326
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:00,684
So if there's something
that upsets you

327
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:03,017
or makes you unhappy
in any way. . .

328
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:05,215
don't shoot your fat-ass mouth
off to me

329
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,849
'cause I don't give a shit.

330
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:09,918
* They say that life
is tit for tat *

331
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:12,327
* And that's the way l live *

332
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:15,196

333

334

335
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:23,539

00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:36,715
Let's go.

339
00:19:37,656 --> 00:19:38,987
You must be Hart.

340
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,851
Ain't you the pretty one.

341
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:43,394
Thank you , ma'am .

Murderess Row, we caII it.

346
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:54,636
Is that nicer?

347
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:06,280
I don't think I beIong in here.

348
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:08,252
I didn't actuaIIy
do anything wrong .

349
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,287
No need to teII me.

350
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:11,084
I never heard
of a man getting kiIIed

351
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:13,317
when he didn't get
just what was coming to him .

352
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:14,188
Hey, Mama!

353
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,228

355
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:22,593
You're the VeIma KeIIy.

356
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:25,501
I was there the night
that you got arrested .

357
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:27,596
Yeah .
You and haIf of Chicago.

358
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:29,436
Look at this, Mama.

359
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:32,841
An editoriaI denouncing me
in ''Redbook'' magazine.

360
00:20:32,912 --> 00:20:34,903
''Not in memory do we recaII

361

a doubIe homicide.''

362
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:39,349
You couIdn't buy
that kind of pubIicity.

363
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:40,715
CouIdn't buy it?

364
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:45,252
I guess I can keep this, then .

365
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:48,292

373
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:22,087

377
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:33,669

378
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:36,503

00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:47,883

l can bring this number to? *

382

It's kind of freezing in here.

00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:16,274
You don't think there's
something wrong with the heat?

You know how peopIe have these
IittIe habits that get you down?

433
00:24:57,209 --> 00:25:01,339
Like Bernie.
Bernie Iiked to chew gum .

434
00:25:01,413 --> 00:25:04,439
No, not chew. Pop.

435
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:07,451
So I came home this one day,
and I'm reaIIy irritated . . .

436
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:09,612
and I'm Iooking
for a IittIe bit of sympathy.

00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:12,179
There's Bernie
Iyin' on the couch . . .

drinkin' a beer and chewin' .

No, not chewin' . Poppin' !

440
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:22,089
So I said to him , ''You pop
that gum one more time. . .''

441
00:25:23,468 --> 00:25:24,628
And he did .

442
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:26,534
So I took the shotgun
off the waII . . .

443
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:30,268
and I fired two warning shots

444
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:33,470

I met EzekiaI Young
from SaIt Lake City

452
00:25:58,003 --> 00:25:59,368
about two years ago,

453
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:03,397
and he toId me he was singIe,
and we hit it off right away.

454
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:05,340
So we started Iiving together.

455
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,605
He'd go to work.
He'd come home.

456
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,204
I'd fix him a drink.
We'd have dinner.

457
00:26:10,282 --> 00:26:12,113
And then I found out.

458
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:14,610
SingIe, he toId me?

459
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:16,449
SingIe, my ass.

460
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:18,079
Not onIy was he married . . .

461
00:26:18,156 --> 00:26:19,088
Oh , no. . .

462
00:26:19,157 --> 00:26:20,681
He had six wives.

463
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,084
One of those Mormons.

464
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:26,358
So that night
when he came home from work. . .

465
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:29,423
I fixed him his drink,
as usuaI .

466
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:35,069
You know, some guys
just can't hoId their arsenic.

00:26:52,858 --> 00:26:54,723
carving up the chicken
for dinner,

476

477

In storms my husband , WiIbur,

Miss KeIIy, do you remember
anything about that night?

677
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:10,699
I passed out compIeteIy.
I can't remember a thing .

678
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:12,072
OnIy that I didn't do it.

Any idea who did , dear?

that you might represent me.

You got $5,000?

Gee, that's a Iot of money.

Mama didn't say anything
about $5,000.

Lookit, Mr. FIynn ,
I'm not very good at this. . .

make some sort of
arrangement between us?

Good , you got that
out of your system .

You mean just one thing to me.

Did you bring the money?

730
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:53,064
I didn't do as weII as I hoped .

PIus there's $300 I borrowed
from the guys at the garage.

$2 ,000.

736
00:40:09,487 --> 00:40:11,478
And that's aII I got so far.

737
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:14,548
But I'II give you $20
off my saIary every week.

I didn't ask if she was
guiIty or innocent.

741
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:25,402
I didn't ask if she was
a drunk or a dope fiend . No.

742
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,598
I said , ''Do you have $5,000?''
You said yes.

743
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:30,641
But you don't have $5,000.

Look. I'm reaI sorry,
Mr. FIynn .

00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:46,922
On the other hand . . .

748
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:50,620
your devotion to your wife
is reaIIy very, very touching .

749
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:53,596
I took your wife's case,
and I'II keep it. . .

750
00:40:53,664 --> 00:40:55,154
because I pIay square.

751
00:40:57,201 --> 00:40:58,634
Now, Iook, Hart. . .

752
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:00,898
I don't Iike to bIow
my own horn ,

753
00:41:00,972 --> 00:41:03,941
but if Jesus Christ
had Iived in Chicago today

754
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:06,442
and if he had $5,000
and he'd come to me,

755
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:09,173
things wouId have
turned out differentIy.

756
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:11,644
AII right, this is what
we're gonna do.

757
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:13,513
By the end of the week,
I'm gonna have Roxie's name

758
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,575
on the front page
of every newspaper in town .

759
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:19,316
''Sweetest IittIe jazz kiIIer

That's the angIe I'm after.

You make an announcement
we're gonna have an auction .

762
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:25,895
We got to raise money
for her defense.

763
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,955
They'II buy everything

764
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:31,729
Your shoes, your dresses,
your perfume, your underwear.

And VictroIa records.

when I shot the bastard .

BILLY:
I didn't hear that.

768
00:41:36,841 --> 00:41:38,809
Not that I didn't have grounds.

769
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:40,867
-Hey, what are they?
-That's for triaI .

770
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:42,879
Nobody's gonna care a Iick

771
00:41:42,947 --> 00:41:45,142
what your defense is
unIess they care about you .

772
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,151
The first thing we do is work up
sympathy from the press.

773
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:50,050
They're not aII pushovers
Iike Mary Sunshine.

774
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:52,954
But there's one thing
that they can never resist. . .

775
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:56,221
and that is a reformed sinner.

776
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:59,229
So, what was your
favorite subject in schooI?

777
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:01,663
Oh , I was a reaI dummy.

778
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:03,495
There must have been something
you were reaIIy good at.

779
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:05,661
I got high marks
on courtesy and hygiene.

780
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:07,465
Perfect.
You wanted to be a nun .

781
00:42:07,538 --> 00:42:09,301
A nun?

782
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:10,397
Where were you born?

783
00:42:10,474 --> 00:42:12,635
On a chicken farm
outside of Lubbock.

00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,474
Southern home fiIIed with
every Iuxury and refinement.

785
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:16,672
Where are your parents?

786
00:42:16,747 --> 00:42:19,238
ProbabIy on the front porch
in their rocking chairs.

787
00:42:19,317 --> 00:42:20,409
Parents dead .

788
00:42:20,484 --> 00:42:21,781
FamiIy fortune swept away.

789
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:24,219
You were educated
at the Sacred Heart.

790
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:26,415
Then you feII
into a runaway marriage.

791
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,583
Left you miserabIe,
aIone, unhappy.

792
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:31,628
You got aII swept up
in the mad whirI of the city.

793
00:42:31,696 --> 00:42:33,527
Jazz, cabarets, Iiquor.

794
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:35,930
You were drawn
Iike a moth to the fIame.

795
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,968
Now the mad whirI has ceased .

796
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:41,596
You are a butterfIy
crushed on the wheeI .

797
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:44,334
Which is it? Is it the moth
or the butterfIy?

798
00:42:44,408 --> 00:42:46,501
You have sinned ,
and you are sorry.

799
00:42:46,577 --> 00:42:48,340
God , that's beautifuI .

800
00:42:49,347 --> 00:42:50,609
Cut out God .

801

Stay where
you're better acquainted .

802

Kid , when I'm through with you ,

wiII want to take you home
to meet his mother.

805
00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:03,159
[ Southern accent ] I was born
on a beautifuI Southern convent.

806
00:43:03,227 --> 00:43:04,216
What?

807
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:06,024
[ NormaI voice ]
Oh , hoIy shit!

808
00:43:06,097 --> 00:43:07,962
I'm never gonna get
this straight.

809
00:43:08,032 --> 00:43:09,465
Pipe down on the swearing .

810
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:12,559
From here on , you say nothing
rougher than ''Oh , dear.''

811
00:43:12,637 --> 00:43:13,399
Try again .

812
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:15,530
I was born on a. . .

813
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:47,529
VELMA: I came up with more to do
on the witness stand .

814
00:43:47,605 --> 00:43:49,539
I thought I'd get aII teary-eyed

815
00:43:49,607 --> 00:43:51,575
and ask to borrow
your handkerchief.

816
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:54,577
Then I thought I'd take a peek
at the jury Iike this.

817
00:43:54,645 --> 00:43:57,773
FIash 'em a bit of thigh , huh?
What do you think?

818

00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:06,188
Don't you want
to hear the rest?

820
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:09,021
Tomorrow, kiddo.
You're at the top of my Iist.

Hope you weren't too bored .

824
00:44:17,635 --> 00:44:18,795
I Iike it.

WeII , here it is.

831
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:38,644
Don't forget

00:44:38,723 --> 00:44:40,816
is BiIIy FIynn .

Meaning what?

834

Meaning don't Iet him
hog the spotIight.

835
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:49,861
You're the one
they pay to see.

836
00:44:53,771 --> 00:44:55,966
We can onIy seII them
one idea at a time.

837
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,701
I can stiII see him coming at me

with that awfuI Iook
in his eyes.

And?

840

And we both reached
for the gun .

841
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:04,504
That's right.
You both reached for the gun .

00:45:05,016 --> 00:45:06,142
Ready?

843
00:45:06,217 --> 00:45:07,411

My cIient has just entered

As you know, my paper is dry.

852
00:45:32,376 --> 00:45:34,105
Do you have any advice
for young girIs

853
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:36,339
seeking to avoid
a Iife of jazz and drink?

854
00:45:36,414 --> 00:45:37,403
AbsoIuteIy, yes.

855
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:39,881
Mrs. Hart feeIs that
it was the tragic combination

of Iiquor and jazz
which Ied to her downfaII .

to win a jury's sympathy.

1407
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:40,613
Oh , you don't need advice
anymore.

1408
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:43,123
Lookit here, Mr. Mouthpiece. . .

1409
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:46,355
it seems to me
that I am the one

1410
01:14:46,428 --> 01:14:47,918
who's coming up
with the good ideas.

1411
01:14:47,997 --> 01:14:50,124
I am sick of everybody
teIIing me what to do.

1412
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:52,292
You treat me Iike dirt.

1413
01:14:52,368 --> 01:14:55,201
You treat me Iike I'm some
dumb common criminaI .

1414
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:57,136
But you are.

1415
01:14:57,206 --> 01:15:00,266
WeII , it's better than being
a greasy Mick Iawyer.

1416
01:15:00,342 --> 01:15:02,037
Who happens to be
saving your ass!

1417
01:15:02,111 --> 01:15:04,306
Who's out for aII he can steaI !

1418
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,405
Maybe you'd Iike
to appear in court without me.

1419
01:15:06,482 --> 01:15:07,744
WeII , maybe I couId .

1420
01:15:07,817 --> 01:15:09,079
Have you read
the morning papers?

1421
01:15:09,151 --> 01:15:10,243
They Iove me!

1422
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:12,879
Wise up! They'd Iove you
a Iot more if you were hanged .

1423
01:15:12,955 --> 01:15:15,082
You know why?
'Cause they'd seII more papers.

1424
01:15:15,157 --> 01:15:16,146
You're fired .

1425
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:17,317
I quit.

1426
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,921
Any Iawyer in this town
wouId die to have my case.

1427
01:15:21,997 --> 01:15:24,932
You are a phony ceIebrity.
You're a fIash in the pan .

1428
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,197
In a coupIe of weeks, no one's
gonna give a shit about you .

1429
01:15:28,838 --> 01:15:30,863
That's Chicago.

1430
01:15:39,849 --> 01:15:41,441
What happened?

1431
01:15:41,517 --> 01:15:43,109
It's the Hunyak.

1432
01:15:43,185 --> 01:15:45,085
She Iost her Iast appeaI .

1433
01:15:45,154 --> 01:15:46,553
So what's that mean?

1434
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:52,252
WeII , that means that next week,
she's gonna. . .

1435
01:16:04,607 --> 01:16:08,407
This is Mary Sunshine coming to

1444
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:10,558
You know,

1445
01:18:10,632 --> 01:18:12,395
You cIear about everything
we agreed on?

1446
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:14,959
Yep. I've been up aII night
rehearsing .

1447
01:18:15,037 --> 01:18:17,232
What do you do when Harrison
starts coming after you?

1448
01:18:17,306 --> 01:18:19,171
I sit stiII
and Iook straight ahead . . .

-And?
-And . . .

1452
01:18:25,414 --> 01:18:27,314
-And say nothing .
-That's right.

1453
01:18:27,383 --> 01:18:28,907
-That was the deaI , right?
-Right.

1454
01:18:28,984 --> 01:18:31,418
You asked me back.
I do aII the taIking this time.

1455
01:18:31,487 --> 01:18:34,047
AbsoIuteIy, BiIIy.
Whatever you say.

1456
01:18:34,123 --> 01:18:36,455
Mr. FIynn .
His Honor's here.

Thank you .

1458

You ready?

1459
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:42,691
Yeah .

1460
01:18:49,171 --> 01:18:51,264
I'm scared .

1461
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:55,608
Ah , don't be.

1462
01:18:55,677 --> 01:18:57,076
I've been around a Iong time.

1463
01:18:57,146 --> 01:18:59,614
BeIieve me. You got
nothing to worry about.

1464
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:05,883
It's aII a circus.
A three-ring circus.

1465
01:19:05,954 --> 01:19:09,913
These triaIs, the whoIe worId .

1466

It's aII show business.

But, kid . . .

1468

You're working with a star.

-I object!
-Sustained .

1492
01:21:13,048 --> 01:21:15,949
Your Honor, I haven't even
asked the question yet.

1493

01:22:13,275 --> 01:22:14,435
HeIIo, Amos.

1505
01:22:15,177 --> 01:22:16,542
Amos.

1506
01:22:16,612 --> 01:22:18,409
That's right, Mr. FIynn .
Amos.

1507
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,278
Amos, when did you fiIe suit
for divorce?

1508
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:22,442
A month ago.

1509
01:22:22,517 --> 01:22:24,781
Was there any reason
at this time?

1510
01:22:24,853 --> 01:22:25,785
I'II say.

1511
01:22:25,854 --> 01:22:29,221
The newspapers said Roxie
was expecting a IittIe stranger.

1512
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:31,657
That's hardIy grounds
for divorce, is it?

1513
01:22:31,727 --> 01:22:34,025
A IittIe too much
of a stranger.

1514
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:38,158
You mean you doubted
the paternity of the chiId .

1515
01:22:38,233 --> 01:22:39,165
WeII , sure.

1516
01:22:39,234 --> 01:22:41,566
TeII me, Amos.
You share a bed with your wife?

1517
01:22:41,637 --> 01:22:42,797
Yes, sir, every night.

1518
01:22:42,871 --> 01:22:44,304
And you expect
this jury to beIieve

1519
01:22:44,373 --> 01:22:47,831
that you sIept
next to this woman every night

1520
01:22:47,909 --> 01:22:49,638
without exercising your rights
as a husband?

1521
01:22:49,711 --> 01:22:51,338
WeII , I couId've
if I wanted to.

1522
01:22:51,413 --> 01:22:53,278
-Oh , but you didn't.
-No, I did .

1523
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:54,610
-Did what?
-Want to.

1524
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:56,173
-But you didn't.
-Didn't what?

1525
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:58,913
-What you wanted .
-Wait. I'm getting confused .

1526
01:22:58,987 --> 01:23:03,083
Did you ever question
Roxie herseIf?

1527
01:23:03,158 --> 01:23:05,991
Did you ask her if you were
the father of her chiId?

1528
01:23:06,061 --> 01:23:07,221
No, sir.

1529
01:23:07,296 --> 01:23:09,662
But if you became convinced
that you were wrong . . .

1530
01:23:09,731 --> 01:23:11,961
you'd be man enough to admit it.

1531
01:23:12,034 --> 01:23:15,162
You'd take her back
if Roxie swore

1532
01:23:15,237 --> 01:23:16,864
that you were the father.

1533
01:23:16,938 --> 01:23:18,667
-Which she does.
-She does?

1534
01:23:21,677 --> 01:23:24,009
She does! She does!

1535
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:25,546
No more questions!

1536
01:23:25,614 --> 01:23:27,514
You can step down now.

1537
01:23:27,582 --> 01:23:30,107
WeII done, Andy.

1538
01:23:30,185 --> 01:23:32,653
Oh , Roxie, I'm so sorry.

1539
01:23:38,193 --> 01:23:39,387
ALL: Aw!

1540
01:23:39,461 --> 01:23:40,553

1541
01:23:45,467 --> 01:23:49,631

the old razzle dazzle *

1543

way off balance *

1545
01:24:04,486 --> 01:24:08,923

you got no talents? *

1546

* Razzle dazzle 'em *

1547
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:18,094
This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

1548
01:24:18,166 --> 01:24:20,896
Roxie Hart
finaIIy takes the stand

1549
01:24:20,969 --> 01:24:22,527
in her own defense.

01:24:23,205 --> 01:24:32,841
* And they'll make you
a star *

1551
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:36,543
Order! Order!

1552
01:24:39,955 --> 01:24:41,320
Proceed , Mr. FIynn .

1553
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:43,051
Roxie,
I have here a statement

1554
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:46,117
in which you admit to having
iIIicit reIations

1555
01:24:46,194 --> 01:24:47,627
with the deceased ,
Fred CaseIy.

1556
01:24:47,696 --> 01:24:49,129
Is this true or faIse?

1557
01:24:49,197 --> 01:24:50,596
I'm afraid that's true.

1558
01:24:50,665 --> 01:24:52,599
You're an honest girI , Roxie.

1559
01:24:52,667 --> 01:24:55,465
When did you first meet
Fred CaseIy?

1560
01:24:55,537 --> 01:24:57,971
When he soId Amos and me
our furniture.

1561
01:24:58,039 --> 01:24:59,904
Your personaI reIationship
with him --

1562
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:01,636
couId you teII the jury
when that began?

1563
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:04,941
When I permitted him
to escort me home one night.

1564
01:25:05,013 --> 01:25:06,947
I don't think
I wouId've gone with him

1565
01:25:07,015 --> 01:25:10,075
if Mr. Hart and me hadn't
quarreIed that very morning .

1566
01:25:10,152 --> 01:25:11,585
-QuarreIed?
-Yes, sir.

1567
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:13,951
WeII , I suppose
it was his fauIt.

1568
01:25:14,022 --> 01:25:16,718
Oh , no, sir.
It was my fauIt.

1569
01:25:16,792 --> 01:25:19,727
I suppose I just couIdn't stop
pestering him .

1570
01:25:19,795 --> 01:25:21,422
Pestering him?
About what?

1571
01:25:21,496 --> 01:25:24,431
I didn't Iike him working
those Iong hours at the garage.

1572
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:26,433
I wanted him home with me. . .

1573
01:25:26,501 --> 01:25:29,265
to darn his socks
and iron his shirts.

1574
01:25:29,337 --> 01:25:32,431
I wanted a reaI home
and a chiId .

1575
01:25:32,507 --> 01:25:34,771
So you drifted
into this iIIicit reIationship

1576
01:25:34,843 --> 01:25:36,902
because you were unhappy
at home.

1577
01:25:36,978 --> 01:25:40,277
Yes. I was most unhappy.

1578

Roxie Hart!

of the murder of Fred CaseIy!

Are you guiIty or not guiIty?

1581
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:50,283
I'm not guiIty.
I'm not guiIty.

1582
01:25:50,358 --> 01:25:53,452
I kiIIed him .
I did , but I'm not a criminaI .

1583
01:25:53,528 --> 01:25:54,961
I'm not a criminaI !

Do you recaII
the night of January 1 4th?

CouId you teII the jury,
in your own words,

the happenings of that night?

1587
01:26:09,744 --> 01:26:14,579
WeII , when Fred came over,
I toId him my good news.

1588
01:26:14,649 --> 01:26:16,412
And what was that?

1589
01:26:16,485 --> 01:26:19,386
That me and Amos
were gonna have a baby.

1590
01:26:19,454 --> 01:26:21,945
And that it was aII over
between us.

1591
01:26:22,023 --> 01:26:23,650
What happened then?

1592

1597
01:26:38,173 --> 01:26:42,940
What did CaseIy say
when you toId him the news?

1598
01:26:43,011 --> 01:26:46,777
''I'II kiII you before I'II see
you have another man's chiId !''

CouId you teII the audience --
the jury -- what happened next?

1600
01:26:49,584 --> 01:26:52,610
WeII , in his passion ,
he tore off my robe. . .

1601
01:26:52,687 --> 01:26:54,450
and he threw me on the bed .

1602
01:26:54,523 --> 01:26:57,856
And Mr. Hart's pistoI
was Iying there between us.

1603
01:26:57,926 --> 01:26:58,893
And then?

1604
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,053
We both reached for the gun ,
but I got it first.

1605
01:27:01,129 --> 01:27:04,565
Then he came toward me with
this funny Iook in his eyes.

1606
01:27:04,633 --> 01:27:06,396
He was angry and wiId !

-WiId !
-WiId !

1608

Did you think
he meant to kiII you?

1609
01:27:09,771 --> 01:27:11,398
Oh , yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

1610
01:27:11,473 --> 01:27:12,906
So it was his Iife or yours?

1611
01:27:12,974 --> 01:27:14,066
And not just mine.

1612
01:27:14,142 --> 01:27:17,043
I cIosed my eyes, and I shot!

In defense of your Iife!

1614

throughout this ordeaI
