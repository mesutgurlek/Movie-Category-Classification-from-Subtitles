The first time I was in love

4
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,714
was June, 1975, in Boca Raton.

5
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,259
Her name was Coty Pierce.

6
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,306
She lived there with her parents

7
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,726
and her little sister, Karrie.

8
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,978
And I loved her, too.

9
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:05,481
I loved them both,
and they were in love with me.

10
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,401
They just didn't know it.

11

No one did.

12

I loved the expression on their faces
when they slept.

17
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,598
And then I decided to declare myself

18
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,768
and show them
how much they loved me.

I kissed their mother, too.

Smart, talented.

339
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:53,348
Something tells me he ain't choosing
them just for their congeniality.

340
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:57,727
Ordinarily, they don't.
But I think our guy is a little different.

- How so?
- I think killing is not his ulterior motive.

And nothing personal,

00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,244

is tied to a tree

347

just waiting to get found.

348
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,664
Well, think about it, Sikes.

349
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,333
The three you found were killed
out of sequence.

350

you would have found them by now.

no attempt to hide them.

is very revealing.

- That last long walk through the woods.
- Marching to their fate.

357

Exactly.
The rape, cutting off her hair...

358
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,399
- It's a punishment.
- Maybe for violating some trust.

Dr Cross, is it him? Is he bicoastal?

794
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,572
Bicoastal?

795
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,742
That's an interesting way of putting it.

796
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:07,163
There are about a dozen predators
operating in California now.

797
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:11,584
There's one, male Caucasian,
probably early 30s,

798
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:16,672
he's known as the "Gentleman Caller."
They've been on to him for over a year.

799
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:19,342
And what I realised last night
was that his abductions,

800
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:22,678
they followed the ones here
by about 10 days to two weeks.

801
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:26,599
Matter of fact, it was exactly 10 days
after Naomi disappeared

802
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,560
that a pretty, black coed
disappeared from UCLA.

803
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:33,939
- So he's doing it there, too.
- Compulsively.

804
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:37,943
And if he follows true to form,
he's due to hit California pretty quick.

805
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,695
Can the FBI pick him up?

806
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,865
If I get Rudolph to the FBI,
and they make one mistake,

807
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,117
what happens to all these girls?

808
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:48,704
I can't risk Naomi starving to death
in a cell somewhere.

809
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:53,376
- No FBI.
- You're going out there on your own.

810
01:01:54,795 --> 01:01:57,588
- I've got people.
- Take me with you.

811

by staying here right now.

813

No, no, that's not what I was gonna say.

814
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:05,388
- I just think you should return...
- Dr Cross,

815
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:07,723
I'm the only person who's seen this guy.

816

I know the way he moves...

You think I'm some kind of tourist
in all this because I wasn't raped?

820

01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,985
of that woman
whose life you saved on TV.

949
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:14,658
Okay, breathe in. How's this?

950

Mmm-hmm. (GRUNTS)

- We need X-rays.
- Not a chance.

956
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:31,299
Detective Castillo and the woman were
rushed to a nearby emergency facility

957
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:32,551
where their condition...

958

Gone in the night.

At least now the FBI know
who they're looking for.

- How far can he run?
- It's not a question of how far.

961

It's how long.

very few answers.

Questioned on the scene,
Detective John Sampson,

964
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:51,653
whom we've learned
is about 3,000 miles

965
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:53,780
- out of his jurisdiction.
- So, what do you want to do?

966
01:14:53,865 --> 01:14:55,824
Sampson is a detective
in good standing

967
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,868
with the Washington DC
Police Department.

968
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:00,287
From what local police tell us,
Sampson was part

969
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:02,330
of a ragtag surveillance team.

970
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:06,418
Sampson, Detective Castillo and
two other unidentified individuals

971
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:10,213
were on a stakeout,
but staking out whom or what?

the cabin owner is Dr William...

about making reservations

01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:17,345
from Los Angeles to Raleigh-Durham
for two people for tonight.

975
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,640
...was Dr Rudolph, a man
with no criminal record to his name...

976
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:22,184
KATE: Okay, it's the return portion...

977
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:25,729
- Hang up the phone, Kate.
- Pardon me?

978

Hang up the phone.

Welcome to our crime scene.

a little old to you by now.

- You got here quick.

- Not quick enough, wouldn't you say?
- Now, wait a minute, Kyle.

984
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,420
- Let's not downplay the upside of this.
- Upside?

985
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:53,423
Yeah, the upside. We ID'd Casanova.
You got a trail.

The day you set foot in Durham...

Look, I feel like you've been
screwing me around.

988
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,889
- Why?
- Look, I let you in.

989
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:03,683
I shared information.

990
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:08,188
What have we got? A mess, and a cop
who's looking at two years of rehab.

991
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:10,982
Kyle, do you want me to say,
"I fucked up"?

992
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:14,527
All right. I fucked up.

993
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,532
Just don't shut me out of this.

994
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,433
What do you see?

995
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,648
- Maybe I'm looking too hard.
- For what?

996

I don't know.

Keep looking.

1001
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,960
Thought the closet looked a little tight,
so I brought in a DX fluoroscope.

1002
01:17:12,044 --> 01:17:14,129
It scanned what appeared
to be a lunar module.

1003

It's a freezer.

He's Don Juan on the east coast,
Josef Mengele on the west.

- What?

You heard me. Surgically band-sawed
at the ankle, vacuum-bagged.

1009
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,604
Fifteen pair, two lefts.

1010

Man, this is the most ambitious stunt
in the annals of serial pathology.

1019
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,808
This guy is Houdini squared.

Put on brakes, now.

I've run into him now and then.

1406
01:50:11,563 --> 01:50:12,605
Go ahead.

1407
01:50:13,357 --> 01:50:16,818
Reach for the Glock and take me down
before I tell you about the 10 days

1408
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:18,695
I spent with Naomi.

1409
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:23,032
Ten days, Doc.
Things she'd never tell you.

1410
01:50:23,575 --> 01:50:26,869
My brown sugar. Face like an angel.

1411
01:50:27,705 --> 01:50:31,207
Perfect. Every inch of her.

1412
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:37,046
You never knew Naomi. Not like I did.

1413
01:50:38,424 --> 01:50:41,884
Deep down, you envy me that.

1414
01:50:43,929 --> 01:50:45,263
Say it.

1415
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:48,224
I don't work like you.

1416
01:50:49,727 --> 01:50:52,061
I don't hate.

1417
01:50:53,605 --> 01:50:56,316
You only wish you had the courage.

1418
01:50:59,778 --> 01:51:03,323
Good night, sweet Kate.

1419
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,664
(KATE SCREAMING)

1420
01:51:31,852 --> 01:51:32,935
Kate.

1421
01:51:33,687 --> 01:51:35,605
It's all right, Kate.
