00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,509
JOE: Where's Bailey?

4
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,261
Deaf and dumb, eh?

5
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,776
Can you read lips?

6
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,904
Where is Bailey?

7
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,991
Coming back today?

8
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,415
Come on.

9
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,012
- Hello, Marny.
- Well, look who is back.

10
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,764
- Did you dye your hair?
- Why?

11
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,557
I keep thinking of you as a blond.

12
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,686
For all the thinking you do about
me, I could be bald-headed.

13
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,480
Ham on rye. Did you miss me, honey?

14
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:12,525
If I didn't, I can't think
of anybody else who did.

15
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:16,028
- One thing's sure, Bailey don't miss nothing.
- Neither do you.

16
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,072
She's your girl, and
he ain't my man.

17
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:21,033
So it's no skin off my nose.
I just see what I see.

18
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,952
You sure you don't
see what you hear?

19
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,330
Nothing can happen in this town
that I don't hear about it.

20
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm just saying what I see. Every
day they go fishing together.

21
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,711
Look, the sandwich.

22
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,424
Two things I can smell inside 100 feet:
burning hamburger and a romance.

23
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,634
You got a customer.

24
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,177
- What'll you have?
- Coffee.

25
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,607
- Nothing else?
- Cream.

26
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,225
- Where you been this time?
- L.A.

27
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,102
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

28
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,730
First she's got you, now
she's got you and Bailey.

29
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,691
And the only thing I
seem to get is older.

30
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,461
Thanks a lot, Marny.
I'll see you later.

31
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,700
Hmm. I guess I must
have said something.

32
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,253
You talked enough.

33
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,747
Everything people ought to know
they just don't want to hear.

34
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,707
That's the trouble with the world.

35
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,877
Either that or you're on the
wrong side of the counter.

36
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,338
- Tell me something.
- You don't look as though I could.

37
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,759
That, uh, Bailey who burns you
up, he run the gas station?

38
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,053
- Do you know him?
- I might have once.

39
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,348
If he keeps mooning around
Jim's girl, nobody'll know him...

40
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,809
and that'd be too bad.

41
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,438
You, uh, see much of this Bailey?

42
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,441
Yeah, every day from here.

43
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,526
I often wondered what
happened to him...

44
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:42,333
then one day I'm breezing through here,
and there's his name up on a sign.

45
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:47,338
- It's a small world.
- Yeah, or a big sign.

46
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:08,405
- They're just not feeding today.
- They will later. It's clouding up.

47
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,061
They say the day you die,
your name is written on a cloud.

48
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,230
- Who says?
- They.

49
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,440
Never heard of them.

50
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,693
Nothing in that one but rain.
Think we ought to go home?

51
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,111
Yes.

52
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,961
- Do you want to?
- No.

53
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:30,037
Every time I look at the sky, I think
of all the places I've never been.

54
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,808
Yes, and every time you look
up, they're all the same.

55
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,837
- You've been a lot of places, haven't you?
- One too many.

56
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,131
- Which did you like best?
- This one right here.

57
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:45,094
- I bet you say that to all the places.
- You see that cove over there?

58
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,137
I'd like to build a
house right there...

59
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,738
marry you, live in it and
never go anywhere else.

60
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,987
I wish you would.

61
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:04,196
You were never married
before, were you?

62
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,490
Not that I can remember.

63
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,409
That's good.

64
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,537
You'd be amazed the way
people talk about you.

The mysterious Jeff Bailey.

66
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:19,587
My mother tells me that I've only
known you for such a short time.

67
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:22,266
And where'd you come from?
And what did you do?

68
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,111
My father was...

69
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,149
- We'd better go.
- Is something the matter?

70
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,202
Maybe not.

71
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,124
Here.

72
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,140
You sure are a secret man.

73
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,043
Thanks.

74
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,962
Oh, a man just wants to see me.

75
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,685
Oh.

- Hello, Joe. I wish it was nicer to see you.

00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,950
Everyone sure missed you, Jeff,
but not as much as I have.

79
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,118
- How's that?
- Whit used to look at me...

80
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,497
shake his head, and wish
I had brains like you.

81
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:40,501
- What's the other reason?
- I had to find you.

82
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,628
- I owe you something?
- Not me.

83
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,505
Who?

84
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:48,217
- How far can that kid read lips?
- I don't know. I'll ask him some time.

85
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,219
This far?

86
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,056
- You don't like to make mistakes, do you?
- They don't let me have many.

87
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,610
All right, come on inside.

88
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,776
- Funny racket to find you in, Jeff.
- Yeah, me and the kid laugh all the time.

89
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,487
Heh. I guess that's
because it's respectable.

90
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,532
That hash slinger across the
street says you are too.

91
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,285
- How did you happen to find me, Joe?
- I was driving down the road one day...

92
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:20,457
and who do I see pumping gasoline
but my old chum from the old times.

93
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,793
Of course, there's a
different name on the sign.

94
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,546
- So you just dropped in?
- Why not?

95
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:28,674
Okay, then I'm glad to
see an old pal too.

96
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:32,636
So I take you to dinner, buy you
drinks, it gets late chewing the fat...

97
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,055
you hop in your car and
you're gone. Right?

98
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,975
- Almost.
- What else?

99
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,269
I'm still working
for that guy, Jeff.

- Whit?
- He'd like to see you.

101
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,274
- As much as you did?
- Heh.

102
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,360
- Worse.
- I see.

103
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,738
No one ever thought
more of you than Whit.

104
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,197
Or more about me.

105
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,784
Well, that could be too.

106
00:08:55,785 --> 00:09:00,247
- All right, what's he want, Joe?
- Maybe he's got something nice for you.

107
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,999
- Try once more.
- Heh.

108
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,586
Look, Whit never steered you
into anything bad, did he?

109
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:09,339
Why, he never even squawked when you
blew the best thing he ever gave you.

110
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,510
- Go on.
- The guy just wants to see you.

111
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,596
Well, you put it that
way, what can I do?

112
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,525
You know of any other
way to put it?

113
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,979
- Say tomorrow morning?
- Where?

114

Lake Tahoe. Turn right at Emerald Bay.
Big house on a hill. You won't miss it.

WOMAN: Ann? John, are you
letting her out like this?

118
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:02,656
Are you gonna stand for it, with a
man who won't even come to the door?

119
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,240
Don't worry about them.

120
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,827
- Darling.
- It's no good, is it?

121
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:15,364
- It doesn't matter. It's just that they...
- Oh, honey, I know how they feel.

122
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,158
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm not.

123
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,287
- Then don't look so grim.
- No, it's something else.

- What?
- That guy that showed up today...

125
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,668
Yes?

126
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,753
You want to ride with
me up to Lake Tahoe?

127

- Now?
- Yes, now.

128
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,549
I want to tell you something.

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,676
All right, Jeff.

130
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:38,637
You told me once I'd have
to tell you sometime.

00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,691
Well, this is it.

132
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:01,785
Now, the first thing I wanna get off my
chest: My name isn't Bailey, it's Markham.

133
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:06,415
- Markham. Jeff Markham?
- I should have told you before.

134
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,043
I meant to, but I kept
putting it off...

135
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,838
because I didn't
like any part of it.

136
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,133
- Please tell me, Jeff.
- Some of it's gonna hurt you.

137
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,552
It doesn't matter.

138
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:22,181
Well, our friend Markham
lived in New York.

139
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:26,894
He worked with a sort of stupid,
oily gent by the name of Jack Fisher.

140
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,314
We called ourselves detectives.

141
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,942
That was about three
years ago, maybe more.

142
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:38,655
Wintertime. One of the coldest
days I remember in the town.

143
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,991
And we got a call to
come and see a big op.

144
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:44,786
- A what?
- An operator, gambler.

145
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:48,707
He didn't come to see us because he
was too high-powered a character.

146
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:53,170
Also, because some dame had taken
four shots at him with his own .38.

147
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,769
Made one of them good.

148
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:03,180
He was taking it in stride, but he
had a friend who was a ball of fire.

149
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:07,267
Newspaper guys, wise guys, who
do they think they're kidding?

150
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,686
So he shot himself
cleaning a cap pistol.

151
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,106
So I shot the ace of spades out
of a sleeve during a gin game.

152
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,108
A guy can't even get
shot by a dame...

I didn't tell him.

"I wish you were here."

ever show up? I didn't.

What stopped her from taking a boat
to Chile or Guatemala? Nothing.

get to be? I was finding out.

- No more than I would my eyes.

- Let's go to my place.

mentioned her place or going there.

Maybe she'd decided something, or it was
because the sky looked full of rain.

- Wherever it takes us.
- Why?

To make a life for ourselves, to get
away from Whit. He knows I'm here.

- Tomorrow.

- Let's find out.

have played it differently.

00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:08,777
WHIT: You're wrong.

451
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,697
I fire people, but nobody quits me.

452
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,376
You started this and you'll end it.

453
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,995
Besides, Joe couldn't find
a prayer in the Bible.

454
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,414
You'll find her. Take it easy.

455
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,792
Take your time. Well, better
get back to the airport.

456
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,336
Good luck, Jeff.

457
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,264
See you someday.

458
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,847
JEFF: It wasn't all a lie
because she did take a steamer.

459
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,600
It was just that it went
north instead of south.

460
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,949
And I was on it too.

461
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,448
I opened an office
in San Francisco.

462
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,151
A cheap little rat hole
that suited the work I did.

463
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,196
Shabby jobs for who'd ever hire me.

464
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:57,048
It was the bottom of the barrel,
and I scraped it, but I didn't care.

465
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,512
I had her.

466
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,331
JEFF:
We kept pretty much to ourselves.

467
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:04,959
We found a little movie
house in North Beach.

468
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,629
We were on the run. We went to places
we never would've seen in our lives.

469
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,507
And after a while, we grew a
little more sure of ourselves.

470
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:16,095
We drifted back to more familiar
places, ballparks and the racetracks.

471
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:21,402
Why not? After all, there wasn't one chance
in a million we'd bump into our past.

472
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,826
One chance in a million.

473
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,693
One chance in a million was all that chump
ever had in his life, and he made it good.

474
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:34,363
He stood there with our lives in his
pocket, because I knew if he saw her...

475
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:37,417
he'd sell us both for $1.95.

476
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,965
So we had to separate.

477
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:45,082
I went alone to L.A., and I made
it easy for him to follow me.

478
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,104
He was a good gumshoe. It was the
one thing he could really do.

479
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,880
So I went everywhere like a
guy enjoying the country.

480
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,717
I didn't write to her
or phone or telegraph.

481
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,927
I just waited and moved.

482
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,347
When it seemed right, I blew out
of town to go and meet her.

483
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:04,824
I wasn't bad at the game myself. I was sure
I had shaken him loose, and I felt good.

484
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,997
Fisher was back there somewhere,
and I could see her again.

485
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,491
We'd arranged to meet at a little cabin
off the highway on Pyramid Creek.

486
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,869
It was dark when I
was getting there.

487
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,923
And then I saw her walking up
the road in the headlights.

488
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:34,934
- JEFF: You want a lift, babe?
- Well, I really hadn't ought.

489
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,428
JEFF: You're a cute little package
to be out walking alone at night.

490
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,306
You're kind of cute yourself
to be walking alone any night.

491
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:43,984
That does it.

492
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:52,232
JEFF: It was meeting her
somewhere, like in the first times.

493
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,943
There was still that something
about her that got me.

494
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,417
A kind of magic or whatever it was.

495
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,756
Well, I held her, and we could laugh
because we were together again.

496
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:05,134
We'd played it smart
and forgotten nothing.

497
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,873
Forgotten nothing except one thing.

00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,885

Don't I get introduced?

I don't blame you, Jeff.

503
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,957
Maybe I'd have lied my head
off just like you did.

504

Your picture don't do
you justice, baby.

505
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,414
- Why don't you break his head, Jeff?
- Cute.

506
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:51,917
Whit should've got her back. As I
understand, they deserve each other.

- You working for him now?
- Who else would he get to find my partner?

508
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,020
All right, Fisher,
what's the pitch?

509
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,884
You and I had a little deal, Jeff.

510
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,304
Ten grand and expenses,
fifty-fifty.

511
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,808
Remember? You used to have a good
memory. Whatever happened to it?

512
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,227
- I didn't collect.
- Not the 10 grand.

513
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:14,356
I can give you a tip. You tell Whit where
we are, he might slip you a sawbuck.

514
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,954
KATHIE: Jeff.

515
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,068
He isn't going to
tell Whit anything.

516
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:22,656
Sure not. You just come up with that
40 grand, and we're all pals again.

517
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,493
- I might even cut you in for a piece of it.
- There isn't any 40 grand.

518
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,495
Of course Whit's broad-minded.

519
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,914
He don't care about a few
slugs in the stomach...

520

dame went off with...

or even Jeff pretending
he fell down on the job.

522
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:40,924
But you and Jeff ganging up
together, he might not like that.

523
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,273
Tell him, Kathie.

524
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,596
Sure, I shot him.

525
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,570
I'm not sorry about that.

526
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,571
But I didn't take his money.

- Beat it.
- FISHER: Look at all the angles.

528

You know Whit and you know
how far he can reach.

529

So just pay me off and
I'm quiet, but use cash.

I wasn't sorry for
him or sore at her.

had happened was done.

Yeah, but you should've
known about it long ago.

- Well, it is.

00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:48,088
It's very simple. I sell gasoline.
I make a small profit.

00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:51,008
With that I buy groceries,
the grocer makes a profit.

It's a nice view.
Am I here to admire it?

00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,137
I always liked you.

583
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:31,006
You liked me because you could use me.
You could use me because I was smart.

584
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,216
I'm not smart anymore.
I run a gas station.

585
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,010
I like the view.

586
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,887
Can you still listen?

587
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,638
I can hear.

588
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,599
Well, you told me
about your business.

589
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,603
Well, mine is a little more precarious,
and I earn considerably more.

590
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,021
So I've heard.

591
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,856
So has the government.

592
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:50,942
Well, this may sound ridiculous,
but you could pay them.

593
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:54,029
- That would be against my nature.
- All right, forget I said it.

594
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:58,617
So I collaborated with a certain
man who understands these things.

595
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,994
He saved me quite a bit
of money, $1 million.

596
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:05,624
I didn't particularly trust him, so
I paid him well, but he's unhappy.

597
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:08,543
- He wants more money.
- Well, he saved you a lot.

598
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:12,422
Oh, I appreciate it. I always
remember what any man did for me.

599
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,840
Or didn't.

600
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,969
Perhaps. The point is that
now he wants 200,000.

601
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,932
Or he could get 10 percent of the million
from the government, if he turns you in.

602
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,892
You're up on these things.

603
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:27,729
- Has he got anything to trade?
- Well, he has the income tax records.

604
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,900
But I don't see why I should buy them
when I might persuade you to get them.

605
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,777
- Then I'd have them.
- I know.

606
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,403
But I can trust you.

607
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,948
You know, I don't think
you can trust anybody.

608
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,450
You better go in there
and get them yourself.

609
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,078
- I'd rather you did it.
- I pass.

610
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,496
You don't like it?

611
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,207
No, I just can't get
away from my business.

612
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,668
Well, it's a nice view.

613
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,767
Let's have some breakfast.

614
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:01,151
WHIT:
You remember Kathie, don't you?

615
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,659
Yeah, I remember Kathie.

616
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,354
Sit down.

617
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,190
Kathie's back in the fold now.

618
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,694
- You're back in the fold too, Jeff.
- I see what you mean.

619
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:18,113
You see, Jeff, you
owe me something.

620
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:20,633
You'll never be happy until
you square yourself.

621
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,669
Did you bare your
heart to him, Kathie?

622
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,888
I couldn't help it, Jeff.

623
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,250
- Well, that settles things.
- Does it?

624
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,085
You're working for me.

625
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,838
This man I told you about,
his name is Leonard Eels...

626
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,798
but, uh, you won't
go to him directly.

627
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,342
He has a secretary that
he's rather fond of.

628
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,387
Her name is Meta Carson.
You'll find her charming.

629
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,531
She may even find you charming.

630
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,017
I understand that women have.

631
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:49,412
She'll tell you how it's lined up.

632
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,282
You, uh, know San
Francisco, don't you?

633
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,443
Yeah, I was there once at a party.

634
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,213
- WHIT: Then you get around.
- Like the monkey and the weasel.

635
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,550
We'll put you on a
train this afternoon.

636
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:07,305
- Right now, I'd like to get some sleep.
- WHIT: Find Joe. He'll show you to your room.

637
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:10,665
And don't start worrying.

638
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,639
Why should I?

639
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:33,622
(DOORKNOB CLICKING)

640
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,536
Jeff, I had to come back.
What else could I do?

641
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,196
You can never help
anything, can you?

642
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:45,627
You're like a leaf that the wind
blows from one gutter to another.

643
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,079
You can't help anything
you do, even murder.

644
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,332
- You can't say it was that.
- I can say one thing. I buried him.

645
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:55,762
- What did you tell him? About us?
- Uh...

646
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,800
- But you couldn't help it, could you?
- He looked right into me and he knew it.

647
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,843
- How much?
- What, Jeff?

648
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,263
About Fisher. Did he look
into you for that too?

649
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:08,441
No, I didn't tell that.

650
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:11,142
- Don't lie to me.
- I didn't.

651
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,187
I wouldn't tell him that.
I wouldn't tell anyone that.

652
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,439
I swear it, Jeff. Believe me.

653
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,608
Sure. Sure, I believe you.

654
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,610
I didn't know what to do.

655
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,446
I was always afraid of him
and afraid of what I'd done.

656
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,533
I couldn't live that way
anymore. I couldn't stand it.

657
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,618
Oh, Jeff, I've missed you.

658
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:32,122
I've wondered about you and
prayed you'd understand.

659
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,540
Can you understand?

660
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,343
You prayed, Kathie?

661
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,644
Can't you even feel sorry for me?

662
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,171
- I'm not going to try.
- Jeff...

663
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:43,521
Look, just get out, will you?
I have to sleep in this room.

664
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:49,865
Let's just leave it where
it all is. Get out.

(DOOR CLOSES)

666
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,730
- Meta Carson?
- Yes.

667
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,784
- My name is Bailey.
- Come in.

668
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,864
- I was expecting you.
- Well, I wasn't expecting you.

669
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,201
- Should I take that as a compliment?
- Whit told me you'd be charming.

670
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,578
Really? Would you
like a gin and tonic?

671
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,122
- That'd be nice.
- You may have whiskey, if you like.

672
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,425
That'd be even nicer.

673
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,728
Miserable weather
we're having, isn't it?

674
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:09,688
- Are you acquainted with San Francisco?
- We were quite intimate.

675
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,680
- Indeed?
- We lived together.

676
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,516
It's a nice apartment
you have here.

677
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:18,061
Yes, these old houses can be amusing
when they're remodeled, can't they?

678
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,688
I used to live in one in
New York that was old.

679
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,357
It wasn't very amusing.

680
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:26,027
- I've never been to New York.
- You take a trip there sometime.

681
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,947
You'll see one reason why
I'm in San Francisco.

682
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,698
Whit said you'd tell me the other.

683
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:34,911
You know, you're rather charming yourself,
but I'm afraid I don't quite understand you.

684
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,038
If you'll drop this
Junior League patter...

685
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,762
we may get the conversation
down where it belongs.

686
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:43,336
- You worried about something?
- I don't know. Should I be?

687
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:47,507
- Not if you do what you're told.
- That's why I'm here. I do what I'm told.

688
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:51,553
People trust me. Whit even
trusts me twice. Do you?

689
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:54,152
Just as far as I have to.

690
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:57,851
Can you find your way
to 114 Fulton Street?

691
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,853
- When?
- Tonight.

692
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:03,356
I'll be there in the apartment of
an attorney named Leonard Eels.

693
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,025
You can call for me
at 8 and look around.

694
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:09,362
I can depend on that.
We'll leave together.

695
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,865
In a day or so, he'll
take some papers home.

696
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,366
I'll let you know.

697
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,702
Then you get them.
He won't be there.

698
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:17,203
Where will he be?

699
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:20,665
With me. I'm his secretary.

700
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,085
- Well, it sounds simple enough.
- It is.

701
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,356
- Like two and two make four.
- That's right.

702
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:35,280
Just remember, I'm coming out of
this in one piece, Miss Carson.

703
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:39,058
Do you always go around leaving your
fingerprints on a girl's shoulder?

704
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:44,115
Not that I mind particularly.
You've got nice strong hands.

705

- Jeff.
- Petey, how are you?

706
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,750
Where you been? You
marry an honest dame?

707
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:07,420
- I went in the gasoline business.
- But you're looking for me now, ain't you?

708
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,975
I went out of business. Come on,
let's take a ride in your hack.

Buddy, you look like
you're in trouble.

710
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,276
- Why?
- Because you don't act like it.

00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,071
I think I'm in a frame.

712

Don't sound like you.

713
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:27,732
I don't know. All I
can see is the frame.

714
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,068
I'm going in there now
to look at the picture.

715
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:33,873
- I don't have to tell you to wait.

META: Hello, Jeffrey.

722
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:23,371
I always wanted my favorite
cousin to meet my favorite boss.

723
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,373
- LEONARD: Apple martini?
- Thanks.

724
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:28,501
Meta talked about you like you're
the ninth wonder of the world.

725
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,753
- She skipped one.
- Meta must be the eighth.

726
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,716
All women are wonders because they
reduce all men to the obvious.

727
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,940
META: And so do martinis.

728
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,013
So nice here, I hate to go.

729
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:42,942
Don't then. Why don't you
both stay and have dinner?

730
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,517
Yes, why don't we?

731
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,604
We can't, Jeffrey. We promised
the Bigelows, remember?

732
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,897
JEFF: Oh, call them up.
We can see them anytime.

733
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,066
We can't, Jeffrey.
I'm sorry, Leonard.

734
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,120
Some other time. How long will
you be in town, Mr. Bailey?

735
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,448
- I don't really know.
- LEONARD: You're on business?

736
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:01,753
- You might call it that.
- Where are you from? The South?

737
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:06,414
- No. Tahoe.
- We must go, Jeff.

738
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:08,388
JEFF: All right.

739
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,339
Your, uh, cousin is a
very charming young lady.

740
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,611
No, he isn't. His name is Norman and
he's a bookmaker in Cleveland, Ohio.

741
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,556
- Where did you say you were from?
- Tahoe...

where we worry as much about
the income tax as anybody.

743
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,063
Frankly, you don't make sense.

744
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,440
Neither does my being her cousin...

745
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:34,859
or my being brought up here...

746
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,986
to, uh, leave my
fingerprints around.

747
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,030
On the other hand, maybe it does.

748
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:42,200
You know, it could be that I'm the
patsy, and you're on the spot.

01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:11,722
Well, we meet in all
kinds of places.

903
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:20,679
That evens this. Fold your
hands, or I'll do it for you.

904
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,108
You talk big, mister.

905
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:35,360
- All right, wise guy.
- I wouldn't.

906
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,696
I told you. I'm tired of
getting pushed around.

907
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:40,824
You'll only get yourself out
of breath. Won't he, Joe?

908
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,409
Cut it, Lou.

909
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:45,704
Your move now is to do a little
thinking. A little talking.

910
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,999
See, I've got the files that
were in your briefcase.

911
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,585
I also know the address of
the Treasury Department.

912
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:55,088
That's the theory, isn't it? Keep the
files away from the treasury boys.

913
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,507
Save Whit from doing 10
years in a federal pen.

914
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:01,345
- Now, you correct me if I make a mistake.
- We may do that.

915
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:05,140
Sure. Of course, the government may
just pat Whit on the back and say:

916
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:09,144
"Go on home. We got all the dough we need.
We'll never miss your million dollars."

917
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,605
You wanna lay a price on that?

918
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:13,658
How did you know I
had the briefcase?

919
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,361
JEFF: I had Meta tailed.

920
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:20,322
You sure about that?

921
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:23,909
Look, I don't have to be sure
about anything except the files.

922
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:27,430
Now, do you wanna talk business,
or do you wanna play house?

923
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,165
What's your idea?

924
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,335
You get the files, and you
also get Eels' body...

925
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:35,796
in case you wanna keep
it from the cops.

926
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,940
What do you want?

927
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:42,612
I want the affidavit that Meta put in
Eels' safe when she took the files out.

928
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:47,491
A lie that somebody put on paper that
I killed a guy named Jack Fisher.

929
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,777
Because, you see,
I only buried him.

930
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:52,655
And you don't get the gas
for being the undertaker.

931
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,024
Four of us knew about that
affidavit outside of Whit.

932
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,077
Somebody talked.

933
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:07,128
- Did Meta tell you?
- No.

934
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,589
Sorry.

935
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,750
- Put in a call for Whit Sterling...
- No, sit down.

936
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,962
- We better keep Whit out of this.
- He's right, Kathie.

937
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:20,799
Oh, you've hurt her feelings, Lou.
I can tell you, she's a sensitive girl.

938
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,885
- I'm kind of sensitive myself.
- And you won't need Whit.

939
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:27,347
All you'll need is Meta to unlock
that safe in Eels' office.

940
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:30,225
- I hope Meta's still around.
- She's around.

941
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,853
Good. Then you can start right now.

942
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:36,982
I'll call you in about an hour. That'll
give you time to find her and get there.

943
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:40,402
Give you a little extra time to
figure out how you're gonna cross me.

944
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,455
But you won't.

945
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:49,219
(SIREN WAILING)

946
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,166
JOE:
Will you bust this for me, Jackson?

947
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:38,014
Sure.

948
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:43,715
That's right. Whit Sterling
at the Blue Sky Club in Reno.

949
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:47,771
- Shut the door.
- Don't forget, those dames listen in.

950
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:52,191
(PHONE RINGS)

951
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:54,351
- Hello?
- WOMAN: Mr. Sterling?

952
01:11:54,352 --> 01:11:55,727
- Speaking.
- WOMAN: One moment.

953
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,522
- Thank you.
- WOMAN: Go ahead.

954
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:01,691
- Whit, darling, this is Kathie.
- WHIT: Everything all right?

955
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,735
- No.
- WHIT: Seldom is.

956
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,363
I think you'd better stay
where you are for a while.

957
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:09,366
- Well, could you tell me why?
- KATHIE: I can't talk now.

958
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,201
Things are mixed up.

959
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,911
Bailey mix them?

960
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:15,580
KATHIE: I can't talk on the phone.
We're trying to get a plane.

961
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,833
But you're bringing me something?

962
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:22,295
KATHIE: No, Whit. I can't explain now,
darling. I just wanted to tell you.

963
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:25,006
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

964
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,676
- Like what, honey?
- KATHIE: Don't go to Tahoe.

965
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:31,402
Be careful and wait in
Reno for me. Goodbye.

966
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:42,649
- You look like I might be in trouble.
- You will be if we don't find Bailey.

967
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,373
I might be if I do.

Five-year-old murder

- is hunted for two murders."
- I knew he was no good.

975
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:42,208
I said all along, "There's a man
who should be run out of town."

976
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:46,421
Look at that. Police are
hunting him for two murders.

Checking all cars. That is all.

981
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,861
- Hi, Jim.
- Hello, Ed. You talked to the kid yet?

982
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,238
He's gone. The station's
locked up tight.

983
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,700
- Gone where?
- Maybe with Bailey.

984
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:18,870
Well, that doesn't make sense.
If you had the law on your tail...

985
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,915
would you let a guy working for
you come up to chew the fat?

986
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:25,470
I'd want a partner,
if I could get him.

987
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:28,672
- Ed?
- ED: Yeah?

988
01:14:28,673 --> 01:14:30,256
Our attention.

989
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:34,094
Says, "Bailey took a plane to L.A.
last night. No trace since."

990
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:36,179
Says, "May be headed this way."

991
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,948
Okay.

992
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:42,282
Would you consider it too dumb
for him to try to hole up here?

993
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:45,105
He'll come here. And when
he does, I'll know it.

994
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:47,249
See you.

995
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:56,032
- What's he mean, he'll know it?
- What do you suppose? Ann Miller.

996
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:59,337
Me? I'll take the kid.

997
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,975
You all right, Ann?

998
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:16,771
I know what you're going to say,
and I don't wanna hear it.

Jeff didn't kill anybody.

1000
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:21,359
He told me everything.

1001
01:15:21,684 --> 01:15:24,112
Has he got you mixed up in this?

1002
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:27,564
- Has he?
- Whatever he's mixed up in, I am too.

1003
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:30,191
Well, I'm not going to stand
by and see him hurt you.

1004
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,819
- If he comes back here...
- What'll you do?

1005
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,613
- You won't go to the police.
- I don't know what I'll do.

1006
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:37,115
No, Jimmy.

1007
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:40,215
Do you expect me to
help him get away?

1008
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:42,509
Jim.

1009
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:52,435
JOE: He can read your lips.

1010
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,843
Mr. Sterling is fishing.

1011
01:15:56,844 --> 01:15:59,512
No. In the high mountains.

1012
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:02,015
Tell Jeff we're sending for him.

1013
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:04,489
Where can we reach you?

1014
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:16,293
Joe will find you at the
station when we have word.

1015
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:29,292
I'm not so sure this
is a bright idea.

1016
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:32,597
You think of a brighter one on
the way, come back with it.

Who'd you see? Sterling?

1020
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:28,717
Kathie?

1021
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:35,056
Cute kids, aren't they?

1022
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:07,129
What are you scared about?

1023
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:12,048
Joe isn't coming back. He got
careless and fell in the river.

1024
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:16,209
Didn't you hear what I said?
Joe's dead, Kathie.

1025
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:19,229
Can't you find some tears for him?

1026
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:23,174
- Come on.
- What are you gonna do?

1027
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,426
Talk to Whit. Don't
you think I should?

1028
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:29,138
Yes, of course you should. He wants
to see you. He's waiting for you.

1029
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:32,100
With his fishing rod? You
told the kid he was fishing.

1030
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:34,852
He, uh, came back
late this afternoon.

1031
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:37,480
I'll bet he's pacing up and
down, worrying about Joe.

1032
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:42,318
- You think I sent Joe?
- Oh, you're wonderful, Kathie.

1033
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:46,406
- All right. Where is the gentleman?
- Downstairs. In the library, I think.

1034
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:49,284
Jeff, don't let him trick you.

1035
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:51,911
He'll pay anything you ask.
He'll do anything you ask.

1036
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:54,886
Sure he will. Anything.

1037
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:02,297
If only there was some
way about Fisher.

1038
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:04,396
There is.

1039
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,237
(FOOTSTEPS)

1040
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:19,564
Well, you getting things in
shape for the treasury boys?

1041
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:23,460
Hello, Jeff. I've been
sort of expecting you.

1042
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,363
Well, let's get down to business.
Start all over again, right?

1043
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:31,117
- You have some papers of mine.
- All right, you take the frame off me.

1044
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:33,637
You pin the Eels murder on Joe.

1045
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:37,599
Sure. Sure.

1046
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:40,668
I get a modest settlement. Say...

1047
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,670
Oh, say 50,000.

1048
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:46,396
That should be enough for me to
spend my waning years in Mazatlán.

1049
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,844
Not Acapulco because I'd keep
thinking about you, Kathie.

1050
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,847
Up there in the women's
prison in Tehachapi.

1051
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:56,243
It won't be too bad. Hills all
around you, plenty of sun.

1052
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,645
You make me nervous.

1053
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:04,067
You'll be happier if you let the cops
have her. That's what you'll have to do.

1054
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:08,196
Somebody's gotta take the rap for
Fisher's murder. It's not gonna be me.

1055
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,198
Wait a minute.

1056
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:13,719
- I'm not framing any woman.
- JEFF: When did you reform?

1057
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,718
I wouldn't try it, Whit.
You're out of shape.

1058
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:20,375
- Besides, it's not a frame. She shot him.
- He was gonna kill you.

1059
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:24,462
See, Whit? Self-defense. A cinch to beat.
She might not even have to do time.

1060
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:28,609
- I'll say you killed him. They'll believe me.
- Do you believe her?

1061
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,817
Go on, Kathie, tell him about Joe.

1062
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,014
What about Joe? Where is he?

1063
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:37,934
Last time I saw him, he was
in the East Walker River.

1064
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:41,660
I didn't send him after Jeff.
It was his own idea.

1065
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:46,943
- Did you kill him?
- He slipped and fell.

1066
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:50,696
When I got there, it was too
late. That's a mean river.

1067
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:52,115
WHIT: He was trailing you?

1068
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:54,700
Well, you don't go fishing
with a .45 in your hand.

1069
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:57,453
But stop worrying about it.
It makes everything simple.

1070
01:21:57,454 --> 01:22:01,374
A dead man? Fish him out. Stick
a note in his pocket. Suicide.

1071
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:04,627
He couldn't stand living
with what he had done.

1072
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:08,148
Don't look so stricken, Whit.
You'll get over it. I did.

1073
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:11,773
But you talk it out if you want
to. I'll be waiting in there.

1074
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,678
Oh, one thing, Kathie:

1075
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,014
Did it take much persuasion to
make you say I killed Fisher?

1076
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:21,227
Come on. Feed my ego.
Tell me he beat you.

1077
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:24,577
Tell me he had to drag
every word out of you.

1078
01:22:24,857 --> 01:22:28,818
- Well, that's the way it is.
- You said you were going.

1079
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:30,871
Get out.

1080
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:50,131
You dirty little phony.
Go on, lie some more.

1081
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:52,842
Tell me how you handled things
for me in San Francisco.

1082
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:55,052
Tell me it was all Joe's
idea. Go on, Kathie.

1083
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:57,847
Show me how you're gonna
squirm your way out this time.

1084
01:22:57,848 --> 01:23:00,850
- Listen...
- What a sucker you must think I am.

1085
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:04,520
I took you back when you came
whimpering and crawling.

1086
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:07,440
I should have kicked your teeth in.

1087
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:10,693
No, I'm not going to.

1088
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:14,947
Not now, Kathie. We'll let
the law push you around.

1089
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:16,866
- You can't.
- You're wrong.

1090
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:19,076
You're gonna take the
rap and play along.

1091
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,996
You're gonna make every
exact move I tell you.

1092
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,499
If you don't, I'll kill you.

1093
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,335
And I'll promise you one
thing: It won't be quick.

1094
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,420
I'll break you first.

1095
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:33,466
You won't be able to answer a phone or
open a door without thinking, "This is it."

1096
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:37,303
And when it comes,
it still won't be quick.

1097
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:39,527
And it won't be pretty.

1098
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:43,527
You can take your choice.

1099
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:45,863
KATHIE: Whit.

1100
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:08,334
I have to go to Reno for
your money. Where's the file?

1101
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:10,933
JEFF: It'll be mailed to you.

1102
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:14,353
I crossed you once. I know better
than to try it a second time.

1103
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:18,010
I've got a reason for
wanting to be let alone.

1104
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,814
You'll get the file,
after I'm out of reach.

1105
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,934
Well, if that's the
way it has to be.

1106
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:28,187
While you're in Reno, find a pilot
who can keep his mouth shut.

1107
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:31,691
Tell him to set his plane down in
the desert where he won't be seen.

1108
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,734
Make it about dawn.

1109
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:36,696
And cheer up, Kathie.
You'll get out of it all right.

1110
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:39,170
You always have.

1111
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,458
- They say you killed a man.
- Do you believe them?

1112
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:34,503
- Not until you tell me.
- You believe everything I say, don't you?

1113
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:37,506
Everything you say
to me, I believe.

1114
01:25:37,507 --> 01:25:40,310
I don't know why I do this.

1115
01:25:40,636 --> 01:25:43,804
I don't know why I let you come
back into my life. Why I don't...

1116
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:47,183
slap your face and send
you home. I don't know.

1117
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:50,436
- Because you said you'd come back.
- But not like this.

1118
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:53,707
- You didn't kill him, did you?
- No.

1119
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:56,914
You know, I had to come back.

1120
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:05,010
- Take me with you, Jeff.
- I have to play this alone.

1121
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:09,622
- You've seen her again?
- Yeah, I saw her.

1122
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:13,268
- Was it the same?
- I saw her, and it was nothing.

1123
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:17,171
She can't be all bad. No one is.

1124
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,840
Well, she comes the closest.

1125
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:22,843
- Are you going to see her again?
- Tonight, for the last time.

1126
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:25,930
Then look at her.
And look at yourself.

1127
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:31,237
And be very sure that there isn't
even a little bit of love left for her.

1128
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:36,691
Then when you find out and you
know it once and forever...

1129
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:38,693
send for me.

1130
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:42,498
I don't have to find out.
I know it now.

1131
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:48,119
- That's all I wanted to hear.
- You know, maybe I was wrong...

1132
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:51,580
and luck is like love. You have
to go all the way to find it.

1133
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:53,666
You do to keep it.

1134
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:56,627
You better go. Did the
kid do what I told him?

1135
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:59,672
They're following him south,
the state police and all of them.

1136
01:26:59,673 --> 01:27:01,225
Good.

1137
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,770
I can't go.

1138
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:27,626
- You can put that away.
- JEFF: I can't think of a better place to put it.

1139
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:32,538
- I just want to tell you something.
- Tell it.

1140
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:34,307
I was going to kill you.

1141
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,219
- Who isn't?
- Or tell the cops where you were.

1142
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,181
I followed Ann tonight.

1143
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:45,968
- What stopped you?
- Some things you said to her.

1144
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:49,764
- You said were gonna tell me something.
- I grew up with her.

1145
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:52,558
I've loved her ever since
I fixed her roller skates.

1146
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:55,853
I don't know whether I'm good enough
for her, but I know you aren't.

1147
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:59,106
That's one difference. The
other is that she loves me.

1148
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:02,693
You told her you didn't know why you
let her back into your dirty life.

1149
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:06,197
I don't know what got you where you
are or where it's gonna take you.

1150
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:08,671
She's not going with it.

1151
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:11,869
Why don't you say it to the law.

1152
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:15,390
Then all the rest of your life
you can tell her how you did it.

1153
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:05,394
KATHIE: You can't make deals
with a dead man, Jeff.

1154
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:08,105
No, you can't.

1155
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:17,309
- Let's get out of here.
- There's someplace left to go?

1156
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:20,955
- I think so.
- You're running the show now?

1157
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:26,752
Do you mind, Jeff?

1158
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:33,534
Remember the mountains? Higher than
these and always snow on them.

1159
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:37,663
- We should have stayed there.
- I'm trying to remember something else.

1160
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:40,207
I never told you I was
anything but what I am.

1161
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,501
You just wanted to imagine I was.

1162
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:46,005
That's why I left you.
Now we're back to stay.

1163
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:49,884
- And I have nothing to say about it?
- Well, have you?

1164
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:53,721
Whit's dead. A bundle of
papers isn't any good.

1165
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:57,182
If Joe was around, you could
use him, but Joe's dead too.

1166
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:59,643
So, what are you gonna do
about Eels and Fisher?

1167
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:02,187
For that matter, what are
you gonna do about this?

1168
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:04,398
Someone has to take the blame.

1169
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:08,954
You have nothing on me, but I'd make
a fine witness for the prosecution.

1170
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:13,834
Don't you see? You've only
me to make deals with now.

1171
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:17,383
- Well, build my gallows high, baby.
- No.

1172
01:30:17,871 --> 01:30:21,916
No, we're starting all over.
I wanna go back to Mexico.

1173
01:30:21,917 --> 01:30:25,002
I wanna walk out of the sun
again and find you waiting.

1174
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:29,173
I wanna sit in the same moonlight and tell
you all the things I never told you...

1175
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:33,093
until you don't hate me.
Until sometime you love again.

1176
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:36,221
They'll always be looking for us.
They won't stop till we die.

1177
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:39,822
I don't care. Just so
they find us together.

1178
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:44,980
If you're thinking of anyone
else, don't. It wouldn't work.

1179
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:47,483
You're no good for anyone but me.

1180
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,661
You're no good and neither am I.

1181
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:52,880
That's why we deserve each other.

1182
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:00,454
Did he get the plane?

1183
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:03,916
- Where is it?
- I'm running the show, don't forget.

1184
01:31:03,917 --> 01:31:06,210
I doubt you'll ever let me.
Where's the money?

1185
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:10,436
- Upstairs.
- Better pack a couple of bags and get it.

1186
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:16,195
- Put a few things in for me.
- I have.

1187
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:07,187
Thanks.

1188
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,489
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)

1189
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:12,460
Do you remember La Mar Azul?

1190
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:16,071
If I remember, you were a very
clumsy flirt, but I liked that.

1191
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:18,466
We owe it all to José Rodriguez.

1192
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:23,259
I wonder if he'll ever know
what a bad guide he really was.

1193
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:27,750
Jeff, we've been wrong a
lot and unlucky a long time.

1194
01:32:27,751 --> 01:32:30,600
I think we deserve a break.

1195
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:33,881
We deserve each other.

1196
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:35,183
(GLASS BREAKS)

1197
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:08,349
KATHIE: Hurry, Jeff.

1198
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:21,278
(ENGINE STALLING)

1199
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:28,528
(ENGINE STARTS)

1200
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:55,847
Dirty, double-crossing rat!

1201
01:33:58,007 --> 01:33:59,934
(GUNSHOT)

1202
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,904
Sorry.

1203
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:52,227
Too many people. Too much talk.

1204
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:54,563
Maybe that's why I like this town.

1205
01:34:54,564 --> 01:34:57,913
Here, three people
are really a crowd.

1206
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:02,571
Let's get in the car and
get away from them.

1207
01:35:02,572 --> 01:35:05,616
I won't talk to you, Ann.
I just wanna be with you.

1208
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:09,046
Thanks, Jim, but I can't.

1209
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,935
You can tell me. You knew
him better than I did.

1210
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:26,028
Was he going away with her?

1211
01:35:27,096 --> 01:35:29,524
I have to know.

1212
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:33,278
Was he going away with her?

1213
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:43,021
