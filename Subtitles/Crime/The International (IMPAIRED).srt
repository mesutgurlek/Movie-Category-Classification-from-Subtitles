Listen, I'm from the bronx,

Why is the bank buying all
this missile-guidance stuff

00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:20,712
From Calvini?

You came to us,
remember?

12
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,978
You wanted a way out and now
I'm here offering you one.

I only met you
30 minutes ago,

just to walk away

I know,

Put my life
in your hands.

17
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,391
You want a little more time
to think things through,

18
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:24,459
I get it.

19

But we're gonna need
another meet.

20
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,615
And I'm gonna need
to see some paper.

He's real enough
to blow this thing wide open.

He told me the bank's buying
$200 million worth

Yeah, yeah. Listen,
we're gonna meet again.

He's agreed to bring me paper.

I'll call you later.

Just follow the light,
please.

45
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,838
It's been noted that
you were experiencing

Some ringing
in your ears.

Yes.

Well, I would like to keep you
here overnight for observation.

00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:45,827
Can you help me
turn him over?

I'm afraid I
can't allow you to--

Just help me.

60
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:09,968
We need to contact
the berlin police

61
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,137
And request
an immediate autopsy.

62
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,571
Why?

63
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:17,058
Because I don't think this man
died of natural causes.

Man:
Come on, Ella.

65
00:06:18,927 --> 00:06:22,314
If schumer met with this insider
at a train station in berlin,

66
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,032
The odds are this guy's
a foreign national.

67
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,401
So it's federal.
But you're not listening to me.

68
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:27,602
Let them meet again.

69
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:29,654
He's gonna bring paper,
Tommy will close him.

70
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,989
Then we have
a situation--

71
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,057
You still have to coordinate
with Justice

72
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,475
If you want him in
witness protection.

73

I just tried both their cells
again. Straight to voicemail.

Oh, shit.

I'm gonna try Tommy's
wife at work.

If I have to bring DOJ
into this

They're gonna do what
they've always done

78
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,286
With this investigation.

79
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:47,055
They're gonna stall us
out with red tape,

he could be the bombshell

00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:00,952
What do you want me
to do?

86
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:03,104
I can't afford another
turf war with Justice.

87
00:07:03,105 --> 00:07:04,322
It's Salinger.

88
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,025
Uh, finally.
Put him on speaker.

<i>Tommy's dead.</i>

00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,107
Salinger:
Unnaturally red blood,
lambent nasal membranes.

100
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:43,278
These are two key indicators
of hydrocyanic poisoning.

101
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,895
This lesion
on the back of the neck

102
00:07:44,896 --> 00:07:46,363
Is how the poison
was introduced

103
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:48,599
Into the bloodstream,
percutaneously.

104
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,918
The lesion tested negative
for any poison,

105
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,803
And there are any number
of reasons

106
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:54,706
For this discoloration
of the blood,

107
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,908
The least likely of which
is a hydrocyanic--

108
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,009
I'm telling you,
he was murdered.

109
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:08,769
Well, I'm assuming
you suspect a combination

110
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,139
Of prussic acid
and DMSO,

111
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,426
But then the reaction time
would have been immediate.

112
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,394
Within one minute.

113
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,314
Which means the killer would
have had to deliver the toxin

114
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:21,816
After schumer
exited the car.

115
00:08:21,817 --> 00:08:23,551
[music]

116
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:30,841
So did you see
anything unusual?

117
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:33,611
Anybody approaching
schumer?

118
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,950
No. I mean--

119
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,371
I don't know.

120
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:44,872
What is it that makes
you so certain

121
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:46,607
He was assassinated?

122
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:54,933
Agent Salinger and I

123
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,901
Have reason to believe
this might be connected

124
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:59,136
To an ongoing investigation
being conducted

125
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:02,774
By both my team at the manhattan
da's office and interpol.

126
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,610
What investigation?
I run a group at interpol

127
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,361
That focuses
on financial operations

128
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:09,364
Associated with
organized crime.

129
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:10,982
About two years ago,

130
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,750
We began receiving
correlated intelligence

131
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,702
Regarding the illicit
activities

132
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:16,538
Of a bank based out
of Luxembourg.

133
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:19,040
The international bank
of business and credit.

134
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:22,026
Under the direction of its
chairman, Jonas Skarssen,

135
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:24,362
We believe the ibbc
has quietly become

136
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,463
The bank of choice
for monies associated

137
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:28,216
With organized crime,
capital flight--

138
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:30,201
How is any of this
related to schumer,

139
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,504
And the New York
da's office?

140
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,938
The ibbc's
manhattan branch

141
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:37,225
Is the epicenter of its u.S.
Money-laundering operation.

142
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:39,594
Schumer and I were working
this case together.

143
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:41,328
Agent Salinger
and his department

144
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:42,564
Have been assisting us.

145
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:44,331
Why weren't we informed
of these details

146
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:46,117
Prior to this briefing?

147
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:50,354
[whispering indistinctly]

148
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:04,802
[sighs]

149
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:09,290
What was schumer doing
here in berlin?

150
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:12,126
I set him up on a blind date
with an ibbc executive

151
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:13,711
Who was aware
of our investigation

152
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:15,430
And looking
to make a deal.

153
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:17,682
And the identity
of this informant?

154
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,700
We don't know.
He took precautions

155
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:21,519
To keep his identity
anonymous.

156
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,271
But for the past 12 hours, I've
been trying hard to find him,

157
00:10:24,272 --> 00:10:26,674
Because I believe that if this
man isn't already dead,

158
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:27,958
He soon will be.

159
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,561
Why?

160
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,263
Because,
just like schumer,

161
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,899
Anyone that's been in a position
to move against this bank

162
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,318
Has either ended up dead

Agent Salinger,

00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:42,240
Given your history
with this matter,

165
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,659
I should think
you would be more careful

166
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,462
Before making
such extreme accusations.

167
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:49,214
My history?
What are you talking about?

168
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,966
We've reviewed
your dossier.

Have you?

170
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:58,222
Well, that means you know

Pursuing the ibbc

Don't give me that shit.

I found the guy that schumer
met with in berlin.

218
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,029
André clément?

219
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,548
The ibbc's senior vice president
of acquisitions.

220
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:48,439
He was killed
in a road accident

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,640
Just outside Luxembourg

222
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,909
Approximately nine hours
after schumer's death.

223
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,845
And this is the gendarmerie's
preliminary accident report.

224
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:58,249
He arrived in berlin
at 8 a.M.

225
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,086
On luxair, flight 9871
from Luxembourg.

226
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,288
But what doesn't track
is in his statement,

227
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,040
The ibbc chairman,
Jonas Skarssen,

228
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,191
Claims that clément had
been with him in Luxembourg

229
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:09,760
Since 10 a.M.,

230
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:11,462
Which is obviously
impossible

231
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,848
If clément arrived
in berlin at 8 a.M.

232
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:17,051
Did the gendarmerie say anything
about this inconsistency?

233
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:18,869
Nothing.

234
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,389
I Haven't told them.
What?

235
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,975
I wanna go to Luxembourg
and question Skarssen myself.

236
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,977
No. Absolutely no.
Viktor, listen to me.

237
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,996
I go to Luxembourg, Skarssen
confirms that statement,

not at the yard anymore.

And pass your take onto

And then what?

This is commissioner villon

00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:04,969
I thought it would be useful
for him to join us,

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,519

Yes, but as
Mr. Skarssen's attorney,

I speak with you first.

If I was gonna meet
with you first,

276
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:26,957
Why didn't anybody tell me?

277
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,526
I understand, and I'm sorry
for the confusion,

278
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:32,797
But, uh, I'm sure I can help
answer your questions.

279
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,133
Now, please,
have a seat.

280
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:57,771
As I'm sure you're aware

281
00:20:57,772 --> 00:21:00,407
I have some questions
regarding andré clément.

282
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:03,477
Yes.

283
00:21:03,478 --> 00:21:05,813
It's my understanding
that Mr. Clément was working

284
00:21:05,814 --> 00:21:09,366
At Mr. Skarssen's residence
the night he was killed.

285
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:12,702
The night
of the accident, yes.

286
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:15,372
What time did he arrive
at Skarssen's home that day?

287
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:19,659
If I recall correctly,
around 6 p.M.

288
00:21:21,763 --> 00:21:23,380
You were there?

289
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:24,414
Yes.

290
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:28,419
And you're certain
about this time?

291
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,554
Quite.

292
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,422
I'm confused.

00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,125
What you're telling me
right now

294

Conflicts with
Skarssen's statement

295
00:21:36,794 --> 00:21:38,645
In the gendarmerie's
accident report,

296
00:21:38,646 --> 00:21:40,864
Which was that clément
had been working with him

297
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:43,116
At his home since
10 a.M. In the morning.

298
00:21:43,117 --> 00:21:45,819
Well, I was present when
Mr. Skarssen gave his statement.

299
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,073
That is not what he said.
It is according to this report.

300
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:51,741
May I?

301
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,314
Oh. There is an error
in the preliminary draft.

302
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:14,531
The time is wrong.

303
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:20,104
The finalized report here
says clément arrived at 6 p.M.

304
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,741
Villon:
Clerical errors like this
can happen from time to time.

305
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,076
This is why the gendarmerie
discourages the release

306
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:27,994
Of any preliminary
documentation

307
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:29,713
Pertaining to open cases.

308
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:32,766
So is there anything else

309
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:35,202
We can do for you,

Mr. Calvini, we'd like to know

And control systems
from your company.

The ibbc has purchased
billions of dollars worth

Of silkworm missiles from
the people's republic of china,

480
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:58,851
Of turkish aerotech?

481
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:03,289
But why is the bank committing
so much capital and resources

482
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,024
To the sale
of these missiles?

483

It's a test.

00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,571
In 99 percent
of the world's conflicts,

486
00:34:18,572 --> 00:34:21,624
And no one has the capacity
to manufacture them

487
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,828
Faster and cheaper than china.

488
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,580
What Skarssen
is attempting to do

489
00:34:27,581 --> 00:34:31,301
Is to make the ibbc
the exclusive broker

490
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:35,005
Of Chinese small arms
to the third world.

491
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:38,758
And the missile deal
is the gateway transaction.

492
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:41,227
Yeah, but billions
of dollars invested

493
00:34:41,228 --> 00:34:42,828
Simply to be a broker?

494
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:44,581
There can't be that much
profit for them.

495
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:48,768
No. This is not about making
profit from weapon sales.

496
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:53,623
It's about control.

497
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:57,661
Control the flow of weapons,
control the conflict.

498
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:58,895
No.

499
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:03,116
No, no.
The ibbc is a bank.

500
00:35:03,117 --> 00:35:06,969
Their objective isn't
to control the conflict,

501
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:10,540
It's to control the debt
that the conflict produces.

502
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:14,527
You see, the real value
of a conflict,

503
00:35:14,528 --> 00:35:16,046
The true value,

504
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,382
Is in the debt
that it creates.

505
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:22,334
You control the debt,

506
00:35:22,335 --> 00:35:24,570
You control everything.

507
00:35:26,673 --> 00:35:29,142
You find this
upsetting, yes?

508
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:33,546
But this is the very Essence
of the banking industry.

509
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:35,582
To make us all,
whether we be

510
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:38,917
Nations or individuals,

511
00:35:38,918 --> 00:35:42,087
Slaves to debt.

512

You sound like you're not
very fond of the ibbc.

What happened?

514
00:35:49,513 --> 00:35:52,415
I was fond of andré clément.

515
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,551
I trusted him,

516
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,419
And he was
a good friend.

By 160 basis points

They have doubled the cost

Well, general,
what do you expect?

567
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:05,064
You've been living in
the jungle long enough

568
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:06,665
To know that when
the lion kills,

It's the jackal
that profits.

Yes.

571
00:43:10,353 --> 00:43:12,654
The ibbc is
specifically structured

572
00:43:12,655 --> 00:43:15,658
To handle the particular needs
of your type of organization.

573
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,627
Of course we can give you
better rates and terms

Than any other competitors,

Weapons,

577
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,669
Intelligence,
logistical support,

578
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,105
Everything that the
revolutionary freedom front

579
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,307
Would need
to revive itself.

580
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,726
But in exchange
for what?

581
00:43:33,727 --> 00:43:37,279
You must understand,
the rff has no money.

With the right kind
of direction and support,

hope to gain from it?

Umberto Calvini
was assassinated,

at a political rally in milan.

we should wait

Until the authorities
resolve the matter,

606
00:45:05,034 --> 00:45:09,104
And then approach the sons
to revive negotiations.

How long will this take?

608

I've been assured
the investigation

609

Will move swiftly, but, uh,

There's no time
for complications.

617
00:45:30,944 --> 00:45:33,579
Mario and Enzo Calvini would've
made our deal long ago.

618
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,981
Now there's no reason
for them not to move forward.

An important man
and devoted father

to Calvini's family,

What about the guy in the car?

Cerutti:
The car was stolen.

630
00:46:12,586 --> 00:46:14,620
They were unable to lift
prints, fibers or residue,

631
00:46:14,621 --> 00:46:17,673
Or locate any witnesses who
saw him exiting the vehicle.

it appear as though they are.

This isn't my case,

If there was a second shooter,

00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,672
He could've positioned
himself here.

653
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:07,275
The stopwatch they found
in the room,

654
00:49:07,276 --> 00:49:09,411
It was set on
a one-minute countdown, yes?

655
00:49:09,412 --> 00:49:11,263
Right. Calvini
was killed

656
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:13,182
A little over one minute
into his speech.

657
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:16,335
What if this was
all synchronized?

658
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:21,657
Okay.

659
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:25,460
Let's say I'm
the second shooter.

660
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:28,597
The guy below
doesn't know I'm here,

661
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:32,467
But I'm positioned
right above his room.

<i>Which I start when Calvini
begins his speech.</i>

665
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:44,963
The sniper below has been
instructed to do the same,

666
00:49:44,964 --> 00:49:47,499
Because that's when he's
gonna fire his first bullet.

667
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,801
If he misses,

with one of my own.</i>

with a headshot.</i>

673
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:04,282
It's a good theory,
but there's one problem.

674
00:50:04,283 --> 00:50:05,467
Why?

675
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:11,440
Two shots were fired
from the window,

676
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,275
<i>Two slugs were recovered
from the stage,</i>

677
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,861
And two casings were found
next to the gun.

678
00:50:15,862 --> 00:50:17,680
Ballistics confirming
that the casings

679
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,381
<i>Came from the gun
in the hotel room.</i>

680
00:50:19,382 --> 00:50:22,868
<i>So if the kill shot came from
a second shooter on the roof,</i>

681
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:25,788
That'd be a total
of three bullets fired.

682
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:28,073
How do you explain the absence
of the third bullet?

683
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,477
I can't.

Of the Stefan heuss hit

from a custom shoe

Made for a leg brace.

700
00:51:43,783 --> 00:51:46,118
The braces are typically
made out of steel,

701
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:48,019
Or alloy,
but the condition of the leg

702
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,388
Would determine the specific
type of device used.

That these prints
are a match

711
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:13,878
It means the bank's
used the same assassin twice.

Good evening,

I'm agent
Louis Salinger.

I know who you are.

1180
01:25:17,462 --> 01:25:19,262
Of course you do.

1181
01:25:21,532 --> 01:25:24,000
I was at the guggenheim

<i>Salinger [over speaker]:

<i>I know you were his handler.</i>

1184
01:25:31,809 --> 01:25:33,694
And I know that you arranged
for him to be killed

1185
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:34,828
At the behest of the bank,

1186
01:25:34,829 --> 01:25:37,497
Because I was obviously
getting too close.

1187
01:25:40,785 --> 01:25:43,437
But if a hit team at the
guggenheim is what happens

1188
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:46,273
Because I was
getting too close to him...

1189
01:25:48,709 --> 01:25:50,277
What do you think
the bank's gonna do

1190
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:52,045
When it realizes
how close I am to you?

1191
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:57,751
Death comes for us all,
agent Salinger.

1192
01:25:57,752 --> 01:26:00,319
Yeah, but based on everything
I've read about you,

1193
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,188
You seem like the kind of man

1194
01:26:02,189 --> 01:26:05,391
Who aspired to die
for something more than this.

1195
01:26:06,844 --> 01:26:11,715
Well, this is the difference
between truth and fiction.

1196
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:15,135
Fiction has to make sense.

1197
01:26:17,772 --> 01:26:19,922
I'm confused, colonel.

1198
01:26:23,027 --> 01:26:26,028
Why would a tried
and true communist,

1199
01:26:26,029 --> 01:26:28,782
A hardliner that spent
30 years in the stasi

1200
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:31,201
Fighting against the evils
of capitalism...

1201
01:26:31,202 --> 01:26:32,785
Why would this man waste

1202
01:26:32,786 --> 01:26:34,604
His final days
working for an institution

1203
01:26:34,605 --> 01:26:38,641
That was the very embodiment
of everything he once despised?

1204
01:26:41,094 --> 01:26:44,314
Salinger:
You dedicated your life
to the communist ideal.

1205
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:49,803
You sacrificed everything
for the good of the party.

1206
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:53,006
For what?

1207
01:26:56,326 --> 01:26:59,795
You lost your wife
to betrayal.

1208
01:26:59,796 --> 01:27:02,198
Your daughter to suicide.

1209
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:04,800
And when the wall fell,

1210
01:27:04,801 --> 01:27:07,070
Your whole life
fell apart with it.

1211
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:09,823
You know nothing about me.

1212
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:14,110
I was lost long
before the wall fell.

1213
01:27:14,111 --> 01:27:19,132
I was once destined to become
a man much like yourself.

1214
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:21,334
True-hearted,

1215
01:27:21,335 --> 01:27:23,436
Determined,

1216
01:27:23,437 --> 01:27:26,406
Full of purpose.

1217
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,841
But, uh,

1218
01:27:28,842 --> 01:27:31,777
Character is easier kept
than recovered.

1219
01:27:33,097 --> 01:27:37,400
We cannot control
the things life does to us.

1220
01:27:37,401 --> 01:27:40,136
They are done
before you know it,

1221
01:27:40,137 --> 01:27:42,655
And once they are done,

1222
01:27:42,656 --> 01:27:45,325
They make you do other things,

1223
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:49,696
Until at last
everything comes between you

1224
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:52,715
And the man you wanted to be.

1225
01:27:54,151 --> 01:27:55,818
No.

1226
01:27:57,521 --> 01:28:00,990
We all have choices in life.
You made yours.

1227
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:10,283
Sometimes a man
can meet his destiny

1228
01:28:10,284 --> 01:28:12,085
On the road
he took to avoid it.

1229
01:28:15,473 --> 01:28:18,157
Skarssen and that bank need
to answer for what they've done.

1230
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:20,293
They have to be
brought to Justice.

1231
01:28:20,294 --> 01:28:22,612
You can help me do that.

1232
01:28:22,613 --> 01:28:25,214
Justice

1233
01:28:25,215 --> 01:28:27,484
Is not possible.

1234
01:28:27,485 --> 01:28:29,736
Why not?

1235
01:28:29,737 --> 01:28:32,438
Because, agent Salinger,

1236
01:28:32,439 --> 01:28:36,826
Your idea of Justice
is an illusion.

1237
01:28:36,827 --> 01:28:38,928
<i>[over speaker]
don't you understand
the very system</i>

1238
01:28:38,929 --> 01:28:40,263

1239
01:28:40,264 --> 01:28:41,831

<i>To Skarssen

1241
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:46,002
Wexler:
On the contrary.

1242
01:28:46,003 --> 01:28:50,307
The system guarantees
the ibbc's safety,

1243
01:28:50,308 --> 01:28:54,144
Because everyone is involved.

1244
01:28:54,145 --> 01:28:56,779
What do you mean,
"everyone"?

1245

<i>[over speaker]
governments of iran, germany,
china, your government.</i>

1250
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:15,282
Every multinational
corporation, every one.

1251
01:29:15,283 --> 01:29:19,869
They all need
banks like the ibbc

1252
01:29:19,870 --> 01:29:21,671
So that they can operate

1253
01:29:21,672 --> 01:29:25,225
Within the black
and gray latitudes.

1254
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:27,376
And this is why
your investigative efforts

1255
01:29:27,377 --> 01:29:31,181
Have either been ignored
or undermined,

1256
01:29:31,182 --> 01:29:34,634
And why you and I
will be quietly disposed of

1257
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:37,837
Before any case
against the bank

1258

Ever reaches a court of law.

1259
01:29:46,229 --> 01:29:48,865
<i>[over speaker]
so, what are we all
supposed to do?</i>

1260
01:29:51,818 --> 01:29:54,254
We just supposed
to give up,

1261
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:57,857
And accept that this
is the way of the world?

1262
01:30:01,412 --> 01:30:03,763
I'm not gonna do that.

1263
01:30:04,865 --> 01:30:08,201
I still believe--
I know--

1264
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:12,238
That there has to be a way
to bring down this bank,

1265
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,741
And you are
gonna help me.

1266
01:30:21,782 --> 01:30:23,916
You understand...

1267
01:30:25,319 --> 01:30:29,689
If you really want
to stop the ibbc,

1268
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:31,324
You won't be able
to do it

1269
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:35,328
Within the boundaries
of your system of Justice.

1270
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:38,415
You will have to go outside.

1271
01:30:38,416 --> 01:30:40,500
Once you do...

1272
01:30:41,935 --> 01:30:45,738
There will always be
collateral damage.

1273
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:52,979
<i>[over speaker]
yes.</i>

1274
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:56,916
<i>Should you sacrifice your own
ideals for the greater good?</i>

1275
01:30:58,652 --> 01:31:03,056
<i>That's a difficult choice,
one I understand all too well,</i>

1276
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:05,892
But as you so
eloquently put it,

1277
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:09,479
Sometimes a man
can meet his destiny

1278
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:13,516
On the road
he took to avoid it.

1279
01:31:24,462 --> 01:31:26,162
What?

1280
01:31:26,163 --> 01:31:27,596
What are you doing?

1281
01:31:27,597 --> 01:31:30,200
I think it's time
for you to leave.

1282
01:31:30,201 --> 01:31:33,135
Leave? What are you
talking about?

1283
01:31:33,136 --> 01:31:35,404
You know what
I'm talking about.

1284

No way, lou.

1285
01:31:40,694 --> 01:31:44,113
