l like it too. Very little.

1258
01:32:13,238 --> 01:32:16,150
But they get out of control
and you don't say, "That hurts. "

1259
01:32:16,238 --> 01:32:18,194
-But they are.
-l sort oflike it.

1260
01:32:19,558 --> 01:32:21,947
Because l'm black,
you say l got to do a B and E?

1261
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:23,511
No, no, but....

1262
01:32:23,678 --> 01:32:26,067
l pulled your record
before l came over here, too.

1263
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:28,069
l know what you used to do.

1264
01:32:28,318 --> 01:32:29,273
And l still do.

1265
01:32:29,358 --> 01:32:31,110
-You been with a big woman?
-l have.

1266
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:32,233
How was that?

1267
01:32:32,318 --> 01:32:34,752
lt was fine.

1268
01:32:35,038 --> 01:32:37,632
But l will say this, they're not jolly.

1269
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:39,436
-They can be cranky.
-Feed them.

1270
01:32:39,518 --> 01:32:42,032
-Now, you like big women?
-l love big women.

1271
01:32:42,118 --> 01:32:44,757
lf you want to feel the heat,
you got to have the meat.

1272
01:32:44,838 --> 01:32:45,748
Yeah, baby.

1273
01:32:45,838 --> 01:32:47,954
A big woman good
in the summer and winter.

1274
01:32:48,038 --> 01:32:50,677
Good for shade in summer
and good for warmth in winter.

1275
01:32:50,758 --> 01:32:51,907
You're not masturbating enough.

1276
01:32:51,998 --> 01:32:54,114
-l masturbate two, three times a day.
-Do you?

1277
01:32:54,198 --> 01:32:56,109
l like to do it at the tanning salon.

1278
01:32:56,278 --> 01:32:59,588
-Cause, you are in there--
-At the tanning salon.

1279
01:32:59,678 --> 01:33:01,316
You probably aren't in there.

1280
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:05,116
But you got to be careful,
because when you're doing it...

1281
01:33:05,318 --> 01:33:09,106
...you can't wear the goggles,
you got to watch the door.

1282
01:33:09,318 --> 01:33:12,310
So you can go blind masturbating actually,
like the old saying.

1283
01:33:15,438 --> 01:33:17,747
Every night, same routine. l get a towel...

1284
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:21,746
...half damp. On one side, warm water.
Half dry on the other.

1285
01:33:21,958 --> 01:33:23,755
Astroglide. Lesbian porn.

1286
01:33:23,838 --> 01:33:25,157
Second only to nature.

1287
01:33:25,238 --> 01:33:28,150
No dicks allowed, number 67 or 69.

1288
01:33:28,358 --> 01:33:31,191
l don't get in trouble.
Clean up, everything's nice.

1289
01:33:31,398 --> 01:33:33,992
Although you can get that
on the remote control.

1290
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:36,712
When you do a number two,
do you use a handy wipe?

1291
01:33:36,918 --> 01:33:40,627
l wipe, then l take a lot of toilet paper
and dip it in water....

1292
01:33:40,798 --> 01:33:43,471
-ln the bowl?
-ln a clean bowl.

1293
01:33:43,558 --> 01:33:45,674
-That's what l do.
-And then l wipe my ass.

1294
01:33:45,758 --> 01:33:48,147
We're too old to have shit stains
in our drawers.

1295
01:33:48,238 --> 01:33:50,672
Can't be cool
when you got a big-ass shit stain.

1296
01:33:50,758 --> 01:33:53,033
l've not peed the bed since l quit drinking.

1297
01:33:53,118 --> 01:33:55,871
l won a chugging contest before l quit.

1298
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:58,267
And l not only peed the bed, l shit the bed.

1299
01:33:58,358 --> 01:34:02,237
l was in college. l woke and thought:
"What did my roommate do?"

1300
01:34:03,078 --> 01:34:05,546
And then l went:
"Wait a minute. What did l do?"

1301
01:34:05,638 --> 01:34:07,788
lf you have a real problem, get Viagra.

1302
01:34:07,998 --> 01:34:10,910
You don't need a problem for that.
You just go and get it.

1303
01:34:10,998 --> 01:34:12,795
They need to get that for women.

1304
01:34:12,878 --> 01:34:14,914
Well, they would call it Niagara then.

1305
01:34:15,478 --> 01:34:17,355
-You watch Oprah?
-Big or small Oprah?

1306
01:34:17,438 --> 01:34:20,077
l never liked small Oprah
because her head is too big.

1307
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:23,594
Her head too big for that little body.
Then the eye started to droop.

1308
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:25,557
Looked like E. T.

1309
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:28,188
-Oprah, stay big.
-Oprah's great.

1310
01:34:31,998 --> 01:34:34,466
