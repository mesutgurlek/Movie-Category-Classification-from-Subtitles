00:28:26,782 --> 00:28:30,284
Excuse me?
What department
you work in, Officer?

294
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:33,454
Youth Services Division.
I picked her up
at orientation.

295
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:35,456
Ah, I see.
Youth Services.

296
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:38,660
I've wait-listed over a year
to get that transfer,
and I am not gonna jeopardize--

297
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:43,097
Jeopardize what?
Cushy desk job?

298
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:46,401
Forensics is not my area.
I disagree with you.

299
00:28:46,403 --> 00:28:48,402
You can't force me
to take this assignment.

300
00:28:51,706 --> 00:28:54,941
- I can.
- And if I refuse?

301
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:57,310
I would say that you're
putting your career
at serious risk.

302
00:28:57,312 --> 00:29:00,613
You think because of your
condition you have the right
to push people around?

303
00:29:00,615 --> 00:29:02,782
I'm sorry.
That is truly pathetic.

304
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,850
Truly?

305
00:29:04,852 --> 00:29:07,186
You're damn right, truly.

306
00:29:07,188 --> 00:29:10,489
Well, forgive me, <i>truly,</i>

307
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:14,560
if I insist on having
someone with your brains
and a fresh pair of eyes.

308
00:29:14,562 --> 00:29:17,362
<i>There's a life</i>
<i>at stake here, Officer.</i>

309
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:20,466
Paulie, we're gonna
need some key people
and some tech support.

310
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:22,468
Okay?
I know the guys.

311
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,470
Okay.

312
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:26,606
What the hell
are you smiling at?

313
00:29:36,283 --> 00:29:38,284
Pull up a chair.

314
00:29:38,286 --> 00:29:42,021
I want you to tell me
everything you know
about the crime scene.

315
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:45,358
Basically,
it's all in my report.
I read your report.

316
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,960
I want to know
want you felt,

317
00:29:47,962 --> 00:29:50,430
what you feel...

318
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:52,832
in the deepest recesses
of your senses.

319
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:56,603
Why, you really are
in love with the sound
of your own voice, aren't you?

320
00:29:56,605 --> 00:29:59,873
Now it's your voice I'm yearning
to hear. Pull up a chair.
I won't bite you.

321
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:16,654
<i>[ Ringing ]</i>

322
00:30:18,758 --> 00:30:20,625
<i>[ Ringing Stops ]</i>

323

[ Ticking ]

324
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:31,535
The rifling on the .38 slug
they dug out of the victim...

325
00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:35,406
is consistent with
a Webley, a very old
turn-of-the-century handgun.

326
00:30:35,408 --> 00:30:38,476
Thank you, Kenny. On the
big board, please. Paulie,
what do you got on that bolt?

327
00:30:38,478 --> 00:30:42,046
There's three initials
on the head-- N.S.G.

328
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,682
And the bolt's not steel.
It's iron.

329
00:30:44,684 --> 00:30:47,185
<i>Iron? Iron, iron.</i>

330
00:30:47,187 --> 00:30:50,990
Making it old, like the Webley.

331
00:30:50,992 --> 00:30:53,392
<i>Officer Donaghy, what do you</i>
<i>know about asbestos?</i>

332
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:56,362
Uh, it kills hard-working
Americans every day.

333
00:30:56,364 --> 00:30:59,933
- [ Chuckles ] Very good.
You computer literate?
- A little.

334
00:30:59,935 --> 00:31:03,905
Thelma! Thelma?
Where's my Thelma?

335
00:31:03,907 --> 00:31:05,940
<i>Yes.</i>

336
00:31:05,942 --> 00:31:08,276
<i>Thelma, meet Amelia.</i>
<i>Amelia, Thelma.</i>

337
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:10,645
<i>Amelia hates my books</i>
<i>and also computers,</i>

338
00:31:10,647 --> 00:31:12,647
but she's got an A-plus nose
for evidence.

339
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:16,952
So I want you
to give her a crash course
in how to access D.E.P. files.

340
00:31:16,954 --> 00:31:21,389
<i>Check and see if there's any</i>
<i>large asbestos cleanups going</i>
<i>on anywhere in the city, okay?</i>

341
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:24,359
A.S.A.P.

342
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:26,762
Where the hell
is Eddie Ortiz?
<i>I'm right here!</i>

343
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:29,998
<i>¿Qué pasa, Paco?</i>
<i>¿Qué pasa,</i> Eddie?

344
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,466
How's the world's
crankiest criminalist doing?

345
00:31:32,468 --> 00:31:36,137
- Playing beat the clock,
you know?
- Everybody's worst nightmare.

346
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:39,673
You get into a cab, and there's
a damn psycho from Jersey
behind the wheel.

347
00:31:39,675 --> 00:31:41,676
We don't know
he's from Jersey.

348
00:31:41,678 --> 00:31:44,946
Yeah, Bayonne. It's the toxins
in the water over there.

349
00:31:44,948 --> 00:31:48,449
- What'd you do?
Bring the whole lab with you?
- Mama told me "be prepared."

350
00:31:48,451 --> 00:31:51,185
- Where do you want this shit?
- Over here in the corner.

351
00:31:51,187 --> 00:31:54,255
<i>How is your mother?</i>
Oh, God. She's 76,

352
00:31:54,257 --> 00:31:57,023
and she's schtupping
some guy named Morris.

353
00:31:57,025 --> 00:32:00,427
- God bless her.
- But it's Morris the schtarker
I'm worried about.

354
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:04,130
He's 79 with a tricky ticker
and an active pecker.

355
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:05,831
Hey.

356
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:15,640
- Afternoon. Captain Cheney.
- <i>[ Lincoln ] Amelia, what do</i>
<i>you got on that asbestos?</i>

357
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,210
There's about
a dozen cleanups scattered
about the five boroughs.

358
00:32:19,212 --> 00:32:21,245
<i>Put it up on the viewer for me,</i>
<i>will you, please?</i>

359
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:24,315
<i>See if you can narrow it down</i>
<i>to the oldest location</i>
<i>as soon as you can.</i>

360
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,317
<i>How're you doing, Howard?</i>
Fine, thank you.

361
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,154
How's it going?
In the middle of the middle,
as you can see.

362
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:33,791
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Linc, look what I found
on the threading of that bolt.

363
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:37,961
Huh. I was hoping
to grab a minute with you,
if you don't mind.

364
00:32:37,963 --> 00:32:41,831
- Excuse me, Howard.
- Oh. Sorry, sorry.

365
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:46,369
We got Officer Donaghy here
to thank for photographing
the crucial evidence.

366
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:49,539
Crucial evidence?
We don't know that.

367
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:53,377
Listen, Linc, I just
stopped by to make sure you
had all the support you need.

368
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:58,015
As you know, I'm putting
the full resources of my
department at your... disposal.

369
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,418
And I appreciate it,
Howie. Thank you.

370
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,520
<i>But the thing is, Linc,</i>

371
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:07,225
you see, I've formalized the
department's standard procedures
since you were in charge, so--

372
00:33:07,227 --> 00:33:09,961
Eddie, could you put what you
got up on my screen, please?

373
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:13,698
<i>So I'd appreciate it</i>
<i>if you kept me in the loop.</i>

374
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,335
- Absolutely.
- At all times.

375
00:33:17,337 --> 00:33:21,539
At all-- Eddie, what the hell
is that we're looking at?

376
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:25,610
<i>Uh, old paper.</i>

377
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:27,745
<i>Coarse grade.</i>

378
00:33:27,747 --> 00:33:31,382
I'd say, uh,
80, 90 years old.

379
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,718
Turn of the century,
it looks like.

380
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,887
Huh. The perp
likes old.

381
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,690
<i>Uh, fine, then.</i>

382
00:33:39,692 --> 00:33:43,627
Look, I'll be in my office
if you need me.
Yeah, okay, Howard.

383
00:33:43,629 --> 00:33:45,629
Good.

384
00:33:49,535 --> 00:33:52,971
Old paper.
Old gun.

385
00:33:55,108 --> 00:33:58,844
<i>Buries his victim in a vintage</i>
<i>Civil War railroad bed.</i>

386
00:33:59,946 --> 00:34:02,648
Sand.

387
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:06,051
Sand, sand. What--
Eddie, what do you got
on the sand?

388
00:34:06,053 --> 00:34:10,689
Doesn't really
look like sand.

389
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:13,793
<i>I'm not sure.</i>
Can you individuate it?

390
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:16,596
Oh, if I had an E.D.X. here,
I could do anything.

391
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,432
We don't have a goddamn
"E" the fuck "X," Eddie!

392
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:22,569
Oh, look who forgot their

Okay, we're talking,
uh, pearly looking.

395
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:35,181
Some kind of a...
shellfish or something.

396
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,818
Oyster shells maybe?

397
00:34:40,388 --> 00:34:43,657
Could be.

398
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:46,626
Definitely. If I had to bet
on it, I'd say it was. Sure.

399
00:34:50,397 --> 00:34:52,265
<i>[ Amelia ]</i>
<i>All right, I got it. The oldest</i>

In 1913 when the Woolworth
Building was being built,

401
00:35:28,136 --> 00:35:31,871
workmen found the body
of this rich industrialist,

402
00:35:31,873 --> 00:35:35,208
<i>He'd been kidnapped</i>
<i>the year before,</i>
<i>shot in the head and buried.</i>

403
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:38,978
And what they thought
was white sand turned out
to be oyster... shells.

404
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:43,949
Crushed oyster shells. That's
what they used as landfill
in lower Manhattan.

405
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:46,718

<i>She's gonna be underground.</i>

408
00:35:51,626 --> 00:35:56,796
<i>She's gonna be in</i>
<i>a basement... near...</i>
<i>or in the Woolworth Building.</i>

Hey, Paulie.
Call Emergency Services Unit.

Have them meet us
down by the Woolworth Building.

411

Tell them to start their search.
Maybe we'll get lucky.

412
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:06,408
Okay? Eddie.

Yeah.

- <i>No, you gotta stay here</i>
<i>with me.</i>

416
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:16,852
<i>We gotta work that bolt.</i>
<i>That's the missing piece.</i>

He was
born brilliant. It happens.

424
00:36:54,261 --> 00:36:57,128
I mean
the physical part.

425
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,131
About four years ago,
he was working the body
of a transit cop...

426
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:03,534
been found shot
in a subway tunnel.

427
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:07,038
Beam came down, damn near
cut him in half.

428
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,642

On weekends, always one or
two cops there lending a hand.
