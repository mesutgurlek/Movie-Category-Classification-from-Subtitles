No.

even know you,
think you're an asshole.

You don't know me,
but my first year
in the Academy,

167
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:18,050
you gave a talk.

The "long game"
you called it.

169
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:22,675
You talked about
a moral compass.

170
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:24,883
About how you believed
in yours immutably.

171
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:29,050
And I thought to myself,
"That guy.

"One day,
I want to be that guy."

Technically, it was
a few pigeons, but I hear
what you're saying.

So here's what
I'm going to do.

to devote resources
to another snipe hunt.

178
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:49,758
I came to clean this mess up,
not add to it. I'm sorry.

179
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:50,883

The problem is

00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:00,342
when you're two people
at the same time,

185

to trip the other.

what's going on here.

Well, Lula's been on

for the last decade,

and I think she
has some real talent,

and I'd like to
try her on stage

No, are you serious, man?

you said I could
get back on stage again.

just showed up.

is we've been in this...

308
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,050
Yeah, the issue
is that we have been
rehearsing for months

309
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,883
for something...
We don't even
know what it is.

310
00:14:49,883 --> 00:14:50,967
And you're going to
keep working until...

311

any sex in high school,

767

I was able to
transition upward

Well, to start with,
the man you stole from
last year,

805
00:37:28,883 --> 00:37:30,342
turns out I had invested

806
00:37:30,342 --> 00:37:31,717
quite a lot of money
in some of his companies,

807
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:34,967
so a lot of what you
stole was, in fact, mine.

Could we create actual,
genuine magic?

816

And I'm guessing one of you
achieved that dream,

Now, if we can
get it to them,

00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,425
I know who you are,

1072
00:49:58,425 --> 00:49:59,675
Shrike.

1073
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:02,967
I know you blame me
for your father's death.

1074
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:07,008
I know you think
I goaded him into performing
a trick he couldn't pull off.

1075
00:50:07,008 --> 00:50:09,425
I know the time in
jail was a result

1076
00:50:09,425 --> 00:50:11,592
of a 30-year revenge plot
against me.

1077
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,300
Supposing that's all true,
you think I'd tell you now?

1078
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,508
Man.

1079
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,425
30 years.

1080
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:24,592
and the greatest long game
magic trick ever created.

1081
00:50:24,592 --> 00:50:26,967
Just to put me
behind bars.

1082
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:28,342
Okay.

1083
00:50:29,925 --> 00:50:31,883
So how did it feel,
seeing me there?

1084
00:50:32,842 --> 00:50:34,675
Was it all you hoped?

1085
00:50:34,717 --> 00:50:35,883
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1086
00:50:35,883 --> 00:50:37,050
You're lying.

1087
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,425
It was an empty experience.

1088
00:50:40,425 --> 00:50:42,508
And you wanna know
how I know?

1089
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:46,425
I know because you know.

1090
00:50:47,592 --> 00:50:50,842
There's always, always more

1091
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:52,675
than what's on the surface.
So what,

1092
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,300
the past didn't happen,
and you're not
who I think you are?

1093
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,883
Now, don't tell me
in 30 years

1094
00:50:55,883 --> 00:50:58,758
that's the first time you've
asked yourself that question.

1095
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:00,925
I am not my father.

1096
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:02,758
You're not getting
in my head, okay?

1097
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:05,425
You think you're
luring me into a trap?
You're not.

1098
00:51:05,425 --> 00:51:08,008
Now, I am desperate,
which means I'm dangerous.

1099
00:51:08,008 --> 00:51:11,633
My only concern is
the health and well-being
of the Horsemen.

1100
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:14,425
And you're gonna
lead me to them.
And if you don't,

1101
00:51:14,425 --> 00:51:16,425
I promise you,
you're gonna end up
far worse

1102
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:19,008
than in some cushy
jail cell somewhere.

1103
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:36,050
THADDEUS: What if the Horsemen
don't actually
need you to save them?

1104
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:43,342
ATLAS: All right.
So the lab is made up
of two distinct layers,

1105
00:51:43,342 --> 00:51:44,633
the security perimeter

1106
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:46,633
and the clean room.

1107
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:48,675
The stick we're looking for
should be in this core.

1108
00:51:48,717 --> 00:51:50,717
So we're gonna have to
get underneath, extract it,

1109
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:52,633
and replace it with a decoy.

1110
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:58,592
Luckily, it's similar
in weight and size
to a playing card,

1111
00:51:58,592 --> 00:52:00,550
so we're gonna have to
brush up on our card-istry.

1112
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:03,675
Whoa, whoa!

1113
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:09,342
That's no good.

1114
00:52:18,717 --> 00:52:20,967
ATLAS: So how do we get in?
Hannes Pike.

1115
00:52:20,967 --> 00:52:22,842
He's the son of
a South African gangster.

1116
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:24,800
<i>He's RSVP'd with</i>
<i>what looks like</i>

1117
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,675
<i>a couple of members</i>
<i>of his security detail.</i>

1118
00:52:26,717 --> 00:52:29,717
<i>A doctor, to vet it, I guess,</i>
<i>and somebody named Buffy.</i>

1119
00:52:29,717 --> 00:52:33,508
LULA:  <i>Yeah, apparently,</i>
<i>he travels with a different</i>
<i>bimbo every week. Hmm.</i>

1120
00:52:33,508 --> 00:52:35,550
I wonder which one of us
gets to play the bimbo.

1121
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:46,675
Hey, can I get in?

1122
00:52:48,425 --> 00:52:49,925
At the soothing
sound of the slots

1123
00:52:49,925 --> 00:52:53,508
you slip into a serene state
of slumber and sleep.

1124
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:59,300
<i>they will think you're Hannes,</i>
<i>so lead them out</i>
<i>and keep them busy.</i>

1125
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,508
You trust your
people implicitly.

1126
00:53:01,508 --> 00:53:03,550
You will have them
take care of everything,

1127
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:04,967
and you will wait
in the car.

1128
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:08,675
And eyes open,
wide awake. Go.

These people
are following me.

You might wanna
check their pockets.

1136
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:42,717
Ah! Hannes, my old friend.

1137
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:44,425
So glad
you could make it.

1138
00:53:44,425 --> 00:53:47,550
I knew you had
a soft spot for
an old-school bidding war.

1139
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:48,675
How have you been?

1140
00:53:48,717 --> 00:53:50,842
I trust my people
implicitly.

1141
00:53:50,842 --> 00:53:55,592
Certainly. But I'm sure
you'd like to see
it for yourself.

1142
00:53:55,592 --> 00:53:58,425
Hold it in your hands,
check the build quality.

1143
00:54:00,717 --> 00:54:03,425
Or not. Also fine.

1144
00:54:03,425 --> 00:54:05,508
Well, if you'd like
to follow me.

1145

You'll have to
remove all your metal.

1147
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:13,967
Yeah, of course.

1148
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:15,842
Excuse me for asking...

1149
00:54:15,842 --> 00:54:17,758
Where might I
have seen you before?

1150

I don't know, probably
one of my many symposiums.

The book jacket!

1152
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,342
I have to say,
Dr. Michaelakis,

1153
00:54:24,383 --> 00:54:25,592
I'm a huge fan.

1154
00:54:25,592 --> 00:54:27,550
(CHUCKLING) Oh,
thank you so much.

1155
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:31,008
Uh, which book?
There have been so many.

1156
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,883
Does Hannes' chippy
always talk for you, Doctor?

1157
00:54:35,717 --> 00:54:36,758
Doctor?

1158
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:43,342
Sorry, when you say "chippy,"
you are referring
to Buffy here, yeah?

1159
00:54:43,342 --> 00:54:44,508
Of course.

1160
00:54:46,425 --> 00:54:48,550
Hannes prefers
the term "floozy"

1161
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:50,842
for all his boy toys.

1162
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:53,883
Yeah. He does.
That's good.
Noted.

1163
00:54:53,883 --> 00:54:56,008
By the way,
I got your email,
Dr. Michaelakis.

1164
00:54:56,008 --> 00:54:57,633
You had a query
about our ability

1165
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:59,758
to maintain quantum coherence
at room temperature

1166
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,675
without the use of dilution,
refrigerators,

1167
00:55:01,717 --> 00:55:04,425
or error correction.

1168
00:55:04,425 --> 00:55:06,008
Do you care
to elucidate?

1169
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:07,550
Right.
Yeah.

1170
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:09,550
Yes, I did send that email.

1171
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,342
The other day, I saw you.
I did, I sent it.

1172
00:55:11,383 --> 00:55:12,592
So what gives?

1173
00:55:12,592 --> 00:55:14,008
I'm sorry, what gives...

1174
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,675
I think what
she's trying to say...

1175
00:55:15,717 --> 00:55:17,717
Actually, the grown-ups
are having a meeting, Buffy.

1176
00:55:17,717 --> 00:55:19,008
Okay.

1177
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,467
If you'll hold on to that.

1178
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:22,300
Yeah, sure, Doctor.
Thank you.

1179
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,717
Now, every seventh grader,
even the dumb ones,

1180
00:55:24,717 --> 00:55:26,842
know the second law
of thermodynamics.

1181
00:55:26,883 --> 00:55:28,842
"All ordered systems
tend toward disorder."

1182
00:55:28,842 --> 00:55:30,633
Disorder!

1183
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:34,508
So I'm going to ask you one
more time, sir, what gives?

1184
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:44,342
Well, it's actually
topological quantum order.

1185
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:47,425
The emergence of
quantum effects
on a macroscopic level.

1186
00:55:47,425 --> 00:55:50,383
So that is,
in fact, what gives.

of any computing
system on the planet

sweep them into your bin.

Ah! Broomstick.
That's funny.

Take a look,
vet it however you'd like,

And then I put it in

It's actually
by the magician

1620

that made me wanna do this
in the first place.

It's, uh...

"A magician's greatest power
lies forever shrouded

"in his empty fist."

"And the very idea
that he can convince
the world

And what does
the stick do?

1632

The stick can
unencode anything.

there are five of us.

need supplies, right?
And resources.

1642

than five people.

the Fool is the most
powerful card in the tarot?

1646

He's a fool

1648

because he's a clean slate,
