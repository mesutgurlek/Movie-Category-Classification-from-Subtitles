in the head and missed.

the New York families too.

a good idea to have this meeting...

up in the country, nice and quiet.

Get away from the car!

24

Turns out the local cops were
watching Joe Barbara like a hawk...

25
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:23,495
...and some deputy sheriff notices
all the traffic and calls the feds.

26

The meeting never even
got started.

The feds moved in...

...and bingo, the bosses,
they moved out.

29
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:05,412
My father and Dominic, they hid
in the field with some hay or corn...

...some kind of foliage, I don't know.

31

Along comes a farmer.

32
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:11,876
Dominic bullshits him
while my father holds out...

33
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:15,797
...this .44 cannon he used to carry,
and hijacked the tractor.

34
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:19,884
The story is they drove it
all the way to Bensonhurst...

35
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:23,681
...but my father told me they
only got as far as Poughkeepsie.

36
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:30,021
Carlo Gambino, he came out of it...

boss of all bosses...

00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:28,420
BEN: This was the wrong time.
- I got him up from $150.

317
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:30,380
- I'm proud of you.
- I feel like a new man.

318
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,798
I'm so happy.

319
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:35,177
I know you're upset about the car,
but you can't come in here.

320
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:37,429
This is a patient's private session.

321
00:17:40,683 --> 00:17:41,808
VITTI:
You know me?

322
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:44,103
- Yes.
- No, you don't.

323
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,442
You see my picture in the paper?

324
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,110
- Yes.
- No, you didn't.

325
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,362
I don't even get the paper.

326
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,870
Jelly, wait outside.

327
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,581
Sit down.

328
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,380
- You ain't got no bugs in here?
- Bugs?

329
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,134
Bugs. Recording equipment.

330
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,970
No. I don't record. I take notes.

331
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,142
I tried to give him the insurance
information several times.

332
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,978
Seriously, several times.
He wouldn't take it.

333
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,980
Please don't kill me.

334
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,775
I was going to ask you
if you liked Tony Bennett.

335
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,654
I'm a big Tony Bennett fan.

336
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,907
- Me too.
- I like all Italian singers.

337
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,369
Mr. Vitti,
I know it's not your fault...

338
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,372
...but shouldn't we take this up
with our insurance companies?

339
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,875
It ain't about that.
I don't care about the car.

340
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:48,169
I got a friend of mine...

341
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:52,340
He's got problems, and he'll
have to probably see a shrink.

342
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,300
So I'll ask you
a couple of questions.

343
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,427
Oh. Go ahead, then.

344
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,431
What do we do?
What, we sit?

345
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:02,392
Whatever makes you comfortable.

346
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,685
I'll sit over here.

347
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,355
I'm going to sit here.

348
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,732
If you're comfortable, it's fine.

349
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,283
So who starts?

350
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,536
Tell me why you think
you need therapy.

351
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,498
I don't need therapy.
I told you that. It's for my friend.

352
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,458
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't hear me say that?

353
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:28,668
I'm sorry.

354
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:32,755
You're supposed to be good at listening.
You can't remember what I said?

355
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:34,173
So sorry.

356
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:37,927
I ain't thrilled with the level of service
up to this point.

357
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,431
- That was my fault. I apologize.
- Yeah.

358
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,058
Why don't we start over?

359
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,729
Why don't you just tell me
about your friend?

360
00:19:48,857 --> 00:19:52,568
This friend, you know,
he's a very powerful guy.

361
00:19:52,736 --> 00:19:54,445
Never had trouble
dealing with nothing.

362
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:56,989
All of a sudden, he's falling apart...

363
00:19:57,157 --> 00:20:00,075
...he cries for no reason,
he can't sleep...

364
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:02,077
...he can't be with his friends.

365
00:20:02,245 --> 00:20:04,663
All of a sudden,
he gets nervous around them.

366
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:06,498
He wants to get away from them.

367
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:09,710
And these are guys he knows
his whole life, you know?

368
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,837
And then he has these attacks.

369
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:16,133
He can't breathe, he gets dizzy...

370
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:18,678
...chest pains, you know...

371
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:21,598
He thinks he's gonna
die or something.

372
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:22,974
Panic attacks.

373
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:24,976
What's it with you guys
and panic attacks?

374
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:28,104
Who said "panic"?
Who said "panic"?

375
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:29,397
Not panic.

376
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:32,108
Dizzy, chest-breathing,
constricting...

377
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:34,110
...attacks.

378
00:20:34,362 --> 00:20:37,989
This guy, he just wants to know
what he can do to make it stop.

379
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:43,870
Mr. Vitti,
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

380
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:47,792
I think your friend...

381
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,169
...is you.

382
00:20:54,841 --> 00:20:58,511
You. You...

383
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:01,555
You got a gift, my friend.

384
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:03,891
You got a gift.

385
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:05,476
Oh, yeah.

386
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:08,437
You saw that there was something
I was trying to do...

387
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:11,190
...and figured it out.
That's why you are who you are.

388
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:13,609
God bless you.
You got a fucking gift.

389
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:17,530
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

390
00:21:19,157 --> 00:21:20,533
Go on.

391
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,827
- What?
- Go on.

392
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:24,286
I think...

393
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:26,831
...medication could help.

394
00:21:26,998 --> 00:21:28,207
Drugs?

395
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,251
Can't do drugs.
I don't do drugs.

396
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:34,004
If you want to get to
the root of the problem...

397
00:21:34,172 --> 00:21:36,006
...you'll want to get
some form of therapy.

398
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:38,217
Like what?
With you or something?

399
00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:41,512
Me? No, I don't think you want...

400
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:44,473
My roster of patients is full.

401
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:48,227
I'm full right now.
Plus, I'm leaving on a short vacation.

402
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:49,729
Where you going?

403
00:21:49,897 --> 00:21:52,107
- I don't share that with patients.
- Where?

404
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:54,901
Sheraton Bal Harbor Hotel
in Miami Beach.

405
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:56,653
That wasn't so hard, was it?

406
00:21:56,863 --> 00:21:58,363
No, it wasn't.

407
00:22:01,617 --> 00:22:04,077
You know, it's a funny
kind of a thing...

408
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:07,539
...but I feel better after
I got all that off my chest.

409
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:09,291
I feel like a load...

410
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:11,460
...a load is off my shoulders.

411
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:14,296
- You're good.
- I...

412
00:22:14,464 --> 00:22:15,672
Doc, thank you.

413
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:18,467
- I didn't do anything.
- You did.

414
00:22:18,718 --> 00:22:19,968
- I did nothing.
- You did too.

415
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:22,430
The load, gone. Where is it?

416
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:23,931
Don't know.

417
00:22:24,975 --> 00:22:26,726
You're good. Nah, nah.

418
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:28,728
You're good, Doc.

419
00:22:29,062 --> 00:22:31,022
I'll be getting in touch with you.

420
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:33,566
- Don't, please.
- One more thing.

421
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:35,568
If I talk to you...

422
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:39,572
...and you turn me into a fag,
I'll kill you. Understand?

423
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,283
Could we define "fag"?
Because some feelings...

424
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,785
...may come up.
- I go fag, you die. Got it?

425
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:46,913
Simple.

426
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,331
You're good, Doc.

427
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,416
You're good.

428
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,963
- See you, Doc.
- Mm-hm.

429
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:10,103
We take on Manetta,
what does Vitti do? Nothing.

430
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:11,605
Why doesn't he move?

431
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:12,898
SINDONE:
Fuck him.

432
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:15,901
You say "fuck him,"
but he's planning something big.

433
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,236
This shit's coming down.

434
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:19,279
Well then,
let it come down.

435
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:21,114
Let me tell you,
Vitti's a tough guy...

436
00:23:21,282 --> 00:23:24,993
...but a lot of tough guys get fed to
the crabs off Red Hook.

437
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:28,830
Vitti. That name has been
haunting me since I was a kid.

438
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,959
Growing up, he was the smart guy,
I was the dope.

439
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:35,254
My father was a nickel-and-dime
shitheel, his had it all.

440
00:23:35,463 --> 00:23:37,631
Vito Genovese blew it at Apalachin...

441
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,884
...because he forgot to kill
Gambino before the meeting.

442
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:44,012
I won't make that same mistake.
I want Paul Vitti dead!

443
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:47,849
You hear me? I want him dead.
Not breathing now. Dead!

444
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:49,977
Okay, okay, okay.

445
00:23:50,144 --> 00:23:51,895
Like the pants?

446
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,731
They look great.
He's some tailor.

447
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:56,568
- I'll tell you. Look good.
- I like them.

448
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,909
Don't leave food in your room.
I won't come home to a science fair.

449
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,578
I didn't.

450
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,831
- Dad, one thing, though.
- Yeah?

451
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:11,416
- "I go fag, you die."
- That's it.

452
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,209
I'm sealing the vent
in your room.

453
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,169
You cannot listen to my sessions!

454
00:24:15,337 --> 00:24:17,964
It's so cool.
Was that really Paul Vitti?

455
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:21,426
I didn't ask to see his
Mafia decoder ring, but it was him.

456
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:24,763
- Are you going to treat him?
- Of course not. Are you crazy?

457
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:29,184
And, Michael, you cannot tell anybody
that he was here. Understand?

458
00:24:29,394 --> 00:24:31,186
- Should I take it off the Internet?
- What?

459
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:33,063
- Michael!
- I'm kidding.

460
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,615
WOMAN [ON TV]: Despite the heat
and the popularity...

461
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,700
...of more exotic Caribbean destinations...

462
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:48,120
...Florida's hospitality industry
reports booming business...

463
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,080
...from Orlando to the Keys.

464
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,624
Judging from the mob...

465
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,167
...around the pool here today...

466
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:57,422
...there's nothing off about the off-season
in Miami Beach this summer.

467
00:24:57,632 --> 00:25:01,926
On a personal note,
this is my last report for WVBF.

468
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:04,971
I'm marrying a wonderful man,
and I'm moving to New York.

469
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:06,890
Thanks for everything, Miami.

470
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:10,977
For the last time, this is
Laura MacNamara for WVBF.

Let's do it. I'm ready.

627
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:43,565
You don't hear the word "no" very often.

628
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:47,027
I hear it all the time,
only it's more, "No, please, no, no."

629
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:49,363
I'm here for two more days.

630
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:52,825
When I get back to New York,
I'll treat you exclusively.

631
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:54,827
For two weeks.

632
00:32:54,994 --> 00:32:57,079
I just don't know what
to tell my patients.

633
00:32:57,288 --> 00:32:59,039
- You want me to clear your schedule?
- Oh, no.

634
00:32:59,207 --> 00:33:02,000
It would be my honor to do that.
My pleasure. Jimmy?

635
00:33:02,168 --> 00:33:04,670
No. No, not Jimmy.
I will do this myself.

636
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:06,004

- Positive.

637

Good night.
I'll see you in New York.

Ben? Where were you?

652
00:33:40,624 --> 00:33:42,584
My God, I woke up
and you were gone!

653
00:33:42,793 --> 00:33:45,461
There was no note or anything!
I was out of my mind!

654
00:33:45,671 --> 00:33:47,922
I walked all over the hotel
looking for you.

655
00:33:48,132 --> 00:33:51,217
I even ate a Rice Krispy Treat.
I almost called the police.

656
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:54,304
No, don't call the police.
I'll tell you the truth.

657
00:33:54,513 --> 00:33:56,431
I had a patient emergency.

658
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,725
You have patients in Florida?

659
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:02,604

I had to go, trust me.

My God. Who is this patient?

661
00:34:06,942 --> 00:34:10,487
Paul Vitti.

662
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:14,033

- Yeah.

Yes.

Listen. It's not like
he's a regular patient.

666
00:34:23,835 --> 00:34:25,794
- He's got problems.
- Well, yeah.

667
00:34:25,962 --> 00:34:28,672
He thinks that I'm treating him.
It's crazy.

668
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,466
- So you're not treating him?
- No.

669

Tell me you're not.

670
00:34:32,093 --> 00:34:33,302
I'm not treating him.

671
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:36,513
It's scary. You don't want
someone like that in your life.

I've covered the mob down here.
I've seen what they do.

He understood. It's over.

- Absolutely.

Okay.

...saw an ex-girlfriend
or something.

Of course he passed away.

It was a sudden thing.
A heart attack.

How was the relationship?
Were you close?

Eh, we were pretty close.

We weren't getting along great
right then.

Why is that?

763
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,096
I was hanging out in the neighborhood.
I had a borgata.

764

What is that?

765
00:38:41,724 --> 00:38:44,225
A kid gang, nothing big.
But he didn't like that.

00:38:44,393 --> 00:38:45,644
- He didn't approve.
- No, no.

767
00:38:45,812 --> 00:38:48,147
He slapped me around
a couple of times.

768
00:38:48,482 --> 00:38:49,648
And what?

769
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:51,150
And then he died.

770
00:38:51,735 --> 00:38:53,569
How'd that make you feel?

771
00:38:53,737 --> 00:38:56,280
It felt great, wonderful.
How'd it make me feel?

772
00:38:56,448 --> 00:38:57,573
Think about it.

773
00:38:57,741 --> 00:39:00,951
Were you angry?
Were you afraid? Sad?

774
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,120
Maybe all those things.

775
00:39:03,288 --> 00:39:04,914
Any feelings of guilt?

776
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:06,457
About what? I didn't kill him.

777
00:39:06,666 --> 00:39:08,334
I know that,
I'm just speculating...

778
00:39:08,502 --> 00:39:12,505
...that maybe in some way
you may have wanted him to die.

779
00:39:12,714 --> 00:39:14,173
Why would I want him to die?

780
00:39:14,382 --> 00:39:17,302
You said you were fighting.
He slapped you around...

781
00:39:17,512 --> 00:39:19,721
...because you rebelled
against his authority.

782
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:21,765
Maybe some unresolved
Oedipal conflict.

Oedipus was a Greek king who killed
his father and married his mother.

It's an instinctual developmental drive.

The young boy wants to
replace his father...

788
00:39:33,986 --> 00:39:36,446
...so that he can
totally possess his mother.

Are you saying
I wanted to fuck my mother?

790
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:42,160
- It's a primal fantasy.
- Have you ever seen my mother?

791
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,621
- Are you out of your mind?
- It's Freud!

too for bringing it up.

I feel like I'm having one now.
Why'd you interrupt my party?

00:55:49,944 --> 00:55:51,361
Sorry.

1091
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:01,955
[WHISPERING] You look lousy.
You all right?

1092
00:56:02,122 --> 00:56:06,209
Yeah, I'm all right.
Listen, Paul, don't send me any more gifts.

1093
00:56:06,418 --> 00:56:10,797
- You didn't like the fountain?
- It's a boundary issue.

1094
00:56:11,006 --> 00:56:13,883
If more people gave from the heart,
we'd all be better off.

1095
00:56:14,093 --> 00:56:17,470
Let me see your watch.
Piece ofjunk. You're getting a Rolex.

1096
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,348
- Don't buy me one.
- Who said anything about buying?

1097
00:56:20,558 --> 00:56:22,892
Paul, listen.
I really have to talk to you.

1098
00:56:32,736 --> 00:56:34,153
Who is that?

1099
00:56:35,114 --> 00:56:39,242
Tommy Angels. We grew up together.
Worked for a crew out of Jersey City.

1100
00:56:39,827 --> 00:56:42,829
- How did he die?
PRIEST: All rise.

1101
00:56:43,665 --> 00:56:46,500
He was on his way to talk
to a federal prosecutor.

1102
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,586
Got hit by a truck.

1103
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,462
Twice.

1104
00:56:51,172 --> 00:56:52,381
I don't need to know this.

1105
00:56:52,591 --> 00:56:53,841
I can't hear this.

1106
00:56:55,135 --> 00:56:58,012
This is too much for me.
I'm having nightmares myself.

1107
00:56:58,179 --> 00:57:01,307
The other night, I dreamed you and I
were walking down the street...

1108
00:57:01,516 --> 00:57:03,017
...and I stopped to buy some fruit.

1109
00:57:03,184 --> 00:57:05,769
Out of nowhere, two guys
come and they kill me...

1110
00:57:06,021 --> 00:57:09,189
...like Marlon Brando
in The Godfather.

1111
00:57:10,275 --> 00:57:12,693
Good scene. What'd I do?

1112
00:57:12,861 --> 00:57:14,029
You drop your gun.

1113
00:57:14,238 --> 00:57:17,741
You run up to me and you
yell, "Papa! Papa!"

1114
00:57:18,159 --> 00:57:19,534
I was Fredo?

1115
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:21,578
I don't think so.

1116
00:57:23,122 --> 00:57:25,915
You're starting to lose it.
You may need therapy yourself.

1117
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:29,711
- Paul, we really have to talk. This is...
PRIEST: All rise.

1118
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,714
BEN:
We're running out of time.

1119
00:57:51,318 --> 00:57:52,485
The widow.

1120
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:54,320
I'm very sorry.

1121
00:57:55,614 --> 00:57:56,739
The daughter.

1122
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:58,157
I'm sorry.

1123
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:04,121
- Brother.
- My condolences.

1124
00:58:10,128 --> 00:58:11,587
I'm very sorry.

1125
00:58:29,523 --> 00:58:31,023
Him I don't know.

1126
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,988
Can we talk now?

1127
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:46,289
[IN NORMAL TONE] Don't you see? You
called me Papa. This is all about your father.

1128
00:58:46,457 --> 00:58:48,333
[IN NORMAL TONE]
You're nuts. That's your dream.

1129
00:58:48,501 --> 00:58:50,669
But the black-milk dream
is also about your father.

1130
00:58:50,878 --> 00:58:53,880
I don't buy that. In my dream,
I'm bringing the baby the black milk.

1131
00:58:54,132 --> 00:58:56,508
Freud believed you're everyone
in your dreams.

1132
00:58:56,718 --> 00:58:58,635
Fuck Freud.
After what you told me...

1133
00:58:58,845 --> 00:59:01,388
...I'm afraid to call
my mother on the telephone.

1134
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,807
Listen, just try to go with me here.

1135
00:59:04,016 --> 00:59:06,143
Let's just say that you are the baby.

1136
00:59:06,394 --> 00:59:08,145
What kind of milk did
your father bring you?

1137
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:09,813
Could we stop talking about
my father?

1138
00:59:09,981 --> 00:59:13,692
No. That's the point.
We have to talk about your father.

1139
00:59:13,901 --> 00:59:16,194
It is so hard to...
You know what you're like?

1140
00:59:16,404 --> 00:59:18,364
Like this:
"Doc, you got to help me.

1141
00:59:18,574 --> 00:59:20,158
I'm in pain.
Please help me."

1142
00:59:20,325 --> 00:59:23,161
"All right, Paul, I'll help."
"Fuck you. Nobody helps Paul Vitti."

1143
00:59:23,328 --> 00:59:25,413
All right, very good. This is you:

1144
00:59:25,622 --> 00:59:27,915
"Oh. That's interesting.
What does that mean to you?

1145
00:59:28,584 --> 00:59:29,834
Anger is a blocked wish."

1146
00:59:30,085 --> 00:59:32,086
Boo-fucking-hoo-hoo.

1147
00:59:32,296 --> 00:59:34,380
- Let's talk about your father.
- Let's not.

1148
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:35,840
What does your father do?

1149
00:59:36,008 --> 00:59:37,133
It's not important.

1150
00:59:37,342 --> 00:59:39,427
- What? You paused.
- I did not.

1151
00:59:39,636 --> 00:59:42,680
You just paused. That means you
had a feeling. A thought.

1152
00:59:42,848 --> 00:59:44,849
What does your father do?
What's he do?

1153
00:59:45,184 --> 00:59:47,435
- He's a psychiatrist.
- A psychiatrist?

1154
00:59:47,687 --> 00:59:49,354
Oh.

1155
00:59:49,522 --> 00:59:52,191
Now I know why you're fucked up.
Next patient, please.

1156
00:59:52,525 --> 00:59:53,859
We are running out of time.

1157
00:59:54,027 --> 00:59:56,028
Let's not waste it on my problems.

1158
00:59:56,196 --> 00:59:57,362
- Your father's a problem?
- No.

1159
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,530
- That's what you said.
- I did not!

1160
00:59:58,782 --> 01:00:00,949
- Now you're upset.
- I am not upset!

1161
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:02,284
- Yes, you are.
- Stop it!

1162
01:00:02,494 --> 01:00:03,744
I'm getting good at this.

1163
01:00:03,912 --> 01:00:08,040
Paul, we only have a few days left.
This is very important stuff.

1164
01:00:08,249 --> 01:00:10,292
That's why you're acting like this.

1165
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:12,544
If you want to spend it
screwing around, I can't help you.

1166
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:14,963
Call me when you want
to get serious.

1167
01:00:15,131 --> 01:00:16,757
I am serious.

1168
01:00:16,925 --> 01:00:19,218
Hey. Don't you want to
analyze me no more?

1169
01:00:19,385 --> 01:00:21,637
Doc, doc, doc.

1170
01:00:21,805 --> 01:00:23,055
Say hello to your father for me.

1171
01:00:28,978 --> 01:00:31,063
MASIELLO [ON RECORDING]:
It's time to end it, Paul.

1172
01:00:31,231 --> 01:00:32,731
VITTI [ON RECORDING]:
What do you mean, end it?

1173
01:00:32,899 --> 01:00:35,400
MASIELLO: Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much already.

1174
01:00:35,568 --> 01:00:37,110
VITTI:
You want me to whack my doctor?

1175
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:41,156
MASIELLO: If you don't do it,
somebody else will. That's the way it is.

1176
01:00:41,324 --> 01:00:42,616
VITTI:
Nobody touches this guy.

1177
01:00:42,826 --> 01:00:45,410
Anybody lays a finger on him,
I'm gonna kill them.

1178
01:00:45,578 --> 01:00:47,246
Understood?

1179
01:00:48,248 --> 01:00:49,833
Now let's hear the other one.

1180
01:00:50,918 --> 01:00:52,418
VITTI:
You want me to whack my doctor?

1181
01:00:52,586 --> 01:00:55,755
MASIELLO: If you don't do it,
somebody else will. That's the way it is.

1182
01:00:55,923 --> 01:00:57,799
VITTI:
I'm gonna kill them.

1183
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,511
- Good.
- That's very good.

1184
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,389
MASIELLO:
We think it's time to end it.

1185
01:01:04,598 --> 01:01:05,640
VITTI:
What do you mean?

1186
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:08,726
MASIELLO: Get rid of the shrink.
He knows too much already.

1187
01:01:08,936 --> 01:01:10,436
VITTI:
You want me to whack my doctor?

1188
01:01:10,604 --> 01:01:13,940
MASIELLO: If you don't do it,
somebody else will. That's the way it is.

1189
01:01:14,108 --> 01:01:15,650
VITTI:
I'm gonna kill them.

1190
01:01:20,198 --> 01:01:21,740
What do you want me to do?

1191
01:01:24,953 --> 01:01:27,162
MASIELLO:
Paul, he's talking to the feds.

1192
01:01:27,372 --> 01:01:30,124
I know this guy. He wouldn't
talk to the feds. No way.

1193
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:34,128
The FBI was over at his house today.
Jimmy Boots saw them.

1194
01:01:34,588 --> 01:01:36,964
VITTI: You saw them there?
- It's the truth. I saw them.

1195
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:38,716
Next, you'll get a call...

1196
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:40,885
...and he'll want a meeting.

1197
01:01:41,052 --> 01:01:42,636
JELLY:
Hey, Paul.

1198
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:44,597
Dr. Sobel called.

1199
01:01:44,806 --> 01:01:47,266
He said he needs to see you
right away.

1200
01:01:50,061 --> 01:01:53,565
MAN [SINGING OVER SPEAKERS]:
If our lips should meet

1201
01:01:53,733 --> 01:01:57,068
Innamorata

1202
01:01:57,236 --> 01:01:58,737
This is delicious.

1203
01:01:58,946 --> 01:02:00,405
This is so good.

1204
01:02:00,823 --> 01:02:02,324
I love Italian food.

1205
01:02:02,575 --> 01:02:04,951
I've never been to Italy. Is it great?

1206
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,745
I was in France twice...

1207
01:02:06,913 --> 01:02:09,873
...and Jamaica, the island.
You ever been there?

1208
01:02:10,082 --> 01:02:12,042
It's great,
because I love to snorkel.

1209
01:02:12,209 --> 01:02:15,337
Have you guys ever snorkeled?
It's great to sleep with the fish.

1210
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:17,589
Swim with the fish.
Have you ever done that?

1211
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:19,758
It's good. So...

1212
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:22,344
...what are you doing this summer?

1213
01:02:22,511 --> 01:02:24,220
About what?

1214
01:02:25,181 --> 01:02:27,432
- Hey, Carlo.
- How are you?

1215
01:02:28,976 --> 01:02:31,186
- Jelly. Good.
- How you doing?

1216
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:34,189
This is Ben. Say hello to Carlo.

1217
01:02:34,357 --> 01:02:36,232
- Carlo. Carlo...?
- How you doing?

1218
01:02:36,442 --> 01:02:38,652
That's it. Grab a seat.

1219
01:02:41,864 --> 01:02:43,698
Carlo and I grew up together.

1220
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:45,909
He's like, I would say, almost...

1221
01:02:46,118 --> 01:02:48,036
...like a cousin to me.

1222
01:02:48,204 --> 01:02:50,580
- I am your cousin.
- That's what I'm saying.

1223
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:52,875
It's a family thing.
It's the closeness.

1224
01:02:53,043 --> 01:02:56,087
Anything he needs, anything I can
do for him, I'm here for him.

1225
01:02:56,296 --> 01:02:57,630
- You know that.
- I know.

1226
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,632
Did you take care of that thing?

1227
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,594
- It's all right to talk business?
- It's okay.

1228
01:03:03,762 --> 01:03:05,304
- I took care of it.
- And the other?

1229
01:03:05,514 --> 01:03:08,641
I got to wait for the first
before I can move on the second.

1230
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,476
The guy give you a problem?

1231
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:13,562
The guy in the first thing?
He's a lunatic.

1232
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:15,398
- What did he say?
- The usual.

1233
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:17,149
You told him you weren't doing it?

1234
01:03:17,317 --> 01:03:18,484
CARLO:
What am I going to do?

1235
01:03:18,652 --> 01:03:20,486
VITTI:
Got to nip that shit in the bud.

1236
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:23,281
CARLO: But if the first comes through,
that'll fix everything.

1237
01:03:23,491 --> 01:03:26,368
Including the second thing.
Exactly.

1238
01:03:27,495 --> 01:03:29,746
Don't repeat what you hear here.
You hear?

1239
01:03:30,331 --> 01:03:32,165
The first thing

01:38:56,841 --> 01:39:02,012
Any time I move my finger

1860
01:39:03,055 --> 01:39:07,475
Lucky me, can't you see?

1861
01:39:07,643 --> 01:39:10,187
I'm in love

1862
01:39:12,356 --> 01:39:16,443
Life is a beautiful thing

1863
01:39:18,613 --> 01:39:22,449
As long as I hold that string

1864
01:39:25,328 --> 01:39:28,788
I'd be a silly so-and-so

1865
01:39:31,042 --> 01:39:34,502
If I should ever let go

1866
01:39:38,591 --> 01:39:41,843
I've got the world on a string

1867
01:39:42,345 --> 01:39:46,097
I'm sitting on a rainbow

1868
01:39:46,265 --> 01:39:51,562
I've got the string around my finger

1869
01:39:52,231 --> 01:39:56,275
What a world, what a life

1870
01:39:56,443 --> 01:40:03,449
I'm in love

1871
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:06,327
Good night, Sobels.

1872
01:43:24,739 --> 01:43:26,740
