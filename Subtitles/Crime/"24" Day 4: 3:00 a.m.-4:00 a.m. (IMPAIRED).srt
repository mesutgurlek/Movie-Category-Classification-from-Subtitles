Previously On 24

00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:16,868
People of America: You wake
up today to a different world.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,029
One of your own nuclear weapons
has been used against you.

8
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:24,260
"You wake up today to a different world.

9
00:00:24,295 --> 00:00:25,362
" Do we take that literally?

10
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,386
That he'll set off the warhead before dawn?

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,802
A CTU analyst named Chloe
O'Brian secured a hard

12
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:33,519
drive belonging to one
of Marwan's associates.

13
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:38,283
This hard drive may contain information
that could lead us to the warhead.

14
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:42,176
I will give you full authority to act as
my proxy whenever you think it's necessary.

15
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:46,727
Mr. Koo, there's a man in your
consulate by the name of Lee Jong.

16
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:50,415
We need to take Mr. Lee into
custody immediately for questioning.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,029
But Mr. Lee is a Chinese citizen.

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,347
I can't just hand him over to you
without going through channels.

19
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:59,539
Jack, is there any doubt in your
mind that Lee is working with Marwan?

20
00:01:00,542 --> 00:01:01,109
No,
sir--

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,219
the e-mails he sent left no room for doubt.

22
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,658
Then we have to get Lee out
now and find out what he knows.

23
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:06,641
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:09,962
No one connected with the government can
admit to knowing anything about this...

25
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:10,977
ever!

26
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:11,728
Got him!

27
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,769
Hostiles in pursuit. Bring up the van.

28
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:23,687
Mr. President, the consul is dead.

29
00:01:23,873 --> 00:01:26,549
He was shot when armed men broke into this

30
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,543
building and took Mr.
Lee with them by force.

31
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:32,222
Mr. Lee, tell me where Habib Marwan is.

32
00:01:32,476 --> 00:01:33,417
Damn it, we're losing him!

33
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:35,312
Paul, what is it?

34
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:39,174
I can drain off some of the fluid but
we need to get him back into surgery now.

35
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:41,934
Jack...

36
00:01:42,506 --> 00:01:43,448
Jack, what's going on?

37
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,900
This man is our only connection
to a stolen nuclear warhead.

38
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:47,024
You've got to save him now.

39
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:48,114
I already have a patient!

40
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:48,989
You have a new one!

41
00:01:49,254 --> 00:01:51,691
If you don't save him,
Billions of people will die.

42
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,448
Jack...

43
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:53,390
I have my orders.

44
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:54,298
I'm doing my job.

45
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:56,055
Paul's crashing.

46
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,985
Jack, he's dead.

47
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:01,712
Jack, you son of a bitch, you killed him.

48
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:12,007
The following takes place
between 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M.

49
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,000
Gauze.

50
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:17,800
Gauze.

51
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,700
Is he going to make it?

52
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,100
We're going to do the best we can.

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,285
I just need him coherent long
enough to get the information

54
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,700
about Marwan and the missing warhead.

55
00:02:24,735 --> 00:02:25,265
I know, Jack.

56
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,300
You already made me aware of that when you
forced me to sacrifice Paul Raines's life.

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,500
One milligram atropine!

58
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:31,965
What is it?

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
Jack, I don't have time right now.

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,100
Jack, we need to leave.

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,000
Let them do this.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,700
Gauze.

63
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll be right outside.

64
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,600
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
I'm so sorry.

66
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,900
How could you?

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
How could you kill him, Jack?

68
00:03:27,835 --> 00:03:28,800
How could you do it?

69
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,200
No...

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,465
No...

71
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,900
no... I can't...

72
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,000
I can't...

73
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,100
be there right now.

74
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Please, Audrey...

75
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,000
just tell me what you want me to do.

76
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,800
Leave.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,700
I want you to leave, Jack.

78
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,300
Jack, you need to call
the white house right away.

79
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:45,600
Mike Novick needs to speak with you.

80
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,500
It's urgent.

81
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,100
Okay, fine.

82
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,100
What?

83
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,300
Paul Raines just died.

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,600
There was only one doctor and I had to
make a choice between Lee's life and Paul'S.

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,600
A-and I chose Lee.

86
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,900
You did the right thing, Jack.

87
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,300
You okay?

88
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
No, I'm not okay.

89
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,400
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,200
Just tell me when Lee's out of surgery.

91
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:21,800
I will.

92
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Mike Novick's office.

93
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,200
This is Jack Bauer for Mike Novick.

94
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,500
Please hold.

95
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,300
Hello, Jack.

96
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,200
Have you gotten anything
useful out of Lee yet?

97
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,700
No, he's still in surgery.

98
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,800
How's that coming along?

99
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,900
Not great, but he's hanging in there.

100
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,150
I don't have to tell you we took
a huge risk getting this guy,

101
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:50,700
under the assumption that he can
help us find the nuclear warhead.

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Trust me, Mike, I know.

103
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,600
We also have a new situation.

104
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,100
What is it?

105
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,300
When you broke into the Chinese
consulate, Koo Yin, the consul, was shot.

106
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,765
That's not possible.

107
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,300
My men never fired their weapons.

108
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,900
Then he was accidentally
hit by one of his own people.

109
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,000
How badly was he hurt?

110
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
He died, Jack.

111
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,200
Oh, my god...

112
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,500
I want you to talk to
the members of your team.

113
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,900
Make sure that each one of them has an
alibi for where they were during the ambush.

114
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,000
Okay.

115
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,700
This is an extremely incendiary situation.

116
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,700
I'm about to talk to President Palmer now.

117
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,800
We're trying to avoid a serious
confrontation with China.

118
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,900
We'll handle it from here.

119
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,300
Thanks, Mike.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
How did this happen?

121
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,765
Mr. Buchanan, the network
security module lit up.

122
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,500
Someone on the outside is trying
to jam our satellite servers.

123
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
Could this just be a high network load?

124
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,400
No, it's definitely a
denial of service attempt.

125
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:11,300
What do you want me to do?

126
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,700
Do any damage yet?

127
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,565
No, the Cisco system is self-defending.

128
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,100
All right, have one of your people
use the security auditor tool.

129
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:18,500
Maybe it'll lead us to Marwan's network.

130
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:19,900
That was my point from the start.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,500
Chloe.

132
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
We're in an active code.

133
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,300
We don't have time for
your personality disorder.

134
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,200
Do you understand me?

135
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,900
Chloe?

136
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,800
Yes or no?

137
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,400
Yes, sir.

138
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,500
This is Yasir.

139
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,850
Is the warhead in place?

140
00:07:42,885 --> 00:07:44,042
Yes, but we have a problem.

141
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:45,200
I can't jam their satellite.

142
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,100
You assured me that you could handle it.

143
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,100
CTU must have just installed new software.

144
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,600
This wasn't in place last week.

145
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,400
We're going to have to move
our schedule forward by an hour.

146
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,400
There won't be as many casualties
if people aren't at work.

147
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,400
If you can't jam the satellite
signal, they'll find us.

148
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
We can't let that happen.

149
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,700
I understand.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,100
How long are we going to keep
the President in the dark?

151
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,500
Eventually he's going to find out that you
authorized a raid on the Chinese consulate.

152
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,600
We have to keep it from
him as long as we can.

153
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
Were you able to find Jack?

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,500
Yes. He's back at CTU.

155
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,100
The man they grabbed at the consulate,
Lee Jong, is still in surgery.

156
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,100
Was he able to tell us
anything about the warhead?

157
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,700
No.

158
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,800
What did Jack have to say about
the Chinese consul's death?

159
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,500
It wasn't our people who fired the shot.

160
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,500
The Chinese won't care.

161
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
He died as a result of our trespass.

162
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,809
We have to start
constructing a scenario that

163
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,800
doesn't implicate the
united states government.

164
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,700
They must know we did this.

165
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,100
We called the consulate about Lee
Jong half an hour before the abduction.

166
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,400
The Chinese don't want a
confrontation any more than we do.

167
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,600
If we can create a scenario of plausible
deniability, they may play along.

168
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,900
How do we do that?

169
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,000
Call CTU.

170
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,777
Have them find out which
anti-Chinese factions have attacked

171
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:11,500
their embassies or consulates
in the last five years.

172
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,300
Most of these groups you're
talking about are asian extremists.

173
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,900
I'm sure Bauer's team was
predominately americans.

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,500
Bauer's team was masked.

175
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,900
No one saw their faces.

176
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,000
They were all masked?

177
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,800
Yes.

178
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,300
Wait.

179
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,500
His mask was lifted.

180
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,800
Use the image processing filters.

181
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,800
OK

182
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Let me see.

183
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,700
Send this image to Beijing and Shanghai.

184
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,900
Have them cross-reference it
with our intelligence databases.

185
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,100
Find out who this man is.

186
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,400
I will.

187
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Curtis, come here.

188
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,400
Listen up.

189
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,400
The Chinese consul was shot and
killed during Lee's extraction.

190
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:54,600
How?

191
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,300
We never got a shot off.

192
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:56,200
I know, I know.

193
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,700
It must have been friendly fire.

194
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,300
But look, we've got to make
sure all our alibis cross check.

195
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,225
No one outside of this
operation is to know that

196
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:04,200
we were anywhere near the
Chinese consulate tonight.

197
00:11:04,235 --> 00:11:05,000
Understood?

198
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Jack, what's gonna happen?

199
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Are we going to be brought into this?

200
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,200
I don't know yet.

201
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,900
All I do know is now that the consul's
been killed, everything has changed.

202
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,809
It's our responsibility to
make sure that the united

203
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,400
states government is never
implicated in this operation.

204
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:18,200
Don't worry, Jack.

205
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,200
Everyone here gets it.

206
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:20,900
Okay.

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
Curtis, you advise the rest of the team.

208
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,300
You got it.

209
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,600
Yasir.

210
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,800
They're ready for you to make the changes.

211
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,600
Do you think they'll
find it before we launch?

212
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,000
Not if I move up the launch time.

213
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,200
They're looking for the
warhead in their cities.

214
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,800
They have no idea that it's
going to be delivered by missile.

215
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,300
Morrison?

216
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:50,800
Yes, sir.

217
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,400
Open up the guidance firmware.

218
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,300
I'm going to upload a new instruction set.

219
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,900
Yes, sir.

220
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,200
Okay, go ahead.

221
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,204
All right, you'll be
ready to start the launch

222
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:14,200
sequence as soon as we've
reprogrammed the onboard.

223
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,000
Good.

224
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,500
Jack, prep all your databases.

225
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,400
When Lee comes to, we're
gonna have to move quickly.

226
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:36,217
What about the warhead?

227
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:37,000
We're meeting on it now.

228
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,400
Chloe, I need you to free up a server
for a large D.O.D.Block transfer--

229
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:43,400
it'll be coming through a locked
channel from Heller's office.

230
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Has that been authorized?

231
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
No, not yet, I still have to talk to Audrey.

232
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,900
That's gonna be weird.

233
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,300
What?

234
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,600
Talking to Audrey, I mean, you had to
do what you did and her husband died.

235
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,600
It's probably destroyed
your relationship with her.

236
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:01,200
Chloe, please, just free up the server.

237
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,900
Okay.

238
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,005
Jack, I just want you
to know that if you need

239
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:09,200
anyone to talk to as a
friend, I'm here for you.

240
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,700
Not now, but later, when things calm down.

241
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,400
Thanks.

242
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,800
Audrey, I'm sorry to bother you.

243
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,300
I need you to call Marcy,
authorize a block transfer.

244
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,800
We need all pertinent D.O.D.

245
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:33,100
Databases sent over here to CTU.

246
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,900
Were you able to keep Lee alive?

247
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,500
Yeah, he's stabilized.

248
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,800
All right.

249
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,400
I'll call Marcy.

250
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,000
Thank you.

251
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,600
Now the warhead was stolen
here, in eastern Iowa.

252
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,000
We don't yet know how it's being transported

253
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,500
Are we monitoring air traffic?

254
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,400
Yes-- so far nothing's
been picked up.

255
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,200
Well, if they have to stay on the
ground, how far could they have gone?

256
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,647
Based on our latest information, 300-mile

257
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:06,900
radius, which includes
three metropolitan areas.

258
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,300
Have those cities been alerted?

259
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,200
The President wants to keep that
information restricted for the time being.

260
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,000
We have raised local alert levels,
but haven't mentioned specifics.

261
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,100
Marwan and his people have
control of the nuclear warhead.

262
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,000
We have to figure out when and
where he's going to set it off.

263
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,800
I want you looking at everything--
from satellite to local police.

264
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
We have a small window.

265
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,200
It's still the middle of the night.

266
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,100
If Marwan leaves a trail,

267
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,016
it's going to be a hell of
a lot easier to follow it

268
00:14:31,017 --> 00:14:32,900
now than in two hours when
people start going to work.

269
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Let's get to it.

270
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,200
[Mandarin]

271
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,300
We think this is the
man you asked us to find.

272
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
But you're not sure.

273
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,900
There was a good match on a lot
of the available characteristics.

274
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
Howard Bern.

275
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,800
Member of a tactical
unit for CTU Los Angeles

276
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,300
What are you going to do?

277
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:55,200
Talk to him.

278
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,000
How? CTU won't let you anywhere near him.

279
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,385
They'll have to. It would
be a diplomatic mistake

280
00:15:00,386 --> 00:15:01,900
for them not to cooperate
under the circumstance .

281
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,000
[Mandarin]

282
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,700
Get me the head of CTU Los Angeles.

283
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,600
[Mandarin]

284
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,000
There's a program at division you
can filter those markers through.

285
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
It'll tell you which ones are good.

286
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,200
Yeah?

287
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,400
I've got a Mr. Cheng from the Chinese
consulate who wants to speak to Michelle.

288
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,800
This is Michelle Dessler.

289
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,300
Ms. Dessler, my name is Cheng Zhi, head
of security for the Chinese consulate.

290
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,100
I'm sure your office is aware of the
incident that happened here earlier tonight.

291
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,300
Yes, we were very sorry to hear about it.

292
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,300
Is there anything we can do to help?

293
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
I would like to come over and
discuss this matter with you.

294
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,400
Of course.

295
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,300
My office would be more than glad to make
an appointment with you in the morning.

296
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,900
No, I need to do that right now.

297
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,800
I'm afraid that's impossible.

298
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,865
You must know we're in the middle
of a national security crisis.

299
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,900
The murder of a Chinese consul on Chinese
soil could be construed as an act of war.

300
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,200
What does that have to do with us?

301
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,400
I believe your agency stormed the
consulate and kidnapped Lee Jong.

302
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That is an outrageous accusation.

303
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,843
Just an hour earlier, your government called

304
00:16:11,844 --> 00:16:14,400
and asked for permission
to speak to Lee Jong.

305
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,600
30 minutes later we were attacked.

306
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,700
It is unlikely these
two events are unrelated.

307
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
I'm sorry, Mr. Cheng, I can't help you.

308
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,200
I suggest you cooperate voluntarily.

309
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,100
Otherwise, I'll be forced
to go above you on this.

310
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,500
I'm sure you'll do what you have to.

311
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,000
I mean no disrespect, but I
do have to get back to work.

312
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,000
Very well, Ms. Dessler.

313
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,800
You'll be hearing from me soon.

314
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,700
[Mandarin]

315
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,900
Get me Secretary of State Taylor

316
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,500
Tell him it's an urgent matter.

317
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:49,400
[Mandarin]

318
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,700
Comm just confirmed that we got
the data from Marcy, thank you.

319
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,200
You're welcome.

320
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,900
Yeah.

321
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,000
Audrey, you should get some rest.

322
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,000
With everything that's going on, I can't.

323
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,400
You could go back to the hotel.

324
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,400
Jack, please don't tell me what to do.

325
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,300
What?

326
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,600
Jack, what do you want from me?

327
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,300
You made a choice that killed Paul,
and I'm trying to deal with it.

328
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,600
We both have a job, let's just do it.

329
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:36,700
Jack.

330
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,600
Michelle says the head of security
at the Chinese consulate just called.

331
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,700
What?

332
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,400
He made it sound like he has evidence
linking CTU to the abduction of Lee.

333
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:46,300
What kind of evidence?

334
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,400
He didn't say, but he wants to
come down here and talk to us.

335
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,300
They don't have any
evidence, they're bluffing.

336
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,500
Bill, we don't have time
to deal with them right now.

337
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,200
I agree, but we don't have much choice.

338
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I need you to help me figure
out how to deal with this, Jack.

339
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,000
I need to check on Lee's condition first.

340
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:01,700
I'll get back to you.

341
00:18:01,735 --> 00:18:02,200
All right

342
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,200
CTU just sent this over.

343
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,218
These five groups have all made
attempts to attack or sabotage

344
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:19,900
Chinese targets around the
globe in the last two years.

345
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,200
This group here...

346
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
people's freedom coalition?

347
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,109
They've actually made
speeches where they referenced

348
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,700
Lee Jong's involvement with
the Chinese nuclear program.

349
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,688
So an attack on the consulate and the grab

350
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:31,800
of Lee Jong by this
group would be plausible.

351
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,800
It would allow the Chinese to save face.

352
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,721
And if the Chinese can't
provide proof that we entered

353
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:38,700
the consulate, saving
face may be all they need.

354
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,900
If you want, I can start
leaking it to the media.

355
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,500
Do it.

356
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,200
Mr. President.

357
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
David, what have you done?

358
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,800
Excuse me, sir?

359
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,519
I just got a call from the
secretary of state telling me about

360
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,900
a covert action against the
Chinese consulate in Los Angeles.

361
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,300
That's correct.

362
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,100
I sanctioned it.

363
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,200
Why would you have done such a thing?

364
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,965
It was the only option at the time.

365
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,400
Don't you know how fragile our
relationship with China is right now?

366
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,100
You authorized an attack on their consulate!

367
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:07,367
That's a military engagement.

368
00:19:07,402 --> 00:19:08,565
It was a covert operation,

369
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,323
not dissimilar to those carried out by

370
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:12,500
countries on a routine
basis around the world.

371
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,365
Don't give me a social
studies lesson, David.

372
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,700
We marched onto Chinese soil, we
kidnapped one of their nationals

373
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:20,100
and in the process the
Chinese consul was killed.

374
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,400
We were unlucky, sir.

375
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,400
Unlucky?

376
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,865
Yeah, I would say that we were unlucky.

377
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,700
That's the kind of thing
that could start a war--

378
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,367
now how am I supposed to be able to fight

379
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:32,300
terrorists while I'm
provoking a nuclear superpower?

380
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I would advise you to calm down, sir,

381
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,800
if we're going to get through this day.

382
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,500
We didn't bring this crisis on ourselves,

383
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,200
but we're going to be the ones to settle it.

384
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,065
This is a dirty business,

385
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,500
and we're gonna have to get
our hands dirty to clean it up.

386
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,765
Now, please, Mr. President,

387
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,300
you brought me here to help you.

388
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,800
Let me do it.

389
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,900
Tony, what's the latest on Lee?

390
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,100
He's out of surgery.

391
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,400
Dr. Besson thinks he'll be able
to respond to questions soon.

392
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
All right, when that happens, I
want everyone from comm on standby.

393
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,873
Whatever information Lee gives us on the

394
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:30,800
warhead I want worked
up without any time lags.

395
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,600
We're clear about this, correct?

396
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,200
Yes, sir.

397
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:33,700
good

398
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,100
That was secretary of state Taylor.

399
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,400
He just authorized the head
of security at the Chinese

400
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:42,600
consulate to come here and
question us about the raid.

401
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:42,900
What?

402
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,500
In the middle of all this?

403
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:45,765
All right.

404
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,200
This breaks down very simply.

405
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
They want to prove that we
attacked the consulate tonight.

406
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,200
We have to make sure they can't do that.

407
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,200
Well, that ambush has
got to land on someone.

408
00:20:55,235 --> 00:20:57,000
Mike Novick's working
on that from Washington.

409
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,100
We just have to make sure all
our bases are covered here.

410
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,200
Finding that nuclear warhead
is our number one priority.

411
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,800
I'm going to go over the strategy with Jack.

412
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,452
When Cheng gets here,
send him to the situation

413
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:11,000
room, make sure all our
visible screens are masked.

414
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,800
Okay.

415
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,400
This situation with the
consulate is dragging us down.

416
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
We shouldn't be diverting resources
away from finding that warhead.

417
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,500
Hopefully this will just be a formality
and we can get rid of him quickly.

418
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,698
If we don't get information from Lee,

419
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:37,900
Audrey's husband will
have died for no reason.

420
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,400
What is she still doing here?

421
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,900
I think she wants to stay busy so
she doesn't have to think about it.

422
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,600
It's funny, when I met
Audrey this afternoon,

423
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,200
it seemed like she and
Jack were totally together.

424
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,200
A few hours later, everything's changed.

425
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,000
Michelle...

426
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,000
I hate being without you.

427
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,900
I never wanted it to be this way.

428
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,300
Cheng's here.

429
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,100
Send him to the situation room.

430
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,200
Buchanan and Jack are waiting there for him.

431
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,000
Shouldn't we keep him
more isolated than that?

432
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,500
No.

433
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,000
We have to give the impression
we have nothing to hide.

434
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,900
All right.

435
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,400
Mr. Cheng.

436
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes.

437
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,800
I'm Curtis Manning.

438
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,000
Hello, Mr. Manning.

439
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,300
Our regional director is waiting
for us in the situation room.

440
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,100
If you'll follow me...

441
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,500
good.

442
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,100
Mr. Cheng.

443
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,400
Bill Buchanan.

444
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,900
Pleasure to meet you in person.

445
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,900
My condolences for the loss of your consul.

446
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,700
Thank you.

447
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,000
This is Jack Bauer from the department
of defense, he's working for us today.

448
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,300
Mr. Cheng, please take a seat.

449
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,800
I know of Mr. Bauer, of course, from
his previous service to this country.

450
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,300
We knew you were in Los Angeles today.

451
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
When did you arrive?

452
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,800
Flew in from Washington a couple
of days ago with Secretary Heller.

453
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,100
I assume, then, secretary
Heller is still here.

454
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:32,765
No.

455
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,400
For security reasons, he's
at our district office.

456
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Why aren't you with him?

457
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,600
We felt, under the circumstances today, I
could be more helpful here at CTU with Bill.

458
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,400
That's odd.

459
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,400
Not really.

460
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,400
As you know, I used to run this office.

461
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,100
So if there's anyone capable of leading
a covert operation under short notice,

462
00:23:51,135 --> 00:23:52,433
you would be the ideal candidate.

463
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:53,684
Mr. Cheng, this kind of unfounded...

464
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,900
That's all right, Bill, I've got it.

465
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,038
Mr. Cheng, I can assure you that
neither CTU nor i had anything to

466
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:04,000
do with the terrible events that
took place at your consulate tonight.

467
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,600
I assume you know
this man-- Howard Bern.

468
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:12,100
One of your field agents.

469
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,600
This was taken by one of our
surveillance cameras tonight.

470
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,600
This photograph has been altered.

471
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Just to make it clearer.

472
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,900
Or to set up a scenario that you
can utilize for political propaganda.

473
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,900
No, Mr. Bauer.

474
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,665
We ran this image through our database.

475
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,065
The computer picked Mr.
Bern as a near perfect match.

476
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,320
Did you take the time to
cross-reference your database

477
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:37,500
to include members of the
people's freedom coalition?

478
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,320
Because according to
our information, they're

479
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:40,800
the group most likely behind this attack.

480
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,600
That would be pointless, wouldn't it?

481
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,900
This man is not asian.

482
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:44,865
Mr. Cheng,

483
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,874
you and I both know that the
PFC has initiated terrorist

484
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:50,900
activity around the globe
utilizing european mercenaries,

485
00:24:50,935 --> 00:24:54,700
half a dozen of which are a closer
match to this photograph than agent Bern.

486
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,600
I take it, then, Mr. Bern
is not available to question?

487
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,700
No, he's not here tonight.

488
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,000
Of course.

489
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,332
Mr. Cheng, you must know
that it would not be in

490
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,900
America's best interest to
provoke the Chinese government.

491
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,800
Then what are we playing these games for?

492
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,200
30 minutes before we were attacked, you
asked our consul to give up Lee Jong.

493
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,582
Before our government can comply, the

494
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,100
consulate was attacked,
Lee Jong disappeared.

495
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,000
Now you tell me you don't have Lee Jong.

496
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,600
Howard Bern is not
available to be questioned.

497
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
What are you trying to hide?

498
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,600
We're not trying to hide anything, sir.

499
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:25,100
We're just extremely busy.

500
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,000
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

501
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,100
This is Bauer.

502
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,400
We are faced with unprecedented
terrorist attacks on american soil.

503
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,800
All of our resources and attention are
focused on trying to stop those attacks.

504
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:37,400
Thank you.

505
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,100
We have confirmation on
Marwan's last location.

506
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,000
Follow up on that.

507
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,900
I'll handle the rest of
Mr. Cheng's questions.

508
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,200
I'd like to see the hourlies for Mr. Bauer.

509
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,600
I'll see what I can do.

510
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,700
O'Brian.

511
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,800
Chloe, it's Jack.

512
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,700
Have Bern meet me in the east corridor.

513
00:26:01,735 --> 00:26:02,500
Get a chopper ready now.

514
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,300
I will.

515
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,400
Meet Jack in the east corridor now.

516
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,600
Dispatch.

517
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,565
This is Chloe O'Brian

518
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Jack Bauer's requesting a helicopter
standing by for immediate departure.

519
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,400
Okay, done.

520
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,100
Thank you.

521
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,400
Come on, follow me.

522
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,300
What's going on?

523
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,000
A security camera at the Chinese
consulate picked up your face.

524
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,050
That's impossible.

525
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:26,900
I was wearing my mask.

526
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Trust me, I saw the freeze frame.

527
00:26:28,035 --> 00:26:28,600
It was you.

528
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,200
Jack, the guy ripped the mask
from my face for one second.

529
00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:32,065
I pulled it right back down.

530
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,800
I can't believe a camera picked that up.

531
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,800
I had no idea.

532
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You're going to have to leave the city.

533
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:37,200
We're working out a scenario.

534
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,400
In a couple days, you're going to have
to answer questions from the Chinese.

535
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,065
I didn't think anyone saw me.

536
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,600
That's why I didn't bring it up earlier.

537
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,100
Don't worry, we're gonna handle it.

538
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,200
I'm sorry, Jack.

539
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,265
You got to go.

540
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,500
There's a chopper waiting for you.

541
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,300
This is Bauer..

542
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,700
Jack, Lee Jong's coming out of anesthesia.

543
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,200
He should be ready for questioning now.

544
00:26:55,235 --> 00:26:56,300
Agent Rabb's already there.

545
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,900
I'm on my way.

546
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,765
Are you ready?

547
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,700
All my databases are active.

548
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,500
Okay, good.

549
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,300
Doctor, that's enough.

550
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,100
He's mine now.

551
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,800
Thank you.

552
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,000
Tell him he's in critical condition,
he still needs medical attention

553
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,265
I'm going to ask him a few questions.

554
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,100
When he answers them, I'll let
the doctor continue to treat him.

555
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,800
He understands.

556
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,000
Tell him I know that he worked
with Marwan on the warhead.

557
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,500
Now he needs to tell us where it is.

558
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,200
He doesn't know.

559
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,650
But he knows where Marwan might be.

560
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:49,900
What do you mean, where he might be?

561
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
In the van he told me he knew where he was.

562
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,500
Because of what he's doing,
Marwan's been moving around.

563
00:28:03,535 --> 00:28:04,000
Where?

564
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,700
There are three locations he
knows of that Marwan's using today.

565
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,400
What are they?

566
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,650
The Rocklyn building...

567
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:24,600
we know about that one.

568
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:25,365
A bar downtown.

569
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,500
We know about that one, too.

570
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,900
A factory on sixth.

571
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,500
Where on sixth?

572
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,500
Alameda...

573
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,100
sixth and alameda.

574
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,665
Give me an exact address.

575
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,700
That's the one we're looking for.

576
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,800
I need you to assemble a team,
make sure Curtis is on it.

577
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:45,000
They need to be ready to move now.

578
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,600
Yeah.

579
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,700
Audrey.

580
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,600
Yes?

581
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,000
The investigator from the Chinese
consulate wants to talk to you.

582
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
Why does he want to talk to me?

583
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,900
In order to protect Jack's cover,

584
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,800
we put together some new
hourlies for him to look at--

585
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,400
They show you and Jack working
together at the time of the ambush.

586
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,565
Buchanan wants me to lie to
the Chinese to protect Jack?

587
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,600
Not to protect Jack-- to protect
the united states government.

588
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Is that gonna be a problem?

589
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,200
Where are the hourlies?

590
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,900
Edgar's sending them to your system.

591
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,600
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
with this, Curtis.

592
00:29:39,635 --> 00:29:40,300
I understand.

593
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,100
Well, whatever you decide,

594
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,300
you're still gonna have to talk to Cheng.

595
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,000
What's happening?

596
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,850
Lee gave us a probable location on Marwan.

597
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:23,400
We're getting ready to move on it now.

598
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,800
I'm being called in for questioning.

599
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,700
By who?

600
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,600
Cheng, from the Chinese consulate.

601
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,300
Come here.

602
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,765
Why you?

603
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,685
Buchanan modified the
hourlies so that it'd look like

604
00:30:32,686 --> 00:30:34,500
you were working here with
me during the abduction.

605
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,300
I'm sorry, but whatever Buchanan
laid out, you got to stick to it.

606
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,700
We need to sideline Cheng now.

607
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,700
Why?

608
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,623
Now that Lee Jong's
incriminated himself, the

609
00:30:42,624 --> 00:30:44,200
Chinese government's not
gonna try to protect him.

610
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:45,400
That's not what this is about.

611
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,200
The Chinese consul was killed
during Lee's extraction.

612
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,000
The united states government
cannot be held responsible for that.

613
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,000
Jack, what are you doing?

614
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,600
You have broken every major
protocol set by CTU and the dod.

615
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:56,100
For what?

616
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,100
Is any of this working?

617
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,200
You're still alive,

618
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,800
your father's still alive,

619
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,200
and we managed to stop all but one
of the power plants from melting down.

620
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,300
Yeah, it's working.

621
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,500
We have to fight to keep it working.

622
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,100
Do what you have to, Audrey.

623
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm sorry, I've got to go.

624
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,000
Thank you.

625
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,700
Hello.

626
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,500
Mr. Buchanan, I've got Jack's
approach to Marwan's location ready.

627
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:32,900
Good.

628
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,900
Upload it to the teams; send
a copy to Tony's station.

629
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,000
He's running point on this end.

630
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,000
You got it.

631
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,000
I am surprised that after you were
kidnapped that you stayed on to work here.

632
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
That must have been very difficult for you.

633
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,965
I wasn't physically hurt,

634
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,100
and I wanted to try and help find the
people who had planned these attacks.

635
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,000
Very admirable.

636
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,532
Now, I looked through the hourlies for Mr.

637
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:57,800
Bauer, your associate from
the defense department.

638
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,165
I noticed from 1:00 A.M.

639
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,100
To 3:00 A.M, you and he were working
on some data-processing tasks.

640
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,200
Yes, that's correct.

641
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,900
And what analyst did you
give this information to?

642
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,900
Edgar Stiles.

643
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,500
Why does that matter?

644
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,100
They go through all this trouble to
reenlist a man who used to run this place--

645
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,000
Jack
Bauer--

646
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,400
and he's doing data-processing?

647
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,900
Well, it's much more subtle than it sounds.

648
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,365
There are hundreds of lists
that have to be cross-referenced,

649
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,700
and with Mr. Bauer's experience,
we were able to narrow the search.

650
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,400
I am surprised.

651
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,700
Why is that?

652
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,523
Meaning no disrespect, the log
shows that your husband,Paul

653
00:32:37,524 --> 00:32:40,400
Raines, was at the clinic
during the same hours.

654
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,700
And unfortunately, he passed away.

655
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,400
What's your point?

656
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,500
I don't believe you were
with Jack Bauer, mining data.

657
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,600
That you were waiting for your
husband while he was in surgery,

658
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,700
and that you are lying to me
now to cover for Mr. Bauer.

659
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,400
Mr. Cheng.

660
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm not going to allow you to stand
there and accuse my people of lying.

661
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,500
No.

662
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,950
And I'm not going to stand here
to endure half-baked alibis.

663
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,200
You can believe whatever you
want, but my answers stand.

664
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,200
Now, if we are done, I do
have to get back to work.

665
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,600
If you'll excuse me.

666
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:23,565
Manning.

667
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,000
President Palmer for Jack Bauer.

668
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,500
It's the White House.

669
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,200
This is Bauer.

670
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,700
Jack, this is David Palmer.

671
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,000
Mr. President.

672
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,100
CTU tells me you got something from Lee.

673
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,500
We got a location on Habib Marwan.

674
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,100
We're en route with tactical teams now.

675
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,200
We're hopeful we can
put an end to this soon.

676
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
I hope you're right, Jack.

677
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,400
This warhead can detonate any moment now.

678
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,400
We know, sir.

679
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,600
Jack...

680
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,400
tell me about the representative
from the Chinese consulate, Cheng.

681
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,300
Is he still at CTU?

682
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,800
He was there when we left.

683
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,500
Are we okay there?

684
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,200
They have a surveillance photo
of one of my team members.

685
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,700
We told them that we didn't think the photo
was clear enough to be conclusive evidence.

686
00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:01,100
That's gonna hold them off for a while.

687
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:02,700
I see.

688
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,500
Thank you, Jack.

689
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,100
Thank you, Mr. President.

690
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:06,900
And good luck.

691
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,900
Thank you, sir.

692
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,600
All right, mike.

693
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,100
I'm gonna need you to advise the
President that Cheng has to leave CTU now.

694
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,100
President Logan was clear that he
wanted Cheng to have access there.

695
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:22,800
And he has.

696
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,000
But now Cheng is slowing them down.

697
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,600
He's got to go.

698
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,900
CTU needs to be able to do their job
without the added pressure of a cover-up.

699
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,400
You think you can get President
Logan to sign off on that?

700
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,000
I'll see what I can do.

701
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,000
Yes.

702
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,265
No, not now, Keith.

703
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,200
I have too many things to deal with first.

704
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,100
Yes, you do that.

705
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,000
Thank you.

706
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,600
What is it, mike?

707
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,500
Mr. President, the Chinese
security officer, Cheng,

708
00:34:53,535 --> 00:34:56,200
is still at CTU, and he seems
to be slowing things down.

709
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,224
Well, he wouldn't be there at all if Palmer

710
00:34:58,225 --> 00:35:00,000
hadn't authorized an
attack on his consulate.

711
00:35:00,035 --> 00:35:01,500
It's too late to change that now, sir.

712
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,200
Yes.

713
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,700
Yes, it is.

714
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,465
If we order Cheng to leave CTU now,

715
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,265
it'll look like we've got something to hide,

716
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,687
and we'll just be giving the Chinese all the

717
00:35:12,688 --> 00:35:15,400
justification they need
to escalate this crisis.

718
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,500
Mr. President, if we don't find
that warhead before it's deployed,

719
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:24,100
ten million americans
could face annihilation.

720
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,600
And we could be at war
with a Billion Chinese.

721
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,400
My advice, sir, is to worry about the
americans now and the Chinese later.

722
00:35:30,435 --> 00:35:32,100
Your advice or David Palmer's advice?

723
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,000
Both of ours.

724
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,500
When I agreed to let you bring Palmer in,

725
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,800
it wasn't so the two of you
could form an alliance against me.

726
00:35:38,835 --> 00:35:40,300
Sir, that's not what's happening.

727
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:40,700
No?

728
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,100
Why don't you tell me what's happening.

729
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,280
You and David Palmer are
running this country while

730
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:46,200
I'm taking phone calls
from mid-level staffers.

731
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,500
Would you like me to ask
President Palmer to leave?

732
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,400
No.

733
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,200
Call CTU, tell Bill Buchanan to
escort Mr. Cheng out of the building.

734
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Yes, Mr. President.

735
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,600
Curtis, put Michaels in play now.

736
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,200
Chloe, this is Jack.

737
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,200
We're at the perimeter outside the factory.

738
00:36:40,235 --> 00:36:41,300
Our men are getting into position.

739
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,300
Can you confirm that Marwan's inside?

740
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,300
I can't say for sure, but I'm detecting
a microwave uplink to the building.

741
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,200
Can you intercept it?

742
00:36:47,235 --> 00:36:47,465
No.

743
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,500
It's got encryption.

744
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,400
Okay, thanks.

745
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,100
Are we ready?

746
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:54,800
Yeah.

747
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,300
How are we gonna confirm
Marwan's inside there?

748
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,000
We don'T.

749
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,900
We're out of time.

750
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,000
We move now.

751
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,000
Give all teams a go.

752
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,700
All right.

753
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,200
All teams, it's a go.

754
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,300
So you know, Mr. Buchanan,
this matter will be pursued.

755
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,100
I will return with a formal order
for a more extensive investigation.

756
00:37:15,135 --> 00:37:15,800
I understand.

757
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,800
In the meantime, if I were you, I'd focus my
attention on the people's freedom coalition.

758
00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:21,800
I'm quite sure they are your perpetrators.

759
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,700
We'll do everything we can to help you.

760
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,400
Sir.

761
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,700
Excuse me.

762
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,400
Jack's team is at the staging
area outside the building.

763
00:37:30,435 --> 00:37:31,200
I'll be right there.

764
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,400
Mr. Cheng, excuse me, please.

765
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,500
I have to get back.

766
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,600
My men will escort you from the building.

767
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,500
Thank you.

768
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,100
Edgar.

769
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,200
Excuse me.

770
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,100
Edgar Stiles, communication analyst, right?

771
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah. I'm busy.

772
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,000
I forgot to ask Mr. Buchanan one last thing.

773
00:37:53,035 --> 00:37:54,100
Maybe you could help me.

774
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,950
I can't help you.

775
00:37:54,985 --> 00:37:55,892
You should ask him.

776
00:37:55,927 --> 00:37:56,800
It's not classified.

777
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,024
Audrey Raines had mentioned to me that you

778
00:37:59,025 --> 00:38:01,400
were helping her earlier
with some DOD files.

779
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,500
Yeah, until she was
called down to the clinic.

780
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,000
So it was just you and Jack?

781
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,200
What?

782
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,300
Edgar, come here.

783
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,000
I have to go.

784
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:10,400
Bye.

785
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:11,600
Thank you.

786
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,200
You idiot.

787
00:38:14,235 --> 00:38:14,465
What?

788
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Just keep your mouth shut.

789
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:16,500
I didn't say anything.

790
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,100
[Mandarin]

791
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,600
The man who led the attack on
our consulate was Jack Bauer.

792
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,100
Pull up all his files.

793
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,900
I want to look at them when I get back.

794
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,400
[Mandarin]

795
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,900
Michael, are you in position?

796
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,800
Roger that.

797
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,000
He's at your two
o'clock-- take him out.

798
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:38,600
Copy that.

799
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,200
We're ready.

800
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,500
Start the sequence.

801
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,400
We're done here.

802
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,700
Get the car.

803
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
He's cornered in this room.

804
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,000
Counter-flank and push him back to me.

805
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,600
Copy that.

806
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,400
Freeze.

807
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,900
I've been waiting for this.

808
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,700
You're too late.

809
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,500
That hurts, doesn't it?

810
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:51,900
Jack.

811
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,600
Jack, what are you doing?

812
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,100
We still need him.

813
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,500
Go ahead,

814
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,400
kill me.

815
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,900
That won't stop the missile.

816
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
What are you talking about?

817
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,300
What are you talking about!

818
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,000
Jack, we got a problem.

819
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,900
Come here a second and look at this.

820
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,300
Secure the prisoner.

821
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,200
Oh, my god, they've got a missile.

822
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,700
Have you got your comm unit?

823
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,200
Patch it through to the computer.

824
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,800
Tony, it's Jack. Can you hear me?

825
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,465
Yeah, Jack.

826
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,200
What's going on?

827
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,800
I'm looking at a live feed of the warhead.

828
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:50,100
It's been mounted on a missile.

829
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:50,900
A missile?

830
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:51,900
How can that be?

831
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,265
I don't know.

832
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,500
We're trying to get the
feed over to you now.

833
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:54,100
Hold on.

834
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,300
Have you got it?

835
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,065
Yeah.

836
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,900
How much time have we got?

837
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,300
52 seconds.

838
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,400
Tony, can you see this?

839
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,400
Yeah.

840
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,200
Can you get a source of the transmission?

841
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,100
Hang on a second.

842
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,000
No, Jack-- it's on
an encrypted uplink.

843
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,065
There's no way to trace it.

844
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,500
Do a geography scan-- see
if you can pull a location.

845
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,100
Chloe, are there any identifying
specifics on the visual?

846
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,900
Looks like a forest
area, trees, a structure.

847
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,500
Tony, we're out of time.

848
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,200
We're trYing, Jack, but we can't I.D.

849
00:42:32,235 --> 00:42:33,300
The location--
it's too general.

850
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,900
See if you can pick up a heat
signature from the point of Ignition.

851
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,400
We'll try it, but it's a wide radius.

852
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,000
There're not gonna be enough
time to stop it launched.

853
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,700
Chloe, do you have anything.

854
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,700
I'm trying the four band satellite,
but it's not working, either.

855
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:48,701
