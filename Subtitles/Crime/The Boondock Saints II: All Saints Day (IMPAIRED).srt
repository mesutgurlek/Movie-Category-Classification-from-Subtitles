The killer posed

Once the victim

though, didn't it?

301
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,449
Maybe we should dye it.

302
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,112
What?

303
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,785
Well, they're always
dying their hair
in the movies,

304
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,755
like <i>The Fugitive.</i>

305
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,826
It's covert and shit.

306
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,891
What color
would you dye it?

307
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,227
Lighter, I guess.

308
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,668
(LAUGHING)
Do you mean blonde?

309
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,295
I didn't
fucking say that.

310
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,271
Like California
surfer boy.

311
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,364
It's not
what I'm saying.

312
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,943
Like gay, gay, gay,

313

I'm fucking warning you!

"Stay gold, Ponyboy!"
I'm fucking warning you!

00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,311
"Stay gold<i>..."</i>
Fuck you!

00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,315
What kind of
fucking crazy...

320
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,553
I know who you are.
You guys are...

321
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:04,856
Shut it!

322
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,488
This is so
fucking cool, man!

323
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,466
I'm from Boston and
I love you guys. Shit,
everybody loves you guys.

324
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,595
Maybe I can get on this thing.
You know, bring some

Hey, is it true that
you guys say a prayer
before you grease somebody?

326

(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

327
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,854
And an awesome wailing
was heard
throughout heaven.

328
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,289
And the terrible
hand of the Lord
struck upon the Earth.

329
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:39,296
And as Almighty God
created you,

330
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,533
now he calleth
you home!

he took a little piss.

That shit was not funny!

338
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,056

me fucking nose.

I've got connects

No.

Why not?

347
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,349
We don't have to
give you fucking reasons.
Forget it.

348

It's because
I'm Mexican,
isn't it?

349
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,888
How dare you, sir,
insinuate such a thing?

350
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,356
The fact that
you're a greasy spic,

351
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,223
it's got nothing
to do with it.

352
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,286
Okay, I'm gonna
let you have that one,
but, look, I can do this.

353
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,023
This isn't
rocket surgery.

354

You guys find the bad guys
doing bad stuff
and you kill them, right?

00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,238
Well, it's not
that simple, actually.

356
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,465
Yes, it is.

357
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,905
Suppose you're right.

358
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:02,077
I was just hoping that
we was a bit more artistic
about it, I think.

Yeah? Well, you ain't.

360
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,648
Now, what do you plan
on doing when you get
to US soil?

361
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:15,821
We don't really have,
you know, a succinct
plan yet, you know, per se.

362
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:19,422
Haven't really
worked it all out,
as it were.

As it were.
Not fully developed,
per se.

364

You two leprechaun dicks

And we're talking riot gear
at Celtics games here.

Now, I can clear them
of this murder

and take the piss
right out of this thing.

be going any worse.

throw us in the Hoag.

lunch and dinner!

Now, I understand
you've got
a job to do, Chief.

395

But this pint-sized killer
is the only thing

in the middle of this.

even sniffs
that we on to him,

in Napoleon's head,

plants him at the bottom
of the ocean and walks.

that we find

in your days, but that...

and start doing

are gonna turn up.

of knowing that

totally happen.

words with "spic"
right in the middle.

know style if it pitched
a tent in your ass.

we go to Doc's
for a shot of Irish,

Well, it's just
this plan...

with the plan?

I can even drive
an f-lift, man.

Got my Class D license
and everything.

That's the
fucking spirit!

00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,520
I'm gonna need a gun.

446

00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:25,292
What the fuck, man?
I'm in on this shit.
I'm working here!

448
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,324
Okay.

449
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,060
For fuck's sake!

you're gonna do.

00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,217
Gentlemen.

911
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:13,386
All right.
The gang's all here.

912
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:18,185
Give me my fucking BB gun.

913
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,625
No, Rome.
You've earned
your stripes.

914
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:30,129
Hey, tighten it up.

915
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:35,968
So?

916
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,645
Where's Gorgeous?

917

MAN 1 : ls that George?

(MAN 2 READING)

919
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,065
What the fuck is that?

920
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,793
It's Irish for,
"You're fucked."

921
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:05,733
<i>Que viva México,</i> bitches!

(WHOOPING)

923
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:41,135
I've seen the light!

924
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,075
You guys have
really turned me
around on this.

925
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:45,272
I'm, like,
born again and shit!

926
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,212
Should we let him go?

(PANTING)

928
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:53,148
You know what
I think we should do?

929
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,555
I think we should
let God decide if he
gets a second chance.

930
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,524
What the fuck
you doing?

931
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:01,061
What the...
No, man, come on.

932
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,165
Hey, what the fuck
you gonna do?

933
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,805
You had best be right
with your Jesus, boy.

GEORGE: Yeah?

940
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:35,255
You know
all good boys
go to heaven.

941
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:41,699
You know, that was perhaps
one of the finest examples
of spiritual guidance

942
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,396
I've ever had
the good fortune
to witness.

943
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:45,064
It was wonderful,
wasn't it?

CONNOR: Mysterious ways,
I tell you, mysterious ways.

one of your fucking plans...
