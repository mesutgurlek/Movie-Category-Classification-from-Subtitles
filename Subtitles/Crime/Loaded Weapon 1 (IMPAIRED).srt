If I push her any harder, she'll blow!

156
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,080
Give me my plate!

157
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:40,534
<i>I don't think York was a suicide.
She was onto something.</i>

158
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:45,620
<i>On something is more like it!
Those cookies were laced with cocaine!</i>

159
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:48,333
No wonder I couldn't eat just one.

160
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:58,002
York left me a message. She'd uncovered
drug runners. That's what got her killed.

161
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,595
- You don't think it was bullets?
- Give me the case.

162
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,252
You're days from retirement. Let it go.

163
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:09,174
<i>Let it go?!
York was a partner. A friend. I owe her!</i>

164
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:15,138
I owe it to every cop who's ever walked
a beat and laid his life on the line!

165
00:16:15,313 --> 00:16:18,811
Wait a minute! I'm the captain here!
I do all the yelling!

166
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,811
- If it's that important, take the case!
- Thank you!

167
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,520
- Thank you, Captain.
- Don't be so fast to thank me!

168
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:31,562
You gonna be naked on this one! It's on
the line! You blow it, you're goir down!

169
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:36,030
You gonna be hung out to dry! Drop the
ball and you'll be twistir in the wind!

170
00:16:36,116 --> 00:16:39,982
Embarrass this department,
and your pants will be dancing with figs!

171
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:43,741
- Is that clear?!
- Everything but the pants-fig thing.

172
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:50,161
Narco's sending one of their burned-out
psychos to look into the cookies!

173
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:54,744
- I'm teamir him with you!
- Captain, you know I work alone.

174
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:57,159
You get the case, you get Jack Colt!

175
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,499
Cigarette!

176
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,624
- Cigarette! Hit the floor!
- Cancer stick!

177
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:11,592
- Hey! Back off!
- Easy.

178
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,918
That's Luger's new partner!

179
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:17,510
You can't seriously be thinking
of using this man.

180
00:17:17,597 --> 00:17:19,636
He's dangerous! A menace!

181
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,057
A loose cannon. A walking time bomb.

182
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:26,186
Most of all, he is gun-happy.

183
00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:30,185
(cocks pistol)
Where do you get off sayir that?

184
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:37,562
I give up.

185
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:41,148
There's someone you better talk to
if this case involves cookies.

186
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:44,438
- Not him.
- Yeah. Him!

Do not touch the glass.

189
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,530
Do not hand him any sharp instruments,
power tools, sewing items or condiments.

190
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:13,416

Aaaaah!

209

Please. Sit.

211

Dr Leacher, we need to ask you...

212
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:52,465
There's someone out there again,
isrt there?

213
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,262
- A bad boy with pastries.
- Yes!

214
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:58,436

215
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:02,519

You wear that sometimes, don't you?

216
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:07,644
(sniffing) But not today.
Today, it's... mentholated Deep Heat rub.

217
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:12,437
You order chef's salad
with dressing on the side.

218
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:14,767
You have a wife with perky breasts...

219
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:17,352
<i>...a nine-year-old son
and a sixteen-year-old daughter.</i>

220

- Who told you that?
- I saw their picture in your wallet.

221
00:20:21,366 --> 00:20:23,819
We came here to talk about cookies.

222
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,822
Quid pro quo, Mr Colt.

223
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,033
What's that mean?

224
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,157
It means I'm pretentious.

225
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:37,872
Tell me about the worst meal
you've ever eaten, Mr Colt. Quick!

226
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:40,365
Uh... it was a fish sandwich at, um...

227
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,950
Don't tell him anything!
Now, can you help us?

228
00:20:43,294 --> 00:20:45,914
You hold the key, Mr Colt.

229
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:51,084
Look into yourself
for an answer to the cookie concern.

230
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:54,174
Look to a man
with whom you were involved.

231
00:20:57,385 --> 00:20:59,258
(gulls cry)

232
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:02,759
No, no. Not him. It was in Vietnam.

233
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:06,220
(wind moans)

234
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,590
(gulls cry)

235
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,767
No, no. You disappoint me, Mr Colt.

236
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,051
It was Mortars. General Mortars.

237
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:21,189
- Wait a minute! I never...
- I didrt mean that kind of involvement.

238
00:21:21,274 --> 00:21:24,641
- Oh.
- You were under his command.

239
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:26,774
Mortars was my patient.

240
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:30,061
- I taught him to express his anger.
- You taught him well.

241
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:35,361
Quite. After our last session,
he started the Vietnamese war.

242
00:21:35,656 --> 00:21:39,238
Seek him out.
And... when you find him...

243
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:41,446
<i>...please...</i>

244
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:44,155
<i>...I would love to eat his cookies...</i>

245
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:47,446
<i>...with some fava beans
and a nice chilled Fresca.</i>

246
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,530
(slurps)

247
00:21:56,377 --> 00:21:59,874
I just gotta ask.
What does human flesh taste like?

248
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,709
Chicken.

249
00:22:02,797 --> 00:22:04,835
Are we gonna see Mortars?

250
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:09,049
Follow the lead of a mind-twisting,
jumpsuit-wearing sociopath?

251
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:11,712
Forget it. I've only got 48 hours.

252
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:14,718
Wrong, Sarge. 47 hours, 29 minutes.

253
00:22:16,555 --> 00:22:19,921
- I'm looking for my ex-partner's killer.
- Come on, Spud! This way!

254
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:23,216
She was meeting some stoolie
at the Squealer's Hotel.

255
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:25,844
- I'm innocent!
- I don't need a hotshot cowboy...

256
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:28,056
- They're gonna fry me!
- Not validated.

257
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:32,436
- What?
- Va... li... da... ted.

258
00:22:33,188 --> 00:22:38,181
What I don't need is a hotshot cowboy
from Narco gettir in my way. You got it?

259
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,061
Listen, pal, you're not the only one
who lost a partner. I...

260
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,186
- You got anything smaller?
- Keep it.

261
00:22:44,737 --> 00:22:47,061
- Anything larger?
- Yeah.

262
00:22:53,116 --> 00:22:55,689
Claire and I rode together
for seven years.

263
00:22:55,784 --> 00:23:00,029
York and I were in Academy together.
Then we partnered for five years.

264
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,361
Before that,
we dodged the draft together.

265
00:23:02,454 --> 00:23:05,489
Before that, we played
high-school football together.

266
00:23:05,582 --> 00:23:08,948
Before that,
we were in grade school together.

267
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:12,076
And before that, we breast-fed together.

268
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:15,541
What happened to your partner?

269
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:18,034
I don't know.
I came home and she was gone.

270
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,039
You were living together?

271
00:23:20,131 --> 00:23:23,582
Hell, she'd sleep at my feet
and lick my toes.

272
00:23:23,675 --> 00:23:26,627
Though sometimes
she'd just lick herself for hours.

273
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:32,335
Huh. I don't think it's such a good idea
to get that involved with your partner.

274
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,920
<i>Hey, you try not getting involved...</i>

275
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:39,093
<i>...with a partner who saves your life,
then nuzzles your crotch.</i>

276
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,388
Billy and I didrt have
that kind of relationship.

277
00:23:42,102 --> 00:23:46,512
She left the force about five years ago.
We didrt see each other much after...

278
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:48,810
<i>...but when we did,
she was excited to see me.</i>

279
00:23:48,897 --> 00:23:51,019
When Claire was excited,
she'd pee on my leg.

280
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:55,849
- What do you think happened to her?
- Maybe she just took off.

281
00:23:55,942 --> 00:24:01,647
I didrt pay enough attention to her.
I realised when she shit in my shoes.

282
00:24:03,238 --> 00:24:06,605
But my gut tells me
we were getting too close to someone.

283
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:08,856
I had a feeling we were being followed.

284
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,656
You may be right.
I think we're being followed now.

285
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,905
Don't look! Just play it cool.

286
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:20,989
So, uh... did you catch that
Stallone retrospective?

287
00:24:21,082 --> 00:24:23,749
<i>No! Sounds fascinating, though.</i>

288
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,871
I'm gonna try and lose 'em.

289

290
00:24:31,963 --> 00:24:34,452

General.

306
00:25:29,454 --> 00:25:32,156
(camp) How's your health, Mike?

307
00:25:32,245 --> 00:25:34,035
Fine.

308
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:37,953
(water bubbles, TV announcer chatters)

309
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,747
- Sea-Monkeys?
- Pirana.

310
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:47,203
Their lives exude
a beautiful simplicity:

311
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:51,837
<i>...savage, ruthless,
existing only to devour and destroy...</i>

312
00:25:51,923 --> 00:25:54,674
<i>...to taste blood, to rend flesh.</i>

313
00:25:55,342 --> 00:25:57,833
Sounds like me, right? (chuckles)

314
00:25:58,594 --> 00:26:01,592
(bubbling and gurgling)

315
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:08,303
(chuckles evilly)

316
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:17,012
In its own environment, the pirana is
a killer. In mine, just a helpless fish.

317
00:26:17,105 --> 00:26:20,471
There's a lesson to be learned from that,
don't you think?

318
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,519
Mike...

319
00:26:24,941 --> 00:26:28,889
<i>- (hair dryer whirs)
- ...I have a concern you might alleviate.</i>

320
00:26:29,568 --> 00:26:34,643
(turns dryer off) Certain information
was shared with an individual...

321
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:39,648
<i>...who might have jeopardised the cookie
operation. While they were eliminated...</i>

322
00:26:41,158 --> 00:26:45,321
<i>...we have yet to recover
a very important item.</i>

323
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,735
Where is the microfilm, Mike?

324
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:52,612
I don't know. I gave it to York.
I thought she was one of your men.

325
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:57,410
- Act in haste, repent in leisure.
- But he who hesitates is lost.

326
00:26:57,501 --> 00:27:00,252
- Never judge a book by its cover.
- What you see is what you get.

327
00:27:00,336 --> 00:27:03,501
- Loose lips sink ships.
- Life is very short...

328
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:07,750
<i>...and there's no time
for fussing and fighting, my friend.</i>

329
00:27:13,468 --> 00:27:15,958
Sorry, Mike, no good.

330
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:19,213
You've been careless. Sloppy.

331
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,468
We just can't have that.

332
00:27:23,223 --> 00:27:25,844
Where's the microfilm, Mike?

333
00:27:29,643 --> 00:27:33,426
(snivels) Please... I don't have it...

334
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:37,850
(pistol shots, women scream,
automatic weapons fire)

335
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:43,018
(tyres screech)

336
00:27:58,701 --> 00:28:01,700
Does this have anything to do with
the Billy York killing?

337
00:28:01,787 --> 00:28:04,028
Nah. Domestic dispute.

338
00:28:05,372 --> 00:28:07,992
OK, I'm gonna try and talk 'em out.

339
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:11,247
Hold your fire untiI I give the order!

340
00:28:13,336 --> 00:28:16,784
Anata wa kira desu!
Watashi wa Sergeant Luger desu!

341
00:28:19,588 --> 00:28:23,419
Can I have one that's made in America?
You up there!

342
00:28:23,507 --> 00:28:28,748
I order you to throw your hands down
and come out with your weapons up!

343
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:38,221
- (gunshot)
- Who fired that shot?

344
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:42,589
- Sergeant. That was me.
- Give it to me.

345
00:28:42,685 --> 00:28:46,134
- Well, you see, I was just...
- Glve me the gun!

346
00:28:46,228 --> 00:28:49,477
When you learn to follow orders,
you can have it back.

347
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,766
Oh, so we think that's funny,
do we, Officer... Davis(?)

348
00:28:56,858 --> 00:29:00,392
<i>Well, maybe we'd a//
like to know what's so funny!</i>

349
00:29:00,486 --> 00:29:04,185
<i>Maybe Officer Davis
can make us a// laugh.</i>

350
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,359
Nice to see
all those smiling faces out there!

351
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:14,236
Say, what do you call 2,000 lawyers
at the bottom of the sea?

352
00:29:14,326 --> 00:29:17,990
<i>- A good start! (guffaws)
- (drum ro// and cymba/)</i>

353
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,118
Why'd the guy name his penis?

354
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:24,200
He didrt want a stranger
making most of his decisions!

355
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:26,413
Thanks a lot. You've been great.

356
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:30,293
Make sure he doesn't get any doughnuts.

357
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:37,838
You could've gone lighter on the guys.

358
00:29:37,922 --> 00:29:42,085
That's how it starts.
You lighten up, next thing you know...

359
00:29:42,175 --> 00:29:44,546
<i>...all the rules are out the window.</i>

360
00:29:44,634 --> 00:29:46,673
- Tight-ass.
- You say something?

361
00:29:46,762 --> 00:29:48,801
Uh-uh.

362
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,759
Pencil-neck.

363
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,429
Butthead.

364
00:29:58,977 --> 00:30:01,300
(man coughs)

365
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:03,891
What is it with you guys?

366
00:30:03,978 --> 00:30:07,346
I run a respectable place!
What are you arrestir me for?

367
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:11,305
I got friends downtown.
I don't know what you're talkir about!

368
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:14,435
- We haven't said anything yet.
- I got nothir to say!

369
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:19,400
Park the tongue, buddy! I'm Sergeant
Colt. This is Sergeant Luger.

370
00:30:19,487 --> 00:30:22,108
Did you know a woman named Billy York?

371
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:23,572
You got a picture?

372
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,489
Here we go.

373
00:30:35,163 --> 00:30:38,779
- That her?
- No, that's her picture.

374
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:41,405
Nope, don't know her.

375
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,081
<i>Well, maybe this
will refresh your memory.</i>

376
00:30:49,421 --> 00:30:51,626
She's a little out of focus.

377
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:54,250
(woman screams, gunshot)

378
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,297
(shriek)

379
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:04,218
(bullets ricochet, screeching)

380
00:31:04,512 --> 00:31:06,719
(woman shrieks)

381
00:31:08,182 --> 00:31:11,678
Is this the Billy York informant
shoot-out?

382
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:14,173
I don't know, I just got here.
Wait a second.

383
00:31:14,727 --> 00:31:17,264
Hey, Larry! Larry!

384
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:21,928
Is this the Billy York informant
shoot-out?

385
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:25,517
- Nah. Check out the third floor.
- Thanks.

386
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,568
Beat it.

387
00:31:37,906 --> 00:31:40,193
This is an FBI case.

388
00:31:40,449 --> 00:31:43,069
All right, bring him on out.

389
00:31:47,578 --> 00:31:49,819
Is he the York informant?

390
00:31:49,912 --> 00:31:53,197
Get your shit together, will ya?
That's Becker, 403.

391
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,039
Hey, you!

392
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:04,917
Not so fast.

393
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,169
That's better!

394
00:32:10,675 --> 00:32:12,712
No! I'll handle this.

395
00:32:13,383 --> 00:32:15,422
All right, Becker, open up! Police!

396
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:17,632
(machine-gun fire)

397
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:20,176
(firing stops)

398
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:26,093
Now that we've tried it your way,
let's try mine.

399
00:32:28,808 --> 00:32:32,425
- Who is it?
- Rrrrroom service!

400
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:39,803
Whadda-whadda what? I don't know
nothir! I airt sayir nothir!

401
00:32:40,065 --> 00:32:45,305
<i>Nothing! The word is nothing,
not nothir. It has an "ing" on the end.</i>

402
00:32:45,402 --> 00:32:48,732
OK. Nothing. No... thing.

403
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,571
Nothiiiiiiiiiiing!

404
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:54,027
- OK? You happy(?)
- That's better.

405
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:59,617
- That's not what you told York.
- I don't know no York. Where's my food?

406
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:02,108
We ate it.
And please, no double negatives.

407
00:33:02,203 --> 00:33:04,775
<i>Sorry(!) I don't know any York.</i>

408
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:09,620
<i>You don't know any York?
These matches say you're lying.</i>

409
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:13,581
Oh! Oh, York.

410
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:16,701
She was supposed to meet you
the night she died. Why?

411
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,628
- It's where I live.
- Yeah, but why you?

412
00:33:19,712 --> 00:33:22,498
The other guy
couldn't come up with the deposit.

413
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:27,414
- What do you know about microfilm?
- It's small, and, uh... brittle...

414
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:31,422
<i>- ...and it's used in a lot of Bond films.
- (buzzer)</i>

415
00:33:38,264 --> 00:33:42,592
All right! I did money laundering for
your standard ex-military psycho types.

416
00:33:42,683 --> 00:33:45,717
- Give me a name.
- Arert your parents supposed to do it?

417
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,182
- Who are you working with?
- I can't say!

418
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:52,396
- There's been three attempts on my life!
- Come with us, and there won't be more.

419
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,689
All right, but you gotta understand,
this thing is bigger than Watergate!

420
00:33:56,774 --> 00:34:01,730
It's bigger than Oprah! There's nothing
you can do cos they're too powerful!

421
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:04,902
And they're too... je ne sais quoi.

422
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:07,607
We can protect you.

423
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:10,152
(glass tinkles)

424
00:34:10,532 --> 00:34:13,864
La commedia... è fini...

425
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:19,987
Guess that's the last time
he'll trust a cop.

426
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,493
<i>- (# Puccini: Nessun Dorma)
- Give it to me straight. Is this it?</i>

427
00:34:23,581 --> 00:34:26,035
Level with me. How bad is it?

428
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:31,372
<i>It's not bad. You'll be fine.
You'll be back on your feet in no time.</i>

429
00:34:52,096 --> 00:34:55,962
- Your ticket.
- Don't bury me, I'll only be a minute.

430
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:07,138
OK, you two. Just a little closer
together. OK, big smile.

431
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,763
(photographer) Beautiful.

432
00:35:09,856 --> 00:35:13,555
They bought it right away.
Those two tried to make a getaway.

433
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:19,600
- They gave me a new partner, too.
- (barks and yelps)

434
00:35:19,862 --> 00:35:21,900
This is Sport.

435
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:24,275
- She likes you.
- I've done worse.

436
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:31,280
- What are we looking at here?
- Mixed breed.

437
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:35,150
Rottweiler and Chihuahua.
I guess they used a lubricant.

438
00:35:35,245 --> 00:35:37,072
- I'm talking about the case.
- Oh.

439
00:35:37,163 --> 00:35:39,368
Seeing Sport, I think I could love again.

440
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,165
(both growl)

441
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:47,665
- What do you have, Irv?
- Oh, I'm not sure, Sarge.

442
00:35:47,753 --> 00:35:50,621
It's a nagging, itching,
burning sensation.

443
00:35:50,712 --> 00:35:54,210
What the hell do you expect?
Your foot's on fire.

444
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:01,588
- (splosh)
- What you got, Sarge?

445
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:04,427
Well... nothing solid.

446
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:08,925
- You got any theories?
- E equals mc squared.

447
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:11,634
Anything of your own?

448
00:36:11,722 --> 00:36:15,850
No. I'll tell you, Sarge,
something just doesn't add up.

449
00:36:15,935 --> 00:36:17,973
- What?
- (Colt) Get her off me!

450
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:22,436
My wife and I haven't had sex for two
years. I have a six-month-old daughter.

451
00:36:22,522 --> 00:36:26,019
(chuckles)
Irv, Irv, you're getting too suspicious.

452
00:36:26,107 --> 00:36:28,562
This job will do that to you.

453
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,649
You're right, Sarge. Thanks.

454
00:36:31,735 --> 00:36:34,652
- (photographer) OK, smile.
- How's this?

455
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:40,022
<i>All right. Stay just as you are.</i>

456
00:36:55,957 --> 00:37:00,616
- Goodness!
- Hey, buddy, want to give me a hand?

457
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:04,667
<i>I don't know,
this may /ook like a suicide...</i>

458
00:37:04,753 --> 00:37:08,665
<i>...but my gut tells me
there's something else going on.</i>

459
00:37:08,755 --> 00:37:11,672
- (water bubbles, man screams)
- Hey, uh...

460
00:37:11,757 --> 00:37:14,673
<i>...werert there five stiffs?
Damn! McCrackers missing!</i>

461
00:37:15,134 --> 00:37:18,466
- Hey! Anyone seen McCrackers body?
- (Colt) Thanks, Lefty.

462
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:21,635
I need a little help here!
He didrt just get up and walk away!

463
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,839
- What?
- I got something important to show you.

464
00:37:26,682 --> 00:37:29,219
So... what's the big news?

465
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:36,103
See this? This ring was given out to a
CIA front in 'Nam run by General Mortars.

466
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,637
When the VC tried financing the war
with cocaine, they burned it.

467
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:44,806
Twelve years later, Mortars and his men
went into the drug business.

468
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,690
- Ticket?
- I could never prove it.

469
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:51,851
Are you saying you took evidence from
the scene of a criminal investigation?

470
00:37:51,946 --> 00:37:55,693
- Do you want to crack this case?
- Not by making up the rules as I go!

471
00:37:55,782 --> 00:38:00,571
Sometimes, pal,
those are the only rules that work!

472
00:38:02,661 --> 00:38:05,659
- Good thing we use valet parking.
- Taxi!

473
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:11,373
Guess we're making somebody nervous.

474
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:15,404
It's gonna take more than
a couple of car bombs to stop us.

475
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,121
Not a hell of a lot more.

476
00:38:21,171 --> 00:38:25,248
Don't worry about all this bomb stuff.
It happens to me all the time.

477
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:29,880
I'm not. I'm trying to figure out
what to tell my wife about her car.

478
00:38:29,966 --> 00:38:32,717
(growls)

479
00:38:37,971 --> 00:38:42,299
Understand, gentlemen,
if you wish to do business with us...

480
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:46,338
<i>- ...you must take the entire shipment.
- Test the merchandise.</i>

481
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:52,977
Half the payment now, half tomorrow...

482
00:38:53,146 --> 00:38:56,146
<i>...half on delivery.
The price is not negotiable.</i>

483
00:38:56,231 --> 00:39:00,274
- The merchandise is satisfactory, yes?
- (hissing)

484
00:39:02,026 --> 00:39:04,313
Good. Then we can do business.

485
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:08,860
Use the Vista card.
You get frequent flyer miles.

486
00:39:09,364 --> 00:39:14,782
The shipment will be prepared and boxed
Friday evening, for shipping Saturday.

487
00:39:15,241 --> 00:39:19,155
<i>I need a signature
and daytime pheune number.</i>

488
00:39:20,203 --> 00:39:22,871
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

489
00:39:22,954 --> 00:39:24,862
Not so fast.

490
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:30,906
- The carbons?
- Smart man.

491
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:36,079
I like doing business with smart men.

492
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:40,417
They know never to screw with me.

493
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:49,588
There's something between you
and this General Mortars.

494
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:51,917
He was my CO in 'Nam.

495
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:54,882
The CIA listed him as MIA,
but the VA ID'd his MO...

496
00:39:54,972 --> 00:39:56,798
<i>- ...and we put out an APB.
- Oh, I see.</i>

497
00:40:01,184 --> 00:40:05,310
- May I help you?
- It can't be! Not Mary O'Brien...

498
00:40:05,394 --> 00:40:10,267
<i>...the buck-toothed, freckle-faced,
pigtailed girl I knew in fifth grade?</i>

499
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:13,261
No, I'm not. May I help you?

500
00:40:13,983 --> 00:40:19,271
I'm Sergeant Luger. Sergeant Colt.
These are our wallets.

501
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:22,313
- (man) Ow!
- May we speak to whomever's in charge?

502
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:24,194
Follow me.

503
00:40:35,827 --> 00:40:38,282
(metallic clink, man groans)

504
00:40:40,706 --> 00:40:45,864
Miss Demeanor will be right with you.
Help yourself to some cookies.

505
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:55,002
Let me do the talking.
I've eaten their cookies.

506
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:56,368
You're the boss.

507
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:03,337
Detectives Colt and Loser?

508
00:41:03,426 --> 00:41:07,505
- Lu-ger.
- Oh, sorry. Loogie.

509
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:14,839
Hm... Why don't you make yourselves
at home?

510
00:41:22,228 --> 00:41:27,185
No, I meant why don't you sit down
and tell me what you want?

511
00:41:27,856 --> 00:41:31,900
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Uh... just water.

512
00:41:31,984 --> 00:41:33,393
No, thanks.

513
00:41:35,028 --> 00:41:38,940
We are investigating a felony,
Miss Demeanor.

514
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:42,528
Oh, it sounds violent... I hate violence!

515
00:41:43,824 --> 00:41:47,950
(savage cries)

516
00:41:48,035 --> 00:41:50,821
(stabbing speeds up)

517
00:41:52,537 --> 00:41:55,324
- Anyone for snow cones?
- Thanks!

518
00:42:04,044 --> 00:42:07,706
During the course of investigating
two homicides...

519
00:42:07,836 --> 00:42:12,747
<i>...we found boxes of Wilderness Girl
cookies. They were laced with cocaine.</i>

520
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,006
Oh, my! That's horrible!

521
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:20,752
But you can't suspect the Wilderness
Girls of somehow being responsible?

522
00:42:21,053 --> 00:42:26,008
I can. I'd like you to come downtown
and answer a few questions.

523
00:42:26,222 --> 00:42:28,260
OK.

524
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:32,595
<i>- This is downtown.
- Headquarters.</i>

525
00:42:32,685 --> 00:42:37,971
- You can have your attorney present.
- Why would I need my attorney?

526
00:42:43,274 --> 00:42:44,766
(kissing)

527
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,896
(steam hisses)

528
00:42:57,322 --> 00:43:00,655
- May I change before I go?
- Sure.

529
00:43:10,665 --> 00:43:15,288
- You should always wear your hair down.
- For you, I always will.

530
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:21,912
Look, lady, you may think you can
divert our attention. But you're wrong.

531
00:43:22,337 --> 00:43:25,999
We see through your tricks.
Now move it.

532
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:31,425
Do you run the Wilderness Girls?

533
00:43:33,301 --> 00:43:34,710
Yes.

534
00:43:34,802 --> 00:43:38,418
- Is your money raised selling cookies?
- Yes.

535
00:43:38,512 --> 00:43:41,843
- Do you know General Mortars?
- Well, I drive a Buick.

536
00:43:41,931 --> 00:43:45,344
No, that's General Mortars. Mor... tars.

537
00:43:49,518 --> 00:43:53,430
(rustling, all suck in breath)

538
00:43:55,773 --> 00:43:58,772
- No.
- And that's one down, nine to go.

539
00:43:58,857 --> 00:44:02,768
Hi, how you doir? Don't mind me.
Just keep doir what you're doir.

540
00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:07,815
We're a team. Hey, honey! Nice outfit.
Points out all the tourist attractions!

541
00:44:07,903 --> 00:44:10,572
- Didrt you die?
- I thought this was a sequel.

542
00:44:10,655 --> 00:44:13,441
Miss Demeanor,
this would not be a good time to lie.

543
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:17,610
- When is(?)
- I don't know the meaning of the word.

544
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,032
- Who was the last man to bat over 400?
- Ted Williams.

545
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:24,486
- What did Cher see in Sonny?
- Did Oswald act alone?

546
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,578
- Need help shaving your legs?
- Show a little respect!

547
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:31,660
- So, how many men have you slept with?
- (men inale sharply)

548
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,419
(excited murmuring)

549
00:44:38,963 --> 00:44:41,712
(men groan disgustedly)

550
00:44:42,506 --> 00:44:46,372
- Five. Maybe six.
- Not a lot for this day and age.

551
00:44:46,757 --> 00:44:48,999
It's been a slow week.

552
00:44:49,092 --> 00:44:53,966
- Do you know Bill York?
- Who cares? Do you sleep in the nude?

553
00:44:54,055 --> 00:44:57,836
- Only when I'm naked.
- How do you feel about the...

554
00:44:57,932 --> 00:45:01,345
<i>- ...designated-hitter rule?
- I hate it.</i>

555
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:04,218
It undermines the purity of the game.

556
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,974
I like pure things.

557
00:45:09,437 --> 00:45:12,105
(sizzling)

558
00:45:15,316 --> 00:45:16,809
(Miss Demeanor exhales)

559
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,438
They give me pleasure.

560
00:45:19,527 --> 00:45:21,600
Here we go. God...

561
00:45:21,693 --> 00:45:25,026
(excited whispering)

562
00:45:25,112 --> 00:45:26,690
Yes!

563
00:45:26,864 --> 00:45:29,779
- (men wolf-whistle and gasp)
- Oh, yes!

564
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:33,983
- Oh... oh...
- Aoow!

565
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:38,910
We've detained Miss Demeanor
long enough. Um...

566
00:45:38,994 --> 00:45:41,614
You can go now.
Sorry to have troubled you.

567
00:45:41,831 --> 00:45:47,617
No trouble. But I'll need transportation
home. Anybody want to give me a ride?

568
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:51,372
- (men) Pick me! Pick me!
- (cocks gun) Back off!

569
00:45:51,461 --> 00:45:54,329
<i>(# synth rock)</i>

If I were you, I wouldn't leave town.

00:46:12,347 --> 00:46:14,506
Oh, I won't. I live here.

572
00:46:14,849 --> 00:46:19,472
- Sorry if it was a little rough on you.
- You're just doing your job.

573

I want a home, a family...

00:46:23,645 --> 00:46:25,851
<i>...an occasional spanking.</i>

575
00:46:25,938 --> 00:46:28,095
I used a rolled-up newspaper
to spank Claire once.

576
00:46:30,857 --> 00:46:34,770
Thanks for bringing me back.
It was nice meeting you.

577
00:46:34,944 --> 00:46:37,313
Nice meeting you, too.

578
00:46:41,154 --> 00:46:44,985
- I hope it was a successful performance.
- Yeah.

579
00:46:45,074 --> 00:46:48,819
Good. I think we may have stumbled on
the whereabouts of the microfilm.

580
00:46:48,908 --> 00:46:52,027
Mr Jigsaw,
use your powers of persuasion...

583
00:46:57,705 --> 00:47:01,748
They're not onto you.
No more innocent people have to suffer.

584
00:47:02,124 --> 00:47:04,910
You're letting compassion intrude.

585
00:47:05,084 --> 00:47:07,538
It's an unbecoming trait.

586

I am your worst nightmare.

590
00:47:29,223 --> 00:47:33,764
No, waking up without my penis
is my worst nightmare.

591
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,055
OK. All right.

592
00:47:36,143 --> 00:47:40,850
<i>So I'm not your worst nightmare,
but I'm right up there!</i>

- What's going on here?

Drop the gun, Mr Luger!
