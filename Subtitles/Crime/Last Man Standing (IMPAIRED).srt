00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,814
DON'T WORRY.
WORKING FOR STROZZI
HAS ITS ADVANTAGES.

159
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,316
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE
YOUR ROOM.

160
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,820
Smith: THE SKIRT WAS FROM
JUST OUTSIDE OF CICERO.

161
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,822
STROZZI TOLD ME
HE HAD HER SENT DOWN HERE

162
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,324
TO KEEP UP HIS MORALE,

163
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,327
BUT THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
I EVER HEARD IT CALLED THAT.

164
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,330
YOU TRY AND KEEP IT
DOWN UP HERE, OK?

165
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,331
MY ROOM'S
RIGHT UNDERNEATH.

166
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,833
I'LL TRY NOT TO MAKE
TOO MUCH NOISE

167
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,836
WHEN I'M JUMPING
UP AND DOWN ON THE BED.

168
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:32,838
Smith: SUNDAY DINNER
WAS A REAL EVENT.

169
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,341
STROZZI MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A SMALL-TIME HOOD,

170
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,842
BUT HE TRIED TO RUN THINGS

171
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,345
LIKE HE WAS SOMEBODY IMPORTANT
BACK IN CHICAGO.

172
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,847
HE HAD AN ARMY
OF 20 SHOOTERS.

173
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:45,351
AS FAR AS I COULD SEE,
MOST OF THEM WERE GOOFBALLS.

174
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,354
IT WAS ALL
RIGHT OUT OF SOME DIME NOVEL.

175
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,863
Strozzi:
HOW'S THE FOOD?

176
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,365
Smith: GOOD.

177
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,867
HUH? I BROUGHT
THESE MAMAS
IN FROM CHICAGO.

178
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,869
FOOD HERE
WAS TERRIBLE.

179
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,371
IT'S GOOD, HUH?

180
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,872
YEAH. I LIKE GARLIC.

181
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,374
ALL RIGHT.

182
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,888
WHAT IS THIS? NOBODY WAITS?

183
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,390
Strozzi:
YOU'RE LATE.

184
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,891
I HAD IMPORTANT BUSINESS.

185
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,894
WHILE YOU WERE DOING
YOUR IMPORTANT
BUSINESS,

ARE HAPPENING.

00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,898
WE NOW HAVE
A NEW EMPLOYEE.

188
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,902
MR. SMITH, THIS IS
GIORGIO CORMONTE.

00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:40,406

THAT'S DOYLE'S BEST GUY
NEXT TO HICKEY.

NO?

191
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,409
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

192
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,910
AND YOU HIRE HIM.

193
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,412
YEAH.

194
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,414
YEAH, WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT LOOKS LIKE TO DOYLE

195
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:49,415
IN KEEPING A TRUCE?

196
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,916
YOU WANT TO TIP
DOYLE OFF?

197

PLUS, WHO THE HELL
IS HE?

198
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,919
DOYLE'S GUYS
ARE SCARED OF HIM.

199
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,922
HELL, HE WAS IN TOWN
20 MINUTES,
HE KILLED ONE OF THEM.

200
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,925
DOYLE AIN'T GONNA
DO A GODDAMN THING
WITH HICKEY OUT OF TOWN.

201
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,927
THE ONLY THING
THAT COCKROACH MIGHT TRY

202
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:03,929
IS TO HIRE THIS GUY
FOR HIMSELF.

YEAH, WELL,
I DON'T LIKE IT.

NEW FACES--

WITH ME, GIORGIO,

Smith: SO I DECIDED TO GIVE UP
MY FREE ROOM.

210
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:36,962
I HAD SEEN THE REAL THING,

211
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,466
AND THESE GUYS
WERE A LONG WAY FROM IT.

212
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,972
I WASN'T SURE IF HE WAS GETTING
A WOODEN BOX READY FOR ME

213
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:50,476
OR IF HE JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANKS FOR THE BUSINESS.

214
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,486
WELL, LOOK
WHO'S HERE.

00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:25,010
HE DON'T TALK MUCH,
BUT HIS EARS WORK GOOD.

STAYIN' WITH YOUR FRIENDS
AT THE SWEETWATER.

THAT USED TO COME SEE ME

236
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,012
WHEN I WORKED
IN NEW ORLEANS.

237
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,514

LIKE YOU.

YOU EVER BEEN
TO NEW ORLEANS?

HE WAS NICE.

312
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,687
YEAH.

313
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,189
BUT ONLY
IN THE BEDROOM.

314
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,195
Smith: AS USUAL,
SHE WAS TRYING TO ACT TOUGH,

315
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,698
BUT ANYBODY COULD SEE
IT WAS PAPER-THIN.

316
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,701
EVEN WITH A SECOND-RATER
LIKE STROZZI,

317
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,203
SHE WAS IN
WAY OVER HER HEAD.

318
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,003
WELL, FOR CHRIST'S SWEET SAKE.
IT TOOK YOU TWO LONG ENOUGH.

319
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:38,006
KISS MY ASS.

320
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:41,009
IT'S RAINING OUTSIDE,
GIORGIO.

321
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:43,011
HARD TO DRIVE
IN THE RAIN.

322
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:46,014
LIKE HE SAID,
WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG?

323
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:49,017
MAYBE YOU DON'T
HEAR TOO GOOD--
IT'S RAINING.

324
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,020
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
YOU'RE GETTING TO BE

325
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,022
MORE OF
A WISE-ASS POLACK
EVERY DAY,

326
00:22:54,022 --> 00:22:56,024
AND IT AIN'T
SO CUTE NO MORE.

327
00:22:56,024 --> 00:22:59,027
YOU KNOW WHAT
HAPPENS TO WISE-ASS
POLACK DAMES?

328
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:01,530
THEY GET THEIR
WISE ASSES KICKED!

329
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:05,534
WHEN I WAS IN
THIS WHOREHOUSE,

330
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:08,036
DOYLE SENT A COUPLE GUYS
TO VISIT ME.

331
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:12,541
I HAD TO KILL THEM BOTH.

332
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,543
YOU KILLED 2 MORE
OF DOYLE'S GUYS?

333
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:17,045
IS THAT BULLSHIT,
OR IS THAT TRUE?

334
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:19,548
LOOK, I DON'T GIVE
A DAMN ABOUT DOYLE.

335
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:22,551
IF HE LOST
2 MEN TONIGHT,
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

336
00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:24,553
THIS DOYLE,
HE'S TRYING
TO OUTBID ME

337
00:23:24,553 --> 00:23:26,555
WITH
MY OWN SUPPLIERS,
MICK BASTARD.

338
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:29,558
YEAH, I TRY TO DO
BUSINESS WITH HIM,
IT'S BULLSHIT.

339
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:32,561
NOW, WE GOT
A SHIPMENT COMING IN

340
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:34,062
FROM MONTERREY
NEXT WEEK.

341
00:23:34,062 --> 00:23:37,065
MR. DOYLE HAS GOT
ONE COMING IN
TOMORROW.

342
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:41,570
THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE
GOING TO START
TO EARN YOUR PAY.

343
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,582
Strozzi: THAT'S 5 TRUCKS.

344
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:55,083
MAYBE 200 CASES.

345
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,586
WE DELIVER
200 BUCKS A CASE.

346
00:23:57,586 --> 00:24:00,088
THAT'S 200 GRAND
IN OUR BOOKS.

347
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:02,591
PLUS, YOU KNOW WHAT'S
REALLY THE FROSTING?

348
00:24:02,591 --> 00:24:04,092
WE GET DOYLE'S TRUCKS.

349
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:08,096
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO BUY A TRUCK IN MEXICO?

350
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:19,107
Smith: WE CROSSED THE BORDER
A COUPLE HOURS BEFORE DAWN.

351
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:21,109
STROZZI HAD COME UP WITH A PLAN

352
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:23,612
THAT HE THOUGHT
WOULD MAKE HIM LOOK GOOD

353
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:25,614
TO THE BIG BOSS
BACK IN CHICAGO.

354
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:29,618
IT INVOLVED HIJACKING, MURDER,
CORRUPTION OF THE MILITARY,

355
00:24:30,118 --> 00:24:32,621
AND STICKING ME
RIGHT OUT FRONT.

356
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:40,629
WHO IN THE HELL
ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE?

357
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:44,633
THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME
FOR YOU GUYS TO GIVE UP.

358
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:48,136
BUENO, AMIGOS.
ENSENEN
NUESTRAS ARMAS.

359
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,141
WHAT THE HELL'S
THIS?

360
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:54,643
I TOLD YOU
WE COULDN'T TRUST
THESE MEXICANS.

361
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:58,647
I'M GOING TO SEND SMITH
BACK WITH SANTO
TO KEEP AN EYE ON DOYLE.

362
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:02,651
YOU STAY WITH THE TRUCKS
TILL THEY GET
TO MATAMOROS.

363
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:06,154
MATALOS.

364
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:22,170
Smith: IT WAS A MASSACRE.

365
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:24,673
COULDN'T SAY
I WAS REAL SORRY,

366
00:25:24,673 --> 00:25:28,176
BUT IT WAS A ROUGH WAY
TO CHECK OUT.

367
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,282
Sheriff: NOW,
I DON'T KNOW
HOW RELIABLE

368
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,785
SHE'S EVER
GOING TO HOLD UP
AS A WITNESS.

369
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,787
SHE'S SOME KIND
OF A VAGRANT.

370
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,273
MIGHT EVEN
BE HERE FOR
IMMORAL PURPOSES.

371
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,275
HOW MUCH
TO GET HER OUT?

372
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:46,778
OH, 100 WILL
SEND HER ON HER
WAY RIGHT AWAY.

373
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:50,782
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT HOW DOYLE'S MEN KNEW
I WAS AT THAT WHOREHOUSE.

374
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,785
I FIGURE YOUR DEPUTY HERE
HEARD ME LAST NIGHT
AT THE RED BIRD,

375
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,787
CAME OVER HERE
AND TOLD YOU ABOUT IT,

376
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,789
AND YOU SOLD
THE INFORMATION TO DOYLE.

377
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,292
HOW AM I DOING
SO FAR, SHERIFF?

378
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:04,296
WELL, YOU ARE ONE
SUSPICIOUS FELLA.
AIN'T HE, BOB?

379
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,799
MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE
ROUGH ON YOU LAST NIGHT.

380
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,301
MAYBE I SHORTCHANGED YOU.

381
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:12,304
IF I WAS YOU,
I'D GET OUT OF HERE.

382
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,307
DOYLE'S MEN
ARE GOING TO THINK
YOU TIPPED ME OFF.

383
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:19,311
YOU GOT A BUS
COMES THROUGH THIS TOWN?

384
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,813
Sheriff: YEAH.
AT NOON EVERY DAY.

385
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,819
MAKE SURE
SHE GETS ON IT.

386
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,822
I GOT SOME INFORMATION
YOU MAY WANT TO SELL
TO MR. DOYLE.

387
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,324
HE'S GOING TO FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH,

388
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,326
BUT YOU MIGHT BE
THE ONE TO GIVE IT TO HIM.

389
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,828
A SHIPMENT OF BOOZE
HE HAD COMING UP
FROM MEXICO

390
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,830
GOT HIJACKED
BY SOME BANDITOS.

391
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,834
A TIP LIKE THAT
OUGHT TO BE WORTH
AT LEAST A GRAND.

392
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:47,839
YOU BETTER BE RIGHT,
BECAUSE IF DOYLE SHOULD
SEND HICKEY AFTER ME,

393
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,342
HE'S COMING
DIRECTLY FOR YOU.

394
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,344
YEAH. I KEEP
HEARING ABOUT HICKEY.

395
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,346
SOUNDS LIKE
A REAL SCARY GUY.

396
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,848
LET ME TELL YOU
JUST HOW SCARY.

397
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,851
IT GOES THAT WHEN
HE WAS 10 YEARS OLD,

398
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:04,856
GETS A BUTCHER KNIFE
AND CUTS HIS FATHER'S
THROAT FROM EAR TO EAR.

399
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,359
THEN THEY STICK HIM
IN AN ORPHANAGE.

400
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,363
15 YEARS OLD, HE BURNS
IT TO THE GROUND.

401
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:15,367
YOU JUST MAKE SURE
YOU MARK ME DOWN FOR
HALF OF THAT THOUSAND.

402
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:25,427
THINK MAYBE
YOU AND I SHOULD TALK.

403
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:28,430
I DON'T THINK THESE
PEOPLE APPRECIATE YOU.

404
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:34,936
YOU GOING TO BE
MY HERO?

405
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:39,441
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST A GUY WHO DID
THINGS FOR MONEY.

406
00:27:39,441 --> 00:27:43,445
YEAH. I'M JUST A GUY
THAT DOES EVERYTHING
FOR MONEY.

407
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:48,950
ANYBODY SEE YOU
COME UP HERE?

408
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:50,452
NO.

409
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:56,958
APPRECIATE ME?
YOU DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF IT.

410
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,460
LET ME TELL YOU,

411
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,962
I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT
FROM THESE BASTARDS.

412
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:04,966
GOING BACK TO CHICAGO
ON THE FIRST THING OUT
OF HERE THAT MOVES.

413
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:05,967
[CHUCKLING]

414
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:07,969
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

415
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:09,971
YOU'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

416
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:12,974
YOU'RE JUST BLOWING OFF
A LITTLE STEAM.

417
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:16,978
OH, YEAH? YOU HEAR
THE WAY STROZZI
TALKED TO ME?

418
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:18,480
THAT GREASE BALL?

419
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,981
TO HELL WITH HIM.

420
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:22,984
YOU KNOW,
STROZZI'S OUT OF
TOWN FOR THE DAY.

421
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:23,985
SO IS GIORGIO.

422
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:25,487
SO?

423
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:28,490
DID STROZZI TELL YOU
HE'S PAYING ME
A LOT OF MONEY?

424
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,492
WELL, THERE MAY BE
A WAY FOR YOU

425
00:28:30,492 --> 00:28:32,994
TO GET YOUR HANDS
ON SOME OF IT.

426
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:37,499
YOU GOING TO TELL ME
WHY YOU WOULD DO
SUCH A NICE THING?

427
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:40,001
BECAUSE I'M
A NICE GUY...

428
00:28:40,001 --> 00:28:42,003
A SWEET GUY.

429
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:44,506
YEAH, RIGHT.

430
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,012
LIKE I SAID...

431
00:28:52,514 --> 00:28:54,516
I DON'T THINK THEY
APPRECIATE YOU.

432
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:58,520
SEE, I THINK YOU'RE
A VERY SMART GIRL.

433
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:04,025
YOU HEAR THINGS...
INSIDE WORD.

434
00:29:05,527 --> 00:29:09,030
I'M THE KIND OF GUY
THAT LIKES TO HAVE

435
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,534
ALL THE INFORMATION
HE CAN GET,

436
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:17,539
SO IF YOU GIVE ME
THE INSIDE WORD,

437
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:21,042
I'LL GIVE YOU
AN EXTRA HUNDRED
OR SO A WEEK,

438
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:23,545
JUST BETWEEN
ME AND YOU.

439
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:35,557
Smith: STROZZI AND GIORGIO WERE
GOING TO BE BACK THE NEXT DAY,

440
00:29:35,557 --> 00:29:40,562
BUT I SMELLED THE REAL MONEY
WAS GOING TO COME FROM WORKING
DOYLE'S SIDE OF THE STREET.

441
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:42,564
THEY'D MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.

442
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,074
MR. DOYLE WANTS YOU
TO COME WORK FOR US FULL-TIME.

443
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:55,577
I'M NOT SURE
HE CAN AFFORD IT.

444
00:29:55,577 --> 00:29:57,078
TRY ME.

445
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:59,080
$1,000.

446
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,584
A WEEK OR A DAY?

447
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:07,589
I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE
NOT MAD AT ME.

448
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:10,091
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
HOLD IT AGAINST ME,

449
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:12,594
ME KILLING
3 OF YOUR GUYS.

450
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:16,097
IT'S THE ONLY CURE I KNOW
FOR BEING STUPID.

451
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,102
HEY, DUMMY. BRING US
YOUR BEST STUFF.

452
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:24,606
YES, SIR, MR. DOYLE.
RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

453
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,114
I KNOW YOU ALREADY
GOT A JOB WORKING
FOR STROZZI,

454
00:30:33,114 --> 00:30:37,118
BUT I FIGURE YOU FOR
THE KIND OF GUY WHO GOES
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER,

455
00:30:37,118 --> 00:30:39,120
JUST LIKE THOSE MEXICANS

456
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,623
THAT WERE SUPPOSED
TO GUARD MY BOOZE.

457
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:45,126
[LAUGHING]

458
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:47,629
STROZZI WAS BEHIND THAT,
WASN'T HE?

459
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:56,638
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO KILL STROZZI AND THAT

00:30:56,638 --> 00:31:00,141
FROM WHAT I HEAR,
A GUY LIKE YOURSELF,

461
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:03,144
YOU ONLY CARE ABOUT
THE MONEY, RIGHT?

462
00:31:03,144 --> 00:31:05,647
I MEAN IT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

463
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:07,649
THAT'S WHY
WE'RE ALL HERE.

ABOUT HICKEY, HUH?

I HEARD HE TALKS
KIND OF FUNNY.

AWFUL MESSY, THOUGH.

THIS SHOULD BE
AN INSIDE JOB.

WE NEED SOMEBODY
NICE AND NEAT, LIKE YOU.

YOU'RE MAKING
A MISTAKE!

NOT VERY SMART.

BE THERE TO ENJOY IT.

Smith: I MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A GUN FOR HIRE,

00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:06,708
BUT I WASN'T EXACTLY
AN ASSASSIN.

THERE WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENCE.

I SAID HELLO.

482
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:14,716
IF I WAS GOING
TO GET INTO DOYLE'S WALLET,

00:32:14,716 --> 00:32:17,218
I NEEDED SOMETHING BIG

Doyle: GOOD.
KEEP TALKING.

A COP DOWN THERE, TOO.

WAS SECURITY ON THIS
SIDE OF THE BORDER,

TO HAPPEN TO HIM...

I'M HERE ABOUT
A MURDERED POLICEMAN.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER

BUT THE MAN
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

708
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,592
WAS AN AMERICAN
ON THE BORDER PATROL.

709

HE HAD A FAMILY. WELL LIKED
BY HIS BROTHER OFFICERS.

710
00:48:34,595 --> 00:48:37,097
I GUESS HE STRAYED A LITTLE BIT
IN SOME DEPARTMENTS,

711
00:48:37,598 --> 00:48:41,101
BUT HE WAS AN OFFICER OF THE LAW
JUST THE SAME.

ABOUT HIS DEATH, SON?

NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

THAT'S ODD.

715

DON'T HARDLY
SEEM POSSIBLE.

AROUND HERE.

718
00:48:57,117 --> 00:48:59,620
YOU SAYING I DID IT?

719
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,624
I ASKED IF YOU KNEW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT,
NOT IF YOU DID IT.

720
00:49:03,624 --> 00:49:06,126
THE CRIME
HAS BEEN SOLVED, SON.

721
00:49:06,126 --> 00:49:09,129
MEXICAN POLICE PICKED
UP 2 ARMED DRIFTERS FROM
THE STATE OF FLORIDA

722
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:10,130
JUST ACROSS THE BORDER,

723
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,632
HANDED THEM OVER TO US.

724
00:49:12,132 --> 00:49:14,635
THEY AIN'T CONFESSED
YET, BUT THEY WILL.

725
00:49:14,635 --> 00:49:18,639
I JUST CAN'T GET PAST
THE IDEA THAT MAYBE

726
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:22,643
ONE OF THESE 2
BOOTLEG GANGS HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

727
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:26,647
I LEARNED
A LONG TIME AGO
TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS.

728
00:49:26,647 --> 00:49:31,151
NOW, LISTEN
REAL CAREFUL BECAUSE
HERE IS THE POINT, SON.

729
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:34,154
THINGS IN THIS TOWN
ARE OUT OF CONTROL.

730
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:37,157
2 GANGS IS JUST
ONE TOO MANY.

731
00:49:37,157 --> 00:49:38,659
I'M NOT AN IDEALIST.

732
00:49:38,659 --> 00:49:43,163
I KNOW A LOT OF THINGS
THAT PEOPLE DO
ARE AWFUL LOW,

733
00:49:43,163 --> 00:49:46,667
BUT THAT'S BETWEEN
THEM AND GOD.

734
00:49:46,667 --> 00:49:48,669
DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?

735
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,673
I BELIEVE IN GOD, SON,

736
00:49:52,673 --> 00:49:56,677
BUT WHAT I'M CONCERNED
WITH IS KEEPING A LID
ON THINGS,

737
00:49:56,677 --> 00:50:00,681
AND WHAT WE GOT HERE
IN JERICHO IS JUST
WAY OUT OF HAND,

738
00:50:00,681 --> 00:50:03,684
AND SHERIFF GALT HERE,
HE CAN'T DO MUCH ABOUT
IT, RIGHT?

739
00:50:03,684 --> 00:50:05,686
MATTER OF FACT,
IT MIGHT BE FAIR TO SAY

740
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:08,188
THAT HE'S PART OF
THE PROBLEM, RIGHT?

741
00:50:08,188 --> 00:50:10,691
NOW, YOU BEEN GOING
BACK AND FORTH
PLAYING BOTH SIDES,

742
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:12,693
ACCORDING
TO MR. GALT HERE,

743
00:50:12,693 --> 00:50:15,696
MAKING YOURSELF
A LOT OF MONEY
OUT OF ALL THIS.

744
00:50:15,696 --> 00:50:18,699
WELL, IT'S OVER, SON.

745
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:21,702
I'M COMING BACK HERE
IN 10 DAYS.

746
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:25,706
I'M GOING TO BRING ABOUT
20 RANGERS WITH ME.

747
00:50:25,706 --> 00:50:29,209
I WILL TOLERATE
ONE GANG BECAUSE THAT
IS THE NATURE OF THINGS.

748
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:32,212
A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF CORRUPTION
IS INEVITABLE,

749
00:50:32,212 --> 00:50:34,715
BUT IF I FIND
2 GANGS HERE
WHEN I GET BACK,

750
00:50:34,715 --> 00:50:39,219
THEN IN A COUPLE OF
HOURS THERE WILL BE
NO GANGS HERE,

751
00:50:39,219 --> 00:50:44,224
SO IT'S SIMPLE.
ONE GANG QUITS
AND GOES HOME.

752
00:50:45,225 --> 00:50:49,229
YOU BOYS WORK IT OUT.
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
WHICH ONE.

753
00:50:49,229 --> 00:50:53,734
JUST AS LONG
AS ONE SIDE LEAVES
OR MAYBE ONE SIDE LOSES.

754
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:55,736
THAT'S FINE,
TOO, SON.

755
00:50:55,736 --> 00:50:57,738
KILL AS MANY
AS YOU WANT,

756
00:50:57,738 --> 00:51:00,240
JUST DON'T KILL
NO INNOCENT PEOPLE
AROUND HERE.

757
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,743
I WOULDN'T
LIKE THAT.

758
00:51:06,747 --> 00:51:09,249
IT'S BEEN REAL NICE
TALKING TO YOU, CAPTAIN.

759
00:51:09,249 --> 00:51:11,752
LIKEWISE, SON.

760
00:51:11,752 --> 00:51:14,254
ONLY ONE MORE THING.

01:05:33,045 --> 01:05:36,048
THIS WHOLE THING
IS TURNING ON US.

918
01:05:39,552 --> 01:05:41,554
WHEN YOU FOUND THEM
OUT HERE,

919
01:05:41,554 --> 01:05:44,056
WHY DIDN'T YOU DRIVE
BACK TO TOWN AND TELL US

920
01:05:44,056 --> 01:05:45,558
INSTEAD OF JUST
WAITING OUT HERE?

921
01:05:45,558 --> 01:05:49,061
I FIGURED THE GIRL RAN OFF
WHEN THE FIGHTING STARTED.

922
01:05:49,061 --> 01:05:52,064
I STUCK AROUND, HOPING
MAYBE SHE'D COME BACK.

923
01:05:53,566 --> 01:05:55,067
SHE DIDN'T.

924
01:06:04,577 --> 01:06:06,579
THIS ONE HASN'T
BEEN FIRED.

925
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,583
MUST HAVE GOT KILLED
BEFORE HE GOT A SHOT OFF.

926
01:06:15,588 --> 01:06:19,091
Doyle: STROZZI'S
JEALOUS OF ME
GIVING HER A CHANCE.

927
01:06:20,593 --> 01:06:24,597
SHE GREW UP IN SOME
FILTHY LITTLE VILLAGE.

928
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:30,102
TOLD ME HER MOTHER
WAS A YAQUI INDIAN.

929
01:06:32,104 --> 01:06:35,107
DIDN'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT HER FATHER...

930
01:06:35,608 --> 01:06:37,610
EXCEPT HE WAS WHITE.

931
01:06:39,111 --> 01:06:41,614
SHE MARRIED
SOME LOWLIFE WETBACK.

932
01:06:42,114 --> 01:06:46,118
THE ONLY THING
HE EVER GAVE HER...

933
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:48,120
WAS A KID.

934
01:06:51,624 --> 01:06:55,628
JESUS CHRIST, SHE
ONLY HAD ONE DRESS
TILL SHE MET ME.

935
01:06:55,628 --> 01:06:58,631
THE WAY
SHE LOOKED...

936
01:07:02,134 --> 01:07:04,136
THE WAY HER EYES
LOOKED...

937
01:07:05,638 --> 01:07:09,141
I COULDN'T HELP
TAKING HER OUT
OF ALL THAT.

938
01:07:13,646 --> 01:07:16,148
WE GOT TO HIT
STROZZI SOON.

939
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:19,151
GET HER BACK.

940
01:07:20,653 --> 01:07:23,656
WE HAVE TO
GET THIS THING
OVER WITH.

941
01:07:24,156 --> 01:07:25,658
I'M GOING TO HEAD
BACK INTO TOWN,

942
01:07:25,658 --> 01:07:28,160
SEE WHAT
I CAN FIND OUT.

943
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,664
MAYBE STROZZI DOESN'T KNOW
I WORK FOR YOU GUYS YET.

944
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:37,670
WE HAVE TO GET
THIS THING OVER WITH.

945
01:07:43,175 --> 01:07:45,177
Smith: HICKEY
WAS SUSPICIOUS,

946
01:07:45,678 --> 01:07:48,180
DOYLE WAS NUTS,
AND McCOOL WAS STUPID,

947
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:50,683
EXCEPT MAYBE
I WAS THE DUMB ONE.

948
01:07:51,183 --> 01:07:52,184
IF I HAD ANY BRAINS,

949
01:07:52,685 --> 01:07:56,188
I WOULD HAVE KEPT ON DRIVING
STRAIGHT SOUTH INTO MEXICO.

950
01:08:12,204 --> 01:08:14,707
KEEP IT GASSED UP
AND READY TO GO.

951
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:16,208
YES, SIR.
I'LL DO HER,

952
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:18,711
BUT PRETTY SOON,
YOU GONNA BE
ON YOUR OWN.

953
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:20,713
COME NEXT WEEK,
I'M GETTING
THE HELL OUT.

954
01:08:20,713 --> 01:08:22,214
T'AIN'T NO
BUSINESS HERE.

955
01:08:22,214 --> 01:08:26,218
THIS TOWN...
IS FINISHED.

956
01:08:34,927 --> 01:08:37,930
Smith: AS USUAL,
IT WAS HOT AS HELL,

957
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:41,934
AND THE WIND PICKED UP
THE DUST SO MUCH,
YOU COULD TASTE IT.

958
01:08:41,934 --> 01:08:44,937
THE WHISKEY HELPED,
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO GET SLOPPY,

959
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:46,939
SO I SWITCHED TO BEER.

960
01:08:54,446 --> 01:08:58,450
SOMEHOW I HAD THE FEELING
THE WALLS WERE MOVING IN ON ME.

961
01:08:58,951 --> 01:09:02,955
IT'S FUNNY
HOW IT ALL WORKS OUT.

962
01:09:02,955 --> 01:09:04,456
FOR ONE LITTLE SECOND,

963
01:09:04,456 --> 01:09:08,961
YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO
GET AWAY FREE AND CLEAR.

964
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:12,464
BUT YOU END UP
PAYING THE PRICE.

965
01:09:12,464 --> 01:09:14,466
NO EXCEPTIONS.

966
01:09:14,466 --> 01:09:16,969
EVERYBODY PAYS
THE PRICE...

967
01:09:17,469 --> 01:09:19,471
EVEN A BUM LIKE ME.

968
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,481
TAKE THE GUNS.

969
01:09:32,985 --> 01:09:34,987
WHAT IS IT?

970
01:09:38,991 --> 01:09:41,994
STROZZI DOESN'T HAVE
DOYLE'S HALF-BREED.

971
01:09:41,994 --> 01:09:44,997
McCOOL WENT
ACROSS THE BORDER
LOOKING FOR HER.

972
01:09:44,997 --> 01:09:47,499
DOWN IN EL MORADO,

973
01:09:47,499 --> 01:09:50,502
HE RAN INTO A GUY WITH
AN INTERESTING STORY.

974
01:09:50,502 --> 01:09:52,504
HE'D SEEN HER
HEADING OUT.

975
01:09:52,504 --> 01:09:55,007
SHE'D SOLD OUR CAR
TO SOME GUY FOR
A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS

976
01:09:55,007 --> 01:09:57,009
AND TOOK A BUS SOUTH.

977
01:09:57,009 --> 01:10:01,013
SO...STROZZI
DIDN'T TAKE HER.

978
01:10:01,013 --> 01:10:05,017
MAYBE...IF YOU BELIEVE
THE GUY'S STORY.

979
01:10:05,017 --> 01:10:07,019
WHY WOULD
A GUY LIE?

980
01:10:07,019 --> 01:10:10,022
WHICH LEAVES THE QUESTION
OF HOW SHE GOT AWAY.

981
01:10:10,022 --> 01:10:12,024
BIG QUESTION.

982
01:10:12,024 --> 01:10:15,027
NOT THAT
WE GIVE A DAMN.

983
01:10:15,027 --> 01:10:16,996
Hickey: INDIAN GIRL,
YOU KNOW.

984
01:10:16,996 --> 01:10:20,499
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE WAS
THE BLESSED VIRGIN, IS IT?

985
01:10:22,501 --> 01:10:24,003
OUT THERE
IN THE COUNTRY...

986
01:10:24,503 --> 01:10:26,005
ONLY A REAL FINE GUNNER

987
01:10:26,505 --> 01:10:29,008
COULD HANDLE THAT MANY
ALL BY HIMSELF,

988
01:10:29,508 --> 01:10:31,010
BUT YOU WORK FOR US.

989
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:33,512
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

990
01:10:37,516 --> 01:10:40,019
MAYBE YOU DON'T
WORK FOR US.

991
01:10:40,019 --> 01:10:43,022
MAYBE YOU TAKE THE MONEY,
DO WHAT YOU WANT.

992
01:10:43,022 --> 01:10:46,525
YOU'RE ONE OF THEM.
YOU'RE AN INDEPENDENT.

993
01:10:46,525 --> 01:10:48,527
WHO ARE YOU RUNNING FROM?

994
01:10:48,527 --> 01:10:52,531
JERICHO'S
A GOOD PLACE TO STOP
ON YOUR WAY TO MEXICO

995
01:10:52,531 --> 01:10:54,533
RUNNING FROM THE FEDS.

996
01:10:54,533 --> 01:10:57,536
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES,
EVERYBODY'S RUNNING
FROM SOMETHING.

997
01:10:57,536 --> 01:11:01,540
NAH. SEE, WORKING
FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME
AND DOYLE WORK FOR

998
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:03,042
HAS AN ADVANTAGE.

999
01:11:03,042 --> 01:11:05,544
THE PAYROLL COVERS
A LOT OF GROUND.

1000
01:11:15,054 --> 01:11:17,556
YOU'RE SCARED.

1001
01:11:19,558 --> 01:11:22,561
THE WATER'S
GETTING COLD.

1002
01:11:24,063 --> 01:11:26,065
[BODY BEING PUNCHED]

1003
01:11:26,065 --> 01:11:28,067
[SMITH GROANING]

1004
01:11:44,083 --> 01:11:46,085
WHERE IS SHE?

1005
01:12:28,127 --> 01:12:31,130
HE'S NOTHING...
WITHOUT A GUN.

1006
01:13:19,178 --> 01:13:21,680
Smith: AFTER A WHILE,
YOU STOP HEARING

1007
01:13:22,181 --> 01:13:24,183
YOUR BONES BREAK,
YOUR TEETH RATTLE.

1008
01:13:24,683 --> 01:13:26,185
YOU JUST CONCENTRATE
ON HOLDING TIGHT

1009
01:13:26,185 --> 01:13:29,188
TO THAT LITTLE PART
RIGHT AT THE CENTER.

1010
01:13:29,188 --> 01:13:31,190
THE REST DOESN'T MATTER.

1011
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:34,193
THEY'RE GOING TO
TAKE THE REST ANYWAY.

1012
01:13:36,195 --> 01:13:38,730
[THUNDER]

1013
01:14:13,232 --> 01:14:16,735
MUST HAVE CRAWLED OFF.

1014
01:14:58,277 --> 01:15:00,779
BLOCK THE STREETS!
WALL HIM UP!

1015
01:15:00,779 --> 01:15:03,782

01:15:10,789 --> 01:15:12,291
FIND HIM!

1020
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:14,793
McCool: YOU GUYS

1021
01:15:18,797 --> 01:15:20,799
GET THOSE CARS!

1022
01:15:20,799 --> 01:15:23,802

LET'S GO!

01:15:50,829 --> 01:15:52,831

FIND HIM! FIND HIM!

1030
01:16:02,841 --> 01:16:05,844
HE'S HERE!
HE'S GOT TO BE HERE!

1031
01:16:10,349 --> 01:16:12,851
SEARCH THIS PLACE!
UPSTAIRS! BEHIND THE BAR!

1032
01:16:12,851 --> 01:16:14,353
NOW! FIND HIM!

1033
01:16:14,353 --> 01:16:16,355
YOU. WHERE IS HE?
I KNOW HE'S HERE.

1034
01:16:16,355 --> 01:16:17,356
WHO?

1035
01:16:17,356 --> 01:16:20,359
SMITH! DON'T HOLD
OUT ON ME, YOU SHITHEEL!

1036
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:23,862
I'LL STICK A KNIFE
IN YOUR THROAT!

1037
01:16:27,366 --> 01:16:28,867
Man: CHECK
THE CLOSETS!

1038
01:16:33,872 --> 01:16:36,375
Doyle: I'M TELLING YOU--
DON'T YOU MESS WITH ME!

1039
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:39,378
THIS IS NOT A GAME!
DON'T PLAY AROUND!

1040
01:16:39,378 --> 01:16:40,879
YOU DON'T WANT TO
TALK TO ME?

1041
01:16:40,879 --> 01:16:42,881
YOU WON'T TALK
TO ANYBODY ANYMORE!

1042
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:44,883
YOU THINK
I'M KIDDING?

1043
01:16:44,883 --> 01:16:46,885
WHERE IS HE?

1044
01:16:48,387 --> 01:16:52,391
LITTLE FELLA...
DOESN'T WANT TO
TALK TO US.

1045
01:16:57,396 --> 01:17:00,399
HE CAME HERE,
DIDN'T HE?

1046
01:17:02,401 --> 01:17:04,903
HOLD IT!
GODDAMN IT! HOLD IT!

1047
01:17:04,903 --> 01:17:06,405
Doyle: YOU HOLD IT,
JOHN LAW!

1048
01:17:06,405 --> 01:17:07,906
IT'S GONE
WAY PAST YOU!

1049
01:17:07,906 --> 01:17:09,408
THIS THING
WITH STROZZI'S OVER!

1050
01:17:09,408 --> 01:17:11,410
STROZZI! YOU
KNOW WHERE HE
IS RIGHT NOW?

1051
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:12,911
HE'S HOLED UP
WITH THE REST
OF HIS GANG,

1052
01:17:12,911 --> 01:17:14,413
WAITING FOR
SOME NEW SHOOTERS

1053
01:17:14,413 --> 01:17:16,415
THAT ARE COMING
FROM BACK EAST
TO HELP HIM OUT.

1054
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,916
WHERE'S SMITH?

1055
01:17:17,916 --> 01:17:20,419
HE'S AT SLIM'S
ROADHOUSE.

1056
01:17:20,419 --> 01:17:24,423
WE CHECKED ALL OVER.
HE AIN'T UPSTAIRS.

1057
01:17:24,423 --> 01:17:25,924
COME ON! LOAD IT UP!

1058
01:17:25,924 --> 01:17:26,925
WE'RE GOING
TO THE ROADHOUSE!

1059
01:17:27,426 --> 01:17:29,428
YOU BETTER BE RIGHT!

1060
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:03,462
WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG?

1061
01:18:03,462 --> 01:18:05,464
I HAD TO MAKE IT
LOOK GOOD.

1062
01:18:20,979 --> 01:18:23,482
YOU KNOW,
MY HELPING YOU OUT

1063
01:18:23,482 --> 01:18:25,984
DON'T MAKE A HELL
OF A LOT OF SENSE,

1064
01:18:25,984 --> 01:18:27,986
BUT I'M BETTING
ON THE RANGER.

1065
01:18:27,986 --> 01:18:31,490
I KNOW THAT
THE BIG MONEY DAYS
ARE JUST ABOUT DONE,

1066
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:33,492
BUT DON'T KID
YOURSELF, BOYS.

1067
01:18:33,492 --> 01:18:36,495
IT COULD STILL
COME DOWN REAL HARD.

1068
01:18:36,995 --> 01:18:40,499
MR. SMITH, I WILL
HELP HIDE YOU,

1069
01:18:40,499 --> 01:18:42,501
BUT I PREFER
YOU BE UNARMED

1070
01:18:42,501 --> 01:18:45,003
AND ON YOUR WAY

01:35:14,108 --> 01:35:16,110
GODDAMN.
I WASN'T
REAL SURE

1223
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:18,612
THIS OLD GUN
WOULD STILL
SHOOT.

1224
01:35:21,115 --> 01:35:24,118
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU
GOT YOURSELF A NEW CAR.

1225
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:47,641
Smith: AND THAT WAS IT.

1226
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:50,644
IT ENDED ABOUT THE SAME PLACE
WHERE IT STARTED...

1227
01:35:50,644 --> 01:35:54,148
OUT IN THE DESERT
ON THE ROAD TO MEXICO.

1228
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:57,651
I WAS JUST AS BROKE
AS WHEN I ARRIVED,

1229
01:35:57,651 --> 01:36:00,654
BUT SOMETHING
WOULD TURN UP.

1230
01:36:00,654 --> 01:36:02,156
IT ALWAYS DOES.
