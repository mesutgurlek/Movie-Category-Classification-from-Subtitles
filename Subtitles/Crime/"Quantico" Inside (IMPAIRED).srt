The real bomber is inside the Bureau.

47
00:01:44,494 --> 00:01:47,293
It gives them special access,
knowledge of procedures.

After that, we have to
deliver you to federal prison.

find a second bomb or bomber

00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:04,326
in the next four hours, you'll be serving

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,403
Because before you go home
for your three-day weekend,

163
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,871
we're giving you some homework.

164
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,239
[Trainees groan] What?!

165
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:09,075
When you are an agent,

166
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,146
work will always be on your mind.

167
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:13,774
Victims will haunt you,
evidence will elude you,

168
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:15,475
cases will stay with you...

169
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,051
Particularly those that you fail to solve.

170
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:21,787
In local law enforcement,
they're called cold cases...

171
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:23,122
All but closed.

172
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:26,492
But in the Bureau,
we don't believe in cold cases.

173
00:06:26,527 --> 00:06:28,260
<i>All</i> our cases remain open.

174
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:32,297
These cases are referred to as
"pending inactive."

175
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,866
The agency likes to cycle them

176
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:35,801
through different agents over time,

177
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:37,569
hoping that someone will find something

178
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,937
that someone else missed.

179
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:42,775
So, your goal will be to look
through your inactive file

180
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,276
and find a new lead...

181
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:46,278
Something that the agents
on the case didn't think of.

182
00:06:46,313 --> 00:06:48,680
Now, if this seems all but impossible,

183
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:50,416
that's because it is.

184
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,152
But who knows?
Maybe one of you will surprise us.

185

Good luck. And Happy New Year.

I had this crazy feeling,

like someone was waiting
for me inside my apartment.

324
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:54,525
[Ringing] Okay.

325
00:11:56,296 --> 00:11:57,711
Ryan: Hello?

326
00:11:58,364 --> 00:11:59,630
- Hello?
- Stop!

327
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,753
Woman: Ryan? Is everything okay?

328
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:02,999
[Cellphone beeps] Hello?

329
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,085
I need a drink.

330
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,665
Well... We're out of wine,

331
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:13,344
and Postmates won't
deliver here. I've checked.

332
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,112
So... Maybe coffee?

333
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:17,224
The cafeteria's closed.

334
00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:19,071
I know where some is.

335
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:22,111
I'll be right back.

336
00:12:29,147 --> 00:12:31,395
I was going to steal your coffee.

337
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:32,729
Go ahead.

338
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,866
Just leave me enough to
spike my whiskey with.

339
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,934
It must be a terrible time for you,

340
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,603
with Charlie still missing.

341
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:41,077
Charlie's<i> not</i> missing.

342
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:43,373
Charlie is exactly where he wants to be.

343
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:45,976
But I thought the evidence
pointed to a kidnapping.

344
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:48,011
Only because I'm the
only one ready to accept

345
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:49,980
that he is the monster in this nightmare.

346
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:52,049
Or perhaps you don't want to think of him

347
00:12:52,084 --> 00:12:53,083
suffering somewhere

348
00:12:53,118 --> 00:12:55,514
and it's easier to make him a monster?

349
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:59,956
Why are you still here, Trainee Amin?

350
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:01,892
I don't want to go to Dearborn.

351
00:13:01,927 --> 00:13:04,210
It hasn't felt like home for a long time.

352
00:13:04,337 --> 00:13:06,563
And I see<i> you</i> don't
want to go home, either.

353
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,277
I might stay for a drink if you insist.

354
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:16,306
[Cellphone chimes]

355
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:19,507
Ugh. It's Nimah. She's in Miranda's office.

356
00:13:19,611 --> 00:13:22,072
You don't know who that was with Ryan.

357
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,686
- He's in L.A., right?
- Yeah.

358
00:13:23,748 --> 00:13:25,414
Doesn't he have, like, three sisters there?

359
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,027
Guys, that did not sound like a sister.

360
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:29,156
All right, get up.

361
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,520
Get up. Come on.

Vasquez.

363
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,656
Everyone stand on one foot.

364
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:35,791
- What? [Chuckles]
- Just do it.

365
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:37,026
[Laughs] Come on.

366
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:39,595
Whoever's the most sober
is gonna get in their car,

367
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,796
drive us to the Old Settler,

368
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:44,100
where whatever D.E.A. trainee or marine

369
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:46,878
who wants to buy our
midnight kisses can do so

370
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:49,106
for the price of cheap
drinks and good conversation.

371
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:49,771
[Knock on door]

372
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:51,892
Maybe not even <i>good</i> conversation.

373
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:53,349
[Laughter]

374
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:54,577
Whoop! Caleb!

375
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:57,179
Don't worry. I'm not "Magic Mike" -ing you.

376
00:13:57,655 --> 00:13:58,347
Nice.

377
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,824
When I got home,
instead of the normal, intimate

378
00:14:00,877 --> 00:14:02,280
Haas family holiday bloodletting,

379
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,708
there were 200 people at my house

380
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,922
and a tux laid out on my bed.

381
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:08,490
I panicked and I fled.

382
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:10,626
But you still put the tux on.

383
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:11,760
Yeah.

384
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:13,228
Do you see this?

385
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:15,163
I can't go back there alone.

386
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,398
I get that you don't want to be around

387
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:18,767
someone's happy family right now,
but I swear to you,

388
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:19,968
there's nothing familial about it,

389
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:21,603
and no one's gonna be happy.

390
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,868
Except for<i> me</i> if I have you by my side.

391
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:26,029
What do you say?

392
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:28,543
[Inhales sharply]

393
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:31,388
I'll only go if<i> they</i> can come, too.

394
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:39,220
Simon wouldn't have been able
to magnetize his key at home.

395
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:40,822
19 people asked for their key cards

396
00:14:40,857 --> 00:14:43,024
to be recoded within the past 12 hours.

397
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,527
Nine of these were on the list
of donor rooms at Simon's.

398
00:14:45,562 --> 00:14:47,228
Divide and conquer.

399
00:14:47,264 --> 00:14:48,830
Stay on comms.

400
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:51,933
FBI!

401
00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:52,734

402

403
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:57,038
Clear.

Simon!

406
00:15:00,177 --> 00:15:01,843
I don't know if this
thing is remote-controlled

407
00:15:01,878 --> 00:15:03,144
or movement-controlled.

408
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,479
I don't know anything.

409
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:06,681
I just know I woke up with it in my hands.

410
00:15:06,717 --> 00:15:08,817
But I'm pretty sure if I take
my fingers off this trigger,

411
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:10,985
this whole building's gonna blow.

412
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:14,996
- Nimah: Alex!
- Over here!

413
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,481
Careful.

414
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:21,285
The last thing I remember
is walking into my house

415
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,519
and someone grabbed me.

416
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,488
When I woke up,
this thing was taped to my hands.

417
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,584
But I'm sweating so much

418
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,565
that the tape's starting to get loose,

419
00:15:27,608 --> 00:15:29,307
- Okay.
- And I'm afraid my finger's gonna slip.

420
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,439
- You're okay.
- I need you to help me.

421
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,318
We saw your workshop...
The blueprints, the key card.

422
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,799
Somebody's framing me.

423
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,537
All right? Just like they framed Alex.

424
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:39,469
Look, find Oren.
He can tell you it wasn't me.

425

- Alex: Simon...
- He can tell you! Just find Oren!

426
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:42,439
- Simon...
- Elias: Simon, stop.

427
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,841
You came to me yesterday,
asking me to represent you

428
00:15:44,876 --> 00:15:46,576
so you'd have attorney/client privilege.

429
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,211
You asked me about extradition laws,

430
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:49,609
about flight manifests.

431
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:51,097
- You were going to run.
- No!

432
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:52,048
I wanted to make sure I wasn't gonna spend

433
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,944
the rest of my life in
prison for my stolen plans.

434
00:15:55,124 --> 00:15:57,952
I didn't hide anything from
you... <i>any</i> of you.

435
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,538
Look... Evidence found at my house,

436
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:02,024
me drugged and brought to a hotel...

437
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,826
Is any of that giving you déjà vu?

438
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:06,028
Let's not waste any more time, okay?

439
00:16:06,064 --> 00:16:08,931
Just tell us where the bomb is... please.

440
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:11,400
Think of who could have done this.

441
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:14,526
They are the only person who
can answer that question.

442
00:16:14,716 --> 00:16:16,205
You got to believe me.

443
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,431
- You grew up here?
- Are you kidding?

444
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:23,979
My mom waited to buy Hogwarts
until<i> after</i> my sister and I left

445
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:26,761
so we would learn humility and values.

00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:29,474
Where<i> is</i> your mother?
I'd like to thank her for trying.

447
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,386
And I can't wait to see
the look on her face

448
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:33,422

to somebody old enough to vote.

00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:05,153
- Yeah.
- I had a fever of 104,

467
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:06,788
and they still made me do the steeplechase.

468
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:07,789
My God.

469
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:09,558
If it wasn't an open bar already,

470
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,259
I would totally ask to buy you a drink.

471
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:13,128
And I would say, "yes,
please, and right away,"

472
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:15,481
but I promised my guy that
I'd meet him at the door.

473
00:17:15,629 --> 00:17:17,766
He's a good one, but he hates a party.

Usually, I can't feel my hand an hour in

I want to introduce you to...

484
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:37,418
Shelby Wyatt!

485
00:17:37,454 --> 00:17:39,187
Senator Haas, it is an honor.

486
00:17:39,222 --> 00:17:41,182
My husband's told me about you.

487
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:43,224
I didn't realize you guys
were on speaking terms.

488
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:44,802
Top of your class at Quantico...

489
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:47,493
After rebuilding your
family's business, no less.

490
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,076
Quite a feat. [Chuckles]

491
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:50,814
Your parents would be very proud.

492
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,867
I met them a few times.

493
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:55,102
I am so sorry for what happened.

494
00:17:55,138 --> 00:17:58,172
We lost too much that day...
Each and every one of us.

495
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:00,260
Oh, you were there.

496
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:02,143
I remember the photo in all the papers.

497
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:05,161
You, an agent, walked
right into that second tower

498
00:18:05,203 --> 00:18:06,860
when everyone else was
running the other way.

499
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:08,570
Yeah, that photo got her elected.

500
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:10,723
- Caleb!
- [Chuckling] What?

501
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:12,352
I'm proud of my mom.

502
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:14,588
My son sees everything I do as political...

503
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:15,922
Even raising him.

504
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:18,859
But I would have given it
all up if he'd asked me to.

505
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:20,494
Where's your father?

506
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:22,496
I promised I'd introduce him to Ben Carson.

507
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:24,164
God knows why. [Chuckles]

508
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,233
I look forward to speaking
to you again soon.

509
00:18:26,268 --> 00:18:27,799
Excuse me.

510
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:32,932
What's wrong? The great
Claire Haas approved.

511
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:36,404
I basically just got you the Iron Throne.

512
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:38,177
My dad doesn't even live in this house.

513
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:41,714
My parents... they don't talk
to each other on principle.

514
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,950
Something's going on.

515
00:18:43,985 --> 00:18:46,719
Every year, Miranda sends
some NAT to talk to me

516
00:18:46,755 --> 00:18:48,654
about that damn Vermeer theft.

517
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,723
Usually, they come to my office.

518
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,059
One guy caught me at Trader Joe's.

519
00:18:53,094 --> 00:18:56,062
But you're the first to
accost me at a cocktail party.

520
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:58,664
If you could just walk me
through the details... help me.

521
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:01,367
Sometimes, things just disappear.

522
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:04,370
Like<i> I</i> am... from this conversation.

523
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:07,540
I am gonna go get myself
that Martini I earned.

524
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:10,143
All right, well, I'll wait over here,
where it's safe.

525
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:12,512
Caleb.

526
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,080
Or not.

527
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:18,004
I have been hearing great things
about your training at Quantico.

528
00:19:19,387 --> 00:19:20,953
Your mother said I was wrong to doubt you.

529
00:19:20,988 --> 00:19:22,698
I'm beginning to believe she's right.

530
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,457
Well, you and Mom agreeing about<i> anything</i>

531
00:19:24,492 --> 00:19:26,592
is threat level bravo, so what gives?

532
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:28,394
Nothing gives. We've...

533
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:31,564
We've just been talking
a lot about you lately.

534
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:33,979
We're talking a<i> lot,</i> actually.

535
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:35,710
What, are you guys getting back together?

536
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:38,306
Well, she<i> has</i> said she wants
to give it another shot.

537
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,945
Thought you'd be happy.

538
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:42,412
<i>I</i> am.

539
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,848
This holiday is<i> way</i> worse
than Valentine's Day.

540
00:19:49,883 --> 00:19:52,150
At least then, if you're single,
you're not a<i> complete</i> failure.

541
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:55,153
But no one to kiss on
New Year's Eve... epic fail.

542
00:19:55,189 --> 00:19:56,188
[Sighs]

543
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:57,856
- Stop torturing yourself.
- I can't.

544
00:19:57,891 --> 00:19:59,257
Well, then stop torturing<i> me.</i>

545
00:19:59,293 --> 00:20:01,860
- Call him and tell him you made a mistake.
- But if he's with someone else, there's...

546
00:20:01,895 --> 00:20:03,507
You just saw him two weeks ago.

547
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:06,408
He didn't meet, fall in love with,
and marry a woman in two weeks.

548
00:20:06,474 --> 00:20:09,134
No more blocking.
Click that contact.

549
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:12,971
[Sighs]

550
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:15,106
[Cellphone beeps]

551
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:16,674
[Ringing]

552
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,444
[Cellphone ringing]

553
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,612
[Ringing continues]

554
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:23,915
[Ringing continues]

555
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,249
[Ringing continues]

556
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:26,551
[Ringing continues]

557
00:20:26,586 --> 00:20:27,752
[Ringing stops]

558
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:29,582
Alex?

559
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:33,974
Look, if I was the bomber,

560
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,493
wouldn't I have gone
through with it already?

561
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:37,061
The convention isn't for hours.

562
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:39,163
The convention?
What does that have to do with this?

563
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:42,114
The fact that it's today?
The dinner downstairs?

564
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:43,768
How did you find me?

565
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:46,328
You were the only one
without a tail last night.

566
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:47,911
Yeah.

567
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:50,153
But how did you know to look?

568
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:53,188
He'll say anything to get out of this.

569
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,190
We caught you red-handed.

570
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:56,380
You literally have your finger
on a trigger right this second.

571
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:58,598
I don't know why you would do this,

572
00:20:58,703 --> 00:21:01,579
but I know that you would do
anything to save your own skin.

573
00:21:01,645 --> 00:21:04,587
Just like when you ran out
of that test at Quantico.

574
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,070
Alex.

575
00:21:10,392 --> 00:21:12,276
Are you kidding me right now?

576
00:21:13,298 --> 00:21:15,966
It's Simon. It has to be.

577
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:17,067
No.

578
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:18,568
I have always seen through your lies,

579
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:19,903
but this time, I'm not sure.

580
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:22,329
If you really believe it's me and not him,

581
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:24,174
then why don't I just
let go of this trigger?

582
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:26,149
- Simon, don't!
- Why not?!

583
00:21:27,446 --> 00:21:29,579
If I'm the real terrorist,
what am I waiting for?

584
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:30,847
You wouldn't.

585
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:32,115
You got what you wanted...

586
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,517
All that time at Quantico, playing me,

587
00:21:34,935 --> 00:21:36,347
setting me up.

588
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:38,255
It wasn't about my sexuality.

589
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,389
You were just trying to get close to me

590
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,324
so you could find out my weaknesses...

591
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,361
Get inside my head so you could frame me.

592
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:46,663
Well, if that was your plan, it worked.

593
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:48,955
I go down as the Grand Central bomber,

594
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,564
and you walk away.

595
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:52,030
You're insane.

596
00:21:52,109 --> 00:21:54,893
You ever want to push a button
and make it all go away?

597
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:55,566
Simon.

598
00:21:55,632 --> 00:21:58,442
Everyone you ever loved and lost,

599
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:00,543
everything that ever hurt you...

600
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:03,012
Just one button.

601
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:04,981
No more fighting.

602
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:06,582
No more regrets.

603
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,402
No more noise.

604
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,753
Blow it all up and see what happens.

605
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:11,463
Simon!

606
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:14,824
Blow it all up just so you
can get some damn quiet.

607
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:16,753
- Simon!
- You wanted them to find me.

608
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,156
That's why you brought them
here before this bomb went off.

609
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:20,858
So you better start telling the truth,

610
00:22:20,911 --> 00:22:24,671
or it is gonna get real, real quiet.

611
00:22:26,188 --> 00:22:27,758
- Three...
- Simon!

612
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:29,090
- Two...
- Vasquez: My God!

613
00:22:29,117 --> 00:22:30,940
- Simon!
- One!

614
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,409
Stop, stop! They'll kill me!

615
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:35,425
They'll kill me.

616
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,531
A week ago,
I got a call from someone.

617
00:22:40,795 --> 00:22:42,391
They disguised their voice.

618
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,598
Whoever it was had proof
that I'd falsified evidence

619
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,824
as a trial attorney in a few capital cases.

620
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:50,526
They said they'd make sure I went to jail

621
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:52,683
for the rest of my life if
I didn't do what I was told.

622
00:22:52,723 --> 00:22:56,064
They knew I'd gone to Quantico
and that I knew you, Alex.

623
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,500
You grabbed me when I
was on my way to work.

624
00:22:58,536 --> 00:23:01,637
You drugged me in that van,
took me back to Grand Central,

625
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,071
put me on that rubble...

626
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:05,507
That wasn't me. I was gone by then.

627
00:23:05,543 --> 00:23:07,209
I never thought the bomb was real.

628
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:10,412
I thought I was just setting
you up for an attempt.

629
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:12,989
I swear, I never would
have done it otherwise.

630
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:16,709
The blood of 133 people
is on your hands, Elias.

631
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:18,504
You think I don't know that?

632
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,322
After the bomb went off,
I knew it was just a matter of time

633
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,658
before I was found out,
and I felt horrible.

634
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:25,160
Alex calling you to represent her

635
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,828
must have been a dream come true, huh?

636
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,329
All that access we gave you?

637
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,864
You were in the center of it all.

638
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,566
I thought the worst was
over until yesterday,

639
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:32,834
when the terrorist called me again

640
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,802
and said I had one last task.

641
00:23:34,838 --> 00:23:37,188
And then I'd be free forever.

642
00:23:37,307 --> 00:23:39,240
I was to bring<i> that</i> trigger to this hotel

643
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:40,608
and wait for instructions.

644
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:42,109
I panicked.

645
00:23:42,145 --> 00:23:44,312
I-I mean, I didn't want to be
responsible for any more deaths.

646
00:23:44,347 --> 00:23:46,384
So why not come to us?
We could have helped you.

647
00:23:46,463 --> 00:23:47,682
Like the FBI helped<i> you?</i>

648
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,783
They'd arrest me.

649
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:50,570
Terrorist or not, I am responsible.

650
00:23:50,653 --> 00:23:51,852
And I thought of a better way.

651
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,220
Yeah, drugging and framing<i> me?</i>

652
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:55,389
Since you knew the bomber
modeled his stuff off of my work?

653
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:57,525
And given everything
you'd done in your life...

654
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,760
Instead of taking
responsibility for yourself,

655
00:23:59,796 --> 00:24:02,696
you decided my life for yours
was a pretty fair trade.

656
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,468
The FBI had enough circumstantial evidence.

657
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:07,183
I just had to point them in your direction.

658
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:09,650
So I pretended to sleep in my office,

659
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:10,871
slipped my tail.

660
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:12,130
You're despicable.

661
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:13,740
I wanted you to find Simon.

662
00:24:13,776 --> 00:24:16,653
I brought you here because I want
you to try and stop this bomb.

663
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:18,712
I had three choices... Come clean,

664
00:24:18,747 --> 00:24:20,814
carry out the second attack myself,

665
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:22,616
or frame Simon and hope to stop it.

666
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:24,818
Look, the only thing
we want to hear from you

667
00:24:24,853 --> 00:24:26,386
is where the bomb is.

668
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:27,421
I don't know.

669
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:28,522
The only thing that makes sense

670
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:29,756
is that it's in this building somewhere.

671
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:31,792
They wanted me here,
and they wanted me dead.

672
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:34,638
Please just don't let go
of that trigger, Simon.

673
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:37,297
Call Liam now.

674
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:40,333
And then Vice President
Biden is going to...

675
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:42,303
Excuse me, ma'am. We are evacuating.

676
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,842
We have a credible threat,
and we need everyone out right now.

677
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:45,939
How credible?

678
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:47,941
The bomb squad's been
on this hotel for days.

679
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:49,697
Trust me... This is not a drill. Okay?

680
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:51,966
We're moving everyone to the E.C.C.

681
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,575
Let's go.

682
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:56,649
[Indistinct conversations]

683
00:24:59,884 --> 00:25:01,968
What? Your wife lets you go into
bathrooms with ex-girlfriends?

684
00:25:02,008 --> 00:25:03,815
- She is not my wife.
- She's not?

685
00:25:03,947 --> 00:25:05,372
She's my<i> ex-wife.</i>

686
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:07,958
W-we're undercover. Okay?

687
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:09,947
You're<i> always</i> undercover.

688
00:25:10,031 --> 00:25:11,371
We're still friends.

689
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:12,519
Look, if you knew the whole story,

690
00:25:12,546 --> 00:25:14,033
it wouldn't even be an
issue with you right now.

691
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:15,901
You did not just say that
if I know the whole story...

692
00:25:15,937 --> 00:25:17,236
Alex, listen to me.

693
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:19,772
Everyone at H.Q. knows we
work well as partners, okay?

694
00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:22,041
So they assign us to an
op where we're married.

695
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:23,108
And you<i> told</i> me to leave.

696
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:24,310
I<i> never</i> told you to leave!

697
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:26,527
Well, you sure as hell
didn't ask me to stay.

698
00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:28,747
Well, I thought you were in Los Angeles.

699
00:25:28,783 --> 00:25:31,250
If I knew you were 30
minutes away, I would have...

700
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,387
You would have what?

701
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:34,887
Then you would have asked me to stay?

702
00:25:35,265 --> 00:25:36,555
Alex, you don't know what to do with me

703
00:25:36,591 --> 00:25:38,378
when I'm 2 feet away.

704
00:25:38,484 --> 00:25:39,992
[Knocking on door]

705
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:45,498
[Knocking on door]

706
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,074
I...

707
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:50,894
I can't be here right now.

708
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:52,715
Sorry.

709
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:58,955
You haven't been home
since that night, have you?

710
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:01,412
He can't get to me here.

711
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:04,115
You remind me of my aunt.

712
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,884
After the civil war, she was convinced

713
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,988
that the Lebanese forces
were trying to kill her.

714
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:10,677
Every siren she heard,

715
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,024
every footstep was proof
she was being hunted.

716
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:14,125
Maybe she<i> was.</i>

717
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,460
[Scoffing] Of course not.

718
00:26:15,495 --> 00:26:18,879
She just couldn't get out
of this frame of mind.

719
00:26:19,222 --> 00:26:21,834
Just like what happened
to my people after 9/11.

720
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,119
Every Arab man was targeted, questioned,

721
00:26:25,172 --> 00:26:26,768
followed, surveilled.

722
00:26:26,847 --> 00:26:28,653
They saw us not as humans,

723
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:33,177
but as this hand of a
monster that hated America.

724
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:36,113
I saw people in my community act out

725
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:38,494
in ways they never would have

726
00:26:38,574 --> 00:26:41,098
if they hadn't been treated so unjustly.

727
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,658
Whatever you imagine
people might have done,

728
00:26:43,724 --> 00:26:45,623
just don't lose faith in their humanity,

729
00:26:45,676 --> 00:26:47,246
because when you do,

730
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:49,924
that's when you make the monster.

731
00:26:50,896 --> 00:26:53,803
Is it possible you could
be wrong about Charlie?

732
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,135
I know who he is.

733
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,204
And my worst fear is that someday,

734
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,528
everyone else will, too.

735
00:27:03,857 --> 00:27:05,691
Happy New Year, Nimah.

736
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:09,379
Happy New Year.

737
00:27:09,998 --> 00:27:11,181
Claire: Please... join me.

738
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:13,650
I just needed a moment to myself.

739
00:27:15,287 --> 00:27:17,054
Did you know you wanted to go into politics

740
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:19,122
when you were at the FBI?

741
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:21,758
I like to say that I was
called to public service,

742
00:27:21,794 --> 00:27:23,309
but that's not true.

743
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:25,248
I saw what passed for leadership...

744
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,263
Men telling people to do one thing

745
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:28,965
while they do the opposite.

746
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,514
Women lead by example.

747
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:32,702
We have to.

748
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:34,804
They shine a brighter light on us.

749
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,806
I know that sounds like a stump speech.

750
00:27:36,841 --> 00:27:39,075
Caleb says I'm always
running for something.

751
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,109
But it's true.

752
00:27:40,145 --> 00:27:41,577
[Chuckles]

753
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,580
He's a good son.

754
00:27:43,751 --> 00:27:45,664
He'll be a good man, I think.

755
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:48,851
Should I be afraid of him?

756
00:27:49,687 --> 00:27:51,587
I really love him.

757
00:27:51,877 --> 00:27:54,691
But your husband told me some things.

758
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:57,727
You shouldn't be afraid of him.

759
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:00,196
You should be afraid of
what people can do to him.

760
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:02,762
My son has a...

761
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,951
A good heart.

762
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:07,903
The kind people take advantage of.

763
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:10,806
I've had to distance myself
from some things that he's done,

764
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:12,808
but only because I know
they weren't really him.

765
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:16,462
They were... people using him to get at us.

766
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,314
The cult?

767
00:28:18,836 --> 00:28:22,117
It caused a lot of pain for our family.

768
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,470
Clayton and I disagreed
over how to handle it.

769
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:26,628
He wanted to catch the cult red-handed

770
00:28:26,668 --> 00:28:30,025
instead of extracting Caleb
before it went that far.

771
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:34,438
He made his choice, and I had to follow.

772
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:37,182
It cost Caleb's faith in me.

773
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,710
And my faith in my husband.

774
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:42,927
Until now.

775
00:28:43,073 --> 00:28:45,307
Now we're trying again. [Chuckles]

776
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:47,676
[Clears throat] My goodness.

777
00:28:47,711 --> 00:28:49,945
You came out here to
make a good impression,

778
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,814
and I have turned you into my therapist.

779
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:53,882
[Laughing] No.

780
00:28:53,951 --> 00:28:56,127
Amanda: Claire? It's time.

781
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,053
Be right there.

782
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,246
Your mother wants pictures of
all of you in front of the tree.

783
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,832
[Laughs] You'd think that
she's running for president.

784
00:29:03,885 --> 00:29:05,204
Oh, another eight years,

785
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,188
but for now, we'll settle for V.P.

786
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:09,096
What... is she on the short list?

787
00:29:09,132 --> 00:29:11,566
Did you think this was just an open house?

788
00:29:11,601 --> 00:29:13,401
Does my dad know?

789
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:15,469
Your father is about to become the husband

790
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:17,371
of the most powerful woman in America,

791
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:19,907
so I think he's gonna be okay.

792
00:29:21,778 --> 00:29:23,744
Miranda: All clear.
There are no bombs here.

793
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,012
He needs to give us some more information.

794
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:26,847
We're running out of places to search.

795
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:28,249
I know you know where it is.

796
00:29:28,284 --> 00:29:29,517
I don't. I swear.

797
00:29:29,552 --> 00:29:30,918
Simon, think.

798
00:29:30,954 --> 00:29:32,253
Where could it be?

799
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,454
I remember when I saw the plans

800
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:34,989
for the train stations in New York,

801
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:36,824
the tanks that fuel the backup generators

802
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,359
at Grand Central are here.

803
00:29:38,394 --> 00:29:39,460
They're under this building.

804
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:40,825
The dogs have been all

I keep thinking about
that braided copper wire.

Why use that instead of the

Braided copper... It's non-corrosive.

extreme temperatures...

what else is down here.

that the only reason that she said yes

is because she's approved
for the short list for V.P.
