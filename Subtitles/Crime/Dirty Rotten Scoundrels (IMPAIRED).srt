1
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,200
<i>(woman)</i> Your Highness, please allow
me to make this little contribution.

2
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,700
<i>(man)</i> No, I cannot accept it.

3
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,300
But think of what these
could do for your cause.

4
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,000
Even though I know they would mean
freedom for many of my people...

5
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,600
...I will not take them.
- Please. Please!

6
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,300
- These could save the lives of many men.
- The men of my country are proud.

7
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,600
They would die rather than have
their prince accept charity.

8
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,300
Then think of the lives
of the women, the mothers...

9
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,100
The women of my country
fight alongside the men.

10
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,900
They are also too proud to accept charity.

11
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,800
Then consider the lives of the children.

12
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,300
The innocent children.

13
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,000
But... for the children.

14
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,400
She's the blonde
in the blue sequinned dress.

15
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,900
Extremely rich, very married...

16
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,400
...eminently corruptible
and a willing infidel.

17
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,300
Perfect.

18
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,900
<i>(croupier) Faites vos jeux!</i>

19
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,900
<i>Rien ne va plus!</i>

20
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
<i>Sept rouge, inpair et manque!</i>

21
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,200
<i>Faites vos jeux, messieurs!</i>

22
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Monsieur Andre, would you see
what you can get for this?

23
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,600
- Not the royal ring, Your Highness?
- Sh!

24
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,900
Do you want the whole world to know?

25
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,900
Excuse me.
Is that man there truly royalty?

26
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,300
- No, madame.
- But you called him "Your Highness".

27
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
It was a faux pas. Please forget it.

28
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,900
You can trust me, I won't tell.

29
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,700
Madame, I am the police chief
of Beaumont-sur-Mer.

30
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,100
What makes you Americans
think you can buy anyone at any price?

31
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,500
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No!

32
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,000
- I've already caused the prince enough...
- Prince?

33
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,900
He sounded like he was in trouble.
Perhaps I can help.

34
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,300
If you really want to help, forget
everything that you have seen and heard.

35
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,800
Forget the very existence...

36
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,100
...of that brilliant, extraordinary man...

37
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
...of destiny.

38
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Your Highness...

39
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,600
Your Highness, don't be alarmed.
I can be trusted.

40
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,200
- Are you one of my subjects?
- No. I'm an American.

41
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Fanny Eubanks of Omaha.

42
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,600
I couldn't help overhearing.
If you're in trouble and I can help...

43
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,900
Thank you. But I cannot accept.

44
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,900
You've already risked
too much just in speaking to me.

45
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,100
I still wanna help.

46
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,400
You must understand.
I have powerful enemies.

47
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,500
They may be watching even as we...

48
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
My God, you're attractive.

49
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,000
It's late.

50
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,900
I must go.

51
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,000
- Has he left?
- Yes. Just a moment ago.

52
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,900
Good.

53
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,700
Please. You must tell me where he lives.

54
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,400
- I feel it only fair to warn you...
- I know he has powerful enemies.

55
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,400
There may also be an emotional risk.

56
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,100
You see, His Highness has
been a widower for five years.

57
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,400
For five years?

58
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
<i>(Fanny)</i> Please, Your Highness.

59
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,700
<i>("Prince")</i>
Fanny... the Freedom Fighters thank you.

60
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
This is for the overhead.

61
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,200
This goes to you, Arthur.

62
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,900
This goes to you, Andre.

63
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,900
This goes to me...
which means it's time to go to Zurich.

64
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,500
Excuse me. May I sit here, please?

65
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
- If you like.
- Thank you.

66
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,800
Good evening, sir.
Would you like to see the menu?

67
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,500
Oh, yes. I'm starving.

68
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,900
Really starving.

69
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,800
Oh! Prices.

70
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Woo!

71
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,100
I think I'll just have some water.

72
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
- Water?
- Yes.

73
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,600
Only water? But you seemed so hungry.

74
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,500
I'm saving my money
for something special.

75
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
- My mother.
- Your mother?

76
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,600
Well, she's not really my mother.
Actually, she's my grandmother.

77
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,700
But she raised me.

78
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,900
My real parents... didn't want me.

79
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,000
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- But my grandmother is wonderful.

80
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,200
She has a laugh
that can make the birds sing.

81
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,600
But she's been quite ill lately... and
the hospital bills have been adding up.

82
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,500
I just wanna do my share.

83
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,500
It's kinda tough for me because
I was never very good with money.

84
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,900
I just seem to take what the Red Cross
pays me and I give it right back to them.

85
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,800
But I am going to help my gram-gram.

86
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,300
She is the one who taught me
it is better to be truthful and good...

87
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,000
...than to not.

88
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,500
- Waiter!
- What are you doing?

89
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Waiter.

90
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,800
- Give this man whatever he wants.
- I can't let you buy me a meal!

91
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,500
Nonsense.

92
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,500
I'll have a double turkey sandwich
on white, fries, a large knockwurst...

93
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,400
...three bags of chips,
a chocolate milk and two beers.

94
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,900
Why don't you have a beer? Three beers.

95
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,500
Thank you.

96
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,200
Forgot I had a first-class ticket.

97
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,400
<i>(chuckles)</i>

98
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,400
- That bother you?
- No.

00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,900
# I love to love you in the night...

100
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,700
I couldn't help overhearing
your conversation in the dining car.

101
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,300
My condolences to your grandmother.

102
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,600
Huh?

103
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Oh!

104
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,600
Oh... right(!)

105
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,700
Didn't you say she was taken ill?

106
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,300
I tell 'em what they wanna hear
if it gets me what I want.

107
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Rather a shabby trick, isn't it?

108
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,500
I can tell you've got
a lot to learn about women.

109
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,600
Yes, I'm afraid I am a bit naive
when it comes to the weaker sex.

110
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,700
Freddy Benson.

111
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,600
- And you are?
- Lawrence Jamieson.

112
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,200
- You're married, aren't you?
- You can tell?

113
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Listen.

114
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,200
We're the weaker sex.
Men don't live as long as women.

115
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,300
We get more heart attacks,
more strokes, more prostate trouble.

116
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,100
I say it's time for a change.

117
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,100
I say let them give us money.
Let's live off them for a while.

118
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,700
That probably shocks
a guy like you, right?

119
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,600
Well, it's rather a revolutionary thought.

120
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,400
Do you really think it's possible?

121
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,500
<i>(laughs)</i>

122
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,600
Look what I did in the dining car!
She gave me 100 francs.

123
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,600
That's like, uh... 20 bucks!

124
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,800
Do you have any idea what it feels like
to take a woman for 20 bucks?

125
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,200
No, I haven't.
I'm afraid it's a little out of my class.

<i>(tuts)</i>

- It's too bad.

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,900
We could've had a blast on the Riviera.

129
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,100
- You're headed for the Riviera?
- Yeah.

130
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,000
There's a little town there, supposed
to be crawling with rich women.

Oh. And what town is that?

132
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,200
Uh... Beaumont-sur-Mer.

Beaumont-sur-Mer? <i>(laughs)</i>

I'm afraid you've been misinformed.

135
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Beaumont used to be lively, but it's been
taken over by older, retired couples.

136
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,800
- Older, retired couples? Are you sure?
- Yes, I live there.

Portofino.

of these sleepy towns really pay off.

143
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,600
Would you excuse me?
I have to phone my wife and children.

144

Yes, it is. But we're getting off, right?

158
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,600
Come and stay with me.
You can go to Portofino later.

159
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,200
I would love to, but my grandmother
is there and she's expecting me.

160
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,000
- Your grandmother is living in Portofino?
- Yes. Actually, she's quite ill.

161
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,600
Well, good luck. Give my best to your
grandmother. I hope her health improves.

162
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
<i>- Ciao.</i>
<i>- Ciao.</i>

163
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
<i>Ciao.</i>

164
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,000
Your phone call did not
give me much time.

165
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,100
Marion was perfect.

166
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,100
Make sure she gets back all right, Andre.

167
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,100
May I ask why she was necessary?

168
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,200
I needed a decoy.
This idiot was sharing my compartment.

169
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,800
He fancied himself as a bit of a player.

170
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,900
Said he was going to do
some hunting in my Beaumont-sur-Mer.

171
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,500
Monsieur Lawrence,
you can afford to dismiss such amateurs.

172
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,400
- Surely he was no match for you?
- You can't be too careful, Andre.

173
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,100
A poacher who shoots at rabbits
may scare big game away.

174
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,200
Hey, Lawrence, listen to this.

175
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,000
"A clever, young American con artist,
nicknamed The Jackal...

176
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,200
...has been working Western Europe."

177
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,300
If he's in the papers,
how clever can he be?

178
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Now, to business. Krista Knudsen.

179
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Widow of Lars Knudsen,
the Danish match king.

180
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,500
She left the Excelsior Hotel in Genoa...

181
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,700
...at 0740 hours this morning
in a white Ferrari.

182
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,800
She should be arriving at approximately...

183
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,200
Ah-hah!

184
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Here she is now.

185
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,300
<i>(woman)</i> I would like
to help your grandmother.

186
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
- I got some money here.
- <i>(Freddy)</i> Oh, no. No, I wouldn't accept it.

187
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,900
That's strange.
There's a young man with her.

188
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,400
- Please, I insist. I insist.
- I'm gonna pay you back.

189
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,200
- The poacher?
- Yes.

190
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,400
And he's no longer satisfied with rabbits.

191
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,200
Monsieur Police Inspector,
can you arrange something for me?

192
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,800
- I'm gonna pay you back, though.
- No!

193
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,700
The usual?

194
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,000
<i>Bonjour!</i>

195
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
<i>Bonjour!</i>

196
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,300
<i>Bonjour!</i>

197
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,400
Hey! Encore, encore!

198
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,800
<i>(Freddy whoops)</i>

199
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,100
Yee-ha!

200
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
# Da da-da da da

201
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
# Da-da da-da da da

202
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,100
# Da-da da-da da da daa!

203
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,400
Monsieur!

204
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,900
<i>Merci.</i>

205
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,900
Something like this, OK?
All right, here we go! Here we go!

206
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,500
OK. Two more! Two more.
How much is it?

207
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,400
Have you seen enough, Mrs Knudsen?

208
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,200
That money was to go toward
an operation for his grandmother!

209
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Here we go! Ha ha haa!

210
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,500
He's a confidence man. A trickster.
Will Madame sign the complaint?

211
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,500
Gladly.

212
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,400
I told you, I didn't steal any money
from her! She gave it to me.

213
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,700
She filed this complaint against you.

214
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,000
She caught me with another woman.
You're French, you understand that!

215
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,700
To be with another woman, that is French.

216
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,800
To be caught, that is American.

217
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,600
God! All right, what am I gonna do?
How am I gonna get out of here?

218
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,500
It's very difficult. The charge is a serious
one and you are a vagrant, an unknown.

219
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Listen, I'm not a vagrant!

220
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,100
This is my point!

221
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,700
I know somebody here.
I met him on a train. His name is...

222
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,700
His name is... James... No.

223
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,500
His name is... James Josephson.

224
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,800
Oh, no, no!

225
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,600
James Lawrence. Lawrence! Lawrence!

226
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,100
Lawrence...

227
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
Lawrence Fells. Lawrence Fings.

228
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,900
Forest Lawrenceton.

229
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,600
La... Lars. Lars!

230
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,200
Lawrence. Lawrence Lacko...

231
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,400
Lawrence...

232
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
His name is James Jessenden.

233
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,900
Lawrence Fells. Lawrence Jesterton.

234
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Lawrence Jesterton.

235
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
- Lawrence Jamieson?
- Yes!

236
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,500
Yes! Yes! We're like this!

237
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,400
Freddy. This is really very serious.

238
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,800
- They don't treat gigolos lightly in France.
- What do you mean?

239
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,900
Until 75 years ago,
they were still castrating them.

240
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,800
Don't say that word.

241
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,900
- What do they do now?
- Well, that depends who the judge is.

242
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,500
<i>- Inspecteur, qui est le juge?</i>
- <i>(chuckles)</i> Reynoux.

243
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,200
Oh. Judge Reynoux.

244
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,400
<i>(both inhale)</i>

245
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,900
- Good luck, Freddy.
- No, no. You can't go. You gotta help me.

246
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,900
- Do you have any money?
- Yeah, I got about 12... 900 dollars.

247
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,600
No, I know this chap.
He'll want at least 5,000.

248
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,500
5,000? I don't have 5,000!

249
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,400
- Can you get it?
- I have it at home.

250
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,100
- I could fly home and mail him a cheque.
- OK.

251
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,300
<i>- Inspecteur!</i>
<i>- Oui?</i>

252
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,300
<i>Est-il possible...</i>

253
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
<i>(whispering)</i>

254
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,100
<i>Non! Non, non, pas possible! Crétin!</i>

255
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,100
Freddy.

256
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,900
He says you can go... Ah-ah-ah!

257
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,100
He's got to have the rest
of the money within 48 hours...

258
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,300
...or he'll submit your name to Interpol
and you'll never travel in Europe again.

259
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,300
That's fine, that's fine.
Thank you, thank you.

260
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,900
Thank you, Lawrence Jamieson.

261
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,200
You know, I'm pretty good
at sizing people up...

262
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,200
...and I think you are one terrific guy.

263
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,000
I suppose I get pleasure
from helping people like you out.

264
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,000
- I see you know His Highness.
- Who?

265
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,000
- The prince.
- The prince?

266
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,600
I saw him shake your hand
and pat you on the back.

267
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
No kidding!

268
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,800
- And you are?
- Fanny Eubanks.

269
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,100
Fanny Eubanks? Of Omaha?

270
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,900
- Of Omaha?
- You don't have to cover up with me.

271
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,100
It may be my money
that's financing your mission.

272
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,600
You're financing my mission?

273
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,000
Perhaps His Highness has mentioned me?

274
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,300
Oh, <i>Lady</i> Fanny of Omaha?

275
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,700
He called me Lady Fanny?

276
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,900
Oh, yes. Lady Fanny of Omaha.
He speaks of you with great affection.

277
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,300
Drink, sir?

278
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
You have done a wonderful thing.

279
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,200
Sir.

280
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,700
Excuse me. I'm very sorry, sir,
but the man said it was urgent.

281
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
- What man?
- The courier, sir. He's waiting outside.

282
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,000
He said you would recognise
the secret password.

283
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,300
- What secret password?
<i>- (Freddy)</i> Lady Fanny of Omaha!

284
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,500
Hi!

285
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,100
Could you take this to the guest bedroom
and see everything is pressed?

286
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,700
Go ahead, Arthur.

287
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,300
Wow!

288
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,900
Wo-ha-ha-how! Wow!

289
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,100
All I can say is "wow"!

290
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,100
What an asshole I was
telling <i>you</i> how to take women!

291
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,800
All right. How much do you want?

292
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,600
Oh, Your Highness,
I don't want money from a man...

293
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,100
...who needs every penny
to free his enslaved people.

294
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,300
<i>(laughs)</i>

295
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,500
- What do you want?
- This!

296
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,800
This! I want this!

297
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
This is what I want.

298
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,400
I don't want money. I want you
to teach me. I'm in your hands.

299
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,500
- You can't be serious.
- Larry...

300
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,100
Lawrence.

301
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,300
All my life, I wanted to be the best at
something. I thought I was, till I met you.

302
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,600
I never realised how far
you could go with this scamming thing.

303
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,900
- You've opened my eyes!
- Freddy, this "scamming" thing...

304
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,900
...as you put it, took me years to perfect.

305
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,200
- I got time.
- Why should I help you?

306
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,700
A guy with my mouth could ruin
a lot of business around here for you.

307
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,700
What sort of an education did you have?

308
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
High school diploma.

309
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,600
And you majored in?

310
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,700
- Metal shop.
- Metal shop.

311
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,100
All right. I'll do it.

312

my money on wine you can't drink...

00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,000

00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,400
<i>(man)</i> Oh, Miss! Miss!

468
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,500
Excuse me.
Where can I get the <i>Wall Street Journal?</i>

469
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,400
I'm trying to find out the stock prices
to see how my takeover bid is going.

470
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,700
It's so hard to get
the stock prices around here.

471
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,100
<i>Au revoir!</i>

472
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,900
What are you doing here?

473
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,400
You know, that's a funny story.

474
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,600
I was at the train station, ticket in hand...

475
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,300
...and I thought "What am I leaving
this place for? I love me here!"

476
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,400
So, I'll be around a little bit more.
Lucky you.

477
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,200
Freddy. Freddy!

478
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,400
Freddy!

479
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:52,000
There simply isn't enough room
for both of us to work Beaumont-sur-Mer.

480
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,400
- You know what? I think you're scared.
- Of what?

481
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,500
Competition. You've been top dog here
for so long, you think you own the place.

482
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,700
Nice!

483
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,600
- Believe me, Freddy, I'm not afraid of you.
- Sure you are, and you should be.

484
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,100
I'm younger than you.
I'm better-looking than you.

485
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,900
I'm thinner than you. I could kick your
ass off this hill in a New York minute.

486
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,800
And I could have you arrested again.

487
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,000
And I could always call
Lady Fanny of Omaha.

488
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,600
Freddy, as a younger man...

489
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,000
...I was a sculptor,
a painter and a musician.

490
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,500
There was just one problem.

491
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,100
I wasn't very good.

492
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,700
As a matter of fact, I was dreadful.

493
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,900
I finally came to the frustrating conclusion
that I had taste and style, but not talent.

494
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,200
I knew my limitations.

495
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,100
We all have our limitations, Freddy.

496
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,500
Fortunately,
discovered that taste and style...

497
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,300
...were commodities that people desired.

498
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,000
Freddy, what I'm saying is...
know your limitations.

499
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,200
You are a moron.

500
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,600
You've been trying to get me
out of this town ever since I came here.

501
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,100
I'll tell you what. We'll make a bet.

502
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,700
If I lose, I'll leave.

503
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,900
If I win... you leave.

504
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,600
All right, Freddy, suppose we try this.

505
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,200
We find a woman, set a price...

506
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,400
...and the first man to extract
the correct amount from her wins.

507
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,100
But if you...

508
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
But if you lose,
you not only leave town graciously...

509
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,700
...you promise never to come back
to Beaumont-sur-Mer again.

510
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,900
Done. Who's the woman?

511
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,800
<i>- (woman)</i> Ooh!
<i>- (clattering)</i>

512
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
<i>(dogs yapping)</i>

513
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,500
- Charles!
- Yes, monsieur?

514
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,900
- Who is that?
- Miss Janet Colgate, monsieur.

515
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,600
Who is she?

516
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,200
I believe she is
the United States Soap Queen.

517
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,000
Thank you, Charles.

518
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,800
- OK, how much?
- She's a little young, isn't she?

519
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,300
Out of your league?

520
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,800
All right. I'll make it easy for you. $50,000.

521
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,200
$50,000?!

522
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,000
Out of <i>your</i> league?

523
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
All right. I could use $50,000.

524
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,300
First one to get 50,000 out of her.

525
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,500
May the best man win.

526
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,500
Thank you.

527
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,200
She is at the roulette table...

528
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,200
...just waiting for Your Highness.

529
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,700
And Freddy?

530
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,200
He has dropped from sight.

531
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,500
Perhaps the Jackal finally realises
he is no match for the lion, huh?

532
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,200
Keep your eyes open, Andre. He'll turn up.

533
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,000

Pardon me, miss.
Would you mind placing the bet for me?

550
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,200
It's terribly difficult
for me to reach the table.

551

Sure. What number would you like?

552
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,700
The way my luck's been running...

553
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,600
Would you pick a number for me?

554
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,800
I could use all the luck I can get.

- Your last chance for what?

563
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,600
My last chance for an operation.

Well, shouldn't the Navy
pay for your operation?

I just got word from the hospital...

568
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,200
...that she's in pretty bad shape
and if they don't operate soon...

...she might...

Why don't you just tell me what they are?

Just one stroke of bad luck after another.

574
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,200
Andre, come with me.

575
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,300
10,000 francs.

576
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,500
That's almost $2,000.

577
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,600
I don't know how to thank you.

578
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,800
But I want you to know...

579
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,700
...that you have saved the life
of a wonderful person.

580
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,900
You are a wonderful person. Thank you.

You're welcome.

582
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:09,400
Freddy... would an operation help you?

583
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
No. My problem isn't physical.

584
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,600
- It's emotional.
- Really?

585
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,600
I'm on six weeks' MTL.

586
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Mental trauma leave.

587
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,400
- What happened?
- Well...

588
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,500
...I was engaged to a girl
back in the States.

589
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,100
And we loved to dance.

590
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,900
We wanted to be professionals.
Isn't that silly?

591
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,700
And we got an opportunity
to perform on TV, on <i>Dance USA.</i>

592
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,800
And we decided that if we won,
we'd get married.

593
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,400
So, we went on and we danced,
and we won!

594
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,000
Oh, great!

595
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:00,700
And in the excitement... we got separated.

596
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,600
So I went back to the studio...

597
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,700
...and there they were...

598
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,900
...naked...

599
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,000
...dancing.

600
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,900
And then they stopped...

601
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,800
...and they made love,
right there on the dance floor.

602
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,100
Who was she with?

603
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,700
Deney Terrio, the host of <i>Dance USA.</i>

604
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,300
I'm sorry.

605
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,800
In the morning, I woke up
and my legs were useless.

606
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,200
- Numb.
- Oh, my God.

607
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,000

- Oh, yeah. There is, but...

610
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,300
What?

611
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,600
There's this psychiatrist...

...Doctor Emil Schauffhausen
of Liechtenstein.

613

Why don't you go to him?

614
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,800
A man like Schauffhausen
is in demand all over the world.

615
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,200
He gets astronomical fees.

616
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,100
It's just not something I can handle.

617

What do you mean by astronomical?

618
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,200
$50,000.

619
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,800

right now and write to Dr Schauffhausen.

624
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,900
- Oh, God! They're dancing!
- Ssh-ssh-ssh.

625
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,200
Oh, take me from this place!

626
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,300
Oh, God!

627
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,900
<i>(Freddy sobs)</i>

628
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,800
I wish you hadn't written
these things about me.

629
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:32,700
- You make me sound like a hero.
- They're true, aren't they?

630
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,300
Yes. Still, you shouldn't have
promised him the money.

631
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,500
Where am I gonna get $50,000?

632
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,600
You leave that to me, Freddy. When the
time comes, I promise you, you'll have it.

633
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,400
I'm going downstairs to mail this
letter and I'll be right back.

634
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,100
Janet.

635
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,200
Thank you.

636

Number one! Number one!
Number one! Number one!

<i>(gasps)</i>

00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,200
Hello again! <i>(laughs)</i>

643
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,400
Are you Dr Schauffhausen?

644
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,300
- Yes, Fraulein.
- What a coincidence! This is a miracle!

645
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,700
I just wrote you a letter
about someone who needs your help.

646
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:52,900
<i>(German accent)</i> Good. I look forward to
reading it when I get back to my clinic.

647
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,600
<i>- Auf Wiedersehen.</i>
- Uh, what?

648
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,600
Goodbye. <i>(laughs)</i>

649
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,400
Could I just talk to you
for a minute, right now?

650
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,900
Please. I am on my vacation.

651
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,200
But it's about an American Naval Officer,
Fred Benson.

652
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,200
You saw him.
He was next to you at the roulette table.

653
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,400
- Benson. Benson.
- In the wheelchair?

654
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,700
Is he the one who wrote me
all those letters?

655
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,100
Something about his fiancée
running off with a, uh... dancer.

656
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:30,100
That's the one!
And he's right here in the hotel.

657
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,400
I hate to disturb you while
you're on vacation, Doctor...

658
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,800
...but could I just get you
to take a look at him?

659
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,600
I'm sorry, <i>Fräu...</i> What is your name?

660
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,400
- Janet Colgate.
- Janet. Oh.

661
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:47,600
I am sorry, Janet, but if I see your friend
Benson, I have to see everyone.

662
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,700
I must draw the line somewhere.

663
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,200
- But if it's a matter of money, I...
- You haven't given him any money?

664
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,000
Just a bit.
For his grandmother's operation.

665
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,200
- Don't give him any more money.
- Why?

666
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,800
You see...

667
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,000
...his ego has taken
one shattering blow from a woman.

668
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,900
And, if he accepts charity
from a woman, that is another blow.

669
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,200
- It makes my work so much harder.
- Does that mean you'll see him?

670
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,400
- All right. I'll see him.
- That's wonderful!

671
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,300
But remember what I said.
No money for him.

672
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:33,200
If I do decide to take this case,
you must pay the fee directly to me.

673
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,200
- You understand?
- Absolutely.

674
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,900
All right.

675
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,300
Where is the boy?

676
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,600
<i>(laughter)</i>

Boy, you can really get lost
in one of these big places.

<i>(Janet laughs)</i>

I have a wonderful surprise for you.

01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,700
- What?
- Cover your eyes.

684
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
- You are a nut!
- Go on.

<i>(giggles)</i>

686
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:26,700
Now, who is the one person in this world,
outside of your grandmother...

687
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,800
...that you would like <i>most</i>
to see at this moment?

688
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:36,000
- I give up! Who?
- Dr Emil Schauffhausen!

689
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,700
At last we meet, Officer Benson.

690
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,300
After all those letters,
I feel that I know you.

691
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,900
- He can't believe it's really you!
- Yes, I think that's it.

692
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,800
I am here to help you, my boy.

693
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,300
Great!

694
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,700
Now, let's have a look
at those legs, shall we?

695
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,900
So.

696
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,600
You are numb from the waist down?

697
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,300
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.

698
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,200
Completely numb?
No feeling whatsoever?

699
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,800
- That's right.
- Mm-hm.

700
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:34,900
So you won't be feeling Mr Piggy,
then, will you?

701
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,500
No.

702
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,900
Tell me if you feel this.

703
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,500
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

704
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,600
- No.
- No?

705

<i>(Lawrence sighs)</i>

706
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,300
We must try something else.

707
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,300
Something a little more stringent.

708
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,600
Now tell me, do you feel this?

709
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,300
No.

710
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,300
How about...

711
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,500
...that?

712
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,200
- Nothing.
- Nothing, hm?

713
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,400
Watch yourself, Janet! Back a little bit.

714

01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,200
<i>(Lawrence)</i> Nothing? Hmm.

717
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,200
Any feeling there?

No?

719
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,600
This case intrigues me, Janet.

720
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,700
- I will take Officer Benson as a patient.
- Did you hear that, Freddy?

721
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:58,900
I am renting a villa here. We will move
him in, and I will really go to work on him.

722
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:03,100
Oh, thank you, Doctor. Do you really
think you can get him to walk again?

723
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,800
I will have him running,
jumping, shouting, screaming...

724
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,400
...or my name isn't
Doctor Emil Schauffhausen...

- Protector of the Veld.
- What a pleasant surprise.

732
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,800
How was your mission to Belahavula?

733
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,500
It was a great success, thanks to you.

Your Highness. Your accent.

Unfortunately, incurable.

Freddy, isn't this beautiful?
I can't believe this is really happening.

751
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:14,500
He's sacrificing his vacation and
sharing his villa. This is incredible.

Arthur, this is Miss Colgate.
She will be staying at the hotel.

753

But Officer Benson
will be staying with us.

Please don't worry.
You are close to my room.

I shall keep my eyes
on you night and day.

May I show you the villa?
It has a fascinating history.

Welcome to hell.

01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,800
This is so beautiful.

759
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,900
Janet, we haven't discussed my fee yet.

760
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,000
It will be $50,000.

761
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,500
- Yes, I'll have to call my father.
- I wish I could make it lower...

762
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:53,300
...but the clinic would never allow that.
- Oh, I understand.

Of course you would. Come on!

768
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,000
- But he can't!
- Yes, he can. It's all in his mind.

769
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,800
- It seems so cruel.
- Trust me. I'm a doctor.

770
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,300
First, I will show you the music room.

No! I just use their laundry detergent.

Well, it's not everything.
I'm keeping the mink. Is that wrong?

Besides, knowing I helped a man like
Freddy be able to live his life again...

915
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:11,100
...is worth more to me than the car
or the furniture or all the jewellery.

I really couldn't ask
for a better prize than that.

- Only by selling everything she owns.

Come on! She's keeping the mink.

If we take her for everything,
she still ends up with a very nice mink.

Freddy, the women I deal with
are carefully screened.

They're wealthy and corrupt. I never take
advantage of the poor or the virtuous.

- All right. What is the bet?

933

- A completely new bet.
- Yes, well, think of one.

First one to get her into bed.

No!

Let me tell you something, Freddy.
This is for certain.

A woman like Janet would never
give herself to a man like you.

- I know that, Freddy.
- You wanna bet?

All right, Freddy, I'll bet.
But I'm not competing to win.

Yeah, well, he did. I... couldn't sleep.

I have to talk to you, Janet.

Well, come in.

I was thinking about what
Dr Schauffhausen told me.

That I could walk again
if the desire was strong enough?

962

Yes, he told me the same thing.

963

Janet...

964
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:59,500
...I think you're the only person in
the world who can give me that desire.

Well... what do you mean?

I love you...

967

...and I think I could walk again
if I thought you loved me, too.

Oh, Freddy.

969

But... I still have this terrible fear.

970

- What fear?
- That my feelings won't be returned.

Oh, but your feelings will be returned...

01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:41,700
Yeah.

1088
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,100
<i>(laughs)</i>

1089
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:13,400
It's Andre, sir.

1090
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,200
Thank you.

1091
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:24,000
- Hello, Andre. What a lovely morning.
<i>- Monsieur Jamieson?</i>

1092
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:27,200
<i>- Are you lying down?</i>
- What?

1093
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,900
Miss Colgate was seen
returning to the hotel.

1094
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:34,700
<i>- But I took her to the plane.</i>
- Then somebody took her off.

1095
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:40,500
- Where's Freddy?
<i>- The Jackal is with Miss Colgate now.</i>

1096
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:44,400
<i>They have been together in her room,</i>
<i>with the curtains drawn.</i>

1097
01:34:45,200 --> 01:34:47,800
Oh. And for how long?

1098
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,300
Oh, not long. But long enough.
It is a disaster.

1099
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:58,900
It seems the teacher
has underestimated the student.

1100
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,200
<i>We must accept defeat graciously.</i>

1101
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,300
Now I will prepare myself for the Jackal.

1102
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,500
I'm sure he'll be over here soon
to gloat over his victory.

1103
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:11,700
Thank you, my old friend.

1104
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:18,300
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

1105
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,900
- Janet!
<i>- (sobs)</i>

1106
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Janet. What is the matter?

1107
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:53,500
I know what you said,
but I just had to see him again.

1108
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:56,500
You see, I...
I thought I was in love with him.

1109
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,700
- What?
- I went back to see him and...

1110
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,100
- And?
- And...

1111
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,600
We made love and...

1112
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,500
I tried to please him,
but how could I have known?

1113
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:18,000
And then what happened was I fell asleep,
and when I woke up, he was gone.

1114
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:24,100
He took all my money. My mink,
my jewellery, my traveller's cheques.

1115
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:27,000
Even my little change purse.

1116
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,300
What kind of a man
would do something like that?

1117
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:36,200
And do you know what else?
I'm beginning to think that he could walk.

1118
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,800
That he pretended this whole thing
just to get to me and my money.

1119
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,600
It was all my savings, the prize money.
Everything.

1120
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:46,100
$50,000!

1121
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:49,800
Janet, I told you I'd waive my fee.

1122
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,700
It had already gotten here.
I had it in my purse.

1123
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,500
What am I gonna say to my father?
Some of the money was his.

1124
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,300
Arthur!

1125
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:06,400
Yes, sir?

1126
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:10,400
I want you to phone Andre
and tell him to find Officer Benson.

1127
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:13,800
It seems he has stolen
some of Miss Colgate's property.

1128
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:16,200
I shall be at the airport.

1129
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:19,600
Janet, I am going to cover your losses.

1130
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:22,700
You and your father
will get your $50,000 back...

1131
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:25,200
...and I am putting you on the next plane.

1132
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,600
And this time,
I will make sure you are on it.

1133
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:31,000
But you're not responsible.
How could you have known?

1134
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:34,700
Any good psychiatrist would have
known he was a charlatan.

1135
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:38,300
Come. In any case, it's cheaper
than a malpractice suit...

1136
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,400
...which I am sure you would win.

1137
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:44,700
- I can't take your money.
- You can, and you will. Take it.

1138
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:57,600
Janet, come on.

1139
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:01,300
- You change planes in Paris.
- OK.

1140
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,300
I don't feel good about taking your money.

1141
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,400
I feel good about it.

1142
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:09,400
It has been so great to meet you, I...

1143
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:14,600
If you're ever in Cleveland,
will you call me?

1144
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,800
I will.

1145
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:21,800
Goodbye.

1146
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:24,300
Goodbye.

1147
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,900
Janet!

1148
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:32,500
Have a good flight.

1149
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:34,700
Thank you!

1150
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:55,700
I can't take this. It doesn't belong to me.

1151
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,700
And I'll always have something
from you that means much more!

1152
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:02,000
Bye!

1153
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:05,000
Bye!

1154
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,900
Goodbye!

1155
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,600
<i>(siren)</i>

1156
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:31,400
Monsieur Jamieson! I caught him
at the hotel, at the scene of the crime.

1157
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:33,900
What crime?
What is this guy talking about?

1158
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,500
Listen, Freddy. This time,
she really is on that plane.

1159
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:41,800
- And you can't harm her again.
- You let her go? You gotta stop her!

1160
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,700
<i>(Freddy)</i> Hey! Hey!

1161
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:48,700
Hey! Hey! Hold it! Hold it!

01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:52,000
Come back! Hey, hey, hey!

1163
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,200
Hold it!

1164
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,000
You idiot! You let her go!

1165
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:01,600
You slept with her,
but you didn't have to steal her money.

1166
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,600
Steal her money? I didn't!
She stole from me.

1167
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:08,200
I'm about to win the bet and she says
"Close the drapes." I close them.

1168
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:13,400
"Close the door." I close it. "Would you
mind taking a shower?" I took a shower.

1169
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:17,200
When I come out, she's gone. My clothes,
my wallet and my watch are gone.

1170
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,600
She even took the 2,000 francs
she gave me!

1171
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:23,500
Do you expect me to believe that when
she's returned the $50,000 I gave her?

1172
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:27,400
- What $50,000?
- The $50,000 you stole from her.

1173
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,000
I didn't steal $50,000 from her!

1174
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:45,100
Hey, there's my clothes.

1175
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,900
"Hello, boys. It was fun."

1176
01:40:56,400 --> 01:41:01,000
"I'll miss you. Love, Janet. The Jackal."

1177
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:04,600
"PS. I'm keeping the money.
Is that wrong?"

1178
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:16,200
Of all the lousy...

1179
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,500
She is disgusting!

1180
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:21,600
She is lying! She is deceitful!
She is two-faced!

1181
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,100
She is conniving and she is dishonest!

1182
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,300
Yes.

1183
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,500
Isn't she wonderful?

I'm sorry I broke your VHS player.
Give me the model number.

1186

- When I'm settled, I'll send you a cheque.
- Oh, shut up.

<i>(Freddy)</i> Well, thanks for
letting me stay the extra week.

the beginning. <i>J,</i> Janet. <i>J,</i> Jackal.

1189
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:52,400
If you think about it, it's obvious.

1190
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,400
When do you think she was onto us?

1191
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:09,400
<i>(Lawrence)</i> From the beginning, Freddy.

1192
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:12,100
She was onto us from the very beginning.

1193
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,200
She was perfect.

1194
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:25,600
<i>(Freddy)</i> So,
uh... what are you gonna do now?

1195
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:31,000
Well, things are going to be
quiet around here now.

1196
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:35,800
The season's over.

1197
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:38,100
Autumn's coming.

1198
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:41,500
I'll be shutting up part of the house.

1199

God, are you kidding me with this gravel?
These heels weren't made for this.

Hey! Hello! We made it.
Could youse get the bags up here pronto?

- Nikos, come here!
- All right, Paula.

Come on, everybody.
I want you to meet Mr Big Stuff. <i>(laughs)</i>

1214
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,600
I was showing Nikos property in Florida.

1215
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:52,400
He goes "I wanna invest
my 16 million bucks someplace new."

1216
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,500
I say "Where?"
He goes "How about Australia?"

1217
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:58,600
And then it hits me. Boom!
Australia, are you kidding me?

1218
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:03,400
We gotta go meet Mr Australia himself!
He goes "Why not?" I go "Why not?"

1219
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:07,200
- Pretty soon, the whole group goes...
<i>- (all)</i> "Why not?"

So here we are.

to meet the favourite son of Australia...

<i>(Australian accent)</i> G'day, Nikos.
How's it goin', sport? Good on ya, cobber.

1225
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:44,300
Chips O'Toole.
Hotels and oil from down under.

1226
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:48,100
Do you still have any situations
available in Sydney?

1227
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:50,000
No, it's all gone, Paula.

1228
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:53,100
Never mind, Nikos.
People drop out, don't they?

1229
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:57,400
Anyway, come on up to the house. We'll
put some shrimps on the barbie for ya.

1230
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:00,700
Hey, I almost forgot somebody!

1231
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,800
Mr Junior Partner.
The man Chips can't do without.

1232
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:08,400
The whiz kid. Randy Bentwick.

1233
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:11,500
Unfortunately, Randy is a mute.

1234
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:17,100
All right, everybody get on up
to the house for a drink.

1235
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:20,600
You wanna refresh those cocktails,
don't you?

1236
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,900
