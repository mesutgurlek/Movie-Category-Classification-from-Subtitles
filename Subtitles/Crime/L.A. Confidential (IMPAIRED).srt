SID:
Come to Los Angeles.

2
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,157
The sun shines bright,
the beaches are wide and inviting...

3
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:36,910
...and the orange groves
stretch as far as the eye can see.

4
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:41,040
There are jobs aplenty and land is cheap.

5
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,584
Every workingman
can have his own house...

6
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:48,505
...and inside every house,
a happy, all-American family.

7
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:51,717
You can have all this.
And who knows?

8
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,969
You could even be discovered...

9
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,431
...become a movie star,
or at least see one.

10
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,892
Life is good in Los Angeles.

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,728
It's paradise on Earth.

12
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,901
That's what they tell you, anyway,
because they're selling an image.

13
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,780
They're selling it through movies,
radio and television.

14
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,825
In the hit show Badge of Honor,
the L.A. cops walk on water...

15
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,453
...as they keep the city
clean of crooks.

16
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,998
Yep, you'd think this place
was the Garden of Eden.

17
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,417
But there's trouble in paradise...

18
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:29,963
...and his name is Meyer Harris Cohen,
Mickey C to his fans.

19
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:34,843
Local L.A. color to the nth degree.

...Johnny Stompanato.

22
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,557
Mickey C's the head
of organized crime in these parts.

23
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:45,771
He runs dope, rackets and prostitution.
He kills a dozen people a year...

24
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,483
...and the dapper little gent
does it in style.

25
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,611
And every time his picture's
on the front page...

26
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,823
...it's a black eye
for the image of Los Angeles.

27
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,450
Because how can organized crime exist...

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,162
...in the city with the best
police force in the world?

29
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,622
Something has to be done.

30
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,875
But nothing too original,
because, hey, this is Hollywood.

31
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,212
What worked for Al Capone
would work for the Mickster.

32
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,675
Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.
Nonpayment of federal income tax.

33
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,593
But all is not well.

34
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:20,889
Sending Mickey up has created a vacuum,
and it's only a matter of time...

35
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:25,060
...before someone
with balls of brass tries to fill it.

36

you heard it here first.

You've got a homicide downtown.

-The Nite Owl Coffee Shop.
-I got it. It's mine.

Yes, sir.

Looks like the cook drew a handgun
and set it off.

The rest were killed in the men's room.

held up a coffee shop.

Just before Christmas.

"The Nite Owl Massacre."

One of them one of our own.
Dick Stensland.

As it happens, he was a Nite Owl regular,
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Robbery is the likeIy motive.

We have rubber-glove smears
on the register...

last night in Griffith Park.

across from the Nite OwI around 1 a.m.

DMV has come up with

He doesn't want any attention.

That's right. Our motives are selfish,
so we're cooperating.

So cooperate. Why was
