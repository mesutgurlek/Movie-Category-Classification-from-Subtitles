in the house, really.

464
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,569
I bet that happens all the time.

465
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,683
This was nothing.

466
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,968
We're not happy, all right?

467
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,359
You know that I could take Danny,

468
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,079
you know that most of
your work is illegal,

469
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,959
and you know that if you tried
to divorce me, you know that...

470
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,999
I'm not saying that I would,
but I'm saying that I could,

471
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,119
and I'm saying that that is why
I don't like divorce, Irving.

472
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,559
Women do that in divorces.

473
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,650
Women get the children and then
the fathers never see them.

474
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,399
My mother never got divorced.

475
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,879
My grandmother never got divorced.

476
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,479
There are no divorces in my family.

477
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,279
I am not getting a divorce.

478
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,479
Come on, what are we doing here?

479
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,599
We fight and we fuck and that's what we do.
That's our thing.

480
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,159
<i>IRVING: She was the Picasso
of passive-aggressive karate.</i>

481
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,199
Come here. Come here.

482
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,199
<i>IRVING: She was better than any con
artist I ever met, including myself,</i>

483
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,721
<i>and she had me
like nobody had me.</i>

484
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,079
Irving, come to mama, come on.

485
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,999
<i>IRVING:
You might say she was my karma</i>

486
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,679
<i>for how I took
advantage of people.</i>

487
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,881
Irving...

488
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,879
Oh, my God.

489
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,559
Come here. Come on.

490
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,679
Get into bed.

491
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,759
All right.

492
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,679
Baby, there's such good stuff here.

493
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,199
<i>IRVING: I did not want to
leave the kid behind.</i>

494
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,925
<i>He was my son!</i>

495
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,490
<i>She had me. I was her mark.</i>

496
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,239
Now, I can't assure you that
your loan will be approved,

497
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,559
but I can tell you that
any deal I take, I close.

498
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,039
However, my fee is nonrefundable,

499
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,765
just like my time.

500
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,039
I want to thank you very
much, Irving, for seeing me.

501
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,844
I'm sorry I'm so nervous.

502
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,090
Is that...
Am I not buttoned?

503
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,569
I just got to say, Mr. Rosenfeld,
that Lady Edith was

504
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,079
very adamant that
you were top-notch.

505
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,359
That's correct.

506
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,925
I really need your help,
I'm desperate.

507
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,039
I mean, I got the Audis

508
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,159
and two boats,
and I forgot to mention

509
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,319
that I have a little piece
of real estate in Long Island.

510
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,479
SYDNEY:
No, you didn't mention that.

511
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,808
Two lunches and you
never mentioned that.

512
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,919
I was gonna mention it, then the
guy with the hat walked in.

513
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,199
The hat?
You remember that?

514
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,880
I forgot, I totally...
I do remember.

515
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,799
It was the second
time we had lunch.

516
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,119
Yes. (CHUCKLES)

517
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,799
I thought he was...
You couldn't see his eyes.

518
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,359
It was like he had no eyes.

519
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,999
Do they sell hats like that?
I don't know.

520
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,559
It's like he made it.
Where do they come from?

521
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,599
He's a great milliner.
Actually, I went to the store.

522
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,919
I saw a hat store down the street.

523
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,079
I thought maybe he bought it there,

524
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,119
and I was gonna get you one,
as, like, a memento.

525
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,079
Two lunches?
SYDNEY: Yes.

526
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,519
Really?
It's two lunches.

527
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,399
What's the big deal?
That's unusual.

528
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,439
I was trying to get him
to be more aggressive.

529
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,599
On his loan, that is.

530
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,199
You showed me a whole new side of
the city I'd never seen before.

531
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,319
Yeah, it's...

532
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,599
You're welcome.

533
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,768
No. Thank you.

534
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,999
Yeah, right.
Should I take you there?

535
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,559
Yeah, it's nice.
You liked it?

536
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,239
All right, should I
take you there twice?

537
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,805
Stop.

538
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,439
(MUTTERING) What are you doing?
What?

539
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,439
You like this guy?
Yes, I like this guy.

540
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,799
Is this messing with your judgment?

541
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,079
No, it's not
messing with my judgment.

542
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,879
Don't be stupid.
Hey, hey, hey.

543
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,999
Look at me.

544
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,645
Play your part.

545
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,319
Fine, you play your part.

546
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,959
Well, take it to
your people in London.

547
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,162
Please, take it to them.

548
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,288
I got the cashier's
check right here.

549
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,359
I give you five, and you
give me 50 back, right?

550
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,800
Please.

551
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,766
Please don't reject me.

552
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,330
Give a guy a chance.

553
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,722
Zurich?
You got an office in Zurich?

554
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,959
Paris? I can call Paris.

555
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,999
Excuse me for a second.

556
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,079
Yeah, take your time.
Excuse me.

557
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,359
Yeah. It's...
Just be one moment.

558
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,050
Do whatever you need to do.

559
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,080
(IRVING MUTTERING)
Go ahead, take your time.

560
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,161
Stick around for a little bit.

561
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,319
See my friend over here?

562
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,559
I'm not moving anywhere, all right?

563
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,399
You got the wrong office,
you're gonna be embarrassed.

564
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,599
I don't think so.

565
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,119
IRVING: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
go easy on her.

566
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,279
I may not have you, Irving,
but I have her on fraud.

567
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,959
Impersonating another individual.
On fraud?

568
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,599
On fraud? What is that?
Yeah, she may not be...

569
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,679
Identity fraud?

570
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,039
You may be from England,
but you're not royal,

571
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,359
and you have no
banking connections,

572
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,039
and that's a felony.
You don't have to cuff me up.

573
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,279
How long is that?
That's three to five years.

574
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,999
Hey, not so...
Oh, really?

575
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,519
That's interesting.
I don't even know your name.

576
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,802
Richie DiMaso, FBI.
Nice to meet you.

577
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,089
You got to get away from this guy.

see her for three days.</i>

delay her lawyer.</i>

Can we kill that, please?

583

Jesus Christ,
I put this lamp here for you

'cause I thought it
would be better for you.

585
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,079
There's a wire here, they're scared

586
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,399
because people hang themselves,

587
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,399
but I know you're
too smart for that.

588
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,959
Where's the table and chair?
There's no bed here?

589
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,439
It's like a fucking asylum.
Joe, is everybody off today?

590
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,999
Jesus Christ, it's scary.

591
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,519
Maybe I wanted to scare
you, I don't know.

592
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,759
Maybe it was my idea.

593
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,759
Maybe I'm a little
off the beaten path.

594

You know, I don't know, maybe.

Hey, you look dehydrated.

596
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,599
Here,
you want to have some tea?

597
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,529
Yeah, your lips are all chapped.

598
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,570
It's herbal.

599
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,611
It's my favorite.

600
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,479
I know you think... Look at me.

601
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,650
Hey, Edith, I know
you think Irv loves you.

602
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,529
I know you think you know him.

603
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,399
You think that he sees the world
as this cold, dark place,

604
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,479
and he cares about nobody but a
very few people on a short list.

605
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,159
His son,
his father, Rosalyn and you.

606
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,010
And you think you're
on the top of that list.

607
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,639
What if you're not? What if
you're not on that list?

608
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,161
What if you're not
even on that list at all?

609
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,319
He'd be in here right now
if he took the check,

610
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,170
but no, you did.

611
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,839
God, it's so clear to me.

612
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,639
It's so... It's clear to me,
but it's not clear to you.

613
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,039
He uses you,
Edith, to protect himself,

614
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,971
to protect his son
and his wife in Long Island.

615
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,639
No? Yes,
he put a ring on her finger.

616
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,399
He adopted her son.

617
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,919
They have a huge house,
they have two cars.

618

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,045
Okay.

775
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,804
To set this up,
to bust the con artist,

776
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,050
we need to make the honeypot
to attract the bees.

777
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,481
To attract the bees,
we need to offer them

778
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,399
a wealthy individual who
they can take advantage of.

779
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,080
Someone special, someone
new, someone amazing.

780
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,879
And those guys
are going to want to sell

781
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,399
fake bank CDs to that guy.

782
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,399
Take the sheik's money, you see?

783
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,119
Only they can't get into his
money unless they know someone,

784
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,719
and that someone is us.
Oh, that's good.

785
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,159
So, if you want
to get somebody like

786
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,359
your con artist friend, Carl Elway,

787
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,639
you get him to
want to buy or sell...

788
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,919
Keep your voice down.

789
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,439
(QUIETLY) Sell fake art or stolen art
or fake certificates of deposit,

790
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,399
he needs, who does he need?
He needs a rich sheik-guy,

791
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,679
and there you go, we can pinch him.

792
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,759
That's right, that's right,
but I don't tell Elway shit.

793
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,919
I wait for him to call me.

794
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,519
The art world is a small world,

795
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,406
and one of Elway's acquaintances
is clocking us right now.

796
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,688
Where?
Don't look. Don't look.

797
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,210
You have a good look?

798
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,325
How do you know the sheik?

799
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,648
This is my friend Al, from Queens.

800
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,650
I do aluminum siding and roofing.

801
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,891
IRVING: I want to show
you something.

802
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,164
This Rembrandt here,

803
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,649
people come from all over
the world to see this.

804
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,125
RICHIE: Yeah, he's good. Yeah.

805
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,999
It's a fake.

806
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,884
What? What are you talking about?
That's impossible.

807
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,319
People believe what
they want to believe.

808
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,879
'Cause the guy who
made this was so good

809
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,686
that it's real to everybody.

810
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,764
Now, who's the master?

811
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,407
The painter or the forger?

812
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,206
That's a fake?

813
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,529
IRVING:
That's the way the world works.

814
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,962
Not black-and-white, like you say.

815
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,204
Extremely gray.

816
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,839
Irving, could I...

817
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,319
Arthur, how many
times I got to tell you?

818
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,559
You can't meet the sheik,
all right?

819
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,639
Could I please meet him sometime?
Carl can't meet him.

820
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,959
Not yet. Another time.

821
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,999
Arthur. Hi.
Come on.

822
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,319
Edith.
Edith, hi.

823
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,439
Yes, I wanted to introduce
you to Robert Spencer.

824
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,529
We're advising the sheik together.

825
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,319
Thank you.
Robert Spencer.

826
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,124
Advisor to the sheik.
Yeah.

827
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,479
CARL:
What's this about a goddamn sheik?

828
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,759
Why are you leaving
me out of this? Huh?

829
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,559
I got to hear it from my friends?

830
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,399
It ain't for you, Carl.
What do you mean, it ain't for me?

831
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,799
Nah, it ain't for you.
What are you talking about?

832
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,519
We got to do
certificates of deposit.

833
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,679
I can print as many as you need.

834
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,079
I got my associates here.
What do you mean, guys?

835
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,839
Come on. This is not
a one-man operation.

836
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,839
Look, I can get other guys. What
are you talking about, Irving?

837
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,399
I can get other guys. You're
telling me that you can

838
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,359
get four guys to sell
fake certificates of deposit

839
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,879
to my investor
within a week?

840
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,519
Yes, I can make that happen.

841
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,959
Carl Elway can do
what he says he's going to do.

842
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,359
That's interesting, but, you know,

843
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,847
I got other guys lined up.
I got a meeting.

844
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,999
Here, look, these are my associates.
I got to run.

845
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,319
Carl, his associates are here.
CARL: Don't go.

846
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,119
He's got a meeting he's got to go to.
Listen, don't go...

847
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,719
I got to run. No, don't go...
No, don't go.

848
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,919
<i>IRVING: Crazy thing about people,</i>

849
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,599
<i>the more you say no, the more
they want in on something.</i>

850
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,719
<i>Yeah, they're so stupid.</i>

851
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,879
I got to run. Come on.

852
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,799
I'll tell them. Don't worry.
Don't worry. I'll tell...

853
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,559
Hey, you know what
Carl just told me?

854
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,559
He said he could do this whole thing
with four guys within a week.

855
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,079
Or we could do something much bigger.
All right.

856
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,559
Something bigger?
Yeah, my guy deals

857
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,799
with hundreds of
millions of dollars.

858
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,199
How much bigger?
Hundreds of...

859
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,079
I knew you were
holding out on me, Irving!

860
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,479
Hundreds of millions of dollars?
Like, much bigger.

861
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,399
Like, I'm talking about, we could
say never the fuck mind the CDs,

862
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,519
and we could have some complete
access to something huge.

863
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,839
RICHIE: Huge? Like what?

I'm advisor to the sheik.

865
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,079
CARL: Carl Elway.

866
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,919
I want you to think of
the most undervalued asset

867
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,043
in the state of New Jersey today.

868
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,006
The rebuilding of Atlantic City.

869
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,519
Look, maybe they... Maybe
they legalized gambling

870
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,679
a year ago...
Wow.

871
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,079
and nothing's happening.

872
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,759
Hey.
No licenses, no permits.

873
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,279
Quit while you're ahead, Carl.

874
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,919
I know the guy...
I know the right people

875
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,439
who are going to help you out.
Who's the guy?

876
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,359
The guy is Carmine Polito.

877
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,959
Who's Carmine Polito?

878

most quietly powerful person</i>

<i>which had become a ghetto.</i>

<i>And where he had been
mayor for ten years.</i>

886

<i>A very beloved guy.</i>

<i>A guy who never
gave up on his people.</i>

<i>His father had emigrated from
Italy and had stoked coal.</i>

CARMINE: The WPA employed craftsmen

Why can't we employ people today

900
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,479
to do work like this
in rebuilding Atlantic City?

<i>in New Jersey to create jobs.</i>

STODDARD:
You said grifters, con artists.

911
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,319
We're not going
after some politician.

912
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,239
This is a bad idea, Richard.

913
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,959
Look, it's really simple.

914
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,639
All you need is to put two
million in a Chase account...

915

What?
...under the sheik's name.

Whose $2 million?

Just listen.

$2 million under the sheik's name

Carmine calls up on the telephone,

921
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,199
calls the bank and he sees
that the sheik is real

Five days.

putting it anywhere for five days.

926

I don't care if we
control it the whole time.

00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,239
Stoddard, let us do what we need
to do to rule out corruption

928
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,439
and to get rid of the payoff guys

929
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,559
that are ruining this country.
That's my dream.

930
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,359
Don't smother it, please.
You know, Richard,

931
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,719
I understand your eagerness.

932
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,399
I really do.

933
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,199
You know I'm from Michigan,
right?

934
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,679
Let me tell you a story

935
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,839
about me and my dad and my brother.

936
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,039
We used to go ice
fishing every November.

937
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,239
Ice fishing, that's all anybody...

938
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,519
That's what we lived for.

939
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,079
Holy shit.
Just listen to me.

940
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,759
It's beautiful.
You have a little stove.

941
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,759
You huddle around,
you keep each other warm.

942
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,199
You drop a line and you just wait.

943
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,239
One year, my brother says,

944
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,599
"Let's go in October."

945
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,239
He wants to go
ice fishing in October.

946
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,159
My dad says,
"No, the ice is too thin."

947
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,079
My brother says,
I love my brother, he says...

948
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,519
I understand. Your brother
went out on the ice,

949
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,079
the ice was too thin,
he fell through the ice,

950
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,879
he went in the water
'cause he was too eager,

951
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,639
and you're saying I'm too eager.
That's what you're saying?

952
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,919
No, that's not what I'm saying.

953
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,359
What are you saying?

954
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,759
You know,
we'll finish the ice story

955
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,959
another time, young man.

956
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,119
For now, no Carmine Polito.

957
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,959
Go do your job.

958
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,399
<i>RICHIE: Stoddard shot the
whole thing down.</i>

959
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,011
Boring.

960
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,439
<i>But Edith was a genius.</i>

961
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,199
Yeah, you take me to Brenda.

962
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,919
<i>RICHIE: She somehow found this woman
who controlled the wire room.</i>

963
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,359
<i>A woman I'd never even heard of.</i>

964
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,959
She's amazing. She's in charge
of all the wire transfers.

965
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,079
<i>RICHIE: Way back in a warren
buried in the Bureau.</i>

966
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,559
She likes cats.

967
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,039
<i>This cat lady no one
ever even talked to.</i>

968
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,439
<i>And Edith met her in the ladies'
room and became friends with her.</i>

969
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,239
Brenda? Hi.

970
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,879
Hello.
How are you?

971
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,559
<i>RICHIE:
This lady handled all the wires,</i>

972
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,959
<i>and now she was
working with us.</i>

973
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,559
<i>She was excited to be
included in an operation</i>

974
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,079
<i>instead of just being
on the other end of a memo.</i>

975
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,559
You said you liked
exotic booze, so...

976
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,799
<i>It was beautiful.</i>
That's from England.

977
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,439
This is from England?
Yeah.

978
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,239
That's right. And I brought
you some tea as well.

979
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,599
Oh, thank you so much.
I mean, nobody

980
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,319
ever talks to me.
I know.

981
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,679
I mean, they just say, "Brenda,
do the clerical wiring stuff

982
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,279
"and don't ask questions."

983
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,799
You need to tell
Richie about your cats.

984
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,959
Oh, my cats?
He loves cats.

985
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,199
Oh, my cats?
Yeah.

986
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,359
Well, that's Harry.

987
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,599
Look at him standing up!
Isn't that sweet?

988
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,279
And that's Wendy.
She's a rascal.

989
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,359
But Barnaby, that's another story.

990
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,279
Barnaby plays the piano.

991
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,399
That's impressive.

992
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,039
<i>We got her to wire $2 million into
an FBI-controlled account at Chase.</i>

993
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,559
<i>It'd be there for five days,
and if Polito called,</i>

994
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,399
<i>he'd see that
the sheik was real.</i>

995
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,279
<i>And by the time
Stoddard caught up to us,</i>

996
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,999
<i>Edith made sure his boss
was impressed by my idea.</i>

997
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,719
<i>So, before he even
knew it was happening,</i>

998
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,559
<i>his boss was calling
to congratulate him.</i>

999
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,888
The sheik with the money
in the bank is a...

1000
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,799
<i>RICHIE: Anthony Amado. He had a major
hard-on to make a name for himself.</i>

1001
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,759
<i>I mean, this guy loved the
idea of being famous.</i>

1002
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,159
Don't be modest.

1003
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,999
<i>RICHIE: And Stoddard had to say</i>

1004
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,719
<i>it was his own idea or he'd look
stupid in front of his boss.</i>

1005
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,279
You made me accept praise
from my boss for thanking me

1006
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,879
for something that
never should have happened,

1007
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,479
something that I didn't approve.

1008
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,199
You should be happy.

1009
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,319
There's imaginative things
happening in this office.

1010
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,639
All right? We're not
just working in a box.

1011
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,999
<i>RICHIE: We got the $2 million to put
Carmine and the sheik together.</i>

1012
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,279
Punk.

1013
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,559
<i>I liked being on
this side of the line.</i>

1014
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,399
<i>But someone had been left out.</i>

1015
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,399
IRVING: We succeeded because
we stayed small.

1016
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,079
I got you Carl Elway.

1017
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,119
He bought stolen art,
sold fake bank CD's.

1018
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,759
That's enough.
That's one.

1019
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,919
I get you three more, no politicians.

1020
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,399
You're going to do this

1021
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,759
because you got no choice,
you work for me.

1022
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,479
Now, you keep changing the rules.

1023
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,799
You know, you're getting
a little power-drunk, Richard.

1024
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,679
You want to tell him, Edith?
You want to wake him up?

1025
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,599
Oh, no. I said we shouldn't
do any of it, Irving,

1026
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,919
you know I said that,
so now I support Richie.

1027
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,039
He's got vision.
Do it heavy or don't do it.

1028
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,519
Wait. What does that mean?

1029
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,079
I mean, he's the one
ruining America, not me.

1030
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,759
How the fuck am I ruining America?

1031
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,319
Because people just got over
Watergate and Vietnam, all right,

1032
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,679
and you're going to shit all
over politicians again?

1033
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,839
And just because you want to be
a big shot, get a promotion.

1034
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,919
No. I'm thinking big, all right?

1035
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,359
This is going to be fantastic.

1036
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,599
We're doing video surveillance.

1037
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,279
I'm doing this from the feet up.

1038
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,719
You will never do it properly

1039
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,279
because you got too much
government attitude

1040
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,799
to be small and sleek.

1041
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,799
I'm like the fucking
Vietcong, man, all right?

1042
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,079
I'm in and I'm out.

1043
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,399
I was there the whole time.

1044
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,119
You don't know it, all right?

1045
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,279
That's the fucking
art of becoming somebody

1046
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,279
who people can pin their
beliefs and their dreams on.

1047
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,289
And you can't do it.

1048
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,119
How about a suite
at the Sheraton Hotel?

1049
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,639
For Carmine Polito

1050
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,239
and rebuilding Atlantic City...
Why not?

1051
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,479
you need a luxury hotel for the sheik.
Oh, come on.

1052
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,799
Carmine does backdoor dealings all the time.
We don't have a...

1053
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,559
We don't got
a budget for that, Irving.

1054
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,799
IRVING: You got to knock the mayor,

1055
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,479
the speaker of the State Assembly,

1056
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,279
you got to knock him off of
his fucking feet, all right?

1057
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,879
He's got to feel like
he's out of his league.

1058
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,799
What you're offering, this deal,

1059
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,319
I mean, this is unheard of
in the state of New Jersey,

1060
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,079
maybe even the whole
fucking country, all right?

1061
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,439
A sheik with hundreds
of millions of dollars

1062
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,319
to rebuild Atlantic City,
are you fucking kidding me?

1063
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,999
That's gigantic, all right?

1064
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,159
And the mayor, he's going
to want to see cash,

1065
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,239
he's going to want to
see it in an account,

1066
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,999
he's going to want to see it
right now, and he will check.

1067
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,759
And that's why this
meeting isn't happening.

1068
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,726
Because to get millions,
you need millions.

1069
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,562
We already did it.

1070
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,479
What?

1071
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,919
We got the Bureau to park
$2 million for three days.

1072
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,248
We've got the account numbers.

1073
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,799
"We" meaning you and him?

1074
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,199
Yeah, we did it.

1075
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,879
Really?

1076
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,199
Yeah, me and that guy.

1077
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,519
RICHIE: She showed me.

1078
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,199
You showed him our thing?

1079

00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,159
the way that you
want to be treated.

Right? Didn't Jesus
say that or something?

1299
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,719
He may have.

I think Jesus said that as well.

I don't know if he
said the second one,

said the first one.

He's in the back room.

1855
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,599
It's a sign of disrespect

1856

to talk, uh, business
on the first meeting.

1857
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:34,119

It's disrespectful...

what you're talking about.

1859

You want to leave him back there in

You told him that?

2296
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:03,959
We're from New York.
You understand this.

2297
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,162
He goes ice fishing in the Midwest.

2298
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,568
That was told to you in confidence.

2299
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,411
He's an ice fishing guy.
Look at him.

2300
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,359
RICHIE: What are you doing?

2301
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:16,519
It's not you, that's not
you with the gun. Stop it.

2302
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:18,519
No, it's me, it's me.

2303
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:20,639
Don't do something you don't
know anything about, all right?

2304
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,159
Wait, wait, put that...
I'll show you who gets shot.

2305
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:23,439
Do not load that gun!

2306
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:24,799
You drop that gun!

2307
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,239
I'm not even gonna hit you.

2308
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:28,204
Don't! Don't!
Watch this, fucko.

2309
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,005
So...

2310
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:37,199
You want to use the Sherman Suite?

2311
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,243
The entire floor?
Yes.

2312
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:41,679
Oh, God.
Of the Plaza Hotel.

2313
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,239
What happened to the Mafia?
I thought you...

2314
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:44,519
Yes, no, no, no, this is
where they intersect.

2315
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:45,879
This is where
the two things intersect.

2316
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:48,599
The two worlds, the
politicians and the Mafia.

2317
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,319
Victor Tellegio's people, who
run Resorts International...

2318
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,359
Wait a minute. Victor
Tellegio showed his face?

2319
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,519
Yeah, I sat with Victor Tellegio.

2320
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,599
I hung outwith him.

2321
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:57,999
Yeah, we can get him,

2322
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,399
we can get his whole organization,

2323
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:03,039
as well as getting
any number of congressmen.

2324
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,479
I mean, that's just...

2325
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,400
That's just peeling the
first layer of the onion.

2326
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:07,926
Wow.

2327
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:10,519
How you gonna do that?

2328
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:13,039
We would get $10 million, that we...
$10 million?

2329
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,399
And that's how we just let
them know we're for real.

2330
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,519
$10 million?

2331
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:16,919
All right, so what does he
say he's gonna do for us?

2332
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:18,719
How are we trapping him?
They're gonna promise

2333
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:22,319
to build casinos, handle the
skims, do the licensing...

2334
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:25,039
And you have what? You have
him on tape saying this?

2335
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,083
You have that, right?
No.

2336
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:31,039
I want you to find a safer way to
get Victor Tellegio on a wire.

2337
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,890
No $10 million.
That's crazy.

2338
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,759
Thank you.
Right?

2339
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:37,239
Even to entrap Tellegio,
it's crazy.

2340
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:40,559
But you can have the Sherman Suite.

2341
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,439
STODDARD: No, no.
Stoddard, please.

2342
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:44,879
To go and get me some congressmen.
Oh, my God.

2343
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,239
Go get some congressmen
taking bribes.

2344
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:50,879
I want to pinch us some
congressmen, okay?

2345
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,684
You come back to me,
I'm proud of you.

And Stoddard.

2348

Good luck keeping
your job, by the way,

2349
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:01,119
and staying out of jail, and
not being killed by the Mob,

2350
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:03,448
but otherwise,
you're doing a great job.

2351
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,279
What's the end of
the ice fishing story?

2352
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,959
I'm not telling you the end
of the ice fishing story!

2353
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,159
I'm gonna call your fucking brother

2354
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,679
and find out the end.
My brother's dead!

2355
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:11,919
That's how it ends!

2356
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,359
He fell through the fucking ice!

2357
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:17,087
Not, that's not... He died a
different way, many years later.

2358
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,689
RICHIE: Listen, I know it's
awkward, and, uh,

2359
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,681
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, all right?

2360
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,599
But I think we can stick together
and, uh, still fulfill our goal.

2361
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:32,799
I mean, we got the Sherman Suite.

2362
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:33,959
Yeah, you got the whole floor?

2363
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:35,559
Got the whole floor, yeah.
Whole floor?

2364

Yeah, you okay?

01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:39,839
Yeah. You?

2367
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,279
Yeah, you know, it's all right.
Just got hit a little bit.

2368
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:44,279
My eye is a little blurry.

2369
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:46,239
I got drops at the pharmacy.

01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:47,959
Uh, you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, Irv.

2374
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,439
You can put a camera here.

2375
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:01,211
Right in here, maybe,
and we get it all on film.

2376
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:02,799
You like it?
We do.

2377
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:03,919
You know what,
give me those flowers.

2378
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,999
If we put the flower vase
here, put a camera in there,

2379
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,639
and then we can get
a clear shot of the couch

2380
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:08,879
where we can put the congressmen.

2381

That's right.
That's the idea.

was so that you could

but what do I do if Pete calls
me, what am I supposed to say?

You got to stop talking about

and your IRS and your taxes
and your conspiracies,

and all of that, you're gonna
say how you were wrong.

You were wrong about that.

2654

I'll tell Pete that I was wrong,

but you know that in real life,

I was right for
saying all that stuff

because then that spurred on the actions
that made you come up with this plan.
