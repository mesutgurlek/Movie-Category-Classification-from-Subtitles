The Pelican Brief

2
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,947
ROSENBERG:
Any signs got my name on them?

3
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,449
GARY:
Quite a few.

4
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,451
What do they say?

5
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,288
The usual.

6
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,707
"Death to Rosenberg."

7
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,792
"Retire Rosenberg."

8
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,461
"Cut off the oxygen."

9
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,965
That's my favorite.

10
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,553
Of course, you, Mr. Grantham...

11
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,681
...did pretty good by me
your last time out.

12
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,186
"Rosenberg equals the government
over business...

13
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,648
...the individual over government,
the environment over everything...

14
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,735
...and the Indians, oh,
give them whatever they want."

15
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,822
With all due respect,
that wasn't my line, that was a quote.

16
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,868
From one of your unnamed
Senior White House officials.

17
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,871
Senior White House bastard,
you should have said.

18
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,539
Got in there by...

19
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,876
...stirring up these people,
one against the other.

20
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,464
Never fails to amaze me...

21
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,384
...what a man will do
to get an oval office.

22
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,241
SNELLER:
Yes?

23
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,494
KHAMEL: Looking for Mr. Sneller.
SNELLER: Mr. Sneller?

24
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,539
KHAMEL:
Yes, Mr. Edwin F. Sneller.

25
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,447
KHAMEL: Hello.
SNELLER: Everything is in place.

26
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,701
All the money must be there
when I arrive in Zurich.

27
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,912
It will be there
if the job is finished.

28
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,707
It will be finished.

29
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,215
OPERATOR: May I help you?
KHAMEL: I'd like to order room service.

30
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,301
-What would you like?
-Coffee...

31
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,971
...scrambled eggs, whole-wheat toast
and orange juice, please.

32
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,056
OPERATOR: It'll be about 1 5 minutes.
KHAMEL: Thank you.

33
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,185
CALLAHAN: When we substitute
threat for an argument...

34
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,438
...violence for principle,
we allow our passion...

35
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,607
...to overcome our capacity for reason.

36
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:05,819
Passion and self-interest
are threats to liberty...

37
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,740
...which brings us
to Bowers against Hardwick.

38
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:14,328
A police officer entered Mr. Hardwick's
apartment to serve him a warrant...

39
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,831
...for an unpaid violation
for drinking in public.

40
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,334
They caught him with an open beer.

41
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,086
When he entered
Mr. Hardwick's bedroom...

42
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,714
...he found him in bed with a man.

43
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,091
The officer arrested Hardwick...

44
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,261
...for violating Georgia's statute
which outlaws sodomy.

45
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,097
Even though Georgia dropped the case...

46
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,976
...Hardwick challenged
the constitutionality of the statute.

47
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,603
Now, what was his claim?

48
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,941
-That it violates the right of privacy.
CALLAHAN: Why?

49
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,278
STUDENT: He's got the right to do
as he pleases in his home.

50
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:54,451
But what if he decided to sell drugs
at his home or engage in child abuse?

51
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,372
Those actions don't fit
within the right of privacy.

52
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,666
The court, beginning with Griswold...

53
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,961
...has limited the right of privacy
to actions which are intimate...

54
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:08,757
...which are deeply personal,
which allow us to control our lives...

55
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,467
...to define who we are.

56
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,637
But is that a constitutional claim?
There's no...

57
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,682
...right to define oneself
written into the Constitution.

58
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,767
It's not even in the Bill of Rights.

59
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,812
If the State of Georgia can regulate
Hardwick's sexuality...

60
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,274
...engaged in private with consenting
adults, Hardwick cannot be free.

61
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,985
The Constitution ensures
limited government.

62
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,822
If there's no right of privacy
and Georgia can enforce the statute...

63
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,200
...we sacrifice the liberty the framers
thought they'd guaranteed us.

64
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,870
The Supreme Court disagreed with you.

65
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,914
They found that the statute
did not violate the right of privacy.

66
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,332
CALLAHAN:
Why?

67
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,542
They're wrong.

68
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,945
HOST: So all three of you girls
find him irresistible. Why?

69
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,822
FEMALE CONTESTANT:
Sexual attraction.

70
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,408
HOST:
You mean he's just got it?

71
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,076
FEMALE CONTESTANT:
Does he ever!

72
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,870
HOST:
What you're saying...

73
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,707
...is that if you could clone
three of him, you'd all be happy.

74
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,835
Okay, tell us, what is your secret?

75
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,213
MALE CONTESTANT:
I'm not sure I can say on TV.

76
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,466
But what I can say is
it's a big secret.

77
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,718
A very big secret.

78
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,470
[GUNSHOTS]

79
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,889
HOST: My goodness gracious!
I can't believe my ears!

80
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,766
MALE CONTESTANT:
Hope my mom's not watching.

81
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,434
HOST:
She hopes so too!

82
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,228
MALE CONTESTANT:
Ma, I was just kidding.

83
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,147
HOST: Ladies, have you changed
your opinion about our stud?

84
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,233
You still like him?

85
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,902
FEMALE CONTESTANT:
I like big guys!

86
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,488
HOST:
I think your fan club has increased.

87
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,240
FEMALE CONTESTANT:
Everything has increased!

88
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,658
COAL:
They found Rosenberg around 1 A.M.

89
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,035
His nurse was also murdered.

90
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,122
Jensen was found two hours later
in some queer club.

91
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:54,960
Voyles called me, wildly upset.
It's hardly good for FBI's reputation.

92
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,254
COAL: He and Giminski are on the way.
PRESIDENT: Giminski?

93
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,174
COAL: Yes. The CIA should be involved,
at least for now.

94
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:05,429
You must wait two hours to address
the nation if we want an audience.

95
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,433
A coat and tie may seem a bit rehearsed.
How about a cardigan?

96
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:14,271
You want me to talk to the nation in a
time of crisis wearing a sweater?

97
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,689
Mr. President...

98
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,944
...I've already told Justice
to put together a list of nominees.

99
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:23,655
Restructuring the court
will be your legacy.

100
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:25,824
VOYLES:
Mr. President.

101
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:30,078
PRESIDENT: Mr. Voyles,
does the FBI have any suspects?

102
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,496
It's too soon.

103
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,291
We'll have ballistics
and autopsies later.

104
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:38,962
PRESIDENT: I would like to have a report
on your security and where it broke down.

105
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,673
You're assuming it broke down.

106
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:47,095
We have two dead judges, both of whom
were being protected by the FBI.

107
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,473
Bob, I'd like a straight answer.

108
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,185
Are these killings in any way
linked to the CIA...

109
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:57,523
...or to any other agency
of the United States government?

110
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,525
I'm shocked you'd think that.

111
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,818
Bob, just look into it, okay?

112
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,738
I suggest we meet back here at five.

113
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,324
Five, gentlemen.
Thank you.

114
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,251
COAL:
It's rally-around-the-leader time.

115
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,337
Your approval ratings will go
through the roof.

116
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:25,175
ANNOUNCER: That's the weather
in New Orleans. This is Tim Bellew.

117
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,136
We interrupt our program now
for a special bulletin.

118
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,515
NEWS ANCHOR: In a special address,
live from the White House...

119
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,184
...the president of the United States.

120
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,271
PRESIDENT:
My fellow Americans...

121
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:41,024
...our country has suffered
a grievous loss.

122
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:42,943
Last night...

123
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:48,282
...Supreme Court Justices
Rosenberg and Jensen...

124
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,200
...were assassinated.

125
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:56,790
These assassinations may be an
attempt to strike at the very fabric...

126
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,667
...of our government.

127
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,378
But I can assure each...

128
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,672
...and every American...

129
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:07,801
...that these dastardly acts
will not go unpunished.

130
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,763
Everything...

131
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:16,059
...is being and will be done
to bring the culprit...

132
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,062
...or culprits to justice.

133
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,732
For justice must...

134
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,193
...and shall prevail.

135
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:29,281
I wish you could have known him
when I used to clerk for him.

136
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:33,243
Last time I saw him,
only the mind was left.

137
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,579
That's why they killed him.

138
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,831
That mind was still a threat.

139
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,294
But why kill him now,
when he had so little time left?

140
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,924
Maybe they couldn't take a chance
he'd last till the elections.

141
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:49,635
So why Jensen?
This president nominated him.

142
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,513
He and Rosenberg had almost
nothing in common.

143
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,100
That's what they should look for.

144
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,603
Decisions on which they both agreed.

145
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,774
Boy, if there ever was a moment
for a drink....

146
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,363
One day at a time, right?

147
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:25,295
PRESIDENT: We're talking a conspiracy,
then who are the conspirators?

148
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:30,008
If we've let foreign terrorists in,
there'll be hell to pay politically.

149
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:34,805
The intelligence community can't be
blamed for a weakness in immigration.

150
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,808
PRESIDENT:
Denton, who are your suspects?

151
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,144
This has to be kept very quiet.

152
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,481
Of course.
This is the Oval Office.

153
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:50,863
At least 11 Underground Army members
have been in the D.C. area...

154
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:55,534
...and we suspect them in at least
1 00 bombings of abortion clinics...

155
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:58,328
...porno houses,
gay clubs all over the country.

156
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,164
COAL: The truth is,
you don't have a suspect.

157
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:05,335
Correct?

158
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,797
Watch your claws.

159
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:19,600
NEWMAN: Gray Grantham covers the
Supreme Court for the Washington Herald.

160
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,437
You actually interviewed
Justice Rosenberg...

161
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:27,232
...before he was shot on,
as it turned out, the day he died.

162
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:31,737
Did he say anything that might shed
some light on these dreadful events?

163
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:33,697
Yes. He spoke about things...

164
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:38,327
...off the record,
appropriately for a sitting justice.

165
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,371
But I think it would be appropriate
to quote him now.

166
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,417
GRANTHAM: He said, "The campaign waged
by the president was so ruthless...

167
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:49,338
...in its manipulation of the
middle-class fears of minorities...

168
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,052
...had been so exploitive and divisive
that it created a climate of distrust."

169
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:58,472
You know, that Grantham's
a man after my own heart.

170
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,768
Everyone wants to know
when you're starting classes again.

171
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,645
That includes me.

172
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:10,484
You know what they say:
Drinking makes depression worse.

173
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,905
What do they recommend for anguish?
Where've you been?

174
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:18,450
The library. I studied a printout
of the Supreme Court docket.

175
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,245
I even made a list of possible suspects.

176
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:24,748
And then threw it away
because they'd be obvious to everyone.

177
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,795
Then you looked for areas
Jensen and Rosenberg had in common.

178
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,088
Exactly.

179
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,676
Jensen generally protected the rights
of criminal defendants.

180
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,135
Some notable exceptions.

181
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,889
He wrote 3 majority opinions
protective of the environment.

182
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,267
And almost always supported
tax protestors.

183
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:48,188
So they might have been assassinated
by an insatiable tax collector?

184
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,983
As yet, I rule no one out.

185
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,653
Everyone is assuming the motive
is hatred or revenge.

186
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,281
Or an attempt to influence
the social agenda of the court.

187
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,326
What if the issue involved
old-fashioned material greed?

188
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,954
A case that involves
a great deal of money?

189
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:08,000
-Can I help you?
-I'd like to see this file, please.

190
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,043
Why?

191
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,296
It's public record, isn't it?

192
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:13,964
Semi-public.

193
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:17,509
Are you familiar with
the Freedom of Information Act?

194
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:20,846
CLERK:
This file has the pleading...

195
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:24,474
...and correspondence.
The rest is discovery and the trial.

196
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,185
DARBY: When was the trial?
CLERK: Last summer.

197
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,729
CLERK: Went on for 2 months.
DARBY: Where's the appeal?

198
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:32,816
Not perfected yet.
I think the deadline is August 1st.

199
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:04,241
CALLAHAN:
So, who done it?

200
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:09,454
You have some obscure suspect unknown
to the FBI and the CIA and...

201
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:13,083
...Secret Service
and 1 0,000 police departments?

202
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:14,585
I had one...

203
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,796
...which I have now discarded.

204
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:23,427
You skipped class, ignored me for a
week, just to throw it away?

205
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:24,928
Let me see it.

206
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:30,809
Don't laugh. It was ludicrous of me
to think I could solve it.

207
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,936
Hubris of the young, huh?

208
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:35,814
Don't knock the hubris that I love.

209
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,822
CALLAHAN:
I'm leaving tomorrow.

210
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,868
I'm going up to Rosenberg's memorial
in Washington.

211
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:55,167
I went through Rosenberg's decisions
the other night...

212
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:59,338
...and in the back of my mind
there's an idea...

213
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:02,299
...to do a book on him.

214
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:04,468
No one could do it better.

215
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,138
I started making notes...

216
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,144
...about what he meant to me:
surrogate father, mentor, you know.

217
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,485
I started to get very thirsty.

218
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,991
I deserted you this week.

219
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,160
Not the greatest timing.

220
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:33,163
You're here to study law,
not keep me sober.

221
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:37,709
It's Alice.

222
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,756
Want to come out with me for a burger?

223
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,842
DARBY:
No, thanks.

224
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:47,636
ALICE:
It might do you good to get out.

225
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,222
DARBY:
I'm fine, thanks.

226
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:51,640
ALICE: You sure?
DARBY: Yes.

227
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,853
ALICE:
Okay, bye.

228
00:24:00,566 --> 00:24:01,692
GRAY:
Hey, Sarge.

229
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,151
SARGE:
Hey, son.

230
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:06,905
Dark coffee, three sugars.

231
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,699
So how's the president?

232
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:10,659
Which one?

233
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,661
Not Coal, the real one.

234
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:14,246
Cool and mellow.

235
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:18,458
Would you believe he's all tore up
about Rosenberg?

236
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,712
And all fired up about...

237
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:23,714
...restructuring the court.

238
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:25,716
Thinks it'll make his place in history.

239
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,926
Sounds like Coal.
What'd you get me?

240
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,929
There's a short list of nominees.

241
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:35,434
The original had 20 or so names,
then they cut it to 8. I gave you 2.

242
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,561
What about the investigation?

243
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,563
I haven't heard much...

244
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,690
...but I'll keep my ears open.

245
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:44,234
-I know you will. Thanks.
-I got that.

246
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:45,777
I'll see you later.

247

249
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,996
Good day.
Good to see you.

250
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,916
Another coffee, please.

251
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,835
You read the Grantham article.

252
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:04,755
It had me running around all day.

253
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:09,468
Coal blasted the director, saying the
judges' names were leaked by the FBI.

254
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,972
The director said Coal had leaked them
himself to test the waters.

255
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,768
Coal ran the most divisive campaign
in 20 years...

256
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,478
...and the president did nothing.

257
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:24,316
I'd like to have seen your name
on this list of judges.

258
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:27,653
We all voted you
most likely to make the court.

259
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,324
These days, it's hard enough
just to make my class.

260
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:34,993
How old is she, this time?

261
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,956
Twenty-four. But she's...

262
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,624
...extremely mature.

263
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,128
At 24, she's mature.

264
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:48,131
I don't know if I believe that.
Do you have a photo?

265
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,552
No, I don't. She's not a puppy dog
or a grandchild.

266
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,303
Thank God.

267
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,849
Who killed them, Gavin?

268
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:01,144
I'm just a lawyer with the Bureau,
I'm not an agent.

269
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:04,147
But, as I recall, you have great ears.

270
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,151
To be honest, we don't have a clue.

271
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:14,074
My girlfriend wrote
a very interesting essay...

272
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:17,494
...on who might have ordered
the assassinations.

273
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:19,329
Your girlfriend has a theory?

274
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:26,086
Here, take a look at it. You'll get
a kick out of the way her mind works.

275
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:48,192
MORGAN: Is this Gray Grantham?
-Yes, it is.

276
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,946
Sorry to call at such a crazy hour.
I'm at a pay phone on my way to work.

I can't call from home or the office.

What kind of office?

279
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:00,204
I'm an attorney.

280
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,247
Private or government?

281
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:04,374
I'd rather not say.

282
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:07,961
I may know something
about Rosenberg and Jensen.

283
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,839
Are you recording this?

284
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,759
Can this call be traced?

285
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:17,346
I'm not recording it or tracing it.
I promise you.

286
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,723
I may know who killed them.

That's not your real name.

00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:36,907
I think I saw something at the office
I wasn't supposed to see.

291
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,369
Do you have a copy?

292
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,082
I need to think about this.

293
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,376
-I understand.
-I'm not thinking rationally.

294

Voyles is really intrigued by it.

Coal sweat and run for cover?

...a brief...

...written by an eager-beaver

342

It's a theory about the assassinations.

And indirectly...

344

01:00:57,616 --> 01:00:59,993
I promise you'll meet Voyles.

633
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:02,120
We'll go from there.

634
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:06,083
At noon tomorrow,
take the trolley to Riverwalk.

635
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:10,087
Wear a long sleeve shirt
and a red baseball cap.

636
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:14,258
Wait on the riverside at the bandstand
and I'll find you.

637
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:16,677
The riverside bandstand?

638
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:21,390
-How tall are you?
-5'1 0".

639
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:22,766
Your weight?

640
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:25,769
About 1 80,
but I'm planning on losing it.

641
01:01:27,271 --> 01:01:28,313
All right.

642
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:35,112
Tell me where you want to meet....

643
01:01:37,698 --> 01:01:39,533
Tell me where you want to meet...

644
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:42,995
...and within an hour
I'll come get you with 3 agents.

Mr. Sneller on line 2.

01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:28,512
SNELLER: Khamel is dead.
We don't know who did it.

649
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:30,931
-And the girl?
-She's running.

650
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:33,475
We lost her.
We'll find her.

DARBY:
There's been another murder.

652
01:05:52,202 --> 01:05:56,623
You remember my friend gave
the brief to a friend at the FBI?

653
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,627
The FBI friend was killed yesterday.

654
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:03,672
How do you know?

655
01:06:05,257 --> 01:06:07,759
I was holding his hand.
He was shot...

656
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:10,345
...in broad daylight
in a crowd.

657
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:13,515
I'm very sorry.

I'm in New York now.
When can you come?

01:06:16,852 --> 01:06:20,189
You'll have to give me
something I can confirm.

660
01:06:20,564 --> 01:06:25,402
We get crank calls from people claiming
to know who killed Rosenberg and Jensen.

661
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:27,988
Something you can confirm?

662
01:06:28,238 --> 01:06:29,239
Please.

01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:47,007
His first name?

668
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:48,342
Thomas.

669
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:50,594
Where did it happen?

670
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:54,389
In New Orleans.
I think that should be enough.

671
01:06:57,392 --> 01:06:58,435
All right.

672
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:05,108

That's right.

Got it.

01:08:02,749 --> 01:08:04,751
Did you follow my instructions?

684
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:07,171
GRAY:
Yes.

685
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:39,661
You must think I'm crazy.

686
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:42,664
Yes, I did...

687
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,877
...till I checked New Orleans.

688
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:49,296
Callahan was...

689
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:51,548
...killed exactly as you said.

690
01:08:51,924 --> 01:08:55,469
I also checked Verheek.
According to the FBI...

691
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:58,222
...they found his body 2 days ago...

692
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:00,849
...in a hotel room early in the morning.

693
01:09:02,935 --> 01:09:05,437
He'd been dead for at least 8 hours.

694
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:08,815
That can't be.

695
01:09:11,443 --> 01:09:13,320
Want to talk about the brief?

01:09:15,948 --> 01:09:18,659
Everyone I've told

I'll take my chances.

You can't, under any circumstances,
use my name...

01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:29,419
...or reveal how you got
the information.

700
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:32,965
Or publish anything until
I've left the country. Agreed?

701
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:35,425
Unless I can convince you otherwise.

702
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:36,927
You can't.

01:09:45,936 --> 01:09:47,729

01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:08,625
He spoke to Voyles...

01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:12,379
...who will leave it alone for a while.

709
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:15,883
The president asked Voyles to back off?

710
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:20,470
We thought it was just another shot
in the dark. Now I'm not sure.

711
01:10:20,971 --> 01:10:22,806
That's obstruction of justice.

712
01:10:23,056 --> 01:10:25,017
Assuming the brief turns out to be true.

713
01:10:26,268 --> 01:10:28,395
If it does, you'll be the fall guy.

The old Nixon two-step.

01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:38,989
Don't even think that name.

What's up with Grantham?

720
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:51,460
We got his car phone.
We haven't been inside the home yet.

721
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:53,587
Why not?

722
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:57,007
We almost got caught
by the cleaning lady.

723
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:03,847
Grantham knows about the brief.

724
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:06,850
He called 3 White House aides today...

725
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:09,019
...and God knows who else.

726
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:12,814
GRAY: What made you hone in
on this particular case so quickly?

727
01:11:14,358 --> 01:11:18,529
I remembered this piece
that "Frontline" did a year ago...

728
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:23,659
...about the young lawyer
who originally filed the suit.

729
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:29,873
They said he'd committed suicide,
but his family thought it was foul play.

730
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:38,298
After the assassinations,
I called his family.

731
01:11:38,549 --> 01:11:42,553
They said he had
a depressive problem years before...

732
01:11:42,803 --> 01:11:45,472
...but medication had taken care of it.

733
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:49,726
His doctor confirmed
what the family said.

734
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:54,356
They told the police
they were not convinced it was suicide.

735
01:11:57,693 --> 01:11:59,862
But the police
closed the investigation.

736
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:03,740
Exactly.

737
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,624
That's it.
That's the brief.

738
01:12:17,129 --> 01:12:18,630
Maybe we could...

739
01:12:19,131 --> 01:12:21,425
...finish up in the morning?

740
01:12:33,145 --> 01:12:35,439
I'll be up late going over my notes...

741
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:37,399
...while they're fresh in my head.

742
01:12:39,693 --> 01:12:41,028
Call me when you wake up.

743
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:46,742
Try and get some sleep.

744
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:56,919
Mr. Grantham.

745
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:03,175
I know it sounds silly, but...

746
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,137
...would you sleep on the sofa?

747
01:13:11,975 --> 01:13:13,185
No problem.

748
01:13:20,442 --> 01:13:21,568
GRAY:
Good night.

749
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:24,196
Listen....

750
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:27,616
At the risk of sounding old-fashioned...

751
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:30,911
...isn't it time I knew your real name?

752
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:34,998
Darby Shaw.

753
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:39,211
What made you pick me,
Darby Shaw?

754
01:13:42,714 --> 01:13:44,675
Callahan was a fan.

755
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:57,855
DARBY: Does the name Victor Mattiece
mean anything to you?

756
01:13:58,522 --> 01:13:59,523
GRAY:
Money.

757
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:00,732
Power.

758
01:14:01,733 --> 01:14:03,026
lnfluence.

759
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:08,991
DARBY: He's made and lost several
fortunes drilling oil in Louisiana.

760
01:14:10,492 --> 01:14:11,994
In 1 979...

761
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:16,540
...his oil company punched some holes
in Terrebonne Parish and hit oil.

762
01:14:16,832 --> 01:14:18,000
A lot of oil.

763
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,044
He needed governmental permission...

764
01:14:21,295 --> 01:14:25,507
...to dredge a channel though
the marshlands to get the oil out.

765
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:29,136
Enter Mattiece,
the great campaign contributor...

766
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,054
...and as night follows day...

767
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:34,850
...government permission
to gouge through the endangered marshes.

768
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,771
Mattiece is that close
to at least a billion dollars...

769
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:41,273
...when Green Fund...

770
01:14:41,648 --> 01:14:43,650
...an obscure environmental outfit...

771
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:48,071
...trots down to the U.S. District court
in Lafayette and files a lawsuit...

772
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:50,574
...to stop the entire operation.

773
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:54,369
Of course, Mattiece spares no expense
to win the lawsuit.

774
01:14:54,786 --> 01:14:59,166
I don't think there's a top law firm
between Houston and New Orleans...

775
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:01,210
...that he hasn't hired.

776
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:03,837
Fucking PBS!

777
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:06,882
DARBY:
By the time the Green Fund lawyers...

778
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:08,175
...all two of them...

779
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:10,344
...wade in, the joint ventures...

780
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:13,764
...limited partnerships
and corporate associations...

781
01:15:14,014 --> 01:15:17,184
...form an impenetrable maze
that makes Mattiece invisible.

782
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:20,604
Luckily for the Green Fund's lawsuit...

783
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:25,400
...the heart of the new oil reserve
is near a natural refuge for waterfowl:

784
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:30,239
Osprey, egrets, pelicans,
ducks, cranes, geese.

785
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:33,033
The pelican becomes the hero.

786
01:15:33,283 --> 01:15:37,746
After 30 years of contamination
by DDT and other pesticides...

787
01:15:38,622 --> 01:15:41,375
...the Louisiana brown pelican is
on the brink of extinction.

788
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:44,962
Green Fund seizes the bird
and enlists experts...

789
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:48,131
...from around the country
to testify on its behalf.

790
01:15:49,049 --> 01:15:53,345
It takes 7 years for the pelican suit
to go to trial in Lake Charles.

791
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:57,808
The 3-man jury, caring less
about the pelicans than jobs...

792
01:15:58,058 --> 01:16:00,143
...votes in favor of Mattiece.

793
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:05,357
But the judge rules to keep the
injunction against drilling because...

794
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:08,819
...he thinks Green Fund has proven
its point about the pelican...

795
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:13,282
...a federally-protected species,
and that it will appeal.

796
01:16:13,657 --> 01:16:14,992
GRAY:
What's the lawsuit's status?

797
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:17,870
DARBY:
From the trial level...

798
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,999
...it will be appealed to the Court
of Appeals in New Orleans in a month.

799
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:25,419
GRAY:
Any idea what the court will do?

800
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:27,379
DARBY:
It could be reversed.

801
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:32,467
Then the fun starts. If either side
is unhappy with the court...

802
01:16:32,676 --> 01:16:34,845
...they can appeal
to the Supreme Court.

803
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:39,308
GRAY: From today, how long would it take
for a decision by the Supreme Court?

804
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:42,019
DARBY:
Anywhere from 3 to 5 years.

805
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:44,146
GRAY:
Rosenberg would have died.

806
01:16:44,396 --> 01:16:48,650
DARBY: But another president could be
in the White House when he died.

807
01:16:48,901 --> 01:16:50,402
So if you're Mattiece...

808
01:16:50,694 --> 01:16:53,697
...and you don't mind killing
a couple of Supremes...

809
01:16:53,947 --> 01:16:57,659
...now's the time to kill them,
when you can predict their replacement.

810
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:59,203
GRAY:
But why Jensen?

811
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:02,664
DARBY: He shared one piece
of common ground with Rosenberg:

812
01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:04,541
Protecting the environment.

813
01:17:47,251 --> 01:17:48,752
I didn't mean to wake you.

814
01:17:57,553 --> 01:18:02,266
You said that Mattiece hired law firms
from Houston to New Orleans.

815
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:05,435
Were there any in Washington?

816
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:07,563
Maybe two.

817
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:11,400
White & Blazevich...

818
01:18:14,278 --> 01:18:16,780
...and Brim, Stearns & Somebody.

819
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,241
Great!

820
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:22,619
I got a call from a lawyer in D.C...

821
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:25,122
...who saw something
concerning Rosenberg and Jensen.

822
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:29,084
He backed out of our meeting.
I never heard from him again.

823
01:18:30,294 --> 01:18:33,422
He gave me a phony name,
but I got his picture.

824
01:18:34,131 --> 01:18:35,132
How?

825
01:18:35,591 --> 01:18:39,887
Long story. If he works at one of these
law firms, he could be our confirmation.

826
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:42,639
I hope you find him.

827
01:18:44,474 --> 01:18:46,268
Come with me to Washington.

828
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:49,813
I've had enough.

829
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,568
If you're right about Mattiece,
then there'll be a cover-up.

830
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:56,111
It'll probably work.

831
01:18:56,612 --> 01:18:57,779
How do you know?

832
01:18:58,405 --> 01:19:01,033
I called the Herald morgue last night.

833
01:19:01,617 --> 01:19:04,411
Two years ago, a reporter
did a piece...

834
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:07,915
...on "Violations of
Campaign Financing Laws."

835
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:12,336
He found out that, hidden under
a lot of other names of individuals...

836
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:17,341
...and PAC's and corporations,
Mattiece was the biggest contributor...

837
01:19:17,633 --> 01:19:18,842
...by far...

838
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:20,802
...to the president's campaign.

839
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:24,806
We ran a picture, with the article,
of the president and Mattiece.

840
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:28,018
It was taken unbeknownst to either one.

841
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:31,772
In it, the president and Mattiece are
in front of Mattiece's hunting lodge...

842
01:19:32,022 --> 01:19:34,775
...sipping on some bourbon,
having a good laugh.

843
01:19:35,025 --> 01:19:36,527
The best of pals.

844
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:39,530
The captions said:
"The President's Most Secret...

845
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:42,366
...and Generous Contributor."

846
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:47,621
Now if your brief is right
and it ever reaches the light of day...

847
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:50,457
...the president loses
any chance of reelection.

848
01:19:50,707 --> 01:19:53,377
The men around the president
won't let that happen.

849
01:19:53,627 --> 01:19:57,840
I checked with my sources.
The Bureau, Langley, the White House...

850
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:00,676
...all said the brief doesn't exist.

851
01:20:02,678 --> 01:20:07,349
You may be the only witness to the fact
there is a brief. If you disappear...

852
01:20:07,599 --> 01:20:09,101
...so does justice.

853
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:14,857
Is that what Callahan would want?

854
01:20:18,485 --> 01:20:20,904
He'd want me to see my 25th birthday.

855
01:20:22,906 --> 01:20:24,241
Darby.

856
01:20:24,658 --> 01:20:28,829
If this thing reaches as deep
and goes as high as we think it does...

857
01:20:29,079 --> 01:20:31,498
...they'll do anything
not to be exposed.

858
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,918
Where can you hide?

859
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:36,879
Go back to Washington.

860
01:20:46,638 --> 01:20:50,434
SARGE: They're all shook up
about you asking about something.

861
01:20:50,601 --> 01:20:51,602
GRAY:
I expected that.

862
01:20:51,852 --> 01:20:54,563
SARGE: It's like the Gestapo over there.
Coal clears everything.

863
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:57,191
They put me on medical leave
for 90 days.

864
01:20:57,524 --> 01:20:59,651
-What's wrong with you?
-I don't know.

865
01:20:59,943 --> 01:21:03,405
One thing I do know,
I've never seen it this bad.

866
01:21:03,655 --> 01:21:05,574
I'm worried about you, son.

867
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:11,580
Gray, it's Darby.

868
01:21:11,788 --> 01:21:14,958
When you hear this, I'll be in the air
on my way to nowhere.

869
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:19,171
Try to understand.

870
01:21:20,756 --> 01:21:22,758
KEEN:
I can't keep you on that story.

871
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:24,801
I'm sending you to Arkansas.

872
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,970
The Times, the networks...

873
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:30,849
...are there checking out the judge
they're about to nominate.

874
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:32,017
I need more time.

875
01:21:32,559 --> 01:21:33,602
For what?

876
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:38,774
You lost your White House sources,
you've lost Garcia and the girl.

877
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:40,776
Not your best week.

878
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:43,570
You can't take me off this story.

879
01:21:45,656 --> 01:21:47,074
What do you know for fact?

880
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:50,827
An unidentified guy says
he knows about the assassinations.

881
01:21:51,078 --> 01:21:55,624
He works in a law firm, you don't know
which one. He's cut off all contact.

882
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:58,001
That's not very promising.

883
01:21:58,502 --> 01:22:00,921
There's something there, I can smell it.

884
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:06,844
Evidence based on olfactory prowess is
inadmissible, in case you didn't know.

885
01:22:07,135 --> 01:22:08,428
Then there's a girl...

886
01:22:08,679 --> 01:22:11,473
...with her bird brief for which
you can't get confirmation.

887
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,641
Not yet.

888
01:22:12,808 --> 01:22:16,770
She also cut off contact, something
that's reaching epidemic proportions.

889
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:18,856
SECRETARY:
They're waiting for you upstairs.

890
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:23,485
Everything she said about
the two deaths has been confirmed.

891
01:22:23,735 --> 01:22:26,780
The FBI says Verheek was killed
in some hotel mugging.

892
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:29,032
-That's what you told me.
-That's what they told me.

893
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:32,452
And they said they knew of
no connection with the assassinations.

894
01:22:32,703 --> 01:22:35,622
GRAY: What else would they say?
KEEN: I'm interested in what they did say.

895
01:22:37,165 --> 01:22:39,251
Let's look at what I have confirmed.

896
01:22:39,877 --> 01:22:43,672
Callahan was killed.
He was a professor. They had an affair.

897
01:22:43,881 --> 01:22:46,967
Give it to the Times-Picayune.
Maybe they want some gossip.

898
01:22:47,217 --> 01:22:49,887
I also found that Callahan clerked
for Rosenberg 20 years ago.

899
01:22:50,137 --> 01:22:52,264
Life is filled with odd coincidence.

900
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:54,141
Not a coincidence if the brief--

901
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:56,685
You have no confirmation
there is a brief.

902
01:22:56,894 --> 01:22:59,229
I confirmed Verheek and Callahan
were friends.

903
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:03,734
They met here a few weeks ago,
when he must have given him the brief.

904
01:23:03,984 --> 01:23:06,486
-Supposition again.
-I've confirmed the pelican lawsuit.

905
01:23:06,737 --> 01:23:10,699
On which she has based her suppositions.
It's all just suppositions.

906
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:13,535
You know what Mattiece could do?

907
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:15,704
I know what he has done already.

908
01:23:15,913 --> 01:23:17,581
He has a bizarre history.

909
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:20,918
So do I, according to my ex-wife. It
doesn't mean that I killed the Justices.

910
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:23,253
But it means it's worth exploring.

911
01:23:25,172 --> 01:23:30,093
Go down to that crappy cabin of yours
on the weekend, hole up, retrench.

912
01:23:30,344 --> 01:23:35,057
Prove you have a way to revitalize
this story, and I might keep you on it.

913
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:40,187
But if I were you, I'd check
where to eat in Little Rock.

914
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:50,197
NARRATOR: This is the story of
a mystery that may never be solved.

915
01:23:50,572 --> 01:23:54,201
The story of a brilliant young lawyer
who loved this land...

916
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:57,955
...and wanted to fight to preserve it
from the inroads of man...

917
01:23:58,288 --> 01:23:59,790
...until his abrupt death...

918
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,959
...a few months ago.

919
01:24:03,377 --> 01:24:07,589
His body was found in a lonely cottage,
near the Louisiana bayou he loved.

920
01:24:08,048 --> 01:24:10,092
There was a bullet in his head...

921
01:24:10,342 --> 01:24:12,052
...and a gun beside him.

922
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:15,848
The coroner and police
have deemed it a suicide.

923
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:20,143
But he died sitting at a computer,
surrounded by his notes...

924
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:23,063
...for what he called
the case he was born to win.

925
01:24:23,313 --> 01:24:24,731
[DOGS BARKING]

926
01:24:24,982 --> 01:24:27,067
His friends and family ask...

927
01:24:27,317 --> 01:24:30,153
...would anyone commit suicide
in such a manner...

928
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:31,780
...at such a time?

929
01:24:33,115 --> 01:24:36,285
Tonight, Frontline explores
a young idealist's death.

930
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:27,669
Who's there?

931
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:31,006
It's Darby!

932
01:25:51,735 --> 01:25:53,195
I got your message.

933
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:59,076
If they bugged your phone,
they'd think I'd left the country.

934
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:08,210
Did you find that lawyer in D.C.?

935
01:26:08,961 --> 01:26:10,045
Not yet.

936
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:13,257
My editor wants to take me
off the story.

937
01:26:15,175 --> 01:26:16,969
I could help you find him.

938
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:21,473
How'd you find me?

939
01:26:23,392 --> 01:26:25,519
I called your editor.

940
01:26:27,229 --> 01:26:28,730
He told you?

941
01:26:31,984 --> 01:26:36,738
I told him I was your sister Mary
from out of town and couldn't find you.

942
01:26:39,783 --> 01:26:41,618
How'd you know I had a sister Mary?

943
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:45,873
You're not the only one doing research.

944
01:27:12,983 --> 01:27:15,152
PRESIDENT:
It was a beautiful service.

945
01:27:15,485 --> 01:27:18,113
REVEREND:
Thank you, Mr. President.

946
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,534
[INDlSTINCT CHATTER]

947
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:32,461
I'll have an announcement
after the weekend.

948
01:27:42,346 --> 01:27:46,016
It was the right thing to do,
no matter where the body was found.

949
01:27:54,191 --> 01:27:56,360
You can't announce
the nominations next week.

950
01:27:56,652 --> 01:27:58,779
You said they'd be vetted this weekend.

951
01:27:59,029 --> 01:28:00,781
There must be a change in plans.

952
01:28:01,031 --> 01:28:02,574
I don't understand.

953
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:04,826
The Pelican Brief.

954
01:28:06,954 --> 01:28:08,872
What about the Pelican Brief?

955
01:28:09,164 --> 01:28:11,834
I thought that was ancient history.

956
01:28:12,084 --> 01:28:15,087
We believe that Grantham's
gotten ahold of it.

957
01:28:15,838 --> 01:28:18,799
Mattiece will sue them
if they try to publish that.

958
01:28:19,049 --> 01:28:20,300
Not if it's true.

959
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,475
You think it's true?

960
01:28:29,226 --> 01:28:31,478
I know what Grantham will write:

961
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:34,022
"A man who gave
the president millions...

962
01:28:34,231 --> 01:28:37,192
...had two Supreme Court Justices killed
so the president...

963
01:28:37,401 --> 01:28:40,070
...could appoint
more reasonable judges...

964
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,489
...so his oil could be harvested."

965
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:47,578
If Voyles says you told him to back off
the case, we face an obstruction charge.

966
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:49,329
Oh, Jesus!

967
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:54,668
There's a way to handle this.

968
01:28:54,918 --> 01:28:56,211
Handle it how?

969
01:28:57,671 --> 01:29:00,132
We appoint two nature-lovers
to the court.

970
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:05,053
Good environmentalists
who'd kill Mattiece and his oil field.

971
01:29:05,512 --> 01:29:09,141
Meet with Voyles, in the presence
of the Attorney General...

972
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:12,060
...and demand an investigation
into Mattiece.

973
01:29:12,269 --> 01:29:15,022
I'll leak the brief
to every reporter in town.

974
01:29:15,272 --> 01:29:17,649
Then we ride out the storm.

975
01:29:18,233 --> 01:29:22,946
But there has to be some way to keep
this information from coming out.

976
01:29:23,197 --> 01:29:24,531
I'm working on it.

977
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:28,076
What?
How?

978
01:29:28,285 --> 01:29:29,536
Mr. President...

979
01:29:30,078 --> 01:29:31,413
...you don't want to know.

980
01:29:42,591 --> 01:29:44,384
What's this all about?

981
01:29:44,635 --> 01:29:46,470
A trip to Mt. Vernon will do you good.

982
01:29:46,762 --> 01:29:48,138
Are you losing it?

983
01:29:48,972 --> 01:29:51,934
First I order you to go to Little Rock,
you refuse to go.

984
01:29:52,184 --> 01:29:55,145
You refuse to tell me why,
then you order me...

985
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:57,314
...your boss, I might add...

986
01:29:57,606 --> 01:30:00,734
...to drop everything
and meet you at George's place.

987
01:30:01,318 --> 01:30:03,695
I thought of making you unemployed...

988
01:30:03,987 --> 01:30:05,989
...but you'd sue me for discrimination.

989
01:30:06,281 --> 01:30:07,449
She's here.

990
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:09,993
-The bird girl?
-She's here.

991
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:13,330
-You could've told me.
-Not wise.

992
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:17,084
By the way, refusing to tell me
where you could be reached...

993
01:30:17,334 --> 01:30:19,086
...didn't leave a good impression.

994
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:22,089
It's too risky to go to my apartment
or to the job.

995
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:24,758
-Where have you been?
-In a little hotel.

996
01:30:25,008 --> 01:30:27,719
This is a hell of a time
to punch notches in your belt.

997
01:30:28,011 --> 01:30:31,265
We're not in the same hotel.
She's helping me find Garcia.

998
01:30:31,515 --> 01:30:34,017
It sounds like she's in control.

999
01:30:34,309 --> 01:30:35,602
It's the only way she'd play.

1000
01:30:36,186 --> 01:30:38,146
KEEN:
So what if you can't find Garcia?

1001
01:30:38,355 --> 01:30:40,190
GRAY: We go to plan B.
KEEN: What's that?

1002
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,527
GRAY: We attack the lawyers directly.
KEEN: What if it's another firm?

1003
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:45,112
GRAY: We go to plan C.
KEEN: What's that?

1004
01:30:45,362 --> 01:30:47,531
GRAY: We didn't go that far.
KEEN: What if you do?

1005
01:30:48,031 --> 01:30:50,450
I must be able to get in touch with you.

1006
01:30:52,035 --> 01:30:56,665
I'm at the Marbury Hotel, room 833.
Don't use my name.

1007
01:30:56,999 --> 01:30:58,250
Write it down.

1008
01:31:00,377 --> 01:31:02,379
You mind getting off at the next exit?

1009
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:03,755
Why?

1010
01:31:04,339 --> 01:31:07,134
A tan car's been two cars behind us...

1011
01:31:07,467 --> 01:31:10,012
...since we got on the parkway.

1012
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:31,158
I thought it was following us.

1013
01:31:31,408 --> 01:31:32,409
Right.

1014
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:17,412
Georgetown Law School, please.

1015
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:25,212
Hurry.

1016
01:33:31,945 --> 01:33:33,780
GRAY:
Meet me by the stacks.

1017
01:33:47,794 --> 01:33:49,630
GRAY:
Someone was in my room.

1018
01:33:51,715 --> 01:33:53,634
DARBY:
Did you tell anyone where you were?

1019
01:33:53,884 --> 01:33:56,303
Smith Keen, but he'd never repeat it.

1020
01:33:56,803 --> 01:33:58,555
DARBY:
Did you tell him by phone?

1021
01:33:58,805 --> 01:33:59,932
No.
We were....

1022
01:34:01,642 --> 01:34:03,018
We were in his car.

1023
01:34:03,644 --> 01:34:05,437
CLERK 1 : Georgetown Law Center.
DARBY: Placement Office, please.

1024
01:34:05,604 --> 01:34:07,564
CLERK 1 : One moment, please.
CLERK 2: Placement Office.

1025
01:34:07,856 --> 01:34:11,151
This is Susan Johnson.
I'm a partner with White & Blazevich.

1026
01:34:11,401 --> 01:34:15,155
We're trying to reconstruct
some payroll records.

1027
01:34:15,405 --> 01:34:19,576
May I have the names of your students
that clerked here last summer?

1028
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:23,413
I'm from White & Blazevich.
You have something for me?

1029
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:28,252
Would you sign this, please?

1030
01:34:34,883 --> 01:34:37,469
-Thank you, Mr. Stevens.
-You're welcome.

1031
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:40,180
DARBY:
I'll call these five and see who's home.

1032
01:34:40,514 --> 01:34:44,560
I'll take the two with no phone number
and get their class schedules.

1033
01:34:50,774 --> 01:34:51,900
See you later.

1034
01:34:57,531 --> 01:35:00,993
I'm from the Washington Herald.
I'm looking for...

1035
01:35:01,243 --> 01:35:03,704
-...Robert Akers and Laura Kaas.
-Is there a problem?

1036
01:35:03,954 --> 01:35:05,956
No.
Just a few questions I want to ask.

1037
01:35:06,915 --> 01:35:08,500
GRAY:
Are they in class this morning?

1038
01:35:10,586 --> 01:35:12,421
One moment, please.

1039
01:35:19,636 --> 01:35:20,637
Excuse me.

1040
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:22,514
Do you have lD?

1041
01:35:24,808 --> 01:35:28,020
Could I speak to Dennis Maylor, please?

1042
01:35:29,021 --> 01:35:30,480
KElTH:
No, I'm Keith Maylor.

1043
01:35:31,064 --> 01:35:33,275
I'm sorry to bother you.

1044
01:35:38,614 --> 01:35:42,492
GRAY: Akers has Criminal Procedure,
Kaas has Administrative Law.

1045
01:35:42,743 --> 01:35:46,580
I'll try to find them. Maylor,
Reinhart and Wilson were all at home.

1046
01:35:46,830 --> 01:35:48,332
I can go to Maylor's.

1047
01:35:50,959 --> 01:35:52,002
DARBY:
Excuse me.

1048
01:35:52,294 --> 01:35:56,840
-Do you know Laura Kaas?
-She's the girl with the red backpack.

1049
01:36:02,513 --> 01:36:06,350
Do you recognize this man?
He's a lawyer at White & Blazevich.

1050
01:36:07,476 --> 01:36:09,061
GRAY:
We're down to Akers and Linney.

1051
01:36:09,436 --> 01:36:10,687
DARBY:
Linney's phone was disconnected.

1052
01:36:11,480 --> 01:36:13,065
I'll get his class schedule.

1053
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,108
I'll keep looking for Akers.

1054
01:36:15,776 --> 01:36:16,985
It's me again.

1055
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:20,489
I need the class schedule
for Edward Linney.

1056
01:36:20,697 --> 01:36:22,366
I'm sorry, Mr. Grantham.

1057
01:36:22,699 --> 01:36:27,287
A student you talked to called
White & Blazevich, who called the Dean.

1058
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:30,582
No more class schedules for reporters.

1059
01:36:41,969 --> 01:36:43,136
STUDENT:
Mr. Grantham.

1060
01:36:44,805 --> 01:36:46,098
I know Edward.

1061
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:51,103
He's dropped out of school for a while.
Personal problems.

1062
01:36:51,687 --> 01:36:52,855
Where is he?

1063
01:36:53,146 --> 01:36:55,858
His parents put him
in a private hospital.

1064
01:36:56,567 --> 01:36:58,610
He's being detoxified.

1065
01:37:00,696 --> 01:37:02,990
Look, he's a good guy.

1066
01:37:04,658 --> 01:37:06,493
Parklane Hospital.

1067
01:37:31,268 --> 01:37:32,436
Good afternoon.

1068
01:37:34,188 --> 01:37:35,647
May I see Edward Linney?

1069
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:38,609
-What room is he in?
-What's your name?

1070
01:37:38,942 --> 01:37:41,778
Gray Grantham, Washington Herald.

1071
01:37:42,362 --> 01:37:44,615
GRAY:
The law school said I could see him.

1072
01:37:45,407 --> 01:37:46,617
RECEPTlONlST:
I'm sorry they did.

1073
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:51,079
We run this hospital
and they run their law school.

1074
01:37:52,664 --> 01:37:54,082
May I see your administrator?

1075
01:37:55,709 --> 01:37:57,461
I'll see if I can find him.

1076
01:38:22,986 --> 01:38:24,404
Mr. Grantham.

1077
01:38:24,655 --> 01:38:26,281
Great architecture.

1078
01:38:26,907 --> 01:38:28,825
I'm sorry, Mr. Grantham.

1079
01:38:29,076 --> 01:38:31,787
ADMINlSTRATOR: Visitation
is only allowed on the weekend...

1080
01:38:32,246 --> 01:38:33,789
...and then only family.

1081
01:38:34,498 --> 01:38:36,625
GRAY:
When will he be discharged?

1082
01:38:36,834 --> 01:38:39,336
ADMINlSTRATOR:
I'm afraid that's confidential.

1083
01:38:40,838 --> 01:38:43,340
Perhaps when his insurance expires?

1084
01:38:45,634 --> 01:38:47,511
DARBY:
Do you recognize that man?

1085
01:38:49,346 --> 01:38:50,430
What's his name?

1086
01:38:51,932 --> 01:38:54,268
That's the point, I don't know.

1087
01:38:55,853 --> 01:38:57,521
EDWARD:
What is his name?

1088
01:39:01,441 --> 01:39:04,862
He works in the oil and gas section
on the 9th floor.

1089
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:11,702
Morgan.

1090
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:15,372
Yes. Morgan.

1091
01:39:16,248 --> 01:39:18,000
His first name's something like...

1092
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:20,502
...Charles, but that's not it.

1093
01:39:21,545 --> 01:39:24,047
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

1094
01:39:26,842 --> 01:39:28,844
When you opened the door...

1095
01:39:30,345 --> 01:39:32,055
...I thought I was hallucinating.

1096
01:39:34,057 --> 01:39:35,475
I'm sorry.

1097
01:39:36,977 --> 01:39:39,479
I'll take a hallucination like that...

1098
01:39:40,063 --> 01:39:41,398
...anytime.

1099
01:39:44,318 --> 01:39:45,569
Take care of yourself.

1100
01:39:50,532 --> 01:39:53,368
SECURlTY:
Excuse me, miss. What are you doing?

1101
01:39:54,411 --> 01:39:55,704
Visiting my brother.

1102
01:39:55,913 --> 01:39:57,331
Who is your brother?

1103
01:39:57,581 --> 01:39:58,582
Edward Linney.

1104
01:40:00,501 --> 01:40:01,793
This your sister?

1105
01:40:08,008 --> 01:40:09,092
Yes.

1106
01:40:09,885 --> 01:40:11,345
EDWARD:
Leave her alone.

1107
01:40:12,804 --> 01:40:14,806

1111
01:40:21,271 --> 01:40:25,317

1121

Have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

-You have a meeting with Mr. Morgan?
- Yes. At 5.

1123
01:42:11,548 --> 01:42:13,926
-When was your appointment?
-Two weeks ago.

1124
01:42:14,218 --> 01:42:15,719
May I ask why?

1125
01:42:16,094 --> 01:42:18,722
Obviously, I need an oil and gas lawyer.

1126
01:42:20,057 --> 01:42:21,725
Curtis Morgan is dead.

1127
01:42:24,186 --> 01:42:25,395
Why didn't anyone call me?

1128
01:42:26,188 --> 01:42:28,607
We have no record of your appointment.

What happened?

1130
01:42:31,443 --> 01:42:33,737
He was mugged a week ago.

1131
01:42:33,946 --> 01:42:36,114
Shot by street punks, we believe.

1132

Do you have some identification?

1133

He's Security.

Good evening.

1161
01:45:42,926 --> 01:45:45,429
I'm Grantham of the Herald.
This is my assistant.

1162
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:49,933
-Could we see Mrs. Morgan?
-I'm her father. She won't talk.

1163
01:45:50,601 --> 01:45:54,021
I respect her privacy.
I know she's been through an ordeal.

1164
01:45:54,938 --> 01:45:57,774
When did you people
ever respect anyone's privacy?

1165
01:45:58,984 --> 01:46:03,280
I feel that way about most reporters.
But her husband called me...

1166
01:46:04,031 --> 01:46:05,991
...3 times before he died.

1167
01:46:06,450 --> 01:46:08,827
I believe his death
wasn't accidental.

1168
01:46:10,621 --> 01:46:13,415
She doesn't want to talk.
Get the hell out of here.

I have no idea.

...unusual documents...

1180

...or papers?

1181
01:48:02,065 --> 01:48:05,402
We have a lock box at the bank
for deed and wills.

1182
01:48:06,904 --> 01:48:10,782
I looked at it last Thursday.
There was nothing unusual in it.

1183
01:48:12,743 --> 01:48:14,578
On Saturday morning...

...desk in the bedroom.

01:48:22,044 --> 01:48:24,171
I found something a bit unusual.

1187
01:48:26,423 --> 01:48:27,466
A key.

1188
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:30,844
A key to what?

1189
01:48:32,763 --> 01:48:34,473
Another lock box.

01:48:36,433 --> 01:48:37,559
Which bank?

1191
01:48:39,102 --> 01:48:40,854
Riggs Bank.

1192
01:48:44,441 --> 01:48:46,109
We've never banked there.

1193
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:49,196
And you knew nothing
about this other...

...box?

1195
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:52,950
Not until Saturday morning.

Maybe you should check it, Mrs. Morgan.

1199
01:49:04,461 --> 01:49:06,588
Could be a clue to who killed him.

1200
01:49:07,965 --> 01:49:10,592
Are you saying Curtis was killed...

1201
01:49:10,801 --> 01:49:13,846
...because he knew something
about the assassinations?

1202

That's exactly what I'm saying.

may be papers in the safe-deposit box...

about the assassinations?

I'll check it for you.

No one has to know you have the key.

They will only give it to his wife.

My partner's a woman.
She's trustworthy.

02:00:16,258 --> 02:00:19,303
The police traced the car
to a leasing agency.

1259
02:00:20,095 --> 02:00:22,639
It was rented yesterday by Grantham.

1260
02:00:25,058 --> 02:00:27,144
Have you heard from Grantham?

1261
02:00:28,187 --> 02:00:29,980
Not since yesterday.

1262
02:00:31,982 --> 02:00:33,650
I should've taken him off that story.

1263
02:00:34,651 --> 02:00:35,652
What story?

1264
02:00:38,989 --> 02:00:40,824
See what you can find.

1265
02:01:02,095 --> 02:01:03,430
Smith Keen...

1266
02:01:04,014 --> 02:01:05,682
...meet Darby Shaw.

1267
02:01:07,768 --> 02:01:09,645
So, Mr. Grantham...

1268
02:01:09,811 --> 02:01:11,688
...what the hell is going on?

1269
02:01:21,865 --> 02:01:24,826
Sweetheart, I'm down here
in the basement.

1270
02:01:26,453 --> 02:01:28,580
It's about two in the morning.

1271
02:01:31,208 --> 02:01:32,459
This is...

1272
02:01:33,335 --> 02:01:34,378
...an affidavit...

1273
02:01:37,047 --> 02:01:39,716
...concerning a memo
I found on my desk.

1274
02:01:41,176 --> 02:01:45,013
I'm going to trust you
to do with it what you will.

1275
02:01:46,056 --> 02:01:49,393
The memo's from Velmano,
he's a senior partner.

1276
02:01:52,271 --> 02:01:55,399
It was dated September 28th...

1277
02:01:56,733 --> 02:01:59,528
...addressed to Wakefield and it read:

1278
02:01:59,736 --> 02:02:02,364
"Sims, advise client
research is complete.

1279
02:02:03,073 --> 02:02:06,910
The bench will sit much softer
if the old man is retired.

1280
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:11,290
The second retirement is a bit unusual.
Jensen, of all people.

1281
02:02:12,249 --> 02:02:15,752
Advise further that the pelican
should arrive here in 4 years...

1282
02:02:16,003 --> 02:02:18,088
...assuming other factors."

1283
02:02:19,047 --> 02:02:20,382
There's no signature.

1284
02:02:21,508 --> 02:02:24,511
Then Justices Rosenberg and Jensen
were killed.

1285
02:02:27,389 --> 02:02:30,893
I firmly believe that this is
the work of Mattiece and his associates.

1286
02:02:31,226 --> 02:02:34,021
Memo doesn't mention Mattiece,
but it refers to a client.

1287
02:02:34,271 --> 02:02:36,440
Wakefield had no other clients.

1288
02:02:36,815 --> 02:02:39,318
And no client had as much to gain
from the new court.

1289
02:02:41,778 --> 02:02:46,241
I thought that I was protecting us
by not revealing what I found.

1290
02:02:47,284 --> 02:02:50,537
You'll only see this if I'm gone,
so I will have failed.

1291
02:02:52,789 --> 02:02:54,333
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1292
02:02:59,254 --> 02:03:01,089
I'll always be with you.

1293
02:03:03,342 --> 02:03:04,593
Always.

1294
02:03:07,638 --> 02:03:11,350
This is Marty Velmano. What a pleasure!
What can I do for you?

1295
02:03:12,184 --> 02:03:14,978
GRAY: We're doing a story
about Victor Mattiece...

1296
02:03:15,979 --> 02:03:20,108
...and his involvement in the deaths
of Rosenberg and Jensen.

1297
02:03:20,609 --> 02:03:25,197
Great! We'll sue you for the next 20
years. You'll be named as a defendant.

1298
02:03:25,489 --> 02:03:27,574
Oh, this will be great.

1299
02:03:27,824 --> 02:03:30,327
Victor Mattiece will own the Herald.

1300
02:03:30,577 --> 02:03:34,498
Have you heard of the Pelican Brief?
We have a copy of it.

1301
02:03:35,165 --> 02:03:39,086
We also have a copy of a memo
sent by you to Sims Wakefield...

1302
02:03:39,336 --> 02:03:43,841
...in which you suggest your client's
position would be greatly improved...

1303
02:03:44,132 --> 02:03:48,136
...by the removal of Rosenberg
and Jensen from the court.

1304
02:03:48,679 --> 02:03:51,014
I noticed you waited till five.

1305
02:03:51,223 --> 02:03:54,393
An hour earlier, we could've
run to court, stopped this.

1306
02:03:54,977 --> 02:03:56,895
You deny you wrote the memo?

1307
02:04:00,315 --> 02:04:02,317
It's a fabrication.

1308
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:05,404
You have no lawsuit, Mr. Velmano.

1309
02:04:06,196 --> 02:04:07,531
You know it.

1310
02:04:07,906 --> 02:04:09,533
You son of a bitch!

1311
02:04:12,703 --> 02:04:14,162
GRAY:
Mr. Coal?

1312
02:04:14,496 --> 02:04:17,624
GRAY: Have you read the Pelican Brief?
COAL: I have.

1313
02:04:17,916 --> 02:04:22,212
We're running a story which verifies
the facts set forth in that brief.

1314
02:04:22,504 --> 02:04:25,674
We've confirmed Mattiece
contributed over $4 million...

1315
02:04:25,924 --> 02:04:27,885
...to the president's last campaign.

1316
02:04:28,177 --> 02:04:30,512
4,200,000, all through legal channels.

1317
02:04:30,721 --> 02:04:31,805
That's right.

1318
02:04:31,972 --> 02:04:36,226
We believe the White House tried
to obstruct the FBI investigation...

1319
02:04:36,518 --> 02:04:39,188
...and we wonder
if there are any comments.

1320
02:04:39,396 --> 02:04:42,649
The White House denies
any direct or indirect involvement...

1321
02:04:42,941 --> 02:04:45,194
...in this investigation.

1322
02:04:45,903 --> 02:04:48,238
You've received some bad information.

1323
02:04:56,163 --> 02:04:58,290
Mr. Voyles, it's Grantham.

1324
02:04:59,708 --> 02:05:02,419
We're running a story
detailing a conspiracy...

1325
02:05:02,669 --> 02:05:04,922
...in the murders of
Rosenberg and Jensen.

1326
02:05:05,214 --> 02:05:09,259
We're naming Mattiece, an oil
speculator, and two of his lawyers.

1327
02:05:09,593 --> 02:05:13,472
We believe the FBI knew about Mattiece,
but didn't investigate...

1328
02:05:13,764 --> 02:05:17,267
...at the urging of the White House.
Any comments?

1329
02:06:29,464 --> 02:06:32,551
PRESIDENT: I think we'll have great
success with these people.

1330
02:06:32,843 --> 02:06:35,512
They were really very pleased...

1331
02:06:35,846 --> 02:06:38,182
...and genuinely cooperative.

1332
02:06:38,765 --> 02:06:40,017
What's up?

1333
02:07:24,102 --> 02:07:25,312
You know Gray Grantham.

1334
02:07:27,606 --> 02:07:29,525
And this is Darby Shaw.

1335
02:07:37,616 --> 02:07:40,827
So you're the little lady
who started this great brouhaha.

1336
02:07:42,371 --> 02:07:45,582
I think you have me confused
with the president's friend.

1337
02:07:46,834 --> 02:07:50,420
I have some comments,
for the record.

1338
02:07:59,388 --> 02:08:02,099
First, we got the Pelican Brief
two weeks ago...

1339
02:08:02,391 --> 02:08:05,269
...and submitted it to the White House
on the same day.

1340
02:08:05,477 --> 02:08:10,399
It was not considered high priority in
the investigation until Gavin Verheek...

1341
02:08:10,732 --> 02:08:13,777
...Special Counsel to the Director,
was found murdered.

1342
02:08:13,986 --> 02:08:17,114
Did the White House interfere
in the FBI investigation of Mattiece?

1343
02:08:18,615 --> 02:08:20,367
I'll discuss it...

1344
02:08:20,617 --> 02:08:21,910
...off the record.

1345
02:08:29,793 --> 02:08:34,464
Last Wednesday the president asked me
to ignore Victor Mattiece as a suspect.

1346
02:08:34,756 --> 02:08:36,300
In his words...

1347
02:08:36,925 --> 02:08:38,760
...he asked me to "back off."

1348
02:08:39,678 --> 02:08:41,138
I have a tape...

1349
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:44,141
...which I will allow no one to hear...

1350
02:08:44,391 --> 02:08:47,311
...unless the president
first denies this.

1351
02:08:48,145 --> 02:08:49,646
So what do you do now?

1352
02:08:50,898 --> 02:08:54,902
There'll be a grand jury by
noon tomorrow. Quick indictments.

1353
02:08:56,278 --> 02:08:58,447
And we'll find Mattiece.

1354
02:09:00,824 --> 02:09:03,785
I'd like a few minutes alone
with Ms. Shaw.

1355
02:09:04,494 --> 02:09:06,288
VOYLES: If she doesn't mind.
KEEN: It's her call.

1356
02:09:06,496 --> 02:09:08,415
I'd like Mr. Grantham to stay.

1357
02:09:29,186 --> 02:09:30,729
What's next for you?

1358
02:09:31,813 --> 02:09:34,316
Who killed the man disguised as Verheek?

1359
02:09:34,525 --> 02:09:37,319
Oh, you mean the assassin, Khamel.

1360
02:09:38,195 --> 02:09:41,198
Off the record, Khamel was killed
by a contract operative...

1361
02:09:41,490 --> 02:09:43,492
...hired independently by the CIA.

1362
02:09:44,535 --> 02:09:45,577
Rupert?

1363
02:09:45,869 --> 02:09:47,538
He probably has 20 names.

1364
02:09:47,746 --> 02:09:48,997
Why was he following her?

1365
02:09:50,207 --> 02:09:54,044
I think the brief initially
scared Giminski more than anyone.

1366
02:09:54,253 --> 02:09:55,754
And he probably...

1367
02:09:56,046 --> 02:09:57,130
...sent Rupert...

1368
02:09:57,297 --> 02:09:59,216
...to trail Darby...

1369
02:09:59,508 --> 02:10:02,719
...in part to watch,
and in part to protect.

1370
02:10:05,764 --> 02:10:09,226
We can help.
What do you want?

1371
02:10:11,687 --> 02:10:13,564
To leave the country, alone.

1372
02:10:16,733 --> 02:10:17,860
All right.

1373
02:10:18,402 --> 02:10:21,280
We'll get you out of here,
put you on my plane.

1374
02:10:21,613 --> 02:10:24,199
We'll fly you anywhere you want
and you can disappear.

1375
02:10:24,491 --> 02:10:27,077
But you must allow me to contact you...

1376
02:10:27,619 --> 02:10:28,912
...through Mr. Grantham...

1377
02:10:29,204 --> 02:10:32,708
...if, and only if,
it becomes urgently necessary.

1378
02:10:34,918 --> 02:10:36,211
That's fine.

1379
02:10:38,922 --> 02:10:42,217
I want no one on the plane but me,
Gray and the pilots.

1380
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:46,054
After takeoff, I'll tell the pilot
where to go.

1381
02:10:46,722 --> 02:10:49,933
He has to file a flight plan
before he can leave.

1382
02:10:50,642 --> 02:10:53,061
You're the director of the FBI.

1383
02:10:54,104 --> 02:10:55,522
Set it up.

1384
02:14:51,466 --> 02:14:53,468
NEWMAN:
Our guest today is Gray Grantham...

1385
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:56,680
...who has, as just about everyone
in America knows...

1386
02:14:57,055 --> 02:15:01,894
...revealed the plot behind the
assassinations of Rosenberg and Jensen.

1387
02:15:02,269 --> 02:15:05,898
The ripple effects of this story
just don't seem to stop.

1388
02:15:06,190 --> 02:15:10,319
As of this broadcast, Victor Mattiece,
one of the country's richest men...

1389
02:15:10,527 --> 02:15:13,989
...has been indicted, along with
4 aides and lawyers.

1390
02:15:14,406 --> 02:15:18,535
Fletcher Coal, the president's Chief
of Staff, has resigned.

1391
02:15:18,785 --> 02:15:22,372
And we're getting strong indications
that the president himself...

1392
02:15:22,581 --> 02:15:24,041
...will not run again.

1393
02:15:24,708 --> 02:15:27,544
That's what we know.
Let's get to what we don't.

1394
02:15:28,921 --> 02:15:33,217
We know the Pelican Brief was written
by a woman named Darby Shaw...

1395
02:15:33,425 --> 02:15:35,719
...but we don't know who that is.

1396
02:15:35,928 --> 02:15:37,930
Who is Darby Shaw?

1397
02:15:40,390 --> 02:15:43,018
GRAY:
That's a question for Darby Shaw.

1398
02:15:43,227 --> 02:15:47,856
NEWMAN: Next question.
Speaking for many of our colleagues...

1399
02:15:48,190 --> 02:15:50,901
...who are in a feeding frenzy to
interview her...

1400
02:15:51,193 --> 02:15:52,945
...where is Darby Shaw?

1401
02:15:53,237 --> 02:15:57,574
That's also a question for Darby Shaw.
But she's not available...

1402
02:15:57,866 --> 02:16:00,410
...to answer questions
until the feeding frenzy stops.

1403
02:16:01,245 --> 02:16:04,206
NEWMAN: Does that mean
you don't know where she is?

1404
02:16:05,332 --> 02:16:06,542
I didn't say that.

1405
02:16:06,834 --> 02:16:08,126
NEWMAN:
Then you do know.

1406
02:16:12,339 --> 02:16:14,591
I take it this cryptic smile means...

1407
02:16:14,842 --> 02:16:16,426
...you're not answering.

1408
02:16:18,762 --> 02:16:22,057
In view of all this, you know that...

1409
02:16:22,850 --> 02:16:24,268
...there's speculation...

1410
02:16:24,476 --> 02:16:28,105
...that this woman is a figment
of your imagination.

1411
02:16:28,397 --> 02:16:32,109
That you created her
from a lot of different sources.

1412
02:16:33,068 --> 02:16:36,363
Just as there are people who believe
there was no Deep Throat...

1413
02:16:36,613 --> 02:16:39,908
...there are those who believe
there is no Darby Shaw.

1414
02:16:40,117 --> 02:16:43,620
In other words,
she's just too good to be true.

1415
02:16:44,872 --> 02:16:46,415
She almost is.
