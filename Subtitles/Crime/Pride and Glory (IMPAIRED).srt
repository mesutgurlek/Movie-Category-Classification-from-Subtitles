We dumped it. Somebody called him
right before our guys went in.

754

on that 911 call.

755

It's the same number, Fran.

756
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,446
And you know where the call came from?
It came from Coney Island.

heard in Brooklyn?

- Tell me that.

football game, okay?

and tipped him that our guys were coming.

You're supposed to fix the leaks before you

Ears to the ground,
but they're getting blanked.

He said you came at him a little bit.

how they were operating.

could clear it up for me.

You didn't put it down in the fives?

No, I didn't put it in the fives yet.

This isn't loose ends.

00:52:31,097 --> 00:52:33,895
Pop, I got the shooter's girl saying...

817
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:37,192
Saying that he got tipped off.

818
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,634
And she says it was a cop
that made the call.

and marshmallows.

907
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,811
Do you have ice in your boot?

908
00:59:31,384 --> 00:59:34,376
Okay. There we go, baby. Whoo!

909
00:59:35,255 --> 00:59:37,815
- All right, honey, boots.
MEGAN: Okay.

910
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,920
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Oh, I'm sorry, pumpkin.

911
00:59:40,093 --> 00:59:41,424
- I'm okay.
MEGAN: Okay.

912
00:59:41,594 --> 00:59:42,583
[DOORBELL RINGING]

913
00:59:42,762 --> 00:59:46,528
Oh, who's that?
Who is that? Let's go get the door.

914
00:59:50,036 --> 00:59:51,833
What's up, guy?

915
00:59:52,472 --> 00:59:54,531
MEGAN: Hi there.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Egan.

916
00:59:54,707 --> 00:59:56,334
Is Jimmy home?

917
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,874
Yeah. I'm sorry, who are you?

918
00:59:58,044 --> 01:00:00,569
- I'm a old friend of his.
- You're an old friend of his?

919
01:00:00,747 --> 01:00:03,716
Baby, I got it. Jimmy, come here.
Come here. Get inside.

920
01:00:03,883 --> 01:00:07,319
- Get some hot chocolate. I got it.
- He's an old friend.

921
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,548
JIMMY: What the fuck you doing here,
Casado? Get around back. Now.

922
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,088
MEGAN:
Who's that, baby?

923
01:00:15,261 --> 01:00:17,229
Nobody. He's out of here in five minutes.

924
01:00:17,397 --> 01:00:20,560
- Where do you know him from?
- From work. He shouldn't be here.

925
01:00:20,733 --> 01:00:22,462
So why is he here?

926
01:00:22,902 --> 01:00:24,096
I'm gonna get rid of him.

927
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:26,500
Kiss for me? Rah!

928
01:00:27,006 --> 01:00:29,338
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too.

929
01:00:29,609 --> 01:00:31,201
You too, Mommy.

930
01:00:31,678 --> 01:00:33,543
Do you have any juice?

931
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,238
Jimmy, Franny's called you
like a thousand times today.

932
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:39,817
- You gonna call him back or what?
- Yeah, Bobby's going on vacation.

933
01:00:40,987 --> 01:00:44,184
Probably wants me to cover.
I'll talk to him tonight.

934
01:00:52,165 --> 01:00:54,429
You know how many cops
I got as neighbors, moron?

935
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,760
I figured that.

936
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,994
What got into your head,
you come to my home?

937
01:00:58,171 --> 01:01:02,267
Well, I call you on your jack
and it's disconnected.

938
01:01:02,442 --> 01:01:05,969
You could have caught a tail. They could
have eyes and ears on us right now.

939
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:09,205
Better slow down how you talking to me.
I'll smack fire out you.

940
01:01:09,382 --> 01:01:11,509
And I don't give a fuck
if you a cop or no cop.

941
01:01:11,684 --> 01:01:13,879
- Understand me?
- Listen, you fucking cocksucker.

942
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:17,511
I don't care how much jack you think
you got, who's backing your play.

943
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:21,285
You come to my house, you try to
press me in front of my kids, my wife...

944
01:01:21,461 --> 01:01:23,429
...it's a fucking mistake.

945
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:27,464
- Yeah, laugh, you fucking scumbag.
- You hard as fuck, Jimmy, wow.

946
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,258
But you slipping, J. You slipping.

947
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:34,895
- Why is this motherfucker still breathing?
- We on a buzzer beater with you?

948
01:01:35,074 --> 01:01:37,065
- Is this a clock?
- Might as well be.

949
01:01:37,243 --> 01:01:41,043
I give you money,
and this shit ain't handled?

950
01:01:41,214 --> 01:01:44,115
You fucking with old boy,
you should be fucking with me, Jimmy.

951
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:47,514
- What's the problem? What's the problem?
- You glance at a TV lately?

952
01:01:47,687 --> 01:01:48,813
- Yeah.
- What'd you see?

953
01:01:48,988 --> 01:01:52,890
Your boys been getting blasted lately,
but I don't give a shit about that.

954
01:01:53,059 --> 01:01:56,620
I just wanna know, are we straight?
Are we straight, Jimmy?

955
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,161
Did I make the arrangement?
