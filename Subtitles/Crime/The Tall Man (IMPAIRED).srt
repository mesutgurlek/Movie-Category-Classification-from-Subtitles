- Hi, Julia.

She looks even worse than before.

194

She wouldn't mind a cup of coffee.

195

222
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,887
Oh, it's okay actually.
I sent them away to my sister's in Seattle.

223
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,973
She's got a big house and you know,
they're close to everything

and they're just kind of better off.

Carol's in no shape to travel, Tracy.

Yeah, but they made it there fine.

Okay, Julia, look, I still
got to make a living, okay?

228
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,776
I got a job interview in Kaslo in 45 minutes.

No, honestly.
Honestly, Trace, I understand.

You want me to make you
some coffee or something?

Yeah. You got to give me
some time with that, okay?

It's not so simple. He's...
He's kinda hard to handle.

But trust me,
you just got to let me handle this.
