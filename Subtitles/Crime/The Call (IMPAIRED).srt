01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,082
So when do the police get here?

1143
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,882
The police?

1144

Yeah.

1145
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,043
I escaped.

01:27:15,240 --> 01:27:17,208
Jordan found me in the woods.

1147
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,484
And you...

1148
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:23,805
disappeared.

1149
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,411
What?

1150
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:31,203
Where do you think you're going, huh?
Where you going? Hey!

01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:34,244
Hey! Unh! Wait!

1152
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,801
Hey, where you think
you're going, you bitch?

1153
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,444
You're just an operator.
You can't do this.

1154
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,321
You can't.

1155
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,766
It's already done.
No. Wait!
