her an actress, heh.

- Cover.

She's still in the bowl?

573
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,239
Maybe he tried but
she floated back up.

574
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,679
Tell him to flush her. Spenser
knows how to deal with floaters.

575

Tell him to use the

- Of course not.

at that hour specifically?

Just tell us your demands, please.

1432
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,166
What do I do?

1433
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,479
They think you're a superstar.

1434
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,001
I think they expect
you to act like one.

(WALLY SIGHS)

1436
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:09,279
I would like fresh flowers in
my room. Rare tropical flowers...

1437
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:10,759
that smell good.

1438
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,759
And ice in my dressing room...

1439
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:16,079
which should be a palace and
so should Lori's be a palace.

1440
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:20,080
And I want a dressing room
for my pet bloodhound too.

1441
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,559
And a poodle.

1442
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:25,319
And Lori's poodle. They
can bunk in together.

1443
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:29,002
But there better be fresh
flowers in there! And ice!

1444
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:32,399
- MAN: Whatever.
- Just so long as you produce the hits.

1445
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,639
- I'll do six a week.
- Six?

1446
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,839
Five.

1447
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,599
Mm-mm. No, not six. Five.

1448
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:41,007
But one of them will be for free.

1449
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:43,647
I want to do kids or old
people one day a week.

1450
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:48,399
And I want a StairMaster.

1451
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,519
I want a JuiceMaster.

1452
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,319
I want a ThighMaster and
I want a ButtMaster.

1453
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,524
If you can't give it to me,
I'm going back to Des Moines.

1454
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,288
Just don't hurt the help.

1455
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,330
It's whatever you want.

1456
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,679
I want this guy. He's fantastic.
I love working with him.

1457
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:08,759
I hope I've passed your audition.
Thank you for asking.

1458
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,279
Let's get creative.

1459
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:13,484
I'm thinking for our
opening season, Lori...

1460
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,359
as Juliet.

1461
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,119
Shakespeare in the Sand!

1462
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:20,479
You've got casting approval,
okay? For your lead.

1463
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,206
Joan of Arc for our action people.

1464
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:25,329
I set you afire.

1465
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,359
You behead him, right?

1466
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:29,050
Experimental.

1467
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,639
<i>Cats.</i>

1468
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:33,239
Wait a second! With people.

1469
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,999
People as cats. Let's workshop.

1470
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,479
Uh, you're both cats.

1471
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:40,679
You're my big cat. I've got
a giant cat. Get down.

1472
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,159
Creative producer.
Thank you. You're the dog.

1473
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:45,719
We've got a dog and a cat,
but they hate each other.

1474
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,490
Chase, chase.

1475
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:50,599
Go, go! Arf, arf, arf.
Cat, go, kitty, go!

1476
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,719
Lori and I are the husband and wife.
We have this cat and this dog.

1477
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:58,163
We love each of them, but
they hate each other.

1478
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:01,519
So you're the bad cat. The
only thing we can do is...

1479
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,564
Cut it out! Bad kitty! Bad cat!

1480
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,530
Is this working? Are you liking it?
