Looking like a chief.

1898
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:50,421
I don't know about that.
Maybe a lieutenant.

1899
01:47:50,423 --> 01:47:52,858
You look good.
Captain?

1900
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:55,526
Hey, Joe, I got through
to McClennan at Personnel.

1901
01:47:55,528 --> 01:47:57,229
And he's still holding
that slot for you

1902
01:47:57,231 --> 01:47:59,764
if you're ready to switch
to administration.

1903
01:47:59,766 --> 01:48:02,433
Yeah, can we talk about it
another time?

1904
01:48:03,236 --> 01:48:04,402
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1905
01:48:04,404 --> 01:48:05,703
Hey, good luck.

1906
01:48:05,705 --> 01:48:08,073
All right.

1907
01:48:08,075 --> 01:48:09,440
Now, what's this?

1908
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:14,446
Look, I meant to tell you.

1909
01:48:14,448 --> 01:48:16,182
I gotta start doing
the right thing.

1910
01:48:16,184 --> 01:48:18,251
I gotta start spending
more time at home.

1911
01:48:18,253 --> 01:48:20,586
I got three kids now.
What am I supposed to do?

1912
01:48:20,588 --> 01:48:24,023
Look, I was gonna talk
to you about it.

1913
01:48:24,858 --> 01:48:26,359
Do what you need to do.

1914
01:48:28,028 --> 01:48:30,296
They're gonna get started.
We should probably go in.

1915
01:48:30,298 --> 01:48:31,297
Come on.

1916
01:48:34,269 --> 01:48:36,736
<i>MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1917
01:48:36,738 --> 01:48:38,138
we shall begin
today's ceremony

1918
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:40,274
with the traditional invocation,

1919
01:48:40,276 --> 01:48:42,776
moving then
to the valedictorian address

1920
01:48:42,778 --> 01:48:45,678
to be given by
Robert Grusinsky,

1921
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:47,147
son of the late

1922
01:48:47,149 --> 01:48:49,950
Deputy Chief
Albert Grusinsky,

1923
01:48:49,952 --> 01:48:53,120
brother of
Captain Joseph Grusinsky.

1924
01:48:53,122 --> 01:48:54,888
You know,
as I look at that

1925
01:48:54,890 --> 01:48:57,158
fine young man
seated behind me,

1926
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:00,395
I can't help but think
of all the young members

1927
01:49:00,397 --> 01:49:01,695
of our department.

1928
01:49:01,697 --> 01:49:05,133
I get filled
with such pride.

1929
01:49:05,135 --> 01:49:08,803
Men like him are the future
of the force.

1930
01:49:10,172 --> 01:49:14,042
Let us remind ourselves
we are in God's presence.

1931
01:49:14,044 --> 01:49:15,109
Let us pray.

1932
01:49:15,111 --> 01:49:17,846
[♪]

1933
01:49:17,848 --> 01:49:20,782
O God, we come together
at this most joyous occasion,

1934
01:49:20,784 --> 01:49:24,954
the New York City Police
graduation ceremony.

1935
01:49:24,956 --> 01:49:27,289
We ask you to guide, bless

1936
01:49:27,291 --> 01:49:29,358
and protect those
who are graduating.

1937
01:49:30,493 --> 01:49:32,194
Please bless their families

1938
01:49:32,196 --> 01:49:34,430
and friends who gather
and share their joy.

1939
01:49:34,432 --> 01:49:35,564
I love you very much.

1940
01:49:35,566 --> 01:49:37,433
Strengthen us, our Lord,

1941
01:49:37,435 --> 01:49:38,600
now and forever.

1942
01:49:38,602 --> 01:49:40,036
I love you too.
Amen.

1943
01:49:40,038 --> 01:49:41,871
CROWD:
Amen.

1944
01:49:50,114 --> 01:49:52,048
