We might as well go sit down.

he tell you?

Not much.

at the mug books,

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,080
Beautiful place,
Tucson.

324
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,800
They can breathe
out there.

325
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,240
She's sleeping
too much.

326
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,680
It's not normal.

327
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,080
I've got a couple
of TV dinners in the oven.

328
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,040
Come on.

329
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,280
It will just be
a couple of minutes.

330
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,280
Jack, this drink's
enough for me.

331
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,680
I've never seen you drink
without eating.

332
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,600
I'm not hungry.

333
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,920
I think maybe you ought to take
Carol to see another doctor.

334
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,800
I did. Today.

335
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
A psychiatrist.

336
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,120
He seems to feel
it might help her

337
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,520
if I took her away
to another environment...

338
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,360
out of New York,
on the shore someplace.

339
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,800
Sounds like
a good idea.

340
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,280
I'll go along
with you.

341
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,160
Uh, no, Dad.

342
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,520
He seemed to feel
that it might be better

343
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,680
if she didn't have
any association with anyone

344
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,680
that might remind
her of that day.

345
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,400
How the hell do I
remind her of that day?

346
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,640
Well, you know
how it is, Dad.

347
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,760
It happened
in your apartment.

348
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,920
And you're
living there.

349
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,920
You remind her
of Mom.

350
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,560
Dad, don't make it
tough for me.

351
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,080
OK, I'll make it
easy for you.

352
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,000
Ives asked me to go
to Tucson, Arizona, on a job.

353
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,800
How long
will you be gone?

354
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,160
I don't know...
until I look the job over.

355
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,600
But you call me
every other day.

356
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,040
Let me know
how Carol is.

357
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,920
Sure I will, Dad.

358
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,320
You know, that will
be good for you.

359
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,320
I hear Tucson's
a really beautiful place.

360
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,120
Yeah, yeah.
That's what everybody says.

361
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,840
How are you
today, sir?

362
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,600
Son of a bitch.

363
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,320
Turn around,
son of a bitch.

364
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,320
Motherfucker!

365
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,520
I said
turn around.

366
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,360
Now hand me
the money.

367
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,880
Aah!

368
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,720
Paul Kersey.

369
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,680
Yeah.

370
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,640
Aimes Jainchill.

371
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,240
How do you do,
Mr. Jainchill?

372
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,680
Aimes.
I'll call you Paul.

373
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
Come on.
Let's get your bags.

374
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,920
How did you know
who I was?

375
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,360
Well, you look like
a New Yorker.

376
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,400
[Cattle Mooing]

377
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,760
Ho!

378
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,680
Howdy, Jud.

379
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
I wanted you
to see this country

380
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,560
before you looked at the
drawings back at the office.

381
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,280
Give you
a better idea.

382
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,320
I don't want to
change these hills.

383
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Don't want to
bulldoze them flat.

384
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,680
You'll waste a lot
of building space.

385
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,600
Ha ha!

386
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,040
Wasting space.

387
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,640
Now, those are some words
that you big developers

388
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,960
have got to change
for something else.

389
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,720
Such as?

390
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,200
Well,
space for life.

391
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,080
Like old Jud
up there.

392
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,200
Space for people,
horses, cows.

393
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,520
I got funny ideas
about building things.

394
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,880
Man: Howdy, folks.

395
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,480
Welcome to Old Tucson,

396
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,040
the famous movie location
and studio.

397
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,640
In just a few moments...

398
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,160
Come on.
Let's wet our whistle

399
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,640
before I trot you
back to the motel.

400
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,080
Glass of beer,
maybe.

401
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,880
Announcer: ...take their positions
on the porches and boardwalks

402
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,680
of the Red Dog Cafe,
the territorial gunsmith shop...

403
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,520
What's happening here?

404
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,240
Oh, it's a phony
western town.

405
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,600
They shoot movies
here sometimes,

406
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,360
but the rest of the time
it's for the tourists.

407
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,520
Announcer: this is where the
actual performance will take place.

408
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,920
These fellas
are pretty good.

409
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,440
You want
to watch this?

410
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,400
Announcer:
the Wild West lives again.

411
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,040
Man: Where's the Marshal?

412
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,760
Second Man:
He's in the bank.

413
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,760
I spotted him through
the window as I came by.

414
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,880
What have you
got in mind to do, then?

415
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,800
Well, why don't you
steal my horse?

416
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,800
All right.
That's a good trick. We'll use it.

417
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,320
You spot yourself
on the porch

418
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,320
while I draw the marshal
out into the open.

419
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,040
Marshal!
Hey, Marshal!

420
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,800
Marshal:
What's the matter, fella?

421
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,600
Somebody
stole my horse.

422
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,600
Marshal: I told you
to get out of town by sunset.

423
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,360
Man: You missing a bay mare
that was tied to the hitching rail?

424
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,160
Saw a feller come and
take her just a spell ago.

425
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,160
Marshal: well,
what did he look like?

426
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,120
Well, he was
about this tall, and he had this...

427
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,720
Get him, Frank!

428
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,600
Let's put him
inside here

429
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,320
and get to the bank
and make that withdrawal.

430
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,800
Marshal: All right,
boys. The fun's over.

431
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,120
Throw out your guns,
and step out with your hands up.

432
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,400
You'd better listen,
Marshal.

433
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,920
I've got 3 sticks
of dynamite here.

434
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,480
Don't be a fool.

435
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,480
Announcer: The outlaw life
seemed a shortcut to easy money,

436
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,440
which could buy
liquor, women,

437
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,440
and a turn
at the gambling table,

438
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,240
but there were
honest men with dreams

439
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,280
who would fight
to protect their...

440
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,920
Let's get that beer.

441
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,120
Announcer: ...and who were to plant
the roots that would grow into a nation.

442
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,560
Blue Ridge won't buy it.

443
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,040
I don't build a thing that's going
to be a slum in 20 years,

444
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,200
and I won't
doze those hills.

445
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,520
What I build
conforms to the land.

446
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,440
And you can't hear
the toilets flush next door.

447
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,200
You want our help,

448
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,080
you'll have to
let me work with it.

449
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,560
Well, up to a point,
I want your help.

450
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,040
Up to a point,
I'll give it to you.

451
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,320
When do I get
a look-see?

452
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
In a couple days.

453
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,880
Guard says you were here
till after midnight last night.

454
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,640
Yeah. That's
the way I work.

455
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,160
Somebody once said... I forget who...
that he never looked back

456
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,320
because something might
be gaining on him.

457
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,800
What's gaining
on you, Paul?

458
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,240
$20 million investment.
What else?

459
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,240
Well, I was
going to ask you

460
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,400
to have dinner
with me at the club,

461
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,720
but I don't think
you'd be very good company.

462
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,160
No, I don't think
I would.

463
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,520
It might amuse you,
though.

464
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,840
Being from New York,
maybe you never seen a club like this.

465
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,560
It's a gun club.
We shoot guns.

466
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,960
So goddamn much hoopla
from the gun control people.

467
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,680
Half the nation's scared
to even <i>hold</i> a gun!

468
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,600
You know,
like it was a snake,

469
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,000
it was going to bite
you or something.

470
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,400
Hell, a gun
is just a tool...

471
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,320
Like a hammer
or an ax.

472
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,440
Wasn't long ago,
used to put food on the table,

473
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,440
keep foxes out
of the chicken coop,

474
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,720
rustlers off the range,

475
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,320
bandits out of the bank.

476
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Paul, how long since you held
a pistol in your hand?

477
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,760
A long time.

478
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,600
Which war was yours...
Korea?

479
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,720
Yeah.

in a medical unit.

some fool mistook him
for a deer, you see...

525

won the toss.

It all boils down
to the fact

that she's had an experience

It's a real wild shot,

that the vigilante

are occupied.

More blacks are

What do you
want us to do...

increase the proportion
of white muggers
