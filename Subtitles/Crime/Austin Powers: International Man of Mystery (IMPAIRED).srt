1
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,250
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to my underground lair.

2
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,250
I have gathered here
before me...

3
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,850
the world's
deadliest assassins...

4
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:48,410
and yet each of you has failed
to kill Austin Powers.

5
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,170
That makes me angry,
and when Dr. Evil gets angry...

6
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,250
Mr. Bigglesworth gets upset.

7
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,050
And when Mr. Bigglesworth
gets upset...

8
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,770
people die!

9
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,370
Why must I be surrounded
by frickin' idiots?

10
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,970
Mustafa, Frau Farbissina...

11
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,850
I spared your lives
because I need you...

12
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,850
to help me rid the world
of Britain's top secret agent...

13
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,130
the only man
who can stop me now.

14
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,010
We must kill Austin Powers!

15
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,050
Yeah!

16
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,450
Come on, babies.
Work with me, people, all right?

17
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,650
Show me love.

18
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,050
Great, baby! Yeah!

19
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,530
Oh, behave.

20
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,210
It's Austin Powers!

21
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,050
It's Austin Powers!

22
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,850
Hello, Mrs. Kensington.

23
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,210
Hello, Austin.

24
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,810
Why don't you ever model
for me, Mrs. Kensington?

25
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,250
You know how Mr. Kensington
feels about that.

26
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,170
Oh, behave.

27
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,850
Yeah.

28
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,210
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

29
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:54,650
Ow!

30
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,650
Hello Austin.

31
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,690
I'm Basil Exposition
with British lntelligence.

32
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,650
We have just received
word that Dr. Evil...

33
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,490
is planning a trap for you
tonight...

34
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,650
at the Electric Psychedelic
Pussycat Swinger's Club...

35
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,250
here in swinging London.

36
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,650
We'll be there.

37
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,250
~Good sense, innocence, cripplin' mankind~
-There you go. Come on, baby. Yeah! Yeah!

38
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,450
~Good sense, innocence, cripplin' mankind~

39
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,050
~Dead kings, many things I can't define~

40
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,410
~Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind~

41
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,050
~Occasions, persuasions clutter your mind~
-Austin, it's a swinging shindig.

42
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,810
~Incense and peppermints, the color of time~
-Austin, it's a swinging shindig.

43
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,090
~Incense and peppermints, the color of time~

44
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,050
~Incense and peppermints, the color of time~
-It's my happening, baby, and it freaks me out!

45
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,210
~Who cares what games we choose?~
-It's my happening, baby, and it freaks me out!

46
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:46,530
~Who cares what games we choose?~

47
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,770
~Who cares what games we choose?~
-Yeah, man!

48
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,450
~Who cares what games we choose?~

49
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,050
~Little to win but nothin' to lose~

50
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,650
~Incense and peppermints, meaningless nouns~

51
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,050
~Turn on, tune in, turn your eyes around~

52
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:05,450
~Look at yourself,
look at yourself, yeah, yeah~

53
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,130
~Look at yourself, look at yourself~

54
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,810
~Look at yourself, look at yourself~
-Can I get you a drink, Mr. Powers?

55
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,730
~Look at yourself, look at yourself~
-Sure!

56
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,610
~Yeah, yeah!~
-Austin, we've got to look for Dr. Evil.

57
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,250
Wait.

58
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,650
I've got an idea.

59
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,490
Austin! Why on earth
did you hit that woman?

60
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,250
Right. Let me show you, baby.

61
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,530
That ain't no woman.

62
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,610
It's a man, man.

63
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,250
It's one of Dr. Evil's assassins.

64
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,730
Look out! He's got a knife!

65
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,570
Good work, Mrs. Kensington.

66
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,810
Alright. Get up!

67
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,770
Get up!

68
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,450
Right. Where's Dr. Evil? Huh?

69
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,450
Where is he?

70
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,610
There's the bastard.

71
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,890
Come on. Let's go.

72
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:52,850
Coming through.

73
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,050
Excuse me!

74
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,570
I've got you now, Dr. Evil.

75
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,930
Not this time.

76
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,970
Come, Mr. Bigglesworth!

77
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,850
See you in the future,
Mr. Powers.

78
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,570
My God! He's freezing himself.

79
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,050
And so Dr. Evil escaped...

80
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,370
and had himself
cryogenically frozen...

81
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,290
to return at a time when free
love no longer reigned...

82
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,650
and greed and corruption
ruled again.

83
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,130
Yes?

84
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,530
Commander Gilmour?

85
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,250
Speaking.

86
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,570
Commander, this is Ritter in
Sou-west Com Three.

87
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,890
We have a potential bogey
with erratic vectoring...

88
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,410
and an unorthodox entry angle.

89
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,410
What are you saying, son?

90
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,650
Well, it appears to be
in the shape of a Big Boy.

91
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,090
Good God. He's back.

92
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,930
Well, in many ways,
the Big Boy never left, sir.

93
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,850
He's always offered
the same high-quality meals...

94
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,650
at competitive prices.

95
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,250
Shut up.

96
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,210
Shall I scramble Tac HQ
for an intercept?

97
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,570
What's its current position?

98
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,850
I'm presently tracking it
over Nevada.

99
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,770
Oh, my God! The Big Boy's gone.

100
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,250
Listen, son...

101
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,170
I want you to forget
what you saw here today.

102
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,010
Phillips?

103
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,010
Call the President.

104
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,530
Prepare the jet,
bring my overnight bag...

105
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,650
and er... Phillips, feed my fish.

106
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,650
Not too much.

107
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,090
I'm off to London, England.

108
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,370
Powers volunteered
to have himself frozen...

109
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,650
in case Dr. Evil
should ever return.

110
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,690
Well, I hope your boy's up to it.

111
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:14,850
We don't want to have to bail
you guys out again like after WW II.

112
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,650
This is our celebrity vault.

113
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,250
Please.

114
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,010
So, who is this Austin Powers?

115
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:40,690
The ultimate gentleman spy.
Irresistible to women...

116
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,210
deadly to his enemies,
a legend in his own time.

117
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,450
Attention. Stage one:
laser cutting beginning.

118
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,690
Laser cutting complete.

119
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,650
Stage two: warm liquid
goo phase beginning.

120
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,930
Warm liquid goo phase complete.

121
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,210
Stage three:
reanimation beginning.

122
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,050
Reanimation complete.

123
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,330
Stage four:
cleansing beginning.

124
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,250
Cleansing complete.

125
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,330
Stage five:
evacuation beginning.

126
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,050
Evacuation comp-

127
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,850
Evacuation comp-

128
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,050
comp-

129
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,450
comp-

130
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,050
Evacuation comp-

131
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,050
Whe... Where am I?

132
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,090
You're in the Ministry of Defense.

133
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,050
It's 1997.

134
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,130
You've been cryogenically
frozen for 30 years.

135
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,850
Who are these people?

136
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,650
The shouting is a
temporary side effect...

137
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,450
of the unfreezing process.

138
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,450
Yes. I'm having
difficulty controlling...

139
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,570
the volume of my voice!

140
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:29,250
This is Commander Gilmour,
U.S. Strategic Command...

141
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,450
and General Borschevsky,
Russian Intelligence.

142
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,650
Russian Intelligence?
Are you mad?

143
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,050
A lot's happened
since you were frozen.

144
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,850
The cold war's over.

145
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,250
Well, finally, those capitalist pigs
will pay for their crimes, eh?

146
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,810
Eh, comrades, eh?

147
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,330
Austin, we won.

148
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,410
Oh. Groovy. Smashing.
Yay, capitalism.

149
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,850
Hello. Hello.

150
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,450
Mr. Powers,
the president's quite concerned.

151
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,930
We've got a madman
on the loose in Nevada.

152
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,050
Dr. Evil.

153
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,450
When do I begin?

154
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,650
Immediately.

155
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,730
You'll be working
with Miss Kensington.

156
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,890
Mrs. Kensington!

157
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,890
Austin, Mrs. Kensington
has long since retired.

158
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,330
Miss Kensington is her daughter.

159
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,290
Ah, here she is.

160
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,850
Vanessa is one
of our top agents.

161
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,450
My God, Vanessa's
got a fabulous body...

162
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,570
and I bet she shags like a minx.

163
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,650
How do I tell them that because
of the unfreezing process...

164
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,450
I have no inner monologue?

165
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,130
I hope I didn't say that
out loud just now.

166
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,050
Mr. Powers, my job is to
acclimatize you to the nineties.

167
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,370
You know, a lot's changed since 1967.

168
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,050
No doubt, luv,
but as long as people...

169
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,650
are still having promiscuous sex
with many anonymous partners...

170
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,730
without protection...

171
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,450
while at the same time experimenting
with mind-expanding drugs...

172
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,530
in a consequence-free
environment...

173
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,650
I'll be sound as a pound.

174
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,570
Well, erm... Agent Kensington
will get you all set up.

175
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,650
She's extremely dedicated.

176
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,850
So, Austin, good luck.

177
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,970
The world's depending on you.

178
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,650
Thanks, Exposition.

179
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,850
Oh and, Austin...

180
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,850
Yes?

181
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,210
Be careful!

182
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,850
Thanks.

183
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,810
Danger Powers' personal effects.

184
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,970
Actually, my name
is Austin Powers.

185
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,050
It says here Name:
"Danger Powers"

186
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,370
No, no, no, no, no.

187
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,570
Danger's my middle name.

188
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,210
Okay. Austin Danger Powers

189
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,250
One blue crushed velvet suit...

190
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,330
Oh hey, all right.

191
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,930
One frilly lace cravat...

192
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,250
There it is.

193
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,050
One silver medallion
with male symbol...

194
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,850
-One pair of Italian boots...
-Buon giorno, boys.

195
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,650
One vinyl record album...

196
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,810
-Burt Bacharach plays his hits...
-Hey Burt! Hey. Yeah.

197
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:17,250
One Swedish-made
penis enlarger pump...

198
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,050
That's not mine.

199
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,970
One credit card receipt for
Swedish-made penis enlarger...

200
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,250
signed by Austin Powers.

201
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,170
I'm telling you, baby,
that's not mine.

202
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,930
One warranty card for Swedish-made
penis enlarger pump...

203
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,450
filled out by Austin Powers.

204
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,650
I don't even know what this is. This
sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.

205
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,450
One book: Swedish-made
Penis Enlarger Pumps And Me...

206
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,890
(This sort of thing
is my bag, baby)...

207
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,450
by Austin Powers.

208
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,650
Ah.

209
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,330
Just sign the form.

210
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,570
Okay. Don't get heavy, man. I'll sign it,
just to get things moving, you know.

211
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,290
You're all right, baby?

212
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,210
Listen, Mr. Powers.

213
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,050
Erm... I look forward
to working with you but...

214
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,050
do me a favor and
stop calling me baby.

215
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,810
You can address me as...
Agent Kensington.

216
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,650
Oh, come on.

217
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,850
All right, then...Vanessa.

218
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,610
Was that so hard?

219
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,050
Now, come along.
We have to leave immediately.

220
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,450
We preserved your private jet
just as you left it.

221
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,890
It's waiting
at Heathrow Airport.

222
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,050
My jumbo jet! Smashing, baby!

223
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,210
Oops! Sorry.

224
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,010
Mister Powers.

225
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,450
Quickly.

226
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,050
Quickly. Come on, lad. Let's go.

227
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,330
Gentlemen, welcome
to my underground lair.

228
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,250
It's been 30 years,
but I'm back.

229
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,450
Everything's gone perfectly
to plan...

230
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,650
except for one small flaw...

231
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,810
Due to a technical error
by my henchman Mustafa...

232
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,650
complications arose
in the unfreezing process.

233
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,690
But my design was perfect.

234
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,650
Look what you did
to Mr. Bigglesworth!

235
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,730
But, Dr. Evil, we were
unable to anticipate

236
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,330
feline complications to
the reanimation process...

237
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,450
Silence!

238
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,650
Let this be a
reminder to you all...

239
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,850
that this organization
will not tolerate failure.

240
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,250
Gentlemen, let's
get down to business.

241
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,850
We've got a lot of work to do.

242
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,170
Somebody help me!

243
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,290
I'm still alive, only
I'm very badly burned.

244
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,650
Some of you I know...

245
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,250
some of you I'm meeting
for the first time.

246
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,250
Hello up there! Anyone!

247
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,250
Could someone call an ambulance?
I'm in quite a lot of pain.

248
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,050
Okay. You've all been gathered
here to form my evil cabinet.

249
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,090
Excuse me.

250
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,730
Yes. He's down there.

251
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,810
No, not dead.
Burned. Badly.

252
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,250
Yes.

253
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,450
Right.

254
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,850
If somebody could open
the retrieval hatch down here...

255
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,850
I could get out.

256
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,450
See, I designed this device myself...

257
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,130
Oh. Ah.

258
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,650
Good. I'm glad
you found me. Listen...

259
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,650
I'm very badly burned,
so if you could just...

260
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,250
You shot me!

261
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,850
Okay. Moving on ...

262
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,690
You shot me right
in the arm! Why did...

263
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,650
Right. Let me go around the table
and introduce everyone.

264
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,450
Frau Farbissina -

265
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,650
founder of the militant wing
of the Salvation Army.

266
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:07,450
Random Task - Korean ex-wrestler,
evil handyman extraordinaire.

267
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,850
Random Task, show
them what you do.

268
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,050
Patty O'Brien - ex-Irish assassin.

269
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,450
His trademark -
a superstitious man...

270
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,050
he leaves a tiny keepsake
from his good luck bracelet...

271
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,850
on every victim he kills.

272
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:39,450
Scotland Yard would love to get their
hands on that piece of evidence.

273
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:42,690
Yeah. They're always
after me lucky charms.

274
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,850
What? Why does everyone always
laugh when I say that?

275
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,250
They are after me lucky charms!

276
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,930
What?

277
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,650
It's a television commercial...

278
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,250
with this cartoon leprechaun...

279
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,170
and all of these children
are trying to chase him...

280
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,650
"Hey, leprechaun man!
Leprechaun man!"

281
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,650
"Won't you give
your Lucky Charms?"

282
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,650
Oh. And there's all these little
tiny bits of marshmallows...

283
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,650
just stuck right in the cereal...

284
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,050
so that when the kids
eat them, they think...

285
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,450
"Oh, this is candy.
I'm having fun!"

286
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,050
Finally, we come to my
number-two man. His name...

287
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,450
Number Two.

288
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,250
For 30 years, Number
Two has run Virtucon...

289
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,450
the legitimate face
of my evil empire.

290
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,850
Dr. Evil,
over the last 30 years...

291
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,050
Virtucon has grown
by leaps and bounds.

292
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:43,450
About 15 years ago, we changed
from volatile chemicals...

293
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,450
to the communications industry.

294
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,450
We own cable companies
in 38 states.

295
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,850
We own a steel mill
in Cleveland...

296
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,850
shipping in Texas,
oil refineries in Seattle...

297
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,450
and a factory in Chicago...

298
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,450
that makes miniature
models of factories.

299
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,650
Naturally.

300
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,650
Gentlemen...

301
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,250
I have a plan.

302
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,690
It's called blackmail.

303
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,050
As you know, the royal
family of Britain...

304
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,690
are the wealthiest
landowners in the world.

305
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:27,050
Either the royal family pays us
an exorbitant amount of money...

306
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,450
or we make it seem
that Prince Charles...

307
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:36,250
has had an affair outside of marriage
and therefore, would have to divorce.

308
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,330
Prince Charles did have an affair...

309
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,250
he admitted it, and
they are now divorced.

310
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,850
Right. Okay, people, you have to
tell me these things, all right?

311
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,850
I've been frozen for 30 years. Okay?

312
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,730
Throw me a frickin' bone here.

313
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,570
I'm the boss. Need the info.

314
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,850
Okay. No problem.

315
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,050
Here's my second plan.

316
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,930
Back in the sixties, I developed
a weather-changing machine...

317
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:07,050
which was in essence a sophisticated
heat beam which we called a "laser".

318
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,250
Using these "lasers",
we punch a hole...

319
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,250
in the protective layer
around the world...

320
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:15,130
which we call the "ozone layer".

321
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,130
Slowly but surely, ultraviolet
rays would pour in...

322
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,650
increasing the risk of skin
cancer. That is...

323
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,250
...unless...

324
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,050
...the world
pays us a hefty ransom.

325
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,050
That also already has happened.

326
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,170
Shit.

327
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,850
Oh, hell, let's just do
what we always do:

328
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,050
hijack some nuclear weapons
and hold the world hostage.

329
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,650
Good. Gentlemen, it's
come to my attention

330
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,250
that a breakaway Russian republic,
Kreplachistan...

331
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,250
is about to transfer
a nuclear warhead...

332
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,050
to the United Nations
in a few days.

333
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,450
Here's the plan.

334
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:59,250
We get the warhead and we
hold the world ransom for...

335
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,050
one million dollars!

336
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,650
Don't you think we should maybe ask
for more than a million dollars?

337
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:14,570
A million dollars isn't exactly
a lot of money these days.

338
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,890
Virtucon alone makes
over $9 billion a year.

339
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:19,850
Really?

340
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,450
That's a lot more.

341
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,450
OK, then.

342
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,650
We hold the world ransom for...

343
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,050
one hundred billion dollars!

344
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,610
~Austin Powers, he's the man for you!~

345
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:38,170
~Austin Powers, he's the man for you!~
-Pretty groovy jumbo jet, eh?

346
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,250
When you see this jet a-rockin' don't
come a-knockin', baby! Yeah.

347
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,570
I'm going to need you to sign
these release forms.

348
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,650
Release forms?

349
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,090
Oh, yes. You're not officially
working for Ministry of Defense...

350
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,650
and these forms indemnify
the ministry against...

351
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,650
any mishaps that may occur
in the line of duty.

352
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,450
Mishaps?

353
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,530
But isn't that what being an
international man of mystery's all about?

354
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:04,050
Okay. Name: Austin... Danger Powers.

355
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,570
Sex: Yes, please!

356
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,650
How does a hot chick like you end up
working at the Ministry of Defense?

357
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,850
Uh. Well, I went to Oxford...

358
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,250
where I excelled
in several subjects...

359
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,690
but I ended up specializing
in foreign languages.

360
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,450
Now, I really wanted to travel.

361
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,210
You know,
sort of see the world?

362
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,450
That's fascinating, Vanessa.

363
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,450
Listen, why don't we go
in the back and shag?

364
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,290
What?

365
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,850
I've been frozen for 30 years.

366
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,690
I've gotta see if my bits
and pieces are still working.

367
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,650
Excuse me?

368
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,250
My wedding tackle.

369
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,210
I'm sorry, I...

370
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,730
My meat and two veg,
my twig and berries.

371
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,450
-Hello, lads, you still awake? Hello?
-Mr. Powers! Mr. Powers, please.

372
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,450
I'd appreciate it if you could
concentrate on our mission and...

373
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,410
give your libido a rest.

374
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,850
Can I er...

375
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,650
Can I show you something?

376
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:54,050
~If you're feeling sad and lonely~

377
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,050
~There's a service I can render~

378
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,850
~Tell the one who loves you, only~

379
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,450
~I can be so warm and tender~

380
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,250
~I can be so warm and tender~
-I won't bite...

381
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,250
~Call me.~
-I won't bite...

382
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:06,450
~Call me.~

383
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,650
~Don't be afraid, you can~
-hard.

384
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,010
~Don't be afraid, you can~

385
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,250
~Call me.~

386
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,210
~Maybe it's late, but just~

387
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:12,610
~Call me.~

388
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,650
~Call me.~
-All right.

389
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,610
~Tell me and I'll be around.~

390
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,130
~Tell me and I'll be around.~
-Let me ask you a question,

391
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,450
and be honest.

392
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,250
Do I make you horny?

393
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,650
Randy?

394
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,450
Do I make you horny,
baby? Yeah! Do I?

395
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,450
God!

396
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,650
-I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.

397
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,450
"We're experiencing a bit of turbulence!"
-I hope this is part of the unfreezing process.

398
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:29,690
"We're experiencing a bit of turbulence!"

399
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,050
"We're experiencing a bit of turbulence!"
-Oh, turbulence!

400
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:30,850
"We would like to ask you to fasten"
-Oh, turbulence!

401
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,250
"We would like to ask you to fasten"
-Oh, look at that! Oh, turbulence!

402
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,970
"your seat-belts. Seat-belts fasten."
-Oh, look at that! Oh, turbulence!

403
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:33,850
Oh, I've gone over!

404
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,450
Oh, I fell over again!

405
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,450
Mister Powers!

406
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,050
I will never have
sex with you, ever!

407
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,050
If you were the last man on Earth and
I was the last woman on Earth...

408
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,250
and the future
of the human race...

409
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,770
depended on our having sex
simply for procreation...

410
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,130
I still would not
have sex with you.

411
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,690
What's your point, Vanessa?

412
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:01,690
~...me. Don't be afraid.
You can call me.~

413
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:05,290
~Maybe it's late but just call me.~

414
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,850
~tell me and I'll be around.~

415
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,050
Yeah!

416
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,050
Remember when we froze
your semen?

417
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,450
You said if it didn't look
like you were coming back...

418
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,450
we should try to make you a son...

419
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,250
so that a part of
you could live forever.

420
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,050
Oh, sure.

421
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:25,650
Well, after a couple of years,
we got a little impatient.

422
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,450
Dr. Evil, I want
you to meet your son.

423
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,450
My son?

424
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,650
Ya.

425
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,650
Scott!

426
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,850
Hello, Scott.

427
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,050
Hi.

428
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,650
I'm your father.

429
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,250
Dr. Evil.

430
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,650
I haven't seen you
my whole life...

431
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,250
and... and now you come back
and just expect a relationship?

432
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,050
I hate you.

433
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,530
What?

434
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,450
Could I have a hug?

435
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:07,850
No.

436
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,130
-Give me a hug.
-No way.

437
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,330
-Come here!
-I'm not coming over there.

438
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,450
-Let's go.
-Forget it.

439
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,250
-Pronto.
-What are you doing?

440
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,130
I'm with it. I'm hip.

441
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,850
Don't look at me
like I'm frickin' Frankenstein.

442
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,050
Give your father a hug.

443
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,050
-You're... Hey, don't touch me!
-Hug! Hug! Hug!

444
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,130
Hug...

445
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,250
-Hug!
-Get away from me, you lazy-eyed psycho!

446
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,330
Viva Las Vegas, baby! Yeah!

447
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,450
Wow! Ooh! Yeah!

448
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,850
Welcome to Las Vegas, sir.

449
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,450
So, which side of the
bed do you want?

450
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,850
You're sleeping on the sofa, Mr. Powers.

451
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,250
In fact, I'd like to take this
opportunity to remind you...

452
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,850
that the only reason
we're sharing a room...

453
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,650
is to keep up the context that we're
a married couple on vacation.

454
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,850
Right. Shall we shag now,
or shall we shag later?

455
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,050
How do you like to do it?
Do you like to wash up first...

456
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,090
you know, top and tails,
whore's bath?

457
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,250
Personally, before I'm on the job, I like
to give my undercarriage...

458
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,850
a bit of a how's-your-father.

459
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,850
I'm just joking, Vanessa. I'm just
trying to get a rise out of you...

460
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,370
that's all, for shits and giggles.

461
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,850
Let's unpack.

462
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,450
Oh, blimey!

463
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,450
Nerd alert!

464
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,050
How did this get in here?

465
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,850
Somebody's
playing a prank on me.

466
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,250
Honestly, it's not mine.

467
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,250
Hey, Americans! Yeah!

468
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,450
Enjoy that wine.

469
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,850
Hey, there you are.

470
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,210
Hi! Do I know you?

471
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,650
No, but that's where you are.
You're there.

472
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:35,050
Hey! Viva Las Vegas, baby. Hey!

473
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,250
-Okay, Austin.
-Yes?

474
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,170
Austin, there's a company
in Las Vegas called Virtucon...

475
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,250
which we think may be
linked to Dr. Evil.

476
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,050
Plenty of Virtucon executives
are gambling in this casino.

477
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,570
Smashing. Let's go.

478
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,850
Look. There's one over there.

479
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,450
Changing a thousand.

480
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,850
Hello. Excuse me.

481
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,850
Do you mind if I join you?

482
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,250
Not at all.

483
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,050
The game is blackjack,
gentlemen.

484
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,650
Ten thousand dollars
minimum bet.

485
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,050
King for you, sir,
and a three for you.

486
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,850
Seventeen?

487
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,250
Hit me.

488
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,530
You have 17, sir.

489
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,250
I like to live dangerously.

490
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,650
Four. Twenty-one.

491
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:37,850
Five.

492
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,170
I'll stay.

493
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,290
I suggest you hit, sir.

494
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,650
I also like to live dangerously.

495
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,650
As you wish, sir.

496
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,050
Twenty beats your five.

497
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,250
I'm sorry, sir.

498
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,050
Well, I won't lie to you.

499
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,850
Cards are not my bag, baby.

500
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,850
Allow myself to introduce...

501
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,850
myself.

502
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:15,650
My name is Richie Cunningham,
and this is my wife Oprah.

503
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,250
My name is Number Two.

504
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,450
This is my Italian
confidential secretary.

505
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,050
Her name is Alotta...

506
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,050
Alotta Fagina.

507
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,930
Come again?

508
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,650
Alotta Fagina.

509
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,050
Ah, sorry, I'm just not getting it.

510
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,250
It sounded like you said
your name was a lot of...er...

511
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,250
Never mind.

512
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,850
What exactly do you do,
Mr. Number Two?

513
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,250
That's my business.

514
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,250
Oh.

515
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,050
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
to go to the little boys' room.

516
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,450
You keep your eye
on the Italian bird.

517
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,050
We'll rendezvous
back at the hotel suite.

518
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,050
You didn't happen to see...

519
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,050
anything at all?

520
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,450
Sorry.

521
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,050
Howdy.

522
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,850
That is one crazy getup
you got there, fella.

523
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,850
Oh, thank you.

524
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,050
Are you in the show?

525
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,850
Ah, no, actually, I'm English.

526
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:45,850
Ooh, I'm sorry.

527
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,650
Right.

528
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,450
Hey, partner?

529
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,050
Have a good one.

530
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,450
Okay.

531
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,450
Hey, partner, come on, you
gotta relax. Don't force it.

532
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,650
Gonna blow out your o-ring,
drop a lung.

533
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:46,250
Who does Number Two work for?

534
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:50,250
Who does Number Two work for?

535
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,890
That's right, buddy.
You show that turd who's boss.

536
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:00,010
Hey! Hey, just grab ahold of something,
bite your lip, and give it hell. Come on!

537
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,050
We're gonna get through this.

538
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,450
Hey, that sounds pretty nasty. How
about a courtesy flush over there?

539
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,850
Jesus Christ, boy.

540
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,330
What did you eat?

541
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,050
Gentlemen...

542
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,650
the warhead is ours.

543
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,490
Patch me through to the United Nations
security secret meeting room.

544
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,850
Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil.

545
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:49,530
In a little while you'll notice that the
Kreplachistani warhead has gone missing.

546
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:53,250
If you want it back, you're
going to have to pay me...

547
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,650
One million dollars!

548
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,050
Sorry.

549
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,250
One hundred billion dollars.

550
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,250
Gentlemen, silence.

551
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,210
Now, Mr. Evil...

552
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,650
Dr. Evil.

553
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:20,650
I didn't spend six years in evil medical school
to be called "Mister", thank you very much.

554
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:22,970
It is the policy
of the United Nations...

555
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,650
not to negotiate
with terrorists.

556
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,130
Really?

557
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,250
So long.

558
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:43,050
Gentlemen, in exactly five days,
we will be $100 billion richer.

559
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,250
Hello? Mommy?

560
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,250
Hello, Vanessa.

561
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,090
And? How's Austin?

562
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,850
He's asleep.

563
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,730
You didn't.

564
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,850
Oh, God! No! No, I made
him sleep on the sofa.

565
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,730
Vanessa, I'm proud of you.

566
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,330
Why?

567
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:39,250
Because you've managed to
resist Austin Powers' charms!

568
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,050
What? God knows he tried, mommy.

569
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,330
I actually had to be
rather firm with him.

570
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,530
You didn't tell me he
is so obsessed with sex!

571
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,130
It's really bizarre.

572
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,450
You can't judge him
by modern standards.

573
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,770
What about his teeth?

574
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,450
Darling, you have to understand,
in Britain in the sixties...

575
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,850
you could be a sex symbol
and still have bad teeth.

576
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,250
It didn't matter.

577
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:02,050
I don't get that, mommy.

578
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:07,050
Once Austin has you in his charms,
it's impossible to get out.

579
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:07,970
Did you ever?

580
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,650
Me? No, of course not.

581
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,490
I was married to your father.

582
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,570
You didn't ever want to, did you?

583
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,450
Austin is very charming very debonair.

584
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,850
He's handsome, witty...

585
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,690
has a knowledge of fine wines.

586
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,170
He's sophisticated.

587
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,850
A world renown photographer.

588
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,850
Women want him,
and men want to be him.

589
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,450
Every bit an
international man of mystery.

590
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,450
Yeah, but you didn't
answer my question, mummy.

591
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,930
I know.

592
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,530
Let me just say this...

593
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,650
Austin was the most
loyal and caring friend I ever had.

594
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,050
I will always love him.

595
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,250
Uh! Ah.

596
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:53,850
Do you want to speak to him?

597
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,850
No. It's been too long.

598
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,450
Okay, well, now, I'm going to
have to go, mummy, but I love you.

599
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,050
Ciao, darling.

600
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,130
A limo's just pulled up.

601
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,450
Let me see.

602
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,170
-That's Dr. Evil's cat.
-How can you tell?

603
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,850
I never forget a pussy...

604
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,450
cat.

605
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,250
Oh, no. He's gone away.

606
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:31,250
My God, Vanessa,
you are so incredibly beautiful.

607
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,450
-Oh, no.
-That's it. Yes. Yes. Yes.

608
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,730
Come on, darling...

609
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,850
I want take you out
for a night on the town.

610
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,250
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Burt Bacharach.

611
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,250
~What the world needs now~

612
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,050
~Is love, sweet love.~

613
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,450
~No, not just for some~

614
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,450
~no, but everyone.~

615
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:12,650
~What the world needs now~

616
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:16,650
~Is love, sweet love.~

617
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:20,650
~No, not just for some~

618
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:28,450
~but for everyone.~

619
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,250
Oh, yeah.

620
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,450
-Oh god, Austin, get on with it.
-I'm going to do it.

621
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,050
-Do you want me to do it?
-Ah! Oh, go on!

622
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,250
-Do you want me to do it?
-Yes!

623
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:04,250
Okay. Right hand green!

624
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:04,810
~You showed me how to do~

625
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,450
~You showed me how to do~
-Oh no. No!

626
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,450
~You showed me how to do~

627
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,210
~Exactly what you do~

628
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,650
~Exactly what you do~
-You all right?

629
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:09,810
~How I fell in love with you~

630
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,010
~How I fell in love with you~
-You all right?

631
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,050
~How I fell in love with you~
-Oh, you know what?

632
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,450
Wait a tick.
I forgot something in the lobby.

633
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,050
Why don't I take the stairs?

634
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,450
Why take the stairs
when I could take the escalator?

635
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,850
Why take the escalator when
I've got a perfectly good canoe?

636
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,250
I know what...
I'll take the elevator.

637
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,250
Austin?

638
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,450
Yes?

639
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,010
~And now you love me too~

640
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,850
~And now you love me too~
-Come and have some champagne with me.

641
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:49,850
~And now you love me too~
-Okay.

642
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:50,450
~And now you love me too~

643
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,450
Oh, I tripped. Uh.

644
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,450
You know, I haven't had
this much fun since college.

645
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,050
Well, I'm sorry.

646
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,650
~And now you love me too~

647
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:58,650
~And now you love me too~
-Why?

648
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,050
~And now you love me too~
-I'm sorry that bug up your ass

649
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,650
had to die.

650
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,450
Always wanting to have fun, Austin,
that's you in a nutshell.

651
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,770
No, this is me in a nutshell.

652
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,850
Help! I'm in a nutshell!

653
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,450
How did I get
into this nutshell?

654
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,050
Look at the size of
this bloody great big nutshell.

655
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,850
What sort of shell
has a nut like this?

656
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,450
I mean, this is crazy.

657
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,650
Yes, look at you.

658
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,450
-You're smashed.
-No, I'm not.

659
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,650
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not. I'm the sensible one.

660
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:29,050
I'm always the
designated driver.

661
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,250
-Kiss me.
-I can't, darling.

662
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,650
-Why not?
-'Cause you're drunk. It's not right.

663
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,570
No, I'm not drunk.

664
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,890
I'm just beginning to see what my mummy
was talking about all those years ago.

665
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,210
I can't.

666
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,450
Tell me all about my mummy in the sixties.
I'm dying to know what she was like.

667
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,850
She was very groovy.

668
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,650
Your dad loved her very much.

669
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,050
If there was one other cat
in this world...

670
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,450
that could have loved her and treated
her as well as your dad...

671
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,050
then it was me.

672
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:11,610
But unfortunately
for yours truly...

673
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,610
that train has sailed.

674
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,650
Vanessa?

675
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,250
Vanessa? Hello?

676
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,650
Come on, roll over. Sleepytime.

677
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,250
Okay, Austin needs his hand back.

678
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,450
You've got mail.

679
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:49,650
Hello, Austin. This is Basil
Exposition from British Intelligence.

680
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,050
Now, I want you to find out
what part Virtucon plays...

681
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:55,450
in something called
Project Vulcan.

682
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:59,450
I need you to go to Alotta
Fagina's penthouse immediately.

683
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,650
Hello, hello.

684
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,850
Yes, yes. Okay. Great!

685
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,450
Project Vulcan.

686
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,650
Yeah. Okay. Cheeky, huh? Yeah.

687
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,850
Come on, baby, give it to me.
Yes. Yes. Yes!

688
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:46,850
NO! NO!

689
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,650
You seem surprised to see me,
Miss Fagina.

690
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,530
What do you want Mister...
Cunningham, was it?

691
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,170
Please, call me Richie.

692
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:10,450
Miss Fagina, your boss,
Number Two...

693
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:15,370
I understand that cat's
involved in big underground drills.

694
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:16,650
How did you know?

695
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,690
I didn't, baby.

696
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,650
You just told me.

697
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,250
It's for the mining
industry Mr. Cunningham.

698
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,250
You know, er... we can
talk about business later.

699
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:30,330
Let me slip into
something more comfortable.

700
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,250
Oh, behave.

701
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,850
~The look~

702
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,650
~of love~

703
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,050
~is in~

704
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,850
~your eyes~

705
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,450
-~A look~
-Good God.

706
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,650
~your smile~

707
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,650
~can't disguise~

708
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,050
~the look~

709
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:56,850
~of love~

710
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:05,050
~is saying so much more than
his words could ever say~

711
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:14,250
~you know when my heart has heard,
well, it takes my breath away~

712
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:20,850
~I can hardly wait to hold,
feel my arms around you~

713
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,650
~You've got the look~

714
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:24,410
~You've got the look~
-Come in...

715
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:24,770
~of love~
-Come in...

716
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:25,730
~of love~

717
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:26,530
~of love~
-and I'll show you

718
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:26,730
~of love~
-everything you need to know.

719
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,250
~it's on~
-everything you need to know.

720
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:31,050
~your face~

721
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:39,930
~and when my heart has heard,
well, it takes my breath away~

722
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:46,650
~I can hardly wait to hold,
feel my arms around you~

723
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:49,850
~You've got the look~

724
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,450
~of love~

725
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,450
~it's on~

726
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,890
~your face~

727
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,210
~the look...~

728
00:44:58,450 --> 00:44:59,650
May I wash you?

729
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,850
Oh, groovy, baby. Yeah.

730
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,250
Mmh, yes.

731
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:17,650
That feels yummy.

732
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:29,250
In Japan, men come first,
and women come second.

733
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:31,250
Or sometimes not at all.

734
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,850
Care for some sak?

735
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:38,890
Sak it to me, baby.

736
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,290
Yes.

737
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,650
Klinky?

738
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:46,050
Klinky.

739
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,970
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?

740
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:02,370
I feel extreme relaxation.

741
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,050
How dare you
break wind before me?

742
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,450
I'm sorry, baby.
I didn't know it was your turn.

743
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,650
Pardon me for being rude. It was not me.
It was my food. It just popped up

744
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:23,210
to say hello and now it's gone
back down below.

745
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,050
That's beautiful.

746
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:26,490
Thank you.

747
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:32,250
What exactly do
you do at Virtucon?

748
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:34,330
I will tell you all in due time.

749
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:35,850
But first...

750
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:41,450
Let's make love
you silly hairy little man.

751
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:44,010
I say! Hello, vicar.

752
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,050
Ooh, that is the spot, all right.

753
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:52,250
That's the spot right there.
Look at that, now. Good God.

754
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,850
Austin Powers
is getting too close.

755
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,770
Any suggestions?

756
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:03,450
Jawohl! herr doctor!

757
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:08,250
I have created the ultimate
weapon to defeat Austin Powers.

758
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:11,650
Bring in the fembots!

759
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:24,650
~You keep saying,
you got something for me.~

760
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,250
~Something you call love, but confess~
-Go, fembots!

761
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:30,050
~Something you call love, but confess~

762
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:31,650
-These are the latest word

763
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:32,130
~You been messin'~
-These are the latest word

764
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:33,250
~You been messin'~
-in android replicant technology.

765
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,850
~where you shouldn't been messin'~
-in android replicant technology.

766
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,450
~where you shouldn't been messin'~
-Lethal, efficient, brutal.

767
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,450
~and now someone else is gettin'~
-Lethal, efficient, brutal.

768
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:41,250
~all your best.~
-No man can resist their charm.

769
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:42,450
-Send in the guards!

770
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:42,850
~These boots are made for walkin'~
-Send in the guards!

771
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:45,250
~These boots are made for walkin'~

772
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,850
~And that's just what they'll do~

773
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:47,450
~And that's just what they'll do~
-Kill these women.

774
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,650
-Kill these women.

775
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:49,450
~One of these days,~
-Kill these women.

776
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:53,570
~These boots are
gonna walk all over you.~

777
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:01,050
~Are you ready, boots?~

778
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:02,850
~Start walking!~

779
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:14,450
Quite impressive.

780
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,450
Thank you, herr doctor.

781
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:19,650
I like to see girls of that...

782
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:21,250
caliber.

783
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,450
By caliber, of course I mean...

784
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,570
both the size of
their gun barrels...

785
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,370
and the high quality of their
character. It's two meanings.

786
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,650
Caliber...

787
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,450
It's a homonym.

788
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,650
Forget it.

789
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,450
At ease, boys.

790
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,450
Austin, I want to
show you something.

791
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,970
We're going to
outfit you with this.

792
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:54,610
It looks like a
watch, but, in fact

793
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,050
it's a geosynchronous
positioning device.

794
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,650
Very shagadelic.

795
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,650
And then there's this.

796
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:01,850
Okay, let me guess.

797
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,930
The floss is garrote wire...

798
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,850
the toothpaste
is plastic explosives...

799
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,850
and the toothbrush
is the detonation device.

800
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,690
No, actually.

801
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,450
Well, since you've been frozen

802
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:16,650
there have been fabulous
advances in the field of dentistry.

803
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,050
What do you mean?

804
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:19,850
Nothing.

805
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,650
Oh, look, here's Basil.

806
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:23,050
Hello, Exposition.

807
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,850
Austin. Let me
bring you up to speed.

808
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:29,930
Dr. Evil has hijacked a
nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan.

809
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:34,330
Only two things scare me,
and one is nuclear war.

810
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:35,450
What's the other?

811
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,250
Excuse me?

812
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,010
What's the other thing
that scares you?

813
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,050
Carnies.

814
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,250
What?

815
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:42,570
Circus folk.

816
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:43,850
Nomads, you know.

817
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,370
Smell like cabbage.

818
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:47,250
Small hands.

819
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,650
Oh, er... indeed.

820
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,330
Perhaps these photographs are
the last piece of the puzzle.

821
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:53,330
Aha!

822
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,650
I've uncovered the details
of Project Vulcan.

823
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:58,250
Oh, good God.
An underground missile?

824
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,130
Austin, where did you find these?

825
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:04,850
Austin did some reconnaissance work
last night at Alotta Fagina's penthouse.

826
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:08,850
-Oh.
-Our next move is to infiltrate Virtucon.

827
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:10,050
Any ideas?

828
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:15,250
Oh, yes. Virtucon runs a tour
of its facility every hour.

829
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:18,250
I thought, perhaps, we could
disguise ourselves as tourists

830
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:20,250
and do some
on-site reconnaissance.

831
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,650
Top drawer, Kensington.

832
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:25,570
Oh, er... Austin, I'd
like you to meet somebody.

833
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:29,450
This is my mother...
Mrs. Exposition.

834
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,370
How do you do?

835
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:33,170
Austin!

836
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,650
My God, man, what have you done?

837
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,850
That's not your mother.
It's a man, baby!

838
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:40,650
Yeah, yeah. Come on!

839
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:43,250
Why won't this wig come off?

840
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:44,850
Help!

841
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,650
-Austin!
-Yeah, hold on, hold on one second.

842
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,450
No, no! Let go of my mother!

843
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:52,050
Oh. Oh, mother. Mother,
are you all right?

844
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,050
-Austin, have you gone mad?
-No.

845
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,850
You have a lot
of explaining to do.

846
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,370
I'm sorry, Basil.
I thought she was a man.

847
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,450
Damn it, man. You're
talking about my mother!

848
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:04,850
Well, you have to admit,
she is rather mannish.

849
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:05,650
Austin!

850
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,970
Well, no offense, but...

851
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:10,650
if that is a woman it does look like
she was beaten with an ugly stick.

852
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:12,650
-What?
-Really, Austin.

853
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:23,050
Okay. Give in to the beauty of
your feelings and say the words.

854
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,250
Come on.

855
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,490
I love you, Dad.

856
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,850
I love you, too, son.

857
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,450
Okay. Group, we have some
newcomers here today with us.

858
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:42,050
Say hello to Scott
and his father Mister...

859
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:43,450
Avil?

860
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:44,370
Evil.

861
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:45,850
Actually...

862
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:50,450
Doctor Evil.

863
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:52,890
Hello, Dr. Evil.

864
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,050
Hello, Scott.

865
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,450
Hello, everybody.

866
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:57,770
So, Scott, why don't
we start with you?

867
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,050
What brings you here
with us today?

868
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:03,850
Well, I just really met my dad
for the first time 5 days ago.

869
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:06,330
I was partially
frozen his whole life.

870
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:10,570
That is beautiful that
you can admit to that.

871
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:13,850
He comes back and... and now he wants
me to take over the family business.

872
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:17,450
But, Scott, who's gonna
take over the world when I die?

873
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:18,650
Listen to the words he used:

874
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:21,610
"Who's going to take over
the world when I die?"

875
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:24,650
It feels like that to some
of us sometimes, doesn't it?

876
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:25,650
Mhm. Mhm. Yes. Yes.

877
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:28,650
So, what do you want to do, Scott?

878
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:31,850
I don't know. I was
thinking I like animals.

879
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,050
Maybe I'd be a vet.

880
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,250
An evil vet?

881
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:35,650
No.

882
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,250
Maybe like work in a petting zoo.

883
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:38,770
An evil petting zoo?

884
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,650
You always do that!

885
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:43,050
What? What? I...

886
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:45,450
I just think like he hates me.

887
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,450
I really think
he wants to kill me.

888
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:48,450
Now, Scott

889
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,450
we don't want to
kill each other in here.

890
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:54,650
We might say that we
do sometimes but we really don't.

891
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:56,850
Actually, the
boy's quite astute.

892
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:00,850
I really am trying to kill him,
but, so far, unsuccessfully.

893
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:03,050
He's quite wily,
like his old man.

894
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,250
This is what I'm talking about.

895
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:10,650
Okay. Well. We've
heard from you, Scott.

896
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:14,050
Now er... you tell us
a little about yourself.

897
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:17,650
The details of my life
are quite inconsequential.

898
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:21,170
Oh, no. Please, please.
Let... Let's hear about your childhood.

899
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:23,850
Yeah. Come on. Come on.

900
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:28,050
Very well. Where do I begin?

901
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:33,050
My father was a relentlessly self-improving
boulangerie owner from Belgium...

902
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:36,490
with low-grade narcolepsy
and a penchant for buggery.

903
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:41,450
My mother was a 15-year-old French
prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet.

904
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,850
My father would womanize,
he would drink.

905
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:49,050
He would make outrageous claims
like he invented the question mark.

906
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:52,650
Sometimes he would accuse
chestnuts of being lazy...

907
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:58,890
the sort of general malaise that only the
genius possess and the insane lament.

908
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,610
My childhood was typical...

909
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:05,250
summers in Rangoon,
luge lessons.

910
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,850
In the spring, we'd
make meat helmets.

911
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:12,250
When I was insolent I was placed in
a burlap bag and beaten with reeds.

912
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:14,410
Pretty standard, really.

913
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:17,450
At the age of 12,
I received my first scribe.

914
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:20,650
At the age of 14,
a Zoroastrian named Vilma...

915
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:23,450
ritualistically
shaved my testicles.

916
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,650
There really is nothing
like a shorn scrotum.

917
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,570
It's breathtaking.
I suggest you try it.

918
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:32,050
You know, we have to stop.

919
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:34,650
Austin, can I
have a word with you?

920
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:35,850
Of course you may, luv.

921
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,050
Look, I know I'm being neurotic, but...

922
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:44,850
I can't shake off this suspicious
feeling about that Italian secretary.

923
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,170
You know, Miss Fagina.

924
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:48,650
And I don't want
to sound paranoid but...

925
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:51,250
I've had some bad
relationships in the past and...

926
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,650
I have been known
to be jealous.

927
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:54,570
I'm sorry.

928
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,650
No, don't be sorry, baby.

929
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,650
You're right to be suspicious.

930
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:00,250
I shagged her.

931
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:01,450
What?

932
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:03,930
I shagged her rotten,
baby! Yeah!

933
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:07,650
I don't believe you, Austin.
She was repellent.

934
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:09,850
Saucer of milk, table two.

935
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:11,650
But did you use protection?

936
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,770
'Course. I had
my nine-millimeter automatic.

937
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,690
You know I meant
did you use a condom?

938
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:21,250
No. Only sailors
use condoms, baby.

939
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:22,930
Not in the nineties, Austin.

940
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:25,850
Well, they should, those filthy beggars.
They go from port to port.

941
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,650
What? Vanessa,
don't have a thrombo.

942
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,770
Alotta meant nothing to me.

943
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,450
Well, it means something to me.

944
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:34,450
Austin, if you want us
to have a relationship...

945
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,770
you have to get it into your
head that times have changed.

946
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:40,050
You can't just go off
shagging anybody anymore.

947
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:42,970
And if you could, I wouldn't,
because I'm not like that.

948
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:44,850
Vanessa!

949
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,850
You're everything to me.

950
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,850
You just don't get it, do you?

951
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,450
Good night, Austin.

952
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:56,450
Welcome to the nineties.

953
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:58,250
You're gonna be very lonely.

954
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,050
Hey! Hey. Check this guy out.

955
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,450
Peace. Peace.

956
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,850
Jimi Hendrix...deceased.

957
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,450
Drugs.

958
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:37,250
Janis Joplin.

959
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,250
Deceased.

960
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:40,250
Alcohol.

961
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,450
Mama Cass.

962
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:43,050
Deceased.

963
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,250
Ham sandwich.

964
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:13,170
Alright. That's great.
Is the lighting halfway decent?

965
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:15,130
Yes, indeed.
They got the flag up now.

966
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:16,850
You can see
the stars and stripes.

967
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:18,850
Beautiful. Just beautiful.

968
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,050
-Zugabe!

969
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,650
-Zugabe!

970
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,250
-Zugabe!

971
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:24,650
-Zugabe!
-Good morning, Austin.

972
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:29,650
You know, I sometimes forget
you've missed out on the last 30 years.

973
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,330
Fall of the Berlin Wall...

974
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,770
the first female
British Prime Minister...

975
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:36,450
end of apartheid.

976
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:39,450
Yeah, and I can't believe
Liberace was gay.

977
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:43,450
I mean, women loved him.
I didn't see that one coming. No.

978
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:45,850
The tour is about to begin...

979
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,570
so if you'll please
take your seats...

980
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:51,050
Welcome to Virtucon,
company of the future.

981
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,250
Virtucon is a
leading manufacturer

982
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:55,850
of many items you can find
right in your very own home.

983
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,330
Do you think
she's prettier than me?

984
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:58,330
Who?

985
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:59,690
You know who.

986
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:04,050
Oh, the Italian bird.
No, baby. She's rancid.

987
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:08,570
I think you're shagadelic, baby.
You're switched on. You're smashing.

988
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:12,850
We make steel, petroleum
products and volatile chemicals.

989
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:16,050
But don't worry
about the Italian bird, okay?

990
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:17,850
She's the village bicycle.

991
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:19,850
Everyone's had a ride.

992
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,170
...you're using a
Virtucon product.

993
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:25,450
On your right, you'll notice
a door leading to a restricted area.

994
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:27,450
Only authorized
personnel are allowed...

995
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:28,650
I'll take him.

996
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:30,250
You take her.

997
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,250
Let's go.

998
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:52,850
Ah, er... look, it's a guard.

999
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:55,570
What are we going to do? We don't
look anything like our photo-badges.

1000
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:56,850
Don't worry, baby.

1001
00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:00,650
I learned a mind-control
technique during my travels to India.

1002
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:02,250
I learned it from my Guru.

1003
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,050
The late Guru Shastry.

1004
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:06,050
A chased man who died mysteriously

1005
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:09,050
with disease that had
all the hall marks of syphilis.

1006
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,250
Alright. Watch me.

1007
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:11,850
Hi, folks.

1008
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:12,890
You're entering a restricted zone.

1009
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:15,050
I'm gonna have to see
some identification, please.

1010
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,450
Sure!

1011
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,850
There seems to be
some sort of a problem.

1012
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,850
Everything seems to be in order.

1013
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:31,130
Everything seems to be in order.

1014
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,130
It's fantastic, Austin.
Come on, let's go.

1015
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:39,650
I'm going to go across the street
and get you some orange sherbet.

1016
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:44,850
I'm going to go across the street
and get you some orange sherbet.

1017
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:46,050
Austin, let's go.

1018
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:50,050
Here, have a piece of gum.

1019
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:53,170
Here, have a piece of gum.

1020
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,770
Do you mind if I do?

1021
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:56,250
Austin, let's go now.

1022
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:02,050
It's Bolton.
We've got a problem.

1023
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:03,850
Intruders in the complex.

1024
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:05,650
Intruders in the complex.

1025
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:06,850
Watch out.

1026
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,650
-Halt.
-This way.

1027
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:11,450
Judo chop!

1028
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,050
They're coming!

1029
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,850
Hang on. I'm going to floor it.

1030
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,450
Watch out. Move!

1031
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:20,650
Move! Move!

1032
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,250
Careful, Austin.

1033
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:28,650
NOOOOO!

1034
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:30,250
-Watch out!
-Watch out!

1035
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:33,090
NOOOOO!

1036
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,250
Watch out!

1037
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,650
NOOOOO!

1038
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,690
AAAH!

1039
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:40,650
NAAAH!

1040
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:41,850
NAAAH!

1041
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:50,650
Hello?

1042
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,850
Yes. This is Mrs. Harvin.

1043
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:54,450
Yes.

1044
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:57,850
My husband is a henchman
in Dr. Evil's private army.

1045
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:59,050
What?

1046
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:00,650
Oh my God!

1047
01:01:00,850 --> 01:01:02,650
Thanks for calling.

1048
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:07,050
Hi, Mom.

1049
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:08,850
Sit down, Billy.

1050
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:10,850
I've got some bad news.

1051
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:14,650
Your stepfather was run
over by a steamroller.

1052
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:18,450
But Mom, since Dad left,
Steve's been like a father to me.

1053
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,250
Honey.

1054
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:26,050
People never think how things
effect the family of a henchman.

1055
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,850
Oh, thank goodness
we made it, Austin.

1056
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,450
-Alright, stay very cool, baby.
-Okay.

1057
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:00,250
Mr. Powers.

1058
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,250
Welcome to my underground lair.

1059
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:04,850
You're just in time.

1060
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,650
Enjoy the show.

1061
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:15,450
Gentlemen,
I give you the Vulcan...

1062
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:20,050
the world's most powerful
subterranean drill.

1063
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:22,050
Does that make you horny?

1064
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,650
Not now, Austin.

1065
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:26,450
So powerful, it can penetrate
the earth's crust...

1066
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:31,250
delivering a 50-kiloton nuclear warhead
deep into the liquid hot core of the planet.

1067
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:36,450
Upon detonation, every volcano
on earth will erupt.

1068
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:42,450
It seems we have no choice
but to pay your ransom.

1069
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:45,650
You have my instructions.
Bye-bye.

1070
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:50,850
Check it out, Butt-head.
This chick has three boobs.

1071
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,250
How many butts does she have?

1072
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:04,650
Do you like your
quasi-futuristic clothes, Mr. Powers?

1073
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:06,650
I designed them myself.

1074
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:22,250
Scott!

1075
01:03:22,450 --> 01:03:23,850
Scott, my boy, how are you?

1076
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:25,850
How was your day?

1077
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,570
Well, my friend Sweet Jay took me
in that video arcade in town, right?

1078
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:31,450
And they don't speak English there,
so Jay got into a fight and he's all:

1079
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:34,050
"Hey, quit hassling me 'cause
I don't speak French or whatever."

1080
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:35,850
And then the guy says
something in Paris talk...

1081
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:37,450
and I'm like: "Just back off."

1082
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:38,730
And they're all: "Get out."

1083
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:40,090
And we're like: "Make me."

1084
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,050
It was cool.

1085
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:44,250
Fascinating.

1086
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:46,050
What are your plans
for this evening?

1087
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,250
I thought I'd stay in.

1088
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:49,450
There's a good titty
movie on Skinimax.

1089
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,450
And that's how you'd like
to live your life, is it?

1090
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:53,850
Yeah.

1091
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:56,450
-Pretty much worth.
-What?

1092
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:57,650
Yeah. Okay.

1093
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:00,850
Ow!

1094
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:04,450
Scott...

1095
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:10,250
I want you to meet Daddy's
nemesis Austin Powers.

1096
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:13,250
Are you feeding him?
Why don't you just kill him?

1097
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:15,850
No, Scott. I have an even better idea.

1098
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:18,970
I'm going to place him in
an easily escapable situation...

1099
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:22,050
involving an overly
elaborate and exotic death.

1100
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:24,850
Why don't you
just shoot him now?

1101
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,850
I mean, I'll go get a gun.
We'll shoot him together.

1102
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:29,650
It'll be fun. Bang!
Dead. Done.

1103
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:33,450
One more peep out of you and you are
grounded, mister and I am not joking.

1104
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:38,050
All right. Let's begin.

1105
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:42,250
Dr. Evil, do you really
expect them to pay?

1106
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:44,250
No, Mr. Powers.

1107
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:47,850
I expect them to die.

1108
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,450
Even after they
pay me the money...

1109
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:52,650
I'm still gonna melt
every city on the planet...

1110
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:54,650
with liquid hot magma.

1111
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,650
Release the sharks!

1112
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:01,050
Mr. Powers, you'll notice
that all the sharks...

1113
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,250
have laser beams
attached to their heads.

1114
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:06,250
I figure every creature
deserves a warm meal.

1115
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:11,850
Dr. Evil, it's about the sharks.

1116
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,850
When you were frozen...

1117
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:16,250
they were put on the
endangered species list.

1118
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:20,650
We tried to get some but it would've
taken months to clear up the red tape.

1119
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:24,250
You know, I have one simple request...

1120
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:29,450
and that is to have sharks with frickin'
laser beams attached to their heads!

1121
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:34,450
Now, evidently, my cycloptic colleague
informs me that that can't be done.

1122
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:37,450
Er... Can you remind me
what I pay you people for?

1123
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,690
Honestly, throw me a bone here.

1124
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,650
What do we have?

1125
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,450
Sea bass.

1126
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:48,650
Right.

1127
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:51,850
They are mutated sea bass.

1128
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,850
Really? Are they ill-tempered?

1129
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:55,970
Absolutely.

1130
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:57,850
That's a start.
You know. That's something.

1131
01:05:58,250 --> 01:05:59,050
All right, guard...

1132
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:02,250
begin the unnecessarily
slow-moving dipping mechanism.

1133
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,250
Close the tank!

1134
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:09,650
Why? Are... Aren't you
even gonna watch them?

1135
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:11,050
They could get away.

1136
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:12,850
No, no, no. I'm going
to leave them alone...

1137
01:06:12,930 --> 01:06:14,850
and not actually
witness them dying.

1138
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:16,850
I'm just gonna assume
it all went to plan. What?

1139
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:20,050
I have a gun in my room.

1140
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:21,850
You give me five
seconds, I'll get it.

1141
01:06:21,930 --> 01:06:25,130
I'll come back down here, boom!
I'll blow their brains out.

1142
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:27,050
Scott...

1143
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:29,850
You just don't get it, do you?

1144
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:31,130
You don't.

1145
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:33,850
-It's no hassle.
-Shh!

1146
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:35,050
-But...
-Shh!

1147
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:35,850
-I'm...
-Shh!

1148
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:37,850
-All I'm say...
-Shh!

1149
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,130
-They're gonna get awa...
-Shh!

1150
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:40,250
-I...
-Shh!

1151
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:41,210
-I'm just...
-Shh!

1152
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:41,770
-We...
-Shh!

1153
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:42,250
-We sh...
-Shh!

1154
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:43,450
Knock knock.

1155
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:44,250
-Who's there?
-Shh!

1156
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:46,450
-Look...
Shh!

1157
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:48,850
Let me tell you a little story
about a man named "shh!"

1158
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:49,850
Shh!

1159
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:53,650
Even before you start,
that was a preemptive "shh!"

1160
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:57,050
Just know I have a whole bag
of "shh" with your name on it.

1161
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:03,850
What's your plan?

1162
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:06,650
First, I plan to soil myself...

1163
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,250
then I'm going to regroup
and come up with a new plan.

1164
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:10,650
Any thoughts?

1165
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,450
Wait a minute.

1166
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:15,650
I always have this with me,
just in case.

1167
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:19,450
Okay. I get it. I have bad teeth.

1168
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:23,450
No, Austin. The floss is to
swing ourselves onto the ledge.

1169
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:26,650
Oh. All right. Hold on.

1170
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:32,370
Got it. Okay. Toothpaste. Hello?

1171
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:37,250
Judo chop!

1172
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:40,450
Hang on!

1173
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,050
Judo trip.

1174
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:55,050
No!

1175
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,730
Not a good time
to lose one's head.

1176
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:09,850
Indeed.

1177
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:13,050
That's not the way
to get ahead in life.

1178
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,250
No.

1179
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:17,850
It's a shame he
wasn't more headstrong.

1180
01:08:19,650 --> 01:08:22,250
He'll never be the
head of a major corporation.

1181
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,250
Okay. That'll do.

1182
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:24,250
Okay.

1183
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,650
Help me, guys!

1184
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:34,850
Guys, come on.

1185
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:38,650
Can you believe John Smith
is getting married tomorrow?

1186
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:39,650
I can't.

1187
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:42,250
Where's Smitty anyway? It's... it's...
it's not like him to be late for anything.

1188
01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:43,850
Especially's on stag party.

1189
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:46,450
Well, you know he works
as a henchman for Dr. Evil.

1190
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:48,250
Sometimes they work late.

1191
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:52,050
You know, can I just say
something that may sound a little...

1192
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,250
sappy?

1193
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:55,450
I think it is such a tribute

1194
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:57,250
to our buddy, John Smith,...

1195
01:08:57,450 --> 01:09:00,650
that so many of his friends
showed up to honour him today.

1196
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:02,450
There's a lot of
love in this room.

1197
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:03,650
Hear, hear!

1198
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:07,850
Hi!

1199
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:10,450
I have a phone call
for the John-Smith-party.

1200
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:12,050
Oh. Yeah, I get it.

1201
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,450
He's dead?

1202
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:21,450
Decapitated by an
ill-tempered mutated sea bass?

1203
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:25,450
Yes.

1204
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:26,650
Okay.

1205
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:29,450
What's wrong?

1206
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:32,250
What happened? Was that
John? Is he coming late?

1207
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:36,050
John Smith won't be coming.

1208
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,050
Why not?

1209
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:40,250
He was decapitated by an
ill-tempered mutated sea bass.

1210
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:41,850
Oh my God!

1211
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:43,850
Are you kidding me?

1212
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:45,250
To Smitty!

1213
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,050
To Smitty!

1214
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:53,250
No! What are we gonna do?

1215
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:55,850
Oh! Look. There's an
emergency exit. Go get help.

1216
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:58,450
I'm gonna stay here
and keep an eye on Dr. Evil.

1217
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,650
Okay. I'll hurry back.

1218
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:04,250
Listen, Vanessa.

1219
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,450
Whatever happens,

1220
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:12,650
I want you to know that I feel
really bad about that Italian bird.

1221
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:15,850
What I'm trying to say is...

1222
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:19,450
that if you want me
to be a one-woman man...

1223
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:22,250
well, that's just groovy, baby.

1224
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:25,050
Behave.

1225
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:01,250
Come, everyone.

1226
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:03,850
Let us repair
to the main chamber.

1227
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:07,650
Project Vulcan
is about to begin.

1228
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:14,050
Scott? Don't you want to see
what Daddy does for a living?

1229
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:16,250
-Blow me.
-Excuse me?

1230
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:18,050
Show me.

1231
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:20,650
Okay.

1232
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:33,250
Position the Vulcan.

1233
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,050
Bring in the warhead.

1234
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:18,650
Hello, hello!

1235
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:21,450
Hello, Mr. Powers!

1236
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,650
Care to have a little fun?

1237
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:28,650
No, actually I er...
I have to save the world.

1238
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:40,050
Is it cold in here?

1239
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:58,050
Arm the probe.

1240
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:17,450
No! No! No! I've
got to get Dr. Evil!

1241
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:19,250
I've got to get Dr. Evil!

1242
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:20,050
No! No! No! Er...

1243
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:23,050
Baseball, er... cold showers.

1244
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:24,450
Baseball, cold showers.

1245
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:25,850
Give it up, Mr. Powers.

1246
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:28,450
Margaret Thatcher
naked on a cold day.

1247
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,850
Margaret Thatcher
naked on a cold day.

1248
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:33,050
Gentlemen.

1249
01:13:36,850 --> 01:13:38,650
Let's lock and load.

1250
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:41,450
Right, lads. Alright! Move,
move, move! Let's go!

1251
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,130
-Don't go.
-Stay with us.

1252
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,650
Please don't go.

1253
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:47,730
You can't resist us, Mr. Powers.

1254
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:49,850
You can't resist us, Mr. Powers.

1255
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:52,250
Au contraire, baby.

1256
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:54,450
I think you can't resist me.

1257
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:59,450
~You're the one who
makes me come running~

1258
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:03,450
~You're the sun who
makes me shine~

1259
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:07,450
~When you're around
I'm always laughing~

1260
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:11,050
~I wanna make you mine.~

1261
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:13,450
~I close my eyes~

1262
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:15,850
~and see you before me~

1263
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,450
~I think I would die~

1264
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:19,850
~If you were to ignore me~

1265
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:21,450
~A fool could see~

1266
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:23,850
~just how much I adore you~

1267
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:25,650
~I get down on my knees~

1268
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:28,450
~I do anything for you~

1269
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:33,650
~I don't want anybody else~

1270
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:37,450
~When I think about you
I touch myself~

1271
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:39,650
~Oh, I don't want~

1272
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,650
~anybody else~

1273
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,850
~oh no, oh no, oh no~

1274
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:49,250
~I want you. I don't
want anybody else~

1275
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:51,650
~And when I think about you~

1276
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:54,450
~I touch myself, ooh~

1277
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:02,050
~I don't want anybody else~

1278
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:05,850
~when I think about
you, I touch myself~

1279
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:10,450
~Oh, and I don't
want anybody else~

1280
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:13,850
~When I think about
you, I touch myself~

1281
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:16,050
~I touch myself~

1282
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:17,850
Austin?

1283
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:19,850
Vanessa? Er...

1284
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:21,850
It... it's not what it seems.

1285
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:24,650
At ease, boys.

1286
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:25,850
Likewise.

1287
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:28,450
Vanessa, I can explain.

1288
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:32,050
See, what happened was er...
I broke in trying to get to Dr. Evil.

1289
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:33,650
Then all of a sudden,
the fembots came by...

1290
01:15:33,730 --> 01:15:35,850
and smoke started to come
out of their jumblies.

1291
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:38,850
So I thought I'd work my mojo, right?
To counter their mojo.

1292
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:41,850
We got cross-mojonations, and
their heads started exploding.

1293
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:45,450
You know, that thing, and I ended
up in my knickers here and then...

1294
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:49,450
Okay, Austin. I believe you.

1295
01:15:49,530 --> 01:15:50,650
Now get dressed.

1296
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:52,250
Smashing, baby.

1297
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:54,450
Onward, boys.

1298
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:01,650
Launching the
subterranean probe.

1299
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:08,450
Begin initial
surface penetration.

1300
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:16,650
Subterranean nuclear detonation
in three minutes and counting.

1301
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:27,050
Watch out!

1302
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:31,650
~There's a man~

1303
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:33,650
~who leads a life of danger~
-Right Back!

1304
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:34,250
~who leads a life of danger~

1305
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,450
-Subterranean nuclear detonation in three

1306
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:38,650
~To everyone he meets~
-minutes and counting.

1307
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:41,450
~he stays a stranger~

1308
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:44,450
~With every move he makes~

1309
01:16:44,650 --> 01:16:47,450
~another chance he takes~

1310
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:48,850
~odds are he won't live~

1311
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:49,970
~odds are he won't live~
-Oh, I tripped! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1312
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:51,450
~to see tomorrow.~

1313
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:52,050
~to see tomorrow.~
-Open the frickin' door!

1314
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:53,050
-Open the frickin' door!

1315
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:57,050
~Secret agent man! Secret agent man!~

1316
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:59,250
~Secret agent man! Secret agent man!~
-Probe destruction beginning in...

1317
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:00,970
~They've giving you a number~
-Judo! Judo!

1318
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:01,650
~They've giving you a number~
-Ten!

1319
01:17:01,690 --> 01:17:02,170
~And taken away your name~
-Ten!

1320
01:17:02,210 --> 01:17:03,090
~And taken away your name~
-Nine!

1321
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:04,290
~And taken away your name~
-Eight!

1322
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:05,450
-Seven!

1323
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:07,250
-Six!

1324
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:08,850
-Five!

1325
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:10,250
-Four!

1326
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:11,450
-Three!

1327
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:12,850
-Two!

1328
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,250
-One!

1329
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:18,250
NOOOOO!

1330
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:22,050
Abort.

1331
01:17:22,450 --> 01:17:23,250
Abort.

1332
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:24,650
Abort.

1333
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,050
Abort.

1334
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:27,450
Abort.

1335
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:28,850
Abort.

1336
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:30,850
Now to Dr. Evil.

1337
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,250
Din-din.

1338
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,650
I want chicken, I want liver.

1339
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:39,450
Meow Mix, Meow Mix,
please deliver.

1340
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:42,450
I've got you now, Dr. Evil.

1341
01:17:43,770 --> 01:17:46,170
Well done, Mr. Powers.

1342
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:49,450
We're not so different,
you and I.

1343
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:55,450
However, isn't it ironic,
the very things you stand for...
