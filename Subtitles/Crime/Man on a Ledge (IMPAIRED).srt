00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:26,360
-Yeah. Of course.
-Thanks.

323
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:28,111
Okay. Good. Bye.

324
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:30,656
Mr. Henry is here, sir.

325
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,366
What is it, Ted?

326
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:33,534
There's a problem.

327
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:37,204
-Not today there isn't.
-I've taken care of the planning commission.

328
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,623
It's the councilman.

329
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:45,337
It's too much of a risk
if they tie that money to me.

330
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:50,717
Look. I'II talk to Frank,
see if he has someone who can...

331
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:55,681
David, please.

332
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,352
-What's this?
-It's a gift. I'm sorry.

333
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:03,272
Oh.

334
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,984
You know, when I sold my first building,

335
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:10,279
the bank sent over four hookers,
a pound of cocaine,

336
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:13,031
and then they flew us all to Paris
on their private jet.

337
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:15,284
Now that was a gift.

338
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:20,706
Tell me it's done, Ted. Hmm?

339
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:24,042
Tell me it's done!

340
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,964
Thank you for the watch.

341
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:37,347
He gave me a $100 tip on a $240 tab.
Can you imagine that?

342
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,224
240 bucks for breakfast?

343
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,935
-It is the most important meal of the day.
-Yeah.

344
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:43,437
Anything else unusual you noticed?

345
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:47,774
He's got honest eyes.

346
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,861
-You can tell a lot about a man by his eyes.
-My mother used to always say that.

347
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:53,614
Marcus, get this.
The techies didn't find a single print.

348
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,365
They did the whole place?

349
00:26:56,074 --> 00:26:57,201
A little strange, don't you think?

350
00:26:58,452 --> 00:26:59,494
Tell Mercer.

351
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,455
Yeah, be my pleasure.

352
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,750
(lNDlsTINcT)

353
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:25,187
Hey. You want a smoke?

354
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:27,606
No.

355
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:31,527
-Mr. Walker...
-What?

356
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:35,489
I know you're desperate. I can see that.

357
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:39,660
But I also know this isn't a normal suicide.

358
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,747
I don't know what's going on here.

359
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,668
But I can tell you, these people down here,
they don't care about you.

360
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:50,128
They want you to jump.
That's why they're here.

361
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:51,713
But I do care.

362

JOEY: (OVER RADIO TRANSMITTER)
Nick, can you hear me?

363
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:56,677
Is this thing working yet?

364
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,263
And I'm asking you to help me understand
what's going on.

365
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:02,516
We're here, We're here, We're here.
Just don't freak out.

366
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:10,065
I asked for you, because I needed someone
I could count on.

367
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:13,318
Someone I could trust, 'cause, chances are,
this ain't gonna end well.

368
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:15,571
It doesn't have to be that way.
That's your choice.

369
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:19,741
My choice? My only choice is easy.
All right? To jump or not to jump.

370
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:23,287
-This is gonna come down to your choice.
-I don't understand what that means.

371
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:30,627
You're late!

372
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:32,379
Midtown's totally grid-locked, bro.

373
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:38,635
Yeah. And you're the one person
in Manhattan who knew it would be.

374
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:42,556
You ready?

375
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:45,434
All right, Iet's go.

376
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:50,272
In breaking news, we have just learned
that the negotiating of?cer is Lydia Mercen

377
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:53,150
-Are you kidding me with this?
-As you may recall, she was widely criticized

378
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,985
-for her questionable handling...
-What? It's the news.

379
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:58,113
...of last month 's tragic incident
on the Brooklyn Bridge,

380
00:28:58,197 --> 00:29:00,741
where a young of?cerlost his life.

381
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:03,535
-One has to wonder about her suitability...
-I'm sorry. Roy, turn that off.

382
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,037
I hate this bitch.

383
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,664
Yeah, well, people love a celebrity, right?

384
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:12,669
I don't sleep since that happened.

385
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,298
It replays over and over in my mind.

386
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:21,386
I understand. I'm sorry.

387
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,514
(slGHs)

388
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:30,187
No prints, no name, no credit card.
Who does that, Dougherty?

389
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,189
Obviously somebody with a history, right?

390
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:35,275
Why don't I have the guys
go look at some mug shots?

391
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,277
And you get back to the EDP.

392
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:40,447
The investors are running
about 30 minutes behind.

393
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:44,243
There's a jumper on the building
and traffic's a mess.

394
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,789
Why don't these people
just shoot themselves in the head?

395
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,086
Overnight time looks go down
in two minutes.

396
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:55,587
Would you try and relax?

397
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:59,007
-E verything's in place.
-Yeah? Everything but you.

398
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,009
Angie, grab this.

399
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:05,806
Catch.

400
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,309
How you doing way up there?

401
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:15,858
Hey, Angie. Tell Joey to relax.
I can see his leg shaking from here.

402
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,206
Anyone who creates traffic like this
in Midtown should be shot.

403
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,750
I couldn't agree more, ma'am.

404
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:37,754
Are you hoping hejumps
in time for the morning shows?

405
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:39,590
-No!
-I give him an hour.

406
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:44,219
-I'll take the under.
-Fifty bucks.

407
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:48,682
Make it $100. Let's go.

408
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:10,120
Hey, you see me?

409
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:15,125
Yeah. I gotcha.

410
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:16,627
Don't worry.

411
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:20,672
Everyone's looking at me.

412
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:24,718
They were saying on the news
you're headed for Canada.

413
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,303
It couldn't have gone better.

414
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,847
You could have pulled your punches a little.

415
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:31,725
Yeah? It's been a rough couple years.

416
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:34,603
Tell me about it.

417

00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:45,989

That's all good.

-No.

-You don't have to do this.
-Joey!

No, listen. For me it's family, and for Nick.

-Yeah.
-But you could just walk away.

All right.

431
00:32:50,012 --> 00:32:53,348
Besides, you'd probably screw this up
without me.

432
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:55,267
Don't say that. No one's screwing this up.

433
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,270
I know. I'm just saying.
I got your back, all right?

Last one. Do you mind sharing?

00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:55,220
I can imagine how it must have felt
after that cop jumped.

456
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:59,600
Cops are superstitious.

457
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:02,311
And they would've run from you
like the plague.

Never.

in a hostage negotiation.

You got everyone out.

463

You trusted your instincts. You never quit.
You never gave up.

Why do you know so much about me?

Because you and I have a lot in common.

I don't think you wanna jump.

467

Is there a moment when you can tell

468
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,971
if someone's gonna go off or not?

469

Sometimes you know.

470

Sometimes you can feel them give up.

-Nothing you wanna tell me?
-You're starting to chafe me.

798

You don't wanna know everything.
Nobody does.

The Monarch Diamond was
most recently held by David Englander

808
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:12,284
until it was stolen by Nick Cassidy
the man on the Iedge,

809
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:16,413
who was said to have cut it up
into untraceable pieces and sold it.

810
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:32,221
-It's a circus.
-I don't believe this.

00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:33,931
Oh, man.

812
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,475
Time is running out here, Nick.

813
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:39,603
Tactical's on the scene
and I am tired of being played.

814
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:43,857
How far would you go to take down a man
that stole everything from you? Huh?

815
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:45,484
Your honor.

816
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:49,613
Your family. What would you do?
You'd do whatever it takes.

After I drove him to Chappaqua,
two of his thugs, guys in masks,

818
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:57,246
knocked me out
while he just stood there and smiled.

819
00:58:57,329 --> 00:58:59,081
-The jury didn't believe that, Nick.
-That's right.

820
00:58:59,164 --> 00:59:01,166
And neither did my lavvyer.

821
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:05,045
And I have spent two years
banging my head against a brick wall,

822
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,466
'cause I know that the Monarch
never left his hand.

823
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,094
Why would Englander
steal his own diamond?

824
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:17,349
He lost $30 million to Lehman.
He lost another 20 in the real-estate bust.

825
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:19,184
He was that close to being bankrupt_

826
00:59:19,268 --> 00:59:21,687
-If he needed cash, he could've just sold it.
-No.

827
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:25,858
He wouldn't do that, 'cause he wouldn't
want to be humiliated. He's too damn proud.

828
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:28,819
Two weeks after my conviction,

829
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:31,822
Lloyd's of London sent him a check
for 40 million for a claim.

830
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:34,032
And, poof! He's back.

-Come on!
-Who were the thugs?

833
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:46,753
I don't know.
But I know that Englander only uses cops.

to have everyone turn their back on you.

Same name he checked in under.

And a week after Cassidy went up, Walker
and his car got pulled out of the Hudson.

01:08:12,593 --> 01:08:13,886
I can't yet.

01:08:14,511 --> 01:08:16,555
The whole world knows
who you are now, Nick.

961
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:19,683
You've inspired every reporter
to look into your story.

962
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:22,186
If you're innocent, it'Il come out.

963
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:25,063
And if I go back into custody,
they're gonna kill me.

964
01:08:25,147 --> 01:08:28,108
Nick! Don't leave me hanging here.

Look. Ijust need you to buy me some time.
Trust me.

966

I trusted that cop.

On the bridge.

968
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,041

I was supposed to be relieved,

970

but I stayed on, because I knew.

Only then,

01:08:56,595 --> 01:08:58,013
suddenly I didn't know.

Okay, what do you see?

981
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:36,134
I see a mass of wires

982
01:09:37,302 --> 01:09:38,929
coming out of a circuit board.

983
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:41,348
Okay, now find the main processor.

to take out the sensors.

If you cut the wrong one,
all hell is gonna break loose.

-Don't talk to me right now, okay?

I can now con?rm that the bomb squad
has just arrived on the scene

and tactical units are on their way up
to the roof of the Roosevelt Hotel.

Well, this is the moment
you make your choice. Remember?

It's time to clear the window.

on par with yours.

All right.

but the negotiator. Clear the building.
