Look, I'm on cell.
No names.

167

That was strictly
in-office information.

Ahem. Yeah.

324
04:14:50,428 --> 04:14:52,259
Caller: Isn't it funny?

325
04:14:52,330 --> 04:14:54,560
You hear a phone ring,
and it could be anybody,

326
04:14:54,632 --> 04:14:56,896
but a ringing phone
has to be answered,

327
04:14:56,968 --> 04:14:57,900
doesn't it?

328
04:14:57,969 --> 04:14:59,027
What?

329
04:14:59,103 --> 04:15:01,537
Caller: I hope you realize how
you've hurt my feelings.

330
04:15:01,605 --> 04:15:02,902
Who the fuck is this?

331
04:15:02,974 --> 04:15:05,101
Caller: Don't even think about
leaving that phone booth.

332
04:15:05,176 --> 04:15:06,643
Wrong number, pal.

333
04:15:06,711 --> 04:15:08,338
Caller: It was a perfectly
delicious pizza,

334
04:15:08,412 --> 04:15:09,709
and you're certainly
going to wish

335
04:15:09,780 --> 04:15:10,747
you had accepted it.

336
04:15:10,815 --> 04:15:12,077
I imagine this is part
of the same gag...

337
04:15:12,149 --> 04:15:14,208
The pizza bit.
That was some funny shit.

338
04:15:14,285 --> 04:15:15,217
Caller: Yeah, well,
it's purpose

339
04:15:15,286 --> 04:15:16,378
was to keep
your strength up

340
04:15:16,454 --> 04:15:17,443
for what's coming next.

341
04:15:17,521 --> 04:15:19,250
What's coming next
is I'm hanging up.

342
04:15:19,323 --> 04:15:20,517
Caller:
Oh, no, you won't.

343
04:15:20,591 --> 04:15:22,559
You're going to learn
to obey me.

344
04:15:22,626 --> 04:15:25,094
Obey you?
Who is this?

345
04:15:25,162 --> 04:15:26,220
Caller: Someone who enjoys
watching you.

346
04:15:26,297 --> 04:15:27,286
Watching me?

347
04:15:27,365 --> 04:15:29,799
Caller: Yes, I love the suit
you're wearing today.

348
04:15:29,867 --> 04:15:31,198
The black
on raspberry sorbet.

349
04:15:31,268 --> 04:15:32,235
Very Italian.

350
04:15:32,303 --> 04:15:34,396
Where, uh...

351
04:15:34,472 --> 04:15:35,564
Where are you?

352
04:15:35,639 --> 04:15:37,129
Caller: There are hundreds
of windows out there.

353
04:15:37,208 --> 04:15:39,369
Why don't you
check them out?

354
04:15:39,443 --> 04:15:40,375
Yeah?

355
04:15:44,348 --> 04:15:45,440
So what am I doing now?

356
04:15:45,516 --> 04:15:47,074
Caller: You're scratching your head.

357
04:15:47,151 --> 04:15:49,016
Now you're brushing
your hair back.

Caller: That's
not very nice, Stu.

04:15:54,859 --> 04:15:57,157
Did you call me Stu?

360
04:15:57,228 --> 04:15:59,423
Who's Stu?
I don't know any Stu.

361
04:15:59,497 --> 04:16:01,488
Caller: Why, do you prefer Stuart?

362
04:16:01,565 --> 04:16:03,226
Look, a lot of people
in this neighborhood

363
04:16:03,300 --> 04:16:04,232
know who I am.

Go mind-fuck
some other guy, pal.

04:16:09,407 --> 04:16:11,102
Caller: I know
Pamela McFadden, too.

368
04:16:11,175 --> 04:16:12,608
It's not
in your best interest

369
04:16:12,676 --> 04:16:14,303
to disconnect me.

370
04:16:14,378 --> 04:16:16,312
Someone could get hurt.

371
04:16:16,380 --> 04:16:18,814
Oh, what's
the matter, Stu?

372
04:16:18,883 --> 04:16:22,114
Listen, if you're some
fucked-up failed actor

373
04:16:22,186 --> 04:16:24,017
I wouldn't handle or
some prick intern I fired,

374
04:16:24,088 --> 04:16:26,249
I will hunt you down
and I will crush you.

375
04:16:26,323 --> 04:16:27,950
You will never work
in this town.

All right, trust me.

377
04:16:29,293 --> 04:16:30,317
I can turn people

and I can turn you
into a total fucking loser

already.

put you up to this?

386
04:16:45,242 --> 04:16:48,268
Caller: No. I thought this up
all by myself.

387
04:16:48,345 --> 04:16:49,744
All right, well,
keep thinking.

388
04:16:49,814 --> 04:16:50,781
I'm hanging up.

389
04:16:50,848 --> 04:16:52,281
I'll say hi
to your wife Kelly for you.

390
04:16:52,349 --> 04:16:54,078
Talk to you later.

How can you
get me auditions?

You're not an agent.
You're a publicist.

Of course I'm a publicist,

into the booth.

I don't know what you're
talking about, pal.

call you every day
from a phone booth?

461
04:19:22,651 --> 04:19:25,552
Because
he said it's quiet.

Caller: Pam, that's just stupid.

463

It's because his wife

04:34:20,832 --> 04:34:22,459
You shot me.

963
04:34:22,534 --> 04:34:23,865
It's time you learn, Stu.

964
04:34:23,935 --> 04:34:25,698
Deception can't go
unrewarded.

965
04:34:25,770 --> 04:34:27,533
Stu: Deception?
What fucking deception?

966
04:34:27,606 --> 04:34:29,506
Caller: "Are you in need
of immediate

967
04:34:29,574 --> 04:34:31,542
police or medical
response?"

968
04:34:33,278 --> 04:34:36,372
Shit. You bugged
the fucking booth.

969
04:34:36,448 --> 04:34:38,348
That's how you knew.

970
04:34:38,416 --> 04:34:39,508
That's how you knew
about Pam and me.

971
04:34:39,584 --> 04:34:41,950
Caller: You picked the wrong
person to lie to.

972
04:34:42,020 --> 04:34:43,544
Look, I didn't pick you.

973
04:34:43,622 --> 04:34:45,385
Caller: Right. It must have been
your flashy suit

974
04:34:45,457 --> 04:34:46,719
that attracted me.

975
04:34:46,791 --> 04:34:48,383
I get fucked on account
of my clothes?

976
04:34:48,460 --> 04:34:49,893
Huh? That why you
killed Leon?

977
04:34:49,961 --> 04:34:51,895
I didn't kill Leon because
of the way he was dressed.

978
04:34:51,963 --> 04:34:53,328
Yeah, and those other
2 guys as well, huh?

979
04:34:53,398 --> 04:34:54,558
Did they dress too nice?

980
04:34:54,633 --> 04:34:56,225
You must feel
really expensive

981
04:34:56,301 --> 04:34:57,962
when you
walk out the door.

982
04:34:58,036 --> 04:34:59,060
Stu: Look,
here come the cops.

983
04:34:59,137 --> 04:35:00,263
What are you gonna do?
Go out

984
04:35:00,338 --> 04:35:01,805
in a blaze of glory,
or are you gonna run?

985
04:35:01,873 --> 04:35:03,670
Caller: No, I'm not a coward
like some people I know.

986
04:35:03,742 --> 04:35:05,334
Stu: Look, you can get away
if you run now.

987
04:35:05,410 --> 04:35:06,900
Caller: I suppose you'll
blame me for Leon.

988
04:35:06,978 --> 04:35:08,502
Stu: No, no, no, I'll
confess I shot him

989
04:35:08,580 --> 04:35:09,842
with my fucking phone.

990
04:35:09,915 --> 04:35:11,007
Caller: Well, then I urge you

991
04:35:11,082 --> 04:35:12,640
to keep one thing
in mind, Stu.

992
04:35:12,717 --> 04:35:14,184
Take a look
at your chest.

993
04:35:14,252 --> 04:35:16,015
You saw how accurate
I can be, how lethal.

994
04:35:16,087 --> 04:35:18,055
Stu: You kill me now, and you
give yourself away.

995
04:35:18,123 --> 04:35:19,750
Caller: Not with a silencer.

996
04:35:19,824 --> 04:35:21,883
It would take these guys
the rest of the day

997
04:35:21,960 --> 04:35:23,518
to figure out it wasn't
one of their own men

998
04:35:23,595 --> 04:35:24,527
that did it.

999
04:35:24,596 --> 04:35:25,790
You know you can be
shot 41 times

1000
04:35:25,864 --> 04:35:27,354
for just pulling out
your wallet.

1001
04:35:27,432 --> 04:35:28,865
You in the booth,
throw down your weapon

1002
04:35:28,934 --> 04:35:30,834
and come out
with your hands raised.

1003
04:35:30,902 --> 04:35:31,960
Caller: Ignore him.

1004
04:35:32,037 --> 04:35:33,368
W-What if
they open fire?

1005
04:35:33,438 --> 04:35:35,906
They won't.
Look around you, Stu.

1006
04:35:35,974 --> 04:35:37,805
Do you see the tourists
with the video cameras?

1007
04:35:37,876 --> 04:35:40,470
The ones just hoping
the cops will blow you away

1008
04:35:40,545 --> 04:35:41,807
so they can sell the tape

1009
04:35:41,880 --> 04:35:43,370
to the most gory
police shootouts?

1010
04:35:43,448 --> 04:35:44,540
Don't worry,

1011
04:35:44,616 --> 04:35:46,208
they'll keep the police
on their best behavior.

1012
04:35:46,284 --> 04:35:47,581
So long as you don't take

1013
04:35:47,652 --> 04:35:49,449
what would be interpreted
as a hostile action,

1014
04:35:49,521 --> 04:35:50,886
you should be safe.

1015
04:35:50,956 --> 04:35:52,890
Safe?
You call this safe?

1016
04:35:52,958 --> 04:35:54,550
I got a whole fucking
precinct here

1017
04:35:54,626 --> 04:35:55,888
with guns
pointed my way.

1018
04:35:55,961 --> 04:35:57,895
[Siren Wails]

1019
04:35:57,963 --> 04:36:00,056
Sergeant:
With both hands raised,

1020
04:36:00,131 --> 04:36:03,066
moving slowly,
step out of the booth.

1021
04:36:03,134 --> 04:36:05,227
If we see
any signs of a weapon,

1022
04:36:05,303 --> 04:36:06,497
we will respond.

1023
04:36:06,571 --> 04:36:08,368
You won't because
there isn't any!

1024
04:36:08,440 --> 04:36:10,499
Put down the phone
and raise your hand!

1025
04:36:10,575 --> 04:36:11,507
Look, I can't.

1026
04:36:11,576 --> 04:36:12,770
I'm on
an important call.

1027
04:36:12,844 --> 04:36:14,539
Verify this
information for me.

1028
04:36:14,613 --> 04:36:17,081
The guy in the booth
shot that guy over there

1029
04:36:17,148 --> 04:36:18,581
and stuck around
to make a phone call...

1030
04:36:18,650 --> 04:36:19,810
Is that correct?

1031
04:36:19,884 --> 04:36:21,852
Yeah, yeah, that's what
the hookers are saying.

1032
04:36:21,920 --> 04:36:23,683
All right,
give me the horn.

1033
04:36:26,258 --> 04:36:28,123
Sir!

1034
04:36:28,193 --> 04:36:30,457
I'm ordering you
to fully comply.

1035
04:36:30,528 --> 04:36:31,790
Look, I'm busy.

1036
04:36:31,863 --> 04:36:33,194
All right?
Come back later.

1037
04:36:33,265 --> 04:36:35,392
Caller, Laughing:
Very good, Stu.

1038
04:36:35,467 --> 04:36:36,900
Officer: Step out
of the booth

1039
04:36:36,968 --> 04:36:38,629
and raise your hands.

1040
04:36:38,703 --> 04:36:40,568
I am giving you
an order.

1041
04:36:40,639 --> 04:36:43,267
Caller: I give the orders
here, Stu, don't I?

1042
04:36:43,341 --> 04:36:44,603
This guy's
looking for us

1043
04:36:44,676 --> 04:36:45,870
to kill him,
Captain.

1044
04:36:45,944 --> 04:36:48,435
Suicide by a cop?
That's not gonna happen.

1045
04:36:48,513 --> 04:36:50,105
Get that body
out of here fast.

1046
04:36:50,181 --> 04:36:51,614
Yo, somebody
get the body.

1047
04:36:51,683 --> 04:36:53,082
Tell the ambulance
to get the body.

1048
04:36:53,151 --> 04:36:56,120
Caller: Thousands of people
die every day,

1049
04:36:56,187 --> 04:36:57,779
but you put one dead body

1050
04:36:57,856 --> 04:36:59,483
in the middle
of a busy street,

1051
04:36:59,557 --> 04:37:01,149
and it makes people crazy.

1052
04:37:01,226 --> 04:37:02,557
Look at these guys.

1053
04:37:02,627 --> 04:37:05,391
You can smell the fear.

1054
04:37:05,463 --> 04:37:07,522
Fuck. 10 cops.

1055
04:37:07,599 --> 04:37:09,829
Caller: This reminds me of 'Nam.

1056
04:37:09,901 --> 04:37:11,198
Vietnam?

1057
04:37:11,269 --> 04:37:13,134
Yes, Vietnam.

1058
04:37:13,204 --> 04:37:14,603
I was too young
to go,

1059
04:37:14,673 --> 04:37:16,004
but I've seen
pictures.

1060
04:37:16,074 --> 04:37:18,008
Well, pictures
can't do it, Stu.

1061
04:37:18,076 --> 04:37:20,010
You can't imagine
the fear, the stench,

1062
04:37:20,078 --> 04:37:21,943
pigs eating
Napalm-charred bodies,

1063
04:37:22,013 --> 04:37:23,913
children leaving grenades
in your boots.

1064
04:37:23,982 --> 04:37:25,916
And you got blamed
for the war.

1065
04:37:25,984 --> 04:37:27,952
I came home,
and people spit on me.

1066
04:37:28,019 --> 04:37:29,987
This country
owes you an apology.

1067
04:37:30,055 --> 04:37:32,421
Look, I just had this
vision of you, of a kid,

1068
04:37:32,490 --> 04:37:34,458
coming back
from the war, you know?

1069
04:37:34,526 --> 04:37:35,891
Inured to the killing,

1070
04:37:35,960 --> 04:37:37,552
not able to get work,
isolated.

1071
04:37:37,629 --> 04:37:39,062
I think that
could be made into

1072
04:37:39,130 --> 04:37:40,859
a pretty affecting story

1073
04:37:40,932 --> 04:37:42,832
and, you know, one that
everyone understands.

1074
04:37:42,901 --> 04:37:43,993
And I think cops...

1075
04:37:44,069 --> 04:37:45,696
I think they're on
the side of vets.

1076
04:37:45,770 --> 04:37:47,704
[Laughing]
You are pathetic, Stu.

1077
04:37:47,772 --> 04:37:49,205
Why don't you wake up?

1078
04:37:49,274 --> 04:37:50,866
Napalm-charred bodies?

1079
04:37:50,942 --> 04:37:53,035
I'd have to be 50
to be in that war!

1080
04:37:53,111 --> 04:37:55,102
Look, stop fucking
with my head, please.

1081
04:37:55,180 --> 04:37:56,772
Cover me. I'm going
to go talk to him.

1082
04:37:56,848 --> 04:37:58,372
Shouldn't we wait on
the E.S.U. Negotiator?

1083
04:37:58,450 --> 04:37:59,712
They could take
20 minutes.

1084
04:37:59,784 --> 04:38:01,308
I'm not gonna take
a chance on this one.

1085
04:38:01,386 --> 04:38:03,320
I'm not.
I'm gonna handle this.

1086
04:38:03,388 --> 04:38:06,755
Sir! I'm taking out
my weapon.

1087
04:38:06,825 --> 04:38:09,316
Putting my weapon
down on the car.

1088
04:38:09,394 --> 04:38:11,259
Officer: The captain's going in.

1089
04:38:11,329 --> 04:38:12,455
I'm not armed.

1090
04:38:12,530 --> 04:38:13,895
Yeah, neither am I.

1091
04:38:13,965 --> 04:38:17,332
My name is Ramey.
Captain Ed Ramey.

1092
04:38:17,402 --> 04:38:18,664
What's yours?

1093
04:38:18,737 --> 04:38:19,863
Look, I don't want
to be friends.

1094
04:38:19,938 --> 04:38:21,200
I don't know,

1095
04:38:21,272 --> 04:38:23,172
it looks like you could
use a friend right now.

1096
04:38:23,241 --> 04:38:24,833
Caller: Tell him you've
already got a friend.

1097
04:38:24,909 --> 04:38:26,171
I already
got a friend, okay?

1098
04:38:26,244 --> 04:38:28,303
Is that who you're
talking to on the phone?

1099
04:38:28,380 --> 04:38:29,972
Look, I just want to hear
your side of it.

1100
04:38:30,048 --> 04:38:31,242
That's all.

1101
04:38:31,316 --> 04:38:33,682
I ain't got
no side of it.

1102
04:38:33,752 --> 04:38:35,686
And I didn't
shoot anybody.

1103
04:38:35,754 --> 04:38:37,688
You see a fucking
gun anywhere? Look.

1104
04:38:37,756 --> 04:38:39,087
Felicia: It's in
your back pocket!

1105
04:38:39,157 --> 04:38:41,625
I see it!
He been feeling it!

1106
04:38:41,693 --> 04:38:45,254
Sir, do you have
the weapon in your pocket?

1107
04:38:45,330 --> 04:38:47,821
No. I got a cell phone,
and I got cigarettes.

1108
04:38:47,899 --> 04:38:49,127
I got no fucking weapon.

1109
04:38:49,200 --> 04:38:50,565
Okay. Then what
are you doing

1110
04:38:50,635 --> 04:38:52,034
in a phone booth
making calls?

1111
04:38:52,103 --> 04:38:54,094
Look, you want
to see it? Here...

1112
04:38:54,172 --> 04:38:55,935
Hey! Don't reach
for that!

1113
04:38:56,007 --> 04:38:57,565
- Hold your fire!
- Jesus.

1114
04:38:57,642 --> 04:38:59,166
I don't need
to see it.

1115
04:38:59,244 --> 04:39:00,575
I already know
it's there.

1116
04:39:00,645 --> 04:39:01,976
I got plenty
of witnesses over here

1117
04:39:02,046 --> 04:39:03,411
who saw you use it.

1118
04:39:03,481 --> 04:39:05,506
Look, they didn't see it
because it didn't happen!

1119
04:39:05,583 --> 04:39:06,777
Shut them up!

1120
04:39:06,851 --> 04:39:09,115
He's dead,
but it didn't happen.

1121
04:39:09,187 --> 04:39:10,745
Then who did it?

1122
04:39:10,822 --> 04:39:12,449
Caller:
Mustn't tell him, Stu.

1123
04:39:12,524 --> 04:39:13,957
I don't know.

1124
04:39:14,025 --> 04:39:15,617
Hey, you were
the closest one to him.

1125
04:39:15,693 --> 04:39:16,955
You must've saw it happen.

1126
04:39:17,028 --> 04:39:18,290
Come on,
help me out here.

1127
04:39:18,363 --> 04:39:20,126
Caller: This guy is
getting on my nerves.

1128
04:39:20,198 --> 04:39:21,631
Look, stay the fuck
out of this.

1129
04:39:21,699 --> 04:39:23,758
Who do you keep
talking to on the phone?

1130
04:39:23,835 --> 04:39:25,166
Nobody.

1131
04:39:25,236 --> 04:39:27,966
Your friend, your parent,
your lover... who?

1132
04:39:28,039 --> 04:39:30,337
Caller: Careful, Stuart, careful.

1133
04:39:30,408 --> 04:39:31,841
My psychiatrist.

1134
04:39:31,910 --> 04:39:33,844
[Caller, Laughing] Excellent.

1135
04:39:33,912 --> 04:39:35,345
I should have
thought of that.

1136
04:39:35,413 --> 04:39:37,608
I see. What's this
doctor's name?

1137
04:39:37,682 --> 04:39:39,650
It would be really helpful
to us if we knew that.

1138
04:39:39,717 --> 04:39:41,776
He says
not to tell you.

1139
04:39:41,853 --> 04:39:43,684
It's privileged
information.

1140
04:39:43,755 --> 04:39:46,121
Very good, Stuart.
See, now you're having fun.

1141
04:39:46,191 --> 04:39:47,624
Yeah, whatever
you fucking say.

1142
04:39:47,692 --> 04:39:49,751
Ramey: I respect your
right to privacy.

1143
04:39:49,828 --> 04:39:51,352
I've been through
therapy myself.

1144
04:39:51,429 --> 04:39:53,021
The department...
they provided it for me.

1145
04:39:53,097 --> 04:39:55,657
I know it's not good form
for a cop to be saying that,

1146
04:39:55,733 --> 04:39:57,997
but you know, sometimes,
hey, the circumstances...

1147
04:39:58,069 --> 04:39:59,764
Stress... I had issues.

1148
04:39:59,838 --> 04:40:01,396
I lost my marriage
over it.

1149
04:40:01,473 --> 04:40:04,237
Caller: Tell him not to come
any closer.

1150
04:40:04,309 --> 04:40:05,776
Stu: Look, don't come
any closer.

1151
04:40:05,844 --> 04:40:07,471
Stop right there.
Go back a few steps.

1152
04:40:07,545 --> 04:40:09,137
Go back
to where you were.

1153
04:40:09,214 --> 04:40:10,647
Okay, okay.
Hey, no problem.

1154
04:40:10,715 --> 04:40:13,479
So you got some
intimacy issues.

1155
04:40:13,551 --> 04:40:14,984
I got those, too.

1156
04:40:15,053 --> 04:40:17,647
All I want to know is,
what happened, man?

1157
04:40:17,722 --> 04:40:19,519
Caller: Tell him to read you
your rights.

1158
04:40:19,591 --> 04:40:21,752
I want you to
read me my rights.

1159
04:40:21,826 --> 04:40:23,589
And stop asking
questions.

1160
04:40:23,661 --> 04:40:25,561
You have the right
to remain silent.

1161
04:40:25,630 --> 04:40:27,359
You have the right
to an attorney.

1162
04:40:27,432 --> 04:40:28,694
If you cannot afford one,

1163
04:40:28,766 --> 04:40:30,290
an attorney will be
provided for you.

1164
04:40:30,368 --> 04:40:32,131
All right?

1165
04:40:32,203 --> 04:40:34,831
So now, can you at least
give me your first name?

1166
04:40:34,906 --> 04:40:36,032
Just your first name.

1167
04:40:36,107 --> 04:40:37,335
Caller: Don't tell him.

1168
04:40:37,408 --> 04:40:39,171
It's my right not to
have any first name.

1169
04:40:39,244 --> 04:40:40,836
[Caller Laughing]

1170
04:40:40,912 --> 04:40:41,844
Ramey: No gun, no name.

1171
04:40:41,913 --> 04:40:43,005
Stu: That's right.

1172
04:40:43,081 --> 04:40:45,174
You're a highly
underprivileged person, sir.

1173
04:40:45,250 --> 04:40:46,842
Caller: Demand your lawyer.

1174
04:40:46,918 --> 04:40:48,852
And go get
my lawyer, too.

1175
04:40:48,920 --> 04:40:50,945
I want an attorney
brought down here

1176
04:40:51,022 --> 04:40:52,284
to negotiate
my surrender.

1177
04:40:52,357 --> 04:40:53,619
Caller: Just brilliant, Stu.

1178
04:40:53,691 --> 04:40:54,783
I understand that,
but, uh,

1179
04:40:54,859 --> 04:40:56,121
it's gonna be
very difficult

1180
04:40:56,194 --> 04:40:57,456
to get a lawyer
to come down here

1181
04:40:57,529 --> 04:40:58,553
and risk his life,

1182
04:40:58,630 --> 04:40:59,790
but once you
hand over the gun...

1183
04:40:59,864 --> 04:41:01,525
How can I hand over
the fucking weapon when

1184
04:41:01,599 --> 04:41:03,191
you won't let me put
my hand in my pocket?

1185
04:41:03,268 --> 04:41:04,860
Oh, no, we'll
take it out for you.

1186
04:41:04,936 --> 04:41:07,302
All you have to do is just
step out of the booth

1187
04:41:07,372 --> 04:41:09,567
with your hands raised...
nothing will happen to you.

1188
04:41:09,641 --> 04:41:11,302
It's not gonna work.

1189
04:41:11,376 --> 04:41:12,502
Caller: Stu, Stu, please.

1190
04:41:12,577 --> 04:41:13,601
What?

1191
04:41:13,678 --> 04:41:15,111
Ask him a question for me.

1192
04:41:15,179 --> 04:41:17,477
Ask him if his wife got
tired of sleeping with him?

1193
04:41:17,549 --> 04:41:19,210
I, uh... fuck.

1194
04:41:19,284 --> 04:41:20,751
I can't do that.

1195
04:41:20,818 --> 04:41:22,080
Oh, sure you can, Stu.

1196
04:41:22,153 --> 04:41:23,677
Ask him if
he couldn't get it up,

1197
04:41:23,755 --> 04:41:25,017
if he couldn't
satisfy her.

1198
04:41:25,089 --> 04:41:27,148
Sir, are you going
to step out of the booth?

1199
04:41:27,225 --> 04:41:28,852
- I can't... No.
- Ramey: Is that a "no"?

1200
04:41:28,927 --> 04:41:30,519
You're not stepping out
of the booth?

1201
04:41:30,595 --> 04:41:31,619
Caller: Ask him.

1202
04:41:31,696 --> 04:41:32,924
Is that a "no"?

1203
04:41:32,997 --> 04:41:33,986
Caller: Ask him!

1204
04:41:35,567 --> 04:41:37,364
Both your lives
depend on it.

1205
04:41:37,435 --> 04:41:38,527
Sir?

1206
04:41:38,603 --> 04:41:41,868
Captain, you, uh,

1207
04:41:41,940 --> 04:41:44,204
you couldn't satisfy
your wife sexually?

1208
04:41:44,275 --> 04:41:46,470
[Caller Laughing]

1209
04:41:48,513 --> 04:41:49,673
Excuse me?

1210
04:41:49,747 --> 04:41:51,772
Caller: Ask him if he abuses himself
now that she's gone.

1211
04:41:51,849 --> 04:41:53,646
Does he masturbate
on those lonely nights?

1212
04:41:53,718 --> 04:41:54,844
For God's sake!

1213
04:41:54,919 --> 04:41:56,546
Caller: Say it!

1214
04:41:56,621 --> 04:41:59,454
Say it or I will
blow him away!

1215
04:41:59,524 --> 04:42:01,355
[Gun Cocking]

1216
04:42:01,426 --> 04:42:03,792
So do you
wack off now?

1217
04:42:03,861 --> 04:42:04,828
Hey!

1218
04:42:04,896 --> 04:42:07,057
[Caller Laughing]

1219
04:42:09,267 --> 04:42:12,361
I'm going to see about
that lawyer for you, okay?

1220
04:42:12,437 --> 04:42:13,734
Yes.

1221
04:42:13,805 --> 04:42:15,238
Just relax.

1222
04:42:16,908 --> 04:42:19,741
Caller: Stu, I think
you hurt his feelings.

1223
04:42:19,811 --> 04:42:21,608
I want to know who he's
on that phone with.

1224
04:42:21,679 --> 04:42:22,805
I want a techie here.

1225
04:42:22,880 --> 04:42:25,747
I need to talk to somebody
about that phone.

1226
04:42:25,817 --> 04:42:27,751
Caller: Do you think we went
too far, Stuart?

1227
04:42:27,819 --> 04:42:29,514
Should we
give ourselves up?

1228
04:42:29,587 --> 04:42:30,849
You know,
maybe I'd like someone

1229
04:42:30,922 --> 04:42:32,253
to negotiate
my surrender, too.

1230
04:42:32,323 --> 04:42:33,756
Look, I'm sure we
can work that out.

1231
04:42:33,825 --> 04:42:35,759
Well, I don't want to just
spill my guts to anyone.

1232
04:42:35,827 --> 04:42:37,317
Could you get me
national news?

1233
04:42:37,395 --> 04:42:39,329
I mean, you've got
connections, right?

1234
04:42:39,397 --> 04:42:40,523
Sure.

1235
04:42:40,598 --> 04:42:42,657
Larry King? Could you get
Larry King down here?

1236
04:42:42,734 --> 04:42:44,326
Larry... why the fuck
would Larry King

1237
04:42:44,402 --> 04:42:45,334
come down here?

1238
04:42:45,403 --> 04:42:46,335
Because you're friends.

1239
04:42:46,404 --> 04:42:47,996
Who else
could you get, huh?

1240
04:42:48,072 --> 04:42:49,835
Could you get
Tom Brokaw?

1241
04:42:49,907 --> 04:42:51,841
How 'bout Dan Rather?
Diane Sawyer?

1242
04:42:51,909 --> 04:42:53,843
Look, l... I don't know.
They're busy.

1243
04:42:53,911 --> 04:42:55,401
"I... I... I... busy."

1244
04:42:55,480 --> 04:42:57,345
How 'bout Mike Wallace,
Ted Koppel?

1245
04:42:57,415 --> 04:42:58,973
PeterJennings,
Katie Couric,

1246
04:42:59,050 --> 04:43:00,312
Al Roker, anybody?

1247
04:43:00,385 --> 04:43:02,182
Nah! Nobody.

1248
04:43:02,253 --> 04:43:04,721
Face it, Stu,
you're small-time,

1249
04:43:04,789 --> 04:43:06,848
and you've got
a credibility problem.

1250
04:43:06,924 --> 04:43:08,186
Listen,
don't fucking worry

1251
04:43:08,259 --> 04:43:09,590
about my credibility,
all right?

1252
04:43:09,661 --> 04:43:10,923
What about yours?

1253
04:43:10,995 --> 04:43:12,826
[Laughing]
Look, it's our friends

1254
04:43:12,897 --> 04:43:14,888
from channels 2 and 5.

1255
04:43:14,966 --> 04:43:16,661
You're local news,
Stuart.

1256
04:43:16,734 --> 04:43:18,861
You could never do this
for any of your clients,

1257
04:43:18,936 --> 04:43:20,528
not if your life
depended on it,

1258
04:43:20,605 --> 04:43:22,436
but me,
I've made you famous.

1259
04:43:22,507 --> 04:43:23,872
Stick your head out
a little

1260
04:43:23,941 --> 04:43:25,533
so they can get
a better angle on you.

1261
04:43:25,610 --> 04:43:27,043
They're here
for coverage of me

1262
04:43:27,111 --> 04:43:28,203
dying in the gutter.

1263
04:43:28,279 --> 04:43:29,371
Caller: How ungrateful.

1264
04:43:29,447 --> 04:43:30,880
Those cameras
will make the police

1265
04:43:30,948 --> 04:43:32,540
very careful, Stuart,
so come on,

1266
04:43:32,617 --> 04:43:33,982
smile a little for them.

1267
04:43:34,052 --> 04:43:35,644
Can you tap into
that phone call?

1268
04:43:35,720 --> 04:43:36,948
Should be no problem.

1269
04:43:37,021 --> 04:43:38,454
Except we'll need
a warrant

1270
04:43:38,523 --> 04:43:40,115
if he's on the line
with his shrink.

1271
04:43:40,191 --> 04:43:42,386
Fuck that, I'm not
gonna jeopardize this

1272
04:43:42,460 --> 04:43:43,893
on a technicality.

1273
04:43:43,961 --> 04:43:45,223
Look, tracing...

1274

That's not
a violation, right?

As long as we
don't listen in.

1276

Okay, this is what
I want you to do.

1277

I want you to find out
who he's talking to

location.

04:43:53,471 --> 04:43:54,403
All right.

1280
04:43:54,472 --> 04:43:55,564
We get that,

1281
04:43:55,640 --> 04:43:57,073
I want somebody
to get over there

1282
04:43:57,141 --> 04:43:58,836
and find out what
the hell is going on.

Caller: Look across the street

and see what everybody
in New York is looking at.

1285

You're the man, Stuart.

1286

You're the center
of attention.

goes national.

You're gonna hit
the whole alphabet, Stu.

Listen, I'll be

1291

in a week.

1292
04:44:16,094 --> 04:44:18,028
No one ever remembers
the name of the victims.

1293
04:44:18,096 --> 04:44:19,358
It's the killers
that get the cover

1294
04:44:19,430 --> 04:44:20,863
of <i>Time</i> magazine.

Name a victim.
You can't.

1300
04:44:29,574 --> 04:44:30,939
And anyway,
I don't deserve to be

1301
04:44:31,008 --> 04:44:32,270
the center of attention.

1302
04:44:32,343 --> 04:44:33,776
It ought to be you
they're covering.

1303
04:44:33,845 --> 04:44:35,779
No, all that attention
would embarrass me.

1304
04:44:35,847 --> 04:44:37,678
I know exactly the spin
to put on this.

How your terror inspires
your creativity?

still wanted him.

1309
04:44:45,890 --> 04:44:47,881
See, that approach
seems predicated

1310
04:44:47,959 --> 04:44:50,393
upon me surrendering myself
without killing you.

1311
04:44:50,461 --> 04:44:52,053
No.

1312

Get America
on your side.

1316
04:45:00,404 --> 04:45:02,338
Right, you killed Leon

1317
04:45:02,406 --> 04:45:04,340
because he was gonna
kill me.

1318

You killed Leon
to protect me.

1319

All right? Now,
in a city where nobody

looks out for anybody,
you took a stand.

I'm your best witness
to that.

1322
04:45:12,416 --> 04:45:15,317
So you want me to trust you
to get me out of this?

Y-Yes, I do.
I want you to trust me.

I'm crazy.

Hey, you should've
waited for me

to initiate contact
with the suspect.

1330

I already established
some rapport with him.

1331
04:45:42,380 --> 04:45:43,711
I'll let you know
if I need any help, okay?

What, are you grandstanding
for these TV cameras?

You want to leave this
to a professional.

gets here,

in the lobby over here.

And give me
5 sharpshooters up here.

under the circumstances,

whether your husband

you thought he was,

[Caller Chuckles]

1745
04:59:02,584 --> 04:59:04,711
Why would you do that?

1746
04:59:04,786 --> 04:59:07,414
Because it's fun.

1747
04:59:07,489 --> 04:59:09,389
The odds are even now,
Stuart.

1748
04:59:09,458 --> 04:59:11,426
Isn't that what you wanted?

1749
04:59:11,493 --> 04:59:14,291
You know where I am,
and you have a gun.

1750
04:59:14,363 --> 04:59:17,594
If you have it in you,
you can take me down.

1751
04:59:20,802 --> 04:59:22,963
Fuck.
They'd kill me

1752
04:59:23,038 --> 04:59:24,505
before I got off
a shot, you...

1753
04:59:24,573 --> 04:59:26,666
Caller: Aw, you're probably right.

1754
04:59:26,742 --> 04:59:28,232
I'm not really there anyway.

1755
04:59:28,310 --> 04:59:31,040
You would've just spoiled
some nice lady's curtains.

1756
04:59:35,951 --> 04:59:39,216
Looks like someone
watches the news.

1757
04:59:39,288 --> 04:59:40,812
[Caller Chuckles]

1758
04:59:40,889 --> 04:59:41,821
Stu: Who?

1759
04:59:41,890 --> 04:59:44,358
Caller: The motel.

1760
04:59:46,528 --> 04:59:47,460
Oh, God.

1761
04:59:47,529 --> 04:59:48,723
I think she could use
a new head shot.

1762
04:59:48,797 --> 04:59:49,729
Don't!

1763
04:59:49,798 --> 04:59:51,698
Then take down the gun!

1764
04:59:51,767 --> 04:59:53,462
But this has nothing
to do with her.

1765
04:59:53,535 --> 04:59:55,730
She has everything
to do with this, Stuart.

1766
04:59:55,804 --> 04:59:57,203
You're here
because you called her.

1767
04:59:57,272 --> 04:59:58,796
She's here
because you called her.

1768
04:59:58,874 --> 05:00:00,136
Now, take it down!

1769
05:00:01,677 --> 05:00:02,939
Don't make me
hurt Pam, Stuart.

1770
05:00:03,011 --> 05:00:04,774
Take down the gun.

1771
05:00:04,846 --> 05:00:06,473
Sgt. Cole:
Everybody get ready.

1772
05:00:06,548 --> 05:00:07,572
Hold on. Let's just see
what he does, all right?

1773
05:00:07,649 --> 05:00:09,879
Let's just see what
he's doing. Hold on.

1774
05:00:14,089 --> 05:00:15,078
There's nothing there.

1775
05:00:15,157 --> 05:00:16,784
Caller: Nothing
but your fingerprints

1776
05:00:16,858 --> 05:00:19,588
on the finest cop-killer
money can buy.

1777
05:00:19,661 --> 05:00:20,992
Come on, Stu.

1778
05:00:21,063 --> 05:00:22,189
Let's see it.

1779
05:00:22,264 --> 05:00:23,891
Fuck, no.
It's staying there.

1780
05:00:23,966 --> 05:00:26,594
Fine, then someone will
have to take your place.

1781
05:00:26,668 --> 05:00:28,568
Come on, Stu! You're in
a perfect position!

1782
05:00:28,637 --> 05:00:29,569
How do you
figure?

1783
05:00:29,638 --> 05:00:30,696
You get to choose
between them...

1784
05:00:30,772 --> 05:00:32,569
Pamela or Kelly,
or should I choose for you?

1785
05:00:32,641 --> 05:00:36,270
One of them
can take your place.

1786
05:00:36,345 --> 05:00:38,006
Don't do this!

1787
05:00:38,080 --> 05:00:39,104
Stuart,
you've got to be

1788
05:00:39,181 --> 05:00:40,307
more in touch
with your feelings.

1789
05:00:40,382 --> 05:00:41,974
I thought
you only loved Kelly.

1790
05:00:42,050 --> 05:00:42,982
It's true.

1791
05:00:43,051 --> 05:00:44,279
But you lie to her.

1792
05:00:44,353 --> 05:00:45,843
It... It's complicated.

1793
05:00:45,921 --> 05:00:47,252
Then I'll uncomplicate it,
Stuart,

1794
05:00:47,322 --> 05:00:48,254
by removing temptation!

1795
05:00:48,323 --> 05:00:49,654
I say Pam.

1796
05:00:49,725 --> 05:00:51,352
No! Look,
this isn't Pam's fault.

1797
05:00:51,426 --> 05:00:53,792
This is all my fault.
She's... She's innocent.

1798
05:00:53,862 --> 05:00:57,628
Oh. Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Time's running out.

1799
05:00:57,699 --> 05:00:59,166
Okay, Kelly, then.
You decide.

1800
05:00:59,234 --> 05:01:00,929
No! Please!

1801
05:01:01,003 --> 05:01:02,664
Come on, Stu!

1802
05:01:02,738 --> 05:01:03,864
Don't you get the game yet?

1803
05:01:03,939 --> 05:01:06,775
You're a selfish guy.
Pick one and save yourself.

1804
05:01:06,775 --> 05:01:07,298
You're a selfish guy.
Pick one and save yourself.

1805
05:01:07,376 --> 05:01:08,343
Blonde or brunette?

1806
05:01:08,410 --> 05:01:10,139
Time's running out.

1807
05:01:10,212 --> 05:01:12,112
You or them?
Kelly or Pam?

1808
05:01:12,180 --> 05:01:14,273
Kelly or Pam?
Kelly or Pam?

1809
05:01:14,349 --> 05:01:16,647
Come on, Stu.

1810
05:01:16,718 --> 05:01:19,278
Stop this.

1811
05:01:19,354 --> 05:01:20,753
I can't take this
anymore.

1812
05:01:20,822 --> 05:01:22,619
What are you doing?
Get up.

1813
05:01:22,691 --> 05:01:24,249
I was looking
for my ring.

1814
05:01:24,326 --> 05:01:25,350
Get up, Stuart!

1815
05:01:25,427 --> 05:01:26,359
L... l...

1816
05:01:26,428 --> 05:01:27,360
Stand up and be a man!

1817
05:01:27,429 --> 05:01:29,920
You're embarrassing
yourself!

1818
05:01:32,768 --> 05:01:34,235
Captain, yeah,
I got it.

1819
05:01:34,302 --> 05:01:35,564
The rifleman on
the east side of the street

1820
05:01:35,637 --> 05:01:38,265
reports the subject pulled
a small, dark object

1821
05:01:38,340 --> 05:01:39,432
out of his pants pocket.

1822
05:01:39,508 --> 05:01:41,032
All right. You're
lookin' at a suicide

1823
05:01:41,109 --> 05:01:42,542
now on national
fuckin' TV.

1824
05:01:42,611 --> 05:01:44,238
You gonna let me take
this over, Captain?

1825
05:01:44,312 --> 05:01:45,802
Tell everybody
to hold on, all right?

1826
05:01:45,881 --> 05:01:47,041
Tell everybody to
hold their fire.

1827
05:01:47,115 --> 05:01:49,015
Everybody hold.
Stay ready, but hold.

1828
05:01:50,285 --> 05:01:52,583
Caller: Stuart, you're
beginning to annoy me.

1829
05:01:52,654 --> 05:01:55,885
Y-Y-You can't do this.

1830
05:01:55,957 --> 05:01:59,825
Caller: Stu, no more spinning,
no more excuses.

1831
05:02:01,763 --> 05:02:03,697
Oh, what are you doing?
Look, listen.

1832
05:02:03,765 --> 05:02:05,096
Listen,
please listen to me.

1833
05:02:05,167 --> 05:02:06,600
Caller: No more delays, Stuart.

1834
05:02:06,668 --> 05:02:09,159
L... l... I'm on my knees
begging you not to kill me.

1835
05:02:09,237 --> 05:02:11,637
Well, I will if you keep up
this pathetic spectacle.

1836
05:02:13,608 --> 05:02:15,405
Hey, look, from up
in your high window,

1837
05:02:15,477 --> 05:02:16,705
you could kill anyone
on the street.

1838
05:02:16,778 --> 05:02:17,710
Caller: Yes, I know that, Stu.

1839
05:02:17,779 --> 05:02:19,713
And, uh...

1840
05:02:19,781 --> 05:02:21,442
y-you can pick off
any of the cops like Ramey

1841
05:02:21,516 --> 05:02:22,448
with your rifle.

1842
05:02:22,517 --> 05:02:24,212
Shut up and stand up!

1843
05:02:24,286 --> 05:02:25,844
Look,
why threaten Kelly?

1844
05:02:25,921 --> 05:02:27,616
You said you liked
how she sounded

1845
05:02:27,689 --> 05:02:28,917
on the phone
at the store.

1846
05:02:28,990 --> 05:02:29,922
Please don't hurt her.

1847
05:02:29,991 --> 05:02:31,720
Please don't fuckin' hurt
my wife.

1848
05:02:31,793 --> 05:02:33,351
This doesn't have to end
with me shooting you,

1849
05:02:33,428 --> 05:02:34,725
but you're leaving me
no choice.

1850
05:02:34,796 --> 05:02:36,229
Now get up!

1851
05:02:38,300 --> 05:02:39,733
Okay, how does this end?

1852
05:02:39,801 --> 05:02:41,860
Tell me how this ends.

1853
05:02:41,937 --> 05:02:43,905
Caller: The stage is almost set.

1854
05:02:43,972 --> 05:02:45,303
People are gonna be
eating dinner

1855
05:02:45,373 --> 05:02:47,204
watching you die.

1856
05:02:47,275 --> 05:02:49,038
We got a sniper
situation here.

1857
05:02:50,545 --> 05:02:52,035
What about that
phone call earlier

1858
05:02:52,114 --> 05:02:53,274
to your store?

1859
05:02:53,348 --> 05:02:55,213
I got a phone call
this afternoon from somebody.

1860
05:02:55,283 --> 05:02:56,511
I think
it was a prank call.

1861
05:02:56,585 --> 05:02:58,951
He told me Stu would be
calling me from a phone booth.

1862
05:02:59,020 --> 05:03:00,078
How long will it take to
bring up a record

1863
05:03:00,155 --> 05:03:01,486
of Mrs. Shepard's
incoming calls?

1864
05:03:01,556 --> 05:03:02,750
If he's using
that secure line,

1865
05:03:02,824 --> 05:03:04,451
we won't know anything
more than we know now.

1866
05:03:04,526 --> 05:03:05,618
Say he didn't.

1867
05:03:05,694 --> 05:03:06,956
Let's just assume
that he's human,

1868
05:03:07,028 --> 05:03:08,188
makes mistakes
just like all of us.

1869
05:03:08,263 --> 05:03:10,026
I need to
get that number.

1870
05:03:10,098 --> 05:03:11,725
I've been waiting
for that number.

1871
05:03:11,800 --> 05:03:13,062
It was a guy.

1872
05:03:13,135 --> 05:03:15,103
He... He sounded like
mid-thirties.

1873
05:03:15,170 --> 05:03:16,330
Mrs. Shepard, you know
it would be safer

1874
05:03:16,404 --> 05:03:18,929
if you got back
in the car, okay?

1875
05:03:19,007 --> 05:03:20,770
Please get back
in the car.

1876
05:03:20,842 --> 05:03:21,900
I want you to divert

1877
05:03:21,977 --> 05:03:23,444
the incoming
E.S.U. Units

1878
05:03:23,512 --> 05:03:24,809
to Broadway and just
hold them there.

1879
05:03:24,880 --> 05:03:26,142
You want me to start
clearing the streets?

1880
05:03:26,214 --> 05:03:27,272
Yeah, that sounds like
a good idea.

1881
05:03:27,349 --> 05:03:28,338
No, no, no.

1882
05:03:28,416 --> 05:03:29,678
I don't want the sniper
to be aware

1883
05:03:29,751 --> 05:03:30,911
of any of our movements.

1884
05:03:30,986 --> 05:03:32,419
He's already
got position on us.

1885
05:03:32,487 --> 05:03:35,217
Let's not let him know
we know too much, okay?

1886
05:03:35,290 --> 05:03:36,222
I got you.

1887
05:03:36,291 --> 05:03:38,020
- Jonah!
- Yeah?

1888
05:03:38,093 --> 05:03:39,651
Don't look up.

1889
05:03:42,531 --> 05:03:44,863
Give me sharpshooters
looking at those windows.

1890
05:03:44,933 --> 05:03:45,900
You got it, Captain.

1891
05:03:45,967 --> 05:03:47,628
I'm gonna buy us
some time here.

1892
05:03:47,702 --> 05:03:49,329
All right.

1893
05:03:55,610 --> 05:03:57,305
Stu, is it okay
if I come out

1894
05:03:57,379 --> 05:03:58,971
and talk to you
for a second?

1895
05:03:59,047 --> 05:04:00,014
I don't know.

1896
05:04:00,081 --> 05:04:01,013
Caller: This guy
is so lonely.

1897
05:04:01,082 --> 05:04:03,209
All he wants to do
is talk.

1898
05:04:03,285 --> 05:04:05,515
You're walking through
a bad dream,

1899
05:04:05,587 --> 05:04:06,849
and you can't wake up.

1900
05:04:06,922 --> 05:04:08,446
Caller: Okay, now he's really
testing my patience.

1901
05:04:08,523 --> 05:04:10,957
You want to wake up,
Stu?

1902
05:04:11,026 --> 05:04:12,823
I want to,
but...

1903
05:04:12,894 --> 05:04:14,452
l... l...
I got issues

1904
05:04:14,529 --> 05:04:16,121
I can't
talk about.

1905
05:04:16,198 --> 05:04:18,189
That your psychiatrist
on the phone, Stu?

1906
05:04:18,266 --> 05:04:21,360
Yeah. I, uh, I'm
paying him overtime.

1907
05:04:21,436 --> 05:04:24,530
That was pretty brave,
what you did.

1908
05:04:25,607 --> 05:04:28,098
Admitting all that stuff
to your wife.

1909
05:04:28,176 --> 05:04:29,404
It was liberating, right?

1910
05:04:29,477 --> 05:04:31,672
Should've been.

1911
05:04:31,746 --> 05:04:33,839
Maybe if I could be
more honest with my wife,

1912
05:04:33,915 --> 05:04:35,849
you know, then...
then I don't know,

1913
05:04:35,917 --> 05:04:37,782
maybe something would've
turned out different.

1914
05:04:37,853 --> 05:04:39,753
Caller: Oh, please.

1915
05:04:39,821 --> 05:04:40,981
Trust is the key.

1916
05:04:41,056 --> 05:04:42,284
You trust me, Stu?

1917
05:04:42,357 --> 05:04:43,881
Caller: Get this man
a seat on <i>Oprah.</i>

1918
05:04:43,959 --> 05:04:46,154
I want to, but
I got, I got...

1919
05:04:46,228 --> 05:04:47,718
issues I can't
talk about.

1920
05:04:47,796 --> 05:04:50,526
Caller: Yes. Lethal issues.
Tell him to stay back.

1921
05:04:50,599 --> 05:04:52,590
Look, don't come
any closer.

1922
05:04:52,667 --> 05:04:53,964
Hey, I don't
want to cause

1923
05:04:54,035 --> 05:04:55,366
or make anything
harder for you.

1924
05:04:55,437 --> 05:04:57,667
Caller: Pam, Ramey, Kelly,
people on the street.

1925
05:04:57,739 --> 05:04:59,263
You've got a lot of lives
in your hands, Stu.

1926
05:04:59,341 --> 05:05:00,467
Look, I already
told you

1927
05:05:00,542 --> 05:05:01,600
this is a private
conversation.

1928
05:05:01,676 --> 05:05:02,700
Now, what the fuck
do you want?

1929
05:05:02,777 --> 05:05:05,268
I want to let you know
that it's safe

1930
05:05:05,347 --> 05:05:06,371
outside the booth.

1931
05:05:06,448 --> 05:05:07,506
Caller: No, it's not.

1932
05:05:07,582 --> 05:05:08,810
Always get out of the
booth. You can't stay...

1933
05:05:08,884 --> 05:05:10,818
I like it
in the fuckin' booth!

1934
05:05:10,886 --> 05:05:12,148
All right?
It's my whole world.

1935
05:05:12,220 --> 05:05:13,312
Now, this is my booth,
and I'm not coming out

1936
05:05:13,388 --> 05:05:14,514
ever, all right? Never!

1937
05:05:14,589 --> 05:05:16,284
We're not gonna try
to force you to come out

1938
05:05:16,358 --> 05:05:19,327
because then there could be
some kind of miscalculation,

1939
05:05:19,394 --> 05:05:22,727
and then I would never
find out why this happened.

1940
05:05:22,797 --> 05:05:24,958
Stu...

1941
05:05:25,033 --> 05:05:26,523
I'm afraid.

1942
05:05:26,601 --> 05:05:29,126
I'm afraid that I'm
gonna be standing by

1943
05:05:29,204 --> 05:05:33,140
and my men are gonna
shoot some guy,

1944
05:05:33,208 --> 05:05:37,042
and when we find out
what he has in his hand

1945
05:05:37,112 --> 05:05:39,512
once we turn over
his dead body

1946
05:05:39,581 --> 05:05:40,707
and we see the thing

1947
05:05:40,782 --> 05:05:42,647
that he was
threatening people with,

1948
05:05:42,717 --> 05:05:46,153
we realize that it was just
a little black bible.

1949
05:05:46,221 --> 05:05:48,416
Or a cell phone.

1950
05:05:48,490 --> 05:05:50,458
Caller: Don't push me, Stu.

1951
05:05:53,528 --> 05:05:55,587
I'm not gonna
let that happen here.

1952
05:05:55,664 --> 05:05:57,564
All I wanted to make
was a phone call.

1953
05:05:57,632 --> 05:05:58,724
One lousy
phone call.

1954
05:05:58,800 --> 05:06:00,631
Caller: That's enough, Stu.

1955
05:06:00,702 --> 05:06:03,569
Ramey: You got some bad news
on that call, right?

1956
05:06:03,638 --> 05:06:05,003
The worst.

1957
05:06:05,073 --> 05:06:07,200
It made you want to
jump off the edge.

1958
05:06:08,510 --> 05:06:09,704
I've been falling
ever since.

1959
05:06:09,778 --> 05:06:11,370
Caller: I'm gonna
push <i>him</i> over the edge.

1960
05:06:11,446 --> 05:06:12,378
Just say the word.

1961
05:06:12,447 --> 05:06:13,379
[Cocks Rifle]

1962
05:06:13,448 --> 05:06:14,472
It's time to land, man.

1963
05:06:14,549 --> 05:06:17,017
When you hit bottom,
you die.

1964
05:06:17,085 --> 05:06:18,518
I'm your safety net.

1965
05:06:18,586 --> 05:06:21,749
Caller: Oh,
please say the word.

1966
05:06:21,823 --> 05:06:24,053
If I tell you what
you want to know,

1967
05:06:24,125 --> 05:06:25,251
you'll die, too.

1968
05:06:25,327 --> 05:06:26,658
Caller: Exactly.

1969
05:06:29,898 --> 05:06:30,990
I'm going.

1970
05:06:31,066 --> 05:06:31,998
Stu: Good.

1971
05:06:33,868 --> 05:06:34,800
Look, Stu.

1972
05:06:34,869 --> 05:06:37,269
Um, we put a call out
to your lawyer.

1973
05:06:37,339 --> 05:06:39,603
Your wife,
she gave us the number.

1974
05:06:39,674 --> 05:06:45,010
And I got my best men
working on

1975
05:06:45,080 --> 05:06:47,844
bringing him down.
Okay?

1976
05:06:47,916 --> 05:06:50,407
Caller: That's it.
The captain gets a bullet.

1977
05:06:50,485 --> 05:06:51,509
Go on, get out of here!

1978
05:06:51,586 --> 05:06:52,848
D-D-Did you hear
what I said, asshole?

1979
05:06:52,921 --> 05:06:54,354
Get out of here!
Go on, now! Go!

1980
05:06:54,422 --> 05:06:55,855
Enough of this sideshow,
Stu.

1981
05:06:55,924 --> 05:06:56,891
No problem.

1982
05:06:56,958 --> 05:06:58,391
Your sins have
finally caught up to you.

1983
05:06:58,460 --> 05:07:00,360
Oh, so this is all some
religious thing, huh?

1984
05:07:00,428 --> 05:07:02,726
Ah, that would explain it.
Bible-crazed killer picks on

1985
05:07:02,797 --> 05:07:04,389
fashion-obsessed P.R. Guy.

1986
05:07:04,466 --> 05:07:05,933
Tell me
what you want, then.

1987
05:07:06,001 --> 05:07:07,366
What everyone wants...

1988
05:07:07,435 --> 05:07:09,699
For the bad guy
to get what he deserves.

1989
05:07:09,771 --> 05:07:11,204
Go for the gun.

1990
05:07:11,272 --> 05:07:13,001
Kill myself?

1991
05:07:13,074 --> 05:07:16,566
Caller: Yes. It would be a rare,
unselfish act.

1992
05:07:16,644 --> 05:07:17,702
Uhh.

1993
05:07:21,082 --> 05:07:22,208
We got hostile action.

1994
05:07:22,283 --> 05:07:23,910
Hey, hey. Nothing is hostile
until I say it is.

1995
05:07:23,985 --> 05:07:25,543
L... I can't find it.

1996
05:07:25,620 --> 05:07:27,212
Caller: Kelly, Pam...
Bam, bam!

1997
05:07:27,288 --> 05:07:29,552
All right, all right. Look.
I found it. I got it.

1998
05:07:29,624 --> 05:07:30,750
Then let's see it.

1999
05:07:30,825 --> 05:07:31,814
Let everyone see it.

2000
05:07:31,893 --> 05:07:32,985
The cops will kill me.

2001
05:07:33,061 --> 05:07:36,258
Yes. You're talking
prime-time material now.

2002
05:07:36,331 --> 05:07:38,322
All this shit just
to watch me die, huh?

2003
05:07:38,400 --> 05:07:40,334
No. To get you to do
what's right.

2004
05:07:40,402 --> 05:07:43,599
If you want
to save yourself, confess.

2005
05:07:43,671 --> 05:07:45,571
I already told Kelly
everything.

2006
05:07:45,640 --> 05:07:46,664
Everything?

2007
05:07:46,741 --> 05:07:49,835
No. No more excuses
and half-truths, Stuart.

2008
05:07:49,911 --> 05:07:53,711
You look out into those cameras
and you bare your soul.

2009
05:07:53,782 --> 05:07:56,580
TV seems to help bring out
the worst in people.

2010
05:07:56,651 --> 05:07:58,516
You should be fine.

2011
05:07:58,586 --> 05:08:00,019
How those techs doing?
We got anything?

2012
05:08:00,088 --> 05:08:02,181
No, not yet.
Not yet.

2013
05:08:02,257 --> 05:08:04,316
We haven't found
your lawyer yet, Stu,

2014
05:08:04,392 --> 05:08:06,053
but we're
getting close. Okay?

2015
05:08:06,127 --> 05:08:07,355
Caller: Stuart,

2016
05:08:07,429 --> 05:08:11,365
I'm offering you a chance
to redeem yourself.

2017
05:08:11,433 --> 05:08:12,457
Come on, Stu.

2018
05:08:12,534 --> 05:08:14,092
Humble yourself
in front of your loved ones

2019
05:08:14,169 --> 05:08:15,761
and millions of strangers

2020
05:08:15,837 --> 05:08:17,065
and me.

2021
05:08:17,138 --> 05:08:18,867
It's do-or-die time.

2022
05:08:18,940 --> 05:08:21,101
What, you couldn't find
anyone worse than me?

2023
05:08:21,176 --> 05:08:22,905
I'm not, not a murderer
or a child molester

2024
05:08:22,977 --> 05:08:25,207
but a publicist
who has fantasies

2025
05:08:25,280 --> 05:08:26,907
about pretty
little actresses,

2026
05:08:26,981 --> 05:08:29,279
who spends all his money
on Italian suits

2027
05:08:29,350 --> 05:08:31,784
and dry-cleaning so people
will think he's important,

2028
05:08:31,853 --> 05:08:33,946
who doesn't waste his time
being nice to people

2029
05:08:34,022 --> 05:08:35,887
who aren't any use to him.
These are my crimes?

2030
05:08:35,957 --> 05:08:39,154
Stuart,
I know your crimes.

2031
05:08:39,227 --> 05:08:40,489
Tell them.

2032
05:09:04,531 --> 05:09:06,795
I've never done
anything for anybody

2033
05:09:06,867 --> 05:09:08,926
who... who couldn't do
something for me!

2034
05:09:09,002 --> 05:09:10,401
I string along an eager kid

2035
05:09:10,470 --> 05:09:12,904
with promises
that I'll pay him money.

2036
05:09:12,973 --> 05:09:16,136
I only keep him around
because he looks up to me.

2037
05:09:16,209 --> 05:09:19,406
Adam, if you're watching,
don't be a publicist.

2038
05:09:19,479 --> 05:09:20,639
You're too good for it.

2039
05:09:20,714 --> 05:09:24,150
I, uh, I lie in person
and on the phone.

2040
05:09:24,217 --> 05:09:25,809
I lie to my friends.

2041
05:09:25,886 --> 05:09:28,650
I lie to newspapers
and magazines

2042
05:09:28,722 --> 05:09:31,418
who, who sell my lies
to more and more people.

2043
05:09:31,491 --> 05:09:34,756
L-l-I'm just a part
of a big cycle of lies.

2044
05:09:34,828 --> 05:09:36,557
I should be
fuckin' president.

2045
05:09:36,630 --> 05:09:38,962
I wear all this Italian shit
because underneath,

2046
05:09:39,032 --> 05:09:41,330
I still feel
like the Bronx.

2047
05:09:41,401 --> 05:09:44,165
I think I need these clothes
and this watch.

2048
05:09:44,237 --> 05:09:48,264
My $2,000 watch is a fake,
and so am I.

2049
05:09:48,341 --> 05:09:52,402
I neglected the things
I should've valued most.

2050
05:09:52,479 --> 05:09:54,447
I valued this shit.

2051
05:09:54,514 --> 05:09:57,847
I take off my wedding ring
to call Pam.

2052
05:09:57,918 --> 05:09:59,977
Kelly, that's Pam.

2053
05:10:03,590 --> 05:10:04,784
Somebody got a 20
on this Pam?

2054
05:10:04,858 --> 05:10:07,122
Don't blame her.
I never told her I was married.

2055
05:10:07,194 --> 05:10:10,163
And if I did, she,
she would've told me to go home.

2056
05:10:11,865 --> 05:10:13,799
Kelly,
looking at you now,

2057
05:10:13,867 --> 05:10:16,267
I'm ashamed of myself.

2058
05:10:16,336 --> 05:10:17,826
All right?

2059
05:10:17,904 --> 05:10:22,136
I mean, l... I work so hard
on this image,

2060
05:10:22,209 --> 05:10:23,642
on Stu Shepard,

2061
05:10:23,710 --> 05:10:26,144
the asshole who refers
to himself in the third person,

2062
05:10:26,213 --> 05:10:29,341
that I only proved
I should be alone.

2063
05:10:29,416 --> 05:10:32,749
I've been dressing up
as something I'm not

2064
05:10:32,819 --> 05:10:34,081
for so long...

2065
05:10:34,154 --> 05:10:37,351
I'm so afraid you won't like
what's underneath.

2066
05:10:37,424 --> 05:10:39,449
But here I am.

2067
05:10:39,526 --> 05:10:41,084
I'm just flesh and blood

2068
05:10:41,161 --> 05:10:42,992
and weakness.

2069
05:10:43,063 --> 05:10:45,122
I, uh...

2070
05:10:45,198 --> 05:10:47,723
I love you
so fucking much.

2071
05:10:47,801 --> 05:10:49,701
[Sobbing]

2072
05:10:49,769 --> 05:10:55,366
I, um,
I take off this ring

2073
05:10:55,442 --> 05:10:58,934
because it only reminds me
of how I failed you.

2074
05:10:59,012 --> 05:11:00,775
And, uh...

2075
05:11:00,847 --> 05:11:02,678
and l... I don't want
to give you up.

2076
05:11:02,749 --> 05:11:04,444
I want to make
things better,

2077
05:11:04,517 --> 05:11:06,610
but it may not be
my choice anymore.

2078
05:11:06,686 --> 05:11:08,779
You... You deserve better.

2079
05:11:24,304 --> 05:11:27,637
You're not gonna
let me go.

2080
05:11:27,707 --> 05:11:28,639
Caller: No.

2081
05:11:28,708 --> 05:11:31,074
You never were.

2082
05:11:31,144 --> 05:11:32,702
I know a thing about lies,

2083
05:11:32,779 --> 05:11:35,577
and I know a thing or two
about liars as well.

2084
05:11:35,649 --> 05:11:37,139
Then why the confession?

2085
05:11:43,623 --> 05:11:45,921
I didn't do it for you.

2086
05:11:50,530 --> 05:11:51,724
Captain, Captain.

2087
05:11:51,798 --> 05:11:54,733
The call to his wife
originated 2:17

2088
05:11:54,801 --> 05:11:57,099
at a hard line from
the old Barkley Hotel.

2089
05:11:57,170 --> 05:11:58,228
You got a room?

2090
05:11:58,305 --> 05:11:59,795
604.

2091
05:11:59,873 --> 05:12:01,101
Second window
from the corner.

2092
05:12:01,174 --> 05:12:02,641
All E.S.U. Units
still holding.

2093
05:12:02,709 --> 05:12:04,939
Bring 'em in from
the 52nd Street side.

2094
05:12:05,011 --> 05:12:06,273
Cover the windows,
the doors,

2095
05:12:06,346 --> 05:12:08,109
the fire escape,
every goddamn point of exit.

2096
05:12:08,181 --> 05:12:09,113
Right.

2097
05:12:09,182 --> 05:12:10,376
Stu!

2098
05:12:10,450 --> 05:12:11,439
Sgt. Cole: 52nd Street side.

2099
05:12:11,518 --> 05:12:14,316
...your lawyer's
coming down now!

2100
05:12:14,387 --> 05:12:15,877
Now.

2101
05:12:15,956 --> 05:12:18,789
Caller: At least you'll die
with a clean conscience.

2102
05:12:18,858 --> 05:12:20,758
No. You're the one
that's gonna fuckin' die.

2103
05:12:20,827 --> 05:12:22,454
Listen. Listen.
You can hear them right now.

2104
05:12:22,529 --> 05:12:24,121
They're coming up the stairs.
They're coming to get you.

2105
05:12:24,197 --> 05:12:25,630
And you know why?
Because I sent them.

2106
05:12:25,699 --> 05:12:26,893
Stuart, you can't
stop lying, can you?

2107
05:12:26,967 --> 05:12:28,127
What, I can't stop lying?

2108
05:12:28,201 --> 05:12:29,463
They're coming up
the fucking stairs.

2109
05:12:29,536 --> 05:12:30,628
They're coming to get you.
Look around you.

2110
05:12:30,704 --> 05:12:31,830
Look around you.

2111
05:12:31,905 --> 05:12:33,236
That room's getting fuckin'
smaller every second,

2112
05:12:33,306 --> 05:12:34,898
isn't it? Inch by inch.
You know what?

2113
05:12:34,975 --> 05:12:36,408
Until it's not gonna be
any bigger

2114
05:12:36,476 --> 05:12:37,738
than this fuckin'
goddamn booth.

2115
05:12:37,811 --> 05:12:39,403
They're in position.
They're in position.

2116
05:12:39,479 --> 05:12:40,468
- Move!
- Move! Move!

2117
05:12:46,987 --> 05:12:48,318
Caller: No, Stuart.
There's nobody out there.

2118
05:12:48,388 --> 05:12:49,582
There's nobody there?
Listen,

2119
05:12:49,656 --> 05:12:50,918
they're coming through
that fuckin' door

2120
05:12:50,991 --> 05:12:52,253
to put you
out of your misery.

2121
05:12:52,325 --> 05:12:53,587
You only got
a couple of seconds left.

2122
05:12:53,660 --> 05:12:54,922
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna run?

2123
05:12:54,995 --> 05:12:56,758
If this is true, Stuart,
then I have to take

2124
05:12:56,830 --> 05:12:58,092
someone with me,
don't I?

2125
05:12:58,164 --> 05:12:59,256
And since Kelly is
the most important thing

2126
05:12:59,332 --> 05:13:01,596
to you in your life,
I'll take her.

2127
05:13:01,668 --> 05:13:03,966
Take me! Take me!
This is about me!

2128
05:13:04,037 --> 05:13:07,768
I'm the fuckin' one
you want. Take me!

2129
05:13:07,841 --> 05:13:10,105
This is about me!
Come on!

2130
05:13:10,176 --> 05:13:12,303
Take me!
It's me you want!

2131
05:13:12,379 --> 05:13:14,677
[Echoing] Me you want!
This is about me!

2132
05:13:14,748 --> 05:13:15,680
I'm the fuckin' one
you want!

2133
05:13:15,749 --> 05:13:18,980
Come on! Take me!

2134
05:13:19,052 --> 05:13:21,577
[Gunshot]

2135
05:13:26,026 --> 05:13:28,688
[Kelly Screaming]

2136
05:13:48,148 --> 05:13:51,049
This is Captain Ramey.
Somebody talk to me.

2137
05:13:51,117 --> 05:13:53,085
We're too late, Captain.
Son of a bitch psycho

2138
05:13:53,153 --> 05:13:54,586
heard us coming
and slashed his throat

2139
05:13:54,654 --> 05:13:55,586
with
a carpenter's knife.

2140
05:13:55,655 --> 05:13:56,587
What's his condition?

2141
05:13:56,656 --> 05:13:58,590
Critical. He's lost
a lot of blood.

2142
05:13:58,658 --> 05:14:00,148
Get him down here now.

2143
05:14:00,226 --> 05:14:02,091
I don't want nobody
dying on me.

2144
05:14:02,162 --> 05:14:03,288
All right.

2145
05:14:03,396 --> 05:14:05,557
Kelly, where's Kelly?

2146
05:14:05,632 --> 05:14:07,429
Sgt. Cole: Your wife's fine,
all right?

2147
05:14:07,500 --> 05:14:08,990
Now try not to sit up.

2148
05:14:10,804 --> 05:14:11,998
What hit me?

2149
05:14:12,072 --> 05:14:13,767
Rubber bullet.
Figured if someone

2150
05:14:13,840 --> 05:14:15,501
was gonna shoot you,
might as well be us.

2151
05:14:15,575 --> 05:14:17,440
Heh heh. Thanks.

2152
05:14:17,510 --> 05:14:19,910
Uhh, did you get him?

2153
05:14:19,979 --> 05:14:21,173
You did.

2154
05:14:21,247 --> 05:14:22,612
I didn't do anything.

2155
05:14:22,682 --> 05:14:24,115
Gotta give yourself
some credit.

2156
05:14:24,184 --> 05:14:26,049
You got yourself
out alive.

2157
05:14:26,119 --> 05:14:27,780
Doesn't always
happen that way.

05:14:30,657 --> 05:14:31,555
- Are you okay?
- It's okay.

2161
05:14:31,624 --> 05:14:32,716
I'm okay.

2162
05:14:32,792 --> 05:14:34,020
Oh, God.

2163
05:14:34,094 --> 05:14:35,220
I was so afraid.

2164
05:14:35,295 --> 05:14:37,729
I thought I wasn't ever
gonna see you again.

2165
05:14:37,797 --> 05:14:38,786
Me, too.

2166
05:14:38,865 --> 05:14:41,425
A lot of things
we got to talk about.

2167
05:14:41,501 --> 05:14:44,095
I only want to talk about
what you want to tell me.

2168
05:14:44,170 --> 05:14:45,899
I want to tell you
everything.

2169
05:14:45,972 --> 05:14:46,904
Everything.

2170
05:14:49,442 --> 05:14:50,739
Get that gurney
over here, please.

2171
05:14:50,810 --> 05:14:51,799
Get over here.

2172
05:14:51,878 --> 05:14:53,038
We lost him.

to stand up.

I got him.

05:14:58,451 --> 05:15:00,248
Yeah, I got
to see him.

2177
05:15:00,320 --> 05:15:01,912
You don't wanna see
this, Mrs. Shepard.

2178
05:15:01,988 --> 05:15:02,920
Yes, I do.

2179
05:15:02,989 --> 05:15:03,921
Okay, take it easy.

Yes, I do.

Allow me.
Allow me.

05:15:05,992 --> 05:15:06,924
Go ahead.

Ramey: You
recognize him?

2184
05:15:14,868 --> 05:15:16,768
Yeah. He... He
was down there

2185
05:15:16,836 --> 05:15:18,497
trying to deliver me
a pizza

2186
05:15:18,571 --> 05:15:21,597
10 minutes before
I got the call.

2187
05:15:21,674 --> 05:15:23,608
I, uh, told him
to fuck off.

2188
05:15:23,676 --> 05:15:25,701
That's enough
these days.

2189
05:15:30,683 --> 05:15:32,878
Just give it
a minute.

I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye.

2197
05:16:29,475 --> 05:16:34,003
I feel bad
about the pizza guy.

2198
05:16:34,080 --> 05:16:37,277
But I couldn't miss seeing
you and Kelly reunited.

2199

You don't have to thank me.

newfound honesty lasts.
