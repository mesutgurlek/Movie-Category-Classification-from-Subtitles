a lot of people in Southie loved Jimmy.

166
00:09:05,096 --> 00:09:07,463
OLSEN: And you'd include
John Connolly in that group?

167
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:09,640
WEEKS: Well, especially John Connolly.

168
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:11,585
I mean, he grew up in the projects

169
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,009
a few doors down from the Bulger brothers.

170
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:15,450
He was tight with Billy,

171
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:17,074
but like every other
kid in the neighborhood,

172
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:19,741
he was in awe of Jimmy.

173
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:21,601
The story goes, when he was growing up,

174
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:24,026
Connolly was taking a
beating from some guys,

175
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:26,755
and Jimmy stepped in and
saved his ass, I guess.

176
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:27,967
MORRIS: We've now come home

177
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:30,012
to focus on this office's top priority,

178
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:32,007
which is really the North
End of the Italian Mafia,

179
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:33,506
led by Gennaro Angiulo.

180
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,502
He's a hell of a cop,
he's a straight shooter,

181
00:09:35,537 --> 00:09:37,840
and, well, we're damn lucky to have him.

182
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:38,969
Welcome, John.

183
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:41,838
[applause]

184
00:09:41,994 --> 00:09:44,698
WEEKS: You know, Southie kids...

185
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,663
we went straight from
playing cops and robbers

186
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:49,801
on the playground to doing
it for real in the streets.

187
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,535
And just like on the playground,

188
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,120
it wasn't always easy to tell who's who.

189
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:56,350
CONNOLLY: There he is.

190
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:58,241
Oh, John!

191
00:09:58,638 --> 00:09:59,670
How are you?

192
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:00,847
Yeah, good.

193
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:02,368
If I'm buying anyone,

194
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,013
- I'm buying Gary Carter.
- Gary Carter.

195
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:06,478
That kid is a star in the making.

196
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:07,755
Which is why it'll never happen.

197
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,947
Not in a million fuckin'
years. You know why?

198
00:10:09,982 --> 00:10:12,558
BOTH: Because it's the Sox.

199

[both chuckle]

200
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:16,158
So, seriously, what do I call you now?

201
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:18,127
I mean, is it Billy?

202
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:20,230
Or I got to call you Senator?

203
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:22,642
Oh, come on. I'm the one drooling here.

204
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,311
Mr. FBI Hero.

205
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,161
[laughs]

206
00:10:25,229 --> 00:10:26,722
How's the wife? How's Marianne?

207
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:28,569
Great. Can't complain.

208
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:32,051
Well, look at you. Look at you.

209
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:35,303
I haven't forgotten where we came from.

210
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:36,910
"Don't you ever do that again.

211
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:38,813
I want to see you throw the first punch,

212
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:40,301
and throw the first two punches."

213

[both chuckle]

214
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:45,305
Oh, man. Yeah, I got to
get down to the Old Harbor.

215
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,743
You ought to, John.

216
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,787
Your ma would love to see you.

217
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:51,238
How's, uh... how's your brother?

218
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:52,369
How is Jimmy?

219
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:53,961
Jimmy's Jimmy.

220
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:55,020
You know?

221
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:55,979
Why do you ask?

222
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:57,241
Well, it's no secret

223
00:10:57,276 --> 00:10:59,910
that Southie's been a war zone lately.

224
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:03,087
What, with 60, 70 slayings?

225
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:05,805
But your brother and his Winter Hill boys,

226
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,996
they're still out there.

227
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:09,979
They must be doing something right. Right?

228
00:11:12,194 --> 00:11:14,561
All right, John. Let's
call this what it is.

229
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:16,201
You're jerking me off under the table

230
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:17,338
- to get to Jimmy.
- I'm not.

231
00:11:17,392 --> 00:11:18,988
Jimmy's business is Jimmy's business.

232
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:21,292
It sure as hell ain't none of mine.

233
00:11:22,012 --> 00:11:25,569
I got an edict to eradicate the Mafia.

234
00:11:25,723 --> 00:11:28,432
And I know that Jimmy and Stephen Flemmi

235
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,431
are musclin' in on their numbers rackets

236
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:32,919
and their vending machines.

237
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:35,908
And I know that this ain't
sitting very well with Angiulo.

238
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:36,737
I don't want to hear this.

239
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:38,841
You need to hear this, Billy.

240
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:41,335
Your brother...

241
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,502
is wading in some very dark waters.

242
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:52,901
You know... we all need friends.

243
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:55,972
Even Jimmy.

244
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:57,731
Even you.

245
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,399
Nobody gets there on their own.

246
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:02,357
Ain't that right, Senator?

247
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:05,280
You know what, John?

248
00:12:05,536 --> 00:12:07,453
It's good to see you doing so well.

249
00:12:07,584 --> 00:12:08,882
Really, it is.

250
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:11,214
Give my regards to the boys at the Plaza.

251
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:13,071
Listen, you don't want to
give that to Jimmy, fine.

252
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:19,796
But just tell him I
said... hello, and I'm back.

253
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:21,292
Oh, if Jimmy wants to get in touch,

254
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:23,835
he'll find you. Trust me.

255
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:26,235
You ought to come over to dinner sometime.

256
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:28,699
Mary and the kids would love to see you.

257
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,551
Robert, how are things?

258
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:32,151
How are you, Senator?

259
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,754
Good to see you.

260
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:45,032
Oh, there she is.

261
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:47,421
Agent Marianne.

262
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,568
Hands where I can see 'em.

263
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:52,933
Looks good. You're making progress.

264
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,962
Well, thank you, Agent Connolly.

265
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:56,287
Did you save Boston yet?

It's early, but I'm working on it.

268
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:02,169
You better work hard, because
Hoover's expecting big things

269
00:13:02,237 --> 00:13:04,339
from his favorite son.

270
00:13:05,446 --> 00:13:06,704
He won't be disappointed.

271
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:07,641
Oh, is that so?

What are you doing? I know what you want.

00:13:26,957 --> 00:13:30,361
- Jimmy? Is that you?
- What you looking for?

277
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:31,966
Good morning, Ma.

278
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:34,457
How was work?

279
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:37,319
It was long. I got to get
some sleep, sweetheart.

280
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,780
How we doin', huh?

281
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:40,880
All right, hey.

282
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,754
You still owe me $56.

283
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,477
What do you say? Hmm?

284
00:13:45,512 --> 00:13:47,322
All right, one hand, huh?

285
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:48,638
- One hand.
- Ah, yeah, yeah.

286
00:13:48,673 --> 00:13:51,567
And $56 is still a lot of money, Jimmy.

287
00:13:51,602 --> 00:13:53,116
Oh, don't I know it.

288
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:55,006
You gonna cheat me again
or you gonna play straight?

289
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:58,335
Ah, look who's talkin'. Cheat.

290
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,555
Ah, Jimmy... get the jacket off.

291
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:02,687
Here we go.

293

Come on! Not again.

294
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:27,053
You're not paying attention.

295
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:29,157
Can't you see I'm after hearts?

296
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:32,135
And you just keep feeding me hearts!

297
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,614
Billy, I'm getting creamed over here.

298
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:34,379
Better you than me, pal.

299
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,356
Did you learn nothing in prison?

300
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:40,067
Oh, all those hours and no
one taught you how to play gin.

301
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,270
Well, they didn't teach me
how to cheat against my mom.

302
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,795
Look, here's my cards. Count 'em out.

303
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,705
Hey, Ma, did you know old Mother
Burke died over on Baker Street?

304
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,647
No one found her for a couple of weeks.

305
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,082
That's right.

306
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:55,117
And when they broke down the door,

307
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:58,310
her cats had devoured the best part of her.

308

I'm out. I got creamed,
I'm going to take a nap.

Thanks for cheating, Ma.

- Yeah?

Yeah, why? What's up?

00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:47,662
I... I have it on very good authority

330
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:52,219
that Gennaro Angiulo is
planning to have you murdered.

331
00:16:52,937 --> 00:16:54,211
Is that so?

332
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:57,538
And how does he plan to achieve that?

333
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,674
That's the kind of
information that my side gets.

334
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,033
And that's the kind of
information that we can provide.

335
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:06,995
John, do you know what I do to rats?

336
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,433
It ain't rattin', Jimmy.

337
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,853
It's an alliance.

338
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,917
An alliance between me and the fuckin' FBI?

339
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:17,056
No, no, between you and me.

340
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:22,181
I can help you, Jimmy, and you can help me.

341
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:25,794
Listen, the whole fucking game has changed.

342
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,316
And I'm not trying to clean up Southie.

343
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:32,003
Fuck that! I fuckin' love this place.

344
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:34,350
I'm interested in the North End

345
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:37,123
and taking down the fuckin' WOPs.

346
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:40,602
I'm interested in the Mafia,
and I bet you are, too.

347
00:17:46,563 --> 00:17:47,934
That's two minutes.

348
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:50,059
Just think about it, will you?

349
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:53,027
[engine turns over]

350
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:30,712
Hi.

351
00:18:33,268 --> 00:18:37,218
Here she is, Miss America.

352
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:42,709
And don't we look beautiful today.

353
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:44,226
[chuckles]

354
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:49,339
Where's my boy, sleeping upstairs?

355
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:49,959
Yeah.

356
00:18:49,994 --> 00:18:51,976
- Should I wake him up?
- No.

357
00:18:52,044 --> 00:18:53,539
- You don't want me to wake him up?
- No!

358
00:18:53,574 --> 00:18:55,205
You sore at me?

359
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,217
Jimmy, don't wake him up.

360
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:58,885
I'll be sore if you wake him up.

361
00:18:58,953 --> 00:19:00,400
I'm gonna go wake him up now.

362
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:02,657
- Don't wake him up.
- Wakin' him up.

363
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:26,563
Hey, buddy. Got a question for you.

364
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:31,796
What are you gonna do
with the rest of that?

365
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:33,229
Not drink it.

366
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:35,958
No, buddy, you got to
drink every drop of that.

367
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:37,510
You know why?

368
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,324
That is pure vitamin C,

369
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:43,016
and it's freshly squeezed by your mommy,

370
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:47,674
which is, obviously, makes it
more special, even magical-like.

371
00:19:47,709 --> 00:19:51,375
It's true. Go on. Put it away.

372
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:54,311
Good boy.

373
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:56,922
So...

374
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:01,618
do you feel like, maybe,
you want to tell me

375
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:03,940
what happened in school yesterday?

376
00:20:11,818 --> 00:20:14,767
Oh, I remember. Something did happen.

377
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,740
Yeah? What happened?

378
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:20,579
Timmy. He's the kid who's
always trying to trip me.

379
00:20:20,672 --> 00:20:22,835
And he stole my coloring
pencils off my desk

380
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,603
when my back was turned.

381
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:26,691
So I punched him in the face.

382
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:27,888
Good boy.

383
00:20:27,923 --> 00:20:29,125
LINDSEY: Jimmy.

384
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,454
Hey.

385
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,152
Let me ask you a question...

386
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:33,912
is that why you think you got in trouble?

387
00:20:33,947 --> 00:20:36,504
'Cause you punched him in the face?

388
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:38,354
All right.

389
00:20:38,396 --> 00:20:40,548
I need you to listen very
carefully to what I'm sayin'

390
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,563
because there are lessons again and again

391
00:20:42,611 --> 00:20:44,724
throughout your whole life.

392
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,561
You got to learn from these things, right?

393
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:49,334
Here's the deal...

394
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:52,136
you did not get in trouble

395
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:54,682
because you punched this
sneaky brat in the face.

396
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:55,981
Not at all.

397
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:57,954
You got in trouble

398
00:20:58,052 --> 00:21:01,200
because you punched this
sneaky little brat in the face

399
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:03,184
in front of other people.

400
00:21:03,219 --> 00:21:04,258
[sighs]

401
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:06,149
Jimmy?

402
00:21:06,488 --> 00:21:08,063
I really don't think that
that's the right thing

403
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,999
to be teaching your kid.

404
00:21:10,155 --> 00:21:15,523
No, that's absolutely what I
should be tellin' him, babe.

405
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:18,554
So, the lesson you got to learn is this...

406
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:20,814
it's not what you do,

407
00:21:20,876 --> 00:21:22,439
it's when and where you do it,

408
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,393
and who you do it to or with.

409
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:28,227
Huh? You follow?

410
00:21:28,281 --> 00:21:30,179
Yes, I follow.

411
00:21:30,276 --> 00:21:32,397
Punch people when no one's looking.

412
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,927
- That's exactly right.
- [chuckles nervously]

413
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:38,653
If nobody sees it,

414
00:21:38,808 --> 00:21:40,577
it didn't happen.

415
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:44,848
[police radio chatter]

416
00:21:44,883 --> 00:21:47,922
[siren wails]

417
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,352
Well, look what crawled out of the gutter.

418
00:22:02,435 --> 00:22:04,747
Good afternoon, Officer Flynn.

419
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:07,636
What happened? I must
have been doing 30 in a 25.

420
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:09,408
Gonna lock me up for life or somethin'?

421
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:10,756
TOMMY: Why don't you do your fucking job

422
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,454
instead of trying to jerk off on
us, you pathetic fuckin' stiff?

423
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:16,285
- All right, Tommy. Tommy!
- I'm doing my fuckin' job.

424
00:22:16,332 --> 00:22:19,395
I'm sure the officer
didn't stop us by accident.

425
00:22:19,482 --> 00:22:21,297
You wouldn't happen to
be carrying a message,

426
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:22,896
now, would you?

427
00:22:22,957 --> 00:22:28,119
In fact, I am. Gerry
Angiulo sends his regards.

428
00:22:28,218 --> 00:22:30,210
Says he doesn't like finding
his boys beat to a pulp

429
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:32,471
and left for dead in empty parking lots.

430
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,253
He also said he's confident

431
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:35,190
you ain't gonna cause him any more troubles

432
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:38,391
'cause if you do, it's only gonna
cause much worse troubles for you.

433
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:39,764
Listen, motherfucker.

434
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,406
You think 'cause you're
wearing a fucking uniform,

435
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:42,262
you can do what you want?

436
00:22:42,323 --> 00:22:44,253
- Go fuck yourself!
- Tommy!

437
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,928
- Fuck you!
- Tommy, close the fucking door.

438
00:22:47,294 --> 00:22:49,603
I got to tell you something, Officer Flynn.

439
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:52,624
It's a sad day when a native son

440
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:54,591
takes up with his oppressor.

441
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,586
There's a word for that
back home, you know.

442
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,444
Penalty's death.

443
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:01,010
You threatenin' me, Bulger?

444
00:23:01,045 --> 00:23:03,702
The last thing I would do
if I was planning to harm you

445
00:23:03,737 --> 00:23:06,249
is to warn you in advance, you dumb fuck.

446
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,887
You better watch yourself, Bulger.

447
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:09,552
You better fuck yourself, Flynn.

448
00:23:09,587 --> 00:23:13,224
Fuck you, you project rat.
And fuck you, you rummy.

449
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:22,610

450
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:28,202
TOMMY: I never trusted
Flynn. He's a fucking prick.

451
00:23:28,348 --> 00:23:29,422
LEONARD: Take it easy, will you?

452
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:31,924
Even as kids, he was a fuckin' prick!

453
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,267
A fuckin' prick.

454
00:23:33,302 --> 00:23:34,773
Please, calm down.

455
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:37,051
Swear to God, I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

456
00:23:37,086 --> 00:23:38,445
I'll fucking kill that Flynn.

457
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,641
Take it easy, will you?

458
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,018
Cock-sucking, turncoat motherfucker.

459
00:23:43,053 --> 00:23:44,178
He's fucking dead!

460
00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:46,111
JIMMY: You're not fuckin'
killing anybody, Tommy,

461
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:48,525
and you ain't killing a cop any time.

462
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,762
You hear me?

463
00:23:53,188 --> 00:23:54,501
Fuck you, Whitey.

464
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:56,723
Oh, Jesus. Tommy...

465
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:59,852
- Go fuck yourself.
- Come on. Enough.

466
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:01,817
Huh?

467
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:02,560
Fuck you.

468
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:04,408
Take it easy. Take it easy, come on.

469
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:06,404
You want to take a shot, Tommy?

470
00:24:06,454 --> 00:24:08,343
- Enough.
- Take your shot.

471
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:09,472
But make it your fucking best,

472
00:24:09,507 --> 00:24:11,095
'cause I get up, I eat you.

473
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:13,022
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Let's go. Come on.

474
00:24:13,057 --> 00:24:14,594
Relax. Jimmy, he's shit-faced.

475
00:24:14,634 --> 00:24:15,995
- I'll deal with him.
- Fuckin' better.

476
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,577
- Don't even worry about it.
- What, you think I look fucking worried?

477
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,333
Sit down. Please, sit down.

478
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:22,939
Jesus Christ, he's fuckin' retarded.

479
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,287
Jack-o! Give me another one, huh?

480
00:24:26,688 --> 00:24:28,046
Hey, Tommy.

481
00:24:28,181 --> 00:24:29,255
Yeah?

482
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:31,340
You watch yourself.

483
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,840
OLSEN: Mr. Martorano,

484
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:38,884
you are one of the most
feared men in Boston

485
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:41,354
and well-known as the chief executioner

486
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:43,034
for the Winter Hill Gang.

487
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:44,613
Is that correct?

488
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:45,834
Yes.

489
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,697
You are also reputed to
have murdered some 20 people.

Would you say that is accurate?

That is accurate, yes.

492
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:58,557
Mr. Martorano, I want you
to be as specific as possible

493
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:01,835
in answering why the
war between the Angiulos

494
00:25:01,982 --> 00:25:04,478
and Winter Hill escalated.

495
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:06,985
Simple. Territory.

496
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,299
Specifically South Boston?

497
00:25:09,412 --> 00:25:11,336
Yes, Southie.

498
00:25:12,361 --> 00:25:14,460
Angiulo wanted to control everything...

machines, all the rackets.

And there were consequences.

501
00:25:20,984 --> 00:25:21,710
Yeah.

502
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,225
There was consequences.

510
00:25:54,499 --> 00:25:56,437

Forget about it, Tommy. You was drunk.

I know I was drunk, but
that ain't an excuse.

you know what I mean?

that Tommy ratted out Mickey to Angiulo.

Either that or Tommy
raising a fist to Jimmy,

which is never a good idea.

549
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:52,764
Where'd they bury him?

550
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:55,353
In Jim's favorite spot.

551
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,326
Right there under the
bridge in Neponset River.

552
00:27:59,742 --> 00:28:01,895
He buried so many bodies in that shithole,

553
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:06,610
it became known as the
Bulger Burial Ground.

I don't know how you fuckers didn't get it.

555
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,697
I really don't. I mean, in the beginning,

556
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:15,213
Jim was a small-town player

557
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:18,040
who really only mattered in Southie.

558
00:28:18,214 --> 00:28:20,456
Don't get me wrong... he
was a tough motherfucker,

559
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,347
but small-time.

560
00:28:23,597 --> 00:28:26,529
And then the next thing you
know, he's a goddamn kingpin.

561
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,464
You know why?

562
00:28:29,257 --> 00:28:31,304
Because the FBI let it happen.

CONNOLLY: This is potentially
the biggest opportunity

00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:50,446
the Bureau will ever have had

569

in the history of the city of Boston,

570
00:28:52,826 --> 00:28:54,331
and you need time to think about it?

Before you go flying any
further off the handle,

572
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,341
it might help to recall that
Whitey Bulger is an ex-convict

573
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:04,650
and that his parole category
is "supervised released status,"

574
00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:07,562
a designation that we would
be required to get withdrawn

575
00:29:07,597 --> 00:29:10,654
or else we would be in
violation of Bureau regulations.

576
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:13,037
So? We withdraw or we violate.

we're clinically insane,

By the way, it's "Jimmy," not "Whitey."

The only thing you're gonna get

581
00:29:22,598 --> 00:29:24,952

to this fucker's whims?

If it brings you Angiulo, yes!

585

And what makes you so sure

586
00:29:33,623 --> 00:29:35,120
that he's gonna be a reliable source?

587
00:29:35,155 --> 00:29:36,505
Because in my experience,

588
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,824
everyone of those Winter Hill pricks

589
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,940

his word, he will keep it.

You name it, and yeah, we was doin' it.

812
00:42:58,134 --> 00:42:59,482
BILLY: The lottery, Jimmy?

813
00:42:59,517 --> 00:43:01,530
- _
- JIMMY: What can I tell you, Billy boy?

814
00:43:01,565 --> 00:43:03,542
I went in on a ticket as a lark,

815
00:43:03,577 --> 00:43:06,533
and I fucking won, fair and square. What?

816
00:43:06,568 --> 00:43:09,210
Would you say Winter Hill was thriving?

817
00:43:09,322 --> 00:43:11,106
We were making a lot of money.

818
00:43:11,169 --> 00:43:13,801
Which meant we had to
pay off a lot of people,

819
00:43:13,903 --> 00:43:16,119
keep things running smooth, you know?

820
00:43:16,154 --> 00:43:19,688
Local street cops, Feds, whatever.

821
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:22,372
We were throwing money around like crazy.

822
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:24,565
And then there was those trips to Miami.

823
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,203
We were getting into the jai alai racket

824
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,532
with John Callahan

825
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:31,737
and an individual named Brian Halloran.

826
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:34,489
Jimmy never really trusted him.

827
00:43:34,524 --> 00:43:37,094
I swear to God, I'll shoot
youse both in the face.

828
00:43:37,503 --> 00:43:38,471
[woman screams]

829
00:43:38,706 --> 00:43:41,027
For obvious reasons.

830
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,152
But he didn't think he could
make the deal without him.

831
00:43:45,258 --> 00:43:46,074
So...

832
00:43:46,118 --> 00:43:47,890
MCGUIRE: Right now,
Connolly, Bulger and his crew

833
00:43:47,944 --> 00:43:49,471
are swanning around Southie

834
00:43:49,506 --> 00:43:51,660
like a bunch of fucking
Vikings, raping and pillaging,

835
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:54,546
and we can't touch them because
they're no longer criminals.

836
00:43:54,613 --> 00:43:57,433
They're professional criminal consultants.

837
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,768
But my question to you is,

838
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,458
have they actually given us
one concrete fucking thing

839
00:44:01,493 --> 00:44:02,315
that we can move on?

840
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,441
Just give me a fucking break!

841
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:05,771
After the desert you been walking through?

842
00:44:05,867 --> 00:44:07,769
This is your ticket to the big time.

843
00:44:07,835 --> 00:44:08,955
And all you can do is fucking bitch.

844
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:11,080
All right, you fucking listen to me, John.

845
00:44:11,157 --> 00:44:13,263
We have given Bulger
miles and miles of leeway,

846
00:44:13,298 --> 00:44:16,421
and so far, he's given us dick in return.

847
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:19,495
I need a wire inside
Angiulo's headquarters.

848
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,972
That fucker's been moving around so much,

849
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:23,254
I need to know specifically
where his fucking headquarters

850
00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:25,039
even are, and the fact that we don't

851
00:44:25,074 --> 00:44:27,660
makes us look like a bunch
of fucking Keystone Cops.

852
00:44:27,715 --> 00:44:29,383
I need evidence that I can present

853
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:30,811
to the federal prosecutor.

854
00:44:30,846 --> 00:44:32,364
And you'll get it.

855
00:44:32,542 --> 00:44:34,393
You got two weeks.

856
00:44:34,594 --> 00:44:36,551
That's fucking it!

857
00:44:37,137 --> 00:44:38,957
Then I pull the plug.

858
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,892
[door slams]

859
00:44:49,444 --> 00:44:51,899
JIMMY: Are you telling me that
your fucking boys at the Bureau

860
00:44:51,934 --> 00:44:53,834
can't find Angiulo's place?

861
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:56,926
For fuck's sake, everyone in
Boston knows where the guy is!

862
00:44:56,961 --> 00:44:59,628
The fucker keeps moving
all over the North End.

863
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:01,410
I need specifics, Jimmy.

864
00:45:01,445 --> 00:45:05,000
Not tomorrow, not next week... now. Today.

865
00:45:05,087 --> 00:45:08,775
I need to get a wire inside
Angiulo's headquarters,

866
00:45:08,836 --> 00:45:11,047
or I can't keep protecting you.

867
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:13,120
It's that simple.

868
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:17,870
All right.

869
00:45:18,185 --> 00:45:21,219
But I need you to do something for me.

870
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:23,645
You want a fucking wiretap or not?

871
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,302
Jesus, Jimmy. Jimmy.

872
00:45:27,741 --> 00:45:28,362
[sighs]

873
00:45:28,397 --> 00:45:30,587
I want all of Angiulo's vending machines

874
00:45:30,642 --> 00:45:31,890
out of the Old Colony.

875
00:45:31,925 --> 00:45:35,116
I don't care how you do
it. I just want 'em gone.

876
00:45:35,209 --> 00:45:37,111
Do you follow?

877
00:45:38,952 --> 00:45:41,114
Do you fucking follow?

878
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,750
All right, then.

879
00:45:48,896 --> 00:45:51,980
When you leave for work tomorrow morning,

880
00:45:52,147 --> 00:45:56,378
after you've gone for your
jog down Silver Street...

881
00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:00,936
after you stopped at McNulty's
for a black coffee and a Danish,

882
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,716
after you read the Sports page,

883
00:46:03,751 --> 00:46:05,996
after you kissed Marianne goodbye,

884
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:09,261
you walk straight out
your door to your car,

885
00:46:09,341 --> 00:46:11,243
which is parked in the same fuckin' spot

886
00:46:11,278 --> 00:46:13,285
it's always parked in...

887
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:17,544
right before you put your
keys into the ignition,

888
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:20,787
maybe have a look in the glove box.

889
00:46:24,203 --> 00:46:26,270
There just might be an
early Christmas present

890
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:28,118
in there for you.

891
00:46:43,851 --> 00:46:44,952
What's this?

892
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:47,360
Gentlemen, this is intel,

893
00:46:47,395 --> 00:46:50,059
from our source in Winter Hill.

894
00:46:52,454 --> 00:46:53,589
FITZPATRICK: Holy shit.

895
00:46:53,624 --> 00:46:55,569
98 Prince Street.

896
00:46:55,707 --> 00:46:58,105
Angiulo Family headquarters.

897
00:46:58,197 --> 00:46:59,054
Fuck me.

898
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:02,243
Yeah, "fuck me" and fuck you is right.

899
00:47:02,516 --> 00:47:06,041
An hour ago, I got a
wet shave in a barbershop

900
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:09,741
right across from 98 Prince
in the heart of the North End,

901
00:47:09,835 --> 00:47:13,662
and within 15 minutes, I saw Mikey Angiulo,

902
00:47:13,726 --> 00:47:17,252
Bobby Carozza, and one
Vincent "The Animal" Ferrara

903
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:19,585
- all go inside.
- Jesus, John.

904
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:23,357
Do you want to talk about
who's a valuable asset, Charles?

905
00:47:23,582 --> 00:47:25,215
In five fucking years of nobodies

906
00:47:25,276 --> 00:47:27,443
with Scotch on their
breath giving us shit...

907
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:29,117
not a goddamn thing.

908
00:47:29,152 --> 00:47:30,659
And giving them 40 bucks
to go around the corner

909
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:32,087
and get drunk and dick us around?

910
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:34,423
Fuck that. This, on the other hand,

911
00:47:34,489 --> 00:47:35,913
is the kind of intel we get

912
00:47:35,948 --> 00:47:39,984
from James "Whitey" Bulger, gentlemen.

913
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:41,937
No one else.

914
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,911
FLEMMI: Jimmy always had a plan.

915
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:08,870
Like him giving up Angiulo's
address at 98 Prince Street.

916
00:48:09,077 --> 00:48:11,372
Now, that was a smart play

917
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:17,603
because it kept Connolly,
you know, off our backs.

918
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,298
We had stuff going on in Florida.

919
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:22,681
Situation down there was changing,

920
00:48:22,756 --> 00:48:24,888
and not for the better.

921
00:48:25,257 --> 00:48:28,093
CHAIRMAN: World Jai Alai would
like to introduce its new owner,

922
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,168
C.E.O. and Chief Operating
Officer Roger Wheeler.

923
00:48:32,222 --> 00:48:34,521
- Roger?
- Thank you, Alan.

924
00:48:34,716 --> 00:48:36,670
It's an exciting time for Jai Alai,

925
00:48:36,735 --> 00:48:38,586
and I'm honored to be part of its growth

926
00:48:38,637 --> 00:48:40,991
and expansion here in South Florida.

927
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:44,819
John Callahan has us
poised for great success.

928
00:48:45,898 --> 00:48:48,353
FLEMMI: I can't believe
people pay to watch this shit.

929
00:48:48,435 --> 00:48:50,360
Well, they fucking love it, Stevie.

930
00:48:50,425 --> 00:48:52,291
They fucking love to bet on it.

931
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:54,315
That's making us very rich.

932
00:48:54,455 --> 00:48:57,016
But who knows for how much
longer with Wheeler moving in?

933
00:48:57,084 --> 00:48:59,734
Guy's a fucking double-barreled prick.

934
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:01,732
But at least we still got this.

935
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:04,021
Oh, no, no, no. You give
that to Kevin, not me.

936
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:05,273
All right.

937
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,078
FLEMMI: So, what's the
problem with this Wheeler guy?

938
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:12,156
What's his deal?

939
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,463
He's got CPAs crawling all up my ass,

940
00:49:15,515 --> 00:49:17,943
all over the books,
checking every fucking thing.

941
00:49:17,978 --> 00:49:21,002
The cash flow, the free meals,
the parking-lot receipts.

942
00:49:21,102 --> 00:49:22,988
Just a matter of time before he finds out

943
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,448
how much cash is missing.

944
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,880
Just make him an offer for the company.

945
00:49:26,915 --> 00:49:29,132
Tried. Won't sell.

946
00:49:29,362 --> 00:49:31,522
Would his widow sell?

947
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:37,650
FLEMMI: Maybe she could be persuaded.

948
00:49:37,685 --> 00:49:41,541
Maybe balloonhead over here...
you could do us a favor.

949
00:49:41,576 --> 00:49:43,642
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

950
00:49:43,802 --> 00:49:44,639
Sure.

951
00:49:44,674 --> 00:49:46,374
Whatever you say, Stevie.

952
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:48,470
But, you know, there
must be some other way.

953
00:49:48,538 --> 00:49:50,113
Yeah, but you don't get rid of him,

954
00:49:50,181 --> 00:49:52,303
how's he supposed to go away?

955
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:54,827
What's the downside of this thing, John?

956
00:49:54,862 --> 00:49:56,643
There is no downside, Stevie.

957
00:49:56,678 --> 00:50:00,076
And the upside is, we get our
cut and keep printing money.

958
00:50:00,213 --> 00:50:01,288
I mean, what's to connect you

959
00:50:01,322 --> 00:50:02,926
to anything that happens to Wheeler?

960
00:50:02,987 --> 00:50:05,728
He lives in Tulsa, for fuck's sake!

961
00:50:06,885 --> 00:50:10,505
Everybody knows we have World Jai Alai.

962
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,121
Who's "everybody"?

963
00:50:12,156 --> 00:50:14,320
We're fucking everybody.

964
00:50:14,787 --> 00:50:16,124
Brian.

965
00:50:17,363 --> 00:50:19,732
Take the bag. I want you to have it.

966
00:50:22,343 --> 00:50:24,763
Yeah. I want you to have it.

967
00:50:25,056 --> 00:50:26,101
No.

968
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:27,460
Lot of money in that bag, Jimmy.

969
00:50:27,521 --> 00:50:30,215
I know exactly how much
money's in that fucking bag.

970
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,487
Brian, take the bag and get out of here.

971
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:36,968
To do the hit on... on Wheeler?

972
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:38,022
No.

973
00:50:38,057 --> 00:50:43,598
That's $20,000 for you
to <i>not</i> do the hit.

974
00:50:44,131 --> 00:50:45,364
[chuckles]

975
00:50:46,759 --> 00:50:48,241
I don't get it.

976
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,238
Take the money, keep
your fucking mouth shut

977
00:50:50,271 --> 00:50:51,713
about what you just heard.

978
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:55,130
It's best you're not involved.
Take the fucking money.

979
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:59,101
Take the fucking money.
Take the fucking money.

980
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:02,158
Okay.

981
00:51:04,183 --> 00:51:05,425
Um...

982
00:51:07,205 --> 00:51:09,430
so I should go now?

983
00:51:09,627 --> 00:51:11,938
Yeah, you should go now.

984
00:51:11,977 --> 00:51:13,846
[laughs]

985
00:51:15,663 --> 00:51:17,227
Thank you.

986
00:51:17,363 --> 00:51:19,366
You're welcome.

987
00:51:25,808 --> 00:51:27,857
Listen, I know you guys have your ways

988
00:51:27,892 --> 00:51:29,722
and everything like that, don't you?

989
00:51:29,757 --> 00:51:33,671
But don't ever hand me a bag
of fucking money in public.

990
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:36,484
I'm sorry, Jimmy. I just, I thought that...

991
00:51:36,556 --> 00:51:38,651
No, I know. I get it. It's all right.

992
00:51:38,686 --> 00:51:40,732
Don't sweat it. But I mean...

993
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:43,820
All right.

994
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:45,226
Never again.

995
00:51:45,295 --> 00:51:48,668
But we're good with Wheeler, right?

996
00:51:48,703 --> 00:51:51,073
[chuckles]

997
00:52:04,563 --> 00:52:05,985
MAN: Afternoon, Mr. Wheeler!

998
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:07,342
Howdy.

999
00:52:31,329 --> 00:52:32,686
Roger Wheeler?

1000
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:35,309
- [gunshot]
- [children screaming]

1001
00:52:41,482 --> 00:52:43,091
GENNARO: <i>What the fuck
is this jai alai thing</i>

1002
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:46,144
<i>that Whitey's got his
fingers into all of a sudden?</i>

1003
00:52:46,179 --> 00:52:47,547
<i>What is this bullshit?</i>

1004
00:52:47,602 --> 00:52:49,305
MAN: <i>That's the word on the street.</i>

1005
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,628
<i>Looks like a stupid
fucking game, you ask me.</i>

1006
00:52:51,663 --> 00:52:53,192
<i>Yeah, well, I'll tell ya.</i>

1007
00:52:53,227 --> 00:52:54,741
<i>I don't picture Bulger
going all the way</i>

1008
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:57,194
<i>out to Tulsa, Oklahoma,
to kill somebody.</i>

1009
00:52:57,254 --> 00:52:59,710
<i>But then again, he's
such a sick little fuck.</i>

1010
00:52:59,745 --> 00:53:02,587
<i>And that stupid half-breed
buddy of his, Flemmi.</i>

1011
00:53:02,635 --> 00:53:04,733
<i>The two of them, they'll
go anywhere, anytime</i>

1012
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:08,137
<i>and whack anybody out if there's
a few bucks in it for them.</i>

1013
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:10,571
MORRIS: I got to shut this
fucking thing down, John.

1014
00:53:10,606 --> 00:53:13,146
Now we got people on tape

1015
00:53:13,194 --> 00:53:16,357
talking about how Whitey
and Flemmi committed murder.

1016
00:53:16,396 --> 00:53:18,887
That is a big fucking problem.

1017
00:53:18,922 --> 00:53:22,445
That tape is just gangsters talking shit

1018
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,908
like little fucking housewives.

1019
00:53:23,943 --> 00:53:26,003
Yeah, maybe. But I got
to tell you something.

1020
00:53:26,038 --> 00:53:28,144
McGuire is gonna start asking questions.

1021
00:53:28,192 --> 00:53:31,024
That is why I'm gonna file it very deep.

1022
00:53:31,059 --> 00:53:33,548
All right? Problem gone.

1023
00:53:33,583 --> 00:53:34,367
Gone.

1024
00:53:34,402 --> 00:53:35,488
That's against protocol.

1025
00:53:35,523 --> 00:53:37,259
Fuck protocol.

1026
00:53:37,575 --> 00:53:38,695
Fuck it.

1027
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:39,623
It's a little lie,

1028
00:53:39,664 --> 00:53:43,878
a little white lie to
protect the bigger truth.

1029
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:46,441
You know what Jimmy has given us.

1030
00:53:46,516 --> 00:53:48,651
A gold mine.

1031
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,153
And do you want to be the
person that jeopardizes that?

1032
00:53:53,315 --> 00:53:57,712
We are bringing down the house, man.

1033
00:53:57,802 --> 00:53:59,948
La Cosa Nostra.

1034
00:54:00,158 --> 00:54:02,427
So just relax.

1035
00:54:03,097 --> 00:54:04,488
Relax.

1036
00:54:05,086 --> 00:54:07,062
I'll handle it. It's on me.

1037
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,995
I got this.

1038
00:54:14,403 --> 00:54:17,716
<i>Authorities in Tulsa, Oklahoma,

This meeting between
Rizzo and Sal Manzinni.

00:55:06,507 --> 00:55:07,970
The walk-in in Interview 3

says Whitey Bulger killed Roger Wheeler.

Gentlemen, this is Brian Halloran.

1055
00:55:17,509 --> 00:55:19,633
You have something you want to tell us?

1056

[door closes]

1057
00:55:21,573 --> 00:55:24,268
There's a lot I can tell
you. I need guarantees first.

1058
00:55:24,303 --> 00:55:26,613
CONNOLLY: Fuck you. You
don't get no guarantees.

1059
00:55:26,646 --> 00:55:28,449
You talk or you walk.

1060
00:55:31,543 --> 00:55:33,157
[sighs]

1061
00:55:33,339 --> 00:55:34,941
Okay.

1062
00:55:35,747 --> 00:55:39,331
Whitey Bulger planned
to murder Roger Wheeler,

1063
00:55:39,396 --> 00:55:40,778
that jai alai dude from Tulsa.

1064
00:55:40,813 --> 00:55:42,256
It's been on the news and everything.

1065
00:55:42,317 --> 00:55:44,143
- Tulsa?
- Mm-hmm.

1066
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:48,918
Oh. So, what does some
random jai alai guy in Tulsa

1067
00:55:48,981 --> 00:55:50,918
have to do with Whitey Bulger?

1068
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,135
Whitey was pulling down
some serious coin in jai alai

1069
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:54,687
until Wheeler bought the fucking thing,

1070
00:55:54,722 --> 00:55:56,858
and he didn't want to
cut Whitey in for a piece.

1071
00:55:56,893 --> 00:55:57,928
So...

1072
00:55:58,114 --> 00:56:00,701
You two know anything about this?

1073
00:56:00,787 --> 00:56:01,781
Psh.

1074
00:56:02,347 --> 00:56:03,718
Go on.

1075
00:56:05,102 --> 00:56:07,764
Bulger paid me 20 grand to
keep quiet about the hit.

1076
00:56:07,837 --> 00:56:09,682
Listen, you got to protect me.

1077
00:56:09,717 --> 00:56:10,905
'Cause if you don't, I'm fuckin' dead!

1078
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,018
What weapon was used on Wheeler?

1079
00:56:13,085 --> 00:56:15,745
How should I know? I didn't do
the hit. Johnny Martorano did.

1080
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,406
How do you know it was Martorano?

1081
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:20,626
Look, I make my living
on the streets, okay?

1082
00:56:20,661 --> 00:56:22,521
All right? I know these things.

1083
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:25,158
Hey, look! Look at me!
You got to protect me.

1084
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:27,605
Well, so far, you haven't given us anything

1085
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,129
to merit protection.

1086
00:56:29,198 --> 00:56:30,640
Are you fuckin' deaf?

1087
00:56:30,675 --> 00:56:32,370
I just gave you two fucking names!

1088
00:56:32,405 --> 00:56:35,664
Where was this so-called
meeting taking place?

1089
00:56:37,336 --> 00:56:38,745
You...

1090
00:56:40,284 --> 00:56:42,462
All right, all right.

1091
00:56:42,635 --> 00:56:44,020
Okay.

1092
00:56:44,284 --> 00:56:46,625
I'm in Miami, I hear Jimmy's in town,

1093
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:48,818
and I tag along to a little spot

1094
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:51,138
with Steve Flemmi, Jimmy,

1095
00:56:51,206 --> 00:56:54,728
and this other guy... guy, Callahan.

1096
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,557
And I'm just minding
my own fucking business,

1097
00:56:56,592 --> 00:56:59,581
and then Callahan says
that he thinks that Wheeler

1098
00:56:59,657 --> 00:57:00,821
is gonna be a problem.

1099
00:57:00,902 --> 00:57:03,525
And then Jimmy says,

1100
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,266
"Do you think his widow would be willing

1101
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:07,362
- to sell the franchise?"
- His widow?

1102
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:09,754
Mm-hmm. We all know
what that means, right?

1103
00:57:09,835 --> 00:57:12,605
And then Flemmi asked me
if I could take care of it.

1104
00:57:13,524 --> 00:57:15,940
Would you take a lie detector?

1105
00:57:16,055 --> 00:57:17,880
Okay.

1106
00:57:17,948 --> 00:57:20,070
- Yeah?
- No.

1107
00:57:20,157 --> 00:57:22,471
'Cause then you might start
asking me other questions.

1108
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:25,126
Right? And next thing I know, boom!

1109
00:57:25,161 --> 00:57:27,702
You got me on like 15 other
things I didn't even do!

1110
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:30,789
"Boom"? What did you not do, Brian?

1111
00:57:30,824 --> 00:57:34,361
Did you not kill your drug
dealers in a Chinese restaurant?

1112
00:57:34,452 --> 00:57:36,203
'Cause that's why you're really here.

1113
00:57:36,238 --> 00:57:37,852
That's all over the fucking street,

1114
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,688
so you thought you'd come in here

1115
00:57:39,769 --> 00:57:42,145
and try and cop some
immunity before the fact.

1116
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:43,601
That's what's really going on, isn't it,

1117
00:57:43,636 --> 00:57:45,521
you coke-snorting piece of shit?

1118
00:57:45,602 --> 00:57:47,239
FITZPATRICK: Connolly?

1119
00:57:50,148 --> 00:57:52,952
I'm a fuckin' dead man!

1120
00:58:01,336 --> 00:58:02,543
What do you think?

1121
00:58:02,578 --> 00:58:07,436
I don't believe a fucking
word that guy says.

1122
00:58:08,042 --> 00:58:10,095
I say we cut him loose.

1123
00:58:10,174 --> 00:58:12,206
He's a drug addict.

1124
00:58:12,793 --> 00:58:14,103
Morris?

1125
00:58:16,886 --> 00:58:18,058
Yeah.

1126
00:58:18,217 --> 00:58:22,255
He won't take a polygraph? Cut him loose.

1127
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:27,662
Yeah.

OLSEN: Just for the record,

1293
01:07:08,806 --> 01:07:11,708
you killed John Callahan
that night in Miami...

1294
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:15,770
shot him in the head and stuffed
him in the trunk of his own car.

Yes.

1296

Was John Connolly aware of that fact?

1297

Yes, he was.

1298
01:07:22,915 --> 01:07:24,461

Those lapels, that tapering.

1303

I see you got a nice,
new gold watch there, too.

What are you getting at, Marianne?

Nothing. Not anything.

Ah, here we go.

1317

Ever since you locked arms
with that guy, you've changed.

I can see it like the nose on my face.

He's bad news, John.

He's not bad news.

He is an informant.

You know this. I told you this.

I've known him since forever.

How was he good to you, John?

Did he take you
trick-or-treating?

[whispering] Fuck.

Like it or not, Marianne,
you married a street kid.

1335
01:08:58,290 --> 01:08:59,473
And the streets taught me

1336
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:02,660
that you give and you get
loyalty from your friends.

1337

01:22:01,471 --> 01:22:04,475
Well... Yeah.

1606
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:09,272
And Morris...

1607
01:22:10,321 --> 01:22:13,658
you and I got to have
a little sit-down here.

1608
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:20,807
What the fuck did you
marinate this steak in?

1609
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:22,468
Because it's out of this world.

1610
01:22:22,503 --> 01:22:24,004
You're killing me with it.

1611
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:26,075
Now, now, now.

1612
01:22:26,421 --> 01:22:28,941
It's a family secret. Hmm?

1613
01:22:29,239 --> 01:22:31,700
- Come on.
- [laughs]

1614
01:22:31,801 --> 01:22:33,105
Aw.

1615
01:22:33,236 --> 01:22:35,227
That is one of the best goddamn steaks

1616
01:22:35,262 --> 01:22:37,365
- I ever had in my life.
- Mm-hmm.

1617
01:22:37,442 --> 01:22:38,677
Ever.

1618
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:45,050
- I got a knife over here.
- [laughs]

1619
01:22:45,134 --> 01:22:46,872
Oh, come on. Come on.

1620
01:22:46,935 --> 01:22:48,590
What's... what's the...
what's the family...

1621
01:22:48,650 --> 01:22:50,411
what's the family's secret recipe?

1622
01:22:50,446 --> 01:22:52,721
It's g... it's ground garlic

1623
01:22:52,773 --> 01:22:55,297
and a little bit of soy.

1624
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:58,316
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it. That's it.

1625
01:23:06,016 --> 01:23:08,820
I thought it was a family secret.

1626
01:23:11,751 --> 01:23:14,094
[chuckles] It's a recipe.

1627
01:23:14,148 --> 01:23:15,699
No.

1628
01:23:16,854 --> 01:23:18,302
No.

1629
01:23:19,157 --> 01:23:21,912
You said to me this is a family secret,

1630
01:23:21,947 --> 01:23:24,918
and you gave it up to me, boom.

1631
01:23:25,022 --> 01:23:28,459
Just fucking like that.

1632
01:23:29,073 --> 01:23:30,040
Don't look to John

1633
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:32,472
'cause he's not gonna fucking help you.

1634
01:23:37,736 --> 01:23:41,240
You spill the secret family recipe today,

1635
01:23:41,275 --> 01:23:43,750
maybe you fucking spill about me tomorrow.

1636
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:46,609
Is that something, maybe,
that's a possibility?

1637
01:23:46,644 --> 01:23:47,618
I was just saying...

1638
01:23:47,653 --> 01:23:49,489
You were "just saying"?

1639
01:23:49,615 --> 01:23:53,452
"Just saying" gets
people sent to Allenwood.

1640
01:23:53,518 --> 01:23:57,024
"Just saying" got me a nine-year stretch

1641
01:23:57,059 --> 01:23:59,012
in Leavenworth and Alcatraz.

1642
01:23:59,047 --> 01:24:00,524
You understand?

1643
01:24:00,559 --> 01:24:04,279
So, "just saying"...

1644
01:24:05,463 --> 01:24:09,301
could get you buried real fucking quick.

1645
01:24:18,143 --> 01:24:20,580
[laughing]

1646
01:24:27,164 --> 01:24:29,353
Look at his fucking face!

1647
01:24:29,388 --> 01:24:32,158
Hey! I'm fucking with you.

1648
01:24:32,191 --> 01:24:33,523
Hey, I'm fucking with you.

1649
01:24:33,558 --> 01:24:35,759
It's a recipe. Couldn't give a shit.

1650
01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:38,698
Tastes great. I'm fucking with you.

1651
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:39,404
[laughs]

1652
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:40,952
- [laughs]
- All right.

1653
01:24:40,987 --> 01:24:43,956
You got... well, you... you got me, too.

1654
01:24:44,129 --> 01:24:44,836
[chuckles]

1655
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:47,537
Listen, I... I want to...
I want to make a toast.

1656
01:24:48,887 --> 01:24:50,556
To success.

1657
01:24:52,035 --> 01:24:54,271
Just getting started.

1658
01:25:01,264 --> 01:25:04,630
Mm. Where's the wife?

1659
01:25:04,864 --> 01:25:06,618
She's, uh... she's resting.

1660
01:25:06,653 --> 01:25:08,989
She's... she's a little under the weather.

1661
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,523
Didn't... didn't I just see her?

1662
01:25:13,754 --> 01:25:15,000
Yeah, she was helping.

1663
01:25:15,065 --> 01:25:18,552
She, uh... well, sh... sh...
she's not feeling very good.

1664
01:25:18,706 --> 01:25:19,993
Oh, gee.

1665
01:25:20,067 --> 01:25:21,426
Like a...

1666
01:25:21,553 --> 01:25:23,804
You know what? I'll go have a look at her.

1667
01:25:23,911 --> 01:25:25,119
Jimmy. Jimmy.

1668
01:25:25,154 --> 01:25:26,637
She's sick. She's fi... she's fi...

1669
01:25:26,672 --> 01:25:28,237
listen... fine.

1670
01:25:40,316 --> 01:25:42,252
[doorknob rattles]

1671

[knock on door]

1672
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:50,011
Oh.

1673
01:25:50,046 --> 01:25:52,450
Hi. I thought you were John.

1674
01:25:53,112 --> 01:25:55,579
No, it ain't John.

1675
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:58,789
Come on. Come down and join us.

1676
01:25:58,835 --> 01:26:01,281
No, I'm not feeling
well. Thank you, though.

1677
01:26:02,016 --> 01:26:03,551
Marianne, you know what you're doing?

1678
01:26:03,586 --> 01:26:06,286
You're embarrassing your
husband in front of his friends,

1679
01:26:06,334 --> 01:26:07,670
that's what you're doing.

1680
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:10,421
And you know that's what you're doing.

1681
01:26:10,885 --> 01:26:14,037
I don't know what John told
you, but I'm feeling ill.

1682
01:26:15,857 --> 01:26:17,396
That's all.

1683
01:26:17,563 --> 01:26:19,523
Please, no offense.

1684
01:26:22,298 --> 01:26:24,743
Well, let's see what you got.

1685
01:26:25,195 --> 01:26:27,021
Um...

1686
01:26:28,295 --> 01:26:29,972
yeah.

1687
01:26:32,876 --> 01:26:34,905
Well...

1688
01:26:35,664 --> 01:26:38,395
you don't feel warm.

1689
01:26:40,096 --> 01:26:42,162
Got any chills?

1690
01:26:43,086 --> 01:26:44,634
'Cause normally, you get the chills

1691
01:26:44,669 --> 01:26:47,267
before the flu comes on, you know?

1692
01:26:50,988 --> 01:26:53,091
Any soreness there?

1693
01:26:55,265 --> 01:26:59,195
What are you feeling
there? You feel something?

1694
01:27:01,018 --> 01:27:04,747
'Cause I don't feel any
swollen glands there.

1695
01:27:06,397 --> 01:27:12,592
But, you know, me, I
had to learn the hard way

1696
01:27:13,618 --> 01:27:16,547
not to take chances
with this kind of thing.

1697
01:27:16,608 --> 01:27:18,877
You know what I'm saying?

1698
01:27:20,563 --> 01:27:22,609
Poor little thing.

1699
01:27:23,688 --> 01:27:25,697
You get some rest.

1700
01:27:25,857 --> 01:27:28,182
Wouldn't want nothing to happen to you.

1701
01:27:38,269 --> 01:27:40,704
John's a lucky man.

1702
01:27:45,328 --> 01:27:48,547
[breathing shakily]

1703
01:28:12,414 --> 01:28:13,695
Jimmy?

1704
01:28:15,142 --> 01:28:17,436
I'll get it there safe and sound.

1705
01:28:17,783 --> 01:28:19,614
You can sleep on it.

1706
01:28:19,724 --> 01:28:21,684
I know you will, McIntyre.

1707
01:28:21,756 --> 01:28:23,688
Have safe travels, huh?

1708
01:28:24,244 --> 01:28:25,953
All right.

1709
01:28:25,988 --> 01:28:26,663
Stevie.

1710
01:28:26,698 --> 01:28:28,655
Take care of it, John.

1711
01:28:29,201 --> 01:28:31,085
Weeksy, give me a call.

1712
01:28:31,205 --> 01:28:33,523
Thanks for everything,
Jimmy. We won't forget it.

1713
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:35,036
For me, it's an honor.

1714
01:28:35,124 --> 01:28:36,725
The honor's ours.

1715
01:28:37,035 --> 01:28:38,473
Thanks, pal.

1716
01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:48,780
[siren wails in distance]

_

1718
01:28:55,181 --> 01:28:57,089
CONNOLLY: Hope I'm not interrupting.

1719
01:28:57,121 --> 01:28:58,975
Special Agent John Connolly.

1720
01:28:59,010 --> 01:29:00,643
I know who you are. I've
heard a lot about you.

1721
01:29:00,678 --> 01:29:02,699
Oh, good things, I hope.

1722
01:29:02,794 --> 01:29:05,332
Listen, little welcome
wagon present for you.

1723
01:29:05,426 --> 01:29:07,362
- Big game.
- I'm good.

1724
01:29:07,397 --> 01:29:09,735
Are you sure about that?
Clemens is on the mound tonight.

1725
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:11,315
I'm sure about that.

1726
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:12,853
All right.

1727
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:14,534
Work, work, work.

1728
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:16,551
Well, listen, after... after you finish,

1729
01:29:16,586 --> 01:29:18,573
come down to
The Bell-In-Hand.

1730
01:29:18,643 --> 01:29:20,507
I would like to buy you a pint,

1731
01:29:20,542 --> 01:29:23,049
and you can meet some of the other agents.

1732
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,914
Do you have a case for me, Agent Connolly?

1733
01:29:27,949 --> 01:29:30,688
No, I just came to i... introduce myself.

1734
01:29:30,723 --> 01:29:33,169
You know, couple of local
boys moving up the ranks.

1735
01:29:33,224 --> 01:29:36,302
Maybe we can help each other along. Yeah.

1736
01:29:36,364 --> 01:29:39,326
Bring me cases, that's all the help I need.

1737
01:29:40,097 --> 01:29:41,478
All right.

1738
01:29:43,126 --> 01:29:45,978
All right, well, [chuckles]
I'll leave you to it, then.

1739
01:29:46,115 --> 01:29:47,544
Hey, you know, since you're here.

1740
01:29:47,579 --> 01:29:48,851
Yeah?

1741
01:29:49,266 --> 01:29:51,318
How come no one has nailed Whitey Bulger?

1742
01:29:51,353 --> 01:29:53,282
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1743
01:29:53,317 --> 01:29:55,700
That won't work. I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

1744
01:29:55,735 --> 01:29:57,916
- Excuse me?
- Now, what's Bulger done?

1745
01:29:57,985 --> 01:30:02,898
He's a smalltime hood, but he...
he... he's an invaluable asset.

1746
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:05,495
What's he done?

1747
01:30:05,563 --> 01:30:07,837
Everything, evidently.

1748
01:30:07,872 --> 01:30:10,885
Drugs, extortion, murder.

1749
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:11,743
I'd heard rumors,

1750
01:30:11,798 --> 01:30:14,071
but these other informant
reports make it clear.

1751
01:30:14,106 --> 01:30:14,892
And he... here's the thing...

1752
01:30:14,927 --> 01:30:17,890
every time we start a
formal investigation, poof!

1753
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:20,245
Goes away. He slips free.

1754
01:30:20,505 --> 01:30:22,546
How do you account for that?

1755
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:23,962
I don't know.

1756
01:30:24,597 --> 01:30:27,262
Luck of the Irish? [chuckles]

1757
01:30:27,382 --> 01:30:29,257
"Luck of the Irish"? That's
what you're going with?

1758
01:30:29,292 --> 01:30:31,361
Well, it's...

1759
01:30:33,002 --> 01:30:35,424
...it's slandering lies

1760
01:30:35,459 --> 01:30:37,862
from his brother Billy's
political opponents.

1761
01:30:37,897 --> 01:30:39,908
These fucking assholes from Cambridge,

1762
01:30:39,943 --> 01:30:41,786
they will do anything to bring Billy down

1763
01:30:41,821 --> 01:30:43,423
because they can't stand

1764
01:30:43,458 --> 01:30:45,891
power in the hands of a Mick from Southie.

1765
01:30:45,926 --> 01:30:46,949
You don't think Billy's protecting

1766
01:30:46,984 --> 01:30:48,403
his older brother, just maybe?

1767
01:30:48,438 --> 01:30:50,080
No! No way.

1768
01:30:50,163 --> 01:30:51,670
Really?

1769
01:30:52,001 --> 01:30:52,801
Well, it seems to me

1770
01:30:52,836 --> 01:30:54,349
you'd have to believe
in fucking leprechauns

1771
01:30:54,417 --> 01:30:57,495
to think we have the
biggest crime lord in Boston

1772
01:30:57,641 --> 01:31:00,078
and be brothers with the
most powerful politician

1773
01:31:00,113 --> 01:31:03,779
in the state and them <i>not</i>
be helping each other out.

1774
01:31:03,814 --> 01:31:06,922
I grew up with Billy, Southie.

1775
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,961
So, I know him, I know that <i>he</i> knows

1776
01:31:09,996 --> 01:31:10,916
that it would be crazy

1777
01:31:10,951 --> 01:31:13,787
for him to get mixed up in
anything that Jimmy does.

1778
01:31:13,864 --> 01:31:16,815
It's, you know... too brazen.

1779
01:31:16,928 --> 01:31:18,697
I'll ask you again...

1780
01:31:18,737 --> 01:31:21,499
how come no one has done Whitey Bulger?

1781
01:31:21,595 --> 01:31:24,268
He seems to be involved
in every crime in the city

1782
01:31:24,303 --> 01:31:26,443
and yet the Bureau keeps saying he's clean.

1783
01:31:26,491 --> 01:31:28,824
It's only when <i>another</i>
agency has an informant

01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:31,677
that I hear <i>maybe</i>
Whitey isn't so squeaky clean.

♪♪

1786
01:31:33,911 --> 01:31:35,286
Well, I hear that he's very careful,

1787
01:31:35,321 --> 01:31:39,325
he doesn't use phones...
that kind of stuff, and, uh...

1788
01:31:39,804 --> 01:31:42,880
Who did you say these
other informants were?

1789
01:31:43,296 --> 01:31:44,928
I didn't.

1790

Listen, from what I hear,

1791
01:31:49,694 --> 01:31:51,578
his criminal days are all but over.

1792
01:31:51,613 --> 01:31:53,989
His... his partner and
him, they gone legit...

Christ, Connolly, you fucking with me?!

1794
01:31:56,199 --> 01:31:58,232
Is Whitey never using phones and careful,

1795
01:31:58,267 --> 01:32:00,046
or is Whitey retired?!

1796
01:32:00,093 --> 01:32:01,461
I don't...

1797
01:32:02,546 --> 01:32:04,644
I mean, I just... I'm not in my office...

1798
01:32:04,679 --> 01:32:05,948
these are things that I hear,

1799
01:32:05,983 --> 01:32:07,420
I don't know if all of them are true.

1800
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:09,962
Do your job and find out!

1801

I am. I am. I... I wa...

1802
01:32:16,603 --> 01:32:20,113
You know that I wouldn't come
here if it wasn't serious,

1803
01:32:20,264 --> 01:32:21,712
if there was anywhere else I could turn,

1804
01:32:21,747 --> 01:32:23,717
and I know that the last thing you need

1805
01:32:23,752 --> 01:32:26,916
is to have Jimmy's business
crossing paths with yours.

1806
01:32:26,951 --> 01:32:28,879
Well, your grasp of the
situation is so keen,

1807
01:32:28,914 --> 01:32:30,580
it makes me wonder what you're doing here.

1808
01:32:30,615 --> 01:32:35,229
This new guy, Wyshak, has
a serious hard-on for Jimmy.

1809
01:32:35,264 --> 01:32:37,076
And that can't be good for any of us.

1810
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:38,543
And you're telling me this why?

1811
01:32:38,609 --> 01:32:40,664
Maybe you can influence him.

1812
01:32:40,699 --> 01:32:41,867
Just make him listen to reason!

1813
01:32:41,902 --> 01:32:43,688
I'm not kissing your ass, Billy,

1814
01:32:43,729 --> 01:32:46,201
but you are the most
powerful man in the city.

1815
01:32:46,236 --> 01:32:47,973
Not that I would, but Wyshak's federal,

1816
01:32:48,021 --> 01:32:49,621
and I'm state, and you know that.

1817
01:32:49,656 --> 01:32:54,126
But where we come from, I know and you know

1818
01:32:54,161 --> 01:32:57,759
that what is written on a piece of paper

1819
01:32:57,891 --> 01:33:03,974
is less important than
blood and honor and loyalty.

1820
01:33:07,676 --> 01:33:10,032
I'm not asking you to help me.

1821

I'm asking you to help your brother.

1822

That's the same thing now, isn't it?

1824

questions about you, too.

Oh.

1826
01:33:48,126 --> 01:33:51,284
John, you know I have the
utmost respect for you.

1827
01:33:51,319 --> 01:33:55,283
Really, I do, which is why I
can tell you with all my heart

1828
01:33:55,454 --> 01:33:57,533
that if you ever come into my office again

1829

with a fucked-up idea like that

1830

you'll rue the day you ever
thought of joining the FBI.

FITZPATRICK: This report has information

1833
01:34:20,714 --> 01:34:24,826
attributed to our prized
informant Whitey Bulger.

1834
01:34:27,968 --> 01:34:30,253
And this is the same piece of information

1835
01:34:30,288 --> 01:34:32,424
from one of our other informants

1836
01:34:32,516 --> 01:34:34,118

This is information credited to

1839

our supposedly prized
informant James "Whitey" Bulger.

1843

In fact, if you take a
look at Bulger's pile,

1844
01:34:57,597 --> 01:34:59,206
you'll find the same situation played out

1845
01:34:59,267 --> 01:35:01,224
time and again from other sources.

1846
01:35:01,299 --> 01:35:07,815
In fact, you'll find very little
from Bulger that means shit.

No, and neither did I,

01:38:47,628 --> 01:38:49,591
We are fucked, John.

1921
01:38:49,649 --> 01:38:51,619
- We are fucked.
- Listen to me.

1922
01:38:51,686 --> 01:38:53,652
The Bureau wants results.

1923
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:55,053
We gave them results.

1924
01:38:55,088 --> 01:38:58,071
We drove a stake through
the black heart of the Mafia.

1925
01:38:58,106 --> 01:39:00,745
Everything else is gonna be a sideshow.

1926
01:39:00,799 --> 01:39:01,990
Now we're stuck with Whitey,

1927
01:39:02,025 --> 01:39:04,606
and without the Italians,
nobody can rein him in,

1928
01:39:04,641 --> 01:39:06,444
and we can't even pull on his chain

1929
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:08,081
because we're in too deep!

1930
01:39:08,165 --> 01:39:09,532
And he knows it!

1931
01:39:09,567 --> 01:39:12,685
You understand what I'm
saying about a vise?!

1932
01:39:17,548 --> 01:39:19,776
I thought I was doing good.

1933
01:39:20,457 --> 01:39:22,477
I actually thought I
could make a difference.

1934
01:39:22,512 --> 01:39:23,776
We made a difference.

1935
01:39:23,811 --> 01:39:25,873
We put the Mafia out of business.

1936
01:39:25,965 --> 01:39:29,054
If that ain't good, I don't know what is.

1937
01:39:29,770 --> 01:39:30,807
Yeah.

1938
01:39:32,737 --> 01:39:34,667
And you know what we're doing now, John?

1939
01:39:34,805 --> 01:39:37,142
Digging our own fucking graves.

1940
01:39:47,938 --> 01:39:50,440
[keys jingling]

1941
01:39:54,652 --> 01:39:56,648
[lock rattling]

1942
01:39:56,806 --> 01:39:58,542
[sighs]

1943
01:40:00,216 --> 01:40:01,891
God damn it.

1944
01:40:08,266 --> 01:40:10,053
Marianne!

1945
01:40:12,947 --> 01:40:16,160
Marianne, don't do this!

1946
01:40:19,095 --> 01:40:22,384
Marianne, are you fucking kidding me?!

1947
01:40:32,788 --> 01:40:34,278
WYSHAK: This informant
has been a minor player

1948
01:40:34,313 --> 01:40:37,409
in the Boston crime syndicate
since he was a teenager.

1949
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:39,401
- So you checked his house?
- Yes.

1950
01:40:39,449 --> 01:40:41,051
- And work?
- Mm-hmm.

1951
01:40:41,125 --> 01:40:43,050
And he's never missed an
informant meeting before?

1952
01:40:43,117 --> 01:40:44,928
None I'm aware of. Yeah?

1953
01:40:44,963 --> 01:40:46,186
MAN: No, nothing.

1954
01:40:46,221 --> 01:40:47,411
[knock on door]

1955
01:40:47,468 --> 01:40:49,366
- You want to see me?
- WYSHAK: Yeah, I want to see you!

1956
01:40:49,447 --> 01:40:50,602
McIntyre has vanished

1957
01:40:50,648 --> 01:40:52,498
off the face of the fucking Earth.

1958
01:40:52,549 --> 01:40:53,682
Which seems to be a common phenomenon

1959
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:55,452
for any informant that
says something incriminating

1960
01:40:55,487 --> 01:40:57,124
against Whitey Bulger.

1961
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:01,746
You got nothing to say, Connolly?

1962
01:41:02,143 --> 01:41:03,713
You see these gentlemen here?

1963
01:41:03,997 --> 01:41:05,986
They're gonna help me get this cocksucker.

1964
01:41:06,061 --> 01:41:09,157
If we have to arrest every
lowlife in Boston to do that,

1965
01:41:09,192 --> 01:41:11,093
we'll arrest them... every loan shark,

1966
01:41:11,128 --> 01:41:13,039
every bookie, every drug dealer.

1967
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:15,746
One of those guys is gonna
make a case against him.

1968
01:41:16,746 --> 01:41:19,041
JIMMY: Of all fucking people...

1969
01:41:20,025 --> 01:41:21,197
[chuckles]

1970
01:41:21,472 --> 01:41:22,771
...you.

1971
01:41:32,289 --> 01:41:33,716
MCINTYRE: [voice
breaking] I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1972
01:41:33,751 --> 01:41:36,972
You've always been fucking
weak, John, since we was kids.

1973
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:38,291
- [whimpering]
- What'd you tell them?

1974
01:41:38,326 --> 01:41:42,260
[crying] I don't want to
fucking die. Oh, God, Jimmy!

1975
01:41:42,351 --> 01:41:45,125
I need to know exactly
who you fucking talked to,

1976
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:47,463
and exactly what you said.

1977
01:41:47,558 --> 01:41:50,728
A D.E.A. agent by the name of Brown.

1978
01:41:50,763 --> 01:41:52,124
I told him everything...

1979
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:55,185
the I.R.A., Cahill, the whole bit!

1980
01:41:55,284 --> 01:41:58,899
I know I shouldn't have,
Jimmy, but I had no choice!

1981
01:42:01,744 --> 01:42:03,442
Fuck you.

1982
01:42:04,435 --> 01:42:06,713
You always have a choice.

1983
01:42:06,844 --> 01:42:09,509
You just happened to make
the wrong fucking one.

1984
01:42:09,538 --> 01:42:11,950
[breathing shakily]

1985
01:42:12,734 --> 01:42:14,369
Look at me.

1986
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:19,080
I said fucking look at me.

1987
01:42:20,517 --> 01:42:22,721
I known you a long time.

1988
01:42:23,667 --> 01:42:26,670
And for you to fuck me like this...

1989
01:42:29,044 --> 01:42:31,280
...fucking hurts.

1990
01:42:34,452 --> 01:42:37,942
So I'm gonna fucking bury you right here

1991
01:42:37,982 --> 01:42:40,544
where all the other weak
people have been buried.

1992
01:42:40,579 --> 01:42:41,870
Jimmy, I'm sorry!

1993
01:42:41,905 --> 01:42:44,439
But you'll be dead before
Stevie pulls your teeth,

1994
01:42:44,494 --> 01:42:46,377
which is more than you fucking deserve,

1995
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:47,798
- I'll tell you that.
- Jimmy, I'm sorry! Jimmy, I'm sorry!

1996
01:42:47,833 --> 01:42:50,069
Jimmy, I'm sorry! Oh, God, Jimmy, I'm...

1997
01:42:51,185 --> 01:42:52,921
[gurgling]

1998
01:42:59,809 --> 01:43:02,246
[grunting]

1999
01:43:12,469 --> 01:43:16,116
[panting slightly]

2000
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:17,481
Take out his fucking teeth.

2001
01:43:17,542 --> 01:43:19,934
Bury him next to the whore.

2002
01:43:45,688 --> 01:43:48,012
Special Agent John Morris, FBI.

2003
01:43:48,217 --> 01:43:50,572
Gerard O'Neill, <i>Boston Globe.</i>

2004
01:43:50,647 --> 01:43:52,451
Dick Lehr, same.

2005
01:43:52,486 --> 01:43:54,945
Thank you for meeting with us.

2006
01:43:55,618 --> 01:43:57,690
I feel like, uh...

2007
01:43:58,861 --> 01:44:00,517
[chuckles softly]

2008
01:44:00,759 --> 01:44:02,866
Like I should be in a confessional.

2009
01:44:03,353 --> 01:44:06,271
It's the right thing to do, John.

2010
01:44:09,016 --> 01:44:11,546
Anything I tell you has
to be off the record.

2011
01:44:11,581 --> 01:44:13,402
- You understand?
- Of course.

2012
01:44:13,437 --> 01:44:17,289
We'll develop our own sources,
corroborate everything.

2013
01:44:18,504 --> 01:44:20,505
[sighs softly]

2014
01:44:20,977 --> 01:44:22,670
Where do I start?

2015
01:44:28,671 --> 01:44:30,428
- What do you know?
- All of it.

2016
01:44:30,463 --> 01:44:31,723
LEHR: We know.

2017
01:44:31,755 --> 01:44:32,930
And you're running it?

2018
01:44:32,965 --> 01:44:34,835
We wouldn't be here if we weren't.

2019
01:44:57,101 --> 01:45:00,230
_

2020
01:45:17,421 --> 01:45:18,712
[sighs]

2021
01:45:20,711 --> 01:45:21,779
What?

2022
01:45:24,654 --> 01:45:26,132
What is it, Jim?

2023
01:45:41,975 --> 01:45:44,070
What the fuck, Jim?

2024
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:47,098
[sighs]

2025
01:45:47,323 --> 01:45:49,400
What the fuck? This is bullshit.

2026
01:45:52,267 --> 01:45:53,757
Right? This isn't true.

2027
01:45:53,905 --> 01:45:57,144
[scoffs] Right?

2028
01:45:58,093 --> 01:46:01,918
Kevin, you're gonna hear

2029
01:46:02,208 --> 01:46:03,565
and you're gonna fucking read

2030
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,310
a lot of bullshit about me...

2031
01:46:06,378 --> 01:46:08,714
a lot of nasty things.

2032
01:46:08,951 --> 01:46:12,917
And most of it, if not all
of it, is fucking untrue.

2033
01:46:12,952 --> 01:46:15,124
It's pure fiction.

2034
01:46:15,659 --> 01:46:17,529
You know me.

2035
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:20,197
And you know these people.

2036
01:46:20,252 --> 01:46:23,007
You know these fucking people.

2037
01:46:23,048 --> 01:46:24,983
They're liars.

2038
01:46:27,137 --> 01:46:29,902
They know no fucking code of honor.

2039
01:46:33,112 --> 01:46:36,385
How many envelopes of fucking cash

2040
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:39,570
did you deliver to these Feds?

2041
01:46:39,605 --> 01:46:43,465
How many cases of wine
for that prick Morris?

2042
01:46:43,507 --> 01:46:45,308
Or fucking vacations,

2043
01:46:45,348 --> 01:46:49,926
or, uh, fucking money,
money, money, fuck it.

2044
01:46:56,585 --> 01:46:59,685
Does that sound like
what an informant does?

2045
01:47:01,534 --> 01:47:03,593
Guy ran a sports and numbers racket

2046
01:47:03,648 --> 01:47:06,843
out of Heller's Cafe,
parlayed it into loan sharking,

2047
01:47:06,878 --> 01:47:09,303
and that into money laundering.

2048
01:47:09,405 --> 01:47:11,618
Says he can give us some big fish.

2049
01:47:11,731 --> 01:47:12,862
Evidence?

2050
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:14,657
Pictures and sound.

2051
01:47:15,267 --> 01:47:16,903
FBI know anything about this?

2052
01:47:16,938 --> 01:47:18,622
No, but I can call them if you want.

2053
01:47:18,657 --> 01:47:20,467
Absolutely not.

2054
01:47:20,626 --> 01:47:23,195
Can you get me into witness protection?

2055
01:47:23,230 --> 01:47:24,964
Depends what you have.

2056
01:47:24,999 --> 01:47:26,724
I have Whitey Bulger.

2057
01:47:26,779 --> 01:47:29,661
So, Whitey Bulger took a
piece of everything you made?

2058
01:47:29,732 --> 01:47:31,571
What, are you fucking kidding me?

2059
01:47:31,658 --> 01:47:33,869
Everything. Wasn't small either.

2060
01:47:33,904 --> 01:47:36,369
Yeah, Whitey introduced drugs to Southie.

2061
01:47:36,424 --> 01:47:38,097
White stuff, brown stuff.

2062
01:47:38,132 --> 01:47:42,013
Cocaine, heroin, marijuana.

2063
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:44,036
MAN: Like I said, I
was a half a block away,

2064
01:47:44,071 --> 01:47:46,597
but it was no mistaking what was going on.

2065
01:47:46,635 --> 01:47:48,271
I don't know who it was.

2066
01:47:48,306 --> 01:47:50,172
Pulled him out of a car and
shot him on the fucking...

2067
01:47:50,207 --> 01:47:51,911
right on the ground.

2068
01:47:55,872 --> 01:47:57,945
It's everything...

2069
01:47:58,021 --> 01:48:03,368
extortion, racketeering, murder.

2070
01:48:04,082 --> 01:48:06,214
They got you on all of it.

2071
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:09,201
And I guess they got me, too.

2072
01:48:11,661 --> 01:48:13,664
You used me, Jimmy.

2073
01:48:14,271 --> 01:48:17,761
It was an alliance, John, nothing more.

2074
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:20,199
[sighs]

2075
01:48:20,915 --> 01:48:22,563
I'll call you in a week.

2076
01:48:22,689 --> 01:48:24,689
Just let me know what you know.

2077
01:48:24,757 --> 01:48:27,271
There's nothing more I'm gonna know.

2078
01:48:28,250 --> 01:48:29,669
Ever.

2079
01:48:36,331 --> 01:48:37,831
Okay.

2080
01:48:46,981 --> 01:48:49,632
