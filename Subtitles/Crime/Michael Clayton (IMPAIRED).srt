What options?
I'm not hearing any options!

Great. That's it?
That's what you got for me?

the state police barracks.

You take that, you add the fog,
you add the lamps, you add the angle...

What the fuck is he doing running in
the middle of the street at midnight, huh?!

They work them hard,

Six years of scheming and stalling
and screaming, and what have I got?

He's got some champagne.

405

what is that? That's 24 times 30.

I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.

we'll talk about it.

444
04:59:48,887 --> 04:59:53,551
<i>We came back from the hospital</i>
<i>and everybody was crying...</i>

445
04:59:53,726 --> 04:59:57,753
<i>... and we were in shock, but we still...</i>
<i>We had to milk.</i>

446
04:59:57,930 --> 05:00:00,364
<i>The cows won't wait, will they?</i>

447
05:00:00,532 --> 05:00:01,521
<i>No.</i>

448
05:00:02,234 --> 05:00:04,725
<i>And when you went to the barn?</i>

449
05:00:04,903 --> 05:00:07,497
<i>We found the note. My sister found it.</i>

450
05:00:07,673 --> 05:00:09,903
<i>- From your mother?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

MAN 1:
<i>Could you read it for us, please?</i>

452
05:00:12,778 --> 05:00:16,407

<i>just the highlighted section there.</i>

453
05:00:17,149 --> 05:00:19,845
<i>"I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy</i>

<i>... that I love you more than anything</i>
<i>in the world. And this is my moment.</i>

466
05:00:52,251 --> 05:00:56,051
<i>This strange conference-table moment.</i>

467

MAN 2:
<i>Turn off that camera!</i>

468

[KAREN CLEARS THROAT]

05:01:30,255 --> 05:01:31,552
When do we get Don?

476
05:01:32,157 --> 05:01:34,682
She said to try back in half an hour.

477
05:01:34,860 --> 05:01:37,761
And how about the flights?
What's the story at O'Hare?

478
05:01:38,997 --> 05:01:41,625
- Closed four minutes ago.
- Shit.

479
05:01:43,001 --> 05:01:45,401
There is a foot of snow
in Detroit already.

Todd, could I get that coffee now?

481
05:01:50,042 --> 05:01:54,172
Who is this guy they sent from New York?
Clayton? I never heard of him.

482
05:01:55,981 --> 05:01:57,414
Michael Raymond Clayton.

05:02:29,414 --> 05:02:32,815
And then in 1990, he starts
at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

493
05:02:32,985 --> 05:02:34,418
So he's a partner?

494
05:02:35,320 --> 05:02:37,811
No. He's listed as special counsel.

495
05:02:37,990 --> 05:02:40,015
Says he specializes in wills and trusts.

496

[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

500
05:03:04,182 --> 05:03:06,446
- Hi.
- Close the door.

501
05:03:06,919 --> 05:03:10,912
All right. So nobody, none of you,
had any idea he was coming?

502
05:03:11,490 --> 05:03:13,355
To Milwaukee? For a deposition?

503
05:03:13,525 --> 05:03:17,086
We thought there was a settlement
in the works. There's been some rumors.

504
05:03:17,262 --> 05:03:21,858
Okay. Look, it's very simple.
Arthur has a chemical imbalance.

505
05:03:22,034 --> 05:03:25,902
He's supposed to be taking his medication.
He's fallen behind on that.

506
05:03:26,071 --> 05:03:28,562
He's back on the mend.
He'll be fine in three or four days.

507
05:03:28,740 --> 05:03:32,904
Now, I wanna make this crystal clear.
What happened here stays in this room.

508
05:03:33,078 --> 05:03:36,047
This is not a piece of information
you wanna be out in front of.

509
05:03:36,214 --> 05:03:39,513
Anybody has a problem with that,
I need to know right now.

510
05:03:40,652 --> 05:03:42,017
All right.

511
05:03:42,888 --> 05:03:44,719
We're stuck here overnight.

512
05:03:44,890 --> 05:03:47,188
I'm gonna take him
home tomorrow if I can.

Who's in charge of
the deposition schedule?

514
05:03:49,428 --> 05:03:51,157
- I am.
MICHAEL: Where do we stand with that?

515
05:03:51,330 --> 05:03:53,525
I guess it's on hold.
We didn't know what to do.

516
05:03:53,699 --> 05:03:55,758
Nothing is on hold.
Keep doing what you were.

517
05:03:55,934 --> 05:03:58,198
Other side wants to talk about it,
they can call New York.

518

- I need his briefcase.
- Arthur's? I don't... I didn't see it.

519
05:04:01,607 --> 05:04:04,701
- He said it was in the room.
- It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.

520
05:04:05,077 --> 05:04:06,669
Find it.

521
05:04:12,651 --> 05:04:16,951
HENRY: So all these people,
they all start having these dreams, okay?

522
05:04:17,122 --> 05:04:21,525
You know what a vision quest is?
You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?

ARTHUR [OVER PHONE]:
<i>Yeah. I think so. Like a...</i>

<i>Like a special dream.</i>

525
05:04:27,366 --> 05:04:31,928
HENRY: Except this is like a whole bunch
of people having the same dream.

526
05:04:32,104 --> 05:04:35,505
They're all having this dream
that they should go to this one place.

527
05:04:35,674 --> 05:04:37,699
They don't know why or anything.

528
05:04:37,876 --> 05:04:41,004
They just have this feeling
that they have to go there.

529
05:04:41,179 --> 05:04:43,044
ARTHUR:
<i>That they've been summoned.</i>

530
05:04:43,215 --> 05:04:44,443
That's the chapter.

531
05:04:44,616 --> 05:04:47,585
Seriously, that's what it's called:
"Summons to Conquest."

532
05:04:47,753 --> 05:04:49,050
<i>That's the title.</i>

533
05:04:49,221 --> 05:04:54,887
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know
they're all having the same dream?

534
05:04:55,060 --> 05:04:57,028
<i>No. That's what's so cool.</i>

535
05:04:57,562 --> 05:04:59,496
They all think it's just them.

536
05:04:59,665 --> 05:05:03,726
That maybe they're, like, going crazy
or something, so they don't wanna admit it.

537
05:05:03,902 --> 05:05:06,029
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?

538
05:05:06,204 --> 05:05:09,696
<i>No. It's real. It's really happening.</i>

539
05:05:09,875 --> 05:05:13,504
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?

540
05:05:14,713 --> 05:05:19,377
Something larger than themselves
and they're not ready, are they...

541
05:05:19,551 --> 05:05:21,348
...to hear it?

542
05:05:21,520 --> 05:05:23,420
Yeah. But later they will.

543
05:05:23,588 --> 05:05:26,421
So if you're gonna read it,
I don't wanna spoil it.

05:05:28,026 --> 05:05:29,857
What are you doing?
Who you talking to?

GERALD: <i>Henry, it's after 11.</i>

HENRY:
<i>I gotta get off now.</i>

549
05:05:40,405 --> 05:05:44,398
No. Wait, wait. The book.
I need the book. The title.

550
05:05:45,010 --> 05:05:47,240
The book is <i>Realm and Conquest.</i>

551
05:05:47,412 --> 05:05:49,175
ARTHUR:
Realm and Conquest.

552
05:05:49,347 --> 05:05:52,407
- It's Book One, with the red cover.
- Henry, give me the phone.

553
05:05:52,584 --> 05:05:55,144
I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?

554
05:05:56,021 --> 05:06:00,424
Yeah. Yeah. Thank... Thank... Thank...
Thank you, Henry, thank you.

555
05:06:04,629 --> 05:06:08,065
<i>Realm and Conquest.</i> Thank you.

556
05:06:31,289 --> 05:06:33,314
Karen? Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.

557
05:06:33,492 --> 05:06:34,959
- You're late.
- I know.

558
05:06:35,127 --> 05:06:37,652
I'm sorry, it was more complicated
than we thought.

559
05:06:37,829 --> 05:06:39,524
Where is he?
We've been here since 5:30.

560
05:06:39,698 --> 05:06:41,859
- He's asleep.
- Well, wake him up.

561
05:06:42,033 --> 05:06:44,297
That's not gonna happen.
We just got him sedated.

562
05:06:44,803 --> 05:06:47,829
Once he gets back
on his regular medication...

563
05:06:48,006 --> 05:06:49,940
...then it's just a matter of time.

564
05:06:50,108 --> 05:06:52,872
- Have you seen the video? The tape?
- I heard about it.

565
05:06:53,145 --> 05:06:55,613
What happened after is worse.

566
05:06:55,781 --> 05:06:59,683
This is in the parking lot, okay?
People running for their cars.

567
05:06:59,851 --> 05:07:01,978
He's there in his socks, nothing else.

568
05:07:02,154 --> 05:07:05,817
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I will not sit with this sickness any longer.

569
05:07:05,991 --> 05:07:08,789
I cannot aid this sickness any longer."

570
05:07:08,960 --> 05:07:10,552
What does this mean?

571
05:07:10,962 --> 05:07:12,520
I'm not sure.

572
05:07:12,697 --> 05:07:15,325
You've been with him the whole evening.
What's he saying?

573
05:07:15,500 --> 05:07:17,297
He wasn't really making much sense.

574
05:07:17,469 --> 05:07:19,027
This is totally unacceptable.

575
05:07:19,204 --> 05:07:22,139
This is a 3-billion-dollar
class-action lawsuit.

576
05:07:22,307 --> 05:07:24,241
In the morning, I have to call my board.

577
05:07:24,409 --> 05:07:28,971
I have to tell them that the architect
of our entire defense has been arrested...

578
05:07:29,147 --> 05:07:33,311
...for running naked in a snowstorm,
chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.

579
05:07:33,485 --> 05:07:35,282
I understand.

580
05:07:36,354 --> 05:07:38,379
What sickness is he talking about?

581
05:07:38,557 --> 05:07:41,185
- I don't know. It could be anything.
- Well, give me one.

582
05:07:41,359 --> 05:07:42,656
Frostbite.

583
05:07:43,161 --> 05:07:44,788
You think this is funny?

584
05:07:44,963 --> 05:07:47,227
Look, his wife was sick
and she died last year.

585
05:07:47,399 --> 05:07:51,859
His daughter doesn't talk to him.
He's all alone. All he does is your case.

586
05:07:52,037 --> 05:07:54,733
He skipped his pills.
He had a bad day. That's it.

587
05:07:54,906 --> 05:07:57,602
And you're somehow
the authority on this?

588

- But you're feeling better now?
- Yeah.

890
05:28:07,051 --> 05:28:09,542
- Much better, definitely.
- Not enough to call me back.

891
05:28:09,720 --> 05:28:12,951
Well, I was trying to,
um, gather my thoughts...

892
05:28:13,123 --> 05:28:16,718
...before I called you,
and that's what I was doing.

893
05:28:17,361 --> 05:28:18,760
And how's that going?

894
05:28:18,929 --> 05:28:21,397
Yes, it's good, very good. I just...

895
05:28:21,698 --> 05:28:27,102
Well, I just need to make my thoughts
a little bit more precise. That's...

896
05:28:27,271 --> 05:28:28,568
That's my goal.

897
05:28:28,739 --> 05:28:32,106
As good as this feels,
you know where it goes.

898
05:28:32,276 --> 05:28:33,675
No. No. You're wrong.

899
05:28:33,844 --> 05:28:36,938
What makes this feel good
is that I don't know where it goes.

900
05:28:38,115 --> 05:28:41,278
How do I talk to you, Arthur?
So you hear me?

901
05:28:41,452 --> 05:28:45,980
Like a child? Like a nut?
Like everything's fine?

902
05:28:46,156 --> 05:28:49,922
What's the secret?
Because I need you to hear me.

903
05:28:50,094 --> 05:28:52,858
- Well, I hear everything.
- Then hear this.

904
05:28:53,297 --> 05:28:57,256
You need help.
Before this goes too far, you need help.

905
05:28:57,434 --> 05:28:58,662
You got great cards here.

906
05:28:58,836 --> 05:29:02,169
If you keep your clothes on, you can
do any goddamn thing you want.

907
05:29:02,339 --> 05:29:05,570
You want out, you're out.
You wanna bake bread, go with God.

908
05:29:05,742 --> 05:29:08,438
There's only one wrong answer
in this whole goddamn pile...

909
05:29:08,612 --> 05:29:10,375
...and you've got
your arms around it.

910
05:29:10,547 --> 05:29:13,846
- Well, I said I was sorry.
- You thought the hotel was overwhelming?

911
05:29:14,017 --> 05:29:16,577
You piss on this case,
they'll cut you off at the knees.

912
05:29:16,753 --> 05:29:20,018
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm covering for you.

913
05:29:20,190 --> 05:29:23,682
I'm telling them everything's fine.
You're fine. Everybody's cool.

914
05:29:23,861 --> 05:29:27,092
I'm out running this "price of genius" story
to anybody who'll listen.

915
05:29:27,264 --> 05:29:31,496
And then I wake up this morning and I hear
you're calling this girl from Wisconsin...

916
05:29:31,668 --> 05:29:33,533
...messing with documents
and whatever else.

917
05:29:33,704 --> 05:29:36,229
- How can you know that?
- They're gonna take everything.

918
05:29:36,406 --> 05:29:39,898
Your partnership, your equity.
They're gonna pull your license.

919
05:29:40,077 --> 05:29:42,238
- How do you know I called Anna?
- Marty told me.

920
05:29:42,412 --> 05:29:46,178
- Well, how does he know?
- I don't know. I don't give a shit!

921
05:29:49,887 --> 05:29:51,821
- You're tapping my phone.
- Jesus, Arthur.

922
05:29:51,989 --> 05:29:53,854
Then explain it.
Tell me how Marty knows!

923
05:29:54,024 --> 05:29:58,893
Because you're chasing a girl through
a parking lot with your dick hanging out.

924
05:29:59,062 --> 05:30:01,895
You think she didn't get off the phone
and dial her attorney?

925
05:30:02,065 --> 05:30:03,930
No. She wouldn't do that. I know that.

926
05:30:04,101 --> 05:30:07,093
Really? You think your judgment
is state-of-the-art right now?

927
05:30:08,572 --> 05:30:12,872
They're putting everything on the table.
You need to stop and think this through.

928
05:30:13,043 --> 05:30:14,567
I'll help you think this through.

929
05:30:14,745 --> 05:30:16,975
I'll find somebody to help you
think it through.

930
05:30:17,648 --> 05:30:21,311
Don't do this.
You're making it easy for them.

931
05:30:22,986 --> 05:30:26,149
Michael, I have great affection for you.

932
05:30:26,323 --> 05:30:30,623
You lead a very rich and interesting life,
but you're a bagman, not an attorney.

933
05:30:31,228 --> 05:30:33,059
If you wanted to have me committed...

934
05:30:33,230 --> 05:30:37,098
...you should have kept me in Wisconsin,
where the arrest report, the videotape...

935
05:30:37,267 --> 05:30:39,929
...and eyewitness accounts
of my inappropriate behavior...

936
05:30:40,103 --> 05:30:42,071
...would have had
jurisdictional relevance.

937
05:30:42,239 --> 05:30:44,639
I have no criminal record
in the state of New York.

938
05:30:45,075 --> 05:30:50,342
And the single determining criterion
for involuntary incarceration is danger.

939
05:30:50,514 --> 05:30:53,881
Is the defendant a danger
to himself or others?

940
05:30:54,051 --> 05:30:56,747
You think you got the horses for that?

941
05:30:56,920 --> 05:30:59,650
Well, good luck and God bless.
But I tell you this:

942
05:31:00,924 --> 05:31:05,054
The last place you want to see me
is in court.

943
05:31:05,896 --> 05:31:07,727
I'm not the enemy.

944
05:31:08,232 --> 05:31:10,257
Then who are you?

945
05:31:22,913 --> 05:31:24,813
NARRATOR:

955
05:32:49,633 --> 05:32:52,864
WOMAN: <i>You've reached the voicemail of</i>

956
05:32:53,036 --> 05:32:54,901
<i>Please leave your message</i>
<i>after the tone.</i>

957
05:32:55,706 --> 05:32:56,866
Yes!

958
05:32:57,207 --> 05:33:01,075
Here we are, all together.
Is everyone listening?

959
05:33:01,244 --> 05:33:04,680

"Conclusion:

964
05:33:19,329 --> 05:33:21,991
The unanticipated market growth
for Culcitate...

965
05:33:22,165 --> 05:33:27,398
...by small farms in colder climates

<i>Would you guys like</i>
<i>a little bit of legal advice?</i>

967
05:33:31,408 --> 05:33:34,275
Never let a scientist
use the words "unanticipated"...

968
05:33:34,444 --> 05:33:37,538
...and "immediate"
in the same sentence.

969
05:33:37,714 --> 05:33:39,545
Okay? Okay.

970
05:33:39,716 --> 05:33:42,150
<i>"In-house field studies</i>
<i>have indicated...</i>

971

...significant enough to cause
serious human tissue damage."

974
05:33:55,632 --> 05:33:58,032
Well, this is a long way of saying that...

975
05:33:58,201 --> 05:34:01,534
...you don't even have to leave your house
to be killed by our product.

976
05:34:01,705 --> 05:34:03,764
We'll pipe it into your kitchen sink.

...these potentially lethal exposures."

981
05:34:15,886 --> 05:34:17,683
Now, I love this.

982
05:34:17,854 --> 05:34:19,754
Not only is this a great product...

983
05:34:19,923 --> 05:34:23,620
...it is a superb cancer delivery system.

984

"It's going to cost a fortune to go back
on this, and I'm just an asshole in a lab...

- It seemed to warrant my coming to...
- Yes.

999
05:35:20,217 --> 05:35:21,844
You have to contain this.

1000
05:35:23,587 --> 05:35:25,817
- Contain?
- Right.

1001
05:35:26,356 --> 05:35:28,415
Well, that's my question.

1002
05:35:29,192 --> 05:35:33,526
What are the?
What's the option that we're looking at?

1003
05:35:33,697 --> 05:35:35,528
Along those lines.

1004
05:35:35,699 --> 05:35:38,725
You're talking about the paper, the data?
I don't...

1005
05:35:39,636 --> 05:35:44,073
Well, I'm wondering
if there is some other option.

1006
05:35:44,241 --> 05:35:46,106
I mean something I'm not thinking of?

1007
05:35:46,843 --> 05:35:48,811
We deal in absolutes.

1008
05:35:48,979 --> 05:35:51,880
Okay. I understand that. I do.

1009
05:35:52,048 --> 05:35:57,486
The material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer.
We try, we do what we can.

1010
05:35:57,654 --> 05:35:59,485
Well, the other way?

1011
05:36:01,525 --> 05:36:03,390
Is the other way.

1012
05:36:07,297 --> 05:36:09,788
- Maybe you wanna bring Don in on this.
- No.

1013
05:36:09,966 --> 05:36:13,458
This has nothing to do with Don. He's busy.
This has nothing to do with Don.

1014
05:36:20,410 --> 05:36:22,207
Do you think it's doable?

1015
05:36:23,680 --> 05:36:26,945
Yeah. We have some good ideas.
You say move, we move.

1016
05:36:27,117 --> 05:36:30,211
If the ideas don't look so good,
we back off, reassess...

1017
05:36:30,387 --> 05:36:31,718
Okay.

1018
05:36:35,759 --> 05:36:39,251
Is that, "Okay, you understand,"
or "Okay, proceed"?

PEOPLE:

Go on, Dad, make a wish.

You're a maniac. Unbelievable.

05:37:08,758 --> 05:37:10,623
All right, Eddie.

Happy birthday.

Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.

1033
05:37:20,570 --> 05:37:23,130
- You going in?
- Mm-hm.

1034
05:37:23,306 --> 05:37:25,467
- I'm late already.
- Shit.

1035
05:37:25,642 --> 05:37:27,041
You're not both running out?

1036
05:37:27,210 --> 05:37:28,973

No. Fuck Timmy.

Hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.

WOMAN:
<i>Who is this?</i>

1195
05:50:17,183 --> 05:50:20,675
Michael Clayton. I'm an attorney in

- Excuse me?

You get her all the way to New York City
and then leave her at the airport?

<i>This is not a complicated person.</i>

<i>- No, you wait.</i>

She's coming home tomorrow

I don't know. I'll watch the door.
You check his car. Let's get some details.

1216
05:52:01,320 --> 05:52:04,585
He didn't want to say
exactly what it was.

1217
05:52:06,459 --> 05:52:10,293
Just that when I got here,
he would pick me up...

1218
05:52:10,463 --> 05:52:12,829
...and show me, and I would see...

1219

...that it was something
that would win the whole case.

1220

Even this morning...

1221
05:52:21,908 --> 05:52:23,500
...I mean, I thought:

1222

"Okay, if I get to the airport
and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.

Okay, you're stupid,
and you can go home now."

You think maybe he was
in some way disappointed?

But your machine must be

We gave it our best shot.

Right about what?
That we're on the wrong side?

Wrong side, wrong way,
everything, all of it.

This is news?
This case reeked from day one.

What would they do if he went public?

1317
06:02:52,371 --> 06:02:55,772
What would they do? Are you fucking soft?
They're doing it.

1318
06:02:55,941 --> 06:02:58,375
We don't straighten the settlement out
in 24 hours...

1319
06:02:58,544 --> 06:03:00,603
...they're gonna withhold
$9 million in fees.

1320
06:03:00,779 --> 06:03:03,748
Then they'll pull out the video of Arthur
doing his flashdance.

1321
06:03:03,916 --> 06:03:05,645
They'll sue us for legal malpractice.

1322

Except there won't be anything to win
because the London merger will be dead...

1323
06:03:09,655 --> 06:03:12,317
...and we'll be selling off
the goddamn furniture.

1324
06:03:12,791 --> 06:03:14,486
That's 80.

1325

We're calling it a bonus.

Three-year contract
at your current numbers.

1327
06:03:19,831 --> 06:03:21,458
That's assuming this all works out.

1328
06:03:21,633 --> 06:03:22,793
You're doing this now?

1329
06:03:24,469 --> 06:03:27,802
Look, I agreed to this, okay?
But there's rules now.

1330
06:03:27,973 --> 06:03:30,840
You want the contract,
you sign a confidentiality agreement.

1331
06:03:31,009 --> 06:03:33,102
It's gonna be bulletproof
and retroactive.

1332
06:03:33,278 --> 06:03:35,007
Because Marty's too nice to say it...

1333
06:03:35,180 --> 06:03:38,980
...but with all you know about this place,
the clients and people who work here...

1334
06:03:39,151 --> 06:03:41,711
...it makes it a little weird
when you ask for 80 grand.

1335
06:03:42,387 --> 06:03:45,083
If I was gonna shake anybody down,
I'd come to you...

1336
06:03:45,257 --> 06:03:47,919
...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand.
Is this him or you?

1422
06:15:25,690 --> 06:15:30,627
KAREN: <i>It has been and it remains</i>
<i>the U/North position...</i>

1423
06:15:30,795 --> 06:15:34,891
<i>... that this lawsuit is baseless</i>
<i>and without merit.</i>

1424
06:15:35,066 --> 06:15:39,127
Our reluctance to negotiate
was anchored by this belief...

1425
06:15:39,304 --> 06:15:44,469
...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand
for settlement...

1426
06:15:44,642 --> 06:15:47,202
...in excess of 3 billion dollars.

1427
06:15:47,378 --> 06:15:50,836
The reason that we are
all here today is...

1428
06:15:51,015 --> 06:15:54,883
...that several key elements
in the case have changed.

1429
06:15:55,887 --> 06:16:00,324
<i>You all have</i>
<i>a tentative proposal packet...</i>

1430
06:16:00,925 --> 06:16:04,884
<i>... which outlines the details,</i>
<i>but the bottom line is this:</i>

1431
06:16:05,063 --> 06:16:07,827
<i>Over the past several months</i>
<i>we had gotten word...</i>

1432
06:16:07,999 --> 06:16:11,332
...that the plaintiffs were
growing impatient...

1433
06:16:11,502 --> 06:16:15,336
...and were in the process
of revising their settlement numbers.

1434
06:16:15,840 --> 06:16:17,307
<i>We also learned...</i>

1435
06:16:17,475 --> 06:16:21,411
<i>... that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees</i>
<i>were capped at 32 percent...</i>

1436
06:16:21,579 --> 06:16:23,672
<i>... up to 400 million dollars...</i>

1437
06:16:24,115 --> 06:16:28,347
...above which,
their fees dropped to 24 percent.

1438
06:16:28,519 --> 06:16:33,081
So we knew that there would be
this motivational dead zone for them...

1439
06:16:33,257 --> 06:16:34,588
...in the middle there.

1440
06:16:35,360 --> 06:16:37,055
<i>Finally...</i>

1441
06:16:37,228 --> 06:16:41,562
...our finance team informed us
that they had run the numbers...

1442
06:16:41,733 --> 06:16:43,564
...and that the tax benefit...

1443
06:16:43,735 --> 06:16:46,966
...provided that we bring
the settlement in under 600 million...

1444
06:16:47,138 --> 06:16:49,572
...and within this fiscal year...

1445
06:16:49,741 --> 06:16:55,611
...that the write-off on this settlement
would essentially pay for itself.

1446
06:16:56,114 --> 06:17:00,312
<i>The package that you have before you</i>
<i>represents, in my judgment...</i>

1447
06:17:00,752 --> 06:17:05,553
<i>... the strongest possible position for</i>
<i>our company under the circumstances.</i>

1448
06:17:05,723 --> 06:17:07,418
<i>And, as chief counsel...</i>

1449
06:17:07,592 --> 06:17:10,857
...it is my recommendation
that this proposal be confirmed.

Thank you, Karen. If you just give us
a few minutes to talk about it.

Well...

1453
06:17:44,429 --> 06:17:46,260

What do you think I'm doing?

The suit's over. We have a deal.

1462

Whatever that is,
it's meaningless at this point.

all those checks.

I'm calling Marty.

which I doubt, I highly doubt...

1471
06:18:41,853 --> 06:18:45,289

- It's protected. It belongs to U/North.

1472
06:18:45,456 --> 06:18:48,220
- I know you killed him.
- It's attorney-client privilege.

goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?

1479

Don't you know who I am?
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.

I do everything from shoplifting housewives
to bent congressmen...

...and you're gonna kill me?

a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?

and a contract and you're gonna kill me?

06:19:28,633 --> 06:19:30,066
What do you want?

1486
06:19:30,234 --> 06:19:31,758
What do I want?

1487
06:19:31,936 --> 06:19:33,528
I want more.

1488
06:19:34,038 --> 06:19:35,801
I want out.

1489
06:19:35,973 --> 06:19:38,601
And with this, I want everything.

1490
06:19:40,378 --> 06:19:41,606
Is there a number?

1491
06:19:41,779 --> 06:19:43,371
Ten is a number.

1492
06:19:43,548 --> 06:19:45,573
Ten? Ten what?

1493
06:19:47,618 --> 06:19:49,108
Ten million?

1494
06:19:49,287 --> 06:19:52,723
Where do you think I'm gonna get
10 million dollars?

1495
06:19:53,291 --> 06:19:55,191
You know what's great about this?

1496
06:19:55,359 --> 06:19:57,657
Did you read it to the end?
You see who signed it?

1497
06:19:58,229 --> 06:20:00,129
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...

1498
06:20:00,298 --> 06:20:03,290
...if he wants to pass the hat
for a worthy cause.

1499
06:20:05,136 --> 06:20:07,536
This would have to be
a longer conversation...

1500
06:20:07,705 --> 06:20:09,832
...and would have to take place
somewhere else.

1501
06:20:10,007 --> 06:20:11,497
Where? My car?

1502
06:20:13,077 --> 06:20:14,101
All right.

1503
06:20:15,279 --> 06:20:18,305
I'm gonna make it easy. Let's make it 5.

1504
06:20:18,482 --> 06:20:20,279
Five and I'll forget about Arthur.

1505
06:20:22,653 --> 06:20:27,420
Five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something
that we could talk about.

1506
06:20:27,592 --> 06:20:31,323
Good. And then the other 5 is
to forget about the 468 people...

1507
06:20:31,495 --> 06:20:33,588
...that you knocked off
with your weed killer.

1508
06:20:33,764 --> 06:20:36,130
Let me finish up this meeting.
I'll talk to Don...

1509
06:20:36,300 --> 06:20:38,894
Do I look like I'm negotiating?!

1510
06:20:39,070 --> 06:20:40,401
DON:
Karen?

1511
06:20:41,105 --> 06:20:42,970
KAREN: One second.
- Everything okay?

1512
06:20:44,342 --> 06:20:45,331
Yes.

1513
06:20:46,344 --> 06:20:50,144
Ten million dollars. Bank of my choosing.
Offshore. Immediately.

1514
06:20:50,314 --> 06:20:51,440
- Yes.
- Say it!

1515
06:20:51,616 --> 06:20:55,484
Ten million dollars, your account,
the moment this meeting is through.

1516
06:20:55,653 --> 06:20:57,951
DON: Karen! Everyone's waiting.
KAREN: I'm coming, Don.

1517
06:20:58,990 --> 06:21:00,355
You have a deal.

1518
06:21:00,925 --> 06:21:02,187
You're so fucked.

1519
06:21:02,526 --> 06:21:03,857
What?

1520
06:21:04,362 --> 06:21:06,227
- You're fucked.
- What do you mean?

1521
06:21:06,397 --> 06:21:08,627
- Take a wild guess.
DON: Is there a problem?

1522
06:21:08,799 --> 06:21:11,495
- I don't understand.
- Let me get a picture while I'm at it.

1523
06:21:11,669 --> 06:21:14,467
- You don't want the money?
- Keep the money. You'll need it.

1524
06:21:14,639 --> 06:21:16,231
Is this fellow bothering you?

1525
06:21:16,407 --> 06:21:17,635
Am I bothering you?

1526
06:21:17,808 --> 06:21:21,835
DON: Karen, I've got a board waiting in there.
What the hell's going on? Who are you?

1527
06:21:22,013 --> 06:21:23,708
I'm Shiva, the god of death.

1528
06:21:23,881 --> 06:21:27,510
DON: Ron! Ronny, I need security
out here immediately.

1529
06:21:28,419 --> 06:21:29,681
All right. Here we go.

1530
06:21:29,854 --> 06:21:33,051
That guy right there, stop him.
Grab that guy.

1531
06:21:34,659 --> 06:21:35,853
What are you doing?

1532
06:21:36,027 --> 06:21:37,756
DALBERTO:
We're detectives with the N.Y.P.D.

1533
06:21:37,928 --> 06:21:39,896
Come back with us
and we'll explain everything.

1534
06:21:40,064 --> 06:21:43,329
Check on her. Make sure she doesn't need
any medical attention.

1535
06:21:43,501 --> 06:21:45,662
You guys go into the ballroom.
Nobody leaves.

1536
06:21:45,836 --> 06:21:47,599
Have your guys cover every exit.

1537
06:21:47,772 --> 06:21:50,570
DON: Will you please explain to me
what's going on here?

1538
06:21:51,208 --> 06:21:52,573
Did you get all that?

1539
06:21:52,743 --> 06:21:54,938
Yeah. Got it.

1540
06:21:58,582 --> 06:22:01,415
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just gotta get some air.

1541
06:22:01,585 --> 06:22:03,075
Sure.

1542
06:22:03,454 --> 06:22:06,218
Just stay close, okay?

1543
06:22:06,390 --> 06:22:07,618
Okay.

1544
06:23:18,262 --> 06:23:20,093
DRIVER:
So, what are we doing?

1545
06:23:27,171 --> 06:23:29,162
Give me 50 dollars' worth.

1546
06:23:31,041 --> 06:23:32,702
Just drive.

1547
06:29:17,955 --> 06:29:19,946
