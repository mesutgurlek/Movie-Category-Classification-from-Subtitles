769
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:22,110
 well, you don't know 

770
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:25,180
I was comin' back from,
um, a motorcycle classic...

771
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,280
In a place called sturgis, south dakota,

772
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:31,080
And on my motorcycle on u.S. Highway 14,

773
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:34,380
On just that side of spotted
horse, I ran into a deer.

774
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:38,360
I hit a deer. I had no chance. 
Even though the highway patrol had--

775
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,690
Highway people had
mowed the sides--

776
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,930
Where the culverts
were, they couldn't mow.

777
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:46,360
And this doe just jumped right
in front of the bike ! [ gasps ]

778
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:49,000
I had a chance to say one word.

779
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,100
It was, "fuck !" and I hit it.

780
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:54,700
I know this: If the bullet's coming
my way, and I see my name on it,

781
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:57,710
I won't be calling for my
mother. [ both chuckling ]

782
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:01,080
But, man, I tell ya, I think the only reason
I'm alive and telling this story now...

783
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:06,650
Is because of the big f.L. Front end
and that solid tire on my fat boy.

784
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,620
Oh, your fat boy. Yeah.

785
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,950
Exactly.  I was wearing-- it
was the fat boy. [ chuckles ]

I saw the ground, and I
thought, "mmm, put it down."

787
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,530
And I just rode the bike
down into the ground.

788
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:19,100
Just perfect-- you told
me this story before.

I'm sorry.

you want. Oh, you're sweet.

Nothing. It must be hard
to pass on this road, huh ?

794
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:40,180
Oh, the freeway's faster, but
it lacks a certain majesty.

795
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:46,220
It's just the car behind us has
been following us for a while.
