00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:29,382
The first time I met Ed...

5
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:32,053
was in the county lockup
in Tempe, Arizona.

Don't forget his profile, Ed.

What kind of name is Ed
for a pretty thing like you?

00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:46,443
ED: Short for Edwina.
Turn to the right!

You're a flower, you are.

13
00:00:49,655 --> 00:00:51,783
Just a little desert flower.

Let me know how those come out.

15
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:58,457
HI: Prison life
is very structured...

more than most people
care for...

17
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:04,004
but there's a spirit of
camaraderie between the men...

18
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:06,674
like you find
only in combat, maybe...

19
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:10,136
or on a pro ball club in
the heat of the pennant drive.

20
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:11,805
Grrrr!

21
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:13,807
HI: In an effort
to better ourselves...

22
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:15,725
we were forced to meet
with a counselor...

23
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:20,064
who tried to help us figure out
why we were the way we were.

24
00:01:20,106 --> 00:01:23,192
SCHWARTZ: All he wanted
was a hot roll and butter.

25
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:24,903
So...

26
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:27,447
why do you use the word
"trapped"?

27
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:28,782
Huh?

28
00:01:28,824 --> 00:01:33,245
Why do you say you feel trapped
in a man's body?

29
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:37,874
Well, sometimes I get
the menstrual cramps real hard.

would you?

00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:47,636
MAN: OK, then.

35

HI: I tried to stand up
and fly straight...

36
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:54,477
but it wasn't easy with Reagan
in the White House.

What's the matter, Ed?

My "fy-ance" left me.

had run off...

with a student cosmetologist...

46
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:22,383

I think he's a damn fool, Ed.

HI: I can't say I was happy
to be back inside...

but the flood of familiar
sights, sounds, and faces...

60
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,637
almost made it feel
like a homecoming.

61
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:05,931
Most men your age are getting
married and raising a family.

prison as a substitute.

care to comment?

no meat, we ate fowl.

When there was no fowl,
we ate crawdad.

When there was no crawdad

whether it's for rehabilitation
or revenge...

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,713

89
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:14,549
revenge is the only argument

They say that absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

my thoughts turned to Ed...

the pain of imprisonment.

106

CELLMATE: Mama would throw
the live crawdad...

107

in a pan of boiling water.

108
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,523
One day, I decided to make
my own crawdad...

109
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:09,945
and I threw it in a pot
without the water, you see?

110
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:12,072
And it was just like
making popcorn.

111

by the sandman.

Not actually practicing,
you understand.

147

this spherical object...

00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:53,142
resting in the highway...

153

the job was a lot like prison...

except Ed was waiting
at the end of every day...

156

and a paycheck
at the end of every week.

00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:12,331
the salad days, as they say.

Her point was that there was

for just the two of us...

and we worked at it most
other days, just to be sure.

could find no purchase.

HI: But biology
and the prejudices of others...

188

conspired to keep us childless.

Our love for each other
was stronger than ever...

Now, y'all without sin

1111
01:02:58,971 --> 01:03:01,766
when you got something
to clobber a guy with.

I'll give you a day

Dot will be around tomorrow

you still got each other.

1425
01:26:16,234 --> 01:26:20,447
Sir...those are
kind words, but...

1426
01:26:20,489 --> 01:26:24,743
I think the wife and I
are splitting up.

1427
01:26:24,785 --> 01:26:27,329
Her point is that
we're both kind of...

1428
01:26:28,164 --> 01:26:30,250
selfish and unrealistic...

1429
01:26:30,291 --> 01:26:33,169
so we ain't too good
for each other.

1430
01:26:33,878 --> 01:26:37,757
Well, ma'am,
I don't know much...

1431
01:26:37,799 --> 01:26:39,468
but I do know human beings.

1432
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:42,973
You brought back my boy...

1433
01:26:43,014 --> 01:26:46,852
so...you must have
your good points, too.

1434
01:26:50,564 --> 01:26:53,150
Sure hate to think
of Florence leaving me.

1435
01:26:54,986 --> 01:26:59,157
I...do...love her so.

1436
01:27:05,539 --> 01:27:06,665
Ahem.

1437
01:27:08,584 --> 01:27:11,838
You can go out
the way you came in...

1438
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:15,633
and before you go off and do
another foolish thing...

1439
01:27:15,675 --> 01:27:17,927
like bustin' up...

1440
01:27:17,969 --> 01:27:20,431
I suggest you sleep on it...

1441
01:27:21,806 --> 01:27:23,350
at least one night.

1442
01:27:25,936 --> 01:27:28,689
HI: That night I had a dream.

1443
01:27:29,565 --> 01:27:32,235
I dreamt I was as light
as the ether...

1444
01:27:33,695 --> 01:27:36,948
a floating spirit
visiting things to come.

1445
01:27:38,576 --> 01:27:41,871
The shades and shadows
of the people in my life...

1446
01:27:41,913 --> 01:27:44,332
rassled their way
into my slumber.

1447
01:27:46,292 --> 01:27:50,339
I dreamt that Gale and Evelle
had decided to return to prison.

1448
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:52,716
Probably that's just as well.

1449
01:27:52,758 --> 01:27:54,510
I don't mean to sound
superior...

1450
01:27:54,551 --> 01:27:57,597
and they're
a swell couple guys...

1451
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:01,976
but maybe they weren't ready yet
to come out into the world.

1452
01:28:04,313 --> 01:28:06,857
And then I dreamed on...

1453
01:28:06,899 --> 01:28:08,609
into the future...

1454
01:28:09,568 --> 01:28:12,530
to a Christmas morn
in the Arizona home...

1455
01:28:13,405 --> 01:28:15,992
where Nathan Junior
was opening a present...

1456
01:28:16,034 --> 01:28:18,036
from a kindly couple...

1457
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,330
who preferred to remain unknown.

1458
01:28:22,708 --> 01:28:25,711
I saw Glen
a few years later...

1459
01:28:25,795 --> 01:28:28,548
still having no luck
getting the cops to listen...

1460
01:28:28,589 --> 01:28:31,259
to his wild tales
about me and Ed.

1461
01:28:33,345 --> 01:28:36,515
Maybe he threw in
one Polack joke too many.

1462
01:28:37,307 --> 01:28:39,101
I don't know.

1463
01:28:40,937 --> 01:28:43,398
And still I dreamed on...

1464
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:48,445
further into the future
than I'd ever dreamed before...

1465
01:28:49,612 --> 01:28:52,783
watching Nathan Junior's
progress from afar...

1466
01:28:53,826 --> 01:28:57,580
taking pride
in his accomplishments...

1467
01:28:57,621 --> 01:28:59,249
as if he were our own...

1468
01:29:00,292 --> 01:29:03,795
wondering
if he ever thought of us...

1469
01:29:04,588 --> 01:29:08,425
and hoping maybe we'd broadened
his horizons a little...

1470
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:12,638
even if he couldn't remember
just how they got broadened.

1471
01:29:15,057 --> 01:29:18,562
But still I hadn't dreamt
nothing about me and Ed...

1472
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,106
until the end.

1473
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:24,277
And this was cloudier...

1474
01:29:25,111 --> 01:29:29,324
'cause it was years...
years away...

1475
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:35,164
but I saw an old couple being
visited by their children...

1476
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:38,209
and all
their grandchildren, too.

1477
01:29:39,710 --> 01:29:42,172
The old couple
wasn't screwed up...

1478
01:29:43,215 --> 01:29:46,802
and neither were their kids
or their grandkids.

1479
01:29:46,843 --> 01:29:48,470
Dad.

1480
01:29:48,512 --> 01:29:52,557
HI:
And I don't know. You tell me.

1481
01:29:53,392 --> 01:29:54,936
This whole dream...

1482
01:29:56,479 --> 01:29:58,272
was it wishful thinking?

1483
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:04,988
Was I just fleeing reality
like I know I'm liable to do?

1484
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:07,449
But me and Ed...

1485
01:30:09,327 --> 01:30:10,994
we can be good, too.

1486
01:30:12,330 --> 01:30:14,040
And it seemed real.

1487
01:30:15,793 --> 01:30:17,710
It seemed like us...

1488
01:30:18,461 --> 01:30:19,922
and it seemed like...

1489
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:22,717
well...

1490
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:24,051
our home.

1491
01:30:25,928 --> 01:30:30,767
If not Arizona,
then a land not too far away...

1492
01:30:32,185 --> 01:30:36,314
where all parents are
strong and wise and capable...

1493
01:30:37,358 --> 01:30:40,236
and all children
are happy and beloved.

1494
01:30:42,488 --> 01:30:43,698
I don't know.

1495
01:30:46,368 --> 01:30:48,035
Maybe it was Utah.

1496
01:30:49,913 --> 01:30:51,916
