Christmas, as you're probably aware,

for young Micky here.

Because on Christmas Day,

60
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,966
I have made plans
that he be taken from the jail in Banyon

and hanged by the neck until he is dead.

You're a copper, Stanley,
not a judge and jury.

Well, clearly, Mr Burns,
I am what I wish to be.

65
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,606
So what is it that you want?

66

Touch my brother again and I'll kill you.

84
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,110
Make no mistakes, Mr Burns.

85
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,155
It will be done. I will civilise this place.

86
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,282
What the fuck
are you talking about, Stanley?

87

93
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,349
I wish to present you with a proposition.

94
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,565
STANLEY:
I know where Arthur Burns is.

95
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,777
It is a godforsaken place.

96
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,994
The blacks won't go there,
nor the trackers.

97
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,912
Not even my own men.

98
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:40,669
I suppose, in time,
the bounty hunters will get him.

99
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,258
But I have other plans.

100
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,343
I aim to bring him down.

101
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,887
I aim to show

102
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,972
that he is a man like any other.

103
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,891
I aim to hurt him.

104
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,476
When you're ready, sir.

105
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,815
STANLEY: And what will most hurt him?

106
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,360
Hmm.

107
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,572
Well, I've thought
long and hard about that.

108
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,076
And I have realised, Mr Burns,

109
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:17,122
that I must become
a little more inventive in my methods.

110
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,631
Now, don't speak, Mr Burns.
Listen to me now.

111
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,674
Don't say a word.

112
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,930
Now, suppose I told you there was a way

113
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,433
to save your little brother
Mikey from the noose.

114
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,771
Suppose I gave you a horse<i>...</i>and a gun.

115
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,610
Suppose, Mr Burns,

116
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,863
I was to give both you
and your young brother, Mikey, here,

117
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,907
a pardon.

118
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:58,413
Suppose I said that I could give you

119
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,999
the chance to expunge the guilt<i>...</i>

120
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,627
<i>...</i>beneath which you so clearly labour.

121
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,964
Suppose I gave you till Christmas.

122
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:13,053
Now, suppose you tell me
what it is I want from you.

123
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,596
Hmm?

124

00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,255
<i>...</i>you wait outside.

168
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,350
We spoke about
why you shouldn't come here.

169
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,893
This is not appropriate<i>...</i>

170
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,062
Morris, you've been gone for three days.

171
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,942
It's lonely up there at the house.

172
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,362
It's so quiet without you.

173
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,072
Are you coming home now?

174
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,616
Well, I have things to attend to.

175
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:12,579
I'll have Officer Dunn escort you home.

176
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,414
I'll be back soon.

177
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,416
You look terrible, Morris.

178
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,918
Yes.

179
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,881
Yes, I do.

180
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,679
STANLEY: Dunn.

181
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,389
MARTHA: Who is that?

182
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,059
But he's no more than a boy.

183
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,979
He's man enough, ma'am.
He's man enough, indeed.

184
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,939
STANLEY: Enough.
(Dunn sniggers)

185
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:49,491
Escort Mrs Stanley home
and wait there till I return.

186
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,410
How long will you be, dear?

187
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,911
Later.

188
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,549
Never speak to my wife
about such things again.

189
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,426
Do you understand?
My apologies, Captain.

190
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:10,971
What happened today on the flats,
that's between you and me.

191
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,806
Of course, sir.

192
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,475
Because there would be consequences
were it to become common knowledge.

193
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,644
Yes.

194
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,658
(Snores softly)

195
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,911
MARTHA: Eliza Hopkins
was a good Christian woman,

196
00:17:15,911 --> 00:17:17,788
and she was my friend.

197
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:21,333
I pray to God that her death
was mercifully swift.

198
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,585
It was, wasn't it?

199
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:27,756
Martha, can we speak of other things?

200
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,468
Come here, Captain Stanley.

201
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,532
Mmm.

202
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:56,910
My poor husband.

(Groans)

204
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,131
MARTHA: Oh.

205
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,932
The world you live in in there.

206
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:25,272
(Stanley breathes raggedly)

207
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,316
Don't be gloomy, dear.

208
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,362
This burden you carry<i>...</i>

209
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,366
<i>...</i>you might let me carry it too.

210
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,413
(Whispers) I believe in you.

218
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:35,092
There's nothing to see here, Martha.
Go back to bed.

Officer Dunn has shot his t<i>...</i>

220

(Laughs)

00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:11,563
Oh, a thousand pardons, my dear man.

237
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:15,234
It appears that I am a little scuppered.

238
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:19,613
Oh, no need for that, sir.
No need for that.

239
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,782
We are white men, you and I.

240
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:25,911
Permit me to introduce myself.

241
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,914
My name is Jellon Lamb.

242
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:31,208
Citizen of the world, you might say.

243
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,876
An adventurer.

244
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:38,674
And, if I may be so bold,
a man of no little education.

245
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,094
And you, sir?

246
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:46,473
By what name
am I honoured to address thee?

247
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:54,314
Of course, a<i>...</i> mere detail.

248
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,026
Mere detail.

249
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,823
Forgive me, sir, but I've been stuck here

250
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:07,661
with no-one but this sorry sack
of Hibernian pig shit for conversation.

251
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:12,624
Poor, poor Dan O'Reilly.

252
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,543
Sit, sir. Drink with me.

253
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:17,379
(Cocks gun)

254
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,591
One more crack about the Irish,
Mr Lamb, and I'll shoot you.

255
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:22,134
Am I clear?

256
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:24,636
Oh, as the waters of Ennis, sir.

257
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,680
Let us drink, then, to the Irish.

258
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,059
No finer race of men
have ever<i>...</i> peeled a potato.

259
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,272
Do you pray, Mr Lamb?
Good Lord, son.

260
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:37,191
No, I do not.

261
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,360
I was, in days gone by, a believer.

262
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,948
But, alas, I came
to this beleaguered land

263
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,992
and the God in me just<i>...</i>

264
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,370
<i>...</i>evaporated.

265
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,208
Let us change our toast, sir.

266
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,919
To the God who has forgotten us.

267
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,965
But first<i>...</i>

268
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:04,593
<i>...</i>cardinal rule.

269
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:10,307
Never raise a glass with a man
whose name you do not know.

270
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,978
My name is Charles Murphy.

271
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,994
Charles, eh?

272
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:32,538
Perhaps you've read

273
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:35,499
'On The Origin Of The Species
By Means Of Natural Selection'

274
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,417
by Charles Darwin.

275
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,086
Oh, don't be thrown by the title.

276
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:43,340
He had some most fascinating
things to say.

277
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,133
Chilling things.

278
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:51,098
Mr Darwin spent time
studying Aboriginals.

279
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:55,477
He claims we are, at bottom,

280
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:58,647
one and the same.

281
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:00,691
(Laughs)

282
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:06,697
He infers, Mr Murphy,

283
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:11,869
that we share
a common ancestry with monkeys.

284
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:15,831
(Laughs)

285
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:18,166
Monkeys!

286
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,253
(Laughs)

287
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:28,010
Mr Murphy, Russia, China, the Congo.

288
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,972
Oh, I have travelled
among unknown people

289
00:24:31,972 --> 00:24:34,641
in lands beyond the seas.

290
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,479
But nothing<i>...</i>

291
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,690
<i>...</i>nothing could have prepared me

292
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,860
for this godforsaken hole.

293
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,697
You see<i>...</i> Mr Murphy<i>...</i>

294
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:54,286
<i>...</i>I am something of a fortune hunter.

295
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:02,211
And what fortune do you hunt
out here, Mr Lamb?

296
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:04,254
That would be my question
to you, Mr Murphy.

297
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:08,383
Unhand me, Murphy, or I'll slit
your fucking throat.

298
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,689
We are white men, sir.

299
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,069
Not beasts.

300
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:40,707
(Coughs)

301
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:45,629
LAMB: Ah!

302
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:50,467
He sits up there
in those melancholy hills.

303
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:56,223
Some say he sleeps in caves
like a beast.

304
00:25:56,223 --> 00:26:00,227
Slumbers deep like the kraken.

305
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:04,565
The blacks say that he's a spirit.

306
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:07,568
The troopers will never catch him.

307
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:11,655
Common force
is meaningless, Mr Murphy,

308
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:17,202
as he squats up there
on his impregnable perch.

309
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:24,168
So I wait, Mr Murphy.

310
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:28,755
I wait<i>...</i> Arggh!

311
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:37,723
Aye, you wait.

312
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:39,766
You wait here, bounty hunter.

313
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:54,448
MAN: Hang him, sir.
MAN 2: Hang him high, sir.

314
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:13,133
Hail the conquering hero.

315
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:29,983
What a vile specimen of humanity.

316
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,738
What a little piece of filth.

317
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:38,867
Not really the one that
we're looking for, though, is it, Captain?

318
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,161
In the end, justice will be done.

319
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,622
Mm. Justice.

320
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:47,125
Save your little wisdoms
for the mob, Stanley.

321
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,672
Has he told you where his brothers are?

322
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,924
With due respects, Mr Fletcher,

323
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:56,009
perhaps it would be wise
to allow police work

324
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,636
to be done by policemen.

325
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:00,305
Hmm.

326
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,478
What a little piece of filth.

327
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:12,901
Still, better than nothing, I suppose.

328
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,779
Good evening, Captain.
Good evening.

329

00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:31,909
Him much better now.
Him much better because I fixed him.

491
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:33,410
He don't look better to me.

492
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:37,331
You know, Samuel, the thing
I relished the most while I was away

493
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:40,459
was not having to see
your fuckin' face all the time.

494
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:43,378
If it weren't for me and my crack
shooting, you'd be fuckin' dingo dinner.

495
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:46,298
30 yards away, I was, and<i>...</i>
(lmitates gunshot)

496
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:49,176
Blew that black bastard's head right off.

497
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:50,844
It was beautiful.

498
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:55,015
Show a bit of respect
or I might just have to shoot <i>you...</i>

499
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:56,767
<i>...</i>with my new Winchester.

500
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,522
Fuck! That hurt!

501
00:42:06,235 --> 00:42:09,321
(Breathes heavily)

502
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:32,010
(FLIES BUZZ)

503
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:06,587
Aw, Charlie.
Go easy there.

504
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:08,088
It's alright, Charlie.

505
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:14,011
Do you want to know
why I've come back?

506
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:16,430
I know why you've come back, Charlie.

507
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,641
Look at that.

508
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:28,609
Be humble of heart, Charlie.
This is the end of things.

509
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:30,360
You're my brother, Charlie.

510
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,862
You belong with me.

511
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,240
We are a family.

512
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,117
All of us.

513
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:39,745
Yeah, I was just getting reacquainted.

514
00:43:39,745 --> 00:43:41,872
Samuel.

515
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:45,876
Oh, be kind. A little tolerance, Charlie.

516
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:47,419
Samuel's a boy.

517
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:48,962
He's a vicious little cretin.

518
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:51,632
(Chuckles)

519
00:44:02,643 --> 00:44:04,186
Where's Mikey, Charlie?

520
00:44:04,186 --> 00:44:06,396
Mikey stayed behind in Clarence.

521
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:08,857
You left Mikey alone?
He met a girl.

522
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:13,946
Mikey met a girl?
Aye.

523
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:16,406
Mikey met a girl.
(Chuckles)

524
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:24,790
What's her name, Charlie?
Molly.

525
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,667
Molly.

526
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:29,169
Molly O'Boyle.

527
00:44:29,169 --> 00:44:30,671
Molly O'Boyle.

528
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,593
A red-headed colleen, no doubt.

529
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:38,470
Aye. Red.

530
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,430
Like the sunset.

531
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:43,016
Like the sunset.

532
00:44:57,698 --> 00:45:00,909
What does she do,
this<i>...</i> Molly O'Boyle?

533
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:02,870
(Sighs)

534
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:06,582
I'm feeling a bit tired right now, Arthur.

535
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:09,168
Is she a farmer's daughter?
Can she cook a good lamb stew?

536
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,669
Would you stop it?

537
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,175
(Groans wearily)

538
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:23,265
ARTHUR: Mikey's not
the same stuff as us.

539
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:25,726
We'll be flung to the depths, you and I.

540
00:45:26,977 --> 00:45:28,520
He worships you, you know.

541
00:45:30,314 --> 00:45:32,357
CHARLIE: There was a time
we both did.

542
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:45,204
Mikey deserves better.

543
00:45:45,204 --> 00:45:48,081
You were right to leave -
take him with you.

544
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:52,252
I need to rest.

545
00:45:52,252 --> 00:45:54,713
ARTHUR: Mary O'Boyle.

546
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:57,090
CHARLIE: Molly, Arthur. Molly.

547
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,219
ARTHUR: Molly. Molly. Right. Molly.

548
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:17,152
(Grunts)

549
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:21,406
(Moans in pain)

550
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:26,578
(Gasps for breath)

551
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:32,042
(Softly) Mikey, Mikey.

552
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:35,546
(Men sing) # On the fifth day
of Christmas

553
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:38,882
# My true love gave to me

554
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:42,344
# Five cats a-flogging

555
00:46:42,344 --> 00:46:45,806
# Four nooses swinging

556
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:49,810
# Three crows a-pecking

557
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:53,730
# Two dogs a-pissing

558
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,608
# And little Mikey

559
00:46:56,608 --> 00:47:00,195
# Hanging from a pear tree. #

560
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:01,738
(Both men snigger)

561
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:03,866
Only five more days to go, Mikey.

562
00:47:15,878 --> 00:47:17,796
STANLEY: Martha.

563
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:21,175
Martha.

564
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:26,221
When Sergeant Lawrence said<i>...</i>

565
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:30,684
<i>...</i>that the boy that you are holding
at the lock-up was man enough<i>...</i>

566
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:33,770
<i>...</i>what did he mean by that?

567
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:37,983
Sergeant Lawrence is an ignorant thug
with the moral fortitude of a snake.

568
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,611
Just disregard<i>...</i>
What did he mean?

569
00:47:40,611 --> 00:47:42,654
What did the boy do?

570
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,198
He's a member of the Burns gang.

571
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:46,283
There are certain things
a woman should not be privy<i>...</i>

572
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:47,951
I know that. I asked you a question.

573
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:49,828
I asked you not to visit me at work.

574
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:51,538
Tell me what he did to Eliza.
Enough.

575
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:54,416
She was my friend!
Enough!

576
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,378
STANLEY: That's enough.

577
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,718
Headache, Captain Stanley?

578
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:15,312
So, what can I do for you, Mr Fletcher?

579
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:26,740
Word has it that your men captured
half a dozen rebel blacks two days ago,

580
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,784
and that one was shot in the process.

581
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:33,580
Do you have a problem with that?

582
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:36,708
Yes, Captain, I do.

583
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:39,169
Word came this morning
from Eight Mile Creek

584
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:41,839
that Dan O'Reilly's place was attacked.

585
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,423
Are you sure it was blacks?

586
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:45,509
Dan O'Reilly had so many spears in him

587
00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:49,304
that he resembled your good old
garden variety English hedgehog.

588
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,474
It's simple, Captain.

589
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:55,227
It's called the law of reciprocity.

590
00:48:55,227 --> 00:48:59,356
Kill one of them and they're
going to kill one of ours.

591
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:04,236
Do the job I brought you
here to do, hmm?

592
00:49:04,236 --> 00:49:06,488
If you have to kill one,

593
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,782
make sure you bloody well kill them all.

594
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:11,952
Well, I'll send some troopers out today.

595
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:19,835
Well, is our business here finished?

596
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:23,338
I'm going to have Mike Burns flogged.

597
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:25,424
What?
100 lashes.

598
00:49:25,424 --> 00:49:27,009
(DOOR OPENS)

599
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:32,097
Martha.

600
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:33,932
Thank you.

601
00:49:33,932 --> 00:49:36,310
I thought you gentlemen
might like a little tea.

602
00:49:37,394 --> 00:49:38,896
Please, sit down.

603
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:43,692
FLETCHER: Thank you, Martha.
That would be lovely.

604
00:49:47,237 --> 00:49:48,739
Thank you, Martha.

605
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:08,217
Is there anything else I can get you?

606
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:10,802
No, thank you, Martha. This is lovely.

607
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:16,558
Well, then, I'll leave
you two gentlemen alone.

608
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:34,743
A clever and well-bred woman,
your wife.

609
00:50:36,495 --> 00:50:38,747
You did well for yourself, Captain.

610
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:45,921
Word has it<i>...</i>

611
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:47,965
<i>...</i>that you had Charlie Burns.

612
00:50:49,758 --> 00:50:51,301
And you let him go.

613
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:57,432
Word has it<i>...</i>that you offered him
some kind of deal.

614
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:59,476
Tell me this isn't so, Captain.

615
00:51:00,602 --> 00:51:02,688
FLETCHER: Word has it
that you promised

616
00:51:02,688 --> 00:51:06,024
those animals who raped
Eliza Hopkins a pardon

617
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:08,360
if Charlie Burns
brought back his brother.

618
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,738
A pardon for the annihilation
of the Hopkins family.

619
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:14,825
Are you completely out of your mind?

620
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:17,661
STANLEY: Listen to me.
Mike Burns is a simpleton.

621
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:20,455
He spends all day in his cell,
crying like a child.

622
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:23,292
It is my belief that he is
not responsible for his actions.

623
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:26,461
I'm not interested in
your beliefs, Captain Stanley.

624
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:28,630
Who do you think you are?
The judge and jury?

625
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,632
Arthur Burns must be stopped.

626
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:33,969
It is he who is responsible
for this outrage.

627
00:51:33,969 --> 00:51:38,015
And I know that Charlie Burns
will stop at nothing

628
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:40,267
to protect his younger brother Mike.

629
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:44,646
So all we need do now is wait.

630
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:46,857
FLETCHER: Wait?

631
00:51:46,857 --> 00:51:49,526
My God, man. They raped a woman.

632
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:52,321
Tomorrow morning,
I want Mike Burns flogged.

633
00:51:56,158 --> 00:51:58,327
As I said, 100 lashes.

634
00:51:58,327 --> 00:52:00,537
This will kill him.
So be it.

635
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:02,915
But what if I'm right?

636
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:07,377
What if Charlie Burns does as I ask?
What if he comes back?

637
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:09,671
Then we will hang the lot of them.

638
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:15,427
Good day.

639
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:28,857
STANLEY: Martha.

640
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:32,277
Martha. Stay here.

641
00:52:32,277 --> 00:52:35,155
Do not let anyone in.
I shall return tomorrow.

642
00:52:37,074 --> 00:52:39,493
Martha! Do you hear me?

643
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:41,286
Please. Stay here.

What's going on in here?

I believe Officer Davenport
and Officer Matthews

were entertaining the prisoner, sir.

Is that right, Sergeant?
Yes, sir.

I've kept it from you.

I'm in a room.

<i>...</i>I stand up and I turn around<i>...</i>

is Eliza Hopkins.

and I look down and I see

890

that the baby has taken hold of my finger

891
01:13:21,693 --> 01:13:24,738
and it's squeezing it tight in its tiny fist.
