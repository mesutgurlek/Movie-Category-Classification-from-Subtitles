you do for a living you pack a shotgun?

more banks than anybody in the computer.

under different circumstances...

235
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:23,632
if you were in a bar and
I came up and we started talkin'...

- You'd probably tell me.

under different circumstances...

was Three Days of the Condor.

Now, you get your clothes cleaned,
you send me the bill.

I'll send it to you at Glades.

What, did you crawl through
a sewer, man? Who're you?

- Take your sunglasses off.
- I see better with 'em on, man.

I'm gonna throw them off
while they're still on your head.

to bring the clean clothes.

- What's your problem, Jack?
- I don't know why you got Glenn
involved in this.

293
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:54,541
- How 'bout the score was
his idea to begin with?
- Idea...

294
00:23:54,611 --> 00:23:56,670
The guy's got a fuckin'
vacant lot for a head.

295
00:23:56,747 --> 00:24:00,683
He thinks he can talk
to me like that? Shit.

296
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:05,687
"Gimme your jacket." I have been
sitting here for over a half-hour,

297
00:24:05,755 --> 00:24:09,555
watchin' out for the Highway Patrol,
if you think that's fun.

298
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:13,083
God. You know, I hadda go
over there in the bushes...

299
00:24:13,162 --> 00:24:17,496
to smoke a joint, just so I could like,
[Whistles] you know?

300
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:22,367
Yep. I got somethin'
big lined up, up north.

301
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:26,772
Yeah, these guys? Wouldn't even fuckin'
know about it if it wasn't for me.

302
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:30,300
- Every time he opens his mouth,
I wanna punch him out.
- He's not the problem, Jack.

303
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:33,348
You wanna pull your head
outta your ass, tell me why the hell
we're bringing her with us?

304
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,646
- Glenn.
- [Mumbling]

305
00:24:35,718 --> 00:24:38,016
You don't remember me, do you?

306
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:44,754
Um, couldn't have been Glades
if that's what you're thinkin',
'cause I was never out there.

307
00:24:44,826 --> 00:24:48,626
- No, that's not what I'm thinking.
- Oh, yeah?

308
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:52,189
But you're sure
we've met, huh?

309
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:53,962
- Last fall.
- [Chuckles]

310
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:59,098
I drove you from the Palm Beach County
Jail to the federal courthouse... twice.

311
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:01,506
You're Glenn Michaels.

312
00:25:01,576 --> 00:25:04,306
I never forget anybody
I've cuffed and shackled.

313
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:07,075
Now let's think about this for a minute,
Glenn, see if we can't work it out.

314
00:25:07,148 --> 00:25:10,811
Do we have a gun in the car?

315
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:13,718
Oh, shit!
I remember you! Hey!

316
00:25:13,788 --> 00:25:17,086
Foley's not gonna make it,
and if he goes down, you go with him.

317
00:25:17,157 --> 00:25:19,990
- Now, look. I can understand
if you guys are close, but...
- No, we're not.

318
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:25,293
- But, yeah. I'm helpin' him.
- Now wait a minute, Glenn.

319
00:25:25,366 --> 00:25:27,300
Have you helped him?

320
00:25:27,368 --> 00:25:31,532
I mean, technically,
at this point, I doubt you could be
charged with aiding a fugitive.

321
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:33,573
So you still have a choice.

322
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,633
You wanna take her to my place, get
cleaned up, come out of the bathroom...

323
00:25:37,711 --> 00:25:40,805
with your aftershave on, and she goes,
"Oh. I had you all wrong."

324
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:42,815
No. I just wanna talk
to her again, that's all.

325
00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:46,683
I just wanna see what it might have
been like under normal circumstances.

326
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,187
- It's too late for that, Jack.
- [Car Engine Starting]

327
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:51,621
He wants to get out of here,
and I don't blame him.

328
00:26:11,177 --> 00:26:14,476
[Crowd Cheering]

329
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:34,388
Ref don't call it soon, Snoop's gonna
send this cat out in a body bag.

330
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:38,563
Anybody ever tell you
why they call him "Snoopy"?

331
00:26:40,772 --> 00:26:43,332
He used to be
Maurice "Mad Dog" Miller...

332
00:26:43,408 --> 00:26:45,876
back when he was a pro.

333
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:49,514
Now you pet him,
he goes down.

334
00:26:55,754 --> 00:26:58,722
- I don't believe it!
- Oh, my!

335
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:03,158
[Crowd Chattering, Booing]

336
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:06,025
[Crowd Chanting]
Bullshit! Bullshit!

337
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:11,527
Yeah, you the man.

338
00:27:16,907 --> 00:27:18,875
Guy's bragging he won
a thrown fight.

339
00:27:18,943 --> 00:27:20,877
Fuckin' pathetic.

340
00:27:24,715 --> 00:27:26,649
Dangerous is what it is.

341
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:33,756
- Who's the bald dude?
- Richard Ripley.

342
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:36,257
The Wall Street guy?

343
00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:39,056
Call him Dick The Ripper on account
of all the guys he ripped off.

344
00:27:39,128 --> 00:27:42,359
Oh, yeah. I didn't
recognize him without his rug.

345
00:27:42,432 --> 00:27:44,457
- What's his bid?
- Three years.

346
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:47,594
You guys on the bench? Okay.

347
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:51,731
Three years, fined $50 million
and wrote 'em a fuckin' check.

348
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:53,776
Just like that.

349
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:56,505
[Straining]
Fifty mill, signed his name.

350
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:59,673
Didn't even... Didn't even...
Okay, a little help.

351
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:01,580
Okay, heavy!
[Grunting]

352
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:03,585
Heavy! Come on!

353
00:28:05,255 --> 00:28:07,188
[Grunting]

354
00:28:07,256 --> 00:28:11,158
All the bright glare out here,
you couldn't read the numbers
on the weights.

355
00:28:11,226 --> 00:28:14,093
Oh. I had it. Jesus.

356
00:28:14,162 --> 00:28:17,928
- How do you know he wrote a check?
- Uh, he told me.

357
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,594
We work laundry together.

358
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:22,933
[Grunts]
Guy loves to fucking talk.

359
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:26,202
Yeah, he loves to talk.
He talked to the U.S. Attorney.

360
00:28:26,275 --> 00:28:28,800
Rolled over on all the snitches
he was doing business with.

361
00:28:28,877 --> 00:28:33,280
Hey! Any guy who can write
a fuckin' check for $50 million,

362
00:28:33,348 --> 00:28:36,943
he says anything,
I'm all fuckin' ears.

363
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:40,954
Guy tells me he's got
all this money in foreign banks.

364
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:43,422
Plus, around, mmm,

365
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:47,359
five million in uncut diamonds
at his house.

366
00:28:47,428 --> 00:28:49,362
He said, quote,

367
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,297
that I can get my hands on it
at any time.

368
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:54,596
- Where does he live?
- Detroit.

369
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:59,834
Snoopy Miller says that uncut diamonds
are as easy to move as cash.

370
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:04,675
Ever seen
an uncut diamond, Studs?

371
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,543
Looks just like
a plain, old rock.

372
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:11,676
- Wait, you think this guy's lying?
- [Chuckling]

373
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:17,387
What do you think, Studs? Use
your head. Some guy's got $5 million...

374
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:22,087
socked away in his house,
and he's gonna tell some motormouth
he just met in prison about it.

375
00:29:23,496 --> 00:29:26,021
Oh, I see.
You guys are cynical. Right.

376
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,911
Here it comes.

377
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,356
Keep on walking. Keep walking.

378
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,827
You don't wanna be
answering any questions.

379
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,735
I'm just saying
she wasn't scared, that's all.

380
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,071
That's 'cause she had
her hand on her gun the whole time
waitin' to make her move.

381
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,976
You're just jealous 'cause
it was me in the trunk with her...

382
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,980
- and not you.
- You're right.

383
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:19,848
The first thing I'm gonna do...
is get this mud off me.

384
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:55,701
Hey.

385
00:32:24,572 --> 00:32:26,665
[Mr. Sisco]
Karen?

386
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:27,867
Karen, honey?

387
00:32:29,144 --> 00:32:32,443
Karen?

388
00:32:32,514 --> 00:32:34,846
You were talking
in your sleep.

389
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:36,850
[Sighs]

390
00:32:39,721 --> 00:32:41,881
What'd I say?

391
00:32:41,955 --> 00:32:43,889
"Hey, yourself."

392
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:48,851
- Huh.
- [Knock At Door]

393
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:51,454
[Karen]
Hello, Daniel.

394
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:56,702
[Groaning]

395
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:01,207
Daniel Burdon, F.B.I.

396
00:33:01,275 --> 00:33:03,675
Marshall Sisco, Karen's dad.

397
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,678
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

398
00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:07,680
Umm...

399
00:33:07,748 --> 00:33:10,876
Would you mind, please,
waiting outside?

400
00:33:10,951 --> 00:33:13,044
We have some business
to do here.

401
00:33:15,355 --> 00:33:17,720
Well, uh, I have
to use the john anyway.

402
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,724
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

403
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:27,758
I wanna be
on the task force, Daniel.

404
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:30,132
Well...

405
00:33:30,203 --> 00:33:34,697
That's nice of you
to offer, Karen, but...

406
00:33:34,774 --> 00:33:38,835
I got all the help
I can use right now.

407
00:33:38,911 --> 00:33:43,371
Instead, let's talk about
how you got that bump on your head.

408
00:33:43,449 --> 00:33:45,917
Isn't that my file
you're holding on to?

409
00:33:45,985 --> 00:33:49,182
Yes, but I want
to hear it from you,

410
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:52,781
starting... with when
you grabbed the wheel.

411
00:33:52,858 --> 00:33:55,691
Where was this?

412
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,694
Coming to the Okeechobee exit.

413
00:33:57,762 --> 00:34:00,925
- [Glenn] Sit back!
- Can you see with those glasses on?

414
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:03,763
I'm fine!
This is... stupid, man.

415
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:06,269
These guys are gonna be
so disappointed in me, man.

416
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:08,670
You know what?
If I wasn't stoned,

417
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,709
there is no way that you would have
talked me into this.

418
00:34:11,776 --> 00:34:14,609
- Remember that.
- Get off at the exit
right after that bridge.

419
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,240
No, I am not fucking turning
myself in, so forget it!

420
00:34:18,316 --> 00:34:20,409
- Get off at that exit!
- What exit?

421
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:22,885
- That exit right there. Take that exit!
- Sit back! No!

422
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:32,754
[Karen's Voice]
The next thing I knew,

423
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:36,231
the paramedics were
pulling me out of the car.

424
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,133
- You all right?
- [Daniel] There's a couple
of points I keep wondering about...

425
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,364
have to do with the two guys
that grabbed you.

426
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:45,499
Buddy, is it?
And this fella Jack Foley.

427
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:49,239
I swear, the man must have robbed
over 200 banks in his time.

428
00:34:49,313 --> 00:34:51,247
- Really?
- Um-hmm.

429
00:34:51,315 --> 00:34:53,579
He told me he didn't
remember how many he robbed.

430
00:34:53,651 --> 00:34:56,176
Then you talked to him.

431
00:34:56,253 --> 00:34:58,619
In the trunk, yeah.

432
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:01,213
What'd you talk about?

433
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:03,316
Different things.

434
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:06,260
Prison, movies.

435
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:10,993
This fella holds you hostage,
you talk about movies?

436
00:35:13,303 --> 00:35:16,136
It was an unusual experience.

437
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:19,174
You know, Foley made me think
of that fella Carl Tillman.

438
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,837
The one that you were seeing,
it turns out, the same time
he was robbing banks.

439
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,346
- Do you recall that?
- And what happened to Carl?

440
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:29,351
The time came, you shot him. But you
didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.

441
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:33,981
They're unarmed, you had a shotgun
and you let them throw you in the trunk.

442
00:35:34,057 --> 00:35:36,456
Okay. Now you got
your Sig in your hand,

443
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:38,925
and you say in the report
that you couldn't turn around.

444
00:35:38,994 --> 00:35:42,293
He had you pinned down.
But when the trunk opened,

445
00:35:42,364 --> 00:35:45,060
how come you didn't
cap the two guys then?

446
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:48,500
What do you work on most of the time?
Fraud? Go after crooked bookkeepers?

447
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:53,132
Karen, I've been with the bureau
15 years on all kinds of investigations.

448
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:56,143
- Have you ever shot a man?
- No.

449
00:35:56,211 --> 00:35:59,669
- When was the last time you were
primary through the door?
- I have to qualify?

450
00:35:59,748 --> 00:36:01,739
You have to know
what you're talking about.

451
00:36:01,817 --> 00:36:04,377
[Snickering]

452
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:09,249
We'll talk another time.
All right, Karen?

453
00:36:12,093 --> 00:36:15,756
I'd like to know why Foley
put you in that second car
when he didn't need you anymore.

454
00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:20,166
You'll have to ask him that.

455
00:36:23,738 --> 00:36:27,299
[Chattering]

456
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,241
Rip, Rip.

457
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:41,311
- What the deal is, baby?
- Hi, Maurice.

458
00:36:41,389 --> 00:36:43,856
- Oops. I don't know.
- Make a fist...

459
00:36:43,923 --> 00:36:46,414
- There you go.
- Fuck it, man.

460
00:36:46,493 --> 00:36:48,688
- Got your little fishies for you.
- Oh, good.

461
00:36:48,762 --> 00:36:53,961
Not so fast. Starting out,
there's gonna be an across the board
cost of living increase.

462
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:57,561
- What?
- When I got put in here a year ago
on credit card fraud,

463
00:36:57,637 --> 00:36:59,571
I didn't really get
no props for that.

464
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:03,405
But ever since I shanked
that loudmouth pussy in the yard,

465
00:37:03,476 --> 00:37:07,970
it's like my Dun and Broadstreet around
this bitch done shot way the fuck up.

466
00:37:08,048 --> 00:37:12,007
Actually, it's Dun and Bradstreet.
That's the, uh...

467
00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:14,383
Well, I've heard it both ways.

468
00:37:14,454 --> 00:37:17,048
Point is that the price
has gone up around this bitch too.

469
00:37:17,123 --> 00:37:20,091
Get your little black book out.
We got some business to talk about.

470
00:37:22,628 --> 00:37:25,392
For the little fishies...
What'd I say they was gonna be?

471
00:37:25,464 --> 00:37:28,592
- Two thousand.
- Now they're gonna be three thousand.

472
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:31,659
- Come on. You...
- Now they're gonna be three thousand.

473
00:37:31,737 --> 00:37:33,671
[Sighing]

474
00:37:33,739 --> 00:37:36,139
That saltwater shit
you put in your eyes?

475
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:39,041
- What do you call that?
- Bausch & Lomb.

476
00:37:39,111 --> 00:37:42,205
Yeah, that bushy lawn shit.
That's 300.

477
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:45,580
- I need it.
- Yeah, you do. And that extra pillow.

478
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:48,848
I'm gonna get that for you,
but that's gonna be like five C's.

479
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:50,855
- Five?
- [Foley] Hey.

480
00:37:50,923 --> 00:37:54,358
Sign says shut the fuck up,
or can't you fellas read?

481
00:37:54,425 --> 00:37:56,586
Who the fuck
you talkin' to, man?

482
00:37:57,895 --> 00:38:00,193
You got a problem
over there, Foley?

483
00:38:00,264 --> 00:38:05,395
Yeah, this is
the dumbest fucking shakedown
in the history of dumb shakedowns.

484
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,768
- Five hundred bucks for a pillow?
- That's right.

485
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,967
- It does seem a little high,
doesn't it?
- Shut up, Dick.

486
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:13,169
- Must be a nice pillow.
- Full goose down.

487
00:38:13,244 --> 00:38:16,179
- Look, you still...
- How much for your company at chow?

488
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:19,546
My company? Come on, man. You know
I'll watch this motherfucker's back.

489
00:38:19,617 --> 00:38:22,279
- How much?
- That's a C-note.

490
00:38:24,622 --> 00:38:27,351
If you're smart, Ripley,
you'll tell this guy to fuck off.

491
00:38:27,424 --> 00:38:29,358
Really?

492
00:38:29,426 --> 00:38:32,054
Well, l... l...
I don't know.

493
00:38:32,129 --> 00:38:35,462
First of all, if he kills you,
then he's gonna get nothin'.

494
00:38:35,532 --> 00:38:38,865
Well, uh, the man don't
just have to die, Foley.

495
00:38:38,935 --> 00:38:42,962
He could accidentally hurt himself
falling down on something real hard.

496
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:46,907
Like a shiv or my dick.

497
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:49,639
I'll pay. I'll pay it.
Don't worry.

498
00:38:49,713 --> 00:38:52,079
If he falls on anything, Snoop,

499
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:55,915
then they're gonna transfer
his ass outta here faster
than you can throw a fight...

500
00:38:55,986 --> 00:38:58,216
and you're still
gonna get nothin'.

501
00:38:58,288 --> 00:39:00,847
[Laughs]
You know, last time I checked, man,

502
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:03,357
this shit over here ain't
got nothin' to do with you.

503
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,189
Why don't you go outside?
Smoke a cigarette or some shit.

504
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,526
I don't smoke.

505
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:11,361
You heard the man. Why don't
you get your punk ass up outta here?

506
00:39:11,433 --> 00:39:15,028
- Uh-oh.
- You fucked up now, man. That's Himey.

507
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:18,596
Protégé of mine. Ranked number 32
in the federal prison system.

508
00:39:18,674 --> 00:39:20,608
- Thirty-two?
- That's right.

509
00:39:20,676 --> 00:39:23,236
- Out of, what, 20.
- Kick this cracker's ass.

510
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:28,249
[Whistles]

511
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:33,181
- What's going on here?
- Uh, nothin'.

512
00:39:33,255 --> 00:39:36,883
Just "reading is fundamental" shit.
We got all excited and everything.

513
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,926
Clear outta here. Now.

514
00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:41,359
- No problem.
- All of you. Let's go.

515
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:48,368
Uh, Snoopy.
I think we settled the fish thing.

516
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:50,370
Oh, the fish. Yeah.

517
00:40:01,382 --> 00:40:03,816
That's how you
do the shake, partner.

518
00:40:09,557 --> 00:40:12,787
[Buddy]
Paper says there's ten grand each
on you, Chino and Lulu.

519
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:14,793
They say anything about Karen?

520
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:16,795
Just that she got away. Here.

521
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:18,888
- Hmm?
- Jack!

522
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:20,900
- [Man] Hey!
- That's all right. It's in the pool.

523
00:40:20,968 --> 00:40:24,028
Did it say what happened to her
after she took off with Glenn?

524
00:40:24,104 --> 00:40:26,038
I don't know.
You'll have to ask Glenn.

525
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:28,768
He's probably on his way to Detroit,
which is where we should be.

526
00:40:28,842 --> 00:40:31,834
- Yeah.
- Do you realize what you're doing?

527
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:34,312
Worrying about a woman
who works for law enforcement?

528
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:37,942
You wanna sit down and have cocktails
with a woman who tried to shoot you.

529
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,249
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Do you think this old guy's
her boyfriend?

530
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:43,255
It's the only picture
she has in here.

531
00:40:43,323 --> 00:40:45,756
Am I going to Detroit by myself?

532
00:40:45,825 --> 00:40:48,020
The longer we stay here,
the better chance there is...

533
00:40:48,094 --> 00:40:50,028
that either Glenn
is gonna screw up the score,

534
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:53,190
or we gonna get busted or both.

535
00:40:57,536 --> 00:40:59,470
[Marshall]
This is Foley?

536
00:40:59,538 --> 00:41:01,938
- Karen?
- Hmm?

537
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:06,138
- This is Foley?
- [Radio] (music) How lucky can one guy be (music)

538
00:41:06,212 --> 00:41:09,306
- (music) [Continues, Indistinct]
- Doesn't even look like that.

539
00:41:09,382 --> 00:41:13,216
- Oh, no?
- Uh-uh. He looks a lot like...

540
00:41:15,655 --> 00:41:17,589
Different.

541
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:25,361
Wyatt Earp is here.

542
00:41:32,137 --> 00:41:34,071
- Hey.
- Hey.

543
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:36,573
- How you feelin'? Feel better?
- Good. Yeah.

544
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:39,610
- Is your dad taking good care of you?
- He took the week off...

545
00:41:39,678 --> 00:41:43,239
to take care of me and he's worked on
his boat every day since.

546
00:41:43,315 --> 00:41:45,613
- Dad, this is Ray Nicolet.
- Hi.

547
00:41:45,684 --> 00:41:49,051
- Pleasure to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.
- Likewise.

548
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,521
Ray's working with the F.B.I.
Task force on the prison break.

549
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:56,457
I see that. Tell me, Ray, do you ever
wear one that says "undercover"?

550
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:01,654
- No.
- How's it going?

551
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:03,666
Sit down.

552
00:42:03,734 --> 00:42:07,261
Okay. Good.
We caught one of them.

553
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:09,329
- Was it Foley?
- Was it off a tip?

554
00:42:09,406 --> 00:42:12,898
Somebody spotted two of them
out in this hobo camp near the airport.

555
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:15,103
Called in the number.
That was it.

556
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:18,114
- I knew it as soon
as I as there was a reward.
- Was it Foley?

557
00:42:18,182 --> 00:42:21,174
No, Linares,
one of the Cubans.

558
00:42:21,251 --> 00:42:24,709
We went in there with full SWAT,
two choppers, that whole deal.

559
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:27,222
[Sighs] Linares goes nuts,
starts shooting, so we took him out.

560
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:30,225
I don't know how Chirino
got away, but he did.

561
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:33,285
- And Foley hadn't been there.
- No, this place was strictly Cuban.

562
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:37,561
Foley had a ride. He must have
his own agenda. You know what I mean?

563
00:42:37,633 --> 00:42:40,966
He seems to be the only guy
who kinda knows what he's doing.

564
00:42:41,037 --> 00:42:42,971
- Uh-huh.
- [Phone Ringing]

565
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:45,667
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

566
00:42:45,742 --> 00:42:47,733
Hello?

567
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:50,472
Yeah, she is.
Just a minute, please.

568
00:42:50,546 --> 00:42:52,480
Karen.

569
00:42:52,548 --> 00:42:55,346
- Hello?
- Hi.

570
00:42:56,786 --> 00:43:00,347
You know who this is?

571
00:43:00,423 --> 00:43:03,687
Yes. [Whispers]
Five minutes.

572
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:12,333
So. Ray.

573
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:15,097
- Yeah.
- There's something I'm wondering.

574
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:19,072
The headline reads, "I slept with
a murderer, says shaken Miami woman."

575
00:43:19,207 --> 00:43:22,267
- Who is it that answered the phone?
- None of your business.

576
00:43:22,344 --> 00:43:25,245
I'm just worried maybe
I'm not old enough for you.

577
00:43:25,313 --> 00:43:28,771
- It was my dad.
- Really?

578
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,843
- He's got a cop's face.
- How do you know?

579
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:36,686
- Oh, wait. You have my wallet.
- And your gun.

580
00:43:36,757 --> 00:43:39,123
- Think I can have 'em back?
- How do we do that?

581
00:43:39,193 --> 00:43:42,128
You can come by my dad's place
and drop 'em off.

582
00:43:42,196 --> 00:43:45,029
I could leave it with the SWAT guy
that answers the door.

583
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:47,829
There's a guy here
on the task force right now.

584
00:43:47,902 --> 00:43:50,427
Maybe I should put him on the phone
and let the two of you work it out.

585
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:52,699
- You wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

586
00:43:52,773 --> 00:43:56,368
Because you're having
too much fun.

She fixes him pork chops and rice.

588
00:43:58,446 --> 00:44:01,210
The next thing you know,
they're making love on the sofa.

589
00:44:01,282 --> 00:44:03,273
She says he was very gentle.

590
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:07,116
This guy, Chirino, shows up at the
house, says he misses his little girl.

591
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:10,816
She feels sorry for him.
Next thing you know... boom.

592
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:13,916
- On the couch.
- That's how you score now, huh?

593
00:44:15,462 --> 00:44:17,396
I guess.

594
00:44:17,464 --> 00:44:19,523
There's something
I've been wondering.

595
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,692
Whatever happened
to your Uncle Cully?

596
00:44:21,768 --> 00:44:24,134
You think he's gonna
tell you where I am?

597
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:27,037
- Unless you wanna tell me.
- He's dead.

598
00:44:27,106 --> 00:44:29,040
Did 27 years before he got out,

599
00:44:29,108 --> 00:44:32,202
and he died a couple of years afterwards
in a charity hospital...

600
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:35,076
by trying to make up
for all the good times he missed.

601
00:44:35,148 --> 00:44:37,241
That's not gonna be me.

602
00:44:37,317 --> 00:44:41,253
What, one last score, retire
to some island? Is that the idea?

603
00:44:41,321 --> 00:44:43,949
- Jack.
- I'm partial to mountains myself,

604
00:44:44,023 --> 00:44:46,650
but if you like islands,
we'll make it an island.

605
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:50,889
- What do you mean,
"we'll make it an island"?
- You and I can make it...

606
00:44:50,963 --> 00:44:53,431
- Jack, you better come
and check this out.
- Is that Buddy?

607
00:44:53,499 --> 00:44:56,195
- What? No. Okay. Bye-bye.
- Who're you talking to?

608
00:44:56,268 --> 00:44:57,997
[Dial Tone]

609
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,004
- So she's a married woman.
- Right.

610
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,597
But she goes to bed
with a prison escapee because...

611
00:45:02,674 --> 00:45:05,234
he tells her that
he misses his little girl.

612
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:08,302
She tells the world about it.
But you protect her.

613
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,213
You don't reveal her name.

614
00:45:11,283 --> 00:45:13,979
That makes it sound like
what she was doing was okay...

615
00:45:14,052 --> 00:45:16,179
as long as her husband
doesn't find out.

616
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:20,918
Like the guy who cheats
on his wife, saying what
she doesn't know won't bother her.

617
00:45:20,992 --> 00:45:22,926
- Dad.
- What?

618
00:45:23,995 --> 00:45:27,260
[Chuckling]

619
00:45:30,101 --> 00:45:33,229
Ray, I wanna show you
something... in the living room.

620
00:45:34,505 --> 00:45:36,973
- Yeah.
- Good talking to you, Ray.

621
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:38,975
Yeah, you too.

622

[Woman On TV] Federal law enforcement
agents raided a squatters camp...

623
00:45:45,483 --> 00:45:48,145
north of Miami International
Airport this morning...

624
00:45:48,219 --> 00:45:53,486
in the hopes of capturing
a fugitive from Tuesday's daring escape
from Glades prison.

625
00:45:53,558 --> 00:45:57,391
F.B.I. Officials confirm that
one of the escapees, Arelio Linares,

626
00:45:57,460 --> 00:46:00,088
- was killed...
- [Jack] Chino's gonna
wanna talk to me.

627
00:46:00,163 --> 00:46:03,428
- [Continues Indistinct]
- Chino's runnin' for his life.
He don't give a shit about you.

628
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:07,334
He's gonna know by now
I gave him up back at Glades.
He's gonna wanna find me.

629
00:46:07,404 --> 00:46:10,271
Maybe see Adele,
see what she knows.

630
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,070
He knows where she lives?

631
00:46:13,143 --> 00:46:15,805
Jack!

632
00:46:15,879 --> 00:46:17,870
We were talking once,
drinking rum,

633
00:46:17,948 --> 00:46:20,974
and I may have
mentioned Adele.

634
00:46:21,051 --> 00:46:23,542
How she worked for a magician.
Chino got all interested.

635
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,248
He said, "How do you saw
the woman in half?"

636
00:46:26,323 --> 00:46:29,587
Maybe he wanted to meet her,
maybe see her if she came to visit.

637
00:46:29,658 --> 00:46:33,116
Oh, okay, okay. So you call her up
and tell her don't talk to any Cubans.

638
00:46:33,195 --> 00:46:36,392
- The phone's probably tapped by now.
- You're right.

639
00:46:36,465 --> 00:46:38,899
And if the phone is tapped,
you know they have her place staked out.

640
00:46:38,968 --> 00:46:40,993
- Shit!
- [Phone Ringing]

641

Adele Delisi speaking.

642

- [Chino] Uh, uh, this is Adele?
- Yes, it is.

00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:50,478
Oh... Uh, sorry.
Wrong number.

644
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:09,291
Nice disguise.

645
00:47:09,364 --> 00:47:11,298
I'm a tourist.

646
00:47:13,134 --> 00:47:15,898
[Jack]
All right. Here we go.

647
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:20,134
Coming up right here...
on the left.

648

- I wonder what the F.B.I...

is charging to trim hedges
these days?

650

- Quite a checker game
they got goin' on too.
- Pull on up.

651
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:56,104
[Jack]
Oh, man.

Oh, man.

Okay, you saw her.
That's all you get.

- Let's go to Detroit.
- Now you're talkin', brother.

[Adele] I'll say one thing for Jack...
he's very considerate.

00:48:21,434 --> 00:48:23,459
Lights on or off,
if you know what I mean.

- Really.
- Hmm.

00:48:28,474 --> 00:48:30,908
Adele, listen...

I just want to find him
before he does something else
and makes it worse on himself.

00:48:35,781 --> 00:48:39,683
No. [Slurps]
Buddy'll take care of him.

661
00:48:39,752 --> 00:48:43,415
Keep him out of trouble.
He's Jack's conscience, always has been.

662
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:47,219
They must have robbed
50 banks together.

- They were a really great team.
- Until they got busted.

664
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:54,029
Hmm. That wasn't Jack's fault,
no, that was on account of...

665
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:58,729
Buddy, for some reason, decided to call
his sister and confess to the job...

666
00:48:58,803 --> 00:49:01,135
before they'd done it
instead of after.

667
00:49:01,206 --> 00:49:05,836
Well, she called the F.B.I. They both
went down, and they ended up at Lompoc.

668
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:08,936
I think Buddy felt
kind of bad about that.

669
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:13,273
Adele, do you have any idea
where I could find Buddy?

you used to work for?

00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,790

- He gave me your number
and where you live.

You did work for Emile, right?

678
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:41,571
Uh, yeah, I was Emile's box jumper
for four years, almost.

679
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,579
Cono! You were what, his box?

680
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,638
- Uh, his assistant.
- Oh, okay.

681
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:50,151
You say you perform
in the Miami area?

Oh, si. Here, there, you know.

683
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:56,751
I was a magician in Cuba. They used
to call me Manuelito the Magician.

00:49:56,826 --> 00:49:58,919
Mira, can you please open?

685
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:02,795
- I'm not dressed.
- I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.

- You know Jack?
- Who are you?

Jose Chirino.

688

Or maybe you heard Jack call me Chino.
Bueno, I'm the same guy.

689
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:15,903
Tell him he has to wait in the hall.
You have to get dressed. Say it loud.

690
00:50:15,978 --> 00:50:18,208
Wait in the hall.
You have to get dressed.

691
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:21,739
Mira, mira, you tell me
where I could find Jack
and I don't bother you no more.

692
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:24,412
Now, come on, please! Hello?

693
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:28,014
- I don't know where he is.
- I'm the guy that helped
Jack escape from prison.

694
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:31,684
- Mira, please open this fucking door...
- I'm gonna call the police.

695
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,823
Cono, why you gonna do that
to a friend, man? A partner to Jack?

696
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,998
That's it! That's it!

- I'm a federal marshal,
and you're under arrest.

700
00:50:56,685 --> 00:50:59,654
- Get my bag, Adele.
- Oh.

701
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:01,746
Mira, please, please. I think
there's a misunderstanding here.

702
00:51:01,823 --> 00:51:03,791
Can you...
you got nice bag.

703
00:51:03,859 --> 00:51:07,624
Mira, let's say we just forget about it,
okay? We forget about this, I go home...

704
00:51:07,695 --> 00:51:10,721
- Shut up.
- Owwww! Who the hell
taught you how to do that?

705
00:51:10,798 --> 00:51:12,891
- Give me your other hand.
- Okay, okay. Ay, cono.

Ohhhh!
I gotta go make pee-pee.

707
00:51:15,803 --> 00:51:18,567
Ohhhhh! Owww!

00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:21,107
Wow! You are mean!

709
00:51:21,175 --> 00:51:25,578
Look, I'm gonna call my lawyer.
This is... What do they call that?
Human rights violation.

710
00:51:25,646 --> 00:51:28,809
- Ay, cono.
- Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco.

711
00:51:28,883 --> 00:51:31,647
Mira, Adele, Adele.
Can I ask you a question, please?

712
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:34,153
You know that trick you do?

713
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:37,679
Karen? Where are you?
I've been trying to reach you.

714
00:51:37,758 --> 00:51:40,021
When you in the box
and they saw you in half?

715
00:51:40,093 --> 00:51:43,119
- I'm at Adele Delisi's.
- It's magic.

716
00:51:43,196 --> 00:51:45,630
We already talked to her.
That's a dead end.

717
00:51:45,698 --> 00:51:50,362
I was just wondering,
if I brought in Chirino,
would you let me be on the task force?

718
00:51:50,436 --> 00:51:52,836
- Yeah, sure, Karen.
- Then they put the saw through,
and they separate it.

719
00:51:52,906 --> 00:51:56,603
- And that's it. Ta da.
- But how do you twinkle your toes?
I don't get that.

720
00:51:56,676 --> 00:52:00,043
You bring Chirino in,
and you can be on the task force.

721
00:52:00,113 --> 00:52:02,707
- That's all I wanted to know.
- Good.

722
00:52:02,782 --> 00:52:06,013
Now, would you forget
about the ex-wife,

723
00:52:06,085 --> 00:52:08,451
and get over to the Adams Hotel?

724
00:52:08,521 --> 00:52:11,183
- You got it.
- Then they open it up...

725
00:52:11,257 --> 00:52:13,952
- No! No!
- Come on.

726
00:52:14,026 --> 00:52:17,826
- And then that's it.
- Fake legs.

727
00:52:17,896 --> 00:52:21,297
- Mmm.
- Fake legs? How you gonna...

728
00:52:21,366 --> 00:52:23,891
- Ay! Cono.
- Thanks, Adele.

729
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:26,233
How do they twinkle their toes,
then, if it's fake, mira?

730
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:32,103
First thing we do,
we get to Detroit, we find Glenn,

00:52:32,177 --> 00:52:35,271
and we find a window
to throw him out of.

732
00:52:35,347 --> 00:52:37,281
I was thinkin', if I was Glenn,
and I was up there...

733
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:39,340
to take down the Ripper,
where would I go?

734
00:52:39,418 --> 00:52:42,410
'Cept that if you were Glenn,
you wouldn't be thinkin'.

735
00:52:42,487 --> 00:52:44,546
Remember Snoopy Miller,
his old pal from the joint?

736
00:52:44,623 --> 00:52:47,386
Snoop? I figured
he'd be brain-dead by now.

737
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:49,551
Nah, Snoop doesn't box anymore.

738
00:52:49,627 --> 00:52:52,460
Glenn told me that he's managing
some fighters out at the Kronk.

739
00:53:07,678 --> 00:53:10,238
- Did you get the key?
- They're in room 613.

740
00:53:13,017 --> 00:53:16,418
All right. I want
two men outside, front and back.

741
00:53:16,487 --> 00:53:21,186
Conroy, Jamison, go on up to six,
cover both ends of the hall.

742
00:53:22,425 --> 00:53:24,950
You're primary.
You're secondary.

743
00:53:25,028 --> 00:53:27,496
And you're point man.

744
00:53:27,564 --> 00:53:31,261
- You gonna use a ram?
- Yeah. Why?

745
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:33,529
The manager's door is metal.

746
00:53:33,603 --> 00:53:35,628
You know what I mean,
they might all be.

747
00:53:35,705 --> 00:53:39,004
A ram on a metal door makes
a lot of noise for what good it does.

748
00:53:39,075 --> 00:53:41,942
I got a shock lock round
for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.

749
00:53:42,012 --> 00:53:43,946
Fine. Whatever.

750
00:53:54,591 --> 00:53:56,524
Two, please.

751
00:53:58,827 --> 00:54:00,761
You.

752
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:09,065
Fuck it.
Let's take the stairs. Karen...

753
00:54:09,138 --> 00:54:12,301
Take the radio. Stay down here
in the lobby and watch the elevator.

754
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:16,208
- Daniel, I want to go upstairs.
- Well, you can wait
in the car if you want to.

755
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,849
Now, you see Foley and Bragg
coming behind us. What do you do?

756
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:24,852
- Call and tell you?
- And you let them come up.

757
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,412
You don't try to make
the bust yourself. You understand?

758
00:54:34,595 --> 00:54:36,859
Is this your floor, ma'am?

759
00:54:38,099 --> 00:54:40,033
[Shouts]
Is this your floor, ma'am?

760
00:54:40,101 --> 00:54:43,002
Oh. Oh, yes.

761
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,904
Yes, it is. I'm sorry. Thank you.

762
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:52,741
Be advised we are
approaching the door.

763
00:55:00,988 --> 00:55:04,980
Be advised we are
going to blow the door.

764
00:55:10,497 --> 00:55:13,057
[Elevator Dings]

765
00:55:14,768 --> 00:55:16,702
Going up?

766
00:55:31,818 --> 00:55:34,150
Shit, I thought I was going up.

767
00:55:35,789 --> 00:55:38,690
She just looked right at me.

768
00:55:38,758 --> 00:55:41,954
- Who?
- Karen.

769
00:55:42,027 --> 00:55:45,554
- Karen Sisco?
- Yeah.

770
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:47,622
She's in the lobby.

771
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,634
- She's in the lobby?
- Yeah.

772
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:54,769
They know where I live,
no doubt they know what I drive.
We gotta dump this car.

773
00:56:03,616 --> 00:56:05,811
She just sat there,
looking right at me.

774
00:56:05,885 --> 00:56:07,819
[Engine Starts]

775
00:56:10,422 --> 00:56:14,380
[Daniel Over Radio] Karen, they're
not up here. Keep your eyes open.

776
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:19,419
Karen? Karen, are you there?

777
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:21,665
He waved at you?

778
00:56:21,733 --> 00:56:23,667
Couldn't swear to it,
but I'm pretty sure he did.

779
00:56:23,735 --> 00:56:25,828
- Did you wave back?
- I didn't have time.

780
00:56:25,904 --> 00:56:27,895
I imagine you would have, though.

781
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,374
Buddy's sister, Regina Mary Bragg,

782
00:56:31,442 --> 00:56:33,376
got two calls from Buddy
in Detroit this morning.

783
00:56:33,444 --> 00:56:35,912
She calls Burdon.
She's also the one who called Burdon...

784
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,312
- and gave him Buddy's address.
- So?

785
00:56:38,383 --> 00:56:41,648
So what I want to know is why he still
calls her even after she turned him in.

786
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:43,744
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.
What I want to know is why,

787
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:48,655
they got such a big score up north, did
Foley hang around Miami for so long?

788
00:56:48,725 --> 00:56:51,717
- Any thoughts on that?
- None I'd like to share.

789
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:55,491
- I'll call you when I get in.
- Okay.

790
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:05,472

(music) Time is truly wasting (music)

792
00:57:24,594 --> 00:57:29,088
You know, I don't just deal product
and manage fighters no more.

793
00:57:29,165 --> 00:57:33,795
A lot's changed since the last time
you seen me, man. It's like I've, uh,

794
00:57:33,869 --> 00:57:36,633
vertically integrated myself,
you know, diversified and shit,

795
00:57:36,706 --> 00:57:38,697
and now I'm into
the occasional grand larceny,

796
00:57:38,774 --> 00:57:41,072
- home invasion, shit like that.
- Huh.

797
00:57:41,143 --> 00:57:43,338
White Boy Bob right there's
my all-around man, you know.

798
00:57:43,412 --> 00:57:48,440
He's my personal bodyguard when I feel
like I need one, driver, shit like that.

799
00:57:48,517 --> 00:57:51,042
Yo, man, watch the road, White Boy!
What you lookin' back here for?

800
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,216
- [Laughs] Yeah.
- Yeah.

801
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:57,224
- I like this car, Glenn.
- Yeah.

802
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:59,385
You stole a good one, boy.

803
00:57:59,461 --> 00:58:02,521
You can roll around
in Ripley's neighborhood
up there in Bloomfield Hills,

804
00:58:02,597 --> 00:58:04,531
not get sweated
by the private security.

805
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:07,534
Ain't gonna have no police on our ass,
nothing like that. It's nice, man.

806
00:58:08,703 --> 00:58:10,637
Yeah.

807
00:58:10,705 --> 00:58:13,697
Oh, hey, so you still haven't said
how you want to do this thing.

808
00:58:13,775 --> 00:58:18,144
Oh, I'm gonna tell you that
as soon as we get one other
brother I'm gonna need, uh,

809
00:58:18,213 --> 00:58:20,147
Kenneth...
that's Moselle's brother...

810
00:58:20,215 --> 00:58:23,651
along with White Boy right there.

- What?
- All right, here we go, White Boy.

- What's up, brother-in-law?
- What's happenin', hustler?

816
00:58:47,141 --> 00:58:49,632
Hey, man. This cigarette
gonna bother you, Mo?

Yeah, put that thing out, all right?
Ken, this is Glenn.

rip off that rich white dude?

- Yeah, that's him.
- [Laughs] Help you?

821
00:59:04,058 --> 00:59:06,287
Go ahead, White Boy.

Um, whoa, wait a minute, um, look...

letting you in on this gig,

not...

- You just asked
how we gonna do it, right?
- Yeah.

826
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:26,111
Well, I'm telling you how, man.
We the experts.

00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:29,781
Person I'm worried about
is you, Glenn.

828
00:59:29,849 --> 00:59:32,579
- Me?
- Yeah.

829
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:36,383
Can you step up and actually do this
shit instead of just talking the talk?

830
00:59:37,623 --> 00:59:39,818
Do what?

831
00:59:39,892 --> 00:59:42,257
Walk into this house
I got picked out.

832
00:59:42,327 --> 00:59:44,887
Do this cross-dressing nigger
named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to.

- What? When, man?

Shit, right now, son.
What you think all this shit is for?

835
00:59:52,204 --> 00:59:55,264
I don't need to prove
shit to you, man, okay?

836
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:58,605
The Ripley job is my job.
You're either in or you're not.

cool and everything, okay,

but you ain't got
to give me no tone of voice.

you just bounce the fuck out
this whip anywhere up in here.

What do you think?

865
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:25,945
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and
now we got ourselves another partner.

Snoopy Miller,
famous fight thrower.

Seems I read somewhere that you
broke out of a prison down in Florida.

- Is that right?
- They got a low class
of people there, Snoop.

Hey, you call him that again I'm gonna
put your head through the wall.

What? You mean "Snoop"?

880
01:03:11,096 --> 01:03:15,157
Nobody calls me Snoop or Snoopy
anymore is what White Boy Bob
is trying to tell you.

881
01:03:15,234 --> 01:03:17,600
He's just a little crude with it.
You know what I mean?

882
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:19,900
Nah, I left all that
behind me, partner.

883
01:03:19,972 --> 01:03:21,906
But you call this bozo
"White Boy."

884
01:03:21,974 --> 01:03:25,102
White Boy Bob
used to be a fighter.

885
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:28,010
Oh, so tell me, what do you
do now, White Boy Bob,

886
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:30,014
outside of shoot
your big mouth off?

887
01:03:32,985 --> 01:03:35,715
- Like being back in the yard, isn't it?
- Yeah, just like it.

888
01:03:35,788 --> 01:03:37,779
Nobody backing down
or nothing.

889
01:03:37,856 --> 01:03:41,189
- You back down, you just a pussy.
- [Laughs]

890
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:44,888
- Why y'all in Detroit anyway,
up here in the cold?
- Glenn didn't tell you?

891
01:03:44,963 --> 01:03:48,763
- Glenn? What?
- I thought you guys were busted.

892
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:51,859
Why's that? 'Cause you left us
standing on the side of the road?

893
01:03:51,936 --> 01:03:54,063
Whoops.
[Laughs]

894
01:03:56,341 --> 01:03:59,105
Look, Snoop, I don't know
what Glenn promised you,

895
01:03:59,177 --> 01:04:01,839
or what you think you're going
to get out of this... here's the deal:

896
01:04:01,913 --> 01:04:04,882
Buddy and I, we're going to take half
of anything we get off of Ripley.

897
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:06,940
Anything else, you guys are
allowed to cut up any way you want.

898
01:04:07,018 --> 01:04:09,919
Oh. Why don't we talk
about this outside, man?

899
01:04:11,489 --> 01:04:15,721
- Nice in here. It's warm.
- Warm? It's like
90 degrees in here, man.

900
01:04:15,793 --> 01:04:17,987
Sometimes it's 100 up in this mug.

901
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:20,154
That's the way Emmanuel
like to keep it.

902
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:22,596
Keep his fighters mean and lean like
Tommy Hearns. Ain't that right, Kenny?

903
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:24,827
I got someplace to be anyway,
so tell you what:

904
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:26,835
Why don't y'all come by
the fights Friday night?

905
01:04:26,903 --> 01:04:29,394
We'll sit down,
chop it up, you know, look it over.

906
01:04:29,473 --> 01:04:32,601
- State Theater.
- All right. We'll see you then.

907
01:04:42,085 --> 01:04:46,488
So it must take a lot of balls
to walk into a bank and
stick it up with a gun, huh?

908
01:04:46,556 --> 01:04:49,150
I don't know. I never used
a gun before in my life.

909
01:04:49,226 --> 01:04:51,159
You're kidding.

910
01:04:51,227 --> 01:04:54,492
You'd be surprised what all you can get
if you ask for it the right way.

911
01:04:54,563 --> 01:04:58,727
Well, you're the reason, my friend, that
I don't keep all my money in the bank.

912
01:04:58,801 --> 01:05:01,099
So where do you keep
your money, Dick?

913
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:03,104
Talking about all those
uncut diamonds you told about.

914
01:05:03,172 --> 01:05:06,403
- I know what you're talking about.
- You're the one with balls.

915
01:05:06,475 --> 01:05:08,500
Say something like that
to somebody like Glenn?

916
01:05:08,577 --> 01:05:11,341
Glenn? Come on, nobody's
going to believe Glenn.

917
01:05:11,414 --> 01:05:13,882
- Do you believe Glenn?
- Uh, no, I don't.

918
01:05:13,949 --> 01:05:16,941
Besides, even if it was true,
he'd still have to know
where I keep 'em, wouldn't he?

919
01:05:17,019 --> 01:05:19,817
Doesn't have to know anything.
You told him you keep 'em in your house.

920
01:05:19,889 --> 01:05:23,689
It's a very big house.
So, how much longer you in here for?

921
01:05:23,759 --> 01:05:28,559
Uh, 22 months,
three days, two hours.

922
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:32,498
- Why?
- 'Cause I could use a guy like you.

923
01:05:32,567 --> 01:05:35,730
Somebody that knows how to ask
for things in the right way.

924
01:05:35,804 --> 01:05:37,738
I'm talking about
when you're out of here.

925
01:05:37,806 --> 01:05:40,240
After all, you can't rob banks
forever, can you?

926
01:05:40,308 --> 01:05:43,300
- I'm not exactly a nine to five type.
- Who is?

927
01:05:53,455 --> 01:05:55,389
I thought everybody liked Eddie.

928
01:05:57,092 --> 01:06:01,391
- How you doin', Ray?
- I'm freezing.

929
01:06:01,462 --> 01:06:03,896
But I'm getting warmer.

930
01:06:03,964 --> 01:06:08,162
So listen, other than we had so much fun
the last time we worked together,

931
01:06:08,235 --> 01:06:10,635
you want to tell me why you're coming
to me instead of the F.B.I.?

932
01:06:10,704 --> 01:06:13,537
I go to the F.B.I.,
the first thing they're
gonna do is send me to get some coffee.

933
01:06:13,607 --> 01:06:15,541
You know what?
You're right.

934
01:06:15,609 --> 01:06:19,067
Ray, about a year ago,
D.E.A. Had a guy, Glenn Michaels,
on possession with intent.

935
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:22,547
- Listen, is that your car?
Find out whose it is.
- They couldn't make it stick.

936
01:06:22,616 --> 01:06:25,608
In his statement, he said he was coming
to Detroit to see a friend...

937
01:06:25,686 --> 01:06:27,677
about job opportunities,
if you can believe that.

938
01:06:27,755 --> 01:06:29,848
- What was the name of the friend?
- Maurice Miller,

939
01:06:29,923 --> 01:06:32,915
also known as Snoopy,
used to be a prizefighter.

940
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:35,586
I know Snoopy.
He's a fucking wack job.

941
01:06:35,661 --> 01:06:37,993
He thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard,
hangs out over on the west side...

942
01:06:38,064 --> 01:06:40,862
with a couple of other
first-rate nut cases.

943
01:06:40,933 --> 01:06:43,197
- Well, I'm gonna need
a last known address.
- 2710 coming in.

944
01:06:43,269 --> 01:06:45,897
- You're gonna need what?
- A last known address.

945
01:06:46,973 --> 01:06:49,771
That your car?

946
01:06:49,842 --> 01:06:52,834
No way. I don't want you
talking to Miller alone.

947
01:06:52,912 --> 01:06:57,110
Come on, Ray. I'm a federal officer.
I can handle myself. I'm armed.

948
01:06:59,452 --> 01:07:01,545
[Sighs] I'll call you tomorrow
with the address.

949
01:07:03,956 --> 01:07:05,890
Thank you, Raymond.

950
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:08,357
[Buddy]
You see the paper?

951
01:07:08,426 --> 01:07:10,724
- [Jack] It's a terrific shot of her.
- [Buddy] Outside of that.

952
01:07:10,796 --> 01:07:14,232
Doesn't say what she's doing here,
but I don't think it has
anything to do with us.

953
01:07:14,299 --> 01:07:16,824
She came up here on her vacation
because she likes shitty weather.

954
01:07:16,902 --> 01:07:18,836
Nah, I think she's after Glenn.

955
01:07:18,904 --> 01:07:20,997
The girl still there?

956
01:07:21,072 --> 01:07:24,235
They don't stay the whole night, Jack,
unless you pay for it.

957
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:28,973
- Did you tell your sister?
- Yeah, I just hung up.
She prayed for me.

958
01:07:29,047 --> 01:07:32,414
- Mm-hmm. And how long were you
on the phone with her?
- Two hours.

959
01:07:32,484 --> 01:07:36,250
- And how long were you with the girl?
- 45 minutes.

960
01:07:36,321 --> 01:07:38,255
You didn't tell your sister
about Ripley, did you?

961
01:07:38,323 --> 01:07:40,723
Look, Jack, just forget
about my sister, okay?

962
01:07:40,792 --> 01:07:43,692
Now, if Karen Sisco is
tailing Glenn, we're fucked.

963
01:07:43,761 --> 01:07:45,820
Tomorrow night at the fights,
we all get picked up.

964
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:49,457
Why don't we just drive by where
we're meeting tonight, check it out.

965
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:51,467
And we'll go by Ripley's too,
while we're at it.

966
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:53,867
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

967
01:08:02,413 --> 01:08:06,110
- Athenaeum Hotel, how may I help you?
- Karen Sisco, please.

968
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:09,515
- Hello, Best Western.
- Karen Sisco, please.

969
01:08:13,724 --> 01:08:17,124
- Moselle Miller?
- What do you want?

970
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:21,289
- I'm looking for Maurice.
- You find him, tell him
the dog got run over.

971
01:08:21,364 --> 01:08:23,332
I'm out of grocery money.

972
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:26,664
- Moselle, who you talkin' to?
- Lady lookin' for Maurice.

973
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:28,795
- What does she want?
- Hasn't said.

974
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:32,330
- That's not Maurice?
- That's Kenneth, my brother.
He's talkin' on the phone.

975
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:35,138
- Ask her what she want with him!
- You ask her!

976
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:38,237
- Maurice business
is none of my business.
- Yeah, you damn right.

977
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:42,178
State Theater, huh?
Who's fightin'?

978
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:46,183
Nigger, what?
[Laughs]

979
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,520
I'm looking for somebody
I think Maurice knows.

980
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,490
You're not with probation,
one of those?

981
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:58,795
- No.
- You a lawyer?

982
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:01,995
No, I'm not. I'm looking
for somebody named Glenn Michaels.

983
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:06,937
Glenn? I don't know any Glenn.

984
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:09,000
He said he stayed here
last November.

985
01:09:09,077 --> 01:09:11,841
- Here in this house?
- He said he stayed with Maurice.

986
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:15,475
Well, he ain't
even here that much.

987
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:17,415
I'd like to know where he goes,
but at the same time,

988
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:20,353
I don't wanna know,
you understand?

989
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:23,357
Yeah.

990
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:27,087
- You say your dog was killed?
- Got run over by a car.

991
01:09:28,362 --> 01:09:32,355
- What'd you call him?
- Was a she. Named Tuffy.

992
01:09:34,669 --> 01:09:37,365
Where do you think
I might find Maurice, Moselle?

993
01:09:37,438 --> 01:09:40,339
I don't know.
The gym, the fights.

994
01:09:40,408 --> 01:09:44,504
I know he don't miss the fights.
They're havin' some tomorrow
down at the State Theater.

995
01:09:44,578 --> 01:09:46,910
- He used to take me.
- The State Theater.

996
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:49,245
Why you askin'
all these questions about Maurice?

997
01:09:49,317 --> 01:09:51,308
She lookin' for a man name of Glenn.

998
01:09:51,385 --> 01:09:54,548
Did I ask you? Go on and do something
with yourself, Moselle.

999
01:09:54,622 --> 01:09:58,581
Why don't you take your ass
to Dot and Etta's and get us
some shrimp or somethin'?

1000
01:10:08,335 --> 01:10:10,826
- You're a fighter.
- How you know that?

1001
01:10:10,904 --> 01:10:14,032
- I can tell.
- Yeah, I was.

1002
01:10:15,642 --> 01:10:18,076
'Til I got my retina
detached two times.

1003
01:10:19,746 --> 01:10:23,682
- What'd you fight, about middleweight?
- Nah, light.

1004
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:26,776
Super middleweight,
once my body developed.

1005
01:10:28,121 --> 01:10:31,818
- What you go about, what, a bantam?
- Flyweight.

1006
01:10:31,891 --> 01:10:36,384
[Laughs] Nigger, what?
You know your divisions, huh?

1007
01:10:36,462 --> 01:10:39,761
Do you like the fights?
You like the rough stuff?

1008
01:10:39,832 --> 01:10:42,630
Yeah, I bet you do.

1009
01:10:42,701 --> 01:10:45,101
You like to get down
and tussle a little bit?

1010
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:48,435
Like me and Tuffy,
before she got run over.

1011
01:10:48,507 --> 01:10:50,805
We used to get down on the floor
and tussle all the time.

1012
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:56,712
I'd say to her, "You a good bitch,
Tuffy. Here's a treat for ya."

1013
01:10:56,782 --> 01:11:01,446
And I give Tuffy what all good bitches
love best, and you know what that is?

1014
01:11:02,588 --> 01:11:07,116
Know what that is? A bone.

1015
01:11:07,192 --> 01:11:09,421
I'll give you
a good bone too, girl.

1016
01:11:09,494 --> 01:11:11,462
- You're not my type.
- [Laughs]

1017
01:11:11,529 --> 01:11:14,191
No, that shit
don't mean nothin' to me.

1018
01:11:14,265 --> 01:11:17,894
- I let the monster out,
you gonna do what it wants.
- I gotta go, Kenneth.

1019
01:11:17,969 --> 01:11:20,301
- Maybe we'll see each other again.
- No, no, we gonna tussle first.

1020
01:11:21,706 --> 01:11:23,867
Awww!
[Grunts]

1021
01:11:23,941 --> 01:11:26,808
Damn it!
What the fuck was that?

1022
01:11:26,878 --> 01:11:30,541
You wanted to tussle.
We tussled.

1023
01:11:31,749 --> 01:11:35,810
[Sips]
That's a big ass house.

1024
01:11:35,887 --> 01:11:37,821
Place almost looks
like a prison.

1025
01:11:37,889 --> 01:11:40,187
No doubt he's got some
serious security system.

1026
01:11:40,258 --> 01:11:43,352
Time comes, we go up, knock on the door,
see if he wants to talk about old times.

1027
01:11:43,428 --> 01:11:46,157
- You know, the easy way.
- Cool.

1028
01:11:46,229 --> 01:11:49,995
Think he'll let us in, we got the Snoop
and that musclebound asshole with us?

1029
01:11:50,067 --> 01:11:52,001
Nobody's gonna be with us.

1030
01:11:52,069 --> 01:11:54,765
I say we go to the fights tomorrow
night, see what Snoopy's big plan is,

1031
01:11:54,838 --> 01:11:58,239
then we go in,
ahead of him, alone.

1032
01:11:58,308 --> 01:12:00,242
Oh, I can dig it.

1033
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:03,040
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop,
while we off livin' the good life.

1034
01:12:03,113 --> 01:12:05,604
Good life. Buddy, you know anybody
who's done one last big score...

1035
01:12:05,682 --> 01:12:07,616
and then gone on
to live the good life?

1036
01:12:07,684 --> 01:12:10,812
Look, Jack, there's a chance
we'll walk out of here with nothin'.

1037
01:12:10,887 --> 01:12:12,878
I say,
let fate decide.

1038
01:12:12,956 --> 01:12:15,789
Let fate decide? What are you,
the fuckin' Dalai Lama now?

1039
01:12:15,859 --> 01:12:17,793
Nah, man,
it's my sister.

1040
01:12:17,861 --> 01:12:20,055
My sister believes
in fate but not hell.

1041
01:12:20,129 --> 01:12:22,188
That's why she stopped praying
for all the lost souls,

1042
01:12:22,264 --> 01:12:24,425
since you don't hear that much
about purgatory anymore.

1043
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,867
But every day, she asks her boss
to pray that Buddy don't fuck up.

1044
01:12:27,937 --> 01:12:30,531
- [Chuckles]
- I mean, what do you think?

1045
01:12:30,606 --> 01:12:33,074
- Well...
- You think there's a hell?

1046
01:12:33,142 --> 01:12:36,009
Yeah, it's called
the Glades Correctional Institute.

1047
01:12:36,078 --> 01:12:38,478
I'm sure as shit not going back there
or any place like it.

1048
01:12:38,547 --> 01:12:40,879
They put a gun on you,
you'll go, brother.

1049
01:12:42,585 --> 01:12:45,577
They put a gun on you,
you still have a choice.

1050
01:12:47,957 --> 01:12:51,950
So, Mr. Foley,

1051
01:12:52,027 --> 01:12:56,588
Mr. Ripley and I have
had a long discussion
about your role in the company,

1052
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:59,258
and it was his feeling you'd be
happiest working down here in Miami.

1053
01:12:59,334 --> 01:13:01,928
- How's that sound to you?
- Sounds great.

1054
01:13:02,003 --> 01:13:05,268
Good. You're about
a 42 long, right?

1055
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:11,475
I uh, I'm about a 42...

1056
01:13:11,546 --> 01:13:13,480
like, 42 regular.

1057
01:13:21,489 --> 01:13:23,684
- Okay, let's see how she fits.
- What is that?

1058
01:13:23,758 --> 01:13:25,692
Your uniform.

1059
01:13:27,895 --> 01:13:29,829
My uniform.

1060
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:33,189
Mr. Foley. Mr. Foley!

1061
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:36,529
Sir, sir. Excuse me, sir.

1062
01:13:36,603 --> 01:13:38,969
Sir! Sir, excuse me!

1063
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:41,098
- You can't go in there!
- Are you fucking kidding me?
A security guard?

1064
01:13:41,175 --> 01:13:43,769
- What are you, stoned?
- Hey, hey! Take it easy!

1065
01:13:43,844 --> 01:13:45,778
It's all right, Peggy.
It's under control.

1066
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,445
[Sighs]
You know something?

1067
01:13:50,517 --> 01:13:53,486
I wasn't sure that you'd show up here,
but I was very sure if you did,

1068
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:56,182
you'd throw this job
in my face.

1069
01:13:56,256 --> 01:13:58,190
Let me tell you
something.

1070
01:13:58,258 --> 01:14:01,715
Every single thing you've done
with your life up until this point...

1071
01:14:01,794 --> 01:14:04,228
in the real world
means nothing.

1072
01:14:04,297 --> 01:14:06,231
Less than nothing.

1073
01:14:06,299 --> 01:14:08,358
You're a bank robber.

1074
01:14:08,434 --> 01:14:11,164
That's not
a very marketable skill.

1075
01:14:11,237 --> 01:14:13,967
We don't see a lot
of old bank robbers walking around...

1076
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,975
with a pension plan,
now do we?

1077
01:14:17,043 --> 01:14:19,011
I think you know this.
That's why you're here.

1078
01:14:19,078 --> 01:14:21,808
[Sighs]
Today, I've offered you...

1079
01:14:21,881 --> 01:14:25,146
a lousy job with a lousy wage.

1080
01:14:25,218 --> 01:14:29,314
You want something better?
Why don't you show me you can change?

1081
01:14:29,388 --> 01:14:32,585
Then I'll offer you
something better, a lot better.

1082
01:14:32,658 --> 01:14:36,149
But until then, my friend,
you'll have to earn it.

1083
01:14:37,562 --> 01:14:39,496
How, Dick?
The way you earn it?

1084
01:14:40,632 --> 01:14:42,657
Married some rich broad
owns the company,

1085
01:14:42,734 --> 01:14:44,759
selling it off a piece at a time
then divorcing her?

1086
01:14:44,836 --> 01:14:49,239
What's this Knute Rockne "pull yourself
up by the bootstraps" bullshit?

1087
01:14:49,307 --> 01:14:52,504
Back in prison, a guy like you
in a place like that?

1088
01:14:52,577 --> 01:14:55,876
You were ice cream for freaks.
A goddamned dumpling.

1089
01:14:55,947 --> 01:14:59,439
Maurice and a dozen other guys would
have bled you till you had nothing.

1090
01:14:59,517 --> 01:15:02,680
Until you were nothing.
I saved your ass!

1091
01:15:02,754 --> 01:15:05,245
So you'll pardon me if I don't want
to sit on a fucking stool all day,

1092
01:15:05,323 --> 01:15:08,520
and say, "Sign in here, please,"
or "Hey, pal, you can't park here."

1093
01:15:08,593 --> 01:15:11,755
All right, Dick?
I can't fuckin' do it, Dick!

1094
01:15:11,829 --> 01:15:13,797
- I'm disappointed in you.
- You wanna...

1095
01:15:13,864 --> 01:15:16,424
Oh, here we go.
What job did he promise you boys?

1096
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,060
- There's two ways we can do this.
- Yeah, what are they?

1097
01:16:03,646 --> 01:16:07,776
Hey, Buddy, I gotta get a better pair
of shoes and some things for tomorrow.

1098
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:09,784
Drop me off by the Ren Center
and we'll hook up later?

1099
01:16:09,852 --> 01:16:12,719
Yeah, okay.

1100
01:16:12,789 --> 01:16:14,450
I better go call my sister.

1101

(music) [Soft Jazz Piano]

1102
01:16:30,172 --> 01:16:32,766
[Woman]
Can I get you anything?

1103
01:16:32,841 --> 01:16:35,207
Yeah, I'll have a bourbon, please.
Water back.

1104
01:16:35,277 --> 01:16:37,211
Okay.

1105
01:16:39,648 --> 01:16:42,776
Hey, Tad, why don't
you do us again, please?

1106
01:16:42,851 --> 01:16:46,048
Oh, and, Celeste,
put the lady's drink on our bill.

1107
01:16:47,656 --> 01:16:49,817
[Soft Chattering]

1108
01:16:57,298 --> 01:17:00,529
- They want to buy your drink for you.
- Yeah, I get that.

1109
01:17:00,601 --> 01:17:02,967
- Tell them I'd rather pay for my own.
- Okay.

1110
01:17:07,742 --> 01:17:09,676
I'll find out.

1111
01:17:13,314 --> 01:17:15,305
Excuse me.

1112
01:17:15,383 --> 01:17:17,851
My associates and I,
we made a little bet...

1113
01:17:17,918 --> 01:17:19,886
on what you do
for a living.

1114
01:17:19,954 --> 01:17:22,923
And I won.
Hi, I'm Phillip.

1115
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:26,687
If it's okay with you,
Phillip, I'd rather just
have a quiet drink and leave.

1116
01:17:26,761 --> 01:17:30,662
Don't you want to know what I guessed?
How I know what you do for a living?

1117
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:33,858
Really, Phillip, I don't want to be
rude. I just want to be left alone.

1118
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,874
[Chuckles]
It's a little cold over there.

[Clears Throat]

1120
01:17:49,382 --> 01:17:51,873
Excuse me.
I think I know why you're depressed.

1121
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:55,182
If I can offer
my observation.

1122
01:17:56,356 --> 01:17:59,519
See, I got a hunch
you're the new sales rep,

1123
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:04,790
and the client's not exactly knocked out
by the fact that a young lady...

1124
01:18:04,863 --> 01:18:09,129
even one as stunning as yourself...
is handling the account.

1125
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:12,102
Am I close?

We're all ad guys. Flew in this morning
from the apple... New York.

Came in to pitch
Hiram Walker Distillery.

1129
01:18:24,383 --> 01:18:27,409
Little test market campaign
for the new margarita mix.

1130
01:18:27,486 --> 01:18:31,616
It's really pretty interesting.
We take this, um,

1131
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:34,250
Mex... um,
Hispanic bandito...

1132

with his bullet belts and everything,
and the big Chihuahua hat,

1133
01:18:37,962 --> 01:18:40,760
and he pulls out
his six-guns,

1134
01:18:40,832 --> 01:18:44,359
- and these guys back here...
- Andy.

Really.
Who gives a shit?

- Do you want to tell me what happened?
- Beat it, Andy.

01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,285
Andy.

What'd you do?
[Laughs]

1139
01:19:16,233 --> 01:19:20,329
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Yeah, I'd love one.

1140
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:24,805
Sit down.

I'm Celeste.

- It takes forever to get a drink.
There's only one waitress.
- I can go to the bar.

1144
01:19:48,264 --> 01:19:50,630
- Oh, don't go.
- Are those guys bothering you?

1145
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:52,667
No, they're fine.
I mean, you just got here.

1146
01:19:57,139 --> 01:19:59,073
Here, help yourself.

1147
01:20:00,976 --> 01:20:03,501
- You like bourbon?
- I love it.

1148
01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:07,015
We got that out of the way. Tell me,
Celeste, what do you do for a living?

1149
01:20:07,082 --> 01:20:10,677
I'm a sales rep,
and I came here to call on a customer,

1150
01:20:10,753 --> 01:20:12,880
but they gave me a hard time
'cause I'm a girl.

1151
01:20:12,955 --> 01:20:14,889
Is that how
you think of yourself?

1152
01:20:14,957 --> 01:20:16,891
- As a sales rep?
- As a girl.

1153
01:20:16,959 --> 01:20:18,950
- Yeah, I don't have a problem with it.
- I like your hair.

1154
01:20:19,028 --> 01:20:22,986
- I like your outfit.
- Actually, this is
my second favorite outfit.

1155
01:20:23,064 --> 01:20:26,397
I had a first favorite, but it got
ruined and I had to get rid of it.

1156
01:20:26,467 --> 01:20:28,401
- You did?
- It smelled.

1157
01:20:28,469 --> 01:20:30,994
- Really? Having it
cleaned didn't help?
- No.

1158
01:20:31,072 --> 01:20:33,006
So tell me, Gary,
what do you do for a living?

1159
01:20:33,074 --> 01:20:36,066
- How far do you want
to go with this?
- Don't say anything yet.

1160
01:20:36,144 --> 01:20:38,544
I don't think it works
if we're somebody else.

1161
01:20:38,613 --> 01:20:40,547
I mean, Gary and Celeste,
what do they know about anything?

1162
01:20:40,615 --> 01:20:43,175
- Well, this is your game,
I've never played before.
- It's not a game.

1163
01:20:43,251 --> 01:20:45,412
It's not something you play.

1164
01:20:45,486 --> 01:20:47,477
Well, does this make
any sense to you?

1165
01:20:47,555 --> 01:20:49,887
It doesn't have to.
It's something that happens.

1166
01:20:49,958 --> 01:20:55,020
It's like seeing
someone for the first time...
like you could be passing on the street,

1167
01:20:55,095 --> 01:20:58,360
and you look at each other
and for a few seconds...

1168
01:20:58,432 --> 01:21:01,868
there's this kind of a recognition...
like you both know something.

1169
01:21:01,935 --> 01:21:04,802
The next moment,
the person's gone,

1170
01:21:04,871 --> 01:21:08,272
and it's too late
to do anything about it.

1171
01:21:08,342 --> 01:21:11,175
And you always remember it,
because it was there, and you let it go,

1172
01:21:11,244 --> 01:21:14,611
and you think to yourself,
"What if I had stopped?
If I had said something?"

1173
01:21:14,681 --> 01:21:16,615
"What if?"

1174
01:21:16,683 --> 01:21:18,651
"What if?"

1175
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:22,780
And it may only happen
a few times in your life.

1176
01:21:25,025 --> 01:21:28,426
- Or once.
- Or once.

1177
01:22:04,562 --> 01:22:07,122
[Karen]
How'd you find me?

1178
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:09,132
Uh...

1179
01:22:10,902 --> 01:22:13,200
Called your room
from downstairs.

1180
01:22:13,271 --> 01:22:15,705
Oh.
[Laughs]

1181
01:22:17,042 --> 01:22:19,033
And if I had answered,
what were you gonna say?

1182
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:23,479
I would say who I was,
and do you remember me,
and want to meet for a drink?

1183
01:22:23,548 --> 01:22:28,485
If I remembered you.
I came here looking for you.

1184
01:22:28,553 --> 01:22:31,317
All right, so then I would have
said yes, but for all you know,

1185
01:22:31,389 --> 01:22:33,823
I could have had a SWAT team waiting
for you... why would you trust me?

1186
01:22:33,892 --> 01:22:35,883
It'd be worth the risk.

1187
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,484
- You like taking risks.
- So do you.

1188
01:22:40,798 --> 01:22:43,130
[Karen]
You know, sooner or later...

1189
01:22:46,704 --> 01:22:50,037
You really wear that suit.

1190
01:22:50,107 --> 01:22:52,667
Well, that's not
what you were about to say.

1191
01:22:52,743 --> 01:22:55,644
- Remember how talkative
you were in the trunk?
- Mm-hmm.

1192
01:22:55,713 --> 01:22:58,580
- Adele said you do that
when you're nervous.
- Oh, she did, did she?

1193
01:23:00,117 --> 01:23:04,213
- You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
- But in a nice way.

1194
01:23:23,506 --> 01:23:26,532
You know, that Sig
you took from me was special.

1195
01:23:26,609 --> 01:23:28,577
My dad gave it to me
for my birthday.

1196
01:23:28,644 --> 01:23:30,544
Yeah?

1197
01:23:30,613 --> 01:23:32,706
What were you going
to do with me?

1198
01:23:32,782 --> 01:23:35,307
I hadn't really worked
that part out yet.

1199
01:23:35,384 --> 01:23:37,579
All I knew is that I liked you,
and that I didn't wanna...

1200
01:23:37,653 --> 01:23:39,848
leave you there on the side of the road
and never see you again.

1201
01:23:41,491 --> 01:23:43,459
Then you waved to me
in that elevator.

1202
01:23:43,526 --> 01:23:46,427
- Yeah, I wasn't sure if you caught that.
- [Laughs]

1203
01:23:46,496 --> 01:23:49,521
I couldn't believe it.
By that time I had been...

1204
01:23:49,598 --> 01:23:51,828
thinking about you a lot...

1205
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:55,358
and just wondering
what it would be like if we met,

1206
01:23:55,437 --> 01:23:58,463
if we could take a time-out.

1207
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:00,906
I was thinking the same thing.

1208
01:24:00,976 --> 01:24:03,843
I kept thinking,
"What if we took a time-out?"

1209
01:24:03,912 --> 01:24:07,780
If we... just spent
some time together.

1210
01:24:12,621 --> 01:24:14,555
- You know, I saw you on the street.
- Where?

1211
01:24:14,623 --> 01:24:17,114
Outside Adele's.

1212
01:24:17,192 --> 01:24:20,059
- You went to see her?
- To warn her about Chino.

1213
01:24:20,128 --> 01:24:23,358
- So she did help you.
- I don't think we should get into that.

1214
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:25,489
You're right.
And I won't ask about Buddy,

1215
01:24:25,566 --> 01:24:31,095
or what you guys are doing
in Detroit, or if you've run
into Glenn Michaels yet...

1216
01:24:31,172 --> 01:24:34,005
Okay, now, don't talk like that,
because you scare me.

1217
01:24:45,686 --> 01:24:48,655
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

1218
01:25:43,008 --> 01:25:45,636
There's something
I want you to know.

1219
01:25:45,711 --> 01:25:47,975
I wasn't just looking for a fuck,
if that's what you're thinking.

1220
01:25:48,046 --> 01:25:50,674
- Or, I was...
- Why are you mad?

1221
01:25:50,749 --> 01:25:54,344
I was looking for some kinky thrill...
you know, score with the bank robber.

1222
01:25:54,419 --> 01:25:57,183
- The way some women go for rough trade...
- All right.

1223
01:25:57,256 --> 01:26:01,249
Now I can say that I fucked
a U.S. Marshal. Do you think I will?

1224
01:26:01,326 --> 01:26:03,556
I don't know.

1225
01:26:03,629 --> 01:26:05,562
Mm-hmm.

1226
01:26:07,164 --> 01:26:09,098
Come here.

1227
01:26:21,479 --> 01:26:23,947
I know a guy...

1228
01:26:24,015 --> 01:26:27,109
walks into a bank with a bottle,
tells everybody it's nitroglycerine.

1229
01:26:27,184 --> 01:26:29,778
He scores some cash
off of the teller.

1230
01:26:29,854 --> 01:26:33,153
On his way out, he drops the bottle.
It cracks on the floor.

1231
01:26:33,224 --> 01:26:36,853
He slips in it. He smacks up
his head. They get him.

1232
01:26:36,928 --> 01:26:40,624
The nitroglycerine
was canola oil.

1233
01:26:40,697 --> 01:26:44,428
I know more fucked-up bank robbers
than ones that know what they're doing.

1234
01:26:44,501 --> 01:26:48,665
I doubt one in ten could tell you
where the dye pack is.

1235
01:26:48,738 --> 01:26:51,263
Most bank robbers
are fucking morons.

1236
01:26:51,341 --> 01:26:55,778
For you to go to bed with one
for kinky thrills,

1237
01:26:55,845 --> 01:26:59,178
like you were saying,
makes you as dumb as they are.

1238
01:26:59,249 --> 01:27:01,183
Now, you are not dumb.

1239
01:27:03,053 --> 01:27:07,752
Why would you think that? Why would
you think that I would think that?

1240
01:27:10,961 --> 01:27:12,929
You're not dumb.

1241
01:27:14,763 --> 01:27:16,924
Well, I don't know about that.
[Laughs]

1242
01:27:16,999 --> 01:27:20,093
I mean, you can't do three falls
and think you have much of a brain.

1243
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,504
Come here.

1244
01:27:41,156 --> 01:27:43,351
You're getting
serious on me now.

1245
01:27:46,395 --> 01:27:48,589
Tryin' not to.

1246
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:54,066
I just want to know
what's gonna happen.

1247
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,143
You know.

1248
01:28:52,993 --> 01:28:55,325
Put it together now. Put it together!
Upstairs and downstairs.

1249
01:28:55,395 --> 01:28:58,363
- He don't want
to see you downstairs!
- Man, you drink like a bitch!

1250
01:29:00,132 --> 01:29:02,692
He don't want to see you... Get your
tussle on. Joe, get your tussle on!

1251
01:29:02,768 --> 01:29:05,100
Yeah, don't let him
out that corner.

1252
01:29:05,171 --> 01:29:07,366
Don't let him out, now.

1253
01:29:09,975 --> 01:29:13,433
Hey, you know what?
I gotta go take a pee.

1254
01:29:13,512 --> 01:29:17,414
What are you tellin' us for?
You want somebody to hold your pecker?

1255
01:29:18,651 --> 01:29:20,846
Do that work, Joe!

1256
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,854
Put it together now, Joe!

1257
01:29:22,922 --> 01:29:25,447
That's it, baby!

1258
01:29:25,524 --> 01:29:29,187
Take him deep!
Oh, oh, my God, I love it.

1259
01:29:29,261 --> 01:29:31,421
Put him to sleep, Joe!
Put him to sleep, Joe!

1260
01:29:31,496 --> 01:29:34,363
Sit down, Kenny.
That's it! That's it!

1261
01:30:12,336 --> 01:30:14,998
- You tryin' to steal this car, Glenn?
- Don't, don't, don't!

1262
01:30:16,707 --> 01:30:18,641
Oh, my God,
I can't believe this!

1263
01:30:18,709 --> 01:30:22,941
Another one of those days, huh?
Nothing seems to be going right.

1264
01:30:23,013 --> 01:30:25,004
- I don't have the keys to the car.
- I see that.

1265
01:30:25,082 --> 01:30:27,949
No, I mean I am not
fucking stealing the car!

1266
01:30:28,018 --> 01:30:32,011
- You're not?
- No, I already stole it a week ago,

1267
01:30:32,089 --> 01:30:34,523
whenever it was,
in West Palm.

1268
01:30:34,591 --> 01:30:36,582
So I can't be
stealing it again, can I?

1269
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:39,356
- Put your hands on the wheel, please.
- Okay, so now you're gonna...

1270
01:30:39,429 --> 01:30:41,794
bust me for pickin' up
a car, what the...

1271
01:30:41,864 --> 01:30:44,355
For the car, for aiding
and abetting a prison escape,

1272
01:30:44,433 --> 01:30:47,596
and for conspiring to do
whatever you came here for.

1273
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:50,639
Listen to me. These guys, they're gonna
be out here any minute looking for me,

1274
01:30:50,706 --> 01:30:54,005
and they're
fucking animals, man.

1275
01:30:56,245 --> 01:30:58,406
What's going on, Glenn?

1276
01:30:58,481 --> 01:31:01,143
Nothing. I just wanna
get the fuck outta here.

1277
01:31:01,217 --> 01:31:03,617
I thought this whole thing
was your idea.

1278
01:31:03,686 --> 01:31:05,779
Okay, ripping off Ripley
was my idea,

1279
01:31:05,855 --> 01:31:09,586
but these guys, they are
in a whole other level of their own.

1280
01:31:09,659 --> 01:31:12,719
- Ripley, the Wall Street guy?
- Yeah, the plan was...

1281
01:31:12,795 --> 01:31:14,762
to pick him up
at his office tomorrow...

1282
01:31:14,829 --> 01:31:17,730
and drive him out
to his house in Bloomfield Hills.

1283
01:31:17,799 --> 01:31:21,257
And now I don't give a shit
what the guys do, you know?

1284
01:31:21,336 --> 01:31:24,828
- And Foley was part of this.
- Yeah, he's supposed to be,
but he hasn't showed up yet,

1285
01:31:24,906 --> 01:31:27,067
- which is good for him.
- Why?

1286
01:31:27,142 --> 01:31:30,873
Because Maurice is
gonna kill him.

1287
01:31:30,946 --> 01:31:33,881
Like, try to collect
the reward money or something.

1288
01:31:33,949 --> 01:31:36,918
But you say he hasn't shown up yet.
You think he backed out?

1289
01:31:36,985 --> 01:31:39,954
I don't know.
He doesn't exactly confide in me.

1290
01:31:41,022 --> 01:31:43,115
I wonder why.

1291
01:31:43,191 --> 01:31:46,718
Okay, if you're gonna do this,
let's do it and get out of here.

1292
01:31:46,795 --> 01:31:49,228
I am freezing
my ass off!

1293
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:51,787
If you wanna get out of here, run.
It'll warm you up.

1294
01:31:51,865 --> 01:31:53,799
Oh, ha, ha.

1295
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:01,735
Really?

1296
01:32:01,809 --> 01:32:05,267
I swear to God, Glenn, if I find out
that you are lying to me, l...

1297
01:32:05,346 --> 01:32:07,337
I know, you will find me.
I believe it.

1298
01:32:12,987 --> 01:32:16,150
Hey, know what
I was thinkin'?

1299
01:32:16,223 --> 01:32:19,192
If you didn't drive me
to the federal court last summer,

1300
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:21,194
you wouldn't even
know who I am.

1301
01:32:21,262 --> 01:32:26,358
If I didn't know you, Glenn,
by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.

1302
01:32:26,432 --> 01:32:28,992
Think of it that way.
Now run.

1303
01:32:36,843 --> 01:32:38,777
Yeah! Yeah!

1304
01:32:41,381 --> 01:32:44,509
I'm tellin' you,
man, the money is here.

1305
01:32:44,584 --> 01:32:47,815
- Snoop.
- Hey, it's the bank robbers.

1306
01:32:47,887 --> 01:32:49,855
Y'all missin' the fights, man.
Pull up a chair.

1307
01:32:49,922 --> 01:32:52,390
- Who's sittin' here?
- Oh, that's your homey, Glenn, man.

1308
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:54,392
But he bounced to the bathroom
a couple minutes ago...

1309
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:56,519
- and we ain't seen him since.
- Must've fell in, man.

1310
01:32:56,596 --> 01:32:58,563
No doubt.

1311
01:32:58,630 --> 01:33:01,121
Yeah, sent these two looking for him.
They came back shaking their heads.

1312
01:33:02,634 --> 01:33:05,228
Well, if he left his coat
and he's been gone a while, then...

1313
01:33:05,304 --> 01:33:07,397
- Car's here, man. I checked.
- Yeah.

1314
01:33:07,472 --> 01:33:10,737
- All right. We're leavin'.
- Leavin'?

1315
01:33:10,809 --> 01:33:12,800
- What the fuck, Foley?
- Stupid, you know where Glenn is.

1316
01:33:12,878 --> 01:33:16,006
- Look, what you worried
about Glenn for, what he know?
- I thought everything.

1317
01:33:16,081 --> 01:33:19,209
No, Glenn know everything
that's supposed to happen tomorrow.

1318
01:33:19,284 --> 01:33:22,879
Now, he may run and tell somebody that,
but that don't mean shit.

1319
01:33:22,954 --> 01:33:25,548
Glenn don't know
I changed the plan.

1320
01:33:25,624 --> 01:33:28,593
It's happenin' tonight.
Soon as we leave here.

1321
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:31,925
Go back by the house, pick up some shit
we gonna need, and we just gonna do it.

1322
01:33:37,902 --> 01:33:41,565
- Give me a minute to talk to Buddy.
- You got two minutes, that's all.

1323
01:33:41,639 --> 01:33:44,267
- Make up your mind, Foley.
- I wasn't asking permission.

1324
01:33:54,085 --> 01:33:57,384
- You know they're gonna set us up.
- I get that feeling, yeah.

1325
01:33:57,455 --> 01:33:59,889
You think you can get
to the diamonds before they do?

1326
01:34:01,992 --> 01:34:05,655
I'll make you a deal.
You get outta here right now.

1327
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:09,062
I'll do the job with Snoop. I'll meet
you anywhere you want, give you half.

1328
01:34:09,132 --> 01:34:12,932
- Half for doin' what?
- Gettin' me out of Glades, for starters.

1329
01:34:14,204 --> 01:34:16,729
Who's gonna watch
your back?

1330
01:35:59,773 --> 01:36:02,139
All right, White Boy.
House call.

1331
01:36:14,154 --> 01:36:16,884
[Kenny]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1332
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,094
[Doorbell Dings]

1333
01:36:24,331 --> 01:36:26,764
- Ready to do this, baby?
- Ready for whatever.

1334
01:36:26,832 --> 01:36:29,767
Cool. My shit always work.

1335
01:36:31,403 --> 01:36:34,167
Perennial Plumbing.

1336
01:36:35,441 --> 01:36:38,205
Somebody in the house called.

1337
01:36:38,277 --> 01:36:41,678
You don't know what you're talking
about, because no one was here.

1338
01:36:41,747 --> 01:36:44,238
- Let's go skiing.
- [Kenny] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1339
01:36:47,987 --> 01:36:49,921
You still got time
to take me up on my offer.

1340
01:36:49,989 --> 01:36:52,617
And leave you alone
with these assholes?

1341
01:36:54,793 --> 01:36:58,661
- Raymond Cruz.
- Ray, it's Karen Sisco.
I'm at Ripley's house.

1342
01:36:58,731 --> 01:37:01,358
I just saw Maurice Miller and four other
suspects force their way into the house.

1343
01:37:01,432 --> 01:37:03,366
They're armed.
I'm gonna need backup.

1344
01:37:03,668 --> 01:37:05,795
- Who are you?
- I work here.

1345
01:37:05,870 --> 01:37:07,963
I'm the maid. Fuck off!

1346
01:37:08,039 --> 01:37:11,236
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do:
Fuck you, then off you.
- Hey, not yet.

1347
01:37:11,309 --> 01:37:14,745
- Where Ripley at?
- He isn't here.

1348
01:37:14,812 --> 01:37:19,374
- Out for the evening or some shit?
- He's in Florida... Palm Beach.

1349
01:37:19,450 --> 01:37:23,250
- When's he due back?
- What difference does it make?
You gonna wait for him?

1350
01:37:23,321 --> 01:37:27,883
Mr. Ripley's down for the season.
Christmas to Easter.

1351
01:37:27,959 --> 01:37:30,951
Stop that shit, man.

1352
01:37:31,029 --> 01:37:33,190
You're here all by yourself?

1353
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:35,629
That's right. Just me.

1354
01:37:40,971 --> 01:37:44,099
- Where Ripley's safe at,
keeps his valuables in?
- I don't have any idea.

1355
01:37:44,174 --> 01:37:47,701
I fuckin' bet you don't.

1356
01:37:47,778 --> 01:37:51,077
We gonna take a look upstairs
in the man's bedroom, all right?

1357
01:37:51,148 --> 01:37:54,208
You and Mr. Buddy look
at all the rooms down here.

1358
01:37:54,284 --> 01:37:56,218
Check the paintings,
behind the walls.

1359
01:37:56,286 --> 01:37:59,687
Check the fuckin' walls
in the closets. The man's
got a safe. It's here somewhere.

1360
01:37:59,756 --> 01:38:01,781
What about his place
down in Florida?

1361
01:38:01,858 --> 01:38:05,123
If you called, we could have checked
the walls down there before we left.

1362
01:38:05,195 --> 01:38:08,630
That is, if you'd bothered to find out
where he was. You follow me?

1363
01:38:10,166 --> 01:38:12,600
Man, take this bitch upstairs.

1364
01:38:12,668 --> 01:38:15,637
Upstairs!

1365
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:20,334
Listen, you try and trip any alarms,
anything like that,

1366
01:38:20,409 --> 01:38:23,378
you gonna be a dead Hazel,
you understand me?

1367
01:38:25,348 --> 01:38:27,942
- Hey, hey, where we at? Where is it?
- Over there.

1368
01:38:28,017 --> 01:38:32,249
- Ever wear one of these?
- I don't ski.

1369
01:38:32,321 --> 01:38:35,688
Keep an eye on the maid.
I'll have a look around.

1370
01:38:40,329 --> 01:38:43,058
Go sit down. Please.

1371
01:38:48,136 --> 01:38:52,869
Damn, Mo. How's this motherfucker
livin', man? Shit!

1372
01:38:52,941 --> 01:38:56,001
Check behind the pictures
on the walls, man.

1373
01:38:59,447 --> 01:39:01,506
Hey, Mo. Found some rubbers.

1374
01:39:01,583 --> 01:39:04,381
White Boy, why the fuck
you lookin' under the mattress?

1375
01:39:04,452 --> 01:39:07,182
You know dude ain't gonna hide
no diamonds under there.

1376
01:39:07,255 --> 01:39:09,723
Damn! Dumb 'bama motherfucker.

1377
01:39:09,791 --> 01:39:14,592
- Where Foley at, man?
- He's checkin' the other rooms
like you said, boss.

1378
01:39:14,663 --> 01:39:18,928
[Chuckles]
Man, keep a eye on Foley.

1379
01:39:25,339 --> 01:39:27,864
[Static]

1380
01:39:27,941 --> 01:39:31,377
[Snoopy] Ken, stop fuckin'
with the radio, put on a CD.

1381
01:39:31,445 --> 01:39:35,040
- I don't recognize
none of these bands, Mo.
- Just pick somebody.

1382
01:39:35,115 --> 01:39:37,345
What, "How To Sing
Like Michael Bolton"?

1383
01:39:40,587 --> 01:39:43,181
What the fuck you wanna
listen to, huh?

1384
01:39:43,257 --> 01:39:47,751
- I like Schubert.
- Schubert? Well, I don't.

1385
01:39:51,898 --> 01:39:54,196
Uh, Foley?

1386
01:40:03,643 --> 01:40:05,577
Cool.

1387
01:41:06,036 --> 01:41:07,970
911 got you on hold, Richard?

1388
01:41:09,607 --> 01:41:11,541
- Foley!
- How you doin'?

1389
01:41:11,609 --> 01:41:13,804
What in God's name
is happening here?

1390
01:41:13,878 --> 01:41:16,711
- Who's upstairs?
- Snoopy Miller, couple of his friends.

1391
01:41:16,781 --> 01:41:19,841
- Maurice, from Lompoc?
- Yup.

1392
01:41:19,917 --> 01:41:21,851
Have they got Midge up there?

1393
01:41:21,919 --> 01:41:24,547
What kind of a man lets a woman
answer the door this time of night?

1394
01:41:24,622 --> 01:41:28,251
We thought it was her husband.
He comes here and checks up on her.

1395
01:41:28,325 --> 01:41:30,293
I'm supposed to be
down in Florida.

1396
01:41:30,361 --> 01:41:32,795
In a few minutes, you're gonna
wish you were. Let's go, come on.

1397
01:41:32,863 --> 01:41:34,921
Why don't you sit down?
We'll have a look at your fish.

1398
01:41:39,102 --> 01:41:43,129
Oh, that's workin'.
That's workin'.

1399
01:41:46,843 --> 01:41:48,834
[Gasps]

1400
01:41:48,912 --> 01:41:51,710
Motherfucker!
I found the safe, yo!

1401
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:56,184
Don't go nowhere.

1402
01:41:58,888 --> 01:42:03,382
- Oh, shit! We gonna have a party!
- Look at that bitch.

1403
01:42:15,003 --> 01:42:16,698
They found the safe.

1404
01:42:16,772 --> 01:42:19,468
- Fuck.
- Buddy, you remember
Richard, don't you?

1405
01:42:19,541 --> 01:42:23,102
- Yeah, hi. Nice house.
- Thank you.

1406
01:42:25,581 --> 01:42:27,879
Yeah, man.
We just all hit this handle,

1407
01:42:27,950 --> 01:42:29,884
blow this sucker
wide open, man.

1408
01:42:29,952 --> 01:42:32,716
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's get ready.

1409
01:42:32,788 --> 01:42:35,450
Oh, Dude... you're gonna
kill me with that.

1410
01:42:39,261 --> 01:42:41,957
- Where you been, man?
- Found some steaks.

1411
01:42:42,030 --> 01:42:44,896
- Steaks?
- Yeah, some big ones, bro.

1412
01:42:44,966 --> 01:42:46,991
Man, come on.
Blast this damn safe open, man.

1413
01:42:47,068 --> 01:42:51,027
- He's down there lookin' for food.
- Fool.

1414
01:42:51,105 --> 01:42:56,566
All right. Hold it. No.
Get to the side, man. All right.

1415
01:42:56,644 --> 01:43:00,239
On three.
One, two, three.

1416
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:05,676
- Jesus Christ, they're shooting Midge!
- Sit down, Dick.

1417
01:43:05,753 --> 01:43:07,812
They're trying to open up
the safe, not your maid.

1418
01:43:07,889 --> 01:43:12,690
[Laughing]
Oh, shit.

1419
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,694
Man, we didn't even crack
this sum' bitch.

1420
01:43:25,305 --> 01:43:27,773
- Okay, hit the hinges.
- Uh-huh.

1421
01:43:27,841 --> 01:43:30,639
Put your finger in your ear, man.
This is gonna be loud.

1422
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:33,679
All right, on three. One, two...

1423
01:43:33,747 --> 01:43:38,741
The combination is 3-10-44.

1424
01:43:41,021 --> 01:43:44,718
- Richard's birthday.
- Thank you.

1425
01:44:03,876 --> 01:44:06,003
Are they dead?

1426
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:09,914
We gotta find Foley, man.

1427
01:44:10,182 --> 01:44:12,980
Can't believe you're still angry with me
after all this time.

1428
01:44:13,052 --> 01:44:15,953
I'm not angry with you, Richard.
In fact, I'm completely relaxed.

1429
01:44:16,021 --> 01:44:20,117
The thing is, I can't figure if
it's the fish that are cooling me out,

1430
01:44:20,192 --> 01:44:24,288
or all those uncut diamonds
in the bottom of the tank, there.

1431
01:44:30,969 --> 01:44:32,903
Goddamn.

1432
01:44:32,971 --> 01:44:35,633
Dumb-fuck Glenn was right.
You got about 5 million worth in there?

1433
01:44:35,707 --> 01:44:37,641
Five point two.

1434
01:44:39,344 --> 01:44:41,642
They just look
like plain ol' rocks!

1435
01:44:41,713 --> 01:44:44,181
They sure do.
You wanna grab 'em, Buddy?

1436
01:44:50,755 --> 01:44:54,247
If I were you,
I'd get up and run.

1437
01:44:54,325 --> 01:44:57,488
- I'm not leaving Midge.
- Don't be an asshole.
They're gonna kill you.

1438
01:44:57,562 --> 01:45:01,588
Well, if that's my fate then so be it,
but I'm not leaving her.
I'm in love with her.

1439
01:45:04,601 --> 01:45:08,162
- Come on, Jack.
- Good luck, Richard.

1440
01:45:24,454 --> 01:45:27,981
- Come on, Jack.
- Shit. They're gonna rape
that maid, aren't they?

1441
01:45:28,058 --> 01:45:30,720
By the look of those guys,
they'll rip her too.

1442
01:45:30,794 --> 01:45:32,728
- Then they're gonna kill 'em.
- At least.

1443
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:37,165
Rip, Rip.

1444
01:45:37,233 --> 01:45:39,861
- Tricky motherfucker.
- Are those my suits?

1445
01:45:39,935 --> 01:45:43,871
Naw. These are my suits.
Look at you, man.

1446
01:45:44,807 --> 01:45:46,741
Where you been hidin', Dick?

1447
01:45:48,077 --> 01:45:50,011
We made it, didn't we?

1448
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:53,276
- All you gotta do is
get in the van, baby.
- I'm goin' back in.

1449
01:45:53,349 --> 01:45:56,750
- I'm goin' with you.
- No, you dump the van,
meet me at the airport.

1450
01:45:56,819 --> 01:45:58,980
- I'll get one of Ripley's cars.
- Jack...

1451
01:45:59,055 --> 01:46:03,355
The shit that's about to go
down here, you'll be on the phone
with your sister for a month.

1452
01:46:03,426 --> 01:46:07,863
- All I'm sayin' is we're square.
- Here.

1453
01:46:07,930 --> 01:46:10,329
Yep.

1454
01:46:10,398 --> 01:46:12,332
Jack.

1455
01:46:19,641 --> 01:46:21,575
Get outta here.

1456
01:46:40,361 --> 01:46:43,762
- Get that shit off.
- [Midge] Get your hands off me!

1457
01:46:43,832 --> 01:46:46,732
- Fuck you, shut up!
Nobody's gonna help you.
- [Midge Screaming]

1458
01:46:48,268 --> 01:46:51,863
- Midge!
- Fuck Midge, man.
Where the jewels at, Dick?

1459
01:46:51,939 --> 01:46:55,705
- Foley... Foley's got them.
Go after Foley!
- Where the fuck is Foley, man?

1460
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:04,784
Midge?

1461
01:47:10,824 --> 01:47:13,156
Midge! -
- Sit your punk ass down, man.

1462
01:47:14,394 --> 01:47:16,919
- Ooh, goddamn!
- Son of a bitch!

1463
01:47:16,997 --> 01:47:20,397
Man, take the front stairs.
I'm gonna take the back.

1464
01:47:23,136 --> 01:47:25,969
- You all right?
- Where's Richard?

1465
01:47:26,038 --> 01:47:29,735
He's downstairs.
You wait here.

1466
01:47:34,747 --> 01:47:38,444
Hold it, asshole.
Drop the gun.

1467
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:41,653
Drop it!

1468
01:47:41,721 --> 01:47:43,780
Put the damn gun down, now.

1469
01:47:44,957 --> 01:47:47,721
Now!

1470
01:47:47,793 --> 01:47:50,921
Put it down!

1471
01:47:54,099 --> 01:47:57,193
Stay right there.
Don't move. Maurice!

1472
01:47:57,269 --> 01:47:59,203
I got Foley!

1473
01:48:01,706 --> 01:48:03,640
Maurice!

1474
01:48:34,104 --> 01:48:36,868
[Laughing] Ain't got
another clip I can use, do you?

1475
01:48:36,941 --> 01:48:39,239
No, I don't.

1476
01:48:41,779 --> 01:48:45,306
- You ain't never shot
a gun before, have you?
- Not until recently, no.

1477
01:48:45,382 --> 01:48:47,816
- You a little nervous?
- Little bit, yeah.

1478
01:48:47,885 --> 01:48:52,481
You know, a situation like this
has a high potentiality...

1479
01:48:52,556 --> 01:48:54,490
for the common motherfucker
to bitch out.

1480
01:48:54,558 --> 01:48:57,322
- So I figure, why take a chance?
- [Gun Clicks]

1481
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:01,164
Bitch!

1482
01:49:03,733 --> 01:49:05,667
- Aw, sh...!
- Motherfucker!

1483
01:49:40,969 --> 01:49:43,028
Stop! Put your hands in the air!

1484
01:49:59,688 --> 01:50:01,622
Jack?

1485
01:50:03,091 --> 01:50:06,288
- I know you're up there.
- Shit!

1486
01:50:09,431 --> 01:50:12,331
- Where's Kenneth?
- He's up here.

1487
01:50:14,635 --> 01:50:16,967
He's dead.

1488
01:50:38,225 --> 01:50:41,956
- Come on, Jack, don't.
- Pretend it's not me.

1489
01:50:42,029 --> 01:50:45,157
- You think I'd shoot you?
- If you don't, somebody else will.

1490
01:50:45,232 --> 01:50:48,894
What're you now?
A desperado?

1491
01:50:48,968 --> 01:50:53,029
- Put the gun down.
- I'm not goin' back.

1492
01:50:55,075 --> 01:50:59,307
Jack, please, don't make me do this.
Put the gun down.

1493
01:51:02,082 --> 01:51:07,110
- Damn it, Jack, put the gun down!
- [Sirens In Distance]

1494
01:51:07,187 --> 01:51:09,121
No more time-outs.

1495
01:51:18,398 --> 01:51:21,127
You win, Jack.

1496
01:51:29,608 --> 01:51:33,066
- I can't shoot you.
- You did. You shot me.

1497
01:51:33,145 --> 01:51:35,375
You know what I mean.

1498
01:51:48,894 --> 01:51:53,456
I'm sorry.
I wish things were different.

1499
01:52:36,606 --> 01:52:38,540
Airport.

1500
01:53:05,668 --> 01:53:09,468
[Karen] Yeah, they don't know
yet if they want to bring him up
on the homicides.

1501
01:53:09,538 --> 01:53:12,371
I doubt if they will.
They'll just put a detainer on him.

1502
01:53:12,441 --> 01:53:15,410
When they're through with him here,
he'll go back to Florida.

1503
01:53:15,478 --> 01:53:17,810
[Mr. Sisko]
Are you gonna go get him?

1504
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:20,110
It's possible. Why?

1505
01:53:20,182 --> 01:53:22,116
Well, you know,
I was just thinkin'.

1506
01:53:22,184 --> 01:53:24,118
You can have a nice time
with him on the ride down,

1507
01:53:24,186 --> 01:53:27,178
picking up where your interlude
or whatever you call it left off,

1508
01:53:27,256 --> 01:53:30,089
and then you can throw him
in the shithouse.

1509
01:53:31,594 --> 01:53:33,824
[Karen]
He knew what he was doing.

1510
01:53:33,896 --> 01:53:36,797
Nobody forced him to rob banks.

1511
01:53:38,066 --> 01:53:41,900
[Mr. Sisko]
My little girl... the tough babe.

1512
01:53:41,970 --> 01:53:43,904
[Karen]
I'll call you later.

1513
01:53:43,972 --> 01:53:46,133
[Mr. Sisco]
Good-bye.

1514
01:54:03,525 --> 01:54:05,789
Jack.

1515
01:54:08,363 --> 01:54:10,297
I got you a present.

1516
01:54:13,066 --> 01:54:15,091
Something for the road.

1517
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:31,710
I'm gonna have to take it away,
though, soon as the ride is over.

1518
01:54:44,398 --> 01:54:47,298
Jack Foley?
Meet Hijirah Henry.

1519
01:54:58,010 --> 01:54:59,944
What kind of a name is Hijirah?

1520
01:55:00,012 --> 01:55:03,470
- It's Islamic.
- What's it stand for?

1521
01:55:03,549 --> 01:55:06,985
The "Hijirah" was Mohammed's
flight from Mecca in 622.

1522
01:55:07,053 --> 01:55:11,513
- His flight?
- Brothers in Leavenworth
gave me that name.

1523
01:55:11,591 --> 01:55:13,525
You were in Leavenworth, huh?

1524
01:55:13,593 --> 01:55:16,562
- Four time.
- Meaning?

1525
01:55:16,629 --> 01:55:19,655
- Meaning, time came, I left.
- You busted out.

1526
01:55:19,732 --> 01:55:23,258
I prefer to think of it as an exodus
from an undesirable place.

1527
01:55:26,571 --> 01:55:28,903
- How long before they
caught up with you?
- That time?

1528
01:55:31,176 --> 01:55:34,509
- There were others?
- Yeah. That was the ninth.

1529
01:55:36,514 --> 01:55:38,982
The ninth?

1530
01:55:39,050 --> 01:55:42,850
Well, ten if you count that prison
hospital in Ohio I walked away from.

1531
01:55:42,921 --> 01:55:45,719
- You done a lot of walkin', Henry.
- Hijirah.

1532
01:55:45,790 --> 01:55:49,155
Hijirah.
Now we're off to Glades.

1533
01:55:49,225 --> 01:55:53,355
Yeah, it looks that way.

1534
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:56,160
I was supposed to leave
last night with the lady marshal,

1535
01:55:56,230 --> 01:55:59,600
but for some reason
she wanted to wait.

1536
01:55:59,670 --> 01:56:03,570
- She did, huh?
- Guess it's cheaper taking
two of us down in one van.

1537
01:56:03,641 --> 01:56:08,875
Could be. Maybe she thought
we had a lot to talk about.

1538
01:56:08,945 --> 01:56:11,005
Really? Like what?

1539
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:17,350
I don't know.
Long ride to Florida.
