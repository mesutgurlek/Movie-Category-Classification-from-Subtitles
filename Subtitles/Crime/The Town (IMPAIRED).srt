[MAN]
Driver's name is Arthur Shea.

2
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,880
Former Medford police officer
57 years old.

3
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,390
Soon as his partner leaves with
the coal bag...

4
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,800
..,Artie cracks The Herald,
and he don't look up till the guy gets back.

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,890
Marty MacGuire,
Cummins Armored courier:

And he's about to get robbed.

10
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,110
We're fucked if we see a helicopter,
we're fucked if we see SWAT.

11
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,830
We see a cruiser, stop, take out
the engine blocks, keep moving.

12
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,240
No one needs to get hurt.

13
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,380
Now, these guards
like to test you, though.

14
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,460
They want to get hurt for $10 an hour,
don't get in the way.

15
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,880
Let's go.

You! Away from the computer!

[JEM] On the floor!
[GLOANS] I need everybody's BlackBerrys.

27
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,720
-Everybody on the floor.
[DEZ] Slide your BlackBerrys up.

28
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,310
[JEM]
Take off your fucking shoes!

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,770
[GLOANS] BlackBerrys to the front!
Slide your fucking phones up.

[DOUG] Bank manager, let's go.
Get up. Let's go.

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,450
Get up, come on, get up. Let's go.

35
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,960
Not you. You. Get up. Let's go.
Come on.

36

[JEM] You trying to be a hero?
[BEARNS] Jesus Christ!

00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,960
[DOUG] When's the time lock set for?
-9:00.

38
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,840
Don't lie to us, it's 8:15.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,130
Listen, it's not your money.
You understand? Don't lie to us again.

40
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,640
[GLOANS] Hey, sweetheart, in the corner.
Get in the corner. You too, brother-man.

41
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,440
[DOUG]
Go. Go.

42
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,030
No distress call. Open it clean.

43
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,370
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[JEM] Don't stall,

44
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,040
This guy a fucking friend of yours?

45
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,760
Let's go!

46
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,460
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,970
[DOUG]
Take your time, okay?

48
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,630
Breathe. Go.

49
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,740
[JEM]
Okay, get back. Get out of the way.

[DOUG]
We gotta go.

56
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,140
[JEM]
Let's go. Let's bleach it up.

57
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,850
[DOUG] Go, go, go.
[JEM] Let's bleach it up.

58
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,480
[DOUG] Come on, let's go. We gotta go.
[DEZ] Hold it. Silent alarm, this address.

59
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,560
[JEM] Who did it?
-Look, nobody did anything.

60
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,240
[JEM] What? Huh? What'd you say?
[BEARNS] Nobody did anything.

61
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,650
[JEM] You pull the alarm?
-No. No.

62
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,560
[JEM] Did you?
[BEARNS] I didn't pull any alarm.

63
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,110
[JEM] We were leaving,
you motherfucker! You fuck!

64
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,820
[DOUG]
Easy, easy. That's enough.

65
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,080
-All right? Easy.
[JEM] You fuck!

66
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,710
You fucker. We were out the door,
you fuck.

67
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,170
[DOUG]
Let's go.

68
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,010
[JEM]
Where's your purse?

69
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,190
[DOUG]
What the fuck is this?

70
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,860
[JEM] The cops get us walled in,
we're gonna need her.

71
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,940
Sit down. Go.

72
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,040
[DOUG]
Head for the boulevard.

73
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,510
You're gonna be okay.

74
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,130
All right? No one's gonna hurt you.

75
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,920
What's up?

76
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,710
Boosted a city work van.
Which still hasn't been reported stolen.

77
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,720
[FRAWLEY]
Probably too busy working.

78
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,090
Used the van to screen the door.

79
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,350
Bleached the entire place for DNA.

80
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,970
Kills all the clothing fiber,
so we can't get a match.

81
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,600
Silent bell
came from cage number two.

82
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,760
Assistant manager's at Beth Israel.

83
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,600
Our guys waited for the time lock
to expire...

84
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,270
...then they had the manager
open sesame.

85
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,740
Under duress?

86
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,780
[DINO]
I don't know.

87
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,770
[FRAWLEY]
Ten foot steel safe.

88
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,490
Only as strong
as the guy with the key.

89
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,580
Found the dye packs and the tracers.

90
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,910
[PHONE RINGS]

91
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,550
Found the van, Torched.

92
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,050
-Where is it?
-Where do you think?

93
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,150
[FRAWLEY] Nice to be back home, Dino?
[DINO] Yeah.

94
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,810
It's all the love I get
makes the homecoming feel so warm.

95
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,560
Could be 50 people here
eyewitnessed these guys.

96
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,450
And 50 hands on a bible
saying they never saw nothing.

97
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,120
Well, it's a pro job.

98
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,490
All the pro guys I know are away...

99
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,830
,..so I guess we got new pro guys.

100
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,930
The part of the job where
we get to do something...

101
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,010
,..that has no point and yields no results.
Excuse me.

102
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,560
Anybody see who lit this van on fire?

103
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,400

Is that where we are now?

Where's Jem?

to light a couple house tires...

106

,..stick up a liquor store, maybe,
I don't know.

107
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,500
-Are we taking hostages now?
-No, we're not taking hostages now.

-What?
-Well, look.

on the street every day?

She didn't see anything.

121
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,990
[DEZ]
Jesus, are you sure?

122
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,240
-Taking her for a ride didn't help.
-Yeah.

Oh, fuck.
All right. I'm gonna handle it.

like a fucking A car, we'll find out.

-If she needs to get scared.

-She's already scared.
-Well, maybe not scared enough.

I see you've given
a preliminary statement.

132
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,600
I want to talk to you
about your abduction.

Okay.

134
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,730
-I understand they threatened you.
-Mm-hm.

135
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,490
One of them took my license.

136
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,120
And did you try to escape
at any point?

137
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,160
No.

138
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,870
Is there anything you can identify
about the men? Anything you'd testify to?

139
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,500
I didn't try to escape
because they had guns.

140
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,260
I understand.

141
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,920

-Yeah. They just let me go.

When someone endures
an experience like this...

144
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,810
,..there are very often
residual effects.

145
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,310
It's gonna be okay.

146

Did they say anything?

"if you talk to the FBI, we'll come
to your house and fuck you and kill you."

-I'll do it.
-Why are you gonna do it?

150
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,820
You're the reason
we're having this conversation.

151
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,660
-I'm gonna get it done.
-What are you gonna get done? Huh?

in the bank with an AK...

Three hundred and seventy

More per capita than
anywhere else in the world.

90 percent of them...

how to work the box.

But I like the way they zapped the BPT
to the D-5 station.

463
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,710
How does one learn how to do that?

I have follow-up questions about your case.

Is there somewhere we can meet?

[FRAWLEY] Why didn't you tell me
you lived in Charlestown?

You don't like your sandwich?

475
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,170
It's the unfortunate nagging suspicion
you get as an FBI agent..

476
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:50,550
...who has put a lot of neighborhood
people in federal prison...

Come on, I don't think
anyone would do that.

And then they stopped and let me out
over at the beach and ....

And one of the guys told me...

,..to walk until I felt the water
on my toes.

570
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,580
[CLAIRE]
When the guy attacked David...

571
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,340
,..l could see the back of his neck
and he had a tattoo.

572
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,840
Of what?

573
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,470
It was one of those
Fighting Irish tattoos.

574

I'm afraid if I report it
they'll make me testify.

and I'm sure he does...

578
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,480
,..they'll have his tattoos on tile.

579
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,950
They'll ring him up the next day.

580

Robbery, weapons. He'll get 30 years.

581
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,830
Course, they'll worry someone's
gonna come looking for the witness.

582
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:58,870
The FBI will probably want to put you in
WITSEC, you know, Witness Security.

583
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,090
You know, they'll probably put you
somewhere, like, you know, in Cleveland...

584
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,470
,..or Arizona, you know,
somewhere safe.

585
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,130
Or,..

586
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,260
,..you could wait.

00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,400
There's nothing says you gotta play it
right away.

589
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,680
You're the one who's vulnerable
in this situation right now.

590
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,690

like anyone else.

They wanna find the bad guy so they
can go home and nuke their supper.

592
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,070
You have to look out
for yourself, Claire.

593
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:34,700
Quite an expert.

594
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,250
Not really.

595
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,080
Just watch a lot of TV.

596
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,960
I watch a lot of CSI.

00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,130
So I'm a really big expert
on all this. I know.

598
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,720
And Miami CSI and New York CSI.

599
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,760
All of them, I watch.

600
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,270
You'll be well-prepared.

601
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,800
And Bones.

602
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:04,980
Do we know each other well enough for
me to say that this truck is a little much?

603
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,270
It's my work truck.

604
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,610
If you have problems with your Prius
I can throw it in the back.

605
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,770
How did you know I had a Prius?

606
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,780
Took a guess.
I mean, it just seemed like a toonie car.

607
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,790
-Why, do you really have a Prius?
-Yeah.

608
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,330
-Really?
-I had a Prius.

609
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,500
-It got vandalized, of course.
-What happened?

610
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:29,040
Doesn't matter. Now I'm forced to walk
a mile through the projects.

611
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:32,590
-There were these guys and they started ....
-What?

612

00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:48,120
,..so they executed both of them
with their own weapons.

[DINO] MacRay did eight months
for going over the counter at a BayBank...

767

...with a nail gun
after he washed out from pro hockey.

-Pro hockey?
[DINO] Yeah, he was a big deal for a minute.

Got drafted, went to camp,
and here's the shocker:

Started making trouble,
fighting with guys.

from a grand jury here.

No.

What? Why do you look like that?

793
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:16,380
-My brother died on a day like this.
-When was this?

794

He was little. He had lymphoma.

So now on really sunny days
I always think of someone dying.

...because they trust him,
and then turns around...

...and use those secrets against them,
put those people in prison?

Desmond Elden.

1221
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:17,060
Part of a crew that we tied
into the bank job at North End...

1222
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:21,320
,..and at least three other
armored car robberies.

1223
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:27,320
Look familiar?

1224
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:32,530
You opened the safe for him.

1225
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,700
He left you unharmed...

1226
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:40,920
...and now the two of you are carrying on a
relationship about which you lied to the FBI.

1227
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,170
I was wrong.

1228
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:45,040
You do need a lawyer.

Something wrong with the apartment?

1230
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:57,060
[JEM]
No, Florist.

1231
01:27:57,970 --> 01:27:59,140
Florist? What?

1232
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:00,810
Came through.

1233
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:04,560
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-it's large, Dougy.

1234
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:06,900
-it's large.
-We're smoked. Punt it.

1235
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:10,200
-Who else is gonna buy it?
-You should've thought about that...

1236
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,950
,..before you kept breaking the guy off
for 40 dimes.

1237
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:15,450
-There's an expectation for me.
-I'll correct it.

1238
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:19,240
-Oh, you will? Okay.
-Yeah. Look.

1239
01:28:19,410 --> 01:28:24,580
Look, pick up an extra guy. All right?
Or go with three guys.

1240
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:27,080
Or fucking be smart and boot it.

1241
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:29,220
Oh, so you're not going?

1242
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:31,630
No.

1243
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:34,840
And why's that?

1244
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:37,350
Because we got a ton of heat on us,
for one thing.

1245
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:39,930
We'll put a move on.
We've done it a hundred times.

1246
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:43,140
You know what? Forget it.
Do what you want to do. I'm done.

1247
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:44,930
-What? What?
-I'm done.

1248
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:47,440
-You're done?
-What does it sound like?

1249
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,280
-I don't know. What's that mean?
-What you think it means?

1250
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,910
What does that mean?
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

1251
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:56,950
Let me put it to you this way - I'm putting
this whole fucking town in my rear-view.

1252
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:01,780
There's people I can't let you
walk away from.

1253
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,460
What?

1254
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,620
Who?

1255
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,670
Come on.

1256
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,590
Are you serious, Jimmy?

1257
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,800
She's not my kid.

1258
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:24,020
I mean, come the f-- Cut it out.

1259
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:26,270
All you give a fuck about
is coke and Xbox...

1260
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:29,310
,..now you're trying to play it off
like you care about Shyne?

You think you're better than people.

Mr. Fucking-Clean.
Mr. Fucking-Goddamn-High-and-Mighty.

1263
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:38,110
I'm better than all these people.
I'm better than everybody.

1264
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,530
But you grew up right here.

1265
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:43,210
Same rules that I did.

1266
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:45,040
Okay.

1267
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:47,040
What else?

1268
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,670
Who the fuck's the father?

1269
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:54,000
-I know I'm not.
-You were the one fucking her.

1270
01:29:54,170 --> 01:29:56,420
Yeah, I wasn't the only one, brother.

1271
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:58,890
Okay? She knew
l knew I'm not the father...

1272
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:01,640
,..and I have enough respect for her
not to ask her.

1273
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:03,520
Because I don't think she knows.

1274
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,520
I don't wanna shatter
your illusions here, partner.

1275
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,810
There aren't enough free clinics
in Mattapan...

1276
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:11,570
,..to ind out who the father
of that kid is.

1277
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:14,570
I don't know who the fuck
you think you are either.

1278
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:17,950
You aren't letting me
or not letting me do shit, all right?

1279
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:19,780
Here's a little cheat sheet for you.

1280
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:23,040
It's never gonna be me and you
and your sister and Shyne...

1281
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:24,790
,..fucking playing house up there.

1282
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:28,250
All right? You got it?
Get that in your fucking head!

1283
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:31,410
I'm tired of your one-way
fucking bullshit.

1284
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:35,710
If you wanna see me again,
come down and visit me in Florida.

[JEM]
Cunt.

1286
01:31:10,910 --> 01:31:12,830
In the 302,..

1287
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:16,300
,..feds have me dropping Brendan
right here.

1288
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,180
I got him back on Tibbetts.

1289
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,760
Shot him right in the chest.

1290
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,600
I remember he looked at me.

1291
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:30,260
I don't know who was more fucking
surprised he wasn't dead, him or me.

1292
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:32,600
We just kind of stood there...

1293
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:36,740
,..for a second, like, waiting for some
shit to happen. I don't know what.

1294
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:39,610
He started running.

1295
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:43,080
Fucking guy ran 100 yards
with a bullet in his heart, Dougy.

1296
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:47,370
I mean, the fucking guy should've ran track.
You know what I'm saying?

1297
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:52,830
I didn't ask you to do that.

1298
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,120
Yeah, well, you didn't have to, Dougy.
Come on.

1299
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:59,710
They told me Brendan was coming down
here to roll up on you with a Glock 21,

1300
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,850
So I came over here,
and I put him in the fucking ground.

1301
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,430
Did nine years for it.

1302

I'm grateful for everything you done
for me.

Your family took me in
when my father went away.

1306
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:26,580
You're like a brother to me.

1307

in the back.

01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:00,940
Listen, just wanted to stop by
and tell you myself...

1314
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:04,440
...whatever this thing is you got
going on...

1315
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:07,700
...I think my guys can handle it
without me. You know what I mean?

1316
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,860
I wouldn't hire them without you.

1317
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:11,950
And I wouldn't hire you without them.

1318
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:13,370
You're a unit.

1319
01:33:13,530 --> 01:33:17,330
Look, with all due respect,
I didn't come here for a debate.

1320
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:19,540
I'm not doing it.

1321
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:23,670
So, you know, work it out
however you can. I ....

1322
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,640
Calm down. Okay?

1323
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,720
It goes against
my better judgment...

1324
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:33,560
,..but just out of respect,
smooth things over...

1325
01:33:34,050 --> 01:33:36,350
,..just take this for it, all right?

1326
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:38,020
Not gonna cut it.

1327
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:41,730
Do you think I'm gonna put
Joe Flipperhead on this?

1328
01:33:42,230 --> 01:33:44,200
You're gonna do what I ask.

[DOUG]
Not gonna cut it, huh?

1330
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:49,400
Okay.

1331
01:33:49,570 --> 01:33:52,670
Let me ask you something.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1332
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:55,170
The only guy in Charlestown
with a gun?

1333

You guys run numbers and pump dope.

1334
01:33:57,660 --> 01:34:00,760
You're an old guy who don't know
his glory years are behind him.

1335
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:03,920
I ain't fucking working for you.
Got it?

1336
01:34:04,590 --> 01:34:09,010
You got a problem with that, I live at
551 Bunker Hill Street. Stop by anytime.

1337
01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:10,890
You know where to find me.

1338
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:13,560
You're gonna do this for me,..

1339
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:16,100
,..or I'm gonna clip your nuts...

1340
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:17,900
,..like I clipped your daddy's.

1341
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:20,060
Don't talk about my father.

1342
01:34:20,230 --> 01:34:22,770
Son, I knew your daddy.

1343
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:25,860
He worked for me for years. Years.

1344
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,490
Then he wanted his own thing.

1345
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,280
You play the horses?

1346
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:38,830
You know, they either geld a horse
with a knife...

1347
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:40,960
,..or with the chemicals.

1348
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:43,550
When your daddy said no to me...

1349
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,970
,..l did him the chemical way.

1350
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:48,300
Gave your mother a taste.

1351
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:50,090
Put the hook into her.

1352
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:52,810
She doped up good and proper.

Hung herself with a wire
on Melnea Cass.

1354
01:34:57,010 --> 01:34:59,940
And you? Running around
the neighborhood, looking for her.

1355
01:35:00,810 --> 01:35:03,150
Your daddy didn't have the heart
to tell his son...

1356
01:35:03,310 --> 01:35:06,480
,..that he was looking for a suicide doper
who was never coming home.

she ain't in it.

02:16:39,850 --> 02:16:41,060
Mm-hm.

1834
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:47,480
I don't think
that's a good idea for me.

1835
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:52,490
Why?

1836
02:16:57,820 --> 02:16:59,620
What if there are police there?

1837
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:03,250
There's no one here.

1838
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,920
All right, well, if you think I should
probably come by there...

1839
02:17:12,090 --> 02:17:14,510
,..then I guess that's what I'll do. Yeah.

1840
02:17:16,010 --> 02:17:17,180
Okay.

1841
02:17:18,680 --> 02:17:21,480
Claire, listen, I'm--
Listen. Listen to me.

1842
02:17:23,640 --> 02:17:25,140
I'm sorry, okay?

1843
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:28,780
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

1844
02:17:30,190 --> 02:17:31,530
Remember that.

1845
02:17:32,230 --> 02:17:35,200
Come down in the back
and let me in in about an hour:

1846
02:17:38,030 --> 02:17:39,500
All right?

1847
02:17:41,370 --> 02:17:42,990
I'll see you.

1848
02:17:44,410 --> 02:17:46,210
Wait, Doug? Doug?

1849
02:17:47,330 --> 02:17:48,800
-Yeah.
-I want you to come.

1850
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:51,880
I really wanna see you.

1851
02:17:56,590 --> 02:17:59,560
It'll be just like one of my sunny days.

1852
02:18:11,850 --> 02:18:13,070
Well...

1853
02:18:15,230 --> 02:18:16,910
,..I'm on my way then.

1854
02:18:19,740 --> 02:18:20,740
Bye.

1855
02:18:24,410 --> 02:18:26,330
Goodbye, Claire.

1856
02:18:32,460 --> 02:18:34,680
All right,
I'd say we've done our part here.

1857
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:37,460
You know what? Not now.

1858
02:18:43,430 --> 02:18:46,270
He says he's coming, I want people
at Logan, South Station...

1859
02:18:46,430 --> 02:18:48,810
...downtown, Greyhound,
subway, everything. Now.

1860
02:18:48,980 --> 02:18:51,230
[DINO] The city's covered.
[FRAWLEY] Good.

1861
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,750
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
We 're secure, and everything 's ready.

1862
02:19:23,010 --> 02:19:26,980
-Sir, we need you to stay off the street.
-Just going to work. No problem.

1863
02:19:43,150 --> 02:19:44,910
-How long?
-Forty minutes.

1864
02:19:45,410 --> 02:19:47,280
-Alleyway clear?
-Yes, sir.

1865
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:03,890
[MAN OVER RADIO] We got nothing.
Still no movement in the alley. Over.

1866
02:20:05,260 --> 02:20:08,510
Well, I guess he didn't have as big a thing
for you as you thought.

1867
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:12,110
I guess not.

1868
02:20:33,910 --> 02:20:35,510
"My sunny days."

1869
02:20:43,090 --> 02:20:45,890
You know, Claire,
we are a national organization.

1870
02:20:53,930 --> 02:20:57,030
All right, boys, let's pack it up.
He ain't coming.

1871
02:20:57,190 --> 02:20:59,660
Let's get the description out.
Let's go.

1872
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:01,740
We know what he looks like.

1873
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:04,120
Let's go ind him.

1874
02:21:07,740 --> 02:21:08,860
All right. You good?

1875
02:21:09,030 --> 02:21:10,830
Hey, best possible outcome, you know.

1876
02:21:10,990 --> 02:21:12,920
Well done, well done.

1877
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:52,170
It's for you.

1878
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:00,940
[DOUG]
Claire, take this.

1879
02:23:01,230 --> 02:23:03,860
You'll do better with it than I can.

1880
02:23:04,480 --> 02:23:07,070
By the time you read this,
I'll be long gone.

1881
02:23:07,230 --> 02:23:08,530
Not the way I planned it...

1882
02:23:09,030 --> 02:23:13,080
...but for the first time in my life,
l?n leaving this city.

1883
02:23:25,670 --> 02:23:26,720
Maybe if I go...

1884
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:29,420
...I can stop looking.

1885
02:23:51,440 --> 02:23:53,160
No matter how much you change...

1886
02:23:53,320 --> 02:23:56,250
You still have to pay the price
for the things you've done.

1887
02:23:59,410 --> 02:24:01,250
So I got a long road.

1888
02:24:06,920 --> 02:24:09,260
But I know I'll see you again.

1889
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:17,090
This side or the other.
