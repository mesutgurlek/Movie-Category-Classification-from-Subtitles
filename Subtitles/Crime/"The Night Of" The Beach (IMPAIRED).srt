- What? Where are we going?

163
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:55,470
Thank you.

164
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:56,872
Fuck you!

165
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:00,575
Uh, officer,

166
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,177
do you know where
Stanton Street is, please?

167
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:05,046
You're driving a cab downtown and you
don't know where Stanton Street is?

168
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:06,648
It's my first week.

169
00:09:06,682 --> 00:09:09,050
Down Second, Houston going east,

170
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:10,285
make a right wherever you can.

171
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:11,720
All right. Thank you.

172
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,594
(door opens)

173
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:21,196
Yo, guys, I'm off-duty!

174
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,265
Woman: What?

175
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:30,305
Um, I'm supposed to be off-duty.

176
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,708
You are? Your light isn't on.

177
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:36,711
Yeah, I know, it's, uh...

178
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:39,414
See, I don't know where the light is

179
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:41,216
- (horns honking)
- 'cause it's not my cab.

180
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,852
Are you gonna make me get out?

181
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:49,524
Where do you wanna go?

182
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,194
What do you mean?

183
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:56,364
Well, you got in my cab, so, like,
where do you want me to take you?

184
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,734
The beach.

185
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,203
The beach?

186
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:02,671
Yeah, the beach.

187
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,740
Um...

188
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:08,610
we're in Manhattan, so...

189
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:10,479
uh, I could do a river?

190
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:12,447
A river would be fine.

191
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:14,850
Not down here, though. Go uptown.

192
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,221
Okay.

193
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:29,831
I really would like to get going.

194
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:30,765
Yeah.

195
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,167
- Sorry.

197
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:51,953
What?

198
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:53,989
How far uptown?

199
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:57,659
Far.

200
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,781
I'm thirsty.

201
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,914

202
00:11:58,588 --> 00:12:01,022
And, uh, let me use the
restroom real quick, please?

203
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,826
Thanks.

204
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:18,440
You wanna be my next passenger?

205
00:12:25,915 --> 00:12:27,349
All right, thanks, man.

206
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:30,151
Uh, you can keep that. Thanks.

207
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:04,619
What's up with him?

208
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:08,056
Who cares?

209
00:13:35,551 --> 00:13:38,019
So, whose is it?

210
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:39,387
What?

211
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:40,588
The cab.

212
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:42,424
You said it wasn't yours when I got in.

213

I didn't think you heard anything I said.

214

I don't miss much.

215

Uh, it's my dad's.

216
00:13:53,536 --> 00:13:55,603
Actually, it's like, one-third my dad's.

217
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:57,839
He owns it with, like, two other guys.

218
00:13:57,873 --> 00:14:00,909
And you just use it whenever?

219
00:14:00,943 --> 00:14:03,044
Yeah.

220
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:04,679
Actually, no.

221
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:06,314
Just tonight.

222
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:09,417
Why tonight?

223
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:13,021
There's, like, this party
I didn't want to miss.

224
00:14:13,055 --> 00:14:15,590
Was.

225
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:17,258
- Is.
- Now.

00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:18,226
Yeah.

227
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,661
So, you're missing it.

228
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:20,962
Yeah.

229
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:24,532
Because of me.

230
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,331
So, you close to him?

231
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:57,732
Who, my dad?

232
00:14:59,034 --> 00:15:00,835
Yeah. Pretty much.

233
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,936
He's a good dad?

234
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:04,405
Yeah.

235
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,174
Yeah, yours?

236
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,809
He was okay.

237
00:15:07,843 --> 00:15:10,011
Oh, I'm sorry.

238
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:16,050
Friday night. Full moon. The river.

just do what you gotta do,

wants you to do, but...

Do you ever wish you could
just transport yourself?

253

Something bad happens here,
and suddenly you're over there?

Hey, I think it's pretty late, so...

366
00:26:59,154 --> 00:27:00,521
I should probably get going.

367
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,857
I gotta get home, so...

368
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:19,974
Hey.

369
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,894
Fuck!

370
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:33,781

Roll your window down.

378
00:31:11,806 --> 00:31:12,740
Huh?

379
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:15,709
Roll the window down.

380
00:31:15,744 --> 00:31:17,377
Roll it down.

381
00:31:20,014 --> 00:31:23,183
So, let me ask you, in your own
words, what does "no left turn" mean?

382
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:26,220
Uh...

383
00:31:26,254 --> 00:31:27,755
I must have missed the sign, I...

384
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:29,623
License, registration, and insurance.

385
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,597
Come on.

386
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:37,698
Give it to him.

387
00:31:37,732 --> 00:31:38,899
Over here.

388
00:31:44,305 --> 00:31:45,906
How much did you drink tonight?

389
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,874
Huh?

390
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:47,908
I don't drink.

391
00:31:47,942 --> 00:31:49,143
- No?
- Nothing, I don't drink.

392
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:52,079
No? 'Cause I'm getting high
just conversating with you.

393
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:53,680
Step out of the car.

394
00:31:56,651 --> 00:31:57,918
Out.

395
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:01,755
And I got a song request.

396
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,292
How 'bout you play me, maybe,
two bars of "Little Brown Jug."

397
00:32:07,262 --> 00:32:08,729
Do I have to?

398
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:10,264
No, see that right there, that's a mistake.

399
00:32:10,298 --> 00:32:13,700
I'm gonna explain this to you since
I can see you're a little confused.

400
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:15,702
- Yes, you may politely refuse...
- I can't...

401
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:16,904
I'm not done.

402
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:18,705
You refuse, it's a separate offense,

403
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,841
which is an automatic
arrest. Is that what you want?

404
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,676
- No.
- Officer: Hey, Cass.

405
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,347
Put your hands on the car.

406
00:32:32,987 --> 00:32:35,489
Listen, nothing comes up on this guy.

407
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:37,624
So why don't we just make
this reckless driving?

408
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,126
- It's a lot less paperwork.
- Ugh.

409
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,727
Come on, it's late.

410
00:32:40,762 --> 00:32:43,564
I don't want to do reckless driving.
I feel like he's done more than that.

411
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:45,165
Come on. He's like a kid.

412
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,434
- Kids do stuff...
- (radio beeps)

413
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:49,369
65th and Central Park West.

414
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:52,472
- Radio: Copy.
- Come on, what do you say?

415
00:32:52,507 --> 00:32:53,707
Yeah, copy?

416
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:56,176
Radio: Please respond, 1031 at...

417
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:57,644
You know what tonight is?

418
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,980
- Huh?
- It's your lucky night.

419
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:01,415
I can go?

420
00:33:01,449 --> 00:33:03,984
Did I say that?

421
00:33:04,018 --> 00:33:06,119
Break-in on 87th, we gotta go.

422
00:33:06,154 --> 00:33:08,589
What about Cheech and Chong, here,
what are we gonna do with him?

423
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:10,490
I don't know. Cut him loose?

424
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:13,560
Bring him with us?

425
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:14,461
I can't.

426
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:17,030
Is... Excuse me, is
somebody talking to you?

427
00:33:17,065 --> 00:33:18,265
- What...
- Shut up.

428
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,767
I can't leave my father's cab here.

429
00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:22,135
What are you talking about?

430
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,938
It's my dad's cab. I can't just
leave it. He needs it for work.

431
00:33:27,308 --> 00:33:30,711
Well, call him to come get
it. Else it's gonna get towed.

432
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:31,845
- Let's go, in the back.
- Come on, let's go.

433
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,181
- There's no car for him to come get the car.
- In the back.

434
00:33:34,215 --> 00:33:36,984
That's fine, that's fine. You'll
call him from the precinct.

435
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:38,552
Hey, cuffs?

436
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,153
No, I don't think so.

437
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:41,822
He needs it for work,

438
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:44,758
- and there's no way...
- Yeah, I know. You call him, when you get to the precinct,

439
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:46,927
you tell him where it is, and
he'll come and get it. Let's go.

440
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:48,729
Watch your head. There you go. Inside.

441
00:33:57,672 --> 00:33:59,339
What street is this?

442
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:21,962
- You the gentleman that called?
- Yeah.

443
00:34:21,996 --> 00:34:23,463
Okay, so what's going on?

444
00:34:23,498 --> 00:34:25,532
So, I hear something, you know?

445
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:26,934
A glass breaking.

446
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:30,370
And then from my window,
I see an open door.

447
00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:32,906
I see this man go through the door,

448
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:35,909
and then he comes back
out a few seconds later.

449
00:34:35,944 --> 00:34:38,612
Then I see him running down the street

450
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:40,314
and get into a cab.

451
00:34:40,348 --> 00:34:42,015
Race?

452
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,318
Could have been light-skinned black,

453
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:46,386
uh, Latino, I really don't know.

454
00:34:46,421 --> 00:34:47,988
Not Caucasian, though?

455
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:49,289
Could have been, sure, why not?

456
00:34:49,324 --> 00:34:52,326
(talking indistinctly)

457
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:57,097
Clothes?

458
00:34:57,131 --> 00:34:59,166
He wore clothes.

459
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,201
I'm sorry. Uh, dark, maybe.

460
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:02,936
Okay, maybe, and he took a cab.

461
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:04,304
Yeah, a cab.

462
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:07,174
Okay, sir, can you just wait
right here for us, please?

463
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,475
- Here? Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Thank you.

464
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:10,010
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

465
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:35,569
- Officer: What do you got?
- Cass: We got a break-in.

466
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:37,270
One eyewit, this gentleman here.

467
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:39,239
Sees male, undetermined race,

468
00:35:39,273 --> 00:35:41,508
goes in, comes out, runs down the street,

469
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:42,909
gets into a cab.

470
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:44,244
Anyone inside?

471
00:35:44,278 --> 00:35:45,545
Waiting on you.

472
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,680
Who's that in the car?

473
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:49,916
Cass: No one. He was with
us when we got the call.

474
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:53,320
He's not drunk, I can see that. He's
just driving like a fucking idiot.

475
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:54,921
Fine. Let's go.

476
00:35:59,994 --> 00:36:02,996
Cass: Uh, sir, we're
off-shift like, two hours ago.

477
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:04,698
Can you just take him in?

478
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:06,833
Let's go inside.

479
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:08,235
Flashlight.

480
00:36:10,638 --> 00:36:12,305
Hello?

481
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,275
NYPD! Anybody home?

482
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:26,686
Hello?

483
00:36:57,185 --> 00:36:59,619
Excuse me sir, take a step back.

484
00:36:59,654 --> 00:37:00,821
Sorry.

485
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:19,239
Hey, Teddy? Yeah, it's Jerry.

486
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:22,175
I'm at this break-in on 87th.

487
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,177
Gonna need additional units.

488
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:26,346
EMTs, Night Watch,

489
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,148
CSU, and an ME.

490
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,617
Are you puking?

491
00:37:30,651 --> 00:37:31,985
Tell me you're not puking.

492
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,054
I'm gagging, I'm not puking.

493
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:36,857
For fuck's sake, you gonna do that,
you can do it in the trunk of your car.

494
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:38,492
This is a nice neighborhood.

495
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,360
Is this guy still here?

496
00:37:40,394 --> 00:37:42,129
Cass: We're still here,
where is he gonna go?

497
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:48,702
TV: Now I'm always respectful of the
fact that this is a great predator

498
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:50,337
(phone ringing)

499
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:53,073
TV: and certainly, if it wanted
to, could take me out very easily.

500
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:54,374
Night Watch.

501
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:56,409
Yeah, hey, it's Sergeant Klein at the 2-1.

502
00:37:56,444 --> 00:38:01,281
We got a suspicious DOA
at 144 West 87th Street.

503
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:04,217
Inside or out?

504
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:05,852
What's suspicious about it?

505
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:08,288
What's suspicious about it?

506
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:13,426
Knife wounds.

507
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:16,029
Stomach...

508
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:17,731
Chest...

509
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:20,333
Hands...

510
00:38:20,368 --> 00:38:22,736
Fatal...

511
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:27,674
So, there's no way this could
wait for the day tour, huh?

512
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:30,010
Unresponsive.

513
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:31,978
Yeah, no vitals at the time of arrival.

514
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:34,047
That was like, 10 minutes ago.

515
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:35,815
Let's say, 0220?

516
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:38,351
All right.

517
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:45,325
- Who's here?
- What do you mean?

518
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,826
I mean who's here?

519
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:47,694
You.

520
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,429
Everybody else is up at Harlem Hospital.

521
00:38:49,463 --> 00:38:50,664
Those Agg-Assaults.

522
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:52,799
Are Paul Mason and Shiyanov there?

523
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:56,336
And don't give me any shit about
"life is cheap above 96th Street."

524
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,571
We're cool.

525
00:38:57,605 --> 00:38:59,272
(sighs)

526
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:03,410
You know what?

527
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:06,046
I'll call him.

528
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,281
- Box?
- Yeah.

529
00:39:10,084 --> 00:39:11,918
I was gonna say.

530
00:39:11,953 --> 00:39:16,523
(phone ringing)

531
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:21,928
(groans)

532
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,534
Box.

533
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:30,437
Dennis. Danny Lang, Night Watch.

534
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:31,605
Sorry to wake you.

535
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,907
Just thought you might want to
get in on this from the jump.

536
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:35,141
Box: What do you got?

537
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:37,877
Lang: Stabbing. Female, early 20s.

538
00:39:37,912 --> 00:39:41,715
144 West 87th Street. Inside.

539
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:42,816
Brownstone?

540
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,986
Yeah. It's gonna get
pretty photogenic out there.

541
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,790
(hip-hop playing)

542
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:53,221
_

543
00:40:03,938 --> 00:40:10,977
(opera playing)

544
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:22,289
- Where do you think you're going?
- Detective Box, son.

545
00:40:22,323 --> 00:40:23,723
Sorry, boss.

546
00:40:25,493 --> 00:40:28,328
Get the door before 10
more people trample through.

547
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:40,740
Who made the call?

548
00:40:40,775 --> 00:40:42,976
Neighbor over there.

549
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,578
Anybody else see anything?

550
00:40:45,613 --> 00:40:47,347
- Apparently not.
- Cameras?

551
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,783
There's one up the street.
We're not sure if it's working.

552
00:40:49,817 --> 00:40:51,651
Pulling the film.

553
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:53,053
Who's that?

554
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:55,355
- He's ours.
- Reckless driving.

555
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:57,557
You picked him up and brought
him here? What the fuck for?

556
00:40:57,591 --> 00:40:59,459
Well, we just pulled him
over when the call comes in...

557
00:40:59,493 --> 00:41:00,660
Well, I don't want him here.

558
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:02,796
Get a unit. Take him back to
the house or cut him loose.

559
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,066
- Uh, we'll take him, sir. We're off-duty...
- Not you. You stay.

560
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,801
Let's get the neighbor
back to the house, too.

561
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:09,502
He's famous enough out here already.

562
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:11,905
No smoking on my crime scene.

563
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:13,306
Go ahead, sir.

564
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:18,712
All right, let's go.

565
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:20,814
Where?

566
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:22,682
Just get out of the car.

567
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:46,539
Box wants you to take him to the station.

568
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:03,423
Nice-looking kid.

569
00:42:04,592 --> 00:42:05,625
Yeah.

570
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,635
What'd he do?

571
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:17,570
- Who?
- Him.

572
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:21,074
I don't know, he's a witness, isn't he?

573
00:42:23,411 --> 00:42:26,846
Hey, what'd you see?

574
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:29,849
I didn't see nothing.

575
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:32,552
Some witness he gon' make.

576
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,627
Is she dead?

577
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:43,096
I think that's safe to say.

578
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:07,720
- Cop a squat.
- What?

579
00:43:07,755 --> 00:43:09,088
Sit down.

580
00:43:09,123 --> 00:43:12,258
Klein: Hey, did Maldonado
really puke at the scene?

581
00:43:12,293 --> 00:43:14,461
Officer: Must have been bad clams.

582
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:16,262
Klein: Were there still
a lot of guys there?

583
00:43:16,297 --> 00:43:19,132
I mean, that's a mess.

584
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:20,400
Just stay still.

585
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:21,968
Klein: West 87th Street.

586
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:23,169
I mean, it's quiet.

587
00:43:23,204 --> 00:43:26,206
Officer: Yeah. All right.

588
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,075
Yeah, Maldonado had us pick up this kid.

589
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:30,643
Cup of coffee, man?

590
00:43:36,754 --> 00:43:39,644
_

591
00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:42,689
Man: Knock, knock.

592
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:44,791
- Hey.
- Watch where you step.

593
00:44:02,076 --> 00:44:03,910
(phone ringing)

594
00:44:05,613 --> 00:44:07,847
Klein.

595
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:10,583
Well, I was doing all right.
Then I answered the phone.

596
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:15,588
How much you give me to check?

597
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:24,731
(phone ringing)

598
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:31,037
I got a Pauline Rodriguez, will that do?

599
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:39,846
Always a pleasure.

600
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,750
(shouting)

601
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:50,823
Tom, hey, weekend or ED?

602
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:52,425
Dustin. Blast from the past.

603
00:44:52,459 --> 00:44:54,928
Dust? Where the hell am
I supposed to park him?

604
00:44:54,962 --> 00:44:57,297
Take his ass to St. Luke's, please.

605
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:58,498
Officer: Let's get him up.

606
00:44:58,532 --> 00:45:00,533
Up. Up.

607
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,001
Fuck you lookin' at?

608
00:45:43,978 --> 00:45:46,379
What can you tell me
about the weapon, Harry?

609
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:48,414
Pretty sure it's one knife.

610
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:51,050
Approximately one and a half inch wide by,

611
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:52,518
I'm gonna say,

612
00:45:52,553 --> 00:45:53,653
five inches long.

613
00:45:53,687 --> 00:45:55,421
Till I get her on the table and probe.

614
00:45:55,456 --> 00:45:56,756
Box: Serrated, or no?

615
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,025
Not sure yet. Possibly.

616
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:10,603
What happened?

617
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:13,373
What, you can't tell me nothing?

618
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:15,008
Or you don't know nothing?

619
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:21,014
Ain't that... That's where
that girl lives, right?

620
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:23,783
I mean, what happened? What'd he
do? What, he kill her or something?

621
00:46:25,586 --> 00:46:27,487
I'm just playing, I'm just playing.

622
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:29,489
But for real, what happened?

623
00:46:30,724 --> 00:46:33,359
You can't give out any information?

624
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,403
Have a seat, sir.

625
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:19,505
Someone will be right with you, all right?

626
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:21,841
Hi, Sergeant.

627
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:22,975
Hey, who's this?

628
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,043
One wit.

629
00:47:24,078 --> 00:47:26,546
Sergeant told me to bring him in.

630
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,617
Klein: All right, looks good. Any problems?

631
00:47:31,652 --> 00:47:33,086
Officer: Nope.

632
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,074
Dad.

633
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:01,180
You all right?

634
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:03,316
Where's Naz?

635
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,284
What?

636
00:48:06,587 --> 00:48:10,189
So, who's "he" in the sentence
"he kill her or something"?

637
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:12,692
Uh, look, man, I was just saying.

638
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:14,193
You were just saying what?

639
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:18,131
I mean, you know, some
Arab dude she was with.

640
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:20,233
Describe him.

641
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:21,601
You know, an Arab dude.

642
00:48:21,635 --> 00:48:23,035
No, I don't.

643
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,505
Look like he work at a deli or some shit.

644
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:27,740
Try harder.

645
00:48:27,775 --> 00:48:31,511
Uh, like, little, short, skinny,

646
00:48:31,545 --> 00:48:33,579
Puerto Rican-looking
motherfucker with beanie eyes.

647
00:48:33,614 --> 00:48:36,849
How do you know he wasn't Puerto
Rican? Was he wearing anything Arabic?

648
00:48:36,884 --> 00:48:38,718
Nah, man, he...

649
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:40,253
He had on his regular, you know,

650
00:48:40,287 --> 00:48:42,054
Friday night, go out and party shit.

651
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:43,589
I mean, I tried to warn her, too.

652
00:48:43,624 --> 00:48:45,625
Yeah? How'd you go about doing that?

653
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:48,027
I just told him right to his face.

654
00:48:48,061 --> 00:48:49,529
But you didn't know him.

655
00:48:49,563 --> 00:48:50,930
Nope.

656
00:48:50,964 --> 00:48:52,832
Never saw him before.

657
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:54,267
Nope, nope.

658
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:55,802
You know the girl?

659
00:48:55,836 --> 00:48:58,571
I mean, not <i>per se,</i>
you know what I'm saying?

660
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:00,339
No, I don't.

661
00:49:00,374 --> 00:49:01,974
I mean, I know her type.

662
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:03,509
What type is that?

663
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,747
You know what, this coming out wrong.

664
00:49:07,781 --> 00:49:09,448
What's your name?

665
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:11,617
How about you give me
your card or something,

666
00:49:11,652 --> 00:49:13,119
and then I just bang you on this later?

667
00:49:13,153 --> 00:49:14,921
My card.

668
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:19,292
If I turn you upside down, how
much weed is gonna fall out?

669
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:22,528
Oh, so that's how you do?

670
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,835
See?

671
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:30,937
No good deed goes unturned.

672
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:32,471
Take him in.

673
00:49:33,707 --> 00:49:34,841
Let's go.

674
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:38,911
Fuck LeBron. He can shit MVPs
out his ass year in, year out.

675
00:49:38,946 --> 00:49:41,180
He's still not gonna be able
to deliver rings like Kobe.

676
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:43,082
Nah, nigga. Kobe ain't got no heart.

677
00:49:43,116 --> 00:49:44,584
Kobe ain't got no team, man.

678
00:49:44,618 --> 00:49:46,853
- Kobe is the team!
- That's the problem.

679
00:49:46,887 --> 00:49:48,654
81 points in one game, didn't he score?

680
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:49,822
- He a overachiever.
- That's some...

681
00:49:49,857 --> 00:49:51,991
You got a fucking problem
you ain't passing the ball.

682
00:49:52,025 --> 00:49:53,025
Nigga was triple-teamed.

683
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,794
- Look, why would he want to...
- Triple-teamed and...

684
00:49:54,828 --> 00:49:56,696
- Why would he pass the ball if he...
- (phone buzzing)

685
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,332
I roll with winners, homeboy.
I don't know about you.

686
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:01,367
No, man, he good, he good. He great.

687
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:02,869
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

688
00:50:02,903 --> 00:50:05,104
But LeBron James... LeBron James,

689
00:50:05,138 --> 00:50:08,007
look, he got a good two
inches on Kobe heightwise,

690
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,709
and like three...

691
00:50:09,743 --> 00:50:11,444
- You know... 30 pounds.
- How long was LeBron...

692
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:13,846
- How long was LeBron with them boys in Cleveland?
- Come on.

693
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:15,214
What, like six years.

694
00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:18,551
What did he win for them?
What did he win for them?

695
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:23,956
(phone ringing)

696
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:32,598
Who the hell is this?

697
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:34,934
This is Nasir's father, Amir.

698
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:37,570
Mr. Khan?

699
00:50:37,604 --> 00:50:38,971
Is he with you?

700
00:50:39,006 --> 00:50:40,172
Amir: No, sir.

701
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:41,607
Do you know where he is?

702
00:50:41,642 --> 00:50:43,442
No. I haven't seen him.

703
00:50:43,477 --> 00:50:47,146
No, but he said you were
going out together tonight.

704
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,350
Yeah, we were supposed to go
to a party, but I didn't go.

705
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:52,952
So, where was this party?

706
00:50:52,986 --> 00:50:54,587
(speaking Urdu)

707
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:58,224
Amir: I have no idea. I
don't have the address on me.

708
00:51:28,722 --> 00:51:31,257
Box: I don't know what you're doing here.

709
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:34,160
I have witnesses to interview, do you?

710
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:35,094
Go back out there.

711
00:51:35,128 --> 00:51:37,596
Sarge, we got 10,000
gold shields on the scene.

712
00:51:37,631 --> 00:51:40,066
- What do you need us out there for?
- It's called chain of custody.

713
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,468
Didn't you go to the
academy like the other kids?

714
00:51:42,502 --> 00:51:44,603
And when you log it all, remember,

715
00:51:44,638 --> 00:51:46,439
blood stays with blood, hair with hair,

716
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:48,975
photos with photos.

717
00:51:49,009 --> 00:51:50,609
Can I ask you guys something?

718
00:51:50,644 --> 00:51:53,779
Who's my friend over there who's been
staring at me like Bambi last two hours?

719
00:51:53,814 --> 00:51:56,215
Maldonado: Ah, shit, he's ours.

720
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:57,850
You, sir.

721
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:01,654
What is he, DWI? What'd he blow?

722
00:52:01,688 --> 00:52:03,456
He was supposed to get tested in the house.

723
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,790
He didn't... I mean, you didn't?

724
00:52:04,825 --> 00:52:05,958
What, get the memo?

725
00:52:05,993 --> 00:52:08,194
- Who'd we tell to test?
- We told what's-his-name.

726
00:52:08,228 --> 00:52:09,295
Klein:
What's-his-name.

727
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:10,763
What's the matter, you
guys don't like overtime?

728
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:13,399
- Who doesn't like overtime?
- You want, I'll test him right now.

729
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:14,400
Now you're gonna test him.

730
00:52:14,434 --> 00:52:16,569
Test what? It's gone, if it was ever there.

731
00:52:16,603 --> 00:52:18,037
Just dodged a bullet here, kid.

732
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:20,940
Get his pedigree, search him, clear
him of warrants, and kick him free.

733
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:22,842
Put your hands on the railing for me.

734
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:25,578
Box: Be careful with
the inventory vouchers.

735
00:52:25,612 --> 00:52:28,781
Klein: DCPI called, I'm like,
totally in the dark here.

736
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:31,150
- Can you help me out?
- I'll do my best, Teddy.

737
00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:32,518
Uh, name?

738
00:52:32,552 --> 00:52:34,086
Nasir Khan.

739
00:52:34,121 --> 00:52:35,988
Victim's name is Andrea Cornish.

740
00:52:36,023 --> 00:52:37,356
Spell it.

741
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:38,824
22 years old.

742
00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:40,426
N-a-s-i-r.

743
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,461
- K-h-a-n.
- Caucasian.

744
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:43,929
Found in a bedroom,

745
00:52:43,964 --> 00:52:45,464
in bed.

746
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,666
- DOB?
- Stabbing homicide.

747
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:50,603
- Um, 11/12/90.
- Suspect is a male.

748
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:53,105
Unknown age, unknown race.

749
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,607
This your current address?

750
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:56,542
- Yeah.
- Seen leaving at approximately 0200

751
00:52:56,576 --> 00:52:59,111
running down the block hailing a taxi.

752
00:52:59,146 --> 00:53:01,313
Witness: I didn't say
that he hailed a taxi.

753
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:03,682
I said that he left in a taxi.

754
00:53:03,717 --> 00:53:04,950
That's what I said.

755
00:53:04,985 --> 00:53:06,786
His taxi.

756
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:10,056
Fine.

757
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,391
Is this what we do?
Dump our witnesses here?

758
00:53:12,426 --> 00:53:14,693
Somebody escort the
gentleman to the squad room.

759
00:53:14,728 --> 00:53:16,429
Uh, Frank, do you mind?

760
00:53:16,463 --> 00:53:18,564
Frank: Come with me, sir.

761
00:53:18,598 --> 00:53:20,433
Race, what are you?

762
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,734
Uh, Pakistani.

763
00:53:21,768 --> 00:53:23,335
Asian Pacific or other.

764
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:25,671
- Who's the other guy?
- What other guy?

765
00:53:25,705 --> 00:53:27,907
I was talking to who I said bring in.

766
00:53:27,941 --> 00:53:29,075
The one reeking weed.

767
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:30,843
Maldonado: Who'd we tell?

768
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:31,844
Cass: Bell.

769
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:33,946
Nope. Brought him in.

770
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,548
Klein: How many times stabbed?

771
00:53:35,582 --> 00:53:37,149
Box: I didn't count, Teddy.

772
00:53:37,184 --> 00:53:39,151
- A lot.
- Maldonado: Occupation?

773
00:53:39,186 --> 00:53:40,186
Student.

774
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:42,555
- Get it from Harry.
- Where?

775
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:45,324
Please put your hands behind your
head for me, please, lock your fingers.

776
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:46,926
- Where?
- Hudson College.

777
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,327
Turn around.

778
00:53:51,164 --> 00:53:53,065
Klein: Weapon recovered?

779
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,834
Box: Not as yet.

780
00:53:54,868 --> 00:53:57,169
ESU's doing a toss of the house,

781
00:53:57,204 --> 00:53:59,939
street, dumpsters, grates, drains.

782
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:03,342
What we're looking for is an
approximately five-inch-long,

783
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:06,312
one-and-a-half-inch-wide,
possibly serrated...

784
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:11,150
knife.

785
00:54:13,453 --> 00:54:14,920
Maldonado: Turn around.

786
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:18,991
Do not move.

787
00:54:19,025 --> 00:54:20,593
You picked him up where, again?

788
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:21,961
65th and Broadway.

789
00:54:21,995 --> 00:54:23,963
- No, wait, wait.
- What time?

790
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:25,197
About 0200.

791
00:54:25,232 --> 00:54:26,265
I didn't do it.

792
00:54:26,299 --> 00:54:27,766
Didn't do what?

793
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:31,470
What's your name, son?

794
00:54:33,473 --> 00:54:35,841
Nasir. You don't understand.

795
00:54:35,876 --> 00:54:38,277
That's why we're gonna talk, okay?

796
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:39,512
So I will understand.

797
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:41,480
Just you and me.

798
00:54:41,515 --> 00:54:42,715
Come over here.

799
00:54:42,749 --> 00:54:44,316
- Come on. Come on.
- Please, let go of me.

800
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:45,818
No, no!

801
00:54:45,852 --> 00:54:47,019
I didn't do anything!

802
00:54:47,053 --> 00:54:49,622
- I didn't do anything!
- Put your hands behind your back!

803
00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:51,090
Give me your arm!

804
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:53,325
(shouting)

805
00:54:55,395 --> 00:54:57,129
Hey, hey, man,

806
00:54:57,164 --> 00:54:59,598
that's the dude I was talking
about. That's him, right there.

807
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:01,500
Yeah. Hey, that's him.

808
00:55:01,535 --> 00:55:02,835
Aah!

809
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:04,236
No!

810
00:55:04,271 --> 00:55:06,438
(phone buzzing) _

811
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:09,308
Naz: Argh! No! No!

812
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:11,243
I didn't do anything!

813
00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:17,416
Should we call the police?

814
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:18,717
No.

815
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:38,103
Bell: Remember what he said in the car?

816
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,574
"Is she dead?"

817
00:55:53,753 --> 00:55:56,522
(door opens)

818
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:11,470
We didn't, uh, formally meet out there.

819
00:56:11,504 --> 00:56:14,139
I'm Detective Sergeant Dennis Box.

820
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:18,444
So, Nasir.

821
00:56:18,478 --> 00:56:20,613
Is that what you like to be called, or?

822
00:56:20,647 --> 00:56:21,580
Naz.

823
00:56:21,615 --> 00:56:25,284
Naz. Okay. That's easy.

824
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,555
So, Naz, what happened tonight?

825
00:56:32,192 --> 00:56:34,760
Did you know Andrea well, or just meet her?

826
00:56:37,097 --> 00:56:39,231
Just someone who got in your cab?

827
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,568
My dad's cab.

828
00:56:42,602 --> 00:56:44,570
Your dad's cab, all right.

829
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,474
You picked her up in the cab.

830
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:50,843
Where?

831
00:56:53,813 --> 00:56:55,347
Naz...

832
00:56:56,483 --> 00:56:58,350
I don't know. Downtown somewhere.

833
00:56:58,385 --> 00:56:59,985
I was lost. I don't know.

834
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,455
Okay. Then?

835
00:57:05,558 --> 00:57:07,526
Where did she say she wanted to go?

836
00:57:12,399 --> 00:57:14,300
The beach.

837
00:57:14,334 --> 00:57:16,068
The what?

838
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:18,037
The beach.

839
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:19,438
The beach?

840
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:25,744
She say something, or...

841
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:28,881
do something or behave
in some way to upset you?

842
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,417
No.

843
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:32,885
She must have said something.

844
00:57:32,919 --> 00:57:34,553
No.

845
00:57:34,587 --> 00:57:37,423
Naz, you said out there
I didn't understand.

846
00:57:37,457 --> 00:57:38,424
And you're right, I don't.

847
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:41,493
That's what I'm trying to do here. I'm...

848
00:57:41,528 --> 00:57:44,063
It's why I'm here.

849
00:57:44,097 --> 00:57:46,398
To try to understand. To hear it from you.

850
00:57:46,433 --> 00:57:48,100
I don't have to do that, by the way.

851
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:50,769
I want to.

852
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:54,573
What you need to understand is what
you say to me here is very important.

853
00:57:54,607 --> 00:57:56,175
For you, not me.

854
00:57:56,209 --> 00:57:57,576
It can help you.

855
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,812
I'm trying to help you. Help me help you.

856
00:57:59,846 --> 00:58:02,715
(gasping)

857
00:58:02,749 --> 00:58:04,883
I can't breathe.

858
00:58:04,918 --> 00:58:06,018
Okay.

859
00:58:06,052 --> 00:58:08,253
That's okay, not uncommon. Just relax.

860
00:58:08,288 --> 00:58:09,455
No, I mean, I have asthma.

861
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:12,224
Oh. You got something
to help you with that?

862
00:58:12,258 --> 00:58:14,159
No.

863
00:58:14,194 --> 00:58:15,928
You wanna go to the hospital?

864
00:58:17,597 --> 00:58:19,164
I wanna go home.

865
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,034
You still on hold?

866
00:58:22,068 --> 00:58:23,569
Yes, I am.

867
00:58:23,603 --> 00:58:25,738
Where is this hospital?

868
00:58:25,772 --> 00:58:27,306
It's here, where do you think?

869
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,508
Didn't he say he was going into Manhattan?

870
00:58:36,983 --> 00:58:39,585
"Is she dead?"

871
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:41,086
What?

872
00:58:41,121 --> 00:58:44,523
That's what you asked the officers
in the car that brought you here.

873
00:58:44,557 --> 00:58:46,792
"Is she dead?"

874
00:58:46,826 --> 00:58:48,827
You don't remember saying that?

875
00:58:50,263 --> 00:58:53,098
They hadn't said anything
about her. Hadn't...

876
00:58:53,133 --> 00:58:55,100
said it was a she or a he,

877
00:58:55,135 --> 00:58:57,302
let alone dead, nobody had.

878
00:58:59,906 --> 00:59:03,475
So, you were at her place.
Can we agree on that?

879
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,377
You have a couple drinks.

880
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:06,645
Maybe a kiss.

881
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:08,414
You have a couple more drinks and...

882
00:59:09,382 --> 00:59:11,917
And she's pretty, I know that. I saw her.

883
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:13,552
What'd she do, say no?

884
00:59:13,586 --> 00:59:14,720
No.

885
00:59:14,754 --> 00:59:17,122
- Fought you?
- No.

886
00:59:17,157 --> 00:59:19,057
Then what happened, Naz?

887
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,296
I don't know. I fell asleep.

888
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:26,398
When I woke up,

889
00:59:26,433 --> 00:59:28,267
and she was like that...

890
00:59:28,301 --> 00:59:29,768
She was dead.

891
00:59:29,803 --> 00:59:31,770
And you, what did you do?

892
00:59:34,207 --> 00:59:36,074
I ran.

893
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:38,243
'Cause I was scared.

894
00:59:38,278 --> 00:59:39,578
By what you'd done.

895
00:59:39,612 --> 00:59:41,280
No.

896
00:59:45,452 --> 00:59:48,020
What we're gonna do when we're done here,

897
00:59:48,054 --> 00:59:50,422
just so you know, is run some tests.

898
00:59:50,457 --> 00:59:52,524
You know why?

899
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,460
Because you're a crime scene, Nasir.

900
00:59:54,494 --> 00:59:56,462
Just like the house,
and the cab, and Andrea.

901
00:59:56,496 --> 01:00:00,699
And it's our job to collect
everything we can from a crime scene.

902
01:00:00,733 --> 01:00:03,335
And here's what we're
gonna find, if you ask me.

903
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:05,537
Her in the cab, the cab on her,

904
01:00:05,572 --> 01:00:07,940
you in the house, the house on you,

905
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:09,575
you on her, her on you,

906
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:11,443
the knife on you, her on the knife.

907
01:00:11,478 --> 01:00:13,011
I didn't kill her.

908
01:00:13,046 --> 01:00:15,147
You had sex with her.

909
01:00:16,683 --> 01:00:19,284
Yes. But it wasn't...

910
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,254
I didn't force her.

911
01:00:22,288 --> 01:00:23,489
I didn't say you did.

912
01:00:23,523 --> 01:00:26,024
She's only the second girl
I've ever slept with in my life.

913
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:27,793
I liked her.

914
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:32,731
She was nice.

915
01:00:32,765 --> 01:00:34,633
Look, I'm gonna be straight with you, Naz.

916
01:00:34,667 --> 01:00:36,502
Because what I'm looking at,

917
01:00:36,536 --> 01:00:39,805
the evidence already, the
eyewitnesses are so strong...

918
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,841
you really need to start telling
me the truth for your sake.

919
01:00:42,876 --> 01:00:44,910
I am.

920
01:00:46,045 --> 01:00:47,546
You see that, right?

921
01:00:50,049 --> 01:00:51,583
That's recording us.

922
01:00:51,618 --> 01:00:53,185
And it will be used in court.

923
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:55,087
How you think that's gonna come off?

924
01:00:55,121 --> 01:00:56,755
"She was nice, I liked her.

925
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:58,123
But I killed her anyway."

926
01:00:58,157 --> 01:01:00,058
I didn't. I already told you, I...

927
01:01:01,361 --> 01:01:03,161
I can't remember.

928
01:01:03,196 --> 01:01:06,231
I have to tell you, that's
not gonna play any better.

929
01:01:06,266 --> 01:01:08,100
Judges and juries...

930
01:01:08,134 --> 01:01:10,068
they don't like "I can't remember."

931
01:01:10,103 --> 01:01:12,471
They like honesty. They like remorse.

932
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:13,906
They like that a lot.

933
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,074
That counts for something to them.

934
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:18,510
And even more to you.

935
01:01:18,545 --> 01:01:20,245
I'm talking about years.

936
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,848
Honesty and remorse can
shave a lot of years off.

937
01:01:22,882 --> 01:01:25,918
So, you may want to revise that.

938
01:01:27,387 --> 01:01:29,121
Now's the time.

939
01:01:36,262 --> 01:01:37,529
All right.

940
01:01:37,564 --> 01:01:39,031
Let's go do what we have to do.

941
01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:40,866
We can talk again later.

942
01:01:48,608 --> 01:01:49,975
Come on.

943
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:58,383
Take your clothes off.

944
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:23,508
- What's...
- Shut the fuck up and take your shirt off.

945
01:02:41,327 --> 01:02:43,195
Don't look at me. Take your pants off.

946
01:03:22,735 --> 01:03:24,569
Sorry about that.

947
01:03:26,606 --> 01:03:29,808
Here. Put these on.

948
01:03:35,181 --> 01:03:36,648
Thank you.

949
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,540
Hello?

950
01:04:01,574 --> 01:04:04,776
How long do I have to be
in here? I got things to do.

951
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,551
No, that's okay.

952
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:16,254
Would you hang on a second, please?

953
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:19,791
- Gentlemen, how's the scene?
- It's the Battle of Gettysburg.

954
01:04:19,826 --> 01:04:21,560
We'll be there all day.
Where's the birthday boy?

955
01:04:21,594 --> 01:04:23,361
- Upstairs.
- Thanks.

956
01:04:23,396 --> 01:04:26,298
Klein: Can you spell your name for me?

957
01:04:26,332 --> 01:04:27,733
Hey, yo, excuse me, miss?

958
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:29,434
Hey, yo, can I call my moms?

959
01:04:29,469 --> 01:04:30,769
Go, go, come on.

960
01:04:30,803 --> 01:04:33,405
All right, I'll have one of our
detectives get in touch with you.

961
01:04:33,439 --> 01:04:35,574
Man: Turn to your left.

962
01:04:35,608 --> 01:04:36,875
Turn to the other side.

963
01:04:36,909 --> 01:04:38,176
Take your shirt off.

964
01:04:38,211 --> 01:04:41,046
Officer: Make sure you get some
close-ups on those back scratches.

965
01:04:42,682 --> 01:04:44,082
Get a shot of that.

966
01:04:45,651 --> 01:04:47,119
Put your arms up.

967
01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:51,556
All right, put your hand here.

968
01:04:53,192 --> 01:04:54,559
Turn it over.

969
01:04:54,594 --> 01:04:57,429
Let's get a close-up. Thank you.

970
01:04:59,532 --> 01:05:02,367
Box: I'd like to get a little
swab of the blood on your hands.

971
01:05:02,401 --> 01:05:04,269
A little swipe under the nails.

972
01:05:04,303 --> 01:05:05,904
A little bit off the
scratches on your back.

973
01:05:05,938 --> 01:05:08,907
And inside your cheek. Okay if I do that?

974
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:10,742
I don't know. Is it?

975
01:05:10,777 --> 01:05:12,344
I need your consent, Naz.

976
01:05:12,378 --> 01:05:14,713
If you don't give it, then
I have to get a court order.

977
01:05:14,747 --> 01:05:16,481
And that will take about 45 minutes.

978
01:05:16,516 --> 01:05:18,517
So, it's not a problem.

979
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:19,885
Except for you.

980
01:05:19,919 --> 01:05:21,653
Refusing looks bad to a jury.

981
01:05:21,687 --> 01:05:23,255
And I really don't want you disadvantaged.

982
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:25,357
But it's up to you.

983
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:26,792
You can say no.

984
01:05:28,761 --> 01:05:30,228
I didn't do it.

985
01:05:30,263 --> 01:05:31,363
Well, there you have it.

986
01:05:31,397 --> 01:05:33,031
You got nothing to fear, so,

987
01:05:33,065 --> 01:05:34,432
shall we go ahead and do it then?

988
01:05:34,467 --> 01:05:36,201
Your call.

989
01:05:38,571 --> 01:05:40,472
Say the words for me, Naz.

990
01:05:40,506 --> 01:05:41,807
Yes.

991
01:05:52,718 --> 01:05:54,219
Open your mouth.

992
01:06:00,827 --> 01:06:02,494
Oh, one more thing.

993
01:06:02,528 --> 01:06:04,629
I'm gonna need a penile swab, too.

994
01:06:04,664 --> 01:06:06,965
Is it okay if we do that next?

995
01:06:08,501 --> 01:06:09,901
Yes?

996
01:06:11,103 --> 01:06:12,470
Okay.

997
01:06:19,745 --> 01:06:20,912
You want me to stay?

998
01:06:22,415 --> 01:06:23,748
Will it hurt?

999
01:06:24,984 --> 01:06:26,351
No.

1000
01:06:26,385 --> 01:06:28,019
Stand up.

1001
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:32,724
Drop your pants.

1002
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:50,709
That's good, good.

1003
01:06:52,578 --> 01:06:54,546
Just... just relax.

1004
01:07:00,152 --> 01:07:02,053
CSU: I think we're about done here?

1005
01:07:02,088 --> 01:07:04,155
CSU 2: Box wanted palms and tips, too.

1006
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,958
- I didn't hear him say that.
- Then don't do it.

1007
01:07:06,993 --> 01:07:08,960
All right, try not to shake too much.

1008
01:07:20,273 --> 01:07:22,340
I want a lawyer.

1009
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,209
CSU 2: Oh, yeah, why?

1010
01:07:24,243 --> 01:07:26,111
What do you mean, why?

1011
01:07:26,145 --> 01:07:28,246
You know what kind of message that sends?

1012
01:07:28,281 --> 01:07:31,049
Hey, what do we know. We're
just crime scene unit guys.

1013
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:33,652
So, why don't you wait till
the squad detectives come back,

1014
01:07:33,686 --> 01:07:35,420
and get into all that with them.

1015
01:07:35,454 --> 01:07:38,456
Seriously though, kid, look
before you leap, is what I say.

1016
01:07:38,491 --> 01:07:40,458
Okay. We're done here.

1017
01:07:42,995 --> 01:07:44,296
Wipe up.

1018
01:07:50,269 --> 01:07:51,603
Man: Here's my card.

1019
01:07:51,637 --> 01:07:54,806
250 bucks. I'll meet you there.

1020
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,308
You'll be okay.

1021
01:07:56,342 --> 01:07:58,777
Will you take a check?

1022
01:07:58,811 --> 01:08:00,545
- For you, Paul?
- Pauline.

1023
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:03,248
Pauline, I'm sorry.

1024
01:08:03,282 --> 01:08:05,951
A cashier's check's okay.

1025
01:08:31,811 --> 01:08:34,980
Hey, what's with Gunga Din in there?

1026
01:08:35,014 --> 01:08:37,248
- Who?
- The big-eyed kid.

1027
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:39,684
- The kid?
- Yeah, in the pen.

1028
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:41,019
Oh, him.

1029
01:08:41,053 --> 01:08:43,021
He cut a girl on 87th Street.

1030
01:08:43,055 --> 01:08:45,490
Who did?

1031
01:08:45,524 --> 01:08:50,061
They're called razors, Jack,
you should invest. Experiment.

1032
01:08:50,096 --> 01:08:52,864
Worse comes to worst, it all grows back.

1033
01:09:19,825 --> 01:09:21,126
All right, my man.

1034
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,762
All we need now is the
knife and clothes and shoes.

1035
01:09:23,796 --> 01:09:26,064
I sent all that over before you got here.

1036
01:09:26,098 --> 01:09:27,232
Who did?

1037
01:09:27,266 --> 01:09:28,700
Two of my unis drove it over.

1038
01:09:29,702 --> 01:09:31,403
You always break chain
of evidence like that?

1039
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:34,105
Relax. It's all there, neat and tidy.

1040
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,441
Here's a voucher.

1041
01:09:36,475 --> 01:09:38,910
- They handed it to Mathis?
- He's their dispatcher?

1042
01:09:38,944 --> 01:09:42,147
Apparently with the Battle of Gettysburg
and all, he was the only one there.

1043
01:09:42,181 --> 01:09:44,182
Hey, nobody told me you were coming here.

1044
01:09:44,216 --> 01:09:46,751
Yet here we are.

1045
01:09:46,786 --> 01:09:49,287
Klein: Thought I was doing you
guys a favor. The fuck do I know?

1046
01:09:49,321 --> 01:09:51,056
Next time, wait for us.

1047
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:52,924
Next time, call first.

1048
01:09:57,997 --> 01:09:59,297
What are you doing?

1049
01:09:59,331 --> 01:10:01,232
I'm here to see my client.

1050
01:10:01,267 --> 01:10:04,035
- You just did.
- Not him... her.

1051
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:05,403
Him.

1052
01:10:19,452 --> 01:10:22,620
Your man is here, as it were,

1053
01:10:22,655 --> 01:10:24,255
Johnny the Red.

1054
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:26,224
Bye now.

1055
01:10:27,793 --> 01:10:30,095
Jack: And don't lose that key!

1056
01:10:30,129 --> 01:10:32,831
25 years, the Berlin Wall comes down,

1057
01:10:32,865 --> 01:10:37,235
and this throwback's still
going on about communists.

1058
01:10:37,269 --> 01:10:40,605
So, Nazir... Nasir.

1059
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,874
Is that what I call you or...

1060
01:10:42,908 --> 01:10:44,709
- Naz.
- You're a citizen, Naz?

1061
01:10:44,743 --> 01:10:45,710
What... who are you?

1062
01:10:45,744 --> 01:10:48,012
Your lawyer. You a U.S. citizen?

1063
01:10:48,047 --> 01:10:49,447
- You're like, a public defender?
- No.

1064
01:10:49,482 --> 01:10:50,715
You're a citizen?

1065
01:10:50,749 --> 01:10:51,716
Yeah.

1066
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,351
Guess number one:

1067
01:10:53,385 --> 01:10:55,253
Pakistani by blood?

1068
01:10:55,287 --> 01:10:56,788
- Yeah, my mom.
- What is she?

1069
01:10:56,822 --> 01:10:59,390
Punjabi, Pashtun, Baluch?

1070
01:10:59,425 --> 01:11:01,126
Punjabi.

1071
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,061
- You been to Pakistan?
- No.

1072
01:11:03,095 --> 01:11:04,696
Have you?

1073
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:05,864
No.

1074
01:11:09,001 --> 01:11:10,335
It's eczema.

1075
01:11:10,369 --> 01:11:12,170
Dermatologist says to keep them aerated.

1076
01:11:12,204 --> 01:11:13,905
Like that's gonna cure anything.

1077
01:11:13,939 --> 01:11:16,141
I don't know, maybe it
helps. I really can't tell.

1078
01:11:16,175 --> 01:11:17,709
You ever been arrested?

1079
01:11:17,743 --> 01:11:18,610
No.

1080
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:21,246
- Pissing in public, littering, anything?
- No.

1081
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,449
Well, first time for everything, right?

1082
01:11:25,584 --> 01:11:27,018
Don't worry about my feet.

1083
01:11:27,052 --> 01:11:28,386
It's not contagious.

1084
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:29,587
How's your politics?

1085
01:11:29,622 --> 01:11:30,755
What do you mean, my politics?

1086
01:11:30,789 --> 01:11:32,557
Well, not to sound like a tea-bagger,

1087
01:11:32,591 --> 01:11:34,759
but how do you feel about America?

1088
01:11:34,793 --> 01:11:37,228
Well, I'm American. I was born here.

1089
01:11:37,263 --> 01:11:40,265
Name two Yankees headed
for the Hall of Fame?

1090
01:11:40,299 --> 01:11:41,866
- Why?
- One Mississippi...

1091
01:11:41,901 --> 01:11:43,101
Rivera and Jeter.

1092
01:11:43,135 --> 01:11:45,036
Good.

1093
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,204
Married?

1094
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:48,039
No.

1095
01:11:48,073 --> 01:11:51,242
So, as a good Muslim boy,
you live with your parents?

1096
01:11:51,277 --> 01:11:52,243
Yeah.

1097
01:11:52,278 --> 01:11:53,478
Talk to them yet?

1098
01:11:53,512 --> 01:11:54,579
They took my phone.

1099
01:11:54,613 --> 01:11:55,647
Talk to anyone?

1100
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:56,915
N... What do you mean?

1101
01:11:56,949 --> 01:11:58,750
- Here.
- Like, who?

1102
01:11:58,784 --> 01:12:01,553
It's not a tough question.
Like cops, who else is there?

1103
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:03,221
Uh, I talked to one.

1104
01:12:03,255 --> 01:12:04,889
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

1105
01:12:04,924 --> 01:12:07,659
Tell me he told you you had to?

1106
01:12:07,693 --> 01:12:09,527
He didn't.

1107
01:12:09,562 --> 01:12:11,829
Tell me he didn't read you your rights?

1108
01:12:11,864 --> 01:12:14,232
They did.

1109
01:12:18,704 --> 01:12:20,371
I may need you to come down again.

1110
01:12:20,406 --> 01:12:22,874
So, don't like, run off to
Europe without telling me.

1111
01:12:22,908 --> 01:12:27,212
Do I look like someone running
off to Europe anytime soon?

1112
01:12:27,246 --> 01:12:29,280
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1113
01:12:29,315 --> 01:12:31,783
You may go home and get some sleep now.

1114
01:12:38,724 --> 01:12:39,991
Almost done?

1115
01:12:40,025 --> 01:12:41,259
Yeah. You?

1116
01:12:41,293 --> 01:12:42,727
Yeah.

1117
01:12:42,761 --> 01:12:44,896
- Let's get out of here before they...
- (door opens)

1118
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:46,264
Don't look up.

1119
01:12:48,634 --> 01:12:50,702
Hit print, let's go.

1120
01:12:50,736 --> 01:12:52,403
You two were first on the scene, right?

1121
01:12:52,438 --> 01:12:54,439
Yeah. Just finished the DD-5s.

1122
01:12:54,473 --> 01:12:56,207
Everything's done. We're going home.

1123
01:12:57,176 --> 01:12:58,509
Upstairs.

1124
01:12:58,544 --> 01:13:01,746
Sir, we were supposed to
be off like five hours ago.

1125
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:03,848
- Really?
- Yeah.

1126
01:13:03,882 --> 01:13:06,050
- So...
- So come upstairs.

1127
01:13:12,925 --> 01:13:14,692
This was when?

1128
01:13:14,727 --> 01:13:17,161
I don't know, what time is it now, 4:00?

1129
01:13:17,196 --> 01:13:18,363
6:00.

1130
01:13:18,397 --> 01:13:20,798
6:00! What time am I getting out of here?

1131
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:24,068
Never, if you keep answering
questions with questions.

1132
01:13:27,006 --> 01:13:28,573
What was the question again?

1133
01:13:28,607 --> 01:13:30,808
What time it was when you saw them,

1134
01:13:30,843 --> 01:13:33,378
as you put it, rubbing
up against each other?

1135
01:13:33,412 --> 01:13:35,780
- (watch ticking)
- I wanna say...

1136
01:13:35,814 --> 01:13:37,615
10:00, 11:00, something like that.

1137
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,083
You were alone?

1138
01:13:40,152 --> 01:13:41,619
Yeah.

1139
01:13:41,654 --> 01:13:42,787
Doing what?

1140
01:13:42,821 --> 01:13:44,055
Just walking.

1141
01:13:44,089 --> 01:13:47,358
On West 87th Street a block from the park?

1142
01:13:47,393 --> 01:13:49,627
The fuck is that supposed to mean?

1143
01:13:54,133 --> 01:13:55,466
Is this her?

1144
01:13:56,969 --> 01:13:58,603
Yeah, that's her.

1145
01:14:00,372 --> 01:14:01,606
Is he on this?

1146
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,375
I just told you that was
him out there on the floor,

1147
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,844
like, hours ago. What
more do you want from me?

1148
01:14:06,879 --> 01:14:08,346
I want you to look at it,

1149
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,448
and tell me if he's on it or not.

1150
01:14:17,122 --> 01:14:20,091
This towelhead right here.

1151
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:22,193
Just the number, not the op-ed.

1152
01:14:22,227 --> 01:14:24,862
Four. Number four.

1153
01:14:24,897 --> 01:14:26,864
Initial it for me.

1154
01:14:35,107 --> 01:14:36,374
Thank you, Trevor.

1155
01:14:40,312 --> 01:14:42,880
Okay, Naz, listen to me,

1156
01:14:42,915 --> 01:14:45,183
don't talk to anybody anymore.

1157
01:14:45,217 --> 01:14:47,318
Anyone asks you anything, how you doing,

1158
01:14:47,353 --> 01:14:48,553
isn't it a nice day?

1159
01:14:48,587 --> 01:14:49,787
You say, "Gee, I don't know.

1160
01:14:49,822 --> 01:14:52,790
Talk to my lawyer." Okay? Say it.

1161
01:14:52,825 --> 01:14:55,059
- Okay.
- No, no, say that to me.

1162
01:14:55,094 --> 01:14:56,160
I don't know...

1163
01:14:56,195 --> 01:14:57,462
- I don't know.
- Talk to...

1164
01:14:57,496 --> 01:14:58,663
Talk to my lawyer.

1165
01:14:58,697 --> 01:15:01,332
Good. I've been an "I
don't know" guy all my life.

1166
01:15:01,367 --> 01:15:03,901
It's never let me down.

1167
01:15:03,936 --> 01:15:05,036
Where are you going?

1168
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:07,572
To see if I can get you
out of here. Short of that,

1169
01:15:07,606 --> 01:15:09,040
get your phone call.

1170
01:15:10,676 --> 01:15:12,110
You know what they're saying I did?

1171
01:15:12,144 --> 01:15:13,911
I don't. And I don't care.

1172
01:15:13,946 --> 01:15:16,414
Until they charge you,
you didn't do anything.

1173
01:15:17,783 --> 01:15:19,283
Guard!

1174
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:26,591
Don't go anywhere.

1175
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:27,892
Thanks, Wayne.

1176
01:15:30,429 --> 01:15:32,163
You know what I wonder?

1177
01:15:32,197 --> 01:15:33,831
Where'd it all go wrong?

1178
01:15:33,866 --> 01:15:36,501
The cop who first built
one of these counters,

1179
01:15:36,535 --> 01:15:38,403
how tall you think he was?

1180
01:15:41,473 --> 01:15:43,474
I want to take the kid out of here.

1181
01:15:43,509 --> 01:15:44,475
No shit.

1182
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:45,777
Is he being charged?

1183
01:15:45,811 --> 01:15:47,779
- Oh, yeah.
- With?

1184
01:15:47,813 --> 01:15:49,447
Possession of a weapon, for now.

1185
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:52,250
Misdemeanor desk appearance.
Let's get him to a judge.

1186
01:15:52,284 --> 01:15:55,253
Not gonna happen. They like him
for this 87th Street thing big time.

1187
01:15:55,287 --> 01:15:56,554
Who's they?

1188
01:15:56,588 --> 01:15:57,622
Box.

1189
01:15:57,656 --> 01:15:59,924
The fuck's he got to do with it?

1190
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,225
What do you think?

1191
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,628
Lieberman said he cut a girl.

1192
01:16:03,662 --> 01:16:05,563
"Cut" is right.

1193
01:16:07,332 --> 01:16:10,101
- She's dead?
- Uh-huh.

1194
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:13,738
And it's Box?

1195
01:16:13,772 --> 01:16:15,640
Uh-huh.

1196
01:16:15,674 --> 01:16:16,974
Fuck.

1197
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:27,852
(phone ringing)

1198
01:16:29,087 --> 01:16:30,121
Naz?

1199
01:16:31,223 --> 01:16:34,258
Listen, I'm at a police station.

1200
01:16:34,293 --> 01:16:36,661
And it... it's all a mistake.

1201
01:16:36,695 --> 01:16:39,564
They've arrested me. They
think I did something.

1202
01:16:44,603 --> 01:16:46,237
Murder.

1203
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:53,444
Is he hurt?

1204
01:16:53,479 --> 01:16:56,914
