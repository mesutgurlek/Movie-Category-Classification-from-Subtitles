Louis, you don't have to say anything.

963
02:24:34,624 --> 02:24:36,625
I meant to.

964
02:24:37,753 --> 02:24:38,794
I'm sorry.

965
02:24:40,922 --> 02:24:42,048
I know.

966
02:24:46,595 --> 02:24:48,262
You'll be killed.

967
02:24:48,430 --> 02:24:49,847
You know that?

968
02:24:50,932 --> 02:24:51,932
Maybe.

969
02:24:53,226 --> 02:24:54,977
Please don't do it.

970
02:27:38,683 --> 02:27:43,270
Hey, you bastards, I'm still here.

971

NARRATOR:
Papillon made it to freedom...

972
02:27:58,286 --> 02:28:03,457
...and for the remaining years of his life,
he lived a free man.

973
02:28:04,751 --> 02:28:08,629
This, the infamous penal system
in French Guiana...

974
02:28:08,797 --> 02:28:11,090
...did not survive him.

975
02:30:40,615 --> 02:30:42,616
