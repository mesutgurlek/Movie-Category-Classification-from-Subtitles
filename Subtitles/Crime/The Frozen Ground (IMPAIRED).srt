00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:44,837
IT STARTED A HALF HOUR AGO.
SHE RAN IN SCREAMING,
GOING NUTS.

2
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,673
- MA'AM, OPEN THIS DOOR!
- SHE WOKE THE WHOLE
DAMNED PLACE UP.

00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:50,609
<i>- Man: SHUT THE FUCK UP, BITCH!

<i>- { police radio chatter }

<i>HE'S GONNA KILL ME!

8
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:04,389
MA'AM, ARE YOU ALONE
IN THIS ROOM?

9
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,658
I DIDN'T DO NOTHIN'!
I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T!

10
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,794

PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!

11
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,230
I CAN'T GET THESE OFF.

12
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:13,532
GET THESE FUCKING THINGS
OFF MY HANDS!

13

00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:24,877
PLEASE GET THEM OFF!
{ sobs }

17
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,679
IT'S OKAY.  IT'S OKAY.

18
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,649
IT'S OKAY.
SHHH.

19
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,418
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S NOT COMING.

20
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,667
Woman:
SHE'S HAD INTERCOURSE.
SOME OLDER BUMPS AND BRUISES.

21
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,936
THE ONLY FRESH MARKINGS
ARE FROM THE CUFFS.

22
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,273
MA'AM, PLEASE
STAY IN THERE.

23
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,178
- CAN'T I JUST GO?
- WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU

24
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,246
TO COME DOWN TO THE STATION
AND GO OVER A FEW THINGS.

25
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,317
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
I CAN TELL YOU.
- I KNOW.

26
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,287
- I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING.
- MISS, WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO KEEP YOUR ITEMS.

27
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:11,523
SIGN THIS.
YOU CAN PUT THESE ON.

28
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,637
Man:
HER DETAILS CHECK OUT.
ADDRESS, CAR REGO--

29
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,873
ALL MATCH THE SUSPECT.
NOW SHE SAID SHE GOT AWAY

30
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,542
- WHEN HE WAS
PUTTING HER IN HIS PLANE.
- YEAH WELL, HE DENIES IT.

31
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,245
SAYS HIS FAMILY IS
OUT OF TOWN AND HE WAS
AT TWO FRIENDS' ALL NIGHT.

32
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:36,515
BOTH CONFIRM IT.
EVEN SOME PIZZA GUY
SAYS HE SAW HIM THERE.

33
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,650
<i>Man #2:
...AND THEN HE
CHAINED YOU TO A POST</i>

34
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,852
<i>AND THEN HE RAPED YOU?</i>

35
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:42,988
I TOLD YOU ALREADY,
THAT WAS BEFORE.

36
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,958
- ON A BEARSKIN.
- YOU TOLD THE OTHER OFFICER
IT WAS A BED.

37
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,393
NO, IT WAS A BEARSKIN
ON THE FLOOR.

38
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,395
WHAT THE FUCK
IS HE TRYING TO DO?

39
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,931
HOW MANY TIMES
DID YOU SAY HE HAD
INTERCOURSE WITH YOU?

40
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,000
ONCE.  HE...

41
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:57,903
JUST ONCE.

42
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,239
WAS IT VAGINALLY OR--
OR ANALLY?

43
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,840
I MEAN, BEFORE YOU SAID
IT WAS BOTH.

44
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,942
LOOK, HE DID IT NORMAL--
ON TOP.

45
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,678
AND THEN HE--

46
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,648
HE WRAPPED THE CHAIN
AROUND MY NECK.

47
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,917
HE WAS GONNA KILL ME.

48
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,953
- YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BED?
- THERE WAS NO BED!

49
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,656
WHEN HE CHAINED ME
HE PUT A BLANKET
DOWN ON THE GROUND.

50
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,791
YOU'RE A PROSTITUTE,
AREN'T YOU?

51
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,761
- IS 23 YOUR REAL AGE?
- { scoffs } YES.

52
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,864
WHY WOULD HE WANT
TO PUT YOU ON A PLANE?

53
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,268
HE SAID HE WANTED
TO TAKE ME TO HIS CABIN.

54
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,636
<i>HMMM.</i>

55

Listen, I've spoken
to this Bob Hansen.

57
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,279
<i>HE HAS TWO FRIENDS THAT SAY
HE WAS WITH THEM ALL NIGHT,</i>

58
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:43,682
AND NOW I'M TRYING
TO WORK OUT IF YOU WERE EVEN
WITH THIS GUY LAST NIGHT.

59

<i>{ phone ringing }</i>

60
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,998

<i>- WAIT, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
- { baby fussing }</i>

62
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,637

65
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,883
DID YOU ALREADY
PACK THE CEREAL?

66
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,018
YEAH, THE KITCHEN'S
MOSTLY PACKED.

67
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,354
- HEY, DAD!
- OH, YOU GONNA CATCH
SOME GRIZZLY BEARS TODAY?

68
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:23,855
WHERE YOU GOIN'?

69
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,958
- ONLY TWO MORE WEEKS.
- WHY DON'T YOU COME ON
BACK TO BED?

70
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,362
I GET THE NEXT DECADE, OKAY?

71
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,467
<i>- DID YOU SIGN THAT CHECK?
- I'M LATE AS IT IS.</i>

72
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,869
HON, THEY'RE NOT GONNA COME
AND MOVE ALL THIS STUFF

73
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,038
<i>- IF YOU DON'T PAY THEM.
-  { door closes }</i>

74
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,984
FOUND HER LAST NIGHT
WAY UP THE KNIK.

75
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:56,355
SERGEANT HAWKS IS TAKING

78
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,912
I DON'T KNOW.

<i>Man:

80

81
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,387
SHE'S FEMALE.

82
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,422
LATE TEENS,
MAYBE EARLY 20s.

83
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,891
MY GIRL HAS A JACKET
JUST LIKE THAT.

84

<i>BEAR DUG HER UP.

<i>SIX MONTHS,
MAYBE A YEAR.</i>

86
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,464
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
SHE WAS HIKING.

87
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,833
- A PURSE?
- THEY'RE STILL SEARCHING.

88
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,503
IT'S GONNA BE A HARD ONE.
ONE OF THE BOYS FOUND
THIS THOUGH,

89
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:47,072
IN THE GRAVE.
EXECUTION STYLE.

90
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,408
YOU EVER WISH YOU'D STAYED
IN WHITE COLLAR, LYLE?

91
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,410
{ chuckles }

92
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,512
YOU SOUND
JUST LIKE MY WIFE.

93
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:55,680
- YOU GONNA TAKE OVER?
- Jack: YEAH.

94
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,917
SHE'S NOT MISSING
ANYMORE.

95
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,422
...SO I ASKED HIM STRAIGHT.
I SAID "DID YOU DO THIS?"

96
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:06,992
HE SAID "YOU CAN'T RAPE
A PROSTITUTE, CAN YOU?"
HOW THE FUCK'S THAT?

97
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,060
{ laughs }
HEY, YOU CAN LET HER GO.

98
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:12,964
- SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.
- SHE'S A PROSTITUTE THAT
REFUSED A POLYGRAPH.

99
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:15,066
- IT'S A DEAD END.
- WHAT DO YOU EXPECT HER TO DO?

100
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,836
- WE SHOULD BE GOING BACK THERE
AND GETTING A WARRANT!
- HEY, LISTEN,

101
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,039
WHO KNOWS WHAT THE FUCK WENT ON.
HANSEN'S AN UPSTANDING CITIZEN.

102
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,142
THE MAN HAS A WIFE,
CHILDREN AND NO RECORD
ON THE COMPUTERS.

103
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,111
THE LIEUTENANT AND I
SPOKE WITH THE D.A.

104
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,847
AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
TO SAY SHE WAS EVEN
IN THE GUY'S PLACE,

105
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,150
SO THERE WON'T BE A WARRANT.
I'M TAKING IT FROM HERE.

106
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,590

THE VICTIM WAS
SHERRY MORROW, 23,

109
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,921
A.K.A. SHERRY GRAVES
OR SHERRY GEORGIA.

110
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,823
SHE WAS REPORTED MISSING
LAST NOVEMBER

111
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,658
AFTER SAYING SHE WAS
GOING TO MEET A MAN

112
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,594
<i>- FOR A $300 PHOTO SESSION.
- { murmuring }</i>

113
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,063
ANY CONNECTION
TO THE JANE DOE
FOUND LAST YEAR

114
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:20,031
- CALLED EKLUTNA ANNIE?
- NO, SHEILA.

115
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:25,036
ANOTHER OFFICER DESCRIBED
SHERRY AND SUE LUNA
AS CARBON COPIES?

116
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,072
THEY WERE BOTH DANCERS
AT THE WILD CHERRY

117
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,207
AND GOOD TIMES CLUBS
AND BOTH SAID THEY

118

<i>WERE LEAVING TO MEET
A PHOTOGRAPHER.</i>

119

LOOK, WE AND A.P.D. ARE
LOOKING AT ALL THREE CASES,

120
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,514
BUT LET ME BE CLEAR:
THERE IS NOTHING NOW

121
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,949
THAT INDICATES ANYTHING
OTHER THAN A COINCIDENCE.

122
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,518
<i>- Woman: ANY EVIDENCE? 
- Sheila: WHAT ABOUT
 THE OTHER GIRLS?</i>

123
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,820
AS OF NOW THEY'RE ONLY
CONSIDERED MISSING PERSONS.

124
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:46,024
- DETAILS ARE IN YOUR HANDOUT.
- Sheila: WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA ADMIT

125
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,593
THERE'S SOMEBODY TAKING
THESE GIRLS?

126
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,962
WELL, WE'RE INVESTIGATING
ANY LINKS,

127
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,298
BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT
THERE'S A MASS MURDERER
OUT THERE.

128
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
THAT'S ALL WE HAVE.
THANK YOU.

129
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,967
<i>Jack:
SOMEBODY WENT TO A LOT
OF TROUBLE GETTING HER THERE.</i>

130
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,136
<i>THERE'S NO ROAD ACCESS.
PROBABLY USED A BOAT.</i>

131
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:33,071

- COULD HAVE DONE THAT CLOSER.

132
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,241
SUSPECT WANTED HER
OUT THERE ALIVE WHERE
THEY WOULDN'T BE DISTURBED.

133
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,143
HE SHOT HER FOUR TIMES--
TWO IN THE LEGS,

134
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,712
TWO IN THE CHEST,
LIKE SHE WAS RUNNING.
THEN HE REDRESSED HER,

135
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,247
WRAPPED A BANDAGE
AROUND HER HEAD.

136
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,116
- SHELL CASE IS A .223.
- SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?

137
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,319
PICKED HER UP FROM A BAR,
OVER AN HOUR DRIVE TO A BOAT.

138
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,354
ALL THE TIME THEY'RE
NEITHER SEEN OR MISSED.

139
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,189
HE'S NOCTURNAL,
METHODICAL.

140
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,625
PROBABLY WORKS NIGHTS.
HIS JOB GIVES HIM TIME.

141
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:54,960
LIKE--
LIKE A SHIFT WORKER.

142
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,195
CHRIST, THAT'S HALF
THE PEOPLE HERE.

143
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,165
BUT WHY LEAVE A SHELL?
IT DOESN'T FIT.

144
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,767
I DON'T THINK
HE'S CARELESS,
MORE OVERCONFIDENT.

145
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,170
HE DIDN'T COUNT ON
THE BODY BEING FOUND.

146
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,238
LIKE THE OTHERS.

147
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,773
WHAT OTHERS?

148
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,275
LIEUTENANT, THIS WAS
TOO WELL-PLANNED.

149
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,344
IT'S NOT A FIRST TIME.
IT'S NOT A ONE-OFF.

150
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,613
HE'S DONE IT BEFORE,
HE'LL DO IT AGAIN.

153
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,320
ONE OF THE MISSING GIRLS'
SISTERS CALLED, WANTS
TO TALK TO SOMEONE.

154
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:25,690
THIS ALSO
FOR WHOEVER'S HEADING UP
THE MISSING DANCER'S CASE.

155
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:27,092
SAID IT'S URGENT.

156
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,796
NO, I'M THE WRONG GUY
TO GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS.

157
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,699
- THIS IS MY LAST TWO WEEKS.
- WELL, BAD LUCK.

158
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,335
YOUR PRECIOUS OIL MONEY
AND 800 MILES OF PIPE
AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

159
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,970

187
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,829
I CAN NEVER SEEM TO GET
THE HANG OF THIS, BOB.

188
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,366
MORE PRESSURE.
LIKE THAT.

189
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,433
OH NICE.

190
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,271
- DID THAT CLAUSEN ORDER
COME IN?
- IT DID.

191
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,873

BUT I CAN HANDLE IT.

192
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,208
OKAY.

196
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,384
OKAY.

203
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,238
YOU HAVE ANYTHING
ON A ROBERT C. HANSEN?

204
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,441
GRABBED SOME GIRL
BACK IN '71.

205
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,845
DROVE HER AT GUNPOINT,
HANDS BOUND AND NAKED, TO
KENAI LAKE AND THEN RAPED HER.

206
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,980
HE GOT FIVE YEARS,
HE WAS OUT IN THREE MONTHS.

207
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:11,282
IT SEEMS
HE JUST HAD A RUN-IN
WITH A PROSTITUTE.

208
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,885
SHE TOLD ANCHORAGE POLICE
THE EXACT SAME STORY.

209
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,120
<i>- WHY ISN'T
THIS GUY ON OUR LIST?
-  THAT WAS 12 YEARS AGO.</i>

210
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,857
- IF WE OPEN IT UP THAT MUCH--
- GET EVERYTHING YOU CAN
FROM ARCHIVE.

211
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:23,394
<i>- AND CHECK ALL MISSING PERSONS
FROM THE SAME PERIOD.

214
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:31,402
EIGHT GIRLS
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS--
ALL LATE TEENS, EARLY 20s,

215
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:35,406
5'2" TO 5'7", 120-125 LBS,
ALL MADE BIG MONEY DATES

216
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:37,375
WITH A STRANGER
AND THEN DISAPPEARED.

217
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,915
CINDY PAULSON, 23,

218
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:46,951
WAS OFFERED $200 FOR A BLOWJOB
AND THEN RAPED AT GUNPOINT.

219
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:49,220
GUY SAID HE LIKED
TO TAKE PICTURES,

220
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,890
WAS GONNA TAKE HER
TO HIS CABIN IN THE WILD,
BUT SHE GOT AWAY.

221
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:56,060
THERE'S NOT ONE LEAD
ON ANY OF THESE GIRLS,
EXCEPT HER.

222
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,629
WHEREVER SHE IS,
WE NEED TO FIND HER.

223
00:14:57,631 --> 00:15:00,098
<i>- HE'S ON.
YOU WANT ME TO COME?
- Jack: NO.</i>

224
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,534
GO BACK THROUGH ALL THE OLDER
FILES AND SEE IF THERE ARE
ANY OTHER GIRLS THAT MATCH.

225

HERE, PUT THIS ON.
TAKE THIS SHIT OFF.

230
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:35,166

LIKE FOR HORSES.

THE HO-STRO--
WHERE THE HO'S STROLL.
EVERYONE KNOWS EVERYONE.

238
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,955
ALL THE PIMPS
KNOW ALL THE OTHER PIMPS,
WHO OWNS WHICH GIRLS,

239
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,523
WHICH GIRLS
ARE THE WILD ONES.

240
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,159
BLACK GIRLS ARE BOOSTERS,
WHITES ARE FLAT-BACKS.

GOOD MONEY-EARNING
BITCH CAN DO BOTH--

01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:32,453
<i>{ engines starting }</i>

1049
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:52,040
<i>Man:
HEY, BOB?  YOU HAVE A MINUTE?</i>

1050
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:54,342
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
HELP US DOWN AT THE STATION.

1051
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:02,517
IN 1971, THERE WAS
AN INCIDENT

1052
01:12:02,519 --> 01:12:05,653
INVOLVING A MISS ALLEN
OVER IN SPENARD.

1053
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,488
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED THERE, BOB?

1054
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,924
WELL, UM,

1055
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:12,026
THAT, UM-- I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

1056
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:15,997
I GUESS YOU COULD JUST...
CALL THAT AN URGE.

1057
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:19,834
AND IS THAT TO DO
WITH WHAT DR. McMANNUS
SAID AT YOUR SENTENCING?

1058
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:23,037
- I CAN'T REMEMBER--
- SCHIZOPHRENIC OR MANIC-
DEPRESSIVE PROBLEMS.

1059
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:26,641
A MENTAL STATE YOU WOULD
SOMETIMES GO INTO

1060
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:28,910
AND THINGS WOULD JUST...
HAPPEN,

1061
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:32,413
BUT THEN
YOU WOULDN'T REMEMBER.
WAS HE OFF-BASE ON THAT?

1062
01:12:32,415 --> 01:12:33,881
IS THAT BOTHERING YOU, BOB?

1063
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:36,884
HEY, LISTEN, WHATEVER
THE PROBLEM IS HERE,

1064
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:39,420
I WANT TO HELP
YOU GENTLEMEN CLEAR IT UP.

1065
01:12:39,422 --> 01:12:41,756
YOU KNOW,
BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN,

1066
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:43,925
UH, MY LAWYER ALWAYS TOLD ME
NEVER TO-- YOU KNOW.

1067
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:47,895
BUT I CAN
HELP YOU CLEAR IT UP.
WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?

1068
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:50,031
- THERE WAS A SECOND INCIDENT...
- MM-HMM.

1069
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:51,866
...IN DECEMBER OF '71.

1070
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:53,901
- YOU WERE ARRESTED
FOR THAT ALSO?
- YEAH YEAH.

1071
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:56,504
<i>-  HER NAME WAS BOWDEN. 
- THAT SITUATION,</i>

1072
01:12:56,506 --> 01:12:59,507
THERE IS YOUR BASIC,
YOU KNOW,

1073
01:12:59,509 --> 01:13:02,543
MONEY FOR SEX...
PROP-PROPOSITION.

1074
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:05,446
I SAID,
"LOOK HEY, YOU KNOW, THIS--
WE AGREED ON A PRICE,

1075
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:08,082
AND GOD DAMN IT,
THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S GONNA BE."

1076
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:10,785
AND SHE JUST KEPT
ARGUING WITH ME--
MORE AND MORE MONEY,

1077
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:12,820
MORE AND MORE MONEY.
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,

1078
01:13:12,822 --> 01:13:14,589
I JUST DROPPED HER OFF
IN ANCHORAGE.

1079
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:17,558
SHE SAYS YOU BOUND HER
WITH A SNARE TRAP AND PUT
A GUN TO HER HEAD.

1080
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,627
- NO.
- AND YOU STARTED GOING
DOWN TOWARDS THE KENAI

1081
01:13:19,629 --> 01:13:21,929
- TO THE SUNSET LODGE
AND RENTED A CABIN.
- THAT PART'S TRUE.

1082
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:25,600
AND SHE SAYS YOU RAPED HER.
AND YOU WROTE HER MOTHER AND
FATHER'S NAME AND ADDRESS

1083
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:28,636
AND HER SON'S NAME DOWN
AND SAID IF SHE TOLD ANYONE,
YOU'D HARM 'EM.

1084
01:13:28,638 --> 01:13:31,439
WELL, I DO REMEMBER
HER NAME BEING WRITTEN DOWN
ON A PIECE OF PAPER

1085
01:13:31,441 --> 01:13:34,642
THAT SHE GAVE ME
TO CONTACT HER,
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER--

1086
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:36,644
<i>- { door opens } 
- Trooper: SERGEANT.</i>

1087
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:42,116
<i>Lyle:
IT'LL TAKE LONGER
THAN WE THOUGHT.</i>

1088
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:45,753
EVERY WALL
IS A HIDDEN CLOSET
CRAMMED WITH STUFF.

1089
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,522
OKAY.  AS SOON
AS YOU GET ANYTHING.

1090
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:49,791
- OKAY, I'M ON IT.
- PLEASE.

1091
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:55,963
SHE WORKED
AT THE EMBERS BAR, 1979.

1092
01:13:55,965 --> 01:13:58,599
OH OH, YEAH YEAH, OKAY.

1093
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:00,735
YEAH, I REMEMBER HER.

1094
01:14:00,737 --> 01:14:03,504
THAT WAS, UH,
PRIMARILY THE SAME THING.

1095
01:14:03,506 --> 01:14:05,840
HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED BY NOW,
BOB, THAT THESE GIRLS

1096
01:14:05,842 --> 01:14:07,708
AREN'T JUST GONNA
PLAY IT COOL WITH YOU?

1097
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:10,011
I MEAN,
YOU KNOW THAT THEY KNOW

1098
01:14:10,013 --> 01:14:12,513
THAT THEY HAVE
A COMMODITY THAT YOU WANT--

1099
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:14,615
AND WITH A NICE WIFE
AT HOME.

1100
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:17,051
- IS THERE A PROBLEM THERE?
- NO.

1101
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:19,787
AT HOME THERE'S
NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

1102
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:23,057
I-- I MENTIONED TO YOU-YOU
BOTH THAT, UH...

1103
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,161
BOTH OF THESE TIMES, UH...

1104
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:29,130
I WANTED ORAL SEX.

1105
01:14:30,867 --> 01:14:37,839
BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT I WOULD WANT-- WANT
MY WIFE TO PERFORM, OKAY?

1106
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:40,041
YOU KNOW,
NOT SOMEBODY THAT

1107
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:42,543
I LOVE AND RESPECT AND--
AND CHERISH AND--

1108
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:45,046
WE'VE GOT
ALL THE BANK STATEMENTS,
OTHER DOCUMENTS,

1109
01:14:45,048 --> 01:14:47,048
NOTHING THAT HAS ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ANY GIRLS.

1110
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,116
<i>- I'm heading to the plane. 
- Okay, good.</i>

1111
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:52,019
ALL RIGHT.
THE PROSTITUTES ARE UPSET,
YOU'RE UPSET.

1112
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:56,057
- YEAH.
- THINGS CAN HAPPEN
IN THAT SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENT.

1113
01:14:56,059 --> 01:14:59,093
BUT LET'S GO BACK
TO MISS ALLEN FOR A MOMENT--

1114
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:01,496
THE YOUNG LADY
OVER IN SPENARD.

1115
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:04,832
SHE WORKED
FOR A REAL-ESTATE COMPANY.

1116
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:08,202
YEAH. WELL, THE FIRST TIME
I'D SEEN HER SHE WAS DOWNTOWN,

1117
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:11,973
AND I HAD AN ATTRACTION
TO HER RIGHT AWAY.

1118
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:15,176
SO, YOU KNOW,
I FOLLOWED HER HOME

1119
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:19,146
AND, UM, SHE JUST SEEMED
LIKE A REALLY NEAT PERSON.

1120
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:21,616
WHAT HAPPENED THE SECOND TIME
YOU WENT OVER?

1121
01:15:21,618 --> 01:15:23,851
- YOU HAD A GUN.
- YEAH WELL...

1122
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,055
I HADN'T INTENDED TO RAPE HER
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

1123
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:38,966
YEAH NO.
IT'S THE SAME.

1124
01:15:38,968 --> 01:15:40,801
THERE'S STOLEN STUFF
EVERYWHERE.

1125
01:15:40,803 --> 01:15:43,804
<i>- YEAH, WE GOT GUYS
OUT AT THE CAMPER TOO.
-  I need more</i>

1126
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:45,706
OR HE'S GONNA WALK.

1127
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,943
I SAID TO MYSELF,
"YOU KNOW-- YOU KNOW, BOB,

1128
01:15:48,945 --> 01:15:51,178
YOU GOTTA HAVE SOME
PRIORITIES IN YOUR LIFE."

1129
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:54,048
WHEN I'VE DONE THIS NOW,
I'VE DONE IT TO MY FAMILY TOO.

1130
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,117
AND I PUT MY WIFE THROUGH
AN AWFUL LOT OF GRIEF

1131
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:58,185
AND I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT ANYMORE, OKAY?

1132
01:15:58,187 --> 01:16:00,922
YOU TOOK SOME
OF THESE GIRLS OUT OR YOU
PICKED 'EM UP FOR SEX?

1133
01:16:00,924 --> 01:16:03,591
- I'M NOT DENYING THAT.
- YEAH, BUT I'M TALKING
ABOUT CASE AFTER CASE

1134
01:16:03,593 --> 01:16:07,161
OVER A PERIOD OF 12 YEARS.
AND ALL THESE GIRLS' CASES ARE
SAYING THE EXACT SAME THING:

1135
01:16:07,163 --> 01:16:09,230
"I WAS BOUND.
I WAS THREATENED."

1136
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:12,066
A GUN OR KNIFE
WAS INVOLVED.

1137
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:15,703
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT EVERYBODY'S MAKING UP
THE SAME STORY?

1138
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:19,006
I'M SHOWING YOU
A PATTERN, BOB,

1139
01:16:19,008 --> 01:16:21,342
AND YOU'RE LYING TO ME.

1140
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:27,214
WELL, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE

1141
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:30,217
YOU'VE GONE TO THIS
UNTOLD AMOUNT OF TROUBLE.

1142
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:33,120
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE BRINGING UP
THINGS FROM MY PAST,

1143
01:16:33,122 --> 01:16:35,189
I WOULD BE AS HARD PRESSED
TO REMEMBER

1144
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:37,191
BACK WHEN I WAS BORN
IN IOWA.

1145
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:43,264
A .223 SHELL CASING
WAS FOUND AT HER GRAVESITE.

1146
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:45,299
SHE WAS SHOT AND KILLED.

1147
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:47,868
YOU'RE TELLING ME
I SHOT THIS PERSON?

1148
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:50,137
BULLSHIT!

1149
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:51,639
I DID NOT SHOOT ANYBODY

1150
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:54,108
AND I WOULD NOT
HURT ANYBODY.

1151
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:56,344
- AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.
- HANSEN'S WIFE DOESN'T
KNOW ANYTHING.

1152
01:16:56,346 --> 01:16:58,145
IT'S LIKE THEY LIVE
IN TWO SEPARATE WORLDS.

1153
01:16:58,147 --> 01:17:00,014
WE FOUND HIS STOLEN MOUNTS
RIGHT ON THE DAMNED WALL.

1154
01:17:00,016 --> 01:17:01,816
THE .223,
THE ARROWHEAD NECKLACE?

1155
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:04,285
ANYTHING THAT LINKS HIM
DIRECTLY TO ONE
OF THE GIRLS?

1156
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:06,687
- HOW'S IT GOING WITH HIM?
- HE STILL DOESN'T WANT
A LAWYER,

1157
01:17:06,689 --> 01:17:08,389
BUT HE'S GIVING US
EVERYTHING WE ALREADY KNOW.

1158
01:17:08,391 --> 01:17:12,393
THE REST IS BABBLE.
LOOK, I NEED THE .223
OR SOMETHING!

1159
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:20,668
WHO IS THAT?

1160
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:22,937
THAT'S SHERRY MORROW.

1161
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:25,906
SHE WAS FOUND ON THE KNIK
WITH AN ACE BANDAGE

1162
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:28,643
WRAPPED AROUND HER FACE
AND HER ARMS.

1163
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:33,014
OR WHAT WAS LEFT OF THEM.

1164
01:17:33,016 --> 01:17:37,151
THERE WAS ALSO
A .223 SHELL CASING

1165
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,153
FOUND AT HER GRAVESITE.

1166
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:42,657
IDENTICAL EXTRACTOR MARKINGS
TO THE SHELL

1167
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:45,126
- WE FOUND AT PAULA'S GRAVE.
- YOU THINK THAT CAME
OUT OF MY GUN?

1168
01:17:45,128 --> 01:17:47,328
- BULLSHIT IT DID!
- WHY ARE YOU TELLING US
THAT EVERYBODY'S WRONG?

1169
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:50,297
- BECAUSE IN THIS CASE THEY ARE.
- YOU SAID THE PSYCHIATRISTS
WERE WRONG,

1170
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:53,234
BUT ADMITTED YOU LIED TO THEM
AND TOLD US YOU DON'T REALLY
HAVE A PROBLEM.

1171
01:17:53,236 --> 01:17:56,103
YOU'RE NOT HEARING VOICES,
YOU'RE NOT SEEING THINGS.

1172
01:17:56,105 --> 01:17:58,205
AND IF THAT'S TRUE...

1173
01:17:58,207 --> 01:18:00,074
THEN THERE'S
A FAR WORSE PROBLEM,

1174
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:02,943
AND IT CANNOT CONTINUE.

1175
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:06,080
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
IT CAN'T BECAUSE IT
NEVER STARTED.

1176
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:09,316
I DIDN'T SHOOT ANYBODY.

1177
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:12,887
YEAH, WE'VE GOT
17 WEAPONS SO FAR.

1178
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:16,857
AL'S RUNNING NUMBERS NOW,
BUT NONE OF 'EM ARE A .223.

1179
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:19,960
WELL YEAH, IT'S ALL
AS CINDY SAID,

1180
01:18:19,962 --> 01:18:22,196
BUT THERE'S NO PRINTS,
FIBERS, ANYTHING.

1181
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:24,098
YEAH WELL, WE'RE RUNNING
OUT OF PLACES TO LOOK.

1182
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:28,235
PROBABLE INSURANCE FRAUD.
NO, NOTHING ON ANY GIRLS.

1183
01:18:28,237 --> 01:18:31,238
MOST OF US DON'T
HAVE MUCH RESPECT
FOR A PROSTITUTE.

1184
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,207
THEY'RE BENEATH US,
AREN'T THEY?

1185
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,943
- I THINK SO.
- WHY ARE THEY BENEATH US, BOB?

1186
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:38,779
WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS.

1187
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:42,316
DIDN'T YOU FIND,
GROWING UP, THAT GIRLS HAD
A CERTAIN POWER OVER YOU?

1188
01:18:42,318 --> 01:18:45,453
THEY KNOW WHAT BOYS
WANT AND THEY CAN DICTATE
WHEN THEY CAN HAVE IT.

1189
01:18:45,455 --> 01:18:48,422
ISN'T IT NICE
WHEN WE GET OLDER
AND WE CAN TURN THE TABLES,

1190
01:18:48,424 --> 01:18:50,391
DOMINATE, TAKE THE LEAD?
ISN'T IT?

1191
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:53,260
DETERMINE WHEN YOU TOUCH
THEM OR WHATEVER?

1192
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:55,429
<i>- WHEN YOU PAY FOR IT.
- RIGHT.</i>

1193
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:58,199
AND THEY WON'T REJECT YOU.
YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT,

1194
01:18:58,201 --> 01:19:00,735
THEY'LL DO WHAT YOU TELL THEM.
THEN YOU PULL OUT THE GUN

1195
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:02,369
AND YOU'RE REALLY
IN CONTROL.

1196
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,073
THEN THEY'RE DEAD.

1197
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:09,176
NOW YOU SAY YOU
DIDN'T RAPE THEM, YOU SAY
YOU DIDN'T SHOOT THEM,

1198
01:19:09,178 --> 01:19:11,245
BUT TURN IT AROUND, BOB.
IF YOU'D READ THOSE REPORTS--

1199
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:12,913
TURN IT AROUND,
PRETEND YOU'RE US--

1200
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:15,249
WOULD YOU THINK
THOSE GIRLS LIED?

1201
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,451
- I BELIEVE THEM.
- WELL, DO YOU WANT
TO CONVICT ME ON THAT?!

1202
01:19:17,453 --> 01:19:19,420
I WANNA FIND OUT
WHO I'M TALKING TO.

1203
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:22,456
I WANT TO SEE
IF YOU HAVE THE GUTS
TO BE HONEST WITH ME!

1204
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:24,458
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1205
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:27,394
I THINK THAT THIS IS
SERIOUS AS HELL,

1206
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:31,031
AND I THINK THAT I'D LIKE
TO TALK TO MY ATTORNEY.

1207
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:34,869
IF YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT
ALL THIS BACK-PASSING STUFF--

1208
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:38,372
AND ABOUT THAT?
I DIDN'T DO THAT!

1209
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,086
YOU THINK YOU GOT AWAY
WITH WHAT YOU DID TO CINDY.

1210
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:55,489
I KNOW WHAT YOU DO
TO THOSE GIRLS.

1211
01:19:57,092 --> 01:20:00,227
- AND I'M GONNA PROVE IT.
- THAT'S GONNA BE HARD,
SERGEANT.

1212
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:03,531
- I HEARD YOU WERE LEAVING.
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE YET.

1213
01:20:03,533 --> 01:20:06,267
ROBERT HANSEN,
I'M ARRESTING YOU

1214
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,269
FOR THE KIDNAP AND RAPE
OF CINDY PAULSON.

1215
01:20:08,271 --> 01:20:10,538
READ HIM THE REST
AND GET HIM OVER
TO THE COURTHOUSE.

1216
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,907
ROBERT CHRISTIAN HANSEN...

1217
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:19,446
FUCKING SON OF A BITCH!
IS THERE ANYTHING FROM HER?

1218
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:22,917
- THE TRUCK, THE PLANE?
- MAYBE HE DID DUMP IT ALL
ALREADY.

1219
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:37,364
CAN YOU GUYS GIVE ME
A MINUTE?

1220
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:10,464
- { sobbing }
- { growls }

1221
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:18,405
Halcombe:
GENTLEMEN, I KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN AT THIS ALL DAY,

1222
01:21:18,407 --> 01:21:20,908
BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T
FOUND WHAT WE NEED.

1223
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:23,510
AND IF WE DON'T
BEFORE WE LEAVE,

1224
01:21:23,512 --> 01:21:25,145
WE'LL NEVER GET
ANOTHER CHANCE.

1225
01:21:25,147 --> 01:21:27,982
SO WE'RE GONNA START AGAIN.

1226
01:21:27,984 --> 01:21:30,451
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM,
EVERY DAMN INCH.

1227
01:21:30,453 --> 01:21:33,120
IF IT MEANS WE STAY ALL NIGHT,
DIG UP THE ENTIRE PROPERTY,

1228
01:21:33,122 --> 01:21:35,189
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO!

1229
01:21:35,191 --> 01:21:38,425
CALL IT TROOPER'S INTUITION.
I KNOW IT'S HERE.

1230
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:40,661
ALL RIGHT, YOU HEARD HIM.
LET'S GET TO IT.

1231
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,467

<i>- YOU OKAY?
- { door closes }</i>

1233
01:21:48,537 --> 01:21:49,970
WE ARRESTED HIM.

1234
01:21:49,972 --> 01:21:51,538
THE JUDGE SAID NO TO BAIL.

1235
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:55,609
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?
SAID YOU WANNA PUT ME
IN SOME SAFE HOUSE.

1236
01:21:55,611 --> 01:21:57,578
- I DON'T WANT TO.
- YOU HAVE TO, CINDY.

1237
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,580
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

1238
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:02,316
WELL, AM I GONNA
HAVE TO TESTIFY?

1239
01:22:02,318 --> 01:22:04,218
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN FACE HIM AGAIN.

1240
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:06,453
HIS LAWYER
IS GOING TO WANT
TO INTERVIEW YOU.

1241

I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE READY, OKAY?

1244
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:18,265
I NEED TO GET MY STUFF.

1245

I'VE GOTTA GO.

1246
01:22:19,635 --> 01:22:21,969

TO GET MY STUFF!
- YEAH.

1247
01:22:21,971 --> 01:22:24,538
I'LL COME BY TOMORROW

WE FOUND A TRAP DOOR.
YOU MAY WANNA SEE THIS.

1252
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:07,481
YOU WERE RIGHT.
HE DIDN'T DUMP IT ALL.

I GOT HER A NEW TOOTHBRUSH

1258
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:44,685
AND SOME SOAP
AND SOME THINGS.

1259
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:46,754
WE FOUND THE GUN.

1260

ISN'T PERFECT,

1263
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:58,499
IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU QUIT
TRYING TO MAKE IT BETTER.

1264
01:24:01,169 --> 01:24:03,704
I THOUGHT A CHANGE
IS WHAT WE NEEDED.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

1266

THAT WAS A MISTAKE?

'CAUSE IF SHE TESTIFIES,

WELL, I'M SAYING

LOOKING OVER EVERYTHING
WE SEIZED AGAIN.

1382
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:58,712
WE FOUND THIS
BEHIND HIS BED,

1383
01:31:58,714 --> 01:32:01,248
AND THE WIFE SAID
HE WAS ALWAYS READING
IT AT NIGHT.

1384

- WHAT ARE THESE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:24,170
AND JOANNA MESSINA'S

AND THE HIGHWAY RUNS--

1390
01:32:29,111 --> 01:32:32,012
SO JOANNA WAS
RIGHT AROUND HERE.

1391
01:32:32,014 --> 01:32:33,113
THIS MARK.

1392
01:32:33,115 --> 01:32:35,181
JESUS.  THAT'S MORE
THAN 20 OF 'EM.

01:32:35,183 --> 01:32:37,150
OH MY GOD!

1394
01:32:38,753 --> 01:32:40,787
WHAT HAS HE DONE?

1395
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:49,129
WAS THERE ANYTHING
LIKE THIS FOUND?

1396
01:32:49,131 --> 01:32:51,097
EXACTLY LIKE THIS?

1397
01:32:51,099 --> 01:32:53,800
THIS IS THE ONE
THAT SUE LUNA'S SISTER
GAVE TO ME.

1398
01:32:53,802 --> 01:32:56,269
SHE SAID THAT SUE WAS
WEARING AN IDENTICAL ONE

1399
01:32:56,271 --> 01:32:58,572
THE DAY SHE DISAPPEARED.

1400
01:32:58,574 --> 01:33:00,273
NO, THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE THAT.

1401
01:33:11,118 --> 01:33:14,287
- YES.
- AND I PAID THE PRICE
FOR THAT.  OKAY?

1402
01:33:14,289 --> 01:33:15,822
<i>- RIGHT?
- Lawyer: YES.  ABSOLUTELY.</i>

1403
01:33:15,824 --> 01:33:17,657
BUT JUST BECAUSE I DID
SOME THINGS IN MY PAST,

1404
01:33:17,659 --> 01:33:20,193
DON'T SAY
THAT I'VE DONE THIS HERE,
BECAUSE I DID NOT!

1405
01:33:20,195 --> 01:33:22,829
<i>- I DID NOT--
I DID NOT KILL ANYONE!
-  OKAY OKAY, BOB, JUST--</i>

1406

<i>- BOB, JUST CALM DOWN.

01:33:24,733 --> 01:33:26,366
SORRY I'M LATE.

1408
01:33:26,368 --> 01:33:28,868
BOB,

1409
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:30,904
WE FOUND THIS AT YOUR HOUSE.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT IT IS?

1410
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:34,107
I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS!
WHAT-- WHAT IS THIS?

1411
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:36,643
IT'S A FLIGHT CHART.
I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN
HUNDREDS OF THEM.

1412
01:33:36,645 --> 01:33:39,245
RIGHT.  AND WHAT'RE
ALL THESE LITTLE MARKINGS
ON IT?  THESE "X"s?

1413
01:33:39,247 --> 01:33:41,314
THOSE ARE PLACES
WHERE I HUNT.

1414
01:33:41,316 --> 01:33:44,284
BUT, BOB, WHY IS
THIS ONE AND THIS ONE

1415
01:33:44,286 --> 01:33:48,755
<i>- AND THESE TWO? 
- Lawyer: ALL RIGHT,
JUST HOLD IT NOW.</i>

1416
01:33:48,757 --> 01:33:51,224
YOU'RE SAYING-- NO WAY.
THOSE ARE JUST PLACES
WHERE I HUNTED.

1417
01:33:51,226 --> 01:33:53,627
OH, I BELIEVE
THEY WERE, BOB.

1418
01:33:53,629 --> 01:33:55,695
- PLACES WHERE YOU'VE HUNTED.
- YEP.

1419
01:33:55,697 --> 01:33:58,231
AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHILE YOU
WERE STUDYING THIS CHART,

1420
01:33:58,233 --> 01:34:00,333
YOU ADDED ON WHERE YOU
HUNTED A GIRL,

1421
01:34:00,335 --> 01:34:03,269
AND THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER,
UNTIL IT'S JUST SOMETHING
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ALONE.

1422
01:34:03,271 --> 01:34:05,338
YOU PUT THESE GIRLS
OUT THERE, DIDN'T YOU, BOB?

1423
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:10,644
- YOU HAD THEIR BLOOD ALL OVER
YOUR HANDS AND YOUR CLOTHES?
- SERGEANT.

1424
01:34:10,646 --> 01:34:14,080
WE FOUND THE GUNS.
JUST A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THE LAB CONFIRMS IT.

1425
01:34:14,082 --> 01:34:15,882
<i>- WELL, NOW JUST
GODDAMNED MINUTE-- 
- SERGEANT!</i>

1426
01:34:15,884 --> 01:34:18,251
THAT'S-- THAT'S HIM.

1427

{ hyperventilating }

1428
01:34:20,188 --> 01:34:22,322
PRETTY BAD WEATHER
FOR A FLIGHT THE OTHER DAY.

1429
01:34:22,324 --> 01:34:24,758
QUITE A PILOT.

1430
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,693
WE ALMOST LOST YOU
A FEW TIMES.

1431
01:34:26,695 --> 01:34:30,130
BUT WE FOUND IT.
THE TRACKS WERE STILL FRESH.

1432
01:34:31,098 --> 01:34:32,399
WHAT IS THAT?

1433
01:34:32,401 --> 01:34:34,901
<i>WELL, BOB KNOWS.
DON'T YOU, BOB?</i>

1434
01:34:36,237 --> 01:34:38,672
SHE HAD A CHILD!

1435
01:34:38,674 --> 01:34:41,808
<i>ALMOST THE SAME AGE
AS YOUR SON, BOB.</i>

1436
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:45,245
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHY ARE YOU SO QUIET?

1437
01:34:45,247 --> 01:34:47,313
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
KILLING SUE LUNA?

1438
01:34:47,315 --> 01:34:51,084
DID YOU TAKE IT OFF HER
BEFORE OR AFTER
YOU RAPED HER?

1439
01:34:51,086 --> 01:34:53,953
- THIS MEETING'S OVER.
I NEED TO TALK TO MY CLIENT.
- NO, I'M TRYING TO HELP HIM.

1440
01:34:53,955 --> 01:34:57,090
YOU SEE, WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING
A CLOSE LOOK AT WHERE ALL
THESE LITTLE MARKS ARE.

1441
01:34:57,092 --> 01:34:59,826
NOW THIS MAP HAS 24 ON IT,

1442
01:34:59,828 --> 01:35:02,462
LEADING US TO CONCLUDE THAT
THERE MIGHT BE 24 GIRLS
OUT THERE,

1443
01:35:02,464 --> 01:35:05,231
AND IF WE FIND A BODY,
WE'RE GONNA CHARGE HIM
WITH MURDER!

1444
01:35:05,233 --> 01:35:09,302
BOB, I CAN'T STOP IT--
YOU, YOUR FAMILY, THE MEDIA.

1445
01:35:09,304 --> 01:35:11,404
THE GROUND'S FROZEN NOW,
BUT COME EVERY SUMMER

1446
01:35:11,406 --> 01:35:13,440
WHEN THE SNOW
AND THE ICE MELT,
I'LL KEEP GOING

1447
01:35:13,442 --> 01:35:15,241
UNTIL I'VE CHECKED
EVERY LAST MARK.

1448
01:35:15,243 --> 01:35:18,411
I'M GOING TO ASK
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
TO PETITION THE GOVERNOR

1449
01:35:18,413 --> 01:35:23,750
WITH ALL THE BODIES WE'LL FIND,
HE'LL GET IT, SO IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO TELL US THE TRUTH NOW,

1450
01:35:23,752 --> 01:35:26,286
- WE CAN'T HELP YOU THEN!
- YOU THINK CAN THREATEN ME?
