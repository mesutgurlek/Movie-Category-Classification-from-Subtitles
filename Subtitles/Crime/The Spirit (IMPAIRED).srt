Hey, baby.

168
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,404
- Ellen.
- You're a mess.

169
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,614
Three bullets across the deltoid.

170
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,159
They went straight through me.
Hardly took any meat.

171
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,453
Major contusions
on any visible skin.

172
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,496
Oh, come on, Ellen.
They never last long.

173
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,708
Evidence of a profusely bleeding
cranial wound.

174

No, that's nothing.
That's just a bump.

- Central City, U.S.A.

186

187
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,498
This year.

188
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,792

- The Spirit.

189
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,461
- I beat up bad guys.
- And sometimes they beat you up.

190
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,631
And it really hurts when that happens,
but I always get better.

191
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,176
I don't know why, you don't know why.
But The Octopus knows something.

192
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,344
Why do you say that?

193
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,346
Because he told me
he knows something.

- No.

That was close, buddy.

There. That's better.

Yup. That's better.

Dr. Ellen Dolan!
Over here, right now!

204
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,379
I can hear fluid in his chest.

205
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,214
It's faint, but I swear it's there.

206
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,889
I got it.
He's got blood in both his lungs.

207
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,683
Stabilize him, get him on Pegasus.

208
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,060
- Go back to the helicopter.
MEDIC: I'll flip him over.

209

ELLEN: No, leave him flat.
Get me new gloves. Gauze.

I gave it my best shot.

Oh, what that serum did

1031
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:46,478

But I could be your spy.

Better.

- Not a god. Not exactly.

1066
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,919
Yeah, because, you know, humans
and gods, they don't mix very well.

1067
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:39,382
The only route to take is to find the
connection between man and god...

1068
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,718
...the child
of an immortal and a human.

1069
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:45,847
See, Zeus couldn't keep it in his pants,
so he made bags and bags of heroes.

1070
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,391
Now, the greatest of them all
was Heracles.

1071
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:50,727
And we found his ass.

1072
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,438
Well, his blood anyway.
He left some blood around.

1073
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:54,939
And we know where it is.

1074
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:59,777
So that's the missing link
between science and magic.

1075
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:04,282
Now, once Heracles' blood mixes
with Octopus' formula....

1076
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,619
- I become a god.
- Or the next best thing.

1077
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:09,621
I become a god.

1078
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:12,832
And you'll be just one more
sad little byproduct.

1079
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:15,293
One of his many,
many, many failures.

1080

Come on, now.
Rome wasn't built in a day.

1081
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:22,467
Besides, look at all the lovely buddies
I've made along the way.

1082
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:23,676
We was easy to make.

1083
01:10:23,844 --> 01:10:25,720
Yeah, the boss says
we was easy to make.

1084
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,972
But your failures were several.

1085
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,475
And unpleasant.

1086
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:33,978
Yeah, you know,
you get so much as one little drop...
