126
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:22,939
 So, tell me, Mai.              
 What line of work are you in?  

127
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:26,676
     - I'm an entertainer.      
     - An entertainer?          

128
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:32,215
And how many cocks              
can you entertain with that cute
little cum-Dumpster of yours?   

129
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,756
What do you think               
of his line of work?            

130
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,260
I'm not talking                 
about the fag boxing club.      

131
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:48,965
I'm talking about               
where the money comes from.     

132
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,867
You know what he does, right?   

133
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,904
      He deals drugs, Mai.      

134
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:58,308
  Heroin, cocaine. That's       
  where the money comes from.   

135
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,578
    That's how he can afford    
    to pay you to fuck him.     

136
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,019
 Oh, great. I'll get the crab.  
 He'll have the spicy chicken.  

137
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:15,892
 And May here will have a salad 
 with the dressing on the side. 

138
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:18,361
           It's Mai.            

139
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,201
           I'm sorry.           

140
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:29,105
  I apologize for my behavior.  

141
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:34,677
      It's just that            
      I'm a little upset.       

142
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,647
   I have lost my first son.    

143
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:45,188
      I'm sorry for that.       

144
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,256
           Thank you.           

145
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:52,829
It's good to know someone cares.

146
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:58,234
'Cause I swear to God, sometimes
I think Julian hated Billy.     
Maybe "hate" is the wrong word. 

147
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:01,704
      But you were always       
      jealous of him.           

148
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:07,343
You know the way boys are, May. 
Competitive.                    

149
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:12,015
  And what with Billy           
  being the older brother       
  and having a bigger cock...   

150
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:15,785
   Julian's was never small,    
   but Billy's was...           

151
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:18,755
      Oh, it was enormous.      

152
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,426
 How can you compete with that? 

153
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:33,670
      Billy was everything      
      Julian wanted to be.      

154
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,942
       Is that not true?        

155
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:47,817
   'Cause let me tell you,      
   if the tables were turned,   

156
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,053
     your brother would         
     have found your killer     

157
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:54,357
    and brought me his head     
    on a fucking platter!

160
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:13,776
    I don't want to talk        
    about it anymore.           
    Do you mind if I smoke?

     [Mai] I don't want it.

        that dress, take it off.

 - I was leaving tonight.       

238
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:53,928
     And your other son?        
     Is he going with you?      

239
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,432
      What, Julian? Oh...       

240
01:13:57,434 --> 01:14:02,470
    I haven't had any           
    real contact with Julian    
    since he left America.      

241
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:07,508
 But you were there last night.

01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:05,700
And it breaks my heart that     
Billy got caught up in the scene
here because of him.            

245
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:12,874
    Billy was my first son.

01:15:12,876 --> 01:15:16,777
     We had a very              
     special relationship.      

247
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:21,182
     Julian was so jealous.     
     It was like he was         
     cracked or something.      

248
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,886
   He had paranoid delusions    
   about us.                    

249
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:29,624
      And it pains me           
      to say this to you,       

250
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:33,594
  as it would pain any mother,  

251
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:39,600
  but he killed his own father  
  with his bare hands.
