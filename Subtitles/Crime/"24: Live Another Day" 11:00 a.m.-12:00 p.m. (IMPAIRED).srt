(speaking foreign language)

3
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,062
Where are we
on real-time tracking?

4
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:58,431
Backdooring off a satellite
the Brits have overhead.

5
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,488
Hey, Kate,
friendly reminder.

6
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:24,157
I'm gonna need
your passcodes

7
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:26,526
and decryption keys
before you clear out

8
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,094
at the end
of the week.

9
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:29,562
Right. I'm not gonna forget.

10
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:32,465
Oh, Mariana...

11
00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:33,866
What's going on out there?

12
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:37,303
Got a tip that a high-value
suspect is here in London.

13
00:01:37,337 --> 00:01:39,605
Is it connected
to the president being here?

14
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,908
That's the speculation.

15
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:40,833
Man:
Positive I.D. On the target.

16
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:43,402
30 feet from the South wall.
Here we go.

17
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:10,797
The target's on the run!

18
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:12,899
Go, go, go, team one!

19
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:32,919
(Gasps)

20
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:48,601
It's him...

21
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:50,303
Jack Bauer.

22
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,908
All right, he's taken
Miller out. Has his weapon.

23
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:56,909
Armstrong, Cutler,

24
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:58,277
he's coming your way.

25
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:00,847
(Man yells)

26
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:12,625
(Coughing)

27
00:04:31,678 --> 00:04:33,713
(Gunshot)

28
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:00,306
Continuing pursuit.

29
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,508
He'll head for the roof.
That's the best way out.

30
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:05,478
Bauer's on the move!
He's heading outside!

31
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:07,380
Well, that doesn't make sense.

32
00:05:07,414 --> 00:05:09,082
Kate, please?

33
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:17,223
(Man yells)

34
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:24,664
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

35
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:26,632
Damn it! Move, move!

36
00:05:28,268 --> 00:05:30,636
Target is moving west,
on his way to the river.

37
00:06:05,305 --> 00:06:08,307
On your knees!
Hands behind your head.

38
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,414
We got him.

39
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,684
(Crowd clamoring)

40
00:06:54,822 --> 00:06:56,622
Man: The prime minister is
putting pressure on parliament

41
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:57,824
to extend their lease,

42
00:06:57,858 --> 00:07:00,093
but the vote
is too close to call.

43
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:01,794
People are just
not comfortable

44
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:04,897
with our using drones
for targeted assassinations.

45
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:09,035
(Clamoring continues)

46
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:11,003
Mr. president?

47
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:14,607
I'm thinking I don't blame them,

48
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:16,709
I'm uncomfortable
with the drones, also.

49
00:07:16,744 --> 00:07:19,979
The ugly truth is,
what we're doing is working.

50
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:23,015
Worse-case scenario,
if we lose the base,

51
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,617
do we have anything new?

52
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,719
No other country in the region
is willing

53
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:28,321
to host an American base
right now.

54
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:31,057
In part because the
Chinese are making it clear

55
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:32,725
that they don't want us
in the area.

56
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,193
And they're spreading
their wings.

57
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:36,863
Beijing just acknowledged they
have a carrier group heading

58
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:39,899
for the Mediterranean.
For the first time in history.

59
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,300
It's clearly intended

60
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,835
to intimidate the British
over the lease.

61
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,838
The Chinese Navy are calling it
their "friendship tour."

62
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:48,808
Taking a page
from Franklin Roosevelt.

63
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:50,243
Sir?

64
00:07:50,277 --> 00:07:51,911
Well, fdr, he sailed
the great white fleet

65
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:55,515
all over the world,
early 1900's,

66
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:58,651
called it the
"goodwill tour."

67
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,086
Basically
the same thing.

68
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,921
Just a show of force.

69
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:06,926
I have to work on my speech.
Thank you, gentlemen.

70
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:10,363
Thank you.

71
00:08:10,397 --> 00:08:12,298
(Quietly):
Okay...

72
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:16,569
Uh, Mr. president?

73
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:21,207
It was, um,

74
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:22,875
it was Theodore Roosevelt.

75
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,377
Who?

76
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:26,012
You said Franklin Roosevelt
sailed

77
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:27,747
the great white fleet
around the world.

78
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:29,048
It was, it was Teddy.

79
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,117
Well, thank you, Mark.

80
00:08:31,151 --> 00:08:33,586
When you're retire
as my chief of staff,

81
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,221
you're gonna have a real place
on<i> jeopardy!</i>

82
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:37,490
(Chuckles)

83
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:44,297
(Quietly):
Don't worry about me.

84
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:45,965
That's an order.

85
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
Yes, sir.

86
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:57,043
Give me a second. Sir.

87
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:59,912
You have a call from a local
CIA head of station.

88
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:01,280
He say what it was about?

89
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:02,915
He didn't.

90
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,751
This is Mark Boudreau.

91
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:06,452
Steve Navarro, sir.

92
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:08,154
My station just apprehended
a man

93
00:09:08,188 --> 00:09:10,456
with a multi-agency
warrant issued against him.

94
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:12,492
You're at the top
of the alert list.

95
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:13,893
Who is he?

96
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:16,362
Jack Bauer.

97
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,800
Are you sure?

98
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,001
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:27,807
Where was he caught?

100
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:30,443
The old Chatham and Dominion
factory 20 kilometers

101
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:31,911
southeast of
central London.

102
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:34,013
It can't be
a coincidence.

103
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:35,815
I agree.

104
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:38,951
Jack Bauer is a traitor
and a psychopath

105
00:09:38,986 --> 00:09:40,520
who killed
two Russian diplomats,

106
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:43,423
and came close to assassinating
their president.

107
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,793
And now after all these
years, he surfaces in London

108
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:48,828
the same time
as president Heller?

109
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,699
We have to consider
the possibility that he is here

110
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,133
to do the president harm

111
00:09:54,168 --> 00:09:55,802
and there may be other people
involved.

112
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:58,104
I'll be interrogating him
shortly, and find out.

113
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:00,206
We don't have time for the
interrogations you'll conduct.

114
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,276
I understand there are special
activities people on site.

115
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,011
Well, they have a unit inside
our facility,

116
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:06,779
but they operate under
a separate charter.

117
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,848
We don't share intel
or prisoners with each other.

118
00:10:08,882 --> 00:10:12,785
But I can have him formally
transferred into their custody?

119
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,987
Yes, sir.

120
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:16,155
Great. I'll get started
on that. Send me over

121
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,625
Bauer's case file
and keep his presence there

122
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,160
on a need-to-know basis.
Thank you.

123
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,466
No one finds out Bauer's
surfaced on our end either,

124
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,667
do you understand?

125
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:29,535
What about the president, sir?

126
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,237
I said no one.

127
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:43,683
Hey.

128
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:45,518
Congratulations
on apprehending Bauer.

129
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:47,253
That's a big one.

130
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:53,281
I hate to lose you, Kate.

131
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:56,084
It's not fair
and it's not your fault.

132
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:00,221
I'll let you get back to it.

133
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:02,156
Why didn't he go to the roof?

134
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:03,391
What? Bauer. He could have

135
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:05,626
gone to the roof
when our men were moving in.

136
00:11:05,661 --> 00:11:08,162
And from there, he would've made
it to any of the other buildings

137
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:10,231
on the block and he'd
have gotten away.

138
00:11:10,265 --> 00:11:11,632
It doesn't make any sense.

139
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,836
Maybe he didn't scout out
an escape route.

140
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,771
Bauer stayed off the grid
for the last four years.

141
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:19,674
He didn't do that
by being careless.

142
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:24,979
He's up to something.

143
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,468
Good morning.

144
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:04,069
Not for long.
Major Shepherd wants you

145
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:05,404
to call him as soon
as you arrive.

146
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:06,772
Sounded pissed.

147
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:07,907
About what?

148
00:12:07,941 --> 00:12:08,941
Didn't say.

149
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:19,285
Drone holding at 19,000 feet,

150
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:20,653
80 knots.

151
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:30,396
Good luck with Shepherd.

152
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,228
Thanks.

153
00:12:40,874 --> 00:12:42,875
(Phone ringing)
Excuse me.

154
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:46,412
Sir, it's lieutenant Tanner.

155
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:47,947
You knew your mission
was to fly cover

156
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:50,983
while I escorted
British officers to their unit.

157
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:53,319
Yes, sir. Yet, you didn't
notify their air command.

158
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:55,488
Sir, that wasn't in your orders.

159
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:56,989
Shouldn't have to be.

160
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:58,524
Get it authorized.

161
00:12:58,558 --> 00:12:59,525
Right away.

162
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,960
Yet another dereliction of duty.

163
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:02,461
You're on base
until further notice.

164
00:13:02,496 --> 00:13:04,263
Sir, I... I have a weekend pass.

165
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:05,498
My wife and I...

166
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:08,167
The pass is revoked.

167
00:13:11,004 --> 00:13:14,473
Bastard.

168
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:17,309
Get that file to
the chief of staff.

169
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:19,612
And set Bauer up
in interrogation.

170
00:13:19,646 --> 00:13:21,680
But I thought Special Activities
was gonna handle that.

171
00:13:21,715 --> 00:13:23,449
I want to see what
I can get out of him

172
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:24,884
before that transfer
comes through,

173
00:13:24,918 --> 00:13:26,418
and those people do
God knows what to him.

174
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,572
(Beeping)

175
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:14,767
Walk him down to interrogation.

176
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,447
Good grab, Erik.

177
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:30,182
Thanks.

178
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:31,617
I'd like to take a look
at the original intercept

179
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:33,018
from Prague, the one

180
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:34,720
that gave us Bauer's location.

181
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:36,388
Why?

182
00:14:36,423 --> 00:14:39,191
I just want to make sure
that we're not missing anything.

183
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:42,094
Like you thinking Bauer
would head for the roof...

184
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,663
when he didn't?

185
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:51,224
I just, I just want
to take a quick look.

186
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,175
You're not cleared for that.

187
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:00,311
Look.

188
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:20,694
- Sir.
- Yeah?

189
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:24,465
Uh, I thought you should know,
Kate was asking about the Bauer op

190
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,784
she wanted to see the intercept
that helped us catch him.

191
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:28,159
Is that right?

192
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:29,938
Yeah, but I didn't give it to her.

193
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,015
I just wanted to make sure you were aware.

194
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:34,892
And that she's still
being transfered stateside?

195
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,554
She's still leaving at the end of the week,

196
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,562
and you're still on track to get her job.

197
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,189
That's not even what I'm asking.

198
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:41,676
Yes, it is.

199
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,652
And instead of shoving her out the door,
you should be learning from her.

200
00:15:45,202 --> 00:15:46,548
She was a good field agent.

201
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:49,254
With all due respect, how could that be?

202
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:50,928
And considering what happened...

203
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:54,078
Now you have a lot of strong opinions,
for someone who just got here.

204
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:55,985
I'm just telling it like it is.

205
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:58,927
I mean, her own husband
selling secrets to the Chinese?

206
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:01,581
- And she didn't know?
- And no one knows that better than her

207
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:03,869
so cut her some slack until she goes.

208
00:16:04,235 --> 00:16:06,674
It's just a few more days,
you can manage that, right?

209
00:16:31,403 --> 00:16:32,211
Hey.

210
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:37,079
To hell with Erik.

211
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:40,458
I pulled that intercept for you,
but first there's something I want to say.

212
00:16:41,315 --> 00:16:43,257
You've worked your whole life
to get here Kate.

213
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,505
You can't let them do this to you,
you have to fight the transfer.

214
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,873
I did fight, for two months
locked in a room

215
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:50,968
while they accused me
of being a part of what Adam did.

216
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:52,354
But you were cleared.

217
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,065
You deserve to be here Kate.

218
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,835
Do I really?

219
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:00,969
Because I think Adam proved otherwise.

220
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:05,900
Here.

221
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,193
Did you look at this?

222
00:17:07,245 --> 00:17:08,779
I brought it straight to you.

223
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:17,054
Look at the message
from Prague police about Bauer.

224
00:17:17,088 --> 00:17:18,789
You see the header?

225
00:17:18,823 --> 00:17:20,024
Yeah.

226
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:21,058
Time stamp's out of sequence

227
00:17:21,092 --> 00:17:22,626
with the rest of the traffic.

228
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:24,795
Which means the tip couldn't
have come from Prague.

229
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,530
That it was planted.
Exactly.

230
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:28,599
We need to find out by who.

231
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:30,100
Well, we better do it soon.
Bauer's about to be transferred

232
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:31,568
to Special Activities.

233
00:17:31,603 --> 00:17:33,304
Once he's down
that rabbit hole,

234
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:34,838
he's gone.

235
00:17:40,698 --> 00:17:42,313
You able to establish
a baseline?

236
00:17:42,347 --> 00:17:43,948
Not a reliable one.

237
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:46,116
His reading's are so steady,
it's unnatural.

238
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:49,453
Pulse and thermal,
all completely static.

239
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,254
Let's see
if we can shake him up.

240
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:05,126
Steven Navarro, head of station.

241
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:08,337
Listen, you've been on my side of this

242
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,561
plenty of times
so I'm just gonna lay it out.

243
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:14,144
There's a long line of people
who will make sure

244
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:17,781
that you answer for the crimes
you committed four years ago.

245
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:19,750
All I care about right now
is to find out

246
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:23,287
if you're here in London
to harm president Heller.

247
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:26,257
And I'm not
the only one who cares.

248
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,858
There's an order coming

249
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:29,827
to transfer you to
the Special Activities division

250
00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:32,129
for enhanced interrogation.

251
00:18:32,163 --> 00:18:33,864
You more than anyone know

252
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:35,833
what they're going
to do to you down there.

253
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:39,503
Now, I know how many
lives you've saved.

254
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:43,040
How much the country
is in your debt.

255
00:18:43,074 --> 00:18:44,675
But they're just gonna see

256
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:47,611
a man who snapped.

257
00:18:47,646 --> 00:18:50,714
Who went on a revenge spree.

258
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:54,485
Killing and mutilating with no
regard to the law or conscience.

259
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,786
A man who's labeled

260
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,523
by his country a... a criminal.

261
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:04,561
A terrorist.

262
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:14,505
So, I think talking to me

263
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:18,209
is your best option.

264
00:19:19,244 --> 00:19:21,145
Tell me why you're in London.

265
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,247
And I will do everything in my
power to stop Special Activities

266
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:25,282
from getting their hands on you.

267
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:29,053
Come on, Mr. Bauer.

268
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:31,455
Why are you here?

269
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:41,931
Jack Bauer's being transfered
down to you, here's his file.

270
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,117
(Grunting)

271
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:06,190
Where's the rest
of your group, O'Brian?

272
00:20:06,224 --> 00:20:07,892
Go to hell!

273
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:12,162
(Screaming)

274
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:15,199
No! No! No!

275
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:17,234
(Screaming)

276
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:41,267
Woman:
Hey, Mark?

277
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:42,950
Yes hon?

278
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:44,328
I'm almost ready.

279
00:20:54,406 --> 00:20:56,540
Hey, is my jewelry box
in there?

280
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:58,742
Yeah.

281
00:20:58,777 --> 00:21:01,078
Got it.

282
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:09,086
Wow.

283
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,488
(Quiet laugh)

284
00:21:19,597 --> 00:21:21,298
Here.

285
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,939
You read my mind.

286
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:31,942
Maybe you shouldn't
go to the reception.

287
00:21:31,976 --> 00:21:33,444
Why?

288
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:35,746
Well, with you
looking like that,

289
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,315
no one's gonna pay
any attention to politicians.

290
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,752
No, they're gonna be
distracted by your tie.

291
00:21:41,786 --> 00:21:44,088
My tie?

292
00:21:44,122 --> 00:21:46,290
Here.

293
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:48,125
We should probably get going.

294
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,694
Your father's probably
downstairs waiting for us.

295
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:51,795
How's he doing?

296
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,364
He's doing good.

297
00:21:53,398 --> 00:21:55,699
I heard he made a mistake
in your meeting.

298
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:57,468
Well...

299
00:21:57,502 --> 00:21:59,503
It's a mistake
anyone would make.

300
00:21:59,537 --> 00:22:02,506
The doctors said he wouldn't
symptomatic for another year.

301
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,008
Well, they also said

302
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:06,343
that stress could
exacerbate his condition.

303
00:22:06,378 --> 00:22:09,913
Trust me, he's handling
the stress better than I am.

304
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,617
I don't want you to worry, okay?

305
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:15,386
Okay.

306
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,421
(Knocking)

307
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:21,925
Come in.

308
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:26,430
I have an update
on the Bauer situation.

309
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:29,967
Good morning,
Mrs. Boudreau.

310
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:31,669
Just, uh, want
to let you know

311
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:32,736
your car is here.

312
00:22:32,771 --> 00:22:33,871
Thanks, Ron.

313
00:22:33,905 --> 00:22:35,039
We'll see you downstairs.

314
00:22:35,073 --> 00:22:36,340
Okay, I'll be right down.

315
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:45,015
Sorry, sir.

316
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,550
Talk to me.

317
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:49,420
The transfer order's
been processed.

318
00:22:49,454 --> 00:22:51,088
Special activity
should have Bauer shortly.

319
00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:55,025
I'm thinking about
what happens next,

320
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,562
after they get what
they can from Bauer.

321
00:22:58,596 --> 00:23:00,664
Well, I imagine
he goes on trial.

322
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:03,200
That may not be the best
thing for this country.

323
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:04,702
Is there
an alternative?

324
00:23:04,736 --> 00:23:06,937
He could disappear.

325
00:23:06,972 --> 00:23:09,273
The Russians
have wanted Bauer's head

326
00:23:09,307 --> 00:23:11,241
since he murdered
their people.

327
00:23:11,276 --> 00:23:12,710
I want you to explore
the possibility

328
00:23:12,744 --> 00:23:14,211
of handing him
over to them.

329
00:23:14,245 --> 00:23:15,746
Clandestinely.

330
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,514
The president should
be made aware.

331
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:18,749
(Scoffs)

332
00:23:18,783 --> 00:23:20,784
The president has
enough on his mind.

333
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:23,120
Look, you weren't there.

334
00:23:23,154 --> 00:23:25,122
You don't know what Bauer
did to that family;

335
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:26,457
what he did to Audrey.

336
00:23:26,491 --> 00:23:29,860
She was lifeless;

337
00:23:29,894 --> 00:23:31,528
she was unresponsive;

338
00:23:31,563 --> 00:23:33,430
under psychiatric care...

339
00:23:33,465 --> 00:23:35,633
Not expected to recover.

340
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,768
I had no idea.

341
00:23:37,802 --> 00:23:40,237
I stood by her
for three years.

342
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:42,573
I held her hand,
I loved her,

343
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:45,109
and I want her back.

344
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,413
As long as she lives,

345
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:51,982
she'll never hear
the name Jack Bauer.

346
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:55,352
Understood.

347
00:23:56,521 --> 00:23:59,189
Just get me what I need.

348
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,854
(Crowd shouting, jeering)

349
00:24:35,528 --> 00:24:37,896
(Crowd clamoring, chanting)

350
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:49,074
(Crowd chanting, clamoring)

351
00:24:55,582 --> 00:24:57,683
Steve:
Jack... can I call you Jack?

352
00:24:59,152 --> 00:25:01,687
Your options
are running out fast.

353
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:03,322
That transfer order
is coming through.

354
00:25:03,356 --> 00:25:05,357
After that, I can't help you.

355
00:25:07,928 --> 00:25:09,929
Or...

356
00:25:11,698 --> 00:25:15,034
I can arrange it so that
you can see your daughter again.

357
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,605
Did you know that Kim
had another baby?

358
00:25:20,607 --> 00:25:22,408
A boy.

359
00:25:26,713 --> 00:25:29,014
Any update on
the Bauer intercept?

360
00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:30,149
Actually, yeah.

361
00:25:30,183 --> 00:25:31,817
The intercept originated

362
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:33,085
from a local
Internet cafe,

363
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,687
just on the other
side of town.

364
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:36,655
Did you check the cafe
for surveillance cameras?

365
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,824
Snake eyes on that,
but look... here.

366
00:25:38,858 --> 00:25:41,660
The cafe,
see where it is?

367
00:25:41,695 --> 00:25:43,929
That's three blocks
from where we got Bauer.

368
00:25:43,964 --> 00:25:46,599
Whoever planted that intercept
had to know our comm protocols,

369
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:47,866
and where Bauer was hiding.

370
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:49,201
That's a pretty short list.

371
00:25:49,236 --> 00:25:52,771
Yeah, I only know
one person on it.

372
00:25:52,806 --> 00:25:55,040
What if Bauer sent
the message himself?

373
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:57,042
Why would he plant a tip he knew
would get himself caught?

374
00:25:57,077 --> 00:25:59,245
That's what we need
to find out.

375
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,246
Where you going?

376
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,248
Navarro needs to know.

377
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,417
(Lock beeps, clicks)

378
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,354
Steve:
What are you doing?

379
00:26:08,388 --> 00:26:09,622
I need to talk to you.

380
00:26:09,656 --> 00:26:10,789
It's important.

381
00:26:15,595 --> 00:26:17,463
This better be good.

382
00:26:17,497 --> 00:26:19,898
The intercept that gave us
Bauer's location...

383
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:21,600
it didn't come from
Prague police.

384
00:26:21,635 --> 00:26:24,036
Back up. How do you know
about the intercept?

385
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,271
It was planted.

386
00:26:25,305 --> 00:26:26,305
It originated
just three blocks

387
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:27,773
from where we grabbed Bauer.

388
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:29,475
I think Bauer may have
planted it himself.

389
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:31,210
So you're saying that Bauer
wanted us to catch him?

390
00:26:31,244 --> 00:26:32,778
Which explains why he
didn't go to the roof

391
00:26:32,812 --> 00:26:33,913
during the operation.

392
00:26:33,947 --> 00:26:34,980
He wasn't trying to get away;

393
00:26:35,015 --> 00:26:36,482
he was trying to get caught.

394
00:26:36,516 --> 00:26:38,250
That intercept could've
been sent by anyone

395
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:39,418
who wanted to catch Bauer.

396
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:40,886
We need to ask him about it.

397
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:41,987
If we're right,
maybe he'll open up.

398
00:26:42,022 --> 00:26:42,988
Mariana:
Excuse me, sir.

399
00:26:43,023 --> 00:26:44,957
The transfer order.

400
00:26:44,991 --> 00:26:46,492
Well, that's it, Kate.

401
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:47,726
It's now in
Special Activities' hands.

402
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:49,161
Sir, we can't just
let this go.

403
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:51,230
Get Erik over here.
I want him to take care of

404
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,332
the transfer... got it?
Mariana: Yes, sir.

405
00:26:53,366 --> 00:26:55,000
(Beep)
Kate!

406
00:26:56,703 --> 00:26:58,337
Damn it!
Get that door open!

407
00:26:58,371 --> 00:27:01,240
That tip from Prague was
sent by you, wasn't it?

408
00:27:01,274 --> 00:27:02,808
You arranged to be caught.

409
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:04,610
You wanted to be brought here
to this facility.

410
00:27:04,644 --> 00:27:06,645
You're after something
or someone.

411
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:14,086
It's someone, isn't it?

412
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,221
Who?

413
00:27:16,456 --> 00:27:18,524
Who is it?

414
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:19,858
Who is it?

415
00:27:19,893 --> 00:27:22,861
(Lock beeps, clicks)
Steve: Kate!

416
00:27:22,896 --> 00:27:24,630
Kate...

417
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:25,864
Get out of here right now.

418
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:27,299
Look, he is flat
the entire session,

419
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:29,101
but when I hit him about
faking the intercept

420
00:27:29,135 --> 00:27:30,269
and wanting to be caught,
he spikes.

421
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:32,504
Let's go.
It's a reaction.

422
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:33,572
It's means I'm onto something.
Kate!

423
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,381
Bauer is here for a reason and
we need to find out what it is,

424
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:44,016
and what he's planning on doing.

425
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,352
This isn't about Bauer,
this is about Adam.

426
00:27:46,386 --> 00:27:48,053
Adam?

427
00:27:48,088 --> 00:27:49,822
Your husband betrayed his
country and he betrayed you

428
00:27:49,856 --> 00:27:51,724
and now you're transferring
your frustration onto Bauer.

429
00:27:51,758 --> 00:27:53,192
That's not what
this is about.

430
00:27:53,226 --> 00:27:54,526
Believe me, I understand
how you feel.

431
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:56,395
Adam was my friend.
He betrayed me, too.

432
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:58,497
You're psychoanalyzing me
instead of listening...

433
00:27:58,531 --> 00:28:01,133
Kate... let it go.

434
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:02,902
If Bauer's going
to Special Activities,

435
00:28:02,936 --> 00:28:04,303
then it's a damned good bet

436
00:28:04,337 --> 00:28:06,672
that's exactly where
he wants to be.

437
00:28:06,706 --> 00:28:09,742
You know what?

438
00:28:10,777 --> 00:28:12,077
Forget finishing
out the week.

439
00:28:12,112 --> 00:28:13,379
You're leaving now.

440
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:16,215
Escort her out of here.

441
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:19,919
I'll send your
personal effects later.

442
00:28:19,953 --> 00:28:21,754
You ignore this,

443
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:25,257
and you're putting
the entire building in danger.

444
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:27,026
Bauer is a violent criminal.

445
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,396
Kate, I really am trying
to help you.

446
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,730
It's for the best.

447
00:28:55,895 --> 00:28:58,463
(Handcuffs clicking)

448
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:11,776
(Taser clicking, guard grunting)

449
00:29:15,681 --> 00:29:18,116
(Beeps)

450
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,394
(Phone line ringing)

451
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:32,330
(Phone rings)

452
00:29:32,364 --> 00:29:33,631
Jordan, it's me.

453
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,600
Where are you? I just heard

454
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:38,670
Navarro was having you escorted
out of the building.

455
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:40,905
Listen, I need you to find out
if anyone in this building has

456
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,607
a prior history
with Jack Bauer.

457
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:44,609
Personnel, detainees,
anybody.

458
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:46,644
Okay, I'm running
the cross-check.

459
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:48,746
I'll call you
if I find something.

460
00:29:48,781 --> 00:29:50,014
Okay, thanks.

461
00:29:58,724 --> 00:30:02,293
Erik: Used to study your
missions back in training.

462
00:30:02,328 --> 00:30:04,395
You were really
something, Bauer.

463
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:07,665
Back in the day.

464
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,567
(Keypad beeping)

465
00:30:11,137 --> 00:30:12,470
Dean, it's me.

466
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:17,542
I'll be right there.

467
00:30:24,483 --> 00:30:27,719
(Beeps)

468
00:30:29,722 --> 00:30:31,222
(Typing)

469
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,394
(Men grunting)

470
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:39,164
(Erik grunting)

471
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,584
(Grunts)

472
00:31:09,093 --> 00:31:10,894
Take me to her now.

473
00:31:24,776 --> 00:31:26,410
Hold on.

474
00:31:28,913 --> 00:31:30,547
You know who I am.

475
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:32,849
Trigger an alarm,
and I'll blow your head off.

476
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:35,786
Now open the door.

477
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:52,469
(Grunts loudly)

478
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:58,875
Did you do this to her?

479
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,444
It's nothing
you haven't done.

480
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,551
Come on. Chloe, wake up.

481
00:32:09,987 --> 00:32:11,221
Damn it.

482
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,103
(Panting)

483
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:31,141
(Gasps)

484
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:34,077
Easy. It's all right.
It's all right. Okay.

485
00:32:35,346 --> 00:32:36,780
Jack, what are you doing here?

486
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:38,949
We got to get out of here.

487
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:42,319
Come on. We gotta move.

488
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:50,394
You were right
about Bauer.

489
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:51,995
He does have a connection
with someone

490
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,296
being held
by Special Activities.

491
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:54,898
And please don't ask me how

492
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:57,401
I got into their system.
Who is it?

493
00:32:57,435 --> 00:33:00,437
Chloe O'Brian. She's one of
those free information hackers.

494
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:02,739
Sending this
to your phone now.

495
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:05,842
She was responsible
for releasing over 10,000

496
00:33:05,877 --> 00:33:07,844
classified dod files.

497
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:09,246
Is charged with treason.

498
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,015
She worked with Bauer
at CTU for years.

499
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,317
Served time for helping him
escape the country.

500
00:33:14,352 --> 00:33:15,986
Son of a bitch.

501
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,320
He's here
to break her out.

502
00:33:22,326 --> 00:33:26,296
I'm at Special Activities.

503
00:33:27,565 --> 00:33:29,499
Bauer's gone.

504
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:38,775
Erik and Brandon
are down but alive.

505
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,977
Listen, I want you to initiate
a level five lockdown.

506
00:33:41,012 --> 00:33:42,446
Do it on my authority.

507
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,114
You don't have
any authority!

508
00:33:44,148 --> 00:33:45,148
Just do it!

509
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:50,420
(Alarm blares)

510
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:55,959
What the hell is going on?
Why are we on lockdown?

511
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,494
Bauer's trying
to escape, sir.

512
00:33:57,528 --> 00:33:58,729
Kate's down there
right now.

513
00:33:58,763 --> 00:34:00,564
Kate?

514
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,248
Come on, Chloe.
You're gonna make it!

515
00:34:20,785 --> 00:34:23,186
I need you to take cover
behind that wall.

516
00:35:04,662 --> 00:35:07,064
(Alarm blares)

517
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:10,467
This way.

518
00:35:13,137 --> 00:35:15,038
Stay down here.
Stay down.

519
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:18,075
Bauer! You're done. You're
not getting out of here!

520
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:19,776
Drop your weapon!

521
00:35:19,811 --> 00:35:22,179
Drop it!

522
00:35:25,283 --> 00:35:28,452
Okay, now put your hands
behind your head.

523
00:35:28,486 --> 00:35:30,921
Come on. Put your hands
behind your head.

524
00:35:30,955 --> 00:35:32,089
Do it.

525
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,293
Where's O'Brian?

526
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,465
(Beeping)

527
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,314
Come on, Chloe.

528
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:09,116
Belcheck.

529
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:10,451
You got her?

530
00:36:10,485 --> 00:36:12,153
Yeah.

531
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:15,790
(Kate coughing)

532
00:36:15,824 --> 00:36:17,858
(Gasps)

533
00:36:17,893 --> 00:36:19,894
Come on. Come on.

534
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,501
We gotta go.
Get down! Get down!

535
00:36:34,743 --> 00:36:35,609
Go!

536
00:37:06,908 --> 00:37:09,843
I just love this city.

537
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:11,745
You can feel the history.

538
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:15,742
And I know that look.

539
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,019
What's your problem?

540
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:22,589
The mistake you made
in your meeting.

541
00:37:22,623 --> 00:37:25,549
Mark said it was nothing...

542
00:37:25,857 --> 00:37:28,128
That I shouldn't worry.

543
00:37:33,683 --> 00:37:37,804
It's progressing a lot quicker
than the doctors anticipated.

544
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,049
It's terrifying,

545
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:52,185
the thought
of slowly losing yourself.

546
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:55,322
Not just the memories,

547
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,324
but all of it.

548
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:01,294
What do you want to do?

549
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:02,796
Right now,

550
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,831
I want to lock up

551
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,801
this treaty
with the British.

552
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:10,237
Okay.

553
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:12,806
Don't say anything
to Mark.

554
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,776
I'll speak to him
when the time's right.

555
00:38:23,818 --> 00:38:26,219
(Electrical crackling)

556
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,927
Running recovery protocols.

557
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:35,195
It's gonna be at least
20 minutes before I can try

558
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,997
and access local cctv
to look for Bauer.

559
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:38,865
All right, let me know
as soon as we're back up.

560
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,667
Yes, sir.
We're laying down a search grid,

561
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:42,536
starting with a ten-block perimeter,
activating off-duty agents.

562
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,838
You're not gonna find him.

563
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:47,674
Thanks for the confidence.

564
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:50,644
Look at how he planned this.
He knows our protocols, he knows

565
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:52,045
the layout of this facility,

566
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,614
he even knows that special
activities keeps the identity

567
00:38:54,649 --> 00:38:55,816
of their prisoners classified.

568
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,217
So what do you suggest,
we just give up?

569
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,518
I want everything that

570
00:38:58,553 --> 00:38:59,987
Special Activities has
on Chloe O'Brian.

571
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:01,521
We track down
her known associates,

572
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:04,191
we break down the intel
for where she might go.

573
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:05,559
There's no "we."

574
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,728
You are not part
of this station anymore.

575
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,463
Can I talk to you alone, please?

576
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:10,697
Sir...

577
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,169
Make sure local fire and police
follow our security protocols.

578
00:39:16,204 --> 00:39:17,738
And if they give you

579
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,307
any trouble, remind them
we've got consular status.

580
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:21,241
Sir...

581
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,743
Do it.

582
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,078
Look at what Jack did,
and he was here for how long?

583
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,647
Look, we need to find him.
So let me do it.

584
00:39:27,682 --> 00:39:28,982
Put me back in the field.

585
00:39:29,017 --> 00:39:30,417
You have to understand,

586
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,419
I am under a microscope here,
all right?

587
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,887
The president's chief of staff

588
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:36,089
is already all over me
about Bauer.

589
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,191
And I'm your best shot
at getting him back.

590
00:39:38,226 --> 00:39:41,395
Look, yes, Adam was a traitor,
and I missed it,

591
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:43,230
but I didn't miss this.
I'm the only one

592
00:39:43,264 --> 00:39:45,332
who saw it coming.
I got inside Bauer's head.

593
00:39:45,366 --> 00:39:46,933
Nobody else did that.
Not Erik,

594
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,502
and not even you.

595
00:39:48,536 --> 00:39:51,538
And if you think the chief of
staff is up your ass right now,

596
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:53,407
imagine what he's gonna do
when he finds out

597
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:55,976
that you had a heads up on this
and you dismissed it.

598
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,414
Kate, are you threatening me?

599
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:04,785
I can do this, okay?
I can find Bauer.

600
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:09,256
I'm asking you to let me.

601
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:27,841
Belcheck, pull over
at the end of the block.

602
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,150
Chloe, Chloe,
look at me.

603
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,919
Are you all right?

604
00:40:38,953 --> 00:40:40,821
Yeah. Okay, good, 'cause
we need to move fast.

605
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,957
Take this phone. It's gonna be
secure for at least an hour.

606
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:46,460
They're gonna mobilize after me,
so we need to separate.

607
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:47,794
Can you get somewhere safe?

608
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:49,629
Chloe?!

609
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,431
Can you get somewhere safe?

610
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:52,299
I think so.

611
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:53,967
Okay, good. I will find you

612
00:40:54,002 --> 00:40:57,337
on that cell phone
as soon as I'm secure.

613
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,440
Now we gotta go, okay?
Now come on.

614
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,315
You got a signal
from the transmitter

615
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:10,350
that we put
in her phone?

616
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:14,654
Yes. I still think you should
have just asked her to help.

617
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:17,157
I couldn't take
the chance she'd say no.

618
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:18,959
I thought you said
she was your friend.

619
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,231
I don't have any friends.

620
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:27,801
Let's go.

621
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,301
D-11-3, angels five,
all clear.

622
00:42:01,336 --> 00:42:03,870
Mission complete.
Moving on to next assignment.

623
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:05,339
Turning South.

624
00:42:16,017 --> 00:42:18,719
Wait. What? What is this?

625
00:42:21,856 --> 00:42:23,890
Wait.

626
00:42:25,393 --> 00:42:26,426
Oh, no, no!

627
00:42:27,395 --> 00:42:29,496
My God.

628
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,698
(Line ringing)

629
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:33,200
(Phone rings)

630
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:34,701
Major Shepherd.

631
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:36,937
Sir, you need to get away
from that vehicle!

632
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,005
You're being targeted!

633
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:41,174
What are you talking about?
Targeted by who?

634
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:43,410
Something's taking control
of my drone!

635
00:42:43,444 --> 00:42:45,112
It's armed a missile to attack!

636
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,279
What?

637
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,781
I don't understand it
either, sir,

638
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,117
but you need to get to cover
right now!

639
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,886
Get to cover now, sir!

640
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,955
Sir, move, move!

641
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,224
No! No!

642
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:36,596
It's done.

643
00:43:36,631 --> 00:43:40,167
