1
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,322
(distant sirens)

2
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,665
Man:
Well, it's not a matter of right and wrong.

3
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,701
It's a matter of righter and wronger.

4
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,942
Man #2:
Righter and wronger?

5
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:54,954
Those are not words, Carlo.

6
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,649
Carlo:
Hey, that's what the judge said.

7
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:00,216
The judge said that
in a court of law.

8
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,228
He said righter and wronger,
right there.

9
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,857
"Pledge of Allegiance,"
all that bullshit.

10
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,662
What else did the judge say?

11
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,069
He said that people will,

12
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,870
you know, protect their lives
no matter what.

13
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,139
I mean, he didn't say it like that.
You know, he said it like

14
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,511
the fancy legal shit, but... but yeah.

15
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,641
He said people will protect
their lives no matter what,

16
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,310
something like that.

17
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:28,877
You heard
about what happened, right?

18
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,215
On the Belt Parkway.
You heard that?

19
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,591
- No.
- Yeah, I was on the Belt Parkway,

20
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:37,823
- like 65th Street...
- You were on the Belt Parkway?

21
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:41,595
Yeah, down by the pier.
I'm driving like a bastard

22
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:46,037
and, you know,
fucking cops pull me over, right?

23
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,939
They give me the breath test.
You know, I'm drunk off my ass,

24
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,000
right, and they lock me up.

25
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,376
So before I go in front of the judge,

26
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,007
my lawyer, he says to me...

27
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,452
he says,
"You know, you were so drunk that...

28
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,183
that it's considered a felony."

29
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,555
- Which means I broke parole.
- Yeah.

30
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,685
That's seven years.

31
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,854
I mean, no lies, Sal...

32
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,421
l... I felt like I was gonna
shit a bowling ball.

33
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,858
So I finally go in front of the judge.

34
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,700
He goes, "Can you please
explain what happened?"

35
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,467
And I said,
"Your Honor, look.

36
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:24,136
I'm in a bar,
I'm having a drink, right?

37
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,975
These two fucking guys come in,
they assaulted me.

38
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,538
The bashed me, you know,
smashed bottles over my head.

39
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,641
Yeah, there's bottles over my head

40
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,481
and kicked me in the face.

41
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,216
And to save myself,
I got in my car...

42
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,520
you know, I ran out of there,
I got in my car,

43
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,186
- and, you know, I drove off."
- Right. And he bought that?

44
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,855
Yeah, well, he bought nothing.
That's a true story.

45
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,057
- I got no...
- Oh, come on.

46
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,225
Hey, that's a true story.

47
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,791
Okay.

48
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,735
All right.

49
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,897
Okay.

50
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,668
Yeah, I owed all these bookies

51
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,073
and back then I didn't have
nothing to pay them, you know.

52
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,511
So somebody
in the bar called the cops.

53
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,205
But the judge,
he's listening to this

54
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,241
and he's...

55
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,380
you know, he looks like
he's gonna shit a bowling ball.

56
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,982
(laughs)

57
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:16,155
He says that this is not a simple case
of right and wrong,

58
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,131
but righter and wronger.

59
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,623
Because the defendant had
to break the law...

60
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,137
to protect his own life.

61
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,003
It's un-fucking-believable.

62
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,901
What happened to the cops?

63
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,176
Nothing. They were right
even though they were wrong.

64
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,311
And I was wrong
only because that I was right.

65
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:41,877
You see? You get that now.

66
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,352
- You get that, right?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,484
- Righter and wronger.
- Righter and wronger.

68
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,757
That's right.

69
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,426
- You're too much.
- You see what I'm...

70
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,457
(gunshot)

71
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,492
(panting)

72
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,632
(gags)

73
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:47,387
- (gasps)
- (alarm clock buzzing)

74
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,218
- (gasps)
- (alarm clock buzzing)

75
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,424
(turns off alarm)

76
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,135
(gun clicks)

77
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,949
(distant siren)

78
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,862
(distant siren)

79
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,069
(chattering)

80
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,015
(fire truck honking)

81
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,418
- (tires screech)
- Yo, Tango!

82
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,320
We got that shit on deck!

83
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,915
(tires screech)

84
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,950
- (man shouting)
- (woman crying)

85
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,590
Man: Hey, get your
motherfucking hands off me!

86
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,033
(police radio chatter)

87
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,039
Reporter:
Still very active here at the BK projects.

88
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,871
Details are sketchy,
but here's what we know.

89
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,810
A young African-American man
named Allen Daniels

90
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,143
was allegedly shot
and killed by police.

91
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,479
We're hearing
it was one police officer

92
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,712
who was trying to rob him.

93
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,482
- (crying) He's a good boy.
- It's gonna be okay, all right?

94
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,649
- He's a good boy!
- Reporter: Residents here are

95
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,126
- obviously outraged...
- My boy! My boy!

96
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,705
(alarm chirps)

97
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,302
- Let's just kick it, man.
- Let's go.

98
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,405
Y'all little niggas know
what to do. Hurry up.

99
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,974
It's hot out this motherfucker.
There's police everywhere.

100
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,077
Yo, hurry up.

101
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,180
Yo, it's crazy right now.
What happened?

102
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,555
Tango. Come here, man.
Lemme holla at you real quick.

103
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,418
I thought you was
going back to school, B.

104
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,453
Come on, Tango.
What they gonna teach me

105
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,362
in there I ain't
already learning out here?

106
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,060
But you're gonna make
that court date, right?

107
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,227
Come on, Tango.
You know I'm gonna make the court date.

108
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,736
- You know I'm gonna make the court date.
- All right. Cool.

109
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,331
- What's going on here?
- Yo, these fucking pigs, man.

110
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,206
They done clap a little homey, man.
Shit crazy right now, boy.

111
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:58,835
- Word?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,108
- (siren continues)
- (chattering continues)

113
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,586
Check it.
I don't wanna hear

114
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,787
y'all been spending y'all gwap
on these hookers either. You heard?

115
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,125
Wake up in the morning with
your dick looking like a trophy

116
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,790
with the mother.
Ask K Rock.

117
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:21,697
You know bitches be burning this shit.

118
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,725
Come on, man.
You better stop telling people.

119
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,294
We gonna go in the living room
and fuck with the PlayStation real quick.

120
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,466
Let me see you pop verse two, son.

121
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,772
- What up, Tang.
- What's up, man?

122
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,710
Man:
But yo, truthfully, man,

123
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,770
you know that was
you and your cousin that got shot.

124
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,281
- Man #2: Word up.
- Man: Stretched out.

125
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,842
- Three shots in the chest.
- Police are crazy. Wild.

126
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,877
(sirens blaring)

127
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,885
(woman crying)
Oh God!

128
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,051
Oh God!

129
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,884
Sal:
I did a bad thing...

130
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,149
but to a bad guy.

131
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,752
A very very bad guy, all right?

132
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,490
And for a good reason.

133
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,396
You think that's
a rationalization, right?

134
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,299
That's what you're thinking.

135
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,531
You're here.

136
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,335
So you've prayed for guidance.

137
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,935
No, I couldn't do that.

138
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,775
Priest: Why not?

139
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:45,182
'Cause prayers were
not gonna give me what I needed.

140
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,718
Is that more important
than your relationship with God?

141
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,950
No matter what you may have done...

142
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,661
- He's ready to forgive you.
- He is, huh?

143
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,561
We're all imperfect creatures...

144
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:02,163
and we're led to sin.

145
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,193
That's why we have to
surrender our souls to God.

146
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,433
Well, to be honest with you,

147
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,034
I've been here before, all right,

148
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,170
asking for God's help

149
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,646
a lot of times, okay?

150
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:19,640
And my situation is not getting
any sunnier, you know?

151
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:24,088
So... so why should it now?

152
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,615
Your pride is denying
the possibility of God's goodness.

153
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,651
Why does He get all the glory?

154
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,754
You know, why is that?

155
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,994
Huh? He gets all the glory
and I get all the blame.

156
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,061
I mean, is it not possible...

157
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:42,541
(whispers) that maybe God
isn't carrying His end of the weight?

158
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,010
Look. This thing is
obviously weighing on you.

159
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,143
So release it.

160
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,445
Confess your sin.

161
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,042
Pray for forgiveness.

162
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:56,111
I don't want God's forgiveness.

163
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,920
I want His fucking help.

164
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,763
What? Is that so hard?

165
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,993
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

166
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,731
Let's just... let's do a few
"Hail Mary"s and go, okay?

167
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,365
Let's... thank you.
Thank you.

168
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,535
This has been really good.
Thank you.

169
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,803
"Hail Mary, full of grace,

170
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,815
the Lord is with thee;
blessed art thou amongst women,

171
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,510
and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

172
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,178
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

173
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:29,779
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death. Amen."

174
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,651
Thank you.

175
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,626
- Sal.
- (footsteps recede)

176
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:47,873
All right, everybody.
Listen up. Give me your ears.

177
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,034
All right, everybody.
Listen up. Give me your ears.

178
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,943
The BK projects,
you all know it.

179
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,970
18 buildings, 15,000 residents.

180
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:59,576
The highest crime area
in the highest crime precinct.

181
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,587
Good morning, Sal.
Thanks for joining us.

182
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,885
Larceny, rape, prostitution...

183
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,858
it even takes the crown for kidnapping.

184
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,985
- It's estimated that over...
- Yo.

185
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,962
- What do you hear? What do you say?
- Not too much.

186
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,362
Oh, fuck.

187
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,095
Hey, what do you know about...

188
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,831
what's his name? ...Bobby Powers
with CI? You hear about that?

189
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,270
- Carlo?
- Yeah.

190
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,001
Found him with his face blown off

191
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,838
in a Town Car over by the cemetery.

192
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,004
Oh. They got any leads on that?

193
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:31,142
Carlo was a grade A asshole.
Everyone's a lead. Why?

194
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,947
No, nothing.
It's just... you know.

195
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,752
And now, the media
shovelling shit on our badges

196
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,417
over the shooting
that took place there.

197
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,655
We have to remind the public
that one man from this unit

198
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,220
cannot stain
the sum total of our efforts;

199
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,200
That we are not in the business
of harming the public but of helping it.

200
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,466
We've been entrusted
with the responsibility to protect

201
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,440
- those who cannot protect themselves.
- (door opens, slams)

202
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,671
This is where
we accomplish that, gentlemen.

203
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,311
Hey, Eddie, what are you doing here?
The bars close early?

204
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,214
I heard you let
another cuffed perp escape.

205
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,718
What's that, about six now?

206
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,513
Is he fucking laughing at you?

207
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,956
- Laughing? Are you laughing at me?
- I'll just slap your fucking mouth.

208
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,324
- Whoa whoa!
- I just wanna talk to him.

209
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,522
- No, just... don't...
- Are you laughing at me, man?

210
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,191
Forget about him. Come on.
Forget about him. Come on.

211
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,393
Fucking burn out, man.

212
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,062
- (snorts)
- Nobody want you here, man.

213
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,799
Let's go.
Hey, you got my fucking "Playboy"?

214
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,830
- That's my "Playboy."
- That's mine.

215
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:31,866
- You boys starting trouble?
- No, Captain. No, sir.

216
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,379
(phone rings)

217
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,610
Dugan.
See me in my office.

218
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,117
Five minutes.

219
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,152
Eddie:
I forget to fill something out?

220
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,630
Captain: Everything went fine.
Retirement's gone through.

221
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,326
Eddie: Great.

222
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,231
Captain:
How are you doing, Eddie?

223
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,337
(Eddie sighs)

224
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,134
You know.

225
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,368
Captain:
The wife?

226
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,434
Eddie:
You know.

227
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,776
Captain: Here's the deal.
Our commissioner,

228
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,372
he believes in this new program

229
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,283
that puts rookie cops
in the highest crime areas.

230
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,810
So they want
seasoned hairbags like you

231
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,686
breaking these recruits in.

232
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,953
Since you're the oldest here...

233
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,517
Hey, look,
if it's all the same to you,

234
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,222
I've got seven days.

235
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,723
I'm no one's teacher.

236
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,100
I'm not a role model.

237
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,330
God knows you're not, Eddie,

238
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,805
but your name came up
in the computer, pal.

239
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,240
This thing's been kicked up
by two months

240
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,766
and all eyes are on it.

241
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,678
Just do the best you can, okay?

242
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,775
Come on, Dugan.
Don't you want to do something useful

243
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,877
with your last two minutes on the job?

244
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,950
Not really.

245
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,354
(sighs)

246
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,006
(doo-wop music playing)

247
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,682
What the fuck, Clarence?
I've been nursing this seat for 15 minutes.

248
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,247
Don't call me Clarence.

249
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,860
You order for me yet?

250
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,661
Yeah, pancakes, eggs and bacon.

251
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,328
- I told you...
- I know. I remembered turkey bacon.

252
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,064
I know that you don't eat the swine.

253
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,472
All right.
The drugs are in play.

254
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,066
All the principles are accounted for.

255
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,974
I haven't made contact
with the connect yet.

256
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,911
Again with Jersey, huh?

257
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,973
Fuck those racist crackers, man.

258
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,883
You know how they do, Bill.
Black man, black car,

259
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,149
profiling shit.

260
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,418
What am I supposed to do?
Just cave into them?

261
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,350
I played that shit perfectly.

262
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:04,726
In all fairness there was
20 bricks of raw in the trunk.

263
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,560
Yeah?
Well, they didn't know that.

264
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:10,261
It's called tact.
You know what tact is, right?

265
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,236
I don't wanna play games
with you, Bill, all right?

266
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,365
Now you need to push harder
about me making grade.

267
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,204
- Talk to the chief.
- I know.

268
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,732
It's not like you haven't earned it.
You've earned it.

269
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,745
But it's just, I've told you,
these things, they take...

270
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,679
Time.
You keep saying that shit,

271
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,615
but you know that
I've put in more than e-fucking-nough.

272
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,550
What's happening?

273
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:30,419
What's going on? Why is this
all of a sudden so urgent, huh?

274
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,591
When that trooper
pulled us over last night...

275
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,156
- (siren blaring)
...he gets me out of the car

276
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,795
and he's doing
his whole Gestapo bit, right?

277
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,397
My man and thems
in the car are ready.

278
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,997
Shotgun, he's on high alert.

279
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,236
Kid in the back, he's locked,
cocked and ready to rock.

280
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,868
- I ain't going back to jail.
- No, man, hold it. Hold it.

281
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,812
- No no no.
- I'm dying to bust my guns, man.

282
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,406
You know I can't stand
these motherfuckers.

283
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,145
Tango: This guy has no fucking idea
what's about to go down.

284
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,176
- (taps on window)
- Tango: You know what I'm thinking?

285
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,382
"Fuck it."

286
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,019
- (siren blares)
- "Let it be."

287
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,355
And then we get back to the Ps,

288
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:16,300
and I see the young brother
laid out on the concrete

289
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,132
and I find out how...

290
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,264
Next time you're on my road,

291
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,706
knock the speeding off.

292
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,108
I don't give a damn who you are.

293
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,909
...I start thinking, "We should've just
deaded them motherfuckers on the road.

294
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,744
It'd have been two to one,
but so what?

295
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,375
I'm good with those odds.
Fuck it."

296
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,244
You see what I'm saying?

297
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,189
I'm fucked up in the game, man.
You've got to get me out of here.

298
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,725
I'm gonna keep greasing the wheel
for you, see what we can do, okay?

299
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:46,356
Desk, suit, tie.

300
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,889
It's just something I need, okay?

301
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:51,061
I need that shit like water.

302
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,698
Can you look at something for me?

303
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,304
The kid you saw killed in the projects...

304
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,179
it gets worse.
He was an honor student,

305
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,515
a grad student.

306
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:11,080
The cop who shot him
was trying to rob him.

307
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,853
So of course when
the major newspapers get ahold of this,

308
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:16,087
the shit's really gonna hit the fan,
if you know what I mean.

309
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,062
Please tell me they caught
the son of a bitch.

310
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,555
Yeah, we caught him,
but the bosses are gonna wanna find

311
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,932
some kind of thing
that's gonna clean this up pronto.

312
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,800
So there's gonna be
some kind of play that goes down.

313
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,272
Some kind of play is gonna happen.
I don't know what it's gonna be,

314
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:31,572
but I need to know... I need to know
you're my boy out there.

315
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,170
- Oh, I'm your boy, huh?
- You know that's not what I meant.

316
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,013
You get in touch with Allisa?

317
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,555
(sighs)

318
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,891
L... she sent these.

319
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,226
They're divorce papers.

320
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,131
You know, I've got some lawyers'
names in there for you, a list of them.

321
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:59,228
I've got the department taking care
of everything for you, okay?

322
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,398
(cup clatters)

323
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,414
I want my life back, Bill.

324
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,148
I can see that,
and I'm working on it.

325
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,258
Please. Work harder.

326
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,453
(siren blaring)

327
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,031
The captain says you're retiring.

328
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,331
(radio chatter)

329
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,304
What did you say your name was?

330
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,007
Melvin Panton...
Lance Corporal, US Marines.

331
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,951
Marines.

332
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:53,321
Well, Lance Corporal Melvin Panton...

333
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,560
seven days from today

334
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,962
is 22 years for me.

335
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,762
Pension doesn't get
any better after that.

336
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,860
Seven days from today?

337
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,564
That's... that's my birthday.

338
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,039
You've been a cop
longer than I've been alive.

339
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,565
Ain't that something?

340
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,811
I can see you're married... the ring.

341
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,341
Separated.

342
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:27,080
You know, I've always wanted
to be on the force my whole life.

343
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,093
Yeah, it's true.

344
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:33,029
I had plastic handcuffs
when I was three.

345
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,130
Yeah, every Halloween

346
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,864
I always dressed as a cop.

347
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,395
(distant siren)

348
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,533
I bet you find that
pretty corny, right?

349
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,409
But hey, I'm here now.

350
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,379
(man and woman arguing)

351
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,153
- Wait here.
- Woman: You know what? Fuck you.

352
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,956
Don't touch or do anything.
You got it?

353
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,569
Man: Stop it with the fingers
to the fucking face, all right?

354
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,436
Woman: Oh, yeah? What are
you gonna do? What are you gonna do?

355
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,670
Man: I'm gonna cut 'em right off.
Stop it with the fucking fingers.

356
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,540
- Every fucking...
- You'd better back down.

357
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,239
- Every fucking time you do that.
- You'd better fucking back down.

358
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,804
Get out of my face.
Get out of my face.

359
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,475
- Ah!
- All right, how about that?

360
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,916
- You're always talking to these guys.
- Woman: I ain't doing nothing.

361
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,613
- Man: Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not doing... I was shopping!

362
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,350
You know what? You're fucking pissing...
don't you fucking start with me.

363
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,119
- Man: Get your finger out of my face.
- Don't start with me!

364
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,150
- All right? Get your finger...
- Hey! Hey hey hey hey, enough!

365
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,957
- Take a step back.
- Get the fuck outta here.

366
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,896
- I'm gonna ask you one more time...
- Who the fuck are you?

367
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,764
- All right, that's it. You're under arrest.
- That's good. That's okay.

368
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,567
Walk... walk... walk away. Walk away.
Walk away. What did I tell you?

369
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,971
- I said don't do anything, just sit there.
- He just hit her, man.

370
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,703
Hey, this is 64th Precinct.

371
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,472
We are what?
What are we?

372
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:54,945
- 65.
- 65th, right.

373
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,540
Was it Halloween that day
at the academy?

374
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,243
What the fuck is wrong with you?

375
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,048
You do not make
an arrest out of zone.

376
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,816
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

377
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,415
- Eddie. Eddie, it is...
- We'll talk about it in the car.

378
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,449
- You...
- Get in the car.

379
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,826
- (door closes)
- Uh-huh.

380
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:16,527
Happy days are here again.

381
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,559
(coins jingle)

382
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,140
(phone ringing)

383
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,544
You've reached Allisa.
I can't come to the phone right...

384
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,571
(coins clink)

385
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,953
Hey! Yo.

386
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:40,321
- Hey, calm down.
- Get the fuck away from my car.

387
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,119
Get a real fucking job, man.

388
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:52,002
- (engine starts)
- (tires screech)

389
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,241
Well, what if you turn on
the news tonight and she's dead?

390
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:00,176
- Hmm?
- I don't watch the news.

391
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,238
- It's depressing.
- You just...

392
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,952
You're just gonna act
like this never happened?

393
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,822
This is your first day, kid.

394
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,293
Today a woman gets hit.
Tomorrow it's a rape.

395
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,296
The day after that it's a murder.

396
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,525
- Dad! Dad!
- What's up, Dad?

397
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,090
Eddie:
You've got 20 years of days.

398
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:26,536
This job takes enough out of you.
Don't take it home.

399
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,871
In my book, that's called a coward.

400
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:42,046
Yeah, well,
I'm not much of a reader either.

401
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,195
- I'll eat in the car.
- Yeah, good.

402
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,220
Good idea.

403
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,505
Seven days, Eddie.
Seven days.

404
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,616
- You're the one that always...
- Shut up.

405
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,621
- You're asking him.
- You ask him.

406
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,123
You ask him.
You do it. Okay.

407
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,556
- Hey, Dad.
- Dad. Hey, Dad, Dad, Dad.

408
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,389
- Dad, turtle turtle...
- What did I tell you?

409
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,988
- What did I tell him about the turtle?
- You can't get a turtle until you get a room.

410
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,022
That's right. So now you go to
the pet store

411
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,557
and pick out two turtles, 'cause you boys
are gonna have your own room.

412
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,035
- Boys: Really?!
- Sal: Yes.

413
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,766
- Boy: Yeah!
- (boys cheer)

414
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,036
- Sal: Dad here looking for a princess.
- (door closes)

415
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:39,635
There she is.
There she is.

416
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,612
What are you doing, huh?
What are you doing?

417
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,638
- Look what I made.
- Oh, yeah? What is it? Is that me?

418
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,275
- Yeah.
- Is my head that big?

419
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,047
- Yeah.
- You better say no. You better say no.

420
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,883
Where's your mother, huh?
Where is she?

421
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,388
- No, where is she in real life?
- Angela: Sal.

422
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,790
- Go get her.
- Mom! Dad's home!

423
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,753
(kids chattering)

424
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,348
This is not enough, man.
What's this...

425
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,979
this is not enough.
This is not enough.

426
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,455
- This is... fuck!
- Angela: Watch your language!

427
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,856
What are you doing down there?
Come on, we're waiting for you.

428
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,554
No, l... fuck.

429
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,500
Sal, what are you doing?

430
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,215
Sal.

431
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,219
- (glass shatters)
- Boy: Mom!

432
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,556
- What?
- Vicky dropped a glass.

433
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,391
- Coming.
- Vicky: I didn't do it, Vinny did.

434
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:07,557
Angela: Come on, Sal.
Don't touch the glass.

435
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,590
(kids arguing)

436
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,173
(sighs)

437
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:20,979
(chattering)

438
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,810
(chattering)

439
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,679
(hip-hop music playing)

440
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,616
(woman giggles)

441
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,619
Hello.

442
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,098
Hi, Tango.
(giggles)

443
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:50,232
Yeah, bro.
Look at what's behind you.

444
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,343
Better watch where
you're fucking walking, man.

445
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:02,615
- Who the fuck is you talking to?
- I'm talking to you, motherfucker.

446
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,019
Just watch where
the fuck you're walking.

447
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,546
Nlgga, you'd better watch
where the fuck you living

448
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,058
if you want to keep living.

449
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,561
- Man: Whoa whoa whoa.
- Watch your mouth.

450
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,085
"Watch your mouth"?
You'd better watch your grill.

451
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,995
Guard your grill, motherfucker.
You might get it slapped.

452
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,057
What you wanna do?
You the one getting all fucking froggy.

453
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,864
- Jump, motherfucker.
- What you wanna do, motherfucker?

454
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,392
What the fuck I'm gonna do?
What you gonna do?

455
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,405
Yeah, I'm right here too, motherfucker.
Jump.

456
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,906
- You jump, nigga.
- What? Throw some bows.

457
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,272
Blink, motherfucker.
Blink blink blink!

458
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,607
(both laughing)

459
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,207
- Tango!
- Dude!

460
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,080
Welcome back.
Welcome back.

461
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,881
Look at you,
all swollen up and everything.

462
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,046
- Come on, man. Come on.
- What? You trying to look hard?

463
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,453
You trying to look tough, huh?

464
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,788
That shit almost got you shanked up
in Clinton, you know?

465
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,918
Oh, well, look.
They carried one

466
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,826
and one walked away, nigga.

467
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,127
The one you see standing in front
of you right now on his own two.

468
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,032
True true true.
That's the way it's supposed to be.

469
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,559
Yeah, but you wouldn't have
air in your lungs if it wasn't for me.

470
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:55,266
- Now that's real talk.
- You feel that?

471
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,638
My man.

472
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,803
You know the fam.
On the strength,

473
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,244

474
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:07,751
when we was up,
this motherfucker did his thing.

475
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:10,050
Believe that.

476
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,885
Held it down up there.

477
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,914
Gonna hold it down out here.

478
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,984
- But now the general home.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

479
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,656
We gonna celebrate like it's 1999.

480
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,064
- Uh-huh. Salute it, baby.
- Here you go, baby.

481
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,159
- Welcome home, baby!
- Yeah. Welcome home, C.

482
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,568
- Welcome home.
- (chattering)

483
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,164
Jack it up.
Ripple getting crazy.

484
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,903
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- All right.

485
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,878
Baby, we woulda trooped up
and come and got you but...

486
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:38,246
Listen. You know them police think that
"bird of a feather" shit, right?

487
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,308
They see you rolling around
with this motherfucker, man,

488
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:43,047
it gonna be like you back
on the throne the first day.

489
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,680
Which is why I had
this plan for the business.

490
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,350
- We gonna shake...
- Red. Red. Red. Red.

491
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,586
- What, bro?
- First day back,

492
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,787
my man ain't trying to hear
all that business shit. It's a party.

493
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,490
A'ight, T,
you the party planner, man.

494
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,964
That's right.
I'm the motherfucking party planner.

495
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,797
I'll be festive for you, baby.

496
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,361
- Appreciate it.
- Yo, Tango. Lemme holla at you for a sec.

497
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,032
Yo yo, hold it down.
Keep it tight.

498
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,168
Eight years.

499
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,112
Eight years
and ain't a damn thing changed.

500
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,808
Tango:
Like them threads, B.

501
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,613
Did they, like, keep this for you?
You know you going with this.

502
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:16,779
- They kept this shit for you, pressed it...
- Oh, you got jokes, right?

503
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,652
Oh, you got jokes.
You a comedian now.

504
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,317
- No, you looking good, B.
- It looks all right?

505
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,950
No, you look good,
cat daddy. For real.

506
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,291
- Got this watch and shit.
- Oh, that shit is it, yeah.

507
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,990
How do you work that?
I don't even know how to work all this.

508
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,157
I just put the bling on.
You know I'm a knock.

509
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,635
- Shit. I can hardly tell time, B.
- (chuckles)

510
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:34,661
Oh, man.
My man Tango.

511
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,936
Mmm.

512
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,375
(sighs)

513
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,401
I talked to Rodrigo about you, man.

514
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,040
- Word?
- Yeah.

515
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,880
Why don't you link up?
I'll hit you with the digits later.

516
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:50,149
Yeah. Well, let me holla
at the connect. Cool, man.

517
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,621
But he told me, though.

518
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:55,387
He said y'all motherfuckers
moving some weight.

519
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:58,452
Oh, yeah, B.
Bringing that shit in 90% pure.

520
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:01,158
- (exhales deeply)
- Step on that shit like Gregory Hines, man.

521
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,793
It's still gonna outlast everybody's.

522
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,302
They have to change
the bus routes, man,

523
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,930
so many smokers flying over here
trying to get this product.

524
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,270
This a monster right now.

525
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,766
We clearing like 50 thou' a day.

526
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,110
Oh. 50. 50?

527
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,411
On a bad day.

528
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,576
Ooh.

529
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,519
My man Tango.

530
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,147
(chuckles)

531
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,590
You always were smarter
than the average motherfucker.

532
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,786
(chuckles)

533
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,997
But on the strength, though,

534
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,972
I just wanna say thank you, man.

535
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,601
The lawyer you turned me onto...

536
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,702
shit, I don't know
what that motherfucker did,

537
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,736
but whatever it was...

538
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,749
I wouldn't have won
that appeal if it wasn't for him.

539
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,651
- Oh, man, that was nothing.
- Nothing?

540
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,688
Bullshit.

541
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,920
Yo, man, I've been running
with Red and them...

542
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,157
I ran with them motherfuckers
since free lunch,

543
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,130
and not one...

544
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,225
not one of them motherfuckers
came to see me, man.

545
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:13,829
Not a card, not a visit,
not a magazine.

546
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,806
Nothing.

547
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,975
You different though, man.

548
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:24,004
Motherfuckers don't understand
what it's like being incarcerated.

549
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,107
You know
you fresh out of the bing

550
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,209
when you use words
like "incarcerated."

551
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,244
(both chuckle)

552
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,848
I'm edumacated now, man.

553
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,562
- (fire engine honking)
- (siren blaring)

554
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,863
It's just good to know we got
some real fam out there, man.

555
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,994
- No doubt, man. You fam.
- Thank you.

556
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,434
Yeah yeah yeah.

557
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,945
- I'm out, baby! I'm out!
- Yes, good to see you back, baby.

558
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,139
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, Mom.

559
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,704
No video games.
Keep it down. Keep it down.

560
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,512
No video games.

561
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,847
Vinny:
Fine, okay.

562
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,853
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

563
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,048
Mrs. Vincent called.

564
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,956
- She said, "Where's the deposit?"
- "Where's the deposit?"

565
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,789
- "I need the deposit. Where is it?"
- (both laugh)

566
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,852
No, I'll call her tomorrow.

567
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,593
I thought... I thought... I thought
that wasn't gonna work out.

568
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:17,624
What? No.
No, there was a problem,

569
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,502
but every problem's
an opportunity, right?

570
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:25,700
Yeah. I just don't want you to build it up
too much for the kids, you know?

571
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,473
Oh shit, though. Did you see?
Oh, you should've...

572
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,140
Vinny and Vito when I told them
when I came in,

573
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,206
they were... they light up.

574
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:36,414
Oh. Yeah, we've been down
this road before though, you know?

575
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,786
No, we haven't.
We haven't been down this road.

576
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,688
Yeah, get their hopes up...
the swimming pool.

577
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,216
- Don't...
- I don't mean to be negative, but...

578
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:46,424
You don't mean to be negative,
but, you know... pop!

579
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,364
- (both laugh)
- No, it's...

580
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,061
it's gonna be all right, okay?
I promise you.

581
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:54,128
- I absolutely promise you.
- I just think you should keep it...

582
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,969
- (click teeth) till it's, you know?
- No.

583
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,134
- No, this is not like before.
- Yeah, I do.

584
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,541
It is not like... come on, look at this.

585
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:02,239
This is our house.
We belong here.

586
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,840
Look at this.
Right here you have a little pool

587
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,850
for a little turtle for Mr. Vinny.

588
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,011
All right, over here you have
a little garden for Vicky.

589
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,851
And in here is the kitchen.
You've seen the kitchen, right?

590
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,221
- Yeah.
- Oh, this kitchen's gonna knock you out.

591
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,123
- Sal, I don't... Sal. Sal.
- You know, they've got this great...

592
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,355
- Sal, I believe you.
- No, you don't believe me.

593
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,956
Sal. Sal, you tell me
the sky's purple,

594
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,933
I'm gonna believe you, okay?

595
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,958
(coughing)

596
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,197
- Did you go to the doctor today?
- Yes.

597
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,503
- Yeah? What did he say?
- Yeah, l... yeah, I feel worse,

598
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,338
you know, and I should feel better

599
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,969
- than I do.
- (both laugh)

600
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,843
He goes on and on. It's just...

601
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,077
Yeah, well, you're still not
telling me what he said.

602
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,847
- Yeah, I know, 'cause you know why?
- Why?

603
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,889
'Cause I got dizzy... twice.

604
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:48,483
Oh, fuck. You're getting dizzy spells?
You're getting dizzy spells

605
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,788
- and you're not telling me?
- A little bit.

606
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:52,352
Angie, you cannot do that.
You've gotta tell me.

607
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,798
Okay? 'Cause it's the fucking mold
in these walls.

608
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,960
That's what it is.
You know it is.

609
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,095
It gets to your asthma.
It goes into your lungs.

610
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,163
No no no, baby.
No no no.

611
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,606
You need a new house.
I'm calling Mrs. Vincent right now.

612
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,475
Sal, I don't need anything.
I really don't.

613
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,377
Just you, babe.

614
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,507
No, you need a new house, okay?

615
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,952
Somebody needs to take care of you,
and that somebody is me, okay?

616
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,804
- (door opens)
- Man: Yo, for real, son.

617

I've got a new spot.
Gonna get some more girls,

618
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,241

619
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:49,151

620
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,382
Man #2: I've got some bitches
up in Westchester too.

621
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,391
- Man: Oh, word?
- Look at this nasty ass ho.

622
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,519
You were giving her too much of that shit.
Yo, she can't handle that shit.

623
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,826
Check this out, bitch.
You'd better pull your shit together quick.

624
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,492
You understand? You don't get sick
unless I tell you to get sick.

625
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,558
(keys jingle)

626
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,399
What the fuck you looking at, trick?

627
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,929
- (woman moaning)
- Get your shit together.

628
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,067
(van door opens)

629
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,475
(woman groans)

630
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,074
(van door closes)

631
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,845
(lock clicks)

632
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,713
Chantel:
Oh, yeah, there you go.

633
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,949
There you go.

634
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,424
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

635
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:32,156
(moans)
That's right, baby.

636
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:35,757
Just relax. Yeah.

637
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,634
- Slower. Slower. Slower. Slower.

638
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,002

640
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,298
- Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

641
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,896
- Easy. Oh, yeah.

642
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,566
Oh, yeah, baby. Oh!

643
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,598
(both moaning)

644
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,111
(sniffs)

645
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:34,147
- Ah.
- (mirror clatters)

646
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,904
# One pill makes you larger #

647
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:59,645
# And one pill makes you small #

648
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:04,121
# And the ones
that mother gives you #

649
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,147
# Don't do anything at all... #

650
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,955
- Hey, Papi, can I ask you a question?
- (thunder rumbling)

651
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,189
(rain pattering)

652
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,761
Why you ain't got
no bullets in your gun?

653
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,966
Can I ask you something?

654
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:30,345
What do you see
when you look at me?

655
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:37,082
# Has given you the call #

656
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,112
# Call Alice... #

657
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,226
Yeah.

658
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,062
What's wrong, Papa?

659
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,998
You gonna speak up?

660
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,732
(clicks tongue)

661
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,037
Or do I have to suck it out of you?

662
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,805
Hmm? Come here.

663
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,870
Sit back.

664
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:07,873
# Go ask Alice #

665
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:12,048
# I think she'll know... #

666
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,061
Talk to me, Papi.

667
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,655
Mmm. Easy.

668
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:23,258
Easy easy easy easy easy.

669
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,500
(sighs)

670
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,698
Slow slow slow slow slow slow.

671
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:34,344
This kid... fucking kid...

672
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:37,074
easy easy easy.

673
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,674
- Just your tongue.
- (moans)

674
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:42,311
This fucking kid... this rookie prick,

675
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,447
that bullshit look in his eyes,

676
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,014
like Lancelot or something.

677
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,050
He's gonna fix everything,
fucking kid.

678
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,619
(sighs)

679
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,029
Like this is his only reason
for getting up in the morning.

680
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,829
Yes, right there.
Right there. Right there.

681
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:01,670
He doesn't know...

682
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:04,231
he don't know a mean
fucking universe out there.

683
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,004
Fuck yeah.

684
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,714
Children:
Now I lay me down to sleep.

685
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:18,120
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

686
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:22,592
If I should die before I wake,

687
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:26,756
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

688
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,560
Amen.

689
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,794
What do you do now?

690
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,203
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, you two.

691
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,070
I love you.

692
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,905
Love you too.

693
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,523
(distant siren)

694
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,695
(hip-hop music playing)

695
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,303
Yo, everything safee.

696
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,331
All right, hold it down.

697
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,242
Yo, J-Mill start wrapping them shits
like they're Christmas presents.

698
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,643
Get them things flying.

699
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,977
- Don't rush perfection.

703
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,716

704
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:35,192
Yo, it sunny out there or what?

705
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,962

706
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,698
Get the fuck out of here.

707
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,603
I mean it...

708
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,200
Come on, Jeb.
Just bring back that bread.

709
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,811
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

710
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,511
My niggas are fresh, man.

711
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,076
Fuck this shit, man.

712
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,020
I hate this stupid ass bullshit.

713
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,955
- Bitch ass nigga.
- That's bullshit.

714
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,457
Hold up, man.
Let me make sure.

715
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,756
It's cool outside, man.
I'm stepping out to the store.

716
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,694
All right. All right.

717
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,097
Niggas always talking shit.

718
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,933
Yo, man, get this goddamn
refrigerator out of here, man.

719
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,600
Hey, you're gonna take me right back
to where you came from

720
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,336
or I'm gonna blow your
motherfucking brain out.

721
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,968
You got that, Coolio?
You got it?

722
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:24,037
You gonna say a fucking word?
No. Yeah, that's right.

723
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,918
All right, go go go.

724
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:42,262
Flinch and I will blow out
the back of your fucking spine.

725
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,132
- Now open the door, bitch.
- You're gonna get me killed, man.

726
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,966
- Go!

727
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,235

- Oh shit!

728
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,301
- Get down on the ground!

729
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,609
- Go!

730
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,808
Don't fucking move.

731
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,749
Oh shit.
Oh shit.

732
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,843
Check the bathroom.
Check the bathroom.

733
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,878
Get inside there.
Make sure it's all clear.

734
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,219
Come on, get down.
Don't fucking move.

735
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,424
Here we go.
Police! Police!

736
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,592
Open the door.

738
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,095
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

739
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:23,538
Come on, I got this, man.

00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:29,139
Yo, come on.
Hurry up.

742
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,276
- Go go go!
- Hands where I can see 'em.

743
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,013
What the fuck are you doing
by the window? What the fuck?

744
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,645
Where's the money?
Are you hiding money?

745
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,020
Did you throw it out the window?
You're fucking lying to me.

746
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,752
- Are you lying to me?
- No, I'm not.

747
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,317
- Where is the fucking money?
- Ain't no money.

748
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,296
Somebody out there? Huh?
Who's that? Who's that?

749
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,993
Hey! Get the fuck down.
Get the fuck down.

750
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,195
Do not even fucking
look at me, asshole.

751
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,069
- The money's left the building.
- Sal, what are you doing, man?

752
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,074
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- The money's left the building.

753
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,810
(panting)

754
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,977
(horns honking)

755
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,212
(train rattling)

756
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,657
Stop!

757
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,356
- Hey!
- Aah!

758
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,494
Get off me!

759
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,527
(grunts)

760
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:30,005
- Do not fucking move.
- Get off me.

761
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,770
You hear me?
Do not fucking move.

762
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,882
Suspect got away.
Suspect got away.

763
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,646
- Please.
- Where's the money? Huh?

764
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:44,153
Where's the money?

765
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:47,157
What the fuck are you talking about?
I ain't got no money.

766
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,420
Don't got any money?

767
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,297
What are you running for
if you don't have any money?

768
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,028
I could have shot you
in the fucking back.

769
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,764
Get out of here. Get your shit and get
out of here before you get me in trouble.

770
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:04,365
What the fuck? Diapers?
What the fuck?

771
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,399
- Fuck! Holy shit!
- Shit.

772
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:10,942
Oh fuck.

773
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,570
- Hey, what's up?
- How you doing?

774
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:45,276
- That the botulism special?
- Hey, vamos, Tango.

775
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:55,152
Who's that at the table with Bill?

776
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,456
I don't even know, man.

777
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,863
Clarence... I mean Tango.
I'd like you to mean Special Agent...

778
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,432
Smith. Sit down, chief.

779
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:15,172
Smith comes in on all our big cases.

780
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,978
You've done some
very impressive work.

781
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,813
Got me promoted.

782
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,649
I thank you.

783
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,747
And my realtor really thanks you.

784
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:31,153
You want to tell me what I'm doing here?

785
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,925
You know,
when Washington got wind

786
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:37,422
of this dirty cop
shooting that grad student,

787
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,402
we had to step in.

788
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:42,166
A thing like that,
it messes people up.

789
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:45,004
They forget what side they're on.

790
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,772
They forget who the real enemy is.

791
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:51,110
Every now and then we've got
to come in and remind 'em.

792
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,586
Casanova Phillips.

793
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:02,716
Judge gave this scumbag
a get out of jail free card.

794
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,729
We want you to take that card away,

795
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,027
but we need evidence.

796
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:12,331
You put him on a deal
with our UCs and push it through.

797
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,894
Provide a location narco can hit.

798
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,999
Raid supplies the evidence
and I get myself a high profile arrest.

799
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,875
Yeah, well...

800
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,607
I respectfully decline your offer.

801
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,486
What the fuck is this?
You fucking kidding me?

802
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:37,020
How's Allisa your wife?

803
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,858
Oh, I'm sorry, that's soon
to be ex-wife, right?

804
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,024
Get out. Get out.

805
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:44,795
It's all right. Thank you.
Just give us a minute, please.

806
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,167
I heard she's remodeling your house.

807
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:50,037
On a cop's salary, huh?

808
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,371
You know, a whole lot of cash

809
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,072
has passed through your hands
over the last two years.

810
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,910
I ain't stole so much as a nickel

811
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,041
since I've been on the job.
You ain't got shit.

812
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,950
Oh, you do not want me to put
a microscope up your ass,

813
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,420
'cause if I do, I will keep looking
until I find something.

814
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,083
- Or you plant something?
- Watch that.

815
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,796
Now you listen to me.

816
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,924
You think you're a tough guy

817
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:19,163
'cause you did undercover
at Clinton Correctional?

818
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,603
You even survived a little incident.

819
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:23,731
If you know so much about me,

820
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:27,073
then maybe you should
stop fucking with me.

821
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,271
If you got a case, bring it.

822
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:33,875
But until that time, step off, dude.

823
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,516
Hey! Hey!
Wait.

824
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:41,319
Was this shit
supposed to be serious?

825
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,690
You expect me to stand there and listen?
Get the fuck out of here.

826
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:45,752
Don't let her get to you.

827
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,525
Don't let her get to you, okay?

828
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,930
She's about to become the head
of the New York division too.

829
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,457
- Can you believe that?
- What'd you get out of this, Bill?

830
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,128
- What'd I get out of it?
- Yeah, you got an upgrade?

831
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,967
You gonna be sergeant?
Captain? What?

832
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,632
Take it easy.
I'm on your side.

833
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,641
Now I understand you got
a history with this Phillips.

834
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,007
He saved my fucking life, man.

835
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,309
Hey, know why I'm here?

836
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:06,578
You do this,
you've got detective first grade.

837
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,981
It's real this time. Huh?

838
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:15,992
Approved yesterday.

839
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:19,826
Office of your choice.
Shift of your choice.

840
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:23,355
All you got to do is just get
through this one lousy thing.

841
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,200
You know, it's always
one more thing with you, Bill.

842
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,070
Hey, don't throw this away.

843
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:33,008
- Hey, Tango.
- (engine starts)

844
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:34,738
Don't throw this away.
This is your life.

845
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,748
Sal: All right, let's up the ante.
Five buck ante.

846
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:50,021
Let's do it.
Let's play like men.

847
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,119
- Put your five bucks in.
- I already anted.

848
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:55,427
So you guys hear
the latest

849
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,763
on Bobby Powers?

850
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,269
I'm gonna slap you.
Come on.

851
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:03,364
Word is he was in on this
insurance scam with the mob.

852
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,671
He is so fucked.
Wait a minute.

853
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,701
If his old lady moves out on him
because of this, I call first dibs.

854
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,373
Come on, no wives,
no girlfriends, man.

855
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:14,680
So one of these wiseguys gets pinched
for some drug thing in Jersey

856
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:18,279
and to save his own ass he rats
on Bobby for guess what?

857
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:21,883
- Robbing dealers in Brooklyn.
- Prick.

858
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:24,985
I'll never get that. If you're gonna do
something wrong there's a risk.

859
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:27,519
If you can't handle the risk,
you shouldn't do it in the first place.

860
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:30,055
Yeah, one bad cop
makes us all look bad.

861
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,795
Ronny, are you retarded?

862
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:33,427
I'm talking about the mob guy
who ratted him out.

863
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,630
Boy Scouts of America over here.

864
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,935
Girl Scout. Yo, throw me
a couple cookies, huh?

865
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,499
Come on, Ronny. These wiseguys,
they break the law to become wiseguys.

866
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:42,808
And then soon as shit goes bad
they break their bullshit mafia codes

867
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:45,713
to get witness protection under the same
laws they were breaking in the first place.

868
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:48,183
Wait wait wait wait.
I wasn't talking about the fucking mafia.

869
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:50,413
I was talking about us.
Cops.

870
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,445
I don't know about you, Pat,

871
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,583
but I think we're too good
to take drug money, right?

872
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:58,025
I say get off your high horse.
There's no civilians in the room.

873
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:00,552
- You gonna call?
- I'm in, baby.

874
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,963
- Okay.
- Read 'em and weep.

875
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,161
- You too, Brutus?
- Read 'em and weep.

876
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:08,171
Cheddar coming, kid.
That's it, baby.

877
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:11,436
Give me that money, kid.
I love the smell.

878
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,908
Would you do it? Tell 'em.
Sal, come on.

879
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:16,913
We all know where that money goes.

880
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,676
Better still, we know
where it doesn't go.

881
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:21,775
It's not going to rehab clinics.
That money is not going to junkies

882
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:24,184
to help with their families.
It sure as shit is not going to us,

883
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:26,212
'cause I haven't had a raise
in four years, all right?

884
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,918
They got millions
of dollars sitting in an office

885
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:31,257
waiting to get shoveled
to the city's excess fund,

886
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:32,761
and you know what that is.

887
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:36,493
It's city big shots decorating
their offices with mahogany desks

888
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,366
and Persian rugs, right?
All with drug money.

889
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,268
We risk life and limb

890
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:44,364
taking and giving money
to scumbags who don't deserve it.

891
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,740
So far be it for me to wag my finger

892
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,608
at somebody
who's looking out for himself.

893
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:51,307
You guys want to take
the soapbox away here?

894
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,179
You brought a tear
to my eye right there.

895
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,446
Hey, fuck you guys.

896
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:56,918
Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

897
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:59,820
I'm on your side.
The city's got no respect for cops.

898
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,687
I mean, what's the starting pay?

899
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,352
$20,000.

900
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,554
All right, 20 fucking grand.
Come on.

901
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,222
Who's gonna raise a family on that?

902
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,062
All right, that's it.
That's the worst part of it.

903
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,968
All right, the $100,000 they pay your family
if you get killed in the line of duty.

904
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:15,369
Fat lot of good that does anybody.

905
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,168
You're worth more to them
dead than alive, man

906
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:18,697
100K.
You know what?

907
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,370
Shoot me in the fucking face.
My girl needs a new car.

908
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,675
Hey, don't you touch that gun.

909
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,739
Again, the point that you've got to be
a fatality to provide for your kids...

910
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:29,115
- Daddy.
- Shit, I told you don't come down here.

911
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,586
Shit.
Nobody touch the cards or the...

912
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:34,818
shit, I told you
not to come down here, all right?

913
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,190
Nobody touch the money.
Nobody touch the cards.

914
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:39,525
What are you doing down here?
What, Vinny? Vinny, what?

915
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:42,088
Daddy, Vinny keeps coming in my room.
We're trying to get dressed.

916
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,929
What is that skirt?
What are you doing?

917
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,559
Um, what is this smoke?

918
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,467
- All right, see what I told you?
- Touch.

919
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,904
All right, don't worry about the smoke.
Don't tell your mother.

920
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,135
Here, you and Myeisha take this.

921
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:53,904
Go out and have
a good time, all right?

922
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,571
I love you.
Give me a kiss.

923
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,375
- Bye, Myeisha.
- Good bye.

924
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,939
- Bye, have fun.
- Change that skirt.

925
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:02,110
People will start to think
we're Catholic only on Sundays.

926
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,985
Yo yo, Sally Sal, I didn't realize
you were living in Harlem.

927
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,511
- (beatboxing)
- Watch your mouth.

928
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:08,387
Don't fuck around, Patrick.

929
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:10,985
We don't talk like that in this house.
Not in front of my kid.

930
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:13,257
I dig it over here
on Malcolm X Boulevard.

931
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,094
- Oh no, you didn't.
- Yes, I did, my nigga.

932
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,397
- See you later, Dad.
- Ronny: Hey, Pat.

933
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,164
You want me to come over there
and kick your ass?

934
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,761
- Is that what you want?
- Ooh.

935
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,399
- You know my wife is black.
- Of course I know your wife is black.

936
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:27,274
My shorty is black. Don't we go
shopping for cocoa butter together?

937
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,675
Now that's it!

938
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,581
- You racist prick!
- What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

939
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,915
What the fuck, Sal?

940
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:39,410
Fuck you, I'm a fucking racist.
I would take a bullet for you, Sal.

941
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:42,584
Not in front of my kids.
I listen to your shit all day long.

942
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,890
Come on, George, get off of me.

943
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:46,486
What the fuck, Sal?

944
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,191
Take it outside.
Take it outside.

945
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,823
- You're dead, man.
- Just take him upstairs.

946
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:52,858
Take him upstairs for five minutes.
Just give us five minutes.

947
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:55,394
That's all I need is
someone fucking with my game.

948
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:00,042
What's going on?

949
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,567
Ronny, I'm in trouble.

950
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,580
Okay.

951
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,374
Angie's expecting twins.

952
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,091
(chuckles)

953
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,586
Twins?

954
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:23,395
You lucky bastard.
Congratulations. That's a problem?

955
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,628
Ronny, I ain't got room for twins.

956
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:29,105
Sure you do.
You've got room here.

957
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,334
Ronny, if I don't get a new house
or get some more bread,

958
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:35,310
I got to tell one of these kids
that they got to move in with my sister.

959
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,471
How am I gonna do that?

960
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,981
How am I gonna tell one of 'em
that you're the one

961
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,575
that's got to go?
I can't do that.

962
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,855
You don't have to do
that right away, all right?

963
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,654
I mean, how big are twins?

964
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,160
They're like this size.

965
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:53,628
Keep 'em in a drawer
for the first year.

966
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,824
Don't worry about it.

967
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:58,129
You know what I'd give for one?

968
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,795
You're a lucky guy.

969
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:02,361
- You know something? You're right.
- This ain't a problem.

970
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,870
Mrs. Vincent, it's Sal.

971
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,345
I have the money
for the down payment.

972
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,972
Mrs. Vincent:
You've got the whole thing?

973
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:14,677
No, actually I don't
have all the money.

974
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,379
Mrs. Vincent:
Is there a problem?

975
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,852
No no, there's not a problem.

976
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,583
The situation is just complicated,
that's all, Mrs. Vincent.

977
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:28,028
No, I know the deadline is Tuesday.
There's no problem about the deadline.

978
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:29,725
I'm gonna have it well
before the deadline.

979
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,734
That's not a problem.
All right? Hand to God.

980
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,538
Oh fuck.

981
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:39,303
No, you don't got to keep thanking
me about the violations thing.

982
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:41,310
- It's not a problem.
- I appreciate it.

983
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,904
Well, I appreciate you keeping
the house off the market for me.

984
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,677
- Otherwise I couldn't afford it.
- How can you?

985
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:48,946
How can I afford it?
Um...

986
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:51,317
You know what, Mrs. Vincent?
You hear that train?

987
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,879
I got another train coming by in
a second so why don't I just do this...

988
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:56,551
I'm gonna call you back
when I have all the money

989
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:58,185
and then we can figure out
a time to meet.

990
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:01,322
- Okay, God bless you.
- Okay, God bless you too, okay?

991
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:06,730
(crowd chanting)
Shot him down! Shot him down!

992
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,473
NYPD shot him down.

993
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,136
Fuck the police.

994
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,543
Officer:
Back up, please. Back up.

995
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:20,907
- NYPD shot him down.
- We ain't scared of you no more.

996
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,083
Officer Dugan.

997
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:28,716
Some guy,
I think he's the captain,

998
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,318
he said that the guy I was with
yesterday is going with your guy

999
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,192
and I'm with you.

1000
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:35,754
I don't know why
they keep switching us.

1001
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,289
(crowd continues yelling)

1002
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,700
Officer:
Stay behind the barricade.

1003
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,643
Get inside.

1004
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,444
No, the other side.

1005
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:57,481
Officer:
Back up, people. Back up.

1006
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,997
- Eddie Quinlan.
- Windows up.

1007
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,133
(car starts)

1008
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,441
Listen, kid, I'm not sure
what you did yesterday

1009
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:29,316
or how you did it, but today we're gonna
do things a little different, all right?

1010
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:32,412
Yeah.

1011
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:35,356
Man on radio:
Central Aviation 1, be advised.

1012
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,054
Verify arson explosion.
Respond with Central.

1013
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:41,029
Woman on radio:
Copy that. All medical units respond.

1014
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,261
Man on radio: Central Aviation 1, be
advised I'm in the vicinity of BK housing.

1015
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,927
We have an RMP on fire.

1016
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,699
Woman on radio:
Part of a 904. Part of a 904.

1017
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,707
Man on radio: Can you get
an eye on that second building?

1018
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,369
(radio chatter continues)

1019
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:10,149
Come on, cop.
I was an eyewitness.

1020
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:14,222
So I could get...
I could get posted here?

1021
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,961
Woman on radio:
This is 1-Central. This is 1-Central.

1022
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:22,495
Any units in the vicinity
of 742 Rockaway Avenue,

1023
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,769
a reported 10-10 in progress.
The owner...

1024
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:28,175
- (turns off radio)
- (siren blaring)

1025
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:36,977
Quinlan:
I'm allergic to fire

1026
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,682
and this gun is a lot lighter
than a mailbag.

1027
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,781
You sure got everything figured out.

1028
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:43,520
How could I not, right?

1029
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:46,552
Just live long enough to get
a retirement good enough

1030
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:49,224
to have a nice pension
and what else is there?

1031
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:52,530
What are you gonna do between
now and that pension?

1032
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,833
I'm gonna do the job.

1033
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:56,839
And what's the job?

1034
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:59,341
The job.

1035
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:02,071
Yeah, right.
It's not what you expect.

1036
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,579
It's never going to be.
It couldn't be.

1037
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:09,774
Just keep your eyes open
and keep walking.

1038
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,447
Whoa, you all right?

1039
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,923
- I'm cool.
- Okay.

1040
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,859
But I have won my appeal.

1041
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:23,388
Oh, they can do that shit?
Appeal the appeal, huh?

1042
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:26,527
Whatever.

1043
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:29,037
What's up?

1044
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:31,973
These motherfuckers is rabid, man.

1045
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,602
They're thirsty.
They want to eat up all the food, man.

1046
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:36,043
What you mean?

1047
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,842
Fucking lawyer's telling me
they're talking about charging me

1048
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:39,405
with some shit from 10 years ago.

1049
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:42,043
That's just gonna get thrown out.
Don't worry about that.

1050
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:44,519
That shit ain't gonna stick.

1051
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:47,148
Fucking freedom ain't free, boy.
I'm telling you.

1052
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,125
I'm putting these motherfucker's
grandchildren through college.

1053
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:51,649
Officer:
Hey hey hey.

1054
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:54,458
Uniform got popped in
Bed-Stuy, didn't make it.

1055
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:56,795
New guy, Melvin Panton.

1056
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,664
(officers murmuring)

1057
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,033
Jesus fucking Christ.

1058
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:09,502
It's a fucking shame,

1059
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,912
a young guy like that.

1060
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,380
Probably just starting a family.

1061
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:19,152
Yeah yeah, probably.
Probably did.

1062
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,484
Hey, Sal.
It's Angela.

1063
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:25,926
- Tell her I'll call her back.
- She says it's important.

1064
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:27,930
All right.

1065
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:13,332
- Get up.
- (groans)

1066
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,606
- Oh, thanks.
- Any news?

1067
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:18,170
No, nothing. Nothing.

1068
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,052
Angie's as tough as they come.
She'll pull through.

1069
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:32,093
She'll be back to calling you
an asshole in next to no time.

1070
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,119
(laughs)

1071
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,193
Thanks.

1072
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:39,667
Anytime.

1073
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,465
(phone vibrating)

1074
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,665
Oh shit.

1075
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:49,810
Yeah, hi.
How are you?

1076
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:53,543
Yeah, I'm aware that
the deadline is tomorrow.

1077
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,278
I'm well aware of that.

1078
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,445
But the good news is it's all settled.

1079
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,047
Uh-huh, all good. Yup.

1080
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,190
No, l... well, I can't really
talk right now.

1081
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:07,594
But if you call me in the AM
I'll do it first thing.

1082
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,495
Yeah yeah yeah.
Okay.

1083
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,261
You too. Bye bye.

1084
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,169
Everything okay?

1085
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,107
Mr. Rosario.

1086
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:22,134
Yeah, hey. So the asthma?

1087
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,579
Well, your wife has significant traces
of wood mold in her lungs.

1088
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:28,345
- Wood mold.
- When you have wood inside your house

1089
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:30,909
- the particles travel in the air...
- I know all about the mold.

1090
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,750
Well, if your wife's case,
because of her asthma

1091
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,257
her lungs are working three times
as hard as they should,

1092
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:37,919
which is jeopardizing her and the twins.

1093
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:42,320
One of the babies is significantly
smaller than the other.

1094
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,765
- But they're okay though?
- For now.

1095
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:47,599
Mr. Rosario, have you
considered moving?

1096
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,773
Yeah, I have.

1097
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,662
(siren wailing)

1098
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:30,108
- Fuck you, man. Fuck you.
- Whoa whoa.

1099
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,512
Whoa whoa whoa!

1100
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:35,676
He accused me
of stealing fucking candy.

1101
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:37,879
Stop. Whoa! Whoa!

1102
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,013
Hey hey! Stop!

1103
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:42,217
Calm down, everybody.

1104
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:45,852
Just...

1105
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:48,386
You hear me now?
Huh?

1106
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,025
We got this shit working like clockwork.

1107
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,035
You want to go and fuck up our money?

1108
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:55,662
Get your little bitch ass up, man.

1109
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:58,299
- Don't kill me.
- What'd you tell them niggas, huh?

1110
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:01,105
- Don't kill me, man.
- I can send your ass.

1111
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:04,045
Uh-huh, I hope your ass
can fly, nigga.

1112
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,547
Do your little ass dirty.

1113
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:10,051
Go go go.

1114
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:13,453
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Get the fuck down.

1115
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:15,821
Stay the fuck down
and keep your mouth shut.

1116
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,917
What are you doing?
Get the fuck off me.

1117
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,621
(pots clatter)

1118
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:28,531
Get that shit in the bag.
Get it in the bag. Hurry up.

1119
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:30,163
Here they come.
Come on.

1120
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,383
(gunshot)
