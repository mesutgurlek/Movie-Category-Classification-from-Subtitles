01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:12,253
Just faxed... Fixed the copier.

975
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,838
I can make a copy later.

976
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:16,122
- I gotta go. I'm gonna go. Okay.
- Okay.

977
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,091
- Lisa, you dog.
- Woof, woof.

978
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,978
Hey, um, are you still doing payroll?

979
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,272
Yeah, I'm a payroll lifer, why?

980
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,857
Can you give me Jerry's address?

981
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,859
I wanna bring him a gift or something.

982
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,601
Like a whoopie cake. It's nothing.

983
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,687
Or you could just ask him.

984
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,532
I want it to be a surprise.

985
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:42,983
Please?

986
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,916
That's a lot of cheese sandwiches
to eat in one sitting! Forty one!

987
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,710
WOMAN: And that tiny
Sonya Thomas always wins!

988
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,420
And now a grimmer story.

989
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,341
A woman murdered.
Her partial remains dumped in the woods!

990
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,510
- So sad!
- So terrible!

991
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:04,097
Reporter Sheila Hammer
has an Action One News exclusive.

992
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,932
The grisly discovery Tuesday,

993
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,352
near Milton, of an unidentified
female stabbing victim,

994
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:12,397
has local police on the hunt
for a serial killer.

995
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,273
- Jerry, you're a serial killer!
- Sheriff Weinbacher.

996
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:15,566
- No, he isn't.
- (JERRY SHUSHING)

997
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,318
Now with the aid of the FBI,
we have developed

998
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:19,904
a profile of the unknown killer.

999
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,782
Male, late 20s or early 30s,

1000
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,576
white, lower or middle class.
Trouble fitting in.

1001
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:28,705
- That's you, Jerry. Can I have an autograph?
- JERRY: Shh.

1002
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,040
Will he kill again?

1003
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,168
Well, if he's not stopped soon,
every indication is

1004
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,994
he will kill again.

1005
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,297
You hear that, punk?

1006
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:40,466
- Oh, no! No! No, no.
- You're a killer.

1007
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:41,968
- God.
- A serial killer!

1008
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,094
I don't wanna be a killer.

1009
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,930
Too late, shitbag.
There's no turning back.

1010
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:49,132
You're a stone-cold murdering maniac.

1011
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:54,731
MR. WHISKERS: Told you so.

1012
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:55,815
Told me so what?

1013
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,358
I told you you like killing.

1014
01:03:57,458 --> 01:04:00,153
And now the cops,
they say the same thing.

1015
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,686
FIONA: Jerry!

1016
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,191
Jerry!

1017
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:10,946
Jerry!

1018
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:13,958
What they saying about you, love?

1019
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:15,168
That I'm a killer.

1020
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,660
Take me out.

1021
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,589
Let's talk about it.

1022
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,122
What if I am?

1023
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:23,301
FIONA: Serial killer?

1024
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,343
Yeah!

1025
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,512
FIONA:
Well, is it something that you are?

1026
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:29,098
Like being brown-eyed or right-handed.

1027
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:32,059
Or is it something that you choose?

1028
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:33,811
Like being an accountant.

1029
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:34,854
I wish I knew.

1030
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,689
You can still make the choice, Jerry.

1031
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:37,857
You're still a good man.

1032
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:41,068
I try to be a good man.
I wanna be a good man.

1033
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:42,195
Then there's the cat...

1034
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,197
Fuck you, blaming it on me.

1035
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,950
Hold on a second!
Look, I know what is good.

1036
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,536
I know. I wanna lead
a righteous and just life.

1037
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,497
I wanna be an upstanding member
of the community.

1038
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,123
But, you know, Mr. Whiskers,

1039
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,209
he makes me do bad things.

1040
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,045
The cat was nowhere near
when you killed me, Jerry.

1041
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:01,464
See? See? Thank you, lady-head.

1042
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,049
Okay. First of all, not true.

1043
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:07,053
Second of all,
um, I know right from wrong, okay?

1044
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,806
I know it. I try to be good.

1045
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,548
But then certain

1046
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,897
horrible things happened
and I am filled with...

1047
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:21,400
With terror and dread,
standing outside of myself.

1048
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:26,271
Even though I know
what I've done, I also feel like...

1049
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,075
Like it wasn't me.

1050
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,745
Pretty complicated inside
the human mind, huh?

1051
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:36,249
It was you that killed me, Jerry. You.

1052
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:39,669
Okay, that's true,
but in a certain sense, it wasn't me.

1053
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,161
It was, uh...

1054
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,256
You gonna say it was me?

1055
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,590
No, I wasn't gonna say that.

1056
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,425
MR. WHISKERS:
All right. Devil's advo-cat.

1057
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:49,512
Let's say it was me, but you know that

1058
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,597
I'm a talking cat.
There's no such thing.

1059
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:54,976
Everything I say is really you.

1060
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:56,519
- (LAUGHING)
- It's true, buddy. It's all you.

1061
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,603
What?

1062
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,939
Come on, Jer. You know that.

1063
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:02,223
Your pets are spot-on, Jerry.

1064
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,311
I kind of suspected that.

1065
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,408
But if there's me,

1066
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:14,819
you know, regular me, standing here,
the me who is talking now,

1067
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:18,499
and I wanna be good.

1068
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,918
Then there's you, you and you,

1069
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:23,870
trying to make me be something else.

1070
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,956
- Am I good?
- No.

1071
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,177
- You're bad.
- She's wrong. You're a good boy.

1072
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,889
They're both wrong.
You are what you are.

1073
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,464
That's it.

1074
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:37,727
I am...

- Bosco, Bosco!

1078

I got your back, Jerry!
I got your back, Jerry!

Just a second!
Just trying to put my dog away!

1081
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,732
Hey, Jerry, is that my new friend?

1082
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:55,902
Oh, Jerry, I just need
a whiff of her butt.

(STAMMERING)
No, I'm so glad that you came.

1089
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,347
No, no. I'm imposing. I can tell.

1090
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,464
- Oh, you look beautiful.
- Thank you!

1091
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,008
Um, I brought you some cakes.

1092
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,387
You're amazing. Thank you for this.

1093
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,056
There's four of them.

1094
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:30,237
Sorry, if... Do you have company?
Or am I interrupting?

1095
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:32,615
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Wait. Yeah, I...

1096
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:35,034
It's just that... What you heard is, um,

1097
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:36,943
that I sometimes... I talk to my pets.

1098
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:40,331
- A lot of the time.
- No, me too.

1099
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,491
All the time. And they
sometimes talk to me. Sometimes.

1100
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,244
I get that.

1101
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,414
- Thank you for the cake.
- Are you locked out?

1102

Uh, it's okay.

1103
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,095
I'll figure out how to get in somehow.

1104

You don't need to stay around.

1105
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:00,893
And how are you gonna get in?

1106
01:08:00,993 --> 01:08:02,645
There's a skylight.

1107
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,647
I can totally get in
through the skylight.

1108
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,097
Really?

1109
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:09,443
You know, I'm pretty good
at getting in places.

1110

I lose my keys all the time, so...

I'm gonna use the skylight.

01:20:01,713 --> 01:20:03,490
It's not the cat! I know that now.

1291
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,951
Jerry, we had an agreement.

1292
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,526
I know. I'm sorry.

1293
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:11,289
Dr. Warren! I'm a bad person.

1294
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:13,532
Don't be so hard on yourself.

1295
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:16,744
I appreciate your honesty.

1296
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:19,965
I'm disappointed,

1297
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:23,000
but hey, it's not like
you killed someone.

1298
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:25,461
Um...

1299
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:27,931
What, Jerry?

1300
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,965
It is kind of like that.

1301
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:33,385
Kind of like that times three.

1302
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,390
What are you saying, Jerry?

1303
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:43,020
Three people who
aren't alive anymore because of me.

1305
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:46,273
Yeah. I know.

1306
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,286
I feel terrible about it.

1307
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,998
And I really need your help right now.

1308
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:54,207
I'll help you, Jerry.

1309
01:20:54,307 --> 01:20:55,375
Thank you.

1310
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,618
Go ahead. I'm listening.

1311
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:02,998
Okay. You know the conga line?

1312
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,011
At your company party. Yeah.

1313
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:07,503
Yeah.

1314
01:21:09,739 --> 01:21:12,434
Everybody sang A Happy Song.

1315
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:17,147
And you know that English girl, Fiona,
we conga-ed

1316
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,316
and we were supposed to go to Shi Shan,

1317
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,392
see an awesome show and...

1318
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:24,738
What are you doing, Doctor Warren?
Give me that.

1319
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,656
- DR. WARREN: No!
- Sorry, wrong number!

1320
01:21:26,756 --> 01:21:28,950
- Help me! I'm being held hostage.
- JERRY: It was an accident!

1321
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,620
I liked all of them
and wish they were all alive.

1322
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,246
But there's nothing
that I can do about that now.

1323
01:21:33,346 --> 01:21:34,831
Wait, do you have packing tape?

1324
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:36,124
What? Why?

1325
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:37,334
Because I can't let you go.

1326
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:39,535
And I still need a lot of therapy.

1327
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:44,883
No! Stay there!
You stay there now! Back! Back!

1328
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:48,220

Let's discuss this.

1332
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,906
JERRY:
Okay. We haven't got a lot of time,

1333
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:09,565
so we gotta get into the big issues.

Mmm.

1336
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:15,038
Me too. But I totally think
that he has it out for me.

1337
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:17,415
He cuts everyone else slack
and then totally craps all over me,

1338
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:19,793
and I wanna know why.

1339
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:22,838
Why would he put a little boy
in a home with a father like that?

1340
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:26,081
Make my mother lose herself so completely
that she'd rather die than be with me?

1341
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:32,097
But if he is all-knowing,
God must be okay with me killing people.

and I can't predict what I'll do.

1347

Oh.

1348
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,396
Now, why do I hear voices?

1349
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:51,950
Oh.

1350
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:54,828
A lot of people hear voices.

1351
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,780
Or thoughts they can't stop.

1352
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,115
- A lot of people?
- Yeah.

1353
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:02,002
It might be a voice

1354
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:05,338
telling them
they're worthless or stupid.

1355
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:09,426
Or it could tell them
to indulge every desire.

1356
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:11,219
"Drink that drink." "Take that drug."

1357
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:12,804
"Follow every sexual impulse."

1358
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:14,806
Or it could be a cynical voice

1359
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:16,349
telling them nothing matters,

1360
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:18,602
that their efforts are insignificant.

1361
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:20,344
You hear stuff like that?

1362
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:23,565
Yeah. I have thoughts.

1363
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:24,983
Not exactly the same as you,

1364
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:27,777
but similar.

1365
01:23:27,877 --> 01:23:29,821
They tell me that I'm fat,

1366
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:34,409
or psychotherapy is not
a worthwhile exercise.

1367
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:35,994
That it's not real.

1368
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:39,164
That I should have aimed higher
than a government job,

1369
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,949
that my potential is being squandered,

1370
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,701
that I'm unworthy of love.

1371
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:49,540
But none of that is true.
So what do you do about it?

1372
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:54,721
Well, I can't shut them off entirely,

1373
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:56,514
nor would I want to,

1374
01:23:56,614 --> 01:23:59,100
but I can argue against them.

1375
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,477
Just because you have thoughts,

1376
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:02,886
doesn't mean you have to act on them.

1377
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,891
You don't have to act on them?

1378
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,310
No!

1379
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:14,074
Being alone in the world

1380
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:16,400
is the root of all suffering.
