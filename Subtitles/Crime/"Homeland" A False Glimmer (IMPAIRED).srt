172
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:48,423

173
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:53,929

Give us the room, gentlemen.

179

This charade is over.

180
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,647
And I'm your
self-appointed confessor.

181

Okay.

182
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:00,451
How old are you
now, Ivan?

183
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,819
50?

184
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,988
Two. 52.

185
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,523
So...

186
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,291
she was your
life's work.

187
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:12,564
Mind me asking whose idea it
was for her to come on to me?

188
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:17,134
On second thought,
don't answer that.

189
00:12:17,202 --> 00:12:19,136
I'd rather not know.

190
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,111
I guess the boys
didn't tell you?

191
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,780
Tell me what?

192
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:32,283
Chemical attack at
Hauptbahnhof's been thwarted.

193
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,850
Two terrorists dead,

194
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,286
rest on the run,

195
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:36,787
your girlfriend in the wind.

196
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,324
Sorry, I-I...

197
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,193
Now you've lost me.

198
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,660
I'll make it
simple.

199
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,362
Allison was ordered
by your bosses

200
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,064
to let the attack
go forward.

201
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:50,000
She tried, she failed.

202
00:12:50,068 --> 00:12:52,669
She's since disappeared.

203
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:54,370
Well...

204
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:56,005
if you're telling the truth,

205
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:58,874
she has been, uh, busy.

206
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:02,912
If I'm telling the truth,
you're burned, my friend.

207
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,348
You're left holding the bag.

208
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:07,783
How do you figure?

209
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:10,120
Allison on her way
back to Moscow

210
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:12,455
means you're no defector.

211
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:17,293
Means she's the Russian agent
we've been saying all along.

212
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:22,165
If you're telling the truth.

213
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:25,502
I'm good.

214
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:27,703
But I'm not that good.

215
00:13:27,771 --> 00:13:30,172
A story with so
many moving parts

216
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,342
would've taken weeks
to dream up.

217
00:13:37,313 --> 00:13:39,548
You know I'm right.

218
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:43,686
Hmm.

219
00:13:43,754 --> 00:13:45,688
Say...

220
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:49,058
Let's say I do believe you.

221
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:50,559
What do you want?

222
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:53,763
I want her back.
I want her punished.

223
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,899
And what makes you think
I even know where she is

224
00:13:56,967 --> 00:13:59,068
or how they're gonna
get her out of the country?

225
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:01,570
'Cause if she were
my agent, I'd know.

226
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:04,739
- Hmm.
- 'Cause I'd know everything about her.

227
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:07,909
Down to the very last detail.

228
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:11,346
When to scold, when to forgive.

229
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:13,415
When to laugh at her jokes.

230
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:17,352
Except she's the one running me.

231
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:24,059
Ivan.

232
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:26,228
I say this respectfully.

233
00:14:26,296 --> 00:14:29,298
One professional
to another.

234
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:33,901
You're playing a bad hand.

235
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:43,244
(sighs)

236
00:14:46,648 --> 00:14:48,749
I understand
you were a ski racer.

237
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:50,418
Downhill?

238
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:52,986
Giant slalom was my event.
Why?

239
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:56,123
How does resettlement in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming sound?

240
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:58,626
Witness protection,

241
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:00,695
a sizable
living expense.

242
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:04,365
I'd miss the Alps.

243
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,132
You'll miss 'em either way.

244
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,901
And there's no family in the
picture, is there? Not a wife

245
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:11,605
or children?

246
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:13,806
So you've devoted
your entire life

247
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:17,977
to an institution that's now
turning its back on you.

248
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:19,312
The last illusion

249
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,281
of the illusionless man.

250
00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:23,750
(soft chuckle)

251
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:25,752
(mutters)

252
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:26,919
What?

253
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:28,255
What's so amusing?

254
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:31,291
Nothing, nothing.

255
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:34,628
It's a good pitch you're making.

256
00:15:34,695 --> 00:15:36,963
I'm... I'm admiring it.

257
00:15:43,904 --> 00:15:46,038
I was gonna tell you
it's not for nothing.

258
00:15:46,106 --> 00:15:47,673
- No?
- No.

259
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:48,875
Hmm.

260
00:15:48,942 --> 00:15:50,977
You came this close

261
00:15:51,044 --> 00:15:53,980
to painting a masterpiece.

262
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:55,648
This close.

263
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:59,385
And not many people
can say that.

264
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:07,193
But I won't
be making you another offer

265
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:09,361
like this anytime soon.

266
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:11,363
I'm being generous,

267
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:15,134
because you have
something I want very much.

268
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:18,470
Take it or leave it.

269
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:33,352
Very well.

270
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:38,357
It's a shame, though.

271
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:40,526
I would've enjoyed
talking to you again.

272
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:44,029
It was my idea.

273
00:16:52,438 --> 00:16:54,439
You were an easy target, Saul.

274
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:57,042
Middle-aged,

275
00:16:57,109 --> 00:16:58,910
recently divorced.

276
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:03,882
I knew if you were
sleeping with her,

277
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,552
you wouldn't see
other things so clearly.

278
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:19,898
Where is she, then, Ivan?

279
00:17:19,966 --> 00:17:23,701

on getting her out of Germany?

00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:33,142
I don't know.

342

They've got Laura
and they won't let me see her.

343
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:39,681
It's fucked.

344
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,855
I didn't know where else to go.

345
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:49,725
You heard about the attack?

346
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:53,028
Nothing happened, right?

347
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:54,696
- It's over.
- Yeah, they got the guys.

348
00:21:54,764 --> 00:21:56,064
There was a big shootout

349
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:57,733
at a house in Prenzlauer Berg.

350
00:22:04,774 --> 00:22:06,875
It's good to see you.

351
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:08,644
Feels like it's been forever.

352
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:11,713
Yeah, it does.

353
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,354
Come here.

354
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:33,869
Oh.

00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,121
Oh, wait. Wait. Wait.
What happened to your hand?

359
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,424
Nothing.

It'll make me happy

So that's it?

392
00:25:59,503 --> 00:26:02,638
We're just... we're just
gonna say good-bye

393
00:26:02,706 --> 00:26:04,941
like none of this ever happened?

394
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:06,743
It happened.

395
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:10,380
I was happy here.

396
00:26:10,447 --> 00:26:12,882
Franny was happy.
I think you were, too.

397
00:26:12,949 --> 00:26:15,117
Yeah, I was.

398
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:17,219
So why can't we just pick up
where we left off?

399
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:18,721
Would that be so hard?

400
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:21,056
- Come here, sit back down.
- No.

401
00:26:21,124 --> 00:26:22,558
I don't...
I don't want to sit down.

402
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:24,894
No, I-I want another chance.
I think we could do better

403
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:27,263
this time.

404
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:31,768
Look, I'm sorry.

405
00:26:31,835 --> 00:26:33,235
You're sorry?

406
00:26:33,303 --> 00:26:35,070
This is not easy
for me, either.

407
00:26:35,138 --> 00:26:37,973
I love you guys. I really do.

408
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,575
Then don't break up with us.

409
00:26:39,643 --> 00:26:42,278
Let's just put everything
back the way it was.

410
00:26:42,345 --> 00:26:44,013
Maybe you can't put
things back, eh?

411
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,781
- They won't go back.
- You don't know that.

412
00:26:45,848 --> 00:26:47,950
You don't know that
until we've tried.

413
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:49,484
I can't unhear things
I've heard,

414
00:26:49,552 --> 00:26:51,453
unsee things I've seen.
I'm sorry.

415
00:26:51,521 --> 00:26:52,721
Stop saying that.

416
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:54,123
- Stop saying that you're sorry.
- Look, look...

417
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,624
I don't want to go
through life always worried

418
00:26:55,691 --> 00:26:57,326
about what's around
the next corner.

419
00:26:57,394 --> 00:26:59,461
And I don't want
my kids to, either.

420
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:04,300
- Your kids?
- Yeah.

421
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:06,302
What happened to Steffan
can never happen again.

422
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:09,271
- It won't.
- You can't promise me that.

423
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:10,906
- Jonas...
- Carrie, I'm doing us both a favor.

424
00:27:10,974 --> 00:27:12,908
Can't you see?

425
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:15,844
It will never work
is what I'm saying.

426
00:27:15,912 --> 00:27:19,180
It was a crazy idea
to begin with.

427
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:21,817
Oh, so now I'm crazy?

428
00:27:21,884 --> 00:27:24,018
- I didn't say that.
- I'm not crazy, Jonas.

429
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:25,620
- No.
- I went off my meds for a reason.

430
00:27:25,688 --> 00:27:27,355
- I know.
- (scoffs)

431
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:31,125
No. No, you know what was crazy?

432
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:33,361
Was that I actually
opened myself up to you

433
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:34,863
and really
let you in.

434
00:27:34,931 --> 00:27:36,498
We are not talking
about the same thing.

435
00:27:36,566 --> 00:27:39,801
I'm talking about loving you,
about being loved.

436
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:41,169
What are you talking about?

437
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:43,705
Hey. Hey, come on.

438
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:45,305
No, no, no. No,
I don't want that.

439
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:46,974
I don't want it.
I won't allow it.

440
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:15,869
No.

441
00:28:15,936 --> 00:28:18,371
No, no.

Peter Quinn--
he was in Room 303.

443
00:28:22,142 --> 00:28:23,743
He's not there.
Where is he?

444
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:25,177
- Are you his wife?
- No.

445
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,346
- Family?
- I am a friend, goddamn it! Where is he?

446
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,848
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to calm down.

447
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,416
He's in the OR.

448
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:31,851
He had a brain hemorrhage.

449
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,021
The neurosurgical team
is operating on him now.

450
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:38,090
What, so he had a stroke?

451
00:28:38,158 --> 00:28:41,027
In his case,
intracerebral and quite severe.

452
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,529
How long has he been in surgery?

453
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:47,033
A couple of hours now, but
he's gonna be in there a while.

454
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,600
Five or six hours at least.

455
00:28:48,668 --> 00:28:51,904
Can I show you to
the waiting room?

456

457
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,741
Is there a chapel?

I'm sorry.
I've-I've forgotten your name.

- I remember.

- Oh.

- May I join you, Carrie?
- Of course.

477
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:53,354
So, he's out of surgery.

478
00:30:53,421 --> 00:30:55,422
But the hematoma
was very large.

479
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,892
We had to perform a
craniotomy, drain it

480
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,527
and repair the bleed.

481
00:30:59,594 --> 00:31:01,428
What does that mean?
Will he recover?

482
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:04,365
Well, it's too soon to tell.

483
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:05,767
Come on, Doctor.

484
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:08,202
You've seen a thousand
of these. You know.

485
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,838
Tell me.

486
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:12,506
It was a bad one.

487
00:31:12,574 --> 00:31:14,508
And even if he does recover,

488
00:31:14,576 --> 00:31:17,211
the brain damage
will be significant.

489
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:22,849
- Where is he?
- He's in post-op.

490
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,851
I need to see him.

491
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:26,887

502
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:13,091
I was beginning to think
you'd forgotten about me.

503
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,894
(sighs)

504
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:19,262
I'm going to tell you
three things.

505
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,065
All true.

506
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,266
(scoffs)

507
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,736
If you say so.

508
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:30,507
One-- Faisal Marwan is dead.

509
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,944
He threw himself out
a fifth story window

510
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,278
right here in this building.

511
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,282
You mean you threw him
out the window.

512
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,784
He jumped.

513
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,451
That is a fact.

514
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:45,287
You killed him.

515
00:33:45,355 --> 00:33:47,523
You fuckers.

516
00:33:47,591 --> 00:33:48,858
No.

517
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,793
We made a mistake
leaving him alone,

518
00:33:50,861 --> 00:33:53,963
but we did not kill him.

519
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:56,132
Still, that presents us
with a problem.

520
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:59,669
How to explain his death
to the German people.

521
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:00,737
No shit.

522
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:02,505
Which brings me
to the second thing.

523
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:04,406
Your friend Numan.

524
00:34:04,474 --> 00:34:08,044
What about him?

525
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,679
He's in the next cell.

526
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,848
We have his laptop.

527
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:15,151
We've recovered
the hacked documents.

528
00:34:15,218 --> 00:34:16,785
Since now they'll
never be published,

529
00:34:16,853 --> 00:34:18,154
you've lost your leverage.

530
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:23,025
(sighs)

531
00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:24,293
I'm happy to show him to you

532
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:26,295
if you don't believe me.

533
00:34:28,598 --> 00:34:31,200
You people.

534
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:34,170
You're the one who's abused
your position here in Germany.

535
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:36,172
Yeah?

536
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,075
So why am I not on a plane home
like you said?

537
00:34:40,143 --> 00:34:42,178
What am I still doing here?

538
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:45,513
Believe me, there are
plenty of my colleagues

539
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:47,848
not far from where we're sitting
who'd like nothing better than

540
00:34:47,916 --> 00:34:49,850
to see you rot
in a supermax prison.

541
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,586
You think I care
what you do to me?

542
00:34:51,654 --> 00:34:53,721
Ah.

543
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:58,893
But you are not the one
we're talking about, are you?

544
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:02,863
It's Numan.

545
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,901
What do you mean?

546
00:35:06,968 --> 00:35:10,338
His asylum status here
was granted

547
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:12,340
on a temporary basis only.

548
00:35:12,408 --> 00:35:14,509
Up for review

549
00:35:14,577 --> 00:35:16,877
every six months.

550
00:35:19,248 --> 00:35:21,516
Come on.

551
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:24,018
You wouldn't do that.

552
00:35:24,086 --> 00:35:26,687
Turkey's declared him
an enemy of the state.

553
00:35:26,755 --> 00:35:29,356
It is up to you, Laura.

554
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:38,966
They'll execute him or worse.

555
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:42,103
Either do exactly
as you're told,

556
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:45,239
or it's back
to where he came from.

557
00:35:50,478 --> 00:35:52,780

562
00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:07,984
ADAL:
What's the prognosis?

563
00:37:09,821 --> 00:37:12,923
Unchanged.

564
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,426
Not a good sign
he hasn't woken up.

565
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:19,797
No.

566
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:21,965
Pity.

567
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,634
If there's no improvement soon,

568
00:37:23,702 --> 00:37:26,704
they're talking about
changing his status

569
00:37:26,771 --> 00:37:28,639
to "minimally conscious."

570
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:30,974
What does that mean?

571
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:34,878
It means odds of recovering
cognitive function

572
00:37:34,946 --> 00:37:37,480
drops close to zero.

573
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:42,485
Poor Peter.

574
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,554
That's his worst nightmare.

575
00:37:44,621 --> 00:37:46,489
(grunts)

576
00:37:51,295 --> 00:37:54,597
You know, we found him
when he was 16.

577
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:57,567
No, I didn't know that.

578
00:37:59,937 --> 00:38:02,038
Foster home in Baltimore.

579
00:38:05,008 --> 00:38:07,443
The group was looking
for a street kid.

580
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:10,312
Someone real but also...

581
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:13,483
pretty enough to turn the head
of a Hong Kong paymaster.

582
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,821
He was a natural
from the start.

583
00:38:21,057 --> 00:38:24,494
I believe it.

584
00:38:24,561 --> 00:38:26,696
Couple years later,

585
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:28,865
I sponsored him for training.

586
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,100
Youngest guy ever.

587
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:39,708
Here.

588
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:41,610
What's this?

589
00:38:41,677 --> 00:38:45,247
You were
his beneficiary

590
00:38:45,315 --> 00:38:48,550
in case anything
happened to him in Syria.

591
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:55,224
I figured
I'd give it to you now.

592
00:38:56,459 --> 00:39:00,429
No telling when we might
see each other again.

Sure.

(indistinct chatter

How is he?

607
00:40:31,752 --> 00:40:33,519
Not great.

608
00:40:33,586 --> 00:40:36,355
I didn't come here
to fight with you.

609
00:40:36,423 --> 00:40:37,856
Okay.

610
00:40:37,924 --> 00:40:40,759
Given any more thought to what
we discussed the other day?

611
00:40:40,827 --> 00:40:42,794
I have not.

612
00:40:42,862 --> 00:40:45,964
But more thinking
isn't gonna change my mind.

613
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:48,134
I spoke to the Director.

614
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:51,103
He's prepared to offer you
complete autonomy, Carrie.

615
00:40:51,171 --> 00:40:53,739
Design your own mission,
pick your own team.

616
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:56,442
Not interested.

617
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,744
Sorry.

618
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:01,413
Mind telling me why?

619
00:41:03,082 --> 00:41:05,750
I think I deserve
an explanation.

620
00:41:07,653 --> 00:41:11,022
I'm not that person anymore.

621
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:13,791
You just saved
hundreds of lives.

622
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:14,892
I got lucky.

623
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,395
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

624
00:41:17,463 --> 00:41:18,896
If that weapon had gone off,
we'd be living

625
00:41:18,964 --> 00:41:20,398
in a different world today.

626
00:41:20,466 --> 00:41:22,100
We're already living
in a different world.

627
00:41:22,168 --> 00:41:23,968
The attack wasn't the first

628
00:41:24,036 --> 00:41:25,903
and it certainly
won't be the last.

629
00:41:25,971 --> 00:41:28,739
You're being selfish.

630
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:30,474
Really?

631
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:32,743
"Selfish"--
that's what you think?

632
00:41:32,811 --> 00:41:35,112
I think you know better than
anyone how to fight these guys.

633
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,981
That's the thing, Saul, I don't.

634
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:39,650
I have no idea.

635
00:41:39,718 --> 00:41:41,418
Then help us.

636
00:41:41,486 --> 00:41:42,787
Help me.

637
00:41:42,854 --> 00:41:45,255
Come up with a new paradigm.

638
00:41:49,227 --> 00:41:51,629

639
00:41:53,565 --> 00:41:56,032
I'm gonna go back in now.

640
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,501
Goddamn it, Carrie.

641
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,806
I need you.

642
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,746
And I told you I'm not
that person anymore.

You're kidding.

00:44:19,473 --> 00:44:22,575
promising to publish
more sensitive documents

669
00:44:22,643 --> 00:44:25,078
if her demands were not met.

670
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:28,815
I understand you have
a statement to make.

671
00:44:28,882 --> 00:44:30,951
Yes, I do.

672
00:44:33,687 --> 00:44:37,190
As a reporter, I've always
valued the truth above all else,

673
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:40,192
sometimes to the detriment
of my career,

674
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,527
certainly to the detriment
of my relationship

675
00:44:42,595 --> 00:44:46,865
to the country of my birth,
the United States of America,

676
00:44:46,933 --> 00:44:52,137
where... I haven't stepped foot
in three and a half years.

677
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,309
In stark contrast,

678
00:44:57,377 --> 00:45:01,146
Germany has provided me
with a home

679
00:45:01,214 --> 00:45:05,650
and the freedom
to do my work.

680
00:45:05,718 --> 00:45:08,854
I have tried
to demonstrate

681
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:11,122
my profound gratitude

682
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:14,459
by championing the rights
of the German people

683
00:45:14,526 --> 00:45:16,660
and by speaking truth to power.

684
00:45:32,077 --> 00:45:34,345
Four days ago, I appeared
on this program

685
00:45:34,413 --> 00:45:35,880
and made some
serious allegations

686
00:45:35,947 --> 00:45:37,482
about state security.

687
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:41,485
I accused the BND
of abrogating due process

688
00:45:41,553 --> 00:45:44,354
and arresting Faisal Marwan
for the second time

689
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:46,757
on what I claimed
were bogus charges.

690
00:45:46,825 --> 00:45:50,360
In the wake of last
week's failed attempt

691
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:53,030
at Berlin Hauptbahnhof

692
00:45:53,097 --> 00:45:58,101
and in light of new evidence
I have been given access to...

693
00:45:59,938 --> 00:46:02,372
I am now convinced
that Mr. Marwan is not

694
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,374
the innocent man
I thought he was.

695
00:46:04,442 --> 00:46:07,210
In fact, it is
now clear to me

696
00:46:07,278 --> 00:46:11,481
that he was a vital
and dedicated member

697
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:13,316
of the terror cell
that planned and plotted

698
00:46:13,384 --> 00:46:14,985
this attack for years.

699
00:46:15,053 --> 00:46:18,855
ANCHOR: Excuse me for
interrupting, Ms. Sutton,

700
00:46:18,923 --> 00:46:23,360
but are you at all worried about
the damage to your credibility?

701
00:46:23,428 --> 00:46:25,529
LAURA:
Of course I am.

702
00:46:27,432 --> 00:46:29,699
All I can do now
is learn from my mistake

703
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:34,037
and... hope to put it behind me
as quickly as possible.

704
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:43,046
Did he come at you hard?

705
00:46:43,114 --> 00:46:45,048
He did.

706
00:46:45,116 --> 00:46:47,384
A promotion?

707
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:49,419
Not exactly, but...

708
00:46:49,487 --> 00:46:50,253
What then?

709
00:46:50,321 --> 00:46:51,253
Stock options?

710
00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:52,589
(both chuckle)

711
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:54,090
Here, let me help
you with those.

712
00:46:54,157 --> 00:46:56,258
No, that's okay,
let me do that.

713
00:46:59,162 --> 00:47:01,931
You're being very discreet.

714
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:03,165
Are you considering his offer?

715
00:47:03,233 --> 00:47:06,168
You'd tell me if
I'm too nosy, huh?

716
00:47:06,236 --> 00:47:09,171
No, not at all.

717
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:11,207
Can I at least pour you
some more wine?

718
00:47:11,274 --> 00:47:13,375
Well, that-that
would be good.

719
00:47:19,617 --> 00:47:21,883
Thank you.

720
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:24,753
The truth is,
it was painful.

721
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:26,321
How so?

722
00:47:28,324 --> 00:47:30,258
Turning him down.

723
00:47:30,326 --> 00:47:33,095
Saul recruited me,
he trained me.

724
00:47:33,162 --> 00:47:36,598
He's pulled so many hatchets
out of my back, I've lost count.

725
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:40,802
We were a team,
we've always been a team.

726
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,804
And is that what you did?

727
00:47:42,872 --> 00:47:44,773
Turned him down?

728
00:47:46,876 --> 00:47:49,611
Yeah.

729
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:53,615
I don't know what's ahead, but
that chapter of my life is over.

730
00:47:53,682 --> 00:47:55,816
Finished.

731
00:47:55,884 --> 00:47:58,819
So you're ready to
hear another offer?

732
00:47:58,887 --> 00:48:00,655
I'd like to make one.

733
00:48:00,722 --> 00:48:02,823
I can't go back to work
right away, Otto.

734
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:04,692
I'm sorry.

735
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,993
Too much has happened.

736
00:48:06,061 --> 00:48:09,664
I need to take some time,
be a mom again for a while.

737
00:48:09,731 --> 00:48:12,332
Understand.

738
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,101
But I'm not talking
about your old job.

739
00:48:14,169 --> 00:48:15,602
No?

740
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:18,139
No. You've trained
your team well.

741
00:48:18,206 --> 00:48:19,774
Mike can take over.

742
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:22,108
What then?

743
00:48:22,177 --> 00:48:25,312
Over the years, I've hired
a lot of extraordinary people,

744
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:26,980
interviewed a lot more.

745
00:48:27,048 --> 00:48:28,649
Well, you're picky.

746
00:48:28,716 --> 00:48:30,384
(chuckling):
You're famous for it.

747
00:48:30,451 --> 00:48:33,153
Never anybody like you, though.

748
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:36,022
That's nice of you to say.

749
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:38,892
It's not nice.

750
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:40,561
I read your application,

751
00:48:40,628 --> 00:48:42,162
saw right away
how brilliant you are,

752
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:45,399
what a freethinker,

753
00:48:45,466 --> 00:48:47,167
and insisted on meeting you.

754
00:48:47,235 --> 00:48:48,835
I remember.

755
00:48:48,903 --> 00:48:53,706
We sat down at 10:15
on a Wednesday morning.

756
00:48:53,773 --> 00:48:56,909
I offered you the
position at 10:30.

757
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:59,679
I remember.

758
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:04,617
I was waiting for you, Carrie.

759
00:49:04,685 --> 00:49:07,753
I was waiting for you
to walk through the door.

760
00:49:10,224 --> 00:49:13,157
Okay, now I'm a little lost.

761
00:49:13,226 --> 00:49:15,993
I want a partner,

762
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:18,830
someone who knows the world
for what it is

763
00:49:18,897 --> 00:49:20,699
but also knows
it must be made better.

764
00:49:20,766 --> 00:49:23,368
Someone to share
my life with.

765
00:49:26,071 --> 00:49:27,872
Otto...

766
00:49:36,282 --> 00:49:38,250
You don't have
to answer now.

767
00:49:38,317 --> 00:49:40,252
Go back to America.

768
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,787
Spend time with your daughter.

769
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,456
Think about it.

770
00:49:47,793 --> 00:49:49,727
I-I don't know what to say.

771
00:49:49,795 --> 00:49:51,229
Say nothing.

772
00:49:51,296 --> 00:49:55,399
Just think about the scope
and scale of what I'm proposing.

773
00:49:55,467 --> 00:49:57,468
The possibilities.

774
00:49:59,838 --> 00:50:02,439
I'll be in Washington
next month for meetings.

775
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,448
We can talk then.

Laura, what's going on?

They just let me go.

What do you mean, you can't
talk to me? Why not?

782
00:50:42,446 --> 00:50:45,348
It's a condition
of the deal I made.

783
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:47,017
I can't talk to you ever again.

784
00:50:47,084 --> 00:50:49,019
What deal?

785
00:50:50,487 --> 00:50:52,555
Good-bye.
