that you are
a CIA operative,

152
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:08,075
and that you went on
a mission, a fact-finding
mission to Venezuela.

153
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:10,545
What? This is...

154
00:07:10,612 --> 00:07:13,014
Hear me out, okay?

155
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:14,749
You went there on
a fact-finding mission

156
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:16,551
to determine if
its government
was responsible

157
00:07:16,618 --> 00:07:18,986
for the assassination
attempt on
President Lyman.

158
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:21,789
You determined it was not,
and you informed
your bosses of this.

159
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:25,059
This is the stupidest
B.S. I have ever heard.

160
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:26,961
Wait, wait. What?
Can you...

161
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,696
How do I know
that you're from
the <i>Sun Times?</i>

162
00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:31,999
The White House ignored
your findings and launched
an attack anyway,

163
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,869
still claiming
retribution for the
assassination attempt.

164
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:37,638
I've been on the national
desk for five years.

165
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:40,841
I have a column
every Tuesday
on the editorial page.

166
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,044
My son goes to
school here, too.

167
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:45,245
Yeah, I know.
You said that.

168
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:50,918
You people.

169
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:53,454
You people! My God!
You fucking people!

170
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:57,324
You know, this isn't
about me. Once again,
it's about my husband.

171
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:58,726
My source is impeccable.

172
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:01,428
Your source is 110%
fucking peccable.

173
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,265
I'm a CIA operative?

174
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,735
I can't even use
the navigation system
in my Prius.

175
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:10,504
This is...
This is absurd!

176
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:14,208
Your paper... Your paper
has been trying to
fuck my husband

177
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:16,176
ever since he spoke out
against this administration.

178
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:17,812
We have your memo.
- What memo?

179
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,681
We have your findings.
- You know. My attorney
is Harry Timmers.

180
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:22,483
Do you know him?
- Sure.

181
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,752
He's gonna take a lead pipe
to you, and he's gonna
shove it up your ass.

182
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,221
Well, I certainly
don't want that.

183
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:30,891
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Our kids
go to school together, Robin.

184
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,960
Rachel Armstrong.
- Right. Whatever.

185
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:34,161
Are you denying
you're CIA?

186
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,164
You know what?
You stay away from us.

187
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:38,833
Okay? I mean it.

<i>Okay.</i>

204

00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:32,153
Sorry.
- Hey, what's that?

208
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,790
My son had to do a paper
on India. I was just
looking over his outline.

209
00:09:35,857 --> 00:09:39,359
I bet you he could give me
10 inches on India's nuclear
buildup with Pakistan.

210
00:09:39,427 --> 00:09:41,361
Oh, yeah.
- How'd you do with David?

211
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:44,398
"White House doesn't
comment on security
issues." Blah-blah.

212
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:47,935
Yeah, well, I know you'll
give it more eloquent
phrasing than "blah-blah."

213
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:49,870
Sure.
- Feels good, huh?

214
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:51,839
It's worth every
dime I don't make.

215
00:09:51,907 --> 00:09:55,309
Look, I want you
to start on a major
profile of Van Doren,

216
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:59,747
from Yale to CIA, to the
marriage to the ambassador
20 years older than her.

217
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:02,983
He was her professor.
He was married.
A whole drama, I hear.

218
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:05,186
Now, that's
some good stuff.

219
00:10:05,253 --> 00:10:08,723
Look, by the way,
you deserve
a good night's sleep.

220
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,926
If I were you, I'd turn the
ringers on my phone off.

221
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:15,629
(DOOR OPENS)

222
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,801
MERRILL: Hey, Erica.

223
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:23,838
Why are we meeting
here, Merrill?
- For the chili.

224
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:26,741
No. Why are we meeting
out in the open like this?

225
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:30,111
We're not out in
the open, Erica.
No one knows who you are.

226
00:10:30,178 --> 00:10:32,713
Now tomorrow, when that
goddamn story comes out,

227
00:10:32,781 --> 00:10:36,717
tomorrow you'll be
out in the open. Shit!

228
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:39,519
Your husband had to go
and write those articles,
didn't he?

229
00:10:39,587 --> 00:10:40,721
Keep him out of this.

230
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:44,324
You're right, Erica.
It's not Oscar's fault.

231
00:10:44,392 --> 00:10:47,027
Oscar hasn't been
trained in covert ops.

232
00:10:47,095 --> 00:10:49,029
Oscar didn't take
an oath of secrecy.

233
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:51,431
No, it's your fault.
You shouldn't have
told him anything.

234
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:55,469
Okay, hey, guys.
Here's the SITREP.

235
00:10:55,536 --> 00:10:58,906
The paper will be out
in two hours. They haven't
put it up on the Net.

236
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:00,641
They didn't want to
give the West Coast
papers a chance

237
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:03,377
to put it in their
morning editions.
And Justice is scrambling.

238
00:11:03,444 --> 00:11:06,947
They're bringing in
a special prosecutor to
find out who exposed you.

239
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:08,849
I can't believe this.

240
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:13,487
I mean, our kids go
to school together,

241
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:16,223
you know, the reporter's
kid and mine.

242
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,392
Wait a second.
You know her?

243
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:21,095
Well, I kind of
recognized her today,

244
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,563
but we'd never spoken
before that moment.

245
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:26,533
Let me ask you straight out,
Erica. Was it you?

246
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:29,536
Was it me, what?
- Was it you who leaked
to the <i>Sun Times?</i>

247
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:31,205
I mean,
it's understandable.

248
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:35,542
The White House
ignored your report,
and you got pissed.

249
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,378
You goaded Oscar to write
those quote-unquote,
opinion pieces.

250
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:40,347
When that didn't get
traction, you went to
the press yourself.

251
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,849
I went to the press myself.

252
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:44,584
Someone you knew.
Someone you trusted.

253
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:46,821
Fuck you.

254
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:49,389
Fuck me? Touche.

255
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:54,895
The prosecutor,
Patton Dubois,
he'll be in tomorrow.

256
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:56,563
He'll get Armstrong
before the grand jury.

257
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:58,565
Law says Armstrong has
to give up her source.

258
00:11:58,633 --> 00:11:59,900
Could it have been Oscar?

259
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:02,502
No. Could it have
been you, O'Hara?

260
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:06,907
How we all doing?
Still doing good?

261
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:08,209
Doing good.
- You sure?

262
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:10,477
Good.
- All right.

263
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:12,112
I'm gonna put you
on the box.
Oscar, too.

264
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,616
Fine. But I want everybody
in the agency who
knows my identity,

265
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:19,220
I want them with
polygraph wires
up their asses, too,

266
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:20,554
because there's
a traitor among us.

267
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:22,990
We'll find that person
if they're in the CIA.

268
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:26,293
Nonetheless, we should think
about relocating you
for your own good.

269
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:29,196
No. No. I will send Allison
away for a little while,

270
00:12:29,264 --> 00:12:33,500
but none of this shit
was my fault. I'm not
gonna be punished.

271
00:12:33,568 --> 00:12:35,970
This Lois Lane
and her newspaper,

272
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:38,505
I'm not gonna let her
turn me into
a scared little girl.

273
00:12:38,573 --> 00:12:40,241
Uh-uh. I'm staying here.

274
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:43,443
Whatever.

275
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:47,514
In the meantime,
we'll assign a protective
detail to your home.

276
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:51,485
I feel so much safer.
Thank you.

277
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:55,422
I can't fucking
believe this.

278
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:36,563
ALLISON: Mommy.

279
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:43,404
Wanna stay home
from school today?
- Yeah.

280
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:52,263
This is very interesting.
It's awesome.

281
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:56,234
Thank you.
- You're welcome. Wow.

282
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,635
I didn't realize they made
so much coffee in India.

283
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:00,905
It also has the most
democrats in the world.

284
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:04,441
Well, not quite.
India is the biggest
democracy in the world.

285
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:07,211
Isn't that the same thing?
No, it's not the same thing.

286
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,146
Jesus Christ.

287
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,786
Don't give your carrots
to Brandon today. Okay?

288
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,454
Okay, Mom.

289
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:21,658
You did it.

290
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:24,996
This changes everything.
You're gonna win a Pulitzer.

291
00:14:25,063 --> 00:14:26,163
(LAUGHS)

292
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:28,232
I don't know about that.

293
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:36,440
Timmy, come on.
Eat your breakfast.
- I don't like them.

294
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,609
Come on, don't give
Mommy a hard time.
Finish your eggs.

295
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:40,378
Eggs give you cancer.

296
00:14:40,445 --> 00:14:42,013
Eggs don't give you cancer.

297
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,917

as the special counsel
to investigate this leak
about Erica Van Doren.

340
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,253
That was fast.

341

Yeah, I know,
it's kind of unusual,

342
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:09,193
but the boys over at Justice
seem to think this is
a pretty urgent matter,

a not-a-second-to-lose
kind of thing.

344

So they called me
in last night,

345
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:18,536
and I just checked into
the hotel this morning,
and here we are.

The Attorney General's office
has to disqualify itself.

Maybe somebody over there
was your source, eh?

348
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:28,479
I think I should call
my lawyer.
- That's not necessary.

349
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,982
I'm not gonna be asking
you any questions.

Not here, anyway.
This is neither the

of an unofficial head start.

Sure.

Okay, good.
I'll do all the yada-yada.

357

Now, you were within
your rights to print the
information that you obtained.

358
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:05,116
However, you're not
within your rights

00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:09,720
to protect who it was
that gave Erica up to you,
who exposed her.

It's a 1982 law called
the Intelligence Identities
Protection Act.

Your source is in
a great deal of trouble.

362
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:18,862
I've no intention of
discussing my source...
- Hold on.

363
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,365
I'm doing the yada-yada,
remember?

364
00:18:21,866 --> 00:18:23,000
Okay.

365
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,237
Okay, look,

366
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:28,939
you're gonna be asked
to appear before
a grand jury.

367
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,008
You're gonna be asked
to identify your source.

368
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:32,409
I'll be doing the asking.

369
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:36,280
Now, if, for some reason,
you don't reveal your source,

370
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,216
you'll be held in contempt,
and that means jail time,

to protect you.

some form of protection

00:30:43,857 --> 00:30:47,160
you know, we're really
not equipped to deal
with a lot of craziness.

596
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:49,095
Okay.

597
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:52,198
I think it's idiotic,
is what it is. I understand,
the press can be a nightmare.

598
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:56,869
Maybe if you were to
stay away for a while,
then they would go away.

599
00:30:56,937 --> 00:31:00,440
I hope we can work this out,
Jerry. I really look forward
to reading to the kids.

600
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:03,143
I mean, I'm pretty good
at it, too. I do all
the little voices.

601
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,145
You are. So...

602
00:31:05,212 --> 00:31:08,681
When were you planning
on bringing Ali
back to school?

603
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,651
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

604
00:31:11,718 --> 00:31:14,154
I see. Okay.

605
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:21,561
Are you saying that she
can't come back, Jerry?

606
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,863
How was your lunch?
- Terrific. Thank you.

607
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,966
Yeah, what'd you have?
- I actually didn't
have anything.

608
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:28,734
Really?

609
00:31:28,802 --> 00:31:31,037
I wish I had
your will power.

610
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,208
Your source,
Miss Armstrong,
who is it?

611
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:42,315
Hey.

612
00:31:43,784 --> 00:31:45,552
Well? How did it go?

613
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:48,188
Okay, I guess.
Excuse me. Rachel Armstrong?

614
00:31:48,255 --> 00:31:50,323
Yes.
- I'm Deputy U.S.
Marshal Jones.

615
00:31:50,391 --> 00:31:52,958
I have a summons for you
to appear in US District
Court in two hours.

616
00:31:53,026 --> 00:31:55,428
No, no, no.
- What happened to two weeks?

617
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:56,663
Hey!

618
00:31:57,931 --> 00:31:59,532
I'm Avril Aaronson,

619
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,534
counsel to the
<i>Capital Sun Times.</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah,</i>

620
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:03,603
I read your amicus
brief on the Celeste
matter last year.

621
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,838
I think you could take
credit for her release.
I really do.

622
00:32:05,906 --> 00:32:08,575
I understand all the
theatrics up until now,
but this?

623
00:32:08,642 --> 00:32:10,976
This is too fast.
This is outrageous,

624
00:32:11,044 --> 00:32:13,779
and we're getting into
some pretty serious
Fifth Amendment issues here.

625
00:32:13,847 --> 00:32:19,686
Look, Avril, there's a traitor
out there revealing the
names of CIA operatives.

626
00:32:19,753 --> 00:32:24,424
Now, I think we should get
somebody like that out
<i>tout de suite.</i> Don't you?

627
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:26,726
We're bringing
in Albert Burnside.

628
00:32:26,793 --> 00:32:28,027
Oh...

629
00:32:28,095 --> 00:32:31,497
I'll have to go home
and get my autograph
book, then.

630
00:32:34,968 --> 00:32:36,202
AVRIL: Don't worry about it.
It's not a problem.

631
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,238
It's already in
the <i>Sun Times</i> budget.

632
00:32:38,305 --> 00:32:40,005
Hi, Avril.

633
00:32:40,073 --> 00:32:43,209
Hey, there he is. Albert,
thanks for coming.
This is Rachel Armstrong.

634
00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:44,810
Glad to meet you.
- Hi, me, too.

635
00:32:44,878 --> 00:32:47,747
Hey, I'm Ray, Rachel's
husband. Why is this
happening so fast?

636
00:32:47,814 --> 00:32:50,316
Avril said it'd be weeks
until I went before a judge.

637
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:54,454
Well, Mr. Dubois wants
to get this done before
the press catches up.

638
00:32:54,521 --> 00:32:57,290
It's okay. The press can
just complicate things.

639
00:32:57,358 --> 00:32:59,325
Let's concentrate on
keeping you out of jail.

640
00:32:59,393 --> 00:33:00,560
Jail? What do you... When?

641
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:02,194
You're gonna ask
for a continuance?

642
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:04,464
Yeah. Sure. Sure.

643
00:33:04,531 --> 00:33:07,700
Look, I've been through this.
Judge Hall is a good egg.

644
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:09,669
We exchange Christmas cards.

645
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,037
He's certainly not
gonna jail you today.

646
00:33:12,105 --> 00:33:13,473
Jesus Christ.
RACHEL: Ray, relax.

647
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,442
I mean, if Albert's
this calm, then we
can be, too. Right?

648
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,611
We'll be out of here
in five minutes.

649
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:22,282
Then we'll get a cup of
joe and we'll strategize
how we can protect you

650
00:33:22,349 --> 00:33:26,753
and the constitution
and democracy itself
for generations to come.

651
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:29,656
That's a Theory, right?

652
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:30,990
Yeah.
- It's classy.

653
00:33:31,057 --> 00:33:33,693
Thanks. Nice suit.

654
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:38,364
It's not a suit. It's
a Zegna. Hand stitched,
15 mil mil 15.

655
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:41,668
What's that
you're wearing?

656
00:33:43,337 --> 00:33:45,672
I don't know.

657
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:48,140
I'm putting you in
touch with my tailor.

658
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,177
You always know
when you're in a Zegna.

659
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:52,978
Court room three.

660
00:33:53,046 --> 00:33:57,216
Your Honor, this morning,
Miss Armstrong appeared
before the grand jury.

661
00:33:57,284 --> 00:33:59,485
I furnished you
with the transcripts.

662
00:33:59,553 --> 00:34:05,257
And as you know, she was
asked to reveal the name of
the source who provided her,

663
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:09,329
quite possibly illegally,
with secret information
revealing the...

664
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:11,698
Excuse me,
Your Honor. If I may?

665
00:34:11,765 --> 00:34:13,132
Yes.

666
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,301
All right?
It's perfectly okay with me.

667
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:17,704
Your Honor,
I just met my client.

668
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:22,408
I ask you to continue this
matter for, say, a week, so
we can get our bearings here.

669
00:34:22,476 --> 00:34:24,977
Let me get my bearings first.
Why don't we proceed for now?

670
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:26,612
Well, here's how it is,
Your Honor.

671
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:31,050
Mr. Dubois will say
that my client was asked
to name her source

672
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:34,387
and that she won't
do so, and, thus,
you should compel her.

673
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:38,791
He'll say that the
information that my client
received is highly classified

674
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:43,563
and the GJ is entitled
to know the name of the
source and to find it out.

675
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:48,033
He'll also say that there's
no federal shield law
protecting her

676
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:50,202
and that there's no First
Amendment protection, either,

677
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:54,306
because this is a matter of,
quote-unquote,
national security.

678
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:56,208
JUDGE: Is that about right,
Mr. Dubois?

679
00:34:56,276 --> 00:34:57,910
In fact, that's it
in a nutshell.

680
00:34:57,978 --> 00:35:02,515
We contend that the
First Amendment does
protect Rachel Armstrong.

681
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:06,318
I'm well aware of cases
in this circuit in which
this contention is...

682
00:35:06,387 --> 00:35:09,221
Well, I am aware
of those cases
in this circuit,

683
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:13,926
and they do not authorize
her to refuse to
respond to these questions.

684
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:16,295
Why don't the three of you
come up here right now?

685
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:18,631
Rachel, Rachel,
come on. Come on up.

686
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:24,837
ALBERT: Over here
to where the bench is.

687
00:35:24,905 --> 00:35:27,139
JUDGE: Miss Armstrong,
I want you to understand

688
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:31,444
that if I should order you
to reveal your source,

689
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:36,516
that if you don't do so,
I'm gonna hold you
in contempt of court

690
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:39,018
and that you will
be jailed until you...

691
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:40,720
Hold on, Your Honor.

692
00:35:40,788 --> 00:35:44,056
Can you rule, please,
on my request for
a continuance?

693
00:35:44,124 --> 00:35:46,559
Right. I'm gonna
deny that motion.

694
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:48,428
I'm only asking for
a few days, Judge.

695
00:35:48,495 --> 00:35:50,329
I understand.
There is a serious
national security...

696
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:52,865
There's no reason
not to grant a continuance.

697
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:55,468
Let me run my courtroom.

698
00:35:57,438 --> 00:36:03,275
Now, Miss Armstrong,
I direct you to reveal the
identity of your source.

699
00:36:03,343 --> 00:36:07,179
If you want a few
days to consider it,
I'll give it to you.

700
00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:09,882
I can't do that.

701
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,319
Mr. Burnside, if you want
a few days to advise
her to obey my order.

702
00:36:13,386 --> 00:36:16,522
I can't advise my client
to betray a confidence.

703
00:36:17,257 --> 00:36:18,624
Okay, look, Your Honor,

704
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:21,561
given the direct threat
to our national security,

705
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:25,498
I ask that Miss Armstrong
now be held in
contempt of court

706
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:29,635
and that she be
jailed immediately.

707
00:36:29,703 --> 00:36:35,207
JUDGE: Well, it seems to me
that I have before me somebody
who is defying my order

708
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:39,745
and who seems to
believe that she is
above the law itself.

709
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:41,781
I hold you in
contempt of court,

710
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:46,051
and I remand you to
the custody of the
United States Marshal.

711
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,687
Help.
ALBERT: Judge...

712
00:36:47,754 --> 00:36:50,556
Wait. No, no. Your Honor.
Judge. Wait... No, wait.

713
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:52,625
Ma'am.
- Your Honor!

714
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:55,060
JUDGE: As soon as you're
prepared to speak,
you will be released.

715
00:36:55,128 --> 00:36:56,696
Could I have a minute
with my client to confer?

716
00:36:56,763 --> 00:36:58,598
You may consult with her
in the detention center.

717
00:36:58,665 --> 00:37:01,567
Timmy needs to be
picked up from the
Hobermans' at 5:30.

718
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:03,369
This proceeding is closed.
Judge.

719
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:06,806
Judge. Your Honor!

720
00:37:06,874 --> 00:37:10,409
A lot of people looking
to get famous here.

721
00:37:10,477 --> 00:37:11,944
So now what?
What do we do now?

722
00:37:12,012 --> 00:37:13,546
I'll call you tomorrow.
Don't worry about it.

723
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:15,681
What are you gonna do now?
- I'm gonna call you
in the morning.

724
00:37:15,749 --> 00:37:17,917
All right? Okay?

725
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,887
Well, at least you'll
take him off your
Christmas card list. Right?

726
00:37:20,954 --> 00:37:22,755
That's right.

727
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,625
It's a scare tactic.
- You think?

728
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:27,426
I'll deal with it.
I'll see you back
at the paper.

729
00:37:27,494 --> 00:37:30,162
Okay, I'll head over there.

730
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:34,734
Mr. Burnside, this is
a real honor for me.

731
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:37,970
I studied you, growing up.
My dad was also a lawyer.

732
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:41,206
This is a big,
big mistake, Patton.

733
00:37:41,274 --> 00:37:43,175
Well, there's nothing like
learning from our mistakes.

734
00:37:43,243 --> 00:37:47,747
Yeah, well, sometimes
a mistake is like wearing
white after Labor Day,

735
00:37:47,814 --> 00:37:51,283
and sometimes,
a mistake is invading
Russia in winter.

736
00:37:52,419 --> 00:37:53,419
Hmm.

737
00:38:23,984 --> 00:38:27,019
Okay, there are two things
I need to know.

738
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:29,722
First, the story itself.
- Rock solid.

739
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,692
Rock solid. Well,
are we talking talc or
are we talking granite?

740

<i>not once.</i>

887
00:46:49,789 --> 00:46:52,691
But this is...
This is getting crazy.

888
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:57,129
<i>Okay, let's not</i>

889
00:46:57,196 --> 00:46:59,465
<i>You don't trust me?</i>
<i>- That's not the point.</i>

890
00:46:59,532 --> 00:47:00,699

<i>Okay. I miss you.</i>

00:47:12,612 --> 00:47:15,714
I miss you, too.
Can you pass
the phone back to...

895
00:47:15,782 --> 00:47:17,816
<i>Hey, can you hear me?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

896
00:47:17,884 --> 00:47:20,653

00:47:35,168 --> 00:47:39,171
RAY: She can't hear you,

home soon. Come on.

00:47:55,488 --> 00:47:57,956
<i>COURT BAILIFF: All rise.</i>
<i>Hear ye, hear ye.</i>

905
00:48:13,906 --> 00:48:18,610
Mr. Burnside, your client
is here now, so you may
proceed when you're ready.

906
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:20,612
Thank you, sir.

907
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,516
Your Honor, I would ask
that you would
release Ms. Armstrong

908
00:48:24,584 --> 00:48:27,185
until such time as
the U.S. Court of Appeals
can rule

909
00:48:27,253 --> 00:48:29,488
on the validity of
this contempt citation.

910
00:48:29,556 --> 00:48:31,022
Now that would vitiate
the whole purpose

911
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:34,159
of her incarceration
in the first place.

912
00:48:34,227 --> 00:48:35,927
She has the key
to her own cell.

913
00:48:35,995 --> 00:48:40,131
A key that comes in the
form of a loss of integrity
is no key at all.

914
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:41,933
Integrity is subjective.

915
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:45,136
Miss Armstrong,
I'm sympathetic, but
you've gotta help me out.

916
00:48:45,204 --> 00:48:47,639
Will you represent to
me that if you're home

917
00:48:47,707 --> 00:48:52,010
that you'll pick up the
phone and call or contact
your source

918
00:48:52,078 --> 00:48:55,714
and try to get permission
for you to release
the source's name

919
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:58,183
so we can put
an end to all of this?

920
00:48:58,251 --> 00:49:01,119
I would be dishonest
if I said I could do that.

921
00:49:01,187 --> 00:49:03,522
Well, then, you're really not
giving me any basis at all.

922
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:04,757
The motion is denied.

923
00:49:04,824 --> 00:49:08,560
Sir, I would ask
that the court now

924
00:49:08,628 --> 00:49:13,131
impose a fine of $10,000
a day against the <i>Sun Times</i>

925
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,468
until such time
as Miss Armstrong's
source be revealed.

926
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,903
Your Honor,

927
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,905
with all due respect to you,
this court and Miss Armstrong,

928
00:49:19,972 --> 00:49:21,573
we don't know
who her source is.

929
00:49:21,641 --> 00:49:23,475
I don't see how we could
be held accountable.

930
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:26,745
Sir, obviously, with
the representation
on display here,

931
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:29,915
obviously, the paper
not only supports,

932
00:49:29,982 --> 00:49:33,385
but is encouraging
Miss Armstrong's position.

933
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:35,387
They're enabling her.

934
00:49:35,455 --> 00:49:38,657
The <i>Sun Times</i> should
be obliged to obey
Your Honor,

935
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,992
and dismiss Miss Armstrong
if she does not.

936
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,094
That is out of line!

937
00:49:43,162 --> 00:49:46,732
Your Honor, respectfully,
I ask you to deny this motion.

938
00:50:04,283 --> 00:50:07,853
Don't even think of buckling.
Don't even think it.

939
00:50:08,888 --> 00:50:10,522
You pay the fine,

940
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:14,693
and you let Rachel hold
strong, exactly the
way she's been doing.

941
00:50:18,064 --> 00:50:20,231
You didn't need
to say that.

945

You know, my daddy
is buried right over there.

947
00:50:46,158 --> 00:50:48,660
I feel it best that
we not meet at Langley

948
00:50:48,728 --> 00:50:50,562
for the time being.
- Yeah. Okay.

949
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,831
Yeah. You know,
I'm just glad that you
asked to see me.

950
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:55,901
I've been wanting to
speak to you
since this all broke.

951
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,504
You know, I was hoping
I'd convince you

952
00:50:58,571 --> 00:51:02,307
to give me a crack
at the CBD in the Balkans.

953
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:05,443
There's other business
to attend to first.
- Okay.

all of those people
who were aware
of your cover.

956
00:51:09,448 --> 00:51:12,618
We've looked at
phone records,
emails, the works.

957
00:51:12,685 --> 00:51:14,319
We're dead ending here.
- Really?

958
00:51:14,387 --> 00:51:17,088
So far, the reporter is
in jail and not talking.

959
00:51:17,156 --> 00:51:20,759
It's essential we find out
where this leak came from.

960
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,362
I know. I understand.
You know, and I couldn't
agree with you more.

961
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:28,299
You know, we don't know if
this person had it in for you
or had it in for the agency,

962
00:51:28,367 --> 00:51:29,902
so can I just pick
your brain a little bit?

963
00:51:29,969 --> 00:51:32,103
Yeah, of course. Please.
I completely understand.

964
00:51:32,171 --> 00:51:33,405
Ask me whatever you want.

965
00:51:33,472 --> 00:51:35,741
When did you first meet
Rachel Armstrong?

966
00:51:35,808 --> 00:51:38,476
Knowingly?
When she came to me
at the soccer game,

967
00:51:38,545 --> 00:51:40,245
when she confronted me.

968
00:51:40,312 --> 00:51:43,949
And you're both volunteers
at Potomac Shores
Elementary School, right?

969
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:49,521
I am. Well, no, I'm not.
I was, but I'm not now,

970
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:51,256
but she was a room
mother there, she said.

971
00:51:51,323 --> 00:51:53,458
You never met at school
functions before that?

972
00:51:53,526 --> 00:51:56,094
No.
- Your volunteer work
never overlapped?

973
00:51:56,162 --> 00:51:58,897
You guys never perhaps
talked mom to mom?

974
00:51:58,965 --> 00:52:00,465
No. No.

975
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:05,136
Ever go to a school
event where alcohol
was being served?

976
00:52:05,204 --> 00:52:07,773
What? What?

977
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,541
You know, when my wife
went to those functions,

978
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:12,578
those
let-your-hair-down
things,

979
00:52:12,645 --> 00:52:17,082
my God, I can't tell you the
things she said that she now
wishes she could take back.

980
00:52:17,149 --> 00:52:18,784
Sir, wait.

981
00:52:20,853 --> 00:52:23,789
Are you still
investigating me?

982
00:52:23,856 --> 00:52:25,657
Well...
- I just passed a polygraph.

983
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,126
Well, given your training,
I'm not sure how
valuable that is.

984
00:52:28,194 --> 00:52:32,764
It is a clinical
investigation. You don't
need to take it personally.

985
00:52:32,832 --> 00:52:35,067
I don't need to
take it personally?

986
00:52:35,134 --> 00:52:38,403
"We think that you're
either incompetent,
a drunk, or a liar,

987
00:52:38,471 --> 00:52:41,306
"but you don't need
to take it personally."

988
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:44,743
How dare you?

989
00:52:45,712 --> 00:52:46,912
How fucking dare you?

990
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,413
Okay, you need to watch
your tone here, Erica.

991
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:50,148
Let me ask you
a question, sir.

992
00:52:50,216 --> 00:52:53,318
What, in my absolutely
unblemished record,
can you point to and say,

993
00:52:53,385 --> 00:52:56,187
"Yeah, yeah,
that's somebody
we can't trust"?

994
00:52:56,255 --> 00:52:57,489
What?

995
00:52:57,556 --> 00:53:01,059
Point is, I don't
even know you.

996
00:53:01,127 --> 00:53:02,861
You've been a NOC
for so many years,

997
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,830
there are very few people
who actually know you.

998
00:53:04,897 --> 00:53:07,432
Okay, well, you know what?
I know you. I know you, sir.

999
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,269
I know your type.
I see where this is going.
I smell it.

1000
00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:13,005
You know, if somebody
in the CIA messed up,

1001
00:53:13,072 --> 00:53:14,873
somebody messed up,
gave me up

1002
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:18,110
and now you guys are walking
around investigating it
like the Keystone Kops.

1003
00:53:18,177 --> 00:53:21,146
You're just aching
for it to be me. I see it.

1004
00:53:21,213 --> 00:53:24,516
This way you can tell
the press, "You know what?
It's not a rogue agent.

1005
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:27,719
"It is just some silly little
girl whose feelings got hurt

1006
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,688
"that her investigative
conclusions were ignored

1007
00:53:29,756 --> 00:53:31,256
"by the President
of the United States."

1008
00:53:31,323 --> 00:53:33,525
Findings that
absolved Venezuela

1009
00:53:33,592 --> 00:53:36,594
from having anything at all
to do with the assassination
attempt on him.

1010
00:53:36,663 --> 00:53:39,064
Now you're being
dramatic, Erica.
- Fine, okay.

1011
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,267
You know what?
You can speak to my
attorney from now on.

1012
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:44,002
You can drop my
protective detail.

1013
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:46,772
You can stop cutting me
checks. Okay? I quit.

1014
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:48,640
You don't just quit, Erica.

1015
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:52,310
Really? What is this,
<i>The Sopranos?</i> I can't leave
the family? I'm stuck?

1016
00:53:52,378 --> 00:53:55,681
Well, it's a process.
You're full of
privileged information.

1017
00:53:55,748 --> 00:53:59,317
You don't trust me?
Fine, okay.

1018
00:53:59,385 --> 00:54:02,520
I'm gonna give you
reason not to. Okay?

1019
00:54:02,588 --> 00:54:04,956
My husband's not the only one
in the family who can write.

1020
00:54:05,024 --> 00:54:08,126
Look, you sure you want
to get in a war with
the government, Erica?

1021
00:54:08,194 --> 00:54:09,761
Do you need the messiness?

1022
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,396
You're in the middle
of a custody battle, right?

1023
00:54:11,463 --> 00:54:16,334
You sure you want to
drag Allison into
the middle of all this?

1024
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:18,603
You are so lucky
you are a woman.

1025
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:19,971
Why is that?

1026
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,507
Because I don't hit girls.

1027
00:54:22,575 --> 00:54:27,645
You know, you weren't
the only agent investigating
the Venezuelans,

1028
00:54:27,714 --> 00:54:29,547
but you were the only
one that concluded

1029
00:54:29,615 --> 00:54:33,118

I must say, when I

1161
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,889

I mean, I haven't grown
accustomed to it.

You're married to the

How is the marriage
holding up?

1165
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:57,238
Well, obviously,
it puts pressure...
- It must be very hard.

1166
01:02:57,306 --> 01:03:00,308
It is hard.
But we're strong.

1167
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:03,511
You know,
he's very supportive of me,

1168
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,780
and we're best friends.
That really helps.

1169
01:03:06,948 --> 01:03:10,185
And what about your son?
Timothy.

It's been a long time.

1172
01:03:19,511 --> 01:03:20,711
How long?

1173
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:27,951
He came to see me when
I was first brought here,

1174
01:03:29,154 --> 01:03:32,523
but I have asked that he
not visit me in this place.

1175
01:03:34,493 --> 01:03:36,226
Well, that must be brutal.

Most mothers, though,
are going to have a
hard time understanding.

1177

I guess I would have, too,

1178
01:03:44,035 --> 01:03:46,136
but most mothers
would have no idea
what they would do

1179
01:03:46,204 --> 01:03:48,906
unless they were
in my position.

1180

The truth is, bringing Timmy
here would be selfish.

You know,
it would be for me.

if I can survive another
day not seeing him,

1183

but I know Timmy,

1184
01:04:12,364 --> 01:04:16,567

Rachel, let's get
to the meat of it,
because I have to try.

1189
01:04:35,354 --> 01:04:40,991
On your story, on uncovering
the identity of the CIA
agent Erica Van Doren,

1190
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:42,993
who was your source?

1191
01:04:44,529 --> 01:04:48,131
Well, Molly, let me ask you.
Why do you have to try?

1192
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:51,435
Try to get a fellow journalist
to betray her integrity?

1193
01:04:51,503 --> 01:04:54,855
I know you know
better than that.
I know you do.

1194
01:04:54,923 --> 01:04:58,058
Before the cameras rolled,
you said you were,
quote-unquote, with me.

1195
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:00,894
Look, I have empathy.
Like you, I would never
give up a source.

1196
01:05:00,962 --> 01:05:03,131
But you know what?
Sometimes sources
have motives.

1197
01:05:03,198 --> 01:05:04,698
Right, okay.

1198
01:05:04,766 --> 01:05:07,735
If the information
they're giving is
valuable and truthful,

1199
01:05:07,802 --> 01:05:12,273
like with Watergate or the
Pentagon Papers, then their
motives really don't matter.

1200
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:15,876
Any real journalist would
be prepared to put up
with the discomfort of jail

1201
01:05:15,944 --> 01:05:18,579

You know,
Ray is a great father,
and Timmy's gonna be okay,

1320
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,811
but that will not be
the case with my source.

1321
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:15,448
My source will be publicly
saddled with the death
of Erica Van Doren,

1322
01:14:15,516 --> 01:14:17,051
and that, I promise you,

1323
01:14:17,118 --> 01:14:18,852
will mean the destruction
of the person
we're talking about,

1324
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:21,421
and that, Albert,
that is not fair.

1325
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:25,025
AVRIL: Why?

1326
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:30,731
I mean, your source knew
full well the ramifications
of speaking to you.

1327
01:14:33,968 --> 01:14:38,505
My source didn't know
what they were doing

1328
01:14:38,573 --> 01:14:40,774
when I got the information.

1329
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:46,046
Was he drunk?
Was he talking in his sleep?

1330
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:47,948
Hey, take a fucking walk.

1331
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:50,084
We're trying to swim
a fucking waterfall
here, Albert.

1332

We have a responsibility
to the shareholders
not to go bankrupt.

1333
01:14:52,587 --> 01:14:55,488
If you're so worried
about that, then I'll go
pro bono from here on in.

1334
01:14:55,556 --> 01:14:58,192
How about that?
- Sold.

Okay. I just got
off the phone.

1338
01:15:07,568 --> 01:15:10,971
Stan Riggens has agreed
to speak to the grand jury.

1339
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,241
I guess signing that
waiver spooked him.

1340
01:15:14,308 --> 01:15:15,408
Stan?

1341
01:15:17,245 --> 01:15:19,079
I owe that kid in
my office 10 bucks.

1342
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:20,814
When is all this
supposed to happen?

1343
01:15:20,882 --> 01:15:24,551
As soon as possible.
It'll have to wait until
tomorrow morning.

1344
01:15:24,619 --> 01:15:27,755
Once he confirms
he was your source,
you're off the hook.

1345
01:15:27,822 --> 01:15:29,890
Pack your bags, Rachel.

1346
01:15:33,494 --> 01:15:36,513
You were chief of staff
to the Vice President.

I resigned
11 months ago.

1348
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:42,853
And were you the source
of information provided

1349
01:15:42,921 --> 01:15:46,924
on the October 6th edition
of the <i>Capital Sun Times</i>

1350
01:15:46,991 --> 01:15:51,528
in which the identity
of the covert CIA
agent was revealed?

1351
01:15:52,396 --> 01:15:54,097
STAN: I was.

1352
01:15:54,165 --> 01:15:58,902
Can you tell us all
how that came about?

1353
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:04,507
Well, I guess I was just
so angry at Erica Van Doren
and her husband,

1354
01:16:04,575 --> 01:16:06,376
my emotions got
the better of me.

1355
01:16:06,444 --> 01:16:08,912
I'm not interested
in your motivations.

1356
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:12,615
I want to know how
you came to reveal
this information.

How are you?

01:16:29,234 --> 01:16:33,303
Can I get a beer, please?
Good. Great.
Just here with my son.

1363

They're cute now,
but they grow up.
You know?

1364
01:16:37,608 --> 01:16:39,476
So I've been reading.

1365
01:16:39,543 --> 01:16:42,512
So I heard Glen invited you.
It's good to see you.

1366
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:46,783
Yeah, and you thought,
"Well, how can I pass
up this opportunity?"

1367
01:16:46,851 --> 01:16:49,353
That is exactly
what I thought.

1368
01:16:52,957 --> 01:16:55,926
Can I ask you a question?
- Anything.

1369

Ambassador Van Doren.

1370
01:16:57,328 --> 01:16:59,462
What about him?
- His wife.

1371
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:01,564
Is she a spook, Stan?

Come here.

1374

Now, look, you did not
hear this from me.
- Of course not.

1375
01:17:15,746 --> 01:17:17,647
Not from me.
- Absolutely not.

1376
01:17:17,715 --> 01:17:21,952
But, everybody knows
she's at the CIA. Everybody.

1377
01:17:23,021 --> 01:17:25,022
But you can't use that.

1378

Hey, I won't say it came
from you, but we're
not off the record.

Everybody knows anyway.
Common knowledge.

1382
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,735
Do you know if she
happened to get out
to Venezuela at all?

1383
01:17:38,803 --> 01:17:41,071
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1384
01:17:41,139 --> 01:17:46,709
She came to you
and asked you if
Ms. Van Doren was a spy?

1385
01:17:48,779 --> 01:17:51,081
She already knew.

1386
01:17:51,149 --> 01:17:53,150
That's right.

1387
01:17:53,217 --> 01:17:54,918
ALBERT: They're not satisfied
with Riggens.

1388
01:17:54,986 --> 01:17:57,254
He was just your
corroborative source.

1389
01:17:57,322 --> 01:18:00,857
So was the FBI guy
who gave you her report.

1390
01:18:00,925 --> 01:18:04,561

source, which puts us
back at square one.

longer can this go on?

before the grand jury
is required to disband,

1393
01:18:11,869 --> 01:18:14,338
and then Dubois can just
order up a new one.

Details? Yeah.

The details are
you're in here,

and whatever it is
keeping you in here

than what's on the outside.

Well, how long have
you been seeing her?

When you're fucking her,
what do you do with Timmy?

He's with a sitter
when we go out.

1415
01:20:58,219 --> 01:21:00,853
Has he met her?
- No.

Do I know her?
- You don't know her.
I told you that.

hear any more.

to do to keep me,

to keep my respect,
is just tell me
it means nothing.

Something you should know
is I speak only the best
about you to him.

All right, don't
patronize me. Okay?

1469
01:24:40,558 --> 01:24:42,926
Are the doctors saying
you're gonna be all right?

1470
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:45,028
Yeah. Whatever
that means.

1471
01:24:51,201 --> 01:24:57,874
You know, I'm the most
senior prisoner in this jail.

1472
01:24:57,942 --> 01:25:01,344
I've had 32 different bunk
mates since I've been here.

1473
01:25:02,747 --> 01:25:05,148
I gotta say,
that's a record.

1474
01:25:10,688 --> 01:25:12,656
Is that a new tie?

1475
01:25:12,723 --> 01:25:17,460
No, I've had it a while.
Domenico Vacca.

1476
01:25:17,528 --> 01:25:19,829
I took you for
a Kenneth Cole man.

1477
01:25:19,897 --> 01:25:21,364
Kenneth Cole?

1478
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,769
Well, I'm glad you retained
your sense of humor.

1479
01:25:30,174 --> 01:25:33,443
You look like a woman
who could use
some good news.

1480
01:25:35,112 --> 01:25:36,746
It's great news.

1481
01:25:41,285 --> 01:25:43,720
They've agreed.
They're going to
take your case.

1482
01:25:43,788 --> 01:25:46,623
It's gonna be an
expedited hearing.

1483
01:25:52,496 --> 01:25:55,465
<i>JUDGE: The next case this</i>
<i>morning is in re Armstrong.</i>

1484
01:25:55,532 --> 01:25:58,267
We'll hear first
from Mr. Burnside.

1485
01:26:01,038 --> 01:26:04,708
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court.

1486
01:26:04,775 --> 01:26:08,144
In 1972 in
<i>Branzburg v. Hayes,</i>

1487
01:26:08,212 --> 01:26:12,716
this court ruled
against the right
of reporters

1488
01:26:12,783 --> 01:26:17,053
to withhold the names
of their sources
before a grand jury,

1489
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:21,124
and it gave the power
to the government

1490
01:26:21,191 --> 01:26:24,594
to imprison those
reporters who did.

1491
01:26:24,662 --> 01:26:27,363
It was a five-four
decision. Close.

1492
01:26:29,366 --> 01:26:32,435
In his dissent in Branzburg,
Justice Stewart said,

1493
01:26:32,503 --> 01:26:35,204
"As the years pass,

1494
01:26:35,272 --> 01:26:39,009
"the power of government
becomes more
and more pervasive."

1495
01:26:39,076 --> 01:26:43,179
"Those in power," he said,
"whatever their politics,

1496
01:26:43,247 --> 01:26:45,381
"want only to perpetuate it

1497
01:26:47,151 --> 01:26:49,819
"and the people
are the victims."

1498
01:26:49,887 --> 01:26:55,992
Well, the years have passed,
and that power is pervasive.

1499
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:59,796
Ms. Armstrong could have
buckled to the demands
of the government.

1500
01:26:59,864 --> 01:27:02,498
She could have
abandoned her promise
of confidentiality.

1501
01:27:02,566 --> 01:27:06,235
She could have simply
gone home to her family.

1502
01:27:06,303 --> 01:27:09,205
But to do so

1503
01:27:09,273 --> 01:27:12,241
would mean that no source
would ever speak to her again,

1504
01:27:12,309 --> 01:27:16,112
and no source would ever speak
to her newspaper again,

1505
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:21,551
and then tomorrow when
we lock up journalists
from other newspapers,

1506
01:27:21,618 --> 01:27:24,821
we'll make those publications
irrelevant as well,

1507
01:27:26,891 --> 01:27:31,828
and thus we'll make
the First Amendment
irrelevant.

1508
01:27:31,896 --> 01:27:36,365
And then how will we know
if a president has
covered up crimes?

1509
01:27:36,433 --> 01:27:40,503
Or if an army officer
has condoned torture?

1510
01:27:42,472 --> 01:27:48,111
We, as a nation, will no
longer be able to hold
those in power accountable

1511
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:50,513
to those whom
they have power over.

1512
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:55,952
And what then is the
nature of government

1513
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,654
when it has no fear
of accountability?

1514
01:28:00,991 --> 01:28:03,392
We should shudder
at the thought.

1515
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:08,397
Imprisoning journalists?
That's for other countries.

1516
01:28:10,434 --> 01:28:13,569
That's for countries
who fear their citizens,

1517
01:28:15,472 --> 01:28:18,674
not countries that cherish
and protect them.

1518
01:28:21,846 --> 01:28:23,479
Some time ago,

1519
01:28:23,547 --> 01:28:30,353
I began to feel the
personal human pressure
on Rachel Armstrong,

1520
01:28:32,623 --> 01:28:38,527
and I told her that I was
there to represent her
and not a principle.

1521
01:28:44,668 --> 01:28:49,672
And it was not until
I met her that I realized
that with great people,

1522
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:56,345
there's no difference
between principle
and the person.

1523
01:29:11,912 --> 01:29:14,246
Come on. I got
new digs for you.

1524
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:21,120
ALBERT: You know, they
brought him out here...
JUDGE: It's nothing.

1525
01:29:21,188 --> 01:29:22,989
He's not
a real person here.

1526
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:24,791
Soccer isn't
a real thing here.
- They don't respond
to it the same way.

1527
01:29:24,858 --> 01:29:27,927
Judge, good afternoon.
- It's just not.

1528
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:30,663
Good afternoon,
thanks for coming over.

1529
01:29:30,731 --> 01:29:33,265
Mr. Burnside.

1530
01:29:33,333 --> 01:29:36,703
We're talking about
soccer not law.
Just want you to know.

1531
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:39,672
Look, the reason I asked
the two of you to come
over here today

1532
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:43,542
is that the Supremes
have decided your case.

1533
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:45,712
The ruling will be
down on Monday,

1534
01:29:45,779 --> 01:29:50,249
but I've been told by
a confidential source
what it is,

1535
01:29:50,317 --> 01:29:53,152
and I wanted to
share it with you.

1536
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:56,656
Five-four, opinion
against you, Albert.

1537
01:29:56,724 --> 01:30:01,094
Same as before.
National security,
First Amendment,

1538
01:30:01,161 --> 01:30:04,697
the court went with
national security.

1539
01:30:04,765 --> 01:30:08,300
And I want to say to you,
Patton, congratulations.
You did a great job.

1540
01:30:08,368 --> 01:30:10,336
The court once again

1541
01:30:10,403 --> 01:30:15,474
has made clear that in
a case where journalists
are not cooperative,

1542
01:30:15,542 --> 01:30:17,510
they may have
to be incarcerated.

1543
01:30:17,577 --> 01:30:19,345
Well, thank you, sir.

1544
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:22,515
That having been said,

1545
01:30:23,651 --> 01:30:25,852
I've decided to let her go.

1546
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:32,825
I'm sorry, sir. What?

1547
01:30:32,893 --> 01:30:36,763
I've gotta let her go.
I've been doing this
a lot of years now,

1548
01:30:36,830 --> 01:30:42,135
and I am sure that
this woman is not going
to reveal her source.

1549
01:30:42,202 --> 01:30:44,904
She's been locked up
for almost a year.

1550
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:47,640
She has been beaten
within an inch of her life.

1551
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:52,045
She is resolute.
- That's exactly right.
Exactly right.

1552
01:30:52,112 --> 01:30:56,683
I can only keep her in jail
if I think doing so will get
her to reveal her source.

1553
01:30:56,750 --> 01:31:00,953
She's not going to talk.
I really have no choice
but to let her go.

1554
01:31:01,021 --> 01:31:02,955
If I may. This is a...

1555
01:31:03,023 --> 01:31:06,693
This is a woman
who's been protecting
a criminal.

1556
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:08,294
That makes her a criminal.

1557
01:31:08,361 --> 01:31:11,630
Oh, come on.
She's not a criminal,

1558
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:13,199
and she won't be a criminal

1559
01:31:13,266 --> 01:31:18,071
unless she is duly charged
and duly convicted by a jury,

1560
01:31:18,138 --> 01:31:20,840
and that's not my call.

1561
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:22,641
When are you gonna
sign the paperwork,
Your Honor?

1562
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:24,210
I want to get her out
of there right away.

1563
01:31:24,277 --> 01:31:25,511
I'm gonna go to court
Monday morning.

1564
01:31:25,579 --> 01:31:29,148
I'm gonna announce
that I'm freeing her.

1565
01:31:29,216 --> 01:31:31,383
And, Patton,
you got a choice. You can
beat me to the punch.

1566
01:31:31,451 --> 01:31:33,753
Just dissolve the grand jury.

1567
01:31:36,056 --> 01:31:39,092
PATTON: As I'm sure your
attorney has informed you,

1568
01:31:39,159 --> 01:31:41,194
the grand jury has
been disbanded.

1569
01:31:41,261 --> 01:31:43,262
We're gonna have to
wait till midnight
to let you go.

1570
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:45,231
ALBERT: Midnight?

1571
01:31:45,298 --> 01:31:49,435
What? You're keeping
the reporters away
from your losing cause?

1572
01:31:49,502 --> 01:31:51,971
Rachel,
I know almost all of it.

1573
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:57,977
I am indicting two
government officials
for talking to you.

1574
01:31:58,045 --> 01:32:01,781
I wish I knew who it was
that first tipped you off,

1575
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:04,183
but I'm not gonna
get greedy.

1576
01:32:07,687 --> 01:32:09,889
I'm losing custody
of my kid.

1577
01:32:12,926 --> 01:32:15,161
You want the
wedding ring?

1578
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:16,863
Kind of a trophy.

1579
01:32:19,099 --> 01:32:22,235
You know, vilify me
if you want, Rachel,

1580
01:32:22,302 --> 01:32:24,771
but I had a job to do,

1581
01:32:24,838 --> 01:32:27,606
and I had every right
to do what I did.

1582
01:32:27,674 --> 01:32:31,744
I think you're confusing
your rights with your
power, Mr. Dubois.

1583
01:32:45,292 --> 01:32:46,659
It's okay.

1584
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:53,266
We booked you a room
at the Mayflower,

1585
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:56,635
but you know you're
welcome to stay with me
as long as you need.

1586
01:32:56,703 --> 01:32:58,938
Thank you. Thanks.

1587
01:32:59,006 --> 01:33:00,006
Sure.

1588
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:03,009
I spoke to Ray.

1589
01:33:03,076 --> 01:33:05,144
He's gonna bring Timmy by
first thing in the morning.

1590
01:33:05,212 --> 01:33:08,080
Thought maybe
you would like to
take him to school?

1591
01:33:08,148 --> 01:33:09,415
Yeah.

1592
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:14,620
That's okay?
- Yeah.

1593
01:33:15,555 --> 01:33:17,356
That'd be amazing.

1594
01:33:17,424 --> 01:33:19,625
God, I'm gonna scare
him to death, though.

1595
01:33:22,896 --> 01:33:27,666
And, well, you let me
know what you want to
do in terms of work.

1596
01:33:27,734 --> 01:33:29,401
You can if you want to.

1597
01:33:29,469 --> 01:33:32,371
No one's going to pressure
you about writing
about your experiences.

1598
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:35,541
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)

1599
01:33:35,608 --> 01:33:36,909
Oh, please.

1600
01:33:36,977 --> 01:33:38,477
Rachel, look in the glove,

1601
01:33:38,545 --> 01:33:41,480
hand me the insurance
and registration, would you?

1602
01:33:41,548 --> 01:33:43,682
I was only going 30.

1603
01:33:55,528 --> 01:33:57,330
Ma'am, would you please
step outside of the car?

1604
01:33:57,397 --> 01:33:59,866
What's going on?
- We just need you to step out.

1605
01:33:59,933 --> 01:34:02,501
Not you, ma'am.

1606
01:34:02,569 --> 01:34:04,470
Are you kidding me?
- Get out of the car, Rachel.

1607
01:34:04,538 --> 01:34:07,173
What's the problem, sir?
- I can't believe this.

1608
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:09,341
What do you want?
- I'm gonna ask you to
turn around, please.

1609
01:34:09,409 --> 01:34:13,646
What is it?
What are you doing?
- Hey, hey! Go easy on her.

1610
01:34:13,714 --> 01:34:15,581
Rachel, I'm sorry
that it's come to this.

1611
01:34:15,649 --> 01:34:17,483
What is going on?
- Back in the car, ma'am.

1612
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:19,018
Rachel, you're
being charged with...

1613
01:34:19,086 --> 01:34:20,787
BONNIE: What's going on here?
They're arresting me, Bonnie.

1614
01:34:20,854 --> 01:34:22,621
You're being charged
with criminal contempt
of court.

1615
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:24,390
What does that mean?

1616
01:34:24,457 --> 01:34:28,460
Well, it means you have
obstructed justice,
and you're going on trial.

1617
01:34:28,528 --> 01:34:31,898
Come on. Let's go.
- Hasn't she been
through enough?

1618
01:34:34,267 --> 01:34:36,268
God damn it.

1619
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,843
Oh, no. God.

1620
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:46,278
BONNIE: Dubois! Dubois!

1621
01:34:48,548 --> 01:34:51,417
PATTON: Rachel, you're
looking at a possible
five-year sentence

1622
01:34:51,484 --> 01:34:54,187
for impeding
a federal investigation,

1623
01:34:54,254 --> 01:34:56,823
but I don't wanna
go to trial.

1624
01:34:56,890 --> 01:34:59,859
So, I want to give you
a chance to plead
this sentence down.

1625
01:34:59,927 --> 01:35:05,431
I want you to look
in my eyes and gauge
my sincerity.

1626
01:35:05,498 --> 01:35:10,136
Use your reporter's instincts.
Okay? You're good with those.

1627
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:14,073
I'm gonna offer
you two years.
- No. No.

1628
01:35:14,141 --> 01:35:18,644
No, it's gonna be suspended
sentence, probation.

1629
01:35:18,712 --> 01:35:20,579
You have to respect
what she's been through.

1630
01:35:20,647 --> 01:35:24,817
Albert, two years is
not as good an offer
as it could be,

1631
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:27,620
but it's not as bad,
either.

1632
01:35:27,687 --> 01:35:31,457
Because you're guilty,
Miss Armstrong.
You're guilty as charged,

1633
01:35:31,524 --> 01:35:37,263
and if you want to waltz
into a courtroom
in a martyr's cloak,

1634
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:41,067
trust me, you're gonna
see something that
you have not seen yet.

1635
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:44,804
Because this polite,
country lawyer demeanor

1636
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:48,407
is gonna give way
to a wave of
self-righteous indignation

1637
01:35:48,475 --> 01:35:51,110
that you can't even
begin to imagine.

1638
01:35:51,178 --> 01:35:53,913
That jury is gonna hear
fire-breathing oratory

1639
01:35:53,981 --> 01:35:57,683
about a country
whose security has
been compromised,

1640
01:35:57,751 --> 01:36:02,255
a husband widowed,
and a little girl who's gotta
visit her mother's grave

1641
01:36:02,322 --> 01:36:05,524
because you wanted to
chase a Pulitzer Prize.

1642
01:36:08,428 --> 01:36:11,164
So, if you force me
to take you to trial,

1643
01:36:12,465 --> 01:36:14,133
I'm gonna make sure
that you don't make it home

1644
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:15,935
for your son's high
school graduation.

1645
01:36:16,003 --> 01:36:18,204
ALBERT:
Come on, that's enough.

1646
01:36:19,773 --> 01:36:22,275
So, what's
it gonna be, Rachel?

1647
01:36:27,647 --> 01:36:30,783
If I agree to this,
there is one thing I need.

1648
01:36:33,586 --> 01:36:34,921
Oh, my God. You have
gotten so handsome.

1649
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:38,390
You're a real little man.

1650
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:40,626
I'll bet you got
all the girls chasing
after you, huh?

1651
01:36:40,694 --> 01:36:42,461
No.

1652
01:36:42,529 --> 01:36:44,563
No? Well, you will.

1653
01:36:44,631 --> 01:36:47,533
I don't care. Whatever.

1654
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,303
Hey, I kind of like
your hair this way.

1655
01:36:52,873 --> 01:36:54,573
Look, I know
you're mad at me.

1656
01:36:54,641 --> 01:36:56,775
No, I'm not.

1657
01:36:56,844 --> 01:36:59,611
Well, I think you are,

1658
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:02,148
and I haven't let you
see me in a long time.

1659
01:37:02,216 --> 01:37:04,283
I'd be mad at me, too.
- Well, I'm not. Okay?

1660
01:37:04,351 --> 01:37:06,385
Okay.

1661
01:37:06,453 --> 01:37:08,888
Look, kiddo,
it hasn't been easy
for me, either.

1662
01:37:08,956 --> 01:37:10,389
If I'd known it was
gonna go on this long,

1663
01:37:10,457 --> 01:37:11,858
I would have done
things differently.

1664
01:37:11,925 --> 01:37:14,626
I would have let you see
me every single day.

1665
01:37:17,697 --> 01:37:19,365
I am so sorry.

1666
01:37:21,368 --> 01:37:23,569
Dad says you could have
got out of here many times.

1667
01:37:23,636 --> 01:37:25,604
Well, your dad is wrong.

1668
01:37:29,877 --> 01:37:32,378
Look, kiddo...
- I'm not a kid anymore.

1669
01:37:32,445 --> 01:37:35,181
Okay, you know what?
You can pretend not to
love me all you want,

1670
01:37:35,249 --> 01:37:37,750
and I can pretend
to believe it,

1671
01:37:39,552 --> 01:37:41,287
but I love you,

1672
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:45,124
and I think about you
every minute of every day.

1673
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:46,959
Okay?

1674
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:50,462
Dad says you're
going to prison.

1675
01:37:50,530 --> 01:37:53,665
I am.
- Isn't that where
you are now?

1676
01:37:53,733 --> 01:37:55,534
No. This is jail.

1677
01:37:55,602 --> 01:37:57,303
Jail is where you go
when they decide
your punishment,

1678
01:37:57,371 --> 01:38:00,006
and then you go to prison.

1679
01:38:00,073 --> 01:38:02,208
And what's
your punishment?

1680
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:04,410
Two years.

1681
01:38:04,477 --> 01:38:06,379
That's a long time.

1682
01:38:06,446 --> 01:38:10,016
Yeah. But if I'm
well-behaved, then
I might get out earlier.

1683
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:12,484
So...

1684
01:38:12,552 --> 01:38:15,154
Is it dangerous there?

1685
01:38:15,222 --> 01:38:19,292
You know what?
If you visit me,
come check on me,

1686
01:38:19,359 --> 01:38:21,360
I'll be okay.

1687
01:38:24,764 --> 01:38:28,134
Okay. I'm kind of busy,
but I'll try.

1688
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:33,306
I think we should go now,
on account of traffic and all.

1689
01:38:33,373 --> 01:38:36,809
Hey, hey, how about
a kiss? Just one.

1690
01:39:02,302 --> 01:39:03,369
TIMMY: Bye.

1691
01:39:59,192 --> 01:40:00,893
<i>TIMMY:</i>
<i>You're a tattletale!</i>

1692
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,362
<i>ALLISON: I am not!</i>
<i>You just told on Nicky.</i>

1693
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:05,697
<i>That's because</i>
<i>he won't stop.</i>

1694
01:40:05,765 --> 01:40:08,867
<i>You're a tattletale.</i>
<i>RACHEL: Timmy,</i>
<i>that's enough. Stop it.</i>

1695
01:40:08,935 --> 01:40:11,070
That's enough.
- But you're not
supposed to tattle.

1696
01:40:11,138 --> 01:40:14,773
Well, you're not supposed
to have to put up
with bullies, either.

1697
01:40:15,942 --> 01:40:17,743
Come on. Come on.

1698
01:40:19,812 --> 01:40:22,014
Are you a writer
or something?

1699
01:40:22,082 --> 01:40:25,651
Yeah, I'm a reporter.
I work for the
<i>Capital Sun Times.</i>

1700
01:40:25,718 --> 01:40:27,353
We get that newspaper.

1701
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:29,188
Oh, yeah? Well,
tell all your friends
to do the same.

1702
01:40:29,256 --> 01:40:33,559
The Internet is killing us.
- Mom, how long
till we get there?

1703
01:40:33,626 --> 01:40:35,561
About 18 hours, Timmy.

1704
01:40:35,628 --> 01:40:37,863
No, Mom, really.

1705
01:40:37,931 --> 01:40:40,132
I don't know.
I don't know.

1706
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:45,471
My daddy is a writer.

1707
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:48,441
He is? What does he write?
- He writes articles,

1708
01:40:48,508 --> 01:40:51,544
though my mom doesn't
really like what
he writes about.

1709
01:40:51,611 --> 01:40:54,947
What's he write about?
- He writes about
the President.

1710
01:40:55,949 --> 01:40:57,349
What's your last name?

1711
01:40:57,417 --> 01:40:58,917
Van Doren.

1712
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:02,821
Why doesn't your mommy
like what he writes about?

1713
01:41:02,889 --> 01:41:04,823
I heard her yelling
at Daddy once.

1714
01:41:04,891 --> 01:41:08,294
'Cause he used her
secret stuff,
she found out.

1715
01:41:08,361 --> 01:41:12,231
What she found out?
- When she was in Venezula.

1716
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:16,368
Why was your mom
in Venezuela?
Was she on vacation?

1717
01:41:16,436 --> 01:41:19,171
Uh-uh, she was working.

1718
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:23,409
Working?
- Uh-huh.
For the government.

1719
01:41:23,477 --> 01:41:27,012
But don't tell anybody
it's me who told you. Okay?

1720
01:41:29,916 --> 01:41:31,317
You bet.
