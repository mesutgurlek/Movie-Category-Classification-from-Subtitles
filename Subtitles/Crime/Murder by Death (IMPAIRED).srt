1
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,650
(eerie music playing)

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,930
(instrumental music playing)

3
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,120
(thunder rumbling)

4
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,440
Will they come?

5
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,150
They'll come.

6
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,380
Here. Stamp those
and mail them.

7
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,320
It's ringing.

8
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,990
Please walk myron
over there.

9
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,560
My leg looks like
a tree in this fog.

10
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,500
What a godforsaken
spot to get lost.

11
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,200
We passed
a better spot.

12
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,770
(telephone ringing)

13
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,450
Hello?

14
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,750
Hello?
Hello?

15
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,620
Tell them
we're lost.

16
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,990
(ringing continues)

17
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,860
Nobody answered,
the phone went dead.

18
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,730
Then why did you
say hello?

19
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,100
Funny, i could
have sworn...
What, dickie?

20
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
Sounded like somebody
snipped the wire.

21
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,070
Really?
What did it
sound like?

22
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,540
Snip.

23
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,210
Willie:
Some fog, eh, pop?

24
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,550
Wang: I've heard
the weather report.
Drive, please.

25
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,810
It's as thick
as pea soup.

26
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,980
Not a soul
around for miles.

27
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,220
Know what l think?
Perfect place for
a murder.

28
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,520
Conversation like
television set
on honeymoon.

29
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,960
Unnecessary.

30
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,810
(door creaking)

31
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,960
Willie: Where are
we going?

32
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,290
Who is mr. Twain?

33
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,130
What did he mean by
"dinner and a murder"?

34
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,530
Questions like
athlete's foot.

35
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,570
After while,
very irritating.

36
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,500
(dog barking)

37
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,600
To stop car,
please.

38
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,110
What's wrong?
Stop car, please.

39
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,970
(dog howling)

40
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,280
To shut engine
off, please.

41
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,080
Listen.

42
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,880
I don't hear nothing.
What do you hear?

43
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,410
Double negative
and dog.

44
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,220
So what?

45
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,320
If not mistaken,

46
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,220
Dog belong to
mr. Dick charleston.

47
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,320
Who is
dick charleston?

48
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,590
I am. Thank you.
Did you see
a little white...

49
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,020
Wang.
A white wang?

50
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,290
Good heavens.
Sidney wang.

51
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,260
What are you
doing here?

52
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,690
No doubt
same as you.

53
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:54,200
Looking for
bridge to home of
mr. Lionel twain.

54
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,700
You too, huh?

55
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,300
Must be important
to invite two such
eminent detectives.

56
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,540
Excuse, please.
To introduce
japanese son, willie.

57
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:02,970
Hi.

58
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,410
Japanese?
But i thought...

59
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,940
Mrs. Wang and i
never had children.

60
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,480
Willie adopted
number three son.

61
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,310
Be careful
on this road.
It's treacherous.

62
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,950
Treacherous road
like fresh mushroom...

63
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,310
Idiot.

64
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,920
Not finish
mushroom story.

65
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,020
You're idiot.

66
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,620
(scoffs)

67
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,990
I'm sorry,
<i>monsieur</i> perrier,
but i can see nothing.

68
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,660
This fog is thick
as bouillabaisse.

69
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,530
Nuts.

70
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,630
Pardon?
Nuts. Nuts.

71
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,770
No nuts
in my chocolate.

72
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,440
You got raisins.
I asked for nuts.

73
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,440
He didn't have
any nuts.

74
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,510
The man
in the shop?

75
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,610
That's why
i took raisins.

76
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,610
Never mind.

77
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,910
We will soon
be there for dinner.
Hot soup.

78
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,310
Still, <i> monsieur,</i>

79
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,250
Something is
not right here.

80
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,080
I can feel it
in my bones.

81
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,020
In your what?

82
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,950
In my bones.

83
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,490
Buns?
You have buns?

84
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,160
You bought buns
and didn't tell me?

85
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,460
Where are they?

86
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,630
No, <i> monsieur.</i>
The bones in my body.

87
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,660
Don't speak
with an accent
when i'm hungry.

88
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,580
Sam,
this is useless.

89
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,780
Nobody asked
you, baby.

90
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,980
Yes, they did.
You asked me
back there if...

91
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,280
That was then,
this is now,

92
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,620
And nobody knows
what tomorrow
will be.

93
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,820
That's the way
things are.

94
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,220
Sam, i really
worry about you
sometimes.

95
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,190
All right.
Cut the malarkey.

96
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,560
This trip is strictly
business with me.

97
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,490
What do you got
on this twain guy?

98
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
He was born
in san francisco
in 1906.

99
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,370
Mother was a roman catholic.
Father was an orthodox jew.

100
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,170
The marriage
lasted two hours.

101
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:01,870
Any children?

102
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,710
One daughter, 32,
irene, who calls
herself rita.

103
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,210
Just like a dame.

104
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,040
Don't stop.
You're doing fine.

105
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,250
Arrested in 1932 for
selling pornographic bibles.

106
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,180
Charges were dropped

107
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,550
When the church
refused to turn
over the bibles.

108
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,090
In '46,
he was picked up
in el paso, texas,

109
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,760
For smuggling a truckload
of rich white americans

110
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,290
Into mexico
to pick melons.

111
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,760
He was sent
to the dallas state hospital
for mental observation.

112
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,100
We've picked ourselves
a queer bird.

113
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,430
Anything else?

114
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,370
Oh, yeah.
Get this, sam.

115
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,040
Lionel twain has one
interesting physical
characteristic.

116
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,210
He has no pinkies.

117
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,210
No pinkies?

118
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,910
He only has
eight fingers?

119
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,850
No, 10.
He just doesn't
have any pinkies.

120
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,280
Good work,
angel.

121
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,420
Thanks, sam.
Where'd you
dig up that stuff?

122
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,420
I wrote to twain
and asked him.

123
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,420
Good thinking.

124
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,790
(engine sputtering)

125
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,190
What's the matter?

126
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,290
Wouldn't you know?
Out of gas.

127
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,730
I saw a station
about 5 miles back, sam.

128
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,000
I want you to know
i'll be waiting
for you.

129
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,510
Willie:
The bridge
doesn't look safe.

130
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,480
One way to find out.

131
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,550
Drive across.

132
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,950
Aren't you
coming with me?

133
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,550
Weight of two men
may be too much.

134
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,660
Why do i
have to drive?

135
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,290
(bridge creaking)
because i smart enough
to get out first.

136
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,340
(creaking continues)

137
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,810
It's going to
collapse, pop.

138
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,480
Not worry.
Father find other
way to house.

139
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,630
I made it, pop.
I made it.

140
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:31,330
Good. Now come
back and get
adopted father.

141
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,430
Look at invitation.

142
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,270
What number of house?

143
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,540
Two, two...

144
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,170
Correct.
22, twain's house.

145
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,940
Continue.

146
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,460
Did you see that?
No.

147
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,270
Neither did i.

148
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,810
Stop.
Do not move.

149
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,540
Something's
wrong here.

150
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,580
What is it, pop?
Do not ask
questions.

151
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,110
Do as i say.

152
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,610
When i tell you jump,
you jump.

153
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,450
Five,

154
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,280
Four, three, two...

155
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,550
Holy shanghai!

156
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,420
Nice counting, pop.
How did you know?

157
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,490
Look on ground.

158
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,730
Ha! Even had
correct shoe size.

159
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,360
Someone gone
great trouble

160
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,230
To make welcome guest
not so welcome.

161
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,370
Ring bell, please.

162
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,300
Are you nuts, pop?
Someone's trying
to kill us.

163
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,110
Yes. Should make
exciting weekend.

164
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,570
Ring, please.

165
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,610
I wish it was
monday morning.

166
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,950
Well, here goes.

167
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,980
(woman screaming)

168
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,320
Holy cow.
They're killing someone.

169
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,920
Calm yourself.
Didn't you
hear her scream?

170
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,020
No.
You heard scream.

171
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,820
More experienced ear
heard doorbell.

172
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,860
Listen again.

173
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,630
(woman screaming)

174
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:34,800
Mr. Twain has macabre
sense of humor, yes?

175
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,730
(thunder rumbling)

176
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,990
Good evening.
We have been
expecting you.

177
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,560
But in what condition?

178
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,590
Roof in need
of repair.

179
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,230
I'm afraid the house
is falling apart.

180
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,860
May we come in,
please?

181
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,900
I'm so sorry.
I thought you were in.

182
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,770
You are mr. And
mrs. Charleston?

183
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:18,970
Not quite.

184
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,710
I am inspector wang
of catalina police.

185
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,510
This adopted son,
willie.

186
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,780
I trust you had
a pleasant journey.

187
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,590
Strange weather.
Storm only outside,

188
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,430
Wind inside.

189
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,960
That's just
one of mr. Twain's
little toys,

190
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,600
An electronic device.

191
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,400
Mr. Twain, as you
will soon discover,

192
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,500
Prefers his
atmosphere murky.

193
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,370
May i have
your bags, sir?

194
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,070
No. Son
will get bags.

195
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,410
That is why
i adopted him.

196
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,380
Very good, sir.

197
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,140
One moment, please,

198
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,680
While i close the door.

199
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,980
Now,
i will show you
to your room.

200
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,160
Very large house.

201
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,060
No other servants?

202
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,530
I'm not sure.
I've never seen
anyone.

203
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,570
Mr. Twain asked me to
make you comfortable.

204
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,740
He will be joining
you after dinner.

205
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,680
After dinner?

206
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,380
Host not have dinner
with guests?

207
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,820
No. Mr. Twain
prefers to eat out.

208
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,190
(barking)

209
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,460
Wait, please.
What that?

210
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,830
It's nothing, sir.
Just the cat.

211
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,200
(barking continues)

212
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,670
That cat?

213
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,770
You feed cat
dog food?

214
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,140
He's a very angry cat.

215
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,640
Mr. Twain
had him fixed,

216
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,740
And he didn't
want to be.

217
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,310
(growls)

218
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,250
Big house,
huh, pop?

219
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,150
Big house
like man married
to fat woman.

220
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,480
Hard to
get around.

221
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,420
Here we are.

222
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,050
I'm sure you'll
find this suitable.

223
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,260
Boy, it's
a cold house.

224
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,360
I've taken care
of that, sir.

225
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,890
You'll find
a nice, cozy fire
in your room, sir.

226
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,450
It's a bit smoky, sir.

227
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,280
That fireplace hasn't
been used in years.

228
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,020
At least
the bed is warm.

229
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,550
If you wish
anything, sir,
please ring.

230
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,520
Where buzzer?

231
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,960
It's behind
the bed, sir. There.

232
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,090
Dinner will
be at 9:00,

233
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,490
And mr. Twain
likes his guests
to dress.

234
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,700
(woman screaming)

235
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,570
The doorbell.
Excuse me.

236
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,300
Wow. What a creepy guy.

237
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,470
Why would anyone
hire a blind butler?

238
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,910
For one thing,
very cheap.

239
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,580
How butler know
how much he get paid?

240
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,410
Drink this.
You'll feel better.

241
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,410
If myron
hadn't barked,

242
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,750
We wouldn't have
seen that statue falling.

243
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,520
It wasn't meant to kill.
It's a warning.

244
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,390
Somebody's just
trying to frighten us,
but why?

245
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,190
He's doing
a wonderful job.

246
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,520
Why hasn't
anybody answered?

247
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,930
Don't ring it
again, dickie.
Knock, don't ring.

248
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,830
I won't. I promise.

249
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,030
(thunder rumbling)

250
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,400
(growling)

251
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,530
What is it now,
myron?

252
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,200
Up there, dora.
Look.

253
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,840
A blind butler.

254
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,370
Don't let him
park the car,
dickie.

255
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,910
Good evening.
We have been
expecting you.

256
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,250
We let
ourselves in.

257
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,450
Dick and
dora charleston.

258
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,350
Good evening.
We have been
expecting you.

259
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,680
Your room is ready.

260
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,620
Just follow me, please.

261
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,090
(growls)

262
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,620
Never mind, ma'am.
It's just the cat.

263
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,560
Our luggage
is outside.

264
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,500
I'll get it
when i park the car.

265
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,970
Is mr. Wang here?
Yes.

266
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,900
They're resting
in their room.

267
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,810
I put you
in the same wing
as mr. Wang.

268
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,440
Isn't that nice?
We're in wang's wing.

269
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,190
Not many people come
to the manor these days.

270
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,650
It's nice to
hear guests again.

271
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,920
Thank you.
You are?
Bensonmum.

272
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,690
Thank you,
benson.

273
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,560
No. My name
is bensonmum.

274
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,530
Bensonmum?
Yes, sir.

275
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,560
Jamesir bensonmum.

276
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,030
Jamesir?

277
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,530
Yes, sir.
Jamesir
bensonmum?

278
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,170
Yes, sir.
How odd.

279
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,600
My father's
name, sir.
What?

280
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,540
Howard bensonmum.

281
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,340
Your father was
howard bensonmum?

282
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,710
Leave it be,
dickie.

283
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,640
Here is the late
mrs. Twain's room.

284
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,980
She died in here.

285
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,940
Oh, dear.

286
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,510
Died of what?

287
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,810
She murdered herself
in her sleep, sir.

288
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,750
You mean suicide?

289
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,280
No, it was murder
all right.

290
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:09,250
Mrs. Twain hated herself.

291
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,120
We keep this room locked.

292
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,960
Why is that?

293
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,360
Mr. Twain loved her
very much.

294
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,460
He's kept her room
just as it was

295
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,360
The night
she choked herself,

296
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,500
Nine years ago.

297
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,330
(door creaking)

298
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,940
Madam loved
it here.

299
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,980
She said
it was such
a cheerful room.

300
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,450
(mouse squeaking)

301
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,810
(screaming)

302
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,680
Ah, the doorbell.

303
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,350
That was
mrs. Charleston.

304
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,350
I thought
she was here.

305
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,020
I won't stay
in this filthy room.

306
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,720
Very well, madam.
I'll attend to it
during dinner.

307
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,430
Thank you,
bensonsir.
Mum.

308
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,030
What?
Bensonmum.

309
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,630
Ma'am.

310
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,400
Baking flour.
What?

311
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,270
This dust
is baking flour.

312
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,070
These cobwebs are
candied sugar.

313
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,280
All placed here
just to frighten us.

314
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,480
And that mouse is
obviously a mechanical toy.

315
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,920
(chuckles)

316
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,350
Silly.
What?

317
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,780
I am.

318
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,290
It's real.

319
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,250
(screams)

320
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,590
(mouse squeaking)

321
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,920
Perrier: Stop.
We are here.

322
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,560
That's why
i stopped the car.
Open my door.

323
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,260
There is chocolate
all over your face.
What?

324
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,200
The candy bar.
It is all over your face.

325
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,530
Fool. That's
my mustache.

326
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,800
Lick it and see.

327
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,900
Wipe it off.
My hands are sticky.

328
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,510
Hold still,
please.

329
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,680
Sloppy.

330
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,550
(woman screaming)

331
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,280
All in good time.

332
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,520
(knocking at door)

333
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,760
Yes.

334
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,590
Who's there?

335
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,330
Who's there,
i say?

336
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,200
Filthy neighborhood.

337
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,530
Didn't l say "jump"?

338
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,400
<i>Un, deux, trois,</i> jump.
Why don't you listen?

339
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,370
Oh, leave me alone.

340
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,640
Sloppy.

341
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,010
(thunder rumbling)

342
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,190
Who are you?

343
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,700
Oh. You must be
the new kitchen maid.

344
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,070
I hope you can cook.

345
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,500
Hmm?
Answer me.

346
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,570
Speak up.

347
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,710
What's that?
I can't hear you.

348
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,580
A little shy,
are you?

349
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,350
Never mind.

350
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,820
There will be 10
for dinner.

351
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,150
Here is the menu.

352
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:45,330
Is that
understood?

353
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,230
Dinner will
be at 9:00.

354
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,900
When i want you,

355
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,400
That bell will ring
three times.

356
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,040
All right.
Get to work.

357
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,480
Hello?

358
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,750
Hello, hello?
Operator?

359
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,220
I am saying
hello, hello.

360
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,220
It's dead, sir.

361
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,490
What? Who is?
Who are you?

362
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,790
The butler, sir.

363
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,120
The butler, eh?
I thought as much.

364
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,490
That phone has not
worked for a week, sir.

365
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,190
Is that a fact?

366
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,930
And i say
that this wire

367
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,500
Has been snipped,
not one hour ago.

368
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
As you can see.

369
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,570
What is your name?

370
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,470
Bensonmum.

371
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,940
Your little jest
escapes me.

372
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,110
I am
<i>monsieur</i> milo perrier.

373
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,240
My chauffeur was injured
by a falling gargoyle

374
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,540
While standing outside
in chinese footprints.

375
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,810
We rang the bell,
a woman screamed,

376
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,650
A mouse ran out
through the door.

377
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,520
As you can plainly see,

378
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,620
I miss nothing.

379
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,320
Since we cannot
call for a doctor,

380
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,550
I need a cold compress
for my chauffeur

381
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,990
And some hot chocolate
for me, <i> n'est-ce pas?</i>

382
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:01,790
We don't have nespa,
sir, just hershey's.

383
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,260
I'll call the maid.

384
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,030
(ringing)

385
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:12,470
(ringing continues)

386
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,970
I'll fetch it
for you myself, sir.

387
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,040
In the meantime,

388
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,740
I'll show you
your room.

389
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,280
Get up.
Get up.

390
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,080
I do not trust
this butler.

391
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,780
Notice how his eyes
never look at you.

392
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,280
He's blind, <i> monsieur.</i>

393
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,520
Nonsense.

394
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,160
Sam:
There's the house now.

395
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,760
(groans)

396
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,230
What's the matter?
My feet are
killing me.

397
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:54,200
Why didn't you
say we needed oil
before i got the gas?

398
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,830
Because i gave you
a $50 bill

399
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,470
And the gas was
only five bucks.

400
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,170
Maybe you'd come back,
maybe you wouldn't.

401
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,670
I couldn't take
that chance, angel.

402
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,800
Don't you trust me, sam?

403
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:04,300
Trust you?

404
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,570
The last time
i trusted a dame

405
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,810
Was in paris in 1940.

406
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,210
She went out
to get some wine.

407
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,150
Two hours later,
the germans marched
into france.

408
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,680
I'm sorry, sam.

409
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,050
Sorry, nothing.
Give me my change.

410
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,820
Dinner is
at 9:00, sir.

411
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,430
I'll have the maid
bring your chocolate.

412
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,930
One moment,
my good man.

413
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,330
Sir?

414
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,950
Thank you.
That will be all.

415
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,750
He's blind
all right.

416
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,750
Those were
my funniest faces.

417
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,960
Not exactly
the copacabana.

418
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,030
I don't feel good
about this.

419
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,200
Maybe tonight's
the night
your luck ends.

420
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,070
Maybe so.

421
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,270
There's a number
on the wall for
all of us, angel.

422
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:24,670
If tonight's the night
they pick mine,
so be it.

423
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,910
After you,
sweetheart.

424
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,940
First kiss me,
sam.

425
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,380
I don't kiss.

426
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,410
Just this once,
sam.

427
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:37,380
I don't like kissing.
Now leave me alone.

428
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,360
(woman screaming)

429
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,530
My god.
He's dead.

430
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,160
I beg your pardon.

431
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,000
Sam diamond is
lying out there,
crushed to death.

432
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,540
I'm going to faint.
You catch me.

433
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,140
Madam.

434
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,000
Madam,
where are you?

435
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,570
All right.
Hold it right there.
Freeze, blinky.

436
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,110
Get your hands up.
Face the wall.

437
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,680
Angel, you can
get up now.

438
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,150
Turn around,
jeeves.

439
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,320
Your concrete christmas
present arrived about
two seconds early,

440
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:27,960
No thanks to you.

441
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,190
I apologize for
any unfortunate
mishap, sir.

442
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,930
May i put
my hands down?

443
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,330
Don't test your luck,
shakespeare.

444
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,300
I got your little
invitation to dinner.

445
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,600
I didn't realize
i was the main course.

446
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:50,110
I had a kid brother
who got it the same way
two years ago.

447
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,380
That boy would have
been 63 on tuesday.

448
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,650
For two cents,
i'd take this...
Sam, no.

449
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,180
Get him away from me.

450
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,780
Get him away.

451
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,020
Get him away
before i stuff him

452
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,320
Like those tiger trophies

453
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,160
His limey pals hang up
on saloon walls.

454
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,760
Please.

455
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,390
He has a dreadful temper,
hasn't he?

456
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
(clock chiming)

457
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,710
9:00. Time
for dinner.

458
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,180
Is everything
ready? Hmm?

459
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,080
(sniffing)

460
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,050
I don't
smell anything.

461
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,320
Very light on
the seasoning,
are you?

462
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,620
Put the soup
in the tureen and
keep the squabs on low.

463
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,120
I'll serve cocktails.

464
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,320
When you hear
the bell,

465
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,190
Bring out
the chilled asparagus

466
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,760
And turn up
the flame
on the squabs.

467
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,030
Have you got that?

468
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,110
You didn't tell me
how l look, dickie.

469
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,950
No different than always,
absolutely ravishing.

470
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,320
Do you love
and adore me?

471
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,520
I love and adore you.

472
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,190
You still have
a great tush.

473
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,860
Years of
horseback riding,
darling.

474
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,930
Getting to
bottom of things?

475
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,100
Ah, wang.
Darling, you remember...
Of course.

476
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,400
Nice to see you,
ah wang.

477
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,730
Always a pleasure,
mrs. Charleston.

478
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,670
What a beautiful gown.

479
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,170
Where did you get it?

480
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,770
This an old dress.

481
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,010
Had it for years.

482
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,780
Please to meet
adopted son, willie.

483
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,140
Ah, east meets west

484
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,780
In a most
bizarre setting.

485
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,040
Perrier.
Charleston.

486
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,750
I didn't know
you were invited.

487
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,910
You know wang.
Ah, yes.

488
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:02,050
I dined in shanghai long ago
with inspector wang.

489
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,890
(speaking fake chinese)

490
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,190
Oh, you remember.
Yes.

491
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,690
You had
hong ching chu,

492
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:11,920
And i had
cow dung wu fong.

493
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,690
My wife dora,
inspector perrier.

494
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,830
(speaking french)

495
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,930
(coughing)

496
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:20,130
I'm sorry.
Our room is so dusty.

497
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,530
My fault.
I should have
blown first.

498
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,270
May i present my
<i>secretaire-chauffeur,</i>
marcel cassette?

499
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:30,270
Recovered from
your accident, marcel?

500
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,980
(responds in french)

501
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,510
How did you know?

502
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,840
From the way you bend.

503
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,510
Your right side
was smashed in

504
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,510
By a citroen,
i imagine.

505
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,680
I heard
a metallic sound,

506
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,480
So l think
you have an artificial hip.

507
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,220
Steel?
Aluminum.

508
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,750
You're still quick,
charleston.

509
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,460
And you,
mr. Charleston,
did not approve

510
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,830
Of mrs. Charleston
dyeing hair blonde?

511
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,930
I beg your pardon?

512
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,560
Mrs. Charleston
hair red.

513
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,000
You have blonde
hairs on shoulder.

514
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,370
That means she
has dyed red hair
to blonde

515
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,770
And back again
to red,

516
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,740
Or else
you have been...

517
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,540
Ah, so sorry.
Wang is, ah,
wrong.

518
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,010
Shall we go
eat now?

519
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,750
Boy, pop.
You sure put your...

520
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,090
Shut japanese mouth.

521
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,820
Must be ghastly
to have a hip removed.

522
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,790
Does your hip hurt?

523
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,520
Only in damp weather.

524
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,660
(thunder rumbling)

525
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,360
(screams in pain)

526
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,530
Are you all right?

527
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:46,330
Pay no attention.
You'll only
spoil him.

528
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,030
Get up.
Get up.

529
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,470
(metallic clinking)

530
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,540
As i was saying...

531
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,170
Hey, pop.

532
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,310
A treacherous road
like fresh mush...

533
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,740
Hey, pop.

534
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,410
I know.
Dog stick tongue
out of picture.

535
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,050
Treacherous road
like fresh mushroom...

536
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,950
He's a charming fellow.

537
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,620
African death mask.
Died in some tribal ritual.

538
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,120
Wonder where others are.

539
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,920
Others?

540
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,760
What others?

541
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,290
Invitation to
dinner and murder

542
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,930
Finally clear to wang

543
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,930
With appearance
of <i> monsieur</i> perrier.

544
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:33,530
Only the world's
greatest living detectives
were invited.

545
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,970
Five of us, darling.
Three already here.

546
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,600
Two have not
yet arrived.

547
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,570
Miss jessie marbles
of england, and mr...

548
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:44,640
Sam diamond
of san francisco.

549
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,040
I know
who you all are.

550
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,080
This lady here
in the rented dress is
my secretary and mistress,

551
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,550
Miss tess skeffington.

552
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,880
Oh, sam, don't...

553
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,120
Oh, i'm sorry,
sweetheart.

554
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,190
Miss skeffington
thinks i'm too
brutally honest.

555
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,420
But then,
we're in a brutal business.

556
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,290
Never consider murder
to be business,
mr. Diamond.

557
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,130
Is that right?

558
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,190
Maybe not for you,
mr. Wang,

559
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,600
Because you put your
money into vegetables
in the late '30s.

560
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,740
You own 50%
of the bean sprouts
and bamboo shoots

561
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,540
Grown on
the chinese mainland.

562
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,540
So you folks
can imagine

563
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,980
How much
chicken chow mein
mr. Wang has.

564
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,710
Am i right,
angel?
Right.

565
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,350
That doesn't
seem important.

566
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,950
Or you,
mr. Perrier.

567
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,220
You work both sides
of the big drink.

568
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,450
You solve crimes
for barons and earls

569
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,060
And put your fancy fees
into swiss banks.

570
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,990
That buys a lot
of hot chocolate.

571
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,230
Now see here,
diamond.

572
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,030
No, you see,
mr. Charleston
of new york,

573
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,170
Palm beach and
beverly hills.

574
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:57,530
Crime is
a hobby to you,

575
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,270
Just a game to pass
the time while waiting

576
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,210
For room service
in some fancy hotel.

577
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,940
Your wife's dough
buys you gin martinis
and $300 suits.

578
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:12,050
All you do is give your wife
a little grab now and then

579
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,780
And walk the dog.

580
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,750
Sorry if i'm
shocking you,

581
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,150
But i never went
to finishing school.

582
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,360
My school
is the streets,

583
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,960
And a pointed revolver
is my teacher.

584
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,200
I get $50 a day
and expenses.

585
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,430
I owe miss skeffington
three years' back pay.

586
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,930
Isn't that right,
angel?

587
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,270
I don't care,
sam.

588
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,100
Neither do i.

589
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,470
Would someone give
my lady friend

590
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,440
A glass of
cheap white wine?

591
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,070
I'm going
to find the can.

592
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,040
I talk so much sometimes,
i forget to go.

593
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,810
Please excuse sam.

594
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,720
He was shot in the head
last week.

595
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,150
He shouldn't be
out of the hospital.

596
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,620
I think the fellow is
damned honest.

597
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,790
Dora:
Dickie, language.

598
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:04,020
Miss jessica marbles
and nurse.

599
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,730
Ah, miss marbles.

600
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,600
So we
finally meet.

601
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,810
Have admire you
since i was tiny
little detective.

602
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,010
Thank you,
mr. Wang.

603
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,240
I am jessica marbles.

604
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,750
This is
miss withers,
my nurse.

605
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,780
She's been
with me 52 years.

606
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,920
I must take
care of her now.

607
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,620
Are you all right,
miss withers?

608
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,950
Do you want
your medicine?

609
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,250
No.

610
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,060
Ow!

611
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:48,930
She's off.

612
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,700
I could use
a stiff shot,
mr. Charleston.

613
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,700
I believe booze,
as you call it,
is your department.

614
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,340
My pleasure,
madam.

615
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,040
Who's
the old geezer?

616
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,640
Sam!

617
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,340
Jessie, baby.

618
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,540
Sam diamond!

619
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,880
There's
a bullet hole
in your back.

620
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,040
You should see
the other guy.

621
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,010
(man groaning)

622
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,510
Quiet, please.

623
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,450
Observe strange sound.

624
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,590
(groaning continues)

625
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,220
My god,
it's the face.

626
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,360
It's coming
from the face.

627
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,320
(groaning)

628
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,290
He's going through
his dying moments.

629
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,330
What could
it mean?

630
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:35,160
Dinner, sir.
We have no gong.

631
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,570
Ladies and gentlemen,
i propose a toast.

632
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:51,110
Our host,
mr. Lionel twain,
is a unique man.

633
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:55,850
Point one,
he has gathered the
world's greatest detectives

634
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:59,350
To investigate a crime
that has not yet
been committed.

635
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,350
Point two,
he has set traps for us,

636
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,020
A bridge
that almost collapses,
falling statues.

637
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,890
Does he mean
to kill us?

638
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,960
Not yet.
He could've done
that at any time.

639
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,430
He's merely
whetting our appetites

640
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,030
For the rest of the game.

641
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:18,330
Point three,
why five detectives
instead of one?

642
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,370
Because he intends
to challenge us all,

643
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:25,340
A feat no criminal mind
has heretofore attempted.

644
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,780
Therefore, before this
hellish weekend begins,

645
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,080
I propose
that we toast

646
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,850
Either a most beguiling
and charming man,

647
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:38,950
Or an insidious,
fiendish madman.

648
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,590
Bottoms up.

649
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,520
One moment,
please.

650
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,790
Point four,
wine poisoned.

651
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,260
(all muttering)

652
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,760
An ancient,
tasteless, colorless

653
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,300
And odorless oriental herb

654
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,160
That kills instantly.

655
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,230
Observe, please.

656
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:02,040
(all gasping)

657
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:07,540
Great scott.
Mr. Wang, you've
saved our lives.

658
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,680
Not quite,
mrs. Charleston.

659
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,810
Bon appetit.

660
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,180
(all screaming)

661
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:19,250
Only <i> monsieur</i> wang
could detect
the poison,

662
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,950
So only
he was tested.

663
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,990
Point five,
mr. Twain is both

664
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,990
Beguiling and fiendish.

665
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,590
(groans)

666
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,320
Oh!

667
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,290
Oh, get a doctor,
quick.

668
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,860
No,
it's all right.

669
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,660
My wine is
not poisoned.

670
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,460
It was just
a bad year.

671
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,030
Good work, mr. Wang.

672
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,560
We must all
be on our guard

673
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,270
Through every course
of the meal.

674
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:47,640
You're all
forgetting one thing.

675
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,110
This makes the butler
suspicious.

676
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,970
He poured the wine.

677
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,380
Except he is blind.

678
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,610
How would he know
which one to serve
the poisoned glass to?

679
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,950
That's very simple.

680
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:01,980
Blind people have
a very keen sense
of smell.

681
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,920
Since we're
anglo-saxon

682
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,090
And mr. Wang's son
is japanese,

683
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,190
It wouldn't be hard
to sniff out the chinaman.

684
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,260
Charleston: See here.
That's a tacky thing
to say.

685
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,230
It's a tacky world,
mr. Charleston.

686
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,490
Isn't that right,
angel?

687
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,530
That's right, sam.

688
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:20,060
Quiet, please.
Butler approaches.

689
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,330
I apologize
for the delay.

690
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:25,730
I'm having
communication problems
with the cook.

691
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,530
Who poured the wine?

692
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:32,610
Mr. Twain, sir.
He left it in
the refrigerator.

693
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:34,340
I was told
to give mr. Wang

694
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,010
The glass with
the sticky stem.

695
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,280
And you didn't
ask why?

696
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,310
I was lucky to find
the refrigerator, sir.

697
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:43,450
I will serve
the soup now.

698
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,850
Perrier:
By all means.

699
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,490
(inaudible)

700
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,220
(inaudible)

701
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,330
Yes,
i'm starving.

702
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,410
One moment.
Where is the soup?

703
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,410
In your dish, sir.

704
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:21,410
There is nothing
in my dish
but my dish.

705
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,250
I don't understand,
sir.

706
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:27,190
Take the spoon.
Taste it yourself.

707
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,930
I see what
you mean, sir.

708
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,060
If you'll
excuse me,

709
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:42,070
I need to talk
with the cook.

710
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,840
Murder by starvation.

711
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,340
Maybe that's his game.

712
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:49,940
What do you think, sam?

713
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:55,240
Ask the moose.
He's been
watching us.

714
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,910
(all murmuring)

715
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,150
Ten people for dinner,

716
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:03,120
And i'm serving
hot nothing.

717
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,250
You can't get
good help today.

718
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:15,260
You're fired.
Do you understand?
Fired.

719
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:18,800
I want you out.
Do you hear?

720
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,300
And stay out.

721
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,000
Something just
occurred to me.

722
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,170
The seating's all wrong.

723
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,670
How so,
mr. Charleston?

724
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,610
I'm sitting
next to dora.

725
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,270
What's wrong with that?

726
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,510
She's your wife,
isn't she?

727
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:40,580
At a dinner party,
a husband and wife
shouldn't sit together.

728
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,750
I should be
on the opposite side
of the table.

729
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,280
Mr. Wang,
please change places
with me.

730
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,520
Now?

731
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,980
Now.

732
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:49,880
(all screaming)

733
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:53,390
Just as i thought.
Another test that
almost killed us.

734
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,790
Saved only because
i am enormously well-bred.

735
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:00,760
Lucky it wasn't me.
I'd be chopped
liver now.

736
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,330
(all clamoring)

737
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:07,670
Wang:
Silence, please.
Do not panic.

738
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,070
No person move
from place.

739
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:12,740
Charleston:
Someone just
came in.

740
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,170
Quiet, everyone.
I smell something.

741
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,740
Miss marbles:
What is it?

742
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,680
Good god.
Franks and beans.

743
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,280
I'm afraid that's
all we have, sir.

744
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,780
Dora:
Dickie, don't
touch me there.

745
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:28,820
Charleston:
My hands are
in my pockets.

746
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,420
Sam:
They're my pockets.

747
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,350
Charleston:
Sorry about that.

748
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:34,150
Dora:
Dickie, behave yourself.

749
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,660
Twain:
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

750
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,630
I'm your host,
lionel twain.

751
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,610
Good god.
What an entrance.

752
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:01,610
A bit theatrical,
miss marbles,

753
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,550
But i do
love illusion.

754
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,550
Please forgive my hat.
I'm losing my hair.

755
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:10,050
I thought
twain was older.
72, 73.

756
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:14,360
Seventy-six to be exact,
mr. Diamond.

757
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,990
How do i
look so young?

758
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:19,560
Quite simple.
A complete vegetable diet,

759
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,660
Twelve hours sleep
a night

760
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,160
And lots and lots of make-up.

761
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:27,500
I trust you've all been
made comfortable.

762
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,670
Comfortable,
mr. Twain?

763
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:33,100
Do you call poison,
a near decapitation,
comfortable?

764
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:36,510
No, i call it
inspiration.

765
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,470
You still
must explain

766
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,310
The attempts
on our lives,
<i>monsieur</i> twain.

767
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:44,150
Merely games,
<i>monsieur</i> perrier.

768
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:47,080
Pitting wits with you,
so to speak.

769
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:51,920
Pit your wits with me
and you won't have wits
to pit with.

770
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,660
You're spitting
on the nurse.

771
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,160
Sorry, old lady.

772
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,660
Crazy broad
should be in bed.

773
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,330
<i>Monsieur</i> twain,
after four hours,
we haven't seen

774
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:04,070
A hot dinner
or a cold corpse.

775
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,530
I therefore
bid you adieu.

776
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,140
I bid one adieu,
also.

777
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,170
No one is
leaving this house.

778
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,980
What meaning of this,
mr. Twain?

779
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,120
I will tell you, mr. Wang,
if you can tell me

780
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,420
Why a man with
such a brilliant mind

781
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,990
Can't say his
prepositions or articles.

782
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:38,130
"the," mr. Wang.
What is "the" meaning of this?

783
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,400
That what i said.

784
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,560
What meaning of this?

785
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,100
The meaning of this is

786
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,670
I have decided to
prove beyond a doubt

787
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:50,370
That the greatest
living criminologist
in the world

788
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,270
Is sitting
at this table,

789
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:55,310
And you are all
looking at him.

790
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,580
No, don't look
at each other.

791
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,110
Look at me!
I'm the greatest.

792
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,350
I'm number one.

793
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:03,710
You look like
number two.

794
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,550
Know what i mean?

795
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,280
What does he mean?

796
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,290
Tell you later.
It's disgusting.

797
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:13,160
In all your
various adventures,

798
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:16,430
Not one of you has ever
had an unsolved murder.

799
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:20,930
Your reputations exist
on this single fact.

800
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:23,930
But what would
the world say

801
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:26,830
If the five greatest
living detectives

802
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,770
Found themselves trapped
in a country house,

803
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:32,470
Shut off from the world,

804
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,970
Only to discover
a body on the floor,

805
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,810
Stabbed 12 times
in the back with
a butcher's knife,

806
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:45,350
And not one able
to solve the crime?

807
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:46,280
You mean murder?

808
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,590
Dora, please.
We're talking shop.

809
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:50,390
Yes! Murder,
mrs. Charleston.

810
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:51,990
Exactly at midnight,

811
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:55,620
Someone in this
house will be
viciously murdered.

812
00:47:55,630 --> 00:48:00,200
Left out one small
detail, mr. Twain.

813
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,760
Who victim?

814
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,800
"is the!" "is the!"

815
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,600
Who "is the" victim?

816
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,270
That drives me crazy!

817
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:12,340
Sounds like
a short ride to me.

818
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,240
Well, we shall see
who is sane

819
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,510
And who is crazy
around here.

820
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:24,810
Mr. Wang, the victim
is at this very table
at this very moment,

821
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:28,180
And so, too,
ladies and gentlemen,

822
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,520
Is the murderer.

823
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,580
Murder-poo?

824
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:36,220
Yes, dear.
We're going to have
a lovely murder-poo.

825
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:36,850
(giggles)

826
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:41,020
Why don't you
push her wheelchair
down the driveway?

827
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:43,460
You know who's
gonna get it?

828
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:43,990
Intimately.

829
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,490
And you know
the method?
Definitely.

830
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,960
And exactly what time
murder to take place?

831
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,300
"the" murder.

832
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,030
Precisely.

833
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,270
Well, i know
it's none of my business,

834
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:57,200
But doesn't that mean
that you're the murderer,
mr. Twain?

835
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:57,840
No wives.

836
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,700
I refuse to discuss
this with wives.

837
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,610
Dora is quite right.
All fingers do seem
to point to you.

838
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,210
It's not much
of a challenge.

839
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:07,110
Shall i make it
more interesting,
mr. Charleston?

840
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,780
$1 million to the one
who solves the crime.

841
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:13,810
Wagered against
your reputations.

842
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,850
$1 million in
tax-free cash.

843
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:20,220
Also, the paperback rights
and the film sale.

844
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,590
It's 11:00, <i> amigos.</i>

845
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:26,260
One hour
before death strikes
someone in this room.

846
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,990
See you at midnight.

847
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,900
Toodle-oo!

848
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,930
See here,
<i>monsieur</i> twain!

849
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,300
He's gone!

850
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,870
No, he's not.
He's down there.

851
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:39,500
(all gasp)

852
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,000
Fast little
bunny rabbit,
ain't you?

853
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:44,540
I've never moved,
mr. Diamond.

854
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:45,840
I'm still down there.

855
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,110
A stunt done
with mirrors.

856
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,440
Is that so?

857
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,180
Willing to risk
seven years bad luck?

858
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,650
Try it, mr. Diamond.

859
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:56,550
It's your funeral,
butterball.

860
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:58,780
(all gasp)
wait!

861
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:01,750
Sometimes it
doesn't work.

862
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,890
You've won this round,
mr. Diamond.

863
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,730
My turn comes
at midnight.

864
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:20,270
I hope he can
stop that thing.

865
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:23,040
If you ask me,
anybody offering
a million bucks

866
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,880
For a crime
that's not committed,

867
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,910
That's nuts.

868
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:31,210
Should we wait
until someone's
butchered?

869
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,710
What's happened
to the butler?

870
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,120
Why hasn't he returned
with our dinner?

871
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,650
Go look for him.

872
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,120
No one leave.

873
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:41,960
Why not, pop?

874
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,860
Twain say victim
at this table.

875
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,190
If we stay together,

876
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,130
Crime cannot be committed
without witnesses.

877
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,160
You're one smart
chinaman, mr. Wang.

878
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:56,900
Joining hands
will make the
chain stronger.

879
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,170
Join hands, please.

880
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,470
(ticking)

881
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:12,580
Stop that.

882
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,550
Stop it, i said.

883
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,020
What is it,
diamond?

884
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,090
She's giving
my palm the finger,
the dirty broad.

885
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,520
Naughty, naughty,
miss withers.

886
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,260
(giggling)

887
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,390
(inaudible)

888
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,200
Good god! Look!

889
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,030
(inaudible)

890
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,870
Tess: What is she doing?

891
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:41,140
Screaming.
What is it?

892
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:41,740
What's happened?

893
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:44,300
Something wrong
in kitchen.
With our dinner!

894
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,370
No, no.
Patience, patience.

895
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:48,640
Is someone in there?
Is someone in the
kitchen with dinner?

896
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,340
Cook cannot
speak or hear.

897
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,250
"i think
butler is dead.

898
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:59,750
"my name is yetta.
I don't work thursdays."

899
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,250
Ask if she sleeps in.

900
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,550
We must
investigate this.

901
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:04,150
Someone has to go.
Not alone.

902
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:06,550
Mr. Charleston,
mr. Diamond stay.

903
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,820
Miss marbles,
<i>monsieur</i> perrier

904
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,930
And wang will
investigate.

905
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,400
Oh, that's right.

906
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,900
Let it all out.

907
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,800
(inaudible)

908
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:25,600
Careful, wang!

909
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,370
Fingerprints.

910
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:29,570
Where?
Yours.

911
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:32,710
Here, take
my handkerchief.

912
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,060
Is he...
Looks...

913
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,020
Seems like...

914
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:52,190
(both gasp)
don't touch him!

915
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,530
Fingerprints.

916
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:55,290
Quite so.

917
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,160
Pencil.

918
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,940
Wang: No pulse,

919
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,680
No heartbeat.

920
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:22,050
If condition
does not change,
this man is dead.

921
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:23,680
No signs of foul play.

922
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:27,090
Hold on!
What's this?

923
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:31,890
What do you
make of this, perrier?

924
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:34,030
Poison,
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

925
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:36,260
Not nespa, cocoa.

926
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,560
At last,
we have our murder.

927
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:40,330
Not quite.

928
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:43,600
Twain say murder victim
sitting at our table.

929
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,430
Butler not at our table.

930
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,400
Butler only killed
to divert us

931
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,610
From real murder
still to come.

932
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:51,810
(both gasp)

933
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:53,170
(screams)
look!

934
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,040
A knife is missing!

935
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,180
The butcher's knife,
i'll wager.

936
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,550
The others
are in danger.

937
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,310
What is exact time,
please?

938
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,880
11:31 and 56 seconds.

939
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,150
57, 58...

940
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:08,920
Tell me
when to stop.

941
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:09,690
59, 60.

942
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:12,560
Twenty-eight minutes
to main murder.

943
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,860
Back to dining room.

944
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,860
Must be together
at midnight.

945
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:20,160
One moment!

946
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,100
(gasps)

947
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:26,830
Wang: Handkerchief.

948
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,250
What is it?

949
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,150
A bill.

950
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,910
Everything's rented
for tonight.

951
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,580
The butler, cook,
food and chairs.

952
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,080
You mean...

953
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:51,420
This entire murder
has been catered.

954
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:57,060
It's twain's doing.
He's crazy.

955
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,430
Ah, yes, but no fool.

956
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:00,900
I hope we're in time.

957
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:01,630
Door locked.

958
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:04,670
Sam diamond
probably locked it.

959
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:07,430
Good thinking
on diamond head.

960
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,270
Diamond,
it's perrier.

961
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,840
It's all right.
Open up.

962
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,910
Diamond, charleston.
Are you in there?

963
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:19,440
Get key from pocket
of dead butler.

964
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:24,880
Don't say "dead."
i have to reach
into his pocket.

965
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,920
(exclaims)

966
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,060
Holy <i> merde!</i>

967
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:47,170
Miss skeffington!

968
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:50,470
Miss marbles:
Miss skeffington!
Miss withers!

969
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:50,940
He is gone.

970
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,010
Who's gone?
The butler.
His body is missing.

971
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:54,970
Here's the key.

972
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,510
Where you find key?

973
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:58,140
In his pocket.
What pocket?

974
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,240
The butler's pocket.

975
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,380
Butler gone,
but pocket there?

976
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:01,910
Exactly.

977
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:04,550
Somebody stole his body,
but left his clothes.

978
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:06,150
Quickly!
Open the door.

979
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:09,120
Something is
wrong here.

980
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,690
Hello!
Where is everyone?

981
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:20,030
Room filled
with empty people.

982
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:22,590
I'll try
the other door.

983
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:26,130
It's locked
from the inside.

984
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:26,600
Strange.

985
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,900
Both doors locked
from inside,
yet no way out.

986
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:31,170
I don't like it.
I don't like it one bit!

987
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:34,570
I like, but
don't understand.

988
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:35,940
Maybe other way
out of room.

989
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,310
Secret passageway,
perhaps.

990
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:44,010
Twain: There are no secret
passageways, mr. Wang.

991
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:45,850
You spoke?
No.

992
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:47,110
Not me.

993
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,680
I spoke.

994
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,020
Ah! There!

995
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:53,120
Voice come from cow
on wall.

996
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,450
Moose! Moose,
you imbecile!

997
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,050
Where are they?

998
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:59,820
What have you done
with the others,
you short madman?

999
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:01,990
Ah-ha! Stumped already!

1000
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,890
Need some clues,
<i>monsieur</i> perrier?

1001
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,060
Clues!
I need no clues.

1002
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,960
I find my own clues,
you demented lollipop!

1003
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,600
Calm yourself.
Man who argue
with cow on wall

1004
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,430
Is like train
without wheels.
Get nowhere.

1005
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,530
Okay, quiet.
I'm sick of your
fortune cookies.

1006
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,140
Man who sick of
fortune cookies...

1007
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,910
I'm sick of
fortune cookies...

1008
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,070
(shushing)

1009
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:23,310
Cow talk again.

1010
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:26,010
Need a hint,
miss marbles?

1011
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,180
You mistake
what you assume.

1012
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,850
They never left
the dining room.

1013
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:33,250
Count the numbers
1 to 10,

1014
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,580
Turn the knob
and try again.

1015
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:36,750
(laughing)

1016
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,650
What the devil
does that mean?

1017
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,420
"they never left
the dining room."

1018
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,150
Certainly they did.

1019
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:42,950
Do not mistake
what you assume,
miss marbles.

1020
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,960
Quick, back
out in hall.
Why?

1021
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,660
We assume
others not here.

1022
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:50,160
Cow say they in room.

1023
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,730
Let's look once more.

1024
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,070
Please close door,
<i>monsieur</i> perrier.

1025
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,700
I cannot see
what possible...

1026
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:04,410
Quiet.
7, 8, 9, 10.

1027
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:08,340
Miss marbles,
open door, please.

1028
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,350
Where were you, wang?
We was worried.

1029
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:18,520
Where were you?

1030
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,350
We were here.
You said don't leave.

1031
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,860
You haven't
left this room?

1032
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,490
All: No.

1033
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,390
Answer simple,

1034
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:30,060
But question hard.

1035
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:30,930
Where's the butler?

1036
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:33,830
Butler completely
murdered.

1037
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:34,500
Poisoned.

1038
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,760
A butcher knife
is missing.

1039
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:40,070
We came to tell you,
but the doors were locked.

1040
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:42,870
I wanted
the butler's key,

1041
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,770
But his body
was missing.

1042
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,170
He had been
stripped naked.

1043
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:48,340
His clothes
were left.

1044
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,010
I don't understand.

1045
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:52,610
Why would anyone steal
a dead, naked body?

1046
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,810
Well, dear,
there are people...

1047
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:59,010
That's tacky.

1048
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:00,510
That's really tacky.

1049
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,650
Then we returned here,
opened the door,

1050
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:06,120
But the room was empty.

1051
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,920
You were all gone.

1052
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,920
(chuckles)

1053
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,490
The moose head told us
not to assume

1054
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,630
That you'd left
the dining room.

1055
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:18,330
So we counted to 10
and tried it again.

1056
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:21,170
And here you were.

1057
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:24,370
I'm not one to
use hyperbole,

1058
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:25,870
But i'll tell you this,

1059
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:27,070
For the first time
in my life,

1060
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:30,370
I had the ca-ca
scared out of me.

1061
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:34,880
I like her.
I really like her.

1062
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:35,810
(gunshots)

1063
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,750
Gunshots, <i> monsieur.</i>
Gunshots, pop.

1064
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:40,150
Gunshots, sam.
Gunshots, dickie.

1065
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,620
Shoes!

1066
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,220
This time,
charleston
and i will go.

1067
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,190
Everybody else
stay here.

1068
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,750
Let's go,
charleston.

1069
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:56,130
What do you make
of all this, wang?

1070
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,000
Is confusing.

1071
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,840
"it!" "it" is confusing.
Say your pronouns!

1072
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,540
(scoffs)

1073
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,880
Open the door.

1074
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,710
Good god!
What is it?

1075
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:18,410
He's back.

1076
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,350
And au naturel.

1077
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,650
I don't get it.

1078
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:28,220
First they steal
the body and leave
the clothes.

1079
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:33,390
Who would steal
the clothes and bring
the body back?

1080
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:35,930
Possibly some
deranged dry cleaner.

1081
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,590
What about the gunshots?

1082
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,060
Why shoot someone
who'd been poisoned?

1083
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:43,230
True. We heard gunshots,
but i don't see
any bullet holes.

1084
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:46,230
Not in his head, his neck,
his back or his chest.

1085
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,170
Look all over him.

1086
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:49,670
All over his body?

1087
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:51,510
Somebody has to do it.

1088
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:53,810
I'll stand guard.
You look.

1089
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,480
All right.
We'll take turns.

1090
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,910
Search the first
naked body.

1091
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:01,380
I'll search the
second one we find.

1092
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,580
(thunder rumbling)

1093
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:06,020
Hurry up.
We only got eight minutes.

1094
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,960
(groans)

1095
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,720
You see anything?

1096
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:17,430
I don't see
a bullet hole.

1097
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:20,030
Hold it,
i see something.

1098
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:21,060
What is it?

1099
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:23,400
Forget it. My mistake.
Not a bullet hole.

1100
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,830
Then what about
the shots?

1101
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:28,470
Divide and conquer.

1102
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:30,030
What?
Another diversion.

1103
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:31,840
He gives us
meaningless clues

1104
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:36,440
And dangles red herrings
before our eyes

1105
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,110
As precious seconds
tick away.

1106
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:40,610
Another murder
is still to come.

1107
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:44,850
You're not
my type of cop,
but you smell good.

1108
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:48,350
If you're not a pansy,
what are you?

1109
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:49,950
Classy, i suppose.

1110
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:51,820
Dames love
guys like you.

1111
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:52,890
I don't see
what possibly...

1112
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:55,950
You ever make it
with a waitress?
What?

1113
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,750
A waitress.

1114
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,690
A big fat waitress.

1115
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:00,320
I don't know
about society dames,

1116
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:05,390
But you ain't had it
until you've made it
with a fat waitress.

1117
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,100
If you're interested,
give me a call.

1118
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,300
Bizarre little twit.

1119
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,970
I'm not sure about him.

1120
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:27,110
What are you doing?

1121
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,680
My hands
need washing.
Good.

1122
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,950
I'll be right out.

1123
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:33,020
I'll tell them.

1124
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:37,890
You're never going
to believe this.

1125
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:40,320
All right,
where are you?

1126
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,760
What the hell
is going on?

1127
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,960
Charleston, wash up later.
We've got problems.

1128
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:54,530
Locked from the inside.

1129
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,170
That can only
mean one thing,

1130
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:02,040
And i don't know
what it is.

1131
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,010
Charleston!

1132
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:10,310
You'll never believe...

1133
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:12,350
(growling)

1134
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:22,220
I'll be right out!

1135
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,930
I don't remember
closing that door.

1136
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,940
What happened?

1137
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,910
What were
the gunshots?

1138
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,850
Did anybody leave?

1139
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:52,080
It happened
to you, too?

1140
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,380
Where's my dickie?

1141
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:55,680
Sorry.
Where's my husband?

1142
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:00,120
Two minutes to midnight,
if anyone's interested.

1143
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,690
It ain't possible.

1144
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:03,860
Eight people
in a dining room

1145
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:06,190
Can't suddenly
disappear.

1146
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:07,760
Unless...

1147
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,330
What?

1148
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:09,860
Unless it
never happened.

1149
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,690
I see your point,
diamond.

1150
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,460
When is a full
dining room not full?

1151
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:17,830
When there's
two dining rooms.

1152
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,000
Exactly!

1153
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,130
Two dining rooms?

1154
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:22,300
Two dining rooms,
two of everything.

1155
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,700
Twain electronic genius.

1156
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:28,570
He has devised a way
to move this room
quickly and silently,

1157
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:29,610
In the flash of an eye,

1158
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:33,180
To be replaced by
an identical room.

1159
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,050
I knew it!

1160
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:36,050
Please.
I shall demonstrate.

1161
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:41,990
I'll walk out the door,
return, and you will
all be gone.

1162
01:04:41,990 --> 01:04:43,390
Observe.

1163
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,030
I've figured it out.

1164
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:53,000
There are two
of everything.

1165
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,430
Oh, dickie,
that's old news.

1166
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:57,830
Everybody take
your seats.

1167
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:59,670
I'm scared, sam.
Hold me.

1168
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:02,170
Hold yourself.
I'm busy.

1169
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:03,470
Sit in your same seat.

1170
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:07,910
40 seconds!
I'm worried about
<i>monsieur</i> perrier.

1171
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:09,340
I'll look for him.

1172
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:11,840
No one to leave room.

1173
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:13,410
(knocking at door)

1174
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,050
No, it's the other door.

1175
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,920
It's locked.
I can't open it.

1176
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,450
Hurry!
We have 15 seconds.

1177
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:25,890
Move your hand,
chauffeur.

1178
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:31,520
Don't ask me!

1179
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:33,130
Why the butler's
uniform?

1180
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:35,760
I said don't ask me!
I don't know.

1181
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,000
It all happened
too quickly.

1182
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,930
The cook.
Where's the cook?

1183
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,340
Gone!
Never said a word.

1184
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:49,210
Ten more seconds.
Sit and join hands.

1185
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:56,080
Impossible for murder
to happen now without
witnesses.

1186
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:59,780
Three, two, one!

1187
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:02,250
(clock chiming)

1188
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:18,800
(chiming continues)

1189
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:28,440
(nervous laughter)

1190
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,780
(sighing in relief)

1191
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:33,650
It's over.
We're safe and sound.

1192
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:37,420
(knocking at door)

1193
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,220
That's probably
the cook. Come in.

1194
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:41,220
The woman is deaf.

1195
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:45,160
I'm sorry, i forgot.
Come in!

1196
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,390
Not sound like
cook to me.

1197
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:05,480
Ah, mr. Twain!

1198
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:08,180
You appear
to be wrong.

1199
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:12,580
Nobody here murdered.
Please come in.

1200
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,820
(all screaming)

1201
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,650
Is he dead?

1202
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:22,220
If he's not,
he should be.

1203
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:24,420
Touch nothing!
Stop saying "touch nothing."

1204
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:26,860
We're experienced
criminologists.

1205
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:30,930
It's insulting to
say "touch nothing."

1206
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:34,200
Be quiet, woman!
Up yours, fellow!

1207
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:34,770
Most amusing.

1208
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:38,670
Bickering detectives
like making giant lamb stew.

1209
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:40,070
Everything go to pot.

1210
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:42,400
Why don't you
be quiet?

1211
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:44,070
(all bickering)

1212
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:45,670
(gun fires)

1213
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,440
Quiet!

1214
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,780
Stay where you are,
everybody.

1215
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:51,340
What?
I'm going to the can.

1216
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:54,280
I don't want
to miss nothing.

1217
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,280
I'm going, too.

1218
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:00,120
I'd rather
do this alone.

1219
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,050
Thanks anyway.

1220
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:06,960
Dora: The cook.

1221
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:08,690
What, darling?

1222
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,830
The cook murdered him.

1223
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:14,530
The butler's dead.
She wasn't in this room.

1224
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:17,500
No one else
could get out.

1225
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,770
Right?

1226
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:20,270
Wrong.
Oh?

1227
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,130
What makes you certain?

1228
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:29,010
This arm isn't strong
enough to force a knife
that far up a man's back.

1229
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:30,010
(all scream)

1230
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,110
Is that the cook's arm?

1231
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:33,380
It ain't
the pussycat's tail.

1232
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:33,910
Oh!

1233
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:37,350
Don't be alarmed.
It ain't real.

1234
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:39,780
Neither is the cook.

1235
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:44,820
I found this before
i got to the can.

1236
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:49,490
I have a surprise
for you.

1237
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,190
(all gasp)

1238
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:57,100
A mannequin.
No, a dummy!

1239
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:03,300
Perfect in every detail,
except she couldn't hear
or speak.

1240
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:06,970
I congratulate
the murder victim.

1241
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:09,470
Except for being dead,
he was no dope.

1242
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:10,340
Nice going, sam.

1243
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:15,350
I hope everyone
realizes someone
in here is a murderer.

1244
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:17,850
For sake of ladies,

1245
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:20,250
Let's return
to drawing room.

1246
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:22,320
My son will cover twain.

1247
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,220
Why do i do
the dirty work?

1248
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:28,290
Because your mother
not here. Come, please.

1249
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:45,310
Excuse me.

1250
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:52,310
(thunder rumbling)

1251
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:53,510
I'm getting
a headache.

1252
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:56,350
Can't we turn off
that machine?

1253
01:09:56,350 --> 01:10:00,590
Maybe there's
some gadget
outside the window.

1254
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:07,730
Sorry, it's raining
this time.

1255
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:10,290
Let's sort the facts.

1256
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,800
It's now 12:30 a.M.

1257
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,200
Doors and windows
open at dawn.

1258
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,330
One of us will be
$1 million richer.

1259
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,870
One will go to
the gas chamber
and hang.

1260
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:24,910
One, <i> monsieur?</i>
Why not two?

1261
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:26,170
We all have associates.

1262
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,070
Why not four
or six or eight?

1263
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,410
I don't trust
any of you.

1264
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:34,950
I'm not taking the fall,
you understand?

1265
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:36,780
Not even for me, sam?

1266
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:40,520
Why don't you
fall in love
with the jap?

1267
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,950
Get back to case,
please.

1268
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,590
Time is late,
and my eyes are
getting tired.

1269
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,820
I thought they
always looked
like that.

1270
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:49,760
Knock it off, sam!

1271
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,930
This case
is getting
on my nerves.

1272
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:54,500
I'm sorry, slanty.

1273
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:58,400
Thank you. Now then,
facts, please.

1274
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,400
Mr. Twain predicts murder.

1275
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,800
Also predicts victim
at dining table.

1276
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,800
Correct?
Correct.

1277
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:07,170
Sorry. This is official.
Correct.

1278
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:09,840
Also predicts
time of murder

1279
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,880
And number of
stab wounds.

1280
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:16,050
How can this be unless
he in collaboration
with murderer?

1281
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:17,850
Maybe twain did it.

1282
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:19,150
Murdered himself?

1283
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:23,290
For what possible
reason? And how?

1284
01:11:23,290 --> 01:11:25,490
The motive
is simple. Ego.

1285
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:27,060
If we couldn't
solve this crime,

1286
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:30,730
He would be
named the world's
foremost detective.

1287
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:31,390
With his ego,

1288
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,300
Having to die
for it would seem
a small price.

1289
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:35,860
As to how,

1290
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:38,730
Any man who can
create these
electronic marvels

1291
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:44,100
Could devise
a machine to stab
himself in the back.

1292
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:48,580
Wonderful, darling.
Let's go to bed.

1293
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:49,380
One moment, please.

1294
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:52,480
Very interesting theory,
mr. Charleston,

1295
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:56,880
But you overlook one
very important point.

1296
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,950
What?

1297
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:58,980
Is stupid.

1298
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:02,050
Is most stupid theory
i ever heard.

1299
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:02,590
(chuckles)

1300
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:04,320
Do you have
a better one?

1301
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:04,720
Oh, yes.

1302
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:09,560
Much better one.
I have been
doing my homework.

1303
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,360
For example,
i have information

1304
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,860
That your wife's
portfolio of stocks

1305
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:18,600
Was seriously
depleted in latest
financial crisis.

1306
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,770
In short,
you are broke,
mr. Charleston.

1307
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:27,210
You have been borrowing
money at 17% interest
from mr. Lionel twain.

1308
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,440
Dickie, is this true?

1309
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,740
I was waiting
until your birthday.

1310
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:36,380
$1 million would buy
great many tight suits,

1311
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:37,610
Would it not,
mr. Charleston?

1312
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,680
See here, wang.
Dead broke, dickie?

1313
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,420
Almost, darling.
I have $1.17
and some stamps.

1314
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:45,290
But i did not
murder lionel twain.

1315
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:47,120
You believe that,
don't you, darling?

1316
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,720
We'll talk.
We'll see.

1317
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:51,060
It could have
been any one of you.

1318
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:58,070
Each of us left
that room, giving
ample opportunity.

1319
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:02,900
As for motives,
there's more than ego
and cash involved.

1320
01:13:02,910 --> 01:13:04,470
For example, revenge.

1321
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:05,540
Meaning what,
mr. Charleston?

1322
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:10,210
I'm not the only one
who's had experience
with mr. Twain.

1323
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:13,810
Did you know that
he was once
quite a ladies' man?

1324
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:16,150
Are you suggesting
that someone here...

1325
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:18,780
Was once in love
with lionel twain.

1326
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:24,350
He was engaged to
and jilted
miss jessica marbles.

1327
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:27,260
(exclaims in french)

1328
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,520
Jesus h. Christ!

1329
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,830
Jilted 54 years ago
at the altar

1330
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:34,930
In that same
baggy tweed outfit.

1331
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:38,930
Is this true, jessie?
I was not jilted.

1332
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:40,430
I walked out on him.

1333
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,440
He wanted to
fool around
before the wedding.

1334
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,610
Being the lady
you are, you refused.

1335
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:50,510
Not completely.
But it got out of hand.

1336
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,780
He was horrid,
but i didn't kill him.

1337
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:54,010
That's good enough
for me.

1338
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:55,410
What do you think,
frenchie?

1339
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:58,710
I'm not a frenchie.
I'm a belgie.

1340
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:04,250
As for other motives,
how about patricide?

1341
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:06,550
Killing one's own parent?

1342
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:11,490
Lionel twain was
the father of someone
in this room?

1343
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:14,390
Tess: He wasn't
my father.

1344
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:17,530
He was my uncle.

1345
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,330
He was very good to me.

1346
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:23,100
He would take me
to the circus.

1347
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:27,340
We stopped going
when i was about 26.

1348
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:30,510
I'm sorry, sam.

1349
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:34,240
Twenty-six? What the hell
kind of circus?

1350
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:34,710
Forgive me.

1351
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:37,710
I was talking
about patricide,
not unclecide.

1352
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,450
<i>Monsieur</i> twain may
have been your uncle,
miss skeffington,

1353
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:46,520
But he was
the illegitimate father
of <i> monsieur</i> sidney wang.

1354
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,460
Is not true.

1355
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:52,890
I was adopted.

1356
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,300
I have my papers.

1357
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:58,800
That's why i adopted
all my children.

1358
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,670
I was wondering.

1359
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:01,370
Oh...

1360
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:03,500
He love me
very much,

1361
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:07,210
But he was not
very observant.

1362
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:09,840
When i was 19,

1363
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,510
He called me
to his study,

1364
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:14,080
Noticed for first time
i was oriental,

1365
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,680
And kicked me
out of house.
I could have...

1366
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,710
Killed him,
<i>monsieur</i> wang.

1367
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,420
As easily as you,
mr. Perrier.

1368
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:25,190
Lionel twain killed
the only thing
you ever loved,

1369
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:29,160
Marie-louise cartier.

1370
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:36,060
(whimpering)

1371
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:43,670
Your sweetheart?

1372
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:47,910
My poodle.

1373
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:51,880
He was a most cruel man.

1374
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:57,310
<i>Monsieur</i> twain came
to france every season.

1375
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,280
To hunt poodles.

1376
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:05,020
When they brought me her
bloodied sequined collar,

1377
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:06,190
I vowed i would...

1378
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:10,260
Knock him off?
Yes. Gladly, if i could.

1379
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:13,260
But i did not.

1380
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,860
Someone here
beat me to it.

1381
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:18,600
So there's more than
one reason we was invited.

1382
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,670
Twain was testing
our skills as detectives,

1383
01:16:22,670 --> 01:16:25,340
And we all have motives
for doing him in.

1384
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:29,110
Have not yet
heard your motive,
mr. Diamond.

1385
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:31,570
My motive is unimportant.

1386
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:35,040
Let's just say
i hated him enough
to kill him.

1387
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:37,980
You are closed man,
mr. Diamond.

1388
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,920
You hide many things.

1389
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,220
Could it be that
mr. Twain discover
your secret?

1390
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:47,220
I don't know
what you're
talking about.

1391
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:51,530
We know different,
do we not,
miss skeffington?

1392
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:57,000
Twain met sam
in a gay bar.

1393
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,570
I was working on a case.
Working!

1394
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:03,040
Every night
for six months?

1395
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,100
For 50 bucks a day
and expenses.

1396
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:07,440
I hate them queeries.

1397
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:13,180
Twain had
polaroid pictures
of sam in drag.

1398
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:14,480
I was in disguise.

1399
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,110
Lots of dames
go in those joints.

1400
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,220
I never kissed nobody.

1401
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:22,490
I never did nothing to
a man that i wouldn't
do to a woman.

1402
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:25,250
And i never killed twain.

1403
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,560
Bitch.

1404
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:31,020
Most interesting.

1405
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:35,260
All had
perfect motives
for killing twain.

1406
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:39,330
Wonder which one
was one who done it.

1407
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:42,700
We still have
the night to
get through.

1408
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,600
If anyone is going to
solve this case,

1409
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,940
I say we all get
a good night's sleep.

1410
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:50,070
I suggest we all
lock our doors.

1411
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,910
One of us is
a mad killer,

1412
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:54,980
Not to be trusted.

1413
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:57,410
(thunder rumbling)

1414
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,780
(door locks)

1415
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:38,120
Pop?

1416
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:39,620
Yeah?

1417
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:42,950
Who do you think
is the murderer?

1418
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,490
Must sleep on it.

1419
01:18:44,490 --> 01:18:48,020
Will know in morning
when wake up.

1420
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:50,690
What if you
don't wake up?

1421
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:52,890
Then you did it.

1422
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:55,260
Go sleep, please.

1423
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:57,360
Good night, dad.

1424
01:18:57,370 --> 01:19:00,800
Should have
adopted pussycat.

1425
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:08,170
(hissing)

1426
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:11,240
Should i turn off
the steam, pop?

1427
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,140
(hissing continues)

1428
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:14,610
Not steam.

1429
01:19:14,610 --> 01:19:18,880
Someone just put
deadly snake in room.

1430
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,080
Wake me when
it come near bed.

1431
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:28,920
Dickie, darling,
if you're
the murderer,

1432
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,260
I'll still love you.

1433
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:32,990
It wouldn't be right
for us to make love,

1434
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:34,760
But i'd still
love you.

1435
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:38,700
No fear of that.
Let's see what we have...

1436
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:42,530
One missing, dead,
naked butler,

1437
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:45,200
One host with
a knife in his back

1438
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:48,470
And one poisonous
scorpion crawling
up our sheets.

1439
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:50,010
Dora: Is that
what that is?

1440
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:52,040
Yes. They can
kill instantly.

1441
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,740
I suggest
we don't move.

1442
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:56,780
For how long?

1443
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:59,980
Possibly the rest
of our lives.

1444
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:08,020
Good heavens!
I know who it is!

1445
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,290
Solvey-poo?

1446
01:20:09,290 --> 01:20:11,160
Yes, miss withers.

1447
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,360
The murderer is...

1448
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:14,160
Good god! Gas!

1449
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:17,260
I'm sorry.
I can't help it.
I'm old.

1450
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:20,430
No, the other
kind of gas.

1451
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:22,400
The kind that kills!

1452
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,600
Sometimes my gas...

1453
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,700
It's coming in
through the vent.

1454
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:31,640
(coughing)

1455
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:39,310
It's locked
from the outside.

1456
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:39,910
Help!

1457
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:44,020
It doesn't smell
that bad to me.

1458
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:46,450
Help!

1459
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:02,900
Did i do right, sam,
telling them about
the gay bar?

1460
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:03,800
Perfect.

1461
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,600
They took the bait
like a dumb halibut.

1462
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,340
Let them think
i'm a pansy.

1463
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,770
While they're
suspecting me,

1464
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:13,140
One of them will
let his pants down.

1465
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:18,480
Sam, why do you keep
naked muscle-man magazines?

1466
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,780
Suspects.
Always looking
for suspects.

1467
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:22,980
(ticking)

1468
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:26,590
What's that
ticking sound
i hear?

1469
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:36,330
"it is a bomb
in your room

1470
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:39,560
"that will go off
in 30 seconds."
signed, "the murderer."

1471
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:40,800
Quick, sam, the door!

1472
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,630
"p.S. The door
is locked."

1473
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:52,840
I'm sorry about this,
tess.

1474
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,080
And me owing you
all that money, too.

1475
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,940
That's okay.
What can we do?

1476
01:21:56,950 --> 01:22:01,950
I got an idea.
I don't know whether
this will work.

1477
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,180
Quick! Turn around!
I'm turned, sam.

1478
01:22:04,190 --> 01:22:06,250
Whatever happens,
don't turn back.

1479
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:07,150
But, sam, if anything...

1480
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:09,120
Do as i say!
I will, sam.

1481
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:13,260
Good, because i think
i'm gonna cry.

1482
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:15,830
(sam sobbing)

1483
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:23,200
(humming)

1484
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:30,070
What are you
doing here?

1485
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:31,870
There's no place
else to sleep.

1486
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:34,770
Sleep in the car,
you chauffeur.
Go, go!

1487
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:35,710
You aren't fair.

1488
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:38,110
I will tell everyone
about your toupee.

1489
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:39,340
They already know.

1490
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:40,950
Then why wear it?

1491
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:43,010
I didn't know
you knew.

1492
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:45,180
Certainly i know.

1493
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:47,720
It's a terrible toupee.

1494
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:49,650
(explosion)

1495
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:51,650
A bomb across the hall!

1496
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:54,420
Quickly.
The door! The door!

1497
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:02,560
It's locked
from the outside.

1498
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,360
You look taller to me.
Why is that?

1499
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:09,100
I don't understand.
I'm not getting taller.

1500
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:11,070
If you aren't
getting taller,

1501
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:13,070
There is only
one alternative.

1502
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:16,310
The room is
getting shorter.

1503
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:17,970
(exclaims in french)

1504
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:20,840
The ceiling is coming down!

1505
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:23,410
(shrieking)

1506
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:32,550
What will we do?
I don't know.

1507
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:37,420
But this is
how they make
goose liver pate.

1508
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:40,290
(screaming)

1509
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:11,590
Not so fast, please.

1510
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:13,990
Do not cross out
wang name.

1511
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:17,760
Cross out snake
instead.

1512
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:19,230
Nice shot, pop.

1513
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:22,800
Sure wish i weren't
such a heavy sleeper.

1514
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,570
And now,

1515
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:27,470
If you please,

1516
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:32,640
$1 million,
mr. Bensonmum.

1517
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:34,840
Banzai, pop!

1518
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:37,780
Very clever of you,
mr. Wang.

1519
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:42,380
Oh, yes.
As you can see,
i can see.

1520
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:44,350
So i see.

1521
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:49,320
Tell me, how did you
deduce it was me?

1522
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:54,060
Went back to theory
seldom used today.

1523
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,330
Butler did it.

1524
01:24:57,590 --> 01:24:59,530
I hadn't thought of that.

1525
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:03,430
How do you account for
my body in the kitchen?

1526
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:07,800
Body made of plastic,
same as plastic cook.

1527
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:11,470
While we examine
plastic butler,

1528
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:14,170
You murder lionel twain.

1529
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:17,510
You're a clever little
laundryman, mr. Wang.

1530
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:19,780
But not quite
clever enough!

1531
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:23,180
I'll take
that $1 million,

1532
01:25:23,180 --> 01:25:27,750
Bensonmum,
alias irving goldman.

1533
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,490
Irving goldman?

1534
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:36,830
Yes. Irving goldman
was the attorney of
the late lionel twain.

1535
01:25:36,830 --> 01:25:38,530
Lionel twain died
five years ago.

1536
01:25:38,530 --> 01:25:43,160
His body was recently found
in goldman's filing cabinet.

1537
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:46,330
Am i correct,
mr. Goldman?

1538
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:49,700
Yeah. Correct,
miss marbles.

1539
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:52,970
But how did you
escape the poison gas?

1540
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:54,940
Quite simple.
I covered my mouth

1541
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:58,910
And let miss withers
breathe in the gas.

1542
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:00,980
Sicky-poo.

1543
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:02,350
Yes, dear, i know.

1544
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:04,250
The million dollars,
please.

1545
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:08,250
I wouldn't, goldman.
Or is it goldman?

1546
01:26:08,250 --> 01:26:11,920
Actually, it's
mr. Marvin metzler.

1547
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,720
Marvin metzler?

1548
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:18,830
Very good, mr. Charleston,

1549
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:21,430
But how did you know?

1550
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:23,930
The bill in the
dead butler's hand

1551
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:26,700
Said the entire
weekend was catered.

1552
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:28,830
Only an accountant
would save that.

1553
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,500
Get the money.
Let's go.
In a moment, darling.

1554
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:34,070
Goldman died last month
while skiing.

1555
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:37,510
He jumped 200 feet
into a low-flying plane.

1556
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:38,610
I can't wait much longer.

1557
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:42,750
You've not
lost your touch,
mr. Charleston,

1558
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:46,120
But how did you elude
the deadly scorpion?

1559
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,520
We didn't.
He stung dora.

1560
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,820
We've 15 minutes
to get help.

1561
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:53,760
Explain later, dickie.
We'll make it, darling.
Never fear.

1562
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:54,620
The money,
mr. Metzler?

1563
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:56,860
Perrier: Belongs to me,
<i>monsieur!</i>

1564
01:26:56,860 --> 01:27:00,430
Marcel is one
of the world's
strongest men.

1565
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:05,400
He stopped your ceiling
from crushing us
at 4'5".

1566
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,670
It may be months before
we straighten up again,

1567
01:27:09,670 --> 01:27:14,740
But $1 million will buy
a lot of back braces.

1568
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,180
Right, miss irene twain,

1569
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:21,550
Daughter of lionel?

1570
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,080
What?

1571
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:27,120
I prefer to
be called rita.

1572
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:30,550
How did you know?

1573
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:35,020
Never underestimate
a frenchman's nostrils,
miss twain.

1574
01:27:35,030 --> 01:27:39,990
At dinner tonight,
i smelled your
chanel no. 5.

1575
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,760
It was you
who did away
with all of them!

1576
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:46,630
Metzler, goldman
and your father.

1577
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,370
In fact,
if you had your way,

1578
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:50,870
You'd like to do
away with all men,

1579
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:52,140
Wouldn't you,
miss twain?

1580
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:55,640
Men have
made you ashamed
and made you suffer

1581
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:59,540
Because you were
born with brains,
talent, money,

1582
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:03,550
Everything but what
you most desired,

1583
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:05,150
Beauty.

1584
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:09,990
Miss twain, as a man,
you are barely passable,

1585
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:12,020
But as a woman,

1586
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:13,890
You are a dog.

1587
01:28:13,890 --> 01:28:17,760
That's your opinion,
big boy.

1588
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:20,800
And now my money,
please.

1589
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:26,300
With luck, i can still
arrive at maxim's
in time for dinner.

1590
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:28,900
Sam: Just order
a tuna sandwich!

1591
01:28:28,900 --> 01:28:31,200
That dough
belongs to me.

1592
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:32,740
I'm alive
and kicking.

1593
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:35,640
Miss skeffington
dropped your bomb
down the toilet.

1594
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,940
It exploded
as she flushed.

1595
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:40,580
The seat barely
missed her head.

1596
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:42,110
(coughing)

1597
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:44,550
I'm all right, j.J.

1598
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,450
J.J.?

1599
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:52,750
That's right, folks.
He outsmarted us all.

1600
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:57,260
The real sam diamond
is behind that desk.

1601
01:28:57,260 --> 01:29:00,890
My name is loomis,
j.J. Loomis.
I'm an actor.

1602
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:02,330
I do impressions.

1603
01:29:02,330 --> 01:29:05,960
I've done the carson show
six times.

1604
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,560
Diamond hired me
for the weekend.

1605
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:10,870
Miss skeffington
is vilma norman,

1606
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:14,840
A cocktail waitress
at the waterbed motel.

1607
01:29:14,970 --> 01:29:17,000
Hi.
Hello.

1608
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:20,210
Diamond hated all of you.
You all earned big money.

1609
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:23,480
Diamond had that crummy
san francisco office.

1610
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:27,550
If he proved he was best,
he'd get your rich clients.

1611
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:31,080
But since i figured it out,

1612
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:35,820
I figure that money
belongs to me.

1613
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:39,660
Isn't that right,
mr. Diamond?

1614
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:43,530
Wrong.

1615
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:47,190
That would have
been too obvious.

1616
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:50,360
My dear colleagues,
what you all seem
to overlook

1617
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:53,600
Is the most
simple solution.

1618
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,870
I am indeed

1619
01:29:55,870 --> 01:29:57,900
Lionel twain.

1620
01:29:58,570 --> 01:30:00,540
(all gasp)

1621
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:05,310
You've all been
so clever for so long,

1622
01:30:05,310 --> 01:30:07,480
You've forgotten
to be humble.

1623
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,750
You've tricked and
fooled your readers
for years.

1624
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:14,780
You've tortured us
with surprise endings
that made no sense.

1625
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:17,990
You've introduced
characters in
the last chapter

1626
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:20,850
That weren't in
the book before.

1627
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:24,260
You've left out clues
and information

1628
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:28,330
That we needed to
guess who did it.

1629
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:32,530
But now the tables
are turned.

1630
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:36,330
Millions of angry
mystery readers

1631
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:39,500
Are now getting
their revenge.

1632
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:42,770
When the world learns
i've outsmarted you,

1633
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:47,510
They'll be selling your
$1.95 books for 12 cents.

1634
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:50,980
It's check-out time,
ladies and gentlemen.

1635
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:53,750
I have your bills ready.

1636
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:57,720
Credit cards
will be accepted.

1637
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,410
The scorpion
was a fake?

1638
01:31:20,410 --> 01:31:22,340
Everything.
The bridge,
the maid.

1639
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:25,140
You're sure
about the scorpion?

1640
01:31:25,150 --> 01:31:27,350
Positive.
Even the fog.

1641
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:30,580
He made the fog
with dry ice. Look.

1642
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:33,120
How awfully
unromantic!

1643
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,390
If he was
lionel twain,

1644
01:31:41,390 --> 01:31:44,760
You must really
be sam diamond.

1645
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:46,060
Right.

1646
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:49,230
I was in disguise,
in disguise, in disguise.

1647
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:52,270
You work hard
in this racket.

1648
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:55,340
Will we be seeing
each other again?

1649
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:59,910
Well, that depends.
I'll be around
if you need me.

1650
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:03,280
All you got to
do is whistle.

1651
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:06,380
You do know
how to whistle?

1652
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:08,210
Certainly.
What do you mean?

1653
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:12,050
Never mind.
You ruined it.

1654
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:18,890
I don't understand.
Was there a murder?

1655
01:32:18,890 --> 01:32:21,630
Yes. Killed good weekend.

1656
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:23,530
Drive, please.

1657
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,430
(laughing)
