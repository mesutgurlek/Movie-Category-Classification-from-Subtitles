on the operating table within six hours.

that she's kept in a reclined position,

and that a continuous watch
is kept on her IV.

that she remain calm.

this is the operator, Captain Oveur.

Then why didn't you take the job
that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

97

You know I haven't been able
to get near a plane since the war.

98

Even if I could,

99

they wouldn't hire me
because of my war record.

You expect me to believe that?

It's the truth.

105

is your record since the war.

you can accept any real responsibility.

Is yours.

159

No, I've been nervous lots of times.

166
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:09,312
Hi, we'll be taking off real soon,
so I better fasten you in tight.

Thank you.

Oh, Mother, this is so exciting.

169
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,443
I know, but remember,
you must get some rest.

That's good advice.

I haven't flown for a long time.

212

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Oveur speaking.

213
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,163
- Here you go.
- We'll be cruising

- at 36,000 feet this evening.
- Stewardess?

215
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:39,128
Our arrival time in Chicago
will be 10:45 p.m. Central time.

216

is currently 62 degrees,

with a 20% chance of precipitation.

Yes. Thank you.

- Ted! What are you doing here?
- Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

223
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,530
You shouldn't have come.
I don't have time now.

224
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,741
- Oh, stewardess?
- Excuse me.

225
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,034
But...

226
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,965
No wonder you're upset.

227
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,675
She's lovely.

228
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,471
And a darling figure.

231

It's a shame you two don't get along.

232
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,191
Yes, I know.

233
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,236
Things used to be different.

234
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,615
I remember when we first met.

235
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,993
It was during the war.

236
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,746
I was in the Air Force,

237
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,916
stationed in Drambuie
off the Barbary Coast.

238

It was a rough place,

242
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,847
It was worse than Detroit.

243
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,360
The mood in the place
was downright ugly.

244
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,488
You wouldn't walk in there
unless you knew how to use your fists.

245
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:33,284
You could count on a fight
breaking out almost every night.

I didn't go there that
night to fall in love.

00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,233
I just dropped in for
a couple of drinks.

But suddenly, there she was.

251
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,957
I was captivated, entranced.
It hit me like a thunderbolt.

252
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,917
I had to ask the guy next to me
to pinch me

253
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,294
to make sure I wasn't dreaming.

254
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:16,345
I was afraid to approach her.
But that night, fate was on my side.

are probably too busy

318
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,606
Sure. You ever been in a cockpit before?

319
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,943
No, sir,
I've never been up in a plane before.

320
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,445
Have you ever seen
a grown man naked?

321
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,364
Do you want me to check
the weather, Clarence?

322
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,533
No, why don't you take care of it?

323
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:38,286
Joey, do you ever
hang around a gymnasium?

324
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,330
We'd better get back now, Joey.

325
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:42,624
No, Joey can stay here
for a while if he'd like.

326
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,960
- Could I?
- Okay. If you don't get in the way.

327
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,045
ROGER: Flight 209'er to Denver radio.

328
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,339
Climbing to cruise at 42,000.

329
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,676
Will report again over Lincoln.
Over and out.

330
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,886
Wait a minute. I know you.

331
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,847
You're Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

332
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,975
You play basketball
for the Los Angeles Lakers.

333
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:03,395
I'm sorry, son, but you must
have me confused with someone else.

334
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,398
My name is Roger Murdock.
I'm the co-pilot.

335
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,610
You are Kareem. I've seen you play.
My dad's got season tickets.

336
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,489
I think you should go back
to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?

337
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:18,410
No, he's not bothering anyone.
Let him stay here.

338
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:20,954
All right, but just remember,

339
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,582
my name is Roger Murdock.

340
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,250
I'm an airline pilot.

341
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,127
I think you're the greatest,

342
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:30,672
but my dad says
you don't work hard enough on defense.

343
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:35,761
And he says that lots of times,
you don't even run downcourt.

344
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,306
And that you don't really try
except during the playoffs.

345
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:41,099
The hell I don't!

346
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,436
Listen, kid.

347
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,105
I've been hearing that crap
ever since I was at UCLA.

348
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:50,484
I'm out there
busting my buns every night.

349
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,611
Tell your old man
to drag Walton and Lanier

350
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,280
up and down the court for 48 minutes.

351
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,038
Joey?

352
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:06,333
You like movies about gladiators?

353
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,215
Elaine, just hear me out.

354
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:18,011
I know things haven't been right
for a long time, but it'll be different.

355
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,722
Like it was in the beginning, remember?

356
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:22,724
I remember everything.

357
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,978
All I have are memories.

358
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,398
Mostly, I remember the nights
when we were together.

359
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:33,068
I remember how you used to hold me.

360
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,280
How I used to sit on your face
and wriggle,

361
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:41,117
and afterwards how we'd watch
till the sun came up.

362
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,870
When it did, it was almost like...

363
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:49,084
Like each new day
was created only for us.

364
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:52,087
That's the way
I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.

365
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,797
But it won't be.

366
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,092
Not as long as you insist
on living in the past.

367
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,064
COMMANDER: You're too low, Ted.
You're too low.

368
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:20,031
NURSE: You mustn't believe everything
that you see.

369
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,868
The mind can play tricks on people.

370
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,786
Pain. Pain.

371
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:27,414
- He looks so happy today, doesn't he?
- Okay, I'll be back.

372
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,791
Thank you, thank you.
You look so happy today.

373
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:34,546
DOCTOR: Okay, Robert, slip them down.
This won't hurt much.

374
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,964
NURSE: Give me a big smile.

375
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,717
You got a telegram
from headquarters today.

376
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,385
Headquarters! What is it?

377
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,637
Well, it's a big building
where generals meet,

378
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,556
but that's not important right now.

379
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,891
They've cleared you of any blame

380
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,392
for what happened on that raid.

381
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,727
Isn't that good news?

382
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:50,812
Is it?

383
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:55,442
Because of my mistake,
six men didn't return from that raid.

384
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:59,696
Seven, Lieutenant Zipp
died this morning.

385
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,948
But Dr. Sandier says
you'll be out in a week.

386
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:03,783
Isn't that wonderful?

387
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,913
I wish I could say the same
for George Zipp.

388
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,581
Be patient, Ted.

389
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,918
Nobody expects you
to get over this immediately.

390

MAN: Hey, Striker. How about a break?
I'm getting tired.

391
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,090
Yeah, all right. Take five.

392
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,135
Thanks.

393

I've found a wonderful apartment for us.

394

It has a brick fireplace
and a cute little bedroom

395

with mirrors on the ceiling, and...

It's this way!

401

00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,581
What's his problem?

Would you like some coffee
before we serve dinner?

No. No, thank you.

417
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,581
Would either of you like
another cup of coffee?

418
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,333
I will, but Jim won't.

419
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:38,294
I think I will have another cup of coffee.

a second cup of coffee at home.

- Yes?

There's a little girl onboard, up front,

423
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,688
- who's ill and, well...
- Oh, yes, I saw. Poor child.

424
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,692
Could I borrow your guitar?
I thought maybe I could cheer her up.

00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,362
- Oh, of course.

you'd like to hear a song.

This is one of my favorites.

439
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,902
(SINGING) I traveled the banks
of the River of Jordan

440
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:48,406
To find where it flows to the sea

441
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:53,411
I looked in the eyes
of the cold and the hungry

442
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:57,999
And I saw that I was looking at me

443
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:04,130
And I wanted to know
if life had a purpose

444
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,550
And what it all means in the end

445
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:12,180
In the silence I listened
to voices inside me

446
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:16,976
And they told me again and again

447
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,773
There is only one river

448
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:25,110
There is only one sea

We've been waiting for you.

- Who wants to be first?
- Go ahead, Clarence. I got it.

- How's the weather?

It'll help you better prepare storing foods

477
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:14,677
for the up and coming monsoon months.

478
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:19,557
Also, Supperware products
are ideal for storing leftovers

479
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:22,477
to help stretch your food dollar.

480
00:34:23,312 --> 00:34:29,150
This 2-quart Seals-M-Rite container
keeps hot dog buns fresh for days.

481
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,819
You must understand,
these people had been

482
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,072
completely isolated from civilization.

483
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,492
No one had ever outlined
a physical fitness program for them,

484
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,661
and they had no athletic equipment.

485
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,537
I started them on simple calisthenics,

486
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:44,249
then gradually worked them up
to rudimentary game skills.

487
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,751
And finally,
advanced competitive theory.

488
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,213
I was patient with them,
and they were eager to learn.

489
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,173
They seemed to enjoy themselves.

490
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:55,385
It was probably due to the advanced
American teaching techniques

491
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,179
that we were able to bridge
the generations of isolation

492
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:00,807
and communicate so successfully
with the Molombos.

493
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,524
I think they're getting the hang of it.

494
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,776
When we re-enlist,
I'll teach them baseball.

495
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,737
Ted, I don't wanna stay here.

496
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:19,075
It's time for us to go back home
to the plans we made before the war.

497
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:24,163
A lot of people made plans
before the war.

498
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:25,331
Like George Zipp.

499
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:32,672
It was at that moment that I first realized

500
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,425
Elaine had doubts
about our relationship.

501
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:39,387
And that, as much as anything else,
led to my drinking problem.

502
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,140
We did come back to the States.

503
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,767
I tried a number of jobs.

504
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:48,187
Well, I could go on for hours,
but I'd probably start to bore you.

505
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:50,189
You know, I really couldn't blame Elaine.

506
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:52,066
She wanted a career.

507
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,324
I can't stand it.

508
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:00,825
What is it?

509
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,077
- Yes?
- Oh, it's my stomach.

510
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:07,498
I haven't felt this awful
since we saw that Ronald Reagan film.

511
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:10,960
I'll see if I can find some Dramamine.

512
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:21,429
Captain, one of the woman passengers
is very sick.

Airsick?

514
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:26,100
ELAINE: I think so,
but I've never seen it so acute.

515
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:31,272
Find out if there's a doctor on board
as quietly as you can.

516
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:37,153
Joey, have you ever been in a...

517
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,988
In a Turkish prison?

518
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:44,243
I shouldn't have had
that second cup of coffee.

I'm sorry I had to wake you.
I'm just looking for a doctor.

There's nothing to worry about.

Stewardess?

525
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:07,642
I think the man sitting next to me
is a doctor.

526
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,311
Sir? Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry I have to wake you.

527
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:11,729
Are you a doctor?

528
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:12,980
That's right.

529
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:14,774
We have some passengers
that are very sick.

530
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:18,111
- Could you come take a look at them?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

531

I'll be back in a minute.

534
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,954
You'd better tell the captain,
we've got to land as soon as we can.

535
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,664
This woman has to be gotten
to a hospital.

536
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,583
A hospital, what is it?

537
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,461
It's a big building with patients.
But that's not important right now.

538
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:19,630
- Tell the captain I must speak to him.
- Certainly.

539

Victor, we're running into
some heavy weather, can you...

Roger, take over!

- Captain, how soon can you land?
- I can't tell.

542
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,254
- You can tell me, I'm a doctor.
- No, I mean, I'm just not sure.

- Well, can't you take a guess?
- Well, not for another two hours.

You can't take a guess
for another two hours?

No, no, no. I mean,
we can't land for another two hours.

- What is it, Doctor? What's going on?
- I'm not sure.

I haven't seen anything like this
since the Anita Bryant concert.

What was it we had for dinner tonight?

Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.

Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
What did he have?

00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:06,279
He had fish.

A couple points of interest.

563

We're now flying over Hoover Dam,
and a little later on,

564
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,676
we'll pass just to the south
of the Grand Canyon.

and landing in Chicago.

One thing, do you know
what he had for dinner?

574
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,165
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?

and Randy said
there are five more cases,

579
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:16,599
and they all had fish, too.

580
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,517
And the copilot had fish.

will become violently ill
in the next half-hour.

Extremely serious.

It starts with a slight fever,
dryness of the throat.

As the virus penetrates
the red blood cells,

the victim becomes dizzy,
begins to experience an itching, a rash.

590

From there, the poison goes to work
on the central nervous system,

causing severe muscle spasms,
followed by the inevitable drooling.

STEVE: Elaine, right next to the throttle
is the air-speed gauge.

634
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:06,268
What speed does it indicate?

635
00:44:08,522 --> 00:44:10,856
520 miles per hour.

636
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,568
Good. Very good.
Now check your altitude.

637
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:18,823
That's the dial just below and to
the right of the air-speed indicator.

Oh, my God!
The automatic pilot, it's deflating!

643

Now, Elaine, don't panic.

644
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,472
On the belt line of the automatic pilot,
there is a hollow tube.

645
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:47,768
Now that is the manual inflation nozzle.
Pull it out and blow on it.

Calm down, now get back to your seat.
I'll take care of this problem now.

Calm down! Get a hold of yourself.

790
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,187
- Sister, please. I'll handle this.
- Just try and get a hold of yourself.

791

I've gotta get out of here!
Ahhh!

792

I know, but this guy doing the flying
has no airline experience at all.

810
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:26,281
He's a menace to himself
and everything else in the air.

00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:27,532
Yes, birds too.

812
00:55:27,617 --> 00:55:31,077
Okay, okay, he's a terrible risk.
But what other choice have we got?

813
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:33,747
That's the whole story there, Rex.
Everything we know.

814
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:38,168
All right, Steve, let's face a few facts.

815
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,337
As you know, I flew with this man,
Striker, during the war.

816
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:42,839
He's gonna have enough on his mind
without worrying about those times

817
00:55:42,924 --> 00:55:44,716
when things weren't so good.

818
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,843
Well, right now, things aren't so good.

819
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:48,553
Let me tell you something, Steve.

820
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:50,430
Ted Striker was
a top-notch squadron leader,

821
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:52,432
a long time ago.

822
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:56,436
Look, Rex, I want you to get on the horn
and talk that guy down.

823
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:59,814
Now, you're gonna have to let him
get the feel of that airplane on the way.

824
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:01,358
Then you'll have to talk him
onto the approach.

825
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:04,903
So help me, you'll have to talk him
right down to the ground!

826
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,072
Very well.

827
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:10,742
- Put Striker on the speaker.
- Okay, use my radio over there.

828
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:15,539
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit drinking.

829
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,376
Now, you can work them
direct from here, Captain.

830
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,627
Thanks.

831
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:23,880
Striker?

832
00:56:25,258 --> 00:56:27,801
Striker, this is
Captain Rex Kramer speaking.

833
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:34,599
Yes, Captain Kramer.
Read you loud and clear.

834
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,814
All right. It's obvious you remember me.

835
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,482
So, what do you say you and I

836
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:45,235
just forget about everything
except what we have to do now?

837
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:48,071
Let's not kid each other, Kramer.

838
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,407
You know I've never flown
a bucket like this!

839
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:52,492
I'm gonna need all the luck there is.

840
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,411
Stand by, Striker.

841
00:56:55,288 --> 00:56:56,955
Our one hope is to build this man up.

842
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:00,166
I've gotta give him
all the confidence I can.

843
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:01,626
Striker?

844
00:57:01,711 --> 00:57:03,753
Have you ever flown
a multi-engine plane before?

845
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:04,921
TED: No. Never.

846
00:57:05,006 --> 00:57:07,048
Shit. This is a goddamn waste of time!

847
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:08,758
There's no way he can land this plane!

848
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:11,928
STEVE: Grab a hold of yourself.
You gotta talk him down. You gotta.

849
00:57:12,013 --> 00:57:13,221
REX: Route him into Lake Michigan.

850
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:15,432
At least he'll avoid
killing innocent people.

851
00:57:15,725 --> 00:57:18,226
You're the only chance they've got!

852
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:22,188
All right.

853
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:26,026
Striker, you listen, and you listen close.

854
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,446
Flying a plane is no different
than riding a bicycle.

855
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:33,450
Just a lot harder
to put baseball cards in the spokes.

856
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:35,327
Now first, I want you to get
the feel of the plane.

857
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,705
Later, we'll run down
the landing procedure.

(EXPLODES)

859
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:46,004
All right, now I want you
to disengage the automatic pilot.

860
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,465
But watch out you don't make
any violent control movements

861
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:49,799
like you did in the fighter plane.

862
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:53,803
All right, I'm going to unlock
the automatic pilot.

863
00:57:59,352 --> 00:58:01,478
REX: Just remember,
the controls will feel very heavy

864
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,063
compared to a fighter.

865
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:08,234
Don't worry about that.
It's perfectly normal.

866
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,665
Now, one more thing,

867
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:23,375
is somebody there
who can work the radio

868
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:25,627
and leave you free for flying?

869
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,754
Yes. The stewardess is here with me.

870
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,632
Good. Have her sit in the copilot's seat.

871
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:35,887
Elaine, he wants you to sit
in the copilot's seat.

872
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:46,606
What's going on?
We have a right to know the truth.

873
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:50,610
All right, I'm gonna level with you all.

874
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,905
The most important thing now
is that you remain calm.

875
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,116
There is no reason to panic.

876
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:59,494
Now, it is true
that one of the crew members is ill.

877
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:01,162
Slightly ill.

878
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:04,207
But the other two pilots are just fine.

879
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,376
They're at the controls flying the plane,

880
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,962
free to pursue a life
of religious fulfillment.

881

The radio's all yours now.

882
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:14,134
And keep an eye on that
number three engine gauge, over there.

883

885
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:22,142
REX: Striker, before we start,
I'd like to say something.

886
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:26,062
I know that right now
things must look pretty rough up there,

887
00:59:26,147 --> 00:59:29,023
but if you do what I tell you,
when I tell you to do it,

888
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:30,734
there's no reason
why you shouldn't have

889
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:32,527
complete confidence in your chances

890
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,321
to come out of this thing alive
and in one piece.

891
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,991
Striker, what kind of weather
you in up there?

892
00:59:38,993 --> 00:59:40,201
Rain.

893
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:41,536
And a little ice.

894
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:43,371
And a little ice.

895
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,165
How's it handling?

896
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,002
It's sluggish, like a wet sponge.

like a wet sponge.

899
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:55,175
All right, Striker. You're doing just fine.

900
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:59,512
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know
how much I hate his guts.

901

It's a damn good thing you don't know
how much he hates your guts.

- I speak jive.
- Oh, good.

910
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:28,124
He said that he's in great pain,

911
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:29,793
and he wants to know
if you can help him.

912
01:00:29,877 --> 01:00:31,753
All right.
Would you tell him to just relax,

913
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:35,173
and I'll be back as soon as I can
with some medicine.

1253
01:20:56,978 --> 01:20:58,729
Okay. Have a nice day.

1254
01:20:58,813 --> 01:21:00,814
Thank you for flying Trans American.

1255
01:21:01,691 --> 01:21:04,192
REX: Loneliness, that's the bottom line.

1256
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:06,862
I was never happy as a child.

1257
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:08,905
Christmas, Ted,
what does that mean to you?

1258
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:10,574
To me, it was a living hell.

1259
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:13,910
Do you know what it's like
to fall in the mud and get kicked,

1260
01:21:13,995 --> 01:21:16,329
in the head, by an iron boot?

1261
01:21:17,707 --> 01:21:20,208
Of course you don't.
No one does. That never happens.

1262
01:21:20,293 --> 01:21:22,461
I'm sorry, Ted.
That's a dumb question. Skip that.

1263
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,797
Hurry, hurry.

1264
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,967
Okay, folks. There you go.

1265
01:21:29,052 --> 01:21:30,635
Have a nice day.

1268
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:48,653
Municipal bonds, Ted.
I'm talking double-A rating.

1269
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:50,113
The best investment in America.

1270
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:25,407
Well, I'll give him another 20 minutes.

1271
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:26,783
But that's it.
