We'll meet tonight

665
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:01,175
8:00, Pier 17,
base of the silo and...

666
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,313
forget the password.

667
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,656
Oh, now you tell me.

668
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,217
Oh, hey, there he is.
Oh, my God, that's him.

669
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:10,229
I got to go.

670
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,230
Guy in the raincoat. Get him!

671
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,231
I see you tonight. Sorry.

672
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:13,232
OFFICER:
Stop!

673
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,665

Get back here, you creep!

674

<i>(sighs)</i>

675
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:40,882
So, we've got five minutes
to get into position.

676
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:42,087
I secured the rooftop.

677
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,527
The equipment's good to go

678
00:32:43,563 --> 00:32:44,757
and I just have to say

679
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:48,790
it is such an honor to be
working with the legendary...

680
00:32:48,835 --> 00:32:51,895
Clark Devlin?

681
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,937
I'm Del Blaine.

682
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:58,808
Have we met before?

683
00:32:58,845 --> 00:33:00,745
No.

684
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,338
Good.

685
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:05,179
Okay, Del Blaine, let's do
what we've come here to do.

686
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:07,209
I'll follow you.

687
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:10,015
Ladies first.

688
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:12,286
Okay.

689
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,690
A couple of details changed
from what was in the file.

690
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,719
You read it?

691
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:19,731
The files are crap.

692
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:20,857
Give me the
short version.

693
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,561
Deitrich Banning's
holding a meeting

694
00:33:22,602 --> 00:33:24,934
of international
water company CEOs.

695
00:33:24,971 --> 00:33:26,199
We think he's trying
to force them

696
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,570
into selling
their companies to him.

697
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:28,801
Where are you going?

698
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:29,865
Huh?

699
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:31,137
I'm thinking.

700
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,838
We had Agent Wallace
working undercover

701
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:34,141
at his bottled water factory.

702
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,374
That is, until last week.

703
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:37,006
Wallace calls us
on his cell phone

704
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,677
to tell us that the operation
had reached critical mass

705
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:40,879
and, suddenly, wham! Dead.

706
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:56,262
As you requested, a Klineholtz
bolt-action nine-millimeter

707
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:59,601
titanium folding stock with
20-time infrared sniper-scope

708
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:01,664
and counterweighted
micro-rifled barrel.

709
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:05,676
My favorite gun.

710
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,077
But I don't kill
people anymore.

711
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:09,081
Killing?

712
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:10,878
You're planting a bug.

713
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:14,409
It was all in that "crap" file.

714
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:16,250

It's critical we get

BANNING:
In the year 2001

729
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:59,882
$35 billion worth of bottled
water was consumed worldwide.

730
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:03,588
Today, bottled water costs more
per gallon than gasoline.

731
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:07,895
We, my friends,
are the new oil barons.

<i>BANNING (through headset):
We at Banning Springs</i>

733
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:11,032
have developed
a new filtration process

734
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,628
that would protect your assets

735

that's coming.

737
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:18,939
CSA would be my bet.

You've heard what I have to say.

Now I'd like to hear you.

740
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:28,644
How much is this plan
going to cost us?

741
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:31,156
It won't cost you a penny,
out of pocket.

742
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,555

Banning says he's got
the only process

745
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,086
to make their water safe.

746
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:40,621
But to use it,
they've got to give him

747
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,463
half of their companies?

748
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:43,763
He's trying to muscle
these guys

749
00:36:43,803 --> 00:36:45,771
into selling
their companies to him.

750
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:47,534
Banning says that their
water sources are in danger.

751
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:49,837
Something about everyone
being defenseless

against more deadly
forms of bacteria.

JIMMY:
You and Banning seem very close.

1162
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:02,334
Tell me about his work.

1163
00:54:02,373 --> 00:54:05,137
I don't want
to talk about him.

1164

When I can't sleep at night,
which is quite often

I step into my
laboratory and I play.

come over and play.

That would be very nice.

1174

00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:42,072
I have a small problem...
trusting people.

1176

I don't know if I can trust
myself with you, Deitrich.

Well, maybe we can come up

Her name's Del Blaine.
She's CSA.

You told me you
dealt with Devlin

He's all over Cheryl.

something about that?

No.

Yes, tell us.

01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:50,141
Why it won't work?

1683
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:53,445
This is the northern
hemisphere, correct?

1684
01:15:53,483 --> 01:15:55,974
You incubated insects native
to the southern hemisphere.

1685
01:15:56,019 --> 01:16:00,479
So, simply, it is too cold
for them to mature sexually...

much like Simms here.

1687

Therefore...

1688
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:05,995
they won't mate.

1689
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:09,294
Therefore,
they won't seek out water.

1690
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:11,027
Is this true?

1691
01:16:11,068 --> 01:16:14,697
No, I knew a girl once,
in college, quite well.

1692

Very well.

1693

1694

No, Simms, the bugs.

Jimmy.

2138
01:34:56,792 --> 01:34:57,759
What do you...?

2141
01:35:01,463 --> 01:35:03,397
She smile the whole movie.

2142
01:35:03,432 --> 01:35:05,764
Waste of film, waste of time.

2143
01:35:05,801 --> 01:35:08,463
What is she doing?

2144
01:35:08,504 --> 01:35:09,266
Hit me!

2145
01:35:09,305 --> 01:35:09,964
Oh, no!

2146
01:35:11,006 --> 01:35:12,598
You're fast.

2147
01:35:12,641 --> 01:35:13,972
But I'm faster.

2148
01:35:14,009 --> 01:35:16,705
Good God!
