<i>RADIO: It is a beautiful day in
Chicago. Temperatures in the 70's.</i>

2
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,315
<i>Right now, 75 at the lakefront,
74 at Midway, 73 at O'Hare.</i>

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,233
FERRIS' MUM: Ferris Ferris Tom!

4
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,318
- (TOM) What's the matter?
- It's Ferris Look at him

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,360
TOM: Ferris?

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,269
He doesn't have a fever, but his
stomach hurts and he's seeing spots

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,268
- What's the matter, Ferris?
- Papa?

8
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,314
Feel his hands,
they're cold and clammy

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,159
- I'm fine I'll get up
- No!

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,477
- I have a test today
- No

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,834
I must take it I want to go to a good
college, so I can have a fruitful life

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,271
MUM: Honey, you're not
going to school like this

13
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,873
- What's his problem?
- He doesn't feel well

14
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,877
Dry that one out,
you can fertilise the lawn

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,119
Jeanie, is that you?

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,790
I can't see that far Jeanie?

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,629
Jeanie, I

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,836
- Bite the big one, junior
- Jeanie, you get to school

19
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,955
If I was bleeding out my eyes, you'd
make me go to school It's so unfair

20
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:58,396
Jeanie, don't be upset with me
You have your health, be thankful

21
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,912
That's it! I want out of this family

22
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:13,277
I'm okay I'll just sleep
I'll have an aspirin around noon

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,712
I'm showing some houses
to that family from Vermont today

24
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,277
My office will know just where I am
if you need me

25
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,271
- I'll check on you too, pal
- I have such loving, caring parents

26
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,076
You're both very special people

27
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,678
- You get better, pumpkin
- Okay, pumpkin

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,793
I'll be home at six sharp
If you need anything, call

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,275
Ringy-dingy

30
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,829
- We love you, sweetie
- I love you, too

31
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,313
Call if you need us

32
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,279
They bought it

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,439
ROCK MUSIC SOUNDTRACK

34
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,596
Incredible! A terrible performance,
and they never doubted it for a second

35
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,994
How could I be expected
to handle school on a day like this?

36
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,390
This is my ninth sick day It's tough
coming up with new illnesses

37
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,232
If I go for ten, I'll have to barf up a lung
So I'd better make this one count

38
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,957
The key to faking out the parents
is the clammy hands

39
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,438
It's a good non-specific symptom
I'm a big believer in it

40
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,155
A lot of people will tell you
to go for a phoney fever

41
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,708
But if you get a nervous mother,
you could wind up in a doctor's office

42
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,434
You fake a stomach cramp

43
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,191
When you're bent over wailing,
you lick your palms

44
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,597
It's childish and stupid,
but then, so is high school

45
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,994
Life moves pretty fast

46
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,752
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you could miss it

47
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,557
I do have a test today,
that wasn't bullshit

48
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,992
It's on European socialism
What's the point?

49
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,479
I'm not European, so who
gives a crap if they're socialists?

50
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,389
They could be fascist anarchists,
it still wouldn't buy me a car

51
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,197
<i>I recall Central Park in fall</i>

52
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,632
<i>how you tore your dress
what a mess, I confess...</i>

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,913
It's not that I condone fascism,
or any "ism"

54
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,877
A person should not believe in an
"ism", he should believe in himself

55
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,676
I quote John Lennon: "I don't believe
in Beatles I just believe in me"

56
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,475
A good point there
After all, he was the walrus

57
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,514
I could be the walrus,
I'd still have to bum rides off people

58
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,280

Bueller Bueller

He's sick My best friend's sister's
boyfriend's brother's girlfriend -

66
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,072
- saw Ferris pass out at 31 Flavours
last night I guess it's pretty serious

67
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,068
- Thank you, Simone
- No problem whatsoever

<i>- Hello?
- (FERRIS) Cameron, what's happening?</i>

71
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,149
<i>- Very little
- How do you feel?</i>

72
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,397
<i>- Shredded
- Is your mother in the room?</i>

73
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,309
She's in Decatur
Unfortunately she's not staying

74
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,632
- Where are you?
- I'm taking the day off, come on over

75
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,196
<i>- I can't, stupid, I'm sick.
- That's all in your head</i>

76
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,951
<i>- Come on over.
- I feel like shit I can't go anywhere</i>

77
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,871
I'm sorry to hear that
Now come on over and pick me up

78
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,630
I'm dying

79
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,990
<i>You're not dying. Youjust
can't think of anything good to do.</i>

80
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,912
Cameron really needs a day off

81
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,036
He has a lot of things to sort out
before he goes to college

82
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:42,112
<i>SINGS:
When Cameron was in Egypt's land</i>

83
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,393
<i>let my Cameron go.</i>

84
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,478
Cameron is so tight

85
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,752
that a lump of coal stuck up his ass
would turn into a diamond

86
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,636
<i>- Katie Bueller
- Edward Rooney, Dean of Students.</i>

87
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,870
I'm so sorry
I completely forgot to call

88
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,871
<i>- You know your son isn't in school?
- Yes. Ferris is home sick.</i>

89
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,473
<i>I had a meeting this morning.
I forgot to call. I'm very sorry.</i>

90
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,558
<i>Are you also aware -</i>

91
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,675
<i>- that Ferris does not have
an exemplary attendance record.</i>

92
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,279
<i>What?</i>

93
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,950
<i>He has missed an unacceptable
number of school days.</i>

94
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,789
<i>Ferris is not taking
his academic growth seriously.</i>

95
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,471
I've spent my morning
examining his records

96
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,233
If Ferris thinks he can coast through
to graduation, he is sorely mistaken

97
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,398
<i>I have no reservation whatsoever</i>

98
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,593
about holding him back
another year

99
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,032
- This is all news to me
- It usually is

100
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,554
- He has been absent nine times
- Nine times?

101
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,833
- Nine times
- He hasn't been sick nine times

102
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,114
That's probably because he
wasn't sick, he was skipping school

103
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,959
Wake up and smell the coffee

104
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,789
It's a fool's paradise He's leading
you down the primrose path

105
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,834
<i>- I can't believe it.
- It's right here in front of me</i>

106
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,270
He has missed nine days

107
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,752
I asked for a car I got a computer
How's that for being born unlucky?

108
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,113
Grace!

109
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,152
Mr Rooney, Ferris is home
and he is very ill

110
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,433
<i>- I debated even leaving him.
- Grace!</i>

111
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,269
At this time of year, children
are prone to taking the day off

112
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,678
But I can assure you
that Ferris is a very sick boy

113
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,713
Never had one lesson

114
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:24,675
In 1930 the House of Representatives,
in an effort to alleviate the effects of

115
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,438
Anyone?

116
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,192
The Great Depression
Passed the anyone?

117
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,598
The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act

118
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,712
Which raised or lowered?

119
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,358
<i>Raised tariffs in an effort to collect
more government revenue</i>

120
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,758
Did it work?
Anyone know the effects?

121
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,192
It did not work and the United States
sank deeper into the Depression

122
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,155
Today, we have a similar debate
over this Anyone know what this is?

123
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,239
Anyone seen this before?

124
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,159
The Laffer Curve
Anyone know what this says?

125
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,512
It says that at this point
on the revenue curve

126
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,589
you will get exactly the same
amount of revenue as at this point

127
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,794
Does anyone know
what Bush called this in 1980?

128
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,235
<i>Anyone? Something-doo economics
Voodoo economics</i>

129
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,276
Jeanie, I'm really sorry
about your brother

130
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,040
What are you sorry for?
I have to live with him

131
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,631
- I heard he's really sick
- Who said he's sick?

132
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,832
A bunch of people
say he's close to death

133
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,831
I heard that if Ferris dies,
he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder

134
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,635
He's such a sweetie Got to go

135
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,718
- Hi, Jeanie
- Shut up

136
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,912
How desperate is the situation?

137
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,793
Did you see "Alien"?

138
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,549
When the creature
was in that guy's stomach?

139
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,797
It feels like that
Freshman

140
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,710
- Are you kidding?
- Do I sound like I'm kidding?

141
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,595
- It's Ferris Bueller
- He got me out of summer school

142
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,590
<i>We appreciate you letting us
know how you're doing.</i>

143
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,395
I hope he doesn't die
I can't handle summer school

144
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,310
- Give me somebody else
- Sure, hold on

145
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,399
- Did you see "Alien"?
- Yeah, why?

146
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,637
Hello? Hi, Ferris, how's your bod?

147
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,072
You're dying?

148
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,353
- Is it serious?
- I hope not

149
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,270
- I may need a kidney transplant
- Shit! Are you upset?

150
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,308
- Excuse me
- Will you be alive this weekend?

151
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,479
- Yeah, I'd say so
- Great Maybe I'll see you

152
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,320
I don't trust this kid
any further than I can throw him

153
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:41,119
With your bad knee, Ed,
you shouldn't throw anybody It's true

154
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,758
What is so dangerous about him
is that he gives good kids bad ideas

155
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:53,718
The last thing I need is 1,500 Bueller
disciples running around these halls

156
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,390
He jeopardises my ability
to govern this student body

157
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,869
- He makes you look like an ass
- Thank you, but you're wrong

158
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,753
He's very popular

159
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,272
Sportoes, motorheads, geeks,
sluts, bloods, wasteoids, -

160
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,190
- dweebies, dickheads,
they all adore him

161
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,158
That is why I have got to catch him

162
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,070
To show these kids that his example
is a first-class ticket to nowhere

163
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,671
Ed! You sounded
like Dirty Harry just then

164
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,634
Really?

165
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,913
Thanks, Grace

166
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,513
<i>- You can't make me wait like this
- (CAMERON) Let me rot in peace.</i>

167
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,193
It's my ninth sick day If I get caught,
I won't graduate I'm doing this for you

168
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,439
- Do you know what my diastolic is?
- Take some Pepto Bismal

169
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,076
- Get dressed and come on over
- Shut up

170
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,674
Hold your water for a second
I've got another call Hello?

171
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,877
<i>- Ferris. You sound terrible.
- Darn, I thought I was improving.</i>

172
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,436
- Were you sleeping?
- Dad, can you hang on for a second?

173
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,473
- Sure, pal
- Hang on

174
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,275
- Cameron, it's my dad
- Great Keep me out of it

175
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,271
If you're not over here in 15 minutes,
you can find a new best friend

176
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,158
Dad, all this talking has made me
kind of light-headed

177
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,718
- I think I ought to lie down
- Wrap a hot towel round your head

178
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:50,429
- Wrap a hot towel round my head?
- Make some soup, then get a nap

179
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,872
- Ferris, I love you, pal
- I love you, too

180
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,397
I bet Cameron is sitting in his car
debating whether or not to go out

181
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,312
He'll keep calling me until I come over

182
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,432
He'll make me feel guilty

183
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,076
This is ridiculous I'll go I'll go

184
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,590
I'll go Shit!

185
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,997
Goddammit!

186
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,153
Forget it That's it

187
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,430
In what way

188
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:13,151
does the author's
use of the prison

189
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,837
symbolise

190
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,230
the protagonist's struggle?

191
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,716
And how does this relate

192
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,199
to our discussion
of the uses of irony?

193
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,315
Mr Nolan, may I interrupt, please?

194
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,035
Sloane Peterson,
may I have a word with you, dear?

195
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,360
I'm afraid that I am the bearer
of bad tidings

196
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,395
Your father called
Your grandmother has just passed

197
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,197
- No
- Oh, darling! Honey

198
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,916
- Dead grandmother?
- That's what Mr Peterson said

199
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,954
I had Florence Sparrow
notify the poor little lamb

200
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,109
- Who is this girl going out with?
- It's so hard to tell these days

201
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,916
I do see her with Ferris Bueller
quite a bit

202
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,272
Would you get me
Mr Peterson's daytime number?

203
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,672
<i>- Ed Rooney's Office
- This is George Peterson.</i>

204
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,431
Please hold
What do you know, it's Mr Peterson

205
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,837
Do you still want
his daytime number?

206
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,594
<i>- Ed Rooney
- Ed, this is George Peterson.</i>

207
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,510
<i>- How are you today, sir?
- Well, we've had a bit of bad luck.</i>

208
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,714
Yeah, I heard I'm all broken up
Boy, what a blow

209
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,629
<i>Yeah, it's been a tough morning.</i>

210
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,400
<i>We've got a lot of family business.</i>

211
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,229
<i>If you wouldn't mind excusing Sloane,
I'd appreciate it.</i>

212
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,079
Sure, I'd be happy to

213
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,592
You just produce a corpse,
and I'll release Sloane

214
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,395
I want to see this dead grandmother
first-hand

215
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,628
It's all right, it's Ferris Bueller
I'm setting a trap for him

216
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,912
<i>Ed, I'm sorry, did you say
you wanted to see a body?</i>

217
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,513
Yeah, roll her old bones over here
and I'll dig up your daughter

218
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,190
That's school policy
Was this your mother?

219
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,995
<i>No, my wife's mother.</i>

220
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,991
- Ed Rooney's Office
- This is Ferris Bueller for Mr Rooney

221
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,595
Hold

222
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,839
I'll tell you what, dipshit,
if you don't like my policies, -

223
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,511
- you can come down here
and smooch my big old white butt

224
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,396
- Pucker up, Buttercup What?
- Ferris Bueller is on line two

225
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,034
<i>Mr Rooney,
I'm not feeling very well today.</i>

226
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,189
Could my sister bring home
any assignments from my classes?

227
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,039
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

228
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,629
Mr Peterson
I think I owe you an apology

229
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,152
- I should say you do
- I

230
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,318
I think you should be sorry,
for Christ's sake

231
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,559
A family member dies and you
insult me! What's wrong with you?

232
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,639
Well I really don't know

233
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,037
<i>I didn't think I was talking to you.</i>

234
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,590
You know that I would never
deliberately insult you like that

235
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,635
Pardon my French,
but you're an asshole! Asshole!

236
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,595
You're absolutely right, sir
Find out where she is

237
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,112
- This isn't over yet Do you read me?
- Loud and clear, Mr Peterson

238
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,438
- Call me "sir", goddammit!
- Yes, sir

239
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,756
<i>That's better.</i>

240
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,078
You mind your P's and Q's,
and remember who you're dealing with

241
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,670
Bueller Ferris Bueller

242
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,032
I'm scared
What if he recognises my voice?

243
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,471
Impossible You're doing great

244
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,910
Rooney!
Rooney, calm down

245
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:25,674
- Just a moment
- Just a little office difficulty

246
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,238
I don't have all day to bark at you,
so I'm going to make this short

247
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,470
I want my daughter out
in front of the school by herself

248
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,433
- What?
- That's too suspicious

249
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,915
- Talk
- You!

250
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:50,509
- Talk!
- Rooney! Pay attention

251
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,555
I want you out there with her
I want a few words with you

252
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,475
We don't have time to talk right now
We'll get together over lunch

253
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,037
- What's wrong with you?
- Wait!

254
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,836
- Where's your brain?
- Why did you kick me?

255
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:19,479
How can we pick up Sloane
if Rooney is there with her?

256
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,196
I said for her to be there alone
and you freaked

257
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,397
I didn't hit you
I lightly slapped you

258
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,194
You hit me

259
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:40,469
Don't ask me to participate in your crap
if you don't like the way I do it

260
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,433
You make me get out of bed
and come here

261
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,031
You make me make a phoney call
to Edward Rooney

262
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,630
The man could squash my nuts

263
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,479
- And you deliberately hurt my feelings
- No

264
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:00,755
I did not deliberately
hurt your feelings I didn't

265
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,032
- What are you doing?
- See you later I'm going home

266
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,515
- Have a nice life
- Cameron, wait a minute

267
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:16,558
I didn't mean to lose my temper
I'm sorry, it was uncalled for

268
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,718
- Seriously?
- Yeah

269
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,794
- Here you go
- Thank you

270
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,878
You did screw up though, right?

271
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,713
- Not that it was completely your fault
- Why?

272
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,995
To fix the situation, I'm going
to have to ask you for a favour

273
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,070
The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California

274
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,200
Less than a hundred were made

275
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,359
My father spent
three years restoring this car

276
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,950
It is his love It is his passion

277
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,039
It is his fault
he didn't lock the garage

278
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,313
Ferris, what are you talking about?

279
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,749
My father loves this car more than life

280
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,751
A man with such priorities
doesn't deserve this fine automobile

281
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,311
No

282
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,275
Apparently you don't understand

283
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,315
He never drives it
He just rubs it with a diaper

284
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,150
Remember how insane he went
when I broke my retainer?

285
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,272
That was a piece of plastic
This is a Ferrari

286
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,433
We can't pick up Sloane in your car

287
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,518
Mr Rooney would never believe
Mr Peterson drives that piece of shit

288
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,838
- It's not a piece of shit
- It is

289
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,239
Don't worry I don't even have
a piece of shit I have to envy yours

290
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,594
I'm sorry
There's nothing else we can do

291
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,719
- He knows the mileage
- He doesn't trust you?

292
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,232
- Never has, never will
- This is real simple

293
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,989
Whatever miles we put on,
we'll take off

294
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,590
- We'll drive home backwards
- No

295
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:02,194
No, Ferris, forget it
I'm putting my foot down

296
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,155
How about we rent a nice Cadillac?
My treat

297
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,708
We could call a limo
A stretch job with a TV and a bar

298
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,438
Come on, live a little

299
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,079
Let me tell you how deeply saddened
I am by your loss

300
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,910
I had a grandmother once
Two, actually

301
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,515
"Man hath but a short time to live
and is full of misery"

302
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,156
"He cometh up
and is cut down like a flower"

303
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,477
"He fleeth as if it were a shadow -

304
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,877
- and never continueth in one stay"

305
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,595
Oh, dear

306
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,231
Between grief and nothing,
I'll take grief

307
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,469
Great

308
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,356
Sloane, dear, hurry along now

309
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,429
I guess that's my dad
I've got to go

310
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,999
Mr Rooney Ed

311
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,397
- You're a beautiful man
- Thank you

312
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,789
I want to thank you
for your warmth and compassion

313
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,750
Shit!

314
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,750
- Do you have a kiss for Daddy?
- Are you kidding?

315
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,958
So that's how it is in their family

316
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,192
- Hi, Cameron, are you comfortable?
- Hi, Sloane No

317
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,677
<i>- What are we going to do?
- What aren't we going to do?</i>

318
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,429
Don't say
we're not going to take the car home

319
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,760
If you had access to a car like this,
would you take it back right away?

320
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,474
Neither would I

321
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,235
Ferris, don't go so fast

322
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:11,957
ROCK MUSIC SOUNDTRACK

323
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,953
Save Ferris
God bless you You're very generous

324
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,993
Save Ferris Bueller

325
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,191
- Save Ferris?
- What?

326
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,758
We're collecting money
to buy Ferris Bueller a new kidney

327
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,838
- Go piss up a flagpole
- I'm sorry?

328
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,271
- You should be
- Hey!

329
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,393
What if you need a favour someday
from Ferris Bueller?

330
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,720
Peterson home on line one
Watch your mouth this time

331
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,276
Go suck your hat

332
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,430
<i>We can't come to the phone now.
We've had a death in the family.</i>

333
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,668
Ferris Bueller is behind this,
there is no doubt in my mind

334
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,759
- Now Sloane Peterson is involved
- Her grandmother, too

335
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,269
You pinhead

336
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,837
<i>If you need to reach us,
we'll be at the following number.</i>

337
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,674
I did not achieve my position by having
a punk leave my cheese in the wind

338
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,113
<i>You have reached
the Carlton Brothers Mortuary.</i>

339
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,472
<i>If you leave your name and number,
we'll get back to you.</i>

340
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,630
Something is going on,
and I'm going to find out what it is

341
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,753
I'm going to catch this kid
and put a dent in his future

342
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,875
15 years from now, when he looks back
on the ruin his life has become,

343
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,152
he will remember Edward Rooney

344
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,988
- Wrong
- What?

345
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,795
Not here
We're not leaving the car here

346
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,675
- Why not?
- I want the car home where it belongs

347
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,395
- Let's go
- What can happen in a garage?

348
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,118
It could get wrecked, stolen,
scratched, breathed on wrong

349
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,676
- A pigeon could shit on it
- Calm down

350
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,314
I'll give the guy a fiver to watch it

351
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,512
What guy?

352
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,717
Hey, how are you doing?
You speak English?

353
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,754
What country do you think this is?

354
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,750
Okay, I want you to take
extra special care of this vehicle

355
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,520
No problem Trust me

356
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,919
- Sir
- Come on

357
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,073
Relax

358
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,798
You have nothing to worry about
I'm a professional

359
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,231
A professional what?

360
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,436
See what a finski
can do to a guy's attitude?

361
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,155
Come on

362
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,630
Bless his little heart

363
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,029

- Ferris, you think the car's all right?
- Sure

366
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,199
- This is the world's tallest building
- I don't feel too good

367
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,828
Here, climb up on this

Come on, everybody Cameron

Okay, lean forward
against the glass like this

00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,752
- (SLOANE) Oh, my God!
- Isn't that great?

371
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,475
The city looks so peaceful
from up here

372
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,355
Anything is peaceful from 1,353 feet

373
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:40,238
- I think I see my dad
- We've got a lot to do Let's go

374
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,673
Shit! The son of a bitch
is down there somewhere

375
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,197
- You want to get married?
- Sure

376
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,675
Today? I'm serious

377
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,078
- I'm not getting married
- Why not?

378
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,831
- Think about it
- Besides being too young

379
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,634
Having no place to live

380
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,355
You being the only cheerleader
with a husband

381
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,190
- Give me one good reason why not?
- Look at my mother and father

382
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,994
- They hate each other
- So what?

383
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:46,116
It's like that car
He loves the car, he hates his wife

384
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,833
Thank you

385
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:14,949
Can we please get out of here?
This place gives me the creeps

386
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,273
Why didn't you tell me?

387
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,995
- Hello, may I help you?
- You can sure as hell try

388
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,672
I'm Abe Froman, party of three for 12

389
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,639
- Is there a problem?
- You're Abe Froman?

390
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:41,234
- The sausage king of Chicago?
- Yeah, that's me

391
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,675
I'm very busy Why don't you kids
go back to the clubhouse?

392
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,555
Are you suggesting
I'm not who I say I am?

393
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,834
I'm suggesting that you leave
before I have to get snooty

394
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,794
- Okay, Abe, let's go
- I'm not going anywhere

395
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,838
- No, we'd like to be seated
- I'm going to have to call the police

396
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,430
- You're going to call the police?
- Yes

397
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,838
- Fine! I'll call them myself
- Yes

398
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,318
Call the police This'll be a hoot

399
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,157
Give me the phone
I have another call

400
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,399
You touch me, I yell rat
Find another phone

401
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,036
Wonderful

402
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,199
I weep for the future

403
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,555
- Ferris, let it go
- Please, you've gone too far

404
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,752
You're going to get busted

405
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,193
You can never go too far,
and I won't be busted by a guy like that

406
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,439
- Come on, Abe!
- Ask for Abe Froman

407
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,872
<i>- Chez Quis?
- May I speak to Abe Froman?</i>

408
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:12,791
- The sausage king of Chicago
- Let me check the restaurant

409
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,595
- Could you describe him for me?
- Leatherjacket

410

<i>White T-shirt, sweater vest.</i>

411
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,272
Devastatingly handsome

412
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,268
<i>- Hold on one moment.
- Thank you</i>

413
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,715
<i>Froman, this is Sergeant Peterson,
Chicago Police.</i>

414
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,155
- I appreciate your understanding
- Don't think twice

415
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:54,595
Understanding allows people like us
to tolerate a person like yourself

416
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,038
- Thank you
- Don't mention it

417
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,070
Enjoy your luncheon

418
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,271
Darling, you were wonderful

419
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,677
Cameron, you thought we wouldn't
have any fun Shame on you

420
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,268
<i>JEANIE: I'm overreacting.
Maybe Ferris isn't such a bad guy.</i>

421
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,632
<i>After all, I got a car.
He got a computer.</i>

422
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:44,676
<i>Still, why should he get
to do whatever he wants?</i>

423
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,633
<i>Why should everything
work out for him?</i>

424
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,116
<i>What makes him
so goddam special?</i>

425
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,038
Screw him

426
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,152
<i>FERRIS: I used to think that my
family was the only one with weirdness.</i>

427
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:04,552
Then I saw Cameron's family
His home life is really twisted

428
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,469
That's why he's sick all the time
It really bothers him

429
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,116
He feels better when he's sick

430
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,075
If I had to live in that house,
I'd pray for a disease, too

431
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,195
The place is like a museum
It's very beautiful and very cold

432
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,198
You're not allowed to touch anything

433
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:30,713
Can you appreciate what it must
have been like to be there as a baby?

434
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:38,508
I'm amazed that I got the car out
I caught Cameron digging the ride

435
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,030
It's good for him
It teaches him to deal with his fear

436
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,073
Plus, I must be honest here

437
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,716
I love driving it It is so choice

438
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,869
If you have the means,
I highly recommend picking one up

439
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,117
- Thank you
- Yes, sir

440
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,988
Jeanie, who's bothering you now?

441
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,192
- Is Mr Rooney in?
- No, can I help you?

442
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,473
- I doubt it When is he back?
- I don't know

443
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:24,559
- He's out on personal business
- What's that supposed to mean?

444
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,799
I suppose it means
it's none of your business, young lady

445
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,754
Nice attitude

446
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,909
- Is Mrs Hagel expecting you in class?
- Probably

447

- Raise your advertising budget
- We don't have the money

449
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,996
If you want to sell, you have
to spend It's as simple as that

450
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,113
4,000 restaurants in the area
I pick the one my father goes to

451
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,595
We're pinched for sure

452
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,998
Only the meek get pinched
The bold survive Let's go

453

- Never

Dave, I'm telling you
that it's not the case

455
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:22,073
- We don't have the money
- Dave, you know what it takes

456
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:28,196
We're going to go heavy on TV
We'll lighten up on radio and print

457
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,278
Come on back to my office

458
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,836
We know you've got the money
We just have to spend it bonehead!

Nothing!
What do you mean, nothing good?

We've seen everything good,
we've seen the whole city

We went to a museum

Look over there

What?

510
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,317
- He didn't leave
- It really busts my hump

511
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,310
- He didn't ditch us
- He might be back at school

01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:50,594
How many miles did you say
this thing had on it when we left?

574
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:55,316
126 and halfway
between three and four tenths

575
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,753
Why? How many miles are on it now?

576
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,560
Here's where Cameron goes berserk

01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,432
Cameron, are you okay?

01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,916

01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,833
<i>- I could take a spill
down the stairs...</i>

583
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:50,751
God bless the police
I'm saved Thank you, God

584
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,829
<i>- Thank
- I heard that you were feeling ill</i>

585
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,998
<i>headache, fever and a chill</i>

586
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,078
<i>I came to help restore your pluck</i>

<i>'cause I'm the nurse who likes to...</i>

01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,110
This may very well be for real

589
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,869
He might have blown
a microchip or two

590
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:23,756
He's always been a little keyed up
I just wanted to give him a good day

591
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:27,191
We're going to graduate soon

592
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:32,428
We'll have the summer
He'll work and I'll work

593
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,950
We'll see each other at night
and on the weekends

594
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:39,789
Then he'll go to one school
and I'll go to another

595
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,549
Basically that will be it

596
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:48,231
Sloane's as big a problem

597
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:53,036
She has another year of high school
How do I deal with that?

598
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:57,074
I was serious
when I said I'd marry her I would

599
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,555
Cameron?

600
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,833
Can you hear me?

01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:08,591
Cameron, blink if you understand me

602
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,874
Cameron has never been in love
Well, nobody has been in love with him

603
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:19,916
If things don't change for him,
he's going to marry the first girl he lays

604
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:24,477
And she's going to treat him like shit,
because she will have given him

605
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:29,913
what he has built up in his mind as
the end all, be all of our existence

606
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,429
She won't respect him

607
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,634
You can't respect somebody who
kisses your ass It just doesn't work

608
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:43,790
Ferris, we'd better try something else
This isn't working

609
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:51,199
Are you feeling better, Cameron?

610
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:56,474
Why don't you come in here?
It's really nice

611
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:05,509
Cameron, I can flip out real easy, too
It's okay

612
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:10,236
Sooner or later,
everybody goes to the zoo

613
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:19,394
Maybe he's really sick
Maybe he isn't just torturing himself

614
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:05,559
Hey! Hey, Cameron!

615
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:10,515
Cameron, wake up

616
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:15,396
Come on, Cameron Wake up!

617
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:24,314
- What is that?
- Ferris Bueller, you're my hero

618
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:30,117
- That was pretty impressive, man
- You son of a bitch

619
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,428
It's not funny

620
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,910
Drugs?

621
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,078
Thank you, no I'm straight

622
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:14,558
I meant, are you in here for drugs?

623
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:18,116
- Why are you here?
- Drugs

624
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:22,598
- I don't know why I'm here
- Why don't you go home?

625
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,679
Why don't you
put your thumb up your butt?

626
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,914
You wear too much eye make-up

627
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,991
My sister wears too much
People think she's a whore

628
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:50,239
- You don't want to talk about it?
- With you? Are you serious?

629
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:53,716
- I'm serious
- Blow yourself

630
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:02,556
All right,
you want to know what's wrong?

631
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,992
I know what's wrong
I just want to hear you say it

632
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:10,272
In a nutshell, I hate my brother
How's that?

633
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:14,837
That's cool
Did you blow him away or something?

634
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:19,272
No, not yet

635
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:25,828
He was ditching school When I went
home to check, some guy was there

636
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,838
The cops picked me up
for making a phoney call

637
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,350
What do you care
if your brother ditches school?

638
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,473
- Everybody else has to go
- You could ditch

639
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:42,118
- I'd get caught
- Yes

640
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:46,996
You're pissed off because he ditches
and doesn't get caught, is that it?

641
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,080
- Basically
- Basically

642
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:56,149
- Your problem is you
- Excuse me?

643
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:01,434
Worry about yourself,
not about what your brother does

644
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:07,357
- That's just an opinion
- What are you, a psychiatrist?

645
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,916
Keep your opinions to yourself

646
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:18,311
There's somebody you should talk to

647
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,428
If you say Ferris Bueller,
you lose a testicle

648
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,756
Oh, you know him

649
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:39,348
That whole time
I was just thinking things over

650
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,836
I was like meditating

651
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:50,793
Then I sort of watched myself
from inside

652
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,516
I realised it was ridiculous
being afraid

653
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,554
Worrying about everything
Wishing I was dead

654
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,673
All that shit I'm tired of it

655
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:08,869
It was the best day of my life

656
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:15,310
I'm going to miss you guys next year

657
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,120
Cameron, can I ask you a question?

658
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,471
Yeah

659
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:36,231
Did you see me change
out of my clothes by the jacuzzi?

660
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,994
Did you?

661
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:46,639
You saw me?
I thought you were catatonic

662
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:53,310
That's okay I'm not embarrassed

663
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,877
I better check on the car

664
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,078
Hey, Ferris!

665
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,272
Yeah?

666
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:23,271
The miles aren't coming off
going in reverse

667
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:32,036
No
I thought that might be a problem

668
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:37,712
We have to open the odometer,
roll it back by hand

669
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,037
No, forget it

670
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,391
Forget it

671
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,629
I've got to take a stand

672
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:57,909
I'm bullshit

673
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:03,314
I put up with everything

674
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:09,992
My old man pushes me around

675
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:14,432
I never say anything

676
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,833
He's not the problem
I'm the problem

677
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,276
I've got to take a stand

678
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:34,109
I've got to take a stand against him

679
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,916
I am not going to sit on my ass

680
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:43,430
as the events that affect me unfold
to determine the course of my life

681
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:48,395
I'm going to take a stand and defend it

682
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:53,958
Right or wrong,
I'm going to defend it

683
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,392
I'm so sick of this shit

684
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:08,909
I can't stand him
and I hate this goddam car

685
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:13,193
Who do you love? You love a car

686
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,949
You son of a bitch

687
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,191
CAMERON: Shit

688
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,316
I dented the shit out of it

689
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:51,189
Good

690
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:57,032
My father will see what I did
I can't hide this

691
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:03,436
He'll come home
and he'll have to deal with me

692
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:06,518
I don't care I really don't

693
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:10,429
I'm just tired of being afraid

694
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,912
The hell with him

695
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:24,035
I can't wait to see the look
on his face

696
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,870
What did I do?

697
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:09,758
- What did I do?
- You killed the car

698
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,679
Whoa!

699
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:51,998
Holy shit!

700
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:08,439
It's my fault
I'll take the heat for it

701
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:14,431
When he comes home, we'll tell him
that I did it He hates me anyway

702
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,597
No, I'll take it

703
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:25,713
- I'll take it
- No, you don't want this much heat

704
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,639
If I didn't want it,
I wouldn't have let you take the car

705
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:35,632
- I made you take that car
- I could have stopped you

706
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,992
I want it
I'm going to take it, that's it

707
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:47,117
When Morris comes home,
he and I will just have a little chat

708
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:51,871
CAMERON: It's cool
No, it's going to be good

709
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:55,231
Thanks anyway

710
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:06,512
This is a shock to me
I don't know why she left school

711
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:10,872
And why would she come up
with a story about an intruder?

712
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:15,596
For whatever reason she did it,
she's had a scare

713
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:22,114
I appreciate you calling
We'll have a long talk with her at home

714
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,629
Thank you

715
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,150
- I hope your son is feeling better
- Pardon?

716
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:32,672
Tell him all the guys at the station
are pulling for him

717
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,235
Right

718
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,512
- Hi
- Don't "hi" me, young lady

719
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,631
I want to get out of here now
Now

720
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,072
Okay Fine!

721
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:04,716
- She's a little hyper
- Yeah

722
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:09,550
Let's not ruin this
with a lot of talk, okay?

723
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:15,278
- You didn't tell me your name
- It's Jean

724
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:18,756
But a lot of guys call me Shauna

725
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,748
- Okay, Jean
- Cool

726
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,474
That's great

727
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:29,389
I'll see you, okay?

728
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,634
MUM: Jeanie, now!

729
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:39,038
- Now!
- Okay

730
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:50,191
- I had a great time today
- Yeah, it was pretty cool

731
01:25:52,640 --> 01:25:55,393
Will Cameron be okay?

732
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,752
Yeah, sure,
for the first time in his life

733
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,235
He's going to be just fine

734
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:13,073
You knew what you were doing
when you woke up this morning

735
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,829
Me? No

736
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,879
Oh, shit!

737
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:39,878
I have to go

738
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,958
- I'll call you tonight
- Okay

739
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,399
- I love you
- I love you, too

740
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,354
He's going to marry me

741
01:26:55,240 --> 01:27:01,076
Do you know what it's like to pick up
your daughter at the police station?

742
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:07,196
I was about to close the deal
with the Vermont people

743
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:15,200
I was going to take my commission
and buy Ferris a car

744
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:19,791
What the hell are you doing?
Are you trying to kill us?

745
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,232
Look at this mess I'll never
get these papers back in order

746
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:45,032
- Slow down
- I can't drive with you yelling at me!

747
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,390
Hi, I'm Ferris Bueller

748
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:45,158
FERRIS: No, don't get up
That smells delicious

749
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,318
- (FERRIS) Dinner's ready
- What? Who was that?

750
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,035
What's wrong?

751
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:25,312
Everything I just picked up Jeanie
at the police station

752
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:33,195
She got a speeding ticket and I lost
the Vermont deal because of her

753
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:43,750
Looking for this?

754
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,632
I got you, Ferris

755
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:59,628
How's Ferris?
Let's go in and check on him

756
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:05,796
I have dreamed about this
And this time

757
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,552
you little bastard,
I've got you right where I want you

758
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:14,672
Ferris, we're home

759
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:22,719
How would you feel
about another year at high school?

760
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,516
Under my close,
personal supervision?

761
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:31,633
Hi

762
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:36,550
Thank God you're all right
We've been worried sick about you

763
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:44,358
Thank you, Mr Rooney,
for driving him home

764
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,599
Go upstairs and get in bed

765
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:00,595
Scoot!

766
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:05,999
Can you imagine someone that sick
trying to walk home from hospital?

767
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,430
Kids!

768
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:15,713
By the way, you left your wallet
on the kitchen floor

769
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:56,356
SNORING

770
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:20,554
Honey

771
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:24,548
- He's still awfully warm
- How do you feel?

772
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:28,196
150% better, thank you

773
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:34,475
Don't make me stay home again
I want to go to school

774
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:39,356
I have to graduate in June,
and I

775
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:44,588
Ferris, you're sick Don't push it
and make yourself worse

776
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:49,032
- Maybe you're right, Dad
- I know I'm right, pal

777
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:55,588
- How did you get to be so sweet?
- From years of practice

778
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:06,358
Blanket

779
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,196
Get well

780
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:27,073
I'm going to get myself settled,
then I'll bring you a hot cup of soup

781
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:42,074
I've said it before and I'll say
it again: Life moves pretty fast

782
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:46,751
If you don't stop and look around
once in a while, you could miss it

783
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:59,670
Four years I've been chasing this kid

784
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:04,874
Four years he's been
making a fool of me

785
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:18,159
Hey, Mr Rooney, what's going on?

786
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:22,551
Did you get in a fight?

787
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:25,991
Do you want a lift?

788
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:10,349
I bet you never smelled
a real school bus before

789
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:25,433
Gummi bear?

790
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:29,918
They've been in my pocket
They're real warm and soft

791
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:18,479
You're still here?

792
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:21,717
It's over

793
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,753
Go home

794
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,236
Go
