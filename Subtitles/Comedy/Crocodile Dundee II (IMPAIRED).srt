00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,644
But not here. Somewhere
I can see 'em coming.

639
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,854
What have you got in mind?

640
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:29,029
WALTER: You see, the Northern
Territory is wilderness.

641
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:36,456
Now, if any of you city folk
went out there and got lost,

642
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:40,874
you would last about three days.

643
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,333
Gosh!

644
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:47,297
And you mean you were out there alone
and wounded for 12 days, Mr. Reilly?

645
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:51,012
- Gator.
- No, I wasn't really alone, you see, I...

646
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,473
I had old Bessie.

647
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,805
And how is old Bessie, Gator?

648
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,816
Mick! You're back!

649
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,147
You're back!

650
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,354
- I missed you. I missed you.
- I know.

651
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,983
Sue! Sue Charlton.

652
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,444
Now, here's another one of
your fellow countrymen.

653
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,201
She's a brilliant New
York journalist.

654
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:21,369
She was the one that put Walkabout
Creek on the international scene.

655
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,254
Good to see you again, Gator.

656
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:28,925
- Mick! You old bastard!
- Donk! How are you?

657
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:32,258
G'day, mate! Bet you've got
some stories to tell, eh?

658
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,758
Have I ever, son. Have I ever.
But not on a dry throat.

659
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:38,643
- Ida?
- The drinks are on the house.

660
01:00:40,095 --> 01:00:41,768
That's a first!

661
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,476
So what were those New
Yorkers like, Mick?

662
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,779
They were a lot like us,
Nugget. A lot like us.

663
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:52,779
In fact, I saw Donk's twin
brother over there, in New York,

664
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:54,075
in the Bronx Zoo.

665
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,074
- I don't have a brother.
- (LAUGHTER)

666
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,363
In a cage, Donk!

667
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:03,161
- He's still quick, eh?
- Nothing's changed.

668
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,624
Son of a bitch!

669
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,547
What's stopping you?

670
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,335
- Hey, what's stopping you?
- Donk!

671
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,809
- Cheers, Mick!
- Great to see you, again.

672
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,516
Luis.

673
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,692
Jefe.

674
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,231
It's like they jumped off
the face of the planet.

675
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,819
Nobody knows nothing,
not even the Feds.

676
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,950
Somebody knows.

677
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:43,625
Double the price.
The girl's got to die.

678
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:48,335
But no one touches
Dundee. He's for me.

679
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:42,514
Mick, this area we're in now,
does it have a name?

680
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:45,516
Billongamick.

681
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,854
Billongamick. Does
that mean something?

682
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:52,728
Mick's Place.

683
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,944
Okay, why does it mean that?

684
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:01,028
- Hmm. 'Cause I own it, I guess.
- You own it?

685
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:05,244
Yeah, an uncle of mine
left it to me years ago.

686
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,326
How big is Mick's Place?

687
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:13,123
It's not very big. You could walk
across it in three or four days.

688
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:19,721
Three or four days! You can walk
across New York State in two!

689
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,512
Yeah, but this is the Territory.

690
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,515
I mean, anything under 1,000 square
miles up here is a hobby farm.

691
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:31,020
And Mick's Place, it's all
swamps and rocky mountains.

692
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:34,687
The only thing you can raise
around here are mosquitoes.

693
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:39,115
Well, I don't care if it is worthless.
I'm glad it's yours, I love it.

694
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:46,244
I wouldn't say it's worthless. It does
have some redeeming features.

695
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:55,256
Is this what I think it is?

696
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,759
Tomorrow, when we go
up to my weekender,

697
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,757
I'll show you the Reserve Bank.

698
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,974
That's what I call my mine.
It's like my retirement fund.

699
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:47,967

01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,310
Hey, Miguel!

701
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,984
It's been a long time, amigo.

702
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:00,480
(LAUGHS)

703
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,368
You look good, Frank.

704
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,992
This is Mr. Rico.
He pays the bills.

705
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:10,369
How're you doin'?

706
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:14,795
That's Denning. And
Erskine in the truck.

707
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,374
They're good men.

708
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,721
You didn't have to bring
in extra help, Mr. Rico.

709
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:26,969
Me and my guys can
take care of Dundee.

710
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,601
- You know him?
- I heard of him.

711
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:36,521
Oh. That's Teddy. He's a tracker.

712
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:39,731
Dundee went bush about a week ago

713
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:42,405
and Teddy's the fella that's
gonna help us find him.

714
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,654
The fella you're looking for,
would that be Mick Dundee?

715
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,451
Yeah, so what?

716
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,872
For you.

717
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,049
Where's he going?

718
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,964
I don't know.

719
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,049
Denning, bring him back!

720
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,599
Come back!

721
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,489
He's gone!

722
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,159
Shit!

723
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,208
This holds us up, no?

724
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:41,373
Nah. No worries, Mr. Rico.

725
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:44,380
Maybe just a day or two till
we pick us up another tracker.

726
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,381
What?

727
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:53,472
There's a quicker way.

01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:37,599
Yeah.

731
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,985
- View's pretty good.
- Yeah, it's not bad.

732
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:51,071
Probably double the
value of this place.

733
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,487
That'd be $200,

734
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:57,369
$300, minimum.

735
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:01,662
Well, you're the only one
I've ever brought here.

736
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:21,769
I'm so lucky to have
a rich man like you.

737
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:39,532
What is it?

738
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,795

Yeah. It was all I could
think of to save his life.

Well, of course, you see...

01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:28,770
That's his backyard, up there.

this place better.

01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:00,945
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

963
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,908
No, mate. We just hold them.

964
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:08,791
What did he say?

965
01:35:10,663 --> 01:35:13,132
He wants to know if we're
allowed to eat these men.

966
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:15,710
(GROANS)

967
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:38,366
We made the right decision,
mate. Stuff the money.

968
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:42,325
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I've had
a bad feeling about this

969
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:44,656
ever since that old black
tracker walked off.

970
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:45,782
(LAUGHS)

971
01:35:46,032 --> 01:35:49,912
You know, I thought that greaser
really did turn into a goanna.

972
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:54,958
Erskine?

973
01:35:58,461 --> 01:35:59,883
Erskine?

974
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:05,434
Don't fool around.

975
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,012
Erskine!

976
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:31,836
He's headed for Jaba
Point, that's for sure.

977
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:35,419
We cross here. You lead the
way, amigo, we'll cover you.

978
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:37,925
Yeah.

979
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:56,561
(SCREAMS)

980
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:22,045
We don't need him now, anyway.

981
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:24,805
He's already shown us
the way to Jaba Point.

982
01:37:28,718 --> 01:37:30,595
We'll cross over here.

983
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:43,775
(GASPS)

984
01:37:45,777 --> 01:37:46,778
(LAUGHS)

985
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:48,784
I knew it was you all the time.

986
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:52,701
First you shoot my head,
now you try to drown me.

987
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:55,958
- You've been hit.
- It's only a scratch, mate.

988
01:37:57,497 --> 01:37:58,937
Listen, don't put
that in the water,

989
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:00,676
'cause there might be
real crocs down there.

990
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:02,676
Where do you think
I got this fella?

991
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:05,258
In here.

992
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:12,186
- Should have seen your face, Wal.
- What was the matter with it?

993
01:38:12,345 --> 01:38:13,813
- You shit yourself.
- I did not!

994
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,231
- Yes, you did.
- No, I did not.

995
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:17,729
- You didn't know it was me.
- Yeah, I did!

996
01:38:34,659 --> 01:38:36,377
G'day. Want a cold one?

997
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:39,873
- Who the hell are you?
- Call me Nugget.

998
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:41,771
I've been looking
for Walter Reilly.

999
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:46,012
Haven't seen him around, have you?

1000
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:49,712
You should have brought a
gun instead of beer, mate.

1001
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:54,392
Nah, I don't need a
gun. I've got a Donk.

1002
01:38:56,347 --> 01:38:57,348
(LAUGHS)

1003
01:38:59,058 --> 01:39:00,776
You've got a what?

1004
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:04,526
Donk.

1005
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:06,190
(GRUNTS)

1006
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:27,712
Walter! Over here!

1007
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:33,601
There you are! I was just making
sure that nobody followed me.

1008
01:39:33,759 --> 01:39:37,229
- How'd you get away?
- Well, it was a piece of cake really.

1009
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:42,064
It was just a question of timing,
'cause Mick and I had this plan.

1010
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,611
- You've been shot again.
- No, that's Mick's.

1011
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,397
- What?
- No...(CHUCKLES)

1012
01:39:46,481 --> 01:39:48,529
He's all right.
It's just a scratch.

1013
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,655
Where is he?

1014
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:53,455
He's leading those other two
mongrels up to Jaba Point.

1015
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:55,531
That's mountain goat country,

1016
01:39:55,615 --> 01:40:00,416
so he's gonna have a
picnic with those two!

1017
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:05,963
Sue, what are you doing?
Mick told us to wait here.

1018
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:09,512
Mick thinks this is some big game.
Rico didn't come here for a picnic.

1019
01:40:09,587 --> 01:40:10,679
Which way is it?

1020
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:17,095
Well, I'll have to go with you.

1021
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:31,944
Are you really enjoying that?

1022
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:36,580
Nah. Needs garlic.

1023
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:00,471
(THUDDING)

1024
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:04,817
(GUNSHOTS)

1025
01:41:16,362 --> 01:41:19,536
It's time we stopped playing
this bushman's game his way.

1026
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:22,498
What do you mean?

1027
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:28,841
This man can take us
anytime he wants to.

1028
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,044
No.

1029
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:34,513
Now we finish it.

1030
01:41:35,506 --> 01:41:38,510
Think! When we were children,

1031
01:41:39,468 --> 01:41:42,062
did you chase a snake
into the cane fields?

1032
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:49,024
Move to those rocks and wait.

1033
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:53,250
(COUGHS)

1034
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:57,263
(COUGHING)

1035
01:43:07,807 --> 01:43:08,808
(COUGHS)

1036
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:54,145
G'day, <i>amigo</i>.

1037
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:06,328
Take your pants off.

1038
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:52,286
SUE: He's got Mick!

1039
01:44:56,874 --> 01:44:57,875
(GUNSHOT)

1040
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:08,511
(GUNSHOT)

1041
01:45:11,347 --> 01:45:12,348
(GUNSHOT)

1042
01:45:15,684 --> 01:45:17,186
Mick. (GASPS)

1043
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:25,653
(GASPS)

1044
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,693
If Mick want his clothes back,

1045
01:45:57,768 --> 01:46:00,396
he can climb down there and
get it his bloody self.

1046
01:46:02,857 --> 01:46:04,074
What?

1047
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:10,159
Mick's clothes.

1048
01:46:11,407 --> 01:46:15,287
We swapped it with that bastard,
so we can flush the other fella out.

1049
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:17,955
Plan was working till you
turned up and shot Mick.

1050
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,927
That's not Mick?

1051
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:34,605
'Course not.
There's Mick over there.

1052
01:46:41,145 --> 01:46:42,146
(GASPS)

1053
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:06,796
Mick's bloody lucky you
can't shoot straight, Wal.

1054
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:17,772
You ready to go home now?

1055
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:19,270
I am home.
