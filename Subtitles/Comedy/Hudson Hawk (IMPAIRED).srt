00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:32,491
Long ago, the duke of Milan
commissioned a little-known artist

2
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:36,379
...to erect a mammoth statue
of a horse.

3
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,924
The time was 1481.

4
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,678
The artist was Leonardo da Vinci.

5
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:48,306
The guy on the donkey
is just a guy on a donkey.

6
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:53,062
Anyway, they called this statue
the Sforza...

7
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,397
...and it was gonna be
the largest bronze statue ever built.

8
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,981
But wouldn't you know it...

9
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:04,193
...war broke out,
and bronze became scarce.

10
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:07,451
So da Vinci decided
to create a machine...

11
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,239
...to change common lead
into bronze.

12
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,500
But when da Vinci
finally turned this machine on...

13
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,960
...it was to give him something
more than he expected.

14
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,295
Something much more than bronze.

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,510
Leonardo, che pazzo!

...an artiste of a different field--

32
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,054
The one of cat burglary.

33
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,262
--Was getting out of Sing Sing.

34
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,474
He was known
<i>as</i> the Hudson Hawk.

35
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,899
Got a coat, hat.

36
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,855
Here's your personal items.

37
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,861
Here's your wallet.

38
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,239
I think you'll find
everything in there.

39
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,195
Don't you want your receipt?

40
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,984
Keep it. Ready?

41
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,903
I got it, Charlie.

42
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,117
Eddie. Eddie.

43
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,658
So the Hudson Hawk is
finally getting out.

44
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,247
Remember all the reporters
that here when you came in?

45
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,128
"World's greatest cat burglar."

46
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,164
Now who gives a fuck?

47
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,583
I got a proposition for you.

48
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,467
Answer's no, Gates.
Even if you bathe.

49
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,470
Listen, smartass, as your
parole officer, I found you a job.

50
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:04,179
- No way.
- It's a terrific job. An auction house.

51
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,093
One night's work, and you're free.

52
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,433
No checking in with <i>a</i> shrink.
No more community service.

53
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,598
But I want to do
community service.

54
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,109
I want to teach the handicapped
how to yodel.

55
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,941
I ain't stealing no more, Gates.

56
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,572
Ten years later, you're still
impressed with yourself.

57
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,110
Same old coat, same old hat.
You're extinct, Hawk.

58
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,370
Coming from you,
that's a powerful statement.

59
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,405
Look, aren't you supposed to stop me
from committing crimes.

60
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,416
You know, "Book 'em, Danno."
"Give a hoot, don't pollute."

61
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,794
You ain't out yet, wise guy.

62
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,457
I can set you up and send you back
any time I want.

63
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:42,847
It's a very fine line
between ex-con and escaped con.

64
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,099
Hey, Gates, do it yourself.

65
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,182
Hey! He's got my keys!

66
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:50,721
I'll be seeing you, Hawk!

67
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,271
Open the gate!

68
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,367
- See you around, Mike.
- Take it easy, Eddie.

69
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,884
That's the first thing I did:

70
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,970
Smooch the ground
and taste the freedom.

71
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,135
Sorry I'm late, Eddie.
I miss anything?

72
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,929
As always,
your timing is impeccable.

73
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,685
- Where's the kiss?
- Get away from me.

74
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,946
No tongue this time, I promise.

75
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,356
Whoa.

76
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,617
What?

77
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,824
- Looks like you been expanding your--
- Don't say it, Eddie!

78
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,365
I'm incredibly sensitive
about my fucking figure.

79
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,001
My next word was gonna be
“consciousness"...

80
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,628
...tubbo.

81
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,375
You're free, you son of a bitch!

82
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,843
Now that you're born again,
what do you wanna do?

83
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,304
Statue of Liberty?
Entertain some ladies?

84
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,344
Broadway tix?
Seduce some women?

85
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,480
Play Nintendo?
Bone some chicks?

86
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,647
What's Nintendo?

87
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,857
Just get me to
the Five Tone, Tommy.

88
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,364
I don't get a cappuccino soon,
I'll strangle somebody.

89
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,571
You still got a thing for those
unmasculine European coffees?

90
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,204
- What can I say?
- Who's your buddy?

91
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,367
The man knows! The man knows!

92
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,207
So, Mr. Coffee, you have
any trouble checking out?

93
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,416
Not much.

94
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,879
Gates just tried to blackmail me
into doing a job.

95
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,135
That doughnut-hole-eating,
son of a bitch...

96
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,763
...take-it-in-the-ear-for-a-beer
rat bastard!

97
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,720
Had the perfect amount of foam.

98
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,510
Come on, I'll get you 10 of them
back at the bar.

99
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,099
An auction house? Gates wants you
to rob an auction house?

100
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,730
Yes, an auction house.
What are you, going deaf?

101
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,439
He's your parole officer, for Christ's sake.
And, look, I am not going deaf.

102
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,649
Tommy, just get me
in the Five Tone.

103
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,189
Yeah, all right.

104
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,733
"Going deaf."
Don't make fun of my hearing, right?

105
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,698
Tell you something about the bar.
You're gonna love it.

106
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,908
Five Tone Bar and Grill.

107
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:17,076
At least I know there's one thing
that will never cha--

108
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,744
I don't know how
to tell you this, Eddie.

109
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,538
Couple of brokers stopped in
for Stoli spritzers one night.

110
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,504
Now we're a nice local bar
that none of the locals can afford.

111
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,261
I read about these people
in Newsweek.

112
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,966
Where's all the regulars?

113
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,349
- Where's Crazy Jeff Cava?
- Gone.

114
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,805
- Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?
- Gone, Eddie.

115
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,312
Tommy, you took down
Captain Bob's steering wheel?

116
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,723
Eddie, Eddie, they're all gone.

117
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,812
But look at the bright side:

118
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,228
Half this joint is yours.

119
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:47,398
Hey, Blackjack! Give my
irritable partner a cappuccino.

120
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,066
I gotta go be a boss.

121
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,030
Give me a Scotch and water.
Thanks.

122
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:56,369
- Reindeer goat cheese pizza?!
- Yo!

123
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,125
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you.

124
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,684
Cute shot, Antony.

125
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,569
Cesar Mario. Antony Mario.

126
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,355
I didn't know the circus
was in town.

127
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,899
So why won't you do
the auction house?

128
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,363
Well, call me superstitious, Cesar.

129
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,201
I don't like to commit a crime
within 24 hours of getting out of the joint.

130
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,333
It's very simple.
There's a safe on the seventh ﬂoor.

131
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,960
You take their thingy
and you put it in this thingy.

132
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,962
Directions even your brother
could understand.

133
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,998
Yeah, directions
even I could understand.

134
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,758
Shut up.

135
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,794
Hawk, you're the best.

136
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,930
You're the only one who can
do this job. You know that.

137
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,432
Don't tell me a lot of horse shit,
you wanna open up a hardware store...

138
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,719
...go straight and sell spatulas.

139
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,810
You know Cesar, if the Mario brothers weren't
New Jersey's third-largest crime family...

140
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,770
...I'd say kiss my ass.

141
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,062
But considering your status,
I will say slurp my butt.

142
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,275
- Sit.
- Sit.

143
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,405
Have you lovely ladies
tried our house wine?

144
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,612
- I think you'll enjoy.
- Beat it, Tommy.

145
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,527
No dinosaurs allowed.

146
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,695
Enough!

147
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,461
You don't do that auction house job,
I'm gonna put you on trial...

148
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,212
...and I promise you, my friend...

149
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,123
...there will be no bailiff.

150
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,633
You understand?

151
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,169
Get him out of here.

152
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,485
-"Witchcraft."
- Three minutes, 57 seconds.

153
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,321
-"Night and Day"?
- Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald?

154
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,032
- Sinatra.
- Five minutes, 12 seconds.

155
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,662
"Hit the Road, Jack."

156
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,869
Tommy, where are my
needle-nose pliers?

157
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,625
Check the bar. "Hit the Road, Jack."

158
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,880
Five minutes, 15 seconds.

159
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,918
How the hell could you take this down, man?
Captain Bob's steering wheel?

160
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,212
Don't you remember the night he came in?
Nobody could figure out where he got this thing.

161
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,096
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

162
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:20,054
- Yes?
- Quiet. Come here.

163
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,436
We got a nasty little safe
on the seventh ﬂoor here.

164
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,596
- Simpson?
- Yeah.

165
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,516
- What's the mechanism?
- Seventy-one.

166
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,027
Last time I went to bat,
Simpson only made a 40.

167
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,189
So it's gonna take you another
extra 31 seconds to seduce it.

168
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,357
- I'm not worried about the safe, Tommy.
- I know you're not worried about it.

169
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,650
What about these guards?
We know any of these guys?

170
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,864
No.

171
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,119
- Not one?
- Not one. No.

172
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,872
- Well, what about the video surveillance?
- I have a plan.

173
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,954
- Oh, you got a plan.
- I have a great plan.

174
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:49,337
Great.

175
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,748
What the hell am I doing?

176
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,134
Huh? What the hell am I doing?
I'm getting ready to do some crime.

177
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,545
Go rob some fakakta horse
with you?

178
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,837
All right, Eddie--

179
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,677
I should be out there
getting myself a Daily News,

180
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,308
looking in the "Want Ads“
trying to get a job selling spatulas.

181
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,889
We're moving too fast, Eddie.

182
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,852
You see, I'm putting out a fire
with kerosene.

183
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,439
- What is that?
- That's five seconds. My record's 18.

184
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,648
Is this funny?

185
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,859
You think this is
some kind of fucking joke?

186
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,175
- How many seconds?
- How many what seconds?

187
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,710
On the thumbcuffs.

188
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:41,006
Not counting the bitching and whining,
I'll be nice and say eight.

189
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:45,769
You know, they're not gonna let you
walk away from this job, kiddo.

190
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,272
I ain't never gonna get
rehabilitated this way, Tommy.

191
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,103
You think you still got it, Eddie?

192
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,484
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.

193
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,988
-"Mack the Knife"?
- Four minutes, 17 seconds.

194
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,819
"I Only Have Eyes for You."

195
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,654
Why, Tommy,
I didn't know you cared.

196
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,114
Three minutes, <i>22</i> seconds.

197
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,074
-"Xanadu."
-"Xanadu"?

198
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,706
-"Xanadu.“
- Four minutes, 19 seconds.

199
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,834
"Star-spangled Banner."
Whitney Houston, Super Bowl XVII.

200
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,619
- Hi.
- Hi, Hank.

201
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,915
- Seven minutes, 17 seconds.
- You're full of shit.

202
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,424
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

203
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,425
How come I'm not out
trying to get laid tonight?

204
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,131
Eddie, you're bumming my high.

205
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,796
Come on. It's show time.

206
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,258
Tommy, hold on. Hold on a minute.

207
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,473
The sign here says
"no horseplay in the pool area."

208
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,932
This isn't horseplay.

209
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,439
This is a major felony.

210
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:07,677
Come on, Grandpa.

211
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,640
- Hey, Tommy.
- What?

212
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,475
Give me one good reason
why we're up here.

213
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,232
I can give you two:
Antony Mario and Cesar Mario.

214
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,688
Well, you don't really think
that they're gonna--

215
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,853
Cut off our balls
if we don't do the job.

216
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,397
I see.

217
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,689
- Let me ask you something else.
- What?!

218
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:22,982
- Did you have dinner tonight?
- Why?

219
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,277
Because this rope only holds
900 pounds.

220
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,912
- Eddie, stop fooling around!
- I'm not fooling around.

221
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,118
You are! You're fooling around!

222
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,251
- Pick me up. Pick me up.
- All right, all right.

223
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,537
- Come on.
- I wish you'd lay off the pasta.

224
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,302
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

225
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,013
Covering our tracks.
We leave through the basement.

226
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,177
Well, now we have
no choice, do we?

227
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,566
- What?
- I better make the hole a little bigger.

228
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,531
Don't worry, bonehead.
I'm wearing my girdle.

229
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,811
Six hundred and seventy-three Wongs
in the phone book.

230
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,230
That's a hell of <i>a</i> lot of "Wong" numbers.

231
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,398
Look up "Chin."

232
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,339
That's it.

233
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,341
- You got a key?
- No.

234
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,047
Just checking.

235
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,070
They record everything
video surveillance takes in.

236
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,327
Yes, I can see that, master thief.

237
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,657
I thought you
said something about a plan.

238
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,744
Oh, am I boring you, smartass?

239
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,409
Hey, Jerry, check out Big Stan.

240
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,294
Watch this.

241
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,716
Big Stan!

242
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,927
Now watch.
A little rewind and replay...

243
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,970
...and the guards are gonna be
watching a rerun...

244
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,811
...and they're gonna miss out
on tonight's exciting episode.

245
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,691
- You figure this out by yourself?
- Yeah.

246
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,942
Good plan, junior.

247
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:07,822
We got about five minutes
and change.

248
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,948

251

I didn't wanna do it.
All I wanted was a cappuccino.

check out screen two.

00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,492
I'm not as fat <i>as</i> that guard, am I?

311
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,954
Oh, no. You're a slender reed
compared to that guard.

312
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,587
Come on, Slim Jim.

313
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,893
Hudson Hawk gets
the chair of honor.

314
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,474
Good job. Not pretty, but good.

315
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,358
All this trouble for a horsey.

316
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:16,771
I may not know art,
but I know what I like.

317
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,564
- You certainly do.
- So...

318
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:23,453
...when's this Sebastian Cabot Buckingham Palace-looking,
butler-head motherfucker getting here?

319
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:26,660
Any minute now, dear Mr. Gates.

320
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,339
- Sorry, Jeeves.
- May I?

321
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,010
Exquisite.

322
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:45,300
Leonardo da Vinci's last commission
for the duke of Milan.

323
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,139
Irreplaceable.

324
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:50,851
Hey, Mr. French. I'm--

325
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,856
What the...? What...?

326
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,602
Ah, yes

327
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,861
You son of a bitch.

328
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,445
I stuck my neck out setting this up
for you limey bastards.

329
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,826
Now, where's my cut?

330
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,878
So much for his cut.

331
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,044
Forgive my dry British humor.

332
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:23,421
You know, I think Gates
promised Hawk a cut too.

333
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,230
Lovely work, Alfred.
You taking the Concorde back?

334
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,437
Always, Mr. Mario.

335
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:41,732
I'm really racking up
those frequent-ﬂier points.

336
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,821
Ta-ta, Hudson Hawk.

337
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:48,738
Yo, Five-Tone.

338
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,781
Did I miss anything?

339
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:54,418
Gates tries to blackmail me.
You ask me, "Did I miss anything?"

340
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,748
Gates gets killed.

341
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,754
You say, "Did I miss anything?"

342
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,335
I bet you'd go up to
Mrs. Lincoln at the Ford Theatre:

343
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,593
and say, "How was the show?
Did I miss anything?“

344
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,060
- You may wanna get this looked at.
- Jeez, Gates was killed?

345
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,936
So who do we send
a thank-you note to?

346
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,221
The butler did it.

347
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,062
Guy was a cross between
Alistair Cooke and a Cuisinart.

348
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,398
Took Mr. Ed, Humpty-Dumptied it
over Gates' head, and get this:

349
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:24,657
- He said it was made by Leonardo--
- Da Vinci's Sforza.

350
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,032
I consider it to be the prize...

351
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,617
...of tonight's auction
of objets d'equestrian.

352
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,372
Horse things.

353
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,954
All right, Mr. PBS, you got me.

354
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,414
Morning edition.

355
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:39,922
It says here, two thieves
attempted to steal it last night...

356
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,300
...but thanks to three brave guards,
it will be ready for tonight.

357
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,881
Attempted?

358
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:49,299
I didn't wanna steal the goddamned
thing in the first place, but I do have my pride.

359
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,808
I don't understand this.

360
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,593
Why try? Forget about it.

361
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,559
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.
Cops, Mafia...

362
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:59,021
...butlers forcing me to steal something
which now it appears I didn't steal after all.

363
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:02,858
It's all too goddamn
peculiar, Tommy.

364
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,237
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

365
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,898
How much does a new tuxedo cost?

366
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,740
A fantastic example
of Florentine bronze.

367
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:14,624
Now, who will start at 140,000?

368
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,500
Hundred-and-forty thousand.

369
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,080
Hundred-and-sixty thousand?

370
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,747
Seventy? Eighty? Ninety thousand.

371
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,167
Two hundred'?

372
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,711
Twenty.

373
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:31,428
Forty.

374
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,594
Two-hundred-and-fifty thousand.

375
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,435
Two-hundred-and-fifty thousand?
Sixty thousand?

376
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,725
Seventy? Eighty?

377
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:44,646
Ninety? Three hundred thousand.
Three-ten.

378
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:45,984
Sold.

379
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,069
You know, after all these years...

380
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,236
...I still get goose bumps
coming to these auctions.

381
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:54,826
The paintings, the sculptures...

382
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,366
Things that aren't really
paintings or sculptures.

383
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:01,254
Pretentious vultures who never look up from their
calculators to see what they're buying.

384
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,290
Now, that gives me goose bumps.

385
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,958
Auctions are disgusting.

386
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,593
I couldn't agree more.

387
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,628
Savages.

388
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:12,844
Now, lot 15.

389
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:18,103
An equestrian piece
attributed to the Trillini school.

390
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:21,766
Now, who will start at 250,000?

391
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,355
Two-hundred-fifty thousand.
Eighty thousand.

392
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,191
Thank you, sir.

393
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,481
Three hundred thousand.
Three-twenty.

394
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,321
Three-forty thousand.

395
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,906
No more on 340,000'?

396
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,039
Sold once. Twice.

397
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,915
Sold.

398
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:43,204
And finally, lot number 17.

399
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:49,298
Thought to be lost in the war,
and again last night.

400
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:54,306
The da Vinci Sforza,
the jewel of the sale.

401
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,841
Fantastic.

402
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,851
Is looking like
a constipated warthog...

403
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,684
<i>...a</i> prerequisite for getting a job
in the art world?

404
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:05,397
--Doctoressa Anna Baragli
of the Vatican. Doc?

405
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,529
Some of us warthogs are
more constipated than others.

406
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,633
Oh, shit.

407
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,931
Perfection.

408
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:40,060
The Vatican extends its jealousy
to the lucky bidder.

409
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,846
Thank you, doctor.

410
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:47,485
We'll begin the bidding
at $20 million. To you, sir.

411
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,817
- Twenty-point-five
- Waldo!

412
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,324
One hundred million clams.

413
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:59,205
That's $100 million
to Mr. Darwin Mayflower.

414
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:07,046
One hundred million and one, Waldo.

415
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,047
Fantastic.

416
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,585
One hundred million dollars
and one.

417
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,173
Outbid by mine own wench.

418
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:15,588
Quelle bummer.

419
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,974
Don't hate me, baby.

420
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,470
- Bunny.
- Bunny.

421
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,480
Any other bids?

422
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,186
Going once.

423
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:40,121
Going twice.

424
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,622
Gone.

425
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,684
My God. That was bold of you.

426
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,941
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's nothing.

427
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,476
Anybody would have
done the same thing.

428
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,236
No, I mean, you didn't
have to tackle me and rip my dress.

429
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,647
Oh.

430
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,488
Oh, I'm just kidding.
Thanks for saving me, tough guy.

431
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,947
Why was that guard
chasing you?

432
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,737
Because danger, doc,
is my middle--

433
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,593
Couldn't just play along,
could you, Eddie?

434
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:44,511
You gotta admit, Eddie. Classy way
of covering our tracks, huh?

435
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,601
That auctioneer ought to be landing
at La Guardia any minute now.

436
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,601
Hey, subtlety's not one
of our strong points.

437
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,622
Get the fuck out of here.

438
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,326
You stupid ass!

439
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,132
- Ew, menthol.
- Hey!

440
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,349
This is a brand-new tuxedo!

441
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,262
Hey, mister. Are you gonna die?

442
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,022
Happy sailing, Hawk!

443
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,486
No! Oh, no!

444
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:41,775
How am I driving?

445
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,411
1-800-I'm-gonna-fucking-die!

446
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,623
Toll booth?!

447
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,254
Exact change?!

448
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,097
Make him roadkill.

449
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,607
Up yours, Cesar.

450
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,688
Yeah, run him down.

451
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:33,623
Cesar! Antony!

452
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,037
Are you okay?

453
00:32:58,435 --> 00:32:59,778
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

454
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,780
The name's Snickers.
The plane leaves in 40.

455
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,865
Almond Joy. Get it? Candy bars.

456
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,664
Well, it's better
than when we first started out.

457
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,495
Our code names were diseases.

458
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,002
Do you know what it's like
being called Chlamydia for a year?

459
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,958
Oops, forgot.

460
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,097
- My's Butterfinger.
- No shit.

461
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,900
Do you like
the company's new look?

462
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,236
I call them the "MTV-IA."

463
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,524
George, you promised.

464
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,695
No old-CIA/new-CIA jokes

465
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,786
Punks. They think the Bay of Pigs
is an herbal tea...

466
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,623
...and the Cold War has something
to do with penguins.

467
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,002
Don't I know you?

468
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,711
The last time you saw me, I was bald
with a beard and no mustache...

469
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,841
...and I had a different nose.

470
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,799
So if you don't recognize me,
I won't be offended.

471
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,181
My high school science teacher?

472
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:13,098
I'm the guy who tricked you into
robbing the government installation...

473
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,479
...and then had you
sent to prison for it.

474
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,435
George Kaplan.

475
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,316
I'm not the type
to hold a grudge, George.

476
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:26,319
I used you as a diversion.

477
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,734
I guess down deep,
I was just jealous.

478
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,074
You were one hell of a thief.

479
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,956
To what do I owe
the dishonor of this reunion, Georgie?

480
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:38,210
I wanna make it up to you, kid.
That's why I got you this gig.

481
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,917
And to quote the late, great
Karen Carpenter:

482
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,922
"We have only just begun."

483
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,049
Three minutes, four seconds.

484
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,926
Well you know, George, you're a little late.

485
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,304
Maybe nobody told you.
I quit stealing.

486
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:53,012
- My employer wants a meeting.
- Your employer?

487
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,804
- The president?
- No. Somebody powerful.

488
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,898
Good God, what's that?

489
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,857
Now George, you don't expect me
to fall for that old gag, do you?

490
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,567
Shucks, I guess not.

491
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:10,071
NOW?

492
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,906
Yes, now.

493
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:10,802
No way.

494
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,679
Welcome to Rome, sir.

495
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:41,120
So, Hawk. The Hawkster.
What do you think of the vehicle?

496
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:45,628
Why did you duck
at the auction house, asshole?

497
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:48,711
What can I tell you. I'm the villain.

498
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,922
Initially, it was a priority to keep
a lot of buffers between you and me.

499
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,884
But since most of them are dead now,
I thought, what the heck?

500
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,391
Hawkie, you come
highly recommended.

501
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,726
I hired Kaplan and the Mario brothers
to find me a cat burglar.

502
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,982
Hey. I want to be in business
with you.

503
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,452
♪ I've got the power ♪

504
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,698
♪ I've got the power ♪

505
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,414
Ladies and gentlemen of the board,
and Minerva...

506
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,505
...let's give it up for Hudson Hawk.

507
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,097
Minerva.

508
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,632
Minerva!

509
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:44,347
Hello. Bunny, ball-ball.

510
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,638
So, Hawkmeister...

511
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,648
...we got you clothes, great hotel...

512
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,686
...and a 250,000-lire per diem.

513
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,024
That's $200 a day.

514
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,110
So he can get a hooker
and some tequila?

515
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,649
Veto, Darwin.

516
00:37:55,815 --> 00:38:00,321
I guess we see who wears
the penis in this family, huh?

517
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:03,912
For God's sake,
somebody chain this convict.

518
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,997
Listen, Hawkie.

519
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,960
This might be hard to believe,
but I'm just a regular joe.

520
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,134
I just want to be happy.

521
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,510
And happiness comes...

522
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,512
...from the achieving of goals.

523
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:24,436
It's just that when you've made
your first billion by the age of 19...

524
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:27,393
...it's hard to keep
coming up with new ones.

525
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:32,152
But now, finally,
I got myself a new goal:

526
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,022
World domination!

527
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,499
Shut up!

528
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:49,707
- Bunny, quit that.
- Bunny, ball-ball.

529
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,917
I think Bunny's got
today's ball-balls.

530
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,084
- Bad Bunny.
- Bunny, you weren't that bad.

531
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:58,345
Just two more minutes.
I was so close.

532
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:03,259
But seriously, folks, Concorde me
back home, put me in jail. I don't care.

533
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,474
You go back to jail,
and you won't be alone.

534
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:12,768
You'll have a Guinea barkeep
cellmate to keep you company.

535
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,528
You're young enough to still enjoy
shanking child molesters...

536
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:19,112
...for a pack of smokes.

537
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,276
But Tommy Five-Tone...

538
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,865
...will go in knowing
the next time he gets out...

539
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,952
...will be to attend
his own funeral.

540
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,038
Depressing?

541
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,006
I wouldn't waste a dime
for the phone call.

542
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,091
You don't have any proof.

543
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,552
The magic word.

544
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:47,470
It's "véjà du," Hawkhead:
Something you wish never did happen.

545
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,640
Kaplan and his CIA candy bars shot
the entire operation with hidden cameras.

546
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:56,653
They put the fake horse in the safe
while you clowns were running from the guards.

547
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,525
Yikes.

548
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,194
Damn Fotomat assholes.

549
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,657
That's a good shot of you, Minerva.

550
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,245
My man, you're going
to hit a church.

551
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,910
We want you to steal
da Vinci's sketchbook...

552
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,626
...the Codex.

553
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,790
The Vatican.

554
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,801
I'm robbing
the freaking Vatican.

555
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,463
The nuns at St. Agnes...

556
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,348
...predicted this.

557
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,679
What do they call you guys,
Igg and Ook?

558
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,253
- Hey, man.
- Buon giorno

559
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,587
Yeah, buon giorno.

560
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,093
I'm being blackmailed
into robbing the Vatican...

561
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,095
...by a psychotic
American corporation and the CIA.

562
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,848
I don't...

563
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,977
That's okay, colonel.
Just keep an eye on all the art.

564
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,281
Courtney, stop it.

565
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,238
You're embarrassing
your country.

566
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,666
Though Leonardo
is best known as a painter...

567
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,957
...it was his gift as an inventor...

568
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,593
...who drew together
science and art...

569
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,130
...that is most incredible.

570
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,011
Tough guy.

571
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,101
What are you doing here?

572
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:40,858
You know, every time I get around you,
my heart starts beating really fast.

573
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,444
As you know,
the Da Vinci Codex...

574
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:50,782
...has lived in the Vatican for centuries,
and will continue to live here for centuries more.

575
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,945
That's what you think.

576
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,082
- Question, sir?
- Yeah, what time do you get done?

577
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,084
His untiring pen
predicted the airplane...

578
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,746
...the submarine, the bicycle...

579
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,416
...the helicopter
and even the tank.

580
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,801
These more dangerous designs
inspired him--

581
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,336
Pokey!

582
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,564
- What's the matter? Something wrong?
- Quickly, come with me.

583
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,604
Pokey, come back!

584
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,030
Is that smoke bad for you?

585
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,782
- This way.
- Where are we going?

586
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,288
Through here.

587
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,753
Are you gonna tell me why you did that back there,
or are you gonna blame it on Dumbo?

588
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,292
You mean Pokey?

589
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,052
You believe that
kooky little elephant?

590
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,841
- What in the world is this?
- It's a postal subway.

591
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,227
- Can I get to Times Square from here?
- No.

592
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,104
The pope takes his mail seriously.

593
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,106
Christmas cards, Easter Seals.

594
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,393
Delivers up to 10 at night.

595
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,607
I see.

596
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,272
Well, actually, I don't see.
I'm very confused.

597
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,657
How do you know all this stuff?
What do you do?

598
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,285
Well, I do <i>a</i> lot of things.

599
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,071
But I don't steal stuffed elephants
from little girls.

600
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,456
My life's pretty boring.

601
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:22,585
Yeah, mine too.

602
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,500
You have dinner
with me tonight?

603
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,336
Nice, dull, boring dinner?

604
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,594
Scrabble, knock-knock jokes,
anecdotes about dead Italians?

605
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,346
I'll bring my entire repertoire.

606
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,596
And I'll bring my entire entourage.

607
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,230
There's a place around the corner.

608
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,734
- Enzo's. Say 10:30?
- Ten-thirty.

609
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,146
Hey, thanks.

610
00:44:57,028 --> 00:45:00,123
Father, it's obvious
he's up to something.

611
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,954
Report upstairs at once.

612
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,584
Yes, sir.

613
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,631
Did he mention the Mayﬂowers?

614
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,971
No, your eminence. He's definitely
going to steal the Codex. I can feel it.

615
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,683
- I'm not sure when.
- Attempt to steal, you mean.

616
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,223
The vanity of this man,
Hudson Hawk.

617
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:29,314
The Vatican has foiled the advances
of pirates and terrorists.

618
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:33,573
We will not lie down
for some schmuck from New Jersey.

619
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:40,205
And must you ﬂirt with him
so effectively?

620
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:42,161
That's the only way.

621
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:46,294
As an agent of our organization,
you are put in awkward situations.

622
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:50,673
Just remember, Hudson Hawk
is an evil, evil man.

623
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,146
Yes. Hello, operator.
I'd like to make a collect call...

624
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,657
...overseas, to a New York number.

625
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,989
What? No, no, don't put me--

626
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,283
- Oh, shit.
- Thank you for calling AT&T.

627
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,042
What number
are you calling, please?

628
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:31,832
Thank God. 212-555-1989.

629
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:42,760
Pick up the phone, you
reindeer-goat-cheese-eating bastard.

630
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,598
Pick it up. Pick it up.

631
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,355
Pick it up, Tommy.

632
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,643
The black thing. On the desk.

633
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,188
Come on, Tommy.

634
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,790
Want a little more, Jumbo?

635
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,206
Kick your big, flabby ass.

636
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,295
Hawk.

637
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:19,588
Hawk, Hawk.

638
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,223
- Enjoying Italy?
- Yeah.

639
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,349
Yes.

640
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:28,308
I've always had
a soft spot in my heart for Roma.

641
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:32,817
I did my first
bare-handed strangulation here.

642
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,693
Communist politician.

643
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,399
Why, George, you big softy.

644
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:40,487
God, I miss Communism.

645
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,617
The Red threat.

646
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:46,247
People were scared...

647
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:52,538
...the agency had some respect,
and I got laid every night.

648
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,501
Brief him, Snickers.

649
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,006
Good news, Hawk.

650
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,042
Mayﬂowers have
moved up the timetable.

651
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,462
- You're hitting the Vatican tonight.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

652
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,505
The timing's off,
the schedule's not right...

653
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:05,015
...I'm underequipped,
and besides that, I got a date.

654
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,767
Grapple, biker's bottle...

655
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,553
...pocket fisherman, olive oil...

656
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,936
<i>...100 stamps?</i>

657
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:12,144
Gee, stud, this gonna be some date.

658
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,649
No Harvey's Bristol Cream?

659
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:16,311
Snickers, make that list happen.

660
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,904
Oh, it's one thing
to play hide-and-seek...

661
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,316
...with the Mayflowers'
pathetic staff...

662
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:23,484
...but we're sore losers.

663
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,619
We blow up space shuttles
for breakfast.

664
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,281
You and your friend Tommy
would be nothing more than a...

665
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,324
A late-afternoon Triscuit.

666
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,868
Ciao.

667
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,836
Hey! Old man!

668
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,542
Yeah, you!

669
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,128
You come back here
without your Cub Scout army...

670
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,918
...and I'll kick your
centrally intelligent ass...

671
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:44,134
...up one side the piazza
and down the other!

672
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,731
"Beware the blue wire"?

673
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,773
Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got your stamps.

674
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,529
Good, Yogi.

675
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:42,545
[speaking Italian]

676
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,773
Now, Kit Kat, how did you know
about that blue wire?

677
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,838
[speaking Italian]

678
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:32,965
[speaking Italian]

679
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,681
Oh. I was afraid
you weren't gonna drop by.

680
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,641
Am I late?

681
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,733
You look very nice.

682
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,069
You really do.

683
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,950
- What?
- I am the waiter, sir.

684
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:59,783
Oh, very nice.

685
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:03,165
Fettuccine con funghi porcini.
Prego.

686
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,452
And bring me a bottle of ketchup
with that, will you?

687
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,211
You heard him.

688
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,498
Ketchup. Ketchup.

689
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,132
Stupid Americano!

690
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:14,794
[speaking Italian]

691
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:18,089
Come on, Pierre, read my lips.

692
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,098
Steak burger.

693
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,601
French fries.

694
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,762
This is France.
You got to have french fries.

695
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,930
"Actually, it's Italy, Butterfinger,"
she said...

696
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,895
...as if it made a difference.

697
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:34,856
To be in Paris and in love.

698
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:39,072
[speaking Italian]

699
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:42,033
They had the worst ketchup
when I was in prison.

700
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:45,040
Prison?

701
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,997
I was a warden?

702
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,336
How long were you in?

703
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:53,671
Let's just say I never saw E.T.

704
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:57,507
Wow, you were in the joint...

705
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:01,264
...doing hard time.

706
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:05,178
It's funny, but that excites me.

707
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:07,847
I seem to have a thing for sinners.

708
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,732
I seem to have a thing for sinning.
Check, please.

709
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:13,894
Where did you get the Hawk?

710
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:16,484
Ossining, New York.

711
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,400
Where did you get the
Hudson Hawk?

712
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,695
Well, a "hawk" is a slang word...

713
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:26,240
...for the cold wind
that blows in the wintertime.

714
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,659
I grew up in a town
called Hoboken, New Jersey...

715
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,078
...which is on the Hudson River.

716
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:34,715
- So Hudson River, Hudson Hawk.
- Hudson Hawk.

717
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,467
And where did you get these?

718
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:39,253
Had a little accident
around the house.

719
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,968
- What happened?
- I fell on some chickens.

720
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,882
- Does it hurt?
- Yes, they hurt.

721
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,017
Maybe I can make them
feel better.

722
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,350
Well, okay. See what you can do.

723
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,200
Don't. Don't tickle me.
Don't do it.

724
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,451
Don't do it because-

725
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,738
Because I gotta
tell you something.

726
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,156
What?

727
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,416
No, I better whisper it to you.

728
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,373
Come here.

729
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,831
I can't do this.

730
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,344
What's the matter?

731
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,096
It's been a long time for me.

732
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,474
Well, it's been a really long time
for me.

733
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:29,432
Outside of a friendly dog yesterday morning,
this has been a very slow decade.

734
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:34,730
I don't make love every 10 years,
I get a little cranky.

735
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:38,687
I'm not sure if I remember
how to kiss girls.

736
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,653
Not that I ever kiss guys.

737
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,958
[Italian alarm]

738
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,919
Catholic girls are scary.

739
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,081
- Somebody robbed the Vatican.
- Really?

740
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:05,347
This is not what you think.
Well, maybe it is.

741
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,803
You went and did it.
You really did it.

742
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:11,095
In one day, in less than one day
of planning, and you did it.

743
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,138
You started the week
by stealing the Sforza...

744
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:15,057
-...and ended by swiping the Codex.
- Yeah, but--

745
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,817
What are your weekend plans?
Hoisting away the Colosseum?

746
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,855
- But you don't--
- Tell me, did the devil make you do it?

747
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,820
Or did Darwin
and Minerva Mayﬂower?

748
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:26,110
Can't we just go back
to the kissing part?

749
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,994
What's going on in there?

750
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,534
You want me to rape them?

751
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:38,664
Here, just read your book,
Butterfinger.

752
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,884
"Not in a boat, not on a train.

753
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,971
Not with a goat, not in the rain.

754
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,137
- I do not like green eggs and ham--"
- To yourself. To yourself!

755
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,931
It's more complicated
than that, Hudson.

756
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:58,647
For two years, I've been tracking
the Mayﬂowers' peculiar interest...

757
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,106
...in the three da Vinci pieces.

758
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,770
The Sforza statue was a fake...

759
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,486
...but I was under orders
not to denounce it.

760
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,777
Does everybody in the whole world
know more than me?

761
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:09,741
- You didn't know?
- No.

762
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:14,283
I'm just some guy
that's good at swiping stuff.

763
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,747
Who knew that would lead to this.

764
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:20,881
Christ, they even got
the CIA Involved now.

765
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:24,126
Here's looking at you, kid.

766
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:30,007
Hey. This doesn't taste
like cappuccino.

767
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:34,269
Oh, I guess I put too much
ethyl chloride in it.

768
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:40,810
Why didn't you say at the restaurant
that Hawk had hit the Vatican tonight?

769
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:42,603
My people will not be happy.

770
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,237
I want to see Kaplan.

771
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:56,166
Damn meddlesome
Vatican organization.

772
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:00,037
Hey! Way to go, Anna!

773
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,205
Hudson Hawk had
some interesting things to say...

774
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,374
...about you and the Mayﬂowers.

775
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,215
Basically, that you're all part
of the same car pool.

776
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:11,757
Anna, Anna, Anna,
if that were so...

777
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,516
...Almond Joy would've
handed you your heart...

778
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:16,053
...right after you handed her
the Codex.

779
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,096
No, now the trip is this:

780
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,732
Soon as the Mayﬂowers find out
we have the Codex...

781
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:22,268
...they're gonna want to make a deal.

782
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:25,062
We deal, they'll buy, we bust.

783
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,072
- A classic sting.
- What happens to Hudson Hawk?

784
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,075
Oh, I wouldn't worry too much
about him. He's...

785
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,202
He's gonna be in very good hands.

786
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,080
But you, you look really tired, kiddo.

787
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,116
Maybe you should go back
to Rome and get some sleep.

788
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:43,255
Kit Kat? Oh, there you are.

789
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:46,383
See that Miss Baragli
gets home safely.

790
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,087
Arrividerci, baby.

791
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,720
With all due respect
to that great dress...

792
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,601
...how come you didn't you let me
cut her heart out?

793
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:00,014
Close call, close call.

794
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:05,186
But she's the only way we have keeping tabs
on the damn mysterious Vatican organization.

795
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,025
Bunny Mayflower.

796
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:14,907
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

797
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,664
It's been 1200 hours
since my last confession.

798
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,871
Hit me with your best shot.

799
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,956
I betrayed a man.

800
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,918
A good man. An innocent man

801
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,297
A thief.

802
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,050
Anna, what are you trying to say?

803
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:32,133
Father, we've been
double-crossed by the CIA.

804
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,639
Hudson Hawk is not
who we thought he was.

805
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:37,768
He came into a world where crime
is a legitimate business tactic...

806
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:39,803
...and a legitimate
government procedure...

807
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,893
...but he knew right from wrong.

808
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,433
Oh, and we kind of messed around.

809
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:48,649
[speaking Italian]

810
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,860
Messed around? Messed around?!

811
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:57,787
Seventeen Hail Marys
and five minutes outside.

812
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:02,668
So, Sister, what you are saying
is that Hudson Hawk...

813
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,079
...is not willingly working
for the Mayﬂowers...

814
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:09,375
...but that Kaplan
and the candy bars are?

815
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,669
I thought we were using the CIA
to get to Mayﬂower...

816
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:15,055
...but the CIA is using me
to keep us away from Mayﬂower.

817
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,638
Oh, the pope warned me
never to trust the CIA.

818
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,974
If the Mayflowers get all three crystals
for the gold machine...

819
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,606
...the world economy will be ruined.

820
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,142
Ay-yi-yi.

821
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,107
Lord help us.

822
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:33,649
But what of Tommy Five-Tone,
Hawk's friend? Where's his loyalty?

823
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,032
I'm going to find out.

824
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:36,614
But you must remember, Sister...

825
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:40,326
...you have your vows to God
as well as your mission to the world.

826
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,708
Yes, Your Eminence.

827
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,210
Just say, "God go with me."

828
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,587
God go with you, Sister.

829
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,629
Ball!

830
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,339
Ball!

831
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,130
Ball!

832
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,220
Jolly good shot, sir.

833
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,557
Oh, Hudson Hawk.

834
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,848
You cease to amaze me, convict.

835
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:08,233
You are a terrible cat burglar.

836
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,485
Haven't you ever seen,
like, David Niven?

837
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,317
Tiptoe in, tiptoe out.

838
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,573
Like a cat, one would say.

839
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,110
I could take it back.

840
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,029
- Let me do that.
- I don't care.

841
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:35,635
Oh, you two! There's nothing
I hate more than failure.

842
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,671
All you had to do
was follow the Hawk.

843
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:41,683
It's not like I said teach
our nation's children how to read.

844
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,764
I suppose we're just going to
have to kill them.

845
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,603
God, Minerva, I was just joking.

846
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,961
- Get away from there, convict.
- Just browsing.

847
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,715
Don't hurt him.
We need him for the final job.

848
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:16,126
Oh, really?

849
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:17,886
Don't hurt him?

850
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,593
Even if he does this?

851
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,091
What about this?

852
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:27,145
Surely, this must offend!

853
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:32,105
Things are really heating up
at the Castle Vinci tonight!

854
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,894
Ooh, mamma mia, pizzeria!

855
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,107
May I call you Minnie?

856
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:38,319
You put your left foot in
You put your left foot out

857
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,233
Come to think of it,
there is a part of your body...

858
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,325
...that you won't be needing
for your next job.

859
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,581
I always did wanna
sing like Frankie Valli.

860
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:50,290
Big boys don't cry.

861
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:56,342
Three minutes, 27 seconds.

862
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,879
Look, you Eddie Munster-looking
motherfucker...

863
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:04,220
...somebody better tell me what's going on,
or I ain't gonna move another muscle.

864
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,760
- I wanna be treated like an adult.
- That's fair.

865
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,896
Now go to your room.

866
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:13,729
What?

867
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:22,113
So, Captain Hawk,
in one of your paws...

868
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,154
...you've got a gold bar
worth about eight thou.

869
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,915
In the autre, you've got lead
that won't get you gelato.

870
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:32,328
Surely a master thief like you
can tell the difference.

871
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:34,667
That's one down. Kitty Carlisle.

872
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,206
Cool, isn't it?

873
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:40,219
Weight, feel, malleability.
They're all but identical.

874
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:44,177
On the periodic chart of elements
they're but one proton apart.

875
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:49,311
Great minds worked for centuries
to turn worthless into priceless.

876
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:50,516
Alchemy?

877
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:53,181
Alchemy is the business term
of the '90s, my man.

878
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:57,103
Minerva read it in an airline magazine
about four years ago.

879
01:04:57,268 --> 01:05:00,693
I dumped some lire into research
and, shazam!

880
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,483
We come across a diary
by one of da Vinci's assistants...

881
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,745
...detailing Ia macchina d'oro--

882
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,031
"The gold machine,"
for the hoes at home.

883
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,575
--And the rest is
about to become history.

884
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,414
Money isn't everything.

885
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,169
Gold is.

886
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,420
Fuck T-bills!

887
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:17,922
Fuck blue-chip stocks!

888
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:19,298
Fuck junk bonds!

889
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,255
We've got the real deal.

890
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,261
Money will always be paper...

891
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,924
...but gold will always be gold.

892
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,888
After a couple of years
of steady production...

893
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,597
...we'll ﬂood the market
with so much gold...

894
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,639
<i>...that</i> gold itself,
the foundation of all finance...

895
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:35,273
...will lose its meaning.

896
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:38,106
Brokers, economists,
fellow entrepreneurs...

897
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:42,068
...will drown in the saliva
of their own nervous breakdowns.

898
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,277
Sounds like a party.

899
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,238
Markets will crash-crash.

900
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,370
Financial empires
will crumble-crumble.

901
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:50,496
Except yours-yours.

902
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:53,329
In 1992, baby...

903
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,164
...the European superpowers
are coming together...

904
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:57,670
...to form one business superpower.

905
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:00,924
And that's one party
we're gonna love to poop.

906
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,208
Well, that's set.

907
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:06,881
The last ingredient in the recipe
is da Vinci's model of a helicopter.

908
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:10,767
On display for three days only
at the Louvre, in Paris.

909
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,518
As opposed to the Louvre
in Wisconsin?

910
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:14,520
Shut up.
You'll make me lose my place.

911
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,181
You're gonna have
to go in at night.

912
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,600
_ The security will be overwhelming.
- Twelve guards--

913
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,111
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
Okay, time out.

914
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,069
I choose not to accept
the assignment, Mr. Phelps.

915
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,278
Put me in jail. Put me and--

916
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:27,909
Jail, you asshole?!

917
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:31,071
Our foot soldiers
will blow your brains out.

918
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,910
Bunny? Ball-ball.

919
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,872
I'll torture you so slowly,
you'll think it's a career.

920
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:40,756
I'll kill your friends, your family
and the bitch you took to the prom.

921
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:43,508
Betty Jo Biarsky?
I can get you an address on that, if you want.

922
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,509
You have a dilemma, tiger.

923
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,968
And I think I know what's gonna
help you solve it.

924
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:55,808
I'll kill you all!

925
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:59,565
I swear to God. I'll kill that butler.
I'll kill that little yappy dog.

926
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:03,570
I'm sick of this!

927
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:11,828
I hated cigarettes until I saw
my first "no smoking" sign.

928
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,159
"Keep off the grass"?

929
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:16,165
Let's play soccer.

930
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:19,203
The only law I cared for
was friendship.

931
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,714
I broke that one, too, didn't I?

932
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:28,713
I just don't think that it's such a smoking-hot
idea to leave them in there alone.

933
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:29,925
Relax, George.

934
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,932
That's why we hired the
pasta-slurping Guinea to begin with...

935
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:34,263
...to keep Hawk in line.

936
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:37,520
This Gates-Mario brothers-
CIA-Mayﬂower-da Vinci thing...

937
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:41,729
<i>...l</i> mean, it seemed like
a sweet deal.

938
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,939
Visit foreign lands,
take their treasures.

939
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:46,446
I don't know, Eddie,
I thought you'd get into it.

940
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:51,405
It's better than playing darts
with M.B.A.s at the bar.

941
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:54,321
But I didn't think
it was gonna be like this.

942
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:58,367
Them using me to use you.

943
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:02,504
I'm sorry, Eddie...

944
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:06,041
...but there's only
one way out of this...

945
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:09,928
...and it's gonna hurt me
more than it's gonna hurt you.

946
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:16,051
They'll talk about being buddies
and chugging brewskis.

947
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,515
You've got to love male bonding.

948
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,820
You fucked my freedom
for a lousy job?

949
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,284
Come on!

950
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,083
- You know something, Eddie?
- What?

951
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,795
- You hit like a girl!
- Oh, really?

952
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,172
I was only kidding.

953
01:08:55,757 --> 01:08:56,929
[gunshot]

954
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,512
Tommy! No!

955
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,601
Tommy!

956
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:19,706
Plan B, George.

957
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,456
Plan B?

958
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:55,112
No sweat, Tommy. You just made
the biggest mistake of my life.

959
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,527
Don't act like you never
committed a crime before.

960
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,822
- I know I made a bad call.
- What was your per diem?

961
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:03,036
- Thank God you're dead.
- It was so beautiful.

962
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,829
When those blanks went off,
everybody freaked.

963
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:11,462
- Ketchup. You can't beat Heinz 57.
- Five-Tone.

964
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,592
- What?
- You fucked my freedom for a job?

965
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,379
- You don't understand.
- I said I was sorry.

966
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,344
You better be glad I don't hit women,
assuming you are a woman,

967
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:20,304
because from now on,
I ain't taking nothing for granted.

968
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,763
- Hey, look, Eddie, I'm sorry.
- Hudson, I'm sorry.

969
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,554
I work for a covert Vatican
humanitarian organization...

970
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,394
...and the CIA
made a fool out of me.

971
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:27,853
- What's more...
- Hey, man...

972
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:31,019
-...I care for you.
-...l love you.

973
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:33,233
- Then what's this?
- Where did you get that?

974
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:34,773
The da Vinci castle.

975
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,488
You know, the place where you
gave the bad guys the Codex.

976
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,744
- That's from the gold machine.
- Yeah.

977
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,495
So they really were that
close to making it work.

978
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:44,533
But now that they lost the services
of the world's greatest cat burglar...

979
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:45,871
...and his dead partner...

980
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,127
They won't be able to steal
the third piece of the crystal.

981
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:51,460
And we get to go home.

982
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:54,000
- Five-Tone, let me ask you something.
- Go ahead.

983
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,920
Why do they leave all these rocks
and shit laying out in the backyard?

984
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:58,554
They're called ruins, Eddie.

985
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,431
- Ruins, huh?
- Yeah, ruins.

986
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,592
Good name.

987
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:12,228
He had this look on his face
when we caught him. It was like...

988
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,771
I never saw a look on a face like this
when he got caught.

989
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,235
I swear to God,
he was so embarrassed.

990
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:19,446
You know,
speaking of being caught...

991
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,078
...isn't the CIA gonna think
to check out this place?

992
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:23,863
No, they fell for the fake death.

993
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,658
They think Hawk's been arrested.

994
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,203
Kaplan and the candy bars were seen
by my sources boarding a plane out of Rome.

995
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:32,121
- Hudson.
- Where to?

996
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,006
Five-Tone, will you quit
worrying about it, man.

997
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,759
I'm not worried, alright,
I'm just being cautious.

998
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:40,013
Okay, guys.
On that note, it's time for bed.

999
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:42,173
- I couldn't agree more.
- Okay.

1000
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:48,021
Tommy, you're gonna sleep here.

1001
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:51,308
- Where are you gonna sleep?
- What do you think?

1002
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:52,691
Oh, yeah. Good night.

1003
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,397
I'll get you some sheets.

1004
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,483
Yeah, we'll get you some sheets.

1005
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:03,696
- It's a very special night.
- Yes, it was.

1006
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,784
- Is.
- Was.

1007
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:08,075
There's some things
you don't know about me.

1008
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,164
But there's some things
I do know about you...

1009
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:14,206
...and about me,
and about that bed.

1010
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:16,716
This is not the time, Hudson.

1011
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:20,963
Look, can't we just have
a late-night cappuccino?

1012
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:25,178
I'm sorry, but the machine's
still set up for poisonous foam.

1013
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:30,689
- Oh, yeah. I remember.
- Good night.

1014
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,690
Good night.

1015
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:41,654
Don't even think about it.

1016
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:43,363
Don't say another word.

1017
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:46,496
It's a very special night

1018
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,248
Very funny. Very funny, Tommy.

1019
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,055
Good morning.

1020
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:16,317
The license plates on the police van
had a Vatican prefix.

1021
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:18,193
I'm losing respect for you guys.

1022
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:22,152
You were that close
to getting away with this crap.

1023
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:23,783
- Get up.
- Now, where's Anna?

1024
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,534
You know, George,
it's nice of you guys to drop by...

1025
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:28,037
...but next time,
you might want to phone ahead.

1026
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:29,697
Why don't you come back in a half-hour.

1027
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:32,458
Grab ourselves a shower,
pick up some croissants and shit.

1028
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:37,088
I really wish I could come up with this
glib repartee, the way you guys can.

1029
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,796
But I can't.
So I'll just paralyze you. A.J.?

1030
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:44,174
Curare darts.

1031
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:45,839
When it comes
to instantaneous loss...

1032
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,882
...of all physical control
below the neck...

1033
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:51,053
-...I highly recommend them.
- Eddie, I can't move!

1034
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:53,596
I'm gonna rip
their fucking tongues out!

1035
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,232
Come here, you chickenshit
son of a bitches!

1036
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,690
Come here!
My head against yours.

1037
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,069
Fair fight!

1038
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,777
This is how I go out.
Like <i>a</i> hunk of frozen Play-Doh?

1039
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,863
Like a Gumby in the store?

1040
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:08,073
What the fuck are you la--?
Keep laughing, Jumbo.

1041
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:09,612
You made it come out of my nose.

1042
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:10,826
Keep that shit up!

1043
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:13,912
This is no way, George,
to get me to rob the Louvre.

1044
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,544
The Louvre'?

1045
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:21,833
The Louvre, Hawk,
is yesterday's news.

1046
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:24,218
Or should I say this morning's?

1047
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:26,345
I admit we displayed
a lack of nuance.

1048
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:29,007
Didn't wear black,
didn't sing "Swinging on a Star."

1049
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:32,143
Well, we weren't being judged
for neatness...

1050
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,053
...only results.

1051
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,314
Goddamn it. Yanks lose again.

1052
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:40,067
- How did the Mets do?
- Can you turn to section B.

1053
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:45,986
You guys may be
the fairest cat burglars of them all...

1054
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,116
...but if you weren't
such snobs...

1055
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:52,826
...a lot of those guards at the Louvre
might still be alive.

1056
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:54,957
But that's irrelevant now.

1057
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:06,093
You're irrelevant now.

1058
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,175
Because tonight...

1059
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,840
...at the Castle da Vinci...

1060
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,384
...we make gold!

1061
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,552
Rise and shine, sleepyheads.

1062
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:16,187
Ah, more babes for the party.

1063
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:17,813
- Hi, Anna.
- Hi, Anna.

1064
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:21,146
Don't be stupid, Mr. Kaplan.
Give me the crystal.

1065
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,060
Anna Baragli...

1066
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,525
Came to play!

1067
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,656
Anna-banana-fo-fanna.

1068
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:30,034
You're not gonna shoot
little old me, are you?

1069
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,115
You're not gonna
shoot little old anybody.

1070
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:34,121
- Pull the trigger. Shoot.
- Shoot, Anna.

1071
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:35,657
I read your dossier...

1072
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:38,201
-...Sister.
- Pull the trigger!

1073
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,997
Why did she call you Sister?

1074
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:45,337
I'm sorry, Hudson,
I meant to tell you.

1075
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:47,922
- He didn't know.
- He didn't know!

1076
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,132
Know what?

1077
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,389
Hawk likes a nun!

1078
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,639
Those better be tears
you're crying, Tommy.

1079
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:01,478
They are.

1080
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,108
It doesn't mean I don't love you.

1081
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:06,066
Oh, no. You love me. It's your job!

1082
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,447
You probably love
Butterfingers over there.

1083
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:09,653
Well, yeah.

1084
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,989
In <i>a</i> weird sort of Catholic way, I do.

1085
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:15,246
But you...

1086
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,452
You...

1087
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:23,914
Well, Miss Baragli's da Vinci expertise
allows her to go on to the next course.

1088
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,129
- And <i>as</i> for you guys...
- Sorry, guys.

1089
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:33,510
A souvenir.

1090
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,299
Ciao.

1091
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,020
- Later, guys.
- Easy for you to say.

1092
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:44,441
Guys, we got some good news
and some bad news.

1093
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,444
The good news is you'll be
completely unparalyzed in about two minutes.

1094
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:52,154
The bad news is that leaves you only
five seconds to defuse the bombs.

1095
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:53,863
- Bombs?
- Bombs?

1096
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,663
I'm so glad it had to be like this.

1097
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:04,295
I'll just shoot one in the kitchen
for good measure.

1098
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,922
Almond Joy! More paralysis!

1099
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,301
- You can move?
- Yeah.

1100
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,095
This is what I get
for darting <i>a</i> nun!

1101

Get this fucking thing off my head!

1102
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:28,277
- Tommy, look at Snickers.
- He's about to have a bad migraine.

1103
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:30,688
Maybe it was a dud.

1104
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:48,881
I don't know. It must be the curare.

1105
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:51,292
It's been known to have
certain side effects.

Oh, really, George?

I feel like a dolphin
who's never tasted melted snow.

1108
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:01,724
Listen, Anna. The apprentice's diary
contains a code...

1109
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:06,187
...that explains how the three
pieces of crystal fit together.

1110
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,941
If you could do us the honor...

1111
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:12,025
...and decipher how the code works,
we would be eternally grateful.

What does the color blue
taste like?

1113

Bobo knows.

Darwin, this is supposed to
be torture, not therapy.

- Eddie, the old man said turn left at the fork.
- He said turn right.

1119
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:41,096
If you wanna save Anna,
you gotta find the castle first.

1120
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:45,058
- Quit pushing.
- I'm not pushing.

1121

- Why not just go now?

- Okay. Hey, Tommy.
- What?

1123

- Who are you, Bob Hope for Texaco?
- What the hell are you talking about?

1124
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,238
- What are you doing with that golf bag?
- I got a plan.

1125
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,778
- Is it a great plan?
- A great big plan.

1126
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,636
- Tommy, let me ask you something.
- Go ahead.

1127
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:24,098
- How do I look?
- You look great. What, are you kidding?

1128
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,807
No. I want you to tell me.
Come on.

You look gorgeous.

01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:20,346
Oh, Hawk, don't ever change.

1249
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:24,387
Nice Hawk.

1250
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,553
Nice Hawk.

1251
01:28:29,179 --> 01:28:30,806
Bad Hawk!

1252
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:45,412
Why is the world jam-packed
with such idiots?

1253
01:28:45,904 --> 01:28:50,580
Every schmo has the fantasy that
the planet revolves around them.

1254
01:28:50,742 --> 01:28:53,541
It rains. A car crash stops traffic.

1255
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:56,081
You say, "How can
this happen to me?"

1256
01:28:56,248 --> 01:29:00,424
But for us, this isn't a fantasy.

1257
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,337
<i>N</i> is a reality.

1258
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:05,474
Oh, yes. If da Vinci
was alive today...

1259
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:07,976
...he'd be eating
microwave sushi, naked...

1260
01:29:08,134 --> 01:29:10,978
...in the back of a Cadillac
with the both of us.

1261
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:12,980
The project of his life...

1262
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:15,858
<i>...is</i> now the toy of mine.

1263
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:20,773
History, tradition, culture
are not concepts.

1264
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:24,864
These are trophies I keep in my den
as paperweights.

1265
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:28,155
The chaos we will cause the world
with this machine...

1266
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:31,746
...will be our final masterpiece.

1267
01:29:31,908 --> 01:29:34,206
Go, team, go!

1268
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:36,960
Go, team, go!

1269
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:39,791
Go, team, go!

1270
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:42,465
Yes!

1271
01:29:53,013 --> 01:29:54,230
NOW!

1272
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:10,868
Eureka, motherfucker!

1273
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:14,126
Well, you should feel very good
about yourself.

1274
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:16,378
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

1275
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:19,255
What would happen if I didn't put
that crystal together exactly right?

1276
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:20,461
What do you mean?

1277
01:30:20,624 --> 01:30:24,094
Well, let's just say, for example,
I left out...

1278
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,471
...this little piece of mirror here.

1279
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:30,555
- Would that be bad?
- Real bad.

1280
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:31,889
Good.

1281
01:30:41,227 --> 01:30:43,901
Minerva! Minerva!

1282
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,535
Alfred!

1283
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:09,089
- Your turn.
- My turn?

1284
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:12,225
How'd it get to be my turn?
I just killed Darwin and Minerva!

1285
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,683
- Definitely your tum.
- Shit.

1286
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:19,942
All right. Just stay over here
and try to stay out of the way, alright?

1287
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,943
- Hudson.
- What?

1288
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:31,369
<i>Okay-</i>

1289
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,260
Thou shalt not kill!
Thou shalt not kill!

1290
01:31:47,419 --> 01:31:48,671
Sorry!

1291
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,358
Stop helping me!

1292
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:10,575
Hey, Alfred...

1293
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:16,531
...you won't be attending
that hat convention in July.

1294
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:25,419
- My turn?
- Yeah.

1295
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:30,670
With this dog, now?

1296
01:32:34,174 --> 01:32:35,596
Oh, Bunny.

1297
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:39,016
Ball-ball.

1298
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:45,603
Come on, puppy chow, gotta go.

1299
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:03,832
Here we go.

1300
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:05,497
Move your hand! Take it away!

1301
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:23,565
Just hang on.

1302
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:38,496
Oh, Leonardo.

1303
01:33:40,115 --> 01:33:42,493
Go, Leonardo!

1304
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:48,752
Oh, baby!

1305
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:51,713
Hi, kids.

1306
01:34:03,388 --> 01:34:06,437
- Anna?
- Yes, Hudson?

1307
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:07,896
Can I ask you something?

1308
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:10,608
Sure.

1309
01:34:11,521 --> 01:34:13,865
Will you play Nintendo with me?

1310
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:18,199
I can't think of anybody
I'd rather play Nintendo with.

1311
01:34:28,538 --> 01:34:30,131
Wait a minute.

1312
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:32,258
- What about your boss?
- What boss?

1313
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,010
You know.

1314
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:36,592
Oh, I think he wants me
to keep an eye on you.

1315
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:39,678
You know, I think he wants you
to keep an eye on me too.

1316
01:34:39,841 --> 01:34:42,185
Because I got criminal tendencies.

1317
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:44,721
- Can I buy you a cappuccino?
- Yes.

1318
01:34:44,888 --> 01:34:47,391
- Can I give you a kiss?
- Yes.

1319
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:51,898
I just wish Tommy were here.

1320
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:54,526
No way.

1321
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:55,906
That's not very nice.

1322
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:57,408
No way!

1323
01:34:57,567 --> 01:34:59,410
Yes way!

1324
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:04,365
Did I miss anything?

1325
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:05,624
Did you miss anything?

1326
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,751
You're supposed to be all crashed up
at the bottom of the hill.

1327
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:10,585
Air bags.
Can you fucking believe it?

1328
01:35:10,747 --> 01:35:13,000
You're supposed to be blown up
into fiery chunks of flesh.

1329
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:15,168
Sprinkler system
set up in the back.

1330
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:18,839
Can you fucking believe it?!

1331
01:35:19,005 --> 01:35:21,178
Yeah, that's probably
what happened.

1332
01:35:21,341 --> 01:35:23,139
Drink your cappuccino.

1333
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:26,521
Hey. Drink your coffee.

1334
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:41,862
With the world saved and
the secrets of da Vinci protected...

1335
01:35:42,028 --> 01:35:44,827
...Eddie finally got his coffee.
