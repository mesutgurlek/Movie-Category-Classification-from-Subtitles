13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,522
the Atlas Centaur rocket
blasted off from our planet,

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,100
a four-stage rocket
that launched a probe

15

way out into the blackness of space.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,980
The probe would use
the energy from the sun

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,180
and the gravitational pull
of our neighbouring planets

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,770
to cross our solar system.

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,220
That momentum would then carry it on

20
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,687

of the universe.

The probe carried a tablet
which had inscribed on it

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,620
the image of us humans,
a man and a woman,

25

and a map to locate us in the universe.

is Mortimer Stanley,

whose latest novel is entitled
What You See With Your Eyes Open.

401
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,140
Mortimer, your last novel
was published nearly ten years ago.

402
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,564
It got what they call "mixed reviews"
and sold fewer than 3,000 copies.

You were estranged, weren't you?

406
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,770
Well, yes, but on her deathbed,
she urged me to write another book.

407
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,340
Knowing that she would never
have to read it?

Well, he was 14, James.
It's got nothing to do with his book.

Well, neither has the show, Cath.

412
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,083
Listen, what upsets Fenella about you
is your integrity.

413
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,968

That wouldn't be fair to you, Cath.

This is a wonderful opportunity
for you to get to know the real me.

No, not just the charming,

Yes, I've got an intruder in room 405.

429
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,491
Or the mastermind behind
warrantless domestic surveillance.

Okay, Grant, I appreciate
that you like me...

432
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,885
Like? Like? What do you think,
I'm one of these cardboard cut-outs?

433
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,205
Like? No. No, no, no. Adulate. Worship.

434
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,841
Okay, well, I don't adulate
or worship you.

435
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,731
I don't even really like you.

436
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,725
So that's why I'm asking you
to just go away and leave me alone.

437
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,369
- So there's some hope?
- No, no, no. There's no hope.

438
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,651
Cath, I came all the way to England
to see you.

439
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,524
Doesn't that show you
how much I care about you?

440
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,140
No, it shows me that you're obsessed.
Obsession's not a quality that I admire.

Oh, well, um, what did you want, then?

784
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,690
DENNIS: Shag her, Neil!

785
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,644
That's Dennis.

786
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,140
- Dennis?
- Yeah. He is a plumber.

787
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,050
Um, I'm having a few problems
with my waterworks. My water pipes.

788
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,366
DENNIS: Shag her, Neil!

789
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,491
I'd better get him the shagger.
It's a special wrench that plumbers use.

790
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,340
(WHISPERING)
I thought I told you to shut up.

791
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,602
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, sorry.

792
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,340
You're supposed to be
a rational, thinking creature.

793
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,284
Sorry, sorry. Can't help myself. Sorry.
Oh, dear. I wanna shag your leg.

794
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,448
NEIL: Shh. It's not a great time,
to be honest.

795
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,980
Maybe later, if you behave.

796
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,140
DENNIS: Oh...

797
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,620
Oh... Couldn't... Couldn't find the shagger,
so he just went with the old decoupler.

798
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,300
DENNIS: I love you, Neil!

799
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,528
Shut up, Dennis!

800
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,980
It's odd, isn't it,
shouting at the plumber like that?

801
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,460
But, uh, the fact is he's my brother.
The plumber is my brother.

802
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,961
DENNIS: Say you love me, Neil.

803
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,180
And we're very close.

804
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,408
- God, Rosie was right.
- Rosie?

805
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,966
DENNIS: Please can I shag your leg?

806
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:03,205
Jesus, Neil, how could you?
The next morning!

807
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,726
What? I...

808
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,380
- Why do I always end up with creeps?
- I'm not a creep!

809
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,484
DENNIS: There was a cat, Neil!
Neil! Hey, you, cat!

810
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,380
Stay out of my garden, go on!
Neil, it's a ginger tom!

814
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,340
So she thinks I'm gay.

815
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,820
(LAUGHING) I mean, so what, you know?

816
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,129
I mean, it means that she won't want to
marry me or have my kids.

817
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,282
Bingo. Problem solved.

818
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,645
Thank you, Dennis.

Um, me be on the bus.

I mean in the bus.

to worship you, okay?

- Not like this.
- Ray, I don't have time for this.

Wait, wait, wait.
You haven't lost the powers, have you?

Oh. That's his car.

But I love you.

You also love Dennis, apparently.

- Did you take that off there?
- Uh, no, this is mine.

- Yours?
- Yeah.

Look, you've got it all wrong
about Dennis.

You love him, he loves you.

I'm happy for both of you.
Just don't bring me into it.

Yeah, no, but there's something I need
to tell you about Dennis.

855
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,460
You are going to have to pay for that
now that you've touched it.

- It's mine!
- No, it isn't.

Look, I heard what you
said to each other, Neil.

Yeah, look. There's something crucial
about Dennis you don't know.

- He's not a man.

he's not a man.

You come in here and steal our stuff?

I told you, that's not your sausage.

- It is my sausage. Give it back.
- Get off. Be careful, be careful.

- Just let go!
- Oh, God!

- Give me 80p.
- Fine.

869

- I'll just get your change.
- No, it's... Never mind. It's...

00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,340
Well, no, cos it's £4.20.

- Keep it.
- It's too much for a tip.

- Have it your way.
- I should think so, too. Jesus.

Feck. Sausage, become Ray.

how vulnerable a sausage feels?

We must follow galactic procedure.

Rules didn't stop you from eating

Because they love

- I know it's the bell, Dennis.
- Right. No, no, sorry.

934
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,407
Just one more peep out of you, okay,
and the flea collar is going back on again.

935
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,020
Right, right, right.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

936
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,360
Bark.

937
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,606
Woof.

938
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,451
Do it properly.

939
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,969
- (BARKING)
- Yeah, good. Okay, thank you.

940
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,525
Got it.

941
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,100
- Hi.
- Has he gone?

942
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,565
No, I don't think so.

943
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,883
- Ooh!
- Dennis, down.

944
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,260
You named him after the plumber,
then, did you?

945
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,771
Uh...

946
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,244
Ah. Do you want your tummy tickled?

947
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,246
Why do dogs like that so much?

948
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,020
I don't know.

949
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,884
(CATHERINE LAUGHING)

950
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,620
So the producer promises to take me
out of the general office

951
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:40,166
and give me a big desk with a view,
but he won't.

952
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,643
He's just trying to get me into bed.

953
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,844
What did you want to tell me?

954
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,324
Uh, just try this first.

955
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,601
Mmm.

956
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,525
Oh, that's incredible.

957
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,282
That's the most wonderful thing
I've ever tasted in my life.

958
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,100
Mmm. I had no idea you were
such a fantastic cook.

959
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,841
I've... I've... It's unlike anything
I've ever tasted. What is it?

960
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,360
I just said, "Let the soup be the most
amazing thing Catherine has ever tasted,

961
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,300
"unlike anything she's tasted before."

962
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,780
- And it is. (LAUGHING)
- Really?

963
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:41,843
Really. I can make things happen.
Anything.

964
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,940
That's what I was trying to tell you
this morning, you know?

965
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,300
I wasn't talking to a live-in
homosexual plumber.

966
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,050
I was talking to Dennis.

967
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,848
- The dog?
- Dennis the dog.

968
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,408
- Who answered you back?
- Yeah, because I made him talk.

969
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,567
- Oh.
- With my powers.

970
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,605
Special powers?

971
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,340
I mean, what, you...
You want a bigger desk? You got it.

972
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,249
You want a great view? You got it.

973
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,928
Um... Neil, how long have you had
these special powers?

974
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,340
Well, they came upon me very suddenly.

975
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,762
- Very suddenly?
- Yeah, I was knocked off my bike.

976
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,700
Just ask me to do something, anything.

977
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,088
- Just, you know...
- Listen, Neil, it's... It's okay.

978
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,180
You can get help with this.

979
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,770
GRANT: Son of a bitch!

980
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,121
CATHERINE: Oh!

981
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,811
Shit, Grant!

982
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,081
DENNIS: I'm out of here!

983
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,540
- There's nobody else, huh?
- Who is this guy?

984
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,860
She didn't tell you? I'm her fiancé.

985
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,644
- You're not my fiancé, Grant.
- Oh, yeah?

986
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,020
And you weren't just making out
with this apology of a man?

987
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,406
Stop this.

988
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,340
You know how long you'd last
on a battlefield, soldier?

989
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,540
I'm sorry, Neil.

990
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,722
- (SNAPS FINGERS) That long.
- I'm warning you.

991
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,540
- You're warning me?
- Yeah, I'm warning you.

992
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,220
(LAUGHING) Who is this guy?

993
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,243
- Why don't you suck on this, asshole?
- Grant!

994
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,380
All I have to do is go like this and...
And say what?

995
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,802
- Where did you find this fruitcake?
- Put that away, Grant.

996
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,060
Uh, what can I say?
Grant, become a fairy?

997
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,640
It's Grant, not...
(BRITISH ACCENT) ...Grant.

998
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,728
- Stop it.
- And you're the goddamn fairy.

999
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,700
How about Grant go back
to where you came from?

1000
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,201
- It's Grant.
- How about kiss my arse, Grant?

1001
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,940
Neil, don't. He's crazy.

1002
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,620
How about you say, "Please, Grant,
don't put a bullet through my brain?"

1003
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,611
- Grant, stop it!
- I prefer, "Let all bullets bounce off me."

1004
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,380
- Go on, shoot me.
- Oh, my God. You're both crazy.

1005
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,540
- He doesn't dare.
- Neil, please, please.

1006
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,220
Go on, pull the trigger.
What's the matter, "Grant"?

1007
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,651
- Shut up.
- Go on, shoot me.

1008
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,220
- Neil, he will.
- No, he won't.

1009
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,220
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't. Grant, drop the gun.

- You little shit!
- (SHRIEKS)

Let Grant's arm break
if he tries to throttle me.

Maybe I can help you.

- You?
- I could make your life absolutely hell

Fuck! Come on!

you're going to say exactly what's on that
piece of paper, you understand?

1059

The moment you say a word that is not on
that piece of paper, I kill the dog.

out now. Remember, one wrong word

He got Miss Pringle to... To worship me
and now she's turned me into a religion.

1085
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,962
- They think I'm immortal.
- So what?

1086
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,724
They want me to prove it
by rising from the dead.

We've got to find Neil.

What are you doing?

1091
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,925
(CATHERINE SIGHS) No...

1092
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,121
Got it.

1093
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,300
- Where's your car?
- Why?

1094

Okay, keep going. Number three. Let's go.

I'm afraid, Janet, that we have been
calling ourselves

1204
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,166
The shame of it.

what should we be calling you?

Who cares about waffles?

1210
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:01,562
Catherine hates me. Ray hates me.
Everybody hates me.

1211
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,167
I don't hate you and I
care about waffles.

1212
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,940
I think I like them even more
than biscuits, even red biscuits.

This is all my fault.

1215
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,660
You know, I was just thinking
about myself, what I could get.

1216
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,900
- Hmm.
- And yet with these powers, you know,

1217
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,367
I could have solved every
problem in the world.

1218
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:22,900
- I could have made people happy.
- You couldn't make Catherine happy.

1219
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,020
Yeah, because I wanted her to love me.
You know, I was being selfish.

1220
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,169
I mean, take world hunger,
you know? Uh...

1221
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,880
Let everybody in the world have as much
food as they want.

1222
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,887
I mean, take homelessness. Let everybody
in the world have somewhere to live.

1223
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,242
No, no, no, live in their dream house.

1224
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:46,540
And war, senseless war, over forever.

1225
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,928
Let there be no reason for anyone
to make war on anyone any more.
