00:56:24,126 --> 00:56:28,278
I'm trying to do a voodoo ritual.
It's important to get the right ingredients.

784
00:56:28,366 --> 00:56:32,279

VELMA: They use the protoplasm in the vat
as an energy source.

791
00:56:47,246 --> 00:56:51,683
And the leader needs to absorb
a purely good soul to complete the ritual.

792
00:56:51,766 --> 00:56:54,917
Legend has it, once the Darkopolypse ritual
is performed...

793

...the creatures will rule all Earth
for 10,000 years.

beast up in my house to protect myself.
