I'm gonna find the One Piece

<i>and his friends venture into that sea.</i>

45
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,870
I'm gonna become the King of the Pirates!

46
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,560
<i>To take down one of the Four Emperors -
the rulers of the New World,</i>

47
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,610
<i>Luffy and the others formed a pirate alliance
with Trafalgar Law</i>

48
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,730
<i>and have come to Dressrosa
to hand Caesar over to Doflamingo.</i>

49
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,110
<i>When Luffy found out that the 
prize for a fighting event</i>

50
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,090

was the Flare-Flare Fruit, he decided to enter.

51
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,010
<i>Meanwhile, Sanji found out that
Caesar's hand-over was Doflamingo's trap and...</i>

52
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,560
Listen carefully!

53
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,120
We've been totally deceived!

54
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:02,350
I have only one purpose, Law.

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,540
I just wanted to kill you!

56
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,630
<i>"Shaking Heaven and Earth!
Admiral Fujitora's Power!"</i>

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,530
Joker! Kick this guy's ass already...

59
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,960
I'm not gonna hand him over to you!

60
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,240
You didn't do anything that I asked you to!

61
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,290
Doflamingo! This deal is off!

62
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,750
No! Wh-What're you talking about, you fool?!
We got this far!

63
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,470
Is that how you talk to your boss
after 10 years of silence?

64
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,690
Leave him, Law.

65
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,610

Caesar is one of my precious subordinates.

66
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,330
Jo...

67
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:19,010
Issho-<i>san</i>, it's Caesar Clown who is with Law.

68
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:19,530
I see. He is the scientist from 
the poison gas incident...

69
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,370
Joker!
I see. He is the scientist from 
the poison gas incident...

70
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,400
I see. He is the scientist from 
the poison gas incident...

71
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,320
But if he is that Warlord's subordinate,
he is not going to get charged.

72
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,380
They'll grant him amnesty.

73
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,600
It's you!

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,190
You are Fujitora, appointed as a Navy admiral
through the World Military Draft.

75
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,190
I hear a lot about you.

76
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,840
They say you're a monster who has 
unquestionable power as well as Ryokugyu.

77
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,290
Oh, why thank you.

78
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,810
Don't play dumb.

79
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,420
I'm still new to the Navy so
it's hard for me to

80
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,320
understand what you're doing.

81
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,160
I don't have enough evidence yet

82
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,720
but I have some information about

83
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,110
you doing things that go against 
the rules of the Seven Warlords.

84
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,720
The man right there was calling you "Joker" -
is that your nickname?

85
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,840
If you want to investigate me,

86
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,390
you have to be really determined 
and collect enough evidence.

87
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,370
Now, what's the Navy's decision
about Law's punishment?

88
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,480
Regarding the news about you and
the wanted pirates, the Straw Hats,

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,310
if you're allying with them as they say in the news,
you're guilty!

90
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,930
If they have become your subordinates,
Law-<i>san</i>, you're...

91
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,050
...not guilty!

92
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,620
Our mission depends on your response.

93
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:09,240
We may have to arrest you and the Straw Hats.

94
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,550
H-Hey, what kind of decision is that?!
He can just get away by lying!

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,600
<i>My original plan failed completely.
The Navy is targeting us now.</i>

96
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,690
<i>Even if I lie now and try to 
take this matter to Dressrosa,</i>

97
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,830

it only makes it worse.

98
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,630
<i>I have to buy some time.</i>

99
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,970
The Straw Hats are not working under me!
We're allies as you read in the paper!

100
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,740
You're such a clumsy man!

101
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,060
Then, we have to strip you of your title.

102
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,730
It'd be nice if the story ended there but...

103
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,710
No way!

104
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,560
Is it a meteorite?!

105
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,550
-D-Don't be ridiculous!

106
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,020
You've got to be kidding!

107
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,520
Run!

108
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,460
A meteorite is coming toward us!

109
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,900
Room!

110
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,500
I-I can't believe it.

111
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,540
Where's Issho-<i>san</i>?

112
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,960
What?! What happened in that moment?!

113
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,620
Only those three spots that they're standing
have no damage!

114
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,620
Issho-<i>san</i>...

115
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,000
How did the Fleet Admiral train you?!
You damn stray dog!

116
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,470
It doesn't matter if he can see or not.

117
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,770
Oh, thank you.
I just wanted to test your skills.

118
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,640
Now, I'm going to arrest you.

119
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,960
Is it okay, Law-<i>san</i>?

120
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:13,890
Don't tell me you're thinking
you can get away from me.

121
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,260
DRESSROSA - FRANKY AND THE OTHERS

122
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,060
<i>The Flower Field?!
Are you gonna go on a picnic?!</i>

123
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,900
<i>What about you?!
Where have you been, Sanji?!</i>

124
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,580
I've been...

125
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,130
...in love!

126
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,750
Oh, that's nice to hear.
By the way, I think I can find the factory.

127
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,970
<i>Really?!</i>

128
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,280
But unfortunately,
we can't just destroy it and get away.

129
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,650
It's gonna be a much bigger task
than we expected.

130
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,030
Hey, wait! We don't allow credit!

131
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,470
Somebody, catch that toy!

132
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,740
He ran away without paying!

133
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,250
Wait!

134
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,800
We don't have time!
Doflamingo was...

135
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,850
Yeah, I just read the extra edition.
He sure fooled us!

136
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,360
If he gets Caesar back,
our entire plan ends in failure!

137
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,510
Let's destroy the factory and
put his nose out of joint!

138
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,580
<i>Anyway, you have to come meet us
at the Flower Field!</i>

139
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,920
Why is the name of that 
place so fairytale-ish?!

140
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,360
<i>By the way, I can't reach Nami-san!</i>

141
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,370
You still see her as weak? 
She's gonna be fine!

142
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,000
Brook and Monster Chopper are with her!

143
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,400
--What is that?
--<i>Huh? What's wrong?</i>

144
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,240
Violet-<i>chan</i>, what is that?

145
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,370
That's a broadcast from the Colosseum.

146
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,240
<i>An unknown gladiator, Lucy, is pretty strong!</i>

147
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,980
--He's quite a fighter!
--Small but tough!

148
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,950
Franky, you won't believe 
this but, Luffy is...

149
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,390
Yeah, he's fighting in a competition now.

150
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,010
Why did you let him?!
You should've kept an eye on him!

151
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:09,170
<i>You're in no place to judge me!
You lost Zoro, didn't you?!</i>

152
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,700
Black Foot, I have to go!

153
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,360
My men are coming after me!

154
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,630
You want to go to the 
secret factory, don't you?

155
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,730

Here is a map.

156
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,280
It's disguised as "Toy House."

157
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,260
But that's the factory.

158
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,560
I can't take this!
If you help me more, you're gonna...

159
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,080
You're a funny man.
It doesn't make any difference.

160
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,560
It seems like the executives 
already know that I betrayed them.

161
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,500
Violet-<i>chan</i>...

162
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,090
The western harbor! Meet me there!

163
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,430
Hide yourself there and 
wait until I get there!

164
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,340

That's our rendezvous point!

165
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,080
I will help you get away 
from here at any price!

166
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,720
You really are a good-for-nothing.

167
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,040
Sorry to interrupt, you good-for-nothing!

168
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,520
You fool! Where did you come from?!

169
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,140
Oh, Violet-<i>chan</i>?!

170
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,280
You have to beat them all up first.

171
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,930
There he is!

172
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,790
What are they doing on the street like this?!

173
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,470
So strong!

174
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,850
Why didn't you do it yourself?

175
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:54,810
I couldn't do anything because they're 
holding Kanjuro as a hostage.

176
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,930
You have to come with me, Sanji-<i>dono</i>!
To the place called Toy House!

177
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,400
That's where they are keeping 
my fellow samurai - Kanjuro!

178
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,980

I don't know where it is, though!

179
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,820
Count on me.

180
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,980
Entering from the general public,
no one really cared about him

181
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,060
but Lucy's doing really well!

182
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,770
Now, who's next?!

183
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,510
Oh, there is a strong 
contender left! Who is it?

184
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,490
The bull from earlier?!

185
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,720
Alright! Do you wanna fight me?!

186
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,540
Oh, now Brutal Bull is facing 
the unstoppable Lucy!

187
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,430
Brutal Bull fought death row prisoners
in this Colosseum the other day!

188
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,260
They will free the one of us who kills it
from death row.

189
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,440
This is a chance that doesn't come twice!

190
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,240
I killed so many tough 
guys before I got caught!

191
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,700
I'm gonna kill this one!

192
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,530
No, I am!

193
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,310
He killed more than half of 
the prisoners in the fight!

194
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,610

He's certainly a killer bull!

195
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,360
The Colosseum's Grim Reaper!

196
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,720

Because of his behavior, people call him Brutal Bull!

197
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,260
He's charging at Lucy!

198
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,180
But Lucy is just standing still!

199
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,080
Did he get paralyzed with fear?!

200
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,640
Brutal Bull stabbed him with his horns...

201
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,050
Hey. I'm here!

202
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,790
L-Lucy fended it off!

203
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,170
I'm over here! Come on!

204
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,120
B-Brutal Bull... s-stopped?!

205
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,490
What did Lucy do? What happened?!

206
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,530
I like you!

207
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Let's do this together!

208
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,010
I-I can't believe it!

209
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,970

He's riding on the Colosseum's Grim Reaper!

210
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,140
What a man! Lucy!

211
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,930
BACK IN GREEN BIT

212
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,570
UNDER THE FOREST

213
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,460
THE TONTATTA KINGDOM

214
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,520
Why is it shaking?

215
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,650
<i>It must be Law and the others.</i>

216
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,550
Damn! I don't wanna die here!

217
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,370
--What?!
--The hero is getting upset!

218
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,650
J-Just kidding.
The truth is the shake was...

219
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,500
...caused by my Haki!

220
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,820
Haki?! Isn't that the technique that

221
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,830
you used to kick 50 thousand villains' 
asses on the Fish-Man Island?!

222
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,510
That's our hero!

223
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,350
Your energy can shake up this kingdom!

224
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,030
Please, please eat this!

225
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,220
It's a Fighting Fish.
It's big and a close relative of the goldfish.

226
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,990
--A Fighting Fish?!
--Yes!

227
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,410
It's good!
I didn't expect it to taste this good!

228
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,230
It tastes like the sea monster 
that I killed easily.

229
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,970
<i>As I thought,</i>

230
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,790
<i>they're the ones who 
caught the Fighting Fish.</i>

231
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,540
<i>How could they do that?
These Little People are that strong?</i>

232
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,370
It's pretty big so it's several-months' worth of food
for everyone in this kingdom.

233
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,810
Usoland, you're a Big Human
so I guess you can eat a lot.

234
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,610
Luffyland who belongs to my 
fighting force - the Usolanders,

235
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,610

can eat the whole fish with one bite!

236
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,780
What's an Usoland?

237
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,460
Look. Doesn't that look familiar?

238
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,640
He's from the picture book 
that we read in Jaya.

239
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,330
NOLAND THE LIAR

240
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,270
Is that a statue of Mont Blanc Noland?!

241
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,700
Yes, it is!

242
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,350
You know him, too, of course, don't you?

243
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,010
He was a Big Human botanist who came 
visit this kingdom 400 years ago.

244
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,720
At that time, our ancestors 
were having a hard time

245
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,020
because the villainous Big Humans
were messing up this island.

246
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,920
And he fought with our ancestors
and led them to victory

247
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,840
so he became the legendary hero of
the Tontatta Kingdom!

248
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,560
When Usoland said his name
and told us that he's one of his descendants,

249
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,350
I was speechless!

250
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:46,820
L-Look at my head!

251
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,840
This chestnut-like head is the proof!

252
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,220
--Oh yeah!
--The chestnut-like head!

253
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,130
I didn't have any idea! I'm so sorry!

254
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,910
You're a horrible person.

255
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,570
You were saved by it, too!

256
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,140
Let's eat and get some gifts and go!

257
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,590
But this must be destiny.

258
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,370
To see them today.

259
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,560
Indeed!

260
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:19,270
Today is the day we vowed to fight 
Doflamingo and after 400 years,

261
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,220
and a legendary hero came along again!

262
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:28,440
Usoland! After you finish eating,
let's go to the Flower Field via underground passage!

263
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,310
Let's go!

264
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,710
Yeah!

265
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,650
At Dressrosa where we're gonna fight,

266
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:39,490
the commander and our fellow soldiers of
the King Riku Army are expecting us!

267
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,640
Yeah!

268
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,890
Please stand at the forefront and lead us!

269
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,030
Let's destroy the Don Quixote Family!

270
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,900
Yeah!

271
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,600
With Usoland, we're unbreakable!

272
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,900
Yeah!

273
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,810
Our hero!

274
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:04,550
Usoland! Usoland! Usoland! Usoland! Usoland!

275
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,050
<i>Usoland?!</i>
