-Jesus.

765
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,300
- It's crawling with criminal ass germs.
- [ Retching ]

766
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,303
- [ Linus ] Just hover, man.
- Okay, listen up, pre-pubes.

767
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,307
You got a visitor-
Sweet can of corn.

768
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,209
What are you doing with that ham sandwich,
boy? It's not right what you're doing.

769
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,713
[ Windows ]
Hutch,you owe me a sock.

770
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,773
I had to wipe with something.

771
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:37,787
You pussies owe me, big time.

772
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:41,450
- Oh, Zoe, thank God.
- We weren't sure if you'd gotten our message.

773
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:45,985
If by message you mean Windows shrieking
into my answering machine like a little girl...

774
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,554
- then yes, message received.
- [ Windows ] You don't know
what we've been through.

775
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:51,328
Hutch just took a dump in front of us.

776
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,633
[ Sniffs ]
Yeah. That's life inside the big house.

777
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:57,105
Zoe, promise me you brought the money.

778
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,165
I cleared out every cent
Windows had in the comic store.

779
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,837
- You what?
- Oh! Don't even speak.

780
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:05,541
I took two taxis, an airplane
and an all-night bus ride...

781
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:08,949
next to an old man that I am
pretty sure had a full diaper.

782
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,487
Hey, hey, okay.
Okay, visiting time's over.

783
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,581
The judge wants to see y'all
in his private chambers.

784
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:17,024
Oh, yeah.
Just one more thing.

785
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,120
Whatever you do,
do not make fun of his name.

786
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:23,223
Let me see if I got this right.

787
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,530
Now, you tried to outrun
an officer of the law...

788
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,436
because you obtained a bag of peyote
from a Mexican Indian chief...

789
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:33,272
who thought it would help
treat your friend's terminal illness?

790
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,505
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

791
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,776
- I'm gonna let you boys go.
- [ All Sigh ]

792
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,477
- Not because I believe you.
- [ Laughing ]

793
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:44,453
- Because I believe your father.
- My father?

794
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,285
- Mm-hmm.
- You actually spoke with my dad?

795
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,848
Sure did.

796
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,554
He wanted me to give you this message.

797
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,119
Approach the bench.

798
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,065
Have a nice day, son.

799
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:11,804
Yeah. Man's gone
carbonite freeze on us.

800
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,817
[ Hutch ] We got to be in Vegas
in less than 2 4 hours.

801
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:18,548
All right. I'm gonna go smack
some sense into the boy.

802
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:20,647
Whoa. Cut him some slack.

803
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,521
[ Windows ]
Okay.

804
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:26,791
I just mapped out our route to Vegas
on my Toughbook...

805
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:29,731
and the closest airport's
about a hundred miles north of here.

806
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,928
So all we got to do
is drop the ol' Zoe off...

807
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,028
and then it's a straight shot
to Sin City.

808
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:37,539
Ho! Hold on.

809
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,906
You haul my ass
out into the middle of nowhere...

810
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,411
and expect me to just jump
on the first plane back?

811
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,379
[ Laughs ]
Sorry. It's not gonna happen.

812
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,507
Come on. You know this trip is men only.

813
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,210
I tell you what.

814
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:52,745
I'll get on the plane
if any one of you can take me down.

815
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,155
Listen, Princess.

816
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:58,058
No one wants to see you get hurt.

817

- Get her off of me!

- And be nice.

You're lucky I have a crush on you.

Yo, Botts, you okay?

830
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:44,168
You know, I could do this-
start a life here.

831
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,210
Clean slate.
Fresh air.

832
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,269
No pressure, no responsibility.

833
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:53,111
[ Linus ]
Yeah, it seems nice, man.

834
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:56,812
In theory it sounds nice.

835
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:04,390
I bet there's not even like a Blockbuster Video
within 500 miles of here.

836
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,452
Or like a Falafel Hut or-

Guys, shut up.

838
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,695
I just figured if I...

00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,070
worked hard and...

840
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,871
sold enough cars and impressed my dad
enough times, I'd-

841
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,814
I'd feel something.

842
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:28,511
You gotta find your Death Star.

Okay, I'll bite.

Greatest deed Luke Skywalker ever did...

00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,223
was take down the Death Star, right?

846
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,731
As far as I'm concerned,
that's what everybody needs.

847
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,633
You need that one bad-ass thing...

I'm 2 4 years old...

and I've only ever copulated
with one woman.

only been with one woman.
