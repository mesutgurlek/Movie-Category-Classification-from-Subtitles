- Thank you, Bryant.

48
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:13,505
For years, you were told

by Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne

50

that the world had ended.

51

Yes, Reverend Richard told us

52
00:02:19,094 --> 00:02:20,846
that there had been a nuclear apocalypse

53
00:02:20,929 --> 00:02:22,347
and that the Earth was scorched

forced into this cult.

at a York Steak House I worked at,

60
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:35,294

61
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:37,004
to see some baby rabbits.

62
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:39,090

here we are.

64
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,386
I'm always amazed at what women will do

65
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:44,763

00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:13,758
- or two recent pay stumps?
- No and no.

166
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:16,177
- Where do you work?
- Nowhere yet.

167
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:17,887
I pronounce you ridiculous.

168
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,639
Come back when you got a J-O-B!

169
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:24,185
He's right. I am gonna need a job.

170
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:26,687
Honey, you come back here with a job,

171
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:29,396
- the place is yours.
- Thanks.

172
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:30,797
Yeah. Oh!

173
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:32,944
But don't wear that yellow sweater,

174
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:35,280
'cause the Crips'll think
you're in the Banana Boys.

175
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:36,906
It's a new gang.

176
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:38,574
There weren't any good colors left.

177
00:08:38,657 --> 00:08:40,910
Nice to meet ya!

178
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,957
Hi, I'm Kimmy.

179
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,251
I'm a big fan of your products,

180
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:50,253
particularly the shark gummies,

181
00:08:50,336 --> 00:08:52,421
which I hadn't seen elsewhere.

182
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:56,383
And I'm interested
in any employment opportunities

183
00:08:56,467 --> 00:09:02,056

186
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:17,529
Thank God. Are you the dog masseuse?

187
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:19,198
No. Ma'am, I found your son.

188
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:21,826
Buckley? Where's Hunong?

189
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,329
She never picked me up,
so I was just walking home.

190
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:25,454
Liar!

191
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:26,872
I'm sorry. And you work for the school?

192
00:09:26,956 --> 00:09:28,374
- No.
- So you're an Uber driver.

193
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:30,542
- No.
- So you are the dog masseuse?

194
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,378
Ma'am, I'm a stranger.

195
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:33,879
Buckley, please get in here.

196
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:35,631
You know I'm not allowed outside.

197
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:40,052
Okay.

198
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:42,805
Ma'am, what do you mean,
you're not allowed outside?

199
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:45,641
- I had a face peel.
- Is that your reverend?

200
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:49,687
- Did he peel your face?
- I'm sorry?

201
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,147
Do you need help?

202
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:56,194
Answer me honestly. Do you need help?

203
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:59,530
I do.

204
00:09:59,613 --> 00:10:02,241
It's $17 an hour cash, under the table.

205
00:10:02,325 --> 00:10:05,036
You'll need to sign an NDA and a DNR.

206
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:06,704
Do you get sick in helicopters?

207
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:08,247
I never have.

208
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:09,707
You'll need to be here by 6:00 every morning

209
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,292
to get Buckley up for school.

210
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:13,211
Then get me up at 10:00,
but don't wake me up.

211
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:14,545
Can I just say how grateful I am

212
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:15,880
for this opportunity?

213
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:17,548
I'm sorry. What is your name?

214
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:18,966
- Oh, it's Kimmy.
- Kimmy.

215
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,385
Are you good at braiding hair?

216
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:22,761
- I'm awesome at it.
- Fantastic.

217
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:24,930
Of course, you'll have to meet
the horses first.

218
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:27,567
Do you want a water?
- No, thanks.

219
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:28,850
- Okay.

220
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:30,353
This is Charles. He's a tutor.

221
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:32,146
He'll help you do Buckley's homework.

222
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,023
Also, it's Buckley's birthday tomorrow,

223
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:35,441
so you'll need to make a cake that's cute

224
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:37,109
but also paleo.

225
00:10:37,193 --> 00:10:39,111
Swedish, 90 minutes, medium pressure.

226
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:40,321
I'm going to bed.

227
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:45,993
What in the ham sandwich? I just got a job.

228
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:47,494
Please tell me that you're normal.

229
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:48,996
I need someone here to talk to.

230
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,539
Oh, I'm very normal.

231
00:10:50,622 --> 00:10:52,833
I've had everything normal happen to me.

232
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,294
What?

233
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:57,588
Lillian, why is my
doll furniture on the curb?

234
00:10:57,671 --> 00:11:00,132
Because it's all I could carry.

235
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:04,387
Tomorrow real movers come,
Titus, and evict you.

236
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,972
- How dare you?
- You know I love you.

237
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:08,807
Lillian, I helped you take a shower once.

238
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:09,975
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, white weirdo.

239
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:11,394
I got a job.

240
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:13,687
It pays $17 an hour, under the tables,

241
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:16,857
but I can pay in advance right now

242
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:18,859
with my... tax refund.

243
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:20,111
I can have his things out by tonight.

[clears throat]
Lillian.

245
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:23,406
I have decided I will be
taking a roommate.

246
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:24,740
Oh, you have decided, have you?

247
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:26,325
Yes, I've decided.

248
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:28,453
Well, I'm the one that placed the ad...

249
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:30,913
Actually, I would rather live with someone.

250
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:32,290
I'm kind of used to having roommates.

251
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:36,252
- Okay. J'approuve.
- [gasps]

252
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:37,628
When will I be getting my money?

253
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:38,796
What about my money?

254
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,425
- Slavery reparations, Lillian.
- Touché.

255
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:44,927
You people have suffered.

256

Is that a real robot?

Do people have robots now?

- What?
- Huh?

260

That's my bedroom.

261
00:11:57,606 --> 00:12:00,067
You'll be staying in my office.

262
00:12:00,151 --> 00:12:03,737
Ha! I will be very comfortable in here.

263
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:05,948
It's like two Cyndees by a Gretchen.

264

[gasps] A window. My own window!

[gasps] And it has this.

266
00:12:28,429 --> 00:12:30,097
Where's the rest of your stuff?

267
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:31,932
Oh, this is it.

268
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:34,143
- You got a secret.
- What?

269
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:36,812
You moved to New York City
today with a bag full of cash,

270
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:38,772
no stuff, and what is clearly a wig.

271
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:41,442
Somebody in here got beans. Spill them.

00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:43,902
Okay.

273
00:12:43,986 --> 00:12:47,239
Well, the truth is, I'm from Indiana...

274
00:12:47,323 --> 00:12:48,824
Oh, okay.

275
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:49,992
That explains why you're so basic.

276
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:51,035
Say no more.

277
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:54,205
So let's get this dirty
rent business out of the way.

[clears throat]

279
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:02,004
As you know, we owe Lillian
two months' back rent,

280
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:04,923
so that's $950.

281
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,260
Plus this upcoming month.

282
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:14,683
And, of course, there's a
one-month security deposit.

283
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:21,607
Also, ever since you moved
in, this lamp stopped working.

284
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,943
[switch clicking] So that's another $100.

285
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:26,571
Nice try, Titus.

286
00:13:26,653 --> 00:13:27,738
There's no light bulb in there.

You got me! You are so very cosmopolitan.

288
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:34,661
So what do you want to do tonight?

289
00:13:34,745 --> 00:13:37,789
Honestly, listen to Diana Ross albums alone

290
00:13:37,873 --> 00:13:39,708
while I do my stretches
to alleviate my gas.

We should go out to celebrate.

292
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:42,503
I mean, I got a job today.

293
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:46,591
I got an apartment. I met you. I envy you.

00:13:46,673 --> 00:13:48,175
I've never been able to meet me.

295
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:50,261
Come on, we should go
dancing someplace cool,

296
00:13:50,344 --> 00:13:52,304
like Club Bombay from Moesha.

297

Whoo! Things are behind in Indiana.

298
00:13:56,975 --> 00:13:58,603
I'll pay for everything.

I came here in 1998 on a damn bus

366
00:17:53,003 --> 00:17:54,839
from Chickasaw County, Mississippi.

367

You know who leaves Chickasaw County?

368

Nobody.

Have you ever met a

I was cute, just like you.

Showed my teeth when I
smiled, just like you.

375
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:14,859
I changed my name to Titus Andromedon,

376
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:17,027
and I marched myself in to
audition for The Lion King.

377
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,904
You were in The Lion King on Broadway?

378
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:21,114
Yes, except I was not.

379
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:24,785
I auditioned for The Lion
King 20 times in 15 years

380
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:26,286
until they finally told me,

"You are not passing
as a straight giraffe."

But you are such a good
singer. I heard you.

00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:41,089
My boss is 17 years old,
I get paid in quarters,

to my good friend God earlier.

We were talking about why
he allowed his creation

to be destroyed,

That we're all dumb and bad
