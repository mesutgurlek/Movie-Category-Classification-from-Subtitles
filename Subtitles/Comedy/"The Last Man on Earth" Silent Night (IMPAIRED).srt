Hey, little guy.

I'm Mike, Mike Miller.

(groaning)

18
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:03,805
Okay, it-it says here

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,440
it could be appendicitis,

20
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:07,241
but it could be just gas.

21
00:01:07,277 --> 00:01:08,743
(groaning): It isn't gas.

22
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:11,412
Well, we need to do our due diligence here.

23
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:13,514
Will you try to blow out a fart for me?

24
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,316
Hey, bud, how about a real quick fart?

25
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:16,417
Just anything you got.

26
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:17,785
(growling): It isn't gas.

27
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:18,920
Okay, you don't have to get upset.

28
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:20,421
He's in pain.

29
00:01:20,457 --> 00:01:22,824
Well, I am just running
through the checklist here.

30
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:24,559
I don't see any of you chuckleheads

31
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:25,960
doing anything to help.

32
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:27,862
Maybe we should get him
some flat ginger ale?

33
00:01:27,897 --> 00:01:29,731
Carol, come on, flat
ginger ale makes you fart?!

34
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:31,032
We need to focus here.

35
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,900
We're talking beans,
we're talking broccoli.

36
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:34,602
Anything in the cabbage family.

37
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,471
- Ginger ale sounds good.
- Uh, Carol,

38
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:38,473
- what's the ETA on that ginger ale?
- Okay.

39
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:40,308
- Okay, should we elevate his feet a little bit?
- (screaming)

40
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:42,410
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- No!

41
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:45,480
- Gail, what about aspirin?
- Uh, I-I don't know.

42
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:46,981
- I don't know.
- Vicodin.

43
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:48,049
- Vicodin?
- Oh, yeah, we've got Vicodin.

44
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:49,150
- Vicodin!
- I have Vicodin in my room.

45

- PHIL 2: Ow.
- Here, take my hand, braheem.

46
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:52,387
- Ow!
- Aah, nobody touch his hands!

47
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:53,654
Gail, do something!

48
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,323
I'm not a freakin' doctor!

49
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:58,726
I am just a chef from
a three-star restaurant

51
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:02,430
so shut your friggin' cake holes!

52
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:07,735
Suge, I am really gonna need
you to blow a fart out for me.

53
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:11,873
Hey, uh, I don't know.

54
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:14,108
Should we talk about the, uh,
you know, the proposal or... ?

55
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,377
Uh, Todd, we have bigger fish to fry.

56
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:18,479
Help me look for these pills.

57
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,449
Yeah, I-I know, I just...

58
00:02:21,484 --> 00:02:22,683
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

59
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,453
Why wouldn't I be?

60
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:27,121
Just know I never meant to hurt you.

61
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:30,358
Oh.

62
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:32,260
So it's a no?

63
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:36,330
Uh, y... you didn't hear?

64
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:39,767
No, that... that's fine though.

65
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:41,903
Um, yeah, uh, I just kind
of threw it out there.

66
00:02:41,938 --> 00:02:44,372
I was... I-I was expecting a no,

67
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,741
so it's not a... real big deal.

68
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:48,276
Either way.

69
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:52,747
You sure?

70
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,449
Totally.

71
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:55,850
You're awesome.

72
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:58,052
- <i>You're</i> awesome.
- Yeah, you are.

73
00:02:58,088 --> 00:02:59,987
- (Phil 2 groans)
- Uh, go, go, go, go.

74
00:03:00,023 --> 00:03:01,556
Take these to Phil, I'll
keep looking for more.

75
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:03,791
Okay.

76
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:06,427
GAIL: Okay, so the symptoms of appendicitis

77
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:09,897
are lower right-side abdominal
pain, nausea, diarrhea,

78
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:12,400
inability to pass gas, fever,

79
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:13,868
a sense that you might feel better

80
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:14,969
after passing stool.

81
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:17,705
Do any of these apply to you?

82
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,807
It's appendicitis.

83
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:22,710
Okay, so what are our options?

84
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:25,379
We really only have one.

85
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:27,048
Somebody's got to take it out.

86
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,051
What happens if we don't take it out?

87
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:34,722
It says here, "Failure to
remove a ruptured appendix

88
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:38,459
results in death," like, a
hundred percent of the time.

89
00:03:38,495 --> 00:03:40,628
I am not liking those odds, guys.

90
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:41,729
Take it out.

91
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:46,400
I guess this one falls
to our ersatz doctor.

92
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,936
(chanting): Gail, Gail, Gail, Gail.

93
00:03:48,972 --> 00:03:51,806
Stop it, Tandy, I'm not a doctor.

94
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:53,107
And the Wright brothers weren't pilots

95
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:54,976
until they got into that plane, you know?

96
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:56,544

97
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,713
Gail, Gail, Gail...

98
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,114
Gail.

99
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,517
- ERICA: Gail.
- PHIL 2: Gail. Take it out, Gail.

100
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:05,987
- (knocking on door)
- Ugh, go away.

101
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:07,822
Doctor is not in.

102
00:04:11,494 --> 00:04:12,560
Gail.

103
00:04:16,432 --> 00:04:18,666
You have to do this.

104
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,335
Erica, you know perfectly well

105
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,505
that I never claimed to be a doctor.

106
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:28,009
Yes, I'm good for a couple
of stitches or some basic CPR,

107
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:29,877
but surgery?

108
00:04:29,913 --> 00:04:32,747
That is a giant hell to the no.

109
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:33,948
Not happening.

110
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,216
Unsubscribe.

111
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,685
Phil's gonna die if we don't do something.

112
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,788
Look, Erica, let's just face reality.

113
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:43,157
No one here can fix him.

114
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:45,126
We've all been through this before.

115
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:46,594
We know the drill.

116
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:49,664
Let's just give him some kick-ass drugs

117
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,899
and send him off with a smile.

118
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:54,602
Gail, he's the father of my child.

119
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:03,844
I'll give it a shot.

120
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,947
Thank you.

121
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:13,955
Look, Gail, I know you're scared...

122
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,623
I'm gonna do it, Tandy.

123
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,993
(blows twice)

124
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,628
And that's how you do that.

125
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,932
Idiot.

126
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:31,512
I can't believe I didn't see you.

127
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:35,817
Right there under my nose,
and I just totally missed you.

128
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:37,585
(chuckles)

129
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:41,089
I just missed you.

130
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:43,257
You were there all along.

131
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:51,199
Hey.

132
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:53,368
All right, we got to come
up with a name for you, huh?

133
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:55,803
How about Wormsley? Wormifer?

134
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,839
Dennis Rodman.

135
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:59,107
You know?

136
00:05:59,142 --> 00:06:01,009
You get that reference?

137
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:02,777
His nickname was "The Worm."

138
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:08,649
Actually, I say we go
with something classic.

139
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,556

140
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,729
Hey, bud.

141
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:23,731
I brought you a card.

142
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,401
Don't read it, it's for your 50th.

143
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:29,037
Which is happening above
ground, you hear me?

144
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,539
I'm gonna tuck it in here.

145

Let's see how you're doing.

146
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:37,011
Pulse feels good.

147
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:38,880
Tandy, just let him rest.

148
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:41,549
I will. But not in peace.

149
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:43,451
But I need you to promise me

150
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,087
that we are gonna sit
down and laugh about this

151
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:48,156
when we are old and gray. Okay?

152
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:50,758
Or when I'm gray and
when your pubes are gray.

153
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:54,595
Don't worry, little guy.

154
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,564
You'll meet your father.

155

You son of a bitch appendix!

156
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:00,501
Okay, we're gonna make
sure we get your sorry ass

157
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:02,136
out of that body, okay?

158

I'm so sorry you had to
hear that, sweet baby.

160
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:11,679
Okay? But when you come out,
it's gonna be nice and smooth.

161
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:13,781
Your dad will not be

And that's that you always bet on black.

165
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:22,757
Props to my friend Wesley Snipes for that.

166
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:26,928
- Get out of here, Tandy.
- Okay.

167
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:29,097
- I'll go.
- Yeah.

168
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:33,134
But I'm not saying good-bye.

169
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:36,037
CAROL: (sighs) <i>Okay, just grab</i>

170
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:37,772
anything and everything,

171
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:40,975
'cause you never know what Gail might need.

172
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,712
This day is a real stinkerooni.

173
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:46,447
I don't want to say Phil ruined Christmas,

174
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,583
but he might have ruined Christmas, and...

175
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:50,118
(grunts)

176
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:51,752
Melissa, you missed the bag.

177
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:55,523
(crying)

178
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,925
Are you all right?

179
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:59,660
- No.
- Oh, no.

180
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,596
What is it? Come here. What is it?

181
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:04,699
- (gasps) Are you crying?
- Oh, God.

182
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,700
No. I'm sorry.

183
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,836
Goll almighty, get in here, lady.

184
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:10,605
(gasps) Oh.

185
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,241
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

186
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:15,443
Melissa, you're finally

187
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:18,212
opening up, and I'm so proud of you.

188
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,282
But I'm gonna need you to
shut it right back down, lady.

189
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:22,817
Phil needs us.

190
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:24,352
So just box that up,

191
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,687
we'll go save his life,
and then we'll come back

192
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:28,789
and dig into those delicious feelings.

193
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:31,425
It's what I like to call
an emotional doggy bag.

194
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,996
And they taste even better the next day.

195
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:37,165
Okay.

196
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,634
All right, let's go!

197
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,070
Okay, it says here the initial
incision should be two inches,

198
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,140
five millimeters deep.

199
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:48,976
Damn it.

200
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:52,613
It's okay. (chuckles) Your next patient.

201
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:57,251
Do you, um,

202
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,787
think you should go be with Melissa?

203
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:02,924
No, I-I think we should focus on this.

204
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,859
Unless you want me to leave.

205
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:06,761
No.

206
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,330
Please stay.

207
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,201
Okay. (exhales)

208
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:15,303
Now we're cookin'.

209
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:18,005
Okay. Now take the 6B clamps

210
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:21,075
and open the incision.

211
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,077
Damn it.

212
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:26,347
All right. Toss me another
one of those hand pies, Todd.

213
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:28,282
You got it.

214
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:32,086
Oop, looks like someone,
uh, lost another pie-tient.

215
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:33,788
(chuckles) Boom.

216
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,057
But in all seriousness, Gail,

217
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,825
is there anything I can do to help?

218
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:43,097
There is one thing you
guys could get for me.

219
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:45,533
All right. Well, let's just, uh,

220
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:47,268
you know, open a drawer, pick a bod,

221
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:48,869
and get the hell out of here.

222
00:09:48,905 --> 00:09:50,171
I think they're called lockers.

223
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:51,672
Eh, I said that with such confidence.

224
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,840
Honestly, I have no idea.

225
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,008
No, no, no. That's fine.

226
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:55,276
We'll just call 'em body lockers.

227
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:57,044
We'll know what we're talking about, right?

228
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,646
I was in a hip-hop dance group in college

229
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,647
called the Body Lockers.

230
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,915
Very funny, Todd.

231
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,583
No, that's-that's true. I was.

232
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:05,953
- Shut the front door. What?
- Yeah.

233
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:08,322
We were good, too. Yeah.
We-we had some paid gigs.

234
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,259
We did a show for State
Senator Tom Scofield.

235
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:12,860
Scofield. No crap.

236
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:15,096
- You know, we got to focus here.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

237
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:17,265
Yeah. Okay.

238
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,967
Do a couple moves.

239
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:21,636
(chuckles)

240
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:22,737
Cool, all right. I have...

241
00:10:22,772 --> 00:10:23,771
Let's see, I'm a little rusty,

242
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:25,806
but I think I can do a little...

243
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,375
- You got it... 
- What?

244
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,509
- Give me... give me your flashlight.
- What? Yeah.

245
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:29,910
Here, give me your
light, give me your light.

246
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:30,878
Club atmosphere.

247
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:31,912
I'm just trying to...

248
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:32,880
Club atmosphere.

249
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:34,148
... incorporate it into it, but, I guess...

250
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,349
Oh!

251
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,151
Rolling at the club. I think...

252
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:38,119
Rolling at the club.

253
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:39,186
Bottle full of bub.

254
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,221
(laughs): Nice!

255
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:41,822
- Thanks, man.
- Hey!

256
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,391
- (laughs) Very good.
- Okay.

257
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:44,725
- Let's focus up. Focus up.
- Yeah.

258
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:47,561
Okay, let's open up James McMaster.

259
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:51,866
(sighs): Whew.

260
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,835
James McMaster is more of
a skeleton than a cadaver.

261
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:56,170
Cadaver? I hardly knew her.

262
00:10:56,205 --> 00:10:57,772
Boom.

263
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:00,908
(chuckles) Not really the
appropriate time for that.

264
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:01,909
Okay.

265
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,880
Okay, let's see what is under

266
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,149
door number...

267
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:09,784
Nope.

268
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:12,720
Okay, God, that looks more
like my nana's junk drawer.

269
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,290
No offense... Tawny Daniels.

270
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:19,493
These poor bodies just did not keep.

271
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:22,963
And Gail needs something she
can really practice on, you know?

272
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:25,633
I think she needs a pancake
that's a little fresher

273
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:27,668
off the griddle, if you
know what I'm saying.

274
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:28,936
Tandy, you better not be thinking

275
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:30,271
what I think you're thinking.

276
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,307
Sorry, Gordon.

277
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:40,987
(sighs)

278
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:44,492
Ugh!

279
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,928
Think I need some of that Clarice Starling

280
00:11:46,963 --> 00:11:48,896
under-the-nose cream.

281
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:50,331
(grunts)

282
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:52,400
Oh! Oh! I think I hit something.

283
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:55,136
Oh, yeah, that feels like skull.

284
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:56,771
Oh, yeah, and there's some neck

285
00:11:56,806 --> 00:11:57,905
and ribs.

286
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:59,440
Don't worry, Gordon, I'm not gonna come

287
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:01,042
anywhere near those balls.

288
00:12:01,077 --> 00:12:02,110
Hey, Todd, come on.

289
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:04,112
I need your help, man. Get in here.

290
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:05,780
You know, Tandy, I don't think I can, man.

291
00:12:05,815 --> 00:12:07,482
This isn't like the morgue.
I mean, I knew this guy.

292
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:09,250
This is Gordon, man.

293
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:11,419
I know this is hard, but Gordon's dead,

294
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:13,988
and there's nothing we can
do to bring him back to life.

295
00:12:14,023 --> 00:12:15,223
Okay.

296
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:17,992
Yeah, get down here.

297
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:19,961
(sobbing softly)

298
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,896
Sorry, Tandy, I can't, man.

299
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:23,097
Suck it up, Todd!

300
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,365
I can't, man!

301
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:26,300
(crying): I'm spinning out!

302
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:28,536
There's just all this stuff, you know?

303
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:31,906
Break up with Melissa, Phil's getting sick,

304
00:12:31,941 --> 00:12:34,776
I'm having sex with Gail,
and now I'm digging up Gordon.

305
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:36,010
I can't, man. I just can't.

306
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:37,345
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up.

307
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,880
You're having sex with Gail?

308
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:40,148
(sniffles) Yes.

309
00:12:40,183 --> 00:12:44,085
Three times. We did it once, and
then we did it two more times.

310
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,987
- Does Melissa know?
- Are you kidding me?!

311
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:47,989
No!

312
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,957
I went straight from
breaking up with Melissa

313
00:12:49,993 --> 00:12:51,359
to laying with Gail.

314
00:12:51,394 --> 00:12:54,162
And now I'm digging up her ex.

315
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:56,431
Sorry, Gordo, man!

316
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:58,399
I'm out of control, brother!

317
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:01,002
You're having sex with Gail and Melissa?

318
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:02,537
You dirty dog.

319
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:04,205
Hey, up top, man.

320
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,807
You're missing the point, Tandy!

321
00:13:05,842 --> 00:13:08,443
This is the straw that
broke the camel's back!

322
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:11,112
The camel is dead, and I ate it!

323
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:12,413
Just like the bacon!

324
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:13,881
- Todd! Todd!
- Which is another thing I did!

325
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:16,050
- Todd! Get ahold of yourself, man!
- (sobbing)

326
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:17,919
Hey, hey! Okay?

327
00:13:17,954 --> 00:13:18,953
- Are you finished?
- Yeah.

328
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:20,555
'Cause there's a man up in that house

329
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,123
that needs our help right now.

330
00:13:22,158 --> 00:13:23,491
And if we don't focus,

331
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:26,060
we're gonna be digging another
hole right next to this one.

332
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:27,094
Okay?

333
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,930
So shut your frickin' turd hole

334
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:30,565
and grab your dead buddy's legs.

335
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,533
Come on! Okay.

336
00:13:35,238 --> 00:13:38,473
(both grunting)

337
00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:40,241
(coughs)

338
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:42,043
Oh, this frickin' reeks!

339
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:44,045
(grunting continues)

340
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,047
Take a shower, dude.

341
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:59,894
Gail.

342
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:04,031
Todd and I have something
that Todd wants to tell you.

343
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,733
- I do?
- Yeah.

344
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:11,372
Uh, there was kind of
a hiccup at the morgue,

345
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:13,574
so we had to improvise.

346
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,509
Uh...

347
00:14:14,544 --> 00:14:16,611
the results of which

348
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:20,281
might be slightly upsetting, but...

349
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:21,582
What is that?

350
00:14:21,618 --> 00:14:24,018
Oh.

351
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:26,454
Melissa and Carol found this for me.

352
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:28,456
It's for surgery students.

353
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:31,259
It's got, like, guts and skin

354
00:14:31,294 --> 00:14:34,195
and appendix... every-everything I need.

355
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,364
So you won't be needing a cadaver?

356
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,099
Hardly knew her. Boom.

357
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:39,333
Why, did you find one?

358
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:41,335
No, we did... uh, no, we did not.

359
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:42,670
Uh, not anywhere.

360
00:14:42,705 --> 00:14:45,106
Wait, what did you guys want to tell me?

361
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:47,408
Uh, just that, you know, Todd, uh, was once

362
00:14:47,443 --> 00:14:50,611
in a hip-hop dance group
called The Body Lockers.

363
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:01,355
(whispers): Yeah.

364
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:02,557
Why would that upset me?

365
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,691
I think that's beautiful.

366
00:15:03,726 --> 00:15:05,426
- Oh.
- When I look at it this time,

367
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:06,794
it doesn't upset me.

368
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:08,329
It's like, I don't know
what I was thinking.

369
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:09,997
- 'Cause it's great.
- Thanks, Tandy.

370
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,309
(both grunting)

371
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,152
ERICA: Hey.

372
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:32,320
Don't worry, okay?

373
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:35,189
It's gonna work. Gail's been practicing.

374
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:42,196
I'm sorry for how things
went down between us.

375
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,598
Don't apologize.

376
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:44,999
You didn't do anything wrong.

377
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:47,635
You were just saying how you felt.

378
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,371
Besides, we can talk about
all this when you're better.

379
00:15:50,406 --> 00:15:53,307
When I'm better.

380
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,709
Hey, buddy.

381
00:15:54,744 --> 00:15:56,377
I found a medicine you can't buy.

382
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:58,613
It's called laughter. Oh!

383
00:15:58,648 --> 00:16:02,450
JK. (chuckles)

384
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:04,318
How's it looking, huh?

385
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:07,221
He's in a lot of pain, Tandy.

386
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:09,190
(sighs)

387
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:11,459
(mutters): Can you come here?
I want to ask you something.

388
00:16:11,494 --> 00:16:14,228
Sorry, I can't hear you.
Permission to buzz the tower?

389
00:16:14,263 --> 00:16:16,597
(mutters): Can you get me some water?

390
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:20,368
You want me to be the father

391
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:22,603
of your unborn child?

392
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,438
(quick exhale)

393
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:27,475
(laughs)

394
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,744
Can you get me some water?

395
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:32,480
Oh, water. Yes.

396
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:36,017
That's what I thought you said.

397
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:37,718
I will get the water.

398
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:39,553
Yeah. Yeah.

399
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:42,590
(chuckles) Wa...

400
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:45,626
Water coming up. Happy to...

401
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:47,595
(chuckles)

402
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,597
Friggin' bag.

403
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:53,200
(chuckles) Laughter.

404
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:54,535
MIKE: <i>Oh, come on, you don't
think I've thought of this,</i>

405
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,436
<i>like, a million times?</i>

406
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:57,738
No, I-I'm...

407
00:16:57,774 --> 00:17:00,374
No, I'm telling you it's impossible, okay?

408
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,109
Yes, it is.

409
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:05,312
Come on, there's no mission
control, there's no nothing.

410
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:07,348
There's no way we can do it.

411
00:17:07,383 --> 00:17:09,717
It's impossible.

412
00:17:09,752 --> 00:17:11,619
You don't know

413
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:13,654
what you're talking about.

414
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,625
I know time is running out.

415
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,760
But I'm scared.

416
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:28,558
_

417
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:34,508
(loud groaning)

418
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:37,244
Oh, that don't look right.

419
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,647
Okay, back to the drawing board.

420
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:42,783
Gail, we got to do this.

421
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:45,519
Okay, I-I just need one more dry run.

422
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:46,754
Just-just one sec.

423
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,622
No, it's got to be now, Gail.

424
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:50,257
Okay, I'm... You know what, I'm gonna take

425
00:17:50,293 --> 00:17:53,227
a quick smoke break and then
we're gonna go right to it.

426
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:54,762
(groans) Gail.

427
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:56,297
Oh,

428
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:58,399
Phil. Oh, my God.

429
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:01,402
Oh, my God, Phil!

430
00:18:01,437 --> 00:18:03,471
Oh, farts.

431
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,947
(beeps)

432
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:13,884
You ready, Phil?

433
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,285
I'll take that as a yes.

434
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:18,655
What do you say we take this
baby out on the open road, huh,

435
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:20,991
and, uh, we'll see what she can do.

436
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:25,062
Okay...

437
00:18:25,097 --> 00:18:26,230
here goes nothing.

438
00:18:26,265 --> 00:18:27,598
(engine whirrs)

439
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:29,333
COMPUTER VOICE: Separation
sequence initiating.

440
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:32,302
- (monitor beeps rhythmically)
- Okay, Todd, we're doing this.

441
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:34,538
Phil, do you have enough pills

442
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:37,141
in you, honey? Are you feeling any pain?

443
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:40,911
I want you to know I'm gonna
do the very best I can, okay?

444
00:18:40,946 --> 00:18:43,155
Although I am not a doctor...

445
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,256
I probably shouldn't say that.

446
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:45,858
It's okay.

447
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:56,735
Okay.

448
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:00,272
Here we go.

449
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,407
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

450
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:06,211
Oh, I can't.

451
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:07,713
- I... 
- Gail.

452
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:14,052
Just like we practiced, okay?

453
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:16,054
Okay.

454
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,293
(computer beeping, engine humming)

455
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,394
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

456
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:25,130
Okay, hand me the clampy thing.

457
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,799
Okay. No, no, the, the, bigger one.

458
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:27,900
Okay. Yeah.

459
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:31,303
Okay.

460
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:34,373
(alarm beeping, engine rumbling)

461
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:35,908
- I found it.
- Found it? Yeah?

462
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:38,043
- I think I feel it. Okay.
- Oh, good. Okay.

463
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:39,244
Hard to see.

464
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,013
- We just got to cut it out.
- Yeah.

465
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:42,915
(alarms wailing, engine rumbling)

466
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,217
- Does that look right?
- It looks great. You got it.

467
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:47,886
No, no, no, something's wrong,

468
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:49,421
- it's filling up with blood.
- (monitor beeping faster)

469
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,656
- What do you want to do? 
- I-I-I...

470
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:51,824
- What do you... 
- Just get the suction thing!

471
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,559
- What? What? Uh... 
- The suction thing.

(rapid beeping, alarms wailing)

473
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,332
- Gail, his BP's dropping.
- Come on! Come on.

474
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,700
It's dropping.

475
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,268
It's just... I can't see anything.

476

TODD: We gotta... I know, Gail.

477
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,439
Hey, buddy, I'm not gonna lie to you.

478
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,274
It's not looking good.

479
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,276
If we don't make it,

480
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:13,178
I'll see you in the next life, okay?

481
00:20:13,214 --> 00:20:15,547
- His BP, it's dropping, it's dropping. That's not good.
- What?

482
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,115
- Here. Should I grab some towels?
- Oh, God. What-what do I do?

483
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:18,317
I don't know.

484
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:21,486
It's breaking up! It's breaking up!

485
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:23,488
- I'm just gonna pack it.
- It's filling up with blood

486
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:25,190
- as fast as I can do it!
- I know. I know.

487
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:26,992
- Suction, suction!
- TODD: Yeah! Okay!
