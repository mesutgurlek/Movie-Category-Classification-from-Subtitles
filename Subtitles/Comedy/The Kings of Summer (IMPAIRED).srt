(knocking)

00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,900
Joe! Joe!

5
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:08,403
You've been in there
for 54... 55 minutes, Joe!

00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,456
(knocking)

(knocking)

8
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,542
Masturbation is fun.
I get it.

9
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,012
It's not very green to do it
with the shower running.

10
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,262
Jesus!

11
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,809
Bring your briefs
in there with you.

12
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,147
You're 15 years old.

13
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:39,358
It's not cute anymore.

14
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,813
Got his mother's fanny.

Your final was due
a week ago, Joe.

26
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:39,269
I mean, look...
look at the board.

27
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,511
School's over.

28
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,606
We're playing hangman here.

There you are.

32
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,737
- (laughs)
- Hey..

33
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,490
So, are you guys around tonight?

34
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:02,241
Because you should totally come
to Thirsty Thursdays.

35
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,413
- End-of-school tradition.
- Yeah. Yeah, totally.

36
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:06,379
- I'll... I'll be there.
- Cool.

37
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,206
So it's at Wolf's Pond,
whenever you...

38
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh... my God.

39
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,049
BOY:
Eat shit, Toy!

40
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,840
I can lend you a shirt.

41
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:17,512
I've got like five
in my locker.

42
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:19,508
(school bell ringing)

43
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,557
You know what, actually,
it doesn't look that bad.

44
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:23,053
(sighs)

45
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,890
So, pregame at Paul's
at like 7:00-ish.

46
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,892
Paul has his own apartment?

47
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,226
(horn honking)

48
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,774
What, you're not
going to acknowledge me?

49
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:32,938
- Hi.
- Mmm. Yeah.

50
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,274
Um, I will see you tonight.

51
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,901
Yes. Yeah, uh...

52
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,235
- Babe.
- Yes?

53
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,487
Let's go get egg bagels.

54
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,946
Okay. All right. Bye.

55
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,157
Paul. God.

56
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:44,580
(school bell rings)

57
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,123
I need a shirt.

58
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,671
(laughs) That's awesome.

59
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:54,460
That is... that is great.

60
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,089
Actually, I need a picture.
Shit, can I get my phone?

61
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,589
Hey. Mrs. Keenan?

62
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,007
Shh!

63
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,469
WOMAN: Patrick, why are you
running around?

64
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,846
Oh... Grandma,
you remember Joe.

65
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,057
Hi, Mrs. Keenan.

66
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,685
Darling, would you
like a cold washcloth?

67
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,060
What? No. No washcloth.

68
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,853
How about you, Joseph?

69
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,194
Actually, yeah, I would...
I'd love a washcloth.

70
00:05:15,195 --> 00:05:17,989
No, Mom, sit. What the hell?
What the hell is happening'?

71
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,617
My mom reminds me of Blanka.

72
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:24,240
That's the sound I hear
whenever she speaks.

73
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,492
Just the gibberish
of an undisciplined animal.

74
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,961
It's never going to end.
Even when I'm

75
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:30,579
an adult, she'll find me,
question me.

76
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,048
You're being a little
dramatic, I think.

77
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,172
Joe, they're giving me hives.

78
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:37,383
There's no way
that they can give you hives.

79
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,380
(controller clatters on floor)

80
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,465
Holy shit.

81
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,718
Hey, kiddo.

82
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,312
ANNOUNCER (from video game):
Round two. Fight!

83
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,984
(tapping continues)

84
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,779
- What, Dad?
- Should be a stud here.

85
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,658
(Joe's dad humming)

86
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,620
Oh, what's all this?

87
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,166
Carol's going to be here in 30.

88
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,004
- Go wash up.
- Uh, Dad, you know, urn,

89
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:17,001
I actually just realized
I have a party tonight,

90
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,798
so I'm not going to be
able to make it

91
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:20,172
for dinner and stuff.

92
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:21,505
Sorry.

93
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,007
Too bad.

94
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,383
The plans are already made.

95
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,885
Your sister's driving
all the way in.

96
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,138
I'm making lamb stew.

97
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,596
Are we in Beowulf?

98
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,598
Look, after dinner,

99
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,560
I was thinking
we might bring back Game Night.

100
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,812
It'll be fun.

101
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,607
Game... Game Night's
a family thing, Dad.

102
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,609
I'm not going to play Game Night
with some spider woman

103
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,360
you found in the gutter.

104
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,113
Carol is not a spider woman
that I found in the gutter, Joe.

105
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,163
She's a very nice lady
who happens to like me.

106
00:06:49,164 --> 00:06:50,911
And I like her.

107
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,877
So, we haven't played Game Night

108
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:56,544
since Mom died, and then,

109
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:59,465
all of a sudden, you meet
some floozy and expect...

110
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:01,378
Enough! Enough, Joe.

111
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,172
This is not a debate.

112
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,965
My house, my rules.

113
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,434
Now, go get ready.

114
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,520
WOMAN: So, Joe,
your dad told me

115
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:13,766
that you go to Tottenville.

116
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,726
Are you on any teams?

117
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,604
Carol, before we go any further,

118
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,022
you should know...

119
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,649
Frank is not my real father.

120
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,489
I love him,
and I owe him a lot.

121
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,453
You know,
he's very special to me,

122
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:27,655
but he's not my blood.

123
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,031
Is that true, Frank?

124
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,534
That's completely untrue.

125
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:32,201
I'm taking Ventnor.

126
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,954
Frank, the lamb was delicious.

127
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,915
Just so tender and...

128
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,960
it was like I was
chewing avocado meat.

129
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,510
I'm not sure I know
what you're saying, Colin.

130
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:45,381
Avocado meat.

131
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,800
(smacks lips, exhales)

132
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:52,012
Heather, do you remember
when Dad quit because, um,

133
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,931
you wouldn't trade him B&O?

134
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,853
- Remember that?
- Oh... oh, do I remember

135
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:58,727
when my own father called me
a "fear-mongering Chinaman?"

136
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,196
Yeah, I do... mostly
'cause I'm not a man.

137
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:02,064
Nor am I Chinese, so...

138
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,607
Oh, my God, what a panic.

139
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,905
That's something
my great-grandfather would say.

140
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:06,153
He's a racist.

141
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,616
DAD:
You do that often?

142
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:11,490
Eat the hamburger
and then the fries'?

143
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,868
You don't...
you don't mix it up?

144
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,577
I don't know, Dad.

145
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,204
Just asking.

146
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,706
MOM: We watched
a very good movie

147
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,999
on the cable last night.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,591
- Mmm.
- Oh, honey, what was it called?

149
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:22,925
DAD: it had that guy
in it, that actor...

150
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:23,966
- What was it'?
- What's his name?

151
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,426
Called, uh, Heimlich, the...

152
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:27,136
Yes, yes! With, uh,
what's-his-name.

153
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:29,385
The Prince,
the... the New Prince.

154
00:08:29,386 --> 00:08:31,427
Will Smith?

155
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,178
Will! Yes. Will Prince.

156
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,770
- Will Prince.
- Oh, my gosh, what does he play?

157
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:36,357
- Superhero? 
- Oh, he plays a superhero in this one.

158
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:38,439
Kind of a supe...
Not a cape, though.

159
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,484
- Yeah, it's called Heimlich.
- The darnedest thing.

160
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,818
Come on.

161
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,286
You want to be my buddy?

162
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,321
Yes. I would love that.

163
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,948
Tennessee for Park Place.

164
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:53,996
Right now, straight up.

165

What? No.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

- COLIN: Yes. Quiet.

169
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,678
Quiet, everybody,
except for the men.

170
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,922

- JOE: This is bullshit, Dad.

This is collusion.

Dad, come on.

175
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,391
Yeah, it's
kind of cruel, Frank.

176
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:19,016
FRANK:
No, no.

177
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,018
He's just mad because he
doesn't want to be here,

178
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,236
so he's being a little shit.

179
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,826
- Oh, great.
- Oh, no.

180
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,402
Joe, don't go.

181

He's quitting.
That's nice work, Dad.

182

He'll be all right.

183

185

Patrick, have you been
washing that foot every day?

186
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,588
Because moisture can get trapped
in there from the brace.

187

Jim Henson, you know.

Yeah, I'd like

Goddamn it!

201

Yeah, his name is Frank Toy.

Brown hair, uh, height unknown.

WOMAN:
The problem with Joseph's habit

208
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:41,354
is that one day there will be
an actual emergency

209
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:43,693
or violent crime
coming from this house.

210
00:10:43,694 --> 00:10:46,728
Yeah, well,
the night is still young.

211
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,450
Uh, Mr. Toy, are you familiar
with "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"?

212
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:54,444
Yes. I experienced a childhood
on the planet Earth, so...

213
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,366
yes, I've heard of that one.

214
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,958
Do you think you can
apply it to my situation

215
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,784
in an allegorical fashion?

216
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,828
Okay. It's a...

217
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,250
- a story that involves
a boy who... -Ah, ah, ah...

218
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:07,374
- constantly cries "wolf."
- WOMAN: Stop.

219
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,423
And when the wolf finally
comes... He doesn't know it.

220
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:11,420
- I'm sorry, "The Boy
Who Cried" what? -Wolf.

221
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,964
- Fuck you.
- WOMAN: Let's go.

222
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,093
- "The Boy Who Cried" what?
- Stop talking.

223
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:17,718
- Wolf.
- Get the fuck off my porch

224
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,683
before I knock your dick
in the dirt.

225
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:22,639
- Come on, let's go. 
- I don't see what the problem was.

226
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,642
- Why are you yelling at me?
- What's next? Three Little Pigs?

227
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,395
It gets easier.
Okay? Honest. I swear.

228
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,147
Look at it this way:
In two years,

229
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,946
he's going to pay
for you to leave.

230
00:11:31,947 --> 00:11:34,735
(chuckles) Yeah.

231

this may sound desperate,

Don't smile, 'cause I'm...

234
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:43,118
- Don't.
- No, this is very serious.

235
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,292
- I am serious.
- I'm taking you so seriously.

236
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:47,456
I can be packed in 15 minutes.

00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,618
That's the price
of space travel, right?

326
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,203
Uh... yeah, sure.

327
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,998
Um, so get ready for this.

328
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,093
Paul skedaddled on me
last night.

329
00:16:42,094 --> 00:16:45,045
Uh, wow, that's...
that's a dick move.

330
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,713
(stammers)

331
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,465
Tools... out of the driveway now.

332
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,180
- I'm on the phone.
- Oh.

333
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:51,721
I don't give a shit.
Right now.

334
00:16:51,722 --> 00:16:53,016
Is everything okay there?

335
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:55,096
- No!
- Who is this? Patrick?

336
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,016
- Kelly.
- Kelly. A girl.

337
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,769
- Jesus, that's
a pleasant surprise. -Dad...

338
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,986
Listen, Kelly, Joe can't talk
right now because he's grounded.

339
00:17:03,987 --> 00:17:05,982
He will call you back sometime

340
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,443
before his hot new bedtime
of 7:30.

341
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,986
You have a good night.

342
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,404
Okay.

343
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,281
Tools. Now.

344
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,328
And if they're ruined,
you're going to work

345
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:17,044
the whole set off
this summer. I mean it.

346
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:18,662
A paper route.

347
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,163
Big Chief Indian Corn.

348
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,258
Goddamn Ohio Soccer Jazz.
I don't care.

349
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:24,376
You have your pick.

350
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,175
This bullshit ends today.

351
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,051
Yes, it does.

352
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,853
PATRICK: I can't walk
all day like this, Joe.

353
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:39,316
JOE: Okay.
We're almost there.

354
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:40,850
Just 50 yards.

355
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,143
PATRICK:
Almost where?

356
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,395
What the hell
could you be showing me

357
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,693
in the woods right now'?

358
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,402
What is this, Joe?

359
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,326
You want your room
facing sunrise or sunset?

360
00:17:52,327 --> 00:17:53,613
My What?!

361
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,742
This is the site
of our new house, man.

362
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,409
What, like a tree house?

363
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,787
No, like a real house.

364
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:01,037
I'm moving out.
We're moving out.

365
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,460
What the hell are
you talking about?

366
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:03,670
My mom won't let me walk

367
00:18:03,671 --> 00:18:05,250
around the house
without socks on.

368
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,628
She's definitely
not going to let us

369
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:08,003
live out here in the woods.

370
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,132
No one will
find us out here, Patrick.

371
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,221
This house,
this land, it's ours!

372
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:13,763
We make the rules, you know?

373
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:15,635
Like men!

374
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,637
So we're just going
to move out here

375
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,978
and, uh, build a house
from scratch?

376
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:21,019
How hard can it be?

377
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,564
Hold on... what is this kid

378
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:24,311
doing here?

379
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,854
I don't know.

380
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,569
I'm afraid to tell him to leave.

381
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,863
I don't know
what he's capable of.

382
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:31,526
Forget him.

383
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,153
Break ground with me, man.

384
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,998
Look, I'm sorry, Joe,
but I can't do this.

385
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,042
Call me when you get home.

Patrick?

387
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,172
MRS. KEENAN: So you wore
the blue shirt today?

388
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,800
Not the one with the pocket?

389
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,302
- He's got the blue one on.
- PATRICK: Yeah.

390
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,429
Whoa, rope in
the attitude, mister.

391
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,773
This is your mother
you're speaking to.

392
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:02,729
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Huh? Huh?

393
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,185
- My word. - Sorry, Dad.
- Who is he doing a show for?

394
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,563
Oh, my gosh, I know,
it's like he's on camera.

00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:07,982
Are there girls around?

396
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:09,653
MRS. KEENAN:
Yeah, there must be. Uh-oh.

397
00:19:09,654 --> 00:19:11,149
Girl check.

398
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,651
Checking for a girl in a bikini.

399
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:16,404
- Nope. I don't see one.

I'll do it.

"I'll do it unless God gives me

$80 to $100 in food

632
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:31,240
grill utensils
and about $240 in cash.

633
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,460
Now, I presume
we're not pressing charges.

00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,665
Frank, would you like

635

644

Well, he used to love it,
you know,

the four of us.

Well, what am I
supposed to do, Heather?

648
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,447
You know, if I died, he'd get

649
00:33:06,448 --> 00:33:08,486
over it in about six weeks.

650
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,197
Uh, sir, Chinese food is here,

651

00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,661
$51?

655
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,502
What the hell did you order?
Heather?

656
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:21,125
Don't look at me.
I got dumplings.

657
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,213
I'm not even hungry.

658
00:33:22,214 --> 00:33:23,880
Yeah, I actually ordered a...

659
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:26,424
a large portion of the shrimp
with lobster sauce.

660
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:28,047
I figured it was pretty neutral.

661
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,512
We can eat it family-style.

662
00:33:29,513 --> 00:33:30,847
- Neutral?
- Mm-hmm.

663
00:33:30,848 --> 00:33:32,059
Shrimp with lobster sauce?

664
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,177
Yeah.

665
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,887
I can't think

666
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:37,607
of a more marginal dish
in any culture.

667
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,394
- MAN (quietly): Hi.
- Hey.

668
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:43,270
What's your name?

669
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,897
My American name is Gary.

670
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,821
You ever have one
of those days, Gary?

671
00:33:46,822 --> 00:33:48,150
What kind of days?

672
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,818
The kind I'm having right now.

673
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,570
I don't know what kind
of day you're having.

674
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,947
Where you feel like somebody

675
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,537
is pissing in your face
all day long.

676
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:55,659
Is that good or bad?

677
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,494
- Bad.
- Bad.

678
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,996
Gary,

679
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,164
every time...

680
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,585
You see those wontons, Gary?

681
00:34:03,586 --> 00:34:05,172
- You see the size of them?
- Mm-hmm.

682
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:07,378
Those wontons are too big,
my friend.

683
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,380
Everybody loves those.
People ask us for the recipe.

684
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,090
We won't provide it.

685
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,967
It's part of our training...
how to deal with people

686
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,468
who want the recipe too bad.

687
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,095
- Oh? 
-We have a phrase we have to repeat.

688
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,097
- What is that?
- "We won't provide it."

689
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,682
I can see the value
of these now.

690
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,684
I can have the kids
from the neighborhood come over

691
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:24,395
and bounce up and down on them
at a fucking party.

692
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,444
- Oh, sarcasm, I get it.
- It's like a bouncy house.

693
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:27,856
The poor man's wit.

694
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,778
My question for you, Gary, is:

695
00:34:29,779 --> 00:34:33,493
How do you want me to eat these
with my normal human mouth?

696
00:34:33,494 --> 00:34:36,410
Do you want me to unhinge my jaw
like an anaconda?

697
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:39,201
Should I put this in my belly
and lay out in the sun

698
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,296
- for two months, digesting it?
- Dad, enough! My God!

699
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:43,753
- Just pay the poor guy.
- GARY: My God. Yeah, and maybe

700
00:34:43,754 --> 00:34:45,419
you should get
some forks in the house

701
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,127
so your dad doesn't have
to unhinge his stupid jaw to...

702
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,753
We're done here, and for
the record, your wontons

703
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,470
are way too big.
Nobody can fucking eat those.

704
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:53,137
No, I can eat them;
just give them to me.

705
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:55,852
- Good night, Gary.
- I'd be very happy to eat those.

706
00:34:55,853 --> 00:34:58,137
Your house has a bad vibe.

707
00:34:58,138 --> 00:34:59,560
JOE (voice-over):
No more rice,

708
00:34:59,561 --> 00:35:00,931
no more pasta.

709
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,275
It's time to eat an honest meal.

710
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:03,809
Biaggio?

711
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,983
You and I will take
to the trees.

712
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:07,271
Patrick,

713
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,023
you, uh...

714
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,399
Yeah, yeah, I know.

715
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,777
I... I pick berries and apples

716
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,193
and forage.

717
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,787
And it makes a lot
of sense, yeah.

718
00:35:14,788 --> 00:35:16,363
(grunting)

719
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,157
Oh, what?

720
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:21,037
You should be the hunter
just because you're stronger?

721
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:22,162
Yeah.

722
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,544
Oh, don't...

723
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,922
don't drink the water.

724
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:33,636
Uh-uh,
I shouldn't have done that.

725
00:35:33,637 --> 00:35:34,929
I'm glad you came out, Biaggio.

726
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,383
I mean, this is...

727
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,102
this is our rite
of passage, goddamn it.

728
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:39,386
Have you ever felt

729
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,972
this at one with...
with yourself?

730
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,724
With your instincts,
with nature?

731
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,726
This...

732
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,186
this masculine?

733
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,647
I don't know.

734
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:53,567
I don't really see myself
as having a gender.

735
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,196
Is that a problem?

736
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,198
It's not great.

737
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,373
This way to the bison,
my friend.

738
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,830
When you get up here,

739
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,207
you can see a field of bison

740
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,793
majestically grazing.

741
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,512
Ooh, get your weapon ready.

742
00:36:12,513 --> 00:36:14,506
- Yeah.
- (horn honking)

743
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,518
Let's go, Biaggio.
Come on.

744
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,722
No, but the...

745
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,808
the quarter dark is so good.

746
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,935
Boston Market, that's...

747
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:31,230
that's from our old life,

748
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,359
our weak life.

749
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,532
Wait here.

750
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,327
(horn honks)

751
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:51,166
What will it attract...
scavengers?

752
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,881
Scavengers?
Look at this.

753
00:36:52,882 --> 00:36:54,216
Fit for a goddamn king.

754
00:36:54,217 --> 00:36:56,431
Are there any bears
in these woods?

755
00:36:56,432 --> 00:36:59,174
Hope so.

756
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,974
A bear would feed us
for a month.

757
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,393
Perhaps we can disillusion him.

758
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,862
A bear who doesn't believe
in anything

759
00:37:10,863 --> 00:37:13,021
will be easier to bring down.

760
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,773
(clears throat)

761
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:18,777
I... I guess I agree with that.

762
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,201
Might be a little small.

763
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,665
One, two, three, four, five.

764
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,418
(thud)

765
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,631
(insect chirping)

766
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,230
(slacking)

767
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,859
You have a tag on your pants.

768
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,905
Did you buy new clothes
for this?

769
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,000
It comes like that...
it's the style.

770
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:07,585
(clattering, animal screeching)

771
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,245
Yes!

772
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,789
Okay, come on.

773
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,792
No, the swords.

774
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,337
We got it.

775
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,339
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

776
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,924
Oh, God, okay.

777
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:23,347
Flip, flip, flip the thing,

778
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:26,094
and I'll, uh...
I'll take its life.

779
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,642
Strike it at its neck.
Don't compromise the meat.

780
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:29,640
- I know, I know.
- It may plead; don't listen.

781
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,184
- Be cold, clinical with the blade. 
-I will.

782
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:33,277
It may try to bargain...
this is natural.

783
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:34,269
- Just turn it!
- Okay!

784
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,562
(screeching)

785
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,940
(both screaming)

786
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,489
PATRICK:
Yeah, I'm just surprised

787
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,709
you found a live chicken
in these woods.

788
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,920
Yup, yes, sir.

789
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,372
That's amazing.

790
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,373
JOE:
Biaggio,

791
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:58,085
your corn pudding is to die for.

792
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,633
I have to know the recipe.

793
00:38:59,634 --> 00:39:01,302
Mmm.

794
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,887
Oh, God.

795
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,639
So smug.

796
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,849
PATRICK:
Dude,

797
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,350
food attracts mice.

798
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,603
And you know what mice attract?

799
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:16,441
- Stupid fucking questions?
- No.

800
00:39:16,442 --> 00:39:17,526
They attract snakes.

801
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:19,240
In Italian, the word for "snake"

802
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:21,149
means "the demon's cock."

803
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,365
- No, it doesn't. 
- There's a chance that it doesn't.

804
00:39:23,366 --> 00:39:24,361
Whatever, dude.

805
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,154
From here on out,

806
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,202
- all the food goes either in the
fire or in the ground. - (groans)

807
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:31,415
God, man, you're
so doom and gloom

808
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,457
all the time.
Just enjoy this.

809
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,000
It's not doom and gloom, bro.

810
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:37,964
I just found a copperhead
skin two hours ago.

811
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:40,299
I read once that animals
see fear as a color.

812
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,922
I thought you can't read.

813
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:43,922
No, I can read.

814
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,258
I can't cry.

815
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,263
Well, there you go.

816
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,605
OFFICER: Okay, we traced
Joe and Patrick's cell phones

817
00:39:54,606 --> 00:39:55,601
to this bus.

818
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,352
Savanovic, Dietzel,

819
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,771
check under the seats,
see if the bathroom's locked.

820
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,898
This is an artist's projection

821
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,274
of what he might look like now.

822
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,447
The beard may be a little full.

823
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:05,193
FRANK:
They aren't here.

824
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,616
This is a waste
of real time, Davis.

825
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:09,448
You can check under
the bus if you want.

826
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,038
There's not a lot of air

827
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,035
that can make it
under there, but...

828
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,329
Listen to me. Our son ran away
about eight years ago.

829
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,298
- I'm sorry. Did he come back?
- So, he came back?

830
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:21,627
- Well, it was a really hard time
for us. -Uh, thank you.

831
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,594
Jesus, we don't need this
right now, sir. Are you okay?

832
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:25,179
- Uh, what does he mean?
- He doesn't mean anything.

833
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,766
- You need to lean on each other.
- Sir.

834
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:28,884
- Oh, my God.
- Get him back on the bus.

835
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,683
- Davis. 
- No, I don't want to get on the bus.

836
00:40:30,684 --> 00:40:32,271
I'm a licensed therapist!

837
00:40:32,272 --> 00:40:33,847
This is Joe's bag.

838
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,317
It's empty.

839
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,937
- That's Patrick's phone.
- That's Joe's.

840
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,939
Some dude had a beeper?

841
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,157
DRIVER:
That's dope.

842
00:40:43,158 --> 00:40:45,359
MRS. KEENAN:
W-Wait a minute.

843
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,655
What... what is that?

844
00:40:46,656 --> 00:40:47,905
What does that mean?

845
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:49,821
It's a Monopoly piece.

846
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,074
MY Piece.

847
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:55,285
He's taunting me.

848
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,957
He's like the Zodiac Killer.

849
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:59,376
Okay, the worst thing you can do
is hope right now.

850
00:40:59,377 --> 00:41:00,796
I'm just letting you know.

851
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,006
(rhythmic clanking)

852
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,264
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

853
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,809
We have to do this for real.
Ready?

854
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,853
One, two...
a-one, two, three, four!

855
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,733
(rhythmic clanking resumes)

856
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,369
(Biaggio chanting)

857
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,428
(rhythmic clanking continues)

858
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:57,265
(chanting)

859
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,146
(rhythmic grunting)

860
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,742
(birds chirping and cawing)

861
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,461
JOE (voice-over):
Cheers.

862
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,834
(chuckles)

863
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,462
We have water, shelter.
We can put a balanced meal

864
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,548
on the table.
I mean, we answer to no one.

865
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,092
We're men.

866
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,094
Just now'?

867
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,554
Just happened?

868
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,389
Just happened, man.

869
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,391
You don't say.

870
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,769
JOE: All I'm saying
is that if anything

871
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,898
was missing from all of this...

872
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,733
...it'd be a woman's touch.

873
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,902
We have Biaggio. (laughs)

874
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,577
JOE:
Doesn't count.

875
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,253
- Right here. Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, what, what?

876
00:43:00,254 --> 00:43:01,536
Hey-

877
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,505
- KELLY: Hello.
- Got to get my drink on.

878
00:43:03,506 --> 00:43:05,582
Hi. Do you guys want anything?

879
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,130
Uh, I got a Titleist right here.

880
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:09,920
It's worth like $3.50,
so if I could get

881
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,514
a Sun Chips and a beer
and then 50 cents

882
00:43:11,515 --> 00:43:12,970
in change,
that would be fantastic.

883
00:43:12,971 --> 00:43:15,809
Okay, well, we do not
run on a barter system.

884
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,557
What the fuck
is a "barger" system?

885
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:21,181
- KELLY: Barter.
- Barger?

886
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,148
When you use equal goods
or services instead of cash.

887
00:43:23,149 --> 00:43:24,687
So you admit that these
are equal goods

888
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:25,936
- in your barger system.
- Yeah, but we

889
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,189
do not run on a barter system.

890
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,440
That's not the point.

891
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,868
(birds chirping)

892
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,461
KELLY: You're on the news, Joe.
Your dad was on K-19.

893
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:51,086
(sighs) Okay, please.

894
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:54,172
My dad is loving
every second of this, okay?

895
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,466
No, Joe, I seriously doubt that.

896
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,889
So, uh...

897
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,227
...does Patrick have a really
big, crazy beard now, too'?

898
00:44:02,228 --> 00:44:04,521
Yeah, yeah, his is a little
more serious than mine.

899
00:44:04,522 --> 00:44:06,560
I have... I have thin hair.

900
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,983
You know, you have to groom it.

901
00:44:07,984 --> 00:44:09,271
Oh, right.

902
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,940
Yeah, like Paul's
sick-ass goatee?

903
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:13,984
Uh...

904
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,778
I guess you wouldn't
have heard...

905
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,197
Paul and I broke up.

906
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,866
Oh.

907
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,585
This isn't over, Kelly.

908
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,912
This isn't over, Kelly!

909
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,165
(beeping)

910
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,596
(laughs) Uh... uh, no,
I did not catch wind of that.

911
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,507
Um...

912
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,976
I'm sorry, though.

913
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:45,765
I, uh, came here actually
to invite you to dinner.

914
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,810
Uh, sort of like a...
a housewarming thing.

915
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,437
- If you want.
- Yeah, obviously I want to,

916
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:52,189
but how do I...
how do I get there?

917
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,440
Do I have to...

918
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,068
be blindfolded or something?

919
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:56,943
In all seriousness, it's of

920
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:00,073
absolute vital importance
that you not tell anyone,

921
00:45:00,074 --> 00:45:02,118
- not bring anyone. No one.
- Yes.

922
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:04,335
- This is life or death, Kelly.
- Okay, okay, okay.

923
00:45:04,336 --> 00:45:06,125
Okay.

924
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,293
(whooping)

925
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:14,466
(groans)

926
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,890
Bitch.

927
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,893
Joe.

928
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,732
(rustling in bushes)

929
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:42,332
(rustling continues,
footsteps scurrying)

930
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,252
Dude.

931
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,962
Biaggio.

932
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,057
You're camouflaged horribly.

933
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,677
Dude!

934
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:04,970
Where's Joe?

935
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:06,304
What's up, man?

936
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,472
What's up?

937
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,890
Have you seen Joe?

938
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,142
No, I don't know where he is.

939
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,560
But where's Biaggio?

940
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,396
You're right here.

941
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,321
You're right... Oh, God.

942
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,822

943

Okay, fine, fine.

949
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,016
We bought a few chickens.

950
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:29,639
Less than 30, more than 25.

951
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,059
But the fact is Biaggio and I

952
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,853
have been hunting and getting

953
00:47:32,854 --> 00:47:34,601
pretty goddamn dangerous
out there.

954
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,227
This is hypocrisy.

955
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,777
Joe, listen to yourself.
How can you sleep at night?

956
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,566
Look, I can deal with the fact

957
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,739
that the chickens
were store-bought.

958
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,985
Okay? I can.

959
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,653
But it really bothers me

960
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,781
that the loaded potato
isn't Biaggio's recipe.

961
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,828
No. No, no, that
actually really is.

962
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:53,546
I... I honestly have no idea
where he's getting chives.

963
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:59,298
So, um, can I pass or...?

964
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,259
MR. KEENAN (voice-over):
Judy keeps saying

965
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,599
that wherever they are,
at least they have each other.

966
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,300
(sighs)

967
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,895
I guess that calms me down
sometimes, you know?

968
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,899
FRANK (voice-over): I got to
wonder whose idea it all was.

969
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,143
MR. KEENAN (laughing):
Yeah.

970
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,561
Wait, are you serious?

971
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,905
It could have been
Patrick's idea.

972
00:48:19,906 --> 00:48:21,236
No way. Oh, my gosh.

973
00:48:21,237 --> 00:48:22,903
Joe is the one who drove them

974
00:48:22,904 --> 00:48:24,401
to the movies
when they were nine.

975
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,904
Remember?
Only reason they got caught

976
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:27,951
is 'cause they went
through a drive-through.

977
00:48:27,952 --> 00:48:30,782
Sunfish. Damn it.

978
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:34,538
Joe is the one who tied
Patrick's pet turtle to a kite.

979
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:36,413
Wanted to send him up
into space.

980
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:37,747
(Frank laughing)

981
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,962
I forgot about that.

982
00:48:38,963 --> 00:48:40,050
Are you laughing?

983
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,751
Are you laughing at that?

984
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,846
FRANK: It was... it was more
of a laugh of admiration.

985
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:45,922
For the murder of a turtle'?

986
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,258
The turtle died, then?

987
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,260
Yeah, the turtle died, Frank.

988
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,595
I suppose that's a shame.

989
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,473
The problem is
Joe's a mama's boy.

990
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:56,942
Clarissa was good for him.

991
00:48:56,943 --> 00:48:58,436
She just let him be.

992
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,813
Something about his innate
sense of menace

993
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,407
seemed to charm her.

994
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,735
Now it's just the two of us.

995
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,488
I... I'm afraid I broke him.

996
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,116
MR. KEENAN:
I mean, our sons did run away.

997
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,870
They don't... they don't want
to be with us.

998
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:19,747
They don't want
to live in our houses.

999
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:24,335
I guess maybe... we did do
something wrong, you know?

1000
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,680
What the heck?

1001
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,050
Ah. (snaps fingers)

1002
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,975
Patrick is the one
who set up Bicycle Olympics

1003
00:49:33,976 --> 00:49:36,055
in my goddamn swimming pool.

1004
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:40,018
That was a nice
$1,300 repair job.

1005
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:43,104
I never called you about that.

1006
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,774
Thought we were having
a moment just then, Frank.

1007
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,369
And Bicycle Olympics
was Joe's idea.

1008
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,952
Goddamn it.

1009
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,418
(sighs)

1010
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,622
(crickets chirping)

1011
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:09,088
Joe, I love it here.

1012
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,634
I want to spend the rest
of my days with you.

1013
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:15,220
That's an emotional fact for me.

1014
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,770
Yes, but...

1015
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,477
But I worry.

1016
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:25,313
I can't keep my brain
from worrying.

1017
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,815
My..

1018
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,776
my woman brain.

1019
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,779
Ah, my sweet Kelly,

1020
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,624
why should we let it
ruin this moment'?

1021
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,829
FRANK (voice booming):
Joe!

1022
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,456
It's time to come home.

1023
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,834
(grunts)

1024
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,799
Leave us, Frank.

1025
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,759
The forest is ours.

1026
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,719
You're out of your depth.

1027
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,269
You made a fool of me
in front of the whole town, boy.

1028
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,474
A harlequin.

1029
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:04,570
He is a man grown, and his path
is his own to choose.

1030
00:51:04,571 --> 00:51:06,064
Silence, land-trunt.

1031
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,489
(grunts fiercely)

1032
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:18,199
(video game sound effects)

1033
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,993
(yells)

1034
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,746
VIDEO GAME ANNOUNCER:
You win.

1035
00:51:21,747 --> 00:51:23,371
- Perfect.
- (groans)

1036
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,582
Joe. Hey, bro,
we got company.

1037
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,959
Lots of company.

1038
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,758
Hi, brother.

1039
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,343
BIAGGIO:
All right.

1040
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,471
KELLY:
This is so great, Joe.

1041
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:44,350
(laughter)

1042
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:45,602
BOY: Yo, bros,
what did you guys do

1043
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,936
with this chicken?

1044
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,526
Melts in your
goddamn mouth, right?

1045
00:51:48,527 --> 00:51:51,694
So, um, do you guys eat
the same thing every night?

1046
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,156
Yeah, a lot of chicken.

1047
00:51:53,157 --> 00:51:54,152
They're everywhere here.

1048
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,496
- Right, Joe?
- Oh.

1049
00:51:55,497 --> 00:51:56,904
All sorts of them.

1050
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,364
Yeah, Patrick, um,

1051
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,866
he usually takes care
of the gathering,

1052
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,244
you know, berries, roots.

1053
00:52:01,245 --> 00:52:03,244
I take care of the meat
and the protein.

1054
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,838
(grunts) And the shopping.

1055
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:07,415
He's a great bargain hunter.

1056
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:09,709
I do the hunting.

1057
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,681
So, Biaggio, what do you do?

1058
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:16,302
I met a dog the other day

1059
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:17,597
that taught me how to die.

1060
00:52:17,598 --> 00:52:19,510
(Joe clears throat)

1061
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,726
Yeah, uh, Biaggio here,
he's a...

1062
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:23,017
he's a real renaissance man.

1063
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:24,604
BIAGGIO:
I have incredible focus.

1064
00:52:24,605 --> 00:52:26,728
You should see his hands.
So quick.

1065
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:28,853
This cat right here,
he can snatch trout

1066
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,026
right out
of the goddamn stream.

1067
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:31,022
Just... (smacks lips)

1068
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,231
Bullshit.

1069
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,905
No, it's true. I've seen it.

1070
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,915
I rest my case.

1071
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:44,494
Did you take anything out?

1072
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,623
PATRICK: No, he doesn't
want your money.

1073
00:52:46,624 --> 00:52:47,961
He just does it for sport.

1074
00:52:47,962 --> 00:52:49,207
JOE:
You know, urn,

1075
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:52,293
I picked those flowers myself.

1076
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,342
Oh, yeah.
They're really pretty.

1077
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,302
♪

1078
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,349
KELLY: So what is
this all supposed to be?

1079
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,101
This is the den.

1080
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:09,560
Oh, this is the den.

1081
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:10,778
How stupid of me.

1082
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,693
Um, and that...

1083
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,112
that is the master bedroom.

1084
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:22,699
Wow.

1085
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,701
This is really amazing, Joe.

1086
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,828
I mean, I had no idea

1087
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:28,996
how talented you were.

1088
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,586
I mean, of course,
I suspected, but...

1089
00:53:30,587 --> 00:53:32,380
- Of course. Right.
- Of course.

1090
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,967
(grunts)

1091
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:45,722
(grunts)

1092
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:48,933
(fireworks booming, whistling)

1093
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:52,061
(girls screaming)

1094
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,731
(laughter)

1095
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,154
PATRICK (laughing):
That's horrible.

1096
00:53:56,155 --> 00:53:57,859
(laughing)

1097
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,783
- PATRICK: Yeah. Uh...
- (laughs)

1098
00:53:59,784 --> 00:54:02,739
(insects chittering)

1099
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,710
Vicki's making eyes
at you, man.

1100
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,870
Go talk to her.
Look at her.

1101
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,455
She's so into it.

1102
00:54:10,456 --> 00:54:11,706
There's no point

1103
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,875
in me talking to her anyways.

1104
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,127
Why not?

1105
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:18,130
Joe...

1106
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,800
I'm gay.

1107
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,933
Are you sure? Um...

1108
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,889
Yes.

1109
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,894
My lungs fill up with fluid
every time the seasons change.

1110
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,856
That's not being gay, Biaggio.

1111
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,649
What?

1112
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,698
I'm pretty sure
that's cystic fibrosis.

1113
00:54:40,699 --> 00:54:42,153
Oh.

1114
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:43,988
Biaggio, I don't know why

1115
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,824
you're smiling... cystic fibrosis
is not a walk in the park.

1116
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,418
It's actually
a very serious medical...

1117
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:51,537
Hey, what-what about Kelly?

1118
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,707
She's just doing what...
all girls do.

1119
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,042
You know?

1120
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:58,214
Pretending like
she doesn't care.

1121
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:00,465
Playing hard to get.
I don't know.

1122
00:55:00,466 --> 00:55:03,007
(laughter)

1123
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,931
Oh, man.

1124
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,273
(breath exhales sharply)

1125
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,528

(floor creaking)

1128
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,430
(whispers):
Hey.

1129
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:52,849
Patrick?

1130
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,944
- PATRICK: Yeah?
- Can you sleep?

1131
00:55:54,945 --> 00:55:56,561
PATRICK:
Um... yeah.

1132
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:59,657
Well, do you want to go
for a walk or something?

1133
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:02,149
'Cause I can't sleep.

1134
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,369
- PATRICK: Sure.
- Okay.

1135
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,791
(insects continue
chirping softly)

(floor creaking quietly)

1140
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,788
(whispers):
Hey, Joe?

1141
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:56,755

in the gutter, yes.

1629

01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:28,701
It wouldn't have worked anyway.

1631
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:30,286
She didn't...

1632
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:32,747
(sighs)

1633
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:34,000
(voice-over):
I don't know, she...

1634
01:27:34,001 --> 01:27:36,333
she didn't make me nervous.

1635
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:39,503
Not like your mom did, anyway.

1636
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,881
And you need that.

1637
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:43,509
(elevator bell dings)

1638
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,268
FRANK:
Mm-hmm.

01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,433
(Mrs. Keenan sighs)

1640
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:54,983
MR. KEENAN (quietly):
I know. I know.

1641
01:27:54,984 --> 01:27:57,322
(metallic clanking and creaking)

1642
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,743
(loud, labored breathing)

1643
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,966
(brakes squeak)

1644
01:28:53,203 --> 01:28:54,750
What's going on over there?

1645
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:57,289
(chuckles, sighs)

1646
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:00,918
Patrick's just being an idiot.
