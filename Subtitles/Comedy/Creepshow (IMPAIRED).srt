1
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:20,978
MAN: I told you before
I didn't want you to read this crap.

2
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,272
I never saw such rotten crap in my life.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,109
Where do you get this shit?
Who sells it to you?

4
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,612
I'm talking to you, young man.
You wanna answer when I'm talking to you.

5
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,657
Remember who puts the frigging bread
on the table around here?

6
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,285
WOMAN: Don't be too hard on him,
all the kids read them.

7
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,245
MAN:
My boy isn't all the kids.

8
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,289
You wanna know
where this is going, Billy?

9
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,666
In the garbage.
Right into the frigging garbage.

10
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,960
Now, you got any smart mouth
about that?

11
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:49,006
BOY: I don't see how it's any worse
than the books in your dresser.

12
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,592
Those ones under your underwear,
those sex books.

13
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,303
- Stan, you didn't have to--
- Hit him?

14
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,348
Not only do I find out he's reading this crap,
he's a goddamn little snoop as well.

15
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,808
No, it wasn't like that!

16
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:04,229
You said for me to get your cuff links.
It was on Sunday.

17
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,899
The windows are open downstairs,
I better close them.

18
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,568
No, I'll do it.
I got some garbage I wanna throw away.

19
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,738
Daddy, please don't throw it away.
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,909
The next time, young man, I find you with
a worthless piece of shit like this again...

21
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,495
...you won't sit down for a week,
buddy boy.

22
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,497
Remember that.

23
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,290
Tuck in.

24
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,143
That takes care of that.

25
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,938
WOMAN:
Stan, don't you think you were...

26
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,190
...a little hard on him?

27
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,151
Did you see that crap?
All that horror crap?

28
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,403
Things coming out of crates
and eating people?

29
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:57,199
Dead people coming back to life?
People turning into weeds, for chrissake?

30
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,452
- Well, yes, I did, but I--
- Well, you want him reading that stuff?

31
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,329
- Well, no, but--
- All right, then.

32
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,915
I took care of it.

33
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,668
That's why God made fathers, babe.

34
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,629
That's why God made fathers.

35
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,219
I hope you rot in hell.

36
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,319
Do you really think she'll be out,
Aunt Sylvia?

37
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,697
Of course she will, Richard.
You know that.

38
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,200
You can set your watch by her.
Six o'clock on the dot.

39
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:49,538
Pass those scones, Cass.
You're such a hog.

40
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,376
You married a great hog, Henry.

41
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,212
But then I suppose you know that,
don't you?

42
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,217
Our Cass has always had
such extremely healthy appetites.

43
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,720
Who's coming out, Cass?

44
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,765
You mean Cass hasn't told you about
dotty old Great-Aunt Bedelia...

45
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,018
...the patriarch of our clan?

46
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,895
Isn't she the one
that was supposed to have...?

47
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,941
- Well....
- Supposed to have murdered her father?

48
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,151
Yes.

49
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,907
SYLVIA:
Bedelia is my aunt...

50
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,952
...which means that she's
Richard and Cass' great-aunt...

51
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,247
...which also means
that she's older than God.

52
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,251
But her father, Nathan Grantham,
was even older and meaner than that.

53
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,589
All a bunch of dirty vultures...

54
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:47,054
...just waiting to get your hands
on my money.

55
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,390
He was hysterically jealous of Bedelia
all his life.

56
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,392
Complete Freudian relationship.

57
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,022
Then when he was about 184,
he had a stroke...

58
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,442
...and lucky Bedelia,
she got to nurse him full time.

59
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,861
Then she met a fella.

60
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,073
Yes, sir, a real September courtship.

61
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,449
September courtship?

62
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,619
This was October or November
at the very least.

63
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,580
He was 75. Aunt Bedelia is...?

64
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,248
Never mind, my dears.

65
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:19,169
The point is, Henry,
Bedelia loved her rather elderly beau...

66
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,421
...and her own father had him murdered.

67
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,968
RICHARD: Yarbro was the guy's name,
and he supposedly died...

68
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,889
...in a "hunting accident."

69
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,308
That's what's on the books, anyway.

70
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,811
For Bedelia, it was the last straw.

71
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,065
She bashed her father's head in
with a marble ashtray.

72
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,151
So rumor has it.

73
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,405
SYLVIA:
Well, however it happened...

74
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,158
...it was good riddance
to some extremely bad rubbish.

75
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,994
And my lovely niece
and my handsome nephew...

76
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,498
...have very good reasons for being pleased
at old Nathan's death.

77
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:01,253
There was no trouble about the will.
Share and share alike.

78
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:10,137
And now every Father's Day,
every single Father's Day since his death...

79
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,557
...for seven long years,
she returns to this house...

80
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,350
...the scene of her crime.

81
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,520
- Is that--?
SYLVIA: Oh, yes.

82
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,857
You can almost set your watch by her.

83
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,530
Screech to a halt, as they say.

84
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,575
- Do you think she really did it?
- Oh, yes.

85
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,702
I know she did it.

86
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:38,707
Bedelia was always very unstable,
even when she was much younger.

87
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:44,296
And after the death of her gentleman friend,
she grew steadily worse.

88
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,132
HANK:
Why Father's Day?

89
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,636
Because that was the day of the tragedy,
and she is overwhelmed with her own guilt.

90
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:57,559
She will go to her father's grave
and meditate for about an hour.

91
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,227
And then she will come inside...

92
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:03,940
...and we will all sit down
to a nice baked-ham dinner...

93
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,734
...the three of us--

94
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,529
Oh, I'm so sorry, Henry. The four of us.

95
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:14,451
--who now owe her so very much.

96
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:46,942
NATHAN [IN VOICE-OVER]:
Where's my cake?

97
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:51,404
I want my cake.

98
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:01,873
Where's my cake, Bedelia?

99
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,461
Where's my Father's Day cake?

100
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,923
I want my cake...

101
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,468
...you dirty bitch.

102
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,762
I'm going to have it.

103
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,808
Bedelia!

104
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,812
It's Father's Day.

105
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,439
Where's my cake?

106
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,985
You promised me my cake!

107
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,988
Bedelia, I'm your father...

108
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,615
...and you're supposed to be
taking care of me.

109
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,951
I don't hear you. I said, I don't hear you!

110
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,288
Bedelia, you bitch!

111
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,916
What do you think I've got you here for?

112
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,545
You're just like all the others.

113
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,674
You're nothing but a bunch of vultures.

114
00:09:56,345 --> 00:10:00,890
Bedelia! I want my cake.

115
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,018
Bedelia!

116
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:07,314
Where's my Father's Day cake?

117
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,027
Happy Father's Day!

118
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,636
Don't be stupid.

119
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,726
Happy Father's Day.

120
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,075
God, I didn't know I had it in me.

121
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:04,579
I'm your daughter, right?
You bootlegger. Killer, murderer!

122
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,582
Ungrateful bastard.

123
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,215
Shouldn't have killed Peter, you know.

124
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,092
He was a man, right, a real man.

125
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,887
See, everything I wanted,
he wanted for me.

126
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,766
You stupid bastard. You screwed it all up.

127
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,269
You screwed up my mother,
you screwed me up.

128
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,026
You got me so mad, drove me crazy.

129
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:39,447
"I want my cake, Bedelia. You bitch!"

130
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,158
You called me a bitch.

131
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,536
Sylvia fixed it all.

132
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:49,457
Ashtray back in place, chair overturned.

133
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,962
You took a fall, Daddy, a bad fall.

134
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,715
Nobody could catch us, nobody.

135
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:01,553
You taught me. You taught Sylvia.
You taught us all.

136
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,362
It's so peaceful here.

137
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,577
No! No!

138
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:33,626
Where's my cake, Bedelia?

139
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,799
I want my cake.

140
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:48,516
It's Father's Day, Bedelia.

141
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:52,771
I want my cake.

142
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:18,546
SYLVIA:
Cass! Cass, turn that down!

143
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:23,802
Cass, turn that down
and turn it down right now.

144
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,437
Shall I glaze the ham now, ma'am?

145
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,565
No, Mrs. Danvers, you'll have to wait.

146
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,901
Ms. Grantham has not yet arrived.

147
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,946
And you will remember
that today is a very special day.

148
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,405
Yes, ma'am.

149
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,747
- Ain't life grand, Mrs. D.?
- I do hope she's all right.

150
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,750
Sometimes she loses track of time.

151
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,264
Aunt Bedelia?

152
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,476
Ms. Grantham, are you around?

153
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,575
Jesus.

154
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,509
Where's my cake?

155
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:37,638
I want it. It's mine.

156
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:05,458
- Where is he?
- My dear, I really couldn't say.

157
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:09,170
No doubt he's still out at the grave,

How does $50 sound?

Not a cent less than 200 bucks.

- Two hundred.

Not a cent less than 200.

My meteor, my price.

For a broken meteor?

203
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,157
Mr. Verrill, you must be joking.

00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,054
MAN:
Wentworth?

316
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,349
All right, all right.

317
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,604
MAN: Wentworth?
- All right, I said.

318
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,243
That may work on TV, mister,
but I can bench-press 300 pounds.

319
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:07,247
You'd better get your foot out of the door,
or you're gonna lose about half of it.

320
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,456
Don't call me "mister."

321
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,668
You know damn well who I am,
so let's not play any games, huh?

322
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,338
- Come on, get out of here.
- Listen to me, Harry, and listen carefully.

323
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:19,134
Unless you let me in and talk to me,
something very nasty...

324
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,887
...is going to happen to Rebecca.

325
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:27,100
So nasty that your little mind
can barely conceive of it.

326
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,275
You found out. All right.

327
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,403
Becky and I were gonna sit down
and tell you pretty soon anyway.

328
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,447
You know,
some of these cables are loose.

329
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,242
I'm surprised you didn't notice a change
in the quality of your picture.

330
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,710
You know, you ought to be grateful to us,
you know that?

331
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,087
I mean, if you ever loved her,
you don't now.

332
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:59,049
There won't be alimony,
none of that community-property shit.

333
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,258
She just wants out.

334
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:04,095
Well, I don't know whether I ever loved her
or not, Harry. That doesn't matter.

335
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:08,600
The point is, I keep what is mine.
No exception to that rule ever.

336
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:14,648
No exceptions, Harry. Never.

337
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,488
What did you mean when you said
something nasty was gonna happen?

338
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,157
You really should take better care
of this equipment.

339
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,618
At least get a maintenance cartridge,
and dust.

340
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,579
Talk to me right now.

341
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,333
Take your hand off me right now.

342
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,503
All right, fine.

343
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,175
Got something I want you to hear.

344
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:47,847
WOMAN [ON RECORDING]:
Harry, he's got me in....

345
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:51,476
Please come. Please.

346
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,104
He's got me in....

347
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,523
If you don't come, the....

348
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:00,193
Please, Harry. Please come.

349
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,196
I had to stop it there,
I couldn't bear to record any more.

350
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,740
What have you done with her?

351
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,286
Talk to me, you son of a bitch,
or I'm gonna kill you.

352
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,664
You kill me and you'll never find out.
Now, don't get naughty, Harry.

353
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:16,876
If I fall down on this floor
and hit my head on that hard marble...

354
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,045
...why, I could fracture my skull.

355
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,172
- Fine with me.
- And then you'll never know.

356
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,634
And believe me, Mr. True-Love,
you'll want to know.

357
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,887
Because by 11 this morning,
it's gonna be too late.

358
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,521
VICKERS: I love the ocean,
except when the tide is out.

359
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,858
Then it has that kind of rotten smell.

360
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,402
HARRY: I just don't understand
what you're trying to prove.

361
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,574
VICKERS:
I'm not trying to prove a thing.

362
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:51,745
It may be, on some subjects,
that I'm not entirely sane.

363
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:56,791
The subject of what is mine, for example,
I am not sane at all.

364
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:20,857
Now, this is Comfort Point,
and I call my beach house Comfort Station.

365
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,486
- Is that camp or kitsch, Harry?
HARRY: It's stupid.

366
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:29,449
VICKERS:
Unkind, Harry, unkind.

367
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:33,453
Well, I won't hold it against you.

368
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,413
Come on, up this way.

369
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:45,215
Harry, the maiden fair is waiting
for her knight in shining corduroy.

370
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,133
Come on.

371
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,972
Harry, here's something
I think you'll find interesting.

372
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,392
You see that down there?

373
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,019
Is that...?

374
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,646
What?

375
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,108
The burial mound of my lady fair?

376
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,318
Oh, m--

377
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,821
Could be.

378
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,963
You notice how the water creeps in?

379
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,591
Even when the tide's out,
the water creeps in.

380
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,636
I don't know what the hell
you think you're--

381
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,391
Now, look.

382
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,520
This has gone just about far enough.

383
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,981
No, Harry, not nearly far enough.

384
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,483
Now, if you're thinking
of becoming a hero...

385
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,986
...I suggest that you remember
the lady fair.

386
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,617
Jump into that hole.

387
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,878
- No.
- Then you force me to shoot you, Harry.

388
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,882
Sorry.

389
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,062
Good boy, Harry. Good boy.

390
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,572
Now, Harry, I want you to kneel down...

391
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,824
...and start pulling the sand into the hole.

392
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:40,747
Uh-uh. No way.
Go ahead, shoot me if you want to.

393
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,541
- You're not gonna bury me alive.
- Not a bad idea.

394
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,753
Not exactly what I had in mind, though.

395
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:50,381
All I wanna do is incapacitate you.
Then you can see Becky.

396
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,263
- I don't believe you.
- I always keep my promises, Harry.

397
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,932
And I do have the gun, don't I?

398
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,563
- Help!
- Yell all you want, Harry.

399
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,858
Comfort Point is very private. I own it all.

400
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,569
Help! Help! Help!

401
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,656
Help!

402
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,700
Nobody's gonna hear you, Harry.

403
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,869
Nobody's gonna hear anything.

404
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,209
Now, do what I told you.

405
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,151
There.

406
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,990
Sort of like being buried
in wet cement, huh?

407
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,284
Can't move your arms.

408
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,578
Don't have any leverage.

409
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,330
Go ahead, Harry, try to move.

410
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,134
You know, I could really...

411
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:20,263
...cover you all the way up,
couldn't I, Harry?

412
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:24,892
I could make Harry all gone.

413
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:30,273
Oh, no. No, no, no. I wouldn't do that.

414
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,234
Here, let me get that.

415
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,070
Get that out of you.
There you are. That's good.

416
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,616
No, I keep my promises.

417
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,207
Oh, Jesus. Get out.

418
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:52,795
Get out of here. Just-- Richard!

419
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,885
Richard, would you get it out of here?

420
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,803
Well...

421
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,556
...found a friend, Harry?

422
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:10,396
Hey, come on, Richard. Get it out of here.

423
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,690
He's just getting revenge, Harry...

424
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:17,570
...for all the relatives of his that you ate,
baked and stuffed, at Ma Maison.

425
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,740
Bad fellow, you.
Oh, you bad fellow. Go on.

426
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,742
Get out of there.

427
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,170
Money. Look, I have money.

428
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,800
I'll give you anything.
Just get me out of this hole, all right?

429
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,636
Well, I have something here, Harry.

430
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,970
Take your mind off of it.

431
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:49,519
- Come on, Richard, please--
- It's showtime.

432
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,940
Oh, my-- Becky?

433
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,193
Isn't that great video? I love this stuff.

434
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,987
Now, just look at the quality
of that picture, Harry.

435
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,699
- Somebody!
HARRY: Becky.

436
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,784
- No.
- Becky!

437
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,494
Can't hear you.

438
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:10,164
I'm sorry. She lost a coin toss.
I had to bury her further down the beach.

439
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:13,459
Couldn't even leave her a monitor,
it would have shorted out by now.

440
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:17,255
No, no, no. No, that's a trick.
You son of a bitch!

441
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,091
That's some kind of special-effects trick,
isn't it?

442
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,844
If you'll just take a look
at the VCR back there....

443
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,929
Oh, I'm sorry, you can't turn your head.

444
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:28,766
Let me assure you, Harry,
the VCR is not on "play," it's on "record."

445
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,143
I'm gonna save this stuff.

446
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,562
The two of you
are part of my home movies.

447
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,605
HARRY:
You're insane.

448
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:39,444
- Won't be long now, huh? Not long at all.
- Oh, my God.

449
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,821
You are insane.

450
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,658
I promised that you'd see Becky again.
I kept my promise. Is that insane?

451
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,370
Oh, you bastard. You bastard.

452
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,748
There's a chance
you can get out of this, Harry.

453
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:55,501
The tide might even set you free. It depends
on how long you keep your cool...

454
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,629
...how long you hold your breath,
you see, Harry.

455
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,675
The water's so cold, so salty.

456
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,261
You're underneath,
and you're holding your breath...

457
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,972
...waiting for that wave covering you
to go back out...

458
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,100
...so you can snatch a quick breath...

459
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,188
...before the next wave comes in.

460
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,361
Now, you've got a chance, Harry,
if you don't lose your head.

461
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:26,657
- Now, it looks like she's losing hers.
- Oh, God, no!

462
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:31,579
Feel how hard your heart is beating,
Harry?

463
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,499
How fast?

464
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:38,211
Now, that's gonna make it harder
for you to hold your breath, isn't it?

465
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:43,716
Oh, God.

466
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,844
Oh, the tide.

467
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,472
Coming in.

468
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,517
It's getting late, Harry.

469
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,978
- Guess I'll have to trot along now.
- Wait, wait, wait.

470
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,898
No. You enjoy the show.

471
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,192
At least until the monitor shorts out.

472
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,195
All right, come on, come on.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

473
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:08,115
Sorry, Harry. I really can't stay.

474
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:14,163
- Come on. Come back here, Richard.
- Oh, God.

475
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,670
Come on, Richard!

476
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,052
Come on, Richard, please!

477
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,681
Oh, God.

478
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:36,978
Harry.

479
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,541
No, no.

480
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:56,909
Oh, no! No! No!

481
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,916
No, no, no.

482
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,586
God, no, no, no.

483
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,561
Oh, my God.

484
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,578
HARRY:
Richard.

485
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,794
I'm gonna get you. You hear me, Richard?

486
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:52,590
You hear me, Richard? I'm gonna get you.

487
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,634
You've gotta hold your breath there,
Harry.

488
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,598
Gotta hold your breath.

489
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,528
The current pulled him out.

490
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,551
That's what happened, all right.

491
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:24,140
The current pulled him out. He's gone.

492
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,728
HARRY [IN VOICE-OVER]:
Richard.

493
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:06,265
Never mind where I told you to stand,
you stand where I tell you.

494
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,559
Kid's so dumb,
he doesn't know what time it is.

495
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,853
- By the way, what time is it?
MAN 1: I don't know.

496
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,230
MAN 2:
Stand here and keep your eye on the ball.

497
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:28,621
Now, let me see, where is...?

498
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:33,459
Boy, if that damn maid has been
moving my stuff again, I swear I'll--

499
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,419
HARRY'S VOICE:
Richard.

500
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,372
Undertow has carried them away.

501
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,790
Saved me the trouble.

502
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,760
Come off it.

503
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:36,021
No need to get jumpy.

504
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,856
They're all gone.

505
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,484
Blub, blub, blub.

506
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,147
Who's out there?

507
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,325
Wentworth?

508
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,249
That you, Wentworth?

509
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,628
May I remind you, dear boy,
I have the gun?

510
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,883
Wentworth?

511
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:13,178
I suggest you get out of here...

512
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,471
...or I'll shoot you.

513
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,767
Fair warning.

514
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,812
Wentworth? I'll shoot you dead.

515
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,196
Get out of here, Wentworth.

516
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:48,964
You can't shoot us dead, Richard.

517
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:53,051
Because we're already dead.

518
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,973
We want to see you, Richard.

519
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:02,978
- We want to see you, Richard.
- We want to see you, Richard.

520
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,980
BECKY:
We want to see you.

521
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:09,026
HARRY:
We dug a hole for you, Richard.

522
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,861
BECKY:
On the beach.

523
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,906
HARRY:
Below the high-tide line.

524
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,910
Here we come.

525
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,579
It's showtime!

526
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:26,251
- Here we come, Richard.
- Here we come.

527
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,339
Let's go to the beach.

528
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:35,010
- We just want you to come to the beach.
- We just want you to come to the beach.

529
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,804
-Come with us.
- Come with us.

530
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:41,433
- Come down to the beach.
- Come down to the beach.

531
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,918
If you don't panic...

532
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:11,380
...if you can hold your breath....

533
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:23,016
If you can hold your breath....

534
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:26,603
- If you can hold your breath....
- If you can hold your breath....

535
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:41,743
I can hold my breath...

536
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:46,123
...for a long time!

537
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,542
There, look at that.

538
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,710
Fuck-a-diddle.

539
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,600
What the...?

540
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:59,029
WOMAN:
Oh, Dexter, you are such a child.

541
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,698
You and Henry both.
You're such children.

542
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:05,369
But at least Henry has me
to take care of him, don't you, dear?

543
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:10,082
Tabby, Richard, I'd like you to meet
Dexter Stanley, our distinguished professor...

544
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:13,251
- ...in the Zoology Department.
- Oh, how do--?

545
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,254
Tabby and Richard Raymond.
They're new in the Math Department.

546
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:18,423
How do you do?
What a lovely name you have.

547
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,425
Oh, thank you. Actually, it's Tabitha.

548
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:22,761
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Professor Stanley.

549
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,513
- Just Dex will do.
- Dex. Thank you.

550
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,600
- This is Henry and Wilma Northrup.
- Oh, just call me Billie. Everyone does.

551
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,019
- Billie.
- You need someone to show you the ropes...

552
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:34,690
...you just come see me.
I know all the best stores.

553
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,234
- Well, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

554
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,820
- Pleasure to meet you.
- So are you buying or renting?

555
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:42,906
- Oh, actually, we're renting at the moment.
- It's just as well.

556
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:46,118
Buying real estate in a college town
is a frigging pain in the ass.

557
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:47,327
Take my word for it.

558
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,955
Henry is in the English Department,
and Wilma--

559
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,750
I just take care of Henry.
Believe me, he needs it.

560
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:56,503
Did you ever meet a man who didn't?

561
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:00,340
- What's the matter? You're not drinking?
- Well, actually, we just got here.

562
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,634
Oh, well, we can take care of that.

563
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,721
You just come on with me.
Henry, you stay here till I get back.

564
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:08,557
- Excuse us, please.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

565
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,142
Bye.

566
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:16,022
Oh, honey, these people are dry.
Now, take care of them.

567
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,816
They don't know what they're doing.

568
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:24,656
Hi. Good to see you.

569
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:30,203
If Dex Stanley hadn't had his teeth capped,
he'd have been out on his ass years ago.

570
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:31,413
Really? Well, my--

571
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,666
So when Parker told me
that I was out of line...

572
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:37,461
...I told him he ought to get laid.

573
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:41,173
"I mean, Parker," I said,
"if you'd just have your ashes hauled...

574
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:44,843
...you wouldn't have to spend all this time
playing Emily Vanderbilt."

575
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:49,473
Or Emily Van Buren,
or whoever that etiquette crotch is.

576
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:53,518
- Excuse me.
- I don't know why they keep inviting her.

577
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:57,355
- Hello, Mrs. Forest, ladies.
- Oh, Professor Stanley.

578
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,410
Well, how about tonight?
Maybe we could do it tonight?

579
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:15,791
- Okay. That's great.
- All right, I'll call you about it.

580
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:22,297
I gather you'll be unavailable
for chess tonight.

581
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,178
Henry, you know,
I'm just about reaching a point where I--

582
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,889
Pardon me.
Would one of you be Professor Stanley?

583
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,225
- Yeah, I am.
WOMAN: There's a telephone call for you.

584
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,143
DEXTER:
Oh, yeah, all right. Thank you.

585
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:39,564
It's probably Charlie Gereson again
with his damn ear mites.

586
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,817
He's gonna get the Nobel Prize
before he's 20.

587
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:44,402
Especially if he's working
at Amberson Hall in August.

588
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,404
No, no, he's downstairs. It's cooler.

589
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,452
Yeah, sure, I'll come tonight.

590
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:56,081
- Oh, thanks, Dex.
- Oh, hey, listen, what are friends for?

591
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,751
WILMA:
Just call me Billie. Everyone does.

592
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:09,511
So I thought I ought to call you anyway,
see what you thought, Professor Stanley.

593
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,682
-  Who told you I was here? Charlie Gereson?
-Yeah. I sent him out for a hamburger.

594
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,141
Just about twisted his arm.

595
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:18,103
That kid don't know if it's night or day
when he gets going.

596
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,980
Yeah, he's very dedicated.

597
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:23,817
Look, I'd be almost willing to bet
that crate's full of National Geographics...

598
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,902
...or back issues of the Reader's Digest.

599
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:30,365
Well, the date on it said 1834.

600
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:34,953
Did they publish the Reader's Digest
way back then, Professor Stanley?

601
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:39,249
- 1834? Really?
- Yeah, it's stenciled right on the side.

602
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:42,961
June 19, 1834.

603
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:46,423
And then something about
an arctic expedition.

604
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:50,677
Maybe there's something more interesting
in your crate than National Geographics.

605
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:03,648
Because everyone in the department
is looking to put the knife in you.

606
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:07,694
- I mean, some of these so-called academics--
- Wilma.

607
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:10,780
--make the shark in Jaws
look like fucking Flipper.

608
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:14,326
- Wilma.
- Your husband's calling you, Billie.

609
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,661
Oh, God, Henry, what's wrong now?

610
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:19,664
HENRY:
Not a thing, Wilma.

611
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,793
Everything's just fine.

612
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:40,477
- Hell of a shot.
- Bull's-eye.

613
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,647
WILMA:
Oh, Henry, can't you do anything right?

614
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,274
HENRY: Huh?
- "Huh?"

615
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,610
That's what I figured. "Huh."

616
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,779
That's just what I'd expect from you.

617
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,489
I told you half an hour ago...

618
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:57,118
...to get one of them kids
in the monkey suits to bring the car around.

619
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,037
Oh, I'm sorry.

620
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:03,208
Oh, Henry, you are such a little kid.

621
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,543
I swear to God, you are.

622
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:08,463
I mean, where would you be
without me to take care of you?

623
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:21,434
DEXTER: I'm still betting your crate's
full of old magazines and just plain junk.

624
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,479
All the same, though....

625
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,524
An arctic expedition.

626
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,442
And that date.

627
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:32,821
Yeah, kind of gets you, doesn't it?

628
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,991
Yeah, it kind of does.

629
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,910
- I'm sorry.
- Got it.

630
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:40,662
MIKE:
It's kind of heavy.

631
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,915
I'll just swing this end around.

632
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,713
Yeah. Move it over here.

633
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,132
DEXTER: I'm surprised you didn't
open this thing yourself.

634
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:54,551
MIKE:
No, I figured that was for you.

635
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,594
DEXTER: How come you didn't tell
Charlie Gereson?

636
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:58,555
Well, he's just a grad student.

637
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:01,057
And with Professor Tirrell
being over in England...

638
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:03,435
...I figure you're the boss.

639
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,694
- Hold this on it, will you?
- Yeah.

640
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,283
What made you look under here, anyway?

641
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:20,285
I flipped a quarter trying to decide...

642
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:23,955
...if I should buff the second-floor hallway
first or wash the lab windows.

643
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:28,209
Only when it came down, I missed it,
and it rolled under here.

644
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,964
Oh, there it is.

645
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,092
Probably would have let it go...

646
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:39,471
...only that was my last quarter
for the Coke machine.

647
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:47,645
It's not very nice in there, is it?
God, I hate tight places.

648
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:54,944
- Are you okay, doc?
- Yeah.

649
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:14,089
Help me out with this, will you?
I think we might really have something here.

650
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:17,217
All right. Okay?

651
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,688
DEXTER:
Put it right on this table here.

652
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:48,373
- What's wrong?
- It felt like something shifted in there.

653
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,708
Did you feel it
when we lifted it on the table?

654
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,378
I did feel something under the stairs.
It felt heavy.

655
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:57,549
Yeah, but it seemed like
something moved on its own.

656
01:08:57,716 --> 01:09:01,344
Well, if there ever really were
any living specimens in there...

657
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:06,057
...I doubt if they're feeling very lively after,
what, 147 years?

658
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:09,227
Oh, yeah. Sure.

659
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,438
I guess I must be spending too much time
in the sun, huh, doc?

660
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:15,483
- Well, let's get this open, shall we?
- Yeah.

661
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:19,362
I got a hammer and chisel out in the closet.
Just wait while I go get them.

662
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,407
Yeah. Hit those lights, will you, Mike?

663
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:33,251
And don't just leave the pots soaking
like you did last time.

664
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:35,545
Scrub them and put them away.

665
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,339
Just because you
and your intellectual friend...

666
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:42,010
...are gonna play chess, doesn't mean
you have to leave a mess for me.

667
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:45,763
Wipe the stove.

668
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:47,765
Yes, Billie.

669
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:52,729
And kindly have him out of here
before I get back from my classes.

670
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:57,275
But frankly, that tobacco he smokes
makes me wanna ralph.

671
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:04,782
Yes, Billie. Yes.

672
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,076
"Yes, Billie. Yes, Billie."

673
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:12,707
Oh, Henry.
What would you do without me?

674
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,460
I don't know, Billie.

675
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,798
Well, on that we're even.

676
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,594
Enjoy your chess.

677
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:35,647
- I bet they're worth something, huh, doc?
- Yeah.

678
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:38,608
Doc.

679
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:42,111
No, no. Be my guest, Mike. It's your find.

680
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:45,573
You're right. There's probably
nothing in there but rocks and plants...

681
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,700
...that'll turn to dust if you touch them.

682
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:51,829
- But I'm pretty hot to see, just the same.
- To tell you the truth, so am I.

683
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:56,251
Doc, it's loosening up. Could you...?

684
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,253
Yeah, sure.

685
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:05,320
Christ, I can't see a frigging thing.

686
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:09,157
Where did I leave my flashlight?
Do you remember, doc?

687
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:13,244
Never mind.
Let's just get this last nail out of there.

688
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,708
MIKE:
Do you hear that?

689
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,131
There's something in there, doc.

690
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:29,010
There's something shiny.

691
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,803
Christ.

692
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:33,181
- It looks like a couple of emeralds.
- Don't!

693
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,102
Help me, doc! Help me, doc!

694
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:41,022
God, it's biting. Help me!

695
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:48,446
Oh, God.

696
01:12:52,659 --> 01:13:04,962
Mike.

697
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:55,805
- Oh, Jesus. Charlie. Charlie!
- Professor Stanley, what--?

698
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,224
The janitor. The crate.

699
01:13:58,392 --> 01:13:59,684
It was-- It was....

700
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:02,520
What happened? Professor, slow down.

701
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:05,523
Charlie, listen,
we gotta get the campus security.

702
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:08,985
- We gotta get the--
- Slow down, Professor Stanley, slow down.

703
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:11,779
I don't know what you're talking about.

704
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:16,534
Charlie, it's the-- You know the janitor?
You know Mike, the janitor?

705
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:19,996
- Yes, of course I do.
- Well....

706
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:52,320
It just sucked him in.

707
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:58,201
- That's pretty far out, Professor Stanley.
- It's true, it's true. I swear to God, it's true.

708
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:03,414
- Come on, we gotta get the campus police.
- No, campus security's no good.

709
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:07,126
If I'm having trouble swallowing this,
what the fuck are they going to think?

710
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:14,467
I don't know what they would think.

711
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:18,471
They'd think you'd been off
on a hell of a toot.

712
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:21,098
- But, Charlie....
- No, no.

713
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,976
They'd think we'd both been off
on a hell of a toot.

714
01:15:24,144 --> 01:15:27,855
Got you seeing Tasmanian devils
instead of pink elephants.

715
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:31,776
I think I'll go down...

716
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,736
...and see how the land lays.

717
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:37,949
- No, don't! It may be out.
- No, I doubt that.

718
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:42,453
- Charlie, please don't go down there.
- Be right back, Professor Stanley.

719
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,334
He'll see it.

720
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:52,880
He'll see the crate, he'll see the blood,
he'll see Mike, and then he'll believe me.

721
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:58,553
Charlie.

722
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:01,472
Charlie?

723
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:12,275
There, see the blood?
Do you think I'm crazy now?

724
01:16:17,322 --> 01:16:20,658
You think that I killed him?
Look at the blood. Look--

725
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:23,744
It's gone.

726
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,956
- What's gone?
- The....

727
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,502
It got out.

728
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:35,381
I thought it would be potbound
after all these years, but it got out.

729
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:40,094
It pushed the crate off the table.
From the way this track looks....

730
01:16:45,976 --> 01:16:49,020
It pushed the crate back in
under the stairs...

731
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:51,105
...where it felt safe for so long.

732
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,526
Hey, Charlie.

733
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:04,368
Charlie, I really think--

734
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:41,489
Charlie, listen, don't go in there.
If you had seen that thing....

735
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,324
Don't worry.

736
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:47,244
Christ.

737
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:56,253
It looks like it's been through a hay baler.

738
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:58,089
Now do you believe me?

739
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:02,259
Charlie, don't go near it.

740
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:04,720
I don't want the crate...

741
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:07,932
...I want that shoe.

742
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,768
I wanna measure the bite marks.

743
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:14,939
Maybe we can figure out...

744
01:18:16,608 --> 01:18:18,734
...what we're dealing with here.

745
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:04,822
No, Charlie!

746
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,006
We gotta--

747
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,176
We gotta stop it. We gotta stop it.

748
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,011
- What?
- Two people are dead already.

749
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:30,681
We gotta-- Dear Christ, they died.

750
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:33,684
Hey, Dex. Dex, hold it.

751
01:19:35,645 --> 01:19:38,272
- What happened?
- Two people are dead already.

752
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:41,025
- And....
- Who's dead?

753
01:19:42,986 --> 01:19:45,696
- Where's Wilma?
- She's gone. Dex, what the--?

754
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,281
What the hell happened to you?

755
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:50,993
Two people are dead,
and I could be blamed.

756
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:55,498
I know that's a terrible consideration
to have at a time like this, Henry....

757
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,170
HENRY:
Good God.

758
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:04,590
Last time I saw someone do that
was in the movies.

759
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:07,051
It could be my ass, Henry,
and it wasn't me.

760
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:10,930
It was that thing in the-- in the crate.

761
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:14,099
I don't even know what it was.

762
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:16,644
What two people? Who is dead?

763
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:23,484
Mike, the janitor in Amberson Hall...

764
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,028
...and Charlie Gereson.

765
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:29,740
He wanted to measure the bite marks,
Henry.

766
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:32,034
I guess he got his chance.

767
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,620
- I certainly guess he did.
- Dex, Dex.

768
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,789
Dex, I can't do anything for you...

769
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:39,250
...unless you stop being
so goddamned elliptical.

770
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:43,212
Now, just slow down.
Tell me the whole story from the beginning.

771
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,714
- Can you do that?
- All right. All right.

772
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:47,800
I think I can do that now.

773
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,511
Oh, thank God for you, Henry.

774
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:59,562
I had a hundred crazy ideas
about how to get rid of it coming over here.

775
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:01,438
I kept thinking about Ryder's Quarry.

776
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:03,107
- You know that place?
- I know it.

777
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:05,276
I kept thinking
that would be deep enough...

778
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:08,112
...if only there was a way
to get that crate over there.

779
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,781
You know, I kept thinking if we....

780
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,910
I don't know anymore.

781
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,290
Am I going crazy, Henry?

782
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:21,542
No.

783
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:28,465
I have to use the facilities, Dex.

784
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:30,718
I'll be back in a minute.

785
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:35,055
And then we'll decide
what we need to do.

786
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:39,560
- Thanks, Henry.
- Well, what are friends for?

787
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:52,990
- Let's get you another drink, Dex.
- No, no, no, I've had enough.

788
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:56,160
It's a wonder
I'm not plastered out of my gourd.

789
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:57,953
Shock, I guess.

790
01:21:58,121 --> 01:22:01,415
Just one more for the both of us
while we talk this over.

791
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:05,669
- We may need it.
- Yeah, okay.

792
01:22:58,348 --> 01:23:00,641
My God.

793
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:57,299
Henry, goddamn it!

794
01:24:57,467 --> 01:25:01,178
How many times have I told you
to lock the goddamn door?

795
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:13,148
Henry.

796
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:32,501
HENRY: Wilma, I've had to leave in a hurry
because of a call from Dexter Stanley.

797
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:36,130
He seems to have gotten himself
in a great deal of trouble.

798
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:41,135
I'm ashamed to tell you of this,
but ever since Dexter's wife died...

799
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:45,889
...he's had problems coping
with certain young female grad students.

800
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:48,225
He's been able to cover up
several incidents...

801
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:51,395
...but this one looks very serious.

802
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:59,236
It seems he got a young woman
to accompany him to Amberson Hall...

803
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,738
...under false pretenses
and then attacked her.

804
01:26:05,785 --> 01:26:08,412
When Dex called me,
he was barely coherent.

805
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:12,082
He was gibbering with fear
and crying, I think.

806
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,126
Aw. Poor Dex.

807
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:17,171
I tried to get him to tell me
what had happened to the girl...

808
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,590
...but for the most part,
he only kept repeating:

809
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:22,885
"It's awful, Henry. It's awful."

810
01:26:23,052 --> 01:26:25,387
Wilma, could you come out here?

811
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:27,890
I know it's asking a lot...

812
01:26:28,057 --> 01:26:31,018
...but you're always so clear-headed
about these things...

813
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:33,604
...and you know how to be firm.

814
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:37,900
I think Dex could use a firmer hand
than mine right now.

815
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:40,611
Not to mention the girl herself.

816
01:26:41,112 --> 01:26:46,074
He said that she had curled up
in a dark place and won't come out.

817
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:51,622
I'm sorry to have to ask you to come over
to Amberson Hall and help me out...

818
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:56,210
...but as you so often say,
what would I do without you?

819
01:26:56,377 --> 01:27:00,005
What indeed, Henry? What indeed?

820
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:10,701
WILMA:
Henry?

821
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:19,751
Henry?

822
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,300
Henry, where are you?

823
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:28,051
HENRY:
The laboratory, Wilma.

824
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:30,137
Downstairs.

825
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:59,041
What are you doing
creeping around down there?

826
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:02,544
Where's Dex?

827
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:05,756
What kind of a mess
has he gotten himself into?

828
01:29:05,923 --> 01:29:11,094
Well, it's easier if I just show you, I think.
Come on down.

829
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:18,435
- What's this?
- Oh, I found them in the....

830
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:21,104
Oh, Henry.

831
01:29:21,272 --> 01:29:23,440
Did he beat her?

832
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:24,941
Well....

833
01:29:25,109 --> 01:29:28,362
Well, how bad is she? Is she conscious?

834
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:43,418
HENRY: I think it's easier
if you just see for yourself, Wilma.

835
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,797
What are you laughing about?

836
01:29:48,424 --> 01:29:52,135
Your best friend gets in a scrape with a girl
and you're laughing?

837
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:55,138
Well, there is a funny side to it, Wilma.

838
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:58,100
Wait till you see. You'll think so yourself.

839
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:03,772
You're hysterical, Henry.
It's just what I would have expected.

840
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:08,902
No, I don't think you'll expect this,
Wilma.

841
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:13,490
No, this is going to be
an entirely new experience.

842
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:17,661
What are you doing, Henry?
Let go of me. Henry.

843
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:21,581
What's going on?
The lab's the other way.

844
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:27,003
The lab, yes,
but the girl is under the stairs, Billie.

845
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:31,007
Wait till you see. That's what's so funny.

846
01:30:31,467 --> 01:30:35,929
The girl has crawled under the stairs,
and she won't come out.

847
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:38,890
She's all curled up,
you know, like a little baby.

848
01:30:39,058 --> 01:30:42,060
- Oh, Henry.
- And making funny sounds and....

849
01:30:42,228 --> 01:30:43,645
What did he do to her?

850
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:46,189
Well....

851
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:51,194
You can get her out, Billie.

852
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:52,779
I know you can get her out.

853
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:55,991
Why don't you give it a try?

854
01:30:57,076 --> 01:31:02,414
You always know how to handle
these things, Billie, no problem.

855
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:03,707
No trouble.

856
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:06,209
I know you can get her out.

857
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:11,339
What are you doing, Henry?
What are you doing?

858
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:15,552
What I should have done a long time ago.
Get in there, Wilma.

859
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:18,305
Just tell it to call you Billie, you bitch.

860
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,891
Stop it. Stop it, Henry. I'll scream.

861
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:24,269
Oh, scream all you want. I'll help you.
Wake up!

862
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:28,982
Wake up, whatever you are.
Wake up, wake up! Dinnertime!

863
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:34,988
Poison meat!
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

864
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:40,368
Wake up. Wake up. Wake....

865
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:52,756
Well, that was great, Henry.
That was just great.

866
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:54,758
You think this is a Friday-night fight?

867
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,718
Huh?

868
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:57,928
Is that what you think?

869
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:01,765
You wanna see some real punching?

870
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,941
Same old Henry,
afraid of your own shadow.

871
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:16,071
You know what, Henry?
You're a regular barnyard exhibit.

872
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:21,493
Sheep's eyes, chicken guts,
piggy friends...

873
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:23,620
...and shit for brains.

874
01:32:24,455 --> 01:32:28,833
No good at departmental politics,
no good at making money...

875
01:32:29,001 --> 01:32:31,628
...no good at making an impression
on anybody.

876
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:36,800
And no good at all in bed.

877
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:39,636
When was the last time you got it up,
Henry, huh?

878
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:43,473
When was the last time
you were a man in our bed?

879
01:32:43,641 --> 01:32:45,100
Now, get out of my way, Henry...

880
01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:48,144
...or I swear to God
you'll be wearing your balls for earrings.

881
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:51,898
And I swear to God,
if you ever touch me again--

882
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:05,412
Oh, just-- Just tell it to call you Billie.

883
01:35:02,613 --> 01:35:04,781
HENRY:
I didn't see anyone, not a soul.

884
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:09,577
At this time of the year and no other,
the campus is almost totally deserted.

885
01:35:09,745 --> 01:35:13,665
The summer session is over, and the fall
semester doesn't start for two more weeks.

886
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:15,917
It was almost hellishly perfect.

887
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:18,545
I never saw so much
as a pair of headlights.

888
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:22,215
"Henry, what did you do with the crate?
The crate?"

889
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:24,092
That's the beauty of it.

890
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:27,470
You provided the final piece
in the jigsaw puzzle yourself.

891
01:35:27,638 --> 01:35:30,640
The crate is at the bottom
of Ryder's Quarry.

892
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:33,977
I drove out there with the remains
of three human beings.

893
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:36,312
Well, two human beings and Wilma.

894
01:35:37,314 --> 01:35:39,899
I began to wonder, where did they go?

895
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:42,819
I mean, how much could it eat?

896
01:35:44,196 --> 01:35:47,157
I think maybe at the very end...

897
01:35:47,324 --> 01:35:49,743
...it began to suspect
what was happening.

898
01:36:28,365 --> 01:36:32,327
So the question is, what happens now?

899
01:36:34,663 --> 01:36:37,999
There's no evidence of foul play,
I've seen to that.

900
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:41,211
And there are no bodies.

901
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:44,047
No.

902
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:46,633
No, I don't suppose there are.

903
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:51,179
So, what about you, Dexter?

904
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,681
What are you gonna say?

905
01:36:57,394 --> 01:36:58,394
Nothing.

906
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:02,565
Thanks. Thank you, Dexter.

907
01:37:04,109 --> 01:37:06,236
No need to thank me.

908
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:09,656
After all, what are friends for?

909
01:37:12,326 --> 01:37:15,745
You understand, of course,
that I expect to whip your ass at chess...

910
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:19,123
...twice a week for the rest of our lives.

911
01:37:19,291 --> 01:37:22,877
We'll have to see about that, won't we?

912
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,847
I haven't done anything to anybody.

913
01:37:36,308 --> 01:37:37,559
Neither have I.

914
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:43,356
What if I had waked up
before you got here and called the police?

915
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:47,110
You didn't.

916
01:37:50,656 --> 01:37:53,116
What if it gets out, Henry?

917
01:37:53,659 --> 01:37:55,451
What if it gets out of that crate?

918
01:37:57,746 --> 01:38:00,915
If you saw the way I chained it up,
you wouldn't worry.

919
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:04,878
That thing is drowned in its box
70 feet down.

920
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:08,798
So relax.

921
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:11,968
Relax.

922
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:24,666
Bastards.

923
01:39:27,753 --> 01:39:29,712
Goddamn bugs.

924
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:32,173
I'll get them bugs.

925
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:34,425
I own this goddamn building.

926
01:39:34,593 --> 01:39:37,679
There's not going to be
any more damn bugs.

927
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:54,195
Heads are going to roll,
I promise you that.

928
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:55,905
Oh, yes.

929
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:05,581
- Hello, is that you, White?
MAN: No, sir, Mr. Pratt.

930
01:40:05,749 --> 01:40:08,835
This is George Gendron here.
I just got off the plane from Seattle.

931
01:40:09,003 --> 01:40:10,920
I have my report ready for typing and I--

932
01:40:11,088 --> 01:40:14,090
The building superintendent
is on vacation, George.

933
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:16,551
- Sir?
- You believe that? Vacation.

934
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:19,095
- Well, I--
- I told them I wanted to hear from him...

935
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:22,598
...within the hour. Within the hour.
And he now has--

936
01:40:22,766 --> 01:40:25,435
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
It's 9:34 p.m.

937
01:40:25,602 --> 01:40:27,353
--exactly 26 minutes to go...

938
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:31,107
...or he can stay on vacation permanently.
Bastard.

939
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:34,444
MAN: Mr. Pratt, I got to the office here
and found a telex from Seattle...

940
01:40:34,611 --> 01:40:35,945
...I thought you'd want to--

941
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:38,948
What are you doing in the office
at 9:30, George?

942
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:41,784
There's no overtime at
the executive level, you know.

943
01:40:41,952 --> 01:40:44,620
Yes, I know that.
It's about the Pacific Aerodyne takeover.

944
01:40:44,788 --> 01:40:47,540
Bugger Pacific Aerodyne.
They're done for. They've had it.

945
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:49,459
Norman Castonmeyer is a dinosaur.

946
01:40:49,626 --> 01:40:52,587
He's too fucking blind to find his way
into the nearest tar pit.

947
01:40:52,755 --> 01:40:53,796
But, Mr. Pratt--

948
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:56,549
Air-pollution count's
up to almost 7, George.

949
01:40:57,468 --> 01:41:01,054
People are dying of carbon-monoxide
poisoning, and they don't even know it.

950
01:41:01,221 --> 01:41:02,263
Yes, sir, but--

951
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:04,766
Oh, I found another cockroach
this evening, George.

952
01:41:04,933 --> 01:41:06,642
- Oh, no.
- One of those big ones...

953
01:41:06,810 --> 01:41:10,104
...right here in my $3200-a-month
penthouse apartment.

954
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:12,982
My supposedly germ-proof apartment.

955
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:16,694
Now, would you like to tell me, George,
how an apartment can be germ-proof...

956
01:41:16,862 --> 01:41:20,740
...when it's not even bug-proof?

957
01:41:21,366 --> 01:41:24,827
Well, I guess it can't, Mr. Pratt.
But I wanted you to know...

958
01:41:24,995 --> 01:41:29,082
...that Pratt International now owns
a majority of Pacific Aerodyne's stock.

959
01:41:29,249 --> 01:41:32,168
Of course we do.
I can't talk to you now, George.

960
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:36,172
I'm gonna clear up this damn cockroach
problem once and for all. Bastards.

961
01:41:47,142 --> 01:41:49,185
I'm not gonna have any bugs
in my building.

962
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:51,854
I loathe bugs.

963
01:41:52,022 --> 01:41:53,898
- Yes, sir, but, Mr.--
- Loathe them.

964
01:41:54,066 --> 01:41:55,900
But there's something you should know--

965
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:59,862
I've gotta let you go, George.
You did well.

966
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:02,281
Go out and fuck somebody.
But wear a damn rubber.

967
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:04,408
Everybody's got the damn herpes
these days.

968
01:42:04,576 --> 01:42:08,830
Sir, Norman Castonmeyer
shot himself an hour ago.

969
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:14,043
- What?
- He did it when....

970
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:18,464
Well, when it became clear
there was no way to stop the takeover.

971
01:42:18,632 --> 01:42:22,343
At least, that's what his wife thinks.

972
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:25,555
Wonderful.

973
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:29,392
Now we won't have to offer the old fart
a seat on the board of directors.

974
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:30,643
Yeah.

975
01:42:31,061 --> 01:42:35,940
Now, get off the phone, George.
Never run good news into the ground.

976
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:38,818
I've got this bug problem.

977
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:43,072
Once you get bugs,
you never get rid of them.

978
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:48,578
They breed in the crawl spaces,
in the conduits...

979
01:42:49,037 --> 01:42:52,123
...in the very core of the building itself.

980
01:42:55,002 --> 01:42:58,588
Mr. Pratt?

981
01:42:59,506 --> 01:43:01,716
Goodbye, George.

982
01:43:01,884 --> 01:43:04,051
Yes, sir. Good night, Mr. Pratt.

983
01:43:28,785 --> 01:43:31,954
Once they get a foothold in the building,
you never get rid of them.

984
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:52,016
Bastards.

985
01:43:55,979 --> 01:43:58,189
Reynolds? White?

986
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:00,149
Talk to me.

987
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:05,154
WOMAN: I just called to tell you
what a monster you are, Mr. Pratt...

988
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:09,325
...and how I will rejoice
when you're finally dead.

989
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:12,411
Lots of people are gonna rejoice
when I'm dead.

990
01:44:12,579 --> 01:44:16,832
- Who are you?
- Lenora Castonmeyer.

991
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:21,212
I'm the wife of the man you murdered
this afternoon.

992
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:23,839
Mrs. Castonmeyer. How are you?

993
01:44:24,007 --> 01:44:27,843
I hope they keep hell hot for you,
you son of a bitch...

994
01:44:28,011 --> 01:44:29,136
...I hope they do.

995
01:44:29,304 --> 01:44:32,098
It wasn't enough for you
to drive him to his knees, was it?

996
01:44:32,266 --> 01:44:34,183
No, you had to kill him as well.

997
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:38,479
He came home, and his eyes....

998
01:44:38,647 --> 01:44:41,023
His eyes were so dead.

999
01:44:41,191 --> 01:44:43,317
I asked him what was wrong.

1000
01:44:43,485 --> 01:44:48,823
What could be so bad
to make his eyes look that way?

1001
01:44:48,991 --> 01:44:54,537
And the only word he could say
was your name.

1002
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:58,457
Ten minutes later, I heard the shot.

1003
01:44:58,625 --> 01:45:02,878
Yes, George Gendron told me
old Norman went out with a bang.

1004
01:45:03,046 --> 01:45:05,047
How many men have you destroyed?

1005
01:45:05,215 --> 01:45:07,466
How many men have you killed,
you monster?

1006
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:09,302
Only the stupid ones.

1007
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:13,556
Only the ones who handed me a knife
and then stretched out their throats.

1008
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:18,728
Only the ones who,
if you'll pardon the expression, fucked up.

1009
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:23,065
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got this bug problem...

1010
01:45:23,233 --> 01:45:26,819
...so we'll have to defer your charming
conversation for another time.

1011
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:29,405
- I hope you die.
- By the way--

1012
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:32,074
I hope you get cancer in the worst place.

1013
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:34,869
- Mrs. Castonmeyer--
- Leprosy.

1014
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:37,747
- Scream in hell forever, you monster.
- Mrs. Castonjammer...

1015
01:45:37,914 --> 01:45:40,708
...would you mind telling me
who gave you my private number?

1016
01:45:40,876 --> 01:45:41,917
I'd like to fire him.

1017
01:45:42,085 --> 01:45:45,087
It was in my husband's address book,
you son of a bitch.

1018
01:45:45,922 --> 01:45:48,174
Well, I can't fire him, can I?

1019
01:46:02,564 --> 01:46:04,857
That better be you, Reynolds.

1020
01:46:09,613 --> 01:46:11,697
- Talk to me.
MAN: It's Carl Reynolds, sir.

1021
01:46:11,865 --> 01:46:15,826
- I'm calling from Orlando, Florida.
- Orlando? Florida?

1022
01:46:15,994 --> 01:46:19,538
Yes, the wife and I decided to take the kids
to Disney World this year--

1023
01:46:19,706 --> 01:46:22,583
I don't give a fuck if you decided
to take the kids to Attica.

1024
01:46:22,751 --> 01:46:24,960
There are still roaches in this place,
Reynolds.

1025
01:46:25,128 --> 01:46:28,214
- I killed one not five minutes ago.
- I see. I....

1026
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:30,299
Do you like your job, Reynolds?

1027
01:46:30,467 --> 01:46:32,968
Sir, I've spoken to Mr. White,
who's on desk tonight.

1028
01:46:33,136 --> 01:46:36,013
- Do you like your job, Reynolds?
- Yes, sir.

1029
01:46:36,181 --> 01:46:38,724
I'm glad to hear it,
because I wanna see White.

1030
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:42,770
- Mr. Pratt, it's almost quarter of ten--
- And if I don't first see White...

1031
01:46:42,938 --> 01:46:45,981
...and then the exterminators
within the space of a half an hour...

1032
01:46:46,149 --> 01:46:48,734
...you will have no job by midnight tonight,
understand?

1033
01:46:48,902 --> 01:46:52,571
Next year you can take the wife and kids
to Disney World on your welfare check.

1034
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:55,991
Have you got that?
Are we together on this?

1035
01:46:57,327 --> 01:47:01,205
- Yes, sir.
- Good, I trust we are. Goodbye.

1036
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:11,632
You have to watch them.

1037
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:13,467
Oh, yes.

1038
01:47:13,635 --> 01:47:16,554
Castonmeyer, Reynolds...

1039
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:18,597
...bugs.

1040
01:47:19,516 --> 01:47:21,350
That's all they are.

1041
01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:23,144
All of them.

1042
01:47:31,194 --> 01:47:33,988
And although
they're essentially brainless...

1043
01:47:34,156 --> 01:47:36,157
...you have to watch them...

1044
01:47:36,825 --> 01:47:40,453
...because they creep up on you.

1045
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:45,040
They creep up on you.

1046
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:29,835
PRATT:
Talk to me. Who's there?

1047
01:48:30,003 --> 01:48:32,963
Good evening there, Mr. Pratt.

1048
01:48:33,131 --> 01:48:35,841
Got bugs again, huh, Mr. Pratt?

1049
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:39,845
- Don't you talk to me like that, you hear?
- What way, Mr. Pratt?

1050
01:48:40,013 --> 01:48:41,555
Like I was crazy.

1051
01:48:41,723 --> 01:48:44,600
Oh, no, sir, Mr. Pratt, sir.

1052
01:48:44,768 --> 01:48:47,853
I don't think you is crazy. Not at all.

1053
01:48:48,021 --> 01:48:50,189
I was just trying to run down
in my mind...

1054
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:53,275
...who might have
a 24-hour fumigating service.

1055
01:48:53,443 --> 01:48:59,240
I might be able to get Pirelli Brothers
out here by, shall we say, 11:30?

1056
01:48:59,407 --> 01:49:01,033
You might go far, White.

1057
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:06,664
I've noticed that in service jobs,
people like yourself often do.

1058
01:49:06,831 --> 01:49:10,709
People of color.
Yes, 11:30 would be fine.

1059
01:49:11,294 --> 01:49:14,463
Thanks, Mr. Pratt, sir.

1060
01:49:14,631 --> 01:49:19,260
I'll call them just as soon as I finish
with that shower on 23.

1061
01:49:19,427 --> 01:49:23,973
- Do it first. Do it now.
- Yes, sir. Right now.

1062
01:49:29,813 --> 01:49:31,689
Only stunned.

1063
01:49:31,856 --> 01:49:34,149
That's the explanation.

1064
01:49:34,401 --> 01:49:39,071
Roaches are very hard to kill,
and they're quick.

1065
01:49:39,239 --> 01:49:41,407
They can creep up on you.

1066
01:49:41,825 --> 01:49:44,577
They can creep up on you if you let them.

1067
01:50:02,971 --> 01:50:07,516
See, Mrs. Castonmeyer,
I grew up in Hell' s Kitchen.

1068
01:50:07,684 --> 01:50:08,851
Bugs everywhere.

1069
01:50:09,519 --> 01:50:12,855
I know what to do with a bug
when I see it.

1070
01:50:13,273 --> 01:50:17,443
Spray it. Squash it. Kill it.

1071
01:50:22,532 --> 01:50:24,825
What the fuck?

1072
01:50:25,243 --> 01:50:27,995
Another son-of-a-bitching blackout.

1073
01:50:29,539 --> 01:50:33,000
If it was my power company,
this would never happen.

1074
01:50:38,214 --> 01:50:41,634
Bastards. Goddamn bugs.

1075
01:50:44,012 --> 01:50:45,888
Bastards!

1076
01:50:49,392 --> 01:50:52,686
Fucking roaches. Goddamn b--

1077
01:50:53,229 --> 01:50:59,151
Bug bastards.
I'll kill you, you goddamn little bug-eyed--

1078
01:51:23,927 --> 01:51:26,387
Come on, come on, come on.
What do I pay you for?

1079
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:32,434
MAN:
Police, Emergency.

1080
01:51:32,602 --> 01:51:35,104
It's about time.
What are you people doing down there?

1081
01:51:35,271 --> 01:51:36,772
We got problems tonight, fella.

1082
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:40,567
- Or haven't you looked out your window?
- Listen, this is the Upson Pratt.

1083
01:51:40,735 --> 01:51:41,777
I've got bugs.

1084
01:51:41,945 --> 01:51:45,280
Everybody's got bugs tonight,
and I don't have time for bullshit.

1085
01:51:45,448 --> 01:51:47,950
No, no, you don't understand.
These are cockroaches.

1086
01:51:48,618 --> 01:51:52,621
The biggest ones I've ever seen.
It has gotta stop. It's gotta stop!

1087
01:51:52,789 --> 01:51:55,958
On a slow night we could talk about it,
but this isn't a slow night--

1088
01:51:56,126 --> 01:51:58,460
I don't think you understand
who you're talking to.

1089
01:51:58,628 --> 01:52:00,963
This is Upson Pratt. Upson Pratt!

1090
01:52:02,799 --> 01:52:05,884
I'll have your job, you asshole.
I'll have your--

1091
01:52:09,723 --> 01:52:12,099
White. White, talk to me.

1092
01:52:12,267 --> 01:52:15,769
White. White, I know you can hear me.
The PA's on the emergency circuit.

1093
01:52:15,937 --> 01:52:17,396
White, talk to me.

1094
01:52:18,022 --> 01:52:22,651
-Mr. Pratt, I'm stuck in the damn elevator.
-You can't be stuck in the elevator.

1095
01:52:22,819 --> 01:52:25,571
I want you up here now.
There are roaches, hundreds of them.

1096
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:28,657
I'm gonna be here
till the power comes on. Sorry.

1097
01:52:28,825 --> 01:52:31,493
I'll have your job, you black bastard.

1098
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:55,017
Come on, come on.

1099
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:03,150
You'll never get in here. Never.

1100
01:53:03,318 --> 01:53:06,487
And when this blackout is over,
people are gonna pay. Oh, yes.

1101
01:53:06,654 --> 01:53:10,866
And you'll pay too, every one of you.
Every damn one of you.

1102
01:53:11,868 --> 01:53:15,078
I've been beating bugs all my life,
and I'll beat you too.

1103
01:53:15,246 --> 01:53:16,413
Bastards. Ba--

1104
01:53:18,708 --> 01:53:20,209
Talk to me.

1105
01:53:23,338 --> 01:53:27,716
WOMAN: Pratt, you old monster.
Oh, I hope you die.

1106
01:53:28,259 --> 01:53:32,387
I hope you die.

1107
01:53:45,693 --> 01:53:48,862
I hope you die.

1108
01:53:49,030 --> 01:53:52,950
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:
It's 1 0:29-- It's 1 0-- It's 1 1 -- It's 1 2--

1109
01:53:53,117 --> 01:53:55,702
It's 1 -- It's 2-- Four-- One-- It's 2--

1110
01:53:55,870 --> 01:54:00,249
Three-- Four-- It's 4-- Four-- Two--
It's 4-- Four-- Three-- Four-- Four--

1111
01:54:12,428 --> 01:54:14,137
WHITE:
Mr. Pratt?

1112
01:54:14,305 --> 01:54:16,640
You there, Mr. Pratt?

1113
01:54:16,891 --> 01:54:19,434
Mr. Pratt? Talk to me.

1114
01:54:20,854 --> 01:54:23,897
Talk to me, talk to me. Honky bastard.

1115
01:54:25,275 --> 01:54:30,112
What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?
Bugs got your tongue?

1116
01:54:55,805 --> 01:54:59,933
Mr. Pratt.

1117
01:55:00,476 --> 01:55:02,102
Bastard.

1118
01:55:42,226 --> 01:55:44,853
Now eat, you bigmouth.

1119
01:55:50,485 --> 01:55:53,862
Chew your food before you swallow.

1120
01:55:55,740 --> 01:55:57,741
-What's that?
-It's a comic book.

1121
01:55:57,909 --> 01:55:58,951
What?

1122
01:55:59,118 --> 01:56:00,661
-It's a comic book.
-What?

1123
01:56:00,828 --> 01:56:02,871
-It's a comic book!
-A comic book!

1124
01:56:03,373 --> 01:56:05,749
MAN 1: My kids love these things.
MAN 2: I love them too.

1125
01:56:05,917 --> 01:56:08,710
Hey, look, look.
You can send away for all this stuff here.

1126
01:56:08,878 --> 01:56:11,546
-Look, x-ray glasses.
-They don't work.

1127
01:56:11,714 --> 01:56:14,716
They make your eyes black.
You look in and it's a gag, you know?

1128
01:56:16,219 --> 01:56:19,471
Look, an authentic voodoo doll.

1129
01:56:19,639 --> 01:56:23,016
-Somebody already sent for it.
-Yeah, we can't get that.

1130
01:56:23,184 --> 01:56:26,353
How about this?
"Tired of getting sand kicked in your face?"

1131
01:56:30,066 --> 01:56:33,193
-Where's Billy?
-He'll be down in a minute. I know he's up.

1132
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:35,570
Billy?

1133
01:56:35,738 --> 01:56:37,197
Stan, are you all right?

1134
01:56:39,409 --> 01:56:41,743
I didn't get much sleep last night.

1135
01:56:41,911 --> 01:56:43,745
The storm?

1136
01:56:44,205 --> 01:56:47,249
No, it's this goddamn stiff neck.
I can barely move my head.

1137
01:56:47,709 --> 01:56:49,167
Well, you must have strained it.

1138
01:56:49,335 --> 01:56:53,046
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. I don't know.

1139
01:56:53,923 --> 01:56:56,508
Well, you poor old bear.
You want me to get some Bengay?

1140
01:56:56,676 --> 01:56:58,927
No. No.

1141
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:06,101
I'll teach him
to throw away my comic books.

1142
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:13,608
Ready for another shot, Dad?
