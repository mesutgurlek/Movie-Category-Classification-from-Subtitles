NARRATOR: This is a story
of an ordinary little boy...

2
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,136
...named Charlie Bucket.

3
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:28,350
He was not faster or stronger
or more clever than other children.

4
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:35,107
His family was not rich
or powerful or well-connected.

5
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,069
In fact, they barely had enough to eat.

6
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,533
Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy
in the entire world.

7
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,077
He just didn't know it yet.

8
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,679
- Evening, Buckets.
- Evening.

00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,306
CHARLIE:
Hi, Dad.

10
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,643
Soup's almost ready, darling.

11
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,480
Don't suppose there's anything
extra to put in, love.

12
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,942
Oh, well. Nothing goes better
with cabbage than cabbage.

13
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,948
Charlie...

14
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,868
...I found something I think you'll like.

15
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,375
NARRATOR: Charlie's father worked
at the local toothpaste factory.

16
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,588
The hours were long,
and the pay was terrible...

17
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:44,593
...yet occasionally,
there were unexpected surprises.

18
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,597
It's exactly what I need.

19
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,224
What is it, Charlie?

20
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,775
Dad found it, just the piece I needed.

21
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,944
- What piece was it?
- A head for Willy Wonka.

22
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,363
Well, how wonderful.

23
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,573
It's quite a likeness.

24
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,408
CHARLIE: You think so?
- Think so?

25
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,160
I know so.

26
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,997
I saw Willy Wonka
with my own two eyes.

27
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,458
- I used to work for him, you know.
- You did?

28
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,168
- I did.
- He did.

29
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,628
He did.

30
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,797
I love grapes.

31
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:26,343
Of course, I was a much
younger man in those days.

32
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:32,391
GRANDPA JOE: Willy Wonka began with
a single store on Cherry Street.

33
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,852
But the whole world wanted his candy.

34
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,566
- Mr. Wonka.
- Yeah?

35
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,527
We need more Wonka bars...

36
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:47,531
...and we're out of chocolate birds.
- Birds?

37
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,157
Birds.

38
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:53,370
Well, then we'll need
to make some more. Here.

39
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,707
Now open.

[TITTERS]

42
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,964
The man was a genius.

43
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,802
Did you know he invented a new way
of making chocolate ice cream...

44
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,639
...so that it stays cold for hours
without a freezer?

45
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,310
You can even leave it lying in the sun
on a hot day, and it won't go runny.

46
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:21,356
- But that's impossible.
- But Willy Wonka did it.

47
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,735
GRANDPA JOE:
Before long...

48
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:29,448
...he decided to build
a proper chocolate factory.

49
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,701
The largest chocolate factory
in history.

50
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,163
Fifty times as big as any other.

51
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,850
Grandpa, don't make it gross.

52
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,730
Tell him about the Indian prince.
He'd like to hear about that.

53
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,566
You mean, Prince Pondicherry?

54
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:09,529
Well, Prince Pondicherry
wrote a letter to Mr. Wonka...

55
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,407
...and asked him to come
all the way out to India...

56
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:17,204
...and build him a colossal palace
entirely out of chocolate.

57
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,539
[LAUGHS]

58
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,875
WONKA:
It will have 100 rooms...

59
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:26,671
...and everything will be made
of dark or light chocolate.

60
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,136
GRANDPA JOE: True to his word,
the bricks were chocolate...

61
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,056
...and the cement holding
them together was chocolate.

62
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,101
All the walls and ceilings
were made of chocolate as well.

63
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,856
So were the carpets
and the pictures and the furniture.

64
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,943
It is perfect in every way.

65
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,238
Yeah, but it won't last long.
You better start eating right now.

66
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:55,200
Oh, nonsense. I will not eat my palace.

67
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,703
I intend to live in it.

68
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,959
But Mr. Wonka was right, of course.

69
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:09,798
Soon after this, there came
a very hot day with a boiling sun.

70
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,051
Mmm.

71
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,685
[LAUGHS]

72
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:50,714
The prince sent an urgent telegram
requesting a new palace...

73
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,675
...but Willy Wonka was facing
problems of his own.

74
00:09:55,678 --> 00:10:00,557
All the other chocolate makers, you see,
had grown jealous of Mr. Wonka.

75
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:05,520
They began sending in spies
to steal his secret recipes.

76
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:37,385
Fickelgruber started making
an ice cream that would never melt.

77
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,931
Prodnose came out with a chewing gum
that never lost its flavor.

78
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,893
Then Slugworth
began making candy balloons...

79
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,063
...that you could blow up
to incredible sizes.

80
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,191
The thievery got so bad...

81
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,526
...that one day, without warning...

82
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:58,239
...Mr. Wonka told every single one
of his workers to go home.

83
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:03,244
He announced that he was closing
his chocolate factory forever.

84
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:07,624
I'm closing my chocolate factory
forever.

85
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,084
I'm sorry.

86
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,812
But it didn't close forever.
It's open right now.

87
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:33,233
Ah, yes, sometimes when grownups say
"forever," they mean "a very long time."

88
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,112
Such as, "I feel like I've eaten
nothing but cabbage soup forever."

89
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,949
- Now, Pops.
- The factory did close, Charlie.

90
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,120
And it seemed like it was
going to be closed forever.

91
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,958
Then one day we saw smoke
rising from the chimneys.

92
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:54,003
- The factory was back in business.
- Did you get your job back?

93
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,297
No.

94
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,299
No one did.

95
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,596
But there must be
people working there.

96
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,308
Think about it, Charlie.
Have you ever seen a single person...

97
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,145
...going into that factory
or coming out of it?

98
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,524
No. The gates are always closed.

99
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,359
Exactly.

100
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,028
But then, who's running the machines?

101
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,157
- Nobody knows, Charlie.
- It certainly is a mystery.

102
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,659
Hasn't someone asked Mr. Wonka?

103
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,372
Nobody sees him anymore.
He never comes out.

104
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:34,461
The only thing that comes
out of that place is the candy...

105
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,172
...already packed and addressed.

106
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:42,761
I'd give anything in the world
just to go in one more time...

107
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:47,015
...and see what's become
of that amazing factory.

108
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,561
Well, you won't, because you can't.
No one can.

109
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,690
It's a mystery,
and it will always be a mystery.

110
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,653
That little factory of yours, Charlie, is as
close as any of us is ever going to get.

we let your grandparents get some sleep.

Eat it. Go on.

So imagine, you're sitting at home
watching television...

949
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:21,003
...and suddenly a commercial will flash
onto the screen, and a voice will say:

950
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:25,257
"Wonka's chocolates
are the best in the world.

If you don't believe us,
try one for yourself."

Say, like, breakfast cereal?

956
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:42,149
Do you have any idea
what breakfast cereal's made of?

957
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:45,652
It's those little curly wooden shavings
you find in pencil sharpeners.

958
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,946
But could you send it by TV
if you wanted to?

959
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,240
- Of course I could.
- What about people?

960
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:54,119
Well, why would I wanna send a person?
They don't taste very good at all.

961

Don't you realize what you've invented?
It's a teleporter.

01:38:48,839 --> 01:38:51,674
...and the one who was the least rotten
would be the winner.

1098
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:53,468
That's you, Charlie.

1099
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:55,386
So, what do you say?

1100
01:38:55,554 --> 01:38:59,223
Are you ready to leave all this behind
and come live with me at the factory?

1101
01:38:59,391 --> 01:39:00,642
Sure. Of course.

1102
01:39:00,809 --> 01:39:03,478
I mean, it's all right
if my family come too?

1103
01:39:03,687 --> 01:39:05,939
Oh, my dear boy, of course they can't.

1104
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:08,483
You can't run a chocolate factory...

1105
01:39:08,692 --> 01:39:11,986
...with a family hanging over you
like an old, dead goose. No offense.

1106
01:39:12,196 --> 01:39:13,988
None taken, jerk.

1107
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:18,576
A chocolatier has to run free and solo.

1108
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:21,704
He has to follow his dreams.
Gosh darn the consequences.

1109
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:24,457
Look at me.

1110
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:27,210
I had no family,
and I'm a giant success.

1111
01:39:28,504 --> 01:39:32,507
So if I go with you to the factory,
I won't ever see my family again?

1112
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:35,051
Yeah. Consider that a bonus.

1113
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:38,888
Then I'm not going.

1114
01:39:40,015 --> 01:39:42,225
I wouldn't give up my family
for anything.

1115
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,978
Not for all the chocolate in the world.

1116
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:49,649
Oh, I see.

1117
01:39:51,527 --> 01:39:53,444
That's weird.

1118
01:39:56,573 --> 01:39:59,242
There's other candy too
besides chocolate.

1119
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:03,079
I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka.
I'm staying here.

1120
01:40:05,874 --> 01:40:07,583
Wow.

1121
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,754
Well, that's just...

1122
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:14,465
...unexpected...

1123
01:40:16,051 --> 01:40:17,677
...and weird.

1124
01:40:24,768 --> 01:40:27,437
But I suppose, in that case, I'll just...

1125
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:31,149
Goodbye, then.

1126
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:35,778
Sure you won't change your mind?

1127
01:40:38,407 --> 01:40:39,949
I'm sure.

1128
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:51,294
Okay. Bye.

1129
01:41:12,941 --> 01:41:15,693
Things are going to get much better.

1130
01:41:16,612 --> 01:41:19,363
NARRATOR:
And for once, Grandma Georgina...

1131
01:41:19,531 --> 01:41:22,325
...knew exactly what
she was talking about.

1132
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:27,455
The next morning, Charlie helped
his parents fix the hole in the roof.

1133
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:31,959
Grandpa Joe spent the whole day
out of bed.

1134
01:41:32,127 --> 01:41:33,961
He didn't feel tired at all.

1135
01:41:35,839 --> 01:41:39,342
Charlie's father got a better job
at the toothpaste factory...

1136
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:43,054
...repairing the machine
that had replaced him.

1137
01:41:44,848 --> 01:41:48,184
Things had never been better
for the Bucket family.

1138
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:52,105
The same could not be said
for Willy Wonka.

1139
01:41:52,272 --> 01:41:54,482
I can't put my finger on it.

1140
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:57,193
Candy's the only thing
I was ever certain of...

1141
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:59,821
...and now I'm just not
certain at all.

1142
01:41:59,988 --> 01:42:02,782
I don't know which flavors to make
or which ideas to try.

1143
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,618
I'm second-guessing myself,
which is nuts.

1144
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:10,164
I've always made whatever candy
I felt like, and I...

1145
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:18,422
That's just it, isn't it?

1146
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:23,136
I make the candy I feel like, but now
I feel terrible, so the candy's terrible.

1147
01:42:24,304 --> 01:42:26,889
You're very good.

1148
01:42:38,902 --> 01:42:40,820
MAN: Pity about that chocolate fellow,
Wendell... Walter.

1149
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:44,574
- Willy Wonka.
- That's the one.

1150
01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:48,327
Says here in the paper his new candies
aren't selling very well.

1151
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:52,540
But I suppose maybe he's just
a rotten egg who deserves it.

1152
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:55,585
- Yep.
- Oh, really?

1153
01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:58,045
You ever met him?

1154
01:42:58,213 --> 01:42:59,839
I did.

1155
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:04,719
I thought he was great at first,
but then he didn't turn out so nice.

1156
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:07,346
He also has a funny haircut.

1157
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:08,848
I do not!

1158
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,727
- Why are you here?
- I don't feel so hot.

1159
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:15,563
What makes you feel better
when you feel terrible?

1160
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:17,356
My family.

1161
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:18,858
Ew.

1162
01:43:21,111 --> 01:43:22,945
What do you have against my family?

1163
01:43:23,697 --> 01:43:27,074
It's not just your family.
It's the whole idea of...

1164
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,413
They tell you what to do,
what not to do...

1165
01:43:32,581 --> 01:43:35,041
...and it's not conducive
to a creative atmosphere.

1166
01:43:35,626 --> 01:43:39,462
Usually they're just trying to protect you
because they love you.

1167
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:44,008
If you don't believe me,
you should ask.

1168
01:43:44,176 --> 01:43:47,136
Ask who? My father?

1169
01:43:47,554 --> 01:43:49,222
No way.

1170
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:51,474
At least, not by myself.

1171
01:43:52,976 --> 01:43:54,268
You want me to go with you?

1172
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:00,775
Hey. Hey, what a good idea. Yeah!

1173
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:05,821
And you know what?
I've got transport...

1174
01:44:09,701 --> 01:44:12,995
I have to be more careful
where I park this thing.

1175
01:44:43,318 --> 01:44:45,861
I think we've got the wrong house.

1176
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:50,908
[BUZZER RINGS]

1177
01:45:00,419 --> 01:45:01,877
Do you have an appointment?

1178
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:04,547
No. But he's overdue.

1179
01:45:07,843 --> 01:45:09,844
Open.

1180
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:15,766
Now, let's see what the damage is,
shall we?

1181
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,850
Heavens.

1182
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:01,187
I haven't seen bicuspids
like these since...

1183
01:46:05,233 --> 01:46:07,109
Since...

1184
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:17,620
Willy?

1185
01:46:19,456 --> 01:46:20,915
Hi, Dad.

1186
01:46:31,927 --> 01:46:34,178
All these years...

1187
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:37,056
...and you haven't flossed.

1188
01:46:39,142 --> 01:46:40,976
Not once.

1189
01:47:06,169 --> 01:47:07,586
NARRATOR:
It was on this day...

1190
01:47:07,796 --> 01:47:10,297
...that Willy Wonka
repeated his offer to Charlie...

1191
01:47:10,465 --> 01:47:13,217
...who accepted on one condition.

1192
01:47:13,385 --> 01:47:15,678
Sorry we're late.
We were brainstorming.

1193
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:17,805
Thought I heard thunder.

1194
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:21,600
- You staying for dinner, Willy?
- Yes, please.

1195
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:24,186
I'll shuffle the plates.

1196
01:47:32,737 --> 01:47:36,031
You smell like peanuts.

1197
01:47:36,408 --> 01:47:39,785
- I love peanuts.
- Oh, thank you.

1198
01:47:39,953 --> 01:47:41,620
You smell like...

1199
01:47:41,788 --> 01:47:43,622
...old people and soap.

1200
01:47:46,501 --> 01:47:48,210
I like it.

1201
01:47:52,799 --> 01:47:55,301
Elbows off the table, Charlie.

1202
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:57,845
How do you feel about
little raspberry kites?

1203
01:47:58,013 --> 01:47:59,555
With licorice instead of string.

1204
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:04,143
- Boys, no business at the dinner table.
- Sorry, Mom.

1205
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:07,730
I think you're on to something,
though, Charlie.

1206
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:23,871
NARRATOR: In the end Charlie Bucket
won a chocolate factory.

1207
01:48:25,248 --> 01:48:29,919
But Willy Wonka got something
even better:

1208
01:48:30,545 --> 01:48:33,047
A family.

1209
01:48:34,382 --> 01:48:38,552
And one thing was absolutely certain:

1210
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:42,973
Life had never been sweeter.
