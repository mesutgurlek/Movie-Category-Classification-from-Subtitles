00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,601
- I think you finished.
- Oh, right.

304
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,502
Furthermore, it is
the birthright of every man...

305
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,598
- Or woman.
- Why don't you shut up about women?

306
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,838
Women have a perfect right
to play a part in our movement.

307
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:42,210
Why are you always on
about women, Stan?

308
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,873
I want to be one.

309
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:49,112
- What?
- I want to be a woman.

310
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,147
From now on, I want you all
to call me "Loretta. "

311
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,460
- What?
- It's my right as a man.

312
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,192
Well, why do you want
to be Loretta, Stan?

313
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,860
I want to have babies.

314
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,530
You want to have babies?

315
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,301
It's every man's right
to have babies if he wants them.

316
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,172
- But you can't have babies.
- Don't you oppress me.

317
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,702
I'm not oppressing you.
You haven't got a womb.

318
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,806
Where is the fetus
gonna gestate?

319
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,317
You're gonna keep it
in a box?

Here, I've got an idea.

322
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,086
Suppose you agree that
he can't actually have babies,

323
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,391
not having a womb... which is
nobody's fault, not even the Romans'...

324
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,398
but that he can have
the right to have babies?

325
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,264
Good idea, Judith.
We shall fight the oppressors...

326
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,463
for your right to have
babies, brother...

327
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,302
- Sister. Sorry.
- What's the point?

328
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,605
- What?
- What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies...

329
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:49,010
when he can't have babies?

330
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,608
It is symbolic of our
struggle against oppression.

331
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,215
Symbolic of his struggle
against reality.

"Romanes eunt domus"?

00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,883
"People called Romanes,
they go the house"?

382
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,120
I- It says "Romans, go home. "

383
00:24:56,194 --> 00:25:00,290
No, it doesn't.
What's Latin for "Roman"?

- Come on!
- "Romanes"?

- Goes like?
- "Annus"?

386
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,833
- Vocative plural of "annus" is?
- "Anni"?

"Romani. "

388
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,368
- "Eunt"? What is "eunt"?
- "Go. "

389
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,537
Conjugate the verb "to go. "

390

"Ire, eo, is, it,
imus, itis, eunt. "

00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,074
So "eunt" is?

392
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:22,813
Third person plural,
present indicative. "They go. "

393
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:27,587
But "Romans, go home" is
an order, so you must use the...

- Which is?

- How many Romans?
- Aah! Plural, plural.

00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,533
- "Ite. "
- "Ite. "

"Go home. " This is motion

and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.

Having grabbed his wife, we inform
Pilate that she is in our custody...

00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:57,238
and forthwith issue our demands.

- Any questions?
- What exactly are the demands?

We're giving Pilate
two days to dismantle...

the entire apparatus of
the Roman Imperialist State,

424
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,414
and if he doesn't agree
immediately, we execute her.

425
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:10,454
- Cut her head off?
- Cut all her bits off.

426
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,491
Send them back
on the hour, every hour.

427
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,288
And, of course, we point out
that they bear...

full responsibility
when we chop her up...

to blackmail.

- Don't labor the point.

And what have they ever
given us in return?

436
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,347
- The aqueduct.
- What?

437

The aqueduct.

438
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,720
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They did give us that.

439
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,229
And the sanitation.

440
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:56,825
Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg.
Remember what the city used to be like.

441
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,667
Yeah, I'll grant you, the aqueduct and
sanitation are two things the Romans have done.

442
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,674

I mean, the roads go
without saying, don't they?

But apart from the sanitation,
the aqueduct and the roads...

- Medicine.

- Education.
- Yeah, all right. Fair enough.

- And the wine.

Yeah, that's something we'd really miss,
Reg, if the Romans left.

449
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:24,058
- Public baths.
- And it's safe to walk in the streets at night.

Yeah, they certainly keep order. They're

Oh, Reg. Reg, Judith.

We... We need doers
in our movement, Brian,

but before you join us, know this:

00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,598
There is not one of us who
would not gladly suffer death...

472
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,108
to rid this country of
the Romans once and for all.

- [Man] Uh, well, one.
- Oh, yeah, there's one.

But otherwise, we're solid.
Are you with us?

Yes.

From now on you shall be called
"Brian that is called Brian. "

on Pilate's palace, Francis.

478

Right.
This is the plan.

479
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,190
Now, this is the palace
on Caesar's Square.

480
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:10,098
Our commando unit will approach
from Fish Street under cover of night...

481
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:13,729
and make our way
to the northwestern main drain.

482
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:17,798
If questioned, we are sewage workers
on our way to a conference.

Reg, our glorious leader
and founder of the P.F. J.,

will be coordinating consultant
at the drain head,

485
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,313
though he himself will not be taking
part in any terrorist action...

486
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,320

- Solidarity, brother.

Oh, yes, solidarity, Reg.

489
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,623
[Francis] Once in the sewer,
timing will be of the essence.

490
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,893
There is a Roman feast later
in the evening, so you must move fast.

And don't wear
your best sandals.

492

Turning left here, we enter the
Caesar-Augustus memorial sewer,

493
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:51,503
and from there proceed
directly to the hypocaust.

494
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:56,445
This has just been retiled. So,
terrorists, careful with those weapons.

495
00:31:56,514 --> 00:32:00,211
We will now be directly beneath
Pilate's audience chamber itself.

We're gonna kidnap Pilate's wife,
take her back, issue demands.

- So are we. That's our plan.
- What?

- We were here first.
- What do you mean?

- We did!

Yes, a couple of years ago.
We did!

worked out, then?

- Of course we have.
- What are they?

- Well, I'm not telling you.
- Oh, come on!

That's not the point.
We thought of it before you.

- We did!

Every night, they take me down for
20 minutes, then they hang me up again,

which I regard as very fair
in view of what I've done.

And if nothing else, it's
taught me to respect the Romans,

562
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:52,302
and it's taught me that you'll
never get anywhere in this life...

01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,864
We've got
a luncheon appointment.

1061
01:08:56,933 --> 01:08:58,924
The lepers are queuing.

1062
01:08:59,002 --> 01:09:01,869
My brother-on-law
is the ex-mayor of Gath!

1063
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:06,102
Brian, can I introduce the gentleman
who's letting us have the Mounts on Sunday?

1064
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:11,306
- Don't push!
- And keep the noise down!

1065
01:09:11,381 --> 01:09:16,512
Those possessed by devils,
try and keep them under control.

1066
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:19,419
Incurables, you'll just
have to wait for a few minutes.

1067
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:24,085
Um, women taken in sin, line up
against that wall, will you?

1068
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,961
Brian? Brian,
you were fantastic.

1069
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:31,159
You weren't so bad yourself.

1070
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:34,226
No. What you said just now.
It was quite extraordinary.

1071
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:36,237
What?
All that, was it?

1072
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:38,432
We don't any leaders.
You're so right.

1073
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:41,272
- Reg has been dominating us for too long.
- Well, yes.

1074
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:45,144
- It needed saying, and you said it, Brian.
- You're very attractive.

1075
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:48,479
It's our revolution.
We can all do it together.

1076
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:51,384
- I think. I think...
- We're all behind you, Brian.

1077
01:09:51,454 --> 01:09:54,548
- The revolution is in your hands!
- What?

1078
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:56,888
No, that's not
what I meant at all!

1079
01:09:56,959 --> 01:10:00,292
You're fuckin' nicked,
me old beauty.

1080
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,297
Right.

1081
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,369
Stop it.

[Grunts]

1083
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:15,942
Well, "Bwian," you've given us
a good "wun" for our money, what?

you will not escape.

"cwucifixions" today?

1087
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:30,551
139, sir. Special celebration.
Passover, sir.

1088
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:34,926
Right. Now we have 140.
Nice, round number, eh, Biggus?

1089
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:38,763
- [Chuckles]
- Hail Caesar!

1090
01:10:38,835 --> 01:10:41,827
- Hail.
- The crowd outside getting restless.

1091
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,929
Permission
to disperse them, please.

1092
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:47,498
Disperse them?
I haven't addressed them yet.

1093
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:49,169
I know, sir, but...

1094
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,679
My "addwess" is one of
the high points of the Passover.

1095
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:53,978
My "fwiend" Biggus Dickus has
come all the way from "Wome. "

1096
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,486
- Hail Caesar.
- Hail "Thaesar,"

1097
01:10:57,553 --> 01:11:00,386
You're not...

1098
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:04,153
Are you not thinking of giving it
a miss this year, then, sir?

1099
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:06,286
Give it a miss?

1100
01:11:06,362 --> 01:11:09,763
Well, it's just that they're in
a rather funny mood today, sir.

1101
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:12,858
"Weally," "centuwion," I'm "surpwised"
to hear a man like you...

1102
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,335
"wattled" by
a "wabble" of "wowdy" "webels. "

1103
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:18,498
- Uh, a bit thundery, sir.
- Take him away.

1104
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:21,407
I'm a Roman!
I- I can prove it! Honestly!

1105
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:24,810
And "cwucify" him well.
Yes.

1106
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:27,441
Biggus.

1107
01:11:27,517 --> 01:11:30,247
- I-I really wouldn't, sir.
- Out of the way, "centuwion. "

1108
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,583
Let me come with you,
Pontius.

1109
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:36,819
I may be of "thome" "athistance"
if there is a "thudden" "crithis. "

1110
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:41,262
Right. Now item four: Attainment of world
supremacy within the next five years.

1111
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:44,527
- Uh, Francis, you've been doing some work on this?
- Yeah. Thank you, Reg.

1112
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,036
Well, quite frankly, siblings,
I think five years is optimistic...

1113
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:51,073
unless we can smash the Roman Empire
within the next 12 months.

1114
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,074
- Twelve months, yeah?
- Twelve months.

1115
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:56,600
And let's face it, as empires
go, this is the big one,

1116
01:11:56,679 --> 01:12:00,945
so we gotta get up off our asses
and stop just talkin' about it.

1117
01:12:01,017 --> 01:12:03,918
- Hear! Hear!
- It's action that counts, not words.

1118
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,352
- And we need action now!
- Hear! Hear!

1119
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,447
You're right. We could
sit around here all day,

1120
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:11,960
talkin', passin' resolutions,
makin' clever speeches.

1121
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:14,360
It's not gonna shift
one Roman soldier!

1122
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:17,866
So let's just stop gabbin' on about it.
It's completely pointless.

1123
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:19,902
- And it's gettin' us nowhere.
- Right!

1124
01:12:19,969 --> 01:12:22,437
I agree. This is a complete
waste of time.

1125
01:12:23,873 --> 01:12:26,307
- They've arrested Brian!
- What? What?

1126
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:29,037
They dragged him off!
They want to crucify him!

1127
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:32,638
Right! This calls
for immediate discussion!

1128
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:34,273
- What?
- Immediate!

1129
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,783
- Right.
- New motion?

1130
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:38,184
Completely new motion.
Uh, that, uh,

1131
01:12:38,254 --> 01:12:40,950
that there be
immediate action...

1132
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,651
- Once the vote has been taken.
- Obviously once the vote's been taken.

1133
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:47,856
- You can't act on a resolution till you've voted on it.
- Reg, let's go now, please!

1134
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:52,958
- Right! In the light of fresh information from Sibling Judith.
- Not so fast, Reg.

1135
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:56,903
Reg, for God's sake!
It's perfectly simple.

1136
01:12:56,973 --> 01:13:00,033
All you've got to do
is to go out of that door now...

1137
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,669
and try to stop the Romans
nailing him up!

Something's actually happening, Reg!

from the feminists?

- What?
- Oh, sorry, Loretta?

would you?

Uh, freedom for me.
They said I hadn't done anything,

1154

01:16:57,513 --> 01:16:59,538
Next.

1205
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,981
- Crucifixion?
- Yes.

1206
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:05,817
Good. Out of the door,
line on the left, one cross each.

1207
01:17:05,888 --> 01:17:08,288
- Jailer...
- Excuse me. There's been some sort of mistake.

1208
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:12,054
Just a moment, would you?
Jailer, how many have come through?

1209
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:14,221
What?

1210
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:17,322
Uh, how many
have come through?

1211
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:19,867
- What?
- Y-Y-Y-You'll have to...

1212
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:25,339
spe-sp-spe-sp-sp-sp-speak up
a bit, sir.

He's deaf as a p-p-post, sir.

01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:32,780
Oh, yes.

1216
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:36,750
Uh, how many
have come through?

[Laughing]

1218
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:42,519
- Oh, dear.

ninety-f... ninety-f...

ninety-six, sir.

1221
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,697
It's such a senseless waste
of human life, isn't it?

1222
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:53,735
N- N-N-No, sir.

C- Crucifixion's
too good 'em, sir.

1227
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,276
I don't think you can say it's
too good for them. It's very nasty.

1228
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:13,879
Oh, it's not as n-n-na-na...

1229
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:17,221
not as nasty as something
I just thought up, sir.

1230
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:21,229
- Yeah. Now, crucifixion?
- Is there someone I can speak to?

1231
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:24,824
- Well...
- I know where to get it, if you want it.

1232
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,425
- What?
- D-Don't worry about hi-him, sir.

H- He's de... He's de...
He's de-de-de...

1234

- He's deaf and mad, sir.
- Well, how did he get the job?

1235
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:39,208
- B-Bloody Pilate's pet, sir.
- [Chuckles]

1236

Get a move on, Big Nose. There's people
waitin' to be crucified out here.

1237
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,879
- [Laughing]
- Could I see a lawyer or someone?

1238
01:18:44,954 --> 01:18:47,821
- Um, do, do you have a lawyer?
- No, but I'm a Roman.

1239
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:50,757
How about a retrial?
We got plenty of time.

1240
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:53,886
- Shut up, you!
- Miserable Romans. No sense of humor.

- [Grunts]
- I'm sorry. Bit of a hurry.

Crucifixion party.

1252
01:19:37,573 --> 01:19:41,737
Morning. Now, we will be on
a show as we go through the town,

1253
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,778
so let's not
let the side down.

1254
01:19:43,846 --> 01:19:46,906
Keep in a straight line, three lengths
between you and the man in front...

1255
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:49,246
and a good, steady pace.

1256
01:19:49,318 --> 01:19:51,548
Crosses over
your left shoulders,

1257
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:54,214
and if you keep your backs
hard up against the cross beam,

1258
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:56,224
- you'll be there in no time.

All right, centurion.

Crucifixion party...
Wait for it!

1261

your burden, brother.

Oh, thank you.

- Hey, what do you think you're doing?

I'm gonna give you
one more chance.

01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:56,909
This time I want to hear
no "Weubens,"

no "Weginalds,"

- What?

Uh, you just sent him
for crucifixion, sir.

Wait, wait.
We do have a "Bwian. "

- Or you'll be in trouble.
- Oh, dear.

1289

You mean I might have to give up
being crucified in the afternoons?

- Shut up!
- That would be a blow, wouldn't it?

Um, it's not my cross.
I was, um, holding it for someone.

Just lie down.
I haven't got all day.

No, of course. Look.

We don't want any more
Samaritans around here.

01:24:24,293 --> 01:24:26,887
Yeah, yeah,
we'll let you down. Next!

You don't have to do this.
You don't have to take orders.

are you?

It's a bit late for that now,
isn't it?

Oh, now, now. We've got
a couple of days up here.

Plenty of time.
Lots of people get rescued.

- Yeah. My brother usually rescues me,

if he can keep off the tail
for more than 20 minutes.

- Thank God you've come, Reg.

01:25:28,557 --> 01:25:33,153
Well, I think I should point out first, Brian,
in all fairness, we are not the rescue committee.

1351
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:36,095
However, I have been asked to read
the following prepared statement...

the occasion of your martyrdom. "

1356
01:25:49,044 --> 01:25:51,911
- What?
- "Your death will stand as a landmark...

on a personal note, my own admiration...

for you a very difficult time.

- Reg, w-what are you going to...
- Good-bye, Brian, and thanks.
