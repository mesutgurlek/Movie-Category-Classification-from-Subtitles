These four stinkin' walls,

The find of the evening

was the author of this drama
about simple folk,

cannot quite quell their longing
for something higher.

00:21:55,144 --> 00:21:57,237
Somebody just complained.

336
00:21:57,313 --> 00:21:58,644
No. I didn't.

337
00:21:58,714 --> 00:22:01,148
I mean, I did call down,

338
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,410
not to complain exactly.

339
00:22:02,484 --> 00:22:04,577
I was concerned that you might...

340
00:22:04,653 --> 00:22:06,450
not that it's my business...

341
00:22:06,522 --> 00:22:08,922
might be in some kind of... distress.

342
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:12,256
See, I was trying to work,
and it's...

343
00:22:12,328 --> 00:22:14,523
Well, it was... difficult.

344
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:20,294
Yeah.

345
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:22,963
I'm damned sorry
if I bothered you.

346
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:24,471
The damn walls here...

347
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,474
I just apologize like hell.

348
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:27,975
My name's Charlie Meadows.

349
00:22:28,043 --> 00:22:29,840
I guess we're neighbors.

350
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:30,970
Barton Fink.

351
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:32,479
Neighbor, I'd feel better

352
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:33,981
about the damned inconvenience

353
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:36,574
if you let me buy you a drink.

354
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,112
That's all right.
Really.

355
00:22:40,189 --> 00:22:41,622
Thank you.

356
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,089
All right, hell.

357
00:22:43,158 --> 00:22:44,591
You trying to work,

358
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,525
me carrying on in there.

359
00:22:46,595 --> 00:22:48,324
The liquor's good.
What do you say?

360
00:22:48,397 --> 00:22:49,796
You got a glass?

361
00:22:49,865 --> 00:22:52,663
It's the least I can do.

362
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:55,135
Okay, a quick one.

363
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:57,104
Sure.

364
00:22:57,172 --> 00:22:59,003
Yeah, just a nip.

365
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:02,609
I sure do forget myself sometimes.

366
00:23:02,678 --> 00:23:05,579
I feel like a heel...

367
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:07,550
All the carryings-on next door.

368
00:23:07,683 --> 00:23:09,412
That's okay, I assure you.

369
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:12,318
It's just I was trying to work.

370
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:16,290
What kind of work do you do, Barton,
if you don't mind my asking?

371
00:23:16,358 --> 00:23:18,189
Well, I'm a writer, actually.

372
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,785
You don't say?
That's a tough racket.

373
00:23:20,863 --> 00:23:22,694
My hat's off to you.

374
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:24,858
Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.

375
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:26,561
It's not easy, but...

376
00:23:26,635 --> 00:23:28,603
Damn difficult, I'd imagine.

377
00:23:28,671 --> 00:23:31,105
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?

378
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:32,765
Hell, no, call me Charlie.

379
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:34,001
Well, Barton...

380
00:23:34,076 --> 00:23:37,011
you might say I sell peace of mind.

381
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,842
Insurance is my game.
Door-to-door.

382
00:23:38,914 --> 00:23:42,281
Human contact's the only way
to move merchandise.

383
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:45,149
In spite of what you might think,
I'm pretty good at it.

384
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,710
It doesn't surprise me.

385
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:48,120
I believe in it.

386
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,385
Fire, theft, and casualty aren't things

387
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:52,689
that only happen to other people.

388
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:54,228
Writing doesn't work out,

389
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:56,696
you may want to look into it.

390
00:23:56,765 --> 00:23:59,097
Providing basic needs...
you could do worse.

391
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:01,159
I'll keep that in mind.

392
00:24:01,236 --> 00:24:03,500
What kind of scribbler are you?

393
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:05,437
Newspaperman did you say?

394
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:08,340
No. Actually, I'm writing
for the pictures now.

395
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,672
Pictures?

396
00:24:09,745 --> 00:24:11,212
Jesus!

397
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:15,282
Aw, I'm sorry, brother.

398
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:17,615
I was just sitting here thinking

399
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:21,144
I was talking to some ambitious
youngster eager to make good.

400
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:23,088
Hell, you've got it made.

401
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:25,217
Beating out that competition?

402
00:24:25,294 --> 00:24:27,819
And me being patronizing?

403
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:32,029
Is the egg showing or what?

404
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:34,865
Actually, I'm just starting out
in the movies,

405
00:24:34,937 --> 00:24:37,872
though I was well established
in New York,

406
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,635
some renown there.

407
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:42,108
Oh, it's an exciting time, then.

408
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:44,737
I'm not the best-read mug on the planet,

409
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:48,112
so it's not surprising
I didn't recognize your name.

410
00:24:48,183 --> 00:24:50,617
Jesus, I feel like a heel.

411
00:24:50,686 --> 00:24:53,519
That's okay, Charlie.
I'm a playwright.

412
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:55,955
My shows have only played New York.

413
00:24:56,025 --> 00:24:58,459
The last one got
a hell of a write-up.

414
00:24:58,527 --> 00:25:00,495
Must be why they wanted me.

415
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:02,427
Why not?
Everyone wants quality.

416
00:25:02,498 --> 00:25:06,901
What kind of venue...
that is to say,

417
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:08,402
thematically,

418
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,267
um...

419
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:12,204
What do I write about?

420
00:25:13,676 --> 00:25:16,110
Caught me trying to be fancy.

421
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:17,645
Yeah, that's it, Bart.

422
00:25:17,713 --> 00:25:19,578
Well, that's a good question.

423
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:22,082
Strange as it may seem, Charlie,

424
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:24,642
I write about people like you...

425
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,915
the working stiff,
the common man.

426
00:25:26,989 --> 00:25:29,287
Well, ain't that
a kick in the head.

427
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:32,122
I guess it is, but in a way,

428
00:25:32,194 --> 00:25:33,593
that's exactly the point.

429
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:36,256
There's a few people in New York...

430
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:38,026
hopefully our numbers are growing...

431
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,295
who feel we have an opportunity

432
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:43,805
to forge something real
out of everyday experience,

433
00:25:43,872 --> 00:25:46,306
create a theater for the masses

434
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,639
based on a few simple truths,

435
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:51,305
not on some shopworn abstractions
about drama

436
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,780
that don't hold true today.

437
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:56,545
I don't guess this means much to you.

438
00:25:56,618 --> 00:25:58,882
Hell, I could tell you stories.

439
00:25:58,954 --> 00:26:01,787
And that's the point...
we all have stories.

440
00:26:01,857 --> 00:26:05,258
The hopes and dreams
of the common man

441
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:08,057
are as noble as those of any king.

442
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,563
The stuff of life...

443
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:12,225
Why shouldn't it be
the stuff of theater?

444
00:26:12,301 --> 00:26:15,236
Why should that be
such a hard pill to swallow?

445
00:26:15,304 --> 00:26:17,568
Don't call it new theater, Charlie.

446
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:19,072
Call it real theater.

447
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:21,006
Call it <i>our</i> theater!

448
00:26:21,076 --> 00:26:24,477
I can see you feel
pretty strongly about it.

449
00:26:24,546 --> 00:26:27,481
I don't mean to get up
on my high horse,

450
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:30,484
but why shouldn't we
look at ourselves up there?

451
00:26:30,552 --> 00:26:33,077
Who cares about
the fifth Earl of Bastrop

452
00:26:33,155 --> 00:26:34,622
and Lady Higginbottom

453
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,089
and...

454
00:26:36,158 --> 00:26:38,683
and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?

455
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:40,695
My butt's getting sore already.

456
00:26:40,763 --> 00:26:43,095
Exactly.
You understand what I'm saying

457
00:26:43,165 --> 00:26:45,759
a lot more than some
of these literary types

458
00:26:45,834 --> 00:26:47,426
because you're a real man.

459
00:26:47,503 --> 00:26:50,267
I could tell you some stories...

460
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:51,738
Sure, you could,

461
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:54,605
yet many writers insulate themselves
from the common man,

462
00:26:54,676 --> 00:26:56,735
from where they live,

463
00:26:56,812 --> 00:26:59,144
from where they trade
and fight and love

464
00:26:59,214 --> 00:27:00,647
and converse and...

465
00:27:00,716 --> 00:27:02,115
and...

466
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,486
So, naturally, their work suffers

467
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:07,954
and regresses into
empty formalism and...

468
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:09,957
Well, I'm spouting off again,

469
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:12,550
but to put it in your language...

470
00:27:12,628 --> 00:27:14,926
the theater becomes
as phony as a $3 bill.

471
00:27:14,997 --> 00:27:17,090
That's a tragedy right there.

472
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:20,795
You're all right, Charlie.

473
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:23,531
I'm glad you stopped by.

474
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:25,470
I know sometimes I run on.

475
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:28,772
Well, Christ, if there's
any way I can contribute

476
00:27:28,844 --> 00:27:30,072
or help or whatever...

477
00:27:30,145 --> 00:27:32,443
You can help by just being yourself.

478
00:27:32,514 --> 00:27:35,483
Well, I can tell you some stories.

479
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:36,575
Now, look...

480
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:38,620
I'm sorry about
the interruption.

481

Too much revelry late at night,

482
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,250
you forget there's other people
in the world.

Oh, yeah.
An ear infection.

676
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:46,044

No.

693

I guess it's something
about my work.

694
00:39:29,063 --> 00:39:31,293
I get so worked up over it.

695
00:39:31,365 --> 00:39:33,663
I don't have much attention left over,

696
00:39:33,734 --> 00:39:36,635
so it would be a little... unfair.

697
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,138
Yeah. Ladies do ask for attention.

698
00:39:39,206 --> 00:39:41,674
In my experience,
they pretend to give it,

699
00:39:41,742 --> 00:39:43,141
but it's generally a smoke screen

700
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,144

This will sometimes help.

834
00:45:25,352 --> 00:45:27,377
That doesn't help anything, Bill.

835
00:45:27,454 --> 00:45:29,820
I've never found that
to help my writing.

836
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:31,653
Your writing?

837
00:45:31,725 --> 00:45:35,354
Son, have you ever heard
the story of Solomon's mammy?

838
00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:37,329
Barton, you should read this.

839
00:45:37,398 --> 00:45:38,831
I think it's Bill's finest,

840
00:45:38,899 --> 00:45:40,332
or among his finest, anyway.

841
00:45:40,401 --> 00:45:42,335
So now I'm supposed to roll over

842
00:45:42,403 --> 00:45:43,768
and get my belly scratched?

843

Bill.

844
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:45,964
Look, uh...

845
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:47,939
maybe it's none of my business,

846
00:45:48,008 --> 00:45:50,943
but don't you think
a man with your talent...

847
00:45:51,011 --> 00:45:52,945
your first obligation
is to your gift?

848
00:45:53,013 --> 00:45:55,311
Shouldn't you be doing
whatever you have to

849
00:45:55,382 --> 00:45:56,610
to work again?

850
00:45:56,683 --> 00:45:58,275
What would that be?

00:45:58,352 --> 00:45:59,580
I don't know.

852
00:45:59,653 --> 00:46:00,881
But with that drink,

853
00:46:00,954 --> 00:46:03,149
you're cutting yourself
off from your gift

854
00:46:03,223 --> 00:46:04,520
and your fellow man

855

Putting up a levee

860
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:16,099

861
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,637
from lapping at my door.

862
00:46:17,704 --> 00:46:19,137

under his manure.

Not anything, Bill.

Don't test me.

You're lucky she puts up with you
as much as she does.

the human heart, though,

871
00:46:36,557 --> 00:46:38,491
maybe they'd say,
"Bill over here,

he gives his honey love,

usually they're simple morality tales.

1243
01:03:40,712 --> 01:03:44,273
There's a good wrestler
and a bad wrestler,

1244
01:03:44,349 --> 01:03:46,408
whom he confronts at the end.

1245
01:03:46,484 --> 01:03:48,816
In between, the good wrestler
has a love interest

1246
01:03:48,887 --> 01:03:51,788
or a small child he has to protect.

1247
01:03:51,856 --> 01:03:53,619
Bill would usually make
the good wrestler

1248
01:03:53,692 --> 01:03:56,092
a backwards type or a convict,

1249
01:03:56,161 --> 01:03:59,562
and sometimes, instead of a waif,

1250
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:03,328
he'd have the wrestler
protecting an idiot man-child.

1251
01:04:03,401 --> 01:04:06,393
The studio always hated that.

You got to carry on till I get back.

1501
01:21:48,131 --> 01:21:50,998
Try and stay here.
Don't talk to anyone.

1502
01:21:51,068 --> 01:21:53,161
We got to keep our heads,

1503
01:21:53,236 --> 01:21:55,136
and we'll figure it out.

1504
01:21:55,205 --> 01:21:56,172
Okay, but...

1505
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:57,171
Don't argue.

1506
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:00,698
You asked me to believe you and I do.

1507
01:22:00,777 --> 01:22:02,244
Now, don't argue with me.

1508
01:22:02,312 --> 01:22:06,749
Look, pal,
can you do something for me?

1509
01:22:06,817 --> 01:22:09,684
Keep that for me
till I get back.

1510
01:22:09,753 --> 01:22:11,584
It's just a lot of personal stuff,

1511
01:22:11,655 --> 01:22:14,590
but I don't want
to drag it with me.

1512
01:22:14,658 --> 01:22:15,920

1513
01:22:15,993 --> 01:22:18,928

that's important to a guy,

1514
01:22:18,996 --> 01:22:21,931
everything he wants to keep
from a lifetime,

1515
01:22:21,999 --> 01:22:26,959
and he can fit it all
into a little box like that.

1516
01:22:27,037 --> 01:22:29,267
I guess...

1517
01:22:29,339 --> 01:22:31,603
I guess it's pretty pathetic.

1518
01:22:31,675 --> 01:22:33,973
It's more than I've got.

1519
01:22:35,045 --> 01:22:36,478
Well, keep it for me.

1520
01:22:36,546 --> 01:22:38,480

that I'm making too much noise.

1816
01:44:25,919 --> 01:44:27,910
I'm sorry.

1817
01:44:34,995 --> 01:44:37,122
Don't be.

1818
01:45:24,711 --> 01:45:27,805
I'll be next door
if you need me.

1819
01:45:31,785 --> 01:45:33,116
Oh...

1820
01:45:33,187 --> 01:45:35,678
I dropped in on
your folks in New York.

1821
01:45:35,756 --> 01:45:38,748
And Uncle Maury.

1822
01:45:38,825 --> 01:45:40,224
Good people.

1823
01:45:46,567 --> 01:45:49,502
By the way,
that package I gave you...

1824
01:45:49,570 --> 01:45:51,094
I lied.

1825
01:45:51,171 --> 01:45:53,196
It isn't mine.

1826
01:46:57,271 --> 01:46:58,602
Fink.

1827
01:46:58,672 --> 01:47:00,105
Samuel or Lillian Fink.

1828
01:47:00,173 --> 01:47:01,606
85 Fulton Street.

1829
01:47:01,675 --> 01:47:03,142
Or Uncle Maury.

1830
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:06,043
I understand that,
but there's still no answer.

1831
01:47:06,113 --> 01:47:07,045
Mr. Fink?

1832
01:47:07,114 --> 01:47:10,049
Shall I check for trouble
on the line?

1833
01:47:15,922 --> 01:47:18,186
Fink.

1834
01:47:18,258 --> 01:47:19,623
Mr. Lipnick.

1835
01:47:19,693 --> 01:47:22,127
Colonel Lipnick...
if you don't mind.

1836
01:47:22,195 --> 01:47:23,457
Sit down.

1837
01:47:23,530 --> 01:47:25,657
I was commissioned yesterday
in the army reserve.

1838
01:47:25,732 --> 01:47:28,462
Henry Morgenthau arranged it.
Dear friend.

1839
01:47:28,535 --> 01:47:30,435
Congratulations.

1840
01:47:30,504 --> 01:47:31,630
It hasn't officially
gone through yet.

1841
01:47:31,705 --> 01:47:33,138
Had wardrobe whip this up.

1842
01:47:33,206 --> 01:47:35,174
Got to pull teeth
to get anything done.

1843
01:47:35,242 --> 01:47:37,472
Can understand
red tape in peacetime,

1844
01:47:37,544 --> 01:47:39,637
but now it's all-out warfare
against theJaps.

1845
01:47:39,713 --> 01:47:42,409
They'd love to see me
sit this one out.

1846
01:47:42,482 --> 01:47:44,973
Yes, sir.
They, uh...

1847
01:47:45,052 --> 01:47:48,681
Anyway, I had Lou
read your script for me.

1848
01:47:48,755 --> 01:47:51,189
I got to tell you, Fink...

1849
01:47:51,258 --> 01:47:52,885
it won't wash.

1850
01:47:52,959 --> 01:47:53,983
With all due respect,

1851
01:47:54,061 --> 01:47:56,325
I think it's
the best work I've done.

1852
01:47:56,396 --> 01:47:57,624
Don't gas me, Fink.

1853
01:47:57,698 --> 01:48:01,657
If your opinion mattered,
I'd let you run the studio.

1854
01:48:01,735 --> 01:48:04,203
The lunatics aren't going to run
this particular asylum.

1855
01:48:04,271 --> 01:48:07,008
Let's put a stop
to that rumor right now.

1856
01:48:07,141 --> 01:48:09,268
Yes, sir.

1857
01:48:09,343 --> 01:48:10,901
Had to call Beery this morning,

1858
01:48:10,978 --> 01:48:13,640
tell him we were pushing
the picture back.

1859
01:48:13,714 --> 01:48:15,614
After all I told him about quality,

1860
01:48:15,683 --> 01:48:16,945
about that Barton Fink feeling,

1861
01:48:17,018 --> 01:48:18,417
how disappointed we were.

1862
01:48:18,486 --> 01:48:21,421
Wally was heartbroken.
The man was devastated.

1863
01:48:21,489 --> 01:48:23,923
I didn't actually call him.
Lou did.

1864
01:48:23,991 --> 01:48:26,721
That's a fair description,
isn't it, Lou?

1865
01:48:26,794 --> 01:48:27,783
Yes, Colonel.

1866
01:48:27,862 --> 01:48:31,298
I could take you
through it step-by-step,

1867
01:48:31,365 --> 01:48:33,299
explaining why
your story stinks,

1868
01:48:33,367 --> 01:48:35,767
but I won't insult
your intelligence.

1869
01:48:35,836 --> 01:48:36,825
Well, all right.

1870
01:48:36,904 --> 01:48:39,270
First of all,
this is a wrestling picture.

1871
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:42,605
The audience wants to see action,
adventure, wrestling.

1872
01:48:42,676 --> 01:48:45,975
They don't want to see a guy
wrestling with his soul.

1873
01:48:46,047 --> 01:48:47,605
All right, some for the critics.

1874
01:48:47,681 --> 01:48:50,149
You make it the carrot
that wags the dog.

1875
01:48:50,217 --> 01:48:52,048
Too much,
they head for the exits.

1876
01:48:52,119 --> 01:48:55,054
There's plenty of poetry
inside that ring, Fink.

1877
01:48:55,122 --> 01:48:57,317
Look at <i>Hell 10 Feet Square.</i>

1878
01:48:57,391 --> 01:48:58,653
<i>Blood, Sweat, and Canvas.</i>

1879
01:48:58,726 --> 01:48:59,886
<i>Blood, Sweat, and Canvas.</i>

1880
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:02,929
These are big movies,
Fink, about big men.

1881
01:49:02,997 --> 01:49:03,895
In tights!

1882
01:49:03,964 --> 01:49:06,364
Both physically
and mentally...

1883
01:49:06,434 --> 01:49:08,163
especially physically.

1884
01:49:08,235 --> 01:49:10,829
We don't put Wally Beery
in a fruity movie about suffering.

1885
01:49:10,905 --> 01:49:13,772
I thought we were
together on that.

1886
01:49:15,042 --> 01:49:17,408
I'm sorry if I let you down.

1887
01:49:17,478 --> 01:49:19,503
You didn't let me down
or even Lou.

1888
01:49:19,580 --> 01:49:22,344
We don't live or die
by what you scribble.

1889
01:49:22,416 --> 01:49:23,678
You let Ben Geisler down.

1890
01:49:23,751 --> 01:49:25,685
He liked you,
trusted you.

1891
01:49:25,753 --> 01:49:27,721
That's why he's gone.
He's fired.

1892
01:49:27,788 --> 01:49:29,688
That man had a big heart.

1893
01:49:29,757 --> 01:49:30,951
You fucked him.

1894
01:49:31,025 --> 01:49:33,186
He tried to convince me
to fire you, too,

1895
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:34,693
but that'd be too easy.

1896
01:49:34,762 --> 01:49:36,696
You're under contract.
You'll stay that way.

1897
01:49:36,764 --> 01:49:39,198
Anything you write is
property of Capitol Pictures.

1898
01:49:39,266 --> 01:49:42,201
Capitol Pictures won't produce
anything you write...

1899
01:49:42,269 --> 01:49:44,760
not until you
grow up a little.

1900
01:49:44,839 --> 01:49:47,239
You ain't no writer, Fink.

1901
01:49:47,308 --> 01:49:49,776
You're a goddamn write-off.

1902
01:49:51,479 --> 01:49:54,744
I... I tried to show you...

1903
01:49:54,815 --> 01:49:56,214
something beautiful.

1904
01:49:58,285 --> 01:50:00,253
Something about all of us.

1905
01:50:00,321 --> 01:50:01,379
I...

1906
01:50:01,455 --> 01:50:05,221
You arrogant
son of a bitch.

1907
01:50:05,292 --> 01:50:07,658
You think
you're the only writer

1908
01:50:07,728 --> 01:50:10,196
that can give me
that Barton Fink feeling?

1909
01:50:10,264 --> 01:50:12,789
I got 20 writers
under contract

1910
01:50:12,867 --> 01:50:15,734
I can ask for
a Fink-type thing from!

1911
01:50:15,803 --> 01:50:17,168
You swell-headed hypocrite.

1912
01:50:17,238 --> 01:50:18,500
You don't get it.

1913
01:50:18,572 --> 01:50:19,834
You think the whole world

1914
01:50:19,907 --> 01:50:21,499
revolves around
whatever rattles

1915
01:50:21,575 --> 01:50:24,669
inside that little
kike head of yours.

1916
01:50:24,745 --> 01:50:27,339
Get him out of my sight, Lou!

1917
01:50:27,414 --> 01:50:29,177
I want him in town, though.

1918
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:30,717
He's still under contract.

1919
01:50:30,784 --> 01:50:34,948
I want you in town
and out of my sight.

1920
01:50:35,022 --> 01:50:37,183
Now, get lost.

1921
01:50:37,258 --> 01:50:38,850
There's a war on.

1922
01:51:37,084 --> 01:51:39,484
It's a beautiful day.

1923
01:51:39,553 --> 01:51:40,679
Huh?

1924
01:51:46,894 --> 01:51:49,829
I said it's a beautiful day.

1925
01:51:49,897 --> 01:51:51,228
Yes.

1926
01:51:51,298 --> 01:51:53,061
It is.

1927
01:51:55,703 --> 01:51:57,694
What's in the box?

1928
01:51:59,607 --> 01:52:01,472
I don't know.

1929
01:52:02,776 --> 01:52:04,539
Isn't it yours?

1930
01:52:09,717 --> 01:52:11,810
I don't know.

1931
01:52:17,758 --> 01:52:19,953
You're very beautiful.

1932
01:52:24,765 --> 01:52:26,824
Are you in pictures?

1933
01:52:28,068 --> 01:52:30,002
Don't be silly.

1934
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,000
