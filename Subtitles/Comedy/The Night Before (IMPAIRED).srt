00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:58,063
NARRATOR: <i>Here's a little
story I'd like to tell</i>

3
00:00:58,065 --> 00:01:02,833
<i>about three best friends
and their first Noel.</i>

4
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:07,004
<i>It begins right
before Christmas 2001,</i>

5
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:10,207
<i>when a young man named
Ethan became an orphan.</i>

6
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:13,911
<i>His mama and papa
both tragically gone,</i>

7
00:01:13,913 --> 00:01:18,917
<i>it seemed for him, Christmas
had sung its swan song.</i>

8
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:21,251
<i>As he sat alone on Christmas Eve,</i>

9
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:24,088
<i>his friends came over
and forced him to leave.</i>

10
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,290
<i>They had to get Ethan
out of his funk,</i>

11
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:30,361
<i>so they went to a bar and
they got his ass drunk.</i>

12
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:33,798
<i>With tears and with sadness
they started to mend.</i>

13
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,965
<i>Then they said:</i>

14
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:37,902
No more crying. This sad shit must end.

15
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:41,206
Christmas was about family,
but now it's about friends.

16
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,974
NARRATOR: <i>Thus began
a new tradition.</i>

17
00:01:43,976 --> 00:01:46,844
<i>The friends hung on Christmas
and fun was their mission.</i>

That shit holds a
hundred songs at one time.

<i>they realized that Christmas

<i>And she turned with a fright.</i>

00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:40,297
Where were you guys
partying earlier tonight?

41
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:43,134
At a place so great words cannot describe

42
00:02:43,136 --> 00:02:45,303
with so many drinks for one to imbibe.

43

With so many drugs, I
can't believe I survived.

What the fuck...

...is this party called?

00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:54,779
Why, you haven't heard?

It's the Nutcracker Ball.

NARRATOR: <i>They asked all
around, but to no avail.</i>

<i>Where was this great party,
this whitest of whales?</i>

51

<i>And though year upon year,
they tried and they failed,</i>

52
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,828
<i>they never did tire,
they never did bail.</i>

53
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,164
<i>But over time, the fun did wane.</i>

54

<i>One friend had a family,
the other had fame.</i>

55

<i>As the years passed,
his boys, they grew up.</i>

is just a little bit stuck.</i>

Not gigs, but gigs are overrated, dude.

Gentlemen,

339
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:26,644
14 years ago to this very
night, a tradition was born.

340
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:28,878
That year some drunk, fucking asshole

341
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,613
hit my parents with a car.

342
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:33,550
So that Christmas, I didn't
have any family to be with,

343
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:35,685
but you guys were there for me.

344
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:36,987
But tonight!

345
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:38,488
Tonight's different.

346
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,692
We have mutually decided
to end this tradition.

347
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:43,126
Isaac's about to have a baby.

348
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:45,062
And Chris is just too fucking famous

349
00:13:45,064 --> 00:13:46,630
- to hang out with us anymore.
- Big man.

350
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:48,665
ETHAN: But guys, earlier today

351
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:52,535
I witnessed a real-life Christmas miracle.

352
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:53,838
Where the fuck did you get those?

353
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,839
- Holy shit! Are those real?
- They are fucking real!

354
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:57,742
ISAAC: Where did they come from?

355
00:13:57,744 --> 00:14:00,377
It doesn't matter! It's a
fucking Christmas miracle!

356
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:01,746
You killed somebody for those?

357
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:02,579
No, I stole them.

358
00:14:02,581 --> 00:14:04,848
ISAAC: That's awesome! What a blowout!

359
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,952
It is the Nutcracker Ball!

360
00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:09,420
ISAAC: Yes!

361
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:11,756
So I called the number on these tickets.

362
00:14:11,758 --> 00:14:14,424
They don't give out the address till 10.

363
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:16,526
So that gives us several hours

364
00:14:16,528 --> 00:14:18,529
to hit as many Christmas
traditions as possible!

365
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:19,963
CHRIS: Let's do it.

366

It's gonna be the best
fucking night of our lives!

368
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:26,138
Maybe it'll be the new Christmas tradition.

369
00:14:27,773 --> 00:14:30,141
I don't know if we're really replacing this

with another tradition.

Give me some credit.
